These features include\nlow power peer-to-peer transmissions, multiple access commu-\nnications, high data rates, and precise positioning capabilities.\nSpace-Time Coding (STC) techniques, such as the block coding\nscheme, or the trellis coding scheme, are known to be simple\nand practical ways to increase the spectral efficiency in wireless\ncommunications. In this paper, we aim to combine Pulse Position\nModulation (PPM) - Impulse Radio Multiple Access (IRMA)\nsystem with two different space-time coding techniques. Thus,\nwe developed a space-time block codes and adapted a space-time\ntrellis codes scheme to UWB signalling, relying on the Channel\nState Information (CSI) at the receiver side. Then the added\ndiversity produces by these techniques is exploited to enhance the\nperformance of UWB systems. Analysis is conducted in a typical\nUWB environment, with Fractionally-Spaced (FS) coherent Rake\ndetection.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nImpulse Radio (IR) is defined as a form of ultra-wide\nbandwidth spread-spectrum signalling which is well designed\nfor base-band asynchronous Multiple Access (MA), short\ndistance-high data rate multimedia services, and tactical wire-\nless communications [1]. Several techniques have been al-\nready investigated in order to deploy an UWB system. Multi\nband carrier-based, implemented through Multi-Carrier Spread\nSpectrum (MC-SS) or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-\nplexing (OFDM). Single band IR, implemented via PPM com-\nbined with random Time-Hopping (TH) or Direct Sequence\n(DS) techniques to allow secure multiple users transmissions.\nConcerning Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems,\nthey are known to provide higher capacity and therefore better\nperformance than single link in wireless communication sys-\ntems by employing multiple transmit, and optionally, multiple\nreceive antennas. Several architectures have been proposed so\nfar to exploit the potential of MIMO systems. Such as Space-\nTime Block Codes (STBC) scheme [2], Space-Time Trellis\nCoded Modulation (STTCM) technique [3], or Layered Space-\nTime Architecture (BLAST). All of which provide high data\nrates with a given transceiver complexity.\nWith 3G systems and beyond requiring high data rates for\napplications such as multimedia, this particular area has gained\na lot of research interest. For example the work reported in\n[5], proposed an IR system exploiting two transmit antennas\nand employing a STBC scheme. The scheme is based on\nan Alamouti-type encoder [2], adapted to an analog non\nlinearly PPM multi-antenna IR system. This work shows an\nimprovement in the Bit-Error-Rate (BER). Next we proposed a\ndifferent scheme based on a similar idea [6], and combined an\nMIMO-IR system with orthogonal pulses, to enhance the data\nrate. This paper is an extension of our previous work. We reuse\nthat scheme and modified it in order to take advantage of the\nCSI. We also adapt a traditional narrow-band STTCM encoder,\nwhere data are trellis encoded across the transmit antennas, to\nimpulse radio signalling. This technique is known to provide\ncoding gain in addition to the diversity gain obtained by the\nuse of multiple antennas in a narrow band environment. Thus\nthis paper investigates the performance enhancement these\nSTC techniques can bring to an UWB system, and challenge\ntheir relevance in typical UWB environment.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follow, Section II\nbriefly introduces the PPM-IRMA model, for both DS-UWB\nand TH-UWB. Section III provides basic understanding of the\nHermitian pulses [7], and derivation of our STBC scheme\nis presented. Next section IV describes how the STTCM is\nadapted to IR signalling. Then section V gives information\nabout the system model and presents our simulation results.\nEventually section VI, concludes the paper.\nII. PPM-IRMA MODELLING\nThis section briefly describes the PPM-IRMA model [4].\nThe waveform transmitted by the u-th user regarding a trans-\nmission of Ns symbols per user, using TH sequence for\naccommodated these users is expressed :\n\u03c9u(t) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5u\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nw(t\u2212 zTf \u2212Cu(z)Tc \u2212 TIu(i)) (1)\nWhere z = iNf + k. Each symbol is transmitted over a\nsymbol period Ts, Ts = NfTf . Nf is the number of frame per\nsymbol and Tf is the frame period. w(t) is a UWB transmitted\npulse with width Tw. Nu users is accommodated using TH\nsequence, thus each frame contains Nc chips of duration Tc,\nTf = NcTc + Tg . Tg is a guard time for processing delay.\nEach frame contains only one pulse per user. Cu(z) is the TH\npseudo-random sequence Np periodic, Cu(z) \u2208 [0, Nc \u2212 1].\n\u03b5u denotes the u-th user transmit energy, and Iu(i) represents\nthe information bearing the i-th transmitted symbol sent by\nthe u-th user, Iu(i) \u2208 [0,M \u2212 1]. TIu(i) is the delay related\nto Iu(i). This delay represents the shift in position of the\nGlobecom 2004 3225 0-7803-8794-5\/04\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nIEEE Communications Society\npulse in the set of all possible position-shifting, according\nto the M -ary PPM. The modulation is set to be orthogonal,\nso each time interval Tc is equally sliced in M possible\nposition-shifting \u21d2 TIu(i)=\n(\nIu(i)\nM\n)\nTc. Otherwise, PPM can\nalso be combined with DS sequence to accommodate several\nusers. In that case Cu(z) \u2208 {\u00b11} is called the direct spread\nsequence, TIu(i)=\n(\nIu(i)\nM\n)\nTf . Equation (1) is rewritten as\nfollow, considering DS sequence with PPM:\n\u03c9u(t) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5u\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nCu(z)w(t\u2212 zTw \u2212 TIu(i)) (2)\nThe number of users accommodated and the level of Inter-\nSymbol Interference (ISI) can be modified via the pulse\nrepetition gain: 10 log10(Nf ), and the duty cycle gain:\n10 log10\n(\nTf\nTw\n)\n. A low repetition gain implies more ISI, mul-\ntiple users collisions and problems of synchronization. A high\nrepetition gain implies a lower data rate. Considering TH-\nUWB, a low duty cycle provides a good protection against\ncatastrophic collision in multi-user environment [4]. The duty\ncycle gain is fixed for DS-UWB.\nIII. STBC SCHEME WITH HERMITIAN PULSES\nThis part of the paper presents the implementation of our\nSTBC scheme. It also provides a step by step derivation of\nthe scheme considering a peer-to-peer data transmission. Next\nis introduced the set of orthogonal pulses used to implement\nour STBC scheme.\nA. Modified Hermitian Pulses\nThe set of Modified Hermitian Pulses (MHP) retained\nour attention because of the attractive features it provides,\nand its simplicity to implement [7]. The expression of each\nnormalized unit-energy pulse is given via the formulae below,\nwhere n is the order of the pulse, (i.e. the number of zero\ncrossings). Equation (3) gives the common expression of each\nMHP:\nHn(t) =\n(\u22121)n\u221a\nn!\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\ne\nt2\n4\ndn\ndtn\n(\ne\n\u2212t2\n2\n)\n(3)\nNext, introducing the width T0 and the center time T1 for each\nnormalized unit-energy pulse, equation (3) becomes:\n\u03c5n(t) =\n\u221a\n2(\u22121)n\n(8\u03c0)\nn\n2\n\u221a\nn!\ne\n2\u03c0\n(\nt\u2212T1\nT0\n)2\nT\n(n\u2212 12 )\n0\ndn\ndtn\n(\ne\n\u22124\u03c0\n(\nt\u2212T1\nT0\n)2)\n(4)\nThe magnitude spectrum of each normalized unit-energy pulse\nis given by:\n\u03a5n(f) =\njnF\n(n\u2212 12 )\n0\n(2\u03c0)\nn\n2\n\u221a\nn!\ne\n2\u03c0\n((\nf\n2F0\n)2\u2212jfT1\n)\ndn\ndfn\n(\ne\n\u2212\u03c0\n(\nf\nF0\n)2)\n(5)\n,where F0 = 1\/T0. It is also important to note that this scheme\ncould work with others set of orthogonal pulses, as long as\nthe orthogonally between pulses is not utterly destroyed.\nB. STBC Scheme\nHere is now presented the derivation of our scheme through\nstep by step analysis. Considering a Nt transmit antennas, N\u03c1\nreceive antennas, single user configuration.\n1) Encoding and Transmission: At any given time, the\ninput of the system is feeded with bits. Which are next mapped\nvia a \u201dM -level Encoder\u201d into an \u201dinformation stream\u201d, and\nthen split into Nt sub-streams to allow the transmission of\nNt different symbols over Nt transmit antennas. Each sub-\nstream is eventually transformed into waveforms \u03c9n(t, a, b)\nthrough the pulse position modulator, using Nt MHP. A\nsingle user configuration is here considered, Cu(z) in (1),\n(2) is not required. The following equation (6) presents the\ncommon expression of a waveform sent over the n-th transmit\nantenna, during a frame period Tf , considering a single user\nconfiguration:\n\u03c9n(t, a, b) =\n1\u221a\nNt\n\u03c5c\n(\nt\u2212\n(\nb +\nIn(a)\nM\n)\nTf\n)\n(6)\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\na = iNt + [(Nt \u2212 l + n) mod Nt]\nb = (iNt + l)\nNf\nNt\n+ k\nc = [(Nt \u2212 l + n) mod Nt]\nWhere:\n\u2022 a is the index of the symbol currently encoded.\n\u2022 b is the index of the waveform created to encoded In(a)\nwithin the entire signal.\n\u2022 c is the order of the current MHP used to encode In(a).\n\u2022 1\/\n\u221a\nNt is introduced to normalize the amount of energy\nsent by each of the Nt transmit antennas. In comparison\nwith the amount of energy sent by a single antenna\nconsidering the single link scheme.\nThe signal \u03c9n(t) sent over the n-th transmit antenna can be\nexpressed:\n\u03c9n(t) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5\nNf\n(Ns\/Nt)\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNt\u22121\u2211\nl=0\n(Nf\/Nt)\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c9n(t, a, b) (7)\n\u2126(t) the transmission vector is next defined such as each of\nits Nt elements represent the signal transmitted from each of\nthe Nt transmit antennas.\n\u2126(t) = [\u03c90(t), . . . , \u03c9n(t), . . . , \u03c9Nt\u22121(t)] (8)\nConcerning the channel, it is modelled for each link between\nthe n-th transmit and the \u03c1-th receive antenna by a finite im-\npulse response signal h\u03c1,n(t). Each link is assumed to undergo\na different distortion. Considering an indoor environment, the\nDoppler spectrum is quasi-constant, and thus the distortion\nis assumed to be constant during several symbols (very slow\nfading). The channel can be represented by a [N\u03c1 \u00d7 Nt]\nmatrix H(t), where each of its elements h\u03c1,n(t) represents\nthe distortion undergone by each link:\nh\u03c1,n(t) = X\nP\u2211\np=0\nQ\u2211\nq=0\n\u03b1\u03c1,n,p,q\u03b4(t\u2212 T\u03c1,n,p \u2212 \u03c4\u03c1,n,p,q) (9)\nGlobecom 2004 3226 0-7803-8794-5\/04\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nIEEE Communications Society\nThe channel model described here, is the IEEE UWB channel\nmodel presented in [8]. It is based on the Saleh-Valenzuela\nmodel where multipath component arrive in clusters. It has\nbeen modified to match the real UWB multipath amplitude dis-\ntribution, which has been reported in [8] to be log-normal. The\nphase component \u03b8\u03c1,n,p,q is uniformly distributed, \u03b8\u03c1,n,p,q \u2208\n{\u00b11}. The mathematical expression of the channel response\nis given in equation (9). Where the multipath gain \u03b1\u03c1,n,p,q ,\nincludes the amplitude and phase components of the \u03c1, n-th\nlink , p-th cluster and q-th ray. T\u03c1,n,p is the time of arrival of\nthe p-th cluster and \u03c4\u03c1,n,p,q is the time of arrival of the q-th ray\nwithin the p-th cluster, considering the \u03c1, n-th link. X models\nthe log-normal shadowing, X = 10(Y\/20). Y follow a normal\ndistribution law, with 0 dB mean value and 3 dB standard\ndeviation. Further in section (V-A), more details about the\nchannel model and its implementation are provided. At this\npoint, the received signal per receive antenna is expressed as\na convolution product of \u2126(t) and H(t)T , plus a zero mean,\nN0\n2 variance, additive gaussian noise, n\u03c1(t).\nr\u03c1(t) =\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u222b\nR\n\u03c9n(\u03c4)h\u03c1,n(t\u2212 \u03c4)d\u03c4 + n\u03c1(t) (10)\n2) Receiver and matched filtering: In order to retrieve each\nsymbol within the received signal with great accuracy, matched\nfiltering techniques combined with FS coherent rake receiver\ncan be implemented. Through Data Aided (DA) channel\nestimation techniques and Fg fingers FS-rake receiver [10], the\namplitude, phase and time components of the channel response\nh\u03c1,n(t) are estimated. The estimated channel matrix is denoted\nH\u02dc(t) and h\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) stand for the estimation of h\u03c1,n(t). The\nmatched filtering process consists in the creation of matched\nsignals for each orthogonal pulse used at the transmission\nside. Moreover, according to the modulation level, there is M\npossible matched signals for each possible shifted position of\nthe pulse within a frame duration Tf . The matched waveform\nconsidering the n-th MHP, per Nf\/Nt frames, per possible\nsymbol position is expressed as follow:\n\u03c9n(t, i, l,m) =\n(Nf\/Nt)\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n1\u221a\nNt\n\u03c5n\n(\nt\u2212\n(\nb +\nm\nM\n)\nTf\n)\n(11)\n\u2126n(t, i,m) regroups the waveforms defined in (11) such as:\n\u2126n(t, i,m) = [\u03c9n(t, i, 0,m), . . . , \u03c9n(t, i,Nt \u2212 1,m)] (12)\nNext, H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) is defined as the n\u2212th left circular permutation\nof the row vector H\u02dc\u03c1(t) of the matrix H\u02dc(t):\nH\u02dc\u03c1,n(t) = [h\u02dc\u03c1,n,0(t), . . . , h\u02dc\u03c1,n,l(t), . . . , h\u02dc\u03c1,n,Nt\u22121(t)]\nh\u02dcn,l(t) = h\u02dc[(l+n) mod Nt](t)\n(13)\nThen the convolution product of \u2126n(t, i,m) and H\u02dc\u03c1,n(t)T\nproduces matched signals on each transmitted symbol per\nreceive antenna:\ns\u02dc\u03c1,n(t, i,m) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5\nNf\nNt\u22121\u2211\nl=0\n\u222b\nR\n\u03c9n(\u03c4, i, l,m)h\u02dc\u03c1,n,l(t\u2212 \u03c4)d\u03c4\n(14)\nAccording to the scheme presently analyzed, Nt different\nsymbols are transmitted inside a NfTf duration. So if each\nsignal s\u02dc\u03c1,n(t, i,m) is correlated with the received signal r\u03c1(t),\nover NfTf , each symbol is demodulated independently:\n\u039b(j,m) =\nN\u03c1\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\nNt\u22121\u2211\nl=0\n\u222b (iNt+l+1)NfNt Tf\n(iNt+l)\nNf\nNt\nTf\n\u0393r\u03c1,s\u02dc\u03c1,n(0)dt (15)\nWhere \u0393x,y(\u03c4) =\n\u222b\nR\nx(t)y\u2217(t \u2212 \u03c4)dt.

STTCM FOR IMPULSE RADIO\nIn this part is presented the adaption of STTCM technique to\nIR signalling. As reported in [3], considering a M modulation\nlevel, prior to STTC encoding process itself, the input bit\nstream is parsed into K = log2(M) sub-streams. Each of\nthis sub-streams, at any time i, feeds the inputs b0i through\nto bK\u22121i . Where b0i is the most significant bit and b\nK\u22121\ni the\nleast significant one. The K sub-streams of bits are then\nmultiply simultaneously by generator coefficients ajn,l. Where\nn \u2208 {0, N \u2212 1}, j \u2208 {0,K \u2212 1}, l \u2208 {0, \u03bdj}, and \u03bdj\nis the memory order per branch. The output of the encoder\nIn(i), is then obtained by adding modulo M , all the values of\neach branch of the encoder. In(i) is a scalar value, so called\ninformation, In(i) \u2208 {0,M \u2212 1} :\nIn(i) =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edK\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n\u03bdj\u2211\nl=0\najn,lb\nj\ni\u2212l\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 mod M (19)\nThen, In(i) is mapped into waveform \u03c9n(t, i, k) via the pulse\nposition modulator. Considering a single user configuration,\n\u03c9n(t) is expressed as:\n\u03c9n(t) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5\nNf\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nNf\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c9n(t, i, k)\n\u03c9n(t, i, k) =\n1\u221a\nNt\nw\n(\nt\u2212\n(\niNf + k +\nIn(i)\nM\n)\nTf\n) (20)\nGlobecom 2004 3227 0-7803-8794-5\/04\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nIEEE Communications Society\nAdding channel effect defined in (9) and zero-mean, N0\/2\nvariance gaussian noise, the received signal per receive antenna\nis expressed:\nr\u03c1(t) =\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u222b\nR\n\u03c9n(\u03c4)h\u03c1,n(t\u2212 \u03c4)d\u03c4 + n\u03c1(t) (21)\nA STTC encoder can be described by a trellis dia-\ngram. The encoder produces codeword I(i), where I(i) =\n[I0(i), . . . , INt\u22121(i)] , which is effectively the set of informa-\ntion along a given path through the trellis. An error occurs\nwhen the receiver makes an erroneous decision and chooses\nI \u2032(i) = [I \u20320(i), . . . , I\n\u2032\nNt\u22121(i)] as the most likely codeword.\nThus the trellis allows only a set of possible errors. The Viterbi\nalgorithm determines the set. Otherwise the matched received\nsignal s\u02dc\u03c1(t) is designed according to, matched filtering ,chan-\nnel estimation and rake receiving techniques, considering each\npossible error codeword:\ns\u02dc\u03c1(t) =\n\u221a\n\u03b5\nNf\nNt\u22121\u2211\nn=0\n\u222b\nR\n\u03c9n(\u03c4, i, k)h\u02dc\u03c1,n(t\u2212 \u03c4)d\u03c4\n\u03c9n(t, i, k) =\n1\u221a\nNt\nw\n(\nt\u2212\n(\niNf + k +\nI \u2032n(i)\nM\n)\nTf\n) (22)\nThe STTCM decoder is based on a ML Viterbi algorithm. The\nViterbi algorithm tracks valid code sequences within the trellis,\nand selects the one that is the closest to the received sequence\nbased on the Euclidean distance path metric. An Error Event\nPath (EEP) is defined as a possible received path through the\ntrellis that begins and ends in the same state as the transmitted\npath, but diverges in between. An optimal decoder must only\nchoose paths that follow the trellis, and the only manner in\nwhich it can make an error is by following an EEP. The EEP\nis based on legitimate errors only. At any time i, the Euclidean\ndistance path metric between each received signal per receive\nantenna r\u03c1(t) and each possible matched received signal s\u02dc\u03c1(t)\nis computed. Finally the Viterbi algorithm selects among all\nthe possible EEP d, the path with the lowest accumulated path\nmetric dmin as decoded sequence.\nd =\nNs\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nN\u03c1\u22121\u2211\n\u03c1=0\n\u222b (i+1)NfTf\niNfTf\n(r\u03c1(t)\u2212 s\u02dc\u03c1(t))2 dt (23)\nV. SYSTEM MODEL AND RESULTS\nA. System Model\nThe simulations are based on the IEEE UWB channel\nmodel. Four different models have been presented in [10].\nIn this paper, the performances of our different schemes are\nmainly investigated over the channel model refereed in [10]\nas CM1. This model assumes a channel response constant\nover 200 \u00b5s, and independent between packets. Otherwise,\nconcerning coherent detection, FS-rake detector has been\npresented in [10]. It is said to provide good performance,\nclose to ML one, for much lower complexity. It requires to\nsample the receive signal, after the match filtering process, at\nleast as fast as the Nyquest rate. Finally, several techniques\nfor channel estimation for UWB are also presented in [10].\nConcerning this work, perfect channel estimation is assumed.\nB. Simulation Parameters\n\u2022 Modulation setting: a 4-PPM is implemented with a\nrepetition gain of 10dB, and a duty cycle of 6dB.\n\u2022 Pulse setting: concerning the single link and the STTC-IR\nscheme, normalized unit-energy second derivative of the\nGaussian pulse is implemented. Otherwise concerning the\nSTBC scheme, MHP of order n = 1, 2 are implemented.\nThe pulse duration of each pulse is 0.7 ns, the pulse width\nT0 is 0.2877 ns, and the pulse center T1 is 0.35 ns.\n\u2022 Both bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER)\nare computed using 400 bits packets, with at least 100\nchannel realization of CM1 and 400000 bits transmitted\nor at least 100 bits in error, for each Signal to Noise Ratio\n(SNR) value .\n\u2022 Synchronization is assumed to be perfect.\n\u2022 The FS-rake sampling rate is 14,28 GHz.\nBE\nR\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-410\n10\n10\n10\n10\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 26\nSNR (dB)\n2824\nSTTC 4st N =2 N =1 F =1\nSTTC 4st N =2 N =1\nAWGN\ngt\nt\nr\nr\nSL F =1\nSL \nSTBC N =2 N =1 F =1\nSTBC N =2 N =1\nSTBC N =2 N =2 F =1\nSTBC N =2 N =2\ng\ng\ng\nt\nt\nt\nr\nr\nr\nr\nt\nFig. 1.

Results\nFig 1. depicts the BER against SNR performance compari-\nson of the single link scheme, the STBC scheme for various\nnumbers of receive antennas, N\u03c1 = 1, 2, the STTC scheme,\nconsidering a 4-PPM. And the AWGN channel. Two scenarios\nare discussed. The plain curves are obtained for a P.Q = 10\nmultipath channel and 1 finger FS-rake coherent detector. The\ndotted curves are plotted for a P.Q = 1 multipath channel\nand FS-rake-1. Concerning the first scenario, the performances\nof each scheme are quite similarly bad, only the receive\nantenna diversity enables to enhance them. The thresholds\nobserved put into light the effects of mainly IPI and ISI.\nOtherwise, considering the second scenario, when there are\nno IPI (theoretical case), the STBC scheme performs slightly\nworst than the single link one, but with slightly more diversity\nand double data rate. The STTC scheme outperforms both of\nthem by a least 2.2 dB at 10\u22124. One added receive antenna\nenhances the BER by 4 dB at 10\u22124, considering the STBC\nscheme.\nGlobecom 2004 3228 0-7803-8794-5\/04\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nIEEE Communications Society\nBE\nR\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-410\n10\n10\n10\n10\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\nSNR (dB)\nSL \nSTBC N =2 N  =1\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 low\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 high\nt\nt\nt\np\np\np\nFig. 2. BER performance comparison of the single link scheme versus the\nSTBC scheme and the STTC scheme, 4-PPM, P.Q = 10, FS-rake-10.\nIn figure 2. is presented the BER versus SNR performance\ncomparison of the single link, the STBC scheme, and the\nSTTC scheme for two different sets of values of generator\ncoefficients, ajn,l. Considering a 4-PPM, P.Q = 10 multipath\nchannel, and a 10 fingers FS-rake coherent detector. The\nperformance gap between the STBC scheme and the single\nlink scheme seems to increase when the number of fingers\nincrease. Otherwise, the STTC scheme still provides better\nperformance than the two other schemes, and that performance\nenhancement can be tuned via the generator coefficients, as\nin narrow-band environment. Considering the UWB environ-\nment, new performance criterion has to be found.\nFinally, Fig 3. shows the FER versus SNR performance\ncomparison of the single link, STTC scheme for two different\nsets of values of generator coefficients, ajn,l. Considering\nvarious numbers of receive antennas, N\u03c1 = 1, 2, a 4-PPM,\nP.Q = 1, 10 multipath channel, and a 1 or 10 fingers FS-\nrake coherent detector. The results show that STTC scheme\nin UWB environment exhibits the same kind of performance\nenhancement as in narrow-band environment. The difference\nof improvement between two sets of generator coefficients\nseems to grow with the level of diversity for a 4 states STTC\nscheme [11]. This emphases the necessity to find the optimal\ngenerator coefficients.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nTwo different schemes have been presented, a STBC scheme\nimplemented via MHP and a STTC scheme for IR. Their\nperformance have been analyzed over the IEEE UWB channel\nmodel [8] combined with the FS-rake coherent detection tech-\nnique. The STBC scheme provides space diversity, increases\nby Nt times the data rate. But nevertheless it does not performs\nso well considering a large number of fingers, mainly because\nthe IPI seem to alter the orthogonality between MHP. The\nSTTC scheme provides space diversity, and enhances BER and\nFER performance with higher complexity. Optimal generator\ncoefficients have to be found for UWB environment.\n0\n-110\n10\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 22 24 26\nSNR (dB)\nFE\nR\nSL N  =1 F =1\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 F =1 low\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 F =1 high\nSL N  =2 F =1\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =2 F =1 low\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =2 F =1 high\nSL N  =1 F =10\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 F =10 low\nSTTC 4st N =2 N  =1 F =10 high\n18 20\nt p\nt p\nt p\nt p\nt p\nt p\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\ngp\np\np\nFig. 3.

Then STC schemes for IR could\nimprove further the performances, increase the data rate or\nincrease the coverage area. Based on this work, our future\ninvestigation could be to test the performances of the schemes\nwe presented here, in the other channel scenarios and with\ndifferent channel estimation techniques reported in [10].\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
