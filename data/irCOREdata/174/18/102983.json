Comparisons to public gene databases indicate that the cDNA collection\nrepresents more than 2,000 new, full-length transcripts. This resource defines the structure and\nthe coding potential of a large fraction of B-cell specific and housekeeping genes whose function\ncan be analyzed by disruption in the chicken DT40 B-cell line.\nBackground\nLarge-scale genomic and cDNA sequencing projects have\nrevealed thousands of new genes whose open reading frames\n(ORFs) are highly conserved during vertebrate evolution, but\nwhose precise cellular functions remain unclear. Although\nfunctional analysis by gene disruption is possible after trans-\nfection of murine embryonic stem cells and the breeding of\nknockout mice [1], these whole-animal studies are laborious\nand expensive. If the mutant phenotype can be distinguished\nin cell culture, the chicken B-cell line DT40 is a valid alterna-\ntive to murine knockouts because of its high ratio of targeted\ngene integration [2-4]. Additional advantages of DT40 are\ntightly regulated conditional gene-expression systems for the\nanalysis of essential genes [5-7] and the ability to study\ngenetic interactions by the stepwise modification of multiple\nloci [8] and marker recycling [7].\nThe recent release of the chicken genome sequence [9] greatly\nbenefits the DT40 research community. For the first time, the\nentire genome can be searched for sequences that are con-\nserved during vertebrate evolution and whose function might\nbe clarified after genetic modification in DT40. However, in\nsilico gene structure prediction methods have a high error\nrate and often do not correctly annotate the intron-exon\nPublished: 23 December 2004\nGenome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nReceived: 7 September 2004\nRevised: 26 October 2004\nAccepted: 7 December 2004\nThe electronic version of this article is the complete one and can be \nfound online at http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6Genome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nR6.2 Genome Biology 2004,     Volume 6, Issue 1, Article R6       Caldwell et al. http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6structure of genes. Only full-length cDNAs unambiguously\ndefine the boundaries of the transcription units within whole-\ngenome assemblies and cloned full-length cDNAs are also of\nimmense practical value to complement mutant phenotypes\nand artificially express the encoded protein [10]. For these\nreasons, many genome sequencing projects in higher eukary-\notes have been complemented by large-scale efforts to obtain\na maximum number of full-length cDNAs [11,12]. Although\nrelatively large expressed sequence tag (EST) databases from\nbursal lymphocytes [13] and other tissues have been\ndescribed [14], relatively few chicken cDNA sequences had\nbeen deposited in the public databases.\nHere we describe a project to sequence and characterize a\nlarge number of full-length cDNAs from bursal lymphocytes.\nThe corresponding genes are likely to be expressed in DT40\nand this should facilitate their analysis by targeted gene mod-\nifications. In combination with the recently released cDNAs\nfrom other tissues [15], the bursal cDNAs will be a valuable\nresource for many laboratories working with the chicken as a\nmodel organism.\nResults and discussion\nGeneration of bursal cDNA sequences\nThe overall strategy for producing the greatest possible\nnumber of new full-length cDNAs expressed in bursal lym-\nphocytes is outlined in Figure 1. We previously described a\ncDNA library of bursal lymphocytes, but it contained only a\nlow number of full-length cDNA clones [13]. It was therefore\ndecided to synthesize a new cDNA library, called 'riken1',\nusing the biotinylated cap trapper method which is optimized\nto generate a large percentage of full-length cDNA inserts\n[16]. To assess the quality of the library and guide the selec-\ntion of clones for full insert sequencing, the 5' ends of over\n14,000 clone inserts were sequenced. BLAST [17] searches\nagainst the public protein databases indicated that about 80%\nof the 11,116 high-quality ESTs obtained showed significant\nhomology to existing entries and more than 80% of these\nextended further upstream than the methionine start codon\nof their homologs in the databases. This indicated that the\nriken1 library indeed contains an extraordinary high percent-\nage of full-length cDNA inserts. Only clones whose ESTs\nshowed significant BLAST matches against the public protein\ndatabases and covered the methionine start codon of their\nhomolog were considered for full-length sequencing, as evo-\nlutionarily conserved genes are of highest interest for the\nDT40 research community. The remaining ESTs were clus-\ntered to remove duplicates corresponding to the same gene.\nIn addition, ESTs corresponding to already known chicken\ngenes in the public databases were removed.\nThe plasmids corresponding to the remaining 2,796 ESTs\nwere chosen for full insert sequencing by bidirectional primer\nwalks. Once the end of the walks had been reached, the\nsequences of the full-length cDNA inserts were assembled.\nOutline of full-length bursal cDNA productionFigur 1\nOutline of full-length bursal cDNA production.\nBidirectional primer walks to the ends\nof the cDNA insert\n(2,565 clones completed)\nAssembly of cDNA insert sequence\n(2,527 contigs assembled)\nManual quality check using BLAST search results\nagainst public protein and EST databases\n(2,272 completed)\ncDNA assembly and quality check\nConstruction of new cDNA library from bursal B cells\nTransfer of 45,000 clones into 384-well microtiter plates\n5\u2032 single-pass sequencing of 14,796 cloned cDNA inserts\n11,116 high-quality bursal EST sequences\nEST sequencing\nRemoval of ESTs showing a BLAST score of\nless than 50 against public protein databases\n(8,876 ESTs retained)\nRemoval of EST cluster duplicates\n(4,660 ESTs retained)\nRemoval of ESTs corresponding to known\nchicken transcripts\n(3,033 ESTs retained)\nClone selection for full insert sequencing\nRemoval of ESTs unlikely to be full length\n(2,796 ESTs retained)\nClones corresponding to retained ESTs\nselected for full insert sequencingGenome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6 Genome Biology 2004,     Volume 6, Issue 1, Article R6       Caldwell et al. R6.3\nco\nm\nm\nent\nreview\ns\nrepo\nrts\nrefereed research\ndepo\nsited research\ninteractio\nns\ninfo\nrm\natio\nnFrom the BLAST search results the most likely methionine\nstart codon was assigned to each sequence. About 15% of the\ncDNA sequences showed evidence for premature frameshifts\nin the form of short ORFs and stretches of conserved\nsequence in a different frame further 3'. If overlapping ESTs\nwere found in the public databases, the cDNA sequences were\nedited to correct the likely reverse transcription error, other-\nwise these sequences were discarded.\nLength distribution and GC content\nA total of 2,272 high-quality chicken full-length cDNA clones\nwere sequenced and assembled, manually annotated with\nrespect to their likely translation start codon and deposited\nboth at The Bursal Transcript Database website [18] and in\nthe public databases. The lengths of the proteins encoded by\nthe annotated ORFs were compared with the lengths of Uni-\nProt [19] database entries and the lengths of the untranslated\nregion (UTR) sequences were compared with the lengths of\nknown vertebrate UTRs available from the UtrDB collection\n[20] (Figure 2). The distributions obtained for the bursal\ncDNAs closely resemble those calculated for known\nsequences. Most of the 5' UTRs have lengths in the range of\n100 base-pairs (bp) [21], a value conserved in diverse taxo-\nnomic classes. The length distribution of 3' UTRs is much\nbroader, with a significant number of long sequences exceed-\ning 1 kilobase (kb). The similarity between the length distri-\nbutions observed for the collection presented here and those\nsequences stored in public databases suggests that most of\nour sequences are full-length cDNAs with correctly annotated\nstart codon positions.\nThe most remarkable feature noted in the analysis of 5' UTRs\nof the bursal cDNAs is a very high GC content (67%). This\nsupports the observation that the GC content of 5' UTRs is\nparticularly high in warm-blooded species [22]. On the other\nhand, the percentage of GC base-pairs in 3' UTRs of the bursal\ncDNAs (41%) is close to the value observed for database\nsequences (42%). The ORFs of the bursal full-length cDNAs\ncontain 49% GC base-pairs.\nAnalysis of start codon context\nThe accurate prediction of the translation start codon\nremains difficult and in some cases our annotations remain\ntentative. Sequences surrounding the translation start codons\nare not random and in mammals match the consensus\nGCCRCCaugG (where aug is the start codon and R is either A\nor G) [23]. The most conserved nucleotides in the consensus\nare a purine, usually A, at position-3 and G at position 4. It\nhas also been observed that a large fraction of 5' UTRs contain\nAUG codons upstream of the translation start site, but these\ncodons are unlikely to be flanked by the consensus sequence\n[21].\nA detailed analysis shows that the riken1 collection of cDNA\nsequences contains 4,406 AUG codons upstream of the anno-\ntated translation start codons in 2,218 of the bursal cDNAs.\nNine hundred one of these alternative start codons were in\nthe same reading frame as the annotated ORF. An in-frame\nstop codon within the 5' UTR region was present downstream\nof 501 of these 901 alternative start codons. The total number\nof ORFs present in 5' UTR regions of riken1 cDNAs was 1,289.\nWe have checked whether the context of the annotated AUG\nstart codons differs from the context of the alternative\nupstream AUG sequences of the bursal cDNAs. We therefore\nextracted 10-bp long sequences surrounding the annotated\nstart codons and the alternative upstream AUGs and visual-\nized sequence variability using the sequence logo software\n[24] (Figure 3). The annotated start codons closely match the\nconsensus, but the alternative upstream AUG codons do not\nexhibit flanking nucleotide preferences. This provides further\nevidence that the ORFs in our collection are correctly\nannotated.\nSimilarity to predicted Ensembl transcripts and \nUniProt protein sequences\nAll full-length cDNAs were compared to the collection of tran-\nscripts predicted from the chicken genome sequence by the\nEnsembl system [25]. The transcripts were downloaded\nbefore the Ensembl team used our collection of full-length\nbursal cDNA sequences to improve transcript predictions.\nDistribution of the percent identity and coverage of the best\nBLASTN alignments are shown in Figure 4a. Only 494 of the\nchicken full-length transcripts matched predicted mRNAs\nwith a length coverage greater than 90%. This is not surpris-\ning taking into account that computational prediction of\nuntranslated regions, based on the genome sequence alone, is\nvery difficult, if not impossible. However, there were also sig-\nnificant differences between sequenced and predicted cDNAs\nwithin ORF regions. There are 1,463 sequences in which\neither the 5' or the 3' end of the ORF was not covered by pre-\ndicted transcripts. In most cases (1,106), the discrepancy con-\ncerned the 5' end. The statistics presented above and\nsummarized in Table 1 indicate that our collection of full-\nlength cDNA sequences may be used to significantly improve\nthe annotations of more than 1,400 chicken genes. This anal-\nysis is further supported by the mapping of bursal serial anal-\nysis of gene expression (SAGE) tags to Ensembl transcripts\nand the genome sequence [26].\nFigure 4b shows the distribution of the percent identity and\ncoverage statistics of the BLASTP comparison of the proteins\nencoded by the bursal cDNAs to the UniProt collection of pro-\ntein sequences. In most cases (1,524), the proteins encoded by\nriken1 cDNAs were almost fully covered in the alignments\n(more than 90% coverage) and showed a high percentage\nidentity (greater than 70%) to known protein sequences.\nWhen compared to available chicken ESTs or cDNAs in the\npublic databases, some of the bursal cDNAs showed signifi-\ncant structural differences most likely due to differential tran-\nscript processing. In addition, the bursal cDNA collection hasGenome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nR6.4 Genome Biology 2004,     Volume 6, Issue 1, Article R6       Caldwell et al. http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6been used to define a large number of intragenic single-nucle-\notide polymorphisms (SNPs) [27].\nFunctional domain assignment\nAll full-length cDNAs were compared to the Pfam database\n[28], which stores sequence profiles representing functional\ndomains and the 10 most frequently occurring domains are\nshown in Table 2.

Experimental information concerning the molecu-\nlar mechanisms of action is very sparse or nonexistent for\nproteins sharing these evolutionarily conserved domains.\nHighly similar human proteins exist for the chicken proteins,\nan example being the human protein BM02. Taking into\naccount the ease of targeted genome modification and\navailability of numerous functional assays, the DT40 cell line\nis an attractive model system to provide first insights into the\nfunctions of the evolutionarily conserved domains described\nabove.\nBursal Transcript database\nAll the full-length cDNA sequences are stored within the Bur-\nsal Transcript database [18]. This database links the previ-\nously published EST data with the new cDNAs and can be\nsearched by keyword or by using BLAST. Browsing of func-\ntional categories is also available as dynamically generated\nweb pages link the bursal cDNAs to Ensembl, UniProt, Pfam\nand to GO data. To highlight gene expression differences\nbetween DT40 and bursal cells, the bursal cDNAs are also\nlinked to SAGE data from both of these types of cells [26].\nConclusions\nThe cDNAs from bursal lymphocytes represent one of the\nlargest full-length cDNA collections in the chicken, compris-\ning about one third of all currently available, experimentally\nverified transcripts and will be of general interest to research-\ners using the chicken as an experimental model as well as to\nthe poultry industry. The resource has already been\nintegrated with the chicken genome sequences to build a uni-\ngene catalog [9], to define the nature and frequency of intra-\ngenic chicken strain polymorphisms [27] and to develop a\nchicken gene microarray for gene-expression profiling (B.\nTable 2\nThe 10 most frequently occurring Pfam domains in chicken full-length cDNAs\nPfam ID Description Number of occurrences\nPF00069 Protein kinase domain 66\nPF00076 RRM_1: RNA recognition motif 46\nPF00071 Ras family 32\nPF00025 Arf: ADP-ribosylation factor family 23\nPF00169 PH: pleckstrin homology domain. 22\nPF00271 Helicase_C, Helicase conserved C-terminal domain 20\nPF00018 SH3 (Src homology 3) domain 18\nPF00651 BTB or POZ domain present in some of zinc finger proteins 18\nPF00270 DEAD, DEAD\/DEAH box helicase 18\nPF00004 AAA, ATPase family associated with various cellular activities 14\nTable 3\nThe 10 molecular function GO terms most frequently assigned to chicken cDNAs\nGO ID Description Number of occurrences*\nGO:0005524 ATP binding 166\nGO:0004672 Protein kinase activity 66\nGO:0003677 DNA binding 64\nGO:0005525 GTP binding 57\nGO:0005515 Protein binding 37\nGO:0016491 Oxidoreductase activity 27\nGO:0005554 Molecular function unknown 22\nGO:0003700 Transcription factor activity 19\nGO:0008565 Protein transporter activity 18\nGO:0008270 Zinc ion binding 17\n*Number of cDNAs containing domain annotated by the GO term.Genome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6 Genome Biology 2004,     Volume 6, Issue 1, Article R6       Caldwell et al.

However,\nthe main beneficiary of the full-length cDNAs is the DT40\nresearch community. Although the release of the genome\nsequence has greatly simplified the identification of candi-\ndate genes for disruption and the design of the knockout con-\nstructs, it is still not a trivial task to predict the ORFs as well\nas 3' and 5' UTRs without cDNA sequences. Other uses are the\nexpression of the cDNAs in vitro or for complementation of\nmutant DT40 phenotypes with the added convenience that\nthe cDNA sequences are not only known, but also available as\ncloned pieces of fully sequenced DNA.\nMaterials and methods\nConstruction of the riken1 cDNA library and 5' EST \nsequencing\nThe riken1 library was synthesized from mRNA of 2-week-old\nCB strain bursal lymphocytes using the biotinylated cap trap-\nper method [16,31]. The resulting phage library was con-\nverted into pKS-derived plasmids and individual clones were\nthen selected on ampicillin-containing agarose plates. About\n45,000 colonies were picked and transferred into 384-well\nmicrotiter plates to prepare a permanent clone stock. Plas-\nmids from 14,976 of the arrayed clones were sequenced on an\nApplied Biosystems automated sequencer using a primer that\nanneals to the plasmid backbone upstream of the 5' end of the\ncDNA inserts (see [18] for details of the cloning vector\nsequence). The ABI sequencing files were processed as\ndescribed previously [13]. About 5% of the riken1 clones con-\ntained an insert sequence which was 100% identical to the\nGenBank entry AJ277662, annotated as a human genomic\nfragment including the LMO1 locus. This sequence was\npresent as a stuffer of the lambda vector used for the library\nconstruction and the clones containing it were removed from\nfurther analysis. In total, the 5' single-pass sequencing of\n14,976 clones yielded 11,116 high-quality ESTs of the riken1\nlibrary.\nSelection of clones for full-length insert sequencing\nBLAST searches against the 'All non-redundant GenBank\nCDS' database showed that approximately 80% of the 5' EST\nsequences matched GenBank entries with a score of at least\n50. This score threshold was chosen because it allowed us in\nmost cases to align the putative start codon of the query\nsequence to the EST. These sequences were chosen and clus-\ntered [32] to remove duplicates. In addition, all sequences\nmatching chicken entries in the public databases with a score\nof over 300 were not considered further. The BLAST results\nof all remaining sequences were manually inspected and only\nthose sequences which covered the methionine start codon of\ntheir closest match in the public databases were retained. In\nthe end, the cDNA inserts corresponding to 2,796 ESTs were\nchosen for full insert sequencing.\nFull-length insert sequencing\nSufficient plasmid template for numerous sequencing reac-\ntions was prepared from the clones corresponding to the\nselected ESTs. All plasmids were then sequenced with a\nprimer complementary to a plasmid sequence 3' of the cDNA\ninsertion site. Subsequently, custom-made 20-mer primers\nbased on available sequences were used for sequencing until\nthe 3' and 5' ends of the cDNA inserts were reached. All\nsequences were processed as described previously [13],\nexcept that a routine of manual proofreading and editing of\nthe chromatograms within the Staden pregap program was\nimplemented to increase the quality of the base calling and to\ndecrease the failure rate of the next primer walk. The FOUN-\nTAIN software [32] was extended to automatically design\nprimers in 96-well format suitable for these walks. The prim-\ners were positioned to give an average of a 70-bp overlap\nTable 4\nThe 10 biological process GO terms most frequently assigned to chicken cDNAs\nGO ID Description Number of occurrences*\nGO:0006468 Protein amino acid phosphorylation 66\nGO:0006355 Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent 39\nGO:0006508 Proteolysis and peptidolysis 38\nGO:0007264 Small GTPase mediated signal transduction 33\nGO:0006412 Protein biosynthesis 29\nGO:0006118 Electron transport 28\nGO:0006886 Intracellular protein transport 26\nGO:0007165 Signal transduction 18\nGO:0005975 Carbohydrate metabolism 17\nGO:0006457 Protein folding 11\n*Number of cDNAs containing domain annotated by the GO term.Genome Biology 2004, 6:R6\nR6.8 Genome Biology 2004,     Volume 6, Issue 1, Article R6       Caldwell et al. http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2004\/6\/1\/R6between sequences. Once both ends of the insert were\nreached by the primer walks, the Staden gap4 program [33]\nwas used to produce a double-stranded consensus of the\ncDNA insert. A total of 2,565 high-quality cDNA contigs were\nassembled for further analysis.\nQuality check and correction of frameshifts in the \ncDNA sequences\nThe integrity of the conserved ORF within each assembled\ncDNA sequence was manually examined by inspecting BLAST\nsearch results against the public protein and EST databases.\nTo facilitate this task, a new EstSet module was added to\nFOUNTAIN [32]. The user interface displays the sequence of\nthe cDNA insert together with its three possible translations\nand its BLAST search results against the public protein and\nEST databases. On the basis of this information a likely\nmethionine start codon can be assigned to the cDNA. Around\n15% of the cDNA sequences showed evidence of an artificial\nframeshift in the form of suspicious BLAST matches in two or\nmore ORFs, presumably due to errors in the reverse tran-\nscription process. These sequences were compared to other\nGallus gallus ESTs from the public databases. If the short\nORF could be corrected by adopting the sequence of an over-\nlapping EST, the cDNA sequence was edited. The type of edit-\ning was recorded and the corresponding riken1 clone was\nannotated as likely to be defective. In total, 293 cDNAs were\nremoved because either a likely artificial frameshift could not\nbe corrected by using sequences of overlapping ESTs or they\ncontained multiple stop codons in all three reading frames or\nthey showed evidence for unspliced introns. All cDNA clones\nare freely available upon request to the corresponding author\nand their sequences have been submitted to the EMBL public\ndatabase (accession numbers AJ719267-AJ721138 and\nAJ851370-AJ851825).\nAnalysis of the start codon context\nThe sequences surrounding the annotated start codons (10 bp\nupstream and downstream) were exported and submitted for\ninformation content visualization by the WebLogo software\n[24]. Subsequently, we have exported the \u00b1 10 bp context of\nevery ATG codon located upstream of the annotated start of\nthe coding sequence. These sequences were also submitted to\nanalysis by WebLogo software.\nSequence-similarity searches and functional class \nannotation\nThe riken1 cDNAs were compared with the collection of pre-\ndicted chicken transcripts downloaded from the Ensembl ftp\nsite [34] using the BLASTN program. BLASTP software was\nused to compare translated ORFs with the protein sequences\nstored in the UniProt database. Functional domains were\nassigned by comparing riken1 cDNAs with sequence profiles\nrepresenting Pfam domains. This comparison was performed\nwith RPSBLAST software (e-value cut-off of 10-6) run on the\nbinary database files downloaded from the National Center\nfor Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Functional classes\nwere assigned according to Pfam to GO mapping provided by\nthe InterPro database. The XML information exchange stand-\nard was used to interface the BLAST program outputs with\nthe FOUNTAIN package.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the EU grants 'Chicken IMAGE', 'Genetics in\na cell line' (QLK3-2000-00785) and 'Mechanisms of gene integration'\n(LSHG-CT-2003-503303).\nReferences\n1.
