INTRODUCTION \nA recent effort of the cellular infrastructure enhancement is \ntowards \u201cBeyond 3G (B3G)\u201d, or \u201ccomposite radio\u201d (CR) [1]. \nThese concepts assume heterogeneous networks infrastructure \ncomprising different wireless access systems such as \nGSM\/GPRS, UMTS, DVB and WLAN. The study presented in \nthis paper considers the CR of MBMS and DVB-H networks as \nthe research target for \u201cB3G\u201d, due to their inherent \n\u201cone-to-many\u201d or multicast\/broadcast transmission capabilities, \nwhich have been regarded as resource efficient to deliver \nmultimedia services over bandwidth-limited wireless systems \n[2]. MBMS is a technique under investigation within the 3GPP \nframework as an enhancement to the current UMTS [3], while \nDVB-H a standard that is given additional features based on \ncurrent DVB to support IP-based broadcast services for \nhandheld portable and mobile terminals [4].  \nOne of the principle research challenges involved in \nheterogeneous networks is the network selection (NS) problem \nregarding determining the appropriate AN among composite \nANs when users are reachable through several ANs. Recently, \nthere are research efforts on addressing the NS problem for \n\u201cone-to-one\u201d or unicast service. [5] [6] [7] proposed a \nuser-centric mechanism in which every mobile user chooses the \nmost profitable AN according to the QoS profile, user \npreference, price model and network conditions. However, a \nnew problem emerges when multicast based \u201cone-to-many\u201d \nservices are introduced in heterogeneous networks. We term this \nnew problem as Network Selection for \u201cOne-to-Many\u201d Services \n(NS-OMS). In this context, the user-centric NS for unicast \nservices is not applicable for multicast services due to the \ndiverse preferences and requirements of users. Thus, our work \nexpands the earlier work by handing over the decision-making \nresponsibility from each user to the network that chooses the \nmost appropriate AN for the multicast service desired by a \ngroup of users. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first \nattempt to address the problem of NS-OMS. A fundamental \nalgorithm framework is first defined and proposed. Six schemes \nbased on this algorithm framework are then evaluated by \nsimulations. The implementation issues of the proposed \nalgorithm are addressed in [8] in terms of architecture, \nfunctional entities, network interfaces, signaling and associated \nparameters. The application to be considered in this NS-OMS \nproblem is the Group-based Mobile Multimedia-on-Demand \n(GMMoD) service, which is a real-time streaming service. \nGMMoD aims to stream low-cost multimedia services by \nsending one copy of data through one multicast channel to \nsubscribed mobile users. These users are referred to as a group \n[2]. \nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section II, \nour algorithm framework to solve the NS-OMS problem is \ndiscussed in detail. The simulation model and results obtained \nare demonstrated and analyzed in section III. Section IV \nconcludes the paper with directions for the future work. \nII. NS-OMS ALGORITHM FRAMEWORK \nAn algorithm framework is developed and proposed in this \npaper to solve the NS-OMS problem. It provides a solution in \nterms of essential functionalities, interfaces and procedure for \nnetwork operators or service providers to find out the \nappropriate AN for the required QoS guarantees of multicast \nservices. Fig. 1 illustrates the algorithm framework. This \nalgorithm framework consists of three main parts, namely, \nconstrains and goal, service scheduling and resource \nallocation.

NS-OMS Algorithm Framework \nEach part involved in the NS-OMS algorithm framework is \ndescribed in depth below. \nA. Constrains and goal: \nThis paper considers wireless resources in the downlink as \nconstrains due to the following reasons. Firstly, the scarce \nwireless resource is the major obstacle to the cost effective \nprovisioning of high bandwidth multimedia services in wireless \nnetworks. Secondly, the wireless multimedia service envisions \nasymmetric transmission with more resource required in \ndownlink than in uplink. Finally, the property of GMMoD \napplication does not allow the control function during an \napplication transmission, such as, pause, rewind etc., which \nalleviates the resource stress further in the uplink.  \nMBMS has WCDMA as the air interface in which the total \ntransmission power of the downlink is shared among all the \nusers. In order to maintain a stable and efficient system, the \ndownlink operation is usually controlled through the \ntransmission power rather than through the cell load factor, as in \nthe uplink. Therefore, the total transmission power in a Node B \nof UMTS network needs to be constrained below an available \nbut finite transmission power budget before allocating resource \nto a new session. The power constrain is given below [9]: \nthresholdsoldtotal PPP <\u2206+_   (1) \nwhere, Ptotal_old is the total downlink transmission power \nbefore the admittance of the new session s and is the aggregation \nof the downlink transmission power required by each active \nconnection; Pthreshold is the volume of the maximum available \ntransmit power adjustable by network operators; \u2206Ps is the \nestimated transmission power required by the new session s. \nMBMS does not use the fast power control mechanism that \napplies to determine the transmission power for each active \nreceiver in UMTS. Instead, the proportion of the available Node \nB power allocated to a particular session with a certain \nbandwidth requirement will essentially be fixed to cover certain \ncoverage. \nIn DVB-H, IP datagrams are encapsulated into the \nmultiprotocol encapsulation (MPE) section and then \nmultiplexed with TV data in a DVB national\/regional multiplex \n(MUX) [4]. The admittance of a new IP session mainly depends \non the size of the residual space available after reserving enough \nspace for TV data in the MUX. Therefore, similar to the power \nconstraint in MBMS, in DVB-H, the resource can be allocated \nto the new IP session only if the maximum available bandwidth \nbudget is not exceeded, i.e.,  \nthresholdsoldtotal BBB <\u2206+_     )( ss RB =\u2206                 (2) \nwhere, Btotal_old is the volume of the total occupied bandwidth \nby IP active sessions before the admittance of the new session s; \n\u2206Bs is the bandwidth of the new session s and is estimated by its \ninformation rate Rs (i.e., the guaranteed bit rate) according to its \nQoS level; Bthreshold is the volume of the maximum available \ntransmission bandwidth adjustable by network operators and \nshould be configured by taking the space of the reserved \nresource for TV data into account.  \nThe goal of NS-OMS algorithm is to select the most \nappropriate service set-up time and AN for each user\u2019s GMMoD \ncontent request so that user\u2019s QoS requirement, in particularly \nthe bandwidth, is satisfied and resources constrains are met \nwhile maximizing the System Profit (SP). SP is the difference \nbetween the revenue earned in serving users and the resource \ncost consumed in transmitting services. By assuming the \nvolume-based charging model, SP is derived as follows: \n\u2211\u2211\u2211\n= = =\n\u2212=\nK\nk\nN\ni\nM\nj k\nkij\nkijiii C\nr\nnwdbSP\n1 1 1\n)(                           (3) \nwhere, K is the number of inter-worked networks; N is the \nnumber of provided contents in a network; M is the number of \nestablished groups for a content in a network; b is the content \nbandwidth and d is the content duration; w is revenue per bit for \na content earned from a group; n is the group size in the number \nof requests; r\/C is the resource cost per bit for a group, where r is \nthe amount of resources consumed by a group and C is the \namount of available resources in a network. Note that the \nresource units to be considered are different in various networks, \ni.e., power for MBMS and bit rate for DVB-H.  \nB. Service scheduling \nService Scheduling involves the following four steps: \n1) Batching:  Batch or aggregate multiple users\u2019 requests \nfor the same content in a batching queue before the service \nset-up. In the batching, a user could leave from the batching \nqueue due to the lack of the patience to wait, which is referred \nto as reneging [10]. Users in each batching queue are treated as \na specific group requiring a particular content. The requests in \none group are to be served simultaneously over a multicast \nchannel in order to save wireless resources. More detailed \ndiscussion regarding baching can be found in [2]. \n2) Queue Idenitification: Identify and mark queues for the \nresource allocation where the reneging has happened. This step \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 20,2010 at 08:11:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nis triggered  by a user just about to leave. Note that if this user \ncan not be served in the resource allocation procedure due to the \nlack of resouces, this user reneges and is lost, otherwise, this \nuser along with the other users in this queue is served.  \n3) Queue Prioritization: Sort all marked queues identified \nin step 2 in descending order depending on certain proprity \ncreteria. The higher order corresponds to the higher priority to \nbe considered for the resource allocation. Two creteria are \nconsidered in this paper: \na)  First Come First Serve (FCFS): Queues are sorted \naccording to tc-t1, where tc is the current time at the scheduling \npoint and t1is the arrival time of the first user staying in the \nqueue. \nb) Maximum Queue Length (MQL):  Queues are sorted \naccording to n, where n is the number of users staying in the \nqueue. \n4) Queue Selection: select one queue from all identified \nqueues, at a time, in the order made in step 3; \nC. Resource allocation \nResource allocation involves the following two steps: \n1) Network Selection: select and assign an appropriate AN \nto the queue chosen in step of Queue Selection, according to a \ncertain policy. The selected AN is used to transmit the content \nrequested. Three policies are examined in this paper: \na) Fixed  AN assigment (FANA): Assign users to the only \nAN that provides the content required. This AN is refered to as  \nan originating network. The other potential ANs are referred to \nas cooperating networks. If there is no enough resource to \nsatisfy the bandwidth requirement in the originating network, \nusers\u2019 requests are batched in the queue until they renege or free \nresources are released;  \nb) Retry-based AN assignment (RANA): First, assign \nusers to their originating networks. The cooperating network \nwill be tried to set up the connection whenver there is no \nenough resource available in the originating network; \nc) Objective-based AN assignment (OANA): Each AN is \ntreated equally.  The chosen AN is that gives the hightest SP for \nthe content desired, which is calculated based on equation (3).  \n2) Repeating: repeat the step of queue selection and in turn \nresource allocation for the chosen queue to accomondate as \nmany queues as possible into networks. \nIII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION \nSix schemes (based on two Queue Prioritization criteria, \nthree Network Selection policies) have been evaluated to \ninvestigate the proposed algorithm framework for the NS-OMS \nproblem by a simulator constructed by OPNET [11]. \nHeterogeneous networks containing MBMS with seven cells \nand DVB-H with one cell are constructed, both cover one \nservice area A. Two service classes are assumed. Each service \nclass is characterized by operator, request arrival rate, mean \nduration and bandwidth. Each class includes five different \ncontents. The duration of content is given by a random variable, \nwhich is determined by an Exponential distribution and is \nupdated every one hour. For schemes evaluated in this paper, the \nrevenue per bit of each content is set to 0.004 in order to give a \npositive SP and for simplification to present schemes. Requests \nfor each service class is generated with Poisson distribution, and \nfor each service class request, the probability of choosing a \nspecific content of this service class is given by the Zipf \ndistribution [12], i.e., the probability of choosing the kth content \nis given by: \n)1( \u03b8\u2212= k\ncpk                                      (4) \n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\nM\nk k\nc\n1\n)1(\n11 \u03b8                                  (5) \nwhere, c is a normalization constant; M is the number of \ncontents provided by a service class; \u03b8 is the parameter that \ndetermines the shape of the distribution. A small \u03b8 corresponds \nto a more severe discrimination of requests among contents and \nindicates that some contents are desired more frequently than \nthe others. As in [13], \u03b8=0.271 is used. \nA deterministic reneging model is used [10]. In this model, \nafter waiting a certain period of time given by the waiting \nthreshold w, the user\u2019s remaining time until departure is given \nby the random variable R, which is determined by an \nExponential distribution with a mean waiting time u that elapses \nafter w until the user leaves the system.  Thus the user\u2019s overall \nwait time is given by W=w+R(u). \nA fluid flow mobility model is adopted [14]. In this model, \nthe mobile terminals are uniformly distributed over a given cell. \nMobile terminal have a mean velocity of V and their direction of \nmovements are uniformly distributed over [0, 2\u03c0]. The residing \ntime of a mobile within a cell is exponentially distributed and \nthe mean dwell time can be estimated by \u03b71 , where  \u03b7 is the \ncell crossover rate. The crossover rate for the circular cell of \nradius r is given by: \nr\nV\n\u03c0\n\u03b7 2=                                           (6) \nSimulation parameters used in this study are listed in Table 1 \nand Table 2. \nTABLE I.

Satisfactory ratio versus waiting threshold \nWhen the waiting threshold increases, all schemes give \nhigher SP and satisfactory ratio because longer waiting \nthreshold corresponds to the higher possibility of users waiting \nfor the content set-up without reneging, which in turn reduces \nthe request arrival rate for the resource allocation, thereby \nreleasing more free resources. Of all the schemes, OANA and \nRANA tend to obtain the performance achievable by satisfying \nall the users, i.e., 100% satisfactory ratio in maximum. On the \ncontrary, the separated resource usage in FANA prevents it from \nreaching the maximum performance. \nFurthermore, it can be seen that the MQL prioritization \ncriterion gives more SP and higher satisfactory ratio than the \nFCFS prioritization criterion with the same network selection \npolicy. This is because MQL is able to schedule more number of \nusers into one multicast channel, which increases the resource \nutilization. \nIn addition, under the same queue prioritization criteria, \nOANA and RANA give similar satisfactory ratios, which are \nhigher than FANA. This is because both RANA and OANA are \nable to redirect traffic into cooperating ANs whenever there are \nno enough resources, ensuring that resources are utilized fully \nand efficiently. On the contrary, FANA policy only uses \nresources in the originating network for the content desired, \nwhich results in an unbalanced network status, i.e., overloading \nin a network, whereas underloading in the other. Moreover, in \nterms of SP, OANA obtains better performance over other \nnetwork selection policies because OANA always transmits the \ntraffic through the network that gives the higher profit.   \nIn general, from results displayed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it can \nbe concluded that MQL+OANA is the optimum scheme in \nterms of SP. To further assess the performance of schemes \nconsidered, in particular the impact of different Queue \nPrioritization Criteria, we look at another important \nperformance metric, i.e., system unfairness. The degree of the \nsystem unfairness is defined by the variance of the satisfactory \nratio of the contents, which is in turn divided by the total \nnumber of contents provided in the system, i.e., \nM\nSRSR\nirnessSystemUnfa\nM\nk\nk\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n1\n2)(\n                     (7) \nwhere, SRk is the satisfactory ratio for a content k and M is \nthe total number of contents provided by the system. Clearly, the \nsystem unfairness increases when there is a discrimination of \nrequests among contents corresponding to the variety of content \npopularities. \n0\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12\n0.16\n0.2\n0.24\n3 4 5 6 7\nWaiting Threshold (min)\nSy\nst\nem\n U\nnf\nai\nrn\nes\ns\nMQL+OANA\nFCFS+OANA\nMQL+RANA\nFCFS+RANA\nMQL+FANA\nFCFS+FANA\n \nFigure 4.  System unfairness versus waiting threshold \nFig. 4 presents the system unfairness for varying the waiting \nthreshold. It can be seen that the FCFS queue prioritization \ncriterion gives lower system unfairness than the MQL with the \nsame network selection policy. This confirms the fairness \ncapability of FCFS because FCFS treats each content equally \nregardless of its popularity. In addition, the FANA network \nselection policy gives the higher system unfairness over the \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MQL can increase the \nnumber of satisfied users by always scheduling the longest \nqueue, whereas, OANA can help to increase the system profit \nfor each selected queue by assigning the queue to the most \nprofitable access network. However, the high SP gained by \nMQL+OANA is at the price of the high system unfairness that \ncan be improved by using FCFS+OANA. This result indicates \nthat the optimum scheme varies with various goals \ncorresponding to different requirements of particular network \noperators and service providers. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS \nAs mobile communications is enhanced towards \u201ccomposite \nradio\u201d, multicast transmission is attracting more and more \nattention because it offers a more cost-effective provisioning of \nmultimedia services. This paper proposed, for the first time, an \nalgorithm framework to solve the problem of the network \nselection for the multicast traffic, which is termed as Network \nSelection for \u201cOne-to-Many\u201d Services (NS-OMS) problem, by \nstudying the scenario of MBMS and DVB-H cooperative \nnetworks. The goal is to satisfy users\u2019 QoS requirements of the \ncontent desired, while maximizing the system profit. This \nalgorithm framework provides functionalities, interfaces and \nprocedure to solve the NS-OMA problem. The flexibility of this \nalgorithm framework enables future enhancements. Six \nschemes based on the algorithm framework have been \ndeveloped and evaluated by simulation. The results show that \nthe MQL+OANA scheme obtains better performances than \nother schemes in terms of the system profit.  \nIn terms of future work, we plan to investigate more \nschemes based on the algorithm framework by considering \ndifferent optimization objectives and to find out the most \nappropriate scheme in different environments. We also plan to \nenhance our algorithm framework by considering the adaptive \nQoS to the time-varying network conditions and resource \navailability. \nV.
