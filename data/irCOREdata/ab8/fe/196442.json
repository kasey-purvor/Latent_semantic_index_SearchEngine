This pulse force has a broad frequency\nband, which will include the high natural vibration fre-\nquency of the bearing system. Modulation of impact\nfrequency to natural vibration frequency occurs.\nCurrently, envelope demodulation following band-\npass filtering of the vibration signal is the most effec-\ntive approach for diagnosis in bearings. By selecting\na frequency band covering the high frequency reso-\nnance spectral peak, the fault characteristic frequen-\ncies can be identified. A band-pass filter is normally\nused in all such traditional envelope demodulation\n\u2217Corresponding author: Department of Engineering, University\nof Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK. email:\njat7@le.ac.uk\nmethods and careful filter design is important to avoid\nsignal distortion [1].\nMuch work has been done in the spectrum analysis\nof vibration signals for monitoring rotating machinery\nsuch as rotary pumps, turbomolecular pumps, pis-\nton pumps, screw compressors, turbines, and motors,\nbut very little has been done in the area of oil-free\ndry vacuum pumps [2]. However, the study of this\nkind of pump is important to industry because nowa-\ndays the dry vacuum pump is the common choice\nfor clean room applications for integrated circuit\nsemiconductor manufacturing. In metal etching and\nlow-pressure chemical vapour deposition processes,\nchemical corrosive vapours are abundant. There are\nthus large amounts of residual particulates, and resul-\ntant pump failures must be avoided to prevent sub-\nstantial financial losses due to the wafer costs involved.\nFor these reasons, continuous real-time monitoring\nof dry vacuum pumps is desirable to reduce machine\nunscheduled downtime and maintenance costs.\nIn the current paper, a Morlet-like wavelet cluster-\nbased method for band-pass filtering and envelope\ndemodulation is proposed. By appropriate choice\nJMES544 \u00a9 IMechE 2007 Proc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part C: J. Mechanical Engineering Science\n1280 W Jiang, S K Spurgeon, J ATwiddle, F S Schlindwein,Y Feng, and SThanagasundram\nof wavelet parameters, the cluster combined with\nmulti-Morlet-like wavelets can be used as a band-pass\nfilter with zero phase shift, flat topped pass-band, and\nfast attenuation in the transition band. It can be used\nto extract high frequency natural vibration compo-\nnents. The imaginary part of the Morlet-like wavelet\ncluster is the Hilbert transformation of its real part.\nSo the result of convolution of the sampled vibration\nsignal with the wavelet cluster is the analytical signal.\nThe square root of the quadratic sum of the real part\nand the imaginary part of the convolution result can\nrealize the envelope demodulation.\nThe method is applied to fault diagnosis in a five-\nstage Roots and Claw mechanism dry vacuum pump.\nThe fault characteristic frequencies are extracted effec-\ntively. The feasibility of the method is thus validated\nby experiment. In section 2, the characteristics of the\nMorlet-like wavelet cluster are introduced. The enve-\nlope demodulation approach is described in section 3.\nSection 4 presents the bearing fault detection problem\nand associated results.\n2 MORLET-LIKEWAVELET CLUSTER AND\nBAND-PASS FILTER\n2.1 Single wavelet\nA single Morlet-like wavelet has the following mathe-\nmatical representation\nh(t) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0a\nexp\n(\n\u2212 t\n2\n2a2\n)\nexp( j2\u03c0 f0t)\n= 1\u221a\n2\u03c0a\nexp\n(\n\u2212 t\n2\n2a2\n)\n[cos(2\u03c0 f0t)+ j sin(2\u03c0 f0t)]\n(1)\nwith corresponding Fourier transformation\nH ( f ) = exp\n(\n\u2212a\n2[2\u03c0( f \u2212 f0)]2\n2\n)\n(2)\nwhere a is a scalar parameter and f0 is the central\nfrequency. Equation (1) describes a single Morlet-like\nwavelet consisting of real part hre(t) and imaginary\npart him(t). Equation (2) shows its spectrum is a\nbell-shaped Gaussian density function with central\nfrequency f0. By changing the parameter a, the height\nand width of the bell-shaped curve will be altered.\nFor specific parameters a = 0.2 and f0 = 5, the time\ndomain waveform and spectrum curve are shown in\nFigs 1 and 2, respectively.\nIn fact, a single Morlet-like wavelet is a narrow band-\npass filter with zero phase shift. It has high quality\nfiltering characteristics. Through changing the param-\netera, the bandwidth and attenuation of the transition\nzone can be altered. The filtered frequency band can\nbe changed by adjusting the central frequency f0.\nFig. 1 Time domain waveform of a single Morlet-like\nwavelet\nFig. 2 Spectrum of a single Morlet-like wavelet\n2.2 Wavelet cluster\nA wavelet cluster is formed by combining N + 1 single\nwavelets with differing central frequencies [3]. In this\nway a broad band-pass filter is constructed\nhc(t) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0a\nexp\n(\n\u2212 t\n2\n2a2\n)\n{exp[ j2\u03c0 fLt]\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + exp[ j2\u03c0( fL + k\u0003f )t]\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + exp[ j2\u03c0 fHt]}\nk = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,N , fH = fL +N\u0003f (3)\nwhere fL and fH are, respectively, the lower and upper\nfrequencies of the pass band, \u0003f is the distance\nbetween the central frequencies of adjacent single\nwavelets. Through selecting suitablea and \u0003f , a super-\nposition spectrum providing good frequency charac-\nteristics such as flat pass-band and fast-attenuated\ntransition band, can be obtained.\nWhen a = 0.2, N = 10, fL = 10 Hz, and \u0003f = 2 Hz,\nthen fH = 30 Hz. The spectrum of the wavelet cluster is\nProc. IMechE Vol. 221 Part C: J. Mechanical Engineering Science JMES544 \u00a9 IMechE 2007\nAwavelet cluster-based band-pass filtering and envelope demodulation approach 1281\nshown in Fig. 3. The cluster spectrum is not flat topped.\nWhena = 0.2,N = 10, fL = 10 Hz, and \u0003f = 1 Hz, then\nfH = 20 Hz, and the spectrum of the wavelet cluster\nis shown in Fig. 4. In this situation, the cluster has a\nflat-topped pass-band.\n2.3 Band-pass filter\nConvolution of the measured vibration signal with the\nwavelet cluster is given by\nsb(t) = s(t) \u00d7 hc(t) (4)\nwhere sb(t) is the component in the pass band fL \u223c fH\nof the original signal s(t).\nThe use of the wavelet cluster as a band-pass filter\nhas many merits. Its design and adjustment is conve-\nnient and straightforward. Depending on the actual\nrequirements, selecting suitable fL and fH, defines\nthe frequency band to be analysed and, by adjust-\ning a and \u0003f , appropriate filter characteristics can\nFig. 3 Superposition spectrum (note that the pass band\nis not flat)\nFig. 4 Superposition spectrum with flat-topped pass\nband\nbe obtained. The carefully designed wavelet cluster-\nbased band-pass filter has zero phase shift, a flat\ntopped pass-band and fast attenuation in the tran-\nsition band. The signal distortion due to non-linear\nphase of traditional infinite impulse response (IIR)\nfilters can be avoided by using the wavelet clus-\nter approach. Although zero phase shift can also be\nobtained using an finite impulse response (FIR) fil-\nter, narrow transition bands require a large number of\ncoefficients for an FIR-based approach; furthermore,\nthe use of the wavelet cluster as a digital filter pro-\nduces the analytical signal and performs the envelope\ndemodulation in one single step.\n3 ENVELOPEDEMODULATION\n3.1 Hilbert transformation\nFor a continuous time signal x(t), its Hilbert transfor-\nmation x\u02c6(t) is defined as [4]\nx\u02c6(t) = x(t) \u00d7 1\n\u03c0t\n(5)\nx\u02c6(t) can be thought of as the output of a filter hav-\ning unit impulse response hht(t) = 1\/\u03c0t and x(t) is the\ninput. The frequency response function of the Hilbert\ntransformation is\nHht( jf ) = \u2212j sign( f ) =\n{\n\u2212j, f > 0\nj, f < 0\n(6)\nDenoting Hht( jf ) = |Hht( jf )|ej\u03d5ht( f ), then\n|Hht( jf )| = 1 (7)\n\u03d5ht( f ) =\n{\n\u2212\u03c0\/2, f > 0\n\u03c0\/2, f < 0\n(8)\nFrom the equations above, the Hilbert transforma-\ntion is an all-pass filter with a frequency response\ncharacteristic of amplitude one. When a signal passes\nthrough the Hilbert transformation, its negative fre-\nquency components get a phase shift of 90\u25e6, and its\npositive frequency components get a phase shift of\n\u221290\u25e6.\n3.2 Orthogonality of wavelet cluster\nAccording to equation (3), the real part of the wavelet\ncluster hc(t) is\nhcre(t) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0a\nexp\n(\n\u2212 t\n2\n2a2\n)\n[cos(2\u03c0 fLt)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cos(2\u03c0 fkt) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cos(2\u03c0 fHt)] (9)\nwhere fk = fL + k\u0003f .\nJMES544 \u00a9 IMechE 2007 Proc.

Specifically hcre(t) and hcim(t) are mutually\northogonal.\nFrom equation (4)\nsb(t) = s(t) \u00d7 hc(t) = s(t) \u00d7 hcre(t) + js(t) \u00d7 hcim(t)\n= sbre(t) + jsbim(t) (14)\nThe Fourier transformation of equation (14) is\nSb( f ) = S( f )Hc( f ) = S( f )Hcre( f ) + jS( f )Hcim( f )\n= Sbre( f ) + jSbim( f ) (15)\nwhere\nSbre( f ) = S( f )Hcre( f ) (16)\nSbim( f ) = S( f )Hcim( f ) (17)\nReferring to equation (13), it can be obtained that\nSbim( f ) = \u2212j sign( f )Sbre( f ) (18)\nThis means sbim(t) is the Hilbert transformation\nof sbre(t), so that sbre(t) and sbim(t) are mutually\northogonal.\nIt follows that the imaginary part of the convolu-\ntion between the measured vibration signal and the\nwavelet cluster is the Hilbert transformation of its real\npart. Therefore, sb(t) is the complex \u2018analytic signal\u2019.\nThe envelope component of the bandpass-filtered\nsignal can be obtained by demodulation\nsben(t) =\n\u221a\n[sbre(t)]2 + [sbim(t)]2 (19)\nwhere sben(t) is the envelope demodulated signal.\nIf faults are present the fault characteristic frequen-\ncies can be distinguished by analysing the power\nspectral density of sben(t) [4].\nAccording to the analysis above, the convolution cal-\nculation can realize the Hilbert transformation. Two\nprocesses of band-pass filtering and Hilbert trans-\nformation in the traditional envelope demodulation\nmethods are combined in the convolution process in\nthis approach.\n4 ENGINEERING APPLICATION\n4.1 Dry vacuum pumps\nThe aim of this study is to apply the wavelet cluster-\nbased approach to diagnosis of a faulty bearing\ninstalled on a dry vacuum pump. The dry pump used\nin this experiment has a five-stage Roots and Claw\ndesign. The pump has one stage of two-lobed rotors\nnear the high vacuum end and four stages of claws\nnear the low vacuum end. The outlet port of the pump\nis located at the low vacuum end. Each rotor of the\npump has a single row of deep groove ceramic bearings\nat both the low and high vacuum ends. The tempera-\nture of the pump is regulated by an external coolant\nwater supply that prevents the pump from overheat-\ning. An inverter is used to control the speed of the\npump and for this experiment the speed of the motor\nwas fixed at 103 Hz. A diagram of the dry vacuum pump\nis presented in Fig. 5 showing the vibration trans-\nducer mounting points close to the bearings at both\nthe high vacuum end and the low vacuum end of the\npump.\n4.2 Prediction of bearing defect frequencies\nConsideration of the bearing design, geometry, and\nrotational speed allows prediction of signature defect\nfrequencies for a number of bearing faults, e.g. [5].\nFor the test pump used in the experiments the bear-\ning parameters (nine balls, diameter 9.525 mm, pitch\ndiameter 46.2 mm, and contact angle 24.97\u25e6) predict\ndefect frequencies as follows.\nProc.

They are denoted in the results as ADXL-HV and\nBK-HV, respectively. Another ADXL105 accelerome-\nter was mounted on the dry vacuum pump near\nthe low vacuum end. It is denoted by ADXL-LV. The\nmounted positions of the transducers are shown\nin Fig. 5.\nThe ADXL105 accelerometer is a second-generation\nsurface micro-machined device that carries a differ-\nential capacitive sensor and electronic signal condi-\ntioning circuitry on a single integrated chip [6]. The\nsignals from the ADXL105 were filtered with a low\npass anti-aliasing filter that was custom built in the\nlaboratory. The filter has an eighth order elliptic low-\npass characteristic with a cut-off frequency of 10 kHz.\nA relatively high order was implemented, as it was\ndesired to have a steep cut-off rate at 10 kHz and\nan attenuation of at least 70 dB in the stop band.\nThough the elliptic filter has a non-linear phase and\nhence a not-flat group delay, the phase characteris-\ntics of the signal are not important in this study and\nonly the amplitude level of the vibration signal is of\ninterest.\nThe signals from the Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r 4370V\naccelerometer were conditioned using a Br\u00fcel and\nKj\u00e6r 2692 preamplifier which converted the signal\nfrom charge to voltage form, changed its gain and\napplied a band-pass filter from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz hav-\ning 40 dB\/decade attenuation slope at upper limiting\nfrequency and lower limiting frequency.\nThe vibration signals were digitized using a 16-bit\nNational Instruments NI6034E card at a sampling\nrate of 40 kHz. They were suitably amplified by the\non-board gain amplifier on the ADC card before the\nA\/D conversion took place to make full use of the\navailable dynamic range.\n4.4 Constructing the wavelet cluster\nFigure 6 shows the power spectral density of sampled\nvibration signals from accelerometer BK-HV. A high\nfrequency resonance peak appears at about 6 kHz.\nThe desired pass-band of the filter is seen to be from\n5 to 7 kHz.\nThe wavelet cluster-based flat-topping band-pass\nfilter is constructed with a = 0.2, N = 2000, fL =\n5000 Hz, \u0003f = 1 Hz, and then fH = 7000 Hz. The spec-\ntrum of the wavelet cluster is shown in Fig. 7. It has a\nsteep cut-off frequency and flat-topped pass-band.\n4.5 Analysis process\nBlock diagram of the wavelet cluster-based vibration\nsignal-processing scheme is shown in Fig. 8.\nThe vibration signals are sampled at a rate of 40 kHz\nfrom the accelerometers. The convolution between\nthe original vibration signal and the wavelet clus-\nter constructed in section 4.4 is performed. Through\nthe convolution, the original vibration signal is both\nband-pass-filtered and the Hilbert transformation is\nimplemented. Therefore, a complex analytical signal\nis attained with a frequency range of 5\u20137 kHz. The\ndemodulation is realized by calculating the modulus\nof the complex analytical signal. The envelope signal is\nobtained by a tenth-order elliptical low-pass filter with\na cut-off frequency of 1 kHz and attenuation of 60 dB in\nthe transition band. The data was then down-sampled\nto 2 kHz as it was known that the frequencies of interest\nlie in the range of 0\u20131000 Hz. After down-sampling the\nenvelope signal, its mean value is removed by means\nof a sixth order high-pass elliptical filter with cut-off\nFig. 6 Power spectral density of original vibration signal\nJMES544 \u00a9 IMechE 2007 Proc.

Previous stud-\nies [7] concluded that a model order for the pump is\ndependent on the number of samples per revolution.\nAt 20 samples per revolution the minimum order is 20\nand little or no performance improvements were seen\nfor orders greater than 60. A 60th order model is chosen\nhere to provide sufficient resolution for the enveloped\nsignal.\n4.6 Results and diagnosis\nFigures 9(a) to (c) show the results obtained via\nthe processing methodology above for vibration sig-\nnals from transducer ADXL-LV, ADXL-HV, and BK-HV,\nrespectively. In these figures, the solid curves are the\nresults with an inlet pressure 20 mbar in a pump with\nfaulty bearings.

When calculating the power\nspectral density, 3072 data points were used.\nIn Fig. 9, the dotted curves show significant peaks\nin the fault-free spectra at the shaft rotating frequency\n103 Hz and its higher-order harmonics.\nThe actual bearing fault condition analysed during\nthe study was a group of indentations on the inner\nand outer race. A total of eight shallow indentations of\napproximately 1 mm2 (Fig. 10) were seeded around the\nrims of both the inner and outer races of the bearing.\nIn practice such indentations could be caused by the\ningress of soft foreign particles or pitting by aggressive\nmedia, for example refer [8]. According to section 4.2\nthese would cause signature frequency components at\n550 and 377 Hz, respectively.\nEach of the fault data spectra in Figs 9(a) to (c)\ncontains a significant peak at or close to 550 Hz\nconfirming the presence of the fault condition. In\naddition to the 550 Hz peaks, Fig. 9(a), the ADXL-LV\nfault spectra, shows significant peaks close to 42 Hz\n(cage frequency), 482 Hz (ball pass frequency), and\n550 Hz (inner race frequency). This suggests that if a\nfault occurs in one bearing component, mechanical\nFig. 10 An indentation in the rim of the bearing\ninner race\ncontact may cause vibration in other components. In\nFig. 9(b), the ADXL-HV fault spectra also show sig-\nnificant peaks close to 42 Hz (cage frequency), and in\nFig. 9(c) a peak at approximately 144 Hz is visible which\nis not explained by a known defect frequency.\nThe fault detection scheme is sensitive to even the\nsmall indentations tested here that represent a low\nJMES544 \u00a9 IMechE 2007 Proc.

However, further work is required to determine\nwhether it is possible to identify which bearing is\ncarrying the fault condition.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nA single Morlet-like wavelet can be used as a narrow\nband-pass filter. A Morlet-like wavelet cluster con-\nvolution can achieve band-pass filtering and Hilbert\ntransformation simultaneously. The analysis process\ninvolved in traditional envelope demodulation is\nsimplified.\nThe wavelet cluster-based band-pass filter has a zero\nphase-shift characteristic, avoiding the phase distor-\ntion of traditional filters. Through selecting suitable a\nand \u0003f , a superposition spectrum with the required\nfrequency characteristics of a flat pass band and\nrapidly attenuated transition band, can be obtained.\nThe wavelet cluster-based filtering and demodula-\ntion approach can be applied for fault diagnosis in\na dry vacuum pump. Experimental results show the\neffectiveness of the method in fault diagnosis.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is supported financially by the Doctoral\nFund of China Hebei Province under project num-\nber B2004128 and EPSRC grant GR\/S42866\/01.
