Advantages of this\nmethod are a reduction in B channeling and an increase in B\nelectrical activation due to the solid-phase-epitaxial \u0001SPE\u0002\nregrowth process.2\nSPE regrowth of the amorphized silicon does not remove\ninterstitial defects located at depths greater than the initial\namorphous\/crystalline \u0001a \/c\u0002 interface. Excess interstitial at-\noms in this region agglomerate into \u201cend-of-range\u201d \u0001EOR\u0002\ndefects situated just below the former a \/c interface. During\nhigher temperature annealing these defects undergo a series\nof transitions from self-interstitial clusters to \u0005113\u0006 defects to\ndislocation loops depending on the initial PAI and subse-\nquent conditions.3 These defects dissolve during annealing\nand the silicon self-interstitials so released migrate to nearby\nsinks such as the silicon surface.3 Transient enhanced diffu-\nsion and B electrical deactivation result from the interstitials\nthat diffuse towards the silicon surface during annealing.3,4\nIn the absence of sinks within the silicon, all of the released\ninterstitials diffuse towards the surface. Thus they either end\nup reacting with B atoms in the implant or migrating un-\nscathed through the B-doped layer to the silicon surface\u2014the\nformer being the more probable event in the case of high-\ndose B implants.\na\u0002Electronic mail: j.hamilton@eim.surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/89\u00024\u0001\/042111\/3\/$23.00 89, 04211\nownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toOne possible method to reduce the number of intersti-\ntials that migrate to the B implanted region is to provide an\nefficient alternative sink for the interstitials. In this letter we\ninvestigate whether the buried oxide interface of the silicon\ntop layer in silicon on insulator \u0001SOI\u0002 may function in this\nway. This question is of considerable importance as SOI\nemerges as a candidate technology for future CMOS\napplications.5\nExperiments were performed on n-type \u0007100\b Czochral-\nski silicon wafers with a resistivity of \t10\u201325 \u0001 cm and on\nSOI wafers with a 145-nm-thick buried oxide and a\n55-nm-thick p-type Si overlayer. Silicon and Soitec\u00a9 SOI\nwafers were implanted with Ge+ at energies of 8 and 20 keV\nto a dose of 1\u00021015 Ge cm\u22122, amorphizing the silicon to\ndepths of \t20 and \t40 nm, respectively.6 The crystalline\nregion remaining below the a \/c interface was thus approxi-\nmately 35 nm thick in the 8 keV case and 15 nm thick in the\n20 keV case\u2014enough to create a strong difference in the\ndistance between the EOR defects and the buried oxide,\nwithout trapping a significant fraction of the implantation\ndamage in the oxide. The implants were performed using an\nApplied Materials Quantum III high-current implanter, with\nan implant orientation of 0\u00b0 tilt and 0\u00b0 twist. Boron was\nsubsequently implanted at an energy of 500 eV to a dose of\n2\u00021015 B cm\u22122.\nTo study the electrical \u0001de\u0002activation of the boron, iso-\nchronal annealing \u000160 s\u0002 was carried out using a Process\nProducts Corporation 18 Lamp rapid thermal processing an-\nnealer over a temperature range of 700\u20131000 \u00b0C.

Oxygen flooding\nand stage rotation were used during the analyses in order to\navoid ripple formation.7 The presence and structure of ex-\ntended defects were investigated by cross-sectional transmis-\nsion electron microscopy \u0001XTEM\u0002 observations in weak\nbeam \u0001WB\u0002 mode using a FEI Tecnai F20 electron micro-\nscope operating at 200 kV.\nFigure 1 shows Rs data in bulk and SOI samples im-\nplanted with 8 and 20 keV Ge and annealed for 60 s in the\ntemperature range of 700\u20131000 \u00b0C. This temperature range\nwas chosen in order to reveal the deactivation and reactiva-\ntion of B in bulk silicon and SOI. The data show the well\nknown reverse annealing effect associated with the deactiva-\ntion and subsequent reactivation and diffusive broadening of\nPAI B implants.3 In the SOI samples, Rs starts out \u0001at\n700 \u00b0C\u0002 about 100 \u0001 \/ sq higher than in the bulk samples,\npossibly as a result of a difference in the two materials. This\nfits with previously published observations of a lower level\nof B activation in SOI.8\nAt temperatures above about 750 \u00b0C, for both the bulk\nSi and SOI substrates, Rs rises steeply, as a result of B deac-\ntivation, reaching a peak at around 775\u2013800 \u00b0C in the 8 keV\nimplanted samples and around 850 \u00b0C in the 20 keV im-\nplanted samples. The shift in the temperature for peak deac-\ntivation is well known and is caused by a reduction in the\nconcentration gradient of interstitials towards the B-doped\nregion when the EOR band is located deeper into the\nmaterial.3,4 The rapid onset of deactivation is a result of the\nrapid Ostwald ripening\/dissolution phase of interstitial de-\nfects in the EOR defect band, during which a substantial\nfraction of the interstitials contained in the band are emitted\ninto its surroundings.3\nComparing now the deactivation in the SOI and bulk\nsamples in Fig. 1, we see that the change in sheet resistance\n\u0003Rs from the initial 700 \u00b0C to the peak is significantly\nsmaller in the SOI cases. In the 8 keV case, where the EOR\ndefects are located in the upper part of the SOI layer, the\neffect is small: \u0003Rs for bulk is \t1200 \u0001 \/ sq and for\nSOI \t1000 \u0001 \/ sq, the resultant \u0003Rs is 200 \u0001 \/ sq less in SOI\nFIG. 1.

However, in the 20 keV case, where the EOR\nownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject todefects are within the lower part of the layer, the resultant\n\u0003Rs is over 300 \u0001 \/ sq lower in SOI. This is about half the\namount of deactivation that occurs in the bulk sample.\nThese results show that the reduced deactivation of\npreamorphized B implants in SOI is strongly related to the\nposition of the EOR band within the silicon film. It is our\nhypothesis that the proximity of the EOR band to the buried\nSi\/SiO2 interface of the silicon top layer leads to an in-\ncreased number of interstitials migrating to this interface,\nthus reducing the number that can reach the shallow B-doped\nregion. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect to ob-\nserve a reduction in the density of EOR defects in the\n20 keV Ge PAI case, relative to the corresponding bulk case.\nSIMS results from the 20 keV Ge PAI as-implanted and\nannealed samples at 850 \u00b0C for 60 s in bulk and SOI are\nshown in Fig. 2 \u0001top\u0002. Several features are clearly evident.\nFirst, there is dramatically more transient enhanced tail dif-\nfusion in the bulk sample, indicating that a larger number of\ninterstitials have traveled from the EOR band to the surface\nin bulk Si than in SOI. Second, the kink concentration, at\nwhich boron diffuses into the wafer from the peak region of\nthe implant, occurs at a significantly higher concentration in\nSOI \u00013\u00021018 cm\u22123\u0002 than in bulk \u00011.5\u00021018 cm\u22123\u0002, indicat-\ning a higher level of activation in SOI in agreement with the\nelectrical data in Fig. 1. Third, in the bulk Si there is a peak\nin the tail of the boron profile, centered on a depth of 40 nm.\nThis corresponds to the position of the EOR defect band\n6\nFIG. 2.

In order to determine this quantity the SIMS\nprofile is interpolated from either side of the peak to obtain a\nbackground curve, and then windows are set on each side of\nthe B peak. The background is then subtracted and the re-\nsultant net peak area is divided by the background area. The\nresults, obtained as a function of annealing temperature and\nmaterial type, are shown in Fig. 2 \u0001bottom\u0002. The relative\nuncertainties between data points are comparable to the size\nof the symbols.\nThe graph shows that, over the entire temperature range,\nthe 20 keV Ge EOR band has a lower B trapping efficiency\nin SOI than in the corresponding band in bulk Si. At low\ntemperatures the difference between the materials is small\nand the trapping efficiency values increase slowly with tem-\nperature. It is interesting to speculate, in passing, about the\nreason for this increase. It occurs during a phase of very\nrapid Ostwald ripening within the EOR band, and arguably\nthe increase in trapping efficiency reflects the increase in\nmean lifetime of individual EOR defects, from short-lived\ndefects that quickly release B back to the lattice into slower\nevolving larger defects. The increase in trapping can be ex-\nplained if this longer lifetime is needed to bring about\n\u201cquasi-steady-state\u201d segregation between the lattice and the\nEOR band.\nMost importantly for the discussion in this letter, at tem-\nperatures above 800 \u00b0C, a clear difference emerges between\nthe amounts of B trapped at the EOR band in the two mate-\nrials. This coincides with a strong decrease in the overall\namount of trapping. These results are a strong indication that\n\u0001a\u0002 the defects have entered the dissolution phase and \u0001b\u0002 the\ndefect band is dissolving faster in SOI than in the bulk ma-\nterial. This is despite the fact that, as seen from the viewpoint\nof the B profile, fewer interstitials have flowed down the\nconcentration gradient from the EOR band to the B-doped\nregion near the surface.\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject toTo investigate the defect structure in more detail, bulk\nand SOI samples annealed at 800 and 850 \u00b0C were examined\nby plan-view and XTEM. Figure 3 shows weak-beam dark-\nfield XTEM micrographs for 20 keV Ge PAI in bulk Si and\nSOI annealed at 850 \u00b0C for 60 s. For this Ge PAI energy the\nEOR defects lie \t40 nm below the surface as indicated by\nthe arrow in Fig. 3. They are clearly evident in the bulk\nsilicon sample, but in the SOI sample their number has de-\ncreased so much that very few defects remain. Plan-view\nimages, which contain the full EOR depth distribution within\nthe TEM sample, show the same trend. Similar results, albeit\nwith a smaller decrease in defect density, occur after the\n800 \u00b0C anneal. These results confirm our conclusion from\nthe SIMS measurements in Fig. 2 that most of the EOR\ndefects have disappeared during the 850 \u00b0C anneal. This is\nclearly strong evidence in support of our hypothesis that the\nburied Si\/SiO2 interface of the silicon top layer becomes the\npredominant interstitial sink when the EOR band is located\nclose to that interface. It may also provide part of the expla-\nnation for the reduced interstitial defect content in \u0001non-\npreamorphized\u0002 B-implanted SOI, observed in earlier work.8\nIn conclusion, previously published results showing dif-\nferences in B activation and transient enhanced diffusion in\nSoitec\u00a9 SOI and bulk Si have been directly correlated with\nSIMS and XTEM data showing an accelerated dissolution of\nend-of-range defects in the SOI material. B activation, tran-\nsient enhanced diffusion, and the density of EOR defects all\ndecrease as the EOR band is brought closer to the buried\nSi\/SiO2 interface of the silicon top layer. We interpret this\nresult as evidence that a substantial portion of the interstitials\ncontained in the EOR defects are absorbed by the buried\ninterface, which acts as an efficient sink for interstitials.\nThe authors thank the UK Engineering and Physical Sci-\nences Research Council \u0001EPSRC\u0002 and the Surrey Ion Beam\nCentre for their support.
