The idea is now firmly established in OECD \nand national policies. This paper reviews the evidence and argues that this is \nessentially a faith-based policy since there is scant real evidence that making \ncommunities more mixed improves the life chances of the poor. There is \noverwhelming evidence that the attributes which make neighbourhoods attractive are \ncapitalised into house prices. This means that poor people cannot afford to buy into \nnicer neighbourhoods which anyway have amenities of no value to them. Moreover \n\u201especialised neighbourhoods\u201f contribute to agglomeration economies and seem to be \nwelfare enhancing. Thus policies for mixed neighbourhoods treat the symptoms rather \nthan the causes of poverty. Efforts to improve social equity would be more effectively \ndirected towards people themselves rather than trying to force neighbourhoods to be \nmixed. \n \n \nJEL Classifications: H41; H42; I30; I38; R23; R28 \nKey words: Mixed Communities; social exclusion; segregation; local public goods; \nhousing policy\nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n1 \n1.  Introduction1 \nIn this paper I analyse the welfare and equity implications of policies designed to \ncreate \u2017mixed communities\u2018 in cities compared to the \u2017fact\u2018 of social segregation: \nsegregation on the basis of income, ethnicity, age and other characteristics. This \nanalysis and re-assessment of the evidence calls into question current policies \ndesigned to produce \u2017mixed communities\u2018. Although empirically income mixing, even \nin very small neighbourhoods, is considerable (see, for example Hardman and \nIoannides, 2004) it is still true that poor people tend to be concentrated in poor \nneighbourhoods and richer people in more affluent ones.  \n \nIn the face of this voluntary residential separation of different groups, we behave and \napply policies as if it were a fact that their separation into distinct and relatively \nhomogeneous neighbourhoods generated specific social costs, additional to those \ngenerated by inequality itself. But careful examination of the evidence suggests that \nsuch policies for neighbourhood mixing are based more on faith than on any real \nevidence of additional social ills stemming specifically from geographical \nconcentrations of poverty and affluence. Indeed, although the focus of this paper is \nmainly on income mixing, it is not clear what social gains are derived from forcing \nneighbourhoods to be more mixed on the basis of any specific characteristic, whether \nincome, age, marital status, educational attainments or ethnicity.  \n \nThe policies of many liberal governments would be to favour greater equality and a \nprogressive tax system. If effective, such policies improve the life chances of the poor \nand disadvantaged. The question, however is whether \u2013 given the distribution of \nincome \u2013 policies to make neighbourhoods more mixed than individuals choose for \nthemselves is an effective way of helping the poor and disadvantaged. This issue is \nimportant because a reduction in the intensity of income segregation, by means of \nactive policies to foster \u2017mixed communities\u2018, is an explicit aim of government policy \nin many OECD countries and a favoured outcome of \u2017new urbanism\u2018.  \n \nThe fundamental issue underlying this paper\u2018s argument is one of causation. We know \nthat living in nicer neighbourhoods costs more. As I show below, it costs a great deal \nmore. So there is very clear evidence that poor people are concentrated in poor \nneighbourhoods as a result of their low incomes: living in cheap neighbourhoods costs \nless. The issue is whether living in a poor neighbourhood is a separate, significant \nadditional cause of poverty. To make a serious, evidence-based case that mixed \ncommunities are effective policies to reduce social inequality, we would need to \nestablish four key propositions: \n1. Geographically concentrated poverty was worse in welfare terms than diffused \npoverty; \n2. Creating mixed communities of poor and rich reduced the \u2017costs\u2018 of poverty; \n                                                 \n1 I would like acknowledge the financial support of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and thank Alison \nWeingarten for research assistance and Stephen Sheppard for our long term research collaboration. \nThis paper draws on ideas we have discussed and developed together over the years. In addition I have \nbenefited from discussions and input from many colleagues. I would like especially to thank Katharine \nKnox, Doug Krupka, Gwilym Pryce, Bruce Weinberg and an anonymous referee for helpful and \nsometimes critical comments. The paper has benefited from these. Although I have disagreed with \nseveral of the comments I hope the arguments have been strengthened and improved. The mistakes are \nentirely my own. \n \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n2 \n3. The welfare costs of geographically concentrated poverty were greater than the \nbenefits from living in \u2017specialised\u2018 neighbourhoods; \n4. Creating mixed communities of poor and rich was a cost effective way of \naddressing the problem of inequality. \n \nThe paper starts with a very brief discussion of the origins of the idea that mixed \nneighbourhoods offer a socially superior way of living, reducing the hardships and \ndisadvantages of poverty. The next section examines the evidence relating to the first \nof the above propositions: that living in a worse or more deprived neighbourhood is a \nseparate evil from poverty itself and reduces a person\u2018s (child\u2018s) chances in life over \nand beyond the disadvantages engendered by poverty. This is commonly called the \n\u2017neighbourhood effect\u2018 and is examined in two ways. I first examine the evidence on \nthe impact on welfare if people are moved from deprived neighbourhoods to more \naffluent ones. This draws mainly on evidence from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) \nexperiment in the US, a unique, semi-scientific, experiment set up to help some poor \nhouseholds make such a move and to track the results. The other main source of \nrigorous evidence is derived from cohort studies which attempt to isolate the specific \neffects of the type of neighbourhood from which a person originates (or has \npreviously lived) on life outcomes. The discussion then moves on to consider the \nevidence as to how neighbourhoods \u2017work\u2018 and influence both welfare and labour \nmarket outcomes. \n \nIn section 4 I review the evidence as to why neighbourhoods segregated by income \npersist. This looks first at the dynamics of neighbourhood segregation \u2013 what happens \nto people in poor neighbourhoods who upgrade their skills. Observations that there is \na significant income mixing at the local level have been based on cross sectional data. \nCross sectional mixing does not imply that mixed neighbourhoods are equilibrium \noutcomes. This section goes on to examine the way in which housing markets \neffectively price the poor out of nice neighbourhoods and how this process interacts \nwith (changes in) the distribution of income. \n \nI conclude by drawing together this evidence and discussing how it relates to the \narguments about the relationship between poverty and place and \u2017neighbourhood \neffects\u2018 and what policies might most effectively address the problems of poverty and \nincome inequality.  \n \n2. Why neighbourhoods should be mixed: but are not \n \nThe desire for neighbourhoods to be more \u2017mixed\u2018 or \u2017balanced\u2018 is not new. It can be \ntraced back at least as far as the 19th Century designers and visionaries who gave rise \nto the Garden City Movement and, ultimately, to town and country planning. One of \nthe first developments reflecting these new impulses was Bedford Park, in Chiswick, \nWest London, which began with the construction of the District line of the \nunderground in 1871. It was designed to provide a community within easy reach of \nLondon and to attract liberal professionals and artists, with cottages, as well as \nsubstantial middle class homes, in order to ensure \u2017social balance\u2018. The construction \nof cottages was stopped, however, soon after the first residents arrived and \ncomplained that such houses would \u2017attract the wrong sort of tenants\u2018 (Affleck \nGreeves, 1975). Similarly, Hampstead Garden Suburb, started in 1910 by two \ndisciples of Ebenezer Howard, was intended to be a \u2017balanced\u2018 community but within \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n3 \na short period had become an affluent professional suburb (Weinreb and Hibbert, \n1993).  \n \nMore recent work, associated notably with Wilson (1987), identified a problem of \nsocial exclusion, with significant harmful effects associated with living in \nneighbourhoods in which poverty was concentrated. This was part of the argument of \nthe British government department responsible for planning, housing and urban policy \nwhen \u2013 briefly \u2013 it was idiosyncratically known as the Office of the Deputy Prime \nMinister (ODPM, 2005): \n \n\u201cPeople living in deprived neighbourhoods are less likely to work, more likely to be \npoor and have lower life expectancy, more likely to live in poorer housing in \nunattractive local environments with high levels of antisocial behaviour and \nlawlessness and more likely to receive poorer education and health services. Living in \na deprived area adversely affects individuals\u201f life chances over and above what would \nbe predicted by their personal circumstances and characteristics.\u201d (ODPM, 2005, \npage 6). \n \nThe report documented in great detail differences in outcomes for people living in \ndeprived areas (defined as the 10% most deprived wards identified by the Index of \nMultiple Deprivation) compared to the average for England as a whole. \n\u2017Worklessness rates\u2018 (ODPM 2005\u2018s preferred measure combining the non-\nparticipants with the unemployed of working age) were some 25% compared to less \nthan 10%; a third more of the adult population of such areas had no qualifications; and \nlife expectancy was two years less. To conclude from this evidence that mixed \ncommunities provided a recipe for reducing inequality and tackling social exclusion, \nhowever, was either naive or demonstrated sleight of hand. None of the figures \nsupposedly showing the problems of living in deprived areas related to individuals of \ngiven or \u2017similar\u2018 characteristics to people not living in deprived areas. It was all \nmeasures of the average levels of income, health, education or \u2017worklessness\u2018 of the \ninhabitants of the deprived areas. Crime rates were just that: the rate of crime in \ndeprived neighbourhoods. The problem is that none of this evidence is in dispute. It \nsimply does not address the issue of causation.  \n \nNot only is the desire for mixed neighbourhoods not new, it is, one might suspect, \nsuspiciously old. It was originally formulated as a social aspiration without any \ndiagnosis of the root causes of poverty but a firm belief in improving peoples\u2018 lives by \nimproving the built environment. In the context of public health, this was perhaps the \nsingle biggest step towards making cities healthier and more habitable ever made. As \na solution for poverty, it appears only to address an obvious symptom. For a sceptical \nacademic, indeed, there must be a fear that researchers and policy makers for the past \n30 years, have been trying to retrofit the analysis and evidence to support the \n\u2017solution\u2018 fixed on by the pioneers of town planning in the 19th Century.  \n  \nIf the policy had no costs \u2013 even though it was not effective in improving welfare or \nreducing income inequality \u2013 it would not be problematic. Attempting to implement \nit, however, costs significant resources. This can be illustrated in Britain but similar \ncosts arise in all OECD countries which pursue policies for mixed communities. \nThere are direct government expenditures subsidising the provision of lower income \nhousing in higher income developments but in Britain most of the resources devoted \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n4 \nto generating mixed communities are provided in kind \u2013 not part of measured \ngovernment expenditure. Because of the extreme scarcity of developable land \u2013 the \nresult of 60 years of \u2017urban containment\u2018 policies \u2013 obtaining \u2017planning permission\u2018 \n(zoning permits to build houses) generates extraordinary increases in land values. \nAgricultural land in most of South East England increases in value from less than \n\u00a310,000 per ha to \u00a33, \u00a34 or even as much as \u00a38 million per ha on the outskirts of \nOxford or in the more desirable parts of Buckinghamshire (Valuation Office Agency, \n2007). To obtain the essential planning permissions, developers negotiate so-called \nSection 106 Agreements with the local planning authority obliging them to provide \nadditional development, or supply land, for \u2017public benefit\u2018: that is gift the specified \ndevelopments or provide them below cost. The most common form these benefits take \nis an obligation to build \u2017affordable\u2018 housing or \u2017social\u2018 housing within their \ncommercial development. Until a change in political control in 2008 the Greater \nLondon Authority, for example, demanded that 50 percent of all housing constructed \nby the private sector should be such \u2017affordable\u2018 housing built within each substantial \nprivate development.  \n \nPoor people are concentrated in poor neighbourhoods because housing there is \ncheaper. If that is the only direction of causation for observed patterns of segregation \nthen social segregation is a manifestation of voluntary sorting, conditioned by income. \nJust as richer households buy more expensive and better clothes and better holidays, \nhealth care and educational opportunities for their children, so they \u2017buy\u2018 better \nneighbourhoods. If this is the direction of causation, the equity problem is not with the \nplaces in which people live but with the distribution of incomes. Unless there is clear \nevidence of reverse causation, the case for mixed communities cannot be evidence \nbased.  \n \nIt is, of course, possible \u2013 superficially even plausible - that geographically \nconcentrated poverty is a greater social evil than dispersed poverty. There is a strong \ncorrelation between living in a deprived neighbourhood and being poor: or living in a \nneighbourhood dominated by immigrants or ethnic minorities and being an immigrant \nor a member of a minority ethnic group. So it might seem obvious that living in poor \nand deprived neighbourhoods must impose costs on the inhabitants of those \nneighbourhoods beyond the disadvantages of low incomes, poor health, migrant status \nor lack of labour market skills. The families living in such neighbourhoods experience \npoor services, frequently have a worse environmental quality (atmospheric pollution \nor noise), suffer greater ill health and are much more likely to be the victims of crime. \nThe schools which serve such neighbourhoods score less well measured by the exam \nresults their pupils achieve or by truancy rates. Children growing up in such \nneighbourhoods do not have the chances in life that children raised in advantaged \nneighbourhoods have. That seems obvious and it is what we appear to believe. \n \nThe problem with this conclusion is that it ignores a number of difficult facts. The \nfirst of these is that in all cities for which there is evidence, neighbourhoods have been \nsegregated. This was very clearly the case in ancient Rome in which there were \nneighbourhoods segregated by artisanal trade as well as income. The particular \npatterns of segregation seem to be remarkably stable over time. Many of the London \nneighbourhoods amongst the poorest in 1881 were still amongst the poorest in 2001 \n(Meen et al, 2007); there is substantial stability in the pattern of the local authority \nareas which were most segregated in 1971 and in 2001 (Meen, 2006). Moreover, \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n5 \nwhen policy has deliberately constructed \u2017mixed\u2018 neighbourhoods, over time they \nhave tended to become segregated again.  \n \nPerhaps the English village provided the romantic blueprint for the \u2017mixed \ncommunity\u2018. But even there, the \u2017rich man was in his castle and the poor man at his \ngate\u2018. Being small communities, however, the rich \u2017neighbourhood\u2018 sometimes \nconsisted only of the \u2017big house\u2018 or the manor. The rural poor often lived in crowded \nhovels \u2013 most of which have not survived. The larger an urban area is, the larger the \nareas dominated by particular types of household, rich or poor, tend to be (Gordon \nand Monastiriotis, 2006). As Krupka (2007) points out, using neighbourhoods of \nroughly constant size (such as Census Tracts or Local Authority areas) the larger the \ncity is, the greater the degree of measured segregation there will appear to be, other \nthings being equal. This is because there are enough households in particular income \ngroups to fill up more completely any fixed size of \u2017neighbourhood\u2018. Useful \ndefinitions of neighbourhood, therefore, are likely to vary with city size and be largest \nin the largest cities. \n \nWith the ex-urbanisation of British cities, villages \u2013 or at least those that have an \nagricultural origin - typically have become segregated, rich, commuter communities. \nFunctionally such villages have become high income component neighbourhoods of \nlarge city-regions. In the sense used in this paper, they are \u2017specialised \nneighbourhoods\u2018 of large urban areas2. Indeed, it can be argued that specialisation is \nthe central contribution of cities to progress and welfare.  \n \nUnderlying the longevity and pervasiveness of residential segregation in human \nsettlements is the second difficult fact ignored by advocates of \u2017mixed \nneighbourhoods\u2018. Specialisation underlies the agglomeration economies cities \ngenerate, both in production and in terms of the additional choices they provide for \nconsumption and lifestyles; and segregated neighbourhoods are simply the flip side of \nspecialised neighbourhoods. A larger number of specialised neighbourhoods provide a \nwider choice of urban community types and social settings in which to live. Like all \nother choices about what to consume, choosing where to live is strictly subject to the \nconstraint imposed by one\u2018s income.  \n \nThis is the third difficult fact advocates of mixed neighbourhoods ignore: establishing \nthe direction of causation. If neighbourhood choice is conditioned by income, poor \nneighbourhoods exist because there are poor people and we live in an unequal society; \nas is explained below, given that degree of inequality, we may be collectively and \nindividually better off, living in neighbourhoods with other similar households, \nwhether we are rich or poor. For any given distribution of household incomes that \ncould be an argument for allowing specialised neighbourhoods to develop of their \nown accord; but not for policies promoting specialised neighbourhoods (unless there \nis some problem of government or market failure that underprovides them). \n                                                 \n2 Throughout this paper the term \u2017specialised neighbourhoods\u2018 is used to indicate a residential \nneighbourhood in which households of a particular character tend to be concentrated. Deprived \nneighbourhoods would therefore be an example; but so would neighbourhoods predominantly occupied \nby other groups such as middle-aged, middle-class white commuters, young professionals, young \nfamilies, Sylheti-speaking Bangladeshi Muslims, Hindi-speaking Hindus or Polish migrant workers. \n \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n6 \nQuestioning the case for policies for promoting mixed neighbourhoods is certainly \nnot, however, advocating having greater inequity or poverty within a rich society. \n \nNot only do policies for generating mixed neighbourhoods ignore inconvenient facts, \nthey are also, as Krupka (2008) points out, at odds with three of the best established \ntheoretical models in urban economics. Tiebout (1956) has a model of mobile urban \nresidents voting with their feet to concentrate in communities providing the best mix \nof taxes and local public goods given their incomes and preferences. Alonso (1964) \u2013 \nstill perhaps the most important single theoretical contribution to urban economics \u2013 \nconcludes that with centrally located employment, annular rings of exclusive land use \nwill tend to be established as business users and residents trade-off the value to them \nof accessibility against the costs of space. This has traditionally been interpreted as \nimplying residential segregation by income group, with zones occupied at high \ndensities close to the centre by poor residents and richer households living at lower \ndensities further from the city-centre. Although this particular conclusion has been \nchallenged (by, for example, Brueckner et al., 1999), income segregation does seem \nthe likely outcome of monocentric models. Finally there is the model of Schelling \n(1969) which on the basis of a simple preference for not being the minority in ones \nimmediate neighbourhood predicts social segregation as the equilibrium outcome. \n \n \n3. Poverty and place: determining causation \n \nIn trying to figure out the direction of causation between poverty and place, there are \ntwo major problems. The first is how to be sure when we compare the outcomes for \nindividuals living in different types of areas that we have adjusted for all the relevant \ncharacteristics.  When studies compare indicators of deprivation of those living in \ndeprived communities with those living in more affluent neighbourhoods there may \nbe important but difficult to measure characteristics influencing people\u2018s life chances \nwhich are not standardised for because they are not observed. For example, there may \nbe a genetic pre-disposition to suffer from dyslexia which then influences a whole \nrange of other outcomes, including income and so neighbourhood choice; people also \nvary in their motivation and aspirations, even their luck.  \n \nThe second issue is that above all people select the neighbourhoods \u2013 subject of \ncourse to varying constraints \u2013 in which they live. As Goering et al (2003) point out: \n \n\u201cSince people typically select their neighbourhoods to match their needs and \nresources, researchers restricted to cross-sectional, nonexperiemental evidence must \ntry to separate the impact of personal factors affecting choice of neighbourhood from \neffects of neighbourhood. But it is difficult if not impossible to measure all those \nsocioeconomic, personal and local characteristics well enough to distinguish their \neffects.\u201d Goering et al, 2003, page 4. \n \nSeparating the impact of personal factors affecting choice of neighbourhood from the \neffects of neighbourhood requires great ingenuity and work on the part of the \nresearcher. The evidence on which ODPM (2005) based their policy \nrecommendations did not even begin to make the essential adjustments for difficult to \nobserve personal characteristics that methodological rigor demands. \n \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n7 \nExperimental evidence from moving poor people to affluent neighbourhoods \nThe US Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment is probably the most carefully \nresearched evidence available on the issue. The MTO programme was set up in 1992 \nto \u2017assist very low income families with children who reside in public housing\u2026. to \nmove out of areas with high concentrations of persons living in poverty to areas with \nlow concentrations of such persons\u2026\u20183 The MTO project was designed both to pilot a \npolicy designed to relieve the perceived problems of concentrated neighbourhood \npoverty and as a scientific experiment to investigate \u2013 some claimed demonstrate \u2013 \nthe benefits of policies to achieve more mixed communities. \n \nThe pilot was carried out in five cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and \nNew York. For the purposes of implementation \u2017neighbourhoods\u2018 were defined as \ncensus tracts, so on average they contained around 4,400 people. The issue of what \nconstitutes a neighbourhood is obviously an open one (see, for example, Ellen and \nTurner, 2003; Hardman and Ioannides, 2004; Durlauf, 2004; Bolster et al, 2007; or \nKrupka, 2007) but census tracts, which are designed to be relatively homogeneous in \nterms of population characteristics, are widely used as approximations in empirical \nresearch in the US.  \n \nTo be eligible for the programme a family had to live in public or assisted housing in \na \u2017poor\u2018 neighbourhood - one in which 40 percent or more of residents were below the \npoverty line. They also had to have at least one child under 18, not be behind with the \nrent, all family members had to be named on their current lease and no member of the \nfamily should have a criminal background. Thus, there were already two stages of \nselection before a family got on to the programme: 1) since only volunteers \nparticipated or were tracked, they had to want to move into a more affluent \nneighbourhood; and 2) they had to pass the eligibility criteria. This selection alone \nwould be likely to have increased the chances of finding positive effects of moving \npoor families to affluent neighbourhoods. The most problematic families were \nineligible and, presumably, only those who thought they had a chance of benefiting \nfrom such a move, volunteered4. There were also other factors, however, which \narguably may have reduced the chances of finding positive effects of the move: for \nexample, a significant proportion of the children involved remained in the same \nschool which had served their deprived neighbourhood. \n \nOnce in the programme families were randomly assigned to one of three groups. \nGroup 1 received a subsidy only spendable if they moved to a relatively affluent \nneighbourhood. An affluent neighbourhood was defined as one in which 10 percent or \nless of the residents lived below the poverty line. Such families received expert advice \nfrom housing professionals to help them find suitable homes. Group 2 received a \nhousing voucher\/subsidy spendable in any location and no counselling. Group 3 \u2013 the \ncontrol group - got no extra help but simply continued to live where they were \n(although of course free to move using their own resources). \n \nAcross the five cities about a quarter of potentially eligible families applied for the \nprogramme with about 13 percent of those applying being ruled out because they did \n                                                 \n3 Housing and Community Development Act 1992. \n4 It is worth noting that these methodological deficiencies would have disbarred the study had it been a \nfield trial for a new drug or medical procedure.  \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n8 \nnot meet the conditions for selection. That still left some 4,600 families \u2013 enough for \nstatistical analysis. The early evaluation of the programme, summarised in Goering \nand Feins (2003), was quite optimistic. Some of the successes reported were more or \nless definitional - such as the fact that the characteristics of the neighbourhoods in \nwhich those in Group 1 (assisted to move to more affluent neighbourhoods) lived at \nthe end of three years were more affluent, with lower crime rates and better schools. \nThere was also some evidence that successful movers had slightly different \ncharacteristics both from the residents of the poor neighbourhoods from which they \nwere drawn (younger and poorer and more likely to be a female headed household) \nbut also from those assigned to Group 1 but who failed to move, usually because they \ncould not find a house or flat to move to. Successful movers were more likely to be \nenrolled in adult education and drive a car: they tended also to have been more \ndissatisfied with their existing housing and neighbourhood. Wanting to escape from \nhigh neighbourhood crime rates was the most common reason for participation in the \nMTO project. \n \nThis early analysis of partial data suggested some positive findings. After two years \nthere were indications of improvements in children\u2018s behaviour, health and \neducational achievement, compared to the control group, although similar \nimprovements were observed in Group 2 families who had been helped to move to \nneighbourhoods of their own choice \u2013 not necessarily more affluent ones. There were, \nhowever, no differences in economic outcomes. Incomes and other labour market \nindicators for families moving to affluent neighbourhoods showed no improvement \nrelative to other groups. Nevertheless, the programme was greeted as cautiously \nsupporting the casual link from living in a deprived neighbourhood to negative \nimpacts on an individual\u2018s life chances. But as Goering and Feins (2003) went on to \nnote, the apparent modest initial success of the programme did not mean that it was a \npolicy success. The impacts were quite modest and costs were considerable. The \nadvice of the housing experts alone cost $3,000 per family that successfully moved.  \n \nLonger term follow-up \nMore recent research (Kling and Liebman, 2004; Kling et al 2005; Kling et al 2007) \non the MTO, tracking families over a longer period, destroys even this cautious \noptimism on the project: or at least suggests causal processes are considerably more \ncomplex and outcomes of moving to an affluent neighbourhood more difficult to \nanticipate. Kling et al (2005) report on a follow up study analysing changes four to \nseven years after families had moved and used all data for the five cities. Their study \nuses sophisticated statistical methods and focuses particularly on differences in crime \nand behaviour. \n \nKling et al\u2018s longer term follow-up confirms the finding of no improvement in \neconomic indicators for adults who moved but the researchers looked at a wide range \nof indicators relating to educational achievement, health and welfare and also \nbehaviour for younger people5. They focused on the age group \u2013 15 to 25 \u2013 in which it \n                                                 \n5 Kling et al 2005 report briefly on such factors as getting into fights, getting along with teachers, \nperceptions that school discipline was \u2017fair\u2018, having five or more friends and reported feelings of \nworthlessness, finding no significant differences on any measure. A wide range of educational, mental \nand physical health and behavioural indicators was examined in Kling and Liebman, 2004. In general \nthey reported some significant beneficial changes for girls but negative and mainly not significant \neffects for young males.  \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n9 \nwas most reasonable to look for signs of improvement. It is this age group which in \nthe general population has the highest incidence of behavioural problems and within \nwhich educational progress might be most plausibly concentrated. So if moving to a \nmore affluent neighbourhood produced any behavioural benefits these should be \neasiest to find in this age group. For none of the indicators, however, did they find any \nsignificant overall differences between the groups that moved neighbourhoods \ncompared to the control group that was not helped to move. For the age group as a \nwhole some indicators were better and some were worse but, despite the large sample, \nnone of these differences was statistically significant. \n \nSubdividing into males and females did reveal some significant differences, however. \nWithin the set of behavioural indicators were a number relating to criminality. Kling \net al (2005) extended the self-reported data set by also tracing administrative arrest \nrecords providing two independent sources of data. They found that while for violent \ncrime there continued to be non-significant but - if anything - favourable effects for \nboth the groups which moved, for property arrests there were significant differences \nfor girls compared to boys. For both boys and girls in the first two years after moving, \nproperty arrests fell, although the reduction was not statistically significant, but for \nboys it then rose and rose significantly compared to the control group during the third \nand fourth year after moving. Overall \u2013 for both sexes combined over the whole four \nyears - there was no significant reduction in either arrests in total or in property arrests \nbecause the differences for boys and girls balanced out. For a small sub sample which \nit was possible to track over a six year period, the increase in property crime arrests \nfor boys continued at about the same level. Similar, but non-significant, gender \ndifferences are reported, in passing, for mental and physical health, education and \nsubstance use. Overall, males in the moving group had scores on the behavioural \nproblem index some 20 percent worse and arrest rates for property crime some 30 \npercent higher than those of the control group of young males who did not move from \ntheir poor neighbourhoods. \n \nThey carefully sift the evidence for explanations of these differences in behavioural \noutcomes. The reduction in girls\u2018 arrest rates for property crime suggested the \nincrease in arrests for boys could not be explained by more efficient policing in the \naffluent neighbourhoods. Peer group sorting effects were implausible as an \nexplanation since similar patterns of change were evident for both boys and girls even \nwhen they were subdivided into those with a history of criminal or behavioural \nproblems before the move. If peer group sorting was the explanation then one would \nexpect those who had had worse behaviour prior to moving would not have improved \n(if girls) or got worse (if boys) after the move. Differences in coping strategies in \nrelation to the upset caused by moving to a different type of neighbourhood did not \nseem plausible as an explanation because in the early period following the move both \nboys and girls showed similar reductions in arrests: it was only after two years, when \npresumably most young people would have got over the disruptive effects of the \nmove, that boys\u2018 arrest rates for property crime rose significantly. \n \nThey come down in favour of what they call a \u2017comparative advantage in property \ncrime\u20186 explanation partly by elimination but also because of the evidence in relation \n                                                 \n6 By this they meant that the boys were doing not only absolutely worse in education and other realms \nthan their new, affluent peer group but relatively worse in such terms than they would have done in \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n10 \nto educational performance. Although the schools which young people went to after \nmoving to more affluent neighbourhoods were better on academic performance \nindicators for the children attending them, it turned out that moving did not \nsignificantly improve the educational performance of the individual children. Thus, \nchildren who did not move ended up doing better in school relative to their peers than \nchildren who moved. The children who moved now had academically stronger peers \nagainst whom they were measured. Moreover moving boys did worse than girls \nrelative to their new peer groups. They were less academically competitive than girls \nwere within their new schools. Boys were also less subject to parental supervision, \nhad more absences from school and lower educational ambitions than girls. The girls \nwho moved had improved expectations for completing college compared to the \ncontrol group, greater participation in sports, a reduction in school absences and an \nincreased association with peers who engaged in school activities. None of this was \ntrue of the boys who moved. Thus, the authors conclude the most plausible \nexplanation is that as boys adjusted to their more affluent neighbourhoods, they found \nthey had a comparatively worse position in educational terms compared to their new \npeer group neighbours but a realm in which they could succeed in their new \nneighbourhoods was property crime.  \n \nKling et al 2007 largely confirms these findings. It is methodologically even more \nrigorous but still finds no economic impacts \u2013 favourable or unfavourable \u2013 for adults \nin Group 1 nor evidence of improvements in physical health. They do find \nimprovements in mental health for both adults and young women apparently related to \nreductions in (fear of) crime.  They also find beneficial effects for young females on \neducational outcomes, risky behaviour and physical health but again in the change for \nyoung females and males together these were offset by significant deteriorations in \nthe same indicators for young males. So there was no net gain for young people \noverall from moving.  \n \nOne might comment, moreover, that if the improvements on mental health indicators \nresulted from reductions in the crime experienced by the moving groups it would \nseem likely to be orders of magnitude more cost-effective to achieve the reductions in \ncrime in deprived neighbourhoods in the first place by substantial increases in police \nand more effective police methods. The MTO programme, in so far as it had produced \nthe improvements in mental health for the group assisted to move to a more affluent \nneighbourhood, did so only for the tiny proportion of the original inhabitants who \nbenefited. Measures to effectively reduce crime within deprived, high crime \nneighbourhoods would benefit all residents not just the lucky few subsidised to move. \n \nThe MTO experiment has been summarised at length because, given the manifold \ndifficulties, it is the best source of evidence for identifying the effect moving from a \nreally deprived neighbourhood to a more affluent one has on those who make the \nmove; it is equally the best source of evidence for identifying any beneficial effects of \nconstructing mixed neighbourhoods. Other earlier studies and the initial evaluations of \nthe MTO project are summarised in Durlauf (2004). Durlauf concludes that on the \nbasis of studies then available, the balance of the empirical evidence did suggest there \n                                                                                                                                            \ntheir old, deprived neighbourhoods compared to the peers they would have had there; they do not say - \nbut perhaps they also imply - that they also had relatively more opportunities for property crime in their \nnew, affluent neighbourhoods. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n11 \nwas a significant influence of neighbourhood, although he was acutely aware of the \ndifficulties of identification7. \n \nThis conclusion is overtaken by the longer term follow up studies of the MTO project. \nThese show that moving to a more affluent neighbourhood does not improve an \nadult\u2018s economic situation and outcomes for children who move are complex and \ncausation is uncertain, even when there appear to be significant effects8. On balance, \nthere seem to be negative outcomes for boys on a range of indicators and positive \noutcomes for girls. One of the few indicators showing an improvement for both boys \nand girls is an important one \u2013 arrest rates for violent crime \u2013 but so far research does \nnot show this to be statistically significant.   \n \nThe evidence from other studies on neighbourhood effects \nSimilar experiments have not been tried in other countries. As an alternative \nmethodology long term cohort studies offer the best solution for identifying the pure \nimpact of neighbourhood on life chances. Two of the most convincing of these cohort \nstudies, one in Canada and one in Britain, show a similar lack of significant long term \neffects of neighbourhood on life outcomes or success. Oreopoulos (2003) tracked \nindividuals assigned as children to public housing locations in Toronto over 30 years. \nHe starts with a sample of children born between 1963 and 1970, living in public \nhousing projects with very different neighbourhood characteristics, and matches them \nby means of a very large administrative data base to their labour market \ncharacteristics in 1999. The simple relationship between neighbourhood and earnings \nappeared to be significant but, of course, families have a big influence on the \nbehaviour and choices of children. Once the earnings of siblings was added as an \nexplanatory variable, the statistical influence of neighbourhood entirely disappeared. \nThe final conclusion was that the characteristics of the neighbourhood in which an \nindividual was born or raised had no statistically significant effect on long term labour \nmarket outcomes or on prosperity.   \n \nThis finding is consistent with the methodologically completely different study of \nBolster et al (2007). Using a British Household Panel Survey derived cohort dataset, \nfollowing individuals for ten years, they find no evidence that original place of \nresidence had any statistically significant influence on subsequent labour market \nsuccess, whether measured as household incomes or as earnings. Their results may be \nslightly less persuasive than those of Kling et al or Oreopoulos since their data track \n                                                 \n7 He compared results of 25 studies published between 1982 and 2003. Outcome measures ranged from \nmarriage rates and teenage pregnancies through school drop out rates to standard labour market \nmeasures, such as wages or unemployment. All studies surveyed were econometric in nature and while \nsome found no evidence of neighbourhood effects, the majority did conclude there was an impact of \nneighbourhood on outcomes for individuals. However, as Durlauf notes, methodological problems are \nsevere and such evidence was unlikely to convince those who were sceptical. He wrote before the \nmethodologically most convincing studies, those of Oreopoulos (2003) and Kling et al (2005; 2007), \nwere available. \n8 Apart from the increase in boys\u2018 arrests for property crime in the longer term, the cause of some of \nthe improvements in health measures are unclear. For example Katz et al (2001) note that the \nsignificant improvement in childhood asthma for both families moving to more affluent \nneighbourhoods and those moving to locations of their own choice, could be due to characteristics of \nthe structures and particularly the absence of rats \u2013 a common asthma trigger - in the new homes and \nlocations: not to classic neighbourhood effects. If reduction in exposure to rats were the cause then \ngetting rid of rats would seem to be a very much more cost-effective policy to achieve the health \nimprovement than mixed communities. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n12 \nindividuals over only ten years and they investigate only economic outcomes. But \nthey explore a range of neighbourhood definitions, concluding that a small unit, of \nonly about 500 people, is the most appropriate measure of neighbourhood, and they \nuse statistically sophisticated techniques. They cannot entirely reject the possibility \nthat the original neighbourhood in which someone lived, influences their future \nprosperity but they find no statistical evidence that it does. Indeed, although not \nstatistically significant, their result is in fact the unexpected one. After standardising \nfor all the other factors which influence incomes and earnings, coming from a poorer \nneighbourhood is associated with increased current prosperity! They conclude: \n \n[This] \u2015does not remove [the case for] an area-basis for policy. The high levels of \nclustering may mean that the most efficient way of targeting individual policies is on \nan area basis. Nevertheless the results support the idea that the main sources of low \nincomes are to be found in earnings, employment and demographics, not in \nneighbourhood characteristics.\u201d Bolster et al (2007) page 34. \n \nWork for countries in continental Europe has not been able to apply such \nmethodologically robust methods. There are no examples of either quasi-experiments, \nsuch as the MTO project, or long term cohort studies. Musterd (2006), however, does \nreport work tracking individuals over time in The Netherlands and Sweden and \nrelating changes in their prosperity to their individual characteristics and the \ncharacteristics of the neighbourhood in which they originally lived. These are for \nsomewhat shorter periods than even the work of Bolster et al (2007) and the controls \nand statistical methods used are perhaps somewhat more limited. In The Netherlands, \nMusterd (2006) reports only the weakest and non-significant of neighbourhood effects \nfor the very poorest, although the impact of a \u2017bad\u2018 neighbourhood seemed to be \nslightly stronger for the next group up the ladder. Outcomes were measured as the \nprobability of moving out of benefits and into a paid job between 1989 and 1994. In \nthe Swedish cities there seemed to be more evidence of neighbourhood effects during \nthe 1990s although these were still weak and high immigration rates in the early part \nof the period may have influenced the results. In the Swedish work, neighbourhood \neffects were also measured in terms of probability of people of working age moving \ninto work off benefits, but over a longer period from 1991 to 1999. \n \nPerhaps the strongest evidence yet found for 'neighbourhood effects' comes from \nFrance. It relates to a restricted effect in educational achievement at school, however, \nrather than to long term outcomes for life chances (Goux and Maurin, 2007) but is \ncertainly worth taking into account. Their study exploits a feature of the French \nLabour Force Survey which samples clusters of neighbours and, using an IV \napproach, they show that various educational performance indicators are statistically \nrelated to those of immediate peers in the neighbourhood rather than the classroom; \nfor example, the probability of a 15-year old being held back a grade is about 8 \npercentage points higher (+16% of an SD) if other adolescents in their neighbourhood \nwere born at the beginning of the year (which in itself increases the probability of \nbeing held back by 15 percentage points).  \n \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n13 \nSpecialised neighbourhoods as sources of welfare \nAs noted above, the tendency for people to sort into segregated or, in some sense \nspecialised, neighbourhoods is a very strong one9. Cities which are socially segregated \nalong income lines are a universally established fact. Authors who have recently \naddressed such issues include H\u00e5rsman (2006), Meen (2006) and Musterd (2006). \nMeen\u2018s work for Britain, already briefly summarised, shows beyond argument that \nnot only is segregation on income and other measures a feature of cities at least since \nthe late 19\nth\n Century, but the incidence of such segregation is very persistent over \ntime. Many of the same cities with the sharpest incidence of spatially segregated \nneighbourhoods measured on 1971 data, reappear in 2001 data. Many of the most \ndeprived (and most affluent) neighbourhoods in London in 1881 appear again in much \nthe same positions in 2001.  \n \nH\u00e5rsman (2006) documents the stability of patterns of both income and ethnic \nsegregation, particularly in Stockholm. In his detailed study of the long term evolution \nof patterns of ethnic segregation, he shows how its incidence has tended to intensify \nover the last 20 years and is only partly explained by income differences. His \nevidence is at least consistent with people from ethnic minorities mainly choosing to \nlive in ethnically specialised neighbourhoods, despite official Swedish policy pushing \nfor ethnic mixing.   \n \nMusterd (2006) synthesises his work on three related areas: the (lack of) influence of \nsegregation on the overall economic prosperity of the wider urban area; the very \ndistinct neighbourhood choices of skilled workers in different economic sectors in \nAmsterdam; and comparative work on the effects of neighbourhood mix on individual \nsuccess in The Netherlands and Sweden summarised above. In particular, he shows \nthat highly skilled workers in different service sectors choose different types of \nneighbourhood. Workers in Information Communication Technologies, financial \nservices and banking choose to concentrate in the suburbs of Amsterdam while skilled \nworkers in the creative industries are selectively concentrated in central \nneighbourhoods.  \n \nLabour market matching \nThese findings are entirely consistent with those of Bayer et al (2005) for Boston. For \na sample of 110,000 employed people, they match the precise location of residence \nand jobs and find a very strong tendency for people who live in the same \nneighbourhood (defined as a census block) also to work in the same census block. \nThey make an elaborate and convincing effort to eliminate the effects of transport \nnetworks and other factors which might explain this finding independently of social \ninteractions with neighbours - excluding non-family members. They find strong \nevidence showing that such interactions between neighbours strongly influence the \n                                                 \n9 This is not to deny the fact that cross sectional data shows significant income mixing in even small \nneighbourhoods. Hardman and Ioannides (2004) report some two thirds of micro neighbourhoods \n(consisting of 10 households) contain at least one household with an income in the poorest one sixth of \nall households: and a half of micro neighbourhoods contain a family in the richest 20 percent of the \nincome distribution. Krupka (2008) comments that in most US cities well over half the variance in \nincome came from variations within the neighbourhood, as opposed to variation across \nneighbourhoods. But as he also points out this is still consistent with spatial segregation on the basis of \nincome being the equilibrium outcome. Cities as systems are subject to continuous shocks in terms of \ntheir size and the distribution of household incomes and adjustment to such shocks may be slow given \nthe costs of moving house. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n14 \njob locations of neighbours and that such interactions are more influential if \nneighbours are of a similar level of education, both parties have children and are of \nsimilar age. Their conclusion is that social interactions within neighbourhoods \nbetween people similar to each other are a significant factor in how urban labour \nmarkets work and people find jobs. \n \nBoth sets of findings are consistent with earlier US findings, such as those of Blau and \nRobins (1992), about the importance in job search of informal networks with friends \nand relatives. Blau and Robins found that while this was a frequent - but not the most \nfrequent - method of job search, and particularly important for the less skilled, it was \nthe most successful form of job search from the point of view of both workers and \nemployers. It produced the highest rate of job offers per contact and the highest rate of \njob offer acceptances. In their recent review of the literature, Ioannides and Loury \n(2004) report that, in addition, such jobs found through personal contacts lasted \nlonger, so that around half of all jobs were held by people who had found them this \nway. Ioannides and Loury also report a persistent increase in the use of informal \ncontacts as a means of job search over time \u2013 despite the rise in the internet \u2013 and that \nit is more prevalent, the larger a city is: in cities of more than 500,000 more than half \nof unemployed job searchers relied on friends and acquaintances; in cities smaller \nthan 100,000 less than 10 percent did. Friends and acquaintances were a much more \nimportant source of jobs for those searching while unemployed than for those looking \nfor new jobs while they were employed.  \n \nThese last two observations are particularly important in the present context. They \nshow an important source of positive effects of specialised neighbourhoods for lower \nskilled as well as for more skilled workers - unemployed job seekers are on average \nless skilled than employed job seekers but use friends and acquaintances more. The \nfact that the use of friends and acquaintances increases with city size is consistent \nwith the idea that specialised neighbourhoods represent a form of agglomeration \neconomy. An advantage of larger cities is that they can support a greater range of \nspecialised neighbourhoods and such neighbourhoods seem to be a fertile source of \neffective job matching. Of course, neighbourhoods could have such a high proportion \nof unemployed in them that job search advantages disappeared. The point is that \nforcing neighbourhoods to be mixed is likely to result in a loss of agglomeration \neconomies and a loss that has a disproportionate impact on the less skilled and \naffluent. \n \nAnother less obvious example of the ways in which specialised neighbourhoods may \nincrease productivity is provided by work on ethnic neighbourhoods. There are \nobvious consumption benefits involved, as is briefly summarised below, but they may \nalso yield income by helping people get information relevant to their jobs or finding \njobs. There have been numerous studies of the role ethnic neighbourhoods play in \nmediating access to jobs but a recent example in a European context is provided by \nthe work of Coniglio (2004). He has a model in which minority non-local language \nspeakers access labour markets via neighbourhood bilinguals who intermediate \ninformation within the wider labour market. Thus, for those who cannot speak the \nlocally dominant language, living in ethnically segregated neighbourhoods does not \njust provide consumption benefits in terms of access to culturally familiar goods and \nservices but it generates higher productivity and incomes. He shows that such a model \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n15 \nis consistent with the formation and stability of ethnic neighbourhoods in Norwegian \ncities. \n  \nConsumption and welfare benefits \nThere seems to be quite persuasive evidence that specialised neighbourhoods have \nlabour market advantages, even for the poor; indeed particularly for the less skilled \nwho rely on personal contacts to a greater extent to find jobs. Even if there are some \npossible negative neighbourhood effects for poorer groups \u2013 and the more \nmeticulously studies have been able to offset for other factors influencing personal \noutcomes, the less have they found any such effects \u2013 still the question also has to be \nasked: are there also consumption benefits from living in specialised, and so \nsegregated, neighbourhoods? People systematically tend to choose such \nneighbourhoods. That, itself, suggests there might be benefits which would be lost if \nwe adopt policies to compel mixed neighborhoods.  \n \nChoice of neighbourhood is constrained by income, as are most economic choices, \nbecause houses in nicer neighbourhoods cost more (as is discussed in detail below) \nbut people choose neighbourhoods on the basis of what a neighbourhood offers them \nwhich will either yield welfare directly or increase their expected incomes. And \nspecialised neighbourhoods are better able to do both.  \n \nSpecialised neighbourhoods provide direct consumption benefits both because they \nincrease the range of choice for people with respect to the types of neighbourhood in \nwhich to live; and people and families of similar incomes, tastes or points in the life \ncycle tend to consume similar goods and services and require similar amenities. \nLiving in a neighbourhood with a local wholefood supermarket, Montessori school, \ngastropub or microbrewery commands a premium: neighbourhoods with \npawnbrokers, a local Aldi or discount store and a takeaway are cheaper. If you are a \nrecent immigrant and want to be able to continue to speak your original language, \nengage in your native culture or religion, and buy food or other items you have \ndeveloped a taste for, then there are great advantages in living in neighbourhoods with \nconcentrations of people of similar origin. This is one obvious source of the ethnic \nneighbourhoods of large American and European cities. A recent study of children in \nprimary schools found 300 different languages communities in London (Baker and \nEversley, 2000) living in linguistically and culturally specialised neighbourhoods. \n \nSuch agglomeration economies in consumption are not confined to ethnic groups. \nFamilies with young children will find benefits of networks and facilities, and mutual \nsupport as well as information, if they live in neighbourhoods with substantial \nnumbers of families at the same stage in life. Young singles who eat out and have a \ntaste for urban entertainment and culture will similarly find agglomeration economies \nin consumption if they find neighbourhoods in which large numbers of like minded \npeople are concentrated. More educated people, and people working in the liberal arts, \nmay prefer to live in neighbourhoods with concentrations of similar types, sharing \nleisure and cultural pursuits and seeking similar local shops; business people may \nequally gain consumption benefits from concentrating in neighbourhoods in which \nother business people live. \n \nIdeas and insights about the contribution of specialised neighbourhoods to \nproductivity go back a long way \u2013 for example to Marshall\u2018s (Marshall, 1890) famous \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n16 \naccount of the ways in which Industrial Districts increase productivity and growth, \nbecause \u2017knowledge is in the air\u2018. Luttmer (2005) explores the central idea that \npeople\u2018s welfare depends not just on their income but decreases as their own income \nfalls relative to other people in the community. This idea also has distant roots. He \nquotes John Stuart Mill:  \n \n\u2026.men do not desire merely to be rich, but richer than other men\u201d \n \nIn attempting to test for the significance of this proposition and quantify its effects, \nthere are a number of methodological problems - particularly the possibility that \nwelfare is itself a relative concept. However, Luttmer (2005) goes to considerable \nlengths to eliminate possible biases from his estimates, including testing against \nabsolute measures related to welfare, such as marital conflicts, as well as against \nreported personal welfare itself. He analyses a sample of about 10,000 individuals \nfrom two phases10 of the National Survey of Families and Households living in a \nsample of 965 neighbourhoods - or 555 neighbourhoods for the sub sample of \nneighbourhoods with respondents living in them at both time periods. His findings are \nstriking. Roughly speaking losing $1,000 of own income seems to make people feel \nabout as much worse off as their neighbour gaining $1,000!  The estimated impact of \na positive change of household income on reported welfare is quantitatively almost \nthe same as a similar, negative, change in neighbourhood mean incomes.  \n \nHe subdivides the sample into households of single adults, couples living together at \nboth sampling dates (stable couples) and adults living with different partners in the \nsecond time period. The strong negative impact of neighbours being richer on \npeoples\u2018 sense of wellbeing estimated for the three groups together turns out to be \nexplained mainly by the (large) sub sample of stable couples in the data set. Single \npeople do not seem to experience a loss of a sense of wellbeing from neighbours\u2018 \nextra income. Moreover, the effects are stronger for individuals who socialise with \nneighbours and the effect of neighbours\u2018 incomes is stronger if the neighbour is more \nsimilar to you (only tested for those with and without a college education). If \ndisaggregated measures of reported welfare are analysed then the main effects were in \nterms of time with family and hours worked. That is, it appears that people living in \ncommunities where neighbours have higher mean levels of income relative to their \nown, compensate by working longer hours and spending less time with their families \nand in leisure. This causes them to feel themselves to be worse off and have lower \nreported welfare. The evidence points to a real impact of relative, as well as own, \nincome on welfare. \n \nMoreover, there is no significant effect of overall neighbourhood inequality. That \nimplies it is not living in a less equal neighbourhood that lowers an individual\u2018s \nwelfare but specifically having an income lower than the neighbourhood average. \nPerhaps the main problem with what is a very careful study is the definition of \n\u2017neighbourhood\u2018. For reasons of data availability these are the Public Use Microdata \nAreas which, in the 1990 Census, had a mean population of 144,000 people. They are \ncertainly considerably larger, therefore, than the usual concept of a neighbourhood. \nOn the other hand, given that the findings capture a real effect of relative \nneighbourhood income which, on the basis of the accumulation of evidence Luttmer \n                                                 \n10 1987-88 and 1992-94 \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n17 \n(2005) provides, seems plausible, then having data for smaller areas, corresponding \nmore closely to conventional ideas of neighbourhoods, would seem likely to make the \nimpact more significant still. The study finds strong evidence that social interaction \nwith neighbours is a causal factor and presumably social interactions per neighbour \nare considerably greater with your nearest 500 neighbours than with those living far \naway and not sharing the same schools, shops or parks. In a neighbourhood of \n144,000 there will be few such opportunities to interact with most \u2017neighbours\u2018; in a \nsmaller neighbourhood of 500 the chance of such interactions increases greatly. So the \nincomes of nearer neighbours seem more likely to affect one\u2018s sense of wellbeing than \nthose of more distant ones and consequently one might expect Luttmer\u2018s results to \nhave been even more powerful had he had data for smaller neighbourhoods.  \n \nThe implications of these findings, therefore, would be that welfare in society is \ntotally unaffected by whether the rich live mixed with the poor or not. The welfare \ngains of one group would be offset by the losses of the other. It is just that if the poor \ndo live close to the rich they will feel worse of than if they do not. The rich, of course, \nwould feel even better off so mixing communities effects a net welfare transfer from \nthe poor to the rich: plausible but hardly the intended result of a mixed neighbourhood \npolicy.  \n \n4. The dynamics of neighbourhood segregation \n \nThere is little argument about the fact that people and households select themselves \ninto neighbourhoods and that neighbourhoods tend to have a degree of homogeneity \nwith respect to the characteristics of the people and families who live within them. \nEqually, the fact that cities have neighbourhoods segregated on the basis of income is \nuncontested although the extent of neighbourhood income heterogeneity at any point \nin time is significant. The issue is why rich and poor neighbourhoods emerge and, \nspecifically, does living in a poor neighbourhood make poor people or their children \neven worse off than they would otherwise have been? Associated with that question is \nwhether, if living in a poor neighbourhood does make people even worse off than they \nwould otherwise have been, is the impact sufficient that policy should specifically \naddress it?  \n \nIt is perfectly possible that any neighbourhood effect - if it exists - is comparatively \nsmall and that the cost of policies to address it effectively is so great compared to the \ncosts of other policies to improve the welfare of poor people that attempting to \nachieve \u2017mixed neighbourhoods\u2018 is simply not cost effective. It has already been \nnoted that for the MTO project the average cost per head of just providing the expert \npersonal advice needed to help poor people successfully find accommodation in an \naffluent neighbourhood was $3,000. Something the studies did not examine at all was \nwhat happened to the houses vacated by the participants who moved out of the poor \nneighbourhoods. Assuming they were in turn filled by other poor people, then the \nwhole MTO effort might not have changed the total number of households still living \nin poor neighbourhoods. That would be conditioned on where the new occupants of \nthe vacated houses came from and whether they moved voluntarily. \n \nThis brings one to the issue of neighbourhood dynamics. Too frequently, the \nassumption implicit in arguments for neighbourhood-based policies is that the \ninhabitants \u2013 the \u2017local community\u2018 \u2013 are a stable set of families. But this is not the \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n18 \ncase. Neighbourhoods are more like buses with a constantly changing set of people in \nthem: people\/families are always moving in and others moving out. This process is \nnot random and may be significantly influenced by neighbourhood-based policies \nthemselves. The overall pattern of neighbourhoods is also related to the overall \ndistribution of income within the urban housing market concerned: a case can be \nmade, indeed, that neighbourhood segregation by income \u2013 remembering that many \npersonal characteristics such as health, membership of disadvantaged groups, \neducation and skills as well as criminality \u2013 are strongly correlated with income \u2013 is \neffectively just the spatial articulation of the overall income distribution. \n \nIf society\u2018s income becomes more unequally distributed \u2013 the rich become richer \nrelative to the poor \u2013 then residential segregation should be expected to become more \nsharply demarcated; \u2017society\u2018 again being composed of the set of households who \noccupy a given housing market area.11 The mechanism which produces this \nassociation between inequality and spatial segregation is the interactive sorting role of \nhousing and labour markets. Both housing and labour markets are intrinsically \n\u2018spatial\u2019. Houses and jobs are located precisely in space and the occupation of a \nparticular house simultaneously determines a person\u2019s access to their current job and \nother jobs and confers the ability to \u2018consume\u2019 a wide range of amenities, \nneighbourhood characteristics and local public goods. \n \nMobility \u2013 getting on means getting out? \nFirst, let us look at some of the evidence of the determinants of mobility between \nneighbourhoods and why we should not expect policy interventions to be random in their \nimpact on the composition of a neighbourhood. An evaluation of a City Challenge \nprogramme of urban regeneration in Harlesden, in West London, a seriously deprived \ncommunity of about 10,000 people, suggested that training programmes had been well \ndesigned (after a false start) and well delivered12. There had also been improvements \nin a range of neighbourhood qualities such as fear of crime. The City Challenge \nprogramme had lasted for 5 years and had injected substantial funds - \u00a337.5 million. \nDespite the apparently successful training provided and the focus of the funding, \nunemployment among people living in the City Challenge neighbourhood at the end \nof the programme was higher relative to both West London as a whole and to \ncomparable disadvantaged neighbourhoods than it had been before the programme. \n \nAn obvious potential explanation was that people who had improved their labour \nmarket position as a result of the programme had differentially moved out of the \nneighbourhood. People had moved into the vacant housing to replace those moving \nout but those moving in had even more unfavourable labour market characteristics \nthan the average for the community as a whole; and worse than those they replaced. \nTo the extent the training programmes succeeded, they induced more churn. \nParadoxically, therefore, the very success of the programme \u2013 if it had induced \nselective mobility \u2013 could have led to the deterioration in the unemployment rate of \ncurrent residents noted at the end of the period. \n \n                                                 \n11 We can adapt DiPasquale and Wheaton\u2018s (1996) definition of a geographical real estate market: a \ngeographic\/spatial housing market is the area which \u2017encompasses all housing units that are influenced \nby the same economic conditions\u2026\u2018 \n12 This section draws on Cheshire et al., 1998. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n19 \nTo test this three samples were constructed of people of working age by comparing \nelectoral registers for the start and end of the period: one sample was of people \nmoving out of the neighbourhood during the period of the programme (the \n\u2018Outmovers\u2019); one of people resident within the neighbourhood throughout (the \n\u2018Stayers\u2019); and a third of people moving into the neighbourhood over the five years of \nthe programme (the \u2018Inmovers\u2019). All Outmovers who could be identified and tracked, \nwere surveyed. Samples of the other two groups were drawn randomly from the \nelectoral register. Tracking Stayers and Inmovers was not difficult but tracking and \ninterviewing Outmovers presented more problems. They were tracked by personally \ncalling at their former addresses and asking for their current whereabouts and also by \nusing electoral registers for the end period for all London Boroughs and, from those, \nidentifying electors who had previously been resident in the Harlesden City Challenge \narea. Very few former residents moving out of London altogether were traced. This \nallowed us to track and interview a sample of 50 Outmovers but there was probably \nsome selection bias with respect to those who were located and interviewed since \nsuccessful returns from Outmovers not on the electoral register in their new \ndestinations were particularly difficult. Two thirds of the interviewed Outmovers were \ntraced by comparing electoral registers.  \n \nThe usefulness of the training schemes provided by the City Challenge programme \nwas rated highly and this rating did not vary between groups. Attendance on the \ntraining schemes among the currently employed, however, had varied considerably \nacross groups. The Stayers and the Inmovers displayed very low levels of \nparticipation (Stayers 13%; Inmovers 6%) whereas 37% of the Outmovers had \nattended such courses.  Perhaps reflecting this, the Outmovers, as Table 1 shows, had \nsubstantially improved their position in the labour market compared to five years \npreviously on all dimensions and this improvement was statistically significant \ncompared to either of the other groups. \n \nTable 1: Mean rating of current job compared to job held 5 years previously * \n Sample size \n(total number) \nSkill Level of \nJob \nPay Conditions Satisfaction \nStayers 270 0.45 0.63 0.53 0.54 \nInmovers 63 0.77 1.23 1.23 0.92 \nOutmovers 48 1.4 1.47 1.6 1.2 \nRespondents rated the four attributes of their current jobs relative to the job they had held 5 years \npreviously on a five point scale ranging from -2 (much worse) to +2 (much better): so the larger the \nnumber the greater the improvement. \n \n \nTable 2: Labour Market Position at Time of Survey \n Sample size \n(total number) \nInactive \n(%) \nCurrently Unemployed \n(%) \nEmployed \n(%) \nStayers 270 42 15 41 \nInmovers 63 31 21 48 \nOutmovers 48 39 9 51 \n \nThe Outmovers were less likely to be unemployed than either other group (Table 2) \u2013 \nalthough this was only statistically significant when compared to the Inmovers. Not \nonly that but if employed, Outmovers were significantly more likely than either other \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n20 \ngroup to have a full time job. Of the currently employed in the Stayers group, 23% had \na part-time and 77% a full-time job, whereas amongst the Inmovers only 13% had a \nfull time job. Amongst employed Outmovers, in contrast, 97% were working full time. \nThus, this evidence on the relationship between mobility and labour market position, \npoints very strongly to the conclusion that if a person living in a deprived \nneighbourhood improves their employability and gets a job, they have a much \nincreased probability of moving out to a better neighbourhood. It also, of course, \ndemonstrates the irrelevance of judging the success of programmes designed to \nimprove the employability and life chances of the residents of deprived \nneighbourhoods by the unemployment rate of the residents of that neighbourhood at \nthe end of the programme. The more successful the programme, the more mobility it is \nlikely to induce regardless of where jobs are located since those who upgrade their \nskills and get (better) jobs  \u2013 even if they get a job close to where they used to live \u2013 \nare more likely to move to a less deprived neighbourhood.  Since Inmovers have much \nhigher unemployment rates than other groups, the measured unemployment rate of \ncurrent residents will rise. Compared to the MTO programme, which had no impact on \nthe labour market position of adults moving to affluent neighbourhoods, it should, \nhowever, be noted that providing well designed training for Harlesden City Challenge \nresidents did improve their labour market positions: but those who benefited \ndisproportionately moved out.  \n \nThis was a \u2018placed-based\u2019 policy intended to help people and it is difficult to think that \nat such a local level and in such a deprived community there was a significant problem \nof market failure associated with a loss of social capital and sense of place as a result \nof induced outward movement (see Bolton, 1992 for a discussion of these issue sin a \nwider context). It was the impact of the programme on the employment prospects of \npeople which would seem to be the relevant criterion for judging success: not the \nimpact on unemployment of people who happened to live in Harlesden at particular \ndate(s). \n \nNicer neighbourhoods cost more \nAs Table 1 shows, improving one\u2019s labour market position usually implies becoming \nricher. The Outmovers not only had relatively more skilled and more interesting jobs \nbut their relative pay had increased compared to the other groups. As we learn more \nabout how housing markets work, so we can understand better how they may interact \nwith labour markets to sort households and individuals into more and less desirable \nneighbourhoods on the basis of their incomes. Cheshire and Sheppard (2004) focus on \nthe case of good schools. Better schools (when access to a school is determined by \ngeographical catchment areas) are an example of a whole class of \u2017goods\u2018 one might \ncall truly \u2017positional\u2018. That is goods which can only be consumed by living in the \nappropriate place where they are available; and for which the ability to buy houses \ngiving access to them is chiefly determined not by absolute income but income \nrelative to others who are competing for the same \u2017goods\u2018. The most important and \nobvious of these in Britain is access to the best State schools. To the extent that a \nfamily\u2018s address controls access to these, educational policy in Britain has created a \nsituation in which it is not the most gifted or the most deserving who benefit from the \nbest, supposedly free, State schools but those whose parents can afford to buy access \nto them through the housing market. \n \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n21 \nThere is now a wealth of evidence showing that housing is a complex good, composed \nof many attributes or characteristics, each of which commands a price. Since Rosen \n(1974) \u2017hedonic\u2018 analysis has become the standard framework within which these \nprices are analysed and estimated. The price of any given house can be thought of as \nthe sum of the prices being paid for all its individual and particular attributes given \ntheir quantities. Although the idea is simple, it has proved fruitful as a way of \nanalysing housing markets. Hedonic studies of housing markets have mushroomed \nand it seems to be an area in which genuine progress of a scientific kind has been \nmade. Studies have incrementally improved the methodology and refined the \nestimation process.  \n \nEvidence that people buy local public goods through their choices in the housing \nmarket goes back at least to Oates (1968) and estimates of the price paid for school \nquality have improved over time. Recent studies in the US have included Haurin and \nBrasington (1996) and Black (1999). One of the first studies in the UK was Cheshire \nand Sheppard (1995) but more recent estimates by the same authors (Cheshire and \nSheppard, 2004) reveal much more about the process. Indeed, it has become \nincreasingly clear how complicated housing markets are and how sophisticated are the \nways in which housing attributes \u2013 and so ultimately housing itself \u2013 are priced.  \n \nWhat people appear to buy as they engage in house hunting is not the current set of \nattributes but something corresponding to the expected long run set of attributes. \nCheshire and Sheppard (2004) found that it was not just the current quality of primary \nschools (measured by their students\u2018 performance on standardised tests), which \ndetermined the price paid for access to \u2017primary school quality\u2018. The price paid also \nincorporated a discount for current school quality dependent on the variance in \nmeasured quality over the previous five years. There was also a discount if the house \nwas located in an area in which new construction was concentrated. Interestingly the \neffect of more new construction in the local area in depressing house prices was \nspecifically related to school quality. There was no evidence of just a general negative \n\u2017area of new construction\u2018 effect. It was only when local new construction was \nexpressed as a discounting factor on local school quality that a statistically significant \neffect on house prices was found. More local construction increased the likelihood \nthat an address could be re-assigned to another school as the Local Education \nAuthority implemented its explicit policy of filling its available school capacity. It \nmay also have increased uncertainty about the composition of the intake to the local \nschool in the future as new households moved into the neighbourhood.  So both more \nvariation in performance in the past and more local new construction reduced the \nprice buyers would pay for the current performance of the school a house gave access \nto. \n \nMoreover, studies are finding increasingly complex interactions with other variables. \nFor example, the price paid through the housing market for access to parks or open \nspace of a given character appears to vary with the density of the neighbourhood, \nhousehold incomes and local crime levels (Anderson and West, 2006); the price paid \nfor proximity to open countryside varies with the likelihood of its remaining \nundeveloped (Irwin, 2002). In the context of school quality, Cheshire and Sheppard \n(2004) found that the price paid for a given quality of local school varied with the \nsuitability of the house to accommodate children. These are not surprising findings \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n22 \nbut data and methods make it increasingly possible to estimate them and make those \nestimates increasingly credible. \n \nWhat hedonic studies of housing markets show is that access to higher amenity open \nspace, natural amenities like views or proximity to water, greater security from crime \nor better quality state provided education, costs a substantial amount. The value of all \nsuch amenities and local public goods is capitalised into house prices. As an example, \nmoving an otherwise average house from the catchment area of the worst to that of the \nbest primary school in Reading in 1999\/2000 was associated with an increase of one \nthird in its price13.  \n \nThus, the ability to benefit from or consume such localised goods is dependent on the \nability of a household to buy a house in those particular neighbourhoods which give \naccess to them. Since the supply of such goods is relatively inelastic and varies \nsignificantly from neighbourhood to neighbourhood and demand appears to be \nincome elastic (Cheshire and Sheppard, 1998), the price rises sharply with increasing \nquality and rising income. But their more or less fixed supply also means that the \nability to buy such goods is more determined by how rich a household is relative to \nother households competing for the same local amenities than it is by the household\u2018s \nabsolute income: that is, by where a household is in the distribution of incomes in the \nhousing market area concerned.  \n \nMore fundamental aspects of how people live and how real welfare is distributed \nappear to follow from this observation.  As was discussed in Brueckner et al. (1999), \ncities have a natural geographically and topographically determined endowment of \nsome amenities \u2013 where the best views are to be had, where the natural amenities such \nas river frontage are available or where, as determined by prevailing winds, air quality \nis better. In the context of most Old World cities, of course, there was also a fixed \nneighbourhood within which a particularly valuable local public good \u2013 security \u2013 \nwas available: within the city walls. These locationally fixed amenities or public \ngoods generated clustering of those households who had a taste for and could afford \nthem. In turn, this generated higher local incomes, supporting better local cultural and \ncommercial amenities and classier neighbourhoods with better schools and lower \ncrime rates. This further re-enforced the attractions of the more attractive \nneighbourhoods. \n \nWhile it is common to think of the prices of composite goods, such as housing, as \nbeing the sum of a set of prices for the individual attributes of which they are made \nup, it is less common to consider a market for each relevant attribute with its own \ndemand and supply characteristics. Yet, that is clearly important and the supply \ncharacteristics of individual housing attributes will vary significantly. Some, such as \n                                                 \n13 In the models discussed here all prices are estimated to vary not just as the quantity of the attribute in \nquestion changes (for example the first bathroom is worth a lot more than the fifth) but as the quantity \nof other attributes varies (for example, the price paid for more space inside a house of given size also \nvaries with the size of the garden, or the value paid for primary school quality varies with the suitability \nof the house to accommodate children). As a result, this calculation of the impact on price of moving a \nhouse from the worst to best primary school catchment area can only be done by assuming some \nparticular levels for all other attributes. Here it is assumed that all other attribute levels are equal to the \nsample mean, the sample being a random sample of houses sold in the local housing market in \n1999\/2000 used to estimate the model. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n23 \ncentral heating or the number of rooms in a given space, can easily be reproduced \nindustrially and so will be elastic in supply. Others would, in the absence of \nregulation, normally be elastic in supply. More urban space in aggregate (except in \nexceptional places such as Singapore) can always be made available by the \nconstruction of additional transport infrastructure. In Britain, and increasingly in other \ncountries, the supply of urban space is constrained by land use regulations such as \ndensity controls, urban containment, local zoning or protective designation. Other \nattributes, such as access to particular natural amenities, open spaces or the \u2017best\u2018 \nlocal, state funded school, may be intrinsically in very inelastic supply. As noted \nabove, the demand for most characteristics - including housing space, classier \nneighbourhoods and local amenities appears to be income elastic. Estimates in \nCheshire and Sheppard (1998) were that for many attributes of this type, evaluated at \nmean household income, income elasticities of demand were in the range 1.5 to 2.  \n \nIt would appear to follow from this that competition for access to better quality, \nlocationally fixed \u2017goods\u2018, will price poorer households out of access to \u2013 or at least \nforce them to consume lower quality  - local public goods and amenities \u2013 and so \ngenerate systematic patterns of residential segregation between richer and poorer \nneighbourhoods. Given that poverty is correlated with other characteristics such as \nlower educational attainment, poorer health, higher unemployment and membership \nof disadvantaged groups, it would seem plausible that residential segregation is \nlargely the spatial articulation of income inequality in society (though of course there \nmay be residential segregation between households of similar mean incomes but \ndifferent tastes or characteristics). Residential segregation is associated with lower \nwelfare for poorer groups since households derive significant welfare from access to \nthe better quality local public goods, including better security, and amenities. This is \njust another manifestation of the price mechanism interacting with the distribution of \nincome to allocate goods according to ability to pay and preferences. Indeed, it may \nbe an important part of the explanation why access to public services provided out of \ntaxation is closely correlated with the distribution of income (Goodin and Le Grand, \n1987). Although they appear to be distributed according to need, in many cases you \nhave to \u2017buy\u2018 access to them through the housing market. \n \nA further implication is that if the distribution of household incomes changes, this will \nbe reflected in a changing intensity of residential segregation. If, for example, \nincomes become more unequally distributed \u2013 as happened in the UK, the US and \nseveral other OECD countries from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s \u2013 under certain \ncircumstances described below, there should, other things being equal, be an \nintensification of residential segregation with the richest and poorest households \nbecoming relatively more concentrated in richer and poorer neighbourhoods14. An \nincrease in residential segregation has certainly been documented in the US context as \ndiscussed by Massey and Fischer (2003). They show that inequality across regions has \ndecreased while at the same time between neighbourhoods in US urban areas it has \nincreased. \n \nThis pattern is to be expected if the supply of at least some of these localised goods is \ninelastic (the \u2017best\u2018 local state school or a house overlooking Hampstead Heath or the \n                                                 \n14 And, of course, if property owners already living in more\/less desirable neighbourhoods, \nexperiencing rising\/falling relative asset values too \u2013 see below. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n24 \nThames, for example) while the demand is income elastic. If these conditions hold \nthen their relative price should be expected to increase if the rich get richer relative to \nthe poor. More expensive houses in more expensive neighbourhoods will become \nrelatively more expensive still, pricing the poor out to less desirable neighbourhoods \neven more completely.  For example if only 0.05 percent of houses in London can \noverlook a feature as attractive as Hampstead Heath then your the ability to \u2017buy\u2018 that \nfeature does not depend so much on your absolute income as on your income relative \nto the incomes of other households who have a taste for overlooking Hampstead \nHeath. \n \nAnalysis of the structure of house prices as the quantities of attributes increase \nproduces results that are consistent with this perspective. Returning to the findings of \nCheshire and Sheppard (2004) with respect to the price paid for school quality they \nreport a highly non-linear price function with very little change in price if the local \nschool goes from being the worst to middling. The price change associated with \nmoving from the 75\nth\n percentile point in the quality distribution to the best of all \u2013 the \n100\nth\n percentile point \u2013 however, was very large indeed. Their estimates imply \nmoving an otherwise average house from the catchment area of the worst primary \nschool to that at the 10\nth\n percentile in the quality distribution made no discernable \ndifference to its price; moving it from that of the 10\nth\n to the 90\nth\n percentile in the \nquality distribution increased the price by 10.4 percent; but moving it from the 90\nth\n to \nthe catchment area of the very best primary school would have been associated with \nan additional 16.9 percent increase in its price.  \n \nApart from access to the Thames, where all the price increase was associated with \nhaving frontage to the river itself, other attributes for which the premium paid for the \n\u2017best\u2018 observed was particularly large, were closeness to the town centre, and space \u2013 \nboth inside houses and for garden space. Equally, there were some attributes for \nwhich the estimates showed a substantial proportion of the price variation was \nassociated with going from having the very \u2017worst\u2018 observed to something just a little \nbetter: neighbourhood deprivation was such an attribute. For this attribute going from \nthe most deprived ward to the 10\nth\n percentile place in the distribution of deprivation \nincreased the price proportionately more than going from the 90\nth\n percentile place to \nthe most affluent ward of all. Elaborate precautions were taken in the study to \nstandardise for all significant factors affecting local house prices including, of course, \nthe social and economic composition of the neighbourhood.  \n \nThese results are likely to reflect the pattern of preferences but they are also consistent \nwith the interpretation offered above. Attributes of houses, or amenities to which \nparticular houses give privileged access, which are in fixed or limited supply take on \nthe status of truly \u2015positional goods\u2016 that are auctioned off via the market for houses \nto the highest bidders. The ability to buy is determined not by absolute income but by \nincome relative to other households competing for the same goods. That school \nquality and private land and space consumption should exhibit this behaviour is \nconsistent with the argument presented above. Local governments act to constrain the \nsupply of land for housing and \u2013 no doubt unintentionally - the availability of the \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n25 \nhighest quality public goods15. An additional source of supply limitation may arise \nfrom \u2015peer group effects\u2016 and the preference of households to live in areas in which \nthey find their neighbours desirable or compatible. If richer and better educated \nneighbours, who spend more on their childrens\u2018 education, are perceived as desirable, \nthen the neighbourhoods in which they are concentrated are by definition limited in \nsupply and hence local neighbourhood quality becomes a positional good. In this way \nmany of the \u2015non-market\u2016 interactions that are an essential component of cities (as \npersuasively argued by Glaeser, 2001) are actually brought into a form of market \nallocation via the housing market.  \n \nThe house and neighbourhood characteristics allocated in the housing market include \nnot only the public goods themselves, but also risk and uncertainty concerning their \nlevels. As noted above, the measure of the past variation in the quality of a local \nschool was also reflected in the price paid for a given current level of measured \nquality.  Gibbons (2004) showed that neighbourhood crime \u2013 an indicator of real risk \n\u2013 was similarly reflected in house prices in London.  \n \nThe actual price paid for any attribute will depend on the characteristics of the local \nhousing market16 and economy since both these influence the supply and demand \ncharacteristics of individual attributes. For a given measure of income inequality the \nbest local school will cost substantially less in housing markets where average \nincomes are low than they will in high income housing markets because demand is \nincome elastic. In the higher income housing market people will be spending a higher \nproportion of their incomes trying to buy educational quality. If incomes become \nmore unequal over time (or in housing markets in which incomes are more unequally \ndistributed) then the price of attributes in fixed supply will rise and we should expect \nan even stricter sorting of households between nicer and more disadvantaged \nneighbourhoods. The best State schools become even more strictly reserved for the \nrichest local households (ignoring private education, access to which is explicitly \ndetermined by income not place of residence). \n \nThus, house prices are about much more fundamental economic and social issues than \ndinner party conversations might credit. The way in which the housing market works \nexplains an important part of the underlying differences in real welfare in society both \nvertically between households and across space; that is the patterns of spatial \nsegregation one observes in all cities. Many local public goods, funded from taxation \nand which we think of as naturally being provided on an equal basis to all households, \nare really much better thought of as being allocated through the housing market. \n                                                 \n15 That is not because they usually want there to be worse schools or public parks but because there can \nonly be one \u2017best\u2018 school or park. This is not the case with land supply which is intentionally restricted \nin order to implement urban containment policies. \n16 Including, of course, local policy. If access to schools is not determined by place of residence but by \nsome other mechanism, for example, by lot, or by selective examination, then there would be no price \npaid via the housing market. Consistent with this and demand for school quality being income elastic is \nthe estimated hedonic price of school quality in the Reading compared to the Darlington housing \nmarkets in 1993 and 1997 respectively. Again looking at the \u2017average\u2018 house, the price per GCSE point \nimprovement in Reading, where mean sampled incomes were \u00a328,610 pa, was \u00a3243.9 while in 1997, in \nDarlington, where mean incomes were \u00a323,422, it was \u00a330.8. However, since not only were incomes \nlower in Darlington but allocation to schools was less tightly tied to home address, we cannot be sure \nwhat the contribution of each factor separately was to the difference in the price of \u2017school quality\u2018 for \nthe mean home.  \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n26 \nConsumption of them is thus conditioned on household income in just the same way \nas consumption of foreign holidays, private education or personal security services is \nconditioned on income. But because the supply of many of them is more or less fixed \nwithin a particular urban area or housing market, income relative to others competing \nfor access to the same goods is the real determinant rather than the absolute level of \nincome itself. \n \nPricing the poor out of better neighbourhoods \nIf the preceding account is correct and income inequality is an important driver of \nresidential segregation, then changes in the distribution of income should lead to \nparallel changes in the distribution of house prices. If the rich become richer relative \nto the poor and so are more effectively able to outbid the poor to gain access to valued \nlocalised amenities and public goods, the supply of which is inelastic, then expensive \nhouses should become relatively more expensive compared to cheap ones.  \n \nData against which to test this are difficult to obtain. It ideally requires a series of \nsamples of house prices for a given housing market over time and matching data on \nincomes for households within that same housing market. Such data \u2013 at least for UK \nhousing markets \u2013 are not easily obtained but work done on the Reading housing \nmarket (reported in Cheshire and Sheppard various and Cheshire et al, 1999) does \nprovide such data for two different dates at least \u2013 1984 and 199317. The discussion \nbelow relates strictly to these two survey-based data sets except where noted. \n \nThere was a significant widening of income differentials in England and Wales as a \nwhole between 1984 and 1994. For example, the New Earnings Survey (NES) shows \nthe ratio of the gross earnings of a person at the 90th percentile point in the \ndistribution, relative to the mean as 1.54 in 1984 compared to 1.61 in 1994. The same \nsource shows earnings becoming significantly more unequal in Berkshire, with the \nsame ratio widening from 1.55 to 1.70. The NES, however, is not really a satisfactory \nsource for investigating the overall distribution of household incomes since very high \nearners are excluded from the survey and it relates just to the earnings of individuals. \nThe sample data for the Reading area has the great advantage of being precisely \nrelated to houses and the prices of those houses but it also has some disadvantages. It \nrelates to the joint gross incomes of households but only to those owner occupiers in \nthe sample from whom a survey was returned. Given that the survey was of occupiers \nof sampled houses for sale or recently sold, a significant proportion of which were \nvacant at the time of survey, the overall response rate of around 47 percent for each \nsurvey round was respectable. Thus, it differs from the NES in that it excludes \nincomes of renters who have lower incomes on average than owner occupiers but for \ncouples both incomes from all sources will be included in the reported household \ngross income, as will the incomes of the highest earners. Thus, we should expect the \nsurvey distribution to be substantially more unequal, however equality is represented, \nthan would be the case of the NES18.  \n \n                                                 \n17 The data set for 1999\/2000 did not contain household income. \n18 The NES excludes all the highest earners but they are included in the survey. Renters have lower \nincomes on average than owner occupiers but the variance of incomes in the lower tail of the overall \ndistribution is less than in the upper tail. While the survey undersamples low income households \nbecause it omits renters, it still includes some low income households, such as owner occupied \npensioner households. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n27 \nSince incomes were reported by quite large bands (over 20 percent of respondents in \nboth surveys were in the highest income band) representing the degree of equality or \ninequality by the ratio of the 90\nth\n percentile point to the mean is rather crude but for \ndirect comparison with the NES this ratio moved from 1.61 to 1.97 between 1984 and \n1993 \u2013 a substantially greater measured increase in income inequality. The Gini \ncoefficient may be a more subtle measure of the equality or inequality of a \ndistribution. If incomes for each household are interpolated using a standard \nprocedure19 then one can estimate a Gini co-efficient for the distribution at each date. \nThe value of that was 0.35 in 1984 but 0.53 in 1993: an indication of a very \nsubstantial increase in income inequality. \n \nTurning to the distribution of house prices, there is a parallel but smaller increase in \ndistributional inequality measured by the Gini co-efficient; this moved from 0.22 to \n0.28 between the two survey dates. Examining the (in)equality of the distribution of \nhouse prices (by comparing the ratio of the 90\nth\n percentile point to the mean) also \nshows an increase in house price inequality, with the more expensive houses \nbecoming relatively even more expensive between the two periods. The ratio \nincreased from 1.46 to 1.66 between 1984 and 1993. \n \nThis is far from conclusive evidence in support of the argument above since it is just \ntwo observations. Nothing of statistical significance can, therefore, be read into it. \nMoreover, conceptually one could argue that changes in the post tax distribution of \nincomes would be more relevant than gross incomes. Arguably, some measure of the \nquality of houses should also be included and this may have changed between 1984 \nand 1993. Nevertheless, what evidence is available is consistent with the hypothesis \nthat an increase in income inequality leads to a parallel increase in house price \ninequality as the relatively richer compete more successfully for access to the limited \nsupply of the \u2017best\u2018 houses in the \u2017best\u2018 neighbourhoods. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThis paper does not argue that \u2017neighbourhood effects\u2018 do not exist. While the \nevidence is overwhelming that poor people are priced into deprived neighbourhoods \nbecause they are poor, living in the most deprived neighbourhoods is almost by \ndefinition not a life enhancing experience. Because of peer group and role model \neffects, coupled simply with increased threats to health \u2013 even life20 \u2013 from accidents \nand crime, the experience may impair the life chances of those who live in them and \nespecially those of children raised in them. Before engaging in significant efforts and \nspending substantial resources to use policy to force neighbourhoods to be mixed, \nhowever, it seems essential to have a clear idea - if such neighbourhood effects exist - \nof how large they are and what benefits specialised, homogeneous neighbourhoods \nmay confer on both richer and poorer households.  \n \n                                                 \n19 Each income band in the survey is represented by a point interpolated applying a Pareto distribution \nto the overall data and each household in each income band is assigned the income at that point. \n20 Studies estimating neighbourhood effects by tracking cohorts of individuals over time, such as \nOreopoulos (2003) or Bolster et al (2007), since they only track survivors, may underestimate \nneighbourhood effects if being raised in the most deprived neighbourhoods increases death rates for \nyoung people compared to those the same young people would have experienced if raised in more \naffluent neighbourhoods. \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n28 \nThe evidence presented and surveyed here suggests that the benefits of specialised \nneighbourhoods are significant both in terms of finding suitable jobs and increasing \nthe range of choices available to people and the welfare they derive from living in \ncities. Despite major research efforts and expenditure \u2013 for example the US \nexperiment of the Moving to Opportunity programme \u2013 evidence of any significant \nadditional negative effects of living in deprived neighbourhoods (compared to the fact \nof poverty and the factors which tend to make someone poor in the first place) is very \nelusive. Evidence of positive externalities improving the welfare and lives of the poor \nas a result of having affluent neighbours is difficult to find. So long as \u2013 but always \nsubject to their income constraint - people choose the neighbourhoods in which they \nlive, unless there are such externalities, how can we justify policy interventions to \nforce people to move from where they have chosen to live? \n \nMoreover even if the existence of hard to find neighbourhood effects meant there \nwere some benefits from mixing communities, there are almost certainly costs too, \nand to judge the policy, it is the net gains, including the costs, that should be decisive. \nThe costs are likely to reflect the processes which underlie the persistence of \nneighbourhoods segregated along income lines because these would have to be \nreflected in the scale of resources needed to achieve neighbourhoods that are more \nmixed as a lasting element in our cities. The evidence suggests it is not just a one off \ncost that would need to be met but a continuing cost to prevent neighbourhoods \nunmixing again. \n \n The evidence reviewed here, particularly the most recent findings from cohort studies \nand the MTO project, does not support the conclusion that neighbourhood effects are \nquantitatively all that important nor that moving the poor to affluent neighbourhoods \non balance improves their welfare. However, we do know that the rich can always \noutbid the poor for nicer neighbourhoods because the desirable attributes of these \nneighbourhoods are fully reflected in the prices of houses within them. To the extent \nthat this is true, social segregation in cities must largely reflect economic inequality \nrather than causing it. Forcing neighbourhoods to be mixed in social and economic \nterms is, therefore, mainly treating the symptoms of inequality not the causes. It may \nmake decent people feel better but it does not address the problem. \n \nAt the same time there seem to be direct welfare benefits from living in specialised \nneighbourhoods with other complementary and similar households and probably \nproductivity benefits, too, because of better labour market networking and matching. \nThese seem to apply to poorer less skilled people as much as \u2013 even more than \u2013 the \nrich and educated. To the extent that these are significant, mixed neighbourhood \npolicies directly destroy a potential source of welfare and a portion of the \nconsumption and productivity benefits cities are capable of delivering. In addition, if \nLuttmer\u2018s (2005) findings generally apply and welfare falls as a person\u2018s income falls \nrelative to their neighbours\u2018, then that is an additional and persuasive reason why \nmixed neighbourhoods may reduce the welfare of poorer people. All these possible \nlosses need to be balanced against any benefits of reduced negative \u2017neighbourhood \neffects\u2018. \n \nAmongst the many things poor people buy less of is the amenities available from \nliving in affluent neighbourhoods.  Their poverty constrains them to consume less of \neverything. Food stamps may be paternalistic but at least we know that poor people \nPolicies for Mixed Communities: Faith-based Displacement Activity? \n \n29 \nbenefit from eating better (and having some extra income left over to spend on other \nthings). The problem is that there is scant evidence that the poor get any net benefits \nfrom being forced to live in more affluent neighbourhoods. They will have better local \namenities than they could otherwise afford but if they have any choice in where they \ncurrently live, the evidence of their location shows they valued other things more. \nThey lose the support of other families like themselves and local services tailored to \nthe needs of poorer people rather than the rich. Having a sympathetic small shop \nwithin walking distance which, though it may have high prices, stocks what you want \nand may give a bit of credit when you are most hard pressed, is a lot more useful to a \nstruggling single parent than being a short drive from a wholefood supermarket \ncatering for affluent professionals. \n \nThat the disadvantaged are concentrated in poor neighbourhoods does not \ndemonstrate that poor neighbourhoods are a cause of disadvantage. If that is the case, \nthe conclusion for policy is to reduce income inequality in society not build \u2017mixed \nneighbourhoods\u2018 or improve the built environment in such neighbourhoods. Mixed \nneighbourhood policies may divert attention from the need for effective income \nredistribution. Policies should help people and people who are effectively helped have \nan increased probability of moving away from the poor neighbourhoods in which they \ncurrently live. This, in turn, is likely to make the indicators for those poor \nneighbourhoods worse rather than better: but that does not mean that the policy was \nnot a success.  \n \nThe obverse of this is that if policies do not effectively address the underlying causes \nof poverty, improving the physical environment and amenities of deprived \nneighbourhoods may simply displace poorer people to even less attractive \nneighbourhoods, so the poorest have to bear disruption costs as well as poverty while \ncontinuing to live in a low quality built environment. These arguments do not, of \ncourse, imply that it is never useful to deliver policies aimed at reducing societal \ninequality in poor neighbourhoods (e.g. programmes to improve labour force skills or \nreduce crime).  It is in the poorest neighbourhoods that those who most need the help \nof people-targeted policies tend to be concentrated. \n \nReferences \nAffleck Greeves, T.
