Adults appreciate that pictures are public \nrepresentations that can communicate information to other people, and that some \npictures are better at doing this than others. We explore the foundations of this \nunderstanding in young children. In three experiments, using yes\/no and forced-choice \nquestions, we find that 3- and 4-year olds understand that other people benefit from \npictures that contain greater perceptual detail and that the more realistic the picture, the \nbetter it is as a symbolic vehicle.  \n \n \n3 \n \nDo young children know what makes a picture useful to other people? \nIn a classic article, Hochberg and Brooks (1962) described how they raised a \nchild without any access to visual representations, and then, when he was 19-months-\nold, showed him photographs and line-drawings of familiar objects and asked him to \nname them. He did so easily, suggesting that children do not need experience with \npictures in order to appreciate which objects they correspond to. Since then, several \nstudies have found that even younger children have some tacit appreciation of the \nrelationship between realistic representations and the objects they depict (DeLoache & \nBurns, 1994; Preissler & Carey, 2004; DeLoache, Pierroutsakos, & Troseth, 1996). \nOther studies find that preschool children can use the inferred intention of the artist to \nname pictures that do not resemble what they depict\u2014they appreciate, for instance, that \nif someone stares intently at a spoon while producing a scribble, that this scribble is \nlikely to represent the spoon (e.g., Bloom & Markson, 1998; Preissler & Bloom, 2008). \nThere is a critical distinction, however, between being able to recognize and \nname pictures versus actually understanding how pictures work.  Domestic chickens \nwill respond to a realistic two-dimensional picture of a chicken as if it were another \nchicken (Ryan, 1982), but surely chickens have no explicit grasp of the representational \nproperties of pictures. Even 3-month old human babies are able to perceive similarities \nbetween pictures and the real world, evidenced by the ability to recognize their mother\u2018s \nface in a color photograph (Barrera & Maurer, 1981).   However, this is far from \nshowing an understanding the symbolic and communicative nature of pictures.  In \ncontrast, as experienced viewers and creators of pictures, adults know a lot about \nrepresentations and how they work. We appreciate that pictures are public \n4 \nrepresentations that can communicate information to other people, and that some \npictures are better at doing this than others.  In addition, adults recognize that one\u2018s own \nknowledge of what a picture represents might differ from the knowledge of other \npeople. An artist who just completed an abstract painting of her lover, for instance, will \nbe entirely confident about what her painting represents, but will also realize that, in the \nabsence of other information, a stranger looking at it will have no idea. \n We are interested here in the question of whether young children have any \nappreciation of what makes some pictures more useful than others. There are reasons to \nexpect this to be difficult for children. DeLoache and her colleagues have discovered \nthat preschool children have problems coping with the \u2015dual nature\u2016 of \nrepresentations\u2014the fact that they are both symbolic entities and concrete material \nthings.  This makes it difficult for them to use representations in certain ways, such as \nfinding the location of a hidden object (e.g., DeLoache & Burns, 1994; DeLoache, \nMiller, and Rosengren, 1997; see also Preissler & Bloom, 2007). Other researchers find \nthat preschool children often have problems reasoning about pictures independently of \nthe objects that they represent; they sometimes say \u2015yes\u2016 when shown a picture and \nasked, \u2015Can you eat this picture of an apple\u2016, and they sometimes agree that if you get \nclose enough to a picture of a rose, you can smell it (Beilin and Pearlman, 1991; \nThomas, Nye, and Robinson, 1994).  In addition, children of this age tend to have a \nbroad conception of what constitutes a picture, and include letters and numbers as \nacceptable pictures, in addition to drawings (Thomas, Nye, Rowley & Robinson, 2001).  \nFinally, there might be special difficulties in children\u2018s understanding that others might \nnot recognize a picture that they themselves recognize, since, in general, children tend \n5 \ntoward egocentrism\u2014they are highly vulnerable to the so-called \u2017curse of knowledge\u2018 \n(see Birch & Bloom, 2003).  \nHere we address these issues through use of simple yes\/no and forced-choice \nquestions. In Experiment 1, we explore whether children believe that a detailed picture \nmakes a better symbol than a less detailed one, even if both could depict the same \nreferent.  Experiment 2 investigates whether a simple preference for detailed pictures by \nyoung children could be responsible for the results of Experiment 1.   Finally, \nExperiment 3 investigates children\u2018s expectations of how other people interpret \ndrawings.  \n \nExperiment 1 \n \nIn Experiment 1 we provide children with two plausible depictions of a referent, \nand varied the level of perceptual detail, to examine whether children think that more \ndetailed drawings are better for conveying information to other people than vague \nrenderings.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants  \nSixteen children (mean age 4.0 years; range 3.2 \u2013 4.6 years) recruited from the \nUnitots nursery at the University of Edinburgh were included in the study.  There were \n7 males and 9 females.   \nMaterials  \n6 \n Eight pre-drawn pictures of familiar entities were used in the study.  For each \ntrial, two pictures depicted the same referent, however one was detailed and one was \nvague (see Figure 1).  The stimuli included pairs depicting a house,  dog, car, and the \nexperimenter. \n-Insert Figure 1 about here- \nProcedure \nChildren were seated at a table across from the experimenter.  Each participant \nwas presented with 4 pairs of pictures, 2 per trial.  Both members of the pair could \ndepict a particular referent (such as a house), however one was a simple, relatively \nvague drawing, and the other a more detailed artist\u2018s rendering.  Children were \npresented with each member of the pair randomly, and asked for each: \u2015If we showed \nthis to Anna (the nursery coordinator), would she know what it is a picture of?\u2016  Then \nthey were asked \u2015which picture should we show your Mum so she knows what the X \nlooks like?\u2016   During pilot testing, adult participants selected the more detailed picture \nwhen asked which picture should be shown to someone else so they know what the X \nlooks like.  We interpret this as understanding that the detailed picture is a better source \nof information to show to someone else, which guided our subsequent hypotheses for \nthe child participants. \n \nResults & Discussion \n \nWhen asked if another person would know what the detailed drawing was a \npicture of, 95% indicated \u2017yes\u2018, whereas only 23% agreed that a person would know the \nidentity of the less detailed depiction (McNemar\u2018s test, \uf0632=31.1, p<.01, d.f.=1).  When \n7 \nasked, \u2015Which picture should we show your Mum so she knows what the X looks \nlike?\u2016, children selected the more detailed depiction 78% overall\u2014binomial p (two-\ntailed) < .0001).  Taken together, these results suggest that children understand that \nother people benefit from detailed information when linking a picture to its referent.    \nHowever, an alternative explanation is that children simply prefer more detailed \npictures to simpler depictions, and are answering in accord with their own preferences \ninstead of considering the actual information depicted in the pictures.  Experiment 2 \nexplores this possibility. \n \nExperiment 2 \n In Experiment 2, we present a different sample of children with pictures varying \nboth in detail and content (2 different superordinate levels within a given kind \ncategory).  This experiment will examine if children have a default preference for \ndetailed drawings when asked to choose between the two types of pictures. \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwenty native English-speaking children (mean age 4.2 years; range 3.0 to 4.9 \nyears) recruited from the Unitots nursery at the University of Edinburgh and the Human \nDevelopment Centre at Lancaster University were included in the study.  Twelve males \nand 8 females participated. \nMaterials  \nThe stimuli consisted of eight drawings (2 per trial).   The drawings were simple \nfigures, with one of each pair depicting a detailed, non-prototypical example of a \ncategory such as \u2017house\u2018 (e.g. Japanese style house) and the other showing a less \n8 \ndetailed, but prototypical exemplar (a standard western style house).   The stimuli set \nalso included pairs of pictures representing a cat (lioness and tabby cat), bird (penguin \nand cardinal) and fish (stingray and goldfish).  The first member of each pair was a \ndetailed rendering and the second member of each pair was less detailed (but \nprototypical of the kind category).   A pre-test was comprised of those 8 drawings and \n16 additional drawings (See Figure 2). \n- Insert Figure 2 about here \u2013 \nProcedure \nParticipants were seated at a small table across from the experimenter.  In order \nto determine that children believed that both examples of the picture pairs to be used in \nthe test trials were indeed members of the same category, a pre-test was administered.  \nDuring this pre-test, children were shown all items from the test trials, presented in pairs \n(one prototypical example and one non-prototypical example of the same category), \nalong with 2 additional distracter drawings per trial.  Children were asked to show the \nexperimenter, for instance, all the \u2017houses\u2018 from the array.  Filler trials were added so \nthat the correct response was sometimes one picture, sometimes 2 pictures, and \nsometimes 3 pictures, hence the children could not discern a pattern of 2 correct \npictures. Only pairs of pictures which \u2017passed\u2018 this pre-test were then used in the test \nphase, hence children individually received from 1-4 test trials tailored to their pre-test \nresponses.  Thus, the only items to be used in the test trials were ones in which both \nmembers of the pair were considered to be members of the same kind category (56 trials \noverall).   \nIn the test trials, which followed immediately, children were presented with each \npair of pictures and were told:   \u2015My friend Daxi has been living in a faraway land and \n9 \nhe doesn\u2019t know what a lot of things here in England\/Scotland look like.  Can we help \nhim?  Let\u2019s help Daxi learn what things here look like.\u201d  They were then asked, \u201cWhich \npicture should we show to Daxi so he knows what a (bird\/house\/cat\/fish) looks like?\u201d \n \nResults & Discussion \nOverall, children selected the less detailed (but more prototypical) picture on \n48\/56 (85.7%) of the test trials, a highly significant difference from a chance level of \n50% as measured by an independent t-test (p<.001, t(19)=4.3, d=.83). \nThese results show that children do not simply have a bias for selecting more \ndetailed pictures instead of less detailed ones.  Rather, children are taking into account \nthe kind of information the picture contains, and thus have a fairly sophisticated \nunderstanding that other people may benefit best from a less detailed picture if it \ncontains more relevant information.  Experiment 3 investigates whether this hypothesis \nholds when the picture which is the best source of information conflicts with a child\u2018s \nown knowledge of an artist\u2018s intentional state. \n \nExperiment 3 \n \nExperiment 3 explores whether children understand that even though they \nthemselves know what the picture is intended to represent, other viewers might not.    \nChildren of this age often behave egocentrically, showing a \u2017curse of knowledge\u2018 bias, \nwhich manifests itself by influencing how they interpret other people\u2018s behavior and \nexpectations (Birch & Bloom, 2003).  Here we examine whether children can override \nsuch a bias when reasoning about the communicative nature of pictures.  More \n10 \nspecifically, do children understand that even though they know what a picture \nrepresents, other people may not share this knowledge? \n \nMethod \nParticipants.   \nTwenty-five children (mean age 4.1 years; range 3.3 \u2013 4.8 years) recruited from \nthe Unitots nursery at the University of Edinburgh and the local Edinburgh community \nwere included in the study.  There were 12 males and 13 females.   \nMaterials.  \n Twelve pre-drawn pictures and four novel objects were used in the study (see \nFigure 3).  The drawings included 4 pictures which represented each of the target novel \nobjects in detail, 4 vague pictures \u2017drawn\u2018 by the experimenter to represent each of the \ntarget novel objects, and 4 detailed distractor pictures which did not resemble any of the \ntarget objects. \nProcedure \nChildren were each shown an opaque bag, and told:  \u2015My friend Lucy found \nsome toys and pictures, and she put them in this bag for us to look at.  They are things \nwe have never seen before!\u2016  There were four trials. In each trial, the experimenter \nselected one object from the bag, reminded the child she has never seen the item before, \nand named it with a novel word (e.g. \u2015let\u2018s call this a dax!\u2016).  The experimenter then \ntold the child that she was going to \u2017draw a picture of the dax!\u2018, and she picked up a \nclipboard and oriented a piece of paper on it.  She pretended to draw a picture of the \nobject (which was actually pre-drawn).  This picture crudely resembled the object.  \n11 \nChildren were then asked if they wanted to see the experimenter\u2018s \u2017picture of the dax\u2018, \nand it was then placed on the table for inspection.   \nThe experimenter then said to the child, \u2015Let\u2018s look at some of the pictures Lucy \nleft for me.  Remember we have never seen them before!\u2016  The experimenter removed \ntwo pictures from the bag (one detailed drawing which resembled the dax, and one \ndistracter drawing), and placed them on the table next to the experimenter\u2018s drawing of \nthe dax. \nChildren were then asked: \u2015My friend John has never seen a dax before!  Which \npicture should we give him so he knows what it looks like?\u2016 They were also asked to \nindicate, out of the array of 3 pictures, which picture was drawn by the experimenter.  \nFinally, children were asked to label the experimenter\u2018s picture.   \n \nResults & Discussion \n \nWhen asked for a picture to give to John so that he might know what the object \nlooks like, children selected the picture the experimenter drew 19% of the time, the \npicture which clearly resembled the object 79% and the distracter picture 2% \n(McNemar\u2018s test, \uf0632=51.3, p.001, d.f.=2).  \nWhen asked to indicate the picture that the experimenter drew, they selected the \ncorrect picture 85%, the picture which resembled the target object 15%, and never \nindicated the distracter object. The question of what the experimenter's picture \nrepresented was more difficult; some children did not answer (37%), and others said \nthat they did not know (30%).  When children did respond, however, it was usually by \nnaming or pointing to the dax (70% of all responses). \n12 \nWe were surprised that so few children were able to identify the experimenter\u2018s \npicture, given that 2-year-olds succeed on a similar task (Preissler & Bloom, 2008). It \nmight be that the referential cues in this current study were not salient enough for \nchildren to realize what the experimenter was intending to draw.  Another possibility is \nthat some children did not remember the label after the brief delay. Alternatively, \nchildren may have been hindered by the order of the questions. After having picked out \nanother picture as the best referent of the object, they perhaps felt that they would be \ncontradicting themselves if they said that the experimenter also drew a picture of that \nsame object.   \nHowever, there were enough children who correctly stated that the \nexperimenter\u2018s picture is of the dax to ask whether these children were biased by this \nknowledge when choosing a picture for someone else. More specifically, when children \nare themselves aware that a vague picture depicts an object, do they then believe that \nothers would benefit from being shown that picture? As predicted, they do not; an \nanalysis of just those trials in which the children correctly identified the experimenter\u2018s \npicture found that these children still tended to choose the detailed picture (81%; \nbinomial p (two-tailed) < .007 as compared to chance). \n \nGeneral Discussion \n \nPictures are an important source of conveying information, but to serve this \npurpose, they have to be understandable to other people. These three studies suggest \nthat 3- and 4-year-olds have some understanding of what makes a picture useful as a \nsymbolic tool. Experiment 1 found that children believe that the more realistic a picture, \n13 \nthe better, however Experiment 2 showed that children aren\u2018t simply biased towards \ndetailed pictures.  Rather, they pay attention to the content of the picture and use that \ninformation to decide what picture another person would best benefit from.  Experiment \n3 also found that when children see a relatively crude picture of an object being drawn \n(which they believe represents the object), they appreciate that a different more realistic \npicture is more useful to another person.   \nHow do children come to know this about pictures? One proposal is that it might \nbe an inference based on the child\u2018s own experience. It might be, for instance, that \nchildren notice that they themselves would find some of these drawings harder to \nrecognize than others and infer that this would hold true for other people.  \nThis leads to a proposal about younger children and their own drawings.  One \nand 2-year-old children will create scribbles and name them\u2014for instance, they might \ncall a certain scribble \u2015Mommy\u2016 or \u2015airplane\u2016 (Bloom, 2000; Cox, 1992). Perhaps even \nthese very early acts of naming are rooted in a sophisticated understanding of other \npeople\u2018s grasp of pictures. In particular, children might be eager to name their pictures \nbecause they know that these pictures do not resemble their referents, and hence, \nwithout the name, other people would not be able to tell what they are.  \nIn sum, we have explored here the developing understanding that pictures are \npublic representations that can communicate information to other people, and that some \npictures are better at doing this than others. There is a lot more to knowing how pictures \nwork, of course, but this foundation at least appears to be in place in preschool children. \n \n \n14 \nReferences \nBarrera, M.E.,  & Maurer, D.
