INTRODUCTION \nTypically, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system is configured using an in-fibre Michelson \ninterferometer1, with a reference reflector in one interferometer arm, and the sample in the other. However, the \nstability of this commonly-used arrangement is environmentally sensitive. Variations in the deployment of the \ninterferometer fibres cause polarization-state changes which are different for the two arms. Signal fading therefore \noccurs, reducing the amplitude of the fringes2. This is not a severe problem if the sensitivity drift is slow, since the \nvisibility value will exceed 0.5 during about 70% of the measurement time. However, polarization changes within \nthe duration of an A-scan, such as might be experienced during endoscopic manipulation, are more of a problem. \nVariations on this timescale can introduce artefacts into the OCT image, in the form of spurious interfaces or regions \nof missing data3. The use of a Fizeau interferometer, as shown for a time-domain configuration in figure 1, \neliminates polarisation fading problems, since the reference and signal beams travel in the same fibre. A Fizeau-type \nOCT system using lock-in detection was originally reported by Bamford4, and alternative configurations \nsubsequently investigated 5, 6. Several other groups have recently reported investigations of common-path \nconfigurations 7, 8.  \nIn a Fizeau-type OCT system, the reference reflection is derived either from a glass plate positioned close \nto the sample or, preferably, from the reflection at the end of the delivery fibre. This removes the requirement to \nsuppress the fibre end reflection. The selected reference reflectivity affects system sensitivity. The usual 4% fibre \nend reflectivity is quite appropriate for typical reflectivities expected from biological samples but, if required, the \nfibre end can be coated with titanium dioxide to increase the reflectivity up to a value of around 30% 9. The \nreference and signal beams traverse a common path within the optical fibre section of the interferometer, \nexperiencing identical phase\/polarisation perturbations. The state of polarisation for both beams is matched at all \npositions, and the visibility of any interference seen at the detector is maintained at the maximum for the system. \nCoherence Domain Optical Methods and Optical Coherence Tomography in Biomedicine XII,\nedited by Joseph A.

A Michelson-type \nprocessing interferometer is shown in figure 1. \nThe sensitivity of the system is defined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which affects the depth-\ndependent contrast seen in the OCT images, and therefore both the maximum depth at which acceptable imaging can \nbe achieved and the minimum change in refractive index that can be detected. SNR is typically lower in Fizeau-type \nOCT systems than in those based on Michelson interferometers, because there is a larger dc background, resulting \nfrom light that does not participate in the interference process 10. The excess noise term arising from this cannot be \ncancelled using balanced detection, because the noise on the two complementary outputs from the Mach-Zehnder \ninterferometer is out of phase, as is the ac signal term7. \nHowever, there are advantages to the Fizeau approach. The fibre end reflection, which in a Michelson-type \nOCT system is a source of noise, is now used instead as the system reference beam. The \u2018downlead insensitivity\u2019, \nconferred by the common-path arrangement in the probe arm, maintains the SNR at its maximum possible value and \nin some situations prevents the occurrence of polarisation-fading artefacts in OCT images. In the more typically-\nused Michelson OCT configuration, recoupling into single-mode fibre must be achieved from a scanned reference \nbeam, which can be awkward. The Fizeau configuration avoids reference beam recoupling. \n \n Sensing Fizeau Interferometer \nSLD \nsource \nDirectional \ncoupler \nLens \nPath-length \nscanning \nBeam \nsplitter\nMirror \nMichelson processing interferometer \nSample \n \n \nFig. 1. Configuration for Fizeau configuration OCT system with a Michelson processing interferometer.  \n \nIn OCT, 3D imaging is generally achieved by scanning the probe beam across the surface of the sample in a \nraster pattern, acquiring an A-scan at each position and providing images of 1-30\u00b5m resolution 11 at imaging depths \nof 1-2mm 12. Currently, to implement this technique, active scanning components are required at the probe tip. This \nis relatively straightforward in a bulk-optic system, but more difficult in a fibre-optic endoscope probe, where \nminiaturized scanning components are necessary 13, 14, 15. In this paper we discuss how the incorporation of a \ncoherent imaging bundle, in a Fizeau based interferometer configuration, can allow a \u2018downlead insensitive\u2019 OCT \nprobe to be designed, with the elimination of scanning mechanical parts from the probe. \nWe have previously demonstrated an OCT probe incorporating an imaging fibre bundle, in which all fibres \nof the bundle were illuminated simultaneously, with a CCD camera used for image capture 16. The present paper \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6847  68470C-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79.

This system enables point detectors to be used instead of a \ncamera, allowing high-bandwidth noise filtering techniques to be applied to the detector output. \nImaging bundles have been used successfully for OCT in a Michelson configuration. However, the state of \npolarization of light varies considerably for light in different fibres of the bundle which, at any one time, will result \nin non-optimal interference signals for many of the fibres, as shown in figure 2.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360\nPolariser azimuth \/ degrees\nIn\nte\nns\nity\n \/ \nar\nbi\nta\nry\n u\nni\nts\n \nFig. 2. Plot of intensity variation in the output from three individual fibres of the bundle, as a polarizer is rotated at the output, \nshowing that the state of polarization differs between fibres. \n \nIt is not easy to see how the polarization of light in each individual fibre can be manipulated. However, in \nthe Fizeau configuration, the bundle does not form part of either interferometer; therefore the instrument is \n\u201cdownlead insensitive\u201d 18. \n \n2.  EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM BASED ON A FIZEAU CONFIGURATION \nIn our experimental arrangement, shown in figure 3, the coupler was replaced by a polarisation-independent \noptical circulator, which greatly increases the optical efficiency. The source was a pigtailed super-luminescent diode \n(Covega) centred at 1550 nm, with a full-width half maximum (FWHM) of 55 nm, and an output power of 9.5 mW \nfollowing the fibre pigtail. Light from the source is routed through the circulator from one port to the next, with a \nconsequent transfer loss of only a few percent. Thus, neglecting losses, all light from the broadband source is \ndelivered by the optical circulator to the Fizeau sensing interferometer. An optical power of 7.6 mW was measured \nonto the sample. Both the fibre end-reflection and the back-scattered light from the sample are then directed to the \nbulk-optic Mach-Zehnder balancing interferometer, where the light is collimated using a fibre-connected GRIN lens \nand then amplitude-divided by a plate beam splitter. Plate beam splitters are used in the bulk-optic part of the system \nbecause their polarisation sensitivity is lower than that of cube beam splitters. One surface of each beam splitter is \nanti-reflection coated to prevent \u201cghosting\u201d. In one arm of the interferometer, a glass 45o prism is mounted on a \ncomputer-controlled translation stage, which allows both adjustment of the gross path length difference, to match \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6847  68470C-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\n  \nthat in the Fizeau interferometer, and high-resolution A-scanning. The beam offset introduced by the prism allows \nall the retro-reflected light to continue through the interferometer, and thus minimises losses. A second 45o prism \nacts as a reflector in the other interferometer arm. In principle, only one of the interferometer arms need include a \nprism, but the symmetrical arrangement using two prisms is better for minimisation of dispersion effects. There is an \noverall loss of 50% in the processing interferometer. \nThe two interferometer beams recombine at the second beam splitter. The signal is acquired by an InGaAs \nphotodetector and digitised using a 200,000 samples s-1, 16-bit A\/D card housed within a PC. An A-scan obtained \nusing a mirror in the sample arm produces a coherence function with a FWHM value of 19 \u00b5m in air, or about 13 \u00b5m \nin a typical biological sample. This defines the longitudinal resolution of the system. The PI translation stage used \nhas a maximum scanning speed of 1.7 mm s-1, and is controlled by means of a LabviewTM program. \n \n \n \nBroadband \nSource\nB\nA\nOC\nBS\nBS\nM\nM\ncc\ncc\nMS\nSProbe\nFizeau scanning interferometer\nProcessing Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer\nBalanced \ndetector Computer\nGRIN lens\nPro\nC\nBoundary\nDetector\n \nFig. 3.

OC = optical circulator, \nS = sample, BS = beam splitter, M = mirror, CC = corner cube prism, MS = micropositioning stage. \n \nThe probe-end focusing head comprises a pair of lenses of focal lengths 20 and 40 mm respectively, giving \na theoretical beam waist of about 23 \u00b5m in air, and a Rayleigh range of around 540 \u00b5m. Scanning can typically be \nperformed through about three Rayleigh ranges, centred on the position of best focus, without severe loss of SNR or \nspatial resolution. Therefore, for this system, the accessible depth as defined by the Rayleigh range is about 1.5-2 \nmm. In a high-index medium, the beam waist and the Rayleigh range are increased; for a material of index 1.5, the \nobserved performance of this system is expected to be reasonably constant within a sample depth range of about 3 \nmm. \n \n2.1 Tests using oils of calibrated refractive index  \nThe sensitivity of the system was assessed using Cargille oils of extremely well calibrated refractive index, \ndeposited on a glass microscope slide of 1 mm thickness. Measurements were performed with the OCT probe \nmounted vertically, as shown in figure 4. A cylindrical collar, adjustable in height, was fixed around the probe end \nsuch that the upper end of the cylinder could be positioned at the best focus distance from the lenses and used as a \nplatform for mounting the oil samples (figure 4). This provided a repeatable measurement system, where the \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6847  68470C-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79.

For normal incidence, the reflectivity equation simplifies to \n \n2\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n\u2212=\noilglass\noilglass\nnn\nnn\nR\n      (1) \n \nThus the reflectivity of an interface can be calculated. For the microscope slide, the RI was calculated from \nthe ratio of optical thickness, measured using the OCT system as 1.5211 mm, to the actual physical thickness, \nmeasured using vernier calipers as 0.999 mm. This yielded a RI of 1.523 (\u00b10.01) at 1550 nm. For the Cargille oils \nused, the RI was quoted at 588.3 nm, and was converted to 1550 nm in each case using the Cauchy equation \nprovided with the bottles. The RI values obtained at 1550 nm were generally about 0.01 lower than the quoted \nvalues at 588.3 nm, and the accuracy of the calculated value at 1550 nm was about 0.007 according to manufacturer \nspecifications. \n \nL2\nL1\nf 2\nMicroscope\ncover slide\nProbe\nAluminium \nblock\nRefractive \nindex oil\n \nFig 4.

The distance f2 \ncorresponds to the focal length of the second lens in the probe head. \n \nThe lower surface of the cover slip acts as a useful reference surface for the measurements, since the OCT \npeak obtained for this glass\/air interface should be the same on each occasion. The sample position was set by \nplacing a cover slip on the platform, and adjusting the mount position until the OCT signals received for the upper \nand lower surfaces of the slip were of approximately equal intensity. Measurements were then made for a series of \noils with indices ranging from 1.400-1.600. The total reflected power was assumed to result from the sum of \nreflections at the air\/glass and glass\/oil interfaces. The oil\/air interface is more than one Rayleigh range from best \nfocus and its contribution to the total reflected signal is small. \nFor each of the oils, the SNR of the glass\/oil signal peak was assessed. This was obtained from the ratio of \nthe peak amplitude to the standard deviation of the noise amplitude. \n \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\nnoise\noilglass\noilglass\nA\nSNR \u03c3\n\/\n10\/ log20\n     (2) \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6847  68470C-5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79.

The smallest index difference measured in this experiment was about 0.01, which \nresulted in an SNR of 35.5 dB measured directly from the detector output, or 64.5 dB when software filtering was \napplied.  \nDifferences in RI between regions within a biological sample tend to be in the second or third decimal \nplace. The results from the oil measurements suggest that the SNR obtained from our system is sufficient for good-\nquality imaging from samples with this level of RI variation.  \nThis system used time-domain processing, but it would also be possible to operate the system as a Fourier-\ndomain instrument17 by fixing the path-length in the processing interferometer and dispersing the output signal onto \na spectrometer. This inevitably leads to a relatively large dc background, and it would be preferable to dispense with \nthe processing interferometer altogether. However, the path-length inherent to the Fizeau interferometer is too large \nto allow for Fourier-domain operation in this mode, unless an external reflector is used to generate the reference \nreflection8. \n \n \n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n1.41 1.42 1.43 1.44 1.45 1.46 1.47 1.48 1.49 1.5 1.51 1.52 1.53 1.54 1.55 1.56 1.57\nRefractive index at 1550 nm\nSN\nR\nR\nefractive index of glass slide\n \nFig. 5.

FIZEAU INTERFEROMETER CONFIGURATION USING COHERENT IMAGING FIBRE \nBUNDLES \nThe experimental arrangement for the OCT system is described below. It is a bundle-based analogue of the \nsingle-point version.

Fizeau based OCT incorporating a coherent imaging fibre optic bundle. \n \nThe collimated beam is focused onto the input face of the bundle, by means of a second aspheric lens \nproviding a focused beam diameter of 4.4\u00b5m. The input end of the bundle was polished at an angle of 8 degrees to \navoid any back reflection to the processing interferometer. The length of the bundle was 1.1m and was comprised 15 \n000 fibres. Each fibre in turn was addressed by the focused input beam. The beam is transmitted through the bundle \nand is focused onto the sample by the probe lenses, also comprising appropriate aspherics. The sample beam is \nfocused with a beam diameter of about 8.2\u00b5m and a Rayleigh range of about 250\u00b5m. The Fizeau interferometer is \nformed between reflected light from the distal end of a fibre in the bundle (forming the reference arm) and light \nreflected by the sample itself (forming the sample arm). Since an inherent path length mismatch is present, a \nprocessing interferometer is required either in the form of a Michelson or Mach-Zehnder. A bulk-optic processing \ninterferometer is preferred to avoid reintroducing polarization problems and to minimize dispersion. To address each \nfibre in the bundle in succession, the bundle was mounted onto a computer controlled mechanical translation stage, \nwhich was scanned across the focused input beam. Two coherent fibre optic imaging bundles used were tested which \nwere provided by Schott North America. The packing arrangement of fibres in the bundle, as shown in figure 7, can \nbe either a regular hexagonal pattern for leached bundles, or an arrangement of square packed 5x5 sub-bundles for \nwound bundles, with fibre centre spacings of 10\u00b5m and core diameters of 8\u00b5m.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 7.

We \nhave investigated this by coupling light into a single fibre and observing the output on a camera. At 800nm, leakage \nbetween neighbouring fibres was found to be negligible although, working with a wavelength of 1550nm, crosstalk \nwas more significant.  \nThe combination of coupling\/transmission efficiency at 800nm was measured to be 45%. Coupling loss is \nlow, due to the fact that the fibre bundles have high NA (NA=0.55) values and a mismatch is present with the \nexternal coupling optics. However, this leads to a significant optical power loss for returning beams. At 1550nm the \ncoupling\/transmission efficiency was measured to be about 20%. This is consistent with a higher mode field \ndiameter and consequent leakage into neighboring fibres. Therefore a careful lens design is required at both input \nand output coupling system of lenses. The relatively large fibre diameter can lead to slight multi-moding of light in \neach fibre at 800nm under certain launching conditions. The effect of multi-moding in the bundle would be that \n\u2018ghost\u2019 images would arise due to the different path length corresponding to each mode. This has not, however, been \na problem in our experiments, and is even less probable at higher wavelengths having a larger mode field diameter. \nPictures obtained by scanning the input beam across 3 individual fibres in succession are presented in figure 8a, \ntogether with a coherence envelope for one fibre in figure 8b. \n \n \nFig. 8. a) 3 fibres illuminated in sequence, by scanning of the input beam. b) Coherence envelope using mirror as sample. \n                    a)                                                                                                          b) \nScanning \ndirection 10\u00b5m step  \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6847  68470C-8\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79.

CONCLUSION \nA Fizeau configuration optical coherence tomography system has been developed, offering transverse and \nlongitudinal spatial resolutions of around 20 \u00b5m. An SNR of 80 dB has been obtained from a mirror surface, and a \nseries of oils of known index, deposited on glass, have been used to assess the SNR for interfaces of lower \nreflectivity. Implementation of a coherent fibre imaging bundle can enable 2D information to be obtained without \nthe necessity for scanning components at the probe tip. The common path probe section of the instrument ensures \n\u2018downlead insensitivity\u2019 and, provided that the processing interferometer is constructed in bulk-optic form, the entire \ninstrument is polarization insensitive. The use of an imaging bundle in a Fizeau interferometer based OCT would \noverall be advantageous as it will form an extremely compact, robust and downlead insensitive instrument for future \nendoscopic applications allowing 3D OCT image acquisition. Further development of the system will include testing \non biological samples, miniaturisation of components, increased transverse scanning speed of the input beam across \nthe bundle and its implementation in the Fourier domain rather than time domain. \nREFERENCES \n1.
