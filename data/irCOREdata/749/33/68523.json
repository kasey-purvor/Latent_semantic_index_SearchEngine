Lett. A 180, 332-336 (1993).\nThe phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR), where a periodic signal in a system\nand the signal-to-noise ratio are enhanced by external noise, has attracted much attention\nrecently and by now has been observed in several physical systems (see [1] and references\ntherein). The occurrence of SR is related to the nonlinearity of a system. At the same\ntime, for small enough amplitude A of the periodic force causing a signal, the amplitude\nof the signal is proportional to A, and therefore many aspects of SR can conveniently and\neffectively be analysed [2-6] in terms of standard linear response theory (LRT) [7]. The\nLRT analysis amounts to finding the susceptibility of the system \u03c7(\u2126) and its dependence\non the noise intensity D and on the frequency \u2126 of the force. The susceptibility is defined\nin a standard way [7] as the coefficient of proportionality between the periodic term in the\nensemble-averaged value of the coordinate \u03b4\u3008q(t)\u3009 (the signal) and the force A exp(\u2212i\u2126t),\n\u03b4\u3008q(t)\u3009 = \u03c7(\u2126)A exp(\u2212i\u2126t) (1)\n(in the case of a nonstationary system the definition (1) has to be modified). The am-\nplitude of the signal is equal to |\u03c7(\u2126)|A, and SR arises when |\u03c7(\u2126)| increases with D in\nsome interval of D (and then decreases again for higher D, so that the dependence on\nnoise intensity is of the form of a resonant curve, thus justifying the term \u201cstochastic\nresonance\u201d).\nThe LRT formulation is not confined to particular systems or particular types of noise\nand, indeed, was used to predict and observe SR [4, 6] in systems drastically different\nfrom that performing Brownian motion in a symmetric double-well potential which is\nusually considered as the prototype of SR-displaying systems [1]. One of the advantageous\nfeatures of this formulation is that, in the case of systems at thermal equilibrium or quasi-\nequilibrium (in which case it is temperature T that corresponds to the noise intensity D),\nthe susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126) is related, via the fluctuation-dissipation relations, to the spectral\ndensity of fluctuations (SDF) of the coordinate q(t) [7]. Therefore, if the SDF is known\nfrom the experimental data, it is straightforward to predict whether the system will or\nwill not display SR when driven by a force of a given frequency even without establishing\nthe underlying physical mechanism; we note that the corresponding analysis does not\nassume that the system is Markovian or whatever - the only thing assumed is that it is\nin thermal equilibrium.\nThe theoretical evaluation of the susceptibility for some simple model noise-driven\nsystems that display SR, and for systems performing Brownian motion in a double-well\npotential in particular, has been done in Refs. [2 - 6]. The analysis of bistable systems\ncould be done for small noise intensities where there are two strongly different time scales\nthat characterize the motion of a system: the relaxation time tr over which the system\napproaches a stable state (the longest of these times), and the reciprocal probabilities\nW\u22121nm of fluctuational transitions n\u2192 m (n,m = 1, 2) between the states,\nWtr \u226a 1, W =W12 +W21 (2)\nTwo approaches have been used. The first of these [2, 3] is based on the idea that, for low\nnoise intensities, a system spends most of its time localized close to the stable states, and\nonly occasionally do there occur fluctuational transitions between the states; therefore the\nsusceptibility is a sum of the partial susceptibilities \u03c7n(\u2126) from small-amplitude vibrations\nabout the stable positions qn (n = 1, 2), weighted with the populations wn of the stable\nstates, and of the susceptibility related to the fluctuational transitions, \u03c7tr(\u2126), which\n2\ndescribes the effect of the modulation of the transition probabilities and hence of the\npopulations of the stable states by a periodic force (cf. [8]):\n\u03c7(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nn=1,2\nwn\u03c7n(\u2126) + \u03c7tr(\u2126), wn = Wmn\/W (3)\nThe evaluation of \u03c7n reduces to the solution of a linearized problem, and the explicit\nexpression for \u03c7tr has been obtained for systems driven by Gaussian noise in the range\n\u2126tr \u226a 1 (\u03c7tr \u221d W\/\u2126 for W \u226a \u2126, cf. Eq.(18) below, and it becomes very small for\n\u2126tr \u223c 1 in the range (2)).\nA different approach has been suggested in Ref.5 for the analysis of overdamped Brow-\nnian motion in a symmetrical bistable potential U(q),\nq\u02d9 + U \u2032(q) = f(t), \u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032) (4)\nThe basic idea of this approach is to reduce the Fokker-Planck equation\n\u2202P (q, t)\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202(U \u2032(q)P (q, t))\n\u2202q\n+D\n\u22022P (q, t)\n\u2202q2\n(5)\nthat corresponds to the Langevin equation (4) to an eigenvalue problem and to express\nthe susceptibility in terms of the matrix elements of the coordinate q on the corresponding\neigenfunctions. It was then possible to evaluate the susceptibility explicitly in the range of\nnoise intensities D where (2) holds. A systematic perturbation theory in the amplitude of\na sinusoidal force has been developed for systems described by the Fokker-Planck equation\nand applied to SR in an effectively two-state approximation in Ref [9].\nThe purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that the two approaches [2, 3]\nand [5] give identical results and to generalize the approach [5] to the case of an arbitrary\ndouble-well potential U(q).\nThe reduction of Eq.(5) to a Hermitian eigenvalue problem is standard [10, 11]: one\nseeks the solution in the form\nP (q, t) = Z\u22121\/2 exp(\u2212U(q)\/2D)\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\n|j\u3009 exp(\u2212\u03bb(j)t), |j\u3009 \u2261 \u03c8(j; q), (6)\nZ =\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nexp(\u2212U(q)\/D)dq\nand then arrives at a Schrodinger-type equation for the eigenfunctions \u03c8(j; q):\n\u2212D2\u03c8\u2032\u2032(j; q) + V (q)\u03c8(j; q) = D\u03bb(j)\u03c8(j; q), V (q) =\n1\n4\n(U \u2032 (q))\n2\n\u2212\n1\n2\nDU \u2032\u2032(q) (7)\nThe functions \u03c8(j; q) are orthonormal, \u3008j|j\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4jj\u2032 (the form of the expansion (6) is a bit\ndifferent from that used in [5]). Following the arguments given in Ref. 5 one can arrive\nat the following expression for the susceptibility of the system (4) with respect to a force\nA exp(\u2212i\u2126t):\n\u03c7(\u2126) = \u22122\n\u2211\nj\n(\u03bb(j)\u2212 i\u2126)\u22121\u30080|q|j\u3009\u3008j|\n\u2202\n\u2202q\n|0\u3009\n(\n\u3008j|L\u02c6|j\u2032\u3009 \u2261\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndq \u03c8(j; q)L\u02c6\u03c8(j\u2032; q)\n)\n(8)\n3\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb(j) and the eigenfunctions \u03c8(j; q) for low noise intensities D were anal-\nysed in Ref. [11]. The qualitative results can be easily understood by noticing that, for\na bistable initial potential U(q) and small D, the potential V (q) that appears in Eq. (7)\nhas 3 minima of nearly the same depth placed close to the stable positions q1,2 and an\nunstable stationary point qs (local maximum of U(q); U\n\u2032(q1,2) = U\n\u2032(qs) = 0, U\n\u2032\u2032(q1,2) >\n0, U \u2032\u2032(qs) < 0). Close to the minima V (q) is parabolic:\nV (q) \u2248 \u2212\n1\n2\nDU \u2032\u2032n +\n1\n4\n(U \u2032\u2032n)\n2(q \u2212 qn)\n2, |q \u2212 qn| \u226a |qn \u2212 qs|, U\n\u2032\u2032\nn \u2261 U\n\u2032\u2032(qn) (9)\nV (q) \u2248\n1\n2\nD|U \u2032\u2032s |+\n1\n4\n(U \u2032\u2032s )\n2(q \u2212 qs)\n2, |q \u2212 qs| \u226a |q1,2 \u2212 qs|, U\n\u2032\u2032\ns \u2261 U\n\u2032\u2032(qs)\nThe lowest \u201cenergy levels\u201d \u03bbn(0) of the motion within the wells n = 1, 2 of the potential\nV (the overbar is used to indicate intrawell states , and the subscript enumerates the wells\nat the corresponding stable positions qn) are degenerate, with \u03bb1,2(0) = 0 to the lowest\norder in D, giving rise to tunnelling splitting of these levels [11]. The low-lying excited\nintrawell states |j\u3009n \u2261 \u03c8n(j; q) are those of quantum harmonic oscillators, and\n\u03bbn(k) \u2248 kU\n\u2032\u2032\nn (10)\n(and of course, high excited states cannot be prescribed to a particular well).\nThe exact wave function of the ground state (that allows for the tunnelling splitting)\nis known to be\n\u03c8(0; q) = Z\u22121\/2 exp(\u2212U(q)\/2D), \u03bb(0) = 0 (11)\nIt has sharp maxima at q1,2 (of width \u03b4q \u223c (D\/U\n\u2032\u2032(qn))\n1\/2) and a minimum at qs. Near\nthe maxima, the function (11) is close to the intrawell ground-state oscillatory functions\n\u03c8n(0; q) weighted with the factors Z\n\u22121\/2(2piD\/U \u2032\u2032n)\n1\/4 \u00d7 exp(\u2212U(qn)\/2D). This makes it\npossible to evaluate the contribution to the susceptibility (8) from the excited intrawell\nstates, \u03c7intra(\u2126). Since, for a harmonic oscillator, the only nonzero matrix elements of the\noperator \u2202\/\u2202q are those between adjacent states, only the first excited intrawell states,\n\u03c8(j; q) \u2248 \u03c8n(1; q) (n = 1, 2) will contribute to \u03c7intra(\u2126). Allowing for the explicit form\nof the matrix elements, known from quantum mechanics [12], and for Eqs.(9), (10) we\nget, with an accuracy to small corrections \u223c D:\n\u03c7intra(\u2126) \u2248\n\u2211\nn=1,2\nwn(U\n\u2032\u2032\nn \u2212 i\u2126)\n\u22121 (12)\nHere, wn is the population of the nth stable state,\nwn =\nexp(\u2212\u2206U3\u2212n\/D)(U\n\u2032\u2032\n3\u2212n)\n1\/2\u2211\nm=1,2 exp(\u2212\u2206Um\/D)(U \u2032\u2032m)\n1\/2\n, \u2206Um \u2261 U(qs)\u2212 U(qm) (13)\nand we have evaluated the integral (6) for Z by the steepest descent method. The overlap\nintegral of the function \u03c8(0; q) with (non-oscillatory) wave functions of highly excited\nstates, as well as with the wave functions that correspond to the low-lying states in\nthe well of the potential V (q) centered at qs, are exponentially small, and therefore the\n4\ncontribution from the corresponding matrix elements to the susceptibility (8) can be\nignored.\nThe only other important contribution to \u03c7(\u2126) besides (12) is that from the matrix\nelements calculated between the function (11) and the function \u03c8(1; q) corresponding to\nthe excited state that results from the tunnel splitting of the degenerate intrawell state,\nwhence\n\u03c7(\u2126) \u2248 \u03c7intra(\u2126) + \u03c7tun(\u2126), \u03c7tun(\u2126) =\n\u03bb(1)\nD\n|\u30080|q|1\u3009|2\n\u03bb(1)\u2212 i\u2126\n(14)\nHere, we have implemented the interrelation [11], well-known from quantum mechanics,\nbetween the matrix elements of the operators \u2202\/\u2202q and q in terms of the energy difference\nbetween the states. The problem of evaluating \u03c7tun comes to the evaluation of the matrix\nelements of the coordinate. The latter can be done by making use of the explicit form of\nthe wave functions |0\u3009 (11) and |1\u3009. The function |1\u3009 as well as the value of \u03bb(1) were found\nin [11]. An alternative way to find them is based on applying to the present problem the\napproach suggested in [12] to calculate tunnelling level splitting in a symmetrical double-\nwell potential. It is easy to see that, in the spirit of [12], the wave function \u03c8(1; q) can\nbe sought in the form\n\u03c8(1; q) = A0\u03c8(0; q) + A1\u03c8\u02dc(1; q) (15)\n\u03c8\u02dc(1; q) \u2248\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u2212\u03c8(0; q), qs \u2212 q \u226b (D\/|U\n\u2032\u2032\ns |)\n1\/2\n\u03c8(0; q)(2|U \u2032\u2032s |\/piD)\n1\/2\n\u222b q\nqs dq\n\u2032 exp\n[\nU(q\u2032)\u2212U(qs)\nD\n]\n, |q \u2212 qs|\n<\n\u223c (D\/|U \u2032\u2032s |)\n1\/2\n\u03c8(0; q), q \u2212 qs \u226b (D\/|U\n\u2032\u2032\ns |)\n1\/2\nThe coefficients A0,1 can be obtained from the conditions of normalization of \u03c8(1; q) and of\northogonality of \u03c8(1; q) and \u03c8(0; q), whereas the eigenvalue \u03bb1 is given by the expression\n\u03bb(1) = \u2212D\u03c8(0; qs)\n(\nd\u03c8(1; q)\ndq\n)\nqs\n[\u222b qs\n\u2212\u221e\ndq \u03c8(0; q)\u03c8(1; q)\n]\n\u22121\n(16)\nthat immediately follows from (7), (11).\nIt is seen from Eqs. (8), (14) - (16) that the susceptibility \u03c7tun(\u2126) due to the transitions\nto the tunnel-split state 0\u2192 1 is of the following form\n\u03c7tun(\u2126) = w1w2(q2 \u2212 q1)\n2\u03bb(1)\nD\n(\u03bb(1)\u2212 i\u2126)\u22121 (17)\n\u03bb(1) = pi\u22121\n\u2211\nn=1,2\n[\u221a\nU \u2032\u2032n |U\n\u2032\u2032\ns | exp(\u2212\u2206Un\/D)\n]\nIn the particular case of a symmetrical potential U(q) Eqs.(1), (12), (14), (16) go over\ninto the result obtained in [5].\nIt is interesting to compare the result of the present calculations with the expression\n(3) applied to the model (4). The explicit form of the susceptibility for this model was\ndiscussed in [2, 3]. The intrawell susceptibilities \u03c7n(\u2126) = (U\n\u2032\u2032\nn \u2212 i\u2126)\n\u22121 follow from Eq.(4)\nlinearized about the stable positions q1,2. The expression for the susceptibility due to\ninterwell transitions is of the form:\n5\n\u03c7tr(\u2126) = w1w2(q2 \u2212 q1)\n2W\nD\n(W \u2212 i\u2126)\u22121 (18)\nwhere wn is the population of the nth state, and W is the sum of the probabilities of\nthe transitions between the states (cf. (2)). Allowing for the explicit expressions for the\ntransition probabilities, one finds that the intrawell contribution \u03c7intra(\u2126) obtained above\nis precisely equal to that given by (3), and that \u03bb(1) = W (cf. [10, 11]) and therefore\n\u03c7tun(\u2126) = \u03c7tr(\u2126), and the susceptibilities as a whole coincide with each other. So they\ndo also in the particular case of a symmetric double-well potential discussed in [5]. The\nexplicit expression for the spectral density of fluctuations considered in [5] coincides with\nthat discussed in [2,3] for the model (3) as well. We notice that, in the general case of an\nasymmetric potential, the intensity of the transition- (or, equivalently) tunnelling-induced\npeak in the susceptibility (17), (18) is proportional to w1w2 \u221d exp(\u2212|U(q1)\u2212 U(q2)|\/D),\nand it drops down extremely sharply with the difference in the depths of the wells.\nIt follows from the above discussion that two, seemingly different, approaches to the\nanalysis of the susceptibility of a double-well system, one based on a simple physical\npicture of the motion and the other based on the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation\nwhen the latter applies, give identical results. This can be regarded as an extra indication\nof the usefulness of linear response theory in the context of stochastic resonance.\n6\nREFERENCES\n1. Special issue of the J. Stat.
