A light emitting PS\nchip with a stable and functional surface was fabricated in our laboratory. When\nprotein was deposited on it, the light emission was reduced in proportion to the\nprotein concentration. Based on this property, we developed a rudimentary\ndemonstration of a label-free sensor to detect bovine serum albumin (BSA). A serial\nconcentration of BSA was applied to the light chip and the reduction in light emission\nwas measured. The reduction of the light intensity was linearly related to the\nconcentration of the BSA at concentrations below 10-5M. The detection limit was\n8x10-9 M.\nKeywords: Nano-porous silicon; label-free biosensor; Optical sensor\n31. Introduction\nLight emission from porous silicon (PS) was first described by Canham in 1990.\nDuring the early 90\u2019s, exploitation of this phenomenon mostly focused on\nmicroelectronic and optoelectronic areas (Smith et al. 1992; Hamilton 1995; Canham\n1997) with research being carried out by physical and material scientists. Following\nthis initial work, the effect of nano-structures, the light emission principle and further\nsurface characterization studies were also undertaken (Linford et al. 1995; Song et al.\n1998; Parisinia et al. 2000). It was shown that the PS light-emission intensity is\nlargely reliant on surface termination (Allen et al. 1999). Conjugating groups with\nphenylacetylenyl (Song et al. 1998) completely quenched the light emission, whereas\nisolated double bonds only quenched 40\u00b180% of the light intensity (Buriak et al.\n1998). Simple phenyl termination had little effect, as compared to the Si\u00b1Hx\nterminated PS (Song et al. 1998).\nSince the electrical and optical properties of PS are largely determined by its\nnano-structure and are particularly sensitive to adsorbates on the internal surfaces, the\nchanges in these properties following chemical interactions enables PS to operate as a\nbasic chemical sensor (Mulloni et al. 2000; De Stefano et al. 2003a; De Stefano et al.\n2003b; De Stefano et al. 2004)\nChan and co-workers (Chan et al. 2001) demonstrated a DNA sensor with Bragg\nreflector. Porous silicon can luminesce efficiently in the visible. When a luminescent porous\n4silicon layer is inserted between two Bragg reflectors, the broad luminescence band is altered and\nmultiple, further the very narrow peaks are detected.\nAn interferometric biosensor using a double-layer of PS has been investigated by\nPacholski et al. in 2005. It comprised of a top layer with large pores and a bottom\nlayer with smaller pores. The reflectivity spectrum of this structure displayed a\ncomplicated interference pattern. Shifts of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) peaks\nindicate penetration of biomolecules into the different layers. A small molecule,\nsucrose, entered into both porous Si layers, whereas a large protein only entered the\nlarge pores. Detection was accomplished either by computing the weighted difference\nin the frequencies of two peaks or by computing the ratio of the intensities of two\npeaks in the FFT spectrum. More recently, De Stefano and co-workers (De Stefano et\nal. 2006) published their work on PS based optical microsensor for the detection of\nL-glutamine. The molecular binding between the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP)\nfrom Escherichia coli and L-glutamine (Gln) was revealed as a shift in wavelength of\nthe fringes. Due to the hydrophobic interaction with the Si-H terminated surface of the\nporous silicon, the GlnBP protein, which acts as a molecular probe for Gln, penetrates\nand links into the pores of the porous silicon matrix.\nIn the current work, we employed the principle of PS light intensity changes\nfollowing molecule adsorption to develop a simple and low cost label-free biosensor\n(see the conclusion section).\n2. Materials and methods\n5The PS was fabricated from p-type silicon with a specific resistance \u03c1=1-2 \u03a9.cm\nusing an electrochemical etching process at 300 mA\/cm2 in hydrofluoric acid (HF)\nsolution followed by treating with H2O2 to oxidize the PS surface (Linford et al.\n1995).\nThe pore size of PS was detected by Jem-100Cex-II transmission electron\nmicroscope (TEM) from Shimadzu.\nThe surface chemistry was analyzed by VECTOR22 fourier transform infrared\n(FT-IR) from Brurker Optics.\nThe protein binding capacity of PS chip was achieved by immersing the PS chips\ninto the 5mg\/ml BSA solution for 2 hours at room temperature. After rinsed\nthoroughly with dH2O, the protein-PS surface was etched off with sonication in 20%\nHF and then the protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay.\nThis assay is based on the observation that the absorbance maximum for Coomassie\nBrilliant Blue G-250 shift from 465 nm to 595 nm when binding to protein and the\ndifferential colour change of the dye in response to various concentrations of protein.\nThe standard curve was made from a concentration series of bovine serum albumin\n(BSA). Samples and standards were reacted with dye for 5 minutes and then read at\nOD595.\nThe relationship between the PS surface fluorescence reduction and the immobilized\nBSA concentration was analyzed. The adsorption was carried out by immersing the\nPS chips of 0.5mm2 into BSA solutions with concentration of 0.05mg\/ml\uff0c0.1mg\/ml\uff0c\n0.5mg\/ml, 1mg\/ml, 2mg\/ml and dH2O for 2 hours at room temperature. The chips\n6were then washed with dH2O thoroughly. After drying in air, the fluorescence\nintensity was measured using a RF-5301 fluorometer from Shimadzu. The chip\nstability was also studied by measuring the light emission from the same chips every\nhour, every day and every month. All experiments were undertaken in triplicates.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe factors affecting light emission from PS are functional groups, gas, other\nmolecules and the pore size on the PS surface. The pore radii vary from 4-12 nm for\nPS etched at 220 mA\/cm2 and up to 300-800 nm for PS etched at 600 mA\/cm2\n(Janshoff et al. 1998). Under our working condition, the pore size of PS is about 20nm\n(figure 1). The PS chips are stable for more than 4 months (figure 2 and more data did\nnot show here). When exited with UV light at about 360nm, the PS emits bright\nfluoresce at 569nm. The silicon dissolution involves two free carriers (electrons and\nholes). When PS was etched in the HF solution, the surface acquires Si-F bonds and\nSi-H termination and it became hydrophobic and unstable. After the surface was\noxidized with H2O2, the PS surface was modified with Si\u2013OH and Si\u2013O (Figure 3). It\nthen became hydrophilic, stable and ready for protein adsorption.\nThe protein binding capacity of PS chip is about 4 \u00b5g\/cm2 (see material and\nmethods).\nThe results shown in Figure 4 were obtained by immersing the PS chips into\ndifferent concentration of BSA solutions and then measuring the light reduction. This\nrevealed that the intensity of fluoresce varied in inverse proportion to the\n7concentration of BSA. When BSA concentrations were lower than 1mg\/ml, the\nfluorescence was reduced by about 9% for each increase in BSA concentration of\n0.5mg\/ml. However, when the BSA concentration was greater than 1mg\/ml, the\nfluoresce reduction became much less, indicating that the surface of the chips were\nsaturated with BSA. Further, the detection limit was calculation based on the data\nfrom figure 4 and it was 8x10-9 M.\nThe light reduction was presumably caused by the interaction between the PS\nsurface and BSA. The ions existing on the PS surface within the nano-structure absorb\nenergy from UV and then emit light. When BSA molecules bound to the surface, the\nPS surface chemistry, charges, pore size and structures are all subject to change.\nConsequently, the energy intake and light emission were reduced. However, we also\nfound that some gases, biological materials, inorganic and organic molecules also\nchange the light intensity as well (results are not shown).\n4. Conclusion\nWe have investigated a simple and label free optical BSA sensor, based on the\ninteraction of protein molecules with the nano-PS surface. The PS obtained under our\nexperimental conditions has the pore size of about 20nm and area of about\n500cm2\/cm3 and emitted fluorescence under UV light. This provided good\ncharacteristics for new biosensor development. We showed that a series of\nconcentrations of BSA absorbed on the surface of the PS resulted in a proportional\ndecrease in fluorescence, We also found that some gases, biological materials,\n8inorganic and organic molecules also change the light intensity as well. The detection\nlimit of the sensor was about 8x10-9 M. This method for monitoring BSA is label free\nand uses a simple and inexpensive technique for PS preparation. As a measurement\nsystem it is simple to operate and offers high sensitivity and hence may have utility\nfor a range of analytes provided that suitable selectivity can be introduced onto the\nsurface.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors would like to thanks the Ministry of Education, the Tianjin Municipal\nScience and Technology Commission and the Tianjin University of Science and\nTechnology to support the work.\nReferences\nBuriak, J.
