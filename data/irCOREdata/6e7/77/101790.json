INTRODUCTION \nThe expanding applications for microwave communications \nhave generated a need for compact, high performance \nantennas that combine the potential for integration with high \nfunctionality. The proposed antenna meets these key \nrequirements by utilising a multilayer format that provides a \nvery compact structure, whilst a novel feeding technique that \noffers opportunities for high functionality. The functionality is \nachieved by using PIN diodes to switch the direction of the \nsignal in the feed lines. Various possibilities exist for \nswitching between circular and linear polarization, but in this \ncase we have demonstrated the switching between the two \nhands of circular polarization. \n  The antenna was fabricated using a new polymer technology \nto form a multilayer structure. The polymer material had two \nprimary advantages for the present work: (i) the material \ncould be loaded with ceramic to change the dielectric constant; \n(ii) the material could be laminated, under low pressure and \ntemperature, to form a multilayer circuit. These properties \nmeant that low dielectric constant material could be used \nbeneath the radiation patches, to enhance radiation [2], and a \nhigh dielectric material could be used for the feed network to \nachieve a compact. \nII. ANTENNA STRUCTURE \nThe antenna was essentially composed of two dielectric \nlayers, separated by a common ground plane as illustrated in \nFig. 1. An overview of the complete antenna, showing the \nregistration of the various layers is given in Fig. 2.The \nradiating patches were formed on the surface of the layer with \nlow dielectric constant (\u03b5r=3) , and the microstrip feed \nnetwork on the layer with high dielectric constant (\u03b5r=6). Slots \nwere etched in the ground plane prior to lamination. The slot \ndimensions were designed to provide a characteristic \nimpedance of 50 \u2126 [3]. The slots were formed into two, \nparallel annular rings, running beneath the patches. Fig. 3 \nshows the relative position of the conductors on each layer, \nand Fig. 6 shows photographs of the top and bottom surfaces \nof the final structure.  Four beam-lead PIN diodes were \nsurface-mounted on the microstrip feed network to route the \ninput signal to one or other of the slotlines, and Fig. 5 shows \nthe surface mounted diodes. \nThe position of two VIA arrays are shown in Fig. 2. These \nwere used to connect two ends of signal lines on the bottom \nlayer to a short length of line on the top layer, thus enabling \nsignal lines to cross. Note that these VIAs pass through \nregions of the buried ground plane where the conductor was \nbeen removed to prevent the VIAs shorting to ground. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.

Dual slotline arrangement[1]. \n \n   One of the benefits of using the polymer material was that \nlow dielectric material could be selected for the substrate \nimmediately beneath the patches, thus enhancing the radiation. \n \nIn order to switch the traveling wave signal between the two \nrings, and thus change the hand of polarization, PIN diode \nswitching elements were incorporated into the microstrip feed \nnetworks as indicated in Fig 4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4a.

ANTENNA THEORY \nA signal applied to the microstrip line at port 1 of the \nantenna will be coupled to one of the buried slotline, through \nmicrostrip-to-slotline transitions. The states of the PIN diodes \nwill determine which of the slotlines is energized. Energy \ntravelling in a slotline beneath the patches will excite the \npatches into resonance and cause radiation. Since the annular \nspacing of the 8 patches is 45\u00b0, and the circumference of the \nring is n\u03bbg, a circularly polarized signal will be radiated. As \nthe signal travels around the slotline ring, there is successive \ncoupling of energy into the patches. Clearly there will be a \nprogressive loss of energy as the signal propagates around the \nring, and to ensure that each patch receives the same level of \ncoupled energy, there is a progressive offset of the patches \nrelative to the slotline, ensuring that the later patches are more \nstrongly coupled to the line. Two slotline channels are \nprovided, so that switching between them enables either right-\nhand, or left-hand, circular polarization to be produced, as \nindicated in Fig. 1.      \nIV.

MEASUREMENT DATA \nThe return loss of the antenna for both polarizations is \nillustrated in Fig. 7. The optimum frequency of operation was \n14.95GHz, within 1% of the designed value of 15GHz.

In this \nfigure the through loss is represented by |S21|.

DISCUSSION \nThe measured performance of the antenna was close to the \npredicted performance, indicating that the design technique \nwas fairly robust.  \n \nThe antenna offers a number of beneficial features: \n \n(i)  The use of a multilayer structure, with mixed dielectric \nconstant, proved useful in enhancing the radiation from the \npatches, whilst maintaining a small overall size for the \nantenna. \n(ii) The antenna offers significant potential for further \nintegration, by closely coupling the front-end circuitry of a \ntransceiver in a layer beneath the feed network. \n(iii) The design offers significant opportunities to increase the \nfunctionality of the antenna. Further slotline channels \nincorporating switching elements could be used to obtain \nlinear polarization. Also, additional rings of patches could be \nused to broaden the bandwidth. \nVII. CONCLUSIONS \nThe concept of a new dual circular polarized active antenna, \nwith the capability of switching between right and left hand \ncircular polarization has been established through practical \nmeasurement. Opportunities have been identified to extend the \ndesign to a highly integrated smart antenna, having high \nfunctionality.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] K.M. Lum; T. Tick; C. Free; H.
