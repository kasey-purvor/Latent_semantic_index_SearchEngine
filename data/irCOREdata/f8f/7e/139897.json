Building on this kernel of self-analysis, the 8\nth\n conference of the \nInternational Research Network of Organizing by Projects (IRNOP VIII), held at the \nUniversity of Brighton in September 2007, concluded with a debate addressing the motion: \n \n\u201cThat this house believes that we no longer need the discipline of project management\u201d \n \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nThe debate was deliberately provocative and intended as a light way to end the conference \nafter the hard work that preceded it. However, this light-hearted debate raised some hard \nissues about project management itself and about research on projects and project \nmanagement. \nThe discussion was opened with an intriguing definition of \u201ediscipline\u201f not as a branch of \nknowledge, but rather as systematic training in obedience to regulations and authority. This \ndefinition was used polemically, but it provides interesting and valuable insights, functioning \nas a caricature of the traditional project management concepts.  Another intriguing argument \nwas that this area and the statement posed for discussion were based on the premise that the \nproject management discipline exists - but does it really? \n \nOn the other hand, the discipline of project management as a field of study was defended. \nPeople have undertaken projects for more than 6,000 years, and projects are the key \ninstrument for the development of society, starting from the pyramids and the Great Wall of \nChina, and this is not going to change: people will keep undertaking projects, and it is our \nduty to our children and grandchildren to continue developing project management. \n \nHowever, projects have been facing problems since the pyramids [2], and it is clear that the \n(traditional) discipline of project management as we know it today is unable to cope with all \nissues involved in the undertaking of projects.  The discussion following the debate suggested \nthat the discipline of project management is not passive to this critique, and has been \ndeveloped, in both theory and practice, whether deliberately or not [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].  \nOne may argue about what the project management discipline comprises, whether what we \nhave at the moment is adequate.  However, we need a discipline of project management as a \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nknowledge field.  Thus, the question is how to develop and how to apply this knowledge in \nprojects. \nThe arguments presented in the discussion are organised in four areas, which considered a \nbroader definition of the actor in the statement, and whether the project management \ndiscipline is understood as the traditional approaches to projects or the research field of \nproject management, as shown in Fig. 1. \n \n What? \nProject Management as \nTraditional Body of \nKnowledge on projects \nProject Management \nDiscipline as Knowledge \nField \n \nWho? \n\u201eWe\u201f as practitioners 1. Discipline needed \u2013 \noften rejected without \ndisciplines being used \nrigorously.  Some \nexamples in complex \nprojects were limiting at \nhigh levels. \n2. Practitioners need the \nknowledge discipline \u2013 \npractice expanding and some \nhighly challenging problems \nexisting and emerging. \n\u201eWe\u201f as academics 3.  Management academics \nmanaging their projects \nusing a disciplined PM \napproach.  Perish the \nthought. \n4. Discipline provides a point \nof convergence for teaching \nand research. \nFigure 1: Overview of the Arguments \n \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nConsidering area 1: in a world where \u201ewe\u201f know what to do, goals do not change, and \ninformation is not ambiguous, the project management discipline is extremely relevant. Some \nacademics hold the view that such a world does not exist; a project is per se complex, \ndynamic and unique, and its management is embedded and should take into account social \nnetworks, and consequently, \u201ethe\u201f discipline in projects is rather harmful. Another group \nargued that many projects are still in this zone \u2013 projectification has seen to that [11].  \nHowever, many reject the notion of discipline as \u201etoo difficult,\u201f without proper evaluation.  \nThis presents a paradox \u2013 projects are still failing with some regularity (e.g. [12]), and yet the \nfailure is often ascribed to lack of basic processes [13, 14]. \n \nAll agreed that where none of these aspects dominate, that is in a dynamic, complex \nambiguous world, \u201ethe\u201f discipline of practice as currently described in the bodies of \nknowledge (e.g. [15, 16]) does have the potential to be harmful. The conventional, linear \nrational approach is insufficient, at least for some aspects of the project, and what \u201ewe\u201f need is \nan approach that recognises the social structuration of projects that is better able to deal with \ncomplexities. \n \nThus, the \u201ediscipline\u201f of project management means not only following good procedures on \nhow to manage projects (these are essential) but also adherence to a \u201erational\u201f approach to \nproject management, which is based on \u201ethe\u201f discipline (as a unitary discipline), rather than \nmulti-disciplinary. Consequently, project management as a knowledge field should include \nmore than only \u201ethe traditional discipline\u201f. \n \nThe practitioners\u201f demand for the discipline of project management as a knowledge field is \nrepresented in area 2.  A good project manager needs to develop and deploy personal \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \ncompetences and good judgement in very difficult and changing circumstances \u2013 rather than \n\u201estick to the traditional discipline\u201f. However, at the task level in such projects, sticking to the \ndiscipline is considered by many to be vital.  Consequently, one criticism of the current \n\u201cdiscipline\u201d of project management addressed the lack of consideration of social skills in \nprojects and just as importantly, its lack of contextualisation.  \n \nSome attempts to provide more agile or extreme approaches to project management were \nmentioned \u2013 originating in IT projects (see for instance [17]).  Whilst it is tempting at first \nglance to treat these as \u201eundisciplined\u201f, the truth is far from this.  SCRUM, XP and other \nmethods require much higher levels of discipline from people working in those environments \nthan is otherwise expected. \n \nIn area 3, the spectre of academics needing the discipline of project management was raised.  \nIn scientific research, this has provided considerable interest for researchers, but management \nresearchers appear less reflective.  For example, the fact that a computer generated \u201escientific \npaper\u201f programmed by Stribling et al. [18] was accepted in a conference is a clear evidence of \nthis bureaucratisation of research [19].  Perhaps this is one area in which disciplines in \nmanaging the planning and execution of research, teaching and writing projects are \u201eone step \ntoo far\u201f.  \n \nArea 4 represents the discipline as a point of integration for people researching, teaching and \nwriting in the area and its position in relation to other disciplines \u2013 needed by academics. The \naspect of teaching and research in the discipline does provide a challenge however.  It has \nbecome expected that teaching project management involves educating students in tools and \ntechniques.  Those same teachers then research the very same practice with much more \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nelaborate critical and mature concepts, only to find situations in which these are insufficient or \njust wrong (as described above). It was argued that it displays a lack of responsibility from \nour side to teach the discipline of project management (emphasizing \u201cdiscipline\u201d) and then to \ncriticise our students for using exactly what we have taught as soon as they become \nprofessionals.  However, there is an argument that different levels of maturity in knowledge \nare at play here, and that as the taught discipline catches up with research and more advanced \ncourses are offered, this phenomenon will occur less frequently. Thus, there is a gap between \nthe theory on projects (including ambiguity and soft skills) and the practice as it is being \npresented in many class rooms and training sessions. In a way we tend to respond to a need \nfor easy, generic and pragmatic solutions, whereas reality is, as always, complex, ambiguous \nand changing. As stated by Morris [20] already in 1994, \"the great majority of publications on \nproject management deal with techniques and procedures rather than management practice\" \n(p.vii). The challenge is to combine these two views. \n \nThe modesty of project management research can be criticised: we are connecting to theories \nof management, organization sociology and strategy in our analysis of projects. Based on this, \nproject management scholars should be contributing immensely to the debate, theories and \ndiscussions on general management. Project management research often concentrates on the \ntemporary aspects of organizations, the uncertainty and ambiguity of organizations and the \nnetwork character of organizational interactions. These are concepts and ideas that are current \nand timely in the wider management debate as well. We have the insights, the concepts and \nthe empirical research, but too much is kept within the walls of traditional project \nmanagement communities instead of extending into cutting edge organizational research. \nNow there are classical administration scholars and even other social sciences (education, \nsociology) interested in the phenomenon of projects. They may dominate the arena within a \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nfew years while project management researchers are being neglected and marginalized. Thus, \nthe forum would like to see an enhancement of maturity of project management as a research \ndiscipline to facilitate a more comprehensive contribution to the wider management field. \n \nTwo reasons make us think that research in projects will benefit from all areas, and develop \nboth the denial and the approval of the statement.  \nFirstly, project managers strive to create order, and are partly successful, as the existence of \nsome order is deemed to be related to the success of projects [21]. \nHowever, \u201ediscipline\u201f is necessary but not sufficient. The wish to avoid inefficiency, and to \ndominate uncertainty and risks, bureaucratises the project work [22] and changes the function \nof project managers from a manager of creativity, change and risk to a manager of paper and \nforms [23, 24, 25, 26], and consequently, the traditional project management discipline may \nbe harmful for projects, if followed blindly. \nIf we understand the project management discipline as a positivistic discipline, dreaming of \norder in the chaotic nature of a project, then its existence is significant. Perhaps it is time to \naccept, however, that \u201call models are wrong, but some are useful\u201d ([27], p. 424), and \nconsequently, it is not that one does not need some of the traditional tools of project \nmanagement, such as Gant Charts or Work Breakdown Structure, even though practitioners \nand academics know that these tools do not display the reality of projects. \u201eThe traditional \ndiscipline\u201f of project management should be about striving for order by recognising and \nstructurally considering the chaos embedded in projects. However, the phenomenon of a \nproject demands more than just dreaming of structure, it demands a \u201enon-discipline\u201f, which \nlooks into the chaotic reality of projects and proposes feasible ideas to deal with this reality. \nThis discussion goes beyond the coexistence of approaches to manage projects. This leads to \nthe second aspect: the diversity present in the research of project management. \nGeraldi, J., Rodney Turner, J., Maylor, H., Soderholm, A., Hobday, M. & Brady, T. 2008, \n'Innovation in project management: Voices of researchers', International Journal of Project \nManagement, vol. 26, no. 5, pp. 586-589. http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijproman.2008.05.011 \n \nProjects, in empirical terms, have developed into being a multitude of things - from changing \nbreakfast routines at day care centers to the construction of Hong Kong airport. This is \nconsiderably different from the post war situation, where projects were a much narrower \nconcept in terms of where the term was used. Consequently, our research needs to mirror the \ndiversity of the field. \nFurthermore, looking for the answer is a sign of the field being immature, so part of the \nmaturity of project management research is to accept the complexity present in real life and to \naccept several perspectives studying such reality. \nThe discussions indicate that project management research is in a fruitful moment of \nrevolution of paradigms [28]. We wish that the new paradigm accepts the plurality of research \nin projects and comprises the discipline and \u201cnon-discipline\u201d simultaneously. The research \nmethodologies should be developed in this direction, for example as suggested by Bredillet \n[29], who proposes the combination of epistemologies and proposes the intelligence of \nadaptation in project practice and research. Drawing on Ashby\u201fs law of variety [30] it might \nbe exactly this diversity and contradiction that may aid our comprehension of \u201eprojects\u201f. \nThus, we need (and are looking forward to reading) discussions supporting but also \ndiscussions refusing the \u201emotion\u201f proposed in the IRNOP VIII, and by this means, proposing \nanswers, rather than THE answer, to the future of \u201ethe project management discipline\u201f. \nWe may note that while carrying out research on project management, we may also be \nrequired to use the discipline of project management.  That in itself would be worthy of \nresearch\u2026 \n \n \nReferences \n[1] See for instance: \n      Turner, J.R.
