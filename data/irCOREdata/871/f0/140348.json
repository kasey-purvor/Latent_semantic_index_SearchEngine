Golder Associates, 2002 This publication regards risk assessment only for small and closed landfills. It briefly mentions hazards and risks in the context of contamination of groundwater; contamination of surface water; gas accumulation; and direct exposure to contaminated soil, sharp objects or hazardous gases. These are the only four scenarios, which this publication addresses very briefly. There is no strategic procedure to carry out exposure assessment process in a quantitative manner for landfill leachate, which could take account of all possible scenarios. There is lack of in-depth algorithmic exposure quantification system that sequentially ties together the factors involved such as exposure duration, frequency, exposure media and routes. In summary, it is not in remit of this publication to address all the elements mentioned above (in Row 1) in a holistic format specifically for landfill leachate. CIRIA, 2001 This publication is only for closed landfill sites. The publication contains a chapter specifically on risk assessment, which also contains a brief section on exposure There is no procedure for exposure assessment.30 assessment where main factors of exposure analysis are only mentioned. Environment Agency, 2003a Provides guideline for landfill risk assessment and only for groundwater as receptor. Identifies some fundamental requirements of risk assessment on, for example, geology, hydrogeology, and site investigation. Though a guideline on landfill risk assessment exists but it is not for considering receptors other than groundwater. Though this publication relates to risk assessment for landfill leachate, but it is not holistic in the form of a methodology or ready-to-use procedure. There are no considerations of quantification of exposure and risk. The computer modelling aspect of the publication (i.e. LandSim) is discussed in Section 3.0. DETR et. al., 2000 As the document states itself that it provides material, in general, for the development of risk analysis guidance to assist issues like contaminated land, waste management, major accident hazards. The publication addresses a range of issues in general (listed in the left column) but not specifically for landfills or landfill leachate. The objective of this publication is not to develop an integrated exposure assessment to assist quantitative risk analysis. In summary, in the context of landfill leachate all the elements above (Row 1) are not in the remit of this publication. DEFRA and Environment Agency, 2002 This publication relates to exposure assessment for humans from contaminated lands. Details on various aspects of exposure assessment are given. Examples are exposure parameters (such as exposure duration, frequency), soil release and transfer mechanisms, exposure equations, human activities and ages, exposure routes, various landuses. Deals in detail with humans as receptors, but not other environmental species and eco-systems. Element number 5 above is also not there. It is not specifically landfill leachate. It is for contaminated land in general. Environment This document briefly addresses a broad and diverse range A holistic exposure assessment procedure accompanied with a31 Agency, 2004 of facets of landfill risk analysis along social, technical, environmental, economic, and legislative and managerial themes. Both landfill gas and leachate are addressed. The main scope of the guidance is limited to five areas of risk analysis, which are accidents and their consequences; hydrogeology; landfill gas; particulate matter; and stability. The document briefly touches on elements like source, pathway and receptors yet not as parts of exposure assessment system. corresponding computer model is not in the remit of this publication. There is no allowance for exposure quantification. Statistical descriptions like maximum, mean and minimum exposures are not in the scope either. As the document states itself that there are five main areas, which constitute the main remit of the guidance (listed in the left column). Yet landfill leachate is not one of them though is addressed to an extent. The guidance also mentions that it does not provide all the detail needed to conduct risk analysis for a landfill and the same holds for exposure assessment. Gregory, R. G. et. al., 1999 This publication is for risk analysis of landfill gas only. Concerns mainly humans as receptors. Engages with some risk assessment modules such as gas generation, human exposure assessment with quantification aspect, pollutants\u2019 migration. The risk quantification aspect is absent. It is not for landfill leachate. Element 5 above is not embedded, even for landfill gas. From a leachate perspective, all the aforesaid elements are absent. Moschandreas et. al., 2002 Focuses on one type of hazard i.e. Particulate Matter (PM) and only in air as an exposure medium. The only exposure route accounted for is inhalation and considers only humans as receptors. Does not present exposure assessment as an overall procedure and specially element 5 above is not included. This publication is not specifically for landfills. As mentioned in the corresponding left adjacent cell, consideration of types of hazard, exposure medium, exposure route, and receptor is very limited. Bagli and Spadoni, 2000 This publication takes account of industrial facilities as pollutant source and humans as receptors. It touches on various aspects of exposure assessment including exposure routes, equations and quantification. Also briefly writes It is not for landfills at all. Exposure assessment is not presented as an overall procedure. Receptors other than humans have not been included. In the context of landfill leachate all the elements mentioned above are absent as well.32 about risk assessment in the light of GIS (Geographical Information System). Redfearn et. al., 2000 This publication, which is a paper, is related to risk assessment and thus also briefly mentions Exposure Assessment. However this publication is related to landfill gas and not leachate. Thus, it focuses on exposure route of inhalation only. Also, it identifies some sensitivities and uncertainties associated with Exposure Assessment. Apart from a very limited section on exposure assessment, there is no procedure for describing how to perform exposure analysis process. All the elements mentioned above are absent from the perspective of leachate. Although the first four elements are partly addressed to an extent, but the consideration is from the landfill gas perspective. DoE, 1995 This publication portrays Exposure Assessment in a holistic manner, more than any other literature studied to date. However, the focus is not all environmental receptors but human health only. Similarly, not all potential pathways have been included, but only six exposure pathways which cover most risks to human health from landfills. Does not present an exposure assessment procedure in a holistic manner, in the form of a computer model, that is element number 6 (above in Row 1) is absent. Does not take account of all environmental receptors such as flora and fauna, but only humans. With reference to point 2 above. This publication does not seem to have a facility where all individual exposures via various corresponding individual exposure routes, could be summed up to determine total exposure for a given receptor exposed to a given hazard. Does not take account of statistical aspects as indicated in point 5 above. Eduljee, 1998 A procedure on exposure assessment has been outlined which covers elements like 1 and 2 (listed above) to various levels of detail. However, only humans have been considered as receptors. No computer model exists for the exposure assessment procedure in a holistic manner. Elements 3, 4 and 5 above are absent and element 2 is addressed to a limited extent. The procedure presented excludes various environmental receptors such as flora, fauna and the built environment. Asante-Duah, 1996 Encircles all important aspects of risk analysis and management (including exposure assessment) of Not specifically for landfills. Also all the elements above are absent.33 contaminated lands, but not in the form of a methodology. The various aspects have been considered as independent of each other. Daugherty, 1998 Contains details not only of exposure but also those of sources (of hazards), pathways and receptors in separate chapters. This publication, like others, does not depict exposure assessment in the form of a procedure that a risk assessor could use to measure exposure. The publication is not specifically for landfills. Moreover, all the elements above are absent. Environment Agency, 2003e This landfill risk assessment publication is from the perspective of issues including noise, odour, litter, birds, vermin, insects, and mud on road. The publication is not about landfill leachate in the first place. The elements indicated in Row 1 above thus are not in the scope of the publication. Bernard et. al., 1996; 1997 These two papers (Part 1 and 2) are on hazard analysis of landfill leachate. They discuss leachates from 25 landfills in France as case studies with a number of methods of determining leachate toxicity and then comparing the physico-chemical characteristics of leachates. Although, the techniques identified on measuring toxicity of landfill leachate can be useful in exposure assessment for a given landfill. But these papers still are not to present procedures for exposure analysis and the elements expressed above are not addressed in an integrated manner. EPD, 1997 This publication is a guideline for hazard analysis of landfill gas. It briefly covers various aspects of hazard and risk assessment such as hazard mitigation measures and source-pathway-target analysis approach. The publication is not for landfill leachate. Even for landfill gas the aforesaid elements are either completely absent or very few are partly covered to limited extent (as mentioned in the left column). Kavazanjian et. al., 1995; Eisenbeis, et. al., 1986; In addition to other old literature on landfill assessment discussed earlier in this paper, these were also investigated to make sure if there was any work done on exposure analysis, relatively further in the past. These have been These publications cover various aspects and factors of risk assessments (including exposure analysis) to varying degrees. However, none of them appear to present a holistic system of exposure assessment process in a quantitative manner for landfill leachate, which could take account34 Jaggy, 1996; WDA, 1994; LaGoy, 1994; DOE, 1994; and Pieper et. al., 1997. found to address various risk assessment issues like seismic hazard analysis for landfills; risk assessment itself; landfill type and nature; contaminated land remediation; hazardous wastes; HWIR (Hazardous Waste Identification Rule); and specific hazards such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD\/F). of all possible scenarios and elements indicated in Row 1 above. SEPA, 2002 This publication regards landfill risk assessment in the context of landfill leachate liners and drainage systems. This publication is not to describe a strategic procedure to carry out exposure assessment process in a quantitative manner. CPPD, 2004 Currently the publication is in a draft form. It regards hazard and risk assessment in the context of natural hazards such as flooding, earthquake, landslides, wildfire. The publication is not for anthropogenic activities in the first place. Therefore does not consider landfills at all. Though discusses various natural hazards with statistics but does not present a structured exposure analysis procedure even for the natural hazards covered. Rudland et. al., 2001 Describes a basic framework for the risk assessment of contaminated land. Not for landfills in specific. All the elements above (Row 1) are absent. Auckland Regional Council, 2002 This publication, which is a government document for local authorities, covers risk assessment in a very broad sense of hazards. These include natural hazards such as tornado, flooding, earthquake; technological hazards like high pressure gas mains, computer systems failure; biological hazards including disease amongst people, animals or plants; and civil \/ political hazards comprising terrorism and civil unrest. The publication is not specifically for landfills. It just encapsulates all natural and anthropogenic hazards without presenting a holistic procedure either for exposure assessment or risk analysis. The format is more like a checklist. DOE, 1998 This environmental guidance mentions Risk-Based The purpose of this document is not the development of a holistic35 Corrective Action (RBCA) standards developed for addressing petroleum and chemical releases. The purpose of this guide is to explain risk-based decision making and the RBCA process for environmental restoration of chemically contaminated sites. exposure assessment methodology. The system presented is not for landfills as such. The system emphasises more on determining the data required for technical decision making rather than on following specific steps of exposure assessment process as indicated in the aforesaid elements in Row 1. EPA, 1998; EPA, 1996a; 1996b; 1996c. These four documents are regarding risk assessments of neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, ecology and carcinogens, respectively. Though these documents may be useful in exposure assessment and risk analysis of landfill leachate in the context of establishing neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, ecological and carcinogenic affects of leachate pollutants. However, these publications are not produced specifically from the point of view of landfill leachate. Thus, there is no integrated procedure to carry out exposure analysis process in a quantitative manner for landfill leachate, which could take account of all possible scenarios and the elements indicated above in Row 1. EPA, 1992; 1999 These publications are purely for exposure assessment. Thus, they encircle the subject from many different perspectives including not only aspects of hazards, pathways, receptors and exposures; but also types of doses (e.g. potential dose, intake dose, applied dose), exposure dose relationships, uncertainty assessment, individual and population exposure, exposure analysis in epidemiological studies, and position of the exposure assessment itself with respect to risk characterisation. Although these publications focus purely on exposure assessment, the documents do not portray a holistic procedure for carrying out exposure analysis. Neither specifically for landfills nor for any other environmental risk analysis. All the elements above (Row 1) are absent in these publications from the landfill perspective. CMSA, 2004; These publications are regarding hazard and risk These publications are not for landfills in the first place. All the36 Puncochar, 2003; Koivisto et. al., 2001; Feldman and White, 1996; CHEM Unit, 2003; Pauluhn, 1999; Muth et. al., 2001; Tarazona and Vega, 2002 assessment in the context of these respective subjects: mining, workplace, genetically modified organisms, neurology, indoor environment, ecology, toxicology, food, and chemicals. aforesaid elements are absent from the landfill leachate perspective.37 Figure 1: The Waste Hierarchy \u2013 The arrow points from the least preferred waste management option to the topmost priority (DoE and Welsh Office, 1995a; 1995b; SITA, 2004; Envirowise, 2005; SEPA, 2008) PREVENTION REDUCTION RE-USE RECOVERY \uf0b7 Recycling \uf0b7 Composting \uf0b7 Energy (recovered from the waste incineration, landfill gas combustion) DISPOSAL \uf0b7 Incineration without energy recovery \uf0b7 Landfill without gas energy recovery38 Figure 2: The Exposure Assessment Framework in relation to overall Risk Assessment Structure (Adapted, derived and concluded from the work of various authors including Peacock and Whyte, 1992; WDA, 1994; Tweeds, 1996; WHO, 1997; EPA, 2000; TOSC, 2000; CIRIA, 2001; Viswanathan et. al., 2002; CMSA, 2004) Hazard Identification Exposure Assessment Concentration Assessment Target \/ Receptor Identification & Categorisation Pathways\u2019 Identification & Categorisation Exposure Quantification \/ Measurement (via various exposure routes) Pollutants\u2019 Source Identification & Categorisation Inhalation Dermal Contact Others if any Ingestion Baseline Study Significance Assessment Uncertainty Assessment Risk Quantification Hazard Indices Risk Assessment \/ Analysis Migration Assessment","cites":null},{"id":37932583,"title":"Key Scottish Environment Statistics","authors":[],"date":"2004","doi":null,"raw":"Scottish Executive, Key Scottish Environment Statistics 2004 \u2013 A Scottish Executive National Statistics Publication, Crown Copyright, 2004","cites":null},{"id":37932518,"title":"Lancashire, Wales and Cheshire: our \u2018local\u2019 waste sites \u2013 We lift lid on real cost of rubbish recycling\u201d, Evening Express,","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":null,"raw":"Ewen, David. \u201cLancashire, Wales and Cheshire: our \u2018local\u2019 waste sites \u2013 We lift lid on real cost of rubbish recycling\u201d, Evening Express, p. 4 \u2013 5, (13 September) 2005","cites":null},{"id":37932539,"title":"Landcare Research (Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research \u2013 a New Zealand Crown Research Institute), Risk Assessment Model Reviews, http:\/\/www.contamsites.landcareresearch.co.nz\/ risk_assessment_models_reviews.htm,","authors":[],"date":"2003","doi":null,"raw":"Landcare Research (Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research \u2013 a New Zealand Crown Research Institute), Risk Assessment Model Reviews, http:\/\/www.contamsites.landcareresearch.co.nz\/ risk_assessment_models_reviews.htm, 2003","cites":null},{"id":37932503,"title":"LandSim 2.5 \u2013 groundwater risk assessment tool for landfill design, Environment Agency,","authors":[],"date":"2003","doi":null,"raw":"Environment Agency, LandSim 2.5 \u2013 groundwater risk assessment tool for landfill design, Environment Agency, Bristol. 2003d","cites":null},{"id":37932504,"title":"LandSim, Release 2 (V.2.02) \u2013 Landfill Performance Simulation by Monte Carlo Method,","authors":[],"date":"2001","doi":null,"raw":"Environment Agency, LandSim, Release 2 (V.2.02) \u2013 Landfill Performance Simulation by Monte Carlo Method, Environment Agency, R & D Publication 120, 2001","cites":null},{"id":37932648,"title":"Laxton\u2019s Guide to Risk Analysis & Management, (an imprint of ButterworthHeinemann),","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":null,"raw":"Tweeds, Laxton\u2019s Guide to Risk Analysis & Management, (an imprint of ButterworthHeinemann), 1996","cites":null},{"id":37932405,"title":"Managing Contaminated Sites: Problem Diagnosis and Development of Site Restoration,","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":"10.1177\/096032719701600610","raw":"Asante-Duah, D.

These wastes include\nindustrial, commercial and domestic waste streams. Although in some cases, wastes are reported of\nbeing reduced at regional level (Scottish Executive, 2004), unfortunately, on the whole, waste\nproduction is still on the increase in the UK (DoE and Welsh Office, 1995a; 1995b; Davies, 1999;\nDETR, 2000; Cabinet Office, 2002; DEFRA, 2003; 2005a; 2005b). Even if wastes are reduced at\nregional level, due to greenhouse gases \/ carbon emissions related to the transport of waste from the\npoint of production to recycling facilities and outlets, in some cases could out weigh the \u2018green\u2019\nadvantage of reuse and \/ or recycling. For instance, its been reported that the North East\u2019s waste in\nthe UK is being driven as far away as Wales for recycling (Ewen, 2005). Moreover, waste is the\ninescapable outcome of the activities which characterise human society; indeed in one sense it is an\nindicator of the health of modern economy (Tromans and Stiles, 2004). It can be safely said that no\nmatter now high we move up the Waste Hierarchy (which is described below), there will always be\nsome waste left for landfilling.\nSustainable waste management simply means managing waste by prioritising as per the Waste\nHierarchy, which is shown in Figure 1 (SEPA, 1999; DETR, 2000; Wilson, 2000; DEFRA, 2005a;\n2005b). This implies waste prevention is the top most priority if possible. The other priorities in\n3descending order are reduction; reuse; recovery via recycling, composting, energy; and disposal,\nwhich also includes landfilling. With reference to Figure 1, it must be noticed that the landfill waste\noption is not only occupying a place in the last group i.e. \u2018Disposal\u2019 but also in the second to the\nlast category up the Waste Hierarchy, i.e. \u2018Recovery\u2019.\nHaving established that waste production is an inevitable characteristic of an industrial society;\nmost of the waste produced, particularly in the UK (DETR, 2000), is generally disposed to landfills.\nWaste disposal to landfills, in general, is an easy and cheap waste management option. However,\nlandfilling does raise severe environmental concerns. One reason is that during the process of waste\ndegradation, landfills produce waste products in three phases. These are: Solid (i.e. more or less\ndegraded waste); Liquid (i.e. leachate, which is water polluted with wastes); and Gas (usually\nreferred to as landfill gas comprising e.g. Methane, Carbon-dioxide, Hydrogen-sulphide, etc.).\nFurthermore, landfills have the potential to pollute the three principal environmental media - the\natmosphere, the lithosphere and the hydrosphere. Such pollution will be transmitted through these\nmedia and will impact, either directly or indirectly, upon humans, the natural environment\n(including aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna) and the built environment (Moriarty, 1993; Butt\nand Oduyemi, 2003). Thus, the risks associated with landfills need to be assessed and managed to\nguard the environment against landfill hazards, not only for humans but also other receptors\nincluding flora, fauna, water and land or soils.\nOn the other hand, environmental legislation are not only becoming stricter and more stringent but\nalso have increasingly followed a global theme. Some examples of such legislation are listed below\nin chronological order. Some legislation are directly related to landfills (e.g. the Landfill Directive,\nthe Waste Management Licensing Regulations, the Environmental Protection Act, etc.) while others\n4indirectly. Directives cover not only the UK but also the other member states of the European\nUnion \/ Community.\n1. EC Directive on Groundwater (EC, 1980);\n2. EC Directive on EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) (EC, 1985);\n3. Environmental Protection Act, 1990;\n4. EC Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (The\nHabitats Directive) (EC, 1992);\n5. Waste Management Licensing Regulations (SI, 1994a; 2005);\n6. Environment Act, 1995;\n7. EU Directive on IPPC (Integrated Pollution Control and Prevention) (EU, 1996);\n8. Groundwater Regulations (SI, 1998);\n9. Landfill Directive (EC, 1999);\n10. Water Framework Directive, (EC, 2000);\n11. Landfill Regulations (SI, 2002; 2004; 2005; Scottish Executive et. al., 2005); and\n12. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive (ODPM, 2003)\nIn parallel to the growing environmental concerns and globalisation process described earlier,\nhaving realised the significance and effectiveness of risk assessment in environmental management,\nthe environmental legislation has started to impose risk analysis as a tool for meeting legal\nrequirements associated with waste hazards (Environment Agency, 2003a). For instance, for the\nprotection of groundwater from landfill leachate a risk assessment exercise has been introduced in\nthe UK as a legal requirement since 1st May 1994, through Regulation 15 of the Waste\nManagement Licensing Regulations (SI, 1994a) and the Groundwater Regulations (SI, 1998). The\nLandfill Directive is implemented in England and Wales through the Landfill Regulations (SI,\n2002), made under the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Act (England and Wales) 1999. The\n5overall aim of the Landfill Directive, which came out in 1999, is to prevent or reduce as far as\npossible negative impacts on the environment, in particular the pollution of surface water,\ngroundwater, soil and air, and on the global environment, including greenhouse effect, as well as\nany resulting risk to human health, from the landfilling of waste, during the whole life-cycle of the\nlandfill (CIWM, 2008). The equivalent legislation, which is called Landfill (Scotland) Regulations,\nhas come out in Scotland (SSI, 2000; 2003; SEPA, 2005a; 2005b). The equivalent legislation has\nalso been in place in Northern Ireland since 2003 (SR, 2003). It can be deduced from all these\nlegislative instruments that the \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 concept regarding wastes (i.e. simply and\nblindly buried into the ground and forgotten) is no longer applicable. To achieve the maximum\nprotection of the environment against the hazards associated with landfill sites, all potential hazards\nmust be identified and risks associated with them assessed.\nA risk assessment has two main aspects which are hazard assessment and risk estimation (CIRIA,\n2001). The former aspect generally focuses on identification of hazards\u2019 source, pathways and\nreceptors \/ targets. Where as the latter facet is to establish how likely it is that a given hazard would\nreach and hit the receptor \/ target via the pathway. Specifically in the former context, risk analysis\nhas been applied to a number of subjects for a long time. However, it is the latter aspect i.e. risk\nestimation part of risk assessment which is, comparatively, a new and rapidly growing science,\nparticularly in relation to probabilistic and statistical approaches. Thus, on the whole risk\nassessment, relatively, is a new and fast developing field of study (LaGoy, 1994; Tweeds, 1996;\nButt and Oduyemi, 2003). This is not just in relation to landfills and other environmental issues but\nalso in relation to other business fields including, food industry, ecology, epidemiology, health\nphysics, radiation, earthquakes, finance, construction management, building contract selection,\ninsurance, economics, fire, landslides, ship navigation, and oil industry (Rejda, 1995; Tweeds,\n1996; WHO, 1997; Mitchell, 1998; HSE, 1998; CIWEM, 1999; Brebbia, 2000; Butt and Oduyemi,\n2000; 2003; Butt et. al., 2006a). Regardless of the type of risk assessment and the environmental\n6area of application, one of the important parts of risk analysis is exposure assessment\n(Moschandreas et. al., 2002). In the literature review carried out by the authors (examples and\nfurther details are contained in Table 1 and Section 2.0), it was concluded that risk analysis\napproaches for landfill leachate do not have a holistic exposure assessment procedure aided with a\ncomputer model. A number of important elements of exposure assessment that are absent in risk\nanalysis approaches and computer models are also discussed below.\n1.2 Definition and Terminology Implications\nFigure 2 represents overall structure of risk analysis with a range of building blocks including\nbaseline study, hazard identification, exposure assessment, hazards\u2019 concentration assessment,\npollutants\u2019 migration assessment, significance assessment, uncertainty assessment, hazard indices,\nand risk quantification. In the UK the term generally used is risk assessment as opposed to risk\nanalysis which is more often referred to in the US. Therefore, the authors have noticed that both\nterms are used in literature interchangeably. Thus, this paper uses both risk assessment and risk\nanalysis terms interchangeably. This also helps to cover international audience rather than only\nnational.\nThe Figure shows position of exposure assessment in relation to overall risk analysis structure. The\nFigure also illustrates the other building blocks of risk assessment process. In the Figure, exposure\nassessment further branches out into its parts and sub-parts. The other building blocks are not the\nfocus of this paper thus their parts and sub-parts are beyond the scope of this paper.\nIn the context of landfill risk analysis, the authors describe an exposure assessment process as that\nfundamental stage of a risk assessment exercise in which a given landfill i.e. the pollutant source is\ncharacterised and, pathways and environmental receptors are identified and categorised. For this,\n7the basic information is to come from the baseline study module of the risk assessment where the\nrelevant information would have already been gathered by the risk assessor (Butt and Oduyemi,\n2000). Similarly, hazards \/ pollutants would have already been specified in the hazard identification\nsection of the risk assessment (Butt et. al., 2006b). In exposure assessment, in addition to\nidentification, characterisation and categorisation of the hazards\u2019 source, pathways and receptors \/\ntargets, exposures of the identified receptors to the identified hazards through identified pathways\nare also quantified to support the quantitative risk analysis. It is worth mentioning that the term\n\u2018holistic\u2019 in this paper implies an overall framework or system, covering all aspects and factors of\nthe exposure assessment from the point of view of leachate.\n2.0 LITERATURE ON RISK ANALYSIS AND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT\nLiterature on risk assessment that is related to environmental issues and specifically regarding\nlandfills has been the main focus of the review. This literature review includes, for instance,\nGregory et. al., 1999; Nathanail, 2003; Bardos et. al., 2003a; 2003b; Eduljee, 1998; Redfearn et. al.,\n2000; DoE, 1995; and CIRIA, 2001 (See more references in Table 1). In this study not only latest\nbut some old literature have also been considered in order to ensure if any developments on the\nsubject were made in the far past. The review of literature clearly shows that exposure assessment is\na crucial factor in an environmental risk analysis because hazards\u2019 source, pathways, and receptors\nhave to be specified and exposures have to be measured in order to be able to establish the degree\nand nature of risks. The following two sub-sections explain why the development of a strategic\nframework of exposure assessment is necessary for landfill leachate.\n2.1 Current and Future Legislation\n8Table 1 shows that the current literature (and computer models discussed in Section 3.0) regarding\nrisk analysis and exposure assessment are just about sufficient to meet the current legislation\nrequirements such as drinking water standards. The literature mainly considers humans as receptors.\nFurthermore, in terms of the development of an overall exposure assessment procedure, there is a\nlack of attention given to some other aspects. Some examples of such aspects are:\n\uf0b7 Receptors other than humans, such as aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna (like fish, crops);\n\uf0b7 Natural and yet non-living receptors such as land \/ soil, air, watercourses \/ groundwater, etc.;\n\uf0b7 Built environment comprising such as human-made ponds, buildings, and structures;\n\uf0b7 Water courses other than used by humans for drinking such as rivers of various water grades\n(SI, 1994b); and\n\uf0b7 Statistical descriptions for maximum and mean exposure quantification, in order to assist with\nmeasuring risks for worst case and most likely scenarios, respectively, in a risk analysis process.\nThe above listed areas become more important when future legislation is expected to be more\nstringent, inclusive and integrated (Section 1.0). For instance, the Water Framework Directive (EC,\n2000) will be transposed into the UK legislation in the near future. This Directive includes new\nrequirements for protection and restoration not only of ground waters but also surface waters and\ndependent ecological systems (Environment Agency, 2003a). Similarly, the Landfill Directive and\nRegulations take it even beyond surface and ground waters only, thereby, including air, soil, global\nenvironment, greenhouse gases, and human health on the top of surface and ground waters (EC,\n1999; SI, 2002; 2004; 2005; Scottish Executive et. al., 2005). Another directive, generally referred\nto as Habitat Directive (EC, 1992), brings legal obligation to combat hazards in order to guard and\nenhance natural habitats and wild fauna and flora. On basis of these examples of legislation which\nare tending to be a lot more holistic than ever before, it can be concluded that an even more\nintegrated approach towards exposure assessment and subsequently risk analysis is required.\n92.2 Non-integrated Literature on Exposure Assessment and Risk Assessment\nA review of environmental related literature led to the conclusion that a comprehensive, robust,\ndetailed and sound risk assessment methodology, with a number of essential features does not exist\nin an integrated manner. Examples of such essential features are listed below:\n\uf0b7 Encompassing various types of landfill systems and their surroundings\n\uf0b7 Taking into account all possible characteristics of landfills in terms of risks and\nquantification of risks posed by landfills\n\uf0b7 Embedding procedures of relevant modules (such as baseline study, hazard identification,\nhazards\u2019 concentration assessment, exposure analysis, pollutants migration, etc.). Figure 2\nillustrates these modules.\nA number of knowledge gaps have been found in the literature reviewed to date. One of the\ncommon gaps is an integrated and computer aided procedure for carrying out exposure assessment,\nspecifically for landfill leachate. The literature on exposure assessment to date is limited, indirect\nand in a piece-meal manner. The current literature accounts for different aspects of exposure\nanalysis to different levels of detail. The publications are non-integrated and independent of each\nother. Some publications (such as Redfearn et. al., 2000) focus on humans as receptors and only\nconsider inhalation exposure route, whereas other environmental species and exposure routes are\nexcluded. Some publications emphasise certain types of hazards and not all possible hazards (for\nexample, Moschandreas et. al., 2002 focus only on Particulate Matter (PM) hazard). In some\npublications, only multi-media and multi-pathway exposure and risk assessment of contamination\ndue to an industrial facility are discussed (e.g. Bagli and Spadoni, 2000). Some publications (such\nas Eduljee, 1998; DoE, 1995) consider exposure analysis in a general context and focus only on\n10\nhumans as receptors. Some literature concentrate on exposure from contaminated land perspective\nbut not specifically landfills. Further details are given in Table 1. In summary, there does not exist\nsuch an exposure assessment procedure, which allows integrated considerations of all the factors\nlisted in (the first row of) Table 1 for all environmental receptors, both living and non-living, via all\nexposure routes.\n3.0 COMPUTER MODELS OF RISK ANALYSIS AND EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT\nThe development of computational methods and the ability to model systems more precisely now\nenable hazards to be quantified, their effects to be simulated, and risk analysis to be pursued with\ngreater accuracy. This leads to a more effective risk management. These developments are not only\nimportant for all areas of human endeavour, but have particular relevance to environmental issues\nwhere the risks involved are increasingly seen as substantial. However, no evidence of a computer\nmodel of total risk assessment, which regards the knowledge gaps indicated in Section 2.0, has been\nfound. The case is identical in terms of computer modelling for exposure assessment alone, as\ndiscussed in detail later in this section. A computer model is seen as an electronic representation of\na methodology or procedure in this paper.\nThe investigation of various relevant computer models during the literature review led to the\nidentification of models that are closely related to landfill risk assessment. These models are\nLandSim (Environment Agency, 2003d; 2001), HELP (Scientific Software Group, 1998), GasSim\n(Attenborough et. al., 2002; Golder Associates, 2003), GasSimLite (Environment Agency, 2002)\nand RIP (Golder Associates, 1998; Landcare Research, 2003). The first four computer models were\nspecifically designed for landfills, although the features of the RIP (Repository Integration\nProgramme) were subsequently extended to take landfills into account on a comparatively large\nscale. While other software types studied are not demonstrably related to landfill risks, they could\n11\nstill be used to an extent to investigate some aspects of landfill exposure assessments and\nconsequently risk assessments.\nAs far as software packages addressing landfill risk assessment are concerned they do not\nholistically encapsulate all elements of risk analysis methodology for landfills, including that of\nexposure assessment. However, some of the computer models could deal with some aspects of\nexposure assessment for landfills. For example, the RIP, which is an integrated probabilistic\nsimulator for environmental systems, has been designed generally for any potential pollutant source\nin the ground e.g. a chemical storage tank. So with the RIP, which is a generic software model, risk\nassessors have to adapt it to their specific problems (such as landfills). This adaptation is time\nconsuming and it is not an easy task for everyone (Miller, 1998). The RIP has features, which\nembrace source, pathway and receptor. This it does in terms of likely concentrations of hazards\nleaking from the source, migrating via a pathway, and reaching and entering receptors. However,\nthe RIP does not readily provide such a straightforward exposure assessment procedure for landfill\nleachate where a landfill assessor could identify and categorise hazards\u2019 source (that is a given\nlandfill), pathways (mainly exposure media) and receptors. In the same manner, it also does not\nreadily provide for a consideration of statistical descriptions for maximum and mean exposure\nvalues.\nOn the other hand the LandSim model, which is purely for landfill risk assessment, does not embed\nall parts of a landfill risk assessment process, including that of exposure assessment. LandSim just\nprobabilistically estimates the likely concentration of a leachate pollutant that can reach a given\npoint in the ground (for example a groundwater abstraction point) in a certain time, in terms of\nyears. It does not allow for the quantification of exposure such as what would be the degree of\nexposure for people (or livestock) if they were to consume this groundwater. Therefore, the\nLandSim\u2019s characteristic of pollutant concentration estimation in an exposure medium such as\n12\ngroundwater can be taken a step further to quantify exposure to, for instance, live-stock or a fish\nfarm, which would make quantitative risk assessment more comprehensive. This way, a holistic\nexposure assessment methodology can be useful to further build on the information obtained from a\nsoftware model such as LandSim. Similarly, HELP (Hydro-geological Evaluation of Landfill\nPerformance) model contains only some aspects of landfill risk assessment. These are mainly the\ndesign features of landfill (such as liners and capping) and some of the baseline study aspects (like\nprecipitation and surface runoff). However, it does not consider a very important aspect of risk\nassessment, that is an exposure assessment system. Although the software GasSim deals with some\naspects of risk assessment modules, including gas generation, migration, impact and exposure, it is\nonly for landfill gas and not leachate. Also, the exposure aspect regards mainly humans and\natmosphere as receptors and no other environmental species are accounted for. GasSimLite is also\nfrom the perspective of landfill gas only and can be used only in terms of calculating gas emissions.\nConSim model is a tool for assessing the risks that are posed to groundwater quality by pollutants\nmigrating from contaminated land (Whittaker et. al., 2001). The authors learnt that this is not\nspecifically for landfills in the first place, particularly when landfills have leachate head and \/ or\nliners, which is a likely scenario with modern landfills (Environment Agency, 2003b). Also, this\nmodel does not accommodate receptors other than groundwater. The CLEA (Contaminated Land\nExposure Assessment) model considers risks only to human health and not other environmental\nreceptors such as plants, animals, buildings and controlled waters (Environment Agency, 2003c).\nPathways are seen only from the perspective of soil as an exposure medium and not leachate\n(Environment Agency et. al., 2002). Also, this model has been developed for contaminated land and\nnot specifically for landfills (DEFRA and Environment Agency, 2002). Other elements such as\nnumber 5 mentioned in the first row of Table 1 are absent in the model.\n13\nSADA (Spatial Analysis and Decision Assistance) is a software that incorporates tools from\nenvironmental assessment fields into an effective problem solving environment (TIEM, 2006).\nThese tools include integrated modules for visualisation, geo-spatial analysis, statistical analysis,\nhuman health risk assessment, ecological risk assessment, cost \/ benefit analysis, sampling design,\nand decision analysis. Out of this wide range of tools or modules, only two most possibly relevant\nare selected to describe here as examples. The Human Health Risk module provides a full human\nhealth risk assessment and associated databases from a range of land-use scenarios. These include\nresidential, industrial, agricultural, recreational, and excavation but not specifically landfills.\nEcological Risk is another module or unit of the SADA which allows users to perform benchmark\nscreenings and the ability to calculate forward risk to a number of terrestrial and aquatic receptors\nthat are currently being added. Even after this module has been fully developed, it may only be\nhelpful to an extent to address a few aspects of landfill exposure assessments. For instance, assisting\nin identifying a whole range of environmental receptors (both aquatic and terrestrial) and yet for\nhumans as receptors, the user still will have to consult the former module i.e. Human Health Risk\nmodule. SADA appears to inhouse a number of various software to address a range of different risk\nscenarios. Thus, a landfill assessor will have to work on picking the right combinations of these\ndifferent software each time they are carrying out a landfill exposure analysis and yet SADA will\nnot provide for each and every facet of landfill exposure assessment in a readily useable format.\nMoreover, as the title \u2018Spatial Analysis and Decision Assistance (SADA)\u2019states, the focus appears\nto be more on spatial than temporal.\nARAMS (Adaptable Risk Assessment Modelling System) is a computer-based, modelling and\ndatabase driven analysis system developed for the US Army for estimating the human and\necological health impacts and risk associated with military relevant compounds (MRCs) and other\nconstituents (ERDC, 2006). ARAMS takes various existing databases and models for exposure,\nintake \/ update, and effects (health impacts) and incorporates them into conceptual site-models. The\n14\nuser may need to choose which particular model and \/ or database to use for each scenario. The\nheart of ARAMS is the object-oriented Conceptual Site Model (CSM) but that relies yet on another\ncomputer programme called FRAMES discussed below. Thus it is not an easy task to adapt\nARAMS into a landfill leachate scenario every time if a landfill assessor decides to use ARAMS.\nAlthough, ARAMS appears to concentrate mostly on the exposure assessment facet of risk analysis,\nit does not cover all the elements indicated in Table 1 (Row 1, last column) in an algorithmic\nfashion, specifically for landfills. Similarly, MEPAS (Multimedia Environmental Pollutant\nAssessment System) is another computer-based programme which is a suite of environmental\nmodels developed to assess contaminated environmental problems for government, industrial, and\ninternational clients (PNNL, 2006a). Although, the software integrates transport and exposure\npathways for chemical and radioactive releases to determine their potential impact on the\nsurrounding environment, individuals, and populations. In the context of landfills, the situation with\nMEPAS is not much different than ARAMS. Both the computer programmes are not to and do not\npresent an overall exposure assessment methodology of landfill leachate.\nFRAMES (Framework for Risk Analysis Multimedia Environmental Systems) is a software\nplatform for selecting and implementing environmental software models for risk assessment and\nmanagement problems which may even include governance issues (Evangelidis, 2003). In other\nwords, the purpose of FRAMES is to assist users in developing environmental scenarios and to\nprovide options for selecting the most appropriate computer codes to conduct human and\nenvironmental risk management analyses (PNNL, 2006b). This program is a flexible tool and offers\nan overall approach to understanding how industrial activities affect humans and the environment. It\nincorporates models that integrate across scientific disciplines, allowing for tailored solutions to\nspecific activities, and it provides meaningful information to business and technical managers.\nFRAMES is the key to identifying, analysing, and managing potential environmental, safety and\nhealth risks. Thus, FRAMES is a hugely generic programme, and yet it does not contain a software\n15\nfor landfill leachate scenario which could guide a landfill assessor to perform a landfill exposure\nanalysis holistically including all the factors (mentioned in Row 1, Table 1) in one place.\nThe RESRAD is a combination of two words RESidual and RADiation (DMS, 2006), which is used\nas an acronym for Residual Radiation environmental analysis (Farlex, 2006). The RESRAD is a\nfamily of computer codes or modules to provide a scientifically based assessment of degree of\ncleanliness and to equip with useful tools for evaluating human health risk from residual\ncontamination (EAD, 2006a). These codes or modules include (EAD, 2006a; 2006b):\n1. RESRAD, for soil contaminated with radio-nuclides;\n2. RESRADBUILD, for buildings contaminated with radio-nuclides;\n3. RESRAD-CHEM, for soil contaminated with hazardous chemicals;\n4. RESRADBASELINE, for risk assessments against measured (baseline) concentrations of both\nradio-nuclides and chemicals in environmental media;\n5. RESRAD-ECORISK, for ecological risk assessments;\n6. RESRAD-RECYCLE, for recycle and reuse of radio-logically contaminated metals and\nequipment; and\n7. RESRAD-OFFSITE, for off-site receptor dose \/ risk assessment.\nFrom the above it is obvious that none of the family members is specifically for landfill leachate,\nalthough addressing a range of various environmental issues and aspects. Even if these codes or\nmodules are used in combination, they are not able to address all the features of exposure analysis\nof landfill leachate expressed in Table 1, Row 1. Furthermore, to combine these into a landfill\nleachate context alone would be a cumbersome task to execute each time an exposure assessment\nand risk analysis are performed for different landfill scenarios. For instance, RESRAD-CHEM\nconsiders nine exposure pathways including inhalation of dust and volatiles; ingestion of plant\n16\nfoods, meat, milk, soil, aquatic food and water; and dermal absorption from soil and water contact.\nThis code may help address aspects of exposure assessment, but not all the absent elements (listed\nin the first row, last column, Table 1) in an integrated format. However, this code is no longer being\nupdated (EAD, 2006c).\nRISC-HUMAN 3.1, RUM and Vlier-Humaan (Van Hall Instituut of Business Center, 2000, 2001,\nand 2002, respectively) are another three computer models developed for exposure assessment and\nrisk analysis, but they have been built for contaminated land and not specifically for landfills. Only\nhumans are considered as receptor in these software. Other potential environmental receptors such\nas watercourses and built environment have not been taken into consideration in these software. The\naggregation aspect (i.e. total exposure of the same receptor via various routes as mentioned in Point\n2b, first row of Table 1) and statistical considerations (Point 5, first row of Table 1) are also absent.\nIn summary, the authors have come across no integrated computer model of a holistic exposure\nassessment procedure which could assist to execute the exposure analysis process specifically for a\ngiven landfill leachate from start to end considering a whole range of eventualities and \/ or\nscenarios. Currently available computer models lack the elements indicated in the first row of Table\n1, either completely or partly. These absent elements or knowledge gaps require to be further\ninvestigated and bridged. Also, current computer models do not present such a concise exposure\nassessment model for landfill leachate, which as a complete unit, could readily be assembled with\nthe format of other modules and sub-modules of the total risk assessment framework indicated in\nFigure 2. In parallel to the literature (Section 2.0), computer models are also available in non-\nintegrated manner. Thus, not only having a holistic procedure of exposure assessment but also a\ncorresponding computer model in an integrated format, specifically for landfill leachate, which\nencapsulates all the absent elements (Row 1, Table 1) under one umbrella, can help perform\n17\nquantitative exposure analysis more effectively and efficiently. Subsequently, this will assist risk\nanalysis process.\n4.0 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nDespite having high potentials to pollute the environment, landfills are inevitable and required.\nTherefore, risk assessment and management is an effective tool to guard the environment against\nlandfill hazards. However, there does not exist such an integrated methodology of landfill risk\nanalysis along with a corresponding knowledge-based computer model, which is helpful enough to\nexecute the process of risk assessment for landfill leachate from the start (i.e. baseline study)\nthrough exposure assessment to the end (i.e. hazard indices and risk quantification). A number of\nknowledge gaps have been identified in the literature reviewed to date and a holistic exposure\nassessment procedure accompanied with a corresponding computer model is one of them. The\nexposure assessment is one of the most important factors of an effective and quantitative risk\nanalysis, as the success of the latter is based on the former.\nCurrent literature and models are just about enough to meet the risk assessment requirements of the\npresent environmental legislation in the UK. Future legislation is going to be more stringent and\nwider in scope to encapsulate more environmental species such as various food chain links,\necological systems, terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna. Therefore a more comprehensive,\nconcise and robust risk analysis system underpinned by more strategic exposure assessment\napproach will be needed. This research work assists the authors to recognise the necessity and\nsignificance of exposure assessment; and identify knowledge gaps and current models\u2019 limitations.\nThereby, lay foundation for developing in future a more complete and sequential or step-by-step\nprocedure for quantitative exposure assessment in an integrated fashion specifically for landfill\n18\nleachate. This study may also be helpful to construct a corresponding holistic computer model of\nexposure analysis.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of Dundee City Council in this project.

This publication just outlines\nthe main contents of exposure assessment for any type of\ncontaminated land, but does not present a robust and\nobjective procedure of carrying out exposure assessment\nfor landfills or any contaminated land with items as listed\nin the adjacent column 3 of this table.\nFrom the term \u2018elements absent\u2019 the author imply knowledge gaps and\nlimitations in the research works to date with regard to exposure\nassessments from the perspective of landfill exposure analysis.\n1. There is absence of an identification and categorisation procedure\nof pollutants at source (i.e. a given landfill), pathways (including\nexposure medium and exposure routes such as ingestion, dermal,\ninhalation), and receptors \/ targets are absent.\n2. (a). There is a deficiency of a system for measuring or quantifying\nexposure of receptors to hazards, covering all possible exposure\nroutes via which hazards can possibly enter receptors\u2019 boundaries.\n(b). There is no function or facility that allows exposures from\nvarious individual exposure routes to be aggregated for a given\nreceptor exposed to a given hazard.\n3. There is no consideration given to assess significance of and likely\nuncertainties involved in the elements, particularly exposure\nmeasurement, indicated above.\n(a). Significance assessment plays a role in screening out\ninsignificant parameters e.g. which pathway and \/ or receptor is\nnegligible to consider in an exposure analysis process, and\nconsequently the risk assessment process.\n(b). Whereas the uncertainty assessment assists to identify\n29\nuncertainties involved in measuring a parameter, for instance,\nmodels\u2019 limitations, estimation methods\u2019 assumptions, data quality,\netc.\n4. There are no provisions for exposure assessment to assist with\nmeasuring both worst case and most likely risk scenarios.\n5. The application and integration of concepts of maximum, mean and\nminimum exposures are not included. In other words, engagement\nof statistical descriptions that can help address issues of\nuncertainties, and temporal and spatial variations.\n6. It is not in the remit of the publication to offer a holistic computer\nmodel of an integrated exposure analysis system for landfill\nleachate which contains all the aforesaid features or elements.\nGolder\nAssociates,\n2002\nThis publication regards risk assessment only for small and\nclosed landfills. It briefly mentions hazards and risks in the\ncontext of contamination of groundwater; contamination of\nsurface water; gas accumulation; and direct exposure to\ncontaminated soil, sharp objects or hazardous gases. These\nare the only four scenarios, which this publication\naddresses very briefly.\nThere is no strategic procedure to carry out exposure assessment process\nin a quantitative manner for landfill leachate, which could take account\nof all possible scenarios. There is lack of in-depth algorithmic exposure\nquantification system that sequentially ties together the factors involved\nsuch as exposure duration, frequency, exposure media and routes. In\nsummary, it is not in remit of this publication to address all the elements\nmentioned above (in Row 1) in a holistic format specifically for landfill\nleachate.\nCIRIA, 2001 This publication is only for closed landfill sites. The\npublication contains a chapter specifically on risk\nassessment, which also contains a brief section on exposure\nThere is no procedure for exposure assessment.\n30\nassessment where main factors of exposure analysis are\nonly mentioned.\nEnvironment\nAgency, 2003a\nProvides guideline for landfill risk assessment and only for\ngroundwater as receptor. Identifies some fundamental\nrequirements of risk assessment on, for example, geology,\nhydrogeology, and site investigation.\nThough a guideline on landfill risk assessment exists but it is not for\nconsidering receptors other than groundwater. Though this publication\nrelates to risk assessment for landfill leachate, but it is not holistic in the\nform of a methodology or ready-to-use procedure. There are no\nconsiderations of quantification of exposure and risk. The computer\nmodelling aspect of the publication (i.e. LandSim) is discussed in\nSection 3.0.\nDETR et. al.,\n2000\nAs the document states itself that it provides material, in\ngeneral, for the development of risk analysis guidance to\nassist issues like contaminated land, waste management,\nmajor accident hazards.\nThe publication addresses a range of issues in general (listed in the left\ncolumn) but not specifically for landfills or landfill leachate. The\nobjective of this publication is not to develop an integrated exposure\nassessment to assist quantitative risk analysis. In summary, in the\ncontext of landfill leachate all the elements above (Row 1) are not in the\nremit of this publication.\nDEFRA and\nEnvironment\nAgency, 2002\nThis publication relates to exposure assessment for humans\nfrom contaminated lands. Details on various aspects of\nexposure assessment are given. Examples are exposure\nparameters (such as exposure duration, frequency), soil\nrelease and transfer mechanisms, exposure equations,\nhuman activities and ages, exposure routes, various land-\nuses.\nDeals in detail with humans as receptors, but not other environmental\nspecies and eco-systems. Element number 5 above is also not there. It is\nnot specifically landfill leachate. It is for contaminated land in general.\nEnvironment This document briefly addresses a broad and diverse range A holistic exposure assessment procedure accompanied with a\n31\nAgency, 2004 of facets of landfill risk analysis along social, technical,\nenvironmental, economic, and legislative and managerial\nthemes. Both landfill gas and leachate are addressed. The\nmain scope of the guidance is limited to five areas of risk\nanalysis, which are accidents and their consequences;\nhydrogeology; landfill gas; particulate matter; and stability.\nThe document briefly touches on elements like source,\npathway and receptors yet not as parts of exposure\nassessment system.\ncorresponding computer model is not in the remit of this publication.\nThere is no allowance for exposure quantification. Statistical\ndescriptions like maximum, mean and minimum exposures are not in the\nscope either. As the document states itself that there are five main areas,\nwhich constitute the main remit of the guidance (listed in the left\ncolumn). Yet landfill leachate is not one of them though is addressed to\nan extent. The guidance also mentions that it does not provide all the\ndetail needed to conduct risk analysis for a landfill and the same holds\nfor exposure assessment.\nGregory, R. G.\net. al., 1999\nThis publication is for risk analysis of landfill gas only.\nConcerns mainly humans as receptors. Engages with some\nrisk assessment modules such as gas generation, human\nexposure assessment with quantification aspect, pollutants\u2019\nmigration.\nThe risk quantification aspect is absent. It is not for landfill leachate.\nElement 5 above is not embedded, even for landfill gas. From a leachate\nperspective, all the aforesaid elements are absent.\nMoschandreas\net. al., 2002\nFocuses on one type of hazard i.e. Particulate Matter (PM)\nand only in air as an exposure medium. The only exposure\nroute accounted for is inhalation and considers only\nhumans as receptors.\nDoes not present exposure assessment as an overall procedure and\nspecially element 5 above is not included. This publication is not\nspecifically for landfills. As mentioned in the corresponding left\nadjacent cell, consideration of types of hazard, exposure medium,\nexposure route, and receptor is very limited.\nBagli and\nSpadoni, 2000\nThis publication takes account of industrial facilities as\npollutant source and humans as receptors. It touches on\nvarious aspects of exposure assessment including exposure\nroutes, equations and quantification. Also briefly writes\nIt is not for landfills at all. Exposure assessment is not presented as an\noverall procedure. Receptors other than humans have not been included.\nIn the context of landfill leachate all the elements mentioned above are\nabsent as well.\n32\nabout risk assessment in the light of GIS (Geographical\nInformation System).\nRedfearn et.\nal., 2000\nThis publication, which is a paper, is related to risk\nassessment and thus also briefly mentions Exposure\nAssessment. However this publication is related to landfill\ngas and not leachate. Thus, it focuses on exposure route of\ninhalation only. Also, it identifies some sensitivities and\nuncertainties associated with Exposure Assessment.\nApart from a very limited section on exposure assessment, there is no\nprocedure for describing how to perform exposure analysis process. All\nthe elements mentioned above are absent from the perspective of\nleachate. Although the first four elements are partly addressed to an\nextent, but the consideration is from the landfill gas perspective.\nDoE, 1995 This publication portrays Exposure Assessment in a\nholistic manner, more than any other literature studied to\ndate. However, the focus is not all environmental receptors\nbut human health only. Similarly, not all potential\npathways have been included, but only six exposure\npathways which cover most risks to human health from\nlandfills.\nDoes not present an exposure assessment procedure in a holistic manner,\nin the form of a computer model, that is element number 6 (above in\nRow 1) is absent. Does not take account of all environmental receptors\nsuch as flora and fauna, but only humans. With reference to point 2\nabove. This publication does not seem to have a facility where all\nindividual exposures via various corresponding individual exposure\nroutes, could be summed up to determine total exposure for a given\nreceptor exposed to a given hazard. Does not take account of statistical\naspects as indicated in point 5 above.\nEduljee, 1998 A procedure on exposure assessment has been outlined\nwhich covers elements like 1 and 2 (listed above) to\nvarious levels of detail. However, only humans have been\nconsidered as receptors.\nNo computer model exists for the exposure assessment procedure in a\nholistic manner. Elements 3, 4 and 5 above are absent and element 2 is\naddressed to a limited extent. The procedure presented excludes various\nenvironmental receptors such as flora, fauna and the built environment.\nAsante-Duah,\n1996\nEncircles all important aspects of risk analysis and\nmanagement (including exposure assessment) of\nNot specifically for landfills. Also all the elements above are absent.\n33\ncontaminated lands, but not in the form of a methodology.\nThe various aspects have been considered as independent\nof each other.\nDaugherty,\n1998\nContains details not only of exposure but also those of\nsources (of hazards), pathways and receptors in separate\nchapters.\nThis publication, like others, does not depict exposure assessment in the\nform of a procedure that a risk assessor could use to measure exposure.\nThe publication is not specifically for landfills. Moreover, all the\nelements above are absent.\nEnvironment\nAgency, 2003e\nThis landfill risk assessment publication is from the\nperspective of issues including noise, odour, litter, birds,\nvermin, insects, and mud on road.\nThe publication is not about landfill leachate in the first place. The\nelements indicated in Row 1 above thus are not in the scope of the\npublication.\nBernard et. al.,\n1996; 1997\nThese two papers (Part 1 and 2) are on hazard analysis of\nlandfill leachate. They discuss leachates from 25 landfills\nin France as case studies with a number of methods of\ndetermining leachate toxicity and then comparing the\nphysico-chemical characteristics of leachates.\nAlthough, the techniques identified on measuring toxicity of landfill\nleachate can be useful in exposure assessment for a given landfill. But\nthese papers still are not to present procedures for exposure analysis and\nthe elements expressed above are not addressed in an integrated manner.\nEPD, 1997 This publication is a guideline for hazard analysis of\nlandfill gas. It briefly covers various aspects of hazard and\nrisk assessment such as hazard mitigation measures and\nsource-pathway-target analysis approach.\nThe publication is not for landfill leachate. Even for landfill gas the\naforesaid elements are either completely absent or very few are partly\ncovered to limited extent (as mentioned in the left column).\nKavazanjian\net. al., 1995;\nEisenbeis, et.\nal., 1986;\nIn addition to other old literature on landfill assessment\ndiscussed earlier in this paper, these were also investigated\nto make sure if there was any work done on exposure\nanalysis, relatively further in the past. These have been\nThese publications cover various aspects and factors of risk assessments\n(including exposure analysis) to varying degrees. However, none of\nthem appear to present a holistic system of exposure assessment process\nin a quantitative manner for landfill leachate, which could take account\n34\nJaggy, 1996;\nWDA, 1994;\nLaGoy, 1994;\nDOE, 1994;\nand Pieper et.\nal., 1997.\nfound to address various risk assessment issues like seismic\nhazard analysis for landfills; risk assessment itself; landfill\ntype and nature; contaminated land remediation; hazardous\nwastes; HWIR (Hazardous Waste Identification Rule); and\nspecific hazards such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins\nand furans (PCDD\/F).\nof all possible scenarios and elements indicated in Row 1 above.\nSEPA, 2002 This publication regards landfill risk assessment in the\ncontext of landfill leachate liners and drainage systems.\nThis publication is not to describe a strategic procedure to carry out\nexposure assessment process in a quantitative manner.\nCPPD, 2004 Currently the publication is in a draft form. It regards\nhazard and risk assessment in the context of natural hazards\nsuch as flooding, earthquake, landslides, wildfire.\nThe publication is not for anthropogenic activities in the first place.\nTherefore does not consider landfills at all. Though discusses various\nnatural hazards with statistics but does not present a structured exposure\nanalysis procedure even for the natural hazards covered.\nRudland et. al.,\n2001\nDescribes a basic framework for the risk assessment of\ncontaminated land.\nNot for landfills in specific. All the elements above (Row 1) are absent.\nAuckland\nRegional\nCouncil, 2002\nThis publication, which is a government document for\nlocal authorities, covers risk assessment in a very broad\nsense of hazards. These include natural hazards such as\ntornado, flooding, earthquake; technological hazards like\nhigh pressure gas mains, computer systems failure;\nbiological hazards including disease amongst people,\nanimals or plants; and civil \/ political hazards comprising\nterrorism and civil unrest.\nThe publication is not specifically for landfills. It just encapsulates all\nnatural and anthropogenic hazards without presenting a holistic\nprocedure either for exposure assessment or risk analysis. The format is\nmore like a checklist.\nDOE, 1998 This environmental guidance mentions Risk-Based The purpose of this document is not the development of a holistic\n35\nCorrective Action (RBCA) standards developed for\naddressing petroleum and chemical releases. The purpose\nof this guide is to explain risk-based decision making and\nthe RBCA process for environmental restoration of\nchemically contaminated sites.\nexposure assessment methodology. The system presented is not for\nlandfills as such. The system emphasises more on determining the data\nrequired for technical decision making rather than on following specific\nsteps of exposure assessment process as indicated in the aforesaid\nelements in Row 1.\nEPA, 1998;\nEPA, 1996a;\n1996b; 1996c.\nThese four documents are regarding risk assessments of\nneurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, ecology and\ncarcinogens, respectively.\nThough these documents may be useful in exposure assessment and risk\nanalysis of landfill leachate in the context of establishing neurotoxicity,\nreproductive toxicity, ecological and carcinogenic affects of leachate\npollutants. However, these publications are not produced specifically\nfrom the point of view of landfill leachate. Thus, there is no integrated\nprocedure to carry out exposure analysis process in a quantitative\nmanner for landfill leachate, which could take account of all possible\nscenarios and the elements indicated above in Row 1.\nEPA, 1992;\n1999\nThese publications are purely for exposure assessment.\nThus, they encircle the subject from many different\nperspectives including not only aspects of hazards,\npathways, receptors and exposures; but also types of doses\n(e.g. potential dose, intake dose, applied dose), exposure\ndose relationships, uncertainty assessment, individual and\npopulation exposure, exposure analysis in epidemiological\nstudies, and position of the exposure assessment itself with\nrespect to risk characterisation.\nAlthough these publications focus purely on exposure assessment, the\ndocuments do not portray a holistic procedure for carrying out exposure\nanalysis. Neither specifically for landfills nor for any other\nenvironmental risk analysis. All the elements above (Row 1) are absent\nin these publications from the landfill perspective.\nCMSA, 2004; These publications are regarding hazard and risk These publications are not for landfills in the first place.
