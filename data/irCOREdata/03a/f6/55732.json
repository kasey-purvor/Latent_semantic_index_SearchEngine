Introduction 36 \n 37 \nIn many industrialised countries the majority of mining environmental problems are 38 \nlegacies of the past1. The recognition of the extensive nature of the environmental 39 \nimpacts, which threaten local ecosystems and human health has driven initiatives for 40 \nremediation, e.g. the USGS Abandoned Mine Lands Initiative1, 2 and the UK 41 \nrecognition of the impact of historic metal sites in the context of the Water 42 \nFramework Directive (2000\/60\/EC 3). Releases of polluting substances that cannot be 43 \neasily traced back to a discrete contaminant source are referred to as diffuse 44 \npollutants. Diffuse source water pollution from current and historic mining activities 45 \ncan severely impact the water quality especially with regards to acidification and 46 \nmetal loading 4, 5 6, 7. This has particular relevance in the context of the Water 47 \nFramework Directive (2000\/60\/EC), which aims to achieve \u201cgood status\u201d for all 48 \nsurface waters (ecological [physico-chemical, biological, specific pollutant and 49 \nhydromorphological] and chemical components) and groundwaters (quantitative and 50 \nchemical components) by 2015. In order to implement effective mine water 51 \nmanagement programmes the extent and distribution of diffuse sources of 52 \ncontaminants is required 8. Determining the nature and extent of the diffuse 53 \ncontributions within a catchment can be difficult and requires a multidisciplinary 54 \napproach2. If it was possible to identify a homogeneous catchment the impact of both 55 \nPage 3 of 41 \n \npoint and diffuse contaminant loading would be cumulative and the signature of point 56 \nsource loading would be spiked, whereas that of diffuse loading would be incremental 57 \n(Figure 1). In practice, catchments are not homogeneous and the contaminant loading 58 \nmay be subject to a combination of point and diffuse inputs, non-conservative 59 \nbehaviour, as well as dilution where the stream passes through contaminant-free 60 \nstretches of the catchment. Consequently, more complex contaminant loading patterns 61 \nresult. An added variable is that of seasonality, which results from variations in 62 \ngroundwater residence times.  63 \n 64 \nThis paper addresses the difficulty of discriminating between diffuse and point source 65 \nimpacts of historical mining of lead-zinc mineralization on the water quality in the 66 \ncontext of the Rookhope Burn, a southerly flowing tributary of the River Wear, North 67 \nPennine, UK. Sources of contaminated drainage have been identified through reviews 68 \nof earlier work on the catchment 9-11 and through synoptic monitoring and chemical 69 \nanalysis. The results of the analyses have been interpreted in the context of the 70 \ngeological setting and used to determine the importance of individual sources of 71 \ncontaminated drainage and identify the existence of natural attenuation processes 72 \nwithin the catchment. 73 \n 74 \nThe Northumbria River Basin District Management Plan 12 identified the Rookhope 75 \nBurn as being at risk of moderate ecological status. The secondary groundwater body 76 \nthat underlies the catchment has been identified as being at risk from mines and 77 \nminewater pressures. 78 \n 79 \nPage 4 of 41 \n \nData published by 9, 10, 13, together with historic water quality data provided by the 80 \nEnvironment Agency indicate that the key contaminant of concern within the 81 \nRookhope catchment is Zn. Zn is of particular concern in the context of its 82 \nenvironmental impact, especially in the aquatic environment, owing to its toxicity to 83 \naquatic biota. This is acknowledged in its \u201cspecific pollutant\u201d designation in the 84 \nEuropean Water Framework Directive (2000\/60\/EC). The current UK EQS 85 \n(Environmental Quality Standard) for Zn ranges from 0.008 to 0.125 mg\/ l, the higher 86 \nvalue reflecting the beneficial effect of hardness (EC Dangerous Substances Directive 87 \n76\/464\/EEC, Table 2b). The maximum point source contribution of Zn to the 88 \nRookhope Burn (2.42 mg\/l) is comparable with peak concentrations determined in 89 \nother mining-affected watercourses, e.g Lapus River catchment northwestern 90 \nRomania 14, South Korea 15, but do not reach the concentrations reported in run-off 91 \nwaters monitored in Cabezo Rajao, in Southeast Spain 16.   However, it should be 92 \nnoted that concern with respect to the impacts of Zn being over estimated has 93 \nencouraged further research with respect to the EQS in the context of zinc\u2019s \u201cspecific 94 \npollutant\u201d status 17, 18, which allows due consideration of natural background and 95 \nbioavailability concentrations in the determination of the EQS. 96 \n 97 \n2. The Rookhope Catchment 98 \n 99 \nSituated towards centre of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 100 \ndesignation, the Rookhope catchment exemplifies the mining industrial heritage of the 101 \narea. The source of the catchment lies within grouse moorlands at an elevation of 102 \napproximately 600 to 540 m OD. Below this, the area is characterised by a relatively 103 \ntreeless landscape primarily given over to hill farming. The catchment bears the scars 104 \nPage 5 of 41 \n \nof abandoned quarries and mine workings, including: numerous mounds of rock and 105 \nmine waste; remnants of open vein workings; remnants of former mill buildings; 106 \ndisused shafts, and areas of former leats (artificial water channels). Settlement is 107 \nlargely focused on the areas of Rookhope and Eastgate with additional isolated 108 \nfarmsteads. Many of the farms were also once utilised for mining, for example Wolf 109 \nCleugh and Lintzgarth (Table 2). 110 \n 111 \nThe catchment is underlain by mineralized Dinantian (Brigantian and Asbian) 112 \nlimestones, capped by Namurian sandstones and mudstones of the Yoredale Group 19  113 \n(Table 1). Strata are almost horizontal, with a slight regional dip to the east. The 114 \nStainmore and Alston formations comprise sequences of limestone, mudstone, 115 \nsiltstone and sandstone, with occasional developments of seat earth and coal. The 116 \nlimestones are typically only a few metres thick and become increasingly common 117 \ntowards the base of the Stainmore Formation. The Great Limestone is up to 15 m 118 \nthick and the Alston Formation is dominated by thick limestones. Mineralization is 119 \nhosted by faults, which are typically normal and of limited vertical throw, and by 120 \nlocal occurrences, associated with the limestone, of horizontal mineral replacement 121 \nreferred to as flats. Primary minerals include galena, quartz, and siderite with traces of 122 \nsphalerite, pyrite, and localised chalcopyrite. Secondary minerals include: limonite, 123 \npsilomelane, cerrusite, malachite and occasionally azurite. Where flats have formed, 124 \nsignificant quantities of fluorite, galena and calcite together with some quartz and 125 \nchalcedonic silica may be present. 126 \n 127 \nPage 6 of 41 \n \nSuperficial deposits comprise: glacial till below ~370 m OD; river terrace deposits 128 \nassociated with the River Wear; ribbons of alluvial deposits associated with all of the 129 \nriver valleys, and blanket peat, which caps the higher ground 20. Anthropogenic 130 \ndeposits, including mine waste and construction materials associated with both mining 131 \nand railway construction, are also evident throughout. 132 \n 133 \nThe Rookhope catchment comprises an area in the order of 37 km2 and the southerly 134 \nflowing stream contributes a discharge ranging from 100 to 2300 l\/s to the River Wear 135 \nat Eastgate (Figure 2). Rainfall and temperature vary with altitude. An annual 136 \neffective rainfall of ~1000 mm has been calculated for Eastgate with monthly 137 \neffective rainfall varying between 53 and 116 mm.  The hydrograph for the Rookhope 138 \nBurn is flashy, i.e. there are frequent, rapid, short term changes in stream flow and the 139 \nstream responds rapidly to runoff events. A desk study and reconnaissance visits have 140 \ncontributed to the development of a conceptual model of the hydrogeology of the 141 \ncatchment. Four hydrogeological zones that reflect the underlying geology have been 142 \nidentified: [1] upland peat capping the interbedded shales and sandstones with an 143 \ninterbedded limestone (Upper Felltop Limestone) at the lower end of the zone; [2] 144 \ninterbedded shales and sandstones with an interbedded limestone (Lower Felltop 145 \nLimestone); [3] Till capped bedrock, including the Great Limestone, characterised by 146 \nthe presence of dolines (shake holes), which is indicative of karstic void forming 147 \nprocesses, and [4] more resistant Alston Formation bedrock characterized by a 148 \nnumber of waterfalls, for example Turn Well (NY94882 39868). The presence of 149 \nmudstones encourages surface run-off, which may recharge underlying sandstones 150 \nand then re-emerge as springs and the presence of dolines facilitates fast flow to the 151 \nstream, thereby further contributing to the flashiness of the hydrograph. 152 \nPage 7 of 41 \n \n 153 \nAlthough previously worked during a number of phases that are likely to date back to 154 \nat least the Roman period, the majority of the lead mines were exploited during the 155 \nperiod 1692 to 1882 21 (Table 2 22, 23). More recently, driven by the need for high 156 \nquality fluorspar for steel-making, fluorspar has been the principal mineral to be 157 \nexploited in the catchment. Fluorspar mining continued until 1999, when the Grove 158 \nRake Mine (Figure 2, Table 2) closed. Frazer\u2019s Grove Mine comprises four 159 \nunderground mines: Frazer\u2019s Hush, Rake level\/Firestone Incline workings, Grove 160 \nRake and Greencleugh 13. 9, 10, 13 have contributed significantly to the understanding of 161 \nFrazer\u2019s Grove Mine hydrogeology and hydrochemistry. Further descriptive detail of 162 \nthe mine is provided in these references. Sixteen main centres of former mining have 163 \nbeen identified within the catchment (Figure 2, Table 2). The driving of mine drainage 164 \nadits to dewater the mines was common practice in the North Pennines and this had 165 \nthe effect of altering the local hydrogeological regime 24. Of particular note in the 166 \ncontext of the inputs to the Rookhope catchment are the Boltsburn and Tailrace 167 \nLevels.  168 \n 169 \nThe Tailrace Level extends from its portal (NY91624 42779) to Frazer\u2019s Grove Mine 170 \nvia Rispey Shaft (NY91117 42739) and Wolfcleugh Old Pumping Shaft (NY90168 171 \n43230), a distance of approximately 2850 m. It is suspected that not all of the adits 172 \nthat were associated with the Tailrace Level have been recorded and that there are 173 \nlikely to be additional connections between some of the mining areas. This level 174 \ndrains abandoned mine workings with a component of surface run-off entering the 175 \nlevel via crown holes 9. 9, 10, 13 demonstrated that two thirds of the Frazer\u2019s Grove 176 \nwater-make comes from the Great Limestone aquifer with the remaining one third 177 \nPage 8 of 41 \n \nfrom the Firestone Sill and surface inflows. They carried out underground and surface 178 \nsampling of waters from Frazer\u2019s Grove prior to and during groundwater rebound 179 \nfollowing cessation of pumping, and established that the chemistry of the groundwater 180 \nis stratified, reflecting the influence of variations in the bedrock geology (Table 1). 181 \nThree waters were characterised: Type I associated with the Firestone Sill, comprising 182 \nmoderately mineralized Ca-HCO3-SO4 waters with less than 4 mg\/l Zn; Type II 183 \nassociated with the Great Limestone, comprising highly mineralized Ca-SO4 water 184 \nwith up to 40 mg\/l Zn, and Type III associated with the deepest workings, comprising 185 \nmineralized Ca-HCO3-SO4 water with up to 13 mg\/l Zn and an increasing Cl content 186 \nand temperature with depth. The cessation of pumping after closure of Frazer\u2019s Grove 187 \nmine (1998) resulted in the water table rising above the aquifer and discharging mine 188 \nwater with peak Zn concentrations as high as 35.6 mg\/l via the Tailrace Level (Figure 189 \n2), the lowest surface discharge point at 364 m OD.  190 \n 191 \nBoltsburn Level (Table 2) at 332 m OD is not directly connected to Frazer\u2019s Grove 192 \nMine. It was sampled during the monitoring of rebound at Frazer\u2019s Grove Mine 10 and 193 \nwas considered to have a chemistry typical of Great Limestone groundwater, but with 194 \nvariable Fe concentrations (1 \u2013 10 mg\/l). 195 \n 196 \n3. Methodology 197 \n 198 \nSynoptic flow monitoring and sampling for chemical determinations of major ions 199 \nand trace elements was carried out, including both instream sampling points along the 200 \nRookhope Burn and tributary inflow sites (locations of potential contaminant 201 \nPage 9 of 41 \n \ndischarge to the Rookhope Burn). The British Geological Survey database of mine 202 \nadits informed the identification of potential point source contributions. Monitoring 203 \nand sampling were carried out in May 2007, June 2007 and January 2008. The visits 204 \nwere scheduled to coincide with different hydrological conditions and the sampling 205 \npoints were chosen using topographic maps, aerial photographs and field investigation 206 \nin order to cover the stream stretches upstream and downstream of visible mine water 207 \ndischarges, or at the confluence of major tributaries. In practice it was difficult to 208 \npredict the stage of the river owing to the flashiness of the river hydrograph. It was 209 \nconsidered that the May 2007 visit was the closest to baseline conditions, whilst the 210 \nJune 2007 visit coincided with the tail effect of a storm event. Immediately prior to 211 \nthe commencement of monitoring, there was a groundwater outburst from an 212 \nabandoned mine shaft at Wolfcleugh (NY91059 42828; point 7, Figure 2), which had 213 \na marked impact on the chemistry of the Rookhope Burn. 214 \n 215 \nWater pH, temperature, Eh and conductivity were measured in the field using a Water 216 \nQuality Multiparameter meter. Alkalinity was determined by titration immediately 217 \nafter sample collection, using a Hach digital titrator with H2SO4 (0.16 N or 1.6 N) and 218 \nbromocreosol green indicator. Samples for chemical analysis were filtered in the field 219 \nusing a disposable 0.45 \u03bcm cellulose-acetate cartridge filter and collected in 220 \npolyethylene bottles. Chemical analyses were carried out in the laboratories of the 221 \nBritish Geological Survey. Major and trace elements of 1% HNO3 field-preserved, 222 \nfiltered samples were determined by ICP-AES (Varian Vista Axial). Fe (II) was 223 \ndetermined by colorimetric analysis of 2\u20132 dipyridyl spiked samples. The major 224 \nanions Cl, SO4, NO3 and F were determined by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-225 \nPage 10 of 41 \n \n600). Duplicate samples and blanks using cleaned field equipment were included at 226 \neach sampling event for quality control. 227 \n 228 \nDischarge was determined for each sampling point, during each of the sampling 229 \ncampaigns, using the velocity-area method 25.  A Columbia 2 Digital Stream Meter, 230 \nan impeller-type flow meter, was used to measure stream velocity.  In order to achieve 231 \nconsistency, on each occasion monitoring was carried out at pre-determined 232 \nmonitoring positions (marked by posts in the river bank) and at each monitoring point, 233 \nwhere the stage allowed it, the velocity was determined at the same distances across 234 \nthe channel. Discharge was derived from the mean of the values calculated using the 235 \nmid-section and mean-section formulae. Inevitably there are problems associated with 236 \nthis type of monitoring. The variability in discharge is, in part, attributed to the form 237 \nof the river bed, which is occupied by significant volumes of mine and rock waste 238 \nthrough which groundwater flow bypasses the flow monitoring. This is particularly 239 \nevident in places where the watercourse bifurcates around islands of rock and at low 240 \nstages, water can be seen draining from the rock islands to the channel, on one or both 241 \nsides of the island.  242 \n 243 \nContaminant loadings were determined utilizing an approach comparable with that of 244 \n5. At each instream or inflow measuring point the contaminant load was calculated 245 \nfrom the product of the discharge and contaminant concentration. The contaminant 246 \nload distribution along the study stream helped to identify sources and sinks along the 247 \nRookhope Burn, based on an assumption that the load at the end of a stream segment 248 \nincludes the load from the point upstream plus the contribution from all surface and 249 \nPage 11 of 41 \n \nsubsurface inflows along the stream segment. Increases in load between instream 250 \nsites, were attributed to a source associated with the monitored stream segment. If the 251 \ninstream contaminant load decreased between sites, a sink (chemical, biological or 252 \nphysical attenuation of metal load) was assumed to be responsible for the removal of 253 \ncontaminant load, except in locations where this was associated with a reduction in 254 \ndischarge. The cumulative instream load, as defined by 5, was determined at the base 255 \nof the catchment by calculating the sum of the increases in loads entering the stream. 256 \nThis provides a minimum estimate of the total load of contaminant added to the 257 \nstream. The cumulative instream attenuation was, similarly, defined as the sum of all 258 \nthe negative values of change in load.  259 \n 260 \n4. Results 261 \n 262 \n4.1 Discharge 263 \nDischarges of inflow and instream sampling points are reported in Tables 3 and 4. 264 \nFigure 3, which summarises the flow monitoring in the Rookhope Burn stream, 265 \ndemonstrates that there is not a simple linear increase in discharge down the channel. 266 \nTwo stretches of rapid increase in discharge are notable, namely between sample 267 \npoints 9 and 11 (4890 m to 4960 m downstream of the head of the catchment, Figure 268 \n2) and between sample points 19 and 21 (7155 m to 7400 m). The only obvious 269 \ncontributions to these two stretches comprise, respectively, groundwater drainage 270 \nfrom the Tailrace Level (sample point 10) and the surface water contribution from 271 \nBolts Burn (sample point 20), but the volumes derived from adding these 272 \ncontributions to the upstream discharge do not fully account for the increase in 273 \nPage 12 of 41 \n \ndischarge in these stretches. Additionally, the data suggest that there have been losses 274 \nin discharge between monitoring points 21 and 24 (except in June 2007, during the 275 \ntail end of the storm event). 276 \n 277 \nFollowing the first monitoring visit (May 2007) it was suspected that worked mineral 278 \nveins were forming flow paths for previously unrecognised groundwater contributions 279 \nto the Rookhope Burn. To explore further the nature of the contribution in the stretch 280 \nbetween sample points 9 and 11, flow monitoring was carried out in August 2007 at 281 \nclosely spaced intervals across the fault\/ mineral vein associated with the Tailrace 282 \nLevel (point 10, Figure 2, Table 5).  Giving due allowance for the variability that 283 \nresults from the flow monitoring technique described above, the discharge 284 \nmeasurements indicate a groundwater contribution to the stream immediately 285 \ndownstream of the Tailrace Level. Examination of the historic maps, geology map 286 \nand aerial photographs established that this increase is associated with a point that 287 \naligns with a series of mine workings, immediately to the east of the surface 288 \nexpression, of the northeast to southwest-trending mineral vein with which the 289 \nTailrace Level is associated.  Comparable with the discharge from the Tailrace Level, 290 \nthe groundwater contribution was characterised by lower temperature, pH, electrical 291 \nconductivity and total dissolved solids and higher dissolved oxygen concentration on 292 \nthe northern side of the channel (Table 5). Examination of historic records indicated 293 \nthat the increase in discharge downstream of Bolts Burn, between sample points 19-294 \n21, was likely to be mine water from an adit that was driven into Red Vein from the 295 \nsouth bank of the river, immediately downstream of Bolts Burn. Subsequent 296 \ninvestigation in this area identified the presence of a drainage adit at NY93778 42712, 297 \nPage 13 of 41 \n \nwith minimal discharge (0.486 l\/s on 11 May, 2009), which was insufficient to 298 \naccount for the increased discharge between sample points 19 and 21. 299 \n 300 \n4.2 Hydrogeochemistry  301 \n 302 \n4.2.1 Inflows 303 \nTo assist with the interpretation of the contaminant loading in the catchment 304 \nconsideration has been given to the geochemistry of the contributing waters, which 305 \ninclude: minewater; seepages from the mine waste; the Rookhope Burn water quality, 306 \nand contributions from other adits and surface waters (Tables 3 and 4). The 307 \nminewaters were classified as Ca-HCO3-SO4 water, from: the mine water outburst at 308 \nWolfcleugh (sample point 7), Tailrace Level (sample point 10) and Boltsburn Level 309 \n(sample point 18). These waters were found to be near neutral (pH 6 to 7), highly 310 \nionized, with elevated concentrations of: Ca (27-125 mg\/l), Mg (5 to 20 mg\/l), K (6 to 311 \n8 mg\/l at the outburst), HCO3 (73 to 234 mg\/l), SO4 (16 to 299 mg\/l) and F (1 to 5 312 \nmg\/l). Ca:Mg weight ratios in the mine waters were generally high (>6). They were 313 \ncharacterized by Zn concentrations in the range 0.04 to 2.42 mg\/l, the higher 314 \nconcentrations being associated with the mine water outburst (sample 7). Sample 7 315 \nwas also found to be enriched with Mn (3.69 to 6.77 mg\/l). When compared with the 316 \nminewater types defined by 13, they appear to fall within the Type III category, but 317 \nwere generally more dilute. Water from other adits (sample points 26 and 29, Figure 318 \n2) comprised dilute Ca-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3-Cl water with neutral to slightly alkaline 319 \npH values and lower concentrations of Ca, Mg and SO4. The Ca:Mg ratio was found 320 \nto be marginally higher than that of the minewaters (~7.5). These waters were also 321 \nPage 14 of 41 \n \ncharacterised by lower concentrations of F and Zn than the mine waters. Their 322 \nchemistry suggests that the discharge from these adits is largely surface water 323 \ndrainage through the unsaturated zone. 324 \n 325 \nSeepages from the mine waste heaps at Wolf Cleugh (sample point 27) and the 326 \ntributary receiving the drainage from the area of spoil heaps to the west of Rookhope 327 \nBurn at Rookhope village (sample point 28) exhibited different chemistries. Sample 328 \npoint 28 had elevated Zn (0.67 - 0.92 mg\/l), Pb (0.13 - 0.32 mg\/l) and SO4 (138 -329 \n 143 mg\/l) concentrations. The seepage at sample point 27 appears to have been 330 \ndiluted by surface water, exhibiting lower concentrations of these determinands. F 331 \nwas relatively elevated in both samples (1.89 mg\/l in sample point 28, and 1.70 mg\/l 332 \nin sample point 27). Both sample points were dry during the baseflow sampling in 333 \nMay 2007. Surface waters from the tributaries: Brecken Sike, Rispey Sike, Redburn 334 \nand Bolts Burn (sample points: 4, 12, 15 and 20) exhibited lower ionic strength and 335 \ncomprised Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4 waters. The surface waters exhibited lower Ca:Mg 336 \nratios and Zn concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.06 mg\/l. 337 \n 338 \n4.2.2 Rookhope Burn 339 \nWater chemistry of the samples obtained from the synoptic monitoring of the 340 \nRookhope Burn is reported in Table 4. The analyses for the May 2007 sampling 341 \ncampaign are considered to be the closest to the stream base flow conditions and are 342 \nplotted in Figure 4 against distance from the headwaters of Rookhope Burn to its 343 \nconfluence with the River Wear at Eastgate. Sample inflow chemistries are also 344 \nshown. The plots for F, HCO3, SO4, Ca and Mn all exhibit a significant increase in 345 \nPage 15 of 41 \n \nconcentration between sample points 6 and 9, which are attributed to the input from 346 \nthe Wolfcleugh mine water outburst described above. Downstream, the concentration 347 \nof these determinands decreased to the proximity of sample point 11, where it levelled 348 \nout (except for a slight increase in Ca and alkalinity) between sample points 11 and 349 \n13, before a general decrease again in the direction of Eastgate. A second decrease 350 \noccurred downstream of sample point 13 and appears to be coincident with the 351 \noutcrop of the Great Limestone in the bed of the river. Fe concentrations (mainly 352 \nreduced) were higher in the headwaters of the catchment, whereas, upstream 353 \nconcentrations of Zn were in the order of 0.15 - 0.68 mg\/l, but increased steeply in the 354 \nstretch between sample points 6 and 9 respectively, reaching  ~1 mg\/l in sample 9 in 355 \nMay 2007, immediately downstream of the mine outburst at Wolfcleugh. Between 356 \nsample points 9 and 11 the Zn concentration decreased substantially to 0.42 -357 \n 0.21 mg\/l. Between sample points 11 and 13 there was a levelling of the 358 \nconcentration of Zn, before a further progressive decrease downstream to Eastgate 359 \n(0.09-0.11 mg\/l).  360 \n 361 \nThese results indicate that the major changes in the Rookhope Burn stream chemistry 362 \noccurred at, or immediately downstream of, the location of the mine water outburst at 363 \nWolfcleugh. More subtle variations along the catchment point to additional 364 \ncontributions from: mineralized groundwater, seepages from mine waste, surface 365 \nwater and to the influence of changes in the bedrock geology. Along the majority of 366 \nthe length of the Rookhope Burn concentrations of Zn exceeded the EQS (aquatic life-367 \nstandards quoted for salmonid and the more sensitive cyprinid life), calculated on the 368 \nbasis of the hardness of each sample, during the May 2007 sampling campaign. 369 \nExceptions were the headwaters of Rookhope Burn (sample point 1) and the point 370 \nPage 16 of 41 \n \nimmediately downstream of Grove Rake Mine (sample point 3), which did not exceed 371 \neither of the EQS Zn values. However Zn concentrations were above the EQS value 372 \nfor salmonid fish life in the subsequent monitoring campaigns. From sample point 6 373 \n(upstream of the mine outburst) to sample point 19 (downstream of Boltsburn Level) 374 \nall of the water samples in the burn were above the threshold value for cyprinid life 375 \nrelated to the water hardness. The remaining stretch of Rookhope Burn, to its 376 \nconfluence with the River Wear, had Zn concentrations above the EQS value for 377 \nsalmonid fish life. 378 \n 379 \n4.2.3 Zinc Load 380 \nThe hydraulic data, which indicate gaining and losing reaches in the stream, have 381 \nbeen combined with chemical measurements to derive Zn loads in Rookhope Burn in 382 \norder to assess the impact of these reaches on the stream water quality. Figure 5 383 \nillustrates the spatial variation in Zn concentrations and the Zn load along the 384 \nRookhope Burn and Table 6 summarises the gains and losses in Zn load at the 11 385 \nstream segments defined by sample locations in the stream. The Zn load profiles 386 \ndiffer from the concentration profiles in that they display two distinct peaks in load. 387 \nThe greatest increase occurs between sample positions 9 - 11 (upstream and 388 \ndownstream of the Tailrace Level resepectively, ~4890 m and 4960 m downstream of 389 \nthe head of the catchment), in May 2007 and January 2008. In June 2007 the Zn load 390 \ncontribution in the stretch between sample points 6 and 9, located upstream and 391 \ndownstream of the Wolfcleugh mine water outbreak was the largest in the Rookhope 392 \nBurn. The second loading peak entered Rookhope Burn in the stretch between sample 393 \npositions 16-19 and 19-21, respectively, in May - June 2007 and January 2008.  394 \nPage 17 of 41 \n \n 395 \nFor the river stretches characterised by an increase in the metal load, mass balance 396 \ncalculations have been made between the net changes in instream load and the inflow 397 \nloads measured along the same stretches in order to further elucidate the relative 398 \ninfluence of inflows on the stream. The inflow source contributing to stretch 6-9 is the 399 \nWolfcleugh mine water outburst (sample point 7) with a Zn load of 85 mg\/s in May 400 \n2007 (Zn 2.42 mg\/l), 294 mg\/s in June 2007 (Zn 2.34 mg\/l) and 10 mg\/s in Jan 2008 401 \n(Zn 1.45 mg\/l). Water from this inflow point source contributes to 66 to 82 % of the 402 \ntotal Zn load in May and June 2007, but only the 3.5 % in January 2008. For this 403 \nstream segment, the difference between the net change in instream load and the inflow 404 \nload of Wolfcleugh mine water outburst leaves a negative balance of -60 mg\/s in May 405 \nand June 2007 and -20 mg\/s in January 2008. This denotes that the measured inflow 406 \nload entering stretch 6 - 9 is greater than the net change in load measured for the 407 \nstream segment, indicating a possible removal of Zn through physical or chemical 408 \nprocesses. Field evidence of ochre precipitation in the immediate vicinity suggests 409 \nthat Zn mass is lost by chemical precipitation\/ adsorption. Commonly observed Fe 410 \noxy-hydroxide and SO4 mineral precipitation downstream of the river\u2019s confluence 411 \nwith SO4 Fe(II) rich- mine drainage is generally associated with a decrease in 412 \ndissolved concentrations of trace metals, including Zn, due to adsorption on the Fe 413 \nmineral precipitates 26, 27. 414 \nIn contrast, along stretches 9 - 11 and 16 - 19 the gains in Zn load in the stream cannot 415 \nbe attributed only to the sampled inflows. The only inflow in stretch 9 - 11 was 416 \nTailrace level (sample point 10) with a Zn load of: 10 mg\/s in May 2007 (Zn 417 \n0.29 mg\/l); 4 mg\/s in June 2007 (Zn 0.07 mg\/l), and 0.8 mg\/s in January 2008 (Zn 418 \n0.04 mg\/l). The balance indicates an unsampled Zn inflow of: +50 mg\/s in May 419 \nPage 18 of 41 \n \n2007; -0.7 mg\/s in June, and +302 mg\/s in January 2008. Similarly, Boltsburn level 420 \n(sample point 18) alone cannot account for the increased load in stretch 16 - 19 where 421 \na balance of unsampled Zn inflows of: +30 mg\/s in May 2007; +65 mg\/s in June 2007 422 \nand + 8 mg\/s in January 2008 have been determined. The results suggest a significant 423 \ninflow of subsurface Zn-rich water to the stream that contributes to the Zn loading in 424 \nthese areas.  425 \n 426 \nThe greatest apparent net Zn load losses occur along the stretches 13 - 16 and 21 - 23 427 \n(except in June 2007).  Cumulative Zn loads at Eastgate (Table 7), at the downstream 428 \nend of the study catchment, ranged from 130 mg\/s to 360 mg\/s through the 3 sampling 429 \nevents, with instream cumulative attenuation along the study stream ranging between 430 \n80 and 140 mg\/s. The sampled visible inflow loads accounted for 75 to 85 % of the 431 \ncumulative instream Zn load in May and June 2007, but only 6 % in January 2008.  432 \n 433 \n5. Discussion 434 \n 435 \nThe most significant impact on the water quality of the Rookhope Burn that has been 436 \nidentified during the course of this study is the point source contribution of mine 437 \nwater from the outburst at Wolfcleugh. The National Grid Reference (NY391059 438 \n542828) of the location of the outburst indicates that it is situated on Rispey Vein. The 439 \nelevation of the shaft was estimated to be ~375 m OD, which places it marginally 440 \nabove the Tailrace Level ~365 m OD at river level. This suggests that there was a 441 \ncollapse of the underground workings, resulting in a blockage somewhere 442 \ndownstream of Rispey Vein causing an increase in pore water pressures and 443 \nPage 19 of 41 \n \nconsequential outburst of minewater. Remedial measures, which entailed capping the 444 \nshaft and feeding the discharge into an outlet channel, were carried out at some point 445 \nbetween the June 2007 and January 2008 monitoring visits. Coincidental with this, the 446 \ndischarge from the outburst of mine water at Wolfcleugh appears to have reduced 447 \n(35 l\/s in May 2007; 126 l\/s in June 2007 and 6.8 l\/s in January 2008). During the 448 \nmonitoring period the chemistry also appears to have ameliorated (Table 3), with 449 \nreductions in the concentration of SO4, F, Fe, Mn and Zn.  The synoptic monitoring 450 \ncommenced in the order of five months after the outburst occurred. During the period 451 \nprior to the outburst it is likely that the stratification of the water chemistry in Grove 452 \nRake Mine described by 13 and 9, 10 and attributed to the geological influences on the 453 \ngeochemistry was disrupted as a consequence of the build up of pore water pressure, 454 \nsqueezing water into previously unconnected areas of the mine workings. Upon the 455 \nrelease of this pressure, the stratification would have been further disturbed, 456 \nfacilitating the release of more acidic mine water with the acidity being attributed to 457 \nits contact with pyritic shales, as seen in Grove Rake Mine. It is possible that the 458 \napparent improvement in the water quality represents the re-establishment of 459 \nstratification in the mine water.  Further monitoring is required to determine more 460 \nconclusively whether this is the case. The discharge data indicate that the engineering 461 \nworks have confined the flow from the outburst, which appears to have resulted in an 462 \nincreased contribution to the Rookhope Burn via the bed of the stream. 463 \n 464 \nKnown point sources, suspected to contribute Zn loading to the stream via drainage 465 \nadits include the discharge from the Tailrace and Boltsburn levels. Comparison of the 466 \nanalyses determined during this study (0.29 mg\/l and 0.06 mg\/l respectively during 467 \nthe baseflow conditions in May 2007) with those reported by 10 indicate that the 468 \nPage 20 of 41 \n \nchemistry of the water was similar. The Tailrace Level is known to receive a surface 469 \nwater contribution 10. Nevertheless, the significant reduction in Zn and SO4 470 \nconcentrations after the May 2007 sampling suggest improvements in the quality of 471 \nthe groundwater contribution (Table 3), with reductions in electrical conductivity, 472 \nalkalinity, F and Mn also being evident. Furthermore, the postulated blockage 473 \nassociated with the outburst is thought to have affected the discharge from the 474 \nTailrace Level (34 l\/s in May 2007; 61 l\/s in June 2007 and 19 l\/s in January 2008). 475 \nThe improvement in the groundwater chemistry and reduction in discharge appear to 476 \nbe responses to the reduction in head brought about by the release of minewater via 477 \nthe mine outburst and subsequent remedial engineering. The chemistry of the 478 \ndischarge from the Boltsburn Level also showed an improvement during the 479 \nmonitoring period; however the improvement was more variable than, and not as 480 \nprogressive as, that of the discharge from the Tailrace Level, suggesting that the 481 \nvariation represents seasonality of the water quality. 482 \n 483 \nFurther to the known point source contributions, this work has identified two 484 \npreviously unidentified sources of contaminated groundwater, which are suspected to 485 \nemanate from the bed of the river and contribute 15 to 25 % of the cumulative Zn load 486 \nin the Rookhope Burn during the May and June 2007 sampling.  These subsurface 487 \ncontributions, however, become dominant in January 2008 when approximately 95% 488 \nof the Zn load entered the stream through these zones. Analysis of the discharge data 489 \nand Zn loading indicate the presence of one such zone between sampling positions 9 490 \nand 11, where a contribution in the vicinity of the Tailrace Level is suspected.  491 \nA second point occurs between sampling positions 16 and 19. The focus for this input 492 \nhas not been established. Mineral veins cross the stream downstream of the Boltsburn 493 \nPage 21 of 41 \n \nLevel, but closely spaced analysis of the physico-chemical conditions carried out in 494 \nMay 2009 failed to locate the ingress. As the calculation of the Zn load uses the 495 \ndischarge data, any error in the measurement, or calculation of discharge would 496 \nimpact on the calculation of the Zn load. The potential for some loss of flow to the 497 \nbed of the river, where it comprises a significant thickness of boulders cannot be 498 \nentirely precluded. Whilst the accuracy of the discharge cannot be verified, a relative 499 \nincrease in discharge was observed on each occasion. Furthermore, subtle increases in 500 \nthe pH, alkalinity, Ca and Mg between sample points 16 and 19 suggest another 501 \nsource of groundwater. Additionally, the concentration profiles for F and SO4 during 502 \nbase flow sampling (Figure 4) indicate dilution as a consequence of this input.  The 503 \ngeological setting of these points suggests that the increased discharge is attributable 504 \nto the karst hydrogeology in this area. A number of shake holes (dolines) have been 505 \nidentified to the south of the river (centred on NGR NY93338 42874 and NY93489 506 \n42828) in the stretch between sampling locations 16 and 19. The dolines are situated 507 \nin an area where there is a thin cover of glacial till, close to the feather edge of the 508 \nsandstones and mudstones, which cap the Great Limestone. Thus it is likely that 509 \nrecharge via the dolines occurs and indicates the presence of a mature karst system 510 \nthat resurges to the Rookhope Burn via the easterly dipping Great Limestone. The 511 \nlower concentrations of SO4 in this water indicate less contact with the mineralization 512 \nand this is reflected in the lower Zn concentration, when compared with the 513 \nconcentration from the Tailrace Level and from farther upstream.  514 \n 515 \nWhether the contributions in the stretches between sampling locations 9 - 11 and 16 - 516 \n19 should be classified as point or diffuse sources has been the subject of considerable 517 \ndiscussion. Using the approach presented in the introduction these are clearly point 518 \nPage 22 of 41 \n \nsource contributions, however at a closer scale the detail of the point of the emissions 519 \nhas not been fully resolved, particularly in the zone between sampling locations 17 520 \nand 19, where it is suspected that the contribution occurs over a zone in the river bed, 521 \nwhich might be considered a diffuse input. 522 \n 523 \nAnalysis of the Zn loading has also established the existence of Zn sinks. The greatest 524 \napparent net Zn load losses occurred along the stretches 13 - 16 and 21 - 23 (except in 525 \nJune 2007). The reduction in the Zn load between points 13 and 16, downstream of 526 \nthe Tailrace Level, was associated with a significant decrease in the Zn concentration 527 \nin the river (Figure 5), which is likely to be a consequence of attenuation by chemical 528 \nprecipitation of Zn. The reduction in flow suggests that significant dilution is unlikely. 529 \nThe decrease in load determined between points 21 and 23 also coincides with a 530 \nmeasured decrease in discharge (in May 2007 and January 2008). It is difficult to tell 531 \nwhether this reflects flow loss below the bed of the river, or unmeasured flow in the 532 \nstream sediments. It is also possible that there are karstic losses from the bed of the 533 \nriver to the Great Limestone.  534 \n 535 \nSeepage water (sample positions 27 and 28) emanating from waste heaps, 536 \ncharacterised by elevated SO4, Pb, Zn and F, is considered to be representative of 537 \ndiffuse contaminant sources in the catchment.  538 \n 539 \nF has been shown to be a good indicator of mining impacted groundwater in other 540 \ncatchments 28 and the evidence from this work suggests it to be a good indicator in the 541 \nRookhope catchment. From Table 4 it can be seen that elevated F concentrations are 542 \nPage 23 of 41 \n \nassociated with both point (mine water) and diffuse (mine waste-derived) inputs. The 543 \nconcentration of F (0.20 to 4.48 mg\/l) in the Rookhope Burn increases steadily down 544 \nthe catchment, suggesting diffuse contributions, in the mining impacted area, with 545 \nlocal, spiked point source contributions that are locally masked by the minewater 546 \ncontribution from the outburst at Wolfcleugh. The increased loading in a downstream 547 \ndirection indicates the F to be more dispersed and conservative than Zn (Figure 6). 548 \nSO4 shows a similar, dispersed contribution, which is comparable with that observed 549 \nby 5. Locally there is a reduction in the F load associated with a reduction in the 550 \ndischarge determined for sample point 23. This may be indicative of karstic losses of 551 \nstream water to the bed of the river, as hypothesised above.  552 \nThe measured concentrations indicate that F might also be a contaminant of concern. 553 \nWhilst the WHO guideline for drinking water quality is 1.50 mg\/l 29 , 30 suggested that 554 \nF concentrations in the river environment be limited to 0.5 mg\/l, based on the toxic 555 \neffects on invertebrates and fish in soft waters with low ionic content. Toxicity was 556 \nconcluded to be related to water hardness however, and with increased hardness safe 557 \nlevels of F could be increased to 1.0 to 1.5 mg\/l 30. The guideline values are lower 558 \nthan the concentrations determined in the vicinity of the Tailrace Level and during 559 \nbaseflow conditions throughout much of the Rookhope Burn downstream of Grove 560 \nRake. Further research is required to understand the ecological impacts. 561 \n 562 \n6. Conclusions 563 \n 564 \nZn has been identified as the key contaminant of (ecological) concern in the 565 \nRookhope catchment, where it generally exceeds the EQS values for salmonid and 566 \nPage 24 of 41 \n \ncyprinid life. Synoptic sampling and contaminant load calculations have demonstrated 567 \nthat Zn primarily reaches the stream via point sources of mine water. Zn sinks gave 568 \nalso been identified. This may be particularly important in the context of any future 569 \nchanges in the catchment either as a consequence of climate change, or anthropogenic 570 \ninfluences. In considering remedial target measures to achieve \u201cgood status\u201d further 571 \nwork is required to determine the actual ecological impacts of the levels of 572 \ncontamination that have been identified. F has been shown to be a good indicator of 573 \nthe contribution of dispersed contamination to the Rookhope Burn. The measured 574 \nconcentrations indicate that F might also be a contaminant of concern with values > 575 \n1.5 mg\/l during baseflow conditions throughout much of the Rookhope Burn 576 \ndownstream of Grove Rake.  577 \n 578 \nHigh resolution water monitoring, in conjunction with a good conceptual model, can 579 \nbe used to discriminate between point and diffuse sources and subsequently assess the 580 \nimplications of their distribution. In this case study, building on the work of earlier 581 \nauthors 9, 10, 13, this has facilitated the characterisation of the five most significant 582 \nsource contributions of Zn to the Rookhope Burn: the known contributions via 583 \ndrainage adits (Tailrace Level and Boltsburn Level); previously unknown sources of 584 \nmine water entering via the bed of the stream; suspected karst groundwater resurgence 585 \nto the bed of the stream, and the mine water ingress via a recent mine water outburst. 586 \nThe remedial measures for the outburst incorporated a permanent drainage discharge 587 \nto the Rookhope Burn, which will also comprise a long term point source contribution 588 \nof Zn to the stream. Nonetheless, the results of the synoptic sampling and the work of 589 \n10 indicate that the quality of the Burn is likely to ameliorate with time.  590 \n 591 \nPage 25 of 41 \n \nThe triggering of the outburst raises the question of the stability of the underground 592 \nworkings and the risk of designing remediation schemes for a single point, which 593 \ncould be made obsolete in the event of a comparable outburst elsewhere in the 594 \ncatchment. Furthermore, the mine water contribution to the bed of the river highlights 595 \nthe difficulty in designing remedial schemes for mine water contamination, 596 \ndemonstrating the need for more detailed understanding of the hydrology associated 597 \nwith abandoned workings.  598 \n 599 \nThe results from this research highlight the need for an iterative approach to such 600 \nstudies, as the interpretation of the results of the synoptic sampling and analysis has, 601 \nin part, relied upon an untested, conceptual understanding of the hydrogeology of the 602 \ncatchment. For example, the explanation for the increase in the Zn loading between 603 \nsampling points 16 and 19 could be underpinned with dye tracing, via the dolines 604 \nlocated at NGR NY93338 42874 and NY93489 42829, in order to confirm the 605 \nexistence of karst flow paths in the stretch between sample points 16 and 19. 606 \n 607 \n 608 \n 609 \nAcknowledgements 610 \nThe Environment Agency is thanked for assistance with synoptic monitoring reported 611 \nhere, as are Dr Ben Klinck, Dr Simon Chenery and visiting researchers: Arek 612 \nBauerek, Karol Kuras and Natalia Vera de Fernandez.
