In pursuing this, we draw on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in a UK \nbusiness school.  The ethnography involved work with second year management \nundergraduates studying a module in management decision making: \u201cMGT2005\u201d.  \nThis unit is single semester in length and involves students in an extended problem-\nbased learning exercise (PBL).  In this introduction, we briefly locate our work within \nthe broad tradition of critical management studies (CMS).  We then outline the nature \nand delivery of the decision making module and in the process identify value in STS \nin terms of both our teaching method and module content.  Attention then turns to \nconsideration of those aspects of STS that we have selected, and the particular STS \nexamples and voices that we invoke.  In this context, we outline and discuss the \naffordances and sensibilities that our particular versions of STS carry.  Finally, we \nconclude that in combining problem-based learning, STS theory and ethnographic \nfield practices, we have identified an opportunity for STS to become involved in \nmanagement (education). \nCMS represents a diverse and concerted challenge to management orthodoxy by \ndirectly challenging universal reductions of management to concerns for technical \ncompetency and instrumental rationality (Roberts, 1996).  Notwithstanding particular \ntheoretical commitments, CMS critiques of management have established the \nrelevance of social processes for management.  We locate our own work here within \nthe broad tradition of post-structural approaches to CMS.  In this context, for over two \ndecades, there has been considerable academic effort in deconstructing managerial \ntheory and practice.  Inevitably, epistemology is central to this post-structural effort \nwhere management is examined as a constructed category1. \n 2\nDuring the 1990s, whilst CMS is foregrounding epistemology and problematising the \nconstructed nature of management, we also find, in the UK, a significant expansion in \nmanagement education: business enters the academy.  Inevitably, given CMS interest \nin knowledge production processes, management education is identified as a \nsignificant site where management is constructed and reproduced.  Consequently, the \nattendant growth of management consultancy, curricula and pedagogic practices in \nhigher education requires scrutiny (see Parker, 2002;  Grey,  2002).  Indeed, in 1996 \nFrench and Grey edited a seminal collection entitled, Rethinking Management \nEducation, that mapped the terrain of CMS and education.  In this text the \ncontributors argued for changing pedagogic practices in management education.  The \npoint of concern throughout was that management education tended toward a \nrationalist\/training agenda that treated management knowledge as a commodity and \nthe production of such knowledge as unproblematic.  In critiquing this situation, \nFrench and Grey illustrated the need to consider management education as a process \nand sought to challenge the very notion of management effectiveness with its \nnormative commitments to managerialism.  The debate that French and Grey began is \nstill lively, open and current (see Fulop,  2002; Zald,  2002)  and we seek here to \nintroduce STS into the mix. \nFor almost four decades there has been considerable research interest in science.  This \ninterest has been multidisciplinary and has focused attention upon scientific \nknowledge production and science practices .  Each contributing discipline has 2\nprovided seminal insights into science.  Notwithstanding fierce disagreement on \ncertain points of theory\/method, their classic studies have produced a tacit \nunderstanding of science as social practice.  Alongside this interest in science there \nhas been an associated interest in applied science and technology.  Again, the research \neffort here has been multidisciplinary and the theoretical and empirical work \nproductive.  This broad area of interest incorporates both science and technology \nstudies (STS).  To develop our discussion and provide a background to how we work \nwith STS in management education - our ethnography - we now firstly outline \n\u2018where\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 STS is situated in our pedagogy before moving on to pay closer \nattention to our selected versions of STS. \nSTS meets MGT2005 Decision Making: Theory and Practice  \nSTS appears in our management education in two specific ways.  Firstly, STS informs \nthe manner in which we conduct our teaching and learning.  Secondly, we rely solely \non STS for our theoretical and empirical content3.  In order to examine our two \nappropriations of STS, we discuss the particularities of STS in our daily educational \npractice before turning attention to the selection and role of theory.  However, we \nbegin first with some practical background to the module that is at the heart of our \nethnography. \nDecision Making: theory and practice is a single semester module of study on the \nsecond year of an undergraduate award in management.  Typically, the module is \nknown by its unique identifier MGT2005.  Four learning outcomes frame the module \nand each learning outcome reflects an aspect of the CMS imperative to problematise \nmanagerialism in theory and practice4.  MGT2005 is well documented and, in week \none, each student receives a guide that outlines the programme of study, the teaching \nand learning approach, reading lists and assessment. \nComment [CC1]: Please review use of \npresent and past tense. \nComment [CC2]: The purpose of this \nparagraph is not really clear until the end. \nIs there a way of reworking this that \nmakes it fit better into the flow of the \ntext? Also, as a summary statement of \nwhat STS \u2018is\u2019 it seems a bit vague (e.g. \nyou mention multiple disciplines rather \nthan saying what these disciplines are). \nCan this be remedied? \n 3\nThe teaching and learning approach focuses on problem-based learning (PBL).  An \nimperative of PBL is that students inquire into issues and concerns that emerge both \nfrom formal teaching and their activities.  In developing our PBL we construct an \nassignment around a significant problem.  Investigating and addressing this problem \nwill occupy students for the entire semester.  The problem gives a sense of pace and \nurgency to the module and requires that students begin to organise immediately.  In \nthe academic year 2005\/06, the concern was to investigate means to draw students \ndeeper into the academic community of the business school and in the process to raise \nand confront any latent commodification of either their studies or themselves (Grey, \nKnights and Willmott,  1996:103). \nIn addition to the problem statement the assignment identifies four elements of \nassessment: a tender (bidding for a budget of \u00a3500, submitted in week 5); an \nindividual reflective log (submitted week 7); a course \u201cevent\u201d (week 10) and finally, \nan end of module individual viva (undertaken in week 14).  Our assessment regime \nreflects our particular brand of PBL in that it places considerable value on reflection. \nThe assessment for the module has two moments where students are required to fold \ntheory back onto their own practice in order to comment on both theory and practice.  \nAs a practical point, we recommend that students maintain a journal or scrapbook that \ncan act as a record of mundane actions and experiences.  This document may be \nsolely text or may be supplemented with objects, photographs or any other matter that \nstudents think relevant.  For us this record serves as a useful point of discussion in \ntutorials whilst for students, it is a valuable aid when they reflect on and with theory.  \nTutorial and Seminar Support: Connecting STS Ethnographic \nPerformances and MGT2005 \nBoth seminars and informal tutorials play a major role in our STS brand of \nmanagement education.  As we shall show, we are often asking students to handle \ndifficult theoretical concepts and to think with these concepts in particularly difficult \ncircumstances.  Seminars and tutorials become the educational opportunities for us to \nclarify, explain, challenge and affirm student work.  However, the formal spaces and \nplaces in which tutorials and seminars occur are heavily inscribed.  Our offices and \nseminar room do not simply offer a backcloth to the situated performances of \ntutorials.  Rather, the furniture, lighting, shape and size of the room co-produce \ntutorials [refs].  The expected performances are well understood by both student and \nstaff and we have all rehearsed them a great deal.  \nIn tutorial performances we show how STS has value.  We seek to change the \ninscribed relationships that circulate in the clinical rooms we normally inhabit.  To do \nso we refurnish or simply change location and situation.  Indeed, something as simple \nas meeting in coffee bars, internal public spaces or external \u2018comfort\u2019 spots on \ncampus can have a profound effect.  Whilst changing location is essential to our \ndemonstration, we also draw directly on STS fieldwork practice in rethinking \ntutorials.  In particular, we draw experiences of fieldwork into rethink our \nperformances of tutor.  By temporarily turning teaching into fieldwork, we allow \nnotions from fieldwork to enter into our vocabulary and extend our interests to \nfieldwork relationships, rapport and politics of our practice. \nMany seminal STS works have been developed around deep field ethnographies5.  \nThese ethnographies are anthropological in nature and draw researchers into complex \nrelationships over extended periods of time.  Equally, studies that involve and develop \n 4\nanthropological sensibilities are also subject to the methodological concerns that \ncirculate around deep ethnography.  In this context, the well theorised anthropological \nconcerns over rapport and politics of practice become STS concerns as notions of \ncollaboration, complicity and friendship are drawn into examinations of fieldwork \npractice (see Marcus,  1997;  Rabinow,  1997;  Clifford,  1997  and  Strathern  ed,  \n1995).  It is clear that whether working with laboratory scientists, radiologists or hill \nfarmers, STS research often demands attention to relationships between researcher \nand researched.  In these situations our fieldwork collaborators invite us into part of \ntheir lives: we eat, share jokes, make friends, smile and worry as we \u2018study\u2019.  Latour\u2019s \nevocative study of a field trip to the Amazonian Boa Vista connects theory, fieldwork \nand relationships in graphic ways (Latour,  1995) [in what way]. \nIn teaching, we initially focus our tutorial practice on collaboration and in effect we \nact as co-travellers with the students as they problem solve and co-producers of \nwhatever they make MGT2005 to be.  Our role is to bring STS into the spaces and \nplaces of their decision making and engage the students in conversations over, about \nand with STS in decision making.  In thinking through tutorials, we draw on \nexperiences from fieldwork and reflect that, at appropriate moments in fieldwork, we \noften share our translation (transcription) [where does this come from?] of immediate \nevents with the locals and engage in extended conversations or even debates over \ndifferent political cuts and takes that those involved are performing around a \nparticular thing or event6.  This conversational form of interaction is central to \nfieldwork and allows all sides to explain and review the meaning and interpretations \nthat they are producing and co-producing.  At times, fieldwork analysis is a (co) \nproduction of these conversations and experiences.  However, at other times, we draw \na line across these interactions and reassert our own particular responsibilities as \n(sociological) tutor\/analysts.  At such time we fall back on the basic test for \nethnographic accounts \u2013 that is, even if our (friends) (collaborators) conspirators have \nnot been involved in co-producing the point or interpretation, they must at least \nrecognise the description and the account of themselves in our re-telling. \nIn developing our tutorial practices we draw on fieldwork to rethink the quality and \npower relations that are extant in performances of student\/tutor.  We absolutely refuse \nto be positioned as \u2018expert\u2019.  Nor do we play games with students, where there is a set \nof clues that must be followed and performances that must be done.  We are not \nholding back the next clue as they struggle to make sense of the uncertainties they \nmeet in problem solving. Rather, our approach is conversational and complicit.  Our \nonly provision is that, and this is the crucial educational aspect of our appropriation of \nfieldwork practices in teaching, we hold to our responsibilities as representatives of \nSTS in the experiences of students.  At times the STS voice is clear and demanding in \nour conversations, whilst at other moments, it is a far softer and encouraging voice. \nSTS Voices in Management Education: the Case of MGT2005 \nWe have outlined above the basic foundations of the approach that we take in our \nMGT2005 and in the process we have indicated how STS sensibilities and fieldwork \npractices have allowed us to rethink our practice as educators.  In this context, we \nhave drawn attention to the significance of rapport and collaboration in our version of \nSTS informed management education.  We now turn to theory, and the selection and \nrole of STS literature in our programme. \n 5\nIn teaching MGT2005 we focus attention on the material performances that circulate \nin and around problem solving.  Consequently, we draw on theory that addresses \nmaterial performances: that is theory where materials matter (Barad,  2003).  Our \nselected material is drawn from three sources: i) social construction of technological \nsystems (SCOT), ii) actor network theory (ANT) and iii) ontological politics (OP).  \nEach of these sources is rich in content and material, so we focus down again on three \nwell developed examples: bicycles; walls and anaemia.  \nOur selection from the STS literature provides three different ways to investigate and \nsense materiality.  Each approach wields particular terms, theoretical constructs and \narguments.  Before we turn attention to the detail and value of each of our selected \nexamples, it is worth briefly commenting on our selection.  In particular we wish to \nexplain why we opt to use STS studies rather that the increasing body of STS \ninformed organizational studies.  Firstly, whilst there is quite a lot of emerging \nmaterial in organization studies that draws on ANT [such as?] there is little literature \nthat draws directly on SCOT or OP.  Moreover, we have selected literature where \ntheory is laid out with care and where the empirical illustrations are vivid: bicycle, \nwall, anaemia are all knowable even if not overtly managerial. \nWhilst the STS literature that we use reveals theory in careful and artful ways, we \nhave found a hidden bonus in drawing on STS literature: it is unsettling.  We lecture \non bikes, walls, anaemia and related things from weeks two through to week seven \nand this initially throws our students out of a comfort zone. When they first arrive at \nMGT2005, our selection of content seems at odds with their expectations.  The exotic \ncharacter of the material is puzzling and students spend time pondering the relevance \nof the material.  It is this period of puzzling about the material that we find useful \u2013 it \nallows us to draw students into conversation and in these conversations we can draw \non other technologies, their technologies, as a focus of attention. \nOur intention is that over time we can help students to begin to see, feel and \nexperience managerial work through new terms.  It is a combination of experience, \ntheory and reflection that comes together to offer new ways of knowing management.  \nIn this context, we are looking to give students toolsets.  For example, they are able to \ndeconstruct an excel budgetary model in terms of what is present and absent, and to \nrecognise in their deconstructions the work that excel does and the durability that \nexcel carries. \nSo far, so good.  We have outlined the module under consideration and explained how \nSTS both informs our educational practice and identified the three main STS voices \nthat students encounter in MGT2005.  We now turn attention to these STS voices.  \nWe draw on particular empirical examples so as to illustrate how these examples are \nmade meaningful to management decision making. \nPinch\/Bijker and SCOT: Interpretative Flexibility and Closure \nAs we have already suggested, STS has both a history and varied working practices.  \nThe first STS voice that we use in our management education is the combined voices \nof Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker circa the mid 1980s.  In selecting this period and \nPinch\/Bijker, we deliberately connect our management students with a particular \nmoment in the history of STS, the point when a new direction was being mooted in \nthe history and sociology of technology: that is a focus on the Social Construction of \nTechnological Systems (SCOT).  In particular, as insights into knowledge production \nprocesses in science were gathering into a coherent, formal and forceful critique of \n 6\nscientific rationalism, SCOT sought to draw these frames of reference and concerns \ninto a rigorous examination of technological artefacts and the knowledge processes \nthat circulated around them7. \nWhilst many different approaches and concerns can be subsumed under the SCOT \numbrella, in working with management students studying decision making, we have \nselected a specific literature and use it in particular ways.  The literature that we use to \nrepresent SCOT is Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker\u2019s account of social construction of \nbicycles (Pinch and Bijker,  1987) together with the seminal collected work edited by \nBijker, Hughes and Pinch  (1987), Pinch and Trocco\u2019s (2002) ethnography of The \nMoog synthesiser and Oudshoorn and Pinch\u2019s  (2003)  discussion of co-production of \ntechnologies.  Although this is a substantial literature, we use it differentially.  The \nmain thrust of our work on SCOT revolves around Pinch\/Bijker and their \ndeconstruction of bicycles.  Our primary concern is to raise notions of materiality, \ninterpretative flexibility and closure.  Pinch\/Bijker place bicycles at the centre of their \ndeconstruction of done things.  The focus on a mundane technology produces a \ndeconstruction of practice and agency that feels both concrete and empirical.  \nConsequently, this piece is accessible to students as an introduction to materiality. \nIn articulating the social processes of technology, Pinch\/Bijker draw on historical \nsources to illustrate how multiple possibilities, problems and social groups were \nassociated with the emerging technology that is now recognisable as a bicycle.  The \ndiscussion illustrates how \u2018bicycleness\u2019 became stabilised as problems were \nidentified\/lost, solutions deemed plausible\/implausible and social groups deemed \nlegitimate\/illegitimate.  For example, Pinch\/Bijker point to the processes around \nwhich, in the 1890s, the \u2018air tyre\u2019 (now pneumatic tyre) came to be fixed as the \nbicycle tyre.  The closing in place of the air tyre emerged through controversy, with \nprotagonists arguing between the new air tyre and the existing solid version.  At this \npoint it could be argued that whilst different groups were still \u2018designing\u2019 bicycle, \nthere was a degree of openness as to what a bicycle might be and how it may be \nconstructed: there remained some flexibility in the interpretation of bicycle and things \nbike.  Pinch\/Bijker illustrate that engineers involved in designing artefacts were \nconcerned with the level of vibration experienced by cyclists using \u201csmall wheeled \nvehicles\u201d and for some engineers the air tyre was seen as a technical solution to this \nproblem. \nIn deconstructing the air tyre debate, Pinch\/Bijker demonstrate how the social groups \ninvolved around bicycles were experiencing different problems, imagining and \nexperimenting with different solutions and in so doing aligning, competing, and \ncontesting with one another.  In unravelling this example, Pinch\/Bijker illustrate how \nfailure of a particular cherished solution or loss of a particular form of bicycle can be \nunderstood as a social phenomenon rather than a technological one.  Air tyres become \nthe \u2018fixed\u2019 form of bicycle tyre not because they are technically superior solutions to \nthe problem of vibration but because the social forces around them became stronger \nonce speed became the issue (Pinch and Bijker,  1987: 40-46). \nThe value here of introducing SCOT literature into management decision making \ntheory is that SCOT allows us to examine taken-for-granted everyday materials and \nexplore these materials as physical expressions of political intent.  Importantly, in \nSCOT, attention is placed not only on the social milieu in which artefacts are \nconstructed and used but also on the actual content of technology.  By making \nmanagement decision making theory the domain of SCOT, and drawing Pinch\/Bijker \n 7\ninto our studies, the management world can be rendered physical, tactile, material and \nmade.  A space is now available to juxtapose bikes with management technologies \nsuch as excel spreadsheets for budgetary control.  Juxtaposition now becomes a \npowerful tool in management education where the materials of management become \ncandidates for deconstruction and apparently closed mundane management materials \nlose some of their apparent naturalness.  Students, working with new theoretical \nconstructs such as interpretative flexibility and closure, reflect on their own \nexperiences and practices and in so doing, make these constructs relevant to \nmanagement decision making. \nActor Network Theory: Organising Walls and Hybrid Material \nPerformances \nIn turning to actor network theory (ANT), we aim to help students focus on material \nperformances and relationships that are part and parcel of social (managerial) life.  \nANT is a massive field and we must be careful here.  Rather than risk our students \nbeing overpowered by various points of concern that circulate around theorising \nnetwork, we attend to some basics and highlight a study in which some of the pivotal \nconcepts were clearly articulated.  Our selection directs attention to the power of \nmaterials in durable management practice.  Our extending reading list (Latour,  1991;  \nLaw and Mol,  1994;  Bijker and Law eds,  1992;  Law,  1999;  Law and Moser,  \n1999;  Law,  2002) is designed to take students well beyond the points addressed in \nour core text. However, our interest in walls remains the major focus and defines our \nbase-line requirement: that students examine management as relating material \nperformances involving humans and non-humans in combined effort \u2013 net work. \nThe core text we have chosen to stand for ANT is accessible and offers a potent \naccount of mundane technology: that is walls and their partners, doors and hinges  \n(Latour,  1992).  Latour commences his discussion by suggesting that contemporary \nsociological accounts of social life are missing something from their explanations: \nthese are the \u2018social links sturdy enough to tie us all together\u2019  (1992:227).  The \nmissing something that Latour theorises is hard working, \u2018strongly social and highly \nmoral\u2019  (1992:227).  For Latour, the missing something are non-human.  The \nimperative now is to draw non-humans and the work they perform visibly into our \naccounts of order, discipline, morality and control.  To demonstrate his claim, Latour \ndraws attention to what happens when a mundane technology fails, in his case when a \ndoor fails.  He argues that such failures bring forth disorder and the disciplinary \npower delegated to the artefact is revealed. \nIn examining the failure of the door Latour begins to unravel relationships and \nperformances that circulate around doors.  The first step involves examining doors in \ntheir relationships to walls.  Walls become a new point of interest.  Latour describes \nhow, when drawn into social life, walls both order space and discipline users and uses \nof space.  In this context, walls are shown to be powerful actors in social life.  \nHumans and non-human combine in hybrid relationships to organise space, and in the \nprocess define each other. \nLatour examines such human-non-human hybrids in terms of (net) work.  Drawing \nagain on walls, he observes the huge human effort that would be required if managing \nspace was performed as a wholly human enactment.  Once walls are enrolled into \nmanaging then particular orderings of space become stable and durable.  At this point, \nLatour extends the network by noting that if walls are to be effective they require a \nmeans of passage \u2013 otherwise the wall has to be destroyed if we need to cross the \n 8\nspatial boundary: walls need holes.  If human-wall hybrids discipline space, then \nsimply putting a hole in the wall will breach that discipline.  Now, attention must turn \nto the (net) work required to manage human-wall-wall-holes.  If this hybrid is to bring \norder it must manage nature and human interventions.  It is possible that this new \nproblem can be addressed by putting someone to work in order to watch over the hole.  \nHowever, nature can still cross the boundary unimpeded and, as Latour points out \nlater, disciplining human guardians can be a difficult affaire.  Yet, wall-holes cannot \nbe left unmanaged.  If guards are risky, doors are more robust.  Doors can be enrolled \nin the human-wall-hole hybrid to bring order and extend the disciplinary power of the \nhybrid over space. \nThe extension and unravelling of hybrids develop as Latour creates twists and turns \naround different types of hinges and the skilled use of doors.  Latour illustrates how \ndoors and hinges perform order and in the process he describes how power has been \ndelegated to these hybrids as they are drawn into (or enrolled) in organising.  In \npursuing this simple account of wall-door-human hybridity, Latour demonstrates \nsome of the basic tenets of ANT: non-human agency, material hybridity; delegation; \nperformativity; enrolment and translation. \nAs attention moves from bicycles to walls, the students are captivated (and \noccasionally irritated) as they begin to see enrolments and delegations everywhere.  \nAs with SCOT, we use juxtaposition as a conversational device in teaching.  Placing \n\u2018walls\u2019 and \u2018timetables\u2019 side by side allows us to turn attention to material \nperformances of organising in the university.  The effort that would be required to \nmanage their university world becomes visible and its material, durable and relational \ncharacter becomes the point of (seemingly) endless conversations.  We make it clear \nto students that we have only begun to investigate the rich domain of ANT, and only \ntouched on theoretical constructs.  For some students ANT becomes an issue \u2013 a topic \nto pursue into third year and beyond.  For others, walls are enough to unsettle and \ndisrupt their view of mundane managerial technologies.  Irrespective of whether walls \nis a stopping or starting point, we know from reflective logs, viva voce and personal \ncorrespondence that something important has been added to their own decision \nmaking mix. \nOntological Politics: Multiples, Situations and Performances \nWe now turn attention to our third and final STS voice, Mol\u2019s notion of ontological \npolitics: anaemia.  If bicycles offer us a sense of a firm and socially constructed \nreality and walls evoke a sense of material hybrid performances, anaemia introduces a \nphilosophical turn.  Mol\u2019s analysis is organised around the concept of ontological \npolitics that shifts attention away from epistemological to ontological concerns.  For \nMol, reality is not something singular and external to social action. Rather realities \nare multiple and performed in socio-material practices.  The shift from epistemology \nto ontology that Mol introduces is important and our literature is selected with a view \nto clarifying this shift for our management students.  In our teaching, we use Mol\u2019s \npaper on anaemia  (Mol,  1999)  as our core document to set out her contribution to \nthe debates in extending and reopening actor network theory.  Mol draws on \nfieldwork to focus attention on situated performances to demonstrate how reality is \nmade in particular practices and circumstances.  Our discussion now draws on her \ndeliberate account of performances of anaemia. \nMol begins her account of performances of anaemia by examining three medical \nsituations in which anaemia can be found.  The first situation is when anaemia \n 9\nappears in a clinical setting such as when a patient presents themselves at a doctor\u2019s \nsurgery with a problem and anaemia appears in the performances of diagnosis and \ntreatment.  In such a setting, diagnosis may involve a range of question and answers \nand a physical examination appropriate to the conditions.  The second medical \nsituation of anaemia that Mol identifies is the statistical form.  This is a quite different \nsituation and involves very different materials and practices.  The statistical situation \nis laboratory based and the patient is present as a sample of blood and a case with \nparticular attributes.  The focus here is on haemoglobin levels in the blood.  The \npractices involve testing and checking blood samples and relating the results to \npopulation norms.  The final situation is pathophysiological.  In this situation anaemia \nis both biological and individualized.  This performance attempts to identify, for \nindividuals, the level of blood haemoglobin required for effective transportation of \noxygen through their body.  In this performance the body is present as an individual \nenvironment with particular behaviours.  The outcome of the tests here is to find the \nunique level of blood haemoglobin that marks the distinction between normal and \nabnormal in an individual. \nMol notes that in medical texts these three performances are taken as aspects of a \nsingle condition.  Indeed, each performance may be seen as a related expert \nperspective on a single problem - anaemia.  Mol points out that this sense of a unified \nobject viewed from different perspectives is problematic.  Indeed, at times these \nperspectives appear to contradict each other.  For example, some patients will not \npresent symptoms of clinical anaemia but will have a \u2018statistically deviant\u2019 \nhaemoglobin level.  In other words, in one medical situation they are anaemic whilst \nin another situation, they are not.  In furthering the discussion, Mol moves to consider \nhow these different medical situations coexist and how they connect with other \nmedical and non-medical phenomenon.   \nIn pointing to the issue of how sometimes contradictory locations coexist, Mol \nobserves that this is often unproblematic \u2013 that a patient has certain signs and not \nothers is understood and incorporated into the performance of medicine.  However, \nthe issue becomes more significant if we ask how the decision making around the \ndetection of anaemia is conducted.  Historically, in the UK, screening is not \nundertaken for anaemia and the clinical approach, where patients seek help because of \nsymptoms, is deemed satisfactory.  Mol ponders on where and how this decision was \nmade \u2013 concluding that history was probably the most likely answer.  She notes that \nin some cases the state has taken control.  For example, in the UK, water is regulated, \ncontagious diseases are controlled through immunization programmes and in some \ncases, national screening is carried out for breast and cervical cancer in women. \nMol points out that whatever the acknowledged reason for the decision that \u2018detection \nof anaemia is a clinical practice\u2019, fixing that fact in place will have involved a \ndisplacement or translation of the decision.  For example, both screening and clinical \npractices may be translated into NHS budgets, clinical risk factors, technical \nfeasibility and so forth.  Thus for Mol, the crucial determinant of decision making is \nin the way that reality always has to be translated and displaced.  So it is in these \nprocesses that politics is practiced, moral judgments are made and options get \nwhittled down and fixed in place. \nMol develops her account to consider how realities relate and interfere with each \nother.  She demonstrates that realties are never discrete and that they are always open \nto being drawn away or into other practices and other concerns.  It is in this messy \n 10\nconnecting linkage of realities that Mol finds the difficult problem: how decisions are \nmade when potential interferences and options abound.  \nMol\u2019s discussion not only extends the concerns of SCOT and ANT, it also requires \nwe modify our favourite device - juxtaposition.  Our new performance of \njuxtaposition requires far more reflection than the previous show, tell and ask.  Mol \nreveals multiple interfering performances and students tend to unravel this \ncontribution by back-tracking through their own experiences.  For example, in \nMGT2005, the students became fascinated when they found that decision about their \n\u2018event\u2019 moved around a whole host of other university realities.  Finance officers, \nspace managers, and senior managers concerned with intellectual property associated \nwith the use of the university logo, carried their material performances into decision \nmaking about the event.  Eventually, decision making stabilised around matters of \nhealth and safety.  In reflecting on decisions and how they stabilised, students could \nnow explore how different realities of \u2018event\u2019 interfered, happily co-existed and at \ntimes, overwhelmed other realities.  \nPutting STS to Work in Management Education \nThe decision making course is fast paced.  In week one students begin to organise \nthemselves into work groups and work on their assignment task.  In week two, Trevor \nPinch and Wiebe Bijker (virtually) enter the proceedings in the form of a lecture and \ndirected reading.  So, from week two onward, decision making involves the social \nconstruction of bicycles.  It seems unfair to expect students to drop straight into \nSCOT whilst studying decision making, and in those early weeks we seek out students \nand arrange to meet for small informal tutorials in coffee bars around campus.  This \naddition of coffee bar spaces to the prescribed lecture and seminar locations is \nimportant for many reasons.  For example, it provides a relatively relaxed location in \nwhich to build working relationships with students such that they feel adequately \nsupported and able to approach us in a variety of settings.  The early move to the \ncoffee bar is also important in that it can become a valuable point of departure for \nreflection and we can refer back to these meetings when we explore the materiality of \nworkspaces and how different material locations of work lead to different \nperformances.  These reflections serve not only to illustrate materiality but to affect \ntheir (managerial) performances.  Finally, the coffee bar meetings allow us to do the \nmore obvious work of tutorials, namely following up on how students are making \nsense of the course material and identifying any common problems or difficulties  \n(XXXX,  forthcoming). \nStudents respond well to the informal tutorial support that focuses on clarification and \nencouragement.  Our first vignette is taken from one of these meetings and, as we \nhave already suggested, the drama here is in not only what is said or done at this \nmoment but also on how this moment features on student recollections of \u2018key \nmoments\u20198.  We draw on a short extract from fieldwork with our student-decision \nmakers to see how Pinch\/Bijker are going down in week two of MGT2005:9\n (Atrium coffee area.  4.30 ish.  A re-arranged tutorial.  We are seated with \nfour students, a wad of coloured paper and some pens.  Trevor Pinch is the \ncentre of attention \u2013 or at least a diagram from his discussion of bikes] \nJon: Right, now have we got this right then.  Is Pinch is saying that all these \nstakeholders know what a bike is and they argue it out? \nComment [CC3]: the reference to the \nstudent \"event\" needs some elaboration: \nwhat is this? It is only mentioned \npreviously (p3 para 2) as part a list of \nstudent activities. \n 11\n{LH interested in the translation from interpretative flexibility and closure to \nstakeholders - goes for a gentle redirect} \nLH: Ok Jon, let\u2019s have a look shall we.  Really pleased you have read the \ntext \u2013 and really really pleased you brought it with you\u2026 now \n(looking round the group) before we have a look at the bikes can \nyou remember Trevor Pinch talking about interpretative flexibility \n(some nods some shaking of heads) \u2013 Ok, can we just have a look \nat that and see where it takes us \u2013 it\u2019s important...anyone got a \ntake on\u2026 \nLucy: (hesitantly)\u2026well I read that bit and  I think I got it, is it when, well, this \nsounds daft but like before a bike has become a bike and lots of \ndifferent opinions are floating around but a bike could still be like \nlots of\u2026 \nJon: yeah, one wheel, three wheels, small wheels, big and little wheels \u2013 yeah \nthey hadn\u2019t got it right yet and \nLH: (moving forward quietly interrupts) ok, I\u2019m just going to stop you at \nthat point guys,, you are definitely on your way but we need to go \na bit slower and take a closer look.  Now Jon, you just said they \nhadn\u2019t got it right yet\u2026 how does \u2018right\u2019 get made according to \nPinch \nLucy: (emphatically) socially. \nLH: (smiling) good \u2013 but what does that actually mean, look here \n(pointing to a diagram in the directed reading) \u2013 talk me through \nit \u2026  \n (Jon and Lucy hesitantly take turns walking through the diagram.  The tutorial \ncontinues with questions on both side.  Tutors offering affirmation whilst \nblocking false trails and over quick simplifications of the notions.  The students \nbegin to dig down into the ideas and realise there are some big notions tucked \naway in this discussion of bikes) \nWM: so, can we lose the words stakeholder and focus on Pinch\u2019s concepts \n\u201cinterpretative flexibility\u201d and \u201cclosure\u201d \u2013 now, these are the two \nkey concepts to get hold of and work out what exactly Pinch \nmeans.  You ok on that? \nJon and Lucy: yeah \u2013 we\u2019ve got a group meeting tonight \u2013 can we email you? \nLH: yeah \u2013 but focus on getting at what Pinch means with those particular \nwords\u2026 they are really important and we\u2019ll regroup on this in the \nlecture \nIn the above extract we are beginning, very gently, to surface and question some of \nthe notions that the students are bringing to their studies.  As we have already \nindicated, we have selected this extract because it features powerfully in both \nstudents\u2019 reflective logs and in the end of module viva.  In explaining here why this \nwas an important moment requires that we firstly focus on the specific encounter \nbefore moving offstage and pursue \u2018what happened next\u2019.   \nIn the above vignette, a tug-of-war is being played out between a reading that reduces \nand translates the Pinch\/Bijker analysis of interpretative flexibility and closure \ninvolving relevant social groups into a more general discussion of stakeholders.  \nInitially, we respond by gently pulling Jon back from his cherished word \n(stakeholder) and focusing attention on a more careful reading of the text.  Even so, \nComment [CC4]: Can you comment \non the use of the notion of \"false\" trails \nhere \u2013 does this presume the existence of \nsome \u201ccorrect\u201d trails towards STS \nenlightened management education? (!) \n 12\nstakeholders keep popping up as students explain the diagrams to one another and \ninvestigate the argument.  A hidden drama emerges as we continue to insist on close \nattention to theoretical vocabulary.  Students have to work out why Pinch\/Bijker \nprefer the cumbersome phrase invoking \u2018deep understanding\u2019 of \u201crelevant social \ngroups\u201d over the more familiar term stakeholder.  It can come as a shock to students \nwhen they realise that it is they who are concerned with stakeholders, not \nPinch\/Bijker.  As we unravel this sociological moment, the students are often unaware \nof how or why they have selected this term.  Over the next few days\/weeks of inquiry \nwe return to this moment and ask why.  Why did stakeholders appear?  How is \n\u2018stakeholders\u2019 done?  and, why is stakeholder inadequate for Pinch\/Bijker?  Terms are \npoliticised and decisions over terms are politicised.  The unrecognised politics that \nJon performed as he translated Pinch\/Bijker into familiar terms is fore-grounded. \nIn pursuing questions about stakeholders, we can extend the political point and \ninvestigate whether these terms carry different affordances, opportunities and \nconsequences for organising.  So, now let us return to the vignette and continue with \nthe moments that follow from the exchange in the atrium (at least in student memory).  \nThis is when the static vignette takes on a life of its own in inquiry-based learning.  At \nthis point, students explore notions of stakeholder and find richer accounts than that \noriginally offered by Jon.  So, casualness is being challenged.  In parallel, we follow \ntheir investigations and draw their attention to a particular study from the modules \n\u2018reading list\u2019: that is an STS account by Law and Callon,  (1992)  involving an \nempirical discussion of the death of TSR2 (a military aircraft). \nWe select this example from STS because this particular case offers a further way of \nthinking and doing stakes: through the metaphor of neighbours.  In the context of Jon \nand his colleagues, the TSR2 case can be juxtaposed with their concerns over \nstakeholders and so allow access to a more dynamic description of relationships \nbetween others in organising.  Neighbourliness is both a familiar and rich way to \nimagine organising relationships and, as WM points out, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t sustain a \npopular TV soap about stakeholders\u201d.  We are now able to focus on the relationship \nbetween concepts, performances and locations of contrasting forms of organising.  \nDeveloping students to think with notions such as interpretive flexibility offers \nopportunities, indeed gives permission, for opening up closed and rehearsed \nperformances.  At the very least we are trying to demonstrate that:  \n\u201cthe actions and solutions proposed by actors (were) shaped by the way in which \nthey articulated problems while: \u201caction\" and \"practices\" simultaneously \nstructured the social process of problem definition\u201d  (de la Bruh\u00e8ize,  1992:140).   \nThe use of STS empirical work here is highly relevant.  The literature is, to a certain \nextent, exotic.  It is not overtly meaningful to the concerns of management and \nstudents are both frustrated and intrigued by the choice.  Importantly, this is not a case \nof continuously presenting students with more complicated material from a subject \narea outside their experience, rather it involves a commitment to working with \nstudents in order to build connections between \u2018interesting things about organising \nfrom here\u2019 and \u2018interesting things about organising from there\u2019.  Overall, we want \nstudents to be sensitised to knowledge production processes of management and to \nconfidently pose questions about the tools and techniques of management and \nimaginaries that are wielded in daily organising. \nLet us now turn attention to one of the major contributions that STS theory offers \nmanagement education: namely the material character of management action.  In \n 13\norder to make our point here we move the action on a further week, and this time we \nmove to a seminar room where the students are focusing their effort on the assignment \nproblem.  Now, the students are caught up in doing management and in the process \nthey bring assumptions, techniques and tools \u2013 charts, models and characterisations to \nthe table and we find some key concepts in the original document sidelined and new \nimperatives emerge:  \n(Scene - Seminar Two.  Week Three.  Students have been busy \u2013 beavering \naway forming groups and reading assignments.  Seminars are getting rather \nother worldly.  The assignment has somehow become a brief in student talk.  \nStudents have picked up on one word in the introduction and turned it into a \nkey concept.  But, \u2018the brief\u2019 is gathering power as they talk) \n\u2026 \nMichael: \u2026 in the brief it says that we have to form (pause a beat) syndicates.. \ner .. can we work across seminars? \nWM: I guess so\u2026 I have no objection in principle, but you\u2019ll have to \nmake it work \u2018cos of the timetables \n\u2026 \nHuw so, in the brief it says we are supposed to do a team building thing \nwith the rest of the students \u2013 is that right? \nWM: er \u2013 team building?  Where did you get that from?\u2026 \nHuw here, it says make everyone feel included  \nWM: what do the rest of you make of that? \nAlice: From the Brief is seems clear to me that we are supposed to make \neverybody know which Faculty they are in. \nHuw: .. it says department here\u2026 \nAlice\u2026 what\u2019s the difference, (frustrated) \u2013 oh I don\u2019t get it \n( debate continues with WM out of their loop \u2013 for some reason students \nexclude him from this bit of clarification\u2026 WM waits to be asked back in.  \nEnergetic work follows with diverse lines of thought to be pursued.  Finally, \nafter ten minutes or so) \nClaire: (adopting summarising voice) Ok.  So, we can be in groups across \nseminars, The Brief wants us to get together and do something \u2013 so \nthat we all get to know each other better\u2026 \n(general agreement, some nodding, all seem to be thanking various  gods \nsomebody has got \u2018it\u2019 \u2013 everyone was getting twitchy with the going round in \ncircles but did not know how to do STOP.  Claire performs the stop) \nClaire \u2026so, I think it would be a good idea if we all exchanged mobile numbers \nand email addresses\u2026 so\u2019es we keep in touch \n(relief all round\u2026 confusion disappears as they fix on doing this activity and \npieces of paper, whiteboards and phones all enrolled.) \n(The exchange of \u2018information\u2019 done, a timekeeper type begins to pack away.  \nStudents and lecturer move toward the door \u2013 small talk continues.   As WM \nhangs back he overhears an exchange outside) \n 14\nAlice: (quietly to friend)\u2026  It\u2019s rubbish, I wouldn\u2019t be doing it like this \u2013 they \naren\u2019t telling us anything, how can we learn anything like this, its daft \n(\u2026 continues out of range) \nWe have two observations to make at this point.  Firstly, our students are involved in \nactivities of selecting, associating, translating, defining, fixing and naming things.  \nAnd, secondly, materials matter. \nIn using the above vignette to explain our interest in matters of translation, fixing and \nnaming, we draw particular attention to the \u2018brief\u2019.  Interestingly, in the original \nassignment the notion of a brief is cursory and appears only as a throw away sentence \nof four words, \u201cThe brief is open.\u201d  However, as we listen to student talk in week \nthree, and follow their activities, the word brief carries significant meaning \u2013 and is \ntaking a central anchor point in their organising and sense making.  Somewhere in \nmeetings, emails and discussions, the brief is being translated from lower to upper \ncase.  We ponder on this situation with the students.  Everyone wonders quite how \nthis naming of things happened \u2013 no one it seems is quite sure. \nAt this point, not only has the brief\u2019 gained ground and authority in student \nconceptualisations of the problem, some of our original assignment concepts have \nbeen absented.  For example, \u2018alienation\u201910 and \u2018cohesion\u201911 appear in the original \nassignment but they rapidly gave way to talk of inclusion and team building. Things \nare getting real and it is time for a short debrief. \nIn doing this debrief, our intention is to work with the students and explore how, in \nmanaging the uncertainties that are presented, we have all actively engaged in \npolitical talk and practices.  In this context, we collectively examine how, in \nexplaining their activities and ideas, students repeatedly appeal to other experiences, \nand other locations.  For example, students draw on their previous educational \nexperiences and connect the current task with work they have done when participating \nin Young Enterprise competitions.  Other students connect the task with current work \nexperiences \u2013 noting how their employers have similar problems and that they have \nbrought in consultancies to work against a Brief.  On the other hand, students taking \njoint honours with Marketing will simply argue that the assignment is a brief \u2013 as \nmany of their assignments are indeed defined this way. \nIn week three we begin to reflect on processes of definition and fixing by focussing \non both what knowledge is being brought into the mix and how it is used.  Now, our \nSTS readings are valuable.  Pinch and Bijker have already opened up interpretative \nflexibility and demonstrated that social groups are not necessarily neatly bounded and \nproblems are not always shared.  In adding to the STS accounts we now have an ANT \nliterature to draw on, and Latour directly enters into the proceedings.  Now, we can \nturn attention to situations, performances and materials.  Notions of material \nassociation and delegation are made meaningful to the naming and fixing that we \nhave all observed.  The making of The Brief, has direct parallels with the making of a \nproject demonstrated by Latour in his study Aramis  (1996). \nOnce ANT has entered into management education, we are able to focus student \nattention on the role of materials in the process of fixing, naming and doing.  To \nillustrate this point, we return again to the vignette above, and focus on how Claire \n\u2018manages\u2019.  It is Claire who appears the strongest actor in controlling frustration and \nbringing order to uncertainty.  Claire\u2019s organising is notably material as she sets about \norganising time, communications and people.  Mobile phones and email accounts are \n 15\nturned into resources for the project and as a result, she expects everyone to make \ntheir personal contact details available to others in the group: and they do.  In \npursuing the moment, the whiteboard becomes a place where ideas are captured and \nthe technologies for teaching and learning become Claire\u2019s resource for \u201cgetting \nthings done\u201d and \u201cmoving on\u201d.  At this moment, the others act differently: writing \npaper emerges, whiteboard notes are copied down and a sense of order gradually \nemerges.  The moment may appear mundane but, it is a moment that we return to \nregularly with the students in debriefing.  The students felt the drama here and \nconnected strongly with the relationship between their feelings, expectations and \nbehaviours.  Materials were demonstrably important in turning their frustration into \norder.  It is in this way that the students came to know that materials matter.   \nJust as with our earlier example, it is worth considering now what happens once \nClaire has everyone busy doing \u2018stuff\u2019.  In practical terms a great deal begins to \nhappen.  Within a week of emails being exchanged we find all manner of materials \ncirculating.  Indeed, it seems a short step from exchange of email addresses to the \nformation of project plans and organisational master plans.  Very quickly, the \nfunctional structures that students hang their hopes on get named and nominally \nresourced.  Well understood models, functions and processes become elevated and \ndesign, production, marketing and so forth are invoked as unproblematic elements of \na system that can deliver the goods.  Alongside this we see various management \ndiagnostic instruments being found and aired.  We were particularly interested to find \nstudents enrolling psychological and cognitive profiling as they tried to fit individuals \nto roles in successful team building12.  We had no way of knowing that students would \ntake this particular approach to resourcing and dividing up labour but once they did, it \nwas certainly worth reflection. \nSo, within two weeks of Claire \u2018moving things on\u2019 a great deal of work has been \nundertaken.  In the lectures and seminars things are moving on too.  Mol enters the \nfray and OP becomes a resource for thought and action.  In the debriefing session, \nattention turns to how resourcing the project became a question of assessing \nindividual cognitive and psychological style rather than, for example, a question of a \ncooperation, participation, community, mutuality, ownership or even curiosity.  In \nexamining the vexed nature of such optionality, we juxtapose this way of resourcing \nwith Mol\u2019s discussion of the multiple realities of anaemia.  We connect students \norganising practices with Mol\u2019s discussion of how detection of anaemia became fixed \nin place as a \u2018clinical\u2019 practice.  The discussion revolves around Mol\u2019s claim that \nwhatever the acknowledged reason for this \u2018fact\u2019 of the matter, in fixing it (that fact) \nin place, there is displacement of the decision as it shifts from one site to another \n(Mol,  1999: 80).  Our point here is to examine options for organising and re-imagine \nwhat it might mean if these options were put into practice as part of the \u2018solution\u2019 \u2013 \nwhat different experiences of work, different problems and different possibilities \nmight be surfaced if performances shifted (even slightly) and other networks were \nenrolled. \nConclusion \nThis article has contributed to concerns over how STS can mean business by \ndemonstrating the role of STS in management education.  The intention is to extend \nthe critical management education agenda and point to new possibilities that STS \naffords.  The aim was to demonstrate the value of bringing STS theory, method and \nempirical works directly into management education.  We have shown that combining \n 16\nSTS sensibilities and practice with problem-based learning offers a space in which \nscience and technology become valuable points of conversation, reflection and \ndeparture.  We claim that STS and management education share a common concern \nfor organising.  We suggest that the juxtaposition of apparently unconnected materials \nand performances has value in that it affords opportunities to foreground obscured \norganising aspects of managerial practice.  In our paper we show that contributions \nfrom social construction of technological systems (SCOT), actor network theory \n(ANT) and ontological politics (OP) bring specific affordances to the study of \norganising.  The introduction of SCOT allowed us to examine mundane materials and \nexplore these materials as physical expressions of political interests.  Extending our \nconcerns to ANT allowed students the opportunity to investigate management as \nmaterial, durable and relational.  The third STS contributor, ontological politics, \ndemanded that attention was paid to ontological concerns.  Combining these three \nSTS voices elevated materiality, durability and multiplicity in management decision \nmaking practices.  We show that our introduction of STS to management education \nproduced uncertainty and unsettled extant relationships.  We illustrate how \nethnographic fieldwork sensibilities interrupted this destabilising tendency and \nenabled us to reframe educational relationships and outcomes in ethnographic terms: \ncollaboration, complicity and rapport.  Both students and tutors found value in \nuncertainty.  The implications of integrating STS into management education were \ndemonstrated in the ethnographic account and discussed in terms of both the content \nand delivery of management education.  We concluded that a combination of STS \ntheory, ethnographic conversational style and problem-based learning allowed \nstudents to re-imagine management and, in so doing, raise new possibilities for \nexamining experiences of work, management problems and organising possibilities.  \nIn sharing our experiences of connecting STS to management education, we point to a \npossible way that STS can mean business. \nNotes \nWe are deeply indebted to all our students who have helped us to pursue our longstanding \ninterest in management.  In particular we would like to pay special thanks to students who \nmade Avrenim during MGT2005 in the academic year 2005\/06. \n1 Post-structuralist analyses of management are wide ranging and draw attention to the \nconstruction of management by reference to particular performances or absences.  \nConcerns include aesthetics, emotionality, embodied practice, artefacts and space.  \n(e.g. see  Grey and Willmott, 2005;  Linstead, Fulop and Lilley , 2004;  Linstead, \n2004b;  Strati, 1999;  Hassard and Parker, 1993;  Hassard, 1993;  Alvesson and \nWillmott, 1992) \n2 For classic studies of science (e.g. see sociologists Latour and Woolgar, 1979;  \nCollins,  1985.  Historians  Shapin and Schaffer, 1989; Shapin, 1996.  Anthropologists  \nDowney and Dumit, 1997.  Feminists  Harding, 1986;  Haraway, 1991.  \nEthnomethodologist Lynch 1985, 1993.) \n3 It is important to point out here that whilst STS is the only formal theory that we draw \ninto MGT2005 our students are entitled to extend this content should the need they \ndeem it necessary.  Extensions are welcome but any such development must be \nexplained and justified before we will follow where the students lead.  The focus is \nalways on theoretical extension and comparison not replacement.  \n4 For the academic year in question the outcomes for MGT2005 were \u201cthat on \nsuccessful completion of the unit the student will be able to: critically examine the \nnotion of rational decision making; understand the role of interpretation, boundary and \ntransformation in decision making; consider decision making as a material \nComment [CC5]: Maybe better to \nspeak of theoretical resources (plural) \nrather than a \u201cformal theory\u201d here? \n 17\nperformance; discuss the role of power in decision making processes.\u201d  \n5 There are some notable examples where deep ethnographic fieldwork has informed \nSTS theorising.  (e.g. see  Latour and Woolgar, 1979;  Latour, 1987;  Pinch and \nTrocco,  2002;  Mol, 2002;  Fortun, 2001;  Rabinow, 1996, 1997;  and Wynne, 1996.) \n6 We draw on Clifford (1990) where he observes different moments in fieldwork: \ntranscription is one moment.  Our point here is that in collaborative ethnographies \nsuch moments often move to become opportunities for conversations with our field \n\u2018subjects\u2019 (for want of a better word).  In such conversing and debating the so-called \nsubjects are drawn into our world and come to be concerned over our crafting of \ntheory\/analysis and interpretation. \n7 It is worth noting here that the social construction here was not appealing to or \ndebating with notions of social construction derived from either Foucault or Berger \nand Luckmann.  Instead, the emerging explanations of social construction of SCOT \nwere drawing primarily on literature in history and philosophy of science and in most \ncases had its own integrity and consequently its own foci \u2013 (see e.g. sources cited by \nLatour and Woolgar 1979; Bloor 1991;  Bijker, Hughes and Pinch (eds.) 1988) \n8 We have selected moments that students referred to repeatedly as they reflected upon \ntheir coursework.  These were the moments when, for many, the penny dropped or an \nidea was laid down. \n9 We follow Dugdale  (1999)  in that for the purposes of confidentiality and to keep \nfaith with our students we chose to represent fieldwork as fictional dialogues.  \nHowever, in scripting these conversations we draw heavily on our field-work, field-\nnotes and field-artefacts collected during 2005-06.  These are not accurate verbatim \nreports, rather for the purpose of clarity we offer composite scenes that evoke the \nfieldwork and stay as close as is appropriate to the language and flow of the various \nmeetings.  In this context, characters have been drawn that cannot be mapped to any \nindividual.  In all cases, the characterizations here are selective, partial and cannot be \ntaken as a whole and faithful representation of any individual \n10 Refers to line 4 of the introduction to the assignment: \u201c\u2026 students \u2026 being alienated \nfrom the department\u201d \n11 Refers to line 9 of the introduction to the assignment: \u201c\u2026needs for \u2018inclusiveness\u2019 and \n\u2018cohesion\u2019.\u201d \n12 There are a range of management instruments that are designed and regularly deployed \nin profiling individuals for team roles.  Interestingly, both Belbin\u2019s study of team roles \nand Myers\u2013Brigg personality types have been regularly drawn into student organising \nReferences \nAlvesson, M. & Willmott H.,  eds  (1992)  Critical Management Studies.
