When these fractions have been determined \nin the laboratory by sieving, sedimentation or laser methods, they are referred to as the \nparticle size distribution (psd) of the soil. Published studies (Hunt et al., 2006; Lewis et \nal. 2003; http:\/\/www.cdms.net\/ldat\/ld6NS001.pdf) and DEFRA\u2019s RB209 \u2018Fertiliser \nRecommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops\u2019 (MAFF, 2000) indicate that \npsd should be taken into account in determining rates of fertilizer and pesticide \napplication to the soil.  Inaccurate determination of soil psd where soil has developed on \nchalk in England has clear implications for decisions in agricultural management, \nparticularly in relation to the leaching of nitrate. In England chalk is the parent material \nfor soil over 8825 km2, about 7 % of the soilscape (Figure 1). Nitrate sensitive areas \n(NSAs) and nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) have been established in England to try to \nreduce the amount of nitrate that enters the surface and ground water supplies. The \ndesignation of these areas and zones has put pressure on farmers to use nitrate fertilizers \nmore diligently (DEFRA, 2002).  \n \nFigure 1 near here \n \n The sand-sized fraction of soil (63\u20132000 \u00b5m, Soil Survey of England Wales, \nHodgson, 1974) is predominantly chemically inert quartz that has a low water-holding \ncapacity. The clay-sized fraction (<2 \u00b5m) typically comprises mainly phyllosilicate clay \nminerals that readily absorb and adsorb water. Although it has been recommended that \n 4 \ncalcareous-rich soil should be decalcified before particle-size analysis (Francis and \nAguilar, 1995), it is our contention that key soil properties, such as the water holding \ncapacity and its implications for the loss of applied fertiliser, cannot be understood if the \ncarbonate-fraction is removed. \nThe psd for precision farming is usually determined by laser diffraction methods \nfrom numerous soil samples taken within one field because sedimentation methods are \nmore costly. Sampling and laboratory analysis account for the main cost of producing \naccurate soil maps. Identifying differences in soil textural class by hand texturing could \nreduce the cost of mapping soil texture, but this is not sufficiently refined to show how \nthe sand silt and clay sized fractions vary across a field. The precision farming approach \nhas been encouraged in NSAs and NVZs because it should lead to more efficient \napplication of agro-chemicals and result in less pollution of ground and surface waters. \nCarbonate rich soil is particularly prone to the rapid transmission of agro-chemicals \nthrough the profile. Therefore, given the widespread use of laser-based methods to \ndetermine psd for precision farming, the reliability of the laser approach requires further \ninvestigation in the context of such soil. \nLaser and sedimentation techniques define the size of a particle differently, and \ntherefore measure different properties of the same material (Konert and Vandenberghe, \n1997). To account for the predominance of non-spherical phyllosilicate clay minerals, \nlaser methods generally require a different boundary between the clay and silt-sized \nfractions to be equivalent to sedimentation to deal with the predominance of non-\nspherical, phyllosilicate clay minerals. Konert and Vanenberghe (1997) suggested that the \nupper limit for the clay fraction determined by laser should be 8 \u00b5m for its percentage to \n 5 \nbe equivalent to that measured by sedimentation with a 2 \u00b5m limit for a range of psds. \nThis paper has been cited extensively (136 times) since it was published and this \u2018fudge \nfactor\u2019 has been widely used to express psd determined by laser. It is applied routinely by \nseveral agencies when they analyze soil psd commercially, and sometimes without \ninforming the client. This is clearly as misleading for land management as assuming that \nthe laser and sedimentation methods will give the same results. It is important that \npractitioners understand the different methods for psd and the assumptions upon which \nthey are based. \nWe investigate whether the standard application of sedimentation and laser \nmethods with this \u2018fudge factor\u2019 is appropriate to determine the soil\u2019s psd when the \nparent material is calcite-rich Cretaceous Chalk. This rock is widespread in southern and \neastern England, and northern France. Our aim here is to show that the discrepancies in \npsd measurements by sedimentation and laser diffraction methods are different for soil \ndeveloped on chalk compared with that developed on other parent materials. Differences \nin the mineralogy of the size-fractions affects what we assume to be their typical \nbehaviour in terms of water and nutrient retention, and this has important implications for \nfertilizer and pesticide recommendations which need to be understood better. The \nexisting methods of sedimentation and laser diffraction might need to be amended for \nchalk soil to ensure that fertilizer and pesticide rates are appropriate in NSAs and NVZs.  \n \n \n \n \n 6 \nDetermination of particle size distribution (psd) \nSedimentation methods \nThe air-dry < 2mm soil fraction is usually pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide to destroy \norganic matter and reduce aggregation of the soil particles to determine the soil\u2019s psd. \nThe soil is then dispersed using sodium hexametaphosphate, ultra sonic dispersal, or \ndecalcification (NEN 5753, 1990). Differences in sample pre-treatment can affect the \nresults of particle size analysis, particularly for chalk soil. For example, Hartwig and \nLoeppert (1991) showed that shaking and sonic dispersal before particle size analysis \nincreased the proportion of clay-sized carbonates and decreased the proportions of sand- \nand silt- sized carbonates. They recommended an initial treatment with Na to disperse \nsoil aggregates to avoid grinding carbonate particles when determining the psd for \ncarbonate rich soil.  \nThe pipette method (Avery and Bascomb, 1982) has become a standard method of \ndetermining psd. However, it is time-consuming as it is based on the settling velocities of \ndifferent sized spherical particles derived from Stokes\u2019s Law for streamlined flow \n(Rowell, 1994): \n    v = 2gr2(\u03c1s \u2013 \u03c1l) \/ 9\u03b7 ,     (1) \n \nwhere v is the sedimentation velocity (m s-1), r the particle radius (m), g the gravitational \nforce per unit mass (9.81 N kg-1), \u03c1s the density of the particle (2600 kg m-3 is the average \ndensity for soil particles), \u03c1l is the density of the liquid (998 kg m-3 at 20\u02daC for water) and \n\u03b7 the viscosity of the liquid (1.002 x 10-3 N s m-2 at 20\u02daC for water). \n 7 \n Sedimentation analysis relies on two assumptions (i) that particles are solid, \nsmooth spheres, and (ii) their density is the same and equivalent to the average value of \nparticle density (see above). Violation of the two assumptions associated with \nsedimentation methods (Konert and Vandenberghe, 1997) has important implications for \nthe reliability and comparability of the results of sedimentation. Phyllosilicate clay \nminerals tend to have a platy shape and so settle slowly in liquid compared with other \nminerals with the same average diameter. Consequently, the clay-sized fraction can be \nover-estimated by sedimentation. The particle density also varies with mineralogy and \nthis often varies with size fraction of the soil. \n \nLaser Methods \nDetermination of psd by a laser granulometer cell depends on different degrees of \ndiffraction of a laser beam by particles, which registers at photoreceptors for different \nsized particles. The intensity of light at each detector is measured and the psd is \ndetermined from a model, usually the Fraunhofer. Laser methods determine the size of \nthe particles based on their diameter at the angle at which they intercept the laser beam. \nLaser granulometers have been shown to be consistent in results reported based on the \nanalysis of standards materials (Konert and Vandenberghe, 1997). Nevertheless, there are \nthree main assumptions that underpin laser methods for psd are: (1) transformation of the \nlaser diffraction patterns into particle sizes assumes that the particles are spherical; (2) \norientation of the particles is assumed to be random and (3) the theoretical basis for the \nchosen inversion procedure (Mie-theory or Fraunhofer model) is assumed to be correct \nand appropriate for the particles being investigated.  \n 8 \n All of these assumptions might not be met for a given soil sample. The recorded \ndiameter for non-spherical, platy, phyllosilicate clay minerals will vary markedly \ndepending on the angle at which they intercept the laser beam. Also laser diffraction \nmeasurements often take place in continuous flow and so particles can become oriented \naccording to shape, although this is not the case for the Coulter machine used in this \nstudy. The size classification of phyllosilicate particles is clearly problematic by \nwhichever method is used to determine it. Finally, there are difficulties related to the \nmodels used to convert laser diffraction results into particle diameters.  \nThe Fraunhofer model assumes that particles are opaque and non-porous, so the \noptical properties of the particles are not considered, only diffraction of the laser. Mie \nTheory considers diffusion and absorption of the laser by the particles in addition to \ndiffraction, so knowledge of optical properties is required \n(http:\/\/www.cilasus.com\/theory\/index.html). Malvern Instruments (2000) note that the \nFraunhofer became the default model for laser granulometers in the 1970s because of \nlack of computing power. They show that for particles smaller than 50 \u00b5m, the Mie \ntheory gives more accurate estimates, but this was based on samples with a uni-modal \ndistribution. Bayvel and Jones (1981) also illustrate that the Fraunhofer model is less \nappropriate than Mie Theory for particles smaller than 5 \u00b5m and Buurman et al. (2001) \nnote that histograms of grain size distribution from the Fraunhofer model frequently show \na dip in the grain-size distribution around 1 \u00b5m which is probably an artefact of the \ncalculation method. However, despite these documented problems with the Fraunhofer \nmodel, the Mie Theory has not been widely adopted in soil science because the size \nfractions usually comprise a mixture of mineralogies for which it is difficult to determine \n 9 \nthe optical properties of. Konert and Vandenberghe (1997) also note that the Fraunhofer \nmodel is well-suited to non-spherical clay particles that make up much of the clay-sized \nfraction in soils and that the Mie-theory inversion procedure suppresses the amount of \nthis type of fine material measured compared with the Fraunhofer model. \nSeveral authors (Beuselinck, et al. 1998; Loizeau et al., 1994; McCave et al., \n1986 and Pieri et al., 2006) have observed that the clay-sized fraction is often under-\nestimated considerably by laser methods compared to sedimentation. The main reason \nsuggested is the shape of phyllosilicate clay minerals. Pedocchi and Garcia (2006) \ninvestigated both methods simultaneously and identified the difference in light scattering \nby irregularly shaped particles compared to spheres as the main source of error in \nestimates of the settling velocity, but this assumes that the settling velocities for such \nparticles are correct. Beuselinck et al. (1998) compared laser and sedimentation methods \non milled quartz and samples of silty soil; the results for both methods were similar for \nmilled quartz as particles are a regular and similar shape. The results for soil, however, \nare more difficult to interpret as they usually do not have a unimodal distribution or \nconsistent mineralogy. Other authors have emphasized the contribution that particle \ndensity makes to differences between laser and sedimentation methods. Fedotov et al. \n(2007) indicated that over-estimation of the clay fraction by 1.5\u20135 times can be related to \ndifferences in particle density. Zobeck (2004) observed that correlation between laser and \nsedimentation methods varied with mineralogy and was stronger when non-calcareous \nsoil samples were separated from calcareous ones.  \n \nMethods \n 10 \nStudy region \n \nOur study region comprises much of the area of lithomorphic chalk soil of England \n(Figure 1). The Chalk is subdivided into; the Grey and White Chalk Subgroups which \noutcrop in the northern, transitional and southern provinces (Figure 1). The composition \nof the chalk varies between provinces; the Grey Chalk contains most clay, whereas the \nWhite Chalk contains > 98 % calcium carbonate. The provinces have close stratigraphic \ncorrelations containing the same clay-rich marker beds suggesting that the broad mineral \ncompositions are similar (Mortimore et al., 2001). The clay mineral assemblage is \ndominated by smectite (Jeans, 2006) and soil on this bedrock is a Leptosol (IUSS \nWorking Group WRB, 2006) or rendzina (Avery, 1980). \n \nSample collection and analysis \nThe soil samples analyzed for this study are from three surveys: a survey of three \nneighbouring fields on the Yattendon Estate (the southern province), the National Soil \nInventory (NSI) (northern and transitional provinces) and the Geochemical Baseline \nSurvey of the Environment (G-BASE) (northern and transitional provinces) (Figure 1). \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \nYattendon \nTopsoil samples (0\u201315 cm) were taken on a 30-m grid (308 points total) over three arable \nfields on the Yattendon Estate in Berkshire; fields 214, 215 and 217 (Figures 1 and 2). \nThe fields were divided into landscape units (Figure 2). At each grid node, 6 cores of soil \n 11 \nfrom 1 m2 were bulked. Standard field observations were made at each grid node and \nstandard laboratory analyses (Avery and Bascomb, 1982) were done on the air-dry <2 \nmm fraction of samples (Table 1). The same methods were applied at four field sites on \ndifferent parent materials. The sites, Cricket Meadow (CM) and Football field (FF) were \ndeveloped on the Lower Greensand, Underwood (UW) on Oxford Clay and Wallingford \n(Wall) on plateau gravels. These sites give a range of non-chalk soils for comparison with \nthe Yattendon site. \n \nTable 1 near here  \n \nFifty samples were selected at random from each of the Yattendon fields for organic \nmatter analysis by Tinsley\u2019s (1950) wet oxidation method. The equation of the line fitted \nto the relation between loss on ignition (LOI) and Tinsley organic matter values was used \nto convert all LOI data to Tinsley values; these were then divided by 1.724 (MAFF, \n1986) to give organic carbon equivalents. Total carbon was determined using a LECO \nSC-444 carbon and sulphur analyser for 109 of the samples taken from all fields at \nYattendon. This completely removes the carbon (organic and inorganic) fractions as the \ntemperature reaches 950\u00baC. The percentage of organic carbon (Tinsley) was subtracted \nfrom the percentage of total carbon (LECO) to determine the percentage of inorganic \ncarbon in each sample. Average percentages of inorganic carbon as a percentage of total \ncarbon were determined for each landscape unit.  \nThree methods of particle size analysis were applied to the Yattendon samples.  \nHand-texturing of selected samples was done by a single observer by wetting the air-dry \n 12 \n<2 mm fraction of the soil and following the procedure of Nortcliff and Landon described \nin Rowell (1994). Sedimentation of selected samples was done by the pipette method of \nAvery and Bascomb (1982) following peroxide pre-treatment to remove organic matter. \nLaser psd was done by Natural Resource Management Limited (NRM \u2013 \nwww.nrm.uk.com) with < 1 g of air dry <2 mm soil dispersed in 3.3 % sodium \nhexametaphosphate solution by a Coulter laser granulometer without prior ultrasonic \ndispersal. An 8 \u00b5m threshold was used for the upper limit of the clay-sized fraction and \nthe Fraunhofer model was used. \nFor every batch of laboratory analyses, replicate, control and reference samples \nwere included to ensure analytical variation was within acceptable limits. \n \nNational Soil Inventory (NSI) \nSampling for the NSI was done between 1978 and 1983. Almost 5700 samples were \ntaken on a 5-km grid across England and Wales (McGrath and Loveland, 1992). The top-\nsoil (0-15 cm, excluding litter) was sampled. Twenty-five cores were taken at the nodes \nof a 5-m grid within a 20-m square centred on the 5-km grid node and bulked. The air dry \n< 2 mm fraction was used to determine psd (2 \u00b5m for clay\/silt boundary) by the pipette \nmethod following peroxide pre-treatment to remove organic matter (Avery and Bascomb, \n1982).  \n \nGeochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE)  \nSoil was sampled randomly within every other square kilometre of the British National \nGrid across eastern England (see 1). At each site five cores of topsoil (0-15 cm, excluding \n 13 \nlitter) were taken from the centre and corners of a 20-m square and bulked. Particle size \ndistribution was determined for 0.25 g of the air-dry <2 mm fraction of the soil which had \nbeen pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide and centrifugation to remove organic matter \nusing a Coulter laser granulometer and the Fraunhofer model. Reference standards were \nmeasured to ensure accuracy. The sand\/silt fraction boundary was 63 \u00b5m and for the \nsilt\/clay boundary values of 2 \u00b5m or 8 \u00b5m were used. \nA 50 g sub-sample was finely ground and the concentration of calcium (expressed \nas its weight percent oxide; CaO) was determined by wavelength dispersive XRFS (X-\nRay Fluorescence Spectrometry).  The concentration of calcium oxide will generally be \nlarge for chalk compared to non-chalk parent materials and Ca increases with carbonate \ncontent. \n For NSI and GBASE sample locations a parent material code (based on \ncombinations of solid or superficial geology) was assigned. from 1:50,000 maps of \nbedrock geology and superficial deposits of England, part of DigiMap GB (British \nGeological Survey, 2006). Locations with chalk parent material were selected from both \nthe NSI and G-BASE surveys. In addition, sampling locations with three other parent \nmaterials (blown sand, mudstone and tidal flats) were selected from the surveys so that \ndifferences in determining psd by laser granulometry and sedimentation on other parent \nmaterials could be compared to those observed for chalk. The distribution of samples \nderived from  each of the four parent materials from the NSI and G-BASE surveys is \nshown in Figure 1. \n \nScanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis \n 14 \nOne soil sample taken from the middle of the eastern part of field 215 (Figure 2) at \nYattendon was examined by SEM. It was split into two sub-samples; A (pure chalk) and \nB (a mixture of chalk and other soil mineral fragments) for characterization. Sub-samples \nwere mounted on aluminium stubs using Leit-C carbon cement and carbon adhesive tabs. \nThe sub-samples were carbon-coated then observed with an LEO 435 VP digital scanning \nelectron microscope (SEI). This was equipped with an Everhart-Thornley detector for \nsecondary electron imaging and a KE Developments four-quadrant (4 diode-type) solid-\nstate detector for backscattered electron imaging (BSEM). The SEM analysis was \nperformed by SEI under conventional high vacuum conditions, using a beam accelerating \nvoltage of 20 kV and a beam current of between 100-300 pA. Qualitative microchemical \nmineral composition was determined with an Oxford Instruments INCA energy-\ndispersive X-ray microanalysis system (EDXA). \n \nCorrelation Analysis \nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated between various soil variables and soil \nparticle size fractions for the Yattendon site as a whole (Yall) and for each of the 3 fields \nseparately (Y214, Y215 and Y217). Correlation coefficients between the same soil \nvariables were also determined for the other field sites where the soil has developed on \ndifferent parent materials (CM, FF, UW and Wall). As all these data were on a grid they \nare not independent, and the correlation coefficients will be larger than would be \nexpected if there was no spatial autocorrelation. Nevertheless, they provide a good \nindication of the relative strengths of the relations between variables. As sand, silt and \nclay are expressed as percentages of the air dry < 2 mm fraction of the soil they are \n 15 \nsubject to non-stochastic constraints because they must sum to 100%. This can lead to \nspurious correlations between compositional variables (Aitchison, 1986), and by \nimplication, the correlation of these fractions with other soil properties might be affected. \nA log-ratio transform can be applied to compositional variables, such as psd, (Lark and \nBishop, 2007) before computing the correlation coefficients.  \n The centred log-ratio (clr) transform of Aitchison (1986) was used here as it has \nbeen used successfully for compositional data in correlation analysis and principal \ncomponents analysis (PCA), (Neff, 1994). \n \nIf there is a composition X of D elements: \n],,...,,[ 21 Dxxx=X  \nsuch that \n  ,,...,2,1 Dixi =>  \nand  \n\u2211\n=\n=\nD\ni\nix\n1\n.1  \n \nThe centred log-ratio transform of an observation (xi) is: \n \n  )}){(\/)ln(()(clr ii xgx=X    (2) \n \nwhere g is the geometric mean of the elements of the composition: \n 16 \n \n  \nD\nDxxxg \u00d7\u00d7= ....21      (3) \n \nResults  \nThe Yattendon Survey \nThe soil at Yattendon has developed on the White Chalk. The soil on the plateau area and \nin the bottom of the valley is the darkest in colour (Figure 2) and that on the south-facing \nslopes is the lightest. The variation in soil colour at this site is related to soil depth; the \nshallower was the depth to chalk, the lighter the soil colour appeared. The colour of the \nsoil in the aerial photograph (Figure 2) is also governed by the amount of chalk at the \nsurface. The soil on the plateau has developed on clay with flints overlying the chalk, \nwhich has resulted in deeper and darker colour. The average inorganic carbon as a \npercentage of total carbon (Table 2) confirms the observations from the aerial photograph \nthat field 214, which comprises the north-facing slope and most of the plateau area, has \nthe least inorganic carbon or chalk in the topsoil (Figure 2). The topsoil of field 215, \nparticularly that on the south-facing slope, has the most inorganic carbon and chalk. \n \nTable 2 near here \n \nCorrelation analysis \nThe percentages of sand-, silt- and clay-sized particles at each grid node (Figure 2) \ndetermined by laser granulometry using an 8 \u00b5m threshold were used for this analysis. \n 17 \nThere were 308 sampling points for the site; each individual field has about 100. Pearson \ncorrelation coefficients (r) >0.195 are significant at the 0.05 level (Ebdon, 1994) for each \nfield. Table 3 gives the correlation coefficients between several soil properties and the \nraw clay, silt and sand percentages for the whole site (308 points). The values in bold \nemphasize the correlations between certain soil variables and the sand- and clay-sized \nfractions. Where the sand-sized fraction comprises mainly chemically inert quartz, its \ncorrelations with LOI, moisture correction factor (MCF) and volumetric water content \n(VWC) are typically negative. Table 3 shows that the reverse is generally true at \nYattendon where the correlations are positive. When the clay-sized fraction comprises \nchemically reactive phyllosilicate clay minerals, its correlations are generally positive \nwith LOI, MCF and VWC. Again the reverse is true at Yattendon where the correlations \nare negative (-0.351 < r <-0.541).  The correlation coefficients between soil properties \nand the clr transformed clay, silt and sand percentages for Yattendon are given in Table 4. \nThey are similar to those for the raw data (Table 3) in both strength and sign; they are not \nconsistently stronger or weaker. This indicates that the compositional nature of these data \nis not the cause of the correlations being the reverse of what we would expect. The \ncorrelations between raw sand, silt and clay data and other variables and the clr \ntransformed sand, silt and clay data and other variables were similar in sign and strength \nto those for the individual fields at Yattendon. Therefore, only the correlations for the clr \ntransformed data are given for each field. \n \nTables 3 and 4 near here \n \n 18 \nTables 5\u20137 give the correlations between the clr transformed sand, silt and clay \ndata and the other soil properties separately for each field at Yattendon. The correlations \nbetween clr sand and clay and the other soil properties are weak and insignificant in field \n214 (Table 5), and there is no pattern of positive or negative correlations. This field, \nwhich comprises the north-facing slope and most of the plateau area (Figure 2), has the \nsmallest proportions of inorganic carbon of the fields studied at Yattendon (Table 2). \nFigure 2 shows that this field is also markedly darker than the other two fields, which \nsuggests that the topsoil contains fewer chalk fragments. The depth of soil to chalk on the \nplateau is between 70 and 120 cm, and the parent material is clay with flints. \n \nTables 5-7 near here \n  \nThe correlations between clr sand and LOI, MCF and VWC are positive and \nmoderate, and those between clr clay and these properties are negative and moderate in \nfield 215 (Table 6). This field contains the south-facing slope, which has the largest \nproportion of inorganic carbon (15 % greater than the other fields, Table 2) and a small \npart of the plateau area (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows that this field is also markedly lighter \nin colour than field 214.  \n The correlations between clr sand and LOI, MCF and VWC are positive and those \nbetween clr clay and these properties are negative in field 217 (Table 7). The correlations \nfor this field are slightly weaker than those for field 215 (Tables 6 and 7). The valley in \nfield 217 (Figure 2) has the second largest proportion of inorganic carbon at the \nYattendon site (Table 2). The south-facing slope in this field is white (Figure 2), but this \n 19 \narea was not sampled, whereas the valley which was sampled is darker, but not as dark as \nfield 214.  \nTables 5\u20137 also show that for all fields there is a positive correlation between \nMunsell value and clr clay, and a negative one with clr sand. Lighter soil has larger \nMunsell values and vice versa. Darker coloured soil is often associated with large clay \nand organic matter contents, but again these typical relationships are the reverse here. \n The correlation results suggest that as the proportion of inorganic carbon increases \nthe soil becomes paler, and more chalk fragments are present. Furthermore, the \ncorrelations between clr sand and LOI, MCF and VWC become more strongly positive \nand those between clr clay and these variables become more strongly negative. We \nsuggest that this is so where soil has developed on chalk because a considerable \nproportion of the sand-sized fraction comprises porous chalk fragments which are \nchemically reactive and hold water unlike quartz grains that are usually typical of this \nfraction. In addition, we suggest that a significant proportion of the clay-sized fraction \ncomprises calcite crystals that are chemically unreactive, do not readily hold water and do \nnot have the platy shape of phyllosilicate clay minerals. As the 8 \u00b5m threshold for the \nboundary between the clay and silt-sized fractions was used here, some fine quartz grains \nfrom the silt-sized fraction could have been included in the clay-sized fraction. The \ndifferent mineralogy of the sand- and clay-sized fractions where soil has developed on \nchalk could account for the differences in the correlations between the particle size \nfractions and other soil properties. The correlation results between clay and LOI, MCF \nand VWC, and sand and LOI, MCF and VWC in Tables 3\u20137 are compared with those \nfrom the non-chalk sites in Table 8. They show that the relationships of LOI, MCF and \n 20 \nVWC with clay are all positive for the non-chalk sites and all negative for the chalk sites \n(except for clay and MCF for Y214), and the reverse is generally true for the \nrelationships of these variables with sand. Indeed, Kruskall Wallis H tests showed that \nthere were significant differences in the correlation coefficients for the chalk and non-\nchalk sites at a level of p < 0.001 showing that the differences in the relationships of these \nvariables at chalk and non-chalk sites is not likely to be due to chance. \n \nTable 8 near here \n \nComparison of the results of different methods to determine particle size  \nFigure 3 shows the textural class of the topsoil determined by different methods for the \nfour landscape units at Yattendon and for soil data at sites not on chalk parent material.  \nAll the diagrams show that determinations of psd based on sedimentation generally have \nless clay and more silt than those based on laser methods; the 8 \u00b5m threshold has been \nused for the latter. The divergence between the plotted points for the two methods is very \nsmall for sites where the soil was not developed on chalk (Figure 3e), and greatest for the \nplateau and south-facing slope at Yattendon (Figure 3b and c); the latter had the most \ninorganic carbon (Table 2) and the soil was the lightest in colour (Figure 2). For the north \nand south-facing slope and valley (Figure 3 a, c and d) hand-texturing indicated similar \nproportions of clay and silt to the sedimentation method, but less sand. The plateau area \nhad large organic matter contents as reflected in the dark colour of the soil (Figure 2). \n 21 \nHand-texturing was less reliable at determining the clay- and silt-sized fractions of this \nsoil and the sand fraction was markedly over-estimated. \n \nFigure 3 shows the differences in soil textural class based on the pipette and laser \nmethods where as Figure 4 shows the relationship between the values determined by \nthese methods for each particle size fraction. When Chalk and non-chalk samples are \nincluded together for regression (Figures 4 a, c and e) the relationship is strongest for \nsand and weakest for clay. This might be expected given that many of the problems with \nboth methods of particle size determination are associated with the clay fraction and the \nappropriate sizing of non-spherical phyllosilicates. When separate regression lines are \nfitted for the non-chalk soils and samples with > 4% CaCO3, it is evident that the slope of \nthe lines for sand are similar (Figure 4b), but the lines for samples with > 4% CaCO3 are \nsteeper than for the non-chalk soils for silt and clay (Figures 4 d and f). This difference in \nsteepness is most marked for clay (Figure 4 f). This difference in slope suggests that the 8 \n\u00b5m cutoff might not be appropriate for chalk soils as the relationship between laser and \nsedimentation methods is different.   \n \nFigures 3 and 4 near here \n \nScanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis \nThe sample from field 215 at Yattendon (Figure 2) was analysed by SEM by two \nindependent observers. The first observed that the sand-sized fraction comprised mostly \nporous chalk particles, a small quantity of angular quartz and some rounded quartz grains. \n 22 \nChalk particles and fragments, diagenetically smoothed quartz crystals and rounded \naggregates of calcite particles of <10 \u00b5m were present. Some weathered feldspars could \nalso be seen in this size range. At \u22645 \u00b5m crystalline calcite rhombs were clearly visible. \nAt <1 \u00b5m, the material was largely calcite in the form of rounded grains with identifiable \nfaceted crystal faces. At <1 \u00b5m there were fewer fragments of clay minerals than one \nwould expect; illite was clearly visible and kaolinite might be present. Coccoliths are \nvisible throughout the size ranges and some fragmented coccoliths were probably \nincluded in the <1 \u00b5m aggregates of calcite material (Pers. Comm., Peter Bull, \nDepartment of Geography, University of Oxford). \n Based on SEI results, the second observer noted that a substantial proportion of \nthe pure chalk fragments in the soil comprise coccoliths; the outer walls of minute \nplanktonic algae (coccolithophores). Coccoliths are formed of calcium carbonate plates, \neach less than 3\u00b5m, that are aggregated to form composite particles, up to 10 \u00b5m in \ndiameter, that typically have ring-like structures. Coccolith rings and degraded \ncomponent calcite plates comprise most of sub-sample A (silt and sand-sized fractions, \nFigure 5). Most of the clay-sized fraction in the sub-sample is dominated by crystalline \ncalcite <2 \u00b5m in size. Coarser crystals of calcite (some of which could be part of the \nprimary, bioclastic sediment) are dispersed within a clay mineral matrix (Figures 5 and \n6).  \n \nFigures 5 and 6 near here \n \n Sub-samples A and B are quite different; the latter comprises disaggregated \n 23 \nmineral grains and possibly organic debris. The mineral grain size varies between 1 and \n40 \u00b5m, and most of the calcite grain edges are rounded and etched. The mineral grains \nare often interlocked and the pores are frequently blocked by clay-sized particles. \nSecondary electron images suggest that coccoliths and foraminifera bioclasts are \ndegraded to smaller, irregular calcite particles.  \n The SEM results for both sub-samples suggest that there is some dissolution of \nchalk in the soil and that secondary porosity could be developed within the component \nchalk clasts. These pores are more than 10\u201330 \u00b5m, larger than those in the background \nchalk matrix because of dissolution and leaching of calcite grains. The morphology of the \nleached voids resembles the original mineral or clast morphology (Figure 7). The matrix \nof both sub-samples is composed of calcite particles (up to 2 \u00b5m) with rounded edges and \novergrowth zones. The proportion of clay minerals is relatively small, however, \nauthigenic tubular alumino-silicate fibres up to 5 \u00b5m in length and about 0.25 \u00b5m in \ndiameter are observeable. Some of the clay minerals form a \u201cmesh\u201d of tubes and \ncylinders that bind mineral particles together which contributes to the blocking of pores. \nOther clay minerals, such as illite and kaolinite might also be present, although they \ncannot be clearly defined from the existing observations.  \n \nFigure 7 near here \n \nThe NSI and G-BASE surveys \n 24 \nFigure 8 shows the ternary diagrams for four soil parent materials; Chalk, Blown Sand, \nMudstone and Tidal Flats using psd information determined by sedimentation for the NSI \nand by laser for the G-BASE survey. Two diagrams are given for each parent material to \nshow the range of soil textures for the 2 and 8 \u00b5m thresholds when psd is determined by \nthe laser method. Ideally, comparisons of the two methods should be made with soil \nsamples from the same locations, however, such data are not currently available. \nNevertheless, there are two reasons to suggest that a comparison based on samples from \nindependent sites would not affect the results adversely. First, the samples from each \nsurvey cover a broad geographic area with a significant proportion of lithomorphic chalk \nsoil (Figure 1) and similar range of soil types. Second, the ternary diagrams (Figures 8a \nand 8e) and histograms (not shown) show that the samples encompass a broad range of \nsoil psd and have similar distributiosn, and there is also a wide range of values for the \nsand-sized fractions, the fraction that is identified most reliably by both methods (i.e. NSI \nsedimentation, 18\u201395 % sand; G-BASE laser, 10\u201385% sand). We feel justified, therefore, \nin drawing some general conclusions from a comparison of these two datasets. Here we \nare not interested in the textural class that the chalk soil falls into given the different \nboundaries, but the range of values of sand, silt and clay that are identified for two \nsurveys that cover the same broad geographic region. \n \nFigure 8 near here \n \n Table 9 gives the mean and range of percentage calcium (expressed as weight \npercent oxide) in samples from the G-BASE survey over four parent materials. For the \n 25 \nchalk soil, the concentration of calcium will be dominated by the quantity of carbonate \n(calcite) in each sample. For soil developed on the other three parent materials, Ca \nreflects the quantities of all Ca bearing minerals, including calcite, phyllosilcates and \nfeldspar. The greater Ca concentrations in the chalk soil (Table 9) indicate it contains \nmarkedly larger amounts of calcite than soil samples from the three other parent \nmaterials. \n \nTable 9 near here \n \n Figure 8 a\u2013d shows that when a 2 \u00b5m threshold is used for the laser results, the \nrange of particle size fractions for the NSI and G-BASE data is not comparable. The \nparticle size fractions determined by laser from the G-BASE survey appear to have less \nclay and more silt than those determined by sedimentation from the NSI survey. The        \n8 \u00b5m threshold essentially redistributes part of the silt fraction to the clay fraction. Figure \n8 f\u2013h shows that when the 8 \u00b5m threshold is used for soil developed on non-calcareous \nparent materials, the psd identified by sedimentation and laser methods in the two surveys \noverlaps. The 8 \u00b5m threshold was suggested by Konert and Vanenberghe (1997) for \ngeneral use, but when used for soil developed on chalk (Figure 8e) samples measured by \nlaser from the G-BASE survey appear to have more clay and less silt than those from the \nNSI survey, which used sedimentation. This is the same pattern as was observed for the \nYattendon data. The ternary diagrams for chalk soils (Figure 8 a and e), suggest that the  \n8 \u00b5m threshold over-corrects for chalk samples because the laser results change from \n 26 \nunder-estimating clay content when the 2 \u00b5m threshold is used, to over-estimating it with \nthe 8 \u00b5m threshold.  \n While Figure 8 is concerned with differences in the texture of the soil on different \nparent materials using the 2 and 8 \u00b5m cut-offs, Figure 9 shows the relationships between \nlaser and sedimentation methods for each parent material and particle size fraction. As \nthe NSI and GBase surveys used different sampling points, but the broad geographical \nareas and histograms for each size fraction for each of the surveys were similar in range \nand mean etc., correlations were calculated between summary statistics (minimum, \nmaximum, mean, median, lower quartile and upper quartile) for each survey on a given \nparent material. The only exception to this procedure was for the G-BASE survey for \nBlown sand where following examination of the histogram, two extreme outliers with \nvery low sand contents were removed before calculation of the summary statistics.  \n \nThe most important feature in Figure 9 is the consistency in the slope of the regression \nlines for clay (Figure 9c) for parent materials other than chalk (0.38-0.47x) and which \ncorrespond to similar gradients identified in previous studies. Eschel et al. (2004) found a \ngradient of 0.35x, Konert and Vandenberghe (1997), 0.36x, Beuselinck et al. (1998), \n0.35x and  Buurman et al. (2001), 0.29x and 0.39x for Marine and Loess sediments, \nrespectively. In contrast to these gradients, that for chalk soil is 0.71x approximately \ndouble that reported by others, and here, for non-chalk soils. Also, the gradient for the \nline for chalk soils (8 \u00b5m) in Figure 4 for the Yattendon site was slightly more than \ndouble that of the line for non-chalk sites. These differences in regression line slopes for \n 27 \nchalk and on-chalk soils indicate how differences in the mineralogy can significantly \ninfluence the particle size determined by both methods. \n The results confirm that the 8 \u00b5m cut-off is suitable for non-chalk soils. The \ndifferences in psd determined by the laser and sedimentation methods when the 8 \u00b5m \nthreshold is used for laser results (Figures 3 and 8) and the differences in the slopes of the \nregression lines for chalk and non-chalk soils for clay (Figure 9c) can be accounted for by \ndifferences in particle density and shape for chalk soils. Mineralogically, calcite is denser \nthan quartz (Klein and Hurlbut, 1993). However, fine (a few microns in diameter) calcite \nparticles in chalk soil will aggregate to form chalk fragments (Sumbler, 1996), which are \nporous and less dense than quartz particles of the same size. Therefore, they take longer \nto fall a given distance through water as a smaller particle would. This means that the \nproportion of clay- and silt-sized particles can be over-estimated by the sedimentation \nanalysis of a chalk soil. It seems that the average particle density of 2600 kg m-3 is not \nappropriate for particle size determination of chalky soil.  \n The over-estimation of the clay-sized particles with the 8 \u00b5m threshold and the \nsteeper slopes of the regression lines for chalk soil can also be attributed to differences in \nparticle shape. When using laser methods, this threshold essentially adjusts for the fact \nthat much of the clay-sized fraction identified by sedimentation is dominated by platy, \nphyllosilicate clay minerals. If these minerals are oriented so that the laser beam \nintercepts them along their long-axis they would appear larger than their average \ndiameter suggests. Pabst et al. (2000) found that for samples rich in clay minerals, \nmodification of Stokes\u2019 law to deal with the plate-like shape of such minerals meant that \nsedimentation results were in good agreement with laser methods. Lerman et al. (1974), \n 28 \nLu et al. (2000) and Pabst et al. (2001) have also looked at Stokes\u2019 theory of settling \nvelocities for particles of different shape. This suggests that it is the sedimentation \nmethods that need to be adjusted. The issue of particle shape does not need to be \ncompensated for with chalk soil where the clay-sized fraction is composed largely of tiny \ncalcite crystals.  \nAlthough adjusting thresholds between the size fractions to gain agreement between laser \nand sedimentation methods is basically unsound, it provides an interim practical solution \nfor comparison with the large amount of particle size analysis that has been done in the \npast using sedimentation methods. The 2 \u00b5m threshold (or some threshold less than 8 \n\u00b5m) would correspond with the proportions of sand-, silt- and clay-sized particles if \nparticle shape was taken into account when psd is determined by sedimentation. \nTypically, particle shape is not accounted for with sedimentation methods, but Scott-\nJackson and Walkington (2005) suggested a boundary of between 6.5 and 7.5 \u00b5m for \ndirect correlation between sedimentation and laser methods for a clay with flints soil \ndeveloped over chalk. For this parent material, chalk contributes to less of the mineral \nmatter than for a lithomorphic chalk soil. Therefore a threshold less than this should be \nsuitable for lithomorphic chalk soil. Figure 9 shows ternary diagrams of the psd of the \ntop-soil determined by laser and sedimentation methods for the NSI and G-BASE soil \nsamples developed on chalk with a 4 \u00b5m cut-off for the clay:silt boundary for laser \nmethods, cut-offs of 5 and 6 \u00b5m were also investigated but are not shown. This diagram \nshows that there is considerable overlap between the sedimentation (NSI survey) and \nlaser methods (G-BASE survey) when a 4 \u00b5m cut-off for the clay\/silt boundary is used \n 29 \nfor laser methods. Clearly an appropriate threshold for the clay\/silt boundary for laser \nmethods will depend on soil carbonate content and its particle size.  \n \nFigure 9 near here \n \nDiscussion \nOur results have considerable implications for determining the psd of soils developed on \nchalk which contain a significant proportion of lithogenic calcium carbonate. For \nexample, in England chalk is the parent material for soil over 8825 km2, about 7 % of the \nsoilscape. Based on land cover data (Fuller et al., 1994), about half of the area of \nlithomorphic chalk soil is used for arable agriculture, which is some 8.5% of the total \narable area in England. In addition, there are seven NSAs underlain by chalk parent \nmaterial in England (Figure 1; MAgiC, 2008a; British Geological Survey, 2006). Based \non the map of soil parent material (British Geological Survey, 2006), we have determined \nthat about 70% of the area of lithomorphic chalk soil (6178 km2) is classified as an NVZ  \n(MAgiC, 2008b). There is clearly scope for improving recommendations for fertilizer \napplication rates based on an improved understanding of the psd of chalk-soil and water-\nholding properties to reduce the leaching of nitrate to water. \n Given the problems of laser and sedimentation methods for determining psd on \nchalk, hand-texturing should be used initially to give an indication of soil texture that can \nbe compared with the results from sedimentation and laser methods. Soil surveyors have \nnoted that soil developed on chalk often feels more silty than the analytical results \n 30 \nindicate, but the psd is usually based on sedimentation methods which can over-estimate \nthe clay sized fraction when phyllosilicates are present.  \n Typical agricultural soil often has clay-sized fractions dominated by chemically \nreactive, moisture holding phyllosilicate minerals and sand-sized fractions dominated by \nchemically inert quartz grains that do not readily hold moisture. The SEM analysis \nshowed that moisture-holding, porous chalk fragments comprise much of the sand-sized \nfraction in chalk soil and that fine calcite crystals, which do not readily hold water, \nconstitute a significant proportion of the clay-sized fraction. Correlation analysis showed \nthat these differences in mineralogy had implications for the behaviour of the soil and \nthat relationships were different for chalk and non-chalk soil. Relations between soil \ntexture and important soil properties in chalk soil were the reverse of those commonly \nobserved in soil dominated by silicate minerals, and the strength of these relationships \nincreased with the proportion of inorganic carbon in the soil. For chalk soil with \nsignificant quantities of calcite in the clay-size fraction, the 8 \u00b5m threshold over-corrects \nthe partition between clay and silt because the clay-sized fraction is not dominated by \nphyllosilicates with their non-spherical geometry. Sedimentation methods can slightly \nover-estimate the clay content when using an average particle density for calculations, but \nthis effect appears to be smaller than phyllosilicate mineral shape. \n  \nConclusions \nFrom this study, we suggest an interim solution to the problems associated with analysis \nof psd in chalk soil would be to use a clay\/silt boundary of 4 \u00b5m for the psd determined \nby laser to correspond with the results from sedimentation. This is not an optimal \n 31 \nsolution; these two methods are measuring slightly different things soshifting boundaries \nbetween the size fractions does not solve the problem. However, based on our \nobservations in this study, it does provide a means of overcoming this difficulty in the \nshort-term, until a more theoretically sound  solution is found.  \n \nLand managers need to know how agrochemicals will move through the soil which is \nstrongly related to fundamental soil properties, including psd and mineralogy. This is a \ncomplex problem for soil developed on chalk because there are major differences in the \nphysical and chemical behaviour of the minerals in the clay- and sand-sized fractions in \ncomparison to most other soil types, as highlighted by the correlation and SEM analysis \nin this study. It is difficult to predict soil properties such as water-holding capacity \nbecause of the differences in composition of the sand and clay fractions. Further \ninvestigation of the mineralogy and behaviour of the particle size fractions of chalk soil is \nrequired so that fertilizer and pesticide recommendations can be adjusted accordingly. \nThis is important because 70 % of the Chalk outcrop in England is classified as an NVZ.  \n \nOn a more theoretical note, the relative merits of the Fraunhofer model and Mie theory \nneed to be assessed for laser psd of chalk soils given the porosity of the sand-sized \nparticles.  There is clearly a requirement for these two models to be combined; the greater \naccuracy of the former for small size fractions with the benefits of the latter for the larger \nsize fractions. Further research is also needed to determine an appropriate particle density \nfigure for sedimentation analysis of chalk soil. An adaptation of standard sedimentation \nmethods might also be needed to account for differences in shape and mineralogy of the \n 32 \nsize fractions. This would be a more theoretically sound way of proceeding than the \napplication of an arbitrary boundary between clay and silt for laser methods because it \nwould vary with the proportion of carbonate in the soil. However, it would probably \nresult in various soil types being attributed with different behaviour than is traditionally \nassociated with them because most notions of soil behaviour are extrapolated from \nstandard sedimentation analysis. \n When measuring the psd of chalk soil, practitioners need to consider the impact \ntheir chosen method will have on their results. An alternative procedure would be to \nmeasure psd before and after the removal of calcite from their samples using acid. This \nwould estimate the proportion of calcite in each size fraction and this could be used to \ninfer the behaviour of agrochemicals in such soil. We suggest that samples should not be \nshaken or treated with ultrasound to avoid destroying the fragile, porous chalk fragments \nthat make up much of the sand-sized fraction. With further research, agro-chemical \nmanufacturers should provide separate application guidelines for chalk soil, given its \nunique properties which are related to its composition. It is beyond the scope of this paper \nto redefine the textural classes based on sedimentation. However, to apply and compare \nlaser methods properly to sedimentation methods, such a major change in standard \nmethodology may be needed. This is particularly so given the savings in time and money \nwith the use of laser methods and the importance to practitioners who need to know the \npsd of many sample for precise management.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n 33 \nThe first author was a visiting scholar at the Grant F.
