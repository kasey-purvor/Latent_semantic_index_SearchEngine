Since the physical interfaces can never be absolutely\nsmooth, understanding the relationship between the elec-\ntronic wave functions and the imperfections of the interface\ncontinues to be an active topic for research.1\u20136\nExcitonic emission as seen in photoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002\nspectra can be inhomogeneously broadened by quantum well\n\u0001QW\u0002 thickness fluctuations. If the QW thickness Lz depen-\ndent transition energy ET\u0001Lz\u0002 obeys an effective mass-type\nrelationship, ET\u0001Lz\u0002=Eg+ALz\n\u2212\u0001\n, where A and \u0001 are two fit-\nting parameters and Eg the bandgap, then the emission line-\nwidth \u0002 is expected2 to scale as \u0002\u0003Lz\n\u2212\u0001\u0001+1\u0002\u0004Lz. This dimen-\nsional argument suggests that if \u0004Lz, the magnitude of\ninterface fluctuations, is independent of the well width Lz,\nthe effective strength of the interface disorder is inversely\ndependent on the well width. One may refine this argument\nsomewhat to include lateral correlations in the disorder\npotential,2,3 provided that the correlation length \u00051 of the\ninterface disorder potential is much smaller than the averag-\ning volume \u0001exciton size aB\u0002. In the context of high quality\nheterostructures, \u00051 is associated with interface fluctuations\non the monolayer scale. These monolayer fluctuations will\nexist even without any growth nonuniformity and are an in-\nevitable consequence of having a semiconductor alloy form-\ning the barrier region. For example, in\nAl0.3Ga0.7As \/GaAs \/Al0.3Ga0.7As QWs, the barrier itself is a\nrandom Al0.3Ga0.7As alloy and Ga\u2013Al bonds only occur in\n30% of the cases. Thus, the notion of a sharp interface, in-\nspired by a virtual crystal picture, is naive. Monolayer and\nlarger, random fluctuations must always exist. The excitonic\nlinewidth due to these fluctuations2 is given by\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002ET\n\u0002Lz\n\u0005\u00051\naB\n\u0006 \u0003 \u0004Lz\nLz\n\u0001+1\u0005\u00051aB\u0006, \u00051 \u0006 aB. \u00011\u0002\nThe \u0003\u00051 \/aB\u0004 factor, which considerably reduces the effect of\nthese fluctuations on the exciton, is simply the consequence\nof the 1 \/\u0007N law for the second moments of a random\nvariable.3 Physically, this disorder averaging is another mani-\nfestation of the well-studied motional narrowing\nphenomenon.3 In the past, this sensitivity to the exciton size\nhas been quite spectacularly demonstrated in magnetic field\nB dependent PL measurements. Many groups have observed\na field-dependent enhancement in the emission linewidth. It\nfollows from Eq. \u00011\u0002 that the squeezing of the exciton wave-\nfunction would lead to a reduced disorder averaging7\u20139 and,\nconsequently, an increase in the PL linewidth.\nInterestingly, this is completely contradictory to some\nearlier measurements10,11 where the linewidth was observed\nto decrease as a function of magnetic field. These old obser-\nvations have largely been ignored and the considerable the-\noretical and experimental work on the subject in the last two\ndecades has only focused on the magnetic field-induced en-\nhancement of the emission linewidth.\nWe have revisited this problem in the present study. Spe-\ncifically, we will discuss a GaAs multi-QW sample where the\ndisorder-induced inhomogeneous broadening is about an or-\nder of magnitude larger than the homogeneous broadening\nfor GaAs QWs. Our paper describes results of PL measure-\nments on such QWs in high magnetic fields up to 50 T.\nFour independent Al0.3Ga0.7As \/GaAs \/Al0.3Ga0.7As QWs\nwith thicknesses of 20, 30, 50, and 100 \u00c5 were contained\nwithin a single sample. The QWs were grown in a horizontala\u0002Electronic mail: bhavtosh.bansal@science.ru.nl.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 91, 251108 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/91\u000325\u0001\/251108\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics91, 251108-1\nDownloaded 03 Jan 2008 to 194.80.32.9.

The\nQWs are uncoupled due to a 1300 \u00c5 thick Al0.30Ga0.70As\nbarrier separating each well. Since all the QWs are in the\nsame sample, the other sample characteristics, in particular,\nthe background impurity levels, can be assumed to be con-\nstant across the QWs.\nNonresonant PL measurements were performed in a liq-\nuid helium bath cryostat using a green diode-pumped\nfrequency-doubled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum\ngarnet laser in pulsed fields up to 50 T. The spectra were\nmeasured using an intensified charge-coupled device detec-\ntor. Figure 1 describes the PL measurements done at 4.2 K\nand B=0. In Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, individual peaks from the four QWs\nand the GaAs substrate are separately resolved. The spectral\nlineshapes are asymmetric, with the asymmetry of the peaks\ninversely related to the well thickness. This is most probably\ndue to contributions from free and interface fluctuation-\nbound excitons.7 However, in the absence of a clear splitting\nof the QW emission spectrum into two distinct peaks, the\nwhole spectrum is better treated as a composite entity. There-\nfore, instead of making assumptions about the spectral line-\nshape and, for example, fitting multiple Gaussians or more\ncomplex Lorentz-Gaussian lineshapes8 to a PL spectrum\nI\u0001E\u0002, a direct and fitting-parameter-free interpretation of the\nspectra is obtained by relating the peak emission energy and\nthe linewidth to the first moment \u0001\u201ccenter of mass\u201d= \bE\t\u0002\nand the second moment of energy \u0001\u0002=\u0007\bE2\t\u2212 \bE\t2\u0002. Here,\n\bEn\t=\nEnI\u0001E\u0002dE \/\nI\u0001E\u0002dE. The use of the term linewidth in\nthis paper refers to this standard deviation \u0002, which for a\nGaussian lineshape is, of course, \u00031 \/ \u00012\u00072 ln 2\u0002\u0004\u0007 the full\nwidth at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002.\nFigures 1\u0001b\u0002 and 1\u0001c\u0002 show the PL energies and the line-\nwidths corresponding to the four QWs as a function of well\nwidth. An inverse relationship between the PL linewidth and\nQW thickness \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004 suggests an important role of inter-\nface roughness in determining the exciton broadening. How-\never, the actual dependence of the linewidth on the well\nwidth \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004 is found to be \u0002\u000bL\u22120.5 and is much weaker\nthan the expected \u0002\u000b\u0002ET \/\u0002Lz\u000bL\u22122 \u0003since ET\u000bL\u22121 from\nFig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. This suggests that \u0003\u0005 \/aB\u0004 is not constant for the\ndifferent QWs.\nFigure 2 shows the variation of the PL linewidths of the\nfour QWs as a function of magnetic field. The expected2,9\nincrease in the linewidth with magnetic field is observed only\nin the thinnest QWs, where the linewidth increases by about\n10% in a field of 50 T. From Eq. \u00011\u0002, this corresponds9 to a\nshrinkage of the excitonic radius by the same amount. The\n10 and 5 nm thick QWs, on the other hand, show a clear\ndecrease in the linewidth. In fact, there seems to be a gradual\ncrossover from the field-induced decrease to a field-induced\nincrease in the emission linewidth as we go from the thick to\nthe thin QWs. As mentioned earlier, the observations of the\ndecrease in linewidth, from the point of view of more recent\ntheories, seem to be quite unexpected. However, they do\nhave a very striking resemblance to the two decade old data\nof Sasaki et al.10 on QWs with similar linewidths. Unfortu-\nnately, Sasaki et al. did not provide a satisfactory explanation\nfor the observations. The field-induced decrease in linewidth\nwas attributed to the suppression of homogeneous broaden-\ning \u0001phonon\u0002 processes, whereas it is now quite well estab-\nlished that the FWHM due to phonon scattering is only8 of\nthe order of 0.5 meV.\nSince there is no theoretical framework to understand the\nmagnetic field-induced suppression of PL linewidth, we shall\noutline a plausible physical mechanism. It is likely that,\nalong with the inevitable short-ranged monolayer alloy\nfluctuations,3 the QW may also have longer ranged \u201creal\u201d\nwell-width fluctuations. This would also explain the large\nlinewidths in our samples. \u0003For example, the molecular-\nbeam-epitaxially-grown 2 nm QW sample measured in Ref.\n5 has a linewidth of 3 meV \u0001FWHM=7 meV\u0002 compared to\n8 meV in our case.\u0004 The roughness of the interface would be\nvery dependent on the conditions prevailing in the reactor at\nthe time of growth. For instance, the actual morphology of\nthe growing surface is known to be very sensitive to the\ngrowth kinetics parameters; higher growth rates and lower\ngrowth temperatures lead to growth of rough surfaces. We\npostulate that such fluctuations occurring on a length scale\n\u00052\u000baB are the primary source of disorder in our QWs. These\nlonger ranged fluctuations would be expected to carry the\ncorrelations across the other interface over much larger well\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Photoluminescence spectrum of the GaAs\nmulti-QW sample measured at 4.2 K and B=0.

This is also supported by the observation in\nFig. 1\u0001c\u0002, where the well-width dependence of the linewidth\nhad a weaker dependence of the inverse well-width than\nwould be expected from the dimensional arguments of Eq.\n\u00011\u0002.\nTo see how the introduction of a larger correlation length\ncan lead to the observed field-induced decrease in linewidth,\nconsider the following simple argument: The global fluctua-\ntion of the QW thickness can be assigned an in-plane\nposition-dependent effective potential, V\u0001x ,y\u0002\n=\u0002E \/\u0002Lz\b\bLz\u0001x ,y\u0002\taB, where \bLz\u0001x ,y\u0002 is the variation over\nthe mean thickness at the in-plane position coordinate \u0001x ,y\u0002.\nThe angular brackets \b\u00af\taB denote averaging over the exci-\nton size. We assume that this fluctuation has the form\n\bLz\u0001\t\u0002=A exp\u0003\u2212\t \/\u00052\u0004, where \u00052\u000baB is the length \u0001measured\nin the plane of the quantum well\u0002 over which the fluctuation\nis active and \t is just the transformation from cartesian to\nin-plane circular coordinates. Then, the broadening is just\nproportional to the square of this fluctuation averaged over\nthe exciton size; i.e., the linewidth as a function of the exci-\nton size can be written as\n\u00022 \u0003\n\u0002E\n\u0002Lz\n\f\n0\naB\nexp\u0003\u2212 \t\/\u00052\u0004d\t =\n\u0002E\n\u0002Lz\n\u00031 \u2212 e\u2212aB\/\u00052\u0004 . \u00012\u0002\nThe above expression predicts a decrease in the linewidth as\nthe excitonic Bohr radius is shrunk in the applied magnetic\nfield \u0001aB\u000b1 \/\u0007B\u0002. In the limit of the correlation length being\nmuch larger than the exciton, Eq. \u00012\u0002 reduces to\n\u00022 \u0003 \u0005 \u0002E\u0002Lz\u0006\u0005aB\u00052\u0006 for \u00052 \n aB, \u00013\u0002\nwhich is in complete contrast with Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nThe above back-of-the-envelope derivation is supported\nby the qualitative picture shown in Fig. 3. In a magnetic\nfield, the excitonic wave function would reduce in size and,\ntherefore, encounter less of the fluctuating interface. For\nfluctuations which vary on a length scale comparable to the\nexcitonic size, this would lead to a decrease in the linewidth.\nA reduced averaging of the local monolayer fluctuations\nwould, on the other hand, increase the exciton linewidth.\nThis gives rise to the competing behavior observed in the\nfour samples \u0001Fig. 2\u0002. It is interesting that the thinner QW\nwith a larger linewidth seems to be more sensitive to the\nsmall scale potential fluctuations. This is tentatively attrib-\nuted to much stronger exciton localization in the thinner\nwells, due to the larger effective disorder \u0001\bL \/L\u0002 and line-\nwidth, and because the thinner QW is closer to being an ideal\ntwo-dimensional system.\nIn summary, we have studied the magnetophotolumines-\ncence spectra of highly disordered quantum wells with inter-\nmediate thicknesses of 20 \u00c5\u000bLz\u000b100 \u00c5 in magnetic fields\nup to 50 T. The linewidth associated with excitonic emission\nshows a complex behavior, it can either decrease or increase\nin the magnetic field. The field-induced decrease in linewidth\nwas attributed to an inhomogeneous broadening contribution\nfrom an interface disorder potential that varies on the scale of\nthe exciton Bohr radius.\nWe thank Sandip Ghosh for useful discussions and initial\ncharacterization of the QWs.
