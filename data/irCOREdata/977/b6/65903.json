His points are well made and generally unexceptionable. However, since David\nDunn takes an article I wrote in 19992 as the starting point for several of his\ncriticisms, I thought I would take the opportunity to offer a response. I have three\nmain points to make.\nFirstly, there are a number of straw men hovering around Dunn\u2019s argument.\nMyths four to six in particular (\u2018isolationism is the \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 foreign policy of the\nUnited States\u2019; \u2018the Founding Fathers advocated an isolationist foreign policy for\nthe new Republic\u2019; \u2018the isolationism of the interwar period shows how easy it is for\nthe US to slip into its \u2018\u2018traditional\u2019\u2019 isolationist foreign policy\u2019) would be accepted by\nhardly any serious scholars of the subject. Dunn is correct to note that US foreign\npolicy textbooks print selective extracts from George Washington\u2019s Farewell Address\nwithout giving adequate contextual commentary. However, one needs only to\nconsult, for example, the 2002 edition of the Encyclopedia of American Foreign\nPolicy, edited by DeConde, Burns and Logevall,3 to appreciate that the academic\nconsensus on American isolationism is much more sophisticated than Dunn implies.\nAs Manfred Jonas puts it, in a piece precisely designed to reflect the current accepted\nwisdom, both Washington and Jefferson \u2018actually sought to increase American\ncontacts with the outside world\u2019.4 In a famous article published in 1954, William\nAppleman Williams, surely one of the most influential of all authorities on the history\nof US foreign policy, argued \u2018that the absence of genuine economic isolationism\ndemonstrates the mythical nature of the entire concept\u2019.5 Obviously, partisan\npolitical debate rarely achieves the sophistication of academic analysis. In such a\ncontext, the term \u2018isolationism\u2019 is (like the terms \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019) used\nvery loosely. Such imprecisions may also find their way into more scholarly writing.\nThere, however, they hardly attain the status of consensual myth.\nMy second point concerns the purpose of my 1999 article. Like David Dunn, I was\nconcerned about unsatisfactory uses of the word \u2018isolationism\u2019, in the US post-Cold\n1 David H. Dunn, \u2018Isolationism Revisited: Seven Persistent Myths in the Contemporary American\nForeign Policy Debate\u2019, Review of International Studies, 31:2 (2005), pp. 237\u201361.\n2 John Dumbrell, \u2018Varieties of Post-Cold War American Isolationism\u2019, Government and Opposition,\n24:1 (1999), pp. 24\u201343.\n3 Alexander DeConde, Richard Dean Burns and Frederik Logevall (eds.), Encyclopedia of American\nForeign Policy, vol. 2, 2nd edn. (New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 2002).\n4 Manfred Jonas, \u2018Isolationism\u2019, ibid., pp. 337\u201351, 338.\n5 Ibid., p. 351. William A. Williams, \u2018The Legend of Isolationism in the 1920s\u2019, Science and Society,\n18:1 (1954), pp. 19\u201335.\n699\nWar foreign policy debate. Like Dunn, I quoted Paul Weyrich\u2019s comment: that\n\u2018isolationism\u2019 was a \u2018conjuring trick by the internationalists, a hoodoo they call\nup whenever they feel threatened\u2019.6 As Dunn concedes, I clearly distinguished\n\u2018isolationism\u2019 from \u2018unilateralism\u2019. The point of the 1999 piece was to identify four\n\u2018impulses\u2019 which, at least potentially, called into question \u2018the general thrust of\npost-1945 US internationalism\u2019.7 (My four were \u2018unilateralism\u2019; \u2018nationalism,\nAmerica First and the New Populism\u2019; \u2018anti-globalization\u2019; and \u2018anti-imperialism\u2019.)\nIn so doing, I, perhaps unwisely, attempted to rescue the term, \u2018isolationism\u2019 from the\nrealm of invective and imbue it with a neutral, descriptive content. Understood in\nthese terms, I do not see that the points made in my article are actually very different\nfrom those made by Dunn. I agree with Dunn that I probably exaggerated the force\nof the Pat Buchanan brand of (dare I write it?) \u2018neo-isolationism\u2019. (It is still worth\nrecalling, however, that Buchanan actually won the 1996 Republican Presidential\nprimary in New Hampshire.) What is clear is that \u2018nationalism\u2019 in US foreign policy\nafter 9\/11 has been re-energised, not towards some form of neo-isolationism, but\ntowards new assertions of global power. (Reading my pre-9\/11 article again is akin to\npeering into a remote world of lost innocence.)\nThe third comment is more specific and relates to my interpretation of President\nClinton\u2019s policy of \u2018multilateral restraint\u2019, and especially of his Presidential Directive\n25. I am accused of besmirching \u2018multilateral restraint\u2019 with the \u2018isolationist slur\u2019.8 I\nrepeat that my whole purpose in the innocent days of 1999 was to use \u2018isolationist\u2019\nin a neutral, descriptive rather than an abusive way. I was writing in the spirit of\nEric Nordlinger\u2019s Isolationism Reconfigured.9 Clinton\u2019s policy had at least the\npotential to call into question \u2018the general thrust of post-1945 US internationalism\u2019.\nIn the heady atmosphere of the early post-Cold War era it was presumably intended\nto do just that. No slur intended! As for PD 25, I accept that I should have related\nmy remarks more clearly to US relations with the United Nations and also made a\nclearer distinction between \u2018isolationism\u2019 and \u2018non-intervention\u2019. However, in many\nparts of the world, US diplomatic engagement is not credible in the absence of the\nprospect of some willingness to deploy military forces. Like the general policy of\n\u2018multilateral restraint\u2019, PD 25 surely was, in the wake of the Somalian deployment,\nalso a calling into question of \u2018the general thrust of post-1945 US internationalism\u2019\n(not least the precedent of the Vietnam War).\nTo conclude, David Dunn has produced a valuable addition to the debate over\nAmerican isolationism. On the debit side, although he himself alludes to the weakness\nof arguments that rely on \u2018straw men\u2019,10 such creatures also reside in the pages of his\narticle. As has been remarked of contemporary US foreign policy, Dunn\u2019s putative\nde-mythologising gives the appearance of a hammer looking rather desperately for\nnails to strike.\n6 Dunn, \u2018Isolationism Revisited\u2019, p. 244; Dumbrell, \u2018Varieties of Post-Cold War Isolationism\u2019, p. 24.\n7 Dumbrell, \u2018Varieties of Post-Cold War Isolationism\u2019, p. 25.\n8 Dunn, \u2018Isolationism Revisited\u2019, p. 247.\n9 Eric A.
