A wide variety of such patterns\nhave been observed from regular squares and hexagons to superlattice and quasipatterns and more\nexotic patterns such as oscillons.

Introduction. Waves on the surface of a \ufb02uid excited by a vertical oscillation\nwere \ufb01rst observed by Faraday [1]. Subsequently, in the 1980\u2019s, the so-called Faraday\ncrispation experiment became one of the \ufb01rst \ufb02uid experiments where mode interac-\ntions and chaos were observed [2]. Over the last decade, this experiment has become\na testbed for ideas of pattern selection in systems under parametric excitation, and\na large variety of patterns have been observed including not just regular patterns of\nsquares and hexagons but many more exotic patterns such as superlattice patterns,\nquasipatterns, and oscillons. These more recent studies were initiated by the results\nof Edwards and Fauve [3], who used a two-frequency, rather than a single-frequency,\nexcitation, thereby increasing the number of parameters in the problem and break-\ning the subharmonic time symmetry. Further two-frequency experiments have been\nperformed by Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub [4] and Arbell and Fineberg [5, 6, 7]. Subse-\nquently, many of the patterns have been observed in experiments with only a single\nfrequency of excitation [8]. Meanwhile, in practical applications of Faraday waves,\nthe phenomenon has been investigated as a tool to produce patterns on \ufb01lms [9, 10],\ninvestigated as a mechanism for transporting gas across an air\/water boundary [11],\nand seen as oscillations on the surface of bubbles [12].\nIn a container, if the amplitude of the vertical excitation is not too large, then no\nwaves form on the surface of the \ufb02uid and the \ufb02uid is merely translated up and down.\nAs the amplitude of the excitation is increased, waves appear at a critical amplitude\nof excitation. This onset of waves was \ufb01rst described theoretically by Benjamin and\n\u2217Received by the editors August 30, 2005; accepted for publication (in revised form) February 13,\n2007; published electronically May 10, 2007.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/67-4\/63922.html\n\u2020Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK (a.skeldon@surrey.\nac.uk).\n\u2021Department of Mathematics, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204-3008 (gio@math.uh.\nedu).

Kumar and Tuckerman [14] developed a method for solving\nthe linear stability problem for the viscous, \ufb01nite depth \ufb02uid problem for a single\nfrequency of excitation. This work was extended to two-frequency excitation [15] and\ngives excellent agreement with experimental measurements of the onset of patterns.\nUnderstanding not just the onset of patterns but the type of patterns is challeng-\ning. The full mathematical description of the \ufb02uid problem involves the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations in a domain with a free surface, and the excitation makes the problem\nnonautonomous. Symmetry arguments along with the notion of resonant trial inter-\nactions have been used to uncover some of the pattern selection mechanisms [18]. This\nshowed that weakly damped harmonic modes play a key role, with the wavenumber\nof the weakly damped mode relative to the critical wavenumber being an indicator of\nwhat patterns are likely to be seen. Since the wavenumbers of weakly damped modes\nare determined by the particular forcing function, this in turn has led to theoretical\nwork in the nearly Hamiltonian limit on controlling pattern selection [19, 20]. In this\nwork, they showed how multiple frequency components in the forcing can be used to\nenhance particular resonant triad interactions that in turn promote the stability of\nparticular superlattice patterns. The theoretical ideas in [18, 19, 20] were all tested\nby calculating the coe\ufb03cients of the relevant amplitude equations for a two-coupled\nscalar partial di\ufb00erential equation model derived and analyzed by Zhang and Vin\u02dcals\ndescribing the Faraday problem in a weakly viscous and large depth limit [16, 17].\nWhile the theory and the results calculated from the Zhang\u2013Vin\u02dcals equation agree\nwell, it is harder to establish to what degree these pattern selection mechanisms can\nbe used to explain experimental \ufb01ndings. This is because many of the experimental\nstudies use a \ufb02uid that is either moderately viscous or a container that is shallow,\nneither of which is within the range of validity of the Zhang\u2013Vin\u02dcals model. The reason\nthat experiments tend to focus on these cases is because of the presence of long wave-\nlength modes that can make it di\ufb03cult to observe regular patterns: these modes can\nbe damped either by increasing the viscosity or by increasing the dissipation from the\nlower boundary by making the container shallower [21]. The large viscosity also min-\nimizes the impact of the lateral boundaries on the patterns and the e\ufb00ect of patterns\nformed by meniscus waves emitted from the sidewalls.\nWeakly nonlinear analysis from the full \ufb02uid equations for single-frequency exci-\ntation in an in\ufb01nite \ufb02uid layer has been carried out by Chen and Vin\u02dcals [22]. In this\npaper, we extend the formulation of the weakly nonlinear problem to two-frequency\nexcitation and to \ufb01nite \ufb02uid depth. The former involves a signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent ap-\nproach to the derivation of a solvability condition: for a single frequency of excitation,\nthe form of the linear problem may be written as a recursion relation, and an adjoint\nto this recursion relation may be de\ufb01ned. This works because, in the linear Faraday\nproblem, modes with di\ufb00erent frequencies are coupled only through the excitation.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, a frequency component cos\u03c9t in the excitation couples the nth Fourier\nmode to the n\u2212 1 and the n+ 1 mode. When an N mode truncation is taken, then\nthe equation for the Nth mode is coupled only to the (N \u2212 1)th mode. Consequently,\none can solve for the Nth mode in terms of the (N \u2212 1)th mode. In turn, this then\nallows one to solve for the (N \u2212 1)th mode and, recursively, for all modes. If instead\nmultiple frequency forcing, for example, cos\u03c7 cosM1\u03c9t+sin\u03c7 cosM2\u03c9t, is used, then\nthe nth Fourier mode is coupled to four other modes, n\u2212M1, n\u2212M2, n+M1, n+M2.\nTruncating at N modes leaves the Nth mode coupled to both N \u2212M1 and N \u2212M2,\nand so a recursion relation cannot readily be de\ufb01ned.\nIn the future, we will investigate the e\ufb00ect of depth on the coe\ufb03cients of the\n1066 A. C. SKELDON AND G. GUIDOBONI\namplitude equations; however, for the purposes of this paper, we have focused on\ncarrying out the calculations and detailed results for in\ufb01nite depth only.\nThe pattern selection problem is further complicated by several issues. First,\nabove onset not just a single wavenumber but a band of wavenumbers is unsta-\nble. Allowing for variation of the spatial scale to account for this typically leads\nto Ginzburg\u2013Landau-type amplitude equations. Second, in the viscous Faraday prob-\nlem, there are weakly damped long wavelength modes. These are coupled to the free\nsurface deformation so that the larger the amplitude of the Faraday waves the more\nsigni\ufb01cant the e\ufb00ect. Both of these e\ufb00ects are discussed in [23] for Faraday waves in\ntwo space dimensions, but as yet there has been no attempt to include these e\ufb00ects in\nthree space dimensions. Note that since the weakly damped long wavelength modes\nare coupled to the surface deformation, they do not e\ufb00ect the pattern selection at\nonset but could have an e\ufb00ect thereafter. Finally, at onset the wavenumber speci\ufb01es\nthe magnitude but not the direction of the associated wavevector. The spatial scale\nis therefore determined but not the particular pattern. Typically, a \ufb01nite number\nof wavevectors are considered and amplitude equations derived for the amplitude as-\nsociated with each wavevector. Two approaches are taken. In the \ufb01rst, an integer\nnumber of eigenvectors corresponding to modes that are equispaced around a circle\nare considered. Depending on the number of modes used, this leads to an amplitude\nequation describing squares, hexagons, or quasipatterns. The amplitude equations are\nof gradient form, and a Lyapunov function can be written down. The relative stability\nof the di\ufb00erent patterns is then inferred from the relative value of the energy for the\ndi\ufb00erent states. A clear discussion of some of the issues involved in using amplitude\nequations to describe quasipatterns is given in [24]. Alternatively, eigenvectors that\ngenerate di\ufb00erent spatially periodic lattices are considered. Amplitude equations may\nagain be derived, but this time the eigenvalues indicating the relative stability for dif-\nferent patterns that are supported by the same lattice are considered. The methods\nare closely related, as discussed further in sections 4 and 6. In their single-frequency\nstudy, Chen and Vina\u02dcls [22] focus on squares, hexagons, and quasipatterns. Here in\nour two-frequency approach we, at least initially, consider spatially periodic patterns\non a lattice. We apply our results to the particular two-frequency experimental results\nof Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub [4] and \ufb01nd good agreement with their observations.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we set up the mathematical\nproblem. In section 3, a weakly nonlinear expansion about the critical wavenumber\nis carried out and the weakly nonlinear equations at each order derived. In section 4,\nwe brie\ufb02y discuss the pattern formation context within which we work and specify\nthe general form of the solutions in the horizontal direction. This leads to a sequence\nof problems for the surface height and the vertical dependence of the velocity. These\nequations are solved in section 5, leading to the evaluation of the coe\ufb03cients for the\namplitude equations describing the weakly nonlinear pattern formation. The problem\ncontains a number of physical parameters, and the coe\ufb03cients are calculated for a\nrange of values relevant to the experimental results in [4]. The calculations in section 5\nare performed only in the case of in\ufb01nite depth, although all early sections are not\nrestricted in this way. The justi\ufb01cation for this and the implications of the values of\nthe coe\ufb03cients for the pattern selection are discussed in section 6. Our conclusions\nare drawn in section 7.\n2. Mathematical model. We consider an in\ufb01nite horizontal layer of viscous\nincompressible \ufb02uid of \ufb01nite depth that is subjected to gravity g and to a vertical\nperiodic acceleration of amplitude a. At the lower boundary the \ufb02uid is in contact\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1067\nz=0\nz=\u2212h\/l\nz=\u03b6(x,y;t)\naf(t)\ng\nFig. 2.1.

A sketch of the geometry is shown\nin Figure 2.1. We suppose the free surface is regular enough to be written in the\nCartesian representation z = \u03b6(x, y; t); then the \ufb02uid motion is described by the\ndimensionless Navier\u2013Stokes equations\n\u2207 \u00b7 u = 0,\n\u2202tu+ u \u00b7 \u2207u = \u2212\u2207P + C\u0394u\u2212 (1 + af(t))e3,(2.1)\nwhere u = (u, v, w) is the velocity \ufb01eld, P the pressure, and\n(2.2) f(t) \u2261 f1(t) = cos(\u03c9t)\nfor single-frequency excitation and\n(2.3) f(t) = f2(t) = cos(\u03c7) cos(M1\u03c9t) + sin(\u03c7) cos(M2\u03c9t+ \u03c6)\nfor two-frequency excitation, where M1 and M2 are integers and \u03c7 and \u03c6 are real.\nThe units of length, time, velocity, and pressure have been taken as l,\n\u221a\nl\/g,\n\u221a\ngl,\nand \u0007gl, respectively. The amplitude of the acceleration due to the excitation, a, is\nmeasured in units of g. Here l is taken as k\u22121c , where kc is the wavenumber of the\npattern at onset. The parameter C = \u03bd\/(gl3)1\/2 is the square of the inverse of the\nGalileo number, where \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity of the \ufb02uid. We have used the\nnotation \u2207 = (\u2207H , \u2202z), with \u2207H = (\u2202x, \u2202y). Equations (2.1) apply in a domain\n\u03a9 = \u03a3 \u00d7 (\u2212h\/l, \u03b6(x, y; t)), where \u03a3 is the horizontal periodicity cell. The bottom of\nthe container, at z = \u2212h\/l, is rigid, and therefore we take no-slip boundary conditions\nhere:\n(2.4) u = v = w = 0.\nAt the free surface z = \u03b6(x, y; t) we have the kinematic condition, which says that the\nsurface is advected by the \ufb02uid, and two further conditions, one for the balance of\nthe tangential stresses and one for the balance of normal stresses. This leads to three\nconditions at z = \u03b6(x, y; t), namely\n\u2202t\u03b6 + u\u2202x\u03b6 + v\u2202y\u03b6 = w,\nt1 \u00b7Tn = t2 \u00b7Tn = 0,(2.5)\n\u2212P + 2CnD(u)n = BH\u2212 pe,\n1068 A.

The parameter B = \u03c3\/\u0007gl2, where \u03c3 is the surface tension and \u0007 the density of\nthe \ufb02uid, is the inverse Bond number and is a nondimensional measure of the relative\nimportance of surface tension and gravity.\nIt is convenient to de\ufb01ne a new pressure,\n(2.6) p = P + (1 + af(t))z,\nand this has the e\ufb00ect of shifting the acceleration term from the momentum equation\nto the normal stress condition. In addition, we eliminate the pressure from the mo-\nmentum equation by taking \u2212(\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7). Using the relation \u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7u = \u2207(\u2207\u00b7u)\u2212\u0394u\nand the fact that \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0, the problem then becomes\n\u2207 \u00b7 u = 0,\n\u2202t\u0394u\u2212 C\u0394\u0394u = \u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (u \u00b7 \u2207u),(2.7)\nwith boundary conditions on z = \u2212h\/l,\n(2.8) u = v = w = 0,\nand on z = \u03b6,\n\u2202t\u03b6 + u\u2202x\u03b6 + v\u2202y\u03b6 = w,\nt1 \u00b7Tn = t2 \u00b7Tn = 0,(2.9)\n2CnD(u)n = BH+ p\u2212 pe \u2212 (1 + af(t))\u03b6.\nEquations (2.7) with boundary conditions (2.8) and (2.9) have a trivial solution,\n(2.10) u = 0, p = pe, \u03b6 = 0.\nThis solution corresponds to a \ufb02at-surface state where there is no relative motion of\nthe \ufb02uid with respect to the moving frame.\n3. Weakly nonlinear analysis. The \ufb02at-surface state loses stability at a crit-\nical amplitude of the excitation frequency to regular patterns of standing waves. We\nuse a multiple timescale approach to derive equations describing the amplitude of\nthese standing waves near threshold. In order to do this, the governing equations and\nthe boundary conditions are expanded in a power series of the dimensionless distance\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1069\naway from the threshold, \u03b5, and solved order by order in \u03b5. So for the driving di-\nmensionless amplitude a, we let a = a0 + \u03b5a1 + \u03b5\n2a2 and expand the \ufb02ow variables\nas\nu = \u03b5u1 + \u03b5\n2u2 + \u03b5\n3u3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\np = pe + \u03b5p1 + \u03b5\n2p2 + \u03b5\n3p3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b6 = \u03b5\u03b61 + \u03b5\n2\u03b62 + \u03b5\n3\u03b63 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nAt each order in \u03b5 the solution is de\ufb01ned in a di\ufb00erent domain since each \u03b6i is di\ufb00erent.\nIn order to overcome this di\ufb03culty, Chen and Vina\u02dcls [22] take a Taylor expansion of\nthe boundary conditions at the free surface around the \ufb02at surface state z = 0, so that\nthey consider the solution in \u03a3\u00d7 [\u2212h\/l, 0] at each order. We follow the same approach\nhere. Near threshold, \u03b5\u0005 1, we separate fast and slow timescales: t = \u03c4+T1\/\u03b5+T2\/\u03b52\nsuch that \u2202t = \u2202\u03c4 +\u03b5\u2202T1 +\u03b5\n2\u2202T2 . The fast timescale is the timescale of the excitation,\nwhile the slower timescales describe the evolution of the amplitude of the patterns\nover many periods of the excitation. In sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, we list the problem\nfor each of the \ufb01rst three orders in \u03b5. These agree with those used in the computations\nof [22], although note that there is a typographical error in their paper for the normal\nstress boundary condition at third order. In section 3.4, we derive the linear adjoint\nproblem that is needed in order to \ufb01nd the solvability conditions that lead to the\namplitude equations. The general form for the solvability conditions themselves are\ngiven in section 3.5. As found in [14] for the linear problem, the linear operator on the\nleft-hand side of the hierarchy of problems for di\ufb00erent \u03b5 depends only on the vertical\nvelocity w and on the height of surface \u03b6.

Patterns. In order to proceed further, we need to \ufb01rst solve the linear prob-\nlem set out in section 3.1. However, in an unbounded horizontal domain, while the\nlinear problem predicts the onset of spatially periodic patterns at a given excita-\ntion frequency and excitation amplitude with a wavenumber kc, it does not uniquely\ndetermine the pattern that is produced. This is related to the fact that, in an un-\nbounded horizontal domain, the Faraday problem is isotropic so that no particular\ndirection is preferred: any wavevector with wavenumber kc would give an allowable\nsolution; for example, stripes with any orientation would be possible. Furthermore,\nwithin the linear problem, linear superposition of di\ufb00erent wavevectors with the crit-\nical wavenumber also give solutions. In this way, solutions such as squares, hexagons,\nsuperlattice patterns, and quasipatterns may be constructed by adding together stripe\nsolutions of the appropriate orientation. However, the fact that these are solutions\nto the linear problem does not guarantee their existence or stability for the nonlinear\nproblem. Indeed, only particular combinations of patterns are observed in experi-\nments. Here we consider patterns that are spatially periodic, and this is implicit in\nour choice of domain in sections 2 and 3.\nFor patterns that are spatially periodic in two space dimensions, previous work has\nused equivariant bifurcation theory to \ufb01nd the generic types of solutions that exist [25],\nthe generic amplitude equations that these patterns satisfy, and the stability of each\npattern in terms of the coe\ufb03cients of these amplitude equations [26]. For example,\non the family of lattices with hexagonal symmetry, the generic amplitude equations\nare\nz\u02d91 = \u03bbz1 + \rz\u00af2z\u00af3\n+(b1|z1|2 + b2|z2|2 + b2|z3|2 + b4|z4|2 + b5|z5|2 + b6|z6|2)z1 +O(|z|4),\nz\u02d92 = \u03bbz2 + \rz\u00af3z\u00af1\n+(b2|z1|2 + b1|z2|2 + b2|z3|2 + b6|z4|2 + b4|z5|2 + b5|z6|2)z2 +O(|z|4),\nz\u02d93 = \u03bbz3 + \rz\u00af1z\u00af2\n+(b2|z1|2 + b2|z2|2 + b1|z3|2 + b5|z4|2 + b6|z5|2 + b4|z6|2)z3 +O(|z|4),\nz\u02d94 = \u03bbz4 + \rz\u00af6z\u00af5(4.1)\n+(b4|z1|2 + b6|z2|2 + b5|z3|2 + b1|z4|2 + b2|z5|2 + b2|z6|2)z4 +O(|z|4),\nz\u02d95 = \u03bbz5 + \rz\u00af4z\u00af6\n+(b5|z1|2 + b4|z2|2 + b6|z3|2 + b2|z4|2 + b1|z5|2 + b2|z6|2)z5 +O(|z|4),\nz\u02d96 = \u03bbz6 + \rz\u00af5z\u00af4\n+(b6|z1|2 + b5|z2|2 + b4|z3|2 + b2|z4|2 + b2|z5|2 + b1|z6|2)z6 +O(|z|4),\nwhere the zi are complex amplitudes and \u03bb, \r, and bi are real. An example of one\nof the family of such lattices is shown in Figure 4.1, where Kih is the mode with\namplitude zi. Di\ufb00erent lattices correspond to di\ufb00erent choices for \u03b8. In terms of the\nFaraday problem considered in this paper, these equations arise by representing the\nhorizontal spatial dependence of the linear problem for the surface height \u03b61 and the\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1073\nK1h\nK2h\nK3h\nK5h\nK4h\nK6h\n\u03b8\nFig. 4.1.

A further pattern has been found\nto exist and bifurcate from the trivial solution as discussed in [27]. We have not\nincluded this in Table 4.1 since its eigenvalues are indistinguishable from those for\nsuperhexagons at cubic order. We refer to both the superhexagons and the patterns\ndiscussed in [27] as superlattice patterns.\nSimilar results exist for families of square lattices.\nPreviously, the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations have been calculated for\na long wavelength scalar partial di\ufb00erential equation describing a range of convec-\ntion problems [28], for Turing patterns [29], and more recently for the Zhang\u2013Vin\u02dcals\nmodel of the Faraday problem [18].

In Table 4.2, we list the di\ufb00erent planforms\nand the corresponding value of the Lyapunov function (4.3). The information given\nby the eigenvalues of the amplitude equations given in Table 4.1 and that given by\nthe energy of the di\ufb00erent states as given in Table 4.2 is complementary. Below we\ncalculate the coe\ufb03cients for the amplitude equations (4.1) from the full Navier\u2013Stokes\nequation formulation of the Faraday problem. We then calculate the eigenvalues to\nexamine relative stability. For those states that are relatively stable, we calculate the\nvalue of the Lyapunov function to \ufb01nd which have the lowest energy.\nThe coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations are found by focusing on three calcula-\ntions: one for stripes, one for rectangular patterns, and one for hexagons; these corre-\nspond to considering the three subspaces, z = (AS , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), z = (AR, 0, 0, AR, 0, 0),\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1075\nTable 4.2\nValue of the Lyapunov function F for each of the primary bifurcation branches on the hexagonal\nlattice; \u0002, b1, . . . , b6 are coe\ufb03cients in the bifurcation equation (4.1).

Focusing on a particular pattern means\nthat we make an assumption about the particular form of the horizontal behavior of\nthe \ufb02uid variables. We can use this to reformulate the weakly nonlinear analysis in\nsection 3 that is in terms of functions of x, y, and z to a simpler set of problems for\nsets of functions that depend only on z. It is this reformulation of the problem that\nis carried out in this section for each of the stripes, rectangles, and hexagons. Since\nstripes and rectangles arise through a symmetry-breaking bifurcation, there are no\nquadratic terms in the amplitude equations for these patterns. A result of this is that\nthe solvability condition at second order necessarily leads to a1 = 0. This fact can\nbe included from the beginning of the analysis, and then we need only scale on two\ntimescales; that is, we let t = \u03c4 + T\/\u03b52 so that \u2202t = \u2202\u03c4 + \u03b5\n2\u2202T . (The more general\nformulation on three timescales is needed for hexagons.)\nFor stripes, we consider a solution to the \ufb01rst order problem given in section 3.1\nof the form\nw1(x, z, \u03c4, T ) = AS(T )(e\nikx + e\u2212ikx)\n\u2211\nn\nW1,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\n\u03b61(x, \u03c4, T ) = AS(T )(e\nikx + e\u2212ikx)\n\u2211\nn\nZ1,ne\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\nand for rectangular patterns, we consider\nw1(x, y, z, \u03c4, T ) = AR(T )[e\nikx + eik(cx+sy) + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nW1,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\n\u03b61(x, y, \u03c4, T ) = AR(T )[e\nikx + eik(cx+sy) + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nZ1,ne\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,(4.4)\nwhere s = sin \u03b8 and c = cos \u03b8 and \u03b8 is the angle between the wavevectors that make\nup the rectangular pattern. Here k is the wavenumber of the pattern, and a Floquet\nexpansion in the basic frequency \u03c9 has been used as in [14]. When \u03b1 = 0, the expan-\nsion gives a harmonic solution, and when \u03b1 = \u03c9\/2, the expansion gives a subharmonic\n1076 A. C. SKELDON AND G. GUIDOBONI\nsolution. Here and below we sum from n = \u2212\u221e to n = +\u221e. Consequently, since\nboth the w1 and \u03b61 are real, we have in addition\nW1,n = W\u00af1,\u2212n, \u03b1 = 0,\nW1,n = W\u00af1,\u2212n\u22121, \u03b1 = \u03c9\/2.(4.5)\nAlthough we do not list them, there are analogous reality conditions for the velocity\ncomponents and surface height at each order. Similar choices for the expansion are\nmade for the behavior of the horizontal velocity components u1 and v1, and these are\nlisted in Appendix A. Since the results for stripes can be obtained by setting \u03b8 = 0\nand careful consideration of some factors of two, in what follows we include stripes as\na special case in our formulation of the problem for rectangles. In order to proceed,\nthe general form (4.4) for the pattern is substituted into the \ufb01rst order problem given\nin section 3.1. The result is a homogeneous fourth order linear di\ufb00erential equation\nfor the vertical dependence of the vertical velocity component W1,n(z) along with the\nappropriate boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = \u2212h\/l. This is given in section 4.1.\nAt second order, as for the \ufb01rst order problem, assuming that we are interested\nin particular patterns means that we know the form for the horizontal behavior of the\n\ufb02uid.

The expressions for the velocity components are substituted into the equations\nand boundary conditions at second order given in section 3.2, and this leads to an\ninhomogeneous fourth order ordinary di\ufb00erential equation for W2,i,n(z) along with\nboundary conditions. These are given in section 4.2.\nAs discussed above, if we take a1 = 0, then there is no solvability condition at\nsecond order for rectangles. However, at third order there is a solvability condition. In\norder to derive this, the general form for the adjoint problem is needed. In section 4.3,\nwe give the formulation for the adjoint problem, derived from the adjoint problem\ngiven in (3.8) along with the assumption that patterns to the adjoint problem take\nthe general form\nw\u2217(x, z, \u03c4, T ) = A\u2217(T )(eikx + e\u2212ikx)\n\u2211\nn\nW \u2217n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\n\u03b6\u2217(x, \u03c4, T ) = A\u2217(T )(eikx + e\u2212ikx)\n\u2211\nn\nZ\u2217ne\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 .\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1077\nThis then allows us to formulate the solvability condition at third order in section 4.4.\nThe result is an amplitude equation for rectangles whose coe\ufb03cients may be deter-\nmined from W1,n(z), Z1,n,W2,i,n(z), Z2,i,n and their derivatives along with the adjoint\neigenfunctions W \u22171,n(z) and Z\n\u2217\n1,n and their derivatives.\nIn the case of hexagons, we consider a \ufb01rst order solution of the form\nw1(x, y, z, \u03c4, T1, T2)\n= AH(T1, T2)[e\nikx + eik(\u2212x+\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + eik(\u2212x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nW1,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\n\u03b61(x, y, z, \u03c4, T1, T2)\n(4.7)\n= AH(T1, T2)[e\nikx + eik(\u2212x+\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + eik(\u2212x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nZ1,ne\ni(n\u03c9+\u03b1)\u03c4\nwith similar choices for u1 and v1 that are listed in Appendix A. This leads to the\nsame \ufb01rst order problem as for stripes and rectangles, as given in section 4.1 below.\nAt second order hexagons di\ufb00er from rectangles. Generically, in problems that\nhave E(2) symmetry, hexagons arise in a transcritical bifurcation and are necessar-\nily locally unstable. In the weakly nonlinear analysis, this appears as a quadratic\namplitude equation that results from the solvability condition for the second order\nproblem. Two cases of interest arise that can result in stable hexagonal solutions:\n\ufb01rst, when there is an extra symmetry in the problem that removes the quadratic\nterm, and second, when the coe\ufb03cient of the quadratic term is su\ufb03ciently small so\nthat the quadratic terms may formally be included at cubic order [30]. The Faraday\nproblem is an example of a system that has E(2) symmetry. As we shall see below,\nfor some values of the parameter \u03c7 in the drive (2.3), the response is subharmonic,\nand for some values it is harmonic. When the response is subharmonic, then there\nis an extra time symmetry in the problem and there are no quadratic terms in the\namplitude equations. When \u03c7 = 0, the response is harmonic, but since there is no M2\ncomponent in the drive, there is again an extra symmetry in the problem, and again\nthere are no quadratic terms in the amplitude equations. However, as the parameter\n\u03c7 is increased from 0, this extra symmetry is broken, and there is a gradual increase\nfrom zero in the size of the coe\ufb03cient of the quadratic term. There is therefore at\nleast some range in parameter space where it is reasonable to include the quadratic\nterms at cubic order. The way we proceed with the hexagon calculation is therefore\nas follows. First, we consider three timescales and formulate the solvability condition\nat second order. This is done using the solvability condition given in (3.9) and the\nspeci\ufb01c form for the hexagonal pattern at \ufb01rst order (4.7); the result is given in sec-\ntion 4.5. This gives us a quadratic amplitude equation and enables us to compute the\nsize of the quadratic term.\nNext, we make the assumption that the coe\ufb03cient of the quadratic term is either\nzero or su\ufb03ciently small (O(\u03b5)) so that we may formally include the terms at cubic\norder. We therefore set a1 = 0, rescale the problem on two timescales, and formulate\nthe problem for the solution at second order by taking as a general form for the second\norder problem\nw2(x, y, z, \u03c4, T ) = A\n2\nH [e\n2ikx + eik(\u2212x+\n\u221a\n3y) + eik(\u2212x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y) + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nW2,1,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4\n+A2H [e\nik\n\u221a\n3y + eik(3x+\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + eik(3x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nW2,2,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\n1078 A.

C. SKELDON AND G. GUIDOBONI\n5. Calculation of the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations. In sec-\ntion 4, we formulated a hierarchy of problems for the z dependence of the \ufb02uid pa-\nrameters. In this section, we outline how we solve this sequence of problems and\ncalculate the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations. We focus on the harmonic case,\n\u03b1 = 0, but the calculations for the subharmonic case are similar. We also note that\nusing the transformation \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9\/2, M1 \u2192 2M1, M2 \u2192 2M2, the subharmonic case\ncan be incorporated into the formulation for the harmonic problem. As explained\nin section 5.1, the calculations are substantially simpler in the speci\ufb01c case of an\nin\ufb01nite layer, and while we have solved the linear problem for both the \ufb01nite and\nin\ufb01nite cases, we have calculated the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations only for\nin\ufb01nite depth. We justify why this is a reasonable approximation for the speci\ufb01c \ufb02uid\nparameter choices we use when we discuss the results in section 6.\n5.1. Linear problem. The general solution for W1,n(z) that satis\ufb01es (4.9) is\nW1,0(z) = (a1,0 + zc1,0)e\nkz + (b1,0 + zd1,0)e\n\u2212kz,\nW1,n(z) = a1,ne\nkz + b1,ne\n\u2212kz + c1,neq1,nz + d1,ne\u2212q1,nz, n \t= 0,(5.1)\nwhere\nq21,n =\nin\u03c9\nC\n+ k2.\nApplying the boundary conditions allows values for the coe\ufb03cients a1,n, b1,n, c1,n,\nand d1,n to be found. However, the subsequent analysis is substantially easier in the\nparticular case of an in\ufb01nite layer, where the lower boundary conditions are replaced\nwith the requirement that the solution be bounded as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In this case, b1,n =\nd1,n = 0, and it is this case we discuss below.\nIn order to \ufb01nd a1,n and c1,n, they are expressed \ufb01rst in terms of Z1,n using the\nkinematic condition (4.11) and the tangential stress condition (4.12) to give\na1,0 = 0,\na1,n = (in\u03c9 + 2Ck\n2)Z1,n, n \t= 0,\nc1,0 = 0,(5.2)\nc1,n = \u22122Ck2Z1,n, n \t= 0.\nThen the normal stress condition (4.13) is used to eliminate W1,n to give\nk2\n(\nBk2 + 1\n)\nZ1,0 = \u22121\n2\na0k\n2Z1,f,0, n = 0,(5.3)[\nk(2Ck2 + in\u03c9)2 \u2212 4C2k4q1,n + k2\n(\nBk2 + 1\n)]\nZ1,n = \u22121\n2\na0k\n2Z1,f,n, n \t= 0.\nThis is a generalized eigenvalue problem for a0 of the form\nAZ = a0BZ,\nwhere Z = (Z1,0, Z1,1, . . . , Z1,N )\nT . This generalized eigenvalue problem is the same\nas that solved in [15]. The minimum real positive eigenvalue a0 gives the critical\namplitude of onset of patterns, and the corresponding eigenvector gives the values\nfor Z1,n. Hence W1,n can be found from (5.2) and (5.1). These calculations and\nthose that follow were carried out using MATLAB. For the majority of the harmonic\ncalculations, we take N = 20, and for the subharmonic calculations, we take N = 40.\nDoubling the number of modes typically changed the results by less than 0.2%.\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1083\n5.2. Linear adjoint problem. The general solution for the linear adjoint prob-\nlem (4.22) for a \ufb02uid of in\ufb01nite depth is\nW \u22170 (z) = (a\n\u2217\n0 + zc\n\u2217\n0)e\nkz,\nW \u2217n(z) = a\n\u2217\nne\nkz + c\u2217ne\nq\u2217nz, n \t= 0,\nwhere\nq\u2217n\n2 = \u2212 in\u03c9\nC\n+ k2.\nNote that q\u2217n is the complex conjugate of q1,n. This can be solved analytically in\nterms of Z\u2217n using the adjoint equivalents to the kinematic condition (4.23) and the\ntangential stress condition (4.24), and after some manipulation we \ufb01nd\nZ\u22170 = \u22122Ck3W \u22170 (0),\nZ\u2217n =\n1\nindn\u03c9\nW \u2217n(0), n \t= 0,(5.4)\nwhere\ndn =\n(\nk(2Ck2 \u2212 in\u03c9)2 \u2212 4C2k4q\u2217n\n)\u22121\n.\nSubstitution of these expressions for Z\u2217n into the normal stress condition (4.25) gives\nk2(Bk2 + 1)W \u22170 (0) = \u2212\n1\n2\na\u22170k\n2W \u2217f,0(0),(5.5)[\nk(2Ck2 \u2212 in\u03c9)2 \u2212 4C2k4q\u2217n + k2(Bk2 + 1)\n]\nW \u2217n(0) = \u2212\n1\n2\na\u22170k\n2W \u2217f,n(0), n \t= 0.\nThis results in a second generalized eigenvalue problem of the form\nA\u2217W\u2217 = a\u22170B\n\u2217W\u2217.\nAs expected, when we solve this, we \ufb01nd a0 = a\n\u2217\n0, and W\n\u2217\nn(0) is the complex conjugate\nof Z1,n.

Second order problem and solvability condition for hexagons. The\nlinear and linear adjoint problems for hexagons are the same as for stripes and rect-\nangles. Once Z1, W1, Z\n\u2217, and W \u2217 are known, the size of the quadratic coe\ufb03cient in\nthe amplitude equation for hexagons may be computed from (4.31). The calculations\nof the second order solution and solvability condition at third order then follow in a\nvery similar fashion to the calculation for rectangles: the same products appear but\nwith di\ufb00erent coe\ufb03cients.\n5.6. Evaluating the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations. In order to\ncompute the stability of the patterns as given in Table 4.1, we need to calculate each\nof the cubic coe\ufb03cients bi that appear in the generic amplitude equations (4.1) along\nwith the value of the quadratic coe\ufb03cient \r\u02dc. From the calculations for rectangles,\nstripes, and hexagons this may be done as follows. The solvability condition for\nrectangles and stripes takes the form given in (4.26), that is,\n(5.8) \u03b4\ndA\ndT\n= a2\u03b2A+ \u03b3A\n3.\nThe values of \u03b4 and \u03b2 are independent of the type of pattern considered, but the value\nof \u03b3 is not. By comparing the amplitude equations with the equations given for each\nstate given in Table 4.1, we see that when \u03b3 is computed in the case of stripes, it\ngives us the value for b1. If the solvability condition is calculated for rectangles, then\n\u03b3 gives us b1 + b4, and hence the value of b4 (and similarly b5 and b6) may be found.\nIn the case of hexagons, the solvability condition takes the form\n(5.9) \u03b4\n\u2202AH\n\u2202T\n= a2\u03b2AH + \u03b32A\n2\nH + (\u03b31 + \u03b33)A\n3\nH ,\nwhere \u03b4, \u03b2, and \u03b31 are the same as for stripes and \u03b32 is given by (4.31) and \u03b33\ncomes from (C.1). By comparing with the amplitude equation for hexagons given in\nTable 4.1, we see that \u03b33 gives the value of 2b2. Note that while b1 and b2 are \ufb01xed for a\ngiven set of \ufb02uid parameters, the values of b4, b5, and b6 depend on the lattice angle \u03b8.\nIn the results we present in the next section, we rescale the amplitude equations\nby letting A \n\u2192 \u221a|\u03b2\/b1|A, AH \n\u2192 \u221a|\u03b2\/b1|AH , and T \n\u2192 |\u03b4\/\u03b2| so that the cubic\ncoe\ufb03cient for stripes b1 in the rescaled equations is always \u00b11.\n1086 A.

Results. Here we present the results of our calculations for the particular\n\ufb02uid parameters used in the experimental results given in [4].\n6.1. Linear stability results. First, the generalized eigenvalue problem (5.3)\nis solved, and this gives the critical amplitude as a function of k. Typical curves are\nshown in Figure 6.1. These are analogous to those computed by Besson, Edwards, and\nTuckerman [15] but focus on the particular parameter values that are used by Kudrolli,\nPier, and Gollub [4], namely \u03c1 = 0.95cm\u22123, \u03bd = 20.9cS, and \u03c3 = 20.6dyn\/cm. Curves\nthat have a subharmonic response with the excitation are indicated with dotted lines,\nand those that are harmonic are marked with a solid line. The critical onset occurs\nat the minimum value of a, and this occurs at a critical wavenumber kc. For ease of\ncomparison with the experimental results, the curves are plotted in dimensional rather\nthan nondimensional units: with our choice of nondimensionalization, the value of kc\nis always 1. The minimum value point is indicated by a dot. The richness of the\ndynamics that is seen with two-frequency forcing is partly due to the fact that the\nparameter \u03c7 allows one to tune between the critical value for a occurring for either\na harmonic tongue, as is the case for 0\u25e6 < \u03c7 < 60\u25e6, or a subharmonic tongue, as\nis the case for 60\u25e6 < \u03c7 < 90\u25e6. There is a bicritical point that occurs when \u03c7 is\napproximately 60\u25e6. The phase \u03c6 has little impact on the position of the minimum\nvalue of the lowest tongue and therefore in the position of the bicritical point (changes\nin the position of the mimima are typically less than 0.001%). The phase does,\nhowever, alter the position of the tongues for some of the other harmonics.\nExperimentally, it is the onset of patterns as a function of \u03c7 that is observed rather\nthan the linear stability curves directly. In Figure 6.2, we show how the minimum\nof the linear stability curves varies with the relative importance of the amplitude of\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1087\n0 2 4 6 80\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\na cos \u03c7\na\n s\nin\n \u03c7\nFlat\n(a)\n0 5 100\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\na cos \u03c7\na\n s\nin\n \u03c7\nFlat\n(b)\nFig. 6.2.

Two cases are\nshown: Figure 6.2(a) is for the same parameter values as for Figure 6.1. Figure 6.2(b)\nis for the same \ufb02uid parameters but di\ufb00erent excitation parameters. These two cases\ncorrespond to the two cases considered in detail in Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub, and the\nlinear stability boundaries compare well with the corresponding experimental results\nshown in Figures 1 and 6 of their paper [4]. The bicritical point occurs for \u03c7 = 63.4\nin the case (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and \u03c7 = 61.8 when (M1,M2) = (6, 7). These compare\nwell with the value quoted by Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub of \u03c7 = 61.5.\nAs discussed in the introduction, high viscosity or shallow depth are used to damp\nmodes with a small wavenumber that can make regular patterns hard to observe. The\n\ufb02uid used by Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub was of moderate viscosity (C \u2248 0.4 rather\nthan C \u0005 1). How \u201cshallow\u201d a container is depends on the product kch, in particular\nwhether e\u2212kch is negligible when compared with ekch. For the Kudrolli\u2013Pier\u2013Gollub\nexperiments, h = 0.3cm, giving kc \u2248 14 and e\u2212kch\/ekch \u2248 0.0002. In the weakly\nnonlinear calculations, we shall see that it is not just the main harmonic tongue that\nis of importance but the weakly damped harmonic tongue that has a minimum at\nk \u2248 6cm\u22121. For this tongue, e\u2212kch\/ekch \u2248 0.03. Since this is also small, we believe\nthat an in\ufb01nite depth approximation is reasonable. Consequently, in the nonlinear\nresults that we present below, the calculations are performed only for in\ufb01nite depth.\n6.2. Single-frequency results (\u03c7 = 0\u25e6 and \u03c7 = 90\u25e6). The two-frequency\nexcitation term we are interested in is of the form\nf(t) = f2(t) = cos(\u03c7) cos(M1\u03c9t) + sin(\u03c7) cos(M2\u03c9t+ \u03c6).\nWhen \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 or 90\u25e6, this reduces to a single-frequency excitation. When \u03c7 = 0\u25e6, this\ncorresponds to a pure M1 excitation, and when \u03c7 = 90\n\u25e6, this is a pure M2 excitation.\n1088 A. C. SKELDON AND G.

For (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 the value of the coe\ufb03cient b4 as a function of the\nlattice angle \u03b8.\nSince the two cases we consider have M1 even and M2 odd, the pure M1 response is\nharmonic and the pure M2 response is subharmonic. In each case, the overall picture\nis similar. The quadratic term in the amplitude equations is zero and we \ufb01nd the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 All the eigenvalues for hexagons given in Table 4.1 are negative for all values\nof the lattice angle \u03b8. This suggests that hexagons are a stable state.\n\u2022 Stripes and superlattice patterns have at least one unstable eigenvalue.\n\u2022 Rectangular patterns are stable, on the lattice on which they occur, if they\nare \u201csu\ufb03ciently square.\u201d\nThis last point may be seen by considering the eigenvalues of the family of rectangles\nRh1,m,n listed in Table 4.1. The eigenvalues b1 + b4, \u03bc1, and \u03bc2 are all negative. The\nremaining eigenvalue, b1\u2212b4, is negative only if the lattice angle \u03b8 is su\ufb03ciently large.\nIn the case (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and \u03c7 = 0\n\u25e6 in Figure 6.3, we plot the scaled value of b4\nas a function of the lattice angle \u03b8. Since in the scaled units b1 = \u22121, b1\u2212 b4 < 0 only\nif \u03b8 > 52\u25e6. The aspect ratio of the rectangles is given by\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 cos \u03b8)\/(1 + cos \u03b8) so\nthat stability for rectangles with \u03b8 > 52\u25e6 means that rectangles with an aspect ratio\nbetween 0.48 and 1 are stable (on the lattice on which they occur).\nBy considering the eigenvalues on spatially periodic lattices alone, we \ufb01nd that\nboth hexagons and rectangles are possible stable states. If we \ufb01nd the values of the\nLyapunov function F (see Table 4.2) for hexagons and rectangles, then we \ufb01nd that\nthose rectangles with an aspect ratio closest to 1 have the lowest value.\nThe results are similar for the three other single frequency cases that are relevant\nto the bifurcation sets shown in Figure 6.2, namely (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and \u03c7 = 90\n\u25e6\nand (M1,M2) = (6, 7) and \u03c7 = 0\n\u25e6 or \u03c7 = 90\u25e6. The conclusion is that the calculations\nfor solutions on periodic lattices show that stripe patterns are unstable. Hexagons\nand \u201csu\ufb03ciently square\u201d rectangular patterns are relatively stable states with square\npatterns having the lowest value of the Lyapunov function. This suggests that square\npatterns will be observed at the points where \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 and \u03c7 = 90\u25e6.

(b) The value of the\ncoe\ufb03cient b4 + b5 + b6 compared with b1 + 2b2 as a function of the lattice angle \u03b8. Just as b4 has a\nsingularity at 60\u25e6, b5 has a singularity at 0\u25e6, and so the region around 0\u25e6 has been excluded.\npatterns will be harmonic when \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 and subharmonic when \u03c7 = 90\u25e6. This agrees\nwith the experimental \ufb01ndings of Kudrolli, Pier, and Gollub.\nNote that if we use the same parameter values as used by Chen and Vin\u02dcals in [22]\nin their single-frequency study, then we get excellent agreement with their work.\n6.3. Two-frequency results (0 < \u03c7 < 90\u25e6). For two-frequency excitation,\nwe have performed a systematic study of the coe\ufb03cients \r\u02dc, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, and b6\nas a function of \u03c7 and the lattice angle \u03b8 for the same \ufb02uid parameters as used above\nand for the two cases (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and (M1,M2) = (6, 7). In the \ufb01rst case, most\nresults are presented for \u03c6 = 16\u25e6 and in the second case for \u03c6 = 20\u25e6: these are the\nvalues for which the majority of the results in [4] are presented. We focus on the onset\nof harmonic patterns since along the subharmonic branch squares the absence of the\nquadratic term means that hexagons and rectangles remain the only stable states,\nwith squares having the lowest energy.\nFrom the values of the coe\ufb03cients we have computed the stability of the di\ufb00erent\nplanforms based on the eigenvalues for each state given in Table 4.1 as a function of\nthe lattice angle. If the eigenvalues indicate that the state is relatively stable, then\nwe compute the value of the Lyapunov function, as given in Table 4.2.\nWhen \u03c7 is zero, b4 increases monotonically with \u03b8, as shown in Figure 6.3. How-\never, this changes as \u03c7 is increased and peaks develop. In Figure 6.4(a), we plot b4(\u03b8)\nfor (M1,M2) = (4, 5) and for \u03c7 = 60\n\u25e6, \u03c6 = 16\u25e6. The angle \u03b8 = 60\u25e6 has been ex-\ncluded because this corresponds to the quadratic resonance point, and the calculation\nfor rectangles breaks down here. From Table 4.1 it can be seen that for superlattice\npatterns to become stable, one needs b4 + b5 + b6 \u2212 b1 \u2212 2b2 > 0. This same quantity\ncauses the destabilization of hexagons. In Figure 6.4(b), we plot b4 + b5 + b6 along\nwith b1+2b2. For most values of \u03b8, and so on most lattices, b4+b5+b6\u2212b1\u22122b2 < 0,\nand superlattice patterns are unstable. However, the peak in b4(\u03b8) at 31.8\n\u25e6 leads to\na small region centered at 30\u25e6 for which b4 + b5 + b6 \u2212 b1 \u2212 2b2 > 0, and it is possible\nfor superlattice patterns to be stable.\nThe corresponding graphs of b4 and b4 + b5 + b6 for (M1,M2) = (6, 7) are\n1090 A.

In this case, there is a peak in b4 at 21.2\n\u25e6, and this leads\nto a peak in b4 + b5 + b6 with a maximum at 21.2\n\u25e6. Note that even at \u03c7 = 60\u25e6,\nb4 + b5 + b6 \u2212 b1 \u2212 2b2 < 0, and all superlattice patterns are unstable. It is only once,\n\u03c7 > 61\u25e6, that stable superlattice patterns occur, the \ufb01rst to stabilize being those that\noccur on a lattice with lattice angle \u03b8 = 21.2\u25e6.\nWe have shown for \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 that both hexagons and rectangles may be stable with\nrectangles having the lowest value of the Lyapunov function. Figure 6.4 suggests that\nin the case (M1,M2) = (4, 5), stable superlattice patterns may occur for \u03c7 = 60\n\u25e6. In\nFigure 6.6(a), we show a bifurcation set that summarizes the regions where di\ufb00erent\nstates are stable for the \u03bb, \u03c7 plane. Note that hexagons are a planform that exists on\nall the hexagonal lattices and so that where hexagons are shown as stable they are\nstable to perturbations on all hexagonal lattices. Where they are unstable, there is\nat least one lattice on which they are unstable. The peak in b4(\u03b8) at 30\n\u25e6 means that\nthe maximal region of instability for hexagons occurs as \u03b8h \u2192 30\u25e6. For rectangles\nand superlattices, the story is more complicated. Di\ufb00erent lattices support di\ufb00erent\nsuperlattice patterns and di\ufb00erent rectangles. Since it is on lattices with \u03b8 \u2192 30\u25e6 that\nhexagons become unstable \ufb01rst (and superlattices onset \ufb01rst), we plot the regions for\nthe stability of rectangles and superlattice patterns for the speci\ufb01c case \u03b8 = 30\u25e6.\nAt the actual value of \u03b8 = 30\u25e6 the center manifold reduction that leads to the\namplitude equations is not formally valid, as discussed in [24], and the \u201csuperlattice\npatterns\u201d are in fact quasipatterns. However, in practical terms, there is little real\ndi\ufb00erence between taking a periodic lattice that has a lattice angle close to 30\u25e6 and\ntaking 30\u25e6 itself: although on the periodic lattice the amplitude equations may be\nformally justi\ufb01ed, the spectral gap between critical and noncritical eigenvalues will\nbe small, and thus the formal region of validity for the center manifold is likely\nto be small. Visually, it is impossible to distinguish between a quasipattern and a\nsuperlattice pattern with a very large lengthscale. Similarly, the regions of stability\nwould be indistinguishable whether we took \u03b8 = 30\u25e6 or a value of \u03b8 close to 30\u25e6 that\nresults in a spatially periodic lattice.\nAs shown in Figure 6.6(a), for most values of \u03bb and \u03c7, there is bistability where\nmore than one pattern is stable.

Light grey: rectangles.\npatterns has the lowest value of the Lyapunov function. What we \ufb01nd is that, for\nsmall values of \u03c7, rectangles and hexagons are both stable, with rectangles being\nthe most stable state. Note that it is the Rh3,m,n rectangles that are stable, and as\n\u03b8 \u2192 30\u25e6, the aspect ratio of these particular rectangles tends to 1. As \u03c7 increases, the\nvalue of \r\u02dc increases from zero, and this results in the destabilization of the rectangles\nso that hexagons become the preferred state at onset. Near the bicritical point,\nhexagons are themselves destabilized to superlattice patterns, and there are regions\nwhere superlattice patterns are the only stable state. A typical bifurcation diagram\nfor (M1,M2) = (4, 5) at \u03c7 = 60\n\u25e6 is shown in Figure 6.7. Note that the values of\n\r\u02dc are small so that higher order correction terms for the position of the secondary\nbifurcation points are unlikely to a\ufb00ect the overall qualitative bifurcation sequence.\nThe analogous bifurcation set and energy diagram for the case (M1,M2) = (6, 7)\nare shown in Figure 6.8. In this case, the lattice angle \u03b8 = 21.2\u25e6 has been used since in\nthe case (6, 7), it is on this lattice that hexagons are destabilized \ufb01rst. On this lattice,\nthe stable rectangles have aspect ratio 0.86. The overall picture is similar to that for\n(4, 5) but with the transitions from rectangle to hexagon and hexagon to superlattice\npattern occurring for larger values of \u03c7.\nFigures 6.6 and 6.8 compare well with the experimental results of Kudrolli, Pier,\nand Gollub. As is suggested by our results, they \ufb01nd that rectangles are stable for low\nvalues of \u03c7 giving way to hexagons as \u03c7 is increased. As for our theoretical results,\nthe transition from rectangles to hexagons occurs for higher values of \u03c7 in the (6, 7)\ncase than in the (4, 5) case. In both cases, there are superlattice\/quasipatterns near\nthe bicritical point.\nKudrolli, Pier, and Gollub also investigated the dependence of their results on the\n1092 A. C. SKELDON AND G.

We cannot hope to capture this latter transition in our study\nsince these patterns are time periodic and our amplitude equations have a gradient\nstructure. A theoretical explanation for these patterns was given in [31]. Nevertheless,\nwe illustrate how the phase does e\ufb00ect our results in Figure 6.9 for (4, 5) and \u03c7 = 61\u25e6.\nFirst, in Figure 6.9(a), the quantities b1 + 2b2 and b4 + b5 + b6 are shown. These\nare \u03c0\/2 periodic functions of \u03c6. The consequence is that the regions of stability\nof di\ufb00erent patterns depend on \u03c6, as shown by the bifurcation set in Figure 6.9(b)\nand the corresponding plot of the Lyapunov function in Figure 6.9(c) for the angle\n\u03b8 = 30\u25e6. These show that it is for phases close to 16\u25e6 that stable superlattice patterns\noccur closest to onset. We also \ufb01nd values of the phase for which there are no stable\nspatially periodic pattern near onset (the white wedge region in Figure 6.9).\nOverall, the results of Figures 6.4 through 6.8 show that the cases (M1,M2) =\n(4, 5) and (M1,M2) = (6, 7) are broadly similar. The experimental results show sim-\nilar bifurcation sequences in both cases but very di\ufb00erent forms for the planforms:\nin the case (6, 7), superlattice patterns are observed with an easily visible regular\nperiodic structure with two wavelengths. In [4], these are referred to as superlattice-I\npatterns. In the (4, 5) case, quasipatterns are observed. The key di\ufb00erence in the two\ncases is the lattice angle for which stable superlattice patterns are possible. In [18], it\nwas argued that the stabilization of the superlattice-I patterns followed from a reso-\nnant triad formed by the harmonic tongue with one of the weakly damped harmonic\ntongues. This was supported by a peak in the value of the rhombic coe\ufb03cient (b4\nhere) at around 22\u25e6 for the Zhang\u2013Vina\u02dcls model. In Figures 6.5 and 6.8, we have seen\nthat the same mechanism operates in the full Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Furthermore,\nit is the same fundamental mechanism that is at play in the (4, 5) case, as shown in\nFigures 6.4 and 6.6, where now it is a peak in b4 at 32.8\n\u25e6 which is signi\ufb01cant. This\npeak can again be traced to a resonant triad between the main harmonic mode and\nthe \ufb01rst (that is, smallest k) weakly damped harmonic mode. The consequence is\nthat while the analysis for the (6, 7) case suggests that a superlattice pattern with\nangle close to 21.2\u25e6, such as that shown in Figure 6.10(a), will occur, for the (4, 5)\ncase a superlattice pattern\/quasipattern with angle close to 30\u25e6, such as that shown\nin Figure 6.10(b), will occur.\n1094 A. C. SKELDON AND G. GUIDOBONI\nFig. 6.10. Typical superlattice patterns. Superlattice patterns have the form z =\n(ASH , ASH , ASH , ASH , ASH , ASH); the associated planform has the form ASH(cos(K1h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)+\ncos(K2h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)+ cos(K3h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)+ cos(K4h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)+ cos(K5h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)+ cos(K6h \u00b7 r+\u03c8)), where\nr = (x, y). (a) For \u03b8 \u2248 21.2\u25e6, \u03c8 = 2\u03c0\/3. (b) For \u03b8 \u2248 30\u25e6, \u03c8 = 0. The superlattice pattern for \u03c8 = 0\nhas a hexagonal rather than a triangular symmetry. Of these two states, only one is stable, but which\none is not determined at cubic order. The experimental patterns for the (6, 7) case clearly show a\ntriangular structure, and it was this that motivated the theoretical work of [27] on the \u03c8 = 2\u03c0\/3\nsuperlattice pattern.\nNote that there is a peak in the value of the coe\ufb03cient b4 for values of \u03c7 far\nfrom the bicritical point. For example, there is still a distinct peak in b4 at approx-\nimately 21\u25e6 for \u03c7 = 30\u25e6 in the (4, 5) case. This can be related to the fact that\nthe weakly damped harmonic tongue involved in the triad resonance is still promi-\nnent, as seen in Figure 6.1(c). However, it is only near the bicritical point that\nb4 + b5 + b6 \u2212 b1 \u2212 2b2 becomes positive, allowing superlattice patterns to stabilize.\n7. Conclusion. In this paper, we have derived the form of the weakly nonlinear\nproblem for a \ufb01nite depth of \ufb02uid that is subject to a vertical oscillation from the full\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations. Using the ideas of symmetry for patterns that tessellate the\nplane, we have found the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations and calculated the\nconsequences for stability of di\ufb00erent spatially periodic patterns in the in\ufb01nite depth\ncase. We have focused on the particular parameters that were used in experimental\nresults presented in [4]. Good agreement has been found between the predictions of\nthe weakly nonlinear analysis and the experimental results, without the use of any\n\ufb01tted parameters.\nIn the future, there are many interesting questions relating to regular patterns in\nthe Faraday problem that we plan to use our method to explore. Our current code will\nallow us to perform a careful comparison between the Zhang\u2013Vin\u02dcals equations and the\nfull Navier\u2013Stokes equations for varying viscosity. We will also be able to investigate\nhow the coe\ufb03cients of the amplitude equations scale with the di\ufb00erent parameters and\ncompare with the scaling arguments given in [20] for multiple frequency forcing. This\nwill enable us to see the degree to which the arguments for the control of patterns\nthrough multiple frequency in the weak viscosity case carry over to moderate and\nlarge viscosity. (With our formulation, it is straightforward to include more than two\nfrequency components.)\nThe solvability condition is valid for both \ufb01nite and in\ufb01nite depth, although our\nsubsequent calculations were carried out only for in\ufb01nite depth. Our future plans also\ninclude coding up the \ufb01nite depth case. This will allow us to explore how the coef-\nPATTERN SELECTION FOR FARADAY WAVES 1095\n\ufb01cients vary with depth and enable comparison with experimental results in shallow\ncontainers to be made.\nMeanwhile, the Faraday wave experiment continues to be a rich source for striking\nand intriguing patterns, as shown by the recent results of Epstein and Fineberg [32].\nAppendix A.

We take the\npressure as the sum of two terms:\n\u2202zp2 = \u2202z p\u02c62 + \u2202z p\u02dc2,\nwhere p\u02c6z solves\n(D.6) \u2202z p\u02c62 = \u2212\u2202\u03c4w2 + C\u0394w2 \u2212 u1 \u00b7 \u2207w1,\nwhile p\u02dcz = \u2212\u2202T1w1. We take p\u02c6z in the form of a hexagonal pattern:\n\u2202z p\u02c62 = A\n2\nH [e\nikx + eik(\u2212x+\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + eik(\u2212x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nDP2,0,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4\n+A2H [e\n2ikx + eik(\u2212x+\n\u221a\n3y) + eik(\u2212x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y) + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nDP2,1,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4\n+A2H [e\nik\n\u221a\n3y + eik(3x+\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + eik(3x\u2212\n\u221a\n3y)\/2 + c.c.]\n\u2211\nn\nDP2,2,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4\n+A2H\n\u2211\nn\nDP2,3,n(z)e\ni(n\u03c9+2\u03b1)\u03c4 ,\nwhere\nDP2,0,n(z) = \u22123\n\u2211\n(l+m=n)\nW1,l(z)DW1,m(z),\nDP2,1,n(z) = [\u2212i(n\u03c9 + 2\u03b1) + C(D2 \u2212 4k2)]W2,1,n(z),\nDP2,2,n(z) = [\u2212i(n\u03c9 + 2\u03b1) + C(D2 \u2212 3k2)]W2,2,n(z)\n\u2212\n\u2211\n(l+m=n)\nW1,l(z)DW1,m(z),\nDP2,3,n(z) = \u221212\n\u2211\n(l+m=n)\nW1,l(z)DW1,m(z).\nAcknowledgments.
