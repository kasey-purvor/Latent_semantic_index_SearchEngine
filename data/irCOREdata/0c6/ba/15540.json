Despite\nthe lack of active volcanism, the British Isles have\nbeen a key centre for the study of igneous rocks ever\nsince ancient lava flows and excavated igneous centres\nwere recognized there in the 18th century (Hutton,\n1788). This led to some of the earliest detailed studies\nof petrology. The starting point for many of these\nstudies was the British Palaeogene Igneous Province\n(BPIP; formerly known as the \u2018British Tertiary\u2019 (Judd,\n1889), and still recognized by this name by many\ngeologists around the globe). This collection of lavas,\nvolcanic centres and sill\/dyke swarms covers much\nof the west of Scotland and the Antrim plateau of\nNorthern Ireland, and together with similar rocks in the\nFaroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland forms a world-\nclass Large Igneous Province. This North Atlantic\nIgneous Province (NAIP) began to form through\ncontinental rifting above a mantle plume at c. 60 Ma,\nand subsequently evolved as North America separated\nfrom Europe, creating the North Atlantic Ocean.\nDuring a recent field workshop entitled \u2018Golden\nRum\u2019 (see Goodenough et al. 2008), as part of the\nbicentenary celebrations of the Geological Society of\nLondon, some 30 earth scientists gathered for a field\nworkshop held on the isles of Rum and Skye. Field\ntrips visited some classic igneous localities, celebrating\nthe work of many great geoscientists past and present.\nTalks were presented at the Aros Centre on the Isle\nof Skye, outlining some of the current research on the\nprovince, and highlighting some exciting new results.\nThis collection of papers is derived from talks presented\nduring that meeting and represents a snapshot of some\nof the current areas of interest in the NAIP, focusing\nparticularly on the British Palaeogene. Clearly this is\nnot an all-encompassing volume covering every area of\nresearch, but it provides a look at the depth and breadth\nof modern studies in the NAIP, which build on the\n\u2217Author for correspondence: D.A.Jerram@durham.ac.uk\nsolid foundations of over two centuries of work in the\nregion.\n1. The bigger picture \u2013 the British Palaeogene and\nNorth Atlantic Igneous Provinces\nThe North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) is a\nclassic Large Igneous Province (LIP), and research\nin this area has fuelled debates on such issues as\nthe origins of large outpourings of flood basalts, the\nrelationships of the intrusive and extrusive parts of\nigneous centres, the timescales of magmatism, and\nthe presence or absence of mantle plumes. The NAIP\nis not only laterally extensive (over thousands of\nkilometres), but formed over a somewhat protracted\nperiod of time when compared to some other LIPs.\nAs such, it can be an informative area to test our\nunderstanding of the formation of such provinces,\nthrough continental rifting and possible mantle plume\ninvolvement. Hansen et al. (this volume) provide a\nreview which considers the formation of the NAIP\nin the context of global plate reorganizations, and\nlithospheric extension across old orogenic fronts and\nsuture zones. They show that magmatism in the NAIP\nwas controlled by a combination of the underlying\ncomplex tectonic picture, and mantle processes such\nas local or regional scale upwellings prior to and\nduring the Early Eocene rifting. This approach may\nhelp to explain the presence of more localized igneous\ncentre components of the NAIP, as well as the rather\nheterogenous distribution of igneous products over a\nlarge but geographically constrained area.\nThe formation of such a complex construction of\nigneous centres and associated flood basalts over a\nprotracted time period (c. 62\u201354 Ma, e.g. Saunders\net al. 1997; Jerram & Widdowson, 2005) provides a\nlarge amount of material to be eroded. Brown, Holohan\n& Bell (this volume) focus on this somewhat poorly\nstudied part of the province\u2019s evolution. They review the\nerosion of the igneous centres and associated lava fields\nof the BPIP, and identify the sedimentary responses to\nfour broadly chronological stages in the history of the\n306 D. A. JERRAM, K. M. GOODENOUGH & V. R. TROLL\nBPIP volcanoes: the development of the lava fields;\nearly intrusion-induced uplift; caldera collapse; and\npost-volcano denudation and exhumation of central\ncomplexes. The dynamic landscape that developed\nduring these times consisted of alluvial fans, braided\nrivers, lakes and swamps. Into these environments, and\nduring key stages in the development of the igneous\ncentres, large volcanoes provided material through\ncatastrophic mass wasting and\/or caldera collapse\nevents.\nAnother noteworthy area of research in the NAIP\nstems from a different driving factor: exploration of\noffshore regions where flood basalts cover sedimentary\nbasins that may contain recoverable hydrocarbons.\nOffshore areas beneath flood basalt cover are no-\ntoriously difficult to image and therefore increased\nunderstanding of the internal architecture of the flood\nbasalt sequences may assist in dealing with the \u2018sub-\nbasalt imaging\u2019 problem, as well as providing valuable\ninformation fromwhich good models and strategies for\nexploration can be tested. The contribution from Jerram\net al. (this volume) looks at the internal architecture\nof the offshore region of the Faroe\u2013Shetland basin\nto understand the volcanic facies there. Onshore\nanalogues for known volcanic facies such as tubular\nflows, compound flows and hyaloclastites, which are\npreserved in onshore settings such as the Faroe Islands,\ncan be used to interpret the internal structure of the\noffshore lava sequence. The mapping of these facies\ntypes provides information about significant seaways\nthat were present around the onset of flood volcanism\nin the Faroe\u2013Shetland basin, and when reasonable\nvelocity models and gravity data are combined, better-\nconstrained models for the sub-basalt geology can be\nproduced.\n2. A classic closer view \u2013 understanding the igneous\ncentres\nFocusing in a little, the NAIP (and in particular the\nBritish part) is famous for its well-exposed lava fields\nand igneous centres (e.g. Emeleus & Bell, 2005).\nSignificant recent research has concentrated on the\ngreat natural laboratory of the Isle of Rum (Emeleus,\n1997), and the other contributions in this issue discuss\nrecent work in the Rum Central Complex, using the\nlatest ideas and techniques to revisit its classic layered\nintrusion and associated pyroclastic deposits.\nNicoll et al. (this volume) have studied the episode\nof early and voluminous felsic magmatism which\npreceded the formation of the mafic and ultramafic\nlayered suite in the Rum Central Complex. This\nmagmatic phase, which was associated with caldera\nformation, comprises a range of volcaniclastic breccias,\nfelsic intrusives, and ignimbrites and tuffs produced\nby explosive eruptions. The felsic magmas are largely\nthe product of crustal melting (Troll, Donaldson\n& Emeleus, 2004; Meyer et al. this volume) but\nthere is little direct evidence of the earliest stage\nof anatexis, and even less is known about the heat\nsource that would have been required to melt enough\ncrust to produce such a large amount of felsic\nmagma. Nicoll et al. present evidence for early mafic\nintrusions that triggered anatexis and the large-scale\ngeneration of felsic magmas, which ultimately led to\nexplosive felsic volcanism on Rum. They describe the\nenigmatic and distinctive Am Ma`m intrusion breccia,\nrevise its emplacement history and demonstrate that\nit contains entrained clasts of country rock, early\ngabbro and peridotite, which record a pre-caldera\nepisode of contact metamorphism and anatexis at\ndepth. These findings provide a unique record of early\nanatectic processes and the mafic magmas originally\nresponsible for driving felsic magmatism on Rum,\npossibly providing a key to investigating the origin of\nfelsic melts elsewhere in the North Atlantic Igneous\nProvince.\nMeyer et al. (this volume) build on the work of\nNicoll et al. (this volume), using geochemical and\nisotopic data to study the petrogenesis of the rhyodacitic\nand dacitic rocks of the early magmatic phase in the\nRum Central Complex. They show that the rhyodacites\nappear to be formed by large degrees of melting\nof Lewisian amphibolite-facies gneiss, whereas the\ndacitic volcanic rocks and the early gabbros are\nmixtures of crustal melts and primary mantle-derived\nmagmas. Late-stage picrites are considered to be close\nanalogues for the primitive mantle-derived melts that\ncaused crustal anatexis and for the parental magma\nof the Layered Suite. The rhyodacites have noticeably\nlower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, lower Rb and especially lower\nCs concentrations than would be expected for partial\nmelts from Lewisian amphibolite gneisses that crop out\nas uplifted blocks and inclusions in the Rum Central\nComplex. These findings are interpreted as indications\nfor a Cs\u2013Rb depletion event that affected the actual\namphibolite-facies parent rocks at mid-crustal depths\nprior to the Palaeogene, possibly during the Caledonian\norogeny.\nAlthough high-grade granulite-facies crustal rocks\nare generally considered to be present beneath Rum,\nsignificant contamination from this source has not\nbeen recognized either in the felsic magmas (Meyer\net al. this volume) or in the parent magmas of the\nultrabasic Layered Suite (Palacz & Tait, 1985). The\nprocesses by which mantle-derived magmas interacted\nwith continental crust under the Isle of Rum must have\ndiffered from those operating under the Isle of Skye,\nwhere granulite-facies gneiss appears to have been an\nimportant crustal contaminant in the lavas (Font et al.\n2008).\nHolohan et al. (this volume) have studied the\nphysical volcanology of the early magmatic phase on\nRum. Although it was long thought that the evolution\nof collapse caldera volcanoes begins with a large-\nmagnitude uplift (\u2018tumescence\u2019) of country rocks upon\ninitial intrusion of a large pre-caldera magma body,\nevidence for such pre-collapse uplift has been elusive\nor absent in recent surveys of a range of volcanoes. This\nhas sown doubt as to whether pre-caldera tumescence\nIntroduction 307\nis important enough to be recorded in significant geolo-\ngical structures (Lipman, 1997). However, theNorthern\nMarginal Zone of the Rum Central Complex has been\nshown to contain exceptional evidence for intrusion-\ninduced uplift prior to caldera collapse (Troll, Emeleus\n& Donaldson, 2000). Holohan et al. have investigated\nthe lithological characteristics and field relationships\nof equivalent rocks within the remote, extensive, and\nmore deeply dissected Southern Mountains Zone,\nallowing further constraint of the processes during pre-\ncaldera tumescence. They provide detailed evidence\nto underpin reinterpretation of intrusive rhyodacite\nsills and subterranean explosion breccias as extrusive\nignimbrites and sedimentary mass-movement deposits,\nrespectively. In terms of geological processes, this\nnew evidence refines our understanding of a rarely\npreserved sequence of rocks that record volcano-\nsedimentary responses to intrusion-induced uplift and\ncaldera collapse.\nEarly felsic magmatism on Rum included intrusive\nbodies as well as caldera-fill material. The Western\nGranite on Rum is the largest of several granitic bodies\naround the margin of the Rum Central Complex, all\nof which are interpreted as part of the early felsic\nupdoming and caldera collapse episode. Petronis et al.\n(this volume) report palaeomagnetic and anisotropy\nof magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data that bear on\nthe emplacement and deformation of the Western\nGranite. The data indicate a component of outward\ntilting, recorded in the Western Granite, which did not\naffect the younger Layered Suite. This suggests that\nemplacement of the ultrabasic magmas at a shallow\ncrustal level caused significant distortion and local\nremobilization of the country rocks; roof uplift and\nassociated tilt of theWesternGranite probably occurred\nto make space for mafic magma emplacement. On the\nbasis of magnetic fabric magnitude and susceptibility\nparameters, Petronis et al. recognize two principal\ngroupings in the Western Granite AMS dataset, and\nsuggest that these record sub-vertical magma ascent\nnear a feeder conduit in the east, with sub-horizontal\nflowwestwards away from the conduit forming a sheet-\nlike intrusion. The magnetic foliations, together with\ndeformation of the country rock, suggest that doming\nalso accompanied emplacement of the early granitic\nmagma.\nPerhaps the most widely known parts of the Rum\nCentral Complex are its classic mafic to ultramafic\nlayered intrusions. The Eastern Layered Intrusion has\nlong been recognized as having been built up from a\nnumber of discrete chamber replenishment events. The\nclassical idea of Brown (1956) is that there were 16\nsuch events, each corresponding to a single macro-unit.\nHolness & Winpenny (this volume) have carried out a\ndetailed investigation of the Unit 12 allivalite, using\npreviously published isotope data together with new\ntextural and geochemical data, and they demonstrate\nthat this 16 m thick body recordsmore than half a dozen\nreplenishment events, at least one of which triggered an\neruption. The replenishing magmas varied from picrite\nto basalt and had highly variable degrees of interaction\nwith crustal material before arriving in the shallow-\nlevel chamber. At its thinnest, the sill-like chamber\nmay have been only a few tens of metres thick. Holness\n& Winpenny propose that the idea of a large magma\nchamber, periodically refilled with large amounts of\npicrite, needs to be revised towards a model in which a\nshallow chamber was fed by small batches of highly\nvariable magma, probably sourced from a series of\ndeeper chambers.\nAcknowledgments.
