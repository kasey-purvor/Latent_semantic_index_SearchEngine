THE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE  24 BOX 1: Zipf\u2019s law and the Pareto distribution Zipf\u2019s law for cities [Zipf (1949)] is an empirical regularity that has attracted considerable interest by researchers. In its strict version, which is also known as the ranksize rule, the law is a deterministic rule that states that the second largest city is half the size of the largest, the third largest city is a third of the size of the largest city, etc. To illustrate, let us take a country (for instance the US), and order its cities by population: New York as the largest has rank 1, Los Angeles as the second largest has rank 2, etc. We then draw a graph, known as Zipf\u2019s plot (see Fig. B.1): on the y-axis, we place the log of the rank (New York has log rank ln1, Los Angeles log rank ln2); on the x-axis, the log of the population of the corresponding city (which will be called the size of the city). If the rank-size rule holds, this produces a downwards sloping line with slope equal to -1.","cites":null},{"id":17289423,"title":"Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach,","authors":[],"date":"2007","doi":"10.1002\/jae.665","raw":"Wooldridge, Jeffrey (2007), Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 3 rd edition, southWestern.","cites":null},{"id":17289417,"title":"Ioannides (2004), \u2018The Evolution of City Size Distributions,\u2019","authors":[],"date":null,"doi":"10.1016\/s1574-0080(04)80010-5","raw":"Gabaix, Xavier and Yannis M.

Introduction \nThe geographic concentration of economic activity occurs because transport costs for \ngoods, people and ideas give individuals and organisations incentives to locate close to \neach other. If such costs did not exist economic activity would tend to spread evenly over \nspace. Historically, all of these transport costs have been falling. For example, the steam \nengine, railways, the combustion engine and the use of containers for transportation have \nall worked to reduce the cost of shipping goods, while the automobile, commuter railways \n Thanks go to Kwok Song Too for data, and to Filipe Lage de Sousa, Kay Shan and Stefanie Sieber for research assistance.  \nComments by Marcus Berliant, Antonio Ciccone, Anna Hardman, Vernon Henderson, Soks Kim, Jed Kolko, Diego Puga, Will \nStrange, Ping Wang and Zhu Wang, and other participants at presentations at Athens University of Economics and Business, \nUniversity of Helsinki, University College London, Washington University in Saint Louis, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Kansas \nCity Federal Reserve Bank, and the International Workshop on \u201cAgglomeration and Growth in Knowledge-based Societies\u201d \nare gratefully acknowledged.

More \nrecently, new information and communication technologies (ICT) have also significantly \nreduced the cost of transmitting and communicating information over both long and short \ndistances. Such changes could lead us to predict the death of distance. That is, to suggest \nthat location will no longer matter and that economic activity will, in the near future, be \nevenly distributed across space. This paper is concerned with one particular aspect of this \nprediction: the impact that less costly communication and transmission of information \nmight have on cities, the urban structure and the spatial distribution of economic activity. \nTwo innovations in the twentieth century have changed dramatically the cost of \ncommunicating and transmitting information. The first is the widespread adoption of \ntelephony (first fixed line, then mobile), which made possible oral communication over \nlong distances. The second main innovation is the internet and E-mail which has played a \nsimilar role for written documents, voice and images. Both these technologies may require \nsubstantial upfront fixed investments, but once made they essentially eliminate the link \nbetween the cost of communication and the distance between locations. \nWhat are the implications of these changes in ICT for urban structure and the \ndistribution of economic activity in space? This paper provides a partial answer to this \nquestion. We begin with a brief description of the adoption path for a number of recent \nICT innovations before turning to consider in more detail the ways in which ICT might \naffect urban structure. We next present the main theoretical argument and identification \nstrategy. Our model suggests that improvements in ICT will increase the dispersion of \neconomic activity across cities. That is, it will make city sizes more uniform. In the \nempirical section, we test this prediction using cross country data and find empirical \nsupport for this conclusion. A concluding section spells out a number of policy \nimplications. \n2. ICT and urban structure \nFigure 1. Private Cars, Mobile Phones and Personal Computers \nAbout here \nChanges in ICT are very clear in the data, especially if we focus on technology adoption. \nFigure 1 presents the number of cars, phone lines, mobile phones, and personal computers \nduring the last five decades, using Comin and Hobijin\u2019s \u201cHistorical Cross-Country \nTechnological Adoption Dataset\u201d [Comin and Hobijin (2004)]. The adoption of the \ntelephone was well under way by the 1950's. By the end of the 1990's, the number of \ntelephone lines exceeds 150 million in both Europe and the US. In contrast, changes in \npersonal computers are all concentrated in the 1980's and 1990's. The US went from less \nthan 5 million computers in the early 1980's to more than 140 million computers in the \nlate 1990's. This is a remarkable change that is likely to have very important effects. The \ndata show a similar pattern for the EU that went from less than 5 million personal \ncomputers to 100 million in the late 1990's. The EU and the US have also experienced \nsimilar dramatic changes in the use of cell phones, but with the growth occurring even \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 3 \n \nlater than for personal computers. Mobile telephones technology was practically unused in \n1985, but more than 150 million people owned a mobile phone in the 1990's in the EU, \nand more than 85 million in the US. Of course, these numbers alone do not reflect the \ncosts associated with implementation of these technologies but they do show the dramatic \ngrowth in adoption.  \n     Particularly significant is therefore to contrast the linear growth in number of cars or \nphones with the exponential growth in new forms of ICT. If part of the role of cities is to \nsave on communication costs, and given that the dramatic growth in ICT adoption has \nclearly lowered these costs, it seems intuitive that these changes could have some \nsignificant implications for urban structure. It is to these implications that we now turn. \nEconomists use the phrase \u201cagglomeration economies\u201d to describe the advantages that \noccur when economic activity is densely concentrated. The first source of agglomeration \neconomies is known as human capital or knowledge spillovers. In areas of dense \neconomic activity, workers casually exchange knowledge about technology and \nproduction conditions at their places of employment. Such transfers happen fortuitously \nbut also are sometimes sought out deliberately by firms, as anecdotal evidence about life \nin California\u2019s Silicon Valley testifies. A second force for agglomeration is labour market \npooling. At any point in time, firms are subject to idiosyncratic shocks (e.g. as a result of \nchanging demand for their particular product) that makes them want to hire or fire \nworkers. Because these shocks are idiosyncratic, when one firm is firing, another firm \nmay well be hiring. If firms locate in close proximity to one another, it is easy for workers \nto move from firms experiencing bad times to those experiencing good times. As the \nsaying in Silicon Valley goes, \u201cpeople change jobs but not parking lots.\u201d Agglomeration \nis thus attractive to workers because it helps insure them against idiosyncratic shocks. It is \nalso attractive for firms because it weakens the impact of wages to their own idiosyncratic \nshock and thus mitigates in part the effect of uncertainty in the economic environment. \nThis actually makes employment in bad times more costly than it would otherwise have \nbeen, but this is more than compensated for by the ease of expansion in good times. A \nthird force for agglomeration comes from the greater variety of intermediate products and \nricher mix of labour skills and expertise that are available in larger urban areas. Greater \nvariety of goods and services lowers prices and wages and also enhances firms\u2019 options in \nchoosing technologies for production and distribution of their products. The associated \neffects on firms are known as pecuniary externalities (as distinct from real externalities, \nthe latter term being reserved for non-market interactions among economic agents\u2019 output \ndecisions). Finally, local amenities due to weather, physical attractiveness, culture or \ntradition are important factors in enhancing the appeal of particular urban agglomerations. \nThese mechanisms, whose articulation essentially goes back to Alfred Marshall\u2019s \nPrinciples of Economics, explain at least some of the spatial concentration that we \nobserve throughout the world. \nOf course, if these agglomeration economies were the only forces driving the location \nof economic activity then we would expect to observe extreme spatial concentration. In \nreality, we do not, because these agglomeration economies are offset by costs (dispersion \nor congestion forces) as activity becomes increasingly concentrated. These costs take \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 4 \n \nmany forms but all arise from the fact that competition for local resources, broadly \ndefined, increases with spatial concentration. For example, congestion occurs as a result \nof increased competition for space, firms pay higher rents and wages as result of increased \ncompetition for land and workers, while they receive lower prices for their output as a \nresult of increased competition in goods markets. The balance between these \nagglomeration and dispersion forces determines the spatial structure of the economy. \nThe strength and importance of these agglomeration and dispersion forces depend on \nmany things, including notably the cost of communicating information across space. \nKnowledge spillovers, for example, depend on the role that distance plays in inhibiting \nefficient communication of ideas. The importance of face to face communication shows \njust how dramatic these distance effects can be. But the telephone, the email and video \nconferencing, for example, are all reducing these costs of communicating ideas from a \ndistance.  \nChanging communication costs may also affect the benefits from labour market \npooling. Recall, these benefits require workers to move from firm to firm. ICT may \nincrease the efficiency of this process as news about vacancies in one firm are more easily \ncommunicated to workers who may be looking for work. A similar story could be told \nabout the benefits of pecuniary externalities. For example, falling information costs allow \nfirms to more easily identify potential suppliers of intermediate goods or workers with \nparticular skills. Turning to dispersions forces, ICT may facilitate e-working, allowing \nindividuals to avoid the high costs of commuting in congested cities. Alternatively, it may \nincrease the competition faced by firms as consumers find it easier to identify alternative \nsources of supply. \nThus, new ways to transport ideas and to communicate information are, in general, \nlikely to affect all of the agglomeration and dispersion forces that urban and regional \neconomists have identified as key determinants of the concentration of economic activity \nin space. Thus, independently of the sources of agglomeration forces, ICT will likely have \nan impact on spatial concentration. In what follows, we illustrate the potential impact of \nICT by focusing on production externalities as the main source of agglomeration. This \ngives us a specific prediction about the impact of ICT that we then confirm using real \nworld data. These effects may also be consistent with other models where ICT has a \nsimilar effect on different agglomeration economies. So, our exercise does not allow us to \ndiscriminate between different models which predict that ICT will disperse economic \nactivity across cities. It does, however, suggest that models that predict changes to city \nstructure in the opposite direction (i.e. increasing concentration) are not consistent with \nthe data. \nICT can, in principle, have many distinct effects on the distribution of economic \nactivity in space. On one hand, it can increase the spatial scope of knowledge spillovers \n\u2014 it is easier for any professional to acquire context that helps her assess information she \ncasually receives from counterparts in other firms. Therefore, fewer person-to-person \ninteractions may suffice to obtain a better understanding of what other firms are up to. To \nthe extent that knowledge spillovers, whether deliberate (as among employees of the same \nfirm) or fortuitous, are productive, we would expect that ITC would strengthen them \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 5 \n \namong individuals who are located further apart. Local increasing returns are thus less \nlocalized when a wider set of people across an entire country or across countries can \ninteract with each other by using new technologies and while economizing on commuting \ncosts. In this sense, improvements in ICT reduce the importance of the quantities of \nproductive factors employed in a city on that city\u2019s productivity. This is the stand we take \non the theory we present in the next section and in more detail in Appendix A. \nThis implies that local urban agglomeration effects become less important and lead to \nless concentration of people and jobs in a few successful (and larger cities) or urban \nagglomerations. Agents and firms obtain smaller benefits from locating close to each \nother and so they locate more evenly in space in order to economize on land rents (and \nother congestion costs). ICT, in particular, can help businesses create opportunities by \nimproving their communications with other firms, suppliers and clients worldwide. For \nexample, real estate, tourism and hotel operators may market their products directly, \nwithout relying on city-based intermediaries. This is important, as most of recent urban \ngrowth worldwide has been fuelled by growth in service sectors, while manufacturing has \nbeen relocating to smaller urban centres with good transportation links [Henderson \n(1997)] and often are outsourced to lower cost countries.  \nThese arguments associate ICT with greater spatial dispersion in economic activity. \nThis would, in turn, imply larger concentration of the city size distribution. That is, it \nwould be associated with a reduction in the variance of city sizes. Arguably, this potential \nadvantage may not be fully realized if the interurban transportation system does not \ndevelop sufficiently to serve a greater network of urban centres. However, at any given \nlevel of development, improvements in ICT increase the incentives for economic activity \nto relocate to smaller urban centres. \nOn the other hand, ICT may also make certain local public goods more important as a \nshare of consumption or as a share of inputs. Also, changes in the industrial composition \nof cities, which have been favouring services, may on balance foster concentration of \ncertain services due to increasing returns at the plant level. London, New York or Paris \nare attractive in part because there are certain products and services that can only be found \nthere. Similarly, urban living affords better consumption prospects. As individuals spend \nmore on amenities, such as theatres and other artistic activities, certain large cities would \nbecome relatively more attractive and therefore likely to grow relative to smaller or \nmedium size cities. On top of increasing the share of some of these goods and services in \nconsumption, better ICT may make these goods and services more readily available and \ncheaper to consume. Clearly, to the extent that public goods (and other forces of urban \nconcentration) become effective and far-reaching with ICT, we should observe a more \ndispersed size distribution of cities and a more concentrated spatial distribution of \neconomic activity.  \nFrom this verbal discussion -- and other ones in the literature, like Glaeser (1998) which \nis more extensive but still qualitative -- it should be clear that there are two key paths \nthrough which ICT may affect the urban structure. But it is still not clear which effect is \nlikely to dominate. Thus our next step is to develop a theoretical model which will make \nall these connections clear. In particular, it will connect changes in ICT with changes in \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 6 \n \nthe size distribution of cities. As we will show, the effect on urban structure generated by \nthe model will depend on the particular assumption made on how ICT affects \nagglomeration forces. This relationship is monotonic and so it helps us design an \nempirical exercise that is informative on which of these different effects dominates in \nreality.  \n3. A Model of ICT and Urban Evolution \nAs discussed above, any reasonable model of urban structure or of the role of space in \neconomic activity, more generally, would predict that improvements in ICT should have \neffects on the distribution of economic activity in space. However, no model of urban \nsystems seems to have explicitly incorporated the effects of ICT. We use the theory in \nRossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007), from now on RHW, to illustrate how ICT may lead to \nmore urban dispersion.  \nTo reiterate, the trade-off between agglomeration effects \u2014the benefits that firms and \nindividuals obtain from being close to each other\u2014 and congestion costs determines the \nsize of cities. Most of these agglomeration effects are related to interactions of different \ntypes among individuals. These interactions will be affected by the communication and \ninformation technology used by these agents. But how will ICT affect agglomeration \nforces? And how will these changes in agglomeration forces change the distribution of \neconomic activity in space?  The paper addresses this question by considering the impact \nof these changes on the steady state distribution of city sizes. This requires in turn the \nspecification of a fully dynamic model that also accommodates a stochastic structure.   \nThe potential effect of ICT on the dispersion of the size distribution of cities is not \nobvious. Essentially, we need to understand whether the consequences of productivity \nshocks, or of other shocks that cities may experience, will be more or less persistent, and \nwill have larger or smaller effects, the larger agglomeration forces. The model in RHW \nviews the connection between agglomeration effects and productivity as mediated by \nindustry-specific physical and human capital. Agglomeration effects are the result of an \nexternality generated by the amount of human capital and labour employed in the city. \nTo illustrate this mechanism, suppose that an industry receives a positive and persistent \nproductivity shock. Naturally, firms in the cities that produce in those industries will want \nto produce more. This implies that they want to use more of the industry specific factors. \nBut the total availability of those factors is given in the current period. So the price of the \nindustry specific physical and human capital increases. The positive productivity shock \nalso implies that cities specialized in that industry will grow as firms employ more \nworkers. The higher price of the industry specific human and physical capital will create \nincentives to accumulate more of these factors. So next period the industry will have more \nindustry specific factors. Because of the agglomeration effects (and this is the key) having \nmore of these factors will imply more workers being hired and higher productivity, which \nin turn will elicit further accumulation of factors and induce larger cities, even if next \nperiod\u2019s productivity shock is lower. That is, the effect of the original productivity shock \non city size will be persistent through its effect on the accumulation of industry specific \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 7 \n \nfactors. The stocks of these factors are determined by the accumulated history of the \nindustry\u2019s productivity shocks and, therefore, the size distribution of cities is determined \nby the history of these shocks. It is the long run invariant distribution of these factors \nacross industries which then determine the long run invariant size distribution of cities. \nThe mechanism described above relies crucially on the impact that the level of human \nand physical capital has on the level of productivity in a city \u2014 that is, on the strength of \nthe agglomeration effects. The stronger these effects, the larger the impact of past \nproductivity and the larger the reaction of city size and industry specific factors to an \nidiosyncratic productivity shock. If agglomeration forces are very small and the \nproductivity of an industry producing in a given city is essentially independent of the level \nof human capital and employment in the city (and therefore the level of physical capital), \ntoday\u2019s productivity shock will have only a temporary effect on city size and no effect on \nthe long term stock of these factors. Hence, cities will not grow and may even decline \nsubstantially depending on the history of shocks to an industry. This implies that all cities \nwill have similar sizes and so the distribution of city sizes will be extremely concentrated. \nIf all cities are of similar sizes, the distribution of economic activity in space will exhibit a \nlot of dispersion. Note that the more concentrated the size distribution of cities the more \ndispersed the distribution of economic activity in space. \nIn contrast, if agglomeration effects depend heavily on the amount of factors employed \nin a city, the effect of past shocks on the stock of industry specific factors will be very \nimportant. Cities specialized in industries that received a history of good shocks will be \nvery large, and cities that received a history of bad shocks will be small. Hence, the size \ndistribution of cities will be very dispersed and the distribution of economic activity in \nspace will be very concentrated. \nIn Appendix A we present the details of the model in RHW that yields the result \ndiscussed above in an economy. The model allows for accumulation of physical and \nhuman capital and city creation and yields a realistic size distribution of cities. However, \nthe main economic mechanism can be illustrated in a much simplified model, albeit a \nstatic and partial equilibrium one, which we sketch here. Consider a city with an \naggregate production function that implies output per person in the form \nY = A(N)T( N), \nwhere ( )A N AN \u03b5= % , is total employment in the city, N A% is a productivity shock and \n( )T N TN \u03c4\u2212=  the time agents have left for work after commuting. The latter specification \nis a short hand in order to express the combined effect of declining marginal productivity \nof labour and congestion. For an exact derivation within a dynamic general equilibrium \nmodel, please see Appendix A. An alternative derivation that is also helpful in \nunderstanding interurban spillovers is given in the comment by one of our discussants, \nOmer Moav, following the paper. We assume that the respective elasticities satisfy  \u03c4 \u03b5>  \nso that in effect city production is subject to diminishing returns.  \nThe parameter \u03b5  plays a key role in our analysis. It captures the extent to which the \nsize of the city affects its productivity through knowledge spillovers. More specifically, \u03b5  \ndenotes the elasticity of productivity with respect to city size. We model this elasticity as \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 8 \n \na result of knowledge spillovers, but in fact it can be the result of any other agglomeration \nmechanism. Note that the level of \u03b5  will also affect the average size of spillovers. So an \nincrease in \u03b5  will tend to induce concentration in large cities.  \nWith free labour mobility across cities and identical productivity shock process in all \ncities it has to be the case that income per person is the same across cities. Call this \nequilibrium income level . Then  by using the above specifications we have: w\nATN w\u03b5 \u03c4\u2212 =% , \nwhich, given , determines the equilibrium value of population in a particular city as   w N\n1\nATN\nw\n\u03c4 \u03b5\u2212\u239b \u239e= \u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n%\n. (1) \nSo the elasticity of with respect to N A%  is equal to 1 ( )\u03c4 \u03b5\u2212 . Now let the quality of \nICT determine the value of \u03b5 . If \u03b5  decreases with better ICT, an improvement in ICT \nleads to a decrease in the elasticity of city sizes with respect to idiosyncratic shocks and, \nin the long run (under some technical conditions), to a decrease in the variance of the size \ndistribution of cities. If, in contrast, ICT increases \u03b5 then it increases the elasticity of city \nsizes with respect to idiosyncratic shocks and, in the long run, it increases the variance of \nthe size distribution of cities. So the actual effect of ICT on \u03b5  is, ultimately, an empirical \nquestion that we try to settle in this paper. A similar analysis may be cast in terms of a \npossible role of telecommuting in affecting the elasticity of time left for work with respect \nto total city employment, but will not be discussed here for reasons of brevity. Again, the \nmodel presented in Appendix A allows for much greater generality and detail.  \nOf course, changes in ICT will in general change the level of technology too. Local \ninteractions may become less important with ICT, but global ones will then become more \nimportant. The latter change would be reflected in an increase in the mean of A% .  \nIdeally one would model explicitly the decision of agents in a city to adopt ICT. This \nhas not been done in the literature in a way that may be readily adopted for our purposes. \nHere we only study the effect on urban structure given exogenous technology adoption \ndecisions. We refrain from developing such a theory because it is unlikely that in view of \nour data we would be able to distinguish between alternative theories of the precise role of \nICT in affecting the elasticities of the spillover effects.  \nAs it is easy to note, the role played in the dynamic version by the persistence of shocks \ntrough their effect on the accumulation of industry specific factors is substituted in this \nsimple model by the distribution of productivity shocks itself. Therefore this simple \nmodel cannot, by design, generate a realistic size distribution of cities or a realistic pattern \nof city dynamics. However, it is important to make sure that the logic of the example \nsurvives in a model that can generate basic features of the urban hierarchy. This is not \nimmediate since changes in \u03b5  (through ICT) will in general change the accumulation of \nfactors and therefore the distribution of productivities in our simple model above. The \ndynamic general equilibrium model in Appendix A confirms that the basic insight of the \nsimple model in the previous paragraphs, and the logic outlined at the beginning of this \nsection, goes through in a more complete economic environment.  \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 9 \n \n \n4. Empirical Methodology \nOur theoretical model, as developed in Appendix A, predicts that ICT should make the \ndistribution of city sizes in the long run more concentrated if it weakens agglomeration \neffects. We study this prediction empirically by looking at the effect of ICT on the \ndistribution of city sizes across different countries. \nBox 1 \nAbout here \nUnfortunately, as will be clear when we discuss our data in Section 5 below, the \navailable data only tend to cover the larger cities in each country. This is a problem for \nour empirical implementation because such truncated data (i.e. data that do not cover the \nsmaller cities) do not allow us to calculate the mean and variance of the entire city size \ndistribution directly. To get around this problem, we proceed as follows. First, we assume \nthat the city size distribution is Pareto (alternatively referred to as following a power law). \nGiven this assumption we can express the log of the proportion of cities that are larger \nthan S, that is the log of the counter-cumulative of the size distribution of cities, as a linear \nfunction of log city size:  \nln ( ) ln lnoP s S S S\u03b6 \u03b6> = \u2212 + ,   (2) \nwhere  denotes the minimum city size, which defines the lower bound of the city size \ndistribution, and \noS\n\u03b6 the elasticity of the proportion of cities larger than S with respect to S.  \nThe latter is a negative number that is commonly referred to as the Zipf coefficient. See \nBox 1 for details. Given a set of cities and their sizes, an estimate of the Zipf coefficient is \nprovided by running a regression of log rank on log city size. When the distribution is \nPareto the Zipf coefficient can be consistently estimated by running the regression only on \nthe sample of the larger cities, that is the upper tail of the distribution. \nWe have underscored the model\u2019s prediction that improvements in ICT will decrease \nthe variance of the cross-sectional distribution of cities. In Appendix A we show that this \nleads to a higher absolute value of the Zipf coefficient, ( )S\u03b6 . Hence, the absolute value \nof the Zipf coefficient increases with improvements in ICT, at least when attention is \nrestricted to the upper tail of city sizes. In other words, improvements in the quality of \nICT decrease the variance of the size distribution while they increase the absolute value of \nthe Zipf coefficient. Since the Zipf coefficient is negative, they decrease its algebraic \nvalue. This result holds independently of whether or not the city size distribution is \nPareto. Of course, if it is not Pareto, the Zipf coefficient will not be a constant, but the \nmodel predicts that its value will change in the same direction for all, large enough, city \nsizes. It is important to note that even though our basic theory implies a Pareto \ndistribution of city sizes only for particular cases (see RHW for details), we approach the \ndata using Zipf coefficients that are specified as independent of city size. That is, we \nassume that the size distribution is always Pareto. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 10 \n \nSo our assumption of a particular distribution for city sizes gives us a specification that \ncan be estimated given the data that we have at our disposal and that allows us to directly \ntest our theory on the impact of ICT on the city size distribution. The crucial question is \nthen, of course, whether this is an appropriate assumption. It turns out that empirical \nevidence gives us good reason to think that the Pareto distribution is a reasonable fit for \nreal world city size distributions across a large numbers of countries and at many different \npoints in time. Even if the distribution is not Pareto, it is likely that reductions in variance \nwill be associated with change for the Zipf coefficient (as discussed above) in the same \ndirection. In the discussion of our empirical results, section 6 below, we also address this \nconcern by presenting robustness checks using other measures of dispersion in the upper \ntail. \nOnce we have the estimated Zipf coefficient, we may use it as a summary of the city \nsize distribution for different countries and examine how variations in the city size \ndistribution may be attributed to the observed changes in ICT. Clearly a large number of \nother factors will determine the city size distribution and we will need to control for these \nif we want to isolate the effect of ICT. We discuss and motivate these additional controls \nin the results section below. \nTo capture the effects of ICT we use data on the number of telephone lines and on \naccess to the internet. Our main focus is on the number of telephone lines for several \nreasons. First, because we have more data. Second, because the impact on the urban \nstructure will take time and, as Figure 1 shows, the rapid adoption of internet technology \nhas only occurred relatively recently. Third, because for telephone lines we have a way to \ndeal with the endogeneity problem for ICT. That is, we have a way to control for the fact \nthat the number of telephone lines may be driven by the urban structure, rather than the \nother way round. As no such instrumental variable is available for the internet, our results \nwhen we use access to the internet as an additional explanatory variable are necessarily \nmore speculative (although both sets of results point in the same direction). We discuss \nthis issue further below after we provide details of our empirical strategy.  \nThe Zipf coefficient for a country  in year c t  is obtained from the following \nregression: \nict ct ct ict ictR P e\u03bb \u03b6= + + , (3) \nwhere  is the log of the rank of city  in country  in year ln(rank )ict ictR = i c t ,  is the \nlog population of that city, \nictP\nct\u03bb  is a country-year specific intercept, and ct\u03b6  is a country-\nyear specific Zipf coefficient. \nWe follow Rosen and Resnick (1980) and subsequently Soo (2005) in seeking to \nunderstand the determinants of the Zipf coefficient ct\u03b6  in (3) in terms of country \ncharacteristics: \nct c ct ctt X\u03b6 \u03b8 \u03b4 \u03b7 \u03b5= + + + , (4) \nwhere c\u03b8  is a constant which may be country specific, \u03b4  is a linear time trend  and  is \na vector of unknown coefficients. The parameter \n\u03b7\nc\u03b8 , sometimes known as a country fixed \neffect, controls for the fact that the Zipf coefficient may be higher or lower for some \nparticular country in all years for reasons that are unobservable to us as researchers.  The \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 11 \n \nlinear time trend controls for the fact that the Zipf coefficient may be increasing or \ndecreasing over time for all countries for reasons that, again, are unobservable to us as \nresearchers.  Finally, the coefficients in \u03b7  capture the effect of changes in explanatory \nvariables (including ICT) on the Zipf coefficient.  The coefficients in equation (4) can be \nestimated by means of a regression of Zipf coefficients for each country and year, \u02c6ct\u03b6 , \nthat are estimated according to (3), on a collection of explanatory variables ctX  that are \nthought to determine the city size distribution.  \nWe make three modifications to this standard approach. The first deals with a potential \nbias in the estimation of the Zipf coefficient. In a recent paper, Gabaix and Ibragimov \n(2006) return to a known bias of the estimate of the Zipf coefficient from Equation (3). \nThis bias arises from the fact that ranks and sizes are obviously correlated. The bias is \nstrong in small samples and their proposed correction1is to use  in \nplace of the log rank in the left hand side of Equation (3). \nln(rank 0.5)ict ictR\n\u2217 = \u2212\nThe second modification exploits the fact that we have panel data (i.e. data on cities and \ncountry characteristics for several years) to control for unobserved country specific \ndeterminants of differences in the city size distribution. This is captured by the country \nspecific intercept, or fixed effect, c\u03b8  in equation (4). Of course, as usual, if ctX  contains \ntime invariant observed characteristics then their coefficients cannot be separately \nidentified via econometric procedures because the country specific intercept captures all \ntime invariant differences across countries whatever their source.  \nThe third modification deals with the likely endogeneity of telephone lines with respect \nto the urban structure. We want to be able to interpret the coefficient on telephone lines \nfrom equation (4) as capturing the impact on the Zipf coefficient of changing the number \nof telephone lines per capita.  That is, we want to be able to talk about the causal effect of \nICT on urban structure. But what if changes to the urban structure come from some other \nsource (say the increasing use of the automobile, which incidentally we do control for, in \npart via the road density variable) and countries respond to this by changing the number of \ntelephone lines per capita? Then, the number of telephone lines per capita would be driven \nby a different underlying factor and thus a function of urban structure, and thus be \nendogenous. In such a case, our regression will capture an association between ICT and \nurban structure which includes both the direct causal effect (from ICT to urban structure) \nand any indirect feedback effects (from urban structure to ICT).  In the worst case \nscenario, there may actually be no causal effect of ICT on urban structure, but we may \nreach the erroneous conclusion that there is an effect, because our regressions pick up the \nreverse feedback effect from urban structure to ICT. To control for this we adopt an \ninstrumental variables approach.  That is, we look for some variables (i.e. country \ncharacteristics) that (1) do not change if the urban structure changes for some exogenous \nreason (e.g. the increase in the availability of the automobile) and that (2) do not \nthemselves independently affect the urban structure but that are (3) correlated with the \n                                                          \n1 According to Gabaix and Ibragimov (2006), Theorem 1, the correction of the bias in \nthe OLS estimate is optimal in the sense that the proposed transformation of the \ndependent variable reduces the bias to leading order only. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 12 \n \nnumber of telephone lines. We can then use these instrumental variables to capture the \ncausal effect of the number of telephone lines on urban structure. To do this, we first \npredict the number of telephone lines in a given country and year on the basis of the \nvalues of the instrumental variables. We then include these predicted values in place of \nthe actual values of telephone lines in equation 4.  If we find that these predicted values of \ntelephone lines still have an affect on urban structure, then we can reason as follows.  We \nknow that the predicted values are not capturing any direct effect of the instrumental \nvariables on urban structure (because we assumed \u2013 condition (2) \u2013 that these variables do \nnot independently affect the urban structure). We also know that the predicted values \ncannot be capturing any feedback effect from urban structure to ICT because we are \npredicting phone lines per capita as a function of the instrumental variables (and we \nassumed \u2013 condition (1) \u2013  that these variables were independent of exogenous changes to \nurban structure). Thus, the predicted values must be capturing the causal impact of ICT on \nurban structure. Of course, for this strategy to work our instrumental variables must be \ncorrelated with ICT \u2013 condition (3) \u2013 so that the predicted values bear some relation to the \nactual values.  \n Our idea is to construct instrumental variables based on the market structure in the \ntelecommunications sector. Clearly market structure in the telecommunications sector \nshould affect the number of phone lines thus satisfying the third condition for a valid \ninstrument. Results that we report below show that this is indeed the case. \nTelecommunications market structure is also unlikely to have a direct effect on the urban \nstructure (independent of its affect on ICT), thus satisfying the second condition for a \nvalid instrument. What about the first condition that telecommunication market structure \nis not affected if urban structure changes for some exogenous reason? We find it hard to \ncome up with a convincing story where market structure is directly affected by changes to \nthe urban structure. But it is possible to come up with stories where both market structure \nand urban structure are being driven by some common factor that we have omitted from \nour estimation. For example the general trend towards liberalisation of the economy \nduring the 1980\u2019s affected many sectors in addition to the telecommunications sector. \nPerhaps it was the reform of one of these sectors (e.g. transport) that changed urban \nstructure. In that case, our instrument will fail to satisfy the first condition because it is \nactually changes in attitudes to liberalisation (exogenous to our model) that are changing \nboth urban structure and market structure. By including other measures of liberalisation, \nwe are able to provide some indirect evidence that this is not the case and that our \ninstruments are likely to be valid.  But, formally, conditions (1) and (2) are \u201cmaintained \nassumptions\u201d that cannot be easily tested and the instrumental approach relies on their \nholding. We find these assumptions reasonable, but some readers may not do, in which \ncase our assertion of a causal effect of ICT on urban structure will need to be interpreted \nwith caution.  \nWe can identify three broad market structures for the countries in our sample during the \nyears that we study: competitive, public or private monopoly. Two of the instruments that \nwe use are dummies for whether the country has a public monopoly or a private \nmonopoly with a competitive structure as the excluded category. The other two \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 13 \n \n                                                          \ninstruments measure the time that has passed since the end of the private and public \nmonopolies for countries that have liberalised their telecommunications sector. As no \nsuch instrumental variables are available for the internet, our results when we use access \nto the internet as an additional explanatory variable are necessarily more speculative \n(although both sets of results do point in the same direction). \nFinally, in addition, we report in Appendix B a fourth modification which increases the \nefficiency of the estimators by implementing a one-step procedure that simultaneously \nestimates equations (3) and (4). \nBefore turning to the implementation of our approach, we re-iterate that, although we \nrely on the Pareto law to motivate our econometric approach, our estimations should \ncapture more generally the impact upon the entire distribution of city sizes that emanate \nfrom changes in underlying determinants of interest. \n5. Data \nWe use the same city data as that used in Soo (2005), which were taken from Thomas \nBrinkhoff's City Population project (http:\/\/www.citypopulation.de). Soo's paper provides \na fairly extensive discussion of the nature of the data, particularly with regard to the issue \nof the definition of cities.2 Data on population, GDP per capita in 2000 Purchasing Power \nParity (PPP), trade and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP, non-agricultural \neconomic activity and land area come from the World Bank World Development \nIndicators (online). Data on kilometres of roads come from the International Road \nFederation World Road Statistics.3 GDP growth is calculated as log difference of GDP in \n2000 PPP; its volatility is measured as the empirical standard deviation over the observed \ntime period. \nWe use two different measures to evaluate the role of ICT in determining the city size \ndistribution: telephones and the internet. As already discussed, our main focus is on \ntelephones, because we have data for a longer time period and can construct a set of \npotential instruments. Data on the number of telephone land lines and internet users per \n1000 also come from the World Bank World Development Indicators. We multiply these \nnumbers by 1000 and use per capita measure of phone lines and internet users in the \nestimations. \nThe information on the market structure of the telecommunications sector (private or \npublic monopoly versus competitive provision) that we use to instrument the number of \n2 We use data on cities as opposed to urban agglomerations because they are more \nconsistently available internationally.  \n3 Further details on all these variables are provided in Soo (2005). A large number of \nour explanatory variables were also kindly provided by Kwok Tong Soo and \nsupplemented by the authors. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 14 \n \ntelephone lines comes from the OECD International Regulation Database.4 This same \nsource provides the data that we use to capture the general degree of competition in the \neconomy when considering the validity of our instruments. \nWe start with city-level data for 73 countries covering 7,530 different cities recorded at \nvarious time periods between 1972 and 2001. There are 197 country-year pairs meaning \nthat, on average, we observe each country 2.7 times. Detailed inspection of the data \nreveals that the relevant explanatory variables are missing for many countries. \nFortunately, the variables are available for three blocks of countries -- North America, \nEurope and some of the former countries of the Soviet Union.5 Deleting countries with \nmissing data leaves us with 24 countries covering 2,955 cities recorded at various time \nperiods between 1980 and 2000. There are now 63 country-year pairs meaning that, on \naverage, we observe each country 2.6 times. For the internet regressions we have to drop \nMexico and restrict the time period to 1990 to 2000. This gives us 23 countries and 41-\ncountry year pairs covering 2,792 cities. Error!

Additional \ndetails on our data variable definitions may be found in the online Data Appendix. \nTable 1: Descriptive statistics \nAbout here \n6. Results \nWe start by estimating Equation (3) for each country-year pair to get some idea of the \ndistribution of Zipf coefficients for the countries in question. The mean Zipf coefficient \nacross our 63 country-year pairs is -1.370. The maximum value is -0.928 for Belarus in \n1998, the minimum is -1.714 for Belgium in 2000. Interestingly, for all country-year pairs \nwe strongly reject the null hypothesis that the Zipf coefficient is equal to one.6 That is, we \nstrongly reject Zipf\u2019s law, strictly construed as an estimated Zipf coefficient (\u03b6  - the \n                                                          \n4 See the Indicators of Product Market Regulation Homepage at: \nhttp:\/\/www.oecd.org\/eco\/pmr and described in Conway (2006).

We have to drop Germany \nbecause of the reunification of 1990 and the ensuing adoption of Federal Republic of \nGermany institutions in former German Democratic Republic territory causes \ndefinitional problems.  \n6 Our result are broadly in line with those reported in Soo's 2005 table 1 which are for \nthe last year for each country-pair and which do not implement the Gabaix-Ibragimov \ncorrection. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 15 \n \nelasticity of the proportion of cities larger than S with respect to S) being equal to 1.  See \nBox 1, for more details. \nWe now turn to consider the effect that ICT has on the city size distribution as \nsummarized by the Zipf coefficient. As discussed in the data section, our main focus is on \nthe impact of phone lines. Figure 2 plots our estimates of Zipf coefficients for different \ncountries at different times against the number of telephone lines. Two things stand out \nfrom the plot. The first is that, overall, the relationship between Zipf coefficients and the \nnumber of telephone lines is as predicted. Second, looking at individual countries, we can \nsee the same effect replicated within the country in terms of changes over time. This is, \nperhaps, easiest to see for Belgium (BEL) and Austria (AUT), but careful inspection will \nconvince the reader that a similar pattern is observed for many countries. The rest of this \nsection formalises the findings that emerge from this scatter plot, showing that they are \nrobust to the introduction of additional explanatory variables and to controlling for the \nendogeneity of telephone lines. \n \nFigure 2. Estimated Zipf Coefficients against Telephone  \nMainlines, different countries and years. \nAbout here \nWe begin by estimating the simplest possible specification where we treat phone lines \nand a time trend as the only variable that explains differences in the Zipf coefficient \nacross countries and time. That is, we estimate Equation (4) with phone lines and time as \nthe only explanatory variable ( ctX ). The results are shown in column [1] of Error! \nReference source not found.. The positive time trend picks up the fact that, on average, \nacross all countries, variance in the city size is increasing over time. Our focus, however \nis on phone lines and we find that these have a significant negative impact on the Zipf \ncoefficient. That is, the more phone lines a country has, the more concentrated is its city \nsize distribution. This is consistent with our theoretical result that improvements in ICT \n(or, in the data, an increase in the number of phone lines) lead to smaller local external \neffects and therefore a more concentrated city size distribution. \n \nTable 2: Phone lines and the city size distribution \nAbout here \nClearly, there are many omitted characteristics of countries that could be correlated \nwith both phone lines and the degree to which population is spread out across the city size \ndistribution. Column [2] begins to address this problem by including several additional \nexplanatory variables. Before turning to discussing the empirical results, we briefly \nmotivate each of the additional control variables.  \nWe include the inverse of road density as a proxy for transport costs within the country. \nCountries with a low road density are likely to have high transport costs encouraging \npopulation to concentrate in just a few cities. Thus, we expect the coefficient on inverse \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 16 \n \n                                                          \nroad density to be positive (fewer roads imply higher inverse road density, higher \ntransport costs and urban population that is more concentrated in fewer cities). \nWe include three variables to control for the economic and geographic size of the \ncountry: population, income and land area. More densely populated countries are likely to \nhave more equal city size distribution, so we expect the coefficient on population to be \nnegative while that on land area should be positive. Although we do not constrain the \ncoefficients to be equal, these two variables could pick up other effects, thus introducing \nsome ambiguity about the expected signs on their coefficients. Given our focus on more \ndeveloped countries we have no strong prior on the sign of the coefficient on GDP. \nModels in the New Economic Geography tradition predict that our measure of trade \nopenness (trade as a percentage of GDP) should have a negative effect on spatial \nconcentration and hence on the Zipf coefficient because international trade weakens \nagglomeration forces (See Chapter 18 of Fujita et al., 1999). Similarly, we would expect \nhigher agricultural production to lead to less concentration and a flatter city size \ndistribution. That is, we expect the coefficient on non-agricultural sectors as a percentage \nof GDP to be positive. A measure of the size of government (government expenditure as a \nshare of GDP) allows for the possibility that larger governments may imply higher \npopulation concentration. That would indeed be the case if (as Ades and Glaeser (1995) \nemphasize) rent seeking behaviour encourages citizens to locate close to policy makers in \nthe capital city. Conversely, large governments have more means to work against \nagglomeration forces and support peripheral regions through regional policies. Thus we \nhave no strong priors on the sign of the coefficient on government expenditure. \n Finally, we include the standard deviation of the rate of growth of real GDP since the \ntheory underlying our approach (discussed in Appendix A) indicates that a higher \nvolatility of total factor productivity shocks should lead to a larger variance of the size \ndistribution and therefore larger Zipf coefficients. We also include the number of cities as \na convenient way of allowing for non-linearities in the Zipf regression.7\nResults reported in column [2] are in line with our expectations for all variables except, \ntrade as a percentage of GDP (which has the wrong sign), and the inverse of road density \nand the volatility of GDP (which are insignificant). Introducing country fixed effects and \ninstrumenting for phone lines per capita alters these findings so we consider the issue no \nfurther for now. Instead, we draw attention to the fact that introducing all of these controls \ndoes not change our conclusion on the role of phone lines. The coefficient is still negative \nand significant, albeit slightly smaller in absolute value. Thus, introducing a large number \nof additional controls does not change our conclusion that telephone lines are associated \nwith more concentrated city size distributions. \n7 Several studies, including notably Black and Henderson (2003), have emphasised \nthat the log rank - log population relationship is roughly concave. The relationship \ntherefore exhibits a steep (negative) slope for the highest ranked cities and a flatter (still \nnegative) slope for lower rank cities. Increasing the number of cities may therefore have \na positive impact on the coefficient. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 17 \n \nColumns [3] and [4] of Error! Reference source not found. report results after \nintroducing a country-specific fixed effect. Column [3] reports results when phone lines \nand a time trend are the only explanatory variable in ctX . Column [4] reports results when \nwe include the additional control variables. Note that the coefficients for four time \ninvariant variables cannot be identified in the fixed effect specification. These variables \nare time invariant either because of data availability (government expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP, standard deviation of GDP growth) or because they show very little \ntime series variation (land area and number of cities). Moving from column [2] to column \n[3] we see that introducing unobservable country-specific effects decreases the absolute \nvalue of the coefficient on phone lines, although the coefficient remains negative and \nsignificant. Introducing additional controls in column [4] now leaves the effect of \ntelephone lines per capita essentially unchanged. Note that, as alluded to above, the \nintroduction of fixed effects now gives us signs on inverse road density and on trade as a \npercentage of GDP that are consistent with our theory (although only trade is significant) \nThus, our finding that telephone lines are associated with less dispersed city size \ndistributions is robust to controlling for other country characteristics both observed and \nunobserved. \nOf course, one may still worry that the relationship is being driven by time varying \nunobserved characteristics of countries and that it is changes in these unobserved \ncharacteristics that drive changes in urban structure which, in turn drive changes in our \nexplanatory variables. For example, increasing car ownership may lead to the dispersion \nof population and telephone lines then respond to that dispersion (rather than vice versa). \nTo control for this, we adopt the standard solution of looking for instrumental variables as \ndiscussed, in depth, at the end of section 4.  \nOne might have similar concerns about inverse road density as a proxy for transport \ncosts. That is, more dispersed population leads to more roads and lower transport costs \nrather than transport costs driving population dispersion. We have experimented with \nlagged road density as an instrument but this resulted in considerable reductions in sample \nsize and little change in the coefficient on road density. As our main interest is in the ICT \nvariables, which we are able to instrument, we do not worry about this further other than \nto note that the coefficients on inverse road density should be interpreted with caution.8 \nWe assume that all other right hand side variables are exogenous. \nTable 3: First stage regressions for Table 2 \nAbout here \n                                                          \n8 In an earlier version of this paper, we also tried to instrument for trade as a percentage \nof GDP using two dummies indicating when a country joined EU or NAFTA. These two \nvariables turned out to be very weak instruments for trade, but reasonable additional \ninstruments for ICT.  For this reason, we no longer instrument trade, but continue to use \nthese two additional instruments.  We note that instrumenting trade using these regional \ntrade agreement dummies does not change our main finding on ICT.  Using only the \nmarket structure instruments  for ICT also does not change our results. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 18 \n \nFirst stage regression results from the regression of phone lines per capita on the \nexogenous and instrumental variables are reported in Table 3. In the cross section (column \n[5]), both public and private sector monopolies significantly decrease the number of \ntelephone lines. Adding additional control variables (column [6]) substantially weakens \nthe effect of the instruments. However, once we have included a fixed effect (columns [7] \nand [8]) we see that public monopolies are significantly positively associated with the \nnumber of phone lines. The F-test on the joint significance of the instruments for our \npreferred specification (column [8]) show that the model is fairly well instrumented (i.e. \nour instruments are fairly highly partially correlated with ICT).  \nSome of the time series variation in these variables comes from liberalization that \nmoved countries from private monopolies to competition. Most of the variation, however, \ncomes from privatization coupled with liberalization which moved countries from public \nmonopolies to competition.9 Our results in the most relevant specification in column [8] \nsuggest that, at least in terms of the number of phone lines, the efficiency effects of \nliberalization were outweighed by changes to public service agreements and the tendency \nfor newly privatized firms to reduce the cross-subsidisation of residential lines by \nbusiness users. Note that in all cases the predicted phone lines from the first stage \nregressions are increasing over time. The general increase of telephone mainlines is \nexplained by the time trends as well as increases in population, road density, and GDP. \nColumns [5]-[8] in Table 2 show what happens when we use these variables to \ninstrument for the number of phone lines. Column [5] ignores country fixed effects and \nincludes instrumented phone lines as the only explanatory variable. Comparing to column \n[1] we see that our results change very little. The effect of phone lines turns insignificant \nas we introduce more explanatory variables (compare column [6] to column [2]) but it is \nagain significant if we introduce fixed effects with phone lines on their own (column [7] \nversus column [3]) and if we introduce fixed effects and time-varying explanatory \nvariables (column [8] versus column [4]). \nIn sum, we find a robust negative significant effect of the number of phone lines per \ncapita on the Zipf coefficient. Over our study period, increasing phone lines per capita \nhave tended to cause the dispersion of population across the urban structure resulting in a \nmore concentrated city size distribution. \nColumns [1] and [2] of Table 4 show that we reach a similar conclusion for the impact \nof the internet on the city size distribution. Column [1] presents results from a regression \nof Zipf coefficients on the number of internet users per capita and a time trend. That is, \nfrom estimating equation (4) with internet users per capita and a time trend as the only \nexplanatory variable ( ctX ). We see a negative significant effect on the Zipf coefficient, \nalthough the effect is smaller than that of phone lines. Column [2] shows what happens \nwhen we introduce the same additional controls as we did for phone lines. Introducing \nadditional controls more than halves the absolute value of the coefficient on internet users \n                                                          \n9 During the time period we consider there were no privatisations that replace a public \nmonopoly with a private monopoly, although this had certainly happened in earlier \nperiods (e.g. in the United Kingdom). \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 19 \n \n                                                          \nper capita and turns it insignificant. Columns [3] and [4] show that the negative effect of \nthe internet vanishes once we also consider telephone mainlines. Results, not reported \nhere, show that instrumenting by means of the same set of instrumental variables gives \nvery similar coefficients, but at a slightly lower level of significance (5% instead of 1% in \ncolumn [1]). Only 16 countries have more than one year of data for internet usage so, not \nsurprisingly, implementing the fixed effects specification gives insignificant results. \nFinally, introducing fixed effects and instrumenting leads to coefficients that are \nessentially zero.10 This is hardly surprising given the limited number of observations and \nthe fact that market structure in the telecommunications sector does not provide good \ninstruments for the number of internet connections. \nOur results about the effect of internet connections on urban structure are encouraging \nfor another reason, too. As Figure 1 documents, the incidence of mobile telephony \nadoption is similar to that of the internet.  While direct measures of mobile telephony are \navailable for some countries, the pattern of availability as of now would reduce \nsubstantially sample size. We think it is difficult to find good instruments, especially since \nthe development of mobile telephony markets have been influenced by the different \nstandards adopted by providers. Therefore, we take the results of the internet connections, \nwhere in fact telephone use is also controlled for, as suggestive of the impact of mobile \ntelephony, a technology that is conceptually akin to a combination of telephony and the \ninternet.11\n6.1. Additional robustness checks \nA question concerning the nature of our instrumental variables strategy arises from \nconsidering the literature on the political economy of urbanization. This literature \nsuggests that urban concentration may be driven by the general degree of competition in \nthe economic and political spheres. This raises the possibility that some measure of the \ndegree of competition in the economy should be included directly in the regression, \nviolating the second requirement for the validity of an instrument (that it should have no \ndirect effect on urban structure). Using this line of reasoning, one could argue, for \nexample, that the industrial organization of the telecommunications sector is actually just \nproxying for an overly centralized public sector which favours larger cities. To \nsummarise, if industrial organization of the telecommunications sector is capturing other \nfactors that have a direct effect on urban concentration, then it is inappropriate as an \ninstrument. We explore this possibility by controlling for the general degree of \ncompetition in the economy using the OECD \u201cRegRef\u201d indicators of regulatory \n10 These results are available on request and documented in the Data Appendix. \n11 Modern mobile, that is cellular telephony was not invented in the same countries \nwhere it was first commercialized, such as Japan, but did indeed spread fast in sparsely \npopulated countries, such as the Nordic European countries, with whom is indeed \nnowadays closely associated. Still, adoption per capita is greatest is densely populated \nbut small countries, like Hong Kong and Luxemburg.  \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 20 \n \n                                                          \nconditions in the airlines, telecommunications, electricity, gas, post, rail, and road freight \nindustries of member countries (Conway and Nicoletti (2006)). The OECD claims that the \nRegRef indicators are a good proxy for the overall degree of competition in the economy. \nThe RegRef indicators are, unfortunately, only available for a subset of the countries in \nour data set. Specifically, data are not available for Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Mexico, \nPoland, Romania, Russian Federation, and Slovak Republic leaving 45 country-year pairs \ninstead of the 63 pairs originally. Re-estimation of the original model (column [8] in \nTable 2) with the reduced set of countries produces a stronger effect for phone lines, -\n0.308, which is significant at 1%. Including the average of all RegRef indicators as an \nadditional explanatory variable only slightly reduces the effect of phone lines to -0.280 \nand its significance to 2%. The coefficient on this new explanatory variable is virtually \nzero and highly insignificant.12 Taken together these results suggest that concerns about \nthe validity of our instrument as a result of political economy stories are theoretically \ninteresting, but empirically invalid. \nAnother question concerns what happens with other measures of urban concentration. \nWe have experimented with the Gini index, the normalized Herfindahl concentration \nindex and the coefficient of variation as dependent variables. These measures reflect \ndifferent aspects of dispersion and are defined at the country level. The coefficient of \nvariation, a standard measure of dispersion, averages the squared deviations from the \nmean and then divides by the mean. The normalized Herfindahl concentration index \nreflects squared normalized city sizes. The Gini coefficient is the mean absolute deviation \namong all pairs of cities, relative to the mean city size. Table 5 reports results for the \ncoefficient on telephone lines for the same eight specifications that appear in Table 2. \nRemarkably for such different measures of dispersion, the results for the coefficients of \ntelephones line per capita with the Gini and Herfindahl indices as dependent variables are \n\u2013 up to a scale factor \u2013 very similar to the two-step using Zipf (although just statistically \ninsignificant in column [8]). The coefficient estimates with the coefficient of variation as \na dependent variable are also negative and thus consistent with our findings using the Zipf \ncoefficient. It is worth recalling, however, that our choice of Zipf coefficient as a measure \nfor urban concentration is not arbitrary, being driven instead by a desire to link our \nempirical results firmly with our theoretical model of urban structure. In contrast, while \nall three of these alternative measures of urban concentration appear intuitive, when \nestimated on the truncated sample of larger cities they are not consistent estimators of the \npopulation variables and cannot be linked to our theoretical prediction of decreasing \nvariance for all cities. For this reason, the Zipf coefficient results represent our preferred \nspecification and we take these robustness checks as broadly consistent with our overall \nfindings.  \n12 These results are available on request and documented in the Data Appendix. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 21 \n \n7. Policy Discussion and Conclusion \nWe find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita lead to \na more concentrated distribution of city sizes and so correspondingly to more dispersion \nin the distribution of economic activity in space. The basic model that underlies our \napproach rationalizes this empirical result. As access to telephones improves, the ensuing \nchanges in city size distributions imply that local production externalities decrease. That \nresults in an urban structure that is less dependent on past shocks and hence a size \ndistribution of cities with smaller variance. This smaller variance is reflected in Zipf \ncoefficients that are larger in absolute value.  \nFigure 3 illustrates the magnitude of our empirical results (using column [8] in Table 2). \nIt assumes that the size distribution of city sizes is Pareto, that the smallest city has \n100000 inhabitants and plots the distribution for the average Zipf coefficient in our data \n(labelled \u2018actual\u2019 in the figure) and the distribution we would expect if the log of phone \nlines per capita increases by one standard deviation (all other effects are set to zero as this \nis just for illustration purposes). The figure also compares these two distributions with the \none associated with Zipf\u2019s law, that is, a Pareto distribution with coefficient minus one, \naccording to Equation (2). The increase in phone lines per capita concentrates the \ndistribution, by making the Zipf relationship steeper. If ICT improves, cities are not as \nlarge. For example, the share of cities with more than a million inhabitants is reduced by \n0.6 percentage points. Since the share of cities with populations larger than a million is \nabout 4.3%, this implies about a 14% decrease in the number of these large cities. This is \na significant change in urban structure! \nFigure 3. Effect of Phone Lines per Capita on the Size Distribution of Cities. \nAbout here \nWe argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban \nstructures once its use has spread more thoroughly through the different economies. So far \nthe evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. \nThe data suggest that as the number of internet users increases we should see effects that \nare about one tenth of the size of the ones we observe for phone lines. As we argue in the \nintroduction, massive internet adoption is a fairly recent phenomenon, and at least in so \nfar as our measurement of the extent of its adoption is concerned, urban structure may \ntake some time to adjust. This may explain the small coefficients we find in the data. \nWe find that public and private monopolies on average increase the number of phone \nlines per capita. An average country with a public monopoly will therefore have a more \nconcentrated size distribution of cities. These effects are also economically substantial. If \nthe average country with a public telephone monopoly transitions to a competitive \ntelecommunications sector, our results indicate that the change in the distribution of city \nsizes should be about a tenth of the change in Figure 3, but in the opposite direction. That \nis, the Zipf curve will become flatter as the number of larger cities increases. According to \nour calculations above, this change would lead to an increase of around 9% in the number \nof cities with more than a million residents. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 22 \n \nEven though the analysis in this paper allows us to derive conclusions about the effect \nof ICT on the urban structure, as it stands it is not designed to derive implications on \nwelfare. So far we can conclude that according to the theory above, ICT causes a decrease \nin the strength of intra-urban spillovers. That is, ICT reduces the importance of local \nfactors of production on the city's productivity and has led to the evolution of a more \nuniform distribution of cities. So far, it looks like ICT trades off spatial concentration of \neconomic activity for total factor productivity, and thus bears a conceptual similarity to \ninfrastructure and other regional policies, that are discussed by Martin (1999) and \nBaldwin et al. (2003), Ch. 17, and typically generate tradeoffs. However, increases in the \nscope (from urban to possibly regional, national or international) of spillovers or factor \ncomplementarities are likely to be associated with ICT as well. As the scope of \nexternalities increases, we should also expect increases in the growth rate of total factor \nproductivity everywhere. ICT implies not only smaller local spillovers but also larger \nnational or international spillovers. In this sense, ICT would behave more like the \u201cwin-\nwin\u201d policies discussed in ibid., p. 444.  In fact, if only the scope but not the average size \nof externalities changes, by construction ICT will lead to a welfare gain.  \nThis paper studies the first effect of ICT that leads to changes in the size distribution of \ncities. This effect by itself is likely to have a negative impact on welfare as it reduces the \nlocal externality. However ICT will also have the second effect, on spillovers at a larger \nspatial scope, which will not affect the distribution of economic activity in space, but is \nlikely to have important implications for the growth of aggregate total factor productivity \nover time. This effect will have positive effects on welfare. In order to understand the \nultimate welfare effects of ICT, one needs to account for both the local and national or \ninternational effects. As a first step, we have studied the local implications of ICT only. \nThe theory presented above implies that we can expect to see agents reallocating across \ncities as a result of improvements in ICT. Moreover, our empirical results imply both that \nthe reallocation that we have observed, and that will likely observe in the future, are \nsubstantial. Moving costs are also important and we have not commented on them so far \nin this paper. Some of these costs are due to regulation and lack of flexibility in labour \nmarkets. Others reflect frictions in the adjustment of urban public infrastructure. Yet other \ncosts are due to the cost of selling and buying homes, and the actual transport and \norganizational costs involved in moving across cities. Our results highlight the importance \nof government policy in reducing this type of costs. If moving costs are artificially high, \nbecause of government regulation and various types of interference, economies will not be \nable to take advantage of the gains associated with the ICT improvements, since agents \nwill not respond by redistributing themselves accordingly in space.  \nIt is imperative to allow for the natural reallocation that will result from further \nimprovements in ICT. After all, this reallocation across space is the adjustment by the \nindividuals and by firms to an economic environment where physical location is \nbecoming less important. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 23 \n \nREFERENCES  \nAdes, Alberto F., and Edward L.

In its strict version, which is also known as the rank-\nsize rule, the law is a deterministic rule that states that the second largest city is half the \nsize of the largest, the third largest city is a third of the size of the largest city, etc. To \nillustrate, let us take a country (for instance the US), and order its cities by population: \nNew York as the largest has rank 1, Los Angeles as the second largest has rank 2, etc. \nWe then draw a graph, known as Zipf\u2019s plot (see Fig. B.1): on the y-axis, we place the \nlog of the rank (New York has log rank ln1, Los Angeles log rank ln2); on the x-axis, the \nlog of the population of the corresponding city (which will be called the size of the city). \nIf the rank-size rule holds, this produces a downwards sloping line with slope equal to -1.  \nGenerally, and to a remarkable extent, statistical analyses for many different countries, \nas Gabaix (1999) emphasizes and Gabaix and Ioannides (2004) discuss in detail, obtain \nestimated coefficients that are concentrated often around one. This indicates that the size \ndistribution of cities is well approximated by Zipf's law with coefficient one. \nNevertheless, there is substantial variation in Zipf's coefficients across time and across \ncountries, a fact that ought to cause some doubts as to full validity of the law.  \nConsider the three Zipf plots on Fig. B.1. They look quite similar to one another, yet \nthe slopes of ordinary least squares lines fitted to them are not equal to -1.  Note that the \nplot for France is steeper than that for UK which in turn is steeper than that of the US; the \nrespective estimates are -1.55, -1.46, and -1.37, are all estimated with very high precision \nand using 96, 232 and 552 observations, respectively. Note also that the plot for the US is \nfurthest to the right because its cities are larger than those of the UK with the same rank, \nwhose plot in turn is further out than that of France, for the same reason. The techniques \nemployed in the main part of the paper are aimed at backing out from such differences \nthe effect of ICT across countries and over time. \nFigure B.1. Zipf's plots for three countries. \nAbout here. \n Can we obtain Zipf\u2019s law by means of theoretical arguments? The simplest direct \ntheoretical argument one could make would be by invoking Gibrat\u2019s law. If different \ncities grow randomly with the same expected growth rate and the same variance (Gibrat\u2019s \nLaw for means and variances of growth rate), then the limit distribution of city sizes \nconverges to Zipf \u2019s law. See Gabaix and Ioannides (2004) for an extensive discussion of \nthis issue. Empirically, on the other hand, Zipf\u2019s law for cities is an instance of a power \nlaw (see further below for details). Power laws are attractive in various sciences, \nespecially in physics, because they are \u201cscale free\u201d, in that they do not depend on the \ndefinitions of units of measurement. Naturally, this is an important concern in physics. \nRossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007) provide a rigorous justification for a power law that is \ndirectly rooted in economic theory. It follows as a special case of the model outlined in \nAppendix A. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 25 \n \nA power law of cities states that the proportion of cities that are greater than a \nparticular city of size , the counter-cumulative of the size distribution of cities, is of the S\nform:  \n( )\no\nSP s S\nS\n\u03b6\u239b \u239e> = \u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n, (B.1) \nwhere \u03b6 denotes a negative parameter, and  the lower boundary of the distribution, oS\nalso a parameter and itself a function of the various determinants of city sizes as \ndiscussed in the main body of the paper and Appendix A. The mean city size and the \nvariance associated with the law given by Equation (B.1), which is also known as a \nPareto probability distribution, are given by: \n2\n2\n01 ( 1) ( 2)\n{ } ; { } .oS E S S V S S\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u03b6 \u03b6+ + += = = o\u03b6  (B.2) \nThe mean is finite, if 1;\u03b6 >  the variance is finite, if 2.  Zipf\u2019s law is the case of \u03b6 >\na Pareto law with . 1\u03b6 = \u2212 These properties also help underscore that the rank-size rule \ncannot correspond to a reasonable probability distribution, strictly speaking, as such a \ndistribution would have neither a finite mean nor a finite variance.  \nWith these caveats, it is still interesting to note that with our data, reasonable good \nstatistical fits are obtained when we regress the log rank against log city size and a \nconstant, which is the so-called Zipf regression. Interestingly, for all country-year pairs \nwe strongly reject the null hypothesis that the Zipf coefficient is equal to minus one. In \nother words, we strongly reject Zipf\u2019s law, strictly construed.  \n\u201cEvery cloud has a silver lining,\u201d however. Starting from an empirical law, like Zipf\u2019s \nlaw, one may motivate a more general and far reaching inquiry into urban structure and \ngrowth and therefore on the determinants of city size distributions. This is what we have \nsought to do in this paper! \nOur use of the Zipf coefficient as a measure of dispersion in this paper is both original \nand may be easily defended on the basis of the properties of a power law for cities (B.2). \nSpecifically, the coefficient of variation, defined as standard deviation divided by the \nmean, is given by .5( \/(1 ))\u03b6 \u03b6+  , and is therefore a monotone increasing function of the \nZipf coefficient only. Similarly,  the Gini coefficient is given by  .5 1.\u03b6\u2212 +  \nWe think that rigorous research along the lines of our paper helps caution economists, \nsociologists, urban scientists and econophysicists against undue predictions. E.g., as \ngroups of countries integrate, like the EU, economic forces are unleashed which reshape \ntheir urban systems. What is likely to happen to the sizes of their larger cities and their \nranks? Zipf\u2019s law offers a straightforward prediction. But is it reliable? We think not, and \nhave instead proposed a way to make predictions that rely on underlying determinants of \ncity sizes in a dynamic world. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 26 \n \nAPPENDIX A: A Model of ICT, Urban Evolution and City Size Distributions \nWe illustrate how to study the role of ICT on the urban hierarchy by considering the basic \ntheoretical model in RHW. Total factor productivity, that is the level of technology, in \nindustry j  at time t  is given by  \nj j\ntj tj tj tjA A H N\n\u03b3 \u03b5=% % % , \nwhere tjH% and  denote the city's total employment and industry tjN% j  specific human \ncapital, and ln tjA  is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) productivity shock \nwith mean zero and variance \u03bd  across all industries j   and time periods  t. Thus \nparameters j\u03b3  and j\u03b5  determine the importance of knowledge spillovers from total \nemployment in industry j and industry j-specific human capital in the economy, which are \nexternal to individual firms in the industry but internal to the urban economy due to the \npresence of city developers. If both parameters j\u03b3  and j\u03b5 are equal to zero there are no \nexternal effects and economic activity has no incentive to agglomerate in cities. The larger \nboth of these parameters the more important are a city's total human capital and \nemployment in determining tjA% city-specific total factor productivity industry j. \nA very simple way to introduce the effect of ICT is therefore to let these two parameters \nvary with the quality of information technology, .\u03b9  Namely, let ( )j t\u03b3 \u03b9  where \n and, similarly, let ( ) \/j t t\u03b3 \u03b9 \u03b9\u2202 \u2202 0< ( )j t\u03b5 \u03b9  be such that ( ) \/j t t\u03b5 \u03b9 \u03b9 0\u2202 \u2202 < . Essentially, this \nassumption amounts to ICT\u2019s increasing the importance of agglomeration effects since \npeople located far away can now interact at a smaller cost and so people living in the city \nare less important in determining the city's productivity level. Conversely, we could \nassume that both ( )j t\u03b3 \u03b9  and ( )j t\u03b5 \u03b9  depend positively on the quality of ICT, which \nwould be consistent with arguments that emphasize the greater importance of public \ngoods as a result of changes in ICT. Which effect dominates is, ultimately, an empirical \nquestion that we try to settle in this paper. \nIn order for city sizes to be well defined, it will be clarified shortly below that we need \nto guarantee that the knowledge spillover parameters j\u03b3  and j\u03b5 satisfy ( ) ( ) 1 \/ 2j j\u03b3 \u03b9 \u03b5 \u03b9+ <  for all . Otherwise, cities would, in a sense, be too productive and \ntherefore would grow unboundedly since agglomeration effects would dominate \ncongestion costs at all population levels. As long as this condition is satisfied, as a city \ngrows eventually congestion costs become more important than agglomeration costs and \nso city sizes are finite.  \n\u03b9\nCities consist of a central business centre, where all agents work and all production is \nlocated, and residential areas surrounding it. Each agent consumes the services of one unit \nof land per period. For spatial equilibrium within each city agents should be indifferent \nabout where to live in the city. Therefore, equilibrium rents at a distance z from the centre \nshould obey ( )( )R z z z\u03c4= \u2212 , where z  denotes a city\u2019s radius, where rent is equal to 0. \nHence, total rents in a city of radius z  are given by  \n3\n23\n0\n2 ( )\n3 2\nz bTR zR z dz z N\u03c0\u03c4\u03c0= = =\u222b % . \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 27 \n \nsince everyone in the city lives in one unit of land, a city of population N~  and \n.3\/2 2\n1 \u03c4\u03c0\u2261 \u2212b  Total commuting costs are given by  \n3\n2\n0\n2\nz\nTCC z zdz bN\u03c0 \u03c4= =\u222b % .  \nAssuming the presence of city developers or governments that internalize city-wide \nexternalities, RHW show that in this framework the unique equilibrium allocation may be \nobtained as a solution to the following planning problem13: Choose state contingent \nsequences { } ,\n0, 1\n, , , , , ,\nJ\ntj tj tj tj tj tj tj t j\nC X N u K H\u03bc \u221e= =  to maximize \n0\n0 1\n(1 ) ln \/\nJ\nt\nt ti t\nt i\nE N C N\u03b4 \u03b4\u221e\n= =\n\u23a1 \u23a4\u239b \u239e\u2212 \u23a2 \u239c\u239d \u23a0\u23a3 \u23a6\u2211 \u2211 \u23a5\u239f  (A.1) \nsubject to, for all t  and , j\n3\n2\n1\n1\nj j j j j j\nj jtj tj tj tj\ntj tj tj tj tj tj\ntj tj tj tj\nN K H N\nC X b A u\n\u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b5\n\u03b1 \u03b2\u03bc \u03bc\u03bc \u03bc \u03bc \u03bc\n+ \u2212 \u2212 +\n\u2212 \u2212\u239b \u239e \u239b \u239e \u239b \u239e \u239b \u239e+ + \u2264\u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f\u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f \u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u23a0 \u239d \u23a0\n, (A.2) \n1\nJ\nt\nj\nN N\n=\n= \u2211 tj\nj\n, (A.3) \n1\n1\nj\nt j tj tjK K X\n\u03c9 \u03c9\u2212\n+ = , (A.4) \n0\n1 (1 )t j tj j tj j\n1H H B u B+ \u23a1= + \u2212\u23a3 \u23a4\u23a6 , (A.5) \nwhere:  and , ,tj tj tjN K X tjH denote total employment, total physical capital, physical \ncapital investment, and total human capital in industry in the economy and j j\u03b1 and j\u03b2  \nare positive parameters satisfying 0 1j j\u03b1 \u03b2< + < tjC;  denotes total consumption of \nrepresentative household i, and  the number of cities producing goods in industry tj\u03bc j ; \n denotes the fraction of time agent i devotes to work. Thus, the maximization problem \nabove amounts to maximizing the sum total of households\u2019 lifetime utilities, (A.1), \nsubject to: a resource constraint, Equation (A.2), which expresses that the use of resources \nfor consumption, investment, and commuting costs may not exceed current output (and \npresupposes that rents are redistributed back to the city residents); a labour market \nequilibrium condition, Equation (A.3), according to which the total labour force is \nallocated to all industries and all cities (free labour mobility); and the two factor \naccumulation equations, for physical and human capital. That is, respectively, Equation \n(A.4), according to which current investment and the existing capital stock produce \ncapital stock in the next period (with \ntju\nj\u03c9 being a parameter satisfying 0 1j\u03c9< < ), and \n                                                          \n13 RHW describe how to solve for an equilibrium in which some of the externalities are \nnot internalized by city planners or developers and, therefore, cities are inefficient. \nIndependently of the ability to internalize all potential urban externalities or not, this \nproblem can be solved using a pseudo-planner problem and in all cases yields results we \nunderscore in this paper. The main role that city developers or city governments play is \nto coordinate agents to work in the equilibrium number of cities. Land developers and \ncity governments traditionally have played this coordination role by offering guarantees \nand incentives to locate in a particular area.    \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 28 \n \nEquation (A.5), where human capital is augmented at a rate that depends on the portion of \neach individual\u2019s endowment of leisure not allocated for work.  \n  The problem of maximizing with respect to the number of cities tj\u03bc  is a static problem \nwith first order condition \n( ) 212 j j j j j j j j j jj jtj\ntj tj tj tj tj tj tj\ntj\nN\ns A K H N u\nb\n\u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b5 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b5\u03b3 \u03b5 \u03bc\u03bc\n+ \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u23a1 \u23a4+\u23a2 \u23a5= = \u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\n. \nSo the size of a city, , with core industry tjs j  is then given by  \n( ) ( )11 2 2\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\u02c6 \u02c62 \u02c6j j j j j j jj j\ntj j tj tj tj tj tjs F A H Kb\n\u03b3 \u03b5\n\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03c6\u03b3 \u03b5 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212\u23a1 \u23a4\u23a1 \u23a4+\u23a2\u23a2 \u23a5= \u23a2\u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\u23a2 \u23a5\u23a3 \u23a6\nN u \u23a5\u23a5 , (A.6) \nwhere the auxiliary variables \u02c6tjA , \u02c6 j\u03b1 , \u02c6 j\u03b2 ,and \u02c6j\u03c6  are defined as: \n( )11 2\u02c6 j j\ntj tjA A\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u2212 += , ( )\u02c6 1 2 j jj j j\n\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b5\n+= \u2212 + , \n( )\u02c6 1 2 jj j j\n\u03b2\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b5= \u2212 + , and ( )\n1\u02c6\n1 2\nj j\nj\nj j\n\u03b1 \u03b2\u03c6 \u03b3 \u03b5\n\u2212 \u2212= \u2212 + . \nGiven this log-linear specification, RHW show that capital investments and \nconsumption in each industry are constant fractions of output net of commuting costs, and \nthe fraction of time devoted to work  is constant across time.

This appendix reports these earlier \nresults for comparison. While the one-step procedure is more efficient, it is less intuitive \nand requires slightly stronger assumptions on the error term. \nIn the one-step procedure we substitute ct\u03b6\u02c6  from Equation (4) into equation (3) and \nestimate directly:  \n[ ]ict ct c ict ict ct ict ictR P t P X P\u03bb \u03b8 \u03b4 \u03b7\u2217 = + + + + e\u2217 , (5) \nwhere  is now composed of an i.i.d. error plus the interaction between \nrank and error from the first step, while all other coefficients and variables are as defined \nbefore. The interacted variable \nict ict ct icte e P\u03b5\u2217 = +\nct ictX P is instrumented by using the predicted values from \na regression of ct ictX P  on ct ictZ P  and the other exogenous explanatory variables (see \nWooldridge (2007, pp. 235) for why this is the correct approach). \nResults for telephones and internet usage per capita are reported in Tables 6 and 7 \nrespectively. Focusing only on our key variables of interest, we see that this one-step \nprocedure gives the same substantive effect of telephones and internet usage on urban \nstructure although the more efficient estimation procedure increases the significance of \nthe coefficients.  As the one-step estimation procedure requires stronger assumptions on \nthe error term, and as these particular empirical results do not correct for the resulting \ncomplicated error structure in (5), we view these results as placing an upper bound on the \nsignificance of the two core explanatory variables of the urban structure, telephone lines \nand internet users per capita. \nTHE EFFECT OF ICT ON URBAN STRUCTURE 31 \n \n \n \nFigure 1.
