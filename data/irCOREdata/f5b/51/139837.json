Oerther et al. (2001)\nhave characterized microbial foams generated on the surface of activated\nsludge as a viscous, deep brown\u2013 colored layer. Varley et al. (2004) have also\ncharacterized foam of a culture medium as \u2018a gas-liquid dispersion with gas\ncontent of more than 95%, produced due to intense agitation, aeration and the\npresence of surfactants\u2019. Based on the above statements, foams created in\nanaerobic digesters could be characterized as an accumulation of gas bubbles\nsurrounded by a liquid film on the surface of sludge.\nFoaming results in inefficient gas recovery from the digesters creating additional\ncosts for electricity production. Foaming can also result in an inverse solids\nprofile having higher solids concentrations at the top of a digester, creation of\ndead zones and reduction of the active volume of the digester hence resulting in\nsludge, which has not received the same degree of stabilization. Other\nproblems caused by foaming can include blockages of gas mixing devices,\nfoam binding of sludge recirculation pumps, fouling of gas collection pipes due\nto entrapped foam solids, foam penetration between floating covers and\ndigester walls and tipping of floating covers during foam expansion and\ncollapse. The economic issues that arise from energy loss, manpower overtime\n2and cleaning costs are of major concern to the wastewater industries (Pagilla et\nal. 1997, Westlund et al. 1998, Barjenbruch et al. 2000, Barber 2005). Westlund\net al. (1998) reported that a STW in Sweden suffered in 1996 from 40% biogas\nloss after a 10-week foaming incident. The total cost of suppressing foam,\nwhich included the additional oil consumption for energy production and the\nusage of polymer for improved dewatering, reached $150,000 US Dollars.\nHowever, this is the only reference found in the literature on costs arising from\nfoaming events in anaerobic digestion.\nA number of researchers have investigated the foaming problem in AD in order\nto identify the foaming causes. Initially, Ross and Ellis (1992) suggested that AD\nfoaming was related to organic overloading and the accumulation of acetic acid\nin digesters. According to a study conducted by Pagilla et al. (1997), Gordonia\nfilamentous bacteria were identified as the cause of foaming in two full scale\nanaerobic digesters at the Sacramento Regional STWs. A following study by\nWestlund et al. (1998) reported that Microthrix filamentous bacteria were the\nfoaming cause at a full scale anaerobic digester in Stockholm. Recent\nsuggestions, according to Barber (2005) and Barjenbruch et al. (2000), have\nidentified parameters, such as inadequate mixing, temperature fluctuations,\nshock loads, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and hydrophobic\nsubstances as foaming causes. However, the above reports do not represent a\nsystematic investigation of the foaming problem as the information provided is\neither site specific or lacks experimental evidence.\n3The present report aims to review the current knowledge on foaming causes in\nmesophilic AD and investigate the foaming mechanisms during AD. Wider\nknowledge of a well-studied foaming problem in biological processes, activated\nsludge (AS) foaming, is addressed in the following paragraphs in order to\npromote a better understanding regarding the mechanisms of foam formation\nand stabilization in biological processes where continuous degradation, solid\ncontents and the microbial population have an impact on foam initiation and\nstabilization and to provide useful information on understanding the\nmechanisms of foaming in AD. Comparison with the AS process was completed\nto: a) aim to potentially identify a relationship between AS foaming and AD\nfoaming; and b) study a more extensive literature on foam initiation and foaming\nmechanisms than available for AD. Foaming in other biological processes such\nas aerobic digestion (Staton et al. 2001) and up flow anaerobic sludge blankets\n(UASB) (Kalyuzhnyi et al. 1998) was not studied as there is little information in\nthe literature on foaming in such processes.\n2 Activated sludge foaming \u2013 The best studied\nexample\nThe activated sludge (AS) process is extensively used in wastewater treatment\nand involves the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms under\ndiffused or mechanical aeration (Metcalf and Eddy 2003). Foaming is a\nwidespread problem in AS plants and there is extensive information in the\nliterature on the foaming causes and control. This section aims at reviewing in\n4brief the well-studied foaming problem of AS plants in order to gain knowledge\nfrom the literature on wastewater foams and potentially recognize a relationship\nbetween AS foaming and AD foaming.\nFoaming in activated sludge plants is described as floating biomass and has\nbeen attributed by many researchers to the combination of the presence of\nsurfactants (detergents), biosurfactants (substances produced during the\nmetabolic activity of microorganisms) and the presence of two groups of\nfilamentous bacteria, Gordonia spp. (formerly known as Nocardia sp.) and\nMicrothrix parvicella. The filamentous microorganisms are generally bacteria,\nfungi and algae whose cells do not become detached from one another after\ncell division and therefore tend to grow in the form of \u2018filaments\u2019. Gordonia spp.\ncomprise of filamentous microorganisms, known as Actinomycetes, which are\nextremely hydrophobic due to the presence of mycolic acids on their cell walls\n(Stainsby et al. 2002, de los Reyes and Raskin 2002). Microthrix parvicella is\nalso hydrophobic and utilizes long chain fatty acids as carbon source. It can\nstore excess long chain fatty acids in large globules and has an advantage over\nother bacteria for water-insoluble fats and lipids due to its hydrophobicity\n(Mamais et al. 1998). The mycolic acids in their cell walls make them sufficiently\nhydrophobic and along with the morphological characteristics of filamentous\nbacteria they become attached on the gas bubbles present in activated sludge\nand rise to the surface of the liquid increasing the surface activity and promoting\nstable foams (Mamais et al. 1998, Eikelboom 2000, Oerther et al. 2001, de los\n5Reyes and Raskin 2002, Davenport and Curtis 2002, Torregrossa et al. 2005,\nCarr et al. 2006, Hug 2006, Kragelund et al. 2007).\nDe los Reyes and Raskin (2002) carried out batch tests involving the addition of\nGordonia amarae cells to AS and found that the threshold of Gordonia levels for\nfoam formation and foam stability were approximately 2x108 \u03bcm\/ml and 1x109\n\u03bcm\/ml (filament length), respectively. The results were verified by full scale and\nlaboratory scale measurements.\nDavenport and Curtis (2002) found that large rod and coccoid mycolata\nnumbers (mycolic-acid containing bacteria) varying from approximately 8x106 to\n30x106 per ml of AS and accounting for more than 79% of the mycolata\npopulation were highly associated with foaming events at three full-scale AS\nplants. However, branched filamentous mycolata presence in foaming periods\nwas insignificant, accounting for less than 21% of the mycolata population in the\nmixed liquor and foam samples examined. Furthermore, filamentous mycolata\ndid not contribute to any of the significant differences in mycolata concentration\nobserved between foaming and non-foaming periods. These findings indicated\nthat filamentous microorganisms were not the cause of foaming on this\noccasion.\nDe los Reyes et al. (2002) reported that large numbers of M. parvicella and\neven inactive M. parvicella cells were linked with foaming in AS. The length of\nM. parvicella in the monitored foaming AS plants varied from just above 0 \u00b5m\n6per ml to 2.6x109 \u00b5m per ml of AS. Hwang and Tanaka (1998) also stated that\nseasonal foaming at an activated sludge plant was attributed to increased levels\nof M.parvicella with persistent foaming corresponding to filament length\nbetween 200 and 500 \u00b5m.\nFoaming in AS plants is regarded as a 3-phase system, comprising of gas\nbubbles, liquid (wastewater) and solid particles (hydrophobic bacteria)\n(Davenport and Curtis 2002). Hug (2006) stated that the onset of foaming could\nbe due to high surfactants and biosurfactants loads in wastewater, which is then\nstabilized by the mycolic-acid containing microorganisms. Another study\ninvestigated the effect of three strains of the filamentous bacterium Gordonia\namarae on foam initiation and stabilization. Pure cultures of the three strains\nafter isolation of the microorganisms from foam or mixed liquor samples from\nfull scale showed that the agent responsible for foam initiation was the\nbiosurfactant produced during the exponential growth phase of the G.amarae\nstrains and not the G.amarae bacteria. It was also found that each strain\nproduced a different biosurfactant or at different quantities as the filtrates of\neach culture had different foaming behaviour. Although the biosurfactants were\nnot quantified in this study, their concentrations were measured indirectly\nthrough surface tension and the foaming potential and surface tension values\nbelow 60 mN.m-1 were necessary for foam initiation. The stabilization of foam\nwas attributed to the presence of G.amarae as \u226555% of the strains was\npartitioned into the foam resulting in reduction of the foam drainage rates. The\npartitioning of the bacteria in the foam was not associated with the origin of the\n7strains (foam or mixed liquor sample) and did not change greatly with the life\ncycle (Heard et al. 2008).\nIn conclusion, foaming in AS plants is a well-studied problem by many\nresearchers with significant impacts on the process efficiency. Several studies\nby various researchers have demonstrated a clear link between the AS foaming\nand the presence of surfactants, biosurfactants and the mycolic-acid containing\nmicroorganims. Recent studies (Hug 2006, Heard et al. 2008) have showed that\ninitiation of AS foaming is due to surfactants and biosurfactants, although critical\nconcentrations for foam initiation have not been quantified due to the numerous\ncompounds involved and their variability between different sludges. Foam\nstabilization is mainly due to the filamentous Gordonia and M.parvicella but\nthere is evidence suggesting that non filamentous mycolic-acid containing\nmicroorganisms, of which specific species have not yet been identified, also act\nas stabilizing agents. Additional information on the exact mechanisms of foam\ngeneration and stabilization in AS plants has not been provided potentially due\nto the complexity of the process (degradation pathways and numerous surface\nactive compounds present in wastewater).\n3 Anaerobic digestion foaming\nCurrent knowledge of the AS foaming problem has provided fundamental\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of wastewater foaming. In order to identify\n8similarities regarding the mechanisms of foam formation and stabilization in AD\nand potentially the relationship between AS foaming and AD foaming, the\nfollowing paragraphs evaluate the effect on foaming in relation to chemical\n(surface active agents) and microbiological components.\n3.1 Surface active agents\nThe term \u2018surface active agents\u2019 refers to substances that are either surfactants\nor bio-surfactants. The surfactants include oil, grease, volatile fatty acids,\ndetergents, proteins and particulate matter (Vardar-Sukan 1998, Westlund et al.\n1998, Barber 2005). However, the term \u2018particulate matter\u2019 as found in the\nliterature is not clearly stated and can lead to confusion and misinterpretations.\nThe particulate matter involves potentially the inorganic components of sludge,\noften referred to as grit, such as metals, sand and generally indigestible\nmaterial that accumulates at the bottom of digesters. The term biosurfactants\nrefers to substances produced during the metabolic activity of microorganisms\nfound in sludge, such as hydroxylated and cross-linked fatty acids, glycolipids,\nproteins, lipoproteins, phospholipids and polysaccharide-lipid complexes\n(Kosaric 1992, Ron and Rosenberg 2002, Nitschke and Pastore 2006).\nSurface active agents have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. The\nhydrophobic ends of surface active agents tend to move towards the air phase,\nbeing forced out of the solution due to their hydrophobicity. The hydrophilic\nends, on the contrary, tend to move towards the liquid phase. Surface active\n9agents have an impact on the surface tension of a solution, where surface\ntension is defined as \u2018a property of liquids arising from unbalanced molecular\ncohesive forces at or near the surface, as a result of which the surface tends to\ncontract and exhibit properties resembling those of a stretched elastic\nmembrane\u2019 (Dictionary of the English Language 2000). The examination of\nsurface tension against the concentration of a surface active compound\nidentifies its critical micelle concentration (cmc). That is the concentration of the\ncompound at which the aggregation of molecules into clusters (micelles) starts\nby orientation of the hydrophobic ends of the molecules towards the centre and\nthe hydrophilic ends towards the solution. At concentrations lower than the cmc,\nthe molecules of the compound exist as monomers, whereas at concentrations\nhigher than the cmc as micelles (Elmitwalli et al. 2001, Ying 2006). According to\nSchramm (2000), the effect of the compound is greatest at concentrations\nhigher than the cmc where a significant number of micelles are present. Simply,\nthe cmc of a surface active compound determines the concentration beyond\nwhich surface activity increases and foaming would appear if air bubbles were\nintroduced into solution. The surface tension of pure water is approximately 72\nmN.m-1 at 20 oC (Vardar-Sukan 1998) and there is extensive information in the\nliterature referring to the effect of individual compounds on surface tension and\ntheir critical micelle concentrations. Clarkson et al. (1999), for instance, reports\nthat the apparent cmc of the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) is 0.03mg.ml-\n1. Nino and Patino (1998) identify the cmc of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene\nsorbitan monolaurate) at 1.69M x105. Garcia et al. (2006) identify the cmc of\nlinear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) as decreasing with increasing alkyl chain\n10\nlength of the LAS homologue (1.5M *10-3 \u2013 2.0M *10-5). Further examples of the\neffect of specific compounds on surface tension are given in the following\nparagraphs.\nAll the above mentioned surface active agents, i.e. oil, grease, volatile fatty\nacids (VFAs), detergents, proteins and products from the metabolic activity of\nmicroorganisms are largely present in anaerobic digesters (Gerardi 2003).\nHowever, it is known that these substances break down in a digester into\nsmaller and simpler compounds. A better look into the degradation pathways\nand the by-products of these compounds during anaerobic digestion could\nprovide further understanding of the impact of surface active agents on foaming\nduring AD.\nProteins are complex compounds with high molecular weights, that can vary\nfrom 14.6kD to 250kD based on a report by Clarkson et al. (1999) and they do\nnot dissolve or settle in wastewater. In sludge, they are found in solution as\nsoluble microbial products but also attached to the solid particles as\nextracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Due to the size of proteins,\nmicroorganisms produce exoenzymes (proteases or peptidases) to break down\nthe proteins into smaller compounds (amino acids) and subsequently absorb\nthem into their cells to utilize the carbon source. Amino acids are converted to\norganic acids once inside the cells, which are then released along with\nammonia into the bulk phase. Organic acids are the substrate for methane\n11\nforming bacteria and as digestion proceeds CH4 and CO2 are produced (Gerardi\n2003).\nProteins have been recognized as foam forming agents by many researchers\nand the cmcs\u2019 of many proteins are available in the literature (Khan and Forster\n1990, Clarkson et al. 1999, Glinski et al. 2000, Rouimi et al. 2005, Foegeding et\nal. 2006, Glaser et al. 2007). Khan and Forster (1990) conducted aeration tests\nwith a non-foaming AS to determine the impact of a protein in the foaming\npotential of AS. The protein used in the experiments was bovine serum\nalbumen (BSA) at concentration of 2 g.l-1. Khan and Forster (1990) reported\nthat BSA induced foam in AS under aeration, however, with low stability.\nVardar-Sukan (1998) stated that proteins exhibit their lowest solubility and\nhighest foaming potential at their isoelectric point, which is highly dependant on\nthe pH of the medium. So far no information is available in the literature on how\ndifferent proteins affect the foaming potential in anaerobic digesters and what\nconcentrations are critical above which foaming is induced. There is indication\nfrom the experiments conducted by Khan and Foster (1990) that BSA would\ninduce foaming in digester feed sludge under aeration. However, proteins are\nbroken down to amino acids in anaerobic digesters by exoenzymes and their\nimpact on the foaming potential is reduced. Gonzales et al. (2003) found that\nthe protein content in AD was less biodegradable than fiber and lipids and that\nthere was a final equilibrium concentration value of 8.41 mg.g-1 for each non-\nfoaming sludge that was independent of the initial protein concentration. The\nmaximum initial protein concentration tested in this study was 44.8% of dry\n12\nmatter of sludge. Accumulation of proteins at the air\/liquid interface could be\nfacilitated during AD due to their surface active properties, which could then\nlead to enhanced foaming potential. On the other hand, the interaction of\nproteins with other proteins, solids and other compounds in solution could also\naffect the behavior of proteins, such as the electrostatic interactions reported by\nGlaser et al. (2007) between BSA and protamine resulting in a molecular double\nlayer entrapping liquid, which reduced drainage thus increasing foam stability.\nOther types of interaction include the affinity of proteins to fat, as described by\nEisner et al. (2007), in the protein \u2013 fat mixture containing 9.75% molten butter\n(82% fat content), 11.3% spray dried skim milk powder (low heat), 12% sugar,\n4% glucose syrup solids, 0.1% locust bean gum and 0.1% guar gum by weight,\nwhich resulted in bridging between adjacent foam bubbles and between\nbubbles and the bulk solution resulting in reduced foam drainage and hence the\ncreation of more stable foams. However, it was demonstrated in the same\nreport that the presence of nonionic emulsions of monolaurate (0.9 \u00b5M),\nmonooleate (0.7 \u00b5M) and trioleate of sorbitan (0.3 \u00b5M) in the protein \u2013 fat matrix\nreduced the foaming potential and stability. Investigation of the effect of\nproteins, the proteins by-products, the interactions between compounds and\npotentially the production of exoenzymes that could affect the foaming potential\nin anaerobic digesters is complex and can vary between different sludges. So\nfar, it is unknown whether sludge containing very surface active proteins, such\nas lysozome of which 0.001mM reduced the surface tension of aqueous\nsolution to below 58 mN.m-1, as it was demonstrated by Clarkson et al. (1999),\nwould be more likely to foam during AD compared to sludge containing less\n13\nsurface active proteins and hence provide an indication of sludge streams more\nprone to foaming or if the presence of proteins independent of their surface\nactivity is adequate to contribute to \/ result in foaming.\nVolatile acids are a group of organic acids, often described as volatile fatty\nacids (VFAs). They can vary in length but generally are low molecular weight\n(MW) compounds, soluble in water and sludge. Seven of the commonest fatty\nacids found in anaerobic digesters are formic acid (HCOOH, MW: 46.03), acetic\nacid (CH3COOH, MW: 60.05), propionic acid (CH3CH2COOH, MW:74.08),\nbutyric acid (CH3(CH2)2COOH, MW:88.10), valeric acid (CH3(CH2)3COOH,\nMW:102.13), iso-valeric acid ((CH3)2CHCH2COOH, MW:102.13) and caproic\nacid (CH3(CH2)4COOH, MW:116.15). The ranges of the above acids in\ndigesters usually vary between 50 and 300 mg.l-1 as total VFAs concentration.\nAcetic acid is the predominant acid and accounts for approximately 85% of the\nvolatile acids content in an anaerobic digester (Metcalf and Eddy 2003, Gerardi\n2003). Accumulation of acetic acid has been identified in the literature as a\nfoaming cause by many researchers (Pagilla et al. 1997, Westlund et al. 1998,\nBarjenbrugh et al. 2000). This is understandable as methanogenic bacteria are\nthe only bacteria that utilize acetic acid and they are characterized by slow\ngrowth rates (they can reproduce within 3 days at 35oC according to Handbooks\nof UK Wastewater Practise (1996) and Gerardi (2003)), which indicates that\nfluctuations resulting in excess acetic acid concentrations in an anaerobic\ndigester would result in degradation of only the maximum uptake of acetic acid\nby the methanogens with the remaining acetic acid lowering the pH of the\n14\ndigester and inhibiting the digestion process. However, there is no experimental\nor quantitative evidence in the literature to support the above interpretation that\naccumulation of acetic acid leads to foaming in AD and the critical concentration\nof acetic acid in sludge beyond which digestion inhibition and potentially\nfoaming occurs is unknown.\nLipids are extremely hydrophobic organic molecules that do not dissolve in\nwater. Due to their hydrophobicity, lipids are attached to the solid particles in\nsludge. The most common lipids in municipal and industrial wastewater, and\nsubsequently in sludge are fats and oils. Fats and oils that enter a digester,\nalthough surface active agents as previously stated, are hydrolyzed to simpler\ncompounds (glycerol and fatty acids) to give ultimately organic acids (Gerardi\n2003). Fats and oils are mainly present in primary sludge at concentrations\nbetween 6.4 to 14.8% of dry matter but can also be detected in digesters and\nSAS in smaller concentrations (digesters: 2.4 \u2013 9.0%, SAS: 0.8 \u2013 2.52% of dry\nmatter) (Gonzales et al. 2003). Gonzales et al. (2003) found that lipids were\nutilized by microorganisms in AD faster than proteins and similarly, there was a\nfinal equilibrium concentration value of 1.07 mg.g-1 for each sludge tested that\nwas independent of the initial lipid concentration. Given the hydrophobicity of\nlipids but also their degradability during AD, it is not clear whether lipids would\npotentially accumulate on the surface of the bulk phase in an anaerobic\ndigester, losing contact with the majority of bacteria found in the bulk phase and\nhence leading to partial degradation of fats and oils and increased surface\nactivity. The biogas bubbles could become entrapped due to the surface active\n15\nproperties of the lipids and potentially induce foaming. However, additional\nexperimental data demonstrating a clear contribution of lipids to the sludge\u2019s\nfoaming potential during AD were not found in the literature. There is indication\nthat lipids contribution to foaming in AD is potentially smaller than the proteins\ncontribution due to the low degradability of proteins and accumulation of lipids\nat the air\/liquid interface resulting in increases surface activity could be\neliminated by maintaining a well mixed homogenous digester.\nDetergents are another group of compounds recognized as surface active\nagents. Detergents present in wastewater derive from industrial effluents, such\nas breweries, dairies, paper and textile industries but also from municipal\nwastewater. Industrial effluents can significantly increase the concentrations of\ndetergents that enter a STWs to such an extent that they can inhibit biological\ntreatment processes (Leitao et al. 2006). The most important group of\ndetergents is the linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS). LAS are characterized\nas anionic surfactants and are the most frequently used world wide in both\ndomestic and industrial applications. It has been found by Jensen (1999) that a\nlarge amount of LAS is adsorbed onto the particles and organic matter of sludge\nand is removed from the wastewater via primary sludge. Due to the high\ndegradability of LAS under aerobic conditions, primary sludge is the only stream\nthat will contain substantial detergent concentrations. However, the amount of\nLAS in the final sludge (mixture of primary and secondary sludge) is highly\ndependant on the site processes. (Table 1 shows the concentrations of LAS\nfound in sludge derived from different STWs)\n16\nPrats et al. (1997) examined the removal of anionic (LAS) and nonionic\ndetergents in wastewater treatment plants. The findings from this study\nrevealed that during sludge settling and subsequently anaerobic digestion of\nsludge, the degradation of the nonionic detergents was 27% and only 7% for\nLAS. Jensen\u2019s (1999) finding that detergents are adsorbed onto the solids and\norganic matter is also supported by Prats et al. (1997) who showed that most of\nthe detergent was removed by attachment to the suspended solids. According\nto Petrovic and Barcelo (2004), LAS concentrations in sewage sludge can\nrange from 100 mg kg-1 to 30 g kg-1 and are highly dependant on the site\nprocesses. In the same report, it is also stated that LAS concentrations in\nsludges obtained from three STWs in Spain were in the range of 8.4\u201314.0 mg.g-\n1 (average 12.6 mg\/g) and 12.1\u201318.8 mg.g-1 (average 15.8 mg.g-1) before and\nafter digestion, respectively. However, it is not stated in the report whether\nfoaming was recorded in the digesters of the STWs in Spain. Along with LAS,\nPetrovic and Barcelo (2004) examined other groups of detergents such as\nNPEOsn (nonylphenol ethoxylates, n: 1 \u2013 15) and AEOs (alcohol ethoxylates)\nand found that significant amounts of short-chain NPEOs and AEOs are also\nretained during anaerobic digestion. Typically, they mentioned that NPEOs\nconcentrations range from a few mg\/kg to over 500mg\/kg, and for AEOs, which\nare the second most widely used surfactants worldwide, maximum\nconcentrations can reach 300mg\/kg and removal efficiencies range from 33% to\n86% during AD. The low removal of detergents during AD, especially for the\nanionic detergents, along with their properties as surface active agents results\n17\nin increased surface activity in sludge that could potentially contribute to\nfoaming events in AD.\nThe information found in the literature for biosurfactants in sewage sludge, such\nas glycolipids, lipoproteins, phospholipids, polysaccharide-lipid complexes and\ntheir association to foaming is limited, potentially due to the numerous and\ncomplex compounds present and the variability of these compounds between\ndifferent sludges. Indirect biosurfactants measurements have been conducted\nby researchers in wastewater, soil or other bacterial culture media samples\n(Pirog et al. 2003, Verma et al. 2006, Nitschke and Pastore 2006). Nitschke and\nPastore (2006) conducted surface tension measurements in a wastewater\nbased culture medium of a bacterial species to monitor the biosurfactants\nproduction. The biosurfactant, which was identified as a lipopeptide, reduced\nthe surface tension of the culture medium to 26 mN.m-1 at concentration of 3g.l-1\nwhile its cmc was 33 mg.l-1. The large and diverse microbial population in\nanaerobic digesters would suggest that the production of biosurfactants in\ndigesters is significant. However, biosurfactants are present in AD under non-\nfoaming conditions. It is not clear whether an upset in the metabolic activity of\nmicroorganisms in AD is necessary to result in higher production of\nbiosurfactants that would facilitate foaming. Therefore, biosurfactants might not\nbe a direct AD foaming cause but an effect of an underlying cause that triggers\nthe production of biosurfactants. Additionally, the likelihood of these compounds\nto induce foaming in a digester would probably depend on the type of\nbiosurfactants present and their concentrations. No conclusion can be made at\n18\nthis stage for the contribution of biosurfactants in AD foaming due to lack of\nexperimental evidence.\nIn summary, a large number of compounds commonly found in anaerobic\ndigesters are surface active. The impact of surface active agents on AD\nfoaming depends on the properties of each compound. The literature has\nsuggested that the effect of proteins in a digester is greater as they are less\nbiodegradable than lipids and fiber. Accumulation of acetic acid has been\nsuggested as a foaming cause with no supporting experimental evidence and\nanionic detergents presence in AD is significant due to their low degradability\nunder anaerobic conditions. During digestion, however, two major factors need\nto be taken into consideration a) interactions between compounds and between\nthe compounds and solids in sludge could enhance or reduce the foaming\npotential, as discussed in previous paragraphs and b) the surface active agents\nare broken down to simpler compounds (organic acids) during AD and are\nutilized by the bacteria and therefore their impact on the foaming potential is\nunclear. Unstable digestion, however, such as accumulation of acetic acid and\nits partial utilization by the methanogens, as explained earlier, or accumulation\nof proteins and detergents due to their low degradability during AD, could\ninitiate or contribute to foaming. Therefore, it is necessary to determine\nquantitatively or qualitatively, i.e. through surface tension measurements (Pirog\net al. 2003, Verma et al. 2006, Nitschke and Pastore 2006) or aeration tests\n(Khan and Forster 1990), as previously done by other researchers, the critical\n19\nconcentrations of surface active agents necessary to induce and \/ or stabilize\nfoaming during AD.\n3.2 Filamentous microorganisms\nA number of reports in the literature have identified Gordonia species and\nMicrothrix parvicella as the cause of foaming in AD (Pagilla et al. 1997,\nWestlund et al. 1998, Moen 2003, Barber 2005). However, there is no\ndifferentiation between foam initiation causes and foam stabilization causes\nwhen referring to the above filamentous species. Gordonia species and\nMicrothrix parvicella are present in anaerobic digesters via surplus activated\nsludge (SAS). They can be present in the liquid phase but also bound to the\nflocs. Although, they are primarily aerobic organisms, literature has shown that\nthey can survive under anaerobic conditions, as discussed in following\nparagraphs. Their hydrophobic properties tend to drive the filamentous\nmicroorganisms towards the air\/liquid interface as the microorganisms become\nattached to the biogas bubbles. The accumulation of filamentous\nmicroorganisms on the air\/liquid interface of anaerobic digesters along with the\npotential of biosurfactants production, results in lower surface tension of sludge\nand enhanced foaming potential (Eikelboom 2000, Barber 2005).\nHernandez and Jenkins (1994) studied the fate of Gordonia during mesophilic\nanaerobic digestion of sludge. Severe foaming was induced at laboratory scale\nbatch digestion experiments at concentrations of Gordonia spp. between 0.05-\n20\n0.1 g Gordonia \/ g total solids. That concentration matched the range of g\nGordonia per g total solids observed at full scale digesters that experienced\nfoaming. Hernandez and Jenkins (1994) reported that, although Gordonia spp.\nare known to be obligate aerobes, they survived under anaerobic conditions\nwith only 37% filament reduction at a 14-day SRT and 60% of these filaments\ncapable of respiration after 14 days. Another interesting finding was that viability\nof Gordonia spp. decayed more slowly in single-phase digestion than in two-\nphase with a first order rate coefficient for single-phase digestion of 0.02 \/ day.\nMamais et al. (1998) supported these findings by stating that Microthrix is\ncapable of surviving under anoxic and \/ or anaerobic conditions.\nWestlund et al. (1998) monitored the presence and abundance of filaments\nduring an anaerobic digester foaming incident at the full scale. Filaments were\nidentified microscopically in the foam and bulk phase of sludge. The dominant\nspecies of filaments was recognized as Microthrix parvicella. Table 2 lists the\ncharacteristics of the sludge and foam samples obtained from the digester\nduring foaming and compares them with sludge characteristics obtained from\nthe same digester when foaming was not recorded. Westlund et al. (1998)\ncarried out laboratory tests with samples obtained from the foam phase of the\ndigester. The foam samples were collected in a glass vessel and the potential to\nforce the foam sample to foam again was tested by shaking the glass vessel.\nThe foam sample collapsed, when shaking the glass vessel, to produce sludge\nand it was not possible to foam again. Microthrix filaments were found attached\nto the gas bubbles in the foam samples after microscopic examination.\n21\nAccording to Westlund et al. (1998) it was concluded that Microthrix was bound\nto the gas bubbles during digestion producing the foam. The binding between\nthe gas bubbles and the filaments was strong in order not to release the gas\nduring digestion and only by shaking the foam the gas bubbles could be\nreleased and foam could be destroyed.\nPagilla et al. (1997) also monitored the levels of filaments along with other\noperational data of two full scale anaerobic digesters for a period of 10 months.\nFoaming was recorded in the digesters during the period of sampling. The two\ndigesters were operated under the same conditions but one of them was\nmechanically mixed and the other gas mixed. The presence of excessive levels\nof Gordonia in the feed sludge (up to 107 numbers per gram VSS) coincided\nwith an increase of the foam layer with a more pronounced effect in the gas\nmixed digester.\nSoddell and Seviour (1995) determined the ability of mainly Nocardia and other\nfilament species to grow in a wide temperature range. The filaments were\nisolated from foaming activated sludge and cultivated in laboratory conditions at\ndifferent temperatures. The majority of the filaments species examined could\ngrow in cultures in the mesophilic range of 30-35o C, indicating that the\ntemperature in mesophilic AD would have no adverse impacts in filaments\ngrowth. A major factor that needs to be taken into consideration is that in cases\nof foaming in mesophilic AD, the temperature in the foam matrix is lower than\n22\nthe temperature in the bulk phase, which, according to the study of Soddell and\nSeviour (1995), favors the growth of more species in the foam matrix.\nAccording to the information provided above, Gordonia and Microthrix are the\nspecies that have been found to induce foaming in AD. The same species were\nfound responsible for AS foaming. The findings of Hernandez and Jenkins\n(1994) clearly demonstrated at both full and laboratory scale that concentrations\nbetween 0.05-0.1 g Gordonia \/ g total solids resulted in severe foaming during\nAD. However, two different species of filaments were identified as the causative\nfoaming agent at full scale digesters in the reports by Pagilla et al. (1997) and\nWestlund et al. (1998). Earlier in this section, knowledge on AS foaming was\nreviewed in order to identify potential similarities between AS and AD foaming.\nRecent publications on AS foaming have shown that it is the biosurfactants\nproduction by Gordonia spp and Microthrix and potentially other mycolata that\ninitiate foaming but the bacteria that stabilize it. So far, only the presence and\nabundance of these species has been investigated in relation to AD foaming\nand not the biosurfactants production. There is evidence that the reduction in\nfilament numbers in AD is small and hence the production of biosurfactants by\nthese species could still occur during AD indicating the same foaming\nmechanisms in both AS and AD. Investigation of the impact of other filament\nspecies with similar morphological characteristics (i.e. hydrophobicity due to\nmycolic acids) on foaming in AD would provide useful information about the\nextent filaments are responsible for foaming.\n23\n3.3 Temperature\nDohanyos et al. (2004) stated that thermophilic digestion is more resistant to\nfoam generation than mesophilic digestion. This could be attributed to the effect\nof higher temperatures on lowering the surface tension and viscosity of sludge\nand hence increasing foam drainage (Hayta et al. 2001, Barber 2005).\nThermophilic digestion, therefore, could be effective in foam minimization and\/or\ndestruction where foam is constantly present.\nAnother factor that needs to be taken into consideration when investigating the\nrelationship between temperature and foaming, are temperature fluctuations\ndue to technical site failures. The only experimental evidence on the effect of\ntemperature fluctuations during anaerobic digestion is provided by Chae et al.\n(2008), who studied the AD of swine manure and showed that a temperature\ndecrease and subsequent increase from 35oC to 30oC to 32oC affected only the\nbiogas yield. No reference to foaming was found in the report during the\ndigestion period. According to Chae et al. (2008), the temperature was lowered\nfrom 35oC to 30oC during digestion and maintained for 170 hours. However, the\nbiogas production rate resumed to the values of the control after 40 hours of the\nchange. Similarly, the temperature change from 30oC to 32oC and subsequent\ndigestion period of approximately 200 hours showed a temporary decrease in\nbiogas yield, which again matched the control values after about 40 hours of the\nchange. The effect of temperature fluctuations greater than the ones studied by\nChae et al. (2008) to the metabolic activity of microorganisms in AD, which\ncould lead to accumulation of surface active agents due to the microbial upset\n24\nand poor digestion and potentially foaming has not been reported in the\nliterature.\n3.4 Organic loading\nA number of researchers have stated that organic overloading of digesters can\nbe a cause of foaming (Pagilla et al. 1997, Barjenbrugh et al. 2000, Brown\n2002, Moen 2003, Barber 2005). This could be due to the excess of compounds\nnot being fully degraded by the bacteria within digesters, leading potentially to\naccumulation of hydrophobic or surface active by-products that would promote\nfoaming. According to the literature, the typical ranges of organic (volatile solids,\nVS) loading rates for conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion of municipal\nsludge, as shown in Table 3, can vary greatly from values as low as 0.7kg\nVS.m-3 d-1 up to 7.2kg VS.m-3 d-1. Brown (2002) suggests that operating\ndigesters at organic loading rates higher than 4.5kg VS.m-3 d-1, even though\nthey are still within the suggested operational range according to Table 3,\nusually results in foaming. None of the other reports found in the literature\nprovide quantitative information to support the above statements. Hence,\nalthough organic loading is put forward as a foaming cause by many\nresearchers, there is still lack of fundamental information to demonstrate a clear\ncorrelation between foaming and organic loading of digesters. Given that sludge\ncharacteristics can be different between digesters, it could be possible that each\ndigester has a critical organic loading threshold above which foaming appears.\n25\n3.5 Mixing and digester shape\nMixing aims to achieve optimum process performance by keeping the bulk\nphase in a digester in suspension and in full contact with the bacterial\npopulation (Metcalf and Eddy 2003). Mixing is therefore critical to avoid the\ncreation of dead zones and a corresponding reduction of the active volume of\nthe digester (short-circuiting of sludge). Pagilla et al. (1997) studied foaming in a\ngas-mixed and a mechanically-mixed digester receiving the same feed and\noperated under similar conditions (loading, temperature etc.) and stated that the\ngas-mixed digester accumulated more foam than the mechanically-mixed\ndigester. It is believed that gas mixing provides favorable conditions for foam\ngeneration due to the presence of bubbles in the bulk phase that promote\nattachment of the surface active and hydrophobic compounds found in sludge\nonto the bubbles. As the bubbles rise to the surface of the liquid in digesters,\nthe surface active and hydrophobic compounds form a liquid film around the\nbubbles that prohibits the bubbles from bursting, increases the surface activity\nand results in higher foaming potential. Barber (2005) also identifies gas mixing\nsystems as an operational cause of AD foaming while Moen (2003) reports that\nfine bubble gas mixing systems are considered as a cause of foaming for AD.\nApart from the effect of the type of mixing on foaming, poor and excessive\nmixing have also been suggested as foaming causes (Pagilla et al. 1997, Brown\n2002, Moen 2003). However, due to lack of supporting information, it can only\nbe assumed that poor mixing in a full scale anaerobic digester would result in\nsolid \/ liquid phase separation, accumulation of surface active substances due\n26\nto poor degradation at the air \/ liquid interface resulting in increased surface\nactivity and potentially foaming. On the other hand, excessive mixing increases\nthe amount of bubbles in the bulk phase enhancing the attachment of surface\nactive and hydrophobic compounds, increasing the surface activity and\npotentially inducing foaming either in the form of excessive gas mixing or by\nformation of gas bubbles when the total dissolved gas pressure exceeds the\nlocal solution pressure as a result of excessive mechanical mixing (Scardina\nand Edwards 2006).\nIn addition, several advantages and disadvantages have been identified\nbetween different digester shapes, according to the literature. Cylindrical\ndigesters have a greater surface area compared to egg-shaped digesters\nallowing larger volumes of gas to be stored and facilitating the accumulation of\nscum and foam. On the other hand, egg-shaped digesters have a very limited\nsurface area above the bulk phase of the digester reducing the scum and foam\naccumulation potential. Poor mixing and grit accumulation has been observed in\ncylindrical digesters creating dead spaces and short circuit of sludge whereas\nfor egg-shaped digesters this is claimed to be reduced. Clearly, cylindrical\ndigesters are more commonly used due to the cost implications of egg-shaped\ndigesters but no information so far has suggested that egg-shaped digesters\ncan prevent foaming occurrence (Metcalf and Eddy 2003).\nIn summary, mixing along with digester shape play an important role in\nanaerobic digestion efficiency. There is evidence suggesting that gas mixing\n27\nand excessive mixing contribute to foaming but there will have to be critical\nconcentrations of surface active material in a digester that would attach to the\ngas bubbles, prolong the bubbles life and hence result in foaming. On the other\nhand, failure to maintain sufficient mixing during digestion results in stratification\nand short-circuiting of sludge potentially affecting the microbial activity due to\nsubstrate availability. Under these conditions surface active agents and other\nnon-degraded hydrophobic material could rise to the surface of the bulk phase\nin a digester and potentially induce foaming. It is crucial, therefore, to monitor\nthe mixing efficiency in full scale digesters and investigate any relation of\nfoaming occurrence to inadequate mixing.\n4 Discussion\nAD foaming is currently a recognized operational problem with severe impacts\non the performance of STWs. Part of the current paper reviewed knowledge on\nAS foaming in order to apply the current understanding of an extensively\nstudied area to AD foaming and potentially recognize a relationship between\nfoaming in AS and foaming in AD. According to the literature, the onset of\nfoaming in AS plants has been related to increased surfactant and biosurfactant\nconcentrations. However, their critical concentrations for foam initiation have not\nbeen identified due to the numerous compounds involved and the variability\nbetween different sludges. Nonetheless, foam stabilization has been attributed\nto the presence of mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes and the filamentous\nMicrothrix parvicella. Detailed information on the exact foaming mechanisms in\n28\nAS has not been found due to the complexity of the process. Yet, according to\nDavenport and Curtis (2002), foaming in AS plants is regarded as a 3-phase\nsystem comprising of gas bubbles, liquid (wastewater containing surface active\nagents responsible for foam initiation) and solid particles (hydrophobic bacteria\nresponsible for foam stabilization).\nA detailed investigation of the operational parameters of AD including gas\nmixing, temperature fluctuations, organic loading, and digester shape and their\nrelationship to foaming indicated that these parameters could potentially create\nfavorable conditions for foam initiation in anaerobic digesters. It is therefore\nimportant to ensure that operation of anaerobic digesters is not going to\nfacilitate foam generation. Parameters that can be controlled by operators on a\ndaily basis can involve minimizing temperature fluctuations that could lead to\npoor digestion and potential accumulation of surface active compounds, either\nas by-products of digestion or as found in the feed sludge. Ensuring sufficient\nbut not excessive mixing by maintaining digesters regularly and preventing grit\naccumulation and dead spaces is another preventative measure against\nstratification and hence poor digestion and foaming. Also, overloading and\nfluctuation of digesters loading should be avoided by daily and weekly\nmonitoring of solids loading rates and the digesters performance. Although the\ntypical ranges of organic loading rates for AD, as reported in the literature, are\nquite broad, it is believed that there is a critical threshold of organic loading that\ncan vary between digesters depending largely on both feed and digested sludge\ncharacteristics, beyond which foaming can occur. All the above, however, are at\n29\nthis stage suggestions of how foaming can be prevented \/ minimized in\nanaerobic digesters as this paper has shown that there is lack of experimental\nevidence and important gaps in knowledge in order to fully understand how\nfoaming can occur from digester operation, i.e. what the temperature fluctuation\nneeded to induce foaming in AD is, how solids loading and at what\nconcentrations can have an impact on foaming, how the mixing intensity can be\nassessed in anaerobic digesters.\nThe effect of surface active agents on foaming is currently poorly supported by\nexperimental data or is site specific and does not represent a systematic\ninvestigation of the overall AD foaming problem. This however, could be\nattributed to the large number of compounds involved and the complexity of the\ndigestion process in terms of continuous degradation and operational\ntemperatures that can have an impact on the physicochemical characteristics of\ncompounds. It is evident however, that the same species of bacteria, Gordonia\nand Microthrix, have been identified as the foaming causes in both AS and AD.\nThis indicates that there is potentially a relationship between the two processes\nand AD foaming could be a result of AS foaming due to the high numbers of\nfilamentous and mycolic-acid containing bacteria in SAS carried through to the\ndigesters. By reducing therefore, the numbers of filamentous and other mycolic-\nacid containing bacteria in AS plants the risk of AD foaming could be minimized.\nHowever, the above suggestions are not yet supported by experimental\nevidence in the literature and further research is necessary in order to clearly\ndemonstrate a relationship between AS and AD foaming. Taking into account\n30\nthat wastewater foams are 3-phase systems with gas-liquid-solid interactions, it\nbecomes apparent that foaming occurs when the threshold of surface active\nagents in an anaerobic digester is exceeded and the solids (hydrophobic\nbacteria) act as stabilizing agents. The determination of the critical\nconcentrations of surface active agents for foam initiation and the critical\nconcentrations of solids for foam stabilization is crucial and monitoring of such\nparameters could provide a preventative and cost-effective foam control method\nfor the water industry.\n5 Conclusion\nFoaming is a widespread phenomenon in AD. It causes significant operational\nproblems and reduces revenues due to impaired gas recovery. The literature\nassociates foaming incidents with certain design and operational factors and\nseveral plausible causal mechanisms have been proposed. There is, however,\na lack of experimental evidence to support these. This paper adopted the novel\napproach of using existing knowledge of activated sludge foaming to provide a\nconceptual basis for understanding foaming in AD. Wastewater foams are 3-\nphase systems comprising of gas bubbles, liquid and solid particles. This 3-\nphase matrix requires the presence of foam initiating and stabilizing\nsubstances. Whilst the literature confirms the presence of candidate foam\ninitiating and stabilizing substances in AD systems their critical concentrations\nare not yet known..\nREFERENCES\nAparicio, I., Santos, J.L., Alonso, E. 2009.
