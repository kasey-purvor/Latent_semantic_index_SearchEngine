Introduction\nRelativistic electrons (E > 1 MeV) in the Earth\u2019s radiation belts are usually confined25\nto two distinct zones. The inner radiation belt, which lies in the region 1.2 < L < 2.0, is26\nrelatively stable. In contrast, the outer radiation belt, which lies in the region 3.0 < L <27\n7.0, varies dramatically, particularly during enhanced geomagnetic activity [Paulikas and28\nBlake, 1979; Baker et al., 1986, 1994, 1997; Li et al., 1997; Reeves et al., 1998]. This29\nvariability is caused by an imbalance between source, transport and loss processes, all30\nof which become enhanced during geomagnetic storms [Horne, 2002; Summers et al.,31\n2004; 2007a; Thorne et al., 2005; Horne et al., 2006]. Understanding this variability is32\nimportant since enhanced fluxes of relativistic electrons damage spacecraft [Wrenn, 1995;33\nBaker, 2001; Wrenn et al., 2002] and are a risk to humans in space. Indeed, as society34\nbecomes ever more reliant on its assets in space, there is an increasing need to improve our35\nknowledge of the processes governing the behaviour of these so-called \u201ckiller\u201d electrons.36\nThe slot region (2.0 < L < 3.0), that usually separates the inner (1.3 < L < 2.0) and37\nouter (3.0 < L < 7.0) radiation belts, forms as the result of a balance between inward38\nradial diffusion and pich angle scattering loss [Lyons and Thorne, 1973]. However, during39\nmajor geomagnetic storms, such as the Halloween storm in 2003, the flux of relativistic40\nelectrons in the slot region increases dramatically [Baker et al., 2004], as a result of41\nenhanced inward transport and wave acceleration [Horne et al., 2005; Shprits et al., 2006;42\nThorne et al., 2007]. The enhanced flux of relativistic electrons subsequently decay to the43\npre-storm equilibrium levels on a timescale of days to weeks, largely due to the resonant44\npitch angle scattering by plasmaspheric hiss [Lyons et al., 1972; Lyons and Thorne, 1973;45\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 4 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nAlbert 1994; Abel and Thorne 1998a, 1998b], although losses due to lightning-induced46\nelectron precipitation may be important at lower energies [Voss et al., 1998; Blake et47\nal., 2001; Rodger et al., 2002]. Further out pitch angle scattering by plasmaspheric hiss48\ncontributes to the loss of outer radiation belt electrons during the main and recovery49\nphases of a storm [Summers et al., 2007a] and can explain the quiet-time decay of outer50\nradiation belt electrons over a wide range of energies and L shells [e.g., Meredith et al.,51\n2006a].52\nPlasmaspheric hiss is a broadband, structureless, whistler mode emission that is ob-53\nserved in the frequency range from 100 Hz to several kHz. Plasmaspheric hiss is observed54\nin high density regions associated with the plasmasphere [Dunckel and Helliwell, 1969;55\nRussell et al., 1969; Thorne et al., 1973] and plasmaspheric plumes [Chan and Holzer,56\n1976; Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al., 1978; Parrot and Lefeuvre, 1986]. Plasmaspheric hiss57\nintensifies during storms and substorms but can also persist during relatively quiet con-58\nditions [Smith et al., 1974; Thorne et al., 1974; 1977; Meredith et al., 2004]59\nThere are two leading theories for the origin of plasmaspheric hiss, in situ amplifica-60\ntion of wave turbulence in space [e.g., Thorne et al., 1973; 1979; Church and Thorne,61\n1983; Huang et al., 1983; Thorne and Barfield, 1976; Solomon et al., 1988; Cornilleau-62\nWehrlin et al., 1993] and lightning generated whistlers [e.g., Dowden, 1971; Draganov63\net al., 1993; Bortnik et al., 2003]. Although lightning generated whistlers are impulsive,64\nafter several magnetospheric reflections, dispersion, and mixing with other lightning gen-65\nerated whistlers, it is postulated that they merge into a broadband signal that becomes66\nplasmaspheric hiss [Dowden, 1971; Draganov et al., 1993; Bortnik et al., 2003].67\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 5\nGreen et al., [2005] recently analysed data from DE1 and IMAGE and showed that the68\ndistribution of the wave emissions at 3 kHz is similar to the distribution of lightning in69\ngeographic longitude, namely that the emissions are stronger over the continents than70\nthe ocean. They stated that the correspondence between the enhanced intensities and the71\ncontinents occurs over the frequency range 0.5 < f < 3.0 kHz and concluded that lightning72\nis the dominant source of plasmaspheric hiss. This interpretation has been disputed [see73\nthe comment by Thorne et al., 2006 and the reply by Green et al., 2006]. Meredith et74\nal. [2006b] subsequently analysed the longitudinal distribution of the wave intensities75\nover the frequency range 0.1 < f < 5.0 kHz using data from the CRRES satellite. They76\nfound that the waves at higher frequencies (2.0 < f < 5.0 kHz) are most likely related77\nto lightning generated whistlers, consistent with the Green et al., [2005] results at 3 kHz.78\nHowever, in sharp contrast to the higher frequency waves, they found that the waves at79\nlower frequencies (0.1 < f < 2.0 kHz) are independent of lightning activity, are stronger on80\nthe dayside, and increase with geomagnetic activity. This suggests that wave turbulence81\nin space, generated by plasma instabilities, is responsible for the bulk of the wave power82\nbetween 100 Hz and 2 kHz. Furthermore, the wave intensities are an order of magnitude83\nor more higher at the lower frequencies [Meredith et al., 2006b]. Since electron loss, via84\npitch angle scattering into the loss cone, is proportional to the wave power, this suggests85\nthat natural turbulence could be responsible for the formation of the slot region.86\nThe purpose of this paper is to take into account the different generation mechanisms87\nof the plasmaspheric wave emissions and assess their relative roles in the loss of energetic88\nelectrons. In this study we split the plasmaspheric wave emissions into two wave bands, the89\nlow frequency waves (0.1 < f < 2.0 kHz) for which there is strong evidence for generation90\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 6 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nby plasma instabilities in space, and the high frequency waves (2.0 < f < 5.0 kHz) which91\nare most likely generated by lightning in thunderstorms as lightning generated whistlers.92\nAlthough lightning generated whistlers may contribute to the low frequency band, our93\nobservations suggest that the low frequency band is dominated by waves generated by94\nwave turbulence in space [Meredith et al., 2006b]. Similarly, waves generated by wave95\nturbulence in space may occur in the high frequency band, but our observations suggest96\nthat the high frequency band has a significant contribution from lightning generated97\nwhistlers. We henceforth refer to the low frequency band as plasmaspheric hiss, and98\nthe high frequency band as lightning generated whistlers. We model the distribution of99\nthe wave power in these two bands and use the PADIE code to determine their relative100\nimportance for electron loss in the slot region and beyond.101\n2. Instrumentation\nThe wave data used in this study were provided by the Plasma Wave Experiment on102\nboard CRRES. This satellite, which was launched on 25 July 1990, operated in a highly103\nelliptical geosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 305 km, an apogee of 35,768 km104\nand an inclination of 18o. The orbital period was approximately 10 hours, and the initial105\napogee was at a magnetic local time (MLT) of 0800 MLT. The magnetic local time of106\napogee decreased at a rate of approximately 1.3 hours per month until the satellite failed107\non 11 October 1991, when its apogee was at about 1400 MLT. The satellite covered a108\nrange of L shells from L = 1.05 to L = \u223c8 and a range of magnetic latitudes within \u00b130o109\nof the magnetic equator, sweeping through the radiation belts approximately 5 times per110\nday, providing good coverage of this important region for almost 15 months.111\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 7\nThe Plasma Wave Experiment provided measurements of electric fields from 5.6 Hz to112\n400 kHz, using a 100 m tip-to-tip long wire antenna, with a dynamic range covering a113\nfactor of at least 105 in amplitude [Anderson et al.,1992]. The sweep frequency receiver114\ncovered the frequency range from 100 Hz to 400 kHz in four bands with 32 logarithmically115\nspaced steps per band, the fractional step separation, \u2206 f\/f, being about 6.7% across the116\nentire frequency range.117\n3. Data Analysis\n3.1. Determination of the Characteristic Frequencies\nThe local electron gyrofrequency, fce, is determined directly from the fluxgate mag-118\nnetometer onboard the spacecraft [Singer et al., 1992]. The equatorial electron gyrofre-119\nquency, fce,eq, is subsequently determined from the local gyrofrequency assuming a dipole120\nfield:121\nfce,eq = fceL\n3 cos6 \u03bbm\/\n\u221a\n(1 + 3 sin2 \u03bbm) (1)\nwhere \u03bbm is the magnetic latitude.122\nInside the plasmasphere emissions at the upper hybrid resonance frequency, fuhr are123\nusually well-defined and the electron plasma frequency, fpe, is determined from measure-124\nments of fuhr using the relationship f\n2\npe = f\n2\nuhr \u2212 f 2ce. Beyond the plasmapause fpe is125\ndetermined from the lower frequency limit of the electromagnetic continuum radiation126\nwhich is taken to be a plasma wave cut off at the plasma frequency [Gurnett and Shaw,127\n1973].128\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 8 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nInside L = 3 the plasma frequency, and consequently the upper hybrid frequency, can\nexceed 400 kHz which is the upper frequency limit of the sweep frequency receiver. In\nthese circumstances we apply a correction when the observations at L = 3 are inside the\nplasmapause by assuming that the radial density profile in the plasmasphere is represented\nby an L\u22124 distribution [Chappel et al. 1970]. In this case, the plasma frequency, fpe, scales\nas L\u22122. Therefore, when fuhr exceeds 400 kHz at a given L, (L < 3) and the measurement\nat L = L0 = 3.0 is in the plasmasphere, we estimate fpe(L) using the derived plasma\nfrequency at L0, fpe(L0), using:\nfpe(L) = L\n2\n0fpe(L0)\/L\n2 (2)\n3.2. Wave Database\nThe wave data are initially corrected for the instrumental background response and129\nsmoothed by using a running 3 minute average to take out the beating effects due to130\ndifferences in the sampling and the spin rate. Spurious data points, data spikes, and131\nperiods of instrumental downtime are flagged and ignored in the subsequent statistical132\nanalyses. Twelve orbits, during which nontraditional configurations were deployed for133\ntesting purposes, are also excluded from the analyses.134\nSince pitch angle diffusion rates scale as the magnetic field intensity the electric field\nspectral intensities, SE, are converted to magnetic field spectral intensities, SB, using the\nexpression:\nSB =\n1\nc2\n(\n1 +\nf 2pe\nf(fce \u2212 f)\n)\nSE (3)\nderived from Maxwell\u2019s 3 rd equation and the cold plasma dispersion relation for whistler135\nmode waves assuming that the direction of propagation of the waves is parallel to the136\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 9\nambient magnetic field. Here c is the speed of light and f is the wave frequency. The137\nwave magnetic field intensities for plasmaspheric hiss and lightning generated whistlers138\nare subsequently determined by integrating the wave magnetic field spectral intensities139\nover the frequency range 0.1 < f < 2.0 and 2.0 < f < 5.0 kHz respectively.140\nThe wave magnetic field spectral intensity in pT2Hz\u22121 in each frequency channel, to-141\ngether with the wave magnetic field intensities of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning gen-142\nerated whistlers in pT2, the ratio fpe\/fce,eq and the electric field intensities between143\nfce < f < 2fce, are rebinned as a function half-orbit (outbound and inbound) and L144\nin steps of 0.1L. The universal time (UT), magnetic latitude (\u03bbm), magnetic local time145\n(MLT), and time spent in each bin are also recorded at the same resolution. The resulting146\ndatabase, consisting of measurements from 939 orbits (1878 half-orbits), is subsequently147\nanalysed to determine the average wave spectral profiles over the frequency range 0.1148\n< f < 5.0 kHz as a function of L shell and geomagnetic activity.149\n3.3. Identification of Plasmaspheric Hiss and Lightning Generated Whistlers\nThe database of wave emissions in the frequency range between 0.1 and 5.0 kHz may con-150\ntain other wave modes in addition to plasmaspheric hiss and lightning generated whistlers.151\nThese other wave modes are carefully removed from the database as described below.152\nWhistler-mode chorus waves, which are observed in the low-density region outside of the153\nplasmapause, can fall into the frequency range between 0.1 and 5 kHz [e.g. Meredith et al.,154\n2001]. In order to exclude these emissions from the study we adopt a criterion based on the155\namplitude of the waves in the band fce < f < 2fce. Waves in this frequency band, which156\ncontain contributions from both electron cyclotron harmonic waves and thermal noise,157\ntend to be excluded from the high density region inside the plasmapause. Specifically158\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 10 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nwe adopt the criterion, based on a previous experimental study using data from the159\nCRRES Plasma Wave Experiment, that the wave amplitude for frequencies in the range160\nfce < f < 2fce must be less than 0.0005 mVm\n\u22121 in order for wave emissions in the161\nfrequency range 0.1 < f < 5 kHz to be included in the survey [Meredith et al., 2004]. This162\ncriterion naturally restricts the study to the plasmasphere which is the region where the163\nvast majority of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning generated whistlers are observed.164\nMagnetosonic waves, which are observed in the inner magnetosphere at frequencies165\nbelow the lower hybrid resonance frequency, may also fall into the frequency range between166\n0.1 and 5 kHz. Gurnett [1976] analysed equatorial crossings in the region 2 < L < 3.5167\nand found that the waves were largely confined to within 5o of the magnetic equatorial168\nplane. These waves are excluded from our survey by excluding emissions observed within169\n\u00b15o of the magnetic equator.170\n4. Calculation of Electron Loss Timescales\nWe investigate the relative roles of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning generated whistlers171\nas loss processes using wave observations from the CRRES spacecraft to calculate the172\npitch-angle diffusion rates for electrons. The diffusion rates are calculated using the173\nPADIE (Pitch Angle and energy Diffusion of Ions and Electrons) code [Glauert and Horne,174\n2005].175\nSince resonant scattering by hiss is not sensitive to the ion composition an elec-176\ntron\/proton plasma is assumed.

We assume that the electron187\ndistribution function satisfies the one-dimensional pitch-angle diffusion equation and can188\nbe factorised into time-dependent and pitch-angle dependent functions [Lyons et al., 1972;189\nAlbert 1994]. The resulting equation can be cast as a two-point boundary value problem190\nin 4 variables [Albert, 1994], and solved to obtain the loss timescale, \u03c4 [Meredith et al.,191\n2006a].192\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 12 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\n4.1. Model of the Wave Power\nEnergetic electrons (E > 100 keV) in the Earth\u2019s outer radiation belt drift around the193\nEarth on timescales of the order of hours or less which means that they typically complete194\nmany orbits during their lifetime. We thus require a global model of the wave spectral195\nintensities to obtain an estimate of the loss timescales.196\nGlobal statistical models of the average intensities of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning197\ngenerated whistlers are shown as a function of L and MLT for different levels of geomag-198\nnetic activity in Figure 1. From left to right models are presented for quiet (AE\u2217 < 100199\nnT), moderate (100 < AE\u2217 < 500 nT), and active (AE\u2217 > 500 nT) conditions. Here AE\u2217200\nis the maximum value of the AE index in the previous 3 hours [Meredith et al., 2004].201\nThe average intensities are shown in the large panels and the corresponding sampling202\ndistributions are in the small panels. Plasmaspheric hiss (bottom) is present during quiet203\ntimes but intensifies during moderate and active conditions consistent with previous work204\n[Meredith et al., 2004]. The waves peak on the dayside during active conditions with205\nintensities typically of the order of 3000 pT2. Lightning generated whistlers (top) tend206\nto be an order of magnitude or more less intense than plasmaspheric hiss over the entire207\nregion and during all conditions. In the region 2 < L < 3 lightning generated whistlers208\nare strongest in the evening sector. They also increase with increasing geomagnetic activ-209\nity which suggests that the lightning generated waves may be further amplified by wave210\nparticle interactions in space. Further out, in the region 3 < L < 4 a second population of211\nstronger waves are observed during moderate and active conditions on the dayside. These212\nwaves, which are substorm-dependent, are unlikely to be related to lightning generated213\nwhistlers since D region attenuation maximises on the dayside and the lightning activity214\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 13\nis weakest in the morning sector. This suggests that waves generated by wave turbulence215\nin space can extend to higher frequencies and that waves classified as lightning-generated216\nwhistlers may contain a contribution from natural instabilities. However, since the fre-217\nquency range from 2 - 5 kHz includes lightning generated waves [Meredith et al., 2006b],218\nwe can use this band to estimate a lower limit on the loss timescales due to lightning219\ngenerated whistlers.220\nTo assess the frequency distribution of the waves we determine the average wave mag-221\nnetic field spectral intensities inside the plasmasphere as a function of frequency, L shell222\nand geomagnetic activity. We average the wave spectral intensities first over the magnetic223\nlatitude range 5o < |\u03bbm| < 30o and then over magnetic local time. The resulting spectral224\nintensities (black traces) are plotted as a function of frequency in Figure 2. The spectral225\nintensities are shown for quiet (top) and active (bottom) conditions for, from left to right,226\nL = 2.0 to L = 4.0 in steps of 0.5L. The vertical dashed line at 2 kHz divides the frequency227\nrange into plasmaspheric hiss (to the left) and lightning generated whistlers (to the right).228\nIn all cases the wave spectral intensity maximises at low frequencies and subsequently de-229\ncreases with increasing frequency. The bulk of the wave power in the region 2.0 < L <230\n4.0 is clearly associated with plasmaspheric hiss, during both quiet and active conditions.231\nThe PADIE code requires the frequency distribution of the waves to be modelled as a232\nGaussian or series of Gaussian distributions. We find that three Gaussian profiles are233\nneeded to provide a good fit to the entire frequency range. The first component (red) is a234\nleast squares fit to plasmaspheric hiss at low frequencies and has an upper cut-off at the235\nfrequency where the fit departs from the data. The second component (orange) is a least236\nsquares fit to plasmaspheric hiss from the upper cut-off of the first component to 2 kHz237\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 14 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nand the third component (green) is a least squares fit to the lightning generated whistlers.238\nSince the second and third components do not possess a peak in their spectral intensities239\nwe fix the peak frequency at 0.1 Hz. The fits can be seen to represent the data well over240\nalmost the entire frequency range for all activities and L shells. Details of the fitting241\nparameters are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for quiet and active conditions respectively. Here242\nf0,x, dfx, and B\n2\nw,x represent the peak frequency in Hz, the frequency bandwidth in Hz,243\nand the wave intensity in pT2 of the xth Gaussian component.244\nSince plasmaspheric hiss is observed throughout the plasmasphere [e.g. Thorne et al.,245\n1973], we assume the average wave spectral profiles from 5o < |\u03bbm| < 30o are represen-246\ntative of the emissions at all latitudes. We then calculate the bounce-average diffusion247\nrate which takes into account the scattering of particles in pitch angle over the complete248\nrange of latitudes between the particle\u2019s mirror points. In general the waves resonate with249\nhigher energy electrons at higher latitudes and will tend to scatter higher energy electrons250\ninto the loss cone at higher latitudes. This is shown in more detail in Figure 2 of Horne251\nand Thorne [2003] for the case of chorus waves.252\n4.2. Wave Normal Models\nPlasmaspheric hiss appears to propagate over a broad range of wave normal angles253\nwith predominantly field-aligned propagation near the geomagnetic equator and more254\noblique propagation at higher latitudes. [Parrot and Lefeuvre, 1986; Hayakawa et al.,255\n1986; Santolik et al., 2001]. For example, in the equatorial region (\u03bbm < 10\no) Parrot256\nand Lefeuvre, [1986] found two populations of wave normal angles one lying in the range257\n0o \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 30o, the other in the range 40o \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 60o. At higher latitudes (\u03bbm > 20o) most258\nof the waves had larger wave normal angles in the range 55o \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 85o. To investigate259\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 15\nthe effect of the wave normal angle on the precipitation lifetimes we use three different260\nangular distributions of hiss, chosen to be representative of these observations [Table 3].261\nLightning generated whistlers guided along the magnetic field by ducts of enhanced262\nplasma density for f < 0.5fce (and density depletions for f > 0.5fce) propagate at small263\nwave normal angles [Smith, 1961]. Unducted lightning generated whistlers that exit the264\nionosphere at low latitudes may propagate to the slot region and beyond following many265\nmagnetospheric reflections. The wave normal angle of magnetospherically reflected (MR)266\nwhistlers rapidly increase towards \u03c8= 90o at the first reflection. The waves subsequently267\nremain highly oblique [e.g., Thorne and Horne, 1994]. We, therefore, adopt the small and268\nlarge wave normal models to investigate the role of ducted and MR whistlers respectively269\n[Table 3].270\nThe conversion from electric field intensity to magnetic field intensity assumes parallel271\npropagation [Meredith et al., 2004]. We calculate approximate intensities for propagation272\nat 52o and 80o using the cold plasma dispersion solver in the HOTRAY code [Horne, 1989]273\nassuming a frequency of 0.4 kHz and 0.7 kHz for the two components of plasmaspheric274\nhiss and a frequency of 2.0 kHz for lightning generated whistlers. These frequencies275\nare chosen since, for each component, they roughly correspond to the frequencies where276\nthe wave power peaks. The wave intensities for plasmaspheric hiss for the three wave277\nnormal models, and the ducted and MR whistlers are plotted as a function of L shell278\nin Figure 3. The results are presented for both quiet (left) and active (right) conditions.279\nPlasmaspheric hiss (red) is typically one or two orders of magnitude more intense than the280\nlightning generated whistlers (blue) during both quiet and active conditions. The wave281\nintensity for plasmaspheric hiss propagating parallel to the magnetic field (red, solid) is282\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 16 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\ntypically factors of 1.5 and 6 higher than for plasmaspheric hiss propagating at 52o (red,283\ndashed) and 80o (red, dotted) respectively. Ducted whistlers (blue, solid) are about a284\nfactor of 4 more intense than MR whistlers in the region 2.0 < L < 3.5. For each wave285\nnormal angle considered plasmaspheric hiss is typically a factor of 3 more intense during286\nactive conditions. At low L (2.0 < L < 2.5) lightning generated whistlers are up to a287\nfactor of 2 more intense during active conditions. Further out the wave intensities increase288\nby a factor of 10 or more and are due to the appearance of the second population of waves289\nin this frequency range noted above.290\n4.3. Model of fpe\/fce,eq\nThe mean value of the ratio of fpe\/fce,eq is plotted as a function of L shell and MLT291\nfor different levels of geomagnetic activity in the top panels of Figure 4. From left to292\nright the results are shown for quiet, moderate, and active conditions. The ratios are293\nshown in the large panels and the sampling distributions in the small panels. fpe\/fce,eq294\nranges from \u223c5 at the inner edge of the slot region to \u223c15 near geostationary orbit.295\nDuring active conditions the plasmasphere is compressed, particularly on the dawnside296\nas evidenced by the sampling distribution of the measurements inside the plasmasphere.297\nFor measurements inside the plasmasphere the average values of fpe\/fce,eq at any given298\nlocation tend to be slightly less than during quiet conditions. Line plots of the ratio299\nfpe\/fce,eq are plotted as a function of MLT for specified L shells for quiet, moderate, and300\nactive conditions in the bottom panels of Figure 3. The solid lines, colour-coded to denote301\nthe L shell, represent the data and the dashed lines indicate the average values. At each302\nL shell the values typically lie within \u00b120% of the mean value and justify the use of the303\nmean value in our calculations. The post-noon minimum seen in the region 3.0 < L < 4.0304\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 17\nduring moderate and active conditions is intriguing. This feature is caused by a sampling305\neffect and is due to the occurrence of strong and persistent magnetic activity when the306\nsatellite was in this region, as evidenced by the concomitant poor sampling statistics for307\nquiet conditions. The average values of fpe\/fce,eq are plotted as a function of L shell in308\nFigure 5. The average value of fpe\/fce,eq increases approximately linearly with increasing309\nL shell, in line with expectations since the equatorial magnetic field strength scales as310\nL\u22123, and the number density scales as L\u22124. The average values of fpe\/fce,eq during quiet311\nconditions (blue) are typically \u223c10% larger than during active conditions (red).312\n5. Electron Loss Timescales\nThe electron loss timescales due to plasmaspheric hiss (red) and lightning generated313\nwhistlers (blue) at L = 2.5 are shown as a function of energy (100 keV < E < 5 MeV)314\nfor active conditions in Figure 6. The results for the small, intermediate, and large315\nwave normal models are shown as solid, dashed and dotted lines respectively. The upper316\nand lower black horizontal dotted lines represent loss timescales of 10 days and 1 day317\nrespectively. For energies greater than 500 keV the smallest loss timescales are due to318\nplasmaspheric hiss propagating at small or intermediate wave normal angles and can be319\nas low as \u223c1 day at 2 MeV. The loss timescales for plasmaspheric hiss propagating at320\nlarge wave normal angles are all greater than 500 days, indicating that these waves are321\nrelatively unimportant. At relativistic energies (E > 1 MeV) the loss timescales due322\nto plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles are an323\norder of magnitude or more shorter than those due to ducted whistlers. However, at lower324\nenergies (E < 500 keV) ducted whistlers become a more effective scattering agent than325\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 18 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nplasmaspheric hiss but the loss timescales are long and greater than 100 days. The loss326\ntimescales for MR whistlers are insignificant at all energies.327\nWe investigate the behaviour of the electron loss timescales as a function of energy at328\ndifferent L shells during active conditions in the bottom panels of Figure 7. From left to329\nright the electron loss timescales are shown as a function of energy for L = 2.0 to L = 4.0330\nin steps of 0.5L. At any given L shell the shortest loss timescales occur predominantly for331\nplasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles. Moving332\nout in L plasmaspheric hiss becomes increasingly effective over a wider range of energies.333\nAt L = 2.0 the loss timescales due to plasmaspheric hiss can be as low as 10 days at 5 MeV334\nduring active conditions but become prohibitively large at energies less than 2 MeV. At L335\n= 3.0 the loss timescales are 1 - 10 days for waves propagating at small and intermediate336\nwave normal angles over a wide range of energies (300 keV < E < 3 MeV). Further out,337\nthe loss timescales due to plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small or intermediate wave338\nnormal angles can be significantly shorter than 1 day over a wide range of energies.339\nThe loss timescales during quiet conditions are shown in the top panels of Figure 7.340\nOnce again, at any given L shell the shortest loss timescales occur predominantly for341\nplasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles. Further-342\nmore, moving out in L plasmaspheric hiss becomes increasingly effective over a wider343\nrange of energies. However, the loss timescales tend to be about an order of magnitude344\nsmaller during active conditions when compared to quiet conditions.345\nWe investigate the behaviour of the electron loss timescales as a function of L shell346\nat different energies during quiet and active conditions in the top and bottom panels347\nof Figure 8 respectively. From left to right the electron loss timescales are shown as a348\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 19\nfunction of L shell for energies ranging from 100 keV to 2 MeV. The loss timescales for349\nelectrons with energies of 100 keV fall below 10 days only in the inner region of the outer350\nradiation belt (3.5 < L < 4.0). However, as the electron energy increases plasmaspheric351\nhiss becomes more effective at lower L shells. For example, at 500 keV the loss timescales352\ncan be less than 10 days from L = 3.0 and beyond. At MeV energies plasmaspheric hiss353\nis an effective scattering agent in both the slot region and beyond (2.5 < L < 4.0).354\n6. Discussion\nThe slot region (2.0 < L < 3.0) between the inner and outer radiation belt is usually355\ndevoid of relativistic electrons. However, during strong storms, the slot region can become356\nfilled [e.g., Baker et al., 2004]. The slot region subsequently reforms on a timescale of days357\nto weeks. For example, Baker et al. [2004], using SAMPEX data, estimated e-folding loss358\ntimescales of 4.6 and 2.9 days following enhancements of 2 - 6 MeV electrons at L = 2.5 in359\nNovember 2003. At L = 2.5, the loss timescales of 2 MeV electrons due to plasmaspheric360\nhiss range from 1-10 days depending on the level of geomagnetic activity (Figure 7) and361\nare consistent with the SAMPEX findings.362\nAt 1 MeV losses due to plasmaspheric hiss at L = 2.5 take place on slightly longer363\ntimescales of tens of days (Figure 7). These losses are solely due to plasmaspheric hiss364\npropagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles. Plasmaspheric hiss prop-365\nagating at large wave normal angles and lightning generated whistlers do not play a366\nsignificant role. Since plasmaspheric hiss is caused by wave turbulence in space [Meredith367\net al., 2006b], wave turbulence in space is responsible for the formation of the slot region.368\nAt lower energies (E <\u223c 500 keV) at L = 2.5 both plasmaspheric hiss and lightning369\ngenerated whistlers are ineffective (Figure 7). In this region and at these energies whistler370\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 20 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\nmode waves from ground-based VLF transmitters, used for communication with sub-371\nmarines are likely to be the dominant loss mechanism [e.g., Abel and Thorne, 1998a].372\nDuring quiet times the loss timescales in the region 3.0 < L < 4.0 lie in the range 3-10373\ndays at 1 MeV (Figure 8), consistent with observations and previous estimates using the374\nPADIE code with CRRES measurements of plasmaspheric hiss [Meredith et al., 2006a].375\nAt lower energies, 200 keV, the loss timescales can be faster than a day at L = 4.0 but376\nrise to 5 days at L = 3.5 and become prohibitively large inside L = 3.0 (Figure 8).377\nIf plasmaspheric hiss is to play an important role during active times then the timescale378\nfor loss must also be of the order of a few days or less. We see that this can occur in the379\ninner part of the outer radiation belt (3.5 < L < 4.0) over the important energy range380\nfrom \u223c 200 keV to \u223c 1 MeV (Figure 7). Plasmaspheric hiss could thus play an important381\nrole in the loss of energetic electrons in the region 3.5 < L < 4.0 during magnetically382\ndisturbed periods. During active periods the plasmasphere tends to be restricted to the383\nregion inside L = 4.0, although hiss may also be present in plumes at higher L during384\nthese intervals. Indeed, recent modelling results suggest that plasmaspheric hiss can also385\neffectively scatter energetic electrons in plumes [Summers et al., 2007b].386\nUnducted lightning generated whistlers can form a population of magnetospherically387\nreflected (MR) whistlers that remain geomagnetically trapped in the inner magnetosphere.388\nIt has been suggested that these waves could merge into a continuum with characteristic389\nfeatures similar to plasmaspheric hiss [Dowden, 1971; Draganov et al., 1993; Bortnik et390\nal., 2003]. CRRES observations suggest that these waves make a significant contribution391\nto the plasmaspheric emissions at high frequencies (2.0 < f < 5.0 kHz) but do not392\ncontribute significantly to the higher intensity emissions at lower frequencies (0.1 < f <393\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES X - 21\n2.0 kHz) [Meredith et al., 2006b]. Since MR whistlers propagate at large wave normal394\nangles [Thorne and Horne, 1994], our present study confirms that they cannot play an395\nimportant role in radiation belt electron loss.396\n7. Conclusions\nWe estimate loss timescales due to plasmaspheric hiss and lightning generated whistlers397\nin the slot region and beyond using the PADIE code with CRRES wave data. Our398\nprincipal results are as follows:399\n1. Plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles is the400\ndominant scattering agent of electrons with energies greater than 500 keV in the region401\n2.5 < L < 4.0. Plasmaspheric hiss propagating at large wave normal angles and lightning402\ngenerated whistlers do not contribute significantly to radiation belt loss.403\n2. The loss timescale of 2 MeV electrons due to plasmaspheric hiss in the centre of404\nthe slot region (L = 2.5) lies in the range 1-10 days, consistent with recent SAMPEX405\nobservations406\n3. The slot region at \u223cMeV energies is caused by resonant wave particle interactions407\nwith plasmaspheric hiss. Since plasmaspheric hiss is produced by wave turbulence in space,408\nthe slot region is caused by wave turbulence in space and not lightning (as suggested by409\nGreen et al., [2005]).410\n4. During active conditions losses due to plasmaspheric hiss may occur on a timescale411\nof 1 day or less for 200 keV < E < 1 MeV in the region 3.5 < L < 4.0.412\nPlasmaspheric hiss, generated by wave turbulence in space, is an important loss mech-413\nanism both in the slot region and beyond. Indeed, plasmaspheric hiss may even be an414\nimportant loss process in the inner region of the outer radiation belt during magnetically415\nD R A F T May 2, 2007, 11:20am D R A F T\nX - 22 MEREDITH ET AL.: SLOT REGION ELECTRON LOSS TIMESCALES\ndisturbed periods. Realistic, physics-based, models of the Earth\u2019s radiation belts, that416\nare currently being developed to understand and ultimately predict the Earth\u2019s radiation417\nenvironment, should thus include resonant wave-particle interactions with plasmaspheric418\nhiss.419\nAcknowledgments.
