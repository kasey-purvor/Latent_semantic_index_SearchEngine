Ionosphere (plasma convection) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (magnetopause, cusp, and boundary layers;\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nPlasma entry from the solar wind into the magnetosphere oc-\ncurs mainly through the dayside magnetopause. Three main\nregions just inside the magnetopause with different plasma\ncharacteristics, have been recognized since the initial survey\nby Heos-2 (Haerendel et al., 1978): the low-latitude bound-\nary layer (LLBL), the high-altitude cusp and the plasma man-\ntle. Across these boundary regions, a competition exists be-\ntween diffusion and reconnection for mass, momentum and\nenergy transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere.\nThe low-latitude magnetopause adjacent to the LLBL is the\nmain site for reconnection (Eastman et al., 1976; Newell\nand Meng, 1988; Fuselier et al., 1999), when the interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF) is southward. The LLBL is pop-\nulated by a mixture of plasmas of magnetosheath and mag-\nnetospheric origin and is partly located on closed field lines.\nThe LLBL is magnetically connected to the ionospheric cleft\n(Newell and Meng, 1988), where particle fluxes are lower\nin intensity and extend to higher energies than in the cusp\nlocated just poleward (Aparicio et al., 1991). The high-\naltitude cusp (Paschmann et al., 1976) is located on open field\nlines, where magnetosheath plasma entry is more direct, as\nindicated by the spectral characteristics of the particles which\nare close to those observed in the magnetosheath (Newell and\n142 A. Marchaudon et al.: Transient plasma injections in the dayside magnetosphere\nMeng, 1988). The high-altitude cusp is magnetically con-\nnected to the \u201ccusp proper\u201d at lower altitudes, where plasma\nwith magnetosheath characteristics is also observed. The\npersistency of the cusp proper has led many authors (e.g.\nNewell et al., 1989) to conclude that processes other than\npatchy or transient merging occur in the high-altitude cusp\nsuch as steady-state merging or diffusion. Poleward of the\nhigh-altitude cusp, is the plasma mantle (Rosenbauer et al.,\n1975; Crooker et al., 1977). This boundary layer consists\nof magnetosheath-like plasma with a tailward-directed bulk\nflow parallel to the local magnetic field. Particles entering the\ncusp may move on mantle field lines through convection and\nare dispersed by the velocity filter effect (Reiff et al., 1977).\nFor strongly northward IMF, the high-latitude magnetopause\nadjacent to the mantle is the preferred site of reconnection\n(Maezawa, 1976).\nReconnected magnetic flux tubes allow energy and mo-\nmentum transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere.\nInitially considered as a steady-state process, its intermittent\nand spatially limited nature was discovered, independently\nby Haerendel (1978) and by Russell and Elphic (1978, 1979).\nRussell and Elphic (1978) named these bursts of magnetic re-\nconnection, the Flux Transfer Events (FTEs) and first recog-\nnised their main observational characteristic, the bipolar sig-\nnature in the magnetic field component normal to the magne-\ntopause. Later studies allowed one to refine the description\nof FTEs, namely the plasma signature inside the reconnected\nflux tube, consisting of a mixture of magnetosheath and mag-\nnetospheric plasma (e.g. Farrugia et al., 1988), the acceler-\nated ion flows (e.g. Paschmann et al., 1982) and their larger\noccurrence rate during periods of southward interplanetary\nmagnetic field (e.g. Berchem and Russell, 1984; Lockwood\nand Smith, 1992).\nFlux transfer events map into the ionosphere along mag-\nnetic field lines. The first observation of the ionospheric sig-\nnature of an FTE was made by Goertz et al. (1985) with the\nSTARE VHF coherent radar. Sporadic and spatially limited\nflow bursts moving in the northwest direction were attributed\nto magnetic merging, as indicated by the simultaneous obser-\nvation of a satellite signature at the magnetopause. Several\nstudies with the PACE HF radar followed, and Pinnock et\nal. (1991, 1993, 1995) presented cases of enhanced convec-\ntion channels superimposed on the continuous cusp echoes.\nInside flow channels, the velocity was larger than in the am-\nbient plasma and directed mainly northward, as expected by\nthe Southwood (1987) model for FTEs. Most of these con-\nvection channels are also characterized by an azimuthal ve-\nlocity component, the sign of which depends upon the sign\nof the IMF By component. It was observed that in the North-\nern Hemisphere, the flow is westward for positive By and\neastward for negative By and reversed in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere, in agreement with the convection models (Reiff and\nBurch, 1985; Crooker, 1979, 1988; Cowley et al., 1991),\nwhich assume that the convection is driven by the magnetic\ntension at the reconnection site. It was also observed that\nthe longitudinal extent of these flow bursts is generally larger\nthan their latitudinal extent and that their average repetition\nrate is about 7 min. Parallel currents flowing on the flanks of\nthe flow burst have been modelled (Southwood, 1987; Lock-\nwood et al., 1990, 2001a) and observed (Milan et al., 2000).\nAll the above observations and models suggested that inter-\nmittent and patchy magnetic reconnection was the source of\nFTEs, including sporadic flow bursts which represent their\nionospheric signature. Observations by SuperDARN radars\nhave complemented this set of observations. For example,\nProvan et al. (1998), with a high resolution scan mode, and\nMilan et al. (2000) and Thorolfsson et al. (2000), with the as-\nsociation of radars and optical observations, determined the\nsize, shape, velocity and recurrence rate of the ionospheric\nsignatures of FTEs. These case studies have been confirmed\nby statistical studies of the location, occurrence and relation\nwith the IMF By of the flow bursts (Provan and Yeoman,\n1999; Provan et al., 1999; McWilliams et al., 2000).\nThus, flux transfer events (FTEs) have been extensively\nstudied during the last twenty years, both in the magne-\ntosphere by satellites and in the ionosphere by radars or\nimagers. However, simultaneous observations in the high-\naltitude magnetosphere and in the ionosphere are less nu-\nmerous. Elphic et al. (1990) showed a clear association be-\ntween an FTE, identified near the magnetopause by its mag-\nnetic bipolar signature observed by the ISEE2 satellite, and\npoleward-moving ionospheric flow bursts and auroral forms\nobserved by the EISCAT radar and photometers. Almost\nten years later, Neudegg et al. (1999) have associated the\nsignatures of an FTE observed at the magnetopause by the\nEquator-S satellite and in the ionosphere by a SuperDARN\nradar. In a statistical study, Neudegg et al. (2000) showed a\nclear one-to-one association between reconnected flux tubes\nat the magnetopause and ionospheric poleward moving flow\nbursts.\nThe four-spacecraft Cluster mission, with an optimised\ninter-satellite separation, is well-suited to analyze the de-\ntailed structure of FTEs in the magnetosphere (Bosqued et\nal., 2001; Owen et al., 2001). Coordinated studies be-\ntween Cluster and magnetically conjugate ground-based in-\nstruments are of primary importance to characterize the elec-\ntrodynamic coupling between the ionosphere and the dis-\ntant magnetosphere (Opgenoorth et al., 2001; Lockwood\net al., 2001b). Clear FTE signatures have been recently\nobserved simultaneously by ground-based instruments and\nCluster (Lockwood et al., 2001c; Wild et al., 2001), illustrat-\ning the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling caused by the\nmagnetopause reconnection.\nOn 17 March 2001, between 05:05 and 06:50 UT, Clus-\nter crosses the high-altitude northern cusp while the Super-\nDARN CUTLASS radars measure line-of-sight (l-o-s) veloc-\nities typical of cusp echoes in the conjugate ionosphere. The\ninterplanetary conditions are very quiet, with a mainly north-\nward and duskward IMF and a low solar wind pressure. The\nstudy presented in this paper is limited to a short interval\nbetween 05:15 and 06:00 UT, characterised by a southward\nand dawnward excursion of the IMF, leading to an increased\nrate of magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause. Dur-\ning that time period, characteristic FTE signatures are ob-\nA. Marchaudon et al.: Transient plasma injections in the dayside magnetosphere 143\nserved by Cluster in the magnetosphere, and duskward flow\nbursts are simultaneously observed by the CUTLASS radars\nin the ionosphere, at the magnetic footprint of Cluster. Clus-\nter and radar observations are well correlated. A detailed\ncomparison for three successive injections shows that the lo-\ncal plasma convection velocity and the drift velocity of the\nflux tubes, evaluated in the ionosphere and at 7\u20138RE alti-\ntude (and then mapped into ionosphere) are fully consistent.\n2 Instrumentation\n2.1 Cluster\nThe Cluster mission is composed of four identical spacecraft\nin a tetrahedral formation in order to discriminate between\nsmall-scale spatial and temporal structures. Cluster is lo-\ncated on an elliptical orbit with a perigee of 4RE , an apogee\nof 19.6RE and a period of \u223c58 h. In this paper, we use\ndata from several experiments: the Cluster Ion Spectrometer\n(CIS), the Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM), the Plasma Elec-\ntron and Current Experiment (PEACE), the Waves of High\nfrequency and Sounder for Probing of Electron density by\nRelaxation instrument (WHISPER), the Electric Field and\nWave experiment (EFW) and the Electron Drift Instrument\n(EDI).\nThe Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) experiment (Re`me et\nal., 2001) provides a full, three-dimensional energy\/velocity\ndistribution of the major magnetospheric ions from ther-\nmal energies up to about 40 keV\/e and the moments with a\ntime resolution up to 4 s. The experiment is composed of\ntwo different instruments: the COmposition and DIstribu-\ntion Function analyser (CIS1\/CODIF), which gives the mass\nper charge composition with a medium angular resolution\n(22.5\u25e6), and the Hot Ion Analyser (CIS2\/HIA), which offers\na better energy and angular resolution without mass resolu-\ntion. In this study, we use energy spectrograms and the mo-\nment data (ion velocity components and density) provided by\nthe CIS1\/CODIF and CIS2\/HIA instruments on Cluster 1.\nIn support of CIS observations, data from four other instru-\nments have been used in this paper. The PEACE instrument\n(Johnstone et al., 1997) is designed to measure the electron\nvelocity distribution. The WHISPER instrument (De\u00b4cre\u00b4au et\nal., 2001) yields the electron density determined via the pas-\nsive mode of the relaxation sounder. The EFW instrument\n(Gustafsson et al., 2001) measures the electric field and the\nspacecraft potential, of which the variations are, to a large\nextent, proportional to those of the plasma density. The EDI\ninstrument (Paschmann et al., 2001) measures the drift ve-\nlocity of artificially injected electron beams, from which the\nperpendicular electric field can be deduced.\nThe magnetic field data are provided by the Fluxgate Mag-\nnetometer (FGM) experiment (Balogh et al., 2001). Each\nFGM instrument is composed of two tri-axial fluxgate mag-\nnetic field sensors. In this study, the magnetic field data are\nused with a resolution of \u223c0.125 s. By identifying similar\nbut time-lagged signatures of boundaries on each of the four\nspacecraft, the FGM data are used to derive the velocity of\nthese boundaries.\n2.2 SuperDARN\nThe ionospheric convection is measured by the CUTLASS\nSuperDARN coherent HF radars at Hankasalmi (Finland)\nand Pikkvib\u00e6r (Iceland) (Greenwald et al., 1995). Each radar\nmeasures the l-o-s plasma velocity in the F-region of the\nionosphere. As the CUTLASS radars share a common field-\nof-view, convection velocity vectors can be obtained from\nthe simultaneous measurement of two independent compo-\nnents. The SuperDARN radar beam is narrow, typically 3.3\u25e6\nin azimuthal width, and scans successively 16 adjacent di-\nrections divided into 75 range bins of 45 km length. The\nfield-of-view of each radar is large: over 3000 km in range\nand 53\u25e6 in azimuth. During the period under study, the two\nradars were operated in the high-resolution common mode,\nwith each beam sounded for 3 s, resulting in a full scan every\n1 min.\n3 Geometry of observations and interplanetary condi-\ntions\nOn 17 March 2001, the magnetic footprint of the Clus-\nter spacecraft crosses the field-of-view of the CUTLASS\nradars between 04:50 and 09:20 UT. During the shorter in-\nterval 05:05\u201306:50 UT, the Cluster spacecraft (with an av-\nerage separation of \u223c600 km) encounters the northern ex-\nternal cusp. Cluster is moving sunward from the northern\nlobe through the cusp towards the dayside magnetopause\nclose to the noon magnetic plane, as shown in Fig. 1, which\nrepresents a sketch of the projection of Cluster in the XZ\nGSM plane. The overall cusp crossing has been analysed by\nVontrat-Reberac et al. (2003). In the present paper, we fo-\ncus on a short period between 05:15 and 06:00 UT, during\nwhich Cluster and SuperDARN observe in the cusp the re-\nsponse to a southward and dawnward excursion of the IMF.\nDuring this period, the radars are located in the pre-noon\nsector and observe cusp echoes in the ionosphere at very\nfar horizontal ranges between 2700 and 3300 km. Figure 2\nshows a map of the field-of-view of the CUTLASS radars at\n05:30 UT, in Altitude-Adjusted Corrected GeoMagnetic co-\nordinates (AACGM) (Baker and Wing, 1989). The mapped\nionospheric footprint of Cluster (black dot) is calculated by\nprojection along magnetic field lines, with the Tsyganenko\nT96 model (Tsyganenko, 1995) and real inputs of IMF and\nsolar wind pressure from the ACE satellite. During the period\nof interest, the Cluster footprint remains almost fixed and is\nlocated near 79\u25e6 Magnetic Latitude (MLAT) and 165\u25e6 Mag-\nnetic Longitude (MLON), corresponding to \u223c11:30 Mag-\nnetic Local Time (MLT), where cusp echoes are observed\nby the Hankasalmi radar.\nThe IMF and solar wind data are provided by the ACE\nsatellite located near the Lagrangian L1 libration point, at\nabout 226RE upstream of the Earth. The IMF data are plot-\n144 A.

The Cluster spacecraft configuration is shown around\n06:45 UT, each spacecraft corresponding to a coloured dot with the\nCluster colour-code (SC1-black, SC2-red, SC3-green, SC4-blue).\nThe separation of the spacecraft has been expanded by a factor of\nten to better indicate the tetrahedral configuration in the cusp. Sev-\neral magnetospheric field lines (blue solid lines) have also been plot-\nted.\nted in GSM coordinates with an 86-min delay in Fig. 3.\nThe propagation delay to the dayside ionosphere is evalu-\nated between 86 and 91 min, taking into account a 78-min\ndelay between the ACE and the bowshock (with a solar wind\nbulk speed of \u223c290 km s\u22121), a 5- to 10-min delay across the\nmagnetosheath (Spreiter and Stahara, 1980) and a 3-min de-\nlay between the magnetopause and the dayside ionosphere\n(Etemadi et al., 1988). During the interval 05:05\u201306:50 UT\nwhen Cluster is in the cusp, the solar wind pressure is low,\nless than 0.5 nPa (not shown), and the IMF is characterised\nby mainly positive By and Bz, both with a mean value of\n+3 nT (Fig. 3b and c). The Bx component also remains\nslightly positive, oscillating between 0 and +3 nT (Fig. 3a).\nBut during the interval under study (05:15\u201306:00 UT), a ro-\ntation of the IMF is observed. Initially duskward and north-\nward, the IMF progressively turns dawnward and then south-\nward to reach Bz \u223c\u22122 nT and By \u223c\u22125 nT between 05:30\nand 05:45 UT, after which the IMF returns to its initial di-\nrection. As Bz remains smaller than By , the convection pat-\ntern is mainly controlled by the By component. The rota-\ntion of the IMF is evidenced by the clock angle (Fig. 3d)\nwhich reaches a maximum of 110\u25e6 at \u223c05:40 UT.

The IMF clock angle rotation\nis also favourable to reconnection between the IMF and\nmagnetospheric field lines at the dawnside northern magne-\ntopause. Thus, except for the short period between \u223c05:30\nand \u223c05:45 UT, when IMF Bz < 0, the IMF and solar wind\ndata confirm that very quiet conditions are prevailing and\nsupport the observation of a polar cusp at very high latitudes,\nas it will be shown from Cluster and radar data in the next\nsection.\n4 Observations\n4.1 High-altitude cusp\nIn this section, the presentation will be organised around the\nCIS and FGM data, with reference to the other instruments\nwhen useful. Figure 4 presents data from CIS and FGM on\nboard Cluster 1, for the interval 05:15\u201306:00 UT. The panels\nfrom top to bottom display the magnetic field amplitude, the\ntotal ion density, the ion parallel velocity, the ion perpendic-\nular velocity projected in the XY GSE plane and the energy-\ntime spectrogram of precipitating H+ ions in the 0 \u2212 \u221220\u25e6\npitch angle range. Figure 5 presents data from other instru-\nments of the Cluster 1 and 3, from top to bottom, the WHIS-\nPER (SC1) electron density, the x and y GSE components of\nthe electric field from EFW (SC1) and EDI (SC3), and the\nA.

During the shorter period displayed\nin Fig. 4, the ion density (Fig. 4b) fluctuates between 5 and\n15 cm\u22123 and the mean ion parallel energy (Fig. 4e) is 300 eV,\nboth values being typical of the high-altitude cusp. The\nPEACE data also exhibit typical cusp properties, such as an\nelectron mean energy of 40 eV (Fig. 5d) and essentially bi-\ndirectional electron fluxes (parallel and anti-parallel). The\nWHISPER electron density is of the same order and well\ncorrelated with the CIS ion density (Figs. 4b and 5a). Sev-\neral characteristics of a northward IMF cusp are also ob-\nserved, namely its location at very high latitude, between 79\u25e6\nand 81\u25e6 MLAT (Newell et al., 1989; Palmroth et al., 2001)\nand the energy-time dispersion of the ion injections (Vontrat-\nReberac et al., 2003).\nThe interval 05:25\u201305:54 UT can be divided into three\nsub-intervals, numbered 1, 2 and 3 in Figs. 4 and 5, according\nto the sign of the dawn-dusk component of the perpendicu-\nlar ion velocity in Fig. 4d, which closely follows the IMF By\nvariations. Before interval 1, plasma injections are observed\nat Cluster, with large parallel velocities. This period is asso-\nciated with positive IMF By and Bz before the IMF turning.\nBecause Cluster and SuperDARN observations are not con-\njugate, we will focus only on later injections observed during\ninterval 2.\nBetween 05:25 and 05:36 UT (interval 1 in Figs. 4 and 5),\nthe perpendicular convection velocity is less than 20 km s\u22121\nand points primarily dawnward. The CIS density is low\n(\u223c6\u20137 cm\u22123) with only small fluctuations. The magnetic\nfield amplitude is fairly steady, typical of a quiet period.\nThese observations correspond to a transition phase in the\ncusp, associated with the period when the IMF is rotat-\ning from a northward-duskward orientation to a southward-\ndawnward orientation.\nBetween 05:36 and 05:46 UT (interval 2 in Figs. 4 and 5),\nthe convection at Cluster turns duskward (in the +YGSE di-\nrection). The convection velocity increases up to 50 km s\u22121,\nwith numerous fluctuations in direction and amplitude. The\nparallel ion flux and the ion density exhibit a series of en-\nhancements with multiple peaks. More precisely, when the\n146 A.

Notice that a first peak of parallel velocity also occurs at\n05:36 UT, associated with dawnward perpendicular velocity\nand located at the boundary between intervals 1 and 2. Mag-\nnetic field perturbations are also observed, in particular, the\nmagnetic field amplitude decreases during each velocity en-\nhancement and ion injection (diamagnetic effect). These ob-\nservations coincide with the period of dawnward and south-\nward IMF, favouring the solar wind plasma entry at the dawn-\nside magnetopause. Therefore, one can anticipate that these\nobservations are signatures of cusp plasma injections due to\nmagnetic reconnection.\nBetween 05:46 and 05:54 UT (interval 3 in Fig. 4), the per-\npendicular convection velocity turns dawnward again, with\ncharacteristics similar to interval 1, but the speed remains\nlarge (around 30 km s\u22121). The density presents a large-\nscale enhancement, the ion energies decrease slightly and\nthe energy-time (latitude) dispersion profile is more contin-\nuous, suggesting a change in the reconnection process. In\naddition to the general decrease due to the motion of Clus-\nter towards the magnetopause, the magnetic field amplitude\nshows a reduction followed by an enhancement, which is in-\nverse to the density variation, implying a diamagnetic effect.\nThis interval is associated with the return to the conditions of\nduskward and northward IMF. After 05:54 UT, the increase\nin ion energies suggests the occurrence of a new injection,\nand the perpendicular velocity turns duskward again for sev-\neral minutes, but no apparent change in the IMF can be as-\nsociated with it. All the above observations of the density\nand perpendicular ion velocity during intervals 1-2-3 are con-\nfirmed by the PEACE, WHISPER, EFW and EDI data: the\nion and electron density profiles measured by CIS, PEACE\nand WHISPER (Figs. 4b and 5a) are very similar, resulting\nfrom the need to maintain quasi-neutrality in the cusp (Reiff\net al., 1977; Burch, 1985). Also, the electric field measured\nby EFW and EDI (Fig. 5b and c) confirms the convection\nvelocity obtained by the CIS instrument. The electric field\nprofiles of both experiments are comparable, in spite of the\nA.

In each pair, the upper plot shows the l-o-s\nvelocity and the lower plot shows the amplitude (dB) of the\nbackscattered signal. Three beams are presented: from top\nto bottom, beams 13 and 14 of Hankasalmi and beam 2 of\nPikkvib\u00e6r. These three beams are directed mainly eastward\nand thus, measure essentially the dawn-dusk component of\nthe convection velocity. The Hankasalmi beam 14 and the\nPikkvib\u00e6r beam 2 are the beams on which the Cluster foot-\nprint is located during this period (black and white lines in\nthe middle and bottom panels). For both radars, the l-o-s\nvelocity shows cusp echoes, and the time period can be sub-\ndivided into the same three intervals as for the Cluster data.\nBefore 05:27 UT and after 05:48\u201305:50 UT, the two radars\n148 A.

Between 05:27 and 05:48 UT,\ni.e. during the period of stronger negative IMF By , they show\nduskward (negative) velocities. During the whole interval\n05:15\u201306:15 UT, the plasma velocity is fairly weak, less than\n600 m s\u22121, probably due to the quiet conditions prevailing\nduring the overall period. The cusp echoes are located at\nlarge ranges, between 09:30 and 12:30 MLT and between 74\u25e6\nand 82\u25e6 MLAT. The dawnward and southward rotation of the\nIMF is too short for a clear equatorward motion of the cusp\nechoes to be observed, as expected for a southward IMF ex-\ncursion.\nA. Marchaudon et al.: Transient plasma injections in the dayside magnetosphere 149\nDuring the interval of duskward convection velocity, each\nradar observes strong flow enhancements (flow bursts) also\nmoving duskward, with an increased velocity. These bursts\nare typical ionospheric signatures of plasma injection events\n(Pinnock et al., 1995). Therefore, the two radars observe dif-\nferent flow bursts, with those of Hankasalmi being located\nover the Cluster footprint track, while those of Pikkvib\u00e6r are\ncloser to the radar. Then the flow bursts detected simultane-\nously by the two radars do not represent the same structure.\nThis also explains why, in the range-time velocity plots of\nFig. 6, the shapes of the velocity flow bursts are different\nfor the two radars. The range-time slope of the bursts in the\nPikkvib\u00e6r beam clearly indicates a predominantly duskward\nmotion of the burst, whereas no clear motion of the veloc-\nity structures is observed along the Hankasalmi beams. Al-\nthough no echoes are observed by the Pikkvib\u00e6r radar at\nthe Cluster position, the flow bursts observed at closer range\ngates should reach the Cluster footprint after the end of the\nnegative IMF By period. On the contrary, the flow bursts ob-\nserved by the Hankasalmi radar pass the Cluster position at\nthe beginning of their lifetime during the negative IMF By\nperiod. Therefore, we will later compare only the convection\ndata from the Hankasalmi radar with Cluster. The Pikkvib\u00e6r\ndata can be used only to demonstrate the global scale of the\nchanges in the ionospheric convection observed at the Clus-\nter footprint by the Hankasalmi radar, and that the negative\nIMF By period is associated with several injections.\nFigure 6 also indicates that the amplitude of the backscat-\ntered signal is weak during the periods of dawnward ve-\nlocity before 05:25 UT and after 05:51 UT. Between 05:25\nand 05:51 UT, the amplitude increases strongly, particularly\nwithin the velocity flow bursts, possibly due to intense par-\nticle precipitation related to upward field-aligned currents.\nIn the range-time backscattered power plots, the flow bursts\nare characterized by a time dispersion on both radars, con-\ntrary to the velocity structures, where no clear dispersion is\nseen on the Hankasalmi beams. Two structures are observed\non the Pikkvib\u00e6r radars and three on the Hankasalmi radars\n(see the three black lines in the top two panels), with the\nfirst two being hardly separated. The backscattered power is\nlarger along the Pikkvib\u00e6r beams than along the Hankasalmi\nbeams, and the shape of the structures varies between the two\nradars, which again confirms that the flow bursts seen by the\ntwo radars are different. From the slope of the three power\nstructures observed with the Hankasalmi radar, it will be pos-\nsible to derive the velocity of the flow bursts structures and\nto compare it with the velocity of plasma structures observed\nat Cluster and projected into the ionosphere.\n5 Comparison between SuperDARN and Cluster\n5.1 Plasma convection velocity\nIn this section, we present a detailed comparison between\nthe convection velocity measured in the ionosphere by Su-\nperDARN and in the magnetosphere by Cluster. For map-\nping the Cluster velocity into the ionosphere, magnetic field\nlines are assumed to be equipotential and the Tsyganenko\nT96 model (Tsyganenko, 1995) is used with inputs of IMF\nand solar wind data measured by ACE and lagged by 86 min.\nEach data point of perpendicular ion velocity measured by\nthe CIS instrument on Cluster 1 is projected along magnetic\nfield lines into the ionosphere and then compared with Su-\nperDARN radial velocities at the Cluster footprint location.\nWe checked the validity of the T96 model by comparing the\nmagnetic field vectors obtained by the model at the Cluster\nposition and by the FGM instrument. The agreement is good\nwithin less than 15% in amplitude and 5\u25e6 in direction.\nThe comparison of plasma convection velocity at Cluster\nand SuperDARN is shown in Fig. 7. Panel (a) presents the\ntime variation of the CIS ion perpendicular velocity in the\nform of vectors at the Cluster position. Each vector repre-\nsents the perpendicular-to-B component of the plasma con-\nvection velocity projected onto the XY GSE plane. Because\nthe local magnetic field is close to the zGSE direction, the\n\u2212yGSE component is mainly dawnward. Panel (b) shows\nthe same data after projection into the ionosphere at 250 km\naltitude, where Vwest and Vnorth correspond to the veloc-\nity components in the magnetic west and north directions in\nAACGM coordinates. For comparison, panel (c) displays the\nrange-time plot of the l-o-s velocity for the Hankasalmi beam\n14 with the Cluster footprint (black line). In order to better il-\nlustrate the correlation between the Cluster and SuperDARN\nvelocities, the mapped CIS velocity is first averaged with a\nrunning mean over one minute (the time resolution of Su-\nperDARN measurements), and then projected along the di-\nrection of the Hankasalmi beam 14 and plotted in panel (d),\ntogether with the velocity measured in the appropriate Super-\nDARN range gate where the Cluster footprint is located (red\nsegments).\nThe correlation between satellite and radar convection ve-\nlocity is satisfactory, particularly if a short delay of 2 min\nbetween Cluster and SuperDARN is allowed. This is the rea-\nson why the Cluster data are plotted for the 05:15\u201306:00 UT\nperiod (panels (a) and (b)) whereas the SuperDARN data and\nthe SuperDARN-Cluster correlation are plotted at the iono-\nspheric time for the 05:17\u201306:02 UT period (panels (c) and\n(d)). At the range gate of the Cluster footprint, the direction\nof the beam 14 of Hankasalmi is close to dawn-dusk (west-\neast), making positive velocities essentially dawnward and\nnegative velocities duskward. Except for the short interval\nof dawnward velocities measured by Cluster between 05:35\nand 05:36 UT (panels (a) and (b)) which is not observed by\nSuperDARN, probably because this structure is too short to\nbe detected by SuperDARN with its 1-min resolution, Super-\nDARN and Cluster show the same global behaviour of the\neast-west component of the convection. A first dawn-to-dusk\nreversal at 05:34 UT (Cluster time) is followed by a step in-\ncrease of the duskward velocity at 05:36 UT after which three\nduskward intensifications between 05:36 and 05:46 UT are\nassociated with the injections (see below) and followed again\nby a dusk-to-dawn reversal at 05:46 UT. The last dawn-to-\ndusk reversal observed at Cluster at 05:56 UT is not observed\n150 A.

The SuperDARN velocity is the radial velocity measured at\nthe Cluster footprint.\nat the same location by SuperDARN, but about one range\ngate (45 km) westward of the Cluster footprint (panel (c)).\nHowever, this discrepancy remains within the error range,\nsince the uncertainty of the Cluster footprint with respect to\nthe SuperDARN pattern is as large as \u00b14 gates (\u00b1180 km).\nThis evaluation takes into account model-dependent uncer-\ntainties in mapping Cluster to the ionosphere and range un-\ncertainties in the localization of SuperDARN echoes for large\nranges. Detailed examination of the 05:36\u201305:46 UT inter-\nval shows that the three duskward intensifications observed\nby Cluster (mentioned above) are also observed by Super-\nDARN, although the one-minute time resolution of the radars\nA. Marchaudon et al.: Transient plasma injections in the dayside magnetosphere 151\nTable 1. Comparison of the velocity of plasma structures (phase velocity) measured by Cluster and SuperDARN. The Cluster velocity has\nbeen deduced from FGM data (first row) and mapped into the ionosphere with T96 model (second row) and projected along beam 14 of the\nHankasalmi radar (third row). The SuperDARN phase velocity is deduced from the slope of the backscattered power in the range-time plot\nof beam 14 of the Hankasalmi radar (bottom row). The different observation times at Cluster and at SuperDARN is due to the propagation\nfrom the magnetosphere to the ionosphere\nCluster structures Burst 1 Burst 2 Burst 3\n05:38:00 UT 05:39:30 UT 05:42:30 UT\nHigh-altitude velocity 7.5 km s\u22121 15.4 km s\u22121 10.8 km s\u22121\n(from FGM data)\nHigh-altitude velocity 295 m s\u22121 640 m s\u22121 405 m s\u22121\nionospheric projection\nVelocity component 395 m s\u22121 645 m s\u22121 590 m s\u22121\nalong Hankasalmi beam 14\nSuperDARN structures Burst 1 Burst 2 Burst 3\n05:40:00 UT 05:41:30 UT 05:45:00 UT\nIonospheric velocity 420 m s\u22121 710 m s\u22121 650 m s\u22121\nSuperDARN data\ndoes not allow one to separate clearly the first two. Only\nthe third velocity burst is clearly separated by both instru-\nments. Moreover, during this interval of negative velocities,\na general decrease in the amplitude of the velocity is also\nobserved by both instruments. The average velocity (panel\n6(d)) is systematically larger when deduced from the CIS\ndata (up to 1000 m s\u22121) than when measured by SuperDARN\n(up to 600 m s\u22121). This difference can possibly be explained\nby the uncertainty in the mapping of the static electric field\nfrom Cluster to the ionosphere and by the fairly large spatial\nsmoothing in the SuperDARN data.\n5.2 Velocity of plasma structures\nIndependent of convection velocity, we can also compare\nthe velocity of plasma structures (hereafter named phase ve-\nlocity) observed at Cluster and the velocity of correlated\nplasma structures in the ionosphere. This comparison is\nlimited to the interval of duskward convection velocity be-\ntween 05:36 and 05:46 UT (Cluster time), during which well-\ndefined plasma structures associated with the injections are\ndetected. In the magnetosphere, the phase velocity of the\nplasma structures is deduced from the simultaneous four-\npoint Cluster FGM data and in the ionosphere from the slope\nof the range-time SuperDARN power plots (Fig. 6). At the\nCluster altitude, each drifting plasma structure is character-\nized by mostly similar magnetic and particle signatures on\nthe four spacecraft, assuming the size of the structure is\nlarger than the spacecraft separation (\u223c600 km). Magnetic\nsignatures from FGM have been preferred because of their\nhigher time resolution and because the magnetic field vari-\nations directly reflect the structure of the plasma injection\ntube (diamagnetism affecting the parallel component) and\nthe presence of parallel currents (affecting the direction of the\nmagnetic field) (Southwood, 1987; Lockwood et al., 2001a).\nHowever, we have checked that the phase velocity deduced\nby the same method, but from the electron density profiles\nmeasured by the four WHISPER instruments, is very similar\n(not shown). We have chosen a coordinate system in which\nthe z direction is along the mean field direction (averaged\nover a 2\u20133 min period around the event). The x and y di-\nrections are given by the maximum and minimum variance\nin the perpendicular component. Because Cluster is situated\nat about 8RE , this coordinate system has been preferred to\nthe usual L, M , N system used when observations are made\nclose to the magnetopause (Russell and Elphic, 1978).\nThe parallel and maximum variance components, together\nwith the ion density and parallel velocity given by CIS, are\nplotted for the 05:36\u201305:46 UT interval in Fig. 8. Three\nminima are observed in the parallel component of the mag-\nnetic field (shaded zones) superposed on the large scale de-\ncrease due to the motion of the spacecraft and correlated with\ndensity maxima. Each of them is associated with a bipo-\nlar signature in the perpendicular component of the magnetic\nfield, suggestive of a pair of field-aligned currents of opposite\nsigns, and with a sharp gradient in the parallel velocity. All\nthese signatures are typical of plasma injections and FTEs\n(Russell and Elphic, 1978; Paschmann et al., 1982).\nIn order to calculate the phase velocity of these three struc-\ntures in the magnetosphere, we have identified similar fea-\ntures on each spacecraft. As an example, Fig. 9 shows the\nmagnetic field signatures of the third event, in the direction\nof the mean magnetic field and in the direction of maximum\nperpendicular variance. Arrows on Fig. 9 show identified\nsimilar features. Assuming a plane structure with a uniform\nvelocity through the four Cluster satellites, we determined\nthe velocity of the plane along its normal from the time de-\nlay between the observation of similar signatures at the dif-\n152 A.

This perpendicular\nvelocity is then mapped into the ionosphere with the Tsyga-\nnenko T96 model. Finally, the Cluster projected velocity is\ncompared with the velocity of the SuperDARN ionospheric\nsignature of the flow burst by projecting the phase velocity\nalong the Hankasalmi beam 14 and assuming a 2\u20133 min de-\nlay between the structures observed by Cluster and by Super-\nDARN (as for the plasma convection velocity). The results\nare presented in Fig. 10. The top row shows for each event\nthe phase velocity at the Cluster location in the plane per-\npendicular to the magnetic field, together with the relative\npositions of the four spacecraft. The bottom row shows the\nvelocity projected into the ionosphere with the direction of\nbeam 14 of the Hankasalmi radar. The first and third struc-\ntures move equatorward and eastward, whereas the second\nstructure moves essentially eastward. As it was the case for\nconvection velocity, the Pikkvib\u00e6r data cannot be used to de-\ntermine a second component of the phase velocity, and there-\nfore, we are limited to one single component, along the Han-\nkasalmi beam 14 for the comparison.

Notice that\nthe apparent (phase) velocity of a plane structure along any\ndirection is larger than the velocity along the normal to the\nstructure. The last line gives the SuperDARN radial phase\nvelocity obtained from a linear least-square fit to the slope of\nthe backscattered power (Fig. 6b). Surprisingly, for all three\nevents, the agreement between the two independent determi-\nnations of the phase velocity is excellent, owing to the large\nuncertainties (\u223c20%) of each determination.\n6 Discussion\n6.1 Plasma convection velocity and phase velocity of the\nflow events\nIn the Southwood (1987) model of the ionospheric signature\nof FTEs, the plasma convection velocity is equal to the ve-\nlocity of the flux tube, because of plasma incompressibility.\nAny discrepancy between these two velocities should then\nbe attributed to a phase effect, for instance, related to the\nmotion of the reconnection site on the magnetopause. From\nSuperDARN, the plasma convection velocity inside the three\nflow events remains relatively stable in amplitude between\n350 and 500 m s\u22121, and the phase velocity is between 400\nand 700 m s\u22121 (see Table 1). Therefore, the plasma convec-\ntion velocity is almost equal to the phase velocity for the first\nflow burst and is half of it for the last two events. These re-\nsults are in good agreement with those obtained by Provan\net al. (1998) and particularly by McWilliams et al. (2001),\nwho also found that during the first half of the lifetime of a\npulsed ionospheric flow, its phase velocity is twice the con-\nvection velocity, with both velocities being measured in the\nionosphere. The main difference between our results and the\ntwo papers listed above is that in our case, there are lower\nvalues of the plasma flow and phase velocities, which can\nbe explained by the low solar wind pressure associated with\nthe dominant northward IMF. On the contrary at Cluster, the\nplasma velocity measured by CIS appears larger than the\nphase velocity in two of the bursts (respectively, 25 km s\u22121\nand 20 km s\u22121 in bursts 2 and 3) and slightly smaller in burst\n1. So, the mean ratio between the plasma velocity and the\nphase velocity reverses between Cluster and the ionosphere.\nHowever, this result must be considered with care, owing to\nthe fairly large uncertainty of the phase velocity determina-\ntions. Furthermore, the bursts observed at Cluster are char-\nacterised by large gradients in the plasma velocity.\n6.2 Flow events dimensions\nHere, we evaluate and compare the ionospheric dimensions\nof the three flow events. Using the power data of the Han-\nkasalmi radar, and by identifying the number of beams, as\nwell as the number of gates for each beam where the struc-\ntures are observed, the north-south and east-west dimensions\nof the flux tubes can be obtained. Since the structures are\nobserved on 2 beams and on 1 or 2 gates for each beam, their\ntypical dimensions are about 300 km in the north-south direc-\ntion and 45\u201390 km in the east-west direction. Although these\nionospheric dimensions are characteristic of reconnected flux\ntubes, the north-south elongation of the structures are un-\nusual (Provan et al., 1998; McWilliams et al., 2001). Be-\ncause the structures are moving in the east-west direction,\nthe flow events move over the Cluster satellites along their\nsmaller dimension. This result supports the hypothesis of a\nplane structure used for the determination of the phase veloc-\nity at Cluster. At the Cluster altitude, the east-west smaller\ndimension of the reconnected flux tubes can be evaluated to\n\u223c700\u20131500 km (given by the product of the phase velocity of\nthe structure by the time during which Cluster remains inside\nthe structure). Now, we can compare the east-west dimen-\nsion of each ionospheric structure observed by the radar with\nthe dimension deduced from Cluster data and mapped into\nthe ionosphere. The ionospheric dimension in the east-west\ndirection of each injection, as deduced from Cluster data, is\n\u223c30 km for the first, \u223c60 km for the second, and \u223c40 km for\nthe third. These dimensions are slightly smaller than those\ndetermined from the SuperDARN data, but owing to their\npoor spatial resolution, the comparison is quite satisfactory\nand adds consistency to the comparison between the convec-\ntion and phase velocities made in the previous sections.\n6.3 Global ionospheric convection and location of the re-\nconnection site\nIn order to replace the previous results with respect to the\nlarge-scale ionospheric flow pattern and then to infer the lo-\n154 A.

Phase velocity vector of three injections events determined from Cluster FGM and associated with flow bursts observed by Super-\nDARN. Top: at the Cluster location in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field and in GSE coordinates with the relative position of the\nfour spacecraft. Bottom: projection of the Cluster velocity into the ionosphere in AACGM coordinates. The direction of beam 14 of the\nHankasalmi radar at the Cluster footprint is also shown.\ncation of the reconnection site, we have employed the \u201cmap\npotential\u201d technique developed by Ruohoniemi and Baker\n(1998). This technique yields large-scale global convec-\ntion maps from the l-o-s velocity measurements by multi-\nple radars, via mathematical fitting of the data, to an ex-\npansion of the electrostatic potential in spherical harmonics.\nFirst, the l-o-s data are filtered and then mapped onto a polar\ngrid. These \u201cgridded\u201d measurements are then used to deter-\nmine the most consistent electrostatic potential distribution.\nThe iso-potential lines represent the plasma streamlines of\nthe convection. Since l-o-s velocity measurements are not\nalways available, information from the statistical model of\nRuohoniemi and Greenwald (1996), parameterised by IMF\nconditions, is used to stabilise the solution where no mea-\nsurements are made. Two of these global maps are plotted\nin Fig. 11 to show the variations of the global ionospheric\nconvection.\nDuring the interval 04:40\u201305:25 UT, when the IMFBy and\nBz are positive, before the observations described in this pa-\nper, the Cluster footprint is located close to the Hankasalmi\nradar echoes, and both instruments observe repeated plasma\ninjection signatures. These injections observed by Cluster\nwere already mentioned in Sect. 4.2. The global convection\nmap at 05:03\u201305:04 UT (Fig. 11a) shows an almost circu-\nlar clockwise cell, centred close to the magnetic pole. The\nconvection velocity is largest in the dawn sector between\n06:00 and 12:00 MLT. The plasma in the cusp region around\nnoon is purely dawnward, indicating the strong control of\nthe dayside convection by the positive IMF By component.\nSince the IMF Bz component is positive, this central cell can\nbe the lobe cell driven by reconnection on the high-latitude\nmagnetopause, tailward of the cusp region, as expected from\nthe anti-parallel merging concept of the associated three-cell\nmodel of Cowley and Lockwood (1992) for positive IMF By\nand Bz. From this model, the reconnection site is probably\nlocated on the dusk side of the northern lobe. Two classical\nviscous cells are also expected on both sides of a single lobe\ncell. In Fig. 11a, only the dawn side cell is clearly observed,\nprobably because very few radar echoes are obtained on the\ndusk side ionosphere below 75\u25e6 MLAT. The reduced size of\nthe polar cap and the small convection velocity, both due to\nthe northward IMF, can explain why the radars do not de-\ntect the sunward return flow on the equatorward sides of the\ntwo viscous cells expected around 75\u25e6 MLAT, between 03:00\nand 09:00 MLT on the morningside and between 15:00 and\n21:00 MLT on the eveningside.\nBetween 05:27 and 05:37 UT, an important reorganisation\nof the convection occurs, with a strong decrease in the plasma\nA.

Then between\n05:37 and 05:48 UT, during the time interval studied in this\npaper, the convection velocity in the cusp increases again but\nthe ionospheric flow turns suddenly duskward, as shown by\nthe global convection map at 05:39\u201305:40 UT in Fig. 11b.\nIn particular, the flow bursts in the polar cusp are injected in\nthe pre-noon sector between 11:00 and 12:00 MLT and are\ndragged duskward. Moreover, a large duskside cell is also\nobserved with a clear crescent-shape due to magnetic tension\neffect. These observations confirm that even during this pe-\nriod of negative Bz, the global dayside convection contin-\nues to be controlled by the IMF By . Several other charac-\nteristics are in agreement with a negative IMF Bz, such as\nthe lower latitude (74\u25e6 MLAT) of the flow bursts appearance,\nthe global convection pattern extending to slightly lower lat-\nitudes in the dayside and displaying the well-known two-cell\ncirculation. These observations support a reconnection on\nthe low-latitude dayside magnetopause. However, the phase\nvelocity of two of the flow bursts determined from Cluster\ndata (Fig. 10) shows a southward component, which could\nbe interpreted as indicating a reconnection site on the high-\nlatitude magnetopause, tailward of the cusp (Maezawa, 1976;\n156 A. Marchaudon et al.: Transient plasma injections in the dayside magnetosphere\nCrooker, 1979; Sandholt et al., 1992). A possibility is that\nbecause the convection is clearly controlled by the IMF By ,\nthe reconnection site could be located on the dawn flank of\nthe magnetopause (|By | > |Bz|) (Crooker, 1979, 1988) and\nneither on the high- nor on the low-latitude magnetopause.\nAfter 05:48 UT, the convection velocity in the cusp turns\ndawnward again. A clockwise central cell reappears with the\nsame characteristics as during the interval 04:40\u201305:27 UT,\nconfirming the return to a positive IMF By and Bz convection\npattern and a reconnection site on the high-latitude magne-\ntopause.\n7 Conclusion\nA conjunction between the Cluster spacecraft in the dayside\nexternal cusp and the SuperDARN radars in the ionosphere\nallows one to compare the plasma convection velocity and\nthe drift velocity of plasma injection structures at the two lo-\ncations. We have first compared convection velocity in the\nmagnetosphere and in the ionosphere. The convection pat-\ntern is dominated by the IMF By component and reacts al-\nmost instantaneously to its variations. The comparison be-\ntween the convection directions at both locations is satisfac-\ntory, if one assumes a 2\u20133 min delay between the cusp at\n7\u20138RE altitude and the ionosphere. The convection veloc-\nity measured at Cluster after mapping into the ionosphere,\nis systematically about 1.5 times larger than at SuperDARN,\nbut the relative variations are at both locations very consis-\ntent.\nThe most important result is the clear one-to-one corre-\nlation observed between three successive particle injection\nstructures, each associated with magnetic bipolar signatures\ntypical of FTEs, and three subsequent bursts of enhanced\nconvection observed in the ionosphere. The best correla-\ntion is achieved when a time delay of 2\u20133 min is applied\nbetween the 7\u20138RE altitude and the ionosphere. Evalua-\ntion of the drift (phase) velocity at Cluster (7.5\u201315 km s\u22121, or\n400\u2013600 m s\u22121 when mapped into the ionosphere) and of the\nphase velocity of the associated flow bursts in the ionosphere\ngives similar results. From SuperDARN measurements, de-\npending on the flow bursts, the phase velocity varies from\nequal to twice the convection velocity and is in agreement\nwith previous works (Provan et al., 1998; McWilliams et\nal., 2001). On the contrary at Cluster, the phase velocity is\nsmaller than the convection velocity. The size of reconnected\nflux tubes at Cluster and of their elongated counterpart in the\nionosphere has been evaluated. From SuperDARN HF radar,\nthe size at ionospheric altitudes is of the order of 45\u201390 km\nin the east-west direction and elongated up to \u223c300 km in\nthe north-south direction. The ionospheric east-west dimen-\nsions evaluated at Cluster are consistent, although smaller\n(30\u201360 km). Thus, we may suggest that, during a \u223c15-min\ninterval of IMF pointing southward-dawnward, simultaneous\nmagnetospheric transient observations at Cluster, i.e. spo-\nradic particle injections within newly-opened flux tubes mov-\ning eastward, and in the ionosphere, i.e. transient flow bursts\nmoving duskward, are related signatures of a pulsed mag-\nnetic reconnection occurring on the dawn flank of the mag-\nnetopause.\nAcknowledgements.
