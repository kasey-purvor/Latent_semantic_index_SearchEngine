SYSTEM MODEL FOR LOG-NORMAL FADING CHANNEL\nIn wireless communications, medium-scale fading is usually\nmodelled as a multiplicative and slowly time varying random\nprocess. The received signal r(t) can be expressed as [1]\nwhere ( is the average transmitted signal energy, s(t) is\nthe transmitted signal, h(t) is the random process that char-\nacterizes the medium-scale fading, and n(t) is an additive\nwhite gaussian noise process with a double-sided variance of\nNo\/2. The medium-scale fading is considered as log-normally\ndistributed for any t value. In a slow-varying environment,\nh(t) can be considered constant over multiple symbol periods\nsuch that h(t) = {3 is a log-normally distributed Random\nVariable (RV). The multipath attenuation factors of the channel\nmodel released by the IEEE for indoor communications in\nwell-know integral formulation by less than 0.01 nats\/sIHz\nfor any SNR and dB spread values lying in the range of\ninterest for wireless communications. We first derive in Section\nIII two very tight closed-form approximations of the integral\nformulation of the ergodic capacity for low and high dB spread\nvalues, respectively. Our results show that the closed-form ex-\npression derived for low dB spread is an absolute lower bound\non the ergodic capacity, Le., it is expressed independently of\nthe dB spread. We then design a parametric function based\non hyperbolic functions that best fits the difference between\nthe exact ergodic capacity and its absolute lower bound. In\nSection IV, we obtain an accurate closed-form approximation\nof the ergodic capacity, which is a function of the SNR of the\nsystem and the dB spread of the log-normal fading channel,\nby minimizing this difference. Our closed-form expression is\nsimpler than the computable formula proposed in [4] and\nfar more accurate than the expression derived in [11], for\nevaluating the channel capacities of communication systems\nover log-normal fading channels. We also use our expression\nto interpret the behaviour of the capacity at high SNRs and\ncompute the ergodic capacities of Single-Input-Single-Output\n(SISO) and Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) UWB sys-\ntems operating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel in Section V.\nFinally, conclusions are drawn in Section VI.\n(1)r(t) = JEs(t)h(t) + n(t),\nAbstract-The log-normal probability distribution is com-\nmonly used in wireless communications to model the shadowing\nand, more recently, the small-scale fading for indoor u1tra-wide-\nband communications. In this paper, an accurate closed-form\napproximation of the ergodic capacity over log-normal fading\nchannels is derived. This expression can be easily used to evaluate\nand compare the ergodic capacity of communication systems\noperating over log-normal fading channels.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe log-normal distribution has long been used predomi-\nnantly in communications to model the effect of shadowing,\nLe., medium-scale fading, due to large obstructions [1]. Re-\ncently, the log-normal distribution has been applied to describe\nthe small-scale fading of the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model\n[2], for indoor Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) communications [3].\nAnd more generally, the amplitude distribution of slowly\nvarying communication channels, e.g., indoor environments,\ntends to be log-normal [4].\nChannel capacity and probability of error are common\nmetrics used to evaluate the performance of communication\nsystems. The derivations of the channel capacity and the prob-\nability of error over typical fading channels, such as Rayleigh\nand Rician, have attracted considerable research interests over\nthe past decade, [5]-[8]. The error probability of communica-\ntion systems operating over log-normal fading channels was\ncommonly expressed using a computable formula in [8] until\nan accurate closed-form approximation was derived in [9]. As\nfor the capacity, it was first upper and lower bounded in [10],\nfor log-normally distributed shadowing. These two bounds\nare closed-form expressions but unfortunately are loose for\nlow Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) values. Recently in [4], an\naccurate computable formula, which is the truncation of an\ninfinite alternating series and therefore is not a closed-form\nexpression, was proposed to evaluate the ergodic capacity over\na log-normal channel. This work was then extended in [11]\nand a closed-form approximation of the ergodic capacity was\nobtained. However, as it is evidently shown later in the paper,\nthis expression is inaccurate for low SNR and high dB spread\nvalues of the log-normal distribution.\nIn this paper, we derive a closed-form approximation of the\nergodic capacity over log-normal fading channels, relying on\nthe system model proposed in Section II. It differs from the\n978-1-4244-2644-7\/08\/$25.00 \u00a92008 IEEE\nIII. TIGHT ApPROXIMATIONS OF THE INTEGRAL OF f(x)\nThe integral part of (6) is equivalent to1:00 j(x)dx = 1+00 [f(-x) + f(x)]dx. (7)\nFor any value of k, using (7) and the integration by parts\ndefined as J: w(x) d~~x) dx = [w(x)y(x)]~ - J: dq~X) y(x)dx,\nwith w(x) = In (cosh (\u00b1x+km)) dy(x) = ..Le- x and hence2k 'dx y'1i\nd~~X) = \u00b1 21k tanh ( \u00b1xikkm ), y (x) = erf(x), the ergodic\n(2) capacity in (6) can be re-expressed as follows\n(+oo\nCe = E[ln(l + 'Ya )] = 2A io In(l + 'Ya)p(a)da,\n[2], namely the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model, exhibit a log-\nnormal distribution. In this case, the received signal r(t) can\nbe expressed as in (1) with h(t) = El Gl8(t - Tl), as shown\nin [12] and [13], where 8(t) denotes the Dirac delta function,\nGl = \/3le jOl is the l-th multipath attenuation, Tl is its respective\ntime delay factor, \/3l is a log-normal RV, and (h E {O, 7r} [2].\nThe ergodic capacity of the log-normal fading channel can\nbe expressed as follows [10]\n(12)\nCe(k, m) =A {(21n(2)+m)+ [erf(x) {In (COSh ( -x::m))\n( ( x+km))}]+oo 1 (+oo+ In cosh 2k 0 + 2k io erf(x)\n( ( -x+km) (x+km))}x tanh 2k - tanh 2k dx\nA (+oo\n= Am + 2k io g(x)dx,\n(8)\nwhere g(x) = erf(x) (tanh (-Xikkm ) - tanh (xt~m)) + 2,\nand erf(x) is the error function. We also know that tanh(ax) is\na good approximation of erf(x), for any x E [0, +00) and a E\n[1.1,1.3]. Using this approximation, we obtain g(x) ~ g(x) =\ntanh(ax) (tanh ( -Xikkm ) - tanh ( xtZm))+2. Knowing that\ntanh(x) = 1- 2\/(exp (2x) +1) = -1 + 2\/(exp (-2x) +1),\nCe(k, m) can be approximated by substituting g(x) with g(x)\nin (8), as follows\nCe(k,m) ~ Am+ ~k {+oo [(1- 2 2 )( x 1io e ax +1 e 7C - m +1\n+ x +1 -1) + 1] dx.\ne 7C m + 1\n(9)\nApplying the change of variable u = eX in (9) and after some\nsimplifications, (9) can be re-expressed as follows\nCe(k,m) ~ 2A [(1 + 2~k) In(2) + ; + In (COSh (;))]\n_ 2A {+oo ( 1 + 1 ) du,\nk 11 p(u, m, k, a) p(u, -m, k, a)\n(10)\nwhere p(u, m, k, a) is a polynomial given by\np(u,m,k,a) =u(emu2a+t +u2a +emut +1). (11)\n(3)\nThe integral part in (10) can be solved by expanding the\nrational functions l\/p(u, \u00b1m,k, a) into partial fractions.\nThe expression in (10) is a generic and accurate closed-form\napproximation of the ergodic capacity as long as the roots of\np(u, m, k, a) in (11) can be obtained. Using this expression,\nwe derive a simpler expression that is a tight approximation\nof Ce(k, m) for k \u00bb 1, or equivalently ay \u00ab 1 dB. In the\n(6) case of k \u00bb 1, the integral part in (10) becomes negligible,\nand (10) can simply be re-expressed as\nCe,o(m) = 2A [In(2) + ; + In (cosh (;) ) ] .\n(4)\n( ) _ 1 ( 1 (In (Q) - m a ) 2)P Q - exp --Q~aa 2 aa '\nwhere'Y = fiNo is the average SNR, A = ! if the capacity\nis expressed in (nats\/slHz) or A = 21~(2) if the capacity is\nexpressed in (bits\/slHz), and p(Q) is the probability density\nfunction (pdt) of a log-normally distributed RV Q, given by\nwith m a and 0'0. being the mean and standard deviation of\nQ, respectively. The RV Q = \/32 for medium-scale fading,\nand Q ~ El \/31 for the indoor UWB channel, as shown in\n[12] and [13]. Using the results in [14] and [15], El\/31 can\nbe considered as a log-normally distributed RV since both \/3\nand \/32 are log-normally distributed [13]. Thus, the ergodic\ncapacity formula in (2) can be applied to the medium-scale\nfading and to the indoor UWB channel. In wireless commu-\nnications, parameters (my, ay) are introduced to characterize\na log-normal distribution, where my = Bma, ay = Baa\nand B = 10\/ In (10) [14]. The parameter a y , known as the\ndB spread, is between 6 and 12 dB for medium-scale fading\n[14] and between 2 and 5 dB for the indoor UWB channel\n[2]. Without loss of generality, its range of values can be\naggregated as a y E [2,12] for most communication systems\noperating over lo~-normal fading channels.

AN ACCURATE CLOSED-FORM ApPROXIMATION OF\nTHE ERGODIC CAPACITY\nThe tightness of \u00a2(k, m), or equivalently \u00a2(ay, ,(dB)), in\n(16) can be adjusted by using the parameters 'f}o, 'f}1 and 'f}2.\nOur method for finding a very tight approximation of the\nergodic capacity in (6) by Ce,o(,(dB)) + \u00a2(ay, ,(dB)) is to\nminimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) criterion given by\n2N\n1\n+ 1 t ICe(cry, ,(dB)) - te,o (r(dB))\n,(dB)=-N (17)\n+ j;;y e-'11 ln [cosh ( -Y(~h~:Y)] ) 12 -::: co,\nwhere cO \u00ab 1. Notice that my is a term that shifts the\nSNR value, Le., it sets the origin of the SNR. Using this\nMSE criterion, we have obtained 'f}o, 'f}1, and 'f}2, considering\n(13)\nrespectively. Consequently, an accurate closed-form approxi-\nmation of the ergodic c~acity can ~e obtained by substituting\nf( -x) and f(x) with f( -x) and f(x) in (7) as follows\nCe(k,m) ~ 2Aln(2) +Am\n1+00 (x - km ) 2 2+A - In(2) _e-x dx,k(21n(2)+m) 2k Jjr\n1+00 (x + km ) 2 2+A - In(2) _e- x dx.k(21n(2)-m) 2k Jjr\n(14)\nAfter some simplifications, it can be read as follows\nFor k = 3, Ce(k, m) and Ce,o(m) differ by less than 0.01\nnats\/slHz for any m value. This difference decreases as k goes\nto infinity, or reciprocally a y goes to zero, as shown in Figs. 1\nand 2. Notice also that Ce,o(m) is independent of k, and thus\nCe,o (m) is an absolute lower bound of the ergodic capacity\nover log-normal fading channels.\nIn the case of k \u00ab 1, or equivalently a y \u00bb 1 dB, the\nfunctions f( -x) and f(x) can be tightly approximated by\n!(-x) and !(x) =\n(\nX - km ) 2 22k -In(2) Jjre-x ,xE[k(21n(2)+m),+oo),\n(\nX +km ) 2 22k -In(2) Jjre- x ,xE[k(21n(2)-m),+oo),\no ,otherwise,\n,for MRC,\n.. \"':'''''''\n....:....

The mean ma and standard deviation aa of the equivalent\nlog-normal RV Q have been obtained for different numbers of\ntransmit antennae and using either EGC or MRC, in Tables\n4.2, 4.3,5.1 and 5.2 of [16]. Inserting these values of m a and\naa in (19), we plot in Figs. 4 and 5 the ergodic capacities\nof SISO and MISO-UWB systems, respectively, over various\nchannel scenarios, Le., CMI-4, of [2], applying either EGC\nor MRC, for Nf = 20 and Nr = 1. Fig. 4 depicts that MRC\nprovides always an extra 0.2 nats\/slHz capacity improvement\ncompared to EGC, and that the capacity over the Line-Of-Sight\n(LOS) channel scenario CMl is 1.2 nats\/sIHz higher than the\ncapacity over the worst non-LOS channel scenario CM4. Fig.\n5 shows that adding extra transmit antennae allows a small\ncapacity improvement of around 0.2 nats\/sIHz at the SNR of\n30 dB. These results are consistent with the results obtained\nin [17] for Rayleigh fading channel.\nOur expressions in (12) and (15) can also be used to\ninterpret the behaviour of the ergodic capacity Ce (k, m) at\nhigh SNRs. Assuming in (12) that m \u00bb 1, or equivalently\nc~ = 2A {In (2 cosh (\"((dB~; my ) ) +2~ [\"((dB) +my\nay1]o h-111 (,,(dB) +my )]}\n+ J2 cos 2B1]2 '\n(18)\nwhich differs from Ce in (2) by less than 2.10-4\nnats\/sIHz for any a y E [0.01,6) and by less than\n8.10-3 nats\/sIHz for any a y E [6,12], and for any\n,,(dB) value. In Fig 3, we compare our closed-form\napproximation C~ in (18) with Ce in (2) and the closed-form\napproximation C~' = ( 1+ exp ('Y(dB1+my +~) 2) X\n2 2 -!~+2exp ('Y(dB1+my +~)+exp (2'Y(dB1+mu + 2~)]\nproposed in [11] as functions of ,(dB), for various dB spread\nvalues, and my = -a~\/(2B). The graph in Fig. 3 shows a\nhighly tight fitness between Ce and C~ for any dB spread\nvalue and, hence, indicates graphically the accuracy of our\nproposed closed-form approximation in (18). It also depicts\nthat C~' is only accurate for low values of a y and that C~' is\nnot as accurate as our proposed expression C~. Notice that\nthe accuracy of C~ can be improved for lower co values by\nan appropriate choice of the parameters \"10, \"11 and \"12 in (17).\nV. ApPLICATIONS OF C~\nOur closed-form expression in (18) can be used to calculate\neffectively and accurately the ergodic capacity of communi-\ncation systems over log-normal fading channels. For instance,\nwe can easily compute the ergodic capacity of UWB systems\noperating over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model, using the\nmethod proposed in [16] to combine the effect of Nf log-\nnormal multipath attenuation factors into an equivalent log-\nnormal RV.\na y E [0.01,12] with an increment step of 0.1 dB for a y values,\nover a range of SNR ,(dB) = [-N, N], N = 100, with\nco = 5.10-6 , and then interpolated the resulting values for\n1]0, 1]1 and 1]2. The results are as follows:\nFor a y E [0.01,6):\n1]0 = -1.0658.10-4a~ - 0.0019047a~ + 0.083954ay\n-0.0004047,\n1]1 = -0.0160a~ + 0.3180ay + 1.6580,\n1]2 = (0.045ay + 0.385) In (10).\nFor a y E [6,12]:\n1]0 = 8.7552.10-5a~ - 0.0043629a~ + 0.093625ay\n-0.011684,\n1]1 = -0.0080ay .2 + 0.2200ay + 1.9580,\n1]2 = (0.045ay + 0.385) In (10).\nFinally, adding (12) and (16) together and using the values of\n1]0, 1]1 and 1]2 obtained above, we derive a highly tight closed-\nform approximation of the ergodic capacity as follows\n3025201510\n\"((dB)\n5o-5-103025201510\n\"((dB)\no-5-10\n7 7\n.+.

Similarly,\nassuming in (15) that m \u00bb 1, we have Ce,l(k,m) ~\nAm - Am (erf(-km) - erf(km)) _ _ A_e-k2 (m(m-41n(2)))2 ky'(7r) ,\nwhich can be simplified as Ce,l(k, m) ~ 2Am for m\u00bb 11k.\nTherefore, the ergodic capacity of a log-normal fading channel\ncan be simplified at high SNRs as follows\n2ACe ~ 13 (\"((dB) + my). (20)\nThus, the capacity is a linear function of the SNR at high\nSNRs, which is consistent with the results obtained in [18] as\nwell as in Figs. 4 and 5.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nAn accurate closed-form approximation of the ergodic ca-\npacity for wireless communication systems operating over\nlog-normal fading channels has been derived. Our proposed\nclosed-form approximation is the sum of an absolute lower\nbound and a parametric function. Its accuracy has been\nobtained by finding values of 17o, 171 and 172 that minimize\nthe MSE criterion, and it has been shown experimentally\nfor practical SNR and dB spread values. Its application in\nevaluating the ergodic capacities of SISO and MISO-UWB\nsystems over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model has been\npresented. Finally, our results have been used to interpret\nthe behaviour of the ergodic capacity of log-normal fading\nchannels at high SNRs.\nREFERENCES\n[1] 1. Proakis, Digital Communications. 4th ed.
