Manufacturer\nwebsites were investigated and the characteristics of glucometers were examined. 100\nglucometers from 27 manufacturers were analysed. Many glucometers contained\nsimple informatics features and 5 also contained on-device graphing features for users\nto monitor trends. Some manufacturers have extended informatics via external\nsoftware. A small number of glucometers provided knowledge for the user by, for\nexample, simple embedded decision support protocols. However, it is suggested that\nglucometers could better serve as primary care devices through the incorporation of\nmore decision support directly on the device.\n1 Introduction\nThe change in emphasis from acute to primary care is producing a requirement for a\nnew generation of medical monitoring devices. As well as the technical challenges\nthat will need to be overcome, informatics challenges must be met, if device users are\nto obtain full services from such devices. In particular, problems with future point-of-\ncare devices for medical use may result from the inaccuracy, poor transmission,\ngarbled reception or misinterpretation of the information they are designed to provide\n[1]. It is useful therefore, to assess the state-of-the-art in informatics for current\nmedical monitoring devices, of which the most sophisticated and widely used\nexample is the blood glucometer. This paper represents such an assessment, along\nwith a comparison of the state-of-the-art with medical informatics models.\n1.1 Background on Diabetes\nDiabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition characterised by elevated blood glucose due\nto absolute or relative deficiency in insulin. In 2000, it was estimated that there were\n171 million people in the world with diabetes [2]. The classic symptoms of diabetes\ninclude \u201cincreased urinary frequency (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia),\nexcessive hunger (polyphagia) and unexplained weight loss\u201d [3] and these aid in its\ndiagnosis along with a blood test. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes\ntwo main types [3].\nType 1 Diabetes (Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) - is commonly found in\nchildren and adolescents in whom the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient insulin\nto metabolize glucose in the blood thus resulting in hyperglycaemia. Type 2 Diabetes\n(Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus) - usually occurs in adults and is related to\nobesity and unhealthy diets. There is a third type which only affects pregnant women\n- Gestational Diabetes, but this is generally a temporary condition normally resolved 6\nweeks after delivery. However the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes in the future is\nincreased.\n1.2 Monitoring Diabetes\nPatients with diabetes need to monitor their blood glucose regularly as there are risks\nassociated with high blood glucose in the body including: eye damage, leading to\nblindness; kidney damage, leading to renal failure; nerve damage, leading to\nimpotence and foot ulcers which may result in amputation (diabetes is the leading\ncause of non traumatic amputation); ketoacidosis, a high concentration of ketones in\nthe body occurring when the body is unable to metabolize glucose for the cells, thus\nfinding an alternative by using fat and proteins instead; heart disease; stroke; coma -\nin extreme cases [4].\nBlood glucose monitoring for patients can be done through regular visits to their\nhealth professional, however patients can also monitor their own blood glucose\nregularly with a glucometer or glucose meter.\n1.3 Glucometers\nGlucometers are designed for monitoring rather than for diagnosing diabetes. Some\nglucometers require coding, which refers to calibrating the meter to the batch of test\nstrips being used as there is variation between batches of strips. If the glucometer is\nnot calibrated, it will give an incorrect result [5].\nThe blood sample for the test is generally taken from the fingertip as this provides the\nmost accurate result but it also causes the patient the most pain because the fingertips\ncontain many nerve endings. Therefore some glucometers allow the testing of blood\nsamples from other sites and this is known as alternative site testing (AST). The sites\ninclude \u201cupper-arms, thighs, base of the thumb, stomach areas and forearms\u201d [6 - 8].\nA lancet is needed to obtain the blood sample and it has different settings to determine\nthe depth to which the skin will be pierced, which helps in determining the size of\nsample obtained. Modern glucometers are able to analyze relatively small amounts of\nblood (minimum of 0.3\u00b5L).\nThe test strips for glucometers vary and the latest ones available are designed to allow\neasier blood application. Some have a confirmation window that will provide\nassurance to the patient that a sufficient amount of blood has been provided [9].\nGlucometers provide the blood glucose results in specified units: either mg\/dL (which\nis the standard for USA) or mmol\/L (which is the standard in UK, Canada and some\nEuropean countries). Some glucometers have the capacity to store the results and\nsome also have averaging features to aid users in gaining an overview of their blood\nglucose levels over periods of time.\n1.4 Aim\nThe aim of this review was to ascertain the state-of-the-art in informatics for\nglucometers. The level of informatics available on the device was analysed and the\nquantity and types of information provided to users were investigated. The review\ndescribes the methodology used, gives the results obtained from that methodology,\ndiscusses the findings and compares them against the state-of-the-art in informatics.\n2 Methodology\nA key word search was carried out to identify different types of commercially\navailable glucometers. An on-line resource, for example [10], and the British National\nFormulary (BNF) were of particular assistance.\nGlucometer manufacturers\u2019 websites were investigated to obtain the details of the\nglucometers they supplied. In total, information on 100 glucometers, available\nbetween the years 1998 and 2008, was obtained. This represented 27 manufacturers.\nThe list of glucometers assembled for this review was not exhaustive; however it\nincluded popular brands available, for example, Abbott, Bayer, LifeScan and Roche\nDiagnostics.\nThe operating manuals of 72% of glucometers were available online or after request\nfrom manufacturers. There were no manuals for 28% of devices by 14\nmanufacturers\/distributors thus resulting in incomplete information. However, a short\ndescription was normally provided by the manufacturer for those glucometers that did\nnot have online manuals. The manuals contained detailed instructions on how to\noperate the glucometer as well as its features and specification.\nThe manuals were analysed to obtain glucometer specifications and operating details.\nA categorization scheme was drawn up to investigate whether glucometers possessed\nparticular informatics features. Where glucometers were supplemented with \u201coff-\ndevice\u201d data management software, the capabilities of the software were analysed.\nThe results obtained are presented below in five groups: information before testing,\ntesting, on-device data manipulation after testing, off-device data-management\nsoftware capabilities and \u201cadvice\u201d given by the glucometer.\n3 Results\n3.1 Information before testing\n67% of devices reviewed required coding and 27% did not. Information about coding\ncould not be obtained for 6% of devices.\n19% of devices had the option of setting reminders for the patient to test, therefore\nshowing many manufacturers have not considered this as an essential feature to\nincorporate.\n62% of devices displayed an error message indicating that the glucometer was not\noperating in the right temperature range. In addition, 37% of devices also displayed a\nthermometer symbol on their screen to indicate that it was not operating in the right\ntemperature range.\n3.2 Testing\nThe time taken to generate results on devices was compared and the range was\nbetween 3-50 seconds. Some devices provided a time range for the time taken to\nobtain the result and for the purpose of data analysis this was adjusted to the\nmaximum time given. The shortest time taken to obtain test results was 3 seconds and\nthat was seen in 1 device \u2013 \u201cEvolution\u201d (Infopia). The majority of the devices (3 0%)\ngenerated their result in 5 seconds, followed by 20% of devices generating their result\nin 10 seconds and 15% of devices generating results in 7 seconds (see Figure 1). The\nmaximum time recorded was 50 seconds on \u201cPrestige IQ\u201d (Home diagnostics).\nGraph showing the duration of the test\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 26 30 40 45 50\nTime (seconds)\nNumber of\nglucometers\nFigure 1 - Duration of the test.\n3.3 On-device data manipulation after testing\n20% of devices allowed results to be flagged or marked with a symbol in order to\nassociate a particular event to the result.\n5% allowed users to add a comment to annotate the result. The glucometers provided\npredefined comments for users to select from. Table I shows examples of the\ncomments available. Normally, the comments were found in a single list. However,\nthe \u201cOneTouch UltraSmart\u201d (Life Scan) glucometer divided them into four categories\n\u2013 Food, Health, Exercise and Medication.\nTable 1 \u2013 A summary of comments provided on five glucometers to annotate the results.\nGlucometer Available Comments\nAccu-Chek Complete Before Meal, After Meal, Fasting, Snack, Feel\n(Roche Diagnostics) Hypo., Before Exercise, After Exercise, Illness,\nInvalid Test, Other\u2019s Result, User Defined,\nStress, L1 Control, L2 Control, Oral Medication\nOneTouch Profile Fasting, pre breakfast, after breakfast, pre noon\n(LifeScan) meal, after noon meal, pre dinner, after dinner,\ndifferent food, bedtime, during night, pre\nexercise, after exercise, illness, hypoglycemia,\nother\nOneTouch UltraLink No comment, Stress, Not enough food, Illness,\n(LifeScan); Too much food, Feel hypo, Mild exercise,\nOneTouch Ultra2 Menses (period), Hard exercise, Vacation,\n(LifeScan) Medication, Other\nOneTouch UltraSmart Food Comments \u2013 BefBrkft, Aft Brkft, Bef\n(LifeScan) Lunch, Aft Lunch, Bef Dinner, Aft Dinner and\nNight\nHealth Comments \u2013 Stress, Feel Hypo, Illness,\nMenses, Vacation, Other\nExercise Comments \u2013 Before, During, After\nMedication - None\n81% of devices calculated an average of the results recorded. Devices varied in the\nnumber of days over which an average could be calculated, and in how many\nvariations of averages were permitted. The maximum number of variations of the\naverage was 6 types i.e. 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 90-day averages. Figure 2 plots the\namount of glucometers against the number of types of average which they were able\nto display.\nGraph showing how many types of 'average' results a\nglucometer calculates\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nTypes\nNumber of\nglucometers\nFigure 2 - Types of averages calculated on glucometers.\nThe majority of devices (21%) calculated three types of averages, with 15% that\ncalculated 7, 14 and 30-day averages, 2% that calculated 7, 14 and 28-day averages\nand 3% that calculated 14, 30, 90-day averages. One device, \u201cEclipse\u201d (Infopia)\nallowed the patient to set 3 unique averages. 20% calculated six types of averages and\n19% calculate 1 type of average. Glucometers calculating six types of averages were\nlimited to four manufacturers: CardioCom, Diabetic Supply of Suncoast Inc.,\nDiagnostic Devices Inc. and TaiDoc.\n79% of devices allowed results to be downloaded to a computer, thus showing that a\nmajority of manufacturers have considered this as a feature to include. 11% did not\nallow results to be downloaded. Manufacturer\u2019s information for downloading could\nnot be obtained for 10% of glucometers.\n3.4 Off-Device data-management software\n51% of glucometers were found to be available with data management software,\nwhich extended data analysis \u201coff device\u201d.\nOf these software packages, 90% required data to be transferred via a USB cable;\n10% used infra-red connection.\n80% highlighted outliers in the blood glucose concentration either within a \u201clogbook\u201d\nor in graphs generated.\n90% allowed the generation of reports, the numbers of types of reports ranging from 5\nto 12. 40% allowed reports to be emailed, however printing or faxing of results were\noffered as an alternative.\n60% allowed the importing of extra data in addition to the data downloaded from\nglucometers. 30% did not have import facilities. Manufacturer\u2019s information could\nnot be obtained for the remaining 10%. 70% allowed exporting of data to another\napplication whereas 20% did not have export facilities. Manufacturer\u2019s information\ncould not be obtained for the remaining 10%.\nAll the software packages reviewed the calculated averages. 70% had further\nstatistical analysis capabilities such as standard deviation, minimum and maximum.\n3.5 On-device and off-device \u201cadvice\u201d\n77% of devices displayed a comment for example \u201chi\u201d or \u201clo\u201d whenever the blood\nglucose result was not within the specified measuring range of the device. All\nmanuals included definitions of these comments. The measuring range of 53% of the\nglucometers was between 20 and 600 mg\/dL (or 1.1 - 33.3 mmol\/L). For 23%,\nmanufacturer\u2019s information could not be obtained. Within these 77 devices, 73%\nspecified in the manual that users needed to repeat their test to confirm the results,\nwhenever these warning comments were displayed.\nCertain glucometers also provided warnings for actual, measured values of blood\nglucose that were particularly high or low. When a user\u2019s blood glucose was lower\nthan a specific range, \u201cOneTouch Profile\u201d (Life Scan) and \u201cOneTouch UltraSmart\u201d\n(LifeScan) glucometers displayed a message: \u201cDo you need a snack\u201d?\n\u201cDanger\u201d or \u201cCall Dr\u201d was displayed on \u201cOneTouch Profile\u201d (LifeScan) when a\nuser\u2019s blood glucose was higher than the specified range. The other glucometers\ndisplayed a message related to checking ketones in the blood.\n\u201cAccu-Chek Complete\u201d (Roche Diagnostics) displayed a message while the user was\ncarrying out a test, known as the tip of the day, which sometimes provided a reminder\nor supplied information to the user about managing their diabetes.\n21% of glucometers displayed messages providing advice on further action to take\nbased on their blood glucose result. For example, a message to check for ketones was\ndisplayed. 52% did not provide further comments. Manufacturer\u2019s information could\nnot be obtained for the remaining 27%.\n\u201cGlucoTel\u201d (BodyTel Scientific Inc), (not yet commercially available) was specified\nto incorporate human interaction in terms of the provision of advice. Once results are\ntransmitted and stored in the user\u2019s electronic patient health record held on an external\ndatabase, health professionals could set the option of being alerted (via email, text\nmessage or fax) should the user\u2019s blood glucose result be extreme. They could then\nprovide the most appropriate advice to the user.\n74% of glucometers were found to provide information explaining the messages that\nwere displayed on the glucometers. These included error messages. This information\nwas always placed in the manual. Manufacturer\u2019s information could not be obtained\nfor the remaining 26%. 25% of glucometers surveyed had manuals that provided\nmultiple reasons for individual error messages, leaving some interpretation of the\nmessage to the user. For error messages, the glucometers provided advice to the user\nregarding the actions to take and in some cases users were advised to redo their test.\nError messages shown on the glucometers included issues relating to the testing\nprocess. For example, faulty test strips, the size of the blood sample provided and the\ntemperature at which the test was carried out. Other error messages were related to\ngeneral problems with the glucometer which would make it unusable. Certain general\nmessages were provided in a pictorial form e.g. a battery symbol represented low\nbattery on the glucometer and a thermometer symbol indicated that the environmental\ntemperature for the glucometer was not in the right range.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Information provided to users\nCoding or calibration of a meter prior to testing is an extra step in blood glucose\ntesting and glucometers that are automatically coded reduce the error that may occur\nin blood glucose results. 67% of the glucometers reviewed required a coding step.\nNewer glucometer models have been developed with automatic coding features.\nHowever neither set-up provided the user with an estimate of the calibration error.\nAs testing of glucometers indicates that glucometer inaccuracy is so high that they\ncannot yet be used as a diagnostic test, this lack of error estimation is a serious\nlimitation on their informatics capabilities [11].\n\u201cProdigy Eject\u201d (Diagnostic Devices Inc) and \u201cAssure Pro\u201d (ARKRAY) reminded\nusers to carry out a control test which enabled patients to check that the glucometer\nand strips were functioning correctly. This was a necessary step that needed to be\ncarried out occasionally to ensure that the results obtained from the glucometer were\naccurate and the patient was not misinformed, which may lead to incorrect medication\nbeing administered leading to side effects. Control tests were also suggested from the\nmanual when unexpected results were obtained from the glucometer.\nThe proportion of glucometers reviewed providing an alarm function was 19%. This\nis particularly important as patient non-compliance with monitoring regimes is an\nimportant barrier in the move from acute to primary care. In particular, users with\nbusy or unpredictable lifestyles, reduced memory function or those yet to establish a\nmonitoring routine would benefit from improved alarm functions.\nMany of the reviewed glucometers incorporated a feature such that the measurement\nprocess started automatically once a sufficient blood sample had been provided,\notherwise an error message was displayed by the glucometer.\nA general trend was seen in the provision of advice to users, through the manual, of\npossible post-test actions to take. 73% of glucometers instructed users to redo their\ntest when unexpected results were obtained. Retests were also suggested whenever\nthere were no factors that could be affiliated to the result obtained by user action, (see\nbelow) (for example, the glucometer may have produced a low result, but the user had\nrecently had a meal). 17% of glucometers displayed a message regarding checking for\nketones. 1 glucometer \u201cPrecision Xtra\u201d (Abbott) provided the facility to test for\nketones, allowing the user ability to immediately act on the advice.\n4.2 User interaction with the results\n20% of glucometers allowed results to be flagged on the device. The intention of the\nflags was to highlight particular results so that when data was reviewed, users would\nbe able to discuss with their health professional, possible contributory factors, such as\nfood intake or exercise. However, the flag systems generally consisted of one letter\nsymbols and so could not provide detailed descriptions of factors. 6 glucometers had\nadded to the utility of flags by allowing their association with meals i.e. a result could\nbe flagged as occurring before or after a meal. For these glucometers, flagged results\nwere also not included in the calculation of averages of results. This was a way of\nexcluding outliers and the bias they may have introduced into users\u2019 averages.\nHowever, this assumes that the correct course of action would be to exclude these\nflagged events when calculating a users\u2019 average data.\nAveraging of results was a simple and quick way of data manipulation, possessed by\n81% of glucometers. This was the most advanced form of data manipulation seen on\nmost glucometers, although \u201cOneTouch UltraSmart\u201d (LifeScan), \u201cWaveSense\nKeynote\u201d (Agamatrix), \u201cWaveSense Keynote Pro\u201d (Agamatrix), \u201cPresto\u201d\n(Agamatrix) and \u201cAccu-Chek Complete\u201d (Roche Diagnostics) provided on-device\nfunctionality to visualise mini graphs to observe trends in the results.\nPredefined comments by manufacturers could be added to results to annotate them.\nNotably, \u201cAccu-Chek Complete\u201d (Roche Diagnostics) provided software that allowed\ncomments to be modified. Incorporation of this approach into glucometers in general\nwould allow both users and health professionals to monitor and assess how the user\u2019s\nlifestyle was influencing their blood glucose and the advice that could be given to the\nuser on how to improve their health.\nIn order to improve functionality, 74% of manufacturers have developed off-device\nsoftware to manipulate results obtained from the glucometer. The off-device software\npossessed certain common features across manufacturers, such as graphing\nfunctionality to visualise trends and an electronic \u201clogbook\u201d.\nAll glucometers reviewed had a memory capacity. This functionality reduced the need\nfor users to otherwise manually log their blood-glucose data.\n4.3 Glucometers and Informatics\nSeveral informatics models exist which could be applied to glucometers. For example,\nGeorgiou (2002) [12], described a health informatics model comprising data,\ninformation and knowledge where data was at the lowest level of the hierarchy and\nhas limited meaning on its own. Information provided context for managing data,\nwhile knowledge provided guidance for the cause of action to take based on insight\nand experience. In terms of conformity with such a health informatics model, all\nglucometers evaluated displayed data. To provide information about the result, 81%\nof glucometers incorporated an average function that allowed possible trends in the\ndata to be identified, but this was not automatically displayed. Cases where\ninformation was provided automatically were when extreme results were displayed\n(e.g. Hi or Lo); and when tests were carried out in extreme conditions (i.e. a\ntemperature symbol was displayed).\nSome glucometers also possessed an aspect of knowledge although this was limited to\ncomments when an extreme result was obtained. To further improve the quality of\nknowledge provided, glucometers would need to be embedded with decision support\nwhich would incorporate results with known facts about diabetes thus aiding users in\nmanaging their health. For example, glucometers could include a rule-based decision\nframework as described by Manjanatha et al. (2007) [13]. Manjanatha noted that\ncurrent medical devices did not integrate user care information with device-generated\ndata, therefore advice could be provided by the device. Though the authors came to\nthese conclusions for devices offering continuous monitoring, which provided\ninformation based on changing conditions of users, the information in this paper\nindicates that this conclusion could be extended to stand-alone devices such as\nglucometers.\n5 Conclusion\nThe paper has described the results from an evaluation of commercial glucometers. It\nhas highlighted the main informatics features available. Many glucometers provide\ninformation through their manuals. However, limited data processing and real-time\ndecision support, was found. It is suggested that glucometers could better serve as\nprimary care devices by incorporating more decision support directly on the device.\n6 References\n[1] Meier, F.A. and Jones, B. A.
