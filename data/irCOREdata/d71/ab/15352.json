Subsistence is based on\nmodification of plants and their environments in order to in-\ncrease their productivity and utility to people. Production is\naimed at household provisioning rather than cash-cropping or\nexport. Horticulturalists also commonly engage in substantial\nfishing, hunting, or other extractive foraging activities, but the\nbulk of the diet comes from domesticated plant species culti-\nvated in garden plots.1 Unlike many foraging groups, however,\nhorticulturalist households are characterized as relatively self-\nsufficient. Access to more predictable and storable agricultural\nproduce attenuates interfamily resource sharing and increases\nsedentism and territoriality. For example, food-sharing net-\nworks are more restricted among Ache who live on permanent\nsettlement and grow crops on private plots than among those\nwho forage nomadically in the forest (Gurven, Hill, and Kaplan\n2002). Horticulturalists tend to live in aggregations that are\nlarger and more sedentary than those of foragers. Available\nevidence from precontact societies suggests that raids and in-\ntergroup aggression are fairly common among horticulturalists\nor at least as common as among foragers (Keeley 1996; Wran-\ngham, Wilson, and Muller 2006). Table 1 describes domestic\norganization, descent patterns, settlement patterns and village\nsize, property right, and wealth stratification among the 83\nhorticulturalist societies from Murdock and White\u2019s (1969)\nStandard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS).\nHorticultural production first appeared in Southwest Asia\nand the Middle East during the Neolithic 9,000\u201311,000 years\nago and in other geographical regions by 3,000\u20136,000 years ago\n(Bellwood 2005). Plant domestication and animal domestica-\ntion have been viewed as watershed processes in the develop-\nment of human cultures and civilizations. All civilizations have\nbeen based on cultivation of one or more of six plant species:\nwheat, barley, millet, rice, maize, and potatoes. Population pres-\nsure, climatic and environmental change, reduced densities of\nlarge animals, and cultural transmission have been cited as key\ningredients in the adoption of food production (Flannery 1973;\nRindos 1987). Variability in the timing and expression of ag-\nriculture has been related to local differences in these factors\n1. Because much of the protein and lipids in the diet often come from\nanimal and fish consumption, these groups have often been referred to\nas horticulturalists-foragers or forager-horticulturalists.\nand in the availability of domesticable species and trade net-\nworks (Diamond 1999; Harris 1977).\nHorticultural societies vary along ecological, social, and po-\nlitical dimensions, but commonalities can be identified (Bates\n2001). First, horticulturalist households tend to be relatively\nindependent and make their own decisions in regard to food\nproduction without centralized authority. Second, horticul-\nture provides relatively low yield per land area, and so sur-\npluses are unusual. Farming techniques found in many hor-\nticultural systems are slash-and-burn and polyculture.\nSlash-and-burn involves the clearing and burning of trees and\nbrush to reduce competition from wild plants and to add soil\nnutrients from the ashes. After several cycles, productivity\ndeclines as a result of low nitrate and potassium levels, and\nthe cleared areas are left fallow to return to brush or forest.\nPolyculture involves a mix of crops or varieties interspersed\nin the same field, including root crops, fruit trees, palms, and\ncereals (maize, millet, barley, or rice). The mix of crops en-\nsures ground cover for most of the year and helps prevent\nerosion. A reliance on tree crops is also common. As gardens\n\u201cage,\u201d the combination of trees and crops will vary. Relatively\nshort cropping periods and long fallows mean that new fields\nmay be created frequently. Third, horticulture relies on simple\ntools such as digging sticks, hoes, machetes, and axes rather\nthan plows, machines, or irrigation. Without irrigation, hor-\nticulturalists depend on the seasonal cycle of rainfall. Hor-\nticulture is best suited to humid, tropical conditions, where\nmore intensive techniques such as monocropping and clear-\ncutting, in combination with heavy rainfall, often lead to soil\nerosion and degradation and fungal infections of crops.\nWealth\nFor many horticulturalists, wealth is somatic: stored in human\nbodies and channeled into growth, reproduction, and im-\nmune function. Most horticultural populations do not prac-\ntice efficient birth control, and fertility tends to be relatively\nhigh, averaging more than five offspring per woman (Bentley,\nJasienska, and Goldberg 1993; Wood 1994). A wealthy hor-\nticulturalist is healthy, well fed, and fertile.\nEcological knowledge is important for efficient food pro-\nduction. While several studies emphasize the difficulty of\nhunting (Gurven, Kaplan, and Gutierrez 2006; Ohtsuka 1989;\nWalker et al. 2002), horticulture may also require substantial\nknowledge and skill to learn proper timing for burning, plot\nrotation, planting techniques, pest control, and soil manage-\nment (Conklin 1957). Although the bulk of the calories in\nhorticultural groups comes from carbohydrate staples, such\nas yams, plantains, and rice, much time is spent engaging in\nother activities that provide important nutrients as well as\nprestige, such as hunting and spear fishing (Hames 1989).\nAnimal domestication is not uncommon but is usually con-\nfined to small animals such as chickens, goats, pigs, and sheep.\nDespite the self-reliance of horticultural households, social\nnetworks through kinship or alliances are important to insure\nTable 1.

Indeed, many horticulturalists\nin the Amazon and New Guinea were involved in frequent\nraiding of their neighbors (Keeley 1996). Physical size and mus-\ncular strength are associated with others\u2019 perceptions of dom-\ninance. Prestige and leadership are based largely on behavioral\nattributes, such as intelligence, charisma, and oratory skill, and\nare achieved and maintained through social support (Henrich\nand Gil-White 2001; von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan 2008).\nNumerous studies examine status differentials among hor-\nticulturalists (mostly men) and link these to favorable cultural\noutcomes. Owners of more land and with resident parents\nshow higher reproductive success (RS) in the Caribbean\n(Flinn 1986; Quinlan and Hagen 2008). High-status Ifalukese\nmen marry at younger ages, and their wives have higher fer-\ntility because of smaller interbirth intervals (Turke and Betzig\n1985). Yanomamo\u00a8 with unokai status for killing other men\nhave more wives and more surviving children (Chagnon\n1988). Better Tsimane and Piro hunters show greater fertility\nand RS (Gurven and von Rueden 2006). Healthier and taller\nadults also show higher fitness among rural Kavango in Na-\nmibia (Kirchengast and Winkler 1995, 1996) and rural Gam-\nbians (Sear 2006; Sear, Allal, and Mace 2004). Polygyny is\nfairly common among horticulturalist societies, where men\ncompete to obtain multiple wives.\nAs among foragers, material wealth is limited among most\nhorticulturalists. Food is often used as a currency for ex-\nchange, recruitment, and signaling, beyond immediate con-\nsumption. Other rare and valued materials may signal wealth,\nsuch as shells, carved stone, ivory, bone, ceramics, tools, and\ndecorative objects. In resource- or land-limited regions, how-\never, access to land, water, fish, or game may be restricted,\nand so access to territories and farming land may be controlled\nand transmitted through lineages.\nFew studies have measured variability in wealth holdings\namong horticulturalists. An analysis of rice holdings, cash\nincome, and household assets among 511 households from\n59 Tsimane villages revealed Gini coefficients ranging from\n0.28 for household wealth to 0.54 for cash income (Godoy\net al. 2004). Interestingly, there was little increase or decrease\nin inequality among villages that varied by level of accultur-\nation. In two villages, Gini coefficients of 0.31 and 0.38 were\ncalculated for number of close kin, a form of relational wealth\n(von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan 2008).\nEquality and Inequality\nSexual Division of Labor\nSexual divisions of labor are present in horticultural societies.\nMen\u2019s activities sometimes receive higher public recognition\nthan do women\u2019s, although men\u2019s work and women\u2019s work\nhave also been viewed as \u201cseparate but equal\u201d spheres (Collier\n1988; Sanday 1981). There may be less division of labor\namong horticulturalists than among foragers because both\nmen and women contribute to horticulture. Some notable\nexceptions to sexual egalitarianism exist, from common men-\nstrual taboos to punishment of female disobedience by group\nrape among the Mundurucu (Murphy and Murphy 1974).\nSome societies that engage in frequent warfare (e.g., Gebusi,\nMehinaku) have men\u2019s houses, where socialization of boys\noccurs separately from that of girls (Knauft 1985).\nStatus Differentiation\nNot all horticulturalists fit the same traditional labels popular-\nized by Service (1962; e.g., band, tribe, or chiefdom) or those\npopularized by Fried (1967; egalitarian, ranked, and stratified\nsocieties). Many horticultural groups are fairly egalitarian and\nautonomous but show more status differentiation than foragers.\nVillage leaders or headmen are often older charismatic adult\nmen with many kin ties and allies (Arhem 1981; Kracke 1978;\nMaybury-Lewis 1974; Mindlin 1985; von Rueden, Gurven, and\nKaplan 2008); they often carry no real authority or power to\nreward and punish but instead may coordinate activities, host\nevents, and negotiate relationships with outsiders. Horticul-\nturalists characterized by high mobility, little storage, small\ngroup size, and interdependence are more likely to be egali-\ntarian, similar to foraging groups, whereas horticulturalists that\ndiffer along these dimensions tend to display greater levels of\ninequality, as found among complex hunter-gatherers (Testart\n1982). Property ownership and territoriality are more culturally\nexplicit among horticulturalists than among many foragers,\nwhile leveling mechanisms designed to maintain egalitarianism\n(Wiessner 1996) are less evident but not absent. Accusations\nof witchcraft or sorcery among aggrandizers are common in\nhorticulturalist societies (Hill and Gurven 2004; Paciotti and\nHadley 2003). Extensive wealth accumulation and self-aggran-\ndizing are atypical among egalitarian horticulturalists. Craft and\nritual specialists, politicians, and formal leaders are not un-\ncommon (Chagnon 1968; Johnson and Earle 1987). In the past,\nwhen skirmishes over arable land were likely less of a problem\nthan today, competition may have been greater over labor to\nwork fields and generate surplus. The need for labor sometimes\nwas reflected in a formal or legal possession of slaves (Koptyoff\nand Miers 1977). Slavery is rare among ethnographically present\nsocieties, although several horticulturalist populations tradi-\ntionally had slaves (Colson 1960; Stearman 1988); 21 out of\nthe 83 horticulturalist societies from the SCCS show former\npresence of slavery.\nIn contrast to Amazonians and several African farmers, island\nhorticulturalists such as those in Oceania show greater status\nand wealth differentiation. Big-men and great-men leaders typ-\nical of these societies possess greater political influence, larger\ngardens, and more material wealth than do other group mem-\nbers (Turke and Betzig 1985). These societies are found where\nresources are densely concentrated, predictable, and defendable\nGurven et al. Intergenerational Wealth Transmission among Horticulturalists 53\nand where surpluses are created. Surpluses are generated by\nlabor recruitment efforts, competitive feasting, and redistri-\nbution of prestige items such as shell bands and domesticated\npigs (Hayden 1996). Classic ethnographies of Trobriand Is-\nlanders (Malinowski 1922; Weiner 1976), Samoans (Gilson\n1970), and Enga (Wiessner 2002) describe big men, the priv-\nileges that accrue to chiefly lineages, and competitive yam ex-\nchanges and feasts. For example, residential and yam houses\nbelonging to Trobriander chiefs are larger and more ornately\ndecorated than commoner houses. Chiefly status permits the\nright to have multiple wives, engage in kula exchanges, and\navoid certain food prohibitions (Weiner 1988).\nOther groups show a mixed egalitarian and ranked strat-\nification social structure, such as the Dani of Western Papua,\nwhere leaders accumulate wealth and prestige but inequality\ndoes not carry over to land ownership and farming. Instead,\nDani big men largely help organize rituals and war parties\n(Heider 1990). Evidence for highly complex horticulturalist\nsocieties is scant (but see Erickson 2000). Several kingdoms\nin Africa were highly structured and prestige based, such as\nthe Asante of southern Ghana, a conquest state with kings\nand chiefs who had lavish courts maintained by the trading\nwith Europeans of gold, kola nuts, and slaves (Fortes 1969).\nBut even among the Asante, land was held by matrilineages\nfor group members to farm as needed.\nSedentism, resource concentration and predictability, sur-\nplus production and storage, and higher population density\nhave all been linked to greater inequality in subsistence pop-\nulations (Carneiro 1970; Hayden 1995; Testart 1982; Upham\n1990). An often-cited but incomplete idea is that agriculture\npermits a surplus sufficient to maintain nonproductive classes\nsuch as warriors, priests, and politicians (Childe 1954) and\ninequalities beyond those due to age, sex, and abilities. Surplus\nproduction, however, is likely an endogenous outcome of\nother inequality-generating factors, such as differential access\nto patchy, predictable, and accumulable resources. When ter-\nritorial resources are concentrated in dense, high-quality\npatches, they become \u201ceconomically defensible,\u201d leading to\nmonopolization by emergent elites (Boone 1992; Brown 1964;\nDyson-Hudson and Smith 1978). Storage and accumulation\nof material resources over time can lead to greater disparities\nin wealth than exist when resources are transient. Leaders or\n\u201cmanagers\u201d may arise to organize raiding parties, redistribute\nresources, or deal with localized resource stress (Flannery\n1972; Smith and Choi 2007). According to the \u201cagency\u201d ap-\nproach to inequality emergence (Wiessner 2002), upstarts or\n\u201caggrandizers\u201d strive for influence by controlling access to\nresources or by extracting labor from others through debt\ncycles or coercion (Arnold 1995; Boone 1992). Nonelites,\nhowever, are not necessarily deprived of resources. In a system\nof \u201cmanagerial mutualism,\u201d subordinates may also benefit\nwhen provided goods by elites who compete for prestige and\nsupporters (Boone 1992, 1998).\nIntergenerational Transmission\nKinship is the basis for navigating social life and the flow of\ngoods and services in horticultural societies. One-third of\nhorticultural societies in the SCCS show patrilineal inheri-\ntance, one-fourth show matrilineal inheritance, and one-\nfourth show bilateral inheritance (table 1). More egalitarian\nhorticulturalists tend to show bilateral descent, such as among\nthe Gainj (Johnson 1982). One-third of societies show no\nformal property rights or inheritance rules; among those that\ndo, the most common pattern is for property to be distributed\nrelatively equally among sons (table 1). Among more egali-\ntarian horticultural societies, there is very little wealth to in-\nherit, except perhaps land in more circumscribed areas and\noccasional wealth items. Personal items may be burned or\nburied with the deceased, while large or expensive items, such\nas canoes, knives, and shotguns, are usually divided among\nsurviving family members (Murphy and Murphy 1974). In-\nheritance of these items may be sex biased (Crocker 1990),\nalthough women\u2019s items may also pass to daughters-in-law\ninstead of daughters (Bohannan and Bohannan 1953). Land\nprivileges are often granted through usufruct. As long as crops\nare growing in a field, permission must often be asked before\nothers may use the field (Bergman 1980). In the nonegali-\ntarian Polynesian horticultural societies, property and land\nrights are often organized strictly along descent group lines.\nWhen land is continuously rotated with long fallow periods,\nindividual private ownership and land inheritance may not\nbe sensible. Instead, descent groups often own communal\nland, and distribution of access rights to member households\nis coordinated by lineage heads (Bohannan and Bohannan\n1953; Holmes 1974).\nEthnographies report that sons and sometimes daughters\nbenefit from the social position of parents, particularly fathers\n(Heider 1990). Leadership positions, however, are not usually\nstrictly heritable but remain in part dependent on individual\nskills and personality (Wiessner 2002). Positions, however,\nmay be held by other family members. It is important to\nacknowledge that traditional structures of horticulturalist so-\ncieties with a history of chiefly lineages and kingdoms, such\nas the Asanti, Ganda, and Shambala, are no longer intact. It\nis possible that remaining horticulturalist societies, especially\nthose represented here, show less inheritance of individual-\nlevel privilege and rights. However, even among the African\nkingdoms mentioned above and the Classic Maya (Edmonson\n1979), land was not held privately and most inhabitants were\ncommoners with communal access to farm land through their\nlineages.\nSample and Methods\nOverview\nWe present data from four horticultural populations: rural\nDominicans, Mandinka, Pimbwe, and Tsimane. Dominicans\nare rural peasants of Dominica in the Caribbean. The Man-\n54 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 1, February 2010\ndinka and Pimbwe are dry-land farmers from the Gambia\nand Tanzania, respectively, and the Tsimane are Amazonian\nrain forest horticulturalist-foragers from Bolivia. Our reliance\non only four groups means that our sample cannot be rep-\nresentative of horticulturalists either today or from the past.\nThe majority of the societies from the SCCS in table 1 come\nfrom the insular Pacific (29%), Africa (18%), and South\nAmerica (28%). Today, many horticultural groups occupy\nmarginalized areas in the humid tropics and arid regions\nwhere prospects for intensive agriculture are poor. Availability\nof wealth data varies among our sample populations, as do\nthe levels of market integration and other indicators of ac-\nculturation during the study periods. The largest number of\nwealth measures exists for Pimbwe and Tsimane, and so we\ndevote more attention to these societies.\nRural Dominicans\nEthnographic background. Bwa Mawego, one of the least de-\nveloped villages on the windward side of Dominica, contains\nabout 700 full- and part-time residents of mixed African,\nEuropean, and island-Carib descent (Quinlan 2005). Eco-\nnomic activities include subsistence taro-based horticulture,\nfishing, bay leaf oil production, banana production, shop-\nkeeping, and limited wage labor. Average annual household\nincome in Bwa Mawego is currently about EC$5,000\n(US$1,850). Opportunities for education are limited. About\n30% of villagers born between 1955 and 1986 have attended\n\u201chigh school\u201d equivalent to ninth and tenth grade in the\nUnited States; older adults have less education. The popu-\nlation is relatively healthy for the Caribbean region. Kinship\nand family are the foundation of economic, social, and re-\nproductive behavior, with almost everyone in the village re-\nlated by blood or marriage. Many households consist of sev-\neral women and their children; conjugal, single-mother, and\nother alternative styles are also common (Quinlan and Flinn\n2005). Several households of closely related kin often live\ntogether in a family compound. There are several large pa-\ntrilineages and many small lineages; matrilineages are not rec-\nognized. Patrilineal descent provides individuals with access\nto ancestral family lands through usufruct, which can be ad-\nvantageous to individuals whose immediate family does not\nown land.\nWealth measures. Land is the basis of economic production\nin Bwa Mawego. Bwa den (bay leaf Pimenta racemosa L.) is\nthe primary source of cash. Villagers extract bay oil from bwa\nden and then sell it to a cooperative that in turn sells the oil\nto global distributors as an ingredient in soap and perfume.\nMost villagers either own or work bwa den for income. Bwa\nden field sizes (in acres) owned by living and recently dead\nresidents of the village who were aged 25\u0001 in 2005 were\nestimated on the basis of interviews with two groups of locals\n(Quinlan and Hagen 2008). Interrater reliability across the\ntwo groups was moderate (Cronbach\u2019s ), and reli-ap .68\nability tests based on kinship and sex suggest little bias in\nfield size estimation. Although women can and do own bwa\nden, interrater reliability scores suggest that women\u2019s claims\nto land are somewhat ambiguous.\nMandinka\nEthnographic background. Four villages in the West Kiang dis-\ntrict of the Gambia were first studied by physician Ian\nMcGregor in 1950, chosen because of their remote location\nand poor health profile (McGregor 1991). The residents are\nmostly Mandinka, though the samples also include a minority\nof Jola, former slaves of Mandinka. During the study period,\nall villages practiced horticulture, with rice as the main sub-\nsistence crop by the end of the study period. Additionally,\ngroundnuts were grown as a cash crop. Rights to land use\nreside largely with men, and these rights are inherited patri-\nlineally; however, women do the bulk of the subsistence farm-\ning and may occasionally own their own rice fields and pass\nthem to their daughters. Residence patterns are patrilocal, but\nmobility is low so that most women marry within their natal\nvillage. Transport links to other regions of the Gambia were\nrelatively poor during McGregor\u2019s observation period, though\nthey have improved considerably over the past few decades.\nFew individuals were educated until the late 1970s, when a\nprimary school was established in Keneba. Before the primary\nschool, only a few boys would have been sent away to receive\nan Islamic education. In 1975, the Dunn Nutrition Unit\n(DNU) set up a permanent research station and medical clinic\nin Keneba, the largest village. The clinic had an immediate\neffect on child mortality rates, while morbidity was less af-\nfected (Rayco-Solon et al. 2004). Fertility, however, has only\nrecently started to decline, despite the availability of contra-\nception at the clinic. Before 1975, both fertility and mortality\nwere high: women averaged seven children, and more than\n40% died by age 5 (Billewicz and McGregor 1981). Polygyny\nwas high, with most men acquiring more than one wife by\nthe time they reached late middle age. Men married much\nlater than women (mean age at first birth was 18 for women\nbut 31 for men) and therefore reproduced until much older\nages.\nWealth measures. Given the exclusive focus of McGregor and\nthe DNU on health and mortality, data exist for only two\nforms of embodied wealth: anthropometric status and fertil-\nity\/RS. We use data only from individuals who were alive and\nreproduced in the pre-DNU period because of the substantial\ninfluence of the DNU clinic. Anthropometric data were col-\nlected between 1950 and 1980. Only individuals who reached\nthe age of 18 years were included in the analysis; average\nweights were calculated for each person on the basis of re-\npeated measurements. RS data are based on births occurring\nbefore 1975 and calculated for only those individuals who\nreached the age of 15 years before 1975. Age controls were\nincluded for individuals to account for those who died or\nGurven et al. Intergenerational Wealth Transmission among Horticulturalists 55\nwere censored before the end of their reproductive period, as\nwas a control for birth cohort. RS was defined as the number\nof children surviving to age 5, and children censored before\nthe age of 5 were discounted according to their age-specific\nprobability of surviving to 5 years. Fertility and mortality data\nwere available from the demographic surveillance system,\nwhich has recorded all births and deaths since 1950, supple-\nmented by birth histories collected from those who began\nreproducing before 1950. Only two of the four villages were\nincluded in the RS analysis because demographic data were\nthought to be underreported in the other two villages in the\nearly years of the study.\nPimbwe\nEthnographic background. The Pimbwe of the Rukwa Valley\n(Tanzania) are mostly subsistence farmers who also seasonally\nhunt, fish, and collect honey (Borgerhoff Mulder 2009). Until\nTanzanian independence (1963), the Pimbwe were subject to\ninternecine war and a chiefly system. Chiefly and other high-\nranking positions were transmitted to a sister\u2019s son, although\ninheritance sparked bitter disputes (Willis 1966). Below the\nchiefly levels, Pimbwe society is eminently egalitarian, with a\nvirulent system of witchcraft accusations and counteraccu-\nsations serving to dissuade anyone from rising above the\ncrowd (Paciotti and Hadley 2003) and with social order now\nmaintained at least in part by a local vigilante organization\n(Paciotti and Borgerhoff Mulder 2004) and in part by the\norgans of a modernizing state.\nPimbwe have no electricity and limited access to clean wa-\nter, all-weather roads, and (since 2006) mobile phones (Pa-\nciotti et al. 2005). Primary schooling has been available in\nalmost all villages since the early 1970s, although schools are\nnot well maintained or funded. The Pimwbe have little ac-\ncumulated wealth. Less than 10% of the population own\nsmallstock (goats), which are generally used as cash savings\nand sold only in times of need; the same is true for the more\ncommonly raised poultry. Families have rights to land through\ncultivation, but land is largely freely available. Production is\nlimited by the availability of family labor and the health of\nadult household members. Family illness is cited by Pimbwe\nas one of the primary reasons for deficits in food production.\nOne source of cash among the Pimbwe is the sale of maize\nand other cash crops such as sunflower, rice, and peanuts.\nAverage earnings from cash crops are very low and show high\ninterannual variation due to vagaries of weather and crop\ndamage by wildlife and pests. Some men earn income from\na seasonal craft or trade, such as fishing, hunting, honey pro-\nduction, carpentry, dispensing traditional medicine, providing\nwitch doctor services, trading old clothes, and manual labor.\nThe primary source of women\u2019s additional income is brewing\nand distilling of maize, products sold either privately or in\none of the village bars.\nWealth measures. Analyses based on six surveys from 1995 to\n2006 are focused on the villagers of Mirumba. The sample\nincludes all individuals aged 15\u0001 ever interviewed. Given the\nlack of privately owned material wealth such as land, the\nvagaries of livestock raising, and the near-complete erosion\nof the traditional chiefly statuses, wealth in Mpimbwe is best\nthought of as deriving from health, strength, fertility, and\ncontrol of (children\u2019s) labor. Intergenerational transmission\nis therefore investigated for weight, RS, household wealth, and\nfarming skill. RS is defined as the number of offspring sur-\nviving to age 5 among women aged 45\u0001 and men aged 55\u0001.\nChildren who had not yet reached 5 years of age were weighted\naccording to their probability of surviving this period (.82).\nHousehold wealth is measured as the currency value of the\nsum total of household items, including the materials of the\nhouse itself. Farming skill is measured as the number of\nmonths a house was with maize in its granary. Land is freely\navailable and not strictly heritable, and so a household\u2019s suc-\ncess in providing food throughout the year is due not to\ndifferential land ownership (although cultivated land was con-\ntrolled for in the measure) but rather to skills in farming,\nstorage, and resource management; dependency ratios are\nclosely correlated with land under cultivation. Maize pro-\nduction and annual availability are subject to stochastic\nshocks, such as inclement weather, changing river courses,\nelephants, insect pests, and theft. Although not all of these\nshocks can be directly countered, skill, foresight, knowledge,\nwise planning, hard work, and good social relations with\nneighbors and kin can help reduce the risks of spending many\nmonths without food in the granary.\nTsimane\nEthnographic background. Tsimane are a subsistence-based so-\nciety of more than 8,000 forager-horticulturalists living in\nmore than 50 villages with fairly minimal external market\ninteractions. Horticultural fields containing a mixture of plan-\ntains, rice, corn, and sweet manioc are fairly small (!1 ha)\nand are left to fallow after several years of use, with new fields\ncreated based on availability and ownership based on usufruct.\nIn more acculturated villages, fields are often larger because\nrice is also sold as a cash crop. Fishing is common in all\nTsimane villages located near water rivers, oxbow lakes, or\nlagoons. Hunting with shotguns, rifles, and bow and arrow\nis common in interfluvial villages. Mobility was more com-\nmon a generation ago, and with high fertility (total fertility\n), extended families are often spread across numerousratep 9\ncommunities. Villages are composed of clusters of related\nhouseholds who often pool resources and labor.\nTraditionally, there were no official leaders; older men and\nshamans wielded community-wide influence (Daillant 1994;\nvon Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan 2008). Very few shamans\nremain today. In recent decades, Tsimane villages have\nadopted a system of elected chiefs (corregidores) and other\nofficials in larger villages for representation purposes and in-\nteraction with outside interests. Chiefs wield no real power;\n56 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 1, February 2010\ntheir main tasks are to hold and conduct meetings in the\nevent of conflicts, help organize community labor events, and\nrepresent village interests in transactions with outsiders. They\nare usually young or middle-aged men fluent in Spanish and\nwith some experience dealing with Bolivian nationals. In vil-\nlages where loggers make deals with Tsimane, chiefs and their\nfamilies benefit more than other families. There is little ac-\ncumulated wealth among Tsimane, and no consistent, robust\nassociations between market access and wealth inequality have\nbeen demonstrated (Godoy et al. 2004). Items of value include\nshotguns and rifles used for hunting, axes, radios, watches,\nbicycles, and dugout canoes. Income is earned through spo-\nradic wage labor opportunities with loggers, merchants, and\nranchers, while a small number of mostly men have been\ntrained as bilingual elementary education teachers. Another\nsource of wealth includes domesticated animals such as chick-\nens, ducks, and, in some rare cases, pigs and cows. Chickens\nare often raised for consumption and sometimes for trade.\nPigs and cows are used for barter and also for consumption\nduring festivals. After death, a person\u2019s belongings are usually\nburned or buried with the person, although expensive durable\nitems such as shotguns are passed down to a relative (usually\na son).\nWealth measures. Data exist for eight types of wealth covering\nthe somatic-knowledge, material, and social domains that\ncomprise key components of Tsimane production and cultural\nsuccess. These include RS, body size, cultural knowledge,\nhunting success, household wealth, field labor networks, and\nalliances. Measures are constructed from data collected from\nongoing fieldwork as part of the Tsimane Health and Life\nHistory Project (2002\u20132008). RS includes number of children\nsurviving to age 5 among women age 40\u0001 and men age 45\u0001,\nwith right-censored cases discounted by the average proba-\nbility of surviving to age 5. Body size is measured as body\nweight wearing light clothing taken during medical visits using\na portable weigh scale. Cultural knowledge is measured from\nself-reported possession of a large number of sex-specific cul-\ntural skills covering economic production, tool and craft man-\nufacture, song and story repertoire, and sociality. Each per-\nson\u2019s score is the proportion of sex-specific skills held (total\n53 for women, 67 for men). Hunting success, measured by\nthe average number of calories gained per hour spent hunting,\nis based on a combination of focal follows and interviews of\nhunters and is reported in Smith et al. (2010, this issue).\nHousehold wealth describes the sum monetary value (based\non the buying price in the nearest town) of shotguns, rifles,\nwatches, radios, bicycles, and domesticated animals among\nall nuclear family members.\nCooperative labor partnerships are measured as the number\nof helpers in horticultural tasks during the previous year,\nbased on interviews in 11 remote villages. Larger communities\nthat engage in more cash-cropping (mostly rice) were ex-\ncluded from the sample. People paid in money, goods, or\nfarm product for their labor were not included in the tally.\nOnly father-son dyads were considered here. Alliances were\nmeasured according to a ranking procedure where local raters\nranked sets of eight photos of their peers on the basis of who\nwould have more allies help them in the event of a conflict\n(von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan 2008). A block design\ninsured that no two photos appeared together in the same\narray more than once. The range of possible scores was 8\u201364.\nMethodological Limitations\nTable 4 presents the sample size of parent (F1) and offspring\n(F2) dyads by wealth type for each of the four populations.\nSample sizes vary substantially and tend to be larger for more\neasily measured variables, ranging from 41 for hunting skill\namong Tsimane to 1,274 for weight among Mandinka.\nValues for several F2 wealth measures are paired with the\nmidpoint value of their biological parents. This does not mean\nthat children consistently coresided with both of their bio-\nlogical parents. Our choice for F1 and F2, however, is the best\nmetric for capturing intergenerational transmission in social\nsystems where children may live with one, the other, or both\nparents for at least the majority of their period of dependence,\nin which there are no strict rules of intergenerational trans-\nmission, and in which children learn primarily from the adults\nin their household.\nThe reliance on F1-F2 dyads requires information on two\ngenerations. For many individuals, death before study and\nresidence in a nonstudy village leave many unpaired individ-\nuals. These are probably the largest possible sources of bias.\nTrait values for complete F1 and F2 generations were compared\nwith those remaining after removing unpaired individuals.\nThe most common bias favors stable group members and\ndisfavors immigrants or highly mobile individuals; the re-\npeated panel design of the Mandinka, Pimbwe, and Tsimane\nstudies helps to reduce this bias.\nWhile the four populations lived fairly traditional lifestyles\nduring the data collection periods, each has had a history of\ninteraction with other populations, national society, and in-\ncreasing integration to the market. Traditional subsistence ac-\ntivities occur in the context of increasing formal education\nof the current generation, cash-cropping, and wage labor.\nNovel wealth types, such as competency in the national lan-\nguage or years of formal schooling, were not analyzed here\nbecause of the rapid pace of change. To some extent, we\nattempted to control for some of the effects of acculturation.\nAmong Tsimane, where economic activities can vary in dif-\nferent parts of their territory, we added a \u201cregion\u201d variable\nto regressions to help control for both environmental varia-\ntion and acculturation.

For comparability across the pro-\nduction systems and to reduce ambiguity, we combine somatic\nand knowledge wealth as embodied (e) wealth (Kaplan 1996).\nThe relative importance of different types of capital is de-\nscribed by the a\u2019s (alphas) from the Cobb-Douglas produc-\ntion equation , wherea a ae m rwp A# E M R \u0001 d a \u0001a \u0001e m\n(see Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009).2 Given the im-a p 1r\npressionistic nature of these judgments, we do not attempt\nto explain small differences in a but instead highlight several\ngeneral patterns. Consistent with the typological descriptions\nof wealth outlined in \u201cWealth,\u201d material wealth does not ap-\npear to be a substantial component of household well-being,\ncontributing an average of only one-fifth (0.21) of total wealth\nimportance. Material wealth was judged to be the least im-\nportant wealth type among all four populations. Embodied\nwealth accounts for a substantial one-half (0.53) of well-being.\nTwo-thirds of this is somatic capital, and the remaining third\nis knowledge. Finally, the a for relational social capital, con-\nstitutes, on average, one-fourth (0.26) of the total wealth input\nexponents. Table 2 reflects our impressions from \u201cWealth\u201d\nthat emphasized the importance of relational capital for cul-\ntural success, even (or especially) among egalitarian horti-\nculturalists, and the lower importance of material capital.\nOnly hunter-gatherers show a higher mean a for relational\ncapital and a lower a for material capital (see Smith et al.\n2010). Figure 1 illustrates the a\u2019s for all horticultural popu-\nlations in a ternary plot. Despite the geographic, ecological,\nand cultural variation in our sample, there was a fairly low\n2.

While strong, healthy bodies are critical for successful\nfood production and mate selection among Tsimane, their somatic wealth\na scored the lowest; overall well-being, especially during critical times of\nneed, may be affected more by variability in social networks than by\ndifferences in somatic or knowledge-based wealth.\n58 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 1, February 2010\nTable 3.

When weighted by the importance ofmp 0.52 rp 0.23\neach wealth type to population-specific wealth (based on the\na\u2019s), as well as by the inverse of their estimated variances (to\naccount for the differing degrees of precision of the various\nestimates), the mean Gini across wealth classes dropped to\n0.21. Material wealth consistently shows the highest levels of\ninequality, on par with income inequality in the United States\n(0.463 in 2007). We highlight some notable patterns by wealth\ntype. Material wealth has the highest average Gini (0.52), while\nbody weight has the lowest (0.08). Ginis for RS (0.24) and\nskill\/productivity (0.25) are intermediate. We hesitate to com-\npare inequality levels among societies, given the variable num-\nber of wealth categories for each population. Only among the\nTsimane do wealth data exist for all categories, resulting in\nan a-weighted Gini of 0.17.\nIntergenerational Wealth Elasticity (b)\nTable 4 summarizes the estimate, the standard error, and the\nstatistical significance of the transmission coefficient between\nparental wealth and offspring wealth (hereafter referred to as\nb) by wealth type and population, as determined from mul-\ntiple regression analyses described in the introductory paper\nin this special section (Bowles, Smith, and Borgerhoff Mulder\n2010, in this issue). Figure 2 illustrates several examples. Em-\nbodied wealth is based on 10 measures from three societies,\nmaterial wealth is based on three measures from three soci-\neties, and relational wealth is based on two measures from\nonly one society. The overall b for horticulturalists, weighted\nby the importance (a) of each wealth type in promoting\nhousehold well-being, is 0.18.\nEmbodied wealth. The mean b for embodied wealth for hor-\nticulturalists is 0.17 (table 4). Measures include body weight,\ngrip strength, RS, and hunting performance. Parent-offspring\nelasticities for body weight are the strongest of all b\u2019s, varying\nfrom 0.25 to 0.39. Given the relatively large b\u2019s for weight, it\nis surprising that the b for grip strength is very small. Grip\nstrength is correlated with weight, given Tsimane leanness\n(mean adult body mass index p 23). A similar high b for\nweight but low b for grip strength was also observed among\nthe Hadza (Smith et al. 2010).\nThe b\u2019s for RS were low, consistently !0.13.

Although it might be expected that increased competition\nwith more siblings might reduce sons\u2019 RS, larger kin groups,\nespecially of older sibs, might provide additional critical sup-\nport in finding mates. A variety of alternative caretakers may\nalso help improve child survivorship relatively cheaply be-\ncause of depreciating costs of babysitting and other care ac-\ntivities. Parents with greater RS may themselves come from\nlarger sibships, which will provide a larger set of available\ncross-cousins to marry in societies, such as Tsimane, where\nthe ideal mate is a cross-cousin.\nUnlike the case for Tsimane hunting (discussed in Smith\net al. 2010), there is no intergenerational transmission for\nPimbwe farming skill. Even though farming production was\naveraged across multiple years to reduce the effects of annual\nvariability, it is possible that stochastic factors in an unpre-\ndictable and pest-ridden environment overwhelm heritably\ntransmitted knowledge. The farming skill measure also com-\nbines knowledge with planning and work effort. Each of these\nmay be transmitted differently, and farming knowledge itself\nmight be widely available. Tsimane cultural knowledge shows\nlow intergenerational transmission, with . Manybp 0.11\ncommon skills are readily obtained by Tsimane during de-\nvelopment and early adulthood; individual abilities and ex-\nperience may swamp the effects of informal parent-offspring\nsocial transmission.\nMaterial wealth. The overall b for material wealth in this\nsample is 0.09 (table 4). Data exist only for household wealth\nand land. Household wealth showed no relationship. Among\nPimbwe and Tsimane, there is little household property trans-\nmitted directly between parent and offspring households, es-\npecially because most household items last for only a few\nyears. Houses themselves survive for only about a decade.\nAmong Pimbwe, a fierce ideology of self-reliance limits in-\nterhousehold sharing and kin support. When asked about\nsupport received by others for food, school fees, and medical\nbills, Pimbwe react with disgust, insisting on their indepen-\ndence. Fear of sharing and dependence stems from deep con-\ncerns with witchcraft that pervade all aspects of Pimbwe social\nlife. Help among households is somewhat low but more forth-\n60 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 1, February 2010\nFigure 2. Offspring (F2) and parental (F1) wealth, adjusted for age.

While complaints about the inad-\nequacy of help received from others are common, there is no\nsimilar ideology or concern about witchcraft. Tsimane ac-\ncusations of sorcery are usually directed toward outgroup\nmembers and, if anything, are more common when people\nrefuse to share.\nWe expected that transmission of material wealth to Do-\nminican sons would be more substantial because of loose\npatrilineal inheritance norms (Quinlan and Flinn 2005).\nHowever, we found little evidence of intergenerational in-\nheritance of land among Dominicans, with . Sonsbp 0.14\nare often viewed as risky investments, and relatives other than\nGurven et al. Intergenerational Wealth Transmission among Horticulturalists 61\nchildren usually contribute many years of agricultural labor\nto these plots. It is possible that these other relatives may\ninherit land through oblique transmission. Parents sell bay\nleaves and use the cash to finance children\u2019s education and\nmigration. Bay leaf farming is recognized as difficult work,\nso productive parents may use their profits to provide other\nopportunities for children, although parents\u2019 bwa den plot\nsize is not significantly associated with the probability of chil-\ndren\u2019s migration.\nRelational wealth. Our only measures of relational wealth are\nfor the Tsimane: number of helpers assisting in agricultural\nfield activities and number of male alliances during conflicts.\nFathers with more helpers were somewhat more likely to have\nsons with more helpers ( ). While this relationship isbp 0.18\nnot driven by the set of data points represented by parents\nand offspring with no helpers, it is weakened by excluding\neither shared individuals who help both F1 and F2 or help\nexchanged between F1 and F2.\nAllies are an important resource during interpersonal con-\nflicts with other Tsimane and with Bolivian colonists, mer-\nchants, or loggers. The number of named allies in the event\nof a conflict is highly correlated with several measures of social\nstatus and respect (von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan 2008).\nThe relationship between the number of parental and off-\nspring allies was stronger than that found among labor part-\nners ( ). This result was not driven by parents andbp 0.34\noffspring naming each other.\nDiscussion\nMaterial wealth was considered the least important contrib-\nutor of household well-being across the four horticultural\nsocieties in our study, while embodied and relational wealth\nwere considered the most important (table 2). On average,\nintergenerational transmission of material wealth was low,\neven though inequality was relatively high (table 3). Embodied\nand relational wealth are both important determinants of\nwell-being among horticulturalists. Physically robust and\nhealthy bodies are needed to produce and defend resources,\nacquire the repertoire of cultural skills, and attract mates and\nallies. Higher transmission coefficients were found for somatic\nwealth (except RS) than for knowledge or skill. Cultural\nknowledge and information may be easily obtainable from a\nwide variety of kin, peers, and others, and\/or individual ex-\nperience and abilities may trump the value of any specialized\ntraditions or knowledge passed from parents to children. So-\ncial networks are also important to horticulturalist household\nwell-being. The number and quality of kin and allies mediate\naccess to resources and mates and to support when conflicts\nerupt or when one is disabled. Although based on data from\nonly one population, the level of intergenerational transmis-\nsion for relational capital is nontrivial, with transmission co-\nefficients averaging 0.26. A similar level of wealth elasticity is\nfound for embodied capital (average p 0.17).\nDespite the implication that intergenerational wealth elas-\nticities are higher for the types of wealth that are more im-\nportant in each society, we found no significant correlation\nbetween our set of 15 a\u2019s and b\u2019s ( , ); thisrp 0.12 Pp .662\ncontrasts with the significant correlation reported for the\nlarger sample of hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastor-\nalists, and intensive farmers (Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009;\nSmith et al. 2010). However, the relationship for horticul-\nturalists improves after eliminating RS measures, which\nshowed consistently very low b\u2019s ( , ).rp 0.38 Pp .217\nThe nontrivial b\u2019s and measured inequality are remarkable,\ngiven the roughly egalitarian nature of these four horticultural\nsocieties. Overall wealth transmission (mean b weighted by\na) for horticulturalists is low (0.18), very close to that cal-\nculated for hunter-gatherers (0.19), and about half of that\nreported for pastoralists and intensive farmers (see Borgerhoff\nMulder et al. 2010, in this issue; Shenk et al. 2010, in this\nissue; Smith et al. 2010). The importance of such low b\u2019s,\nhowever, should not be underestimated: a b of 0.2 implies\nthat a child born into the top wealth decile of the population\nis 3.6 times more likely to remain in the top decile than is a\nchild whose parents were in the bottom decile (as discussed\nin Bowles, Smith, and Borgerhoff Mulder 2010). The wealth\nelasticities for each of the three wealth classes are also similar\namong horticulturalists and hunter-gatherers, as is the overall\na-weighted Gini index measuring wealth inequality (0.27 for\nhorticulturalists vs. 0.25 for hunter-gatherers).\nGiven the b\u2019s in table 4, we can say that the steady state\nlevels of variance in logarithm of wealth (a standard unit-free\nmeasure of inequality) range from (material21.004# jl\nwealth) to (relational wealth), where is a mea-2 21.034# j jl l\nsure of the variance in wealth shocks in one generation and\nthe coefficient multiplier is (see Borgerhoff Mulder2 \u00021(1\u0002 b )\net al. 2009). Thus, at equilibrium, there is greater inequality\nin the wealth measures that are of greater utility to horti-\nculturalists, that is, relational and embodied. Thus, not all\ntypes of wealth are equally distributed and inherited across\ngenerations. Another important conclusion here is that the\ndomestication of plants alone does not lead to greater in-\nequality. Limited access to storable or defendable resources\nsuch as land, technology, or animals is a necessary ingredient\nfor high levels of inequality to emerge. Such limitation is\nminimal in our sample but is common among intensive ag-\nriculturalists and pastoralists.\nAlthough our inferences here refer to intact horticultural\nsocieties, our four societies vary in their degree of accultur-\nation and market integration. Each has a history of contact,\nconquest, and, to some extent, marginalization. It remains to\nbe seen how integration into the market economy has and\nwill continue to impact inequality. Production functions may\ninclude a greater reliance on material wealth and new forms\nof human capital, such as formal schooling, proficiency in\nnational language, and local politics. Relational capital may\ninclude important contacts in distant locations for the pur-\npose of trade, cash-cropping, and wage labor opportunities.\n62 Current Anthropology Volume 51, Number 1, February 2010\nIt is likely that novel forms of wealth show greater inequality\nthan traditional forms expressed in this paper, and so overall\ninequality in extant horticultural societies may be more ex-\naggerated than the portrait given here.\nThe Kuznets hypothesis, proposed to explain differences in\ninequality among nations, suggests an inverted U-shaped re-\nlationship between economic development and inequality\n(Kuznets 1955). At low levels of development, most work in\nsubsistence agriculture and land rights is based on usufruct.\nWith increasing market integration, economic inequalities in-\ncrease as subgroups selectively opt to obtain formal education,\nsell produce, trade, and engage in wage labor or service oc-\ncupations. At high levels of development, few practice sub-\nsistence agriculture, and most, if not all, work for wages.\nPresumably, income inequality decreases at higher levels of\neconomic development, accentuated by social welfare pro-\ngrams that promote redistribution. The only empirical test of\nthe Kuznets hypothesis in a small-scale society was done\namong the Tsimane and did not lead to consistent, conclusive\nresults across wealth types or econometric specifications (Go-\ndoy et al. 2004). Greater inequality requires greater reliance\non limited, predictable, and monopolizable resources, partic-\nularly material wealth. Deliberate social norms that promote\neconomic redistribution will also dampen inequality. It is\nnoteworthy that the average Gini index of inequality from\nour four populations is similar to that of Scandinavian coun-\ntries that employ strong social welfare programs. Sharing\nnorms based on a risk-sharing foraging economy often re-\nmain, even if somewhat modified, following economic\nchange.\nAcknowledgments\nM. Gurven and H.
