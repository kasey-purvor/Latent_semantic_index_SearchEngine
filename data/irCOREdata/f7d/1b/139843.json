This concentration can be \nexpressed in either parts per million (ppm), % volume, or as a percentage of the lower explosive limit \n(LEL) of the gas mixture, the latter being an important safety parameter\n[1]\n. In traditional instruments, a \ndifferent sensor technology is typically employed for each range. Thermal conductivity sensors are \nused to measure %volume concentrations in these sensors. Pellistor sensors are used to detect gas \nconcentrations on the %LEL scale, and consist of a catalyst bead on which flammable gases are \noxidized at high temperature\n[2]. This exothermic reaction raises the bead temperature still further and \nincreases the bead\u2019s electrical resistance. High sensitivity flame ionization detectors (FIDs) are used \non the ppm range and burn the gas directly in a hydrogen flame\n[3]\n. Because of their operating \nprinciples, both pellistors and FIDs provide a measure of concentration that is inherently related to the \ncombustibility of the natural gas leak. \n \nNatural gas consists predominantly of methane, and there has been great interest in optical sensors, \nbased on measuring methane\u2019s infrared absorption, as a means of detecting and quantifying natural gas \nleaks. These developments have raised the issue of cross-sensitivity of instruments to the different \ncomponents of natural gas. Narrow-band tunable laser diodes are available in the near infrared \noffering a high degree of spectral resolution that enables the detection of single gas components\n[4,5]\n. \nFor natural gas applications, much activity has concentrated on methane detectors based on optical \nabsorption around 1.65 m\n[6,7]\n, with no cross-sensitivity to other flammable gas components. \nAlternatively, non-dispersive infrared instruments can be used at 3.3\u03bcm[8], with undefined cross-\nsensitivity to the other gas components. If such cross-sensitivities are not considered properly, the \nresulting error can be large. Advantica has observed proportional errors as high as 60% in commercial \ninstruments based on non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) technology, that were calibrated using methane \nalone but used to measure natural gas\n[9]\n. \n \nWe have now analysed the possible effect of a methane-specific measurement on the validity of the \nresulting ppm, %LEL and %vol concentration estimates. The analysis is relevant to any gas-specific \nmeasurement and not limited to the optical techniques mentioned above. This paper seeks to establish \nwhether these new developments would be fundamentally compatible with industry requirements, \nusing the following approach: \n(i) Establish benchmark levels of acceptable uncertainty for portable natural gas detectors, drawn \nfrom instrument standards and by comparison with the level of error in established instruments. \n 3 \n(ii) Calculate the expected level of error for a hypothetical, ideal instrument that responds to \nmethane alone. Data on the composition of natural gas in different geographical regions was \ntaken from a variety of sources. \nWe repeated this analysis for a hypothetical instrument able to make simultaneous measurement of \nboth methane and ethane. The approach was considered for two reasons. Firstly, after methane, ethane \nis the flammable component present in the greatest quantities and therefore it may be easier to detect \nthan any of the other flammable components. Secondly, there are regions of the infrared spectrum that \ncontain both individual methane and ethane absorption lines. Indeed a dual methane plus ethane \nmeasurement has been developed\n[10]\n, and we have tested this with a range of gas compositions to \ndemonstrate the validity of the approach.  \n \n2 The composition of natural gas \n \nIf natural gas were composed of methane alone, or indeed if methane and the other components were \npresent at levels that did not change, there would have been no need to do this work. However, their \nproportions are variable and it is necessary to understand the nature and extent of this variation in \ncomposition. Natural gas comprises mainly methane (CH4), with a small proportion of higher \nhydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10) and so on. Inert gases such as \nnitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are present at the level of a few per cent volume, and various \ncompounds can be present in ppm quantities, including the odorant. \n \nPortable gas detectors are used to detect leaks from gas distribution networks, in jobs that can last \nfrom around 30 minutes to an 8 hour shift, in a variety of unpredictable locations within one region or \none organization\u2019s jurisdiction. It is impractical in most cases to have prior knowledge of local \nvariations in gas composition, and in any case compositions in some networks can vary significantly \nover the course of a few minutes\n[11]\n. Therefore, any one instrument will be required to cope with a \nwide range of gas compositions without any changes to its calibration settings. \n \nVarious sources of data are available to assess the degree of compositional variability in the gas \ndistribution network. In the UK, a reliable source comes from the gas chromatographs (Danalyzer 500, \nDaniel Instruments, Houston, USA) operated by the UK gas transmission and distribution companies, \nwhich provide full information on gas composition from samples taken every four minutes. For this \nstudy, over 15,000 compositions recorded by these analysers at network entry points have been \nsampled from a period covering a complete calendar year (2000), so as to include the full range of \npotential seasonal or diurnal effects. Using entry point data gives the worst case for compositional \n 4 \nextrema but cannot quantify any effects caused by subsequent downstream blending of gases from \ndifferent supply points.  \n \nOther sources used in this study cover European networks, from a survey of GERG members (Group \nEurop\u00e9en de Recherches Gazi\u00e8res)\n[12]\n, a series of typical US compositions obtained from an American \nGas Association (AGA) project\n[13]\n and an ad hoc set of typical compositions from the rest of the world \ncollected by Advantica over a period of several years (designated \u201cRoW\u201d). We have presented the \nresults for different geographical regions separately in this paper. For the non-UK studies the data may \nrepresent typical average compositions for different sources and we are therefore uncertain as to the \nfull possible extent of variations for instantaneous compositions. Nevertheless, experience with the \nUK data suggests that the difference in composition between different sources\n[14]\n (such as different gas \nfields) tends to be greater than the range of compositions encountered from a single source.  \n \nOnly those components considered significant were used for calculations, namely the levels of inert \ngases (N2 and CO2) plus hydrocarbons from methane through to C6. Table 1 shows the chief \nflammable constituents of natural gas, their lower explosive limits and the composition range found at \nentry points to the UK gas transmission system. \n \nTable 1.

Note however that IEC 60079-20\n[15]\n defines LELs of many \nhydrocarbons differently, for example the LEL for methane is stated to be 4.4%vol and \nLELs of many other hydrocarbons are also reduced. This change would not significantly \nalter the conclusions of this study, because we are concerned with proportional and \nrelative changes or errors in the LELs of different gas mixtures. \n \n 5 \nThere are two points to note from Table 1. Firstly, the range of concentrations of the non-methane \nhydrocarbons can be relatively large. Secondly, the LELs of the different constituents are \nsignificantly different, with flammability generally increasing with increased length of the carbon \nchain. Therefore, the LEL of the resulting mixture can vary, and the variation in the non-methane \ncomponents could cause significant errors for a methane - specific %LEL detector. These errors are \nquantified in section 5.  \n \nAfter methane, ethane is typically the most significant flammable component, but the approach taken \nhere could equally be applied to any other secondary component. The proportions of methane and \nethane reported for the gas compositions used in this study are displayed graphically in Figure 1. \n \n70 80 90 100\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nmethane proportion \/ vol %\ne\nth\na\nn\ne\n p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\n \/\n v\no\nl \n%\nUS\nUK\nEU\nRoW\n85 90 95\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nmethane proportion \/ vol %\ne\nth\na\nn\ne\n p\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\n \/\n v\no\nl \n% Expansion: \nUK only\n \nFigure 1. Proportions of methane and ethane for the gas compositions used in this study. \n \n2.1 LELs of natural gas mixtures \n \nIn a mixture comprising different flammable and non-flammable components, the determination of \nthe true LEL of the combined gas mixture is complex, especially when the mixture itself contains a \nproportion of inert gases such as N2 and CO2. The LEL arises not simply from the amount of energy \nthat would be released on combustion, but also from a consideration of flame transport factors. In \nour work, the true LEL of each gas mixture was calculated using the method established by Coward \nand Jones\n[16]\n, which consists of the following steps. \n1. The mixture is dissected into simpler component mixtures, each of which consists of only one \nflammable gas or only one flammable gas plus all or part of the inert gases. According to Coward \nand Jones, this dissection is \u201csomewhat arbitrary\u201d, within certain well-defined limits. In practice \n 6 \nfor many natural gas mixtures, the inert gases would be allocated to a component mixture with \nmethane, the largest single constituent, and \/ or ethane, the second.  \n2.  The LELs of the simple mixtures containing inerts are then determined from charts given by \nCoward and Jones\n[16]\n. \n3.  The LEL of the overall mixture is then given by the equation \n \n31 2\n1 2 3\n100\nmix\n%\nLEL\npp p\nN N N\n (1) \n Where p1, p2, p3 etc are the proportions of the simple component mixtures, and N1, N2, N3 etc are \nthe respective LELs of these mixtures determined in step 2. \n \nWe have used the above method in this work to quickly determine the \u201ctrue\u201d LEL of a wide range of \nnatural gas mixtures. The validity of the approach was examined by Jones in 1929 in a series of \nexperiments to determine the true LEL of a variety of gas mixtures, which values were then \ncompared with the results of the calculation above\n[17]\n. However, this study considered gas mixtures \nthat were not representative of natural gases; in particular they contained significant quantities of \ninert gas (50% - 85%), which may be considered as a major source of uncertainty. For the 7 mixtures \nwith under 75% inert content, agreement between calculated and measured values was between 0 \nand 8% of the experimental LEL. We consider the maximum error to be somewhat large compared \nto the instrumental requirement discussed here, albeit for uncharacteristic gas mixtures.  \n \nAn approach used to support the Coward and Jones method is to calculate burning velocities for the \ndifferent mixtures in an iterative combustion model, however this is computationally intensive. The \nmethod involves calculation of burning velocities using the Sandia Laboratories PREMIX code\n[18]\n, \nutilizing the validated GRI-Mech reaction mechanism\n[19]\n. The rationale is that if a flame cannot \npropagate (i.e. has a burning velocity close to zero) then it must be outside of the flammable range. \nFor this work, repeated iterations were made with adjustment to the mixture composition of the \nunreacted gas starting at stoichiometric conditions and then progressing to leaner mixtures until the \nburning velocity was close to zero. A small extrapolation was then performed and the LEL defined \nas the value obtained from the intercept. Three extreme example mixtures were chosen and the \nresulting LELs compared with the results of the above method. Agreement was within 0.07 %vol or \n1.5 % of the LEL value. How this might affect the results of our calculations then depends on \nwhether this potential error is independent of, or correlated with, our calculated instrumental errors. \nIn the latter (worst) case, the proportional error in our calculated figures could be up to \u00b11.5%, which \nis low compared to potential instrumental errors considered in this paper. \n \n 7 \n3 Standards for gas detectors \n \nWe now need to establish the level of measurement error that might be acceptable for portable gas \ndetectors. Sources of such information include international standards and the sometimes more \nstringent internal company standards; where organizations such as National Grid (NG) are \nconcerned, such standards are made available to interested parties on request.  \n \nStandards considered in this study are compared in Table 2. Allowable errors vary through the gas \nconcentration range and with environmental conditions. For the purpose of simplifying the \ncomparison, one example set of conditions (concentration, temperature change, pressure change) has \nbeen chosen on each range.  \n \nStandard IEC \/ EN 60079 part 29\n[20]\n covers performance requirements for flammable gas detectors \non the %LEL and %vol ranges, and includes testing with \u201cother gases\u201d representative of those for \nwhich the apparatus is claimed to be suitable. This allows for testing with a range of natural gas \nmixtures. The errors allowed under IEC \/ EN 60079 for \u201cother gases\u201d have therefore been adopted \nhere as benchmarks representative of worldwide gas detection applications. \n \nIn the UK, internal company standards maintained by National Grid are effectively adopted by the \nmajority of the UK gas industry and have been used as the basis for UK-relevant benchmarks. For \n%LEL and %volume measurements the relevant NG standard is INQ3\n[21]\n while the draft standard \nINQ4\n[22]\n relates to parts per million by volume (ppm) measurements, and these are historically \nrelated to the expected type test performance of two established instruments: respectively the GMI \nGascoseeker (GMI, Gas Measurement Instruments Ltd, Renfrew, Scotland) and the Telegan Gas-Tec \nFID (Telegan Gas Detection, Abingdon, UK). As there is no explicit consideration of \u201cother gases\u201d \nhere, we have instead taken the allowable error in response to pressure variation as a benchmark, this \nbeing another uncontrolled variable. \n \n \n 8 \nTable 2 (a).

Lower (ppm) concentrations of natural gas are typically used (a) to \nconfirm the absence or presence of a gas leak, and (b) to locate the source. The first requirement \ndemands a reliable and accurate zero, the second requirement demands high sensitivity and sufficient \naccuracy to enable areas of higher and lower gas concentration to be identified. The ppm application \nis therefore less demanding in terms of scale accuracy than for %LEL and %vol readings.  \n 9 \n \n4 Performance of existing instruments \n4.1 Gas test mixtures \n \nA series of gas test mixtures was chosen by reference to the UK composition data described in \nsection 2. Mixtures were chosen from a range of possible compositions to give worst case test \nconditions for instruments, having a wide range of compositional variation within a small number of \ntest samples, as shown in Table 3. They represent a worst test case for UK instruments with cross-\nresponse to methane and ethane, having extremes of proportions of these components while \nexcluding outliers. Mixtures A, B and D were chosen for their extremes of composition, while \nmixture C was chosen as a median, central representative so as not to neglect the mainstream.  \n \nTable 3.

The instrument was tested on the %LEL range, this being arguably the most \nimportant for safety reasons and the most difficult for alternative, optical technologies to achieve \ngood performance. It was calibrated using the GMI\u2019s automatic gas delivery and calibration system \nimmediately prior to testing. Although the calibration procedure used methane, the Gascoseeker used \na \u201cnatural gas\u201d calibration setting during measurement, designed to take account of the average \nmethane deficit of natural gas by scaling the raw measurements by a factor of 1.1 before displaying \nthe results. \n \nEach of the gas mixtures was blended with hydrocarbon free air to a concentration of 2.5 %vol \n(approximately 50 %LEL) by the cylinder supplier (Scott Specialty Gases) and provided with a \ncertificate of analysis.  \n \nThe measurement errors are shown in Table 4. We need to consider the error range or worst case \nerror rather than the average error here, since instruments should be capable of operation across the \nwhole range of gas compositions that they could reasonably encounter, and because we have no \nevidence for the distribution of compositional variation.  \n \n(a) ethane variation (b) inerts variation \n \n85 90 95\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\no\nf\ne\nth\na\nn\ne\n\/\n%\nvo\nl\nproportion of methane \/ %vol\nD C\nB\nA\n85 90 95\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\no\nf\nin\ne\nrt\ns\n\/\n%\nvo\nl\nproportion of methane \/ %vol\nD\nC\nB\nA\ntest compositionsUK sampled data\n 11 \nTable 4.

Although the instrument was designed to measure natural gas, which should have \nresulted in it being rescaled to account for the average methane deficit, a systematic error remained. \nAs we are interested here in the error due to compositional variation, there is potential to improve the \nresults by further rescaling, to give a best case benchmark performance proportional error of \u00b12% \nresulting from natural gas variation alone. This is small compared with the normal instrumental error \nfor a single measurement (\u00b14%). As there is little point in considering errors below this level, these \ntests point to a benchmark allowable proportional error of \u00b14% on the %LEL range. \n \n5 Calculated performance of proposed gas - specific detectors \n \nWe took a series of gas compositions and calculated the measurement error that would result from \nmaking methane-specific measurements, on the %volume, %LEL and ppm scales. For this pseudo \nMonte Carlo technique, the range of resulting errors was of interest rather than the standard \ndeviation. The technique is appropriate to this case for a number of reasons. Firstly, although the \nrange of proportions of each gas component in natural gas is well known, the concentrations of the \ncomponents are correlated via the characteristics of different gas fields and via the network entry \nquality criteria or interchangeability rules that govern the full range of allowed compositions in the \nnetwork\n[23]\n. Secondly, we had no information concerning the relative distribution of gas \n 12 \ncompositions following uncertain degrees of downstream mixing in the network, and therefore could \nnot estimate the likelihood of encountering any one composition. In any case, gas detectors would be \nrequired to make correct measurements for the full range of acceptable gas compositions in the \nnetwork. Finally, the method was simple to use, and should be representative of the extremes of what \nwould be encountered in practice, given a sufficiently long and well-chosen list of real compositions. \n \nBasil and Jamieson\n[24]\n have used a similar approach to calculating uncertainties in gas metering \nsystems. The method successfully modelled measurement errors in complex systems, and was found \nto compare well with traditional methods of combining individual measurement errors that arise in \ndifferent parts of a system.  \n \nHere, expected errors were calculated for hypothetical detectors, such as those based on high-\nresolution infrared spectroscopy, capable of making component-specific measurements of methane \nand \/ or ethane. It was assumed that our hypothetical instruments were able to make perfect \nmeasurements; real instrumental errors would add further uncertainty to a measurement. For %LEL \nmeasurements, the true LEL of each gas mixture was calculated using the method established by \nCoward and Jones\n[16]\n, as implemented in the commercial software GasVLe\n[25]\n. The hypothetical \ninstrument reading, based on the methane and \/ or ethane content, was compared with this figure to \ngive the proportional error.  \n \nFor proposed methane \u2013 only detectors, we simply took the methane proportion in the gas mixture as \nthe concentration that the instrument would report, and calculated %LEL concentrations using the \nLEL figure in Table 1. Where methane plus ethane detectors have been postulated, a two-component \napproximation to a full natural gas mixture was used as shown below.  \nOn the ppm and %volume scale, 21 CCCmix  (2) \nOn the %LEL scale,  \n2\n2\n1\n1\nLEL\nC\nLEL\nC\nLEL% mix  (3) \nLEL1 and LEL2 are the LELs of the individual gases in units of %vol, whereas C1 and C2 are the \nconcentrations of these components, also in units of %vol. Equation (3) has been postulated for \nsimple two-component mixtures by Coward and Jones\n[16]\n. \n \n \n 13 \n5.1 Errors in measurements of concentration on the ppm and %vol scales \n \nOn the ppm and %volume scales, measurements are made in direct proportion to the concentration of \ngas in air by volume. The errors associated with a perfect methane-specific gas detector will \ntherefore be a direct consequence of the methane deficit in natural gas, ie that fraction of natural gas \nthat does not comprise methane. Figure 3 shows the resulting errors as a function of the proportion of \nmethane in the natural gas mixture, for UK, GERG, US and rest of world (RoW) gas compositions. \nAs expected, the straight line illustrates the direct relationship between the underestimate in \nconcentration and the proportional lack of methane in the natural gas.  \n \n \nFigure 3. Spread of calculated errors in methane-only based measurements of natural gas on the ppm \nor %vol scales, versus the proportion of methane in the natural gas, for various gas compositions. A \nstraight line through the origin follows directly from the mathematical analysis. \n \nFor the worldwide gas compositions (including US, EU and RoW), the error would lie between -2% \nand -31% of the true gas concentration, and likewise between \u20135% and \u201315% for UK compositions. \nThe systematic portion of the error could be removed by either calibrating instruments with a \n\u201cstandardized\u201d natural gas mixture, or by calibrating with methane and then multiplying the \ninstrument reading by a small factor. This normalization would reduce the central error to zero and \nleave a variable error element of approximately 18% (world) and \u00b15.5% (UK).  \n \nOn the ppm scale, such error levels should not present problems in locating leaks, and would be \nwithin error limits for other variables as defined in Table 2, so the use of a methane - specific \ndetector could be acceptable in this application. For %volume scales (see Table 2) the errors are just \ncompatible with IEC\/EN gas detector standards (worldwide gases) and with NG standards (UK \n70 80 90 100\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\nmethane proportion \/ vol %\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\na\nl \ne\nrr\no\nr \nin\n r\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\n \/\n %\nUS\nUK\nEU\nRoW methane proportion \/ vol %\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\na\nl \ne\nrr\no\nr \nin\n r\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\n \/\n %\nExpansion: \nUK only\n85 90 95\n-15\n-10\n-5\n 14 \ngases), but it should be noted that there would be little headroom to allow for further instrument \nerrors. \n \nSupplementing the methane \u2013 only measurement with an additional measurement of the \nconcentration of ethane, according to equation (2), reduces the proportional errors. Figure 4 \nillustrates the non-normalized errors, which would lie in the range 0 to -23% (world) and -2 to -9% \n(UK). If normalized to give zero central error, they would be reduced to \u00b112% (world) and \u00b13.5% \n(UK). \n \nFigure 4. Spread of calculated errors in methane plus ethane based measurements of natural gas on \nthe ppm or %vol scales, versus the proportion of methane in the natural gas, for various gas \ncompositions. \n \n5.2 Errors in measurements of concentration on the %LEL scale \n \nA measurement on the %LEL scale indicates how close the gas concentration is to forming a \npotentially explosive mixture in air. Taking methane as an example, a concentration of 4.9% volume \nis equivalent to 100% LEL (see Table 1). Thus, a true measurement on the LEL scale depends not \nonly on the amount of gas present in air, but also on the concentration at which that gas mixture is at \nits LEL. \n \nCalculation of LELs of given gas compositions is implemented in the software GasVLe\n[25]\n, and \nFigure 5 illustrates the range of LELs calculated for the gas compositions used in this study.  \n \n70 80 90 100\n-20\n-10\n0\nmethane proportion \/ vol %\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\na\nl \ne\nrr\no\nr \nin\n r\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\n\/ \n%\nUS\nUK\nEU\nRoW methane proportion \/ vol %\np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\na\nl \ne\nrr\no\nr \nin\n r\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\n \/\n %\nExpansion: \nUK only\n85 90 95\n0\n-10\n-5\n 15 \n \nFigure 5.

For worldwide \ncompositions the error range is from 0 to \u201333%, whereas for UK gases alone the range is from \u20136% \nto \u201320% LEL. Renormalizing to zero central error gives ranges of \u00b120% of the reading (worldwide) \nor \u00b18% of reading (UK). \n \n  \nFigure 6.

A high level of inert gases would act to raise the LEL of the gas \nmixture and could result in an overestimate in the leak concentration in %LEL. \n \nThese two effects can combine to increase the level of uncertainty in the measurement.  \n \nAs described previously, it would be possible to make a combined methane plus ethane based \nmeasurement, using equation (3). The resulting spread of errors is shown in Figure 7 for worldwide \nand UK gas compositions. \n \n \nFigure 7. Use of a combined methane plus ethane detector has reduced the spread of calculated \nproportional errors in the %LEL reading. \n \nThe figures illustrate reduced error levels for an idealized, hypothetical gas detector. Proportional \nerrors lie in the range +0.5% to -16% of the reading (worldwide) and -1.5% to -7% (UK). \nRenormalizing the data gives ranges of \u00b19% of the reading (world) and \u00b13% of the reading (UK). \nThis is a significant improvement on methane \u2013 only calculations and compares well with the \nbenchmark error levels in section 3. \n \n6 Summary of performance benchmarks and calculations \n \nWe have considered two possible approaches to benchmarks: \n(i) To accept a level of performance consistent with established instruments, giving a more \nstringent performance criterion of around \u00b1 4% of the reading on the %LEL scale.

Two approaches are possible; (i) calibrate with a \u201cstandardized\u201d natural gas instead of pure \nmethane in air, or (ii) multiply the instrument response in software by a correction factor. It has been \n 18 \nassumed in our calculations that the readings on each scale can be renormalized to remove the \naverage systematic composition-related error and leave only the unpredictable variability. \n \nErrors in ppm measurements are low, and the requirements for this application are not stringent, so a \nmethane-specific detector should be suitable. This is fortunate because ethane would be difficult to \ndetect on this scale, since it makes up only a small proportion of natural gas, which would already be \nconsiderably diluted. Sensor technologies for ethane that could be readily incorporated into a low-\ncost, hand held gas leak detector are currently not available for low ppm measurements.  \n \nFor %LEL estimates, the situation is worsened by the fact that compositional variation affects the \nLEL of the gas as well as the ability of the instrument to detect it. The requirements for instruments \non this scale are very stringent, since these measurements play an important role in safety-critical \ndecisions. Methane-specific measurements show fundamental errors that are larger than we would \nideally accept. Adding a simultaneous ethane measurement gives a significant improvement, \nreducing measurement errors to an acceptable level and enabling any instrument to cope with the \npresent degree of variability of composition in gas supplies.  \n \nAnticipated error levels are the same for the ppm and %volume scales, but the requirements for \n%volume measurements are more stringent. Comparing the two in Table 5, we may conclude on this \nscale that methane-only measurements give rise to errors that may be on the margins of acceptability. \nThese uncertainties give little headroom to allow for further instrument errors to creep in, and an \nadditional ethane measurement is perhaps desirable. \n \n7 Experimental demonstration \n \nExperiments were performed to assess the performance of gas-specific measurements of methane \nplus ethane made through tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), in comparison with \nthe pellistor based instrument described in section 4.2. Both techniques were assessed on the %LEL \nscale with the test mixtures given in Table 3, considered representative of natural gas compositions \nencountered in the UK. \n \nWe are grateful for the loan of a TDLAS based prototype gas detector, which has been previously \ndescribed\n[10]\n, from its developers Oliver Hennig and co-workers at Siemens ZT, Munich. The \ninstrument made independent and gas-specific measurements of methane and ethane and contained \nan implementation of the 2-component approximation to the %LEL scale according to equation (3). \n 19 \nIt was tested alongside the GMI Gascoseeker in the same series of experiments as described in \nsection 4.2. The results are shown in Table 6 and are directly comparable with those in Table 4. \n \nTable 6.

There is potential to reduce the central error to zero to give an \nerror range of \u00b13% for natural gas compositional variation alone, with instrument errors adding to \nthe overall level of measurement uncertainty. All these figures are in excellent agreement with the \nresults of calculations in section 5.2. The study therefore provides a practical confirmation of the \neffectiveness of using independent measurements of methane plus ethane on the most stringent \n%LEL scale, with overall performance similar to that of a standard pellistor based instrument. \n \n8 Conclusions \n \nThis study has considered the effects of the variability of gas composition on a hypothetical gas \ndetector, able to make methane-specific or methane plus ethane based measurements of the \nconcentration of natural gas in air. A practical demonstration of the latter approach has been tested \nusing a prototype instrument based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. \n \nVariations in the composition of natural gas could give rise to errors in the concentration reading of a \nmethane-specific detector. These errors are fundamental to the application but their extent depends \n 20 \non the geographic area within which the instrument will be used. They have been calculated for \nhypothetical instruments that perform perfectly. Even under these idealized conditions, the range of \nanticipated errors could be significant; further instrument errors would combine to increase the \noverall measurement uncertainty. A combined methane plus ethane measuring instrument has been \npostulated to reduce the errors to an acceptable level, particularly on the %LEL scale. For any \nmethane- and \/ or ethane- based measurement of natural gas concentration, a correction should also \nbe made to remove the systematic underestimate in the instrument reading.  \n \nSince this issue of gas compositional variation is only partially covered in instrument standards, it \nhas been necessary to use benchmark levels of error in order to decide whether measurement \nuncertainties would be significant. This has necessarily involved an element of judgement. It is \nhoped that the results have been presented with sufficient transparency to allow the reader to reach \ntheir own conclusions about their significance, and to allow for the use of different benchmarks in \nregions whose compositions show a different level of variability. \n \nGas compositional variability has not been a concern for more traditional instruments, but could lead \nto problems with the acceptance of new technologies. Some optical gas detection instruments are \nsimply designed to respond to methane and are typically tested using methane alone. However, for \ngas detection applications that demand high accuracy, this study shows that gas sensors should be \ndesigned, selected and tested with due consideration to the other components of natural gas. \n \n9 Acknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful to Oliver Hennig, Rainer Strzoda, Max Fleischer and others at Siemens ZT for the \nloan of their prototype TDLAS based instrument.
