INTRODUCTION \n Following on from the major flooding caused by the 1953 U.K east coast storm surge \nevent, the main focus in storm surge modelling has been the prediction of storm surge \nelevations on the European shelf.  Of particular importance has been their accurate prediction \nin shallow coastal regions where flooding can occur during major storms.  In regions such as \nthe Irish Sea and North Sea, early research showed that limited area finite difference models \nfailed to reproduce the observed surge due to their neglect of shelf wide wind events (the \nexternal surge).  Consequently early storm surge computations were performed with shelf \nwide finite difference models (e.g. Davies and Flather 1977), that necessarily used coarse \ngrids due to computational limitations, hence their resolution was poor in coastal regions.  \nSince the main objective of these models was the computation of surge elevations, the two \ndimensional hydrodynamic equations were used. \n With enhancements in computing power, finite difference grids in shelf wide models \nwere refined to the order of 12 km (Davies et al. 1998, 2000) and local (e.g. west coast of \nBritain) models of grid resolution 7 km (Davies and Jones 1992a, hereafter DJ92) or less \n(Jones and Davies 1996, Jones and Davies, 1998, hereafter JD98) were developed.  However, \nsuch local models required open boundary input from a coarser shelf wide model, or a model \nwhich could account for changes produced by shelf wide winds.  For example DJ92 used a 7 \nkm resolution west coast of Britain model to simulate the November 1977 major surge event.  \nFor this simulation far field effects were taken into account using observations along the open \nboundaries.  However, results showed that the 7 km grid of this model was not sufficiently \nfine to accurately resolve the local increase in storm surge elevation in the eastern Irish Sea.  \nConsequently in subsequent work, this model was used to provide boundary conditions for a \n 4 \nlimited area eastern Irish Sea model of 1 km resolution, resulting in improved surge accuracy \nin the region (JD98).  A similar approach of using a high resolution (of order 1 km) limited \narea model of the North Channel of the Irish Sea, forced by a coarse grid large area model, \nwas used by Davies et al (2001) for a detailed study of tidal and wind forced currents in that \narea.  Although this approach of nesting a high resolution limited area finite difference model \nwithin a coarser grid model enables a local improvement in resolution, if the nesting is two \nway then there may be problems at the interface between the two grids.  In addition as shown \nby Davies and Hall (2002) in regions of rapidly changing current magnitude and direction \nproduced by local changes in topography, a nesting approach could give rise to significant \nerrors in the currents.  An alternative approach, the method examined here, is to use a finite \nelement technique in which the grid resolution varies gradually in space.  By this means a \ncoarse mesh can be used in offshore regions where the water is deep and surge elevations and \ncurrents show little spatial variability.  As the water shallows and surge intensity and spatial \nvariability increase in the nearshore regions then the grid is refined in these regions.  In \naddition surge propagation into estuaries can be readily accomplished without nesting. \n The finite element model with its ability to refine the mesh in nearshore regions has \nbeen very successful in a number of problems (e.g. Werner 1995, Ip et al 1998, Jones 2002, \nFernandes et al 2002, 2004, Walters 2005, Levasseur et al 2007, Nicolle and Karpytchev \n2007).  Although in theory the grading of the mesh is arbitrary, in practice the computation of \nan optimal mesh is complex (e.g. Greenberg et al 2007, Legrand et al 2006, 2007 and Hagen \net al 2001, 2002) and in the calculations presented here in order to make rigorous \ncomparisons with earlier finite difference and finite element models, no attempt was made to \nproduce an optimal mesh. \n Previous calculations using a finite element (TELEMAC) model of the west coast of \nBritain showed that it could reproduce the dominant (M2 component) tide in the region (Jones \n 5 \nand Davies 2005), to an accuracy comparable to an existing finite difference model (Davies \nand Jones 1992b).  Also recent calculations showed (Jones and Davies 2007a) that the model \nwas comparable in accuracy to both west coast (Davies and Jones 1992b) and high resolution \neastern Irish Sea models (Jones and Davies 1996) at reproducing the M2, S2, N2, K1 and 01 \ncomponents of the tide.  In addition by refining the element size in the eastern Irish Sea \nregion the higher harmonics of the tide could be accurately reproduced (Jones and Davies \n2007b).  Also tidal residual currents in the region could be accurately simulated (Jones and \nDavies 2007c) and the artificial flow in the nearshore region due to the \u201cstair case\u201d \nrepresentation of the coast in finite difference models (Davies and Jones 1996) was not \npresent.  Recent calculations (Jones and Davies 2006) using this finite element model of the \nwest coast of Britain, showed that its response to steady orthogonal wind forcing was \nconsistent to that found with well established and proven finite difference models (Jones and \nDavies 2003a,b).  In addition the finer Eastern Irish Sea resolution in the finite element model \nshowed small scale wind induced circulation features that were not present in the finite \ndifference model (Jones and Davies 2003a,b). These calculations suggest that the finite \nelement model developed previously should be able to reproduce storm surges in the eastern \nIrish Sea to an accuracy comparable to the nested high resolution (1 km) eastern Irish Sea and \ncoarser (7 km) finite difference west coast models used previously. \n Besides investigating the response of the west coast of Britain to wind forcing, the \nobjective of these earlier calculations namely Jones and Davies (2003a), Jones and Davies \n(2006, 2008) was to examine the processes influencing surges in the region and the role of \ntide-surge interaction.  However, the objective of this paper is to use the previous west coast \nfinite element model, that has been validated against a range of tidal constituents, to examine \nthe mechanisms (namely external and internal surge generation) producing the storm surge of \nNovember 1977.  In addition because this surge event has been computed with a range of \n 6 \nfinite difference models, the relative accuracy of the finite element model can be examined \nby comparing with observations and finite difference solutions.  To ensure that this is a \nmeaningful comparison, the same regional extent, open boundary forcing and meteorological \nforcing to that used previously (DJ92 and JD98) was applied.  In addition the topography \nused in the model was identical over the Irish and Celtic Seas to that used in DJ92, and in the \neastern Irish Sea to that in JD98.  By this means a rigorous comparison with these earlier \nfinite difference models could be performed.  The surge of November 1977 was chosen \nbecause an accurate meteorological data set was available with which to force the model. \n The finite element model is discussed in the next section, with following sections \ndescribing the meteorological forcing and detailed model\/data comparisons.  A final section \nsummarises the main results. \n2. THE FINITE ELEMENT MODEL AND FORCING \n Since the focus of the paper is the application of a finite element model to the \nprediction of surge elevations in the Irish Sea for the major storm events in November 1977 it \nis sufficient to solve the two dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic equations.  \nHowever since the region (Fig. 1) spans a range of latitudes, spherical coordinates were used \nas in earlier finite difference models.  As the form of the non-linear hydrodynamic equations \nusing these coordinates is given elsewhere (DJ92, JD98) they will not be repeated here.  As \ndetails of the numerical methods used in TELEMAC to solve the hydrodynamic equations \nhave been reviewed in Jones and Davies (2006, 2007a,b,c) and references therein, they will \nnot be repeated here.  In order to compare results with previous finite difference solutions, the \nregion covered by the model was identical to that used in DJ92.  In addition the water depth \ndistribution was based on DJ92, with the addition of more accurate water depths and coastal \nresolution in the eastern Irish Sea taken from JD98. \n 7 \n The water depth distribution in the region is characterized by depths of the order of \n100 m in the Celtic Sea, deepening to 150 m at the south west of this region (Fig. 1).  Within \nthe Irish Sea on its western side there is a deep channel, with water depths up to 100 m, \nalthough on its eastern side the water is much shallower (less than 50 m) with extensive \nnearshore regions where the water depth is below 25 m (Fig. 2).  In these nearshore regions, \n\u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs over the tidal cycle.  Water depths in the North Channel can \nexceed 150 m (Fig. 1) with average depths to the north of this of order 100 m. \n As tidal friction and tide-surge interaction are important in the region, the five \ndominant tidal constituents, namely M2, S2, N2, K1 and O1 were included within all the \ncalculations as input along the open boundary.  This is consistent with the finite difference \nsolution given in DJ92.  It is important to note that this tidal forcing was used in all \ncalculations, namely those including the computation of the external, internal and total surge \n(see later).  Previous tidal calculations (Jones and Davies 2007a) showed that the finite \nelement grid used in the present calculations (Fig. 3) could accurately reproduce these \nconstituents and the associated higher harmonics produced by non-linear interaction in the \nregion.  Although in the eastern Irish Sea storm surge calculations of JD98, using a limited \narea high resolution (1 km) model of the region, the input storm surge on the open boundary \nwas taken without adjustment from the coarser (7 km) west coast model, the tidal input along \nthe boundary was adjusted to give an accurate representation of the tide in the region.  In the \npresent finite element calculation no tidal or storm surge adjustments were made to try and \nimprove model accuracy, nor was the topography modified from that used in JD98. \n To be consistent with DJ92 and JD98, identical meteorological forcing for the period \n7-17 November 1977 was used, and the surge was computed by subtracting a tide only \nsolution from one involving tidal and meteorological forcing.  As a detailed discussion of the \nmeteorological forcing is presented in DJ92, it will not be given here.  However, as shown in \n 8 \nDJ92 the surge within the region covered by the west coast model (Fig. 3) is influenced by \nboth local winds and \u201cfar field\u201d effects produced by wind forcing outside the model and the \nresulting flow into the region.  Consequently as in DJ92 it is necessary to take account of this \nexternal effect along the open boundary of the model.  To be consistent with DJ92 this was \naccomplished by linearly interpolating observed surge elevations from Castletownsend and \nNewlyn along the southern boundary of the model.  In addition observations from Malin were \nimposed along the northern boundary of the model. \n To understand the influence of the external surge, and local wind forced surge, upon \nthe total surge, three calculations were performed with the finite element model using the grid \ngiven in Fig. 3.  Initially (Calc 1) the model was run with only boundary forcing to determine \nfar field effects (external surge).  Subsequently (Calc 2) only local meteorological forcing \nwas applied (internal surge) and finally (Calc 3) the full surge was determined. \n3. STORM SURGE CALCULATIONS \n3.1 External surge \nIn an initial calculation (Calc 1) the model was forced using only the external surge \ntaken from observations (see DJ92 for details), applied along the open boundary, although as \nstated previously tidal forcing through the open boundary was included.  Consequently no \nwind or atmospheric pressure gradient forcing was applied over the model domain.  In this \ncalculation to be consistent with the coarse grid (7 km resolution) finite difference model of \nthe whole domain (Fig. 1), observations from Castletownsend and Newlyn were interpolated \nalong the southern boundary of the model.  Observations from Malin were imposed along the \nnorthern boundary.  This forcing was identical to that used in the coarse grid model of DJ92. \nTime series (Fig. 4a) of the storm surge elevation at a number of ports in the eastern \nIrish Sea (for locations see Fig. 2) showed that although some of the main features of the \nsurge at Douglas could be reproduced through open boundary forcing (the external surge), the \n 9 \nmodel significantly underestimates surge peaks, which occurred at times of maximum wind \nforcing.  However, at other times surge elevations were reproduced, suggesting that these \narose from \u201cfar field forcing\u201d that propagated into the region through the open boundaries.  In \naddition the underestimation of the surge increased rapidly at shallow water locations such as \nLiverpool, Workington and Hilbre, suggesting that local wind forcing in the regions was a \nmajor contributor to the surge. \n3.2 Internal surge \nIn a subsequent calculation (Calc 2), no external surge was applied along the open \nboundary, although as previously tidal forcing was included, however now meteorological \nforcing was provided by wind stresses and pressure gradients.  Time series at all the eastern \nIrish Sea ports (Fig. 4b) show that the model could reproduce the major features of the \nobserved surge.  In particular the rapid increase in surge elevations to give peak values at 00 \nhr 12\/Nov and during 14\/Nov at times of strong wind forcing were reproduced.  However at \nother times of weak wind forcing the model failed to reproduce the small negative external \nsurge.  As discussed above this was due to external forcing.  Although the observed time \nvariation of the surge is reproduced by the computed internal surge its magnitude is below the \nobserved.  However, the magnitude of the computed surge increases as the water shallows, \nsuggesting that the contribution of the internal surge to the total surge elevation will be more \nimportant in shallow than deep water regions. \n3.3 Total surge \nIn a final calculation (Calc 3) the model was forced with both the open boundary \nsurge elevation as in Calc 1 and with the meteorological forcing as in Calc 2.  As previously \n(Calcs 1 and 2) tidal forcing was included in the model.  Time series at Douglas (Fig. 4c), \nlocated in deeper water on the western side of the eastern Irish Sea shows that the finite \nelement model can reproduce the observed features of the surge at this location.  In particular \n 10 \nthe surge peaks that occur at 00 hr 12\/Nov and during the 14\/Nov.  In addition the time series \nis in close agreement with that computed by JD98.  It is interesting that both the time series \ncomputed with the present finite element model and the finite difference model (FREISM) of \nJD98 are in such good agreement considering that JD98, used a large area coarse grid model \n(7 km) of the region shown in Fig. 1, to provide boundary conditions for a 1 km model of the \neastern Irish Sea.  In this 1 km model the N2 and S2 tides together with the higher harmonics \nof the tide along the open boundary had been adjusted to give the best possible solution in the \ninterior.  In the present finite element model, no such adjustment was made, and tide and \nsurge have been propagated through the whole domain and into the eastern Irish Sea.  This \nsuggests that both the tide (a freely propagating wave) and the storm surge (a \nmeteorologically forced event) can accurately propagate through the unstructured finite \nelement mesh (Fig. 3).  At shallow water locations e.g. Liverpool, both the present and \nprevious (JD98) solutions exhibit similar features, with both models failing to reproduce the \nfull magnitude of the surges that occurred at 00 hr 12\/Nov and during the 14\/Nov.  This could \nbe due to a lack of detailed local meteorological forcing in the region, which Calc 2, has \nshown to be important in shallow water, or a lack of local resolution.  In the case of the local \neastern Irish Sea finite difference model this was limited to 1 km.  Although the finite \nelement model uses finer elements in this region, in order to perform a \u201clike with like\u201d \ncomparison identical topography based on a 1 km grid was used.  This suggests that in order \nto take full advantage of the finite element model\u2019s ability to refine the grid in nearshore \nregions, with a possible improvement in accuracy, higher nearshore bathymetry is required.  \nAlthough differences in the two solutions are evident at Liverpool, the two solutions are in \ncloser agreement at Heysham and Workington.  Interestingly at Heysham the finite element \nmodel shows some higher frequency \u201cspikes\u201d between 18 hr 11\/Nov and 00 hr 12\/Nov that \nwere not present in the finite difference solution.  The reason for this will be discussed later, \n 11 \nwhen the dynamics of the surge in the Morecambe Bay area and its distribution over the \nwhole west coast are examined. \nIn order to quantify the accuracy of the storm surge computed with the finite element \nmodel, and compare with earlier finite different solutions (Jones and Davies (2001)) root \nmean square (rms) errors based on differences between observed and computed surge were \ndetermined at Douglas and Liverpool.  These ports were chosen to represent deep and \nshallow locations, and because a continuous observed time series was available.  Besides \ncomputing errors for the whole period (Table 1), sub-periods as in Jones and Davies (2001) \nwere used.  The first period is from 00h 9\/Nov to 11h 12\/Nov covering the first peak.  The \nsecond is an extended version of the first, namely from 00h 9\/Nov till 23h 13\/Nov, in essence \nthe period up to the start of the second peak.  The third period again starts at 00h 9\/Nov, until \n23h 14\/Nov and hence covers both surge peaks. \nFrom rms errors in Table 1 it is evident that at Liverpool for all the periods, and the \ntotal, the rms error from the finite difference calculation is slightly less than that from the \nfinite element model.  There was however no significant difference in rms errors at Douglas \nwhich is located in deeper water.  The fact that both models use the same topography, and no \nattempt was made to improve the accuracy of the finite element model by enhancing local \ntopography, suggest that the difference in rms errors at Liverpool is not due to resolution.  As \ndiscussed previously in the 1 km model of the eastern Irish Sea used by Jones and Davies \n(2001), the tidal input had been adjusted along the open boundary to given an optimal \nsolution in the interior.  Since in the present finite element model no such adjustment was \nmade, and tide-surge interaction in the eastern Irish Sea has an important influence on the \nsurge at Liverpool but not Douglas, it suggests this may account for the very small difference \nin rms errors between the models at Liverpool. \n 12 \nAlthough calculations (Jones and Davies 2008) have shown that tide-surge interaction \nis important in this region and hence a realistic storm surge could not be produced without \nincluding the tide, calculations showed that when the external and internal storm surges were \nadded together (in essence time series in Figs. 4a and 4b) then the total surge was not \nsignificantly different (differences of less than 5 cm in the time series) from that found in the \nfull surge calculation.  This arises mainly from the fact that a large domain model was used, \nand hence the external surge was small and only significant at times when the internal surge \nwas negligible. \n4. STORM SURGE DYNAMICS \nIn order to understand the time variation of the surge within the eastern Irish Sea, and \ncompare its offshore distribution in detail with that from the 7 km west coast model (DJ92) \nand 1 km eastern Irish Sea model (JD98) it is essential to consider the time varying response \nof the whole region to storm forcing. \nConsideri initially the first major wind period (namely 12 hr 11\/Nov to 06 hr 12\/Nov, \nsee DJ92 for detailed meteorological charts).  During this period there were winds from the \nsouth-west over the region that forced water from the Celtic Sea, into the Irish Sea giving rise \nto an increase in sea level in the eastern Irish Sea, particularly in the Solway estuary and \nMorecambe Bay regions.  It is evident from Fig. 5a, that although sea level rises at the \nentrance to the Solway estuary, Morecambe Bay and the Mersey estuary, the storm surge has \nnot yet fully propagated into these shallow water regions.  In addition there is significant \nspatial variability in the storm surge elevation in these regions, reflecting local changes in \nbottom topography.  In the Heysham region situated at the southern end of Morecambe Bay \nthere is significant small scale variability in the surge produced by local topography.  As the \nsurge enters the region, \u201cwetting and drying\u201d can occur giving rise to short period oscillations \nin the surge elevation as shown at this time in Fig. 4c.  The magnitude and spatial variability \n 13 \nof the storm surge elevation in the eastern Irish Sea is consistent with that found in the high \nresolution 1 km local area model of JD98 (compare Fig. 5a, with Fig. 14a of JD98). \n Current vectors over the whole region (Fig. 6a(i)) show water flowing from the Celtic \nSea into the eastern Irish Sea in the region to the south of the isle of Man.  In addition some \nof the water that flows into the Irish Sea continues north along the east coast of Ireland, \nleaving the region through the North Channel.  To the north of the Isle of Man, water leaves \nthe eastern Irish Sea, and flows out through the North Channel.  The ability of the finite \nelement model to refine the mesh in regions such as the North Channel, where previous work \n(Davies et al 2001) required the nesting of a local high resolution model, is a significant \nadvantage over earlier work using regular finite difference grids.  In addition refining the \nmesh within the eastern Irish Sea allows more detail of the flow fields to be observed in the \nnearshore region (Fig. 6a(ii)).  It is evident from Fig. 6a(ii), that there is a significant increase \nin current intensity in the nearshore region, with currents flowing parallel to the coastal \nboundary.  As shown previously for the case of tidal residuals (Jones and Davies 2007c) \ncoastal irregularities produced by finite difference \u201cstair case\u201d effects can introduce spurious \neddies in near coastal regions.  Complex spatial variations are evident in the currents close to \nthe entrances to shallow water estuaries as can be seen in expanded plots of the Morecambe \nBay (Fig. 6a(iii)) and Liverpool Bay (Fig. 6a(iv)) regions.  At the entrance to Morecambe \nBay (Fig. 6a(iii)), namely at about 54.05N, -3.1W (close to Heysham) currents change from \n2.5 cm s-1 to over 12.5 cm s-1 over one element.  This suggests that to resolve exchange \nbetween these estuaries and the outside region, and within the estuaries fine mesh resolutions \nof the order of 50 m or less are required.  A similar complex distribution of currents is \nevident in the Liverpool Bay area at the entrance to the Mersey estuary.  This clearly shows \nthat although storm surge elevations may vary smoothly in space, the currents exhibit \n 14 \nsignificant small scale variability that must be taken into account in any measurement \nprogramme. \n Although the present model cannot take account of detailed topographic variations in \nthe Mersey estuary, since to be consistent with earlier finite difference work (JD98) the \ntopography in this region is taken from the 1 km grid of JD98, it is evident (Fig. 6a(v)) that \nthere is some spatial variability in the currents within the Mersey.  This suggests that to \nreproduce storm surge events at Liverpool a more accurate description of the Mersey such as \nthat used by Jones and Davies (2006) is required. \n In essence the surface elevation and current distributions shown in Figs. 5a and 6a, \nwere produced by south westerly winds.  However by 00hr 12\/Nov the wind direction \nchanged to one from the northwest.  This gave rise to a rapid increase in elevations in the \neastern Irish Sea (Fig. 5(b)), although elevations decreased in the Celtic Sea.  The alignment \nand distribution of elevation contours in the deep water regions (Fig. 5b) corresponds very \nclosely with those found in the coarse grid (7 km) model of DJ92 (compare Fig. 5b with Fig. \n6b in DJ92).  In the eastern Irish Sea, where the mesh is much finer, elevation contours are in \ngood agreement with the high resolution (1 km) model results of JD98 (compare Fig. 5b with \nFig. 14b in JD98). \n Current vectors at 00 hr 12\/Nov, reveal (Fig. 6b(i)) that unlike previously (Fig. 6a(i)) \nat this time there is an inflow of water into the Irish Sea through the North Channel, driven by \nthe winds from the northwest.  Some of this water flows due south in the deep region to the \nwest of the Isle of Man, whilst some water flows into the eastern Irish Sea in the region to the \nsouth of the Isle of Man.  An outflow from the eastern Irish Sea is evident to the north of the \nIsle of Man.  Associated with this inflow and outflow a current gyre develops in the eastern \nIrish Sea to the northwest of the Isle of Man (Fig. 6b(ii)).  As previously in coastal regions \n 15 \nthe flows are parallel to the coast, with intensity increasing very rapidly as the water \nshallows. \n In the Morecambe Bay region (Fig. 6b(iii)) there is less spatial variability in the \ncurrents than previously (Fig. 6a(iii)) with a flow to the north in the shallow regions, and an \nelevation gradient forced flow out of the bay in the deeper central channel.  Similarly in \nLiverpool Bay (Fig. 6b(iv)) there is a more spatially coherent directly wind forced flow (Fig. \n6b(iv)), although at the entrance to the Mersey and within it the current (Fig. 6b(v)) has \nsimilar spatial variability to that found previously (Fig. 6a(v)). \n As illustrated at 18hr 11\/Nov, although surge elevation contours show a uniform \ndistribution there is significant variability in the currents.  This current variability tends to \ndecrease at times of strong wind forcing due to the large scale wind which is spatially \ncoherent, setting the space scale, rather than local elevation gradients in nearshore regions \nwhich have a small space scale due to variation in topography.  However, as will be shown \nlater, in terms of flow away from coastal effects, where elevation gradients are more uniform, \nthe large scale pressure gradient forced flow is often spatially uniform. \n By 06hr 12\/Nov the wind\u2019s magnitude has decreased, although surge elevations in the \neastern Irish Sea remain significant (of order 30 cm) (Fig. 5c).  The presence of an \nappreciable west-east elevation gradient across the Irish Sea, comparable to that found in \nJD98 (compare Fig. 5c and Fig. 14c in JD98), and between the Irish Sea and the region \nbeyond (compare Fig. 5c with Fig. 6c in DJ92), drives water out of the eastern Irish Sea, both \nto the north and south of the Isle of Man (Fig. 6c(i)).  In addition in the north there is a net \noutflow from the Irish Sea, both through the North Channel and along the west coast of \nScotland.  A similar net outflow is evident in the south where water flows from the Irish Sea \nto the Celtic Sea.  At this time the wind field over the region is negligible, and hence the \nstorm surge elevation gradient that has developed over the region cannot be supported and \n 16 \nforces flow out of the eastern Irish Sea.  It is evident from Figs. 6c(i) and 6c(ii) that away \nfrom coastal boundary regions the spatial variability of this elevation pressure driven flow is \nappreciably less than that found at times of wind forcing.  However in some regions, notably \noff the northeast corner of the Isle of Man there is a bifurcation in the flow with some flow \ngoing to the north and another flow to the south, which leads to local small scale variability.  \nSimilarly in shallow coastal regions such as Morecambe Bay (expanded plot not shown) and \nthe entrance to the Mersey in Liverpool Bay (expanded plot not shown) there is some local \nsmall scale variability.  In particular in both these regions current vectors show a strong \noffshore and out of estuary flow in the deeper water.  Within the Mersey (expanded plot not \nshown) there is a near uniform outflow as sea surface elevations within the estuary decrease. \n Calculations showed that as the depression that produced the surge of 00hr 12\/Nov, \nmoved out of the region, surge elevations decreased to near zero.  However at 12hr 13\/Nov, \nwinds from the northwest moved over the region, and their intensity increased and their \ndirection changed to winds from the north over the following 18 hrs. \n By 12hr 14\/Nov these winds had produced a decrease in elevation to the south of \nIreland (Fig. 5d) with an increase in elevation to the north of Ireland and along the west coast \nof Scotland (Fig. 5d).  The magnitude and spatial distribution of elevation contours associated \nwith this wind event, computed with the finite element model over the west coast region (Fig. \n5d) correspond very closely with those computed with the coarser mesh 7 km finite \ndifference grid of DJ92 (compare Fig. 5d with Fig. 6d of DJ92).  Similarly in the near coastal \nregion of the eastern Irish Sea the computed surge elevation is in good agreement with that \ncomputed by JD98 using a limited area high resolution (1 km) model (compare Fig. 5d with \nFig. 14d of JD98).   \n As surface wind stresses over the region decreased and changed to a wind stress from \nthe north, the elevation gradient to the north of the North Channel could not be maintained \n 17 \nand water flowed from the west coast of Scotland region, through the North Channel and into \nthe Irish Sea (Fig. 6d(i)).  A significant proportion of this water flows south in the deep \nchannel to the west of the Isle of Man, with some water entering the eastern Irish Sea (Fig. \n6d(i)).  Within the eastern Irish Sea, as previously, away from the coastal boundary layer the \nflow field is fairly spatially uniform, although it changes rapidly in the region of estuaries \n(Fig. 6d(ii)).  Within estuaries, see for example Morecambe Bay there is appreciable small \nscale variability in the currents (expanded plot not shown), associated with changes in \ntopography.  Similarly at the entrance to the Mersey (expanded plot not shown) and within \nthe Mersey (expanded plot not shown) there is some spatial variability.  However, since the \nwind field at 12hr 14\/Nov has declined from its previous maximum value of 1 Pa (see JD98, \nfor details of wind stress), and the flow is mainly surface elevation gradient forced into the \nMersey from Liverpool Bay the distribution of current vectors in the Mersey is substantially \nsmoother than that found previously. \n The change in wind direction and increase in magnitude between 12h and 18h 14\/Nov \ngives rise to a positive surge in the eastern Irish Sea at 18hr 14\/Nov (Fig. 5e).  However the \nwinds from the north, namely offshore winds in the region to the south of Ireland produce a \nnegative surge of about 50 cm to the south of Ireland (Fig. 5e).  The location and magnitude \nof this negative surge and the distribution of elevation contours in the Celtic and Irish Sea \n(Fig. 5e) is in close agreement with that computed in DJ92 with the 7 km finite difference \ngrid (compare Fig. 5e, with Fig. 6e in DJ92).  Similarly in the eastern Irish Sea the rapid \nincrease in surge elevation as the coast is approached and the subsequent decrease within the \nestuaries corresponds to that computed by JD98 using the fine grid model of the region \n(compare Fig. 5e, with Fig. 14e in JD98). \n The influence of the strong wind from the north at this time (18h 14\/Nov) is to force \nwater from the west of Scotland, through the North Channel and into the Irish Sea (Fig. \n 18 \n6e(i)).  Within the Irish Sea, there is a flow to the south in the deep channel (Fig. 1) to the \nwest of the Isle of Man, that enters the Celtic Sea (Fig. 6e(i)).  Some of the water flowing \nthrough the Irish Sea, enters the eastern Irish Sea along the northern and southern coastal \nregions of the Isle of Man (Fig. 6e(i)).  Within the eastern Irish Sea there is significant spatial \nvariability in the currents (Fig. 6e(ii)), produced by a combination of local sea level rise along \nthe coast, which in Liverpool Bay produces an offshore flow, and wind forced flow from the \nIrish Sea entering the region.  In addition directly wind forced currents within the eastern \nIrish Sea contributed to this spatial variability.  The net effect of this combined forcing is to \nproduce a large current gyre to the east of the Isle of Man, and a number of near shore gyres \n(Fig. 6e(ii)).  Within Morecambe Bay (expanded plot not shown) there is significant spatial \nvariability in both current magnitude and direction due to variations in topography and the \ninterplay between local elevation gradient forced flow and that due to direct wind forcing. \nSimilarly in Liverpool Bay (expanded plot not shown) away from the nearshore \nregion there is a uniform offshore flow, however in the nearshore region a detailed \nexamination shows that the currents exhibit significant spatial variability.  Nevertheless \nwithin the Mersey estuary a more uniform distribution of currents is evident.  The uniform \nflow in the Mersey found in the present calculations primarily arises from a lack of resolution \nin this region.  This is due to the fact that in order to compare surge solutions derived with the \nfinite element model with those computed by JD98, identical topography was used within the \nMersey.  As shown by Jones and Davies (2006) for the case of the response of the Mersey to \nuniform wind forcing, when more detailed and accurate topography together with element \nsizes of order 50 m are used in the Mersey then a more complex spatial pattern arises.  \nHowever the whole region surge plots clearly show that there was significant spatial and \ntemporal variability in both the surge elevations and currents during the November 1977 \nstorm surge event.  This variability arises from time and space variations in the meteorology \n 19 \nand the significant changes in water depth over the region.  The existence of an accurate \nmeteorological data set for model forcing and coastal gauges for comparison makes it an \nideal period for testing models, and inter-comparing their performance. \nComparison with a previous coarse grid large area model (DJ92) and a high resolution \nlimited area Eastern Irish Sea model (JD98), showed that the finite element model with its \ngraded mesh could reproduce the large scale variability of the surge over the region.  In \naddition its finer mesh in the eastern Irish Sea could resolve the small scale variability of the \nsurge in this region. \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n An unstructured mesh finite element model of the sea region off the west coast of \nBritain has been used to model the storm surge event of November 1977.  This period was \nchosen because an accurate meteorological data set was available to drive the model and \ncoastal gauge data could be used to validate the model.  In addition the solution from a large \narea coarse grid (7 km) finite difference model covering an identical region, and a limited \narea (eastern Irish Sea) high (1 km) model was available for comparison.  By covering the \nsame area as the coarse grid model and using identical water depth distributions to those used \nin the coarse and high resolution limited area model, a valid comparison with earlier finite \ndifference solutions could be made, since all models used the same forcing. \n Calculations showed that the external component of the surge was significant at all \nlocations, although in the eastern Irish Sea, wind forcing, namely the internal surge was a \nmajor contributor.  Consequently in any storm surge simulation, the model had to accurately \npropagate the surge into the eastern Irish Sea and account for wind forcing in the region, and \nlocal changes in topography.  The finite element model with its ability to vary the mesh could \naccurately resolve narrow channels such as the North Channel (Figs. 1 and 3) where \npreviously nested high resolution models had been used (Davies et al 2001) and the nearshore \n 20 \nregion of the eastern Irish Sea.  This area had previously been modelled with a limited area \nhigh resolution (1 km) model (JD98). \n Time series of the storm surge elevations at ports in the eastern Irish Sea, showed that \nthe finite element model with its fine mesh in this region could reproduce surge elevations \nwith comparable accuracy to the 1 km model of JD98.  Similarly surface elevation contours \nboth within the eastern Irish Sea and the region beyond where the mesh was much coarser \ncould be reproduced by the model and were in close agreement with those computed in DJ92 \nand JD98.  By using the same region, open boundary and meteorological forcing together \nwith identical water depths showed that the solution was independent of the numerical \nmethod used to derive it (namely finite difference or finite element).  In addition the close \nagreement in the solutions showed that the finite element model with its irregular mesh, could \naccurately reproduce the storm surge propagation through the region and account for local \nchanges due to wind forcing and nearshore fine scale topography. \n Although the use of identical topography enabled a valid model inter-comparison to \nbe made, the use of a coarse representation of the nearshore region of Liverpool Bay and the \nMersey as in JD98, meant that the storm surge was not accurately resolved in this region.  \nThe importance of high resolution in the Mersey in resolving details of the wind induced flow \nin this area has recently been reported by Jones and Davies (2006) for the case of uniform \nsteady wind forcing.  This suggests that in any future calculations of storm forced flow in the \nLiverpool Bay and Mersey estuary, an enhanced mesh refinement in this region as in Jones \nand Davies (2006) is required.  This effect of such a mesh enhancement on storm surges is \ncurrently being investigated. \n Certainly the ability of the finite element model to refine the mesh in regions of \nrapidly changing topography where high resolution and accuracy is required (e.g. the \nnearshore region or within an estuary) is a major advantage over the nested finite difference \n 21 \napproach used previously (JD98, Davies et al 2001).  As shown here, at the entrance to many \nestuaries, there is significant spatial variability in the flow, suggesting that nesting a fine \nmesh finite difference model of an estuary within a larger model would be very difficult.  As \nshown by Davies and Hall (2002), nesting a local area model within a coarser model in \nregions of rapidly varying flow can significantly influence and sometimes reverse the flow in \nthe limited area model. \n These calculations suggest that the use of an unstructured mesh model with a \nprogressively finer grid in the nearshore region should improve storm surge prediction, \nprovided detailed and accurate bottom topography is available in these areas.  However, as \nthe mesh is refined, other processes such as wave-current interaction (Davies and Lawrence \n1995, Jones and Davies 2001) and the three dimensional nature of the flow become important \n(JD98) and may need to be considered, in order to significantly improve storm surge \nprediction in an irregular mesh model. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n The origin of the TELEMAC system is EDF-LNHE and is therefore \u00a9EDF-LNHE.  \nThe authors are indebted to R.A.
