However, to date much of this work has\u2014\nunderstandably\u2014focused on the pedagogical design and best practice elements of\nsuch use, particularly with regard to promoting student engagement. Less attention\nappears to have been devoted to what pedagogical enhancements we, as educators,\ncan achieve from the insights into students\u2019 problem-solving and thinking processes\nafforded by the monitoring and analysis of online interactions.\nUnderpinning our explorations of the uses of the virtual learning environment\n(VLE) was an enthusiasm to find out what e-learning would enable us to do that we\n*Corresponding author.

Cooke\ncould not readily achieve before\u2014or at the very least, what it would enable us to do\nmore effectively than was previously possible. We were less interested in using the\nVLE in an attempt simply to mimic offline experience (Garrison & Anderson, 2003).\nIn particular, we were hoping that the adoption of a blended learning approach\n(Thorne, 2003) would offer new opportunities to: \n\u25cf improve the efficiency of course delivery;\n\u25cf enhance the student learning experience; and\n\u25cf extend the learning opportunities of the student.\nWe refer to this concept as the e3 model to capture the essence of the three aims.\nThe theoretical framework that guided our use of the VLE was that of the social-\nconstructivist (or collaborative-constructivist) perspective, placing the role of\ncommunication and interaction at the heart of education. This perspective favours\nthe Vygotskian approach of enabling the construction of meaning and knowledge\nthrough shared dialogue and discourse and the confirmation of understanding\nthrough mutual sharing and testing of ideas in a collaborative environment (Mason,\n1996; Harland, 2003). In particular, we aimed to create a learning environment that\nempowered students and encouraged them to become more independent and auton-\nomous with regard to their own learning\u2014in effect, using technology to create a\nvirtual \u2018Autonomous Learning Zone\u2019 (Hughes, 2003).\nIn its ideal form, this supportive environment would offer a virtual form of\nLipman\u2019s \u2018community of enquiry\u2019, where: \n\u2026 students listen to one another with respect, build on one another\u2019s ideas, challenge one\nanother to supply reasons for otherwise unsupported opinions, assist each other in draw-\ning inferences from what has been said, and seek to identify one another\u2019s assumptions.\n(1991, p. 15)\nAnalysis of interactions on the student discussion forums suggested that the students\ndid, indeed, form such supportive \u2018communities of enquiry\u2019. However, we believe that\nan additional benefit from the use and analysis of these forums has been the oppor-\ntunity opened up to us to enhance our own practice through a better understanding of\nstudents\u2019 problem-solving processes and from an insight into their own \u2018reflection-in-\naction\u2019 (Sch\u00f6n, 1982). This is of crucial importance in a context where, it has been\nsuggested, it is not uncommon for academics engaged in teaching students to focus on\nsession content during teaching rather than on student learning (Fry et al., 2003). It\nis surely not unreasonable to assume that the more we can know about student learning\nprocesses, the better we are likely to be able to teach. The current study provides some\nideas about this process of learning about students\u2019 learning, focusing on how we can\nharness the power of collaborative communication tools to improve this knowledge.\nMethodology\nThe research approach is exploratory. We were interested in extending and evaluating\nthe opportunities offered by use of the VLE; the quality of the insights into the\nOnline group communication and collaboration 263\nproblem-solving and student learning processes that were gained were not initially\nanticipated. The research strategy involved the use of two case studies, the contexts\nfor which were selected in part on the grounds of their suitability as a test-site for\ntheory (Yin, 1994) and in part on a pragmatic basis in terms of access to data.\nAlthough it is recognised that such an approach does not provide a strong basis for\ngeneralisation, we subscribe to Denscombe\u2019s view of its utility for small-scale research\nwhere \u2018\u2026 there may be insights to be gained from looking at the individual case that\ncan have wider implications \u2026 The aim is to illuminate the general by looking at the\nparticular\u2019 (Denscombe, 2003, p. 30). This approach also enabled us to investigate a\n\u2018naturally occurring phenomenon\u2019 (Yin, 1994) within its own setting, with minimal\nrisk of the occurrence of artificially induced findings.\nThe method adopted for data collection and analysis involved monitoring the\nsubgroup discussion threads and analysing the content to identify the \u2018thinking\u2019\nprocess that was taking place at that time. This was achieved by manually scanning\nthe texts for natural language \u2018thinking indicators\u2019, to illuminate the underlying prob-\nlem-solving process in which the students were engaged. These \u2018thinking indicators\u2019\nall illustrate an aspect of the benefits from using this window into student learning to\nsteer our own practice and interaction with our students.\nBy \u2018thinking indicators\u2019 we mean online \u2018speech\u2019 that suggests an underlying cogni-\ntive problem-solving process is taking place. This is represented by words or phrases\nsuch as \u2018I think \u2026\u2019 or \u2018on reflection \u2026\u2019, along with requests for explanation or confir-\nmation of thoughts suggested by terms such as \u2018do you think \u2026?\u2019 or \u2018how do you feel\nabout \u2026?\u2019 Although these words and phrases may not provide conclusive evidence of\na cognitive process, they can act as a \u2018hook\u2019 that highlights the potential existence of\na learning \u2018window\u2019.\nThe text of all of the discussion content from each group in the two student cohorts\nwas scanned. Those excerpts reproduced in this paper represent only those that we\nconsidered to be particularly illustrative of the concept of the Window into Learning.\nThese indicate notions such as the identification of an appropriate point to steer the\ngroup away from going down a \u2018blind alley\u2019; the benefit to students of a \u2018safe house\u2019\nin which to test their ideas; and the ability to gain an insight into changing students\u2019\nthinking. In the excerpts presented here, underlining has been added by the authors\nto emphasise specific concepts, and commentary follows each extract. The insights\nprovided through this exercise were supplemented by analysis of comments relating\nto the use of the discussion boards found within the text of City University students\u2019\nwritten reflections on the process of completing the group task.\nCase study one context\u2014a problem-based experiential learning approach\nThe first study took place within the Department of Computing and IT at\nBuckinghamshire Chilterns University College. In 2002\/03, the institution\nembarked upon a phased implementation of the Blackboard VLE for use by staff\nand students in a blended learning context. A particularly effective element of the\nimplementation strategy was the parallel introduction of faculty-based Teaching\n264 R. E. J. Jones and L. Cooke\nFellows, who were instrumental in championing the cause of the VLE, in supporting\nfaculty staff in their use of the technology, in disseminating good pedagogical prac-\ntice across the institution and in developing imaginative and innovative approaches\nto the use of the VLE.\nThe case study is based on one such innovative approach by a Senior Teaching\nFellow in the Faculty of Technology. This innovation adopted a Problem-Based\nExperiential Learning approach (the \u2018Design Studio\u2019), intended to facilitate collabo-\nration and deep learning among M.Sc. Information Technology students. The course\ninvolved a mix of part-time and full-time students studying the design, modelling and\nimplementation of complex software artefacts. The use of the \u2018Design Studio\u2019\napproach was premised on the belief that the development of critical thinking and\nproblem-solving capabilities can facilitate a higher cognitive level of thought process.\nIt was also intended to offer a means of illustrating and capturing best practice as\ndemonstrated in the software industry, which operates in a field characterised by\nrapid, in-depth change and adaptation in the methodologies used to produce modern\nsoftware.\nUsing the \u2018Design Studio\u2019 approach, students are faced with a large, complex soft-\nware design problem, centred on a real-life activity, which must be taken to comple-\ntion, even if this is only as a prototype artefact. In this instance, the specific task that\nstudents were required to accomplish was to produce software for an airline reserva-\ntion system. Students work in groups of approximately four as independent teams\nreporting back each week in an iterative, staged process. These processes are assessed\nat each stage through presentation of their progress and subsequent review of submit-\nted work. It was hoped that use of the Blackboard group communication tools would\nassist these group processes by encouraging students to support each other in a virtual\ncommunity based on communication and collaboration\u2014they could use interaction\nand feedback from others to help them determine the accuracy and application of\ntheir own ideas, thus providing an \u2018empowering mutual learning experience\u2019 (Palloff\n& Pratt, 1999, p. 18) that would engender a Gestalt effect in the output of the group\n(\u2018Gestalt\u2019 used here in the synergistic sense of the whole being more than the sum of\nthe parts). The module tutor\u2019s intervention in the group communication was\nrestricted in the main to technical guidance when required or requested.\nThe problem-based learning approach of the Design Studio represents an itera-\ntive process that incorporates conceptual stages that can be used sequentially, or\nmore powerfully, in parallel. These stages comprise the following (Garrison &\nAnderson, 2003): \n\u25cf Triggering event or problem.\n\u25cf Exploration\u2014divergence, information exchange, suggestions, brainstorming, intui-\ntive leaps.\n\u25cf Integration\u2014convergence, synthesis, solutions.\n\u25cf Resolution\u2014apply, test, defend.\nBy using the Blackboard group communication tools it was anticipated that these\nstages could take place within an environment that offered students a suitable space\nOnline group communication and collaboration 265\nfor reflection, and, most importantly, a \u2018safe house\u2019 in which to air opinions, confi-\ndent that their contributions were restricted to a closed egalitarian community.\nCase study two context\u2014a group-based research and presentation task\nThe second case study draws on the experience of using group discussion boards at\nCity University, with WebCT as the software platform. The use of WebCT at the\nuniversity was pioneered within the Department of Information Science, and since\nthe start of the academic year 2003\/04 the VLE has been rolled out across the univer-\nsity. Currently about 400 modules university-wide use WebCT to provide online\ncontent, support and communication, in a combination of blended, flexible and\ndistant learning modes. This particular case study illustrates use of the group online\ncollaboration tools to complete the research and preparation for a face-to-face group\npresentation task by full-time and part-time M.Sc. Information Science and M.Sc.\nLibrary and Information Studies students in a blended learning context.\nIn this case, students taking a module on Libraries and Publishing in the Informa-\ntion Society were asked to work in groups of four, using the group \u2018sign-up\u2019 sheets\noffered on WebCT to self-select their own groups. They were challenged to analyse\nthe current state of the information sector and factors impacting on information flows\nand access to information within a country of their choice\u2014taking account of consid-\nerations such as political and economic context, legislation, demographics, geogra-\nphy, historical and cultural background, and technological infrastructure. They used\nthe group discussion boards to communicate and to coordinate their work. Tutor\nintervention in these discussions was in line with that in the previous case study. In\naddition to presenting their findings to the whole group, the students were required\nto produce a written reflection on their learning from carrying out the task.\nThe pedagogical intentions behind this particular assignment were shaped by the\nimportance of students developing a high level of professional skills in areas such as\nindependent research, team-working, critical analysis, time management and presen-\ntation skills. This need has been much emphasised within the discipline area by\nemployers and professional bodies alike (Martin, 1989; McAllister & Alexander,\n2003, 285\u2013286; CILIP, 2004; Gorman, 2004) and is embedded within the disciplin-\nary benchmark statement (Quality Assurance Agency, 2000). The assignment was\nalso intended to encourage a reflective value-critical approach, both to students\u2019 own\nprofessional practice and to the wider professional context in which they will be work-\ning. The use of group work also offered a means of transcending some of the fragmen-\ntation that students themselves had identified as a result of the inevitable loss of a\n\u2018course identity\u2019 within the context of a modular programme.\nEthical issues in the research strategy\nIt should be noted that the permission of students to analyse and use their contribu-\ntions in this way was obtained, and all contributions are anonymised. Only the text of\ndiscussion contributions is included in the following analysis; headers have been\n266 R. E. J. Jones and L. Cooke\nomitted in order to ensure full anonymity. For the same reason, any names used in\nthe body of the text have been changed.\nWith regard to the written reflections, the assignments of any students who did not\nexplicitly give permission to have their work used in this way were excluded from the\nanalysis.\nResults\nThe results for the two case studies have been grouped thematically and presented in\nan integrated format to emphasise the portrayal of common concepts and themes.\nThe examples given are quoted verbatim (apart from anonymisation) to give an accu-\nrate insight into the actual student dialogue, and are followed by our comments.\nWithin categories, the examples from the M.Sc. Information Technology students are\npresented first, continuing with those from the M.Sc. Information Science and M.Sc.\nLibrary and Information Studies students.\nStudent thinking processes and tutor intervention\u2014designing an airline reservations software \nsystem\nThis echoes my own thoughts. Given that we are using a \u2018Design Studio\u2019 process to\ndevelop the application (OOImp) and that we have considered web based development \u2026\ntogether with DE\u2019s Databases and we know how to design a system \u2026 perhaps we should\nput this all together to suggest a totally web based system? i.e. front office apps such as the\npublic web interface as well as back office solutions that would be suggested by a distrib-\nuted system supported by a database (??)\nThis example indicates a \u2018thinking aloud\u2019 comment by the student, reflecting on their\napproach to solving the specific design problem. In this instance, the tutor was able\nto steer the group away from wasting time on pursuing a web-based application,\nwhich was not the intended outcome for this assignment. The response to this posting\nfrom another group member illustrates the evolving problem solution process in\naction: \nI would suggest that the first step would be to reclarify the purpose statement to include\nGraham\u2019s alterations, then to elaborate on the features to discover what are the features\nthat should be on offer to the three groups of system users (if one adopts the above) i.e.\nsystem managers\u2014set-up type operations; RIC users\u2014day to day transactions from RIC\u2019s\nperspective; and finally RIC\u2019s clients\u2014online reservations and enquiries.\nThis hints at a first cut, use case diagram.\nThis new \u2018confidential thread\u2019 seems to work.\nIn addition to the insight offered into the problem-solving process, the final\ncomment in this excerpt suggests that the \u2018safe house\u2019 concept of the sub-group\n(\u2018confidential thread\u2019) is beneficial. \n\u2026 In light of our First stage and comments I have altered my thinking slightly, it occurs to\nme that possibly a high percentage of charter airlines (as per our remit) would probably\nOnline group communication and collaboration 267\nhave some form of WWW reservation\/advertising. Whilst the advertising part is outside the\nremit the reservation part is not. Should we therefore now give more consideration to a\nWWW based interface? Or is it too early at this stage?\nIn this excerpt, we can see the dynamic nature of the thought processes as the student\nreflects on contributions from other group members. It provides an insight into the\nstudent\u2019s current thinking with regard to the problem solution, and, in this instance,\nagain afforded an opportunity for the tutor to intervene with regard to the appropri-\nateness of the proposed web-based solution. \nI get the impression that you would like transactions when it comes to processing the reser-\nvations side or have I gone too far yet again? My thoughts being a ReservationTransaction\nobject from the ReservationTransaction class is created to store the reservation as it is\n\u2018built\/created\u2019 which can then be committed to the Reservation object and the Reserva-\ntionTransaction object is destroyed\u2014all of which adds a lot of interesting complexity to\nthe sequence diagram which may be me going over the top \u2026\nSecondly I want a selection in the change reservation sequence diagram (i.e. choose the\npart of the reservation that needs altering) and I have forgotten how it is done. Any point-\ners (www) would be appreciated if there is time. The alternative is 3 individual sequence\ndiagrams.\nHere, the student seems to be developing the concept of a topic (Reservation-\nTransaction) for him\/herself and the text gives an insight into their thought process.\nAlso, the link into other subjects could be picked up by their colleagues to form asso-\nciations that help enrich the learning experience of the students.\nStudent thinking processes and tutor intervention\u2014analysing the global Information Society\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the education bit\u2014such a vast subject. To narrow it down I\nthought to take it to a more basic level.\nTo do that I asked myself what was most fundamental to all information. The obvious\nanswer is of course reading and writing\u2014literacy, literate, illiterate \u2026\nSo my focus is Literacy from an Australian perspective.\nIn a very different context from the previous examples, this \u2018thinking aloud\u2019 excerpt\nnonetheless gives a similar insight into the thought processes that led to a particular\ndecision or outcome. The group had chosen to research the Information Society in\nAustralia and it had been decided that this group member would investigate \u2018educa-\ntion\u2019. The discussion board helps the tutor\u2014and other group members\u2014to under-\nstand why the student chose a particular focus for analysis. \nAs the idea was to discuss the ppt itself, we\u2019re doing well. I do agree a minimum of slides\nis important. I think not more than 6\u20137 in total \u2026 I\u2019ve also been thinking that everything\non the ppt should have a comparison or analysis, not merely be a pointer to what we will\ntalk about next. We need to get the audience thinking about the subject\u2014perhaps we could\nput questions up then supply the answer etc. \u2026 or leading statements.\n268 R. E. J. Jones and L. Cooke\nAn interesting\u2014and unexpected\u2014outcome of this particular assignment was the\ninsight gained into students\u2019 pedagogic awareness, and the attention they gave to this\naspect of the task. Here it can be seen that they are thinking about how to engage their\naudience actively with the presentation content. There were a number of such exam-\nples: a couple of these are now offered as further illustration. \nAnimation wise, best not to do too much as takes away from content, but we can add a\nfew cool things in, like the pictures swishing in from the side or something, just to add a\nbit of life to it.\nWhat do you reckon?\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to time yourselves reading\u20143 mins per bit.\nI find it\u2019s best to write it exactly as it is spoken and to simplify any sentences that create\nstumbling blocks\u2014what looks great to read isn\u2019t necessarily easy to speak.\nkeep practising and revising the words until you find the natural flow.\nDeveloping a \u2018community of enquiry\u2019 and contribution audit trail\u2014designing an airline \nreservations software system\nIn the reply to this post, i thought about the answers to the questions and came up with\nthese answers\nRIC must be running scheduled flights and even if it does not run scheduled flights at\npresent, it is important to have the system support this for future growth.\nFreight services is something i did not include when thinking of the system, but i think i\nwould like to include that option as well, which may be useful.\nAbout hiring the plane, it is not something unique and does need to be included and it may\nbe that RIC also offers planes for hire to other charter companies.\nI think it can be made a point to add this to the system as sub functions under main cate-\ngories which we have identified.\nYour comments on this will be appreciated.\nThis is an interesting example, as this particular student was not forthcoming in the\nface-to-face sessions, due to a lack of confidence in spoken English, but was willing\nto put ideas forward via the discussion board. This gave the tutor the opportunity to\nmonitor their unique original contribution. The student actively engages in the\n\u2018Community of Enquiry\u2019 in a virtual culture, presumably due to a sense of security\nprovided by the relatively private nature of the medium. \nI agree with removing the create passenger details form. I didn\u2019t particularly like this term\neither, I originally had \u2018enter flight schedule\u2019. But didn\u2019t know if this was too simple or too\nobvious!! I can\u2019t see the difference between flight schedule and scheduling data, surely a\nflight schedule is made up of scheduling data once you\u2019ve entered the data you have the\nschedule? A flight timetable includes the plane, the time, the destination?\nA further example of the \u2018Community of Enquiry\u2019 where the students are engaging\neach other, and the contribution trail can be audited and attributed accurately.\nOnline group communication and collaboration 269\nDeveloping a \u2018community of enquiry\u2019 and contribution audit trail\u2014analysing the global \nInformation Society\nThoughts re demographic and geography: how do you perceive the demogr bit? Shall I do\na rundown of stats or do you think it\u2019s more about how the demograp affects the info flow?\nI was thinking the latter, but with only 3 minutes, it seems a little contrived to analyse in\nso short a space without making huge assumptions, i.e.: info flow increased with younger,\ncomputer literate age groups and amongst non-indigenous peoples. This seems more\ntheory based than analysis\u2014is this right?\nre geog bit, I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s more about how location (urban, rural, outback) effects\ninfo flow for the communities than detailing the overall geog of Australia\u2014do you think\nthis is right?\nThere seems to be several ways we can go with this, and it\u2019s important that we\u2019re all think-\ning the same way to make the overall presentation show cohesion, especially when it comes\nto linking the factors.\nWould appreciate feedback so know I\u2019m on right track and if you guys have quns re your\nbits too, let everyone else know.\nIn this excerpt, it can be seen that the student is consistently seeking feedback from\nher peers on her own ideas and suggestions. She is keen to engage them and draw\nthem in to put forward their own ideas, as can be seen in the final sentence. From a\ntutor\u2019s point of view, this affords a good insight into some of the dynamics of this\ngroup, as well as giving a context for the direction they subsequently took in their\nwork. \nI have found a good resource that I think would be of use to 3 of us www.abs.gov.au\nthis is the Australian Bureau of Statistics and lists various stats relating to demographics,\nsocial changes, education (sorry, no law stuff!).\nIt benefits from being an official government site, this gives it authority\/veracity and also\nshows how the country sees itself. It isn\u2019t biased but concentrates on those things impor-\ntant to the country (does that make sense?).\nThis excerpt has been included because it is a good example (among many that could\nhave been used) to illustrate students using the group boards to share knowledge and\nresources. In addition, it gives the tutor an indication of individual contributions, as\nwell as an insight into the evaluation process that the student has undertaken in select-\ning this particular resource\u2014a process that would not previously have been transpar-\nent to the tutor. And once again, we see the student using the discussion board as a\nmeans of seeking reassurance of their own understanding. \nI love a debate \u2026\nI agree with nearly everything you say \u2026, but don\u2019t really see how one muddies the other.\nI\u2019m saying it is not clear whether ethnicity is an issue because there are other social factors\nthat affect the indigenous population\u2019s ability, rights whatever, to the internet.\nNot all minority groups are disadvantaged and ethnicity is not an issue as it includes the\n90% caucasian.\n270 R. E. J. Jones and L. Cooke\nSurely pigeonholing a minority by explaining that the reason things happen to them is\nbecause of their race and not their circumstances, perpetuates the notion that it is accept-\nable to do so and hides the social responsibility that Australia has towards them \u2026\nThis was part of a lengthy discussion between two members of one group, who\ndisagreed on the role and importance of ethnicity as a barrier to Internet use. Without\naccess to the discussion board, the tutor would not have been aware of this debate,\nnor of the high-level of mature intellectual argument that was used by participants.\nThe visible \u2018end product\u2019 would simply have been the omission in their presentation\nof ethnicity in their discussion of barriers to access, which was the final outcome of\ntheir deliberations.\nStudent reflections\nAsking students to reflect on the group presentation process as part of their assessed\ntask for the Libraries and Publishing in the Information Society module provoked\nunexpectedly deep and open reflections on the group processes. It also provided the\ntutor with a qualitatively different insight into the students\u2019 experience of using the\ngroup discussion boards than could be obtained from analysis of discussion content\nalone. For example, a student who had appeared to engage happily and successfully\nwith the presentation task and with their group\u2019s discussion board made the following\ncomments: \nI think the presentation would have been more polished if we had actually been able to\nmeet up. It is a huge trial of patience to be restricted by the limitations of email and discus-\nsion boards, as posting an idea, opinion, or question does not guarantee an immediate\nresponse. Waiting for answers ultimately wasted time that would have been better spent\nfine-tuning the presentation. However, this is probably just reflective of my ardent atten-\ntion to detail and perfectionist attitude, the end result, after all, achieved its objectives.\nOverall, I would say that I have found this whole process utterly absorbing, not just for the\nresearch undertaken, but for the introspective examination it has provoked. I have discov-\nered that despite my natural inclination towards detail and exactness, I am able to relin-\nquish some control. Looking back, I can appreciate the team effort put into our\npresentation and am very proud of the outcome.\nThe value for the tutor of the discussion board as a contribution audit trail was rein-\nforced by comments in the students\u2019 reflections: where issues of non-contribution\nwere discussed, it was found that this state of affairs was reflected in the level of\ncontributions made to the discussion boards. \n\u2026 by making use of the dedicated area on the discussion boards, we could post our initial\nthoughts and provide easy access to them for the whole group. The boards became very\nuseful for this work, in that we could \u2018float\u2019 potential ideas between ourselves and also let\neach other know where we had got to in our individual research. Where group members\nare so geographically removed from each other and may only be in university once or twice\na week, the discussion boards are a welcome virtual meeting place. However, they are limited\nby the fact that they only work where all members are willing to contribute and engage with\nthe assignment\u2014if a group member chooses not to access the boards (as happened with our\nteam) then unfortunately there is little the others can do to maintain the balance.\nOnline group communication and collaboration 271\nIn this instance, a \u2018triangulation process\u2019\u2014involving monitoring of contributions to\nthe discussion board, monitoring of individual students\u2019 access to the VLE, analysis\nof the students\u2019 own reflections (including those of the \u2018non-player\u2019), and discussion\nbetween the tutor and the whole group\u2014confirmed that one student had not played\na full role in the preparation of the group\u2019s presentation. It was therefore possible to\nuse this evidence as a basis for moderating the marks awarded to the individual group\nmembers to reflect this imbalance. \nThe action plan posted on the discussion board \u2026 helped the group focus more specifically on each\nallotted task and was constructive in piecing the presentation together. Communication via the\ndiscussion boards was useful too, as the postings helped thought processes by making them explicit.\nThis is a particularly interesting excerpt, with the student spontaneously noting\nthat posting on the discussion board \u2018helped thought processes by making them\nexplicit\u2019. This relates back to the \u2018thinking aloud\u2019 notion, with the concomitant bene-\nfit that other group members and the tutor were also able to learn from these thought\nprocesses.\nDiscussion\nA window into learning\nWhile the established benefits for students of using discussion boards had been antic-\nipated, there were additional opportunities presented to tutors as a result of the\ngroups\u2019 use of the VLE. One of the most interesting of these opportunities is the one\nthat we have termed \u2018a window into learning\u2019. This refers to the ability that the use of\ngroup communication tools offered to audit at a much finer level the problem-solving\nprocess in which students engaged, it provided an insight into how they solved prob-\nlems, rather than focusing solely on the end product of the process (Kolb, 1984). It\nbecame more pragmatic to devote time and effort to the individual\u2019s learning of the\nsubject, rather than looking at the competence of their output as an indicator of their\nlearning. For subjects that are about problem-solving, analysis and design, the\nmanner of the problem-solving can be quite ethereal; the VLE afforded an opportu-\nnity to take a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of this rich and dynamic process. It also became possible to\ngain an enhanced understanding of the group dynamics that contributed towards the\nfinal outcome.\nFurthermore, observation of this process enabled tutors to intervene to adapt the\nteaching and learning environment in a timely manner. Rather than waiting for the\nnext contact session, or worse still a terminal assessment point, it became possible to\nprovide students with more effective and timely feedback and guidance.\nAt both institutions, many of the students played an active part in the general\ndiscussion board, as well as providing information for the module resource area.\nHowever, at both institutions it was when the mini-groups were established for\nprivate discussion, group communications and file transfer that students\u2019 use of the\nVLE increased significantly. In addition, there was an increase in the \u2018quality\u2019 of the\ninteraction, leading to the \u2018window into learning\u2019 approach being identified and\n272 R. E. J. Jones and L. Cooke\nfurther developed. Overall, the efficiency and effectiveness of both modules appeared\nto be greatly improved through the use of the VLE. For tutors, by far the most impor-\ntant benefit was the rich source of data offered through this window, from which we\nwere able to glean in-depth information into how the students were engaging in the\nproblem-solving process.\nLimitations of the research\nThe authors recognise the limitations imposed by the scale and the size of the samples\nfor the research. This study involved two cohorts of around 20 students each, from\ntwo separate\u2014and very different\u2014institutions and subject areas. Although the\nfindings from each context supported the notion of the Window into Learning, it is\nrecognised that it would be useful to test this concept more fully in a wider range of\nenvironments and that a more exhaustive study would be warranted. Nevertheless,\nwe believe that this research has shown that the potential benefits to be achieved\nexemplify the value of this form of content analysis of discussion threads.\nWith regard to reflections on what might be done differently in future, the following\nare of prime importance: \n\u25cf Capture the early enthusiasm for participation in the interaction using the concept\nof \u2018private mini-groups\u2019 earlier in the teaching and learning process.\n\u25cf Make more thorough notes of the interactions to inform enhancements and modi-\nfications to subsequent teaching sessions.\n\u25cf Consider rewarding student participation and the quality of their contributions via\nthe award of credits.\nAs far as students are concerned, we must work hard to ensure that students feel\nsecure in the \u2018safe house\u2019 of the learning environment, and that they gain \u2018achieve-\nment reward\u2019 to encourage them to participate in the full use of the VLE. Students\nhesitant in using the technology, or lacking confidence in posting their views on the\ndiscussion boards, will need extra support, encouragement and guidance.\nFuture directions\nThe potential for further evidence-based research into the use of online collaborative\ncommunication tools to enhance student learning opens up new possibilities for\ninvestigation into areas such as learning networks, learning objects and learning\nagents systems. Coupled with this is the possibility to automate the text scanning\nprocess in order to extract the required information more efficiently. Exploring the\npossibility of using artificial intelligence techniques within the \u2018restricted\u2019 context of\nthe discussions might prove a beneficial avenue to follow. Evaluation of the usefulness\nof existing content analysis software such as Nvivo, and the like, for this kind of anal-\nysis of forum content would also be beneficial. Such work might utilise the problem-\nbased learning cycle four-stages approach, as described earlier, for an analytical\nframework. The development of a scale of quantifiable measures, or benchmarks, to\nOnline group communication and collaboration 273\nevaluate the impact of the use of technology in enhancing the learning process also\ndeserves attention.\nConclusions\nThe development of the concept of \u2018a window into learning\u2019 has been an iterative\napproach that identified a beneficial outcome for students and academic staff of the\ncollaborative use of a VLE. We believe that this concept makes a contribution to our\nunderstanding of the potential of online discussion forums. The evidence to date\nsuggests to us that this \u2018window into learning\u2019 offers an important insight into student\nproblem-solving processes, giving us the potential to bring about a richer, qualita-\ntively enhanced, autonomous learning environment for the student and enabling us\nto achieve the aims of efficiency, enhancement and extension represented by the e3\nmodel.\nTaking the wider perspective, if the full potential offered by the use of the VLE is\nto be realised, the role of the tutor will need to adapt. In particular, there will be a\nneed to focus sufficient time on assimilating the qualitative information offered by the\nwindow on student interactions. It is envisaged that the enhanced information on the\nstudents\u2019 understanding of the topic will allow for more customised seminar and tuto-\nrial work to be set, together with more appropriate assessment tasks. However, this\naspect will need further investigation to provide more reliable approaches that can\nhelp to maximise the role of the tutor without overburdening them.\nWe believe the Window into Learning is an exciting concept that we have only just\nbegun to explore. The potential for further investigation into how we\u2014and ulti-\nmately, our students\u2014can benefit from the insights gained from opening up this\nwindow is considerable.\nReferences\nBeatty, K. & Nunan, D.
