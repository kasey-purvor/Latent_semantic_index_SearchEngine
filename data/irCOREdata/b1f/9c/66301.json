F. Griffin, K. J. Weatherill, S. G. MacLeod, R. M. Potvliege, and C. S. Adams\nDepartment of Physics, University of Durham, Rochester Building, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, England.\n(Dated: February 2, 2008)\nWe report on a method of light\u2013shift engineering where an auxiliary laser is used to tune the\natomic transition frequency. The technique is used to selectively load a specific region of an optical\nlattice. The results are explained by calculating the differential light\u2013shift of each hyperfine state.\nWe conclude that the remarkable spatial selectivity of light\u2013shift engineering using an auxiliary laser\nprovides a powerful technique to prepare ultra-cold trapped atoms for experiments on quantum gases\nand quantum information processing.\nPACS numbers: 39.25.+k, 31.10.+z, 32.60.+i, 03.67.-a, 03.75.-b, 42.62.-b\nOptical dipole traps and optical lattices are finding an\never increasing range of applications in experiments on\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [1, 2, 3, 4], optical\nclocks [5], single\u2013atom manipulation [6, 7], and quantum\ninformation processing (QIP) [8, 9]. In many applica-\ntions, one is interested not only in the light\u2013shift of the\nground state, which determines the trap depth, but also\nthe relative shift of a particular excited state. One has\nsome control over this differential shift as the ground and\nexcited states have different resonances, and the laser\ncan be tuned to a \u2018magic\u2019 wavelength where the ground\nand excited state polarizabilities are the same [5, 7, 10].\nHowever, using a \u2018magic\u2019 wavelength is not always ap-\npropriate either because one is no longer free to select\nthe laser wavelength to minimize spontaneous emission,\nor because of the unavailability of suitable light sources.\nIn this paper, we report on a different method of light\u2013\nshift engineering where a second laser field is used to con-\ntrol the excited state polarizability. One such method\nfor controlling ground\u2013state hyperfine polarizabilities is\ndiscussed in Ref. [11]. Light\u2013shift engineering using an\nindependent laser could have significant advantages over\nthe use of a \u2018magic\u2019 wavelength for some applications,\nas it can be applied to specific regions of a trap. For\nexample, we show how the technique can be used to se-\nlectively load a well defined region of an optical lattice.\nSpecifically, we consider the case of loading 85Rb atoms\ninto a deep CO2 laser lattice. A quasi-electrostatic lattice\nbased on a CO2 laser (wavelength 10.6 \u00b5m) is particu-\nlary attractive for trapping cold atoms or molecules as\nit combines low light scattering [12] with a lattice con-\nstant sufficiently large to allow single-site addressability\n[13]. We show that by focussing an additional laser (a\nNd:YAG laser with wavelength 1.064 \u00b5m) on a specific\nregion of the lattice we can selectively load only into sites\nin this region. This spatially selective loading is most ef-\nfective when the cooling light is blue\u2013detuned relative\nto the unperturbed atomic resonance. We explain the\neffect by calculating the differential light-shifts between\nthe ground and excited states in the presence of two light\nfields. We show that only in the light\u2013shift engineered re-\ngion where the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams overlap, is\nthe differential shift negative allowing efficient laser cool-\ning. In addition, we show that for red-detuned cooling\nlight, light\u2013shift engineering produces a significant en-\nhancement in the number of atoms loaded into a deep\noptical trap.\nThe experimental set-up employed to demonstrate con-\ntrolled loading by light\u2013shift engineering is shown in\nFig. 1. An octagonal vacuum chamber, fitted with\nhome-made Zinc Selenide (ZnSe) UHV viewports [14]\nto accommodate the CO2 laser beams, provides a back-\nground pressure of 1.2\u00d710\u221210 Torr. A focussed Nd:YAG\nlaser beam, with variable power, locally heats an alkali\nmetal dispenser to provide a controllable source of ther-\nmal 85Rb atoms [15]. A CO2 laser beam, (propagat-\ning along the z\u2013axis in Fig. 1) with power 45 W, is fo-\ncussed to form a waist (1\/e2 radius) of 70 \u00b5m at the\ncenter of the chamber. The beam is collimated and retro\u2013\nreflected to form a 1D optical lattice. The intensity of\nthe CO2 laser is controlled using an acousto-optic mod-\nulator (AOM). The intensity at the center of the lattice,\nI0 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\n6 Wcm\u22122, gives a ground state light\u2013shift\nU0 = \u2212\n1\n2\n\u03b10I0\/(\u01eb0c) = h(\u221236 MHz), where \u03b10 = 335 a\n3\n0\nis the ground\u2013state polarizability at 10.6 \u00b5m in atomic\nunits. A Nd:YAG laser beam (propagating at +45\u25e6 to the\ny axis in the xy plane) with power 7.8 W is focussed by a\nf = 150 mm lens to overlap with the CO2 lattice in the\ntrapping region. The Nd:YAG laser has a circular focus\nwith a beam waist of 30 \u00b5m in the overlap region. This\ngives an intensity of I0 = 5.5 \u00d7 10\n5 Wcm\u22122 leading to\na ground state light\u2013shift U0 = h(\u221218.6 MHz) using our\ncalculated value of \u03b10 = 722 a\n3\n0\nat 1.064 \u00b5m. The CO2\nand Nd:YAG laser beams are linearly polarized along the\nx and z axes, respectively.\nLoading of a CO2 laser lattice is carried out as follows:\nThe CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams are left on through-\nout the loading stage. We load a magneto-optical trap\n(MOT), centered on the dipole trap, with 2 \u00d7 107 85Rb\natoms in typically 3 seconds. After the magnetic field\nis switched off, the cooling laser beam intensities are re-\nduced from 55 mWcm\u22122 to 10 mWcm\u22122 and the detun-\ning is increased to \u2206 = \u22128\u0393, where \u0393 = 2\u03c0(6 MHz) is\nthe natural linewidth of the transition, to create an op-\ntical molasses. After 10 ms of molasses, the atom cloud\nhas a typical temperature of 40 \u00b5K, measured by time\u2013\n2FIG. 1: (a) Experimental arrangement showing the intersec-\ntion of the CO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams. Inset: Schematic\nindicating the relative scales of the CO2 and Nd:YAG spot\nsizes in the interaction region. (b) Images and line profiles\nwithout (left) and with (right) the Nd:YAG laser. The mo-\nlasses detuning (-50 MHz) is chosen to optimize the total num-\nber of atoms rather than the number in the overlap region.\nThe viewing direction is approximately perpendicular to both\nthe CO2 and Nd:YAG laser propagation directions.\nof\u2013flight. During the molasses phase the hyperfine re-\npumping laser intensity is lowered from 6 mWcm\u22122 to\n200 \u00b5Wcm\u22122 and then switched off completely with a\nshutter for the final 5 ms such that atoms are pumped in\nthe lower hyperfine state [16]. After the molasses phase,\nthe cooling light and the Nd:YAG laser are extinguished\nfor a few hundred milliseconds, then the CO2 laser is\nturned off and the MOT beams (tuned to resonance)\nare turned back on to image the cloud. A CCD cam-\nera collects the fluorescence to give a spatial profile of\nthe trapped atoms. A typical atom distribution viewed\napproximately perpendicular to the CO2 and Nd:YAG\nbeam axes is shown in Fig. 1(b). One sees that the CO2\nlattice loads efficiently out in the wings where the trap\ndepth is smaller. This effect has been widely observed\nin experiments on far-off resonance optical dipole traps\n[13, 17, 18] and arises due to the smaller differential light\u2013\nshift between the ground and excited states away from\nthe focus. We also see that the loading is greatly en-\nhanced in the region where the Nd:YAG laser intersects\nthe CO2 laser lattice.\nRemarkably, if we detune the cooling light slightly to\nthe blue of the unperturbed atomic resonance such that\nneither the CO2 nor the Nd:YAG laser beams alone trap\nany atoms, then we still observe that the region where the\ntwo beams intersect is efficiently loaded, see Fig. 2(b).\nThis spatial selectivity provides a very clear demonstra-\ntion of the power of light\u2013shift engineering using an aux-\niliary laser field. In addition, it demonstrates that the\nenhanced loaded observed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(a) cannot\nbe explained by a \u2018dimple\u2019 effect [19], where atoms from\nthe wings of a trap rethermalise in the deeper overlap\nregion [20].\nFIG. 2: A surface plot of the column density for cooling laser\ndetunings (a) \u2206 = 2pi(\u221220 MHz) and (b) \u2206 = 2pi(+2 MHz).\nThe on\u2013axis density is shown on the back plane. For blue\u2013\ndetuning (b) only the light\u2013shift engineered region, where the\nCO2 and Nd:YAG laser beams overlap, is loaded.\nFinally, we should add that the enhanced loading ob-\nserved in the overlap region cannot be explained simply\nby the fact that the trap is deeper in this region. To\ndemonstrate this we have reduced the CO2 laser power\nby a factor of four such that the depth in the combined\nCO2 plus Nd:YAG trap is less than a CO2 lattice alone\nat full power. Typical column densities are shown in Fig.\n3. We see that the density in the combined trap is still\nsignificantly higher than for a deeper CO2 lattice.\nTo explain the spatially selective loading for blue\u2013\ndetuned cooling light, we have calculated the polarizabil-\nity of the 5s ground and 5p excited states as a func-\ntion of wavelength. The details of the calculation will\nbe explained elsewhere [21]. Briefly, the scalar polar-\nizability \u03b10 is the average of the dipole polarizabilities\n\u03b1xx, \u03b1yy and \u03b1zz for an atom exposed to a laser field\npolarized, respectively, in the x, y, and z-directions:\n\u03b10 = (\u03b1xx + \u03b1yy + \u03b1zz)\/3.

The overall ground\nstate light\u2013shift in the overlap region of the shallow combined\ntrap (\u221227 MHz) is less than the maximum light-shift for the\nCO2 laser lattice alone (\u221236 MHz), but loading into the com-\nbined trap is still significantly more efficient. Both profiles\nare for a molasses detuning of \u221220 MHz.\nthe same for all m-components of the 5p state. In addi-\ntion, there is a tensor polarizabilty \u03b12 = (\u03b1xx \u2212 \u03b1zz) \/3\nwhich lifts the degeneracy of different m-states. In order\nto obtain these quantities, we represent the interaction\nof the valence electron with the core by the model po-\ntential proposed by Klapisch [22]. The polarizabilities\nare calculated by the implicit summation method [23].\nThus \u03b1xx (and similarly for \u03b1yy and \u03b1zz) is obtained as\n\u03b1xx = \u2212e(\u30080|x|1\u3009 + \u30080|x| \u2212 1\u3009)\/F , where |0\u3009 represents\nthe state vector of the unperturbed 5s, or 5p\u22121,0,1 states,\nand | \u00b1 1\u3009 are such that\n(E0 \u00b1 ~\u03c9 \u2212H0)| \u00b1 1\u3009 = eFx|0\u3009. (1)\nHere H0 is the Hamiltonian of the field-free model atom\nand E0 is the eigenenergy of the unperturbed state, i.e.\nH0|0\u3009 = E0|0\u3009, and F is an arbitrary electric field. These\nequations are solved in position space by expanding the\nwave functions on a discrete basis of radial Sturmian\nfunctions and spherical harmonics [24]. In the zero-\nfrequency limit, the resulting values of \u03b10[5s], \u03b10[5p] and\n\u03b12[5p] converge towards 333a\n3\n0, 854a\n3\n0, and \u2212151a\n3\n0, re-\nspectively, in satisfactory agreement with previous exper-\nimental and theoretical work [25]. The dynamic polariz-\nabilities as functions of wavelength are shown in Fig. 4.\nWe find that \u03b10 = 722a\n3\n0 at 1.064 \u00b5m, which agrees well\nwith experiment and other theoretical work [26, 27, 28].\nFor our purposes the most important result of Fig. 4 is\nthat the polarizabilities of the 5s state at the CO2 laser\nwavelength (\u03bb = 10.6 \u00b5m) and the Nd:YAG wavelength\n(\u03bb = 1.064 \u00b5m) have the same sign, whereas the polar-\nizabilities of the 5p state have opposite signs. It follows\nthat one can use a combination of CO2 and Nd:YAG\nlasers to tune the differential light\u2013shift between the 5s\nand 5p states through zero.

It is equal to the light\u2013shifts of the\nmF = \u22124, . . . ,+4 magnetic sub-levels of the 5p\n2P3\/2(F = 4)\nminus that of the ground state state in 85Rb for atoms in (a)\nthe CO2 laser lattice only, and (b) in the combined CO2 plus\nNd:YAG trap.\ntrap we calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix [29, 30]\nU = U0 \u2212\n1\n2\u01eb0c\n\u2211\ni=1,2\n(\u03b1i01+ \u03b1\ni\n2Q\ni)Ii , (2)\nwhere U0 is a diagonal matrix with components cor-\nresponding to the hyperfine splitting, the index i de-\nnotes the CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers, and Q\ni is a ma-\ntrix with components \u3008F,mF |Q\u00b5|F\n\u2032,m\u2032F \u3009 with Q\u00b5 =\n[3J\u02c62\u00b5 \u2212 J(J + 1)]\/J(2J \u2212 1) and J\u00b5 being the electronic\nangular momentum operator in the direction of laser field\ni. The differential light\u2013shift between the ground state\nand the 5p2P3\/2(F = 4) state for the CO2 laser alone\nis shown in Fig. 5(a). As a single laser beam splits the\nstates according to the magnitude of mF , there are five\n4curves corresponding to |mF | = 0, . . . , 4. We see that all\nthe levels are far blue-detuned (positive differential shift)\nat the centre of the lattice, making laser cooling ineffec-\ntive unless the cooling light is detuning to the red by an\namount larger than the differential light\u2013shift. Adding\nthe Nd:YAG laser produces the shifts shown in Fig. 5(b).\nThe Nd:YAG laser lifts the degeneracy between the \u00b1mF\ncomponents, although two pairs of states remain close to\ndegenerate. More importantly, one pair of states is pulled\ndown into the region of negative differential shift. This al-\nlows efficient laser cooling in the center of the overlap re-\ngion, even when the cooling light is slightly blue\u2013detuned\nrelative to the unperturbed resonance frequency. Note\nthat, efficient loading for blue\u2013detuning can only be ex-\nplained if one includes the tensor polarizability term \u03b12.\nAlthough \u03b12 is smaller than the scalar polarizability (by\na factor of 4 or 5), it dramatically alters whether states\nsee the cooling light as red or blue detuned and therefore\ncompletely determines whether the trap is loaded or not.\nAs light\u2013shift engineering allows laser cooling to work\nas efficiently as in free space one might expect to load\natoms at lower temperature than in conventional loading\nschemes. To address this issue we need to increase the\nsensitivity and the resolution of our imaging system to\nallow accurate density and temperature measurements.\nThis will be the focus of future work.\nTo conclude, we have shown how light-shift engineering\nusing an auxiliary laser field can be used to implement\nspatially selective loading of deep far-off resonance opti-\ncal lattices. We have performed theoretical calculations\nof the atomic polarizabilities and have shown that the\naddition of a second laser field induces a splitting of the\nexcited state which is crucial in determining the efficiency\nof loading into the combined trap. The technique could\nbe applied to load a single-site in 3D CO2 lattice, with\nthe interesting prospect of BEC in the limit of high trap\nfrequency. In addition one could adapt the technique\nto perform patterned loading of optical lattices [31] for\napplications in QIP experiments.\nWe thank E. Riis, I. G. Hughes, and S. L.
