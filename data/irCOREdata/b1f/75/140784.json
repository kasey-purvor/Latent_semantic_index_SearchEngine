The addition of municipal solid waste to biomass combustion\nhas the effect of reducing emissions of some gaseous pollutants.\nBackground\nConcurrent combustion of biomass and municipal solid\nwaste (MSW) offers a method of electricity and heat\ngeneration using renewable energy resources. At small\nscale, biomass is recognised as a form of renewable\nenergy that is capable of meeting both heat and electri-\ncity demand most effectively in the form of combined\nheat and power, contributing towards international com-\nmitments to minimise environmental damage [1].\nFurther efficiency in using biomass can be obtained\nwhere thermal conversion occurs adjacent to areas of\ndemand (such as cities) for cooling, i.e. \u2018tri-generation\u2019,\nor combined cooling, heating and electrical power.\nTherefore, small-scale biomass combustion offers an\nexcellent method to exploit heat energy. In contrast,\nwind turbines and large-scale pulverised fuel power\nstations are primarily used to produce electricity only,\nwhere the pulverised fuel may contain biomass for co-\nfiring. Within waste management government policy,\nenergy recovery from MSW is seen as an essential\nrequirement for diverting waste from landfill disposal.\nAs a result of Europe-wide legislation and government\ntargets to minimise the environmental impact of landfill\ndisposal, for example it is forecast that energy recovery\nwithin UK is expected to comprise 25% of MSW dispo-\nsal by 2020; recent rates are 10% [2]. Combustion of\nbiomass is often assumed to provide nil net anthropo-\ngenic carbon dioxide emissions and carbon emissions\nassociated with biomass collection and distribution\nactivities are similar to those for fossil fuels [3] and\ntherefore may be accepted as being of minimal damage* Correspondence: n.j.simms@cranfield.ac.uk\nEnergy Technology Centre, Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, UK\nLaryea-Goldsmith et al. Chemistry Central Journal 2011, 5:4\nhttp:\/\/journal.chemistrycentral.com\/content\/5\/1\/4\n\u00a9 2011 Laryea-Goldsmith et al\nto the environment. In contrast, the combustion of\nMSW is often considered to be detrimental both to\nhuman health and environmental management primarily\nbecause of various gaseous pollutants, most commonly\npublic health risk concern about poly-chlorinated\ndibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [4]. The most\ncommon assessment of biomass and MSW fuels has\nbeen to investigate combustion of biomass with coal, or\ncoal with MSW. This paper is an investigation into the\ncombustion of biomass and source separated MSW, spe-\ncifically the extent of gaseous emissions.\nDried distillers\u2019 grains with solubles (DDGS) is investi-\ngated in this paper as an example biomass fuel, pro-\nduced as an agricultural by-product in the manufacture\nof ethanol by fermentation. Historically, DDGS is used\nas animal feed but as a result of increased ethanol pro-\nduction, it is forecast to be of greater use as an energy\nsource [5]. The MSW fuel was selected from the\nsource-separated rejected material of a materials recy-\ncling facility. At least within the UK, combustion of\nMSW is considered by some to be a barrier against\nefforts to increase historically low levels of materials\nrecycling. As a consequence, this material fraction was\nidentified as a fuel source that could be exploited with-\nout impact upon the higher priority recycling of waste\nmaterials and therefore maintaining the \u201cwaste hierar-\nchy\u201d of sequentially preferred methods of waste manage-\nment: a) reduction of waste b) reuse of waste materials\nc) recycling & composting d) energy recovery e) landfill\nwith energy recovery f) landfill [2]. This material is\ntermed in this paper: \u201cmaterials recycling facility resi-\ndue\u201d (MRFR), to represent a truly residual waste fuel\nthat does not conflict with materials recycling activities.\nA pilot-scale fluidised bed combustor was used to\nburn biomass and MRFR in mixtures of various propor-\ntions. The effect of the MRFR waste fraction of the fuel\nmixture upon gaseous pollutant emissions during com-\nbustion was investigated using an FTIR flue gas analyser.\nThis analytical technique suggested that addition of the\nMRFR to the fuel mixture inhibited emission of some\npollutants. Use of rejected material from materials recy-\ncling facilities suggests that energy conversion of such\nwaste is practicable and that variation in the composi-\ntion of the fuel types can be tolerated, to represent the\ngeographical constraints and seasonal changes in avail-\nability of these fuels.\nResults\nThe general target control parameters for operation of\nthe combustor were as follows: a) temperature 850\u00b0C\n(to mimic the mandatory minimum temperature\nrequired for a combustor consuming MSW as a fuel);\nb) flue gas oxygen content <10% (to indicate operational\nefficiency); c) duration at least two hours. The fluidised\nbed material consisted of silica sand and industrial lime-\nstone, 50% by weight of each material and total bulk\nmass 22 kg and the level of fluidisation was measured\nby use of a micromanometer (model MDG FC001, Fur-\nness Controls; Burgess UK), to monitor the differential\npressure caused by the dynamic motion of gas through\nthe fluidised bed particles. Operating conditions for the\nfluidised bed combustor are summarised in Table 1.\nGas pollutant emissions\nThis paper is focussed on emissions of hydrogen chlor-\nide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides from DDGS-\nMRFR combustion in the fluidised bed combustor. The\nfollowing graphs (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10)\nsummarise these emissions for the range of fuel mix-\ntures studied. Emissions data presented here correspond\nto periods during the combustion test when stable com-\nbustion conditions were maintained. The fuel mixtures\nof DDGS and MRFR consisted of the following DDGS\nfractions, by weight: 90%; 80%; 50%; 30%. Where graphs\nshow temperature, this is a measure of the \u2018in-bed\u2019 tem-\nperature of fluidised bed material within the fluidised\nbed combustor. The \u2018box and whisker\u2019 graphs (Figures 1\nand 2) are interpreted as follows: median value repre-\nsented by the bold horizontal line; interquartile range\n(contains 50% of data set) represented by the area inside\nthe box; horizontal lines above and below interquartile\nrange box represent maximum and minimum values in\ndata set; \u2018outliers\u2019 represented by circle (\u25cb) symbol and\ndefined as a datum 1.5 greater and\/or lesser than the\ninterquartile range.\nDiscussion\nCombustion of waste materials requires attention to\nensure complete combustion is achieved in order to\nminimise gaseous pollutant emissions. The variation in\ntemperature experienced during combustion of biomass\nand MRFR fuels may be attributed to volatile compo-\nnents in both fuel fractions being released in a random\nmanner as the fuel mixes with the fluidised bed during\ncombustion. The fuel was observed to ignite and burn\noften almost immediately upon entry into the freeboard\narea, as has been reported elsewhere during co-combus-\ntion with coal and paper, plastic waste [6]. Temperature\nper se has a significant impact upon reaction rates in\ngeneral and in the case of combustion, gaseous emis-\nsions may either be enhanced or inhibited by increases\nin the combustion temperature. For example, carbon\nmonoxide is an intermediate species and during com-\nbustion in the fluidised bed combustor is likely to be\nformed within localised regions of the fluidised bed\nmaterial, where fuel-rich conditions may momentarily\noccur to prevent complete combustion to carbon diox-\nide because of insufficient oxygen being present in the\nLaryea-Goldsmith et al. Chemistry Central Journal 2011, 5:4\nhttp:\/\/journal.chemistrycentral.com\/content\/5\/1\/4\nPage 2 of 10\nlocal region. The rate of carbon monoxide oxidation is\ndetermined significantly by temperature; high combus-\ntion temperatures favour complete oxidation. In addi-\ntion, the availability of free radicals is also a factor for\ncarbon monoxide oxidation [7] and is a complex factor,\naffected by the presence of other pollutants such that\ncompetition for a limited concentration of free radicals\nwill be determined by reaction kinetics.\nTo demonstrate the effect of free radicals, carbon\nmonoxide emissions have been shown to be potentially\nhigher in the presence of hydrogen chloride [8], an\neffect attributed to catalytic re-combination of free radi-\ncals that reduces the availability of free radical inter-\nmediates for consequent carbon monoxide oxidation.\nThis observation is in itself affected by the combustion\ntemperature; higher temperatures (which per se discou-\nrage carbon monoxide) reduces the impact of hydrogen\nchloride as a catalyst to prevent oxidation of carbon\nmonoxide. This study has shown a less clear relation-\nship between temperature, hydrogen chloride content\nand carbon monoxide emissions. Figure 5 shows that\ncarbon monoxide emission was highest during combus-\ntion conditions of high temperature and highest hydro-\ngen chloride content. However, during combustion of\nboth pure DDGS (Figure 3) and DDGS-MRFR (50:50,\nFigure 4) a random pattern of emissions was found;\nhighest carbon monoxide emissions occurred through-\nout various temperatures. Carbon monoxide emission\nwas significantly higher for combustion of 30% DDGS\nfuel mixture and it is suggested that this is due to the\nhigh level of MRFR not having sufficient residence time\nwithin the combustion zone to achieve complete com-\nbustion of the fuel. These observations would be consis-\ntent with previous studies showing how at lower\ntemperatures, the effect of hydrogen chloride is more\nsignificant in raising the carbon monoxide level [9].\nTable 1 Summary of operation of fluidised bed combustor\nFuel mixture Fuel feed\n(kg h-1)\nInlet air\n(1 min -1)\nCombustion temperature\n(fluidised bed sand, \u00b0C)\nFlue gas content CO2\n(% vol.)\nFlue gas content O2\n(% vol.)\nFlue gas content H2O\n(% vol.)\nDDGS 6 1400 855 (848) 8.5 (8.6) 11.2 (11.1) 9.0 (9.2)\nDDGS-MRFR 5 1400 888 (861) 8.3 (7.9) 11.6 (12.0) 8.5 (8.3)\n(90:10)\nDDGS-MRFR 5 1400 864 (857) 8.8 (8.9) 11.5 (11.4) 9.4 (9.5)\n(80:20)\nDDGS-MRFR 4 1400 791 (804) 6.9 (7.3) 13.0 (12.6) 7.0 (7.2)\n(50:50)\nDDGS-MRFR 7 1400 818 (811) 10.2 (9.5) 9.7 (10.2) 9.4 (8.8)\n(30:70)\nMedian values shown for temperature and flue gas data during periods of stable combustion.

Chemistry Central Journal 2011, 5:4\nhttp:\/\/journal.chemistrycentral.com\/content\/5\/1\/4\nPage 3 of 10\nTherefore, the result shows carbon monoxide emissions\nto be dependent not only on temperature, but is also\naffected by the chlorine content of the fuel. Although\nnot measured, it is expected that other group 17 halides\nare also capable of similar effect if present in the fuel,\nas it has been reported similarly elsewhere that bromide\nand iodide cations are more effective inhibitors of car-\nbon monoxide oxidation [10].\nThe sensitivity of carbon monoxide emission to the\navailability of free radicals has a consequence with\nrespect to emissions of nitrogen and sulphur oxides. for-\nmation of these pollutants are themselves also\ndetermined by availability of free radicals [11] and it is\nclaimed in general that sulphur reduction of free radi-\ncals such as of oxygen atoms reduces the reaction rates\nof thermal NOx formation. Therefore it is to be\nexpected that competition for free radicals in order to\nachieve complete oxidation will be shown as related\ninteractions between concentrations of oxides of carbon,\nnitrogen and sulphur. During combustion of 30% DDGS\n70% MRFR, emissions of carbon monoxide occurred\nwhen nitric oxide and sulphur dioxide were at their\nhighest (Figure 8).

In addition to sulphur control, the genera-\ntion of lime (equation 2) has an impact on hydrogen\nchloride emissions. A secondary reason for the use of\nlimestone in the fluidised bed is the expected removal of\nhydrogen chloride:\nCaO + HCl CaCl H O2 2 2\u2194 + (6)\nThis reaction between lime and hydrogen chloride is\ninteresting in consideration of the melting point of\ncalcium chloride (772\u00b0C) which occurs within various\nareas of the combustor such that calcium chloride\ndeposits should be found within cooler zones of the\ncombustor. For example, during combustion of DDGS-\nMRFR (90:10) the average temperature near the flue gas\noutlet zone of the fluidised bed combustor was found to\nbe 671\u00b0C and therefore this suggestion appears plausible.\nHowever, competition between chloride and sulphur for\nreaction with limestone (equations 3, 4 and 6); reaction\nkinetics; and thermal stability of the calcium chloride\n 0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 60\nSO2 ppmv\n 80\n 100\n 120\n 140\n 160\n 180\n 200\nNO ppmv\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n 1000\n 1200\n 1400\n 1600\n 1800\n 2000\nCO ppmv\n 0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n 1000\n 1200\n 1400\n 1600\n 1800\n 2000Combustion of DDGS\u0166MRFR (30:70)\nFigure 8 Relationship between simultaneous emissions of SO2, NO and CO; combustion of DDGS-MRFR 30:70.\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\nHCl ppmv\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 30\n 35\n 40\nCO ppmv\n 250\n 300\n 350\n 400\n 450\n 500\n 550\n 600\n 650\n 700\nNO ppmv\n 250\n 300\n 350\n 400\n 450\n 500\n 550\n 600\n 650\n 700Combustion of DDGS\u0166MRFR (90:10)\nFigure 9 Relationship between simultaneous emissions of HCl, CO and NO; combustion of DDGS-MRFR 90:10.\nLaryea-Goldsmith et al.

The conse-\nquence of equation 6 is that limestone is not wholly\neffective in final removal of hydrogen chloride, but\ninstead is involved in reactions causing both generation\nand consumption of hydrogen chloride. This conclusion\nis also made elsewhere [12] and would explain the\ndetection of hydrogen chloride as shown in this paper.\nVariations in the changes in emissions with the bio-\nmass fractions in the fuel mixtures are summarised in\nFigures 1 and 2. Of surprising interest are emissions of\nnitric oxide and sulphur dioxide, where the latter is\nreduced when the waste fraction is added to the bio-\nmass. For combustion of biomass fuels using a fluidised\nbed combustor, the source of nitric oxide emissions is\nattributed mostly to the nitrogen content in the fuel;\nthis is in contrast to \u2018thermal\u2019 nitric oxides emissions\nduring coal combustion which is performed normally at\nhigher temperatures. Nitrogen content is relatively high\nin DDGS due to the original protein content; laboratory\nanalysis of the DDGS for these experiments was nearly\n5% by weight (Table 2). This compares to typical nitro-\ngen content for another biomass fuel such wheat, of\n1.5% and is a cause for relatively higher NOx emissions\nwith DDGS. In consideration of interactions between\nnitric oxide and sulphur dioxide as discussed earlier,\ncompetition for free radicals between these two pollu-\ntants appears to be most evident in the presence of\nhydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide (Figures 9\nand 10). This kinetic competition, especially in the pre-\nsence of hydrogen chloride would explain why sulphur\ndioxide emissions are suppressed. Of course, the\nprimary treatment for sulphur dioxide is calcium car-\nbonate, the mechanisms of which are described earlier\n(equations 1-5).\nConclusions\nGas analysis of the combustion of biomass with non-\nrecyclable waste suggests that stable combustion can be\nachieved and hence gaseous pollutant emissions can be\nminimised in conjunction with mandatory air pollution\ncontrol equipment. There was a reduction observed in\nemissions of nitric oxide and sulphur dioxide when the\nbiomass fraction is substituted for the waste fraction in\ncombustion of the fuel mixtures. A likely explanation\nfor this phenomenon is competition for free radical\nintermediates to prevent nitric oxide formation, at the\nexpense of sulphur dioxide which itself is then partially\nconverted to calcium sulphate by limestone.

It is envisaged that these com-\nplex relationships can form the basis for future model-\nling activities. In summary, fluidised bed concurrent\ncombustion is an appropriate technique to exploit bio-\nmass and municipal solid waste resources, without the\nuse of fossil fuels. The addition of municipal solid waste\n\u2013 ideally the non-recyclable fraction as part of a sustain-\nable waste management programme \u2013 to biomass com-\nbustion has the effect of reducing emissions of some\ngaseous pollutants.\nExperimental\nFluidised bed combustor design\nThe fluidised bed combustor (Figure 11) is based upon\nthe bubbling fluidised bed design, in which hot air of\nsufficient velocity (in this apparatus, approximately\n0.7 m s-1 for inlet air at 500\u00b0C) is injected into a bed of\nFigure 11 Fluidised bed combustor.

The fol-\nlowing diagram shows the features of the combustor\nused for this experiment. The combustion zone is of\ncuboid shape, the sides being 300 mm length, height\napproximately 1600 mm. The fluidisation air distribu-\ntion grid comprises nine nozzles, each nozzle having\n12 holes. The nozzles are arranged into three linear\nrows. The fuel feed is of Archimedes screw type, pri-\nmarily tolerable of pelletised fuels and fuel chips less\nthan 40 mm particle size. Gas analysis was performed\nusing an FTIR flue gas analyser (Protir 204 M, Protea,\nCrewe UK), where the flue gas sample was extracted via\na sample point maintained at a temperature of 180\u00b0C\nand at a location approximately 4-5 metres from the\noutlet of the combustor.\nFluidised bed material\nSilica sand (97% quartz, remainder tridymite, crystoba-\nlite) of size specification 0.5-1 mm was used (Garside\nSands; Leighton Buzzard, UK). Limestone granules\n(5 mm particle size, 39.4% calcium content) were\nobtained from Tarmac (Buxton, UK).\nFuel characteristics\nThe bulk composition of the MRFR fuel fraction selected\nfor this experiment was predominantly 90% plastics 10%\nfibres (paper, cardboard, wood). The material was com-\nminuted to an average particle size of 20 mm using a\nlaboratory scale cutting mill (Retsch; Haan, Germany).
