Some of the data (English, Russian and Tswana) has been reported in a\ndifferent form (Davies & Corbett, 1977).  We are grateful to Jules Davidoff,\nGoldsmiths College, University of London, in collaboration with whom some of the\nresearch reported here was carried out and to the following who collected data: Syd\nHiskey (!Xoo); Tat\u2019jana Borisovna Sosenskaja, Anna Rum_iskaja and El\u2019zara\nOrud_evna Ibragimova (Tsakhur); Tat\u2019jana Borisovna Sosenskaja, Pavel\nGrashchenkov, Isa Magomedov and Madina Magomedova (Bagwalal) .\nFree-sorting of colors 2\nThese studies examined naming and free-sorting behavior by informants speaking a\nwide range of languages, from both industrialized and traditional cultures. Groups of\ninformants, whose basic color vocabularies varied from 5 to 12 basic terms, were\ngiven an unconstrained color grouping task to investigate whether there are systematic\ndifferences between cultures in grouping behavior that mirror linguistic differences\nand, if there are not, what underlying principles might explain any universal\ntendencies. Despite large differences in color vocabulary, there were substantial\nsimilarities in grouping behavior across language groups, and substantial within-\nlanguage variation across informants. It seems that all informants group stimuli based\non some criterion of perceptual similarity, but those with large color vocabularies are\nmore likely to group stimuli in line with their basic color terms. The data are best\naccounted for by a hybrid system that combines a universal principle of grouping by\nsimilarity with culture-specific category  salience.\nFree-sorting of colors 3\nA number of authors have noted the human compulsion for grouping things in the\nworld into categories (Malt, 1995; Schyns, Goldstone & Thibaut, 1998, Roberson,\nDavidoff, Davies & Shapiro, 2004). Indeed categorization seems to be a fundamental\npart of human cognition. Young children start to systematically and exhaustively sort\ngroups of similar looking objects by spatial location at approximately the same time\n(within 10 days) as they enter the \u2018naming spurt\u2019 (a sudden sharp increase in\nvocabulary at around 18 months) (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997). This link between\nexhaustive sorting and naming has also been found to occur for children with Downs\nsyndrome (Mervis & Bertrand, 1994). So it appears that noticing that things in the\nworld can be classified into groups promotes fast word learning (particularly of count\nnouns that label kinds of objects) and that label learning, in turn, supports the urge to\ncategorize.\nAlthough there are obvious advantages to such grouping behavior for cognitive\neconomy, inference making and interaction with the world (Rosch, 1975), the basis for\nsuch groupings is still the source of considerable controversy (Steels & Belpaeme, in\npress; Levinson, Kita, Haun & Rasch, 2002; Saunders & van Brakel, 1997). It could be\nthat there are some obvious natural groupings in the world that human perceptual\nsystems cannot help but notice, as suggested by Rosch, (1973) in which case human\ncategorization would merely mirror the divisions already present in the world; or that\nparticular cultural needs and knowledge systems drive different groups of individuals to\nmake different groupings, in which case some groupings would be more likely in certain\nconditions than others (Wierzbicka, 1990). Yet a third possibility is that some\ncombination of natural discontinuities and particular needs and goals operates to\nproduce hybrid systems of categorization, with a universal set of underlying constraints\n(Malt, 1995).\nIn seeking to disentangle the roles of knowledge, goals and natural salience in\ncategorization a number of researchers have investigated the domain of color. Whilst the\ncolor dimension is a perceptual continuum within which humans can detect millions of\njust-noticeable-differences of hue, brightness and saturation, (Brown & Lenneberg,\nFree-sorting of colors 4\n1954), there is considerable diversity in the way that different cultures segment the\ncontinuum of visible colors linguistically. Some languages have been reported to use as\nfew as two \u2018basic\u2019 terms to describe all visible colors (Rosch-Heider, 1972). Others\nhave been reported to use between three and eleven (Berlin & Kay, 1969), while some\nhave twelve (Russian; Davies & Corbett, 1997; Paramei, 2005) or more. Kay, Berlin and\nMerrifield (1991) describe \u2018basic\u2019 terms (BCTs) as those terms that are monolexemic,\npresent in the idiolect of all observers and not subsumed within the meaning of other\nterms. Once one considers secondary terms there is far greater diversity (English has\nsome 4,000 words or phrases to describe colors (Brown & Lenneberg, 1954). However,\nwithin these diverse naming systems there are some noticeable generalities (Kay, Berlin,\n& Merrifield, 1991; MacLaury, 1997). It is the finding of such generalities that has led\nto the proposal that color might be one area of experience where natural discontinuities\narise (through the properties of the visual system) that lead to universals in cognitive\ncolor categorization that transcend terminological differences (e.g., Heider & Olivier,\n1972).\nA number  of recent studies have investigated measures of naming, memory and\nperceptual similarity judgments across cultures with different numbers of linguistic\ncolor categories (Davidoff, Davies & Roberson, 1999; Roberson, Davies & Davidoff,\n2000; Roberson, Davidoff, Davies & Shapiro, 2004, 2005; \u00d6zgen & Davies, 1998;\nJameson & Alvarado, 2003a). These studies have found consistent differences in a\nrange of perceptual and memory tasks, systematically linked to the color name\ncategories in each culture. Most recently, Roberson, Davidoff, Davies & Shapiro (2005)\nhave shown that even though two coding systems may appear superficially very similar,\nspeakers of the two languages encode, remember and discriminate color stimuli in\ndifferent ways. Himba, a language spoken by a semi-nomadic, cattle herding people in\nSouth West Africa, shows similarity in the number of linguistic categories for color to\nBerinmo, the Papua New Guinean language previously studied by Roberson et al.\n(2000). Both languages have five basic color categories, according to the criteria of Kay\net al. (1991). However, Himba participants showed categorical perception only for their\nFree-sorting of colors 5\nown linguistic categories and not for either the supposed universal categories of English\nor to those of the Berinmo language.\nOne criticism of these studies, however, is the suggested possibility that participants\nroutinely recruit language to the tasks used (particularly those involving memory) and\nthus they do not tap nonlinguistic representations of color (Munnich & Landau, 2003).\nThis is particularly problematic for judgments of similarity amongst patches of color\nequated for variance in hue, lightness and saturation, when having a similar name might\nbe considered just what makes two items most similar. In addition to a range of tasks\nrequiring strictly prescribed judgments we have, for some time, collected naming and\nfree-sorting data for a range of 65 Color-aid stimuli spaced across the range of visible\ncolors and varying in hue, lightness and saturation. In the free-sorting task, individuals\nare asked merely to group the items in whatever manner they see fit.\nSince the range of stimuli is large and includes both good and marginal examples of\neach cultures set of categories, one possible way of carrying out the task would be to\ngroup together those tiles that would be given the same name. This type of behavior\nshould lead to different numbers of groups, depending on the number of categories the\nculture uses. If groupings were made only according to basic terms one would expect\nbroad similarity of grouping by individuals within a community, but systematic variation\nbetween communities with different numbers of basic categories. However, if grouping\nis based on some other criterion (e.g. some level of perceptual similarity) then one might\nexpect more individual variation within populations, but less variability between different\nlanguage groups. We here compare naming and free-sorting behavior for a wide range\nof languages, from both industrialized and traditional cultures to investigate whether\nthere are systematic differences between cultures in grouping behavior and, if there are\nnot, what underlying principles might explain any universal tendencies.  We included\ntwo separate samples of (UK) English speakers, the first from the general population\nand the second from the student population and two samples of Nama-Damara\n(Khoisan from Namibia) to provide some indication of within-language variation.  We\nknew from previous studies, (Berinmo: Roberson et al.; 2002; Damara: Davies, Roling,\nFree-sorting of colors 6\nCorbett, Xoagub & Xoagub; 1998; Himba: Roberson et al. 2004; Russian: Davies &\nCorbett; 1994; Tsakhur: Davies, Sosenskaja & Corbett; Tswana: Davies, MacDermid,\nCorbett, McGurk, Jerrett, Jerrett, & Sowden; 1992; Turkish: \u00d6zgen, Davies; 1998;) pilot\nwork, or from our language consultants, that the number of basic colour terms varied\nfrom five to twelve, and these differences were most marked in the blue-green, and red-\nyellow regions. Aggregated groupings from informants in each language group were\ncompared using Multi-dimensional scaling.  Aggregating across individuals might mask\nindividual differences within the groups (and, in particular the possibility that some\nindividuals might adopt strategies of either \u2018lumping\u2019 or \u2018splitting the stimuli (see e.g.,\nShaver et al., 1987; Alvarado, 1998) and we examine this possibility. However, the\nadvantage of aggregation is that the data matrix is strongly metric and allows a variety of\nrobust analyses. We return to this issue in the discussion\nTHE LANGUAGES\nSamples were taken from native speakers of the following languages: Bagwalal and\nTsakhur (both Caucasus), Berinmo (Papua New Guinea), English (UK), Russian,\nTurkish; eleven southern African languages: Shona (Zimbabwe) Tswana (Botswana)\nand Damara, Herero, Himba, Kwanyama, Nama, Ndonga, Kwangali, Mbukushu and\n!Xoo all from Namibia.\nThe Bagwalal language belongs to the Andi subgroup of Avar-Ando-Tsez group of\nthe Nakh-Daghestan languages. There are some seven thousand native speakers and\nthere is no written version of the language. Tsakhur is a member of the Lezgic group of\nthe Nakh-Daghestanian family and there are around 30,000 native speakers Ibragimov\n(1990:3; see also Kibrik, 1999; and Davies, Sosenskaja & Corbett, 1999).\nBerinmo (also described as Bitara, e.g., Dye, Townsend and Townsend, 1966) is\none of the Alamblak languages of the Sepik Hill family of Papua New Guinea. The\nlanguage is spoken in three villages, Bitara, Kagiru and Sio, situated on the April and\nWogamush rivers. Population of the three villages is estimated to be around 500\nindividuals.\nFree-sorting of colors 7\nShona and Tswana are both Bantu spoken in Zimbabwe and Botswana (central\nzone S).  Damara and Nama are southern Khoisan languages from Namibia (see Davies,\nRoling, Corbett, Xoagub. & Xoagub,  1998 for a description of their color terms).  It is\ncommonly referred to as Nama-Damara,  reflecting its common use by two different\nethnic groups, the Nama and the Damara (see Malan, 1995). We treat them separately as\na further measure of within-language variation. !Xoo is also a southern Khoisan\nlanguage. The other languages are all Bantu from Namibia.  Ndonga and Kwanyama\n(both Central, Zone R) are the two main languages of the Owambo from the north west.\nKwanyama is also spoken in Angola.  Herero is the language of the Herero people.\nHerero and Himba are also Central, Zone R, but in a different branch to the Owambo\nlanguages.  Mbukushu and Kwangali are both spoken in Kavango, in the north east, and\nthe majority of speakers live in Angola or Zambia.  Both languages are Central, Zone K.\nMETHOD\nParticipants (by language)\nThe sample sizes, the composition of the sample by sex and the mean ages (in years) are\nshown in table 1: English group1 were all students from the University of Surrey, UK.\nEnglish group 2 were volunteers from a non-student population of normal adults living\nin Surrey, UK. All Russian participants were volunteers from a population of normal\nadults living in Moscow, Russia. Older Bagwalal informants had learned some English\nat school, whereas a few of the younger ones had learned Arabic. All Tsakhur\nparticipants were first language Tsakhur speakers, but they also spoke Russian. All\nTurkish participants were first language Turkish speakers. All Berinmo participants\nwere monolingual Berinmo speakers. The Namibian informants were from rural areas,\nand most had little or no formal education. They were all native speakers of the language\nin question, but in some samples, many also knew some Afrikaans. This is reflected in\nsome samples\u2019 use of loan terms. All participants had normal color vision (City\nUniversity Color Vision Test, Fletcher, 1988).\n (Table 1 about here)\nFree-sorting of colors 8\nInterviewers\nRussian speakers were tested by either a native speaker or a fluent Russian speaker.\nBagwalal and Tsakhur speakers were tested by native speakers, as were the English and\nTurkish samples. Berinmo speakers were tested by an English speaking experimenter\n(first author), with the aid of an interpreter from Tok Pisin (New Guinea pidgin) into\nBerinmo, using back-translation. For the African languages (except Himba and !Xoo),\ninformants were tested by first-language speakers of the appropriate language.  For\nShona and Tswana, interviewers were trained experimenters. For the remaining African\nlanguages, interviewers were student-nurses, studying in Windhoek.  They received\ninstruction in data collection from Vandervyver (their tutor) and Davies.  Data collection\ntook place in students\u2019 native villages, when they returned to their home regions to\npractice nursing, as part of their normal training.  Post-test debriefing was conducted by\nBester and Davies, to review data collection procedures. Variation in sample sizes for\neach language reflects the different number of speakers of each language.  Thus four\nNdonga speaking interviewers each tested 20 informants, while, there was just one\ninterviewer for each of Kwanyama, Kwangali, and Mbukushu. Himba speakers were\ntested by an English speaking experimenter (first author), through a Himba-speaking\ninterpreter. !Xoo speakers were also tested by an English speaking experimenter\nthrough a !Xoo-speaking interpreter.\nStimuli and Apparatus\nThe stimuli used were sixty-five Color Aid matt surface colored squares, measuring\n2 inches square and backed with stiff card. Best examples of the eleven basic color\nterms of English (black, white, gray, red, yellow, blue, green, orange, pink, purple and\nbrown) were included in the set. The stimuli were chosen to sample evenly across the\nthree dimensions of color space (hue, lightness and saturation). Color Aid stimuli were\nchosen both because they sample across the full range of saturation (the usual Munsell-\nchip array used to elicit color  terms cross-culturally contains only maximally saturated\nstimuli) and for practical considerations, given the large number of sets required, but\nFree-sorting of colors 9\nAppendix A gives the Color Aid designations and   CIE Y x y and  L*a*b* co-ordinates\nfor each color , so that they can be equated to Munsell samples.\nProcedure\nParticipants carried out the tasks in natural daylight, sitting at a table either out of\ndoors, in shaded natural sunlight, or indoors close to a window. Free-sorting always\npreceded naming to avoid introducing a name-grouping bias. The stimuli were spread\nout on the table, in random order and the participant was asked to group them so that\nones that looked similar were placed together in the way that members of a family go\ntogether. Participants who asked for clarification were told that there was no right or\nwrong way to complete the task, that they should just put together the tiles that they felt\nshould be grouped together. After participants completed the sorting task the groupings\nwere recorded by the experimenter. Subsequently stimuli were presented to participants,\none at a time, in random order and participants were asked to name each stimulus.\nRESULTS\nColor terms in the languages sampled\nTable 2 shows the number of Basic color terms (BCTs) for each language by the\ncriterion of Kay et al. (1991). BCTs are monolexemic, not subsumed under the meaning\nof other terms, not restricted to a narrow class of objects and understood by all\nobservers. English has eleven BCTs: black, white, gray, red, blue, green, yellow, pink,\norange, purple and brown. Russian and Turkish both have twelve; eleven of them are\nsimilar to English, but they divide the blue region into two (dark and light blue; see\nMoss, Davies, Corbett & Laws, 1990; Paramei, 2005 and \u00d6zgen & Davies, 1998 for\nreports). Tsakhur has a BCT equivalent to the secondary term turquoise in English\n(Davies et al., 1999). Tsakhur and Bagwalal each have a single term for the purple\/pink\nregion.  Tsakhur is focused in pink and Bagwalal in purple.  In addition Bagwalal has\nno BCTs for orange, brown or gray. Each of these regions is named with another BCT\n(e.g., orange is named as red).\nFree-sorting of colors 10\nSome of the African samples had a full set of eleven basic color terms that included\nvarious loan terms from colonial languages (Afrikaans, English or German).  Thus,\nDamara, Herero, Nama and Ndonga had eleven BCTs with borrowed terms for pink\norange and purple, such as otjiblou \u2018blue\u2019, otjigroen \u2018green\u2019, otjipinge \u2018pink\u2019 and\notjiperse \u2018purple\u2019 for Herero.  Unusually, (see for instance, Davies on Tswana; Davies\n& Corbett on Ndebele; Davies & Corbett on Xhosa) all the African languages, except\nShona, Tswana, Himba and !Xoo, had separate terms for blue and green, which in some\ncases were loan terms, as in Herero above, but in others they were original terms, such as\npgama \u2018blue\u2019 !am \u2018green\u2019. Kwangali, Mbukushu, Tswana, Shona, !Xoo, Himba and\nBerinmo all lack BCTs for pink, purple, and orange. All extend their blue, green\/ (or\ngrue) terms to colors that would be called purple in English and their red terms to colors\nthat would be called pink or orange. Berinmo and Himba color naming have been\nreported in detail elsewhere (Roberson, Davies & Davidoff, 2000; Roberson et al., 2004)\nas has Damara (Davies, 1998), Tswana (Davies, MacDermid, Corbett, McGurk, Jerrett,\nJerrett, & Sowden, 1992) and Turkish (\u00d6zgen & Davies,1998).\nWe report here only the BCTs for each language,  as all informants predominantly\nused these to describe the stimuli and used them with the greatest consensus and\nconsistency. Use of secondary terms and modifiers was limited (for example, less than\n10% of all names for both Berinmo and Himba speakers). There were some observable\ncultural differences in naming behavior. In particular, African informants left more\nstimuli un-named than speakers of other languages. Overall, those informants whose\nlanguage contained the largest number of basic terms (but also from the most\ntechnologically advanced cultures) also used the greatest number of secondary terms\nand modifiers, but this still did not account for more than 20% of total naming.\n(Table 2 about here)\nNumber of groups\nTable 2 also shows the mean number of groups formed across respondents for\neach language, the 95% confidence limits and an estimate of each language\u2019s number of\nbasic terms.  The most notable features are that Bagwalal speakers (33.6) clearly form\nFree-sorting of colors 11\nmore groups than anyone else, followed by Himba (21.4) and Berinmo (20.3).  Tswana\n(17.3), Nama (15.7) and !Xoo (15.4) come next while the remaining language-samples\nhave means ranging from 10.1 for Mbukushu to 13.7 for English group 1.  There is no\nstrong relationship between the number of groups and the number of BCTs, although\nthere is a non-significant trend for the languages with the lowest number of BCTs to\nform the most groups (r = -.35, p = .15 two-tailed). Within language groups there is\nalso some variability in the number of groups formed. For instance, Himba participants\nmade between 6 and 35 groups. Closer examination of individual differences within\ngroups revealed that very few individuals in traditional cultures \u2018lumped\u2019 rather than\n\u2018splitting\u2019 categories. Only one Berinmo informant and 3 Himba informants made less\nthan 15 groups.1\nDistance matrices\nFor each language sample, a dissimilarity or \u2018distance\u2019 matrix was constructed,\nderived from the grouping task.  We assumed that the more similar a pair of tiles were,\nthe more likely it was that they would be grouped together.  For each pair of tiles, the\nproportion of the sample that grouped them together was calculated to give a similarity\nmeasure.  The similarity measure was then inverted to produce a distance measure and\nthese proportional scores were transformed to arcsine of the proportion.  Thus, if two\ntiles were never grouped together the score would be 1.57 (arcsine (1) in radians) and if\nthey were always grouped together the score would be zero.  A matrix based on CIE\nperceptual distance was also constructed where the entries were the Euclidean distance\nbetween the points representing each pair of tiles in CIE L* a* b* co-ordinates. This\n                                                \n1 To control for the possibility that the few individuals who \u2018lumped\u2019 stimuli had a\ndisproportionate influence on the group plots, Berinmo and Himba matrices were also\ncompared after these individuals\u2019 groupings had been removed. The increase in Stress\nin both cases was extremely small (.001 and .003 respectively).  The reduction in\nvariance explained was correspondingly small. Thus it does not appear that these\nindividuals unduly influenced the group solution.\nFree-sorting of colors 12\nspace is designed to represent colors along opponent axes such that the L* axis\nrepresents the dimension light to dark, a* is the red-green axis and b is the blue-yellow\naxis.  So, for instance, red is positive high a* and green is negative low a*.  Yellow is\npositive high b* and blue is negative low b*. Subsequent testing showed that using the\nlogarithm of CIE distance (logLab) improved correlations, and we use log distance here.\nCorrelations among similarity matrices\nCorrelations across language samples for the grouping matrices were generally\nlarge and always positive, ranging from r = .42 to .93 with a mean of .69, maximum p <\n.001.  (Note that while the magnitude of r is informative, statistical significance is much\nless so.  With 2080 entries in each matrix, correlations as low as 0.1 would be highly\nsignificant).  All of the grouping matrices were also correlated with logLab (r = .45 to\n.75; mean = .59).  However, all the correlations among grouping matrices remain\npositive and moderately large with perceptual distance controlled for (r = .14 to .90;\nmean = .50).  Principal component analysis on the 18 grouping matrices found a single\ncommon factor that accounted for 70.00% of the variance.  All languages loaded heavily\non this single factor with the component matrix weights ranging from .60 for Himba to\n.93 for Damara, Nama and Ndonga. While there is, again, considerable intra-language\nvariability (even between the English informants tested), it does appear that all\ninformants group stimuli according to some common principle. We return to this issue\nin the discussion.\nMulti dimensional scaling of grouping\nOur main analysis consisted of fitting the 18 distance matrices to the INDSCAL\nmulti-dimensional scaling model (Kruskal & Wish, 1981; Norusis, 1994).  As in MDS\nin general, the analysis represents the stimuli (in our case the 65 colors) in an n-\ndimensional space, such that the Euclidean distance among points represents their\ndissimilarity: the further apart two stimuli are, the less similar they are.  INDSCAL tries\nto find a common space for all matrices, but incorporates differences among the matrices\nFree-sorting of colors 13\n(languages) in terms of the relative importance (weights) of each dimension.  Thus, each\ndimension can be \u2018squashed\u2019 or \u2018stretched\u2019 to accommodate differences among the\nlanguages and the relative importance of each dimension in the overall solution is given.\nIf the dimensions are interpretable in terms of some familiar color space, then the relative\nimportance of the color space dimensions for each language can be assessed.\nINDSCAL allows the \u2018seeding\u2019 of the analysis with an initial color space, and here we\nuse CIELab.  If CIELab were as good a fit as INDSCAL could find to the original data,\nthen the resultant dimensions would be identical to the seed.  On the other hand, if a\nbetter fit could be found by re-scaling the original, the resultant dimensions would differ\nfrom CIELab to some extent. The number of dimensions is a free parameter in\nINDSCAL.  The higher the number of dimensions, the better the fit to the original data,\nas indicated by R2 and Kruskal\u2019s stress.  However, goodness of fit needs to be tempered\nby interpretability, and by diminishing returns as the dimensionality increases.\nWe first applied INDSCAL to the 18 distance matrices for the full set of 65 stimuli.\nWe then \u2018zoomed in\u2019 on three sub-regions where the differing patterns of naming\nacross languages suggested that if there were to be grouping differences related to the\nlanguage differences, then these were the most likely places to detect them.  These three\nsub-regions were: purple-blue-green; pink-purple; and red-orange-pink.  The stimuli for\nthe sub-analyses were selected on the basis of their CIELab co-ordinates, and the\npredominant name for all languages was either one of the terms used in that region, or\nthey were not named.  For instance, for purple-blue-green, tiles were named with either a\npurple, blue, green or grue term by at least 20% of each sample.  CIELab was used as\nthe starting configuration for all analyses and the 3d solution had acceptably small stress\nlevels in all cases, plus the benefit of interpretability of the dimensions.  The analyses\nwere also done with no seed, but in all cases the CIELab seed led to lower stress levels.\nFor each analysis, we mapped the locations of the stimuli in CIELab space (a*, b*\nand a*, L*); then in the derived dimensions of best fit (dimension1 versus dimension2;\ndimension1 versus dimension3); and finally, plotted each language in \u2018weight space\u2019\nshowing the relative importance of the three dimensions for each language. Where there\nFree-sorting of colors 14\nis clear correspondence between a CIELab dimension and a derived dimension, where\npossible, we used equivalent axis orientation and we label the axes with their nearest\nCIELab equivalent.  2Among our stimuli we labeled the best examples of the English\nterms as \u2018landmarks\u2019, although there is some variation from graph to graph because of\noverlap in locations in some views.  We also add some tile labels in some graphs to aid\ninterpretation further.\nINDSCAL for all 65 tiles\nFigures 1a and 1b the 65 Color Aid tiles used in the free sorting task plotted in the\n3 dimensions of CIELab a*(red-green), b* (blue-yellow) and figures 1c and 1d shows\nthem plotted in dimension 1 (dim1) and dimension 2 (dim2) of the INDSCAL solution\nplotted in a*, L* (lightness). The nearest equivalent in Lab for each dimension is given\nin parenthesis. The achromatic stimuli, black gray and white occupy more or less the\nsame location in a* b* and are labeled gray; brown is not shown but also falls in about\nthe same location.  The separate location for these terms can be seen in the a* (red-\ngreen), L*(lightness) plane (figure 1b). Figures 1e and 1f  show the relative weights for\neach language for the INDSCAL solution corresponding to the derived dimensions of\nbest fit (d1wt, d2wt). The nearest equivalent in LAB for each dimension is given in\nparenthesis. The points should be thought of as the ends of vectors, such that the vector\nlength represents goodness of fit for that language to the derived stimulus space, and the\nangle of the vector represents the relative importance of the two dimensions.\nThe 3d solution had moderate stress levels for each language (.21-.31).  Although\nthe initial configuration had been modified somewhat, the derived dimensions were still\nhighly correlated with CIELab (minimum r = .82).  Comparing figures 1a - 1e it can be\nseen that the stimuli in the derived dimensions (1b and 1c) are more noticeably clustered\nthan in CIELab (1a and 1b) and these clusters tend to include the good examples of the\nputative universal categories labeled blue, green etc..  The achromatic stimuli (black, gray\n                                                \n2 In all graphs we exclude the origin to magnify the region of interest, but the\ncontinuation of the diagonal from the origin can be constructed by joining the false\norigin (bottom left) to the top right.\nFree-sorting of colors 15\nand white) that were not separated in a* b* are more separated in the first two derived\ndimensions with white and gray occupying the centre, but black being placed close to\nbrown, near yellow. As a corollary, to compare two languages, the angle between their\nvectors is an index of similarity: the smaller the angle, the greater the similarity.  For\ninstance, goodness of fit is low for Himba, and higher for Berinmo, but the relative\nimportance of the dimensions is approximately the same for the two groups.  In both\ncases they weight the red-green dimension  more heavily than the blue-yellow\ndimension, as indicated by their location below the diagonal (equal weights) and the\nrelatively small angle between the two vectors.  Kwanyama is similar to Berinmo and\nHimba, with the remaining languages having relatively small angular separations.  Figure\n1e shows that most languages weight the red-green dimension more than the blue-\nyellow dimension as most points lie below the diagonal.  The Himba, Russian, Turkish\nTswana and the two English groups appear to show this pattern most extremely.\n(Figures 1a, b, c, d, e, f about here)\nThe purple-blue-green region\nThere were 21 stimuli within a sector below a diagonal joining a*= 50 to b*= 60\nand these can be seen in Figures 2a, b with landmark PURPLE, BLUE and GREEN\nlabels. This region is of special interest since five of the languages tested: Tswana,\nShona, Himba, !Xoo and Berinmo name this region of the color space with a single\nterm. All other languages have separate terms for green and blue. In addition, Turkish\nand Russian have two basic blue terms and Tsakhur seems to have a turquoise, hence\nthese languages differentiate the blue green region more than others. Finally, Kwangali\nappears to have two green terms.\n The stresses for the 3d solution ranged from .12 for Damara and Ndonga to .27\nfor Himba and Shona (mean = .20).  The first dimension (weighting = .45) correlated\nstrongly with b*(blue-yellow) (r = .85) while the second most important dimension\n(.27) correlated strongly with a*(red-green) (r = .85).  The third dimension was\nrelatively unimportant on average (.04) and correlated most strongly with L*(lightness)\n(r = .60).  Figure 2c shows the location of the 21 stimuli in the first two derived\nFree-sorting of colors 16\ndimensions.  As with the first analysis, the stimuli are more notably clustered in the\nderived dimensions than in CIELab.  There are three relatively isolated clusters, one in\nthe green region (top left) one in the blue region (bottom left) and one in the purple\nregion (on the right).  There are also clusters around green, blue and purple in the other\nplane (Figure 2d).  Figure 2e shows the corresponding language weights for the first\ntwo dimensions.  There is considerable variation in both the goodness of fit (vector\nlength) and in the relative importance of the two dimensions.  The fit is relatively poor\nfor Himba, Berinmo and Shona, and relatively strong for Kwanyama, Ndonga, Nama,\nMbukushu, Herero, Damara, English1 and Kwangali.  The languages with the highest\nrelative weights for dimension1(~blue-yellow) are Tsakhur, Turkish, Bagwalal, English,\nRussian and Kwangali.  Note, that, these include all the languages with putative extra\nBCTs in the blue-green region.  At the other extreme are: Himba, Kwanyama, Ndonga,\nand !Xoo.  In the other weight plane (Figure 2f), English, Russian and Tsakhur, weight\ndimension1(~blue-yellow) much more than dimension3 (~lightness), with Kwanyama\nand Himba at the other extreme, followed by !Xoo, Bagwalal, Berinmo and Ndonga.\nThus there is a correlation between the relative goodness of fit for grouping matrices and\nthe number of BCTs in each language. There are more coherent grouping arrangements\nby informants from those languages with most terms for colors in this region and least\nagreement from informants whose languages use a single term to denote all colors in\nthis range.\n(Figures 2 a, b, c, d, e, f about here)\nPurple-pink region\n There were 14 stimuli in the purple pink region with positive a* values, and b*\nvalues less than 50.  Their locations in CIELab are shown in Figures 3a,b.  This region\nis of interest because Tsakhur and Bagwalal each have a single term for purple-pink.\nTsakhur is focused in pink and Bagwalal in purple. Kwangali, Mbukushu, Shona, !Xoo,\nHimba and Berinmo have no purple or pink terms, and the area is named partly with the\nred term and partly with blue or grue terms. Stresses for the 3d solution ranged from .14\nfor Mbukushu to .30 for Himba (mean = .21).  However, unlike the earlier analyses, the\nFree-sorting of colors 17\nderived dimensions each load on more than one CIELab dimension, and the derived\ndimensions have, on average, about equal weights, between .22 and .23.  Dimension 1\ncorrelates strongly with L*(lightness) (r = .92, but also strongly with b* (blue-yellow)\n(r = .73).  Dimension 2 correlates mainly with a* (red-green) (r = .81) but also\ncorrelates with b*(blue-yellow)  (r = .54).  Dimension 3 correlates with a* (r = .68) and\nb* (r = .56).  Dimension 3 appears to be \u2018chroma\u2019 or colorfulness dimension, which in\nthe CIELab space is the root-mean square of a* and b* and is designated c*.  Figures\n3c, d show stimulus locations in the derived color space.  Light pinks are grouped\ntogether towards the top right, blue-purples (e.g., BVBHue) are towards the bottom left,\naway from red-pinks (e.g.. ROSE) towards bottom right, leaving purples at centre\nbottom.  Similar clusters can be seen in the other plane.  Figure 3e shows the weights\nfor the first two dimensions (~L*, ~a*) for each language.  It can be seen that, with the\nexception of Himba, there is not much spread in goodness of fit (vector length), but\nthere is in the relative weights (angles) with Tsakhur weighting dimension 2 the most\nand Kwanyama, the least.  Most of the African languages together with Bagwalal and\nBerinmo, are located above the diagonal from the origin (highly lightness-based\ngrouping), while languages that have separate terms for red, pink and\/or purple are\nlocated below the diagonal.  But, there are also notable inconsistencies: one English\ngroup lies above the diagonal and one below; and Shona clearly falls below, and is apart\nfrom other African languages.  Fig 3f shows the weights for dimension 3 (~c*) versus\ndimension 1 (~L*).  There is less angular spread in this plane than in Figure 3e, and\nsimilarities among related languages are also less clear.\n(Figures 3 a, b, c, d, e, f about here)\nRed-orange-pink\nThe 12 stimuli were from the top right quadrant of the a*, b* plane (a* >30, b* >0)\nand their CIELab locations can be seen in Figures 4a,b.  Stress levels for the 3d solution\nranged from .14 for English1 to .25 for Himba (mean = .20).  The first derived\ndimension correlated strongly with b* (r = .94), the second with a* (r = .87) but also\ncorrelated negatively with L* (r = -.76).  The third dimension was harder to interpret as\nFree-sorting of colors 18\nit did not correlate significantly with any CIELab dimension.  Some clue may be gleaned\nfrom considering the two highest correlations which are with L* (r = .50) and a* (r = -\n.43); \u2018light and not-red\u2019.  The relative importance of the dimensions was .33, .23 and .16\nfor the first to third dimensions respectively.  Figure 4c shows the location of the stimuli\nin the first two dimensions.  It can be seen that good reds lie to the right, light pinks to\nthe left, and orange lies at the top.  In Figure 4d, the other plane is shown, and the two\nextremes of dimension 3 are dark-red-pink (ROSE) and light pink (pink).  Fig 4e shows\nthe weights for each language for the first two dimensions (~b*, ~a*)and Fig. 4f for the\nfirst and third dimensions (~b*, ~unidentified).  There is considerable spread of the\nvector angles in both diagrams.  In 4e, English1, English2, Herero, Russian, and Tsakhur\nclearly weight dimension 1 more than dimension2, and Turkish has the next highest\nratio.  At the other extreme, Kwanyama, Berinmo, Mbukushu, Kwangali and Ndonga\nclearly weight dimension 2 more heavily than dimension 1.  Bagwalal, Shona and Himba\nalso fall below the diagonal.  Thus the languages with separate terms for red, orange and\npink weight dimension 1 more than dimension 2 and most of the languages with\ncomposite red or yellow terms weight dimension 2 more heavily than dimension 1.  A\nsimilar separation can be seen in Fig. 4f, except that Damara and Nama now cluster with\nEnglish, Russian, Tsakhur, Herero and Turkish, all having high dimension1 to\ndimension3 ratios.  Kwanyama lies at the other extreme, with Berinmo, Himba, Ndonga,\nMbukushu and Kwangali lying on or below the diagonal.\n (Figures 4 a, b, c, d, e, f about here)\nDISCUSSION\nThese studies set out to compare the naming of a set of color stimuli with the\nunconstrained grouping of those same stimuli by individuals from different cultures,\nwhose color vocabulary differs in both the number of BCTs and the range of colors that\nthose terms denote. Previous studies, using more constrained methods (e.g. 2-alternative\nforced-choice memory tests, same-different judgments, odd-one-out judgments) have\nfound consistent differences between cultures whose languages code the range of visible\ncolors in different ways (Roberson et al., 2000; Roberson et al., 2004, 2005; Pilling &\nFree-sorting of colors 19\nDavies, 2004). Those studies, however, used narrow sets of very similar stimuli, and\nnaming may have routinely been recruited to perform the tasks, since other variables\nwere strictly controlled. In the current studies, subjects were asked to group a very\ndisparate set of stimuli in any way they saw fit.\nThe unconstrained nature of the task resulted in some substantial differences in\nbehavior between individuals. The differences between the mean grouping behavior of\nthe two groups of English informants places them further from each other in figures 1e\nand 1f than either is to Russian or Damara, for instance. Aggregating group data might\nmask individual differences in grouping strategy within a language group, such as the\ntendency to either \u2018lump\u2019 large numbers of stimuli together or \u2018split\u2019 them into many\nvery small clusters, but there are several reasons why this is unlikely to account for the\ngroup differences found here.\nFirstly, if the tendency to adopt either one or the other of these two strategies were\nrandomly distributed across all groups, such individual differences would weaken the\ndifferences found between cultures. Only if individual differences vary systematically\nwith language groups could they give rise to the cultural differences noted above.\nSecondly, the differences across language groups aren\u2019t of a general nature, but are to\nbe found specifically where the languages differ most. Thirdly,  excluding the languages\nwith large numbers of groups (the \u2018splitters\u2019), there are language related differences\namong samples with very similar mean numbers of groups (and standard errors) e.g.\nKwanyama-Kwangali-Mbukushu\/Tsakhur-English-Russian.\nMoreover, if participants generally chose to group stimuli on some broad universal\nprinciples, then broad similarity of grouping should be seen across cultures, in spite of\nthe variability in individual behavior. At the same time, if the perceived similarity of\nstimuli is genuinely influenced by a learned set of categories, then consistent differences\nshould emerge between speakers of different languages, despite the variability in\nindividual behavior.\nThe results show evidence of both broad generalities of grouping behavior, as\nindicated by the strength of the MDS fits between languages, and of some systematic\nFree-sorting of colors 20\ndifferences. The degree of fit found between cultural groups could arise if all informants\noperate a loose general principle of grouping by perceptual similarity (the MDS fits\ncorrelate highly with the proximity of the stimuli in CIE Lab space). Such a principle\nneed not be strongly categorical, but might preclude the formation of an arbitrary\ncategory that includes, say, red and yellow, but excludes orange (Davies, 1998; Dedrick,\n1996; Jameson & Alvarado; 2003b; Roberson et al., 1999). Such a constraint can be\nequated to slicing an apple. This produces a principled division in which, wherever the\ncuts are made, the likelihood of two adjacent parts appearing in the same slice is high,\nwhile the likelihood of two parts from opposite sides of the apple appearing in the same\nslice diminishes with the number of cuts made. Thus, the potential for variability when\nfew groups are made is much higher than when many groups are made, and not all\npotentially possible groupings are logically coherent. If participants take both lightness\nand hue into account, (dividing the apple along two planes), there are considerable\nconstraints on possible groupings. The principle of grouping by perceptual similarity,\nrather than by name alone, could yield this degree of inter-language agreement between\ninformants with radically different color vocabularies, provided perceptual color space\nwas shared by all samples.\nThere is also evidence, from Figure 1f, that all languages appear to weight hue more\nthan brightness when grouping stimuli in an unconstrained way, in spite of the fact that\nthose languages with few BCTs have more lightness-based linguistic categories and the\nrelationships between languages remain quite strong when L*a*b* distances are\npartialled out. One reason for this might be that the use of only three dimensions in the\nINDSCAL solution might increase apparent similarities to a certain extent (concealing\nsome regional differences that would be apparent in a solution with more dimensions,\nbut there is a body of evidence (see Jameson, 1997) to show that three dimensions\nrepresent psychological color space very well.\nIn spite of the potential limitations of a 3 dimensional approach, alongside the broad\nsimilarities observed between languages, detailed examination of particular areas of the\nstimulus set reveals some systematic variation between informants whose languages\nFree-sorting of colors 21\nname each area with different numbers of BCTs,.  Examination of the grouping of\nstimuli in the green \u2013 blue \u2013 purple range revealed that informants from those languages\nthat do not have separate terms for these stimuli show least agreement in their groupings,\nwhile informants from those languages with all three terms show the most similar\ngrouping tendencies. Those languages with separate terms for blue and green also tend\nto divide the blue and green stimuli into separate groups, as evidenced by their high\nrelative weights on dimension 1 (~b* blue-yellow), while those that use a single grue\nterm do not. Similar systematic differences are seen in the red - orange \u2013 pink region,\nwhere most of the languages that have separate terms for red, orange and pink weight\ndimension 1 (lightness) more and dimension 2 less than those languages that have no\nseparate terms for this region. Along all three dimensions, in fact, there is clear\nseparation. Those languages with separate terms make very similar groups of stimuli,\nwhile those with composite red or yellow terms make much more diverse groupings. A\nsimilar pattern emerges from the grouping of stimuli in the purple \u2013 pink region,\nalthough here the dimensions of best fit are less clearly associated with hue or lightness\ndimensions, and there is less agreement between languages on the weighting of the\nrelative dimensions. In particular, the means for two groups of English informants are\nseen to differ in the relative weighting of dimensions 1 and 2. Thus there is less\nsystematic variation in this region between the sorting behavior of groups who name the\nstimuli with different numbers of BCTs.\nThe data make important theoretical contributions to the debate on linguistic and\ncultural relativity on two counts. Firstly, if individuals always grouped stimuli purely\naccording to their linguistic categories, there should be a high level of within-language\nagreement on groupings, combined with a systematic variation between languages in\nthe number of groups formed. This pattern was not observed. Instead, it appears that\ninformants generally make more groups than they have BCTs, basing their grouping\nbehavior on a looser universal principle of perceptual similarity. The influence of\nlinguistic category emerges in a more subtle way, in the inverse relationship between\nthe number of linguistic categories an informant has and the number of groups they\nFree-sorting of colors 22\nchose to make. Informants from languages with a large number of BCTs also have a\nwide vocabulary of secondary terms, for which there is little inter-informant\nagreement on the referents. These informants may thus still base their groups on\nlinguistic categories, but use a combination of basic and secondary categories in\nvariable combinations. Those informants with very limited color vocabularies may\ninstead abandon their linguistic categories in this task and group only based on a very\nrestricted criterion of perceptual similarity, thus producing many groups with only\ntwo or three stimuli in.\nInevitably, the combination of such a broad data set with an unconstrained task\ncreates a considerable degree of noise in the data. The use of aggregated group data and\nthe compression of solutions to just three dimensions might also inflate the apparent\nsimilarity in the behavior of individuals from different cultures and language groups. In\nspite of this, important differences between languages emerge when detailed examination\nof sub-sets of the stimuli is carried out. Thus in the green \u2013 blue \u2013 purple and red \u2013\norange \u2013 pink ranges, the findings of these studies support a consistent linguistic\ninfluence on categorization provided by more constrained paradigms. Even under free-\nsorting conditions there is still evidence that informants group stimuli in line with their\nlanguage categories. Thus informants seem to combine a universal underlying grouping\nconstraint with differential cultural goals when freely categorizing colors into groups.\nFree-sorting of colors 23\nAppendix A\nDesignations of the 65 Color Aid tiles in the C.I.E.
