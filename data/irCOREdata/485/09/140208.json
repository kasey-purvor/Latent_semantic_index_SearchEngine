In many of these areas the final structure is \nroutinely subject to severe shock during in-service life.  Shock waves occur when the incident \nstress exceeds a materials dynamic flow strength; at this point, material shear strength (resistance \nto shear) is essentially zero and the material behaves in a fluid-like manner, e.g. hydrodynamically.  \nThe structure of certain materials, including many polymers, means that under such high strain-\nrates changes in material properties occur.  In such cases the material properties in question are \nsaid to be strain-rate dependant [3].  It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the \nresponse of polymer-based materials to high rates of strain (e.g. shock loading).  Experimentally, \nthe plate impact technique has been widely employed to investigate material strain rates \u2265 106 \/s \n[4].  Compressive shocks are generated within a target material following impact of a flat\/parallel \nflyer plate accelerated using a gun (typically driven by either compressed gas or a pyrotechnic \ncharge).  Inertial confinement results in a 1D state of strain being established within the target \n(maintained until release waves from the target edge catch up with the propagating shock).  \nSuitable instrumentation (e.g. embedded stress gauges) then allows key experimental properties to \nbe determined.  These are: (a) US \u2013 the propagation velocity of the induced shock through the \ntarget material; (b) uP \u2013 the continuum velocity of the material behind the shock front (known as \nthe mass or particle velocity), and; (c) \u03c3X \u2013 the longitudinal (Hugoniot) stress established within \nthe target for the duration of the shock once the recording media has reached equilibrium.  There \nare five key shock parameters required to describe materials behaviour; shock velocity, particle \nvelocity, pressure, density and internal energy.  However, only two of these parameters are \nrequired to uniquely define the material.  A series of relations known as the Rankine-Hugoniot \nconservation equations, and based on conservation of mass, energy and momentum, allows the \nother shock parameters to be derived from the measured Hugoniot relationships.  In this case, \ndensity and internal energy may be derived from either the US-uP or \u03c3X-uP relationships.  These \nrelationships, known as Hugoniot equations-of-state, represent the US, uP, \u03c3X permutations a \nparticular shocked material will physically pass through and, when combined with strength data, \nprovide sufficient information to model the hydrodynamic response of the material in question [3]. \nPolymers fall into three broad groups [5]: thermoplastics \u2013 e.g. polymethymethacrylate (PMMA); \nthemosets \u2013 e.g. epoxy resins, as considered here, and; elastomers such as polychloroprene \n(neoprene).  Despite their important role in structural materials, only a limited body of work exists \nin the literature on the dynamic response of polymeric materials.  Due to its use as a transparent \nwindow in interferometer-based particle velocity measurement systems, the behaviour of the \nthermoplastic PMMA has been extensively characterised by Barker and Hollenbach [6].  They \nobserved a non-linear strain-rate dependence to its response at particle velocities\/stresses below \n0.7 mm\/\u00b5s and 22 kbar respectively.  This effect was linked to the presence of an elastic-plastic \ndeformation mode \u2013 however, above this region a conventional linear US-uP response was noted.  \nMillett and Bourne [7] have also conducted a detailed review of the shock response of \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n3 \nthermoplastic polymer materials \u2013 in this case focusing on the effects of side group \nsize\/complexity by considering polyethylene (H side groups), polypropylene (methyl side groups) \nand polystyrene (benzene ring side groups).  Evidence of an increase in maximum shear strength \nwith impact stress at elevated particle velocities\/stresses was noted in all cases.  This effect was \nobserved to increase in magnitude with side group size\/complexity, implying that the increasing \nscale of the side groups acted to progressively inhibit compression of the polymers.  Elastomers \nhave been suggested as potential constituents of composite armour systems \u2013 for example, Hazell \net al. [8] conducted a series of ballistic tests involving penetration of a lead-antimony cored, Cu \ngilded, 7.62 mm \u00d7 51 mm bullet into glass faced polyurethane replacement resin (PRR) targets.  \nUnderstanding of the underlying penetration mechanisms was developed and a hydrocode material \nmodel derived (and calibrated against experiment) for the PRR.  Both Millett et al. [5] and Bourne \nand Millett [9] investigated the shock response of the elastomer polchloroprene (neoprene) using \nthe plate impact technique.  They employed both longitudinal and lateral gauges to determine a \nHugoniot and, in addition, investigate the change in lateral stress behind the shock.  A divergence \nfrom the previously established linear Hugoniot (Marsh [10]) was found at lower particle \nvelocities \u2013 in this case for uP < 1.0 mm\/\u00b5s.  While this divergent section of the Hugoniot was \ntaken to be linear, only four data points were employed.  Consequently a non-linear response as \nobserved at lower particle velocities with PMMA [6] may be an alternate explanation.  An \napproximately constant gradient in lateral stress behind the shock at longitudinal impact stresses in \nthe range 1.0 \u2013 3.8 GPa was also observed (one shot at lower impact stresses did seems to imply a \nchange in gradient, but this effect disappeared above 1.1 GPa).  This result was taken to imply no \nchange in strength of the material occurred in this impact stress regime. \n \nThermosetting polymers tend to exhibit a high degree of polymer chain cross-linking, imparting \nthem with greater strength and temperature resistance over thermoplastic materials [11].  However, \nthey are relatively brittle meaning that they are often reinforced with additions such as glass or \ncarbon fibres, forming composite structures.  The desirable physical and thermal properties of \ncomposite structures have led to them being employed in a wide variety of both armour and \naerospace applications.  For example, carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) has been widely \nemployed in spacecraft structures due to the combination of its low density, high stiffness and low \nthermal expansion which leads to a high degree of thermal stability [2].  Thermosets such as epoxy \nresins (for example, Hexcel\u00ae RTM 6 [11]) have found a niche as matrix materials in such fibre \nreinforced structures.  The dynamic response of carbon fibre composite systems with RTM 6 \nepoxy matrices has been investigated by a number of authors [1, 12].  However, carbon fibre \nreinforced systems are complex and have been shown to exhibit anisotropic responses dependant \non fibre orientation.  Consequently, it is important to understand the dynamic response of \nindividual composite components.  A number of different researchers have investigated the \ndynamic response of epoxy resins.  Gerlach et al. [11] investigated strain rate effects in RTM 6, \nchosen for analysis due to its commercial importance as a matrix material in carbon fibre \nreinforced systems.  They employed a range of experimental apparatus (including a tensile test \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n4 \nmachine, a hydraulic compression rig and a split-Hopkinson bar) to investigate the response of the \nresin at strain rates in the range 10-3-104 \/s.  A substantial strain rate dependence of yield stress, \ninitial modulus and strain to failure was noted.  In particular, the strain to failure in tension \nchanged by >50 % over the range of strain rates investigated, emphasising the importance of \nunderstanding the dynamic properties of such resins.  At higher strain rates, techniques such as \nplate impact experiments (described previously) are required.  Munson and May [13] studied the \nresponse of three different forms of the epoxy resin EponTM 828 manufactured using different \nhardening agents\/curing conditions.  The different hardening agents used modified strongly the \ninherent cross-linking and therefore key material properties such as the glass transition \ntemperature.  While different responses were apparent at low strain rates, very similar Hugoniot \nrelationships were found for all three variations (representing similar high strain rate responses).  \nHazell et al. [14] conducted a review of investigations into the dynamic response of epoxy resin \nsystems and additionally independently derived a Hugoniot for RTM 6, providing data at higher \nstrain rates than that of Gerlach et al. [11].  It was shown that in the case of five separate thermoset \nepoxy resin systems, resultant linear fits to experimentally derived US-uP Hugoniot relationships \nwere consistently very similar.  Tentative evidence of an increase in strength with impact stress \nwas observed.  This conclusion was in good agreement with previous work by Millett et al. [15] \nwhere analysis of lateral gauge traces from a bespoke epoxy resin showed evidence of a negative \ngradient behind the shock whose magnitude increased with impact stress.  This result was taken to \nbe indicative of an increase in shear strength both with impact stress and behind the shock and was \ntentatively attributed to an inherent viscoelastic property of the epoxy in question. \n \nOverall, it is apparent that there is relatively little information in the literature on the high strain \nrate behaviour of epoxy resins.  In particular, relatively little work has been carried out on the \nlateral stress behaviour of such resins behind the shock.  In this paper, the approach of Millett et al. \n[15] is extended to the commercially important resin transfer moulding (RTM) 6 resin, building on \nthe description of its dynamic response set out by Hazell et al. [14].  Combinations of longitudinal \nand lateral gauges are used both to extend the previously derived RTM 6 Hugoniot and to \ninvestigate the behaviour of lateral stresses behind the shock.  In addition, recent work by Winter \nand Harris [16] and Winter et al. [17] has suggested that perceived changes in strength behind the \nshock might, at least in part, be linked to the nature of lateral gauge mounting in targets, with \nshocks propagating at different velocities through the target\/gauge packet system.  This alternate \nexplanation for observed phenomenon and its possible effects on the interpretation of the response \nof lateral gauges has not been discussed in light of epoxy resin systems.  Consequently, this \nalternate explanation for the response of lateral gauges is taken into account in the context of \nlateral gauge results presented here in order to provide a broader scope for interpreting both this \nwork and that conducted elsewhere. \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n5 \nMaterial properties \nExperimental work has focused on a commercially important epoxy\/amine resin system developed \nby Hexcel Composites (Duxford UK) primarily for use in the advanced RTM process [18,19] and \nknown by the trade name HexFlow\u00ae RTM 6.  This resin is supplied in mono-component form; e.g. \nthe epoxy and aromatic-amine curing elements are both present in the supplied mixture.  The \nmono-component resin is cast at 80\u00baC, before an initial cure in the mould at 160\u00baC for around 75 \nminutes and a final post-cure at 180\u00baC for 2 hours, with temperature changes kept to 1\u00baC\/minute at \neach stage [20].  While the mono-component nature of the resin necessitates careful storage \n(unlike conventional two-component resins, mono-component systems can undergo spontaneous \ncure at elevated temperatures), the presence of just one element simplifies injection into the mould \nduring the RTM process.  The majority of epoxy resin systems are based on the reaction products \nof Bisphenol A (2,2\u2019-Bis(4\u2019-Hydroxyphenyl)Propane) with Epichlorohydrin (1-Chloro-2,3-Epoxy-\nPropane), which react to form a polymer chain terminated by reactive epoxy groups; subsequently \na curing agent reacts with the epoxy groups to form cross-links within the final resin [21].  \nPossible curing agents include aliphatic and aromatic amines (employed in RTM 6) as well as \nanhydrides.  Final epoxy resin properties depend on numerous factors including: the choice of \nepoxy, curing agent and (where appropriate) plasticiser, and; the thermal profile of the cure.  \nBroadly speaking slower cure rates and larger polymer chains lead to greater degrees of cross-\nlinking and, therefore, greater stiffness.  However, the complexity of this process makes it difficult \nto relate structure to final epoxy properties [21]. \nThe main components of RTM 6 are: (1) an epoxy, Tetraglycidyl Methylene Dianiline (TGMDA), \nand; (2) two curing agents: (i) 4,4\u2019-Methylenebis(2,6-Diethylaniline), and (ii) 4,4\u2019-\nMethylenebis(2-Isopropyl-6-Methylaniline) [22].  These three components are shown \nschematically in Fig. 1(a).  For comparison, a short-chain version of Digilycidyl Ether (based on \nthe reaction of Bisphenol A with Epichlorohydrin) is shown in Fig. 1(b); it is of note that this \nmolecule exhibits a lower number of active O-based epoxy groups then in the case of TGMDA.  \nBoth of the curing agents employed are polyfunctional aromatic amines, with two reactive amine \ngroups each.  For commercial reasons, little information on the composition of RTM 6 is given in \nRef. [22], beyond the likely proportions in the final epoxy resin of all three elements, namely: 30-\n60 % epoxy (TGMDA), and; 10-40 % of each curing agent.  Further, no information is available in \nthe open literature on any plasticisers employed in this system.  It has been shown previously that \nchanges in structure (e.g. enlarged side groups [7]) can modify the shock response of polymers.  \nConsequently, it seems reasonable to assume that the presence of different epoxy\/curing system \nelements in RTM 6 will lead to a different shock response, particularly in terms of any \nstrengthening behaviour, to other previously studied epoxy resin systems. \n \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n6 \n \nFig. 1  (a) Chemical structure of key constituents of Hexcel\u00ae RTM 6 [22]; (b) Chemical structure \nof the single-repeating-element polymer created by reacting Bisphenol A with Epichlorohydrin \n[21]. \n \nIn previous work on cured RTM 6, the authors of Ref. [14] used a Panametrics 5077PR pulse \nreceiver in the pulse-echo configuration to measure longitudinal and shear wave velocities in cured \nRTM 6 resin.  In combination with the density (measured using a Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas \npycnometer), these wave velocities were subsequently used to calculate the elastic properties of \nRTM 6 shown in Table 1. \nTable 1  Elastic properties of cured RTM 6 resin. \nMaterial \u03c10 (g\/cm3) cL (mm\/\u00b5s) cS (mm\/\u00b5s) cB (mm\/\u00b5s) \u03bd \nRTM 6 1.141 \u00b1 0.001 2.699 1.284 2.256 0.35 \n \nExperimental technique \nPlate impact experiments were employed to investigate the dynamic response of RTM 6 to one \ndimensional loading under a variety of impact conditions.

The target ring\/RTM 6 target assembly shown \nin Fig. 2(a) were arranged so that the entirety of the projectiles surface contacted the target \nsimultaneously.  Inertial confinement meant that strain was confined to the impact axis, with \northogonal elements reduced to zero \u2013 resulting in a planar compressive wave entering the target \nand traversing to the embedded lateral gauge.  Lateral gauge interpretation was based on a \nmodified form of the impedance matching technique.  Developed by Rosenburg and Partom [24], \nthis approach assumed that the strain in a thin (foil) laterally embedded gauge was equivalent to \nthat of the surrounding material.  The approach employed in converting measured changes in \nvoltage across the manganin gauge to lateral stresses also considered both the elastic-plastic \nresponse of the manganin gauge [25] used as well as the pressure dependence of its response at \nstresses below its elastic limit [26].  In two cases longitudinal gauges (type LM-SS-125CH-048, \nmanufactured by Vishay Micro-Measurements & SR-4) were employed either in front or behind \nthe target in addition to the lateral gauge.  Further, one experiment was conducted in which only \nlongitudinal gauges were employed.

In general, Z = \u03c10Us, where \u03c10 is the material \ndensity and Us is the shock velocity. \n \nThe slight difference in magnitude of the resultant Hugoniot stresses in the front\/back surface \nlongitudinal gauges in Fig. 4 is attributed to experimental errors arising from issues such as the \npresence of epoxy layers of unknown thickness (typically <100 \u00b5m).  These errors led to \nuncertainty in the calculated shock \u2013 and therefore particle \u2013 velocities which, as the impedance of \nboth materials depends on the calculated shock\/particle velocities, led to slight errors in the \napplication of Eq. 1.  Nonetheless, and despite the fact that Eq. 1 is primarily designed for use with \nhydrodynamic (fluid) systems, as the difference between the resultant Hugoniot stresses was just \n0.14 GPa \u2013 equivalent to just 3.2 % of the stress quoted in Table 2, the application of Eq. 1 to the \ncomparison of stresses in RTM 6 resin\/PMMA appears justified.  Noise evident at points (a) and \n(b) in Fig. 4 has been observed on such manganin gauge traces previously and appeared electrical \nin nature (e.g. the fast rise time of the shock leads to electrical ringing within the gauge) [14, 27].  \nThe fact that a similar oscillation to that in the rear surface longitudinal gauge at point (b) is \napparent on the front surface gauge immediately behind this trace appears to confirm the \nsupposition that some form of electrical interference is responsible for these features of the two \ntraces.  Rise times for both types of gauge were relatively fast \u2013 for the longitudinal gauges they \nwere typically ca.50 ns, whereas the lateral gauge responded slightly more slowly rising to a \nplateau after ca.75 ns.  The US-uP data points from Table 2 are plotted against the Hugoniot for \nRTM 6 resin previously derived by Hazell et al. [14] in Fig. 5.  Errors in shock velocity (and \ntherefore subsequently calculated particle velocity) were based on the earliest\/latest possible \narrival times at each gauge according to the approach set out in Fig. 4.  For the purpose of \ncomparison, Hugoniot relationships for two different epoxy resins studied by Munson and May \n[13] and Millett et al. [15] are also included.  These two epoxy resins have different compositions \nto RTM 6.  In the case of Munson and May [13], the epoxy considered here was Epon 828 \ncombined with a hardener known as agent Z (see Ref. [13] for further details).  Epon 828 is based \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n11 \non the reaction between Bisphenol A and Epichlorohydrin, with the resultant resin consequently \nhaving the general form shown in Fig. 1(b).  The epoxy considered by Millett et al. [15], however, \nwas more complex; its core elements were a blend of two different epoxy resins \u2013 14-22% 1,4-\nbutanedioldiglycidyl ether and 78-86% an expoy based on the reaction between Bisphenol A and \nEpichlorohydrin (this is known as a modified Bisphenol A \u2013 Epichlorohydrin epoxy [21]).  Both a \nhardener and flexiblazer were employed \u2013 details of both are set out in Ref. [15].  Despite all three \nresins considered possessing different compositions \u2013 and therefore final structures \u2013 it is notable \nthat little difference in US-uP behaviour is apparent.  This ties in well with the previously discussed \nwork by Hazell et al. [14], which indicated that, at least at low pressures, US-uP behaviour was \nindependent of epoxy composition. \nEpon 828-Z; US = 2.64 + 1.66uP (Munson and May [13])\nEpoxy resin; US = 2.58 + 1.47uP (Millett et al.

The larger error bars on the 472 m\/s shot (particularly compared to the 960 m\/s \nshot) arise from the uncertainty in the position of the lateral gauge used to monitor shock arrival, \ncombined with its slower response time.  The good agreement with the previously derived \nHugoniot of the 960 m\/s data point is worth further comment.  As this target comprised two \nlongitudinal gauges with a centrally located lateral gauge embedded within the target material (see \nFig. 4) a number of conclusions may be drawn: \n \n1) It is possible to measure both lateral and longitudinal stresses simultaneously. \n2) The good agreement with the previously derived Hugoniot implies that the centrally \nlocated encapsulated gauge packet had no material effect on the propagation of the shock \nthrough the target.  The relatively sharp rise apparent in the rear surface longitudinal \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n12 \ngauge trace shown in Fig. 4 appears to confirm this analysis as no evidence of \ndissipation\/smearing of the arriving shock is apparent. \n \nThe second point outlined above is reinforced by the high degree of impedance matching which \nexists between different types of epoxy [14]; this implies that an incident shock should see an \neffectively continuous target rather than a target face divided by a gauge encapsulation layer.  In \nthis context, it is interesting to note that the lateral gauge trace in Fig. 4 exhibits some structure \nbehind the shock.  Following an initial overshoot at shock arrival, a slight negative gradient is \napparent.  As discussed previously, it has been suggested that such changes in lateral stress might \nindicate microstructural evolution within the target material [15], although the counter-view that \nshock dispersion in the encapsulation region leads to the observed behaviour has also been put \nforward [16, 17].  The presence of this gradient, combined with the evidence from the surrounding \nlongitudinal gauges of minimum shock dispersal, would therefore seem indicative of measurement \nof a change in material properties behind the shock.  However, the observed gradient in lateral \nstress behind the incident shock is slight compared to the overall shock magnitude; further, the foil \nlongitudinal gauges act as averaging devices over their area and the central encapsulated region of \nthe target is relatively small compared to that area.  Consequently, in order to state categorically \nwhether or not a shock is dissipated\/smeared out within the central encapsulation layer (e.g. by \nsmall differences in impedance between the different epoxy layers employed) further experiments \nincorporating a lateral gauge package based on an epoxy with a substantially different Hugoniot to \nthat of the target epoxy resin would be required. \n \nOverall, the good agreement shown in Fig. 5 between the measured US-uP data points from Table 2 \nand the known Hugoniot for RTM 6 resin gives confidence in the repeatability and consistency of \nthis work and therefore in the lateral gauge responses measured.  It should also be noted that while \nthe Hugoniot presented in Fig. 5 has a linear nature, of the form US = c0 + SuP, other authors such \nas Porter and Gould [28] have  suggested that polymers have a parabolic Hugoniot with a US \nintercept at the zero pressure\/bulk speed of sound.  This is in good agreement with the low position \nof the measured RTM 6 bulk sound speed relative to the principle Hugoniot in Fig. 5.  While there \nare no further significant signs of non-linearity over the particle velocity range studied, it should \nbe stressed that the RTM 6 Hugoniot data here only represents a small range of particle velocities.  \nIt is therefore possible that at higher and lower stresses\/particle velocities some non-linearity may \nbe observed.  Fig. 6 shows the \u03c3X-uP relationship for the three shots detailed in Table 2 where \nlongitudinal stresses were measured.  Quoted longitudinal stress values were averages across the \nHugoniot stress plateau, with errors representing the range of data apparent within the sampling \nregion.  This data is again compared to that from Hazell et al. [14], with the hydrodynamic \nresponse based on the US-uP Hugoniot presented in Fig. 5 (calculated from Eq. 2, with \u03c10 as the \nmeasured density of RTM 6 from Table 1) also included for comparison.  Further, the best-fit (to \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n13 \nexperimental data) response for the bespoke twin-epoxy (both different to RTM 6) resin studied by \nMillett et al. [15] is also included.  Good agreement is observed between the RTM 6 data \nmeasured both here and in Ref. [14], giving further confidence in the experimental approach \nemployed.  In both cases a slight deviation above the hydrodynamic response, discussed further \nelsewhere, is apparent at elevated particle velocities\/impact stresses.  It is notable, however, that \nthe best-fit for the epoxy resin considered in Ref. [15] shows a similar response.  This is taken as \nfurther evidence of the broadly similar response of different epoxy resins, independent of \ncomposition\/structure, at high strain rates previously highlighted by the similarities in the US-uP \nHugoniot equations-of-state identified in Fig. 5. \nPSuUP 0\u03c1=   (2) \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\u03c3\nX\n\/P\n \n(G\nPa\n)\nuP (mm\/\u00b5s)\nRTM 6 data (Hazell et al.

However, as observed previously by Hazell et al. [14], for uP > \nca.0.85 mm\/\u00b5s, an increase in stress above the hydrodynamic pressure occurred.  This implies that \nat these higher particle velocities\/stresses there is an increase in the deviatoric component of stress \n\u2013 namely the maximum value of shear strength, \u03c4MAX.  Similar behaviour was noted by Millett and \nBourne [7] in a study of three different polymers; polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene.  \nAn increase in the deviation from the hydrodynamic response at higher impact velocities was \nnoted in all cases.  Further, the magnitude of this increase was observed to increase with side \ngroup size\/complexity, implying that the observed change in maximum shear strength was linked \nto microstructural changes as the impact stress increased.  In essence, this effect was considered \nanalogous to work hardening in metals, with entanglement\/compression of the polymer chains \nleading to greater maximum shear strengths at higher impact stresses. \n \nAs outlined in Table 2, three other lateral gauge traces in addition to that presented in Fig. 4 were \nalso recorded under a variety of impact conditions.  All four traces, again with their initial rises \nreset to ca.0.5 \u00b5s, are presented in Fig. 7.  For all of the lateral gauge traces shown in Fig. 7, the \ntime taken for the incident stress pulse to ramp up to a maximum amplitude is relatively short at \n<100 ns.  The rise times are observed to increase with impact stress \u2013 with the initial gradient up to \nthe peak stress increasing in magnitude as longitudinal stress increases.  Such a relationship is \napparent in the data presented elsewhere for a bespoke epoxy resin by Millett et al. [15], and is \nlikely a function of the response of the manganin gauge to increased pressure.  Further, in all of \nthese lateral traces, but particularly for \u03c3X \u2265 1.69 GPa, a gradient in the measured lateral stress is \napparent behind the shock before release occurs.   \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0\n\u03c3 Y\n(G\nPa\n)\nTime (\u00b5s)\n193 m\/s, 10mm Cu flyer\n472 m\/s, 5mm Cu flyer\n665 m\/s, 10mm Cu flyer\n960 m\/s, 5mm Cu flyer\n\u03c3X = 4.44 GPa\n\u03c3X = 2.44 GPa (estimated)\n\u03c3X = 1.69 GPa\n\u03c3X = 0.59 GPa (estimated)\n(a) (b)\n \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n15 \nFig. 7  Lateral stress traces following impact of Cu flyers on RTM 6 targets at 193-960 m\/s. \n \nEquation 4 relates longitudinal and lateral stresses to shear strength, \u03c4.  Equation 4, unlike Eq. 3 \nwhich only deals with maximum shear strength, may therefore be used to investigate the behaviour \nof shear strength with time.  From this equation, it is clear that if the longitudinal stress remains \nconstant while the lateral stress decreases then shear strength will increase.  As shown by Fig. 4 \nthis is indeed the case with RTM 6 \u2013 here the longitudinal stress measured by the front surface \ngauge is observed to remain constant while the lateral stress decreases with time. \n \n2\nYX \u03c3\u03c3\u03c4\n\u2212\n=    (4) \n \nWhile similar gradients in lateral stress behind the shock to those highlighted in Fig. 7 were \nobserved in the epoxy resin studied by Millett et al. [15], as previously highlighted, Winter and \nHarris [16] have recently suggested that a modification of the interpretation of lateral gauge \nresults, and consequently any deduced changes in shear strength, is required.  The propagation of \nshocks through (a) a so-called matrix material, and (b) a matrix material with a central fluid layer \ndesigned to simulate an encapsulated gauge, was simulated.  The presence of a fluid layer was \nshown to significantly modify the shock front due to different fluid layer\/matrix velocities.  A \nfaster shock velocity in the fluid layer was found to result in a continual rise in lateral gauge stress \nafter shock arrival, while a faster matrix shock front led to an initial ramp to a peak followed by a \nsteady decrease in magnitude behind the front.  The decrease in lateral stress behind the shock \napparent in Fig. 7 would be consistent with the models developed by Winter and Harris [16] and \nWinter et al. [17] if it is assumed that the shock moves more slowly in the central encapsulation \nlayer than in the RTM 6 matrix.  However, as shown in Fig. 5\/Refs. [13-15], the shock velocity (at \na given particle velocity) in different epoxy resins is essentially constant.  Therefore, while care \nmust be taken in interpretation of lateral gauge traces, in this case similar shock velocities in the \nRTM 6\/gauge encapsulation mean that dispersion of the shock is unlikely to occur.  Consequently, \nthe observed gradients in lateral stress behind the shock front in Fig. 7 are most likely a real \nmaterial response rather than an artefact caused by the presence of the lateral gauge. \n \nThe change in gradient of the lateral stress behind the shock, \u2206\u03c3Y, has been measured for all four \ncases in Fig. 7.  In each case the change in lateral stress was measured from a point on the curve \nafter the initial response of the gauge up to a position just before the release caught up with the \nshock \u2013 e.g. from point (a) to point (b) for the \u03c3X = 4.44 GPa case.  Errors are included based on \nthe range of possible gradients which could be measured between points (a) and (b) based on the \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n16 \nscatter of the experimental data at these two sampling positions.

[15] is observed to increase in magnitude \nwith impact stress.  This relationship holds even when the fact that the errors in the experimental \ndata in Fig. 8 also increase with impact stress is allowed for (this increase in the magnitude of \nexperimental errors is a reflection of the increased noise in the higher impact stress lateral gauge \ntraces in Fig. 7).  Taking into account both the relationship between longitudinal and lateral stress \nand shear strength set out in Eq. 4 and the fact, already highlighted, that as shown in Fig. 4, the \nlongitudinal Hugoniot stress tends to stay constant behind the shock, several observations may be \ndrawn from Fig. 8: (1) up to a longitudinal impact stress of ca.1.5 GPa there is no significant \nchange in lateral stress behind the shock \u2013 implying that no change in shear strength is occurring; \n(2) beyond ca.1.5 GPa a change in lateral stress occurs behind the shock, which given its \nmagnitude implies that the resin is strengthening with time, and; (3) the magnitude of the change \nin lateral stress observed for \u03c3X > ca.1.5 GPa increases with impact velocity.  This latter point \nimplies that the strengthening mechanism is continuing to act up to at least 3.5 GPa.  Again, this \nstrengthening mechanism is likely to be linked to compression of the polymer chains at different \nimpact velocities. \n \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n17 \nIt is also worth noting that, while a similar response occurs for both the epoxy resins in Fig. 8, the \nmagnitude of -\u2206\u03c3Y is substantially less (for a given value of \u03c3X) with the RTM 6 experimental data \nthan for the different, bespoke, twin-epoxy resin from Millett et al. [15].  Lateral gauge type and \nthe experimental technique employed were essentially identical in both sets of experiments.  \nFurther, as demonstrated here and elsewhere (e.g. Figs. 4 and 5\/Ref. [14]), different epoxy resins \ntend to exhibit relatively similar Hugoniot equations-of-state; this means that for a given impact \nstress shock velocities will be broadly similar.  Consequently, the difference in the shear strength \nbehaviour for the two different resins implied by Fig. 8 suggests that lateral gauges are, at least in \npart, measuring an inherent physical response within the target material.  Physically, this \ndifference in material properties is most likely linked to the resin compositions.  As previously set \nout, the epoxy resin investigated by Millett et al. [15] was a modified Bisphenol A \u2013 \nEpichlorohydrin epoxy incorporating two different epoxies.  Such modifications are designed to \nincrease cross-linking over those resins (such as RTM 6) which only incorporate a single epoxy.  \nConsequently, it is reasonable to attribute the enhanced strengthening behind the shock observed \nin this epoxy over RTM 6 to the increased resistance to compression of the polymer chains caused \nby increased cross-linking.  This result therefore suggests that changes in lateral stress gradient \nbehind the shock measured by manganin stress gauges are not entirely attributable to the \ndispersion of the incident shock by the central encapsulating layer as suggested in Refs. [16] and \n[17].  Instead, given the experimental evidence of near and far-field effects when a central \nencapsulated region is present (as demonstrated by Winter at al. [17]), a combination\/superposition \nof two factors seems the most likely explanation for the observed lateral gauge behaviour shown in \nFig. 7.  These factors are: (a) physical changes in the target behind the shock, and; (b) the presence \nof the encapsulated stress gauge within the centre of the target acting to modify the shock front \nand therefore the response of the embedded gauge. \n \nThe shear strengths at the beginning\/end of the shock (e.g. the locations indicated by points (a) and \n(b) in Fig. 7 for \u03c3X = 4.44 GPa), calculated from the data presented in Table 2 according to Eq. 4 \nare plotted against longitudinal impact stress in Fig. 9 (an approach previously employed \nelsewhere, e.g. [27, 29]).  It is worth noting that the average shear strength would, in each case, lie \napproximately halfway between these two values.  Errors in shear strength were derived from the \nexperimental errors in \u03c3X and \u03c3Y \u2013 with errors in the \u03c3X components assumed to be \u00b15 % where no \nlongitudinal gauge was employed (e.g. where a value based on the Hugoniot relationship presented \nin Fig. 6 was used).  The predicted isotropic elastic response of RTM 6 based on Eq. 5 is also \nincluded [15, 27, 29].  This elastic response depends on both the Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd and the impact \nstress.  Further, average shear strength data derived in the same manner (e.g. according to Eq. 4) \nfor the bespoke two-element epoxy considered by Millett et al. in Ref.

The gradual movement of the data \npoints from locations (a) and (b) in Fig. 7 below the elastic prediction with increasing stress \nindicates that at higher impact stresses a plastic deformation mechanism is active.  It is notable that \nthe data from Ref. [15] falls below both sets of data for RTM 6.  This is in good agreement with \nthe observed greater gradient in lateral stress behind the shock illustrated in Fig. 8 and implies that \nthe twin-epoxy bespoke resin employed by Millett et al. [15] undergoes greater strengthening \nbehind the shock then RTM 6.  As before, this is most likely a result of the greater cross-linking \n(and therefore resistance to compression) which will be present in a twin versus single epoxy resin \nsystem.  As the movement of data below the elastic prediction represents plastic deformation, it \nfollows that if a line of best fit were passed through the two sets of data from locations (a) and (b), \nthe Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) of RTM 6 should be represented by the point of departure of \nthese lines from the elastic response.  While not included for clarity, best-fit lines through the data \nfrom points (a) and (b) would intercept the elastic prediction at \u03c3X values of 0.84 and 0.91 GPa and \n2\u03c4 values of 0.39 and 0.42 GPa respectively.  This would give an average HEL of 0.88 \u00b1 0.04 GPa.  \nThe fact that the RTM 6 data point\/associated error bars for \u03c3X = 0.59 GPa lie just above the \nelastic response should also be highlighted.  This is likely attributable to the requirement to \nestimate both \u03c3X and the associated errors in this case (see Table 2).  As shown in Fig. 6, the \u03c3X-uP \nHugoniot is ill-defined at lower impact stresses; consequently, it might be expected that the errors \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n19 \non estimated values of \u03c3X would be substantially greater at lower stresses.  Nevertheless, the \nbroadly linear variation in shear strength with impact stress shown in Fig. 9 gives confidence in \nthe overall validity of this approach.  For comparison, Millett et al. [15] calculated the HEL of a \nbespoke epoxy resin using the same technique.  They found a value of ~0.6 GPa and, additionally, \nby reviewing previous work by Barker and Hollenbach [6], suggested a HEL for PMMA of ~0.9 \nGPa.  This value was of the same order of magnitude as that measured by Barker and Hollenback \n[6] themselves (of 0.7 GPa) for PMMA.  This result implies that the method used here, and \ntherefore the HEL of ca.0.88 GPa derived in this work for RTM 6, is also of the correct order of \nmagnitude.  Additionally, the tendency of the points sampled at location (b) in Fig. 7 to stray \nbelow those from location (a) with increasing impact stress in Fig. 9 represents further evidence of \nthe previously discussed increase in shear strength behind the shock.  However, in all cases the \nerror bars for the data points from both locations overlap meaning that there is insufficient spatial \nseparation of the data points to quantify this effect. \n \nConclusions \nThe dynamic response of the commercially important RTM 6 resin has been investigated using \nplate impact experiments in the impact velocity regime 80-960 m\/s.  Both longitudinal and lateral \ngauges were employed and results were compared to the literature.  A linear US-uP Hugoniot was \nconfirmed, in line with data from the literature for RTM 6, with no evidence of any non-linearity \nat lower particle velocities as observed elsewhere for the thermoplastic PMMA.  The derived \u03c3X-\nuP Hugoniot evidenced an increase in longitudinal stress above the hydrodynamic response at \nelevated particle velocities.  This was interpreted as an increase in maximum shear strength as the \nimpact velocity increased, attributed to increased resistance to compression due to polymer chain \ncompression.  With both the US-uP and \u03c3X-uP Hugoniot relationships, comparison to data from the \nliterature showed that the equations-of-state were similar for epoxy resins with different \ncompositions; a result expected based on previous work by some of the authors of this paper. \n \nLateral gauge traces showed a fast rise, followed by an overshoot and than a plateau before \nreleases from the flyer plate ended the 1D behaviour at the gauge.  A gradient in the recorded \nlateral stress histories following shock arrival was apparent for \u03c3X > 1.5 GPa and was tentatively \ninterpreted as an increase in shear strength behind the shock.  While small, this effect appeared \nmeasurable and consequently implied that a hardening mechanism \u2013 again likely linked to polymer \nchain compression \u2013 was in operation behind the shock for impact stresses >1.5 GPa.  Comparison \nof the magnitude of the lateral stress gradient behind the shock in RTM 6 for different impact \nstresses was made to data for a bespoke twin-epoxy resin from the literature.  Despite the similar \nUS-uP Hugoniot relationships, these two different resins showed substantial differences in the \nmagnitude of the gradient in lateral stress behind the shock.  For example, for impact stresses of \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n20 \n3.0-4.5 GPa, a >100 % difference in lateral gradient magnitude was apparent.  A similar (but less \nmarked) difference was also apparent when the variation of shear strength with impact stress was \nconsidered.  Shear strengths within RTM 6 were determined by comparing recorded\/calculated \nlongitudinal and lateral stresses.  The embedded lateral gauges allowed direct monitoring of \nchanges in shear strength behind the shock.  By calculating shear strengths at both the beginning \nand end of lateral stress plateaus it proved possible to quantify the observed increase in shear \nstrength in the region behind the shock.  Comparison of these results was again made to similarly \nderived data for a bespoke twin-epoxy resin from the literature (in this case with lateral stresses \njust taken from a point immediately following shock arrival rather than two locations).  In both \ncases, maximum shear strength was observed to increase in magnitude with impact velocity.  This \nconfirmed the relationship suggested by both the derived RTM 6 and literature-based twin-epoxy \n\u03c3X-uP Hugoniot\u2019s, where \u03c3X was observed to trend above the predicted elastic response at higher \nparticle velocities.  This behaviour was attributed to a mechanism analogous to \u201chardening\u201d in \nmetals involving increased entanglement\/compression of the polymer chains at higher impact \nstresses leading to greater resistance to subsequent compression.  The difference in both lateral \nstress gradient behind the shock\/variation of shear strength with impact stress for RTM 6 and the \ntwin-epoxy resin considered from the literature was attributed to the different chemical structures \nof the two epoxies.  The twin-epoxy exhibited a larger gradient in lateral stress behind the incident \nshock front\/greater strengthening then the RTM 6, presumably due to greater internal cross-linking \nleading to enhanced resistance to compression.  Essentially, it is suggested that the same polymer-\nchain-compression mechanism identified above also accounts for the difference in behaviour \nbetween these two resins. \n \nRecent work has suggested that the response of lateral gauges behind the shock is, at least initially, \nattributable to the composite nature of the gauge package\/target assembly, with the smearing of the \nincident shock across both elements leading to the observed changes in gradient.  However, given \nthe otherwise similar nature of the two epoxy resins considered here (particularly the similar US-uP \nHugoniot relationships, which imply similar shock velocities for a given impact stress), the \nobserved differences in behaviour behind the shock were taken to imply that the lateral gauges \nwere detecting changes in a physical material property within the target material.  Additionally, the \nresults of a test undertaken with both a central embedded lateral gauge and front\/rear longitudinal \ngauges (where no evidence of shock modification was noted at the rear surface) appeared to \nprovide further evidence that shock dispersal in the encapsulated lateral gauge package was \nminimal.  While the significance of this result was initially qualified, when considered in light of \nthe different lateral gauge responses in otherwise similar resins, it appears to back the conclusion \nthat embedded lateral gauges are picking up some kind of material response.  Consequently, this \nwork suggests that in epoxies observed changes in lateral manganin gauge response behind the \nshock front may be primarily attributed to a change in material properties. \n \nAccepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Science in August 2009; subsequently \npublished in Vol. 44, No. 22, pp. 6187-6198 (2009). \n21 \nShear strength data also allowed determination of the HEL of Hexcel\u00ae RTM 6; the intercepts \nbetween the two experimental data sets and the elastic best-fit yielded an estimate of 0.88 \u00b1 0.04 \nGPa.  This result was of a similar order of magnitude to data from the literature for both PMMA \nand a twin-epoxy resin system which demonstrated similar US-uP\/\u03c3X-uP Hugoniot responses. \n \nOverall, knowledge of the dynamic response of the important epoxy resin Hexcel\u00ae RTM 6 has \nbeen extended to regimes\/strain rates beyond the data previously available in the literature.  \nEvidence of strengthening both with increased impact stress and behind the shock has been found \nand tentatively linked to resistance to compression of polymer chains.  By comparison to data from \nthe literature, this result has been used to enhance the validity of the embedded lateral gauge \ntechnique with regards to the measurement of physical target material properties behind the shock.  \nHowever, further work will be required to determine the extent of any target\/gauge package \ngeometrical effects on embedded lateral gauge response.  Good agreement between the derived \nHugoniot relationships and the identified RTM 6 HEL with data for similar polymers from the \nliterature creates a reasonable degree of confidence in the validity of these results. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank Mr Steven Mortimer of Hexcel, Duxford, UK, for supplying the cured \nresin samples.
