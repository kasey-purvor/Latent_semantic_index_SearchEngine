He liked to categorize and pigeon-hole, but invariably with the \nawareness that all systems and categories only work on their own terms, that the \nsystematizer is implicated in his creations, that consciousness, while freeing us to \nexplain ourselves to ourselves and to each other, also imprisons us in the explanations \nwe have framed. There can be no one to stand outside and watch (except God). Hence \nthe provisionality, audible in all his poetry if carefully listened to, of the various \nsystems of belief he entertained one after the other, Freudian, Marxist, liberal \nhumanist, even and finally Christian \u2013 although this last came to seem to Auden the \none that gave him the most room to manoeuvre. Such freedom within restraint \ncharacterizes also, and especially, Auden\u2019s attitude to poetry. Poetic form may be \narbitrary, but within its limits and limitations it permits, or rather induces, quest and \ndiscovery, although the object of discovery, especially for the Christian Auden, is \nalways out of reach. The limits of poetry make us aware of what lies beyond, as he \nwrote in \u201cUn Homme d\u2019Esprit\u201d: \u201cThe formal restrictions of poetry teach us that the \nthoughts which arise from our needs, feelings, and experiences are only a small part \nof the thoughts of which we are capable\u201d (F&A: 364). Poetry came to be for Auden \nthe most serious game of homo ludens. His \u201cOde to Terminus\u201d thanks the god of \nlimits \u201cfor giving us games and grammar and metres\u201d. But disaster happens when one \nsystem encroaches on another, the artistic on the political, say: in \u201cThe Poet and The \nCity\u201d Auden argued that a \u201csociety which was really like a good poem, embodying \nthe aesthetic virtues of beauty, order, economy and subordination of detail to the \n whole\u201d would be a horrific dictatorship practising brutal eugenics, and gave a tongue-\nin-cheek demonstration of the petty-tyrant poet\u2019s method of composition, his verbal \n\u201cselective breeding\u201d and \u201cextermination\u201d, the dictatorial techniques of re-phrasing, \ntransposition and cuts (DH: 85). \u201cPoetry makes nothing happen\u201d, he famously wrote \nin 1939, but he also wrote in the same poem that it is a \u201cway of happening\u201d; and even, \nperhaps especially, in the face of his espousal of Christianity in 1940, he needed to \ndemonstrate, to himself as much as to his readers, the nature and importance of \npoetry\u2019s particular way of happening.  \nAuden\u2019s account of his conversion reveals that he knew he had always needed \nto entertain systems. With some condescension he writes that the \u201cvarious \n\u2018kerygmas\u2019\u201d \u2013 preachings \u2013 of Blake, Lawrence, Freud and Marx taken up by him and \nhis contemporaries in the 1930\u2019s, \u201cwere all Christian heresies\u201d.  At least they were all \nbased on the religious belief that \u201cmatter, the natural order, is real and redeemable \u2026 \nand historical time is real and significant\u201d.1 Psychoanalysis, Freudianism, Marxism, \nare all partial and monistic explanations, whereas Christianity is complete. He quoted \napprovingly Nietzsche\u2019s view of Christianity as \u201ca system, a view of things, \nconsistently thought out and complete. If we break out of it a fundamental idea, the \nbelief in God, we thereby break the whole into pieces.\u201d2 Christianity subsumes all \nother systems; it is the system to end all systems. This way of thinking reverses even \nas it is consistent with earlier Auden, who, in an essay called \u201cThe Good Life\u201d \npublished in 1935, attempted to synthesize religious, scientific, philosophical and \npolitical systems, and concluded by finding Christianity wanting in comparison with \nthe other systems when faced with the challenges of the modern world. One can \nimagine an older Auden with the benefit of hindsight finding the seeds of his religious \nconversion in the questions posed in the essay, \u201cIf our desires are mutually \n incompatible, which are we to choose? i.e. what ought we to desire and do, and what \nought we not to desire and do?\u201d3 These questions were to be given a Kierkegaardian \nChristian-existentialist answer, where that \u201cought\u201d becomes a Christian imperative, \nand our freedom to choose an unknowing \u201cleap of faith\u201d. So when Humphrey \nCarpenter emphasizes the rationality behind Auden\u2019s religious beliefs, writing that his \n\u201cconversion had apparently been an exclusively intellectual process rather than a \nspiritual experience\u201d, he is pointing to a deep-seated tendency that had been with \nAuden from early on (Carpenter: 298). That rationality eventually involved the \nrecognition that Christianity paradoxically requires the exhaustion of all reasonable \nexplanations and a leap of faith into the unknown and unreasonable.  \nHence New Year Letter, which reasons its way towards Christianity, quotes St \nAnselm\u2019s \u201ccredo ut intelligam\u201d, \u201cI believe in order that I may understand\u201d (NYL:  \nline 422), for absolute and irrational belief permits, because it goes beyond, the \nexercise and play of that most human of faculties, the reason that accompanies \nunderstanding. Characteristically, Auden \u201cthe double man\u201d (the work\u2019s original, \nAmerican, title), the categorizer and qualifier who sees himself in the mirror and on \nthe other side of every argument, must use reason to get beyond reason. Moreover at \nthis time (the poem was written between January and April 1940) the internal struggle \nwas urgent, for Hitler\u2019s domination of Europe and the start of war signalled for Auden \nthe failure of reason, the stand-by of the liberal humanist. As he was to remember \nsixteen years later, \u201cthe liberal humanism of the past had failed to produce the \nuniversal peace and prosperity it promised, failed even to prevent a World War.\u201d \n(Canterbury Pilgrims: 40) And in 1940 he wrote that \u201cThe whole trend of liberal \nthought \u2026 has been to undermine faith in the absolute\u201d by trying \u201cto make reason the \njudge\u201d, an argument he read in Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s book An Interpretation of \n Christian Ethics (1936) and which must have weighed heavily on an intellect as active \nas Auden\u2019s.4  \n\u201cHistorical time is real and significant\u201d for Auden because the Christian\u2019s \nbelief in \u201ca personal God implies that the relation of every human being to Him is \nunique and historical\u201d, as he wrote in Canterbury Pilgrims (32). So History must be \nschematised to see where I am now, at this moment in History. One statement in \u201cThe \nGood Life\u201d which the Christian Auden would have found proleptic acknowledges the \npoint of view that the \u201cexistence [of evil desires] in us is to be explained by the Fall \u2013 \nan inherited defect in our nature, which, since God is good, must be attributed to a \nvolitional act of rebellion at some period of human development\u201d (34-5). As \nCarpenter points out, this view of the Christian doctrine of the Fall as \u201ca \nrepresentation of a fact of human psychology\u201d became characteristic of Auden\u2019s \nreligious thought: he saw the Fall \u201cas a symbol of the point in history where Man \ndeveloped self-consciousness and became aware of the possibility of freedom and \nautonomy\u201d (Carpenter: 299) Thus New Year Letter focuses in on this central and \ndistinguishing fact, that \u201cMan faulted into consciousness\u201d (line 1110), that alone of all \ncreation we know who we are and what we are doing, knowledge which is the ground \nof our freedom and our responsibility to choose. The poem thus gives a Christian \ntwist to the existentialism of the sonnet sequence \u201cIn Time of War\u201d from Journey to a \nWar (1939), with its evolutionary version of History to the point where we are \u201cnow\u201d \n(\u201cYes, we are going to suffer, now\u201d, sonnet XIV; \u201cWhere life is evil now\u201d, sonnet \nXVI), when \u201cWe live in freedom by necessity\u201d (sonnet XXVII), a phrase which \nconjures up in an intriguing blend of elegy and expectancy Engels\u2019s dictum, \u201cfreedom \nis the knowledge of necessity\u201d. From here the way for Auden led to Kierkegaard: \u201cAs \na spirit, a conscious person endowed with free will, every man has, through faith and \n grace, a unique \u2018existential\u2019 relation to God, and few since St. Augustine have \ndescribed this relation more profoundly than Kierkegaard.\u201d Canterbury Pilgrims, from \nwhich this derives (41-2), explains that one reason for the attraction of Kierkegaard \n(other reasons, not unrelated, were his humour and his \u201ctalent \u2026 of making \nChristianity sound bohemian\u201d) was the capaciousness and generosity, the \nparadoxically unsystematic nature of his system, for it comprehends all that makes us \nhuman. Kierkegaard\u2019s view of humanity as made up of conscious beings perpetually \nobliged to exercise their free will to choose from an infinity of foreseeable \npossibilities, means that each individual presents his unique case.  \nBut for Auden poetry\u2019s way of happening cannot be existential, for it deals in \nthings completed, not things foreseeable; it is art, not life: \nArt in intention is mimesis \nBut, realized, the resemblance ceases; \nArt is not life, and cannot be \nA midwife to society, \nFor art is a fait accompli.  (NYL, lines 76-80) \nThese lines occur near the start of New Year Letter in the context of contemporary \nNazi anarchy, and the \u201ctask\u201d, both in \u201cArt and Life\u201d is to \u201cset in order\u201d (lines 56-8). \n\u201cMidwife to society\u201d flirts with a jocularly dismissive tone, raising the question of \nwhether such a fate for poetry is desirable, for the orders of art are potentially \ndangerous in the ways described in \u201cThe Poet and the City\u201d. But the poet never allows \nhimself to give up on the possibility of poetry\u2019s efficacy, and characteristically the \nopposed view is allowed a sly look-in.  In the parabolic model of poetry which this \nverse-paragraph goes on to describe, \u201cunique events that once took place\u201d, when used \nin a poem, change into \n An abstract model of events \nDerived from dead experience, \nAnd each life must itself decide \nTo what and how it be applied.   (lines 95-8) \nThe style of New Year Letter sounds reasonable, but the reasoning is often slippery. \nHere the poet holds his cards close to his chest with \u201cAnd\u201d: the necessity thus to \n\u201cdecide\u201d shows that poetry is either ethically neutral, or that it is ethically invigorating \nsince we are compelled to exercise choice. Substituting \u201cBut\u201d for \u201cAnd\u201d would tend \nto tip the balance in favour of the first alternative, emphasizing the gap between art \nand life: \u201cbut it is up to us as to how to apply art\u2019s model to life\u201d, rather than \u201cand, as \na consequence, we are able to apply\u201d. Poetry reads us as we read it. It becomes a \nparable of our freedom to choose, of our moral being.  \nHow we receive poetry depends on our predisposition. Thus in New Year \nLetter the devil has \u201cno positive existence\u201d: as our self-projection and double agent he \nis only our \u201crecurrent state \/ Of fear and faithlessness and hate\u201d (lines 414-16). As \nsuch he does not tell lies \u201cBut half-truths we can synthesize: \/ So, hidden in his hocus-\npocus, \/ There lies the gift of double focus.\u201d (lines 826-9) As Stan Smith points out, \nAuden is here \u201cturning his favourite trick on the word \u2018lies\u2019, changing its grammatical \nfunction from noun to verb as its semantic function too is converted from language to \nphysical position.\u201d5 That change artfully demonstrates how by indirections we may, \nso the poet hopes, find directions out: by tempting us with half-truths the devil \npresents us with the possibility of truth. Thus poetry is like a \u201cmagic lamp\u201d, \u201cutterly \nimpractical, \/ Yet, if Aladdin use it right, \/ Can be a sesame to light.\u201d (lines 830-4) \nThe utter impracticality of poetry has its guiltily negative aspect (\u201cFor poetry makes \nnothing happen\u201d), but not being a midwife to society may not be such a bad thing if it \n can be a doorway to the \u201clight\u201d beyond, a means of leaping. A note to these lines \nintimates this tension between guilty aesthetic delight and ethical aspiration, its \noptative mood: \u201cThe Devil, indeed, is the father of Poetry, for poetry might be defined \nas the clear expression of mixed feelings. The Poetic mood is never indicative.\u201d The \nsynthesizing poetic intelligence has to deal with \u201cmixed feelings\u201d, but, as the lines of \npoetry with which the note ends say, \u201cThe Truth is one and incapable of self-\ncontradiction; \/ All knowledge that conflicts with itself is Poetic Fiction\u201d (NYL: 119). \nSomething that is \u201cincapable of self-contradiction\u201d is not the stuff of poetry, which \nneeds the \u201chalf-truths we can synthesize\u201d for its very existence. There is no room here \nfor something called Poetic Truth: all poetry is by definition fiction. \nAesthetic delight is so dominant in a poem like \u201cLeap Before You Look\u201d that \nits intensely mixed feelings risk going unnoticed. But then its manner is beguilingly \npolite, as if in fear of offending. The poem plays around with language in a self-\nconsciously formal manner, the delight in its own procedures affecting the tone \nunsettlingly. The greater the demands on the poet of its formal game, the smaller the \ndemands on the reader, or so it seems, for its expression is deceptively clear. A \nseductively deliberate fait accompli, its message is that lack of deliberation is the \norder of the day. Its ludic arena is highly restricted, a fact that makes the proposed \nleap all the riskier. John Fuller, pointing out the poem\u2019s \u201cingeniously\u201d artful \u201cpseudo-\nvillanelle\u201d form, argues that \u201csuch technical shadow-boxing\u201d gives the poem a \u201csense \nof circumspection [which] nicely underlines the \u2018danger\u2019 which is the subject of the \npoem\u201d. Fuller also writes that the subject of the poem is \u201cthe risk involved in making \nthe existential choice of life, more specifically the suggestion that Kallman might \nfollow him in becoming a Christian.\u201d (Fuller 1998: 397). That circumspection takes \nthe form of a deference (\u201cMuch can be said for social savoir-faire\u201d) which, it \n proposes, must be put at risk; and beneath the social niceties is an awesome \nKierkegaardian \u201csolitude ten thousand fathoms deep [which] \/ Sustains the bed on \nwhich we lie, my dear.\u201d6 The social savoir-faire of this address knows that it is \nplaying artfully with its (poetic) audience, those being wooed to take the recklessly \nunsociable leap, even as it contemplates the loneliness where \u201cno one is watching\u201d \nand where questions of audience are beside the point. The cosily friendly \u201cmy dear\u201d \nplays with and off those friendless fathoms with artfully polite circumspection. The \npoem sounds like an invitation expecting circumspectly polite resistance (and \nKallman never did accept the invitation).7  \nPoetry is time-ridden, it belongs to History and our fallen condition, but it can \nmake us, within its enclosed arenas, its parables, conscious of the timeless. The \n\u201cCoda\u201d to \u201cArchaeology\u201d, one of the last poems Auden wrote, concludes with the \nassertion that \u201cHistory \/ is nothing to vaunt of\u201d since it is \u201cmade \u2026 by the criminal in \nus\u201d, whereas \u201cgoodness is timeless\u201d. Just as poetry is born of our devilish mixed \nfeelings, so History is the child of \u201cthe criminal in us\u201d. Only in myths and rites, we \nhave just been told, can we escape our time-bound individuality (\u201cOnly in rites \/ can \nwe renounce our oddities \/ and be truly entired\u201d), the pre-eminent instance being the \n\u201cabominable\u201d rite of the crucifixion. That rite, with its attendant criminal in us, Auden \ncontemplated at length in \u201cHorae Canonicae\u201d. The rest of this chapter will be devoted \nto this sequence, for the crucifixion presented the poet with a challenge that focused \nhis mixed and guilty feelings about the role of poetry.8  \nIn his commonplace book A Certain World Auden insists on the impossibility \nof Good Friday as a subject for poetry: \u201cChristmas and Easter can be subjects for \npoetry, but Good Friday, like Auschwitz, cannot. The reality is so horrible \u2026. Poems \nabout Good Friday have, of course, been written, but none of them will do.\u201d He goes \n on to sketch in an argument that underpins the progress of \u201cHorae Canonicae\u201d: \u201cJust \nas we were all, potentially, in Adam when he fell\u201d \u2013 which is the idea motivating the \nfirst poem, \u201cPrime\u201d \u2013 \u201cso we were all, potentially, in Jerusalem on that first Good \nFriday\u201d \u2013 which is the motive for \u201cTerce\u201d and \u201cSext\u201d. The puzzle behind the whole \nsequence, and its central poem \u201cNones\u201d in particular, is indicated when Auden goes \non to imagine himself as a witness to the crucifixion, \u201ca Hellenized Jew from \nAlexandria visiting an intellectual friend\u201d; and \u201caverting my eyes from the \ndisagreeable spectacle, I resume our fascinating discussion about the nature of the \nTrue, the Good, and the Beautiful\u201d (ACW: 168-9). The poetry of \u201cHorae Canonicae\u201d \nspends its time averting its eyes from the disagreeable spectacle, elaborately \ncircumventing the subject. At the heart of the sequence is the intractability of the \ncrucifixion as a subject for poetry: its meaning is that it cannot get at the meaning. \nAnd the larger implication is that this is what happens every day of our lives: we do \nnot, we cannot because it is \u201cso horrible\u201d, think about Christ\u2019s martyrdom, even \nthough, or indeed because, it informs everything we do and are. That is why Auden \ncalled the sequence \u201ca series of secular poems based on the Office\u201d (emphasis \nadded),9 because the focus is the life lived (and not lived) in the shadow of, and \nnecessarily despite, the Cross.  \nIn approaching the events of the crucifixion in relation to the daily life of the \nindividual with his temporal \u201coddities\u201d and to mankind\u2019s guilt and suffering, \u201cHorae \nCanonicae\u201d takes its cue from that pre-conversion poem \u201cabout suffering\u201d, \u201cMus\u00e9e \ndes Beaux Arts\u201d, turning it, with the benefit of hindsight, into a proleptically Christian \npoem. Fuller has pointed out the \u201crich double meaning\u201d in this poem\u2019s first word, \u201cfor \nit is Breugel\u2019s very circuitousness of approach (\u2018about\u2019 in a different sense) that \nAuden is interested in \u2026. In Breugel\u2019s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, the painter \n presents a momentous event in a world of diurnal unconcern\u201d (Fuller: 266).10 \nLikewise Auden approaches his subject circuitously, for before his poem gets round \nto mentioning the Breugel painting in line 14, it notes, as if in passing, the world\u2019s \nunconcern both at \u201cthe miraculous birth\u201d (the word \u201cChrist\u201d being studiedly \ncircumvented) and, almost in the same breath, at the crucifixion: \u201cThey never forgot \/ \nThat even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course \/ Anyhow in a corner\u2026.\u201d  The \nwhole matter of the Incarnation passed barely noticed on the stage of History. \u201cHorae \nCanonicae\u201d, then, is \u201cabout\u201d the crucifixion in the same way that \u201cMus\u00e9e des Beaux \nArts\u201d is \u201cabout suffering\u201d. Running its course anyhow in a corner is how the dreadful \nmartyrdom is presented in the sequence, or, rather, extensively circumvented among a \nworld of richly elaborated diurnal unconcern. As ever, Auden as entertainer of \nsystems shadows the sequence, for the Offices of the canonical hours along with \nmany other tables of categories, either borrowed or invented (historical, theological, \nanthropological, social, physiological, personal), provided the poet with systems to be \nimaginatively exploited, affording him the opportunity to exercise his fallen nature, \nthe criminal in him, to give the devilish father of poetry his due.11 This \u201cPoetic \nFiction\u201d is \u201cknowledge\u201d that knowingly, and often with surprising humour, \u201cconflicts \nwith itself\u201d. It is also a quiet tour-de-force, a literary performance that knows it is \nperforming, though never ostentatiously so. \nThe sequence confesses abundantly to feelings of guilt, of forgiveness, of the \npossibility of redemption, without coming across as \u201cconfessional\u201d. \u201cPrime\u201d achieves \nthis effect by hauntingly enacting the individual\u2019s waking from sleep \u2013 in so doing \nintimating Auden\u2019s notion of the Fall as a psychological fact, \u201cMan fault[ing] into \nconsciousness\u201d \u2013 in a mysterious lapse into consciousness, where the acting subject of \nthe seductively welcoming opening adverbs is at first uncertain: \u201cSimultaneously, as \n soundlessly, \/ Spontaneously, suddenly \/ As, at the vaunt of the dawn\u2026\u201d. Does the \nsecond \u201cas\u201d have the same function as the first; is one perhaps comparative, the other \ntemporal? With the \u201cdawning\u201d of consciousness comes the self\u2019s implication in and \nresistance to historical guilt and responsibility, to the criminal in us. History may be \n\u201cnothing to vaunt of\u201d (\u201cArchaeology\u201d), but here the self is caught in the act of \nvaunting before it has become conscious enough to know better, \u201cat the vaunt of the \ndawn\u201d. That phrase typifies the artful artlessness of \u201cPrime\u201d. The internal rhyming \nand assonance, the patterns of sound weaving through each of the three long sentences \nthat form the poem\u2019s three stanzas, give an air of automatic writing, homo ludens at \nhis most playful, appropriate to the re-enactment of an everyman consciousness \nlighting out at its innocent dawn: \u201cand I \/ The Adam sinless in our beginning\u201d. That \nphrase sounds like an innocent jingle, though the echo of \u201csinless\u201d in \u201cbeginning\u201d \nholds what is in store. The fortuitousness of this art is part of our (fallen) humanity, is \nthe implication, one to be spelt out in \u201cNones\u201d, where the poet happens upon the \nchanciness of the rhyme \u201cwill\u201d and \u201ckill\u201d. \u201cHoly this moment, wholly in the right\u201d: \none chime, happy at the start of the second stanza, plays off against another, not so \nhappy, at the end of the poem, where the poet\u2019s \u201cname \/ Stands for my historical share \nof care\u201d. Individuation, the decline from the general Adam to the particular named \nperson, brings with it consciousness of self and other, of individual and society, of \ninherited guilt and responsibility, the world of time, the \u201cliving\u201d and the \u201cdying\u201d, of \nall that makes us human.  \nFrom the poet\u2019s Christian perspective this is to state the obvious \u2013 \u201cParadise \/ \nLost of course\u201d \u2013 but the triumph of the poem has been to create a simulacrum of time \nsuspended, a timeless now, this holy moment, before the onset of History and being in \ntime. Thus in the first stanza the sense of timelessness comes in large part from the \n spiralling syntax, those suspended \u201cas\u201d adverbs giving way to clauses that take in \neven as they pass over what is to come, what has been left behind, and, disarmingly, \nwhat is, or is to become, the sequence\u2019s central subject, intimated with circuitously \nironic understatement as \u201can historical mistake\u201d, a way of putting it that conjures up \nan aversion \u201cfrom the disagreeable spectacle\u201d. Not until the stanza\u2019s end do we arrive \nat the main clause, and the moment out of time \u201cBetween my body and the day\u201d, \nbetween sleeping and waking, self and other, unconsciousness and consciousness \u2013 \nthe moment which becomes the existential \u201cpresentness\u201d of a new world in the second \nstanza, which also ends, via a similar syntactic spiralling, timelessly where it began, \nsuspended in the \u201choly\u201d time before the original sin, \u201cwholly in the right\u201d, and before \nthe onset of History. To say that this Edenic moment is re-created in the optative \nmood is to emphasise the knowing fictionality of this seductive literary wish-\nfulfilment. The knowingness is in the playful phrasing: \u201cthe vaunt of the dawn\u201d \nteeters on the edge of self-parody, \u201cthe nocturnal rummage \/ Of its rebellious fronde\u201d \nsounds as if the submerged political analogy (\u201cfronde\u201d refers to French \ninsurrectionaries) is being mildly ribbed, and so on. Such moments are always poised \nto slip into graver images and sounds. The effect unsettles, questioning the \nnuminousness of the experience. The wavering tones belong to a poet with an \nirremediably (and perhaps in his own eyes irredeemably) worldly and ironic \nintelligence, even, or especially, when approaching the numinous and otherworldly.  \nAs a series of \u201csecular\u201d poems \u201cHorae Canonicae\u201d gives the devilish-criminal \nin the poet ample scope, especially when it comes to the next poem, \u201cTerce\u201d, with its \nthumbnail sketches of those, including the poet, who are inevitably to participate in \nthe crucifixion, sketches drawn at times amusedly, at times laconically, the worldly \ntone turning world-weary. As in \u201cMus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts\u201d life will continue willy-nilly \n while the abominable rite occurs, and some details from that poem carry over into \nthis: in particular the hangman\u2019s comically friendly dog recalls the earlier poem\u2019s \ndogs with their \u201cdoggy life\u201d. The earlier poem\u2019s daily unconcern gets transmuted in \n\u201cTerce\u201d into the disregard of the small and large deities who \u201cCannot be bothered \nwith this moment\u201d. That casual tone has turned by the last line into the deadly irony \nof \u201cknows that by sundown \/ We shall have had a good Friday\u201d (more deadly than \nEliot\u2019s \u201cin spite of that, we call this Friday good\u201d).12 The stifling by brackets of the \nknotty and central theological paradox of free will and God\u2019s omniscience \nunderscores the intransigently secular perspective: \u201c(that is what \/ We can never \nforgive. If he knows the answers, \/ Then why are we here, why is there even dust?)\u201d. \nDoes the speaker know he is echoing the Bible (\u201cFor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt \nthou return\u201d, Genesis, 3:19)? The poet must know, but in this fictional enactment his \npersona evidently does not. What, asks the casual parenthesis, is the point of it all, the \nmeaning of life no less? \u201cSext\u201d likewise indulges a worldly-wise manner in its \nportrayal of the three components of any civilization (a section of the poem for each) \nthat make possible the crucifixion: those with a vocation, the executives, the crowd. \nBut each section, written in the poet\u2019s most characteristic and lively diagnostic mode, \nis brought up short by an absolute and unanswerable paradox. The first section asks \nwhere society would be without those who have a vocation; and yet, it abruptly ends, \nwithout them \u201cthere would be no agents\u201d for the crucifixion. It is not just that we are \nstymied by the paradox; we are perplexed by the sudden negation of the poet\u2019s \nimaginatively inventive art that has but a moment before been wittily creating and \ncategorizing a society. \nIf \u201cHorae Canonicae\u201d is not confessional in the manner of, say, Lowell\u2019s \u201cLife \nStudies\u201d, the figure of the poet is throughout intermittently but continually implicated \n and questioned in the stylistic ways this account has been suggesting. If the poet, as \nhe is imagined in \u201cTerce\u201d to have been before the crucifixion, does not know who he \nis to write about that day, he realizes it only too well in his aubade after the \ncrucifixion, in \u201cPrime\u201d. If coming to consciousness brings with it all the world of \nknowledge, endeavour, responsibility, guilt and death, it brings with it also an \nawareness that that Truth has been told and fictionalised in poetry only too famously: \n\u201cI draw breath \u2026 \/ \u2026 and the cost, \/ No matter how, is Paradise \/ Lost of course and \nmyself owing a death\u201d. Suspending Milton\u2019s epic across the line-break like this enacts \nthe opening up of the Edenic moment only to experience its immediate withdrawal as \nthe contingent world of time and guilt impinges. It also underlines the literariness of \nthis experience: it is a story told often before. At the same time, the implication of the \npoet in this sinful world casts a shadowy guilt over his literary endeavour. A curiously \ncovert link exists between sin and poetry here, created by the way in which the line \nelides Paradise Lost and the guilty poet with not so much as a comma between them. \nAnd if the \u201cbreath-death\u201d echo makes its point with too obvious an audibility, that \ncould be the point: \u201cof course\u201d the story is only too familiar, at any rate to the card-\ncarrying Christian.  \nTo the poet, that presents a particular challenge, as is evident from the \nhauntingly powerful \u201cNones\u201d. At the heart of this heartfelt poem, which is central (in \nboth senses of the word) to the sequence, is a massive absence, an emotional blank. \nWhere we are now, at this moment in History, is nowhere; and in the midst of this \nabsence we encounter the poet\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger. After evoking the post-crucifixion \nsense of existential desolation (\u201cWe are left alone with our feat\u201d, a bitterly laconic \ncircumlocution for the abominable rite) and the now meaningless world of human \naction, the poet fleetingly includes his former poetic self, for among the \u201cdiscarded\u201d \n artifacts are snatches of poetry (\u201cAbandoned branch-lines\u201d, \u201cGrindstones buried in \nnettles\u201d) that recall Auden\u2019s prelapsarian youthful poetic landscapes (which even then \nwere on the verge of lapsing), the post-industrial \u201cwatershed\u201d of \u201cdismantled \nwashing-floors, \/ Snatches of tramline\u201d. Apprehensions of the numinous and timeless \nmay be explained only \u201ctoo well\u201d now by the fact of the Incarnation and its \nculmination, and the crucifixion may have the potential to make sense of History, but \nfor the time being our guilt-ridden existence will continue inexplicably, is the \nimplication, however we \u201cmisrepresent\u201d or \u201cuse this event\u201d (including using it in \npoetry). But the poet would escape his sense of desolation in an emotionally \nexhausted aversion of eyes and mind. However, \u201cour dreaming wills\u201d only \u201cseem to \nescape\u201d, for what follows in the penultimate stanza is a series of increasingly \nnightmarish imagery which, as it proceeds, in Anthony Hecht\u2019s words, \u201ctakes on the \nsomewhat vulgar contrivances of an unconscious with the taste and standards of \ngrade-B movies.\u201d Hecht is evidently not intending to be negative, for, as he implies, \nthe encounter at the end of the stanza puts the nightmare into ironic perspective, \u201cthe \narch-villain\u201d of the movie turning out to be the poet\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger \u201cin Poe-like \nseclusion\u201d.13 In his self-absorption the poet-figure has been inventing cinematic \nscenarios that, however compelling, come across as all too knowing re-writes of early \nAuden again, with an eye for would-be diagnostic details, mysterious antagonists and \nsignificant landscapes, and an ear for the fast tone and authoritative air. If phrases like \n\u201clatent robbers\u201d and \u201chostile villages at the heads of fjords\u201d sound clich\u00e9d, they do so \npartly because early Auden, as its supreme practitioner, has accustomed us to this \nidiom of urgent sinister-comic threat (\u201clatent robbers\u201d is a good joke: they lie hidden \nand, being robbers, are potential liars). The dream comes across as out of place in this \npoem, but that is the point: the doppelg\u00e4nger poet is being shown up. \n For the dream belongs to the \u201cwill\u201d and is therefore the product of a misplaced \neffort to explain and rationalize. When the will relaxes there ensues in the final stanza \na poetic release, undesolate and distinctly lacking the tonal games of the previous \nstanza, in the spirit of these words by Auden about the world of nature, the un-\nKierkegaardian (he insists) unconscious world of universal being: \u201cevery man has a \nsecond relation to God which is neither unique nor existential: as a creature composed \nof matter, as a biological organism, every man, in common with everything else in the \nuniverse, is related by necessity to the God who created that universe and saw that it \nwas good, for the laws of nature to which, whether he likes it or not, he must conform \nare of divine origin\u201d (Canterbury Pilgrims: 42). If these words sound preachy, their \nequivalent in \u201cNones\u201d does not. The final stanza prays that our \u201cbiological organism\u201d \nmay restore \u201cthe order we try to destroy\u201d, in an ignorance different from the poem\u2019s \nearlier vexed and desolate incomprehension. In the poem\u2019s concluding vision, of \ncreaturely care and universal law, the poet can make his point about the natural order \nwhile allowing himself a chuckle of envy with a joke about hens in \u201cpecking order\u201d. \nAnd as ever he cannot resist seeing his earlier poetic self in a new light: the youthful \nline \u201cAs the hawk sees it or the helmeted airman\u201d arrogantly (or so the later Auden \nmight have supposed) paralleled human and creaturely panoptic perspectives, whereas \nhere in \u201cNones\u201d \u201cthe hawk\u201d gazes on our fallen world \u201cwithout blinking\u201d, with a \nquasi-divine unillusioned but caring indifference.  \nIn \u201cCompline\u201d, the last service before sleep, which returns the sequence to the \nstate of unconsciousness with which it began, the poet asks, \u201cCan poets (can men in \ntelevision) \/ Be saved?\u201d The parenthetical phrase puts the poet on a par with all who \nhave to do with an audience and a public, which is everyone, since, though all \nindividuals, we are all responsible (immediately after the crucifixion, in \u201cNones\u201d, \u201cwe \n have lost our public\u201d). The poet admits that he can make no sense of what happened \n\u201cbetween noon and three\u201d, the hours Jesus hung on the Cross, instead recollecting \n\u201cActions, words, that could fit any tale, \/ And I fail to see either plot \/ Or meaning\u201d. \nBut if his poetic fictions cannot fill his amnesia satisfactorily, this means that the only \nrecourse is to fall back on prayer, which the end of \u201cCompline\u201d proceeds to do. This \nprayer, like all prayer, must learn to accept the given, numbering the poet, \nhumorously, as one of the ineffectual \u201cpoor s-o-b\u2019s\u201d who desires to be spared \u201cin the \nyoungest day\u201d, which, Fuller surmises, \u201cmay be both the Last Day and the ever-\npresent Now\u201d (Fuller: 461). \u201cAll knowledge that conflicts with itself is Poetic \nFiction\u201d: even if prayer would see beyond this, having to accept that \u201cfacts are facts\u201d, \nalways the poetry knows that it can never get further than a \u201cclear expression of \nmixed feelings\u201d, can never reach \u201cthe Truth\u201d. Both the Last Day and the ever-present \nNow, the existential moment which is no sooner present than past, are beyond poetry, \nwords even. And the ineffable is precisely, in the words that begin \u201cNones\u201d, \u201cWhat \nwe know to be not possible\u201d, a way of putting it that undoes itself even as it is uttered. \n                                                 \nNOTES \n \n1  Contribution entitled \u201cW.
