Experiments have shown that switching\ncan be complex, with reversal dependent on the metastable\nmagnetization configurations in rectangular and elliptical\nPermalloy structures subject to short axis fields.12 In other\ninvestigations, electrical measurements and magnetic force\nmicroscopy \u0001MFM\u0002 have shown that a domain wall can be\npinned in a variety of different states at a notch in an elon-\ngated structure.9,10 It has also been observed that multiple\ntemperature-dependent switching fields can occur in a wire\nand pad structure with an oblique field.11 Controlling such\nmultiple modes is important for potential applications since\nreliable switching and a narrow switching-field distribution\ncan be critical requirements for device operation.\nHere we report the effect of transverse field on the mag-\nnetization reversal behavior of planar Permalloy nanowires\nwhich have a large nucleation pad at one end. The pad can\ngenerate magnetic domain walls that are injected into the\nnarrower nanowire structure during the switching process.\nL-shaped Permalloy \u0001Ni80Fe20\u0002 planar nanowires were\nfabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate with a\ngold underlayer by electron beam lithography and metalliza-\ntion using thermal evaporation followed by resist lift-off. At\none end of each nanowire, a larger rectangular nucleation\npad of Permalloy was fabricated. The other end was pointed\nto suppress domain wall nucleation13 and resultant domain\nwall motion from this end. The four L-shaped wires studied\nhad widths of 184 nm, 303 nm, 321 nm, and 537 nm, as\nmeasured by scanning electron microscopy \u0001SEM\u0002. Each\nnucleation pad was 1.5 \u0001m wide\u000215 \u0001m long. The struc-\ntures were all 8 nm thick. The L-shape geometry was devel-\noped to study domain wall behavior more generally and is\nnot strictly needed in these experiments.\nAxial magnetization reversal was detected using a\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect \u0001MOKE\u0002 magnetometer, capable\nof detecting \u201csingle-shot\u201d switching events,14 although most\nmeasurements involve averaging of many field cycles to im-\nprove the signal to noise ratio. The switching behavior of\nboth the nanowires and the associated nucleation pads were\nmeasured separately in the presence of different combina-\ntions of orthogonal magnetic fields applied within the plane\nof the magnetic structures, at room temperature. Figure 1\nshows schematically the geometry of the samples, the orien-\ntation of magnetic fields Hx and Hy, and the MOKE laser\nbeam location used in the measurements. Hx and Hy were\napplied at 27 Hz with an amplitude of 116 Oe and Hy\n0\n, re-\nspectively. MOKE measurements were sensitive to switching\nFIG. 1.

The phase of Hy \u0001the transverse field\u0002 was\nshifted by \u0003 \/2 with respect to Hx in order to generate a field\nvector \u0001of varying amplitude\u0002 at the sample that rotated\ncounterclockwise. A domain wall is formed at the junction\nbetween the pad and the wire when the pad magnetization is\nreversed \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. As Hx increases, the wall propagates\nthrough to the corner and switches the horizontal arm of the\nnanowire \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004. As the field vector sweeps into the posi-\ntive y-direction the wall is swept up through vertical section\nof the structure to complete the magnetization reversal \u0003Fig.\n1\u0001d\u0002\u0004. In the subsequent part of the cycle, the process is re-\npeated but this time the fields and the magnetization change\nhave the opposite sign. In this way the reversal is always\ninitiated from the nucleation pad and the domain wall is\nswept up the vertical section of the wire. Only for the coun-\nterclockwise rotating field do both switching events in the\nhysteresis loops represent reversal by domain walls propa-\ngating from the junction of the pad and wire. When Hy0=0 or\nif a static field were applied along the y-axis, the reversal of\nan initially continuous magnetization will leave a domain\nwall at the corner of the structure. This wall can then propa-\ngate back towards the pad when the sign of Hx is reversed.\nTherefore, with Hy\n0\n=0 Oe or a static y-axis field, only one\nside of the hysteresis loop represents reversal by domain\nwalls propagating from the junction of the pad and wire.\nSwitching using static fields was consistent with the results\nusing the counterclockwise rotating field.\nFigure 2 shows normalized axial MOKE hysteresis loops\nfor 184 nm and 534 nm wide wires as a function of trans-\nverse fields with Hy\n0\n=0 Oe, 34 Oe, 45 Oe, and 77 Oe, re-\nspectively. The loops are averaged over several hundred field\ncycles. For the 184 nm wire with Hy\n0\n=0 Oe \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004, the\nswitching behavior is different under positive and negative\nfields, with a sharp switching event at negative fields and\nmore slowly varying reversal at positive fields. This indicates\nthat the laser spot is close to the corner and the switching is\nconsistent with sharp switching from the pad at negative\nfields and back propagation of an existing wall from the\ncorner at positive fields, as has been observed previously.15\nInterestingly, when a moderate transverse field is applied\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004, the switching transition occurs in multiple steps,\nwith clear transitions around 42 Oe and 73 Oe. At higher\ntransverse fields the switching becomes asymmetric with two\nsteps at negative field and a single step at positive fields \u0003Fig.\n2\u0001c\u0002\u0004. At still higher transverse fields \u0003Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002\u0004, single-step\nmagnetization reversal returns, but switching is sharper and\nat a lower field \u000135 Oe\u0002. By comparison, Figs. 2\u0001e\u0002\u20132\u0001h\u0002\nshow similarly averaged axial hysteresis loops from a\n537 nm wide wire. In the wider wire, two-step switching\ndevelops and becomes more pronounced at higher transverse\nfields \u0003Figs. 2\u0001g\u0002 and 2\u0001h\u0002\u0004, but not at lower fields \u0003Figs. 2\u0001e\u0002\nand 2\u0001f\u0002\u0004. Intermediate wire widths show aspects of both\ntypes of behavior, with reversal behavior more similar to the\n537 nm wire for the wider wires.\nIn order to ascertain the nature of the multistep switch-\ning observed in the averaged loops, the MOKE magnetome-\nter was set up to measure switching during a single field\nsweep. Figures 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002 show two separate \u201csingle-\nshot\u201d magnetization loops obtained from the 184 nm wide\nwire with Hy\n0\n=23 Oe. The loops have a low signal-to-noise\nratio as no averaging has taken place, but single switching\nevents can still be seen in both loops. However, the switch-\ning events occur at markedly different fields of \u00b142 Oe \u0003Fig.\n3\u0001a\u0002\u0004 and \u00b178 Oe \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004, suggesting two different modes\nfor domain wall injection into the wire under nominally the\nsame field conditions. Others loops for this sample showed\nthat the injection mode could change during one field cycle;\nFIG. 2.

Phys. Lett. 88, 032505 \u00012006\u0002\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

In all 15 of the\nsingle-shot loops recorded, reversal was always observed to\ninvolve a single sharp switch. In contrast to this, the widest\nwire shows two-stage switching in single field cycle mea-\nsurements with Hy\n0\n=56 Oe \u0003Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004 and more clearly with\nHy\n0\n=86 Oe \u0003Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002\u0004.\nFor the narrowest wire \u0001184 nm wide\u0002, the switching\nmeasurements indicate that the addition of a magnetic field\ntransverse to the axis of the wire and pad leads to more than\none energetic state for the wall at the junction. These states\nor modes require different depinning fields to allow the wall\nto propagate through the junction and switch the wire.\nDifferent modes for domain wall injection from a nucle-\nation pad into a nanowire have been suggested previously.11\nThere, the modes were identified with temperature-\ndependent domain structures within the nucleation pad, al-\nthough it is interesting to note that the switching field used\nwas applied at 30\u00b0 to the pad-wire axis, so a transverse field\ncomponent was present. Other studies9,10 suggest that the\ndepinning field and positioning of a domain wall in a con-\nstriction may be affected by the structure of the domain wall.\nOn this basis, and considering that the pad can be saturated\nalong the transverse \u0001y-\u0002 axis with a field of about 50 Oe\nwhile the 184 nm wide wire is not saturated transverse to its\nlong axis with fields up to 420 Oe, it is suggested that the\napplication of a moderate transverse field leads to a situation\nwhere the domain wall formed at the pad-wire junction can\nhave different forms or modes, each with different depinning\nfields, as observed. This variation may be largely due to the\nbehavior of the pad, since the magnetization of the wire de-\nviates much less from its long axis when a transverse field is\napplied. At higher transverse fields the magnetization in the\npad is rotated more strongly and a single mode domain wall\nwith a single switching field is obtained. Alternatively, the\nmodal switching may be related to an interaction between the\ntransverse field and the magnetization within the domain\nwall. A phase diagram of the switching field for each step in\nthe averaged hysteresis loops of the 184 nm wire as a func-\ntion of the instantaneous value of the transverse field \u0001Hy\u0002 is\nshown in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002. The switching field of the wire initially\ndecreases with increasing transverse field. Then around Hy\n=10\u201320 Oe, two modes of reversal occur. The switching\nfields of these modes fall with further increases of the trans-\nverse field until the switching abruptly becomes single mode\nagain at approximately Hy =45 Oe \u0001close to the hard axis\nsaturation field of the pad\u0002.\nThe magnetization of the 537 nm wide wire is more sen-\nsitive to a transverse magnetic field than the narrowest wire,\nas its transverse saturation field is close to 150 Oe. In 38\nsingle-shot observations of the switching transitions mea-\nsured at high transverse fields, 28 involved a two-step rever-\nsal similar to that shown in Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002. The phase diagram for\nthis wire \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004 shows switching fields at which each\nstep in the averaged hysteresis loops occurs. We suggest that\nthe change to two-step switching with a large transverse field\nmay involve a field-induced transition to a vortex state12 or\nperhaps a field-induced pinning event at the wire corner due\nto the sign of Hy opposing propagation around the corner at\nthe instant of domain wall injection \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004.\nThe intermediate width wires display characteristics that\nare similar to both the widest and the narrowest wires, but\nwith a smaller separation between the switching branches,\nsupporting the interpretation that the shape anisotropy of a\nwire affects the depinning field from the pad-wire junction.\nIn conclusion, for the narrowest wire, different switching\nfields are observed under the same field conditions. These are\nattributed to different modes or states for the domain walls\nthat are formed at the pad-wire junction. In the widest wires\nthe transverse field leads to a change from simple switching\nto a vortexlike switching process. The different response may\nbe attributed to the magnetostatic energy difference between\nthe wide and narrow wires.\n1E. Saitoh, H. Miyajima, T. Yamaoka, and G.
