Introduction \nIncreasingly within the fields of science and engineering, the unique characteristics of lasers are being \nrecognised. One such characteristic is the laser\u2019s ability to be employed for the non-contact processing \nof materials which are otherwise difficult to process, such as ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and \nconcrete. Despite the considerable amount of work that has been carried out previously to investigate \nthe laser processing of OPC and concrete, most has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and \nreinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers [1-3] and the direct glazing, single and multiple layer \nfusion cladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding for the sealing\/fixing of radioactive \ncontamination onto concrete surfaces [4-7]. More recent work by Johnston et al. [8] reported on the \nsuccessful removal of the contaminated surface layer of concrete (scabbling) by means of Nd:YAG \nand CO2 laser radiation. Work by Sugimoto et al. [9] focused upon modifying the surface appearance \nand surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. The resultant physical \ncharacteristics and mechanical behaviour of the post-process cement based materials were later fully \ncharacterised by Wignarajah et al. [10]. Borodina et al. [11] have carried out investigations into the \nstructural changes within the composition of zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 \nlaser radiation, detailing microstructural changes, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. \nIn all of the previous studies conducted with CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers, spallation and excessive \ncracking and pore formation were found to be major problems undermining the performance of the \nlaser treated surface layer. In contrast, however, work conducted by Li et al. [12] and further work \ncarried out by Lawrence et al. [13-18] using a high power diode laser (HPDL), successfully \ndemonstrated the generation of a long-lasting glaze with far fewer cracks and pores.  \nThere is a burgeoning literature base that testifies to the potential of lasers for altering the surface \nproperties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. The well documented fact \nthat generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting has been reported by Zhou and \nDeHosson [19, 20] as a result of work on the laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic material. \nBahners and Bahners et al. [21, 22], have observed and comprehensively detailed the changes in \ntechnical properties of various textile fibres, including adhesion and wetting properties, with a view to \ndeveloping an alternative to the conventional methods of chemical agents addition or wet-chemical \npre-processing. In recent years the excimer laser has been employed to precisely control and later the \nsurface characteristics of a number of polymer materials. Ample research has been carried out to \nstudy the effects of excimer laser radiation on the wettability characteristics of polyethylene \nterephthalate (PET) in both film [23], fibre [24] and sheet [25] form, as well as polyparaphenylene \nterephthalamide (PPTA) [26]. Laurens et al. [27] concluded that a more polar surface resulted from \nthe excimer laser treatment of polyether-etherketon (PEEK). Extensive and detailed investigations by \nSong and Netravali [29-31] into the effects of excimer laser radiation on the interfacial characteristics \nof UHSPE fibres and epoxy resin revealed a considerable increase in the interfacial shear strength \n 4 \nresulted after laser treatment. Furthermore, Heitz et al. [23], Henari and Blau [32] and Olfert et al. \n[33] have found that excimer laser treatment of metals results in improved coating adhesion.  \nStill, the reasons for the changes in the wetting characteristics with regard to changes in the material\u2019s \nsurface topography, surface composition and surface energy have not been reported on in great deal in \nany of the previous studies. Having said that, Lawrence and Li have sufficiently demonstrated the \npracticability of employing different types of lasers to effect changes in the wettability characteristics \nof ceramics [34-38] metals [39-41] and polymers [42, 43] for improved adhesion and bonding, as well \nas comprehensively examining the changes in the wettability characteristics of the materials in terms \nof surface topography, surface composition and surface energy. Moreover, Lawrence and Li [44] have \nextended knowledge in this field by determining the predominant influential elements involved with \nthe HPDL modification the wettability characteristics of metallic materials, as well as quantifying the \ndegree of influence each element exerts.  \nThis paper aims to extend this preceding work on metallic materials by elucidating and giving a \ngreater understanding of the basic process phenomena and the predominant influential elements \ninvolved with the HPDL modification the wettability characteristics of OPC. In particular, the \nprincipal elements governing the wettability characteristics, namely morphology, microstructure and \nsurface chemistry, and the individual effects thereof on the HPDL modified wettability characteristics \nof OPC are identified. This work describes the employment of a number of techniques to isolate these \nelements, thereby allowing their singular effect on changes to the wettability characteristics of the \nOPC treated with the HPDL to be established. \n2. Theoretical background of wettability and adhesion  \n2.1. Contact angle \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread to \ncover (wet) the solid surface. The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is known as the \ncontact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle is less than 90\n0\n. If the contact angle is \ngreater than 90\n0\n then the liquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs [45]. When a drop of \nliquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus \nwhether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces \nthat exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive). The index of \nthis effect is the contact angle, \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid and \nliquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of \nvirtual work expressed by the rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n 5 \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system [46]. This is on account of the fact that the molecular \nadhesion between solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid \n[45]. \n2.2. Work of adhesion \nIn fundamental terms, the driving force for the formation of a metal\/ceramic interface is the energy \nrelinquished when the intimate contact between the metal and the ceramic is formed. This driving \nforce is usually characterised by the adhesion energy. The adhesion energy, or work of adhesion, Wad, \nis defined as the work per unit area which needs to be provided to separate reversibly a solid\/liquid \ninterface so as to create distinct solid\/vapour and liquid\/vapour interfaces. Thus \n   sllvsvadW \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212+=  (2) \nIf one takes into account Young\u2019s equation then Eq. (1) can be rearranged to form the Young-Dupre \nequation. Thus the Wad can be expressed as \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (3) \nIn this way experimental values of Wad can be determined from the \u03b3lv value of the liquid and the \nvalue of \u03b8 produced when the liquid is in contact with the solid.  \nGenerally the value of Wad in metal\/ceramic systems can be expressed as the sum of the different \ncontributions of the interfacial interactions between two phases: \n   equilnonequilad WWW \u2212+=  (4) \nwhere Wnon-equil denotes the non-equilibrium contribution to the work of adhesion when a chemical \nreaction takes place at the metal\/ceramic interface, while Wequil represents the equilibrium contribution \nwhich corresponds to non-reactive systems. This contribution can be further divided into two separate \nterms: Wchem-equil, which is the cohesive energy between the two contacting phases that results from the \nestablishment of chemical equilibrium bonds achieved by the mutual saturation of the free valences of \nthe contacting surfaces and WVDW, which signifies the van der Waals interaction or dispersion forces. \nAs such, Eq. 4 becomes \n   equilnonVDWequilchemad WWWW \u2212\u2212 ++=  (4a) \n \n 6 \n2.3. Surface energy \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, arises from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive. The majority of these \nforces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; \nsince van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, \nthe surface energy of any system can be described by [45] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (5) \nLikewise, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [45]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (6) \nwhere \nd\nadW  is the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, \np\nadW  is the polar component of the \nwork of adhesion, \nd\nsv\u03b3  is the dispersive component of the surface energy at the solid-vapour interface, \n\u03b3 lv\nd\n is the dispersive component of the surface energy at the liquid-vapour interface, \np\nsv\u03b3  is the polar \ncomponent of the surface energy at the solid-vapour interface and \np\nlv\u03b3  is the polar component of the \nsurface energy at the liquid-vapour interface. By equating Eq. (6) with Eq. (2), \u03b8 for solid\/liquid \nsystems can be related to the surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (7) \nAccording to Fowkes [45], \u03b3 sv\nd\n can be estimated by using Eq. (7) and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 \nagainst (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv. Hence the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n) of the line which \nconnects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) \ncorrelating the data point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1.  \nIt is not possible to determine \np\nsv\u03b3  in the same direct fashion as the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 \nagainst (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv and as such, only refers to individual control test liquids and \nnot the control test liquid system as a whole. Still, it has been established that the entire amount of the \nsurface energies owing to dispersion forces of either the solids or the liquids are active in the \nwettability performance [45, 47]. It is therefore possible to calculate Wad\nd\n by using only the relevant \npart of Eq. (6) thus \n 7 \n ( )dlvdsvdadW \u03b3\u03b32=  (8) \nNow, if one plots a graph of adW  against Wad\nd\n for the solid substrate, then for each particular control \ntest liquid in a given system in contact with the solid substrate surface, Wad  (which can be determined \nfrom Eq. (3)) can usually be correlated with Wad\nd\n by a linear relationship which satisfies \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (9) \nFor a solid substrate the constants a and b can be deduced respectively by calculating the gradient of \nthe best-fit straight line and by extrapolating the best-fit straight line to find the axis intercept. Also, if \none plots a graph of \np\nlv\u03b3  against \nd\nlv\u03b3 , then for the control test liquids in a given control test liquid \nsystem, \np\nlv\u03b3  can often be correlated with \nd\nlv\u03b3  by a linear relationship which satisfies \n  ( ) ( ) dc dlvplv += 2\/12\/1 \u03b3\u03b3  (10) \nAgain, for a solid substrate the constants c and d can be deduced respectively by calculating the \ngradient of the best-fit straight line and by extrapolating the best-fit straight line to find the axis \nintercept. By introducing Eq. (9) into Eq. (6) and rearranging, then \n       ( )W a W badp add= \u2212 +1  (11) \nor alternatively \n              ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp svd lvda\nb1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n1\n2\n\/ \/ \/ \/\n= \u2212 +  (12) \nFurther, by introducing Eq. (10) into Eq. (12) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, considering \nthat ( )\u03b3 svd\n1 2\/\n and ( )\u03b3 svp\n1 2\/\nare constant, then the following is valid: \n                         ( ) ( ) ( )\nc\nadsvp\nsv\n1\n2\/1\n2\/1 \u2212\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03b3  (13) \nSince \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined from the plot based on Eq. (7), it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n \nfor the solid substrate using Eq. (13). By employing this approach it is possible to determine, from \u03b8 \nmeasurements and the control test liquid surface energy properties, the changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics effected by HPDL treatment of the OPC. \n \n 8 \n3. Experimental procedures \n3.1. Materials \nThe OPC used in this work was the naturally occurring layer that forms on the outer surfaces of \nconcrete following casting. In this instance, to facilitate the simple execution of the experiments, as-\nreceived concrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 mm\n3\n) prior to HPDL treatment. \nThe composition by volume of the OPC is as follows: CaO (63.9%), SiO2 (21.9%), Al2O3 (5.7%), \nFe2O3 (2.8%), SO3 (2.7%), MgO (2.2%), K2O (0.7%) and Na2O (0.1%), whilst the concrete blocks \nthemselves had a composition by volume of: 20 mm limestone aggregate (40%); 10 mm limestone \naggregate (14%); zone M sand (28.5%); OPC (10.5%) and particulate fine aggregate (7%). \n3.2. Laser processing arrangement \nIn this work a HPDL (DL020, Rofin-Baasel) emitting at 940\u00b110 nm with a maximum output power of \n2 kW. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 10 m long, 1.5 mm core \ndiameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a focusing lens assembly. The laser \noperated in the continuous wave (CW) mode and produced a multi-mode beam. The defocused laser \nbeam was fired across the surface of the OPC samples by traversing the samples beneath the beams \nusing the x- and y-axis of CNC gantry tables at speeds ranging from 60-600 mm\/min. The laser optics \nwere protected by means of a coaxially blown shield gas jet a rate of 5 l\/min. To investigate the \neffects of process gas type Ar, N2 and O2 process gasses were employed. To determine the \ncharacteristics of the glazes the as-received and HPDL treated OPC samples were examined using \noptical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX) and \nX-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques.  \n3.3 Wetting and surface energy characterisation procedure \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the as-received and HPDL treated OPC \nand hence quantify any surface energy changes in the OPC resulting from HPDL interaction, a series \nof control experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of liquids with \nknown surface energy properties. The control test liquids, along with their total surface energy, \ndispersive and polar components, are detailed in Table 1. This particular test liquid series was selected \nbecause it has been shown in previous studies [34-38, 48] to be most suitable for materials such as \nOPC. The experiments were conducted in normal atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 20\n0\nC \n\u00b120C with the temperature of the liquids themselves throughout the experiments also being \nmaintained at around 20\n0\nC. The droplets were released onto the surface of the test OPC (HPDL \ntreated and as-received) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being \napproximately 6 x 10\n-3\n cm\n3\n. Each experiment lasted for three minutes and profile photographs of the \n 9 \nsessile drops being obtained every minute with \u03b8 being measured simultaneously. The standard \ndeviation due to experimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.80. \n4. The effects of high power diode laser interaction on the wettability characteristics of \nordinary Portland cement  \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of a solidified vitreous enamel (20\n0\nC) placed on the surface of \nthe OPC (a) before and (b) after HPDL irradiation with \u03b8 superimposed is shown in Fig. 1. The \nexperimental results showed that throughout the period of cooling of the enamel, from the molten \nstate at 600\n0\nC to the solid state at room temperature, no discernible change in the magnitude of the of \n\u03b8 took place during the time of the experiments. This observation indicates that thermodynamic \nequilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the experiment [48]. It is \nclearly apparent from Fig. 1 that prior to HPDL interaction, it was not possible to fire the enamel onto \nthe surface of the OPC since \u03b8 was measured as 1090, and as such would prevent the enamel from \nwetting the OPC. Indeed, HPDL interaction with the enamel when placed on the as-received OPC \nsurface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel, that is the formation of small spheres \napproximately the diameter of the laser beam itself [49-50]. Furthermore, as is evident from Table 2, \nunder the experimental laser parameters employed and processing in an O2 atmosphere, HPDL \nirradiation of the surface of the OPC samples resulted in changes in \u03b8. It can be seen that in general, \ninteraction of the OPC with the HPDL beam resulted in the \u03b8 between the OPC and the control liquids \nreducing. \n4.1. The effect of surface morphology \nThe role that the morphology of HPDL treated OPC surface plays in influencing wetting \ncharacteristics is of some importance. More specifically, the aspect of the surface morphology that is \nof particular importance is substrate surface roughness, since this aspect contributes to effect changes \nin \u03b8. Rough grooves on a surface can be categorised as either radial or circular grooves. In practical \nterms, any rough surface can be represented by a combination of these two cases [51], with two \nroughness parameters being defined as the Wenzel type, DR [52] and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR [53]. \nIn the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the likely case with the OPC, then the resulting radial \ncontact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the theoretical contact angle, \u03b8th, by [51] \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (14) \nAccording to Neumann [54], only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for heterogeneous \nsolid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by a \nrearrangement of Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n 10\n     \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\ncos\n (15) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the \ncontact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is only \neffective at the position of wetting triple line [52]. Nonetheless, it is evident from Eq. (15) that if the \nroughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will become small, thus, a \nreduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the liquid if \u03b8w<900. Conversely, if \u03b8w>900 \nthen the opposite will be observed. At this point it is worth remarking that other more sophisticated \napproaches may be taken to examine the effects of surface roughness on wetting [55]. For this present \nstudy, however, the use of Eq. (7) is quite sufficient. \nRegardless of the process gas used, marked reductions in the surface roughness of the OPC were \nobserved (using a Taylor-Hobson Surtronic 3+ profileometer) after interaction with the HPDL beam \n(see Table 3). Therefore, according to Eq. (3), a reduction in \u03b8 will be inherently effected. Indeed, this \npresumption appears to be valid when one considers the \u03b8 values observed for the various control \nliquids in contact with the HPDL treated OPC (see Table 2). Such results are in agreement with those \nobtained by Nicolas et al. [56] and Lawrence et al.[34-38], who observed that laser treatment of \nvarious ceramic materials yielded smoother surfaces. \n4.2. The effect of process gas type \nAccording to Ueki [57] and Li [58], process gas type will play a part in determining \u03b8, since the O2 \ncontent of a material\u2019s surface is an influential factor governing the wetting performance of the \nmaterial. Experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the effects of using Ar, N2 and O2 \nprocess gasses on \u03b8. In order to study exclusively the effects of process gas on the wettability \ncharacteristics of the OPC, the HPDL operating parameters were set such that a similar degree of \nmelting and solidification occurred and a similar surface roughness was achieved. Wetting is \ngoverned by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material, so to determine the element content of \nO2 at the surface of the OPC, it was necessary to examine the surface using X-ray photoemission \nspectroscopy (XPS).  \nThe results of the XPS analysis of the OPC in terms of the surface O2 content when processed with \nthe selected gasses is shown in Fig. 2. As is evident from Fig. 2, increases in the surface O2 content of \nthe OPC after HPDL interaction were observed only when processing was carried with an O2 \nprocessing gas; in all other instances the surface O2 content remained similar to the original value. \nMore significantly, the assertion that surface O2 content is an important factor in determining \u03b8 is \nconfirmed somewhat by Fig. 3, in which the effects of the differences in surface O2 content appear to \nhave a noticeable influence on \u03b8. Yet it is highly significant that the reductions in \u03b8 seen in Fig. 5 bear \n 11\nno direct relationship with the surface O2 content results given in Fig. 4. Indeed, Fig. 5 shows that \nreductions in \u03b8 were brought about after HPDL treatment regardless of the process gas employed, \nwith the reductions being similar in value. Nevertheless, Fig. 5 shows quite clearly that the largest \nreduction in \u03b8 occurred when O2 was used as the process gas and the surface O2 content was \nsubsequently the highest. \n4.3. The effect of surface energy and its dispersive\/polar attributes \nAs was mentioned earlier in Section 2, the dispersive component of the surface energy of the OPC can \nbe estimated by using Eq. (7) and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv. Thus, Fig. 4 shows \nthe best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv according to Eq. (7) for the as-received and HPDL treated \nOPC (Ar, N2 and O2 process gas) - experimental control liquids system. Comparing the ordinate \nintercept points of the as-received and HPDL treated OPC (Ar, N2 and O2 process gas) - liquid \nsystems, it can be seen clearly from Fig. 4 that for the as-received OPC (Ar, N2 and O2 process gas) - \nliquid systems the best-fit straight line intercepts the ordinate closer to the origin, indicating that, in \nprinciple, dispersion forces act mainly at the as-received OPC - liquid interfaces resulting in poor \nadhesion [45, 59]. Conversely, Fig. 4 shows that the best-fit straight line for the HPDL treated OPC \n(Ar, N2 and O2 process gas) - liquid systems intercepts the ordinate much higher above the origin. \nSuch a finding implies the action of polar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, \ntherefore improved wettability and adhesion is promoted [45, 59]. \nNow, earlier in Section 2 it was shown that it is not possible to determine the value of \u03b3 sv\np\n for the \nOPC directly from Fig. 4. Instead it is necessary to utilise Eq. (13). But first it is a prerequisite that \nthat values of the constants a and c are determined. So, plotting according to Eq. (10) yielded a linear \nrelationship between \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for the control test liquids used. Thus the value of c was deduced \nas 1.3. Similarly, plotting according to Eq. (11) for the as-received and HPDL treated OPC (Ar, N2 \nand O2 process gases) allowed a to be determined \nThe values determined for \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for both the as-received and HPDL treated OPC (Ar, N2 and \nO2 process gas) are given in Table 4. Evidently the HPDL treatment of the surface of the OPC, in any \ngas atmosphere, leads to an increase in the total surface energy whilst increasing \u03b3 sv\np\n, thereby \nimproving the action of wetting and adhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the OPC after \nHPDL treatment are due to the fact that partial vitrification of the surface is occasioned, a transition \nthat is known to effect a reduction in \u03b3sv and an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n [48]. It is important to note that \nbecause of the long range ionic interactions in the OPC and the composite nature of the interfaces \nbetween the OPC and the liquids, it is highly likely that the thermodynamically defined total solid \nsurface energy, as defined in Eq. (2), will be higher than the sum of the \u03b3d and \u03b3p components of the \n 12\nsurface energy. Indeed, the derivation that leads to Eq. (5) can only be done under the specific \nassumption that the ionisation potentials are all equal and that dipole-dipole random orientation \ninteractions dominate over dipole-induced dipole random interactions. Although the increase in \n(excess) surface free energy will probably be less then the increase in the total lattice energy. On the \nother hand an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, all the data \nderived from Eqs. (4) - (5) and Eqs. (8) - (12) should be considered as being semi-empirical. \nNotwithstanding this, as the studies by Gutowski et al. [60] and Agathopoulos and Nikolopoulos [48] \nfound, it is reasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Eqs. (8) - (12) that HPDL treatment of \nthe OPC surface in any gas atmosphere has effected an increase in \u03b3p . \n4.4. The effects of surface melting and microstructure \nOwing to its complexity, the chemistry of OPC and the hydration of its various constituents has not \nyet been fully resolved [61]. Nonetheless, it is known that the constituents of OPC are minerals which \nexist as multi-component solid solution chemical compounds. One of the major constituents of OPC is \nCa, but, OPC contains in relatively large proportions SiO2 (21wt%), Al2O3 (5wt%) and Fe2O3 (3wt%), \nwhich are basic glass network formers and modifiers. As such, the intense local heating brought about \nby interaction with the incident HPDL beam results in the melting of these compounds at around \n12830C, thereby causing the materials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous glaze of \nglassy material consisting of various calcium-silicate-alumina compounds [4, 15, 16]. Indeed, the \namorphous nature of the HPDL generated glaze was verified by an XRD analysis (see Fig. 5). In \naddition, it is evident from Fig. 6 that the microstructure of the HPDL generated glaze displays no \ndiscernible structure and appears to be fully amorphous. \nIt is worth remarking on the dramatic colour change occasioned in the OPC surface of the concrete \nafter HPDL interaction; changing from grey to green. Such a change can be ascribed to the resultant \nphase transitions, and also the presence in small concentrations of metal transition ions in various \noxidation states within the OPC composition, in particular, ferric ions in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ oxidation \nstate. Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions are known to give rise to green and blue colours respectively when subjected \nto intense heating [61]. However, if both phases are present within the composition, then the colour is \ndetermined by the Fe3+\/Fe2+ ion ratio, resulting in dark blue or black colours [61]. Since the surface \nproduced after HPDL treatment was green, then it is reasonable to assume that both phases were not \npresent within the OPC. \nTaken together, it is clear from Fig. 1 that the surface meting and the subsequent changes that are \noccasioned after interaction with the HPDL beam contribute to the marked effect on \u03b8. Notably, Fig. 1 \nsuggests that the melting, and consequently the vitrification of the glass forming elements (SiO2 and \nAl2O3) within the OPC, is a prerequisite for realising significant reductions in \u03b8.  \n 13\n5. Identification of the predominant wettability mechanisms active in the ordinary \nPortland cement after high power diode laser interaction  \nFrom the foregoing results and discussion it is apparent that interaction of the HPDL beam with the \nOPC resulted in the \u03b8 formed between the control liquids altering to various degrees, depending upon \nthe laser processing parameters employed, in particular, the processing gas used. These observed \nchanges in the value of \u03b8 are caused by modifications to the wettability characteristics of the OPC and \nare brought about by: modifications to the surface roughness, changes in the surface O2 content and \nchanges to the surface energy characteristics of the OPC. In the first place, beneficial modifications to \nthe surface roughness of the OPC were seen to occur regardless of the process gas used. This implies \nthat under the conditions used, the HPDL generated glaze on the surface of the OPC gave rise to \nreductions in the surface roughness, thereby directly reducing \u03b8 in accordance with Eq. (15), and in \nturn, Eq. (3). Secondly, changes in the surface O2 content of the OPC resulting from HPDL treatment \nin the various process gas atmospheres is an influential factor in the promotion of the action of \nwetting. This is because an increase in surface O2 content inherently effects a decrease in \u03b8 and vice \nversa. Lastly, the melting and resolidification of the surface of the OPC following HPDL interaction \noccasioned a phase change by generating a vitreous surface. This in turn effected an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n.  \nIt is not possible to identify from these findings which of these elements of the wettability \ncharacteristics of the OPC are active in causing the changes in the wettability characteristics of the \nOPC after HPDL surface treatment. The degree of influence each element exerts also unclear, as is the \nquestion of whether each element acts alone or in association with another. However, by employing a \nstrictly monitored multi-stage grinding procedure, it was possible to isolate the various elements and \nthus analyse and qualitatively determine the effect each one had on the wettability characteristics of \nthe OPC. In the first stage, the surfaces of the as-received and HPDL treated OPC samples (treated in \nAr, N2 and O2 atmospheres) were ground down to a surface roughness (Ra) of 3 \u00b5m, whilst still \nretaining a HPDL treated surface. In this way it was possible to isolate the effects of surface \nroughness by rendering them non-effective, and investigate the effects of the microstructural and \nphase changes (and hence surface energy) and possibly those of the O2 content (and hence process gas \neffects). In order to evaluate the influence of surface roughness an intermediate grinding stage was \nincorporated in which the samples were ground down to 1 \u00b5m whilst still retaining the HPDL induced \nmicrostructure. In the final stage the same OPC samples were ground down further (1 \u00b5m) to remove \nthe HPDL induced microstructures. In this way one is effectively removing the effects of \nmicrostructural changes (surface energy) from the previous investigation, thereby allowing the O2 \ncontent (process gas effects) to be studied.  \n 14\nAn examination of the \u03b8 characteristics of the ground OPC samples using only glycerol revealed that \na considerable difference in \u03b8 between the HPDL treated and as-received samples was still present. \nFor the HPDL treated samples, \u03b8 had increased slightly across the range of samples to around 26-290. \nIn contrast, \u03b8 for the as-received samples was seen to have reduced from 400 to 370. From an XPS \nanalysis of the O2 content of the OPC samples it was found that the O2 content of the as-received \nsample remained around the original value of 44.7at%, whilst that of the HPDL treated samples was \nfound to have reduced to a level similar to that of the as-received sample, 44.9-45.2at%. Since a \nconsiderable difference in the measured \u03b8 of the HPDL treated and as-received OPC samples was still \nin evidence, despite grinding down the samples to a surface roughness of 3 \u00b5m, is it is reasonable to \npostulate that surface roughness does not have as greater influence on the wetting characteristics of \nthe OPC as microstructure. The slight increase in \u03b8 for the HPDL treated OPC samples is believed to \nbe due to the reduction on the surface O2 content. This is noteworthy as such a supposition implies \nthat surface O2 content is more influential in determining the wetting characteristics of the OPC than \nsurface roughness. Indeed, additional grinding of the samples bore this assertion out somewhat. In this \nsubsequent stage the samples were ground down to a surface roughness of 1 \u00b5m whilst still retaining \nthe HPDL induced microstructure, thereby allowing a comparative analysis of the effects of surface \nO2 content and surface roughness to be carried out. An XPS analysis of the O2 content of the OPC \nsamples revealed that the O2 content of the as-received and HPDL treated samples remained around \nthe values obtained after the first grinding stage; for the as-received sample around the original value \nof 44.7at% and likewise for the HPDL treated samples at 45.0-45.4at%. The values of \u03b8 observed for \nthe as-received and HPDL treated OPC were again markedly different. Whereas in the previous \ngrinding stage, \u03b8 for the HPDL treated samples remained consistent at 27-290, for the as-received \nsamples \u03b8 had further reduced to 350. Following on from this observation it is possible to assert that \nthe reductions in \u03b8 due to reductions in the surface roughness are limited to a value well above that \nachieved after HPDL treatment. Moreover, this leads one to conclude that surface O2 content is indeed \nmore instrumental in deciding the wetting characteristics of the OPC than surface roughness since no \nreduction in \u03b8 for the HPDL treated OPC samples was observed after generating a much smoother \nsurface. After the same OPC samples were ground down further (1 \u00b5m) to remove the HPDL induced \nmicrostructures, an XPS analysis showed that the surface O2 content on the as-received and HPDL \ntreated samples were virtually the same value as the original as-received sample, 44.6-44.8at%. \nSimilarly, an examination of the contact angles for the as-received and HPDL treated samples \nrevealed that \u03b8  for the as-received OPC sample remained at approximately the same value as in the \nprevious grinding stage, 35\n0\n. But more significantly, \u03b8  for the HPDL treated samples had increased \nand was now consistently in the region of the as-received samples, 36-38\n0\n. Clearly the removal of the \nHPDL generated microstructure has effected an increase in \u03b8 for the HPDL treated samples, despite \n 15\nthe generation of a much smoother surface (1 \u00b5m compared to 2.9-3.8 \u00b5m). Such findings reveal \nunequivocally that microstructure is by far the most predominant mechanism governing the wetting \ncharacteristics of the OPC. So, it is therefore reasonable to assume that surface energy differences \nbrought about by microstructural changes have a more active part in deciding the wettability \ncharacteristics of the OPC than either surface roughness or surface O2 content. Furthermore, because a \n\u03b8 increase, rather than a decrease, was realised for the HPDL treated OPC samples when reductions in \nthe surface O2 were occasioned and smoother surfaces were generated simultaneously, it is reasonable \nto assume that O2 has more influence over the wettability characteristics of the OPC than surface \nroughness. \n6. Conclusions \nHigh power diode laser (HPDL) modification of the contact angle, \u03b8, and hence the wettability \ncharacteristics of OPC has been demonstrated. Such changes in the wettability characteristics of the \nOPC after HPDL treatment can be attributed to: modifications to the surface roughness which \naccordingly effected reductions in \u03b8; the increase in the surface O2 content of the OPC which \nintrinsically brings about a decrease in \u03b8, and vice versa and the semi-empirically determined increase \nin the polar component of the surface energy, \u03b3 sv\np\n, of the OPC due to the HPDL induced surface \nmelting and resolidification which consequently created a vitrified microstructure that was seen to \naugment the wetting action. Work was conducted to isolate each of these elements, thereby allowing \nthe magnitude of their influence to be qualitatively determined. The degree of influence exerted by \neach element was found to differ considerably. From the analysis, surface energy, by way of \nmicrostructural and phase changes, was found to be by far the most predominant element active. To a \nmuch lesser extent, surface O2 content, by way of process gas, was also seen to contribute to effecting \nchanges in the wettability characteristics of the OPC, whilst surface roughness was found to play a \nminor role in inducing changes in the wettability characteristics. Furthermore, based on the findings \nof this study, it is not unreasonable to assert that the results are generic and could therefore be applied \nto many ceramic materials of a similar nature in terms of wettability characteristics modification by \nmeans of HPDL radiation. \n \n 16\nReferences \n1.
