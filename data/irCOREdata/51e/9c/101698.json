Introduction \n \nChina has been one of the major international tourism destinations since early 1980s (CNTA, \n2001, He et al, 2001, Lew and Yu, 1995). The same period has also witnessed the revolutionary \ndevelopment of information communication technologies (ICTs), especially the recent \ndevelopment in Internet. However, little research has been done to explore the ICT and Internet \nadoption status in the Chinese tourism industry and the impact of ICT on the structure of the \nindustry. This paper concentrates on exploring the ICT applications and their impacts on the \ndevelopment and tourism industry structure in China. Using the existing theoretical framework \non ICT and eTourism developments in other parts of the world, Europe and American in particular, \nthis paper sets out to examine the current status of eTourism applications in China.  \n2. Literature review \n \nInformation communication technologies have been applied in tourism since the early adoption \nof Computer Reservation System (CRS) in airlines in 1950s and in the transformation to Global \nDistribution Systems (GDSs) in the 1980\u2019s. Hotel property management systems and hotel CRS \nsystems appeared shortly afterwards, bringing switch companies into the market as well in order \nto improve interconnectivity and interoperability.  However it is the development of the Internet \nthat brought the revolutionary changes to the structure of the industry, by providing tourism \nprincipals, airlines and hoteliers, an opportunity to sell directly. Because of this development \ntravel intermediaries that connected suppliers and consumers have faced a danger of being cut \noff and replaced. Travel agents felt the most pressure of such changes. The discussion of \ndisintermediation and reintermediation has lasted for more than ten years and ever since the \ne-commerce model appeared along with the Internet booming. The implications of ICTs on the \ntourism distribution system has been discussed thoroughly and extensively in many published \nstudies including Buhalis (2002, 2003), O\u2019Connor (1999, 2000), Sheldon (1997), Inkpen (1998) \nand Cooper et al (2000), Palmer & McCole (1999), Lang (2000) and Standing & Vasudavan \n(2001). \n \nThe most recent developments in eTourism applications are at the destination level. By \nemploying Internet, Intranet and Extranet, some destination management organisations (DMOs) \nhave successfully integrated this function in promoting their destination, providing tourists with \npre-trip and in-trip information; helping small and medium-sized tourist enterprises (SMTEs) to \npromote their products. Expanding internal management within DMOs into destination \nnetworking and promotion systems (Buhalis, 1993, 1998).  \n \nDot-com entrepreneurs and other companies and investors have realised that the Internet \nshould not cannibalise business models, but act as an enabler that empowers organisations to \nachieve their objectives. Technology itself cannot bring value to any tourism company. However, \nthe strategic and efficient implementation of technology within a business can reduce \noperational costs and support the delivery of better products or services to customers. If \nmanaged properly ICTs help tourism companies and destinations to gain competitive advantage \nby either maintaining their price leadership in the market or by differentiating their product and \nservices. This will eventually lead to the increase of value added to the company. It is from this \npoint of view that strategic implementation of information technology and Internet become \ncritical for all companies trying to survive in this new economy (Poon, 1993; Sheldon, 1997; \nWerthner & Klein, 1999; Alford, 2000, WTO, 2001). \n \nHitherto, most published literature on eTourism has been based on the Internet and ICTs \ndevelopments and case studies in Europe and America, with little effort being made to study the \neTourism developments in China (Martinsoms, 2002 and McGregor, 2002). However, the huge \nmarket and great potential of the demand in China makes it imperative to appreciate how the \ntechnological transformation will influence the Chinese tourism industry structure. According to \nan online survey held by one of the official information websites (www.cnnic.com), the number \nof total Internet users in China doubled every year for the last three years. Therefore, eTourism \napplications in China are worth the attention of researchers considering the potential dynamic \nchanges. \n \n3. Research Methodology \n \nThis research aims to explore the level of adoption and the future potential of eTourism \napplications in China. As the research is examining a new study area, focusing on the supply-side \nof the Chinese tourism industry, qualitative approaches were used as the main research method, \nwith the quantitative research as a complementary method. The research starts by answering \nsuch questions as what, where, how and why China\u2019s eTourism has been developed. It then \nconcentrates on some analytical points and possible future trends. Most primary data was \ncollected from interviews conducted with tourist companies of a number of key tourism sectors \nin Beijing, the capital city of China, as well as the heart of the country\u2019s tourism development.  \n \nThe primary data was collected from 45 tourist organisations including airlines, hotels, tour \noperators, visitor attractions and the Chinese tourism authority. A questionnaire survey was also \nconducted in the hotel sector exploring further supporting evidence.  \n \nGiven the unique government-oriented business structure of Chinese tourist industry, the \nresearch has been focused on interviewing the key representatives of these sectors. Quantitative \ndata has only been collected within the hotel sector with a sample size of 30 hotels randomly \nchosen from the 190 3 Star and above hotels located in Beijing.  \n4. Research Findings \nAs this is one of the very first attempts to understand the transformation of the Chinese tourism \nindustry through ICT and the Internet, it is exploratory by nature. It concentrates therefore on \nunderstanding the dynamic changes as well as the factors that motivate these changes rather \nthan measuring and assessing the changes. As the research is exploratory in nature, key issues \nare highlighted for each industry sector and it also provides an initial understanding of the \ncharacteristics of the eTourism development in China. Evidently the tourism industry in China is \nheavily regulated with a high degree of government intervention. This is particularly the case for \nthe air transportation. \n \n4.1 Air Transportation  \n \nAs the focus of the interview was to understand the current status of ICT integration with their \nbusinesses, and possible impacts of ICT adoption on the organisational structure, only those \ninterviewees who understood both the enterprises\u2019 strategy and the ICT adoption status within \nthe company were chosen in the study. The interviews in the air transportation sector were \nconducted with a number of key decision makers in Chinese eTourism. They included the \nmarketing director of Travelsky (Beijing representative of Galileo); the director of computing \ncentre of Beijing Capital International Airport; the yield manager of Air China; the PR manager of \nChina Southern Airlines; the sales manager of United Airlines (Beijing office); and the ticketing \nmanager of CITS (China International Travel Service) ticketing office.   \n \n4.1.1 Computer Reservation System and Electronic Distribution \nGDS in China: Travelsky \nIT application in the airline industry in China can be classified into four categories: airline \nmanagement, ticket reservation, airport check-in and cargo handling. As an industry strictly \ncontrolled by the central government and its air authority, Civil Aviation Administration of China \n(CAAC), all the above systems were solely developed and provided by the only supplier in China, \nTravelSky Technology Limited. This company used to be known as Civil Aviation Computer \nInformation (CACI). Systems provided by TravelSky include Inventory Control System (ICS) \nwhich became operational in 1985; Airport Passenger Processing system (APP) launched in 1988;  \nAir Cargo System (ACS) started operation in 1994; and Computer Reservation System (CRS) \nlaunched in 1996. In 1999, the website based on the company\u2019s data network, \nwww.travelsky.com, was launched. \n \nAccording to the information provided by the marketing director of the company, Ms. Jia Lin, the \nTravelSky Computer Reservation System handles almost all business of the Chinese airline \nindustry, as illustrated in Figure 1.  This includes 97% of domestic ticketing and 75% of overseas \nticketing. It provides inventory management solutions for all 25 airlines in China, both local and \nnational. The system also handles passenger transactions for all major domestic airports, and \nthe total number of supported airports will reach 100 by the end of 2002. According to the \ngovernment regulation, Travelsky\u2019s reservation system is the only GDS within China allowed to \nissue tickets with its e-Terminals that connects all ticketing agents, of which 500,000 are \ndomestic ticketing agents and 1 million are international. All major GDSs (four global ones \u2013 \nAmadeus, Sabre, Galileo and Worldspan, and three regional ones in Asia \u2013 Infini, Axess and \nTopas) are linked with Travelsky.  \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \nWith regarding Travelsky\u2019s future development strategy, there are two strategic directions: Firstly \nfurther enriching the airline CRS system into a complete GDS of all tourist products, mainly hotels. \nSecondly developing its website into a B2B (Business to Business) platform, a fully functional \nInternet booking engine (IBE). The current website can only offer real-time flight information. \nHowever, the prospect of e-ticketing or ticketless travel based on Internet is assessed as remote \nin China for the next five years. The difficulties, quoted, included the settlement problem, i.e. the \nticket-based settlement plan between airlines and between airlines and travelers; the \ngovernment (CAAC) policy that every ticketing agent has to have a office making online ticketing \nagents impossible; and airlines unwillingness to sell seats directly online. Due to lack of mutual \ntrust for any online transaction. \n \nTravelsky treats the opening up of the Chinese airline market to foreign airlines and foreign GDSs \nas the major challenge after China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO). Foreign GDSs \nrather than the Internet, will be the greatest threat to Travelsky. As indicated above, Travelsky \nbelieves that the real B2C (Business to Consumer) market based on the Internet is not yet \nmature and will not be the case for at least another five years. However, the opening up of the \nGDS market to foreign systems is totally up to a governmental decision, which may be \nimplemented in the next a year or two. Although foreign GDS will need a certain period of time \nto get used to the Chinese market, but as soon as they are localised they will be much more \ncompetitive than Travelsky in terms of information richness, connectivity, processing speed and \nsystem stability. Hence the GDS market is expected to be transformed in the future. This will \nchallenge Travelsky\u2019s domination but may provide access to technological advanced systems and \ngreater access to international markets.  \n \n4.1.2 Suppliers: Airlines \nInterviews with Beijing Capital International Airport, Air China and China Southern Airlines\u2019 \nexecutives demonstrated that respondents are satisfied with the current ICT applications \nmonopolised by CACI. Travelsky have little intention to change. On the one hand, they are not \nable to establish their own system because of both policy prohibition and restriction of cost and \ntime in building the whole system and data network by themselves. On the other hand, they \ncannot fully control their own operation, since the government handles most parts of their \noperation such as procurement, pricing, route design, and distribution. Hence they have no \nincentive to explore the benefits of ICTs or Internet applications because they may bring them \nmore trouble. \n \nThe yield manager from Air China, the country\u2019s flag carrier airline and the largest international \nairline in China, gave a detailed description of the ICT applications in airline industry from \nanother perspective. The ICT applications in Air China currently focus on distribution and \ninventory control. ICTs have little adoption within the enterprise except for an accounting system \nand an Intranet, which is mainly used for internal e-mails. In terms of the ticketing system, it \ncurrently uses Travelsky for all domestic ticketing, and foreign GDS for overseas distribution of \ninternational routes. The yield manager stated that the airline sincerely wishes to realise direct \nonline selling to cut out commission costs. However, there are quite a few problems that make \nthis wish unrealistic. First of all, the main problem as indicated already is the means in which the \ntransactions are settled. In China, the majority (over 60%, according to the yield manager) of air \npassengers are business travellers whose travelling costs are covered by their employers or \nworking units. These travellers prefer settlement with company cheques as no personal cheque \nis available in China. On the leisure market, consumers prefer cash transactions, and they \nnormally chase discount tickets offered by travel agencies. As the enterprise is directly controlled \nby the government airline authority (CAAC) Air China cannot respond to the market as a fully \nfunctional business. This is demonstrated in the following: \n\u0001 The company cannot determine its prices according to market conditions.  \n\u0001 The company cannot control its own procurement and costs. Fuel suppliers, equipment \nsuppliers, airports, CRS and other air computing system suppliers are all appointed by CAAC. \n\u0001 The company has no right to decide its own flight routes without permission of CAAC. The air \nroutes within China as well as international routes are divided among various airlines by \nCAAC. \nDue to the lack of autonomy, Air China does not have the incentive or power to develop its own \nICT and Internet strategy. Therefore it has no intention to change the current distribution status \nwith online direct selling, as they are not prepared to tackle all the above difficulties. However, \nwith the rapidly expanding Internet, users in China and eCommerce are booming, some airlines \ndid try to implement Internet solutions in their business operation, mainly in distribution. Air \nChina has jointly developed an auto-ticketing machine system in co-operation with the Bank of \nChina. The ticketing machine is a web-based CRS terminal, which is linked to the bank\u2019s ATM \ncash point. The concept is that consumers can use their cash card to buy a ticket at the cash \npoint. After the transaction is completed, the bank\u2019s ATM machine will issue a receipt for \ncustomer. The customer can then exchange the receipt for tickets at the airport before check-in. \nThe system is still under development and may be fully functional by 2004.  China Southern \nAirlines and Hainan Airlines were the only two private airlines that considered to develop their \nown web-based ticketing and reservation system. However, the project failed due to the CAAC \nintervention. \n \nTalking about the future, the yield manager of Air China expressed certainty that the Travelsky \nmonopoly in China\u2019s airline ICT market will continue for at least another 10 years. First of all, the \nChinese government will not open up this market for the next 5 to 10 years, according to her \nestimation. Secondly, even if foreign GDS are allowed to operate in China, it is not easy for \nChinese airlines, airports, and air cargo companies to switch to another incompatible system. \nThirdly, foreign GDSs are not competitive. Foreign GDSs charge US$3.5-3.8 per transaction and \nare therefore much more expensive than Travelsky (US$0.85 per transaction). Furthermore, due \nto the strict control over foreign GDS operation and their eagerness to make profit from the \nChinese market, the commission over-riding problem is serious among those GDSs. Foreign \nGDSs encourage Chinese ticket agents to make two reservations and confirm both, one with \nTravelsky, who issues the tickets and another with a foreign GDS, which is later, cancelled. In that \ncase, airlines have to pay two GDS transaction fees (one to Travelsky and one to the \nInternational GDS) for a single ticket. Foreign GDS, make money from false bookings, and refund \na certain amount of commission to agents who make the reservation through them. A a result of \nthe government intervention and the in-competitive pricing of international GDSs as well as the \npreference of Chinese travellers to bay by company cheques or cash there is little change \nanticipated in the Chinese distribution channels for airlines in China.  \n \n4.2 Traditional Intermediary: Ticketing Agents \nIn China all ticketing agents have to be authorised by CAAC with a certain amount of guarantee \ndeposit. There are about 1.5 million air-ticketing agents categorised into two distinctive groups: \nA-type agents that can handle international flight ticket reservations, and B-type agents handling \ndomestic ticketing. However, the boundary between the two has been blurred as many B-type \nagents issue international tickets from A-type agents and sell them to their customers. Some \nB-type agents develop their own agents, generally known as C-type agents. \n \nThe agent interviewed in this research is CITS Air Ticket Agent, an A-type agent. The agency is \nmanaged by the largest tour operator in China (China International Travel Service), and is the \nfirst IATA agent in China. In the year 2000, the agent adopted a web-based international flight \nticketing system with its newly launched website www.citsair.com.cn. On this website, customers \ncan view real-time flight information as well as prices (point to point only, not including \ntransferring flights) updated everyday by a person in charge of data input. The cost is the \ndiscounted air ticket price plus the agency profit. So far, it is still the only website to provide the \ncustomer with both discounted prices and real-time flight information. When the customer \nmakes a reservation on the website, after inputting certain information, the server automatically \nsends an e-mail to the agent\u2019s terminal. The agent then reads the e-mail and calls the customer \nto confirm the booking and wait for the money to be received before issuing the ticket. The \nsystem is manually maintained by the back-office staff, with flight information coming from \nTravelsky and Galileo. The price information is manually input into the database according to the \ncontracts to different airlines and various documents issued by CAAC. After two years in \noperation, the online reservation system accounts already for one third of the agent\u2019s sales \nvolume, with another one third of reservation by walk-in and call-in customers, and the rest by \nB-type agents coming to issue international tickets. \n \nIn comparing Travelsky with Galileo, the agent prefers Galileo as it provides more detailed \ninformation such as airport location, name of transferring city, transfer waiting time, flying time, \ncorrect prices etc. while Travelsky only displays how many en-route transferring stops and \nnothing else. Galileo is easier and more convenient to operate and is a much more stable system \nthan Travelsky. However, due to the restriction of issuing BSP (bank settlement plan) ticket with \nonly Travelsky\u2019s eTerminal, the agent has to use Travelsky for ticket issuing while browsing for \ninformation on Galileo. \n \nWhen discussing the impact of the Internet, the sales manager of CITS ticket office, believes that \nthere is no threat to the travel agencies in China in the near future and for at least 10 years. The \nreasons she gave included: \n1) The complexities of international ticketing with various flight and price arrangements are too \nmuch for ordinary Chinese travellers. Even agents have to take weeks to get trained; \n2) Customers tend to change their reservations frequently. That will cost airlines a lot of time \nand money to deal with these changes; and \n3) Online settlements is a major barrier for any online transactions. Due to the preference for \ncash transactions among Chinese consumers. The under-developed banking system offers \nlimited support for online purchasing, whilst credit card transactions are up to a 3% service \nfee by the local banks, making online transactions unattractive. Neither customers nor \nsuppliers would like to pay bank charges. From the agents\u2019 perspective, for each \ninternational ticket reservation, agents can receive 7-9% commission from airlines. However \ndue to severe competition, most agents hand part of their commission out to customers as \ndiscounts. Hence the profit  margin left for agents is only 1-3%, barely sufficient to cover \nbank transaction charge. Therefore although there are signs that there is a demand for \nInternet travel sales in China, growth is restricted by lack of trust between buyers and sellers, \nan underdeveloped banking system and advanced business models that do not encourage \ntravel agencies to adopt Internet commerce.  \n4.3 Hotels \nNo central hotel reservation system exists in the hospitality industry in China. However, property \nmanagement systems (PMSs) have been widely spread in hotels ranked as three-star or above. \nThe majority of domestic invested hotels use Huayi and Zhongran (China Software), HIS (Hotel \nInformation System) or PMS. Hotels built through foreign investments or operated by \nInternational hotel chains tend to use Fidelio, Landmark or other imported application software \nsystems, in order to be compatible with other properties in their chain. ICT applications in hotels \nhave concentrated on front-office functions, including reservation, reception, housekeeping, \ncashier, catering, marketing, customer relationship management, etc.  \n \nHotel managers claimed that the major benefits of using front office systems and PMS are: \nincreasing the efficiency and accuracy of internal information transmission; saving the costs of \npaper work and information-processing labour; and increasing the effectiveness of management, \nespecially in terms of cash, account, stock and yield management. Few hotels use ICT in \nmanaging their back-office functions, including procurement, security, engineering, etc. Though \nmost hotels were aware of the importance of back-office systems, few actually use such systems. \nInterviewees explained that the primary reason is concerns over costs. Training costs and \npossible position changes of certain personnel brought by the new system employment are \nadditional factors that the hotel has to considered when deciding whether to apply an \ninformation system in back office departments. Several hotel departments such as engineering \nand procurement, often benefit from under-the-table commissions by blocking information \naccess. Such benefits would disappear if all information is transparent and can be shared among \nall accessible people. This caused resistance from within the department. Hence they considered \nthat it is much cheaper to purchase a front office system only, which is enough to keep the hotel \nrunning in good order.   \n \nHotel distribution in China has been heavily relying on sales personnel mainly, as no CRS or GDS \nexist as an alternative channel. The Internet has been used by most hotels as a marketing \ninformation tool only. On-line reservations are not truly welcomed by hotels because of the lack \nof trust of consumers\u2019 credit. Without a deposit, many online reservations have been proved to \nbe invalid bookings. Most hoteliers would rather trust telephone or fax booking. Hence, they \nrequest off-line confirmation for on-line bookings. When talking about Internet application in \nhotel operations, sales pointed out that many hotels do not have their own website, and do not \ntrust online reservation at all. Several reasons were quoted: 1) since most people can book a \nhotel room by using telephone or fax paid by their company, why bother with the Internet; 2) \nonline bank settlement is a major barrier to realised online reservations; 3) hotels cannot offer \nany discount for online reservations while customers can get a discounted rate by booking via a \ntour operator, booking centre, etc.; and 4) lack of mutual trust between customers and hotels, as \ninvalid bookings happen quite often. \n \nIn order to explore further the Internet sales conditions in Chinese hospitality industry, a \ntelephone survey was held among 30 hotels rated as 3 Star or above in Beijing. Sales managers \nof these hotels were questioned using a simple questionnaire.  The data analysis results showed \nthat: Firstly, Internet sales percentage is very low in hotels, accounted for 4% of total sales in \naverage. Secondly, there is no correlation between Internet sale volumes and hotel indicators \nsuch as by the number of guestroom, occupancy rate and whether the hotel has its own website. \nThirdly, the Internet sales among different hotels range from 0 to 40% although most hotels in \nBeijing do not have any Internet sales or reservations. Only one out of the 30 hotels reported \n40% Internet sales, which come mainly from hotel reservation centre development by travel \nwebsites such as Ctrip (www.ctrip.com) and elong (www.elong.com). Finally, 3-star hotels \ngenerate higher sales percentage from the Internet. Among the 30 hotels, 86% of the 3-star \nhotels (6 out of 7) reported certain percentage of Internet sales (5-10%) while only 55% of the \n5-star hotels (6 out of 11) and 58% of the 4-star hotels (7 out of 12) reported Internet sales. \nAlthough hotels in Beijing start receiving bookings through the Internet, it is still early days for \nthem. Lack of trust between sellers and buyers. Only rack rates being available and lack of \ndeveloped business models are quoted as factors for the slow uptake of online booking on the \nInternet.  \n \n4.4 Tour Operators  \nSimilar to most part of the world, the ICT adoption level in tour operators in China lagged behind \nthe airlines and hotels. However, the situation is gradually changing, but at a very slow pace. Two \nadoption models exist, known as CITS (China International Travel Service) model and CYTS \n(China Youth Travel Service) model, both named after the tour operators who first adopted the \nmodel. \nThe CITS model can be summarised as an ICT development platform from internal to external as \nillustrated in Figure 2. According to the company\u2019s information director, CITS started using its \ntour handling itinerary transmitting network in 1985. Recently they upgraded the system to \nconnect to the head office with its local branches and contracted hotels in twenty cities within the \ncountry via the Internet. Other web-based business operations include hotel reservations, \ninternational train ticketing, international flight information, as well as outbound tour package \ninformation. The first two functions operated on the B2B (business to business) model, while the \nlater two as B2C (business to consumer) model. Other business functions, such as cruise booking, \npassport and visa application processing, accounting, etc, have been accomplished by a separate \nclient-server based intranet. In other words, all major business activities within the enterprise \nhave been handled under the assistance of its ICT networks. Though no direct selling or B2C \nfunction has been in full play, the company believes that on the basis of high ICT adoption rate \nwithin the business, the B2C function on the Internet would be easily accomplished as soon as \nthe external environment and market are ready. \n \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nIn contrast the CITS model follows the development route from external to internal, with the \nhigher priority on the Internet website development concentrating on travel information and \nbooking platform construction. However, according to CYTS information director, its website \nwww.cytsonline.com.cn has little to do with the company core business, which is inbound travel \nhandling due to the resistance of most department managers who are afraid that the total \ntransparency of the information flow will affect their personal income, which comes from \npersonal agreed commissions or some other underhand manners. Even with the website itself, \nthe information director of CYTS is not optimistic. Since it first began operation in 1998, the \nwebsite has operated at a loss so far. Though the website offers online information, reservations \nand bank settlements, the market acceptance rate is very low. The major constraint for \nconsumers booking holidays online is that people would prefer face-to-face contact when \nmaking a decision of purchasing a holiday, a comparatively expensive intangible product. \n \nOther than the three major tour operators, CITS, CYTS and CTS (China Travel Service), a large \nnumber of small and medium tour operators in China have little adoption of ICT facilities, other \nthan using computer as a typing machine. Hence ICTs will not have a major impact on tour \noperations.  \n \n4.5 Visitor Attractions \nThis is the sector that uses information technologies least in its operation. According to a \ntelephone survey among 20 attractions in Beijing, the capital city and the most famous tourist \ndestination city in China, only two attractions (Blue Zoo Beijing and World Park, according to \nBeijing Tourist Authority) use an e-ticketing system, to handle their ticket sales, turnstile entry \ncontrol, accounting, and on-site point-of-sales. All the rest of the attractions do not use any \ninformation network in their operation, except for a few, which use intranet\u2019s e-mail function to \nsend messages. Though the two attractions using the e-ticketing system found it extremely \nhelpful in cash management and acquiring market statistics, few other attractions show any \nintention to explore the possibility of using any information systems in their site management \nand operation. The reasons quoted included lack of money for ICT investment; not trusting \ntechnology; not seeing the benefit; being satisfied with current situation; and not willing to \naccept any changes at all. \n \nHowever it was surprising to find that all places of interest in Beijing have their own web pages \nproviding information on the place but without any other function. According to the information \ndirector of Blue Zoo Beijing, it is an executive order given by Beijing tourist authority that \nrequires all attractions to have their websites or homepages on the Internet by the end of year \n2001. However, most interviewed attraction personnel do not update their websites at all. Some \nattraction websites are even thought to be inaccessible by now. \n \nAccording to information director of Blue Zoo Beijing, a New-Zealand managed tunnel-style \naquarium in Beijing, the Internet application of the attraction is limited. The company tried to \nprovide online ticketing sales without success. In the year 2001, only two tickets were sold online. \nWith such a small volume of sales, the company was reluctant to invest further in the system \ndevelopment. Hence, the online reservation function has been cancelled since 2002. For future \ndevelopment, Blue Zoo Beijing will still focus on applying technologies within the site rather than \nexploring the Internet usage. The recent step to be taken is to install few touch screen \ncomputers on site to facilitate an interactive aquatic life information distribution among visitors, \nin order to stir up people\u2019s interest in aquatic life and around their awareness of ocean resource \nprotection.  Despite Beijing tourism authority requiring attractions to build and operate websites, \nattractions are still reluctant to explore eCommerce and apply eCommerce.  \n \n4.6 Tourism Authority: China National Tourist Administration \n \nThe tourist authority in China is called China National Tourist Administration (CNTA), was \nestablished in early 1980s. It plays a role of both tourist industry authority auditing the operation \nof tour operators, hotels and tour education institutions in China and destination image promoter \nvia its overseas branches.  \nAs airlines, railway and cruise were controlled by CAAC, Railway Ministry and Transportation \nMinistry respectively, CNTA also collaborates with these bodies. Local tourism boards have been \nestablished at both provincial level and municipal level, under the leadership of both CNTA and \nlocal government. As the only destination management organization (DMO) in China, CNTA has \nadopted computer network systems since 1992, primarily focusing on accounting, statistics and \nissuing tourist information CD-ROMs. \n \nIn CNTA, 90% of office staff have been using computers connected with the administration \nintranet, composed of four SQL servers, and linked with Internet via a 2m DDN. As demonstrated \nin Figure 3 the main function of the system is to deal with office paperwork. Since 1993, the \nserver has been linked with local tourism boards at provincial level and municipal level to collect \nstatistical data on a monthly base. In 1997, the official destination tourist website, \nwww.cnta.gov.cn, was developed for the purpose of marketing and promotion, providing \ndestination information on accommodation, accessibility, attraction, catering, shopping and \nentertainment. \n \nFIGURE 3 HERE \n \nAlong with the quick development of domestic tourism, especially during the three golden weeks \non public holidays of May Day, National Day and Spring Festival, the National Holiday Tourist \nForecasting System started its operation on September 21, 2000. With such a system, tourist \narrivals on all major tourist cities and visitor attractions and accommodation supply will be \nforecasted daily and publicised on the CNTA website as well as on other mass media, during the \nthree golden weeks. People intended to travel can adjust their destination choice according to \nthe forecasting results in order to avoid being caught in overcrowded attractions or cities. \n \nIn March 2001, CNTA conducted a survey of ICT adoption rate among 49 provincial and \nmunicipal tourism boards in China. According to the survey, the average IT adoption level is very \nlow, both in terms of computer facilitation, trained personnel and communication infrastructure \nused. Only one third of all tourism boards are fully equipped with internal information \nmanagement system that can be readily connected with the national information networking \nsystem, known as Golden Travel Project, the latest move on ICT of CNTA. \n \nThe Golden Travel Project was planned by CNTA in the year 2000, and developed and controlled \nby its Information Center. The target of the project is to create a tourist management and \ne-commerce network system covering the whole country by 2005. The project is composed of \ntwo parts: industry management network, a web-based system connecting the CNTA with local \ntourism boards at different level, other governmental departments, and tourism enterprises, or \neven tourists; and a tourist e-commerce website www.yahtour.com.cn aiming to creating a \nweb-based e-marketplace for tourist product transactions via B2B and B2C models. \n \nAccording to the Director of CNTA Information Center, whose opinion represents the views of \ngovernment in e-tourism application in China, e-tourism application in China can be divided into \ntwo parts: ICT adoption and Internet involvement. In terms of ICT adoption, he pointed out that \nChina had lagged behind Europe and America for about 10 to 15 years. He attributed such \nsituation to five major issues:  \n\u0001 Lack of synergy among various sectors within the industry, i.e. without a networking system \ninvolving all players of the industry, the advantage of IT can hardly be fully recognized;  \n\u0001 Lack of infrastructure required such as communication bandwidth, technicians, inf0ormation \nand processing standards, etc.;  \n\u0001 Lack of information service providers and intermediaries to assist tourist enterprises;  \n\u0001 Fear of business\/management process reengineering caused by technological innovation \nsuch as unwillingness to learn new knowledge, losing control of information or power, \naltering the habit of a life time formed by traditional business environment, adjusting new \nenvironment;  \n\u0001 The information security problem, which is in a sense of cultural concern rather than \ntechnological. \n \nThe e-government management can only be built on the basis that all or most enterprises within \nthe industry have been fully converted into e-businesses. However, this is far from the truth of \nChinese tourism industry. In the current situation, the government should shoulder the \nresponsibility and take the lead in the industry e-transformation. On one hand, the government \ncan invest in information infrastructure development. On the other hand, the government can \npush enterprises\u2019 e-business transformation by either executive orders or other compulsory \nmeans, especially when currently many companies do not realise the importance and necessity \nof such transformation. For example, as CNTA requested that all yearly inspection documents of \ntourist companies have to be reported online, many companies have to build up a compatible \nsystem to connect with CNTA\u2019s network for such purpose. \n \nThe Internet involvement of the Chinese tourism industry has proved to be a failure and there \nare several reasons for this. Comparing with the counter-parties in America and Europe, many \nChinese tourism companies had little idea of what e-business really is when they rushed to jump \non the bandwagon, failure to reap real benefit from the Internet involvement as tourist \ncompanies in America and Europe did. The fact that many tourist companies invested a lot \nmoney in website development and end up with no business returns discouraged them to give \nfurther input to explore the opportunities brought by the Internet. The e-business development \nupsurge came too early to the Chinese tourist industry, and neither consumers nor suppliers \nwere ready for it. Perhaps the government should play a role of promoter and organizer in this \narea by providing certain guidance and assistance for enterprises. \n \n5. Discussion and Conclusion \nThe Chinese tourism industry has followed a similar pattern in the development of ICT \napplications as Europe and America. The development was first started in airlines, and then \nextended to hotels, tour operators, attractions and DMOs, with the first two sectors taking the \nlead. It is true that airlines and hotels are comparatively mature and in the last few years they \ndeveloped in terms of their ICT adoption within the organisation and the awareness of ICT.  \nThough some changes have taken places in tour operators, visitor attractions and DMOs, ICT \napplications in these sectors are limited. The research findings in this study explore a general \npicture of Chinese eTourism development status. \n \nOther than the developing unbalance among different sectors of tourism industry that is similar \nto developed countries, a few factors make IT adoption and Internet application development in \nChina a very unique and special case, and a highly complicated one to understand. The following \nfactors and issues can be clarified as important in shaping the country\u2019s e-tourism development \nframework. \n \nFirst, China\u2019s tourism development is very much inbound oriented. Companies involved in \nhandling international tourists, including inbound tour operators, 4 and 5 star hotels that cater \nfor foreign tourists, and airlines, are well established, and comparatively matured. Inbound \ntourism is also heavily controlled by established intermediaries. However, the demand for \neTourism or the driving force of ICT and Internet adoption in tourism lies in domestic and \noutbound tourist market. The mismatch between supply-demand market can partly explain the \nstagnation of eTourism developments in China.  \n \nSecondly, the structure of Chinese tourism industry is different from that of the developed \ncountries, as it is mainly inbound oriented.  The whole industry in China is simply the supply \nsection of the whole tourism system as demonstrated in Figure 4. The consumers and \nintermediaries are all from source countries that are out of the scope of this research.  The \nexamining China\u2019s tourism industry structure, demonstrates that another problem emerges and \nconsumers and intermediaries from the West expect to interact fully with Chinese tourism \ncompanies and government. Only suppliers \u2013 airlines, hotels, inbound tour operators and \nattractions have adopted ICT and Internet, while intermediaries are lagged far behind. Only \nwhen looking at domestic and outbound tour market, a few newly set-up ticketing agents and \nhotel booking centres can be found. \n \nFIGURE 4 HERE \n \nThirdly, the market is not fully operational as it functions under strong government intervention \nand policy guidance. Most tourist companies in the market are not qualified enterprises that can \nrespond to market signals in pursuit of profit maximisation. Some or most parts of the business \nfunctions are controlled directly or indirectly by government agents, rather than by companies \nthemselves. Individual companies therefore have no power and motive to search for ways to \ngain a competitive edge by reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency. \n \nIn the evolution history of IS (Information System) \/ IT (Information Technology), four stages \nare generally referred to in describing its growing importance in business world: data processing; \nIS management; strategic IS; and networked IS. In China\u2019s tourism industry, the research results \nshowed that most tourist companies still simply use ICT as a data processing tool to handle \nsimple document processing as the situation in most tour operators, visitor attractions as well as \nlocal tourism boards (DMOs). Some have developed the internal usage of ICT as a management \ntool in controlling most of primary business activities defined in the value chain model (Porter & \nMillar, 1985), such as in most star-rated hotels and airlines. However, none of interviewed or \nquestioned companies had ever strategically integrated ICT application with all activities in the \nvalue chain. Even less has been done in networked ICT facilitation among value chains with the \nindustry value system. Judging from the rough time division based on the four-stage IS\/IT \nevolution model, as illustrated in Figure 5. The e-business development in Chinese tourism today \nis equivalent to developed countries in 1970s, 30 years ago, if not earlier. \n \nFIGURE 5 HERE \n \nImpact of the Internet and Relating Issues \nDespite some ICT development, the Internet did not bring Chinese enterprises as much benefit \nas they expected. The majority of tourist enterprises in China still do business in traditional way \nwith little application of an information network. Furthermore, even the e-businesses and \nInternet-based network companies are looking for ways to combine online e-commerce with \noffline operations. Few issues can be concluded from this research to be the most important \nbarriers to eTourism in China.  \n\u0001 The settlement problem: lack of trust toward both consumer and supplier, and network \nsecurity issues are still major worries and barriers for tourist companies to explore online \nopportunities. \n\u0001 The business operation tradition and consumption culture keep people away from embracing \nthe new technology and Internet. It may change along with time, but this will be very slow. \nFrom the aspect of tourist companies, the low development level of ICT adoption in their \nbusiness activities of corporate value chain and external industry value system make it \nharder for them to jump from traditional business to an e-business, by-passing all the \ndevelopment stages in between. \n\u0001 The Internet is also creating intermediaries in Chinese tourism rather than cutting out the \nmiddlemen. With the Internet and e-business booming in the last few years, travel network \ncompanies explored the market opportunities and quickly filled in the gap. Up to now, the \ntwo most successful travel websites, Ctrip and elong, the only two travel webs in China that \nclaim to have made a profit in 2001, have benefited from positioning themselves into \naccommodation booking e-mediaries. Ctrip however claimed that over 80 percent of its profit \ncame from the hotel reservation center, an offline-booking center handling online reservation. \nThe company declared its plan in 2002 is to open a hotel reservation call center to increase \nits booking volume. \n \nFuture Trends \n \nThe future development of e-tourism in China will depend on how well the above problems and \nissues be tackled, and how long the process will take. It will definitely take China a very long time \nto have its eTourism and Internet adoption level developed to the current stage in Europe or \nAmerica. How long will it be decided by several involved stakeholders: companies, consumers, \ngovernment and even the social culture. The transformation of way of doing business and \nconsumption habits and attitudes will take a rather long period of time. Furthermore, given the \nunique government intervention economic development pattern, the role of tourism and other \nrelated government authorities play will also determine the direction and speed of China\u2019s \ne-tourism development. Still, taking the huge potential market of China, it is reasonable to be \noptimistic for its e-tourism developing future. Though the e-boom from 1998 to 2000 did not \nbring revolutionary changes to the structure of China\u2019s tourist business and industry, it did shake \nthe industry and attracted more attention to the impact of IT and Internet. The situation has \nchanged already and at a growing speed. The growing IT awareness and market demand will \nlead China\u2019s tourism into an IT intensive era, and ultimately the e-Business era. \n\nReferences \nAlford, P.
