Will the\nimpact of online learning change this? Some researchers claim that women are\ndisadvantaged in online courses. Others argue that we need a 'women-friendly cyber-\nclassroom'. Yet our experience is that the women achieve better results than the men; it is\nloner males that are disadvantaged by distance learning. We argue that online courses\nneed to be people-friendly so that no learners are disadvantaged.\nInternet and Web Design is a popular first-year introductory course in the Bachelor of\nComputing Systems degree. Since 1999 it has been taught flexibly. As well as traditional\nclassroom sessions, we offered our students the choice of working remotely. Students could\naccess the self-assessment questions and course notes and exercises in the classroom\nsessions or off site at any time of day or night. The option of online learning proved to be\nvery popular with the students, particularly those with work and family commitments.\nOur research uses pre- and post-course questionnaires and focus groups, and includes the\nassessment results and behaviour of the different demographic groups of students. We\nconsidered such issues as student motivation, preferred study methods, personal\ncommitments, access to technology and support methods.\nWe found that our course favours women and older students, who seem to be more\nmotivated, better at communicating online and at scheduling their learning. In contrast,\nmale students and younger participants need the discipline that classroom sessions\nprovide. Interestingly, our course has a larger proportion of female students than the\ndegree programme as a whole. The challenge now perhaps is to encourage loner male\n'nerds'1 to succeed online.\nIntroduction\nThe image of a stereotypical computing student is still 'geeky' (Selby, Ryba and Young,\n1997; Margolis, Fisher and Miller, 1999) or 'nerdy, unwashed and working incredibly long\n3\nMae McSporran and Stuart Young Does gender matter in online learning?\nhours, pausing occasionally to drink coke and order a pizza' (Brook, Mann and Virtue,\n2000). This might be the reason that only 20 per cent of undergraduate IT students are\nfemale (Brook et ah, 2000). Indeed over the years there have been many attempts to be\nproactive and promote women in IT, both by institutes and individuals.2\nMany researchers have reported that women are disadvantaged in the computing\nclassroom. Dale Spender (1995: 176) quotes Cole et al. (1994) as saying males 'dominate\nthe class rooms and male priorities have shaped the subject's image'. Spender feels that the\ncomputer classroom is so threatening and abusive to women that she compares it to the\nplaying field, whilst admitting like Griffiths (1985) that the research on girls focuses on\n'issues of tension and exclusion' and presents a deficit model (Spender, 1995:233).\nIn the first half of the 1990s researchers also reported that this 'locker room' atmosphere\nextended to online discussions (Kramarae and Taylor, 1993). Males behaved aggressively\nand hogged conversational space (Currie, 1993; Spender, 1995: 194). Tales of 'online\nviolence and harassment', and even stalking predominated (Bell and de La Rue, 1995).\nIndeed even in female-orientated newsgroups, almost 70 per cent of respondents were male\n(We, 1993). Kramarae and Taylor (1993) comment: 'So many men are querying, correcting\nand attacking the terms and priorities of these women-organised bulletin boards that many\nwomen have complained that the climate is too hostile for them and they have withdrawn\nas subscribers.' However, this may be because in the early 1990s the Internet population\nwas predominately male, and the software tools needed to access the Internet usually\nrequired the use of arcane text-only commands.\nSome researchers claim that this situation continues. Blum (1999) describes males\ndominating an online educational discussion forum, abusing women with .negative\ncomments about their computing and technical knowledge, causing the women to stop\nusing the discussion forum and leave the cyber-classroom. Others argue that we need\n'women friendly cyber-classrooms' (Richardson and French, 1999). However the situation\nis changing rapidly. eMarketer report a Media Matrix study that in January 1999, for the\nfirst time, women made up half of all US adult Internet users. With more women online,\nresulting in more women using online learning, male voices should no longer dominate.\nThere is also disagreement whether the Net is suitable to the learning styles of female\nstudents. Anderson (1997) suggests that female learners have a marked preference for face-\nto-face communication. Belanger (1999) emphasizes that whilst there is still a lower rate of\nfemale participation on the Internet, the Net may prove more suitable to the learning style\nof females. Even more interestingly, a Canadian study of the use of computer\ncommunications for learning reported that 81 per cent of the women reported a positive\nexperience compared with 77 per cent of the men.3\nAt this time many tertiary institutions are experimenting with online learning (Bates,\n1995). Many of the courses offered use 'course building shells' which allow content experts\nto design a course with minimum technical knowledge (e.g. WebCT, Blackboard\nCourselnfo). Blackboard administrator John Simmons reported that the system has\n300,000 registered students and according to their Website, WebCT has 6.9 million\nstudents in 1,494 institutions in 57 countries. Both companies are also experimenting with\n'brokering' and promoting well-designed pre-packaged courses to be taught online. With\nthe trend towards 'life-long learning' there is an increase in self-study online as well as\n4\nALT-] Volume 9 Number 2\ninstitutional credited courses. Belanger (1999) reports that in 1998 21.6 per cent of Internet\nusers used the Internet for distance education.\nMany papers have been written about the problems faculty members face in this new\nlearning environment. If technological and teaching style changes prove challenging for\nthe teachers, what about the students? Should we be concerned whom this computer-\nsupported learning community best suits? Who learns best online and which group adapts\nbest to this method and media? Students pay course fees but may not have the skill set to\nlearn online'. Should we be warning them that they might not have the attitude or aptitude\nrequired, or just take their money? According to Bates (1999: 11) course providers should\n'identify key target groups and markets for online, multimedia education and training;\ndevelop programming for which there is a well defined market, both in the private and\npublic sectors'. Should we also profile which students engage cognitively with online\nlearning and which do not? Is online delivery best used for discussion and communication-\nrich courses rather than practical subjects?\nWhile the move to online learning is mainly a response to the changing needs of students,\ninstitutions also expect that teaching online will save time, cut costs and earn revenue.\nLearning off site within a virtual 'learning community' is touted as convenient, cheaper\nand useful (Richie, 1997; Trinkle, 1999). Leaving aside the question of whether this is true\nor not, the trend to online learning may have the side effect of benefiting learners who feel\nintimidated in the classroom. Our experience is that the women achieve better results than\nmen do; it is the loner males who are disadvantaged by distance learning (e.g. Young,\nDcwstow and McSporran, 1999). We will argue that online courses need to be people-\nfriendly so that no learners are disadvantaged.\nAbout the course\nInternet and Web Design (IWD) is a popular first-year introductory course in the Bachelor\nof Computing Systems degree. Students with a wide range of ages, ethnic backgrounds, life\nand work experiences study it. At first it was taught by traditional means of lectures and\npractical classroom sessions. Then in the first semester of 1999 we changed to a more\nflexible method of teaching (Young et ai, 1999). As well as classroom sessions, we offered\nour students the choice of working remotely - that is, working through the lecture notes,\npractical exercises and weekly formative self-assessment questions online. Students could\naccess the Website in the practical sessions or off site at any time of day or night. If they\nhad a problem they could attend a classroom session or use electronic communication to\nseek specific help. The option of this flexible learning format proved to be very popular\nwith the students.\nIn the 1999-2000 summer school, the course was offered completely remotely (Dewstow,\nYoung and McSporran, 2000). There were no face-to-face (F2F) sessions except an\nintroductory session, the project presentations and final exam. If students had problems,\nthey had to seek help electronically. They were requested to post their question on the\nbulletin board rather than use email. This avoided duplication of lecturer responses;\nattempted to mirror classroom communication by allowing students to answer each other's\nquestions; provided students with experience of Web-based discussions; and tested the\nsuitability of bulletin boards for online courses. .\n5\nMae McSpormn and Stuart Young Does gender matter in online learning?\nThe IWD course is assessed by means of a group research report, an individual practical\nexercise (production of a ten-page Website) and a written exam. Part of the group research\nreport mark is attributed to electronic communication. There have been no changes to the\nmethod of assessment across the semesters so we are able to compare results from students\nwho studied in class with those who studied completely online and those who studied\nonline but had the option of F2F contact.\nStudy methodology\nData for the study were collected in three ways.\n1. Pre- and post-course surveys: This study is part of an ongoing program of research\nusing pre- and post-course questionnaires, which seek both qualitative and quantitative\nanswers. On the first day of the course the students are asked to fill out a questionnaire,\nfrom which we gather information on their ethnic background, age, gender, previous\neducation and Internet experience, and asked them to choose whether they would study\nonline or in traditional classroom sessions. At the end of the course the students\ncomplete another survey which determined their actual method of course\nparticipation, and also gathered their comments about the experience of online\nlearning. Students scored items on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 'strongly\ndisagree' to 5 'strongly agree'. For continuity, the summer school questionnaires used\nthe same questions as previous semesters, but additional questions relevant to the\n' unique situation of the summer school were added.\n2. Student assessment results: There were student results from both formative and\nsummative assessments completed during the course. The results from the different\ngroups were compared.\n3. Focus groups: In 1999 students who studied entirely online were invited to a post-course\nfocus group, where their thoughts and experiences of online learning were discovered.\nIn Semester 1, 1999, this was conducted by Dr Cathy Gunn of Auckland University,\nwhile in Semester 2, 1999, it was conducted by Claire Donald of UNITEC.\nThere is a difference between the total number of pre- and post-questionnaire responses.for\neach semester. Reasons for this include student drop-outs, non-attendance at the project\npresentation sessions when the post-questionnaire is filled out and students not filling in\ntheir names on the questionnaire. In Semester 1, 1999, there were 71 first questionnaires\nand 54 matched second questionnaires. In Semester 2, 1999, there were 90 first\nquestionnaires and 63 matched second questionnaires. In the summer school, 1999-2000,\nthere were 27 first questionnaires and 19 matched second questionnaires. In Semester 1,\n2000, there were 88 first questionnaires and 68 matched second questionnaires.\nResults\nGender of students studying IWD\nMore women study IWD than other computing courses in the degree as shown in Table 1.\nThis discrepancy could result from students from other degree programmes studying our\ncourse, people working on full-time study of IWD as a Certificate of Proficiency (COP), or\n6\nAIT-J Volume 9 Number 2\njust that it is more popular with women within the degree than, for example, programming\nor network courses.\nSemester\nSemester 1,1999\nSemester 2,1999\nSummer School, 1999-2000\nSemester 1,2000\nBCS Degree average 1999\nno.\n21\n32\n7\n23\nFemale\n(%)\n29.6\n36.0\n28.0\n26.1\n23.0\nno.\n50\n57\n18\n65\nMale\n{%)\n70.4\n64.0\n72.0\n73.9\n77.0\nTable I: Gender ofstudents studying IWD 1999-2000\nThe popularity of IWD among women is presumably due to the nature of the course: it\ninvolves a great deal of interpersonal and visual communication and it is currently a very\npopular and highly hyped subject. Anecdotal and focus group evidence points to the\nfemale students thinking ahead to the workplace. They see Web-page design as an\nopportunity for home-based or part-time employment. Margolis et al. (1999) describe this\nconcept as 'computing for a purpose'. The possibility of contract and part-time work and\nworking from home is highly featured in an Australian Information Industry Association\nreport ('Women in Information Technology'). Also promoted is 'job sharing' and meshing\nfamily responsibilities with work.\nGender differences in the choice of working remotely or in class\nThere was a consistent difference between the sexes as shown in Table 2. Between 52 and 62\nper cent of the women taking IWD chose to work in class compared with 63-80 per cent of\nthe men. The men were also more uncertain - the men were more likely to say maybe,\nwhereas the women were more definite that they wanted to work online.\nSemester\nSemester 1, 1999\nSemester 2,1999\nSummer School, 1999-2000\nSemester 1,2000\nClass\n57.1\n62.5\n\u2014\n52.2\nFemale (%)\nRemote\n38.1\n31.3\n100.0\n39.1\nMaybe\n4.8\n6.3\n-\n8.7\nClass\n80.0\n63.2\n-\n64.6\nMale (%)\nRemote\n10.0\n26.3\n100.0\n27.7\nMaybe\n10.0\n10.5\n-\n7.7\nTable 2: Gender differences in the choice of working remotely or in class\nAs stated above, the higher popularity of studying remotely among women could be due to\na number of factors. The women may have family and work commitments making\ntravelling to campus more costly in time as well as financially. Typical of the favourable\nstudent comments was: 'It's available anywhere even from home. It's very handy to study at\nyour own speed.'\nGender differences in the assessment results\nThere are large differences in the mean assessment results between the genders as shown in\nTable 3.\n7\nMae McSporran and Stuart Young Does gender matter in online learning?\nAn interesting result, but perhaps outside the scope of this paper to explain, is that on\naverage the women did better than the men. Women consistently scored better than men in\nboth assignments, while in the final exam the scores were more equal.\nWe expected that the women would score more highly on the group 'research project' which\ninvolves communication, report-writing and teamwork. We expected that the 'Webpage\nproject', which is more technical, would favour the males. This turned out not to be the\ncase, and in fact the females scored consistently better for both assignments, except in the\nsummer school.\nAll Semester\nSemester 1,1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School\nSemester 1,2000\nFemale Semester\nSemester 1, 1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School\nSemester 1,2000\nMale Semester\nSemester 1,1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School\nSemester 1,2000\nNo.\nStudents\n71\n83\n25\n88\nNo.\nStudents\n21\n31\n7\n22\nNo.\nStudents\n50\n52\n18\n66\nAssl\nMean\n62.4\n58.1\n59.1\n53.9\nAssl\nMean\n70.4\n60.7\n64.1\n64.0\nAssl\nMean\n59.1\n56.4\n57.2\n50.4\nNS\n0\n2\n0\n1\nNS\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNS\n0\n2\n0\n. 1\nAss2\nMean\n60.3\n59.7\n59.1\n58.6\nAss2\nMean\n65.5\n63.7\n57.6\n60.0\nAss2\nMean\n58.1\n57.0\n59.7\n58.2\nNS\n0\n5\n1\n0\nNS\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNS\n0\n5\n1\n0\nFinal\nMean\n65.9\n63.8\n61.1\n61.7\nFina\nMean\n68.4\n63.8\n49.1\n60.7\nFinal\nMean\n64.8\n63.8\n67.2\n62.0\n1\nNS\n4\n8\n4\n13\n1\nNS\n0\n2\n0\n4\nNS\n4\n6\n4\n9\nTotal\nMean Pass Rate\n61.5\n56.8\n54.7\n55.1\nTotal\n87.3\n83.1\n76.0\n73.9\nMean Pass Rate\n67.6\n61.5\n' 55.1\n56.7\nTotal\n95.2\n87.1\n85.7\n72.7\nMean Pass Rate\n58.9\n54.0\n54.6\n54.6\n84.0\n80.8\n72.2\n74.2\nNS = Non-submission, Ass I = Assignment I (group research report), Ass2 = Assignment 2 (Website project), Rnal =\nFinal Exam\nTable 3: Mean assessment results 1999-2000 by gender\nThis may be because the men are more likely to be over-confident, leave assignments to the\nlast minute, and therefore score less well. Some supporting evidence for this comes from the\nnon-submission results. The women always submitted every assignment, whereas the men\nwere much more likely not to submit assignments. Further evidence comes from the self-\nassessment results. In Semester 1,1999, of the twelve students who never recorded any quiz\nattempts, eleven were male and only one was female. Perhaps the women follow our\ninstructions, while the men felt the quizzes were unnecessary for them.\nRemote\/class differences in the assessment results\nFor both genders, who completed the course, the online learners did better than their\nclassroom counterparts, although the differences are not significant. However, we do not\nattribute this to students learning better online. Instead it is more likely that the better\nstudents, with greater prior knowledge of the subject, or a better developed work ethic,\ntend to choose to work online.\n8\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nBel anger (1999) reports a study at York University, where students taking online courses\nachieved significantly higher grades. However there are just as many studies that report\nclassroom students performing better. According to Kerlin, Hitz predicted in 1990 that\n'there will be no significant difference in scores measuring mastery of material taught in\nthe virtual and traditional classrooms'. And with the exception of 'computer science\ncourses', in which the virtual class (VC) grades were significantly better, his research\nshowed no significant differences. In an online computer science course at the University of\nUlster, Anderson (1997) noted some improvement and certainly no deterioration in\nacademic grades achieved compared with previous groups who studied in class.\nGender differences in student access to the learning materials on the course\nWebsite\nThe logfiles from WebCT show that on average women attempt more of the weekly self-\nassessment quizzes, view more pages of the course Website and read and post more bulletin\nboard messages as shown in Tables 4 and 5. The females' page views are consistently higher\nacross the semesters than the males by a factor of 1.5. The average number of bulletin\nboard messages read by females is also more than the males by a factor of 1.7 in summer\nschool, 1999-2000, and a factor of 2.3 in Semester 1,2000.\nSemester\nSemester 1, 1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School, 1999-2000\nSemester 1,2000\nFemale\nHits\n217.9\n498.9\n416.9\nRead\n_\n0.0\n120.3\n38.5\nPosted\n_\n0.0\n5.0\n4.3\nMale\nHits\n_\n144.6\n342.8\n249.2\nRead\n_\n0.0\n68.7\n16.2\nPosted\n_\n0.0\n3.9\n2.6\nTable 4: Average total semester WebCT page views and bulletin board access by gender\nWe tell the students that they must attempt the self-assessment quizzes every week, but many\nof them never attempt any of the quizzes. There is a wide spread of numbers of attempts\nranging from none to all possible quizzes (the actual total number of possible quizzes is\ngradually increasing as we improve the course Website). The average number of unique\nattempts shows a consistent difference between the genders. The females, on average, attempt\nmore quizzes than the males. The males are much more likely never to attempt any quizzes.\nSemester\nSemester 1, 1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School, 1999-2000\nSemester 1,2000\nTotal\nQuizzes\n16\n18\n18\n20\nAverage\n_\n11.8\n12.7\n11.4\nFemale\nNever\n1\n5\n1\n4\nAverage\n8.7\n11.6\n7.4\nMale\nNever\nII\n10\n1\n20\nNever = did not record any quiz attempts over the entire semester\nAverage = Average total number of unique quiz attempts over the entire semester\nTable 5: Average total weekly self-assessment question attempts by gender\n9\nMae McSporran and StuartYoung Does gender matter in online learning?\nIt seems as though the men are missing out on 'practice and drill' and this is reflected in\ntheir assessment results (see Table 3). Do the men think they know better and tend to\nignore our instructions and go off and do their own thing, whereas women work\nmethodically through our instructions and do everything asked of them?\nEnd of course questionnaire\nIn the end of course questionnaire, one of the questions is: 'How useful was online\nlearning for you?' It is hard to make any statistically viable conclusion from the results\nbeyond the fact that on average the students rated their experiences of online learning very\nhighly. However, there are two points to make. In Semester 1, 1999, the male students who\nstudied remotely gave a much lower score than either their remote female counterparts or\nthe males who studied in class, suggesting that they had a less positive experience. However,\nthis trend did not continue in the following semesters. One reason for this may be that in\nSemester 1,1999, the males had no experience of what online learning was about, whereas\nin later semesters they could draw on the experiences of the network of previous students.\nFurthermore, based on the results of the previous semester from Semester 2, 1999\nonwards, we have explicitly warned the over-confident young males of the pitfalls of online\nlearning, and sent out regular emails to remind them. Perhaps this group decided to study\nin class, or maybe they just have a more realistic attitude towards online learning.\nSemester\nSemester 1,1999\nSemester 2, 1999\nSummer School, 1999-2000\nSemester 1,2000\nFemale Average\nClass\n4.4\n3.9\n\u2014\n4.6\nRemote\n4.6\n4.4\n3.8\n4.3\nRating\nMaybe\n5.0\n5.0\n\u2014\n4.0\nMale Average Rating\nClass\n4.2\n4.2\n-\n4.0\nRemote\n3.4\n4.3\n3.9\n4.6\nMaybe\n4.8\n5.0\n-\n5.0\nTable 6: How useful was online learning for you?\nDiscussion\nMany authors note that limited computer resources can widen the gender gap in the\nclassroom, as men literally push women off the computers (Spender, 1995: 187). In our\npractical sessions there is one computer for every student so this is a non-issue. However,\nwe do notice that women tend to sit together in the practical sessions, so perhaps women\nare choosing to work remotely because they do find the environment of the male-\ndominated computer classroom unsavoury.\nSo what about the boys? According to Bob Lingard (1998), of the University of\nQueensland, this refrain is an attempt to argue that masculinity is under siege and men are\ndisadvantaged. Peter Zohrab (1999) echoes his'concerns in New Zealand and claims that\nmen are already being scared away from some professions. We feel that if there is to be a\ndebate about the recuperative men's movement for learmng or that girls are being\nshortchanged (Kleinfeld, 1998), it should focus on adjusting antisocial behaviour in the\nreal or virtual classroom, thereby arresting the underachievement of a few of our youth.\nAnother reason why women may be more successful with online learning is that they set\naside a weekly time to learn when interruptions will be kept to a minimum. When asked in\n10\nAn-J Volume 9 Number 2\nfocus groups 'when is the best time to be working online', our mature students tell us, 'late\nat night' or 'early in the morning', that is, when the family are not around and\/or chores are\ncompleted. Conversely younger male students tell us they study 'any time'. In other words\nthey do not plan quiet times, their login pattern is irregular with a shorter time-span and\nscattered frequency. Again, even in our in-class experience in this and other courses, we\nnote that women tend to progress quietly through a set of linear instructions whilst the\nmen jump ahead and are frequently in trouble.\nAlong with self-regulated task-focused learning, according to Corno and Mandinach\n(reported by Kohe), another attribute of online learning is 'resource management'. This is\nmore relevant to the life experience of mature women, who, in their day-to-day\norganization of family matters, become adept at short-term management of events, which\ndo not require extended mental effort. This type of management depends on family co-\noperation and the ability to juggle several smaller tasks within the same time frame.4 Could\nit be that women advantaged by this skill have the ability to develop cognitive flexibility in\ntheir learning styles? Has this 'training', necessary for dealing with small family crises,\nequipped them and some of our mature men to adapt to a piecemeal, event-interrupted\nregime of self-regulated learning? If mature people are more adept at resource\nmanagement with background and foreground task-swopping, how can we transfer these\nskills to our younger male students who have not yet had the opportunity to develop such\nskills? As Campbell (1997) found, focus, motivation and time-management skills displayed\nby a number of her students equated with success for learning online. Lack of educational\nfocus led to side-tracking.\nWe have found that the attributes for successful online learning include 'self-regulated\nlearning' and being able to multi-task - dealing with interruptions and events then\nrescheduling as necessary. The student must then be able to re-focus quickly and continue\nworking. The home environment as a learning space may not be conducive to this kind of\nscheduling. Self-regulated learning can be difficult when minor family emergencies occur.\nA final reason that may also be influential on our course is the students' belief in their own\nperformance. We record the students' belief about their ability to perform the tasks ahead\nonline. The genders present a disparate picture regarding their perceived abilities to learn\nonline. More young men believe that they have Internet and HTML experience than the\nwomen. In our first session we give everyone the opportunity to take part in the online-\nonly course. Of the younger males (18-20) who choose this manner of learning, the\nmajority are confident of their success. Like Selby et al. (1997) we have found that mature\nwomen who choose learning online do not exhibit the same confidence. We counsel the\nclass to reflect on their learning styles and time-management skills, whilst reminding them\nthat they can always contact us, or if they change their mind, attend on-campus sessions.\nThe mature group is more self-efFacing about their perceived skill-set and, as Kerlin\nsuggests, this can be predicated by a large range of competencies or personal attributes that\nmight include age, gender and ethnic background.\nMost of our ethnic women and the majority of the mature ethnic males choose campus-\nbased learning, whilst a number of mature New Zealand women choose online off-campus\nlearning because of family commitments. The research of Margolis et al. (1998) indicates\nthat, although the ethnic group they studied in Canada may suffer from dismay and loss of\nII\nMae McSporran and Swart Young Does gender matter in online learning?\nconfidence about their perceived skills compared with the males in the class, they overcame\nthis by tenacity and stayed in computing. Another theory could be that they do not display\nthe English-language skill which allows their locally born female classmates to transfer to\nother disciplines. So they simply stay in IT through lack of choice as we have observed in\nthe New Zealand environment.5\nShould we filter out the over-confident students, take them aside and tell them that 'in our\nexperience' their group has been less successful than their cohorts who are less confident\nbut work harder? Should we insist that they become F2F learners? Or, do we supply extra\ntuition on how to 'learn successfully online'. In our opinion the first option is flawed\nbecause not all the young men need the extra help to become self-regulated learners. As we\nconstantly strive to allow choice, we will keep a wary eye out for evidence of non-\nperformance and attempt to motivate and enthuse via feedback whilst offering extra\ntuition to prepare all our students for this new technology-assisted delivery.\nConclusion\nMature New Zealand women have the study skills necessary for learning online. The basic\nskills of self-regulation and time management would appear to be underdeveloped within\nthe group of young males learning online. This is evidenced by non-performance in our\nonline self-assessment quizzes, assessment results and site usage. The mature women who\nhave these skills choose to work online because of convenience, flexibility and 'computing\nfor a purpose'. There is evidence that for some learners the online system is complimentary\nrather than a replacement (Anderson, 1997; Richie, 1997).\nThis paper is a platform for discussion of the implications of online learning for both\ngenders. There is a need for more research on who is more successful learning online, not\nonly for marketing purposes but so that we, as online instructors, can facilitate the transfer\nof the necessary skills to all participants whatever their gender, age or ethnicity. The\ninvestment in hardware, software and time by both institution and learner is high enough\nto warrant research on who learns best and how everyone can benefit from this new\nteaching and learning approach.\nAcknowledgements\nOur thanks to all the IWD students.
