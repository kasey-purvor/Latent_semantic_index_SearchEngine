Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) C. Delamination  \n \n1 INTRODUCTION \nThe increasing use of polymer matrix composite materials in newly designed aircraft and motor \nvehicles bears witness to the increasing confidence in their use.  Examples of design commitment \nto the use of composites in load-bearing aircraft structures are the keel beam of the Airbus A340-\n600, which resulted in the required weight saving [1], and the centre wingbox of the new A380.  \nThe new Boeing 7E7 is intended to contain a considerably higher proportion of composite in its \nstructure than has been used on any equivalent aircraft so far.  Damage tolerant design of such \nlarge structures must involve an understanding of crack growth management to achieve the \ndesired safe life and specific performance of the structure, at an acceptable cost. \n \nIn the Formula 1 industry, stiffness, strength and weight distribution are critical to the \nperformance of the racing car. Composites are the material of choice for their high specific \nstrength and stiffness but also for the short lead times in the manufacture of small numbers of \nnovel and relatively complex aerodynamic shapes. As in the aircraft case,  the limiting factors on \nmost structural parts in a F1 racing car are rarely the loading conditions experienced during their \n\u201cstandard\u201d life, but more extreme loading conditions imposed by the FIA (Federation \nInternational d\u2019Automobile).  There are stringent and increasingly demanding regulatory \nconditions, to make the cars safer for the drivers and for the spectators. Any damage created \nduring the race must be contained and the car must be able to finish the race [2].   \nAll composite structures contain cracks, their existence being only a matter of scale.  The \nmanagement of these cracks is thus a key issue.  Any modification of the composite structures \nwhich provides reliable and reproducible means of stopping delamination cracks would be \nexpected to be of interest. At the present time several 3D technologies are under investigation in \nthis context, namely: - stitching, tufting, 3D weaving and Z-Fiber\u00ae reinforcement [3].  This \npaper is concerned solely with Z-Fiber\u00ae reinforcement., thereafter referred to as Z-pinning [4]. \nFor the measurements reported in this paper, two basic types of test specimens were prepared: \ndouble cantilever beam specimens of dimensions within the range of the currently specified \ndelamination testing procedures and short beams of composite for the newly designed \u2018Z-shear\u2019 \ntest (see section 3.4).  In both cases, blocks of orthogonally inserted Z-pins are located in selected \npositions along the laminate beams. The 0.28mm and 0.51 mm diameter Z-pins used in this work \nhave been manufactured in the form of a continuous rod-stock, by a pultrusion batch process \nfrom 1k or 3k carbon fibre tows and cured to contain about 30% by volume of bismaleimide \n(BMI) resin. The high glass transition temperature of the fully cured BMI resin ensures that the \nZ-pins remain rigid throughout all subsequent manufacturing steps. Practical details of composite \nsample preparation are given elsewhere [4,5],  but the essence of the procedure is as follows:  \n- Cured carbon fibre\/ BMI resin Z-pins are provided by the manufacturer in the form of \nsquare array strips of Z-pins inserted into a double layer foam (Fig.1).   \n- The strip of Z-pins is placed in a selected location, on top of an uncured laminate and \npins are inserted with the aid of an ultrasonic gun [6]. The high frequency\/low amplitude \noscillations of the ultrasound gun cause enough energy to be absorbed by the uncured \nprepreg to allow the resin to heat up and soften. Direct pressure application onto the \ninsertion gun makes the orthogonal Z-pins slip easily in between the reinforcement fibres \nof the laminate, causing minimal damage.  \n- The collapsed foam and any excess length of Z-pins left on the surface of the laminate are \nsheared off by a metal tool and the laminate is bagged and cured in the normal fashion. A \ngood surface finish, a good bond to and a seal around the inserted Z-pins are achieved as \nthe resin flows during the cure process. \nThere is a range of preforms available, each characterised by the diameter of the Z-pins, the areal \ndensity of Z-pinning and the initial length of Z-pins.  This paper reports data from a range of \nprepreg raw materials and samples reinforced to varying degrees by the Z-pinning process.  All \nthe prepregs used in this investigation were provided by Hexcel Composites (UK), located in \nDuxford nr. Cambridge; the Z-pin preforms were provided by Aztex Inc., located nr. Boston, \nMA, USA. \nThe following code is adopted for sample identification:   \n- CF type\/Resin type\/Areal density of Z-pinning \/Z-pin diameter  \nFor the purposes of this paper, the data presentation is subdivided by the dominant applied mode \nof loading on the sample, namely Mode I and Mode II. \n \n2 RESPONSE TO MODE I LOADING \nThe Mode I delamination testing of composite laminated beams is facilitated by the existence of a \nstandard test protocol and data analysis, ISO15024. Our testing was carried out at a constant \ncrosshead speed of 1 mm\/min.  Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens were made, containing \na block of Z-pins (at least 25mm in length) located at 5 mm beyond the end of the crack starter \nfilm.  Thus the crack initiation values obtained are identical to those obtained from control \nsamples of the same composite.  However, thereafter, the way in which the crack propagates is \naffected greatly by the presence of the Z-pins, as indicated in Fig.2. In the case of the \nunidirectional IMS\/924 beams the nature of the crack propagation is changed from a stable and \nsteady nature in the control samples to \u2018stick \u2013 slip\u2019 behaviour in the Z-pinned samples.  The \ncrack gets stopped shortly after passing through a row of Z-pins, in a manner analogous to the \nclassical \u2018crack-pinning\u2019 in particulate composites.  The Z-pins then act in the wake of the \ndelamination front, bridging the crack as they gradually debond and pull-out from the beam arms, \nas the crack opening displacement increases. This is the dominant mechanism of energy \nabsorption associated with the presence of the Z-pins in these specimens. It should be noted that \nthe surface area of frictional contact, per length of crack, is greater in the case of 2%\/0.28 mm \nspecimens than in the 2%\/0.51 specimens, which explains the significant difference between the \ndelamination responses of these two samples. Once the crack has passed beyond the Z-pinned \narea (corresponding to crack lengths between 75 and 80 mm, depending on the exact geometry of \neach specimen), the resistance to crack propagation begins to fall again as the crack bridging \nforce created by friction between the Z-pins and the beam arms reduces in proportion to the \nreducing surface area of contact. \nThe micrograph in Fig.3 shows three individual Z-pins, one ahead of the crack the crack tip and \ntwo bridging a growing delamination in a Mode I specimen. The traction force exerted by a \nsingle Z-pin has been determined experimentally [4,5,7] and used in the development of FE \nmodels for the case of Mode I delamination in Z-pinned laminates [4,5,8,9].  The quality of the \nagreement between the experimental data and a simple 2D FE model of this problem, shown in \nFig.2, is very good because the \u2018a-posteriori\u2019 model takes into account all geometrical features of \nthe individual specimen.  Such \u2018local\u2019 FE model is intended to be used in a predictive sense for \nmore complex structures, where the geometry of localised Z-pinning reinforcement is fully \ndefined.  Detailed discussion of the FEA methods and results is beyond the scope of the present \npaper, and will be published in a future communication. \n \nIt is important to emphasise that the fracture toughness value in this context is not a material \nproperty, rather a specific \u2018material \u2013 structure\u2019 attribute. Analytical models describing the crack \nbridging actions of Z-pins in both Mode I and mixed Mode I \/ Mode II are in an advanced state of \ndevelopment [10-12]. Completed models of this type and\/or traction laws determined by \nmeasurements on representative single pin specimens are needed for more \u2018zonal \u2013 global\u2019 \nmodelling of the structural response of any Z-pin containing elements.  \n \n3 RESPONSE TO MODE II LOADING.  \nNo internationally agreed standard is currently available for this test, although the sample \ndimensions and the basics of the test follow those used in the standard Mode I tests.  A particular \nproblem associated with the measurement is the determination of the correct position of the crack \ntip [13]. The extent to which the presence of the through-the-thickness reinforcement may \ninvalidate any of the particular approaches to the data reduction from this test is unknown.  The \nMode II toughness values quoted thereafter are termed \u2018apparent\u2019 toughness, to reflect the \nuncertainty in the validity of the determination.   \n \n3.1 3 point ENF test results \nThe most obvious effect of the presence of Z-pins in a pre-cracked laminate beam subjected to \nforward shear loading (Mode II) is shown by the load-displacement curves in Fig.4.  In the \ncommonly used 3point Edge Notched Fracture test configuration, the control sample deforms \nessentially elastically and fails in a catastrophic manner soon after reaching the maximum load.  \nIn contrast, the delamination crack in any of the Z-pinned samples grows in a stable manner and \nthe specimens withstand considerably higher loads than the control before the crack runs into the \ncentral loading pin and is stopped artificially.  The data reduction scheme used to generate the R-\ncurves shown in Fig.5. is the so called \u2018experimental compliance calibration\u2019 method. The change \nin compliance with crack length for any given specimen is determined in a separate experiment , \nprior to fracture testing.  Whilst the absolute values of \u2018GIIC\u2019 cannot be used for anything other \nthat comparative purposes, it is apparent from these results that a much increased resistance to \ncrack propagation may be expected to result from the action of the Z-pins on the cracking beam \nunder these particular loading conditions. \nFig. 6 is a side view of the deformation of Z-pins under load, in a miniaturised Z-pinned beam \nunder 3point ENF loading.  The Z-pin is able to bend into an S-shape and appears to be pulling \naway from the top surface of the composite arm. For this to be possible, it is assumed that the Z-\npin would have debonded from the surrounding composite.   It is to be noted that an observable \nopening of the delamination crack exists, indicating a significant contribution of crack opening in \nthe loading spectrum of this sample.  This point becomes relevant in the following sections. \n \n3.3 Double lap shear joint \nA double lap shear joint, of a configuration shown in Fig.7, was made from Woven T300\/M21 \nprepreg and the overlaps were reinforced with 2%\/0.51 mm Z-pin blocks.  The crack starter areas \n(see Fig.7) were released by the inclusion of the same crack starter film as used in the DCB tests, \nto minimise the chance of high elastic energy being stored at a blunt crack tip and subsequent \ntotally catastrophic failure.  When tested in longitudinal tension, this type of specimen showed no \nimprovement over the control (unpinned) sample, in terms of the load carrying capability or of \nthe strain to failure.  There is an obvious need to reconcile this observation with the results shown \nin section 3.2. \nThe relatively thick (6mm) double lap shear joint has a low compliance, compared to the 3mm \nthick standard DCB beams.  There is clearly a considerable stress concentration at the corners \nand the crack propagation has to be expected to be rapid, in comparison with the DCB tests.  \nNevertheless, some effect of the bridging action of the Z-pins may have been expected.    \nThe hypothesis is that the crack opening displacement, visible in the DCB samples of Fig. 6, is \nseverely limited in the thick double lap shear specimen.  Thus the Z-pins may not be able to pull \nout from the specimen arms and will fail by transverse shear only. \n \n3.4   \u2018Z-shear\u2019 test \nA new form of mechanical test was developed in the authors\u2019 laboratory, designed to investigate \nthe above hypothesis. The essence of this new \u2018Z-shear\u2019 test is described by Fig. 8. The test rig \nimposes shear loading onto a block of Z-pins contained in a composite specimen while \nconstraining the allowed opening displacement.  The upper part of the rig is fixed to the load cell \nand held in place by a steel loading pin and a locking nut. The downward motion of the lower \npart introduces the shearing load. To prevent damage of the load cell, as well as any errors in the \nmeasurement due to any unwanted lateral loads, a rolling steel cylinder is added to the upper part \nof the rig supported only by contact forces against a rigid extension of the machine frame. No \nadditional friction forces are imposed on the load cell as the cylinder is free to move and rotate. \nThe sliding displacement is measured using both the crosshead extension and a clip gauge.  \n \nIt is important to note that the cured specimens have an insert film in the mid- plane and are thus \nheld together only by the bridging Z-pins. Two different laminate fibre architectures were \ninvestigated, using UD IM7\/M21 and Woven T300\/M21 prepregs.  Nominal specimen thickness \nis 6.6mm for Woven T300\/M21, and 6mm for UD IM7\/M21. The Z-pin insertion direction was \nensured to be normal to the plane of the specimen. Combinations of different Z-pin densities and \nZ-pin diameters were considered. The maximum number of Z-pins contained in each specimen \nwas dictated by the capacity of the 5kN load cell used. The measured resistance force is \nnormalised by the number of pins in the presentation of the results. Representative data are \nshown in Fig.9 in the form of normalised load-displacement traces.  There is a striking difference \nbetween the response obtained from unidirectionally reinforced Z-pinned specimens and woven \nfabric Z-pinned specimens. The maximum load per pin which the specimen can carry is higher \nfor the larger diameter pins (as expected). For a given pin diameter the maximum load is about \ndouble in the case of the woven fabric substrate samples, compared to the UD samples.  \nHowever, the lower load, carried by the UD samples, can be carried over a considerably greater \nsliding displacement.  Fig.10 displays SEM images of failed 0.28mm diameter Z-pins for the UD \nand the woven fabric samples.  The Z-pin is able to plough through the resin rich area within its \nown resin pocket in a UD sample, while its movement is significantly constrained within the \nwoven fabric sample. Extensive internal splitting and pullout of the individual fibres constituting \nthe Z-pin is evident in the UD sample; a transverse shear type of failure dominates the failure of \nthe Z-pin in the woven fabric sample. \n \n4 DISCUSSION \nThe test methods relating to the crack opening (Mode I) loading case are developed sufficiently \nto provide reliable data for analytical or FE models of localised behaviour in Z-pinned structures. \nA further improvement of the accompanying data analysis is underway, using lateral stress \ndistributions around the crack tip to mimic a distributed action by localised bridging elements \n[14]. The successful treatment of the Mode I loading case is largely due to the dominance of a \nsingle simple micromechanical mode of failure, namely Z-pin debonding and pullout, on the \nenergy absorption under Mode I loading conditions. This dominance is in part a consequence of \nthe fact that the energy associated with Mode I cracking of the resin itself is considerably lower \nthat the energy associated with the pin debond and pullout.  \nIn contrast, the response of a Z-pinned laminate to shear loading (nominally Mode II) is a \ncomplex superposition of the crack propagation resistance of the resin matrix itself (roughly five \ntimes higher than in the Mode I case) and of a multiplicity of failure micro-mechanisms of the Z-\npins bridging the crack.  From the above presented findings, it appears that the response of Z-\npinned composite specimens to (nominally) Mode II loading depends strongly upon the crack \nopening displacement and on the fibre reinforcement material type.  The crack opening constraint \ncan be expected to be dependent mainly on the testing fixture, but there is evidence to suggest \nthat the Z-pins themselves contribute to the crack opening displacement, by pushing the crack \nfaces apart.    \nAs a more general case Fig.11 illustrates the spectrum of failure types that a single Z-pin can \nundergo under shearing loading conditions. Ideally, the pair of shearing forces lies on parallel \naxes marginally distanced from each other. As the distance between them increases, the ratio of \nbending to shear (of the Z-pin) increases. The distance between the applied forces depends on the \nply geometry of the laminate. A resin rich area surrounds the Z-pin. The Z-pin can crush the resin \nand plough into the resin rich area under lateral loading. Laminate fibres at a 0\u00b0 angle relative to \nthe lateral displacement of the Z-pin provide little constraint, while fibres at a 90\u00b0 angle provide \nthe most. The amount of constraint will therefore vary with fibre orientation above and below the \ndisplacement (or delamination) plane. This would explain the significant difference in the extent \nof Z-pin \u2018ploughing\u2019 noted between woven fabric and UD specimens. \nThe highly orthotropic properties of the Z-pins tend to favour failure in longitudinal shear \n(splitting) under lateral loading. Splitting separates the Z-pin into numerous individual fibre \nbundles or even individual fibres. Since the diameter of each Z-pin constituent fibre is \nsignificantly smaller than the Z-pin diameter (7-10\u00b5m compared to 0.28 or 0.51 mm), the \nbending to shear loading ratio increases further. If a debonded Z-pin undergoes initial pullout, the \nchange in the frictional traction on the Z-pin as it is pressed against the constraining laminate \n(also called \u2018snubbing\u2019 effect [12]), will limit further pullout. Many samples show delamination \nplanes with failed Z-pins protruding marginally from both fractured surfaces. \nIn conclusion, it appears that the failure micromechanisms in Z-pinned specimens, under a \ncombination of lateral and longitudinal displacements, are a complex combination of Z-pin \npullout, fibre fracture, resin fracture and resin crushing. The total energy absorption involved in \nthe failure process then depends upon this balance. Further work is underway in the authors\u2019 \nlaboratory to quantify the relative contributions of each of the failure micromechanisms to the \noverall delamination process.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work reported here was funded by DTI CARAD program and by EPSRC (GR\/R 90369), via \nFaraday Advanced. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
