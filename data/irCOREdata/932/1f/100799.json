Such applications\ninclude the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices\nfor the detection of rare cells, the testing of water quality for\nthe detection of micro-organisms, and the monitoring of the\nenvironment for the detection of bioweapons such as anthrax.\nIn order to detect such particles, a highly sensitive biosensor\nmust be employed. Many biosensors technologies involve the\ndetection of particles adsorbed on a surface. These methods,\nincluding examples such as evanescent light scattering and\nsurface plasmon resonance [1], [2], require that the particle to\nbe detected be captured onto the surface of the sensor for\ndetection. However, the effectiveness of such detection meth-\nods can be limited when used to detect colloidal bioparticles,\nsince low particle concentrations and dominance of effects\nsuch as buoyancy or Brownian motion can limit the contact\nbetween sensor surface and particle.\nDielectrophoresis is the motion of particles caused by\ninduced polarization effects in inhomogeneous electric fields\n[3]\u2013[5]. Depending on the electrical properties of the medium\nand the particle, it can be attractive or repulsive, which we\nterm positive and negative dielectrophoresis respectively. In\nthe case of positive dielectrophoresis, the particle moves\ntoward the greater field inhomogeneity, and in negative dielec-\ntrophoresis it moves away from the field inhomogeneity.\nSince electrodes induce the electric field, the field inhomo-\ngeneity is greatest at the edges of the electrodes; therefore, the\nparticles move either toward or away from the electrodes.\nUsed for a range of biomedical settings including the manipu-\nlation of bacteria (e.g., [6]\u2013[8]), viruses (e.g., [9]\u2013[11]), and\ncells such as cancers and algae (e.g., [12]\u2013[15]), the technique\nhas been used in conjunction with methods such as bulk light\nscattering [16] and evanescent light scattering [17] to detect\nthe motion of particles. However, conventional dielec-\ntrophoretic methods also present limitations. Where the parti-\ncles are attracted to the surface on which microelectrodes have\nbeen patterned, the collection generally occurs along the edge\nof the electrodes; many sensing devices require collection to\ntake place primarily on top of the electrode (metal) surface\n(e.g., [1]). Secondly, since field inhomogeneity reduces rapid-\nly with distance from the electrode edge, the trapping of small\nparticles (e.g., bacteria and viruses) has in the past only taken\nplace using electrodes with very fine structures (sometimes of\nthe order of a few \u00b5m) and very constrained volumes in which\nthe particles can be detected (of the order of a few nanoliters).\nIn addition to dielectrophoretic forces, another form of\nbehavior is observed in particle solutions when exposed to\nlower-frequency nonuniform fields. This phenomenon occurs\ndue to a combination of dielectrophoresis and ac-electrohydro-\ndynamic flow (EHD); first observed by Pethig et al. [18] to\ncause particles to collect on electrode surfaces, it was original-\nly referred to as \u201canomalous dielectrophoresis.\u201d Later work by\nGreen and Morgan [19] showed that the effect could be attrib-\nuted to a balance between dielectrophoretic forces and fluid\nflow in the bulk medium, which occurs due to electro-osmoti-\ncally induced motion of charge in the electrical double layer\nacross the electrode surface. This effect appears at relatively\nlow frequencies (<100 kHz) and is perpendicular to the elec-\ntrode edge, driving fluid onto the electrodes. In practice, this\nforms a vortex of liquid over the electrode edge [20].\nIn this article we present electrode structures that combine\ndielectrophoretic effects with electrohydrodynamic fluid flow\nto concentrate particles on active sensor surfaces, using elec-\ntrodes up to 1 mm across. By construction of electrodes that\npromote combined EHD\/DEP vortices at electrode edges, par-\nticles are \u201cpulled\u201d out of the bulk liquid in a downdraft above\nthe electrode edge and inwards along the electrode surface,\nconcentrating them on the electrode surface. Since the effect\ncauses a bulk flow in the liquid, the particle collection is inde-\npendent of the particle size and a wide range of particles can\nbe collected. To optimize the collection effect on a surface, a\nnovel electrode configuration called \u201czipper electrodes\u201d has\nbeen developed. Zipper electrodes consist of an array of inter-\nlocking, approximately circular electrode pads.\nElectrohydrodynamic forces draw liquid inwards form all\nsides and thereby focus particles into the center of each pad\nfor detection. The size of the single pad can be significantly\nlarger than conventional dielectrophoretic devices since EHD\nforces affect a much larger volume than dielectrophoretic\nforce. Since the liquid vortex extends further into the medium\nthan the electric field, a significantly larger volume can be\nprobed than by dielectrophoresis alone.

In this case, a strong updraft forms over the\ncenter of the pad lifting particles off the surface again. In an\nintegrated sensor device, antibodies could trap the analytes as\nthey are carried over the surface, while contamination such as\ndust or other bacteria would be removed from the surface by\nthe updraft. This could be used to improve the signal-to-noise\nratio of an integrated device, since unwanted particles are\nreturned faster into the bulk medium than by diffusion alone.\nTheory\nDielectrophoresis, the phenomenon of induced motion in par-\nticles suspended in nonuniform electric fields [3]\u2013[5], is well\ncharacterized and understood. However, in addition to this\nphenomenon, other electrokinetic phenomena exist that exhib-\nit themselves under similar circumstances to those usually\nused for dielectrophoresis\u2014that is, using particles suspended\nin ionic aqueous media and using planar electrode arrays. One\nsuch phenomenon is the induction of fluid flow across the\nelectrode surfaces, which causes particles collecting by dielec-\ntrophoresis to move over the electrodes. This effect was first\nobserved in 1988 and described by Price et al. [21], who noted\nin early experiments using planar electrodes that, at low fre-\nquencies, particles trapped by positive dielectrophoresis\nmoved to form diamond-shaped aggregations on the upper\nsurface of the electrode arrays. Investigations of the electric\nfield across the electrode array surface [22] determined that\nthese diamond-shaped areas corresponded both in location and\nshape to regions of low electric field strength, and it was thus\nattributed to being due to an unexplained form of negative\ndielectrophoresis. Particle collection due to combined dielec-\ntrophoretic\/fluid flow phenomena were subsequently\ndescribed by Pethig et al. in 1992, where cells were observed\nto collect on the upper edges of castellated electrode structures\nat low frequency [18]. This behavior was attributed to an\nunknown dielectrophoretic effect and dubbed \u201canomalous\ndielectrophoresis.\u201d The effect was revisited and explained by\nGreen and Morgan [19] as being due to the balance of dielec-\ntrophoretic force and the action of fluid flow. The source of\nthis fluid flow was revealed by Ramos et al. [23], who\ndescribed how the electric field generated by planar electrodes\nis such that field lines pass through the electrical double layer\nsurrounding the electrodes tangentially; this can be considered\nto consist of a component orthogonal to the electrode surface,\nplus a second component, parallel to the surface, which acts to\nmove the charge accumulated in the double layer, creating an\nelectro-osmotic flow.\nWhen particles collect on planar electrode arrays by dielec-\ntrophoresis alone, they do so at the points of highest electric\nfield strength; that is, at the edges of the electrodes. However,\nas frequency is decreased, fluid flow due to electro-osmosis\nbecomes increasingly prominent; as described above, the loca-\ntion where this is strongest is where the electric field intercepts\nthe double layer at the sharpest angle, which is across the elec-\ntrode surfaces where the electrodes are closest together.\nTherefore, those particles that have collected by positive\ndielectrophoresis are those that experience the greatest fluid\nmotion, causing them to be \u201cswept back\u201d on to the electrode\nsurface. As they move further from the electrode edge, the\nangle of the electric field becomes more orthogonal and the\nfluid flow diminishes, and eventually a \u201cneutral point\u201d is\nreached where the two processes are in equilibrium and the\nparticles remain at rest; this is at the center of the array and is\nresponsible for anomalous collection behavior. The effect was\nactually used by Green and Morgan [19] to demonstrate that\nthe phenomenon could be used on micro-arrays to separate\ntwo sizes of nanoparticle.\nThe fluid-flow effect is frequency dependent, being\nstrongest at low frequencies where the double layer has time\nto form, diminish, and reform with opposing polarity for every\ncycle of the electric field, but becoming limited at high fre-\nquencies where the electrode polarity changes too fast for the\ndouble layer to transport electro-osmotically. Ramos et al. [23]\nFig. 1. The particle collection phenomenon originally referred\nto as \u201canomalous dielectrophoresis\u201d is principally driven by\nbulk flow of liquid at the electrodes. The fluid flow is driven by\nthe liquid in the electrical double layer (contained in the first\nfew nanometers above the electrode surface) being swept\naway from the electrode edge. Liquid flows inward, perpen-\ndicular to the electrode edges, to replace that pumped\naway by EHD. The liquid flows upwards further away from the\nelectrode edge and forms a vortex above the electrode\nedge that pulls particles out of the bulk liquid; dielec-\ntrophoresis then pulls them from the liquid, where they move\nacross the electrode surface. Since the updraft over the\nelectrode surface is much weaker than the downdraft over\nthe edge, most particles do not lift off the surface but collect\nin a band parallel to the electrode edge.\n0\u00b0 180\u00b0\nSignal\nGenerator\nWe have devised electrode structures\nconsisting of near-circular teardrop\nstructures, interlocking in such a way as\nto form a \u201czipper-like\u201d array.\n69\n22-emb06-hoettges.qxd  2\/5\/04  2:25 PM  Page 69\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

[24] demonstrated that the\nvelocity profile v of the fluid, and hence the particles, follows\na bell-shaped frequency dependence governed by the expres-\nsion [23]\nv = 1\n8\n\u03b5V2o \u00032\n\u03b7x\n(\n1 + \u00032)2\nwhere \u03b5 represents the permittivity of the medium, Vo is the\npotential applied to the electrodes, \u03b7 is the viscosity of the\nmedium, x is the distance from the center of the inter-elec-\ntrode gap, and \u0003 is a parameter given by the expression\n\u0003 = \u03c9x\u03ba\u03b5\u03c0\n2\u03c3\nwhere \u03c9 is the electric field frequency, \u03c3 represents the\nconductivity of the medium, and \u03ba is the reciprocal double\nlayer thickness.\nSince the direction of flow is dictated by the direction of the\nelectric field vector, the fluid motion is always directed\northogonally to the electrode edges, forming a loop pattern as\nshown in Figure 1. In order to maximize the effect of com-\nbined DEP\/EHD, we have developed electrode structures that\nare capable of focussing particles across a large area toward a\ncentral spot. Ideally, such a focusing structure would consist\nof two electrodes, an inner circular \u201cpad\u201d and an outer ring\nbordering the inner at a set distance. However, such a struc-\nture would require multilaminate microfabrication and may\npotentially be beset with capacitive losses between upper and\nlower electrodes; it would also be inefficient since collection\nover the edge of the outer electrode would not be controlled.\nTo overcome these problems, we have devised electrode\nstructures consisting of near-circular teardrop structures, inter-\nlocking in such a way as to form a \u201czipper-like\u201d array such as\nthat shown in Figure 2. Such an array allows the concentration\nof particles onto a series of interlocked \u201cpad\u201d structures that\ncan be patterned across an entire array, without the need for\ncomplex fabrication procedures.\nExperimental Setup\nZipper electrodes were manufactured in a range\nof sizes by photolithography and wet etching, for\noptical observations from ITO 4\u20138 \u0003m (Delta\nTechnologies, USA) on glass with HCl 20%,\n55\u25e6C; for light scattering SPR in IBIS SPR sub-\nstrates (Windsor Scientific, Windsor, UK) gold\nwith titanium seed layer on glass with KI:I 2 .\nMasks were fabricated from photographic film as\ndescribed by Hoettges et al. [25] Electrode arrays\nwere constructed with an approximate circle\ndiameter of 230 \u00b5m, 380 \u00b5m, 575 \u00b5m, and\n750 \u00b5m and an inter-electrode gap of 100 \u00b5m.\nApproximately 40 \u00b5L of particle suspension was\nmicropippetted onto the electrode array and cov-\nered with a cover slip and observed using a\nNikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Particle collec-\ntion was observed and analyzed using a Photonic\nScience Coolview HS cooled camera and\nPhotoLite software. Electrodes were energized\nusing a Thurlby-Thandar signal generator, pro-\nviding 10 Vpk-pk over a range of frequencies.\nFig. 2.

Yeast\ncells were used to evaluate the behav-\nior of the system for cell-sized parti-\ncles. In order to evaluate the sensitivity\nof the system, controlled concentra-\ntions of BG spores between 5 \u00d7 108\nspores\/mL and 5 \u00d7 103 spores\/mL\nwere investigated in 10 mSm\u22121 solu-\ntions to evaluate the local increase in\nspore numbers in the center of the elec-\ntrode. BG spores were suspended in\nKCl solutions with a range of conduc-\ntivities between 1 mSm\u22121 and 100\nmSm\u22121. The distance from the edge at\nwhich spores were collected was mea-\nsured at a range of frequencies to find\noptimum conditions for different elec-\ntrode sizes and conductivities.\nResults and Discussion\nOn application of the electric field, vor-\ntices were observed to form along the\nelectrode edges. These vortices extend-\ned from the median line of the inter-\nelectrode gap for some hundreds of\nmicrons in either direction, causing a\nmoving \u201cfront\u201d of particles moving from their\noriginal positions, orthogonally away from the\nelectrode edges. Where the motion was on to the\nbus bar surrounding the zipper pad, the motion\ncontinued for several hundred microns; where the\nmotion was on the pad, particles were observed\nto rapidly coalesce onto the centre of the pad, as\nshown in Figure 3. The vortices were observed to\nextend high into the bulk liquid, attracting parti-\ncles from the volume enclosed between the pad\nand the top of the chamber (approximately\n100 \u00b5m). Particles trapped in the vortex were\nobserved to migrate from the center of the vortex\nto the outside, where they are attracted by dielec-\ntrophoretic forces to the electrode edge. After\npassing that edge, they move along the electrode\nsurface and collect, either at the center of the pad\nor in a line along the counter-electrode bus bar.\nExperiments with spores, yeast, and 110-nm\nbeads all demonstrated similar behavior and col-\nlection speed. The phenomenon is largely driven\nby the speed of fluid flow rather than the proper-\nties and dimensions of the particles themselves.\nThe size of the vortex can be estimated by\nmeasuring the distance between the region where\nthe particles collect and the electrode edge.\nHowever, in order to obtain reliable results this\ncan only be performed using larger electrodes,\nsince vortices form on all sides of the electrodes.\nIf the diameter of the electrode is too small, the\ntwo vortices will influence each other\u2019s shape. In\nour experiments the bus bars were used to have a\nlarge distance between the two edges and therefore to see an\nundisturbed front while the collection band in the electrode\nwas measured as well for comparison. This is illustrated in\nFigure 4(a), where the distance between particle front and\nelectrode edge is significantly larger on the bus bar than on the\nFig. 4. The size of the vortex determines how far from the electrode edge the parti-\ncles start to collect. However, since there is a synergistic effect from the vortices\naround the pad, it is impossible to measure the vortex size at low frequencies due to\nthe effects illustrated in Figure 4. However, since the bus bars have only one elec-\ntrode edge, it is possible to measure the vortex size directly for a given set of condi-\ntions. (a) Where the vortices overlap in the pad, it is possible to measure the front on\nthe bus bar, which can be seen here to be larger than the edge-front distance on\nthe electrode.

Instead, when the\ndiameter of the vortex at the electrode edge is approximately\nequal to, or larger than, the radius of the zipper pad, then the\nvortices will \u201ccollide\u201d in the middle of the electrode. When\nthis occurs, the velocity of the updraft increases and becomes\nstrong enough to lift particles off the surface. In this case the\nparticles collect in a small spot but are then lifted in the vortex\nand recirculated as shown schematically in Figure 5. After a\nshort time an equilibrium forms between particle deposition\nand lifting, and a small collection spot remains on the surface.\nIn a sensor device this might be used to increase selectivity.\nAn antibody-coated surface could be used to bind the surface\nto the spores the sensor is designed to detect, and particles that\ndo not bind to the antibody are quickly removed. However,\nthis effect can be only used on smaller electrodes\nas the observed vortices under the conditions\ndescribed have been insufficiently large to cause\nthis effect on the larger electrodes used. At a\nmedium conductivity of 10 mSm\u22121 the largest\nvortices observed were 220 \u00b5m, and pads with a\ndiameter of more than 500 \u00b5m will not generate\nvortices with sufficient radius to lift particles off\nthe surface using the signal amplitudes and fre-\nquencies described here. When the vortices are\nsignificantly smaller than the pad radius, parti-\ncles instead form a \u201cring\u201d around the electrode\nedge, as shown in Figure 4(b). The size of the\nvortex over the electrode edge is influenced by\nthe frequency of the applied field and the con-\nductivity of the medium. Reaching a maximum\nstrength at the electrode edge, the vortex effect\nextends a distance over the electrode surface that\nis independent of the electrode size. Therefore,\nthe frequency, voltage, and pad size can be opti-\nmized for a particular set of parameters. To\nachieve optimum collection in the center of the\npad, the electrode radius should be approximately\nthe same size as the distance the parti-\ncles are pushed by the vortex effect.\nSince the technique induces a bulk\nflow into the liquid, the size of the par-\nticle is less relevant. This offers an\nimportant advantage over other dielec-\ntrophoretic techniques. Since conven-\ntional dielectrophoretic force depends\non the volume of the particles, it is\nextremely weak for small particles such\nas viruses. To assess the effect of EHD\nforces on virus-sized particles, experi-\nments with fluorescently labeled latex\nbeads (110 nm diameter) were per-\nformed on zipper-electrodes. Even for\nthe small latex beads the zipper elec-\ntrodes worked extremely well and\npulled a large number of particles out\nof the liquid. The results also suggest\nthat the smaller particles get lifted off\nFig. 6.

This is a significant improvement\nover conventional DEP trapping methods, where\nthe electrodes required to trap nanoparticles must\nbe of the order of a few microns across in order\nfor trapping to take place [26]. The working vol-\nume over which the zipper electrodes are effec-\ntive in attracting particles to the electrode surface\nis of the order of tens or hundreds of nanoliters\nper electrode, representing an increase per elec-\ntrode array of perhaps three orders of magnitude\nover the quadrupole array previously used to trap\n100-nm particles by dielectrophoresis (e.g., [26]).\nIn order to quantify particle collection, controlled concen-\ntrations of BG spores in 10 mSm\u22121 solution were placed on\n500 \u00b5m electrodes and energized with a 10-Vpk-pk,1-kHz sig-\nnal. The number of particles counted per pad is shown in\nFigure 6. As can be seen, the number of particles collected\nincreases as an inverse exponential as particles from the sur-\nrounding region are depleted, though the collection number\nwas also found to be limited by the total size of the trap before\nbecoming saturated (as can be seen for the trace for 5 \u00d7 106\nparticles\/ml). In all cases, the increase in the number of parti-\ncles observed on the electrodes is in excess of an order of\nmagnitude. Collection was still possible for concentrations of\n5 \u00d7 103 spores\/ml, where 3\u20134 particles were found per pad;\noptimization of geometry and power characteristics should\npotentially allow the detection limit of 103 particles\/ml.\nThe pads also showed excellent recovery of particles from\nthe liquid. The recovery can be evaluated by calculating the\namount of particles the liquid directly above the electrode pad\ncontains and comparing this to the number of particles collect-\ned by that pad. The electrodes show recovery rates between\napproximately 90% and 120% after trapping for 10 min.\nRecovery rates in excess of 100% can be explained by the fact\nthat the volume from which an electrode can trap particles is\nactually greater than the volume directly above the pad. A sin-\ngle circular pad with a ring electrode has vortices not only on\nthe inner circle but also on the outer ring. These vortices on the\nring also pull liquid down over the inter-electrode gap. In this\nstream the inner and outer vortices merge and particles that\nwere in the outer vortex can diffuse into the inner one and visa\nversa. However, the vortex over the outer ring covers a larger\narea\/volume and can therefore collect a larger number of parti-\ncles. By random diffusion this may account for a slightly larger\nnumber of particles form the outer vortex diffusing into the\ninner one and thereby explain the high recovery rates. On zip-\nper electrodes there is no outer ring, but the bus bar on one side\ncan fulfill a similar function. This is also supported by the fact\nthat the pads at the corners of an array (where the bus bar that\nsurrounds them forms two sides) have a slightly higher collec-\ntion than the pads in the centre of the array.\nCombined DEP\/EHD Devices with\nEvanescent Light Scattering Detection\nAside from the increased capture volume over which particles\ncan be captured, the prime advantage of the zipper electrode\narray is that the particles are deposited at the center of a large\nmetal electrode, which makes the system ideal for detection\nmethods such as SPR or evanescent light scattering.\nFurthermore, the large pad size of the zipper electrodes\naddresses a second problem with etched electrodes in light-\nscattering systems: that of scatter from the electrode edges.\nPrevious studies using evanescent light-scattering techniques\nto observe dielectrophoresis [17] were impeded by the fact\nthat scatter from the electrode edge (where the particles col-\nlect) reduced the sensitivity of the system for the detection of\nsmall numbers of particles. In the case of the zipper elec-\ntrodes, the distance between the collection point and the elec-\ntrode edge (made possible by the larger electrode size) means\nthat optical detection equipment (e.g., camera or photomulti-\nplier) can focus on a detection region while the electrode\nedges are outside the region of observation.\nIn order to test this, IBIS SPR chips (Windsor Scientific,\nWindsor, UK) were modified by etching the electrode pattern\ninto the slides so as to cover an area in the center of the slide\napproximately 7 mm \u00d7 7 mm. The chips were fitted into an\nadapted flow cell to allow electrical connections to be made\nand this was then illuminated using a laser, using an adapted\nversion of instrumentation previously developed for combined\nlight scattering\/SPR detection [1]. A schematic of the \ncombined DEP\/EHD\/light scattering system is illustrated in\nFigure 7, and an example of an image of BG spores collected\nfrom a 1 \u00d7 105 solution using this equipment is shown in \nFigure 8. As can be seen, the system shows a high degree of\nlight scattering due to particles focussed at the center of the\nelectrode and darkness from the center of the electrode to the\nedge. There are two sources of artifacts in the image; the elec-\ntrode edge remains visible due to light scattering, and there is\nadditional scatter from particles illuminated by the laser pass-\ning through the inter-electrode gaps (this appears as a horse-\nshoe-shaped region in the bottom half of the image), though\nthis can be eliminated using a greater magnification on the\ncamera, or by optical masking. Simple enhancement of the\nimage can be performed by using black-white thresholding, as\nshown in Figure 8(c).\nConclusion\nIn order to address the shortcomings of conventional dielec-\ntrophoretic systems for enhancing biosensors\u2014including\nsmall working volume and collection on metal edges rather\nthan surfaces\u2014we have devised the new zipper-electrode\nstructures. These have shown to be highly effective in collect-\ning particles from suspension and depositing them on a small\nsurface. The local enrichment effect of these electrodes is such\nthat particles at local concentration of 5 \u00d7 103 spores\/mL can\nbe collected using a single electrode pad. The fluid flow\nFig. 8.

The bulk flow makes it also\na very versatile method that can extract a wide range of parti-\ncles out of the liquid. The mechanism of removing the parti-\ncles off the surface again with a strong updraft in the middle of\nthe electrode may be useful to wash clear away unwanted par-\nticles while analytes are held down by specific antibodies.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was carried out as part of the Human Systems\nTechnology Research Domain of the MoD Corporate\nResearch Programme.\nKai F.
