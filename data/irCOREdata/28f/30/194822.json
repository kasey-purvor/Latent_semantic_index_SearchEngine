J. Pinfield et al.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nLow-mass star and brown dwarf (BD) populations in open clusters\nmake excellent test-beds for our theoretical understanding of these\nobjects. With a well-constrained cluster age, and assuming uniform\ncomposition, we can effectively compare theoretical isochrones with\nobserved colour\u2013magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and two-colour dia-\ngrams without the complications introduced by a spread in metal-\nlicity and a range in surface gravities for a given mass. Furthermore,\nfor most open clusters, the depth effect is small, and the single star\nsequence is therefore quite tight on CMDs. It is thus possible to\nstudy unresolved binarity amongst cluster members.\nThe T eff range of young to intermediate age low-mass stars and\nBDs corresponds to M and L spectral types, and modelling the at-\nmospheres of such objects is very complicated. The convection zone\npenetrates deeply into the optically thin outer layers due to H2 dis-\nsociation (Burrows et al. 1993). Molecular opacities such as TiO\nand H2O comprise millions of lines that must be accurately mod-\nelled (Allard et al. 1997). Also, dust begins to form in atmospheres\nat around 2800 K (Allard et al. 2001), which depletes opacities as\nwell as affecting the atmospheric temperature gradient. There are\nmany different varieties of dust (Sharp & Huebner 1990), and their\nformation rates and grain size distributions will depend not only on\ntemperature, but on surface gravity and metallicity. Despite these\ncomplexities, much progress has been made in modelling these at-\nmospheres. The Lyon Group has combined structural models (using\ninterior structure physics) with model atmospheres (Hauschildt, Al-\nlard & Baron 1999; Allard et al. 2001) to calculate evolutionary\nmodels for low-mass stars and BDs, both with and without atmo-\nspheric dust condensates (Baraffe et al. 1998, hereafter NextGen;\nChabrier et al. 2000, hereafter Dusty). Calculations by other groups\ninclude those of Burrows et al. (1997), and D\u2019Antona & Mazzitelli\n(1994). However, only the Lyon group models are based on consis-\ntent non-grey evolutionary calculations relating the mass and age of\nan object to its observational properties (colour and magnitude).\nThe Pleiades and Praesepe are two nearby, rich open clusters\nwith near solar composition (Crawford & Perry 1976; Hambly et al.\n1995b). With distances of \u223c125 and 160 pc, respectively, both clus-\nters have small depth effects, and are fairly compact on the sky (a few\ndegrees across). The Pleiades is \u223c125 Myr old (Stauffer, Schultz &\nKirkpatrick 1998) and Praesepe is \u223c0.6\u20131.4 Gyr old (Hambly et al.\n1995b). Consequently, Pleiades low-mass stars (\u00010.3 M\u0006) and BDs\nare not fully contracted, and will have lower surface gravities than\ntheir equal T eff counterparts in Praesepe.\nIn this paper, we derive membership criteria of Pleiades and Prae-\nsepe low-mass star and BD candidates using near-infrared (NIR)\nphotometry and optical spectroscopy. We compare NextGen and\nDusty theoretical isochrones to our observed CMDs and two-colour\ndiagrams, and identify photometric ranges where the isochrones\nagree well with observations. We then join these isochrone sections\ntogether using additional empirical points, and discuss the overall\nform of the cluster sequences. We also use our CMDs and two-colour\ndiagrams to identify unresolved binaries. We derive binary fractions\nover several mass ranges in each cluster, and estimate mass ratios\nfor the Pleiades BD binaries. Finally, we discuss future work.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\n2.1 The Pleiades and Praesepe samples\nOur Pleiades and Praesepe samples were taken from several sources.\nFor the Pleiades, the highest-mass sources (I < 13.5) were taken\nfrom Hambly, Hawkins & Jameson (1993, HHJ hereafter). Fainter\nsources were taken from, the ITP survey (Zapatero-Osorio et al.\n1999), the CFHT survey (Bouvier et al. 1998), the Burrell Schmidt\nsurvey (Pinfield et al. 2000, BPL hereafter) and the INT WFC survey\n(Dobbie et al. 2002b). The fainter surveys cover a combined area\nof 7.6 deg2, and range in photometric depth from I = 19.5 to 21.8\n(unless otherwise stated, I refers to Cousins I). These fainter surveys\nare summarized in more detail in Jameson et al. (2002).\nOur Praesepe sample was taken from four surveys. Proper motion\nmembers from the 19 deg2 survey of Hambly et al. (1995a, hereafter\nHSHJ) represent our highest mass sources (I = 10\u201317.5). Lower-\nmass sources come from Pinfield et al. (1997), Pinfield (1997) and\nMagazzu et al. (1998). The Pinfield surveys covered 1 and 6 deg2,\nand reached I = 21 and 19.5, respectively. The Magazzu survey\ncovered 800 arcmin2 down to I = 21.2, and identified one BD\ncandidate, which they called Roque Pr 1.\n2.2 Photometry\nFor the brighter BPL and HSHJ candidates we obtained J -, H - and\nK-band magnitudes from the 2MASS second incremental point-\nsource catalogue at the NASA\/IPAC InfraRed Science Archive\n(Scrutskie et al. 1995). We used a search radius of 3 arcsec to allow\nfor positional uncertainties. For the ITP, CFHT and INT WFC sur-\nveys, we obtained photometry from the literature for as many sources\nas were available (see Jameson et al. 2002). Most of the fainter BPL\ncandidates had K-band measurements from Pinfield et al. (2000),\nand several Praesepe candidates had K-band measurements from\nHodgkin et al. (1999). For the remainder of these samples we mea-\nsured J-, H- and K-band photometry using UFTI on the United\nKingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, from\n2000 January 3 to 5, and in service time on 2001 October 8. The sky\nconditions were photometric. Our observing strategy for candidates\nwithout a K-band magnitude was to observe them first at K, and\nonly go on to measure J- and H-band magnitudes if the targets had\na sufficiently red I \u2212 K colour to be consistent with membership\nof the cluster. For the remaining candidates, we simply measured\nJ- and H-band magnitudes, as well as K band if the previous K un-\ncertainty was >0.1. Each observation comprised a five-point dither\npattern, with a windowed 512 \u00d7 512 pixel readout. Total integration\ntimes at each of J, H and K were 150, 300 and 540 s, for objects with\nI = 17\u201318.5, I = 18.5\u201320 and I > 20, respectively. The raw images\nwere de-biased, dark-subtracted, flat-fielded and combined into mo-\nsaics using ORACDR. Aperture photometry was then extracted using\nGAIA. As the UKIRT photometry was obtained with the \u2018Mauna Kea\nObservatory\u2019 (MKO) filter set (Simons & Tokunaga 2002), the pho-\ntometry from the literature was transformed into the MKO system\nusing the transforms of Hawarden et al. (2001) and Carpenter (2001)\n(old UKIRT system and 2MASS, respectively). The photometry is\ngiven in the appendices. Where there were multiple measurements\navailable for an object, we selected those with small errors (gener-\nally trying to avoid measurements with errors larger than \u223c0.1), and\ntook an average.\nOur optical photometry was taken from the literature. All I-band\nphotometry was transformed into the Cousins system. Photographic\nI N magnitudes from HSHJ were transformed using Bessell (1986).\nTo transform the I KP magnitudes of Pinfield (1997) and Pinfield\net al. (2000) we derived the following relation: I C \u2212 I KP = 0.049\n(I KP \u2212 K ) + 0.069 (for 2.3 < I C \u2212 K < 5.8). This relation was\nobtained using synthetic photometry derived from spectra, using the\nmethod and data from Dobbie et al. (2002a).\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\nBrown dwarfs and low-mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe 1243\n2.3 Spectroscopy\nWe obtained spectra of two BD candidates using ISIS on the 4.2-m\nWilliam Herschel Telescope (WHT) during 2001 January 29. The\nseeing was \u223c1.2 arcsec and the weather was clear. Our instrumental\nsetup comprised the TEK4 charge-coupled device (CCD) and the\nR158R grating on the ISIS red arm, with the mirror in place and\nno order blocking filters, so as to minimize flux losses (we expect\nsecond-order contamination for these red objects to be negligible).\nWe used a 1-arcsec slit, and integrated for 1800 s. This gave us a\nwavelength coverage of 6213\u20139193 A\u02da with a dispersion of 2.91 A\u02da\npixel\u22121.\nWe used IRAF to reduce our spectra. The CCD frames were bias-\nsubtracted and flat-fielded using standard routines, and the spectra\nextracted and sky-subtracted using the APALL routine. We calibrated\nthe wavelength scale using the CuAr arc lamp exposures, and the\nflux using observations of flux standard stars (available in the IRAF\nenvironment) on the same night, and with the same instrumental\nsetup.\n3 R E S U LT S A N D D I S C U S S I O N\n3.1 Pleiades spectra\nFig. 1 shows the spectra of the two Pleiades BD candidates BPL\n327 and BPL 45, where they have been normalized to unity at\n7500 A\u02da.

Also, the A-index of Kirkpatrick, Henry & McCarthy (1991)\nimplies a slightly earlier spectral type for both sources (dM6.5 and\ndM7.5 for BPL 327 and BPL 45, respectively), which is what we\nexpect for young sources that are not fully contracted. We also note\nthat the BPL 327 spectra shows that the I2 and I3 indices of Mart\u0131\u00b4n &\nKun (1996) (which measure the CaH and the TiO absorption bands,\nrespectively) continue to increase out to \u223cdM7, before turning over\nand decreasing to lower values by dM8. By comparing the I mag-\nnitudes and derived spectral types with the spectral type-magnitude\ndiagram of Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. (2000), we found that both BPL 327 and\nBPL 45 lie on the Pleiades sequence, and appear to be single BDs.\n3.2 The IK CMDs\nFigs 2 and 3 show the K , I \u2212 K CMDs (IK CMDs) for the Pleiades\nand Praesepe, respectively. Small filled circles are higher-mass\ncandidate members with 2MASS photometry, and proper motion\ncandidates from HSHJ in the Pleiades and Praesepe, respectively.\nWe have several additional fainter Praesepe candidates with 2MASS\nphotometry which are not plotted, since their errors are sizeable\n(see Table A4). Larger filled symbols are lower mass candidates\n(candidate BDs in the Pleiades), where circles have J- and H-band\nphotometry (triangles do not). Open circles (small and large) look\nlike background sources in these plots. Open diamonds and open\nsquares are probably old-disc non-members from the K , J \u2212 K\nCMDs (JK CMDs) and the J \u2212 H , H \u2212 K two-colour diagrams\n(JHK diagrams), respectively (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5). Circled\nobjects look like unresolved binaries in these plots (see below).\nObjects overplotted with an additional square or triangle are likely\nto be unresolved binaries from the JK CMDs and JHK diagrams.\nTypical photometric error bars are shown at the bottom left. The\nlocation of several magnitude bins are indicated with dotted lines\n(see Section 3.5). Solar metallicity NextGen and Dusty isochrones\nare overplotted as dashed lines, with mass points shown in units\nof 0.001 M\u0006. We also show higher-mass (>0.7 M\u0006) isochrones\nderived with a larger mixing length parameter (l = 1.9Hp), since\nthis parameter makes a significant difference at these higher masses\n(Chabrier & Baraffe 1997). In the Pleiades, we assume an age of\n125 Myr, AI = 0.06, AK = 0.05, and use the re-computed Hipparcos\ndistance modulus of (m \u2212 M)0 = 5.57 (Makarov 2002), which was\nderived in a way that reduces the propagation of along-scan attitude\nerrors, a source of discrepancy with the previous Hipparcos Pleiades\ndistance (e.g. van Leeuwen 1999). In Praesepe, we show both 0.5-\nand 1-Gyr isochrones, and assume (m \u2212 M)0 = 6.0 with zero ex-\ntinction. This distance modulus was obtained from a best fit of the\nNextGen isochrones to the good Praesepe candidates with UKIRT\nphotometry from I \u2212 K = 2.5 to 3.5. In this colour range the 0.5-\nand 1-Gyr isochrones lie on top of each other. This distance agrees\nwell with other values found from main-sequence fitting (Lynga\n1987; Nissen 1988), but is slightly lower than the Hipparcos value\nof 6.24 (Mermilliod et al. 1997). However, it is possible that the\npreviously mentioned attitude errors could affect the Hipparcos dis-\ntance of Praesepe.

Solid and dotted lines are the cluster\nsingle and binary star sequences, respectively.\ncluster sequences (constructed both from isochrone data and empir-\nical data), with their equal-mass binary sequences shown as dotted\nlines (see the subsequent discussion).\nWe will first discuss the brighter sources with 2MASS K-band\nphotometry. For the range K = 10.5\u201314 in the Pleiades and K =\n11\u201314.5 in Praesepe there is a known kink in the main sequence,\nwhere it becomes steeper. This feature is seen over a wide range\nof wavelengths (Reid & Cruz 2002), and is thought to result from\nH2 formation in the photosphere, lowering the adiabatic gradient\nand causing convection (Kroupa, Tout & Gilmore 1990). The re-\nsulting lower-temperature gradient then leads to increased T eff val-\nues, with the consequent reduction in the I \u2212 K colour, and turn\nover on the CMD. The kink is clearly seen in both cluster CMDs.\nFor Praesepe, the model isochrone follows the data very well (to\nwithin the photometric errors). However, for the Pleiades the data\nappear to be somewhat redder than the isochrones from K = 10.5\u201313\n(MK \u223c 5\u20137.5). In order to determine whether this effect is an artefact\nof the different photometric filter systems used, we have examined\nour photometry more closely. Photographic magnitudes (used in\nHHJ) and KittPeak magnitudes (used in Pinfield et al. 2000) were\nboth available for the Pleiades sources in this range, and by trans-\nforming both on to the Cousins system we looked for any systematic\ndifferences that could account for such an effect. However, no such\ndifferences were found, and the Pleiades sources looked redder than\nthe isochrones whichever I-band data were used. The Pleiades and\nFigure 3. The K , I \u2212 K CMD of Praesepe. Symbols are the same as in\nFig. 2.\nPraesepe sources in this range all have 2MASS K-band photome-\ntry (converted on to the MKO system), and so there should be no\nsystematic difference in this band. It thus seems unlikely that this\neffect is due to photometric inconsistencies.\nAssuming this effect is genuine, we should expect to see it\namongst other similar populations. The open cluster \u03b1Per has a\nsimilar age to the Pleiades (\u000480 Myr), and Fig. 4 shows an IK\nCMD of likely \u03b1Per members (filled circles) from Prosser (1992)\nand Barrado y Navascue\u00b4s et al. (2002). These have been corrected\nfor distance and reddening (m \u2212 M = 6.23, AI = 0.17, AK = 0.04;\nStauffer et al. 1999) for easy comparison with the field stars that are\nalso plotted (open circles; Reid & Cruz 2002). NextGen isochrones\nof 80 Myr and 1 Gyr are indicated by solid lines, and a dotted line\nindicates the expected spread due to binarity for \u03b1Per. It is clear that\n(despite some scatter) the 1-Gyr model isochrones represent the field\nstar data very well. However, the majority of the \u03b1Per sources from\nMK \u223c 5\u20137 are redder than both the single and the binary 80-Myr\nisochrones, and the same effect is therefore evident in \u03b1Per as well\nas the Pleiades.\nSo what could be causing this reddening? Variability could make\na source appear redder since the I- and K-band measurements were\nnot made simultaneously. However, sources could equally be flaring\nwhen the I- or K-band measurements were made, and the overall\neffect should be to simply broaden the sequence slightly, not shift it\nto the red. The magnetic activity of such youthful sources may, how-\never, provide the explanation for the reddening. Hawley, Tourtellot\n& Reid (1999) found that dMe stars in NGC 2516 (\u223cPleiades age)\nlay redward of the fiducual main sequence in an MV versus V \u2212 I\nCMD. They also found that some molecular bands respond strongly\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\nBrown dwarfs and low-mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe 1245\nFigure 4. The K , I \u2212 K CMD of Alpha-Per (filled circles) and field stars\n(open circles). Sources are taken from Prosser (1992), Barrado y Navascue\u00b4s\net al. (2002), and Reid & Cruz (2002).\nto the presence of a chromosphere, and concluded that the V \u2212 I\ncolour was affected by the presence of activity. The I \u2212 K colour\nand the V \u2212 I colour could be reddened by the same process. It\nmay seem surprising that photospheric bands (and the photomet-\nric colours they influence) should be affected by the presence of a\nchromosphere. However, modelling the correct form of the mag-\nnetic field that threads the atmospheres of these stars may allow us\nto account for these effects.\nBelow the kink the NextGen isochrone fits both cluster CMDs\nwell out to I \u2212 K \u223c 3.5, showing the expected decreasing T eff as\ndegeneracy sets in. For Praesepe, we defined our cluster sequence\nout to I \u2212 K \u00043.5 with the NextGen model isochrone, since it fits the\ndata very well in this range. We chose to do the same for the Pleiades\ndespite the sources being slightly redder than the isochrones for\nK = 10.5\u201313, since we do not expect the reddening to significantly\neffect the mass\u2013magnitude model predictions.\nAt redder colours we confine our discussion to the Pleiades, since\nwe only have a few good Praesepe candidates in this range. It can be\nseen that there is a fairly obvious gap in the Pleiades sequence from\nK \u0004 14.65 to 14.95 (at I \u2212 K \u0004 3.5) where the number of sources\nis severely reduced. The spectral type corresponding to the gap is\nM7 (see fig. 4 of Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 2000), and we refer to this feature\nas the \u2018M dwarf gap\u2019. It is discussed in more detail in Dobbie et al.\n(2002c). However, to summarize, we believe that it results from a\nsharp local drop in the magnitude\u2013mass relation, possibly caused\nby the formation of dust in the atmospheres of objects in this T eff\nregime. We measured the size of the gap at 0.3 in K, which compares\nwith \u223c0.5 in I (Dobbie et al. 2002c).\nBelow the Pleiades M dwarf gap (K \u0004 14.95\u201315.3) the single-\nsource candidates follow a fairly flat path in the CMD out to I \u2212\nK \u223c 4.1. There is then a turn down, where the candidates drop\non to the Dusty isochrone, joining it somewhere from I \u2212 K \u223c\n4.1 to 4.5. We estimated the path followed by the flat part of the\nsequence by averaging the colours and K-band magnitudes of two\ngroups of sources; the three bluest single sources and the three\nreddest single sources from K = 14.95\u201315.3 (below which the turn\ndown is obvious). And we estimated the colour where the sequence\njoins the Dusty isochrone as I \u2212 K \u223c 4.3. The Dusty isochrone\nthen agrees well with the five faintest Pleiades candidates out to I\n\u2212 K \u223c 6, so in this range we used the Dusty isochrones for our\nsequence.\nFor Praesepe, we have extended the cluster sequence beyond\nthe NextGen isochrones by assuming it has the same form as the\nPleiades sequence; the same M dwarf gap size, and the same flat\nportion that turns over and falls on to the Dusty isochrone by\nI \u2212 K \u223c 4.3. This may not be entirely accurate, but should act\nas a reasonable approximation.\nWe have flagged non-members in the Pleiades and Praesepe\nusing our cluster sequences as a guide, and allowing for pho-\ntometric uncertainties as well as the depth effect of the clusters\n(\u00b10.2 mag for the Pleiades and \u00b10.15 mag for Praesepe; Pinfield,\nJameson & Hodgkin 1998; Holland et al. 2000). We have also\nflagged likely unresolved binary members with UKIRT photometry,\nif they lie significantly (>0.25 mag) above the single-star sequence.\nWe duly identified 13 Pleiades binaries and eight Praesepe binaries\nin this way. We refer to them as IK binaries, and they are overplotted\nwith an open circle in the figures. We note that there is a degener-\nacy between mass and binarity where the IK sequence is dropping\ndown on to the Dusty isochrone (I \u2212 K = 3.9\u20134.5), and it is not\npossible to identify all binaries in this region from the IK CMD\nalone.\n3.3 Model J \u2212 K colours\nIn the previous section we found that the NextGen isochrones fit the\nIK CMDs very well for I \u2212 K \u223c 1\u20133.5, except for Pleiades sources\nfrom K =10.5\u201313, which are slightly redder than the isochrones. We\nalso found that Dusty isochrones fit the Pleiades IK CMD well for\nI \u2212 K = 4.3\u20136. In this section we test the J \u2212 K model predictions\nfor these ranges, for a sample of field stars with kinematics and well\nmeasured I \u2212 K and J \u2212 K colours.\nFig. 5 shows J \u2212 K plotted against I \u2212 K for sources taken\nfrom Leggett (1992), Leggett, Allard & Hauschildt (1998) and Dahn\net al. (2002). All sources classified as young or old disc (from their\nkinematics) in the Leggett papers are shown as filled or open circles,\nrespectively. In addition, we have assigned four L dwarfs as being\nyoung (<0.5 Gyr), based on lithium detections (Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. 1999).\nThese are also shown as filled circles. The uncertainties are generally\n\u00b10.05 in colour. We have also overplotted the NextGen and Dusty\nmodel isochrones for 120 Myr (dashed lines) and 1 Gyr (dotted\nlines).\nComparison of the two populations shows that for bluer sources\n(I \u2212 K < 3.5, J \u2212 K < 1), the old disc stars have a bigger spread in\nJ \u2212 K and on average are slightly bluer in J \u2212 K than their young\ndisc counterparts. The two NextGen isochrones essentially lie on\ntop of each other in this range, and fit the data very well. For redder\nsources (I \u2212 K = 4.3\u20136, J \u2212 K = 1.1\u20132), the Dusty isochrones\nlie on top of each other, and are in excellent agreement with the\nyoung disc data. In between these two ranges the isochrones are all\ntoo blue in J \u2212 K . The NextGen models are too blue because they\ndo not account for dust, and the Dusty models are too blue because\nthey use a less sophisticated treatment of H2O and TiO molecular\nopacities. This is all consistent with the gradual changeover from\nNextGen to Dusty isochrones that was seen in the IK CMDs, and\nsuggests that these models should provide accurate NIR isochrones\nin the blue and red photometric ranges.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\n1246 D.

The K , J \u2212 K CMD of Praesepe. Symbols are the same as in\nFig. 2.\nin units of 0.001 M\u0006. Typical photometric errors for UKIRT pho-\ntometry are indicated.\nWe constructed cluster sequences for the JK CMDs based on\nour analysis in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. We used NextGen isochrones\nfor I \u2212 K < 3.5 (mass > 0.07 and 0.09 M\u0006 for the Pleiades and\nPraesepe, respectively), and Dusty isochrones for J \u2212 K = 1.1\u20132\n(I \u2212 K = 4.3\u20136). In between the NextGen and Dusty isochrones\nwe added two additional sequence points, based on our Pleiades\nsources; one to bridge the M dwarf gap, and the other to represent\nthe turn down point, where the sequences begins to fall on to the\nDusty isochrone (see Section 3.2). An average of the J \u2212 K colours\nof the Pleiades sources above and below the gap shows that there\nis essentially no significant J \u2212 K colour change across the gap\n(\u0005J \u2212 K = 0.01). Averaging of the three single Pleiades sources in\nthe turn down region gave a turn down colour of J \u2212 K = 1.03. The\nflat region seen in the IK CMDs is thus not very apparent in the JK\nCMDs. For Praesepe we assumed that the JK colour and magnitude\nchanges are the same as in the Pleiades (as we did previously for\nthe IK CMDs). The cluster sequences we constructed are shown as\nsolid lines in the JK CMDs, and a dotted line indicates the spread\nwe expect in the sequence from unresolved binarity.\nThe NextGen part of the sequence fits the observations very well\nin both clusters, and there is certainly no evidence for the Pleiades\nsources being redder than the isochrones from K = 10.5\u201313, as was\nseen in the IK CMDs. The J \u2212 K colour is clearly not affected in the\nway that the I \u2212 K colour is. Below the M dwarf gap, it can be seen\nthat there is a spread in the Pleiades sources, where several are signif-\nicantly redder than expected for single objects. A spread is also seen\nfor a small number of Praesepe sources. Such a spread could result\nfrom several possibilities. Transient surface features such as spots\ncould be responsible. The two most obvious red sources (Teide 1\nand Calar 3; BPL 137 and 235) have been tested for variability.\nBailer-Jones & Mundt (2001) found no evidence of I-band variabil-\nity in Teide 1 over a 100-h time-scale, and only marginal evidence\n(just above the noise) for sporadic variability (\u0005I < 0.03) in Calar 3\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\nBrown dwarfs and low-mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe 1247\nover a 29-h time-scale. Our photometry of Teide 1 comprises three\nwell-separated (>a year) J- and H-band measurements, which are\nconsistent to within their errors. For Calar 3 we have one K-band\nmeasurement that is consistent with the measurement presented by\nMart\u0131\u00b4n et al. (2000) and two H-band measurements that agree to\nwithin their errors. We also have three J-band measurements that\nshow marginal evidence (at the 2\u03c3 level) of variability. The level\nof this variation is not in itself sufficient to account for the redness\nof Calar 3. Photometric errors will also cause some spread in the\nsources. However, the general consistency (at the 1\u03c3 level) between\nour multiple measurements makes it unlikely that these alone are re-\nsponsible. The third option, and the one we chose to consider in more\ndetail, is that additional unresolved binaries (not identified in the IK\nCMD) are present. A substantially redder unresolved companion\ncould redden a source sufficiently to account for the spread. These\nbinaries would either be background sources, or cluster binaries that\ncome from the turn down region of the IK CMD, where binarity is\nnot always apparent. We have thus flagged four additional candidate\nunresolved binaries in the Pleiades and two in Praesepe. We refer\nto these as JK binaries, and they are overplotted with an additional\nopen square in the figures. We note that the bluest of the Pleiades\nJK binaries is a known background binary (without lithium; Mart\u0131\u00b4n\net al. 2000), resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (Mart\u0131\u00b4n\net al. 1998). The Pleiades binaries will be discussed in more detail\nin Section 3.7. Of the two Praesepe JK binaries, the bluer one (RIZ\nPr 23) is located just above where we expect the missing M dwarf\ngap to be, and could be a binary from below the gap. The redder one\n(RIZ Pr 23) comes from the turn down region of the IK CMD.\nWe have flagged non-members in the Pleiades and Praesepe using\nour cluster sequences as a guide. Objects that look too blue are\npresumably background stars from an old-disc population (see Sec-\ntion 3.3), and we flagged them as such if their J \u2212 K colours were\nat least 2\u03c3 blueward of the cluster sequence.\n3.5 The J \u2212 H , H \u2212 K two-colour diagrams\nFigs 8 and 9 show the J \u2212 H , H \u2212 K two-colour diagrams (JHK\ndiagrams) for the Pleiades and Praesepe, respectively. Only good\ncandidates from the IK CMDs are shown. The source symbols mean\nthe same as in Fig. 2. The positions of four field L dwarfs (from Dahn\net al. 2002) are also shown as asterisks. The photometric error bars\nshown in the lower right-hand side of the plots are typical of the\nphotometry of the BPL sources. The fainter sources have slightly\nlarger errors. Solar metallicity model atmosphere predictions (used\nfor the NextGen and Dusty models) are overplotted as dashed and\nsolid lines, respectively, with labels indicating surface gravities. For\nthe Pleiades we plot NextGen models for T eff > 2000 and 3000 K\nand Dusty models for T eff < 2000 K. For Praesepe, we plot NextGen\nmodels for T eff > 2500 and 3000 K, and Dusty models for T eff <\n2500 K.\nFor the highest-mass stars, it can be seen that the NextGen models\nare \u223c0.1 too blue in H \u2212 K up to the two-colour turn-over, where\nconvection begins (\u223c4000 K). The data turns over at H \u2212 K =\n0.27, J \u2212 H = 0.57 and log g for such objects should be \u223c4.5. The\ntheoretical J \u2212 H colour of the turn over is therefore \u223c0.1 too red.\nThese discrepancies are thought to be caused by inaccuracies in the\nmodelling of water vapour opacities in the H band (with its overall\nlow opacity) as well as an underestimation of the mixing length\nparameter. After the turn over, the 2MASS photometry follows a\nshort path in the JHK diagram, reaching J \u2212 H = 0.52, H \u2212 K\n= 0.38 by \u223c3200 K, in reasonable agreement with the log g = 5\nNextGen model. In order to look for any non-evolutionary differ-\nFigure 8. The J \u2212 H , H \u2212 K 2\u2013colour diagram of the Pleiades. Symbols\nare the same as in Fig. 2.

These two sets of sources should be\nfully contracted (according to the models), and should represent the\nT eff \u223c 3500\u20133600 K range (since we have corrected for distance).\nWe see no significant difference in the colours, with J \u2212 H =\n0.53 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.54 \u00b1 0.03, and H \u2212 K = 0.35 \u00b1 0.03 and\n0.33 \u00b1 0.04 for the Pleiades and Praesepe, respectively. Praesepe is\nknown to be slightly metal-rich compared with the Pleiades, with\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\n1248 D. J. Pinfield et al.\n[Fe\/H] = 0.04 \u00b1 0.04\u20130.14 (Friel & Boesgaard 1992; Reglero &\nFabregat 1991). However, this does not appear to significantly affect\nthe stellar NIR colours, consistent with the model predictions in this\nT eff range.\nIn order to show what is happening at cooler T eff values, we\ngrouped the sources into a number of K-magnitude bins. Above the\ngap we selected Pleiades bins of K = 13.6\u201314.1 and 14.1\u201314.65,\nand Praesepe bins of K = 14.5\u201315.3 and 15.3\u201315.85. We labelled\nthese bins A and B, respectively, and they should correspond to ap-\nproximately the same T eff ranges in each cluster (\u223c3150\u20133000 K\nfor A and 3000\u20132800 K for B). Below the gap, we considered\nthree additional Pleiades bins. The K = 14.9\u201315.13 range (bin\nC) contains objects on the flat section of the IK CMD (see Sec-\ntion 3.2). The K = 15.13\u201315.5 range (bin D) contains objects at\nthe top of the turn down, where the sequence begins to drop to-\nwards the Dusty isochrone in the IK CMD. Finally, the K = 15.5\u2013\n16.1 range (bin E) contains objects from near the base of the turn\ndown region, where the IK sequence is joining on to the Dusty\nisochrone. These bins are indicated on the IK and JK CMDs with\ndotted lines, and in the JHK diagrams by boxes drawn with dotted\nlines. In the Pleiades, bin A contains 2MASS sources, and we defined\nthe box dimensions using the standard deviation of the average bin\ncolours. For the remaining bins we defined the box dimensions by\nattempting to include all non-binary member sources within the box\ndimensions.\nWhen we compare the colour\u2013colour location of bins A and B in\neach of the clusters, it can be seen that they differ. In the Pleiades,\nbins A and B have similar colours, and lie very close to the NextGen\nmodel predictions for their T eff range. However, in Praesepe these\nbins have J \u2212 H colours that are \u223c0.1 bluer than this, and bin B\nhas an H \u2212 K colour \u223c0.1 redder. The surface gravities expected\nfor these bins are log g = 5 for the Pleiades and log g = 5.15\u2013\n5.25 for Praesepe, and these differing surface gravities may provide\nthe explanation for the differing colours. We do not expect any\natmospheric dust formation for objects in these bins since their T eff\nvalues are too high (see Tsuji 2002, fig. 7, and Jones & Tsuji 1997),\nso gravity-sensitive dust formation cannot provide the explanation.\nHowever, molecular opacities (such as H2O) could be more sensitive\nto gravity (or pressure) than the NextGen models predict and future\ngenerations of models with updated EOS and opacity data may\naccount for these colour changes.\nMoving to fainter cooler objects in Praesepe, it can be seen that\nthe faint binary candidate below bin B lies on the dusty isochrone,\nconsistent with dust formation beginning in Praesepe at around\nT eff \u223c 2500 K. However, in the Pleiades we are faced with a rather\ndifferent story. Moving across the gap from bin B to C produces no\nsignificant change in colour, and between bins C and D there is then\nan increase of \u223c0.1 in J \u2212 H . These changes are all consistent with\nthe NextGen isochrone. Pleiades sources eventually move on to the\ndusty isochrone between bins D and E, and the two faintest Pleiades\nsources (Roque 25 and 30) both lie on the Dusty isochrones. A pos-\nsible explanation for these near-infrared colours is that dust does not\nbegin to form in Pleiades sources until T eff \u223c 2000 K (between bins\nD and E). This might occur because in lower-gravity atmospheres\nthe lower pressures could suppress dust formation until lower T effs.\nHowever, one would also expect that lower gravity atmospheres\nwould be more extended, and have lower outer temperatures, which\nwould have the opposite effect.\nAssuming that the differences in colour between Pleiades and\nPraesepe sources result from differing surface gravities, then one\nmight expect even greater differences for sources found in star-\nforming regions. This would have implications for the derreddening\nprocess that is commonly used for such sources (e.g. Lucas & Roche\n2000).\nWe have flagged likely non-members using the location of bins\nA to E and the Dusty model atmosphere predictions (for the faintest\nsources) as a guide. Old disc sources appeared too blue in J \u2212 H , and\nseveral non-stellar sources were also identified amongst our data by\ntheir extremely red colours. One object in Fig. 7 (Roque 33) appears\nto be too blue in J \u2212 H . This object is a proper motion member,\nhowever (see Table A1), and we note that its photometric errors\nare \u223c0.2 in colour, making them not inconsistent with membership.\nWe also used the Pleiades JHK diagram to identify some additional\nunresolved binaries. In the turn down region of both the IK and the\nJK CMDs (where the sequence is dropping steeply down towards the\nDusty isochrones), there remains some degeneracy between mass\nand binarity. However, we were able to break this degeneracy using\nour JHK diagram. A single source with K = 15.13\u201315.5 should lie\nin bin D. However, three sources in this magnitude range lie in (or\nvery near to) bin E. These are presumably near equal-mass binaries,\nwhere both components of each binary come from bin E (we refer\nto them as JHK binaries). These binaries are overplotted with an\nadditional open triangle in the figures.\n3.6 Summary of membership criteria\nUsing the IK and JK CMDs, as well as the JHK diagrams, we\nhave assigned photometric membership criteria to our Pleiades and\nPraesepe samples (see the Appendices). In the Pleiades, we flagged\nfive of the 30 BPL BD candidates as non-members. The remain-\ning 25 BPL candidates, and the nine additional Pleiades candidates\nfrom the literature look like cluster BDs. Examination of Table A1\nshows that our criteria for these sources are consistent with exist-\ning spectroscopic and astrometric measurements, where they exist.\nIt is particularly encouraging that we were able to flag CFHT-PL-\n18 (BPL 283) as a background binary from its photometry alone.\nThis source was a suspected BD binary, and was only confirmed\nas a background source when Mart\u0131\u00b4n et al. (2000) failed to detect\nlithium in its spectrum. BPL 45 has been flagged as the same type\nof object based on its measured J- and K-band photometry alone.\nOf the Pleiades low-mass star candidates, we flag 14 non-members\nout of the 194 candidates. This represents only 7 per cent spurious\nsources in the sample. In Praesepe, we identify higher levels of con-\ntamination for our faintest sources. We flag 20 non-members out of\nthe 26 RIZ-Pr candidates, and 37 non-members out of the 89 IZ-Pr\ncandidates. However, for the brighter HSHJ sources we only flag\n21 non-members out of 458. The position of Roque-Pr 1 in the IK\nand JK CMDs is consistent with membership. However, if it is a\nmember, it must be an unresolved BD binary.\n3.7 BD binary mass ratios\nFig. 10 shows two regions of the Pleiades IK and JK CMDs, focus-\ning on the candidate BDs. The symbols mean the same as in Fig.\n2. NextGen and Dusty isochrones are shown with dashed lines, and\nour cluster sequences (see Sections 3.2 and 3.4) are shown as solid\nlines. We also show the effects of unresolved binarity, with the use\nof binary tracks (shown as dotted lines). To construct these binary\ntracks we started with the single star point which is to form the pri-\nmary. Then, by combining the magnitude of this primary with that of\nthe faintest point on the sequence (lowest mass), we obtained a new\nbinary point which we joined to our primary point by a dotted line.\nWe then repeated this process for higher mass secondaries, joining\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\nBrown dwarfs and low-mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe 1249\nFigure 10. K , I \u2212 K and K , J \u2212 K CMDs of Pleiades BDs.\neach new point to its predecessor until we reach an equal-mass bi-\nnary, 0.75 mag above the original primary. We also show five mass\npoints on the CMDs (in units of 0.001 M\u0006). The 0.07-M\u0006 point\njust above the M dwarf gap is the NextGen model prediction for a\n125-Myr isochrone. Since we believe that the M dwarf gap results\nfrom a sharp drop in the luminosity\u2013mass relation, we assumed that\nthe mass just below the M dwarf gap is very similar to the mass just\nabove it. Hence, we have a 0.07-M\u0006 point just below the M dwarf\ngap also. The 0.06-M\u0006 mass point was estimated from the Pleiades\nmass\u2013I relation of Dobbie et al. (2002c), which accounts for the M\ndwarf gap, and was derived using the Pleiades I-band BD LF, and an\nassumed power-law MF. We note that this agrees with the NextGen\nand Dusty model J-band predictions, if they are offset by the\nJ magnitude width of the M dwarf gap. The final two mass points\nare Dusty model predictions for a 125-Myr isochrone. The 0.04-M\u0006\nmass point should be reasonably representative of the point where\nthe sequence joins the Dusty isochrone. We also note that Dob-\nbie et al. (2002c) suggest that model predictions for the masses of\nPleiades BDs from I = 18.5\u201319.5 are too low (by up to 0.01 M\u0006),\nwhich may have some bearing on the Dusty mass estimates.\nWhen analysing these CMDs, we must consider the depth effect\nof the cluster. Sources near the front and back of the cluster will\nappear slightly brighter and fainter, respectively, than they would in\nthe cluster centre. The tidal radius of the Pleiades is 13.1 pc (Pinfield\net al. 1998) giving a full depth of \u00b10.2 mag. However, the majority\nof sources will be found closer to the cluster centre. Jameson et al.\n(2002) fit a King profile (King 1962) to the spatial distribution of\nPleiades BDs, and derived a core radius of 5 pc. We would expect\n\u223c80 per cent of members to lie within this core radius, giving a\nmore likely depth of \u00b10.1 mag. In order to estimate binary mass\nratios (q) for our unresolved binary candidates, we compared their\npositions with the binary tracks in both CMDs, and estimated q\nranges consistent with the photometric errors and the depth effect\nof the Pleiades. We did this for a depth effect of \u00b10.1 and \u00b10.2. We\nalso estimated q ranges on the basis that the Dusty isochrone masses\nmay be higher by 0.01 M\u0006. And finally, we made a small allowance\nfor the known (or suspected) variables (PPL1 and Calar 3). Our\nresults are summarized in Table 2. Column 3 indicates whether the\nsource is an IK, a JK or a JHK binary (identified from the IK CMD,\nthe JK CMD of the JHK diagram). Column 4 gives the estimated\nq range from the mass points in Fig. 9 and a \u00b10.1 depth effect.\nColumn 5 gives a larger q range, estimated with the full \u00b10.2 depth\neffect, and accounting for the uncertainty in the Dusty isochrone\nmass points (assuming they may be 0.01 M\u0006 too low).\nWhere a source appeared in both CMDs, we found q ranges that\nwere consistent (to within photometric errors) for all but two can-\ndidates; CFHT-PL-18 (BPL 283) and BPL 45 appear red in the JK\nCMD, but do not appear sufficiently red in the IK CMD. The compo-\nnent sources of these binaries would therefore be too blue in I \u2212 K\nto be cluster members. This is confirmed for CFHT-PL-18, which is\na known background binary (see Section 3.4). We have also flagged\nBPL 45 as a probable non-member, based on its measured photom-\netry alone. CFHT-PL-12 (BPL 294) and INT-PL-IZ-42 could have\nprimaries that are either just above or just below the M dwarf gap.\nHowever, CFHT-PL-12 would need to be near the front of the cluster\nif its primary was from below the gap. Roque 4 lies quite high in the\nJK CMD, suggesting that it may be a foreground object. However,\nit could still be a binary BD if it is at the front of the cluster, and\nmay alternatively be a BD triple system. We were unable to estimate\ngood q for the two faintest binaries, since we do not know the form\nof the cluster sequence for masses below 0.03 M\u0006.\nIt is clear that the majority of the unresolved binary candidates\nhave fairly high q values. Indeed, 15 of the 18 probable binary BDs\nappear to have q > 0.7. However, the photometry of three sources\nis inconsistent with them being either single or q > 0.7 binaries.\nOne of these is without J- or H-band measurements, and has not\nbeen confirmed as a cluster member (by either a proper motion mea-\nsurement or the lithium test). The other two are Teide 1 and Calar 3,\nwhich are bona fide cluster BDs. We have previously discussed (Sec-\ntion 3.4) other possible causes for the red J \u2212 K colours seen in\nthese sources, and concluded that binarity was the most likely cause.\nWe note in addition that the position of these sources in the JHK\ndiagram is also consistent with binarity, since they appear partway\nbetween bins D\/E and the location of Roque 25. These few objects\ntherefore suggest that BD binaries are not all high-q systems. They\ncould consist of two populations; the majority in high-q systems,\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\n1250 D. J. Pinfield et al.\nTable 2. Pleiades BD binary mass ratios (q).

Theoretical simulations are\nnot yet at a level to make such predictions. However, the hydrody-\nnamical simulation of Bate, Bonnell & Bromm (2002) shows BDs\nforming from the collapse and fragmentation of a turbulent molec-\nular cloud. They determined that \u223c75 per cent of BDs form by the\nfragmentation of gravitationally unstable circumstellar discs, with\nsubsequent ejection removing the BD from the region of dense gas.\nThe remaining 25 per cent were found to form from the fragmenta-\ntion of dynamically collapsing filamentary gas, where the forming\nBDs fell into, and were rapidly ejected from unstable multiple sys-\ntems (see also Reipurth & Clarke 2001). However, this simulation\nonly produced one BD binary, but lacked the spatial resolution to\npredict very close systems. Future simulations with higher spatial\nresolution may reveal a link between the two different formation\nmechanisms and the resulting q distribution of BD binaries.\n3.8 Binary fractions\nWe determined binary fractions (BF; defined as the number of bi-\nnary systems in some photometric range divided by the total number\nof systems in that range) using the IK CMDs in general, for a num-\nber of photometric ranges. The results are given in Table 3, where\nthe uncertainties are determined assuming binomial statistics (see\nBurgasser et al. 2003). The mass ranges were estimated using our\nIK cluster sequences (see Section 3.2). The stellar q ranges were\nestimated by simulating the effect of unresolved binarity in the IK\nCMDs (as was done in Section 3.7 for the Pleiades BDs), and find-\ning the q value when the binary track crosses midway between the\nsingle star sequence and the binary sequence 0.75 mag above it.\nStarting in Praesepe, the first range we considered was from I \u2212\nK = 1\u20131.9 (G and K stars). The single stars all bunch around the\npredicted sequence, and we flagged binaries by their proximity to\nthe binary star sequence. The next range we chose was from I \u2212\nK = 1.9\u20132.5 (where the upper limit represents the completeness of\n2MASS and the HSHJ survey). The sources lie in a fairly straight\nTable 3.

We defined this separa-\ntion line such that the average spread of members above and below\nit was the same (as one would expect for a binary-induced spread).\nAnd by doing this for two subranges (I \u2212 K = 1.9\u20132.2 and 2.2\u2013\n2.5) we ensured that the gradient of the line was correct. We would\nexpect a spread of \u00b10.375 to represent the full spread induced from\nbinarity, and we obtained spreads of \u00b10.36 and \u00b10.43 for the two\nranges, respectively. The slightly larger value for the redder range\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\nBrown dwarfs and low-mass stars in the Pleiades and Praesepe 1251\nis accounted for by larger photometric errors. This approach has the\nadded benefit that it is independent of any assumed distance modu-\nlus. Table 3 gives the binary fraction for both subranges, as well as\nfor the full range. For the lowest-mass Praesepe stars we chose to\nuse I \u2212 K = 3\u20133.6 (where we just have UKIRT photometry). This\navoids the CMD overlap region between the photographic and CCD\nsurveys, where different survey areas and photometric errors com-\nplicate matters. Binaries in this range were flagged in Section 3.2.\nUnlike the higher-mass ranges, these candidates do not have proper\nmotions. However, using the disc luminosity function of Kirkpatrick\net al. (1994), we expect no more than \u223c1 and \u223c0.5 field star to con-\ntaminate the single and binary star sequences, respectively. Such\nnumbers will not significantly affect our statistics.\nFor the Pleiades, the first range we considered was from I \u2212 K =\n2.6\u20133. We took the same approach as for Praesepe, and divided this\nrange in two (I \u2212 K = 2.6\u20132.8 and 2.8\u20133), defining a selection\nline such that the scatter above and below (in each region) was\nidentical. The spread about the selection line was \u00b10.57 for each of\nthe subregions. This is somewhat more than the expected \u00b10.375,\nbut the additional spread will be predominantly due to photometric\nerrors and cluster depth. Finally, we considered a BD range. We\ncounted single BDs below the M dwarf gap that have K < 15.5,\nsince our sample is spatially complete in this range. The mass range\nfor the single stars is \u223c0.07\u20130.05 M\u0006, where we have interpolated\nbetween the 0.06 and the 0.04 M\u0006 points in Fig. 9. We then counted\nbinary BDs that could have primaries amongst these single sources,\nincluding objects from K = 14.2\u201315.2. We note that we ignored\nCFHT-PL-12 (BPL 294) since it is likely that its primary comes\nfrom above the gap. In this way, we selected 10 single BDs and 10\nbinary BDs. We estimated the q sensitivity range for our BD binaries\nusing Table 2.\nWe have already discussed how the cluster depth affects BD bi-\nnaries. However, it will also be a source of error for our stellar BFs.\nObjects with a position on the CMD that is within the cluster depth\n(e.g. 0.2 and 0.15 mag for the Pleiades and Praesepe, respectively)\nof the binary selection line could potentially spill over this line if\nthey were near the front or the back of the cluster. This represents\n53 per cent of Pleiades sources and 40 per cent of Praesepe sources.\nHowever, the cluster spatial distributions (Pinfield et al. 1998;\nHolland et al. 2000) indicate that of these stars, we would only\nexpect \u223c5\u201315 and \u223c5\u201310 per cent of Pleiades and Praesepe stars,\nrespectively, to actually spill across the line. Furthermore, an error\nwill only occur if the BF itself is different from 50 per cent (for\nBF = 50 per cent misidentified binaries and single stars will cancel\nout). Combining these together, we would expect no more than \u223c1\nand 2 per cent BF errors in Praesepe and the Pleiades, respectively,\ndue to depth effects.\nAnother source of error comes from variability, resulting from\nchromospheric activity such as spots or flares pushing some sin-\ngle stars intermittently above the binary selection line. Lockwood\net al. (1984) found that \u223c40 per cent of Hyades F G and K dwarfs\nvaried at a level of \u223c1\u20132 per cent. For later types, Stauffer et al.\n(1991) reported H\u03b1 emission in \u223c60 per cent of late K\u2013mid M\nHyades members, as well as in the vast majority of G\u2013mid M\nPleiades members, and Scholz, Eisloffel & Mundt (2000) found\nphotometric variations among young M dwarfs similar to those of\nsolar type stars. Therefore, although many of our members may be\nvariable, we expect this variability to be generally low (a few per\ncent). More violent flares are occasionally seen in late M dwarfs\n(Liebert et al. 1999), but are rare. We estimate that our stellar BF\nvalues should not be increased by more than \u223c5 per cent as a result of\nvariability.\nFigure 11. The binary fractions of the Pleiades (triangles) and Praesepe\n(circles). Four points from the literature are shown as open diamonds. At 0.1\nM\u0006 the BF error bars of two points overlap, so we plot the Praesepe error\nbars as a dotted line for clarity. The q ranges are indicated next to each point,\nas is an A range for each of the Burgasser and Close points.\nThe BF values are plotted in Fig. 11, as a function of mass. Filled\ntriangles and circles represent Pleiades and Praesepe data, respec-\ntively. Additional points from the literature are shown as open dia-\nmonds. The highest-mass point agrees well with the field star results\nof Duquennoy & Mayor (1991), which increases to 70 per cent for\nq = 0.1\u20131. From 0.6\u20130.35 M\u0006 we find a BF of \u223c30 per cent. The\nBF of NGC 2516 agrees with this value for \u223c0.6 M\u0006, but drops to\n\u223c15 per cent for 0.5\u20130.35 M\u0006 (Jeffries, Thurston & Hambly 2001).\nThis difference could be explained by the fact that the NGC 2516\nCMD was only sensitive to q = 0.6\u20131 binaries, whereas our CMD\nis sensitive to q = 0.3\u20131. If the clusters have intrinsically similar\nbinary populations, then this implies that there is a BF of 15 per cent\nfrom q = 0.3\u20130.6 as well as from q = 0.6\u20131, suggesting a flat BF\u2013\nq distribution in this mass range. This represents a departure from\nthe BF\u2013q distribution of solar-type field stars, which rises towards\nlower q. If the BF\u2013q distribution were like that of solar-type stars\nwe would expect a BF of 30 per cent for q = 0.3\u20130.6, and thus 45\nper cent for q = 0.3\u20131. Our result is 1.5\u03c3 lower than this value. A\nflat binary\u2013q distribution would give a total BF of \u223c45 per cent in\nthis mass range. Next, with the exception of the Pleiades point at\n0.13 M\u0006, there is a general trend of increasing BF towards lower\nmass. The q ranges of these points are fairly similar, and so should\nnot significantly bias this trend. Moving into the substellar regime,\nit can be seen that the BD binary fraction is around 50 per cent.\nEven if we are extremely conservative, and only select the most\nobvious BD binaries from the IK CMD (assuming that JK and JHK\nbinaries are, in fact, single), we find a BF of 32+11\u22128 per cent. Fig. 11\nalso shows the T dwarf BF resolved by the HST (Burgasser et al.\n2003), and the late M\/early L dwarf BF resolved by Hokupa\u2019a on\nGemini (Close et al. 2003). Mass range estimates were taken from\nClose et al. (2003), and estimated for the T dwarfs assuming an age\nrange of 1-5Gyrs. Both these BFs (9+15\u22124 and 15 \u00b1 7 per cent, respec-\ntively) are significantly lower than our BF for Pleiades BDs. How-\never, these observations were only sensitive to binaries with sepa-\nrations >1 au. It is possible that the total BF of these populations is\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 342, 1241\u20131259\n1252 D. J. Pinfield et al.\nidentical to that of Pleiades BDs if 70\u201380 per cent of BD binaries\nhave separations <1 au. It may be that many BD binaries are like\nPPL15 (Basri & Mart\u0131\u00b4n 1999) which has a separation of 0.03 au. We\nalso note that the N-body simulations of Kroupa (2001) and Kroupa,\nAarseth & Hurley (2001) suggest that \u223c50 per cent of cluster BD\nbinaries with log P\/d = 1\u20136 (separations of \u223c0.04\u201390 au) would\nbe disrupted during the first few Myr of protocluster dynamical evo-\nlution. This would require an even higher initial BD BF, unless most\nBD binaries are extremely tight. However, the hydrodynamical sim-\nulation of Bate, Bonnell & Bromm (2002) predicts an initial BF of\n\u223c5 per cent, since only 1 BD binary was produced in their simulation\namong 20 single BDs. But the spatial resolution of this simulation\nwas not high enough to model the formation of extremely close BD\nbinaries. Such binaries may form during a secondary collapse phase\nof individual pressure supported fragments (Bonnell & Bate 1994).\nIf this is not the case (Bate 1998), then post-fragmentation processes\n(such as dynamical interactions) might be responsible for creating\nextremely tight BD binaries (by hardening).\n4 F U T U R E WO R K\nProper motion measurements have already been made for 15 of the\nBD candidates discussed here. Work is currently underway by some\nof us to measure proper motions of the remaining Pleiades BDs. It\nwill be particularly useful to confirm all possible low-q BD binaries\nas Pleiades members. Measuring proper motions of the Praesepe\ncandidates is also important, and is in progress (Chappelle, Pinfield\n& Steele 2002). Such measurements will allow us to define the\nPraesepe cluster sequence with more confidence. Also, the faintest\nPraesepe candidates could be BDs, and would be the first identified\nin an intermediate age cluster.\nMeasuring NIR spectra is a natural next step if we are to under-\nstand the nature of the cluster sequences. These spectra could be\ncompared with the predictions of both NextGen and Dusty model\natmospheres, to determine when dust is beginning to form in the\natmospheres of Pleiades and Praesepe sources, and what effects it\nhas in the different surface gravities. Furthermore, the best way to\nimprove on our analysis of binarity is from NIR spectra. We could\ncombine the spectra of likely single sources, and compare the results\nwith spectra of suspected unresolved binaries, to confirm whether\nor not these sources really are binary in nature.\nThe nature of the M dwarf gap could be further investigated by\nmeasuring longer-wavelength photometry (e.g. L band) of sources\non either side of the M dwarf gap, to look for evidence (or lack of\nit) of dust formation.\nDeeper and larger-scale surveys of the clusters will provide much\nlarger samples of members to work with. The 16 deg2 survey recently\nobtained as part of the WFS with the INT and WFC should identify\nseveral hundred Pleiades BDs. Also, the WFC survey of Praesepe\nmade by Chappelle et al. (2002) should identify large numbers of\nvery low-mass stars and possibly BDs. With these larger samples\nwe will be able to more accurately measure the M dwarf gap in both\nclusters, as well as to obtain a better statistical measure of the BD\nbinary fraction and binary-q distribution.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nDJP and PDD acknowledge funding from PPARC.
