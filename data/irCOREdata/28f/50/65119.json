He called me one day and said \u201c Mohammed! there are some polling stations \nwhere the voting percentage is less than 90%. . We ...all  the regional supervisors are \ncompeting ..that we have to reach 96 %... so every one of us wants his province to \nbe over 96%! \u201d I said \u201c How can I do that, the election\u2019s finished?\u201d . . . He told me \nthat the laws are made by the Revolution Command Council,  and they changed the \nlaw.. .3 \nMohammed, in turn, had called in his subordinates, and explained to them that the law had \nbeen changed and they needed to collect more votes. They returned within hours, ballot \nboxes full; when he asked how it was that they had managed to collect votes so quickly from \n                                                          \nProfessor Justin Willis, Department of History, University of Durham.

The project was managed by the Rift valley Institute \nand funded by the Department for International Development, and the principal researchers were the authors \nof this paper and Professor Peter Woodward of the University of Reading.

Conceived as one of the most important \nmilestones of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), these elections were intended to \nhelp  ensure a lasting and peaceful settlement to the conflict in southern Sudan. This aim \ncan be readily located in a pervasive international logic which sees the secret ballot as the \nkey to political transformation, possessed of an almost magical force to end conflict and \ndeliver just government, and it has been suggested that these elections were inserted into \nthe process at the insistence of the international sponsors of the CPA.4 Yet Mohammed\u2019s  \nstory recalls a recent history of state-ordered malpractice and official connivance, of \nelections which are no more than sham; in this more immediate context, how can elections \nbe a success?  Sudan has had many elections over the last six decades; none has produced a  \ngovernment which has been both widely accepted and stable. This paper explores the \nhistory of elections by secret ballot in Sudan since the 1950s, to  try and identify how these \nhave all \u2013 in different ways \u2013 been problematic, and to consider what this history may reveal \nabout the likely outcomes of the planned election. \nStudying elections \nIn Sudan, as elsewhere in Africa, elections with adult suffrage and a secret ballot were \ninnovations of the last years of colonial rule. The  sudden rise of the secret ballot to \ncentrality in the political system was partly the result of the demands of nationalist \npoliticians \u2013 who saw the secret ballot in itself as a mark of responsible nationhood, and a \nbattering ram against the last redoubts of colonial rule.  But these elections were also the \n                                                          \n4\n For critical comment on this notion, see L. Whitfield and A. R. Mustapha, \u2018Conclusion: the politics of African \nstates in the era of democratisation\u2019, 225-226, in A.R. Mustapha and L. Whitfield (eds), Turning Points in \nAfrican Democracy (Woodbridge and Rochester, NY, James Currey, 2009), 202-227. The role of the \ninternational sponsors in insisting on elections in Sudan is suggested by J. Young, \u2018Sudan IGAD Peace Process: \nan Evaluation\u2019, (unpublished, 2007, available at URL: \nhttp:\/\/www.sudantribune.com\/IMG\/pdf\/Igad_in_Sudan_Peace_Process.pdf), 30-31; but cf Young\u2019s earlier \nsuggestion that international sponsors had little interest in elections and that it was the ruling National \nCongress Party who wanted them: J. Young, \u2018Sudan: a flawed peace process leading to a flawed peace\u2019, 106, \nReview of African Political Economy 103 (2005), 99-113. \n3 \n \nlast and most ambitious disciplinary project of the colonial state, a final exercise in listing, \nqueuing and counting.5 \nThe post-colonial chronology of Sudan\u2019s elections has been a little atypical, in African terms, \nas will be detailed below; but here as elsewhere there have been both multi-party and \nsingle-party elections, bombastic announcements of overwhelming turnouts in single-\ncandidate polls and, sometimes, lively local competition for votes. And in Sudan, as \nelsewhere, the holding of elections by secret ballot has been partly the consequence of \nexternal pressure and of a reflexive mimesis: as the Chair of Sudan\u2019s Election Commission \ntold the public in 1958 \u2018the yes of the world are upon you\u2019.6   \nStudies of elections across the continent have also explored the role of elections in \nconstructing and maintaining networks of clientelism or purging members of the ruling \ngroup who have fallen from favour.7 In arguing a deep history of electoral behaviour in \nAfrica some have implied that all methods of elections are somehow similar, and that the \nsecret ballot is no more than a means to deal with larger numbers.8 But elections by secret \nballot are different.  As Tom Young has noted, the use of the secret ballot has not been \nsolely a result of  direct external pressure, or the pursuit of tactical political ends; it has been \nbundled up with the wider project of modernity and development to which most post-\ncolonial African states have been rhetorically committed - however illusory that project may \nhave proven.9  Studies have repeatedly suggested  the secret ballot has been seen  \u2013 even \nby the most authoritarian regimes \u2013 as a source of legitimacy;10 Young argues that the \nsecret ballot had that potential power because it offers - for some, at least - an imaginary \nideal,  the performative enactment of the relationship between the modern, organizing \n                                                          \n5\n F.

People are \nlisted, marshalled, identified; and then they are presented with a single moment of political \nchoice, in which they are demonstratively separated from kin and neighbours, from sheikh \nand priest, landlord and employer.12 It is an approach which has some resonance \u2013 though \nin very different language - with Staffan Lindberg\u2019s suggestion that the secret ballot helps to \nembed new forms of political practice.13 In Sudan, as elsewhere, elections by secret ballot \nhave been held because at least some Sudanese have seen them as part of this state \nproject, a performance aimed not at an external audience but at the Sudanese populace \nthemselves. \nBut commitment to this ideal varied, and this paper will argue that understanding the \nhistory of the secret ballot in Sudan entails some unpacking of the complex bundle of \ninterests and processes that we call, summarily, \u2018the state\u2019. Elections\u2019, as Mackenzie and \nRobinson understatedly put it, \u2018are administratively complex\u2019. 14 In focussing in particular on \nthe detail of this complexity \u2013 on what actually happened in the registration process, and in \nthe polling booth \u2013 the paper will draw attention to the particular position and interests of \nadministrative officials, as distinct from the politicians whose doings have been the usual \nfocus of electoral studies. In Sudan, the self-conscious awareness of an administrative cadre \nthat they were the embodiment of a modern, national state was immensely important; for \nthem the disciplinary national project of the election was a central part of their duty. Yet \ntheir desire to realize the electoral ideal has always been  thwarted: by the immense \nchallenges of the operation in a country as large as Sudan, and by political conflicts which in \nthemselves were partly the product of this group\u2019s narrow vision of the modernizing \n                                                          \n11\n T.

In a very large country with poor \ncommunications, where much of the population is unused to the routinizing disciplinary \nprocesses of bureaucracy, it is not cheap or easy to perform all the multiple procedures of \nthe secret ballot to a consistent standard. The Sudanese state has always been short of \n                                                          \n15\n For the narrowness of the particular modernizing project of post-colonial Sudan see, most recently, H. \nSharkey, \u2018Arab identity and ideology in Sudan: the politics of language, ethnicity and race\u2019, African Affairs, 107 \n(2008), 21-43; also A.M.

This paper will suggest that elections by secret \nballot can in such circumstances become the exact inverse of their idealization \u2013 serving as \ndemonstrations  of the partial, corrupt and incompetent nature of power, demoralizing and \ndiscrediting officials and providing an opportunity for the assertion of the continued vitality \nof collective ties of religion and ethnicity. \nElectoral studies have noted a tendency for international observers to be inordinately \nimpressed by visible evidence of the performance of some processes of the secret ballot.21 \nThis paper will argue that in the case of  Sudan\u2019s multi-party elections, problems have been \npartly masked by observers who, impressed by the absence of the  flagrant cheating which \ncharacterized Nimeiri\u2019s referenda, were inclined to gloss over problems of procedure. This \nwas true of both diplomats  (who were, for example, cheerfully upbeat about the 1968 \nelection despite the tiny turnout in southern Sudan and the murder of the leader of the \nlargest southern party by the army during the campaign) and of academics, some of whom \ndisplayed a sort of condescending indulgence (praising the \u2018remarkable performance\u2019 of \nelections while noting almost in passing  that problems of transport made it impossible for \nsome officials to keep to timetables for registration and polling  in rural Sudan).22  The \nuncritical attitude of these observers reflected \u2013 and was no doubt partly driven by \u2013 the \nvery strong sense that elections had come to be seen as a display of international \nrespectability; a test which had to be passed for a new nation to be taken seriously.23  \nLearning to vote: the elections of the 1950s \nThe comparatively rapid adoption of the secret ballot in Sudan was driven by the complex \npolitical rivalries  of its colonial rulers, Egypt and Britain. Each sought to win the support of \nthe educated Sudanese  elite with concessions, including the ballot; in consequence, Sudan \n                                                          \n21\n G.

Principal among \nthese was the sense that the secret ballot was a mark of political maturity, and that election \nby secret ballot was an existential test of nationhood; if Sudanese administrators  could run \nsuch an election, and Sudanese people vote in it, then Sudan had proved its readiness for \nindependence. As one politician put it \u2018when the eyes of the whole world are focussed \ntowards our country, it is our duty to prove that we can govern ourselves\u2019.25  The \n\u2018committees\u2019 of administrators and other public servants who ran the election were \nexplicitly driven by this sense of national duty, proudly reporting how \u2018calm\u2019 and \u2018orderly\u2019 \nthe polls were; symptomatically, in some constituencies the end of the ballot saw self-\ncongratulatory celebrations, not for the winning candidates but for electoral officials.26 It \nwas this shared experience of the election which helped give Sudan\u2019s parliament the \nconfidence to declare independence two years later \u2013 even though the majority of its \nmembers had been elected on the basis of a nominal commitment to union with Egypt. \nThe second characteristic was a sense among officials that the overall electoral performance \nwas more important than whether or not particular  people, or groups, could actually \nexercise their right to vote. Exasperated by the constant complaints of British officials that \nrural Sudanese \u2013 and especially southern Sudanese \u2013 might be unable to participate \nproperly in elections by secret ballot, the chair of the international Mixed Electoral \nCommission which was supervising the process wrote that \u2018the Commission recognizes that \nin the conditions prevailing in the south, there is a risk that elections held under any \nprocedure might not be an unqualified success . . . it will not improve matters, however, if \n                                                          \n24\n Justin Willis, \u2018\u201dA model of its kind\u201d: the Sudan self-government election of 1953\u2019, Journal of Imperial and \nCommonwealth History 35 (2007), 485-502. \n25\n Al Rai al \u2018Amm, 24 Nov. 1953; Siddiq al Mahdi to Sukumar Sen, Electoral Commission, 5 Oct. 1953, National \nRecord Office, Khartoum (NRO), Elecom (1) 10\/2\/4.

For the same reason, the Commission turned a blind eye to the many \ncomplaints received from all sides about electoral malpractice \u2013 notably the use of bribes \nand official intimidation -  because they feared  that rigorous investigation or punishment \nmight  lead one party or another to denounce the whole process.28 Just making sure that \nthe election happened became the most important goal of the Commission.29 \nThis willingness to accept the exclusion of large numbers of potential voters was the \ncorollary of a kind of political elitism which was built into the 1953 elections, and was itself \nreflective of the \u2018bifurcation\u2019 of the colonial state.30 Ninety-two seats in parliament were \nelected by \u2018territorial constituencies\u2019, with adult male suffrage; these had an average \npopulation of around 100,000 each. There were an additional five seats for the \u2018graduates\u2019 \nconstituency\u2019, which offered additional representation to those who had completed \nsecondary education; in total, just over 2,400 graduates registered to vote in this \nconstituency. This additional representation drew on imperial precedent \u2013 university seats \nin the UK had only recently been abolished \u2013 but it also reflected the acute sense among \neducated Sudanese that they were a small minority, with special rights and duties: \n\u2018Educated people are guided more by their ideas than the various sects . . . *the graduate \nvote] sets up a genuinely intellectual support \u2013 and the most honourable of all \u2013 for the \ncoming Parliament\u2019.31 The fear among the educated  that the universal franchise might hand \npower to sectarian or tribal leaders who could command the votes of large numbers of \nuneducated followers, was to be a constant factor in the politics of  independent Sudan; and \n                                                          \n27\n Sukumar Sen to Beaton, 18 Oct. 1953, NRO Elecom (1) 10\/2\/4. \n28\n Willis, \u2018\u201dA model of its kind\u201d\u2019.

The Chairman of the Election Commission which supervised the process was the \nsenior civil servant who had been secretary to the Mixed International Commission of 1953; \nhe wrote to his subordinates that  \nI on behalf of all the Commission wish you and all your officials the best in the great \ntask that lies ahead . . . we are all confident that we shall in future look back with \npride to the great achievements and service you have all rendered this country.34 \nHis Commission bombarded its staff with telegrams and  directives which exhorted them to \nregister as many voters as possible and  set out how every step of the election should be \nhandled (with detailed lists of required items for polling stations) and told them that \u2018You \nmust satisfy yourselves that the voters are keeping order and are forming themselves into a \nsmart queue\u2019.35 There is no doubt that the Election Commission took its job seriously; so \nmuch is clear from the barely-suppressed outrage in its final report over the gerrymandered \nconstituency boundaries which were imposed on it by the government.36 But its directives \nwere simply impossible to follow and so, ironically, had the effect of encouraging deviation \nfrom process.37  \n                                                          \n32\n El-Battahani, \u2018Multi-party elections\u2019, 263. \n33\n It is difficult to give a national turnout figure because of the use of indirect voting in some seats; but in \nKhartoum, for example, less than 50% of those registered actually turned out to vote in 1953: figures from \nSudan Government, Final Report of the 1953 Electoral Commission (Khartoum: Sudan Government, 1954), \nappendices. \n34\n Hassan Ali Abdallah to all Chief Election Officers, 24 Feb. 1958, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/3\/20. \n35\n Secretary, Election Commission to all Chief Election Officers, 1 Nov. 1957, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/3\/18; Directive \nNo. 13, 6 Jan. 1958, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/4\/26 \n36\n Government of Sudan, Election Commission\u2019s Final Report (Khartoum: Republic of Sudan, 1958), 9-10; also \nBechtold, Politics in the Sudan, 195 and A.

Although \nthe Election Commission was able to call on the labour of several thousand local \ngovernment officers and teachers, there were not enough educated staff to cover the whole \nof this vast country. Registering and polling teams had to move around, collecting names \nand votes over an extended period - but there was not enough transport.38 Returning \nofficers were told that they must hold \u2018rehearsals\u2019: \nEnsure that candidates, their agents or polling agents also attend rehearsals. Exhibit widely \nElection Films at these rehearsals. Rehearsals will be of no use unless they are held two or \nthree times weekly. All Presiding and Polling Officers must compulsorily attend these \nrehearsals.39 \n Three weeks before the elections, they were told that rehearsals should henceforth be \ndaily.40 But in rural constituencies scattered staff could not be brought together in advance \n\u2013 because they had other jobs, and there was no transport; and anyway there were few \ncopies of the films, and even fewer mobile cinemas.41 The film shows were a kind of double \nadministrative fantasy: an acted display of order, which officials were directed to show even \nthough it was impossible for them to do so. In a more plaintive moment, the Chair of the \nElection Commission wrote that \u2018It is sincerely hoped that the whole election will work as \nnicely as it was planned on paper.\u201942 \nIt did not, and the disparity in electoral experience already suggested by the 1953 statistics \nbecame more acute as a result. Where the state was at its strongest, in the riverain north \u2013 \nwhere there were trained staff, and vehicles, and where education levels among the \npopulation were also higher \u2013 both registration and turnout were good, encouraging a  \nprofound self-congratulation among  officials: \u2018we must thank the Election Commission for \nthe honour it bestowed on us by enabling us to perform a notable piece of work for our \n                                                          \n38\n Chief Election Officer, Malakal to Election Commission, 2 Nov. 1957; Chief Election Officer, Malakal to \nElection Commission, 14 Nov. 1957; Election Commission to all Chief Election officers, 1 Dec. 1957; Chief \nElection Officer Kordofan to Election Commission, 16 Dec. 1957; all in NRO Elecom (2) 1\/3\/18 \n39\n Electoral Commission, Directive No. 12, 6 January 1958, NRO ELECOM (2) 1\/4\/26 \n40\n Directive No. 12, 6 Jan. 1958, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/4\/26; Election Commission to all Chief Election Officers, 29 \nJan. 1958, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/3\/20. \n41\n \u2018Final report on elections, Northern province\u2019, nd NRO Elecom (2) 1\/1\/10. \n42\n Election Commission to all Chief Election officers, 15 Feb. 1958, NRO Elecom (2) 1\/3\/26. \n11 \n \ncountry\u2019.43 But elsewhere, registration and turnout were much lower, and reports suggested \nthat the electoral process, desperately short of resources, ground to a halt in the face of \npopular suspicion.44 The electoral experience of potential voters in Upper Nile, where only \none in fifty of the populace voted, was very different to that of those in greater Khartoum, \nwhere around one in ten people cast their ballot.45 In some ways this is rather like the \u2018legal \ndisfranchisement\u2019, described by Frederic Schaffer \u2013 but in this case propelled not by \n\u2018cleaning\u2019 up the election, but by  a  willingness to accept failures in the procedures required \nfor such an election.46 \nThe elections of the 1960s \nWithin months of the 1958 election, the military took power \u2013 encouraged to do so by a \nprime minister who feared to lose a parliamentary vote. The failure of the electoral process \nto win widespread support was perhaps evident enough in the way that the coup passed \n\u2018without a murmur of public protest\u2019.47 The next six years saw a steady slide into outright \ncivil war in the south, accelerated by the increasingly authoritarian and narrow vision of \nprogress pursued by the military government.48 When popular unrest brought down the \nmilitary government in the \u2018October revolution\u2019 of 1964, multi-party elections for a \n\u2018Constituent Assembly\u2019, which would provide the basis of government and would be \nresponsible for approving a new constitution, soon followed. The overthrow of the military \nregime was really a movement of educated, urban northern Sudanese, a political moment in \nKhartoum, led by students and intellectuals rather than a popular revolution across the \ncountry. Elections were for this group \u2013 intimately linked as they were with Sudan\u2019s \nadministrators and politicians -  a reaffirmation of Sudan\u2019s status as a modern nation, a \ndemonstration of the viability of the Sudanese state.

Despite the upbeat reports of some observers, there were \nalso problems in the process in parts of northern Sudan. In \u2018nomad and semi-nomad\u2019 areas \nvoter registration was based on lists supplied by the traditional leaders on whom local \nadministration relied. Elsewhere, registration was supposed to be direct; in fact, many \nregistration officials, who were under constant pressure to ensure a high level of \nregistration, simply accepted lists of names supplied by parties (which, given the poor state \nof national organization of most parties, really meant the agents of local candidates).52  \nNo voters\u2019 cards were issued; lists of names were typed up into alphabetical electoral \nregisters. The names on these were numbered sequentially in the order that they were \nadded to the register, but voters could find this out only by consulting the typed final \nregister. While this was supposed to be displayed for public inspection, this was often done \nlate, if at all, so that very few voters would have actually been able to look for their names \nor numbers before polling day.53 Even in Khartoum, the official report on the elections \nnoted that \u2018There was inadequate time for registration , which caused many mistakes which \ncould have been avoided\u2019.54 Bechtold\u2019s rather carefully worded description suggests \n                                                          \n49\n Al Ayyam, 19 Jan. and 4 Apr. 1965. \n50\n Abushoul, Al Intikhabat, 130. For some flavour of the debates over this, see the reports in Al Ayyam, 6 and 8 \nJan. 1965. \n51\n Bechtold suggested that there were few complaints over boundaries in the 1965\/7 election and that which \nfollowed in 1968 (Politics in the Sudan, 167); but Abushouk details a number of irregularities (Al Intikhabat, \n150) and the chair of the 1968 Election Commission recalled direct gerrymandering: Interview, El Tayyib El \nKhalil, Khartoum, 2 Mar. 2009; also Adlan Hardallo,  Khartoum,19 Jan. 2009; Siddig Yousif, Khartoum, 17 Jan. \n2009. \n52\n For the formal insistence on direct registration see Interview: El Tayyib El Khalil, Khartoum, 2 Mar. 2009; for \nacceptance of party lists, see Interview Abdel Rahman Gaili, Khartoum North, 25 Feb. 2009; Ibrahim Moniem \nMansour, Khartoum, 24 Feb. 2009. \n53\n For complaints regarding registers, see NUP Omdurman to Senior Election Officer, Khartoum, 25 Mar. 1965; \nAbbas Dafalla, Umma Party to Senior Election Officer, 22 Apr. 1965, NRO Elecom (3) 1\/2\/8.  \n54\n \u2018Final report on geographical constituencies, Khartoum\u2019, 1965, NRO Elecom (3) 1\/2\/9. \n13 \n \nsomething of the consequent problems with registers which were, for the voters and for \nofficials,  the only proof of eligibility to vote: \nAn additional difficulty lay in the state most registration lists were in, particularly in \nview of the problem of arranging the names correctly in alphabetical order. It can be \nestimated that roughly three-fourths or more of all Sudanese names begins with one \nof three letters \nBechtold slipped into a footnote the further observation that \u2018most literate Sudanese were \nnot at all sure of the correct sequence of letters in the Arabic alphabet\u2019 .55 \nIn response to these problems, the agents of candidates went beyond the provision of \nnames for registration, and in some cases they helped voters find their names (or names like \ntheirs) on the lists; they would then write the sequential number on a piece of paper which \nthe voter could then use to try and persuade the polling station staff of his or her right to \nvote.56  Where there was no such assistance, voters just had to hope that harassed polling \nstaff would find their names, possibly over the objections of rival agents who might \nchallenge their right to vote.57 Would-be voters who had some education and a degree of \ncultural confidence in dealing with officials, and had some familiarity in bureaucratic \nprocedures, would have been most likely to succeed in casting a vote.  In rural areas, where \nit was unlikely that candidates would be able to arrange this kind of assistance to voters, \npeople were very much reliant on their relationship with local men of influence, who served \nas \u2018identifiers\u2019 at each polling station, and whose role was to confirm \u2013 or challenge \u2013 the \nidentity of those who sought to vote. \nTaking lists of voters from candidates\u2019 agents, and turning a blind eye to the presence of \nagents around the polling station, were unacknowledged ways of \u2018changing the law\u2019. So too \nwas the acceptance of a developing culture of feeding, entertaining and transporting \npossible voters. In 1953, transporting voters had \u2013 after some uncertainty - been forbidden, \nand while there had been a good deal of gift-giving in an attempt to influence both voters \n                                                          \n55\n Bechtold, Politics in the Sudan, 149. \n56\n Interview: Siddig Yousif, Khartoum, 17 Jan. 2009; also Maaz al Hassan, Wad Medani, 9 Jan. 2009. \n57\n Interviews: Abdel Rahman Gaili, Khartoum North, 25 Feb. 2009;  \n14 \n \nand candidates, this had been limited to some extent by the possibility of legal action.58  But \nby the 1960s, both the provision of transport to bring voters to the polling station, and the \nfeeding of voters while they were waiting to vote, had become widespread.59 Given the \ndistance that some rural voters had to travel to reach polling stations, and the possibility \nthat once there they would be required to queue for hours as officials struggled with the \nregisters, this kind of provision made it much more likely that voters would turn out; but it \nwas, of course, entirely dependent on the resources and organizing capacity of the \ncandidates in any particular constituency. The consequence was a considerable disparity in \nturnout in different parts of northern Sudan, which was in some areas very low.60 \nIn southern Sudan, by-elections were eventually held in 1967. This was not because levels of \nviolence had diminished -  if anything, they had worsened, though the final report of the \nElection Commission blandly remarked that \u2018voting began calmly in the south\u2019.61 It was more \nsimply that Sadiq al Mahdi, whose Umma party had come out of the 1965 vote with the \nlargest number of seats but no clear control of parliament, thought that he could win seats \nin the south - where the only people likely to register and vote were officials, police and \nsoldiers - cheaply and easily.62    Umma did win more of the southern seats than did any \nother party, in many cases with very small turnouts.63 While the official report of the \nelection glossed over problems,  newspaper accounts from southern Sudan suggest that \npractice was very far indeed from the letter of the law: \nThe opening of the polls has been shrouded with secrecy. Apart from announcements that \nthe polls would open today, no clarification has been made whether or not polling opens in \nall the 34 constituencies all over the south or by stages, province by province, or \n                                                          \n58\n The Khartoum police announced that transporting voters would be treated as an offence in 1953: al Rai al \n\u2018Amm, 24 Nov. 1953 \n59 B.

They were representing national unity and confirming the \ncommitment towards the one country \n\u2018The millions who were practising their right were actually announcing their new belief in the \nunity of leadership against the variety of commitments, the unity of the land against the \ndefeated sectarianism, regionalism and racism.70 \n \n Nimeiri held  three referenda on the position of the president, intended as public \nperformances of allegiance.71  This was the context for the ballot-box stuffing described at \nthe beginning of this paper, and for other farcical performances of the \u2018secret ballot\u2019, such \nas the use of a system of two ballot boxes, one for \u2018yes\u2019 votes and one for \u2018no\u2019 votes, \npositioned so that officials could clearly see which box the voter used.72 \nThe Nimeiri period also saw a series of elections to a parliament, or \u2018Popular Assembly\u2019.73 \nThese gave special political weight to people with certain kinds of education or \nemployment, who would \u2018represent the bodies of the May revolution\u2019 in what were called \n\u2018sectoral\u2019 seats.74 The list of sectoral seats became increasingly elaborate: alongside farmers \nand veterinarians there were seats for book-keepers, university graduates of agricultural \nprofessions and administrators.75 Few people  voted for this \u2018sectoral\u2019 representation, and  \nthose who did were mostly in urban areas. In 1980, one candidate was elected to represent \nthe \u2018economists and financial officers\u2019 with a total of 732 votes nationally; 586 of these were \ncast in Khartoum.76  \nNimeiri\u2019s elections were supervised by \u2018Technical Election Committees\u2019 which sent out \nstreams of directives requiring officials to swear oaths and offering bombastic instructions: \n\u2018take part in many practice polls\u2019,  urged one.77 But electoral procedure became ever more \n                                                          \n70\n Text of Nimeiri\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation Address\u2019, 29 Apr. 1977.

The pressures on the officials \nwere  to provide lengthy lists of names to show how popular elections were, and to make \nsure that on election day many of those names were ticked off on lists.  In some places, \nofficials neatly short-circuited the process, and  there was no registration; people turned up \nto vote and their names were written down as they voted. Elsewhere local officials carefully \nwrote up lists of names of tax-payers by hand in books; then separated these out into \nalphabetical order and used these as registers.78 In the final years of the regime, as \nshortages became ever more common, officials started to use ration lists to compose voting \nregisters.79 In some territorial constituencies \u2013 which were very large \u2013 there were dozens of \ncandidates, all standing with the approval of the SSU. Candidates relied entirely on tribal \nloyalty or personal popularity, and  the elections became an almost parodic performance of \nthe rituals of the secret ballot. Ballot papers with 25 symbols for separate candidates were \nproduced, but even this was not enough in some constituencies, and officials were \ninstructed to fasten two of these papers together, though they were not told how voters \nshould show whether they wanted the candidate represented by the tree on the first paper, \nor the one represented by the tree on the second paper.80   \nNimeiri lost power in 1985, unseated by popular unrest; as in 1964, politicians and \nadministrators then turned to parliamentary elections by secret ballot as an assertion of \nSudan\u2019s continued viability as a state, and in the face of a rapidly escalating renewed war in \nthe south.81 They were encouraged to do so partly by a desire for international \nrespectability, but also because the major sectarian parties of northern Sudan believed that \nan election would allow them to mobilise a rural vote which would strengthen their hand \nagainst some of the more radical elements who had been involved in the uprising.82  There \nwas much debate over the system to be used, which ended with an agreement that there \nwould be 273 members of parliament elected by universal adult suffrage from geographical \nconstituencies and 28 elected by  special graduates\u2019 constituencies, in which the electorate \nwould be composed of people who had two or more years of post-secondary education - \n                                                          \n78\n Some of these books are preserved in the Government of Southern Sudan Archives, in Juba. \n79\n Interview: Mohammed Ahmed Salim, 1 Mar. 2009. \n80\n Directive No. 12, 16 Apr. 1974, NRO Elecom (5) 14\/1\/5. \n81\n Johnson, Root Causes, 59-81. \n82\n Interview: Adlan Hardallo, Khartoum, 19 Jan. 2009. \n19 \n \nwho, in the words of one official, had greater political \u2018comprehension\u2019.83 Once again, a \nthree-man Election Commission was appointed (including one man who had served in the \n1968 Commission) and once again it busied itself with the issuing of directives. \nThe major rebel movement, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement (SPLM), boycotted \nthe general election, arguing that a peace deal which addressed their demands for political \ntransformation must be negotiated first. The interim administration in Khartoum pressed on \nwith the election, determined to have the show of a national poll in defiance of the reality \nof widespread violence in the south, and the collapse of government control over significant \nareas. There was, in the event, no voting at all in thirty-seven of the sixty-eight southern \nconstituencies; as in the 1960s, even in those southern constituencies where there was a \nvote, registration and turn-out were very poor. By contrast, registration and turn-out in \ngreater Khartoum and in Northern Province \u2013 along the line of the Nile \u2013 were very high \nindeed. Even here, and despite the vigorous ideological differences between some of the \ncompeting parties - Communists, Ba\u2019athists and the National Islamic Front (NIF) -\ncampaigning might rely on ties of family or locality, as one successful candidate for the NIF, \nan Islamist party, explained: \nI went to all centres, places you can find people, where you can have access: clubs, football \nclubs, especially, and the social clubs. Otherwise, the mosque. Every week, to visit the \nmosque, to say prayers and to speak after with them, informally.  So I find a lot of blood \nrelationship, area allegiances where I come from in the north, and ideologically people were \nreally unsure. . . .. It is family connections which you can bank on. . . .84 \nHIgh registration and turnout in some areas rested on practises which contravened the \nformal directives of the Commission: accepting lists of voters, ignoring treating, transporting \nand oathing of voters, allowing agents to help prospective voters assert their right to vote at \nthe polling station. Around Khartoum, the growing numbers of \u2018internally displaced people\u2019 \n                                                          \n83 Abushouk, Al-Intikhabat, 199-201; J.

Because normally, the IDPs, some were being \nremoved from place to place, so whoever talks much, or has this Islamic support, will be the \none who will be elected. Because they were making use of the chiefs, the chiefs appointed in \nthe IDP camps. Those people were being controlled by these chiefs. To go and vote, \nmobilising them to go.85 \nSuch practices also facilitated the considerable multiple voting and impersonation which is \nsuggested by some very high \u2013 or simply impossible \u2013 turnout figures.86  Once again, there \nwas gerrymandering of constituencies, and parties jockeyed to take advantage of the \nadditional votes given to the educated. The NIF did this most successfully, ingeniously \nexploiting the regulations on expatriate graduate voters to ensure that it won the great \nmajority of graduates\u2019 seats.87 \n \nIn the parts of northern Sudan beyond the riverain heartland,  turnouts and registration \nwere lower \u2013 though still much better than in the south - and the failures of procedure \nwhich partly lay behind this were heavily criticized by some Sudanese observers at the \ntime.88 Again, registration and turnout in rural Sudan relied on the involvement of \nintermediaries, usually local figures who claimed some kind of authority based on tribe or \nreligion.89 And when the military seized power again, in 1989, once more there was no \npopular movement in defence of the elected government. \n \nElections and National Salvation \n                                                          \n85\n Interview: Juba Local Government Board, 4 Feb. 2009. \n86\n Constituencies with more than 100%  turnout were nos. 44 (Omdurman Wad Nubawi);  46 (Omdurman \nMusalama\/Maurada); 111 (Singa); 141 (South Fasher); 189 (East Kassala).

One interviewee \nexplicitly linked the anomalous voting figures of 1986 with the presence of IDPs: Mahgoub Mohammed Salih, \nKhartoum,  17 Jan. 2009. \n87\n Interview: Mukhtar al Assam, Khartoum, 18 Jan. 2009. \n88\n One prominent critique being Sharif al Hindi. Interview: Shendi Group, 28 Feb. 2009.  \n89\n Interview: Halima Hamid Musa, Omdurman, 1 Mar. 2009. \n21 \n \nThe group of soldiers and Islamist ideologues who seized power in June 1989 offered a new \nrationale for a succession of exercises involving the secret ballot:  presidential and \nparliamentary votes in 1996 and 2000, and a referendum on a new constitution in 1998. \nThese were presented as both a departure from an imposed foreign form of democracy and \nas an intentional break with tradition (taqlid). Instead, they would be a tool for renewal \n(tajdid) - these terms being taken from wider debates over the role of Islam which stressed \nits role as a route to renewal. Elections would, at the same time, be an opportunity for the \npopulace to express their allegiance, ba\u2019ia,  to a leader whose acceptance of that allegiance \nimplied that authority ultimately lay in the hands of God.90 Yet despite the emphasis on \ncollective consensus, the secret ballot played a prominent role in each of these events. It \nwas announced through the press and through speeches at mosques, that voting was a \npublic  and a religious duty; and the organizers of elections took some pride in framing a \nnew electoral law and regulations and in performing some of the rituals of the ballot \u2013 \nchoosing symbols, sealing and unsealing boxes, and so on.91 The international press were \ninvited, and the northern Sudanese press covered the votes at considerable length, \nsolemnly offering figures on turnout and reporting alleged minor problems of procedure.92  \nThe elections were, however, widely criticized. In 1996  the many individuals who stood \nagainst the incumbent , Omer el Beshir, in the presidential race  were unknowns, the press \nwere tightly-controlled, and state resources were freely used in support of the incumbent\u2019s \ncampaign. Registration, it was openly acknowledged, was conducted on the basis of putting \ntogether various existing lists of names.93 There were allegations that ballot boxes were \nstuffed by anxious officials, there were special voters\u2019 lists for members of the uniformed \nforces and it was rumoured that millions of spoiled ballots were destroyed in order not to \n                                                          \n90\n The clearest discussion of these ideas took place in a conference on \u2018The Islamic perspective on elections\u2019, \nreported in Al Sudan al Hadith, 6 Mar. 1996; see especially the section \u2018The democracy of Westminster is not \nappropriate to Sudan\u2019.

This is partly a consequence of the \nnotional commitment to decentralization, espoused by a succession of regimes in \nKhartoum, and which has been the ironic counterpart to persistent state authoritarianism. \nMultiple levels of elected government have been created, and must be voted for: the \nnational president; the president of the autonomous Government of Southern Sudan; the \ngovernor of each of the 26 \u2018devolved\u2019 states  into which Sudan is divided; the national \nparliament; the parliament of each state; and the parliament for southern Sudan. The \nelections for national, southern and state parliaments will be further complicated by the \nvoting system. In each of these bodies, 60% of members will be elected by territorial \nconstituencies, on a first-past-the post basis. There are no \u2018graduates\u2019 seats\u2019, but the notion \nof special representation has emerged in a new form. 25% of seats in each parliament are \nreserved for women members, who will be elected on an adult franchise using a \nproportional representation system at the level of each state. A further 15% are reserved for \n\u2018party list\u2019 members, elected on a similar basis. While the allocation of seats to women \nmight be seen as a commendable commitment to empowering women, it is likely that the \nallowance of both women\u2019s and party seats will benefit the ruling National Congress Party \n                                                          \n94\n See the retrospective comments in As Sahafa, 9 Dec. 2000.

In northern Sudan, \neach voter will cast eight ballots (one presidential, one gubernatorial, three for the national \nparliament and three for the state parliament). In southern Sudan, there will be twelve \nballots \u2013 those above, plus one for the southern president and three for the southern \nparliament. If each voter casts all these ballots at the same time, it is likely that the process \nof polling will be very lengthy; if the votes are held on different days, the demands on staff \nand transport will be multiplied.96  \nThe election is already threatened by the failure of the NCP to create the freedom of \nassociation and movement needed for an election, and especially by displacement and \nviolence in Darfur.97 It is threatened also by the fallout from the botched census of 2008, \nwhich was intended to provide data for constituency demarcation and seat allocation. \nThrough a combination of logistical unpreparedness and political maladroitness on the part \nof the SPLM, this resulted in what would seem to be a substantial undercounting of the \nsouthern populace. The Government of Southern Sudan formally rejected the census, and \nthe allocation of constituencies which has just been made on the basis of this; what the \nconsequences of this will be for the election is not yet clear.98 And while there is evident \nenthusiasm in at least some parts of Sudan for the idea of a process that will allow people to \nchoose their leaders, it seems that popular understanding of the particular processes of the \nsecret ballot is considerably more limited.99 \nThe process of registration, which is just being completed at the time of writing (December \n2009) offers some suggestion of what may come. Information from northern Sudan has \n                                                          \n96\n Recent trial polls at the University of Khartoum suggested that it would take 24 minutes for one individual \nvoter to cast the eight ballots required in the north, and 29 minutes for the twelve ballots required in the \nsouth. \n97\n Adam O\u2019Brien, \u2018Sudan\u2019s election paradox\u2019, June 2009, URL: www.enoughproject.org \n98\n \u2018South Sudan government rejects census results\u2019, Sudan Tribune, 5 July 2009 \n99\n T.

Both multi-party and \nauthoritarian elections have confirmed the differential nature of citizenship in a state where \na fantasy of bureaucratic regularity lies over a reality of multiple networks of kinship, \ncultural familiarity, tribe and religious affiliation, and where officials have struggled to cover \nup the gap between the imaginary state of ordered efficiency and the reality ofconstant, \nexpedient, deviation from process.  When the election comes it is depressingly likely that, \nquite apart from attempts at direct cheating, and  problems with intimidation, censorship, \nrestrictions on movement and misuse of government resources,  it will see multiple failures \nin procedure, driven by shortages of transport and personnel and material. The  experience \nof many voters will once again be one of confusion, uncertainty,  reliance on intermediaries \n\u2013 or, more simply, of exclusion.  \n                                                          \n100\n See for example statement released by the Carter Center on 2 Nov. 2009: \u2018Carter Center concerned about \nvoter registration process and obstacles to observer accreditation\u2019; also  \u2018Sudan\u2019s Upper Nile state grants \nemployees time off for voter registration\u2019, Sudan Tribune website, 10 Nov. 2009; \u2018Voter registration delayed in \nJonglei\u2019s Pigi\u2019, Sudan Tribune website, 11 Nov. 2009; . \n101\n \u2018Carter Centre praises peaceful voter registration despite concerns\u2019, Sudan Tribune website, 1 Dec. 2009; \n\u2018South Sudan leads voter registration\u2019, Sudan Tribune, 9 Dec. 2009. \n"}
