The use of \ngroundwater, abstracted via open loop systems, is increasingly being considered as a means \nto provide heating and cooling for buildings, particularly in London.  In order to avoid \nunnecessary repetition between papers in the set, the background to the science of \nthermogeology and the exploitation of ground source heat is described by Banks (2009) and \nthe UK regulatory environment by Fry (2009) in which paper is also to be found an outline of \nthe hydrogeology of the London Basin where many of the UK\u2019s largest open loop ground \nsource heating and cooling schemes are located. \nThe uptake of Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) technology in the UK has been slow and \nhas lagged behind that of much of continental Europe (EEBPP, 2000; Sanner et al., 2003; \nCurtis et al., 2005). However, increasing fossil fuel prices and a greater awareness of \nenvironmental issues are creating an ever greater demand for both heating and cooling GSHP \nsystems. Recent figures released by the UK Department for Business Enterprise and \nRegulatory Reform (DBERR, 2007) estimate that the number of installations could increase \nto 10,000 units installed by 2010, 35,000 by 2015 and 55,000 by 2020. \nGSHPs can be installed at virtually any location (Rybach & Sanner, 2000), but the type of \nsystem, open or closed loop; the choice of ground collector loop, horizontal or vertical and \nthe size of the loop all depend on local geological conditions (Sanner et al., 2003; HEEBPP, \n2003; Ondreka et al., 2007). To date most installations in the UK have been for heating (with \nthe exception of recent demand for cooling in London). It is essential that the design of the \nwells for an open loop system or the collector loop for a closed loop system are optimised to \nmeet the heating or cooling demand of the building. Since the drilling of boreholes or \nemplacement of the ground collector loop represents a significant proportion of the \ninstallation costs it is important that these are not unnecessarily over engineered. The UK has \n3 \na complex geology and this has been cited as one of the factors that has led to a slow uptake \nof GSHPs in the UK (Curtis, 2001). Publications are available that list information sources \nfor the geological conditions for some countries, e.g. Rafferty (2001) for the USA. This paper \nreviews the geological factors that are pertinent to the choice and design of the ground \ncomponent of a GSHP system and presents data relevant to the UK. \nFactors impacting on the ground component of a GSHP system \nFigure 1 is a sketch of the main factors that impact on the design of the ground component of \na GSHP system. It shows a hypothetical situation where the bedrock geology is dipping and \nis exposed on the flanks of a hill. At the top of the hill the bedrock is overlain by superficial \ndeposits. The location of ground collector loops for a horizontal closed loop system and a \nvertical closed loop system are indicated by HL and VL respectively. The temperature of the \nground in the vicinity of the loops determines the temperature gradient between the ground \nand the loops that drives the heat transfer. Hence, ground temperature impacts directly on the \nheating or cooling efficiency of the system. The rock strength, thickness of superficial \ndeposits and depth of weathered bedrock all affect the ground conditions and hence the \ntrenching or drilling methods used and their associated costs. When drilling to depths of 100 \nm, several formations with different physical properties might be encountered. Each of the \nformations around the ground collector loop may have different thermal properties and these \nwill affect the heat exchange performance. Groundwater has major impacts for both open and \nclosed loop systems. Thermal properties are diminished when rocks become unsaturated and \nhence groundwater levels impact on heat exchange performance. Groundwater flow will \ntransport heat and affects the heating and cooling performance for both open and closed loop \nsystems. Downward groundwater flow is detrimental for heating applications as it generally \ntransports cooler water to depth, whilst upward flow has the opposite effect. Mine workings \ncan present a hazard when shallow as they may unexpectedly be encountered when drilling. \n4 \nHowever, at depth, mine workings can be exploited as a possible source for open loop or \nstanding water column systems (Banks et al., 2009a). \nThermal properties \nThe rate at which heat can be transferred to the heat exchanger from the ground, or to the \nground, is determined mainly by the thermal properties of the earth, i.e. thermal conductivity \nand thermal diffusivity. Thermal conductivity is the capacity of a material to conduct or \ntransmit heat, whilst thermal diffusivity describes the rate at which heat is conducted through \na medium. It is related to thermal conductivity, heat capacity and density via the equation: \n\u03c1\n\u03bb\u03b1\npC\n=  \nWhere \u03b1 = thermal diffusivity (m2s-1), \u03bb = thermal conductivity (W m-1 K-1), Cp = specific \nheat capacity (J kg-1 K-1) and \u03c1 = density (kg m-3). \nGeneral tables of thermal conductivities are available (e.g. Robertson, 1988) and typical \nvalues for UK rocks have been published by Rollin (1987) and Bloomer (1981). Thermal \nconductivity varies by a factor of more than two for the range of common rocks encountered \nat the surface. Superficial deposits and soils are complex aggregates of mineral and organic \nparticles and so exhibit a wide range of thermal characteristics. The level of water saturation \nhas a significant impact on the thermal conductivity of superficial deposits; typical values for \nwhich are shown in Table 1. For sedimentary rocks, the primary controls on thermal \nconductivity are the lithology, porosity, and extent of saturation. Mudstones and clays have \nthermal conductivities in the range 1.2-2.3 W m-1 K-1. For low porosity (<30%) shale, \nsandstone and siltstone the mean thermal conductivity is in the range 2.2-2.6 W m-1 K-1. \nWater has a thermal conductivity of 0.6 W m-1 K-1 and air a thermal conductivity of 0.0252 \nW m-1 K-1. A saturated quartz sandstone with 5% porosity might have a thermal conductivity \nof about 6.5 W m-1 K-1  but this would decrease to about 2.5 W m-1 K-1  if the rock had a \n5 \nporosity of 30%. Porosity is also the main influence on thermal conductivity of volcanic \nrocks. Low porosity tuffs, lavas and basalts may have values above 2 W m-1 K-1, but at 10% \nporosity with water saturation this might reduce to about 1.5 W m-1 K-1. For intrusive igneous \nrocks, which generally have a much lower porosity, the thermal conductivity variation is less. \nIntrusive rocks with low feldspar content (<60%), including granite, granodiorite, diorite, \ngabbro and many dykes, have a mean thermal conductivity of about 3.0  W m-1 K-1. For \nmetamorphic rocks, porosity is often very low and thermal conductivity can be related to \nquartz content. The thermal conductivity of quartzites is high, typically above 5.5 W m-1 K-1. \nFor schists, hornfels, quartz mica schists, serpentinites and marbles the mean thermal \nconductivity is about 2.9 W m-1 K-1. \nTypical rock thermal diffusivities range from about 0.75 x 10-6 m2 s-1 for clays to about 2.0 x \n10-6 m2 s-1 for high conductivity rocks such as anhydrite and pure quartzites. Most rocks have \nthermal diffusivities in the range 0.9-1.2 10-6 m2 s-1. Generally, thermal conductivity and \nspecific heat are increased for saturated rocks and diffusivity is also enhanced. Table 2 gives \nrepresentative values of thermal diffusivity and conductivity for various rock types. \nTemperature \nThe ground surface of the earth is heated by solar radiation. It has been estimated that the \nannual mean net incoming radiation is typically within the range 40-80 W m-2 for temperate \nEurope (Linacre and Geerts, 1997). Soil temperatures vary both with daily and seasonal \ncycles, the former dying out within a few 10s of cm and the latter at greater depths, but at \ndepths of about 15 m the temperature is approximately constant and equal to the mean annual \nair temperature (Rybach & Sanner, 2000). The annual function of air temperature is \ntransmitted down through the earth at a rate dependent on thermal diffusivity. Consequently \nthe temperature function in the near sub-surface has a progressive phase shift (e.g. Keery et \nal., 2007). This means that at times of minimum air temperature ground temperatures are \n6 \ngenerally slightly higher and at times of maximum air temperatures ground temperatures are \nlower (see Figure 2). This effect is well known to anyone with a cellar and is beneficial for \nGSHP heating and cooling. \nThe UK Meteorological Office collects and archives climate temperature data. Monthly and \nannual long-term average datasets have been generated for the periods 1961-1990 and 1971-\n2000 (Perry & Hollis, 2005a). Mean annual air temperatures at sea level in mainland UK \nvaries from north to south from about 8 \u2013 12 \u00b0C and the January - July mean air temperature \nswing for much of the UK is less than 15 \u00b0C (Perry & Hollis, 2005b). Mean annual air \ntemperatures show a general decrease eastwards and northwards from highest values in the \nSW of England. Since the contribution to surface temperature from terrestrial heat flow is \nvery small, the mean annual ground surface temperature should be close to the mean annual \nair temperature, although it often shows a variation of \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (Rollin, 2002). Mean annual air \ntemperatures are mainly affected by position and elevation. The slope of the local terrain, \naspect of the site, i.e. whether south or north facing and exposure of the site, i.e. sheltered or \nopen also have an effect, but it is generally small.  \nGiven a location and height, an estimate of the mean annual air temperature can be made. A \nsimple seven point polynomial function has been fitted to the UKMO annual long-term \naverage data to create a model of mean annual air temperature. A sample of UKMO stations \nfor 1995 was tested using this model. Of 451 stations the root mean square error for the fit \nwas 0.75 \u00b0C with maximum and minimum errors of +3.0 \u00b0C and \u20134.1 \u00b0C respectively. \nIncluding distance from the sea as a further element in the polynomial gave no significant \nimprovement in the model fit. Hence, a reasonable estimate of mean annual air temperature \ncan be made for anywhere in Great Britain. \nBelow a depth of around 15 m, temperatures are also affected by the small amount of heat \nthat is conducted upwards from the interior of the earth. This component is the heat flow and \n7 \na heat flow map for the UK is shown in Figure 3 (Lee et al., 1987; Downing & Gray, 1986; \nRollin, 1995; Barker et al., 2000). There is a fairly uniform background field of around 0.052 \nW m-2. Areas of increased heat flow are associated with the radiogenic granites of the SW of \nEngland and the buried granites of northern England. Values are also above the regional \nbackground over the batholith in the Eastern Highlands of Scotland. As a result of the heat \nflow, temperatures increase with depth; the average UK geothermal gradient is 0.026 \u00b0C m-1, \nbut locally it can be in excess of  0.035 \u00b0C m-1. \nIt is possible to estimate temperatures at 100 m depth by applying Fourier\u2019s Law of heat \nconduction: \nq = - \u03bb grad T \nwhere q = heat flow (W m-2), \u03bb = thermal conductivity (W m-1 K-1) and grad T = temperature \ngradient (K m-1). Thermal conductivity has been taken as the thermal conductivity of the \nbedrock geology (i.e. the rock below the soil and superficial deposits layers). The calculated \ntemperature gradient has been added to the estimate of the mean annual air temperature to \ngenerate the estimate of temperature at 100 m depth and is shown for Great Britain  in Figure \n4. The assumptions of consistent geology to 100 m depth and no contribution from \ngroundwater flow are clearly simplistic, but should not result in serious errors for the upper \n100 m. These modelled values have been compared to 90 equilibrium borehole temperature \nmeasurements at a depth of 100 m. The root mean square error between the two data sets is \n1.6 \u00b0C. The most likely cause of discrepancies between the two data sets is upwelling of \nwarmer water from depth (e.g. Brassington, 2007; Shepley, 2007). However, the effect of \nurban areas may also be significant locally (Banks et al., 2009b, Headon et al., 2009).  The \ndata reflect the two major influences of location and elevation on air temperature. The range \nin values is 4 \u2013 17 \u00b0C with the lowest values corresponding with the highest topography. \nVariation occurs between regions; the SW and eastern England are warmer and there are \n8 \nlocalised higher values across the Central Belt of Scotland.  There is also however \nconsiderable variation within regions. For instance, within the SW of England temperatures at \n100 m depth vary between 10 \u00b0C and 17 \u00b0C. \nGroundwater \nGroundwater conditions can affect the efficiency of a closed loop system, particularly as the \nthermal properties of unconsolidated sediments and rock are dependent upon the level of \nsaturation. Low permeability rocks such as mudstones are generally saturated within a few \nmetres of the ground surface, irrespective of elevation. In more permeable sandstones and \nlimestones, the unsaturated zone thickness can be large, particularly at high elevations, and \nmay alter seasonally. Sandstones, unless Palaeozoic or older in age, tend to have both \nprimary intergranular and secondary fracture permeability and hence seasonal water level \nfluctuations are generally less than those observed in limestones where the predominant \nmechanism of groundwater flow is via secondary fractures. Therefore, in the UK, the main \nareas where closed loop collector systems will be less efficient are beneath areas of higher \nground underlain by limestone (e.g. the Lincolnshire Wolds and the Cotswolds). The Chalk is \nan exception to this, as due to its very small pore throat size (median 0.7 \u03bcm or less; Allen el \nal., 1997), the water content of the unsaturated zone is nearly as high as that of the saturated \nzone and hence the thermal conductivities of both will be similar. Hence, even where the \nwater level is deep, the Chalk may be suitable for closed loop collector systems. Figure 5 \nshows that for most of Great Britain the unsaturated zone is likely to be effectively less than \n10 m thick. \nIn confined aquifers the water level may rise above the depth at which water is first struck, \nand, if overflowing artesian conditions are encountered, this can complicate the construction \nand completion of the borehole. Other potential issues include drilling on contaminated sites \nthat can result in the pollution of aquifers by the migration of surface contaminants down \n9 \npoorly constructed boreholes or piles (Westcott et al., 2003) and the connection of separate \naquifer horizons which can be prevented by casing through the upper aquifer or a securely \ngrouted section in the intervening aquitard. The requirement for grouting also has the \nadvantage of providing a good thermal contact above the water table provided that a suitable, \nhigh thermal conductivity grout is used. Unless a biodegradable or low toxicity fluid is used \nwithin the collector loops, the hydrogeology and direction of groundwater flow need to be \nconsidered in closed loop systems, particularly in horizontal slinky systems (which are more \nprone to accidental damage) or in aquifers used for potable supplies.  \nPoor quality groundwater can also be an issue, as high total dissolved solids contents, \nparticularly high chloride and sulphate ion concentrations, can be corrosive to some casing \nmaterials. The oxidation of sulphide minerals by exposure to air, in underground mines or \nsurface spoil heaps, produces acidic, dissolved metals and sulphate. Acid mine drainage is a \nmajor source of pollution in many mining areas, however as the sulphide oxidation reaction is \nexothermic, Banks et al. (2004) have speculated that this geochemical energy could be used \nby heat pumps.  \nWhere the collector loop is below the water table in an aquifer with significant groundwater \nflow, heat transport away from the site will occur. This can be helpful for single borehole \ncooling or heating systems in dispersing warmth or coolth, respectively, away from the \nborehole and bringing new cooler or warmer groundwater towards the borehole. However, \nwhere several boreholes are drilled for a larger cooling or heating system, or separate \nschemes are in close proximity, thermal interference can occur causing problems. \nGroundwater flow can have a significant impact on the GSHP design. The complexity of both \nthe GSHP design and the heat flow equations means that analytical solutions are not suitable \nand numerical modelling may be required. However, an indication of whether groundwater \nflow might be significant can be gained by comparing the relative impact on the heat \n10 \ntransport caused by conduction and that caused by convection (also referred to as forced \nconvection or advection). This comparison can be used to decide whether further numerical \nmodelling is required.  The parameter that is used for this comparison is the Peclet number \nfor energy transport, which is a dimensionless variable obtained from consideration of the \nconvection-conduction equation, i.e. \n \nwhere Pe = Peclet number, \u03c1w = density of water (kg m-3), cw = specific heat of water, (J kg-1 \nK-1), q = water specific discharge (m s-1), L = length scale (m), keff = thermal conductivity of \naquifer (W m-1 K-1), [Note: q = hydraulic conductivity x hydraulic gradient]. \nLarge Peclet numbers mean that convective transport is dominant whilst small numbers imply \nthat conductive transport is dominant. In principle this convection becomes important when \nthe Peclet number exceeds 1, but this is slightly dependent on the choice of the characteristic \nlength (Bear, 1972). This length scale is an indication of both the borehole spacing and depth \n(thickness of saturated aquifer penetrated). Table 3 indicates the Peclet number for a variety \nof materials and groundwater flow velocities. \nOpen loop systems can provide more energy than closed loop systems for the same depth of \nborehole, but can only be constructed where it is possible to abstract significant amounts of \ngroundwater from an aquifer as, although systems are generally non-consumptive overall \n(due to reinjection), they require the availability of a water resource in the first place. \nHydrogeological (or aquifer) maps are available for the UK indicating areas where there may \nbe potential for significant abstractions. In addition to the above considerations for closed \nloop systems, the following also need to be taken into account. \neff\nww\ne\nqLcP \u03ba\n\u03c1=\n11 \nThe aquifer properties of the rock (porosity, permeability, hydraulic conductivity, \ntransmissivity and storage coefficient) will affect both the availability of the required yield \nand also the interference (both hydraulic and thermal) of any multi-borehole system. For UK \naquifers, the aquifer properties manuals (Allen et al, 1997, Jones et al, 2000, Graham et al, \n2006) are useful sources of these data. When several boreholes are constructed to obtain the \nrequired yield, it is possible that interference effects (between the zones of drawdown) could \nhave a significant impact on yield. Interference effects can be minimised by the careful siting \nof the boreholes but this requires a detailed knowledge of the hydrogeology of the site. \nLicences are required for both abstraction and the discharge (or reinjection) of the hotter or \ncooler water. \nGenerally, large scale systems are designed for cooling or for aquifer thermal energy storage \nand there is a requirement to reinject large volumes of groundwater back into the aquifer. \nThis is more difficult if the aquifer is artesian. The hydraulic gradient induced by abstraction \n(drawdown) and reinjection (hydraulic mound) from two relatively closely spaced boreholes \nis likely to greatly exceed the natural hydraulic gradient. If the system is used solely for \ncooling, thermal interference is likely to eventually become a problem and, in aquifer thermal \nenergy storage schemes, it is important they are designed with balanced thermal loads over \neach annual operating cycle. It is possible that the injection borehole will not accept water at \nthe same rate that it was abstracted, due to air entrainment and\/or borehole clogging by \nparticulate matter or growth of biofilms. Altering the temperature of the water will alter the \nsolubility of some minerals and hence the water chemistry.  \nWater quality, as well as possibly being corrosive to any casing, is of importance in open \nloop systems, particularly if the water is pumped through the heat exchanger. If ions such as \niron and manganese precipitate due to oxidation, they can cause clogging. It is therefore \nimportant to keep reducing groundwaters in a closed system, preventing them coming into \n12 \ncontact with the oxygen in the atmosphere. Calcite may precipitate due to differences in \ncarbon dioxide concentration and\/or temperature and cause scaling and hydrogen sulphide \nmay accumulate. Therefore groundwaters containing dissolved gases need to be kept at a high \npressure to prevent degassing. If the water quality is particularly poor, a \u2018prophylactic\u2019 heat \nexchanger, often with a storage tank to buffer variations in flow, can be installed (Banks, \n2008). \nHowever, not all the heat added to the water from cooling systems will be dissipated via \nnatural or induced groundwater flow. A large proportion of the heat will be absorbed and \nstored in the rocks themselves and may provide a useable source of heat. The converse \napplies if the system is used for heating purposes.  \nGround conditions and geotechnical properties \nWhen a GSHP system is installed there are a number of preliminary ground engineering \naspects that need to be considered, in particular: the thickness and the nature of any \nsuperficial deposits; the depth of any weathered bedrock geology; the strength of the bedrock \ngeology and any hazardous ground conditions. It is vital that these aspects are assessed to \nensure that the appropriate GSHP installation is designed, the correct method of installation is \nused (drilling or trenching) and hence the installation is appropriately costed. In the UK the \nsuperficial and bedrock geology are very variable and form some of the most complex \ngeological terrains in the world. There are a number of datasets, now in digital form, that are \nof particular interest at the preliminary desk study phase for a GSHP installation. These are \nbriefly discussed below. \nDigMapGB is a digital geological data set that covers all of Great Britain\u2019s bedrock (formerly \nknown as solid), superficial (formerly known as Quaternary), artificial (man-made e.g. \nembankments, road cuttings) and mass movement (e.g. landslides and foundered strata) \n13 \ndeposits. These data sets allow the geological conditions encountered at a site to be identified \nand hence the ground conditions for a ground source heat pump installation to be predicted. \nThe characteristics (lithology) of the bedrock, superficial, artificial and mass movement \ndeposits are derived from the British Geological Survey\u2019s mapped 1:50,000 scale data. \nThe superficial thickness map for Great Britain has been created by assessing and modelling \nover one million borehole records held in the BGS archives. The model has been derived \nfrom geological rockhead information and provides an estimated thickness of superficial \nmaterial and therefore a depth to bedrock units. The modelling uses geological map and \ndigital terrain data to assist in the interpolation of the borehole dataset and the data provides \nthickness estimates on a 50m by 50m grid basis (see Figure 6).  \nThe Superficial and Bedrock Engineering Strength and Relative Density dataset has been \ncreated using a classification that has applied the geotechnical parameter ranges for strength \nand density as described by BS5930:1999: Code of practice for site investigations (British \nStandards Institution, 1999); see Table 4 and 5. This classification has then been applied to \nall deposits in the BGS DigMapGB Superficial and Bedrock (1:50, 000 scale) geological data \nsets. Each deposit has been given a range of either strength or relative density values \ndepending on whether the material is consolidated or granular in nature. This has then \nenabled a minimum and maximum strength and combined density map of Great Britain to be \nproduced (Figures 7a and b). A combination of geotechnical data cited in the literature and, \nwhere possible, site specific drilling data extracted from site investigation borehole records \nheld in the BGS National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) and National Geotechnical \nDatabase has been used to aid in the classification of the dataset. \nConclusions \n14 \nThe preceding sections have discussed some of the geological factors that influence the \nperformance and hence design of a GSHP system and this has been illustrated with some UK \ndata. The geology of the UK is complex and varied and so it is not possible to have general \ndesign rules for the ground collector loops of closed loop systems or for the collector wells \nfor open loop systems. For any individual system design, site specific information is required. \nFor high capacity GSHP systems it is likely that some site investigation will be necessary. \nThis is likely to include a thermal response test that provides the most accurate estimate of \nthe thermal properties at a site (Banks, 2008). However, such investigations are expensive \nand are unlikely to be undertaken for individual domestic properties. For these cases the data \nsets described in this paper should be of use in designing the system. It is possible to obtain \ncustomised reports from the British Geological Survey on a site specific basis, but this does \nincur a fee. Alternatively individual GSHP installers may be able to apply their own \nexperience in order to create the optimum design. \nThe effective use of site specific geological information will lead to improved GSHP design \nthat will in turn encourage the take-up of GSHPs. \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published by permission of the Executive Director of the British Geological \nSurvey (NERC). \nReferences \nALLEN, D J, BREWERTON, L J, COLEBY, L M, GIBBS, B R, LEWIS, M A, MACDONALD, A M, \nWAGSTAFF, S J AND WILLIAMS, A T. 1997.
