In fact, none of these studies has been carried out in physical \neducation (PE). The purpose of this study is to test the effects of an autonomy-supportive \ntraining on overt behaviours of teaching among PE teachers. The experimental group included \ntwo PE teachers who were first educated on the benefits of an autonomy supportive style and \nthen followed an individualised guidance programme during the 8 lessons of a teaching cycle. \nTheir behaviours were observed and rated along 3 categories (i.e., autonomy supportive, \nneutral and controlling) and were subsequently compared to those of three teachers who \nformed the control condition. The results showed that teachers in the experimental group used \nmore autonomy supportive and neutral behaviours than those in the control group, but no \ndifference emerged in relation to controlling behaviours. We discuss the implications for \nschools of our findings.  \n \n \nKey words: Autonomy support, controlling behaviours, teaching style, motivational climate, \nphysical education, self-determination, motivation. \n 2\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nThe effects of an experimental programme to support students\u2019 autonomy on the overt \nbehaviours of physical education teachers \n \n It is well established in the literature that students\u2019 intrinsic motivation levels decrease \nas they become older (e.g., Harter, 1981; Fredericks & Eccles, 2002; Otis, Grouzet, & \nPelletier, 2005). While motivation is inherently an individual level variable, it can be greatly \naffected by contextual factors, such as teaching styles (Turner & Patrick, 2004; Turner, \nMeyer, Cox, Logan, DiCinto, & Thomas, 1998). \n Based on the self-determination framework (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2002), the goal of \nthis paper is to test the effects of an autonomy-supportive training programme on overt \nbehaviours of teaching among physical education (PE) teachers. Over the last two decades, \nSDT has established itself as a heuristic theoretical framework to study individuals\u2019 \nbehaviours in several life contexts, including school. This theory proposes that socials factors, \nsuch as teachers\u2019 interpersonal style, influence students\u2019 motivation and engagement by \nnurturing versus thwarting three of their basics needs. These are the needs for competence \n(i.e., the desire to interact efficiently with one\u2019s environment), autonomy (i.e., the desire to be \nthe origin of one\u2019s own behaviour), and relatedness (i.e., the desire to feel connected to and \naccepted by significant others). According to this theoretical framework, the interpersonal \nstyle of those in position of authority can be conceptualized along a continuum that ranges \nfrom highly controlling to highly autonomy supportive (Deci, Schwartz, Sheinman, & Ryan, \n1981). In essence (see Reeve 2002 for a review), controlling teachers tend to take charge \n(e.g., take control of the instructional materials, use directives\/commands), be in a hurry (e.g., \nlead students towards the right answer before students have time to reflect on possible \noptions), be negative (e.g., criticise, reprimand students for their mistakes), and motivate \nthrough pressure (e.g., use rewards\/threats and exhortations). In contrast, autonomy \n 3\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nsupportive teachers are more responsive and empathic (e.g., respect students, spend time to \nlisten and acknowledge students\u2019 feelings and perspectives), more supportive (e.g., praise the \nstudents\u2019 endeavours of mastery), and more accountable (e.g., provide a rationale for tasks or \nfor restrictions they impose). Finally, autonomy supportive teachers provide choice and \nopportunities for initiative taking and independent work. Generally, students are responsive to \nthe effects of these different styles (for a review, see Deci & Ryan, 1987; Deci, Vallerand, \nPelletier, & Ryan, 1991; Reeve, 1996, 2002). For example, students of autonomy-supportive \nteachers, compared to students of relatively controlling teachers, show greater perceived \ncompetence (e.g., Deci et al. 1981; Ryan & Grolnick, 1986; Trouilloud et al., 2006), intrinsic \nmotivation (e.g., Deci, Nezlek, & Sheinman, 1981), creativity (e.g., Amabile, 1979; Koestner, \nRyan, Bernieri, & Holt, 1984), preference for optimal challenge (e.g., Harter, 1978; Pittman, \nEmery, & Boggiano, 1982; Shapira, 1976), conceptual understanding (e.g., Benware & Deci, \n1984; Boggiano, Flink, Shields, Seelbach, & Barrett, 1993; Flink, Boggiano, & Barrett, \n1990), positive emotionality (e.g., Ryan & Connell, 1989), and academic performance (e.g., \nBoggiano et al., 1993; Flink, Boggiano, & Barrett, 1990), and are less likely to drop out from \nschool (Vallerand et al., 1997). In turn, student self-determined motivation predicts leisure-\ntime physical activity intentions (e.g., Ntoumanis, 2001; Standage, Duda, & Ntoumanis, \n2003), preference for optimally difficult tasks (e.g., Standage, Duda, & Ntoumanis, 2003), \nconcentration (e.g., Ntoumanis, 2005) and effort (e.g., Ntoumanis, 2001) in the class.  \n Nevertheless, despite the benefits of an autonomy-supportive style, many teachers \nreport that the concept of autonomy is an unfamiliar \u2013 even a foreign \u2013 concept (e.g., \nBoggiano et al., 1987). Most of them use spontaneously controlling strategies (Newby, 1991); \nthe same holds true for PE teachers (Sarrazin, Tessier, Pelletier, Trouilloud, & Chanal, 2006). \nGiven that an autonomy supportive interpersonal style is more the exception than the rule in \nthe school environment, and in PE specifically, a paramount question is whether it is possible \n 4\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nto help teachers modify their existing teaching style from a relatively controlling to a more \nautonomy-supportive one.  \n To our knowledge, two studies have explored this question (i.e., Reeve, 1998; Reeve, \nJang, Carrell, Jeon, & Barch, 2004). In Reeve (1998), 159 pre-service teachers participated in \na programme intended to modify their teaching style. The teachers were randomly assigned \ninto one of three experimental groups. One condition emphasised the importance of being \nautonomy supportive toward students. The second condition promoted the use of a controlling \nstyle. The third condition was a control one and used neither autonomy supportive nor \ncontrolling strategies. The educational programme lasted 45 minutes and entailed reading an \ninstructional booklet. This booklet had the same structure in each group; after a definition of \nkey concepts, a description of one of the three instructional strategies (autonomy supportive, \ncontrolling or neutral) was followed using case studies as a medium. Then, the educational \nbenefits of the particular teaching strategy were emphasised, and finally a brief rationale was \noffered as to why experts in educational psychology valued this particular instructional \nstrategy. The effects of the programme were assessed at the end of the workshop. Compared \nto those who read an instructional booklet on a controlling and a neutral teaching style, pre-\nservice teachers who read the instructional booklet on autonomy supportive strategies \nreported an increase in their autonomous orientation. However, this study featured two \nimportant limitations. First, the teachers\u2019 actual behaviours were not assessed. A self-reported \ninterpersonal style may or may not be actualized during classroom instruction. Second, Reeve \n(1998) did not differentiate among the dimensions that constitute an autonomy supportive \nstyle. This is important as we need to know which behaviours are prone to change. For \nexample, it is possible that some teachers improve their capacity to support student autonomy \nbecause they better acknowledge the students\u2019 perspectives and\/or because they provide more \nopportunities for taking initiatives. In order to study more precisely the effects of an \n 5\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \neducational programme on teachers\u2019 interpersonal style, it is necessary to distinguish between \ndifferent categories of autonomy-supportive behaviours.  \n This limitation was addressed in the Reeve et al. (2004) study. In order to assess the \neffects of an autonomy supportive training programme on teachers\u2019 behaviours, the \nexperimenters developed an observational grid differentiating the following four aspects of an \nautonomy-supportive interpersonal style: nurture inner motivational resources; rely on \ninformational, non-controlling language; promote value in uninteresting activities; and \nacknowledge and accept students\u2019 expressions of negative affect. Twenty experienced \nteachers (as opposed to pre-service teachers as in Reeve, 1998) of maths, economics, English, \nand science, were recruited to participate to the study which took place over a 10-week \nperiod. The intervention aimed to educate teachers about how to support students\u2019 autonomy \nand consisted of two components. The first was a presentation of the basic tenets of self-\ndetermination theory, including the different types of student motivation, their consequences, \nand the characteristics of an autonomy-supportive (focusing on the four dimensions identified \nin the observational grid) and a controlling teaching style. The second component of the \nintervention consisted of a study-specific interactive website. The website was designed to \nhelp teachers translate the four autonomy-supportive instructional behaviours they learned \nabout during the informational session into their own classroom practice. For instance, \nparticipating teachers could access samples of what a classroom teacher might say and do to \nenact each autonomy-supportive behaviour via audio and audio\u2013visual clips. Teachers\u2019 \nbehaviours were subsequently scored by two trained raters over a series of three classroom \nobservations. Results showed that teachers increased their use of all four aspects of \nautonomy-supportive behaviours compared to their baseline levels. Further, the study \nrevealed that students\u2019 engagement was affected by changes in teachers\u2019 autonomy support: \nthe more teachers used autonomy support during instruction, the more engaged their students \n 6\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nwere. A limitation of this study is the format of the observational grid. Specifically, the grid \nhad a bipolar format according to which each of the four behavioural categories was assessed \non a 7-point scale ranging from a controlling to an autonomy-supportive style (e.g., from \n\u201crelies on extrinsic motivational resources\u201d to \u201cnurtures intrinsic motivational resources\u201d). \nSuch a rating format implies that a decrease in controlling behaviours will necessarily result \nin equivalent increase in autonomy-supportive behaviours. However, it is plausible that the \ntwo dimensions are independent in that, for example, while teachers could become less \ncontrolling towards their students they might not necessarily become more autonomy-\nsupportive.  \nRecent work supports our orthogonality argument (e.g., Barber, 1996; Grolnick, 2003; \nSilk, Morris, Kanya, & Steinberg, 2003) by showing weak correlations between the two \nstyles. For example, in a study dealing with the relationships between parental psychological \ncontrol, parental autonomy granting and indicators of adolescents\u2019 psychosocial functioning, \nSilk et al. (2003) suggested that psychological control is more than the absence of autonomy \ngranting. In other words, the absence of autonomy-support could be displayed via a \u201cneutral\u201d \nstyle which does not reflect the will to control people. Thus, to address such concerns, it \nappears necessary not only to rate autonomy-supportive behaviours independently of \ncontrolling behaviours, but also to take into account the neutral communications reflecting the \nteachers\u2019 will to neither control nor support student autonomy. More precisely, the latte seems \nto be told in the only intention to facilitate student progress (e.g., \u201cFold the legs to the landing \nof the jump you will succeed better\u201d).  \n The Reeve et al. (2004) study is, however, the only quasi-experimental one that has \nbeen conducted in a naturalistic teaching context. Thus, it needs to be replicated, preferably \nwith a different school subject such as PE. In PE, almost all previous studies (e.g., Ntoumanis, \n2001; Ntoumanis, 2005; Standage, Duda, & Ntoumanis, 2003) showing a positive link \n 7\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nbetween teachers\u2019 autonomy-support and students\u2019 adaptive motivation have used a \ncorrelational design with self-report data. In these studies, students were asked to complete \nquestionnaires assessing both teacher motivational strategies and their consequences (e.g., \nstudent motivation, effort, learning strategies used, etc.). This exclusive reliance on self-\nreports can lead to problems of common method variance (i.e., overestimation of construct \ninter-correlations). In addition, the concurrent assessment of all measures prevents one from \nmaking inferences regarding causality links between the variables (Pelletier, Boivin, & Allain, \n2000). In other words, whilst it is possible that teachers\u2019 greater use of autonomy support can \nincrease students\u2019 motivation and engagement in the class, it is also plausible that students\u2019 \nself-determined motivation and active engagement could lead teachers to use autonomy \nsupportive strategies to a greater extent (e.g., Pelletier et al., 2002; Sarrazin et al., 2006; \nSkinner & Belmont, 1993; Taylor & Ntoumanis, in press). Such limitations regarding causal \ninterpretations can be overcome with an experimental design.  \n Taking into account the limitations previously discussed, the purpose of the present \nstudy was to investigate the effects of an experimental programme that aimed to educate PE \nteachers about autonomy supportive behaviours. Specifically, overt PE teachers\u2019 behaviours \nwere coded via an observational grid which distinguished between different categories of \nteacher communication (i.e., autonomy supportive, controlling and neutral). It was \nhypothesised that teachers who attended the informational session on how to support student \nautonomy, would exhibit more autonomy-supportive and less controlling behaviours \ncompared to teachers who did not attend the informational session (Reeve, 1998; Reeve et \nal. 2004). We did not have a hypothesis as to which of the dimensions of teachers\u2019 behaviours \nwould be most influenced by the programme because of the scarcity of empirical evidence. \nThe study by Reeve et al. (2004) is the only one that has coded different teacher behavioural \n 8\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \ncategories, however, the results of that study might have been influenced by the measured tool \nemployed, which differed from the one we used in our study. \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants  \nFive PE teachers (3 males and 2 females, ranging in age from 29 to 40 years) and their \n96 students (47 females and 49 males from 8th to 12th grade; M age = 14.6 years, SD =2.29, \nage range = 12 - 19 years) from two junior high schools situated in the east of France were \nvolunteered to participate to the study. Three teachers (2 males and 1 female) and their 62 \nstudents comprised the control group, and 2 teachers (1 male and 1 female) and their 34 \nstudents constituted the experimental group.  \nAlthough the two schools were located in different school districts, their profiles had \nmany similarities. Specifically, both were urban schools with equivalent size, accommodating \nstudents from similar socioeconomic background (i.e., middle-class) and with similar \ngraduation rates. The two samples of teachers also had many similarities. Specifically, both \nsexes were represented in each group; the teachers had approximately the same amount of \nexperience in their job and taught classes of similar size. Finally, student characteristics which \ncould affect teachers\u2019 behaviours, such as age, sex, or level of self-determined motivation, \nwere taken into account in the statistical analysis (see below).  \n \nProcedure \nIn France, PE is a compulsory subject for all high school students. Generally, PE \nteachers teach each of several physical and sporting activities in 8-week cycles (i.e., 8 lessons \nof 2 hours). The study was conducted during a gymnastics cycle in scheduled PE lessons. \nPrior to the commencement of the study, teachers, parents, students and school administrators \n 9\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nwere asked to participate in an observational study in which video filming would be used for \nthe purposes of the study only. All participants were guaranteed anonymity. Consent to \nconduct the study was obtained from the Head Teachers of the schools and the students\u2019 \nparents.  \nThe teachers and their class were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the \ncontrol condition. Because of the nature of the investigation, the teachers of the control group \nwere not told the purpose of the study nor the specific variables under investigation. Rather, \nthey were told that the researchers were only interested in different types of student behaviour \nexhibited during PE courses. No reference was made to teachers\u2019 interpersonal style. This was \na precautionary measure taken to prevent a Hawthorne effect (e.g., Adair, Sharpe, & Huynh, \n1989) from influencing teachers\u2019 interactions with their students. Because partial deception \nwas employed, appropriate debriefing was carried out following the data collection.  \nThe teachers in the experimental group attended an informational session on how to be \nautonomy-supportive towards their students. Before the beginning of the cycle, the teachers \nparticipated in a seminar which aimed to present the characteristics and consequences of an \nautonomy-supportive teaching style. The informational session began with a presentation of \nthe basic tenets of self determination theory, including the different types of student \nmotivation (i.e., amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, \nintrinsic motivation), and the different teacher interpersonal styles (i.e., controlling and \nautonomy-supportive). Further, empirical evidence was presented to support the argument \nthat students benefit when teachers support their autonomy rather than control their behaviour. \nThe characteristics of an autonomy-supportive teacher (i.e., responsive, caring, offering clear \nadvice, choice and initiative taking) were specifically emphasized. After this introduction, \ngroup work activities were initiated in order to help each teacher apply these strategies to \nhis\/her lessons. Collaborative exercises were used to this purpose.  \n 10\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nDuring the cycle, an individualised guidance programme for each teacher was \nfollowed. Specifically, after each lesson the experimenter and the teacher, using video \nevidence, analysed the teacher\u2019s interpersonal style in order to help the teacher improve \nhis\/her capacity to support student autonomy. More specifically, this debriefing session aimed \nto find alternatives to reduce the frequency of directive commands, emphasised the \ntransmission of technical feedback using non-controlling language, helped teachers to better \nunderstand the students\u2019 point of view, and emphasised the importance of downplaying social \ncomparison. \nThe teacher-student interactions were videotaped during 6 gymnastics sessions of 2 \nhours duration using a digital camcorder. The teachers were equipped with a small \nmicrophone fixed on the collar of their sweatshirt. We also used a transceiver to allow a \nprecise recording of the content of the communications and the synchronisation between the \npictures and the sound. In order not to disturb the teacher and the students, the camcorder was \nsituated in a fixed spot with a large viewing angle, but at a sufficient distance to identify the \nstudent(s) implicated in particular interactions. All the classes were filmed during at least one \nlesson before the beginning of the data collection in order to reduce reactivity effects \nassociated with the use of the camcorder.  \nAs several studies have shown that teachers\u2019 behaviours are influenced by student \nmotivation (Pelletier et al., 2002; Sarrazin et al., 2006), we assessed students\u2019 initial levels of \nself-determined motivation during the first lesson of the cycle in order to control the effects of \nthis variable on the teacher-students interactions.  \n \nMeasures \nStudents\u2019 self-determined motivation in PE. Motivation toward PE was assessed at the \nbeginning of the teaching cycle with a PE version of the Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et \n 11\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nal., 1995), and the Academic Motivation Scale (Vallerand et al., 1992). The questionnaire \ncomprised of 28 items and assessed the multifaceted motivational regulations proposed by \nSDT using 4 items for each regulation (28 items were used in total). The stem of the \nquestionnaire was \u201cI participate in PE because...\u201d. Three subscales assessed three types of \nintrinsic motivation: to know (IMK; e.g., \u201cfor the fun of discovering new skills\/techniques\u201d), \nto accomplish (IMA; e.g., \u201c... for the satisfaction I experience while I am perfecting my \nabilities\u201d), and to experience stimulation (IMS; e.g., \u201c... for the excitement I feel when I am \nreally involved in the activity\u201d). Three subscales assessed different types of extrinsic \nmotivation: identified regulation (IDR; e.g., \u201c... because what I learn in PE will be useful \nlater\u201d), introjected regulation (INR; e.g., \u201c... because I must do PE to feel good about \nmyself\u201d), external regulation (EXR; e.g., \u201c... because I will be assessed\u201d). One subscale \nassessed amotivation (AM; e.g., \u201cI don\u2019t know why I participate in PE, if I could, I would get \nexempted\u201d). Responses were made on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 \n(strongly agree). Previous studies (e.g., Sarrazin et al., 2006; Boich\u00e9, Sarrazin, Pelletier, & \nChanal, in press) have provided evidence for the validity and reliability of this scale. In this \nstudy, each subscale had adequate internal consistency (\u03b1 > .70), thus the average of the items \nof each subscale was used for our analysis1. \nIn order to reflect the degree of students\u2019 self-determination, the self-determination \nindex was used (see Grolnick & Ryan, 1987; Vallerand & Grouzet, 2001). This index was \ncalculated by assigning each subscale a specific weight according to its respective place on \nthe self-determination continuum. The following formula was used: \n[(2*(IMK+IMA+IMS)\/3))+IDR] - [(INR+EXR)\/2)+(2*AM)]. In previous studies this index \nhas demonstrated good reliability and predictive validity (e.g., Ntoumanis, 2001; Sarrazin, \nVallerand, Guillet, Pelletier, & Cury, 2002; Vallerand & Bissonnette, 1992; Vallerand & \nGrouzet, 2001; Vallerand & Losier, 1999). \n 12\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nOvert teachers\u2019 behaviours. The observational grid developed by Sarrazin et al. (2006) \nwas used to rate teachers\u2019 behaviours. In order to have enough data to compare the two \ngroups, both frequency and type scores were computed for each student implicated in a \nteacher-student communication. Derived from self-determination theory, and specifically \nfrom previous work by Reeve in school settings (Reeve, 2002; Reeve et al., 1999), this grid \nidentifies fifteen categories of verbal interactions: organizational communications (expressed \nin an autonomy-supportive vs. controlling vs. neutral  way), technical or tactical advice \n(expressed in an autonomy-supportive vs. controlling vs. neutral  way), posing questions (in \nautonomy-supportive vs. controlling vs. neutral), use of praise, encouragement, perspective-\ntalking statements, negative communications (related to a student\u2019s discipline in the class vs. \nrelated to the student\u2019s work) and criticisms (see Table 1 for the operational definitions and \nexamples of these 15 categories). The neutral categories were added given the difficulty of \nclassifying some teaching behaviours as controlling or autonomy supportive.  \n---------------------------------------------Insert Table 1 here------------------------------------------ \n \nCoding reliability and data analysis. \nTeachers\u2019 behaviours were coded by two trained coders who were not aware of the \npurpose of the study. Five lessons were randomly selected to estimate inter-rater reliability. \nTo estimate intra-rater reliability, the two coders scored twice the same sample of lessons \ntwice weeks apart. Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficients (recommended by Bakeman & Gottman, 1997) \nrevealed a good inter-rater (between .72 to .93; M = .82) and intra-rater (between .77 to .96; M \n= .85) reliability for all categories. \nThe data were first converted in mean frequencies across all lessons for each student. \nThen, to take into account the missing values for some students, the data were converted into \nmean frequencies per lesson for each student.

If the informational \naspect is salient (e.g., when the teacher says \u201cGood job!\u201d), then praise enhances people\u2019s \nintrinsic motivation. In contrast, if the controlling aspect is salient (e.g., when the teacher says \n\u201cYou did very well, just as you should\u201d), then praise undermines people\u2019s intrinsic \nmotivation. The observational grid does not distinguish between these two types of praise \nbecause the motivational underpinning of praise is sometimes difficult to rate based on \nobserved behaviours2.  \n \nRESULTS \nPreliminary analysis \nThe observational procedure described above resulted in the collection of 5027 \ncommunications, as summed across all classes. Descriptive statistics (see Table 2) revealed a \n 14\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nprevalence of controlling and neutral behaviours when compared to autonomy supportive \nbehaviours, with differences in the distribution of these three categories between the two \ngroups.   \n-------------------------------------------Insert Table 2 here--------------------------------------------- \nWith regard to the correlation matrix, the table 3 shown that none of the autonomy \nsupportive behaviours were negatively correlated with a controlling behaviour, and that most \nof them were not correlated at all with controlling behaviours. This supports the orthogonality \nargument presented above.  \n------------------------------------------ Insert Table 3 here------------------------------------------------ \n \nDid the informational session have an impact on teachers\u2019 behaviours? \nMultiple regression analyses were performed to test our hypotheses. The three \noverarching categories (autonomy supportive, controlling and neutral) and praise \ncommunications were regressed on the condition variable (experimental vs. control) and three \ncontrol variables: students\u2019 sex, age and self-determined motivation3. In accordance with \nCohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken\u2019s (2003) recommendations, control variables were deleted \nwhen their effects were not significant and the analyses were rerun.  \nThe results (see Table 4) showed that for all dependent variables, but the controlling \nstyle, the effect of the experimental condition was significant. More specifically, the results \nrevealed that compared to the teachers in the control group, those in the experimental group \nused more autonomy supportive (\u03b2=.39; p<.01) and neutral styles (\u03b2=.28; p<.01), and praised \nmore (\u03b2=.92; p<.01) their students. With regard to the controlling style, there was no \nsignificant (\u03b2 =- .12; ns) difference between the two groups of teachers. The results also \nshowed that boys received more neutral (\u03b2=.29; p<.01) and controlling (\u03b2=.29; p<.01) \n 15\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \ncommunications, and were more praised (\u03b2=.26; p<.01) than girls; and that young students \nwere more praised (\u03b2=-.56; p<.01) than older ones.   \n-----------------------------------Insert Table 4 here --------------------- \n \nDISCUSSION \nIt is a worrying observation that in the school context students\u2019 adaptive motivation \ndecreases as they are getting older (e.g., Otis, Grouzet, & Pelletier, 2005). Among the reasons \nlikely to account for this trend, teacher communication styles play a prominent role (e.g., \nTurner & Patrick, 2004). Based on the self-determination theoretical framework (e.g., Deci & \nRyan, 1985, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2002), we were particularly interested to study teachers\u2019 \ncontrolling versus autonomy supportive behaviours. Two decades of empirical work on the \napplication of self-determination theory in the educational context, leads to three conclusions \n(Reeve, 2002): (1) self-determined students thrive in educational settings, (2) students benefit \nfrom teachers\u2019 provision of autonomy support (see Deci, et al., 1991; Reeve, 2002; Ryan & \nDeci, 2000, for reviews), and (3) teachers tend to spontaneously use controlling strategies. As \nsimilar conclusions can be made about the PE context (Sarrazin et al., 2006), the purpose of \nthis study was to test the efficacy of a training programme intended to make PE teachers \naware of the benefits of autonomy supportive behaviours on their students\u2019 motivation and \nbehavior. We hypothesized that an informational session underpinned by the basic tenets of \nself determination theory and their applications, followed by collaborative exercises and a \nconstruction of an individualised guidance programme for each teacher, can foster the \ndevelopment of such behaviours in the teaching sessions of the trained teachers.  \n In accordance with our hypothesis, the results showed that the training programme \nwas successful in helping PE teachers support their students\u2019 autonomy. Specifically, teachers \nin the experimental group, compared to those in the control group, used more frequently an \n 16\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nautonomy supportive style. Four out of five teachers\u2019 autonomy supportive behaviours were \npositively affected by the programme (i.e., organisational communications expressed in an \nautonomy supportive way, posing questions, encouragement and perspective-talking \nstatements; see footnote 2). These findings are in agreement with those reported by Reeve et \nal. (2004) who observed teachers of other subjects in the classroom and used a different rating \nmethod to code teachers\u2019 behaviours. Our rating method counted rigorously each teacher-\nstudent interaction and did not really on 7-point Likert scales to code teacher \ncommunications.  \nNevertheless, contrary to our hypothesis and the findings of Reeve et al. (2004), no \ndifferences were observed pertaining to controlling behaviours, apart from marginally less \nfrequent use by the teachers in the experimental group of negative communications related to \nthe students\u2019 discipline in the class (see Footnote 3). The divergence between our findings and \nthose by Reeve et al. (2004) can be due to the different observational tool used. Reeve and his \ncollaborators used a bipolar 7-point scale considering autonomy-supportive and controlling \nbehaviours as opposite ends of the same continuum. Thus, in this scale a high score in one \nstyle implies automatically a weak score on the other one. However, previous work (e.g., \nBarber, 1996; Grolnick, 2003; Silk et al., 2003) has shown that autonomy support and control \nare two independent dimensions. Our results corroborate these findings by showing that \nproviding greater autonomy support will not inevitably decrease a controlling style. How is \nthis possible? \nFirst, it is possible that this result could be due to the content of the training \nprogramme. The latter focused mainly on making teachers sensitive to the benefits of \nproviding autonomy support to their students and to a lesser extent on the reduction of \ncontrolling behaviours. Secondly, school-related features could account for the lack of \ndecrease in teachers\u2019 controlling style. According to Brophy (1999), the school context can \n 17\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nplace several demands on the teachers and may lead teachers to cope with pressure by using a \ncontrolling style. For instance, Pelletier et al. (2002) have shown that contextual factors \u2013\nexpectations from school authorities or parents, features of the activity taught (e.g., whether \nthey compromise student safety) or class characteristics (e.g., class size, reduced lesson time) \n\u2013 represent pressures for teachers which lead them, in turn, to be controlling toward students. \nSimilarly, other studies (e.g., Pelletier et al., 2002; Reeve, 2002; Sarrazin et al., 2006) have \nrevealed that teachers\u2019 personal characteristics \u2013 such as their expectations of students, or \ntheir lay theories and beliefs about success and the nature of competence \u2013 are likely to make \nthem more controlling towards their students. Consequently, it could be difficult for PE \nteachers to be less controlling towards students when they are worried that the safety of \nstudents might be compromised in certain sport activities, the time for lessons is reduced, or \nwhen they believe that their students\u2019 performance is not up to expected standards. \nBased on the aforementioned arguments, the more frequent use of neutral behaviours \nfrom the teachers of the experimental group, compared to those of the control group, may be \nunderstood as being a compromise for teachers between not undermining their students\u2019 \nmotivation and dealing successfully with the constraints of the teaching context. Given that \nthey do not undermine students\u2019 motivation, neutral behaviours are less detrimental than \ncontrolling ones. Finally, our results show that the teachers of the experimental group praised \nmore their students than those of the control group. Despite the fact that from a conceptual \nviewpoint praise can be expressed in both autonomy supportive and controlling ways (e.g., \nReeve et al., 1999; Reeve & Jang, 2006), this finding implies that in practice teachers use \npraise as a strategy intended to motivate and energise students\u2019 engagement in class.  \n \nLimitations and future directions  \n 18\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nThis work is not without limitations. One such limitation is the non equivalence \nbetween the two groups. Even if the units in the two groups shared common characteristics \n(e.g., schools in terms of size and pass rates, teachers in terms of teaching experience, and \nstudents in terms of socio-economic status), it is not known whether the control and \nexperimental groups were statistically equivalent in these characteristics at the beginning of \nthe study. Nevertheless, in order to take into account possible student differences, student \nself-determined motivation, sex and age were statistically controlled in the analysis. Future \nresearch should measure a number of dependent variables before and after an autonomy \nsupportive program to address the equivalence issue. \nThe sample size constitutes the second limitation of the study. The small number of \nparticipants enabled us to set up an individualised guidance programme for the teachers. \nHowever, to test the external validity of this work, it would be necessary to increase the \nnumber of teachers. In the future, it would be interesting to implement a study on a larger \nscale without, however, compromising the nature of the intervention. \nFinally, it is important to know whether students are sensitive to the change of their PE \nteacher\u2019s behaviours. Our findings showed that the teachers in the experimental group used \nmore autonomy supportive strategies but their use of controlling strategies did not decrease. \nDo these contradictory styles generate confusion for students? Another interesting question to \nexplore is whether certain types of teacher comments (e.g., controlling statements) might be \ninterpreted by students in light of the teacher\u2019s usual style. For instance, objectively \ncontrolling statements might not be perceived as highly controlling coming from an \nautonomy-supportive teacher. Thus, following the example of Reeve et al. (2004) in the \nclassroom domain, testing the effects of an autonomy supportive intervention on students\u2019 \nself-determined motivation and engagement in PE represents an intriguing future research \n 19\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \navenue, particularly in view of the well-established age-related declines in adaptive student \nmotivation patterns.  \nLastly, it is important to highlight the implications of our findings for practice and \npolicy. The past proliferation and popularity of research on behaviour modification \ntechniques, such as conditioning, explains why controlling instructional strategies permeate in \nthe teaching community (Kazdin & Bootzin, 1972; Kazdin & Wilson, 1978). In addition, both \nparents (Boggiano et al., 1987) and students subscribe to the idea that extrinsic incentives are \nnot only desirable, but also optimal motivational tools (i.e., \u201c the larger the carrot or the stick, \nthe more highly motivated the child\u201d; Boggiano et al., 1987). However, research embedded in \nthe self-determined framework reveals that such beliefs are erroneous (Boggiano et al., 1993). \nUnfortunately, the belief that controlling instructional strategies are superior to autonomy \nsupportive ones persists in the mind of practitioners even after they are exposed to \ndisconfirming evidence (Boggiano et al., 1987). Clearly, it is important to continue educating \nteachers about the benefits (and superiority) of autonomy supportive instructional strategies. \nOur results reveal that making PE teachers aware of the benefits of an autonomy supportive \nstyle can foster the use of these strategies in PE settings. \n \n 20\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nReferences \nAdair, J.G., Sharpe, D. & Huynh, C.L.

Integrated regulation was not assessed in the present study because pilot data collected \nduring the development of the SMS (Pelletier et al., 1995) revealed that this regulation did not \nemerge as a perceived reason for participation in the physical domain. Furthermore, this type \nof motivation is more often encountered among adults rather than children (Vallerand, 1997). \n \n2. As suggested by a reviewer, encouragement (like praise) could also be used in a controlling \nway. In fact, in a pilot version of the grid, we had added a supplementary category which \npermitted the raters to identify ambiguous communications such as controlling \nencouragement. No such instances were identified by the raters and, thus, in the main study \nthis supplementary category was abandoned. Further, in the most recent study on this topic \n(Reeve & Jang, 2006) it was shown that encouragement intended to boost or sustain student \nengagement (such as the type of engagement rated in our study) had the highest correlation \nwith perceived autonomy, when compared to other behaviours (Table 3, p. 214). In contrast, \nin the same study praise used as an informational tool versus as contingent reward was \npositively and negatively, respectively, correlated with perceived autonomy. \n \n3. Additional analyses were carried out testing each type of verbal interaction individually. \nSignificant differences were found in 1) the organisational communications expressed in a \nautonomy-supportive (\u00df=.25, p<.05) and neutral (\u00df=.26, p=.01) way; 2) the technical or \ntactical advice expressed in a neutral way (\u00df=.52, p<.05); 3) questions expressed in an \nautonomy-supportive (\u00df=.35, p<.001) and neutral (\u00df=.45, p<.001) way; 4) encouragement \n(\u00df=.27, p<.05); 5) perspective-talking statements (\u00df= .34, p<.01); and 6) negative \ncommunications related to the students\u2019 discipline in the class (\u00df= -.66, p<.01). \n 28\n  Autonomy supportive behaviors of PE teacher \nTable 1.
