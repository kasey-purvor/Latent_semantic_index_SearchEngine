Lynn Hulse\nwrites about Lady Anne and music, Heidi Brayman\nHackel considers Lady Anne as a book collector\nand annotator, while Stephen Orgel\u2019s complementary\npaper examines her annotations in one of her books,\na copy of the 1610 edition of the Elizabethan classic,\nA Mirovr for Magistrates.\nThe chapter which, along with Goodall\u2019s contribu-\ntion, provides the high point of a generally good\ncollection is Katherine Acheson\u2019s rather misleadingly\ntitled \u2018Lady Anne Clifford\u2019s Writing Style\u2019. Firmly\ngrounded in (beautifully expounded) literary theory,\nthis culminates in a discussion of the inscriptions in\nthe Great Picture, which she relates to the emblem\ntradition, but chooses to designate \u2018complementary\ntext\u2019, a coinage which is helpful both here and\nwhen extended to other contemporary forms which\ncombine visual and textual elements, such as funerary\nmonuments. This is also the paper which brings out\nmost clearly the attractiveness and fascination of Lady\nAnne, which make her such a delightful subject:\nAcheson avoids the common trap of theorists: a lack\nof appreciation that the object of theory is also a\nperson. The cross-disciplinary approach of the book is\nwelcome: the Yorkshire Archaeological Society is to be\ncongratulated on including it in its Occasional Papers\nseries. A more stringent editorial approach would have\nreduced repetition of the facts of Lady Anne\u2019s life;\nreproduction of the illustrations is sometimes poor,\nmost disappointingly in the case of the Great Picture,\nwhich is muddy and at a small scale. That said, this\nis a valuable addition to scholarship on Lady Anne\nClifford: Goodall\u2019s and Acheson\u2019s studies will also be\nfascinating and stimulating to all who study early\nmodern material culture.\nJEAN WILSON\nDepartment of English, Boston University, USA and\nHarlton, Cambridge, UK (Email: jlw29@cam.ac.uk)\nSTEPHEN WEINER. Microarchaeology: beyond the\nvisible archaeological record. xviii+396 pages, 95\nillustrations, 4 colour plates, 13 tables. 2010.\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press; 978\u20130\u2013\n521\u20138803\u20139 hardback \u00a355 & $95; 978\u20130\u2013521\u2013\n70584\u20134 paperback \u00a324.99 & $36.99.\nSteve Weiner\u2019s years of experience studying minerals\nin the archaeological record are summed up in this\nbook under the novel rubric of microarchaeology\n\u2014 the study of the archaeological record, not just\nthrough microscopes, but chemically, biochemically\nand (especially) mineralogically.\nMost of this well-illustrated book is suitable as a\ntext for students who have taken at least a first\ncourse in archaeolog-\nical science. Chapter\n2 gives a general\noverview of the range\nof microarchaeology\nand chapters 4\u201310\ngive more detail, with\na distinct emphasis on\nareas that have fea-\ntured in Weiner\u2019s own\nresearch. Each chapter opens with a review of basic\nconcepts, and then each material is described, its oc-\ncurrence and diagenesis on archaeological sites are dis-\ncussed, and the information about the past that is em-\nbedded in it is outlined. In this way a great deal of ex-\ncellent, well-structured information is conveyed about\nthe mineral components of the archaeological record\n(chapter 4), bones and teeth (chapter 5), phytoliths,\ndiatoms, eggshells, otoliths and mollusc shells (chap-\nter 6). Weiner\u2019s detailed understanding of the forma-\ntion and composition of biominerals shows in the\ndiscussion of their occurrence and their potential to\nyield archaeological information. The structure works\nwell as a didactic framework, but leads to repetition;\nfor example, there are at least three places where the\nformation of limescale in kettles is described as leading\nto aragonite not calcite. The archaeological examples\ngiven are primarily from subtropical and tropical cli-\nmates, and I wonder to what extent the techniques and\nresults are transferrable to cooler and wetter climates.\nChapter 7 moves from minerals to pyrotechnological\nprocesses, covering wood ash, charcoal, plaster and\nmortar, and ceramics. Drawing on Weiner\u2019s own\npublications, there is a particularly useful section on\na conceptual framework for the diagenesis of the\nproducts of fire; the section on ceramics, on the other\nhand, is short given the extent of previous microscopic\nand chemical study of pottery, and metals and glass\nare excluded. Chapter 8 on biomolecules is structured\naround the idea that biomolecules survive in protected\nniches where microorganisms cannot attack them.\nFor me, this chapter was less successful because the\ncontent is heavily dependent on review articles, some\nof them relatively old, such as 1993 for lipid residues\nin pottery and 2001 for ancient DNA. Chapter 10\napplies the ideas of earlier chapters to assessing the\nquality of radiocarbon dates, but completely omits\nreference to the four decades of literature on this topic\nthat has appeared in this journal and elsewhere.\n687\nReview\nThe final chapters are practical accounts of operating\nan on-site laboratory and \u2018an in-depth overview of the\nuse of infrared spectroscopy for analysing the microscopic\nrecord\u2019 (to quote the back cover). These chapters will\nbe very useful to practitioners, but they are at an\nentirely different level to the rest of the book.\nOther parts of the book are more of a manifesto,\ncalling for change in the way we investigate and\nconceive the archaeological record to take greater\naccount of microarchaeology. Chapter 1 argues\nthat archaeology is based on the interpretation of\nobservations, and consequently we are missing a lot if\nwe omit microarchaeological observations. Hence the\nnext generation of archaeologists must be conversant\nwith all aspects of the archaeological record, including\nmicroarchaeology, and able to interpret it with its\nambiguities. Chapter 3 assesses the (in)completeness\nof the record, showing that mineralogical stability can\nbe used to differentiate materials lost from those never\npresent on a site. After considering each material,\nchapter 9 returns to this idea with ethnoarchaeological\nstudies incorporating microarchaeology, and thought-\nexperiments (or Gedankenexperimente) about the\nmicroarchaeological record generated in an Eskimo\nwinter house and a Zagrosian village. These are\nthought-provoking discussions of information usually\nconsidered lost to archaeological investigation, but\npotentially accessible via microarchaeology. For\nexample, might it be possible to distinguish between\nwood and dung as fuel using burnt phytoliths?\nOverall I found this book both rewarding and\nfrustrating. The conceptual frameworks for microar-\nchaeology are admirable and form an agenda for\nfuture research. However, the repetitions, sometimes\nonly two pages apart, could have been eliminated, and\nAppendix B (a list of infra-red spectra downloadable\nfrom the author\u2019s website) is unnecessary. The main\ntext concludes with a discussion of the infra-red\nspectrum of nitrate salts, whereas the book really\nneeds an epilogue to draw together all its arguments\nin favour of microarchaeology. Despite its limitations,\nthis book will find a place on my reading lists and the\nfinal chapter will ensure that a copy is kept next to our\ninfra-red spectrometer. It is also a book to return to\nin future for stimulating ideas on microarchaeological\nresearch.\nANDREW R.

London: Stacey In-\nternational; 978\u20131\u2013906768\u201329\u20134 paperback \u00a39.99.\nRobert Carter\u2019s book should be read as a stimulating\naccount about how science is undertaken and\ndisseminated. Don\u2019t\nbe put off by the\nprefatory essay by\nTom Stacey in which\nhe suggests \u2018the science\nof anthropogenic global\nwarming [. . .] has been\nfertilized at its incep-\ntion by the Green-ish,\nNew Age-ish miasma of\nthe Sixties, and its aura\nof ideological anarchism\u2019 (p. 13). Don\u2019t be put off by\nCarter\u2019s periodic lapse into hyperbole (e.g. suggesting\nthe public debate on climate change is driven \u2018by strong\nenvironmental lobby groups and evangelistic scientists\nand journalists\u2019 (p. 21). Don\u2019t be put off by his\napparent inconsistency (e.g. noting that scientific\nconsensus is an oxymoron (p. 25) when the term\nappears in the title of his book and in chapter\n9). Carter is a scientist frustrated by the silliness\nof many aspects of the climate change debate. He\nrefers, for example, to a website that lists the many\nthings attributed to climate change which \u2018starts with\nacne, progresses through circumcision in decline, haggis\nthreatened, polar bears deaf, seals mating more, short-\nnosed dogs endangered, and finishes with yellow fever\u2019\n(p. 130).\nCarter is a passionate \u2018old school\u2019 scientist; he is not\na climate change \u2018denier\u2019. His view is entirely sensible\ngiven current knowledge: \u2018It is certain that natural\nclimate change will continue in the future as it has in\nthe past . . . In the face of this, it is clearly most prudent to\nadopt a climate policy of preparation for, and adaptation\nto, climate change . . . Once in place, these same plans\nwill provide an adequate response to any human-caused\nchange should it emerge in measurable quantity at some\nfuture date\u2019 (p. 217).\nThe key points of this book appear in Carter\u2019s\npreface. There is a science reality in which climate\ncan be seen as a complex, dynamic natural system\nthat no one can wholly comprehend. Computer-\ngenerated models have different outcomes depending\non the parameters used. Competent scientists from all\ngroups accept that global climate has always changed\nand always will. Human activities definitely affect\nlocal climate and summed may affect global climate\n688\n"}
