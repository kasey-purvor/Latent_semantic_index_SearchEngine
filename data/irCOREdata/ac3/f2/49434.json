A logit model for the \n1990-92 and the 1998-2000 cohorts reveals that the probability of dropping out depends on both \nthe medical school attended and the personal characteristics of the students, including academic \npreparedness. Almost none of the increase in the dropout rate between the two cohorts can be \nexplained by changes in observable characteristics of the students over this period. Instead, most \nof the increase in the dropout rate is associated with changes at the level of the institution and in \nunobserved student characteristics. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nUniversity effects, rather than changes in observed student characteristics, explain most of the \nincreased dropout rate over the time period considered. Candidate explanations behind these \neffects include: less effective admissions policies; changing curricula, greater costs of attending \n   3\nmedical school and a growing mismatch between student and school characteristics. Testing \nbetween these competing hypotheses is left for future work. \n \nKEYWORDS Education, Medical, Student dropouts, Non-completion probabilities, \nStudent background, Prior qualifications, Logistic Regression,  Cohort Study, UK \n   4\nOVERVIEW \nWhat is already known on this subject \nRecent years have seen increases in the number of students entering UK medical schools and in \nthe proportion dropping out.  \n \nWhat this study adds \nFor the 1990-92 and 1998-2000 cohorts we find the probability of dropping out of medical \nschool is lower for students (i) with better prior qualifications, (ii) with a parent who is a doctor, \n(iii) living on campus.   \n \nSuggestions for further research \nDespite the richness of our data, we find the increase in the dropout rate is mostly explained by \nchanges in unobserved characteristics of students and medical schools. Future work should \nconsider the influence of: admissions policies; changing curricula; social integration, and \nmedical school fees. \n \n \n \n   5\n1. INTRODUCTION \nIn earlier work published in this Journal we investigated the factors affecting the probability of \ndropping out in the first year of medical school for the full populations of UK medical students \nover the period 1980 to 1992.1 However, since 1992 many changes have taken place which are \nlikely to have impacted on dropout probabilities, raising the issue of the extent to which results \nfor earlier cohorts are informative for more recent cohorts. For recent cohorts of students the \nsubject background at A-level is substantially more diverse compared to earlier. Similarly, there \nhave been important curriculum and pedagogical changes Given all these changes, an analysis \nof the factors associated with the probability that a student will drop out of medical school is \ntimely and important and updates earlier research.1,3,4 This paper analyses the data for both the \n1990-1992 and the 1998-2000 cohorts. A particular interest is in the question of how the \nprobability of dropping out \u2013 and the influence of its main drivers \u2013 changed across the two \nperiods. \nThe analysis of student dropout behaviour has received much attention both in the UK \nand in the US, 5,6 where one of the most influential theoretical explanations of student attrition is \nthe path analyses model.7  This class of model emphasises the influence of both academic \npreparedness and the social integration of students in college. The former is measured in our \nanalysis through a wealth of information in the data regarding students\u2019 prior qualifications. The \nargument regarding social integration - or social \u2018match\u2019 - suggests that a student\u2019s propensity to \nwithdraw from their studies will be influenced not only by the extent of the academic challenge \nthey find on their course but also by the extent to which the social environment appeals to the \nstudent. The literature suggests that key aspects of this are likely to include factors such as the \ndemographic composition of the student body and residential and other social amenities of the \ninstitution. Many of the relevant factors are not observable and hence are simply captured within \nthe general university effect. However, we do observe many of the student\u2019s personal \ncharacteristics and these in part will be associated with the likely extent of social match. In \n   6\nparticular, we also observe whether the student lives on or off the university campus as this is \nlikely to be associated with the success of student integration. \nWe focus exclusively on the probability that a medical student will drop out of their \ndegree course by the end of their first year of study. A student is defined to have dropped out if \nthey are not observed to be a registered student on their medical degree after their first year of \nstudy. Students failing and repeating their first year are not defined as having dropped out. We \nconcentrate our analysis on the first-year dropout probability because as shown in previous \nwork,8 the determinants of the dropout probability are significantly different for first year \nstudents compared to those for subsequent year students.  \nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents \nsummary statistics. Section 3 presents results of the binomial logit regression analysis of the \nfirst-year medical student drop-out probability. Section 4 concludes with a summary of the \nresults and further remarks. \n \n2. THE DATA AND SUMMARY STATISTICS  \nWe analyse administrative data on all students beginning a medical degree in the UK for \nentry cohorts of students: 1990-1992 cohorts and 1998-2000 cohorts. We pool together three \nyears of data for each of the two cohort groups in order to have sufficiently large cell sizes for \nthe analysis: this follows from the fact that there is a relatively low dropout rate in each year.  \nThe data for the period 1990-1992 come from the Universities\u2019 Statistical Record (USR). Data \nfor the period 1998-2000 come from the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA). Data for \nthe period 1993 to 1997 are not of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis. \n \nSummary statistics \nTable 1 presents summary statistics on various characteristics of the students across the two \ncohort groups (using the 3 years which make up each cohort group) broken down by sex. For \neach block of statistics, the first column shows the proportion of those students with various \n   7\ncharacteristics, the second column reports the corresponding proportion for the sub-samples of \nstudents who dropped out.  \nAcross the two cohort groups the number of students grew from an annual average of \n4,125 (based on 6107 male and 6204 female students) in the 1990-1992 cohort group to 4,876 in \nthe cohort group for 1998-2000. The data do not include those students who entered medical \nschools on postgraduate entry schemes.  \nThe average first year dropout rate was 3.5% for the earlier cohort group and 4.9% for \nthe later cohort group.  For the 1990-1992 cohort group, there is a lower proportion of males \namong the dropout group than in the total population of medical students, however this is \nreversed for the 1998-2000 cohort group. The age structure of medical students has also been \nchanging with a shift towards older students in the later cohort group.  \nIn order to make our results comparable to the already published set of results1, we have \ncarried out our analysis including those students who were overseas (non-EU) students. From \nTable 1, we see that an increasing proportion of students over the two cohort groups were \noverseas students and these students appear to have a higher drop-out rate than EU students. \nOverseas student fees are substantially higher than EU fees; in fact, for the first cohort group, \nEU students\u2019 tuition fees were zero. Tuition fees for EU students were introduced only in 1998 \nand hence applied only to the second cohort. From the table, we also see that a large proportion \nof students lived in on-campus accommodation and these students have a markedly lower drop-\nout rate than students living off-campus, consistent with the social integration argument. 8\nFor the 1998-2000 cohort group, we have information on disability and ethnicity. With \nrespect to the latter, more than two-thirds of female students were from a white ethnic \nbackground. The largest single other ethnic category was students with an Indian family \nbackground. A large proportion of medical students came from a family in which a parent was a \nmedical doctor or from some other professional background, and these students have a lower \ndropout probability. \n   8\n Prior to entering university, most UK students study in schools which can broadly be \ndescribed as either private sector (henceforth, \u2018Independent\u2019 schools) or state sector (Local \nEducation Authority - LEA). The proportion from Independent schools is much higher than for \nmost other university courses in the UK. Information provided on previous schooling for the \n1998-2000 cohort group is very poor with more than 60% with missing values, and is therefore \nnot incorporated in the analysis.  \nThe pre-university secondary school qualifications which form part of the basis for \noffers of places at medical schools are, typically, \u2018A-levels\u2019 for English and Welsh school \npupils, and \u2018Highers\u2019 for school pupils from Scotland. Passes at A-level are classified as A (=10 \npoints) through to E (= 2 points). Passes in Highers are classified as A (=3 points) through to C \n(=1 point).  \nThe proportion of students with A-levels has been increasing slightly among both male \nand female students. Table 1 reveals the extent to which the dropout rate varies by the students\u2019 \nA-level (or Higher) subjects and grades. Those students who had already been awarded a degree \nprior to becoming medical students are less likely, on average, to drop out of medical school.  \nOf those who had A-level qualifications, almost all students had taken Chemistry. While \nthere was a rise in the proportion of those with Biology, there was a marked fall in the \nproportion with Physics. Overall, students with Biology at A-level were less likely to drop out \nthan others. Over the two periods the proportion with the top score of 30 points at A-level grew, \nwhich could indicate that the average academic quality of the intake improved despite \nexpansion, but could also reflect grade inflation. These two trends are likely to be related as \nPhysics tends to produce below average A-level points scores.  \nIn Table 2 we report the results for the Pearson chi-squared statistic of independence \nbetween the dropout variable and various explanatory variables. For the 1990-1992 cohort \ngroup, with the exception of the qualification variables, there is little evidence of any association \nbetween dropping out and any of our other variables, which contrasts markedly with the \nfindings for the 1998-2000 cohort group.  \n   9\n3. RESULTS FOR THE PROBABILITY OF DROPPING OUT \nWe conduct a binomial logit regression analysis of the probability that an individual \nwithdraws from their medical degree during their first year of study. Initially we allow the \ncoefficients on the variables to vary according to both the sex of the student and the cohort \ngroup to which the student belongs. This most general model is then reduced by excluding those \nvariables which were insignificant at the 5% level. The final restricted model is reported in \nTable 3, which reports coefficient estimates (equivalent to the effect of the variable on the log \nodds ratio) and their standard errors for two specifications. The first specification (Model 1) \nuses all available variables. The second specification (Model 2), discussed below, uses only \nthose variables which are common to both cohort groups. Although not reported in Table 3, the \nmodels also include binary indicator variables for the university the student attended.  \nAs can be seen from the table, the estimated coefficients are very robust across the two \nmodels. It is also noticeable that few of the coefficients change across the two cohort groups. In \norder to discuss and interpret the results in more detail, we calculate predicted probabilities and \nmarginal effects associated with specific variable changes for individuals in each cohort group. \nBased on the results of Model 1 reported in Table 3, we report in Table 4 the predicted \nprobability (\u00d7100) of dropping out for two types of default individuals; one based on the 1990-\n92 cohort group and one based on the 1998-2000 cohort group. We then change a single \ncharacteristic of our \u2018typical\u2019 individual and recalculate the probability of dropping out. The \ndifference in these two probabilities is referred to as the marginal effect associated with that \nchanged characteristic.  \nFrom Table 4 we observe that individuals in the 1998-2000 cohort group are around 1.5-\n2.5 percentage points more likely to drop-out compared to equivalent students in the earlier \n1990-92 cohort group. One hypothesis to explain this is that the introduction of EU fees for the \nlater cohorts could have raised the dropout rate. \n \n   10\nPersonal characteristics:   From Table 4 we find that the predicted probability (\u00d7100) \nof dropping out for our default modal female student in the 1990-92 cohort group is 4.05%, an \nequivalent male student has a predicted probability of dropping out of 3.33%. Therefore the \nmarginal effect of being male (compared to female) is approximately 0.72, implying that males \nare around 0.72 percentage points less likely to drop out than equivalent female students. Note \nthat as the logit model is not linear and as the default individual has modal and not mean \ncharacteristics, there is no reason for the predicted probabilities to coincide with those reported \nin Table 1. For the 1998-2000 cohort group, the predicted probability of dropping out for our \n\u2018typical\u2019 (default) female is lower than that observed for the 1990-92 cohort group as our typical \nfemale has better A-level qualifications than were assumed for the earlier cohort group. For the \n1998-2000 cohort group we note that there is little difference in the dropout rates for males \ncompared to females, with males 0.09 percentage points more likely to drop-out. \nThere are no significant age effects for the 1990-92 cohort group, but there are for the 1998-\n2000 cohort group. We find that 20 and 21 year olds are more likely to dropout by around 1.4-\n2.7 percentage points compared to 18-19 year olds, whereas the more mature students (>21 \nyears old) are around 1 percentage point less likely to drop out compared to the 18-19 year old \nstudents.  \nFor the 1990-92 cohort group, there were no significant overseas student effects. However, \nfor the 1998-2000 cohort group female (male) overseas students were around 1.9 (1.2) \npercentage points less (more) likely to dropout than our typical female (male). Multivariate \nanalysis thus confirms the findings in the raw data (Table 1). \nThere are significant effects associated with university accommodation; students living off \ncampus are more likely to drop out by around 1.7 percentage points (irrespective of the cohort \ngroup). This is consistent with the path-analysis model and of its emphasis on social \nintegration.6  There are no major effects associated with recorded disability.  \n \n   11\nSocial Class and ethnicity background: Ethnic background of the student is recorded only \nfor the 1998-2000 cohort group. We find that Indian females are around 1.9 percentage points \nless likely to drop out compared to white females, whereas Indian males are no different from \nwhite males. Other ethnic groups are less likely to dropout by around 0.8 percentage points. On \nsocial class, we find that female students from a background in which a parent is a medical \ndoctor have a significantly lower probability of dropping out, by around 1 percentage point; for \nmales, there is no such effect. \n \nPrior qualifications and school background:  We find that students who had already \nobtained a degree prior to registering for a medical degree are significantly less likely to drop \nout, by around 2.4 percentage points, compared to a student with A-levels only. For the \npurposes of this comparison, we assume that the student with a degree had similar A-levels to \nthose students getting into a medical school with only A-levels. This is a remarkably strong \neffect. It suggests that the creation of post-graduate medical schools could well have a beneficial \neffect on progression, ceteris paribus. The marginal effect on Highers shows that, compared to \nan A-level student, these students are around 2 percentage points more likely to drop-out in the \n1990-92 cohort group, whereas in the 1998-2000 cohort group this effect is much smaller. \n We find strong effects of A-level performance on dropping out. The estimated marginal \neffects imply that each extra A-level grade (equivalent to 2 A-level points) in Biology reduces \nthe probability of dropping out by approximately 0.86 percentage points. Our results are \nconsistent with previous work showing that students with A-level Biology do better in their pre-\nclinical years.9,10  By comparison, an increase of 1 grade in either Chemistry or Physics reduces \nthe probability of dropping out by approximately 0.5 percentage points. We find that having \nstudied mathematics, regardless of the grade, reduces the probability of dropping out by 0.5 \npercentage points. There is also an additional negative effect on the drop out probability of the \norder of 0.71 percentage points for those students with the maximum score (Topscore) of 30 \n   12\npoints, though this is only for the 1998-2000 period. Academic preparedness clearly exerts a \nsubstantial influence on the probability of dropping out.  \n \nMedical school effects: Tables 3 and 4 show results based on a specification in which \nbinary indicator variables were included for each medical school. For reasons of confidentiality \nthe identity of individual medical schools cannot be revealed. However, in Figure 1 we plot the \nmedical school coefficient estimates (and their 95% confidence intervals), relative to a base \nmedical school, for both males and females for the 1998-2000 cohort group. From the figure we \ncan see that there are a number of significant university effects. There is also a relatively high \ncorrelation (of 0.76) between the coefficient estimates for males and females (for 1990-92 \ncohort group the dispersion is slightly greater and the correlation lower at 0.62). This is reflected \nin the figure by the narrow dispersion of points around the 45\u00b0 line. However, for 15 of the 19 \nestimated medical school effects the associated confidence intervals do not cross the 45\u00b0 line \u2013 \nimplying significant differences in the estimated medical school effects for males compared to \nfemales. Figure 2 plots the medical school coefficients and confidence intervals for the 1990-92 \nand 1998-2000 cohort groups, for males only. Again, there are a number of significant effects \nfor both cohorts. These estimated medical school effects have a relatively high correlation (of \n0.63) between the point estimates over time (although this is only 0.16 for females). Despite \nthis, there are significant differences over time in the estimated medical school effects and it is \nnoticeable that the effects have tended to shift upwards. \n \nChanges over time: In order to address the question of the extent to which the rise in the \ndropout probability across cohort groups arises from changes in the observed characteristics of \nmedical students, we have conducted a decomposition analysis11 (based on Model 2), the results \nof which are reported in the second set of columns in Table 3. These results are qualitatively and \nquantitatively very similar to those of Model 1. The decomposition procedure involves \n   13\npredicting what the probabilities of dropping out for students in the earlier cohort would have \nbeen using the estimated coefficients from the later cohort, and vice-versa.  \nFor males (females), the average predicted probability of dropping out for the 1990-92 \ngroup is 3.3% (3.7%). When these students are attributed the estimated coefficients generated \nfrom the regression conducted on the 1998-2000 cohort group, the average predicted probability \nrises to around 5.5% (4.9%): a rise of 2.2 (1.2) percentage points. The actual dropout rate for the \n1998-2000 cohorts is 5.3% (4.5%). Reversing the decomposition and using 1998-2000 cohort \ngroup, but taking the estimated coefficients generated from the regression conducted on the \n1990-92 cohort group, the average predicted probability of dropping out is 3.5% (3.8%). In \neither case then, the evidence is that the increase in the dropout rate is not explained by changes \nin observed characteristics of students over time. Instead, the increase is associated with changes \nin unobserved characteristics. For example, we incorporate in our analysis a wealth of \ninformation on prior qualifications, such as A-level performance: accordingly, we can conclude \nthat a rise in the dropout rate is not attributable to a simple fall in student quality as measured by \nA-level results. Of course, measures of prior performance might not reflect underlying potential, \nwhich is unobservable within the data. If A-levels have become more weakly correlated with \nability (for example through grade inflation), then this would be a potential reason for a rise in \nthe dropout rate associated with a change in an unobservable characteristic.   \nThere are, of course, many unobservable characteristics which are potentially important \nin explaining the increase in the dropout rate of medical students over time. We can group these \ninto unobserved student characteristics and unobserved institutional characteristics. Personal \nstudent characteristics which we do not observe but which might be important include personal \nmotivation and commitment. It is interesting that current medical school admission procedures \nare tending to put more weight on these attributes. A second student-level characteristic \nconcerns the student\u2019s social integration into medical school: with the changing nature of the \nsocial and demographic composition of medical students and with expansion, it is conceivable \nthat social integration has changed \u2013 though our data do not permit us to analyse these factors \n   14\nthoroughly. Among unobserved institutional characteristics, we would include tuition fees and \ncurriculum design. It is interesting that although the institutional effects are not uniform across \nmedical schools, the dropout probability has increased in the great majority of cases, suggesting \nthat characteristics common to the sector generally \u2013 rather than institutionally-specific \u2013 lie \nbehind the rising dropout rate. \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS \nWe have presented the results of an analysis of the probability of dropping out of a UK medical \nschool for all first year students entering a medical school in the period either 1990-92 or 1998-\n2000. We have noted that over the two periods there was a substantial increase both in the size \nof the entry cohort and in the proportion of students dropping out of medical school and that \nthere were also changes in the average characteristics of students.  \nWe have found that the probability of dropping out of medical school tends to be lower, \ninter alia, for (i) students living on campus, (ii) students with a parent who is a doctor, (iii) \nstudents with better prior qualifications.   \n A main focus of the paper has concerned the question of why the dropout rate increased \nover time. In a decomposition analysis, we have found that little of the increase in the dropout \nrate for either males or females is attributable to adverse changes in observed student \ncharacteristics, with most being explained by changes in unobserved characteristics of students \nor of medical schools. Unobserved personal attributes are likely to include factors such as the \napplicant\u2019s commitment, resilience, and motivation to study medicine. These are likely to be \ndiscernible to the selector in appropriately designed and structured interviews and aptitude tests. \nOur results therefore offer further justification for current trends in selection procedures away \nfrom purely academic criteria and toward applicants\u2019 relevant personal qualities if further \nmedical expansion and policies for accessibility are to avoid costly increases in the rate at which \nstudents drop out of medical school.12 \n   15\nCONTRIBUTORS \nNone. \nACKNOWLEDGEMNTS \nWe would like to thank Paranjothy Arulampalam, seminar participants at the University of \nNottingham and Warwick, and Chris McManus and another referee for helpful comments.

The models allow the coefficients on all variables to differ according to the cohort to which the \nstudent belongs by using a binary indicator variable Hesa; the coefficient on this then measures the \neffect of a student belonging to the cohort 1998-2000, compared to the default case of a student \nbelonging to the earlier 1990-92 (USR) cohort. In addition, we allow coefficients to vary according to \nthe student\u2019s sex by using the binary indicator variable Male; the coefficient on this then measures the \neffect of the student being male, compared to the default case of being female. We also include the \ninteraction of these two variables, Male_Hesa, which measures the additional effect of being both \nmale and belonging to the HESA cohort. \n \n   20\nTable 4: Predicted Probability (\u00d7100) and marginal effects (\u00d7100) of dropping out \nfor specific types of individuals \n \nIndividual type Probability1 ME \nCohort 1990-92   \nDefault2 4.047  \nDefault \u2013 Male 3.327 -0.720 \nDefault \u2013 Non-campus accommodation 5.786 1.739 \nDefault \u2013 Parent is a doctor 3.021 -1.026 \nDefault \u2013 Male and parent is a doctor 3.433 0.1065\nDefault \u2013 Highers 6.065 2.019 \nDefault \u2013 Degree already 1.688 -2.358 \nDefault \u2013 A in A-level Biology 3.183 -0.864 \nDefault \u2013 A in A-level Chemistry3 3.526 -0.520 \nDefault \u2013 A-level Maths 3.413 -0.633 \nDefault \u2013 1998-2000 cohort 5.597 1.551 \nDefault \u2013 1998-2000 cohort and male 5.754 2.4275\n   \nCohort 1998-2000   \nDefault4  3.106  \nDefault \u2013Male 3.195 0.089 \nDefault \u2013 Age=20 5.788 2.682 \nDefault \u2013 Age=21 4.473 1.368 \nDefault \u2013 Age>21 2.024 -1.081 \nDefault \u2013 Overseas 1.218 -1.888 \nDefault \u2013 Male and overseas 4.385 1.1905\nDefault \u2013Indian 1.173 -1.933 \nDefault \u2013 Male and Indian 3.146 -0.0485\nDefault \u2013 Highers 3.360 0.254 \nDefault \u2013 Top A-level score 1.877 -0.7095\nNotes: \n1.

The default person is white female aged 18 or 19 years old, not disabled and is from a social \nclass background in which neither parent is a doctor. She has only taken A-levels and has a B \nin Biology and a B in Chemistry, but has no Physics or Mathematics A-level. She went to \nuniversity in the 1990-92 cohort group and lived in on-campus accommodation in her first \nyear.  \n3. The dropout probability of the equivalent student as above with a B in Physics rather than \nChemistry has almost exactly the same dropout probability. \n4. The same default person is as above except she had an A in her Biology and Chemistry A-\nlevels and a B in A-level Physics.  She went to university in the 1998-2000 cohort group. \n5.
