The predominant material \nused is low cost ductile sheet metal which can be readily stamped to shape and \njoined. During the past 20 years crashworthiness simulation of these structures has \nproven remarkably good, largely because crashworthiness explicit Finite Element \n(FE) codes, such as [1, 2] can accurately predict the simple plastic bending and \nstretching deformation mechanisms that occur. It is not usually necessary to predict \nmaterial failure. \nIn recent years automotive manufacturers are increasingly using new \nlightweight materials to reduce weight; these include Plastics, Composites, \nAluminium, Magnesium and new types of High Strength Steels. Many of these \nmaterials have limited strength or ductility, or may be used in highly loaded \napplications; in each case rupture is a serious possibility during the crash event. \nFurthermore, the joining of these materials presents another source of potential \nfailure. Both material and joining failure will have serious consequences on vehicle \n 3\ncrashworthiness and must be predictable if the numerical model is to be reliably used \nin the design process. \nA large amount of research work concerning numerical modelling of material \nfailure can be found in the literature [3]. However, unfortunately, this work is usually \nnot appropriate for practical crashworthiness analysis using an explicit Finite Element \ncode which is the established numerical technique for crash simulation. \nConsequently, it has been necessary to undertake a dedicated European \n(Framework V) research project, IMPACT [4], to develop models and methodologies \nfor failure prediction. This work has been carried out within the commercial \ncrashworthiness FE code PAM-CRASH [1]. \nThe IMPACT project was initiated in 2000 and completed in 2003. New (and \nexisting) material failure laws for both thermo visco-elastic plastics and advanced \nmetals were investigated with special emphasis to accurately predict both initial \nmaterial failure and subsequent crack propagation. Crack propagation should be \naccurately represented in order to evaluate its effect on the structure integrity and \ncrashworthiness; for this two techniques using adaptive meshing and element \nsplitting have been studied. The work also accounted for changes in material \nmorphology that result from the manufacturing process; this will influence failure \nlimits for metal stamped parts due to the shaping operation. \n \n2 Constitutive modelling of failure and solution strategies  \nTwo different approaches are considered for material failure modelling. First, a \nmicro-mechanical approach using solid Finite Elements is used to provide a \n 4\nreasonably accurate prediction of the 3D stress distribution in the necking failure \nlocation and around a propagating crack. If suitably fine meshing and appropriate \nmaterial laws are selected then both failure initiation and crack propagation can be \nrepresented; clearly this approach leads to large FE models and is therefore \nrestricted to component failure analysis. The second approach is more practical for \nlarge scale crash analysis and uses conventional shell elements and macro-\nmechanical failure criteria to identify the onset of material failure. This law cannot \ntreat crack propagation and consequently element splitting and energy based criteria \nare applied for this phase of failure. The following sections briefly outline both \napproaches. \n \n2.1 Micro-mechanical models \nThe term \u2018micro- mechanical models\u2019 is used here to classify a modelling \napproach using detailed 3D solid elements which attempt to represent local necking, \nthe formation of a crack and crack propagation. During the course of the project \nphenomenological constitutive models with failure criteria based upon micro-\nmechanical void growth using the Gurson model [5] and the Gologanu model [6] \nwere developed, together with the Lemaitre mezzo-scale damage mechanics model \n[7] and the Wilkins failure criteria [8]; each of these models is briefly described below. \n \n2.1.1 The Gurson damage model \n 5\nIn recent years the Gurson constitutive model [5] has been widely used to treat \nprogressive microrupture of ductile metals. This model represents the commonly \nobserved stages of ductile fracture, which include: \n1) The formation of voids around inclusions and second phase particles. \n2) The growth of voids due to plastic straining and hydrostatic stress. \n3) The coalescence of growing voids leading to fracture. \n \nThese mechanisms are represented by introducing strain softening to the von \nMises elasto-plastic yield surface to treat damage growth. The nucleation rate of \nmicro-voids is expressed as a Gaussian distribution over plastic strains. The mean \neffective plastic strain \u03b5N, the nucleated microvoid volume fraction fN and standard \ndeviation of this Gaussian distribution SN are three Gurson parameters that must be \nfound. The growth is controlled by plastic strain and the hydrostatic state of stress. \nAdditional parameters must be given for initial void content f0, the critical microvoid \nvolume fraction at the onset of coalescence fC and the critical fraction of voids at \nwhich fracture occurs fF. Usually \u2018inverse engineering\u2019 techniques are used to \ndetermine the Gurson parameters by correlating test and analysis results for failure \nload and cross section dimension changes which occur at the neck of a tensile \ncoupon test.  \nThe Gurson model is a quadratic formulation of plastic potential which can \nalso be used as a yield function in which \u03c3eq is the macroscopic equivalent stress, \u03c3M \nis the elasto-viscoplastic flow stress, \u03c3m is the mean stress (= (\u03c311 +\u03c322 +\u03c333 ) \/3 ), q1 \n 6\nand q2 are two material constants and f* is the Tvergaard and Needleman effective \nvoid volume fraction [9], \n02\nM\n2\neq\nevp =\u2212= \u03d5\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c6 , \nwhere  \nM\nm\n2\n*\n1\n2*\n1 q2\n3       ,)cosh(fq2)fq(1 \u03c3\n\u03c3\u03bd\u03bd\u03d5 =\u2212+=   . \nThe microvoids volume fraction rate is expressed by, \nnucleationgrowth fff &&& += . \nwhere the growth of existing voids is given by, \nkkgrowth )f1(f \u03b5&& \u2212=  . \nand the void nucleation is controlled by the plastic strain and takes the form, \nM\n2\nN\nNM\nN\nN\nnucleation S2\n1exp\n2S\nff \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03c0 &\n&\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\u2212=   . \nThe effective void volume fraction f* is then defined by, \n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n>\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2264\ncc\ncF\nc\n1\nc\nc\n*\nf f    for     )ff(\nff\nf\nq\n1\nf  \nf f    for       f  \n  f  \nwhere fc and fF are two additional, previously defined, fitting parameters. \nThe main disadvantages of the model are determination of the Gurson \nparameters and, more importantly, that damage is only a consequence of hydrostatic \nloading. Damage and failure due to shear loading is not considered. Furthermore, \n 7\nstudies in the IMPACT project on tensile loaded notched specimens have found that \nthe optimal Gurson parameters vary with notch diameter; this would indicate that the \nGurson parameters are not a constant, but may be a function of the state of triaxial \nloading. \n \n2.1.2 The Gologanu damage model \nThe Gologanu model extends the Gurson model by taking into account the \nchanges in microvoid shape that occur during deformation. Indeed, the Gologanu \nmodel considers cavities of ellipsoidal form, whose shape and orientation can evolve. \nThe plastic potential is a quadratic formulation which can also be used as a yield \nfunction in which \u03c3 eq is the macroscopic equivalent stress, \u03c3M is the elasto-\nviscoplastic flow stress, q1, \u03b11 and\uf020 \u03b12 are material parameters introduced in order to \nconverge the model with full numerical analyses of periodic arrays of voids; f* is the \nTvergaard and Needleman's coalescence function, \n0\nX\nC 2\nM\nH\nevp =\u2212+\n\u2032= \u03d5\u03c3\n\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03c6  , \nwhere       ( ) 221112H\nM\nH*\n1\n2*\n1 )21(     ,     ),cosh(fq2fq1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03ba\u03c3\u03bd\u03bd\u03d5 +\u2212==\u2212+=  . \nThe parameters \u03ba,\uf020 \u03b7, C and X depend on the geometry of the ellipsoid void, \u03c3H is the \nmean stress and the von Mises norm is given by, \n          \n2\n3  ijijij \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 = . \n 8\nNumerically, in pure shear loading, there is no damage evolution and consequently \nno rupture. In order to consider damage due to shearing the damage evolution law is \nmodified to comprise of the sum of the classical law and a new part due to shear \nloading giving, \nshearnucleationgrowth ffff &&&& ++=  \nIn pure shear it is commonly accepted that the voids experience a rotation \nwithout any change in growth and it appears that nucleation can be generated. \nConsequently, the damage evolution law due to shearing takes the form of a \nstatistical law, similar to the nucleation evolution law, but taking into consideration the \nshearing strain and the shearing strain rate. It is defined by, \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2212\u2212= xy\n2\nS\nSxy\nS\nS\nshear S2\n1exp\n2S\nff \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03c0 &\n& . \nThe identification of the damage parameters controlled by the shearing strains \nis carried out by the inverse method using an Arcan type test [10]. Figure 1 shows \nthe tensile simulation of a non-axisymmetric double V-notched specimen; a) shows \nthe initial finite element modelling; b) and c) are the damage distribution at the end of \nthe process using the Gurson and Gologanu models respectively. Figure 1d gives the \norientation and shape evolution S at the end of the rupture process for an initial \nprolate void shape using the Gologanu model. From this Figure it can be seen that \nincluding changes in the void shape does allow anisotropic damage to be \nrepresented and more correctly captures the failure process. It should be noted, \nhowever, that the implementation here was only for shell element which limits \naccuracy since triaxial stresses, particularly in the necking zone, are neglected. A \n 9\nsolid element would lead to better results but would be CPU time consuming; a \nfurther improvement could be to use an energy criterion to dissipate energy as each \nfailed element is eliminated. \n \n2.1.3 The Lemaitre damage model \nThe framework of continuum damage mechanics is used to describe the \ndevelopment of damage under mechanical loadings, its progression up to the \ninitiation of a macro-crack and finally the growth of this macro-crack during failure of \nthe component. The original model for ductile fracture was established for isotropic \ndamage conditions and later extended to include anisotropic damage development \n[11,12]. The basic ingredient of the model is the damage law used either in \nmonotonic loadings for ductile fracture, or in cyclic loadings for low cycle or high cycle \nloadings. This damage law depends on the damage variable D and the strain energy \ndensity release rate which is the principal variable governing the phenomenon of \ndamage and is expressed by, \n D1\nWY e\u2212= . \nThe strain energy rate We is split into its shear and hydrostatic parts, and leads to the \nfollowing expression, \n \n( ) 2\nijijije )D1(E2)D1(E2\n1W \u03c3\u03bd\u03c3\u03c3\u03bd \u2212\u2212\u2212\n+= . \nin which ij ij ij ij ij if 0 and 0 if 0= \u2265 = <\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 . Finally, the damage evolution during \nplastic straining is defined by the following expression, \n 10\n D\n pp\nS\n   if    \nS\nYD \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5 >\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb= &&  , \nin which S and s are material coefficients, \u03b5 p is the effective plastic strain and \u03b5D is \nthe plastic strain at damage threshold. \nAs the damage evolution is localised in the large plastic strain zone the \nevolution damage law and the threshold parameters must be identified in \nconsequence. A direct identification approach or local approach is used essentially \non uniaxial monotonic and cyclic tests, Figure 2. For a better identification \nexperiments in the largest possible domains of stresses, strains, time and number of \ncycles are needed [7]. An identification approach using inverse techniques is used to \nfind the damage parameters by correlating experimental and numerical macroscopic \nmeasurement strongly dependent on the parameters [13,14]. Tensile tests on thin \nnotched specimens are used as mechanical tests to measure macroscopic \nresponses and variations of inner radius and force with respect to elongation of the \nspecimen are used to correlate test and numerical models. \nIn order to better represent the behaviour of an aluminium alloy, an anisotropic \npotential can be used [15,16,17]; for the present case, a Hill 48 potential is \nconsidered. The above damage model for anisotropic materials has been \nimplemented in 2D shell and 3D solid elements. The damage parameters were \nidentified as discussed above and applied to a validation example consisting of the \nthree points bending of an aluminium extruded section with an initial slit (starter \ncrack) on the lower face to localise failure initiation, Figure 3. This test was carried \n 11\nout dynamically and the numerical and experimental results are found to be in good \nagreement in terms of failure path and energy level, Figure 4. \n \n2.1.4 The Wilkins failure criteria \nAn early continuum model for void nucleation is due to Argon, Reference [18]. \nThis model proposes that the decohesion stress \u03c3c is a critical combination of the \nhydrostatic \u03c3m and the effective von Mises stress \u03c3e,  \n\u03c3c = \u03c3m + \u03c3e  . \nIn a similar approach Wilkins [8] proposed a failure criterion based of the \nsummation of the increment of plasticity, in this case two weighting functions, w1 and \nw2, are introduced to independently weight damage due to the hydrostatic and \ndeviatoric loading components. This law then defines cumulative damage (D) to be \ngiven by, \n \nD  =  \u222b 1w 2w d p\u03b5  \n \nwhere, d p\u03b5  is the equivalent plastic strain, \n1w  is the hydrostatic-pressure weighting term = \n\u03b1\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+ aP1\n1 , \n2w  is the deviatoric weighting term = ( )\u03b2A\u22122 , \nA  = Max ,\ns\ns,\ns\ns\n1\n2\n3\n2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n      321 sss \u2265\u2265 . \n 12\nThe hydrostatic stress is denoted P, and s1, s2 and s3 are the principle stress \ndeviators; the material constants a, \u221d and \u03b2 are found from experimental testing \nwhich should, ideally, cover a wide range of loading conditions ranging from pure \nhydrostatic to pure shear. Again, Finite Element solutions and \u2018inverse engineering\u2019 \ntechniques are used to correlate test and simulation results and determine \u2018best fit\u2019 \nvalues for the failure constants. \nWithin this work tensile parallel sided specimens and notched specimens \n(8mm, 4mm and 0.25mm diameter) are used to determine the model failure \nparameters. As a validation exercise the previous extruded aluminium example under \nthree point bending was studied. In this case a mesh of shell elements was used for \nmost of the section with only 3D solids being used around the area of failure, Figure \n5, in order to reduce CPU time. Figure 5 shows the comparison between experiment \nand simulation for impact force time histories and direction of crack propagation. In \ngeneral the results are encouraging and a good agreement is found; in this case the \ndifference between the Hill 48 and standard von Mises plasticity are not significant.  \nAn industrial application of the Wilkins failure model is shown in Figure 6, \nwhich considers the dynamic loading of an Aluminium space frame structure. The \nmode of loading is side impact using a 179mm diameter rigid post. The modelling \nused a hybrid approach in which most of the structure used simple shell elements \nwhich were locally refined in critical areas with detailed 3D solid element meshes at \nwhich the failure criteria was applied. The failure parameters for the Wilkins model \nwere obtained from tensile tests on notched specimens. Whilst this modelling \napproach is costly in terms of preparation and CPU time it does provide predictive \nresults and all of the main failure locations were correctly identified. Future work will \n 13\nconsider the automated methods introduced in section 3.2 which will have the \npotential to identify all possible failure locations and restrict mesh refinement only to \nthese zones. \n \n2.1.5 Comparison of the Micro- failure models \n The Gurson model can realistically represent failure provided the loading state \nused to determine the Gurson parameters is similar to the state of loading in the \nrupture zone of the structure and is predominantly hydrostatic. Improvements are \npossible using the Gologanu model to take into account anisotropic damage; \nhowever, this model introduces several additional parameters that are not easily \nidentified. The Lemaitre model appears to give encouraging results and uses a well \ndefined, if somewhat laborious cyclic testing procedure, to determine the model \ndamage parameters. Finally, the Wilkins failure model is easily understood and \nrelatively straightforward to calibrate against appropriate test coupons; consequently, \nit has been well received by industrial partners in the IMPACT project. \n \n2.2 Macro-mechanical models \nModern crash simulation models typically use element edge lengths of 5 to 15 \nmm. The previous micro- mechanical failure laws are unsuitable for such meshes and \nalternative methods must be sought. In the IMPACT project two different approaches \nwere developed and tested: \n1. Failure prediction based on the onset of local instability. \n2. Failure based on fracture curves. \n 14\nThe first approach has been applied to sheet metal components made of high \nstrength TRIP, complex phase and dual phase steels, whereas the second was used \nfor automotive plastics. Both are briefly described below.  \n \n2.2.1 Stability criteria for fracture \nFor sheet metal the onset of instability can be used as a fracture criterion. This \nloss of stability is analysed by considering biaxial tension on a rectangular element of \nthe sheet. Usually instability manifests itself by local thinning (necking) in a groove \nrunning perpendicular to the larger principal stress; an analytical solution to this \nstability problem is provided by Marciniak [19], Figure 7a. At the onset of instability \nthe local strains associated with this groove equal the global strains and can \ntherefore be used as a measure of failure strains in a shell element, Figure 7b. After \ninstability large local strains localize in the neck leading to a large difference between \nlocal and global strains, Figure 7c. \nIn the IMPACT project the CRACH algorithm [20] is used to determine \ninstability limits; this incorporates the following improvements to the original Marciniak \nmodel: \n\u2022 A refined model of the geometry of the localized neck area is used. \n\u2022 A refined material model with anisotropic hardening including the \n\u2018Bauschinger\u2019 effect. \n\u2022 Inclusion of parameters to account for process history effects such as \nsolution heat treatment and age hardening. \n \n 15\nIn practice the part to be considered for crash failure analysis must first be \nsimulated as a metal stamping problem. Information on the complete deformation \nhistory for each element is needed and stored during stamping; this is then mapped \nto the new crash mesh prior to the crash simulation. During the crash simulation \ninformation on critical elements is exchanged between the crash simulation model \nand the CRACH algorithm to provide a continuous update on the stability limits for \nthe elements. If a state of instability is reached the element is eliminated.  \nThe CRACH algorithm requires an extensive test program to characterise the \ndynamic failure of pre-strained material. Specimens were prepared with different pre-\nstrain conditions and then tested dynamically to failure. Most of this high strain rate \ntesting work used a conventional Hopkinson bar; however, for the case of bi-axial \nloading a new dynamic multi-axial \u2018bulge\u2019 rig has been developed that allows such \ndeformation to be applied to high strength thin-sheet specimens at elevated strain \nrates (>100\/s), Figure 8. Also shown in Figure 8 is an example of the failure of a 100 \nmm diameter TRIP steel specimen. \nThe side impact study, Figure 9, illustrates the principle of this approach. The \nside structure analysed and the loading setup for the experiment and simulation \nmodel are shown in Figures 9a and 9b. The simulation is performed with a detailed \nshell element model having an average edge length of about 5 mm. The prediction of \nfailure is based on the onset of instability as predicted by the CRACH algorithm. \nFigure 9c shows the test location of failure in the B pillar which is also observed in \nthe numerical analysis. \n \n 16\n2.2.2 Constitutive and failure model for plastics  \nTypical polymers used in automotive applications are ductile thermoplastics \nwhich are used for a wide variety of applications including interior trim. These \napplications must meet certain energy absorption requirements to minimise occupant \ninjury. For this work two commercial plastics were investigated: \n1. HIFAX CR 1171 G 2116 from Basell Polyolefins: This is a semicristalline \n\u2018filled\u2019 Polypropylene (PP) copolymer. \n2. BAYBLEND T65 792 from Bayer: This is an amorphous \u2018unfilled\u2019 \nPolycarbonate\/Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (PC-ABS) blend. \n \nClearly the mechanical behaviour of metals and plastics are very different; \nnever-the-less, it has been proposed that the elasto-plastic von Mises law is a \nreasonable basis to describe the non linear response of plastics, Reference [3]. The \nmain difficulty is to provide a hardening law that can correctly describe the rate and \ntemperature dependent behaviour of these materials. An example stress-strain \nresponse for HIFAX (Polypropylene) is shown in Figure 10. A simple law that \nreasonably characterises the form of the stress-strain curve for most plastics is the \nG\u2019Sell model [21], with four curve fitting parameters, \n( )[ ] ( )( )m0hw \/expexp1k 2 \u2022\u2022\u2212\u2212= \u03b5\u03b5\u03c3 \u03b5\u03b5 , \nwhere \u03c3 and \u03b5 are the effective stress and strain, k is a scaling factor, ( )[ ]\u03b5wexp1 \u2212\u2212  is \na visco-elastic term to describe the beginning of the stress-strain curve and \n2he \u03b5 controls strain hardening at large strains. Finally, ( )m\u2022\u2022 0\/ \u03b5\u03b5  expresses the strain \nrate sensitivity as a power law. The material constants k, w, h and m are determined \n 17\nfor different temperatures and linear interpolation is used for any other temperature \nstate. G\u2019Sell parameters for HIFAX and BAYBLEND were determined from \nexperimental testing and are given in Table 2. Strain rate effects are included by \ndetermining these factors for different rates of loading and using linear interpolation \nfor other strain rates. \nThe high sensitivity of these materials to thermal changes suggests that \ntemperature increase due to internal material deformation should also be included. \nThe adiabatic increase in temperature can be expressed by the simple relation,  \n\u03a1\u2206\u2206\u03a4 \u03b5\u2217= Q*c , \nwhere \u2206T is the temperature increment resulting from a plastic strain increment \u2206\u03b5p \nfor a material with heat capacity Q; c is a conversion constant usually assumed to be \n0.9. \nExperimental testing has also shown that failure in plastics is highly dependent \non rate of loading and temperature. Consequently, a simple temperature and rate \ndependent failure criteria based on maximum principle strain has been used. The \nrequired information is defined via a set of curves, Figure 11a, from which failure for \nany strain rate and temperature condition may be interpolated. Figure 11b shows the \napplication of the plastic constitutive law, with failure, for a constant rate and different \ntemperature conditions. The abrupt point of failure is clearly seen in these curves. \nAn example application of this model is the impact of a thermoplastic \n(BAYBLEND) honeycomb plate, Figure 12, which is used for energy absorption in the \nA-pillars of a vehicle. The honeycomb plate was impacted with a sphere at different \ntemperatures and with different velocities. Test and simulation results for the ductile \n 18\nimpact case at 85\u00b0C and the brittle impact case -35\u00b0C are shown in Figure 13. The \nconstitutive model and simple macro- failure criteria give a good prediction of the \nchanges in failure modes for both high and low temperature impact cases. The \nimpact force time histories are also in good agreement with test results. \n \n3 Numerical techniques  \nTwo special developments to facilitate application of the material models have \nbeen made. First, techniques to automatically convert single shell elements to a \npatch of fine solid elements have been developed. This provides an automated \nprocedure to locally apply micro- mechanical material models and limit CPU costs. In \nthe case of macro- material modelling techniques have been developed to treat crack \ngrowth by splitting elements and allowing crack propagation dependent on energy \nbased criteria. Both techniques are briefly illustrated. \n \n3.1 Remeshing: Shells to solids \nGenerally shell elements having an edge legth of 5-15mm are appropriate for \ncrash simulation. As mentioned previosly these elements are not suitable for micro- \nmechanical constitutive laws and detailed 3D solid elements must be used. The two \nelement types can be combined to reduce CPU costs by using coarse shell elements \nwith fine solid meshes only in areas of potential failure. Clearly a better approach is \nto automate this process and replace shell elements with solids elements only in \nareas that approach failure during the crash. Figure 14 shows the conversion of one \nshell element to a set of solids. For such a procedure the patch of solid elements of \nspecific size must be generated and all constitutive variables, including damage \n 19\nvariables, must be mapped from the shells to the solid elements. Special constraints \nare also introduced to tie existing shell and solid elements to the new solids. Figure \n14 shows the application of this technique to a simple example. \n \n3.2 Shell element splitting  \nThe macro-mechanical stability criterion presented in section 2.2.1 is only valid \nup to the point of fracture; thereafter the local stress distribution of a growing crack \ncannot be captured by the coarse shell model. This crack growth phenomenon can \nbe approximately treated by splitting elements, Figure 15. The algorithm collects \nelement information at nodal points and checks if the node belongs to a propagating \ncrack and must be considered for opening. The direction of crack opening is \nassumed to be normal to the direction of maximum principal strain; fictitious forces \ncontrol crack opening such that at full opening the Mode I fracture energy of the \nmaterial over the area represented is absorbed. \n \n4 Conclusion \nThe IMPACT project undertook an extensive program to test dynamically a \nrange of automotive materials, develop constitutive models and validate the failure \nmodelling of these materials on components. In total four different constitutive failure \nlaws for metals have been studied and evaluated which are suitable for micro-\nmechanical analysis. Furthermore, a new macro-mechanical constitutive and failure \nlaw for rate and temperature dependent plastics and a macro-mechanical failure law \nbased on instability fracture criteria for high strength steels have been developed and \n 20\nvalidated. Other novel developments have included automatic mesh refinement and \nshell element splitting techniques to treat crack propagation. The work has been \nvalidated on several industrially relevant demonstrators where a good agreement \nbetween test and simulation results for failure prediction has been found. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe enthusiastic support of the IMPACT project partners VW, BMW, AUDI, \nIDIADA, ALCAN, ESI Group, CCP, Magna Steyr, CRF and the Universities of Oxford, \nValenciennes and Cachan are gratefully appreciated.
