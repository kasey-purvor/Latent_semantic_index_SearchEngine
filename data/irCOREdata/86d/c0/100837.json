We prove measurable Livs\u02c7ic theorems for dynamical systems modelled by\nMarkov towers. Our regularity results apply to solutions of cohomological equations\nposed on He\u00b4non-like mappings and a wide variety of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems.\nWe consider both Ho\u00a8lder cocycles and cocycles with singularities of prescribed order.\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we study the regularity of solutions \u03c8 of the cohomological equation\n\u03d5 = (\u03c8 \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u22121 \u00b5-a.e. (1)\nwhere (T ,X,\u00b5) is a dynamical system and \u03d5 : X \u2192 G is a cocycle taking values in\na Lie group G. Measurable rigidity in this context means that a measurable solution \u03c8\nmust have a higher degree of regularity, in many contexts inheriting the regularity of \u03d5\nand\/or T . Such cohomological equations arise in different applications: they are used to\ndetermine whether certain observables have positive variance in the context of the Central\nLimit Theorem and related distributional theorems. In the context of group extensions,\nthey decide on (stable) ergodicity and weak-mixing of the system. In other contexts,\ncohomological equations play a role in the question of whether two dynamical systems\nare (Ho\u00a8lder or smoothly) conjugate to each other.\nFundamental work on the regularity of measurable solutions to cohomological\nequations was done by Livs\u02c7ic [24, 25] who established rigidity theorems for Abelian\ngroup extensions of Anosov systems with an absolutely continuous invariant measure.\nDynamical rigidity theorems are often called Livs\u02c7ic theorems in the literature because of\nthis. Parry and Pollicott [33], using a transfer operator approach, extended Livs\u02c7ic\u2019s results\nto prove Ho\u00a8lder regularity of coboundary and transfer functions for compact Lie group\nextensions of subshifts of finite type and hence, via Markov partitions, Axiom A systems.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1740 H. Bruin et al\nFurther generalizations for uniformly hyperbolic smooth systems are given in [28, 29, 34,\n38, 39]. In the Anosov setting de la Llave et al [13] proved a C\u221e version of Livs\u02c7ic\u2019s\ntheorem and also C\u221e dependence of solutions upon parameters.\nThere are only a few results on Livs\u02c7ic theorems for non-uniformly hyperbolic or\ndiscontinuous systems. Pollicott and Yuri [35] have established Livs\u02c7ic theorems for Ho\u00a8lder\nR-extensions of \u03b2-transformations (f : [0, 1) \u2212\u2192 [0, 1), f (x) = \u03b2x (mod 1) where\n\u03b2 > 1) via transfer operator techniques but the regularity they obtain is bounded variation\nrather than Ho\u00a8lder. Jenkinson [18] has proved that essentially bounded measurable\ncoboundaries \u03c8 (i.e. solutions to \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u2212 \u03c8) for R-valued smooth cocycles \u03d5 over\nsmooth expanding maps f have smooth versions.\nNicol and Scott [30] have obtained Livs\u02c7ic theorems for certain discontinuous hyperbolic\nsystems, showing that coboundary solutions taking values in Lie groups satisfying a\npinching condition (to ensure that the system is partially hyperbolic) are Lipschitz if\nthe cocycle is Lipschitz. The same techniques show that, for such systems, measurable\ntransfer functions taking values in compact matrix groups have Lipschitz versions.\nThese results were applied to prove stable ergodicity for semisimple and Abelian compact\ngroup extensions of certain uniformly hyperbolic systems with singularities, including the\n\u03b2-transformation, Markov maps and mixing Lasota\u2013Yorke maps.\nAaronson and Denker [1, Corollary 2.3] have shown that if (f,X,\u00b5,P) is a mixing\nGibbs\u2013Markov map preserving a probability measure \u00b5 with countable Markov partition\nP and \u03d5 : X \u2192 Rd is Lipschitz (i.e. d(\u03d5(x), \u03d5(y)) < C\u03c1(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 f (a), a \u2208 P\nfor metrics d on Rd and \u03c1 on X derived from the symbolic dynamics) then any measurable\nsolution \u03c8 : X \u2192 Rd to \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u2212 \u03c8 has a version \u03d5\u02dc which is Lipschitz continuous.\nIn [2] there is a study of the statistical properties of fibred systems and rigidity\nresults are given which provide checkable conditions for the aperiodicity of cocycles (i.e.\nnon-existence of solutions \u03c8) which allow one to establish, for example, de Moivre\u2019s\napproximation for various systems, including the \u03b2-transformation. A related result is\ngiven in [14, Lemma 6.1.2].\nIn two influential papers [41, 42], Young describes properties of a class of Markov\nextensions (which we call Young towers) which are useful to establish rates of decay of\ncorrelations and the CLT in non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. Scott [36, 37] has recently\nproved measurable Livs\u02c7ic theorems for certain Lie group valued Ho\u00a8lder cocycles over a\nclass of unimodal maps modelled by a Young tower [41]. More precisely suppose that\n(f,X,\u00b5) (X a finite collection of intervals) is a unimodal map (belonging to a certain class)\nand g : X \u2192 G is a Lie group valued Ho\u00a8lder cocycle (satisfying a pinching condition if G\nis non-compact). If \u03c8 is a measurable solution to g = (\u03c8 \u25e6f )\u03c8\u22121 \u00b5-a.e. then \u03c8 is Ho\u00a8lder\non an arbitrarily large open set (i.e. given \u03b5 > 0 there exists an open set U such that \u03c8 is\nHo\u00a8lder on U and \u00b5(U) > 1 \u2212 \u03b5). Similar measurable Livs\u02c7ic theorems for other types of\ncohomological equations are given.\nThis paper extends the results of Scott in several directions. We prove measurable\nLivs\u02c7ic theorems for more general Markov extensions and for cocycles with singularities\nof prescribed order. We also obtain regularity results for measurable conjugacies between\ncertain non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and measurable Livs\u02c7ic theorems for certain\nnon-uniformly hyperbolic systems (in particular He\u00b4non-like mappings).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nLivs\u02c7ic regularity for Markov systems 1741\nAfter writing this paper we learnt that Goue\u00a8zel [16] has obtained similar results for\ncocycles into Abelian groups over one-dimensional Gibbs\u2013Markov systems and Young\ntowers. From [16] we learnt of a Martingale Density Theorem (see Appendix A) which\nallows a more elegant approach in part of our proof than the argument using Lebesgue\ndensity points adapted from [30].\n2. Cohomological equations and group extensions\nIn this section we collect some facts about group extensions and cohomological equations\nthat set the framework of this paper. All Lie groups are assumed connected and finite-\ndimensional.\nSuppose that f : X \u2192 X is an ergodic dynamical system with respect to an invariant\nmeasure \u00b5. Let G be a compact Lie group and let dh denote Haar measure on G.\nSuppose \u03d5 : X \u2192 G is measurable.\nPROPOSITION 1. [23, 31]\n(1) The compact group extension T (x, g) = (f (x), \u03d5(x)g) is ergodic with respect to\n\u00b5 \u00d7 dh if and only if the equation\n\u03c8(f x) = R(\u03d5(x))\u03c8(x) \u00b5-a.e. (2)\nwhere R is an irreducible (unitary) representation of degree d and \u03c8 : X \u2212\u2192 Cd is\nmeasurable, is only satisfied when \u03c8 is constant or R is the trivial representation.\n(2) Suppose f : X \u2192 X is weak-mixing and T : X \u00d7 G \u2192 X \u00d7 G is ergodic.\nThen T (x, g) = (f (x), \u03d5(x)g) is weak-mixing with respect to \u00b5 \u00d7 dh if and only\nif for any ei\u03b1 \u0006= 1 and any non-trivial one-dimensional representation \u03c7 of G the\nequation\n\u03c8(f x) = ei\u03b1\u03c7(\u03d5(x))\u03c8(x) \u00b5-a.e. (3)\nhas no non-trivial measurable solution \u03c8 : X \u2192 C.\nNote that the aperiodicity condition of [2]\n\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03d5 = \u03bb\u03c8\/\u03c8 \u25e6 f\nwhere \u03b3 is a character of G (a locally compact Abelian polish group), \u03bb \u2208 S1 is a special\ncase of (3).\nSuppose that \u03d5i : X \u2192 G, i = 1, 2 are two compact Lie-group valued cocycles over\na system (f,X,\u00b5). A measurable function \u03c8 : X \u2192 G conjugates the G extensions\nT (x, g) = (f x, \u03d5i(x)g) (i = 1, 2) if\n\u03c8(f x)\u03d51(x) = \u03d52(x)\u03c8(x) \u00b5-a.e. (4)\nWe call such a conjugating function \u03c8 a transfer function.\nIf G is compact we may identify G with a subgroup of U(d), the group of d \u00d7 d\nunitary matrices. In this representation we may identify a G-valued \u03d5 : X \u2192 G with\n\u03d5 : X \u2192 Cd2 . Define \u03b8(x) : M(d) \u2192 M(d), a mapping from the space of d \u00d7 d complex\nmatrices to itself by\n\u03b8(x) : A \u2192 \u03d52(x)A\u03d51(x)\u2217.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1742 H. Bruin et al\nIt is possible to show that \u03b8(x) : M(d) \u2192 M(d) is unitary. There is a standard way,\nsee [33, Theorem 1] and [18, Theorem A], to rewrite \u03c8(f x)\u03d51(x) = \u03d52(x)\u03c8(x) in the\nform \u03c8(f x) = \u03b8(x)\u03c8(x) where \u03c8 : X \u2192 Cd2 , \u03b8(x) \u2208 U(d). Hence, the question of the\nregularity of conjugacies between compact group extensions may be reduced to those of\nthe regularity of solutions to (2).\nThe proof of our coboundary Livs\u02c7ic regularity results, such as Theorem 1, may be\nslightly modified (as in [30, \u00a72.1]), to establish the same degree of regularity for solutions\n\u03c8 to (2), (3) or (4) posed over the same dynamical system. We omit the straightforward\nproof of this and refer the reader to [30, \u00a72.1].\n2.1. Lie groups. Let G be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra denoted by L(G)\nwhich we identify with the tangent space at the identity, TeG. We let rg denote right\nmultiplication by g \u2208 G. Given a norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 on TeG we define a norm on TgG\nby \u2016v\u2016g = \u2016rg\u22121v\u2016e. This norm induces a right invariant metric dG on G so that\ndG(gk, hk) = dG(g, h), see [34, \u00a74]. Throughout this paper we will write d(\u00b7, \u00b7) instead of\ndG(\u00b7, \u00b7) when it is clear from context that we mean the metric on G. For a general reference\non Lie groups, see [7].\nWe define the adjoint map Ad : G \u2192 Aut(L(G)), for g \u2208 G and X \u2208 TeG by\nAd(g)v = d\ndt\n(g exp(tv)g\u22121) at t = 0.\nNote that when G is a matrix group this action is conjugation, i.e. v \u2192 gvg\u22121.\nA calculation [34, \u00a74] shows that\nd(gh, gk) \u2264 \u2016Ad (g)\u2016d(h, k). (5)\nSuppose that \u03d5 : M \u2192 G is Ho\u00a8lder of exponent \u03b1 > 0. Define\n\u00b5u := lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n(\nsup\nx\u2208X\n\u2016Ad (\u03d5n(x))\u2016\n)1\/n\n,\nwhere \u03d5n(x) = \u03d5(f n\u22121x) . . . \u03d5(f x)\u03d5(x).\nIf G is Abelian or compact, then supx \u2016Ad (\u03d5n(x))\u2016 is bounded in n, whereas if G is\nnilpotent, supx \u2016Ad (\u03d5n(x))\u2016 can grow at most at a polynomial rate. In these three cases,\n\u00b5u = 1.\n3.

We state the following result.\nTHEOREM 2. Assume that (M, f,\u00b5) is a measure-preserving smooth Markov system as\ndefined in \u00a73, and Mk \u2208 P0. Let \u03d5 : M \u2192 G be a Lie group valued observable which has\na singularity set C \u2282 M \\\u22c3k Mk , characterized by cases (1), (2) or (3) above. Let \u03c8 be a\n\u00b5-measurable solution of the cohomological equation\n\u03c8 \u25e6 f (x) = \u03d5(x)\u03c8(x) \u00b5-a.e.\nThen there is a version \u03c8\u02dc of \u03c8 , with \u03c8\u02dc = \u03c8 \u00b5-a.e. such that \u03c8\u02dc is \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder on Mk , for\nsome \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nRemark 3. The condition that C \u2282 M \\\u22c3k Mk is unnecessarily strong, but is shared by\nmany examples. For multimodal maps and Lorenz maps on the interval, induced maps F\nto a neighborhood Y of the critical point c are common constructions [9]. The interval Y\nhas the decomposition Y = \u22c3i Yi mod \u00b5 where F |Yi = f ri : Yi \u2192 Y is monotone onto\nfor an appropriate ri > 0. For each i, f j (Yi) \u0006\n c for 0 \u2264 j < ri . Hence, if \u03d5 has only\nsingularities at c, then using the above theorem and by the argument of Corollary 1, we can\nconclude that \u03c8 has a Ho\u00a8lder version on Y .\nRemark 4. Also in cases where C \u2282 M \\\u22c3k Mk fails, the proof below can still be used\nto get partial results. Given an element Mk the proof constructs an N and a component J\n(where f N(J ) = Mk) of the preimage f\u2212N(Mk) such that \u03c8 has a Ho\u00a8lder version on J .\nIf J can be chosen such that f i(J ) \u2229 C = \u2205 for 0 \u2264 i < N , then there is a version of \u03c8\nwhich is Ho\u00a8lder on Mk . If this condition is not satisfied then using the proof of Corollary 1\nit is possible to show that for any \u03b5 > 0, Mk contains an open set U \u2282 Mk , \u00b5(Mk \\U) < \u03b5,\nand \u03c8 has a version which is Ho\u00a8lder on U .\nRemark 5. The dependence of \u03b1 on the exponent \u03b3 , the asymptotics of the sequence \u03b5n,\nand the type of singularity are apparent from the proof.\nRemark 6. The same regularity is forced upon solutions \u03c8 to (2), (3) or (4).\nProof.

We have to check that there are\nsufficiently many backward paths that avoid passing too close to the singularity. We do\nthis by using a Borel\u2013Cantelli argument.

The same result holds for solutions \u03c8 to (2), (3) or (4).\nProof. First observe that \u00b5 is an ergodic f -invariant measure.

Suppose that (T ,X) is modelled by a Young tower (M, f,\u00b5) over base\n\u000b \u2282 X, satisfying (18). Assume that log+ \u2016Df \u22121\u2016 \u2208 L1(\u00b5) or that (19) holds. Let \u03bd be\nthe T invariant ergodic pulled back measure, as in (17). Let \u03d5\u02dc : X \u2192 G be \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder\nand satisfy \u00b5u < \u03bb\u03b1\/R0 . Then for any 0 \u2264 k \u2264 Rj , any \u03bd-measurable solution to the\ncohomological equation \u03d5\u02dc = (\u03c8\u02dc \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u02dc\u22121 has a version which is Ho\u00a8lder on T k(\u000bj ).\nProof. Suppose that \u03d5\u02dc : X \u2192 G is Ho\u00a8lder and \u03d5\u02dc = (\u03c8\u02dc \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u02dc\u22121, \u03bd-a.e. Let \u03c0 : M \u2192 X\nbe defined as \u03c0((x, i)) = T i(x), so that T \u25e6 \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 f . Then \u03d5\u02dc, \u03c8\u02dc : X \u2192 G lift to the\ntower as \u03d5 = \u03d5\u02dc \u25e6 \u03c0 , \u03c8 = \u03c8\u02dc \u25e6 \u03c0 and satisfy \u03d5 = (\u03c8 \u25e6 f )\u03c8\u22121, \u00b5-a.e. Moreover, \u03d5 is\n\u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder with respect to the metric \u03c11. Since derivatives Df (f i(x)) on the tower agree\nwith derivatives DT(T i(x)) on (X, T ),\n(\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nn\u22121\u220f\ni=0\nDf (f i(x))\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n)1\/n\n\u2265 \u03bb\u03b1\/R0 > \u00b5u\nfor \u00b5-a.e. x, verifying (PH) on (M, f,\u00b5).\nNow Theorem 3 gives \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder (with respect to \u03c11) solution \u03c8 \u2032 to the cohomological\nequation \u03d5 = (\u03c8 \u2032 \u25e6 T )\u03c8 \u2032\u22121, such that \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 \u00b5-a.e. Since \u03c8 \u2032 takes the same value on\nevery point of \u03c0\u22121(x) for \u03bd-a.e. x the projection \u03c8\u02dc \u2032 = \u03c8 \u25e6\u03c0 is well defined, \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder and\nsatisfies \u03d5\u02dc = (\u03c8\u02dc \u2032 \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u02dc \u2032\u22121, \u03bd-a.e. \u0001\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1754 H.

For metric \u03c12, however, the projection\n\u03c0 : M \u2192 X, (x, i) \u0012\u2192 T i(x) need not preserve the Ho\u00a8lderness of solutions of the\ncohomologous equation on (M, f ). If the projection \u03c0 preserves continuity or is only\nused on the base \u000b, this may still suffice for applications.\n5.2. The Manneville\u2013Pomeau family. In the previous results, the assumptions that \u00b5 is\nfinite and\/or has positive Lyapunov exponents can be weakened for some group extensions.\nFor the Manneville\u2013Pomeau family the Jacobian J\u00b5 of \u00b5 is Ho\u00a8lder, i.e. there exists C\nand \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1] such that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223J\u00b5(x)J\u00b5(y) \u2212 1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C \u00b7 \u03c1(f (x), f (y))\u03b3 . (22)\nTo prove Lemma 1, assumption (6) can be weakened to\u2211\nn\u22650\n\u03c1(yn, zn)\n\u03b3 < K(x\u02c6)\u03c1(y0, z0)\n\u03b3 , (23)\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 is the Ho\u00a8lder exponent in (8). In this case \u03bb(\u00b5) can be 0, and (PH) fails, but\nif G is Abelian or compact, or if G is nilpotent with a dominated growth rate so that for\ninverse branches \u2211\nn\u22650\n\u2016Ad (\u03d5n(y0))\u2016d(\u03d5(yn+1), \u03d5(xn+1))\u03b1 < \u221e, (24)\nthen the estimates (9) hold. Furthermore, the pulled back measure \u03bd can be at most \u03c3 -finite\nif (18) fails. According to (21), this implies that \u03bb(\u00b5) \u2264 1.\nThis scenario is found in the well-known Manneville\u2013Pomeau maps. This is a family of\nmaps on [0, 1] which have a neutral fixed point (where we take \u03c1 to be Euclidean distance),\nparameterized by parameter p \u2208 (0,\u221e). For p \u2265 1 these maps admit a \u03c3 -finite absolutely\ncontinuous invariant measure. However, the measure is not a probability measure, and the\nmap has zero Lyapunov exponents for Lebesgue almost all initial conditions. We have\nthe following regularity result in this setting.\nTHEOREM 4. Consider the Manneville\u2013Pomeau map (for p \u2265 0):\nT (x) =\n{\nx + 2px1+p if x \u2208 [0, 12 ),\n2x \u2212 1 if x \u2208 [ 12 , 1].\nIf G is an Abelian or compact group and \u03d5\u02dc : [0, 1]\u2192G is a G-valued \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder\nobservable for \u03b1 > p\/(1 + p), then any Lebesgue measurable solution to the\ncohomological equation \u03d5 = (\u03c8 \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u22121 has a version which is \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder on [0, 1].\nRemark 12. The same regularity is forced upon solutions \u03c8 to (2), (3) or (4).\nProof. For p \u2208 [0, 1), T has an invariant probability \u03bd \u0013 Leb, whereas \u03bd is only \u03c3 -finite\nif p \u2265 1. However, the first return map F to [ 12 , 1] has always an invariant probability \u00b5 \u0013\nLeb, and Fn has bounded distortion, independently of n. Therefore, we can use Theorem 3\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nLivs\u02c7ic regularity for Markov systems 1755\nprovided we can show that \u03d5|(\u000bj , i) = \u03d5\u02dc \u25e6\u03c0\u22121|\u000bj = \u03d5 \u25e6T i |\u000bj is Ho\u00a8lder. This is done as\nfollows. It is not hard to check that T \u2212n( 12 ) = 12 (pn)\u22121\/p+o(n\u22121\/p), where T \u2212n indicates\nthe nth inverse of the left branch of T . Consequently, diam(T \u2212n(J )) = O(n\u2212(1+p)\/p).\nEven if \u03bd is \u03c3 -finite, \u03bd([ 12 , 1]) < \u221e. Therefore, the subset M\u02c60 := {x\u02c6 \u2208 M\u02c6 : x0 \u2208 [ 12 , 1]}\nhas finite \u00b5\u02c6-measure. Suppose that x\u02c6 \u2208 M\u02c60 is a backward orbit (chosen as in Theorem 1),\nand y\u02c6, z\u02c6 \u2208 M are such that yn, zn \u2208 Pn[xn] for each n. Let n0 = 0 and nk = min{n >\nnk\u22121 : xn \u2208 \u000b = [ 12 , 1]}. Since |DF| \u2265 2, \u03c1(ynk , znk ) \u2264 2\u2212k and, hence, using the fact\nthat \u03b1 > p\/(1 + p),\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nd(\u03d5(yn), \u03d5(zn)) \u2264\n\u2211\nk\u22650\nnk+1\u22121\u2211\nn=nk\nO(1)\u03c1(yn, zn)\u03b1\n\u2264\n\u2211\nk\u22650\n\u03c1(y0, z0)\n\u03b12\u2212\u03b1k\nnk+1\u2212nk\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nO(1) diam(T \u2212n([ 12 , 1]))\u03b1\n\u2264 \u03c1(y0, z0)\u03b1\n\u2211\nk\u22650\n2\u2212\u03b1k\nnk+1\u2212nk\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nO(1)n\u2212\u03b1(1+p)\/p\n\u2264 O(1)\u03c1(y0, z0)\u03b1.\nThis calculation replaces (9) in the proof of Theorem 1. Continuing the proof as in\nTheorem 1, we get that \u03c8 has an \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder version on [ 12 , 1]. As T : [ 12 , 1] \u2192 [0, 1]\nis smooth by using the cohomological equation \u03c8 \u25e6 T (x) = \u03d5(x) \u00b7 \u03c8(x), it follows that \u03c8\nhas an \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder version on [0, 1], cf. Corollary 1. \u0001\nRemark 13. The arguments above can also be used to establish Ho\u00a8lder regularity for\nnilpotent groups G, provided that (24) holds. Having \u00b5u = 1 alone is not enough\nto establish Livs\u02c7ic regularity, but if \u2016Ad (\u03d5n(y0))\u2016 grows at a rate \u2018dominated\u2019 by the\npolynomial contraction of d(\u03d5(yn+1), \u03d5(xn+1))\u03b1, which in our case is O(n\u2212\u03b1(1+p)\/p),\nthen the conclusion of Theorem 4 will remain valid.\n5.3. Interval maps with critical points. So far, the Markov systems used in the examples\nwere Young towers, even though we allowed a \u03c3 -finite measure for the Manneville\u2013\nPomeau map. Theorem 1 also applies to different kinds of Markov systems. In this section\nwe discuss the consequences of the theory to systems modelled by so-called Hofbauer\ntowers. The metric \u03c1 is Euclidean distance in this section.\nAn interval map T : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] is called piecewise continuous (piecewise Cr )\nif there exists a finite set of points 0 = a0 < a1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ak\u22121 < ak = 1 such that\nT |(ai\u22121, ai) has a continuous (Cr ) extension to [ai\u22121, ai]. We call a0, . . . , ak the critical\npoints of T and denote this set by C. Let P1 denote the partition {[a0, a1], . . . , [ak\u22121, ak]}\nand let Pn = \u2228n\u22121i=0 T \u2212i (P1) be the partition into n-cylinders. For x \u2208 I \\\u22c3n\u22121i=0 T \u2212i (C),\nlet Pn[x] denote the n-cylinder containing x.\nDue to the presence of critical points, T \u22121 need not be differentiable at boundary points\nof T (P ), P \u2208 P1, and hence boundedness of distortion (i.e. condition (14)) cannot be\nrealized globally. For this reason, we call J a core interval if it is compactly contained\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1756 H. Bruin et al\nin T n(P ) for some n \u2265 1 and P \u2208 Pn. For example, if T (x) = 1 \u2212 ax2 is a non-\nrenormalizable unimodal map, then any interval compactly contained in [T 2(0), T (0)] is a\ncore interval.\nTHEOREM 5. Let T be a piecewise C3 interval map onto the unit interval with\nnegative Schwarzian derivative. Let \u03bd be a T -invariant probability measure such that\u222b\nlog |T \u2032|d\u03bd > 0. Assume that the Jacobian J\u03bd is Ho\u00a8lder or \u03bd \u0013 Leb. Let \u03d5 be a\nLie group valued piecewise \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder observable, with discontinuities (if any) only at the\npoints ai , and satisfying the partial hyperbolicity condition (PH). If \u03d5 = (\u03c8 \u25e6 T )\u03c8\u22121 for\nsome \u03bd-measurable function, then for every core interval J with \u03bd(J ) > 0, \u03c8|J has an\n\u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder version.\nRemark 14. Assume that the core interval J is compactly contained in T n(P ) for\nsome P \u2208 Pn, and n \u2265 1. Although the Ho\u00a8lder exponent is independent of J ,\nthe Ho\u00a8lder coefficient in the Ho\u00a8lder property of the Ho\u00a8lder version of \u03c8|J depends\non min{diam(J )\/ diam(L), diam(J )\/ diam(R)}, where L and R are the components of\nT n(P ) \\ J . As this minimum tends to 0, the Ho\u00a8lder coefficient tends to infinity.\nRemark 15. The assumption that T is onto is not a severe restriction. Since \u03bd is assumed\nto have a positive Lyapunov exponent, \u03bd cannot be supported on a non-repelling periodic\norbit, so\n\u22c2\nj T\nj ([0, 1]) is a non-trivial interval. For the same reason, \u03bd cannot be supported\non a wandering interval, i.e. an interval W such that T n(W)\n\u22c2\nT m(W) = \u2205 for all\nn \u0006= m \u2265 0. By restricting and rescaling, we can assume that T : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] is\nonto.\nRemark 16. The same result holds for solutions \u03c8 to (2), (3) or (4).\nProof. We construct a Markov system, introduced by Hofbauer [17] as the canonical\nMarkov extension and sometimes called a Hofbauer tower. This is the system (M, f ),\nwhere M is a disjoint union of closed intervals. We call B = [0, 1] the base of the tower.\nThen\nM = B\n\u2294(\u2294\nn\u22651\n\u2294\nP\u2208Pn\nT n(P )\n)\/\n\u223c\nwhere the sets T n(P ) \u223c T n\u2032(P \u2032) if they are the same interval. Let \u03c0 : M \u2192 [0, 1] be\nthe natural projection. The action f is defined on M as follows. If x \u2208 M belongs to the\ncomponent D, then\nf (x) = \u03c0\u22121(T (\u03c0(x))) \u2229 D\u02dc,\nwhere component D\u02dc := T (D \u2229 P1[\u03c0(x)]) is again a component of M . Obviously (M, f )\nis Markov and T \u25e6 \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 f . Due to the Markov property, the following holds for any\ncomponent D of M:\nT n(Pn[x]) = \u03c0(D) if and only if f n(\u03c0\u22121(x) \u2229 B) \u2208 D.\nIf \u03bd is T -invariant, then we can construct a measure \u00b5 as follows. Let \u00b50 be the measure\n\u03bd lifted to the level B and set \u00b5n = (1\/(n + 1))\u2211ni=0 \u00b50 \u25e6 f\u2212i . Clearly \u03bd = \u00b5n \u25e6 \u03c0\u22121\nfor each n. As shown in [22], \u00b5n converges vaguely. We call the limit measure \u00b5. If \u03bd\nis ergodic, then \u00b5 is either a probability measure on M , in which case we call \u00b5 liftable,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nLivs\u02c7ic regularity for Markov systems 1757\nor it is identically 0 on M . In this case the mass \u2018has escaped to infinity\u2019. Keller\u2019s result\n[22, Theorem 3] states if \u222b log |T \u2032| d\u03bd > 0, then \u03bd is liftable to an invariant measure \u00b5 on\nthe Markov extension. Moreover, \u00b5 is ergodic if \u03bd is.\nIf J is a core interval and \u03bd(J ) > 0, then there is some level D \u2208 M compactly\ncontaining a lifted copy J\u02dc := D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(J ), and \u00b5(J\u02dc ) > 0. Let \u03b4 > 0 be such that D\ncontains a \u03b4|J |-neighbourhood of J\u02dc . Using negative Schwarzian derivative and the Koebe\nprinciple, see [27], we find that for every x \u2208 M with f n(x) \u2208 J\u02dc , that f n has bounded\ndistortion on the component of f\u2212n(J\u02dc ) containing x. In fact, the distortion depends only\non \u03b4.\nFinally, we will show that \u03c8|J has a Ho\u00a8lder version. \u03d5\u02dc = \u03d5 \u25e6 \u03c0 is an observable on\nthe Markov extension. The coboundary \u03c8 lifts to a coboundary \u03c8\u02dc = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c0 . Therefore,\nwe can apply Theorem 1 to it to find a version of \u03c8\u02dc that is \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder. Projecting it back to\nthe interval, we find the desired \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder version of \u03c8 . (Note that since \u03c8\u02dc takes the same\nvalue on every point in \u03c0\u22121(x), we find that the Ho\u00a8lder version of \u03c8 does not depend on\nthe level D \u2208 M that we lift J to.) \u0001\nLet T : I \u2192 I be a C3 S-multimodal map having critical set C. Assume each critical\npoint c \u2208 C has order \u0015c, 1 < \u0015c < \u221e. We assume for simplicity that T is locally\neventually onto, i.e. for every non-degenerate subinterval U \u2282 I , T n(U) = I for some\nn \u2265 0. This excludes that g is renormalizable, or has a non-expanding periodic orbit.\n(Also wandering intervals are excluded, but this is already a corollary of the smoothness,\nsee [27].) In this case the T -invariant measure \u03bd that we will be considering is supported\non I .\nTHEOREM 6. Assume that T : I \u2192 I is C3 multimodal with negative Schwarzian\nderivative and non-flat critical points. Write cn = T n(c) and \u0015max = max{\u0015c : c \u2208 C}.\nAssume that T satisfies the summability condition\u2211\nc\u2208C\n\u2211\nk\u22651\n|DTk\u22121(c1)|\u22121\/\u0015max < \u221e, (25)\nand hence possesses an acip \u03bd (cf. [10, 32]). Let \u03d5 be a piecewise \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder L1(\u03bd)\nobservable, with discontinuities of types (1)\u2013(3) of \u00a73.1, at critical points only. If \u03d5 =\n\u03c8 \u25e6 T \u2212 \u03c8 for some \u03bd-measurable function, then for every core interval J , \u03c8|J is \u03b1\u02dc-\nHo\u00a8lder for any \u03b1\u02dc \u2208 (0, \u03b1).\nProof. Assume as above that T is locally eventually onto. We build a Markov extension\n(M, f ) as in Theorem 5. Since T admits an acip \u03bd (with necessarily positive Lyapunov\nexponent, cf. [21] and also [8]), it can be lifted to an acip \u00b5 on (M, f ). Let D be any level\nin M that compactly contains a lifted copy J\u02dc = D \u2229 \u03c0\u22121(J ) of J and such that \u03bd(J ) > 0.\nLet (M\u02c6, f\u02c6 , \u00b5\u02c6) be the natural extension of (M, f,\u00b5). By the Koebe principle, we have a\nuniform distortion bound for f n|Pn[xn] \u2229 f\u2212n(J ) for each x \u2208 J\u02dc (i.e. J is a core interval\nas introduced before).\nThe next thing to check is that there are sufficiently many backward paths that avoid\npassing close to the singularities of \u03d5 at C. This argument is similar to that in the proof of\nTheorem 2. The proof that (I, f ) has an acip was given in the multimodal case in [10],\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1758 H. Bruin et al\nbased on the well-known result of Nowicki and van Strien [32]. An important estimate in\n[10] is that for some C = C(T ) < \u221e,\n\u03bd(A) \u2264 C \u00b7 Leb(A)1\/\u0015 for all measurable A \u2282 I.\nIt follows that if Bn = (c \u2212 n\u22122\u0015, c + n\u22122\u0015), then\n\u03bd(Bn) \u2264 C \u00b7 Leb(Bn)1\/\u0015 \u2264 2C\nn2\n,\nand hence, lifted to the tower\n\u00b5(T \u2212n(J\u02dc ) \u2229 Bn) \u2264 \u03bd(Bn) \u2264 2C\nn2\n.\nIt follows from the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma that for \u00b5\u02c6-a.e. x\u02c6 \u2208 M\u02c6, there exists N = N(x\u00af)\nsuch that xn \/\u2208 Bn for all n \u2265 N . From now on, the argument is the same as in\nTheorem 2. \u0001\nIn view of questions raised in, e.g., [11], we are particularly interested in the potential\n\u03d5 := \u222b\nI\nlog |T \u2032| d\u00b5 \u2212 log |T \u2032|. This potential is smooth, except for logarithmic\nsingularities at the critical points. Theorem 6 shows that any \u03bd-measurable solution of\nthe cohomological equation \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u25e6 T has a version which is \u03b1-Ho\u00a8lder for any\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) on each interval that is compactly contained in [c2, c1]. We can apply it to the\nquadratic family fa(x) = 1 \u2212 ax2. It is known that for Leb-a.e. a \u2208 [0, 2], fa has either\nan attracting periodic orbit, or has a positive Lyapunov exponent at the critical value, and\nboth parameter sets have positive measure. Below we make a weaker assumption on the\ngrowth rate of derivatives along the critical orbit.\nCOROLLARY 3. Let f : I \u2192 I be a C3 S-unimodal map with critical order \u0015 < \u221e,\nsatisfying the summability condition \u2211n |Df n(c1)|\u22121\/\u0015 < \u221e (and hence possessing an\nacip \u03bd). Then \u03d5 = log |f \u2032| \u2212 \u222b log |f \u2032| d\u03bd can only be a measurable coboundary if there\nexists a periodic interval J \u2286 I of period k such that c \u2208 J and J = [f 2k(c), f k(c)].\nProof. First assume that f is non-renormalizable. In this case, \u03c8 is Ho\u00a8lder continuous and\nhence bounded on any interval compactly contained in [c2, c1]. Since \u03d5 is bounded except\nat c, we easily derive that \u03c8 has to be unbounded at every forward image of the critical\npoint. This is only possible if\n\u22c3\nn\u22651 f n(c) \u2282 {c1, c2}.\nNext assume that f is finitely renormalizable, say J \n c is a periodic interval, f k(J ) \u2282\nJ , f k(\u2202J ) \u2282 \u2202J where k \u2265 2 is the period of renormalization, and f k|J is unimodal\nand non-renormalizable. Then the above argument shows that\n\u22c3\nn\u22651 f n(c) \u2229 J \u25e6 = \u2205.\nTherefore, J = [f 2k(c), f k(c)], and f k|J is conjugate to x \u0012\u2192 1 \u2212 2x2. \u0001\nIn the context of parametrized S-unimodal families fa , the conclusion of this corollary\nis that under the summability condition\n\u2211\nn |Df n(c1)|\u22121\/\u0015 < \u221e, \u03d5 is not a measurable\ncoboundary except, possibly, for countably many parameter values. If fa is infinitely\nrenormalizable, then the summability condition fails. If fa is finitely renormalizable, then\nequivalently, there is a smallest periodic interval J \n c with f k(J ) \u2282 J . Only when the\nrenormalized map f k : J \u2192 J is conjugate to the full unimodal map x \u0012\u2192 1 \u2212 2x2 (and\nfor each k \u2265 1 and configuration of J, f (J ), . . . , f k\u22121(J ), this usually holds for only\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nLivs\u02c7ic regularity for Markov systems 1759\none parameter), then it is possible that \u03d5 is a measurable coboundary. However, even in\nthis situation, it seems extremely unlikely that \u03d5 is a measurable coboundary as it requires\nthat the multipliers of all periodic orbits are the same.\nExample. If f (x) = 1 \u2212 ax2 is the quadratic map, then \u03d5 = log |f \u2032| \u2212 \u222b log |f \u2032| d\u03bd is a\nmeasurable coboundary for a = 2, but not for the parameter a \u2248 1.543 689 01 at which f\nis renormalizable of period 2, and f 3(c) is the orientation reversing fixed point.\nProof. For a = 2, then f is a Chebychev polynomial, and hence h(x) = \u2212 cos 2x\nconjugates T with the tent map T (x) = min{2x, 2(1 \u2212 x)}: h \u25e6 T = f \u25e6 h. It follows that\n\u03d5 = log |f \u2032| \u2212 log 2 = \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u25e6 f for \u03c8 = \u2212log|h\u2032 \u25e6 h\u22121|.\nNext assume that f has a k-periodic interval J as in the proof of Corollary 3, such\nthat F := f k|J is conjugate to x \u0012\u2192 1 \u2212 2x2. Applying the cohomological equation\nto F , we get log |F \u2032| \u2212 k \u222b log |f \u2032| d\u03bd = \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u25e6 F . If h : [0, 1] \u2192 J is defined by\n\u03c8 = \u2212 log |h\u2032 \u25e6 h\u22121|, then F \u25e6 h = h \u25e6 T for the tent map T as above. In particular,\nk\n\u222b\nlog |f \u2032| d\u00b5 = log 2. By the cohomological equation, each periodic point y \u2208 J \u25e6 must\nhave multiplier log 2.\nFor k = 2, F |J has an orientation reversing fixed point q1, and {q1, q2 := f (q1)} is\nthe corresponding period 2 orbit under f . We find log |F \u2032(q1)| = log |f \u2032(q1) \u00b7 f \u2032(q2)| =\nlog 4|1 \u2212 a|. So log |F \u2032(q1)| = log 2 only if a = 12 or 32 , but neither parameter value\ncorresponds to the required renormalizable map. \u0001\n6. Livs\u02c7ic theorems for non-uniformly hyperbolic systems\nIn this section we use Young towers [41, 42] to prove measurable Livs\u02c7ic theorems for\nLie group valued cocycles over non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. In particular we are\nable to prove Livs\u02c7ic theorems for He\u00b4non maps [5]. These maps take the form f (x, y) =\n(1\u2212ax2 +y, bx), with a \u0016 2 and b \u0016 0, where for a positive Lebesgue measure subset of\nparameter space (a, b), it is proved that these maps admit a non-trivial attracting set with\nan ergodic Sinai\u2013Ruelle\u2013Bowen measure supported on it, see [12]. A Markov extension\ncan be associated with such maps, as we describe below. Our results are also applicable to\nother non-uniformly hyperbolic systems which can be shown to admit a Young tower; see,\nfor example, [3, 15, 40].\nWe discuss diffeomorphisms for which there exists a stable foliation. For the non-\nuniformly expanding case drop all references to the stable foliation. We refer to Young\n[41, 42] and Baladi [4] for more details. In a non-uniformly hyperbolic system the unstable\nleaves are not invariant under the return map to a reference set and this introduces some\ncomplications to the analysis. The proof in this section is based on that of Theorem 3 and\nCorollary 2.\nIn this section we use the notation that is commonly used for Young towers.

Define\nT R(x) = T R(x)(x).\nWe have \u0018 := {(x, l) : x \u2208 \u000b; l = 0, 1, . . . , R(x) \u2212 1} where \u00180 = {(x, 0) : x \u2208\n\u000b} = \u000b in a natural identification. Define F : \u0018 \u2192 \u0018 as\nF(x, i) =\n{\n(x, i + 1) if x \u2208 \u000bj and i < Rj \u2212 1,\n(T Rj x, 0) if x \u2208 \u000bj and i = Rj \u2212 1.\nThere is a projection \u03c0 : \u0018 \u2192 X given by \u03c0(x, i) = T i(x) and \u03c0 \u25e6F = T \u25e6\u03c0 . The tower\n(F,\u0018) is then reduced to an expanding map F\u00af R : \u0018\u00af0 \u2212\u2192 \u0018\u00af0, where \u0018\u00af0 is the quotient of\n\u00180 under the equivalence relation that two points are equivalent if and only if they belong\nto the same local stable leaf \u03b3 s .\nWe need the following properties.\n(A1) There exists an F -invariant probability measure \u03bd with conditional measures {\u03bd\u03b3 } on\n\u03b3 u \u2229\u000b leaves with densities {\u03c1\u03b3 } with respect to m\u03b3 , which satisfy 1\/C \u2264 \u03c1\u03b3 \u2264 C\nfor some C > 0 (see [42, \u00a72]).

Partition\n\u000b in such a way that if A \u2282 B, A \u2208 Qi , B \u2208 Pi then \u03b3 u \u2229 B = \u03b3 u \u2229 A for each \u03b3 u for\neach \u03b3 u such that \u03b3 u \u2229 A \u0006= \u2205.\nThe \u03c3 -algebra generated by\n\u2228\ni Qi generates the Borel \u03c3 -algebra on \u000b. By the\nMartingale Density Theorem, given \u03b7 > 0 there exists n and an element of the partition\ncomponent An \u2208 Qn so that for some x \u2208 An\n\u03bd{y \u2208 An : d(\u03c8(x), \u03c8(y)) < \u03b7}\n\u03bd(An)\n> 1 \u2212 \u03b7.\nFor x \u2208 An define \u03c4n = R(x) + R(T Rx) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + R((T R)n\u22121x) and note that T \u03c4n(x) =\n(T R)nx. Given x0 \u2208 \u000b, x\u03c4n \u2208 An with T \u03c4nx\u03c4n = x0 define xi by T \u03c4n\u2212ix\u03c4n = xi . By (A1)\nand (A4) we may choose a portion of leaf \u03b3n = \u03b3 u \u2229 An and x\u03c4n such that\nm\u03b3n{y \u2208 \u03b3n \u2229 An : d(\u03c8(x\u03c4n), \u03c8(y)) < \u03b7}\nm\u03b3n(\u03b3n)\n> 1 \u2212O(\u03b7).\nThen \u03b3\u02dcn := (T R)n\u03b3n is an unstable leaf which crosses \u000b completely in the unstable\ndirection. As a consequence of (A3)\nm\u03b3\u02dcn{y0 \u2208 \u03b3\u02dcn : d(\u03c8(x\u03c4n), \u03c8(y\u03c4n)) < \u03b7}\nm\u03b3\u02dcn(\u03b3\u02dcn)\n> 1 \u2212O(\u03b7). (27)\nOn \u03b3\u02dcn define a function \u000fn : \u03b3\u02dcn \u2212\u2192 G by\n\u000fn(y0) = \u03d5\u03c4n(y\u03c4n)[\u03d5\u03c4n(x\u03c4n)]\u22121,\nwhere \u03d5i(xj ) = \u03d5(xj\u2212i+1) . . . \u03d5(xi+j ) and \u03d50(x) = e.\nTake points z0, w0 \u2208 \u03b3\u02dcn.

(28)\nRecall that \u03c8 restricted to each stable leaf in \u000b is uniformly Ho\u00a8lder. The holonomy map\nalong stable leaves is absolutely continuous (A4) and the density of \u03bd with respect to\nLebesgue is bounded away from zero and above by (A1). Hence [19, Proposition 19.1.1]\nimplies that\n\u03bd{(x, y) \u2208 \u000b \u00d7 \u000b : d(\u03c8(x), \u03c8(y)) < C\u02dc\u03c1X(x, y)\u03b1}\n\u03bd \u00d7 \u03bd(\u000b \u00d7 \u000b) > 1 \u2212O(\u03b7).

Appendix\nSuppose that \u03c8 : X \u2192 G is a measurable function from a metric measure space into a\nconnected finite-dimensional matrix Lie group G endowed with a right invariant metric\ndG. Let \u03c0i,j : G \u2192 R, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2d be the local coordinate chart functions. The proof of\nthe proposition below clearly generalizes to any finite number of real-valued measurable\nfunctions and hence establishes the Martingale Convergence Theorem, since continuity is\na local property.\nPROPOSITION 2. Suppose that (X,\u00b5) is a probability space and {Pn} is an increasing\nsequence of partitions of X and let Pn[x] denote the partition element of Pn which\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1764 H. Bruin et al\ncontains x \u2208 X. Suppose the Borel \u03c3 -algebra is generated by \u2228n Pn. Let \u03d5 : X \u2192 R be\n\u00b5-measurable and \u03b7 > 0. For \u00b5-a.e. x \u2208 X,\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u00b5{y \u2208 Pn[x] : d(\u03d5(x), \u03d5(y)) < \u03b7}\n\u00b5(Pn) > 1 \u2212 \u03b7. (30)\nProof. First suppose that \u03d5 \u2208 L1(\u00b5). Let Fn denote the \u03c3 -algebra generated by the\npartition Pn. Then\nlim\nn\u2192\u221eE[\u03d5|Fn](x) = \u03d5(x), \u00b5-a.e.\nby [6, Corollary 5.22]. Note that E[\u03d5|Fn](x) is constant on Pn. Choose a sequence {\u03b4i}\nsuch that\n\u2211\ni \u03b4i < \u221e. Given \u03b4i > 0 take Ni sufficiently large that d(E[\u03d5|Fn](x), \u03d5(x)) <\n\u03b7 except for a set of measure at most \u03b4i\u03b72 for all n \u2265 Ni . For all Ni , the union Ui of the\nset of atoms A \u2208 PNi for which\n\u00b5{y \u2208 A : d(E[\u03d5|FNi ](y), \u03d5(y)) > \u03b7}\n\u00b5(A)\n> \u03b7,\nsatisfies \u00b5(Ui) < \u03b72\u03b4i . By the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma, \u00b5-a.e. x \u2208 X lies in only finitely\nmany Ui . Finally to remove the assumption that \u03d5 is integrable note that given \u03b5 > 0 there\nexists an integrable function \u03c8 such that \u03c8(x) = \u03d5(x) except for a set of measure at most\n\u03b5. An argument using approximating functions and the Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma gives the\nsame result for measurable \u03d5. \u0001\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. Aaronson and M. Denker.
