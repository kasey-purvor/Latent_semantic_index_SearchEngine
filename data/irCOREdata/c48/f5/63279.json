This flexibility enables the quantification and prediction of forest 2 and 3-D 29 \nstructural variables owing to deterministic, mechanistic and\/or stochastic algorithms 30 \nsimulating the processes affecting growth. However, their practical value has often 31 \nbeen limited owing to (a) their extensive data requirement and (b) their complexity 32 \nand the difficulty in quantifying parameters and model output uncertainty (e.g. 33 \nGertner et al. 1999).  34 \n 35 \nRemote sensing technology is increasingly exploited for forest inventorying and 36 \nmonitoring (e.g. Baulies and Pons 1995, Hyypp\u00e4 et al. 2000) as it can provide insights 37 \ninto the spatial and temporal variability of forests, information which is seldom 38 \navailable from ground surveys alone. While it is a generally accepted premise that 39 \nfield data provide the closest representation of reality, spatially resolved ground based 40 \ndata can be time consuming, expensive and logistically difficult to acquire where 41 \naccess to forested land is limited. Comparatively, highly resolved remote sensing data 42 \ncan be obtained at relatively low costs. Additionally, novel approaches now supply 43 \nestimates of forest structural variables of accuracy equivalent if not superior to 44 \ntraditional measurements techniques (e.g. Magnussen and Boudewyn 1998, Hyypp\u00e4 et 45 \nal. 2001).  Remote sensing may therefore help meet forest ecophysiologists and 46 \nmodellers\u2019 data requirements.  47 \n 48 \nPage 2 of 41\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/tres   Email: IJRS-Administrator@Dundee.ac.uk\nInternational Journal of Remote Sensing\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n3\nIn this context, we present Bayesian calibration (BC) as a means to integrate remotely 49 \nacquired datasets into ecological models. This approach offers a number of 50 \nadvantages in comparison with goodness-of-fit and optimisation approaches. In 51 \naddition to facilitating the integration of data of varying degree of uncertainty, BC 52 \nenables the quantification of uncertainty associated with parameters and model 53 \noutputs, an important requirement for practical applications of models (Green et al. 54 \n2000).  Parameters and data used in the calibration process are presented in the form 55 \nof probability distributions, reflecting our degree of certainty about them (Jansen 56 \n1999).  Bayesian calibration enables the updating of distributions as further 57 \ninformation is gained. The framework thereby targets the much-needed platform for 58 \n(i) integrating datasets of varying degree of certainty and (ii) expressing parameter 59 \nand output uncertainty in forest-growth modelling (Green et al. 2000, Ghazoul & 60 \nMcAllister 2003, Van Oijen et al. 2005).   61 \n 62 \nIn this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by calibrating the 3-PG 63 \nmodel (Physiological Processes Predicting Growth, Landsberg & Waring 1997, Sands 64 \n& Landsberg 2002) for UK Corsican pine stands (Pinus nigra car. maritima (AIT.) 65 \nMelv.). 3-PG is built on a combination of process-based calculations, several key 66 \nsimplifying assumptions and few empirical relationships. The model predicts gross 67 \nand net primary production as well as biomass allocation to different pools. Over the 68 \nyears, it has been increasingly and successfully been applied to new species 69 \nworldwide (Landsberg & Waring 1997, Law et al. 2000, Waring 2000, Coops & 70 \nWaring 2001, Coops et al. 2001, Sands & Landsberg 2002, Almeida et al. 2004, Stape 71 \net al. 2004). However, the parameterisation of the model for new species remains a 72 \nchallenge.

In this context, the aim of this paper is to 75 \nillustrate the potential of BC as a means to (i) calibrate models for novel species (ii) 76 \nintegrate multi-source datasets and (iii) quantify model parameters and outputs along 77 \nwith uncertainty.  78 \n 79 \nOur paper is structured as follow. In section two, we present an overview of the 3-PG 80 \nprincipal submodels. Section three provides a description of the field site, available 81 \nremote sensing and field based datasets for model initialisation, parameterisation and 82 \ncalibration. The processing of the databases is also briefly summarised. Section four 83 \ncontains the description of the Bayesian calibration and finally, results and 84 \ndiscussions are presented in section five and six, respectively. 85 \n 86 \n2 Structure of the 3-PG model 87 \nThe 3-PG model has monthly or annual time steps and entails five state variables \u201388 \nfoliage, stem and root biomass, stocking density and available soil water \u2013 in 89 \nconjunction with five submodels \u2013biomass production; biomass allocation; soil water 90 \navailability and evapotranspiration; mortality; and inventory variables. The required 91 \nclimatic data are monthly average values of solar radiation (MJ m-2 d-1), atmospheric 92 \nwater pressure deficit (mbar), mean air temperature (\u00b0C), rainfall (mm month-1) and 93 \nfrost days. Other input variables include site latitude, an estimate of soil fertility, 94 \nmaximum available soil water (mm per depth of rooting zone, in meters) and a 95 \ngeneral description of soil texture. 3-PG outputs considered in this study were leaf 96 \narea index (LAI, projected), above ground biomass (ABG biomass, t ha-1), stem 97 \nbiomass (t ha-1), foliage biomass (t ha-1), root biomass (t ha-1) and stem height (m).  98 \nPage 4 of 41\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/tres   Email: IJRS-Administrator@Dundee.ac.uk\nInternational Journal of Remote Sensing\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n5\n2.1 Biomass production 99 \nThe biomass submodel converts solar radiation into dry matter. The interception of 100 \nradiation is defined by Beer\u2019s law and canopy LAI. The amount of photosynthetically 101 \nactive radiation intercepted by a stand (\u00f8pa, mol MJ-1) is then converted into 102 \ncarbohydrates by means of a canopy quantum efficiency coefficient (\u0010cx, mol mol-1)103 \nand a conversion factor converting carbohydrates into dry matter. Further constraints 104 \non assimilation are then applied by dimensionless environmental factors varying 105 \nbetween 0 and 1 (1 indicates optimal conditions). These factors, also referred to as 106 \nmodifiers, are multiplicative and represent the influence of vapour pressure deficit (D)107 \nor soil moisture, which ever is most limiting, mean air temperature (T), frost, and soil 108 \nnutrition on photosynthetic assimilation (Sands 2004). Gross primary productivity 109 \n(Pg, t ha-1 d-1) is then converted to net primary productivity (Pn, t ha-1 d-1) using a 110 \nsimple Pn \/ Pg ratio (Y).111 \n 2.2 Biomass allocation and mortality 112 \nPn is then allocated to the different plant components (roots, foliage and stems 113 \nincluding branches) at each time step. Allocation to roots is proportional to the 114 \nharshness of the environment. It is influenced by site fertility, stand age and the most 115 \nlimiting between D or soil water, but does not fall below or exceed set values of 116 \nminimum and maximum allocation to roots. The remaining Pn is shared between 117 \nstems and foliage through a foliage-to-stem allocation ratio, given by an allometric 118 \nrelationship with mean diameter at breast height (Sands & Landsberg 2002, Sands 119 \n2004). DBH is itself obtained from an allometric relationship with stem biomass. 120 \nWhereas Pn partitioning parameters must generally be estimated from fitting methods, 121 \nthose pertaining to the allometric relationship between stem biomass and diameter can 122 \nbe derived from forest mensuration (Sands & Landsberg 2002). Mortality is applied 123 \nPage 5 of 41\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/tres   Email: IJRS-Administrator@Dundee.ac.uk\nInternational Journal of Remote Sensing\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n6\nthrough the self thinning 3\/2 law, which sets an upper limit to the mean single-tree 124 \nstem mass at a given stocking level. 125 \n 2.3 Soil water balance  126 \nAvailable soil water \u0016 (mm month-1) is governed by rainfall interception by the 127 \ncanopy (iR), rainfall (RP, mm month-1) and evapotranspiration (ET, mm month-1). If the 128 \nmaximum available water at saturation is exceeded, the excess of water is lost as 129 \nrunoff.  130 \n TPR ERi \u0001\u0001= )1(\u0003 [1] 131 \nRainfall interception increases with canopy LAI and is taken as a fraction of rainfall. 132 \nET is calculated using the Penman Monteith equation controlled by the canopy 133 \nconductance, solar radiation and D. Canopy conductance (gC, m s-1) increases with 134 \nLAI but is bounded by the LAI value at which conductance is at a maximum (gCx, m s-135 \n1). The relationship between gC and LAI is further controlled by age and the most 136 \nlimiting factor controlling stomatal aperture, either vapor pressure deficit or soil 137 \nmoisture.  Further details on 3-PG can be found in Landsberg and Waring (1997) and 138 \nSands and Landsberg (2002). 139 \n 140 \n3 Materials and methods 141 \n3.1 Study site and available datasets 142 \nThe calibration of the 3-PG model was conducted for Corsican Pine stands of yield 143 \nclass 14 using existing data from a 20,000 ha forest plantation, East Anglia, UK 144 \n(Thetford forest, 52\u00b030\u00b4 N, 0\u00b030\u00b4 E).

Figure 4 shows an example of MCMC trace plot and the 399 \nresulting marginal posterior distribution for the fertility rating (FR) parameter.  400 \nFigure 4 401 \nSummary statistics to the marginal distributions of parameters are presented in Table 402 \n3, which include the mean and standard deviation and the vector of highest a403 \nposteriori probability density (\u0016MAP). Figure 5 shows the mean model outputs from the 404 \n25,000 estimates, the 3-PG outputs from \u0016MAP (best fit) and the datasets used in the 405 \nlikelihood. 406 \nTable 3 407 \nFigure 5 408 \n 409 \nPartial correlations between parameters and outputs are presented in Figure 6. These 410 \nare illustrated under the form of a colour fingerprint between the 14 calibrated 411 \nparameters and the 28 model outputs. High negative correlations are shown as dark 412 \nblue and high positive correlations, as dark red. Light regions indicate weak or no 413 \ncorrelation.   414 \nFigure 6 415 \n 416 \n 417 \nIn Table 3, one can observe the close similarity between the \u0016MAP vector and the 418 \nposterior mean )(i\u0003 , suggesting that both vectors converge towards a single solution 419 \n(a local maximum within the full posterior distribution).  Corresponding model 420 \noutputs are shown in Figure 5. Outputs from \u0016MAP  (best fit) and )(i\u0003 (posterior mean) 421 \nalso lie closely to data error bounds. Note the smaller error bounds to the posterior in 422 \ncomparison with the data.

This appears to be an 425 \nartefact of the model structure, rather than parameterisation. Additional MCMC 426 \nanalysis was conducted (results not shown here) to explore the influence of the model 427 \nstructure on the model outputs. The data used in the calibration were given here 428 \nextremely high standard deviations, such that the distributions tended towards 429 \nuniform. Likewise, large but realistic ranges of parameter values (with uniform 430 \ndistributions) were given.  In doing so, the data became uninformative and the 431 \nobserved dynamics in the model outputs resulted predominantly from the model 432 \nstructure therefore representing \u201ca typical behaviour\u201d and dynamic of the model.  In 433 \naverage, the model will tend to produce certain results, unless specific 434 \nparameterisation is provided.  The results showed that in average, 3-PG simulates 435 \nabove-ground growth in an increasing, near linear fashion; LAI follows an 436 \nexponential increase along the rotation without tail off; and root allocation increases 437 \nearly in the rotation but decreases thereafter (in a similar dynamic as that observed in 438 \nFigure 5). This suggests that comparatively to above ground biomass and LAI, whose 439 \ndynamics are sensitive to parameterisation, root biomass is predominantly determined 440 \nby the model structure. In the Bayesian calibration conducted here, even when data 441 \nwith small uncertainties are used, the underlying influence of the model structure is 442 \nevident. 443 \n 444 \nCareful examination of Figure 6 also provides strong insights into the multivariate 445 \ninteractions imbedded in the model.  For instance, one can observe consistent 446 \ncorrelation throughout the rotation between parameters and specific outputs. The 447 \noptimum temperature for growth, Topt is consistently negatively correlated with all 448 \nmodel outputs considered. As Topt increases, productivity is reduced.

The species is endemic to elevated 450 \naltitude Mediterranean regions where hot days are four times more frequent than in 451 \nLowland Britain (Brown 1960, Kerr 2000). However, the stands in Thetford seldom 452 \ngrow under optimal temperature where annually, the average temperature is 453 \napproximately 10\u00b0 C.  Similarly, as the maximum canopy quantum efficiency 454 \nincreases (\u000fCx), a consistent increase in all biomass outputs is observed. An expected 455 \nresult, as the net primary production is proportional to the product of the maximum 456 \ncanopy quantum efficiency (\u000fCx), the Pn \/ Pg ratio (Y), light interception and 457 \nenvironmental constraints. Other consistent correlations are found between specific 458 \nleaf area (\u00101), litterfall rate (\u0012F1), the ratio of foliage to stem partitioning at maturity 459 \n(p20) and LAI;  between the fertility rating (FR) and above ground components 460 \n(biomass and LAI); or root turnover (\u0012R) and root biomass. As for decreasing or 461 \nincreasing correlations with outputs throughout the rotation, these can provide 462 \nindications as to where the influence of a parameter is most significant. With 463 \nBayesian calibration, the inverse is also true: data collected at specific moments 464 \nduring the rotation may be particularly useful in calibrating and reducing the 465 \nuncertainty for a given parameter. For instance, maximum stand age (tx) plays an 466 \nimportant role late in the rotation, as it controls productivity reduction as stand ages.  467 \n 468 \nThe results presented above serve three purposes. Firstly, they present a first attempt 469 \nto parameterise 3-PG for Corsican pine stands. While occupying more than 30 470 \nthousand hectares of the UK territory (Forestry Commission, 2001), relatively limited 471 \ninformation is available on Corsican pines, comparatively to more economically 472 \nviable species such as Sitka spruce and Scots pine.  Thetford forest, one of the largest 473 \nUK plantations, served as a case study.

Secondly, we illustrated the 476 \nability of Bayesian calibration as a framework to integrate remote sensing datasets, 477 \noften the only source of data available at the spatial and temporal scales required, into 478 \necological modelling. This approach enables uncertainty analysis despite the fact that 479 \nlimited data (and often of poor quality), is available.  With Bayesian calibration, given 480 \nrelatively diffuse priors (e.g. uniform distributions), the posteriors will be at first 481 \nstrongly influenced by the data. This influence however decreases as new data come 482 \nin and as the uncertainty in the prior decreases. Thirdly, despite the fact that the 483 \nprobability density of a scalar model output or parameter is nearly nil, process based 484 \nmodels used in forestry are commonly parameterised by adjusting the value of 485 \nselected parameters for the model output to fit the data time series, without any 486 \nindication of parameter and output uncertainties. The parameterisation of 3-PG for 487 \nnovel species is unfortunately no exception (e.g. White et al. 2000, Sands and 488 \nLandsberg 2002, Sands 2004, Stape et al. 2004 and Almeida et al. 2004). The results 489 \npresented here have shown that given ever increasing computing power and speed, 490 \nuncertainty quantification and model parameterisation can be achieved with relative 491 \nease using Bayesian calibration.   492 \n 493 \n6 Conclusion 494 \nWhile both optimisation and Bayesian approaches address the need to test whether a 495 \nmodel can predict available data or not, in optimisation, parameter values are adjusted 496 \nsuch that the model yields outputs closest to the data. This precludes the integration of 497 \nuncertain datasets, ancillary or remotely sensed, which can provide information on 498 \nvariables not currently or commonly compiled. Additionally, approaches such as the 499 \nPage 20 of 41\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/tres   Email: IJRS-Administrator@Dundee.ac.uk\nInternational Journal of Remote Sensing\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n21\nmaximum-likelihood do not enable the full exploration of the parameter landscape. 500 \nThe resulting parameter vector may therefore only be from a local maximum. 501 \nConversely, Bayesian calibration advocates the quantification of uncertainties to 502 \nparameters, thereby yielding uncertainties in model outputs, over the derivation of an 503 \noptimised set of parameter based on a goodness-of-fit approach (e.g. the maximum-504 \nlikelihood approach).  By doing so, Bayesian calibration provides a means to conduct 505 \ntruly integrative work for quantifying model output and parameter uncertainty, while 506 \nconsidering all the existing information, including that enclosed in the model itself. 507 \n 508 \nAcknowledgements 509 \nThe authors would like to thank Maurizio Mencuccini (University of Edinburgh), 510 \nDavid Cameron (CEH Edinburgh), Richard Waring (Oregon State University), and 511 \nPeter Savill (University of Oxford) for sharing data and advices.
