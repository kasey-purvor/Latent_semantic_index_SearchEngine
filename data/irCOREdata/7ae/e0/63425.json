A desktop computer is a good starting point. Word \nprocessing can be seen as a route from tangled thought to immaculate presentation. \nSpreadsheets can help to build, analyze and plot datasets. Data can be collected with \nforms and spreadsheets, with on-line instruments in the laboratory or in the field, or \nby scanning and maybe OCR. Standards are needed to communicate between \nsystems.  \n \nKey Words - Desktop computer, word processing, spreadsheets, data capture. \n \n \n1. The route to IT familiarization \n \nNot all geoscientists are familiar with available methods of IT, although these \ninfluence all phases of a project and every type of information. This review looks for \nunderlying principles, looking at individual support in this part, moving on to project, \nthen global requirements (Parts D - H). It tracks the process of familiarization, from \nubiquitous tasks like word processing through statistical analysis, spatial analysis and \ncomputer visualization to the management of databases and repositories. \n \nYou learn about computers by using them, just as you get to know a town by living in \nit. A guidebook can help by pointing out features you might otherwise miss, and \nexplaining the background to improve your understanding and give an overview to tie \nit all together. I see no reason to repeat sections of computing manuals here, when you \ncan readily find the real thing, often as online help and demonstrations of software on \nyour computer. Instead, I offer suggestions about what to do and where to find things \n- a means to an end, not an end in itself.  \n \nThis guidebook also has a theme: that information technology is changing the way we \nconduct geoscience, and to control that change we need to understand, not just the \ntechnology but also the way our science works. As I am unsure of what you already \nknow, I start with basic concepts, and hope you will skip ahead if they offer nothing \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nnew. A search of the World Wide Web will provide details of many of the topics \nmentioned. \n \nMany geoscientists have a good basic knowledge of computing, and add to it as \nrequired. The advantage of learning by experience is that the information may be \nmore relevant and so more easily remembered. The disadvantage is that broader \nissues may be forgotten and better methods neglected in favor of the familiar, but \nperiodic review of similar applications elsewhere helps to overcome bad habits. \nFormal instruction through books and courses should lead to a wider appreciation of \nthe possibilities, and to learning the best approach rather than one that was stumbled \non by accident. \n \nThose who are less familiar with the basics of IT or its geoscience applications have \ndifferent priorities. They need to gain the basic skills of operating with keyboard and \nmouse. They must learn how simple tasks are handled on the computer before they \nare in a position to learn about more complex applications, where these skills are \ntaken for granted. A step-by-step approach where skills are learned and immediately \nput to good use is strongly recommended. Word processing is one skill which is at \nonce useful and also leads to familiarity with the keyboard, mouse and screen, and the \nidiosyncrasies of the graphical user interface (GUI). Handling electronic mail (e-\nmail), on-line public access catalogs (OPACs), and surfing the Web are then less \ndaunting.  \n \n2. Desktop hardware \n \nA good starting point for learning about computing applications is your own desktop \ncomputer, where skills can be learned by experiment, making mistakes in the privacy \nof your own office. Here is a place to learn of the user interface, word processing, \nspreadsheets, database and communication features. Desktop computers also support \nmany small geoscience applications that are helpful in individual investigations. \n \nThe computer screen on the desktop is a window into information technology. It may \nbe part of a personal computer or a workstation or a simple network computer with \nlittle computing capacity of its own, but with the ability to download instructions from \na remote server. It may be static or portable. It may be for your exclusive use or it \nmay be one of many machines which get their individuality from downloaded \nsoftware. Thus you may be able to go to one of many different computers, enter your \nidentifier and password and operate it as your own machine. \n \nIf you would be seen as technically aware, you would know the make and model of \nyour desktop machine and its main server, if any. You would know the name of its \noperating system and the company that produced it. You would know whether the \ncomputer is free-standing, that is, unconnected to others, or networked. If the latter, \nyou would know what type of network it is connected to and by what means, how \nextensive the network is, and the bandwidth of the connection. The protocols for \ngraphics on screen, the memory size, the processor speed, the disk capacity, and any \nperipheral attachments including the printing facilities (type, manufacturer, resolution, \ncolor availability, paper sizes), are additional points of interest. Some computing \nterms are reviewed in E. The details for your own machine can usually be discovered \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nby searching through the menus on the machine, by looking at the manuals, or by \nasking a well-informed colleague. \n \nMost of us have little say in selecting a computer at work. If we do, the important \npoints are likely to be how it fits in with existing equipment and planned \ndevelopments. At home, other considerations come into play, but compatibility with \none\u2019s employers' plans may still be crucial. For mainstream, general-purpose \ncomputers, you should be able, as when renting an automobile, to get in and drive, \nassuming, of course, some training and experience. If you plan to select and buy your \nown personal computer, there are many periodicals that offer advice. The vendors are \nlikely to be biased, and it is well to precede any discussions with them with a little \nbackground research and to have in mind some figures for the details mentioned in the \nlast paragraph. There is no point in offering further advice on purchase here, as it \nwould be long out-of-date before publication. Remember, however, that a computer \nsoon becomes obsolete, and the cost of purchase may have to be written off over as \nlittle as three years. Remember also that the main costs will lie in training and upkeep \nrather than the initial purchase. \n \nFaced with an unfamiliar machine, progress can be made with a combination of \nexperimentation, reading books and manuals, on-line help systems and \ndemonstrations, advice from colleagues and vendors, and from training courses if they \nare readily available. Skills should be learned with a purpose in view, not studied and \nforgotten. An obvious starting point in computer use is word processing. \n \n3. Word processors \n \nWord processing skills are not difficult to acquire, and are a vital part of most \ngeoscientists' work.  Furthermore, the skills are fundamental to most other computer \napplications, and few of the present readers should be without them.  A very small \nnumber of word processor packages dominate the market, all with similar features, \nand all suited to a geoscientist's needs.  A choice between them might depend on the \navailability of local support, cost, their integration with other relevant packages, and \nperhaps the ease of handling mathematical or chemical formulas. They should be seen \nas part of the overall computing facility, not as a self-contained item. \n \nThere is no point in offering advice on their usage here, as this is best obtained from \ntheir on-line tutorials or manuals. However, we need to review their function, to see \nhow it contributes to the information system. Think first of the earlier alternatives, \nwhich have shaped the information system as we know it. A familiar analogy is \nwriting with pen and paper, starting at the top of the page and writing line by line until \nthe page is full. Corrections can be made by striking out unwanted text and adding \nmore wherever space is available. As the hand-written document can become rather \nillegible, the next step is to pass it to a professional typist who, by reading and \nreentering all the material, can prepare an equally inflexible document on a \ntypewriter. Corrections can be marked by pen as before, at the expense of legibility, \nand retyping is inevitable for a document of any significance. Publication again \nrequires reentry from a keyboard, with all the consequent possibilities for mistakes. \n \nWord processing changes these procedures in several ways. The output from the \ncomputer printer is more legible than most handwriting. More fundamentally, ink is \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nnot put on paper until required. It is not fixed during the recording process. The record \non the computer can be viewed on screen and altered at will. The repeated keyboard \nentry of the manual system is replaced by altering only what must be changed. \nUpdated versions of a document, such as a list of references, can be prepared without \nreentering old material. The document need not be prepared in a set sequence, but can \nbe built up from any starting points, and the contents rearranged whenever required. \nThis is a major advantage for those whose thoughts seldom follow a straight line. \n \nContent is separated from form of presentation, which can be altered separately. The \ncomputer record can generate a draft, a final document, or camera-ready copy for \noffset-litho printing. Parts of the text can be extracted for use in other contexts. With \ndescriptions of, say, fossils or borehole records, items can be subdivided or expanded \nand automatically renumbered, without affecting the rest of the document. If the \ndocument is appropriately designed, tables of contents and indexes can be prepared \nand brought up to date automatically to match the current page numbering. \n \nTyping skills, including high keyboard accuracy, good spelling, and the ability to \nvisualize and plan the layout of the final product before it is typed, are less necessary. \nScientists can record their own information, helped by tools such as a spelling \nchecker, and adjust the layout as the document develops. This may be easier than \npreparing a hand-written draft for later typing. Although clear handwriting can be \nread mechanically, simple keyboard skills are not difficult to acquire and are likely to \nprovide a better solution. Pen and paper remain more robust, versatile and cheaper in \nsome circumstances. Despite the availability of rugged hand-held notebook \ncomputers, for example, it may be easier to use a conventional notebook in the field, \nand later decide what should be transferred to a computer record.  \n \nWord processing is a step on the way to the preparation of compound documents, \nwhich may incorporate data tables and diagrams as well as text (L 3). You can include \nplaceholders to indicate where external information, perhaps selected from a database, \nis to be inserted later. You can then print circular letters or reports where the \nplaceholders are replaced by information specific to the recipient, such as their name \nand address or paragraphs matching their interest profile.  \n \nThe digital record can be accessed remotely, searched for keywords, and combined \nwith images. Links can be inserted to other documents and to points in the same \ndocument. These need not refer to text, but can link to any electronic information, \nsuch as an image or data. They can be included in a compound document produced by \na word processor, but require special facilities for manipulation and editing. Such \nconcepts are greatly extended in the World Wide Web (E 4). \n \n4. Spreadsheets and business graphics \n \nMost desktop computers offer systems for preparing and handling spreadsheets, \nwhich are of value in many areas of geoscience. Because each step of the calculation \nis clearly visible, spreadsheets are of particular interest in learning, teaching and \nexploring new ways of analyzing data. The spreadsheet is a table, or array, of \nnumbers arranged as rows and columns (see Fig. 1). The array can be large, but \nbecause the program offers simple procedures for entering and adjusting data, \nspreadsheets are also useful for small illustrative tables to insert in a report. New rows \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nand columns can be created by adding new data or by inserting a formula stating how \nthe new entries are to be calculated from the existing data. Because the program stores \nthe formulas, the entire spreadsheet can be recalculated automatically when entries are \nadded or amended. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Table or \u201cflat file\u201d of geological data. The array of data is held in a spreadsheet where it can be \nedited, manipulated or transferred to other programs for databasing, analysis or display. This \nspreadsheet is reproduced by permission of Rockware. More at http:\/\/www.rockware.com\/ \n \nSpreadsheet systems generally include full documentation and on-line \ndemonstrations, a good way to appreciate their characteristics and learn how to use \nthem. Their applications may lie in administrative tasks, such as keeping track of \nexpenditure and staff time on various projects, week by week. Their geoscience \napplications, where many data are collected as tables, are surprisingly varied. A \nnumber of properties or characteristics are used as column headings and their values \nare recorded in a row for each item. In this way, the data are collected consistently. \nMany computations (see F 3, Fig.1), including statistical and geophysical calculations, \ncan be set out as sequences of formulas relating successive columns in a spreadsheet. \nThis leads to rapid programming, since no complex coding is required. As \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nintermediate steps in the computation are held as separate columns, they can be \ninspected to check on unexpected results, or to get a feel for the influence of different \nfactors on the final result. \n \nSimple business graphics are widely available for desktop computers. If data have \nbeen collected in the form of a spreadsheet, it is not difficult to experiment with their \ndisplay. Simple pie charts, barcharts and x-y plots are a straightforward means of \ndisplaying the distribution of values and the relationships between variables, and are \nsuitable for including in word processor documents. They are as relevant to science as \nto business, and you should certainly be aware of their existence. \n \n5. Capturing data and images \n \nSpreadsheets and database systems provide means of data entry and editing, including \nthe possibility of creating your own form to enter and check data on screen (D Fig.3). \nField or other observations can be manually recorded on printed forms, designed to \nensure that all the necessary data are recorded systematically. They make it easier to \ntransfer the data to the computer at a later date, particularly if they match a form on \nscreen. It is also possible, though not necessarily cost-effective, to take rugged and \nportable computers into the field, where they can store records as the observations are \nmade (Briner et al., 1999). This simplifies review of the information and may help \nwith initial analysis. The course of the investigation can then proceed on the basis of \nwhat has already been discovered.  \n \nSome surveying instruments and positioning systems can plot locations directly to a \ncomputer map. Up-to-date accounts of the satellite-based Global Positioning System \n(GPS) and trials of surveying instruments can be found on the Web, and a complete \noverview in Hofmann-Wellenhof et al. (1997). Expensive data-collection instruments, \nsuch as geochemical equipment in the laboratory or some geophysical equipment in \nthe field, are usually linked to a computer or to a digital recording device. A computer \nhas the advantage that some processing of the data can be done at the time of capture, \nand it may be possible to adjust or control the instrument by feedback reflecting the \nincoming data. \n \nImages can be generated from graphic programs, as mentioned in the last section. \nExisting images, such as diagrams, maps or photographs can be captured, that is \nrecorded for use in the computer, with a scanner. The scanner captures the image as a \nraster, a set of colored or monochrome dots on an evenly-spaced grid, typically at a \nresolution of 300 dots per inch or 15 dots per mm, and perhaps four times as many for \na high-quality image. Images use a considerable amount of storage space, from 1 to \n24 or more bits for each dot, depending on color resolution. Once captured, image \nediting and enhancement is possible with appropriate software. Color and density can \nbe modified, the resolution can be changed, the size and shape of the image can be \nadjusted, or part of the image can be selected by cropping. Images can be combined, \nfor example by overlaying small pie charts of lithology ratios on a scanned map. \n \nScanning is an important means of capturing data. It can capture images of text on a \nprinted page. Optical character recognition (OCR) systems can convert from the \nimage to a word-processor representation of the characters. As this is a moderately \nexpensive and error-prone process, it would not normally be used if the text had \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part C (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nalready been keyed in and was available in computer-readable form. It would \nprobably, however, cost less than rekeying the document. \n \n6. Information delivery and presentation \n \nA surprisingly important ingredient in the success of computers is the widespread \navailability of good-quality printers.  It is surprising because the rapid availability of \ninformation on the computer screen might seem to make the paper copy less \nnecessary. However, paper remains a most convenient medium for reading and \nstudying documents of any significant length. The ability to receive documents from a \ndistant source and print them locally does, however, mark a significant change. \nDocuments can be maintained by the originator, and obtained, edited and printed by \nthe reader. The consequences (M 2.1) amount to a fundamental change in the \nprocedures of publication. \n \nHypertext documents (E 4) can similarly be delivered and viewed on the screen. In \nprint, of course, it is possible to arrange the document only as a single sequence, and \nthe network structure is lost.  Multimedia insertions, such as audio, video or computer \nprograms, cannot be transferred to paper. Electronic documents can, however, be \ncited in a paper document (see IFLA(1998) and ISO (1999) for style guides). It is \nworth remembering also that presentations to an audience can be made with a suitable \nprojector, and software such as Microsoft PowerPoint. The images and video from the \ncomputer screen can be projected to a large screen and sound to a loudspeaker system. \n \nThe ability to pass information between systems depends on shared standards. At a \nbasic level, most systems can accept ASCII characters and thus a character string can \nbe passed between them. Different versions of the same word processing system can \ngenerally exchange more detailed information, including adjustment of lines to left, \nright or center, font, point size, and italic, bold or underlined. By saving the document \nin rich text format (RTF), this information may also be exchangeable between \ndifferent types of word processor. Similarly, images and multimedia can be \ntransmitted in various standard forms using hypertext transmission protocol (http). \nThe appearance of a page can be represented in the Postscript language (E 6), \nincluding both images and text. However, this is not appropriate if the text is to be \nedited by the recipient, as it might require redesign of the entire page layout. Portable \ndata format (PDF) is a possible compromise, allowing full access to the text in order, \nfor example, to search for a keyword, while preserving the appearance of the page. \nWhere the recipient is more concerned with content than appearance, particularly \nwhere text searching and editing is required, a simpler format, such as RTF, is more \neffective and efficient. \n \nSome familiarity with the general use of desktop computers is a good starting point \nfor anyone intending to make serious use of computer methods. They should then be \nable to create simple and compound documents on the computer, and understand the \ngraphical user interface. It is argued later (L 6.3) that the ability to integrate \ninformation types will have important consequences for the process of publication. \nThe ability to manipulate and analyze quantitative data will continue to transform the \nways in which scientists express and exchange ideas. Most of the features of IT which \nare set to have a huge impact on geoscience can be seen in embryo in systems on the \nhumble desktop machine. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000.
