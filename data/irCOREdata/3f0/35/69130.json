A broad range of \nliterature has revealed that corporate law firms have grown in size and geographical \nreach thanks to their central role in lubricating financial markets and activities from \ncurrency trading and the work of hedge funds, to mergers and acquisitions and the \nfinancial restructuring of transnational corporations (Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2008; \nFlood, 2007; Quack, 2007). Massive increases in profits, such as the 157 percent \nabsolute increase in profit per equity partner experienced by the ten largest English \ncorporate law firms between 1993 and 2008 (Legal Business, 2008) are, therefore, \nunlikely to come as a shock to people familiar with the workings of the international \nfinancial system and the economies of world cities such as London and New York.1 \nBut, we contend, the story of the growing profitability of large corporate law firms and \nthe increasing remuneration of leading partners in these firms is not as simple as it \nmight first appear. Specifically, in this paper we suggest that the extraordinary \nincreases in the profitability of large and global corporate law firms recorded, in \nparticular, over the past decade are not only a result of firms generating more and \nmore demand for their work and charging ever higher fees for their services. Whilst \nthis is part of the story, in this paper we argue that spikes in profitability are also the \n                                            \n1\n The 157 percent increase refers to growth in profit levels excluding inflation. \n 2 \nresult of a process of financialization that has reengineered law firms to make them \nappear to be ever more profitable and successful.  \n \nAs a concept, financialization is used in the existing literature to capture a diverse \narray of changes associated with the penetration of financial market logics into the \nmanagement and organization of business. Here we draw on one particular line of \nwork which highlights how financial logics have redefined corporate governance and \nre-orientated the mandates of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial \nOfficers (CFOs) towards the generation of shareholder value through the payment of \ndividends and sustained increases in the firm\u201fs share price (see Feng et al. [2001] \nand Froud et al. [2006] for theoretical explanations and Froud et al. [2002], O\u201fNeill \n[2001] and Pike [2006] for empirical case studies).  \n \nWe are, of course, at an interesting juncture in the process of financialization. Events \nduring 2007 and 2008 in the banking sector have shown the frailties of the short term \nprofit maximisation associated with shareholder value logics in terms of the long-term \nstability of firms. Indeed, the financialized model of capitalism and its focus on \nshareholder value has come under so much scrutiny that the former GE chief Jack \nWelch, one of the accepted \u201efathers\u201f of such logics, declared in early 2009 that the \nidea was \u201edumb\u201f because shareholder value has became the focus of strategy, not \nthe outcome of successful strategy (Financial Times, 2009). Such a realization \ncomes as no surprise to the authors cited above, who have offered a range of \ncritiques of financialized shareholder logics. But it does pose a number of interesting \nstrategic questions for firms that have become enchanted by the logic of shareholder \nvalue and proxy indicators of such value, for example Economic Value Added \n(EVATM) or in the case of the legal industry Profits Per Equity Partner (PEP)..  \n \n 3 \nIn this context, this paper draws on cultural economy debates which focus on the \ndiscursive construction and reproduction of management practices designed to \nenhance shareholder value to interpret the restructuring and apparent growth in \nprofitability of large English corporate law firms between 1993 and 2008. Firstly, the \npaper makes an empirical contribution to debates about financialization by \nconsidering the intriguing case of large law firms, the rise to pre-eminence of PEP as \na metric in the legal industry, and the resultant way that privately held organisations, \nnot listed on stock markets, have become enchanted by management logics similar \nto those promoted by shareholder value discourses. As another example of what \nLeyshon and Thrift (2007) would call the capitalization of everything, we also \nconsider how large law firms\u201f obsessions with PEP as a financial performance metric \nmight explain the impacts of the current credit crunch on law firms and the fact that \nthese have been much more severe than in previous recessions. This potentially \nprovides another empirical example of the frailties of financialized practice and the \nshort-termism associated with shareholder value discourses. Secondly, and \ntheoretically, the paper explores the geographies of financialization in the legal \nindustry by focussing on the specific contextual factors that led large English \ncorporate law firms to reengineer themselves to enhance performance as measured \nby the new PEP metric. We argue that whilst such a process of financialization has \naffected the strategies of large law firms worldwide, the specific timing and nature of \nchanges in the English context are mediated by a series of geographically contingent \nfactors. In particular, we consider the way changing regulatory environments and the \nresultant changes to institutional logics were intimately tied to the construction of a \nparticular conjunctural moment in which financial discourses associated with the PEP \nmetric gained legitimacy and took hold of law firm strategy in England. This reveals \nthe power of situated analyses of financialization in explaining the proliferation of \nfinancial logics both across space and between industries.  \n \n 4 \n \nTheories of financialization \n \nConstructing models of the financialized firm \n \nOne of the main contributions of cultural economy perspectives on financialization \nhas been to highlight the new metrics used by pension fund managers and other \ncapital market actors in financial analyses of firms over the last 20 years or so. \nShareholder value measures such as EVATM, Market Value Added (MVA), Total \nShareholder Return (TSR) and Cash Flow Return on Investment (CFROI) have now \nbecome well known both within the business world but also in academic studies (e.g. \nGleadle and Cornelius, 2008; Lazonick and O\u201fSullivan, 2000) as firms have become \nintertwined with financial markets in ways which force them to constantly prioritise the \ndelivery of shareholder value. Such models, and the practices they promote, gained \nlegitimacy because of the powerful voices of the media, of activist investors such as \npension funds and of consultants like the Boston Consulting Group and Stern \nStewart who present shareholder value as the only way to assess the success of a \nfirm and the only influence to consider when managing a firm (Feng et al., 2001). \nThis is, then, an example of the effect of what Thrift (1997) describes as the circuit of \nsoft capitalism in which management gurus, the media and business schools \nadvance economic practices claimed to optimise performance in the \u201enew\u201f knowledge \neconomy (see also Clark et al. [2004] and Greenfield and Williams [2007] on the role \nof the media).  \n \nAs a result of these discourses of shareholder value and their power, measures such \nas EVATM increasingly guide the actions of senior managers (O\u201fNeill, 2001) because \nof the way they produce a series of measurable quantitative \u201efacts\u201f about the success \n 5 \nof the firm. These facts then become the target of management strategies. Indeed, \none of the outcomes of the pre-eminence of shareholder value logics, according to \nLazonick and O\u201fSullivan (2000), is a series of important changes as strategies \ndesigned to pursue long-term objectives such as market share get replaced with \nshort term strategies designed to immediately enhance performance as measured by \nmetrics such as TSR and EVATM. According to Lazonick and O\u201fSullivan (2000), such \nforms of financialized management involve a shift away from a \u201eretain and reinvest\u201f \nallocative regime in which growing the firm through the recycling of profits is the main \npriority, to a \u201edownsize and distribute\u201f regime in which changes to the labour force \nstructure and\/or capital divestures and\/or strategic re-focussing of the firm are used \nto allow more surplus profits to be distributed to shareholders. As Lazonick and \nO\u201fSullivan show, this leads to surprising strategies such as redundancies at times of \nboom as part of attempts to cut costs, reduce investment in the business and free up \ncapital for distribution to shareholders, thus enhancing shareholder value as defined \nby metrics like TSR.  \n \nHowever, as Froud et al. (2006) show using case studies of GlaxoSmithKline, Ford \nand GE, \u201edownsize and distribute\u201f regimes may help to boost a firm\u201fs short term \nperformance as measured by TSR or other metrics of shareholder value, but in \nreality hide deeper problems with the firm\u201fs market or products; problems which are \neventually brought to light in a downturn when the firm can no-longer \u201ehide\u201f its \nweaknesses.  Consequently, as Froud et al. (2006, 65) put it, we might say that \u201cthe \nrhetoric of shareholder value sets management on a utopian quest for growth and \nhigher returns from capital which has variable and uncertain consequences\u201d. As \nFroud et al. argue, measures such as EVATM and TSR do not lead, then, to the stable \nadoption of homogeneous financialized management and \u201esurgery\u201f strategies \ndesigned to enhance shareholder value. Following du Gay and Pryke (2002) and \nadopting a performative perspective (see in particular MacKenzie and Millo, 2003), \n 6 \nFroud et al. (2006, 71-72) argue that discourses of shareholder value produce \nfinancialized management practices rather than represent practices that already \nexist. Models such as TSR influence the thinking of managers and lead to the \ndevelopment of a range of untried and untested techniques designed to enhance the \nfirm\u201fs performance as measured by shareholder value metrics. Hence those adopting \na cultural economy approach suggest that the affects of such \u201eimprovised\u201f financial \nmanagement practices on firms are at best unclear and at worst damaging because \nunexpected side effects can erode the long-term ability of the firm to respond to \nmarket challenges of opportunities.  \n \nIn the second half of the paper we examine how such interpretations of financialized \nmanagement practices can be used to explain the drivers of changes in the structure \nand ultimately profitability of law firms over recent years. First, however, it is \nimportant to consider how geography influences financial management practices and \nthe way such practices are developed, diffused and enacted.  \n \n \nGeographies of financialization \n \nGeography exercises multiple influences over the development and diffusion of the \ndiscourse of shareholder value and the resultant financially orientated management \npractices. For example, Pike (2006) shows how, in assessments of shareholder \nvalue, both the geography of the firm being assessed and the geography of those \nmaking the assessment influence management practices. Using the case of the \nclosure of the Vaux brewery in Sunderland, Pike (2006, 216) reveals how \n\u201cphenomena such as financialization and shareholder value are necessarily shaped \nand contested by specific and particular arrangements of spatialized social relations, \nsocial agency, and socio-institutional contexts over time, across space and in place\u201d. \n 7 \nThis suggests more attention needs to be paid to the way geography can determine \nthe impacts of financialized practices, something Leyshon and Thrift (2007) also call \nfor by highlighting how capitalization both actively exploits the geographical \nspecificities of places but also unevenly effects (positively and negatively) different \nlocations. Similarly, Froud et al. (2001, 104-105) note that \u201cFinancialization is not an \nimmanent principle because its spread is limited by structural barriers within, and by \ninstitutional differences between, national economies\u201d.  \n \nAs a result, it is now generally accepted that the homogenisation thesis in relation to \nthe spread of shareholder value logics and financialized management practices is \nmisleading (L\u00fctz, 2004). However, this does not mean that forms of shareholder \nvalue driven financialized management are not becoming more and more common in \ndifferent national contexts. As Clark et al. (2002) show using the case of Germany, \nAnglo-American Accounting standards and pension fund practices have begun to \npenetrate continental European countries as negotiated compromises are reached \nabout the implementation of financial models of management that prioritise \nshareholder value. Culpepper (2005) makes a similar point using the example of \nFrance and shows that regulatory reform, whilst not automatically leading on its own \nto the adoption of financialized management models, is, when accompanied by wider \ninstitutional change in attitudes and opinions relating to work and management \npractices, an important ingredient in the international diffusion and reproduction of \nshareholder value logics and financialized management. Table 1 offers further \nexamples of the connection between regulation and the adoption of financial \nbusiness practices. This suggests, following Jackson and Deeg (2008), that it is \nimportant to develop explanations of the effects of functional change - i.e. political \nchange relating to regulatory context - and of institutional change - i.e. business \nnorms, on the adoption of new financialized management techniques in different \ncontexts.  \n 8 \n[Insert table 1] \n   \nThe rest of the paper, therefore, examines, firstly, the nature of financialized \nmanagement in law firms and the way discourses of financialization have shaped \nfirms\u201f strategies over recent years. The paper then, secondly, examines the situated \ncontext influencing the emergence and adoption of financialized practices in English \nlaw firms. In doing this analysis shows how the reproduction of financialized logics is \nconjuntural and mediated by broader political-economic and institutional context \nwhich defines the timing and nature of the process of financialization. We conclude \nwith some reflections on how financialization may have contributed to the impact of \ncredit crisis on the legal profession.  \n \n \nMethodology \n \nOur analysis is constructed using a triangulation of data from various sources. \nQuantitative material charting the composition and performance of large English law \nfirms was taken from The Legal Business 100 survey between 1993 and 2008. This \nlongitudinal analysis allows us to extrapolate historical trends in the financial \nperformance and organizational structure of English law firms whilst also providing \ninsights into the changing management practices that are associated with \nfinancialization. We focus our analysis on the 10 largest firms, primarily because of \nthe emphasis that these firms have placed on financialized management techniques \nin recent years. The trends identified are, nonetheless, relevant to the wider sample \nof firms analysed in the aforementioned survey. These trends are also relevant more \nbroadly to large law firms worldwide, and in particular to US based practices. \nHowever, here we focus on the largest firms in England to help tease out the \n 9 \ngeographically specific way in which English firms \u201ebecame financialized\u201f in the late \n1990s and early 2000s. \n  \nWe also completed an extensive survey of articles in legal publications aimed at \npractitioners in the UK (The Lawyer, Legal Business and Legal Week). This provided \nfurther detail of the changing financial performance and strategies of firms as well as \ninsight into media reactions to these changes. Finally we undertook twenty interviews \nduring late 2006 and early 2007 in large corporate law firms in England. Interviewees \nwere drawn from firms representing different segments of The Legal Business 100 \nsurvey, ranging from the largest, multi-office international firms through to nation-\nwide firms and single office practices. Interviews lasted between 40 and 70 minutes, \nwere recorded, transcribed and then coded. All interviewees were questioned about \nthe strategy of the firm they worked for, recent changes to the organization of the \nfirm, working conditions and practices within the firm, managerial structures and \nstyles, and the impact of commercial (financial and client-driven) pressures on their \nday-to-day work. Analysis of the interviews is used to help explain the trends \nidentified in the quantitative data collected. \n \n \nThe emergence of financialized large law firms \n \nIn many ways, the adoption of financial practices by large law firms is a significant \ndevelopment. Law, as one of the few state sponsored professions like accountancy, \nis supposed to have a fiduciary duty towards clients and the broader public and, \nhistorically at least, is supposed to represent a public safeguard service. Law firms \nhad not, therefore, traditionally been seen as organisations in which commercial \nlogics prevailed. To this end, until recently law firms In England and in many \n 10 \ncountries throughout the world could only exist as partnerships in which the owners \nof the firm were those delivering the services.2 In many ways the logic of this takes \nus back to the work of Berle and Means (1932) who studied the dangers of \nseparating ownership and control in firms because of the moral hazard it creates. In \nlaw firms, it was assumed that if lawyers owned and managed the firm they would \nplace the client\u201fs interests and their professional responsibilities above all else \nbecause profitability relied on the firm\u201fs reputation for service quality and the long-\nterm development of this reputation, rather than on the extraction of short-term profits \nto enhance the firm\u201fs success in financial terms (Empson and Chapman, 2006). In \naddition, it was also assumed that the owners, the partners, would also be acting as \nthe managers of junior lawyers and would ensure all staff maintained the levels of \nquality expected so as to protect the reputation of the firm.   \n \nIn today\u201fs post-Enron context, many would be rightly sceptical of suggestions that \nprofessionals, and corporate lawyers in particular, provide publicly spirited services. \nAs Hanlon (2004) describes, idealistic visions of what lawyers and law firms are and \ndo, if they were ever accurate, have today certainly been diluted by the rise of mega-\nlaw firms (see table 2) with their business orientated outlook. However, whilst such \nlarge law firms were always firmly rooted in what Heinz and Lauman (1982) referred \nto as \u201ethe corporate hemisphere of the law\u201f, over the past 15 years or so the largest \ncorporate law firms have undergone a significant reorganization and, as a result, \nincreasingly mirror in their structure and operations the market-listed, financially \nmotivated clients which they advise.  \n[Insert table 2 here] \n \n                                            \n2\n As we discuss below, reforms in Australia and England and Wales have changed this \nsituation in the period post 2000. \n 11 \nTable 3 captures the main changes involved in this process. Two trends are \nparticularly significant:  \n1. In the 1990s a rapid growth in profits as measured by PEP, which outstrips \ngrowth in revenue, together with a significant increase in the number of \nsalaried solicitors (associate and assistants). Growth in the category of \nsalaried solicitor outstripped expansion in equity partners (senior lawyers), \nthus leading to growing leverage ratios (the ratio of junior salaried lawyers to \nsenior equity partners). \n2. In the 2000s the remarkable expansion of a relatively new employment \ncategory: salaried partners. This occurred alongside an unprecedented year \non year increase in PEP. \n \nIn the next section we consider the causes and consequences of these trends and \nexplain how they are related to the financialization of the largest law firms in England.  \nIn particular, we consider the role of PEP as a metric used to measure law firms\u201f \nsuccess and the way the discourses associated with this metric, which is premised \non a similar logic to that of shareholder value, encouraged the penetration of financial \nmanagement practices deep into the fabric of law firms.  \n \n[Insert table 3 here] \n \n \nPEP and new financial discourses in the legal industry \n \nOriginally developed in the USA in the 1980s by the American Lawyer magazine, just \nlike shareholder value, PEP has become the metric of law firms\u201f success. In the \nEnglish context, the first PEP rankings were produced in 1993 by Legal Business \nand, since then, the publication\u201fs annual reports of PEP have become a key \n 12 \nreference for those wanting to assess the success of different firms. Indeed, by the \nlate 1990s other publications had also begun to champion the PEP metric and in \n2007 The Lawyer, one of the most influential legal publications in England, trumpeted \nits own \u201eTop of the PEPs\u201f table designed to provide \u201cthe definitive inside track on the \nperformance of the UK's biggest law firms\u201d (The Lawyer 2007a). In addition, as well \nas specialist legal publications, the financial press has also played an important role \nin the rise to prominence of this metric. The Financial Times now gives annual \n\u201einnovative lawyers\u201f awards, one category being management which can include \n\u201cissues such as international expansion and rising profitability\u201d (see \nhttp:\/\/media.ft.com\/cms\/d1fbb852-ce3a-11db-b5c8-000b5df10621.pdf [last accessed \n28th April 2009]). The winner of the first management award in 2007 was Eversheds \nfor its partner profit sharing scheme.  \n \nThe influence of the media in the production and proliferation of PEP as a discourse \nshould, therefore, not be underestimated. Mirroring the findings of Clark et al. (2004) \nand Greenfield and Williams (2007), it seems that the way the media analyses, ranks \nand publicises the performance of law firms legitimates certain types of action and, in \nparticular, attempts by management to improve PEP. Winning an award from the FT \nor improving one\u201fs position in the relevant PEP tables has become a key concern for \nlaw firm leaders. Senior and managing partners, often supported by developed media \nand public relations departments, actively engage with the press as a way to secure \nfavourable write-ups which could enhance their firm\u201fs reputation. Reflecting this \nobsession, the managing partner of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer made the \nfollowing comment about the firm\u201fs past performance after restructuring delivered a \nmassive rise in PEP, \u201cwe did not have the financial performance that is necessary or \nappropriate for a firm of the calibre of ours\u201d (Lawyer Podcast, February 2007. \nAvailable from www.thelawyer.com). Similarly, after the announcement that the firm \nhad broken the \u00a3500,000 PEP barrier, the managing partner of Eversheds said, \n 13 \n\u201cprofitability has been one of our key targets over the past year, and with PEP \nbreaking the \u00a3500,000 barrier, we have proven our ability to deliver on our promises\u201d \n(The Lawyer 2007b).   \n \nOf course, the result of this new obsession is a devastating critique of firms failing to \nincrease PEP. These firms are seen as poorly managed organisations in need of \nrefurbishment. So when the firm Shoosmiths reported a 27 percent increase in \nturnover but only a three percent rise in PEP, these results were described as \u201emixed\u201f \nand blame was placed on \u201ca period of sustained expansion and a major recruitment \ndrive across seven UK offices [that] have taken their toll on the firm\u201fs profitability\u201d \n(The Lawyer 2007c). It would seem, then, that in the new epoch of financialization, \nlong-term investments associated with growth, which are typical of a \u201eretain and \nreinvest\u201f regime (Lazonick and O\u201fSullivan, 2000) are not necessarily seen as wholly \npositive. The next section of the paper, therefore, considers the way the discursive \npower of PEP metrics and rankings has influenced the management of law firms and \nhas led to introduction of new organizational structures and employment patterns in \nthe legal profession.  \n \n \nFinancialization in action: the restructuring of English law firms \n \nDespite the fact that law firms, with the exception of one Australian firm, continue to \nbe structured as partnerships and have no external shareholders or institutional \ninvestors to satisfy, the effects of media-inspired concerns about PEP seem to have \nled to the adoption of similar management logics to those used in shareholder-value \ndriven organizations. This implies a series of radical adjustments and structural \ndevelopments resonant of the forms of \u201esurgery\u201f (Lazonick and O\u201fSullivan, 2000) and \nstrategic re-focussing usually associated with processes of financialization (Feng et \n 14 \nal., 2001). Firstly, large law firms, and particularly a number of those listed in table 2, \nhave refocused on a limited array of practice areas, such as capital markets and \nespecially work associated with derivatives and \u201eexotic\u201f financial products, which are \nclosest to the logic and operations of \u201efinance capitalism\u201f and which offer some of the \nmore handsome financial rewards. Secondly, and consequently, there has been a \nshift in the largest firms from retainer relationships, whereby lawyers act as long-term \nadvisers, to a focus on one-off transactions from which maximum fees can be \ngenerated. Finally, there has been the introduction of new organizational structures \n(e.g. industry focused groups), again designed to maximise profits through \nspecialisation in particular types of legal transactions at the expense of full service \nprovision.  \n \nPerhaps most significantly, though, law firms have engaged, over recent years, in a \nradical restructuring of their own internal division of labour. Such surgeries are \ndesigned to improve performance as measured by PEP and have turned law firms \ninto very different organizations to their predecessors. However, as our analysis \nbelow demonstrates, the changes associated with the reorganization of firms\u201f internal \ndivisions of labour are intimately related to the frailties of PEP as a measure of \nsuccess in the legal profession. Our analysis shows the ease with which \nmanagement techniques can improve PEP without actually improving (or by even \ndamaging) the underlying performance of the firm, something which is particularly \npertinent in the context of the current financial crisis.  \n \n \nLeverage as financial management \n \nPEP, crucially, does not measure the total profits generated by a firm, but the total \nprofits divided by the number of equity partners. Equity partners are the \u201eowners\u201f of \n 15 \nthe firm and, as such, share the profits but also risks associated with legal practice. \nTo become an equity partner, an individual will usually have to serve many years as \nan \u201eapprentice\u201f lawyer, or be accepted into the partnership by existing equity partners \nas a \u201elateral hire\u201f from another firm (incidentally a practice which is increasingly \nsignificant as firms scramble to build their profitability by poaching key profit \ngenerators, known as \u201erain makers\u201f in the legal profession). As the \u201etraditional\u201f legal \npartnership was made up of equity partners only, profit per partner in the past was \neffectively the same as PEP. Increasingly, though, an expanding cohort of salaried \nsolicitors, whose remuneration is not linked to profits (besides the effect of bonus \nschemes), operate as a new and growing tier in what is an increasingly pyramidal \ndivision of labour. These salaried workers allow more profit to be generated but, as a \nconsequence of their salaried status, do not affect the number of people sharing the \nprofits, hence delivering an increase in PEP and improvements in the relevant \nranking tables. In reality, then, profits per partner (PPP) or profits per lawyer (PPL) \nmight be better measures of the performance of a firm. Indeed, analysing PPP and \nPPL between 1993 and 2008 reveals that the reorganization of law firms has led to \nexaggerated increases in PEP (157 percent 1993-2008) compared to more \u201eaccurate\u201f \nmeasures of efficiency and success (85 and 80 percent for PPP and PPL \nrespectively). However, because of PEP\u201fs hegemony as the measure of law firms\u201f \nsuccess, managing partners have focussed on reorganizing the labour process in \nways that optimise performance as measured by this metric.  \n \nAs a result, in the first stage, as Ackroyd and Muzio (2007) report, throughout the \n1980s and 1990s attempts by partners in law firms to drive up profitability involved \nleveraging the performance and contribution of a rapidly expanding cohort of salaried \njunior solicitors (associates). Consequently, the legal profession endured a \nmonumental shift from a predominantly self-employed to a predominantly employed \noccupation with associate to equity partner ratios climbing from 1:2 in the mid 80s to \n 16 \n1.8:1 in 2006. These figures look even more impressive if we focus on the largest \nfirms, where such changes have been most pronounced. As indicated by table 3, in \n2008 the average leverage ratio for the ten largest English firms was 6.9:1.   \n \nSuch changes respond to a clear financial logic: a salaried lawyer can generate \nsubstantially more fees than her labour costs (this surplus can oscillate, depending \non the firm\u201fs size, between 2.5 and 4.8 times wage costs). Indeed, as illustrated by \ntable 4, the appropriation of surpluses generated by non-equity workers currently \nconstitutes the foundation of law firm economics and a key avenue to enhancing \nprofitability. The rule of the game in the financialized law firm is therefore simple: \nincrease the number of people who bake the cake (the number of salaried lawyers) \nwhilst stabilising or reducing the number of people who can share the cake (the \nnumber of equity partners) (Maister, 1993). Larger helpings will inevitably follow in \nthe form of enhanced PEP, even though actual profits per lawyer may have remained \nstable or even declined.  \n \nIt is not surprising, therefore, that Table 3 shows an increase in associate numbers \nand, therefore, growing leverage ratios throughout 1993 to 2003 period and that this \ncoincides with gradual improvements in PEP. However, the increases are perhaps \nnot as large as might have been expected, particularly in the period 1998-2003. In \naddition to broader contextual factors such as the dot.com slump of the early 2000s, \nthis situation can also be partly explained by the aggressive expansion and \nglobalization of firms in the late 1990s which involved many mergers and the \nacquisition of partners in offices inside and outside of England. This led to a marked \nincrease in equity partners which somewhat diluted the effect of the leveraging \nstrategies which were being implemented in the latter part of the 1990s. In effect, \nfirms had not completely developed a recipe to maximise the growth of PEP. The \npost 2000 period, as discourses of performance and profitability gained traction, \n 17 \ntherefore, led to the development of even more radical forms of surgery as firms \nrestructured to maximize PEP. \n \n[insert table 4 here] \n \nRestructuring the partnership to manage PEP \n \nThe redefinition and dilution of the concept of partnership through the creation of the \nnew role of salaried partner and the increasing recourse to de-equitization have been \nkey strategies adopted by law firms in their post-2000 restructuring. As table 3 \nshows, from 2000 the number of salaried partners found in firms has expanded \nsignificantly. These individuals do not share profits, are not co-owners of the firm, but \nare handed the title partner because of its symbolic value. Whilst this category has \nexisted from sometime prior to the period in question, numbers of salaried solicitors \nwere so marginal that both Legal Business and The Lawyer did not collect data on \nthem. However, since 2002 salaried partners have become the fastest growing \nsection of the professional labour force, expanding by over 34%. Thus, salaried \npartnership, from an anomaly found only in a minority of firms, has been recast as a \nformal step in an increasingly elongated professional career structure. Writing in the \n80s, Richard Abel (1988) estimated an average wait of 5.5 years after qualification \nfor a lawyer to achieve equity status in a firm; today this has doubled to over 10 \nyears. Furthermore, promotion is increasingly tied to some formal financial targets \nsuch as the ability to generate 3 times more revenues than ones own wage costs \n(Hanlon, 2004). Thus, introducing salaried partners as a form of labour market \n\u201esurgery\u201f responds to a clear financial logic: this new position delivers a convenient \nand acceptable device to prolong leverage and increase profitability.  \n \n 18 \nMost radically, recent interventions have actually sought the reduction of equity \npartner headcount in a period of boom for legal services. Indeed, as indicated by \ntable 3,  between 2003 and 2008 the number of equity partners employed in the 10 \nlargest firms in the UK contracted by 1% despite revenues growth of over 27%. \nThese trends corroborate growing anecdotal evidence of de-equitization (redundancy \nof equity partners). This is a momentous and somewhat contested development and \nsignifies a dramatic break with the past because of how partners, the owners of the \nfirms, are treated as costs to be efficiently managed. \u201eChopping dead wood\u201f, to use a \ncommon expression, is a useful instrument in today\u201fs increasingly bloated, \nheterogeneous and geographically dispersed partnerships. This reduction in equity \npartners seems to be bound up with the quest of sustaining and expanding \nprofitability by downgrading lesser performing partners or simply those working in \nless remunerative offices or practice areas that would otherwise dilute PEP and \naffect a firm\u201fs position in key ranking tables (The Lawyer, 2009h).  Thus, the updated \nstrategy may be to actually reduce rather than simply stabilize those who share the \ncake, whilst of course continuing to expand those who participate in profit generation.  \n \nIt seems, then, that financial considerations and, in particular, the quest to enhance \nPEP, lie at the heart of one of the key developments in the legal profession: the \nreorganization of the ownership of firms \u2013 i.e. the partnership \u2013 through the creation \nof new positions in the division of labour in the form of the salaried partner and the \nredefinition of the very notion of partnership as a contingent and temporary status \nthat can be withdrawn according to profitability considerations. Importantly, though, \nfrom a geographical perspective, the development and acceptance in the English \ncontext of PEP discourses and metrics can only be fully understood by considering \nthe situated political-economic context in which English firms have been operating \nand the way this has helped create a conjunctural moment in which PEP league \ntables and financialized management gain legitimacy.  \n 19 \n \n \nSituating the financialization of English law firms: neo-liberalism and \nregulatory reform  \n \nWhen Legal Business first published its PEP tables in 1993, the re-regulation of the \nEnglish legal market had already led to concerns about the profitability of English law \nfirms. The key re-regulatory process causing this was the re-discovery in the 1980s \nby Thatcher\u201fs conservative administration of a neo-liberal political agenda which \nemphasized and celebrated competition, customer choice, open markets and private \nenterprise in economic affairs, including in the professions (Abel, 2003). However, \nthe English system of the professions, with its emphasis on occupational licensing, \nself-regulation and restrictive arrangements that effectively created monopolies for \nservices, did not sit comfortably with the new-found neo-liberal ideology. In the legal \nprofession this led, amongst other things, to the suspension of some restrictive \narrangements (on advertising and minimum fees for example) (Abel, 1988; 2003) but \nalso the reduction of governmental expenditure on legal services through reforms of \nthe Legal Aid scheme (Paterson and Goriely, 1999) and the partial liberalization of \nkey monopolies such as conveyancing (Abel, 1988; 2003; Sherr, 1994; Muzio and \nAckroyd, 2005). Perhaps most significant for our argument here, though, was the \nimpact of neo-liberal ideals on London\u201fs financial markets and their subsequent \naffects on the legal industry. \n \nRe-regulation and financialization I: The legal \u2018big bang\u2019 \nThe 1986 \u201ebig bang\u201f, which opened financial markets in London to foreign firms for \nthe first time, was intimately related to the neo-liberal reforms of the 1980s and a \ndesire for market competition in all areas of the economy. Indeed, \u201ebig bang\u201f acted as \n 20 \na blue-print for successive de-regulatory initiatives designed to maintain and develop \nLondon\u201fs world city status. In particular, the financial \u201ebig bang\u201f helped to position \nLondon as a global marketplace for professional advisory services, including law, \nthus preparing the ground for the legal profession\u201fs very own \u201ebig bang\u201f that \neventually took place in 1990. This reform opened up, for the first time, the English \nlegal market to overseas law firms (Cullen-Mandikos and MacPherson 2002). \nPreviously many US firms had entered London but only to provide advice on US law. \nAfter 1990, however, re-regulation allowed these firms to recruit English lawyers, \nprovide advice on English legal issues and thus compete with London\u201fs Magic Circle \nfirms (Clifford Chance, Linklaters, Freshfields, Allen & Overy and Slaughter & May). \nThis created new competition and, most significantly for our argument here, \npositioned English incumbents against competitors with significantly higher levels of \nprofits.  \n \nHere is not the place to review the complex array of differences between English and \nUS large law firms (but see Faulconbridge, 2008a; Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2007). \nIt is, however, well known that one of the major differences has long been the \napproach taken to profitability and the remuneration of lawyers, with the US \u201eeat what \nyou kill\u201f system prioritising financial success by tying equity partners\u201f take-home \nsalary to the profits they generate themselves (Regan, 2004). In contrast, the English \nlockstep system bases partner pay on years of service and rewards loyalty ahead of \nprofitability. As a result of US firms\u201f emphasis on profits through the eat what you kill \nsystem, their closer ties to firms such as GE who first adopted shareholder value \nlogics, and the earlier development by the US media of PEP ranking tables, it is \nperhaps not surprising that when US firms arrived in England they were much more \nprofitable. This had, then, two effects that encouraged the adoption of financial \npractices in English law firms. First, it created reputation problems for English firms. \nBeing less profitable than US competitors created the risk of clients defecting to US \n 21 \nfirms that were apparently more successful. Second, and more pragmatically, the \nmore profitable US firms were also able to pay solicitors significantly more money \nand, therefore, poach star players from English firms. As one senior partner \ninterviewed commented about this dilemma: \n\u201c\u201eI think it\u201fs fair to say that they [reports of PEP] must have some impact.  For \nexample potential recruits may regard them as significant.  Perhaps some clients \nmake a judgment on the quality of a law firm by how well it seems to be doing in \nthose terms. So you cannot completely ignore the league tables\u201d (Senior partner, top \n10 English firm). \n  \nIt could, then, be argued that US law firms themselves were vectors of \nfinancialization. Indeed, the increasing numbers of US-UK mergers, of which the \nClifford Chance\/Rodger Wells deal is the most prominent example, exposed UK firms \nto the more individualist and performance orientated remuneration systems, to \nfinancialized practices and most crucially to the higher profitability rates of their US \ncounterparts. However, ultimately, this move towards financial practices was first \ninstigated by local regulatory developments that led to important changes to the \npolitical-economic landscape in which English law firms had to operate and survive. \nIndeed, the effects of re-regulation on the financialization of English law firms can \nalso been seen in more recent times when further regulatory changes have helped to \nreproduce and legitimize financialized management practices in law firms. \n \n \nRe-regulation and financialization II: The Legal Services Act \n \nIn the post 2000 era a second regulatory \u201ebig bang\u201f - The Legal Services Act \u2013 further \nreinforced the importance of finacialized management in the legal profession in \nEngland and Wales. As another example of reform inspired by neo-liberal doctrines, \n 22 \nunder the provisions of the Legal Services Act it will be possible, for the first time, to \nseparate ownership and control in law firms. Firms will, therefore, be able to attract \nexternal investors, such as private equity houses, and potentially \u201ego all the way\u201f with \na full stock-exchange flotation. Indeed, it was anticipated that up to fifty percent of the \nfirms in The Lawyers\u201f UK 100 survey might seek outside investors and even a stock \nexchange listing (The Lawyer, 2007d).   \n \nWhilst the Act has not taken full effect yet and its implications are still emergent and \nnot properly understood, anticipation of its provisions has certainly fuelled \nfinancialized logics and practices. Indeed, at first, metrics such as PEP were seen as \na way of valuing law firms so as to facilitate investment decisions. This led to multi-\nbillion pound stock-market valuations of the UK\u201fs leading firms (see for example The \nSunday Times, 2007). Perhaps unsurprisingly, partners may, therefore, have been \nkeen to maximise the value of their partnership equity by enhancing PEP and \nultimately the supposed value of the firm to outside investors. More recently concerns \nhave been raised about the value of PEP as a metric for investment purposes \nbecause of, amongst other things, the previously discussed ease with which firms \ncan manipulate PEP through short term surgeries without improving underlying \nperformance. Nevertheless, the regulatory change associated with the Legal \nServices Act certainly led to an intensified interest in PEP rankings, at least in the \n2003-2008 period. This helps explain the unprecedented increases in PEP levels \nnoted in this period in table 3.     \n \n \nInstitutions guiding the adoption of financial practices \n \nRegulatory reform constitutes, then, the situated political-economic context in which \nthe financialization of English law firms was possible. Neo-liberal reforms and the \n 23 \nchanges in the English legal marketplace they inspired played a key role in the \nformation of a conjectural moment in which financialized management practices \ngained legitimacy. But, in line with ideas developed in existing work (Culpepper, \n2005; Feng et al., 2001; L\u00fctz, 2004), institutional transformations were equally \nimportant, alongside and as part of the re-regulation process, in the development of \nPEP\u201fs legitimacy in the English context. It is, then, the dialogue and interaction \nbetween the regulatory and institutional that led to a period in time, between the late \n1980s and early 2000s, in which the reforms described above appeared legitimate \nand in line with common beliefs about how firms should operate. \n \nRe-regulation helped change the cultures of lawyers because of the way it elevated \nprofitability up the list of law firm partners\u201f concerns, thus making PEP a core \npreoccupation for those running large firms. This is not to say the norms and values \n(the institutions) of English lawyers were completely changed by events of the 1990s \nand 2000s. Rather, and in line with the ideas of Vitols (2004), a form of negotiated \ncompromise emerged with financial performance, measured in terms of PEP, \ncoexisting with other pre-existing values and norms; a compromise which at times \ncan break down into conflicts as the norms and value of lawyers clash with the \nfinancially driven changes previously described. For example, English lawyers have \noften resisted the development of the performance related cultures associated with \nfinancially inspired management practices (see Faulconbridge, 2008b), something \nthe firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer has experienced most notably.  \n \nFreshfields Bruckhaus Derringer has undergone a number of changes in the period \nfrom 1993 to 2008, including a merger with a German law firm designed to enhance \nthe competitiveness of the original firm in the European marketplace (the firm was \noriginally called Freshfields and gained its extended name after the merger). Indeed, \nthis merger is partly the result of but also a cause of financialized management. As \n 24 \nfigure 1 shows, the trend in terms of associate, salaried and equity partner numbers, \nand the effects of these on PEP reflect well the story outlined above. The firm grew \nleverage by expanding associate numbers in the late 1990s, introducing salaried \npartners and reducing the size of the equity partnership in the post 2000 period so to \nextract further gains in PEP. In particular this \u201fsurgery\u201f on the equity partnership was \nassociated with the need to offset the effects of less profitable offices and individuals, \nmany of which inherited as a result of the earlier merger, on the relevant profitability \nmetrics. But not all the lawyers affected by these changes have accepted the logic of \nreform. In England the firm was recently taken to an employment tribunal by a former \npartner who claimed de-equitization was unjustifiable and in a spirit contra to the \npartnership convention. The tribunal deemed that the firm had taken proportionate \nsteps in pursuit of a legitimate (profit enhancing) goal but debate continues about \nwhether this strategy is an appropriate way to manage a partnership and has led to \nmany firms reassessing the appropriateness of PEP driven strategies and their \nrelated  surgeries (The Lawyer, 2007d).  \n[insert figure 1 somewhere here] \n \nThe reactions of lawyers to the introduction of financialized practices such as partner \nde-equitization in English law firms represent, then, a brake on the financialization \nprocess because, as one competing firms\u201f managing partner put it: \n\u201cYou get to a certain level \u2013 say the \u00a3500,000 partner profits point \u2013 and the \nsqueezing more out of the machine becomes increasingly difficult; particularly if you \nare not going for the big de-equitization push. You cannot ask associates to do much \nmore than they are doing\u201d (quoted in Legal Week 2007a).  \n \n Similarly, the role of the salaried partner within partnership forms of governance has \nalso been questioned. As one interviewee commented: \n 25 \n\u201csalaried partnership is effectively glorified employees and if I wanted to have an \ninput, which I did, it would be very difficult to be heard.  And even if you were heard \nwhether anyone took any notice was a whole different matter again\u201d (Lawyer, firm in \nLawyer\u201fs UK 100 table). \n \nThus the case of large law firms represents an example of \u201enegotiated \nfinancialization\u201f. A dialogue between political-economic influences (regulation) and \ninstitutional influences creates both the moment in which financialization gains \nlegitimacy but also a context that defined its place-specific characteristics. In the \ncase of English law firms text book models of reform were not always being possible \nbecause of the situating of restructuring processes in a specific institutional context at \none moment in time. The case of English law firms shows, then, that geographical \nanalyses of financialization processes are vital because of the way regulation and \ninstitutions interact and can affect both the timing and nature of change. This means \nthat whilst law firms worldwide might have undergone surgeries as part of moves \ntowards financialized management, this may not have occurred at the same time (the \nconjunctural moment emerges, or fails to emerge, in different ways) or in exactly the \nsame way as in English firms.  \n \n \nQuestioning financial reform and the fall-out from the credit crisis \n \nIn many ways, the financialization of law firms in the early 2000s was, then, a sign of \nthe times. But, unsurprisingly, like the attempts by managers to prioritise shareholder \nvalue metrics like EVATM, the PEP inspired surgeries described above have been \nincreasingly questioned by a range of commentators over the past 12 months as a \nresult of the credit crunch and ensuing financial crisis and recession. In a recent \nreport, Hilderbrandt\/CitiBank (2008) argue that non-equity partners are actually less \n 26 \nproductive than equity partners as they lack motivation because they do not share \nprofits and feel that the increasing requirements for equity status make promotion a \nmore uncertain and less realistic career target. Indeed, in light of such concerns \nsome English lawyers originally involved in promoting financially driven practices are \nnow publicly asking questions about the dangers of the PEP \u201egame\u201f and suggesting \nthat alternatives are needed. Guy Beringer, who at the time was the managing \npartner of Allen and Overy, commented in an editorial placed on his website: \n\u201cI argue that PEP is not an appropriate measure of the success of a law firm and \nshould be replaced with measures which take account of sustainable profitability, \nclient satisfaction and staff motivation\u201d (see \nhttp:\/\/www.allenovery.com\/AOWEB\/Knowledge\/Editorial.aspx?contentTypeID=1&ite\nmID=34073&prefLangID=410).   \n \nSimilar comments were made by the Editor of Legal Week (see Legal Week 2007) \nwhilst The Lawyer now reports earnings per partner (EPP) as a way of revealing \nwhich firms are \u201ecooking the books\u201f to enhance PEP. Indeed, comparing the change \nin PEP between 1993 and 2008 with EPP reveals that again, as a more \u201eaccurate\u201f \nmeasure of efficiency and success just like PPP and PPL, EPP offers a much less \nimpressive account of \u201egrowth\u201f (70 percent growth in EPP between 1993-2008) than \nfrailer measures such as PEP (157 percent growth).  \n \nThe financialized model of the law firm deserves even more scrutiny in the context of \nthe impacts of the current financial crisis on firms. The law firms listed in table 2 are \nnow scrambling to maintain profitability by slashing costs, leading to redundancies \nand de-equitizations (The Lawyer, 2009b, 2009c, 2009d,). Indeed, by February 2009 \njob losses in the 200 largest English law firms since the onset of the credit crisis \ntotalled over 3000 (The Lawyer, 2009e). And there is evidence that PEP calculations \nare influencing key decisions as downsizing programmes try to safeguard key \n 27 \nprofitability measures by targeting equity partners as well as salaried solicitors in \nredundancy schemes. Indeed, firms such as Linklaters and Addleshaw\u201fs have culled \n13% and 11% of their partnerships respectively in their attempts to pursuit \u201esmaller \nand more profitable\u201f configurations (The Lawyer 2009a). Others, including Clifford \nChance and Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer, are currently undergoing \u201epartnership \nreshaping\u201f exercises, another term for downsizing the equity partner pool. It seems, \nthen, that PEP is still a key consideration in the current reorganization of the \nprofession and falls in PEP are deemed unacceptable even in a recession. Questions \nmight be asked, therefore, about whether responses to the current crisis are likely to \nreproduce the hegemony of financialized logics in law firm management or whether \nthe broader questions now being asked about the logics of financialized capitalism \nmight impact on the way law firms view management inspired by metrics like PEP. It \nis entirely possible that the conjunctural moment in which PEP gained legitimacy has \nnow passed and the future will involve very different measures of law firms\u201f success \nand very different management strategies.  \n \nIn this context, and perhaps more fundamentally, it could be argued that the PEP \nphenomenon is partially responsible for the severity of the crisis many law firms are \nnow facing and should therefore be disbanded in future attempts to assess law firm \nperformance. Whilst the global downturn that occurred in 2007-2008 is \nunprecedented in recent history, the structure of law firms post-PEP surgery seems \nto have left them more vulnerable than they were during previous recessions. This \nsuggestion can be developed by looking at the experience of one firm, Slaughter and \nMay, from 1993 to the current recession. The firm remains one of the most profitable \n(see table 2) despite operating in a largely traditional fashion and following a now \natypical model when compared to the financially-driven management practiced by the \nmajority of firms in our sample. This firm has a broad business base and in the post-\n2000 period did not focus excessively on the transactional work generated by \n 28 \nsecuritisation and other \u201eexotic\u201f financial instruments. It has not merged or expanded \noverseas and, as table 5 shows, does not use salaried partners in significant \nnumbers and has the most compressed leverage ratio in our sample which has \nactually declined over the period of observation. In other words, this firm has secured \nexceptional levels of performance, as measured by PEP (240 percent growth) but \nalso other indicators such as EPP (187 percent growth), PPP (223 percent growth) \nand PPL (353 percent growth), despite making only limited concessions to \ndiscourses and practices of financialized management and continuing to operate in a \nmore \u201etraditional\u201f mould. Significantly, at the time of writing, Slaughter and May has \nnot yet made any redundancies, suggesting such \u201etraditional\u201f structures are more \nstable and sustainable in the long-term because of their maintenance of an emphasis \non broad-based high quality, high margin work that uses relatively small pools of \njunior lawyers as leverage for profit generation. It would seem, then, that those \nrunning Slaughter & May did not buy into the financialized logics that had their \nmoment in the 1990s and 2000s. In contrast, many firms that did buy into this ideal \nand followed PEP-inspired management practices and focussed on quality but also \nquantity in order to boost measures of PEP through leverage, have suffered much \nmore severely as diminishing demand takes an exaggerated toll on revenues and \nprofits. The downturn has left large pools of under-employed junior lawyers in firms \nthat have adopted PEP-inspired management, pools which cannot now be sustained; \nthus turning leverage from an asset to a liability. For example, whilst Slaughter and \nMay has to utilize 5 salaried lawyers for every equity partner, Clifford Chance has to \nsupport 8, meaning reductions in fee income escalate at a much more rapid pace \nand become quickly unsustainable. It seems, then, that the recession has again \nrevealed one of the major frailties of financially-inspired management in law firms: \nshort term gains at the cost of long term instability.  \n \n \n 29 \nConclusions: the situated emergence of financialized English law firms \n \nThis paper explains the radical reorganization of large law firms in England in terms \nof the ascendency of new financialized discourses and practices which, through the \nproxy indicator of PEP, somewhat unexpectedly reproduced the logics of finance \ncapitalism in the domain of law. Thus, the case of the English legal profession \nrepresents another strand to the \u201ecapitalization of everything\u201f thesis (Leyshon and \nThrift, 1997) and shows how selective management designed to optimise perceived \nfinancial performance can reconfigure organizations that might be assumed to be \nless directly affected by the logics of financial markets. The paper reveals how in the \nprofession of law, like in other market-listed industries, the new concern for financial \ntargets and metrics fuelled a series of unprecedented surgeries leading to a radical \nreorganization of professional practices, structures, values and labour markets. In \nparticular, financial logics pervaded the shift of law towards a largely employed \noccupation as well as the redefinition of the concept of partnership itself, which \npreviously had stood still for over two centuries.  \n \nIn terms of the literatures on cultural economy and on financialization, this reveals the \nimportance of further analysing how, what Thrift (1997) calls the \u201ecircuits of soft \ncapitalism\u201f, help to \u201escript\u201f the behaviours of firms through their promotion of \nperformative models such as PEP. In the case of law, the role of PEP league tables \ncannot be underestimated and led to law firms embarking on what Feng et al. (2001) \nwould call a utopian quest for success that had uncertain consequences. The crisis \nfacing law firms as a result of the credit crunch and ensuing recession exemplifies \nthe dangers of such an approach. Firms following PEP-inspired management \nstrategies are now apparently facing unprecedented challenges in terms of the need \nfor redundancies both to offset the bloating associated with PEP-inspired leverage \n 30 \nand to ensure the impacts of the recession on PEP performance are minimised so to \nmaintain the position of the firm in league tables. This shows that reforms associated \nwith financialized management affect workers not only at times of the initial \u201esurgery\u201f \nbut also in the long-term as the stability of the firm and employment is potentially \njeopardised.       \n \nThis paper has also sought to develop understanding of how geographically specific \ncontexts mediate the reproduction of financialized logics in particular conjunctural \nmoments. At one level the paper shows that whilst the discourse of PEP and the \nmedia\u201fs role in proliferating its logics helps explain much of the surgery that occurred \nin English firms, re-regulation also had a significant influence on the financialization \nof firms because it created a context in which the logics of PEP and associated \nsurgery gained legitimacy. Without the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, \nand without the Legal Services Act, the incentive for change would not have existed \nand the legitimacy of financialized models would have been harder to attain. Thus, \nfollowing Culpepper (2005), Vitols (2004) and J\u00fcrgens et al. (2000), this suggests \nthat the situated development of financial practices has to be understood as not just \na cultural-economic phenomenon tied to financial discourses but also a political-\neconomic phenomenon with timing related to broader changes in regulation that \nreflect particular situated perspectives on how firms should operate. But re-regulation \nalso needs to and does inspire situated institutional reconfigurations, in this case to \nensure that the norms and values of those running firms changed to support the \nstructural reforms associated with financialized management. This was a negotiated \nchange that was not completely successful, suggesting that the financialization of \n(law) firms, whilst a worldwide phenomenon, is taking place at place-specific \nmoments, in place-specific ways with place-specific forms of resistance that lead to \ncontinuity and change in the structure of firms.  \n \n 31 \nIt would seem, therefore, that further situated analyses of financialization, in a range \nof industries as the financialization of everything continues, will be important in the \nfuture as firms react to and emerge from the current financial crisis in place-specific \nways.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nMuch of the data reported in this paper was generated as part of research funded by \nthe Socio-Legal Studies Association.
