Deflection of the meniscus was measured using an optical fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer.\nFor long measurement integration times, interference fringe drift was a serious limitation on the detection\nrepeatability for non self-referenced measurements. Two self-referencing techniques were compared for\nmeasurements of optical absorption. The first used a simultaneous reference absorption signal at a second\nwavelength, and the second used a simultaneous volumetric modulation within the cell. Both methods have\nbeen evaluated with photothermal excitation by a 658nm LED, a 478nm LED and a UV discharge lamp. For\nthe detection of absorption in aqueous solutions, the two methods had similar performance. However, the\nvolumetric method could be used for detection of any absorbing compound, regardless of its absorption\nspectrum, and was more convenient to use.\n1 Introduction\nA closed-cell, low-frequency photothermal detector that uses a water meniscus as a sensor has been shown to\noffer highly sensitive detection of trace compounds in aqueous solution[1]. This is particularly important if low\npower light sources are to be used, such as laser diodes, LEDs and UV discharge lamps. In general,\nphotothermal signals are directly proportional to the incident light intensity[2,3]. If the signal to noise ratio of the\ndetector is to be maintained when using low incident powers, close attention must be paid to the limiting\nsources of noise in the system, because the signal is so small.\nThe water meniscus in our detector is constrained by surface forces at the top of the closed cell, where it acts as\na pressure sensor. Vertical movement of the centre of the meniscus is detected using fibre optic interferometry.\nThis approach enhances the sensitivity of the system, but has suffered from the disadvantage that the fringe\ndepth must be measured, and phase quadrature maintained, in order for the interference fringes to be\ndemodulated. Over long measurement integration times, it has been found that the interference fringes may\ndrift, resulting in a scale change in the final signal. The effect reduces the repeatability of the technique, and\nthus has acted as an important limitation when the species to be detected absorbed less than its solvent, water.\nIn particular, when detecting UV-absorbing compounds such as anthracene, the relatively high absorption\ncoefficient of water at 254nm necessitates further discrimination of the relatively small additional signal due to\nthe analyte.\n2Two self-referencing methods have been used to improve the repeatability of the photothermal system. The first\nused a second excitation beam at a longer wavelength, which was not absorbed by the analyte and could be\nmodulated at a different frequency from the main (254 nm) excitation beam. The resulting photothermal\nreference signal, expected to be due to the water background alone, was used to scale the 254nm results. This\nmethod has been previously reported in an earlier paper[4], but the results are also presented here for comparison\npurposes. In this paper, we report a further development of the photothermal technique, in which a volumetric\nreference signal is generated simultaneously with the photothermal signal. This second self-referencing method\nhas the advantage of being generally applicable to any absorbing compound, regardless of its absorption\nspectrum. Results are presented for detection of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) at 254nm and other\nexcitation wavelengths.\n2 Principle of operation\nA schematic diagram of the cell is shown in Figure 1. It employs a flat water meniscus, constrained by surface\nforces, at a small circular pinhole in nickel foil. Photothermal absorption of modulated light resulted in periodic\npressure changes in the cell, which caused the meniscus to be deflected like a thin diaphragm, its curvature\ndetermined by the excess pressure in the cell. Zero dc pressure difference across the meniscus was maintained\nby a slow hydraulic leak to an outside reservoir, which equalised internal and external pressures on a timescale\nmuch longer than the photothermal modulation period. This arrangement kept the meniscus approximately flat,\nwith small deflections from the mean position.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the photothermal cell.\nVertical movement of the centre of the meniscus was detected using fibre optic interferometry. The centre of\nthe meniscus and the cleaved end of a single-mode optical fibre formed a low finesse interference cavity, with a\ndistance of approximately 60\uf06dm maintained between the two, to prevent accidental contact. While this reduced\nthe coupling efficiency of the reflected light into the fibre, the sensitivity of the photothermal measurements\nwas not found to be affected.\n33 Theory of operation\nThe absorbed intensity I of a sample with an absorption coefficient \uf061 (in cm-1) and optical pathlength L (in cm)\nis given by Beer\u2019s law. The absorbed light intensity is;\n\uf028 \uf029LII \uf061\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d 1010 (1)\nwhere Io is the incident intensity. Following this energy absorption, the deflection of the centre of the meniscus,\n\uf044h, has been shown[1] to be equal to the following;\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06b\n\uf067\uf072\n\uf062\n8\n4aV\n1\nC4\na=\nE\nh\ncp\n2\n(2)\nE is the light energy absorbed by the fluid, \uf062 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid, Cp is its\nspecific heat capacity, \uf072 is its density, \uf067 is its surface tension, \uf06b is its bulk modulus, a is the radius of the\nmeniscus (200\uf06dm), and Vc is the volume of fluid enclosed by the cell (1.6\uf0b410-5 m3). We assume that all the\nlight absorbed by the solution is instantly converted to heat.\nDetection of meniscus deflection, \uf044h, is by fibre optic interferometry. The cleaved fibre end of the\ninterferometer and the centre of the water meniscus form a low finesse Fabry-Perot cavity, whose interference\nfringes are given by,\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf06c\n\uf070 dA 4cosvv 0 (3)\nwhere v is the voltage signal from the detector (proportional to the detected fringe intensity), d is the distance\nseparating the fibre end and the meniscus, \uf06c is the interferometer wavelength, and A is a scale factor which is to\nbe determined. At phase quadrature, the meniscus deflection may be calculated from the detected voltage\nsignals using the equation;\nA\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf064\uf064\n4\n.v=d (4)\nThe responses of all the elements of the system may be brought together and expressed as follows. The\nphotothermal response is measured as a voltage signal v from the interferometer detector according to the\nfollowing equation:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf06c\uf061\n\uf072\n\uf062\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06b\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06c \uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf044\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\n101\nC\n8\nV4\n4\nh\nh\nvv\nrms\np\n4\nc\n2\nrmsrms\nf\nI\na\na\nA\n=\nE\nE\n(5)\nThis can be written in terms of a number of possible scale factors, given as functions of those variables most\nlikely to change during or between measurements:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf06c\uf061\uf067 \uf02d\uf02d101v rmsrms f\nI\nTPRAF= (6)\nF is an interference fringe scale factor, R is a cell responsivity scale factor (dependent on the mechanical\ncompliance of the cell and the surface tension of the fluid) and P is a photothermal volume expansion factor,\nwhich is a strong function of temperature. Equation (6) can also be written as a function of a periodic volume\nchange within the cell:\n4\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 VRAF \uf044\uf067=v rms (7)\nwhere \uf044V is the volume change of the fluid, which might be photothermal in origin or be directly initiated in\nthe cell. Errors or uncertainty in any of the above scale factors would lead to measurement repeatability errors.\nIn the photothermal self-reference technique, a standard periodic photothermal signal (constant P in equation\n(6)) was applied, giving a reference signal v. In the volumetric technique, a standard periodic volumetric signal\n(constant \uf044V in equation (7)) was applied to give a second type of reference signal v. Thus, the both types of\nreference could potentially correct for changes in the interference fringe height (A), the surface tension of the\nfluid (\uf067) and changes in the mechanical compliance of the cell (also affecting R). In addition, the photothermal\nreference could also potentially correct for changes in temperature (T).\n4 Experimental\nThe system has been described in greater detail[1], but the essential characteristics are presented here. The\nstainless steel cell had a cylindrical internal bore of length 50mm and radius 10mm. The water meniscus was\nformed at a 200\uf06dm radius pinhole in nickel foil. A schematic diagram of the detection system is shown in\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of the system used for photothermal detection.\nThe full interferometer system is shown in Figure 3. Phase quadrature was maintained in the interferometer\nusing a piezoelectric bimorph element (Quantelec EB-T-320), which moved the cleaved fibre end in relation to\nthe meniscus. A feedback control circuit maintained a predetermined dc output from the interferometer receiver\nby applying a variable voltage to the bimorph, thus mechanically tracking an interference fringe edge. The\nphotodiode at (2) was connected to a transimpedance amplifier, giving a voltage signal v, which was converted\nto a displacement d using equation (4). The interferometer was used to measure the relative meniscus\ndisplacement with an rms noise floor of 10 pm Hz-1\/2.\n5Figure 3. Low finesse fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer, used to detect the relative position of the meniscus\nThree types of light sources were used for our experiments. The first was a red laser diode module (RS 194-\n004) which could be square-wave modulated with an output power of 1.4 mW rms at 678nm. The second were\ntwo visible LEDs: a blue LED (Marl 110106) emitting 0.75\uf0b10.11 mW at a peak of 478 nm, and a red LED\n(LED Technology LURR3000G3) emitting 0.88\uf0b10.13 mW at a peak of 658 nm. Each was driven at 70Hz using\na square-wave voltage from a signal generator (Thurlby Thandar TG220) with a 220\uf057 resistor in series to give\na peak drive current of 30mA. The final light source was a mercury discharge lamp (Spectronics Spectroline\n11SC-1), driven via its proprietary driver (Spectroline SCT 1A\/F), which was designed to run from a mains\ninput. Variable frequency operation was achieved by connecting the signal generator output to a power\namplifier (ILP SMOS 248), and using a transformer (RS 578-430) to provide the 240V required by the lamp\ndriver. The lamp intensity was modulated as a rectified sin wave, the majority of the modulation occurring at 2f.\nThe 2f-modulated output power was found to be 0.3 \uf0b10.05 mW rms at 254nm. Stray light was reduced by\ncovering the mercury tube with aluminium foil, apart from a 3mm hole from which light was coupled into the\ncell using a high NA lens.\nPhotothermal signals detected with an EG+G 5210 phase sensitive lock-in amplifier in \u201cf\u201d mode, or \u201c2f\u201d mode\nif the UV lamp was being used. A second lock-in amplifier was employed to detect reference signals (EG+G\n5110), differing from the first only in its upper frequency limit. Both lock-ins employed 100s integration\nperiods. The cell PZT (Morgan Matroc PZT-5A) was a 0.45mm thick, 10mm square wafer, with electrodes on\nthe two opposing faces, bonded to a 6mm diameter hole in the cell wall.\nExperiments were performed on aqueous solutions of anthracene and potassium permanganate (KMnO4).\nKMnO4 is known to be a good standard for use as a photoacoustic absorber[5], enabling our results to be\ntranslated to other compounds. The absorption of KMnO4 in each test solution was determined with a diode\narray spectrometer (HP 8452A). Measured absorption spectra of anthracene and KMnO4 are shown in Figure 4\nand Figure 5.\n6200 250 300 350 400 450\n0\n0.01\nwavelength \/ nm\nab\nso\nrp\ntio\nn\nco\nef\nf.\n\/c\nm\n-1 0.02\n500\nFigure 4.

Absorption spectrum of 5ppm KMnO4 in solution (solid line), with the normalised emission\nspectra of the blue and red LEDs superimposed (dashed lines).\nThe experimental procedure was as follows. The cell was rinsed with the solution to be tested, and then filled so\nas not to incorporate air bubbles. The interferometer fibre was roughly aligned to the centre of the meniscus, by\neye, using an xyz stage. A sinusoidal voltage of approximately 10V peak-to-peak was applied to the cell PZT in\norder to modulate the height of the centre of the meniscus. The resulting fringes from the interferometer were\ndisplayed on an oscilloscope and used to align the fibre more precisely, to the position of maximum meniscus\nmovement. Photothermal measurements were made with or without a self-reference signal, as described in more\ndetail in each of the following sections.\n5 Results\n5.1 Photothermal detection without a self-reference\nBefore measurements using this method began, a large (approximately 10Vp-p) signal was applied to the cell\nPZT, at the same frequency as the intended photothermal modulation. The resulting full height interference\nfringes were used to determine both the value of A in equation (3) and the phase quadrature setpoint. The\nmagnitude of the response to the cell PZT signal was also used to normalise the cell sensitivity. Further scaling\nwas performed to correct for the temperature dependence of \uf062 in equation (5). It was assumed that the test\nsolutions were at the laboratory temperature, which varied between 20\uf0b0C and 25\uf0b0C. The data were then\nnormalised to a temperature of 20\uf0b0C. Thus, to first order, scale factors F, R and P in equation (6) could be\napproximately determined.\n7The UV discharge lamp was used to excite photothermal signals in solutions of anthracene in deionised water.\nThe resulting measured meniscus deflections are shown in Figure 6 versus anthracene concentration in ppb by\nweight. The blue and red LEDs were used to excite similar signals in various concentrations of KMnO4, also in\ndeionised water. In this case, results have been plotted against the absorption coefficients of the solutions, to\nenable our results to be extrapolated to other compounds. At low concentrations, the signals reached a plateau\ncorresponding to the background level of water absorption; the mean measured photothermal signal for\ndeionised water is shown as a dashed line.\n(a) (b)\n10 100\nanthraceneanthracene\n[anthracene] \/ ppb\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n0 5 10 15\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.0\n[anthracene] \/ ppb\nwater\n(mean)\n254nm\nexcitation\n0.03\n0.1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n0.01\n0.1 1\nwater\n(1\uf073)\n10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-4\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\nwater\n(mean)\n0 0.001 0.002 0.003\n0\n10\n20\nwater\n(1\uf073)\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\n0.004\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1\n(a)\n478 nm\nexcitation\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1\n(b)\nKMnO4 KMnO4\n10-710-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n658nm\nexcitation\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n(a)\n0\nKMnO4\n5\uf0b410-4\nwater\n(mean)\n10-3 1.5\uf0b410-3\n0\n5\n(b)\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm KMnO4\nabsorption coefficient \/ cm-1 absorption coefficient \/ cm-1\nwater\n(1\uf073)\nFigure 6. Photothermal rms meniscus deflection excited in KMnO4 solutions by a 478nm and 658nm LED\n(as previously published [4].) and in anthracene solutions by a mercury discharge lamp. (a) Original data. (b)\nThe same data following subtraction of the mean measurement for water.\n8Further discrimination of the small additional absorption of the target compound was be obtained by\narithmetically subtracting the photothermal signal measured using a deionised water blank. This gave a linear\ndependence on concentration at low concentrations above the noise level. At 478nm, the background absorption\nof water is relatively low (1.1\uf0b410-4 cm-1 [6]), but at 658nm and 254 nm it is higher (1.4\uf0b410-3 cm-1 [6] and\n7\uf0b410-3 cm-1 [7], respectively). At these wavelengths, the measurement repeatability limited the minimum\ndetectable concentration, and can be defined as the value of one standard deviation (1\uf073) for a number of\nmeasured signals from blank deionised water samples, as also shown in Figure 6 (b). For anthracene at 254nm,\nthe limit of detection was approximately 5-10 ppb, which was significantly worse than expected. For a\nmeasurement integration period of 100s, the meniscus deflection noise of 10 pm Hz-1\/2 should give a minimum\ndetectable meniscus deflection of 1 pm, rather than the 10 pm limit that was experimentally demonstrated.\nThe repeatability of the photothermal measurements was believed to be limited by the interferometric phase\ndemodulation technique, for which it was assumed that the interference fringes remained stable over the entire\nmeasurement integration period (100s). However, it was observed that the interference fringe depth (A) could\ndrift by as much as 30% over a measurement period. The fringe depth and quadrature point were checked at the\nend of each measurement, and if found to have changed by more than approximately 10%, the measurement\nwas repeated. However, there was no means of checking the fringe stability during each measurement.\n5.2 Dual wavelength, self-referenced photothermal measurements\nAnthracene\u2019s absorption spectrum made it an ideal candidate for this self-referencing method. At 254nm, its\nabsorption coefficient is relatively high, but at much longer wavelengths its absorption is negligible compared\nto the background absorption of water. A second signal at 678nm should provide a reliable reference, whose\nmagnitude is independent of the concentration of the target compound and merely depends on the absorption of\nwater at that wavelength.\nFor dual wavelength self-referenced measurements, the experimental configuration was identical to that shown\nin Figure 2, with one important difference. Emission from two light sources (the mercury discharge lamp and\nthe 678nm laser diode described previously) was simultaneously directed into the cell, each from opposite ends.\nThe UV lamp was driven at a frequency of 2f = 115Hz as before, and the signal detected using the same lock-in\namplifier in R, \uf071 mode with a 100s time constant. A second signal generator of the same type as the first was\nused to drive the laser diode at a frequency of 70Hz. The 70Hz photothermal signal was detected using a\nsecond lock-in amplifier (EG&G 5110), which differed from the first only in its upper frequency limit (100kHz\nrather than 120kHz).\nThe photothermal response consisted of superimposed signals at the two different modulation frequencies. It\nwas important for the 678nm-excited reference signal and the 254nm-excited measurement signal to be detected\nsimultaneously, using equipment with the same filtering characteristics. Therefore, the second lock-in amplifier\nwas used in the same operational mode as the first. Cross-talk between the photothermal signals excited at the\ntwo different frequencies was established to be at or below the measurement noise level.\nAt 678nm, anthracene was expected to exhibit negligible absorption at each of the concentrations tested. The\nwater was expected to show a relatively significant and measurable level of absorption at both the excitation\nwavelengths. The measured photothermal signals (S) for low levels of absorption at 678nm and 254nm are then\ngiven by the following:\n9\uf05b \uf05d\n2\n678\n678w,678\n1\n254\n254a,254w,254\nI\nP=\nI\nP=\nf\nS\nf\nS\n\uf061\n\uf061\uf061 \uf02b\n(8)\nwhere I254 and I678 are the emitted powers of the UV lamp and the laser diode, and P is a scale factor to be\ndetermined, which depends on (a) the cell responsivity, and (b) the interference fringe height. The subscripts\n\u201cw\u201d and \u201ca\u201d denote water and anthracene, respectively.

This is\nconsistent with the measurement being limited by a minimum detectable meniscus deflection of the order of\n1pm, and is a significant improvement over the results obtained with no self-referencing, shown in Figure 6.\n0.1 1 10 100\n[anthracene] \/ ppb\n0 5 10 15\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n[anthracene] \/ ppb\n0.8\n2\n3\n(a) (b)\nwater\n(mean)\nanthracene anthracene\nwater\n(1\uf073)1\n678\n254\nS\nS\n678\n254\nR\nR\n\uf02d\n678\n254\nS\nS\nFigure 7.

A low-frequency volumetric reference signal was provided by the\ncell PZT (see Figure 1), driven by a sinusoidal voltage from a signal generator. The resulting volume\ndisplacement was proportional to the magnitude of the drive signal. This modulation was small yet consistent,\ncausing a small sinusoidal meniscus deflection that could be detected simultaneously with the photothermal\nsignals generated within the fluid (each at a different frequency). Phase sensitive detection of the photothermal\nsignal and the PZT-applied signal proceeded simultaneously, using two lock-in amplifiers, the modulation\nfrequencies chosen for maximum signal \/ noise ratio and minimum mutual cross-talk.\nThe signal applied to the cell PZT, for self-referencing purposes, was 9.48 mV rms at 90 Hz. Photothermal\nsignals were generated at 115Hz, as before. Cross-talk between the two simultaneous signals was confirmed to\nbe negligible. The phase quadrature setpoint for the fibre optic interferometer was determined in the same way\nas before, but only an approximate setting was needed in this case.\n5.3.1 Self reference calibration\nIt was desirable to find the correlation between (a) the signals resulting from a voltage applied to the cell PZT,\nand (b) the scale factors that would otherwise have been measured, namely fringe depth and cell sensitivity. The\nlatter enabled the photothermal signals, in volts, to be converted to meniscus deflection, in nm. A number of\nphotothermal experiments were performed for a variety of different interference fringe depths and laboratory\ntemperatures, measured over the usual 100s integration period. The scale factors used in section 5.2 were\nmeasured before and after each measurement, as well as the reference voltage signal resulting from the\nsimultaneous modulation of the cell PZT during the experiment. The cell PZT was found to displace the centre\nof the meniscus centre by 82\uf0b17 nm per volt applied across the PZT electrodes. For an applied voltage of\n9.48mVrms, the photoacoustic meniscus deflection may be calculated from the measured photoacoustic signals\nand the simultaneously measured cell PZT signals, as follows.\n\uf028 \uf029\nsignalPZT\nsignalPAnm07.078.0 \uf0d7\uf0b1\uf03d\uf044h (11)\nIt is useful to know the rms levels of meniscus deflection in our experiments, to compare them to the measured\ndisplacement noise of 10 pm Hz-1\/2.\nFigure 8 shows the correlation obtained between (a) the measured signal resulting from a cell PZT-applied\nvoltage 0f 9.48mVrms, and (b) the level of that signal predicted using equation (11) and the measured\ninterference fringe depth. We expect the two measurements to be equivalent, the best fit line having unit\ngradient and passing through the origin. The scatter of data points about the best-fit line can be entirely\naccounted for by possible fringe drift, which could give an error in the calculated meniscus deflection of up to\n30%, but more typically of the order of 10%, depending on the conditions.\n11\n0 2 4 6\n0\n2\n4\n6\npredicted signal \/ mV\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nd\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/m\nV\nFigure 8.

These results are shown in Figure 9, plotted as a function of the\nabsorption coefficient of KMnO4.\nFor UV absorption, this self-referencing technique appears to give a minimum detectable absorption coefficient\nthat is similar to the dual-wavelength method. At 478nm and 658nm, there is little if any performance\nimprovement compared to results which had no self-referencing. However, the data taken at 658nm appear to\nshow less scatter than the uncompensated data presented in Figure 6. The LED-excited data for self-referenced\nand uncompensated experiments were taken at the same time. Any variability, due for example to temperature\nfluctuations or interference fringe drift, should have affected both techniques, enabling a direct comparison to\nbe made.\n12\n0.03\n10-6 10-5\nKMnO4\nwater\n(1\uf073)\n10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n0.01\n0.1\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n0.005 0.01\n(a)\n0\n0.01\n0.02\nabsorption coeff \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n0.01\n0\n(b)\nKMnO4\nwater\n(mean)\n0.015\n254nm\nexcitation\n0.02\nKMnO4\n10-6\nwater\n(1\uf073)\n10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\nKMnO4\n10-3\nwater\n(mean)\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n(a) (b)\n0.002\n0\n5\n10\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\n478nm\nexcitation\n0 0.001 0.003\nKMnO4\n10-7\nwater\n(1\uf073)\n10-6\n(a) (b)\n10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\nKMnO4\n10-3\nwater\n(mean)\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/n\nm\n0 5\uf0b410-4 10-3\n0\n5\nabsorption coeff. \/ cm-1\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\n658nm\nexcitation\n1.5\uf0b410-3\nFigure 9.

(b) The same data following subtraction of the mean\nresult for a DI water control.\n13\n6 Discussion of self-referencing techniques\nWe can compare our results using the scale factor analysis of equations (6) and (7). In the absence of self-\nreferencing, scale factors F and R in equation (6) were determined by using the cell PZT to excite large\nmeniscus displacements, and measuring the full height interference fringes thus produced. However, this could\nonly be accomplished before or after the photothermal measurement, during which it was possible for the\ninterference fringes to drift, and the calculated meniscus displacement to be in error. Fringe drift has resulted in\nerrors in the calculated meniscus deflection, estimated to be between 10% and 30% for long measurement\nintegration periods. It was also possible to measure the ambient temperature during the experiment, to\ncompensate for changes in the heat capacity, density and the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid. The\nlatter, for water, has a strong dependence on temperature. However, this method of temperature compensation is\nindirect and therefore unsatisfactory.\nDual-wavelength self-referencing offers a scale factor reference signal that is excited and measured\nphotothermally. According to equation (6), it therefore provides full compensation for any possible changes in\ntemperature, mechanical compliance of the cell, solvent properties (such as surface tension) and\/or interference\nfringe drift, which might affect the photothermal response. However, its use is restricted to the detection of\ncompounds, such as anthracene, in which absorption at the reference wavelength is negligible. The reference\nsignal is used to scale the measurement, and any absorption by the analyte at the reference wavelength would\nsimply scale the reference in proportion to the signal, with no benefit.\nVolumetric self-referencing relies on a standard (periodic) volume displacement initiated directly in the cell.\nAccording to equation (7), it could therefore correct for changes in the surface tension of the fluid, the\nmechanical compliance of the cell and interference fringe drift. Because the signal was not generated\nphotothermally, a disadvantage would be that this method could not correct for changes in the temperature of\nthe fluid, which would affect the thermal expansion coefficient, \uf062. However, it could be used to detect analytes\nwith any absorption spectrum, and could therefore be used to detect KMnO4 in water with a high degree of\nrepeatability.\nBoth methods of self-referencing have improved the measurement repeatability of the photothermal detector.\nHowever, neither method can entirely compensate for scaling errors introduced by the interferometer. In both\nmethods, the reference signal is generated at a different frequency to the photothermal signal. It is always\npossible that the effect of noise or of a transient fringe drift could be different at each of the two frequencies.\nNevertheless, we have found experimentally that fringe drift, the main factor responsible for repeatability\nerrors, tends to occur at much lower frequencies and hence should affect measurements at both the signal and\nreference frequencies in substantially the same way. Both techniques were therefore able to provide improved\nperformance compared to the case where no reference was used.\n7 Conclusion\nIn our photothermal detector, a water meniscus is used as a pressure sensor, whose periodic deflection is\nmeasured using an optical fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer. Interference fringe drift has been found to limit the\nrepeatability of measurements over long integration periods. This becomes significant when detecting\nabsorption changes at or below the level of the background absorption due to water, and small additional\nabsorption coefficients are discerned by subtraction of a blank reference signal from a control sample.\nTwo different self-referencing methods have been presented, which have improved the repeatability of\n14\nphotothermal measurements. In both techniques, a second signal was generated at a different modulation\nfrequency from the photothermal signal, and detected simultaneously. The first technique employed a second\nreference wavelength to give a photothermal reference, correcting for any variations in the overall responsivity\nof the system. However, its use relied on the availability of a light source emitting a wavelength that was not\nabsorbed by the analyte. The second self-referencing technique made use of a standard volumetric modulation\nin the photothermal cell, applied using a piezoelectric transducer. This new method had the advantage of\ngreater convenience and could be used with any analyte, regardless of its absorption spectrum.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported by North West Water Ltd and by the EPSRC \/ Department of Trade and Industry in\nthe UK, through the Teaching Company Scheme.\nReferences\n1 J.
