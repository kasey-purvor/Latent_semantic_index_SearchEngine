Some chaotic properties of a classical particle interacting with a time-\ndependent double-square-well potential are studied. The dynamics of the system\nis characterised using a two-dimensional nonlinear area-preserving map. Scaling\narguments are used to study the chaotic sea in the low energy domain.

Introduction\nThe dynamics of systems interacting with time-dependent potentials has received close\nattention in theoretical and experimental physics over many years. In quantum systems,\none interesting question is the tunnelling time through a potential barrier [1]. It is well\nknown that it depends on the energy of the particle and the height of the potential,\nbut the situation becomes much more complicated [2] when the height of the barrier is\ntime-dependent. Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to understand such\nsystems, including numerical studies of the transmission probability spectrum in a\ndriven triple diode in the presence of a periodic external field [3], photon-assisted\ntunnelling through a GaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs quantum dot induced by a microwave external\nfrequency [4], sequential tunnelling in a superlattice induced by an intense electric field\n[5], transmission above a quantum well considering the effect of possible capture into a\nbound state in the well due to dissipation [6], and the probability of tunnelling in the\npresence of friction in Josephson junction circuits [7].\nFor a classical particle interacting with a time-dependent barrier some notable\nresults are presented in [8, 9]. The main result of these latter papers is that the traversal\ntime, i.e. the length of time that the particle spends before crossing the barrier obeys a\npower law. This is a good indication of sensitivity to initial conditions. The problem of a\nparticle interacting with one, two and finally an infinite chain of synchronised oscillating\nsquare wells was studied in [10]. The authors showed that, for one oscillating well, the\nparticle is not chaotically scattered since topological chaos is not observed for such a\ncase but that chaotic scattering is, however, observed for two oscillating wells. For the\nPublished in J. Phys. A Math. Gen.37, 8949-8968 (2004).\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 2\ncase of an infinite chain of oscillating square wells they showed that, although there\nis an intricate and complex dynamics, a chaotic orbit does not have unlimited energy\ngain. This is closely related to the fact that the phase space presents invariant spanning\ncurves. A different version of this problem considering a classical particle interacting\nwith an infinite box of potential that contains one oscillating square well was discussed in\n[11] using a formalism that could be interpreted as equivalent to studying the problem of\na particle interacting with an oscillating square well with periodic boundary conditions;\nit could also be applied to the problem of an infinite chain of oscillating square wells.\nThe authors found an abrupt transition in the Lyapunov exponent and suggested that it\nwas due to destruction of the first invariant spanning curve and the consequent merging\nof different large chaotic regions.\nIt is also interesting to study problems where a classical particle interacts with a\nstatic or time-dependent multi-well potential in the presence of noise. Recent results\ninclude exact solutions for the problem of diffusion within static single and double\nsquare wells [12, 13], an introduction of external fields for a two-level system in a classical\npotential [14], a general solution of the problem of activated escape in periodically-driven\nsystems [15], analytical solutions for the problem of a piecewise bistable potential in\nthe limit of low external perturbation [16], the escape flux from a multi-well metastable\npotential preceding of the formation of quasi-equilibrium [17], activation over a randomly\nfluctuating barrier [18, 19], diffusion across a randomly fluctuating barrier [20] and\ndiffusion of a particle in a piecewise potential in the presence of small fluctuations of the\nbarriers [21]. The main result of this latter paper is that the flux of particle through the\nbarrier may either increase or decrease, a result that is independent of the frequency of\nthe oscillations.\nThe well known billiards problems are closely related. They consist basically\nof quantum or classical particles confined within closed boundaries with which they\nundergo elastic collisions [22, 23, 24, 25, 26], producing a variety of behaviours.\nDepending on the boundary and the control parameters, as well as on the initial\nconditions, it is possible to observe integrability, non-integrability, and ergodicity. The\nmain question with a time-dependent boundary is whether or not the system exhibits\nthe phenomenon of Fermi acceleration [27]. A more detailed discussion of this very\ninteresting question together with specific examples can be found in Ref. [28] where\nthe authors proposed the following conjecture: \u201cchaotic dynamics of a billiard with\nfixed boundary is a sufficient condition for the Fermi acceleration in the system when a\nboundary perturbation is introduced\u201d.\nIn this paper we study the problem of a particle within an infinite box of potential\nthat contain two oscillating square wells. We will concentrate on the problem of non-\nsynchronised oscillation, although some results for the synchronised case will also be\ndiscussed. The dynamics of this problem is analysed using a two-dimensional nonlinear\narea-preserving map in energy and time variables. We focus our attention on the chaotic\nlow energy domain, characterising it by use of Lyapunov exponents. We also derive a\nscaling relation for the variance of the average energy in the chaotic sea at low energy.\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 3\nDepending on the energy, the particle may stay trapped in one well for some interval\nof time. We show that the time that the particle remains trapped in the well, also\ncalled the reflection time, obeys a distribution fitted by a power law that has the same\nexponent for both wells. This distribution is observed only for chaotic orbits located\nbelow the first invariant spanning curve. In a similar way, we have observed that for\nvery specific values of the energy, the particle can exhibit the phenomenon of resonance\nin which it exits the well with the same energy as it had on entry. As we will see, the\nintroduction of random fluctuations in the depths of one or both wells confers unlimited\nenergy growth on the particle.\nThe paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we describe in full detail all the steps\nused to construct the map. We present in Sec. 3 our results for the deterministic version\nof this problem, while Sec. 4 discusses the stochastic model. Finally, we summarise and\nand make our concluding remarks in Sec. 5.\n2. The model with periodic oscillations\nWe consider the problem of a classical particle moving inside an infinite box of potential\nthat contains two oscillating square wells. It could be related directly to mesoscopic\nsystems [3] with time-dependent potentials [3, 6] with the square wells representing the\nconduction band for a heterostructure of GaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs while the time-dependent\npotential could represent the electron-phonon interaction [29]. Furthermore, the\nformalism used to derive the scaling relation for the chaotic low energy region in\nthis problem could be very useful and directly applicable to billiards problems. Such\nformalism was recently applied to the careful investigation of the chaotic sea in the\nFermi-Ulam accelerator model [30].\nThe problem relates to a typical one-dimensional system and may be described\nusing the Hamiltonian H(x, p, t) = p2\/2m+V (x, t). Here V (x, t) describes the potential\nwithin which the particle must remain, which can be written as\nV (x, t) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u221e if x \u2264 0 and x \u2265 l + a + L\nd1 sin(\u03c91t) if 0 < x < l\nV0 if l \u2264 x \u2264 l + a\nd2 sin(\u03c92t) if l + a < x < l + a + L\nwhere d1 and d2 are the amplitudes of oscillation of wells I and II respectively, l\nand L are their widths and a is the width of the constant potential V0. Each well\noscillates independently with its own frequency, \u03c91 or \u03c92. The potential V (x, t) is\nshown schematically in Fig. 1. We choose to describe the dynamics of this problem\nusing a map T that gives, respectively, the new total energy and the corresponding time\nwhen the particle enters well I, i.e. (En+1, tn+1) = T (En, tn). Although it is explicit that\nthe Hamiltonian is time-dependent and the energy of the particle is not constant, we\nwill show that the map describing the dynamics of this system is area-preserving.\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 4\n2d1 2d2\nl a L\nV0\nI II\nFigure 1. Sketch of the potential V (x, t). The zero of x is in the bottom left-hand\ncorner.\n2.1. Map derivation\nWe now describe in detail the steps used in construction of the map. We adopt the same\ngeneral procedures [9] recently applied [31] to the problem of a time modulated barrier.\nSuppose that the particle is at x = l travelling to the left with total energy En = Kn+V0\nat time t = tn. As it enters well I, it experiences an abrupt change in its kinetic energy,\nand the new value is given by K \u2032n = En\u2212 d1 sin(\u03c91tn). Inside well I, the particle travels\nwith constant velocity v\u2032n =\n\u221a\n2[En \u2212 d1 sin(\u03c91tn)]\/m because there are no potential\ngradients. It undergoes an elastic collision with the wall at x = 0, and is reflected back.\nThe time taken by the particle in travelling the distance 2l is t\u2032n = 2l\/v\n\u2032\nn. When it arrives\nat x = l again, it will escape from well I only if E \u2032n = K\n\u2032\nn + d1 sin[\u03c91(tn + t\n\u2032\nn)] > V0. If\nE \u2032n \u2264 V0, the particle is reflected inside well I, travels the distance 2l again, and so on.\nIt will escape from well I only when the following condition is satisfied\nE \u2032n = K\n\u2032\nn + d1 sin[\u03c91(tn + it\n\u2032\nn)] > V0 . (1)\nHere, i is the smallest integer number that makes equation (1) true. When the\nparticle escapes from well I, it again experiences an abrupt change in its kinetic\nenergy, which becomes K \u2032\u2032n = E\n\u2032\nn \u2212 V0. The particle then travels above the barrier\nwith a constant velocity v\u2032\u2032n =\n\u221a\n2K \u2032\u2032n\/m until it reaches the entrance to well II. The\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 5\ntime spent in this way above the barrier is t\u2032\u2032n = a\/v\n\u2032\u2032\nn. On entry to well II, the\nparticle again suffers an abrupt change in its kinetic energy and the new relation is\nK \u2032\u2032\u2032n = E\n\u2032\nn \u2212 d2 sin[\u03c92(tn + it\u2032n + t\u2032\u2032n)]. The velocity of the particle inside the well II is\nv\u2032\u2032\u2032n =\n\u221a\n2K \u2032\u2032\u2032n \/m. When it reaches the right hand wall at x = l+a+L, it experiences an\nelastic collision and is reflected backwards at same velocity. So the time spent by the\nparticle in travelling the distance 2L is t\u2032\u2032\u2032n = 2L\/v\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn . The particle will escape from well\nII if En+1 = K\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn + d2 sin[\u03c92(tn + it\n\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn )] > V0. But if En+1 \u2264 V0, the particle will\nbe reflected again inside well II, travel the distance L and, after suffering another elastic\ncollision, will be reflected back again. It will escape from well II only if the following\ncondition is fulfilled\nEn+1 = K\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn + d2 sin[\u03c92(tn + it\n\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\nn + jt\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn )] > V0 , (2)\nwhere j is the smallest integer for which equation (2) is true. Escaping from well\nII, the particle travels the distance a with velocity v\u2032vn =\n\u221a\n2(En+1 \u2212 V0)\/m in time\nt\u2032v = a\/v\u2032v until reaches the entrance of well I. The total time thus expended is\ntn+1 = tn + it\n\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\nn + jt\n\u2032\u2032\u2032 + t\u2032v, so that the map T can be written as\nT :\n{\nEn+1 = K\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn + d2 sin[\u03c92(tn + it\n\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\nn + jt\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn )]\ntn+1 = tn + it\n\u2032\nn + t\n\u2032\u2032\nn + jt\n\u2032\u2032\u2032 + t\u2032v\n. (3)\nBecause of the way in which the map was derived, there are an excessive number of\ncontrol parameters, 8 in total, including l, L, a, \u03c91, \u03c92, d1, d2 and V0. It is much more\nconvenient to rewrite the map (3) in terms of dimensionless parameters, retaining only\nthose that are relevant and effective. We use both normalised energy en = En\/V0 and\nnormalised amplitudes \u03b41 = d1\/V0 and \u03b42 = d2\/V0 of oscillation of the bottoms of the\nwells. A practical measure of time could be by counting the number of oscillations of\nwell I, so that we can define the phase \u03c6n = \u03c91tn. We define the ratio of the frequencies\nas r = \u03c92\/\u03c91. It is also interesting to define the following parameter,\nNc =\n\u221a\nm\n2V0\n2l\n\u03c41\n, (4)\nwhere \u03c41 = 2\u03c0\/\u03c91 is the oscillation period of well I. The parameter Nc then gives us the\nnumber of oscillations of well I during the length of time in which the particle travels\ndistance 2l inside it at constant kinetic energy K = V0, in the absence of oscillations.\nUsing these new variables, the map T can be rewritten as\nT :\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\nen+1 = en \u2212 \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n) + \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a)\n\u2212 \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b)]\n+ \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b + j\u0394\u03c6c)]\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b + j\u0394\u03c6c + \u0394\u03c6d\n, (5)\nwhere the auxiliary variables are given by\n\u0394\u03c6a =\n2\u03c0Nc\u221a\nen \u2212 \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n)\n, \u0394\u03c6b =\na\nl\n\u03c0Nc\u221a\ne\u2032n \u2212 1\n,\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 6\n\u0394\u03c6c =\nL\nl\n2\u03c0Nc\u221a\ne\u2032n \u2212 \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b)]\n,\n\u0394\u03c6d =\na\nl\n\u03c0Nc\u221a\nen+1 \u2212 1 ,\ni is the smallest integer for which equation (6) is true,\ne\u2032n = en \u2212 \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n) + \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a) > 1 , (6)\nand j is the smallest integer number for which equation (7) is true,\nen+1 = e\n\u2032\nn \u2212 \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b)]\n+ \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b + j\u0394\u03c6c)] > 1 . (7)\nThis map is area-preserving because it possesses the property that detJ = 1, where J\nis its Jacobian matrix. Using these variables the map now has six dimensionless and\neffective control parameters namely \u03b41, \u03b42, Nc, r, a\/l and L\/l.\nThe case of synchronised oscillations (r = 1) of equal amplitude (\u03b41 = \u03b42) for\nsymmetrical wells (L\/l = 1) has already been studied [10, 11]. For the special case\nwhere the driving is also in-phase, the system must be related to the problem of a time-\nmodulated barrier [8, 9] (see also [31] for recent results) because the relative movement\nof the different parts of the potential is then identical. As we will see, however, it is also\nof interest to investigate the dynamical properties in the more general cases that arise\nwhere the oscillations may be of unequal amplitude, not necessarily synchronised, and\nwhere the wells may be asymmetrical as well as symmetrical.\n3. Numerical results\nWe now present and discuss our numerical results for the model defined in Sec. 2.\nThe first step is choose appropriate control parameters and to start investigating the\ncorresponding dynamical properties. We will consider first the symmetrical case and\nthen, secondly, the asymmetrical one.\n3.1. The symmetrical case\nThe symmetrical case consists basically in analysing the system specified by a\/l = L\/l =\n1, such that each well and the barrier (see Fig. 1) are of the same width. Before choosing\nthe value of the control parameter Nc, let us first discuss its physical significance. As\noriginally defined (see eq. (4)), it gives information about the frequency of oscillation\nof well I, and we can rewrite it in a more appropriate form as Nc = tc\/\u03c41. The time\ntc = 2l\n\u221a\nm\/(2V0) gives the interval within which the particle travels the distance 2l with\nkinetic energy K = V0. Related to this time, we can define a characteristic frequency\n\u03c9c = 2\u03c0\/tc. Using such a relation, and a similar one for the period \u03c41, the control\nparameter Nc can be written as Nc = \u03c91\/\u03c9c. In this section, we will consider Nc = G\nwith G = (\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1)\/2, sometimes referred to as the golden mean [32].

Having defined the control parameters, we now\nconstruct the phase space for this model. Fig. 2 shows the phase spaces for (a) r = 2\nand (b) r = 3 with a fixed amplitude of oscillation \u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25. They exhibit a\nvery rich hierarchy of behaviours including KAM islands, invariant spanning curves and\nchaotic seas. We also see that variation of the control parameter r influences the shape\nof the phase space directly, changing the positions of the invariant spanning curves and\nKAM islands. An immediate consequence is that the shape of the chaotic sea is also\nmodified. We will use Lyapunov exponent to characterise the chaotic sea.\nIt is well known that the Lyapunov exponent quantifies the average exponential\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 8\n0 1.5e+08 3e+08 4.5e+08\nn\n0.7\n0.725\n0.75\n0.775\n\u03bb\n0 1.5e+08 3e+08 4.5e+08\nn\n0.78\n0.81\n0.84\n0.87\n\u03bb\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.

In order to calculate the eigenvalues of M , we use the\nfact that J can be written as the product J = \u0398T , where \u0398 is an orthogonal matrix\nand T is a triangular one. We now define the elements of these matrices as\n\u0398 =\n(\ncos(\u03b8) \u2212 sin(\u03b8)\nsin(\u03b8) cos(\u03b8)\n)\n, T =\n(\nT11 T12\n0 T22\n)\n.\nIntroducing the identity operator, we rewrite M = JnJn\u22121 . . . J2\u03981\u0398\u221211 J1, and thus\ndefine \u0398\u221211 J1 = T1. The product J2\u03981 defines a new matrix J\n\u2217\n2 . As a next step, we\nmay then write M = JnJn\u22121 . . .

Fig. 3 shows the convergence of the positive Lyapunov exponent from 5\ndifferent initial conditions for the chaotic low energy regions shown in Fig. 2. Each\ninitial condition was iterated 5\u00d7 108 times to guarantee that the asymptotic value has\nbeen reached. The ensemble average of the five samples is: (a) \u03bb = 0.733 \u00b1 0.001\nand (b) \u03bb = 0.831 \u00b1 0.002. We also obtain the behaviour of the positive Lyapunov\nexponent for the chaotic low energy region as function of r, as shown in Fig. 4 for\ncontrol parameters a\/l = L\/l = 1, Nc = G and \u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25. Because of the change\nin the shape of the chaotic sea caused by variation of r, and in particular the position of\nthe first invariant spanning curve, the asymptotic convergence of the positive Lyapunov\nexponent requires progressively longer runs in order to approach its asymptotic value\nas r increases. Equivalently, with a fixed maximum iteration number nmax = 5 \u00d7 108,\nthe error bars for large values of r are bigger than for those for small r.\nLet now us discuss some scaling properties for this model in the region related to\nthe chaotic sea. We choose to characterise the behaviour in terms of the variance of the\naverage energy, which we will refer to it as the roughness \u03c9 [34]. The procedure adopted\nhere has already been used to characterise the chaotic low energy region of the Fermi-\nUlam accelerator model [30] and to investigate scaling present in the chaotic sea for a\ntime-modulated barrier [31]. Given the large number of control parameters present in\nthis model, we will shall consider the following parameters to be fixed: a\/l = L\/l = 1;\n\u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25; r = G (unsynchronised case). We then study the behaviour of the\nroughness as function of the parameter Nc. To define the roughness we must first\nconsider the average of the energy over the orbit generated from one initial condition\ne(n,Nc) =\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=0\nei , (8)\nand then evaluate the interface width around this average energy. We can thus define\nthe roughness formally, considering an ensemble of B different initial conditions, as\n\u03c9(n,Nc) \u2261 1\nB\nB\u2211\nj=1\n(\u221a\ne2j(n,Nc)\u2212 e2j(n,Nc)\n)\n. (9)\nAn ensemble of initial conditions is used to smooth the roughness evolution, for which\na typical curve is shown in Fig. 5(a); it was constructed by fixing the initial energy at\ne0 = 1.001 and then ensemble-averaging 5, 000 different initial phases in the interval\n\u03c60 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), all of which gave rise to chaotic behaviour. The main idea of averaging\nover the initial phases is to analyse the asymptotic dynamics starting for the same initial\nenergy, but considering a large number (in principle) of allowed positions to the bottom\nof well I. We can see in Fig. 5(a) that there are two different regimes of behaviour. After\na very brief initial transient, the roughness grows according to a power law and then, as\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 11\n1 100 10000 1e+06\nn\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n\u03c9\n1.002e-07 1.005e-07\n1\/n\n91.22\n91.24\n91.26\n\u03c9\nNumerical Data\nLinear fit\na\nb\nn\nxI\nII\n\u03b2\nFigure 5.

(b)\nProcedure used to extrapolate the roughness after application of the transformation\nn\u2192 1\/n. The values of control parameters were a\/l = L\/l = 1, \u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25, r = G\nand Nc = 3000.\nthe iteration number increases, the roughness eventually bends towards the direction of\na saturation regime that is obtained only for long enough iteration number (see below\nthe details used to extrapolate the saturation of the roughness). The changeover from\ngrowth to convergence on saturation is characterised by a crossover iteration number\nnx. It is well known that the chaotic sea is limited by the first invariant spanning\ncurve which, in a sense, plays the role of a boundary limiting the size of the chaotic\nsea. It is as an immediate consequence of this limitation that the roughness saturates.\nAs the control parameter Nc increases, however, the position of the first invariant\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 12\nspanning curve changes. For the range of Nc over which we will investigate scaling\nin the roughness, an increase in Nc implies a rise in the position of the first invariant\nspanning curve so that, as a consequence, the roughness saturates at a higher value. We\ncan then start to characterise the roughness scaling, supposing that:\n(i) After the brief initial transient, the roughness grows as function of iteration number\naccording to\n\u03c9(n,Nc) \u221d n\u03b2. (10)\nThis growth can be seen in region I of Fig. 5. \u03b2 is called the growth exponent.\nEquation (10) is valid for n\n nx.\n(ii) As the iteration number increases, the roughness reaches saturation, as can be seen\nin region II of Fig. 5. The behaviour of the roughness within the saturation regime\nfollows the equation\n\u03c9sat(Nc) \u221d N\u03b1c , (11)\nwhere \u03b1 is the roughening exponent. Equation (11) is only valid for n\u000b nx.\n(iii) The crossover iteration number nx that tells us when the roughness growth slows\nand saturation is being approached is given by\nnx(Nc) \u221d N zc (12)\nwhere z is called the dynamical exponent.\nWe now summarise the procedure adopted to obtain the saturation value. Even for our\nmaximum iteration number (n \u2248 500nx), we can see from the numerical simulations that\ngrowth of the roughness has not quite reached saturation. But if we choose to increase\nthe maximum iteration number even more, this carries the disadvantage of leading to\nvery much longer simulations. We therefore take the option of finding the saturation\nvalue by extrapolation. We apply the transformation n\u2192 1\/n for the iteration number,\nwhich is applicable because the saturation grows slowly and linearly for sufficiently large\nvalues of n, yielding\n\u03c9(n,Nc) = \u03c9sat(Nc) +\nconst.\nn\n. (13)\nConsidering the case of n \u2192 \u221e, it is easy to see that Eq. (13) gives us that\n\u03c9(n,Nc) \u2192 \u03c9sat(Nc), which may be obtained after doing a linear fit to the results.\nThe procedure is illustrated in Fig. 5(b).\nNext we discuss how to obtain the exponents \u03b1 and z. The intercept of the power\nlaw (see Fig. 5(a)) with the linear coefficient obtained from Eq. (13) gives the crossover\niteration number nx. The exponents \u03b1 and z are then obtained from the graphs of n(Nc)\nand \u03c9sat(Nc) as shown in Fig. 6. Applying the power law fit, we find that \u03b1 = 0.632(5)\nand z = 1.26(1). Obtaining \u03b2 by averaging over all curves in the range of Fig. 6, we\nfind \u03b2 = 0.500(2).\nHaving found the exponents, we can then proceed to collapse the roughness curves\nonto a universal plot. As the first step, we take the ratio \u03c9(Nc)\/\u03c9sat(Nc).

The second\nstep is to relocate all the curves to the same crossover iteration number, which is done\nby taking the ratio n\/nx as shown in Fig. 7(c).\nThe success of this procedure for obtaining a universal plot for the roughness allows\nus to describe it using the following scaling function\n\u03c9(n,Nc) = \u03b6\u03c9(\u03b6\nbn, \u03b6cNc) , (14)\nwhere \u03b6 is the scaling factor. We can then choose \u03b6 = n\u2212\n1\nb and rewrite Eq.

The asymmetrical case\nWe now discuss a resonance phenomenon that manifests in the chaotic sea. It depends\nspecifically on the energy of the particle immediately after it enters a well, and it may\noccur in either of the wells (see also Ref. [31] for a fuller discussion of resonances in the\nproblem of a time modulated barrier). Entering the well, the corresponding range of\nenergy where the resonance can take place is: (a) well I, e \u2208 [eImin, eImax] and (b) well II,\ne \u2208 [eIImin, eIImax] where eImin = 1\u2212 \u03b41, eImax = 1+ \u03b41, eIImin = 1\u2212 \u03b42 and eIImax = 1+ \u03b42. The\nresonances can be determined directly from the length of time that the particle spends\ntravelling inside each well. For well I, this time is\n\u0394\u03c6a =\n2\u03c0Nc\u221a\nen \u2212 \u03b41 sin(\u03c6n)\n,\nand for well II it is\n\u0394\u03c6c =\nL\nl\n2\u03c0Nc\u221a\ne\u2032n \u2212 \u03b42 sin[r(\u03c6n + i\u0394\u03c6a + \u0394\u03c6b)]\n.\nIf either of these times is a multiple of 2\u03c0, the particle will not remain trapped within\nthe corresponding well. From the range of energy within the relevant well, we can\nestimate the number of oscillations, the resonance energy, and the time of flight. The\ncorresponding maximum and minimum values for the number of oscillations are given\nby: (a) well I, kImax = Nc\/\n\u221a\neImin and k\nI\nmin = Nc\/\n\u221a\neImax; (b) well II, k\nII\nmax =\nL\nl\nNc\u221a\neIImin\nand\nkIImin =\nL\nl\nNc\u221a\neIImax\n. After obtaining the range of k values, the respective resonance energies\nfor the two wells II are\neIk =\nN2c\nk2\n, eIIk =\n(\nL\nl\n)2 N2c\nk2\n.\nTo illustrate the occurrence of such resonances, we choose to characterise the\nsynchronised case (r = 1) and asymmetric case a\/l = 1, L\/l = 2.5 by different\namplitudes of oscillation, \u03b41 = 0.25, \u03b42 = 0.35 for Nc = 15G.

It is also expected that near to\nthe resonance energies, the probability of observing a successive reflection inside the\nwell, i.e. sufficient condition for the particle to stay temporally trapped, should be quite\nlow. To provide evidence of such behaviour, we obtained numerically the distribution of\nsuccessive reflections energies as shown in Fig. 8. We stress that, exactly at resonance,\nthe particle has zero probability of being trapped in the well; the corresponding energies\nare indicated in Fig. 8.

We now consider this case.\nWe discussed in Sec. 2 how, depending on the energy of the particle as it\nenters the well, it can stay trapped there while suffering successive reflections. After\nsome interval of time, however, after satisfying some specific conditions, it will exit\nthe well, and evolve inside the system (mainly in chaotic behaviour) until it again\nbecomes trapped, not necessarily in the same well. In this way, we can characterise\nthe distribution of successive reflections as well as the length of time during which\nthe particle stays trapped in the well. It is expected that very long times (i.e. large\nnumber of successive reflections) should be observed less commonly than short times\n(small numbers of successive reflections). To characterise such behaviour, we choose the\nfollowing combination of control parameters: the asymmetric case (a\/l = 10), (L\/l = 3)\nconsidering non-synchronised oscillations (r = G and Nc = 15G) of differing amplitude\n\u03b41 = 0.25 and \u03b42 = 0.35. Fig. 9 shows the distributions of successive reflections, Pn,\nand corresponding successive reflection times, Pt, for well I (a similar result is in fact\nalso observed for well II). The analysis of Fig. 9 allows us to describe such distributions\nas Pn \u221d t\u03b3n and Pt \u221d t\u03b3t . After performing a power law fit, we obtain for well I that:\n\u03b3n = \u22122.99(1) and \u03b3t = \u22123.00(2). A similar analysis for well II yields \u03b3n = \u22123.00(1)\nand \u03b3t = \u22123.01(1). So, we can conclude that \u03b3n = \u03b3t \u2248 \u22123. It is of interest that such an\nexponent value has also been reported for other, different, one-dimensional models, so\nthat these results may be an indicative of some kind of universality.

Behaviour of the average energy as function of (a) iteration number n\nand (b) average time t\u00af for the case where f1(t) is random and f2(t) is periodic. The\ncontrol parameters used were Nc = r = G, \u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25, a\/l = L\/l = 1. A power\nlaw fit gives that \u03b4n = 0.498(3) and \u03b4t = 0.647(2).\ninitial condition is sufficient to provide evidence for such growth, averaging over an\nensemble of initial conditions makes the energy curve smoother and much easier to\ncharacterise. Fig. 10 shows the behaviour of e\u00af(n) and e\u00af(t\u00af). The control parameters used\nwere a\/l = L\/l = 1, r = G, \u03b41 = \u03b42 = 0.25 and Nc = G. Similar results can be obtained\nfor other combinations of control parameters. We use an ensemble of 10, 000 different\ninitial conditions, starting with an initial energy e0 = 1.001 and different initial seeds\nfor the random number generator. Each initial condition was iterated 107 times. The\nanalysis of Fig. 10 allow us to describe the growth of the energy as: (a) e\u00af \u221d n\u03b4n and (b)\ne\u00af \u221d t\u00af\u03b4t . Considering the case in which well I behaves randomly while well II is periodic,\nDynamical properties of a particle in a time-dependent double-well potential 21\nour results shows that \u03b4n = 0.498(3) and \u03b4t = 0.647(2) (as in Fig. 10). For the case\nwhere well I is periodic and well II behaves randomly, we obtain that \u03b4n = 0.496(4)\nand \u03b4t = 0.644(7). Finally, considering the case where both wells behaves randomly, a\npower law fit gives \u03b4n = 0.497(4) and \u03b4t = 0.648(3). We can see that both exponents are\nrobust, in the sense that they are independent of which well (I, or II, or both) is behaving\nrandomly. The averages of the latter three exponents are given by \u03b4\u00afn = 0.497(4) and\n\u03b4\u00aft = 0.646(4). It is especially gratifyingly that the exponent \u03b4\u00afn has the same value as\nthat obtained from a random walk, given that the dynamics is essentially the same. In\nan attempt to account for the difference between the exponents \u03b4\u00afn and \u03b4\u00aft we point out\nthat, during a given interval, a particle with high energy can iterate many more times\nwithin a well than a particle with low energy. The authors of [28] conjectured that\nFermi acceleration should be observed for a billiard with a time-dependent boundary if\nthe corresponding version for a fixed boundary presents chaotic components. However,\nwe can conclude that for the system studied in the present paper (see also [11] and\n[31] for comparable results in other systems) which exhibits chaotic behaviour under a\ntime-dependent (periodic) perturbation, Fermi acceleration is observed only after the\nintroduction of random (stochastic) motion to the time dependent potential.\n5. Final remarks and conclusions\nWe have studied the problem of a classical particle inside an infinite box of potential that\ncontains two time-dependent square wells. We describe this problem via the formalism\nof a discrete map, considering two types of time dependence: (i) periodic and (ii)\nstochastic. For the periodic dependence we discuss results for both the symmetrical\nand asymmetrical cases, as well as for both the synchronised and unsynchronised cases.\nWe concentrate on the chaotic low energy region, which we characterise in terms of\nLyapunov exponents. We derive a scaling relation for the variance of the average velocity\n(roughness) and show that the critical exponents obeys an analytic relationship. In the\nlow energy region, the particle may stay temporarily trapped in the time-dependent well.\nWe shown that the distributions of successive reflection numbers and successive reflection\ntimes obey power laws with the same exponent. The particle may also experience the\nphenomenon of resonance, i.e. it may exit the well with same energy as it had when it\nentered. For the case in which one or both wells move randomly, we have shown that\nthe particle exhibits growth in velocity and correspondingly in kinetic energy. Such\nbehaviour is clear evidence of the Fermi acceleration phenomenon.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u00b4\u0131fico CNPq, Brazilian agency.
