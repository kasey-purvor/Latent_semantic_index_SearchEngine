But the reform of incapacity \nbenefit signifies a dangerous political shift in \nhow chronically ill and disabled patients are \nseen as either \u201cdeserving\u201d or \u201cundeserving\u201d \nof state support. Such a shift will have \nimportant implications for the health \nprofessionals involved.\nIncapacity benefit, the main social security \ncash benefit that isn\u2019t means tested, is paid \nto 2.7 million people in the UK. Recipients, \nwho need to have contributed sufficient \nnational insurance payments, are assessed as \nbeing incapable of work because of illness \nor disability, initially by a GP and after six \nmonths by a Benefits Agency doctor. There \nare two short term rates: \na lower rate paid for the \nfirst 28 weeks of sickness \n(currently \u00a363.75 (\u20ac80; \n$120) a week) and a \nhigher rate for weeks 29 \nto 52 (\u00a375.40 a week). A \nlong term rate (\u00a384.50 a \nweek) applies to people \nwho have been sick for more than a year and \naccounts for the largest number of claimants. \nParticipation in employability programmes is \nvoluntary for claimants of incapacity benefit.\nThe new employment support allowance \nwill comprise a two tier system of benefits in \nwhich all are entitled to a basic benefit (paid \nat the same rate as job seeker\u2019s allowance: \n\u00a360.50 a week). However, people who are \njudged (on a medically administered \u201cwork \ncapability\u201d test) to be unable to work or \nwith limited capacity for work will receive a \nhigher level of benefit (\u201csupport allowance,\u201d \nsimilar to incapacity benefit) with no \nconditions. Those who are deemed \u201csick but \nable to work\u201d would receive an \u201cemployment \nsupport\u201d component only if they participated \nin employability initiatives such as Pathways \nto Work.\nThe introduction of the two tiered \nemployment support allowance means that \nfor the first time in the UK conditionality \napplies to the receipt of sickness related \nbenefits. However, it is in keeping with \nthe reform of other UK benefits (such as \nunemployment benefit) and changes to \nsickness absence benefits elsewhere in \nEurope. Generally such reforms are sold as \na way to reintroduce recipients to the labour \nmarket or to provide an incentive for people \nto look for and return to work\u2014although \nthere is no evidence of their effectiveness. \nHowever, the reforms also need to be \nunderstood in the context of the political \ndebate about the relation between incapacity \nbenefit, health, and employment.\nIncapacity benefit has long been criticised \nas providing a means of avoiding work \nand as a mechanism whereby levels of \nunemployment are hidden. Despite evidence \nthat medically certified sickness absence \n(including incapacity benefit) is actually \na good indicator of health and mortality, \npolitical and media debates are dominated \nby the view that incapacity benefit is a \ndisincentive to work and that people with \ngood health choose to fake sickness to receive \nit. The discourse around \u201cfake\u201d claimants \n(usually people with a diagnosis of a mental \nhealth problem) has popularised the view \nthat some types of illness, and therefore some \npatients, are less deserving of state support \nthan others. Such concerns are reflected \nin the employment support allowance\u2019s \nseparation of health based claims into two \ndistinct categories: people considered sick but \nable to work (undeserving poor) will receive \nlower levels of benefit unless they participate \nin compulsory employability programmes, \nwhereas those considered to have a more \nsevere illness or disability (deserving poor) \nwill receive a higher rate of unconditional \nbenefit.\nSickness related benefits are among the \nlast in the UK welfare system to be reformed \nand until recently did not attract as much \npopular stigma as other benefits. This is also \nthe case in other countries, where people \nwho receive benefits because of ill health or \ndisability have been viewed and treated as \nmore \u201cdeserving\u201d than those receiving other \ntypes of benefit. The reform of incapacity \nbenefit is a move away from this and may \nsignal a potentially disturbing political \ndiscourse about how some patients who are \nunemployed because of illness or disability \nare less deserving of unconditional public \nsupport than others.\nIt is unclear how all this will play out, but it \nseems likely that the deserving\/undeserving \ndichotomy may well reinforce and magnify \nthe existing stigma attached to claims that are \nbased on mental illness and may therefore \nfurther increase health inequalities. Either \nway, it will have important implications for \nthe health professionals involved, as the \nvalidity of professional medical certification \nis being questioned by the government, and \nhealthcare workers will become increasingly \ninvolved in regulating the poor.\nClare I Bambra is a lecturer in public health policy, \nWolfson Research Institute, Stockton-on-Tees  \nclare.bambra@durham.ac.uk \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1452\nA version of this article with references is available on bmj.com\nHealthcare \nworkers \nwill become \nincreasingly \ninvolved in \nregulating  \nthe poor\nviews & Reviews\n518   BMJ | 30 august 2008 | VoluMe 337\nREVIEWS Of ThE WEEk \nhistory on a knife edge\nThe new series looking at the brutal and dangerous history of surgery is \ninstructive\u2014and often amusing, finds Harold ellis\nThe history of medicine is a fascinating subject, \nand undoubtedly it is the surgical aspects of this \ntopic that appeal most to the lay television audi-\nence. The drama of the operating theatre, steely \neyes over the white face mask, has lost none of \nits fascination in spite of countless programmes \nof both fact and fiction.\nThis latest contribution to the history of sur-\ngery, a series of five one hour programmes on \nBBC Four, is ambitious and interesting. It will \nintrigue the lay audience and, on the whole, its \nviewers in the health professions. It is presented \nthroughout by the medical journalist Michael \nMosley, who is medically qualified and who \nconfesses that, as a student, he wanted to be \na surgeon. He is cheerful and interesting and \nspares himself not at all in illustrating his mate-\nrial. He has a leech suck his blood, is hypnotised \n(he is an excellent subject), sniffs ether (nasty) \nand chloroform (pleasant), and gets drunk on \nvodka. He submits him-\nself to hypothermia in \nthe men\u2019s outdoor swim-\nming pool in Highgate \nin mid-winter, experi-\nments with hypoxia on \nHampstead Heath, has \nBotox injected into his \nface in Harley Street, \nand has his motor cor-\ntex stimulated in Uni-\nversity College Hospital. \nHe learns how to oper-\nate on a pig\u2019s heart and \nhow to perform a microvascular anastomosis, \nremaining happily informative throughout.\nThe first episode, \u201cBloody Beginning,\u201d \ndeals with the four basic needs for effective \nsurgery\u2014an accurate knowledge of anatomy, \ncontrol of bleeding, pain relief, and preven-\ntion of infection. We see Andreas Vesalius, the \nyoung professor of anatomy at Padua, whose \nbible was the dissected human body and whose \nDe Humani Corpora Fabrica (1543) was the basis \nof modern anatomical knowledge. Then on \nto Ambroise Par\u00e9 and his reintroduction of \nligation of blood vessels in 1564 to replace \nhaemostasis by cautery. Pain relief over the \ncenturies relied on opium and alcohol (or the \ntwo together\u2014laudanum) until the introduction \nof ether by William Morton in Boston in 1846 \nand of chloroform the following year by James \nYoung Simpson in Edinburgh.\nMosley then moves on to the dramatic and \nsad story of Ignaz Semmelweiss and his work \non puerperal infection in the maternity hospital \nin Vienna. He died in a mental hospital, prob-\nably of septicaemia, having failed to convince \nhis colleagues that the hands of the obstetrician \nspread the contagion. By a sad coincidence, in \nthe year of his death, 1865, Joseph Lister in \nEdinburgh treated his first compound fracture \npatient by antiseptic technique using carbolic \nacid. Antiseptic, and then aseptic, surgery ena-\nbled the rapid advances in modern, safe, techni-\ncal surgery over the next couple of decades.\nMosley moves on to cardiac surgery in \n\u201cBleeding Heart,\u201d bringing to mind a quote \nfrom 1893 of Theodor Billroth: \u201cAny surgeon \nwho would attempt an operation on the heart \nshould lose the respect of his colleagues.\u201d Four \nyears later Ludwig Rehn saved the life of a \nyoung man by suturing a stab wound of his \nright ventricle. Mosley takes us through the \nstory of the work on hyperthermia, the devel-\nopment of the heart-lung bypass, and cardiac \ntransportation and ends with a visit to a patient \nin Paris trundling his artificial heart on a trolley \nwhile he awaits a suitable heart donor.\n\u201cSpare Parts\u201d deals with transplant surgery, \nstarting with teeth in the 18th century (rejected \nafter a couple of months), then the pioneer \nwork of Alexis Carrell, who solved the technical \nproblems of organ transplantation in the early \n20th century but was defeated by the biology of \norgan rejection. The Nobel prize winner Joseph \nMurray is interviewed, who performed the first \nidentical twin transplantation, as is Roy Calne \nof Cambridge, who helped to develop the drugs \nused today to prevent organ rejection.\nLater Mosley also investigates plastic sur-\ngery\u2014especially facial reconstruction. He starts \nwith paraffin injections to produce a perfect \nnose (disastrous) and then Botox for wrinkles, \nand goes on to the more serious problems of \nreconstruction of the faces of first world war \nsoldiers by Harold Gillies and of burnt air-\nmen in the second world war by Archibald \n McIndoe. We view the first successful partial \nface graft and consider the possibility of total \nfacial replacement.\nIn \u201cInto the Brain\u201d we pass from a modern \nneurosurgical operation to remove an anoma-\nlous cerebral vessel in a girl with a severe focal \nepilepsy to the pioneer work of Harvey  Cushing \nin Boston and the bizarre story of Walter Free-\nman, who performed thousands of leucotomies \non patients with mental disorders.\nThis is a splendid series with much unique \nhistorical film footage. Of course, there are \nthings to criticise. Par\u00e9, my personal hero, was \nnot an \u201cignorant barber,\u201d even if he could not \nread Latin, but a skilled and experienced surgi-\ncal teacher. And was it really necessary to go \ninto a modern dissecting room to illustrate the \nimportance of anatomy? My new students often \nfaint at their first exposure to a corpse\u2014was \nthis done to titivate rather than educate? These \nminor points aside, this is an instructive and \noften amusing contribution to surgical history.\nharold Ellis is emeritus professor of surgery, University \nof London \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1362\nBlood and Guts\u2014A History of Surgery\nBBC Four, 9 pm, Wednesdays\nRating: ****\nMichael Mosley \nhas a leech suck \nhis blood, is \nhypnotised (he \nis an excellent \nsubject), sniffs \nether (nasty) \nand chloroform \n(pleasant), and \ngets drunk on \nvodka\nMosley: cheerful, and spares himself not at all\nviews & Reviews\nBMJ | 30 august 2008 | VoluMe 337       519\nBela Schick\u2019s way \nwith words, \np 521\nit takes courage and \nhumility to speak \nso openly about the \ndoubts, weaknesses, \nand errors in our \nwork, whatever the \nprofession\nComplex Ethics \nConsultations: Cases that \nHaunt Us\nEds P Ford, D Dudzinski \nCambridge University \nPress, \u00a329.99, pp 278\nISBN: 978-0521697156\nRating: ****\n \nFor the past week I have enjoyed my bus journey to work. \nIn the discomfort of my seat I pondered ethical dilem-\nmas, like a chess fanatic relishing a strange position on \nthe board. In the 28 chapters of Complex Ethics Consult\u00ad\nations North American hospital ethicists share their most \nhaunting cases. In \u201cThe Sound of Chains\u201d Jeffrey Spike \nrecounts the story of Angel, a comatose baby on a ven-\ntilator. The prognosis is bleak: an enduring coma or a \npermanent vegetative state. Angel was a shaken baby, \nand his mother, a suspect, asked to see him. The question \nposed to the ethicist over the phone: \u201cShould the mother \nbe allowed to visit her child?\u201d The healthcare staff were \ndivided over the issue. When the mother arrived at the \nhospital she wore an orange prison jumpsuit with heavy \nchains joining her wrists and ankles. She wants to hold \nthe baby. Should this be permitted? As she gently rocks \nthe baby in her arms, the heartbreaking options are laid \nout: withdraw the ventilator or place Angel in the next \navailable nursing home. For Spike this case represents \n\u201cthe true meaning of tragedy.\u201d\nIn another chapter Denise Dudzinski presents 50 year \nold Cindy Johnson, who injured her wrist 10 years ago \nworking on an assembly line. She had tried, with no suc-\ncess, various psychiatric and physical therapies to cure her \ncomplex regional pain syndrome, a neuropathic disorder \nthat made any contact with the exposed skin of her left \narm and wrist excruciating. Suffering from oedema, cel-\nlulitis, and joint contractures she now wants to amputate \nher arm, even if it might not relieve her pain. \u201cI\u2019m sick \nof being careful with it and telling everyone else to watch \nout. I can\u2019t play with my grandson for fear of bumping \ninto him,\u201d she said. Uncertainty over Cindy\u2019s best inter-\nests remains to this day. While ethicists try to bring clarity \nto an ethical problem, Dudzinski reminds us that \u201cstriving \nfor clarity does not mean striving for certainty.\u201d A good \nethicist should identify morally relevant uncertainties.\nThe other chapters follow in a similar vein, each \ndivided into case presentation, professional reflections, \nhaunting aspects, outcome, and questions for discussion. \nHowever enthralling they may be, the volume is not \nabout cases. It is about the hardships of doing clinical \nethics and the people who perform ethics consultations. \nEach chapter is an invitation to enter the mind of the ethi-\ncist; thus D Micah Hester, caught in a disagreement over \nthe appropriate goal of care for a severely anoxic baby, \ncandidly confesses in an excellent chapter: \u201cI am haunted \nby the thought that I did not do enough, groped around \ntoo much, did not speak up, asked the wrong questions, \nand failed to push for further and deeper clarification.\u201d\nHester notes with regret that he did not talk to the \nparents, who, contrary to the healthcare team, wanted \naggressive treatment to continue. He relied instead on the \naccounts of hospital staff. The lesson is clear: talk to the \npatients, relatives, and other stakeholders when making \nan ethical evaluation; insights may be gleaned from the \ncareful listening of different narratives. In my experience, \nclinical ethics committees, the dominant model in the \nUnited Kingdom, do not usually follow this advice.\nAnother key lesson is that ethics consultations, like all \nmedical interventions, can harm as well as benefit. Ethi-\ncists make errors, and these can have dire consequences. \nJoseph DeMarco and Paul Ford discuss the case of Mr \nCarl, a 60 year old man who had open heart surgery three \ndays before the ethics consultation. On continuous venti-\nlatory support since the operation, he is, his wife believes, \nin great pain. She wants to withdraw the ventilator, claim-\ning that her husband would not want to live in such a \nstate. The surgeon disagrees: it\u2019s only been three days; \nthe patient needs time to recover. After several hours of \nheated deliberation by Mrs Carl, the healthcare staff, and \nthe ethics team, the nurse removed the ventilator. \u201cIt was \ndifficult to sleep that night,\u201d write the authors. \u201cWe could \nhave been wrong in this case. If we were, a person would \nhave died without the chance he should have had.\u201d\nIt takes courage and humility to speak so openly about \nthe doubts, weaknesses, and errors in our work, whatever \nthe profession. This volume uncovers the moral richness \nand complexity of clinical practice, but it also raises \nimportant questions about the value, roles, methods, and \ntraining of clinical ethicists\u2014signs of a budding profession. \nFrom the 19th century, especially in Britain, emerging \nspecialties have often been faced with initial distrust or \nscepticism from more established disciplines. Clinical \nethics is no exception. This collection signals a new stage \nin the development of clinical ethics, out of childhood \nand into an adolescence that is occasionally troubled and \nconfused but also full of hope and promise.\nDaniel k Sokol is a lecturer in medical ethics and law at St George\u2019s, \nUniversity of London \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1443\nDaniel K sokol is impressed by a collection of case studies that signals a new stage in the \ndevelopment of clinical ethics\n \nClinical ethics comes of age\nviews & Reviews\n520   BMJ | 30 august 2008 | VoluMe 337\nThe sports were often boring, but we sat blurry eyed \non the couch, cheering on our athletes. We were glad \nthat there were no velodromes in Africa, we praised \nJohn Major, we embraced Scots as British, we felt a \nsense of guilty pride as the national anthem resounded \nat full volume, and we smiled at the Australians. Sport \nis like art, with a quality to enrich lives that transcends \nreligion, sex, and class\u2014this in an economic climate \nwhen half the population may be reduced to eating \nspam sandwiches. There is something deeply admi-\nrable and levelling about sportsmen and women: it is \nthe tangible nature of their achievement, the spectacle, \nthe commitment, the passion, and the marriage of the \nindividual and team.\nIt is odd then that competitive sport is so marginal-\nised in our educational system and is seen as eroding \nchildren\u2019s self esteem. So instead we suffer the tedium \nof non-competitive sports days and futile games of \nfootball where no one counts the goals. This non-\ncompetitive zeal is everywhere. The once mighty A \nlevel examination now has a 97% pass rate, and the \nmedical training application service (MTAS) debacle \nwas partly sparked by application forms that allowed \nnothing to be written on them. This is all in the name \nof that social monster \u201cfairness,\u201d which is levelling \ntraditional social structures\u2014but the rubble is just as \nuneven and unequal.\nCompetition is the invisible force that drives us all \non, and to suggest otherwise is dishonest. And con-\ntrary to the current dogma, competition is the very \nengine of self regard. Esteem ebbs and flows though \nour lives; it is not a gift or inalienable human right but \ninstead is earned through perseverance. Winning is \nimportant, but losing the more so, for it is the phoenix \nof renewal. Sport has always been a proxy for soci-\nety and used throughout history to maintain values. \nRegrettably, this team mentality has been replaced \nwith a gang mentality.\nDoctors forget that medicine is a team sport too, \nwhere the needs of the individual are secondary to the \nneeds of the group and where respect, loyalty, trust, \ncommitment, belief, and passion define us as doctors. \nThese are the historical core elements of any success-\nful progressive general practice or innovative hospital \nfirm. So Team GB\u2019s legacy must be that we do not shy \naway from competitiveness but rather recapture its \nenergy. Medicine should get off the comfortable pro-\nfessional couch and strive harder in the race of life.\nDes Spence is a general practitioner, Glasgow destwo@yahoo.co.uk \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1449\nIt was late, and we were closing \nup, when the surgery bell rang.

Those of us \nwho are fat will be \ngiven cash incentives \nto lose weight, appar-\nently. Of course, I can \nquite see the logic of \nthis: it will save the \ncountry money in \nthe end. But perhaps \nan even better idea \nwould be televised \nhumiliation sessions \nfor those who failed \nto lose weight, in \nfront of a paying, \nand possibly even \na baying, audience, \ncomplete with pun-\nishment for the worst \noffenders, as voted \nby the viewers. Not \nonly would this save \nmoney in the long \nterm, it would posi-\ntively raise money \nin the short term. The television rights \ncould be substantial.\nLike every doctor I am against obes-\nity, smoking, and animal fats and in \nfavour of lentils and exercise. But once, \nwhen investigating the way people \nactually lived, I attended a bingo hall, \nwhich I had never done before, and saw \na large number of overweight elderly \npeople having a lovely time, smoking, \ndrinking beer, and eating chips. It was \nthe very antithesis of doctors\u2019 orders, \nand it lifted my heart to see so many \npeople disobey us utterly.\nI bet they all lied to us as well, telling \nus how, despite their very best efforts, \nthe weight just wouldn\u2019t come off.\nI couldn\u2019t help thinking of Falstaff. \nThe old man\u2014that \u201cwhoreson obscene \ngreasy tallow-catch\u201d\u2014is wholly rep-\nrehensible of course, and yet one \nwouldn\u2019t have him other than as he is. \nExcellent as uprightness and good sense \nare, a world in which everyone without \nexception was upright and sensible \nwould be more or less intolerable.\nIn the bingo hall I remembered how \nFalstaff, playing Prince Hal to Prince \nHal\u2019s King Henry \nin an imaginary \nrehearsal of Prince \nHal\u2019s interview with \nhis disapproving \nfather, utters this \nencomium to him-\nself:\n\u201cThat he is old, \nthe more the pity, \nhis white hairs do \nwitness it, but that \nhe is, saving your \nreverence, a whore-\nmaster, that I utterly \ndeny. If sack and \nsugar be a fault, God \nhelp the wicked! If \nto be old and merry \nbe a sin, then many \nan old host I know \nis damned.

When he claims, preposterously, \nto have killed Harry Hotspur himself in \nthe battle at Shrewsbury, and hopes for \nan earldom or a duchy as a reward, he \nsays: \u201cIf I do grow great, I\u2019ll grow less, \nfor I\u2019ll purge, and leave sack, and live \ncleanly as a nobleman should do.\u201d\nI think he would have been a good \ncandidate for the government\u2019s bribery \ntreatment.\nTheodore Dalrymple is a writer and retired doctor \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1417\nThe wisdom of falstaff\nBETWEEN  \nThE LINES\nTheodore Dalrymple\nA world deprived of \nfoolishness, of gaiety  \nfor its own sake, of  \nnon-conformity to the \ndictates of good sense, such \nas is dreamed of by puritans \nof all stripes, whether \nreligious or medical, would \nbe dreary indeed\nMeDiCAL CLAssiCs\nAphorisms and Facetiae of Bela Schick\nBy I J Wolf First published 1965\n\u201cMeetings are for meeting people\u2014the scientific \nsessions are of secondary importance,\u201d declared \nthe professor to his retinue, commenting on an issue \nrekindled in recent years by the advent of video \nteleconferencing. On another occasion he wistfully \nreflected: \u201cAfter 20 years one is no longer quoted \nin the medical literature. Every 20 years one sees a \nrepublication of the same ideas.\u201d\nThe professor, Bela Schick, was born in Hungary, \nstudied in Austria, and from 1923 to 1942 was director \nof paediatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. At his \nretirement he suggested that every chief should have a \ndog and leave it in the department where he had served; \nfor like Ulysses returning to Ithaca after his long absence \nhe will find that only his dog will recognise him. But in \nscientific circles Dr Schick is remembered for devising the \ntest used to determine susceptibility to diphtheria. The \nSchick test (1911) consisted of injecting intradermally a \nsmall amount of toxin; redness and swelling of the skin \naround the injection site indicated a positive result.\nLike many university professors of his time he had a \ntendency to develop an oracular style and cast precious \npearls before his impressionable younger associates. \nHe had, moreover, a compulsive younger associate \nwho early in life had developed the habit of committing \nhis various chiefs\u2019 utterances to paper. At Mount Sinai \nHospital I J Wolf wrote down Dr Schick\u2019s sayings and later \npublished them in a 50 page \nbook. Many of the sayings are \nmemorable and still relevant. \nBe humble, be kind to your \npatients, and be sceptical, for \nyour patients have the right to \nmore than mere science. One \nof his favorite expressions \nwas \u201ctincture of time,\u201d for \ntime was the physician\u2019s \nbest remedy in treating or \nclarifying a difficult case. On \nward rounds, when an x ray picture was nowhere to be \nfound, he would say that \u201csomeone must have it in his \nprivate collection.\u201d Once he said that you could always \nmake a theory but must keep open a window so as to \nthrow it out if necessary. \u201cStatistics could prove anything, \neven the truth.\u201d And \u201cit takes 10 years for a good idea to \nbecome established\u201410 years for a wrong observation \nto be forgotten.\u201d\nHe did not like seeing babies placed in rows in the \nnursery \u201clike bread on a baker\u2019s shelves,\u201d for \u201cto expose \na newborn to infection is criminal.\u201d On the subject of \nretirement from medical practice he suggested that it was \nvery difficult to slow down, for the practice of medicine \nwas like the heart\u2019s contraction, all or none. Commenting \non a case where an inordinate number of tests had been \nordered, he remarked, \u201cHe did not know a case could \nhave so many possibilities of investigation.\u201d And when \na subaltern was droning on and presenting a case in a \nmonotonous and inaudible voice he turned around and \nsaid, \u201cPlease\u2014louder and funnier.\u201d\nGeorge Dunea president and chief executive officer, hektoen \nInstitute of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois gdu222@yahoo.com \nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a1358\nschick as depicted on a \nJewish-American Hall of \nFame silver medal, 1957\n"}
