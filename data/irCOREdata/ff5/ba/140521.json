Previous research indicates that a relationship\nmanagement role is very different from \u2018traditional\u2019 sales, and that it may require a\ndifferent attitude on the part of the relationship manager. This research explores\nattitudes towards various aspects of relationship management across an entire\ninternational business-to-business sales force in a service industry context. We find\nthat attitudes towards relationship management do not in fact align with job role. A\ncluster analysis reveals three attitudinal types of sales person: Self-Directed; Team\nLeaders; and Strategic Sellers. Our findings suggest that some individuals may have\nattitudes that are inappropriate to their roles, and that attitudes should be taken into\naccount when selecting relationship managers.\nKey words: Relationship marketing, sales, sales management, key account\nmanagement\n4INTRODUCTION AND CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND\nIt is almost 30 years since David Ford suggested that, in managing long-term\nbusiness-to-business relationships, there is a role for what he called a \u2018relationship\nmanager\u2019 who is the major contact for the client company and who takes\nresponsibility for the successful development of the relationship with the client. He\nargued that the relationship manager role should be fulfilled by someone of sufficient\nstatus to co-ordinate all aspects of the company\u2019s relationships with its major clients\n(Ford 1980).\nRecent research has called for a distinction between the activities of selling and\nongoing relationship management (e.g. Blythe 2005; McDonald & Woodburn 2007;\nRyals & McDonald 2008). This paper explores the role of the relationship manager,\nand the increasing requirement for sales people to transition to relationship\nmanagement. Following Weitz & Bradford (1999), we define \u2018relationship managers\u2019\nas those individuals responsible, over the long term, for the end-to-end relationship\nwith a business-to-business customer, including communication, sales, and after sales\nservice, and who act as the primary point of contact for a customer. We use the term\n\u2018relationship manager\u2019 to differentiate our research from the field of customer\nrelationship management (CRM) which is increasingly identified with business-to-\nconsumer markets and technological systems for customer management (e.g.\nBlattberg & Deighton 1996; Brassington & Pettit 2000; Ahn et al. 2003; Ryals &\nPayne 2001; Ryals et al. 2005).\n5Despite the growing tendency of sales people to become relationship managers (Biong\n& Selnes 1996; Wotruba 1996; McDonald et al. 1997; Piercy et al. 1997, 1998; Weitz\n& Bradford 1999), little research has been carried out on whether sales people have a\npredisposition to undertake these relational roles. This is an important gap because of\nthe different requirements of these two roles (e.g. Ryals & McDonald 2008).\nMoreover, previous typologies of sales people based on the type of roles sales people\nare fulfilling (McMurray 1961; Moncrief 1986; Moncrief et al. 2006; Newton 1973)\nhave not yet been extended to the service sector. This study uses an instrument,\ndeveloped from the literature and tested through intensive pilot interviews, to examine\nthe attitudes of an entire service sector sales force in an effort to address the call of\nMoncreif et al. (2006) for a greater understanding of the sales and relationship\nmanager role in the service sector.\nEmergence of the relationship management role\nThe emergence of relationship marketing in the late 1980s led to a growing interest in\ngetting and keeping customers through relationship management (e.g. Christopher et\nal. 1991; Gr\u00f6nroos 1994, 1997; Sheth & Parvatiyar 1995; Aijo 1996; Gummesson\n1997). The idea of the relationship manager was extended and developed during the\n1980s and 1990s, particularly in business-to-business markets where specialized\nforms of managing customers have gained increasing importance (Homburg et al.\n2000). Researchers have suggested that the relationship manager role has different\nvariants for managing different types of customer account: national account managers\n(Shapiro & Moriarty 1980, 1982, 1984a, 1984b; Stevenson 1980, 1981; Tutton 1987;\nWotruba 1996; Weilbacker & Weeks 1997; Dishman & Nitze 1998); major account\nmanagers (Barrett 1986; Colletti & Tubridy 1987); and, more recently, to manage the\n6most strategically important relationships of the business, Key Account Managers\n(Wilson 1993; Pardo et al. 1995; Millman & Wilson 1995, 1996, 1998; Millman\n1996; McDonald et al. 1997; McDonald & Rogers 1998; Holt 2003) or even global\naccount managers (Yip & Madsen 1996; Millman 1996; Millman & Wilson 1999;\nHolt 2003).\nTraditional sales role\nHistorically, personal selling has been viewed from a transaction orientation (Jackson\net al. 1994; Cespedes 1994), a mindset reinforced by reward systems that focus on\nrevenue generation (Wotruba 1996). The traditional role of sales has been defined as\n\u201cTo stimulate, rather than satisfy, demand for products. To persuade customers that\nthey need a supplier\u2019s product, sales people in this role focus on achieving short-term\nresults for their companies by using aggressive selling techniques to persuade\ncustomers to buy products\u201d (Weitz & Bradford 1999:243) through the use of\n\u201caggressive selling techniques\u201d (Weitz & Bradford 1999:243). This role is supported\nby five basic types of activity carried out by the sales person: contacting customers,\nselling the product or service, working with wholesalers, servicing the account, and\nmanaging information between the seller and buyer (Cespedes 1994). So,\ntraditionally, salespeople have considered their roles fulfilled when the sale is made\n(Corcoran et al. 1995).\nHowever, this tactical view of sales activities is beginning to change, driven by the\nmove from a transactional to a relational focus (Jackson et al. 1994; Wotruba 1996;\nAnderson 1996; Leigh & Marshall 2001). In practice, in business-to-business markets,\nrelationship marketing for the supplier organization is largely carried out through\n7people in boundary roles, such as salespeople, area managers, account managers and\nkey account managers. These people increasingly play a key role in the formation of\nlong-term buyer-seller relationships (Burger & Cann 1995; Biong & Selnes 1995,\n1996; Doney & Cannon 1997; Piercy 2006; Weitz & Bradford 1999).\nImpact of relationship marketing on sales\nRelationship marketing is bringing a change to the practice of personal selling and\nsales management as a result of this increased attention on long-term, buyer-seller\nrelationships (Biong & Selnes 1996; Wotruba 1996; McDonald et al. 1997; Piercy et\nal. 1997, 1998; Weitz & Bradford 1999). The salesperson\u2019s role in long-term\nrelationships is increasingly seen as crucial in creating value for customers as well as\nfor their own organization (Weitz & Bradford 1999).\nThe transition to relationship management (Marshall & Michaels 2001; Piercy 2006;\nRackham & DeVincentis 1999; Storbacka et al. 2009; Weitz & Bradford 1999) means\nthat the practice of sales increasingly involves longer-term strategic roles such as\ncustomer partner, buyer\/seller team coordinator, customer service provider, buyer\nbehavior expert, information gatherer, market analyst, planner, sales forecaster,\nmarket cost analyzer and technologist (Anderson 1996; Marshall & Michaels 2001;\nPiercy 2006; Rackham & DeVincentis 1999; Storbacka et al. 2009; Weitz & Bradford\n1999; Wilson 1993). Consequently, it has been argued that not only the role but also\nthe necessary attitudes, competences and skills required of modern sales people and\nrelationship managers differ from those needed by traditional salespeople (Shapiro &\nMoriarty 1984a; McDonald et al. 1997; Millman & Wilson 1998; Weitz & Bradford\n81999). If so, a re-evaluation of sales typologies that pre-date these developments and\nwere originally developed around more traditional selling is needed.\nSales Typologies\nUntil Moncreif et al. (2006) revisited their earlier work (Moncreif 1986), the\ntraditional typologies for sales people (McMurray 1961; Newton 1973) had been\ndeveloped around the traditional sales role. However, a number of authors have\nattempted to identify the attitudes, skills and behaviors required by salespeople in\nrelational situations in business-to-business markets as opposed to transactional\nsituations (Lagace et al. 1991; Biong & Selnes 1995; Corcoran et al. 1995; Boles &\nJohnston 1999; Wotruba 1996; Leuthesser 1997; Rackham & De Vincentis 1998;\nWeitz & Bradford 1999) and in services markets (Crosby et al. 1990) which Moncreif\net al. (2006) utilize to provide a contemporary taxonomy of sales roles. Moncreif et\nal. (2006) suggested the typological roles of Consultative Seller (a nurturing role with\nexisting customer providing product support as well as promotional activities making\nup 34.2% of the work force) and Key Account Seller (a customer partner role\ninvolving high levels of support services, contact time, product delivery management,\nmaking up 8.3% of the sales force). These types were identified through a cluster\nanalysis of the activities of sales people, which identifies what sales people do but not\ntheir attitudes to the relational roles they are increasingly being asked to fulfill.\nAttitudes of sales people towards relationship management\nConceptually, the notion that sales people have different attitudinal predispositions\nforms the basis for sales models such as Blake & Mouton (1964; see also Sternberg &\nSoriano 1984). In practice, many relationship managers manage more than one\n9customer (Ryals et al. 2005) and the preferred relationship management strategy for\neach may differ based on the type of customer and the supplier\u2019s strategy in relation to\nthat customer (Johnson & Selnes 2004; Gopalan 2007). Therefore, the attitudes of\nsales people and of relationship managers could be an important issue for\norganizations wanting to introduce relationship management practices, in order to\n\u2018match\u2019 them to customers where their particular attitudes and approach chimed with\nthe organization\u2019s strategic stance towards that customer. It has even been suggested\nthat sales people who are good at traditional selling may be ill-suited to relationship\nmanager roles (Ryals and McDonald 2008).\nTransitioning services sales people into relationship manager roles\nManagerially, whether good sales people make good relationship managers is an\nincreasingly important question. As the demand for relationship managers grows\n(McDonald et al. 1997; Piercy 2006), it is the successful sales person who is most\nlikely to be appointed into a relationship manager role managing strategically\nimportant customers. However, the requirements of the relationship manager role are\nvery different from those of the traditional sales role (Ryals & McDonald 2008).\nFurthermore, Moncreif et al. (2006) argue that there is a need to investigate the roles\nof sales people outside the manufacturing sector (where earlier typologies have\nmainly been developed) and examine the service sector, which previous research has\nindicated might have distinct sales and relationship management roles (Crosby et al.\n1990; George & Kelly 1983).\n10\nThe research aim is to investigate whether the modern sales force is attitudinally\nadjusted to relationship selling roles. It extends previous research on sales typologies\ninto the service context, comparing attitudes and job roles across a large international\nbusiness-to-business sales force in a service organization that had recently committed\nitself to relationship management.\nMETHODOLOGY\nResearch Objective and Approach\nThe research objective was to investigate the attitudes towards relationship\nmanagement amongst a group of service sales people in a context where the supplier\nhad a differential relationship management strategy towards its different business-to-\nbusiness customers.\nThe case study approach is the most appropriate for looking at a complex\nphenomenon that is underdeveloped in the literature (Yin 2003, Scholz & Tietje 2002,\nStrauss & Corbin 1998, Baker 2001) such as the roles and attitudes of sales and\nrelationship managers in service sector organisations. To gain a deep insight into the\nrange of sales and relationship management functions and typologies within an\norganization we utilised a two-step methodology as suggested by Moncrief et al.\n(2006): firstly a qualitative study to identify the roles of a relationship manager within\nservice sector organisations and secondly a quantitative empirical investigation of the\nattitudes of sales people from different functional roles across an entire global sales\norganisation towards relationship management roles, providing attitudinal typologies\nof sales people within the service sector.\n11\nResearch instrument development\nTo explore our research objective we developed an instrument that was capable of\nexploring the full scope of a service sector sales force across the differing roles of\nsales and relationship management. We created a structured questionnaire designed to\nexplore attitudes and approaches to sales and relationship management. The\ninstrument was developed using both in-depth practitioner interviews and cross-\ncomparison to the extant literature regarding the roles a service sector relationship\nmanager had to fulfill and how these differed from the traditional sales role.\nFour global business-to-business service organisations were selected for the\ndevelopment of the instrument. The selection criteria included having a range of\ndifferent size customer accounts, with existing relationship management practices\nwhich had been in place for between one and five years, having a large sales force,\nand having a range of distinct sales and relationship management functions. The four\ncompanies were: Courier Co. a global logistics and courier business; Computer Co. a\nnetworking and software service company; Component Co. a distributer of\nmanufacturing components; and Equipment Co. an office fitter and supplier and\ndistributer of office equipment. Key informants were selected for interview to develop\nour understanding of the roles fulfilled and the attitudes required by relationship\nmanagers.\nFollowing Yin (1994), the sources were organised into four key groups that could\nprovide information on various aspects of relationship management. Data were\ncollected from the relationship managers about their activities and roles. To ensure an\nexhaustive list of relationship manager activities we also interviewed their customers,\n12\nsenior or line managers, and colleagues or team members. A full review of the\nmethodology used in this first research stage is available in Holt & McDonald (2000;\n2001).\nThirty-eight interviews were carried out across four organisations, with a further 5\nrelationship manager interviews used for cross-checking purposes, giving 43\ninterviews in total (Table 1). The results of this first phase of study are summarized in\ntable 2, which was the starting point in developing scales to explore the differences\nbetween relationship management and sales roles. The totality of the research\nuncovered in these interviews is reported elsewhere (Holt 2003; Davies et al. 2008).\n[Table 1 about here]\nTo ensure external validity, the results of the qualitative phase were compared and\nqualified against the extant literature on sales and relationship management. Table 2\ncross-validates the constructs developed in the qualitative interviews with the\nliterature and compares the role of a traditional sales person with that of a relationship\nmanager. Those activities with an asterisk identify where the roles of the relationship\nmanager in the service sector match the manufacturing sector components in Moncreif\net al. (2006). Table 2 formed the basis for the quantitative phase of the study\n(following Moncrief et al. 2006).\n[Table 2 about here]\n13\nUsing qualitative data from four very different industries enhanced external validity\nand generalizability, enabling the development of a quantitative survey instrument\nwith wide service sector applicability. The survey comprised a series of 42 questions,\n23 of which are reported here, answered by means of a 7 point Likert scale (see\nAppendix 1 for the scales). As with other questionnaire designs, several of the\nstatements were worded negatively and were then reversed during data analysis\n(Hague 1993, Brace 2004).\nQuantitative survey participating company\nFor the quantitative stage, we sought a service business meeting the same criteria as\npreviously. We focused on a single company to get census-style data from across their\nsales force, thereby ensuring that we covered all potential groups within the sales\nforce (high internal validity) and could standardize the descriptions of the types of\ncustomers they were managing. The company selected is a global airline company and\nwas selected because the company and the industry are \u2018unremarkable\u2019 or typical\n(Miles & Huberman 1994). Although the industry has experienced recent\ndisintermediation in business-to-consumer markets, the organization is still required\nto maintain high levels of sales operations in the business-to-business sector which\nwas the focus of this study. The business-to-business sales and customer management\nteams deal predominantly with freight, tour operators and commercial partners and\nwith bulk seat sales to travel agents (including to major and key accounts).\nDifferentiation in the market is largely based on existing relationships and differential\nservice bundles which the sales force actively create and sell a partially customized\nmanner. At the time of the study, the case company was seeking to redevelop its sales\n14\nstrategy through relationship management. In particular, it was looking to identify\npeople who might become future key account managers for a number of key accounts.\nData collection\nThe sample frame at the airline was just over 400 individuals, accounting for all seven\nof the sales and customer management functions within the organization. Computer\nterminals were set up at the global sales conference and 30 minutes set aside per\ndelegate in their conference schedule to partake in the research. Two researchers were\non hand at all times to provide assistance when required and, although the company\nlanguage was English, translation support was provided in three other languages. This\nresulted in a very high response rate of 85% of the global sales force and customer\nmanagement teams.\n[Table 3 about here]\nClassification data were collected relating to job title, number of accounts managed,\nrelative value of accounts (generally this is inversely proportional to the degree of\nrelationship management required), and number of years in sales (as an indication of\nsales experience \u2013 Table 3). Gender and nationality data were not collected, at the\nrequest of the case organization. Respondents identified themselves by entering their\nunique employee number. This item was used by senior managers within the company\nto identify the type of account(s) they worked with, and the sales roles they fulfilled.\nThis reduced the risk of self-reporting bias regarding account importance identified as\na problem in pilot studies.\n15\nData analysis\nAttitudinal data do not necessarily follow the conventions of normality as assumed in\nmany analysis techniques (e.g. ANOVA and Structural Equation Modelling). Under\nKolmogorow-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests all 23 measures were\nsignificant at the <0.05 level indicating high incidents of non-normality. Although\ntransformation of the non-normal data is a viable option, it would violate the purpose\nof the study. Thus, we primarily employ non-parametric tests in reporting our results.\nSimilarly, Levene tests in all but nine of the dimensions give significant results\nindicating that equality of variance is not present. With this in mind we have used the\nKruskal-Wallis test to look for differences between roles\/account types (two-tailed\ntest), we have also used Games-Howell post hoc ANOVAs to confirm the findings of\nthis test.\nWe have used a cluster analysis to explore the distribution of relationship\nmanagement attitudes across the workforce, conducted according to the K-Means\nmethod using Euclidean distance (MacQueen 1967). K-means is the most popular\nmethod of clustering in marketing and is especially useful when dealing with large\ndata sets (Dillon 1994; Wendel & Kamakura 2000).\nIn contrast to hierarchical cluster analysis, K-means requires predetermination of the\nnumber of clusters. However, the number and characteristics of the groups were not\nknown prior to the analysis. In tests of thirty methods for identifying the number of\nclusters in a population, Milligan & Cooper (1985) identified three methods that\nproved significantly more robust than the others, especially when used in\n16\ncombination: Pseudo f, Pseudo t and the Cubic Clustering Criterion (CCC). As\nPseudo t calculations cannot be calculated with K-Means clustering, we ran\nsimulations from K-Means clusters between two and 20, calculating both Pseudo f\nand CCC (using SAS). CCC can be used for basic hypothesis testing and estimating\nthe number of population clusters; it has also proved very effective in large samples\n(Sarle 1983). Although the Pseudo f for our data set does not demonstrate a single\nclear \u2018local peak\u2019 relative to the cluster numbers either side, a large increase in the\nCCC at the three cluster level, combined with one of the local peaks in the Pseudo-f at\nthis same point, suggests the suitability of a three cluster solution. This solution also\nmeets a secondary criterion that there are sufficient numbers of cases in each cluster\nto allow statistical analysis (Cluster 1 = 73 people, Cluster 2 = 87 people, Cluster 3 =\n140 people).\nRESULTS\nAttitudes towards Relationship Management\nLooking at the organization as a whole, we find a great divergence in the level to\nwhich individuals rate their approaches as related to relationship management. Figure\n1 provides a 95% confidence interval of the probable population mean of attitudes\nacross the organization. High numbers imply a tendency towards Relationship\nManagement and low numbers indicate a tendency towards a \u2018traditional\u2019 non-\nrelational sales perspective.\n[Insert Figure 1 Here]\n17\nThe results indicate the extent to which the airline\u2019s sales people had relationship\nmanagement attitudes towards their roles, focusing on researching and understanding\ncustomers and their problems, and interacting regularly with them. We see a strong\ntendency to prefer deep data collection, expanding contacts within customer from\nsingle point of contact to multiple points of contact, being adaptable to match\ncustomer cultural norms, and a greater propensity to delegate and work in teams.\nHowever, Figure 1 also shows that the move towards relationship management is not\nuniversal across all role attributes. The respondents\u2019 predisposition to take decisions\nwithout involving others, take risks when uncertain, prefer customers who are\npredominantly interested in price, and laxity in implementing plans, are somewhat at\nodds with the notion of relationship management and, in fact, more reminiscent of\ntraditional sales people.\nAlthough these findings are suggestive of some relational selling attributes (e.g.\nplanning, data collection and analysis), they are also indicative of more traditional\nattitudes (using intuition, ignoring implementation plans, bidding for all business\nregardless of capability to supply or profitability). This could be problematic for the\ncompany if expensive strategic activity, such as time spent on data collection,\nplanning and building networks, is ineffectively used by their sales force when it\ncomes to prioritization of activities, customer demands and opportunities during the\ncustomer interaction.\nHomogeneity of attitude across sales roles\nOf great interest to the case company was the extent to which individual\u2019s attitudes\nmapped to the increasing requirements for relationship management in their existing\n18\nroles. Discussions with the senior managers revealed that accounts were aligned with\ndifferent groups within the sales force based on the extent to which certain customer\ngroups required customized, or higher service levels. In other words, the company\ngave its commodity accounts to Call Centers and Sales and Senior Sales Executives,\naccounts requiring small amounts of customization and relationship management to\nSales and Senior Sales Executives and Area\/Regional Managers, medium to high\npriority relationship management accounts to Sales Managers, and large, highly\ncustomized accounts to Key Account Managers.\nThis process of account allocation should mean that Sales Managers and Key Account\nManagers are more attuned to relationship management than the rest of the sales\nforce. Certainly, they actively manage fewer accounts than their compatriots (Table 3)\nbut, when it comes to their attitude towards relationship management, we find no\ndifference between any of the five job roles using the Kruskal-Wallis test (because of\nthe small sample sizes in Communications Executives, Call Centre Managers and\nSales Support, these responses were condensed into one group designated \u2018Other\u2019).\nThe only exception to this, and an extremely surprising one, is that the company\u2019s\nKey Account Managers have a lower strategic orientation and a stronger preference\nfor seeking revenue over a strategic relationship than any other group. Although care\nmust be taken when interpreting results from such a small group (seven individuals),\nthis finding is suggestive of a problem in the selection of key account managers.\nAnecdotal evidence suggested that the company tended to promote its top-performing\nsales people into key account manager roles, and that these individuals were more\nmotivated by revenue-seeking than by relationship-building.\n19\nTo confirm that the lack of differentiation between the groups was not due to the\nlower level of accuracy of non-parametric test we conducted a Games-Howell post\nhoc ANOVA. Although there are 230 possible points of variance between the five\ngroups over the 23 measures, only 12 points of difference are significant between the\ngroups (selected results are reported in Table 4), four of which relate to the Key\nAccount Managers\u2019 lack of strategic orientation discussed above.\n[Table 4 about here]\nThe other points of difference are the reluctance of the Sales and Senior Sales\nExecutives to delegate to team members; lack of influence over technical or\noperational departments; and preference for working alone as opposed to managing\nother people. These contrast with the results for the Sales Managers and Area\nManagers. This result is as expected: Sales and Area Managers would be expected to\nshow a greater orientation towards delegating and influencing and managing others.\nThe sample sizes for both Key Account Managers and the Other group (which\nincludes Call Centre Managers) are small, which would lead to lower significance.\nHowever, a visual inspection of the results using a radar diagram (Figure 2) suggests\nthat the five groups mirrored each other closely in terms of their attitude to\nrelationship management. In fact, a visual inspection suggests that, if anything, the\nKey Account Managers score lower in terms of relationship management because of a\nlack of organization and formalized working, as well as having a lower propensity to\nextend their depth of contact within a customer, relying on their principal contact\nmore than the other groups.\n20\n[Figure 2 near here]\nIn summary, the Sales Managers and Key Account Managers in the case company do\nnot differ from the rest of the sales force in terms of their attitude to relationship\nmanagement. If further research confirmed this finding in other organizations, it might\nexplain Wilson\u2019s (1993) contention that relationship management has often led to\nlower profit margins as companies adopt the processes (planning and analysis etc.) of\nrelationship management, but not the attitudes and understanding of how this changes\nthe role of the salesperson.\nThree Attitudinal Clusters\nSo far, our analysis has failed to find a link between the job role and the attitude\ntowards relationship management. This raises a real question as to whether the\nattitudes within the different sales roles are divergent. To answer this question we\nconducted an exploratory cluster analysis which revealed three clusters of differential\nattitudes to relationship management which we characterize as Self-directed, Team\nLeader and Strategic Sales (Figure 3).\n[Insert Figure 3 Here]\nUsing Games-Howell post hoc ANOVAs we found that these three groups diverge\nsignificantly on a number of attitudinal measures. Kruskal-Wallis tests were\nconducted first to check for consistency but provide a lower level of clarity so, to\ndemonstrate the differences between groups, Games-Howell are reported (Table 5).\n21\n[Table 5 about here]\nSelf-Directed \u2013 Self-directed individuals have preferences that are suggestive of quite\na strong traditional sales slant. They prefer lower levels of contact with customers\nthan other clusters and are less inclined to collect customer information. They are the\nleast likely to plan, develop shared strategy or implement strategies. They are defined\nas self-directed because of their lack of interest in working with or delegating to an\naccount team, organising others, formalising systems (such as lines of\ncommunication), and because they have the least amount of contact or influence over\nthe people delivering the promises the sales person makes. They prefer informal\ncommunication channels, flexibility in their role, and have a dislike of spending time\ncolleting reams of customer information and planning their accounts. In essence, they\nprefer to be left to their own devices and avoid structured work patterns and\nresponsibility. The profile suggests that self-directed individuals would be unsuited to\na high-level relationship management role but might be the best group for dealing\nwith the more transactional and price-orientated customers. Sales and Senior Sales\nExecutives account for most of the self-directed cluster in the case company (Figure\n4); probably, these are the people most likely to prefer to work alone.\nTeam Leaders \u2013 The use of the term Team Leader does not infer seniority but, rather,\na preference for taking on responsibility as part of a team. Team leaders are more\nresponsive to making the strategic decisions than the self directed group. They enjoy\nteam work, are well-connected within their own delivery organisation and take\nresponsibility for the whole sales process both before and after the point of sale. They\nare also interested in the analysis, planning and execution of strategies. They are,\nhowever, the worst-connected group; they tend to be reliant on fewer individuals\n22\nwithin the customer for their knowledge of the customer\u2019s culture or strategy. They\nare also the most likely group to be influenced by revenue rather than by the strategic\nvalue of customers. So, although generally more inclined to relationship management,\nthey seem to lack some of the core attitudes that might drive them to create long-term\ncustomer partnerships. These individuals feel at their best when there is a structure in\nplace to drive their work. They enjoy gaining an understanding of the customer and\nusing this information to plan out the customer strategy. They understand the need to\nalign other areas of the business behind what they do and prefer formalized methods\nof interacting and placing demands on others. Team Leaders might suit major account\nmanagement roles (rather than key account manager roles), working with profitable\nbut non-strategic customers and chasing one-off pieces of work. Although no single\njob role within the organization dominated this group we find a higher proportion of\ncommunications executives and area managers here, which may fit with some of the\nsales support roles in which these individuals are involved.\nStrategic Sales \u2013 Strategic Sales people are in some ways similar to Team Leaders\nbut are markedly more motivated on four strategic aspects. The first and second of\nthese are their depth of contact and depth of knowledge within their customers; they\nbuild much deeper networks and prefer to rely on multiple points of reference for their\ndecision making, providing a more powerful data source for making plans. The third\nand fourth areas are related to the longer time horizons they prefer to work to and the\nextent to which they search for strategic value in customers (as opposed to revenue).\nThese four areas are likely to make them more adept at taking relationships to a more\nstrategic level. It is interesting to note that this group is the largest within the sample,\nindicating that the majority of the sales force is at least moderately attitudinally\n23\nadjusted to the relationship management role. We do find, however, that membership\nof this group is fairly evenly spread across existing roles. Rather surprisingly, there is\nno particular tendency for people with relationship management preferences to be\nfound in relationship manager roles. Sales Managers and Key Account Managers are\nno more attitudinally aligned to relationship manager roles than their Sales Executive\ncolleagues.\n[Insert Figure 4 Here]\nFigure 4 illustrates the intriguing finding that the more relationship-oriented\nindividuals were not found exclusively or even predominantly within the account\nmanager roles. Instead, they were distributed across the entire sample. For example,\neven though many of the Sales and Senior Sales Executives are self-directed types,\nothers seemed to have attitudes better-suited to a relationship management role.\nFigure 4 suggests that the company has a number of potential relationship managers\nbut not necessarily in relationship manager job roles.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results indicate that there are indeed different attitudes to relationship\nmanagement, but that these different attitudes do not necessarily map to job roles. We\nfind three distinct groupings of attitudes, differentiated by their attitudes towards team\nworking, market sensitivity, planning, and strategic orientation. These findings are\nimportant for both theory and practice.\nImplications for Theory\n24\nThe research contributes to theory as it offers a way to test the contention made by\nprevious researchers of the development of sales as a strategic activity, focusing on\nrelationship management and having longer time horizons (Leigh & Marshall 2001;\nPiercy 2006). Our research uncovers 23 attitudes and approaches which show a\nstronger tendency towards relationship management than sales (Table 2 and Figure 1).\nIn particular, we found approaches to understanding the customer\u2019s culture, market\nenvironment (collecting information) and commercial outlook driving formalized\nstrategic development, account planning and selection of priority accounts. These\nfindings support the growing literature on the changing role of sales (Biong & Selnes\n1996; Wotruba 1996; McDonald et al. 1997; Piercy et al, 1997, 1998; Weitz &\nBradford 1999). We also find that attitudes related to forging relationships with\noperations and viewing their role as coordinating others into cohesive teams are\nstrong within our sample. These attitudes are indicative of a shift towards relationship\nmanagement and provide a needed empirical contribution in this area (McDonald et\nal. 1997; Piercy 2006). However our study failed to suggest that this move was\nuniversal across all relationship management attitudes, with a number of the\nimplementation of sales strategy attitudes (selective bidding, managing risk and\nimplementing plans) lacking within the sales force, suggesting that much of the\nformalized parts of relationship management are being enacted, but the impact of this\non how the customer in actively managed may be limited.\nOur second theoretical contribution comes through our proposal of a three-cluster\ntypology based on attitudes towards relationship management in service sector\norganizations, addressing a recent call to consider sales typologies in the service\ncontext (Moncrief et al. 2006). We labeled these \u2018Self-Directed, Team Leader, and\n25\nStrategic Sales\u2019. Self-directed people have a propensity to view themselves and their\nrole from an individualist perspective. They are unlikely to have an interest in\nmanaging others or taking on responsibility, although they see the need for having to\nget others to do a certain amount of work for them. Team Leaders are differentiated\nfrom Self-directed people based on their information management and management of\nothers, as they are more likely to prefer working in a team, building a greater\nunderstanding of the client and using this to plan out customer bids. However they are\ndistinguished from Strategic Salespeople by their predisposition towards short-\ntermism, not seeking out cultural knowledge of the customer perspectives and staying\nclear of long term joint strategic planning. Strategic Salespeople are most clearly\ndifferentiated based on their long-term outlook and predilection for complex pieces of\nwork needing volumes of data, especially cultural and organizational dynamic data\nfrom within the customer.\nIn principle, the cluster analysis might help to indicate which people have a\nrelationship management perspective, regardless of current job role. As the foregoing\ndiscussion indicates, Strategic Salespeople are the closest fit to the requirements of a\nrelationship management role as set out in the literature (e.g. McDonald & Rogers\n1998; Ryals & McDonald 2008). We note, though, that they do not score highly on all\nthe dimensions and their propensity for risk taking might need monitoring in some\nstrategic relationship situations.\nImplications for Practice\nOur research also has implications for practitioners, since we find that the\nparticipant\u2019s attitudes are sometimes at odds with relationship management. The\n26\nextended role of the relationship manager identified in the literature, and listed in\nTable 2, does provide a means of identifying relationship management attitudes in\nsales. As an empirical contribution we find that many of these attitudes are highly\nprevalent across the sales force, supporting previous research that has argued that\nsales is shifting towards relationship management (e.g. Jackson et al. 1994; Wotruba\n1996; Anderson 1996; Leigh & Marshall 2001).\nHowever, we also find that, even in an organization with a declared commitment to\nrelationship management, some of the attitudes of the sales people are perhaps closer\nto those we would expect to see in traditional transactional selling. Thus, for example,\ndespite taking time to build understanding of the client and to plan, they give a low\npriority to analyzing their data to get the most out of it. Beyond this, they often prefer\ncustomers who have price as their principle rationale for decision-making, and they\ntend to avoid prescriptive implementation plans for customer strategy.\nThis finding raises questions about the training these sales people had been given and\nalso about the organizational performance measurement and reward systems. It could\nbe that the sales people we surveyed were being asked to undertake strategic roles in\nthe organization for internal selling but were measured by and rewarded for chasing\nnon-strategic clients (although all sales people were compensated through fixed salary\nrather than commission-based rewards).\nA second contribution of our work that is important for sales directors is that we find\nlittle differentiation based on attitude towards relationship management in the more\nsenior sales people tasked with these roles. This could have a substantial bearing on\n27\nhow we think about relationship management. If in fact a different set of skills is\nrequired, which both the literature and the qualitative study suggested, then we have\nto ask whether the best sales people are the most appropriate people for these\npositions? In other words, when companies appoint people into relationship\nmanagement roles, it might be advisable for them to consider applicants from a wider\nrange of backgrounds and, perhaps, to focus on their attitudes to relationship\nmanagement rather than on their selling capabilities.\nOverall, we find no correlation between the job role (and its degree of expected\nrelationship management) and attitudes towards relationship management. This\nindicates that people in the higher-order relationship management roles in this\norganization did not get there owing to their higher propensity to work in a\nrelationship management style, which could have a significant bearing on the\nlikelihood of success for themselves and for their business. The implication for\npractitioners is that sales managers should pay more attention to attitudes before\nappointing sales people to relationship management positions to avoid misallocation\nof resources. It may even suggest that sales people are, in many respects,\ninappropriate for relationship management roles. Overall, our study demonstrates that\npeople called relationship managers don\u2019t necessarily profile like relationship\nmanagers, which certainly indicates that there is some issue with the recruitment,\ntraining, or reward of these people.\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the attitudes of a sales force towards\nrelationship management and to see whether these attitudes match their job roles. The\n28\nresults of the study provide some interesting observations that may guide future\nresearch and also influence the practice of sales.\nThe research has contributed a new theoretical notion, which is that there may be\nthree types of sales person based on their attitudes towards relationship management:\nSelf-Directed; Team Leader; and Strategic Sales. More research would be needed to\nconfirm these profiles. The single-company setting means that we are limited in the\nextent to which we can generalize the findings beyond the scope of study, although\nthe survey instrument used was developed from a number of cross-industry interviews\n(Table 1). Applying the tool to a single company did enable us to control for a number\nof extraneous variables such as consistency of role description, reward structures and\nof customers served, and reduced the impact of industry differences, making the\nsingle-company test a justifiable sacrifice. Using a single company also enabled a\nvery high response rate (85% coverage), producing an unusual data set comprising a\ncross-section of an entire sales force. Wider testing in different contexts, perhaps\nincluding customer perspectives, would be needed to establish whether the three\nclusters provide a definitive description of attitudes. Given that even the Strategic\nSales people did not fully match the theoretical description of a relationship manager,\nfuture research could explore whether there are other groupings that our research did\nnot reveal, or whether in fact the theoretical description of the perfect relationship\nmanager is unattainable in practice. Further research and testing of the instrument\nwould be needed to confirm whether it can help organizations to identify potential\naccount managers and key account managers.\n29\nIn addition to the limitation of the single-company context, there may have been some\nsocial desirability bias influencing the respondents\u2019 answers. Given that the airline\u2019s\nculture was noticeably oriented towards customers and relationships, perceived\npressure to conform to this norm might have influenced the results. However, the\nanonymity of the data-gathering process would help to reduce the social desirability\nbias.\nFrom a practical perspective, the airline used the data to inform the reshaping of its\nsales team and, in particular, to help them identify the long-term strategic thinkers\nwho could manage their key accounts. This process has enabled the airline to\nstreamline the sales force around a tiered customer management approach. The\nfinding that their Key Account Managers did not profile as expected has initiated\nsubstantial re-orientation training. The degree to which top-performing sales people\nsuccessfully transition into relationship management roles would be an interesting\ntopic for future study.\n30\nReferences\nAhn, J.Y., Kim, S.K, & Han, K.S.
