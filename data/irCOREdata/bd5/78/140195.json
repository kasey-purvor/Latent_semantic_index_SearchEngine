This \nfinding highlights the need to consider shrinkage as a systemic issue that extends across a \nbusiness from design, through planning to operational execution.  It also identifies the \nimpact of shrinkage on increasing cost and depressing sales and considers the \nresponsibility of management teams in addressing these matters. \n \nOriginality \/ value of paper \nThis paper is theoretically original and thus of value to the academic community.  It is \nalso of value to the practitioner community in grocery retailing where shrinkage and its \nmeasurement is of worldwide strategic importance.   \n \nPaper Category: Conceptual Paper \n \nKeywords:  Shrinkage  Measurement \n Page 2 \nIntroduction \nGrocery retailing is a significant industrial activity, for example in Europe the turnover of \nthe sector exceeded \u20ac1000 billion in 2003 (Beck, 2004).  This business sector can be \ncharacterised as a complex, highly competitive market made up of a diverse population of \norganisations.  Across this varied business landscape cuts the common issue of shrinkage.  \nRecent research into shrinkage has shown it to be an important issue for organisations to \nconsider, not least because shrinkage is a significant cost to the FMCG grocery industry.  \nTaking Europe as an example, shrinkage cost the sector \u20ac24 billion in 2003 (Beck, 2004). \n \nPerformance measurement has an important role to play in the efficient and effective \nmanagement of organisations (Neely, 1999) and this is certainly the case when it comes to \nthe management of shrinkage.  Given that measures and measurement systems must \nreflect the context to which they are applied (Neely, 1999), the objective of this paper is to \nscope out and summarise the contextual issues surrounding retail shrinkage in Europe\u2019s \ngrocery sector and to offer a view on the implications of these issues to shrinkage \nmeasurement.  \n \nShrinkage \nShrinkage is a significant issue to retailers as it has a major impact upon profitability in \nthis relatively low margin sector (Beck, 2004; Bernstein, 1963).  Shrinkage is also a \nresilient problem despite concerted efforts to address it spanning more then forty years \n(see for example Bernstein, 1963; Donnell, 1975).  Efforts to address shrinkage are \nhampered by the ease with which it can be viewed incorrectly.  Indeed, the degree to \nwhich shrinkage is misunderstood has led current understanding of shrinkage to be \ndescribed as, \u201cmyopic\u201d (Beck, Chapman and Peacock, 2003).  It has been long known that \nshrinkage is frequently attributed to the wrong cause (Bernstein, 1963).  For example, \nretailers often emphasise external theft as a cause of shrinkage as they are in denial of the \nlevel of theft by their own employees and therefore retailers underreport internal theft \n(Oliphant and Oliphant, 2001).   \n \nA key culprit in the misunderstanding of shrinkage is the widespread misreporting of \nfindings from industry surveys.  Surveys are a valuable research instrument however they \nhave their limitations and caution needs to be applied when conducting surveys and when \nreporting their findings.  When conducting surveys, accurate data can only be achieved if \nthere are accurate processes generating the data (Biemer and Lyberg, 2003).  Beck (2004) \nreports that most shrinkage (51%) is unknown.  Therefore the values attributed by survey \nrespondents to various causal categories for total (known and unknown) shrinkage lack \nrigor.  The findings reported from such surveys need to be considered against the question \nraised by Easterby-Smith, Thorpe and Lowe (1991) when considering research design, \u201cIs \nit the things themselves, or the people\u2019s views about them, that are important?\u201d  With \nmost shrinkage being unknown, research into this topic lacks a foundation of measured, \nquantified material which means that surveys have little value as a means of describing \nthe nature of shrinkage, the \u2018thing\u2019 in this instance.  Instead the value of industry surveys \nlies in measuring the respondent\u2019s views on the causes of shrinkage.  Taken from this \nperspective, these surveys are a valuable source of data to study the attribution process as \na topic in itself and explore shortcomings such as self-motivational biases, where failures \nare attributed to external factors in order to maintain self-esteem (Ross and Anderson, \n1982) which may help explain why external theft is often emphasised, as described above.  \n Page 3 \nHowever this is not the perspective generally taken when analysing and reporting the \nfindings from such work.  Instead, the lack of understanding of the extent and causes of \nshrinkage amongst practitioners and researchers is overlooked and various surveys are \nundertaken (for example Bamfield, 2004; Beck, 2004; Grasso, 2003; Hollinger and \nLangton, 2004) which use respondents\u2019 estimates to apportion shrinkage into causal \ncategories.  These findings are then widely reported with little attention given to their \nweaknesses.   \n \nOne consequence of this situation is that policy makers in retail organisations use these \nfindings to direct their shrinkage reduction strategies and budgets without realising their \ninvestment is based on received wisdom at best and collective falsehood at worst.  The \npoor quality of the evidence underpinning decision making and action in the area of \nshrinkage serves only to highlight this area as a microcosm of poor practice in \nmanagement research.   \n \nIn light of this situation, this paper seeks to provide an informed base from which the \nissues relating to shrinkage can be better discussed.  In particular the aim is to scope the \nsubject area and identify the contextual issues that influence shrinkage measurement. \nMethodology \nThe method to scope the contextual issues that influence shrinkage measurement draws on \nthe work of Tranfield, Denyer and Smart (2003) on the development of evidence-\ninformed management knowledge.  These researchers note that,  \n \n\u201cWithin management it will be necessary to conduct scoping studies to assess the \nrelevance and size of the literature and to delimit the subject area or topic.  Such studies \nneed to consider cross-disciplinary perspectives and alternative ways in which a research \ntopic has previously been tackled.\u201d - Tranfield et al (2003) \n \nThe methodological steps identified by Tranfield et al (2003) for conducting a scoping \nstudy capable of meeting the aim of this work are: \n \n\u2022 Form a review panel to direct the process of investigation \n\u2022 Iterate through a process of definition, clarification and refinement. \n \nAligning with the method proposed by Tranfield et al, a review panel was formed to direct \nthe process of investigation.  The academics on this panel had backgrounds in supply \nchain management, operations management, accountancy and criminology and so \ncontained cross disciplinary perspectives on method and theory.  The review panel also \nincluded practitioners working in the field, a characteristic recommended by Tranfield et \nal (2003).  The fifteen practitioners on the panel came from a range of separate retail and \nmanufacturing companies from across Europe.  This panel meet on a bi-monthly basis and \nhad done so for four years prior to this particular research being conducted.   \n \nThe review of the literature base was a desk research exercise.  This review was \nundertaken in three iterations of a procedure consisting of exploration of the theoretical \nbase in the literature followed by a critique of this material by the review panel.  This \nmethod approximates to deductive-inductive data analysis, i.e. the constant reflection of \nempirical against theoretical studies.   \n \n Page 4 \nGaps in understanding highlighted by the review panel were addressed by the subsequent \niteration of literature review.  The output of this exercise was a consensus description of \nthe contextual issues that influence shrinkage measurement.   \n \nThese findings were presented at a seminar held as part of the 2004 ECR Europe \nCongress, which was attended by 210 people.  The verbal and written feedback from this \nevent was used as a gauge of the practical implications of the research.  \n \nDelimiting Shrinkage \nClarity and consistency are required when measuring in order to ensure that like is \nmeasured with like and that each measurement is compatible.  Hence there is a need to \ndelimit the term \u2018shrinkage\u2019 and to do so in a simple and clear manner. \n \nIn a simplistic view, the value of a product is a function of several factors including its \nbeing in the right place at the right time and possessing an appropriate level of quality.  \nThis value will be compromised if these factors fail to meet customer expectations.  For \nexample, if a product is damaged and its quality is compromised so its value will be \nreduced.  Similarly, value can be reduced if goods are not available at the right time or if \nthey are not in the right place.  In the grocery retail environment the value of a good is \nrepresented by its intended sale price.  Any loss of value in a product is assumed here to \nbe represented through a mark down in its sales price.   \n \nThe most extreme reduction in value is when it reduces to zero by writing off the product \nwhen it can no longer be sold.  This can happen for the reasons described above and also \nwhen goods cannot be physically accounted for.  Goods that cannot be accounted for will \nbe identified when there is a discrepancy between book stock and physical stock.  The \nbook stock is the record of those goods held by the company and calculated as follows: \n \nBook stock = Results from last physical stock count + net movements  \n \nwhere, \n \nnet movements = (purchases + incoming transfers)-(sales + outgoing transfers) \n \nDiscrepancies between book stock and physical stock will come to light following a \nphysical audit of a company\u2019s goods, such as a stock take.  In a stock take the goods \nphysically recorded in the audit are compared to the book stock and differences are \nrecorded.   \n \nA retailer incurs a loss when a good is sold for less than its intended price, i.e. there is \nsome intended sales income that was not realised and also when the intended sales income \nfrom products cannot be realised because of stock loss.  It is proposed that these losses are \nwhat lie at the heart of the shrinkage issue.  Therefore shrinkage will be delimited here as \nrelating to: \nIntended sales income that was not and cannot be realised. \n \nThis definition is intended to be clear and simple.  This should allow the concept of \nshrinkage to be more easily communicated to the broad range of people that need to be \nengaged in addressing it.  \n Page 5 \n \n \nClarification and Refinement of Contextual Issues that \nInfluence Shrinkage \n \nSeveral perspectives exist on the nature of shrinkage and any measurement system will be \nguided by the principles employed in its design.  It is common for these guiding principles \nto be unspoken and for a measurement system to develop from them intuitively.  In order \nto treat shrinkage measurement in a rational manner it is necessary to first consider the \nkey perspectives that relate to retail shrinkage and explore lines of difference in how \nshrinkage can be viewed.  Only once these perspectives have been addressed and \ndecisions made on which guiding principles to adopt can measures be designed and \ndeployed. \n \nIn order to clarify the debate on the contextual issues that influence shrinkage \nmeasurement, these issues were summarised into four categories, namely: \n \n\u2022 Stewardship and performance improvement. \n\u2022 Cost reduction and sales improvement. \n\u2022 Local effects of systemic issues. \n\u2022 The detailed nature of retailing. \n \nNaturally there are limits to what can be achieved by reducing the debate to these four \ncategories and these categories will no doubt benefit from refinement over time.  However \nthe merit in introducing this perspective on the subject is to introduce a series of lenses for \nviewing the richness of the subject.  Each category is introduced and discussed below.   \n \nStewardship and Performance Improvement \nShrinkage measurement can be viewed from the perspectives of \u2018stewardship\u2019 and \n\u2018performance improvement\u2019.  At their extremes, these two issues sit at opposite ends of a \nspectrum.  The difference between them is that stewardship considers \u2018what is\u2019 while \nperformance improvement considers \u2018what could have been.\u2019   \n \nStewardship implies the safe and conservative running of an operation along prescribed \nlines.  Shareholders oblige the management team to be stewards of their invested capital \nand an accounting view of shrinkage is therefore typically geared towards stewardship.  \nFor example the stewardship perspective requires the value of goods to be conservatively \nrepresented as the lower of purchase cost or net realisable value.   \n \nPerformance improvement implies delivering change to maximise return.  Shareholders \noblige management teams to maximise their return on investment, that is to protect and \nimprove the value of their shareholding in a company and to ensure the company\u2019s long \nterm profitability.  In order to achieve this, the management team need to identify areas of \nsales and cost underperformance and direct effort to resolve them.  Measurement from \nthis perspective seeks to highlight forgone profits that result from shrinkage.   \n \n Page 6 \nThe common ground between these two perspectives is that they both emphasise that \ndecisions need to be based on reliable information.  A common measurement system \ncould satisfy both sets of requirements through collating and distributing performance \ndata, which can then be manipulated to meet both sets of needs.  In doing so, the \nmanagers would fulfil their dual roles as corporate stewards and as business leaders.   \n \nCost Reduction and Sales Improvement \nShrinkage is a cost, and reducing this cost generally presents a profit opportunity in the \ngrocery retail industry.  Some observers and practitioners view shrinkage simply in terms \nof reducing this cost, however the profit opportunity available from effective shrinkage \nmanagement extends further.  Additional profit opportunities exist from increasing sales \nthrough improving the characteristics that shoppers seek.  These characteristics include:   \n \n\u2022 Value for money shopping. \n\u2022 On-Shelf Availability. \n\u2022 One stop shopping. \n\u2022 Good shopping experience. \n\u2022 Safe visit. \n \nEach retailer will have their own marketing mix that responds to and satisfies these \ncharacteristics in a variety of ways that are designed to best serve their market niche.  \nShrinkage reduction can affect these characteristics, resulting in an opportunity to increase \nsales.  A description of the sales improvement opportunities associated with shrinkage \nreduction is presented in Table I below. \n \nTake in Table I  \n \nIn addition to the sales growth opportunities associated with reducing shrinkage, there are \nsales growth opportunities linked with operating a level of planned shrinkage.  For \nexample, optimal sales for some products result from having a quantity of unsold \nmerchandise which are written off and disposed (Smith and Achabal, 1998).  Recent \nexamples of retail policies deployed despite increases in shrinkage include: \n \n\u2022 Self scanning \u2013 a method where the shopper scans their own goods and pays for \ntheir shopping at an unstaffed checkout.  This eliminates the need for a checkout \noperator and therefore reduces the retailer\u2019s staff costs.  An example of the way \nself scan is used is for the shopper to take their basket of goods to an unstaffed \ncheckout, scan and pack the goods themselves at the checkout and pay with cash \nor credit card at a payment point.  Failure to scan some items seems to increase \nwith this method, meaning that the retailer needs to offset the saving in staff costs \nagainst an increase in shrinkage. \n\u2022 Fresh produce promotion \u2013 Some retailers differentiate themselves by having a \nfull and well stocked range of fresh produce available at all times, which can lead \nto increased wastage.   \n \nOverall, the management of shrinkage needs to be recognised as having an effect on both \nretail costs and retail sales.  It also raises the opportunity for profit enhancement through \nboth reducing costs and providing the opportunity to enhance sales, which was an effect \nseen in project work by The Gillette Company and Tesco (Beck, Chapman and Peacock, \n Page 7 \n2003).  The implication is that effective shrinkage management needs to consider several \nfactors that affect overall profitability, meaning that each factor needs to be measured. \n \nLocal Effects of Systemic Issues \nShrinkage may be considered as a series of unrelated local problems or as an issue that \noccurs as a result of a series of disparate factors coming together.  That is, viewed in \nisolation, shrinkage incidents appear unconnected from one another and the response is to \ndeal with them locally as and when they occur.  However if incidents were viewed more \nbroadly then common causes can be identified and then addressed through changes at a \npolicy level.  This systemic approach to shrinkage management points to viewing \nshrinkage as the symptom of a range of causes and to judge the influence of each cause \nusing clear-cut criteria to inform decision-making and the selection of corrective actions.   \n \nTake for example the response when a case of bottles is dropped in the back of store.  \nTaken in isolation, a localised view of shrinkage will result in the employee who dropped \nthe case being reprimanded and the broken items cleared away.  Viewed from a systemic \nperspective, this same incident is seen as being the consequence of several factors that \ncombined in a critical way at the time of the incident.  For example, the case of bottles \nwas half full and unstable; The employee was in a hurry as they had been called away \nfrom shelf replenishment to serve on the busy checkouts; When the case of bottles was \ndropped, the employee was holding the case in one hand while using the other hand to \nmake space on an already full warehouse shelf.  None of these factors were individually \ncritical but they conspired in a way that led to the incident.  The ability to evaluate this \nincident and others like it provides the means to make decisions that can remove the \nunderlying causes of shrinkage, preventing future loss from occurring. \n \nIn order to get a more rounded comprehension of shrinkage, the systemic perspective \ntakes a broad view of events that considers issues relating to corporate policy that \nincludes: product design; replenishment quantity and frequency; facility layout; \nrecruitment, and; staff discipline. \n \nThe perspective of shrinkage as a systemic issue recognises that there can be significant \ndistance and time-lag between where and when the causes of shrinkage were introduced, \nwhere the loss occurred and where and when the effect materialises.  Therefore in order to \nunderstand and manage shrinkage it is necessary to look across a business and the life \ncycle of the elements to be found there.  The life cycle of the various elements to a retail \nbusiness can be broken into three horizons of long-term, medium-term and short-term.  \nLong terms issues are those that are strategic in nature, typically designed in the \ninfrastructure and are very difficult to change, such as the location and shape of a \nbuilding.  In the medium term there are some significant decisions that that are made \nwithin the constraints set down by design or strategy.  Short term issues are tactical in \nnature and relate to the day-to-day running of operations.  Table II below brings together \nthe key elements of a retailing business that influence shrinkage and presents some of the \nkey activities that occur within each of the three time horizons.   \n \nTake in Table II \n \nTable II provides a framework for introducing a systemic perspective on shrinkage \nmanagement.  Instead of seeking to attribute the cause of an incident to one element of the \n Page 8 \ntable, the aim is to consider how the various aspects of the business affect shrinkage.  This \nmeans that when it comes to addressing issues, the right parts of the business can be \ntargeted at the right time.   \n \nLooking across the business there is a need to gather data on the performance of those \nactivities that have an impact on shrinkage and this information needs to be brought \ntogether so it can be considered in its totality.  Taking a store as an example, the \nmeasurement systems would assess long term issues linked to store design, medium term \nissues like the design of store procedures and short term issues like how these procedures \nare being followed.  The role of this measurement system is to report results, such as the \non the use of good practice, track trends over time and direct resources to where they will \nbe most effective.  The likelihood is that these resources will be managed at a local level, \ne.g. in-store, so the information needs to be specific and advice on what actions to take \nneeds to be specific and relevant to that operation.  In summary, the macro issues need to \nbe deconstructed so they can guide timely intervention at the local level. \n \nAn example of where a systemic view of shrinkage is likely to benefit retail organisations \nis to use it to consider malicious losses, the loss due to internal and external theft and \nsupplier fraud.  At the localised level, success can be viewed as the detection of incidents, \napprehension of perpetrators and ensuring the matter is dealt with in accordance to \ncompany policy.  Good management would be seen as the ability to increase detection, \napprehension and successful resolution.  The systemic view on such incidents is not at \nodds with this approach, indeed effective and consistent execution of policy remains key.  \nWhere the systemic view on malicious loss differs is to engage a higher order of critical \nthinking and evaluate why malicious loss occurs.  A difficulty with asking the \u2018why?\u2019 \nquestion is that it opens the door to a wealth of ideas that need to be carefully unpacked \nand considered.  The multitude of divergent theories on malicious loss can be organised \nusing Marcus\u2019s general taxonomic framework of general counterproductive behaviour \n(Marcus, 2001 reported in Marcus and Schuler, 2004).  This framework is depicted in \nFigure 1 below.   \n \nTake in Figure 1. \n \nThe framework crosses two dichotomous distinctions: person verses situation; and control \nverses motivation which provides four quadrants, each of which are summarised under a \nheading.   \n \nMarcus and Schuler (2004) cite Hollinger and Clark\u2019s work on Theft by Employees \n(Hollinger and Clark, 1983) as being an example of research that sits within the \ntheoretical area of situation \u2013 control that they term \u2018Opportunity\u2019.  This allows the \nsystemic nature of shrinkage to be illustrated by considering internal theft from the \nopportunity perspective.  To provide this illustration an opportunity is taken as being a \nsituation that facilitates theft.  The management challenge therefore lies in removing such \nsituations.  A systemic response to this challenge can be organised along the lines of the \nframework presented in Table II above.  A list of actions needed to remove opportunity \nfor internal theft and therefore reduce shrinkage is shown below in Table III.   \n \nTake in Table III \n \n Page 9 \nThe list of actions presented in Table III is not definitive and is intended to merely \nillustrate the point that actions are needed across the organisation and that these \ninterventions occur at different times as well as places.   \n \nThe relevance of this way of thinking on how shrinkage is measured is brought out by \nconsidering the response to catching a member of staff stealing.  In the localised way of \nthinking the response is limited to having the person dismissed and an appropriate metric \nthat would reflect this way of thinking would be measure the number of staff dismissals.  \nIn the systemic way of thinking, the incident would be evaluated in the particular store to \njudge the effectiveness of the local management team in implementing practices and \nprocedures.  At a wider level, details of the incident would be collected but the major \ndifference lies in the way they are used.  In this case the details of the incident are added \nto a pool of data, which is used to evaluate the validity of: the theoretical base that was \ndrawn on; the frameworks used to operationalise the theories; the policies designed to \nremove the opportunity for theft by staff; and the effectiveness with which those policies \nwere deployed.   \n \nThe Detailed Nature of Retailing \nThe popular retailing adage that, \u2018retail is detail\u2019 resonates particularly well when it comes \nto shrinkage measurement.  Shrinkage skews towards particular products (Clarke, 1999); \nlocations (Bernstein, 1980); processes; people; and times (Beck and Chapman, 2003) so in \norder to identify where shrinkage is concentrated, data is required.  This data comes at a \nprice, i.e. the cost of gathering data, analysing it and disseminating information.  \nTherefore a trade off exists between the benefit that data can bring and its associated \ncosts.   \n \nAn illustration of the problems that arise without data is found by returning to the issue \nraised earlier relating to industry surveys and the difficulties in attributing shrinkage to \nparticular causes.  A common practice when addressing shrinkage is to classify it using a \nset of four headings.  Although the exact terms used differ between authors, the following \nheadings used by Beck et al (2003) are representative: \n \n\u2022 Process failures. \n\u2022 Internal theft. \n\u2022 External theft. \n\u2022 Inter-company fraud. \n \nAttributing known losses to these classifications is fairly straightforward.  The problem \narises with the inclination of business and academia to apportion a value for total \nshrinkage, i.e. known and unknown shrinkage, to these categories.  Instead of an honest \nanswer along the lines of, \u201cRetailing is a complex business, there are many mechanisms \nthrough which shrinkage can occur and we don\u2019t know which ones apply in this instance,\u201d \nthere is a tendency to use judgement \/ estimation \/ guess work to apportion unknown \nshrinkage to each category.  Despite the fundamental weakness, this erratic approach is \nthe default mechanism all too often used to inform management thinking and direct \ninvestments in loss prevention solutions when faced by a lack of hard data.  \n \nOn balance, the benefits appear compelling for collecting data and converting unknown \nshrinkage into known shrinkage then deploying this data to direct corrective action.  There \n Page 10 \nis cost associated with implementing the systems required to gather and process the data \nhowever the insight this data provides into the nature and location of shrinkage provides \nthe only sound basis for management action. \n \nImplications of Contextual Issues for Shrinkage \nMeasurement \nEarly drafts of this review of contextual issues surrounding shrinkage were presented to \nand critiqued by the review panel (as described above in the section on methodology).  \nThis panel examined the work to check factual accuracy, critique the way that the work \nwas drawn together and to consider the implications of the review.   \n \nBroad support was given to the usefulness of framing the debate on shrinkage under the \nfour headings presented above.  This support was given as the headings allowed the \ndebate on measurement to address fundamental and specific points whilst helping to retain \nthe context needed when considering shrinkage.   \n \nUnder stewardship and performance improvement, organisations report their shrinkage at \neither retail sales value or cost price but there is no consensus on whether one method is \nsuperior to the other.  The common view is that each method has its merits but the key is \nto declare which approach has been used and to view the result accordingly.  This view \noverlaps with the effect of shrinkage on both the costs and sales income of an \norganisation.  The implication for measurement is that there is a need for reliable and \ntimely information which can be interpreted to show how shrinkage impacts profitability \nthrough reducing sales income and to show how shrinkage affects profitability through \nincreased costs.   \n \nWhilst each legal entity along a supply chain has responsibilities to its own stakeholders, \nthe inter-firm nature of shrinkage means that companies need to work together.  Shrinkage \ncuts across lines of managerial control and a strong case exists for viewing retail \nshrinkage as a systemic issue that spans the whole supply chain from raw material to \ncheckout sale to product return.  The implication is that visibility of performance across \nthe supply chain is needed to view shrinkage from this broader context in order to identify \nwhere corrective action should be focussed.  In order to guide management action, data \nneeds to be available at the lowest level of granularity, that is by product; by location; and \nby time, and for this data to be shared with internal and external stakeholders.  Whilst \nthere is a cost associated with acquiring the capability to implement such a measurement \nsystem and to gather and share data, the implication is that this approach is necessary to \nconvert unknown shrinkage into known shrinkage and to inform decision making.   \n \nThese findings were presented to a seminar attended by 210 people held as part of the \n2004 ECR Europe congress in Brussels, a mainly practitioner gathering.  It is difficult to \ndraw firm conclusions from the reaction given at such gatherings however a view of the \npractical implications of the research can be drawn from the feedback provided by \nattendees.  An overall rating of the content of the seminar scored 4.4 out of 5.  In context \nthis gave the seminar the highest score out of the 12 seminars delivered on a variety of \ntopics at the congress.  Whilst this is a very rough instrument, this feedback suggests that \nthis work has merit in the direction it takes the debate on shrinkage measurement, at least \nfrom a practitioner perspective. \n Page 11 \nConclusions \nShrinkage affects shoppers in a number of ways including reduced on-shelf availability, \nreduced assortment and defensive merchandising.  None of these provide shopper \nsatisfaction, hence sales are depressed and profits foregone.  In addition to lost sales, \nshrinkage also affects the profits of grocery retailers and FMCG manufacturers through \nassociated additional cost. \n \nThe scale of the impact on shoppers and on profit is sufficient to warrant senior \nmanagement attention and investment in a performance measurement system to measure \nshrinkage.  Such a system will fail to inform management decisions if it does not address \nthe contextual issues that influence shrinkage measurement, namely: \n \n\u2022 Stewardship and performance improvement. \n\u2022 Cost reduction and sales improvement. \n\u2022 Local effects of systemic issues. \n\u2022 The detailed nature of retailing. \n \nIn particular, shrinkage measurement needs to be capable of capturing data in a way that \nallows it to be aggregated and disaggregated without losing its integrity, allowing \nalternative costing practices to be applied where necessary.  Analysis of this data needs to \nfactor in the systemic nature of shrinkage in order to attribute effect to cause and highlight \nareas of unsatisfactory performance and opportunities for improvement.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nBamfield, J.
