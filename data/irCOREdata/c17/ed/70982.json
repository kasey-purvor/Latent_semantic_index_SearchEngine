Focusing on those convicted of arson (n=45,915), blackmail \n(n=5,774), kidnapping (n=7,291) and threats to kill (n=9,816) in England and \nWales (1979-2001), we examine the specialisation and sequencing of these \ncrimes in relation to the risk of subsequent homicide.  \n \n All four offences have a heightened likelihood of subsequent homicide \ncompared to the general population.  Arson, blackmail and threats to kill have \na similar homicide risk (0.8%) after a 20-year follow-up; in contrast, \nkidnapping has a higher likelihood (1.0%). Sequencing is also relevant, with \nthose convicted of more than one type of serious offence being at higher risk \nof a homicide conviction. \n \nAdditionally, there is evidence of specialisation (particularly for \narsonists) among serious offenders who recidivate. \n \nKeywords \nArson, blackmail, kidnapping, threats to kill, homicide, reconviction  \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \n Much of the criminological focus in recent years has been on high \nfrequency\/low tariff offences where the versatility of most offenders\u2019 behaviour \nhas been identified. With these offenders the case for specialisation has been \nlimited although elsewhere (Soothill et al., 2000) we have argued that the \nconceptualisation of the issue needs further development. In contrast, there \nhas been much less criminological focus on low frequency\/high tariff offences. \nThe exception over the past decade has been the increased interest in sexual \noffending. In relation to other high tariff serious crime, the focus is usually on \none type of offence, such as arson (e.g. Soothill et al., 2004) and there is the \napparent criminological neglect of many such crimes, such as blackmail or \nthreats to kill. More pertinently, there seems to have been little discussion \nabout possible comparisons and inter-relationships between different types of \nserious offences. Are those convicted of kidnapping more likely than those \nconvicted of blackmail to go on to be reconvicted for homicide, for example? \nSimilarly, are those convicted of, say, both arson and threats to kill more likely \nto go on to be convicted of homicide than those convicted of only one type of \nserious crime? The questions are important ones both for theoretical and \npractical reasons. \n \n In thinking theoretically about serious offenders who recidivate one \nneeds to ask how many types of offending domain they occupy. This question \nrelates to the fraught issue of specialisation. Are kidnappers distinct from \nblackmailers? Are those convicted of threats to kill (a potentially serious \noffence against a person) totally distinct from those convicted of arson (a \n 3\nserious offence on property)? And so on. If they are distinct, this would \nperhaps suggest that one needs different types of theoretical explanations for \ndifferent types of serious crimes. In contrast, if there is quite considerable \noverlap between those committing different types of serious offences \u2013 that is, \nthose who are convicted of blackmail also tend to get convicted of kidnapping \nduring their criminal careers, then there is perhaps more scope for a more \ngeneral explanation, such as the low self-control approach espoused by \nGottfredson and Hirschi (1990) who have espoused a general theory of crime. \n \nThis paper is a demonstration project probing the overlap between \ndifferent kinds of serious offences. It is a demonstration rather than a \ndefinitive study simply in terms of probing whether a largely uncharted journey \nis worth undertaking. \n \nCertainly the overlap issue may be important for explanation. However, \nthe practical issue is a different but related one. If, for example, someone with \na kidnapping and a blackmail conviction is more likely to kill subsequently \nrather than  someone with  a single blackmail conviction, then one can make \na better appraisal of the type of risk that is at issue and the type of support or \nsurveillance that may be needed. \n \nPrevious literature  \n There seems little work that considers the overlap between different \ntypes of serious crime. However, we have previously ventured into this area. \nFor example, we found in a matched case-control study of precursors to \n 4\nmurder that \u201ca previous conviction for kidnapping was shown to be a \nstatistically significant risk factor for murder, when compared against general \ncriminal controls and against violent controls\u201d (Soothill et al., 2002: 33). \nSimilarly, for blackmail, \u201cthose with a blackmail conviction were over five times \nas likely to become murderers as the general controls\u201d (Ibid. p.34]. \n \n More recently Liu et al. (in press) examined the time from the first \nconviction for kidnapping to some specific subsequent serious crimes: a \nsubsequent kidnap, murder, manslaughter, and rape of a female. Using \nsurvival analysis procedures, this work estimated that 5 out of every 100 \nkidnap offenders convicted of kidnapping will be reconvicted for this offence. \nIn contrast, one in every 100 kidnap offenders will be convicted of homicide \nafter 20 years and close to 2 out of every 100 will be convicted of rape of a \nfemale in 20 years. It was further demonstrated that kidnappers are over 30 \ntimes more likely than males in the general population to be convicted of \nhomicide and four times more likely than sex offenders. \n \nFurther, it seemed from our earlier research (Soothill et al., 2002) that \nthose who were subsequently convicted of murder following a kidnapping \nconviction seemed to be much closer in time to the earlier kidnapping \nconviction compared, for instance, to those who were convicted of blackmail \nwhere the subsequent killing often seemed to be more distant in time. \n \n In brief, this earlier work certainly suggests that those convicted of \nkidnapping or blackmail are at greater risk of being subsequently convicted of \n 5\nmurder, but it falls short of comparing systematically various kinds of serious \noffences and probing the possible inter-relationships between them. In a \nhierarchy of potential dangerousness, how do offenders committing various \nkinds of serious offences measure up? Also to what extent is there an overlap \nbetween serious offences \u2013 in brief, do offenders who commit these types of \noffences specialise in certain types of offending or is their serious criminal \nbehaviour much more versatile? \n \nAims of the current paper \n This paper probes the issues of comparison and possible inter-\nrelationships by considering four specific types of serious crime \u2013 arson, \nblackmail, kidnapping and threats to kill. The choice of these offences was \noccasioned by three factors. Firstly, an earlier study identified that among \ngeneral offenders with a previous criminal history these offences indicated an \nincreased risk of murder (Soothill et al. 2002, especially Table 10). Secondly, \nthese are seemingly very different types of serious offences and, finally, the \navailability of the data for these four offences. We refer to these four offences \nas \u201cfocus offences\u201d.  Other offences could certainly claim attention but, as \nindicated earlier, this is a demonstration rather than a definitive study.  \n \n Certainly these four chosen offences do seem very different. While \nthere will be variants, \u2018kidnapping\u2019 seems essentially a \u2018hands-on\u2019 potentially \nviolent offence with face-to-face interaction, \u2018blackmail\u2019 seems a more \u2018hands-\noff\u2019 offence with little or no face-to-face interaction, \u2018threats to kill\u2019 seems a \nmore verbal or written type of aggression which may or may not involve face-\n 6\nto-face interaction, and \u2018arson\u2019 is a serious property which may or may not \nendanger human life. \n The choice of considering the likelihood of subsequent homicide \nprovided continuity with our earlier work (Soothill et al. 2002). However, the \nchoice of homicide (murder or manslaughter) rather than any other offences \nwas also for reasons of both parsimony and pragmatism. There are, of \ncourse, other social harms, such as rape, which are potentially relevant, but \nthe very low conviction rate for this offence, to take this example, may lead to \na serious underestimate of this particular danger. By focusing on just one \nsubsequent serious offence (namely, homicide) beyond the four serious \noffences already under consideration, we hope this will aid the clarity of the \npresentation. Pragmatically, in considering potential dangerousness, the \nrelevance of a future homicide seems unquestionable. \n \nThe questions  \nThe two main questions posed are straightforward ones: \n1) For each of the four serious offences under consideration \u2013 the focus \noffences - what proportions go on to be reconvicted for the same offence, or \nget reconvicted for one of the other three serious offences, or for homicide \n(murder or manslaughter).  Essentially this question is focusing on offence \nspecialisation within each offence, and within the four focus offences .  It is \nalso concerned with escalation \u2013 how many escalate their activity to homicide, \nWe will investigate this in two ways \u2013 firstly, by an uncontrolled descriptive \nanalysis, which does not take into account the different follow-up times of our \ncohorts of serious offenders and, secondly, controlling for follow-up time and \n 7\nfor time at risk.  The latter analysis allows us to examine the speed of \nreconviction for the most serious type of reconviction, namely homicide.   \n2) For all cases in the dataset, are certain combinations and sequences of \nfocus convictions risk factors for subsequent homicide? Again, we investigate \nthis in two ways \u2013 firstly by means of a descriptive  tabular analysis which \ndoes not control for differential follow up and time at risk, and then through a \nsurvival analysis which controls for these factors. \n \nDatasets and methods \nThe study of serious offences is often doomed by the numerical lack of \ncases. However, this study does not suffer from this problem. We used the \nOffenders Index, which is an administrative dataset which consists of records \nof convictions for all standard list offences for all offenders in England and \nWales since 1963.  Extracts from the dataset are available for research \npurposes.  \n \nThe datasets were constructed in two stages. First, we consider all \nthose offenders convicted between 1979 and 2001 in England and Wales of \narson, blackmail, kidnapping or threats to kill. Four separate datasets were \nconstructed by following two restrictions.  First of all, we wished to ensure that \nour offenders were convicted of their first focus offence (one of the four types \nabove) between 1979 and 2001. Thus, those offenders who were convicted of \nany of the serious crimes of arson, blackmail or threats to kill, or of homicide \nbetween 1963 and 1978 (inclusive)1 were discarded. For example, a person \nwho had been convicted of arson for the first time in 1977, and then convicted \n 8\nof blackmail in 1980 would be removed from both the arson dataset and the \nblackmail dataset2. \n \nFor each of the four datasets, we then defined the target conviction for \nan offender to be the first conviction of the offence of interest; thus the target \nconviction for an individual in the blackmail dataset would be the first \nblackmail conviction.   \n \nA second restriction was then applied. All those known to have been \nconvicted of homicide prior to or as a co-conviction to the target conviction \nwere eliminated from the relevant data set. The reason for that is we were \ninterested in first \u2013time subsequent homicide following a particular serious \noffence . \n \nThe resulting four datasets were arson (n=45,915), blackmail \n(n=5,774), kidnapping (n=7,291) and threats to kill (n=9,816). As they were \nseparate datasets, a person could be part of more than one dataset. In fact, \nthere is overlap between the datasets; of the 67,052 persons in the four \ndatasets (eliminating overlaps), 1,702 persons (or 2.5%) were in two or more \ndatasets. \n \nEach dataset is sizeable, but the limitation of each dataset, however, is \nthe paucity of the information on these offenders beyond their criminal history. \nThe OI database, first started in 1963, provides information on gender, age at \nconviction and previous criminal history (that is, back to 1963). However, \n 9\nthere is little or no detail on the nature of the crime, for instance. An exception \nis with arson where we can distinguish between offences that were \nconsidered to endanger life and those that were not. \n \nThe second stage was to combine the four datasets into a single \ndataset. This resulted in a dataset of 67,052 offenders in total.  In this dataset, \nwe define the target conviction to be the first conviction of any of the four \nserious focus crimes.  The construction of this dataset allowed us to examine \ntemporal sequences of serious crime convictions and the subsequent risk of \nfirst time homicide following these sequences.  \n \nThis study is primarily concerned with reconviction. With this data, \nthere are two methodological problems to confront. The first relates to follow-\nup time \u2013 those offenders having their first focus conviction in 2000 have only \na limited follow up compared to those having a first focus conviction in 1979. \nThe second problem relates to time spent in custody. Serious offenders are \nlikely to spend part of their follow-up time in custody, and this is time then they \nare not at risk (or more exactly, at substantially reduced risk) of committing a \nfurther serious offence.  \n \nWe have therefore carried out two analyses for each of the stages \ndescribed above.  We start the analysis of each stage by carrying out a \nstraightforward descriptive analysis, examining the numbers of reconvictions \nof various offences without adjusting for follow-up time and time at risk.  We \nthen use survival analysis techniques to adjust for follow-up time and for time \n 10\nspent in custody. For the individual datasets at the first stage, we examine \nKaplan-Meier survival curves; for the combined dataset (where we wish to \nexamine risk factors) we carry out a Cox proportional hazards analysis,   \n \nAdjustment for time spent in custody is not straightforward, for while we \nhave a record of sentence awarded including the length of any custodial \nsentence there is no indication of the actual time served since conviction on \nthe OI data. Again certain assumptions must be made.  For the target \nconviction and for every conviction after that date which had a custodial \nsentence, we make an estimate of the custodial time served from the \nsentence length. We then adjust the time at risk by the sum of these times \nspent in custody.  There are various unpredictable circumstances that can \nchange the imprisonment time, such as whether the offenders will get \nremission or not, whether they get parole, and whether it is at the first, second \nor later opportunity. We estimate the time served as some fraction of the \nsentence length, taking the fraction to be 0.33 in this paper.  \n \nBy making this estimate for time at risk, there will be some individuals \nwho are convicted of a homicide while our estimate says that they will still be \nserving time in custody. We deem these convictions pseudo-reconvictions. \nThey are assumed not to be true reconvictions, but will relate to offences \ncommitted before the appropriate conviction, but discovered or admitted to \nlater when the offender is in custody.  \n \n \n 11\n Results \n Using the four separate datasets constructed as the first stage, Table 1 \nshows the subsequent reconvictions for the four offences of arson, blackmail, \nkidnapping and threats to kill in terms of whether they were subsequently \nconvicted for any of these focus offences, or of homicide. This preliminary \nanalysis provides both clues and concerns. The concerns are the \nmethodological ones that length of follow-up and time at risk have not been \nsystematically taken into account. Nevertheless, using the four separate \ndatasets with what was expected as an average follow-up period of around \nten years, Table 1 presents some clues for a judge who is sentencing a \nperson who has not been previously convicted of the particular offence of \ninterest.  \n \n(Table 1 around here) \n \n Our questions which relate to proportions, specialisation and the \nlikelihood of a homicide reconviction have some preliminary answers: \n1. Proportions. For each of the four separate offences (or datasets), an \nimportant minority go on to be convicted of at least one or more of the \nfive serious offences of interest. The cumulative numbers of persons \nconvicted for at least one of the four focus offences, shown as the \npenultimate column in Table 1, range from 9.57% for those convicted \nof arson for the first time to 5.46% of those convicted of kidnapping for \nthe first time.  \n 12\n2. Specialised serious offending. The shaded diagonal in Table 1 shows \nthe numbers and proportions who are reconvicted of the same type of \noffence as their original target conviction. Table 1 demonstrates that, \nwithin the four focus offences, the offenders tend to specialise in the \ntype of subsequent offence they commit, by being more likely to be \nreconvicted of the same offence than one of the other three focus \noffences . Arsonists seem the most specialised with around 1 in 12 of \nthose convicted of arson being later reconvicted for arson again. For \nthe other three offences (blackmail, kidnapping and threats to kill), \naround 1 in 25 are reconvicted for the same offence again.  \n3. Subsequent homicide. Homicide can be regarded as the most serious \nreconviction and the four focus offences \u2013 arson, blackmail, kidnapping \nand threats to kill \u2013 have quite remarkably the same proportion \n(approaching 0.6%) \u2013 that is, just over 1 in 200 - who are reconvicted \nfor homicide. However, the figures are uncontrolled and there is no \nfocus on the speed of reconviction for homicide. \n \nWhile a useful guide, Table 1 has some limitations. The final column in \nTable 1 shows that the average follow-up time (in years) varies quite markedly \nfor the four offences. Arson and blackmail offenders have the longest follow-\nup on average of around 12 years \u2013 this is because there has been a fall in \nthe numbers convicted of these offences over the follow-up period. In \ncontrast, threats to kill and kidnapping (with average follow-ups of 9 and 8 \nyears respectively) have much lower follow-up periods; again the explanation \nrelates to changes in the number of convictions over the follow-up period - for \n 13\nthese two offences the number of convictions have risen over the follow-up \nperiod. This feature is demonstrated in Figure 1 which shows the first-time \nconvictions for the four offences during the period under investigation. \n \n(Figure 1 around here) \n \nThe other limitation of Table 1 as discussed above is that there is no \ncontrol for periods genuinely at risk.  \n.  \n Following Liu et al. (in press) the differential follow-up periods can be \ndealt with by using a survival analysis technique. Using time at risk rather than \ncalendar time, we estimate a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for each of our four \noffences, which gives an estimate of the proportion of offenders not \nreconvicted of homicide at any time t after reconviction. Offenders contribute \nto the analysis from when they are convicted of their target offence up to \nwhen they get a homicide reconviction or until the end of the study in 2001, \nwhichever is earlier. Nevertheless, there are still certain assumptions that \nneed to be recognised. Most importantly, the procedure assumes that those \nconvicted in the early years (thus with long follow-up periods) will have similar \ncharacteristics to those convicted in the later years (with shorter follow-up \nperiods). However, this assumption of no social change seems reasonable in \nthese datasets.  \n \nFigure 2 shows the estimated homicide reconviction survival curves for \nthe four focus offences. It usefully demonstrates that the different offences \n 14\nhave different trajectories. At the twenty-year point, arson, blackmail and \nthreats to kill all eventually reach very similar estimated proportions, that is, \naround 0.8%. Kidnapping shows a different trajectory with an estimated  rate \nof homicide reconviction at 1% (roughly, one in a 100) in a 20-year period at \nrisk. Kidnapping, moreover, has a more rapid gradient and there were no \nmore homicides in the second half of the follow-up. The gradients are also \nmeaningful for the other offences with arson having a constant slope \nthroughout the follow-up, while threats to kill and blackmail have intermediate \ntrajectories with no further homicides after 12 and 15 years respectively. In \nother words, the gradients provide some clues as to whether the risk of \nhomicide remains constant, falls or rises over periods of time. This feature has \nrelevance for the length of supervision which may be required for different \noffences. \n \n(Figure 2 around here) \n \nHowever, despite using the survival analysis technique and controlling \nfor actual time at risk, there is still a concern about comparing the four \ndatasets. After all, there are 1,702 persons who are in two or more of the \ndatasets. Perhaps these persons contribute disproportionately to the homicide \nreconviction rate and may be the reason why the reconviction rates for \nhomicide look so similar for the four offences. \n \nAt stage two, we now consider the combined dataset of 67,052 \npersons for whom the offence of arson, blackmail, kidnapping or threats to kill \n 15\nfirst occurred in 1979 or after. Table 2 presents the outcome in terms of \nsubsequent homicide and reveals that the overall homicide rate is 0.52% \n(roughly 1 in 200). However, the important feature of Table 2 is that it shows \nthe effect of (1) being convicted of one of these focus offences on two or more \noccasions (but without being convicted of one of the other serious offences) \nand of (2) being convicted of two or more different kinds of serious focus \noffences. \n \n(Table 2 around here) \n \nFirst, considering those who were convicted of one of these serious \noffences on two or more occasions, the pattern is different for arson \ncompared to the other three offences. With arson, the chances of being \nconvicted of homicide almost doubles when the person has two or more two \noccasions with an arson conviction (from 0.48% after being convicted for \narson on just one occasion to 0.84% after being convicted for arson on more \nthan one occasion). With the other three offences, the proportions \nsubsequently convicted for homicide actually declines \u2013 albeit only marginally \nfor kidnapping - when a person is convicted of one of these offences on two or \nmore occasions. This seems to be counter-intuitive but one can perhaps \nrecognise that it is conceivable that more threats to kill are evidence of a \nlower likelihood of subsequent homicide \u2013 as we suggest elsewhere (Soothill \net al., 2007), perhaps dogs that continue to bark don\u2019t bite. However, also of \ncourse, by the time that a person has been convicted of a second serious \noffence, the length of the follow-up will on average be much shorter. This \n 16\nfeature is shown in the last column of Table 2. For each offence, those with \ntwo or more convictions have on average a shorter follow-up period than \nthose with just one relevant conviction.  \n \n Now moving on to the offenders who have been convicted between \n1979 and 2001 of two or more of the four focus offences being considered. \nFor almost every combination shown in Table 2 there is at least a doubling of \nthe likelihood of being subsequently convicted of homicide compared with the \nfigures when the offender has been convicted of just one of these serious \noffences. The exception is the combination of \u2018threats to kill and blackmail\u2019 \nwhere none of the 103 individuals convicted of this combination was \nsubsequently convicted of homicide. This outcome supports the earlier finding \nthat, for both threats to kill and blackmail, the likelihood of a subsequent \nhomicide declines if offenders are convicted more than once for these \noffences. \n \n There seems to be a further curious twist to Table 2. None of the \npersons who were convicted of three or four of these serious offences was \nreconvicted for homicide. However, the numbers are small \u2013 a total of 53 \npersons \u2013 and the average follow-up period for each of these combinations is, \nnot surprisingly, comparatively short.  \n  \n Table 2 has focused on the various combinations of serious convictions \nduring the period 1979 and 2001. A feature which Table 2 currently masks is \nthe sequencing of the serious offences when more than one kind of serious \n 17\noffence is involved. Table 3 attempts to do this. Where a serious offence \noccurs at one court appearance and another serious offence is convicted on \nanother occasion, the two events are separated by a slash line (e.g. A\/T); \nwhere the two serious offences are convicted on the same occasion, then \nthere is no such separation. \n \n(Table 3 around here) \n \n The number of homicides are comparatively few in each combination \nso the problem of chance fluctuations is heightened. Mostly there are no \nsubsequent homicides. Nevertheless, tentatively one could point to two \npossible patterns which can be identified. Firstly, for arson & threat, arson & \nblackmail and arson & kidnapping, there seems to be more danger of a \nreconviction if the two offences are convicted on separate occasions \u2013 Iin \nother words, when they are co-convictions, there is no evidence of any \nsubsequent homicides. In contrast, for threat & kidnapping and blackmail & \nkidnapping, there is no such relationship \u2013 indeed, co-convictions for threats & \nkidnapping seem to be a particular concern, and so endorsing the worry about \nthe behaviour of kidnappers after release (see Liu et al. in press). Finally, as \nmentioned earlier, the combination of threat & blackmail does not produce any \nsubsequent homicides. \n \nWith three or more serious offences involved, the combinations are \nvarious but, as already noted, the remarkable feature is that there are no \nsubsequent convictions for homicide recorded among this motley group. \n 18\n Probing risk factors for homicide \nTables 2 and 3 have described the observed rate of subsequent \nconviction of homicide following various combinations of arson, threats to kill, \nblackmail, and kidnapping. It suggested that those offenders who were \nspecialised in their serious crime behaviour, involving only one type of crime \nof interest, have a lower risk of being subsequently convicted of homicide than \nthose who involving two or more types of serious crime. However, in this \nessentially descriptive analysis, there was no attempt to control for follow-up \ntime or time at risk. \n \nWe now need to proceed more formally  in controlling for these effects, \nand in doing so, to assess the evidence of difference in risk of subsequent \nhomicide convictions between those offenders who were convicted of only \none of our focus offences and whose who had mixed types of convictions. We \nalso wish to explore if any types of sequencing are related to a higher risk of \nsubsequent homicide conviction. We use the Cox proportional hazards model \nto look for risk factors for a subsequent homicide conviction following one or \nmore serious crimes of interest. \n \nBy doing so, we will also be able to control for other important risk \nfactors such as gender, age at conviction, and previous convictions; it is \nrecognised that these three risk factors are important in the prediction of \nrecidivism.  \n \n 19\nThe sequencing of the serious focus crimes starts with the first focus \nconviction, and ending with the last focus conviction prior to homicide. We \ntake the last of these convictions and examine time from that conviction to \nhomicide, adjusting for periods spent in custody as described earlier in the \npaper.  \n \nTo summarize the sequencing of an offender\u2019s serious criminal \nhistory we take five measures which will be potential risk factors in the Cox \nanalysis.   \n a) The type of the first focus conviction in the sequence (i.e. arson, \nblackmail, kidnapping, threats to kill or a mix of more than one of these \noffences). \nb) The type of the last conviction in the sequence. \nc) The number of different types of focus offences involved in the \nsequence. This measures the diversity of serious offending. \nd) The number of focus offences, giving a measure of serious offence \nfrequency. \ne) The length of the sequence; that is, the time between the first and last \nfocus offence in the sequence. \nWe have also used gender of offender, number of previous convictions and \nage at the last focus conviction as general criminological risk factors. We \nlogged the number of previous convictions as previous work has shown that \nthis is a better predictor than the unlogged covariate.  \n \n 20\nWe fitted a series of Cox proportional hazard models, selecting a final \nmodel by examining the AIC (Lindsey and Jones, 1998) for each model, \nremoving insignificant risk factors. The final model with the lowest AIC \nincluded age, gender, logged previous convictions, the type of the first serious \noffence, and the number of different types of serious offence. All other \npotential risk factors were not significant. \n \n The Cox analysis models the underlying hazard rate (rather than \nsurvival time), and the results are shown in Table 4. As we expected, males \nare more at risk of a homicide conviction than females (p<0.042), with the risk \ndoubling compared to females. Also as expected, the risk of homicide \ndeclines with age (p<0.001), with around a 5% decline in risk for each year of \nage and increases with the number of prior convictions (p<0.001).  \n \n(Table 4 around here) \n \nTurning our attention to the risk factors summarising the sequencing \nof the four focus offences, we found that two of our five measures were \nimportant. Firstly, the type of the first serious offence is a significant risk factor \nfor subsequent homicide. An offender who began their serious offending with \nkidnapping has about 48% higher risk of homicide compared with one who \nstarted with arson; similarly an offender who began with threats to kill has \naround 55% higher risk over the arson offender. Other types of starting \noffence shows no significant difference from arson. This is consistent with the \nresults shown in Table 3. Offenders who start their criminal career with \n 21\nkidnapping then followed by arson (K\/A) had a high rate of subsequent \nhomicides (5.41%). Similarly, the offence of threats to kill followed by arson \nhas a similarly high homicide rate (3.45%).  \n \nSecondly, the number of distinct types of serious offences was also a \nsignificant risk factor, with increasing homicide risk as the number of types \nincreases. Thus, the offender who had two types of serious offence has nearly \ndouble (1.82) the risk of subsequent homicide conviction compared with an \noffender with only a single type of serious offence. This is also consistent with \nTable 2. \n \nThe specialist\/generalist debate among serious offenders \n Earlier we suggested that has been little consideration of the \nspecialist\/generalist debate in relation to serious offences. In brief, do \noffenders who continue with serious crime specialise in certain types of \nserious offending or is their criminal behaviour more versatile? Our view of \nspecialisation in this study is somewhat different to other specialisation \nstudies- here we are concerned solely about \u201cserious offence\u201d specialisation \nwithin the four focus offences. Thus, someone with two arson convictions but \nno convictions for blackmail, threats to kill or kidnap would be deemed a \nspecialist whether or not they had additional convictions for theft, criminal \ndamage etc.   \n \nTable 5 shows that, during the full observation period, the vast majority of the \ntotal series are convicted of just one of the four focus offences under \n 22\nconsideration.  However, now considering all the persons who have been \nconvicted on at least two occasions of one or more of these serious offences \nproduces some further clues in relation to the specialist\/generalist debate.  \n \n(Table 5 around here) \n \n Table 5 shows that there is a range on the specialist\/generalist \ncontinuum. Those convicted of arson are the most likely to specialise \u2013 they \nare four times more likely to be only convicted of arson subsequently than \nbeing convicted of one of the other serious offences being considered (3664 \npersons compared to 866 in Table 5). In contrast, the other three offences are \nin the opposite direction. Those first convicted of kidnapping are over four \ntimes more likely to be considered as a generalist than a specialist (979 are \nnot specialised, while only 216 are). Similarly, those convicted of blackmail or \nthreats to kill are around two and a half times more likely to be considered to \nbe generalists rather than specialists. These findings have important \nimplications for considering serious offending. \n \n \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \n This article has been an attempt to open up a discussion about the \ninter-relationships between serious types of crime, for we maintain that this \nfeature of criminal careers has been neglected in the criminological literature. \nThe results should, hopefully, encourage more to think about this topic.  \n 23\nHowever, a further analysis is perhaps unlikely to challenge the following \npoints: \n \n\u2022 There is evidence that those convicted of one of the four focus \noffences often specialise in the types of serious offences for which they \nget convicted.  . However, they vary in this respect with those convicted \nof arson the most likely to specialise. Evidence of specialisation is \ncontrary to low-tariff high-volume offenders. \n\u2022 Those convicted of arson, blackmail, and threats to kill all have very \nsimilar proportions in terms of subsequent convictions for homicide \n(0.8%) in a 20-year period at risk \u2013 that is, around 1 in 160. However, \nkidnapping offenders seem to be more dangerous in this respect with a \nhigher proportion (1.0%) \u2013 around 1 in 100 - being subsequently \nconvicted of homicide. This compares with the likelihood of around 1 in \n3,000 male members of the general population being convicted for \nhomicide over a 20-year follow-up period (Francis and Soothill, 2000).  \n\u2022 The speed of reconviction for homicide varies for these four offences.  \nIn particular, kidnapping shows the most rapid gradient with a \nheightened risk of homicide in the early years after conviction.  In \ncontrast, arson offenders have a fairly constant rate over the 20-year \nperiod. \n\u2022 The effect of having two or more convictions for one or more of the four \noffences is complex. However, the effect becomes clearer when \nincorporated into a statistical analysis of risk factors for homicide.  In \nbrief, while sequencing is interesting, the nature of the first serious \n 24\noffence and the number of the distinct types of serious offences are the \ntwo significant risk factors (as well as age, gender and the number of \nprevious convictions).  \n \nThe results are clear but what of the theoretical implications?  In truth, \nthe material in this paper tells nothing of the underlying motivations of the \nperpetrators and we can make no compelling case for any particular \ntheoretical approach.  However, there are still some signposts that are \nevident.  First, though, one needs some caveats and warning notices.  While \napproaching nine out of ten persons in the study were only convicted once for \none of these serious offences, there could be convictions for other serious \noffences we have not considered; also this group could range from those \nbeing convicted of just this one offence to those whose serious offence \nresides among a vast range of lesser crime.  Nevertheless, we can say with \nsome confidence that nine of out ten are neither candidates for specialisation \nin the narrow sense4 nor for overlap in terms of the four offences.  Whatever \nexplanation one might have for the remaining ten per cent or so, the majority \nconvicted of just one focus offence seem different in their involvement in \nserious crime in terms of it seemingly being much more transient. \n \nThe remaining ten per cent also have their differences beyond that of \ncommitting different kinds of offences.  We have divided the total series into \nthose we have termed as \u2018specialist\u2019 and those we have termed as \u2018not \nspecialised\u2019.  Again, each of these two sub-groups can be involved in other \ntypes of crime (or not).  Nevertheless, we feel we can make some \n 25\nobservations relating to the specialist\/generalist debate and to the issue of \nsequencing\/switching  As Piquero et al. (2003: 457) note, these two issues \nare directly related..   \n \nThe specialist\/generalist debate has been plagued by the notion that \nthis needs to be a simple dichotomy, while we have argued that the \ninterpretation is more complex and relates to the level of analysis being \nundertaken.  In brief, an offender can be both a specialist and a generalist \n(Soothill et al., 2000).  So, an offender can display a vast range of offending \nbehaviour but, when he is involved in sexual offending, he may only engage, \nfor example, in supposedly consensual sex with a girl under 16 years \u2013 the \nformer vast range of offending behaviour may classify him as a generalist \nwhile the latter as a specialist within the realm of sexual offending.   \nSomething similar may be happening in this analysis. \n \nWhen arson is the first serious offence, then arson is four times more \nlikely to be the second serious offence rather than one of the other three \noffences considered in this study.  For the other three offences, there is not \nthe same relationship.  Indeed, for these offenders it is more than twice as \nlikely to be one of the other three offences.  In short, even though we are not \ninvestigating the full repertoire of offending for each offender in this study, it \nstill seems valid to speak of arson recidivists are being more likely to be \nspecialised at a serious crime level than the members of the other three \ngroups. \n \n 26\nWe have also probed sequencing or switching. Apart from \nspecialisation, the criminal justice system is also interested in whether \noffenders are likely to desist and, if not, whether they are likely to switch their \noffending focus.  Elsewhere we made a modest attempt to consider offending \npathways in terms of showing what offenders are doing in one five-year period \ncompared to the following five-year period (Francis et al., 2004). However, as \nArmstrong and Britt (2004: 843) stress, \u201cVirtually all research on patterns of \noffense types across the criminal career has focused on establishing whether \noffenders tend to commit the same or more serious types of offenses over \ntime.\u201d  Indeed, Armstrong and Britt\u2019s own work continues this tradition by \nfocusing on specialisation and escalation.  Hence, the focus on switching or \nsequencing has been somewhat limited.  There seems, for example, to have \nbeen little interest in whether offenders switch from one serious offence to \nanother. In this article we use the term \u2018sequencing\u2019 rather than \u2018switching\u2019 as \nthe former term seems to imply that a particular behaviour may still continue \nalthough the criminal repertoire may increase, while the latter term seems to \nimply a more complete change of focus. The present analysis suggests that a \nstudy of sequencing has some merit.  So, for example, being convicted of \narson and threats to kill on different occasions seems to present a greater \ndanger of subsequent homicide than being convicted of these two offences on \nthe same occasion.  Nevertheless, it is also useful to remind that another \ninterpretation is quite simply that two separate court appearances are a \ngreater danger than one court appearance.  However, this, in turn, can be \ncountered from the evidence in this study that threats to kill followed by an \narson conviction on another occasion seem to be a harbinger of greater \n 27\ndanger than the convictions for these two offences occurring in the reverse \norder.  In brief, the value of sequencing is not really proven in this study, but \nwe can endorse that there should be more interest in the topic. \n \nWhile reiterating the usual need for more research, we suggest that our \nstudy does provide a methodology and some results which chart the way \nforward for considering serious offences.  In probing the risk for homicide \n(which is, after all, a rigorous measure of future danger), it is clear that the \ntype of the first serious offence and the number of distinct types of serious \noffences are both serious risk factors for subsequent homicide.  This supports \nour wider belief that in studying and understanding criminal careers both the \nquality and the quantity of the offending is relevant. \n \nAcknowledgments \n Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the International \nSymposium on Forensic Sciences, February 2006, at the Amity University, \nUttar Pradesh, India. and at the American Society of Criminology conference \nin Los Angeles in November 2006.

Kidnapping was only coded as a separate offence in the Offenders Index in \n1979 \u2013 previously it was included in the \u2018Others\u2019 category. Hence, in theory, the kidnapping \ndataset could include persons who were convicted of kidnapping prior to 1979; however, we \nbelieve that this would involve few persons.  \n \n2 In theory, a person could, in fact, have a conviction for any of these offences prior to 1963 \nwhen the Offenders Index started. However, this could only happen with offenders aged 27 \nyears or more in 1979. For someone to have a conviction for one of the four serious offences \nand then have a gap of at least 16 years before being convicted of one of these four offences \nagain would be rare. \n \n3 The estimate of the time from conviction to release being around 30% of sentence awarded \nwas made as follows. 1995 Prison Statistics in England and Wales (Home Office, 1996) \ncontain an estimate that, for adult males, between 40% and 50% of sentence awarded is \nactually served (Table 4.14). However, this includes time spent on remand before conviction. \n48% of the prison population spent time on remand, with an average of around 60 days \nincreasing to around a year for some cases. (Chapter 2, ibid). This gave a reduction of \nbetween 10% and 15 % depending on sentence awarded, giving the final result of 30%. Data \nfor other years are similar and 1995 figures are representative of the period under study  \n \n4 The \u2018narrow sense\u2019 of specialisation means, for example, a conviction for arson followed by \nanother conviction for arson.  However, there is scope for similar behaviour being included in \nthe notion of specialisation \u2013 a conviction for criminal damage may, for example, be \nconsidered as similar behaviour to arson. \n 37\n"}
