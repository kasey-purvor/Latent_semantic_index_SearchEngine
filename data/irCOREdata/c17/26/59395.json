Introduction 19 \nOn May 12th 2009, the United States National Aeronautical and Space Adminstration (NASA) 20 \nissued a press release which began as follows: \u201cTwenty years ago NASA embarked on a 21 \nrevolutionary new mission for its Earth science program: to study our home planet from space as an 22 \ninter-related whole, rather than as individual parts.\u201d (NASA, 2009). Few would doubt the 23 \nrevolutionary impact of this \u201cmission\u201d, and of the concomitant allocation of the US national science 24 \nbudget to Earth Sciences. As NASA themselves went on to claim that their:  \u201c\u2026vision laid the 25 \ngroundwork for advances in global climate change and understanding natural and human-induced 26 \n 2 \nchanges in the land surface, atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and Earth's interior that affect all aspects 27 \nof life.\u201d 28 \n 29 \nThe emergence of Earth Systems Science is therefore closely linked with the development of space-30 \nborne sensors for monitoring the Earth System at global and regional scales. Since it is information 31 \nfrom the earth\u2019s surface which the satellite sensors receive, the role of geomorphology in Earth 32 \nSystems Science had the potential to be huge, both as the object of direct investigation, and as a 33 \nsurrogate for processes that operate in the zone where the biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and 34 \nlithosphere interact. Another key technical advance, which was to provide a crucial dataset showing 35 \nthe link between the biosphere and the atmosphere, was provided by Keeling\u2019s (1960) installation 36 \nof infra-red gas analysers at locations in Antarctica, Hawaii, and California. Prior to Keeling\u2019s 37 \nobservations, it was believed that fluctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide contained no 38 \nsystematic trend. By carefully isolating the influence of volcanic emissions and locally-emitted 39 \nCO2, Keeling (1960) revealed two key aspects of the coupled atmosphere-biosphere. The most 40 \ncelebrated finding was a secular increase in carbon dioxide concentrations which is attributed to a 41 \ncombination of fossil fuel combustion and changes in land-use (Keeling, 1960), and which has been 42 \nmonitored continually at many locations over the 50 years since. The second of Keeling\u2019s findings 43 \nconcerned the natural seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 concentration, in which higher rates of 44 \nplant photosynthesis during the boreal summer lead to a relative decrease in globally-averaged 45 \nconcentration of atmospheric CO2 during this period. Taken together, these findings were among 46 \nthe first to combine precise measurements of earth system properties, with the concept of 47 \nmeaningful interactions between the biosphere and the atmosphere. These links occur through 48 \nvariations in earth surface properties, placing geomorphology in a key position to contribute to the 49 \nwider debate. The aims of the present review are therefore to describe some of the contributions that 50 \nEarth System Science has made to geomorphology, to evaluate some of the contributions that 51 \n 3 \ngeomorphology has made to Earth System Science, and to suggest some key areas of Earth System 52 \nScience to which geomorphology can contribute in the future.  53 \n 54 \n2. What is Earth System Science? 55 \nThe first widely-cited use of the term Earth System Science is in a report written for NASA in 1988 56 \nby Francis Bretherton, entitled Earth System Science: A Closer View. This report set out a goal for 57 \nEarth System Science: \u201cto obtain a scientific understanding of the entire Earth system on a global 58 \nscale by describing how its component parts and their interactions have evolved, how they function, 59 \nand how they may be expected to continue to evolve on all timescales.\u201d (Bretherton, 1988, p. 11). 60 \nMoreover, the report recognizes a new challenge to: \u201cdevelop the capability to predict those 61 \nchanges that will occur in the next decade to century, both naturally and in response to human 62 \nactivity\u201d (p. 11). 63 \n 64 \nWhilst acknowledging that \u201cGlobal connections among the Earth\u2019s components began to be 65 \nrecognizes in the last [i.e., 19th] century\u201d (p.25), and pointing specifically to the contributions of 66 \nHutton, Lyell and Darwin, Bretherton\u2019s (1988) report passes only briefly over the intellectual 67 \nhistory of Earth Systems Science insofar as it is connected to (physical) geography. As Richards 68 \nand Clifford (2008) point out, it is: \u201cin NASA\u2019s interests to promulgate a totalizing view of ESS, 69 \nsince its mission is Earth Observation\u201d (p. 1325). Bretherton\u2019s proposed methodology is that: \u201cBy 70 \nexamining our present knowledge of [these] processes and phenomena we can identify what are 71 \nprobably the most significant interactions among them, quantify that understanding in terms of 72 \nexplicit models, and devise observations and experiments that test many of the important 73 \nconclusions.\u201d (p. 26). 74 \n 75 \nSince the publication of NASA\u2019s manifesto, several other groups have discussed the relevance of 76 \nEarth System Science and the integration of geomorphology within its remit (Church, 1998; NERC, 77 \n 4 \n2007). Paola et al. (2006) positioned their vision of a \u201cpredictive science of Earth surface 78 \ndynamics\u201d in the context of a series of integrating challenges (p.1), noting that pursuit of these aims 79 \nrequired collaboration between hydrologists, geomorphologists, ocean and atmospheric scientists, 80 \nsedimentary and structural geologists, geochemists, and ecologists. They call for: \u201c\u2026the scientific 81 \ncommunity to work together towards this grand goal [to develop] a unified surface process science 82 \nthat would integrate insight from all of the above fields to provide a comprehensive and predictive 83 \nunderstanding of the dynamics of our planet\u2019s surface\u201d (p.1). Whilst this viewpoint is grand, 84 \nintegrative, and inspirational, it finds a counterpoint in the notion that the general answers that 85 \nscience can provide are inextricably linked to the particular questions that different human societies 86 \nand communities wish to pose (see Richards and Clifford, 2008, for a closer look at the problem 87 \nthrough this lens).  The role of humans has always been central to Earth System Science: for 88 \nBretherton (1988), the activities of humans were supposed to be incorporated into predictions using 89 \n\u201cscenarios\u201d based on plausible trajectories of social behaviour. A clear example of the use of 90 \nscenarios to represent possible human behaviour is in the set of CO2 emission scenarios published 91 \nin the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios 92 \n(IPCC, 2001). Nevertheless, as Liverman and Roman-Cuesta (2008, p. 1458) explain: \u201cfor 93 \ninteractions between the social and earth to succeed, a certain level of tolerance and mutual 94 \nunderstanding will be needed so that the social scientists understand the earth science aspiration for 95 \nquantitative socioeconomic scenarios and predictions, and earth scientists understand the variation 96 \nin how social scientists explain human behaviour and institutions and accept the clear limits to 97 \npredicting human activities and decisions\u201d. 98 \n 99 \nThe approach of the present review will be first to quantify the growth of Earth System Science as a 100 \nmotivator of research grant funding and in publication trends. Second, I shall consider three sets of 101 \nkey geomorphological studies, which contribute to the aims of Earth System Science, and which 102 \n 5 \nthemselves are informed by a deeper understanding of the importance of interactions in the Earth 103 \nSystem. 104 \n 105 \n3. Research trends 106 \nFunding and publication trends can be assessed using publicly-available metrics, such as those 107 \nreleased by funding bodies and records of citations such as the Science Citation Index (SCI). 108 \nClearly, these sources are not infallible: much good research is done outside the auspices of 109 \nmainstream funding; and the Science Citation Index captures work published in a finite range of 110 \njournals, potentially missing many pieces of work published in other forms such as research reports 111 \nand books. Nevertheless, these sources of information provide a suitable indicator of research 112 \ntrends. For example, over the past eight years, funding from the UK Natural Environment Research 113 \nCouncil (NERC) for Earth System Science has increased from under \u00a31m to over \u00a36m (Figure 1). 114 \nIndeed, Earth System Science now features as a distinct \u2018theme\u2019 within NERC\u2019s funding strategy. 115 \nThis funding has been directed to a number of high-profile collaborative and interdisciplinary 116 \nprojects, including QUEST (Quantifying the Earth System), SOLAS (Surface Ocean Lower 117 \nAtmosphere Study), and IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Programme). Of course, it is possible that 118 \nincrease results from a recognition by applicants that Earth System Science is a promising field of 119 \nenquiry rather than through an organic evolution of interest in the topic. As Figure 2 illustrates, over 120 \nhalf of the money allocated to Earth System Science was spent in Geography and Earth Science 121 \ndepartments. A 20 percent share of the overall spend occurred in departments where these two 122 \ndisciplines had been amalgamated. A further 26 percent of the total was spent in \u2018traditional\u2019 123 \nscience departments (physics and maths, chemistry, biology), and the balance of 18 percent was 124 \nallocated to directly-funded Research Council facilities such as the British Antarctic Survey, British 125 \nGeological Survey, National Oceanography Centre, and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.  126 \n 127 \n 6 \nThe number of publications containing the term \u201cEarth System Science\u201d in the topic field has 128 \nincreased from under 50 in 1988 to over 400 in 2004 (Figure 3), although there is considerable 129 \ninter-annual variability (and a problematic hiatus in 2002\u20133). The top five disciplines contributing 130 \nto the growth in popularity of the term \u201cEarth System Science\u201d in the literature are: engineering, 131 \ngeology, physics, environmental sciences and ecology, and geochemistry and geophysics. 132 \nGeography (as a search term) ranks 21st in the list of Earth System Science disciplines, producing 133 \nless than two percent of the total publication output. Given the strong emphasis placed by 134 \ngeographers on interactions between human and physical components of the Earth System, there is 135 \na clear opportunity here. Of course, there is no separate record of publications from physical 136 \ngeography and much of the work produced by the latter sub-discipline will undoubtedly have been 137 \nrecorded in one of the other five preceding categories. 138 \n 139 \n4. Geomorphology in the Earth System 140 \nThe increase in research funding and publications relating to Earth System Science has led to a 141 \npartial re-orientation of research questions. Instead of pursuing finer and finer detail in simulations 142 \nof environmental systems, there is a recognition that coarser-scale models with reduced complexity 143 \ncan contribute to collective understanding of interactions between components of environmental 144 \nsystems. Richards and Clifford (2008) provide a stimulating philosophical and sociological 145 \ndiscussion of this trend; my aim here is to pick out several key strands of the debate using three 146 \nexamples of environmental systems in which geomorphology plays a key role: (i) the links between 147 \ntopography, global tectonics and atmospheric circulation; (ii) the link between geomorphic 148 \nprocesses and biogeochemical cycles; and (iii) links between biological processes and the earth\u2019s 149 \nsurface. 150 \n 151 \n4.1 Tectonic uplift and Cenozoic climate change 152 \n 7 \nThe role of earth-surface processes in interactions between the lithosphere, atmosphere and 153 \nhydrosphere has received renewed interest on a global scale over the past twenty years. Erosion 154 \ncontrols the topographic evolution of active mountain belts (Koons, 1989; Beaumont et al., 1992; 155 \nWillett, 1999) and is the main source of sediment delivered to the sea (Milliman and Syvitski, 156 \n1992). Climate-driven erosion removes surface material, which modifies the topographic expression 157 \nof tectonic processes and alters the state of stress in the lithosphere (Molnar and England, 1990; 158 \nWillett, 1999). In turn, construction of mountain belts modifies global and regional atmospheric 159 \ncirculation patterns and composition (Kutzbach et al., 1989) because atmospheric carbon dioxide is 160 \nconsumed by rapid weathering of fresh silicate crust exposed in active orogens (Raymo et al., 161 \n1992), and particulate organic carbon is buried in nearby sedimentary basins (Lyons et al., 2002; 162 \nHilton et al., 2008).  163 \n 164 \nIn the context of Earth System Science, which is concerned with interactions between processes 165 \nacross different time- and space-scales, erosion provides a two-way link between tectonics and 166 \nclimate. This link is especially effective in active, compressional orogens which deliver most clastic 167 \nsediment and a significant component of the chemical and organic discharges to the ocean, and it is 168 \nto these settings that much attention has been directed (Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Gaillardet et 169 \nal., 1999). The links between erosion, climate, and tectonics vary across time-scales, from enhanced 170 \nerosion associated with individual earthquakes, to feedbacks between orographic precipitation and 171 \nthe growth of mountain topography. Thus observations of erosion rates across multiple time-scales 172 \nprovide essential information on the links between climate, tectonics, and topography. Mountain 173 \nerosion rates have been successfully quantified in localized areas (e.g., Burbank et al., 1996; 174 \nBurbank et al., 2003; Dadson et al., 2003; Reiners et al., 2003; Wobus et al., 2003), and attempts 175 \nhave been made to predict long-term erosion rates from present-day relief and precipitation (e.g., 176 \nFinlayson et al., 2002). 177 \n 178 \n 8 \nThe feedbacks between focused climate-driven erosion and the tectonic evolution of entire 179 \nmountain belts are most clearly shown in geodynamic models of orogenic evolution. These models 180 \nrange in complexity from simple analytical models of critical wedge topography (Davis et al., 1983) 181 \nto more complicated numerical simulations of the links between tectonic and erosional processes 182 \n(Willett, 1999). Critical wedge models treat the crust as a plastic frictional material in front of a 183 \nmoving backstop. The material deforms so that it attains the minimum taper angle at which it can 184 \nslide on its base. The slope of the wedge reflects a balance between gravitational stresses arising 185 \nfrom the surface topography and basal shear stresses resulting from stronger material underthrust 186 \nbeneath. The wedge grows by continued accretion, whilst its shape remains the same. The balance 187 \nbetween the tectonic mass flux and erosional mass flux determines the rate of orogen growth. If 188 \ntectonic input and erosional output are equal, the orogen is in a flux steady state and its size and 189 \ndeformation fronts will not change (Willett and Brandon, 2002). If the tectonic input exceeds 190 \nerosional output, the orogen will grow through outward propagation of its deformation fronts. If the 191 \nerosional output exceeds the tectonic input, the zone of active deformation will reduce in size, and 192 \nprevious deformation fronts will become inactive. It is important to note that spatial variations in 193 \nerosion rate will lead to locally varying deformation and rock uplift. If erosion is focused in areas of 194 \nhigh precipitation, the crustal deformation field will adjust to maintain the critical taper. This 195 \nmechanism can produce local zones in mountain belts through which rock mass is advected and 196 \neroded (Willett, 1999; Beaumont et al., 2001). 197 \n 198 \nWillett (1999) investigated the coupled system of uplift and erosion using a finite element, plane 199 \nstrain model of deformation with a stream power erosion model of bedrock incision. The numerical 200 \nmodel showed that if erosion rates are low, crustal thickening continues until the lower crust is 201 \nsufficiently warm that it flows laterally. This flow prevents further thickening, promotes outward 202 \npropagation of the deformation fronts, and leads to the formation of a high elevation plateau. An 203 \nexample of such a plateau is the Altiplano in the central Andes, the location of which coincides with 204 \n 9 \nlow precipitation rates (and therefore presumably low erosion rates; Willett, 1999; Montgomery et 205 \nal., 2001). Willett (1999) showed that adding erosion to his model led the topography to attain a 206 \nsteady-state in which elevation was constant over time. Fundamental results of this model included 207 \nasymmetric topography with shallower slopes facing the subducting plate, and an asymmetric 208 \npattern of exhumation with the deepest levels opposite to subduction (Figure 5). In subsequent 209 \nnumerical simulations, Willett (1999) added asymmetrically-varying precipitation across the 210 \nmountain belt, to represent orographically-enhanced precipitation in response to a dominant 211 \nregional wind direction. This addition modified the first-order orogenic features. With the dominant 212 \nwind and moisture flux in the direction of subduction, a broad zone of exhumation was predicted, 213 \nwith maximum exhumation in the orogen interior. This case is similar to the situation in the 214 \nOlympic Mountains of Washington State, USA, where metamorphic index minerals and fission-215 \ntrack thermochronometry have shown a broad, bull\u2019s-eye pattern of exhumation, which is deepest in 216 \nthe area well behind the leading edge. In the contrasting case, with a dominant wind in the opposite 217 \ndirection to subduction, the model predicted a focused zone of exhumation at the margin of the 218 \norogen. 219 \n 220 \nThe results from coupled geomorphic and geodynamic models suggest that climate-driven erosion 221 \nis of first-order geophysical significance in the evolution of mountain belts across a range of time-222 \nscales. However, the recent advances in modelling have outpaced the analysis of relevant field 223 \nobservations, with the result that most models are underconstrained. The links between erosion, 224 \ntectonics, and climate are complex and understanding them requires detailed quantitative 225 \nobservations of erosion, and better constraints on the rates of climatic and tectonic process that 226 \ndrive erosion across a range of time-scales. Important questions that must be addressed are: what 227 \nprocesses drive, and limit, the rate at which crustal material is removed from mountain belts?  Do 228 \nerosion rates inferred from topography match measured erosion rates? Are the dominant processes 229 \nthat drive erosion consistent across time-scales ranging from decades to millions of years? How do 230 \n 10 \nclimate-driven erosional and tectonic processes interact to create topography on the scales of 231 \nindividual faults and entire landscapes? Many of these questions have been investigated using 232 \nsurface process models, but real world patterns are not well known and further progress requires 233 \nquantitative observations of mountain erosion across a range of time-scales. 234 \n 235 \nA controversial feedback was proposed by Molnar and England (1990), who claimed that in the late 236 \nTertiary and Quaternary the global shift to a cooler and more erosive climate has enhanced 237 \ntopographic relief in mountain ranges. They argued that the isostatic response to increased erosion 238 \nof valley floors would raise mountain peaks higher. Moreover, higher peaks would accumulate 239 \nmore snow, which would promote rapid glacial weathering and erosion. In turn, rapid silicate 240 \nweathering and erosion would withdraw atmospheric carbon dioxide and lead to further reductions 241 \nin global temperature. 242 \n 243 \nThe feedback proposed by Molnar and England (1990) has provoked much debate; it rests on the 244 \nassumption that the transition to a more erosive climate enhances mountain relief (Small, 1999; 245 \nWhipple et al., 1999). In fact the opposite may be true, although in 1990 when Molnar and England 246 \nwere writing only statistical studies had demonstrated that higher erosion rates were correlated with 247 \nreduced relief (Melton, 1957). Topographic relief at the scale of a mountain range consists of 248 \nhillslope and fluvial components. River incision can increase relief only if hillslopes can 249 \nsimultaneously become steeper. This is possible only if hillslopes are shallower than their angle of 250 \nrepose (van Burkelow, 1945). To investigate typical hillslope angles in rapidly-uplifting mountain 251 \nbelts, Schmidt and Montgomery (1995) analysed slope profiles in the Washington Cascade Range, 252 \nand the Santa Cruz Mountains of central California, USA. These areas have both exhibited 253 \nwidespread bedrock landsliding. Schmidt and Montgomery (1995) compared observed slope angles 254 \nwith predictions from a model of hillslope stability based on a Coulomb-type failure criterion and 255 \nconcluded that natural slopes do not become steeper than the angle of internal friction of the 256 \n 11 \nmaterial from which they are made. Accordingly, they proposed that mountain-scale material 257 \nstrength places a limit on the topographic relief that can develop as a result of river incision. 258 \n 259 \nBurbank et al. (1996) observed a similar situation to Schmidt and Montgomery (1995) in the north-260 \nwestern Himalayas, near Nanga Parbat. Burbank et al. (1996) showed that, despite very rapid 261 \nerosion (2\u201312 mm yr-1), average and modal hillslope angles are independent of erosion rate. They 262 \nsuggested that slope angles are controlled by a common threshold process, which is dictated by the 263 \nmaterial properties. Mean relief is set not by erosion rate but by the spacing of large rivers. Burbank 264 \net al. (1996) proposed that a balance is maintained between bedrock uplift and river incision: 265 \nlandslides allow hillslopes to adjust efficiently to rapid river downcutting. Moreover, the findings of 266 \nBurbank and coworkers (1996) imply that the greatest relief develops either where rocks are less 267 \nfractured (Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995), or where drainage density is lowest (Melton, 1957). 268 \n 269 \nThe studies by Schmidt and Montgomery (1995) and Burbank et al. (1996) demonstrate that in 270 \nmany tectonically active mountain ranges, hillslopes fail by bedrock landsliding to keep pace with 271 \nbedrock river incision. This finding is important in understanding the relation between climate, 272 \nvalley incision and the uplift of mountain peaks, because it challenges the assumption of Molnar 273 \nand England (1990) that relief can be increased by the incision of deep valleys. If hillslopes are 274 \ntypically at their angle of repose, then changes in mountain relief can occur only through incision of 275 \nmountain rivers into bedrock, and rates of river profile evolution will dictate the link between 276 \nerosion and mountain scale relief. 277 \n 278 \nTaken together, results from geomorphological modelling studies show that the links between 279 \nerosion, tectonics, and climate are complex. Much of the argument has been driven by modelling, 280 \nyet models are heavily parametrized and poorly constrained. Understanding natural patterns of 281 \nerosion requires more detailed, quantitative observations of erosion. Important questions that must 282 \n 12 \nbe addressed are: what are the relative roles of extreme and moderate floods in driving erosion rates 283 \nin tectonically active landscapes? Over what time-scales does climatic variability matter? Can 284 \nerosion rates be inferred from topography, and what is the role of substrate strength in determining 285 \nthe expression of climatic and tectonic processes in topography? To answer these questions requires 286 \nobservations of average erosion rates and their variability over a range of time-scales. 287 \n 288 \nThe work described so far clearly shows the importance of interactions in the Earth System. Recent 289 \nadvances in our collective understanding of these interactions have involved simplifications of 290 \nseveral sets of dynamical processes that would be treated in a very different ways if they were the 291 \nsole focus of study (e.g., processes in fluvial geomorphology are increasingly treated using 292 \napproaches based on computational fluid dynamics (see Bates et al., 2005, for some examples); 293 \ndetailed modelling of strain rates in the continental lithosphere would adopt a similarly involved 294 \nprocedure (see Jackson and McKenzie, 1988; Hu et al., 2001 for two contrasting approaches). The 295 \nchallenge presented by the papers described above (e.g., Willett, 1999) is to integrate these 296 \nprocesses at the appropriate time and space scales, with appropriate levels of conceptual 297 \nsimplification. This is the central goal of Earth System Science. It is, of course, a goal familiar to 298 \nphysical geographers, and this aim will no doubt strike a resonant note among geomorphologists 299 \nfamiliar with the analysis of Schumm and Lichty (1965), which demonstrates how processes can be 300 \nconceptualised at different scales.  301 \n 302 \n4.2 Geomorphology and biogeochemical cycles 303 \nRapid changes over the past decade have seen the role of earth-surface processes as drivers of 304 \nchanges to biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle. For example, rates of soil erosion are 305 \nsensitive to changes in surface runoff. Soils store a significant amount of carbon: globally, the 306 \nequivalent of approximately 200\u2013300 times the amount of carbon released annually through the 307 \nburning of fossil fuels (Cox et al., 2000). Any enhancement of soil erosion caused by changing 308 \n 13 \nrunoff can be expected to make a major contribution to carbon cycle feedbacks in a changing 309 \nclimate. Indeed, preliminary estimates of large-scale soil carbon fluxes suggest that an important 310 \ncomponent of this feedback may be attributable to the effects of soil movement by geomorphic 311 \nprocesses (Stallard, 1998). Nevertheless, the role of soil erosion and redistribution in the carbon 312 \ncycle remains an area of some controversy with estimates of the global carbon flux associated with 313 \nerosion ranging from a 1 Gt year-1 source to a 1 Gt year-1 sink (Stallard, 1998; Lal, 2003). The 314 \nmagnitude of carbon redistribution by sediment erosion and deposition demonstrates the potential 315 \nfor geomorphic processes to make a major contribution to the global carbon budget. For example, 316 \nJacinthe and Lal (2001) estimate that 5.7 Pg C yr-1 are mobilised by water erosion. Soil erosion 317 \nexposes fresh material at the surface which results in a disequilibrium between soil carbon content 318 \nand crop carbon input that maintains a continuous supply of carbon for transfer to sedimentary 319 \nenvironments. Stallard (1998) has hypothesized that this conveyor of sediment-associated carbon 320 \nfrom hillslope to sedimentary environments has the potential to sequester atmospheric CO2 at the 321 \nrate of 1\u20132 Gt C yr-1 globally. 322 \n 323 \nThere is a clear research need to quantify the effects on the carbon cycle of soil erosion and 324 \ndeposition, however, approaches capable of doing this at appropriate scales have yet to be 325 \ndeveloped. A number of recent quantitative studies stand out in this respect. Lyons et al. (2002) 326 \nshowed that over one third of the total particulate organic carbon flux from the land surface to the 327 \nocean derived from sediment-laden rivers draining the mountainous western Pacific region. 328 \nMoreover, in a detailed study of the role of storm flows in triggering carbon delivery, Hilton et al. 329 \n(2008) have shown that, in the mountainous Li Wu River in Taiwan, between 77 and 92 percent of 330 \nmodern particulate organic flux was transported during large, cyclone-induced floods. The impact 331 \nof land-management practices is also of potential importance. Indeed, recent hillslope-scale 332 \nmodelling has shown that within-field soil redistribution, principally driven by tillage, has been 333 \nresponsible for a net sink in the order of 5\u201310 g C m-2 year-1 over the last half century at two sites in 334 \n 14 \nNW Europe (Van Oost et al., 2005). Quantification of feedbacks between the geomorphic system 335 \nand the carbon cycle offer a clear example of a critically-important scientific activity that is likely to 336 \nbenefit from a funding framework influenced by Earth System Science 337 \n 338 \nAnother biogeochemically-active constituent of the geomorphic system is found in mineral dust 339 \naerosols. As one of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols, mineral dust plays a key role in 340 \ndetermining the planetary radiation budget. Whilst this effect may be to increase the amount of 341 \nshort-wave radiation reflected back into space (leading to a cooling effect), the presence of mineral 342 \naerosols may also lead to increased absorption of outgoing long-wave radiation (having a warming 343 \neffect similar to that of greenhouse gases). The balance between the two is governed by the vertical 344 \nprofile of dust concentration (Washington et al., 2008). 345 \n 346 \nDust aerosols also provide iron and other nutrients to marine phytoplankton populations and 347 \nterrestrial vegetation during deposition.  Dust emissions occur in response to aeolian deflation, and 348 \nare controlled mainly by variability in vegetation, soil moisture, and surface erodibility. Dry low-349 \nlying regions such as dry lake beds  are the main source of African dust events (Ginoux et al, 2001; 350 \nProspero et al, 2002; Washington et al., 2009). Consequently there are clearly potential feedbacks 351 \ninvolving dust associated with a changing climate. It is hypothesised that during glacial-interglacial 352 \ncycles, increases in the dust supply of iron to the ocean resulted in a significant Earth system 353 \nfeedback, driving about one third of the observed glacial-interglacial variations in atmospheric CO2 354 \n(Kohfeld et al., 2005). Some early studies (e.g., Tegen & Fung, 1995) have found that, in the 355 \nmodern setting, human influences have increased dust emissions directly via changes in land use by 356 \nas much as 20\u201350 percent (Tegen et al, 1996; Sokolik & Toon, 1996). However, more recent 357 \nestimates have revised the anthropogenic increase to be less than 10 percent (e.g., Tegen et al., 358 \n2004; Prospero et al., 2002). Further work is clearly required to quantify the potential effect of a 359 \n 15 \nfuture climate change scenario on dust emission, transport, and deposition, through to their effect on 360 \nthe ocean carbon cycle. 361 \n 362 \nGeomorphology and the biosphere 363 \nThe role of vegetation in geomorphic processes has been the subject of research ever since 364 \nDarwin\u2019s study of the effect of earthworms on reworking of soil organic matter (see Kennedy, 365 \n2006, for a review). Nevertheless, one of the stated aims of Earth System Science is to examine 366 \nlinkages between the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere. Before the explicit 367 \nemergence of the Earth System Science paradigm, the work of Langbein and Schumm (1958) was 368 \ninfluential in demonstrating the links between climate, vegetation, and erosion. These authors 369 \nshowed that rather than scaling simply with precipitation rate, erosion rates were highest in semi-370 \narid climates (rather than arid or humid climates), because in these regions, there was sufficient 371 \nprecipitation for erosion to occur, but insufficient to ensure perennial vegetation cover. More recent 372 \nreviews by Viles (1988), Naylor et al. (2002) and Stallins et al. (2006) have summarised the many 373 \ndevelopments in the field of biogeomorphology to date. 374 \n 375 \nWhilst the role of biota in governing geomorphic process rates has been recognized, Dietrich and 376 \nPerron (2006), recently turned the question around, asking: \u201cis there a topographic signature of 377 \nlife?\u201d That is, would a unique set of topographic properties be evident in a map from which all 378 \nvegetation and artefacts of human activity had been removed. The motivation for this question 379 \nillustrates the role that Earth System Science can play in setting the range of appropriate questions. 380 \nAlthough not stated explicitly, Dietrich and Perron\u2019s (2006) paper clearly addresses a key aim of 381 \nEarth System Science. The basis of Bretherton\u2019s original manifesto was that NASA should embark 382 \non a mission to Planet Earth. Clearly, if it is possible to detect life topographically (i.e., by 383 \nmeasuring nothing more than the elevations of points on a planet), then exploration for extra-384 \nterrestrial life is immediately made much easier. 385 \n 16 \n 386 \nDietrich and Perron (2006) structure their analysis to consider three distinct, but connected, 387 \nquestions: (i) what is the influence of biotic processes on weathering, erosion, and sediment 388 \ntransport mechanisms; (ii) how do biotic processes affect climatic and tectonic processes globally; 389 \nand (iii) what are the implications of biogeomorphic processes for the development of topography 390 \nin abiotic environments. In addressing the first question, it is clear that biological processes can 391 \nexert a strong control on the rates and styles of geomorphic processes such as soil production and 392 \ncreep (through animal burrowing, tree throw and root growth), landsliding (through enhanced root 393 \ncohesion and provision of surface cover), debris flows and river incision (via presence of large 394 \nwoody debris in channels). As Dietrich and Perron (2006) note, a key challenge is to develop 395 \ngeomorphic transport laws which represent these processes in ways that can be justified with 396 \nreference to high-quality field data. Nevertheless, even with a preliminary understanding of such 397 \nprocesses, model experiments are already providing qualitative explorations of the effects of biotic 398 \nprocesses on landforms (see Kirkby, 1995 and Collins et al., 2004). Indeed, Istanbulluoglu and Bras 399 \n(2005) have demonstrated numerically that changes in vegetation cover can lead to a transition from 400 \nrunoff-dominated erosion to landslide-dominated erosion (Figure 6) 401 \n 402 \nIn a thought experiment, Dietrich and Perron (2006) also consider what climate and tectonics would 403 \nlook like without the presence of life. They note that an obvious consequence of the removal of 404 \nbiotic influence would be a \u201crapid erosion of the soil mantle that covers semi-arid to wet 405 \nlandscapes\u201d (p. 413), but they go further to state that it is not correct to suppose that the presence of 406 \n\u201csmooth, rounded, soil-mantled hillslopes are a topographic signature of a biotic world\u201d (p.413). 407 \nThey key point here is that whilst biotic processes interact strongly with the lithosphere through 408 \ngeomorphic processes, the link does not result in a unique topographic form. There is an element of 409 \nequifinality in the system under study, in the sense that the same set of physical features can be 410 \ncreated by a range of different processes and that it is not possible to attribute a particular cause to 411 \n 17 \ntheir creation (see Schumm, 1991 for further discussion). The answer that Dietrich and Perron 412 \narrive at is illuminating, not only because it reveals how the earth\u2019s surface is a critical site for 413 \ninteractions in the earth system, but also because their analysis demonstrates how Earth System 414 \nScience can itself benefit from an understanding of some of the older concepts that have emerged in 415 \nearlier studies of complex systems in physical geography (such as equifinality, emergence, 416 \ninteractions of processes across a range of time- and space-scales; see Schumm, 1991, for a detailed 417 \nreview). 418 \n 419 \n6. Geomorphology in ESS: revolution, evolution or recapitulation 420 \nThe conclusions to the previous section raise several key questions for the future of geomorphology 421 \nin Earth System Science. According to Paola et al.\u2019s (2006) analysis, the greatest need is for better 422 \ncollaboration between the many disciplines that pertain to geomorphology. This integration can 423 \nhappen only when opportunities are sought for geoscientists to exchange ideas with colleagues from 424 \nother disciplines. In practice, this can actually be quite challenging: one is forced out of one\u2019s 425 \ncomfort zone. Yet numerous biographical accounts of major interdisciplinary scientific 426 \nachievements reveal the range of strategies that may be employed (see, for example, the accounts 427 \nby Peter Molnar and Dan McKenzie, in Oreskes, 2003). There may well be some technical 428 \nsolutions: better training in advanced mathematics is an obvious way to equip geoscientists with a 429 \nlingua franca with which to communicate with a wider range of other scientists. Better mathematics 430 \nshould also mean smarter mathematics: not just fiddling about with a complicated computer 431 \nsimulation until it produces results that look a bit like the real world (see Molnar, in Oreskes, 2003, 432 \nfor a more florid description of the drawbacks of such an approach), but understanding how to make 433 \nappropriate simplifications to a model of, say, river channel dynamics so that it may communicate 434 \nwith a model of, say, ecological succession or climate change. Beyond the technical challenge of 435 \nenabling communication between geoscientists of different backgrounds is the need to include 436 \nsocial science in Earth System Science. Here, Liverman and Roman-Cuesta (2008, p.1459) note the 437 \n 18 \nconsiderable barriers: \u201cAt worse, earth scientists sometimes assume that the role of the social 438 \nsciences is little more than that of a public relations effort to translate science to stakeholders. In 439 \nother cases earth scientists believe that the qualitative nature of some social science research sets 440 \ninsurmountable barriers to integrated analysis or modelling\u201d. Insofar as geographers possess skills 441 \nand interests that can bridge the potential barriers between natural and social science, they are well 442 \nplaced to advance the debate. The challenge in the coming years will be for University departments, 443 \nresearch institutes, funding bodies, and learned societies to provide suitable training and research, 444 \nfunding, and networking opportunities in order for this potential to be realised. 445 \n 446 \nAside from these practical needs, some more conceptual issues are raised by the rise of Earth 447 \nSystem Science. Whilst it should of course be clear that it is possible to pursue rigorous and 448 \nmeaningful research in geomorphology without involving or appealing to the imperatives of Earth 449 \nSystem Science; and, conversely, it is possible to understand major parts of the Earth System 450 \nwithout developing anything more than a cursory concept of geomorphology. However, where there 451 \nis a meaningful interface between geomorphology and other components of the Earth System (and I 452 \nhope to have introduced a wide-ranging set of examples of such circumstances), three key questions 453 \narise: (i) explanation and scientific method for earth systems science; (ii) questions of time and 454 \nspace scales and links between process operating at different scales; and (iii) the status of humans as 455 \nactors\/agents in a framework defined by Earth Systems Science. These are not trivial questions, and 456 \nthey cannot be approached as afterthoughts. They will require changes to the curriculum; they will 457 \nrequire changes to funding frameworks. But the rewards that come with an integrated understanding 458 \nof the earth system can be great: from more robust models of the effects of climate and land-use 459 \nchange on geomorphic processes, to a greater understanding of interactions of physics, chemistry 460 \nand biology. Physical geographers have a significant contribution to make, not just to the 461 \nintegration of knowledge of the biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere; but to the 462 \n 19 \ndetailed and nuanced ways in which the actions of and impacts upon human societies can be 463 \nenumerated, quantified, and communicated.  464 \n 465 \nReferences 466 \nBates, P.D., Lane, S.N. & Ferguson, R.I.

The 629 \napplied velocity is zero to the right of the grey block. Coulomb friction angle is 15 degrees. Below 630 \nthe Coulomb yield stress, crust deforms according to a temperature-dependent viscous constitutive 631 \nrelation. Time is nondimensionalized by (subduction velocity \/ crustal thickness) to give t*. The 632 \nArgand number is initially 0.5 at the base of the crustal layer. Shading indicates the instantaneous 633 \n 30 \nnondimensional strain rate. The pro-wedge moves in the direction of subduction, against the retro-634 \nwedge. The mesh follows particle motion and indicates total deformation. In cases with erosion the 635 \ntopographic surface is shown in bold. A, no erosion; B, uniform erosion with Ne = 2. The erosion 636 \nnumber characterizes the erosion rate relative to the rate of rock uplift. 637 \n 638 \nFigure 6. Results of numerical simulations showing the difference between landscapes simulated 639 \nwith (a) no vegetation cover and (b) static vegetation cover. Both landscapes are in topographic 640 \nsteady-state, where there is no trend in mean elevation over time (although inevitable fluctuations 641 \nabout a long term mean occur due to stochastic climate forcing and static erosion thresholds).
