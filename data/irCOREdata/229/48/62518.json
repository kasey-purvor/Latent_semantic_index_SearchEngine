FLOWERDEW\nBritish Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0ET, UK\nmf@bas.ac.uk\nReceived 5 March 2008, accepted 21 April 2008\nIntroduction\nThe Trinity Peninsula Group (TPG) of northern Graham\nLand, a weakly metamorphosed thick sequence of\npredominantly quartz- and feldspar-rich greywacke, has\ntentatively been correlated with metasedimentary rocks\nexposed along the Bowman Coast of Graham Land (Stubbs\n1968). The base of the TPG is not observed but the\nBowman Coast rocks, here newly defined as the Bowman\nCoast Succession (BCS), is proximal to high-grade\ngneisses, which may represent the local basement. Recent\ngeological mapping along the Bowman Coast has allowed\na revision of the local geology (Fig. 1) and this note\nfocuses on the relationship of the BCS with the adjacent\ngneisses.\nBowman Coast Succession\nThe BCS varies from being relatively undeformed to intensely\nfolded slates and all of the sequencewas later hornfelsed. These\nfactors combined with intermittent exposure and poor rock\naccessibility hinder detailed stratigraphy. The base of the\nsequence was not observed. Stratigraphically, the lowest beds\nconsist of slates, originally mudstones and siltstones with\nrare, thin and persistent quartz-rich sandstone beds. Up-\nstratigraphy the quartz-sandstone beds become thicker and\nmore frequent. The sequence abruptly becomes dominated by\nbuff-weathering, moderately thickly bedded, laminated,\ngraded and cross-laminated southerly-derived quartz-\nsandstones and quartzites. This unit also displays soft\nsediment dewatering and lode structures. Water-lain tuffs\nconformably overly these sandstones and isolated exposures\nof intermediate and silicic lavas are thought to occupy the\nupper-most part of the BCS. The succession is interpreted as\ninitial marine distal turbidites that give way to more proximal,\npossibly non-marine, deposits with thick volcanic units.\nLithologically, the BCS resembles TPG and an association of\nintermediate volcanic rocks with soft sediment is also\nrecorded within the main TPG outcrop at Mount Cardinal.\nAssuming a tectonic setting comparable to the TPG,\nsedimentation may record arc migration through accretionary\nsediments and the emergence of volcanism in the area. The\nBCS may be more extensive as similar lithologies outcrop on\nthe Wilkins Coast (Fraser & Grimley 1972).\nAge of the succession and contact relationships\nA contact is not observed between the BCS and the gneisses.\nThe BCS is extensively intruded by unfoliated granitoids\nwhich have hornfelsed the already deformed sedimentary\nrocks. None of the cross cutting granitoids is reliably\ndated. Recalculations from Hole (1986) and Hole et al.\n(1991) suggest the pink granite at Scharer Bluff is\n169\u0002 11 Ma (whole-rock Rb\u2013Sr isochron). When considered\ntogether with adamellite from the same locality an errorchron\nof 176\u0002 5 Ma results. Whilst this age may be erroneous\nthrough isotopic disequilibrium between the two rock types, it\nis in agreement with the 164\u2013169 Ma ages for more reliably\ndated plutons reported further north on the east coast\n(Pankhurst et al. 2000).\nMuscovite and K feldspar from a foliated granite yields a\nRb\u2013Sr mineral age of 173\u0002 3 Ma. This intrusion does not\ncut the Curran Bluff metasediments as claimed by Hole\n(1986). Unfoliated granite does, itself cutting the dated\nfoliated intrusion and obscuring, over a distance of several\nhundred metres, the relationship between foliated granite\nand metasediment. The 173\u00023 Ma age is valid in that it\neither records the thermal effect of the later granite\nintrusion or cooling of the whole assembly. The BCS is\ntherefore likely to be older than 173\u00023 Ma and correlate\nwith the TPG as the TPG has yielded Triassic metamorphic\nages (Smellie & Millar 1995), rather than the Late Jurassic\nback-arc metasedimentary rocks of north-east Palmer Land\n(Meneilly et al. 1987). Gneisses do occur in close\nproximity to the BCS. Granitic gneisses from Solberg Inlet\nyield a protolith age of 238\u00023 Ma, an age widely\nrecorded in Palmer Land (Flowerdew et al. 2006). This\nfieldwork identifies that much of the orthogneiss, including\nthe dated 238 Ma rock, are variably foliated and\ncompositionally banded coarse-grained basic to acidic\nintrusions with extensive, late, or unrelated injection and\nveining in places. The term igneous complex is therefore\ngiven for these rocks.\nParagneisses are associated with extensive late leucocratic\ngranite and aplite veining. The paragneisses contain garnet-\nor amphibole-bearing leucosomes, are extensively intruded\nby granitoids and the whole assembly, here termed\nmetamorphic complex, was folded and foliated during\nwhich amphibolite-facies metamorphic minerals grew. The\n511\nAntarctic Science 20 (5), 511\u2013512 (2008) & Antarctic Science Ltd 2008 2008 Printed in the UK doi:10.1017\/S0954102008001399\nmetamorphic complex in many ways resembles that at Auriga\nNunataks, north-west Palmer Land (Vaughan et al. 1999),\nwith which they may correlate. The age of the\nmetamorphism affecting the Bowman Coast metamorphic\ncomplex is not directly dated. However, the pre-\nmetamorphic granitoids cutting the paragneiss are\ntexturally and compositionally similar to the 238\u00023 Ma\nigneous complex and are likely to be co-magmatic. The\nsedimentary protolith has alternating quartz-rich psammite\nand pelite bands, in many ways resembling a high-grade\nBCS. Indeed, paragneiss within the metamorphic complex\nbetween Stubbs Pass and Pylon Point (Fig. 1) becomes\nmore schistose, contains fewer (mostly not garnet-bearing)\nleucosomes, is mylonitised by south-east dipping high\nstrain zones and gives the impression of decreasing\nmetamorphic grade eastwards. Rocks of a similar nature are\nmapped along small parts of Solberg Inlet and on Tonkin\nIsland.\nParagneiss within the metamorphic complex and the BCS\nmay in fact represent different parts of the same sedimentary\nprotolith, different crustal levels of an accretionary prism\nthrough which a Triassic magmatic arc has developed.\nGranitoid - BCS contacts the represent the highest crustal\nlevels while the igneous and metamorphic complexes\ndocument the interaction of voluminous arc plutonism with\nthe sedimentary protolith host at a lower crustal level. To\nsome extent, therefore, an oblique cross section through the\nmiddle crust of a Triassic arc is exposed at the Bowman\nCoast. Uplift from lower crustal levels is evident from\ndecompression textures such as plagioclase corona around\ngarnet in some paragneisses, and was further facilitated by\nductile shear zones and by ascent within the late plutons.\nFuture work will test the validity of this model by\ndetermining whether or not the metamorphic complex is\nolder and unrelated to the BCS and Triassic arc and\nwhether or not the BCS is a correlative of the TPG.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work could not have been achieved without the tireless\nwork of the operations and air unit staff at Rothera research\nstation and field assistant Catrin Thomas.
