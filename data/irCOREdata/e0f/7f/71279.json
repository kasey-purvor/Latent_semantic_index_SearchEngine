The\nVS AIMM algorithm provides the best estimation of the\nturn rate.\nKeywords: IMM, adaptive estimation, target tracking,\ncoordinated turn model\n1  Introduction\nThe Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm is one of\nthe  most  effective  among  the  multiple model\nalgorithms used to overcome the usually arising\nuncertainty about the states and parameters of dynamic\nsystems [1,6,7]. Discretizing the continuous domain of the\nunknown control parameters, the system behaviour is\nconsidered as a sequence of system transitions among a\nfinite number of known discrete system modes, differing\nby their particular control parameters. The discretization\nstep of the uncertainty domain predetermines the number\nof IMM models, the estimation accuracy, and the required\ncomputational load, which may turn out to be\nunacceptably high in certain circumstances. That is why\nthe question \u201chow to decrease  the  IMM models\u2019 number\nwithout significant loss of accuracy?\u201d  is considered in a\nnumber  of issues. This question  is  especially  topical  for\n IMM tracking with the coordinated turn (CT) model\n[1,2,4].\nThe CT model [1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13] is widely applied in\nIMM tracking applications design. It describes target\nmaneuvers performed with constant turn rate, at constant\nheight (the case of civilian aircraft) [1, p.77-78]. For\nmilitary aircraft the assumption that the turn rate is known\nis less natural and the domain of unknown turn rates is\nsignificantly larger. Often, a single CV model and a\nconsiderable number of CT models are usually\nimplemented to design a tracker with a fixed structure (FS)\nIMM algorithm (IMM-CV\/CT) [8, 9], capable to cover a\nwide range of maneuvers. As it is known the FS algorithm\nuses a predetermined fixed set of models [7]. The required\ncomputational load depends on the number of models.\nA brief analysis of solutions decreasing the number of\nIMM-CV\/CT models is presented in Section 2. FS IMM\nalgorithms using augmented CT models (ACT) and\nvariable structure (VS) IMM designs using standard or\nACT models are applied for this purpose. Here, two new\nIMM-CV\/CT algorithms are proposed and evaluated in\nSections 3-5. The basic idea of the Augmented IMM\n(AIMM) algorithm is considered and a new VS AIMM\nalgorithm is proposed in Section 3. Two particular FS and\nVS AIMM-ACV\/ACT algorithms using single augmented\nCV (ACV) model and two ACT models are developed in\nSection 4. Applying Monte Carlo simulation in Section 5,\nthese algorithms are compared to a VS IMM-CV\/CT\nalgorithm similar to those described in [4], for a\nparticularly hard scenario. All investigated algorithms\ndemonstrate very good performance. Finally, inferences\nand notes are given in Section 6.\n2  IMM-CV\/CT algorithms\nThe CT model [1, 2, 8, 9] represents the exact kinematics\nof a turn, performed in horizontal plane, with known\nconstant angular rate w :\nx F x Gvk CT k k= +- -1 1 .\nIts state vector [ ]x X X Y Yk k k k k= , \u0000 , , \u0000 '  includes aircraft\nCartesian coordinates and their derivatives; T  is the\nsampling interval; the scalar system noise is white and\nGaussian, ( )n k CTN Q~ ,0 . Matrices FCT  and G  have\nthe form:\nF\nT T\nT T\nT T\nT T\nCT =\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n1 0 1\n0 0\n0 1 1\n0 0\nsin cos\ncos sin\ncos sin\nsin cos\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw w\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw w\n,\nG\nT\nT\nT\nT\n=\n\u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n1\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n.\nand w > 0  for counterclockwise turns.\nThe CT model is usually jointly implemented with the\nconstant velocity (CV) model [1, 2, 4, 7-9] describing the\nuniform target motion:\nx F x Gvk CV k k= +- -1 1 ,\nwhere\nF\nT\nTCV\n=\n\u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n.\nThe above models are often augmented to cover a\nlarge range of possible target maneuvers using minimal\nnumber of models. Wang, Kirubarajan and Bar-Shalom\ninvestigate three ACT models in [13]. They are obtained\naugmenting the standard CV and CT model by the\nunknown turn rate w k , which is included in the state\nvector [ ]x X X Y Yka k k k k k= , \u0000 , , \u0000 , 'w , and it is no more\nconsidered as a control parameter. Then, the nonlinear\nACT model is once expanded in a Taylor series up to first-\norder, and once more \u2013 up to second-order terms, to\ndevelop a respective extended Kalman filter (EKF). The\nthird IMM-CV\/CT algorithm uses the Kastella\u2019s CT model\nversion, which is implemented in a respective EKF, too.\nEach of the three designed standard IMM algorithms uses\na single CV model and a single ACT model. It is finally\nnoted, that the three algorithms yield similar performance.\nLi and Bar-Shalom [8] have designed three other\nadaptive FS IMM-CV\/CT algorithms for industrial\napplication. The first one uses standard CV and CT\nmodels applying least squares turn rate estimation, but it\ndoes not possess sufficient capabilities to track systems,\nwhose turn rate rapidly changes. Both versions of the\nsecond proposed algorithm use a single ACV and two or\nfour ACT models. The turn rate is treated as a random\nvariable with certain known expected value and variance.\nThe maneuvering models correspond to different levels of\n the above expected turn rates, respectively. The standard\nIMM algorithm configuration is modified with an\ninstantaneous feeding of the expected turn rate to the\nmaneuver model(s) after the ACV interaction step [8,\np.193]. Both algorithms reduce the noise during the\nuniform motion while maintaining the estimation accuracy\nbetter than unfiltered raw measurements [8, p.186].\nA VS IMM-CT\/CV algorithm is proposed by Munir\nand Atherton in [9]. The CT model is decomposed along\neach axis in two independent models, and further\naugmented by the corresponding linear accelerations\n\u0001 \u0001\nX and \n\u0001 \u0001\nY . The turn rate w k  is calculated at each step as\nthe magnitude of the acceleration divided by the target\nspeed. The proposed algorithm outperforms the standard\nFS IMM-CV\/CT algorithm, when the turn rate range is not\nfully covered by the standard IMM models.\nAnother, higher quality performance is reported in [4].\nAttractive estimation accuracy and significant reduction of\nthe computational load is achieved due to the application\nof the advanced variable structure (VS) IMM approach [5-\n7]. Introducing grids of turn rates it becomes possible to\ndevelop switching grid IMM (SGIMM) and adaptive grid\nIMM (AGIMM) algorithms using a single standard CV\nand two CT models. Their performance is compared to\nthose of a standard FS IMM using a complete set of CT\nmodels, and the AGIMM algorithm performance is proven\nto be the best.\nSummarizing the above survey, it may be stated that\nthe simple inclusion of control parameters in the state\nmodel does not automatically provide improved IMM\nalgorithm performance. As a rule, the control parameters\nincluded in the new state vector are initially set to values\nplaced at the center of the former parameter domain [13].\nEach time, when the system jumps into a new mode, such\nEKF starts its motion from this initially preset mode.\nEvidently, some period of time is needed to reach the new\nsystem mode, and this period is larger than the respective\ntime needed to reach the new mode if non-collocating\nmodels are used. Because of this performance de-\nterioration, the above mentioned IMM algorithms have\nyielded place to the more efficient VS algorithms like the\nrecently proposed VS IMM ones [4]. However, due to the\n\u201cartificial\u201d nature of the VS IMM algorithms, it is not easy\nto design appropriate particular parameter grids and\nswitching rules for SGIMM or model management for\nAGIMM. Also it is difficult to develop efficient VS IMM\nalgorithms in conditions far from the initially assumed.\nThat is why the idea to apply new approaches combining\nthe advantages of having the control vector estimated and\nthe mobility of the VS IMM algorithms is topical.\nApplying the recently proposed Augmented IMM\napproach [10-12], FS and VS AIMM algorithms are\nproposed and investigated in the present paper.\n Results concerning the IMM algorithm developed in\n[13] are not presented here. Preliminary simulations\nshowed that the achieved estimation accuracy is\nsignificantly lower than those reported here. It is possible\nthat our results are not sufficiently representative, because\nof the lack of complete information in [13] about the\nparticular algorithm parameters design.\n3  FS and VS AIMM algorithms\nThe efficiency of the AIMM approach has been validated\nin [10-12]. It has been successfully applied in such\nimportant practical applications as maneuvering aircraft\nand maneuvering ship tracking [10,11], as well as for fault\ndetection and parameter drift estimation [12]. Maintaining\nnon-collocating models, it estimates the unknown control\nparameters. As a result it adequately follows the abrupt\nchanges in the system behaviour using small number of\naugmented models.\n3.1 Fixed-Structure Augmented IMM\nAlgorithm\nTo describe the idea of the AIMM algorithm let us\nconsider the stochastic hybrid system:\n( ) ( )x f x p g p vk k k k k= +- - - -1 10 10 1, ,         (1)\n( )z h x wk k k k= + ,                  (2)\nwhere xk\nnx\n\u02db \u00b4  is the system state vector estimated\nbased on the measurement vector zk\nnz\n\u02db \u00b4  in the\npresence of unknown vector of the true control parameters\npk\nn p0\n\u02db \u00b4 . The additive system and measurement noises\nvk\nnv\n\u02db \u00b4  and wk\nnz\n\u02db \u00b4  are mutually independent,\nwhite, Gaussian: ( )n k kN Q~ ,0  and ( )w N Rk k~ ,0 .\nFunctions f , g  and h  are known and remain\nunchanged during the estimation procedure.\nTo estimate the difference (displacement) D pi k,\nbetween the current true control parameters pk\n0\n and their\nvalues pi   fixed in the i -th IMM model, the system state\nmodel is augmented by the following simple set of\nequations:\nD D\np pi k i k, ,= - 1 , ( D pi ,0 0= ).               (3)\nThe difference\nD\np p pi k k i, = -\n0\n,               (4)\nfor all i  must obey the restrictions D p pi k i, + \u02db\n[ ]p pi imin max, , providing given minimal and maximal\nseparation distances between the models. They prevent\npossible models\u2019 merge or displacements.\nThe augmented state and system noise vectors of the\ni -th augmented model ( i N= 1, ) is written as:\n[ ]x x pi ka i k i k n nx p, ,' ,' '= \u02db \u00b4 +D , [ ]n n n ni ka i k p n ni k p, ,' ' ',= \u02db \u00b4 + .\nIn general, the new model is nonlinear:\n( ) ( )x f x p p g p p vi ka a i ka i i k a i i k i ka, , , , ,,= + + +- - - -1 1 1 1D D ,  (5)\n( )z h x p p wk a i ka i i k k= + +, ,, D .                (6)\nFunctions f a (.) , ga (.)  and ha (.)  are known and remain\nunchanged during the estimation procedure.\nFurther, the EKF equations are derived by linearization\nof models (5) and (6). Functions ( )f x p pa i k i i k, ,,\n- -\n+1 1D\nand ( )g x p pa i k i i k, ,,\n- -\n+1 1D  are expanded in Taylor\nseries up to first-order terms around the filtered estimate\n\u0002\n, \/xi k k\na\n- -\n1 1 ; the function ( )h x p pa i k i i k, ,, + D  is expanded\nup to first-order terms around the predicted estimate\n\u0002\n, \/xi k k\na\n-\n1  [2, 3]. The equations of the i -th EKF take the\nform:\n\u0002 \u0002\n, \/ , \/ , ,x x Ki k k\na\ni k k\na\ni k\na\ni k= +- 1 g ,             (7)\n( )\u0003 \u0003 , \u0003, \/ , \/ , \/x f x p pi k ka a i k ka i i k k- - - - -= +1 1 1 1 1D ,              (8)\n( )g i k k a i k ka i i k kz h x p p, , \/ , \/\u0003 , \u0003= - +- -1 1D ,             (9)\n( )P f P f Qi k ka i x ka i k ka x ka i kai i, \/ , , \/ , ' ,- - - - - -= +1 1 1 1 1 1f ,       (10)\n( )S h P h Ri k x ka i k ka x ka ki i, , , \/ , '= +- 1 ,                              (11)\n( )K P h Si ka i k ka x ka i ki, , \/ , ' ,= - -1 1 ,                    (12)\n( )P P K S Ki k ka i k ka i ka i k i ka, \/ , \/ , , , '= -- 1 ,                           (13)\nwhere Ki k\na\n,\n is the filter gain matrix, Pi k k\na\n, \/  and Qi ka,  are\nthe estimation error covariance and system noise\ncovariance matrices, g i k,  and Si k,  are the filter\ninnovation and its covariance matrix, the system and the\nmeasurement Jacobian are\nf x kai , - =1 ( )\u00b6 \u00b6f x p p xa i k ka i i k k i k ka\u0003 , \u0003 \u0003, \/ , \/ , \/- - - - - -+1 1 1 1 1 1D\nand\nhx k\na\ni ,\n= ( )\u00b6 \u00b6h x xa i k ka i k ka\u0003 \u0003, \/ , \/- -1 1 ;\nf i \u2021 1  is the EKF fudge factor.\nObviously, such indirect inclusion of control\nparameters in the state vector makes them \u201cmanageable\u201d.\nAs it is mentioned in [8], in this case the estimation\naccuracy of these parameters is not very important, as far\nas the other state vector components estimates are of\nmajor interest. What is important is the correct and timely\ndetection of the system maneuver and the fast response of\nthe filter to this detection. For example, estimates D\n\u0003\n, \/pi k k\ncontain useful information about the maneuver starting and\nfinal moments, and about the intensity of the current\nmaneuver. Using these estimates, it also becomes possible\nto develop additional feedback for EKF and IMM\nparameters tuning [10-12]. The considered AIMM\nalgorithm is a FS IMM algorithm, using appropriate model\nadaptation for covering system transitions in a given range\nof system modes. Evidently, it reverts back to the standard\nFS IMM algorithms for \nD\npi k, \u201d 0 .\n3.2 Variable-Structure Augmented IMM\nAlgorithm\nThe FS AIMM algorithm can be easy transformed into a\nnew VS AIMM algorithm by substitution of the constant\nvector of deterministic parameters pi  with the random\nvector of control parameters pi k, - 1 . At the end of each\nscan the last filtered model displacement \nD\n\u0004\n, \/pi k k- -1 1  is\nused to correct the old vector of control parameters\npi k, - 1 :\np p pi k i k i k k, , , \/\n\u0005\n= +\n- - -\n1 1 1D   ( p pi i,0 = ),            (14)\npredicting in this way its new values. The new control\nvector must obey the restrictions\n[ ]p p p pi k i k k i i, , \/ ,min ,max,- - -+ \u02db1 1 1D , for all i .\nAfter the above operation, the model displacement\nD\n\u0006\n, \/pi k k- -1 1  should be set to zero:\nD\n\u0005\n, \/pi k k- - =1 1 0 .                                                 (15)\nOtherwise, it will be taken into account twice in the EKF\nequations. Because of the last correction (15), the EKF\n(7)-(13) starts at each scan with no initial model displace-\nment. The new model displacement (in fact, the displace-\nment\u2019s increment) is generated by eqn. (7), so a new\ncontrol vector should be predicted again at the end of the\nscan.\nThe proposed new VS algorithm has better dynamics\nthan its FS predecessor version. The vector pi k,\naccumulates all estimated increments D\n\u0006\n, \/pi k k- -1 1  of the\ni -th EKF, while the i -th EKF in the FS AIMM algorithm\nis adjusted by the standard IMM\u2019s mixture D \u0006\n, \/pi k k- -1 1 , in\nwhich the estimated dominant displacement is reduced due\nto the usual IMM models interaction.\nFinally, it should be noted, that the proposed here new\nVS AIMM approach is general \u2013 it does not depend on the\nimplemented system and measurement models. The new\nVS AIMM algorithm is an adaptive VS IMM algorithm\nusing minimal number of models that self-adjust their\nlocation in continuous parameter domain.\n4  AIMM algorithms using CT model\nThe designed here AIMM algorithm versions use a single\nACV model and two ACT models for left-turn and right-\nturn motions. They are obtained incorporating the\nequation:\nD Dw wi k i k, ,= - 1 ,\ninto the standard CV and CT models. The difference\nbetween the current true turn rate w k\n0\n and its value w i\nfixed in the i-th model is denoted by D w w wi k k i, = -\n0\n( i = 1 2 3, , ). The FS AIMM control parameters w i  are\nassumed constant: w w1 = max  for left turns, w 2 0=  for\nuniform motion, and w w3 = - max  for right turns.\nThe CV model has the form:\nx F x G vi k\na\nCV\na\ni k\na\nCV\na\ni k, , ,= +- -1 1 ,   i = 2       (16)\nwhere\n[ ]x X X Y Yi ka i k i k i k i k i k, , , , , , ', \u0007 , , \u0007 ,= D w , w w wi k i i k, ,= + D ,\nF\nT\nTCV\na\n=\n\u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n, G\nT\nT\nT\nT\nCV\na\n=\n\u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n\u0153\n1\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0 1\n.\nThe i-th ACT model ( i = 1 3, ) has the form:\nX X X\nT\nY\nT\ni k i k i k\ni k\ni k\ni k\ni k\ni k\n, , ,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\b sin \b cos\n= + -\n-\n- -\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1w\nw\nw\nw\n,\n\b \b\ncos\n\b\nsin\n, , , , ,\nX X T Y Ti k i k i k i k i k= -- - - -1 1 1 1w w ,    (17)\nY X\nT\nY Y\nT\ni k i k\ni k\ni k\ni k i k\ni k\ni k\n, ,\n,\n,\n, ,\n,\n,\n\b cos \b sin\n=\n-\n+ +\n-\n-\n-\n- -\n-\n-\n1\n1\n1\n1 1\n1\n1\n1 w\nw\nw\nw\n,\n\t \t\nsin\n\t\ncos\n, , , , ,\nY X T Y Ti k i k i k i k i k= +- - - -1 1 1 1w w ,\nD D\nD\nw w\nw\ni k i k i kv, , ,= +- -1 1 .\nThe purpose of the scalar turn rate noise vi k, - 1\nD w\n is to take\ninto account possible system maneuvers.\nThe system Jacobi matrix has the form:\n( )f F Mxa CT i ki k, = \u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n\u00b7\nw\n0 11 4\n,  for i = 1 3, ,\nwhere:\nM X\nT T T\nY\nT T T\nk i k k\ni k k i k k i k k\ni k k\ni k k\ni k k i k k i k k\ni k k\n11\n1\n2\n2\n1\n, , \/\n, \/ , \/ , \/\n, \/\n, \/\n, \/ , \/ , \/\n, \/\n\n\n\u000b\ncos sin\n\n\n\u000b\nsin cos\n=\n-\n-\n- +\n-\nw w w\nw\nw w w\nw\n,\nM T X T Y Tk i k k i k k i k k i k k21, , \/ , \/ , \/ , \/\n\n\n\u000b\nsin\n\n\n\u000b\ncos= - +\u00e6\n\u0141\n\u00e7\n\u00f6\n\u0142\n\u00f7\nw w\n,\nM\nT T T\nXk\ni k k i k k i k k\ni k k\ni k k31 2\n1\n,\n, \/ , \/ , \/\n, \/\n, \/\nsin cos \t\f\n=\n- +\n+\nw w w\nw\n           \nw w w\nw\ni k k i k k i k k\ni k k\ni k k\nT T T\nY, \/ , \/ , \/\n, \/\n, \/\ncos sin \n\u000b-\n2\n,\nM T X T Y Tk i k k i k k i k k i k k41, , \/ , \/ , \/ , \/\n\n\n\u000b\ncos\n\n\n\u000b\nsin= - -\u00e6\n\u0141\n\u00e7\n\u00f6\n\u0142\n\u00f7\nw w\n.\nIt is also supposed that only position measurements are\navailable, i.e.\nz Hx wk k k= + ,\nwhere\nH = \u00d8\n\u00ba\n\u0152\n\u00f8\n\u00df\n\u0153\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n.\nThe measurement noise wk  is white Gaussian, with\n( )N R0, .\nIn the VS AIMM algorithm the new control parameter\nw i k,  is predicted at the end of the previous k - 1  scan\nupon the base of its last value w i k, - 1  and the last filtered\nestimate D\n\r\n, \/w i k k- -1 1  (which is later set to zero) :\nw w wi k i k i k k, , , \/\n\r\n= +\n- - -\n1 1 1D .\n5  Simulation results\nBoth AIMM algorithms are compared to a particular\nimplementation of the AGIMM algorithm, considered as\nthe best algorithm among all investigated in [4]. For these\npurposes the same AGIMM algorithm is realized.\n5.1 The AGIMM algorithm [4]\nThe AGIMM algorithm uses a single CV and two CT\nmodels adaptively moved along grids of discrete turn\nrates. These models form a three-model set\nM k = { }w w wkL kC kR, ,  for grid values w w wkL kC kR< < .\nThe algorithm is initially started with the coarse grid\nM0 = { }w w w0 0 0L C R, , = { }w wmax max, ,0 - . Here, the turn\nrate is chosen positive for counterclockwise turns. At each\ncycle k kfi + 1 the center model is determined by the\nprobabilistically weighted sum of the model turn rates:\nw m w m w m wk\nC\nk\nL\nk\nL\nk\nC\nk\nC\nk\nR\nk\nR\n+ = + +1 ,\nwhere m k\nL\n, m k\nC\n, m k\nR\n are the model probabilities at k . In\nthe case where the center model is dominant (i.e. m kC  is\nthe largest), its distance to the left model remains\nunchanged if the left (or right) model is significant in the\nsense 1t\nL\nk \u2021m  (or 1tRk \u2021m ), or otherwise it is reduced by\nhalf:\n\u00ee\n\u00ed\n\u00ec\n+\n<+\n=\n+\n+\n+\notherwise\ntif\nL\nk\nC\nk\nL\nk\nL\nk\nC\nkL\nk\n,\n,2\/\n1\n11\n1\nlw\nmlw\nw\n,\n \n\u00ee\n\u00ed\n\u00ec\n-\n<-\n=\n+\n+\n+\notherwise\ntif\nR\nk\nC\nk\nR\nk\nL\nk\nC\nkR\nk\n,\n,2\/\n1\n11\n1\nlw\nmlw\nw\n,\nwhere Ck\nL\nk\nL\nk wwl -= , \nR\nk\nC\nk\nR\nk wwl -=  are model\ndistances in the given interval [ ]d dw wmin max, . If the left (or\nright) model is dominant, then its distance to the center\nmodel is doubled if 2t\nL\nk >m  (or 2tRk >m ); it remains\nunchanged otherwise.\nEvidently, the difference between the AGIMM and the\nnewly obtained AIMM algorithm versions is in the\nmechanism for the turn rates computation. The AGIMM\nalgorithm control logic does not directly relate to the\nmodels and does not require their modification, while the\nAIMM algorithm uses the EKF abilities for parameter\nidentification.\n5.2 The scenario\nThe scenario simulated here is very similar to those\ndescribed in [4]. It includes few rectilinear stages and few\nCT maneuvers (Figs.1 and 2). Four consecutive 180\n\u000e\nturns with rates w = 1.87, -2.8, 5.6, -4.68 [ o\/s], are\nsimulated, respectively for scans [56,150], [182, 245],\n[285, 314], [343,379].\n1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6\nx 10\n4\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\nx 10\n4\nX m, [ ]\nY m, [ ] k=0\nFigure 1: The test trajectory\nThe initial target position and velocities are X 0 = 60[km],\nY0 = 40[km], \n\u000f\nX 0 172= - [m\/s], \n\u000f\nY0 =  246 [m\/s] (i.e.\naircraft speed 300 [m\/s]).

Their analysis\nleads to the next inferences:\n1. All three investigated IMM algorithms show very\ngood and very close performance. The established AIMM\nturn rate feedback provides significant algorithm\u2019s self-\nadjustment abilities and maneuverability.\n2. The ME plots (Figs. 3, 4) and the plots of the average\nturn rates (Figs. 11-13) confirm the better dynamics of\nboth VS IMM algorithms compared to the FS IMM. The\nAGIMM algorithm is the most \u201cmobile\u201d algorithm due to\nits \u201cartificial\u201d abilities for instantaneous turn rate\nadjustment.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nVS  AIMM\nFS  AIMM\nAGIMM\nk\nFigure 3: Position ME [m]\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nAGIMM\nFS  AIMM\nVS  AIMM\nk\nFigure 4: Velocity ME, [m\/s]\n3.

Fixed structure and variable\nstructure AIMM algorithms using augmented constant\nvelocity and augmented coordinated turn models are\ndeveloped in the paper. The augmented coordinated turn\nmodel includes the difference between the unknown\ncurrent turn rate and its value fixed in the IMM algorithm.\nAs the simulation results show, this inclusion provides\nsignificant self-adjustment abilities to both proposed\nalgorithms, resulting in very good overall accuracy and\nconsistency. Compared to a particular VS adaptive grid\nIMM algorithm, both VS IMM algorithms show higher\nmobility, while the FS AIMM algorithm possesses better\nconsistency. The VS AIMM algorithm provides the best\nestimation of the turn rate.\nReferences\n[1] Bar-Shalom, Y., ed., Multitarget-Multisensor\nTracking: Applications and Advances, Vol.2, Artech\nHouse, 1992.\n[2] Bar-Shalom, Y., and X.R.
