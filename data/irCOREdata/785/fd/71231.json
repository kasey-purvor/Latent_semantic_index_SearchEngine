The photodiode has an extended spectral response\ncompared with other currently available III\u2013V room-temperature detectors. In order to\naccommodate the large lattice mismatch between the InAs0.89Sb0.11 active region and the InAs\nsubstrate, a buffer layer with an intermediate composition was introduced into the structure. In this\nway, we obtained room-temperature photodiodes with a cutoff wavelength near 5 mm, a peak\nresponsivity of 0.8 A\/W, and a detectivity of 1.263109 cm Hz1\/2\/W. These devices could be\neffectively used as the basis of an optical sensor for the environmental monitoring of carbon\nmonoxide at 4.6 mm, or as a replacement for PbSe photoconductors. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of\nPhysics. @S0003-6951~00!02332-9#Infrared photodetectors operating in the range 2\u20135 mm\nhave wide ranging applications and are especially important\nas the key components in gas sensor instrumentation based\non optical absorption.1,2 In particular, there is a need for\nefficient and reliable semiconductor light sources and detec-\ntors, which can be used for CO detection at 4.6 mm. Cur-\nrently, the dominant infrared detector materials appropriate\nfor this application are PbSe, HgCdTe, and InSb. However,\nboth PbSe and HgCdTe are normally used in the photocon-\nductive mode, PbSe has a relatively slow response speed\nwhich limits the modulation frequency and the integration\ntime of the final gas sensor instrument. PbSe also suffers\nfrom undesirable 1\/f noise problems, while HgCdTe nor-\nmally requires thermoelectric cooling below room tempera-\nture in order to achieve a sufficiently high detectivity for\nsuccessful instrumentation. Recent developments in HgCdTe\nhave resulted in a D* in excess of 2.53109 cm Hz1\/2 W21 at\n300 K in the 7\u201311 mm range.3 Photovoltaic InSb, on the\nother hand, is faster and can operate out to 5 mm, but re-\nquires cryogenic cooling to 77 K in order to obtain satisfac-\ntory diode performance. Such factors significantly restrict the\nuse of these detectors in portable gas detection systems, in-\nfrared spectrometers, thermal imaging cameras, and other ap-\nplications where the need to provide cooling of the detector\nelement makes the overall system cumbersome. Clearly there\nis a need for a fast photovoltaic detector operating at room\ntemperature beyond 4 mm. Such a photodetector would be a\nmajor advantage and would have wide ranging applications.\nThe InAs12xSbx ternary alloy is potentially a more\npromising material for mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.\nRecently a number of different approaches and growth tech-\nniques including molecular beam epitaxy,4,5 metalorganic\nvapor phase epitaxy,6,7 and liquid phase epitaxy ~LPE!8\u201310\nhave been investigated. One of the main obstacles in the\ndevelopment of InAs12xSbx devices is the preparation of\na!Electronic mail: a.krier@lancaster.ac.uk8720003-6951\/2000\/77(6)\/872\/3\/$17.00high quality epitaxial layers of appropriate composition on\nInAs substrates. The epitaxial growth of alloys with x\n.0.05 directly on InAs leads to high concentrations of\nShockley\u2013Read recombination centers which limit the de-\nvice quantum efficiency. However, we have found that it is\npossible to overcome this problem and recently we have re-\nported efficient 4.6 mm light emitting diodes with output\npowers in excess of 1 mW operating at room temperature.11\nIn this work, we now turn our attention to the corresponding\ndetector and demonstrate an InAs0.89Sb0.11 photodiode which\noperates at room temperature in the 2.5\u20135 mm mid-infrared\nwavelength range. This was achieved through introducing an\nintermediate composition buffer layer (InAs0.94Sb0.06) be-\ntween the InAs substrate and the InAs0.89Sb0.11 active region\nto relieve strain caused by the lattice mismatch. The detector\nhas an extended spectral response out to longer wavelengths\ncompared with currently available room-temperature detec-\ntors and is therefore well-suited to CO detection as well as\nother gas and flame monitoring applications.\nThe schematic energy band diagram of the double het-\nerostructure InAs0.89Sb0.11 \/InAs0.55Sb0.15P0.30 photodiode is\nshown in Fig. 1. The epitaxial layers were grown by LPE at\n;545 \u00b0C using a conventional horizontal sliding graphite\nboat in an ultrapure hydrogen atmosphere. S-doped ~100!\nn-type InAs substrates were used with a carrier concentration\nof 23108 cm23. The precursors for the growth melts were\nundoped polycrystalline InAs, InSb, InP, and 99.999 99%\npure indium metal. The p-type InAs0.55Sb0.15P0.30 was doped\nto 431018 cm23 with Zn, whereas the n-type\nInAs0.55Sb0.15P0.30 layer was unintentionally doped and had a\nresidual carrier concentration of 131017 cm23. In order to\nremove impurities from the InAs0.89Sb0.11 active region, this\nmelt was baked out for 20 h at 750 \u00b0C before the other melts\nwere loaded into the boat. Then, to purify it still further, a\nlittle Gd ~0.002 mol %! was added to the active region melt\nto act as an impurity gettering agent.12,19 Hall measurements\nrevealed that this procedure reduced the residual carrier con-\ncentration in the active region to ,231016 cm23.\u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics\n873Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 77, No. 6, 7 August 2000 Gao, Krier, and SherstnevIn order to relieve the misfit dislocation density in the\nactive region due to the large mismatch ~0.7%! between the\nInAs0.89Sb0.11 and the InAs substrate, a single 4-mm-thick\nbuffer layer with an intermediate composition of\nInAs0.94Sb0.06 ~0.4% mismatch to InAs substrate! was intro-\nduced into the structure. We favored this single step strain\nrelaxation approach rather than using a multilayer buffer be-\ncause it simplified the growth procedure.13 The undoped\n5-mm-thick InAs0.89Sb0.11 active layer ~i region! was sand-\nwiched between two ~3-mm-thick! InAs0.55Sb0.15P0.30 clad-\nding layers instead of using just a single heterostructure\nwhich we used in our previous work.14 The double hetero-\nstructure is used for carrier confinement in the active region\nand helps prevent the tendency for electron loss to the InAs\nsubstrate. Due to the higher band gap, the upper cladding\nlayer also acts as an effective transparent window layer.\nThe resulting epitaxial positive-intrinsic-negative\n(p-i-n) structures were processed into 300 mm diam mesa-\netched photodiodes using conventional photolithography and\nprocessing techniques. Ohmic contacts were formed by ther-\nmal evaporation of Au to provide ohmic dot contacts, and\nfinally the chips were mounted onto To49 headers for test-\ning. No attempt was made to passivate the surfaces or in-\nclude an antireflection coating at this stage of our work and\nall subsequent results refer to uncoated, unpassivated detec-\ntors. The detectivity, D* and spectral response were mea-\nsured using a chopping frequency of 300 Hz and a blackbody\ntemperature of 1100 K. The recorded spectrum was corrected\nfor system response using a Heimann LHi-807-G11 pyro-\nelectric detector with a flat response.\nFigure 2 shows the 77 K and room-temperature current\u2013\nvoltage (I \u2013 V) characteristics measured from one of the\np-i-n photodiodes fabricated in the present work. The re-\nverse dark current of the photodiode at 0.05 V reverse bias\nwas measured to be approximately 10 mA and 1.5 mA at 77\nand 300 K, respectively. The higher dark current at room\ntemperature is a result of the narrow energy band gap of the\nactive region material in which diffusion current is typically\nthe dominant current conduction mechanism near room tem-\nperature. The reverse breakdown voltage decreases from\n210 to 20.4 V with increasing temperature as the diode\nFIG. 1.

The diode\ndiffusion equation was used to determine the energy band\ngap of the active region.16 A value of 0.267 eV was obtained,\nwhich is consistent with that calculated for an alloy compo-\nsition of InAs0.89Sb0.11 at room temperature.17\nThe zero-bias resistance (R0A) of the photodiode was\nobtained from the slope of the I \u2013 V characteristic near the\norigin. The R0A product was plotted against 1\/T for one of\nthe 300 mm diameter photodiodes as shown in the semilog\nplot of Fig. 3. R0A varies as 1\/ni\n2 and 1\/ni for the diffusion\nand generation-recombination mechanisms, respectively,\nwhere ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration. As shown in\nFig. 3. in the temperature range above 170 K, the R0A prod-\nuct follows the diffusion model, whereas in the temperature\nrange between 77 and 170 K, R0A against T fits a\ngeneration-recombination model. This result is similar to our\nprevious findings for In0.97Ga0.03As\/InAs0.36Sb0.20P0.44 3.3\nmm photodiodes.10,14 But, in the present case for these 4.6\nmm photodiodes, the diffusion current remains dominant\ndown to 170 K.\nThe room temperature photoresponse of the\nInAs0.89Sb0.11 photodiode is shown in Fig. 4.

Lett., Vol. 77, No. 6, 7 August 2000 Gao, Krier, and Sherstnevusing Gd as a gettering agent to purify the active region is\nclearly evident. A significant improvement in the photodiode\nperformance was obtained for the purified diode due to the\nremoval of impurities from the active region and the corre-\nsponding reduction in residual carrier concentration from\n;1017 to ;1016 cm23. These findings are in good agreement\nwith our previous results for gettering in both LPE grown\nInAs epitaxial layers and InAsSb LEDs.18,19 Gong et al. have\nalso observed similar improvements in shorter wavelength\nphotodiodes.20 A peak responsivity of 0.8 A\/W was obtained\nat a wavelength of 4.6 mm, with a cutoff near 5 mm. In the\ndetector with the purified active region the cutoff wavelength\nis increased a little, which is again consistent with the re-\nmoval of shallow ~donor! impurities from the active region.\nThe room temperature detectivity, D* of the photodiode\nwas calculated from the Johnson noise limited equation21 and\nwas determined to be 1.263109 cm Hz1\/2\/W at 4.6 mm. The\ncorresponding quantum efficiency was estimated to be 22%\nat this wavelength. The performance of the photodiodes\nmade in our laboratory is compared with that of other com-\nmercially available photodetectors in Fig. 5. Clearly the\nFIG. 4.

The room-temperature detectivity at 4.6 mm is\napproximately five times higher than that of a typical 300 K\nPbSe photoconductive detector at the same wavelength and\nis only three times lower than that of the 77 K PbSe detector.\nOnly HgCdTe ~260 K! and InSb ~77 K! significantly outper-\nform our photodiode but these need thermoelectric or liquid\nnitrogen cooling which makes them less attractive for prac-\ntical applications.\nIn summary, an uncooled mid-infrared photodetector\nwith a long cutoff wavelength has been made based on an\nInAs0.89Sb0.11 \/InAs0.55Sb0.15P0.30 double heterostructure di-\node grown by LPE on an InAs substrate. Basic detector char-\nacteristics have been measured from unpassivated mesa-\netched devices. The surface illuminated photodiodes\nexhibited a cutoff wavelength of ;5 mm at room tempera-\nture, with a peak responsivity of 0.8 A\/W and a Johnson-\nnoise limited detectivity of 1.263109 cm Hz0.5\/W. Although\nsome further optimization is required, we consider these de-\nvices to be a major step towards a LED-photodiode based\nCO gas sensor.\nThe authors wish to thank Kidde International for pro-\nviding a studentship for H.H.G.
