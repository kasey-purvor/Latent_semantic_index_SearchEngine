Introduction 20 \nA repairable system is a system which, after failing to perform one or more of its functions 21 \nsatisfactorily, can be restored to fully satisfactory performance by any method, rather than the 22 \nreplacement of the entire system (Ascher and Feingold, 1984). Repair models developed upon 23 \nsuccessive inter-failure times have been employed in many applications such as the optimisation of 24 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n2 \nmaintenance policies, decision making and whole life cycle cost analysis. With different repair levels, 25 \nrepair can be broken down into three categories (Yamez et al, 2002): perfect repair, normal repair and 26 \nminimal repair. A perfect repair can restore a system to an \u201cas good as new\u201d state, a normal repair is 27 \nassumed to bring the system to any condition, and a minimal repair, or imperfect repair, can restore the 28 \nsystem to the exact state it was before failure. Example models for perfect, normal, and minimal repair 29 \nare renewal process (RP) models or homogeneous Poisson process (HPP) models, generalised renewal 30 \nprocesses, and non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) models, respectively. On the basis of the 31 \nrelationship between failure intensities and time, repair models fall into three categories: models with a 32 \nconstant failure intensity (e.g. HPP models), models with an operating-time dependent failure intensity 33 \n(e.g. NHPP models) and models with a repair-time dependent failure intensity (e.g. geometric processes 34 \n(GP) models (Lam, 1988)).  35 \nIn reality, the survival times of a system after each repair can become shorter and shorter due to 36 \nvarious reasons such as ageing and deterioration. The working times and repair times can be modeled by 37 \ngeometric processes as many authors have studied (Lam, 1988; Wu and Clements-Croome, 2005; Zhang 38 \nand Wang, 2007). The geometric process introduced by Lam (1988) defines an alternative to the non-39 \nhomogeneous Poisson process: a sequence of random variables {Xk, k=1,2,...} is a geometric process if 40 \nthe distribution function of Xk is given by F(ak-1t) for k=1,2,... and a is a positive constant. Wang and 41 \nPham (1996) later refer the geometric process as a quasi-renewal process. Finkelstein (1993) develops a  42 \nmodel: he defines a general deteriorating renewal process such that Fk+1(t) \u0001 Fk(t). Wu and Clements-43 \nCroome (2006) extend the geometric process by replacing its parameter ak-1 with a1ak-1+ b1bk-1, where 44 \na>1 and 0<b<1. The geometric process has been applied to reliability analysis and maintenance policy 45 \noptimisation for various systems by authors; for example, Wu and Clements-Croome (2005), Castro and 46 \n\u0002\u0003rez-\u0004\u0005\u0006n (2006), Zhang and Wang (2007), and Braun et al (2008). 47 \nThe existing research mainly concentrates on the reliability analysis or maintenance optimisation with 48 \na consideration of the behaviours of repairable systems themselves. Little work has been conducted to 49 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n3 \nconsider reliability analysis for a system where the repairman might take a sequence of vacations of 50 \nrandom durations and a repair on a failure is a normal repair. Here we emphasize that the durations of 51 \nvacations can be different. Such a vacation policy is called a multiple vacation policy, which has 52 \nattracted attention in queuing theory (for example, Lee, 1988; Krishna et al, 1998; Chang and Choi, 53 \n2005).  54 \nThe applications of such situations where a repairman can take multiple vocations can be found in 55 \npractice. In some situations, a repairman can have two roles: one for caring a system and one for other 56 \nduties, which can happen in a small\/median firm that wants to use the repairman effectively. If the 57 \nrepairman is assigned to look after only one system, he might have plenty of idle time. In this paper, 58 \nvocation can mean period when the repairman is on other duties. The repairman can periodically check 59 \nthe status of the system: if the system fails, he repairs it; if the system is working, he goes back to the 60 \nother duties. Allocating the manpower of the repairman in such a way is more realistic and more 61 \nprofitable than simply assigning him a single role of being a repairman. 62 \nThis paper presents the formulations of the expected long-run profit per unit time for a repairable 63 \nsystem with a repairman. We assume that the repairman takes multiple vacations. When the system fails, 64 \nthe repairman will be called in to bring the system back to a certain state. The time to repair is composed 65 \nof two different periods: waiting and real repair periods. The waiting time starts from the component\u2019s 66 \nfailure to the start to repair, and the real repair time is the time between the start to repair and the 67 \ncompletion of the repair. Both the working and real repair times are assumed to be a type of stochastic 68 \nprocesses: geometric processes, and the waiting times are subject to a renewal process. The probability 69 \nthat a failed system can be immediately repaired is assumed to be p. The expected long-run profit per 70 \nunit time is derived and a numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results of the model. 71 \nThe paper is structured as follows. The coming section introduces geometric processes defined by 72 \nLam (1988), and assumptions. Sections 3 and 4 derives the expected long-run profit per unit time, and 73 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n4 \ndiscusses special cases, respectively. Section 5 offers numerical examples. Concluding remarks are 74 \noffered in the last section.  75 \n2. Definitions and Model Assumptions  76 \nThis section first borrows the definition of geometric processes from Lam (1988), and then makes 77 \nassumptions for model development. 78 \n2.1 Definition 79 \nDefinition 1  Assume \u03be , \u03b7  are two random variables. For arbitrary real number \u03b1 , there is 80 \n(P \u03be \u0007\u03b1 ) > (P \u03b7 \u0007\u03b1 )  81 \nthen \u03be  is called stochastically bigger than \u03b7 .  Similarly, if  82 \n(P \u03be \u0007\u03b1 ) < (P \u03b7 \u0007\u03b1 )  83 \nthen \u03be  is called stochastically smaller than \u03b7 . 84 \nDefinition 2 (Lam, 1988) Assume that { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is a sequence of independent non-negative 85 \nrandom variables. If the distribution function of nX  is )( 1taF n\u2212 ,  for some a>0 and all, n=1,2, \u2026, then 86 \n{ nX , n=1,2,\u2026}  is called a geometric process. 87 \nObviously,  88 \nif a >1, then { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is stochastically decreasing, 89 \nif a <1, then  { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is stochastically increasing, and 90 \nif a =1, { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is a renewal process. 91 \n2.2 Assumptions 92 \nThe following assumptions are assumed to hold in what follows. 93 \nA. At time t=0, the system is new. 94 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n5 \nB. The system starts to work at time t=0, and it is maintained by a repairman. The repairman takes his 95 \nfirst vacation after the system has started. After his vacation ends, there will be two situations.  96 \n(a) If the system has failed and is waiting for repair, the repairman will repair it. He will then take 97 \nhis second vacation after the repair is completed.  98 \n(b) If the system is still working, the repairman will take his second vacation. This operating policy 99 \ncontinues until a replacement takes place.     100 \nC. After the repairman finishes his vacation, the probability that he can immediately repair the failed 101 \nsystem is p. Denote \nnV  as the waiting time after the nth failure occurs, where { nV , n =1,2,\u2026} are 102 \nindependently and identically distributed with distribution )0()( \u2265ttS  and +\u221e<= nEV\u03c4 . 103 \nD. The time interval from the completion of the (n-1)th repair to that of the nth repair of the system is 104 \ncalled the nth cycle of the system, where ,2,1=n \u2026. Denote the working time and the repair time of 105 \nthe system in the nth cycle ( ,2,1=n \u2026) as nX  and nY , respectively. Denote the length of the ith 106 \nvacation during the nth cycle as { inZ ,n=1,2,?}. Denote the cumulative distribution functions of 107 \nnX , nY , \ni\nnZ  and )(xFn  as )(yGn , and )(zH n , respectively, where )()( 1xaFxF nn \u2212= , 108 \n)()( 1 ybGyG nn \u2212= , and )()( 1zdHzH nn \u2212= . Denote )( 1XE = \u03bb , )( 1YE = \u00b5 , and )( 11ZE =\u03b3 .        109 \nE. nX , nY , \ni\nnZ , and nV  (i=1,2,\u2026 and ,2,1=n \u2026) are statistically independent. 110 \nF. When a replacement is required, a brand new but identical component will be used, and the length 111 \nof a replacement time is negligible. 112 \nG. The following costs are considered: 113 \n\u2022 1C : repair cost per unit time; 114 \n\u2022 2C : reward per unit time when the system is working; 115 \n\u2022 3C : cost incurred for a replacement; 116 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n6 \n\u2022 4C : reward per unit of the repairman when he is taking vacation or other duties, which can 117 \nproduce profits for the firm; 118 \n\u2022 5C : cost per unit time when the system is waiting for repair; and 119 \n\u2022 6C : cost per unit time incurred in the waiting time after the system has failed. 120 \n3. Expected profit under replacement policy N  121 \nDenote n\u03b7  the times of vacations of the repairman during the nth cycle of the system. A typical 122 \nprogress is given in Figure 1.  123 \nFigure 1 here 124 \nFigure 1. A typical progress of the system 125 \nLet 1T  be the time before the first replacement, nT  be the time between  the (n-1)th and nth 126 \nreplacement with n=2,3,\u2026. The process { nT , n=1, 2,\u2026} forms a renewal process. Denote )(NP  as the 127 \nexpected long-run profit per unit time under replacement policy N, then we have 128 \n                    )(NP =\n\u221e\u2192t\nlim\nt\nt][0,hin  profit wit Expected \n                         129 \nSince { nT ,n=1,2,?} is a renewal process, the time between two adjacent replacements is the length 130 \nfor a replacement.

Numerical examples 205 \nIn this section, we will give examples to demonstrate the theoretical results of our model.  206 \n5.1 Sensitivity analysis for the repair times influencing the profit  207 \nIf we set =a 1.1, 98.0=b , =\u03bb 100, =\u00b5 1, =1C 20, =2C 500, =3C 5000, =4C 200, =6C 100, =\u03c4 0.2,  208 \nand 8.0=p , then the optimum number for a replacement will be N=8, and the corresponding expected 209 \nlong-run profit per unit time is 535.09. The change of value P(N) with repair times N is shown in Figure 210 \n2. The value P(N) increases rapidly when repair times changes from 1 to 8, and then decreases slowly 211 \nwhen repair times increases. This indicates that the expected long-run profit per unit time is more 212 \nsensitive to big values of N*. In case it is not possible to undertake a replacement when repair times 213 \nreaches N*(=8), we can replace the system after more repairs have been conducted, rather than less. This 214 \nis because larger N* (3 < N* <13, say) tends to have greater profit, whereas smaller N* might not have 215 \ngood profits (N*<4). 216 \nFigure 2 here 217 \nFigure 2 The expected long-run profit per unit time P(N) against repair times N. 218 \na N* P(N*) a N* P(N*) a N* P(N*) \n1.01 17 665.03 1.18 6 459.75 1.35 5 367.5 \n1.02 15 650.42 1.19 6 452.3 1.36 5 363.7 \n1.03 13 634.58 1.2 6 445.19 1.37 5 360.03 \n1.04 12 618.46 1.21 6 438.4 1.38 4 356.47 \n1.05 11 602.68 1.22 6 431.9 1.39 4 353.03 \n1.06 10 587.58 1.23 6 425.68 1.4 4 349.69 \n1.07 10 573.27 1.24 6 419.72 1.41 4 346.46 \n1.08 9 559.78 1.25 5 414.01 1.42 4 343.33 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n11 \n1.09 9 547.07 1.26 5 408.52 1.43 4 340.29 \n1.1 8 535.09 1.27 5 403.24 1.44 4 337.34 \n1.11 8 523.79 1.28 5 398.17 1.45 4 334.47 \n1.12 8 513.12 1.29 5 393.3 1.46 4 331.69 \n1.13 7 503.02 1.3 5 388.6 1.47 4 328.98 \n1.14 7 493.46 1.31 5 384.07 1.48 4 326.35 \n1.15 7 484.38 1.32 5 379.7 1.49 4 323.8 \n1.16 7 475.76 1.33 5 375.49 1.5 4 321.31 \n1.17 7 467.56 1.34 5 371.43    \nTable 1: The expected long-run profit per unit time against the values of a and N*. 219 \n5.2 Sensitivity analysis for parameters a and N 220 \nIf we keep the values of parameters in Section 5.1, apart from the parameter a, we obtain results shown 221 \nin Table 1. Table 1 shows how the optimum repair times N* and the expected long-run profit per unit 222 \ntime change when parameter a changes from 1.01 to 1.5. From Table 1, we have the following results. 223 \n\u2022 We can see that the optimum N* is sensitive to a small change of parameter a when a is smaller 224 \nthan 1.1: the optimum N* change from 17 to 9. The optimum N*  becomes stable when  a is 225 \nlarger than 1.1: it changes from 8 to 7 when a changes from 1.11 to 1.21. The N*  remains even 226 \nmore stable when a is larger than 1.21.  227 \n\u2022 The expected long-run profit per unit time for smaller a, for example, changing from 1.01 to 228 \n1.05, changes faster than that for larger a. As we can image, smaller a\u2019s  are more profitable than 229 \nlarger a\u2019s. This is because they require fewer replacements and earn greater profit. 230 \nFigure 3 shows all of the changes over parameter a and repair times N, which gives a visual description 231 \non the changes of the expected long-run profits, parameter a and failure times N. 232 \nFigure 3 here 233 \nFigure 3 The expected long-run profit per unit time P(N) against repair times N and parameter a. 234 \n6.
