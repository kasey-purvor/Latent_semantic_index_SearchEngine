For example, in the first year of the course they are expected to design and\ntest some basic circuits using data available on the characteristics of the semiconductor\ndevices to be used. Many of the students cannot be prepared sufficiently for this activity\nby attendance at lectures, in which basic principles are expounded to large classes. First-\nyear students have widely differing knowledge, experience and ability in circuit design.\nTherefore, without individual tuition many of them are insufficiently prepared for their\nlaboratory work. Weaker students often neglect to study the laboratory documentation\nthoroughly in advance and they make poor progress in the laboratory.\nWe are developing computer-based tutorials specifically designed to prepare students for\nlaboratory work by enabling them to grasp the relevant theory and carry out preliminary\ncalculations in a self-paced interactive environment made interesting by the use of\ngraphics and animation. In this way, students are enticed to prepare in advance for the\nlaboratory. While they would like simply to be given the answers, they are required to\nearn them in a structure where lecture material is reinforced and they are exposed to\n49\nGordon Ritchie and Paul Gamer Enhancing laboratory activity\nmethodical procedures. With highly-motivated and able students the printed word can\nsuffice but Computer-Based Learning (CBL) is ideal for interactive study enhanced by use\nof colour and animation; in many spheres it is still a novel medium.\nThe computer-based laboratory tutorial\nWritten using Authorware Professional, our computer-based laboratory tutorials guide\nelectronics students through the preliminary work they are expected to carry out before\ncoming into the teaching laboratory. They are taken through successive procedures and\ndetail of the experiments; their prerequisite knowledge and understanding of material are\ntested as the tutorial progresses. They extract from data (a skill on its own) typical device\nparameter values and apply them in preliminary design and calculation of circuit\nperformance. Access to relevant circuit diagrams is provided, as is the ability to return to\nearlier material. Throughout the tutorials, on-line reference is provided to the\nrecommended text which has been adapted to disk as required. Also, at specific points in\nthe tutorial, the reference text can be accessed directly at the relevant section. The\nessential theory inevitably requires the use of text and equations but such material is\ninterspersed with questions and answers which provide interactive work for the student.\nGraphical material is used wherever possible and is animated by, for example, moving\ncomponents and connections around in circuit diagrams. Colour is used to distinguish\ndifferent variables such as voltages at different points in a circuit.\nStudents are guided through the application of theory in the specific context of the\npractical laboratory experiment. This requires at least a basic knowledge of the subject, as\nno attempt is made to develop the subject from fundamentals as would be done in a\nlecture course. However, the reference text is at hand.\nPotentially the computer-based tutorial is very compact, with the PC\/terminal capable of\nhandling extra items such as the experiment script itself, reference texts and data material,\ncalculator, notepad, etc. in additional windows.\nIt may be suggested that this preparation is rather passive. On the contrary, students are\ninvolved in significant activity while they interact within the tutorial. And, although they\nwork in the tutorial with typical values extracted from data sheets, in the actual\nlaboratory they have to recalculate using real measured values of parameters. This\nrepetition serves further to reinforce the material.\nOn-line referencing\nA disk version of the recommended textbook (Ritchie, 1993) was available. Unfortunately\nthis was intended for typesetting purposes rather than end-user consumption. It contained\nmany commands for controlling fonts, sizes and spacing which had to be deleted. Figures\nhad to be scanned from the printed text and cleaned up before inserting. Also, equations\nhad to be reconstructed. These processes were very time-consuming.\nAccess to the relevant chapter of the reference text (423K) from the tutorial uses the\n50\nALT-} Volume 3 Number I\nAuthorware JumpFileReturn function which, by passing the page number of the\nreference, allows access to the specified reference point. Using packaged files, access is\nrapid (seven seconds using a 25 MHz 486 PC). The facility to browse either side of the\nreference point is provided. Quitting the reference returns (in five seconds) to the exit\npoint from the tutorial. It is interesting to note that JumpFileReturn functions may be\nnested, thus enabling referencing within references.\nConsumer reaction\nThe first of these tutorials was written for the First-Year Hardware Laboratory in the\nElectronics Department at the University of York, supporting an experiment on field-\neffect transistors (FETs). Running this tutorial met with unqualified enthusiasm from\nstudents and staff. The value is immense, introducing a new structured phase into the\nactive learning process which engenders confidence and competence. In comparison with\nprevious cohorts, staff were impressed by the extremely searching questions posed by the\nmost able students and by the improved level of understanding shown by their weaker\ncolleagues.\nAll students, strong and weak, enjoyed the tutorial and found it very useful. It\ncomplemented the lecture course on FETs as well as reinforcing it, and was valuable for\nrevision. Being able to work at their own speed was appreciated. There were many\nrequests that the computer-based laboratory support be extended to cover lecture\nmaterial as well.\nSome students felt that answers to questions in the tutorial were provided too readily, but\nan authoring decision had been taken specifically to direct the tutorial towards the\nlaboratory experiment and not to a study of the general field. In doing so, students are\nguided through a logical approach to the work which in itself, as with case studies and\ndesign examples, forms an informative and stimulating experience.\nYet more interaction, animation and graphics have been requested. As with printed\nmaterial, content and presentation are under continuous review and future versions will\nenhance the offering.\nProblems\nUnfortunately, a CBL framework has its drawbacks, especially the overhead of expensive\nauthoring time. Even with experience, it is unlikely that one hour of quality screen\ntutorial can be produced in less than forty hours. A laboratory experiment (like a lecture\ncourse) tends to be very parochial, having been developed by an individual member of\nstaff over several years. Invariably, investment has been made in specialized equipment\nand circuit boards. So it is unlikely that there exists CBL material which is immediately\napplicable to an experiment - one has to start from scratch. However, fewer staff are\nrequired to demonstrate in the laboratory; this saving can be diverted to generating new\nmaterial.\n51\nGordon Ritchie and Paul Gamer Enhancing laboratory activity\nA significant problem is access to the PC laboratory; an hour session for each of 100\nstudents makes significant inroads into bookable and open-access time. Scheduled classes\nfor software training should not be reduced to accommodate this activity. The problem\nmultiplies if other groups have similar activity at the same time. In time, however, as more\nand more students possess their own powerful PCs, access to tutorial software via\nnetwork or by disk distribution will enable them to participate while in their own personal\nenvironment, independent of the central facility.\nAt present, the tutorial system is not compact. Students work from a printed laboratory\nscript' and still need pencil and paper, not only for rough working but to make notes for\nlater reference in the laboratory and for retention. Hand-held calculators are much in\nevidence. Browsing is rather more difficult than with printed text as the computer-based\ntutorial is a focused sequential activity.\nA few rather more sophisticated word-processing and drawing facilities would be\nwelcomed in Authorware Professional, in particular an ability to draw arcs and sinewaves\nplus pixel-erase and pixel-edit (fatbits); subscripting with auto size reduction; and Greek\nsymbols such as Omega and Pi as options rather than in a different font.\nConclusion\nComputer-based tutorials have proved very successful in enticing students to prepare\nthemselves for laboratory work. Written to guide students through preliminary\ncalculations for an experiment, the tutorial reinforces understanding of the material and\nprovides on-line access to the recommended text. It is a self-paced exercise in which a\nstudent takes not more than one hour to become well-prepared for a six-hour laboratory\nsession, thus making far more productive use of that session. This activity is seen as an\nenhancement of paper-based study, not as an extra imposition. In some establishments it\nis felt necessary to pass a test before entering the laboratory; with the enthusiasm\ngenerated by the computer-based tutorial this will not be necessary.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors wish to thank Professor Greville Bloodworth of the University of York for\nhis enthusiastic and constructive contribution to this work.\nReference\nRitchie, G.J.
