Several reviews are \navailable [1-5]. Components produced by semi-solid processing have higher mechanical \nproperties and reduced porosity compared with conventional casting. The process depends on \nthe material behaving in a thixotropic way in the semisolid state i.e. flowing when sheared but \nthickening again when allowed to stand. This behaviour requires the microstructure to consist \n    - 2 - \nof spheroids of solid surrounded by a liquid matrix. When sheared, the bonds between the \nspheroids break down. On standing the spheroids reagglomerate. \n \nThixoforming is one branch of semi-solid processing. Feedstock material is prepared which, \nwhen it is heated into the semisolid state, gives a spheroidal microstructure. Thixoforming \ninvolves feedstock material which is initially in the solid state, in contrast with rheocasting \nwhere the spheroidal microstructure is obtained during the process without a solidification \nstep eg. by stirring during cooling from the liquid into the semisolid region. The preparation \nof the feedstock material for thixoforming introduces extra cost in comparison with casting. \nThere is therefore a drive to develop simple and effective routes to produce thixotropic \nmaterials. The rate of microstructural evolution in the semi-solid state during reheating then \ndetermines whether a material is suitable; extensive coarsening will have a deleterious effect \non final mechanical properties.  \n \nIn this paper, two routes were used to produce thixotropic material - recrystallisation and \npartial melting (RAP) [6] and cooling slope casting (CS) [7]. The former has already been \nused commercially for the production of components, the latter is part of the process called \nNew Rheocasting (NRC) [8,9] and indeed has wider potential applications [e.g. 10,11]. In the \nRAP route, material which has been worked, for example by extrusion, at temperatures below \nthe recrystallisation temperature, is then reheated into the semisolid state. Recrystallisation \noccurs and the first liquid to form tends to penetrate down the recrystallised boundaries, \nresulting in spheroids of solid in a liquid matrix, the ideal microstructure for thixoforming. \nThe RAP route is allied to the Strain Induced Melt Activated (SIMA) route [12] but in the \nSIMA route working takes place \u2018hot\u2019, i.e. above the recrystallisation temperature, and is \nfollowed by a period of cold work prior to reheating. In RAP the working is warm (i.e. below \nthe recrystallisation temperature). The advantages of the RAP route are that many aerospace \nalloys are supplied in the worked state and hence in a state ready for reheating and semisolid \nprocessing. In addition, the spheroids tend to be very well rounded in comparison with those \nproduced by liquid state routes to thixoformable microstructures (for example, \nmagnetohydrodynamic stirring) and hence give advantageous flow properties [13]. The main \ndisadvantage is that wider diameter billets are difficult to work and there may be \ninhomogeneity in the degree of work introduced across the component, leading to \ninhomogeneous spheroidal microstructure across the cross-section. \n \n    - 3 - \nIn the Cooling Slope route, liquid metal is poured onto a chilled slope. Copious nuclei are \ngenerated on the slope and a spheroidal structure can then be achieved in the mould. In the \nNRC process, the material is then fed directly to a shot sleeve without intermediate \nsolidification hence saving energy and enabling waste to be recycled within the plant itself. \nAlternatively, the material in the mould can be solidified and then reheated for thixoforming.  \nIn this paper, microstructural coarsening of semi-solid alloys produced by this route and by \nthe RAP route is analysed and compared with results from the literature. The rate of \nmicrostructural coarsening is important partly because semi-solid materials with a coarse \ngrain size do not deform as easily as those with a fine grain size [14] and also because the \nmechanical properties of the product are degraded if the grain size is larger. \n \nClassically, for low fractions of solid where the solid particles are well separated and non-\ninteracting, the LSW theory applies [15-17]. The driving force for coarsening in the semisolid \nstate is the reduction in interfacial free energy. The simple LSW analysis gives: \n \nKtdd =\u2212 30\n3                                            (1) \nwhere d  is the average particle diameter at time t , 0d  is the average particle diameter at time \n0=t  and K  is the coarsening rate constant. For higher fractions of solid where the particle \ndiffusion fields are interacting, Annavarapu and Doherty [18] proposed the liquid film \nmigration model. With this model the coarsening rate should increase as fraction solid \nincreases. However, experimental results [e.g. 19] for high fraction solid systems ( 7.0~>sf ) \nshow a decreasing coarsening rate with increasing fraction solid. Manson-Whitton et al. [19] \ntherefore developed a modified liquid film migration model to take into account the necks \nbetween the contacting solid particles. The form of the equation is still essentially as in (1). \nThe transition between the liquid film migration model due to Annavarapu and Doherty [18] \nand the modified liquid film migration model due to Manson Whitton et al. [19] occurs at \n7.0~sof for their experimental materials (spray-formed Al-4Cu and AA2618 alloys). \nManson-Whitton et al. suggest the transition value ( sof  ) will depend on the dihedral angle \nbetween two solid grains in contact with liquid. If wetting is difficult (large dihedral angle) \nthen the transition will occur at lower values of the fraction solid. Kim and Yoon [20] and \nBoettinger et al. [21] have observed that, at high sf , coarsening in Mo-Ni-Fe and Al-Sn \nalloys is controlled by diffusion through the liquid rather than by the solid-solid contacts, and \n    - 4 - \ngrain contacts tend to lead to a decrease in grain growth rates because of the reduced \nsolid\/liquid interfacial area. Manson-Whitton et al. [19] also discuss the inhibition of \ncoarsening by particles present at the grain boundary liquid films in order to account for \nslower rates of coarsening in alloy AA2618 than in Al-4wt.%Cu alloy. They propose two \npossible explanations for the sharp increase in coarsening rate for AA2618 when the fraction \nof solid decreases from 0.75 to 0.7. Firstly, Al9FeNi particles at the grain boundaries may be \ndissolving or melting on heating to the slightly higher temperature required for lower sf , thus \nunpinning the liquid film. Secondly, for sf <0.75, the Al9FeNi particles are becoming small \nrelative to the thickness of the liquid film and hence ineffective as pinning particles. De \nFreitas et al. [22] have compared coarsening in alloy 2024 with Al-4wt.%Cu in the semisolid \nstate and also discussed the retarding effect that intermetallics exert on particle growth. \n \nGrain coalescence is thought to play an important role. Tzimas and Zavaliangos [23] studied \nthe evolution of near-equiaxed microstructures in the semi-solid state, produced by spray \ncasting, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) casting and the stress induced, melt activated (SIMA) \nprocess. Ostwald ripening and grain coalescence were thought to operate simultaneously and \nindependently as soon as liquid is formed. Tzimas and Zavaliangos expected Ostwald \nripening to be dominant at longer times and at high volume fractions of liquid, while growth \nby coalescence by grain boundary migration is dominant at short times after liquid is formed, \nat low volume fractions of liquid.  \n \nHere we analyse coarsening in the semi-solid state for four different materials which when \nreheated into the semisolid state will have spheroidal microstructures: 2014 (a conventionally \nwrought alloy) produced by the RAP route; 2014 produced by the cooling slope route; a \nmodified 2014 (without the minor elements Fe, Mn and Zn and with relatively low silicon \ncontent) produced by the cooling slope route; and alloy 201 (a high strength casting alloy) \nproduced by the cooling slope route. The composition of alloy 201 is quite close to 2014 but \nits strength derives from the presence of silver, which is not present in the other alloys. The \nalloys have previously been thixoformed and the results presented [24, 25]. The results will be \ncompared with those for other cast and wrought alloys from the literature. \n \n2. Experimental procedure \n \n    - 5 - \nThe condition of starting materials is summarised in Table 1. The extruded 2014 was used for \nboth the RAP route and for remelting for the cooling slope route. The modified 2014 and the \n201 were both treated with the cooling slope. \n \nThe liquid fraction-temperature relationship was determined using differential scanning \ncalorimetry (DSC). Samples of about 3 mm diameter and 15 mg weight were cut, weighed \nand put into carbon pans with carbon lids in an argon atmosphere. The DSC tests were carried \nout using a Dupont 910 Differential Scanning Calorimeter. The samples were heated to 680\u00b0C \nat 10K\/min and cooled to room temperature at the same rate. The heat flow and temperature \nwere monitored by thermocouples to obtain heating and cooling curves. The fraction liquid \nvs. temperature curves were obtained by integrating under the curves.  \n \nIn the cooling slope casting route, as-received materials (as-extruded plus T6 2014, DC-cast \nmodified 2014 and DC-cast 201) were melted in a bonded alumina crucible in an induction \nfurnace and then cooled to 10~20 K above the liquidus temperature. This was followed by \nbottom pouring from the crucible onto a water-cooled slope and hence into a steel mould (50 \nmm in diameter and 150 mm in length). The mould was then quenched. A diagram of the \ncooling slope apparatus is given in [24] and further details in [26]. \n \nA salt bath furnace was used to study the microstructural evolution in the semisolid state. The \ntemperatures were originally chosen to give fractions of liquid suitable for, or approaching \nthose suitable for, thixoforming of each of the alloys concerned. It is therefore not the case \nthat the same liquid fraction has been used for each alloy. Nevertheless useful data on \ncoarsening coefficients for comparison with the literature can be obtained. \n \nSamples with dimensions 8 mm x 8 mm x 15 mm were cut from wrought extruded bar and \nfrom ingots cast with the cooling slope. A hole of 1.6 mm was drilled into the centre of each \nsample in order to insert a thermocouple for monitoring the temperature of the samples.   For \nthe RAP route, as-received extruded 2014 in the T6 heat treated state was heated in a salt bath \nto 625\u00b0C and soaked for 3, 5, 10 and 30 min before water quenching. Temperatures of 610 \nand 620\u00b0C and soaking times of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30 min were used for alloy 2014. A \ntemperature of 631\u00b0C was used for modified 2014 cooling slope ingot specimens and of \n620\u00b0C for alloy 201, with soaking times of 1, 3 and 5 min. The specimens were ground, \npolished and observed under an optical microscope and images taken. Quantitative \n    - 6 - \nmeasurements of the grain\/rosette size ( 2\/1)\/4( \u03c0Ad = , where A is area of rosette) were \ncarried out and the coarsening rate constants were calculated assuming the cubic power-law \nmodel (equation (1)). The term \u2018rosette\u2019 is used here to describe the microstructural features, \nwhich are generally not dendrites but are not fully rounded spheroids either. Some samples \nwere examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). \n \nMicrograph sequences for the isothermal holding in the semisolid state for the conditions \ngiven for extruded 2014 in T6 temper, cooling slope modified 2014 and cooling slope alloy \n201 have been presented in earlier work [24]. Here we focus on data for coarsening \ncoefficients which has not previously been presented. We will present micrographs for \ncooling slope 2014. The previous work [24] has shown the condition of the starting material \nin each case. In the as-received extruded 2014, which is in the T6 heat treated condition, the \ngrains are elongated in the extrusion direction. Some partially recrystallised grains were found \nlocated adjacent to coarse inclusions distributed longitudinally. The main intermetallic phases \npresent were identified as CuAl2 and (CuFeMn)3Si2Al15. The as-received DC cast \u2018modified\u2019 \n2014 and alloy 201 consisted of dendritic \u03b1-aluminium morphology with interdendritic \neutectic. After cooling slope casting, the \u2018modified\u2019 2014 is non-uniform, consisting of fine \nequiaxed dendrite cells in the centre of the ingot whilst the structure at the perimeter shows \nmore features within the cells. The microstructure for the 201 cooling slope ingots is \nrelatively uniform with fine equiaxed dendrite cells. \n \n3. Results  \n \n3.1 Liquid fraction versus temperature \n \nCurves for liquid fraction versus temperature derived from the DSC results are shown in Fig. \n1. The corresponding liquid fractions for the temperatures chosen for isothermal holding of \nthe specimens are shown in Table 2. \n \n \n3.2 Microstructural evolution during partial melting \n \n    - 7 - \nFig. 2 shows as-cast cooling slope ingot microstructure for 2014 and the structural evolution \nduring isothermal holding in the semisolid state at 610\u00b0C and 620\u00b0C. Fine dendrites in the \nstarting material transform into spheroids during the holding. Grain size measurement shows \na continuous increase of grain size as the soaking time increases. Grain size increases from 53 \nto 61 \u00b5m with increase in soaking time from 3 to 10 min at 610\u00b0C and from 51 to 84 \u00b5m with \nincrease in soaking time from 1 to 30 min at 620\u00b0C. The error on the grain size measurement \nis + 4 \u00b5m. Note that the liquid content apparent in the micrographs is not indicative of the \nquantity present at temperature because the quench is not sufficiently rapid for the liquid \ncontent to be entirely \u2018frozen in\u2019. During the quench, some liquid deposits onto the solid, \nappearing to be \u2018solid\u2019 in the quenched microstructure [23]. The other alloys show similar \nmicrostructural development with time at temperature in the semisolid region (see [24]). \n \n3.3 Coarsening during partial melting \n \nUsing the microstructural results for isothermal holding as presented in [24] and in section 3.2 \nabove, the grain sizes were analysed using equation (1). Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the \ncube of the average globule diameter 3d as a function of isothermal soaking time in the \nsemisolid state for alloy 2014, modified 2014 and alloy 201 with different initial \nmicrostructures. The intercept is the value of 30d . The amounts of liquid present are not \ndirectly comparable. However, the following comments can be made. Slower coarsening \nkinetics were shown by alloy 2014 made by either CS or RAP routes: the values of coarsening \nrate constant K are 173 \u00b5m3s-1 for RAP 2014 held at 625\u00b0C with 37% fL, and 192 \u00b5m3s-1 and \n255 \u00b5m3s-1 for CS 2014 held at 610\u00b0C with 17% fL and 620\u00b0C with 28% fL, respectively. \nLower coarsening rate (173 \u00b5m3s-1 at 625\u00b0C) was observed for the RAP route than for the CS \nroute (192 \u00b5m3s-1 at 610\u00b0C and 255 \u00b5m3s-1 at 620\u00b0C) and lower coarsening rate for the CS \nroute at the lower heating temperature with lower fraction liquid. Compared with alloy 2014, \nrelatively faster coarsening kinetics were shown by modified alloy 2014 and alloy 201 made \nby CS: the values of coarsening rate constant K are 1384 \u00b5m3s-1 for modified alloy 2014 held \nat 631\u00b0C with 45% fL and 2157 \u00b5m3s-1 for alloy 201 held at 620\u00b0C with 20% fL. Here, more \nformally, the coarsening rate figures cannot be quoted to this precision and should be rounded \nto 170, 190, 260, 1400 and 2200 \u00b5m3s-1 respectively.  \n \n    - 8 - \nCoarsening rate thus appears to be related to the initial microstructure, i.e. RAP or CS, and to \nthe alloy composition. For example, for a similar initial microstructure from cooling slope \ncasting, a higher coarsening rate constant was observed for modified alloy 2014 and alloy 201 \nthan for unmodified alloy 2014.  \n \n3.4 Liquid entrapped in the primary phase \n \nThe microstructure presented in Fig. 4 shows clearly that some liquid pockets are present \nwithin the primary phase in modified alloy 2014 after soaking for 5 min at 631\u00b0C. In grain A, \na large liquid droplet (indicated by arrow B) is apparently about to detach itself from the \nboundary and another one (indicated by arrow C) is going to form from the liquid on the grain \nboundary. Note examples of liquid in the process of penetrating down boundaries.  \n \n \n4. Discussion \n \n4.1 Dendrite Arm Coalescence in the Early Stages for Cooling Slope Material \n \nFine dendritic microstructures were obtained by CS casting with low superheating (see Fig. \n2a). During partial melting and subsequent soaking in the semi-solid state, coarsening first \nproceeds predominantly through coalescence of dendrite arms (Fig. 4). As dendrite arms of \nthe same grain have perfectly matching crystallographic orientations, this dendrite arm \ncoalescence is expected to be extremely rapid. As long as the grains are not fully globular, \ncoalescence will lead to an increase of the mean free path in the solid phase (i.e. an atom \ncould diffuse further within a globule without encountering a barrier) but the number of grains \nwill remain constant (i.e. no Ostwald ripening) until, eventually, the solid phase becomes \nglobular [27]. After coalescence, phase coarsening will take place through the dissolution of \nthe small globules and the grain number will then decrease [27].  \n \nIn the alloys examined here, coalescence is having a relatively minor effect on the coarsening \nrate after the very initial stages. Comparing Fig. 2 (a) with Fig. 2 (b), for the very early stages \nof holding at 610\u00b0C, essentially coalescence of the short dendrite arms in the equiaxed cells in \nthe CS material has occurred by 3 min., giving globule sizes which are similar to the original \ncell sizes in the starting material. From that point, the mechanisms (and indeed coarsening \n    - 9 - \nrate) are very similar for CS 2014 and RAP 2014 (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the findings \nin [23]. \n \n4.2 Effects of Alloy Composition on Coarsening \n \nCS cast 2014 exhibits a lower coarsening rate constant (192 and 255 \u00b5m3\/s at 610 and 620\u00b0C) \nthan CS cast modified 2014 (1384 \u00b5m3\/s) and alloy 201 (2157 \u00b5m3\/s). These alloys have \nsimilar copper contents (3.91, 3.87 and 4.35 wt% for alloy 2014, modified 2014 and 201, \nrespectively). The significant difference in the coarsening rate constant must be attributed to \nthe presence of secondary phases in alloy 2014. CuAl2 particles are responsible for the \nprecipitation hardening capacity, tend to be sub-micron in size and will tend to dissolve below \nthe solidus. In contrast, the insoluble Fe, Mn-containing particles will be present in the semi-\nsolid state and are of a size where they can potentially obstruct the migration of the liquid \nboundary, either through a pinning type mechanism or through inhibiting diffusion through \nthe liquid from one boundary position to another [18]. The results are essentially consistent \nwith the observations in [19-22] about the inhibiting effect of second phase particles. In \nmodified alloy 2014, minor elements such as Fe, Mn, Si, which form insoluble intermetallic \nphases, have been stripped out and the coarsening is much faster.  \n \nFig. 5 shows a compilation of results from this work and from the literature, plotting \ncoarsening coefficient against temperature. This is the most comprehensive collection of the \ndata up until now. Fig. 6 is a magnified view of the 0-650 x 10-18m3\/s range in K in Fig. 5.  \nThere is a general trend for increase in K with increase in temperature in Fig. 6. However, \nscientifically K relates not only to temperature (since diffusion is faster at higher temperature) \nbut also to fraction liquid (since liquid provides a much faster diffusion path than solid and \nonce a continuous liquid path is present around the spheroids coarsening can accelerate). Fig. \n7, therefore, plots the data for Al-4Cu alloys and Al-6.7Cu versus fraction liquid rather than \ntemperature. Fig. 8 shows the coarsening coefficient for 2000 series alloys (and one 7000 \nseries alloy) versus fraction liquid. \n \nThe majority of the results in Fig. 6 are for wrought composition alloys (AA2014, 2014, \nA2017, 2618, AA2618, 6061, 7075, AA7034) which are likely to have minority phase \nparticles present (such as those based on Fe). The exceptions are circled. The AlCu4.5Mg1.5 \n    - 10 - \n[18] (short solid blue lines) is DC-cast with a grain refiner. Annavarapu and Doherty [18] \nargue that the slow coarsening rate for this material is due to the Ti-rich grain refining \nparticles inhibiting grain boundary migration. For the chill cast Al6.7Cu (open red diamonds), \nAnnavarapu and Doherty [18] suggest that the strongly inhibited coarsening is in line with \ntheory, in that during the last stages of solidification there will be large scale coalescence of \nadjacent dendrite arms with the same orientation. This leads to the formation of trapped liquid \npockets within the grains, terminating the rapid coarsening. The results for spray-formed Al-\n4Cu [28] are more of a puzzle. Fig. 5 shows three sets of results for spray-formed Al-4Cu: \nthose due to Grant et al. [28] (open pink squares); those due to Hee Soo Kim [29] (open blue \ncircles); and those due to Manson-Whitton et al. [19] (open pink triangles). The latter two sets \nof results both give coarsening rates above the 650 x 10-18m3\/s upper bound for Fig. 6. \nAnnavarapu and Doherty [18] suggest that, in general, spray forming will tend to give low \ncoarsening coefficients because of drag on liquid film migration (at high fractions of solid) by \nminority second phase particles - solid or gas. Since the alloy for the three sets of results is \nrelatively clean Al-4Cu in each case, this suggests there must be some difference in the \nspraying conditions which is potentially leading to gas incorporation in the materials for the \nstudy reported in [28] in comparison with  [29] and [19]. This surmise is supported by private \ncommunication [36] which indicates that the material for [28] was prepared in a relatively \nsmall sprayforming batch on University scale equipment whereas that for [19,29] was \nprepared on commercial equipment in a large billet. There are likely to have been differences \nin the percentage of porosity in the two types of material, with perhaps 1-3% porosity in the \nformer as opposed to 0.5-1.5% in the latter.  \n \nThe SIMA Al-4Cu [33] (solid pink dashes) contains a grain refiner which is likely to give rise \nto particles which inhibit boundary migration as discussed above. The AlSi7Mg0.6 [27] (solid \nbrown square) is prepared by the SIMA route. Inspection of the composition data shows that \nit includes 0.13wt% Ti which may again be inhibiting boundary migration. \n \nFor the results in Fig. 5 which are higher than 650 x 10-18m3\/s, other than those from [19,29] \nfor spray-formed Al-4Cu, two points are for material in this study which does not contain \nelements likely to form particles inhibiting boundary motion (201 produced with the cooling \nslope (blue cross) [25 and this work] and \u2018modified\u2019 2014 which has had all the minority \nparticle forming elements \u2018stripped out\u2019 (open black triangle) [25 and this work]). There are \ntwo results from ref [30] which should be compared. The dark blue star is for 6061 prepared \n    - 11 - \nby the RAP route. This should be compared with the solid green line which is for 6061 which \nhas had the Mn and Cr stripped out. The coarsening coefficient is then significantly higher. \nPitts suggests that this is due to the removal of Mn and Cr based insoluble intermetallics [30]. \nNote that the data in [30] has been re-examined for this work and the coarsening coefficient \nrecalculated. The pink cross is for DC cast AlCu4.5Mg1.5 from Annavarapu and Doherty [18] \n(pink cross). They argue that the relatively high coarsening rate is due to dendrite arm \ncoalescence. The diagonal red cross [35] and solid green circle [34] are both for MHD cast \nalloys with classic cast compositions. The result for DC cast AlSi7Mg0.6 from Lou\u00e9 and \nSuery [27] (solid brown diamond) is higher than that for the same material prepared by the \nSIMA route (solid brown square). Lou\u00e9 and Suery suggest that this is associated with a higher \ncontribution to coarsening from coalescence in the DC cast material. However, there is some \nevidence that in SIMA material the texture of neighbouring globules is, to some extent, \n\u2018inherited\u2019 from the same extruded grain (as is demonstrated in [37]) making coalescence \nrelatively easy. This issue is yet to be resolved. \n \nOverall, the range of results for coarsening coefficient can be rationalised essentially in terms \nof the presence, or otherwise, of agents which are pinning grain boundaries or interfering with \ndiffusion through liquid along grain boundaries. These agents include: insoluble intermetallics \nbased around elements such as Fe, Mn, Cr; porosity or; grain refining species such as those \nbased on Ti.  \n \n4.3 The Effects of Liquid Fraction on Coarsening Rate \n \nAlthough in this study we have not obtained coarsening coefficients for a range of liquid \nfractions (there are two liquid fractions for CS 2014 but for the other alloys only one) we will \nexamine here the data from the literature on variation with liquid fraction to check whether \nour data are consistent with results which have been obtained previously.  \n \nFig. 7 shows the coarsening coefficient (K) vs. fraction liquid, assuming equation (1) applies, \nfor Al-Cu alloys. The data from [19] for spray-formed Al-4Cu show an increase in K up to \nabout 25% fraction liquid, followed by a decrease. The other data sets do not cover such a \nwide range of liquid fractions. The two points from Hee Soo Kim [29] are essentially \nconsistent with the data for low liquid fractions (20%) from Manson-Whitton et al. [19]. \nThere are two points from Grant et al. [28] which are for low fractions liquid (about 5% and \n    - 12 - \n10%). These show lower coarsening rates than Manson-Whitton et al. [19] and the possible \nreasons for this, in terms of spray forming conditions, have been discussed above. Data from \nFerrante and de Freitas [33] are essentially linear spanning about 15% fraction liquid through \nto about 40%. These points are for SIMA Al-4Cu with grain refiner. There is just slight \nevidence that the points might follow a similar trend to the Manson-Whitton et al. data with a \npeak around 30% fraction liquid. The regression coefficient for the linear fit is relatively low \nat 85.02 =R . The linear fit is, however, relatively good for the results from Annavarapu and \nDoherty [18] for Al-6.7Cu. The Manson Whitton et al. theory therefore requires further \nconfirmation by experiments with a wide range of liquid fractions and with materials with \nvarying dihedral angles for liquid in contact with solid.  \n \nIn Fig. 8, results from this study are plotted alongside results for other wrought alloy \ncompositions (in summary 2014 alloys (spray cast, SIMA, CS), 2618 (spray formed), \nAA7034 (spray formed)). It is only in the Manson Whitton et al. study for 2618 [19] that there \nis evidence of a sharp increase in coarsening coefficient between 25 and 30% liquid. As \ncommented in the Introduction, Manson Whitton et al. account for this by suggesting that, \neither the particles which are inhibiting boundary movement are dissolving\/melting as the \ntemperature increases, or they may be becoming small relative to the thickness of the liquid \nfilm. There is some suggestion of non-linear behaviour for the results for spray formed \nAA7034 [29].  The data from Annavarapu and Doherty [18] for spray cast AA2014 are \nessentially linear. There are only two points for the CS 2014 from this study and therefore it is \ndifficult to draw conclusions about the effect of liquid fraction variation, although the data are \nclose to those for AA2014 produced by spray casting [18]. The data point from this study for \nmodified 2014 (with elements which might produce pinning intermetallics stripped out) \nproduced with the cooling slope would be off the top of the graph (45% liquid giving a \ncoarsening coefficient of 2157 \u03bcm3\/s). The result for RAP 2014 from this study (173 \u03bcm3\/s \nfor 37% liquid) is close to the Hee Soo Kim results [29] for a different alloy. Again there is a \nneed for further studies at a range of liquid fractions to examine whether the phenomenon of \n\u2018unpinning\u2019, demonstrated in the Manson-Whitton et al. [19] results at a certain liquid \nfraction, occurs in other alloys but perhaps at different liquid fractions. It may be that 2014 is \nmuch more resistant to such a phenomenon as the Fe based intermetallics are essentially \ninsoluble. If, at high liquid fractions, no such \u2018unpinning\u2019 is observed, this supports the first \nManson-Whitton hypothesis (i.e. dissolution\/melting of particles in 2618), as the second \n    - 13 - \nhypothesis (pinning particles becoming small relative to the thickness of the liquid film) \nwould not be alloy sensitive.  \n \n4.4 Implications for Thixoforming \n \nIn thixoforming, material is heated into the semi-solid state and held until an isothermal \ntemperature profile is achieved, before forcing the material into the die. If the coarsening \ncoefficient is relatively high, the time in the semi-solid state must be absolutely minimised in \norder to avoid coarse microstructures with poor capacity to flow into thin sections (compare \nparticle sizes of 150-200\u03bcm with potential component wall thicknesses of 1mm). In addition, \ncoarse microstructures will tend to have poor mechanical strength. Processing windows may \nbe a little less stringent for the alloys such as those based on the wrought compositions, which \ngive relatively low coarsening rates. However, it should be noted that these alloys are \ninherently difficult to thixoform for other reasons [24,37].   \n \n \n5. Conclusions \nTwo potential routes to suitable starting material for thixoforming are recrystallisation and \npartial melting (RAP) and cooling slope (CS). Here the microstructural coarsening of such \nmaterials in the semi-solid state has been analysed. \n \nA lower coarsening rate was observed for RAP route 2014 alloy (coarsening rate K=173 \n\u00b5m3s-1 at 625\u00b0C with 37% fraction liquid) than for CS route 2014 alloy (coarsening rate \nK=192 \u00b5m3s-1 at 610\u00b0C with 17% fraction liquid) despite the higher fraction liquid for the \nformer.  For the CS route, an increase in fraction liquid gave a higher coarsening rate, \n(coarsening rate K=192 \u00b5m3s-1 at 610\u00b0C with 17% fraction liquid and 255 \u00b5m3s-1 at 620\u00b0C \nwith 28% fraction liquid). A relatively high coarsening rate was observed in a modified 2014 \nalloy with the Fe, Mn and Zn stripped out of the composition and a relatively low Si content \n(K=2157 \u00b5m3s-1 at 631\u00b0C with 45% fraction liquid). The coarsening rate was also relatively \nhigh for alloy 201 prepared by the CS route (K=1384 \u00b5m3s-1 at 620\u00b0C with 20% fraction \nliquid) compared with alloy 2014 either by RAP or CS. \n \n    - 14 - \nIn the literature, dendrite arm coalescence is discussed as potentially contributing to \ncoarsening. Here, this mechanism is having a relatively minor effect after the very initial \nstages for Cooling Slope material. CS cast 2014 exhibits a lower coarsening rate constant than \nCS cast modified 2014 and alloy 201. This is attributed to the presence of secondary phases in \nthe 2014, which are pinning the liquid boundary migration. The particles must be resistant to \ndissolution and are likely to be the insoluble Fe, Mn-based intermetallics. These findings \nsupport observations in the literature about the role of second phase particles. \n \nCompilation and analysis of data from the literature further supports the argument that those \nalloys which give relatively low coarsening coefficients contain agents of some form which \nwill pin the liquid film grain boundaries (insoluble intermetallics based around elements such \nas Fe, Mn, Cr, porosity, grain refining species such as those based on Ti). Thus, wrought alloy \ncompositions tend to give relatively low coarsening coefficients, as do alloys which contain \ngrain refiner.  \n  \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC Grant GR\/M89096) and the University of Leicester for financial support. \nThe University of Sheffield provided experimental facilities.
