Between\n2004 and 2006, the National Institute of Malariology,\nParasitology and Entomology of Vietnam, in collabora-\ntion with the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium\nand with the financial support of the Belgium Coopera-\ntion and the UBS Optimus Foundation, piloted a cluster-\nbased randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of long-\nlasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) for the control of\nforest malaria in the province of Ninh Thuan. Ten inter-\nvention clusters received free LLIHs and were followed\nover two years, together with 10 control clusters (total\n20,000 inhabitants), using bi-annual malariometric sur-\nveys and passive case detection. The latter was carried out\nat Commune Health Centres (CHC) and at the homes of\nvillage health workers (VHW) who were trained in the use\nof rapid diagnostic tests and malaria treatment. An ancil-\nlary health economic study was set up to evaluate the cost-\neffectiveness of this new intervention. This paper presents\nan estimation of the economic costs of a malaria episode\nto households in this area. The full economic cost and rel-\native cost-effectiveness of LLIHs will be addressed in a\nsubsequent paper.\nMethods\nStudy area and population\nThe study was carried out in two districts (Bac Ai and Ninh\nSon) in the northwest of Ninh Thuan Province. The area\nis inhabited primarily by the Raglay ethnic minority, a\nlargely self-sustaining farming community. Malaria trans-\nmission in this area is perennial with two peaks, at the\nbeginning and end of the rainy season (May and Novem-\nber) [7]. Over the past few decades, the Vietnamese gov-\nernment has tried to relocate the Raglay community away\nfrom the forests and into purpose-built villages contain-\ning basic infrastructure. However, Raglays, a traditionally\nnomadic minority, continue to frequent the forest for cul-\ntivation and various other daily activities, and thus are\ncontinuously exposed to forest-dwelling mosquitoes.\nIll patients have the option of seeking care from the VHW\nwho can do a rapid diagnostic test (Paramax 3\u00ae, Zephyr\nBiomedicals, India) and, if positive, treat patients or refer\nthem to the CHC. Alternatively, patients can go for treat-\nment directly to the CHC where antimalarial drugs are\nprovided free by the government due to the poverty in the\narea. In another study, the treatment seeking patterns for\nmalaria within this population were estimated to be 60%\nat the VHW, 38% at the CHC and 2% at other facilities [8].\nSevere malaria cases are referred to the district or provin-\ncial hospital, where care is also free to the patient. The\nstudy area covers 30 villages (each with a VHW working\nfrom home) which make up 10 official communes (each\nwith a CHC), two District Health Centres (DHC), and one\ndistrict hospital.\nMethodology\nData on direct and indirect costs of malaria to the house-\nhold were collected by health workers using an exit survey\nand a household survey. The surveys were piloted for two\nmonths and then carried out between October 2004 and\nMarch 2006. Supervision for both surveys was provided\nby members of the provincial and national Malaria Con-\ntrol Programme, who also conducted refresher sessions\nregarding quality of responses and met regularly with data\ncollectors to ensure that study guidelines were adequately\nfollowed.\nPatients for the exit survey were identified at the CHC after\nhaving tested positive for malaria (using a rapid diagnos-\ntic test that detects all four human malaria species). Only\npatients with a positive test were asked to take part.\nPatients were asked about all direct costs they incurred,\nincluding all expenditures associated with seeking treat-\nment as well as all non-medical costs such as transport\ncosts. Household visits took place two to four weeks after\nthe initial interview at the CHC. The household survey\nincluded further questions regarding cost of any initial or\nfollow-up treatment for malaria, productive activities,\nhousehold assets, and workdays missed due to malaria.\nAll patients included in the study were given an individual\ncode number to maintain confidentiality.\nDirect costs were calculated per patient per facility and\nthen complemented by actual (non-trial) local treatment-\nseeking probabilities at each level in order to estimate the\nprobability-weighted mean direct cost per episode within\nthe community. The availability of free government-spon-\nsored malaria treatment was confirmed both in the survey\nand through informal discussions with patients, providers\nand provincial health staff.\nIndirect costs refer to the productivity lost within the\nhousehold due to illness. Following the broad interpreta-\ntion of the human capital approach [9], these costs\ninclude: reduced paid production due to the individual's\ndisease, reduced unpaid production due to the individ-\nual's disease, and indirect costs accrued by the family for\ntaking care of the individual during their illness. The pro-\nductivity loss within the household translates to an\nincome loss that can be calculated using various micro-\neconomic tools. Output-based approaches value the prod-\nuct forgone within the loss of time until the person is\nreplaced or recovers [10]. They attach zero value to unpaid\nhousework (primarily due to the difficulty of making\naccurate estimates of its output). Opportunity cost\napproaches use average wages paid to local workers as\nproxies for the value of work of unpaid workers[9]. As the\nmain profession in the study area was subsistence farm-\ning, formally-paid wages were not available to act as prox-\nies for unpaid work. An output-based approach wasPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMalaria Journal 2008, 7:166 http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/166therefore chosen to measure productivity loss due to\nmalaria. In using this approach, income and production\nwere taken to be expressions of the same quantity: the\nvalue-added of productive persons or their contribution\nto overall wealth [11]. All agricultural work was consid-\nered to contribute to income whether the products were\neventually sold or consumed within the household.\nIt was judged that questions concerning loss of productiv-\nity due to illness would not attract accurate responses.\nTherefore, the household survey collected data on yearly\nhousehold production (of livestock and agricultural pro-\nduce) which was valued using the price of each item on\nthe local market and taken to be a proxy for yearly\nincome. Responses about local prices of agricultural pro-\nduce and livestock varied little (average 22% deviation\nfrom the mean) so they were considered sufficiently accu-\nrate. These values were then complemented by evidence\non productive days per year, work time, division of work\nwithin the family, and likelihood of being replaced when\nill, in order to calculate the average daily household\nincome per person.\nAnthropological investigation associated with the study\npreviously found that men and women work the same\nhours and with the same intensity in the fields and that\nchildren over the age of 10 are fully contributing members\nof the household. Their contribution to output was there-\nfore given equal value. This investigation also found that\nthis community works approximately six days per week\nthroughout the rainy season, which corresponds to\napproximately half the year. Assuming that these families\nwork only four days per week during the dry season when\nthere is less to cultivate, the average number of household\nproductive workdays per year is 261. Workday equivalents\nfor working time lost were calculated assuming responses\nexpressed in days equalled one workday and responses\nexpressed in hours and minutes equalled a fraction of a\n12-hour workday. Given the stated average number of\nworkdays lost for the patient and carer, the average\nincome loss per malaria episode could then be calculated\nper household.\nIndirect and direct costs were combined to estimate the\ntotal cost incurred by the household per episode. Costs\nwere converted from Vietnamese Dong (VND) to US dol-\nlars (USD) using the average inter-bank exchange rate for\nthe period in which the study was conducted (15,989\nVND per USD) [12]. Data entry, cleaning, and analysis\nwere done with Epi-Info6 and Microsoft Excel. Sensitivity\nanalysis was carried out to account for uncertainty sur-\nrounding some of the data and to test results given differ-\ning conditions and assumptions. Individual data values\nconsidered uncertain were replaced with alternate values\nin order to observe the level of change in the study results.\nResults\nCharacteristics of study respondents\nFor the household survey, 251 patients were interviewed,\nwith a sex ratio male to female of 1.67. The median age\nwas 16, ranging from 1 to 68 years old and was similar\namong men (16.5 [range 1\u201368] and women (15 [range 1\u2013\n60]). Seventy-five patients (30%) were children under the\nage of 10 who are considered here to be too young to con-\ntribute significantly to household production. This pro-\nportion was the same as in the general population [7] and\nslightly lower than the symptomatic population of which\nunder 10s made up 36% of the population. Ninety-four\npercent of households sold agricultural products, 89%\nsold animals, and 3% worked for the public authority.\nThirteen percent claimed to also do other unspecified\nwork. Salaried workers had an annual average salary of\n5,232,000 VND or 327 USD (range 63 to 438 USD). Sev-\nenty-two percent of patients had a radio in their house-\nhold, 58% a television, 80% a bicycle, and 36% a\nmotorbike.\nDirect costs of a malaria episode to the household\nDirect costs associated with seeking treatment are\nreported in Table 1. Forty percent of the patients (n = 99)\nattended the CHC by bicycle, another 33% by motorbike\n(n = 84), and 27% (n = 67) on foot. Overall, patients\nincurred an average travel cost of 1,750 VND or 0.11 USD\nwhen seeking care at the commune level. Eight (3.2%)\npatients visited the CHC twice, but only four were treated\nfor malaria during the first visit. Four (1.6%) patients in\nthe study initially sought care from the VHW (prior to\nTable 1: Mean direct costs (USD) per malaria episode\nTravel* Treatment* Proportion of actual (non-trial) visits**\nHealth facility (% of trial population attendance)\nVillage Health Worker (1.6%) 0.08 0.97 60%\nCommunity Health Centre (100%) 0.11 0.00 38%\nOther treatment facility \u2013 hospital, private clinic, dispensary (3.2%) 0.96 0.19 2%\nMean total direct costs per episode under non-trial conditions 0.69 USD\n*Data from survey of patients attending CHC\n** Data from large passive case detection study[8]Page 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMalaria Journal 2008, 7:166 http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/166going to the CHC), paying a mean of 15,500 VND or 0.97\nUSD for treatment (range 0.38 to 1.63). It was not deter-\nmined whether treatment costs were for consultation or\ndrugs other than antimalarials. The mean travel cost for\nthose visiting the VHW was 1,250 VND or 0.08 USD.\nEight (3.2%) patients sought further treatment after\nattending the CHC: four went to hospital, three went to a\nprivate health clinic (possibly meaning a traditional\nhealer) and one went to a pharmacy\/drug seller. They paid\nan average of 3,000 VND or 0.19 USD for treatment with\nan average travel cost of 15,312 VND or 0.96 USD. If these\ndirect costs are applied to the actual treatment-seeking\npatterns for malaria in the community, where 60% of vis-\nits take place at the VHW, 38% at the CHC and 2% at\nother facilities[8], patients can be estimated to incur a\ndirect cost of 0.69 USD (Table 1).\nIndirect costs of a malaria episode to the household\nTime loss due to treatment seeking. Average travel time\nwas 14 minutes to the home of the VHW, 25 minutes to\nthe CHC, and 38 minutes to other facilities (hospital, pri-\nvate clinic, pharmacy\/drug seller). Average time spent at\nthe health facility was 25 minutes at the VHW's home, 2\nhours and 52 minutes at the CHC, and 1.77 workdays at\nother facilities. It was assumed that time lost from seeking\ntreatment was included in the patient's response for the\ntotal duration of illness. If time lost for treatment-seeking\nof the survey population is applied to the actual treat-\nment-seeking patterns of the community, patients, on\naverage, lose the equivalent of 0.14 workdays in seeking\ntreatment. Details of the time loss due to seeking treat-\nment are reported as workday equivalents in Table 2.\nPatients were accompanied by an average of 1.11 house-\nhold members (range:1\u20132). The household member\nstayed with the patient the entire duration of the visit and\ntherefore could not replace the patient in the field during\nthis time.\nTime loss due to illness\nThe average malaria episode was found to last approxi-\nmately 5 days (range: 1\u201310 days) \u2013 a duration over which\nmost patients ceased all work. For those few who did work\nwhile ill, the vast majority stated that they were not able\nto perform at a normal level. Almost all patients received\ncare from another household member. The caretaker was\nusually from the same household as the patient and\nceased to work for most of the time the patient was ill.\nProductivity and income loss\nThe surveys, together with numerous informal discussions\nwith community members, suggested farming to be the\nprimary economic activity in the area (see Table 3 for\ndetails). Livestock reared and sold in the area included pri-\nmarily chickens, cows, and pigs. Households grew a mean\nof 3.1 million VND or 194 USD worth of agricultural pro-\nduce per year of which they sold 2.4 million VND or 152\nUSD worth (79%). Households reared an average of 14\nmillion VND or 869 USD worth of livestock per year of\nwhich they sold 3.4 million VND or 210 USD (24%). Rev-\nenue from the sales could be spent on goods the house-\nhold itself did not produce. Interviews with village elders\nsuggested that the larger livestock were sold when house-\nholds struggled to find cash for meeting immediate needs\nlike seeking health care. 50% of households reared one or\nmore cows and 3% reared one or more buffaloes. Total\nyearly production per household \u2013 including both what\nwas sold and what was consumed \u2013 was estimated to be\n1063 USD.\nA loss of five full household productive workdays as a\nresult of malaria (approximately 2% of the estimated 261\ntotal household productive days) would result in a loss of\napproximately 325,629 VND or 20.37 USD in income.\nThis is 2% of the value of yearly production. However, not\nall productive members of the household are incapaci-\ntated during an episode of malaria. It was assumed, based\non local information, that each household had an average\nof three fully productive person equivalents (individuals\nbetween the ages of 10 and 65). As caretakers were found\nto be productively inactive for the duration of illness, two\nproductive person equivalents were considered inactive in\nthe case of malaria in a productive person and one pro-\nductive person equivalent was considered inactive in the\ncase of a non-productive person (aged 0 through 9 or over\n65) with malaria. It can be assumed that these days are\nproductive days as malaria usually coincides with the\nrainy season which is also an agriculturally productive\nseason. An episode of malaria amongst productive mem-\nbers of the household is therefore estimated to represent a\nTable 2: Mean time loss (workday equivalents) from treatment-seeking per malaria episode\nHealth facility (% of trial population attendance) Travel* Treatment* Proportion of actual (non-trial) visits **\nVillage Health Worker (1.6%) 0.02 0.03 60%\nCommunity Health Centre (100%) 0.03 0.16 38%\nSecondary treatment \u2013 hospital, private clinic, dispensary (3.2%) 0.05 0.77 2%\nMean workday equivalents lost per episode under non-trial conditions 0.14\n*Data from survey of patients attending CHC\n** Data from large passive case detection study[8]Page 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMalaria Journal 2008, 7:166 http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/166loss of two-thirds of this income (217,086 VND or 13.58\nUSD) and an episode amongst non-productive members\nis estimated to represent a loss of one-third of this income\n(108,543 VND or 6.79 USD). The mean weighted by age\nfor all symptomatic cases in the study area was 177,501\nVND, or 11.10 USD.\nSensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis was conducted on the duration of ill-\nness using the ranges provided in patient responses. At the\nlow end, a one-day episode would result in a loss of 2.22\nUSD in revenue per age weighted episode. At the high\nend, a 10-day episode would result in a loss of 22.20 USD\nin revenue per age weighted episode.\nThe number of productive household members was also\nsubject to sensitivity analysis to see how smaller or larger\nhouseholds might fare differently. A household with only\ntwo productive members would incur a loss of income of\n16.65 USD per age weighted episode. A household with 4\nproductive members would incur a loss of income of 8.33\nUSD per age weighted episode.\nA sensitivity analysis was also conducted on travel costs. If\nthe new VHW programme were to be cancelled and the\nCHC were the first level of care for those who currently go\nto the VHW, the average cost of travel would increase by\napproximately 15%. However, other costs which this\nstudy did not accurately calculate would likely increase\nsignificantly (see Discussion).\nThis study has examined the economic burden (propor-\ntion of household income lost directly or indirectly due to\nillness) caused by malaria. Depending on the context,\nburden is thought to be catastrophic when households are\nforced to cut their consumption of other minimum needs,\nsell productive assets, accrue large debt, or become impov-\nerished [13]. It has been suggested that this occurs when\nthe burden exceeds 10% of annual household income\n[14]. In this study, the burden of one episode of malaria\nis estimated to be 1.04% of annual household income on\naverage. This is calculated using number of productive\ndays lost out of total productive days so it does not change\naccording to household assets. However, it must be\nemphasized that this estimated loss in income is per epi-\nsode. If there are several episodes per household per year\nthe burden on the household could be substantially more.\nPrevious studies carried out in the nearby province of\nBinh Thuan estimated the entomological inoculation rate\nto be approximately 1 infective bite per person per year\nand the incidence of all malaria infections to be 0.44 per\nperson\/year[15,16]. Therefore, if there were to be on aver-\nage between 0.5 to 1 malaria episode per person per year,\nthen a family of five with two children under 10 would\nincur a cost of 27.15 to 54.31 USD or 3 to 5% of annual\nincome.\nDiscussion\nImpact on the household\nDirect costs per episode were estimated to be 0.69 USD,\nand indirect costs 11.10 USD, making a total of 11.79\nTable 3: Mean annual agricultural and livestock assets and sales per household\nCrop Mean household \nproduction\/year (kg)\nProportion sold\/year Local value \n(USD per kg)\nTotal value produced \n(USD)\nTotal value sold \n(USD)\nRice 435 64% 0.13 59.09 35.21\nMaize 586 86% 0.10 55.76 47.98\nCashews 102 98% 0.60 61.62 60.41\nCassava 442 40% 0.05 21.45 8.64\nTotal 193.83 152.23\nLivestock Mean owned\/\nhousehold\nSold\/year Local value \n(USD per unit)\nTotal value owned \n(USD)\nTotal value sold \n(USD)\nChicken 8.3 3.30 2.13 17.65 7.02\nCow 3.0 0.70 250.17 750.52 175.12\nBuffalo 0.2 0.04 250.17 50.03 10.01\nPig 1.8 0.70 24.27 43.68 16.99\nDuck 0.5 0.10 1.94 0.97 0.19\nGoat 0.1 0.02 45.34 4.53 0.91\nDog 0.2 0.02 9.38 1.88 0.19\nTotal 869.26 210.42Page 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMalaria Journal 2008, 7:166 http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/166USD. Thus the impact of malaria on the household was\nmainly in terms of the indirect costs (measured as an\nassumed reduction in output) imposed on an already\nsmall income. Mean annual household income was esti-\nmated to be worth 1063 USD, which is equivalent to\napproximately 4.25 cows on the local market. The approx-\nimate total loss of 11.79 USD per household per episode\nof malaria should be seen in the light of this yearly\nincome; for a household with no large saleable assets\n(cows or buffalo), the absolute burden of illness would be\nfar more significant than for those with these assets.\nFindings from a different study that was conducted on\ndata from all provinces in Vietnam suggested that a 60%\naverage reduction in malaria nationwide was associated\nwith a 1.8% increase in annual household consumption.\nThis translated to a mean 12.60 USD (1998 prices or\n15.10 USD in 2005 prices). It is difficult to directly com-\npare these findings with this study's findings due to the\nparticular epidemiological and economic conditions of\nthe south-central part of the country, as well as the differ-\nent methods used. The nationwide study included house-\nholds that did not experience any episodes of malaria,\nwhich could generally suggest that the estimated loss from\nmalaria in this study, which only included households\nthat experienced malaria episodes, may be low. However,\nthe direct costs in Ninh Thuan province, where this study\nwas conducted, are highly subsidized by government and\ntherefore not comparable to a country-wide sample. A\nstudy from Sri Lanka estimated the loss of annual house-\nhold income due to malaria to be 6% using wage rates[17]\ncompared to this study's estimate of 3 to 5% loss using\nproductivity losses.\nInformal interviews conducted in this study revealed that\nhouseholds in Ninh Thuan sold productive assets such as\na cow when under financial strain. It is difficult to esti-\nmate how many of the sales reported in the study took\nplace under catastrophic conditions and what proportion\nof household income was lost to require the selling of\nthese assets. Nor is it known what market conditions were\nlike, and whether sales due to the need to obtain cash were\nat times when market prices were depressed (which\nmight, for example, be the case if illness requiring sale of\nassets was concentrated at certain times of the year). It can,\nhowever, be inferred that those with large livestock to sell\nhad a much easier time meeting emergency cash needs in\ntimes of illness.\nProductivity loss was measured in terms of annual output\npotentially lost from missing a given number of produc-\ntive workdays due to illness. However, there may be com-\npensating mechanisms (such as to adjustments to worker\nresponsibilities) that allow a household to make up for\nthe missing days of work by the patient and carer. Studies\nsuggest that compensation mechanisms exist in most for-\nmal work environments[18]. In a family setting, the tak-\ning of responsibility for patient or carer duties may seem\neven more likely. However, patient responses indicated\nthat they needed almost full-time care from another\nhousehold member when they were ill and, given that the\n12-hour workday in Ninh Thuan is followed by house-\nhold chores, there is little slack time for taking up addi-\ntional work.\nResponses to the surveys gave estimates for the cost of\nseeking care at each level of the health system. However,\nthey did not represent the real distribution of malaria\npatients amongst the levels of care as all patients in the\nstudy had to attend the CHC in order to be identified for\nthe study. In reality it is believed that 60% of malaria\npatients are treated by the VHW, 38% are treated at the\nCHC, and 2% seek care elsewhere [8].\nIdeally more data from this study would have come from\nthe level of the VHW, but the study design was con-\nstrained by the need to identify confirmed malaria cases\nand by the relatively small weekly load of malaria\npatients. These considerations meant that patients needed\nto be identified at a health facility, and health workers\nused as data collectors. Poor education levels amongst\nVHW were thought likely to affect their ability to carry out\nlengthy surveys, so the CHC was chosen as the point at\nwhich patients were selected. VHW patients were identi-\nfied only if they also attended the CHC at some point. In\nreality there may be differences between those who sought\ncare at the CHC and those who sought care from the\nVHW, however no significant differences were detected in\nthis study: for example, both duration of illness and time\noff work were similar. As the CHC was the first and only\npoint of call for most study patients, the data presented\nhere are less robust with respect to costs associated with\nVHW care.\nIf the pilot CHW programme is ended and the CHC\nreturns to being the first point of access for malaria care,\nthis study estimated that this would increase overall aver-\nage travel costs by 15%. However, it is likely that, in the\nabsence of VHWs, more patients would seek care from\nalternative sources such as local drug sellers or traditional\nhealers. As seen in study responses, treatment seeking out-\nside the public services does carry a significant direct cost.\nAccurate estimates of the magnitude of this cost to the\nhousehold could not be made with the data from this\nstudy as they did not capture patients who lacked village-\nlevel services.\nReliability of data\nThe data for the economic analysis came primarily from a\nsurvey. Responses regarding assets may have omittedPage 6 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMalaria Journal 2008, 7:166 http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/7\/1\/166some assets grown (or raised in the case of livestock) on\nplots cultivated in the forest. Cultivating plots in the forest\nmay not be illegal in itself, however, much secrecy sur-\nrounds any discussion on forest activities due to the illegal\ncutting and removal of wood from government-owned\nparts of the forest. Answering survey questionnaires is\nlikely to appear extremely formal to the study population,\nwith answers likely to be adapted to suit the perceived\ndesires of government. When possible, informal discus-\nsions were used to complement survey data.\nThere may be some economic activity that was not cap-\ntured in this study. For example, it is likely that the pur-\nchase of some drugs from shops will be missed as it is\nillegal for drug sellers to sell antimalarial drugs. This direct\ncost is likely to be small in a poor area like Ninh Thuan\nwhere drugs are free to the patient in the public health\nservices. It is also possible that informal payment may not\nhave been reported given that it is known to be illegal.\nThis could have a significant effect on the study results.\nMalaria challenges the productivity of this population\nyear upon year, with the effect likely to be cumulative. The\nlevel of productivity that was calculated in this study to\nestimate income loss was the level of normal productivity\nminus the productivity loss estimated to result from an\nepisode of malaria. This level of normal productivity is\nlikely to be lower than it would be if malaria were not\naffecting household members year upon year. This means\nthat the estimated total cost of 11.79 USD per episode is\neffectively underestimated and, conversely, that the gains\nthat could be reaped in preventing malaria, over time,\nwould be greater per episode.\nConclusion\nAs in other parts of the world, malaria appears to impose\na non-negligible economic burden on the household.\nAmongst farmers of the Raglay ethnic minority in Ninh\nThuan, a south-central Vietnamese province with endemic\nforest malaria, this burden appears to be borne primarily\nin the form of indirect costs associated with decreased\nproductivity. This loss is estimated to be approximately\n11.10 USD per malaria episode. Due to take-up of govern-\nment provision of services, direct costs remained low\n(0.69 USD), making up only 6% of the total. The total cost\nof illness was estimated at 11.79 USD per episode, a sub-\nstantial burden for the poorest households in the commu-\nnity or for households experiencing multiple episodes.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCMM designed the surveys, survey methodology, and\nhelped in the initial training of health workers to conduct\nthe surveys.
