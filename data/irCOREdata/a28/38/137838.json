Introduction\nThe mass of organic matter composted in the UK has increased every year since\nnational monitoring began in 1994 (Slater et al., 2000). In 1999, 833,000 tonnes of\norganic matter were composted at 197 composting sites. This growth in composting has\nbeen driven by targets for phased reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal\nwaste being landfilled as set out in the EU Landfill Directive (1999\/31\/EC) (EC,1999)\nand in national targets such as the Waste Strategy 2000 (DETR, 2000). The majority of\nUK composting facilities process the organic waste using mechanically-turned open-air\nwindrows. Open-air windrows are likely to generate contaminated liquor at certain\ntimes of the year. This liquor results from natural precipitation which falls onto the\nwindrow and percolates through the waste, dissolving soluble substances in the process.\nLiquor will also be generated by high moisture content wastes (such as waste fruit and\nvegetables) as it decomposes (Environment Agency, 2001). Following periods of wet\nweather, the windrow may exceed its drainable limit leading to seepage from the base.\nIf the windrow has been sited on an impermeable surface (such as concrete), this\nseepage will have to be collected and stored to avoid uncontrolled runoff and pollution\nof watercourses (The Composting Association, 2001). In addition to liquor derived\nfrom the windrow, polluted runoff from contaminated hard surfaces and machinery may\nalso be collected and diverted to the liquor storage lagoon. In its draft Technical\nGuidance on Composting Operations, the Environment Agency of England and Wales\nadvises that where possible, liquor should be recirculated on to dry windrows as a\nwetting agent (Environment Agency, 2001). This practice is not always acceptable to\nthe composting site operator however. For instance at some sites, recirculation of liquor\nback to windrows has been found to generate odours and thus give rise to complaints\n3from neighbours \u2013 a problem alluded to by Fischer (1996). Where re-circulation is not\npossible, other arrangements have to be made for the disposal of liquor such as\ntankerage to local sewage treatment works \u2013 an option that is highly costly. At some\nsites, especially where composting is carried out on a farm, it would appear sensible to\napply the liquor to land in order to make use of its nutrient content. However, this\npractice is not always acceptable to the regulator because of concerns over phytotoxicity\nor potential water pollution.\nVery few studies of compost liquor quality have been published to date. There\nappears to be no database in existence of the composition of liquors from composting\nfacilities in the UK in stark contrast to that available for landfill leachates (DoE, 1995).\nFischer (1996) published some data for sites in Germany where composting occurs\nunder cover, but where maturation occurs outside. This work suggested liquor was\nhighly variable in composition and very strong in nature (e.g. BOD5 10000 \u2013 50000\nmg\/l; NH3\/NH4+ 300 \u2013 1200 mg\/l). It is also known that the composition of compost\nliquor is likely to vary according to the duration of composting (Frederickson, 1997).\nFrederickson (1997) found that liquors leached from aerobically-digested green waste\ncontained higher levels of BOD5, ammoniacal nitrogen and electrical conductivity in the\nfirst six weeks of composting than in the second 6 weeks of the trial (Table 1). This\nstudy also detected significant phytotoxic effects on radish plants irrigated with\nuntreated leachate from the first six weeks of the composting process. This finding\nraised concerns about the potential use of untreated compost liquor as an agricultural\nfertiliser.\nThe investigations described in this paper stemmed from discussions with a\ncomposting facility operator who was seeking to identify a low-cost, on-site compost\n4liquor bioremediation process that may permit discharge of the treated effluent to a\nwatercourse as an alternative to land application. The specific aim of the research was\nto establish whether low-cost materials, such as organic solids readily available at a\ngreen waste composting facility, have the potential to act as media for simple aerobic\nbiofilters suitable for farm-level design, construction and operation.\n2. Methods\n2.1 Biofilter media\nSix potential biofilter media were tested in this research. They were:\n\uf0b7 Polystyrene packaging \uf0b7 Compost\n\uf0b7 Soil \uf0b7 Oversize\n\uf0b7 Broken brick \uf0b7 Wood mulch\nThe criteria for media selection were that they should represent readily available\n(where possible waste) materials; be of no\/low cost; and should present a range of\nphysical and chemical characteristics. The broken brick material was acquired from\nHanson Brick, Stewartby, Bedfordshire. Broken brick fragments are normally\npulverized and recycled back into the system to make new bricks. The material used in\nthese experiments was oversize fragments from pulverization known as \u201cgrog oversize\u201d\nwith a typical particle size of 3-4 mm. The soil used in these experiments was a freely\ndraining sandy loam from Cranfield University farm estate at Silsoe, Bedfordshire. The\nexpanded polystyrene media was acquired from All Purpose Packaging Ltd,\nHertfordshire and is used as a loose-fill protective agent in packaging (known as\n5\u201cpacking peanuts\u201d) . The remaining three media selected were all organic materials\nreadily available at green waste composting facilities, and in this case sourced from\nOrganics Recycling Ltd., Crowland, Lincolnshire. Two of these, oversize and finished\ncompost, are the outputs of the screening of mature composted material. The fine\nmaterial passing through a 10 mm screen is the finished compost. The material with a\nparticle size of >10 mm is referred to as oversize. The oversize is normally recycled\nback into new windrows. The third of these organic media, wood mulch, was also\nacquired from Organics Recycling Ltd. where it is used as a bulking agent in the\nformation of windrows.\n2.2 Biofilter set up\nThe media to be tested were held in plastic pipes of 110 mm diameter and 1 m length,\nsupported within a steel-framed stand. The bottom of each biofilter pipe rested inside a\nplastic funnel filled with gravel, in order to support the filter media. The funnel was\nconnected to a 4 litre collection vessel by means of rubber tubing. Natural ventilation\nwas encouraged by drilling holes drilled in the upper and lower sections of the plastic\npipes. The plastic pipes were filled with the media to be tested to a depth of 1 m. In\nfilling the filters, the various media were gently agitated to avoid bridging and the\nformation of large voids, and also to avoid unnecessary compaction. A total of 24\nbiofilters were established, representing four replicates of each of the six media to be\ntested. The biofilters were situated in the open air at Cranfield University\u2019s Silsoe\ncampus in Bedfordshire, UK. A diagram of the biofilter arrangement is shown in\nFigure 1.\n2.3 Source of compost liquor and its use in the experiments\n6Compost liquor from the Organic Recycling Ltd. site in Crowland, Lincolnshire was\nused in this study. The majority of the incoming waste at this site comprises fruit,\nvegetables and food processing waste. This is mixed with various bulking agents such\nas shredded paper and straw to create structure and absorb excess liquor in the\nwindrows. A summary of key water quality characteristics of the liquor used can be\nseen in Table 2. The compost liquor was transported by lorry to Silsoe and stored in\ngalvanised tanks.\nAn organic loading rate of 0.6 kg BOD5\/m3 of biofilter volume\/d was used in these\nexperiments which is at the lower end of the range typically categorised as \u201chigh rate\u201d\naerobic biofiltration (Askew, 1969; IWEM, 1988; Gray, 1989). High organic loading\nrates lead to high oxygen demands and large accumulations of biofilm. With media not\nspecially designed to permit good ventilation, drainage and permit room for slime\naccumulation, it was considered sensible to adopt a relatively conservative organic\nloading rate. The volume of liquor required to achieve the required organic loading\n(285 ml) was applied daily to each of the biofilters.\n2.4 Analysis of liquor\nThe untreated compost liquor (influent) and treated compost liquor (effluent) were\ntested for the chemical parameters, pH, BOD5 and ammoniacal nitrogen and a biological\ntest was made to identify the suitability of the media in treating phytotoxicity effects on\nplants, using a simple cress bioassay. BOD5 was determined using an Orion 862\ndissolved oxygen probe (Thermo Electron, Boston, USA) according to standard\nmethods (HMSO, 1988). Ammoniacal nitrogen was measured using the automated\nphenate method (APHA, 1998) using a Burkard Series 2000 segmented flow analyser\n7(Burkard Scientific, Uxbridge, UK). pH was measured with an Jenway 3020 pH probe\n(Jenway, Dunmow, UK). The cress seed germination assay technique described by\nZucconi et al. (1985) was employed.\n3. Results\nSummary statistics for the ammoniacal nitrogen removal capability of the different\nbiofilter media are presented in Table 3. The oversize media demonstrated the best\nperformance over the 3 month study period achieving a mean percentage removal of\n78% and a mean post filter ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of 172 mg\/l. There was\nconsiderable variation around this mean value over the experimental period (Figure 2).\nWood mulch, the next best media, performed similarly to oversize and the polystyrene\nmedia produced the worst quality effluent.\nA similar range of values for percentage removal were attained for BOD5, with\ncompost performing best (78%) and polystyrene again the least effective (34%) (Table\n4). The variation in filter effluent quality over the study period for the two best media\n(compost and oversize) and the worst (polystyrene) is shown in Figure 3 (data for the\nother media omitted for clarity).\nThe effect of biofiltration on the phytotoxicity of the compost liquor was\ninvestigated using a cress seed germination bioassay. The untreated compost liquor was\nfound to be sufficiently phytotoxic to completely inhibit cress seed germination (Figure\n4). Biofiltration had a limited bioremediation effect, with the oversize media again\nshowing the best performance giving a mean post filter germination index of 12%\n(Table 5). Biofiltration through the polystyrene media, which again performed least\nwell, made virtually no impact on the phytotoxicity of the compost liquor (Table 5).\n8The compost liquor used in this study had an acidic pH in the range pH 4.6-5.8.\nThe impact of passage through the different filter media on pH is indicated by the mean\npost filter pH values given in Table 6 and by the curves shown in Figure 5. In general,\nbiofiltration led to an increase in pH with compost and wood mulch media facilitating\nthe greatest increase in pH and polystyrene media the least.\n4. Discussion\n4.1 General trends in effluent quality\nBiofiltration led to significant improvements in effluent quality as measured using\nBOD5, ammoniacal nitrogen and cress seed germination index as quality indicators.\nThe degree of improvement was affected by the biofiltration media utilised. The best\nmedia were able to achieve on average a 78% removal of both BOD5 and ammoniacal\nnitrogen during the study period. This figure compares favourably with work done on\nhigh rate sewage biofiltration using bespoke plastic media (Flocor) in the 1960s with\nfilter depths of 1.8-5.5 m. Askew (1969) presented curves for the performance of\nFlocor in terms of percentage BOD5 removed versus BOD5 load (kg\/m3\/d) for high rate\nbiofilters. Askew\u2019s curves suggest that about 80-85% BOD5 removal could be expected\nat a BOD5 loading rate of 0.6 kg\/m3\/d.\nIt is assumed that microbial oxidation processes were principally responsible for\nthe removal of readily biodegradable organic substances and ammoniacal nitrogen from\nthe liquor. It is reasonable to expect this as the organic loading rate of 0.6 kg\/m3\/d is at\nthe lower end of the range typically described as high rate aerobic biofiltration.\nAlthough significant percentage reductions in the concentration of BOD5 and\nammoniacal nitrogen were achieved in the experimental filters, the actual post-filter\n9effluent remained very heavily polluted. The biofiltration process may therefore be\nconsidered to have been a partial or roughing treatment step. The poor performance of\nthe experimental biofilter media with respect to reduction in phytotoxicity highlights the\nextent to which only partial treatment was achieved. The best biofilters were only able\nto register a mean percentage cress seed germination index of 12% which is\nconsiderably less than the threshold value of 60% below which a substance may be\nconsidered to be phytotoxic (Zucconi et al. 1985). The factors responsible for this\nphytotoxic effect were not investigated but ammonia toxicity may be one explanation.\nThe cress seed germination bioassay is quite a sensitive test and tells us little about\npossible negative impacts of land spreading of partially treated compost liquor to an\nestablished crop of grass. The findings therefore highlight a cause for concern\nassociated with the land recycling route and indicate the need for caution and further\ninvestigations.\nThe pH of the raw compost liquor was between 4.6 \u2013 5.8. This acidic pH was\nassumed to be the result of the formation of fermentation products in the wet conditions\nfound in some parts of the compost windrows. Biofiltration led to an increase in pH\n(Figure 5). It was also noted that the media that generally performed least well at BOD5\nand ammoniacal nitrogen removal had the smallest impact on pH whereas the more\neffective biofilters led to a greater increase in pH. It is likely organic acids were\nresponsible for the low pH of the untreated compost liquor. Oxidation of these organic\nacids in the biofilters will lead to an increase in pH \u2013 a process analogous to the control\non acidity imposed by methanogens in the anaerobic digestion process (Marchaim,\n1992). Consequently, those biofilters promoting the greatest oxidation of organic acids\n10\nwill have the greatest impact on BOD5 with the knock on effect of having the greatest\nimpact on pH.\n4.2 Performance of different biofilter media\nA simple assessment of the performance of the different biofilter media can be made by\nranking them according to their ability to improve the quality of the compost liquor with\nrespect to the key quality indicators of BOD5, ammoniacal nitrogen and cress seed\ngermination index (Table 7). This simple ranking system shows that the oversize media\nhad the best overall ranking with compost and wood mulch tied for second. The\npolystyrene media consistently performed least well.\nIt was beyond the scope of this research to try to investigate how the different\nphysical and chemical properties of the different biofilter media tested affected the\ntreatment of the compost liquor. In theory, the key properties are likely to be specific\nsurface area; void size and connectivity; media durability and strength; adsorption\ncapacity; and absorption capacity. The relative importance of some of these properties\nwas evident in the behaviour of some of the media. For example, the small pore sizes\nafforded by the soil-filled biofilter led to a rapid reduction in permeability, probably\nassociated with the accumulation of biofilm. This in turn probably led to zones of\nsaturation, a reduction in the ventilation efficiency and the development of anoxic\nconditions. Conversely, the large and connected voids of the polystyrene media coupled\nwith a low absorptive capacity appeared to shorten its hydraulic retention time in\ncomparison to that of the other filters. The other observation that can be made is that\n11\nthe three best media were all natural, organic materials sourced from and readily\navailable at an operational composting facility.\n4.3 Implications of the findings for compost liquor bioremediation and management\nIn the case of strong compost liquors such as the one used in this experiment, a low-cost\nbiofilter is not going to be able to produce a treated effluent that is capable of meeting\nthe quality requirements for discharge directly to a watercourse. Aerobic biofiltration\nhas traditionally been used as a pre-treatment to be followed by discharge to sewer or\nsome further on-site treatment process. In the case of on-farm composting facilities,\nthere is a role for pre-treatment prior to land disposal.\nThe poor performance of the treated liquor in the cress seed germination\nbioassay is a cause for concern if biofiltration is intended to be a precursor to land\napplication. Further research would be needed in the development of operational\nbiofilters to ensure that this phytotoxicity can be brought under control. Such\ninvestigations could also usefully assess the extent to which established crops are\ndamaged by irrigation or by the accumulation of phytotoxins following prolonged\nperiods of application.\nThe fact that the best performing filter media in these experiments are all readily\navailable at most green waste composting facilities is promising, as this would help to\nreduce purchase and transport costs. The other bonus is that if the filter media needed\n12\nto be replaced, the used materials could be simply recycled back into the composting\nprocess.\n5. Conclusions\nOf the potential biofilter media tested in this research, the natural, organic materials\n(oversize, compost and wood mulch) performed best. In terms of the mean percentage\nreduction in BOD5 over the study period, these media were able to achieve a level of\nperformance that is slightly below that of bespoke biofilter media designed for high rate\napplications. Although the biofilters made a significant impact on compost liquor\nquality, the filtrate remained highly polluted and would require further treatment if it\nwere to be discharged to a watercourse. Furthermore, the filtrate inhibited cress seed\ngermination and could be considered to be phytotoxic. This has implications for the\nsustainable irrigation of this effluent to agricultural land.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Andrew Riddington of Organics Recycling Ltd.\nfor the provision of compost liquor and biofilter materials; and Stephen Wise of SITA\nLtd. for advice throughout the project.
