As such,\naccessibility and usability issues need to be made explicit in project documentation, along with allo-\ncation of appropriate resources and time. We argue that accessibility and usability are intrinsically\ninter-linked. An integrated accessibility and usability evaluation methodology that we have devel-\noped is presented and discussed. The paper draws on a series of mini-case studies from e-learning\nprojects undertaken over the past 10 years at the Open University.\nIntroduction\nThe Open University (OU) is Europe\u2019s largest educational establishment, delivering\nmainly distance learning courses. The OU currently has 180,000 active students, of\nwhich about 9900 declare a disability (\u223c5.5%). Approximately one-half of all disabled\nstudents receive some form of support from the university to enable them to partici-\npate in their studies. The OU has made extensive investment in e-learning particu-\nlarly since the late 1990s. Investment continues with an ongoing multi-million pound\nvirtual learning environment (VLE) programme. The OU has a commitment to\nwidening access to higher education, to providing high-quality, interactive educa-\ntional materials that meet students\u2019 needs and operating within the mission of \u2018open-\nness to all\u2019. The OU is committed to making its online educational content and\nstudent services accessible to disabled students and usable by all; a considerable\nchallenge given the size of the OU student population.\n*Corresponding author.

Cooper et al.\nThe paper draws on examples from various projects undertaken within the OU\nover the past 10 years, presented as a series of short case studies. The purpose is not\nto highlight any failings in the way accessibility and usability was managed in any\nparticular project, but rather to draw lessons from a wide range of past and ongoing\nwork to inform the design of future projects. These case studies are used as the basis\nof identifying a set of lessons learnt, along with recommendations to enable future e-\nlearning projects to successfully integrate and embed accessibility and usability\nconsiderations.\nDefinitions of accessibility and usability\nUsability is the extent to which a system can be used by specified users to achieve\nspecified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of\nuse (Karat, 1997). Usability, in an e-learning context, can thus be defined as the\neffectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which users can achieve specified learn-\ning (or learning related) goals in a particular environment or with a particular tool or\nlearning resource. Some regard usability as synonymous with \u2018ease of use\u2019. The IMS\nAccessibility SIG defined \u2018accessibility\u2019 as the ability of the learning environment to\nadjust to the needs of all learners (IMS Global Learning Consortium, 2002). Acces-\nsibility is thus determined by the flexibility of the e-learning system or learning\nresource to meet the needs and preferences of all users. These needs and preferences\nmay arise from their environment (e.g. working in a noisy environment), the tools\nthey use (e.g. assistive technologies such as screen-readers, voice-recognition tools or\nalternative keyboards, etc.) or a disability in the conventional sense.\nAccessibility and usability are intrinsically linked. The lower the level of accessibil-\nity of a resource for an individual, the less usable it will be for them. In the worst case\nthey will not be able to use it at all. Conversely, improved accessibility for disabled\nusers promotes usability for all. Usability should play an important role in accessibil-\nity testing, since a resource presenting usability difficulties will generally present\nsignificant accessibility problems for disabled users (Sloan et al., 2002). Even sites\nwith a high level of accessibility can nevertheless have usability problems that may\nprevent people with disabilities from using them efficiently.\nMost projects developing or exploring the use of technologies in education wish to\nsee their approaches adopted in teaching and learning practice beyond the term of the\nproject. Adequately addressing accessibility and usability in their developments\nenhances the possibility of achieving this. One important reason for this is that in\nmost countries there is now anti-discrimination legislation1 relating to disabled\npeople\u2019s access to education. The introduction of e-learning technologies should not\nput barriers in the way of disabled students accessing their learning. Further, in the\nterms of the UK legislation, reasonable adjustments should be made to meet the\nneeds of disabled students in accessing the curriculum. One such reasonable adjust-\nment is addressing accessibility and usability issues in e-learning developments. If this\nis not adequately done, then a judgment has to be made as to whether that particular\ndevelopment can in fact be deployed.\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 233\nAccessibility and usability impact directly on the pedagogical effectiveness of e-\nlearning systems or resources for all learners, but particularly for disabled learners.\nThis should be reason enough for them to be addressed in all e-learning projects. It\nis invariably the case that addressing accessibility in the development phase is far\nmore cost-effective than any retrospective accessibility response and is usually less\ncostly and better pedagogically than the provision of an alternative but comparable\nlearning experience for disabled students. The main challenge in accessibility is\nresponding to the diversity of the ways different users interact with a computer envi-\nronment. As well as being encouraged to follow established accessibility guidelines,\ndevelopers need to be encouraged to always bear in mind that people interact with\ncomputers in different ways. There is globally a lack of in-depth knowledge and\nexpertise in accessibility and usability available to project teams.\nEvaluation methodologies\nEvaluation is key to any research and development effort. If we do not evaluate, how\ndo we know whether our developments achieved what we set out to achieve?\nEvaluation is also needed to enable iterative improvement. A range of different eval-\nuations is required during a research and development project, including technical\nand functional evaluations. However, in reviewing how best to embed accessibility\nand usability in research and development projects, this paper focuses on evaluation\nof the end-user experience. This section discusses issues of designing and integrating\naccessibility and usability evaluation methods generally, and then outlines a method-\nology developed by the authors. Comments are made based on the experience of\nusing and refining this methodology in different projects.\nMethods\nWhen planning an evaluation it is important that the associated aims are clearly artic-\nulated, as these will directly impact on the selection of methods and the associated\ndesign of the evaluation. Different methods are likely to be appropriate at different\nstages of the project depending on the objectives of the evaluation and the status of\nthe prototype being evaluated at that stage. This section discusses a range of different\napproaches that are common in evaluation work looking at accessibility and usability.\nIn our work we define an expert evaluation as one undertaken by an accessibility or\nusability expert in which they make an assessment of probable issues for users in inter-\nacting with the prototype being evaluated. They will usually try and replicate a user\u2019s\ninteraction with the website or software by working through scenarios or typical tasks\nexpected of the users. In assessing the accessibility of a web site or software applica-\ntion, the expert will interact with the interface using a range of assistive technologies.\nRoutinely in our work that will be a screen-reader, a screen magnifier and voice-\ncontrol software. The expert will attempt to perform all user actions without the use\nof a mouse and test the response of the software to changes in browser or operating\nsystem accessibility settings, such as text size and colour contrast.\n234 M. Cooper et al.\nThere are automated accessibility evaluation tools available such as the desktop\napplication Bobby\u2122 (Watchfire\u00ae)2 and the online service A-Checker.3 These are\ndesigned to check web sites against the criteria of existing accessibility guidelines,\nincluding Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act of 19734 and the W3C\u2019s Web\nContent Accessibility Guidelines.5 These tools have their place in supporting expert\nevaluations but, in our view, come with a \u2018handle with care\u2019 label. Such tools evalu-\nate technical accessibility. They can be very useful in rapidly discovering certain\naccessibility problems, but they cannot assess from the user perspective. It is\nperfectly possible for an educational web site, say, to meet all the Web Content\nAccessibility Guidelines accessibility criteria as assessed by such tools but not to\ngive a disabled student access to the learning. This follows from issues relating to\nusability, learning design and how these interact with accessibility. A simple illus-\ntration of this concerns the use of alt-texts6 and images. Such technically focused\ntools will highlight where \u2018alt\u2019 attributes on image elements are empty but do not\nassess whether any text in an \u2018alt\u2019 attribute is pedagogically meaningful. Similarly,\na learning resource may be technically accessible but its design means a screen-\nreader user takes so long to navigate around it that they give up before achieving or\neven discovering the learning objective. This illustrates one of the central points of\nthis paper that accessibility, usability and pedagogic issues are all interrelated in an\ne-learning context.\nWe believe that end-user engagement is vital, and we would strongly recommend\nthat projects build in the opportunity to undertake end-user evaluation as part of\ntheir project plan. A range of methods is available for engaging end-users in an\nevaluation of prototype software, web resources or applications. These methods are\ndesigned to enable the researcher to elicit the user\u2019s experience including their\nbehaviour, their perceptions and cognitive changes, their affective responses and\ntheir views. They are normally devised so that comparisons between the experi-\nences of different users are possible. It has been our experience in evaluations\nundertaken that we always gain additional insights and reveal further usability and\naccessibility issues when we conduct evaluations with users, including users with\ndisabilities.\nAsking direct questions of the participants is a basic way of eliciting information\nabout their interaction with a prototype under evaluation, although such instruments\nneed careful design. In our work we make extensive use of semi-structured interviews\nstraight after an observational session; with the former considering usability and\naccessibility criteria, and the latter focusing on validating whether the established\ncriteria have been met. When undertaking observational studies, some means of\nrecording the students\u2019 interaction with the object of evaluation is required together\nwith their reaction to the experience. At our own institution we have a dedicated\n\u2018Data Capture Suite\u2019 for this purpose. The facilities allow for the synchronous\nrecording of the user actions and the software behaviour on the screen together with\nvideo of their facial expressions and body language and audio recording of anything\nthey say. Other tools may be useful; some researchers also use keystroke recorders\nand eye-trackers, for example.\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 235\nMaking research methods more inclusive\nThis section discusses a range of issues around promoting the effective engagement\nof disabled people in research including evaluation studies. As with most types of\nresearch, in accessibility and usability evaluations framing the right research ques-\ntions is essential to the detailed design of the method, running of the evaluation\nsessions and subsequent data analysis. Research questions focus on the following\naspects: \u2018to what extent is the learning resource, web site or software application\naccessible to disabled students?\u2019, \u2018how does this compare with usability for non-\ndisabled students?\u2019, \u2018what are disabled students\u2019 opinions on \u2026?\u2019 and \u2018how does this\ncompare with those of non-disabled students?\u2019 However, it is important to note that\nsome care needs to be taken in phrasing of these questions. For example, the question\n\u2018is this web site\/software accessible?\u2019 is inappropriate because a given web site may be\naccessible to some people but not to others. Similarly there are different degrees of\naccessibility, which will also be influenced by additional tools the user might use to\nfacilitate their access.\nThis section gives some of the findings from our own reflection on adopting an\nintegrated usability and accessibility methodology. We try to apply a philosophy of\ncontinued improvement to our own methodology. Disabled participants often\nneeded more time to complete a task; this is important in designing a learning\nresource and how it is to be used, but is also important in the evaluation design. There\nare noticeable different levels of interaction in an evaluation task between disabled\nand non-disabled users. Disabled people are often aware of the need for accessibility\nand focus at a \u2018technical\u2019 level; that is, whether they can get to the functionality. In\nother words they look for accessibility issues. Non-disabled people typically focus at\na \u2018personal use\u2019 level (e.g. why would I want to use this website or software?). It seems\nto be the case that non-disabled users are more reluctant to be negative in their\ncomments about the web site or software under evaluation.\nThere is very little literature on inclusion of disabled people in research. Accessibil-\nity research often focuses on questions of ease of access for disabled users; however,\nthey need also to take account of the accessibility of the evaluation methods they use.\nSampling is important, but can be challenging in this area. In any research into users\u2019\nexperiences, the more representative of the general target population the sample of\nusers, the more likely the research is to reveal issues reflecting a diversity of users.\nSampling of the population is a particular challenge in accessibility research. There is\na wide diversity in the ways people with disabilities choose or need to interact with the\ncomputer. It is worth noting that it is the way an individual elects to interact with a\ncomputer environment that is important in accessibility research, not any medical\nclassification of disability per se. Although we have undertaken studies with about 100\nusers, more typically we work with about 10 disabled users in a study. This is not\nsufficient to cover the functional requirements of all disabled people in their interac-\ntions with the computer; however, we select users who are likely to be particularly\nchallenged by the application under evaluation. We supplement user evaluations with\nexpert judgements and we believe that it is better to engage with 10 disabled people\n236 M. Cooper et al.\nin an evaluation than none; even engaging with five disabled people can provide\nvaluable insights.\nDifferent methods raise different issues when undertaking accessibility research.\nAn illustration of some of these is provided here. Observational evaluations raise a\nnumber of issues, particularly in terms of ensuring that an appropriate environment\nis provided for the end-user and any necessary adaptations for disabled students\nshould be organised in advance. For example, assistive technologies and\/or adjustable\nfurniture may be needed, facilitators (sign-language interpreters or note-takers) may\nbe required, written instructions may be required for hearing impaired participants or\nlarge print for visually impaired participants. It is often necessary for the researcher\nto be in the same room as the participant for communication with hearing impaired\nand speech impaired participants. Finally, it may be necessary to factor in more time\nfor tasks depending on the needs of those taking part in the study. Focus groups raise\nadditional issues; for example, it can be difficult to include people with visual\/hearing\/\nspeech impairments, and access issues for other disability groups (e.g. those with\ndyslexia if flip-charting\/post-it techniques are used) need to be thought through.\nSurveys provide a different set of issues to those involving face-to-face interaction.\nThe primary one is whether alternative methods can be offered (e.g. telephone\/paper\/\nonline surveys) to ensure maximum accessibility. Similar questions arise with inter-\nviewing\u2014are telephone\/email\/conferencing alternatives possible? With technology\nfield trials, can adaptations for mobile technologies be used or are participants\nallowed to use their own technology? Newer techniques also raise interesting issues in\nterms of the possibility they offer. For example, how might a method that includes\neye tracking be adapted to be inclusive with visually impaired participants? In some\ncases tracking mouse trails or the screen-reader focus might be a way of collecting\ncomparable data, but this is not yet a method evaluated by the authors. Remote\nevaluations over the Internet using virtual screen software in conjunction with various\nInternet communication tools are becoming increasingly popular. This approach is\nbeing adopted by some as a way of making disabled testers more readily available to\nresearchers (e.g. Usability Exchange Service7).\nEnd-user evaluations can yield a body of rich and diverse data. Analysing this\nrequires application of appropriate qualitative data analysis techniques. Accessibility\nand usability problems can be identified by end-users not being able to complete a set\ntask, by unexpected behaviour of the system or the user, by direct reporting from the\nusers, and so on. A more detailed discussion of qualitative data analysis techniques is\noutside the scope of this paper. However, evidently planning the analysis should be\nan integral process in devising the evaluation methodology for a given study.\nWhen first seeking to integrate and further develop established accessibility and\nusability methodologies in our work at the OU, the following objectives were\nestablished in the approach we adopted: \n1. To use, as far as possible, the same methods with disabled and non-disabled\nparticipants.\n2. To clearly identify usability and accessibility issues.\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 237\n3. To produce a report in which there is no conflict between the recommendations\nfor usability and accessibility improvements.\n4. To produce a report that is useful and usable by the developers in their subse-\nquent work.\nTo a large extent all these have been met as our methodology has evolved. Objective\none is often achieved by devising comparable methods rather than identical ones. By\ninvolving both disabled and non-disabled people in integrated studies of accessibility\nand usability, objective two has been achieved. By having accessibility and usability\nexperts working together in the studies, objective three has been met. In fact, since\nadopting the integrated methodology no such conflicts have arisen. However, others\nhave reported to us that in commissioning separate usability and accessibility studies\nthey have received conflicting recommendations from each. Objective four has been\nachieved by producing, in the main succinct, bullet-point reports with clear\nnumbered recommendations (so developers can treat them like a bug report), sugges-\ntions of techniques (so developers are not left with the question \u2018so what do I do about\nit?\u2019) and offers of clarification that promote an onward working relationship between\nthe developers and the accessibility and usability experts. We are currently working\non ways of enhancing the data collection opportunity in the precious time that we\nhave the user in front of a prototype. We are seeking to reduce the dependence on\nvideo records to speed up data analysis and also to allow us more readily to extend\nour methodology to remote evaluations. We are also seeking to reduce non-disabled\nusers\u2019 \u2018need to please\u2019 and encourage critical review.\nBrief case studies of past and present projects\nThis section describes five projects either internal to the OU or in which the OU has\nparticipated, and reviews how accessibility and usability were addressed in each of\nthem. The authors either were directly involved in or were called upon to advise and\nevaluate prototypes in all of these projects.\nThe Lyceum tool\nLyceum is a synchronous groupware communication tool that was developed by the\nOU and subsequently used widely in course delivery. It facilities online group work-\ning and was designed specifically for an educational context. It began life as a research\nproject within the OU\u2019s Knowledge Media Institute8 that ran from 1995 to 1998.\nFollowing successful trials in a course context in 1999, the system was handed over\nto Learning and Teaching Solutions,9 who have developed and maintained it ever\nsince. Lyceum supports interactions between tutors and students and between\nstudents and students in a variety of capacities, such as tutoring, group work, negoti-\nation, collaborative writing and peer-to-peer communication. It facilities voice\nconferencing, virtual rooms, shared concept mapping and collaborative white-board-\ning. The authors have been involved in the evaluation of various applications of\n238 M. Cooper et al.\nLyceum in different course and project contexts but were not involved in evaluation\nof the original research project prototype. Lyceum is coming to the end of its life now\nand a tendering process is underway for a replacement.\nLyceum is a good example of an e-learning project that then gets embedded into\nteaching and learning practice. This take up of the tool was because many of the course\nteams (particularly in languages) could see the pedagogic potential for their subject\narea. This move from research to practice, however, has not been without its chal-\nlenges, particularly with respect to accessibility issues. The original Lyceum project\ndid not include work on accessibility issues, as the researchers were concentrating at\nthe time more on the pedagogic potential of the technology. Furthermore, the Lyceum\ndevelopment work occurred before the WCAG 1.0 Web Content Accessibility Guide-\nlines were published, at a time when accessibility had a much lower profile. The unfor-\ntunate consequence of not considering accessibility in the initial project was that\nconsiderable re-engineering had to be done when it was handed over for mainstream\nuse in order to meet even basic accessibility criteria. This substantially increased the\ndevelopment costs of Lyceum and delayed the release date of the software. However,\nimproved accessibility has been one of the objectives of subsequent software upgrades.\nOpenMark-S for e-assessment\nOpenMark-S was an internal OU project concerned with the development of online\nformative and summative assessment. In particular, it supports the creation and deliv-\nery of interactive questions that go beyond the constraints of simple multiple-choice\nquestions. The project has made accessibility a high priority, and the second author\nwas involved in conducting evaluation of prototypes with disabled students. An\nimportant lesson from this project was that the point when software is being upgraded\nprovides a good opportunity to address any accessibility deficits in the versions. In\nthis project the second author was involved as an accessibility expert from the early\nstage of the development phase of the project. A close working relationship was\nfostered between the developer and the accessibility expert with frequent contact.\nBecause of this and because of the project design, frequent iterations were possible\nthroughout the developments of the project.\nThe DiVA project\nDiVA, the Digital Video Applications research project, ran from 2000 to 2004.10 The\nproject investigated the use of digital video within various academic contexts. This\nincluded using the DiVA system to locate clips from existing television programmes\nfor re-use in other media, the pedagogical impact of the use of video and whether the\nDiVA system could improve access to video material for hearing impaired users.\nCentral to the project was the evaluation of the use and impact of digital video in these\ncontexts. The evaluation findings were incorporated into a final report delivered in\nMay 2005 that made recommendations for the future of digital video within the OU.\nDiVA was a good example of a project that included research into the needs of disabled\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 239\nstudents from the outset. Included in its research agenda was the objective of exploring\nhow best to present transcripts, especially for people with a hearing impairment,\nalongside video material. A key lesson to be drawn is the value of formulating specific\nresearch questions relating to the needs of disabled students from the outset.\nThe OU-VLE (Moodle) programme\nThe ongoing OU-VLE Development Programme is developing a VLE11 for the OU\nintegrating a range of computer-mediated services around a courseware server based\non the Open Source12 (OS) course management system Moodle.13 It consists of a\nrange of specific projects focused on different aspects of developing the VLE. These\ninclude the Integrated Online Experience Project (portals and personalisation), ePort-\nfolios,14 eAssessment (online formative and summative computer-marked assess-\nment), online collaboration and communications (asynchronous and synchronous\ntools such as Blogs, Wikis, web conferencing, instant messaging, etc.), mobile learner\nsupport and mathematical and scientific content. The system is now in use by courses\nacross the OU. A second major production release is scheduled for February 2008.\nAccessibility has been a key priority, and the first author has been charged with overall\nresponsibility for accessibility across all the projects within the programme. The\nsecond and third authors are undertaking a series of expert and end-user accessibility\nand usability evaluations of different components of the VLE as they reach usable\nprototypes. Moodle is an OS community development and the OU is investing consid-\nerable resources and effort to enhance the accessibility and usability of the system.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages in addressing the accessibility agenda in an\nOS context as opposed to a propriety one; when a user detects an accessibility problem\nin an OS application, a fix will often occur more rapidly than with propriety software;\nhowever, the inherent nature of OS development\u2014making software publicly available\nin early versions so the community can contribute to its further development\u2014often\nmeans that products are released with accessibility poorly addressed. Key accessibility\nbenefits follow from consistency of interface design and behaviour across an applica-\ntion. With a more loosely coordinated and distributed team of developers contributing\nto an OS product there is a risk that this consistency is not achieved. Where an OS\ndevelopment results in the rapid release of updated versions of the software, any\nchanges in interface design and behaviour can be more problematic for some disabled\nusers as it may take them longer to discover and understand such changes.\nThe OU undertook a detailed review of many of the then available VLEs prior to\nselecting Moodle. It found that most addressed accessibility poorly. In selecting\nMoodle, although there were known accessibility problems, because it was an OS\ncommunity project, the OU felt it could contribute to addressing these. The first two\nauthors and a developer formed the core of a working group to draw up a Moodle\nAccessibility Specification.15 This document gives general information to facilitate\ndevelopers addressing accessibility and gives a prioritised list of specific issues to be\naddressed to improve to the accessibility of Moodle. It was based on a detailed expert\nevaluation of many (but not all) features in Moodle version 1.6. The document was\n240 M. Cooper et al.\nposted to the openly accessible Moodle Docs16 site (so that the knowledge could be\nshared across the Moodle community), and developers at Moodle.com were then\ncommissioned to undertake the software changes necessary to meet most of the high-\npriority issues identified in the specification. The second author has been undertaking\nreviews of these changes to confirm that the accessibility benefits sort have indeed\nbeen achieved. This and other accessibility and usability enhancements will, subject\nto evaluation, be incorporated into future versions of Moodle released and will thus\nbenefit all Moodle users.\nThe OU-VLE Development Programme represents a highly complex set of inter-\nrelated projects. Addressing accessibility across these has required action at both a\nstrategic and project level, as well as at the fine detail of the specific developments.\nThere is still much to do but the current status in terms of accessibility and usability\nissues is summarised here. Steady progress is being made on making Moodle more\naccessible, although there still are accessibility issues. Aspects of the VLE are not\ncurrently as usable as they might be, which is an issue for all students, but particularly\naffects students with disabilities, and usability studies have shown that some inter-\nfaces are not sufficiently intuitive. There is also a lack of consistency across the differ-\nent component web sites that have very different interaction styles. With this in mind\nwe recognise that we need more student testing, on a more regular basis, in a more\ntimely fashion, in order to ensure that we have a fully accessible and usable VLE. A\nkey challenge has been how to integrate development work and evaluations in such as\nlarge-scale venture. Development work regularly over-runs its target delivery date.\nHowever, there is a significant lead-time (typically six to eight weeks) required to plan\na set of end-user evaluations. This is because of the need to recruit participants in\nadvance and to plan the detailed methodologies. An end-user evaluation requires a\nworking prototype without too many bugs but further requires appropriate content to\npopulate the prototype to design meaningful tasks for the participants to undertake.\nDelays in the development of prototypes and the release of appropriate content has\nresulted in evaluation sessions that have gained less insights than might otherwise\nhave been possible. The experience of scheduling issues in earlier phases of the OU-\nVLE work has meant that we are now leaving much more time for testing in the\nforthcoming development phase.\nThe EU4ALL project\nThe European Unified Approach for Accessible Lifelong Learning EU4ALL17\nproject started in October 2006. This is a major, four-year project with overall\nfunding of US$10 million (US$1.6 million allocated to the OU). The project\naddresses systemic issues in providing access for disabled learners to Lifelong\nLearning.18 It sets forward the concept of Accessible Lifelong Learning uniting\nthree key strategies: \n\u25cf Technology that mediates lifelong learning does so in an accessible way.\n\u25cf Technology is used to bring specialist support services to disabled learners.\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 241\n\u25cf Support services and a technical infrastructure are provided to enable staff at\neducational institutions to more readily offer their teaching and services in a way\nthat is accessible to disabled learners.\nThe aim of EU4ALL is to improve the efficiency and efficacy of implementing these\nstrategies by developing an open service architecture. To achieve a wide impact, the\napproach taken is not to develop a single EU4ALL system but a standards-based\nframework that facilitates the integration of the approach with a wide range of e-\nlearning systems. This will be validated by integration with two OS VLEs: dotLRN19\nand Moodle. EU4ALL is in the early stages so comments here are confined to issues\nassociated with project design. Our prior experience of projects of this kind suggests\nusability and accessibility should be integrated across the different phases of the\nproject (requirements capture, specification, design, development and validation). In\nsuch a large-scale project this means integrating this work in the planning stage\nbetween many of the subprojects. This is a challenge in project design, and subse-\nquently project management. The EU4ALL project is addressing many issues of\naccessibility at a systems level rather than just at the interface level. This includes\npersonalisation to the needs of different users with disabilities and the automated\nserving of alternative resources where required. Designing end-user evaluations that\ncan contribute early to the iterative development of these is challenging. This follows\nfrom the fact that many technical issues need to be addressed to make these systems\nwork before a meaningful user experience can be created for evaluation.\nRecommendations\nThis section gives a set of recommendations for future projects based on our analysis\nof the experience in mini-case studies described in this paper. We have argued that\nevaluation has an essential role in embedding of accessibility and usability into a\nproject plan. Specific numbered recommendations are listed here under different\nareas for consideration.\nProject proposals\n1. The rationale for usability and accessibility should be clearly stated in the proposal.\n2. There should be appropriate allocation of how the usability and accessibility work\nwill be resourced in the project.\n3. Usability and accessibility should be reflected in the project research questions,\nwhich should include something that involves an investigation of usability for all\nand accessibility for disabled students.\nProject design, development and evaluation\n4. Accessibility and usability criteria need to be built into the specification.\n5. Accessibility and usability experts need to be brought in the earliest possible stage.\n242 M. Cooper et al.\n6. If a use-case-based approach for arriving at a specification is adopted, then use-\ncases should be developed that include disabled people as \u2018actors\u2019.\n7. If integrating with third-party software, its accessibility and usability needs to be\nreviewed.\n8. The project should address the fact that accessibility and usability are system\ndesign issues, not just interface design issues.\n9. An integrated evaluation plan should be adopted that includes accessibility,\nusability and educational evaluation.\n10. Outline methodologies for the planned evaluations need to be produced early\u2014\nthis will effect the detailed planning of the developers work.\n11. Accessibility issues associated with any data collection methods used need to be\nfully considered and accommodations devised to meet the meets of disabled\npeople as necessary.\nIterative development\nIterative design is essential to any software development project; however, making\nthis effective requires a close integration of the work carried out by the developers and\nthe evaluators involved in the project. Therefore, the following issues need to be\naddressed early in any project: \n12. Where in the project plan are expert and end-user evaluations most appropriate?\n13. Sufficient time and development resource allocation after an evaluation is\nrequired to respond to any recommendations that arise from the evaluation.\n14. To be effective end-user evaluations, the prototypes under investigation needs to\nbe populated with appropriate content and activates for the users to interact with\nin a realistic way.\n15. End-user evaluations require a reasonable lead time to facilitate the recruitment\nof participants and the preparation of the detail of the evaluation methods, which\nwill be dependent on the content and activities.\n16. Development work almost inevitably takes longer than anticipated. Contingency\nplans need to be in place to deal with this.\nSuccessfully project managing for usability and accessibility\nHow successfully issues relating to the end-user experience are addressed in a project\ndepends on how accessibility and usability are managed within the project. This is\nbecause accessibility and usability issues transcend many areas of a project. It is\nappropriate to liken responsibility for accessibility in a project to health and safety at\nwork policies, where everyone has responsibility for health and safety but specific\nduties and areas of responsibility are delegated to named individuals. Similarly,\neveryone in an e-learning research and development project team has to pay due\nregard to accessibility and usability issues. However, experience in past projects has\nshown that it is often advantageous to have a named member of the project team with\nEmbedding accessibility and usability 243\noverarching responsibility for accessibility and usability. This person should have the\npermission of the project team to repeatedly ask \u2018what are the accessibility and\nusability implications for this?\u2019\nThe problem of integrating evaluation work with development schedules that often\nslip has been discussed above. Probably the only way to address this is by detailed\ninitial planning and periodic progress and planning reviews. Close communications\nbetween development and evaluation teams is important so that early notice is given\nif slippages are anticipated and plans can be adjusted accordingly. There is inevitably\na tension between developers and evaluators of software. The former perceive the\nlatter of criticising work in which they have usually invested significant amounts of\neffort and professional expertise. The evaluators see the developers as reluctant to\nrespond to their recommendations. Better relations and a better outcome for the\nproject are promoted if an integrated team approach is fostered; with developers and\nevaluators seeing each other as partners with a common goal, calling on each others\u2019\nareas of expertise as necessary. To achieve this, evaluators should be involved\nthroughout the project, participating in the specification work from the outset and\nbeing available to developers at any point. For example, a developer may ask a\nquestion of the form: \u2018I was thinking of implementing <a function> this way, what do\nyou think will be the accessibility and usability implications of that?\u2019 Conversely, an\nevaluator might ask: \u2018I have been looking at how we have implemented < a function>,\ncan you advise me whether it can be adapted to incorporate <an approach> that I\nthink will promote accessibility?\u2019.\nConcluding comments\nIn summary, a few of the more important points from the discussion of this paper are\nhighlighted here. We argue that accessibility, usability and pedagogic issues are all\ninterrelated in an e-learning context. Accessibility and usability issues need to be\naddressed throughout a project\u2019s lifecycle to ensure its developments are subse-\nquently adopted in educational delivery. Evaluations are key to ensuring accessibility\nand usability issues have been addressed in a project\u2019s developments. Valuable\ninsights can be gained when conducting evaluations with a range of users leading to\noverall improvements in the system being developed. We believe that integrating\naccessibility and usability evaluations yields distinct benefits over treating them as\nseparate areas for study. We have described how care is needed when drawing up\nevaluation methodologies, to ensure that they are inclusive and consistent for both\ndisabled people and non-disabled people acting as participants. However, we have\nalso discussed how accessibility and usability raise fundamental issues for how\nprojects are organised and run.\nWe believe that enhancing the end-user experience of an e-learning system or\nresource, by comprehensively addressing accessibility and usability, impacts posi-\ntively on the effectiveness of the learning, and hope that we have illustrated why this\nshould be a key reason for giving them due consideration, effort and resources in any\ne-learning project.\n244 M.
