Reflecting on the \u2018lessons\u2019 of East Asian \ndevelopment and growth \n \nJonathan Rigg \n \n\u2018Geography does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme\u2019 (With apologies to Mark Twain) \n \nDevelopment geographers are interested in the spatial patterning of temporal change. \nThis apparently straight-forward statement, however, hides a multitude of possible \nperiodicities and temporal scales on the one hand, and spatial units and geographical \nscales on the other (Table 1). The outcome is that we should expect difference not just \nbetween continents, but also through time and variously at different scales (see also \nBebbington, Klak, and Mohan and Power in this forum). This does not mean that we \nshould shy away from looking for common experiences, shared lessons, and rhyming \npatterns (geographies) and periodicities (histories).  \n \nTable 1: Scales and periodicities in development geography \n \n Scales and \nperiodicities \nObjects and contexts \nContinental \nNational \nRegional \nVillage\/community \nHousehold \nSpatial \npatterning \nIndividual \nDevelopment status, incomes, poverty, structure \nof the economy, livelihoods, levels of social and \neconomic integration, migration and mobility, \ndiversification, hybrid spaces, spatial \ncommunities\u2026 \nHistories \nEras \nGenerations \nLife courses \nTemporal \nchange \nNarratives \nDevelopment trajectories, production and \nreproduction of poverty, structural change, trends \nin well-being and livelihoods, gender relations \nand transformations, quality of life, human-\nenvironment relations, generational changes, \npanel studies, livelihood dynamics\u2026 \n \nThis short piece approaches the debate over East Asian development in three ways. \nFirst, it considers the dangers of country and region-level generalisations; second, it \nshows how certain views and pronouncements about East Asia\u2019s growth have been \nrecycled in different guises and contexts for approaching half a century; and third, it \nargues that the most productive avenue for comparison is by focusing on development \n\u2018themes\u2019, rather than on the grand narrative.    \n \nIn seeking out the rhymes of development, country-level comparisons are both the \nmost seductive and, in some regards, the most futile in their attempt to distil a \ncomplex and variegated process \u2013 development \u2013 into a singular set of lessons or \nissues. Nonetheless, the tyranny of the nation state, of country league tables, of \nnational development projects and programmes, and of the ordering of the world \nleads us inexorably to make comparisons between countries and, sometimes, between \ncontinents. Nowhere, possibly, has this tendency been greater than in the comparisons \nthat have been drawn between the development experience of East Asia \u2013 widely seen \nto be positive \u2013 and the rest of the developing world. This search for lessons can be \ntraced back at least to the 1960s \n \nMyint, in an early and influential paper (Myint 1967), used the experience of Asia to \nrecommend an \u2018outward-looking\u2019 development strategy involving the promotion of \nexports and support for foreign investors and domestic entrepreneurs.1 Yamazawa \n(1992) also emphasised the benefits of an outward-looking strategy, but highlighted \nthe importance of regional cooperation and interdependence over global economic \nintegration in Asia\u2019s growth, writing of a \u2018flying geese pattern\u2019 of industrial \ndevelopment.2 Critical to this industrial transfer was the maintenance of a policy \nenvironment favourable to free(ish) trade, conducive to foreign direct investment and, \nin broad terms, outward-looking in orientation. The study with the highest profile, \nhowever, was the World Bank\u2019s (1993) attempt to distil the \u2018essence\u2019 of the East \nAsian miracle into a set of policy prescriptions from which other countries might \nlearn. While this study was quickly criticised for its failure adequately to \nacknowledge and record the role of the state in stage managing Asia\u2019s growth \n(Amsden 1994, Huff 1995, Leftwich 1995, Perkins 1994), the market-led global \nintegration paradigm remained \u2013 and remains \u2013 powerful and influential.3 Most \nrecently, the Commission on Growth and Development (CGD 2008) has set out to \nidentify \u2018strategies for sustained growth and inclusive development\u2019, based on 13 \n\u2018success stories\u2019, of which nine are East Asian.4 Like the World Bank\u2019s report 15 \nyears earlier, the Commission sets out to identify the \u2018right mix of ingredients\u2019 for \ngrowth, of which taking advantage of opportunities in the global economy \n(integration) and creating the incentives and investments for private investment, are \ncentral.  \n \nIn summary, the big issues that have shaped the macro-development debate in East \nAsia over the last half century have revolved around six questions, which have been \n(re-)circulated rather than transformed over that period: \n \n1. How important has global economic integration (\u2018openness\u2019), reflected in \nflows of FDI, been to Asia\u2019s economic and developmental success? \n2. What roles have the state (\u2018developmental states\u2019) and \u2018good governance\u2019 \n(and, during the Asian economic crisis, \u2018crony capitalism\u2019) played in Asia\u2019s \nmodel of growth, and by association what is the role of the market? \n3. How important have interactions and inter-dependencies at the regional level \nbeen in shaping development and forging growth? \n4. What have been the roles of culture and society (\u2018Asian values\u2019, the \u2018Asian \nway\u2019) in explaining Asia\u2019s economic vitality? \n                                                     \n1 Myint (1967) categorised Burma and Indonesia as \u2018inward-looking\u2019 countries, and the Philippines, \nThailand and Malaysia as \u2018outward-looking\u2019.. \n \n2 This metaphor was first used by Kaname Akamatsu in the mid-1930s, in a Japanese language \npublication. He later developed the theme in English language papers (Akamatsu 1962: 3 and 11). \n \n3 These criticisms were not new, but drew on a number of earlier publications: .e.g Johnson 1982, \nWade 1990 and Amsden 1989. \n \n4 The others are: Botswana, Brazil, Malta and Oman. \n \n5. Can we view Asia as an exemplar of development success (\u2018good\u2019 change, \npro-poor growth), as well as a paragon of economic prowess? \n6. Was Asia simply in the right place at the right time (the historical \u2018moment\u2019 \nargument)? \n \nThe debate over what has made (parts of) Asia so economically successful is \nimportant, but ultimately we take away from the discussion barely more than we \narrived with: geography matters; culture and society matter; policies and the quality of \ngovernment matter; and the opportunities afforded by history matter. The CGD report \nshows the contortions needed to tread the line between specifying and generalising: \n \n\u201cThe report identifies some of the distinctive characteristics of high-growth \neconomies and asks how other developing countries can emulate them. It does not \nprovide a formula for policy makers to apply \u2013 no generic formula exists. Each \ncountry has specific characteristics and historical experiences that must be \nreflected in its growth strategy. But the report does offer a framework that should \nhelp policy makers create a growth strategy of their own\u201d (2008: 2). \n \nThe more constructive \u2013 but possibly less entertaining \u2013 entr\u00e9e into the debate is \noffered at the sub-national level and in thematic discussions within the wider ambit of \ndevelopment. Nested within the wider question of whether Asia is an example of \n\u2018modernisation without development\u2019 (question 5, above), for example, lies a series of \nresearch themes that offer more purchase than the grand meta-narratives of economic \ntransformation when it comes to comparison (Table 2). There has, thus, been a rich \ndebate about how to define \u2018pro-poor growth\u2019, whether it has been achieved \u2013 or not \u2013 \nin different countries, why these differences exist, and what policy lessons can be \ndrawn (see Ravallion and Chen 2003 and 2007, Kraay 2006, Ravallion and Datt 2002, \nZepeda 2004, Lopez 2004). At the same time, the related issue of quality of life and \nnotions of well-being has been instructively explored between countries to understand \nwhy \u2018improving\u2019 measures of income-poverty may be accompanied by a fall in well-\nbeing (see http:\/\/www.bath.ac.uk\/econ-dev\/wellbeing\/).   \n \nTable 2: Themes that underlie the grand narratives \n \n Regional Community\/household \nPro-poor growth and it\u2019s \nachievement \nPanel studies tracking \ntrajectories of change over \ntime \nUrban bias Quality of life and well-\nbeing \n5. Can we view Asia as an \nexemplar of development \nsuccess (\u2018good\u2019 change), \nas well as a paragon of \neconomic prowess? \nRegional inequalities Gender and generational \ninequalities \n Rural\/urban inequalities  Sustainable livelihoods \n Sustainable development Risk, vulnerability and \nresilience \n Inter-personal inequality \n(national and regional) \nInter-personal inequality \n(local) \n  Social capital \n \n\u2018Deagrarianisation\u2019 is a good example of how a theme that may have first been \ndeveloped in one country or continent has been exported to other contexts, and been \nadapted, extended and\/or challenged in various ways. Bryceson coined the term in the \n1990s to describe a \u201clong-term process of occupational adjustment, income earning \nreorientation, social identification and spatial relocation of rural dwellers [in Africa] \naway from strictly agricultural-based modes of livelihood\u201d (2002: 726, and see \nBryceson 1996, 1997). I then used the term in the context of rural change in mainland \nSoutheast Asia (Rigg 2001, Rigg and Nattapoolwat 2001), adding a further defining \ncharacteristic \u2013 spatial interpenetration \u2013 to take account of the scope for intense \nspatial interactions and higher degrees of mobility. Potter and Badcock (2004, 2007) \nworking with tree crop small holders in Indonesia, noted the shaping role of adat \n(traditional forms of land tenure) in preventing the full emergence of a deagrarianised \nrural landscape while Francks (2006), in Japan, has seen the persistence of the small-\nscale, pluriactive rural household not as indicative of relict peasant tendencies but as a \ncreative response to the changing conditions brought about by deep industrialisation. \nSteward (2007) has also found traction in the use of the term in the Amazon, but \nhighlights the long historical roots of pluriactivity and the role of decentralisation \npolicies in Brazil in driving rural incomes and employment diversification (see also \nBebbington in this forum). In Africa, meanwhile, scholars like Yaro (2006) in \nnorthern Ghana, have challenged the premise of the deagrarianisation thesis, \nidentifying more scope for intensification within the farm sector and rather less for \nnon-farm diversification due to the marginalisation of the poor peasantry and their \nlack of resources and market links. Both he and Parnwell (2007) note the \n\u2018reversibility\u2019 of trends and the possibilities for re-agrarianisation and re-\npeasantisation (see also Fold in this forum). \n \nInterpretations of the grand narratives of development, transformation and change are \ninvariably the most appealing, particularly to policy-makers. As this piece has argued, \nhowever, to dissemble the grand national and regional narratives into bite sized \u2018hot \ntips\u2019 is difficult, and if taken too far can create a tendency towards development and \ndevelopment planning \u2018by design\u2019. That said, high level discussions remain important, \nnot least because they can sometimes galvanise debate. One can point, for example, to \nGunnar Myrdal\u2019s Asian drama (1968), the World Bank\u2019s East Asian miracle (1993) \nand, more latterly, Paul Collier\u2019s The bottom billion (2007) and Jeffrey Sachs\u2019 \nCommon wealth (2008). \n \nThere are, however, ways of dealing with the problematic tendency towards \nreductionism and simplification (see also Folds in this forum). First it is possible to \nask why countries with apparently similar policy and planning environments have \nsuch varied experiences (outcomes) or, alternatively, why those with different \nenvironments have similar experiences of development. These questions require that, \nhaving stripped the bones clean of context, it is reapplied to make the geographical, \nhistorical and social contingency of development clear. In this way, the ambition of \nthe grand narrative is allied to and tempered by the necessity to test and validate such \nambition. The second approach is to embark on the task of comparison and cross-\ncontinental inter-change and learning through the interrogation of more modest sub-\nthemes such as deagrarianisation, the role of social capital, or notions of well-being. It \nis in these areas where we are more likely to make fruitful cross-continental \ncomparisons (still all too rare), and more likely to discern Mark Twain\u2019s rhyming. \n \nReferences \n \nAkamatsu, Kaname (1962) \u201cA historical pattern of economic growth in developing \ncountries\u201d, Developing Economies 1: 3-25.
