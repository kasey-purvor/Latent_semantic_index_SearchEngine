C\/N ratios (weight ratios of the elements) have \nbeen widely used to support \u03b415N (and \u03b413C) by broadly distinguishing between terrestrial and \naquatic sourced OM. The N composition of aquatic derived OM (protein and lipid rich) is \nconsiderably greater than for that of terrestrial OM (cellulose and lignin rich) dependent upon \nthe availability of N in the environment. In addition, \u03b413C of OM has been employed to \nidentify carbon sources and photosynthetic pathways in plants [e.g. C3 and C4 plant \ndifferentiation; 12, 13], assess C dynamics in soil systems and study trophic levels in \nenvironmental systems [1, 2, 4, 14], and understand C mineralisation processes [e.g. 15, 16, \n17].  \n \nThese interpretations assume that C\/N ratios, \u03b413C and \u03b415N of OM can be reliably \ndetermined. For C\/N ratios and \u03b413C, this relies upon the complete removal of inorganic \ncarbon (IC) from the sample total carbon pool, typically achieved through acid pre-treatment, \nwithout alteration of sample OM [e.g. 18]. In contrast, measurements of %N and \u03b415N are \ncommonly made on untreated sample material, on the assumption that inorganic nitrogen (IN) \ndoes not contribute to the total sample N (though this may not be valid in all environments \n[e.g. 19, 20, 21]). However, it is becoming increasingly common to measure C\/N ratios, \u03b413C \nand \u03b415N as part of a single, \u201cdual-mode\u201d analysis [e.g. 4, 22, 23, 34]. In this case, if IC must \nbe removed by acid treatment it is necessary to establish that this treatment does not affect \nthe %N or \u03b415N of OM. \n \nThe effect of pre-analysis acid preparation methods on %N and \u03b415N can be significant [e.g. 1, \n3]. Losses in %N have been reported in the range of 0 \u2013 50% [e.g. 18, 25, 26, 27] alongside \nartificial gains of ~ 20 % [18]. In addition, and like known variabilities in \u03b413C previously \nreported [18], results for shifts in \u03b415N are variable indicating an increase of 0.1 \u2013 3 \u2030 [1], a \ndecrease of 0.2 \u20131.8 \u2030 [1, 3, 14, 22, 28], and no significant change [29, 31], with no apparent \ntrend in the size of offset related to the type of material (i.e. modern or ancient, terrestrial or \naquatic). In addition, disproportionate and non-systematic offsets in C and N of OM due to \nacid treatment contribute to this variability [e.g. 18, 30, 31], and could preclude interpretation \nof sedimentary \u03b415N records with a range of ~ 1 \u2013 4 \u2030 [e.g. 20, 32, 33, 34]. An investigation \ninto the effects of pre-analysis acid preparation methods on \u03b415N of OM is therefore justified. \n \nWe aim to investigate the effect of pre-analysis acid preparation methods on measured \u03b415N \nvalues of OM. We test the hypothesis that the measured \u03b415N values are not different between \npre-analysis acid preparation methods. We compare untreated material, and material acid \ntreated in the two most common methods; i) the capsule method and; ii) the rinse method; \nand use HCl as the acidifying reagent. We also independently investigate the effect of capsule \ntype. These methods all use different capsules; the rinse method and untreated method use tin \n(Sn) capsules, whereas the capsule method uses silver (Ag) capsules, thus an investigation \ninto the influence of different capsules is necessary [see 18].  Specifically, the following \nresearch questions are addressed: \n1. Are there significant differences in measured \u03b415N values of OM between methods?  \n2. Does capsule type effect measured \u03b415N values? \n3. Does acid treatment method influence environmental interpretation of measured \u03b415N \nvalues? \n \nSample materials and Preparation Methods \nSample materials \nA recent comprehensive study into the effects of acid treatment methods on OC in OM of \ndifferent sample materials showed significant differences in C\/N and \u03b413C of sample \nmaterials that were prepared in different ways [18]. As a follow on from this study, we \nselected 3 sample materials for this study from those previously analysed which represent \ndifferent environments and which showed considerably different treatment effects for C\/N \nand \u03b413C values between them. These samples are BROC, SOILB and TYC (a plant, a \nmodern soil and an ancient lake sediment, see Table 1). As these sample materials represent \nthree very different environments, and hence different amounts and composition of OM (e.g. \nterrestrial, freshwater, marine, plant or animal; modern or ancient), and show differences in \nC\/N and \u03b413C between acid treatment methods [e.g. 18], \u03b415N might also be expected to be \nbiased by acid treatment. All sample materials were freeze dried and freeze milled to a flour \n(grain size \u2264 63\u03bcm) prior to analysis. None of these sample materials contain an IC \ncomponent (so we were able to compare untreated with treated sample aliquots). \n \nTable 1: Description of sample materials. 1International organic soil standard from LECO \ncorporation (part no. 502 \u2013 308). 2Internal NIGL laboratory standard. 3Measured on untreated \nsample material. Values are calibrated to V-PDB against international standards NBS-18 and \nNBS-19, and crossed checked with NBS-22.  \n \n \nSample Preparation Methods \nPrior to sample preparation, all sub-sampling equipment and glassware were thoroughly \nwashed in 1% nitric acid, rinsed in deionised water, followed by a wash in 2% neutracon\u00ae \nsolution (DECON Laboratories Ltd., UK), a final deionised water rinse and then fired at \n550oC for 3 hours. Ag capsules were fired at 550oC for 3 hours prior to use. HCl was the only \nreagent selected for removing IC, because it produced more coherent \uf06413C and C\/N data \nwithin and between methods than 6% H2SO3 and 6% H3PO4 [see 18]. Two strengths of HCl \nwere tested, 5% w\/w and 20% w\/w, based on findings in [18]. Sample materials were \nprepared as follows: \n \nUntreated samples: Samples were weighed directly into Sn capsules.  \nCapsule method: Samples were weighed into open Ag capsules, transferred to a metal tray on \na hotplate and 10 \u03bcL of distilled water was added to moisten the samples. After moistening, \n10 \u03bcL of the chosen acid reagent was added to the cold sample before the hotplate \ntemperature was slowly increased to ~50oC. Additional acid was then added in steps of 10 \u03bcL, \n20 \u03bcL, 30 \u03bcL, 50 \u03bcL and 100 \u03bcL, followed by a final 200 \u03bcL, without allowing the sample to \ndry out between additions.  \nRinse method: Sample material was mixed with excess acid in a beaker and allowed to stand \nfor 24 hours. The beaker was topped up to 500 mls with deionised water and the sample \nmaterial allowed to settle for a further 24 hours. Once settled, the supernatant was decanted, \nensuring minimal disturbance of the remaining material, and the beaker then topped up again \nto 500 mls with deionised water. Dilution was repeated 3 times in total with an overall \nminimum of 1200 mls of deionised water used. After the final decanting, the excess water (50 \n\u2013 100 mls) was allowed to evaporate off in a drying oven at ~50oC, and the sample \ntransferred to a Sn capsule.  \n \nThe capsule method uses Ag capsules, because they are resistant to acid attack whereas Sn \ncapsules disintegrate under acidification, especially with HCl. Unlike Sn, however, Ag does \nnot oxidise exothermally in the elemental analyser, so that sample combustion temperatures \nin Ag are lower than in Sn. We therefore also analysed samples with their Ag capsules further \nwrapped in tin (Ag+Sn) to test whether this significantly affected \u03b415N values. The rinse \nmethod traditionally uses Sn capsules, and these were replicated by wrapping in silver \n(Sn+Ag). All treatments were performed in triplicate. \n \nAnalytical Methods \nNitrogen isotope analyses were performed using an elemental analyser linked to an isotope \nratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Samples were loaded into an autosampler (Costech Zero \nBlank, Costech Analytical Technologies, Valencia, USA) and dropped into a 1.6 mL sec-1 \nstream of helium in a FlashEA 1112 elemental analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, \nGermany). The combustion column contained copper oxide and silvered cobaltous oxide at \n900oC, and combustion products were cleaned of oxygen and nitrogen oxides by passage \nthrough copper at 680 oC, and of water and carbon dioxide by passage through magnesium \nperchlorate and carbosorb before passage through the GC column (chemicals supplied by \nElemental Microanalysis, Okehampton, England and Pelican Scientific, Stockport, England). \nThe helium stream with sample N2 was led via a Conflo III interface to a Delta+XL mass \nspectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) for determination of the 15N\/14N \nratio. In order that all treatments of a particular sample material could be analysed in a single \nrun, correction of the measured sample 15N\/14N ratios to \uf06415N values was not based on \ncomparison with internal standard samples (the normal procedure) but rather on comparison \nwith a reference gas whose \uf06415N value versus atmospheric N2 had been determined in \nseparate runs. The quoted \uf06415N values are therefore correct relative to one another for the \nsame sample material, but only approximately correct in absolute terms versus atmospheric \nN2. Limits on analytical precision are mainly determined by conditions of combustion and \nchromatography in the elemental analyser. For organic materials containing a few %N (e.g. \nBROC) within-run precision for \uf06415N is better than 0.3\u2030 (1 SD for n = 10 samples). \nMeasurements of background C and N concentrations from capsules and acid reagents were \nbelow instrument detection limits suggesting contamination did not contribute to variability \nwithin our results [18]. \n \nData Analysis \nAll data are plotted as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (1\u03c3). Our data were analysed by One-Way \nANOVA using Minitab 15.0 (MINITAB Inc. 2007). Data were tested for normality using an \nAnderson-Darling normality test (all p-values > 0.05) and homogeneity of variances using a \nBartlett\u2019s Test (assumes normality within each factor level) and Levene\u2019s Test (does not \nassume normality within each factor level) [50, 51]. For our data, the p-value for the Bartlett \nand Levene tests were all above 0.05 indicating the variances are the same for each factor. \nThese tests validate the use of ANOVA on our data. We test the null hypothesis that there is \nno significant difference in measured \u03b415N values between treatment methods, capsule type \nand acid reagent strength (i.e. within method variability). The results for C\/N and \u03b4 13C have \nbeen previously reported [18] and were measured on different sample aliquots than those for \n\u03b4 15N. \n \nResults \nResults for \u03b4 15N for SOILB, BROC and TYC are presented in Figures 1A-C and are reported \nas mean \u00b1 standard deviation (Table 2), alongside previously reported C\/N and \u03b413C [see 18]. \nResults from the one-way ANOVA are presented in Table 3. There is a statistically \nsignificant difference between pre-analysis acid treatment methods, and within and between \nsample materials (Table 3) that is significantly greater than instrument precision (~0.3 \u2030).  In \nSOILB and TYC, measured values of \u03b4 15N in acid treated are lower than for untreated \nsamples (Figures 1A and 1C; Table 3). For SOILB, the precision of \u03b415N determinations was \nbetter for untreated and rinse method samples than for capsule method samples (value \nrepresented graphically by horizontal grey bars on Figure 1A). In TYC precision was \nmarginally better for acid treated samples than for untreated samples (untreated sample in the \nAg capsule significantly influenced this; see Figure 1C). We notice a slight depletion in \u03b413C \nand lower C\/N in SOILB, with a relatively depleted \u03b415N (to untreated samples). In TYC, the \nrinse method show enriched \u03b413C and higher C\/N values, concomitant with a relatively \ndepleted \u03b415N. \n \nIn BROC, the measured \u03b415N values were generally better for acid treated samples than for \nuntreated samples (value represented graphically by horizontal grey bars on Figure 1B), \nthough the rinse method samples produced the lowest \u03b415N values of all methods for this \nmaterial. This poor sample precision contributed to no statistical differences being detected \nbetween untreated and acid treated sample means. However a significant difference between \ndata in the capsule and rinse methods of ~ 1.2 \u2030 exists (Figure 1B), with the rinse method \ndata showing relatively higher \u03b415N, concomitant with depleted \u03b413C and higher C\/N relative \nto known values [18].  \n \nComparisons of results within the same method but combusted in different capsules showed \nsignificant differences (Table 3). In particular, untreated samples analysed only in Ag \ncapsules showed significantly lower results in all materials (see unfilled circles in Figures 1A \n\u2013 1C). We note, in the capsule method, there was no common trend in data for samples \nfurther wrapped with a Sn capsule, though for TYC \u03b415N were depleted by ~0.5 \u2030 relative to \nother samples within the capsule method. For the rinse method, across all sample materials, \nsamples further wrapped in an Ag capsules showed higher \u03b415N values of between 0.4 \u2013 \n0.8 \u2030. \n \nFigure 1a: SOILB C\/N, \u03b413C and \u03b415N values for each method and acid.

Data were tested at the 0.05 significance level. \n \nDiscussion \n \nMethodological differences in \u03b415N \n \nAs reported for C\/N and \u03b413C data [18], the measured \u03b415N values show evidence of \nsignificant within (affect of acid reagent strength and capsule type) and between (untreated \nversus capsule method versus rinse method) method differences. Across all sample materials, \nthe differences in sample data between methods (up to ~1.5 \u2030) are significantly greater than \nthe instrument precision (~ 0.3 \u2030). The untreated method is the most common approach in \nthe literature [e.g. 4, 22], though simultaneous \uf06413C and \uf06415N measurements (\u201cdual-mode\u201d \nanalysis), which require acid removal of carbonate, are increasingly common [e.g. 4, 23, 24, \n34]. Our results show significant differences in measured \uf06415N value between acid treatment \nmethods and within untreated samples (Figures 1A-C). For example, data for SOILB and \nTYC from acid pre-treated samples were significantly different from untreated by up to \n~1.5 \u2030, with the overall range in the untreated method ~0.5 \u2030 (excluding the samples \ncombusted only in Ag capsules). In the rinse method, \uf06415N may be biased by the loss of \nsoluble organic and\/or inorganic N species [e.g. 35, 36], or very fine particles [e.g. 14, 18; 36, \n37, 38, 39]. For example, the loss of 14N rich species (e.g. protein; ammonium) would \nincrease the \u03b415N value [e.g. 35]. This suggests problems of reliability on \uf06415N measurements, \nparticularly from acid treated samples. This has implications for the applicability of any one \nmethod in a short or long core, where type, amount and nature of OM can vary significantly, \nand on modern organic materials. \n \nThese findings partially agree with Kennedy [22] and Fernandes and Krull [28], who find that \nthe precision of acid treated samples was equal to or less than that of untreated samples. \nInterestingly, Kennedy et al [22] find no significant difference between results, and suggest \nthat measurements of \u03b415N on acid treated samples as an appropriate methodology whereas \nFernandes and Krull [28] report differences of up to 2 \u2030 (offsets due to volatilisation \n(capsule method) and solubilisation (rinse method)), and suggest measurement on untreated \nmaterial. Such variability suggests the different organic chemical composition of sample \nmaterials from different environments can influence the reliability of isotopic C and N values \nobtained using these acid treatment procedures necessitating an understanding of the \ncomplexities of sample OM within and between environments [18, 28]. This has significant \ninterpretative implications for \u03b415N in sedimentary records. Published studies have reported \n\u03b415N data ranges in the order of ~1 \u2013 5 \u2030, on surface samples, short cores [e.g. 7, 20, 23, 40, \n41], and long cores [e.g. 16, 24, 32, 33, 42, 43]. The differences reported here for BROC (~ \n0.1 \u2013 1.2 \u2030), SOILB (~ 0.2 \u2013 1.3 \u2030) and TYC (~ 0.8 \u2013 1.6 \u2030) are only a function of pre-\nanalysis acid treatment (i.e. an artefact), and therefore have the potential to significantly \ninfluence environmental interpretation of the data. Where different sample preparations (e.g. \nuntreated versus acid treated) or analytical methods (e.g. \u201csingle\u201d versus \u201cdual\u201d mode isotope \nanalysis) are followed, this will preclude the comparison of \u03b415N from different down-core \nrecords. \n \nEffect of Capsule type \n \nIt has been shown that there is a systematic depletion in \u03b413C in aquatic material within the \ncapsule method for samples further wrapped in Sn (Ag+Sn)[18]. We therefore test whether \ncapsule type influenced measured \u03b415N results. For all sample materials, untreated sample \naliquots wrapped only in an Ag capsule showed significantly lower \u03b415N values in \ncomparison to all other untreated sample aliquots (unfilled circles on Figures 1A \u2013 C). The \nabsence of Sn in the combustion process has an influence on the overall combustion \ntemperature as there is no additional exothermal heat supply through the Sn oxidative \nreaction. This, combined with the 900oC combustion temperature, which is lower than \ntraditionally used in C\/N and \uf06413C analysis of OM (~ \u2265 1000oC), likely has a direct influence \non the ease with which labile and recalcitrant components of the sample materials react. The \npresence of Sn appeared to have less marked influence on results for acid treated samples, but \nthis might be due to the acidification process obscuring differences between labile and \nrecalcitrant components [18, 28].  \n \nAlongside the potential for offsets in elemental and isotopic C and N due to the acid reagent \nand\/or method followed, it appears that the capsule material in which the sample is \ncombusted, may also influence data distribution. This has implications for the comparison of \ndata between methods, and between laboratories (because the rinse method uses Sn capsules \nand the capsule method Ag capsules) in addition to the likelihood for offsets linked to the \ntype, amount and nature of OM [28].   \n \n Coupled offsets in \u03b413C and \u03b415N   \n \nA comparison of \u03b413C and \u03b415N within and between methods clearly indicates that method \ninduced alterations of the sample OM can influence measured \u03b413C and \u03b415N values in a \ndisproportionate and non-linear fashion. \u03b413C and \u03b415N shifts are not consistent or in the same \ndirection across the methods in any one material analysed (Figures 1A-C). For BROC, \nrelative to untreated samples, the capsule method showed a slight enrichment in \u03b413C of \n~0.2 \u2030 (and slight increase in C\/N value) coupled with a depletion in \u03b415N of ~0.6 \u2030 \nrelative to untreated. This is in contrast to the results in the rinse method, which show a \ndepletion in \u03b413C of ~1.2 \u2030 (C\/N value increased by ~3 \u2013 6), and an enrichment in \u03b415N of \n~0.7 \u2030 relative to untreated. For the capsule method, the results suggest a loss of 15N \nenriched compounds and no significant change in \u03b413C but for the rinse method, a loss of 13C \nenriched compounds, but no differential loss of 15N compounds (which is not too dissimilar \nto untreated values). \n \nThe differential loss of 15N rich compounds has previously been reported from pre-analysis \nacid treatment methods [e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4], through solubilisation or volatilisation [e.g. 18, 26, 27, \n28, 44]. It has been proposed that losses or alterations to proteins, nucleic and amino-acids \nare the primary cause [e.g. 26, 44]. These compounds also tend to be relatively deficient in \n13C, suggesting the trends noted in BROC in the rinse method are from these nitrogenous \ncompounds with losses greater than for the capsule method. Fernandes and Krull [28] also \nreported greater losses in the rinse method by at least double. The capsule method showed a \ndepleted \u03b415N signature, but no significant change in \u03b413C from known values. This clearly \nindicates that both \u03b413C and \u03b415N can be significantly affected by acid preparation method, \nbut more importantly can also vary independently of one another (i.e. in significantly \ndifferent proportions). The different types of N (and C) within a sample (organic and \ninorganic, and there relative proportions) can respond variably suggesting that the magnitude \nof the method affect will vary considerably between sample materials (i.e. different \nenvironments representing different OM provenance and composition). We therefore warn of \nthe dangers of using \u2018dual-mode\u2019 analysis without a robust understanding of sample OM in \nthe context of pre-analysis acid treatment effects on N (and C). Additionally, where sample \nsize of C and N of OM is small, acid treatment induced alterations of OM can promote less \nreliable data which further undermines a \u201cdual-mode\u201d analysis approach [e.g. 18]. Sample \nmineralogy may also influence the precision of C and N data [e.g. 28]. \n\uf020\n\uf06413C and \uf06415N cross-plots \n \nCross plots of \u03b413C and \u03b415N have been used to indicate OM provenance [e.g. 7, 45] in a \nsimilar fashion to C\/N and \u03b413C [e.g. 46, 47, 48], though the extent to which acid treatment \nmethod could influence the distribution of data on these plots has not been discussed. Brodie \net al [18] reported this method bias on C\/N and \u03b413C cross-plots, illustrating the method and \nacid used could dictate the spread of data and subsequent environmental interpretation. This \nprovides justification for examining \u03b413C against \u03b415N. Our \u03b413C and \u03b415N cross-plots for each \nmaterial similarly illustrate this bias (Figure 2). This may consequently preclude a robust \ninterpretation, especially in environments where the amount, type and nature of OM varies \nand, there is more than one OM end member (i.e. rivers, estuaries, lakes, marine \nenvironments).  \n \nFigure 2: Bi-plots of \u03b413C and \u03b415N values of SOILB (A), BROC (B) and TYC (C) data. The \nfilled circle represents untreated samples; the unfilled circle represents rinse method samples \nand; the filled triangle capsule method samples. Error bars represent the standard deviation \n(1\u03c3) of triplicate treatments for \uf06413C and \uf06415N. As discussed, samples analysed in Ag \ncapsules only have been discarded from further comparison and are not represented in these \nplots. \n \nInorganic Nitrogen \n \nAn important assumption underpinning the interpretation of %N, C\/N and \u03b415N values of OM \nis that all sample N is OM bound, and that any IN component is insignificant in terms of error \non data and subsequent interpretation [e.g. 21]. However, it is not common place to quantify \nIN of sample materials, despite the potential influence on organic %N and C\/N values \nespecially in samples containing low OC [19, 20, 21, 31, 32, 49]. For example, Schubert and \nCalvert [20] reported C\/N values of Arctic Ocean surface sediments from total N ranging \nfrom 4 \u2013 8, and from organic N from 8 \u2013 15. This represents a clear shift in interpretation \nfrom OM dominated by aquatic biomass to OM with an increasing terrestrially sourced \ncomponent. Despite this, measurements for %N and \u03b415N are commonly reported, whether on \ntreated or untreated samples.  \n \nIn lieu of IN quantification, it has been proposed that the IN content can be estimated through \na regression of %C and %N values assuming a  perfect linear relationship and using the \ncalculated r2 value. The estimation of IN content as a percentage deviation from that perfect \nlinear relationship is calculated from (1 \u2013 r2) x 100 [e.g. 7, 19, 45]. The approach of Muller \n[19], Meyers [45] and Hu et al [7] is the regression of a number of samples within a large \nsystem (e.g. lacustrine and estuarine surface samples), whereas our approach is sample \nspecific (i.e. one sample rather than numerous spatial distributed samples). We follow this IN \nestimation method for our analysed sample materials by linearly regressing data from all \nmethods for each material (providing one r2 statistic for the data \u2013 the \u201cbest fit\u201d) and then \nbootstrapping the data (i.e. computing 2000 iterations of the linear regression model on the \ndata to assess the distribution of the r2 statistic across the data set; this allows an assessment \nof the influence of acid treatment method on the spread of the data relative to the \u201cbest fit\u201d). \nIf acid treatment method has little to no influence on the spread of the %C and %N data, there \nshould be little deviation from the \u201cbest fit\u201d scenario, and hence little to no change in the \nestimation of IN.  \n \nBased on our bootstrapped r2 estimates, and subsequent calculation of percentage IN, ~60 \u2013 \n86% of BROC, ~27 \u2013 49% of SOILB and ~ 55 \u2013 75% of TYC may be attributed to IN (i.e. \nvariation in %N explained by the regression model). The spread of data shown in Figures 3A-\nC represents i) method bias; and ii) the true C and N distribution, and indicates a limitation to \nthe interpretation of C\/N values. These estimation ranges for IN content point toward an \nemergent linearity within our sample data, suggesting that the data be non-normally \ndistributed either by nature, or by bias due to acid treatment method. This violates the key \nassumption of normality in the linear regression model and suggests an analysis of numerous \nspatially distributed samples [e.g. 7, 19] will propagate significant (but unrecognised) bias \nonto the interpretation of %C, %N and C\/N values. \n \nThe overall statistical approach  is misleading, and assumes i) a dependence of %N on %C in \nsample OM within and between environments; ii) a systematic and proportional co-variability \nof both pools within sample OM during sample pre-treatment and; iii) the offsets from this \nare related to intrinsically non-linear IN processes. In the context of different formation, \ntransportation and diagenesis processes, across significantly different environments, an \nemergent linearity from a complex C and N system is unlikely to be real, particularly across \ndiverse systems where the OM composition and structure varies. There is no apparent \nmechanism promoting linearity of C and N in a specific sample or indeed in a system, \nsuggesting that the emergent linearity reported here can be substantially dictated by method. \nIn addition, the disproportionate and non-systematic variability in elemental C and N \nconcentrations previously reported [18], suggests that this procedure of estimation is further \nundermined, even if a non-linear relationship is assumed (which would likely lead to \nsignificantly greater bias). The idea that the emergent linearity can be used to derive an \nunderstanding of the non-linear IN pool based on the deviation from the presumed perfect \nlinear relationship is incorrect, especially in the context of a down-core profile. Further, it \ndoes not reliably improve the understanding of the sample OM. Even if the prescribed linear \nfit was correct, the assumptions made are seriously flawed. We conclude that the application \nof this statistical technique for IN estimation, in the context of method bias and the \ncomplexity of C and N in the environment, is an aberration and should be abhorred. We \nrecommend that IN be quantified following an organic N digestion process [e.g. KOBr-KOH: \n20, 21]. \n \nFigure3a: Bi-plot of %C and %N values of SOILB data for untreated (diamond); capsule \n(square) and; rinse methods (circle). \n \nFigure 3b: Bi-plot of %C and %N values of BROC data for untreated (diamond); capsule \n(square) and; rinse methods (circle). \n \nFigure 3c: Bi-plot of %C and %N values of TYC data for capsule (square) and rinse methods \n(circle). \n \nSummary and Recommendations \n1. Our results show clear evidence for significant differences in measured \u03b415N values \nbetween pre-analysis acid treatment methods and between untreated samples. The bias is \nof the order of ~ 1.5 \u2030. \n2. Differences between \u03b413C and \u03b415N on acid treated samples are non-linear and \ndisproportionate. This implies that the type, amount and nature of OM, and its potential \nalteration during pre-analysis acid treatment methods, is an important factor underpinning \nthe reliable determination of C\/N, \u03b413C and \u03b415N of sample OM. Importantly, these offsets \ncan significantly undermine environmental interpretation of \u03b415N values. \n3. Capsule type can have a significant influence on the reliability of \u03b415N in sample OM. \nUntreated samples combusted only in Ag capsules particularly produce aberrant results \n(exclusive of bias linked to acidification). We therefore recommend further wrapping \ncapsule method samples (which traditionally only use Ag capsules) in Sn capsules after \nacid treatment as this increases the combustion temperature in the reactor column. This is \nrecommended with the codicil that the affect of acidification could obscure the affect of \nthe capsule. \n4. We do not recommend \u201cdual-mode analysis\u201d of sample materials due to these \nunpredictable, non-linear differences, which suggest its inapplicability. Samples should \nbe processed and analysed for C and N on separate aliquots, in the knowledge of the \npotential for acid induced offsets. It should be noted that measurement of N on untreated \nsamples does not guarantee reliable results. \n5. The estimation procedure used for IN, namely linear regression, is seriously flawed, and \nprovides no sensible or reliable information on the influence of IN on measured %N (and \nhence influence on C\/N values) or \u03b415N values of OM. IN should therefore be quantified \non separate sample aliquots, and corrected for [e.g. 20, 21]. \n \nAcknowledgments \nCRB acknowledges support from the NERC through PhD studentship NE\/F007264\/1 and \nNERC Stable Isotope Facility Grant IP\/1165\/0510 (to JML).
