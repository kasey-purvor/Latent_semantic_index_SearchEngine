Introduction\nIn his seminal paper Turing [43] considered a system of two reacting and diffusing chemicals (which he\ntermed morphogens) and demonstrated the surprising phenomenon of diffusion-driven instability. That is,\nhe showed that it was possible for a spatially uniform steady state, linearly stable in the absence of diffusion,\nto be driven unstable by the presence of diffusion and evolve to a spatially non-uniform steady state. Reaction-\ndiffusion models of this type have been studied in the context of pattern formation in hydra (Geirer and Mein-\nhardt, [13]), sequential pattern formation in vertebrates (Meinhardt, [26]), animal coat markings (Murray,\n[31]), and shell pigmentation patterns (Meinhardt, [27]).

Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119 101Most of the above applications of Turing theory have assumed fixed domains. In the context of develop-\nmental biology, the tacit assumption is that the pattern forming processes occur on a different timescale to\ndomain growth. However, it has been shown that in some cases this is not true and that domain growth\ncan play a very important role in pattern formation and selection [17,9,34].\nThe rapid recent developments in computational power have given a new impetus to the application of\nnovel numerical techniques to a wide variety of non-traditional mathematical fields. This is clearly observed\nin the life sciences, especially in mathematical biology and bio-medicine. With this comes the need to\nunderstand the basis of these numerical methods and the effects of mesh structure on numerical solutions.\nMost, if not all, numerical methods are based locally on mesh elements. For example, the centred finite\ndifference scheme is based on a five-point stencil [29]. The finite element method [14] is element based,\nwhere the structure of the mesh could be as simple as segments, triangles, rectangles or as complex as tet-\nrahedrons in one, two and three dimensions, respectively. These are not the only mesh-based numerical\nmethods. The spectral method [5] and the finite volume scheme [29] are some of the numerical schemes\nwhich are mesh-dependent.\nIn this paper we concentrate on the most widely used finite difference and finite element methods. We are\ninterested in numerical solutions of reaction-diffusion systems on fixed and continuously deforming domains.\nWe investigate the role of mesh structure and regularity on the observed numerically computed solutions and\nillustrate our results by focusing on one particular well-known reaction-diffusion model.\nThe most widely used numerical method is the centred finite difference scheme mainly because it is compu-\ntationally easy to implement and handles boundary conditions in a straightforward way. In most cases a reg-\nular uniform mesh is used on regular domains. For Turing reaction-diffusion models, illustrations of the use of\nsuch schemes to numerically compute solutions can be found in, for example, the papers by Murray [31],\nKondo and Asai [17], Painter et al. [34], Barrio et al. [3,4], Crampin et al. [9] and more recently Plaza et al. [36].\nOn the other hand, the finite element method is more complicated to implement than the finite difference\nscheme. The basis of the finite element method involves a weak variational formulation of the partial differ-\nential equation system whereby the solution is sought in a finite-dimensional subspace. All computations are\nthen restricted to local elements where local matrices are computed and then assembled into global matrices.\nThe formulation is independent of the structure of the mesh although the mesh has to satisfy some criteria\n(see, for example, Reddy [37], Johnson [14], Morton [28] for specific details). Applications of finite elements\nto reaction-diffusion systems in developmental biology can be found, for example, in papers by Chaplain\net al. [7], Sekimura et al. [40], Madzvamuse [25,19], Madzvamuse et al. [23,24,22,21,20], Nijhout et al. [33],\nZheng et al. [44], and Cristini et al. [12].\nThe application of spectral methods to reaction-diffusion systems is not as widely used as the aforemen-\ntioned methods. However, recently Kassam and Trefethen [15,16] have proposed a modified Exponential Time\nDifferencing fourth-order Runge-Kutta (ETDRK4) method for solving stiff nonlinear partial differential equa-\ntions of which reaction-diffusion systems are a particular case. The ETDRK4 scheme was found to be the best\nscheme for providing accurate stable solutions in a fast and efficient way on fixed domains. To our knowledge,\nthis scheme has not been extended for application to spatially irregular complicated fixed, or sometimes grow-\ning domains. For further details on this method, see, for example, the papers by Kassam and Trefethen [15,16],\nCox and Matthews [8], and Tadmor [42].\nThe aim of this paper is to illustrate through numerical solutions the role of mesh structure on solutions of\nreaction-diffusion equations on continuously deforming domains for the ADI finite difference scheme. It is\nknown, though not well documented, that for nonlinear partial differential equations, the structure of the lat-\ntice (mesh elements) could greatly affect numerical solutions for finite difference schemes on fixed domains. We\nwill illustrate computationally that domain growth coupled with grid-point velocity on a uniform square mesh\nstabilises certain patterns which are very sensitive to any kind of perturbation in mesh structure. The grid-\npoint velocity and therefore the resolution of the computational domain plays an important role in the bifur-\ncation process. The results of our numerical experiments will highlight the need to: (a) develop a bifurcation\ntheoretical framework on continuously deforming domains and (b) carry out a detailed numerical analysis, for\nexample, on artificial numerical diffusion which depends on the mesh structure and the domain growth. Both\nof these research threads are the focus of our current research studies.\n102 A. Madzvamuse, P.K. Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119This paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we present the general reaction-diffusion model equations\non a continuously deforming domain, and Section 3 deals with the numerical methods that we apply to solve\nthese equations. Computational results illustrating the role of mesh structure are presented in Sections 4 and 5\non fixed and growing domains, respectively. Lastly we present our conclusions in Section 6.\n2. Model equations\nConsider the generalised nondimensional reaction-diffusion system of two chemical concentrations u and v\non a continuously deforming domain (Crampin [10], Madzvamuse [25]):ut \u00fer:\u00f0au\u00de \u00bc r2u\u00fe cf \u00f0u; v\u00de; \u00f02:1\u00de\nvt \u00fer:\u00f0av\u00de \u00bc dr2v\u00fe cg\u00f0u; v\u00de in X\u00f0t\u00de; \u00f02:2\u00dewith X(t) representing a time-dependent domain. Here a represents the field flow velocity. f(u,v) and g(u,v)\nrepresent reaction kinetics, d is a constant ratio of the diffusion coefficients and c is a scaling parameter. Initial\nconditions are prescribed as small random perturbations around the uniform steady state if it exists. Boundary\nconditions can either be periodic, zero-flux (homogeneous Neumann) or mixed. Zero-flux boundary condi-\ntions are appropriate for the case of an impermeable membrane, for example, or where we wish to explore\nself-organising processes. Periodic boundary conditions can represent, for example, the case of a closed,\ncylindrical domain.\nMost studies of reaction-diffusion equations assume fixed regular domains. To consider a time-depen-\ndent domain, it is logical to try to transform the model equations (2.1) and (2.2) from a continuously\ndeforming domain to a fixed domain where appropriate numerical schemes have already been developed\nand tested. One possible way to do this is to use Lagrangian transformations (Baines, [1]). This type of\nsimplification yields partial differential equations with time-dependent coefficients on a fixed domain. The\ncontinuously deforming domain is transformed at each time to a fixed domain. Below we illustrate how\nthis can be achieved.2.1. Lagrangian transformations\nIn this section we look at the partial differential equations on continuously deforming domains from a\nLagrangian point of view (see, for example, Baines, [1]). A transformation between a moving grid to a fixed\ngrid is sought. Let n and g be fixed cartesian coordinates such thatx \u00bc x^\u00f0n; g; s\u00de; y \u00bc y^\u00f0n; g; s\u00de and t \u00bc s:\nAs t varies, the coordinates x and y change position with time. These positions are then mapped or trans-\nformed to a fixed position given by the n and g coordinates. Now under this transformation, suppose u is\nmapped into the new function defined as u\u00f0x; y; t\u00de \u00bc u^\u00f0n; g; s\u00de. We can compute the time-derivative using\nthe principle of differentiation \u2018\u2018following the motion\u2019\u2019u^s \u00bc ut \u00fe uxx^s \u00fe uyy^s \u00bc ut \u00fe aru; \u00f02:3\u00de\nwhereux \u00bc u^nnx \u00fe u^ggx; uy \u00bc u^nny \u00fe u^ggy and a \u00bc \u00f0x^s; y^s\u00deT: \u00f02:4\u00de\nFrom these equations we can derive the second partial derivativesuxx \u00bc u^nnn2x \u00fe u^nnxx \u00fe u^ggg2x \u00fe u^ggxx; \u00f02:5\u00de\nuyy \u00bc u^nnn2y \u00fe u^nnyy \u00fe u^ggg2y \u00fe u^ggyy : \u00f02:6\u00deHence the equation for u can be written as follows:u^s \u0002 a:ru\u00fe a:ru\u00fe \u00f0r:a\u00deu^ \u00bc u^nn\u00f0n2x \u00fe n2y\u00de \u00fe u^n\u00f0nxx \u00fe nyy\u00de \u00fe u^gg\u00f0g2x \u00fe g2y\u00de \u00fe u^g\u00f0gxx \u00fe gyy\u00de \u00fe cf \u00f0u^; v^\u00de\nThat is\nA.

One possible form of sim-\nplification is to consider that domain growth is uniform and isotropic. By isotropic we mean that the boundary\ncurve deforms continuously at the same rate in all directions at all times. Let us consider the one-dimensional\ncase and assume that domain growth is uniform and isotropic defined as follows:x^ \u00bc q\u00f0t\u00deX 0\u00f0n\u00de \u00bc q\u00f0t\u00den; n 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0003: \u00f02:11\u00de\nThe function q(t) represents how the domain grows.

Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) are derived on an arbitrary continuously\ngrowing domain. Pattern selection does not only depend on the growth of the domain but also on its shape, for\nexample, and the selection process can be curvature dependent. Plaza et al. [36] derived reaction-diffusion sys-\ntems on a parametrized growing domain. Their equations included the rate of domain growth together with\ndefinitions of the curved boundaries. Eqs. (2.16), (2.17), (2.22) and (2.23) are particular cases of their gener-\nalised model equations. These equations were also derived independently by Crampin et al. [9].\n3. Numerical methods\n3.1. Alternating-direction implicit scheme\nAn Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) finite difference scheme is applied to solve the transformed system\nof equations (2.22) and (2.23) on a fixed domain at each time step. This scheme was first proposed by Peac-\neman and Rachford to model oil reservoirs [29]. The ADI is often thought of as an iterative linear solver for\nthe five-point finite difference stencils on a rectangular grid (this is the original meaning used in the early\npapers by Peaceman and Rachford [35] for example). On the other hand, if iterated to convergence it merely\nbecomes a split-step difference scheme and this is how we apply it in this paper. The ADI is characterized as\nfollows: the integration is explicit in one direction and implicit in the other direction for one half-timestep, and\nthe order is reversed for the other half-timestep. Details of how the ADI scheme is applied to reaction-diffu-\nsion systems can be found in papers by Crampin [10], Crampin et al. [9,11] and Painter et al. [34]. The ADI\nscheme is unconditionally stable, however in order to satisfy the conditions for the maximum principle the\nfollowing bound needs to be met:max\nDt\n\u00f0Dx\u00de2 ;\nDt\n\u00f0Dy\u00de2\n\u0002 \u0003\n6 1:The advantage of this scheme is that it gives rise to a tridiagonal form of the matrices. The tridiagonal system\nof equations can be solved fast and efficiently by using the Thomas algorithm [29]. The scheme is second order\naccurate in both time and space.\n3.2. Moving grid finite element method\nUnlike the finite difference scheme which is applied to the transformed equations, the moving grid finite\nelement method is applied to the original equations (2.1) and (2.2) on a continuously deforming domain\nX(t). The method solves the model equations by use of piece-wise linear bases functions on an arbitrary contin-\nuously deforming domain. Here, an unstructured triangular mesh is used in the moving grid finite element sim-\nulations. The mesh is generated by a delaunay mesh generator package (Mu\u00a8ller et al. [30]). The spatial\ndiscretization gives rise to a semi\u2013discrete system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We use a second\nA. Madzvamuse, P.K. Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119 105order semi-implicit backward differentiation formula to discretise the ordinary differential equations in time.\nWe shall abbreviate this method: the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme, to reflect the fact that we use moving grid\nfinite elements in space and a second order semi-implicit backward differentiation formula in time. Details\non implementation, stability and accuracy of the method can be found in the following papers: Madzvamuse\n[25,19], and Madzvamuse et al. [22,20]. The spatial discretisation gives rise to large sparse, symmetric and posi-\ntive definite systems which are solved efficiently by using the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method\n(Saad [39]).\nIt must be noted that it is also possible to use the transformed systems of equations (2.7)\u2013(2.10) coupled\nwith a time-dependent moving mesh equation which makes it possible to consider a more complicated domain\ngrowth (Cao et al. [6]).\n4. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional fixed domains\nThis section aims to illustrate the point that the ADI and MGFEM-2SBDF schemes yield similar results in\nthe absence of domain growth for zero-flux and periodic boundary conditions. In particular, we will highlight\nthat for the ADI scheme the structure of the mesh can influence the selection of the numerical solution. In all\nour solutions we only show results corresponding to chemical concentration u, those of v are 180\u0003 out of phase\nto those of u. The colouration (shading) in figures for the ADI scheme is automatically generated in MatLab\nwhile those for the MGFEM scheme shading is done per triangular element. For further details see Madzv-\namuse et al. [25].\nLet us take q\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 in equations (2.22) and (2.23) implying no domain growth.

Let the timestep be taken as Dt \u00bc 10\u00022 and compute solutions to final time, say, tF \u00bc 5. Initial conditions\nare taken as small random perturbations around the homogeneous steady state (1:0; 0:9) and zero-flux bound-\nary conditions are applied.\nThe ADI scheme solves the model equations on a uniform mesh grid given by Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n150\n(Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe MGFEM-2SBDF scheme solves the model equations on an unstructured triangular mesh of approxi-\nmately 2000 nodes and 4000 elements. Fig. 1 illustrates solutions corresponding to the ADI scheme (left),\nand the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme (right). The values of c are 114, 1000 and 5000 for the first, second and third\nrows respectively. The two schemes produce qualitatively similar solutions on fixed domains with zero-flux\nboundary conditions. We have shown in previous studies that the results obtained using the MGFEM scheme\nare independent of the structure of the mesh, regular, irregular or well-refined meshes yield similar results\n(Madzvamuse et al. [19\u201322]). Therefore the number of degrees of freedom quoted above for this scheme\nare simply for illustrative purposes.4.2.

As in experiment 1, we compute solutions using the ADI and MGFEM-2SBDF schemes and com-\npare results. The results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 2. We draw attention to the second row for\nc \u00bc 1000. The solution from the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme is a 90-degree rotation to that obtained from\nthe ADI scheme. This is because of the symmetry of the square domain. For the ADI scheme, this is not\nthe only final pattern observed. If we change the mesh structure from a uniform square mesh to a uniform\nrectangular mesh we obtain different results as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 3 we compute solutions\nto the model equations using the ADI scheme and illustrate the evolution of the approximate numerical solu-\ntions starting with stripe-like initial conditions for various mesh sizes. Numerical and parameter values as in\nFig. 2 and the computations are carried out to final time tF \u00bc 1:0. It can be observed that changing the mesh\nstructure gives rise to different pattern generation sequences. This fact is demonstrated clearly in Fig. 4. Here\nwe are only plotting the transient (left column) and steady state patterns (right column) for different mesh\nstructure at time t \u00bc 1:9 and t \u00bc 2:0 respectively. From numerous computational experiments, the plots on\nthe left column (top and bottom) are transient solutions just before they converge asymptotically to the steady\nstates. The transient solutions evolve with time to either the top-right or the bottom-right inhomogeneous\nsteady state pattern.\nImagine that we fold the square domains on the right column in Fig. 4 around the x-axis to form a cylinder\nwith centre along the x-axis then the seemingly different patterns are identical. Although it seems that different\nmesh sizes give rise to different patterns, these in reality are identical solutions given periodic boundary con-\nditions. Small changes in mesh size introduce noise into the numerical simulations which in turn influence the\nselection of the final pattern. Therefore the ADI and the MGFEM-2SBDF schemes provide qualitatively sim-\nilar results in the absense of domain growth. The fact that for the ADI scheme, changes in the mesh structure\nfrom a uniform square mesh to a uniform rectangular mesh results in different transient solutions, on contin-\nuously deforming domains such changes influence dramatically the bifurcation process of the transient solu-\ntions as illustrated in the next section.\n5. The role of mesh structure in numerical solutions for reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains\nThe aim of this section is to show through numerical simulations that for the ADI scheme changes in the\nmesh structure influence dramatically the bifurcation process of patterns on growing domains due to the grid-\npoint velocity of the mesh and the resolution of the computational continuously deforming domain. Unlike\nthe ADI scheme, the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme does not suffer from such bias due to the nature of its finite\nelement formulation which is independent of the mesh structure.\nLet us consider a continuously deforming unit square domain \u00bd0; 1\u0003 \u0004 \u00bd0; 1\u0003. Assume that domain growth is\nuniform and isotropic. Also assume that the domain grows exponentially with growth rate function defined by\nq\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ert where r \u00bc 0:002 is the growth rate (Crampin, et al., [10,9]). All our simulations on growing domains\nare computed with the following model parameter values: a \u00bc 0:1, b \u00bc 0:9, c \u00bc 1:0, d \u00bc 0:01. Zero-flux\nboundary conditions are imposed and initial conditions are prescribed as small random perturbations around\nthe uniform steady state (1.0,0.9) obtained on a fixed domain. Transient solutions are computed to final time\ntF \u00bc 850:0, i.e. the unit square domain is allowed to grow to approximately a 5:5\u0004 5:5 square domain. In\norder to compare with previous results in the literature, the ADI scheme solves the transformed system of\nequations (2.16)\u2013(2.23) while the MGFEM scheme solves the non-transformed system of equations (2.1)\nand (2.2). We have shown in previous studies that the MGFEM method can be easily extended to more com-\nplicated irregular continuously deforming domains whose domain growth is prescribed through a specific def-\ninition or defined from experiments (Madzvamuse et al. [19\u201322]). This is contrary to the ADI scheme.\nFig. 3.

We observe the splitting of a single spot into four spots,\nand then sixteen spots and so on as the domain doubles, quadruples, etc. in size. The sequence generated is 1,\n4, 16, \u0005 \u0005 \u0005 which translates to even powers of two, i.e. 20, 22, 24, \u0005 \u0005 \u0005. This same sequence was generated by\nCrampin [10] for identical model and numerical parameter values. The observation then was that the symmet-\nrical phenomenon of this sequence is due to the square domain and the isotropic growth.\nLet us solve the original model equations with identical parameter values but this time using the MGFEM-\n2SBDF scheme on an unstructured mesh. The unit square domain is allowed to deform uniformly and isotrop-\nically as illustrated in Fig. 6. Clearly the sequence differs completely from that shown in Fig. 5. A spot re-ori-\nents into an oblique peanut-like stripe pattern which further splits diagonally into two spots. These further split\ndiagonally into four spots and then eight and so on as the domain grows in size. The sequence generated is 1,\n2, 4, 8, 16, \u0005 \u0005 \u0005 which translates to simply powers of two: 20, 21, 22, 23, . . ..

A uniform square mesh structure was used in the ADI scheme as opposed to an unstructured trian-\ngular mesh for the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme. Qualitatively similar results are obtained for the MGFEM-\n2SBDF scheme if a regular mesh structure is used or if a regular or irregular mesh is further refined (results\nnot shown). The crucial question is why two different numerical methods produce different results for identical\nnumerical and model parameter values?\nInstead of using uniform square mesh elements for the ADI scheme, let the mesh be rectangular defined by\nDx \u00bc 1\n200\nand Dy \u00bc 1\n100\n.

The transient solutions evolve\nfrom a single spot that splits into two and these further split into four etc. The splitting process is still very\nregular, the splitting sequence translates to powers of two, in agreement with the sequence obtained from\nthe MGFEM-2SBDF method. All we have changed is the structure of the mesh. The growing domain is still\nsquare at all times.\nWe investigate the underlying process that accounts for the different transient solutions observed for differ-\nent mesh structures for the ADI method.

Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119on the mesh sizes Dx and Dy. The grid-point velocity on a coarse mesh is different from the grid-point velocity\non a finer mesh and therefore the resolution of the computational domain influences the bifurcation process on\ncontinuously deforming domains. This observation is clearly illustrated in numerical simulations whose results\nare shown in Fig. 8 whereby we solve the model equations using the ADI method with successive mesh refine-\nments. The results should be read column-wise with column 1 representing results with mesh-size Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n30\nshown at times t \u00bc 102, 442, 714, 782 and 850. Column 2: Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n100\nand results are shown at times\nt \u00bc 170, 442, 646, 782 and 850. Column 3: Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n500\nwith results shown at times t \u00bc 170, 340, 748,\n782, and 850. The different times are chosen specifically to illustrate the different dynamics taking place for\ndifferent grid-point velocities. The model parameter values remain unchanged with growth rate r \u00bc 0:002.\nIt can be observed from the first column that a single spot splits into 4, and then 8 and 16 etc. on a coarse\nuniform square mesh Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n30\n. The sequence generated is 1, 4, 8, 16, \u0005 \u0005 \u0005. This sequence differs from that\nillustrated in column 2. Here the sequence observed is 1, 4, 16, \u0005 \u0005 \u0005. Simply by refining the uniform square mesh\nto Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n100\n, we observe different pattern sequences. Column 3 shows a very surprising result when the\nuniform square mesh is further refined to Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n500\n. Although initially the splitting sequence follows that\nof Column 2, the pattern at time 850 is not that of 16 spots but 14 spots. This is due to the slow movement of\nthe grid points. Numerical results on the static domain gives rise to either a 12, 13, 14 or 15 spot pattern\ndepending on how close the initial conditions are to the selected pattern. We have carried out various numer-\nical computations with further uniform square mesh refinement such as Dx \u00bc Dy \u00bc 1\n600\n, 1\n700\nor 1\n1000\n, for example,\nand we have obtained similar results. So far, we carried out simulations on uniform square mesh with refine-\nment. What if the mesh is not square?\nA remarkable result is that if we perturb slightly the mesh structure, say for example, Dx \u00bc 1\n50\nand Dy \u00bc 1\n49\nor\nDx \u00bc 1\n500\nand Dy \u00bc 1\n499\nwe obtain the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,. . . as illustrated in Fig. 9. Here, a rectangular mesh\nstructure is used. The snap-shots are shown at times t = 170, 442, 646, 748 and 850 for columns 1, 2 and 3\nrespectively. Observe that the sequences: 1, 4, 8, 16,. . . and 1, 4, 16,. . . are sub-sequences of the sequence 1,\n2, 4, 8, 16,. . .. It turns out that a uniform rectangular mesh stabilises the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,. . . and not\nthe sub-sequences. Therefore the two sub-sequences are highly unstable to small or large perturbations in\nthe mesh structure. By choosing Dx 6\u00bc Dy we always obtain the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,. . . In Fig. 9 we illustrate\nresults for various mesh sizes. Clearly for the ADI scheme, a square mesh stabilises the selection of different\npatterns depending on whether the mesh is coarse or refined and the grid-point velocity and therefore the res-\nolution of the computational continuously deforming domain plays a crucial role in the bifurcation process.\nBy slightly changing the structure of the mesh from square to rectangles, the sequence of simple powers of two\nis obtained always. These observations arise purely from a computational point of view, and more detailed\nstudy is warranted into the bifurcation theory on continuously deforming domains. One of the aims of this\npaper is to illustrate the need for such theory in order to understand the selection process of the transient pat-\nterns on continuously deforming domains. It must be observed that the 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,. . . sequence can be\nobtained also by taking for example the growth rate in the y-direction to be twice the growth rate in the\nx-direction. For example, taking rx \u00bc 0:001 and ry \u00bc 0:002 with Dx \u00bc Dy yields the same sequence. Although\nwe are taking a square mesh structure, the growth rate overrides the influence of the mesh structure in the\nselection process. The splitting process for this scenario will favour the x-axis rather than the y-axis and\nvice-versa if the growth rates are switched around.\nIn certain cases, we have shown that numerical solutions on growing domains are independent of the initial\nconditions (these are prescribed as random small perturbations around the uniform steady state). This is due\nto domain growth which enhances robust selection of the transient patterns (Crampin et al. [11], Madzvamuse\net al. [22]). The ADI and MGFEM-2SBDF yield the observed bifurcation sequences independent of the initial\nconditions.\n6. Conclusions and discussion\nWhen solving reaction-diffusion equations on continuously deforming domains, domain growth and grid-\npoint velocity are additional parameters that greatly influence the selection of transient patterns. In applying\nnumerical methods to partial differential equations it is important to be aware of the role of mesh structure\n(grid-point velocity) and its influence on numerical solutions for reaction-diffusion systems on continuously\nA. Madzvamuse, P.K. Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119 117growing domains. In particular, the finite difference scheme can yield different solutions for different types of\nmesh structure. On fixed domains, it seems that the rectangular finite difference scheme (split-step) imposes\nimplicitly in its construction (using regular equal mesh) symmetrical solutions on regular domains. This same\nphenomenon has been observed in simulations by Kassam and Trefethen [15,16]. By solving reaction-diffusion\nequations using exponential time difference (a spectral method) fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method non-sym-\nmetric solutions were obtained on regular domains in contrast to symmetrical regular solutions obtained from\nthe finite difference scheme.\nHere we have presented solutions obtained using the ADI and MGFEM-2SBDF methods. The nodal-grid-\npoint velocity for the MGFEM-2SBDF scheme does not influence the bifurcation process of the transient\nsolutions on continuously growing domains due to the nature of its formulation which is independent of\nthe mesh structure. One can think of the nodal-grid-points of the unstructured mesh for the MGFEM-2SBDF\nmethod as randomly placed points on the planar domain. This is not the case with the ADI method. For this\nmethod we have shown, through simulations, how incorporating domain growth creates an added parameter \u2013\nthe grid-point velocity \u2013 which in turn stabilises certain symmetric patterns when a regular uniform square\nmesh is used. The grid-point velocity seems to play a pivotal role in influencing the bifurcation process in pat-\ntern selection depending on how slow (refined mesh) or fast (coarse mesh) the grid points move. We have been\nable to compute the sequences 1, 4, 8, 16,. . . and 1, 4, 16,. . . using a uniform square mesh structure. These\nsequences are obtained by simply changing the uniform square mesh from a coarse to a refined mesh respec-\ntively. There is an underlying bifurcation process related to the grid-point velocity depending on whether it is a\ncoarse or a refined mesh. However, by changing the structure of the uniform square mesh to a uniform rect-\nangular mesh, the above two sequences become unstable and only the sequence 1, 2, 4, 16,. . . is obtained. This\nis independent of whether the mesh is coarse or refined. Refining the square structure mesh implies a slower\ngrid-point movement thereby weakening the role of grid-point velocity in the bifurcation selection process. In\nthis case the bifurcation process occurs much later than on a coarse mesh. This can be seen in simulations\nshown in Fig. 8. Observe that the sequences illustrated here for each column are recorded at different times\nbecause of the nature of the mesh structure. The four spot pattern appears much earlier on a coarse mesh than\non a refined mesh, for example.\nThe results shown in this paper were also obtained by taking a refined timestep Dt to the orders of 10\u00024 and\ntherefore our results are robust to timestep refinement. However, on a continuously deforming domain, taking\na time-step less than 10\u00024 implies that the computations are prohibitively expensive due to the fact that this is\na growing domain problem (Madzvamuse, [19]).\nFigs. 5\u20139 show transient solutions on a continuously deforming unit square domain. We have carried out\nnumerical simulations to compute the spatially inhomogeneous steady state solutions on the final fixed square\ndomain using the ADI and MGFEM-2SBDF methods starting with random initial conditions. Both schemes\nconverge to either 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 spots (results not shown). The finite element results are independent of\nthe structure of the mesh and the choice really depends on how close the initial conditions are to the selected\npattern. The \u2018\u2018peanut\u2019\u2019 patterns observed in Fig. 6 re-organise into one of the 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 spot patterns\nonce the final domain has stopped growing and the simulation is allowed to converge to a steady state (results\nnot shown). For the ADI method the solution converged to does not only depend on the basis of attraction\ngiven by the initial conditions but also on the structure of the mesh. The selection of the regularly organised\nspot patterns 1, 4, 8, 16,. . . or 1, 4, 16,. . . are independent of the initial conditions, domain growth robustly\nenhances the selection process (except for the ADI scheme where the mesh structure influences the transition\nprocess). On a fixed domain to compute 16 spots one needs to precisely choose initial conditions which are\nvery close to the 16-spot steady state. In this sense, the work here extends that of Crampin et al. [9] who\nshowed that on one-dimensional domains, growth can select and stabilise patterns through the process of\nmode-doubling, but that this can be disrupted by noise, which may be due to the numerical scheme used (Bar-\nrass, et al. [2]).\nFrom the numerical experiments presented in this paper, it is clear that a better understanding of the bifur-\ncation theory on continuously deforming domains is required. This is not a trivial issue, to our knowledge no\nsuch analysis or theory has been developed on continuously deforming domains. Golubitsky and Comanici\nhave illustrated patterns on growing square domains via mode interactions (private manuscript) for linearised\nsystems. Our case is different, these are highly nonlinear systems. Equally important is a more detailed numer-\n118 A. Madzvamuse, P.K. Maini \/ Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 100\u2013119ical analysis on artificial diffusion which depends on mesh structure and domain growth. Work in this direc-\ntion is underway with studies carried out by Mckenzie and Mekwi [18]. Here they investigate the stability and\nconvergence of time integration schemes for the solution of a semi-discretisation of a single parabolic problem\nin one dimension using a moving mesh. Their results show that the backward Euler scheme is unconditionally\nstable in a mesh dependent L2 norm. Our model equations are much more complicated than a simple heat\nequation, however the theoretical framework developed in their paper gives us a platform to start a detailed\nnumerical analysis on artificial diffusion for nonlinear systems. This is the subject of our current studies.\nAcknowledgments\nAM would like to acknowledge financial support from the College of Science and Mathematics (COSAM),\nAuburn University. We thank Drs.
