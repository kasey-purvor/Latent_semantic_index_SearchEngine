The aim of the Commission was to \u2018identify the\nlimits of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress,\nincluding the problems with its measurement; to consider what additional\ninformation might be required for the production of more relevant indicators\nof social progress; to assess the feasibility of alternative measurement tools,\nand to discuss how to present the statistical information in an appropriate\nway\u2019 (p. 7).\nThe Report aims to speak to political leaders, policymakers, the academic\ncommunity (in particular statisticians) and civil society organisations. The\nReport itself is lengthy, running to 292 pages. This includes a 12-page\nexecutive summary, a \u2018short narrative\u2019 of around 60 pages, followed by\napproximately 200 pages of \u2018substantial arguments\u2019. Both the short narrative\nand the substantial arguments are divided into three chapters, the first\ndealing with classical GDP issues, the second with the quality of life, and the\nthird with sustainable development and the environment. The first two are\nof greatest potential interest to economic historians and are covered here.\nGiven that the Commission was created by the French government, it\nis dominated to a surprising extent by Americans. Of the 24 members of\nthe Commission, 13 were based at universities or other organisations in the\nUnited States, seven in French institutions, three in British universities, and\none from an Indian university. That said, the people selected to some extent\ncome from \u2018the left\u2019, at least in so far as they are not market fundamentalists.\nFor example, the three British representatives, Tony Atkinson, Andrew\nOswald and Nick Stern, are all associated in different ways with challenges\nto economic orthodoxy.\nThe Report trots out all the standard lines. What we measure affects what\nwe do. There is a difference between official measurements of key indicators,\nand widespread perceptions. Aggregates hide inequality. Depreciation and\nenvironmental damage are poorly captured. The Report also makes claims\nthat not everyone will accept: \u2018we are facing a looming environmental crisis\u2019\n358 European Review of Economic History\n(p. 9), although, to be fair, the Report acknowledges that not even every\nmember of the Commission agreed with that statement. It also argues that\n\u2018those attempting to guide the economy and our societies are like pilots trying\nto steer a course without a reliable compass\u2019 (p. 9).\nThe Report makes a number of recommendations, and it is on these\nthat it will ultimately be judged. It asks for a greater emphasis on income\nand consumption, rather than on production, with greater weight on the\nexperience of individual households rather than the economy as a whole, and\non wealth as well as income. It argues for greater emphasis on inequality, and\nthe inclusion of nonmarket activities. It argues that we should devote greater\neffort to looking at issues such as social connections, political voice, and\ninsecurity as other aspects of the quality of life. It argues that both objective\nand subjective wellbeing are important, and that surveys are a good way of\nfinding out about wellbeing. Finally, it argues that sustainability requires\nwhat it describes as a \u2018dashboard of indicators\u2019, which would include atmo-\nspheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and depletion of fishing stocks.\nAt one level this Report is correct. Gross domestic product is the most\nwidely used measure of economic activity, and it has any number of flaws. It\ndoes only measure market production, it does use market prices rather than\ntaking into account consumer surplus or externalities. It is poor at coping\nwith quality changes, particularly in services.\nAnd yet in another level, this Report manages to be both correct and\npointless. In my time I have met many politicians, many policymakers,\nmany in the academic community including statisticians and any number\nof representatives of civil society organisations. And in all of that time I have\nnever met a single person who felt that their job was to maximise GDP or\nGDP per head. Every single person from all of these categories that I have\never met has understood, implicitly as much as explicitly, that GDP is not\nthe be all and end all of success. Indeed, many years ago I was at a political\nmeeting in which someone in the audience accused politicians of being\nobsessed simply with GDP per head. One of the politicians on the platform \u2013\nnow a member of the British Cabinet \u2013 replied that this was self-evident\nnonsense. He listed a whole range of policies that would raise income per\nhead, but which were completely unthinkable. He pointed out that if we were\nreally dedicated to raising GDP per head we would favour euthanasia for\nalmost all old people, since the vast majority of old people have income lower\nthan the national average. Indeed, he went further and pointed out that since\nwe can predict with a moderate degree of accuracy someone\u2019s likely income\nby the time they start school, any government truly dedicated to maximising\nGDP per head would start its euthanasia programme at the preschool level.\nHe went on to list a huge range of other policies that we actually enact that\nclearly reduce measured GDP per head. Planning laws that protect green\nspaces are one example. Legislation that governs maximum pollution levels\nfrom factories is another.\nMeasuring economic performance and social progress 359\nIn modern democratic societies rises in income per head are a useful\nsummary measure of economic development. We know that in the last couple\nof years the fall in GDP per head has measured something very real: a\nrecession. We also know that the rise in GDP in the previous decade also\nmeasured something very real: a boom. Anyone with any understanding of\nthe nature of economic development could have predicted that the boom\nwould be followed by a slump, but no one if they are honest could predict\nwith any reliability the exact point at which boom would turn to bust, or the\ndepth or duration of the recession. We have not had the current recession\nbecause we failed to follow the sort of advice given by this Commission; we\nhave had the current recession because cyclicality is part of the nature of\nthe economic system. What the Commission emphatically does not make\nclear is what decisions politicians made in the absence of this Commission\u2019s\nReport, that they would not have made had they read this Report.\nIndeed, where the Report makes very specific recommendations it\nshould worry citizens were they to be followed. Let us take the very first\nrecommendation that is made: to emphasise national accounts aggregates\nother than GDP (section 3, pp. 23\u201330). In this section the authors make\na number of sensible points. They note that we should consider the\ndepreciation of capital goods. But for the vast majority of countries the\nratio between net national disposable income \u2013 their preferred measure \u2013\nand gross domestic product is well within the margins of error of being a\nconstant over time. France and the United States are given as examples of\nexactly this. In the case in Ireland, however, the figures are very different,\nand the Report is right that the figures for net national disposable income\ndemonstrate that the \u2018Celtic Tiger\u2019 was to some extent a fiction. Clearly,\nfor Ireland this paragraph of the Report is worth reading, but for citizens in\nmost countries it will make very little difference.\nSecond, the Report calls for improving the measurement of the quality of\nservices. And yet, as they note, \u2018it is difficult even to define\u2019 things such as\nthe \u2018general service level of the staff, choice and presentation of products and\nso forth\u2019 (p. 26). Too true! Of course, we can point to some aspects in which\nquality appears to have declined: Ryanair has removed the seat back pocket\nfrom its planes, for example, and casual empiricism seems to suggest that\nfor those of us who travel economy class, legroom is in ever shorter supply\n(for those who travel at the front of the plane, the development of flat beds\nrepresents a major step forward on long-haul flights). But taken as a whole it\nseems at least plausible that the level of service, the presentation of products,\nand so on and so forth has risen broadly in line with GDP. It would certainly\ntake some evidence to the contrary before I at least would be willing to spend\nserious amounts of government money working out alternative indicators in\nthis area. Equally, the Report is correct to note that the United States spends\nmore per capita on healthcare than most other countries, and that measuring\noutput by input, as is common in healthcare, does not give a sensible result.\n360 European Review of Economic History\nBut what the Report fails to do is tell us how to better measure the output\nof government-provided services such as healthcare. Again, it suggests that\nsurveys may be a useful way forward, but I am pretty sceptical of people\u2019s\nability to rate the quality of medical care on a sort of \u2018trip advisor\u2019 scale. My\ndaughter was cured of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, a relatively rare condition.\nEven though I have read much of the medical literature on juvenile idiopathic\narthritis, and even though I attended a conference on child rheumatology, I\nstill have no sensible method of assessing whether the time it took to diagnose\nmy daughter represented a good performance, an average performance, or\na poor performance either in the light of UK NHS expenditure in general,\nUK NHS expenditure on child rheumatology, or in the light of global best\npractice. And yet if I cannot do it for as straightforward a surgical procedure\nas this, having read widely on the subject, what hope is there to assess\nhealthcare by consumer surveys internationally?\nThird, the Report argues that we should focus on household consumption,\nrather than total final consumption. They note that this would exclude\nthings such as prisons, military expenditure and the clean-up of oil spills.\nThis is perhaps the most bizarre recommendation of all. It implies that\nthe provision of prisons, military expenditure and the clean-up of oil spills\nhave no beneficial effects on human welfare. A government setting out to\nmaximise household consumption should therefore imprison no one, spend\nnothing on the military and ignore any oil spills that occur. Writing this\nreview in the summer of 2010, having seen Barack Obama\u2019s opinion poll\nratings plunge in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, I am sceptical\nthat ignoring oil spills is actually what citizens want. I am equally certain that\ncitizens gain some utility from knowing that people who might be dangerous\nare locked up, and that countries that might attack them are deterred, and\ncan be repulsed if necessary. That is not to say that the specific levels of\nexpenditure on prisons or defence are always appropriate, but to say that\nexpenditure on these things should be excluded from some measure that\naims to capture the welfare of citizens is positively bizarre.\nFourth, this section of the Report calls for income to be considered in\nconjunction with wealth. It argues that \u2018wealth is an important indicator\nof the sustainability of actual consumption\u2019. The problem is that wealth is\nextremely hard to measure. The Report acknowledges that human capital\nis hard to measure, and that for many people the skills they have are their\nsingle most important asset. This is particularly true for young people, and\nit is almost impossible to see how this measure of wealth could really be\nincorporated with any degree of reliability. Furthermore, assets for which\nthere exist markets are likely to be valued at market rates. Here the problem\nis that we may be in danger of emphasising booms even more prominently.\nIn the 10 years leading up to the most recent recession, for example, shares\nand particularly house prices rose really rather rapidly in Anglo-Saxon\neconomies. It is easy to dismiss this in retrospect as a bubble (although\nMeasuring economic performance and social progress 361\nas British property prices have barely fallen, the evidence for a bubble is\neasy to contest), but there is little doubt that at the time people felt that\nthese rises in asset prices were securely underpinned and should be seen as\nlegitimate. Were the British and American economies to have followed the\nrecommendations of this Report, therefore, there is a danger that they would\nhave been even more confident five years ago about the sustainability of the\neconomic models that they were then pursuing.\nFifth, the Report urges a greater consideration of the differences between\nmean and median incomes. There is no doubt that writing an economic\nhistory of the postwar world using the median rather than the mean gives\na different picture, particularly over the last 30 years. Yet this is surely well\nunderstood by all commentators, and above all by politicians who, more\nthan anyone, know that they have to deliver for the average person. Political\nscientists have median voter models, not mean voter models.\nFinally, this section of the Report calls for greater emphasis on including\nnonmarket activities, including both domestic production and leisure. It\npresents hypothetical examples to show that moving to a world in which we\npay people to do our cleaning, and make our sandwiches, will overstate the\nrise in national income. Against that, the rise in leisure time in those countries\nover time means that we are understating the rise in national income. The net\ndirection of bias is not apparent. It notes that these things are very difficult to\ndo, that existing estimates are imprecise, and that \u2018only if there is sufficient\nconfidence in extended measures of income will there be a broader take-up\nby statistical offices\u2019 (p. 38). This is surely correct, and that confidence is\nunlikely to be forthcoming.\nEconomic historians are concerned with the quality of life, as much\nas with material economic progress. This is also an important part of\nthe Commission\u2019s Report. The Commission argues that measures such as\nthe human development index should not replace conventional economic\nindicators, but instead \u2018provide an opportunity to enrich policy discussions\nand to inform people\u2019s view of the conditions of the communities where\nthey live\u2019 (p. 41, italics in the original). The Report argues that there are\nthree useful definitions of the quality of life. The first one is subjective:\ndo individuals say that they are satisfied with their life? The second builds\non the notion of capabilities, while the third is based on the notion of \u2018fair\nallocations\u2019 (p. 42). This section is characterised by a very sensible discussion\nof the issues, followed by relatively limited recommendations.\nThe first recommendation is simply that larger-scale official surveys should\nbe taken of people\u2019s self-reported happiness, their hedonic experiences and\ntheir priorities. The British government already does this, and in the light\nof the Report\u2019s own acceptance that people in different countries have\nradically different preferences (p. 48), it is hard to imagine that these sorts\nof surveys can be standardised internationally in a useful way, in the manner\nof standardised national accounts that underpin GDP estimates.\n362 European Review of Economic History\nThe second recommendation is that objective measurement of people\u2019s\nhealth, education, personal activities, political voice, social connections,\nenvironmental conditions and insecurity should be undertaken. Whilst\nmeasures of people\u2019s health and education are relatively straightforward\nand already undertaken, it is hard to see how objective measures can be\ntaken of people\u2019s personal activities, political voice and social connections.\nThe Report also needs to think through the potential conflict between this\nrecommendation and the previous one. It may well be that our environmental\nconditions are \u2018objectively\u2019 declining, in so far as global warming is a real\nthreat to our standard of living. But it is equally clear that a large number\nof people think that global warming is a myth, or that in so far as it is not a\nmyth it is a simple natural phenomenon that we should ignore. Subjectively\nthese people derive no disutility from global warming, even if \u2018objectively\u2019\nthey are worse off. Or, were we to find that global warming is a problem\nthat solves itself, or turned out not to exist, then there will have existed\npeople who subjectively felt much worse off, who were scared for the future\nof our planet, but who \u2018objectively\u2019 had nothing to fear. We do not know\nwhich of these two scenarios is correct, and nor do we know how we should\nreconceptualise our understanding of living standards and the quality of\nlife even were we to know which scenario was correct. The balancing of\nsubjective and objective measures in understanding people\u2019s wellbeing is\nvery difficult, and the Report of the Commission does not take us very far in\nunderstanding this issue.\nThe Report\u2019s third recommendation in the quality of life section is that\nquality of life indicators should always include inequality of the various\nmeasures being looked at. Thus we should not only look at inequality of\nincome, but we should also look at inequality in education, health, social\nconnections, environmental conditions and so on. No evidence is offered\nthat inequality along these dimensions is radically different from income\ninequality. Furthermore, the Report argues that inequality across these\ndimensions should be assessed not just across people, as individuals, but also\nacross socio-economic groups, and across generations. It argues, although\nwithout a strong philosophical backing, for special attention to inequalities\nthat have arisen more recently, such as those linked to immigration. Why a\nmassively entrenched inequality, which has persisted for generations, should\nbe treated less seriously than one that has recently arisen, it is not clear.\nFinally, it calls for statistical offices to release information in such a way\nthat other researchers can aggregate the information in different ways to\nproduce different indices. At one level this request is unobjectionable, but\nat another it seems to risk undoing the central objective of the Commission.\nIf there are a myriad of different indicators, some of them going up, and\nsome of them going down, some of them showing that Britain is a better\nplace to live in than France, others of them showing the reverse, then it is\nreally unlikely that any of these indicators are going to gain the salience of\nMeasuring economic performance and social progress 363\nGDP per head. There are many indicators out there already, and one of\nthe great attractions of GDP per head, for policymakers and civil society, is\nthat it is widely understood and widely respected. It is not perfect, but we\nknow its flaws. In suggesting that we create a myriad of different alternative\nindices, the Commission risks handing victory back to GDP per head, by\ndefault. That is surely not the intention, but it is a risk of this particular\nrecommendation.\nEconomic historians are busy people. We have research to do, classes to\nteach, scripts to mark. There are referee\u2019s reports to write, books to review,\nand references on students to produce. Our time is limited, and valuable.\nThe Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance\nand Social Progress is mildly interesting, but offers little by way of value to\neconomic historians. It does not give alternative counterfactuals over time\nof how different societies have performed according to different indices.\nIt makes no case that, taken as a whole, changes in GDP per head either\noverestimate or underestimate \u2018economic performance and social progress\u2019,\nor that that measure is more or less accurate for different countries or for\ndifferent time periods. Instead, it has a wish list of things that individually\nmight well be quite nice, but which collectively do not add up to a research\nagenda, either for current economists or for economic historians, and which\ndo not collectively add up to any coherent alternative vision of how economic\nperformance and social progress should be measured. Economic historians\nare likely to have better things to do with their time than to read this Report.\n"}
