Introduction \nSome neo-Malthusians have developed a theory of fertility change that is based on \ntwo fundamental and inter-related premises (see Hardin 1968, 1974; Abernethy 1993, \n1999, 2002; Abernethy and Penaloza 2002; Cairns 2004).1 First, scarcities and \nconstraints keep fertility in check. Second, increased economic prospects or \n                                                 \n1 I call this \u2018a\u2019 rather than \u2018the\u2019 neo-Malthusian theory of fertility change since other neo-Malthusians \nfrom the ones cited may have different views, particularly as concerns the effect of economic \nprosperity on fertility. \n2 \n\u2018perceived economic opportunities\u2019 (Abernethy 2002) raise fertility. From these \npremises three testable hypotheses are derived, namely: \n \n1. Food aid raises fertility rates in recipient countries. \n2. Emigration from developing to developed countries raises fertility rates in the \nsending countries.2 \n3. Economic prosperity raises fertility rates. \n \nWhen combined with another neo-Malthusian premise, namely that fertility rates \nare generally already higher than carrying capacity would allow for, particularly in \ndeveloping countries, policy implications follow from these hypotheses. Following \nfrom the first hypothesis, the policy implication is that food aid should be either \nwithdrawn or at least reduced. From the second hypothesis follows the call for strict \nlimits on immigration to developed countries, possibly extended to the call for zero \nnet migration in all countries. The policy implication following from the third \nhypothesis is somewhat unclear. Preventing economic prosperity is not called for. \nRather, it seems that the main purpose of the third hypothesis is to warn policy makers \n                                                 \n2 This argument is also embraced by Daly (2004). The same is true for Ehrlich and Ehrlich (2004: 108). \nHowever, otherwise Ehrlich and Ehrlich do not subscribe to the neo-Malthusian theory of fertility \nchange and even, by and large, embrace the demographic transition theory, which is anathema to neo-\nMalthusians (see below). A related and recently hotly debated issue is whether immigration to \ndeveloped countries should be restricted on environmental grounds. This debate focuses mainly on the \neffects of immigration on the environment in developed countries, which are independent of the effects \nof migration on fertility rates in developing sending countries \u2013 see the forthcoming discussion forum \non Migration, Globalization and the Environment in the journal Ecological Economics (Muradian, \nNeumayer and R\u00f8pke 2006). \n3 \nthat economic prosperity will not lower, and indeed will raise, fertility rates such that \nfertility needs to be controlled via other means. \nThe existing literature has discussed whether the policy implications are morally \njustifiable (see, for example, Griffin 1988, 1989; Fletcher 1991; Singer 1993; Ryberg \n1997; Brzozowski 2003; Naess 2004). However, to my knowledge there does not \nexist any study attempting to test these hypotheses of fertility change empirically. If \nthe hypotheses do not hold, then the policy implications do not follow, whether or not \nthey are morally justifiable. The neo-Malthusians themselves mainly provide \nexamples and casual evidence, which they regard as supportive of their hypotheses, \nbut no rigorous test. Such a test is the objective of this short paper. In brief, the results \npresented here fail to confirm the hypotheses and often contradict them. \n \n2. A neo-Malthusian theory of fertility change \nThomas Robert Malthus (1798) was not the first one to express such ideas, but his \nEssay on the Principle of Population became so famous that an entire school of \nthought became known as Malthusian or, in its modern version, neo-Malthusian. \nMalthus was convinced that the limitedness of land imposed decreasing rates of return \non all other factors of production and put an absolute scarcity constraint on food \nproduction in particular. Population growth is kept in check by the scarcity constraint; \nif the constraint is temporarily transgressed, then famine, disease and warfare will \nbring population down. Population size will again increase, only to hit the absolute \nscarcity constraint afterwards again in an apparently endless vicious circle. Only \nfertility restraints such as the postponement of marriage can break the circle. \nSome modern followers of Malthus have modified this view, but the idea that \nfertility increases and population growth are constrained by limits of the carrying \n4 \ncapacity of the available land is at the heart of neo-Malthusian thought. Hardin\u2019s \n(1968) famous \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d and more explicitly, though less well \nknown, his \u201cLiving on a Lifeboat\u201d (1974) essays are probably the most radical and \nnon-apologetic formulations of a neo-Malthusian theory of fertility change. In the \nlatter essay he paints a picture of nation-states as individual lifeboats, the capacity of \nwhich is constrained by each nation\u2019s carrying capacity. The trouble is that, according \nto his view, some developing countries have gone beyond their carrying capacity. \nMetaphorically speaking, the high fertility rate has led to an over-loading of their \nlifeboats. Hence, many individuals are swimming in the water and will die if not \nfished out of it. Hardin argues that the only viable and morally justifiable solution is \nto leave these people to their fate. Taking them all into the lifeboats of the developed \ncountries would only sink those as well, while taking a limited number in would \ndestroy the boats\u2019 safety margins. Importantly, even if all those floating in the water \ncould be rescued, this would not represent a long-term solution because it would \nentice the populations on the developing country lifeboats to grow further, such that in \nthe future more people would be in need of assistance: \u2018Tragically, gifts of food that \nsave human lives in a poor country increase human fertility where an increase is least \ntolerable\u2019 (Hardin 1995: 118). Providing assistance would thus only spur a vicious \ncircle that would eventually lead to \u2018a catastrophe of scarcely imaginable proportions\u2019 \n(Hardin 1974: 564) and can only be broken if assistance is refused. It is only by \nmaking them experience the constraints of their own lifeboats\u2019 carrying capacity that \nthey will learn how to keep their fertility in check. The two kinds of assistance that \nHardin (1974) explicitly discusses are food aid, which moves food to starving people, \nand migration to developed countries, which moves starving people to food. Hence, \nhe advocates severely restricting, if not abandoning, both. \n5 \nAbernethy (1993, 2002) has developed the critique of demographic transition \ntheory, that is already contained in Hardin (1974), furthest and has set up her own \ncompeting \u2018fertility opportunity hypothesis\u2019. According to her, it is not economic \nmodernization, prosperity, education and declining infant mortality that lower fertility \nrates, but deteriorating economic conditions (Abernethy 1993: 240). Food aid and the \nprospect of emigration to developed countries raise the perceived economic \nopportunities of populations in developing countries and thereby raise their fertility \nrates or, at least, prevent them from falling as much as they otherwise would. \n \n3. An empirical test \nWith two exceptions, I know of no studies that provide an empirical test of the \nhypotheses stated above.3 Tzougas and Tziafetas (1989) estimate the impact of \ninternational migration on fertility rates in Greece over the period 1968 to 1986. They \nfind that a higher migration out of Greece has a negative effect on fertility that is \nstatistically insignificant in ordinary least squares (OLS), but significant in a \nsimultaneous equation model. The question is whether the result generalizes beyond \nGreece.  \nAbernethy and Penaloza (2002) report results from an OLS estimation with 128 \nobservations of percentage change in the total fertility rate from different points of \ntime in the 1990s. The explanatory variables are dummy variables for countries in \nCentral America, South America and the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d (Hong Kong, Indonesia, \n                                                 \n3 Many more studies have analysed the effect of internal migration, typically from rural to urban areas, \non fertility, generally finding that such migration is associated with lower fertility rates \u2013 see, for \nexample, Rowe and Rodgers (1994), Jensen and Ahlburg (2004), Kulu (2005). However, these studies \nare not directly relevant to the hypotheses tested here, which refer to international migration. \n6 \nJapan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand), \nwith Caribbean countries as the omitted reference category. These dummy variables \nare interacted with a dummy variable for the period 1997 to 1999. The only \nstatistically significant explanatory variable in the reported estimation table is the \ninteraction of the Asian Tiger dummy variable with the period dummy variable. Its \nnegative sign is interpreted as the negative effect of \u2018the economic collapse of former \n\u201cAsian tigers\u201d in late summer, 1997\u2019 (Abernethy and Penaloza 2002: 245) on fertility \nrates and is therefore interpreted as evidence for the \u2018opportunity fertility hypothesis\u2019. \nThis study suffers from a number of severe shortcomings, which render the \ninterpretation of its findings highly questionable. First, there is sample selection bias \nin restricting the sample to a selection of countries. Second, there is aggregation bias \nin lumping together countries with very different experiences of economic \nperformance for the construction of dummy variables, both within the group of \n\u201cAsian tigers\u201d and within the remaining regional groups. Third, there is omitted \nvariable bias by not including other explanatory variables. \nTo test the hypotheses more rigorously, the sample used here consists of all non-\nOECD countries in the world for which data are available. We exclude the \nOrganisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries since \nthe theory is explicitly about fertility change in developing countries, but results are \nrather similar if OECD countries are included. The dependent variable is the total \nfertility rate (number of births per women), defined as \u2018the number of children that \nwould be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and \nbear children in accordance with prevailing age-specific fertility rates\u2019, with data \ntaken from World Bank (2005). The main results are consistent if the natural log of \nfertility rates is taken as the dependent variable instead. \n7 \nTo test the first hypothesis, total food aid shipments in tons of cereals to a recipient \ncountry by all donors are taken from FAO (2005). This is divided by population size \nto create food aid per capita as the relevant measure. Data on international migration, \nneeded to test the second hypothesis, are notoriously difficult to get. The best data \nexist on migration to the US, for which Clark, Hatton and Williamson (2002) have \ncollected data over the period 1959 to 1998 for up to 180 countries. Hatton and \nWilliamson (2002) have put together data on net international emigration rates for 80 \ncountries for six years over the period 1972 to 1996. Finally, Docquier and Marfouk \n(2006) have calculated the number of nationals of the working-age population (aged \n25 and over) that reside outside their home country and within one of the countries of \nthe OECD for up to 190 countries for the years 1990 and 2000. The emigration rate \nvariable is the number of people aged 25 and over residing in OECD countries \nrelative to the sum of all nationals of that age group, living at home or in OECD \ncountries. All three data sources have their respective strengths and weaknesses and \nalso capture different aspects of international migration. For example, the migration to \nthe US data have good availability, but capture migration to only one, if perhaps the \nmost important, developed country in terms of immigration. The net emigration rates \nmake no distinction between migration to developed and developing countries and \nmeasure the difference between out-migration and in-migration rather than out-\nmigration itself. The remaining measure is only available for two points in time, but \nmeasures the stock rather than flow of emigration, thereby capturing past migration \nflows. Interestingly, however, all three measures lead to rather similar results as we \nwill see below.  \nTesting the third hypothesis is in some sense impossible. This is because according \nto Abernethy (1999) what matters are subjective perceptions of prosperity and these \n8 \nare of course next to impossible to measure. The recourse to subjective perceptions \nalso makes the hypothesis almost non-falsifiable.4 With these caveats in mind, we \ntake the economic growth rate as our measure of economic prosperity. After all, the \ncollapse of economic growth in many \u201cAsian tiger\u201d countries in the late 1990s is \ntaken as an indication for drastically reduced perceptions of economic opportunities \nby Abernethy and Penaloza (2002) themselves. \nAs control variables we use the natural log of real gross domestic product per \ncapita (GDP p.c.), the infant mortality rate and the female labour force participation \nrate, with data taken from World Bank (2005). Per capita income controls for the \ndemographic transition that countries undergo in moving from low incomes with high \nfertility to high incomes with low fertility (Strulik and Sikandar 2002). Note that per \ncapita income has not only a direct effect on fertility rates, but also an indirect one via \nits correlation with things such as various aspects of health care provision, for which \ncomparable data are difficult to get for a large sample. Infant mortality captures the \nidea that parents aim for a certain number of surviving children rather than births and \nthat infant mortality is positively associated with fertility rates since with high infant \nmortality women need to give birth to more children in order to reach their intended \nfamily size (Lee 2003).5 Female labour force participation controls for the effect that \n                                                 \n4 Witness the argument in Abernethy (1999: 143) that education, health care and higher living \nstandards are typically associated with declining fertility because they first raise and then dash hopes \nfor real progress: \u2018Thus, it appears that better education and healthcare, and images of a rising standard \nof living \u2013 although themselves not the precipitants of the fertility decline \u2013 may set the stage for the \ndisillusionment and disappointment that do drive down fertility.\u2019 Clearly, with recourse to such twisted \nlogic any argument becomes almost impossible to falsify. \n5 Infant mortality has slightly better data availability than mortality below the age of five. The two are \nhighly correlated with each other. \n9 \nfemale empowerment might have on fertility rates (Sanderson and Dubrow 2000; Sen \n2001). One could of course think of other proxy variables for female empowerment, \nbut the labour force participation rate has the advantage of good data availability and \nwas also found to be more strongly related to fertility rates than female education \nlevels by McClamroch (1996). Table 1 provides summary descriptive variable \nstatistics as well as a bivariate correlation matrix. Note that because the emigration \nstock rate variable is only available for two years, it is not included in the correlation \nmatrix to prevent a massive loss of observations. It is correlated at r = .77 with the \nmigration rate to the US and at r = 0.20 with the net out-migration rate. \n \n< Insert Table 1 around here > \n \nWe average data over five-year periods, since both the explanatory and dependent \nvariables are not equally well available in all years for all countries. Note, however, \nthat the main results are consistent if we use annual data instead, in which case some \ncountries have many more observations than others. We estimate both random- and \nfixed-effects models with fully panel-robust standard errors, i.e. standard errors are \nnot only robust to heteroskedasticity, but also to autocorrelation. The inclusion of \ncountry fixed effects is justified if one or more of the explanatory variables are \ncorrelated with time-invariant factors specific to each country.6 We also include \nperiod-specific time dummies to mitigate the possibility that our explanatory variables \nare merely picking up a time effect. The inclusion of control variables including \n                                                 \n6 Barber (2002) argues that, for a range of reasons, fertility is related to geographic latitude and winter \ntemperatures. However, it is unclear to what extent the relationship is spurious and is down to socio-\neconomic differences across countries that are correlated with latitude and winter temperatures. \n10 \ncountry and time fixed effects is necessary to do justice to the theory. Food aid and \nmigration to developed countries as well as good economic prospects might not raise \nfertility rates, but might prevent them from falling as much as they otherwise would. \nHence, the theory would predict a positive effect of these three variables on fertility \nrates only contingent on the presence of other variables that can explain the \ndownward trend in fertility rates over time. \nReverse causality of our main explanatory variables is certainly a possibility. \nHowever, if existent, it would favour the theory as countries with higher fertility rates \nare likely to have higher emigration rates and are perhaps more likely to receive \nhigher food aid shipments. Since the results reported below fail to confirm the theory, \npotential remedies for reverse causality such as instrumental variable regression are \nnot pursued any further. \n \n4. Results \nTable 2 presents estimation results. The control variables and the economic growth \nrate are always included. To these are added the migration and food aid variables in \nseparate regressions. In columns I and II the migration rate to the U.S. is included in \nrandom- and fixed-effects estimation. Total fertility rates are positively associated \nwith infant mortality rates and negatively with female labour force participation, per \ncapita income and its growth rate. A higher migration rate to the US is negatively \nassociated with fertility. The Hausman test does not suggest systematic differences \nbetween the fixed-effects and the random-effects estimation. This suggests that the \nrandom-effects estimation provides not only more efficient, but also consistent results. \nThis holds true for the other random-effects estimations reported in table 2 as well. \n11 \nNevertheless, we also report fixed-effects estimation results since statistical tests may \nfail to detect inconsistency. \nIn columns III and IV the migration variable is the net emigration rate. In random-\neffects estimation, the net emigration rate, the economic growth rate and per capita \nincome are all negatively related to fertility, whereas the opposite is the case for infant \nmortality. In fixed-effects estimation, only the infant mortality and the net emigration \nrate remain statistically significant. In columns V and VI the migration variable is the \nstock of emigrants aged 25 or over residing in OECD countries relative to the sum of \nadult nationals from a country. Note that this is a stock variable, not a flow variable \nlike the previous ones. A higher value reflects larger migration to developed countries \nin the past. As it is only available for two years, we estimate two separate cross-\nsectional regressions.7 In both estimations, a higher emigration and female labour \nforce participation rate as well as per capita income are negatively associated with \nfertility, whereas the opposite is the case for infant mortality. In column VI economic \ngrowth has a statistically significantly negative effect on fertility rates, but is \ninsignificant in column V. In columns VII and VIII, food aid per capita replaces the \nmigration variables. It is negative and statistically significant in both random- and \nfixed-effects estimation. Per capita income, the economic growth and female labour \nforce participation rate have a negative, the infant mortality rate a positive effect on \nfertility rates. \n \n< Insert Table 2 around here > \n \n                                                 \n7 Note that for regression VI total fertility rates from 2002 rather than 2000 were taken due to lack of \ndata for many countries in 2000. \n12 \nIn terms of robustness tests, I lagged the independent variables by one period. \nThe reason is that migration, food aid and economic growth (as well as the other \nexplanatory variables) could have a delayed rather than contemporaneous effect on \nfertility rates. The results are hardly affected. It is also possible that the effect differs \nacross groups of countries. In particular, it could be that the effect is more in line with \nthe tested hypotheses in very poor countries than in developing countries with \nsomewhat higher per capita incomes. The regressions were therefore re-run for the \ngroup of low-income, lower middle-income and upper middle-income developing \ncountries separately, using World Bank country income classifications. With one \nexception, none of the migration, food aid or economic growth variables became \npositive and statistically significantly different from zero in any of the regressions. \nThe exception is the net out-migration rate, which became positive for the group of \nlow-income countries, but with a t-statistics of 1.69 only. In other words, the \ncoefficient was barely statistically significant and the result might be down to pure \nchance.8\n \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper has provided an empirical test of three hypotheses that some neo-\nMalthusians derive from their theory of fertility change. The results clearly fail to \nsupport the theoretical predictions. Migration out of developing countries is generally \nassociated with lower, not higher fertility rates. So are food aid and economic growth. \nWhat might explain the results? Starting with economic growth, since the \u2018fertility \nopportunity hypothesis\u2019 is set up by Abernethy (1993, 2002) in contradiction to \ndemographic transition theory, the negative result needs no further explanation. As \n                                                 \n8 Detailed results of robustness tests available on request. \n13 \nconcerns food aid, it is quite possible that the negative link with fertility is spurious. \nFood aid is likely to be higher when countries experience droughts and famines. It is \nwell established that fertility rates go down during such events (see Dyson and \u00d3 \nGr\u00e1da 2002). Hence, the negative effect might be caused by the event that triggers \nfood aid rather than by food aid itself.  \nOn migration, one possibility is that those who leave the country have a higher \nfertility propensity than those who are left behind. However, there is little evidence \nfor this and selectivity is unlikely to be a major cause (Jensen and Ahlburg 2004). \nAnother possibility is disruption of fertility due to the physical separation of couples. \nOften, it is men who migrate first and are able to bring their spouses and already \nexisting children with them only after a considerable period of time. Yet another \nexplanation could be that countries with higher out-migration receive higher \nremittance payments, not necessarily captured by official per capita income figures. In \nas much as higher incomes are associated with lower fertility rates as demographic \ntransition theory and most of the empirical evidence presented above would suggest, \nthis might explain the negative effect of out-migration. Lacking data to test the \nvarious possible channels, not much more than these speculations can be offered at \nthis point. What we do know, however, is that whatever the channel, existing \nevidence fails to support and even often contradicts the theory of fertility change \nespoused by some neo-Malthusians. \n \nReferences \nAbernethy, Virginia Deane. 2002.
