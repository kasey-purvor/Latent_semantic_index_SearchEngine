The formalism embodies both DGLAP and BFKL con-\ntributions, and accounts for the angular ordering which comes from coherence effects in\ngluon emission. We check that the unintegrated distributions give the measured values of\nthe deep inelastic structure function F2(x,Q\n2).\n1 Introduction\nConventionally deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering is described in terms of scale-dependent\nparton distributions, a(x, \u00b52), where a = xg or xq. These distributions correspond to the density\nof partons in the proton with longitudinal momentum fraction x, integrated over transverse\nmomentum up to kt = \u00b5. They satisfy DGLAP evolution in \u00b5\n2. The kinematic region kt < \u00b5\ngives the leading ln\u00b52 approximation to deep inelastic scattering.\nFor less inclusive processes it is, however, necessary to consider distributions unintegrated\nover the transverse momentum kt of the parton. The unintegrated distributions have the\nadvantage that they exactly correspond to the quantity which enters the Feynman diagrams\nand therefore allow for the true kinematics of the process even at leading order (LO). These\n1\ndistributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) depend on two hard scales1: kt and the scale \u00b5 of the probe. The\nscale \u00b5 plays a dual role. On the one hand it acts as the factorization scale, while on the other\nhand it controls the angular ordering of the partons emitted in the evolution [1].\nClearly it is desirable to also include ln(1\/x) BFKL-type contributions in the evolution. Re-\ncall that both DGLAP and BFKL evolution are essentially equivalent to ordered evolution in\nthe angles of the emitted partons2. In the DGLAP collinear approximation the angle increases\ndue to the growth of kt, while in BFKL the angle (\u03b8 \u2243 kt\/k\u2113) grows due to the decreasing\nlongitudinal momentum fraction as we proceed along the emission chain from the proton. The\nfactorization scale \u00b5 separates the partons associated with emission from different parts of the\nprocess, that is from the beam and target protons (in pp collisions) and from the hard subpro-\ncess. For example it separates emissions from the beam (with polar angle \u03b8 <\u223c 90\n\u25e6) from those\nfrom the target (with \u03b8 >\u223c 90\n\u25e6), and from the intermediate partons from the hard subprocess.\nThis separation was proved in Ref. [1] and originates from the destructive interference of the\ndifferent emission amplitudes in the angular boundary regions. If the longitudinal momentum\nfraction is fixed by the hard subprocess, then the limits on the angles can be expressed in terms\nof a factorization scale \u00b5 which corresponds to the upper limit3 on the allowed values of the\n(s-channel) parton kt.\nSince the parton distributions depend on two scales we potentially have to deal with com-\nplicated (CCFM [1]) evolution equations for the fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) functions. Of course it is possible\nto work with two-scale distributions, but this is much more complicated [2] and up to now\nhas only proved practical with Monte Carlo generators [3]. However, the evolution process is\nessentially controlled by one quantity, the emission angle, and on this basis we may expect to\nbe able to obtain the distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) from single-scale evolution equations. Therefore\nit should be possible to follow an analytic approach where the physical assumptions are much\nmore evident and where, in principle, NLO corrections can be included. Moreover, in practice,\nit is much easier to use the same unintegrated distributions to describe different hard processes\nand to perform global parton analyses.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. The key observation is that the \u00b5 dependence of the\nunintegrated distributions enters at the last step of the evolution, and so we may use single-\nscale evolution equations. The procedure is first described in Section 2 in the case of pure\nDGLAP evolution, and then extended to include ln(1\/x) effects in Section 3. In the latter case\nwe use the solution of a single-scale equation which unifies DGLAP and BFKL evolution [4],\nand perform a final evolution step which brings in the dependence on the second scale. Ref. [5]\nalso generated the two-scale unintegrated gluon from the same unified evolution equation, but\n1This property is hidden in the conventional distributions as kt is integrated up to the scale \u00b5.\n2At LO we have strong ordering of the emission angles, . . . \u03b8i \u226a \u03b8i+1 . . .; on the other hand if, at one step of\nthe evolution \u03b8i \u223c \u03b8i+1, then this contribution is included inside the NLO splitting function.\n3The t-channel parton may have kt up to \u00b5\/z, characteristic of BFKL effects, whereas for LO DGLAP the\ns and t-channel partons are both limited by kt < \u00b5. Of course, some kt > \u00b5 contribution will arise from the\nNLO splitting functions.\n2\nwith a different procedure4. The unintegrated gluons obtained using the procedures described\nin Sections 2, 3 and Ref. [5] are compared in Section 4. In Section 5 we describe how the\nstructure function F2 is calculated from the unintegrated parton distributions, and in Section 6\nwe discuss the relationship between the unintegrated and integrated distributions. Finally in\nSection 7 we give our conclusions.\n2 Unintegrated DGLAP partons\nIt is informative to review how unintegrated distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) may be calculated from\nthe conventional (integrated) parton densities, a(x, \u00b52), in the case of pure DGLAP evolution.\nThe procedure was explained in Ref. [6]. We start from the DGLAP equation5\n\u2202a(x, \u00b52)\n\u2202 ln\u00b52\n=\n\u03b1S\n2pi\n[\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\nx\nPaa\u2032(z) a\n\u2032\n(\nx\nz\n, \u00b52\n)\ndz \u2212 a(x, \u00b52)\n\u2211\na\u2032\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\n0\nPa\u2032a(z\n\u2032)dz\u2032\n]\n(1)\nwhere in the first term a sum over all possible parent partons a\u2032 is implied. This first term on the\nright-hand-side describes the number of partons \u03b4a emitted in the interval \u00b52 < k2t < \u00b5\n2+ \u03b4\u00b52.\nSuch emission clearly changes the transverse momentum kt of the evolving parton. If we were\nto neglect the virtual contribution in (1), then the unintegrated parton density would be given\nsimply by\nfa(x, k\n2\nt ) =\n\u2202a(x, \u00b52)\n\u2202 ln\u00b52\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u00b52=k2\nt\n=\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2pi\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\nx\nPaa\u2032(z) a\n\u2032\n(\nx\nz\n, k2t\n)\ndz. (2)\nThe virtual contribution in (1) does not change the parton kt and may be resummed to give\nthe survival probability Ta that parton a with transverse momentum kt remains untouched in\nthe evolution up to the factorization scale. The survival probability is given by\nTa(kt, \u00b5) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u00b52\nk2\nt\n\u03b1S(k\n\u20322\nt )\n2pi\ndk\u20322t\nk\u20322t\n\u2211\na\u2032\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\n0\nPa\u2032a(z\n\u2032) dz\u2032\n)\n, (3)\na` la Sudakov form factor. Thus the probability to find parton a with transverse momentum kt\n(which initiates a hard subprocess with factorization scale \u00b5) is\nfa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) = Ta(kt, \u00b5)\n[\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2pi\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\nx\nPaa\u2032(z) a\n\u2032\n(\nx\nz\n, k2t\n)\ndz\n]\n. (4)\n4In this work we impose the angular ordering constraint in both the BFKL and DGLAP terms, and as\na result do not have an exact equality between the integral up to \u00b52 of the unintegrated distributions and\nthe value of the integrated distribution. Ref. [5] takes the opposite approach; that is, exact equality with the\nintegrated distribution is imposed and as a result angular ordering of the BFKL contribution is not complete.\nThe difference is a NLO effect.\n5For the g \u2192 gg splitting we have to insert a factor z\u2032 in front of Pgg(z\n\u2032) in the last integral of (1) to account\nfor the identity of the produced gluons.\n3\nIt is at this last step of the evolution that the unintegrated distribution becomes dependent on\nthe two scales, k2t and \u00b5\n2.\nWe now have to take care to specify the value of the infrared cut-off \u2206, which is introduced\nto protect the 1\/(1\u2212z) singularity in the splitting functions arising from soft gluon emission. In\nthe original DGLAP equation, (1), which describes the evolution of the integrated distributions,\nthis singularity is cancelled between the real emission and virtual contributions. However after\nthe resummation of the virtual terms, the real soft gluon emission must be accounted for\nexplicitly since it changes the kt of the parton. Thus we have to find the physically appropriate\nchoice of the cut-off \u2206 to provide the angular ordering of the gluon emissions6.\nIn Ref. [6] the cut-off was taken to be \u2206 = kt\/\u00b5. As a consequence the two-scale unintegrated\ndistributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) of [6] vanish for kt > \u00b5, in accordance with the DGLAP strong\nordering in kt. However we can do better and impose the more correct angular ordering in the\nlast step of the evolution. It was shown in Refs. [1, 5] that this leads to a constraint on the\nscale \u00b5, namely\n\u0398(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032) \u21d2 \u00b5 > zkt\/(1\u2212 z). (5)\nThus the maximum allowed value of the integration variable z is\nzmax =\n\u00b5\n\u00b5+ kt\n(6)\nand the corresponding cut-off \u2206 = kt\/(\u00b5 + kt). Of course the same \u2206 must be used both in\nthe real emission integral in (4) and in the survival probability T in (3).7 In fact we shall see\nthat the imposition of angular ordering at the last step of the evolution leads to physically\nreasonable parton kt distributions which extend smoothly into the domain kt > \u00b5.\n3 Inclusion of ln(1\/x) effects\nWe wish to generalize the above method to include the leading ln(1\/x) contributions. Clearly\nthere can be different forms of the \u2018unified\u2019 evolution equation summing up the leading DGLAP\nand BFKL logarithms, where the ambiguity is at the subleading level. The aim is to find a\ngood prescription which is not too complicated, but which can account for all the physically\nrelevant kinematic effects just at LO level. In other words we seek an equation which sums up\nthe major part of the subleading corrections in a LO framework.\nLet us consider, for the moment, just the gluon distribution. Recall that the unintegrated\ndistribution f(x, k2t , \u00b5\n2) depends on two scales. As in the pure DGLAP case of Section 2 we wish\nto work in terms of a single-scale evolution equation, and then to restore the scale \u00b5, and the\nfull kinematics, at the last step of the evolution. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.\n6Although the splitting functions Pgq and Pqg are not singular at z = 1 it is natural to use the same\nprescription for both the quark and the gluon distributions.\n7In equation (3), \u2206 = k\u2032t\/(\u00b5+ k\n\u2032\nt) is the appropriate cut-off for z\n\u2032.\n4\nfa (x,kt2,\u00b52)\nha\u2032(x\u2032,kt\u20322)\n\u00b5 dependence\nfrom last step\nsingle-scale\nevolution\nFigure 1: An illustration of our procedure, in which the evolution of a single-scale unintegrated\nparton is followed by a final step of the ladder which introduces dependence on the second hard\nscale, \u00b5.\nFor an analysis which incorporates BFKL effects, the appropriate single-scale distribution is\nthe auxiliary function\nh(x, k2t ) =\n\u2202(xg(x, k2t ))\n\u2202 ln k2t\n. (7)\nNote that h(x, k2t ) is precisely the function which satisfies the BFKL equation in the low x\nlimit.\nBoth BFKL and DGLAP evolution correspond to angular ordering of the emission angles,\nand are single-scale equations. At LO, strong angular ordering automatically comes either from\nstrong ordering in x (z \u226a 1) for BFKL or from strong kt ordering (k\n\u20322\nt \u226a k\n2\nt ) for DGLAP. For\nthe unintegrated gluon, we face a problem when kt \u223c \u00b5 in the DGLAP framework, and similarly\nwe have a problem when z \u223c 1 for BFKL. Following the procedure of Ref. [6], we first neglect\nthe subleading kt \u223c \u00b5 and z \u223c 1 effects to obtain and solve a unified BFKL\/DGLAP equation\nfor h(x, k2t ). Then, in the last step of the evolution, we take account of the precise kinematics\nso that the kt \u223c \u00b5 and z \u223c 1 domains are treated correctly.\nThe unified equation for hg, which closely follows that presented in Ref. [4], takes the form\nhg(x, \u00b5\n2) = h0g(x, \u00b5\n2) +\n\u03b1S(\u00b5\n2)\n2pi\n\u222b 1\n0\ndz\n\u222b \u00b52\nk2\n0\ndk\u20322t\nk\u20322t\n[\n\u0398(z \u2212 x) P\u00af (z) hg\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n\u2212 zPgg(z) hg(x, k\n\u20322\nt ) + \u0398(z \u2212 x) Pgq(z)\n\u2211\nhq\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n\u2212 Pgq(z)\n\u2211\nhq(x, k\n\u20322\nt )\n]\n+\n\u03b1S(\u00b5\n2)\n2pi\n2NC\n\u222b 1\nx\ndz\nz\n\u222b\nk2\n0\ndq2\nq2\n\u0398(k\u20322t \u2212 k\n2\n0)\n[\n\u0398(\u00b52 \u2212 zq2)\n\u00b52\nk\u20322t\nhg\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n\u2212 \u0398(\u00b52 \u2212 q2) hg\n(\nx\nz\n, \u00b52\n)]\n, (8)\nwhere k\u2032t = kt + (1\u2212 z)q, see Fig. 2.\n5\nxn\nxn-1 = xn \/ zn\nxn-2 = xn-1 \/ zn-1\nktn\nqtn\nkt,n-1\nqt,n-1\nkt,n-2\nFigure 2: part of the evolution chain. We commonly write kt for ktn and then the parent\u2019s\ntransverse momentum as k\u2032t. The radiated transverse momentum is qt. Unified evolution is\nnaturally performed [5] in terms of the rescaled transverse momentum qn = qtn\/(1\u2212 zn).\nWe have introduced single-scale unintegrated quark auxiliary functions hq(x, \u00b5\n2) on the\nsame footing as hg,\nhq(x, \u00b5\n2) =\n\u2202(xq(x, \u00b52))\n\u2202 ln\u00b52\n, (9)\nand in (8) we sum over all 2nF active flavours q of quarks and antiquarks with mq < \u00b5.

The last\nterm of (8) is the BFKL contribution which sums up all the leading (\u03b1S ln 1\/x)\nn terms, while\nthe remaining terms on the right-hand-side describe the conventional DGLAP evolution of the\ngluon distribution with respect to scale \u00b52. To avoid double counting, we have excluded the\nsingular part of the Pgg splitting function in the real emission DGLAP term and used\nP\u00af (z) = Pgg(z) \u2212\n2NC\nz\n. (11)\nThe 2NC\/z term is already included in the BFKL contribution to (8).\n6\nThe driving terms, h0, which describe the low k2t < k\n2\n0 domain are given by [4]\nh0g(x, \u00b5\n2) =\n\u03b1S(\u00b5\n2)\n2pi\n\u222b 1\n0\ndz\n{\n\u0398(z \u2212 x)\n[\nPgg(z)\nx\nz\ng\n(\nx\nz\n, k20\n)\n+ Pgq(z)\n\u2211 x\nz\nq\n(\nx\nz\n, k20\n)]\n\u2212 zPgg(z) xg(x, k\n2\n0) \u2212 Pgq(z)\n\u2211\nxq(x, k20)\n}\n,\n(12)\nand similarly for h0q . The integrated input distributions a(x, k\n2\n0) are not known and, as usual,\nmust be determined from the data or from some non-perturbative QCD model.\nWe emphasize that in the unified BFKL\/DGLAP equation we choose the scale \u00b5 to be kt\nfor the DGLAP contribution, to be consistent with the BFKL term (which is independent of \u00b5\nat LO). Recall that angular ordering leads to a redefinition of the scale [1, 5]\n\u0398(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032) \u21d2 \u00b5 > zkt\/(1\u2212 z).\nIf this modified scale were to be adopted then it would be impossible to obtain a simple one-\nscale unified evolution equation throughout the whole x, k2t domain. On the other hand, within\nthe LO framework, we may omit the z dependence in the scale, so that the DGLAP part of\nthe evolution becomes ordered in transverse momenta. We stress again that it is sufficient to\nimplement the precise constraints coming from angular ordering (relevant to the z \u223c 0 and 1\ndomains for the BFKL and DGLAP terms respectively) at the last step of the evolution.\nAn advantage of the single-scale unified BFKL\/DGLAP equation is that it is straightforward\nto incorporate a major (kinematical) part of the subleading order ln(1\/x) (BFKL) effects8\nby imposing a consistency condition to ensure that the virtuality of the exchanged gluon is\ndominated by its transverse momentum squared [7]. This is achieved by the inclusion of the\ntheta function \u0398(\u00b52\u2212zq2) in the real emission contribution shown in the last term of (8). Note\nthat other subleading effects arising from using the complete DGLAP splitting function and\nrunning \u03b1S are automatically included in the unified equation.\nWe see that the evolution equations for the auxiliary distributions ha(x, k\n2\nt ) depend on the\nsingle scale k2t . The dependence of the unintegrated distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) on the second\nscale \u00b5 will enter when we consider the last step of the evolution. It is sufficient to ensure that\nthe final emitted parton explicitly satisfies the requirements of angular ordering. The angular\nordering conditions of the previous steps of the evolution are automatically ensured at LO by\nvirtue of either the strong ordering in kt (in the DGLAP part) or the strong ordering in z (in\nthe BFKL part).\nTo ensure angular ordering in the last step of the evolution, we note that z is limited by\n(5). This condition implies z < \u00b5\/(\u00b5 + kt), and so we take this as the upper limit of the z\n8The large NLO BFKL corrections, which have recently been computed [8], appeared to have put the\napplication of the BFKL framework into question. However a major part of the corrections is kinematic in\norigin and, when summed to all orders [7] using the theta function \u0398(\u00b52 \u2212 zq2), brings the BFKL approach\nback under control, see also [9, 10].\n7\nintegration in (13) and (14) below. Thus the number of gluons produced at the last step (with\ntransverse momentum kt which initiate a hard subprocess with factorization scale \u00b5) is\n9\nfg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) = Tg(kt, \u00b5)\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2pi\n{\u222b \u00b5\/(\u00b5+kt)\nx\ndz\n\u222b k2\nt dk\u20322t\nk\u20322t\n[\nP\u00af (z) hg\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n+ Pgq(z)\n\u2211\nhq\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)]\n+ 2NC\n\u222b \u00b5\/(\u00b5+kt)\nx\ndz\nz\n\u222b d2q\npiq2\n[\nk2t\nk\u20322t\nhg\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n\u2212 \u0398(k2t \u2212 q\n2) hg\n(\nx\nz\n, k2t\n)]}\n, (13)\nand the number of a particular quark species q, produced at the last step, is\nfq(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) = Tq(kt, \u00b5)\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2pi\n\u222b \u00b5\/(\u00b5+kt)\nx\ndz\n\u222b k2\nt dk\u20322t\nk\u20322t\n[\nPqg(z) hg\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)\n+ Pqq(z) hq\n(\nx\nz\n, k\u20322t\n)]\n. (14)\nThis last step of the evolution is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The unintegrated distributions\nfa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) represent the number of partons \u03b4a emitted in the \u03b4 ln k2t interval from k\n2\nt to k\n2\nt+\u03b4k\n2\nt ,\nand include the factors Ta(kt, \u00b5) of (3), which give the probabilities that partons a = g, q with\ntransverse momentum kt remain untouched in the DGLAP evolution up to the factorization\n(probe) scale \u00b5. These survival probabilities Tg and Tq resum the virtual DGLAP contributions\noccurring in (8) and (10) respectively.\nIt is important to note that the function hg(x, k\n2\nt ) already includes the leading ln(1\/x)\nvirtual corrections, which have the effect of reggeizing the exchanged gluon; thus kt is the total\nmomentum transferred via the Regge gluon trajectory. Moreover, the distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2),\nevolved in the final step from the auxiliary functions ha(x, k\n2\nt ), also incorporate the virtual\nDGLAP contributions, via the survival probabilities Ta(kt, \u00b5). The final expressions, (13) and\n(14), are thus more symmetric in that all the LO virtual corrections are included. That is,\nfrom a Feynman diagram viewpoint, the function fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) corresponds to the propagator\nof a t-channel parton of transverse momentum kt, initiating a hard subprocess at scale \u00b5, in\nwhich all the LO virtual corrections to the parton distribution have been taken into account.\n4 The unintegrated gluon distribution\nWe have described how to obtain the (two-scale) unintegrated parton distributions f(x, k2t , \u00b5\n2)\nfrom the solution h(x, k2t ) of a one-scale equation which unifies DGLAP and BFKL evolution.\nThe link is (13), (14), which represent the last step of the evolution. Only at this stage does\nthe scale \u00b5 of the subprocess, initiated by f(x, k2t , \u00b5\n2), enter.\n9The low kt < k0 domain of the integrals in (13), (14) should be treated as the driving terms h\n0 in (12).\n8\nIt is informative to compare the unintegrated gluon distribution fg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) with the be-\nhaviour of the auxiliary function hg(x, k\n2\nt ). Consider first the pure BFKL limit, in which\nDGLAP evolution is neglected, that is \u03b1S ln\u00b5\n2 \u226a 1, but \u03b1S ln 1\/x >\u223c 1. Then, in (13), the\nsurvival probability Tg(kt, \u00b5) = 1 and there are no DGLAP contributions. Thus we obtain\nfg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) = hg(x, k\n2\nt ) =\n\u2202(xg(x, k2t ))\n\u2202 ln k2t\n. (15)\nThis is an expression which is frequently used at low x.\nWhen x is sufficiently large, the derivative\nha =\n\u2202(a(x, k2t ))\n\u2202 ln k2t\n(16)\nbecomes negative, even for kt <\u223c \u00b5. The reason is that the negative virtual DGLAP term exceeds\nthe real emission DGLAP contribution, which is suppressed by the large lower limit z > x in\n(8), (10), (13) and (14). After the virtual contributions are resummed into the Ta factors the\nunintegrated parton distributions remain positive everywhere.\nWe already stated in Section 2 that imposing angular ordering on the last step of \u201cDGLAP\u201d\nevolution caused the distribution to extend smoothly into the kt > \u00b5 domain. The gluons\nalso populate this domain due to BFKL diffusion in ln k2t . This raises the question of how\nmuch enhancement we find in this domain due to the inclusion of the BFKL contributions.\nTo investigate this point, we compute the unintegrated gluon distribution fg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) in two\ndifferent ways.\n(a) In the first approach, the function hg(x, k\n2) of Ref. [4] is used as the auxiliary func-\ntion to drive the last-step evolution in (13) and (14). This incorporates essentially\nmaximal BFKL effects.10\n(b) In the second case, we use unintegrated \u201cDGLAP\u201d partons to drive the two-scale\nunintegrated fa via (4). This approach is essentially pure DGLAP, but with the\ncrucial modification that the cut-off in (3) and (4) is motivated by angular ordering.\nHere we use the MRST99 [11] set of partons as input.\nIdeally, we should refit to the deep inelastic and related scattering data and perform global\nunintegrated parton analyses11 in terms of fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2), since now we have added an extra last\nstep to the evolution. However, such global analyses are beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe unintegrated gluon distribution fg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2), obtained by the two alternative procedures\n(a) and (b), is shown in Fig. 3 for \u00b5 = 10 GeV. We can compare the continuous curves\n10In comparison with (10), the evolution of hq in Ref. [4] contains some resummation of the BFKL-like leading\n(\u03b1S ln 1\/x)\nn terms.\n11In Section 5, we describe the theoretical calculation of F2, the most important observable for constraining\nparton sets, from the two-scale unintegrated fg and fq.\n9\nof approach (a) directly with the previous unintegrated gluon distribution (dashed curves)\ncalculated in Ref. [5], which also used the same auxiliary function hg(x, k\n2\nt ) of [4] as input. For\nkt < \u00b5 the new results tend to lie above the previous determination [5], while for kt > \u00b5 they\nare increasingly smaller as kt increases. In the present work, the decrease at large kt arises\nfrom the restriction z < zmax = \u00b5\/(\u00b5 + kt), whereas the earlier calculation, based on eq. (23)\nof Ref. [5], omitted the limit z < zmax on the BFKL contribution, which causes fg to increase\nin the large kt domain at small values of x.\nFinally we compare the DGLAP-like unintegrated gluon, obtained in approach (b), with\nthat of approach (a) which embodied BFKL evolution. That is we compare the dotted with\nthe continuous curves of Fig. 3. It is interesting to note that, with the more precise angular-\nordered (CCFM [1]) cut-off from (5), \u2206 = kt\/(\u00b5+ kt), the unintegrated gluon distribution (b)\ngenerated from (4) using the pure DGLAP MRST99 [11] partons turns out to be very similar\nto the result (a) obtained using the auxiliary function hg. This coincidence can be explained by\nthe facts (i) that both the DGLAP partons and the analysis of Ref. [4] (which yielded hg) fit the\ndeep inelastic data well, and (ii) that both these input are used with the same angular-ordered\nconstraint, (5). We draw the conclusion that the role of angular ordering in the last step of\nevolution is particularly important, even more so than BFKL effects in the HERA domain.\n5 F2 calculated from the unintegrated partons\nTo check the reliability of our unintegrated parton distributions, and to demonstrate how to\nuse these distributions in calculations of observables, we compute the deep inelastic structure\nfunction F2. We wish to treat the unintegrated gluons and unintegrated quarks on an equal\nfooting as input to the subprocess cross sections, so we explicitly separate gluon and (direct)\nquark contributions to F2.\nThe gluon contributes to F2 via the quark box and crossed-box diagrams of Fig. 4.

Following Ref. [4], we choose\nthe scale \u00b5 which controls the unintegrated gluon distribution and the QCD coupling \u03b1S to be\n\u00b52 = k2t + \u03ba\n2\nt + m\n2\nq. (22)\nCare is needed in separating this calculation into perturbative and non-perturbative regions.\nWe impose a cut-off kt > k0 for a legitimate perturbative calculation of (18). The smallest cut-\noff we can choose is the minimum (that is, initial) scale of the function hg(x, k\n2\nt ) from which\nour two-scale distributions derive. Thus k0 is of order 1 GeV. For the contribution from the\n12\nregion of kt < k0 we approximate\n\u222b k2\n0\n0\ndk2t\nk2t\nfg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2)\n[\nremainder\nk2t\n]\n\u2243 xg(x, k20) Tg(k0, \u00b5)\n[ ]\nkt=a\n, (23)\nwhere a can be taken to be any value representative of the interval (0, k0). The dependence on\nthe choice of a is numerically unimportant.\nNow we have to add the direct quark contributions to F2, which come from the unintegrated\nquark distributions fq(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2). If a quark, initially with x\/z and perturbative transverse\nmomentum k\u2032t > k0, splits to a radiated gluon and a \u2018final\u2019\n12 quark with Bjorken x and transverse\nmomentum \u03bat, then this final quark can couple to the photon and contribute to F2 as:\nF\nq(pert)\n2 (x,Q\n2) =\n\u2211\nq\ne2q\n\u222b Q2\nk2\n0\nd\u03ba2t\n\u03ba2t\n\u03b1S(\u03ba\n2\nt )\n2pi\n\u222b \u03ba2\nt\nk2\n0\ndk2t\nk2t\n\u222b Q\/(Q+kt)\nx\ndz\n[\nfq\n(\nx\nz\n, k2t , Q\n2\n)\n+ fq\u00af\n(\nx\nz\n, k2t , Q\n2\n)]\nPqq(z). (24)\nwhere here we have written the antiquark contribution explicitly. As in (14), the upper limit\nof the z integration reflects the angular-ordered constraint of (5) during the quark evolution.\nAgain we need to account for the non-perturbative domain kt < k0. The initial (integrated)\nquark distribution xq(x, k20) drives our final contribution. Physically the only remaining dia-\ngrams that we have not included are those in which a quark (or antiquark) from this initial dis-\ntribution does not experience real splitting in the perturbative domain, but interacts unchanged\nwith the photon at scale Q. Hence we write a Sudakov-like factor Tq(k0, Q) to represent the\nprobability of evolution from k0 to Q without radiation.\nF\nq(non\u2212pert)\n2 (x,Q\n2) =\n\u2211\nq\ne2q\n(\nxq(x, k20) + xq\u00af(x, k\n2\n0)\n)\nTq(k0, Q). (25)\nTo avoid double counting, it is important to put a lower limit on \u03bat in both (18) and (24),\nby enforcing \u0398(\u03ba2t \u2212 k\n2\n0) in the integrations. Without this lower limit on the final transverse\nmomentum \u03bat, equations (18) and (24) would partially include low transverse momentum \u03bat\nquark contributions which are best incorporated in (25), whether they originate from partons\nwith kt > k0 or not.\nThe structure function F2(x,Q\n2) is given by the sum of the gluon-initiated contribution (17),\nand the quark terms, (24) and (25). In Fig. 5 sample results13, shown by the continuous curves,\nare compared with deep-inelastic structure function data. The gluon and quark components are\nshown by the dashed and dotted curves respectively. As expected the dominant contribution\nat small x comes from the unintegrated gluon via the quark box and crossed-box contributions,\nwhereas at large x the quark terms dominate.\n12By \u2018final\u2019 we mean the struck quark just after the Pqq splitting.\n13We show in Fig. 5 results obtained using the unintegrated distributions evaluated from (4) with the MRST99\npartons [11], that is, version (b) of fg and fq as discussed in Section 4.\n13\nWe emphasize that, in the present work, the curves for F2 are not the result of a fit to the\nstructure function data. Rather they have been obtained by using single-scale functions, origi-\nnally fitted more directly to F2 data, as plausible input to our \u2018last-step\u2019 evolution procedure,\nwhich generates two-scale unintegrated distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2). Then we use the uninte-\ngrated distributions to compute F2 via (17), (24) and (25). For the inclusive observable F2, we\nwould expect that the insertion of this extra evolution step would not appreciably disturb the\ndescription, since it essentially redistributes the distributions in kt space. We see from Fig. 5\nthat indeed this is the case.\n6 Relation of f to integrated partons\nIt is important to scrutinise the relationship between the new unintegrated partons fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2)\nand the conventional integrated parton distributions a(x, \u00b52), as obtained in global analyses\nsuch as [11]. First we emphasize that we may use either the integrated distributions or the\nunintegrated distributions to describe both inclusive (like F2) and exclusive processes. The\nframework based on the unintegrated distributions is a bit more complicated. However it\naccounts for the precise kinematics of the process and an important part of the virtual loop\ncorrections, via the survival factor T , even at LO. On the other hand, if we work with integrated\npartons we have to include NLO (and sometimes NNLO) contributions to account for these ef-\nfects. These differences appear to cause a discrepancy between the integrated and unintegrated\napproaches. As we explain below, this is to be expected since it arises from simplifications of\nthe LO formalism due to the neglect of terms which are moved into the NLO contribution.\nAn important equation, sometimes cited as the defining property of unintegrated partons\n[5], is\na(x, \u00b52) =\n\u222b \u00b52 dk2t\nk2t\nfa\n(\nx, k2t , \u00b5\n2\n)\n, (26)\nwhere a represents xg or xq. This is in fact the first equation of Ref. [5]. In the BFKL limit,\nthe \u00b5 dependence of f vanishes and we have fg(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) \u2192 hg(x, k\n2\nt ) as in (15). In this case,\n(26) is clearly satisfied. However, in general the situation is complicated by the two separate\nmomentum scales kt and \u00b5. The unintegrated partons fg of Ref. [5] were explicitly constructed\nto have the property (26), in the sense that the integral of fg over the transverse momentum up\nto the scale \u00b5 would be the same as the integral of the input auxiliary function hg(x, k\n2\nt ) up to\nthe same scale. In contrast, numerical integration over kt of the new unintegrated partons fg\nand fq presented in this paper (both versions (a) and (b) of Section 4) shows that (26) is only\napproximately true.14 We typically find a discrepancy of order 25% between the right-hand\nside of (26) and the single-scale distribution that has been used to generate fa.\n14Note that we cannot compute (26) as it is written, because we can only define the unintegrated function in\nthe regime of perturbative kt > k0. The comparison that is made is between the integral from k\n2\n0 to \u00b5\n2 and the\nquantity a(x, \u00b52)\u2212 a(x, k20).\n14\n)2\n(x,\nQ\n2F\n0\n1\n2\n2\n= 27 GeV 2Q\nZEUS (stat. only)\nNMC\n(stat.)\n2\n= 90 GeV 2Q\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\n0\n1\n2\n2\n= 250 GeV 2Q\n1\nx  \n10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 1\n2\n= 800 GeV 2Q\nH1 (stat.\n+syst.)\nFigure 5: This is not a fit but the results of using our \u201cDGLAP\u201d unintegrated partons (b)\nto calculate F2; the gluon-originated contributions are shown as dashed lines and the quark-\noriginated parts are shown as dotted lines. Recent data are plotted [13], and compare well with\nthe sum of the gluon and quark contributions (solid curves), especially at high Q2.\n15\nIn order to eliminate the discrepancy we may adjust the upper limit \u00b52 of the integral\nin (26) to c2\u00b52. The introduction of c is equivalent to a NLO correction for the integrated\npartons. Typically in the \u201cDGLAP\u201d case (approach (b) of Section 4) we require c = 0.6\u2212 0.8\nto reproduce15 the original MRST integrated gluon in the domain \u00b5 = 5\u221210 GeV and x <\u223c 0.01\n(and c \u2248 0.4 for approach (a), which embodies BFKL effects). A value c < 1 compensates for\nthe over-large virtual loop correction included in the integrated DGLAP partons on account of\nthe absence of the cut-off \u2206 in the integral over z\u2032. At smaller values of x the corrections due\nto the cut-off are mainly cancelled between the virtual and real DGLAP contributions. As x\nincreases, the virtual contribution (the second term on the right-hand-side of (1)) increasingly\ndominates and we have to choose smaller values of c. Eventually in the domain x > 0.1,\n\u00b5 \u223c 10 GeV the main contribution comes from the input and to compensate the absence of the\nz cut-off in the conventional form of the DGLAP equation we must change the input itself.\nTo summarize, the discrepancy between the integral (26) of the unintegrated parton function\nand the original integrated distribution is not a cause for concern. Conceptually, there are two\ndifferent roles for single-scale distributions in the description of data for inclusive observables\n(where partonic transverse momentum is integrated out). The first role is the traditional one, in\nthe framework of collinear factorization, whereby integrated parton distribution functions are\nfitted directly to the data. The second role is demonstrated in this paper (following [6] and [5]),\nwhere we use single-scale functions as input to the last-step procedure, see for example (4). We\nhave been forced to introduce a new formalism for calculating F2(x,Q\n2), in which unintegrated\nparton functions are understood to be the fundamental objects; we have emphasized the need\nto perform a new global fit to data in terms of the new functions fa. After this, we do not\nexpect the input single-scale function a on the left-hand side of (26) to equal the integral of\nfa up to \u00b5\n2, since a itself is not fitted directly to the data, but rather is used as input for the\nlast step of the evolution, which embodies a crucial angular-ordering constraint unique to this\nlast step. Thus our single-scale or \u2018auxiliary\u2019 function is not a traditional parton distribution\nfunction, but simply an intermediate function.\n7 Conclusions\nParton distributions, fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) unintegrated over the parton kt are the basic quantities for\ndescribing processes initiated by hadrons. An essential ingredient in this description is the\nexistence of the kt factorization theorem [14]. The unintegrated distributions depend on two\nhard scales \u2014 the transverse momentum kt and the factorization scale \u00b5. The scale \u00b5 drives the\nangular ordering during the evolution which arises from the coherence of the gluon emissions.\nHere we develop a new formalism to determine the unintegrated parton distributions,\nfa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2), which embodies both the leading lnQ2 (DGLAP) and ln 1\/x (BFKL) effects,\n15This identification is only approximate since the last step of the evolution is not included in the comparison.\n16\nas well as including a major part of the sub-leading ln 1\/x contributions. An important ob-\nservation is that, at leading order, the two-scale functions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) may be calculated from\nauxiliary functions ha(x, k\n2\nt ) which satisfy single-scale evolution equations, since the angular\nordering restrictions, controlled by \u00b5, become important only at the last step of the evolution.\nThe equation for the auxiliary function hg(x, k\n2\nt ) was formulated, and the distributions fitted\nto the data, in Ref. [4]. These single-scale equations were also devised to include all the leading\n\u03b1S lnQ\n2 and \u03b1S ln 1\/x contributions, and a major part of the sub-leading ln 1\/x effects.\nIn other words, the \u2018unified\u2019 evolution equations for h must be supplemented by a final\nevolution step in which the \u00b5 dependence of the unintegrated parton distributions enters via\nthe angular-ordering constraint. The situation is summarised diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The\nprocedure offers a considerable simplification in the determination of physically realistic un-\nintegrated parton distributions fa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) over the full x, \u00b52 perturbative domain, including\nthe true kinematics even at leading order. As expected, the gluon and sea quark distributions\nextend into the kt > \u00b5 region more and more as x decreases. We have compared the new\nunintegrated distributions with those given by previous prescriptions [6, 5]. As compared to\nRef. [5], the new formalism gives a consistent treatment of angular ordering, which leads to\nthe imposition of the z integration limit z < \u00b5\/(\u00b5 + kt). As a consequence the distributions\nfa(x, k\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) decrease faster than those of [5] for large kt, particularly at small x. An interesting\nresult is that the unintegrated distributions obtained via ha(x, k\n2\nt ) of [4] are not very different\nfrom those obtained via (4) using conventional DGLAP partons \u2014 compare the continuous and\ndotted curves in Fig. 3. It thus appears that the imposition of the angular-ordering constraint\nis more important than the BFKL effects. This observation has the practical consequence that\nreasonably accurate predictions for observables can be made using the much simpler, though\nless complete, prescription of (4).\nFinally, we used the new unintegrated distributions to calculate the deep-inelastic structure\nfunction F2. We also showed the gluon-initiated and quark contributions separately, which, as\nexpected, dominate at small x and large x respectively. Recall, from [4], that the rise of the\ngluon at small x is driven by perturbative QCD, which was assumed to have a non-perturbative\ninput which is \u2018flat\u2019 in x. We emphasize that we have not fitted to the deep inelastic data.\nNevertheless, Fig. 5 shows that the existing distributions give an adequate description, and\ntherefore they may be used to evaluate other hard processes, such as bb\u00af and large qt prompt\nphoton production in high energy pp\u00af (or pp) collisions. It is important to use unintegrated\ndistributions for such exclusive reactions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Jan Kwiecinski and Anna Stasto for many valuable discussions during the course of\nthis research.
