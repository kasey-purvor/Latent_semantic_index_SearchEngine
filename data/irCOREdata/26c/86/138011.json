There are a \nvariety of methods for the preparation of PZT powder. Mechanochemical \nsynthesis [2]-[5], chemical synthesis [6]-[10] or hydrothermal synthesis [11]-\n[14] has each been successfully used. \nProcessing routes for the production of monodispersed fine powders \nare becoming increasingly common. TiO2, ZrO2 and SiO2 were some of the \nfirst powders to have been successfully created [15]-[19] with the sol-gel \ntechnique. The synthetic methods used to prepare these materials involve \nfairly simple solution chemistry, however they give a high degree of control \nand reproducibility. \nHowever, it is more difficult to create monodispersed particles with two \nor more metallic elements because of the tendency of one of the metal \nalkoxides to precipitate out of the solution more quickly than the other. This is \nowing to differences in hydrolysis rates of the alkoxides. \nA sol-gel technique has previously been used by several authors [20]-\n[26] to create a PZT powder. \nIn this paper a new sol-gel route for PZT, incorporating \npolyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP, is presented. PVP has previously been used with \nsuccess for the creation of crack free thick, and thin films [27]-[28] and in \n 3 \nsome cases to improve the properties of the final powders [29]-[30]. In this \nstudy PVP, was used both to create a PZT-PVP sol and also as a secondary \nstage to control the particle size of the powder produced.  \n The advantage of this new sol-gel route is the capability of producing \ncontrolled nano-scale ceramic powder with specific crystalline phase. \n \n \nExperimental \n \nThe preparation route of the Pb1.0Zr0.9Ti0.1-PVP gel (i) is shown in \nFigure 1.  \nTo produce 160 ml of sol, the following route was used. 12.14 g of \nlead(II) acetate trihydrate was left under vacuum at 100 oC for 24 hours to \nremove the water. 12.21 g of zirconium(IV) propoxide, 76.33% by weight in n-\npropanol, and 0.9 g of titanium(IV) isopropoxide were dissolved in 120 ml \nisopropanol. This mixture was heated to 80 oC under stirring. After three hours \nthe lead(II) acetate was added. The mixture was stirred for another three \nhours under the same conditions. Extra isopropanol was added until the final \nvolume of the solution reached the 160 ml. A light-transparent PZT sol was \nobtained. To transform this into a PZT-PVP sol, 5.5 g of PVP with average \nmolecular weight of 1 300 000 were added and the stirring was continued until \nit became clear yellow in colour.  \nThe resulting PZT-PVP sol had a concentration of 0.2 M of lead. The \nPb(OAc)2 : PVP weight ratio of the sol was 1 : 0.5. In order to hydrolyse this to \nproduce a gel, water was slowly added up to the maximum of [H2O]\/[Pb] = \n0.66. A PZT-PVP gel, gel (i), was obtained.  \n 4 \nSubsequent to these common processing steps, two processing \nroutes, here called A and B were followed. \nPowder preparation route A is shown in Figure 2a. The PZT-PVP gel (i) \nwas left to dry at 60 oC for 144 h and then burnt out at 500 oC for 1h. An \norange coloured powder was created.  \nPowder preparation route B is shown in Figure 2b. The PZT-PVP gel (i) \nwas stirred for 10 min at 1200 rpm, and then 0.2 g of PVP with average \nmolecular weight 55 000 was added per millilitre of sol. The new PZT-PVP \ngel, gel (ii), was dried at 60 oC for 144 h and then heat treated at two different \nprofiles, one at 500 oC for 1 hour and the second at 550 oC for 24 hours. \n A Philips XL series Scanning Electron Microscope and a Siemens \nD5005 X-Ray Diffractometer were used for sample analysis. \n Size measurements of the powder were performed using a Zeta-Sizer \n3000 (Malvern Instruments). Each powder before the measurements was \ndiluted in water and left in an ultrasound bath for 40 min. \nDifferential scanning calorimetry of the gels was performed using a \nmodulated DSC (TA Instruments) model 2920. A constant heating rate of 10 \noC min-1 from 20 to 450 oC was used, with an isothermal dwell at 450 oC for \n60 min. All the measurements took place under a constant nitrogen flow. \nHermetic aluminium pans were used to encapsulate the samples. \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 \nResults \n \nFigures 3a - 3b are SEM micrographs of typical PZT powder that was \nproduced using route A. In Figure 3a non-spherical particulates of the order of \n10 \u00b5m in size can be observed. Figure 3b shows a higher magnification \nmicrograph of the surface of a particulate. It indicates that the 10 \u00b5m sized \nagglomerates are composed of primary particles of particle size 30-70nm. \nFigure 3c is a volume percent against particle diameter histogram of \nPZT powder that was produced with route A. The diagram show that almost \n90 % in volume of the powder consisted of particles with diameter above 5 \u00b5m \nand only 10 % in volume of the powder consists from sub-micron particles. \nFigures 4a - 4b are SEM micrographs of examples of PZT powder that \nwas produced using route B and subsequently heat treated at 500 oC for 1h. \nIn Figure 4a, particle agglomerates of up to 3\u00b5m in size with an approximately \nequiaxed shape can be observed. Figure 4b shows a higher magnification \nmicrograph of free standing agglomerates with diameter 50 - 200 nm and \nprimary particle size 30 - 50nm. \nFigure 4c is a particle diameter histogram of PZT powder that was \nproduced using route B and subsequently heat treated at 500 oC for 1h. The \ndiagram shows that only sub-micron particle formations were detectable in the \nsuspension. The average diameter of particles formations in water is around \n250 nm. \n  Figures 5a - 5b are SEM micrographs of examples of PZT powder that \nwas produced using route B and heat treated at 550 oC for 24h. Figure 5a \nshows agglomerates up to 2\u00b5m in diameter with approximately equiaxed \n 6 \nshape. The higher magnification micrograph, Figure 5b, shows agglomerated \nprimary particles with a primary particle size similar to the 500 oC heat treated \npowder. \n Figure 5c is a particle diameter histogram of PZT powder that was \nproduced using route B and heat treated at 550 oC for 24h. The diagram \nshows that around 95 % of the total volume of the powder consist from sub-\nmicron formations with mean diameter around 350 nm. About 5 % of the \npowder volume consists from particles with size 2-3 \u00b5m.  \nFigures 6a \u2013 6c are XRD diagrams of PZT powders that were produced \nwith routes A and B. In Figure 6a a XRD diagram of PZT powder produced \nwith route A and heat treated at 500 oC for 1h is presented. Comparison with \nthe peaks for pyrochlore and perovskite shows that this route powder is a \nmixture of pyrochlore and perovskite phases. Figure 6b is a XRD diagram of \nPZT powder produced with route B and heat treated at 500 oC for 1h. This is \nmainly pyrochlore with very little perovskite phase present.  In Figure 6c, a \nXRD diagram of PZT powder produced with route B and heat treated at 550 \noC for 24h is presented. The XRD peaks show that this heat treatment gave a \npowder with perovskite phase only. \nFigures 7a shows heat flow against time curves for the PZT sol and the \n1 300 000 MW PVP respectively. The PZT-sol exhibits a shallow endothermic \npeak between 50\u2013140 oC followed by two broad exothermic peaks, one at \n310\u2013350 oC and the second at 420\u2013450 oC. The 1 300 000 MW PVP, exhibits \ntwo endothermic peaks one at 50-100 oC and the second at 420-440 oC. \nFigure 7b shows heat flow diagrams for Gel (i) and Gel (ii). Gel (i) exhibits two \nexothermic peaks one at 320\u2013370 oC and the second at 410\u2013450 oC. Gel (ii) \n 7 \nalso exhibits two endothermic peaks, one at 40-150 oC, and the second at \n410\u2013450 oC, as well as two exothermic peaks, the first at 320\u2013370 oC and the \nsecond at 420-450 oC.  \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nFrom the SEM micrographs it can be observed that all three powders \nhave the same size range of primary particles diameter 30-50 nm. It can be \nconcluded that the extra polymer that was added in the secondary process \nstage did not significantly affect the size of the primary particles. However, a \ncomparison of figures 3a, 3c and 4a, 4c indicates that the second addition of \npolymer significantly reduces the agglomerate size.  \nComparing the results, it can be hypothesised that by adding extra \npolymer, as a secondary stage, the PZT particles in the gel were immobilized. \nAs a consequence of this immobilization, the particles were hindered from \nreacting and creating agglomerated formations of larger particles during the \ndrying and burn out steps. C=O groups of PVP are known to be strongly \nbonded with OH groups of the metalloxane polymers via hydrogen bonding \n[31][32]. Such C=O groups can be regarded as the \u201ccapping agent\u201d for the OH \ngroups of the metalloxane polymers, obstructing the condensation reaction. \nA comparison between XRD figures 6a and 6b shows that similar \nconditions in the burn out stage resulted in powders with different crystalline \nphases. The PZT powder that was produced with route A gave a mixture of \npyrochlore and perovskite phases. The powder that was produced with route \n 8 \nB did not produce a detectable perovskite phase. These results indicate that \nan extra amount of PVP can delay the formation of the perovskite phase.  \nA similar comparison between XRD figures 6b and 6c shows that for \nthe route B powder an increase in the burn out temperature and time \nproduced a completely perovskite phase in the PZT. A comparison of the \nprimary particles morphology in Figures 4b and 5b indicates that the \nproduction of the perovskite phase was not at the expense of significant initial \nsintering of the powder. Figures 4c and 5c show that the increase in the burn \nout temperature also effects the particle population. The average diameter of \nthe sub-micron particles was increased. Particle formations with diameter \nabove 1 \u00b5m were created. This behaviour can be explained by taking in \nconsideration the local sintering that is noticeable in figure 5b. Figure 5b \nshows that the particles with smother surfaces have also created bridges with \ntheir neighbour particles. These hard agglomerates would be correlated with \nthe new population of micron-scale particles. \nThe role of the PVP in the sol-gel process was investigated using DSC. \nThe common endothermic peak, in Figures 7a and 7b, at 30\u2013150 oC \ncorresponds to the evaporation of the solvent and the water. The exothermic \npeak, at 310\u2013370 oC, is common to all the PZT containing samples and is \nlikely to correspond to the decomposition of the organic species. The \nexothermic peak exhibited by the PZT sol [Figure 7a] between 420-450 oC is \nlikely to be caused by the formation of a metastable pyrochlore phase \naccompanied by the remaining combustion of the organics [33]-[35].  \nThe endothermic peak at 420-450 oC exhibited by the PVP in Figure 7a \ncorresponds to the melting point of the polymer. Gel (i) also has an \n 9 \nexothermic peak in the temperature range 420\u2013450 oC but the total released \nenergy was much greater than for the PZT sol sample. This indicates the \npresence of a different mechanism. The breaking of the hydrogen bonds \nbetween the C=O groups of PVP and the OH groups of the metalloxane \npolymers is likely to provided the extra energy. Gel (ii) exhibits the same \nbehaviour as Gel (i), except for an endothermic peak at 410\u2013450 oC. The \nextra amount of polymer, added in the secondary stage, for Gel (ii) is likely to \naccount for this. \n The DSC results indicate that the first stage polymer created bonds \nwith the alkoxides and controlled the speed of the condensation reaction. \nHowever, the SEM pictures show that the first stage polymer was not able to \nprevent agglomeration during the drying process. The second stage polymer \nwas necessary to complete the encapsulation of the first stage PZT particles \nand prevent them from further reaction during the drying and burn out stage. \n \n \nConclusions \n \n Two sol-gel routes were used to create PZT powder. Both gave similar \nprimary particles sizes and morphologies but different agglomerate \nformations. The extra amount of polymer that was added as a secondary \nstage prevented the formation of large agglomerates and created a powder \nwith sub-micron primary particles. The amount of polymer in the PZT-PVP gel \nappears to be able to affect the final crystal phase of powder without affecting \nsignificantly the size of the freestanding particles.  \n \n 10 \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n This work would not have been possible without the financial support \nfrom EPSRC [grant No: GR\/R43303].
