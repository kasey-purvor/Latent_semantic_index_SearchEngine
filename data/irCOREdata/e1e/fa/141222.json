Introduction \n \nFor the past three decades MIP technology has been developed as a method for the \npreparation of synthetic receptors by polymerisation of a self-assembled complex, formed \nby functional monomers and template [1]. Traditionally the choice of polymer \ncomposition is based on information available from the literature about the behaviour of \nsimilar systems, individual experience of chemists or extensive experimental trials. \nAlthough many polymers perform effectively in separation and sensing [2-5], some \npractical applications have the need for a fast procedure, MIP \u201cdialling\u201d, when a polymer \nhas to be designed and tested within a short period of time (2-4 weeks) to address a \nspecific separation problem. \u201cDialling\u201d obviously requires the development of a generic \nprotocol for MIP design and testing. The first attempt to develop such a protocol was \nmade using a combinatorial screening approach [6]. The method describes the \ndevelopment of a monomer library, synthesis of MIPs using these monomers and their \n 3\ntesting in re-binding experiments. As a result it was possible to select monomers from the \nlibrary, which produced polymers with the highest affinity for the template. Although the \nmethod showed its usefulness for the screening of small sets of the polymers it has \nlimited applicability for the testing of large libraries of polymers containing two or more \nmonomers. The number of polymers which can be produced using a combination of two \nmonomers is equal to: A=(n2+n)\/2 where A is the number of polymers and n is the \nnumber of monomers in the library. If a library contains 100 monomers, more than 5 \nthousands polymers will have to be synthesised and tested, which is an enormous task. \nAlthough automation of the process using robots could resolve this problem partially [7], \nin practice the synthesis and screening of large libraries of polymers remains difficult for \nusing in routine applications. \n Recently we developed a generic protocol for MIP design using a computational \napproach and molecular modelling software [8-10]. The idea is to simulate a complex \nformation between the monomers and template in a monomer mixture. A virtual library \nof the most commonly used functional monomers is designed and screened for their \ninteraction with the template. This selection covers practically all variety of commercially \navailable monomers capable to interact with a template through electrostatic, \nhydrophobic Van-der-Waals forces and dipole-dipole interactions (Figure 1). \n Simulated annealing is used to analyse the organisation of the monomers around \nthe template molecule. At the end of the program, the number and the position of the \nfunctional monomers are examined giving information about the optimum MIP \ncomposition. The results on the development of MIPs for atrazine, aflatoxin B1, \nmicrocystin-LR, creatinine and small-molecular-weight drugs have demonstrated the \n 4\nexcellent performance of the computational MIPs in separation and sensing. The \ncomputational method became a routine tool for design of imprinted polymers in our \nlaboratory and is now validated for use by other groups. \nOne of the important questions, which should be answered before it is \nrecommended for broad application, is how fast can the molecular modelling be done. \nThis paper describes the first attempt to use a MIP \u201cdialling\u201d protocol for fast-track \nsynthesis of polymeric adsorbents specific for tylosin and use of this adsorbent for tylosin \nrecovery and from broth samples and its purification from other related macrolides. \nTylosin is a 16-membered macrolide antibiotic produced by fermentation of \nStreptomyces fradiae which is used in veterinary practice as a therapeutic substance in \nthe treatment of Mycoplasmas, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamidia and Rickettsia \ninfections in poultry and in a livestock. Also, the group of macrolide antibiotics \nconstitutes an important alternative for patients exhibiting penicillin sensitivity and \nallergy [11]. \n During fermentation several related metabolites can be formed among which the \nmain interfering compound is tylactone (Tl) (the skeleton of tylosine), narbomycin (Nm) \nand picromycin (Pm) (Figure 2). Traditional methods for purification and analysis of \nmacrolides include reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 or polymeric stationary phase [12]. As \nit was reported, this method has disadvantages such as column dependence towards \nimpurities, long analysis time and high price of polymeric adsorbent. A strong need exists \nfor the rapid isolation of macrolides structurally related to tylosin (Ts) from broth extracts \nbased on solid-phase extraction (SPE) or a chromatographic stationary phase for \nbiotechnological manufacturing of this antibiotic. \n 5\n2. Materials and Methods \n \n2.1. Reagents \n \nTylosin, tylactone, narbomycin and picromycin were supplied by \nBiotransformations\/Natural Product Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline R&D, UK. Ethylene \nglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), itaconic acid (IA), N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide \n(BAA), acrylamide (AA), methacrylic acid (MA), 1,1\u2032-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), \ndichlormethane, ethyl acetate, trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine were purchased from \nAldrich (UK). Dimethylformamide (DMF) was obtained from BDH (UK). All chemicals \nwere analytical or HPLC grade and were used without further purification. \n \n2.2. Molecular modelling \n \nThe workstation used to simulate monomer-template interactions was a Silicon \nGraphics Octane running the IRIX 6.4 operating system. The workstation was configured \nwith two 195 MHz reduced instruction set processors, 712 MB memory and a 12 GB \nfixed drive. This system was used to execute the software packages SYBYL 6.6 (Tripos \nInc., St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The molecular model of tylosin (template) and a virtual \nlibrary of the 20 commonly used monomers (Figure 2) were created, charges for each \natom were calculated and the structure of the template was refined for dielectric constant \nequal 38 (DMF) using molecular mechanics. The LEAPFROG algorithm was used to \nscreen the library of functional monomers on their possible interactions with the \ntemplate. 30,000 iterations were completed in approximately 2 hours and results from \n 6\neach run were examined by ranking the empirical binding score. In order to estimate the \npolymer composition and monomer ratio the top three monomers giving the highest \nbinding score and thus capable of forming the strongest complexes with the template \nmolecule were selected for the Simulated Annealing process. The space around the \ntemplate was saturated with multiple copies of the selected monomers. Annealing \nconditions were fixed as 1000K-300K sweeping in 100,000 consecutive steps. \nEquilibrium length was determined as 1000 ps. Energy minimisation was performed to \n0.01 kcal mol-1 convergence for each iteration. At the end of the program, the number and \nthe position of the functional monomers were examined. The monomers participating in \nthe complex with the template were chosen for the preparation of the molecularly \nimprinted polymer. \n \n2.3. Preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers \n \nThe molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and non-imprinted (Blank) polymer \nwere synthesised using the ratio obtained by the simulated annealing. The \u201ctraditional\u201d \nMIP was synthesised using methacrylic acid as a monomer (10:1 molar ratio of monomer \ntowards the template). The composition of polymers is presented in Table 1. The amount \nof cross-linker (EGDMA) was calculated as 80% (w\/w) of the functional monomer and \ntemplate. The polymers were prepared using DMF, which was chosen as a porogen due \nto the poor solubility of the template in more hydrophobic solvents, such as chloroform \nand toluene. 1% of 1,1\u2032-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) was used to initiate the \npolymerisation. The corresponding blank polymer was prepared in the same way but in \n 7\nthe absence of the template. The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen and then left \nto polymerise overnight at 80 \u00b0C. The bulk polymers were ground in methanol with an \nelectrical mortar SL2 (Silverson, UK) and mechanically wet-sieved through 106 and 38 \n\u00b5m sieves (Endecotts, UK). The template was removed using Soxhlet extraction with \nmethanol (12 hours) followed by washing in an HPLC column with methanol and 5 min \ncycles of 50 mM NaOH in 90% methanol and 50 mM NaOH in water (9 ml\/min, 30 \ncycles). The polymer particles with a size range of 38-106 \u00b5m were collected, dried \nunder vacuum and used for solid-phase extraction experiments. The particles with size \nless than 38 \u00b5m were fractionated by sedimentation in acetonitrile and packed in 250 x \n4.7 mm columns and used for HPLC analysis. \n \n2.4. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) \n \nSPE was performed with 5 ml cartridges packed with 500 mg of MIP and Blank \npolymer in a VisiPrep 12-vial vacuum manifold (Supelco, UK) connected to a vacuum \npump (KNF Laboport, Neuberger, Germany). 0.5 ml of tylosin solutions (0.1 mg\/ml) in \nwater, 50:50 methanol\/broth, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate were loaded onto the \ncartridges followed by a methanol wash. The samples of fermented broth, spiked with \ntylosin were also used in SPE in order to explore the possibilities of the practical \napplications of the designed MIP. To optimise the elution conditions, gradients of \ndifferent concentrations of ammonia hydroxide from 0.125 M to 2 M in methanol were \nprepared. All eluted samples were analysed by HPLC using a reverse-phase C18 column \n(150x4.6 mm) with a gradient of acetonitrile in water (0-90%) containing 0.5% TFA. The \nflow rate was 1 ml\/min. Tylosin was detected spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. \n 8\n \n2.5. HPLC analysis \n \nFor the analysis of the MIP recognition properties 1g of polymer (particle size < \n38 \u00b5m) was suspended in methanol and packed into an HPLC column (100x4.6mm) \nunder reduced pressure. The evaluation experiments were carried out using an HPLC \nsystem, which included a ConstaMetric-3200 solvent delivery system (LDC Analytical, \nUK), Perkin-Elmer ISS-100 automatic injection system and a Waters Lambda-Max \nModel 481 LC Detector (UK). The separation was performed using 3% acetic acid in \nchloroform at a flow rate 2 ml\/min. Peaks were monitored optically at 280 nm. All \nreported chromatographic data represent the results of at least 3 concordant \nexperiments. The STD in the experiments was below 5%. Capacity factors (k\u2032) were \ndetermined from k\u2032= (t - to)\/to, where t is the retention time of a given species and to is \nthe retention time of the void marker (acetone). Effective separation factors (\u03b1) were \ncalculated from the relationship \u03b1= k\u2032t\/k\u2032a, where k\u2032t and k\u2032a are the capacity factors of \ntylosin and related macrolides respectively. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \nThe necessity to use computational approach for the design of MIP specific for \ntylosin originated from the fact that \u201ctraditional\u201d, methacrylic acid based imprinted \npolymer had a low affinity for the template and did not perform well in separation and \npurification of this compound (see Figure 5b). It has been anticipated since the relatively \nhigh polarity of tylosin necessitated the use of polar DMF as a solvent in polymer \n 9\npreparation, which reduces the strength of hydrogen bonds important for template \nrecognition by a polymer. Significantly better results were expected from a \u201ccocktail\u201d \npolymerisation, when a combination of monomers with different functionalities is used \nfor the polymer preparation [13]. The rational selection of a monomeric \u201ccocktail\u201d for \ntylosin recognition in this study was performed by using the computational \u201cdialling\u201d \nprocedure [9, 10]. \n \n3.1. MIP \u201cdialling\u201d protocol \n \nThe Table 2 shows the key stages used in the MIP design and preparation, \nconstituting the \u201cdialling\u201d protocol. \nObviously an analysis of the MIP performance by HPLC or SPE will contribute \nadditionally to the time spent on the project. Normally this evaluation takes 5-7 days. \n \n3.2. Polymer design \n \nThe screening of the virtual library of monomers against tylosin resulted in the \nselection of three monomers with the highest binding energy: itaconic acid (-27.70 kcal \nmol-1), N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide (-27.98 kcal mol-1) and acrylamide (-28.50 kcal \nmol-1) which were used in the subsequent simulated annealing step. This step simulates \nthe pre-arrangement of the functional monomers with the template as it exists in the \nmonomer mixture prior to polymerisation. The practical significance of this step lies in \nthe possibility to identify the best combination of functional monomers by selecting \nthose, which contribute to the interaction with the template whilst avoiding a non-\n 10\nproductive competition between them. Figure 3 shows the structure of the complex \nformed by the monomers and tylosin. In accordance with the modelling results 3 \nmolecules of itaconic acid and 2 acrylamide interact with 1 molecule of tylosin (first \nshell). Additionally 3 itaconic acids, 3 N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide and 1 acrylamide \ninteract with the first shell of monomers thus stabilising the complex (second shell). \nAccordingly the MIP was synthesised using a template monomer ratio: tylosin (1): \nitaconic acid (6): N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide (3) : acrylamide (3) (Table 1). The Blank \npolymer was synthesised using the same composition but in the absence of the template. \nBoth polymers were ground, washed and packed in SPE cartridges and HPLC columns as \ndescribed in the Materials and Methods section. In total the design and preparation of \npolymer samples took 14 days. \n \n3.2. SPE analysis \n \nSPE cartridges packed with 500 mg of polymer were tested on their ability to bind \nthe template. It was found that under neutral conditions the MIP and Blank polymers \nadsorb tylosin completely (1- 200 \u00b5g\/ml concentration) from water samples as well as \nfrom organic extracts (ethyl acetate, 50% methanol, chloroform and dichloromethane). It \nwas possible to use methanol to wash out the interfering compounds present in \nfermentation broth samples in high quantities such as lipids and tylactone (Figure 4). \nElution was performed under basic conditions. 95-100% tylosin recovery was achieved \nusing methanol with 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide. Related macrolides, narbomycin and \npicromycin, similar to tylosin, were also adsorbed completely from aqueous and organic \n 11\nsolutions by both polymers. Tylactone, an interfering compound present in the broth \nextract, adsorbed from water but passed through the polymers without retention in \norganic solvents. Elution of tylosin could also be carried out in strong acidic conditions. \nAs expected the elution conditions differed for the MIP and Blank polymer. Thus it was \npossible to achieve complete recovery of tylosin and narbomycin from the Blank polymer \nusing 3 mM trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) but the MIP needed a higher 6 mM TFA \nconcentration. Acetic acid which was dissolved in ethyl acetate (concentration range 30 \nmM - 500 mM), failed to remove analytes from the polymer, which reflects the strength \nof interactions formed between the monomers and template. \nAnalysis of the MIP and Blank polymers capacity for tylosin has showed that the \nimprinted polymer adsorbed 30-50% more tylosin (depending on conditions) than the \nBlank polymer. The polymer capacity for tylosin dissolved in buffer was estimated as 6.4 \nmg\/g (MIP) and 4.4 mg\/g (Blank). These values are acceptable for practical application \nof both MIP and Blank polymers as a stationary phase in SPE and preparative \nchromatography.  \n Experiments with tylosin adsorption from a diluted solution (1 \u00b5g\/ml) have \nconfirmed that it is possible to use both MIP and Blank polymers for sample pre-\nconcentration (the 95% recovery of tylosin was achieved with a concentration factor of \n100).  \nThe MIP performed better in recovery of tylosin from broth samples than most traditional \nSPE materials. An intriguing possibility is to use for the extraction both, aqueous and \norganic solvents. \n \n 12\n3.3 HPLC experiments \n \nIn the extraction experiments described above the MIP has not shown an \nindividual specificity for tylosin. Nevertheless under more gentle chromatographic \nconditions it was possible to separate the mixture of tylosin, picromycin, narbomycin and \ntylactone using the MIP (eluent: 3% acetic acid in chloroform) but not the Blank polymer \nand MA-based imprinted polymer (Figure 5). Even better recognition was achieved with \nthe MIP with 2% of acetic acid (Table 3), although the peaks were broad due to high \nlevel of heterogeneity of the binding sites present in MIPs [14] and also due to an \nirregular size and shape of the ground particles used for column preparation. Although it \nwas not the goal of the present study, it is important to note that potentially it is possible \nto improve the performance of the column by using smaller size particles and by applying \ngradient elution.  \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nA selective polymer for tylosin was designed, prepared and tested in a short time \n(21 days) using a computational MIP \u201cdialling\u201d approach. To perform the traditional \nscreening of 20 monomers, their possible combinations and optimisation of MIP \ncomposition, judging from our experience, would require at least ten times longer. The \ncomputationally designed MIP possessed the required affinity and specificity, which \nwere much higher than traditional and blank polymers. It was possible to recover tylosin \nquantitatively from crude broth extracts. Due to the low price and ability to work in \naqueous and organic solutions the MIP could be recommended as a new SPE resin for \n 13\nsample pre-treatment of macrolides. As a tylosin-selective polymer the MIP can also be \nused for preparative separation of tylosin from its analogues.  \n \nAcknowledgement.
