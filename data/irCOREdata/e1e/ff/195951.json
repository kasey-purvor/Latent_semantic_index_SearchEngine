Studies of both \nfamilial and sporadic IgAN strongly point to clinical and genetic heterogeneity in the entity we \npresently call IgAN. The human IgAN phenotype does not exhibit classic Mendelian inheritance \npatterns, but is better considered using the paradigm for genetically complex human autoimmune \ndiseases, for which multiple loci have been identified by family-based genetic studies. In these \ncomplex diseases many different types of genetic variations contribute to the final phenotype. \nAmong the many potential mechanisms involved, interest has recently been focused on specific \nsingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles which alter the transcriptional activity of genes \ninvolved in the pathogenesis. Recently it has been said that 30%-50% of human genes with coding \nSNPs can present allelic variation in gene expression (2). \nIn IgAN it can be assumed that there are multiple disease\/susceptibility loci that regulate \nmechanisms of IgA deposition, injury and progression. These disease loci will be detectable by \ngenome\/wide scan for linkage, however this method has limited power to detect genes of small \neffect. Variation at these loci may be further influenced by a potentially large number of modifier \ngenes with small genetic effect which lead to the final IgAN phenotypes.  \nCareful analysis of kindreds in which IgAN has high phenotypic expression has also \nsupported disease heterogeneity (3,4,5). Linkage-based approaches to the study of familial forms of \nthe disease have identified significant or suggestive loci on chromosomes 6q22-23, 2q36, 4q26-31, \n17q12-22 and 3p24-23, but no causal gene has yet been identified despite thorough analysis of these \nloci.  \nCase-control genetic association studies have yielded inconsistent results in IgAN. Gene \npolymorphisms have sometimes been pursued even when there were no data for a biologically \nplausible functional effect of the polymorphism. Even within ethnically uniform populations \nsuccessive studies of the same candidate have often been contradictory; this is now realised to be \nexplicable at least in part by hidden ancestral differences between subgroups of the same ethnic \ngroup (6) and use of haplotype block-based methods for SNP selection (7). \nIn view of the altered O-glycosylation identified as a key element in the pathogenesis of IgAN \n(8), genetic variation in the relevant glycosylating enzymes has been studied as a possible disease \nmechanism. However available data again emphasise the heterogeneity of IgAN; there are \nconflicting data for C1GALT1, the gene encoding the key enzyme \u03b21,3 Gal transferase [on \nchromosome 7p14-p13]  and C1GALT1C1 [on chromosome Xq24] encoding its chaperone protein, \nCosmc (C1GALT specific molecular chaperone). Whereas in a Chinese population with IgAN three \nSNPs of C1GALT1 have been reported in significantly different frequency in IgAN and healthy \ncontrols without differences in C1GALT1C1 (9), no association for C1GALT1 SNPs and IgAN was \nfound in French patients (Berthoux et al communication at the 2009 IgAN Symposium, Stresa, \nItaly), and the lack of differences for C1GALT1C1 was confirmed  in Caucasians  (10).  \nAs well as modifying IgA1 glycosylation, other genetic influences in the pathogenesis of \nIgAN could render IgA1 molecules more phlogistic, by increasing the synthesis of IgG \nautoantibody leading to formation of macromolecular IgA1-IgG immune complexes (11), or by \nincreasing complement activation by such complexes (12), or by modifying the affinity for IgA \nreceptors on mesangial cells (13). Thus far no candidacies have been established in these pathways. \nBesides the search for genetic factors favouring the development of IgAN, interest has \nfocused on genes conditioning the progression of IgAN, some of them likely common to the \nprogression of other renal diseases. Such genes could influence the many pathways which decide \nthe capacity of the kidney to respond to the initial IgA-mediated injury by resolution of \ninflammation or with progressive scarring, and may modify the vascular injury associated with \nhypertension and atherosclerosis which contributes to progression in many renal diseases.  \nAmong genes influencing vascular responses, the polymorphisms regulating insertion\/deletion \n(I\/D) of intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene have been most studied. This is \nsupposed to be particularly relevant in IgAN, a renal disease with local angiotensin hyperactivity \n(14). Once more the heterogeneity of IgAN emerges in a meta-analysis, which indicates that an \nassociation between the I\/D ACE gene polymorphism and progression of IgAN is only seen in \nAsian patients (15). There are also some data that the prognosis of IgAN is influenced by \npolymorphisms of other genes related to vascular response and atherosclerosis, including \nangiotensinogen AGT (16) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1 (17). A role for \natherosclerosis in the progression of IgAN is supported by the association of progression of IgAN \nwith metabolic factors involved in atherosclerosis, including obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and \nhyperuricemia (18,19). These observations gave the rationale of the study published in this issue of \nNDT by Yamamoto et al, reporting the results of a multicenter retrospective observational study in \nJapan (PREDICT-IgAN) which investigated associations between disease progression and 100 \natherosclerosis-related gene polymorphisms in 320 proteinuric patients with IgAN. The scale of this \nstudy deserves attention since the majority of previous reports in IgAN have tested only a few genes \nof potential interest. There was a substantial period of follow-up (8.3 \u00b1 4.2 years) during which \n25.9% reached the end point of a 50% increase in serum creatinine. Using the Cox proportional-\nhazards model, three polymorphisms - glycoprotein Ia GPIa C807T and G873A and intercellular \nadhesion molecule-1 ICAM-1 A1548G (K469E) - were identified as independent genetic predictors \nof disease progression, along with conventional clinical prognostic factors, such as eGFR, urinary \nprotein, and use of antihypertensives at diagnosis. ACE ID and DD had no predictive value in \nmultivariate analysis. Patients with the minor homozygotes GPIa C807T\/G873A and ICAM-1 \nA1548G had significantly higher IgAN progression rates than those with the major homozygotes, \nand the authors concluded that these gene polymorphisms are associated with IgAN progression in a \nrecessive model.  \nThese genes have some biological plausibility as candidates. Glycoprotein Ia (integrin \u03b12 \nchain) is a transmembrane protein that forms dimers exclusively with glycoprotein IIa (integrin \u03b21 \nchain), to form the glycoprotein Ia\/IIa, also known as \u03b12\u03b21 integrin. This integrin, a member of \nadhesion molecule family, is selectively expressed on the surface of platelets, and conditions \nplatelet adhesiveness to collagens. GPIa polymorphisms have been associated with cardiovascular \ndiseases (20). Glycoprotein IIa (\u03b21) is expressed in glomeruli in IgAN and in healthy subjects (1921). \nAlthough the authors speculate on a possible expression of \u03b12\u03b21 on mesangial cells influencing \nmesangial cell proliferation, this seems improbable. In mesangial cells \u03b21 colocalizes with \u03b13, \nforming an integrin specific for collagen IV (22), while \u03b12\u03b21 dimer is exclusively expressed on the \nsurface of platelets. Indeed \u03b13\u03b21 has been detected in cultured human mesangial cells, and another \nintegrin, \u03b1v\u03b23, is regulated by coincubation of mesangial cells with aberrantly glycosylated IgA \neither prepared in vitro or isolated from patients with IgAN (23). Rather, the Authors\u2019 findings \nfocus attention on the role of intracapillary factors governing the progression toward sclerosis of \nIgAN. The other gene polymorphism which the Authors report in association with IgAN \nprogression is ICAM-1, a cell surface glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily which \nmediates adhesion of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium. The ICAM-1 polymorphism \nassociated with disease progression in patients with IgAN (A1548G) regulates an increased \nexpression of ICAM-1 on the surface of endothelial cells, and leukocytes adhesion (24). This \npolymorphism is also associated with chronic inflammatory disorders in various organs, and \ncardiovascular disease (25). In patients with histopathologically advanced IgAN, glomerular and \ntubulointerstitial expression of ICAM-1 was particularly evident (26,27).  \nAs the Authors pointed out, functional genomic studies are needed to confirm any role for \nthese polymorphisms in progression of IgAN. However, as well as the interpretation provided by \nthe authors, that these polymorphisms might favour accelerated atherosclerosis which could \ncontribute to accelerated progression in IgAN, we see in this study an additional point of interest. In \nthe recently published Oxford Classification of IgAN, we identified endothelial hypercellularity as \nan independent risk factor for IgAN progression, even when clinical data at renal biopsy and at \nfollow-up were considered (28,29). An endocapillary inflammatory process might be regulated by  \npolymorphisms leading to altered ICAM1 expression which may favour an intracapillary \nhypercellular response to circulating macromolecular IgA reaching the glomerulus on the way to  \nmesangial deposition. \nWhile the approach taken in this study to investigate a substantial number of genes relating \nto a particular disease modifying pathway represents an advance on the many previous studies of \nvery small numbers of candidates, it still lacks some of the power needed to speed progress in our \ngenetic understanding of the heterogeneous complex trait disorder known as IgAN. Genome wide \nassociation studies represent a new avenue likely to provide major new information provided \ncohorts of sufficient size are available for analysis. A number of collaborative research groups \naround the world are establishing such cohorts in IgAN, and important new findings may soon \nemerge. \nREFERENCES \n1. Hsu SI, Ramirez SB, Winn MP, et al.
