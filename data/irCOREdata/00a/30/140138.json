On the one hand, his research suggests that the number \nof firms engaged in social reporting is increasing, as is the average length of their \nreports.  However, despite a widening recognition among business leaders of the \nneed to accept a broader responsibility than short-term profits, he concludes that \nthe quality of their CSR reporting has hardly improved in the last 5 years \n(Elkington, 2003).  At the same conference, Simon Zadek of Accountability \nargues that neither these CSR programmes nor their reporting procedures have \na significant impact on business decision making (Zadek, 2002). \n We report on a quantitative study of CSR reporting among a number of leading \nFTSE companies (the top 150 FTSE4GooDi companies) to explore the nature \nand scope of their CSR stakeholder relationships and reporting.  The study tests \nsix hypotheses based upon a framework for understanding CSR practices which \nwe developed through an exploratory study (Maklan and Knox, 2003). We \nconclude that only the biggest of these FTSE companies, particularly extraction \ncompanies and telecoms, can claim to identify, prioritise and communicate with \n 4\ntheir CSR stakeholders.  However, the majority are now reporting details of the \nsocial outcomes linked to their CSR programmes but the reporting of business \noutcomes is limited to the largest of FTSE companies.  \nWe then discuss the management issues which need to be resolved if the \ngeneral perception of CSR is to change from being regarded mainly as an \nexpensive exercise in compliance and reporting to an important contributor of \nsustainable business development.  Finally, we highlight the limitations of our \nstudy and make suggestions for future research.   \nIn the next section, we explore the growing impact of CSR on business as \nviewed by differing interest groups. \n \nThe Growing Impact of Corporate Responsibility on Businesses \nOver thirty years ago, Milton Friedman wrote in the New York Times that the \nsocial responsibility of a business was to increase its profits.  Any diversion of \ncompany resources to social programmes, charity and other non-profit \ngenerating activities, the Nobel Laureate argues, represents a tax on consumers \nand investors (Friedman, 1970).  Such a tax reduces society\u2019s total wealth and \nsatisfaction.  His position, based upon sound free-market ideology, has come \nunder increasing attack since time of writing and can no longer provide the \nbusiness leader with an erudite means of avoiding the issue.  Corporate Social \nResponsibility (CSR) is something that every Board must now address in some \nform.  Ironically, it is arguably the triumph of free-market ideology over regulated \n 5\neconomies which has foisted new responsibilities on increasingly powerful \nmultinationals companies.  Globalisation strategies provide businesses with \nunprecedented access to markets and ever-lower production costs (Day and \nMontgomery, 1999), it has also brought closer to reality the concept of the global \nvillage first discussed in the 1980s by Levitt (1983).  Business practices, even \nthose conducted a very long way from their home markets, can be subject to \nintense scrutiny and comment by customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders \nand governments, as well as other groups upon whose support the business \nrelies (Googins and Rochin, 2000). One such group, Non-Governmental \nOrganisations (NGOs), have become more and more powerful in recent years, \ncalling business to account for policies in the areas of fair trade, human rights, \nworkers\u2019 rights, environmental impact, financial probity and corporate \ngovernance.  In an ever more cynical world, where society is much less inclined \nto trust their governments and businesses, NGOs retain high levels of trust \nacross a broad spectrum of society. \n \nWhilst it is true that in certain circumstances powerful multinational companies \ncan impose trading conditions on the less powerful, such as non-unionised \nworkers, commodity producers in developing countries and third world labourers \n(Klein, 1999), the idea that modern companies must commit themselves to \neffectively address poverty and environmental degradation must surely be an \noverstatement.  This discussion between advocates of Milton Friedman\u2019s position \n\u2013 limiting responsibility to maximising profit \u2013 and NGO activists who regard firms \n 6\nbeing primarily instruments of social policy represents the extreme ends of the \ndebate. Many academics writing in the field of CSR are cognisant of these \nextremes and seek to establish a middle ground: \n \nWood (1991) suggests that the public responsibility of business is divided into \nareas of social involvement directly related to their business activities and \ncompetencies, with secondary areas of involvement relating to its primary \nactivities.  For example, an auto maker might reasonably be expected to deal \nwith vehicle safety and the environment but not low-income housing or adult \nilliteracy.  Clarkson\u2019s long-term study of corporate behaviour (Clarkson, 1995) \nindicates that companies deal with stakeholders, not society, and that CSR must \ndistinguish between stakeholder needs and social issues; managers can address \nstakeholder requirements but not abstract social policy.  Carroll (1979, 1991) \nsuggests corporate responsibility has different layers:  economic, legal, ethical \nand discretionary categories of business performance and those business \nleaders must decide the layer at which they choose to operate. \n \nSimilarly, the UK Government wishes to establish a middle ground in this debate, \nwith the Prime Minister suggesting that, \u201cwe must ensure that economic growth \ncontributes to our quality of life, rather than degrading it.  And we can all share \nthe benefits\u201d. (DTI, 2001). \n 7\nFinally, although business leaders themselves acknowledge that their firms are \nsocially created and \u2018licensed\u2019, most would argue they were created primarily as \neconomic agents to provide the goods and services society wants at the right \nprice, quality and availability.  As such, their firms\u2019 competencies are built around \ntheir commercial activities and they have very limited expertise addressing \ncomplex social and economic problems.  As an example to illustrate this point, \nwe argue that while one thousand software firms tackling global poverty through \na myriad of small initiatives is laudable, it is likely to be ineffective.  Arguably, it \nwould be more effective \u2013 and efficient \u2013 for governments to tax these firms and \ngive the money to multinational agencies that are competent in the field. \nIn establishing the scope of our research, we sought to identify received wisdom \nabout CSR activities in general, and the impact of these activities across \nstakeholders regarding business and social outcomes in particular.  In both \ncases, we find the arguments presented and claims made about the positive \nimpact of CSR on the business and key stakeholders to be highly assumptive \nand lacking in empiricism.  These assumptions are presented next and our \nquestioning of these beliefs forms the background to our research objectives. \n \nAssertions and Beliefs about the Impact of CSR Programmes \nIn reviewing the arguments that \u2018you do well by doing good\u2019, we can readily \nidentify five commonly-held beliefs which seem to be largely anecdotal and, as \nsuch, highly questionable: \n 8\n\u2022 Consumer preferences will increasingly favour products and services from \nsocially responsible, transparent and trustworthy firms (Wilmott, 2001 and \nMitchell, 2001). \n\u2212 The assertion that consumer behaviour will shift to reward social \nresponsibility is grounded in surveys of attitudes and trade-off analysis, \nnot observed behaviour.  Attitude-behaviour correspondence seems to \nlack empirical grounding and is not obviously evident when researched \n(Knox and Walker, 2001, 2003). \n\u2022 Investors will increasingly favour responsible companies and irresponsible \ncompanies will find their cost of borrowing rises (Accountability, 2002). \n\u2212 Zadek (2002) acknowledges that only 4% of the total funds available for \nstock market investment are governed by CSR principles, therefore, most \nfirms judged not to be socially responsible still have full access to equity \nfunding. However, more recent data suggests that the much-anticipated \ninvestor demands for responsibility are increasing in \u201cCSR-aware\u201d \nenvironments such as Western Europe and Canada (Bartolomeo and \nFamillari, 2004; SIO, 2005).  In Europe SRI funds grew in excess of 50% \nin 2004. \n\u2022 Potential employees will be attracted only to responsible companies and \nothers risk skill shortages (Department of Trade and Industry, 2001: Citing the \n1998 McKinsey Study, \u201cThe War for Talent\u201d and MORI research). \n 9\n\u2212 Arguments about competing for talent also appear to be based upon \nstated intention and not observed behaviour.  Cited studies were \nconcluded during the last long period of uninterrupted economic growth \nand may be cyclical.  This link between employee motivations, customer \nretention and shareholder value has been made separately from CSR \ntheory (Reichheld, 1996). \n\u2022 Engaging with stakeholders encourages innovation.  DTI case studies (2001, \n2002) and Kong et al (2002) cite examples of cost savings and revenue \ngrowth through fairer supplier policies. \n\u2212 Von Hippel (1986, 1989, Thomke and Von Hippel, 2002) has been \npresenting these arguments and case- studies for over 20 years without \nreference to CSR practices. \n\u2022 Being trusted by stakeholders and pursuing socially responsible policies \nreduces risks arising from safety issues (consumer, employee and \ncommunity), potential boycotts and loss of corporate reputation. \n\u2212 Clearly, concern for safety and building trust is paramount to the firm\u2019s \nreputation management and future sales but cannot be exclusively \nassociated with CSR policies.  In fact, it\u2019s just good business practice to \npursue both with vigour. \n \nIn essence, while the above arguments for CSR are intuitively appealing, many \nresearchers admit the links between developing a sustainable business strategy \n 10\nand the implementation of CSR programmes are difficult, if not impossible, to \nprove (Wood and Jones, 1995).  It is against this background we have set our \nresearch objectives, hypotheses and protocol that we discussed next. \n \nResearch Objectives, Hypotheses and Protocol \nOur research aim is to contribute to the development of descriptive CSR theory \n(Donaldson and Preston 1995) by providing a greater understanding of how \nleading FTSE companies, who have been identified as having well-developed \nCSR reporting practicesi, choose to engage with stakeholders: the nature of their \nCSR programmes and what they communicate to them through their CSR \nreports.  So far as we are aware, there is little prior theory or an appropriate \nframework in the literature for us to draw upon in developing our research \nobjectives and hypotheses.  Consequently, to provide this framework for the \nquantitative study reported here, we first carried out an exploratory study across \nsix multinational companies.  Through semi-structured interviews with the CSR \nleaders of these six firms, a framework has been generated from a prototype \nbased on the literature (Maklan and Knox, 2003).  This exploratory study was \ngrounded in the literature that links CSR investment to business outcomes and \ndraws variously upon Financial Theory, Corporate Reputation, Brand Marketing, \nCustomer Relationship Management and Strategy. In the study, we asked \nrespondents to verify the extent to which their companies are able to validate the \ncausal pathways implied from these literatures. For example, the extent to which \n 11\ntheir CSR programmes reduces borrowing costs, improves employee recruitment \nor customer loyalty. Respondents were also asked to draw their perceptions of \nthe casual map linking their CSR programmes with business and social \noutcomes. The data from these interviews was synthesised to produce Figure 1:  \n \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n   \nFigure 1 illustrates the key findings from our exploratory research. Each company \nin our study had intuitive reasons for developing CSR programmes based upon \nits vision and values. Respondents presented arguments for investing in CSR \nbased on factors such as fit with their brand values, relevance to customers and \nattractiveness to their employees. They all believed that CSR investments would \nenhance their corporate or brand reputation and motivate employees; the latter \nwas of particular interest to service-based companies. As CSR values and \npolices became embedded in the organisation, respondents anticipated that \nemployee behaviours and decision-making would change in consideration of the \nneeds of key stakeholders.  By listening and responding to a broader influencing \naudience and by fostering the firm\u2019s reputation, there was a belief that the \nattitudes and subsequent behaviours of such stakeholders towards the firm and \nits commercial offers could be influenced.  Ultimately, respondents believed that \nthis would lead to increased turnover, reduced cost and more sustainable \nperformance (less volatility of cash flow).  \n 12\n Most of the companies interviewed had ongoing measurement systems of \nemployee attitudes and corporate reputation but could not isolate the impact of \nCSR programmes from all other influences or provide empirical data to link them \nwith stakeholder behaviour and business outcomes. In other words, figure 1 \nrepresents a managerial construction of the intuitive logic behind developing \nCSR practices and it is this framework that is used to develop and test the six \nhypotheses stemming from our research objectives:   \n\u2022 To explore the nature and scope of stakeholder relationships among \nleading FTSE companies based upon their CSR reporting. \n\u2022 To identify the extent their CSR programmes and reporting impact on \nsocial and business outcomes. \n\u2022 To compare and contrast these findings according to market capitalisation \nand industry sector. \n \nDeveloping the Research Hypotheses  \n \nThe three main aspects of the CSR Framework (figure 1) we are exploring in this \nstudy are stakeholder relationships, social outcomes and business outcomes.  \nAgainst each, we also highlight the research hypotheses being tested and \nprovide an explanation of their derivation from the CSR literature:  \nCSR Stakeholder Relationships \nHypothesis 1 (H1): Companies clearly identify key stakeholders \n 13\nStakeholders are defined as: \u201canyone who is directly or indirectly involved with \nthe corporation: employees, citizens, shareholders, NGOs, unions and \ngovernment agencies, in short: the social and physical environment\u201d (Clarkson, \n1995).  Clarkson also notes that a multi-stakeholder dialogue is not a \nstraightforward and simple activity. Since the early 1980s, the concepts of \nstakeholder and multi-stakeholder dialogue play a central role in discussions on \nCSR. Clarkson (1995), over viewing his data from more than fifty case studies, \nconcludes that corporate social responsibilities, responsiveness, and \nperformances are best understood by analysing and evaluating the way in which \ncorporations actually manage their relationships with employees, customers, \nshareholders, suppliers, governments, and the communities in which they \noperate. The first proposition is designed to test whether companies perform as \nClarkson recommends by identifying their key stakeholders identified in figure 1.  \nHypothesis 2 (H2): Companies do not systematically prioritise stakeholders \nThis hypothesis was drawn from our 2003 empirical study of CSR practices \nwhich found that companies are clear about their most important stakeholder but \ndo not seem to set priorities among secondary stakeholders.  \nThus, this hypothesis is designed to test whether leading FTSE companies \nestablish priorities between their stakeholders. \nHypothesis 3 (H3): CSR investment are communicated effectively to stake- \nholders \n 14\nFigure 1 suggests that companies can communicate their CSR policies to \nstakeholders in a manner that affects stakeholders\u2019 attitudes and subsequently \ntheir behaviours.  Maignon and Ferrell (2003) challenge this assertion and call for \nresearch which scrutinizes the communication strategies, media, and appeals \nmost appropriate to engender awareness of CSR practices and to stimulate \nstakeholder identification.  This hypothesis will determine whether or not \ncompanies are able to effectively communicate their CSR investment through \ntheir annual reports. \nHypothesis 4 (H4): Companies are not currently developing relationships with a \nlarge range of stakeholders \nHypothesis 4 is the final aspect of stakeholder relationships to be tested here and \nis derived from our original study (Maklan and Knox, 2003) and Windsor\u2019s work \n(2001) which explores whether or not companies are starting to develop \nrelationships across a broad range of their stakeholders. Windsor examines \nBowen\u2019s (1953) key question of whether the interests of business and society \nmerge in the long run and provides a developmental history of corporate social \nresponsibility from the progressive era forward to Carroll\u2019s (1991) pyramid of \ncorporate social responsibilities.  The paper also offers caveats concerning the \nfuture directions and prospects for corporate social responsibility theory and \npractice. Windsor highlights the need for managers to understand that there are \nserious deviations between short run impacts of business activities and the long \nrun alignment of business and social interests in wealth creation. To counter this, \n 15\nhe suggests that companies should focus more on building broader relationships \nwith their stakeholders. \n \nCSR Social and Business Outcomes \nHypothesis 5 (H5): Social outcomes linked to CSR investment are difficult to \nidentify \nOnly one of the six companies participating in the authors\u2019 qualitative study \n(2003) systematically assesses the social benefit of its CSR investment. \nSchwartz and Carroll (2003), extrapolating from Carroll\u2019s work (1979, 1991), \nstress that it is difficult for companies to ascertain identifiable social outcomes \nfrom their CSR investment. Yet if companies do not measure social benefit, how \nare they to assess the effectiveness of their CSR programmes? \nThis hypothesis aims to discover whether companies are able to identify any \nsocial outcomes and other wider benefits from their CSR programme. \nHypothesis 6 (H6): CSR is not currently linked with specific business outcomes \nCompanies find it difficult to isolate the impact of CSR investments from all other \nbusiness activities when assessing stakeholder behaviour and business \noutcomes (Maklan and Knox, 2003).  We report that companies monitor \nstakeholder attitudes regularly and systematically but find it much harder to move \nto the \u2018right hand side\u2019 of figure 1 and link changes in stakeholders\u2019 attitudes to \nbehaviours, and, subsequently, to business outcomes.  It is intuitively appealing \nto suggest that if this hypothesis is true, it will be hard to sustain business interest \n 16\nand investment in CSR over the long term. The relationship between altruism \nand corporate self-interest is complex and, perhaps, one of the most difficult \nareas for managers to see any demonstrable business return from their CSR \ninvestment (Wood and Jones, 1995).  However, we will seek evidence to support \nor refute this proposition. \n \nThe Research Protocol \nThe sample frame consists of the top 150 companies on the FTSE4GooD Global \nIndex System1 [a division of FTSE International Ltd., FTSE (2004)] which are \nconsidered to provide the most comprehensive CSR reporting of all the national \nand international companies listed on the London stock exchange (see Appendix \n1 for the list). Although McCutcheon and Meredith (1993) argue that company \nreports tend to lack rigour and objectivity, Remenyi et al. (2000) argue that all \nresearch tactics may include biases, including experiments and surveys.  While \nacknowledging the limitations of our purposeful sample (Eisenhardt 1989), we \nsuggest that this data set can still offer insights on how the most committed \ncompanies in Europe perform against our research hypotheses.   \n \nThe research instrument used is a self-administered questionnaire in which each \nof the six hypotheses is calibrated on a 5-point scale according to criteria \nidentifiable from the literature and our exploratory research (see appendix 2 for \nthe questionnaire).  The questionnaire was pre-tested twice by three independent \n 17\nexperts to ensure two things.  First, to check that the wording and general layout \nwas clear and, second, to test that the interrogation of the firm\u2019s online CSR \nreport (a section of their annual report for 2003) led to the same categorisation of \neach of the six hypotheses, firm by firm.  Initially, a convergence of 60% was \nachieved on this categorisation, then 75% with the rewording of three of the \nhypotheses and, finally, a convergence of >90% was achieved across the ten \nsample firms drawn randomly from the list and tested independently by the \nexperts and ourselves.  The survey was then carried over a two week period \nusing the latest available, online company report (usually for the financial year \nending 2003) and, not unexpectedly, 100% of the sample mentioned their CSR \nactivities in varying degrees so they have all been included in our analysis. \nAn initial analysis of all 150 companies failed to provide meaningful insights into \nthe CSR practices of these companies, so we divide the companies into three \ngroups of fifty according to market capitalisationii (Large, Medium and Small) \nwhich provides the basis for reporting in this paper and is in accord with \nWaddock and Graves\u2019 (1997) research which concludes that company size does \nimpact on CSR practices.  This level of disaggregation provides far greater \ninsight into CSR practices.  We also explore performance by industry sectoriii to \namplify our results and to provide illustrative examples (each company is \ncategorised into one of ten industry sectors, such as extraction companies and \nbanking, as appendix 1 shows). The authors acknowledge that many of the \nindustry sector cell sizes are small and discuss this further in our limitations \nsection later. \n 18\nAggregate data analysis was carried out using SPSS and one-way analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA) was used to test for significant differences across the three \ngroupings by market capitalisation (Large: \u00a310.8bn - \u00a33.82bn; Medium: \u00a33.81bn - \n\u00a31.28bn; Small: \u00a31.27bn - \u00a30.52bn).  A Levenve test confirmed that there was no \nreason to reject the assumption of homogeneity of variance (p<0.308).  Post hoc \ntesting, using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) Method, was then applied to \ntest significances between specific groups.  We also carried out similar post hoc \ntests to the data set by industry sector to highlight differences in certain markets. \nThe significance level was set at 95% and all tests were two-tailed.   Both sets of \nresults are displayed below against each of the six hypotheses in the results and \nconclusion section. \n \nResults and Conclusions \nThe results of our analysis are set out so that each of the four stakeholder \nproposition is briefly discussed before drawing together the main conclusions \nabout stakeholder relationships.  This is then followed by a discussion of the \nreporting of social and business outcomes linked to CSR programmes. \n \nCSR Stakeholder Relationships \nH1: Companies clearly identify key stakeholders: \nTable 1.1 \nTable 1.2 \n 19\n \nAlthough we identify ten key stakeholders in our framework and from the \nliterature, the sample mean of 3.29 suggests that these companies identify \nbetween three and seven stakeholders in their CSR reporting [a score of one \nmeans that a company has not identified any stakeholders whilst five means that \nit has identified all types of stakeholders as defined by Clarkson (1995).  The full \ndetails of all the scales are explained in Appendix 2].  \u2018Large\u2019 companies identify \nthe greatest number of stakeholders while \u2018Small\u2019 firms report on less than three.  \nAn example of such a company is iSoft, an IT company, which only identifies two \nstakeholders. Not surprising, oil and gas exploration companies (table 1.2: \nindustry sector 00) perform significantly better than all other sector when it comes \nto identifying relevant stakeholders.   For example, BP identifies eight \nstakeholders in their annual CSR report. Arguably, this is because there is great \npressure on such companies to meet stakeholder expectations in order to \nmaintain their license to operate.  With the exception of extraction companies \n(industry sector 00) and telecoms (60), the remaining FTSE4GooD companies \nidentify only a narrow range of stakeholders and H1 is refuted.   \n \nH2: Companies do not systematically prioritise stakeholders: \nTable 2.1 \nTable 2.2 \nWith the exception of a few large pharmaceutical companies, such as \nGlaxoSmithKleine (no. 4 by size), and the extraction companies, none of our \n 20\nsample seems to systematically prioritise their stakeholders (a low score means \nthat companies do not set priorities between stakeholders and hence a low score \nsupports H2). \nAlthough all recognise and mention customers as a primary group, even among \nthe narrow range of stakeholders they do identify, evidence of the firm\u2019s priority \nstakeholders is not provided by their reports.  This was the conclusion we also \ndrew from our previous study and H2 is accepted.   \n \nH3: CSR investment can be communicated effectively to stakeholders: \nTable 3.1 \nTable 3.2 \nIt is interesting that most firms generally refer to one of their CSR investments \nand give some details of their purpose and commitments, albeit usually in a \ndescriptive way.  Again, \u2018Large\u2019 companies are significantly more adept at \ncommunicating their investments than the smaller third of companies (a low \nscore means that companies are not communicating effectively and a high score \ndemonstrates that a company regular communicates with a large range of \nstakeholders).  For instance, within the financial sector (8), Barclays Bank (no. 8 \nby size) highlights the amounts and areas where CSR investments have \noccurred while Great Portland Estates, no. 146 by size and in the same industry \nsector, makes no mention. Again, extraction companies (00), and telecoms (60) \nare more effective at communicating their investment activities than any of the \n 21\nother companies by sector (see table 3.2).  \n \nWhile recognising the delicate balance of what is said and how it is said without \nbeing seen to be exploiting CSR purely for publicity purposes, nonetheless, these \npublic companies are spending shareholder money and are accountable for their \ndiscretionary CSR investments.  H3 is refuted.     \n \nH4: Companies are not currently developing relationships with a large range of \nstakeholders: \nTable 4.1 \nTable 4.2 \nThe data suggests that the majority of companies find it difficult to build \nrelationships with more than one or two stakeholders as the mean score is 2.37 \n(a company scores one when it does not describe a relationship with any \nstakeholders and five where it provides detailed evidence of relationships with \nnumerous stakeholders).  \nBoth \u2018Small\u2019 and \u2018Medium\u2019 seem to focus on only one \u2013 usually customers \u2013 \nwhich seems extraordinary to us, given the claimed benefits of working with a \nbroad range of stakeholders through CSR activities discussed in an earlier \nsection.  Again, \u2018Large\u2019 companies and extraction companies in particular, \nperform significantly better than all other others in the sample (see table 4.2).  In \n 22\nfact, all the extraction companies claim a broad range of relationships with \nstakeholders and are actively communicating how they are investing in these \nrelationships. The response to H4 is consistent with the low level of CSR \ncommunications to stakeholders (H3) and how they prioritise them (H2), so H4 is \naccepted.  \n \nTo conclude this section on stakeholder relationships, there is a consistency in \nour findings across all four hypotheses. With the exception of extraction \ncompanies and telecoms, leading FTSE companies selected for their capabilities \nin CSR reporting seem neither to publicly identify their key stakeholders nor to \nprioritise them.  Most seem satisfied to acknowledge the primacy of their \ncustomers in their reporting.  Indeed, our data also suggests that most seem \nreluctant to build stakeholder relationships through their CSR programmes, other \nthan the extraction companies who do seem to communicate their stakeholder \nrelationships effectively. \n \nAll the evidence drawn from our analysis of these one hundred and fifty CSR \nreports suggests that it is really only the twenty or so companies involved in \nextraction, telecoms, and to a more limited extent the utilities, which recognise \nthe need to manage stakeholder relationships through their CSR programmes \nand to communicate their activities effectively.  However, for the remaining one \nhundred and thirty companies, other than the largest pharmaceutical companies \nwhere global expectations of their CSR activities are also sensitive, stakeholder \n 23\nmanagement seems not to have developed or should be considered embryonic \nat best.    \nCSR Social and Business Outcomes \nH5: Social outcomes linked to CSR investment are difficult to identify: \nTable 5.1 \nTable 5.2 \n \nThe reporting of social outcomes seems clearly linked to the size of the \ncompany, with both \u2018Large\u2019 and \u2018Medium\u2019 showing significantly differences in \nreporting to \u2018Small\u2019 companies who, generally, report on one CSR activity with a \nsocial outcome with a mean score of 2.52 (a company scores one when there is \nno reported link of CSR to social outcomes and five where there is strong \nreported evidence of such a link such as reported data and or case studies).  The \nlarger companies, presumably because they have more dedicated resources, \nengage and report on several such CSR projects.  Again, the extraction \ncompanies stand alone in demonstrating their capabilities in connecting the \nsocial outcomes of their main CSR work against financial inputs and often use \ncase studies to communicate the scope of these projects. They do, of course, \nreport extensively on their emissions and pollution reduction achievements in \nresponse to environmental legislation and, perhaps, because it is more readily \nmeasured than other community programmes.  Contrary to our expectations from \nthe exploratory study and the literature, H5 is rejected. \n 24\nH6: CSR is not currently linked with specific business outcomes: \nTable 6.1 \nTable 6.2 \nAgain, there is an evident size effect across the sample, with some \u2018Large\u2019 \ncompanies identifying their CSR investments with several business outcomes, \nsuch as share price, profit, and customer acquisition, with a mean score of 3.26 \n(see table 6.1).  In contrast, most \u2018Medium\u2019 and \u2018Small\u2019 companies tend not to link \ntheir programmes with business goals in their formal reporting.  Of the six \nhypotheses tested, H6 scores lowest on the 5-point scale with a mean of 2.36 \nand is rejected. \nTo draw together our main findings on CSR reporting for these leading \ncompanies in the FTSE, it would appear that \u2018Large\u2019 firms focus on developing \ntheir CSR activities and capabilities that link outcomes with inputs through the \nmechanisms illustrated in figure 1. However, the scores across the six \nhypotheses are not high and are much lower for \u2018Medium\u2019 and \u2018Small\u2019 firms. This \nstudy supports the authors\u2019 earlier conclusion from their previous exploratory \nresearch: \n Most companies are not systematic and rigorous in moving through figure 1 from \nleft to right.  In particular, \u2018Medium\u2019 and \u2018Small\u2019 firms in the FTSE do not: \n (H1) identify large numbers of stakeholders (they focus on customers almost \nexclusively); nor \n (H2) set priorities between them; neither do they \n 25\n (H3) communicate the impact of their CSR investments; nor \n (H4) develop strong relationships across a range of CSR stakeholders.  \nHence, it is understandable that only a few FTSE firms can identify the impact of \nCSR upon business performance (H6), despite some evidence of measured \nsocial outcomes (H5). \n \nIt could be that some of these stakeholder relationships are being forged \nelsewhere in the business for more commercial reasons; however, for companies \nto simply focus on customers as their key stakeholder of CSR and to allow key \nstakeholder relationships to develop solely as a by-product of commercial \nconsiderations, seems to us a limited ambition. Recent research by Holt, Quelch \nand Taylor (2004) on global brands and their consumer appeal, does indicate \nthat over fifty percent of respondents in twelve countries express the view that \nsuch companies must behave responsibly on such issues as consumer health, \nthe environment and worker\u2019s rights. So from a purely marketing perspective, \neffective CSR reporting to customers is an important first step.  However, \nemployee engagement seems to us a critical further step in achieving \ncommitment to programmes that have a broader company and stakeholder \nappeal.  Our analysis of CSR indicates it\u2019s rare to find a FTSE company that is \nmobilising its employees to this end.  \n     \nImplications for Theory \n 26\nOne conclusion drawn from our research is that firms tend to focus on the \u201cends\u201d \nof Figure 1, that is, they develop a clear vision for their CSR programmes and, to \na lesser extent, they attempt to assess the business and social outcomes \nassociated with these investments. However, they fail to develop a coherent \napproach for understanding how those investments impact reputation and \nemployees and, subsequently, stakeholders in creating these outcomes. There is \nalso strong evidence that the largest companies, particularly those in the \nextraction and telecoms industries, are more sophisticated in their approach to \nCSR than other firms and have developed more of that understanding of how \nCSR works through stakeholders to produce outcomes.  \n \nTheory provides a number of possible mechanisms by which CSR can impact \nbusiness outcomes. Jones (1995) offers Agency Theory and Transaction Cost to \nexplain that responsible firms will be more trusted (reputation in Figure 1) and \nhence will have lower transaction costs. Frooman (1999) outlines Resource \nDependency arguments to illustrate how irresponsible firms might find critical \nresources denied to them and Mitchell et al (1997) suggest how companies can \nmanage competing stakeholder demands in the context of Resource \nDependency.  Maignan and Ferrell (2001) argue that CSR can be an element of \nthe marketing strategy that enhances revenue.  \n \nOur research suggests that most companies do not seem to have a \u201clocal theory\u201d \nfor linking their CSR inputs to business outcomes because they do not actively \n 27\nmanage a sufficiently large number of stakeholders or set priorities between \nthem.  Only the largest firms communicate their CSR policies effectively.  It is \ndifficult, therefore, for researchers to ascribe any of the above theories against \ncurrent practices.  Clarkson (1995) infers that companies attempt to manage \nstakeholders rather than society in general but that they don\u2019t manage these \nrelationships with any degree of sophistication. The very largest companies, \nparticularly extraction companies, seem to be the exception and one can only \nspeculate that is either because they are at the vanguard of CSR management \npractice or that they face immediate and business-critical consequences from \nincreasing stakeholder activism.  \n     \nManagerial Implications \nManagers need to be more thorough and systematic in their CSR practices. \nWhile the largest of the CSR-aware firms in this study try to link CSR with \nbusiness and social outcomes, only the most sophisticated CSR practitioners \nmanage to do so. These firms are amongst the largest FTSE4GooD companies \nand are concentrated in industries that are subject to intense social scrutiny, \nsuch as extraction and telecommunications.  For these firms, figure 1 is a \nreasonable illustration of their CSR practices. \n \nWe can speculate whether or not the best CSR practices will spread wider than \nthis select group. One could argue that the results suggest that CSR is practiced \n 28\nsystematically and rigorously either by companies facing big social pressure and \nor who are big enough to be able to \u2018afford\u2019 it. Alternately, one could speculate \nthat CSR practices and measurement will develop first with these firms then \ndiffuse much more widely as society demands greater transparency and \nresponsibility from companies.  \n \nFirms need to identify a limited set of stakeholders with whom they can develop \nstrong relationships. Priorities need to be established between these \nstakeholders for firms to be able to engage with them and to manage the trade-\noffs between them in the event of conflicting demands; it is unreasonable to \nexpect companies to engage with vague notions of society \u2013 they need to \nengage with specific interest groups (Clarkson 1995).  Following this approach to \nimproved stakeholder management, companies then need to communicate \nsalient information to relevant stakeholders, particularly employees, so CSR \ninvestments can influence their attitudes and behaviours. As this process \nbecomes better managed and more transparent, it will be easier for firms to \nunderstand and measure the impact of CSR upon business outcomes. \n \nSince governments are concerned that the benefits of CSR practice are shared \nwith small- and medium-sized enterprises, the results of this study should \nconcern policy makers. Currently, good practice is enjoyed by a very select group \n\u2013 the largest firms of FTSE companies who are most socially aware. If size \ndiscriminates between sophisticated and embryonic CSR practice, then one \n 29\nmight conclude that the CSR practices of small and medium-sized enterprises, \nwhich represent the vast majority of firms, are likely to be weak.  \n \nLimitations and Further Research  \nIn our exploratory study (Maklan and Knox 2003), each of the CSR leaders were \nasked about how we could extend our work through a quantitative study, which \ncentred on the CSR framework they had helped us develop.  When a mail or e-\nmail survey across a broader sample of their peers was suggested, there was a \nnegative response and two main reasons were given.   First, they are currently \nbombarded with questionnaires from NGOs demanding specific information \nabout their company\u2019s CSR policies and practices.  Consequently, they felt that \nthe response levels to our questionnaire would be very low indeed, given that \nmost CSR leaders of multinational companies are in the same position.  Second, \nthey also considered it unlikely that many, if any, CSR spokespeople would \nreveal information about their company\u2019s CSR programme which wasn\u2019t in the \npublic domain.  So to develop our exploratory study beyond semi-structured \ninterviews, we rejected a mail survey approach in favour of interrogating the \npublished reports of leading FTSE companies who meet globally recognized \nCSR standards.  The FTSE4GooD index was recognised by all our respondents \nas the most thoroughly researched index of choice.  Notwithstanding our earlier \nreflections on the likelihood of bias in company reports (McCutcheon and \nMeredith 1993), given the paucity of information available in the public domain \nand the resistance we were likely to encounter from the companies themselves, \n 30\nwe felt that a quantitative analysis of their CSR reports could be justified.   \nA second limitation we recognise is the broad categorisation of some of the \nscales in the questionnaire we designed. In developing and piloting the \nquestionnaire, we had to balance two things.  On the one hand, we had to ensure \nthat the scales were inclusive while on the other hand, we were also seeking to \nachieve distributions around the mean that would enable us to carry out post hoc \ntesting on the data set. Our results suggest that we have been able to achieve \nthis balance since there seems to be a degree of consistency in the ANOVA \nresults across the sample.  However, we offer our questionnaire (appendix 2) for \nother researchers to develop and modify should they wish to extend our study.    \nFinally, the sub-cells for many industry sectors are very small, certainly well \nbelow 30 that is a widely accepted mark for making statistically significant \ncomparisons between sub-cells.  This is unavoidable as there is a limited number \nof FTSE listed firms in many industry sectors, let alone the FTSE4GooD series \nand there are only a few major extraction companies, banks and telecom service \nproviders.  \nIn future research, one might consider extending the sample frame internationally \nto overcome this limitation.  For instance, it would be interesting to do a \ncomparative analysis between the UK index and the US FTSE4GooD companies \nby size and by industry sectors.  However, given that responsibility-driven \nindexes, such as the FTSE4GooD, are currently nationally based (a reflection of \nthe national nature of most stock markets), any such extension would be \nchallenging to normalise.  To develop descriptive CSR theory further, it seems to \n 31\nus that researching and writing new case studies, drawn from among the best-\nperforming FTSE4GooD companies reported here, would build upon Clarkson\u2019s \n(1995) work and help foster better managerial practices as the demand for \ntransparency in social and environmental reporting becomes more pressing. \n \nAcknowledgement \nOur thanks to Edelman (London) for sponsoring our pilot research and for \nfacilitating some client contacts and to John Towriss in the School for keeping \nour analysis very simple. \nReferences \nAccountability 2002, Accountability Primer: Socially responsible investment. \nhttp:\/\/www.accountability.org.uk\/uploadstore\/cms\/docs\/SociallyResponsibleInvest\nment.pdf. \n. \nBartolomeo, M. and Famillari, G.,2004, Avanzi SRI Research, \u2018Green, Social \nand Ethical Funds in Europe\u2019, October.  \nhttp:\/\/www.avanzi-sri.org\/pdf\/Complete_report_2004_final.pdf \n \nBowen, H.R., 1953, Social Responsibilities of the Business Man (Harper & Row, \nNew York). \nCarroll, A.
