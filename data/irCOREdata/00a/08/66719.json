Previous studies on the planar endwall\nhave shown significant areas of transitional flow, so the surface flow has been studied with\nthe aid of surface-mounted hot films. It was concluded that the loss reductions were not due\nto changes in regions of laminar and turbulent flow.\nKeywords: turbine blades, secondary flow, endwall profiling, experiment, CFD\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThree-dimensional non-axisymmetric endwall pro-\nfiling has been shown to reduce secondary loss\nusing a number of different geometries. Sieverding\n[1] provided an excellent review of secondary flows,\nthe fundamentals of which are not discussed in this\npaper. Harvey et al. [2] and Hartland et al. [3]\ndescribed the design and testing of a profiled end\nwall geometry for a low-speed linear cascade (the\nso-called Durham cascade); they showed a reduction\nin overall loss of some 20 per cent of the planar value.\nYan et al. [4] showed a reduction of 4 per cent in\noverall loss for a steam turbine nozzle geometry in\na linear cascade. Brennan et al. [5] and Rose et al.\n[6] designed and tested three-dimensional non-\naxisymmetric endwalls for the HP turbine of the\nRolls-Royce Trent 500 in an engine representative\nrig. They reported a stage efficiency improvement\nof 0.59 per cent. More recently, Harvey et al. [7] vali-\ndated endwall profiling in a multiple blade row\nenvironment and Ingram et al. [8] examined the\nreasons behind the improvement in performance.\nPut simply, non-axisymmetric endwall profiling\nworks by reducing the cross passage pressure gradient\nat the endwall by means of streamline curvature.\nThis reduced pressure gradient then results in less\nsecondary flow and therefore loss. In reality the\npicture is complicated by the fact there are multiple\nvortical structures in even cascade secondary flow [1]\nand the flow is transitional [9] but the reduced cross\npassage pressure gradient is the design aim. See\nIngram et al. [8] for more details on how endwall pro-\nfiling affects the flow structure.\nThis paper attempts to quantify the benefits of\nnon-axisymmetric endwalls when applied to a\nturbine cascade and examine how well the compu-\ntational fluid dynamics (CFD) solution used in the\ndesign of the profiles has predicted the actual flow.\nProviding an accurate and repeatable quantitative\nmeasurement of endwall performance is difficult\nand this paper describes methodologies developed\nat Durham to do just that.\nPrevious studies on the planar endwall [9] have\nshown significant areas of transitional flow, so the\nsurface flow has been studied with the aid of sur-\nface mounted hot films. If the loss reductions associ-\nated with endwall profiling are due to changing the\nnature of the blade surface boundary layer, the\nperformance gains may not be transferable to all\nmachines. If on the other hand the loss reductions\nassociated with endwall profiling are due to reduced\n49\nA06504 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\npassage vortex strength then the benefits of endwall\nprofiling will be more generally applicable.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\nThe Durham cascade is a low-speed, large-scale\nlinear cascade of six rotor blades taken from a high-\npressure rotor design. The cascade is shown in\nFig. 1. A grid of bars mounted 1400 mm in front of\nthe blades gives a turbulence intensity of around 5\nper cent at the inlet. A boundary layer bleed is pro-\nvided before the cascade is reached. The design\ndata for the cascade are given in Table 1. The aerofoil\nhas an aspect ratio of 1.78, which means there is a\nlarge region of undisturbed mid-span flow. Therefore\nthe secondary flow regions on each endwall of the\ncascade do not interfere with each other. The\nblades are cantilevered from one endwall, into\nwhich slots are cut to provide access for measure-\nment probes. Only one passage is instrumented.\nThe other endwall consists of a series of panels,\neach of which cover a blade passage. These panels\ncan be either profiled or flat. Measurements are\ntaken in half the blade passage.\nThe rig is set to operate as close as possible to the\ncorrect Reynolds number; the speed of the airflow\nthrough the tunnel is adjusted to compensate for\nvariations in atmospheric conditions. All the press-\nure probe readings are compensated to standard\nday conditions, so that readings from different days\ncan be compared with one another.\nTwo generations of endwall design are described\nin this paper, P1 (first-generation), with profiling\nextending throughout the computational domain,\nand P2, with profiling restricted to just the blade\npassage. The planar endwall is termed P0. Endwall\ngeometries are shown in Fig. 2. The contours rep-\nresent height deviations from the planar case\nand are in mm. As well as the \u2018hump and dip\u2019 com-\nbination necessary to reduce the cross passage\npressure gradient, the P1 geometry features an\nadditional ridge on the suction side of the passage\nnear the trailing edge. This was designed to reduce\nthe overturning at the wall by introducing an enhan-\nced counter corner vortex. Figure 3 shows some three\ndimensional views of the endwalls to aid visuali-\nzation of the profile shapes.\nThe bulk of the results in this paper were taken\nusing conventional five- and three-hole probes to\nobtain velocity components and loss. In this paper\nmeasurements are only presented at the axial plane\nused for reference, which is 28 per cent of an axial\nchord downstream of the trailing edge.\nEndwall profiling also has the general effect of\nkeeping the secondary loss and flow much closer to\nthe endwall [10]. This means that it is important to\nmeasure the boundary layer as well as the bulk flow\nat the measurement plane. For five-hole probe\nmeasurements the closest point to the endwall was\nFig. 1 Cascade layout\nTable 1 Design data for the Durham cascade\nInlet flow angle 42.758\nBlade exit angle 268.78\nBlade chord 224 mm\nBlade axial chord 181 mm\nBlade pitch 191 mm\nBlade half-span 200 mm\nReynolds number (axial\nchord and exit velocity)\n4.0 \u0002 105\n50 G Ingram, D Gregory-Smith, and N Harvey\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A06504 # IMechE 2005\n5 mm so a three-hole probe was used to capture\nimportant information close to the wall.\nMeasurement grids have to be adjusted to\naccommodate the curvature of the endwall at the\nmeasurement plane. There is a uniform tangential\nspacing of 7 mm. For five-hole traverses, radial\nsteps of 5 mm were used from 5 to 100 mm, and\nabove 100 mm a 10 mm spacing was used. The con-\ntoured grids are generated so that the perturbations\nfrom the endwall reduce towards mid-span. For the\nthree-hole probe, radial steps of 1 mm were used\nfrom 1 to 5 mm.\n3 EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY\nThe technique used for five-hole and three-hole\nprobe measurements was essentially the same as\nthat described in Treaster and Yocum [11]. Data\nacquisition was automated and a mechanised traverse\ngear moved the probe without human intervention.\nThis high level of automation allowed a relatively\nlarge number of traverses to be conducted.\nBefore commencing readings, the operation of all\nthe logging programs, transducers, probe, and the\nmost significant data processing programs was\ntested. Essentially a series of readings were carried\nout at a number of known angles and at zero loss.\nThe closeness to which the measurement system\nreturns the angles and zero loss gives an indication\nof the errors in the system. The test was also repeated\nafter a given set of readings, to ensure no degradation\nin the system had taken place during the tests.\nThe logging software contained two notable sub-\nroutines, which improved the quality of the experi-\nmental results. The first checked to ensure that the\nreading had settled after the probe had been moved\nthrough a flow field. Secondly, the data from each\nFig. 2 Endwall geometries: (a) P1 geometry; (b) P2 geometry\nFig. 3 (a) p1 geometry in 3D; (b) p2 geometry in 3D\nTurbine endwall profiling in a cascade 51\nA06504 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\nmeasurement point underwent a statistical test to\neliminate measurements with too much scatter in\nthe data.\nThe other key element in achieving good quantitat-\nive results is to achieve consistency in the process used\nto collect the results. To achieve this, the tests for each\nendwall were conducted sequentially. In fact the probe\nstarting position was set and locked in place; each\nendwall was inserted and tested in turn in a \u2018back to\nback\u2019 manner. This means that variations in probe\npositioning etc. did not affect the results.\nThe planar geometry was already quite efficient\nand the ranking of competing geometries required\neven more precision in the total pressure measure-\nment. The difference in total pressure loss between\nthe profiled endwalls is of the order of a few Pascals.\nThe loss changes are very small in absolute terms.\nIn order to provide \u2018definitive\u2019 results, the cascade\ntraverses have been conducted three times; the\ndifferences between each of these traverses give\nsome idea of the repeatability of the experiment\nand the average provides the \u2018definitive\u2019 result.\n3.1 Transitional flow studies\nSurface-mounted hot films were used to examine the\neffect endwall profiling has on the transitional nature\nof the flow. Measurements have been conducted\nboth on the blade surfaces and on the endwalls. A\ndetailed explanation of the experimental technique\nmay be found in Ingram [12].\n4 RESULTS\nContour plots of loss coefficient are presented for\nfive- and three-hole probe readings. These area\nplots show the results of averaging three separate\ntraverses for each endwall geometry (P0, P1, and P2).\nRepeating the experiment also allows an estimate\nof the accuracy of the final result to be made.\nThe difference between the averaged area plots\nand individual area plots is very small and so is not\nshown. For all the traverses at 128% Cax there is an\noverlap in the tangential direction of approximately\n0.3 blade pitch.\n4.1 Five-hole probe results for 128 per cent Cax\nFigure 4 shows the secondary vectors for the three\ncases. Secondary vectors are defined as deviations\nfrom the 2D midspan flow. The planar case (Fig. 4a)\nexhibits a classic secondary flow pattern with a large\npassage vortex located around t \u00bc 2250 mm,\nr \u00bc 60 mm. A smaller vortex associated with the\nsuction side of the horseshoe vortex and the trailing\nfilament vorticity is located above and to the left of\nthe main passage vortex at t \u00bc 2290 mm,\nr \u00bc 90 mm. The counter corner vortex is also just vis-\nible at t \u00bc 2310 mm, r \u00bc 10 mm.\nFig. 4 Secondary velocity vectors at 128 per cent Cax\n52 G Ingram, D Gregory-Smith, and N Harvey\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A06504 # IMechE 2005\nFigure 4b and c shows the changes that endwall\nprofiling introduces to the secondary flow field.\nFor P1 the passage vortex is smaller and closer to\nthe endwall and the enhanced counter corner\nvortex can also be clearly seen at t \u00bc 2290 mm,\nr \u00bc 15 mm. For P2 the passage vortex is again smaller\nand closer to the endwall; however, the overturning\nnear the endwall appears slightly greater for the\nprofiled case than for the planar case.\nFigure 5a\u2013c shows the loss coefficients for P0, P1,\nand P2, respectively. P1 and P2 reduce secondary\nflow and loss, with the passage vortex loss cores in\nFig. 5b and c being smaller than those in Fig. 5a. In\ngeneral, profiled endwalls increase the overturning\nat the endwalls. However, P1 does not increase over-\nturning with respect to the planar case. This is at the\nexpense of greater loss locally, as the enhanced\ncorner vortex generates a large amount of loss.\n4.2 Three-hole probe results for 128 per cent Cax\nFigure 6a shows close wall loss coefficient contours\nfor P0 at 128 per cent Cax. Figure 6b and c shows\nthe close wall loss coefficient for P1 and P2, respect-\nively. Note the expanded radial scale and the fact that\nthe profiling for P1 extends to beyond 128 per cent\nCax. Once again, the values shown are averaged\nvalues of three separate traverses. The area plots\nshow clearly the large region of increased loss associ-\nated with the enhanced corner vortex for P1,\nalthough the increased overturning for P2 does not\nmanifest itself as increased loss compared with the\nplanar case.\n4.3 Pitch averaged results for 128 per cent Cax\nFigure 7 shows the secondary kinetic energy coeffi-\ncient at 128 per cent Cax. This figure shows the\nsignificant reductions in Cske that are obtained with\nprofiled endwalls. In essence, Fig. 7 is a pitch-aver-\naged representation of the secondary flow dynamics\nseen in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the figure the\nsecond generation endwall has the greatest Cske\nreduction. Area-averaged values of Cske are included\nin Table 2, showing that the profiling reduces the\nCske by about 50 per cent.\nAs discussed above each profile has three\nmeasurements taken at 128 per cent Cax. Each of\nthese measurements was conducted from scratch\neach time, that is they were taken on different days\nand all the equipment was reset between traverses.\nSo for each set of readings the tangential position\nand yaw angle of the probe were reset. This allows\nus to quantify the repeatability of the experiments\nand estimate the effects of probe setting variation,\netc. The variation on area plots is very small between\ntraverses; however a small amount of variation can\nbe seen in the pitch averaged plots. An example of\nthe pitch-averaged loss variation is shown in Fig. 8,\nobtained with the five-hole probe. The degree of\nvariation appears to be very small with extremely\ngood qualitative agreement between the traverses.\nA full examination of the results shows that the\nFig. 5 Loss coefficient at 128 per cent Cax\nTurbine endwall profiling in a cascade 53\nA06504 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\nmaximum loss difference is over 0.1, but this is for\nonly one point close to the endwall on P1 (not\nshown) and a much more typical value would be\n0.02. Although not shown here, yaw angle agreement\nis excellent with all angles within half a degree of\neach other [12].\nArea averaged results are shown in Table 2 as well\nas in Fig. 9. The level of variation in loss results is\nquite surprising given the good agreement that is\napparently present in the pitch-averaged results.\nFor example, the planar secondary loss maximum\nvariation between different traverses is some 3.6 per\ncent of the mean value, which seems quite high\nwhen compared to the pitch averaged plots. For\neach set of readings for P0, P1, and P2, the mean\nand standard deviation was taken and twice the lar-\ngest standard deviation for the total and secondary\nloss calculation is used for the error bars. The error\nbars used in Fig. 9 are therefore set to 0.005. Should\nrepeated loss measurements follow a normal distri-\nbution, this means that the mean value plus or\nminus two standard deviations should encompass\n95.5 per cent of all readings. Obviously with such a\nsmall sample size such statistical methods are some-\nwhat suspect as a single \u2018rogue\u2019 value will have a big\neffect, but this is at least a rational way of assessing\nthe error associated with endwall measurements\nthat can be logically extended should further exper-\niments be conducted. Table 2 lists the mean and\nerror margins for loss measurements associated\nwith the three endwalls. The mean net secondary\nloss is also plotted in Fig. 9. Significantly it is appar-\nent both profile losses will offer improvements over\nthe planar case, but that the error bars for the P1\nand P2 cases overlap.\nFig. 6 Close wall loss coefficient at 128 per cent Cax\nTable 2 Mean loss and error estimate for five-hole probe\nreadings\nP0 P1 P2 Error\nTotal loss 0.1503 0.1336 0.1289 +0.005\nSecondary loss 0.0723 0.0554 0.0517 +0.004\nPercentage\nplanar loss\n100.0 76.5 71.4 +5.1\nCske 0.0203 0.0110 0.0092 \u2013\nCske percentage\nplanar\n100.0 54.0 45.5 \u2013\nFig. 7 Pitch-averaged Cske at 128 per cent Cax\n54 G Ingram, D Gregory-Smith, and N Harvey\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A06504 # IMechE 2005\nA similar exercise in repeating the measurements\nat 128 per cent Cax was conducted for three-hole\nprobe results as for the five-hole probe results.\nIn general similar results were obtained, with the\npitch averaged values showing good agreement but\nthe area-averaged values showing several percentage\npoints of variation between different measurements.\nThree-hole probe area-averaged numbers are shown\nin Table 3, which covers a radial extent of 0\u201315 mm.\nThe three-hole probe area-averaged loss results are\nthe gross figures, i.e. without the inlet boundary\nlayer subtracted, as subtracting either the whole\nboundary layer or only the first 15 mm from the\nthree-hole probe does not have much physical\nmeaning. The error estimate is calculated in an\nidentical manner as for the five-hole probe.\nThe P1 profile has the largest loss, which is\nexpected given the existence of the enhanced\ncorner vortex. The P2 geometry actually results in\na reduction in loss at the endwall. Clearly the\nenhanced corner vortex is a major loss-producing\nfeature, but the increased cross flow in P2 does\nnot appear to be contributing to increased loss\ncompared to the planar case. This is significant as\nHarvey et al. [2] point out one of the effects of end-\nwall profiling in general is to increase the overturning\nat the endwall.\n4.4 Synthesized data set\nIn order to obtain the best measurement of the\nchange in loss between endwalls of different design,\nthe three- and five-hole averaged data sets are\ncombined to produce a synthesized data set. This\ndata set consists of the three-hole readings up to\nand including 5 per cent of span, r \u00bc 10 mm for a\nplanar wall \u2013 the remainder of the data set is taken\nup by five-hole probe readings. Figure 10 shows the\nFig. 8 Repeatability of pitch-averaged loss\nFig. 9 Area-averaged loss coefficients (five-hole probe)\nTable 3 Mean loss and error estimate for three-hole\nprobe readings\nP0 P1 P2 Error\nGross loss, Cp0 0.3069 0.4149 0.2441 +0.04\nPercentage\nplanar loss\n100.0 135.2 79.5 +13.0\nFig. 10 Three- and five-hole results combined\nTurbine endwall profiling in a cascade 55\nA06504 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\npitch-averaged loss. The near wall loss is very high\ncompared with the passage vortex loss core but the\npercentage span that it covers is quite small.\nThe synthesized data set is mainly intended\nto examine the changes in the area averaged values\ncaused by including the three-hole probe measure-\nments. When the three-hole probe measurements\nare included, the P1 data increase by a greater\namount than the P2 data set. This is shown in\nTable 4, which contains values for the synthesized\ndata set. Figure 11 shows the net secondary loss of\nthe combined data set along with error bars taken\nfrom the five-hole data set. Figure 11 also shows\nthe change in secondary loss for each of the geome-\ntries when the three-hole readings are included.\nIncluding the close wall readings captures more\nof the loss of the P1-enhanced corner vortex and\nthe fact that P2 has a lower close wall loss than the\nplanar case means that the apparent performance\nof P2 relative to the datum is improved. If the error\nestimates are kept the same as for the five-hole\nprobe, the difference in secondary loss values for\nP1 and P2 are now greater than the expected range\nof experimental error.\n5 COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS\nThe design work on the profiles was carried out using\none of the turbomachinery CFD codes of Rolls-\nRoyce, based on the pressure correction algorithm\nof Moore [13]. The grid consisted of a modest\nnumber of points (approximately 100 000) as during\nthe design the calculation has to be repeated many\ntimes. An algebraic mixing length model and wall\nfunctions are used to model the flow. All surfaces\nare modelled as fully turbulent, as this would be\nthe practice used in a real design calculation. Further\ndetails may be found in Harvey et al. [2].\nThe same processing was applied to CFD data as\nexperimental data for this paper. Data points were\nextracted from the CFD solution at the measurement\ngrid locations. These CFD points were then placed in\na file in experimental format, then processed as if\nthey were experimental results. This ensured that\nthe results were directly comparable.\nFigure 12 shows pitch-averaged secondary loss\nand yaw angle for CFD and experiment for each geo-\nmetry. Secondary loss is plotted as the CFD mid-span\nloss is roughly twice that of the measured value. This\nis caused by the CFD modelling having fully turbu-\nlent boundary layers, whereas in the real cascade\nthe flow is transitional. Negative values of exper-\nimental loss are caused by small areas of negative\nloss at inlet. The negative loss at inlet arose from\nthe fact that the inlet boundary layer had a slight\n\u2018hump\u2019 in it caused by a jetting effect from the turbu-\nlence grid and this feature of the Durham Cascade is\ndescribed in more detail in Ingram [12].\nFor the P0 case we see that the CFD predicts the\npassage vortex loss core and the reduction of loss at\n10\u201320% of span quite well, but gets some details\nwrong. There is a pronounced hump and dip in the\nCFD passage vortex loss core which does not occur\nin the experimental results. This appears to be a con-\nsequence of the CFD overpredicting boundary layer\nloss, which is then fed into the vortex associated\nwith suction side of the horseshoe vortex and the\ntrailing edge vorticity. The loss core associated with\nthe passage vortex appears to be the lower \u2018hump\u2019\nat around 25 per cent of span.\nFor the P1 case the passage vortex loss core is over-\npredicted in strength but the CFD does capture the\nincreased loss associated with the enhanced corner\nTable 4 Combined three- and five-hole probe loss\nreadings\nP0 P1 P2 Error\nTotal loss, Cp0 0.1574 0.1431 0.1322 +0.005\nSecondary loss 0.0807 0.0650 0.0557 +0.004\nPercentage\nplanar loss\n100.0 80.5 69.0 +5.1\nFig. 11 Area-averaged secondary loss of the combined\nand five-hole-only data\n56 G Ingram, D Gregory-Smith, and N Harvey\nProc.

The dip in loss between the endwall losses\nand the passage vortex loss core is underpredicted,\nwith the CFD predicting more loss than is actually\npresent. A similar story is seen for P2, with the\npassage vortex being overpredicted and the endwall\nloss being captured accurately. However the dip in\nloss between the endwall loss and the passage\nvortex loss core is greater than occurs in reality.\nTable 5 shows the CFD loss. This quantifies the\nremarks made in the previous paragraph. Secondary\nloss is the main parameter under consideration as\nthis removes the effect of the blade boundary layer\nmodelling to a great extent and the turbomachinery\ndesigner can examine secondary loss with the prior\nknowledge that the modelling of the mid-span flow\nis incorrect. However even when examining second-\nary loss (compared with Table 2), the CFD prediction\nof loss is incorrect. For P1 a small increase in loss is\npredicted and for P2 the loss is considerably over-\nestimated. This is not particularly surprising, as many\nother experimenters have found that CFD predicts\nloss badly for turbomachinery applications. In a\nsituation where loss measurement is difficult as the\nplanar case is already quite efficient and the changes\nbetween endwalls are small, CFD would not be\nexpected to give accurate loss results. The endwalls\nwere designed in the expectation that the loss predic-\ntion would be poor and the profiles (P1 and P2) were\ndesigned on the basis of reducing secondary flow and\nnot on predicted loss reduction.\nYaw angles are also shown in Fig. 12; the CFD data\nhas been adjusted to give the same mid-span angle\nas the experimental data, but the size of this adjust-\nment is very small at less than half a degree. The P0\ncase actually appears to agree the least well with\nthe experimental data. Peak underturning and over-\nturning are predicted in slightly the wrong places\nand the predicted overturning in the planar case is\nmuch greater than that which actually occurs. There\nis a difference of up to 2.58 between the experimental\nFig. 12 Pitch-averaged experimental data compared with CFD\nTable 5 CFD loss predictions\nP0 CFD P1 CFD P2 CFD\nTotal loss, Cp0 0.2227 0.2212 0.2159\nMid-span loss 0.1509 0.1489 0.1491\nSecondary loss 0.0716 0.0723 0.0668\nPercentage planar\ncase loss\n100.0 101.0 93.3\nTurbine endwall profiling in a cascade 57\nA06504 # IMechE 2005 Proc.

Predictions for the\nprofiled endwalls appear slightly better with some\ndiscrepancies between the position of peak under-\nturning, but the reduced overturning at the wall\nwith P1 and the increased overturning at the wall\nfor P2 are captured accurately.\n6 HOT FILM MEASUREMENTS\nMoore and Gregory-Smith [9] and Harrison [14] both\nshowed that there are significant areas of transition\non endwalls in turbine cascades. If the loss reduction\ncaused by endwall profiling is significantly due to the\nchanging the state of the boundary layer, its general\napplicability is somewhat limited. In this paper a\nbrief selection of surface-mounted hot film results\nare presented.\nThe results of the surface-mounted hot films are\navailable in the form of a time dependent non-\ndimensionalized heat transfer parameter. Figure 13\nshows typical traces, here for 55 per cent axial\nchord on the suction surface. Near the endwall the\nflow is turbulent where the influence of the second-\nary flow is strong. Towards mid-span the flow is\nnearly completely laminar for the two-dimensional\nflow over the blade profile at this position. The differ-\nences between the three endwalls are not great, but\nsome differences can be seen at 15 and 25 per cent\nspan, with the profiled endwalls having a slightly\nmore turbulent appearance. On the endwalls (not\nshown), the differences are not so clear between\nlaminar and turbulent flow regions. However the\nreadings do indicate that transition is not the major\ncause of the loss reduction in the blade row. The\nhot film measurements do show the relaminarisation\ndescribed by Moore and Gregory-Smith [9], they\nused hot wires rather than hot films, so this gives\nconfidence in the current technique. Further details\nmay be found in Ingram [12].\nReal machines operate at a variety of Reynolds\nnumbers, some of which are several times higher\nthat the Durham cascade. If the benefits of endwall\nprofiling were derived significantly from altering the\ntransition of the endwall or blade surface, the appli-\ncability of the technique to a wide variety of real\nmachines would be in doubt. However the above\nresults, along with evidence from engine representa-\ntive rig tests [6, 7] suggest that this is not the case.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has presented details of the quantitative\nperformance of three endwall geometries, a planar\nreference case and two non-axisymmetric profiled\nendwalls. Owing to the small differences bet-\nween endwalls, ranking the profiles is quite a difficult\nFig. 13 Surface-mounted hot film results\n58 G Ingram, D Gregory-Smith, and N Harvey\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A06504 # IMechE 2005\nexercise and considerable attention must be paid\nto experimental technique. The following key\npoints emerge:\n. careful experimental technique is vital and, due to\nthe small differences being measured, repetition of\nthe experiments is advised in order to ascertain the\namount of variation in the experiments;\n. a quantitative ranking of three profiled endwalls has\nbeen undertaken with a realistic estimate of the error\nmargins associated with the measurements;\n. profiled endwalls have been shown to reduce\nsecondary loss by 31 per cent with an error esti-\nmate of +5 per cent;\n. CFD does not predict absolute values of loss for\nprofiled endwalls nor the trends in loss production\nwith endwall profiling. CFD does predict the yaw\nangle changes introduced by endwall profiling;\nthe trends and the absolute values are captured\naccurately;\n. increased overturning at the endwall is not necess-\narily accompanied by an increase in loss near the\nendwall;\n. the transitional flow effects seen in cascades by\nMoore and Gregory-Smith [9] and Harrison [14]\nappear not to be affected by endwall profiling.\nThis means the benefits of endwall profiling are\nnot due to changes in the transitional state of the\nboundary layers.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been carried out with the support of\nRolls-Royce plc, QinetiQ, MoD, and DTI CARAD.\nThe authors would like to thank them for funding it\nand their permission to publish this paper.\nREFERENCES\n1 Sieverding, C.
