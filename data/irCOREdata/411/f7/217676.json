The paper concludes that it\nis not sufficient to revitalize PHC of the Alma Ata Declaration but it must be reframed in light of the above\ndiscussion.\nIntroduction\nIn 1978, member States of the World Health Organiza-\ntion (WHO) attending the meeting in Alma Ata sup-\nported the policy of Primary Health Care (PHC) [1].\nThis policy shifted the focus of health improvements\nfrom mere provision of health services to the larger con-\ntext of the relationship between health and social and\neconomic development. Thirty years later, WHO and its\nregional affiliates called for PHC to be revitalised [2].\nThe purpose of this paper is to identify the major chal-\nlenges to this call and investigate the commitments\nnecessary to achieve this objective. It argues that today\nit is not sufficient to seek ways of revitalizing PHC.\nRather it is necessary to reframe this policy to incorpo-\nrate present issues arising from the national and global\ncontext.\nBackground\nPHC analyzed the reasons for health improvements\nbeyond the technical biomedical intervention paradigm.\nIt argued that other factors were equally important\ndeterminants. PHC in 1978 was underpinned by the\nconcept of social justice and identified the main princi-\nples of equity and social justice as key to health\nimprovements. It also highlighted the role of prevention,\nmultisectoral collaboration, appropriate technology and\nsustainability. The need to improve the lot of those liv-\ning in abject poverty was a major emphasis. PHC was a\nstatement of values as much as a strategy for health\ncare. The present call to \u201crevitalize\u201d PHC is to once\nagain bring these values \u201cto life; to animate\u201d them [3].\nIt can be argued, however, that PHC in the global\ncontext of health care and health needs more than revi-\ntalization. It is necessary to re-\"frame or shape\u201d [3] PHC\nso that these principles can be translated from rhetoric\ninto reality. The struggle to put policy to practice in\nPHC can be seen in the debate between Comprehensive\nand Selective PHC. The former argued that health\nimprovements including those related to major diseases\nneeded to be addressed in a context where health care\ndelivery takes account of the principles and approaches\ndescribed above. The latter argued to achieve PHC, it\nwas necessary to focus on disease control targeting on\n* Correspondence: m.r.bhatia@lse.ac.uk\n1Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics, Houghton\nStreet,London, WC2A 2AE, UK\nBhatia and Rifkin Globalization and Health 2010, 6:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/13\n\u00a9 2010 Bhatia and Rifkin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Comprehensive PHC has\nshown some remarkable successes, although it has not\nbeen a history of smooth progression. Notable examples\nof good programs have been seen in the NGO (non-\ngovernment organizations) sector. These programs are\noften small scale projects run by charismatic leaders.\nIllustrations include Jamkhed in India which became a\nmodel for comprehensive PHC. It provided evidence of\nthe value of Community Health Workers (CHWs) and a\ncommunity development approach to health. Other\nexamples can be found in the book by Taylor-Ide and\nTaylor [5].\nOn a national scale evidence is more restricted. The\nworld\u2019s two most populated countries returned to PHC\nprinciples to address the health needs of the poor.\nChina was the country that inspired PHC thinking\nthrough its attention to rural health care and the use of\nlocal people called \u201cbarefoot doctors\u201d (CHWs) to give\nfirst line health care. After a period of market oriented\nreforms in health care and the resulting deterioration of\nthe health of rural people who are the nation\u2019s popula-\ntion, China is now committing huge additional resources\nto revitalising rural networks based on PHC [6]. India,\nwhich was one of the first countries to create a national\ncommunity health worker scheme after the Alma Ata\nconference and subsequently saw the scheme disappear\nwithin 10 years, has now begun to revive the program\nin the context of the National Rural Health Mission [7].\nThailand having adopted a \u201cBasic Needs\u201d approach in\nthe 1970s established a health system based on an alli-\nance between, government and NGOs that integrated\nPHC programs into other development programs. This\nalliance has produced both better health and economic\nimprovements [8].\nThe year 2008 celebrated 30 years of PHC policy. Two\nmajor reports, the World Health Report 2008 [9] and\nthe Report of the Commission on the Social Determi-\nnants of Health from WHO [10] provided key contribu-\ntions to this celebration. Both reaffirmed the relevance\nof PHC in terms of its vision and values in today\u2019s\nworld. In addition, a number of articles in the special\nissue of The Lancet [11] and in the Global Social Health\nPolicy Forum written by public health researchers and\nactivists summarise the influence of PHC on health pol-\nicy [12]. However, at the risk of an understatement, the\nworld has changed radically since 1978. The world in\n2008, can be broadly described as one characterised by\nglobalisation, rapid communication and an increasing\ngap between rich and poor. In the context of health and\nhealth care it can be described as one which has seen a\nshift from major concerns about communicable diseases\nto chronic diseases (from targeted single interventions\nto concerns about environment, life style and beha-\nviour); ideological changes (as dictated by neoliberal\neconomics and new public management) along with\ndominance of Bretton Woods institutions over the UN\norganisations resulted in developing countries embra-\ncing market oriented health sector reforms [13]; and a\nshift from medical professional monopoly on decisions\nand resource allocation to a much wider role for lay\npeople [14]. This situation presents large challenges and\ndemands serious rethinking about the PHC vision.\nChallenge One: Agreeing upon definitions\nThere is a challenge of getting a consensus among those\ninvolved in health care delivery and policy that health\nimprovements must be seen in the context of linking\nhealth care and human development. In 1978, the idea\nof seeing health as a reflection of the wider socio-\neconomic determinants was questioned by many of\nthose working in the field of health. In putting forward\nthe PHC policy, WHO used the personal experiences of\npeople to give evidence of the link between health and\ndevelopment. Drawn mainly from less developed coun-\ntry experiences, those who contributed to this analysis\nwere often charismatic doctors whose leadership and life\nimproved the health of the poor with whom they\nworked. Coinciding with the widely reported achieve-\nments in health improvements in the newly created Peo-\nples\u2019 Republic of China that viewed health as integral to\ndevelopment, the arguments that health was more than\nmedicine and services gained credence among providers\nand policy makers. A book entitled \u201cHealth by the Peo-\nple\u201d edited by Dr. Ken Newell, head of the division that\ncrafted the PHC policy published proof of these accom-\nplishments [15].\nHowever, these views and arguments were not shared\nby the majority of those involved in health care. Many\nbelieved that there was little hard evidence to support\nthe view that the socio-economic environment was as\ncritical to health improvements as medicine and service\ndelivery. As a result, although the arguments of social\njustice and equity were received with sympathy, imple-\nmentation of policy mostly focused on service provision.\nOne example is selective vs. comprehensive debate dis-\ncussed above.\nAnother was the confusion of the concepts \u201cPrimary\nHealth Care\u201d and \u201cprimary care\u201d. Those concerned with\nhealth care delivery could embrace the PHC vision in\nthe context of service delivery for which they were\nresponsible. As a result their focus became providing\nfirst line health services, \u201cprimary care\u201d, for communities\nbut not engaging in the wider analysis of conditions in\nwhich the poor health problems were created nor ser-\niously engaging in activities to promote equity and com-\nmunity participation. The concept of primary care for\nBhatia and Rifkin Globalization and Health 2010, 6:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/13\nPage 2 of 5\nmany of these people was interchangeable with Primary\nHealth Care and has continued to be so. A recent spe-\ncial issue of Lancet on 30 years of celebration of Alma\nAta is a good example of the confusion in the under-\nstanding of differences between these two concepts [11].\nA lack of a wider context for dialogue of the causes of\nand solutions to poor health creates considerable confu-\nsion for both policy planners and program implemen-\nters. In an attempt to clarify the relationship between\nPrimary Health Care and primary care the Report of the\nCommission on the Social Determinants of Health\nstates:\n\u201cThe Alma Ata Declaration promoted Primary\nHealth Care (PHC) as its central means toward good\nand fair global health\u2013not simply health services at\nthe primary care level (though that was important)\nbut rather a health system model that acted also on\nthe underlying social, economic and political causes\nof poor health\u201d. [[10]: pg.33].\nA commitment to reject the duality between Compre-\nhensive PHC and Selective PHC and an agreement for a\nstandard definition of PHC and the attributes it encom-\npasses is necessary to create solid frameworks for policy\nanalysis and health promotion.\nChallenge Two: Ensuring equity\nA second challenge is addressing the equity implications of\nthe market oriented reforms introduced in number of\ndeveloping countries. The Report of the Commission on\nthe Social Determinants of Health highlighted equity, both\nin terms of distribution but also in terms of power and\npolitics. Both PHC and the Report of the Commission call\nfor universal coverage. They highlight problem of market\noriented approaches and give evidence of its failure to\nmeet objectives for improving health for the poor.\nThe reduced access to health care as a result of the\nStructural Adjustment Programs (SAP) of the 1980s\nprovides the most graphic example illustrated by the\nreduction of life expectancy in Africa [16]. In the field\nof health, these programs combined with neo-liberal\nemphasis on the role of the market economy to improve\nefficiency and effectiveness has resulted in the promo-\ntion of a health system reforms (HSR). These market\noriented reforms include decentralization, public private\npartnerships, promotion of the private sector, and intro-\nduction of user charges [17,18]. Although often couched\nin the PHC principles of equity and participation, they\nrespond to the demands of efficiency at the cost of\nequity considerations [13]. As a result, short-term gains,\nin many cases, have overridden longer-term concerns\nthat address the root cause of poverty and poor health\n[19].\nEquity implications of the market oriented reforms are\nwell documented. A classic example is the introduction\nof user charges. User charges for health care were intro-\nduced as a part of the structural adjustment programs\nin number of countries. However, the expected benefits\nin terms of efficiency and equity were not forthcoming.\nThe negative consequences in terms of access and utili-\nsation of health services were observed especially among\nthe lower socio-economic groups across countries.\nGiven the highly regressive nature of user charges and\nthe lack of effective exemption mechanisms, it is there-\nfore not surprising to observe number of countries in\nSub-Sahara Africa have abolished user fees or are in the\nprocess of doing so [20].\nAt the global level, the global public private partner-\nships (i.e. Global alliance on vaccine initiative (GAVI),\nGlobal funds for Aids, TB and Malaria (GFATM) have\nfunded technology for health focusing on profit rather\nthan people and have re-enforced vertical disease pro-\ngram approach. This approach has been criticised for\ndistorting national priorities, weakening the comprehen-\nsive integrated health systems approach and supporting\nre-verticalization of planning [21] as energies are direc-\nted towards implementing specific vertical disease\nprograms.\nChallenge Three: Supporting community\nparticipation and empowerment\nA final major challenge is to examine and seek ways for-\nward to develop local community commitments. Com-\nmunity participation was identified as a key principle of\nPHC. There was little distinction between participation\nas community mobilisation (having community people\naccept professionals\u2019 assessment and activities for health\nimprovements) and community empowerment (trans-\nforming attitudes and behaviours that enable commu-\nnity\/individuals take decisions about their own lives). In\nrecent years, recognition of the differences has increased\nand the term participation has increasingly been\nreplaced by empowerment, calling attention to the\nimportance of power and control over decisions, espe-\ncially resource allocation.\nThe direct link between community participation and\nempowerment has not been easy to establish [22]. How-\never the link has been strengthened by a recent systema-\ntic review undertaken by the Working Group on\nCommunity Based Primary Health of the American Pub-\nlic Health Association [23]. In a paper published in Glo-\nbal Public Health their findings show that community\ninvolvement including house to house visits by health\nstaff, group meetings for education and support on\nhealth issues, outreach workers providing health services\nin the community and a community level (CHW) health\nworker to support community based health management\nBhatia and Rifkin Globalization and Health 2010, 6:13\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/13\nPage 3 of 5\nhas measurable effects on improvement of child survival.\nThey also highlight empowering communities (meaning\ncommunity people gain skills, information and confi-\ndence to make decisions about their choices affecting\ntheir own lives) as an overarching strategy that under-\npins these gains.\nIssues around participation and empowerment also\nhave been promoted in the context of governance of\nhealth service provision. A growing literature argues\nthat concerns about accountability of public expendi-\ntures should be placed in the hands of those intended\nbeneficiaries of those services. These issues centre on\nboth the accountability of services to perform to the\nsatisfaction of the users and the accountability of\nfinances to be used in the way in which they have been\nallocated. Concerns are developed in discussion about\n\u201cvoice\u201d whereby service users have the ability and capa-\ncity to demand the providers perform to user satisfac-\ntion. Evidence from the implementation of the Bamako\nInitiative shows how accountability can catalyze\nimprovement in efficiency and effectiveness of local ser-\nvice delivery [24].\nCommitments to meet this challenge continually\ndemand professionals to hold serious dialogues with\nthose for whom they provide service and care. To date\nthis dialogue has often been delayed by several factors.\nFirstly, there is the existence of attitudes of professionals\nwho tend to disregard opinions and views of those out-\nside the profession. Secondly, there is the historic view\nthat health interventions can only be verified by out-\ncome measures. This view ignores the vital role of pro-\ncess in sustaining the improvements that bio-medicine\nand technology contribute. The World Health Report\n2008 discusses in detail the role of service providers yet\ndoes not address the second issue of process. Commit-\nment to addressing both issues is critical to PHC in the\npresent context.\nConclusion\nAbove we have identified the challenges and necessary\ncommitments that need to be addressed if PHC is to\nremain relevant. Revitalizing PHC principles without\ndeveloping a framework to address concrete measures\nfor health improvements is not sufficient. The chal-\nlenges discussed above need to be examined in a sys-\ntematic and integrated way to produce flexible policy\noptions and solutions that can be implemented. To do\nthis, particularly in a time of financial crisis, requires a\nwillingness to dialogue and appreciate a range of differ-\nent and often contradictory views working toward con-\nsensus. It is clear that more of the same will not answer\nincreasingly risky situations emerging from not only lack\nof money but also climate change, international political\ntensions and growing anxiety about resource availability\ndue to rapidly expanding global populations. This does\nsuggest that perhaps revitalizing PHC is not sufficient.\nWhat is needed is a reframing of the concept in light of\nthe above discussions around the issues identified.\nAcknowledgements\nDr Bhatia spent some of his buy-out time working on this paper and so\nwould like to acknowledge the TISS-LSE Tata project funded by Tata Trust\nfor supporting his buy-out.\nAuthor details\n1Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics, Houghton\nStreet,London, WC2A 2AE, UK. 2Institute of Social Psychology, London School\nof Economics, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, UK.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nBoth authors have contributed to the planning, writing and editing of this\npaper.
