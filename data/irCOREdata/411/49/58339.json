Introduction \n \nThe 13C\/12C ratio of carbon in plants depends on the composition of atmospheric \nCO2, and a wide variety of factors which affect plant growth and influence the carbon \nisotope fractionation associated with photosynthesis (Farquhar et al., 1989). These \nfactors include the local environmental conditions in which the plant grows: particularly \nthe natural properties of the climate and soil affecting water availability, and any \nmodifications resulting from cultivation. Because of this, 13C\/12C analyses of the \npreserved remains of archaeological plants are becoming increasingly relevant to studies \nof the nature of past environmental conditions, the development of agriculture, and the \ndietary habits of ancient populations (Aguilera et al., 2008; Araus and Buxo, 1993; \nAraus et al., 1997; Araus et al., 2003; Araus et al., 2001; Ferrio et al., 2006; Ferrio et al., \n2005; Heaton, 1999; Marino and DeNiro, 1987; Ogrinc and Budja, 2005; Riehl et al., \n2008; Tieszen, 1991) \nThe conclusions drawn in such studies often involve interpretation of differences \nin 13C\/12C ratios based on data for a limited number of samples, and a proper \ninterpretation of such data must be founded on an appreciation of the significance of \nspatial or temporal differences in the 13C\/12C ratios of plants (Codron et al., 2005; \nHeaton, 1999; Tieszen, 1991; Vanklinken et al., 1994). This understanding can only be \nderived from 13C\/12C analysis of modern plants. However, although such analyses are \nwidely used in botanical studies, very few studies of 13C\/12C variations among modern \nplants have been specifically directed toward a better understanding of archaeological \nsamples (Codron et al., 2005; Heaton, 1999). \nOur interest in the spatial and temporal variations in wheat 13C\/12C ratios was \nprompted by our analysis of a large number of samples of charred wheat grains from a \nBronze Age tell site near the modern village of Assiros in N. Greece (Fig. 1). Wheat is a \nparticularly important crop in the farming history of SW Asia and Europe and, where its \ngrains are preserved by charring, 13C\/12C analysis has been used as a basis for \ninvestigations of water availability, irrigation, and cereal productivity in prehistoric \nagriculture (Aguilera et al., 2008; Araus and Buxo, 1993; Araus et al., 2003; Araus et \nal., 2001; Ferrio et al., 2005). In this work we present data for the 13C\/12C variations \nwhich may be found among samples of modern wheat grain, assess the likely effects of \ncharring, and use the results as a basis for interpreting 13C\/12C data for samples from \nBronze Age Assiros Toumba. \n 1.1. Assiros Toumba \n \nExcavations at Assiros Toumba revealed a number of storerooms burned to the \nground about 1300 BC (Wardle, 1987; Wardle, 1988; Wardle, 1989). Large quantities \nof grain, originally held in clay bins, clay-lined baskets and large ceramic storage jars \n(pithoi), had been preserved by charring and burial beneath the collapsed roofs of the \nrooms. The containers held a variety of crop species including barley, broomcorn millet, \nbitter vetch, and several species of wheat: einkorn (Triticum monococcum), emmer (T. \ndicoccum), the \u2018new type\u2019 glume wheat, spelt (T. spelta) and, not distinguishable from \none another, either bread wheat (T. aestivum) or durum wheat (T. durum) (Jones et al., \n2000; Jones et al., 1986). The spelt and emmer were normally found together, and may \nhave been grown together as a mixed crop, or \u2018maslin\u2019 (Jones, 1987). \nThe six excavated storerooms had a combined floor area of at least 90-100 m2 \nthat was entirely given over to storage of crops and, to date, no habitation space has \nbeen uncovered from this phase of the site\u2019s history. This remarkable concentration of \nfood storage, which invites comparison with the much larger and much grander \n\u2018palatial\u2019 complexes of Bronze Age S. Greece, poses the question of whether this \ncentralised storage was under elite control or represented a communal initiative \n(Andreou, 2001; Jones et al., 1986). A related question is whether it represents storage \nof a single year\u2019s harvest gathered from a wide geographical area \u2013 implying that the \ninhabitants of Assiros Toumba had far-reaching influence - and\/or storage of more than \none year\u2019s harvest \u2013 implying the holding back of surplus as a provision against \nsubsequent crop failure. \nBecause 13C\/12C ratios of plants are sensitive to environmental conditions, and \nsuch conditions are likely to differ in space and time, we postulated that wheat grain \nfrom different sites and different years might display different 13C\/12C ratios. On this \nbasis analysis of the 13C\/12C ratios of the Assiros Toumba grain might provide \ninformation on the origin of the harvest\/s. \n \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Modern samples \n \nWe present data for modern samples of wheat collected from three sources: \n \n(1) whole plants of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare cv. \u2018Mercia\u2019) from \nfield trial plots at Sutton Bonington, University of Nottingham, England, harvested in \nJuly 1997; \n(2) ears of archived samples of einkorn (T. monococcum), emmer (T. dicoccum), \nand spelt (T. spelta) from the John Innes Centre (Norwich, England) harvested in 1981, \n1985, 1992 and 1999 with the different species grown under identical conditions; \n(3) grain of einkorn and of the Athos variety of durum wheat (T. durum), harvested \nbetween 1991 and 2002, from agricultural research stations at Thessaloniki and Agios \nMamas  in N. Greece, ca. 30 and 65 km from Assiros respectively; grain of the Athos \nvariety of durum wheat, harvested in 1994 and 1995, from research stations in N., C. \nand S. Greece; and grain of the Apulo, Cosmodur and Simeto varieties of durum wheat, \nharvested in 1995 and 1998, from individual farmers around Assiros and nearby villages \n(Fig. 1). The crops were all rain-fed, i.e. received no artificial irrigation. \n \n2.2. Charring experiments \n \nEach charring experiment involved placing a crucible with 20-30 grains of \nmodern, air-dried einkorn in a hot oven. Two samples of einkorn were used, one from \nGreece and one from France, with charring at 210, 220, 240 and 250oC for 3 days open \nto the atmosphere (\u2018open\u2019), or for 3 or 5 days closed to the atmosphere by wrapping in \ntin foil and burying in sand (\u2018closed\u2019). These conditions were chosen on the basis of \nearlier charring experiments, which have shown that they provide the closest replication \nof those under which Bronze Age samples at Assiros Toumba were charred \n(unpublished data). \n \n2.3. Bronze Age wheat from Assiros Toumba \n \n Charred grain was recovered from the containers in the storeroom complex by \nflotation of their contents. Flotation samples were taken from the most dense \nconcentration of plant remains within each container and also from the more mixed \ndeposits between concentrations. Grain was submitted for isotopic analysis only from \nthe purest, densest concentrations, the locations of which are shown in Fig. 2. \n \n2.4. Analytical methods \n \nSamples were oven dried at 50oC. Thorough grinding and homogenisation of \nmodern grains is important, because the more resistant grain coats were found to have \n\uf06413C values typically 1\u2030 lower than the softer interiors (see below). In the earliest part \nof the study individual whole grains were ground by hand in an agate mortar and pestle. \nThe <250 micron and >250 micron portions were separated, weighed, analysed \nindividually, and the whole grain \uf06413C value calculated by mass balance. Later samples \nwere whole ground and homogenised in a liquid N2 freezer mill (SPEX). Charred \nsamples were easily ground and homogenised by hand. \n13C\/12C ratio analyses were performed by combustion in a Carlo Erba NA1500 \nelemental analyser on-line to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass \nspectrometer. The ratios are reported as \uf06413C values in per mille (\u2030), where: \n3\n12\n13\n12\n13\n13 101 \uf0b4\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03d\nreference\nsample\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\uf064  \nwith values calculated to the VPDB reference by comparison with co-run laboratory \nstandards (of plant material) calibrated against NBS-19 and NBS-22. Replicate analysis \nof well-mixed samples indicated a precision of + <0.08\u2030 (1 SD, n = 8). %C and %N \nwere determined by reference to an acetanilide standard. \n \n \n3. \uf06413C variations in modern wheat grain \n \n3.1. Variations within a harvest \n \nThe variation in the \uf06413C values of grain from Mercia bread wheat (Sutton \nBonington, England) at different spatial scales is shown in Table 1. Differences between \ngrains from the same spikelets are generally small, about 0.1\u2030, only slightly higher \nthan the standard deviation of the analytical precision. Grains from different spikelet \npositions on the same ear, however, displayed a progressive increase in \uf06413C value \ntoward the top of the ear, with a particularly large difference at the terminal spikelet \n(Fig. 3). The resulting within-ear standard deviations were about 0.4 and 0.6\u2030. \nDeviations of a similar magnitude, typically 0.3 to 0.7\u2030, are also found within single \nplants (different ears on the same plant), among different plants on the same plot, and \namong grains randomly sampled from single harvests (Table 1). \nFrom the data in Table 1 it appears that much of the 0.3 to 0.7\u2030 variation in \n\uf06413C values among individual grains of a particular harvest can be traced to variations \nwithin individual ears, reflecting the relatively uniform ripening for which domesticated \ncereals have been selected. The variation within individual ears probably reflects both \nthe changing environmental conditions and variety of sources of carbon used during the \ngrowth of wheat grains (Abbad et al., 2004; Araus et al., 1992; Blum, 1998; Bort et al., \n1996; Plaut et al., 2004). Much of the carbon may be derived from photosynthetic \nfixation occurring during grain filling, which utilises both atmospheric CO2 and \ninternally-respired CO2. Under conditions of stress (e.g. reduced water availability, \nspreading foliar disease, onset of senescence) that tend to occur at this time, however, \ngrain filling may also utilise earlier-assimilated carbon remobilised from the stem. With \ngrains at different positions on the ear filling at slightly different times, temporal \nvariations in these factors may be expected to cause variations in grain \uf06413C values \nalong the ear, with the least variation at the scale of the individual spikelet. \n Variation in whole grain \uf06413C values may also arise as a result of variations in \ncomposition. Crude separation of individual Mercia grains into different components \nshowed that the coat-rich and embryo-rich portions of a grain had \uf06413C values about 1\u2030 \nlower than the endosperm. This corresponds to the known tendency for biochemical \ncomponents to fractionate \uf06413C values in the order \uf06413Clipid < \uf06413Cprotein < \uf06413Ccarbohydrate \n(Dungait et al., 2008; Lichtfouse et al., 1995). It is not known to what extent variations \nin the proportions of the different components of a grain influenced whole grain \uf06413C \nvalues in Table 1. Apart from grains on the terminal spikelets of Fig. 3, which had a \nlower mass than other grains, there was no clear relationship between grain size and \n\uf06413C value. We note, however, that the chaff, which might be expected to be more \ncompositionally uniform than the grain, did tend to show less variation in \uf06413C along the \near (Fig. 3). \n We may gauge the significance of these within harvest variations by assuming a \ntypical 1 SD variation of 0.5\u2030. If two samples were to be compared, with each based \non analysis of, for example, 5 grains, then a Students t-test would require the mean \nvalues of the samples to differ by at least 0.7\u2030 for them to be considered significantly \ndifferent at the 95% confidence level. When differences of this magnitude (i.e. about \n0.7\u2030) are found in studies of archaeological wheat, they can only be regarded as \nsignificant when they are based on much larger numbers of grains. \n \n3.2. Differences between harvests \n\uf020\n\uf06413C values for durum and einkorn grain from harvests of different years and \ndifferent locations in Greece are shown in Table 2, and Figs. 4 and 5. Inter-annual \nvariations at Agios Mamas and Thessaloniki were highly variable, ranging up to 2.7\u2030 \nbetween some years, but with insignificant differences between other years (Fig. 4). \nZhao et al. (2001) reported more modest inter-annual variations of 0 to about 1.3\u2030 for \nunfertilised wheat grain grown at Rothamsted, England, during the past 150 years, and \nfound no clear relationship to rainfall. At semi-arid Agios Mamas and Thessaloniki, \nrainfall is more likely to be the limiting factor on cereal growth and so to influence the \nisotopic composition of grain, although these relationships are far from simple. Because \nwinter rainfall is modest and unreliable in northern Greece, spring rainfall may be \ncritical to grain filling, as indicated by a local saying that predicts a happy outcome for \nfarmers \u2018if it rains twice in April and once in May\u2019. Spring rainfall is less important \nafter a wet winter, however, and its benefits may conversely be neutralised by \ndesiccating early summer winds. Finally, in examining possible relationships between \nrainfall and \uf06413C values, agricultural stations (such as Agios Mamas) emphasise that \ntheir weather data are far from infallible. More reliable readings may be available from \ndistant meteorological stations, but these data are probably irrelevant in a region subject \nto acute local variation in rainfall. \nThere is nevertheless some suggestion that rainfall in May \u2013 i.e. in the weeks \nbefore typical mid-June to early July harvesting \u2013 could have an effect on durum grain \n\uf06413C values at Agios Mamas. For six of the ten sampled years \uf06413C values were between \n-25.6 and -24.8\u2030, with May rainfall between 17 and 59 mm (average 36 mm). In \ncontrast, three of the four years having significantly higher \uf06413C values (-23.9 to \n-23.3\u2030), corresponded to a very dry May with \u22644 mm (1995, 1997, 2002). The fourth \nyear with a high \uf06413C value (2001) followed a very wet May (84 mm), but farmers in \nAssiros reported that this was offset by hot and desiccating southerly winds in May and \nthe same may have happened at Agios Mamas. The \uf06413C values from Thessaloniki are \nmore difficult to interpret: a high value for 1997 followed the driest May of the decade \nand that for 1993, which followed a wet spring, might be attributed to desiccating winds \nthat again caused problems in Assiros, but high values in 1998-99 cannot be explained \non available climatic evidence. \nClimate and other factors influencing water availability, such as soil condition, \nvary with location. Geographic differences in \uf06413C must therefore also be anticipated. \nAs expected, these are found to depend on the degree of spatial separation of the sites. \nSingle varieties of durum wheat harvested in the same year from different fields around \nAssiros, and around neighbouring villages up to 10 km from Assiros, displayed a \nmaximum difference in \uf06413C values of only 1.3\u2030 (Fig. 5). In contrast, single varieties \nof durum from about 35 km apart (Agios Mamas and Thessaloniki) differed by up to \n2.2\u2030 (Fig. 4), whilst those from locations several hundred kilometres apart differed by \nup to 3.2\u2030 (Fig. 5). \nSamples having large differences in \uf06413C values are therefore likely to reflect \neither harvests from widely separate locations, or harvests from different years. \nHowever, such spatial or temporal differences are not precluded where samples have \nessentially identical \uf06413C values: in 1995 durum wheat from Assiros had \uf06413C values \nclose to those of durum from Tripoli in southern Greece (Fig. 5), and harvests from \ndifferent years can have very similar \uf06413C values (Fig. 4). \n \n3.3. Differences between species\/varieties \n \nData for einkorn, emmer and spelt grown under identical conditions (within each \nyear) at the John Innes Centre are shown in Table 3. In each year spelt had the highest \n\uf06413C values, between 2.1 and 3.4\u2030 higher than those of einkorn. In some years emmer \nhad \uf06413C values 1.0 to 1.4\u2030 higher than those of einkorn, in other years there was little \ndifference between emmer and einkorn. Differences in \uf06413C are also evident between \ndurum and einkorn grown at Agios Mamas, with einkorn having the higher values (Fig. \n4). \nWhilst these patterns are observed in comparisons of different species, variations \nin \uf06413C might equally be anticipated among different varieties of the same species. \nThus, whilst we observed no clear distinction between the Cosmodor and Simeto \nvarieties of durum wheat grown near Assiros in 1998 (Fig. 5), detailed trials of durum \ngenotypes grown under Mediterranean conditions have been found to yield grain \uf06413C \nvalues differing by up to 3.4\u2030 between different genotypes (Merah et al., 2001). The \ndifferences between species described above may therefore not be consistent, but could \nequally well be accounted for by chance differences due to the varieties sampled. \n \n \n3.4. Effect of charring on \uf06413C values \n \nThe effects of charring are shown in Figure 6, where it is apparent that the \ndifferent durations (3 or 5 days) or conditions (open versus closed) of charring had little \ninfluence; the main differences being observed between the two sources of einkorn. For \nthe Greek sample (Fig. 6a), charring resulted in a slight reduction in C\/N ratios, but little \noverall change in \uf06413C values. In contrast, charring of the French einkorn (Fig. 6b), \nwhich started with a much higher C\/N ratio, resulted in a more marked reduction in C\/N \nratio and an increase in \uf06413C values of about 0.8\u2030. \nAn increase in \uf06413C values could result from the preferential loss of lipids, which \ntend to have \uf06413C values lower than other components (Lichtfouse et al., 1995). As \nlipids contain little nitrogen, their preferential loss should result in a decrease in C\/N \nratio, as is observed in Fig. 6, and is also evident in the data reported by Aguilera et al. \n(2008). 15N\/14N ratios of einkorn appear to be little affected by charring (Bogaard et al., \n2007). \nPrevious experiments on the effect of charring on the \uf06413C values of wheat grain \nwere carried out at higher temperatures and over shorter durations than those used in \nthis study. Carbonisation of grains of durum wheat, at temperatures reaching 400oC or \n600oC for up to 2 hours, resulted in \uf06413C values increasing by up to about 1\u2030 (Araus \nand Buxo, 1993; Araus et al., 1997), whereas bread wheat carbonised for short periods \nat 250oC showed negligible change in \uf06413C (Ferrio et al., 2007). Within the constraints \nof these experiments, the effect of charring on the \uf06413C values of wheat is generally \nignored (Araus et al., 2003; Ferrio et al., 2007). \n \n \n4. Assiros Toumba \n \n4.1. The identification of maslin  \n \n\uf06413C values for the Bronze Age wheat samples from Assiros Toumba are listed \nin Table 4. Each sample value represents the average of 5 grains. For those samples \nwhere the grains were analysed individually the average standard deviation was 0.45\u2030 \n(Table 4), which is similar to that found among single field harvests of modern wheat \ngrain (Table 1). \nThe distribution of \uf06413C values for samples of different species is displayed as \nhistograms in Fig. 7. It is clear that, whereas emmer and spelt were not distinguishable \nfrom one another, the mean value for einkorn is significantly lower than the means for \nemmer and spelt (Fig. 7). Whilst direct comparison between ancient and modern \nvarieties must be treated with caution, it is clear from the modern data (Table 3) that the \ndifferent species can exhibit large differences in \uf06413C even when grown under the same \nconditions, and so the difference in \uf06413C values between einkorn and the other wheat \nspecies at Assiros Toumba need not reflect different growing locations or years. \nIn most parts of the storeroom complex, emmer and spelt were found in \nassociation with one another, and it has been suggested that they were grown together as \na mixed crop, or \u2018maslin\u2019 (Jones, 1987). Although the mean \uf06413C values for emmer and \nspelt are very similar, there is a total range of about 1.5\u2030. A plot of the \uf06413C values of \npaired samples taken from the same containers demonstrates that the emmer and spelt \n\uf06413C values are well-correlated across this range (Fig. 8), the Spearman\u2019s Rank \nCorrelation Coefficient of 0.75 being significant at 99% confidence. This lends support \nto the interpretation of these samples as representing intentional emmer\/spelt maslins \nrather than unintended mixing of the two species during the destruction of the \nstorerooms or subsequent salvage efforts. The slight differences in the \uf06413C values of \nmaslin mixtures from different containers may be the result of each container holding \nwheat harvested from a different field. \n \n4.2. Spatial and temporal distribution of cultivation  \n \nThe \uf06413C data for the wheat at Assiros Toumba show no evidence for significant \ntemporal or spatial differences in harvests. The distributions of \uf06413C values for the three \nspecies appear to be normal (at least for the more abundant einkorn, Fig. 7), and the \nranges of values \u2013 1.2\u2030 (einkorn), 1.2\u2030 (emmer) and 1.4\u2030 (spelt) \u2013 are in fact very \nsimilar to the 1.3\u2030 range for modern durum wheat harvested in one year from farms \nclose to Assiros (Fig. 5). The narrowness of these ranges means that there is little \nevidence for any significant differences between the individual samples of a particular \nspecies. Thus it was noted above that samples would need to differ by at least 0.7\u2030 to \nbe considered significantly different at the 95% confidence level. For Assiros, 18 of the \n24 einkorn samples fall within this 0.7\u2030 range, and therefore have \uf06413C which are \nstatistically indistinguishable. In addition, no particular characteristics distinguished the \nsix remaining samples having the highest or lowest \uf06413C values. \nIn all respects the data are therefore consistent with the different samples of \nwheat at Assiros Toumba having been harvested in the same year and from a limited \ngeographic area. From our knowledge of variations among modern wheat harvests, \nhowever, we cannot absolutely preclude the possibility that the wheat in the Assiros \nToumba storerooms represents harvests from different years or locations which, \ncoincidentally, have identical \uf06413C values. \n \n4.3. Crop water status \n \nIn terms of absolute values, it is instructive to compare the composition of the \nBronze Age einkorn from Assiros Toumba with modern samples of the same species \nfrom the same area. Einkorn is no longer cultivated at Assiros, but we estimate that its \nhypothetical modern value would be about \u201322.4\u2030 on the basis that: \n \n(1) the average \uf06413C value for einkorn at Agios Mamas during 1991-1998 was \n-23.2\u2030; \n(2) the differences between the \uf06413C values of durum grown at Agios Mamas and at \nthe different farms around Assiros averaged 0.8\u2030 (in both 1995 and 1998). \n \nTo compare this modern value of -22.4\u2030 to the mean value of -23.5\u2030 for the Bronze \nAge einkorn (Fig. 7), we must take into account known historic changes in the isotopic \ncomposition of atmospheric CO2. This is done by expressing the wheat isotope \ncomposition relative to atmospheric CO2 using the value for discrimination, \uf044, where: \n \n\uf028 \uf02910001 13\n1313\nplant\nplantair\nplant C\nCC\n\uf064\n\uf064\uf064\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf044     (Farquhar et al., 1989) \n \nIf \uf06413Cair was \u20137.8\u2030 during the 1990s, and \u20136.5\u2030 in the Bronze Age (Indermuhle et al., \n1999), then \uf06413Ceinkorn values of  -22.4\u2030 and \u201323.5\u2030 for modern and Bronze Age \nwheat yield \uf044einkorn values of +14.9\u2030 and +17.4\u2030, respectively; i.e. a 2.5\u2030 higher \nvalue for the Bronze Age. \n Of the various factors influencing \uf044plant, the availability of water exerts one of \nthe strongest controls, and measurements of \uf044plant are widely used in assessing \u2018water \nuse efficiency\u2019 (amount of carbon assimilated per unit of water transpired; Farquhar et \nal., 1989). Higher values for \uf044plant can reflect, for example, greater water availability or \nlower water use efficiency. \nIt must be acknowledged that the 2.5\u2030 higher value for \uf044einkorn for Assiros \nToumba is based on samples which may only reflect the conditions of a single year. Our \ndata nevertheless show marked similarities to historic changes reported for wheat in \nother parts of the Mediterranean. Thus Araus and Buxo (1993) reported \uf044plant = +15.5\u2030 \nand +17.1\u2030 for modern and Bronze Age durum wheat from Catalonia, and Araus et al. \n(2007) reported \uf044plant values of approximately +14\u2030 and +17\u2030 for modern and \nNeolithic durum wheat from the middle Euphrates. These changes can be interpreted \nboth in terms of improvements in water use efficiency of modern varieties, or of \ncultivation under wetter conditions in the past (Araus and Buxo, 1993; Araus et al., \n2007). \nWetter conditions for the wheat at Assiros might reflect a moister climate in the \npast, or growth in soils which are naturally wetter (alluvial terraces near rivers), or \nirrigation. Information on climate conditions in the eastern Mediterranean during the \nBronze Age is equivocal with, as yet, no firm evidence for rainfall being substantially \ndifferent from the present (Eastwood et al., 2007). The possibility that the Assiros \ncereals had access to additional water during the grain filling period, however, is \nconsistent with earlier suggestions, on the basis of the crop weed flora, that cereals were \ncultivated under a garden regime (Jones, 1992), which probably entailed intensive \ntillage, and thus effective control of weeds that might otherwise have competed for \navailable moisture, and may also have included artificial watering. \n \n \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nWithin a single wheat field, changes in environmental conditions or plant \nphysiology during the filling of the grains produce natural variations in the \uf06413C values \nof individual grains of typically 0.5\u2030 (1 SD). The destructive nature of carbon isotope \nanalysis means that, for precious archaeological samples, only a few grains may be \navailable. Therefore, if the \uf06413C values of samples from different archaeological \ncontexts are to be regarded as significantly different based on analysis of, say five \ngrains in each set, the mean value of each set must differ by at least 0.7\u2030. Samples of \nsingle species of wheat from modern harvests in Greece, however, have shown that \nharvests from different fields in the same region, or harvests from the same fields in \ndifferent years, can sometimes have \uf06413C values differing by less than 0.7\u2030. In these \ncircumstances the spatial or temporal distinctions are not detectable. Larger, detectable \ndifferences between harvest locations or years probably require larger contrasts in \nclimate. \n The lack of significant differences between samples of einkorn from Bronze Age \nstorerooms at Assiros Toumba is therefore consistent with a single year\u2019s harvest \ngathered over a small area, but the possibility that the grain represents harvests of \ndifferent years, or from a wide area with little climatic variation, cannot be ruled out. \nOur study of modern crops near Assiros, however, suggests that whereas there is little \ndifference in \uf06413C values between locations within about 10 km, interannual variations \nover a ten year period are much larger. Thus, while it would be difficult to detect \ndifferences in \uf06413C due to the pooling of crops from the local area, those resulting from \nthe storage of crops grown over a period of several years should be detectable. We \ntherefore conclude that while the \uf06413C data are perfectly consistent with the pooling of \nlocal harvests in the Bronze Age storerooms, they are less likely to contain the harvest \nof several years or include grain imported from further afield. If the vast quantities of \ngrain stored at this site do represent a single year\u2019s harvest, this suggests communal \nstorage or mobilisation of grain by a ruling elite from the surrounding area \u2013 an \ninterpretation consistent with archaeological indications of quite localised settlement \nhierarchies at this time in northern Greece (Andreou 2001). \nThe correlation of emmer and spelt \uf06413C values provides strong evidence that \nthese two wheat species were grown together as a maslin crop at Assiros, as has \npreviously been argued on the basis of their co-occurrence in storage containers within \nthe storeroom complex. It further suggests that the contents of different containers were \nderived from different fields and so, since individual containers probably held a few \nhundred litres of spelt\/emmer maslin, opens the way to further tentative modelling of \nhow the stored grain was mobilised. For example, if the stored produce represented the \nwhole harvest, then individual fields are implied of a size that might be ploughed by a \npair of cattle in a day (say 0.1-0.3 ha). Alternatively, if the containers held a small \nfraction (e.g. a tithe [tenth]) of the harvest, this implies fields large enough to exceed the \ndaily ploughing capacity of a pair of powerful oxen. A weed flora compatible with \nintensive cultivation perhaps favours the former alternative. \n13C discrimination for einkorn grown in the Assiros region, \uf044einkorn, appears to \nhave decreased by about 2.5\u2030 between c. 1300 BC and modern times. It must be \naccepted that this is based on samples which may only represent a single year\u2019s harvest \n(i.e. might not be representative of \u2018average\u2019 conditions), and that a proper analysis of \nthe significance of this change would require information on the extent to which modern \nvarieties may have undergone genetic improvement in water use efficiency. In the \nabsence of this, however, we can make comparison with studies of durum, where a 3\u2030 \ndecrease in \uf044durum was interpreted to suggest that the \u2018total water inputs during grain \nfilling\u2019 for Neolithic durum in the Middle Euphrates were 2-3 times higher than the \nrainfall inputs of the same area today (Araus et al., 2007). If a similar interpretation \napplies to Bronze Age Assiros, and points to the watering of the cereal crops or control \nof weeds that might compete for soil moisture, it would be consistent with the \ninterpretation of the crop weed flora at Assiros, which indicates an intensive, \nhorticultural regime of cereal cultivation. \n \n Acknowledgements \n \nWe thank Stelios Samaras and Nikos Stavropoulos (Gene Bank, Agricultural Research \nCentre of Macedonia and Thrace, Greece) for provision of modern grain samples from \nThessaloniki and Agios Mamas, Apostolis Papafotiou for help in securing modern grain \nfrom the Assiros area, John Foulks (School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, \nUK) for donating material from whole wheat plants grown at Sutton Bonington, \nStephen Reader (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK) for providing different wheat species \nfrom the JIC Public Collection, and Richard Legge (Department of Archaeology, \nUniversity of Sheffield, UK) and Carol Arrowsmith (NERC Isotope Geosciences \nLaboratory, British Geological Survey, UK) for samples and analyses from the charring \nexperiments.
