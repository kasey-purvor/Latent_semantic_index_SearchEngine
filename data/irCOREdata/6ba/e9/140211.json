Consequently,\nthe need for senior executives to create and maintain competitive advantage for their firms is\ngreater than ever. Equally, in the provision of public services, politicians and the public are\nbecoming far more demanding regarding the quality and efficiency of services delivered.\nTherefore, there is little doubt that senior executives in the private and public sectors are\nunder significant pressure to continuously formulate the right organizational strategy,\nallowing the organization to deliver its objectives and meet stakeholders\u2019 expectations.\nTraditional text-book responses suggest that executives need to focus on developing\nstrategies that enable the organization to respond to changes in the external environment.\nThe debate on which basis organizations should develop their strategy continues unabated\n(see Porter (1980); Barney (1991)). We argue that the development of an appropriate\nstrategy is a necessary but in itself insufficient condition for a firm\u2019s on-going prosperity.\nWe assert that in order to achieve the objectives set, meet stakeholders\u2019 needs and maintain\nsustained prosperity a strategy must be translated into a coherent logic that coordinates the\n2myriad of activities, i.e. the actions, practices and routines, that take place in different parts of\nthe organization. This involves developing and implementing organizational structures,\nprocesses and relationships that support the strategy. Furthermore, it involves attracting,\nallocating and managing the necessary resources, for example, people, finance, information,\nknowledge and technology, which enable and support the strategy. In essence, senior\nexecutives are required to manage changes to the firm\u2019s organizational form, i.e. the overall\nlogic that shapes a firm\u2019s strategy, structure, processes and management routines into an\neffective whole (Miles et al. (1997)), where these are inappropriate for dealing effectively\nwith the forces and opportunities in the business environment.\nIn many organizations, the activities performed to create products and\/or services that are of\nvalue to one or more of the organization\u2019s stakeholders cross multiple functional,\norganizational and, increasingly, geographical boundaries. Consequently, organizational\nchanges span the people, processes, technological, departmental and geographical boundaries\nof the organization and are likely to touch a focal organization\u2019s suppliers, customers,\nstrategic partners and other third parties. Thus, initiatives that bring about changes to the\norganization\u2019s form are highly complex in nature.\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine organizational forms and their relationship with the\nmanagement of knowledge creation. Our interest in this conceptual area arises from the\nimplicit assumption in much of the extant literature that the same approach to the\nmanagement of knowledge creation can be utilized in the same manner in different\norganizational forms. We elucidate our argument by integrating, for the first time, the\nframeworks of Miles and Snow (1978) and Nonaka (1994). As we will discuss later, we\nselected these two frameworks because they have stood up to rigorous academic tests and\n3continue to be used widely (Alavi and Leidner (2001); Conant, Mokwa and Varadarajan\n(1990); Hambrick (1982, 2003); Sambamurthy and Subramani (2005); Zajac and Shortell\n(1989)). We framed our study to address the following research questions:\n\uf0b7 What generic organizational forms populate the business landscape and what are their\ncharacteristic features?\n\uf0b7 What are the modes of knowledge creation?\n\uf0b7 Which approach to knowledge management forms the best alignment with each\ngeneric organizational form?\n1.2 Deficiencies in the approaches for managing change initiatives\nScholars such as Beer and Nohria (2000) and Strebel (1996)) have pointed out that both\npublic and private sector organizations have a poor track record in successfully managing\ncomplex change initiatives. Empirical evidence suggests that more than 60% of change\ninitiatives fail to deliver the anticipated benefits (Kotter (1995); Strebel (1996)). The reasons\nthat underpin the failure of complex change initiatives are predominantly managerial rather\nthan technical in nature (Davenport, De Long and Beer (1998)). This suggests that the\nprocesses, methods and frameworks executives and consultants have traditionally utilised to\nmanage complex change initiatives may no longer be achieving the anticipated outcomes or\nmay be even creating additional problems elsewhere in the organization and value-creation\nchain (Williams and Parr (2004)). The literature and our experience with organizations in\nboth the private and public sectors lead us to believe that this is for two key reasons. First,\nactivities performed to deliver a valuable product or service cross many functional and other\nboundaries and hence, the requirements for and impacts of change initiatives affect most if\n4not the entire value-creation chain. Therefore, when functional or \u2018point\u2019 solutions are\nimplemented, i.e. following traditional approaches, they have unintended consequences in\nadjacent functional silos and beyond. Such affects are exacerbated when several of such\ninitiatives are being implemented simultaneously, as is typically the case in mid- and large-\nsized organizations which can have several concurrent major programmes that are made up of\nhundreds of projects and sub-projects. Second, many organizational forms are geared towards\nsupporting business in times of stability with a limited capability to respond to changes in the\nbusiness environment. Therefore, when the pace and scale of change increases, these\norganizational forms restrict the organization\u2019s ability to respond effectively (Miles and\nSnow (1978)).\n1.3 Succeeding with knowledge management initiatives\nWe argue that succeeding with complex organizational change initiatives requires the\nintegration of the tools, techniques, languages, frameworks and implementation methods of\nthe domains affected by these initiatives:\n\uf0b7 Change management\n\uf0b7 Knowledge management\n\uf0b7 Process management\n\uf0b7 Project management\nWe undertook an exploratory survey of the literature which suggested that very little trans-\ndisciplinary research has been conducted across these areas. Therefore, we carried out a\nrigorous and systematic meta-review of the literature (Tranfield, Denyer and Smart (2003)) to\n5gain a coherent understanding of the interplay between change, knowledge, process, and\nproject management in the context of complex organizational change initiatives. This meta-\nreview revealed, amongst other things, that there appears to be a third reason change\ninitiatives fail, in particular when these initiatives concern the implementation of knowledge\nmanagement strategies in organizations. Although the knowledge management literature\nrecognises that knowledge management strategies must follow competitive strategies for\ncompanies to develop sustainable competitive advantages through utilisation of their unique\nknowledge assets (Hansen, Nohria and Tierney (1999); Teece (2000)), it provides no\nframeworks for effectively aligning appropriate knowledge management models with\norganizations\u2019 strategies, structures and processes, i.e. organizational forms. Without such\nalignment frameworks, organizations risk adopting a knowledge management strategy which\nis inappropriate for their organizational form and, subsequently, fail to realise the anticipated\nbenefits of knowledge management (Davenport, De Long and Beers (1998); Hansen, Nohria\nand Tierney (1999)). Furthermore, the knowledge management strategies typically described\nin the literature are all very similar in nature, creating the perception that a standardised\nknowledge management approach with universal applicability exists (Davenport, De Long\nand Beers (1998); Paik and Choi (2005); Soo et al. (2002)). The validity of this perception is,\nhowever, arguable as it would imply that each organization operates and competes in the\nsame way. Reality and disciplines like strategic management and organizational theory\n(Miles and Snow (1978)) quickly provide empirical proof that this is not the case. Therefore,\nwe argue in this paper that a company\u2019s knowledge management initiatives, and specifically\nits approach to managing the creation of knowledge, must be closely aligned with its\norganizational form. We anticipate that this perspective will enable organizations to reap the\nanticipated benefits from knowledge management. We propose a framework which puts the\n6knowledge management models of Nonaka (1994) in context in relation to the strategic\ntypology of Miles and Snow (1978).\n1.3 Overview of paper\nOur paper is organised as follows. In the next section we will discuss the Miles and Snow\nstrategic typology and argue that each generic organizational form requires a different\napproach to the management of knowledge creation in order to develop and maintain a\nsustainable competitive advantage. In the third section we will discuss Nonaka\u2019s dynamic\ntheory of organizational knowledge creation and critically compare this with the static\nknowledge management approaches typically detailed in the literature for maintaining a\ncompetitive advantage in a continuously changing business environment. In the fourth section\nwe will combine the organizational design framework of Miles and Snow (1978) with the\nknowledge spiral of Nonaka (1994) and discuss the significance of selecting the appropriate\napproach for managing the creation of knowledge in a particular organizational form for\nachieving sustainable competitive advantage. We provide some conclusions from our\nanalysis and recommendations for further research.\n2 Miles and Snow\u2019s strategic typology\n2.1 The evolution of organizational forms\nMost organizations engage in a regular review of their core purpose, i.e. questioning,\nverifying and redefining the manner in which they interact with their environment (Miles and\nSnow (1978)). Effective organizations are those that excel at this market alignment task\n7whilst ineffective organizations are those that fail at identifying and maintaining a viable\nmarket for their product and\/or service offerings. Furthermore, most organizations engage in\nan on-going process of reviewing, modifying and refining the architecture of their structures\nof roles and responsibilities, business processes and systems in support of the organization\u2019s\nmarket strategy. Efficient organisations are capable of aligning their structures, processes and\nsystems with their market strategy, but inefficient organisations struggle with this alignment\ntask. Miles and Snow (1978) called this entire process the Adaptive Cycle, using the\norganization\u2019s dynamic management of its products and markets as the underlying\ndimension. In essence, this dynamic organizational process of adjusting internal\ninterdependencies to changes in the market environment is the driving force behind the\nevolution of the company\u2019s organizational form over time.\nAccording to Miles and Snow (1978), organizational adaptation is concerned with finding\ncomplementary sets of solutions to the following three interlinked problems:\n\uf0b7 The entrepreneurial problem\n\uf0b7 The operations problem, and\n\uf0b7 The business administration problem.\nThe entrepreneurial problem is about turning an innovative insight into a concrete definition\nof a product or service offering as well as the market or market segment at which this\noffering is targeted. The solution to this problem takes shape when management agrees on the\nchoice of market(s) it wants the company to compete in, its orientation towards the market,\ni.e. the desired market perception of the brand (e.g., low-cost leader, exclusivity, or\ninnovative product design), and decides to allocate scarce resources to the implementation of\n8its market strategy. Following the development of this solution, further entrepreneurial\nactivities will be concerned with monitoring events in the marketplace and management of\nthe company\u2019s product portfolio.\nWhen a solution for the entrepreneurial problem has been developed, the market strategy\nmust be implemented at the operational level. The operations problem is about turning the\nsolution for the entrepreneurial problem into a concrete business operation. This concerns not\nonly the design of appropriate business processes for transforming inputs into value-added\noutputs and distributing them to the target market but also the information, knowledge,\ncommunication and control infrastructures to ensure efficient operation of business processes.\nTo support the market strategy and business operations, solutions need to be found for the\nbusiness administration problem. The business administration problem is about creating a\nmanagement system that both supports the current market strategy and business operations as\nwell as sustains the company\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in the future. Therefore, this phase\nis concerned with the development of an administrative system, i.e. the organizational\nstructure, roles and responsibilities, and routines for both managing current activities\neffectively as well as ensuring that the organization maintains its ability to innovate.\nObviously, the solution to this problem will have significant consequences for the power\nbalances, culture and attitudes created within the organization, which can act both as enablers\nor barriers to change (Miles and Snow (1978)).\nThrough empirical research Miles and Snow recognized the existence of four generic or\n\u201cideal\u201d organizational forms, which they typified as Defenders, Prospectors, Analyzers and\nReactors (Miles and Snow (1978)). As will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections, each\n9of these types perceives the dynamics of the marketplace differently, relates to it in a unique\nway, and has a unique set of solutions for aligning its processes and structures with its market\nstrategy. Many scholars have confirmed, with further empirical data, over the past 30 years\n(e.g., Conant et al. (1990); Hambrick (1982, 2003); Parnell and Wright (1993)) that, firstly,\nDefender, Prospector and Analyzer organizations exist in many different industry sectors\nand, secondly, have economically viable organizational forms whereas Reactors do not due to\ntheir misalignments of market strategy, operations and administration. Furthermore, these\nscholars have confirmed that these types are not restricted to small-, medium- or large-sized\norganizations in the private sector but are also found in non-profit organizations (Miles and\nSnow (1978); Conant et al. (1990)).\n2.2 Defender\nDefenders are organizations that deliberately choose a narrow market domain for their limited\nportfolio of products and\/or services, thereby creating the conditions for a stable\norganizational form. Within this narrow domain Defenders defend their market position by\neither offering highly competitive priced products and\/or services or ones of superior quality.\nFurthermore, Defenders tend to perceive developments in their niche market as stable,\nthereby allowing them to disregard developments outside their market domain and direct\nmost of their efforts and investments towards improving their operational domain.\nConsequently, top managers in this type of organization tend to be highly expert in their\ndomain, enabling them to develop and continuously improve a highly cost-efficient business\nprocess. As a result, their set of solutions to the business administration problem is\ncharacterised by strict control and bureaucratic mechanisms in order to ensure sustained\nefficiency. Although this is an economically viable strategy in stable or predictable industries,\n10\nmajor shifts in their niche market can threaten the Defender organization\u2019s survival. Figure 1\nsummarizes these and other Defender characteristics.\nFigure 1\n2.3 Prospector\nProspector organizations are in many respects the polar opposite of Defender organizations;\nalthough both types have in common a consistent set of solutions to the three organizational\nadaptation problems. In contrast to Defenders, however, top management of Prospector\norganizations perceive their market environment as constantly changing. Therefore,\nProspectors either have or develop core capabilities of finding and exploiting new market\nopportunities by offering pioneering products and\/or services. Consequently, Prospectors are\nmore concerned with maintaining their innovator image in the marketplace than serving\nexisting markets as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, working as efficiently as\npossible is the Defenders\u2019 core capability. Prospectors tend to monitor a wide range of trends\nand events in the marketplace, enabling them to remain at the forefront of new product and\nmarket developments. Due to this entrepreneurial solution, the Prospector\u2019s solution to the\noperations problem is characterized by a high degree of flexibility in its business processes,\nwhich is achieved by low degrees of routinization, standardization and mechanisation, and a\nhighly knowledgeable and entrepreneurial workforce. Therefore, a Prospector\u2019s set of\nsolutions to the business administration problem is characterised by a self-organizing\nstructure, creative, culturally diverse, and supportive work environment, availability and\naccess to resources necessary for new product development, and a reward system that favours\nR&D and marketing. These and other Prospector characteristics are summarized in Figure 2.\n11\nFigure 2\n2.4 Analyzer\nAs is evident from the preceding two sections, Defender and Prospector organizations can be\npositioned at the extreme ends of a continuum of economically viable and sustainable\nbusiness strategies. Organizations that reside in the middle of this continuum are a hybrid\nform of Defender and Prospector organizations and are called Analyzers in the Miles and\nSnow typology. By combining the strengths of the Defender, carving out and defending a\nniche in the market, with those of the Prospector, locating and exploiting new product and\nmarket opportunities, Analyzers attempt to minimize risk and maximize the opportunity for\nprofit. However, in contrast to Prospectors, Analyzers tend to be more cautious and selective\nin their approach to entering new markets with pioneering products; Analyzers typically\nfollow a \u201csecond to market but better\u201d approach. The dual market focus of the Analyzer, a\nstable portfolio of products for efficiently serving existing markets and a changing portfolio\nof new products for new markets, makes this strategy potentially difficult to implement due\nto the opposing operational and administrative requirements. Miles and Snow (1978) argued\nthat these problems could be solved by adopting a matrix structure combined with a blend of\nDefender and Prospector characteristics (see Figure 3). However, as evidenced by practice\nand scholars (see e.g., Benner and Tushman (2003); O\u2019Reilly and Tushman (2004); Tushman\nand O\u2019Reilly (1996)) managing and initiating change within matrix organizations is complex,\nin particular due to the inertia inherent in the Defender characteristics of the organization.\nTherefore, practitioners and scholars have been experimenting with different organizational\nforms to find more suitable ways in which companies can succeed with both protecting their\n12\ntraditional business and developing innovative products and markets. For example, O\u2019Reilly\nand Tushman (2004) describe how companies experimented with cross-functional teams as\nwell as those who utilized entrepreneurial teams that operated outside the established\norganization and management hierarchy. According to their research, organizations adopting\nthese practices typically failed to achieve their goals whereas companies that opted for\ncreating two structurally independent business units, each having its own business processes,\norganizational structures, culture and management systems typically succeeded in their\nattempts to effectively manage evolutionary and revolutionary change.\nFigure 3\n2.5 Reactor\nDefenders, Analyzers and Prospectors all perceive change in their business environment\ndifferently and, therefore, have distinctly different organizational forms to effectively interact\nwith and adapt to their environments. In spite of these differences, these three types have a\nconsistent set of solutions to the entrepreneurial, operations, and business administration\nproblems in common, which makes their activities economically viable. Events, however, can\naffect these response mechanisms, making them inconsistent and unstable, thereby\nthreatening the organization\u2019s performance and, ultimately, its survival. For example, top\nmanagement might fail to properly convey the organization\u2019s strategy to its employees,\nleading to inappropriate organizational change initiatives or inaction; management might\ndevelop an unsuitable structure and processes to fit the market strategy; or, management\nmight hold on too long to the current organizational form whilst there is overwhelming\nevidence that major changes are taking place in the business environment. In these and other\n13\ncases that lead to inappropriate responses to environmental change, poor performance, or\nwhere there is a reluctance to change, the organization evolves into a Reactor. The Reactor\nstrategy is, as Miles and Snow (1978) state, a \u201cresidual\u201d strategy that arises when Defender,\nAnalyzer or Prospector strategies are improperly implemented.\n3 Nonaka\u2019s models for managing knowledge creation\n3.1 Organizational creation of knowledge\nKnowledge, and in particular the creation of knowledge, plays an increasingly important role\nin sustaining the competitive advantage of organizations in the new economy (see e.g.,\nBirkinshaw and Sheehan (2002); Davenport et al. (1998); Hansen et al. (1999); Miles et al.\n(1997); Teece (2000)) and, consequently, their effective management. Before the latter can be\naddressed, however, it is paramount to have a profound understanding of how knowledge is\ncreated within an organizational context and the essential conditions for this process to take\nplace.\nNonaka (1988) argues that at the level of the individual autonomy, i.e. the freedom to\ncombine thinking and action at one\u2019s own discretion, is the critical condition necessary for\ninitiating the process of information creation. Given a sufficient degree of autonomy, the\nindividual is able to combine a wide range of observations in the external environment with\nextant knowledge and experiences, recognize the new and unknown, and develop innovative\ninsights. The knowledge that underpins this information creation process is what Polanyi\n(1966) calls tacit knowledge; knowledge that is difficult to formalize and communicate, and\nwhich is deeply rooted in action, commitment, and involvement in a specific context. Nonaka\n14\n(1994) expands this philosophical concept in a more practical direction by including \u201cmental\nmodels\u201d such as schemata, paradigms, beliefs, and viewpoints that provide different\nperspectives for perceiving and defining the world. Although mental models can be\narticulated, they can not be exchanged with the same ease as codified knowledge; knowledge\nthat can be expressed in a formal, systematic language and encoded in media such as\ndocuments, manuals, standard operating procedures, and blueprints.\nThe next phase of knowledge creation concerns the transformation of the individual\u2019s\ninnovative insights, tacit knowledge, into a new point of view shared by others, new tacit\nknowledge, in order to start the process of realizing the insight. Nonaka (1994) calls such\nprocesses knowledge conversions, which at this stage best takes place at group level through\nsocialization (see Figure 4). Nonaka (1988) argues that, therefore, a further critical condition\nfor enabling organizational knowledge creation is the opportunity for human interaction.\nGiven this opportunity, the individual shares his or her insight with others through dialogue,\nthereby acquiring other individuals\u2019 tacit knowledge. However, the latter will only occur if\nthe members of this group share each others\u2019 thinking processes due to shared experiences.\nWithout this, new information presented will not make sense and, therefore, will not be\nabsorbed.\nFigure 4\nTo further realize the innovative insight, now shared by a group of people, tacit knowledge\nmust be converted into explicit knowledge to enable the allocation of resources for its\nexecution. Nonaka (1994) refers to this mode of knowledge conversion as externalization. He\n15\nargues that metaphors play a key role in this process as they enable people to understand and\nexperience one kind of thing in terms of another.\nIn the next phase of the organizational knowledge creation process, the output of the\nexternalization phase at group level must be transmitted to other groups in the organization,\ni.e. the process now moves to the organizational level. For example, if the individual\u2019s insight\nconcerns the concept for a new car model, then the output from the externalization phase\ncould be the car\u2019s specifications, which groups such as \u201cproduction\u201d, \u201cmarketing\u201d, etc. would\nneed to further realize the entrepreneurial insight. This third mode of knowledge conversion,\nfrom explicit knowledge to new explicit knowledge, is what Nonaka (1994) calls\ncombination; the combining of different bodies of explicit knowledge held by individuals.\nThis conversion process typically takes place through social exchange processes such as\nmeetings and conversations. The critical condition here is the organization\u2019s structure, which\nregulates the relationships between the various groups or sections involved in the knowledge\ncreation process, thus the exchange of information between these groups and, therefore, the\nallocation of resources. For this reason, the organizational structure has a significant\ninfluence on an organization\u2019s ability to respond to changes in the external environment and\nto innovate. We will come back to this issue in section 4.\nThe fourth mode of knowledge conversion is about converting explicit knowledge into new\ntacit knowledge, which Nonaka (1994) calls internalization, and which is similar in nature to\n\u201clearning\u201d. This phase can take place at both the individual level and the intra-organizational\nlevel.\n16\nWhat characterizes the process of organizational knowledge creation described above is,\nfirstly, the continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge and, secondly, the\ndynamic interaction between the different modes of knowledge conversion. If this process\nwere represented graphically, it would look like a spiral: Nonaka\u2019s spiral of knowledge (see\nFigure 5). Figure 5 shows this dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge at the level of\nthe individual (the entrepreneur), the social processes necessary to raise the level of this\ndialogue to that of the group, the organization and inter-organization, and back to the level of\nthe individual (the performer).\nFigure 5\n3.2 Nonaka\u2019s knowledge management models\nThe entrepreneurial individual described in the previous section can, in principle, be located\nthroughout the organization. For example, this individual can be a member of the\norganization\u2019s top management team as well as of its lower management. This, however,\ndoes not imply that each and every individual in each and every organization can participate\nin this knowledge creation process, an impression created by many scholars by describing a\n\u201cuniversal\u201d approach to knowledge management (Davenport et al. (1998); Hansen et al.\n(1999); Soo et al. (2002)); Teece (2000)). Nonaka (1988; 1994) identifies three different\ntypes of organizations, namely those where new knowledge is only created at the top, those\nwhere new knowledge can be created by any individual, and those where middle management\nis responsible for creating new knowledge. Given the requisite enabling conditions for\ncreating new knowledge, these locations of knowledge creation have profound consequences\nfor the form of management that promotes the efficient creation of knowledge in these\n17\ncontexts, i.e. each context requires a different management style. Nonaka (1994) calls these\nmanagement styles Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and Middle-Up-Down, respectively.\nIn the Top-Down management model, top managers are the only members of the organization\nthat have the autonomy to deliberate and experiment with relating facts and extant knowledge\nand the freedom to act on entrepreneurial insights by sharing them in open and frank dialogue\nat group level. The outcomes of this process are top management\u2019s concepts (e.g., an idea for\na new product or service), broken down in strategic objectives and the allocation of resources\nso that these concepts can be implemented by subordinates. Of paramount concern here is\nthat implementation at lower levels of the organization occurs as intended by top\nmanagement. This is achieved by top management through their design of a functional\norganizational structure with extensive division of labour, a high degree of formalization,\nlong-looped information systems, and centralized control. Therefore, in the Top-Down model\ninformation processing is concerned with transforming general information into increasingly\nspecific information: top managers\u2019 concepts become middle managers\u2019 operational\nconditions (e.g., the specifications of the new product or service), middle managers decide on\nhow to realize these concepts, and decisions by middle managers become lower\nmanagement\u2019s operational conditions for implementing the concepts. Furthermore, as a\nconsequence of this structure and management system, individuals at lower levels in the\norganization are never in a position to obtain a broad and diverse perspective of the business\nand the environment it operates in and, thus, to develop and transmit entrepreneurial insights\n(Nonaka (1988)). Consequently, any of their innovative insights will be restricted to their\noperational area and only make it up the organization slowly due to a bureaucratic system\nthat is designed to filter and process information downwards. Therefore, the organization is\nconstrained in its ability to draw on its employees entrepreneurial capabilities, thereby\n18\nmaking the organization dependent on the capabilities of its top management, which Nonaka\n(1994) indicates as a weakness of this model.\nThe Bottom-Up management model is the opposite of the Top-Down model. In this model it\nis not top management that has the sole prerogative to create new knowledge. On the\ncontrary, in this model lower and middle managers are responsible for the creation of\nknowledge. Pinchot (1985) calls these employees who function as intra-company\nentrepreneurs intrapreneurs. To enable knowledge creation within this context, individuals at\nany organizational level are given the freedom to deliberate, experiment, and create\nmeaningful information through intense interactions with others. Information technology\nplays a key role in this process as it allows individuals to find and communicate with others\nin different locations. Furthermore, in this model, top managers take on the role of supportive\nleaders and utilize the company\u2019s vision and values to select and sponsor promising ideas\ndeveloped and defined by individuals or self-organized groups. Their sponsorship enables the\nsubsequent allocation of the necessary resources and protects the concept\u2019s implementation\nagainst any opposition from within the organization. In contrast to the Top-Down model, this\nresults in an organization characterized by a product instead of a process focus, a low division\nof labour, low degrees of formalization, decentralized control, and short-looped horizontal\ninformation systems. As Nonaka (1994) argues, the weaknesses of this model are that, firstly,\nknowledge creation is more time-consuming due to the greater level of interactions between\nmore individuals, and, secondly, the difficulty of coordinating individuals due to the self-\norganizing principle employed to tap a greater pool of creative thinking. Consequently,\nresources may be under-utilized or even misused.\n19\nNonaka\u2019s Middle-Up-Down management model is a synthesis of his Top-Down and Bottom-\nUp models and is an attempt to make the process of knowledge creation more efficient in\norder to keep pace with the intensity of today\u2019s market competition (Nonaka (1988; 1994)).\nIn this knowledge management model, the core of knowledge creation is located with middle\nmanagers as they are able to combine the strategic concepts of top managers with the hands-\non information required by lower managers. Therefore, top management\u2019s role is determining\nthe overall direction of the organization and establishing the timeframe within which their\nvision must be realized. This vision, however, is created in dialogue with middle managers\nselected by the top, who in turn draw on the combination of individual visions of lower-level\npersonnel for their own input. Before these selected middle managers can realize this vision,\nutilizing the resources allocated through their interactions with top management, they have to\nconfront and resolve the criticisms of other middle managers through intensive\ncommunications. During this stage the vision will evolve into a more concrete concept, which\nat lower levels of the organization is further refined and implemented by multi-disciplinary,\nself-organizing teams, headed by middle managers, within the limited timeframe given by top\nmanagement. Consequently, organizations that adopt this knowledge management model can\nbe characterized by a loose matrix structure combining functional and product groups,\nmoderate centralized control with both horizontal and vertical feedback loops, and an\nextremely complex and expensive coordination mechanism, which Nonaka (1994) regards as\nits weakness. Furthermore, the fact that it places great pressure on the entrepreneurial\ncapabilities of middle managers is something Nonaka (1988) regards as an additional\nweakness of this model.\n3.3 The relationship between environmental characteristics and organizational\nknowledge creation models\n20\nNonaka (1988) argues, that the choice of knowledge management model, Top-Down, Bottom-\nUp, or Middle-Up-Down, cannot be arbitrary but must be appropriately aligned with the level\nof uncertainty in the external environment. He argues that, when the level of uncertainty is\nlow, the organization can adapt itself effectively by maintaining a low level of knowledge\ncreation, i.e. a small group of individuals that are responsible for creating new knowledge.\nAccording to Nonaka (1988), in these situations the Top-Down model is an appropriate\nchoice. On the other hand, when the level of uncertainty is great, the intensity of\norganizational knowledge creation must be at an accordingly high level to adapt effectively,\ni.e. individuals at all levels of the organization must be involved in this creative process.\nTherefore, Nonaka (1988) argues, that the Bottom-Up management model is an appropriate\nchoice for such contexts. When the organization, on the other hand, is faced by uncertainty\ndue to intense competition and the ability to respond rapidly is essential, Nonaka (1988)\nargues that the Middle-Up-Down management model is an appropriate choice.\n4 Aligning knowledge management models with organizational\nstrategic types\n4.1 Integrating organizational forms and knowledge management models\nIn this section of the paper we bring together, for the first time, Miles and Snow\u2019s\norganizational form framework and Nonaka\u2019s knowledge creation spiral and management\nmodels. Our aim is to examine knowledge creation (Figure 6) under the conditions of each\norganizational form. Specifically, we aim in this section to address our third research\n21\nquestion: \u201cWhich approach to knowledge management forms the best alignment with each\ngeneric organizational form?\u201d\nFigure 6\n4.2 The Defender organizational form and Top-Down knowledge management\nAs stated earlier, top managers of Defender organizations tend to perceive developments in\ntheir niche market as stable, thereby allowing them to disregard developments outside their\nmarket domain and direct most of their efforts and investments towards improving their\noperational domain. Defender organizations achieve this through a hierarchical organizational\nstructure with extensive division of labour, a high degree of formalization, centralized\ncontrol, and a reward system that favours production and finance. This enables these\norganizations to maintain their market image of low-cost leader or provider of superior\nquality offerings. We argue that these strategic and organizational behavioural choices have\nsignificant consequences for knowledge creation in these organizations and, therefore, the\napproach to knowledge management. As indicated in Figure 7, in Defender organizations\nsenior managers set out the organization\u2019s strategic direction, create new product concepts,\ndevelop the specifications for these product concepts, and allocate the resources for their\nrealization as well as continuous improvement of business processes (Miles and Snow\n(1978)). Therefore, we argue that knowledge starts as a coherent whole at the top of this\norganizational form and then gets driven down the functional silos. At each subsequent layer\nof the hierarchy, new process-oriented knowledge is created by middle managers, going\nthrough knowledge spirals separately from those in other silos, to achieve the strategic\nobjectives set by the top team. We argue that as a consequence knowledge becomes highly\n22\ndiffused at lower management levels with each functional and departmental community\ncreating its own knowledge in isolation of others (Brown and Duguid (1991)). The challenge\nfor Defender-type organizations is, therefore, ensuring that the communities of experts going\nthrough these isolated knowledge spirals create complementary knowledge outputs. We argue\nthat the unifying force for these knowledge creations derives from the clarity of the strategic\ndirectives. The approach to knowledge management that fulfils these requirements best is\nNonaka\u2019s Top-Down model. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: The effective management of knowledge creation within Defender\norganizational forms is achieved by adopting a Top-Down knowledge management\nframework.\nFigure 7\n4.3 The Prospector organizational form and Bottom-Up knowledge management\nProspector organizations perceive their market environment as constantly changing and\nutilize this context for developing a competitive advantage by pioneering products and\nmarkets. Prospectors achieve this by creating a high degree of flexibility in their business\noperations, and a flat organizational structure with a diverse and entrepreneurial workforce at\nthe lower management level. This organization form provides people with access to\ninformation and other resources to gain insights into market developments and customer\nneeds and develop these into novel concepts for developing new products or entering new\nmarkets. This enables these organizations to remain at the forefront of product and market\ndevelopments and to maintain their market image as creators of change. As for Defender\n23\norganizations, we argue that these strategic and organizational behavioural choices have\nsignificant consequences for knowledge creation in these organizations and, therefore, the\napproach to knowledge management. Knowledge creation in Prospector organizations can\ntake place at any level but is most prevalent at the lower levels of management, as\nrepresented in Figure 8. Therefore, we argue that in this organizational form knowledge\ncreation is diffused from the very start, i.e. there is no central or senior management team that\nhas a coherent view of the organization\u2019s knowledge capital. Furthermore, porous functional\nand departmental boundaries allow diffused ideas to be shared, fostered, and developed by\nboth individuals and teams. The knowledge created at this level flows upward through the\norganization and is ratified by middle managers using top management\u2019s strategic vision and\norganizational values as guides. This organizational ability to combine fragments of\nknowledge that start life in different communities into an integrated whole is a key\nProspector strength and of vital strategic importance (Kogut and Zander (1992)). The\nchallenge for Prospector organizations is, therefore, ensuring that good ideas are not being\nstifled as they progress upward through the organization. The latter might happen when new\nideas proposed to potential sponsors are similar to ones that failed in the past, thereby\nrepresenting a possible risk for damaging a manager\u2019s reputation and remuneration prospects.\nThe approach to knowledge management that addresses these issues best is Nonaka\u2019s Bottom-\nUp model. Therefore:\nHypothesis 2: The effective management of knowledge creation within Prospector\norganizational forms is achieved by adopting a Bottom-Up knowledge management model.\nFigure 8\n24\n4.4 The Analyzer organizational form and Middle-Up-Down knowledge management\nAnalyzer organizations are a hybrid of the Defender and Prospector organizational forms\n(Miles and Snow (1978); O\u2019Reilly and Tushman (2004); Tushman and O\u2019Reilly (1996)) and,\ntherefore, perceive developments in their market environment as uncertain due to intense\ncompetition from all market directions. To prosper in this environment, Analyzer\norganizations focus their attention on developing competitive responses to market offerings\nby other Analyzers as well as Defender- and Prospector-type organizations in their industry\nsector. With regard to the latter, however, these organizations adopt a \u201csecond to market but\nbetter\u201d approach to reduce their exposure to market risks. Analyzer organizations achieve this\nmarket orientation by adopting loose matrix organizational structures in which multi-\ndisciplinary project teams concerned with developing new products for new markets interact\nwith functional groups tasked with continuously improving the production of existing\nproducts for currently served markets (Chesborough and Teece (1996); Dougherty (1992)).\nManaging these organizational processes effectively is complex, in particular with regard to\nthe creation of knowledge. As indicated in Figure 9, we argue that in Analyzer organizations\nknowledge can be created at any level of the organization but is most prevalent at middle\nmanagement level. In contrast to Prospector organizations, knowledge creation is diffused to\na lesser extent from the start as it is predominantly created by a group of middle managers\nselected and directed by top management. The knowledge created by these middle managers\nflows upwards through the organization and when ratified by top management gets driven\ndown and across the organization. At lower organizational levels this results in several multi-\ndisciplinary project teams going through separate knowledge spirals that may overlap where\ncommonalities exist between concurrent developments. We therefore argue that one of the\nchallenges for these organizations is ensuring that existing and newly developed knowledge\n25\nis made widely available and accessible to prevent extant knowledge from being re-invented\nelsewhere in the organization. Another challenge for these organizations is preventing good\nideas from being stifled, attacked, or hijacked as they progress through the organization due\nto politics and power plays between middle managers. The approach to knowledge\nmanagement that is likely to be most suitable for dealing with these issues is Nonaka\u2019s\nMiddle-Up-Down model. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3: The effective management of knowledge creation within Analyzer\norganizational forms is achieved by adopting a Middle-Up-Down knowledge management\nmodel.\nFigure 9\n5 Conclusions and further research\nMiles and Snow\u2019s framework has stood up to rigorous academic testing for over thirty years.\nFurthermore, in addition to Miles and Snow, many scholars (e.g., Conant et al. (1990);\nDeSarbo et al (2005); Hambrick (1982, 2003); Zajac and Shortell (1989)) have empirically\nestablished that Defender, Analyzer, and Prospector type organizations can be found in many\ndifferent industry sectors, and across different continents. Therefore, evidence is widely\navailable for confirming that, within a particular industry sector, organizations do perceive\ntheir business environment differently and, therefore, interact differently with it.\nConsequently, they organize, manage, and adapt themselves in different manners. However,\nthere are only a handful of economically viable ways in which this can be done. Miles and\nSnow (1978) were one of the first scholars to recognize this and characterized these\n26\norganizational forms in a holistic manner. We have expanded on this body of work by\nintegrating the Miles and Snow framework with the knowledge management models of\nNonaka. We have contributed to the academic debate on knowledge management by\nintegrating these two frameworks to question an assumption that pervades the literature; that\nthere is a single approach to managing the creation of knowledge. Instead, we have argued\nthat the approach to organizational knowledge management cannot be an unqualified choice\nbut must be closely aligned with the organizational form in order to be effective. By\nestablishing this integration we have challenged the implicit assumption that a universal\napproach exists and arrived at a conceptual framework in which knowledge management\nmodels are closely aligned with the requirements of generic organizational forms. We\nanticipate that this perspective will enable organizations to reap the anticipated benefits from\nknowledge management.\nOur paper also opens new vistas for further research. First, there is a need to undertake\nempirical research to test the models and hypotheses we propose. We suggest that this could\nbe achieved by carrying out a large-scale survey among managers responsible for strategy\nand knowledge management in organizations. Second, we anticipate that the ways in which\nthe knowledge spiral is operationalized in organizations will vary in each generic form. We\nbelieve that factors such as culture, leadership and information systems will shape the modes\nof managing the knowledge spiral. These factors can be best examined by way of in-depth\ncase studies in organizations that have the characteristics of the different forms. We anticipate\nthat the outcomes of these studies will lead to the development of better processes, methods,\nand frameworks for designing and implementing knowledge management initiatives. These\ndevelopments will enable more organizations to reap the benefits from knowledge\nmanagement and enhance their competitive edge.\n27\nReferences\nAlavi, M. & Leidner, D.E. 2001, \u201cReview: Knowledge management and knowledge\nmanagement systems: conceptual foundations and research issues\u201d, MIS Quarterly, vol. 25,\nno. 1, pp. 107-136.\nBarney, J.B. 1991, \u201cFirm resources and sustained competitive advantage\u201d, Journal of\nManagement, vol. 17, no. 1, pp. 99-120.\nBeer, M. & Nohria, N. 2000, \u201cCracking the code of change\u201d, Harvard Business Review, vol.\n78, no. 3, pp. 133-141.\nBenner, M.J. & Tushman, M.L. 2003, \u201cExploitation, exploration and process management:\nthe productivity dilemma revisited\u201d, Academy of Management Review, vol. 28, no. 2, pp.\n238-256.\nBirkinshaw, J. & Sheehan, T. 2002, \u201cManaging the knowledge life cycle\u201d, Sloan\nManagement Review, vol. 44, no. 1, pp. 75-84.\nBrown, J.
