A National\nAudit Office report (2005) highlighted the high cost of\nstroke to the NHS: about \u00a32.8 billion per year in direct\ncare costs, and an additional \u00a31.8 billion per year cost to\nthe wider economy due to lost productivity and disabil-\nity [2]. Recent estimates suggest that between 30-45% of\nstrokes are recurrent events, [3] so more effective sec-\nondary prevention could result in significant savings: the\nNational Audit Office estimates that preventing just 2%\nof strokes in England in a year could save care costs of\nover \u00a337 million [2]. NICE has identified better control\nof hypertension as one of the interventions that are cost\nsaving for the NHS [4].\nThe PROGRESS trial demonstrated that blood pres-\nsure lowering is beneficial in reducing risk of stroke\namongst both hypertensive and non-hypertensive indivi-\nduals with a history of stroke or TIA recruited in sec-\nondary care immediately after their cerebrovascular\nevent. In this trial, patients were randomised to either a\ncombination of an ACE inhibitor and thiazide diuretic\nagainst double placebo, or an ACE inhibitor alone\nagainst single placebo. The decision to randomise to\none or two agents was made by the supervising physi-\ncian on the basis of whether or not they thought it was\nsafe to randomise an individual patient to two agents.\nMean blood pressure in the intervention arm was\nreduced from 147 mmHg systolic by 9 mmHg (SE 0.3),\nand this was associated with a 28% reduction in stroke\nrisk [5]. The positive result of the PROGRESS trial\nraises a supplementary question: by how much should\nblood pressure be lowered? No randomised trials have\nspecifically compared different target blood pressures\n(BP) in the post-stroke\/TIA population. Observational\ndata (although not collected specifically in people with a\nhistory of stroke or TIA) suggest that the lower the\nblood pressure, the lower the risk of vascular mortality,\nat least down to 115 mmHg systolic [6,7]. There is\nsome evidence from PROGRESS to support this, in that\nthe sub-group of patients whose baseline BP was\nbetween 120 and 140 mmHg who were randomised to\ncombination therapy had a significantly reduced risk of\nstroke compared with control, though this benefit was\nnot observed in patients who were randomised to a sin-\ngle agent [8]. Guidelines have tended to interpret this\nevidence by recommending a target of 130 mmHg for\nsystolic blood pressure in people with cerebrovascular\ndisease [9,10]. However, the question remains whether\nsuch a target is prudent in general (42% were rando-\nmised to a single agent and gained no benefit) and\nwhether it is achievable in primary care (PROGRESS\nwas secondary care based) [5].\nLong term management of blood pressure following\nstroke and TIA is predominantly carried out in primary\ncare. Recent studies of blood pressure control in this\nsetting paint a mixed picture of implementation of\nguidelines. In a study of seven general practices in\nSouth Birmingham in 2002, 63% of patients with a pre-\nvious stroke or TIA had BP above the 140 mmHg tar-\nget, and 80% above the 130 mmHg target [11]. 68% of\nthese patients were prescribed BP lowering therapy. An\nanalysis of general practice data on the QRESEARCH\ndatabase for 2002-2004 found that of all patients with\nincident stroke, blood pressure was not recorded in 25%\nof patients, and where it was recorded, it was above the\n140 mmHg target in 47% [12]. An analysis of the impact\nof the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) carried out\nfor the National Audit Office found that the proportion\nof people with a history of stroke or TIA who had their\nBP measured in the preceding 15 months rose from\n89% to 95% between 2004 and 2005, and the proportion\nwith a BP below 150 mmHg (the target level for the\nQOF) rose from 69% to 80% suggesting some improve-\nment [13]. An analysis of the care of over three thou-\nsand patients who had a TIA during 2004-5 found that\n60% had a BP equal to or below the 140 mmHg target,\nthough only 50% were on any blood pressure lowering\ntherapy [14].\nIn summary, although there is some evidence that\nblood pressure lowering in people who have had a\nstroke or TIA is beneficial, there is no clear guidance on\nwhat the target BP should be. Furthermore, data col-\nlected from primary care suggest that guidelines from\nthe British Hypertension Society and Intercollegiate\nStroke Working Party are not being fully implemented.\nThis research is designed to support implementation of\nthe guidelines by both addressing the gaps in the under-\nlying evidence base, and testing a specific mechanism\nfor implementation of blood pressure lowering.\nMethods\/Design\nStudy aims\nThe primary aim of Past BP is to determine whether a\nmore intensive target BP for people with stroke or TIA in\na pragmatic primary care setting will lead to a lower BP.\nSecondary aims of the research are to:\n\u2022 determine the impact of a more intensive BP target\non patient quality of life;\n\u2022 identify the barriers to implementation of more\nintensive blood pressure lowering;\n\u2022 to explore whether the potential benefits associated\nwith intensive blood pressure lowering might be out-\nweighed by potential adverse effects on quality of life\nand costs.\nFletcher et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2010, 10:37\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2261\/10\/37\nPage 2 of 8\nThe latter point will be explored by economic model-\nling. If there is uncertainty as to whether there is net\nbenefit from intensive blood pressure lowering, then\nthere would be a case for a trial of different targets for\nBP lowering in primary care that is powered to detect\ndifferences in clinical end-points.\nThe study will also investigate patients\u2019 understanding\nand beliefs about the relationship between blood pres-\nsure and stroke, and patients and healthcare profes-\nsionals experience of participating in the study, which\nmay contribute to the success or otherwise of the\nintervention.\nStudy design and setting\nPast BP is a primary care based pragmatic randomised\ncontrolled trial (RCT) in which people with stroke or\nTIA are randomised to an intensive blood pressure (BP)\ntarget group (target 130 mmHg systolic, or 10 mmHg\nreduction in systolic BP if baseline BP 125 - 140\nmmHg) or a standard BP target group (target 140\nmmHg systolic).\nWe will also use qualitative methodologies to investi-\ngate patient and healthcare professionals understanding\nand views of BP management. Grounded theory meth-\nods will guide sampling, data collection and data analy-\nsis [15,16]. Sampling will be done purposively to allow\nfor the maximum variety of characteristics. Semi-struc-\ntured interviews will be carried out [17] and will con-\ntinue until new concepts are no longer being generated\nand theoretical saturation is reached.\nEthical Considerations\nFull ethical approval for this study has been obtained\nfrom Warwickshire Research Ethics Committee, refer-\nence 08\/H1211\/121. A Data Monitoring Committee and\na Trial Steering Committee will monitor the progress of\nthe RCT.\nRandomised controlled trial\nStudy Interventions\nManagement of both treatment groups will follow study\nspecific treatment protocols that reflect the current\nNICE guidelines [18]. However, the thresholds for inter-\nvention between the two treatment groups are different:\nall patients in the intensive target arm will have their BP\nlowering therapy intensified at trial entry since the tar-\nget will be automatically below their baseline BP\nwhereas only those patients in the standard arm whose\nBP is above 140\/90 mmHg will have their therapy inten-\nsified at the outset.\nIdentification of eligible patients\nEligible patients will be identified from general practices\nfrom the Central England Primary Care Research Net-\nwork and from the Midlands Research Practice Consor-\ntium (MidReC). Each practice will run a search of their\nclinical computer system to identify all patients on the\nstroke\/TIA register. Where possible, the computer\nsearch will exclude patients with clear exclusion criteria\n(see table 1). The GP will also remove patients for\nwhom a study invitation would be inappropriate (for\nexample, those with a terminal illness). Patients with no\nclear exclusion criteria at this stage will be sent a letter\ninviting them to attend a study baseline clinic\nappointment.\nBaseline clinic appointment\nThis clinic appointment is carried out by a Research\nNurse. At this appointment the nurse will: confirm the\nstroke\/TIA diagnosis through review of medical records\nand patient interview; determine whether there are any\nexclusion criteria present; and collect baseline data (see\ntable 2). If the patient is eligible and willing to take part,\nthe nurse will also gain written informed consent prior\nto randomisation, and will telephone the randomisation\nservice to obtain treatment group allocation.\nOnce the treatment allocation has been obtained,\npatients in the intensive target group and any patients\nwho have been randomised to the standard treatment\ngroup whose BP is above the target of 140 mmHg will\nsee a GP in order to have their treatment intensified\nusing the study specific treatment protocol (see figure 1).\nPatients in the standard group whose BP is below target\nwill receive an appointment to see the practice nurse\nthree months post randomisation.\nRandomisation\nThe randomisation will use minimisation to balance the\nrandomised groups on the basis of age (<80, \u226580), sex,\ndiabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation (because of the diffi-\nculties of obtaining accurate BP measurements in this\ngroup), baseline systolic BP and practice.\nPatient follow-up procedures\nPatients will be followed up from trial entry for 12\nmonths. Follow up will be carried out in several ways.\nFirstly, practice nurses (PNs) will see patients at 1-3\nmonthly intervals, depending on BP and treatment allo-\ncation. (see figure 2) The PN will take a patient\u2019s BP and\nrefer them to the GP if the BP is above target, or if the\npatient is having problems with adverse effects to their\nBP medication. The GP will then adjust the medication,\nfollowing the study treatment protocol (see figures 1). At\n6 and 12 months patients will be followed up by a\nresearch nurse (RN) where details of primary and sec-\nondary outcomes will be collected. (see table 2). Finally,\nthe records of patients will be flagged at the NHS Central\nRegister.\nPatient outcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure is a change in systolic\nblood pressure between baseline and 12 months. Blood\npressure measurements are performed in a standardised\nway, using BHS validated automated electronic monitors\nFletcher et al.

The patient will be\nseated for 5 minutes and then 6 measurements will be\ntaken at minute intervals. The second and third mea-\nsurements are averaged to give the reading. As the\nintensive target group have their BP monitored more\nfrequently than those in the standard group, there may\nbe some diminution of the \u2018white coat\u2019 effect in this\ngroup; the mean of readings 2 to 6 and the mean of 5\nand 6 will be used to monitor for this. Any differences\nbetween the groups in the primary outcome should be\nsustained in the mean of the 5th and 6th readings (by\nwhich time any accommodation effect is likely to have\nworn off), enabling us to determine whether accommo-\ndation has a significant effect in this study. 24 hour\nblood pressure recordings using an ambulatory sphyg-\nmomanometer will be recorded at baseline and at twelve\nmonths. 24 hour ambulatory measurement will be unaf-\nfected by accommodation, so will provide further evi-\ndence as to whether or not this was significant in this\nstudy.\nA variety of secondary outcome measures are also\nassessed during the RN follow up appointments. (see\ntable 2) Key secondary outcomes are: additional\nmeasures of BP (change in diastolic and mean daytime\nambulatory systolic BP between baseline and twelve\nmonths); measures of adherence (including GP adher-\nence to protocol and patient adherence to prescribed\nmedication); quality of life (EQ5 D [19]; SF36 [20]); side\neffects, tolerability and adverse events; clinical outcomes\n(including major cardiovascular events [composite of\nfatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction or fatal\ncoronary heart disease and other cardiovascular death],\nall cause mortality, cognitive function [21] and hospital\nadmissions). Key secondary events (stroke; myocardial\ninfarction; fatal coronary heart disease and other cardio-\nvascular death) will be reviewed by independent clini-\ncians blinded to treatment to ensure unbiased coding of\nthese events.\nSample size\nRandomisation of 610 patients (305 per arm), with 12\nmonths of follow-up, will detect a 5 mmHg difference in\nsystolic BP between groups with 90% power and at a\nsignificance level of 5% assuming a standard deviation of\n17.5 mmHg (a conservative estimate of standard devia-\ntion falling between 16, a figure derived from the same\nsort of patients as included in this study [11] and 19,\nFigure 1 Summary of Algorithm for BP control.\nFletcher et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2010, 10:37\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2261\/10\/37\nPage 5 of 8\nthe standard deviation in the PROGRESS Study [5]).\nThe calculation assumes that: a 5 mmHg difference in\nsystolic BP is of clinical significance, leading to a 20%\nreduction in major vascular events;[22] that there will\nbe 5% mortality at six months, and a further 10% of\npatients will not have their BP measured at six months.\nWith regard to ambulatory blood pressure measure-\nment, one of the secondary outcomes of the study, ran-\ndomisation of 450 patients (225 per arm) will detect a\n4 mmHg difference in systolic BP between groups with\n90% power and at a significance level of 5% assuming a\nstandard deviation of 11.7 mmHg [23]. This calculation\nassumes that 80% of patients will have ambulatory\nblood pressure measured at 12 months.\nTo recruit patients from primary care, an estimate of\nthe number of practices is required. Approximately 50\npractices with an average list size of 7,500 will be\nneeded in order to recruit the required number of\npatients. This will generate 5,625 patients on practice\nTIA\/stroke registers (from the QOF data, the overall\nprevalence of TIA\/stroke in primary care is 1.5%). From\nour analysis of South Birmingham data [11], we antici-\npate that 13% of these patients will be ineligible because\nthey are already on three or more anti-hypertensives,\nand 28% because they will not fulfil the diagnostic cri-\nteria for a history of stroke or TIA for the study [24].\nWe assume that 30% of patients will respond to the\ninvitation to attend a study clinic, that 24% of them will\nbe ineligible due to a systolic BP below 125, and a\nfurther 15% will decline to take part after discussion\nwith the research nurse. This equates to the recruitment\nof 12 patients per practice with an average list size of\n7,500.\nStatistical analysis\nThe principal analyses will use generalised linear mod-\nels, accounting for baseline BP as a patient level covari-\nate, and practices as random effects and compare\ndifferences in systolic BP (primary outcome), and differ-\nences in diastolic BP, quality of life, adherence and fre-\nquency of adverse effects (secondary outcomes). We will\nlook at effect on systolic BP lowering in pre-specified\nsub-groups: diabetes; atrial fibrillation; and age group.\nClinical event rates will be monitored by treatment allo-\ncation by the Data Monitoring & Ethics Committee, but\nonly aggregated rates will be made available to the\ninvestigators.\nEconomic evaluation\nDecision analytical modelling will be undertaken to\nsynthesise data from the trial and the literature in order\nto determine whether potential benefits of intensive\nblood pressure lowering (by lowering the risk of stroke)\nare outweighed by potential adverse effects on quality of\nlife. Ultimately the model analyses will inform whether a\nfurther trial, powered to detect differences in clinical\nend-points, is required.\nA Markov model will be constructed to consider\nintensive target and standard target strategies for blood\npressure lowering in patients with a history of stroke or\nTIA. The clinical events of importance in the model are\nfurther stroke events, myocardial infarction (MI) and\nother cardiovascular related mortality. Data from the\ntrial and literature will inform the probability of these\nevents occurring and the risk reduction afforded by the\nalternative strategies. Attached to each health state will\nbe associated health state utility values (quality of life)\nin order that quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) can be\ncalculated. Quality of life on each treatment strategy will\nbe obtained from the trial data on EQ-5 D, and previous\nstudies will inform post-stroke and post-MI values. In\naddition, in order that cost-effectiveness analyses can be\nFigure 2 follow up procedure.\nFletcher et al.

Probabilistic sensitiv-\nity analysis will be undertaken to incorporate the\nuncertainty around parameter values and quantify the\noverall decision uncertainty, and inform whether further\nresearch is required.\nQualitative Study\nSampling\nA purposively selected sample of 30 patients (10 each\nfrom intervention and control and 10 patients who\ndeclined the invitation to participate), and 20 healthcare\nprofessionals (Health Care Assistants (HCAs), nurses\nand GPs) will be selected for interview.\nPatient Sampling Strategy Sampling will be carried out\non the basis of study arm (intervention or control), with\na further group of people who did not consent to parti-\ncipate in the trial also being invited to attend for an\ninterview. Within each group, participants will be\nselected on the basis of: age (tertiles); socio-economic\nstatus (using IMD scores); number of different classes of\nmedications; and whether they have had a stroke or a\nTIA. A researcher will randomly select patients from\nthese categories, ensuring that similar numbers of\npatients in all categories are included.\nHealth care professionals sampling strategy Practices\nparticipating in the study were selected to ensure a\nrange of practice characteristics are represented, includ-\ning practice size and socio-economic status. A\nresearcher will randomly select 20 practitioners from\nthese practices and send an invitation letter and infor-\nmation sheet, inviting them to take part in an interview.\nPatients and practitioners who fail to respond to invi-\ntation or who do not wish to participate will be replaced\nby another patient\/practitioner with similar characteris-\ntics. This process will continue until theoretical satura-\ntion is achieved and interviews cease.\nInterviews\nSemi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews will be\ncarried out in patients\u2019 own homes or in other suitable\nlocations, or with healthcare professionals in the sur-\ngery, and will be conducted by a researcher trained in\nqualitative interviewing techniques. Fully informed con-\nsent will be obtained from interviewees at the start of\nthe interview, and a consent form signed. An interview\ntopic guide will be used (see additional file 1) which will\nthen be modified and refined during the first interviews.\nEach interview is expected to last between 60 and 90\nminutes, and will be audio taped and transcribed\nverbatim.\nData Analysis\nData collection and analysis will be iterative, occurring\nas data collection in the interviews proceeds. Data will\nbe analysed using a thematic approach, based on the\nprinciples of \u2018Framework\u2019 analysis [25] and using Frame-\nwork software. The research team will actively contri-\nbute to the development of the analysis and conceptual\nframework and their different disciplinary and profes-\nsional backgrounds will maximise theoretical sensitivity\n[16].\nTime plan\nPatient recruitment began in July 2009 and is planned to\ncontinue until February 2011. By October 2009, 23\npatients (4% of target) have been recruited into the trial.\nInterviews will commence in January 2010 and are\nexpected to be completed by February 2011.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this trial and the health economic analysis\nwill provide insight into the role of intensive blood pres-\nsure targets for people who have had a stroke or TIA. If\nthe trial is negative and a significant difference in systo-\nlic blood pressure is not observed between the two\nstudy arms, then the embedded qualitative work will be\nof importance to determine why low blood pressure tar-\ngets did not lead to lower blood pressure. If the trial is\npositive, then the critical question remains as to whether\nstriving for lower blood pressure targets is appropriate.\nIf we observe no difference in adverse event rates or\nquality of life between the two arms of the trial, then it\nis likely that aiming for lower blood pressure targets will\nbe worthwhile, given the benefits of reduced stroke risk\nthat were observed in the PROGRESS trial [5]. This will\nbe tested by our economic analysis. If, on the other\nhand, the lower blood pressures are at the cost of higher\nadverse event rates, then it may be that a further trial\npowered to detect differences in clinical end-points will\nbe required to guide clinical practice.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Interview guides.
