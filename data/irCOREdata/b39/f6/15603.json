Eliot, The Naming of Cats\nAbstract. This paper builds on the work presented at the ECDL 2006\n([29]) in automated genre classi\fcation as a step toward automating\nmetadata extraction from digital documents for ingest into digital repos-\nitories such as those run by archives, libraries and eprint services. We di-\nvide features of the documents into \fve types: features for visual layout,\nlinguistically modeled syntactic features, stylo-metric features, features\nfor semantic structure, and contextual features as an object linked to\npreviously classi\fed objects and other external sources. Results concern-\ning the \frst two types have been described elsewhere([29]). The current\npaper discusses results from testing classi\fers based on image and stylo-\nmetric features and shows that genres for which image features fail to\ncluster are the genres for which stylo-metric features cluster very well.\n1 Background and Objective\nIn [29], we summarised the valuable role of automated metadata extraction in\nthe cost-e\u000bective e\u000ecient management of digital collections: metadata play a\nkey role in management processes ([43], [23]) and the manual creation of meta-\ndata is expensive ([15], [23], [40]). As we pointed out in [29], ERPANET's ([18])\nPackaged Object Ingest Project ([19]) identi\fed automatic extraction tools for\ntechnical metadata (e.g. [33], [35]), and substantial work on descriptive meta-\ndata extraction within speci\fc domains has been conducted (e.g. [32], [13], [2],\n[50], [21], [22], [6], [26], [47], [51]) along with other work in information extrac-\ntion from text (e.g. [3], [9], [49], [48]). However, a general tool has yet to be\ndeveloped to extract metadata from digital objects of varied types and genres.\nThis paper further develops concepts of genre classi\fcation introduced in [29]\ninvolving the automatic grouping of documents into distinctive document types\nfollowed by focused metadata extraction from single document types as a means\nof creating a tool capable of extracting metadata across many domains at dif-\nferent semantic levels. To reiterate the argument in [29], identifying the genre\frst provides a mechanism to limit the scope of document forms from which\nto extract other metadata. Within a single genre, metadata such as author, ti-\ntle, keywords, identi\fcation numbers or references can be expected to appear in\na speci\fc style and region, and independent methods have been developed for\ngenre-speci\fc extraction of such metadata for some classes of documents (e.g.\nScienti\fc Papers). Note also that di\u000berent institutions focus on collecting and\nmanaging digital materials in di\u000berent genres; genre classi\fcation will support\nautomating the identi\fcation, selection, and acquisition of materials in keeping\nwith local collecting policies.\nA review of Biber ([7]), Karlgren et al. ([25]), Kessler et al. ([27]), Rauber et\nal. ([44]), Bagdanov et al. ([4]), Boese ([8]) , Finn et al. ([20]) and Santini ([45])\nexempli\fes the lack of consensus on the de\fnition of genre. Biber's analysis of\ndocument genres employed \fve functional dimensions (information, narration,\nelaboration, persuasion, abstraction) to characterise text, while Karlgren et al.\nand Boese concentrated on more popularly accepted genre classes such as FAQ,\nJob Description, Editorial or Reportage. Kessler et al. tried to address both\ntypes, while Finn et al. studied binary classi\fcations(fact versus opinion, positive\nversus negative reviews). Santini discussed general genre facets, while Bagdanov\nlimited his task to detecting speci\fc journals and brochures. Others ([44], [5])\nattempted the clustering of documents rather than classi\fcation. An overview of\nthe various e\u000borts in genre analysis can be found in a technical report by Santini\n([46]). A broader review of metadata extraction and genre classi\fcation is also\nbeing prepared by the DELOS NoE Digital Preservation Cluster and is expected\nto be completed before the publication of this paper.\nThe variety of de\fnitions adopted by these researchers illustrates a confused\ninterplay of two notions: one of structure and one of function. Structure is de\fned\nby the visual layout and is expected to be distinguishable mostly by measurable\nfeatures such as amount of white space; the length of the document, sentences, or\nwords; and, the presence or absence and location of headers, delimiters, images,\nor links. Function, on the other hand, is de\fned by the intended role of the\ndocument and is expected to be characterised mostly by linguistic models and\nsemantic analyses of the documents. The two notions are closely linked together\nby medium, process or event. For example, a scienti\fc research article is usually\nsructured so that a title is present on the \frst page followed by author, a\u000eliation,\na body of text consisting of sections, and \fnally a list of references. It has the\nfunction of communicating, arguing or describing research. The interrelationship\nof structure and function are represented by the formatting requirements of\njournals or conventions in the community or event for which the document was\ncreated. The requirements and conventions evolve to optimise the communicative\nintentionality within the context; other communities or events may \fnd di\u000berent\nstructures of documents to optimise the same function. Just as biologists study\nDNA as the building blocks of living organisms to understand the classes into\nwhich they have evolved within their environment, it seems important to identify\ndocuments by their structure and their function separately as building blocks\nto infer their genre class within a standardised schema. We seek to be able toachieve this by a full analysis of \fve document feature types: image features,\nsyntactic features, stylistic features, semantic structure, and domain knowledge\nfeatures. We aim to build a system which models the \fve feature sets for a\nschema of approximately seventy genres (Table 1).\nThe genres in Table 1 are not meant to be static: the schema has been evolving\nas we develop and incorporate well-structured classi\fcation standards and as we\nbecome aware of digital genres we had not encountered before or which have\njust emerged in the digital domain. The experiments in this paper have initially\nlimited the study to the image and stylistic feature sets on the nineteen most\nproli\fc genres in our experimental data set. Along with the results in [29], the\nresults here are intended to be another step towards a full analysis.\nThe experimental data in this paper is from the pool of 570 PDF ([37]) \fles\nthat were sampled randomly from the Internet as described in [29]. As explained\nin [29], by con\fning the work to studying PDF \fles, we hope to put a boundary\non the problem space, while working with a widely used portable format for\ndigital objects ingested into digital repositories.\nTable 1.

Also note that the bottom-up approach of starting from genre-\nspeci\fc extraction may results in several tools, which are overly dependent on\nthe structures of the documents in the domain, with no obvious means of inter-\noperability: the top-down approach of creating a tool which looks across genres,\nto be re\fned further within the domain, will enable us to avoid this problem.\n2 Classi\fers\nThe experiments described in this paper involve the use of two classi\fers:\nImage classi\fer: this classi\fer depends on features extracted from the PDF\ndocument when handled as an image. It uses the module pdftoppm from XPDF\n([36]) to extract the \frst page of the document as an image. The resulting image\nis divided into a sixty-six by sixty-six grid1. Then Python's Image Library (PIL)\n([41], [39]) is employed to extract pixel values in each region. Each region is given\na value of 0 or 1 depending on the amount of non-white pixel values it contains .\nThe result is modeled using Na \u0010ve Bayes available with the Weka ([52]) machine\nlearning toolkit.\nStylo-metric classi\fer: this classi\fer looks at the frequency of selected words,\nnumber of font changes, the di\u000berence between the largest font size and smallest\nfont size, length of the document , average length of words, and number of\nwords in the front page of the document. The font information was extracted\non the level of words using a modi\fed version of pdftohtml ([38]), developed by\nVolker Heydegger at the University of Cologne. The modi\fed version converts\na PDF document to a XML \fle with all the font information for each word in\nthe document. A word list was automatically constructed containing all words\nwhich appear in more than half of the \fles in any one genre. For each \fle, the\nfrequency of each word was recorded as a vector then augmented by length and\nfont information. The result was modeled using Na \u0010ve Bayes in the Weka ([52])\nmachine learning toolkit.\nThis paper expresses the view that the image along with the stylistic fea-\ntures will capture the structural elements of genres while the language model\ncombined with the stylistic and semantic features will help to separate docu-\nments of distinct functional categories. Involving the image of a document in the\nclassi\fcation also enables the management of documents without violating se-\ncurity, maximises the viability of a language independent tool, frees the process\nfrom being solely dependent on text processing tools with encoding requirements\nand problems relating to special characters2, and makes the method applicable\nto paper documents digitally imaged (i.e. scanned).\n1 The choice of the dimension re\nects the fact that it seemed to produce the best\nresults at the time but further analysis may be necessary.\n2 pdftohtml failed to extract information from seventeen percent of the documents.\nThe image processing did not fail on any documents.3 Experiments\nThere are three main experiments described in this paper:\nClustering experiment: this experiment compared the cluster resolution for\ntwo sets of features: the image features and the stylo-metric features. We grouped\nthe data in nineteen genres into two clusters using the Weka Machine Learning\nToolkit's ([52]) Estimation-Maximisation algorithm. The purpose was to see how\nwell the \fles in each genre group into one cluster. The result is expressed in terms\nof the percentage of \fles within each genre which have been grouped into one\ncluster.\nPeriodicals versus Thesis: in this experiment, we took documents in the gen-\nres Periodicals and Thesis. We used the image classi\fer to classify the documents\nby using 10 fold cross validation.\nPeriodicals versus Non-periodicals: we expanded on the experiment above\nto group four more genres with the genre Thesis as one group labelled Non-\nperiodicals. The four additional classes are Business or Operational Report, Min-\nutes, Fictional Book, and Academic Book. The four extra classes were chosen\nfrom the genres that were grouped in the same image cluster as Thesis.\n4 Results\nTable 2 shows the results of the clustering experiment. The key \fnding in this\nexperiment is that the genres for which image features fail to cluster are the\ngenres for which stylo-metric features cluster very well. For instance, note that\nScienti\fc Research Articles divide half and half into each cluster with no pref-\nerence when using the visual features while ninety two percent group into one\ncluster when using stylo-metric features. The opposite is true of Periodicals.\nThe results described in Tables 3, 4 and 5 use three standard indices in\nclassi\fcation tasks: accuracy, precision and recall. Let N be the total number of\ndocuments in the data, Nc the number of documents in the data set which are\nin class C, T the total number of correctly labelled documents in the data set\nindependent of the class, Tc the number of true positives for class C, and Fc the\nnumber of false positives for class C. Accuracy is de\fned to be A = T\nN; precision\nand recall for class C is de\fned to be Pc = Tc\n(Tc+Fc) and Rc = Tc\nNc, respectively.\nTable 3 gives the result when the data set was con\fned to Periodicals and Theses.\nThe accuracy was surprisingly high. To check if the results actually re\nect the\ndistinctiveness of image features in periodicals, the experiment was repeated with\nfour more classes of non-periodical documents added to Thesis to form a group\nof Non-periodicals (results in Tables 4 and 5). A slight decrease in performance\nis visible in Table 4 (cf. Table 3), but the accuracy is still quite high. On the\nother hand the results for the stylistic classi\fer in Table 5 show that stylistic\nfeatures do not fare as well in distinguishing Periodicals. For a proper evaluation\nof the performance, a signi\fcance test is in order (pending), but a di\u000berence of\n17.6% in overall accuracy can not be ignored by the strictest of observers, and a\ndecrease in precision on Periodicals from 73.9% to 47.8% (a di\u000berence of 26.1%)Table 2.

The results in\nTables 2 and 3, indicate that Periodicals have more clearly distinguishing image\nfeatures than stylo-metric features, while Table 4 suggests that Thesis shares its\nimage features with four other genres. Previous reports ([29], [30]) indicated thatTable 4.

If we were to train on su\u000ecient data, this\nis not a problem; the non-distinguishing features will be \fltered out as noise.\nIt is, however, very di\u000ecult to have su\u000ecient data when constructing a tool\nwhich is intended to have dynamic and domain-independent properties. In [28]\nand [31], the CANDC part-of-speech tagger ([10]), reputed to have performed\nwell elsewhere, was employed to tag words in an Astronomy research articles. In\nAstronomy there is frequent usage of the term He to refer to the chemical element\nHelium. The tagger, which was trained on the Wall Street Journal articles, tagged\nHe to be a pronoun for all instances, propagating further errors on subsequent\nwords. Separating features into smaller groups will minimise the impact of such\nartefacts, by trying to exclude the noise from the start, making the most of the\ndi\u000bering feature strengths for each genre type. The key seems to lie in identifying\nwhich genres belong to which type and to combine the classi\fers in a reasonable\nway to build a general classi\fer.\nFurther improvement can also be envisioned by integrating more classi\fers\ninto the decision process. In [29] we suggested the following classi\fers:\n{ Extended image classi\fer which looks at more than the \frst page of the\ndocument: we could process the image of pages other than the \frst page\nof the document or several pages of the document in parallel. This would\nhowever involve several decisions:the optimal number of pages to be used\nand the best way to combine the information from di\u000berent pages need to\nbe determined (e.g. will several pages be considered to be one image; if not,\nhow will the classi\fcation of synchronised pages be statistically combined to\ngive a global classi\fcation).\n{ Language model classi\fer on the level of POS and phrases built on\nthe part-of-speech tags (tags which denote whether a word is a verb, noun\nor preposition) of the underlying words and also on partial chunk tags (tags\nindicating noun phrases, verb phrases or prepositional phrases).{ Semantic classi\fer modeling subjective or objective noun phrases (e.g. us-\ning [42]) and latent semantic analysis may be necessary for \fner distinctions\nin document\n{ Contextual Classi\fer built on source information of the document such\nas the name of the journal or address of the web page, and anchor texts or\nsubject or domain information.\nThere are two obvious ways of gauging the performance of a genre classi\fer:\ncomparing against human performance and measuring the stability of the perfor-\nmance as you transfer it across domains. We are undertaking an experiment to\nexamine human performance. A signi\fcant amount of disagreement is expected\nin labelling genre even between human labellers; we intend to cross check the\nlabelled data in two ways:\n1. Document Retrieval Exercise (DRE): We plan to employ a cohort of\npostgraduates in information science who will be assigned genres from Ta-\nble 1. They will retrieve one hundred PDF documents for each of the genres\nthey have been assigned, and give a brief description of the source of the\ndocument and the reasons for including the document in their collection.\n2. Re-labelling Experiment: We will anonymise the \fle names of the doc-\numents collected in the DRE and randomise the document sequence. This\ncorpus will be presented to two new groups of labellers drawn from di\u000berent\nbackgrounds for re-classifying. They will not have access to the initial genre\nclassi\fcation information.\nThe \frst experiment will create a pool of PDF \fles which have already been\nclassi\fed into genres by established organisations and users; this will serve as\na reference point, and help us to index the performance on well-designed clas-\nsi\fcation standards. The re-labelling experiment will enable us to compare the\ndisagreement of the three classes of labellers over the same data set: this will\nhelp to determine the maximum level of accuracy at which the automated sys-\ntem can be expected to perform and determine which genres are better de\fned\nby looking at percentage of \fles in agreement within each genre.\nThe longer term aim, once a genre classi\fer with performance comparable to\nan average human labeller has been developed, will be to integrate the method\nwith other tools which extract author, title, date, identi\fer, keywords, language,\nsummarisations and other compositional properties of \fles within a single genre,\nand combine the tool with ingest models developed elsewhere.\nAcknowledgements: This research is a part of The Digital Curation Cen-\ntre's (DCC) ([12]) research programme.
