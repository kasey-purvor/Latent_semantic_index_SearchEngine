In a thought-provoking paper \non this topic, Daniel Dennett even goes so far as to define the self as a \u201ccenter of \nnarrative gravity\u201d.  As he reminds us, a centre of gravity is not a physical thing (like an \natom) but rather a theorist\u2019s useful fiction.   It follows from this that there is no real self \nout there \u2013 one which might, for instance, be found in some part of the brain.  All we can \nhope to \u201clocate\u201d is the self constructed by us from the fragments of our lives.  Dennett \nconcludes that: \n\u2026 we are virtuoso novelists, who find ourselves engaged in all sorts of behavior, \nmore or less unified, but sometimes disunified, and we always put the best \u201cfaces\u201d \non it we can.  We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story.  \nAnd that story is our autobiography (1992:114).  \n \nThis sounds highly creative: the self as a work of art.  Indeed, to take up the argument of \nthe editors in their Introduction, the example of autobiography might help us move away \nfrom overly \u201cholistic\u201d or \u201cculturalist\u201d (and thus potentially deterministic) accounts of the \nhuman imagination \u2013 which tend to aggregate up to collective experience.  Individual life \nstories, by contrast, are surely always idiosyncratic in some way.  But exactly how do we \nlearn who we are, and find the tools with which to construct (for ourselves, for others) the \nstories of our lives?  As a cognitive scientist, Dennett approaches consciousness and self-\nawareness as evolved attributes of human minds\/brains. Needless to say, for him the \nempirical reality of how we come to tell stories about ourselves is hugely complex.  In \nwhat follows, I will also adopt a naturalistic approach to the issue, albeit a simpler (and \nmore familiarly anthropological) one.  I want to outline how certain \u201cartefacts\u201d or \ntechnologies of the Chinese long term \u2013 those linked to numbers and numerology \u2013 relate \nto the imaginative projects of people in China and Taiwan.   \n \nNumbers?  Many readers may find the idea of associating numbers with imagination and \nwith autobiography somewhat counterintuitive.  Surely numbers are intrinsically dull: the \ngrey stuff of accountancy, bureaucracy and science.  By contrast, our life stories seem \nprecisely to defy quantification.  They help us resist \u2013 sometimes very consciously \u2013 \nbeing \u201creduced to a number\u201d.  However in the Chinese tradition, numbers themselves \nmay be seen as creative, meaningful, even poetic things, and they figure prominently in \naccounts of the self.  Furthermore, although numbers might be said to restrict, in some \nsenses, what can be said about things, restriction as such is not seen as a bad (that is, in \nthis context, \u201canti-imaginative\u201d) thing. Briefly, although imagination is often associated, \nat least in the Western folk view, with freedom, openness and improvisation, in the \nChinese tradition one (also) finds the idea that imagination is best explored within \nconstraints.  This is famously so in Chinese calligraphy, where exact copying is the (very \n 1\nlong) prelude to experimentation \u2013 which itself remains heavily rule-bound (Yen 2005).   \nMoreover, the constraining rules of creativity in Chinese art and culture are often \nnumerical or \u201cstructural\u201d in some sense \u2013 e.g. in classical poetry, where each word, \nhowever brilliantly unexpected, has to fit what is effectively a mathematical plan.1\n \nIf this seems too abstract (and perhaps overly focused on classical traditions), I should \nstress that my main points about numbers, imagination and self-narration are \nstraightforwardly ethnographic ones.   The people I\u2019ve met during fieldwork in rural \nChina and Taiwan have tended to be very interested in numbers, which appear to fire \ntheir imaginations (in ways that I personally find surprising).   This is partly because \nnumbers play an important role in certain Chinese stories about reality, about what is \npossible, and about what is likely.  Popular numerical \u201ctools\u201d of various kinds \u2013 artefacts \nof Chinese cultural history \u2013 are put to use by them in their working and private lives.  In \nshort, numerical understandings are a crucial part of the framework through which they \ninterpret reality and imagine or \u201ccalculate\u201d themselves as part of it.  \n \nThe importance of numbers in South Bridge \n \nIn the southern Taiwanese community of South Bridge, Mr and Mrs Chen sell cold teas \nand iced tofu sweets from a small stand in the central plaza in front of the main village \ntemple.2   They are business people, so it is hardly surprising that they are numerate, nor \nis it surprising that they are interested in the numerical bottom line.  Every day after \nwork, having had a shower, Mrs Chen counts up \u2013 with pleasure, she says \u2013 the New \nTaiwan Dollars handed over by her customers. The cash is then deposited in a farmer\u2019s \nassociation account from where most of it, until recently, has been used to support Mrs \nChen\u2019s son at university.  There is nothing obviously profound or \u201cphilosophical\u201d about \nthe use of numbers in activities such as calculating prices, counting income, or scanning \naccount balances for errors.   These techniques of quantification are part of Mrs Chen\u2019s \n                                                 \n1 In classical poetry there are rules about the numbers of characters (and thus syllables) in \na line, but also strict rules \u2013 which are effectively \u201cstructural\u201d and\/or mathematical \u2013 \ngoverning the relationships between the \u201ctones\u201d of the characters\/lines in a verse.   (As I \ndiscuss below, Chinese is a tonal language in which rising, falling, etc., tones help \ndetermine the meaning of individual syllables\/words.)  This makes things much harder \nfor poets, because it heavily restricts their choice of words.   \n2 In order to project the privacy of informants, all place and personal names, and some \npersonal details, have been changed.  My fieldwork in South Bridge was carried out in \n2000-2001 during an ESRC-funded project  on numeracy and folk accounting in China \nand Taiwan (project number R000239088).  There are, of course, very significant \ndifferences between the popular culture of rural Taiwan and rural China, including \ndifferences in numerical culture, but in this brief paper I am unable to explore these \ndifferences in much depth (although see below).  I am extremely grateful to the people \nwho facilitated my research, including colleagues at National Tsing Hua University and \nthe people of South Bridge itself, most especially the very warm and generous couple \nwho are referred to in this paper as \u201cMr and Mrs Chen\u201d.  I discuss their circumstances in \nmore detail in Stafford 2006.   \n 2\nordinary working life, comparable in some respects to the mundane technologies (of \nfreezing, ice-blending, electrical lighting, etc.) that help make her business possible.   \n \nHaving said this, numerical reasoning clearly is one of the means through which \nindividuals (including sellers of iced tofu sweets) develop a picture \u2013 sometimes a very \nsophisticated one \u2013 of what is going on with their businesses and more generally with \ntheir lives.  The routine of reckoning profits, for example, has helped Mrs Chen develop a \ngood understanding of the relevant business cycles (and theirs, as it happens, is a highly \nseasonal business). Meanwhile, counting up and parcelling out money for her son\u2019s \neducation helps her quantify something complex \u2013 and, in the event, highly emotional \u2013 \nabout the link between work and investments made in her son\u2019s future.  In short, simple \narithmetic is, for Mrs Chen, a way of thinking about and describing important economic \nand social realities.   \n \nBut there\u2019s more.  As I have discussed in other publications, numbers are rarely just \nnumbers in China and Taiwan \u2013 neutral tools for description and evaluation.  For they are \ncentral to some of the most important Chinese\/Taiwanese cultural narratives, and an \ninterlinked range of special uses of numbers is highly salient in everyday life (Stafford \n2003, 2004, 2006, 2007). The first, very obvious, dimension of this is the use of numbers \nas markers of \u201cvalue\u201d \u2013 e.g. to set prices, or to denominate profit and loss.  If the people \nI\u2019ve met during fieldwork are keenly interested in numbers, it is undoubtedly in part \nbecause of the explicit and unremitting link drawn between numbers, money, economic \ncalculation, profit and wealth.  \n \nBeyond this, numbers are seen to say something interesting about the predictability and \nthe randomness of life.  Consider three brief illustrations of this, observed at the Chen\u2019s \ncold tea stand.  First, I\u2019ve seen a friend of theirs carry out suan bihua, \u201ccalculating the \nbrush-strokes\u201d.  This is a relatively simple kind of fortune-telling in which the numbers \nof strokes in the characters of a person\u2019s name are used to make predictions about her \nfuture. In certain cases, names are actually changed so that these brush-stroke \ncalculations will suggest more auspicious outcomes.  (Note that all Chinese divination \ntechniques are numerical\/mathematical  in some sense.)  Second, I\u2019ve seen the Chens \nprepare offerings for the deities and other spirits (especially ancestors) they worship at \ntheir home and in temples.  Such offerings are always carefully counted out \u2013 three of \nthis, four of that, six of the other \u2013 and indeed almost all aspects of Chinese popular \nreligious practice are heavily numericized in this way.   If the numbers change, the \nmeaning of a particular religious act is fundamentally altered.  Third, I\u2019ve seen the Chens \ndoing what most people in Taiwan do from time to time: selecting numbers for the \nlottery.  This is a kind of obsession, and techniques for arriving at winning numbers are a \nregular topic of conversation in streets and markets.   As everyone knows, playing the \nlottery is not completely unlike doing religion, and in fact religious means are often used \nto enhance one\u2019s chances.  Sometimes winning numbers are revealed, for example, in \nincense smoke as it floats over an altar and is \u201cconsumed\u201d by a god. \n \nI could give more examples, but a pattern already emerges.  In addition to being a way of \ntalking about \u201cvalue\u201d, numbers are a prominent aspect of Chinese practices related to \n 3\nluck and destiny.  They are revelatory of human \u201cfate\u201d, and they play a key role in \nattempts to predict, manipulate and inoculate oneself against the course of events.  Note \nthat such uses of numbers are often explicitly linked back to the use of numbers as \nmarkers of value.  A good deal of divination and religious practice is, unsurprisingly, \ndirected towards enhancing wealth and gaining financial security. \n \nIf numbers are important because they relate to \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cfate\u201d, of equal importance is \ntheir relation to a third term which I will gloss as \u201clogic\u201d.  It is hard to summarise this \nbriefly.  But in China the logic of reality is, in some basic sense, rendered numerically.  \nOne simple illustration is the frequent use, in official and popular culture, of numbered \nlists which clarify the field of play in a given domain: e.g. the slogan \u201cThree Principles of \nthe People\u201d (which sums up a political philosophy) or the designation \u201cTen-Star Civilized \nHousehold\u201d (which commends households for proper civility).  Numericization along \nthese lines generates a simple logical framework for thinking.  However there are much \nmore abstract versions of the same thing, which might be labelled \u201cstructuralist\u201d.  Briefly, \nChinese culture provides an excellent illustration of Levi-Strauss\u2019s thesis about the role \nof structural logics \u2013 which may, precisely, be seen as mathematical \u2013 in human thought.  \nExplicitly oppositional\/dialectical logics are found almost everywhere one looks: in \npoetry, architecture, popular religion, myth, kinship, etc.  Furthermore, this structuralist \nway of expressing the logic of the world and the universe is often explicitly numericized \nor made mathematical \u2013 as in the Yi Jing, and in the use of numbers in the \u201ctwinned \ncouplets\u201d (duilian) of Chinese poetry.  My point is that ordinary people regularly \nencounter this sophisticated use of numerical\/mathematical\/structuralist reasoning, and \nthat it is a pervasive means of expressing the logic of reality.   \n \nNow let me return to the cold tea stand in South Bridge.  In her working life, Mrs Chen \ndeals with numbers on a routine level.  But both in work and in the patterns of everyday \ncommunal activity that constantly interrupt her working time, she also experiences \nnumbers in a range of more complex ways.  Here (in divination, for instance) numbers \nare not merely practical tools for counting and calculating.  They also say something \nmeaningful \u2013 sometimes even poetic \u2013 about value, about the fatefulness of human \nexperience, and about the logic of the universe.   This means that to live with numbers is \nto live with a set of complex, and potentially very powerful, tools.  How does this relate \nto imagination and self-narration?  My claim is that numeracy is an important means \nthrough which people in rural China and Taiwan gain knowledge about themselves, and \nabout the world around them.   And when people like Mrs Chen tell stories about \nthemselves, i.e. when they spin out the story of their lives, quantification is typically \nintegral to the narrative.    \n \nNumbers in the story of Mrs Chen\u2019s life \n \nBut I should be more specific, because everything I have said so far is consistent with a \n\u201cculturalist\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d account of the Chinese numerical imagination.  That is: Mrs \nChen has undoubtedly mastered, to some extent, a repertoire of ideas from Chinese \nnumerical culture \u2013 some of which, as it happens, are incredibly widely distributed across \ntime and space.  Holding these ideas is part of what makes people \u201cbe Chinese\u201d.  So \n 4\nwhere does individualism (the room for creativity, or even idiosyncracy) actually come \nin?   \n \nOne point is that the kind of accounting, and life-accounting, I\u2019m referring to is often \nimprecise.  It is much looser and more \u201ccreative\u201d than one might expect.  For instance, \nalthough Mrs Chen counts her income daily it turns out that she does not actually reckon \nher expenses, nor do she and Mr Chen bother with any formal system of accounting at all \nfor their business.  As she told me, it\u2019s always small amounts of cash, and anyway it is \n\u201cour own money\u201d, ziji de qian.  Meanwhile, buying from and selling to others often \ninvolves a similar inexactness vis-\u00e0-vis price, e.g. a sense that arriving at a \u201cgood \nsounding number\u201d (haoting de shuzi) \u2013 normally one that is auspicious or fair-sounding \u2013 \nmay be more important than actually doing proper sums (cf. Stafford 2003).  It isn\u2019t as if \nthe numbers are determining the narrative here \u2013 in many cases it could, in fact, be said to \nbe the other way around.   \n \nTo give a more personal example of this fluidity, when Mrs Chen talks, as she often does, \nabout the cost of her son\u2019s education, the numbers are clearly intended only as a rough, \nand evocative, guide.  One day she told me it had cost NT$2,000,000 to put their son \nthrough university, but the next day it had risen to NT$3,000,000!   This particular sum \u2013 \nhowever vague \u2013 is no doubt striking for Mrs Chen, a woman from a relatively poor \nbackground who as a child did back-breaking work in the salt fields around South Bridge.  \nWhat also seems important to the Chens is the fact that their son, during his studies, has \nbeen very cautious in spending the money sent by his parents.  They delight in listing the \nprices of things (such as noodles) in the city where he lives, against which their son\u2019s \nfrugality is, of course, all the more striking.  Mr Chen told me several times that it causes \nhis heart to ache (xinli hen tongku) to know that his son has been so careful with their \nmoney, to the extent of sometimes failing to eat enough.   \n \nOf course, even these are well-known cultural stereotypes: the hard-working parents from \na poor background who want something better for their son; the filial son who struggles \ndutifully to live up to his parents\u2019 expectations and to repay their support.  And yet, as \none gets into the details of Mrs Chen\u2019s (individual) case, interesting links emerge \nbetween numbers, money, gender, kinship, emotions \u2013 and imagination.  Focusing on \nthese links, I suggest, helps illuminate the space between \u201cculturally-determined\u201d (and \nthus very common) life trajectories and the uniqueness of individual narratives.   \n \nAs I\u2019ve noted elsewhere, Mr Chen has been involved in several different lines of business \nover the years, none of which has been entirely successful (Stafford 2007).  However, his \nwife\u2019s business (of selling cold teas and iced tofu sweets) has worked out relatively well, \nso now the two of them rely on it entirely \u2013 more specifically, on the slow, steady, \naccumulation of profit as measured out in Mrs Chen\u2019s daily counting-up.  They both told \nme (to return to a cultural stereotype) that in Taiwan \u201cit is women who control the \nmoney\u201d (nuren guan qian).  One reason for this, they say, is that men like Mr Chen \nbasically \u201ccannot calculate\/reckon\u201d (bu hui suan) \u2013 meaning not that they are incapable \nof doing simple arithmetic, but rather that they find it harder than women to pursue profit, \nand also that they find it harder than women to be thrifty.  More specifically, Mrs Chen \n 5\ntold me, her husband was inclined to spend money on cigarettes and collectable tea sets.  \nBack in the days when they had no money at all, he \u201ccould not reckon\u201d and save, she \nsaid, and the same remains true today.  However, her son clearly can reckon, at least to \nthe extent of being cautious with his parents\u2019 hard-earned cash.  If he needs to spend a \nsignificant sum, he always calls his mother (not his father) for approval.  Similarly, Mrs \nChen\u2019s husband tells her if he wants to buy something, and she gives him the cash.  \n \nIn extremely simple terms, then, the story of Mrs Chen\u2019s life (as she tells it on at least \nsome occasions, thus contributing to her own centre of narrative gravity) is one in which \nshe works carefully, accumulating the money needed to send her son to university, while \npushing against her husband\u2019s (supposed) tendencies to buy and to spend.  Emotional \nrelations with her husband and son are clearly mediated by money.  But in the telling, \nmoney becomes a numerical thing \u2013 thus linking her money-narrative up with other \nsimilarly numericised aspects of life experience, such as fortune telling, religious worship \nand gambling.  For instance, her son\u2019s academic success, of which she is hugely proud, is \n(obviously?) measured numerically \u2013 via his achievements in competitive examinations \nand his position in numerical class rankings, which in Taiwan are a focus of intense \nparental concern.   \n \nThen there is the fact that her beloved father was a spirit medium.  Partly as a result of \nthis she and her husband are to this day heavily immersed in the \u2013 highly numerological \u2013 \nworld of Chinese\/Taiwanese popular religion.   As I noted above, numbers provide a way \nof talking about \u201cfate\u201d within this tradition, and of pinpointing and possibly altering \nindividual, familial and communal destinies in the flow of time.  But in religious life \nthere is also accounting of a more mundane sort.  As Mrs Chen explained to me, she and \nher husband have (reluctantly) become responsible, because of their deep respect for her \nfather, for sustaining the rituals held at the altar where his spirit medium cult was based \nbefore his death.  To this day, she therefore has to count up everything related to these \nreligious observances  (in effect, calculating the offerings), but she also has to do the final \nreckonings and act as organiser and chief accountant for all of the other participants, \nwhether she wants to or not.   Again, numbers are part of the story \u2013 sometimes rather \nobliquely but often in a strikingly central way \u2013 of her emotional relationship with her \ndeceased father, as well as with her husband and her son.     \n \nIt is interesting, then, that although social scientists might think of numbers primarily as a \nway of aggregating the (otherwise unmanageably diverse) experiences of individuals, for \nMrs Chen numbers are one way of differentiating her story from everybody else\u2019s.  \nVirtually all Taiwanese parents spend money educating their children, of course, but the \namount she has spent is possibly more than anybody she knows, and her son\u2019s results \nhave generally been as good as (and on occasion better than) those of any other young \nperson from South Bridge. When Mr and Mrs Chen organise an event at her father\u2019s \naltar, the numbers (of participants, of \u201cvisiting detities\u201d, of offerings, of cash \ncontributions) are part of the story \u2013 making her religious practice distinguistiable, in \nquantity if not in quality, from that of her neighbours.  Her personal accounting system, \nin short, helps her set herself apart, just as the accounting of diviners and \u201ccalculating \ndestiny persons\u201d (suanmingren) would ascribe to her, or to anybody else who bothered to \n 6\nask, a life trajectory which is unique.  To put this differently, although numbers appear to \naggregate things, restricting the scope for what can be said (because they simply tell us \n\u201chow things are\u201d once everything is added up), in reality numbers may equally help \ndisaggregate individuals from collectives and may also help them to see (and to say) \nsomething new about their lives.   An interesting (and, it seems, psychologically \ncompelling) illustration of this is found in lottery numbers: more or less everyone in \nSouth Bridge has a ticket but to have the ticket with the winning numbers is, of course, a \ndifferent thing altogether.   \n \nThe actual process of learning numbers \n \nI\u2019ve been suggesting, in brief, that people like Mrs Chen sometimes \u201cnarrate the self \nnumerically\u201d.  How, then, should anthropologists go about studying this phenomenon?   \nObviously we can, among other things, describe the everyday uses of numeracy in places \nlike South Bridge in order to explicate China\u2019s rich numerical culture.  We can look in \ndetail at the cases of people like Mrs Chen and hear what they have to say for themselves.  \nHowever this may not, in itself, get us very far with the question of how they actually \nlearn what they know about numbers, or the more general question of what makes human \nnumerical learning possible \u2013 either in cognitive or historical terms.  \n \nHere I want to mention the work of the cultural psychologist Michael Cole (1996).  \nInspired by Vygotskian models of cognitive development, Cole suggests that studies of \npsychological phenomena should be made with reference to three interlinked \ndevelopmental processes.   The first, phylogenesis, refers to species evolution, in this \ninstance to the evolution of cognitive abilities and constraints in humans.  Numerical \nthinking, for its part, depends not only on neurophysiological realities put in place by \nevolution but also on evolved domain-specific abilities which dispose us to respond to \n\u201cnumber\u201d and numerical information in our environments in particular ways (see \nDehaene 1988, Butterworth  1999).  Cole\u2019s second process, ontogenesis, refers to the \ndevelopment of individual organisms over time.  For example, on the road to mastering \ncomplex numerical reasoning, children obviously go through a long process of learning.  \nThis involves interactions not only with physical objects in the natural world but also \nwith other kinds of \u201cthings\u201d such as language, school-based mathematics instruction and \nelectronic calculators (see Karmiloff-Smith 1996).  These bring us to Cole\u2019s third \ndevelopmental process: the cultural-historical.  Briefly, over the course of history, human \nsocieties\/cultures have produced various tools or artefacts \u2013 such as languages, schools, \nelectronic calculators \u2013 which, in turn, profoundly mediate individual cognitive \ndevelopment, including the acquisition of \u201cnumber\u201d. \n \nMediations of this kind are intrinsic to Cole\u2019s model.  That is, his three developmental \nprocesses are intimately linked to one another, and none can be said to operate \nindependently of the others.  For example, a Chinese child\u2019s growing understanding of \nnumber (an illustration of ontogenetic development) is mediated not only by her evolved \ncognitive abilities (an illustration of phylogenetic development) but also by her exposure \nto artefacts (an illustration of cultural-historical development) such as Chinese counting \nterms and a popular cosmology in which, as I\u2019ve said, numbers relate to \u201cvalue\u201d, \u201cfate\u201d \n 7\nand \u201clogic\u201d. But the point isn\u2019t simply that the child is the outcome of prior phylogenetic \nand cultural-historical processes.  On the contrary, she is \u2013 through activity and ongoing \npractice in the world \u2013 simultaneously the producer and transformer of cultural \nknowledge.  Otherwise, where would the artefacts have come from in the first place?3\n \nConsider the influence of one especially important cultural-historical artefact, language, \nin a bit more detail.  We know, from the psychological literature, that language use and \nthe development of numeracy are intimately linked.   This is illustrated in Karen Fuson\u2019s \nfascinating research on children\u2019s counting, in which she describes the complex \nrelationship between counting words and children\u2019s developing grasp of numerosity and \nnumerical logics (Fuson 1988).  As might be expected, features of particular languages, \ne.g. the structure of their counting words, have an impact on children\u2019s acquisition of \nnumeracy.  Now it happens that the Chinese language \u2013 an artefact of Chinese history \u2013 \nhas a very logical system of counting words, one which is entirely consistent with the \nbase-ten logic used in most modern arithemetic.  As a result, this language is a positive \naid to the development of numeracy.   It is easier for a child to learn to count to twenty, \nand on to one hundred, in Chinese than it is in, say, English.  As a result, the \npsychologists argue, Chinese children (and those working in related languages such as \nJapanese and Korean) not only generally learn how to count to twenty and to one hundred \nsooner than their counterparts elsewhere, they also develop a good grasp of base-ten \nlogic, and therefore of simple arithmetic, at a younger age (Geary 1994).  \n \nBut counting words are not the only feature of the Chinese language which relates to the \ndevelopment of numerical thinking.  As I\u2019ve pointed out elsewhere, many such features \u2013 \nincluding the average speed of pronunciation of counting words, the obligatory use of \n\u201cmeasure words\u201d when counting objects, and the numerical aspects of the Chinese \nwriting system \u2013 may influence, in different ways, a child\u2019s developing relationship to \nnumerical knowledge (Stafford 2003).  Some of these influences are not immediately \nobvious.  For example, Chinese is a tonal language and this means that number words (in \ncommon with all words) are, if you like, sung rather than spoken.  That is, each of them is \nenunciated with a particular pitch and pattern.  In Mandarin, one is yi, spoken with the \nflat first tone.  Two is er, spoken with the falling fourth tone.  Five is wu, spoken with the \nwavy third tone.  Ten is shi, spoken with the rising second tone.  This tonality also means \nthat number combinations, e.g. 1949, have a characteristic \u201cmelody\u201d which may, in \ncertain contexts, make them more memorable.  Ease of memorisation, in turn, may have \nan impact on the ability of individuals to do mental (rather than written) calculations.  \nThe effect of this is probably incredibly small, but it nevertheless exists as a micro-\ninfluence on numerical cognition.  \n \nThe point I\u2019m getting at is that in order to be comprehensive, the anthropology of \nnumeracy (and by extension, of the numerical imagination) might need a framework \n                                                 \n3 She is also, by implication, a contributor to the pattern of human evolution.  Remember, \nfor example, that cultural-historical artefacts \u2013 collective products of human cognition \nand therefore also, equally, of ontogenesis \u2013 may be seen, in evolutionary terms, as \nfitness-increasing or fitness-decreasing. \n 8\nwhich is more microscopic than the standard anthropological one (which rarely deals \nwith variables as small as the tonality of counting terms, cf. Stafford forthcoming).  At \nthe same time, it might need to be more macroscopic \u2013 prepared to take long-term \nhistorical and natural historical processes into account.  On the natural historical said, \nCole\u2019s model of learning incorporates, as I\u2019ve said, phylogenesis, i.e. species evolution, \nrecognising the cognitive endowments humans have as a result of it.  This is not the kind \nof thing that socio-cultural anthropologists are necessarily happy to engage with, but I \nsuspect that Cole\u2019s nuanced account (in which phylogenesis, ontogenesis and cultural-\nhistorical developments are intrinsically interlinked) would get a sympathetic reading \nfrom most of them. \n \nIn any case, a child learning to count and add (in Taiwan or anywhere else) undoubtedly \nencounters cultural-historical artefacts (technologies) of different kinds along the way, as \nevery anthropologist would expect.  And of course it is important to stress that such \nartefacts were not always there, and instead have emerged or had salience during \nparticular historical moments.  For example, it happens that Mrs Chen is not a native \nMandarin speaker.  She speaks \u201cTaiwanese\u201d (i.e. the southern Min or \u201cHokkien\u201d dialect \nspoken by the majority of people in Taiwan thanks to the migration, several hundred \nyears ago, of their ancestors from Fujian).   This means that her earliest childhood \nexperience was in fact not of the numerical counting terms I have just described.  The \nsouthern Min dialect uses different terms, not to mention a different set of tones.   When \nMs Chen eventually went to elementary school, as she did for a few years, it happens that \nshe learned Mandarin counting terms (and was taught mathematics in Mandarin) because \nat that time the \u201cnational language\u201d was the basis for instruction.   But this too is down to \nTaiwan\u2019s  history.  If it had not been for the defeat of the Japanese (the colonisers of \nTaiwan between 1895 and 1945) in World War II, she might well have learned to count \nin Japanese!  And if the KMT had not managed to suppress the movement for Taiwanese \nindependence after the war, her schooling might have been in \u201cTaiwanese\u201d.  And so on. \n \nSimilarly, the evaluation of numerical knowledge and its artefacts must be seen \nhistorically.  This is a very complex topic, so let me focus here simply on one aspect of it.  \nI\u2019ve described the Chen\u2019s involvement in popular religion and their use of ritual and \ndivination as means of trying to understand, and sometimes manipulate, fate.  Their \nreligious practices draw heavily on popular versions of Chinese cosmologies which, as \nI\u2019ve said, are numerological in various senses.  However , as is well known, these \ncosmologies and religious practices came under heavy and sustained attack during the \n19th and 20th centuries precisely because they were held to be great mystifiers of the \ncommon people. Far from helping people grasp reality, they were held to be superstitions \nwhich had significantly contributed to the generally desperate condition of the Chinese \nnation.  In many quarters it was suggested that science (or to put it differently, the \nnumerical\/empirical logics of modern science, engineering and technology) would have \nto replace the mystifications of China\u2019s cultural heritage before China could be saved.   \nAs it happens, the implications of this ideological battle in Taiwan and China, and for \nreligious practice in both places \u2013 and, of course, for the Taiwanese and Chinese \nindividuals living at particular historical moments \u2013 have been strikingly different.   \n \n 9\nConclusion \n \nThe subject of mystification takes me back to the idea of the self as a centre of narrative \ngravity.  For Dennett, the self is a useful fiction, a work of the narrative imagination.  In \nwhich case, how is this ability to spin self-narratives actually enabled and constrained?  \nI\u2019ve been discussing this primarily as a psychological question.  But from a Marxian or \nDurkheimian (and, for that matter, Hegelian) perspective, one might of course ask how \nself-narration is constrained by the realities of history, including the history of our \nposition within a society and of our enculturation into a particular (historically \ndetermined) habitus.4  In short: how imaginative is it, really? \n \nFrom the evidence of her direct speech, the definitive story of Mrs Chen\u2019s life is closely \nrelated to three things.  First, there is her hard-won (albeit modest) success as a \nbusinesswoman.  While her husband went through a number of different careers, as I\u2019ve \nsaid, she stuck with one thing and very carefully saved all the income.  Second, there is \nher religious commitment as a devotee of certain deities and her membership, with her \nhusband, in a Taiwanese religious sect.  As a young mother, Mrs Chen became very \nseriously ill, and she and her husband now believe that she was saved only by their deep \nreligious faith, which continues to be a huge influence on their lives.  Third, there is the \nstrength of her family, and in particular the success of her son in Taiwan\u2019s highly \ncompetitive educational environment \u2013 something which has been made possible, in her \nview, precisely by her careful running of the family business and her deep religious \ncommitment.   Without wishing to belabour the point again, numerical conceptualisations \nlie behind all three of these aspects of her life: i.e. her economics, her religion, her \nkinship.   \n \nStill, all the main aspects of her life \u2013 her immersion in work, religion, family \u2013 can be \nconstrued as heavily shaped by the ideologies of modern Taiwanese capitalism, and by \nthe classic mystifications of Chinese religion and kinship. In fact, Mrs Chen could be said \nto be a textbook example of the Chinese mother who transforms her own exploitation at \nthe hands of patriarchal kinship into the reproduction (primarily through investments in \nher son) of this very same system (Sangren 2003).  And although she works for herself, it \ncould certainly be argued that Mrs Chen \u2013 as a very small trader from a poor background \nwithin Taiwan\u2019s economy \u2013 is simply party to her own self-exploitation.  This is made \nbearable, it could be said, by the mystifications of the religious practice into which she \nand her husband invest so much time, energy and money.  To put this differently: \nalthough Mrs Chen may be very happy with the trajectory of her life, this could be \ninterpreted merely as a symptom of the effectiveness of her indoctrination into a set of \n(self-exploitative) aspirations in the spheres of kinship, religion and economy.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Pierre Bourdieu (2000) and Ghassan Hage (2003) have both written very movingly on \nthe essentially Marxist question of what people can hope to make of their lives, given the \ncircumstances in which they live and the (socio-economic and ideological) constraints \nplaced upon them.   \n 10\nMost of my discussion, however, has implied that numerical knowledge of different kinds \nactually does help people to comprehend various realities, and to develop a picture of \nwhere they really stand in the scheme of things.  For Mrs Chen, this kind of \u201cself-\nknowledge\u201d might develop through arithmetic means such as reckoning price and value, \nor \u2013 in a rather more poetic sense \u2013 through her contemplation of folk cosmologies in \nwhich the fatefulness of her existence is rendered numerically.  \n \nOf course, whereas the former might be seen as a purely factual or \u201cscientific\u201d use of \nnumbers, intended to show how things really are, the latter, as I\u2019ve just noted, has been \nrepeatedly attacked in China and Taiwan as a means of hiding socio-economic realities.  \nIn fact, most of the people I\u2019ve known in rural China and Taiwan have seemed to hold a \nrather fuzzy distinction between what might be called \u201creligious\u201d and \u201cscientific\u201d uses of \nnumbers.  Obviously, they understand that, for example, school-based mathematics and \nnumerological divination are two very different things.  They know that religion is \nsupposed to be \u201csuperstition\u201d and that science is supposed to be truth.  And yet popular \nChinese cosmologies (which, again, tend towards the numerological) are felt to be \nrespectable in part because they are thought to be rigorously logical \u2013 they seek to \ndescribe, rather precisely, and through the use of calculation, the mechanics of the \nuniverse and the place of people within it.  They represent a naturalistic philosophy of a \nkind, and many people are attracted to this exactly because it seems equally scientific and \nreligious (or metaphysical).5 By extension, what a number is \u2013 for example, whether it is \na rigorously objective thing or a poetic one \u2013 seems to be unclear. This lack of \ndefinitional clarity (something we don\u2019t tend to associate with numbers) arguably makes \nnumerical artefacts particularly suitable as tools for imaginative projects in China.   \n \nIndeed, from a cognitive perspective, one of the striking things about the everyday \nexperiences of people like Mrs Chen is their ability to hold in mind, more or less \nsimultaneously, very different uses and meanings and evaluations of \u201cnumber\u201d.  One \nresult of this is that mundane numerical practices such as counting up, which seem to \nsimply represent objective reality as it is, may come to have a highly complex range of \nassociations \u2013 financial, poetic, religious, emotional.  And, as I\u2019ve been suggesting, they \nare one of the ways in which people like Mrs Chen begin to construct the fiction of the \nself.   \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBourdieu, P.  2000.
