Arden and Lockett\u2019s original investigations in 1913\ninvolved aerating sewage for several weeks before the treated liquor was allowed to settle and the\nsupernatant water was decanted (2). Therefore the very original activated sludge process was\noperated as a batch reactor and became known as the fill-and-draw process (3). A number of\nsequential treatment operations were repeated in order to treat the influent wastewater. A reactor\nwas filled with settled sewage and aerated for sufficient time to oxidise the majority of the BOD.\nFollowing this aeration period, the aeration was turned off and reactor contents were then allowed\nto settle so the activated sludge separated from the treated interstitial water. The treated\nsupernatant was subsequently discharged from the batch reactor. A portion of the settled sludge\nwas wasted and the whole process repeated again.\nThe development of continuous process quickly led to the abandonment of fill-and-draw systems\nand their associated operating difficulties (4). However, with the advent of microprocessor control\nusing programmable logic controllers, a modification of the original fill-and-draw process, known as\na sequencing batch reactor (SBR) has emerged as a successful alternative to continuous flow\nactivated sludge plants (3).\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nSequencing Batch Reactors are variable volume, non-steady state, suspended growth biological\nwastewater treatment reactors (5,6). Their treatment process is characterized by a repeated\ntreatment cycle consisting of a series of sequential process phases or events; FILL, REACT,\nSETTLE, DECANT, and IDLE. The main inter-cycle phase are described below, and illustrated in\nFigure 1 \u2013 SBR General Treatment Cycle Phases.\nFill\nThe FILL event is where the reactor is filled with wastewater between a low water level and a high\nwater level to provide a treatment batch. The influent wastewater is distributed into the retained\nsettled sludge. FILL can take place under mixed, unmixed, aerated or unaerated conditions (7).\nReact\nThe REACT phase starts once FILL is complete (8). It includes mixing and aeration. Aeration\nconditions serve to oxidise organic carbon, nitrify ammonia, and promote uptake of phosphorus in\nthe sludge. Unaerated conditions promote denitrification of nitrite and nitrate.\nSettle\nWhen the REACT phase ends, SETTLE begins. The SETTLE phase is when all the mixing and\naeration is turned off and the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) settle, allowing a clear\nsupernatant to form in the upper part of the SBR. The duration of SETTLE can be adjusted to\ncompensate for sludge settleability.\nDecant\nOnce SETTLE has been completed, the clarified liquid is withdrawn from the reactor and\ndischarged during DECANT. The DECANT phase occurs after a substantial depth of supernatant\nhas formed. Automatic valves open, and the supernatant is decanted from the upper portion of the\ntank.\nIdle\nThe IDLE phase is the buffering period between the end of DECANT, and prior to the reactor being\ncalled to FILL again at the start of the next cycle. The IDLE phase is an optional phase depending\non the design of the SBR. It can be eliminated when an influent balance tank, holding tank, or\nsome other method of handling excess flow is available (5). It can also be eliminated where two or\nmore reactors are used, and the reactors are operated with fixed cycle times.\nSludge wasting normally takes place after SETTLE as the MLSS will have reached its maximum\nsolids concentration, but can take place near the end of REACT, during SETTLE, during DECANT,\nor during IDLE, and can take place weekly, daily or during every cycle. In some variable-volume\nactivated sludge systems there is no distinct REACT phase, and SETTLE and DECANT occur\nwhile influent enters the system (5,9). In addition to the main inter-cycle phases described above,\ndepending on the desired level of treatment required, or the fill strategy utilised, a number of sub-\nphases can be operated. The cycle sub-phases are shown in Figure 2 \u2013 SBR Detailed Treatment\nCycle Phases, below.\nSBR DESIGN CRITERIA\nDomestic wastewater is subject to wide variations in flow and load. With the load on a treatment\nworks being dependent on two complimentary characteristics, the first being a quantitative\ncomponent which is a measure of the volume of sewage, and the second a qualitative component\nwhich is a measure of the impurity of strength of the sewage, both of which can fluctuate\nsignificantly (10). Therefore, the SBR has to be designed to cater for these variations. The process\ndesign of the SBR system is a function of the influent load, the volume of the reactor, the installed\naeration system, and the fraction of the overall cycle allowed for actual treatment steps. Whereas,\nhydraulically the design of the SBR is a function of the maximum rate of FILL versus the maximum\nrate of DECANT. The successful design of an SBR must meet the criteria for both process and\nhydraulic constraints at all stages throughout the cycle irrespective of the influent flow and load.\nTherefore, the SBR should be designed and operated with a control strategy that can achieve the\nrequirements of both the process and hydraulic considerations. An important and fundamental\nadvantage of an SBR system over a continuous flow system is the flexibility of the process. As the\nSBR process events are separated by time, rather than space. An operator can potentially modify\nthe duration and sequence of the different cycle events to achieve a desired process modification\n(7). Each event can be altered to fine-tune the overall treatment. In addition, the cycle period can be\nshortened or lengthened if necessary (8). However, this operational process flexibility has to be\ncarefully altered so not to compromise the hydraulic requirements of the system.\nThe limiting factor on the design of an SBR will depend on the influent flow and load, combined\nwith the quality of the discharge consent required. Typically an SBR treating wastewater flows up\nto 3 DWF that arise from a population contributing 180 l\/h\/d, 60 g\/h BOD\/d, and 7.5 g NH3-N\/d,\nand decanting 30% of the total basin volume per DECANT shall be hydraulically limited if the SBR\nhas to achieve carbonaceous treatment only. Whereas, an SBR required to achieve carbonaceous\ntreatment and full nitrification, shall be hydraulically limited when treating settled sewage, but\norganically limited when treating crude sewage.\nProcess Consideration\nThe process volume required to treat the wastewater is comparable to a continuous flow plant, i.e.\nmass of sludge, to treat mass of pollutant. However there are some important differences in the\nmanner that the process volume is calculated. Firstly, and the most obvious difference is that as an\nSBR operates as a batch process, the time available for biological treatment by aeration is a\npercentage of the overall treatment cycle. Also unlike continuous flow plants, SBR\u2019s operate with a\nvariable water level. The operational range will be between a low and high water level.\nThe capacity of each reactor below the design low water level is based on the volume needed to\naccommodate the process MLSS at the end of the DECANT phase of the cycle. The required\nbiological capacity shall be greater than this volume, and can be determined using similar design\nconsiderations to those used for a continuous flow process, such as the sludge loading rate (SLR),\nand the sludge age (11). However, SLR\u2019s cannot be applied directly as with continuous flow plants.\nThe SLR has to be adjusted for the percentage of the overall treatment cycle in which aeration is\npermitted. Therefore, although there will be the same oxygen demand as a continuous flow plant,\nthe air will have to be supplied in a shorter time period depending on the fraction of the cycle\nwhere aeration is permitted. Also, depending on the fill strategy, the aeration equipment has to\ntake into account the variable water level to ensure that desired oxygen transfer is always\nachieved.\nHydraulic Consideration\nOnce the biological process capacity has been established, the next stage in the design is to\ncheck that this volume does not conflict with the hydraulic requirements of the reactor. The volume\nbetween the design low water level and the top water level represents the hydraulic capacity of\neach reactor. Each reactor must have sufficient hydraulic batch capacity to treat the design flow to\nfull treatment (11).\nThe hydraulic consideration must ensure that the ability to move batches of water through the SBR\nsystem is always available. In doing this, the reactor must also be able to DECANT treated\nsupernatant under quiescent conditions to prevent settled sludge being entrained into the effluent\nstream. Failure to do so can result where the hydraulic consideration takes priority over the\nprocess consideration in order move water through the SBR treatment stream. If the net FILL rate\nexceeds the net DECANT rate for significant periods of time, the SBR must have the facility to\nstore or spill water. The hydraulic or batch capacity is a function of the FILL rate, the number of\nbasins in an SBR plant, the number of cycles per day, the DECANT rate, and the DECANT volume\ncompared with the total volume of a reactor. The hydraulic operation of an SBR with discontinuous\nFILL and DECANT events can be separated into two distinct control strategies:\n(1) Fill Control\n(i) Top Down Fill Strategy\n(ii) Bottom Up Fill Strategy\n(2) Cycle Time Control\n(i) Fixed Duration Cycle Times\n(ii) Flow Proportional Cycle Times\nThe operating strategy is a function of both process consideration and the hydraulic consideration\nand is affected by both the fill strategy, the control of the treatment cycle, and its individual phase\nevents within the cycle.\nFILL CONTROL STRATEGIES\nTop Down Control\nTop Down Control maximises the treatment capacity during the REACT period. The aim is to\nalways achieve the SBR basins top water level to maximise the treatment volume utilised during\nREACT. This is achieved by varying the bottom water depending on the influent flow rate. So the\noperational water level in the reactor is controlled from the top down. This control strategy is based\non a series of operational water levels, and can only be used for installations that employ a\nminimum of two reactors. The reactors are operated using the following operational levels:\n(1) High High Water Level (HHWL)\n(2) High Water Level (HWL),\n(3) Normal High Operating Level (NHOL)\n(4) Maximum Decant Level (MDL)\n(5) Normal Low Operating Level (NLOL)\n(6) Low Water Level (LWL)\nThe HHWL is a fixed level. The NHOL and the MDL are operator adjustable set points, and the\nHWL and the LWL are the actual levels achieved during operation. The NHOL is a calculated\nwater level under average flow conditions. The MDL is the maximum decant level down from the\nHHWL required to have the capacity to treat a full batch under maximum flow conditions. Under\naverage flow conditions the reactor will hunt around the NHOL. The control is based on feedback\nfrom the operational levels in the preceding reactor at the end of DECANT, and during FILL.\nThe decanter adjustment calculation steps are shown in Figure 3 \u2013 Two Basin SBR Using Top\nDown Control, and are described below:\n1. Store the decant level in the preceding reactor\n2. Measure the FILL level in the current basin and extrapolate to give actual HWL\n3. HWL \u2013 NHOL = Adjustment to DECANT\n4. 1-3 = New DECANT level\nAn example of the variation in NHOL is shown in Table 1 \u2013 Water Level Calculation. This variation\nis based on a typical diurnal variation described by Nicoll (1988) shown in Figure 4 \u2013 Typical\nDiurnal Variation in Flow. The downside of Top Down Control is that it because it is a feedback\ncontrol strategy it cannot deal with rapid changes in the influent flow rate. Where the variation in\nflow rate is relatively smooth, the NHOL is automatically adjusted and is maintained between the\nHHWL and the LWL. However, if there is a rapid increase in the FILL rate, the capacity between\nthe NHOL and the HHWL will be insufficient to accept a full batch, and flow will have to be spilled\nto maintain a continuous process. Therefore, because of this Top Down control is less appropriate\nfor domestic wastewater treatment where significant diurnal variations can be encountered.\nBottom Up Control\nBottom Up Control overcomes the shortcomings of Top Down Control, but in order to do so cannot\nmake as efficient use of the available treatment volume. Here the SBR\u2019s operational water level is\ncontrolled from the bottom up. The normal low operation level (NLOL) is fixed, and it is the normal\nhigh operational level (NHOL) that varies subject to the influent flow rate. However, to prevent\nwater spills, the NLOL is set such that there is always sufficient capacity to accept the maximum\ninfluent flow rate per batch. The downside of this operating strategy is that although any hydraulic\nvariation can be tolerated, the available treatment capacity is only fully utilised under maximum\ninfluent flow conditions.\nCYCLE TIME CONTROL STRATEGIES\nIt is not feasible to operate a batch activated sludge process under site conditions without an\nautomatic control system. The requirements of such a control system are that it should be reliable,\nsimple and easily understood by operators (4). A variety of controls strategies can be used that\ninclude; fixed; fixed step-change; load proportional; flow proportional; and fully dynamic flow and\nprocess proportional cycle times.\nFixed Duration Cycle Times\nThe simplest systems have fixed cycle times and the reactor is only filled at maximum flow (12).\nThe number of reactors affects the potential cycle length and dictates whether or not an influent\nbalance tank is required. Single reactor systems require an influent balance tank to store water\nduring the non-FILL events. Two reactor systems can operate without a balance tank if the FILL\nevent extends to half the total cycle length. As the number of reactors increase, the length of FILL\ncan be proportionally shortened. For example, a three-reactor system can be operated as a\ncontinuous FILL plant if the length of FILL is fixed at one third of the total cycle length. Figure 5 \u2013\nThree Basin SBR Using Fixed Cycle Times, illustrates a three basin SBR using fixed cycle times\nwith an overall cycle time of 360 minutes.\nIn this example, the duration of each FILL event is always 120 minutes, and the duration of the\nnon-FILL events is always 240 minutes. When the first reactor has completed its FILL event,\nautomatic valves simply direct the influent wastewater to the next reactor in sequence. Using\nBottom Up Control ensures that the SBR plant can always treat the influent flow rate.\nEven when using fixed cycle times, modifications can still be made to the duration of the different\ncycle events to achieve a desired process modification. Keeping with the above example, FILL can\nbe broken down into sub-cycles such as STATIC FILL and AERATED FILL, and the non-FILL\nevents can operate within a range with logical limits. The combined FILL event duration (sum of\ntimes for STATIC FILL and AERATE FILL) will always be 120 minutes. An operator could select\nthe desired STATIC FILL duration, and the AERATE FILL duration would be calculated by the\nPLC. Similarly, the duration of the remainder of the cycle (sum of durations for REACT, SETTLE,\nand DECANT) will always be 240 minutes. The operator could select the desired duration of\nSETTLE and DECANT, within recommended ranges, and the REACT time would be calculated by\nthe PLC. Figure 6 \u2013 Typical Three Basin SBR Cycle Ranges illustrates the range of inter-cycle\ntimes within a typical 360-minute cycle.\nWhen using fixed cycle times, dissolved oxygen (D.O.) control should be used to avoid over\naeration during periods of low organic and hydraulic loading. Also as the separate basins operate\nas discrete treatment reactors the overall cycle time should not be directly divisible into 24 hours.\nThis is to avoid the possibility of the same reactor always receiving a peak load compared with the\nother reactors. A variation of using fixed cycle times is where two modes of operation are used,\nwith a step change in cycle times, where shorter cycle times are used for high flows (9,12). This step\nchange can relate to the influent flow rate to the SBR system, or where an SBR system operates\nwith n-1 basins when a basin has been taken out of service for routine maintenance, or when a\nbasin has failed. For example, a three basin SBR system operating with a 360 minute total cycle\ntime can automatically switch over to operating as a two-basin SBR system with a 240-minute\ncycle time when a single basin is taken out of service. So even operating with fixed cycle times,\nprocess flexibility can be maintained.\nFlow Proportional Cycle Times\nMoving away from fixed cycle times increases the complexity of the control system required. For\ninstance, cycles can be operated where the basin fills completely at all flows above average flow.\nTo accommodate this, the cycle time has to be reduced inversely proportional to the influent flow\nrate. With variable cycle times the control system needs to look ahead and ensure that there is\nalways a basin ready to accept feed as required, this usually involves shortening the aeration\nprocess times as the flow increases (12). Reducing the cycle length inversely proportional to the\ninfluent flow rate only takes into account the treatment hydraulic consideration. The volume\navailable for treatment is more efficiently used compared to fixed cycle times, as the basins are\nfilled at all flows above average flow, and not just maximum flow conditions. However in shortening\nthe cycle time as flows rise above average flows only ensures that each reactor has sufficient\nhydraulic batch capacity to move the water through the SBR treatment stream.\nThe organic and hydraulic loading onto a treatment plant will vary with its catchment. The\ncatchment will be dynamic, depending on the type area served, whether it be; residential,\nindustrial, commercial, academic or tourist, and whether the catchment consists of separate or\ncombined sewers. For a combined sewer system serving a mixed catchment, flow in the sewer\nshall include a relative magnitude of foul sewage flow, and a relative magnitude of slow and fast\nresponse non-sewage inflow and infiltration [12]. The non-sewage inflow and infiltration will provide\na dilution rate for the total flow\/foul sewage flow.\nTherefore, at times of very low flow, the organic load will also be correspondingly low. During these\ntimes the REACT period can also be shortened accordingly. So under theoretical catchment\nconditions, as the hydraulic loading increases up from zero, the organic loading will increase\ncorrespondingly. Excluding flash storms, the normal peak pollutant strengths should correspond\napproximately with normal average flow conditions. Flows above average conditions shall be\nprogressively diluted through non-sewage inflow and infiltration. Therefore as the influent flow rate\nincreases up from zero, the volume of reactor required to treat the influent sewage will increase up\nto a maximum, at which point the non-sewage inflow and infiltration progressively dilutes the\ninfluent sewage strength. This dilution will result in a reduced influent strength, and subsequent\nreduced batch load. Figure 7 illustrates the variation in cycle times with increasing flow rate.\nInitially REACT will be based on the minimum aeration required for maintenance air to cover\nendogenous respiration. Then, as the flow increases, the length of REACT increases up to a\nmaximum, then AERATE FILL increases up to a maximum at 100% design flow. As the flow\nincreases above 100% design flow, the length of REACT is progressively reduced as the influent\nstrength is diluted.\nThere are a number of methods to achieve proportional control strategies that take into\nconsideration both the process and hydraulic requirements of operating an SBR using dynamic\nmathematical models, fuzzy logic, or control programmes (14,15). Yoo et al (2004) described the\napplication of multiway independent component analysis (MICA) to monitor the performance of the\nSBR process (16). Hua et al (2004) described a cascade closed-loop control strategy for the\noptimisation for batch reactors (17). Pavselj et al (2001) described an experimental design of an\noptimal phase duration control strategy using a control algorithm using indirect process variables\n(18). Whereas, Eco Process and U.S. Filter both supply propriety flow proportional control systems\nfor SBR\u2019s (6,19).\nEco Process\u2019s BioLogTM is an exhausted flow control strategy developed into a software program\nto operate the process sequence in a viable manner to keep the biological treatment performance\noptimum while managing all flow variations. The program was developed by Eco Process and can\naccept and manage continuous or hourly peak flow periods reaching over 5 times the average flow\ncondition of a plant. USFilter\u2019s OMNIFLO\uf0e2 System provides precise process control over a wide\nrange of flows. The microprocessor control system operates on a timed \u2018batch proportional\u2019\nprogram at low flows and a \u2018flow proportional\u2019 program at average and peak flows (6,20).\nDISCUSSION\nFlow Proportional Cycle Times\nThe control strategy can be based on the identification of the endpoint after biological reaction.\nSwitching to the next phase shortly after the detection of the reaction endpoint provides an\noptimum solution for both the process performance and the economies of the plant (16). This type\nof control will give rise to flow and load proportional cycle times. Flow proportional cycle times\nallow for better utilisation of a treatment reactor compared to fixed cycle times. However, the flow\nproportional cycles are far more complex than the fixed cycle times, and must ensure that there is\nno conflict between the process and hydraulic requirements of the SBR. USFilters\u2019 OMNIFO\uf0e2\nsystem that uses a timed batch proportional program at low flows and a flow proportional program\nat average and peak flows is effectively a three-tier control strategy. The timed batch proportional\nprogram takes care of the treatment process at low flows. The flow proportional program takes\ncare of the process and hydraulic considerations at higher flows. The process consideration should\ntake care of all treatment operations under normal conditions. With the hydraulic consideration\ninteracting with the process consideration, adjusting cycle lengths inversely proportional to the\ninfluent flow rate at flows above 100% design flow. The third-tier is an emergency hydraulic\nwatchdog, which will only be called to operate under certain circumstances to ensure that the\nhydraulic batch can be moved through the treatment stream. The cycle times should be set up and\noperated using the timer based program, and the flow proportional process and hydraulic\nconsiderations via control set points. Under normal operation the hydraulic watchdog should not be\ncalled to operate.\nProcess Consideration\nThe aim of the process consideration is to supply sufficient air for biological treatment and provide\nconditions to achieve of a good settling sludge. Under normal conditions the process consideration\nhas priority over the hydraulic consideration. At the initial design stage, the volume of the reactor is\nsized taking into account the fraction of the cycle in which aeration is permitted. The aeration\nperiod can be extended throughout the FILL and REACT events. Therefore, in a 360-minute cycle\nit may be possible to extend the aeration period up to about 300 minutes. However, under design\nconditions the target aeration period will be limited to about 50% of the total cycle time. The\nOMNIFLO\uf0e2 control system normally operates in the range of 60 to 140 minutes in a total cycle of\n360 minutes (21), a range of 17 to 38% of the total cycle time. 17% is minimum aeration for\nendogenous respiration. 38% is the target aeration period for maximum aeration. The process\nrequirements are set up using a number of set points. The typical process set points for a flow\nproportional SBR are shown in Figure 8, below:\nHydraulic Consideration\nThe aim of the hydraulic consideration is to ensure that hydraulic batches can be moved through\nthe treatment stream without stopping the treatment process or flooding the reactor. Under normal\noperation with flows less than 100% design flow the hydraulic consideration will not be called to\ninteract with the process consideration. With flows over 100% design flow, the flow proportional\nprogram will ensure that that basins are ready to accept sequential FILLS to maintain a continuous\n\u2018batch\u2019 process. The hydraulic consideration includes a hydraulic \u2018watchdog\u2019 that may override the\ncalculated cycle times under circumstances where either the set points are not balanced, or where\nrapid rates of change in the influent flow rate are encountered. The typical hydraulic set points are\nshown in Figure 9, below:\nThe hydraulic set points are far simpler than the process set points, as they are only concerned\nwith passing a volume of water through a batch. However, there is direct interaction between the\nhydraulic and process set points. For instance, the Max Fill set point will have an affect on the\noverall cycle time, and thus place a constraint on the time available for non-FILL events, before an\nactive basin has to be ready again to accept its next FILL. Under normal operation the time to top\nwater level (T2TWL) is monitored during FILL, and sets whether or not the design flow is above\n100%. If the TWL is not reached during FILL, timers control the SBR operation.\nCalculation of Cycle Time\nWhere flow proportional control is used, the calculation of the total cycle time is critical to the\ncontinuous operation of an SBR. One of the key aspects is \u2018basin ready\u2019 time. This is the time\nbetween a basin finishing FILL and going into REACT and when it will be called to subsequently\nFILL again. The steady-state calculation for basin ready time is simply (Number of basins (n) - 1) x\nMax Fill Time. This gives the time required to complete all non-FILL events before that basin is\ncalled to FILL again. At 100% design flow, the T2TWL should correspond with the Max Fill set\npoint. The Max Fill set point constrains the FILL period, to enable the \u2018basin ready\u2019 time to be\ncalculated. If flows are less than 100% design flow, FILL will time out at the Max Fill set point. If\nflows are in excess of 100% design flow, FILL will be terminated on reaching TWL. In conjunction\nwith the flow proportional program, the time taken for FILL sets the time available for non-FILL\nevents, and predicts the basin ready time. However, in practice the influent flow is not steady state,\nand the cycle times are adjusted inversely proportional to the influent. There are certain milestones\nin the calculation process. For instance, the aeration period is calculated and fixed at the end of\nFILL. So once FILL has ended the \u2018basin ready\u2019 time cannot be further adjusted. As the influent\nflow is dynamic and still may change significantly after the aeration period has been calculated,\nthere has to be a buffer period to absorb these changes. This buffer period is built into the\ntreatment cycle as the IDLE period. If the rate of change is such that there is insufficient IDLE\ncapacity, the hydraulic watchdog will operate based on the T2TWL and force either FILL DECANT\nor FILL SETTLE events to maintain hydraulic throughput through the SBR. Depending on the flow\nconditions, three levels of control operate:\n(1) Time based treatment operations, with set points:\nMax Fill\nMax Air\nMin React\nSettle\n& hard coded Decant Time\n(2) Flow proportional process and hydraulic treatment operations, with set points\nFlow Sample\nAnoxic Multiplier\nMax Anoxic Time\nSettle Safety\nMax Decant\nDecant Fall\n& hard coded Design Flow\n(3) T2TWL hydraulic watchdog\nThe cycle time is ultimately a function of the timer based operations, and the flow proportional\nprocess and hydraulic treatment operations, under a variety of flow conditions. The hydraulic\nwatchdog is only used to maintain hydraulic throughput in exceptional circumstances. Table 2\nillustrates a typical cycle time calculation.\nFrom the table, it can be seen that at 100% design flow, there is 120 minutes available for REACT,\nso with a Max Air set point of 114 minutes, there will always be sufficient air time. Therefore\nREACT will always be terminated on the Max Air set point, i.e. the treatment cycle shall be\ncontrolled by batch timers, and the process consideration shall not be required to operate.\nWhereas, at flows above the design flow, only 52 minutes is available for REACT, and with a FILL\ntime of only 43 minutes, the Max Air set point of 114 minutes cannot be achieved even if aeration\ntime is forced into FILL as AERATE FILL. As it cannot be achieved, the Max Air set point is not\nbalanced for conditions where maximum flow is encountered. Table 3 shows the effects of\nadjusting the set point to allow the treatment conditions to be met.\nFrom the table, it can be seen again, that at flow up to 100% design flow, there is still 120 minutes\navailable for REACT, so there will always be sufficient air time. Therefore like the above example,\nREACT will always be terminated on the Max Air set point. At maximum flow, only 52 minutes is\navailable for REACT. So with a Max Air set point of 82 minutes, to achieve the set point, the\nprocess consideration will operate to force 30 minutes of aeration into FILL as AERATED FILL.\nThe OMNIFLO\uf0e2 control system\u2019 achieves this through the calculation of the ANOXIC FILL\nduration. The control of this anoxic time is derived from several factors and set points. The main\nfactor is a propriety substrate utilisation curve derived by Jet-tech that is based on substrate\nutilisation under anoxic conditions. This has been calculated as the ideal relationship of the\nincoming flow and load to the amount of anoxic time required to promote ideal selection pressures\nfor non-filamentous organisms to give rise to a rapid settling sludge (22,23,24). The set points that\naffect this are:\n(1) Max Anoxic Fill\n(2) Max Fill Time\n(3) Anoxic Fill Multiplier\nFigure 10 Illustrates the substrate utilisation curve developed by USFilter\/Jet-Tech. The Max\nAnoxic Fill can be shorter than the Max Fill set point to prevent excessively long anoxic periods\nunder certain flow conditions. The Max Fill sets the time out limit of FILL. The Anoxic Fill Multiplier\nis used to calculate minutes of ANOXIC FILL. At flows greater than 100% design flow, the process\nconsideration will override the batch timer program, with the anoxic multiplier having priority over\nthe timer-based program. Therefore, it is essential that the set points should be balanced with\neach other.\nBalancing Set Points\nThe set points have to in balance with each other to avoid conflicts between the process and\nhydraulic considerations used by the control software. As the SBR process is a continuous cycle,\neach set point potentially affects another set point (25). The anoxic multiplier is a process\nconsideration, which takes priority over the timer-based program. The multiplier offsets the above\ncurve to calculate the required minutes of ANOXIC FILL to achieve a good settling sludge. As the\nanoxic multiplier acts first, it is essential that it be balanced with the Max Air Time, to avoid eating\ninto the required aeration time. The OMNIFO\uf0e2 control system uses an anoxic time of 112 minutes\nat 100% design flow [14]. Therefore a multiple of this value is used to calculate an anoxic time that\ncorresponds with the overall aeration requirement and the time available for REACT. In the above\nexample, given a FILL period of 43 minutes, of which 13 minutes needs to be anoxic, the anoxic\nmultiplier shall be 13 \uf0b8 112 = 0.12.\nSummer & Winter Set Points\nAs mentioned previously, when using fixed cycle times, a variation of that type of control is where\ntwo modes of operation are used. There are step changes in cycle times, where shorter cycle\ntimes are used for high flows. These can also be referred to as \u2018summer\u2019 and \u2018winter\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019\nand \u2018storm\u2019 cycle times (26). These step changes are used to try and use the treatment volume as\nefficiently as possible over a wide range of flows. The same problem is still encountered even\nwhen using flow proportional cycle times. In making sure that the set points are balanced, the\ncycle times have to be effectively shortened by reducing the Max Air set point. In doing so will\nensure that there are no set point conflicts, but introduces the risk of not being able to provide\nsufficient aeration for biological treatment.\nFill Decant\nExtending the Max Air set point can eliminate the risk of insufficient aeration. However, doing this\nalso extends the overall length of the treatment cycle, and increases the \u2018basin ready\u2019 time. Under\nconditions where the influent flow undergoes a significant rate of change, there a risk that the IDLE\nbuffer period is insufficient, and a basin will not ready in time to accept its next FILL. If this situation\ndoes occur, the control system will divert the influent flow to the most advanced basin in its cycle,\nand it will have to take the flow. Under these circumstances it is possible that either a FILL\nDECANT, or a FILL SETTLE event will occur. The Settle Safety set point is used as a hydraulic\nconsideration to try and avoid FILL DECANTS occurring. The Anoxic Multiplier set point is used to\navoid a FILL SETTLE (21).\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. The design of SBR\u2019s must consider both the process requirement to treat the organic load, and\nthe hydraulic requirement to enable throughput of water through the treatment stream.\n2. SBR\u2019s can operate with either Top Down or Bottom Up fill strategies. However where variable\nflows are encountered, Top Down control is not suitable.\n3. SBR\u2019s can be operated with either fixed-cycle or flow-proportional cycles in order to treat a\nvariable flow.\n4. An operating strategy using flow proportional cycle times uses the treatment volume more\nefficiently than fixed cycle times.\n5. Flow proportional process and hydraulic control strategies offer the most complex control\nstrategies, but enable the treatment to automatically adjust to match the flow and load.\n6. When using flow proportional software, operational set points must be balanced to avoid\nconflicts between the process and hydraulic considerations.\n7. Under certain flow and load conditions, either all the process requirements, or all the hydraulic\nrequirements cannot be met. Where a long aeration period is required, it may not be possible\nto operate the SBR without the hydraulic watchdog having to truncate cycle times and force\nFILL DECANT events.\n8. FILL DECANT events can be avoided using design flow or \u2018winter\u2019 set points. These ensure\nthat the plant will always operate within the timer-based program, and the flow proportional\nprocess and hydraulic program, without the hydraulic watchdog being called to operate.\nHowever, in avoiding FILL DECANT, the aeration period, set by the Max Air set point may not\nbe sufficient for biological treatment.\n9. Where variable treatment cycles are used to treat variable flows, irrespective of the control\nstrategy used; dynamic mathematical models; fuzzy logic; control programmes, etc, the control\nsystem must use a hydraulic watchdog to ensure that hydraulic continuity can always be\nmaintained throughout a batch treatment process, otherwise flow attenuation or storage\nvolume must be provided to absorb rapid rates of change in the influent flow rate.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe opinions expressed in this report are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of Gleeson Construction Services Limited, Wessex Water Limited, or Cranfield University.\nREFERENCES\n1.
