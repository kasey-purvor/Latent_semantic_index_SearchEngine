INTRODUCTION\nT O-DATE, several approaches have been explored toaddress cross-regulation, complexity, and overall circuit\nperformance issues of multioutput converters, the solutions\nbeing divided into three distinct categories. The first regulates\na single primary output using closed-loop feedback, with the\nauxiliary outputs being semi-regulated and, therefore, sub-\nject to cross-regulation error. The second category achieves\nprecise post-regulation of each output by using either linear\nregulators or hard-switched dc\u2013dc converters. However, such\ncircuits are rarely used in practice due to cost constraints.\nThe third category is specific to applications which require\nonly two regulated outputs, as is commonly found in signal\nprocessing and microprocessor based systems. They avoid the\nneed for post-regulation by utilizing two closed-loop feedback\nconfigurations. A third-order converter [1], [2] with two\nindependently controlled outputs has been previously reported\nin [1]. However, optimum performance characteristics were not\nforthcoming, primarily due to the significant complexity asso-\nciated with the highly nonlinear behavior between the various\noutputs as a function of load. Nevertheless, it is a solution that\nbroadly falls within this third category that is the subject of\nthis paper. Specifically, dual-output resonant converters\n[3]\u2013[8], are considered, with control of each output being\nachieved by switching the power devices asymmetrically over\neach half switching cycle using a combination of pulsewidth\nmodulation (PWM) and frequency control.\nManuscript received July 6, 2007; revised November 19, 2007.

DUAL O\/P -SPRC MODEL\nA half-bridge -SPRC with two outputs is shown in\nFig. 1(a). To achieve zero-voltage switching, the converter is\nassumed to operate on the negative gradient of the input-output\nfrequency characteristic, above the primary resonant peak.\nWhen operating in this region, the resulting waveforms can be\nsub-divided into three distinct modes per half cycle viz. M1,\nM2, and M3, depicted in Fig. 1(c)\u2013(e).\nIn the analysis that follows in this section it is assumed that\n1) output filter capacitors and are infinite in value and\ntherefore and are ripple free, 2) the resonant cir-\ncuit input current (also shown in Fig. 1(b) as ) can be conve-\nniently represented as a sinusoid owing to the band-pass filter\ncharacteristics of the tank circuit, 3) all switches (inc. diodes)\nare ideal and thus commutate instantaneously and possess zero\non-state voltage drop, 4) the transformer leakages are negligible\n(i.e., 0), and 5) the parallel resonant capacitors are\nequal in value.\nCircuit Mode M1 . At the start of M1,\nSW2 is turned off at and SW1 turned on. The series in-\nductor current, [shown as in Fig. 1(b)], is negative\nand flows through the internal diode of SW1, thereby fa-\ncilitating ZVS of SW1. Also during this period, allows\nD2 to conduct and transfer energy to support , while\nthe voltage on is clamped to . All the rectifier\ncurrent, therefore, flows to the load. At the end of M1, the\nrectifier current has decayed to zero, and both the high\nside and low side diodes, and the output filter, are effec-\ntively decoupled from the resonant tank.\nCircuit Mode M2 . Here, the series reso-\nnant inductor current becomes positive. Since SW1 is\nturned on during M1, current flow is now through SW1.\nInitial conditions for this mode are that 0 and\n. The inductor current and parallel\nresonant capacitor voltages take on a sinusoidal character-\nistic. Since the outputs are effectively disconnected from\nthe tank, both and contribute to resonant behavior.\nBoth rectifier currents are zero, and the converter outputs\nare in an \u2019idle\u2019 state, with energy being supplied solely by\nthe charge on the filter capacitors. By initially neglecting\nthe rectifier on-state voltage, and noting that the effective\nparallel resonant capacitance is the sum of the parallel\nresonant capacitors and , during the capac-\nitor charging period is described by\n(1)\n0885-8993\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nBINGHAM et al.: ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF DUAL-OUTPUT RESONANT CONVERTERS 1725\nFig. 1.

At D1 be-\ncomes forward biased, since and D2 is still\nreverse biased. The rectifier diode current remains zero\nthroughout the duration of M3, and D1 clamps the capac-\nitor voltage until decays to zero, at which\ntime the second half cycle of operation commences.\nFor 50% duty-cycle excitation, the second half-cycle of op-\neration is the mirror image of the first. However, for asymmet-\nrical excitation, the output rectifier diode (D2) nonconduction\nangle, associated with the series resonant inductor current being\nof negative polarity, is given by\n(4)\nwhere . The voltage, , across the parallel\nresonant capacitor can, therefore, be expressed as a function of\nthe angle [see Fig. 1(b)], see (5), shown at the bottom of the\nnext page.\n1726 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nUnder steady-state conditions, the mean output current ,\nflowing through D1 towards the output filter and load, can be\ndetermined from the mean current flowing through the rectifier\nwhen it is of positive polarity.

STATE-VARIABLE ANALYSIS\nIn this section a state-variable model of the dual-output con-\nverter is derived which is suitable for both steady-state and tran-\nsient analysis of the converter. To commence the analysis the\ndynamics of the converters are separated into \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d\nsub-systems, with their interaction related by a set of coupling\nequations. The fast sub-system is considered to describe the dy-\nnamics of the resonant tank and power switches\n(11)\nwith the slow sub-system describing the output filter dynamics\n(12)\nAs discussed, during interval [see Fig. 1(b) and (d)]\nis clamped to during the positive half-cycle, and con-\nversely, to during the negative half-cycle, due to the ac-\ntion of the diodes. By noting that there will be negligible cur-\nrent flowing through during these periods, the rectifier input\nvoltage is dependent on the direction of the current leaving the\nresonant tank inductances, i.e., . The relevant\ncoupling terms are, therefore, obtained by equating voltages at\neither side of the rectifier for each respective half-cycle\n(13)\nAssuming a constant rectifier voltage drop, (12) can be ma-\nnipulated to give\n(14)\nConsidering the rectifier current, , to be zero during the\npositive half-cycle of the parallel capacitor voltage, the rectifier\ncurrent , is given from\n(15)\nfor\nfor\nfor\nfor\n(5)\n \nBINGHAM et al.: ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF DUAL-OUTPUT RESONANT CONVERTERS 1727\nThis leads to the following coupling equations which describe\nthe rectifier currents within each half of a switching cycle, see\n(16), shown at the bottom of the page.\nNotably, the voltage across can be considered a reflection\nof the voltages across and , and the state vector for\nthe parallel inductor current in the fast sub-system [see (11)]\nsimplifies to . The state-variable equations for the\nparallel resonant capacitor voltage (11) can be simplified to\n(17)\nThe complete state-variable model of the dual load converter\nis, therefore, given by\n(18)\nwhere\n(19)\nBy way of example, the aforementioned model has been\nimplemented in the Matlab\/Simulink simulation environment\nand employed to generate steady-state control to output voltage\nresponse for the candidate converter given in Table I with a\n30 V dc-link voltage. A plot of the resulting steady-state output\nvoltage characteristics of the converter, and , as a\nfunction of switching frequency and duty-cycle ratio is given\nin Fig. 2. It is evident that for operation above resonance, the\nsum of the output voltages applied to the loads increases as the\noperating frequency tends to the effective resonant frequency,\nfor fixed values of duty-cycle ratio. Furthermore, for a 50%\nduty-cycle, giving symmetric square-wave excitation of the\ntank, the converter delivers identical voltages to both the high\nside and low side outputs, for a fixed operating frequency,\nas expected. For a given operating frequency, a decrease in\nthe duty-cycle ratio, from 50%, is seen to deliver more en-\nergy from the resonant tank to energize output , thereby\nyielding a correspondingly higher output voltage and power,\nand vice-versa. It is, therefore, clear that for balanced loads,\nFig. 2. Variation of output voltage distribution with switching frequency and\nduty-cycle ratio.\nTABLE I\nCONVERTER MODEL PARAMETERS\nthe voltage and power distribution to each output can be in-\ndependently influenced by a suitable choice of duty ratio and\nswitching frequency.\nFig. 3(a) also shows the ratio of the two output voltages, as\na function of duty and load quality factor, . It can be seen\nthat the slope of the characteristic is relatively independent of\nthe quality factor, for high , although the attainable differ-\nence between the output voltages is seen to be greater for low\nvalues of load quality factor. Hence, operation with a low\nshould be chosen to facilitate large output voltage differences,\nas opposed to the use of high to facilitate sinusoidal tank\ncurrents and voltages.\nSince it is instructive to show the impact of converter parame-\nters on the attainable output voltage ratio, Fig. 3(b) demonstrates\nhow the output voltage ratio varies, as a function of duty ratio,\nas the resonant capacitance ratio is varied. It can be seen,\nin particular, that the slope of the characteristic is greater for\nlow values of . Hence, it is usual to choose a low value for\nduring the design phase. However, such a choice means the\ninput-output voltage characteristic exhibits a reduced resonant\npeak, and consequently, the voltage boosting capability of the\nfor\nfor\nfor\nfor\n(16)\n1728 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nFig. 3. Dual output converter characteristics as a function of (a) duty-cycle\nratio and Q as design parameters and (b) duty-cycle ratio and C as design\nparameters.\nconverter is limited [2], [9]\u2013[13]. Furthermore, the input-output\nvoltage conversion ratio at the effective resonant frequency of\nthe tank, is consequently lower. Such converters, therefore, are\nmore suitable for step-down dc\u2013dc applications.\nAgain, by way of example, Fig. 4 shows the variation of the\nphase difference, , between the input voltage and input cur-\nrent for the converter whose parameters are given in Table I,\nwith the normalized switching frequency (where\n) and the input voltage duty-cycle ratio. It can be\nseen that, at frequencies less than the tank resonant frequency,\nthe input impedance of the tank network is dominated by\nthe tank capacitance. Hence, the fundamental component of the\ninput switch current leads the input voltage, and the resonant\ntank presents a load which is effectively capacitive. This pro-\nvides zero current switching (ZCS) for 0. However,\nwhen the resonant converter is operated above resonance the\ntank effectively presents an inductive load to the power devices,\nand the switch current lags the switch voltage, thereby facili-\ntating zero voltage switching (ZVS).\nThe boundary condition i.e., the minimum phase angle\nthat provides ZVS needs to be determined to constrain the\nexcitation of the converter. At the effective resonant frequency,\nFig. 4. Phase difference \u0001\f versus normalized switching frequency and\nduty-cycle ratio.\nFig. 5. Waveforms of input voltage V , resonant circuit fundamental input\nvoltage v , and series inductor current i at (a) D = 0.5(\u0001\f = \f )\nand (b) D = 0.3(\u0001\f < \f ).\nunder asymmetric square-wave input voltage excitation, the\ninput voltage lags the fundamental of the input current, i.e.,\n0 when the duty-cycle falls below 50%, as will be seen\nin Fig. 5. The condition for inductive mode conduction, under\nasymmetric conditions, can, therefore, be expressed as\n(20)\nwhere is the phase angle between the actual square input\nvoltage waveform and fundamental of the input current; is\nthe phase lag between the first harmonic of the input voltage and\ncurrent; and is the phase of the fundamental frequency\ncomponent of the input voltage, . It will be noted that\n0 at resonance, and 0 above resonance, which implies that\nthe fundamental of the input voltage leads that of the current.\nFor asymmetric operation of the converter, the duties of SW1\nand SW2 are now denoted, respectively, by D and 1-D, where\nD is the ratio of the turn-on period with respect to the switching\nperiod. Asymmetric switching therefore provides an asymmet-\nrical voltage, , to excite the tank, of amplitude :\n(21)\nAssuming that only the fundamental component ex-\ncites the resonant tank, and applying the relationship\n, the fundamental of\nthe input voltage, , and its phase angle, are given\nBINGHAM et al.: ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF DUAL-OUTPUT RESONANT CONVERTERS 1729\nFig. 6. Boundary condition and critical frequency to preserve ZVS.\nby\n(22)\nThe condition for inductive switching can now be re-written\nas , which is obtained by increasing the\nswitching frequency. However, this imparts higher circulating\ncurrents that increase conduction losses contributing to thermal\nproblems. Increasing the switching frequency also compromises\nthe ability of the converter to deliver large differences in the dual\noutput voltages. Ideally, therefore, the converter should be oper-\nated at the minimum switching frequency, above resonance, that\ncan achieve ZVS. The minimum frequency which is allowed is\nreferred to as the critical frequency, . To preserve ZVS, as D\nis decreased, the required critical frequency moves away from\nthe resonant frequency, as illustrated in Fig. 6.\nIV. IMPACT OF OUTPUT LEAKAGE INDUCTANCE\nAlthough resonant converters are often designed to operate at\nrelatively high frequencies, typically in the 200\u2013500 kHz range,\ndesigners must still consider the impact of low levels of leakage\ninductance on converter performance. This is particularly evi-\ndent for converters with multiple outputs, where the presence of\nsuch effects significantly complicates the analysis, particularly\nwhen determining the state of the parallel resonant inductor cur-\nrent, , since the voltage seen across cannot be assumed to\nbe directly related to , as a result of the voltages across the\nleakage inductances, and that are inherently present\nin the transformer. To predict how and will affect the\noperation of the converter, the model must be augmented with\nto allow a solution for . Once again, the converter can\nbe partitioned into fast and slow sub-systems, Fig. 7 showing\na model of the resonant converter \u201cfast\u201d sub-system. While the\nrectifier is omitted in the state-variable representation, its influ-\nence on the fast sub-system is accommodated through the ad-\ndition of current sources, as shown in Fig. 7. This step is jus-\ntified by noting that the interaction between the fast and slow\nsub-systems is solely based on coupling equations consisting of\nFig. 7. State-variable representation of the fast sub-system.\nTABLE II\nPROTOTYPE DUAL OUTPUT CONVERTER COMPONENT VALUES\nthe characteristics of the rectifier output currents and .\nThe slow sub-system describes the behavior of the high side and\nlow side rectifier outputs and the capacitive output filters and\nloads, and being considered to be the inputs to the\nhigh side and low side output sub-systems, respectively.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nMeasured results have been obtained on an experimental con-\nverter with a step-down capability, the measured component\nvalues being given in Table II. A ferrite core, 3F3, suitable for\nhigh frequency applications, was used for both the transformer\ncore and the resonant inductor. Since the transformer leakage in-\nductances are dependent on the winding arrangement, the sec-\nondaries were bifilar wound adjacent to the core, beneath the\nprimary winding, so as to reduce secondary leakage flux.\nThe parallel resonant inductor is designed to be on the\ntransformer primary side, such that utilizes the magnetizing\ninductance, , of the transformer. The effective series in-\nductance comprises of the series inductor, , and the primary\nleakage inductance, , and was measured as 1.55 H. A\ncomparison of the output voltage obtained from the state vari-\nable model, simulated to steady-state, with SPICE simulation\nresults and measurements, is given in Fig. 8. As can clearly be\nseen from a comparison of Fig. 8(a) and (b), the correlation\nbetween the theoretical predictions and the experimental data\nis significantly improved when the effect of leakage inductance\nis incorporated within the model.\nVI. CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL\nThe structure of the control methodology, which employs two\ndecoupled feedback loops for independent control of frequency\nand duty-cycle ratio, is shown in Fig. 9. Parameters for the de-\ncoupled SISO controllers are chosen for good transient response\nand disturbance rejection. The digital compensator is tuned to\nrespond quickly to variations of using frequency control,\nwhile the controller reacting to variations of (duty control)\nacts relatively slowly, thereby allowing an effective decoupling\nof the control loops, for simplicity. The prototype converter con-\ntroller is shown in Fig. 10. The converter (see Table II for pa-\nrameters) is required to provide regulated 5 V and 3.3 V\noutputs from a dc link input voltage in the range 15 to 20 V.\nFig. 11 shows the steady-state error between the reference volt-\nages, and , and the resulting measured output voltages\nof the converter, over the specified range of dc link input volt-\nages (15 to 20 V) with a 5 load connected to each output. It\ncan be seen that the maximum regulation error for both outputs\nis .\nFinally, Fig. 12 shows the response of the converter resulting\nfrom transient startup conditions, for a range of applied input\n1732 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 4, JULY 2008\nvoltages and dual output voltage ratios. It can be seen that the\nconverter voltages converge rapidly to the reference values, with\nan initial overshoot of , corresponding to an equivalent\nsecond-order damping ratio of 0.6.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe characteristics of dual-load, fourth-order\nvoltage-output resonant converters, have been explored. From\nthe output voltage distribution derived from an example con-\nverter, the impact of the converter design parameters, and\noutput leakage inductance, on the attainable output voltage\nratio, has been investigated. A comparison of measurements\nfrom an experimental converter, capable of delivering 5 V\nand 3.3 V, with predictions from the derived state-variable\nmodel and SPICE simulations, shows that the state-variable\nmodel provides accurate predictions of output voltage under\nsteady-state conditions. Moreover, a basic control scheme to\nallow reliable regulation of both outputs, has been realized, with\nsteady-state measurements showing independent regulation\nusing a combination of duty-cycle and frequency control, and\ngood startup transient behavior on both outputs under a range\nof operating conditions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
