A further\ndifficulty that arises is that most of the power output from the\nwide-band pulsed source occurs at frequencies (e.g., 1\u20133 THz)\nwhere waveguides designed for lower frequencies can support\na number of modes. At frequencies where multimoded prop-\nagation can occur, a meaningful analysis is only possible if\nthe extent to which each waveguide mode has been excited\nis known. Finally, the power output of the source over the\nsingle-moded bandwidth of the waveguide is often rather low,\nleading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio in each frequency bin of\nthe complex insertion loss function.\nIn this paper, the problems associated with poor\nsignal-to-noise ratio and multimoded propagation are ad-\ndressed by placing the waveguide characterization problem in a\nsystem identification framework. We introduce autoregressive\nand state-space models as efficient modeling tools of linear\nprocesses such as energy dissipation in a waveguide test\npiece. These tools, however, require low-noise data sets,\nwhich might not be realizable within practical integration time\nscales. Wavelet pre-filtering is well suited to the denoising\nof the nonstationary data sets obtained in terahertz transient\nspectrometry [1]\u2013[3]. Since the commonly used wavelets such\nas the family are not necessarily optimal in describing\nan experimental data set, we introduce a process for tailoring\nthe wavelet transform to the signal to be analyzed in order to\nmaximize the amount of energy in the wavelet coefficients\nkept in the filtering process. The algorithm is then used to\nprocess terahertz transient reflection signatures from a WR-8\nadjustable waveguide short. The identification models provide\nthe weights and attenuation for each mode propagating in the\nstructure. Pole-zero diagrams are used to show the effect of\nfiltering on the calculated mode parameters.\nII.

The signals are vertically offset for better\nvisualization.\nlaser producing optical pulses with durations of 140 fs is used\nto resonantly excite the lowest interband transitions of an In-\nGaAs emitter, which is located at the focal point of a parabolic\nreflector [4]\u2013[6]. The optical pulse generates an electron\u2013hole\nplasma and the accelerated carriers generate a pulse of terahertz\nradiation that is horizontally polarized along the direction of the\nsurface field of the InGaAs emitter. Terahertz pulses emitted by\nthe photoconductive element are transmitted through a vertical\ngrid and the propagating terahertz beam, which has a Gaussian\ntransverse amplitude distribution, is focused by the second par-\nabolic mirror to feed at normal incidence, in a co-polar manner,\nthe open port of the waveguide under test. The optics are de-\nsigned to give a frequency-independent beam waist at the test\nport. The effective beam-waist size and location to optimally\nfeed the waveguide will change in frequency, but will be inde-\npendent of the location of the short in the waveguide. Thus, at\nany given frequency, the coupling coefficient between the beam\nand waveguide remains constant regardless of the position of the\nshort. Upon 180 reflection at the back short, the modified ter-\nahertz pulse exits the waveguide and is focused to a time-gated\nion-implanted silicon-on-sapphire photoconductive dipole an-\ntenna [7].\nA sequence of measurements was performed on a commer-\ncially available precision WR-8 waveguide adjustable short. The\ntime-domain interferograms corresponding to five different po-\nsitions of the backshort at 1-mm spacings are shown in Fig. 1(b).\nMaintaining the location of the waveguide relative to the\nbeam and using an adjustable short to provide different test\nwaveguide lengths ensured that a constant degree of coupling\nFig. 2.

The terahertz pulse\nproduced by the photoconductive antenna has frequency com-\nponents up to 3 THz.\nIII. WAVELET PRE-FILTERING\nA. Filter Bank Formulation of the Discrete Wavelet Transform\nPrior to the identification procedures, the time-domain signa-\ntures reflected by the short at the end of each waveguide length\nwere detrended by subtracting the mean. Such a detrending was\nperformed to avoid the need to include an offset term in the iden-\ntification model [8]. Wavelet filtering was performed because\nit is known to produce better results than conventional filters\nwhen the signal is nonstationary [9], [10]. The wavelet filtering\nprocess was performed using a filter bank formulation of the\nwavelet transform [11]. Each time-domain signature was repre-\nsented by a data vector of length , where the th element\nof , denoted by , represents the measured signal at the th\nsampling instant. The filter bank transform can be regarded as a\nchange in variables from to performed according to the\nfollowing operation:\n(1)\nwhere is a transformed variable and is a transform\nweight. It proves convenient to write the transform in matrix\nform as\n(2)\nwhere is the row vector of original vari-\nables, is the row vector of new (transformed) variables, and\nis the matrix of weights. Choosing to be unitary (i.e.,\n, the transform is said to be orthogonal and it, therefore, con-\nsists of a simple rotation in the coordinate axes (with the new\naxes directions determined by the columns of ). As described\nin the wavelet literature [12]\u2013[14], the discrete wavelet trans-\nform can be calculated in a fast manner by using a finite im-\npulse response (FIR) filter bank structure of the form depicted in\nFig. 2. It is worth noting that general -channel FIR filter bank\ndecompositions could also be employed in this context [15], but\nthe scope of this paper will be restricted to two-channel filter\nbanks, as in Fig. 2.\nIn this filter bank, the low-pass filtering result undergoes suc-\ncessive filtering iterations with the number of iterations chosen\nby the analyst. The final result of the decomposition of data\nvector is a vector resulting from the concatenation of row\nHADJILOUCAS et al.: COMPARISON OF SUBSPACE AND ARX MODELS OF WAVEGUIDE\u2019S TERAHERTZ TRANSIENT RESPONSE 2411\nTABLE I\nCONVOLUTION PROCEDURE FOR LOW-PASS FILTERING SHOWING\nRESULTS BEFORE AND AFTER DYADIC DOWNSAMPLING\nvectors and (termed approximation and detail co-\nefficients at the th scale level, respectively) in the following\nmanner:\n(3)\nwith coefficients in larger scales (e.g.,\n) associated with broad features in the data vector, and\ncoefficients in smaller scales (e.g., ) asso-\nciated with narrower features such as sharp peaks.\nLet and be the\nimpulse responses of the low-pass and high-pass filters, re-\nspectively. Assuming that filtering is carried out by circular\nconvolution, the procedure for generating the approximation\ncoefficients from the data vector is illustrated in Table I.\nThe convolution consists of flipping the filtering sequence and\nmoving it alongside the data vector. For each position of the\nfiltering sequence with respect to the data vector, the scalar\nproduct of the two is calculated (with missing points in the fil-\ntering sequence replaced with zeros). For instance, if , the\nthird row in Table I shows that .\nDyadic downsampling is then performed to to generate\ncoefficients . The detail coefficients are obtained in a\nsimilar manner by using the high-pass filtering sequence.\nIf the approximation and detail coefficients are stacked\nin vector , the wavelet transform can be expressed in\nthe matrix form (2) with the transformation matrix given by (4),\nshown at the bottom of this page.\nA requirement for the transform to be orthogonal (i.e.,\nis that the sum of the squares of each column must\nbe equal to one and the scalar product of different columns\nmust be equal to zero. Therefore, for a filter bank that utilizes\nlow-pass and high-pass filters, the following conditions ensure\northogonality of the transform so that no information is lost in\nthe decomposition process [11]\n(5a)\n(5b)\nIf the filtering sequences satisfy these conditions, the entire\nstructure is termed a quadrature-mirror filter (QMF) bank [12].\nA QMF bank is said to enjoy a perfect reconstruction (PR) prop-\nerty because can be reconstructed from , which means that\nthere is no loss of information in the decomposition process. In\nfact, from the relation , it follows that\nand , due to the orthogonality of the transform. At this\npoint, it should be noticed that other nonorthogonal transforms\ncan also enjoy a PR property, provided that they are associated\nto a nonsingular matrix . However, the analysis in this paper\nwill be restricted to orthogonal transforms.\nFiltering in the wavelet domain consists of replacing some of\nthe elements of by zero so that a new vector is produced and\nthen applying the inverse transform.\nB. Filtering Using Adaptively Chosen Wavelets\nOne limitation of the procedure described for the filtering of\nthe time-domain signatures in the wavelet domain is that the\nwavelets must be chosen a priori and are not adapted to opti-\nmally describe the experimental data set. Optimizing the trans-\nform to maximize its compression ability and, therefore, its effi-\nciency is normally achieved by optimizing the QMF bank. The\nQMF bank can be described by a set of parameters that can\nbe adjusted by any algorithm for unconstrained optimization to\nmaximize the compression ability of the transform.\nThe parametrization of PR FIR filter banks proposed by\nVaidyanathan as adapted by Sherlock and Monro [13] to pa-\nrametrize orthonormal wavelets of arbitrary compact support\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(4)\n2412 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. 52, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2004\nFig. 3. Procedure for parameterizing wavelet filter banks by N angles.\nmay be used for this purpose. For a filter bank of the form\nshown in Fig. 2 where the conditions in (5a) and (5b) are satis-\nfied, the transfer function of the low-pass filter in the -domain\ncan be written as\n(6)\nwhere superscript denotes that the filtering sequences have\nlength and , termed polyphasic compo-\nnents of , are given by\n(7a)\n(7b)\nDefining the polyphasic components and\nof the high-pass filter in a similar manner, a matrix\nmay be defined as follows:\n(8)\nIt can be shown [11], [12] that can be factorized as\n(9)\nwhere each pair of parameters are related to a common\nangular parameter as and\n. It follows that the filters can be completely\nparameterized by angles , which can assume\nany value in the set of real numbers, as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe weights of the low-pass filter can be easily recovered\nfrom a set of angles by using the following recursive for-\nmula [11], [12]:\n(10)\nfor with\n(11)\nEquation (10) with the initial condition of (11) provide a way\nto obtain the weights for a filter of length\nfrom the weights for a filter of length . To do that, one\nstarts by writing, from (8) and (10)\n(12a)\n(12b)\nwith and . A recursive formula\nfor the generation of low-pass filter weights with even indexes\ncan then be stated by using the definitions in (7a) and (7b)\nto expand (12a) as\n(13)\nfor , with and . From\nthe identity of terms with the same power of in the last line of\n(13), it follows that\n(14a)\nfor .\nA similar formula can be stated for the low-pass filter weights\nwith odd indexes by expanding (12b) as\n(14b)\nHADJILOUCAS et al.: COMPARISON OF SUBSPACE AND ARX MODELS OF WAVEGUIDE\u2019S TERAHERTZ TRANSIENT RESPONSE 2413\nfor . After obtaining the low-pass filtering\nsequence, as explained above, the high-pass filtering sequence\ncan be obtained by using (5b).\nCondition (5a) states that the weights of the low-\npass filter are subject to restrictions. Thus, there are de-\ngrees of freedom that can be used to optimize the filter bank\naccording to some performance criterion. It is worth noting that\nsince the restrictions are nonlinear and may define a nonconvex\nsearch space, the optimization task is not trivial. We circumvent\nthis difficulty by using the lattice structure for the filter bank,\nwhich is parameterized by angles that\ncan assume any real value, as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe problem then becomes one of unconstrained optimiza-\ntion in . The optimal filtering procedure employed in this\nstudy was aimed at maximizing the amount of energy in the\nwavelet coefficients kept in the thresholding process. The opti-\nmization consisted of maximizing an objective function\ndefined as\n(15)\nwhere is the vector of angles that parameterize the filter\nbank, as explained above, is the th wavelet coefficient\nresulting from the signal decomposition, and is the index\nset of the coefficients kept in the thresholding process. It is\nworth noting that is defined on the basis of the magnitude of\nthe wavelet coefficients before the optimization. The flexible\npolyhedron algorithm available in the MATLAB Optimization\nToolbox was employed to search for the optimum using the\nparameters associated with the wavelet as a starting point.\nThe optimization was carried out separately for each signal.\nIt is possible that the objective function (15) may have local\nmaxima different from the global maximum. In that case, the\nflexible polyhedron algorithm will tend to converge to the\nclosest local maximum. However, even if the global maximum\nis not attained, an improvement over the original wavelet\ntransform may still be obtained.\nFor comparative purposes, a nonoptimized filtering proce-\ndure, where each time-domain signal to be filtered was de-\ncomposed using a wavelet filter bank with two resolution\nlevels [16], was also performed. Hard thresholding was em-\nployed, with all wavelet coefficients with magnitude smaller\nthan a certain fraction of the largest coefficient being replaced\nwith zeros. The inverse transform was then applied to obtain the\nfiltered signal shown in Fig. 4.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4, a direct comparison between fil-\ntered and optimally filtered waveforms is almost impossible in\nthe time-domain plots. Plotting, however, pole-zero diagrams\nafter performing system identification for the terahertz-transient\nexcited waveguide sections makes the effect of filtering more\napparent.\nIV.

Ratioing the spectra\nand yields the effective complex insertion loss func-\ntion for a unit length waveguide [17] that is given from\n, where can be regarded as the fre-\nquency response of a linear system, which produces an output\nfor an input .\nInstead of using the ratioing procedure, which is very sensi-\ntive to measurement noise, system identification techniques can\nbe employed to obtain the complex insertion loss. Since this ap-\nproach is novel in the context of waveguide characterization,\nresults from two different identification techniques will be pre-\nsented to demonstrate this concept. Firstly, can be ob-\ntained directly through a parametric approach [8], [18] in which\nthe unit length waveguide is described by an AutoRegressive\nwith eXogenous input (ARX) model of the form\n(16)\nwhere is the response measured at time (sampling in-\nterval femtoseconds), are\nmodel coefficients, is the number of poles (equivalent to the\nsystem order), is the number of zeros, is a pure time\ndelay, and is a residual. can be discretized as a -do-\nmain transfer function\n(17)\nby making . The roots of (poles of )\nare associated with the modes of the waveguide (\nmodes in total). It is worth noting that, since the modes have an\noscillatory behavior, it is reasonable to model them with second-\norder terms [19], as in the right-hand side of (17).\n2414 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. 52, NO. 10, OCTOBER 2004\nThe roots of (zeros of ) are associated with the\nweights of each mode in the overall response of the system and\n(since the order of the denominator of is\nand there are terms in the expansion, each one with\na second-order denominator). Each partial fraction describes a\npropagating mode inside the waveguide. The th mode will have\na weight, resonant frequency of oscillation, and damping ratio\nassociated with the roots of the polynomial in the th denomi-\nnator. It is worth noting that this is the minimal representation\nneeded to describe a mode since the first-order term in the nu-\nmerator of the partial fraction will account for the cut-on effect\nin the frequency domain, whereas the second-order term in the\ndenominator will ensure that the response is attenuated at high\nfrequencies. For modeling parsimony, no extra zeros or poles\nare incorporated in the description of each mode. Parameters\nand can be obtained by minimizing the mean square value\nof the residual over the time horizon used for identification\nusing a least squares procedure.\nWhen choosing the model order , one must make an as-\nsumption on the number of modes that are propagating in the\nstructure. The value of can be accurately estimated after ob-\nserving the delay in the time-domain signatures recorded by the\nspectrometer from\n(18)\nwhere [17]. The choice of can be made in\nan empirical way from cross-correlation of the outputs with the\nresiduals. Other methods such as spectral analysis, analysis of\nthe information matrix, Akaike\u2019s final error prediction criterion,\nor Akaike\u2019s information theoretic criterion [8] are also appro-\npriate. The System Identification Toolbox of MATLAB chooses\non the basis of parsimony arguments in order to balance the\naccuracy and complexity (number of parameters to be identi-\nfied) of the model.\nIt is worth noting that the use of physical insight in the iden-\ntification procedure reduces the number of design choices that\nneed to be done on the basis of the data themselves. If the en-\ntire definition of the model structure (including the choice of\nand ) were data driven, the identification procedure would be\nmore sensitive to artifacts and noise.\nThe experimental time-domain reflection signatures from the\nbackshorts must be aligned with respect to each other before an\nidentification model is applied to the discretized time-domain\nsignatures. Using the known dimensions of the rectangular sec-\ntion of the waveguide, the cut-on frequency, guide wavelength,\nand theoretical phase delay at each frequency for each mode\nfor all modes propagating in the structure can be calcu-\nlated [20]. To calculate the overall phase delay, vectorial addi-\ntion must be performed for all the propagating modes inside the\nwaveguide. Since each mode is attenuated to a different degree,\nits contribution must be weighted by a weight and a factor\nwith an attenuation constant\n(19)\nBy matching the theoretical calculations for the phase delay\nin WR-8 waveguide samples to the recorded delay by the\ninterferometer, it was concluded that most of the power is\ndistributed among two modes and, thus, a fourth-order model\nshould be adopted for the backshort experiment. In addition,\nan examination of the phase velocity of the received signal\nshows that the propagation of terahertz pulses inside the\nwaveguide is almost dispersion free within the bandwidth of\nthe excitation pulse. Such preferential coupling of the pulse\nenergy to the lower order modes of the structure and the al-\nmost dispersion-free propagation observed are similar to the\nones obtained by Grischkowsky\u2019s group [21] where they also\nused broad-band excitation in their experimental procedure to\ncharacterize plastic ribbon terahertz waveguides.\nB. State-Space Modeling\nAn alternative way to obtain would be through a\nstate-space modeling approach. Discrete time state-space\nmodels represent difference equations, as ARX models do, but\nare rearranged such that only one delay is used in the expres-\nsion. This leads to the introduction of extra variables, known\nas state variables, which are not measured, but can, under\ncertain conditions, be reconstructed from input\u2013output data.\nFor the waveguide characterization problem, a single-input\nsingle-output state space model may be identified directly from\nthe data\n(20)\nwhere is an -dimensional state vector, is a deter-\nministic input, is the measured output, is the output\nresidual, is a scalar parameter, and and are ma-\ntrices of the appropriate dimensions. A sound method for es-\ntimating the state-space model parameters using input\u2013output\ndata is the subspace approach [22], [23]. A more detailed de-\nscription of the subspace algorithm as applied to optical sys-\ntems is provided elsewhere [24]. A common implementation is\nthe N4SID algorithm, which is available as part of MATLAB\u2019s\nSystem Identification Toolbox.\nThere is an equivalence between the state-space representa-\ntion, and the input\u2013output representation. Taking the -trans-\nform of the state-space model and eliminating the state vari-\nables, it follows that\n(21)\nWriting both ARX, as well as state-space models in an\ninput\/output form, a direct comparison of the two methods\nis possible. However, the state-space representation can be\ndeemed more appropriate than the ARX representation in op-\ntimal estimation and optimal control frameworks, as discussed\nin [24].\nInstead of relying on matching the observed phase delay in\nthe interferometer with theoretical models of phase delay that\ntake into account the waveguide dimensions to define the model\norder as the ARX model does, the subspace algorithm avoids\nHADJILOUCAS et al.: COMPARISON OF SUBSPACE AND ARX MODELS OF WAVEGUIDE\u2019S TERAHERTZ TRANSIENT RESPONSE 2415\nFig. 5.

The optimal model\norder is selected in such a way that the singular values for higher\norders are comparatively smaller.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe System Identification Toolbox of MATLAB v.6.1 was used\nto obtain models in the form of (17) and (21). Fig. 5 com-\npares the measured and simulated time domain responses for\nthe modeling data, which consisted of the signals for two- and\nthree-waveguide-length units. Both the ARX and state-space\nmodels reproduced 87% of the -variance.\nReaders familiarized with control systems theory will notice\nthat the time-domain plots of Fig. 5 resemble impulse responses\nof nonminimum phase systems [19]. However, one should bear\nin mind that those are the responses of the entire structure (in-\ncluding the coupling of the test piece), whereas the models con-\nsidered in this paper are developed for the waveguide only (the\ncoupling effects being ratioed out). Thus, if the nonminimum\nphase behavior is actually caused by coupling effects, it should\nnot be reflected in the identified models.\nFor validation, the models were applied to an independent\ndata set consisting of the responses for four- and five-wave-\nguide-length units. The results presented in Fig. 6 show that the\nmodel predictions are in good agreement with the measured re-\nsponses. It is worth noting that the accuracy is smaller in the\nvalidation set, as compared to the modeling set (Fig. 5). Such a\nfinding was to be expected because the validation data are not\nincluded in the model-building process. They are used instead\nto check the generalization ability of the model, i.e., its ability\nFig. 6.

Since the autocorrelation of the residuals\nis small, the assumption of whiteness in the noise can be as-\nsumed to be valid.\nFig. 9 shows the insertion loss of a unit length waveguide (as\ncalculated both by the ARX and state-space models) after ra-\ntioing the spectra obtained with the backshort adjusted to 3 mm\nwith that at 2 mm (denoted as the case), which is, in fact,\nthe frequency response of the identified models. An effective\npropagation constant for the multimode propagation can, there-\nfore, be calculated [17]. The observed increased insertion loss\nat higher frequencies is attributed to the variation of the conduc-\ntivity of gold with frequency.\nThe pole-zero charts in Figs. 10 and 11 provide details of the\nresulting ARX model and state-space model (when converted to\nan input\u2013output model). The dashed isoclines provide values of\nFig. 10. Pole-zero diagram for the state-space model showing the confidence\nregions using one standard deviation.\nFig. 11. Pole-zero diagram for the ARX model showing the confidence regions\nusing one standard deviation.\nnatural frequencies and damping ratios for the propagating\nmodes. The isoclines are obtained from\n(22)\nwhere by fixing and varying or by\nfixing and varying .\nIn these plots, the confidence locus of the zeros is much larger\nthan the confidence locus of the poles. This was to be expected\nsince it is easier to estimate poles than zeros, as they are asso-\nciated with the exponential decay and frequency of oscillation\nof the modes, whereas the zeros are associated with the weights\nof each mode, which are intuitively more difficult to obtain. In\naddition, if more modes were assumed in the model, the radii of\nthe confidence zones of the poles and zeros would increase since\nthe number of unknowns would be larger for the same number\nof observations, i.e., the confidence levels in the model decrease\nsignificantly when the model is over-parametrized.\nHADJILOUCAS et al.: COMPARISON OF SUBSPACE AND ARX MODELS OF WAVEGUIDE\u2019S TERAHERTZ TRANSIENT RESPONSE 2417\nFig. 12. (a) Zero- and (b) pole-charts of original (\u000f), wavelet-filtered ( ),\noptimal wavelet-filtered (}) responses assuming a fourth-order ARX model.\nSince the autocorrelation function of the residual for both the\nARX and state-space models is almost within the one standard\nerror bounds, it can be concluded that the models have been\nappropriately chosen. Some of the zeros calculated using the\nstate-space model are outside the unit circle, which indicates\nthat this model exhibits nonminimum phase behavior, which is\nnot the case with the identified ARX model.\nFig. 12 provides pole and zero charts where an ARX identifi-\ncation model is used to obtain after assuming two modes\npropagating in the structure. It was observed that the wavelet fil-\ntering process resulted in a zero that was outside the unit circle\nbeing brought to the inside. This is in accordance with our ex-\npectations since there does not seem to be a physical reason for\na zero being outside the unit circle.\nAs stated earlier, the poles are directly related to the mode\nproperties. Filtering increased the estimated damping in the\nhigher frequency mode. The frequency itself remained practi-\ncally unchanged. Furthermore, in the lower frequency mode,\nthe filtering decreased the estimated frequency, whereas the\ndamping remained unchanged.\nA premise of this study is that the filtering procedure im-\nproves the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements and, conse-\nquently, the accuracy of the identification results. However, one\nshould bear in mind that if the filtering is too aggressive (in the\nsense of more wavelet coefficients being replaced with zeros),\nthere is a risk that the identified model will be related to the filter\ndynamics rather than to the waveguide response. At this point,\nit is worth noting that the proposed wavelet optimization proce-\ndure may actually alleviate such a risk. In fact, by tailoring the\nwavelet transform to the denoising task, it is possible to mini-\nmize the distortion effects on the signal caused by removing the\nnoise.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nBoth ARX and state-space models are efficient modeling\ntools for linear processes such as energy dissipation in a wave-\nguide test piece. These tools, however, require low-noise data\nsets, which might not be realizable within practical integration\ntime scales. Wavelet pre-filtering is well suited to the denoising\nof the nonstationary data sets obtained in terahertz transient\nspectrometry.\nOne limitation of commonly used wavelets such as the\nfamily is that the wavelets must be chosen a priori and are not\nadapted to optimally describe the experimental data set. We,\ntherefore, introduced a QMF bank to optimize the compression\nability of the transform before performing any thresholding in\nthe wavelet domain. The optimal filtering procedure employed\nin this study was aimed at maximizing the amount of energy in\nthe wavelet coefficients kept in the thresholding process.\nAlthough pre-filtering of the time-domain signatures with a\nand an optimal filter did not produce traces that would be\nclassified as different by eye inspection, these different filtering\nprocedures had a marked effect on the pole-zero diagrams ob-\ntained after ARX and subspace models were fitted to the data.\nThis justifies their use in waveguide mode identification from\nbroad-band experiments.\nAn extension of the subspace algorithm to bilinear systems\nwould be required to take into account the nonlinearities of the\ncut-on conditions in the modes and account for evanescent fields\nfor a more accurate model. In this case, the complex values\narising in the simulations would be treated separately in matrix\nform in a similar manner to real valued data. The good fit, how-\never, of both models to the time-domain data sets indicated that\nthis was not necessary in our current analysis. In fact, since the\nscope of this study was restricted to the modeling of the prop-\nagating modes, the cut-on conditions and the evanescent fields\nwere not modeled or considered in the validation of the obtained\nmodels. Different experimental protocols may be designed to\nfocus the study on such a phenomena. In that case, the nonlinear\neffects would have to be properly taken into account.\nFinally, it is worth noting that, although the proposed analysis\nin the wavelet domain has been placed within a filtering frame-\nwork, there have been suggestions [25] that such transforms\nmay also be used directly for waveguide mode identification.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

Since 2001, he is Head\nof research (it Oberingenieur) at RWTH Aachen, where he is involved with\nactivities in the fields of opto-electronics, ultrafast science, ultrahigh-frequency\ndevices, optical data storage, and nanotechnology. He has authored or coau-\nthored five book contributions and over 130 publications and international\nconference presentations. He holds three patents.\nDr. Bol\u00edvar was the recipient of a Heinrich Hertz Fellowship from the Science\nand Research Ministry of the State of Northrhine\u2013Westfalia for his doctoral re-\nsearch. He was also the recipient of the Wilhelm Borchers Medallion of RWTH\nAachen.\nHeinrich Kurz was born in Austria, in 1943. He\nreceived the Ph.D. degree from the University of\nVienna, Vienna, Austria, in 1971.\nFrom 1971 to 1980, he was Scientific Staff\nMember with Philips Research Laboratories, Ham-\nburg, Germany, where he was engaged in research\non optical storage and data processing. From 1981 to\n1984, he was with a Research Associate with Harvard\nUniversity, during which time his scientific interest\nwas directed toward the interaction of ultrashort laser\npulses with semiconductors. Since 1985, he has been\na Professor of electric engineering with the Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische\nHochschule (RWTH), Aachen, Germany. His research includes nonlinear\noptics, femtosecond laser interactions, and spectroscopy and application of ul-\ntrashort laser pulses in electrical engineering and material science. Since 1990,\nhe has been the Head of the Institut f\u00fcr Halbleitertechnik, RWTH Aachen,\ntaking the Chair of Semiconductor Electronics. His main research activities\nhave been extended to nanoelectronics, mainly silicon-based nanoelectronics\nand nanotechnology in general for information science. In 1993, he founded\nthe AMO GmbH, a nonprofit organization, to promote science and technology\nfrom university research into strategic industrial areas. Since 1997, he is the\nScientific Director of the Advanced Microelectronic Center Aachen (AMICA)\nbuilt by the AMO GmbH. Since 1998, he coordinates the national efforts in\nGermany on nanoelectronics and functional lateral nanostructures in general.\nJ. Martyn Chamberlain has been involved with\nissues related to the applicable physics of the\nterahertz-frequency regime for over 30 years. His\ngraduate work at Oxford University centered on\nterahertz-frequency investigations of the electrical\nproperties of ultra-pure III\u2013V semiconductors using\ntechniques which, at the time, were extremely novel.\nHe subsequently joined Nottingham University,\nNottingham, U.K., as a Lecturer in physics. Into\nthe 1980s, he assumed control of the semiconductor\ncharacterization facility at Nottingham University,\nwhich was part of a very substantial investment in semiconductor physics that\nwas initiated at that time in the U.K. In 1989, he was appointed Reader in\nexperimental physics at Nottingham University. During that time, his interests\nwere in the development of small solid-state devices as potential sources of\nterahertz radiation. These included resonant tunnel diodes, superlattice oscilla-\ntors, self-oscillating mixers, and other devices. In addition, he also pioneered\nmicromachining techniques to realize passive terahertz frequency circuits that\ncontained such active devices. In 1999, he joined The University of Leeds, as\nProfessor of engineering physics and Director of the Institute for Microwaves\nand Photonics. He continued research on solid-state sources for terahertz use\nand on systems for the optical generation of pulses of terahertz radiation. This\nled to a large European Project (Teravision), which he coordinated, and for\nwhich he was dedicated to the realization of practical terahertz systems for\npotential use in medical diagnostics. Since September 2003, he has held a\ndual appointment as Master (i.e., President) of Grey College, University of\nDurham, Durham, U.K., and Professor of applied physics with the University of\nDurham. In September 2004, he will become Coordinator of the multimillion\nEuropean Union program TeraNova, which brings together academic and\nindustrial groups in Europe working on new terahertz sources and systems\nfor use in healthcare, biotechnology, security, and process control. He has\nauthored or coauthored approximately 200 refereed papers and has presented\nnumerous invited talks and summer schools. He acts as consultant to a number\nof companies, and sits on several U.K. government panels.\nDr. Chamberlain has organized numerous conferences, including the First\nInternational Conference on Biomedical Imaging and Sensing Applications of\nTerahertz Technology, held in the U.K. in 2001.\n"}
