The Kodar mountains in eastern Siberia accommodate 30 small, cold-based glaciers with a\ncombined surface area previously estimated at \u000219 km2. Very little is known about these glaciers, which\nwere first surveyed in the late 1950s. In this paper, we use terrestrial photogrammetry to calculate\nchanges in the surface area, elevation, volume and geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier between\n1979 and 2007 and relate these to meteorological data from nearby Chara weather station (1938\u20132007).\nThe glacier surface area declined by 20\u0003 6.9% and the surface lowered by an average of 20\u00031.8m\n(mean thinning 0.71ma\u20131), resulting in a strongly negative cumulative and average mass balance of\n\u201318\u0003 1.6mw.e. and \u2013640\u000360mmw.e. a\u20131, respectively.

In comparison to the 1961\u201390 period, regional climate projections for the A2 and B2 CO2\nemission scenarios developed using the PRECIS regional climate model indicate that summer\ntemperatures will increase by 2.6\u20134.78C and 4.9\u20136.28C, respectively, during the 2071\u20132100 period.\nThe annual total of solid precipitation will increase by 20% under the B2 scenario but is projected to\ndecline by 3% under the A2 scenario. Azarova glacier exhibits high sensitivity to climatic warming due to\nits low elevation and exposure to comparatively high summer temperatures. Further summer warming\nand a decline in solid precipitation projected under the A2 scenario will force Azarova glacier to retreat\nfurther, but the impact of an increase in solid precipitation projected under the B2 scenario is more\nuncertain and requires further investigation before a more conclusive prediction can be made.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe progressive shrinkage of temperate and polythermal\nglaciers located in the maritime regions in response to the\nclimatic warming of the 20th century has been widely\nreported (e.g. Barry, 2006). Less is known about cold-based\nglaciers located in continental interiors. These regions are\ncharacterized by extremely low air temperatures and precipi-\ntation in the cold, \u2018climatically dormant\u2019 season, and by the\nfact that accumulation and ablation can occur simultan-\neously in summer. These glaciers form mostly through\nrefreezing of meltwater that prevents mass loss in the\naccumulation zone (Preobrazhensky, 1960). To date, most\nresearch on the mass balance and shrinkage of cold-based\nglaciers has focused on the high-elevation glaciers of the\nTibetan Plateau, many of which are influenced by the\nmonsoon. These studies show that the Tibetan glaciers\ncharacterized by summer accumulation are likely to be more\nsensitive to climatic warming than glaciers dominated by a\nwinter accumulation regime (Fujita and Ageta, 2000; Fujita,\n2008). However, very little is known about the response of\nthe cold-based Siberian glaciers located at lower elevations.\nIn Siberia, glacial research has focused mainly on the\nAltai mountains, where a significant decline in mass\nbalance and surface area of glaciers has been reported\nbetween the 1950s and 2000s, but these glaciers grow\nmostly through accumulation in April\u2013May and September\u2013\nOctober (Kadota and Gombo, 2007; Shahgedanova and\nothers, 2010). In the Suntar-Khayata, northeastern Siberia,\nAnanicheva (2006) reported glacier shrinkage of 19%\nbetween 1973 and 2003, with a negative average annual\nspecific mass balance of 206mmw.e. measured for glacier\nNo. 31 (1957\u20132001) using geodetic methods. In contrast,\nGurney and others (2008) suggested a more subdued retreat\nof glaciers in the Buordakh massif, Chersky mountains,\nnortheastern Siberia. These glaciers lost 17% of their surface\narea between 1850 and 2000, comparable to values\nreported by Solomina (2000) for Chersky, Kodar and\nSuntar-Khayata. No other mass-balance measurements\nare available in Siberia (outside the Altai). The paucity of\nassessments of glacier change and the regional variability\nof rates that have been measured necessitate further\nresearch into the behaviour of cold-based Siberian glaciers\nthat gain their mass through meltwater refreezing.\nOne area that has evaded detailed scrutiny is the Kodar\nmountains. The Kodar glaciers were first mentioned in\ntravellers\u2019 reports in 1883 but were not examined in any\ndetail until 1958 when Preobrazhensky (1960) catalogued 30\nglaciers with a combined area of 15 km2. Later analysis of\naerial photographs from 1963 confirmed the existence of 30\nglaciers with a combined surface area of 18.8 km2 (Novikova\nand Grinberg, 1972; World Glacier Inventory (WGI), http:\/\/\nnsidc.org\/data\/glacier_inventory\/). The remote location con-\nstrained further glaciological research in the Kodar, although\na 1 : 10 000 map of Azarova glacier was produced in 1979\nAnnals of Glaciology 52(58) 2011 129\nfrom a theodolite survey by V.M. Plyusnin (unpublished;\nIrkutsk Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences).\nThis paper presents results of more recent geodetic\nmeasurements of Azarova glacier (in 2007) and links these\nto both local and regional climate data. The objectives are:\n(1) to assess changes in the surface area and elevation of\nAzarova since 1979 using terrestrial photogrammetry; (2) to\nestimate the geodetic mass balance of Azarova for the 1979\u2013\n2008 period; (3) to relate the observed glacier changes to\nclimatic variation; and (4) to present future regional climate-\nchange scenarios and discuss their possible implications for\nthe Kodar glaciers.\nSTUDY AREA\nThe Kodar mountains are located at 568450\u2013578150N,\n117\u20131188 E (Fig. 1). The elevations range between 1500\nand 2900ma.s.l., and the highest elevation is 3072m.\nGlaciers are positioned mainly between 2000 and 2700m\na.s.l. The WGI (http:\/\/nsidc.org\/data\/glacier_inventory\/)\nclassifies 16 glaciers as cirque, 6 as mountain-valley, 3 as\ncirque-valley and 5 as niche glaciers. Sixty per cent of the\nglaciers face north and northeast. Azarova glacier is the\nsecond largest in the Kodar and is the focus of this study. It is a\nnorth-facing mountain-valley glacier located at 56.8898N,\n117.5778 E and extending from 2480m down to 2145ma.s.l.\n(Fig. 2). In 2007, its area was 0.56 km2 with a length of 1.7 km\n(there are no tributaries). Avalanche nourishment from the\nsteep valley sides predetermines an asymmetric structure of\nthe glacier, with its surface sloping down the valley fromwest\nto east. Located in front of the glacier is an area of \u2018dead ice\u2019\ncovered by moraine deposits. The area is characterized by\ncontinuous permafrost with \u000260% ice content (Preo-\nbrazhensky, 1960).\nThe regional climate is characterized by extreme con-\ntinentality (Shahgedanova, 2002). The continentality index,\ndefined as the range between the average temperatures of\nthe warmest and coldest months of the year, is 50. The\nregion is dominated by the Siberian high between Novem-\nber and March. At the Chara meteorological station, located\n50 km to the southeast (56.928N, 118.378 E; 711ma.s.l.;\nFig. 1), the mean monthly air temperatures from November\nto March range from \u2013188C to \u2013338C; and the seasonal\nprecipitation total for this cold period accounts for only 5%\nof the annual total of 356mm (Fig. 3). The Siberian high\ndevelops in the lowest 2000\u20132500m and is replaced by a\ntrough of low pressure aloft, which results in a decoupling\nbetween the processes occurring in the lower and the\nmiddle atmospheres. In winter, both air temperature and\nprecipitation increase with altitude (Panagiotopoulos and\nothers, 2005).\nRegular meteorological measurements have never been\nconducted in the Kodar, but those from individual years\nindicate that snowfalls occur throughout the year, and about\n80% of solid precipitation occurs in late spring and early\nFig. 1. Location map. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery of the Kodar mountains containing 30 small mountain-valley and\ncirque glaciers is used as background.\nFig. 2. Photograph of Azarova glacier taken during the photo-\ntheodolite survey in August 2007.\nShahgedanova and others: Geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier130\nautumn (Novikova and Grinberg, 1972). Glaciers accumu-\nlate mass predominantly through water refreezing (Preo-\nbrazhensky, 1960). The ablation season, during which the\nformation of ice also occurs, is limited to July\u2013August\n(Novikova and Grinberg, 1972). Although the melt season is\nshort, summer temperatures are comparatively high, and at\nthe Chara station the mean July air temperature is 168C.\nDATA AND METHODS\nCalculation of surface area, elevation and geodetic\nmass balance\nWidely used until the 1950s, ground-based photogrammetry\nsurveys have gradually been superseded by aerial photog-\nraphy and, more recently, by both satellite and airborne\nremote sensing (e.g. Andreassen, 1999; Arendt and others,\n2002; Bauder and others, 2007; Thibert and others, 2008).\nHowever, ground-based photogrammetry remains an accur-\nate tool and can provide a very useful comparison with\nhistorical surveys to estimate glacier change. Neither aerial\nphotographs from 1963 nor more recent aerial imagery\nsuitable for assessing glacier volume change are available\nfor the Kodar mountains. However, the data from the August\n1979 survey were made available and this survey was\nrepeated in August 2007 using the same control points (CPs)\nand baselines as in 1979. This enabled an estimation of\nchanges in the area and surface elevation of Azarova glacier\nand its geodetic mass balance for the 1979\u20132007 period.\nIndeed, the geodetic method of mass-balance measurement\nis considered to be more accurate over longer time periods\nthan the short-term glaciological method using stake\nmeasurements (Cox and March, 2004; Cogley, 2009). Use\nof the direct glaciological method is also complicated on\nglaciers that gain mass through refreezing of meltwater\n(Fujita and Ageta, 2000). The two consecutive surveys\ntherefore provided a unique opportunity to assess glacier\nvolume change and mass balance on one of the Kodar\nglaciers, and represent the only available mass-balance\nrecord for this region.\nChanges in the surface area and elevation of Azarova\nglacier were estimated as follows: (1) a photo-theodolite\nsurvey of the glacier was conducted in July\u2013August 2007;\n(2) a map and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the glacier\nwere developed using the results of the 2007 survey; (3) a\nDEM was derived from the 1979 map; (4), changes in\nsurface area and surface elevation and volume were inferred\nfrom a comparison of the 1979 and 2007 maps and DEMs\nrespectively; and (5) geodetic mass balance, G, was calcu-\nlated using Equation (1), from Cogley (2009):\nG \u00bc \u0002\u0002h\n\u0002t\n, \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u0002 is ice density (kgm\u20133), \u0002h is the change in glacier\nsurface elevation averaged over the glacier surface, and \u0002t is\nthe 1979\u20132007 time span. The variable \u0002h was averaged\nover the mean of 1979 and 2007 glacier surface areas\nfollowing Thibert and others (2008). Volume changes were\ncalculated for the common glaciated areas covered by the\n1979 and 2007 DEMs and include ice that had disappeared\naltogether (Bauder and others, 2007).\nThe photo-theodolite survey used two pairs of ground-\nbased photographic images of Azarova glacier from the\nsame two baselines that were used in 1979 (Fig. 2). Two\nbaselines were considered sufficient because of the very\nsimple shape of the glacier and the good visibility of its\nentire surface (Fig. 2). A local geodetic network of 55 CPs\nwas established using topographic features on the stable\nterrain around the glacier. Seventeen of the CPs were used in\nboth 1979 and 2007 and were used as tie points for a\nrelative control and co-registration of the 1979 and 2007\nmaps and DEMs. The CPs located on stable terrain were\nused to calculate root-mean-square errors (RMSE). RMSEx,y\nof their positions for 1979 and 2007 was \u00032.4m.\nA 1 : 10 000 scale map of Azarova glacier with 10m\nequidistant contours was produced from the 2007 survey\nusing a stereo-autograph. The 1 : 10 000 map from 1979 with\n10m equidistant contours was digitized manually with an\naverage horizontal deviation of \u00030.3mm on the map, which\nis \u00033m on the ground. Changes in the surface area of\nAzarova were estimated by the superimposition and\nsubtraction of the two maps. Digitized contours of the\nsurrounding area were superimposed where possible.\nTwo DEMs for 1979 and 2007 were developed from the\nmaps using ArcView 3.2 software. Elevations were inter-\npolated on regular grids with a resolution of 5m using the\nkrigingmethod. The 5m grid spacing was found to be optimal\nfor co-registration of DEMs, in line with the recommenda-\ntions by Cox and March (2004) for calculating geodetic mass\nbalance. Changes in elevation of the glacier surface were\nderived by subtracting the 2007 elevation data from the 1979\ndata for individual cells of the regular grids and averaging for\ndifferent elevation zones and for the entire glacier.\nIt was assumed that changes in elevation were due to loss\nof ice with a constant density of 900 kgm\u20133, which is used\nin the majority of geodetic mass-balance calculations\n(Andreassen, 1999; Arendt and others, 2002; Cogley,\n2009). Zemp and others (2010) commented that this\nassumption often leads to overestimation of mass balance\ndue to changes in snow and firn layers. However, we\nconsider this assumption realistic for Kodar glaciers where\nice formation through refreezing is dominant and, as a\nresult, firn content is minimal (Preobrazhensky, 1960).\nQuantification of error\nThe accuracy of the estimation of surface area and elevation\nchanges depends on (1) errors in triangulation and map and\nDEM construction; (2) comparison of two maps and DEMs;\n(3) delineation of glacier boundaries; and (4) seasonality in\nglacier thickness change (Sapiano and others, 1998;\nAndreassen, 1999; Arendt and others, 2002; Thibert and\nothers, 2008).\nFig. 3. Monthly climatologies of air temperature (1938\u20132007;\ncurve) and precipitation (1952\u20132007; columns) for the Chara\nmeteorological station.\nShahgedanova and others: Geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier 131\nThe planimetric error resulted from (1) errors in\ntriangulation and co-registration of the 1979 and 2007\nmaps, and (2) errors in glacier boundary delineation due to\nthe presence of snow and, more importantly, debris cover.\nTerm (1) was calculated as the root sum square of RMSEx,y\n(\u00032.4m) of the 1979 and 2007 tie-point locations and\nerrors resulting from digitization of contours on both maps\n(\u00033m on the ground), giving a total of \u00034.8m. To express\nthis error term as a percentage of glacier area, a buffer\n4.8m wide was created along the 1979 and 2007 glacier\noutlines (Granshaw and Fountain, 2006). The error term\nwas calculated as an average ratio between the original\n1979 and 2007 area and the areas with an increment of\n4.8m, yielding an error of 5.7%. Both the 1979 and 2007\nsurveys were conducted in August, in the second half of the\nablation season. In 2007, the glacier tongue was free of\nseasonal snow which remained along the shaded glacier\nmargins at higher elevations only. The uncertainty due to\nthe presence of snow was resolved by mapping glacier\nboundaries from the Earth Resources Observation Systems\nEROS-B satellite image with a resolution of 0.70m,\nobtained on 7 September 2007 in the final days of the\nablation period (which in 2007 extended into September)\nunder cloud-free conditions. The difference between the\nsatellite-derived (0.55 km2) and ground-based (0.56 km2)\nsurface areas of the glacier was 2%, which was taken as an\nerror due to the presence of snow along the glacier margins\nin both 2007 and 1979. This is likely to be an over-\nestimation reflecting errors in mapping from a satellite\nimage as well as the presence of snow, especially for 2007.\nThe summer of 1979 was one of the coldest on record (see\nFig. 7a further below), and although the extent of snow\ncover was low in mid-August when the survey was\nconducted (personal communication from V.M. Plyusnin,\n2009), a 2% error is likely to be realistic.\nThe presence of debris cover on the glacier tongue is the\nmost significant source of uncertainty, as debris cover masks\ntransition between the glacier and the body of dead ice\nlocated in front of the glacier. A marginal hollow around the\nglacier snout, which is shallow on Azarova due to the very\nlow ice flow velocities (Novikova and Grinberg, 1972), was\nused as an indicator of the glacier boundary. The same\nindicator was used in 1979 (personal communication from\nV.M. Plyusnin, 2009). The adoption of the same approach to\nthe definition of glacier boundaries in 1979 and 2007\nhelped to minimize this uncertainty. However, potential\nerrors in the 1979 delineation cannot be evaluated\nnumerically from the available data. To account for them,\nan additional error of 2%, based on our experience of\nrepeated in situ mapping of debris-covered glacier tongues\nby different surveyors, was added to the 1979 area\ncalculation. The total planimetric error was calculated as\nthe root sum square of all the above terms and is 6.9%.\nVertical precision of the 1979 map was estimated as\n\u00035m, which is the half-distance between the contours\n(Seymour, 1980). However, it is not the absolute elevations\nbut consistency between the 1979 and 2007 DEMs that is\nimportant in calculating changes in glacier surface eleva-\ntion (Cox and March, 2004; Thibert and others, 2008). A\ncomparison of the elevations of the 1979 and 2007 DEM\ngridcells representing ice-free stable terrain produced\nRMSEz of \u00031.8m. This value was taken as an error in the\ncalculation of elevation change. The error in seasonality of\nthickness change related to the seasonal snow cover and\nfirn on the glacier surface was negligible given the small\nextent of seasonal snow cover in August and the low\namount of firn.\nSapiano and others (1998) and Elsberg and others (2001)\nestimated the uncertainty in geodetic mass-balance calcula-\ntion due to the use of glacier-wide average density to be 5\u2013\n6% for glaciers with snow, firn and ice in vertical profiles. A\nsensitivity test based on snow and firn covering 20% of the\nglacier surface and with an average firn layer depth of 3m\n(both assumed values exceed the 2007 observations)\nshowed that neglecting snow and firn densities on Azarova\nresulted in a 1% error in the calculation of the glacier-wide\naverage density.\nClimate data\nThe time series of air temperature and precipitation from the\nChara meteorological station (Fig. 3) were used to evaluate\nthe observed variations in regional climate. The air-tempera-\nture and precipitation time series started in 1938 and 1951,\nrespectively. In addition to these data, a Campbell Scientific\nautomatic weather station (AWS) was deployed on Azarova\nat 2280ma.s.l. (Fig. 3) from 25 July to 13 August 2007,\nproviding data on air temperature, incoming and outgoing\nshort- and longwave radiation fluxes measured by GNR4\nKipp & Zonen radiometer, and wind speed and wind\ndirection every 15min. Due to a deficiency in the electric\ncircuit of the AWS, the sonic ranger data were intermittent.\nHowever, ablation was measured daily by the stake method\nusing a network of seven stakes installed along the vertical\nprofile of the glacier.\nIn addition to meteorological observations, regional\nclimate-change scenarios were generated using the Provid-\ning REgional Climates for Impact Studies (PRECIS) regional\nclimate modelling (RCM) system based on the HadRM3P\nRCM. PRECIS is a hydrostatic model with a horizontal\nresolution of 25 km. Its full details are given by Jones and\nothers (2004). PRECIS (HadRM3P) has been successfully\nused in mountainous regions, demonstrating particularly\nrobust performance in the Altai (Shahgedanova and others,\n2010). Three integrations have been performed for two time\nslices: 1961\u201390 represents the \u2018baseline\u2019 climate and 2071\u2013\n2100 is used for future climate-change projections for the A2\nand B2 CO2 emission scenarios. These two scenarios\nassume increases in mean CO2 concentrations to 830 and\n600ppm by 2100, respectively (Nakia\u00b4enovia\u00b4 and Swart,\n2000). The model domain extent was 40.5\u201361.58N, 67.5\u2013\n130.58 E. Model output for the area 56.5\u201357.58N, 117\u2013\n118.58 E was used in the analysis performed here.\nPrior to the interpretation of regional climate-change\nscenarios, model output was validated against the data\nderived from CRU TS3 gridded datasets of observed air\ntemperatures and precipitation intensities with a resolution\nof 0.58 (Mitchell and Jones, 2005). In addition, validation\nwas performed using data for the 1961\u201390 period from three\nmeteorological stations (Chara; Bolshaya Leprinda (56.68N,\n117.68 E; 1001ma.s.l.); and Nichatka (57.48N, 117.38 E;\n561ma.s.l.)) located in the selected domain. The gridded\ndatasets incorporate data from the stations that were\nfunctioning intermittently in the region in the 1961\u201390\nperiod (Mitchell and Jones, 2005). However, gridded\ntemperature and precipitation data were not adjusted for\naltitude and, in this sense, the gridded datasets have little\nadvantage over data from the individual stations, all of\nwhich are located in valleys. The average altitude of the\nShahgedanova and others: Geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier132\nmodel validation domain was 1425ma.s.l. The average\naltitude of the three stations was 758ma.s.l.\nThe annual cycles of both air temperature and precipi-\ntation intensity are reproduced by the model (Fig. 4), and the\ndifferences in absolute values are mostly accounted for by\nthe difference in altitude between the model domain\nelevation and station elevations. The monthly temperatures\nderived from the gridded datasets are in close agreement\nwith the modelled data in summer, only exceeding the\nmodel by 0.6\u20131.78C between April and September (Fig. 4a).\nThe differences between the modelled and the station data\nare larger, at 4.7\u20135.78C, but this is largely due to the 667m\ndifference in altitude between the meteorological stations\nand the model domain, which accounts for 48C under the\naverage environmental lapse rate of 0.68C (100m)\u20131. Be-\ntween November and February, modelled temperatures\nexceed station temperatures by 2.2\u20134.78C (Fig. 4a), in line\nwith the persistent temperature inversions characteristic of\nthe region (Shahgedanova, 2002). Validation of precipitation\nintensities in eastern Siberia is extremely difficult due to the\nabsence of high-altitude stations and a considerable differ-\nence between the precipitation amounts received in valleys\nand at high elevations, especially in winter (Shahgedanova,\n2002). The modelled precipitation intensities significantly\nexceed the observed intensities (Fig. 4b), but this difference\nis consistent with altitudinal precipitation gradients and with\nthe short-term precipitation measurements conducted at\nhigh elevations in the 1950s\u201360s. In the Kodar and adjacent\nmountain ranges, Preobrazhensky (1960) and Novikova and\nGrinberg (1972) report annual precipitation totals of 600\u2013\n960 and 840\u20131200mm in the 1000\u20131700 and 2000\u20132500m\nelevation bands, respectively. The average annual precipi-\ntation total simulated by PRECIS is 1146mm. Our precipi-\ntation measurements conducted in July\u2013August 2008\nindicated that monthly precipitation totals measured near\nAzarova glacier (at 2055ma.s.l.) exceeded monthly precipi-\ntation totals at the Chara station by a factor of 2.7. This is\nconsistent with an overestimation of station precipitation by\nPRECIS by a factor of 2.6.\nRESULTS\nThe surface area of Azarova glacier decreased by 20%\nbetween 1979 and 2007 (Table 1) and, as expected, the\nretreat was observed predominantly at low elevations below\n2200ma.s.l. (Fig. 5). On average, the glacier thinned by\n20\u00031.4m between 1979 and 2007 or by 0.71ma\u20131.\nImportantly, lowering of the glacier surface has occurred\nnot only on the glacier tongue but across the entire glacier\n(Figs 5 and 6). In the lowest 200m, surface lowering reached\n40m, but even at the highest elevations over 2400m, the\nglacier surface lowered by 10\u201320m. The reduction in glacier\nFig. 4.

The cumulative area-\nweighted mass balance for the 1979\u20132007 period was\n\u201318\u00031.6mw.e., and the average mass balance was\n\u2013640\u000360mmw.e. a\u20131.\nAnalysis of the climate records shows that while there is\nno statistically significant linear trend in the July\u2013August (JA)\ntemperature at the Chara station between 1938 and 2007, a\nstep change in JA temperature occurred after 1980 (Fig. 7a).\nFrom 1938 to 1979, the average JA temperature was 14.38C;\nfrom 1980 to 2007, it was 15.38C. The difference between\nthe means is statistically significant at the 0.05 confidence\nlevel. JA air temperature has been increasing since 1979 at a\nrate of 0.0368Ca\u20131 (Fig. 7a). Importantly, June temperature\nhas been increasing since the early 1960s at a rate of\n0.058Ca\u20131, suggesting a potential extension of the ablation\nseason. There are no statistically significant long-term linear\ntrends in either annual (Fig. 7b), September\u2013May (not\nshown) or JA (Fig. 7c) precipitation, although there was a\n9% increase in JA precipitation from the 1952\u201379 to the\n1980\u20132007 period, which is consistent with increasing air\ntemperatures.\nNot only the amount but also the occurrence and type of\nsummer precipitation is an important control over glacier\nmelt. An increase in air temperature limits the occurrence of\nsnowfalls and enhances glacier sensitivity to warming due to\nthe changing albedo of the glacier surface and, on cold\nglaciers, to additional heat flux supplied by rainfall (Fujita,\n2008). During 2007 and 2008, albedo on Azarova glacier\nincreased from an average of 26% to >40% for 2\u20133days\nfollowing snowfalls. Moreover, even when JA temperatures\nwere close to the long-term average, three and five snowfalls\nwere registered in 2007 and 2008 respectively, resulting in\nnear-zero ablation for a total of 10\u201315 days of the 2month\nablation season.\nResults of climate modelling show that in 2071\u20132100 the\nmean July and August temperatures are projected to increase\nby 3.28C and 4.78C under the B2 scenario, and by 4.98C and\n6.28C under the more aggressive A2 scenario (Fig. 8a). Even\nunder the moderate B2 scenario, the ablation season is\nprojected to increase by 5\u20136weeks. Annual precipitation\ntotals will increase by 29% and 31% under the B2 and A2\nscenarios, respectively (Fig. 8b). However, the total amounts\nof solid precipitation are projected to be quite different,\nincreasing by 20% under the B2 scenario but declining by\n3% under the A2 scenario. The proportion of summer\nsnowfalls (June\u2013August), however, will decline from the\ncurrent 2\u201315% to 0\u20132% under the moderate B2 scenario\n(Fig. 8c). Liquid precipitation accounts for 17% and 26% of\nthe total in May and September of the baseline period and\nwill account for 22% and 40% under the B2 scenario\n(Fig. 8c). This statistic applies to an average altitude of the\nmodel domain that is 720m below the current glacier\ntongue elevation. However, the projected shift from snowfall\nFig. 6.

Modelling studies suggest mass-balance sensi-\ntivity of \u0002350mmw.e. a\u20131 per 18C warming for glaciers with\na melt season of 60 days (Braithwaite and others, 2002), and\n200mmw.e. a\u20131 for glaciers with the continentality index of\n50 (de Woul and Hock, 2005), which are characteristic of\nAzarova. Estimation of mass-balance sensitivity for a 18C\ntemperature increase and 10% precipitation increase pro-\nposed by Oerlemans (1993) yields a sensitivity of\n\u2013390mmw.e. for the annual precipitation, exceeding that\nobserved at the Chara station in 1979\u20132007 by a factor of\n2.6, and is consistent with the PRECIS simulation of\nprecipitation intensities at higher altitudes during the base-\nline period. The assessments by Braithwaite and others\n(2002) and de Woul and Hock (2005), however, refer to\nsubpolar glaciers and those located north of 608N, and these\ngenerally experience lower summer temperatures. In July\u2013\nAugust 2008, incoming solar radiation on Azarova averaged\n243Wm\u20132, daytime net radiation was 178Wm\u20132 and daily\nmean air temperature was 6.48C, which is comparable with\nmeteorological conditions on temperate glaciers (e.g. in the\nEuropean Alps (Oerlemans and others, 2009) and in the\nCaucasus (Shahgedanova and others, 2007)). Daily ablation\nrates were 20\u201350mmw.e. d\u20131 for snow and 20\u201390mmw.e.\nd\u20131 for ice. This occurred under temperatures close to the\nlong-term average and indicates glacier melt more typical of\ntemperate glaciers. Preobrazhensky (1960) reports similar\nvalues for the summers of 1958 and 1959. Oerlemans (1993)\nexplains the higher sensitivity of glaciers located in wetter\nregions as being a consequence of the lower elevations of\nglacier tongues and, consequently, higher temperatures.\nAzarova glacier (as well as other glaciers in the Kodar) is\npositioned at low elevations, and thus experiences compara-\ntively high net radiation and air temperatures in summer. Its\nstrongly negative mass balance indicates high sensitivity to\nclimatic warming, enhanced by a diminishing fraction of\nsnowfall in the warm season, and a limited compensating\neffect of cold-season precipitation.\nFuture climate projections indicate a strong warming in\nJuly\u2013August under the moderate B2 and aggressive A2\nscenarios (Fig. 8a). Importantly, June temperatures will\nincrease by 2.68C and 4.78C under these two scenarios,\nresulting in positive temperatures at the glacier tongue\naltitude. Furthermore, September temperatures will increase\nby 4.48C and 5.98C (Fig. 8a) and these shifts will affect the\nlength of the ablation season which will extend into June\nand the first half of September. The annual amount of solid\nprecipitation will increase relative to the baseline period\nunder the B2 scenario by 20%. This increase is projected for\nOctober\u2013May, and half of it will occur in three months:\nApril, early May, and October. Under the A2 scenario, an\n8% increase in solid precipitation will occur between\nNovember and March, but cold-season precipitation will\nremain relatively low, with monthly totals of 42\u201378mm.\nA decline in solid precipitation projected for May, June and\nSeptember will result in a decrease in the annual solid\nprecipitation total by 3%. The difference between projected\ntrends for solid precipitation, resulting from different rates of\nwarming, is an important finding because of its potential\nimpacts on future glacier change. Results of previous\nmodelling studies suggest that a 20% increase in annual\nsolid precipitation does not compensate the impacts of\n3\u201358C warming on glaciers gaining mass though snow\naccumulation (Oerlemans, 1993; Braithwaite and others,\n2002). However, the impact of such a warming on glaciers\nthat predominantly gain mass through refreezing requires\nfurther investigation.\nComparison to other Siberian regions\nThe observed 20\u00036.9% shrinkage of Azarova between\n1979 and 2007 is in line with an average shrinkage of\nsimilar-sized (0.5\u20131 km2) glaciers in the Russian Altai\n(Shahgedanova and others, 2010). The small Altai glaciers\nlost 28\u00036% of their surface area between 1952 and 2004,\nbut analysis of ground-based measurements of glacier front\nfluctuations confirmed that most of this retreat occurred after\nthe mid-1970s (Shahgedanova and others, 2010). From 1979\nto 2007, the average glaciological mass balances of Maliy\nAktru and Leviy Aktru, in the Altai, were \u201395 and\n\u2013133mmw.e. a\u20131, respectively (WGMS, 2007 and earlier\nvolumes). Geodetic and glaciological mass-balance meas-\nurements are subject to different instrumental and physical\nbiases (Cogley, 2009), but these are likely to be smaller than\nFig. 8. The regional air temperature (a), precipitation intensity (b)\nand solid precipitation fraction (c) scenarios for the Kodar\nmountains (56.5\u201357.58N, 117\u20131188 E).\nShahgedanova and others: Geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier 135\nthe observed differences between these regions. Indeed,\nmost of the difference between the strongly negative mass\nbalance of Azarova and the Aktru glaciers is likely to result\nfrom the higher elevation of the Aktru glaciers (2000\u2013\n4000ma.s.l.).\nIn another glaciated Siberian massif, the Suntar-Khayata,\nglaciers lost 19% of their surface area between 1957 and\n2003 (Ananicheva, 2006). This rate of glacier wastage\nappears to be more comparable to Azarova, but it is possible\nthat results for the Suntar-Khayata are overestimated due to\nuse of the 1957 WGI data. The use of the WGI data was\npreviously found to result in an overestimation of glacier\nshrinkage in different regions (e.g. by 5% in the Altai\n(Shahgedanova and others, 2010) and by 16% in the Polar\nUrals (ongoing analysis)). Indeed, the 1963 area of Azarova is\nreported by the WGI as 1.3 km2 including the area of dead\nice located in front of the glacier (Novikova and others,\n1972). A slower rate of glacier shrinkage in the Suntar-\nKhayata is suggested by other measurements. For example,\nglacier thinning on glacier no. 31 averaged 10m for the\n1957\u20132003 period, where the mass balance was estimated at\n\u2013206mmw.e. a\u20131 (Ananicheva, 2006), i.e. three times lower\nthan the average mass balance of Azarova glacier in 1979\u2013\n2007. Even slower glacier wastage of glacier surface area was\nreported in the Buordakh massif of the Chersky mountains by\nGurney and others (2008). There, the extent of 80 glaciers\nwas measured and it was reported that 38% have not\nundergone a measurable retreat since 1850, although most\nglaciers exhibited signs of downwasting (Gurney and others,\n2008). Glaciers of both the Suntar-Khayata mountains\n(61.5\u2013638N, 139\u20131438 E) and Buordakh massif (658120N,\n1458560 E) are located further north and at higher elevations\n(extending to 2800\u20133000ma.s.l.) than Azarova. They are\ntherefore exposed to lower summer temperatures, as\nindicated by continuous observations at the regular meteoro-\nlogical stations (Shahgedanova, 2002) and by episodic\nobservations in the glaciated areas (Ananicheva, 2006).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe cold-based glaciers of Siberia have received little\nattention in the literature, partly due to their remote location\nand partly due to the notion that they are less sensitive to\nclimatic perturbations compared to more maritime glaciers\n(Dyurgerov and Meier, 2000; Braithwaite and others, 2002).\nHowever, analyses of changes in area and volume and\ncalculations of geodetic mass balance of Azarova glacier\nappear to question this latter assumption. Our results have\nshown that this glacier responded strongly to a 18C increase\nin summer temperatures between 1979 and 2007. The\nsurface area of the glacier declined by 20\u0003 6.9% and\nsurface lowering occurred across the whole glacier, aver-\naging 20\u00031.8m. This resulted in a strongly negative mass\nbalance of 640\u0003 60mmw.e. a\u20131.\nAzarova glacier, in common with other glaciers in this\nregion, is located in a deep valley, has a northerly aspect and\nreceives significant avalanche nourishment. Given these\ntopographic characteristics and the short ablation season\ninterrupted by snowfalls, these glaciers are likely to be better\n\u2018protected\u2019 from climate warming, compared to other\nglaciers that may be more exposed. However, the strongly\nnegative mass balance of Azarova and its significant\ndownwasting, even at its highest elevations, suggest that\nthese local effects do not counteract the impacts of\nincreasing summer temperatures and declining solid\nprecipitation. Future climate projections indicate that by\n2071\u20132100, summer temperatures will increase by 3\u201368C\ncompared with the 1961\u201390 period. This is likely to\nrepresent a serious challenge to glacier viability within the\n21st century, although this will also depend on future\nchanges in solid precipitation, which are more uncertain\nthan temperature. As such, modelling the sensitivity of\nAzarova glacier mass balance to climatic warming and to\nincreases in solid precipitation projected under the moder-\nate B2 scenario is planned as a next step in this research.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to V.M.
