It proposes that theoretical and \npolemical understandings of \u201cFrench feminism\u201d have been founded on an opposition to its \ncounterpart \u201cAnglo-American feminism\u201d. The measure of this opposition has been defined \nmostly as geographical, linguistic and cultural. But underneath such constructions often lies \nthe old sameness versus difference debate that has captivated feminism since the \nsuffragettes. This essay argues for a less oppositional and less discounting definition of the \ntwo strands of feminism. It proposes to read oppositional classifications as: motivation for a \ndialogue addressed to the \u201cother\u201d of theoretical constructs; questioning the likelihood of \nforgoing oppositional classification. \n \n \nKey words \nAnglo-American, French, feminism, other (otherness), difference. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \nFrench Feminism: A Re-construction\ni\n \n \nIs there such a thing as \u201cFrench feminism\u201d? Judging by the growing amount of texts using the \nterm, undoubtedly \u201cFrench feminism\u201d has entered the annals of scholastic terminology. It has \nbecome a self-explanatory expression that the sentient recognise as a coded referent, \nsignalling the users\u201f inclusion in a certain way of thinking. It signals belonging and it signals \nan existing intellectual tradition. To conceive of French feminism as a \u201ctradition\u201d implies that \nthe term has gained momentum and recognition. Yet, this is far from a true representation if \nwe consider the vehement and fertile exchanges that have gathered and opposed the so-\ncalled French feminists and their critics. A taster of such exchanges could go as follows. The \nFrench feminists\u201f \u201cwoman\u201d, excluded from masculine discourse, is at best the other of man\u201fs \nsymbols. A nothing or a mystic figure, her language defies comprehension, and confirms her \nas the marginal and impotent of discourse. Decidedly of western extraction, the French \nfeminist \u201cwoman\u201d is locked in an either\/or of \u201ethe idealistic tendency of structuralist thought \n[ignoring] the historical\/social specificity of language structures.\u201f (Nye, 1986: 51). The Anglo-\nAmerican feminists\u201f views on \u201cwoman\u201d are equally damming. Founded upon \u201ethe American \ninterest in the self; the British emphasis on class [\u2026] puritanical and work-oriented\u201f (Stanford-\nFriedman, 1993: 249), the Anglo-American feminist \u201cwoman\u201d lacks originality. Her structure \noccasionally chimes with phallocentric and her style conveys a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. But, leaving \nthe sometimes acerbic arguments on the back-bench, both sides agree on one thing: French \nfeminism is not the sum of its parts, it is not French and it is not feminism. Yet, the term sticks \nabove such terms as \u201ethird wave feminism\u201f, \u201epost-feminism\u201f, \u201epost-structuralist feminist literary \ntheory\u201f, etc. Even if they are not entirely equivalent, these terms are often interchangeable as \nthey point to a different theoretical emphasis on something post, something past, something \nthat comes after. After what? After the hard-core ideals of the feminist struggle. We would be \ndealing with the aftermath of feminism because, some believe, feminism is dead, feminism \nhas reached its end and achieved its objectives. And yet, with front-page headlines such as \n\u201eWomen now paid 30% less. Scandal as pay gap with men reaches a record 25-year high.\u201f \n(Daily Express, 01 June 2004), it does not take much ingenuity to perceive that even very \nearly feminist equal opportunity objectives which, by virtue of being quantifiable, may appear \n 2 \nless complicated to carry through, are far from having been achieved. Moreover, with captions \nasking readers to phone-vote on \u201eShould women get same pay as men?\u201f (Daily Express, 01 \nJune 2004, p 12), it appears that the very spirit of equal opportunity, elicited by Suffragettes \nfrom the mid-1860s onwards, has still not been assimilated by some of our twenty-first \ncentury constituents. So, while some claim feminism is pass\u00e9, unsurprisingly, others claim \nfeminism has failed to deliver the promised post-patriarchal land it announced. To evaluate \nsuch a bleak prognosis in such a short space would not do justice to the extra ordinary \nrevolution that feminism has been and still is. As a starting point, I will now emphasise one \naspect of feminist history (the sameness and difference debate) that strikes me as significant \nin understanding French feminist thought. \n \n \nThe first two waves of the feminist struggle are historically typified first by a call for the equal \ntreatment of women with regards to civic and social rights and second by the recognition of \nwomen\u201fs right to difference. In the first instance, the claim to equality was founded upon a \nlogic of sameness whereby since women are as rational as men, society carries a duty to give \nits female citizens equal opportunity to take part in social organisation: education, suffrage, \netc. Early feminists thus elicited the debate \u201eequality versus difference\u201f that would from then \non be at the core of feminist debates. Early views centred round the assimilation of woman to \nman, effectively encouraging woman to become like man in character (rational, pro-active, \nresponsible, etc.) while otherwise retaining her femininity (caring, maternal, supportive, etc). \nBut the assimilation of woman to man and the subservience of her feminine condition to the \nadvancement of man soon became the target of criticism for a second wave of feminists who, \nthanks to the hard work of early feminists, were now educated, better represented in the work \nplace, in the political arena, etc, in a word equipped to challenge the ideology of patriarchal \norganisation. \nSecond-wave feminists rejected early feminists\u201f bid for equality on the ground that equality \neffectively encouraged women to see themselves with a man\u201fs eyes. Equality could be gained \non the condition that woman be gauged with the same criteria that defined man. In short, \nequal to man meant same as man. Outside this model, women were still denied visibility and \n 3 \nrecognition. Second-wave feminists defied the patriarchal status quo by declaring woman \ndifferent. Different from what? Different from the woman she was as the counterpart of man, \nwith different needs, different sensitivity, different modes of expression, etc. than those man \nhad defined for her. These feminists efficiently theorised woman\u201fs situation. They proved that \nwoman was used as the invisible thread that keeps the patriarchal social fabric together, and \nthat this position was far from gratifying, let alone fulfilling her (Kate Millett, Betty Friedan, \nGermaine Greer for instance). Discontented with such misrepresentation and mistreatment, \nwoman would, from then on, do her own defining. To this effect, second-wave feminists used \nradical measures (hence \u201cradical feminism\u201d) and did a spectacular job in pulling this different \nwoman out of her closet by giving her difference substance. A distinctly female authorship \nwas salvaged from the scraps of mainstream literature and promoted as part of a historicizing \nof women\u201fs literary achievement (for instance Virago Press). Women authors wrote more \nsystematically about women\u201fs experience, making audible a consciousness that had \npreviously been kept silent. The English language, construed as a man-made language (Dale \nSpender) became a terrain of investigation of women\u201fs oppression and some (Suzette \nHaden-Elgin) suggested that the creation of a language to accommodate for specific female \nexperience would change women\u201fs lives (this idea survives in policies of political \ncorrectness). \nHowever, as radical feminism progressed, so did the formalisation of the difference debate, \npitching opposing theoretical factions against each other. Disputes amongst feminists show \nthat although the move to promoting women\u201fs difference was animated by a genuine desire to \ncreate a sisterhood where women might find legitimacy, this sisterhood was itself struggling to \nunify the desires of all its members. Initially steered by white, middle-class, heterosexual \nwomen, issues of class, race, sexuality, etc, divided the movement and sub-groups emerged \nto account for those differences, for instance black feminism, lesbian feminism, etc. These \nsub-groups testified to the dissatisfaction with the assimilation of woman to her \u201cdifference\u201d \nbecause assimilation also homogenised all women to a \u201csameness in difference\u201d. Hence the \ninitial dissatisfaction with the assimilation of woman to the dominant discourse and with her \nsubservience to the advancement of that dominant group was disappointingly repeated within \nthe movement. \n 4 \nThe argument for the failure or even end of feminism usually refers to this turbulent time of \ninternal disagreements. Yet, the issue of sameness\/difference, far from being dead or pass\u00e9, \nwould go through further theoretical phases where men and women would be scrutinised for \nbiological, psychological, behavioural, environmental similarities and differences that would \njustify (or refute), explain (or confuse), the existence of the categories man and woman. As \nthe formalisation of the sameness\/difference continued, so new schools of feminist thought \nwere created. It is a tribute to the movement that the division of opinion and the splintering of \n\u201cfeminism\u201d into what could be called feminist \u201cspecialism\u201d has not translated into the demise \nof feminism but its transformation and diversification. However, the increased formalisation \nand specialisation of feminist thought has also intellectualised the debate and made its former \nbra-burning, slogan-brandishing presence less pronounced. In a culture where visibility often \nrhymes with media spectacle, the perception that feminism is pass\u00e9 is also to be attributed to \nits discretion. Finally, it seems to me that the perception that militant feminism has \n\u201cdisappeared\u201d from the social arena is due to the redistribution of many of its causes in non-\nfeminist identified areas of social reform. Equal opportunity, political correctness, diversity \nawareness, parity, etc are today\u201fs catch phrases that hide behind them the continuation of \ncontemporary feminist militantism.  \n \nThird-wave feminism takes its place in this context of increased intellectualisation of the \ndebate. The debate over sameness\/difference has moved away from confrontational means \nof gaining social reform and towards a more academic style. Third-wave feminists are \ninvested in articulating theories explaining why, in spite of the work done, the debate persists \nand how to transcend it.  \nAlice Jardine (1982) and Toril Moi (1985) are largely responsible for the use of the term \n\u201cFrench feminism\u201d, the one for the coining of the term and the other for further limiting its use \nto a few selected authors. In her famous article Gynesis, Jardine detected the emergence of \nFrench feminist thought out of the intellectual scene of 1980s France. Characterised by the \ndawn of what has been termed \u201cmodernity\u201d or \u201cpost-modernism\u201d, French theorists were \ninvested in theorising the failure of the modernist project and moving its failed dialectic \ntowards new theoretical horizons. For the feminist project, this translated in re-visiting the \n 5 \ndebate over sameness and difference. As for Toril Moi, the publication of her Sexual\/Textual \nPolitics (1985) officialised a division between Anglo-American feminists and French feminists. \nAnglo-American feminists (Kate Millett, Virginia Woolf, Elaine Showalter) would be invested in \nseeking a woman-centred perspective and in defining a woman identity they believe women \nhave been denied. French feminists (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva) on the \nother hand would be indebted to Simone de Beauvoir and would believe that woman does not \nhave an identity as such but that the feminine can be identified where difference and \notherness are found. Today, the term French feminism is commonly used in Anglo-American \nliterary circles. It is this packaging of adoption of the term \u201cFrench feminism\u201d and how it \ncontributes to the sameness\/difference debate that this essay will now address. \n \n \nMost researchers (Delphy, Lechte, Smith, Moi, etc) concur on the idea that French feminism \nis an Anglo-American invention. They argue that its purpose is to commodify, behind the \nqualifier \u201cFrench\u201d, this evanescent part of continental thought for domestic consumption.  \nGeographical fencing off (identifying separate French and Anglo-American feminisms), would \nbe a metaphoric fencing off of two distinct ideologies. On the one hand, Anglo-American \nfeminism denotes a geographical limit. More than this, \u201cAnglo-American\u201d pertains to a \nlinguistic tradition that does not seem to concern \u201cFrench\u201d. The United States and the United \nKingdom share, since the Reagan\/Thatcher years, this \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that transcends a \nmere common language. \u201cFrench\u201d thought on the other hand does not necessarily include \nFrench-speaking countries other than France and certainly does not imply the grouping of two \nor more national territories according to linguistic and political privileging. A famous example \nis found in Moi who defines as the \u201eHoly trinity\u201f of French feminist theory three women \n(Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous) who are respectively Belgian, Bulgarian and French pied noir. If \nFrench feminism does not necessarily include French natives, it does include thinkers of a \ncommon intellectual tradition. But this common intellectual tradition is defined from without. \nFrench feminism is \u201ea body of comments by Anglo-American writers on a selection of French \nand non-French writers: Lacan, Freud, Kristeva, Cixous, Derrida and Irigaray are the core \ngroups. But there are others.\u201f (Delphy, 2000: 172). Though not all of them French, and \n 6 \nleaving Freud aside for now, they do have in common the French language as their elected \nmode of expression. This may not simply be intellectual arrogance, reserving French thought \nfor the conversants into the riddles of the continental post-structuralist linguistic games. \nKristeva expressed this clearly when she stated that \u201e[f]oreigners must confront a ghost from \nthe past that remains hidden in a secret part of themselves\u201f (Guberman, 1996: 4). In choosing \nto express themselves in a foreign language, these theorists are also giving themselves a tool \nto tap into archaic contents of the subject\u201fs being.  \nKristeva also stresses that we all carry memories of childhood connected with places, \ntheir colours, smells and sounds, and that the reason for which these recollections are \noften hazy is that we find it difficult to express them in words: as adults, we have lost \ntouch with the language of childhood. A foreign language can help us translate those \nearly impressions of the world into words because it is more distanced from them than \nour mother tongue is. It is for this reason that Kristeva found her analysis, which was \nconducted in French, helpful in transposing her images of childhood onto her new \nculture. (Cavallero, 2003: 144-5) \n \nIndeed the distance French provides to these \u201cforeign\u201d French feminists enables them to deal \nwith and represent pre-Oedipal contents. But protection through linguistic distancing is not the \nsole motivation for gathering around the French language. Connections between the \nlanguage and other issues like translation, otherness and oppression are embedded in the \nlanguage. \u201cForeign\u201d French feminists and Anglo-American critics\u201f absorbtion with French \nbears significance even more visibly when their choice to read or speak French is not the \nfortuitous consequence of having been brought up into a language. It is interesting to pause \non the history of the French language and specifically on its long-lived association with power \nstruggles, won and lost. I am not suggesting that such an association is the apanage of \nFrench since linguistic empirialism has long been a recognised weapon of colonisation and \nsubmission of the one culture by the other. But I am emphasising the fact that France and the \nFrench language have a long history as linguistic oppressor and oppressed and that this \nimplicit history is also part of the lure to French of a certain intellectual practice.  \n \nThe use of the French language was first made compulsory by Hugues Capet (10\nth\n century) \nas part of the government\u201fs effort to absorb southern provinces to the Duchy of Paris. The \nlangue d\u2019o\u00efl, the dialect of Paris then became the official language, effectively causing the \ndemise of languages spoken south of the Loire river until their revival in the mid-19\nth\n century \nin an attempt to assert a regional Occitan identity (Proven\u00e7al, Catalan for instance). While \n 7 \n\u201eminor\u201f languages have been restored, the government is at the same time fighting for the \nsurvival of the French language in France, in a globalising context where linguistic supremacy \nis driven by the market economy. I am thinking of the Toubon Law for instance which imposes \nthe compulsory but not exclusive use of French on certain documents (consumer goods, \ninstruction manuals, advertisments). The Body Shop was famously the first company to be \nfined in 1996 for failing to comply with the Toubon linguistic rule. So the French language has \nhistorically oscillated between weapon and recipient of linguistic oppression. We may further \nhypothetise that more recent socio-political events help explain why the French linguistic \ncontext may be prosperous to a certain type of thought.  \nFrench has become one of the languages to express ideas of difference par excellence. The \nclaim for France\u201fs position as the champion of \u201cdifference\u201d was initiated under the Mitt\u00e9rand \ngovernment. But the idea arches back to the French Revolution. 1789 is seen as the turning \npoint, when a change of focus is observed in philosophy, literature, politics, etc. Eighteenth \ncentury values had failed to bring social happiness and ended in bloodshed. Social and \npolitical unrest, rapid technological advances, the rejection of rationality in favour of emotions, \netc, translated in a move away from collective concerns to that of the individual and his\/her \nsingularity. Hence, the use of French as the language of predilection by theorists of French \nthrought (not necessarily French themselves) is no coincidence.  \nIf France sponsors a tradition of difference, the clash between French and Anglo-American \nthinkers is not surprising. Could the use of the French language also be a defensive linguistic \nresponse against the feared American linguistic imperialism trading even closer by virtue of \nthe British alliance with the cultural giant? If there is a withering away of language, as Kristeva \nproposed, and of the French language and culture in particular, one response \u201econsists in \nturning back toward tradition in a loving, proud, reactive, nostalgic fashion\u201f (Guberman, 1996: \n169). Another, as I explained elsewhere\nii\n, privileges the subversion of text over protectionist \nmeasures. French feminism, feminism in French then, is a reactive and subversive response. \nFrench feminist strategy is not as a-political as many Anglo-American feminists would have it. \nIts socio-political engagement can be extrapolated from this: the use of a receding language \nis the means by which they destabilise, escape the grip of dominant ideology and ultimately \ncoerce this dominant ideology to reckon with issues of marginalisation. The irritation of Anglo-\n 8 \nAmerican feminists is understandable. But in the battle for linguistic authority, so is the \nirritation of French feminists at the Anglo-American label. For reactive and subversive \nstrategies go beyond a mere attack on geographical and linguistic imperialism. Issues of \nnational or linguistic dominance should be read as the symptom of a much wider problematic \nthat interests French feminists: that of representation, or more precisely, re-presentation as \nthe secondary presentation of a primary process. This leads us to the issue of translation and \nwe can now return to the place given to Freud in French feminist theory and make a few \nremarks on his contribution. \n \nFreud\u201fs position has prime significance in the context of French feminism and pre-Oedipality. \nFreud historically precedes all other French feminist thinkers. Freud acts as a referent. Freud \nis the link to a shared fascination for a certain conception of consciousness that can be traced \nback to his tradition. French feminism is also post-Freudian feminism. The Anglo-American \nreadership of a post-Millettian persuasion is undoubtedly suspicious if not averse to such \nacceptance of the paternalist enemy\niii\n. This is in some ways justified, but also partly a mis-\nreading of those French feminists. In theorising representation of the individual, French \nfeminist thinkers have in common their interest in pre-Oedipality. Representation of the \nmaternal experience typifies French feminism. It also draws them apart. From the search for a \nspecifically feminine mode of representation to the protective holding on to the symbolic as \nthe ticket to safety, French feminist narratives tell of a questioning addressed to the paternal \nand to the maternal. From sub-versive to re-active then, French feminist representation \noscillates between dissidence from and compliance to the patriarchal letter.  \nTo the dismay of Anglo-American feminists, dissidence is not spelt out in the narrative. \nDissidence is in the confusion and ambiguity of expression and must be extrapolated. We are \nin the grips of translation on several levels. First, to express oneself in a foreign language is to \nspeak another language. The leap from foreign languages as the language of the others, to \nforeign language as the language of foreignity or otherness is easily made. Hence a first \nmeaning of translation is found is this Freudian reading of leap from other to proper self, from \npre-oedipal to symbolic, from maternal to paternal, etc. Second, the confusion or ambiguity \npresent in the French text leaves the English translator with the ungrateful task of making \n 9 \nchoices: fixing the other, the pre-oedipal, the maternal with linguistic symbols (interpreting \nwhile translating); translating the ambuiguity with the use of slash symbols (for example \nf\u00e9minin becomes feminine\/female); re-writing the text in English and using the ambiguity of \nthe English language to make a point (Nicole Ward-Jouve does this for instance). \nThat translation dissolves, alters and reforms meanings is nothing new. But the agency of \ntranslation (or of the translator) perhaps has not been emphasised enough. \u201eOne cannot \nignore issues of translation and cultural difference in the representation of a writer\u201fs thought.\u201f \n(Smith, 1998: 5) Smith exclaims. Indeed, translation demands that we address these two \naspects of its practice. French feminists are attached to the French language as the privileged \nspace where they construct meaning. This is significant as we have seen earlier. English \ntranslators distort that construction and, with or without their approval, impose an Anglo-\nAmerican identity upon French feminists. There is a tendency to assume the equivalence of \nthe French and English languages, equalling their differences to a kind of transcendental \nreality of meaning, a transcendence both languages would be subject to. At times, this has \nled to aberrant interpretations founded, not so much on a poignant analysis of text, but on the \nindiscriminate analysis of the translated text. I am regularly reminded of this difficulty when \nperplexed students attempt the perilous task of making sense of \u201cthe feminine\u201d. There is \nfeminine (a socio-political reality) and there is feminine (a positioning of identity). In fact, both \nmeanings are diametrically opposed. From a feminist perspective, the socio-political feminine \nis on the side of patriarchal representation of \u201cwoman\u201d while the \u201cpositioned\u201d feminine is on \nthe side of the non-verbal, or the trans-verbal, if we are lucky. In Lacan\u201fs infamous \u201cwoman is \nnot\u201d, the metaphoric woman is in the void, absence, invisibility, the in-between of language. \nThe sexism of such a remark is not in the suggestion that under patriarchal analogy, women \ndo not exist symbolically but in arresting thought at that.  Luckily, authors like Cixous rescue \nthe Lacanian sentence by showing the possibility to create those in-betweens as literary \npractice. Although woman is still absent or invisible, she is now intentionally created. So \nlanguage, once decried as \u201cman-made\u201d (Spender) can now be effected, against Lacan, to \n\u201cmake woman\u201d.  \nThe difficulty with such a practice is to work on two opposite registers at once. When H\u00e9l\u00e8ne \nCixous writes of \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine or of the other bisexuality, she works on two levels: a literal \n 10 \nlevel and a metaphoric level. Susan Sellers sums it up: \u201ewe all continually fluctuate between \ngender roles, sometimes assuming defensive, \u201cmasculine\u201d positions, at other times willing to \nrisk prohibition, and at other times combining elements of each.\u201f (Sellers, 1994: xxviii) Yet, \nSellers\u201f statement is still too organised, too phallogocentric, too much of a remark founded on \nthe differentiation of meaning whereby, although we are offered three terms, one is either \nmasculine or feminine or a combination. Cixous\u201fs expression is an either\/or and all of those at \nonce. It expresses at the same time meaning as the outcome of differentiation and meaning \nas \u201ethe non-exclusion of difference\u201f (Cixous in Sellers, 1994: 41). Freud taught us that \ndifference is founded on exclusion and that the excluded must be the mother.  Cixous \nemphasises another difference, difference without exclusion, difference before exclusion: \nI will never say often enough that the difference is not one, that there is never one \nwithout the other, and that the charm of difference (beginning with sexual difference) is \nthat it passes. It crosses through us, like a goddess. We cannot capture it. It makes us \nteeter with emotion. It is in this living agitation that there is always room for you in me, \nyour presence and your place. I is never an individual. I is haunted. I is always. Before \nknowing anything, an I-love-you. (Cixous in Sellers, 1994: xviii) \n \nThe other bisexuality is both the reunion after castration of the two halves elicited by Ovid\niv\n \nand \u201ethe location within oneself of the presence of both sexes\u201f (Cixous in Sellers, 1994: 41) \nbefore sexual difference, before the knowledge that one can be cut. So, \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine is: \nan essentialist idea for which only those endowed with a female body have the potential; a \nsocially determined idea whereby femininity is a re-constructed psychical positioning open to \nall; both at once.  \nIt seems then puzzling that from a desire to \u201einscribe difference at the heart of the universal\u201f \n(Kristeva in Guberman, 1996: 269), French feminists are regularly accused of essentialism. \nThis is especially true of Kristeva whose attachment to the Oedipal model has alarmed \nfeminists, raised suspicion as to her motivations and provoked virulent responses to her \nmessage. Her strategy is always to rehabilitate the shattered subject of the \u201ecrumbling social \ncontract\u201f (Kristeva, 1974: 224) through the \u201esearch for [its] legitimisation through the paternal \nfunction\u201f (Kristeva, 1974: 224). Does this entail the betrayal of the feminist cause? For the \nlegitimisation of the social subject necessarily means the repression of the feminine. Kristeva \nhas defended herself, accusing Anglo-American feminist theorists in particular of perpetrating \n\u201eunconsciously the very oppositions they are trying to undo\u201f (Kristeva in Guberman, 1996: \n107).  \n 11 \nI believe that much of what has been written in the United States about my conception \nhas been inaccurate. People have either defined and glorified the \u201csemiotic\u201d as if it \nwere a female essence or else claimed that I do not grant enough autonomy to this \n\u201cessence\u201d, this \u201cdifference\u201d. I hear in such reductive statements traces of the old-age \ndebate between \u201cuniversalists\u201d and the \u201cdifferentialists\u201d. (Kristeva in Guberman, 1996: \n269) \n \nThe attack on liberal (universalist) and radical (differentialist) feminists is explicit and \nunderstandable. The trapping of Kristevan thought into an either\/or dialectic makes it difficult \nto rescue the Kristevan project, unless we reconsider it from the perspective suggested by \nCixous of difference before exclusion.  We find it explicitly in Kristeva also, under the guise of \nthe \u201cmaternal function\u201d or the \u201cwoman effect\u201d.  \n[It] entails a specific relationship to both power and language or, if you will, to the power \nof language. This particular relationship is based not on appropriating power and \nlanguage, but on being a source of silent support, a useful backdrop, and an invisible \nintermediary, (Kristeva in Guberman, 1996: 104) \n \nSilent, supportive, useful, invisible, in-between\u2026 This is hardly a glorifying image of women\u201fs \nsocial role. But Kristeva is not simply talking about biological women. \u201cMaternal\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d \nrefer, as in Cixous, to a time anterior to paternal castration, a moment when antinomic worlds \ncan co-exist without shattering one another. This is an experience the future subject \ninternalises and which presence will make itself felt in a certain type of expression: poiesis, \n\u00e9criture feminine, etc. What hinders the assimilation of such terminology is the confusion \nbetween two registers pertaining to two experiences: that of the pre-societal and that of social \norganisation. The capture of \u201cmaternal\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d in and as the body of woman is a \n\u201esymbolic effect of the way the subject experiences social cohesiveness, power and language\u201f \n(Kristeva in Guberman, 1996: 104). It is the way society requires we organise ourselves as \nsocial members. For the French feminist, destroying the patriarchal markers of such a \npassage from pre-social to social does not fundamentally change the problem. We may \nchoose to discard the lipstick or cultivate a revolutionary Greenham Common style image for \n\u201cwoman\u201d, this still points to a symbolic evocation of \u201cwoman\u201d. The Anglo-American feminist\u201fs \nfrustration with French feminism can also be located here. If French feminists succeed in \ndemolishing all social action by reducing it to a \u201csymbolic effect\u201d of something other, what is \nthe alternative? Does the \u201einteriorisation of the founding separation of the sociosymbolic \ncontract\u201f (Kristeva in Belsey and Moore, 1990: 215) offer feminism any hope? \n 12 \nMy initial argument that the (mis)understanding of \u201cFrench feminism\u201d is a translation issue has \nthen slipped sideways. French thought is now an obstruction to capturing the picture. French \nfeminists are in the habit of holding antithetic propositions under one thesis. This does not \neasily pass the translation barrier from the French to the English language. Translators of \nFrench feminist texts are time and time again faced with the difficult task of rendering the \nFrench feminist spirit \u201e[W]e have not made the effort to create a seamless, smooth American \nEnglish text\u201f, one translator comments (Cixous, 1994b: xxvi). Instead, the translator seeks \u201eto \nmake the familiar uncanny\u201f (evoking the Freudian Unheimlich), \u201ethe translation ought to aim at \nthis sort of d\u00e9paysement\u201f. (Cixous, 1994b: xxvi). Anne-Marie Smith (1998) and John Lechte \n(1990) have suggested that the difficult passage from French into English may be more of a \ncultural difficulty, indeed a d\u00e9paysement, than an actual translation barrier. \n \nSmith proposes that Anglo-American thought demands of theory that it be testable  \nFreud is certainly in a more comfortable position in France than in Britain or the United \nStates, where in the wake of the recent vituperative indictment of Freud, written by the \nAmerican intellectual Frederick Crews, the national, liberal press has entered into a \ntrend which, setting psychoanalysis against the demands of empiricism, attempts to \ndisprove its theories as non-scientific. The French Lacanian tradition reads Freud as a \nstudy of language [\u2026]. (Smith, 1998: 8)  \n \nThe main difference between French and Anglo-American intellectual cultures comes down to \na difference in the way the Freudian message has been received. Smith\u201fs packaging of \nAnglo-American psychoanalytic thought is in itself questionable in the light of the diversity of \nreadings (I am thinking of the distinguished post-Kleinian British School of Object Relation \nTheory). John Lechte overcomes this when he observes that the cultural difference is not so \nmuch a French versus Anglo-American conflict but the stumbling upon a limitation in rational \nthought.   \nThe limit of phenomenological research is that it always, and inevitably, refers back to \nan ultimate unity, a posited subject of experience, a Cartesian subject in fact which is \nalready an \u201eI\u201f, already the result of the distinction between subject and object. (Lechte, \n1991: 134) \n \nThe divide pitches established frameworks of thought of a Cartesian persuasion against \nconception of the subject that exceed such frameworks. Although such persuasion partakes \nin the historical making that defines contemporary Western thought, it certainly cannot be \ntraced back to an Anglo-American cultural tradition. Rather, reading through Lechte, we are \n 13 \ndealing with an historical clash of cultures pitching proponents of the modernist project \nagainst the less peremptory discourses of late and post-modernism. In this sense, the issue is \nnot that Anglo-American theorists read Freud differently from French feminists but that they \nread Freud and French feminism with the same suspicion for their lack of a solid objective \nbase. As Smith notes, \n[T]here is an aspect of French cultural life in general which involves unabashed \navowals of desire and seduction and distinct forms of identification which a puritanical \nstreak in Anglo-American culture resists as narcissistic or uncritical and needs to turn \ninto either abstractions or plain speech. (Smith, 1998: 8)  \n \nFrench feminism reiterates after Freud a message of estrangement from the motherland. This \nspace of estrangement, of d\u00e9paysement then, is in fact what French feminists constantly flirt \nwith and what Anglo-American culture defends itself against.  \nThere is a staging of sensory pleasure which is not always considered politically \ncorrect, or critical, across the Channel or the Atlantic. This is a form of resistance which \ngoes far beyond distinguishing the package from the product and in the name of \ncritique translates itself as a refusal of seduction, and an obsessional defence against \nhysteria of foreignness and femininity. This sort of defensiveness is of course at the \nbasis of any serious critical work but it is also a measure of cultural difference which is \nplayed out, I would argue, in relation to the question of seduction and resistance, just \nas xenophobia and misogyny are extreme examples of defences against the lure of \nforeignness or femininity.\u201f (Smith, 1998: 9) \n \nSmith\u201fs statement clearly proposes a dualistic relationship between the two poles of feminist \ncriticism, divided by a political or geographical barrier. Interestingly her choice of geographical \ndivide, the sea or ocean, fits the purpose of her message that it is something along the lines \nof the maternal, hysteria, foreignness, femininity, that separates the two. That this should be \nplayed out as a xenophobic singling-out of French feminism would entail, if we follow her lead, \nAnglo-American feminists\u201f defence against the maternal, the feminine, etc. In other words, \nAmerican critics would have invented \u201cFrench feminism\u201d to express ideas unpalatable for \nAmerican domestic consumption under the cover of \u201cforeign theory\u201d. \n \nIf we go along with this, it would mean that Anglo-American feminists have become the \noppressors, French feminists the oppressed. Are we then witnessing a repeat of feminist \nhistory with the old dialectic impossibility of accommodating difference within dominant \ndiscourse? All the ingredients are certainly here: the demands that discourses of difference \n(French feminism) be brought into line to comply with acceptable feminist discourse (Anglo-\nAmerican feminism); the complaint from French feminists that Anglo-American feminists do \n 14 \nnot understand and oppress them; etc. But while their respective narratives reveal a clash in \nmethods and objectives there are also crucial concessions granted theoretically on both \nsides.  \nFor psychoanalytically oriented French feminism, differentiation will be played out. Whether in \nsexism, racism, ageism, sexual orientation, or any other group, the existence of exclusion \nremains. The erasure or modification of categories such as sex, race, age, does not \nfundamentally change the outcome of exclusion, only the form it takes. Similarly, the \nsuspension of the differentiation theory will not suspend difference and by extension \nexclusion, sexual or otherwise. If exclusion is not permitted in one area, it will simply displace \nonto another. It is a small leap for French feminists to concede that differentiation will also be \nplayed out in feminism, that the fabrication of difference and of exclusion will occur no matter \nthe goodwill of (Anglo-American) discourse.  \nIn the view of the mounting Anglo-American interest in the French feminist approach, \nespecially with regards to their explanation of the psychical dynamics of exclusion that \nanimate every individual (Cavallaro, 2003), the construction of Anglo-American feminism as \nthe adversary of French feminism is not tenable. It is precisely their interest, which has \npermitted the dissemination of French feminist ideas beyond the circles of the Parisian elite. \nBut if Anglo-American interest is not malevolent, it is not benevolent or gratuitous either. \nSpivak (1981) has shown that interest in the \u201cother\u201d is rarely for the other\u201fs benefit but more \negotistically to gain a better understanding of oneself. She says \u201e[I]n spite of their occasional \ninterest in touching the other of the West, of metaphysics, of capitalism, their repeated \nquestion is obsessively self-centred: if we are not what official history and philosophy say we \nare, who then are we (not), how are we (not)?\u201f (Spivak, 1981: 158-9). As post-structuralist \ntheory has questioned the self-reflexive complacency of western history and philosophy, \ncategories they sought to explain have also been questioned. The subject, capitalist social \norganisation, etc. are being revisited, defended or vilified. But Spivak finds that this \nquestioning remains a self-reflexive exercise rather than it opens a dialogue with the other. \nThe other\u201fs vision \u201cothers me\u201d, voices the negative spaces of my being. So the discourse of \nthe other provides me with a fuller picture of the \u201chows\u201d and \u201cwhats\u201d of my invisible being. If \nwe apply Spivak\u201fs idea to the Anglo-American\/French debate, what interests Anglo-American \n 15 \ncritics, when it does not fascinate and anger them, is the space where French feminists deny \nAnglo-Americans an existence. Hence, one of the major appeals of and objections to French \nfeminism is the manner in which it supports theories of difference and cherishes issues of \notherness at the risk of idealising the notion of \u201cOther\u201d. For if the notional other loses its \ngrounding in any given socio-political reality, which \u201cother\u201d is being lost? The Anglo-American \nobjection to the creation of a utopian universalised Other would be an objection to being \nassimilated, as the other of French theory, to a theoretical construct lacking specificity and \nroots in social reality. French feminism would be inviting the dominant discourse to address \nissues of its own dissolution.  \n \n \nTo conclude, it may not be that Anglo-American feminists created French feminism and then \nused it to voice, under the cover of \u201cforeign theory\u201d, concerns impertinent to the dominant \nAnglo-American discourse. But, it may well be that some Anglo-American feminists, who after \na long battle had earned social, political and academic credence, suddenly found their secure \nbase vulnerable to theories of difference. Then, we would be justified in thinking that the so-\ncalled dialogue that has opened between the two types of feminisms remains for many Anglo-\nAmerican theorists a tool for self-study rather than an opportunity to address the notion of \notherness. I would however propose to question this dreary conclusion and finish on a more \npositive note.  \nFrench and Anglo-American feminisms cannot be reduced to geographical, cultural or \nlinguistic denotations. In effect, I hope to have demonstrated that they cannot be identified in \nisolation. From a political viewpoint, it seems that both sides are engaged in a power play at \nwho-will-dissolve-the-other. French feminism is inviting Anglo-American feminists to re-visit \ntheir comfortable position and Anglo-American feminism is teasing clarification out of French \nfeminists\u201f seductive linguistic enigmas. This essay has mostly emphasised the unsettling \neffect French feminism has on Anglo-American feminism, or rather the manner in which \nFrench feminism is construed as that which upsets the Anglo-American feminist edifice. The \nreverse could also have been argued. By placing itself as the other of otherness, Anglo-\nAmerican feminism is positing itself as guardian of the symbol, be it a feminist symbol, a \n 16 \nsomewhat ironic outcome. It would be equally interesting to analyse how much Anglo-\nAmerican feminism has re-enforced the inclination of French feminist discourse towards \nincarnating the discourse of otherness. By isolating and assuming the existence of French \nfeminist discourse, by adopting a sanctioning tone - feminist discourse must have a clear \npolitical agenda, must not be essentialist, etc.- Anglo-American feminism have, undoubtedly, \nignited and fuelled a debate. A less prohibitive and more inclusive analysis would conclude \nthat the constant crossing of the divide that separates these two particular poles of feminist \ncriticism has revived Western feminism, offering fertile exchanges and novel conceptions of \nsubjectivity and gender.   \n \n \nReferences \n-Belsey, Catherine and Moore, Jane (edd) (1990) The Feminist Reader: Essays in Gender \nand the Politics of Literary Criticism, London: MacMillan; first published 1989. \n-Cavallaro, Dani (2003) French Feminist Theory, London, New York: Continuum. \n-Cixous, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (1994) The Terrible but Unfinished Story of Norodom Shanouk, King of \nCambodia, Lincoln,London: University of Nebraska Press. \nDaily Express, 01 June 2004 \n-Delphy, Christine (2000) \u201eThe Invention of French Feminism: An Essentialist Move\u201f, Yale \nFrench Studies, No 97, 50 Years of Yale French Studies: A commemorative Anthology, Part \n2: 1980-1998 (2000), 166-97. \n-Fendler, Susanne & Wittlinger, Ruth (edd)  (1999) The Idea of Europe in Literature, London: \nMacmillan. \n-Fraser, Nancy (1990) \u201eThe Uses and Abuses of French Discourse Theories for Feminist \nPolitics\u201f, Boundary 2, Vol 17, No 2 (Summer 1990), 82-101. \n-Freud, Sigmund (2003) The Uncanny, London: Penguin \n-Guberman, Ross Mitchell (1996) Julia Kristeva: Interviews, New York: Columbia University \nPress. \n-Jardine, Alice (1982) \u201eGynesis\u201f, Diacritics, Vol 12, No 2, Cherchez la Femme Feminist \nCritique\/Feminine Text (Summer 1982), 54-65. \n 17 \n-Kristeva, Julia (1979) \u201eLe Temps des femmes\u201f, 34\/44: Cahier de recherche de sciences et \ndocuments, Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII, No 5; translated as \u201eWomen\u201fs Time\u201f in Belsey and Moore. \n-Lechte, John (1991) Julia Kristeva, London, New York: Routledge; first published 1990. \n-Moi, Toril  (1988) Sexual\/Textual Politics, London, New York: Routledge; first published \n1985. \n-Nye, Andrea (1986) \u201eFrench Feminism and Philosophy of Language\u201f, No\u00fbs, Vol 20, No 1, \nAPA Central Division Meetings (March 1986), 45-51. \n-Ovid (1968) Metamorphoses, London, Reading, Fakenham: Penguin Books; first published \n1955. \n-Sellers, Susan (ed) (1994) The H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous Reader, London, New York: Routledge. \n-Smith, Anne-Marie (1998) Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable, London, Sterling \n(Virginia): Pluto Press. \n-Spender, Dale (1980) Man Made Language, London, Boston, Sydney, Wellington: Pandora. \n-Spivak, Gayatri Chakravorty (1991) \u201eFrench Feminism in an International frame\u201f, Yale French \nStudies, No 62, Feminist Readings: French Texts\/American Contexts (1981), 154-84. \n-Stanford-Friedman, Susan (1993) \u201eRelational Epistemology and the Question of Anglo-\nAmerican Feminist Criticism\u201f, Tulsa Studies in Women\u2019s Literature, Vol 12, No 2 (Autumn, \n1993), 247-61. \n \n5429 words \nFebruary 2005 \n                                                     \ni\nMy thanks go to Jennie Finch for her help. \nii\nGambaudo in Fendler and Wittlinger (edd) (1999). \niii\nI am thinking about Kate Millett\u201fs seminal text Sexual Politics (specifically \u201eFreud and the \nInfluence of Psychoanalytic Thought\u201f and \u201eSome Post-Freudians\u201f), which fiercely exposed the \nsexism of the Freudian edifice.
