We present a case study of an omega band cur-\nrent system from 11 May 1998 using data from the Imaging\nRiometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) in Finland. For the\nfirst time, images of a substorm-related omega band in cos-\nmic noise absorption are shown. The substorm in question\nwas one of a string that occurred on that day; inspection of\ngeostationary satellite data indicates that this was a sawtooth\nevent. Using a previously established statistical relationship,\nthe IRIS data is used to provide maps of Hall conductance\nand compared with previous estimates utilising both HF and\nVHF coherent-scatter radars. Discrepancies are discussed\nwith reference to precipitation spectrum and the geometry of\nthe experimental set-up. The imaging riometer data provides\na higher spatial resolution than the combined magnetometer-\nradar pairing for determining the Hall conductance and can\nalso be used to identify the extent of the precipitation in the\nabsence of optical data.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Particle precipitation) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (Current systems; Magnetospheric configu-\nration and dynamics)\n1 Introduction\nThe precipitation of energetic (>30 keV) electrons in the au-\nroral zones is strongly connected to substorm activity and\nthe resulting enhanced electron density in the lower iono-\nsphere leads to cosmic noise absorption (CNA) which can\nbe used as a proxy for this precipitation. Measurements of\nCNA have often been used to study the precipitation dur-\ning and following substorm activity, both on the night side\nand the subsequent eastward drift of electrons in the inner\nmagnetosphere (e.g. Hargreaves et al., 1975, 1997; Ranta et\nal., 1981; Baker et al., 1981; Kavanagh et al., 2002; Span-\nCorrespondence to: A. J. Kavanagh\n(a.j.kavanagh@lancaster.ac.uk)\nswick et al., 2007). Around dawn CNA often displays pe-\nriodic variations in the mHz frequency range. Much of this\nstructure can be attributed to the modulation of precipitation\nby ULF (ultra low frequency) geomagnetic pulsations (e.g.\nSenior and Honary, 2003; Spanswick et al., 2005); how-\never, longer quasi-periodic structures that display eastward\nmotion at the convection speed also appear (e.g. Hargreaves\nand Berry, 1976; Kavanagh et al., 2002; Makarevitch et al.,\n2004). The exact cause of these structures is unknown and it\nis not clear whether the same process drives the long-period\nvariations in precipitation in all cases.\nOne potential cause of these precipitation structures is the\npropagation of auroral omega bands, which occur during the\nrecovery phase of substorms (Akasofu, 1974; Saito, 1978;\nRostoker and Barichello, 1980). These are eastward drifting\n(Luhr and Schlegal, 1994) current systems that are mostly\n(but not strictly) stationary in time (Amm et al., 2005) and\nwhich produce luminous auroral tongues, the dark gaps be-\ntween forming the shape of an inverted  (hence the name).\nPassage of the current system generate magnetic pulsations\non the ground (Saito, 1978; Kawasaki and Rostoker, 1979;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1983) that are observed by magnetome-\nters as Ps6 pulsations (period = 5\u201340 min), dominant in\nthe azimuthal component, caused by the formation of Hall\ncurrents. Although predominantly associated with the sub-\nstorm recovery phase (Opgenoorth et al., 1994) omega bands\nhave also been suggested as a storm-time phenomena follow-\ning sudden impulses (Nielsen and Honary, 2000) and dur-\ning steady magnetospheric convection (e.g. Solovyev et al.,\n1999).\nA case study of periodic CNA enhancements close to\ndawn is presented from 11 May 1998; this is the first iden-\ntified observation of substorm-related omega bands in imag-\ning riometer data. This event has already been investigated\nusing magnetometer and radar data by Wild et al. (2000),\nthe combination of which provided a means of determin-\ning the associated conductance.

Coordinates are in geographic latitude and lon-\ngitude.\nCNA measurements are made and the magnitude is shown\nto be reasonably consistent with past observations during\nthis event. The transition from pulsed CNA to pole-ward\npropagating patch following the onset of a second substorm\nis shown; this is attributed to the local break-down of the\ncurrent system as a population of freshly injected electrons\ngradient-curvature drifts into the field of view of the instru-\nment.\n2 Instrumentation\nCosmic Noise Absorption data have been taken from\nthe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E) (Browne et al.,\n1995). This uses a phased array to generate 49 imaging\nbeams with widths of \u223c20 km in the D layer of the iono-\nsphere; each beam is sampled every second though in the\nfollowing study we use a minimum of 10 s averages of the\ndata. A single widebeam (\u223c100 km width) is co-located\nwith IRIS. Figure 1 shows the beam pattern of IRIS (pro-\njected at 100 km altitude) with estimates of the fields of view\n(100 km radius at 100 km altitude for raw data) of several of\nthe magnetometers used in this study. Seven of the magne-\ntometers observe substantially within the IRIS beam pattern\nallowing for direct comparisons between the data sets. These\ndata have been supplied by the International Monitor for Au-\nroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) magnetometer stations\n(Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998) and the Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Net-\nwork (SAMNET) (Davison and Orr, 1989). The resolution\nof the magnetometers can be improved (to about 50 km \u2013\nAmm et al., 2005) through application of the \u201cmagnetic field\nupward continuation\u201d procedure (Untiedt and Baumjohann,\n1993); this has not been applied to the data presented so as to\nremain consistent with past estimates of the conductance in\nthis event. In this study the perturbations have been derived\nby removing a \u201cquiet-time\u201d baseline from the magnetometer\ndata; this is calculated by identifying the quietest days (where\nlocal K < 3) around the interval of interest (one month either\nside of the event in question). From these data the most likely\nvalue in each time step is calculated via a probability density\nestimate; the resulting curve is smoothed using a Savitzky-\nGolay filter and subtracted from the data for the period in\nquestion. This is a different technique to the one employed\nby Wild et al. (2000) but the resulting magnetic perturbations\nare exceptionally similar.\nDirect observations of substorm related electron injec-\ntions and field dipolarization at geosynchronous orbit have\nbeen provided by the LANL (Los Alamos National Labo-\nratory) and GOES (Geosynchronous Operational Environ-\nmental Satellites) satellites. Particle data were taken from\nthe SOPA (Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer) instru-\nment, (LANL) in the seven energy channels spanning 50 to\n315 keV (Belian et al., 1992; Reeves et al., 1997). Magnetic\nfield measurements have been provided by twin-fluxgate\nmagnetometers on GOES-8 and GOES-9 (Singer et al.,\n1996). The inclination of the magnetic field relative to the\nGSM (Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric) equatorial plane\nhas been calculated.\n3 Observations\nOn 11 May 1998 a Ps6 pulsation was observed by the IM-\nAGE magnetometer chain between 01:30 UT and 03:30 UT\n(the magnetic local time of the magnetometers is approxi-\nmated by MLT\u2248UT+2). These data have been previously\npresented by Wild et al. (2000) but we will summarize the\nbasic observations. Five clear wavelengths with a period\n(frequency) of\u223c17 min (0.98 mHz) were observed, shown in\nFig. 2 of Wild et al. (2000); the peak to peak amplitude of the\npulsation in the Y-component maximises around 02:20 UT\n(\u223c130 nT at SOR). Calculations of the delay between AND\nand SOR suggest an eastward propagation with a mean ve-\nlocity of 750 ms\u22121. The pulsation was also visible in the line\nof sight velocity data of both the CUTLASS (Greenwald et\nal., 1995) and STARE (Greenwald et al., 1978) radars; these\nindicate that the omega band is confined between \u223c66\u25e6 and\n74\u25e6 magnetic latitude. The field of view of IRIS lies between\nmagnetic latitudes of 65.2\u25e6 and 66.8\u25e6 covering an equator-\nward portion of the ionosphere affected by the pulsation. Un-\nfortunately no optical data were available for this period.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 4183\u20134195, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4183\/2009\/\nA. J.

Geomagnetic north is\nat the top of the plot with east to the left. The number of\neach beam is labelled in the top left hand corner and those\ntraces presented in red are from beams that lie underneath\nthe estimated fields of view of the IMAGE magnetometers.\nNote that the four corner beams (1, 7, 43 and 49) have eleva-\ntion angles of \u223c21\u25e6 with very large side-lobes; consequently\nthey are less reliable than the remaining beams and should\nbe ignored. Several of the beams (20, 26, 27, 33, 34, 39\nand 40) suffer from large variations in signal strength at var-\nious points during the period; this is caused by radio stars\n(in this case Cassiopeia) appearing within the beam or a side\nlobe. Radio waves from the strong point source pass through\nirregularities in the F-layer ionosphere introducing scintilla-\ntion into the signal and masking changes due to variations in\nelectron density in the D-layer.\nThe amplitude of the pulsation is largest in the north and\nwest of the IRIS field of view, which is in the direction of\nthe magnetic pole; the amplitude is vanishingly small in the\nequatorward beams (e.g. beam 33 onwards). CNA increases\nsteadily with time except in the more equatorward beams\nwhere an abrupt increase occurs only after 03:00 UT. This\nincrease is strongest towards the equator but is visible across\nthe whole array. The keograms in Fig. 2 indicate that the post\n03:00 UT enhancement displayed both a poleward and east-\nward motion (in corrected geomagnetic coordinates). Fig-\nure 3 shows that at the poleward edge of this enhancement it\noverlaps the pulsation and the subsequent decrease in CNA\nshows that the Ps6 pulsation has ceased within the IRIS field\nof view.\nAnn.

Note the change in power\nscale at MUO and KIR.\n4 Discussion\nNielsen and Honary (2000) reported IRIS observations of a\nseries of eastward propagating CNA patches that they iden-\ntified as an omega-band-like structure. In that instance the\ncurrent-system was associated with a sudden commencement\nrather than a substorm (the authors failed to identify sub-\nstorm activity during the SC) and the authors speculated that\nthe observed phenomenon was associated with rapid trans-\nport of large amounts of energy to the dayside of the Earth.\nKawasaki and Rostoker (1979) first identified Ps6 pulsations\nin wide-beam riometer data and established a good correla-\ntion with the D-component of the magnetometer; they sug-\ngested that the CNA was caused by electrons with energy be-\ntween 5 and 20 keV with a flux of \u223c106\u2013108 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121.\nLater authors considered riometer observations when devel-\noping models of the current structure in omega bands (e.g.\nGustafsson et al., 1981; Opgenoorth et al., 1983). This paper\npresents the first observation of a substorm-related omega-\nband structure in imaging riometer data. The imaging capa-\nbility of IRIS allows for meso-scale observations of the pre-\ncipitation improving upon the point measurements available\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4183\/2009\/ Ann.

Kavanagh et al.: Observations of omega bands using an imaging riometer 4189\nthe Ps6. For the more equatorward pairings (ABK, MUO\nand KIR) there is much less power, though more from the\nmagnetometer than the riometer. Of particular note is KIR,\nwhere the left hand panel shows a clear wave signature that\ncorresponds with an increase in power around 0.98 mHz. The\nriometer signal hints at a small increase but it is not visible\nin the time series. The discrepancy is readily explained by\nthe nature of the measurements. The riometer is only sen-\nsitive to electron density enhancements directly within its\nbeam (or to a much lesser extent, its side lobes); the mag-\nnetometer has a field of view that is estimated to be about\n100 km in the E layer but in fact will detect strong signals\nfrom a significant distance away. Thus the magnetometer at\nKIR is responding to a current structure some distance to the\nnorth whereas there is little overhead electron precipitation.\nThis ably demonstrates the added value of using the imag-\ning riometer to study discrete current systems such as omega\nbands since it helps to place other observations in proper con-\ntext.\nThe extent of the current system also helps to explain the\nfailure of the wide-beam riometer to detect the Ps6 pulsation\n(Fig. 2). The wide-beam riometer at IRIS has a beam width\napproaching 90\u25e6 which encompasses all beams in the array\nexcept for the outer edge (see Fig. 1). This integrates across\nregions of the ionosphere that are not experiencing increased\nprecipitation and so leads to damping of the Ps6 signal in\nthe wide-beam data. Inspection of Fig. 3 shows that several\nof the eastward-pointing beams (20, 27, 34, 39 and 40) are\nexperiencing scintillation during the pulsation. This further\nexplains the lack of Ps6 and the increased noise in the wide-\nbeam compared to the narrow central beam.\n4.2 Magnetospheric context\nUsing the Tsyganenko-96 (T96) model we can map the iono-\nspheric footprint of the omega-band structure out into the\nmagnetosphere in order to estimate the source region of\nthe electrons that drive the omega-band structure. Figure 5\nshows the results of such a mapping for 02:00 (top), 03:00\n(middle) and 04:00 UT (bottom) with projections onto the\nGSM X-Z (left column) and X-Y (right column) planes. The\nblue traces indicate the field lines that link to the lower and\nupper latitude boundaries of the Omega-bands as determined\nfrom HF radar and magnetometer observations (Wild et al.,\n2000). It must be noted that the magnetometer is respond-\ning to the location of the Hall currents associated with the\nfield-aligned currents (FAC) within the precipitation struc-\nture and so do not exactly define the precipitation structure.\nConsequently the red trace is the estimated maximum ex-\ntent of the region of enhanced precipitation that appears after\n03:00 UT. In this case T96 has been driven using the data\nfrom the ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) satellite\nwith a simple time-lag derived from the solar wind veloc-\nity measurement. At 02:00 UT when the omega band was\napproaching its peak intensity (at SOR) the T96 model sug-\ngests that the source region for the precipitation lies between\na tail-like field-line that stretches 16RE towards the dawn\nflank and 17RE down-tail and a more dipolar field line with\napex at 8RE towards the flank The extent of the precipita-\ntion enhancement that appears after 03:00 UT is marked in\nred; according to T96 this part of the IRIS array consistently\nmaps onto field-lines between \u223c7.7 and 8.8RE .\nIt must be noted that around the time of this event a num-\nber of substorms occurred and the standard T96 model can-\nnot reproduce the dynamic behaviour of the system at these\ntimes. However, the local time of the observations (away\nfrom the main area of tail activity) and the coincidence with\npast observations give confidence in the model results.\nAlthough there was no direct observation of the omega-\nband source region we can still examine the magnetospheric\ncontext in which the associated current system formed. Wild\net al. (2000) used Greenland magnetometers to identify a\nnumber of substorm onsets around the time of the magne-\ntometer observations. In Fig. 6 we show the SOPA parti-\ncle flux data from two of the LANL satellites along with\nthe measurements of the inclination of the geomagnetic field\nfrom the GOES 8 and 9 satellites. It is immediately clear\nthat a number of electron injections and field dipolarizations\noccurred throughout the day; these are indicative of a series\nof substorms onsets that repeat with a periodicity of \u223c2.2 h.\nThis is suggestive of a Sawtooth event (e.g. Borovsky et al.,\n2001; Henderson et al., 2002; Kavanagh et al., 2007). Thus\nthe observation of traditional substorm-like characteristics\n(i.e. an omega band) in a \u201ctooth\u201d is further evidence that\nsawtooth events comprise a series of substorms. Both GOES\nsatellite are westward (duskward) of IRIS whereas the LANL\nsatellites lie eastward (dawnward) of the riometer; hence the\nelectron fluxes show a dispersed signature since the measure-\nments are made at some distance from the injection region.\nTherefore the electrons injected at the substorm onset drift\npast the riometer field-line to reach the satellites. The omega\nbands after 01:30 UT occur in the recovery phase of the sub-\nstorm with expansion onset at \u223c00:30 UT. This clearly coin-\ncides with the growth phase of the next substorm in the series\nthat occurs at\u223c02:55 UT (from the GOES data). Dispersion-\nless signature are clear in the LANL data after 03:00 UT and\nit is likely that these are linked to the large increase in CNA\nobserved by IRIS (at\u223c03:00 UT in beam 36) that propagates\nacross the field of view. The cessation of the Ps6 pulsation\nindicates that the omega-band current system breaks down\nafter \u223c03:30 UT at about the same time that the CNA starts\nto increase in the same location at the pulsation.\nUnfortunately the LANL satellites are eastward of the lo-\ncation of IRIS and no trace of the Ps6 pulsation can be found\nin the data. However it is impossible to ascertain whether\nthis is because no signature should be visible or whether it\nis simply because the omega band structure collapses before\nreaching the satellites. Inspection of the lower energy elec-\ntron from the MPA (Magnetospheric Plasma Analyser) in-\nstrument (McComas et al., 1993) also reveals no pulsation.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4183\/2009\/ Ann.

Data from the LANL and GOES satellites on the 11 May 1998. The electron flux (LANL) is provided in seven channels: 50\u201375 keV\n(blue), 75\u2013105 keV (green), 105\u2013150 keV (red), 150\u2013225 keV (cyan) and 225\u2013315 keV (magenta). The magnetic inclination is the angle of\nthe local magnetic field to the equatorial plane; the larger the value of \u03b8 the more dipole-like the field is. The series of flux enhancements\nwith dispersed energy signatures indicate periodic particle injections during substorms.\nIt is worth noting that ULF waves in the magnetosphere can\nmodulate the observed geostationary electron flux either in\na non-dispersed (e.g. field-line resonance) or a dispersed na-\nture (e.g. drift bounce resonance). If the omega band struc-\nture does persist to the longitudes of the LANL satellites\nit is not having any such affect on the electron population.\nThis suggests that the mechanism that modulates the ener-\ngetic precipitation associated with omega bands is not asso-\nciated with large scale ULF waves in the same way as for\neither field-line or drift-bounce resonance.\n4.3 Hall conductance and currents\nWild et al. (2000) used VHF and HF radars in combination\nwith magnetometer data to determine the equivalent current\nsignatures and the ionospheric Hall conductance associated\nwith the omega band. Senior et al. (2007) devised a statisti-\ncal relationship between CNA and ionospheric conductance\nbased upon IRIS data and estimates of the conductance de-\nrived from the EISCAT incoherent-scatter radar (e.g. Davies\nand Lester, 1999). Since the imaging riometer field of view\nessentially covers two of the magnetometers used in the pre-\nvious study (SOR and TRO) we can make estimates of the\nHall conductance and compare with those derived by Wild et\nal. (2000).\nFor the local time period in question (04:00\u201306:00 MLT)\nthe CNA-Hall conductance relationship is given by:\n6H = 37(CNA\u22120.14)0.45+4.3 (1)\nWhere6H is the Hall conductance in Siemens. For values of\nCNA<0.14 dB the6H is set to 4.3 S. Applying this equation\nto the IRIS data provides estimates of the conductance that\ncan be compared with those presented by Wild et al. (2000),\nwhich were based on magnetometer and radar measurements.\nIt should be noted that there can be large uncertainties associ-\nated with any statistical relationship; this can be a particular\nproblem when such a relationship, as outlined in Eq. (1), is\napplied to a case study. No statistical relationship can fully\ncapture the details of a single event; however the relation-\nship is useful for probing the omega band when considered\nalongside a different technique for determining conductance.\nWe consider the limitations of the technique within the fol-\nlowing discussion when compared with the results of Wild et\nal.

A comparison of Hall Conductance estimates. Panel (a) is\nderived from Eq. (1) for data from beam 9 (over TRO) of IRIS. Pan-\nels (b) and (c) are taken from Wild et al. (2000) and correspond to\nestimates using the TRO magnetometer with beam 9 of CUTLASS\nand beam 4 of STARE respectively. Vertical dashed lines indicate\nthe times of peak conductance according to IRIS. Peak magnitudes\nare comparable between (a) and (c) whereas the timing of peaks and\ntroughs of the Ps6 match well between (a) and (b).\nmade by Wild et al. (2000) for TRO using CUTLASS (b) and\nSTARE (c). The peak magnitudes from IRIS (20\u201330 S) are\ncloser to those derived using STARE (c) than CUTLASS (b),\nthough without the deep minima between peaks. The tim-\ning of the peaks and troughs in the conductance values better\nmatch with the estimates from the CUTLASS radar (b). The\nlatter is likely a product of the experimental arrangement of\nthe instruments; the relevant STARE beam was significantly\noff meridian and so was not orthogonal to the magnetic per-\nturbation component. This may also help explain the dis-\ncrepancy between the estimates of conductance from the two\nradars since the azimuthal velocity was significantly higher\nthat the meridional. However this does not reconcile the\ndifference in magnitude between the riometer estimate and\nthe CUTLASS radar estimate (150\u2013200 S at the peaks). As\nstated the riometer estimate is based upon the statistical re-\nlationship derived from comparisons between EISCAT data\nand IRIS (Senior et al., 2007); in that study conductance val-\nues did not reach the values stated in Wild et al. (2000) at\nany time (though the data did cover a number of substorm\nevents). The difference could be due to a general inability\nof the CNA-Hall conductance relationship to reproduce con-\nductance within an omega band. One possibility is a large\nchange in the spectrum of precipitation. Lyons and Fennell\n(1986) showed that the spectrum of precipitation during an\nomega band includes a peak in low energy (<1 keV) elec-\ntrons but that the precipitation is still dominated by the more\nenergetic electrons. This lower energy regime is more closely\nlinked to changes in the Pederson conductance as outlined in\nSenior et al. (2007), any effect on the Hall conductance due\nto this peak is likely to be small. This does not exclude the\npossibility of a specific change in the electron spectrum at\nmid-energies (e.g. 10\u201320 keV) that would enhance the Hall\nconductance with only small affect (if any) on the CNA, re-\nsulting in an under-estimation of the conductance. Senior\net al. (2008) compared different techniques for determining\nHall and Pederson conductance using optical and riometer\ndata with measurements from the EISCAT incoherent scatter\nradar during two intervals, one of which contained an omega\nband. The radar indicated Hall conductance with peak val-\nues of 60\u201380 S whereas the riometer estimates were \u223c20 S\nless (25\u201330% underestimate). It was noted that the statisti-\ncal relationship underestimated the conductance in other pe-\nriods when electron spectra derived from EISCAT measure-\nments showed peaks around 10 keV. In the current event the\nCUTLASS-magnetometer values were \u223c6\u20137 times greater\nthan the IRIS estimates in the pulsation peaks (whilst only\nslightly increased over IRIS in the troughs). It is far from\nclear that this large difference (80\u201385% difference) can be\nexplained away by increased electron flux at the lower ener-\ngies.\nIn Fig. 8 (top panel a) estimates of conductance are pro-\nvided from riometer beams that correspond to TRO and the\nother magnetometer sites, SOR, TRO, KIL and ABK. In\neach case there is an increase in Hall conductance associ-\nated with the increased electron precipitation. For the beams\nin the northern part of the array (SOR, TRO and KIL) the\nomega band structure is clear. Values for SOR follow the\nsame pattern as for TRO; comparison with the estimates\nmade by Wild et al. (2000) show similar magnitudes as for\nthe STARE-magnetometer pairing and similar timing for the\nCUTLASS-magnetometer pairing.\nPanel (b) of Fig. 8 shows the ratio of the vertical to the hor-\nizontal magnetic perturbation for each magnetometer. This\nprovides an indication of the location of the equivalent hori-\nzontal current within the omega band system. A sheet current\nin the ionosphere induces a horizontal magnetic field pertur-\nbation orthogonal to the direction of current flow detected\nby a magnetometer located on the ground under the sheet.\nVertical magnetic perturbations cancel as long as the current\ndensity is uniform within the field of view of the magnetome-\nter; if the sheet current is non-uniform, either by a reduction\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4183\/2009\/ Ann.

This is obviously the case where the Hall current\ncirculates around a region of FAC and explains the observa-\ntion that the Z component tends to peak at the location of\nFAC (e.g. Amm et al., 2005). Taking the ratio of the vertical\nand horizontal perturbations (dZ\/dX) provides an indication\nof the extent of the equivalent current system: if the mag-\nnetometer is located under a region of uniform current then\ndZ\/dX \u223c0, whereas if the magnetometer approaches the edge\nof a current system, or is under a region of reducing current\ndensity, then |dZ\/dX|> 0. Thus |dZ\/dX| can be used as an in-\ndicator of the location of a particular magnetometer relative\nto the overhead current system. When used in conjunction\nwith the estimates of conductance, provided by IRIS, it al-\nlows us to better characterise the extent of the omega band\nsystem by indicating where the currents are flowing within\nand around the precipitation features.\nFigure 8 shows that the peaks in conductance (as de-\nrived from the riometer) for SOR and TRO coincide with\nAnn.

Kavanagh et al.: Observations of omega bands using an imaging riometer 4193\nthe largest deviations in |dZ\/dX| suggesting that the horizon-\ntal sheet current is less uniform in the brightest part of the\naurora. There is a small off-set between the peaks in con-\nductance at KIL and when |dZ\/dX| tends back to zero; this\nis consistent with Hall current flowing at the flanks of the re-\ngion of most intense precipitation which contains the upward\nFAC.\nPanel (c) is a keogram of the latitudinal gradient in the\nconductance (in S km\u22121), derived from IRIS and measured\nat the longitude of the TRO magnetometer (102.9\u25e6). It is\nimmediately clear that at the latitude of TRO (the dash-dot\nline) that the peaks in conductivity occur with the largest\ndeviations from zero in |dZ\/dX| and in regions of smallest\nconductance gradient. This can also be seen in the field-of-\nview plots (i\u2013vi) in Fig. 8, which provide snapshots of the\nestimated Hall conductance in the IRIS field of view at six\ndifferent intervals (1 min averages), marked by black dashed\nlines in panels (a\u2013c). Three of the magnetometer positions\n(TRO, KIL and ABK) are marked on, SOR is located just be-\nyond the northern edge of the field of view when converted\nto geomagnetic coordinates. A cycle of a Ps6 pulsation is\nshown (ii\u2013iv), although the estimated conductance does not\ndrop much between ii and iii this is due to the increase in\nprecipitation over which the pulsation occurs. The variation\nin conductance gradient between ii and iv show clearly the\nomega band structure, with smallest gradients in the peaks\nand troughs of the pulsation in the IRIS data. The largest\nconductance gradient is located on the flanks of the conduc-\ntance where |dZ\/dX| tends to zero, suggesting that the Hall\ncurrent is tending towards uniformity (hence away from the\nregion of FAC and the edge of the current system.\nAs demonstrated by Amm et al. (2005) the omega band is\nnot strictly stationary in time; however the gradients in the\ntemporal signature identified from the magnetometer-radar\npairings are nearly analogous to the azimuthal gradients iden-\ntified by IRIS (due to the motion of the current system). The\nimages show that the precipitation in the omega band moves\nsuccessively equatorward; this can also be seen in panel (f) of\nFig. 2. This is consistent with an expanding polar cap during\na substorm growth phase. The steady deviation from zero of\nthe |dX\/dZ\/measured at ABK (and to a lesser extent at KIL)\nwould then be attributable to the equatorward motion of the\ncurrent system.\nFigure 6 shows that there was an injection of electrons and\nco-incident dipolarization of the geostationary magnetic field\nat 03:00 UT, which occurred as part of a series of injection\nevents (e.g. a sawtooth event). This is indicative of a sub-\nstorm expansion phase onset and is in agreement with the\nground measurements presented by Wild et al. (2000). As\nstated earlier the recovery phase of the preceding substorm\n(which contains the omega band) overlapped the growth\nphase of this substorm where open flux is being added to\nthe polar cap. The system breaks down at the onset of the\nnew expansion phase when the field is re-ordered and the\nomega bands are replaced by gradient-drifting electrons that\nare freshly injected into the inner magnetosphere and precip-\nitate as they drift.\n5 Conclusions\nThe precipitation boundary of a substorm-related omega-\nband has been identified in imaging riometer data for the first\ntime; this demonstrates the utility of the imaging riometer in\nthe absence of optical measurements. Past observations of\neastward-propagating absorption patches in the morning sec-\ntor display similar characteristics and so Omega-band cur-\nrent structures might explain some of the quasi-periodicity\nobserved in dawn side CNA.\nInvestigations into the ionospheric electrodynamics asso-\nciated with auroral forms such as omega bands can be en-\nhanced with the use of imaging riometers. In the absence\nof optical measurements the riometer provides a method of\nidentifying the region of electron precipitation with accuracy\nbeyond the ability of a magnetometer chain, which is mea-\nsuring the equivalent Hall currents linked to the FAC rather\nthan the precipitation itself. Due to the nature of the mea-\nsurement the narrow beams of the riometer allow for more\naccurate detection of the conductance boundaries associated\nwith omega bands than can be obtained with magnetometers,\nthough the statistical nature of the CNA-Hall conductance\nrelationship means that the absolute values may be underes-\ntimated. The combination of riometer and optical measure-\nments would improve the conductance estimates (e.g. Senior\net al., 2008).\nThrough the use of a statistical relationship between cos-\nmic noise absorption and hall conductance the imaging ri-\nometer provides maps of conductance and estimates of the\nspatial gradients in the field of view. Although only a statis-\ntical estimate the derived values agree reasonably well with\nthe calculations based upon magnetometer and VHF radar\ndata for the same event, but disagree strongly with estimates\nusing HF radars. It is not clear why such a large discrepancy\noccurs for the interval presented in this paper, but it may be\ndue to strong enhancements of the electron flux at energies\naround 10 keV to which the riometer is less sensitive, whilst\nthe smaller values associated with the VHF radar may be due\nto the experimental arrangement of the instruments.\nThe omega band current system of 11 May 1998 occurred\nduring one of the \u201cteeth\u201d of a sawtooth event, providing fur-\nther evidence that these comprise a series of substorms. The\ncurrent system in question occurred in the recovery phase\nof one substorm, which overlapped the growth phase of the\nnext, disappearing with the expansion phase onset to be re-\nplaced by a gradient-curvature drifting electron population\nwith more diffuse precipitation.\nAcknowledgements.
