Introduction\nThe Southern Ocean is a place of both strong eddy\nactivity and strong mean flows. One might expect vig-\norous eddies to be efficient at mixing tracers. However,\nstrong jets can inhibit transport across their axes. In fact,\nspatially inhomogeneous mixing and the jet-formation\nmechanism appear to be fundamentally linked through\npotential vorticity (PV) dynamics (Haynes et al. 2007;\nDritschel and McIntyre 2008). Furthermore, baroclinic\ncurrents can have different transport properties at dif-\nferent vertical levels. These vertical variations in eddy\nmixing in the troposphere and stratosphere have been\ninvestigated by Haynes and Shuckburgh (2000a,b), and\nalso recently in more idealized models of baroclinic jets\nby, for instance, Greenslade and Haynes (2008; see also\nEsler 2008a,b). In an ocean context, Bower et al. (1985)\nsuggested the Gulf Stream acts as a transport barrier\nnear the surface but mixes strongly across the front\nat depth. This observation was followed by numerous\nLagrangian studies that confirmed the general picture\n(Bower and Rossby 1989; Bower 1991; Rogerson et al.\n1999; Yuan et al. 2002). Here we investigate the meridi-\nonal and vertical variations of mesoscale eddy mixing in\nthe Southern Ocean using a tracer-based approach.\nOur work builds on the paper of Marshall et al. (2006,\nhereafter MSJH), who drove an advection\u2013diffusion\nmodel with surface velocities computed from satellite\naltimetry. In their study, an initial tracer distribution with\na prescribed monotonic gradient across the Antarctic\nCircumpolar Current (ACC) was stirred and mixed by\nthe two-dimensional eddying flow. The theoretical frame-\nwork set out by Nakamura (1996) was then applied to the\ntracer distribution. The resulting \u2018\u2018effective diffusivity,\u2019\u2019\nCorresponding author address: Ryan Abernathey, Department\nof Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts In-\nstitute of Technology, Room 54-1421, 77 Massachusetts Avenue,\nCambridge, MA 02139.\nE-mail: rpa@mit.edu\n170 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nDOI: 10.1175\/2009JPO4201.1\n\u0002 2010 American Meteorological Society\nKeff, characterizes the rate of mixing by eddies acting lat-\nerally at the sea surface. An interesting meridional struc-\nture emerged, with enhancedmixing rates (;2000 m2 s21)\non the equatorial flank and evidence of suppressed\nmixing (;500 m2 s21) near the core of the ACC. This\nresult was consistent with the notion that the mean flow\nwas acting to suppress mixing.\nSmith and Marshall (2009, hereafter SM), echoing\nearlier work by Treguier (1999), suggested that although\nKeff is small in the core of the ACC at the sea surface, it\nmight be expected to be enhanced near the steering level\nof baroclinic waves growing on the thermal wind shear\nof the ACC. Employing a linear quasigeostrophic sta-\nbility analysis of a hydrographic climatology of the\nSouthern Ocean, SM showed that the steering level of\nthe fastest-growing unstable modes resides at a depth of\norder 1.5 km and is roughly coincident with the level at\nwhich the meridional quasigeostrophic potential vor-\nticity (QGPV) gradient changes sign. Linear theory\n(Green 1970;Marshall 1981; Killworth 1997) suggests that\nthe eddy diffusivity of a growing baroclinic wave has\na maximum at the steering level. Moreover, in calcula-\ntions with a nonlinear stackedQGmodel, SM confirmed\nthat this linear result survives in the nonlinear regime.\nThey also presented observational evidence that the\nphase of surface altimetric signals, the surface signature\nof interior baroclinic instability, propagates downstream\nat roughly 2 cm s21, the speed of the mean current at\na depth of 1.5 km or so, and much slower than the\n10 cm s21 mean surface current.\nHere our goal is to map the meridional and depth\nstructure of Keff in the Southern Ocean using the ef-\nfective diffusivity methodology set out by Nakamura\n(1996). In the absence of observed three-dimensional\nvelocity fields, we make use of an eddying numerical\nstate estimate of the SouthernOcean tightly constrained\nby observations, and we diagnose Keff from the tracer\ndistribution on isopycnal surfaces. The resulting effec-\ntive diffusivity cross sections support the notion of in-\ntensified mixing at depth and also reveal that deep\nmixing below the ACC connects with the heightened\nsurface mixing found by MSJH on the equatorward\nflank. The structure of Keff contains the signature of\na critical layer, wherein the interplay between upstream-\npropagating waves and eastward mean flow determines\nwhere mixing is enhanced and suppressed.\nOur paper is organized in the following way: section 2\ncontains a description of the state estimate and the\nmachinery used to calculate effective diffusivity. The\nresults of the calculation and a discussion of the mixing\npatterns observed, along with some regional calcula-\ntions, compose section 3. In section 4, we discuss the\nrelationship between the effective diffusivity and the\nmean potential vorticity field. We also use Keff in con-\njunction with the potential vorticity field to infer the\neddy-driven transport in the ACC region. A discussion\nof our findings and conclusions are given in section 5.\n2. Numerical simulation of tracer transport\na. Southern Ocean state estimate\nThis study takes advantage of a new, high-resolution\nEstimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean\n(ECCO) product (http:\/\/www.ecco-group.org) called the\nSouthern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE; Mazloff 2008).\nOceanic state estimation (described, e.g., by Wunsch\nand Heimbach 2007) rigorously synthesizes diverse ob-\nservations in a dynamically consistent manner. This is\naccomplished through minimization of the misfit be-\ntween the observations and a numerical model, in this\ncase the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general\ncirculation model (MITgcm; Marshall et al. 1997). The\nobservations used to constrain SOSE include Argo\nsubsurface floats, satellite measurements of sea surface\ntemperature and sea surface height, Gravity Recovery\nand Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, in\nsitu data from CTD and XBT casts, and National Cen-\nters for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis\natmospheric data. The model has a resolution of 1\/68,\npermitting mesoscale eddies to form, and spans a 2-yr\nperiod from 2005 through 2006. During this time period,\nSOSE is found to be more consistent with the data than\noptimally interpolated global climatological data prod-\nucts such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration\u2019s (NOAA)World OceanAtlas (Stephens\net al. 2001; Gourestski and Koltermann 2004). We use\nthe velocity fields from SOSE to model the evolution\nof a passive numerical tracer. We also use the mean hy-\ndrographic fields to describe the climatological state of\nthe Southern Ocean and to compute potential vorticity.\nA snapshot of the surface velocity field, revealing SOSE\u2019s\nrich mesoscale structure, is shown in Fig. 1a.\nb. Tracer advection\nWe characterize the eddy mixing by studying the evo-\nlution of a tracer governed by an advection\u2013diffusion\nequation. The eddies stir the tracer, lengthening its\ncontours and thereby enhancing the effect of small-scale\ndiffusion. Nakamura (1996) developed a method to quan-\ntify this process by formulating the tracer equation in\nterms of a quasi-Lagrangian tracer-area coordinate, in\nwhich all transport is diffusive, making it possible to\ndiagnose an effective eddy diffusivity using only a snap-\nshot of the tracer field. Here we use the form given by\nMSJH, in which the effective diffusivity is written as\nJANUARY 2010 ABERNATHEY ET AL . 171\nK\neff\n5 k\nL2eq\nL2min\n, (1)\nwhere k represents the small-scale diffusion that halts\nthe cascade of tracer variance, Lmin represents the length\nof an unstrained contour, andLeq, the equivalent length,\ncan be thought of as the length of the stretched contour.\nThis equivalent length can be computed from an in-\nstantaneous snapshot of the tracer field as\nL2eq5\n\u203a\n\u203aA\n\u00f0\nj=2qj dA\n\u203aq\n\u203aA\n\u0002 \u00032 . (2)\nWe have included this expression for completeness, but\nwe refer the reader to the appendix of MSJH for its\nderivation.\nThe effective diffusivity formalism is rigorously defined\nfor advection\u2013diffusion of a tracer in two dimensions.\nHowever, we wish to obtain information about the ver-\ntical and meridional distribution of Keff. We therefore\nfirst employ the SOSEeddying velocity fields v5 (u, y,w)\nto advect a passive tracerq according to the 3Dadvection\u2013\ndiffusion equation,\n\u203aq\n\u203at\n1 v \u0002 $q5 k\nh\n=2hq1 ky\n\u203a2q\n\u203az2\n, (3)\nwhere kh and ky are the horizontal and vertical diffusion\ncoefficients and =h\n2 is the horizontal Laplacian. In a\nsecond step, the tracer field is then mapped onto two-\ndimensional neutral surfaces in the interior and Keff\nevaluated from (1) using an appropriate choice of kh, as\ndescribed below.\nFollowing MSJH, we chose an initial tracer distribu-\ntion approximately aligned with the streamlines of the\nACC. As in Karsten andMarshall (2002), a single stream-\nline of the time-mean vertically integrated\u2013transport\nstreamfunction was chosen from the core of the ACC.\nThis was used as a reference to initialize tracer concen-\ntrations ranging from 0 to 1 along lines running parallel to\nthis reference contour, as shown in Fig. 1b. The same\ninitial concentration was used on each vertical level. This\nchoice leads to a rapid equilibration of the Leq tracer\ncontours, but any initial tracer gradient roughly perpen-\ndicular to the ACC would result in a reliable calculation.\n(This was confirmed by repeating our calculations with\nthe initial tracer contours simply aligned with latitude\ncircles; the resulting Leq was not significantly different\nfrom the results presented here.) We also employ the\ncontours of this initial tracer field to define an approxi-\nmate \u2018\u2018streamwise average.\u2019\u2019\nWe performed the tracer advection on the same nu-\nmerical grid as the original SOSE model, using the off-\nline capability of the MITgcm. With grid points every\none-sixth of a degree, the maximum grid spacing was\nFIG. 1. (a) Snapshot of surface current speed from SOSE. The color scale ranges from 0 to 0.5 m s21.

The black contours show the initial tracer\ndistribution, which was also used to define a meridional coordinate for pseudostreamwise averaging. The six sectors\nhighlighted indicate the different regions for the regional effective diffusivity calculations.\n172 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\napproximately 18 km. Several experiments were carried\nout in which kh was set to, respectively, 50, 100, 200, and\n400 m2 s21. In all cases the vertical diffusion is set to\nky 5 13 10\n25 m2 s21, roughly consistent with observed\ndiapycnal mixing rates in the thermocline.\nThe role of diffusive processes inherent in the nu-\nmerical implementation, togetherwith the overall impact\nof horizontal versus vertical diffusion, can be assessed\nby considering the globally averaged tracer variance\nequation,\n1\n2\n\u203ahq2i\n\u203at\n5\u0003k(num)h hj$hqj2i \u0003 k(num)y hq2zi, (4)\nwhere h i indicates a volume-weighted average over the\nwhole domain. Here, k\n(num)\nh and k\n(num)\ny represent the\ndiffusivities required to bring the observed decay in q2 to\nconsistency with the above variance equation. For all\nvalues of kh in our experiments, the vertical term was\nat least an order of magnitude smaller than the hori-\nzontal, indicating that horizontal diffusion, rather than\nvertical, is responsible for dissipating tracer variance at\nsmall scales. More detailed analysis of the variance equa-\ntion indicates that, for values of kh below 200 m\n2 s21,\nimplicit numerical diffusion augments the explicit value\nof kh by up to 60%, a finding consistent with incomplete\nresolution of the Batchelor scale. In particular, using\nkh 5 50 m\n2 s21 gave k\n(num)\nh 5 83 m\n2 s21 while kh 5\n100 m2 s21 gave k\n(num)\nh 5 128 m\n2 s21. In these cases, we\nuse the estimated numerical value of kh in calculating\nKeff. Higher values of kh did not generate significant\nspurious diffusion.\nBefore calculating Keff, we allowed the tracer to\nevolve for one year. A sample tracer field after one year\nof stirring using kh 5 50 m\n2 s21 is shown in Fig. 1b. Vi-\nsual inspection reveals plausible tracer patterns and no\nevidence of gridscale aliasing, despite the rather low\nvalue of diffusivity employed. Such levels of explicit\ndiffusivity were also found to be appropriate in the study\nof MSJH, where altimetric fields were used to drive the\ntracer evolution rather than, as here, model fields con-\nstrained by observations.\nc. Isopycnal projection\nThe effect of mesoscale eddies acting in the \u2018\u2018surface\ndiabatic layer,\u2019\u2019 where isopycnals outcrop, differs fun-\ndamentally from their role in the adiabatic interior of\nthe ocean (Held and Schneider 1999; Kuo et al. 2005). In\nthe surface layer, eddies transport buoyancy horizon-\ntally across isopycnals. In the interior, eddies stir pri-\nmarily along tilted neutral surfaces, mixing potential\nvorticity and other tracers isopycnally. Here we attempt\nto characterize these two regions separately, diagnosing\na horizontal Keff near the sea surface and an isopycnal\nK\n(i)\neff in the interior.\nAn individual effective diffusivity calculation requires a\ntwo-dimensional tracerfield: a slice takenat constantdepth\nforKeff, or a slice at constant neutral density forK\n(i)\neff . Cross\nsections can be built by stacking the results from many\nsuch slices, as described for example in Nakamura and\nMa (1997) and Haynes and Shuckburgh (2000a), who\nused isentropic surfaces in the atmosphere, or Cerovecki\net al. (2009), who employed the same neutral-surface-\nprojection technique described here. Constant-depth\ntracer fields for computingKeff are trivial to extract from\nthe model output, since it uses depth coordinates intrin-\nsically. The neutral-surface projection for K\n(i)\neff requires\nmore care. We first calculated neutral density gn from\nthe instantaneous SOSE temperature and salinity fields\nusing the algorithm of Jackett andMcDougall (1997).We\nchose 35 discrete values of gn to define a new density-\nbased vertical coordinate. The tracer profile at each point\nwas then interpolated onto these values of gn and the\nresulting two-dimensional tracer surfaces analyzed to\ndetermine K\n(i)\neff as described in the next section.\n3. Cross sections of effective diffusivity in the\nmeridional plane\nBoth the theoretical framework for deriving Keff in\nterms of the modified-Lagrangian-mean tracer equation\nand the numerical technique for its computation are well\ndocumented (Nakamura 1996; Nakamura and Ma 1997;\nShuckburgh and Haynes 2003; MSJH) and so are not\nrepeated here. We calculated L2eq as defined in (2) using\naMATLAB code;L2eq was calculated on both horizontal\nand isopycnal tracer surfaces from simulations using kh\nvalues of 50, 100, 200, and 400 m2 s21, yielding a total of\neight cross sections. To calculate L2min, the minimum\npossible length of a tracer contour was inferred by per-\nforming an experiment using kh 5 4 3 10\n4 m2 s21. This\nvery large value of diffusivity decreases the Pe\u00b4clet num-\nber to the extent that explicit diffusion rather than ad-\nvection dominates the tracer evolution. MSJH showed\nthat in this regime, the resulting contour lengths, again\ncalculated from (2), tend toLmin. Using (1),Keff was then\ncomputed. As described earlier, the level of mixing ex-\nperienced by the numerical tracer, k\n(num)\nh , was diagnosed\nfrom the tracer variance equation.A cutoffminimumwas\nimposed on Lmin of 10 000 km, chosen to prevent small\nvalues of Lmin (caused by the surface outcropping of\nisopycnals or by the intersection of topography) from\nunrealistically inflating Keff.\nBoth Leq and Lmin are defined as functions of the area\nA enclosed by a tracer contour.Amapping exists between\nA and an equivalent latitude fe. In the atmosphere, in the\nJANUARY 2010 ABERNATHEY ET AL . 173\nabsence of topography, this mapping simply identifies the\nlatitude circle that encloses the given area. But here we\nmust account for basin geometry as well as isopycnal\noutcrops. We can define the area enclosed by a latitude\ncircle fe on a neutral surface g\nn as\nA\ngn\n(f\ne\n)5\n\u00f0 \u00f0f\ne\n908S\ng(l, f) dA, (5)\nwhere g(l, f) 5 0 for all locations not in the water (i.e.,\ninside topography or beyond isopycnal outcrops) and\ng 5 1 otherwise. We evaluated this expression numeri-\ncally in the SOSE domain and used it to map Leq and\nLmin to positions in latitude.\na. Global cross section\nThe results of our calculations for different values of\nkh are shown as meridional cross sections in Fig. 2. (The\nisopycnal calculations were mapped back to depth co-\nordinates using the average depth of the neutral surfaces\nat each latitude.) The horizontal and isopycnal diffu-\nsivities share certain characteristics. Each panel in Fig. 2\nindicates a region of intense mixing deep beneath the\nACC (centered around 548S) that becomes shallower\nmoving equatorward. The greatest differences between\nthem occur, unsurprisingly, near the surface. The hori-\nzontal diffusivities tend to intensify near the surface, at\nleast equatorward of theACC region, while the isopycnal\ndiffusivities uniformly decrease at depths shallower than\n200 m because the sea surface acts to suppress isopycnal\nstirring on tilted neutral surfaces. The high horizontal\neffective diffusivities close to the bottom are not the re-\nsult of enhanced stirring increasing Leq, but rather result\nfrom the intrusion of topography, which causes small\nvalues ofLmin to inflateKeff. The isopycnal projections do\nFIG. 2. Comparison of different effective diffusivity calculations. The \u2018\u2018horizontal\u2019\u2019 diffu-\nsivities were computed on surfaces of constant height and the isopycnal diffusivities on surfaces\nof constant neutral density. The same color scale, in m2 s21, is used for each value of kh in-\ndicated on the right. Note that the color scaling changes significantly for kh 5 400 m\n2 s21.\n174 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\nnot suffer from this problem, and these will be our pri-\nmary focus.\nFrom Fig. 2, we see that increasing the value of kh\nblurs the structure of Keff somewhat. Indeed, visual in-\nspection of the tracer fields reveals that (not surprisingly)\nthey become increasingly smooth and less complex as\nkh is increased. Figure 3 plots horizontal Keff at the base\nof the mixed layer for various choices of kh, along with\nthe Keff profile obtained by MSJH directly using altim-\netry. We clearly see that the distributions of Keff ob-\ntained here using kh 5 50 and 100 m\n2 s21 are very close\nto those of MSJH, while those obtained using larger\nvalues of kh are considerably greater inmagnitude. Since\neither of the lower values produces a result consistent\nwith the earlier study, we choose to analyze the kh 5\n100 m2 s21 case, because the numerical diffusion (k\n(num)\nh ,\ndiagnosed in the previous section) is smaller in pro-\nportion to the explicit diffusion. This choice is also sup-\nported on consideration of the (Pe, Nu) plot presented in\nMSJH, where Pe is the Pe\u00b4clet number andNu5Keff\/kh is\nthe Nusselt number. For sufficiently large Pe (i.e., suffi-\nciently small kh), the slope of the line in (Pe, Nu) space is\norder unity, in which case Keff becomes independent of\nthe small-scale value of kh (MSJH; Shuckburgh and\nHaynes 2003). This decreasing sensitivity can be clearly\nseen in Fig. 2 as kh is reduced.\nSince Keff, the horizontal diffusivity, applies more\nreadily to eddy buoyancy fluxes in the surface diabatic\nlayer, while K\n(i)\neff is more appropriate for isopycnal mix-\ning in the interior, in Fig. 4 we present a composite of\nthese two quantities. We have chosen to separate the\nregions at 100-m depth, a typical mixed layer depth\n(MLD) for this region.1 Contours of the streamwise-\naveraged zonal velocity are also shown in Fig. 4, in-\ndicating the mean position of the ACC. Although the\ntime and spatial average blurs the fine structure and\nmultiple jets of the current, a strong mean flow is still\napparent. A striking feature is that in both the surface\nlayer and the interior, effective diffusivity is significantly\nreduced where the mean flow is strongest. Mixing is\nenhanced between the 2 and 4 cm s21 contours, partic-\nularly on the equatorward side of the jet: the surface of\nmaximumKeff is at a depth of order 1500 m beneath the\ncore of the ACC and shoals on the equatorial flank.\nSM anticipated this general form for Keff, drawing on\ninsights from linear baroclinic instability theory. In the\nanalysis of a growing baroclinic disturbance (see, e.g.,\nGreen 1970;Marshall 1981;Killworth 1997), the diffusivity\nof quasigeostrophic potential vorticity takes the form\nK\nq\n5\nc\ni\nk\n(\u00bd)y92\n(U \u0003 c\nr\n)2\n, (6)\nwhere U is the mean zonal current, cr is the real part of\nthe phase speed, ci is the imaginary part (the growth\nrate), k is the zonal wavenumber, and (\u00bd)y92 is the eddy\nkinetic energy. At finite amplitude, the general de-\npendence of the diffusivity on the eddy kinetic energy,\nthe phase speed, and the mean flow can be expected to\nhold, since the form of the diffusivity is related to the\nkinematics of particle displacement. SM noted that the\nobserved zonal propagation speed of altimetric signals\nin the ACC was roughly 2 cm s21, significantly smaller\nthan mean surface zonal currents, typically 10 cm s21\n(e.g., shown in Fig. 4). At depth, however, where mean\nflow advection and wave propagation speeds are much\nmore closely in sync, the wave can \u2018\u2018keep up\u2019\u2019 with the\nmean flow and achieve large meridional excursions of\nfluid parcels, promoting mixing. SM followed up these\nlinear arguments with detailed, fully turbulent calcula-\ntions using a stacked quasi-geostrophic model, which\nwas relaxed back to observed hydrography on the large\nscale. They confirmed that intensified mixing of poten-\ntial vorticity occurred at depth, near the steering level\npredicted by linear theory where U 5 c. The depth\nwhere U 5 c is also frequently referred to as a \u2018\u2018critical\nlevel\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018critical layer\u2019\u2019 (Bretherton 1966; Boss and\nFIG. 3. Comparison of effective diffusivity values with those\nfound byMSJH. The markers show horizontalKeff at 100-m depth,\nroughly at the base of the mixed layer, from our experiments with\nkh5 400, 200, 100, and 50 m\n2 s21. The solid line isKeff fromMSJH.\n1 The mixed layer depth provides a reasonable estimate of the\nactual depth of the surface diabatic layer, since mixed layer waters\nare subject to convection and thereby exposed to diabatic forcing\nnear the surface. Dong et al. (2008) recently performed a detailed\ndiagnosis of theMLD in the SouthernOcean fromArgo data. They\nfound substantial spatial and seasonalMLDvariability, withMLDs\nreaching over 400 m in the winter just north of the Subantarctic\nFront.\nJANUARY 2010 ABERNATHEY ET AL . 175\nThompson 1999). The findings reported here, which\nmake use of a much more realistic eddying model con-\nstrained to be close to observations, support the idea\nthat critical-layer enhancement occurs in the region of\nthe ACC. The numerical studies of Treguier (1999) and\nCerovecki et al. (2009) also provide clear evidence of\nintensified mixing in the critical layer of a baroclinically\nunstable jet. Treguier (1999) in particular diagnoses\nmixing coefficients based on flux\u2013gradient inversions of\nboth quasigeostrophic potential vorticity in the hori-\nzontal and Ertel potential vorticity along isopycnals.\nThe resulting vertical diffusivity profile (her Fig. 9) is\nremarkably similar to our vertical profile of K\n(i)\neff in the\njet axis, reaching a peak of 1600 m2 s21 at 1500-m depth.\nIf steering-level effects are responsible for the en-\nhanced diffusivity at depth, we might expect to observe\neddies propagating eastward at a speed slower than the\nsurface mean flow in SOSE. The phase speeds can be\ncalculated using Radon transforms, as done in SM, but\nhere we opt for the simpler approach of constructing\nHovmo\u00a8ller diagrams. We examined the SOSE sea sur-\nface height anomaly in a sector in the Pacific between\n1658 and 1358W. Figure 5 shows two Hovmo\u00a8ller dia-\ngrams, one at 538S, near the mean zonal flow maximum\nin this region, and one at 478S. It is encouraging to see\nthat c \u2019 2 cm s21 in the ACC, since this places the\nsteering level around 2000 m deep, in agreement with\nthe structure ofKeff in Fig. 4. North of the jet at 478S, the\nanomalies propagatewestward at approximately 1 cm s21.\nThese numbers are in agreement with those of SM.\nb. Regional cross sections\nWhile the global cross section of effective diffusiv-\nity seems to offer a picture consistent with the global\nstreamwise-average mean fields, the Southern Ocean\ncontains large zonal asymmetries in bathymetry, circu-\nlation, and eddy activity. To address the zonal variations\nin mixing, we split the domain into six sectors and re-\npeated the calculation on each sector. Shuckburgh et al.\n(2009b) have shown how this procedure, while not for-\nmally permitted in Nakamura\u2019s construction, still gives\nmeaningful values of Keff in the truncated domain. The\ncross sections of the isopycnal diffusivity K\n(i)\neff are shown\nin Fig. 6, along with zonally averaged zonal velocity and\nisopycnals. Again, we imposed a minimum on Lmin, re-\nquiringLmin. 2200 km in each sector. WhereLmin does\nnot meet this criterion, no value is plotted in Fig. 6,\nleading to the irregular white patches near the surface\nand bottom. Outcropping isopycnals or the intersection\nof neutral surfaces with bottom topography can lead to\nvery small values of Lmin, but this effect does not truly\nreflect an enhanced effective diffusivity. The cutoff pro-\ncedure focuses attention on variations inKeff due to varia-\ntion in Leq.\nIntensified mixing at depth is clearly present on the\nflanks of the jet maxima in most sectors, the location in\nlatitude varying with the local flow. Other regions of en-\nhanced mixing in each sector can also be related to the\nlocal current system. In particular, as noted by Shuckburgh\net al. (2009b), strong mixing is found in regions where\nFIG. 4. Effective diffusivityKeff inm\n2 s21. (top)Horizontal effective diffusivity in the upper\n100 m.

The velocity contour interval is 2 cm s21.\n176 JOURNAL OF PHYS ICAL OCEANOGRAPHY VOLUME 40\neddies are generated in association with topographic\nfeatures in regions of weak zonal mean flow. In Fig. 6a,\nof the region south of Africa between the Atlantic and\nPacific, the mixing in the ACC is concentrated in a nar-\nrow region below and equatorward of the jet. Another\nsurface-intensified mixing region appears north of 408S.\nMovies of the tracer evolution suggest that this mixing is\nassociated with the intense eddies of the Agulhas rings.\nThe Indian Ocean sector, Fig. 6b, shows very strong\nmixing on both sides of the jet as well as below. This\nsector contains the Kerguelen Plateau, a large topo-\ngraphic feature that generates strong eddy activity as the\nflow passes over and around it. South of Australia (Fig.\n6c), the only strong mixing occurs in a deep, narrow\nband between 1000- and 2000-m depth. Figure 6d is the\nsouthwest Pacific, the region in which the Hovmo\u00a8ller\ndiagrams of Fig. 5 were constructed. In agreement with\nour steering-level hypothesis, enhanced mixing at depth\nis observed at around 538S below the jet where the zonal\nvelocity is 2 cm s21. This sector also shows the clearest\nmultiple-jet structure, both in the mean flow field and in\nthe bands of high and low Keff. In Fig. 6e, the southeast\nPacific, Keff seems quite weak, consistent with the low\neddy kinetic energy in this region and with the results of\nShuckburgh et al. (2009b). However, it still shows in-\ntensification with depth. Finally, downstream of Drake\nPassage (Fig. 6f), intense mixing appears very wide-\nspread. It is likely that much of the mixing north of 458S\nis the result of eddies spawned by the Falkland Current.\nIn general, the regional plots suggest that much of the\nstrong mixing visible in Fig. 4 north of 458S, where the\nmean flow is very weak, is the result of interaction with\nthe continents rather than frontal dynamics.\nThe Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in\nthe Southern Ocean (DIMES; Gille et al. 2007) is on-\ngoing (2009\u201312). The goal of the experiment is to mea-\nsure mixing rates in the region upstream of the Drake\nPassage using RAFOS floats and a patch of chemical\ntracer. Our results predict that isopycnal mixing rates\nvary considerably with latitude and depth. To gain some\ninsight into the locations of intensified mixing in the\nDIMES region, we canmap the effective diffusivity back\nonto tracer contours from the tracer snapshot used in the\nKeff calculation, sinceKeff5Keff(A)5Keff(q). We have\nconstructed such maps on the two DIMES target iso-\npycnals, gn5 27.2 and gn5 27.9, and near the surface, in\nFig. 7. (These isopycnals are also highlighted in Fig. 6e,\nthe sector containing the DIMES region.) Satellite al-\ntimetric data are available to the DIMES investigators\nin real time during the deployment of floats and tracers.\nWith this in mind, we have included contours of the in-\nstantaneous sea surface height from SOSE in Fig. 7,\nwhich suggest the position of the ACC fronts. This pre-\nsentation highlights the fact that isopycnal mixing on the\ndeeper surface is strongest directly at the front, while on\nthe shallower surface themixing is weak right at the front,\nbut stronger to the north.\n4. Potential vorticity mixing\nThe meridional overturning circulation cannot be mea-\nsured directly and must be inferred. One approach in the\nSouthern Ocean, where eddies are suspected to contrib-\nute significantly to the meridional transport, has been to\ndeduce the eddy mass transport by assuming the down-\ngradient transfer of potential vorticity by eddies. For\ninstance, Marshall et al. (1993), Speer et al. (2000), and\nKarsten and Marshall (2002) have all employed some\nversion of this technique. To use this approach, a diffu-\nsion coefficient of PV must be specified; in many cases,\nthis coefficient is assumed to be constant.We have found,\nhowever, that isopycnal mixing is highly nonuniform in\nFIG. 5. Hovmo\u00a8ller diagrams of SOSE sea surface height anomaly (cm) in the Pacific. (a) At\n538S, a latitude where the ACC is strong in this sector, the anomalies appear to propagate east,\ndownstream. The dotted black line denotes an eastward phase speed of 2 cm s21. (b) At 478S,\nnorth of theACC, the anomalies propagate west, as expected of Rossbywaves in the absence of\na strong mean zonal flow. The dotted line here indicates a westward phase speed of 1 cm s21.\nNote that the anomalies in the northern region are much weaker than those in the ACC, and\nconsequently, variability on short time scales is visible in (b) that is not noticeable in (a) due to\nthe difference in color scales.\nJANUARY 2010 ABERNATHEY ET AL . 177\nspace. In this section we explore some of the conse-\nquences of spatial variations in effective diffusivity.\nNote that we do not attempt to directly diagnose the\neddy PV flux or flux\u2013gradient relationships from SOSE\nbecause the computation of stable eddy statistics de-\nmands long time series (only two years are available\nfrom SOSE) and because the local fluxes are dominated\nby rotational components (Marshall and Shutts 1981).\na. The potential vorticity field\nWe diagnosed the potential vorticity distribution us-\ning the time-mean SOSE fields. The following form is\ncomputed appropriate to the large scale:\nP5 f\n\u203ab\n\u203az\n, (7)\nwhere b is the buoyancy and f the Coriolis parameter.\nThe relative vorticity has been neglected because the\nRossby number is small on the large scales. Using the\nsame isopycnal transformation described in section 2,\nwe computed P and took its streamwise average in\nbuoyancy space (i.e., following streamlines and iso-\npycnals). The result is plotted, transformed back to\ndepth coordinates, in Fig. 8a. We see that surfaces of\nconstant b and surfaces of constant P align with one\nanother over much of the domain, especially for iso-\npycnals that do not outcrop. This is confirmed by the plot\nof the isopycnal gradient of P shown in Fig. 8b, which is\nsmall in much of the interior. Notably, PV gradients be-\ncome very large near the surface in the southern ACC\nregion, just where we observe reduced effective diffu-\nsivities. To examine thismore closely, in Fig. 9 we plot the\nPV gradient along with K\n(i)\neff on several different iso-\npycnals. We do indeed find consistently low values ofK\n(i)\neff\nwhere PV gradients are low. The PV gradients are high\nin the core of the jet, consistent with the invertibility\nFIG. 6.

But there does appear to\nbe a transition zone, where both (\u203aP\/\u203ay)b and Keff are\nnonzero. This suggests a nonzero eddy flux of PV.\nb. Parameterized eddy forcing\nWe consider the streamwise- and time-averagemomen-\ntum balance of the large-scale flow through the trans-\nformedEulerianmean (TEM) zonalmomentum equation\n(see, e.g., Andrews et al. 1987; Ferreira et al. 2005):\n\u0003f y\nres\n5\u0003 1\nr\n0\n\u203ap\n\u203ax\n1 y9q91\n1\nr\n0\n\u203atwx\n\u203az\n, (8)\nwhere yres is the residualmeridional velocity, a sumof eddy\nand mean contributions, y9q9 is the zonal- or streamwise-\naverage meridional eddy QGPV flux, and tx\nw is the wind\nstress. It is common to define an \u2018\u2018eddy velocity\u2019\u2019 y* as the\nageostrophic part explicitly balanced by the PV flux:\n\u0003f y*5 y9q9. (9)\nThe quantity y* is often referred to as the bolus velocity,\nand is also related to the \u2018\u2018gyroscopic pump\u2019\u2019 described\nby Dritschel and McIntyre (2008).\nFollowing, for example, Green (1970), Rhines and\nYoung (1982), Killworth (1997), Visbeck et al. (1997),\nand Treguier et al. (1997), etc., we assume y9q9 is trans-\nferred down the mean gradient q\ny\nwith our isopycnal\neffective diffusivity, thus\ny9q95\u0003K(i)eff\n\u203aq\n\u203ay\n. (10)\nNote that the isopycnal effective diffusivity is used in\nEq. (10) and is worthy of comment. As shown by Plumb\nand Ferarri (2005), in the limit that relative vorticity can\nbe neglected, the residual meridional isentropic eddy\nflux of Ertel PV is proportional to the horizontal me-\nridional eddy flux of QGPV. Indeed we note in passing\nthat, under quasigeostrophic scaling, the meridional gra-\ndient of QGPV at constant z is equal to the meridional\ngradient of Ertel potential vorticity P along isopycnals,\nthat is,\n\u203aq\n\u203ay\n\u0002 \u0003\nz\n\u2019 1\nN2\n\u203aP\n\u203ay\n\u0002 \u0003\nb\n.

Since our isopycnal effective diffusivities most\nclosely describe the transport of a conserved tracer (like\nErtel PV) along isopycnals, K\n(i)\neff is the more appropriate\nchoice to capture the horizontal eddy mixing of QGPV.\nThe mean QGPV gradient was computed at each lat-\nitude.

This circulation is con-\nsistent with the effort by the eddies to flatten the sloping\nisopycnals, releasing potential energy. Below 1000-m\ndepth, where the PV gradients are weaker and Keff is\nrelatively high, the two methods of estimating y* yield\nvery similar estimates. But at shallower depths, the\nconstant-K parameterization produces a much greater\nestimate of the southward eddy transport in the density\nclasses corresponding to upper-circumpolar deep water\n(27.5 , gn , 28.0). From this we conclude that one\npotential consequence of the diminished mixing in the\njet core is the suppression of the eddy component of the\nmeridional overturning circulation.\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nThis study has used a tracer-based approach, to-\ngether with a model of the Southern Ocean constrained\nby observations, to quantify mesoscale eddy stirring in\nthe Southern Ocean. The foremost result we wish to\nhighlight is the presence of enhanced eddy effective\ndiffusivity well below 1000-m depth in the Southern\nOcean. Overall, a structure is observed of reduced eddy\ndiffusivity at the core of the ACC, with enhanced\nvalues on its flanks and at depth where the zonal ve-\nlocity is in the range of 2\u20134 cm s21. We suggest that this\nis strongly indicative of mixing at a critical layer. These\nfindings are consistent with the quasigeostrophic anal-\nysis of SM and the idealized models of Cerovecki et al.\n(2009) and Treguier (1999), with theoretical consider-\nations based on the observed reversal of potential\nvorticity gradients and the steering level of linear baro-\nclinic modes, and with basic kinematics. While we have\nfocused on the mixing of PV, it is important to keep in\nmind that the effective diffusivities diagnosed here apply\nto the mixing of any tracer, be it chemical or biological.\nShuckburgh et al. (2009a) and Salle\u00b4e et al. (2008)\nnoted that at the surface, assessments of eddy mixing\nbased on particle dispersion do not indicate a minimum\nat the core of the ACC. Finite-time Lyapunov expo-\nnents, another possible measurement of eddy stirring,\ncorrelate closely with eddy kinetic energy but do not\nseem to be diminished by strong mean flow, reaching\ntheir highest values in the western boundary currents\nandACC (Waugh andAbraham 2008; Shuckburgh et al.\n2009a,b). Similarly, particle-based results do not seem\nto indicate enhanced mixing below the ACC at depth\n(A. Griesel et al. 2009, unpublishedmanuscript). In light\nof the upcoming DIMES experiments, it is important to\nreconcile these views of eddy mixing. Some progress has\nbeen made on this front by d\u2019Ovidio et al. (2009).\nFIG. 9. The effective isopycnal diffusivity [K\n(i)\neff ; solid lines] and the IPVG (dashed lines) on several different neutral\nsurfaces: gn5 (top to bottom) 27.0, 27.4, 27.8, and 28.0. Only values where the mean isopycnal depth is greater than\n100 m have been plotted. Weaker interior IPVGs correspond with higher effective diffusivities and vice versa.\nJANUARY 2010 ABERNATHEY ET AL . 181\nWe argue that effective diffusivity is a useful metric\nbecause of the dynamically consistent relationship it holds\nwith the IPV gradient. The strong IPV gradient in the\ncore of the ACC acts as a barrier to wave propagation\u2014\nbaroclinically unstable waves propagating in the steering\nlevel on the edge of this gradient break, form closed\neddies, and homogenize the low-PV region equatorward\nof the jet. This conceptual picture bears a close resem-\nblance to the winter stratosphere, where high effective\ndiffusivities in the \u2018\u2018surf zone\u2019\u2019 outside the polar vortex\nare indicative of breaking planetary waves (Haynes and\nShuckburgh 2000a). However, several important dis-\ntinctions complicate this interpretation. The size of\nmesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean is far below the\nplanetary scale. Indeed, the streamwise-averaged view\nnecessarily obscures localized eddy processes such as\ninteractions with particular topographical features (e.g.,\nthe Kerguelen Plateau). This point is underscored by the\nwide variations seen in the effective diffusivity patterns\nbetween sectors. Second, planetary waves in the strato-\nsphere are generally thought to propagate up from the\ntroposphere (McIntyre and Palmer 1983), far below the\ncritical layer they encounter in the stratosphere. There is\nno such spatial separation in the ACC. The eddies arise\nas a result of baroclinic instability and interact with the\ncritical layer in the same region. Perhaps a better atmo-\nspheric analogy is the midlatitude troposphere, where\nintense mixing at the steering level homogenizes PV and\nbrings the mean state closer to neutrality. This process\nhas been studied in the context of baroclinic adjustment\n(Stone 1978; Zurita-Gotor and Lindzen 2004a,b). An-\nother open question is the relationship between this\nlarge-scale mixing structure and the smaller-scale mul-\ntiple jets of the ACC. Thompson (2010) recently con-\nducted an analysis of mixing and multiple-jet formation\nover topography with an eye to the ACC; he found re-\ngions of enhanced mixing between each of the small-\nscale jets. How these small-scale mixing patterns in-\nfluence the large scale is an important question for future\ninvestigation.\nWe have used effective diffusivity profiles to estimate\neddy-induced meridional velocities by parameterizing\nthe eddy QGPV flux. This produced a reasonable pic-\nture; the sense and magnitude of the circulation were\nconsistent with other inferences and models. The pa-\nrameterization using effective diffusivity was compared\nto a constant diffusivity assumption, as in the Gent\u2013\nMcWillams parameterization. We found the greatest\ndifferences to arise from the low values of Keff in the\nACC core and on its poleward flank, rather than from\nthe high values of Keff found near the steering level,\nwhere weak PV gradients dominate. While not quanti-\ntatively rigorous, these estimates show how the trans-\nport barrier in the core of the jet could potentially affect\nthe strength of the meridional overturning circulation.\nWe conclude that the consequences of the variations of\nthe effective diffusivity for the large-scale overturning\ncirculation merit further study.\nAcknowledgments.
