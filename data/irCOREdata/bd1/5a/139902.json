T. Sayle and Dean C. Sayle\nDASSR, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Shrivenham, SN6 8LA, United\nKingdom, d.c.sayle@cranfield.ac.uk\nAbstract\nAtomistic simulations reveal that ceria nanorods, under uniaxial tension, can accommodate over\n9% elastic deformation. Moreover, a fluorite-to-rutile phase change occurs above 6% strain, which\nis reversible upon release of the stress. The elastic energy stored within the nanorod may find\napplication in future \u2018nanogenerators\u2019.\nKeywords: Atomistic Simulation, Microstructure, Molecular Dynamics, nanogenerator.\nMuch effort has been applied to the study of one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanorods and\nnanotubes, because of their unique electrical [1], chemical [2, 3] and mechanical [4] properties, compared to\nthe parent bulk material, with applications spanning: catalysis, to energy storage. However, central to their\napplication in a diverse range of applications is their mechanical durability and \u2018perceived\u2019 fragility. Such\nvulnerability may reflect a structural response to, for example, friction and wear, localised compressive or\ntensile strain attributed to heating\/cooling, operational vibration and for intercalation hosts, used to store\ncharge carriers such as Li ions in rechargeable batteries, structural collapse under charge\/discharge cycles\n[5]. High mechanical strength, toughness and fracture resistance are central to the exploitation of\nnanomaterials in a range of applications spanning biomedical and dental [6] to MEMS [7]. Accordingly, to\nhelp meet such demanding requirements, a fundamental (atomistic) understanding of the mechanical\nproperties and processes of nanomaterials, such as strength and fracture mechanics is needed. However,\ndirect measurement of mechanical load is difficult experimentally - requiring in-situ mechanical\ndeformation testing [8]. Notwithstanding such challenges, Shokuhfar and co-workers measured the\nmechanical compressive properties of individual thin-wall and thick-wall TiO2 nanotubes directly [9] and\nfound that that the Young\u2019s modulus of titanium dioxide nanotubes depended upon the diameter and wall\nthicknessof the nanotube and is in the range of 23-44 GPa; the thin-wall nanotubes collapsed at 1.0 to 1.2 N\nduring axial compression.\nAtomistic computer simulation can be used to simulate mechanical deformation and is well-placed to\ncomplement experiment because the simulations are comparatively easier \u2013 molecular graphics can be used\nto explore the structural transformation during loading. For example, Xiong and co-workers explored\nuniaxial tension on MgO nanorods using molecular dynamics simulation, which revealed the atomic-scale\nmechanism of the deformation and failure process during tension [10]. In particular, they observed increased\nductility at reduced strain rates. However, the difficulty associated with simulation is the generation of a\nstructural model that is sufficiently realistic in that the results generated using the model are of value to\nexperiment. Specifically, the nanorods are unlikely to be structurally perfect; rather they will contain\nmicrostructural features, such as morphology and surfaces exposed, grain-boundaries, dislocations and point\ndefects. Indeed, Koh and Lee predicted that the tensile strength of platinum nanowires can change by up to\n50% by altering the cross-sectional shape of the nanowire [11]. Moreover, is well known that the (measured)\nstrength of a material is about two orders of magnitude less than its estimated ideal strength. This is\nattributed to the presence of microstructural features \u2013 specifically dislocations, which provide vehicles for\nplastic deformation. On the other hand nanomaterials can sustain stresses more that a tenth of their ideal\nstrengths [12] because they are less able to retain a dislocation population within their (size-constrained)\nstructure compared to their bulk counterpart [13].\nTo better understand the unique mechanical properties of nanomaterials, we simulated a nanorod of\nmicrostructural ceria under mechanical load. To generate such models we used simulated amorphisation and\ncrystallisation [14], fig. 1, which is a simulation strategy capable of introducing variety of microstructural\nfeatures into an atomistic model, including for example: surfaces and morphology, point defects and\nclusters, dislocations and grain-boundaries. Ceria is a prototypical, chemically reactive ceramic oxide,\nwhich has been exploited extensively in a wide range of applications including: fuel cells [15], catalysts [16],\nnanoabrasives [17] and sensor [18].\nFigure 1 Strategy used to generate atomistic models for nanorods. (a) amorphous nanoparticles positioned into simulation cell; (b)\nagglomeration of neighbouring nanoparticles in one dimension; (c) evolution of nanorod topography; the nanorod is then\ncrystallised. Atom positions are represented by white and blue spheres (cerium) and red spheres (oxygen). The blue spheres are\nused to show the high mobility of the ions within the molten phase.\na\nb\nc\nResultsand Discussion\nThe structure of the crystalline CeO2 nanorod is shown in fig. 2. The rod is about 10nm in diameter, exposes\n{111} and {100} surfaces facilitating a hexagonal cross-section and extends along the [110] direction in\naccord with experiment [19], fig 2(b,c,d). Experimentally, nanorods with [210] as the principal axis have\nalso been synthesised [20]. We found that by crystallising the nanorod at 3400 instead of 3750 K yielded a\nmodel of a nanorod that extended along [210].\nClose inspection of the atomistic structure of the nanorod, fig 2(a) using molecular graphics, revealed a\ncomplex array of steps, edges and corners on the surface together with point defects that evolved both on\nthe surface and in the bulk regions of the nanorod including cerium and oxygen vacancies and vacancy\nclusters. Such microstructural features are observed experimentally [16]. In particular, similar to real\nnanorods, our model is not simply a rod of ceria cleaved from the bulk material; rather it comprises a rich\nmicrostructure, which is an important feature of the model because this is likely to influence profoundly the\nmechanical strength and thus enable the model to display behaviour, which is more realistic compared to the\nreal material.\nThe behaviour of the nanorod under mechanical load is shown in fig 3 and reveals that the yield strain is\n0.066 with an associated tensile strength of about 18 GPa. The stress-strain trace is curved, which reflects a\nreduced Youngs modulus with increased strain; a straight line is shown as a visual aid. Inspection of the\nnanorod during tensile strain reveals that \u2018crack\u2019 formation emanates from the surface, fig. 4(a). However,\nsurprisingly, upon increased strain, the CeO2 at the crack region undergoes a polymorphic transformation\nfrom fluorite to rutile, fig. 4(b). Moreover rather than suffering complete fracture, the nanorod maintains\nmechanical strength for a further 0.03 strain, at which point the simulation was stopped. Similar to a\n\u2018concertina\u2019, the nanorod accommodates the strain via this phase change; images showing more clearly the\nfluorite and rutile-structured CeO2 are shown in fig. 4 (c); a view looking perpendicular to the structure in\n4(c) is shown in 4(d).\nFigure 2 Models of the ceria nanorod compared with experiment: (a) atomistic model, top: perspective view; middle: view\nlooking along [110] revealing the hexagonal profile of the nanorod; bottom: slice cut through the nanorod revealing the Ce and O\nvacancies that have evolved in the nanorod during (simulated) crystallization.

In particular, 5(a) shows the atomistic structure of a region of the CeO2\nnanorod (3200ps, strain=0.064) that conforms to the fluorite structure, which transforms to rutile after a\nfurther 12.5ps, fig. 5(b). Side views of 5(a) and (b) are shown in 5(c) and (d) respectively.\nInspection of the nanorod after the strain had been released at the end of the uniaxial tension simulation\n(0.093 strain, point C on fig. 3) revealed that it returns to its original configuration, figure 6; domains of\nCeO2 conforming to the rutile polymorph transform back to fluorite. In particular, the simulations suggest\nthat the nanorod undergoes elastic deformation up to about 0.09 strain, which includes a fluorite-to-rutile\nphase change.\nFurther simulations, where the nanorod was tensioned uniaxially beyond a strain of 0.09, revealed that the\nnanorod deforms plastically. In particular, regions in the vicinity of the crack that conform to the rutile\npolymorph, transform structurally back to the fluorite structure. The structure of the nanorod after 0.12\nstrain is shown in fig. 7. Upon release of the strain, the nanorod does not return to its original configuration.\nAnimations of the ceria nanorod under tensile strain, showing more clearly the mechanism underpinning the\nfluorite-rutile phase transformation, are available in supporting information.\nFigure 5 Atomistic structure of the ceria nanorod showing more clearly the fluorite-rutile phase transformation.

Cerium is coloured white and oxygen is red.\na b\nChanges in atomistic structure have been reported for nanorods under strain. In particular, in a gold\nnanowire, simulated under tension, a c.c.p. to b.c.t.1 packing of the metal atoms was predicted [21];\namorphisation of SiC nanowires was observed under deformation [22]; rutile-to-fluorite structural\ntransformations in SnO2 nanorods and nanobelts under 35GPa compression have also been observed [23].\nCrucially, the authors observed that the behaviour of the nanomaterial was (sometimes profoundly) different\ncompared to the parent (bulk) material. Moreover, Agrawal and co-workers reported a wurtzite to body-\ncentred tetragonal phase change in ZnO nanowires [24]. We therefore propose that a fluorite-to-rutile phase\ntransformation in CeO2 nanorods under tension as a precursor to ductile fracture is not unreasonable. In\nparticular, rutile is less dense than fluorite and therefore this phase change offers a mechanism for relieving\nthe strain on the nanorod; we await experimental confirmation. The elastic energy, stored in the ceria\nnanorod associated with the reversible fluorite-rutile phase change, may find possible application in the\nfield of nanogenerators [25] with reversible phase changes providing vehicles for nano-energy storage.\nConclusion\nMost bulk ceramic materials, such as ceria (CeO2) are brittle, which can impact severely upon their\nexploitation in a variety of applications. However, we predict that CeO2 nanorods deform elastically up to\n9% tensile strain. Moreover, above 6% tensile strain, the CeO2 nanorod undergoes a fluorite-to-rutile phase\ntransformation. Upon release of the stress, the nanorod returns to its original configuration; domains of\nrutile-structured CeO2 transform back to the fluorite polymorph.\nAcknowledgement\nEPSRC: EP\/H001220, EP\/H001298, EP\/H005838.\nSupporting Information Available: S1: animation showing a ceria nanorod undergoing a fluorite-rutile\nphase transformation; S2: animation showing the fracture of a ceria nanorod. This material is available free\nof charge via the Internet at http:\/\/pubs.acs.org.\nMethods\nAll calculations, presented in this study, are based upon the Born model of the ionic solid, in which a charge\nis assigned to each atom and the long-range attractive interactions between these charged ions are balanced\nby short-range repulsive (electron-electron) interactions. Model parameters, used to describe CeO2, were\ntaken from ref. [26] and have been reported previously to model the structure of nanoparticles [17], nanorods\n[27] and nanotubes [28] and for calculating important properties including oxygen mobility [28], defect\nformation energy [26]. Accordingly, we suggest that such potential are well suited this present study.\nThe DL_POLY code was used to perform all the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations[29]. All simulations\nwere performed using three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Molecular graphics were performed\nusing VMD [30] and Materials Studio.\nTo generate a ceria nanorod, a \u2018cube\u2019 of CeO2, comprising 15972 atoms (5324 Ce, 10 648 O), was cut from\nthe parent material and the system melted by applying constant volume MD simulation at high temperature\n(8000K); the simulation cell size was sufficiently large to ensure the nanoparticle does not feel any\n(repulsive or attractive) interaction from its periodic neighbours (fig 1a). The size of the simulation cell was\nthen reduced in one dimension to enable the nanoparticle to interact and agglomerate with its periodic\nneighbours (fig. 1b) [27]. MD simulation, performed on the system for 1000ps at 8000K, facilitated the\nevolution of the nanorod (fig 1c). The nanorod was then crystallized by performing MD simulation at\n3750K for sufficient duration to converge the energy. Molecular graphics was used to examine the atomistic\nstructure; nanorods that comprised dislocations or grain-boundaries were discarded because they are likely\nto weaken the nanorods because dislocations are vehicles for plastic deformation; rather nanorods\ncomprising dislocations and\/or grain-boundaries will be considered in a future study.\nThe mechanical properties of the nanorod were calculated by equilibrating the system to the target\ntemperature by performing constant pressure MD simulation at 300K for 100ps with 25ps equilibration,\nprior to simulating tensile and compressive strain, which was achieved by sequential scaling of the atom\ncoordinates and performing constant volume MD simulation at 300K; a strain rate of about 107 s-1 was\nattained.\nReferences\n1 Xia, Y., Yang, P., Sun, Y., Wu, Y., Mayers, B., Gates, B., Yin, Y., Kim, F. & Yan, H.
