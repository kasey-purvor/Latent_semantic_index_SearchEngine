His writings since the 1980s demonstrated a further transition in \nthe identification of social justice by replacing a Marxist and eco-catastrophist epistemology with approaches \ninfluenced by critical realism, poststructuralism and participatory development. Together, these works \ndemonstrated an important engagement with the politics of how environmental explanations are made, and \nthe mutual dependency of social values and environmental knowledge. Yet, today, the lessons of Blaikie\u2019s \nwork are often missed by analysts who ask what is essentially political or ecological about political ecology, \nor by those who argue that a critical approach to environmental knowledge should mean deconstruction \nalone. This paper reviews Blaikie\u2019s work since the 1980s and focuses especially on the meaning of \u2018politics\u2019 \nwithin his approach to political ecology. The paper argues that Blaikie\u2019s key contribution is not just in \nlinking environmental knowledge and politics, but also in showing ways that environmental analysis and \npolicy can be reframed towards addressing the problems of socially vulnerable people. This pragmatic co-\nproduction of environmental knowledge and social values offers a more constructive means of building \nsocially just environmental policy than insisting politics or ecology exist independently of each other, or \nbelieving environmental interventions are futile in a post-Latourian world. \n \nKeywords: political ecology, social vulnerability, epistemology, science studies, soil erosion, Nepal \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nOne of the most distinctive themes in the writings of Piers Blaikie over the years is a strong political \nimperative and desire to correct social injustices. On the first page of The Political Economy of Soil Erosion \nin Developing Countries, Blaikie (1985: 1) wrote: \u2018[this] is not a neutral book. It takes sides and argues a \nposition because soil erosion is a political-economic issue, and even a position of so-called neutrality rests \nupon partisan assumptions\u2019 (emphasis in original). \n \nYet, despite such statements, it has become almost accepted wisdom that Blaikie\u2019s early work was somehow \nunderpoliticized. Reviewing this famous book in 1997, Michael Watts (1997: 77) wrote, \u2018the distinctively \npolitical content of political ecology was (and is) sadly missing in much of Blaikie\u2019s work\u2026\u2019 \n \nWhat does this statement mean about the application of \u2018politics\u2019 in political ecology? At one level, this \ncomment refers to the generally uncomplicated analysis of political processes in Blaikie\u2019s early work \u2013 a \ncriticism Blaikie later acknowledged (Blaikie, 1997: 79). But at a wider level, this statement also indicates \ndifferences in opinion concerning the normative objectives of political ecology versus its analytical \n 1\nprocedures. Blaikie clearly expressed political intentions in his work, but Watts believed his methods were \ninsufficient. \n \nThis paper argues that Piers Blaikie\u2019s writings on political ecology should not be dismissed as being \nunderpoliticized, but instead be seen as important first steps for a new and engaged focus on the politics of \nenvironmental epistemology (or, what we know about environment, with whose inputs, and with what \neffects). Rather than seeking to demonstrate how a particular approach to \u2018politics\u2019 could be applied to \npredefined notions of \u2018environment,\u2019 Blaikie sought instead to demonstrate how social values and \nenvironmental knowledge are co-produced. Moreover, he tried to show that changing these values, or \ndiversifying the social framings of environmental analysis, may result in more socially just environmental \nknowledge and policy. \n \nBut at the same time, Blaikie\u2019s own approach to achieving these objectives changed over time. In the early \n1980s, he and his collaborators relied upon a generally structuralist Marxian analysis of environmental and \nsocial change. After this period, Blaikie rejected structuralist analysis and instead sought more locally \u2013\ndetermined, discursive and participatory approaches to environmental crisis and social vulnerability. These \ndifferent approaches, and their implications for how environmental knowledge is made, have raised further \nchallenges for providing a socially relevant direction to physical environmental science and policy. \n \nThis paper assesses Blaikie\u2019s contributions to political ecology, and in particular his approach to the co-\nproduction of environmental knowledge and social values. The paper starts by reviewing Blaikie\u2019s (and his \ncollaborators) work during  the early 1980s, and then moves on to summarize Blaikie\u2019s proposed alternatives \nto structuralist analysis.  After this, the paper considers the criticisms and dilemmas resulting from this and \npolitical analysis of environmental epistemology in general. The paper concludes by arguing that Blaikie\u2019s \napproach to reframing environmental knowledge in the terms of social justice also offer insights for wider \ndebates about the politicized collection and use of knowledge in environmental analysis. Insights from \ncritical science and the sociology of scientific knowledge may provide useful ways to build on Blaikie\u2019s \nwork.  \n \nA new paradigm? \n \nThe writings of Piers Blaikie and his collaborators in the 1980s represented a significant turning point \ntowards seeing environmental changes in social and political terms. My own experiences as an \nundergraduate offer one small example of how these were seen. Some fellow students and I were planning to \nundertake research in Nepal. When reading about the country, we came across Nepal in Crisis (1980), co-\nauthored by Piers Blaikie, John Cameron and David Seddon. \n \n 2\nNepal in Crisis was different. Most writing about Nepal described the distinctiveness of its cultures and \nlandscapes, or portrayed Nepal as a passive recipient of aid. Nepal in Crisis, however, adopted a structural \nglobal political economy approach to explain social marginalization and environmental degradation \nsimultaneously. Indeed, the image of combined economic and ecological decline was both urgent and \nworrying: \nNepal is now in a state of crisis, fundamentally rooted in a failure of productive \norganization associated with its economic and political underdevelopment. Already \nthere are frequent famines, and the processes of erosion and ecological decline, coupled \nwith continuing population growth, will contribute to an increase in apparently \u2018natural\u2019 \ndisasters in the future (Blaikie, Cameron and Seddon, 1980: 5). \n \nIt is worth noting that today, these and other authors now criticize this vision and especially the so-called \n\u2018Theory of Himalayan Environmental Degradation\u2019 \u2013 in which population pressure and commercialization \nmay lead to a downward spiral of deforestation and land failure (Blaikie, Cameron and Seddon, 2002; \nBlaikie and Muldavin, 2004; Ives, 2004). But for we callow students at the time, this was exciting stuff. To \ndate, we had only studied \u2018soil erosion\u2019 as a dry geomorphological subject, where the writings of scientists \nsuch as Schumm or Trimble highlighted presented erosion in terms of thresholds or tradeoffs of biophysical \nsurface processes. In the writings of Blaikie and his colleagues, however, erosion was a symptom of \ndysfunctional societies and economies, and impacted mainly on the poorest and most vulnerable people. \n \nThis approach was later expanded in Blaikie\u2019s single-authored book, The Political Economy of Soil Erosion \nin Developing Countries (1985), This work both elaborated the political discussion of erosion\u2019s causes and \nimpacts, and recognized the diverse social contexts in which erosion is considered problematic. Crucially, \nthe point behind Blaikie\u2019s work seemed to be a radical approach to epistemology \u2013 suggested by works such \nas Richard Peet\u2019s Radical Geography (1977) \u2013 that empiricism itself was political, and researchers should \nnot accept orthodox explanations of problems from physical science or expert agencies uncritically. Unlike \northodox approaches to soil erosion, Blaikie\u2019s work suggested that researchers had the opportunity to create \nnew and more socially just worlds by refocusing scientific research in line with development objectives. \nRather geekishly, we wondered: Is this a paradigm shift occurring before our eyes?  \n \nAccording to Blaikie, this was a paradigm shift. He wrote: \u2018[it] is not just a question of a comprehensive and \nintellectually satisfying method for studying soil erosion. The approach here is in direct conflict with both \nthe dominant conventional wisdom about soil erosion\u2026 and with the institutions charged to deal with it\u2019 \n(1983: 29). And that paradigm shift was decidedly political. The final chapter of Political Economy of Soil \nErosion pointed to vested interests in both creating and measuring erosion: \u2018a principal conclusion of this \nbook is that soil erosion in lesser developed countries will not be substantially reduced unless it seriously \nthreatens the accumulation possibilities of the dominant classes\u2019 (Blaikie, 1985: 147). \n \n 3\nBut by this stage, it was also clear that these approaches were being questioned. Nepal in Crisis and other \nworks (Blaikie, 1981, 1983) adopted an approach decidedly rooted in structural Marxian political economy. \nThe Political Economy of Soil Erosion, however, began to acknowledge more diverse root causes of \ndegradation, and examined the social and institutional influences on environmental knowledge itself. These \nalternative influences became more prominent in Blaikie\u2019s writings after the 1980s. \n \n \nAlternatives to structuralism \n \nIf Blaikie\u2019s work in the early 1980s linked structural Marxism with environmental crisis, his writings since \nhave sought to replace Marxian political economy and eco-catastrophism with alternative means of defining \nenvironmental change and social justice. These new approaches asked two key questions: How do we \nunderstand environmental crisis? And how do we identify social vulnerability? \n \nConcerning environmental explanation, some initial steps were achieved in the edited volume, Land \nDegradation and Society (Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987). This work expanded the discussion of social \ncontexts of environmental meaning begun in Political Economy of Soil Erosion by emphasizing the historical \nelements of environmental change, the importance of social marginalization, and the political influences on \nhow environment is measured. Today, this book may be seen as early discussions of what are now called \ncritical science, or science studies. Moving away from simply measuring \u2018erosion,\u2019 Blaikie and Brookfield \n(1987: xix) wrote: \u2018it therefore becomes necessary to examine critically the political, social and economic \ncontent of seemingly physical and \u201capolitical\u201d measures such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation, the \u201cT\u201d \nfactor and erodibility\u2019. (The \u2018T\u2019 factor is used in some hydrological models to describe the distance between \nthe top of a slope and the start of overland runoff; the Universal Soil Loss Equation is a widely adopted \npredictive tool of erosion based on research in the USA). \n \nIn turn, this new focus on the politics environmental explanation also encouraged a rethink of a priori \nassumptions about structural connections of capitalism and environmental degradation. Blaikie later wrote \nregarding desertification:  \nThe case for the globalization of capital being causal in desertification looks rather \namateur, since the scientific evidence of permanent damage to the environment points \nin other directions\u2026 For want of attention to a large and accessible body of \nclimatological and ecological information, the case for the adding desertification to the \nlong list of other socially induced woes now looks very thin (Blaikie, 1995: 12). \n \nThese transitions in Blaikie\u2019s approach both reflected, and contributed to, two broader changes in political \necology. First, many analysts adopted insights from poststructural debates about the political origin and \ninstitutionalization of environmental knowledge, and especially the role of environmental discourses and \n 4\nnarratives. Environmental narratives have been defined as convenient yet simplistic beliefs about the nature, \ncauses and impacts of environmental problems, which also influence the generation of further environmental \nresearch and proposed solutions (Leach and Mearns, 1996). For example, Roe (1991) argued that the well \nknown parable of the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 is repeated in various forms of development and \nenvironmental practice, yet is based on simplistic a priori assumptions about how environment is fragile, and \nhow individuals act politically. Rather than considering whether these statements are \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 in \northodox scientific terms, poststructuralist narrative analysis aims to identify how these statements of \npresumed certainty have been \u2018stabilized\u2019 by selective social processes, with the implication of reinforcing \ncertain political objectives.. \n \nThe second transition in political ecology was an increased awareness of the limits of ecological notions of \nstability and equilibrium that underlie many popular narratives of environmental change and crisis. Botkin \n(1990), Rocheleau et al (1996), Turner (1993) and Zimmerer (2000), for example, have discussed concepts \nof non-equilibrium ecology to show that it is very difficult to make confident statements about long-term \necological responsiveness based on limited temporal and spatial data, and when the evaluations and \nmeasurements of ecology are influenced by humans in culturally (and sometimes gender) specific ways. \nIndeed, these and other authors have argued that non-equilibrium views about ecology also empower the \npolitical analysis of environmental knowledge because they can show how resource management \nframeworks are co-produced with visions of ecological stability. Policies that restrict livelihood activities \nsuch as smallholder agriculture have often been justified using equilibrium, or \u2018nature in balance\u2019 arguments. \nUsing non-equilibrium frameworks, however, may empower local resource users\u2019 strategies as both \necologically and developmentally feasible alternatives (although it is possible to take these local strategies \ntoo far) (Adams, 1997). \n \nConsequently, much research within political ecology since the 1980s has focused on how and why \ninstitutionalized beliefs about environmental change come into place, and on finding alternative, more \ninclusive, ways of addressing environmental problems. In Nepal, as discussed, the so-called Theory of \nHimalayan Degradation has been shown to be a simplistic and unrepresentative indication of environmental \nor social change (Thompson et al, 1986; Ives and Messerli, 1989; Ives, 2004). Other narrative work includes \nthe argument that smallholder farmers are not as responsible as commonly thought for deforestation in West \nAfrica (Fairhead and Leach, 1996); or that desiccation and desertification may not result primarily from \novergrazing or human settlement in drylands (Bassett and Zu\u00e9li, 2000). Indeed, the political use of \u2018crisis\u2019 \nhas emerged as a further theme of analyzing narratives, where it is argued, in Roe\u2019s words (1995: 1066): \n\u2018Crisis narratives are the primary means whereby development experts and the institutions for which they \nwork claim rights to stewardship over land and resources they do not own.\u2019 \n \nBlaikie\u2019s work connected in various ways with these themes. The book, Nepal in Crisis was clearly a crisis \nnarrative: but does this mean there is no \u2018crisis\u2019 in Nepal? Blaikie and his co-authors sought to clarify this \n 5\nquestion by updating the book, and publishing a paper that acknowledged the first edition of Nepal in Crisis \nhad mistakenly inferred too universally from the logic of the capitalist mode of production. Nepal had not \nslid into environmental collapse or deepening poverty (although, clearly there has been political disturbances \nand poor people continue to suffer from land appropriation and lack of commercial opportunities). Rather \nthan denying any environmental or developmental problems, the authors argued that the narrative of crisis \nsometimes blinded researchers to what actually was happening (Blaikie, Cameron and Seddon, 2002: 1267). \nThese works therefore differed from Blaikie\u2019s 1980s writings by adopting an epistemology that avoided the a \npriori structural links of capitalism, social vulnerability and environmental crisis, but instead showed how \nenvironmental knowledge could contribute to vulnerability. Indeed, a further co-written paper demonstrated \nhow the Theory of Himalayan Degradation had evolved to be a discursive political strategy by the state to \nlegitimize control over resources and people (Blaikie and Muldavin, 2004: 520). \n \nThese writings were also relevant to Blaikie\u2019s other writings on defining social vulnerability and \nenvironmental risk. As with his environmental research in the 1980s, Blaikie largely identified social \nvulnerability through a Marxian political economy analysis of dominant and marginalized classes \n(sometimes also mapped onto spatial areas such as Nepal itself). His later work sought to find alternative, \nand more empowering ways of identifying development problems. Here, the book At Risk (Blaikie et al, \n1994, reissued as Wisner et al, 2004), co-authored with Terry Cannon, Ian Davis and Ben Wisner, considered \na more complex analysis of vulnerability, and adopted insights from Amartya Sen concerning the \nconstruction of adaptive capacity through more participatory approaches to development.  \n \nAt Risk criticized approaches that blamed \u2018natural\u2019 hazards on physical processes, or insufficient engineering \ntechnology alone, and instead explored two models of explaining social vulnerability. The \u2018Pressure and \nRelease\u2019 model identifies different levels of structural causes of vulnerability \u2013 such as long-term poverty, or \nlack of institutions \u2013 which may make specific locations or people vulnerable to physical events. The \n\u2018Access\u2019 model, however, borrows more clearly from Senian concepts of entitlements and capabilities. \n\u2018Access involves the ability of an individual, family, group, class or community to use resources which are \ndirectly required to secure a livelihood in normal, pre-disaster times, and their ability to adapt to new and \nthreatening situations\u2019 (Wisner et al, 2004: 94). The difference between these two models in part reflected \nBlaikie\u2019s own transition from looking at large-scale transitions in social and political causes of vulnerability \n(often involving the state and international political economy), towards seeing vulnerability from the \nviewpoint of the poor, and often in terms other than environmental change itself. By doing this, Blaikie and \nhis colleagues adopted a radically different approach to identifying environmental risk than that applied by \nsome analysts of global environmental change, who have proposed that \u2018regions\u2019 \u2013 rather than individuals or \nsocial groups \u2013 may be \u2018at risk\u2019 (e.g. Kasperson et al, 1995). \n \nThese new themes in Blaikie\u2019s work demonstrated a rejection of the old Marxian explanations of \nenvironmental degradation and social marginalization, and the adoption of newer, more locally determined \n 6\napproaches. Yet, despite these changes, Blaikie has also criticized some new themes in political ecology for \nnot being focused enough on political objectives, or for failing to provide sufficiently grounded explanations \nof physical environmental change. On one hand, he praised poststructuralist analysis for overcoming many \nof the simplifications and a priorism of structuralism: \nthese [poststructuralist] studies\u2026 emphasize politics rather than economics, alternative \naccounts of reality rather than the author\u2019s own environmental and social data, and \nagency and resistance, rather than structural inequality (Blaikie, 1999: 133). \n \nBut simultaneously, he demonstrated frustration with the relativism and deconstruction associated with some \npoststructuralist approaches: \nThere are undoubtedly formidable problems when attempting to make causal \nconnections between social and environmental processes\u2026 there are usually so many \nintervening variables that the project may seem like trying to find a needle in a haystack \nwhen, as poststructuralist critics might add, you cannot find the haystack\u2026 It could be \npointed out that all except the most discursive deconstructionists attempt to establish \nexactly the same type of causal relations, even if they do not take explicit \nepistemological responsibility for it (Blaikie, 1999: 140). \n \nIndeed, Blaikie also pointed out (somewhat stereotypically?) that poststructuralist deconstruction of \nnarratives \u2018seldom attempts to fill the vacuum which results from deconstruction with its own version of \nenvironmental or social truth,\u2019 and that much deconstruction of colonial science \u2018owes much more to \nmodernist and realist science than to any post-modern deconstruction\u2019 (Blaikie, 1999:142-3). Accordingly, \nrather than just engage in the deconstruction of environmental narratives, some of Blaikie\u2019s work also sought \nto engage in reconstructing a more epistemologically realist form of explanation that was of greater \nassistance to vulnerable people. For example, one co-authored study about soil degradation in Botswana \nincorporated both a deconstruction of multiple perspectives of environmental change by attempting to \nprovide \u2018closure\u2019 (or clarification) concerning which perspective might suit available evidence (Dahlberg \nand Blaikie, 1999). Under this approach, the authors sought \u2018closure\u2019 by generating datasets based upon the \ndifferent perspectives about soil degradation, and then triangulating them by seeking similarities and \ndifferences in the data collected.  In this way, Blaikie used poststructuralist insights to acknowledge plural \nperspectives on soil degradation, and to eschew the belief that there was \u2018one\u2019 accurate version of \nbiophysical problems. But in addition, he acknowledged that using these perspectives side-by-side could help \nshow which versions were not supported by evidence. Moreover, he could also make this research more \nhelpful to the needs of poor people by organizing this analysis to address their own experiences and \nproblems of soil degradation. (Of course, Blaikie is not the only one to try this: a similar approach was taken \nto testing different definitions of forest and forestland by Robbins, 2001; these approaches have been called \n\u2018hybrid science\u2019, see Forsyth, 2003: 224-6). \n \n 7\nBy adopting these techniques, Blaikie demonstrated he was not simply content with poststructuralist analysis \nthat focuses only upon deconstructing narratives (such as by showing how they reflect historical political \nmeanings and partial social participation). Rather, he was also arguing for a more critical way to reconstruct \nenvironmental explanations by making the normative connections between social values and different \nknowledge claims transparent, and by prioritizing the needs of vulnerable people when building newer \nexplanations. Indeed, Blaikie foreshadowed this approach in his earlier statement on page 1 of Political \nEconomy of Soil Erosion when he stated he would \u2018take sides.\u2019 \n \nAnd in turn, these insights show two further things. First, philosophically, Blaikie was clearly experimenting \nwith forms ofskeptical, or critical realism because he sought to achieve some level of scientific progress in a \nworld where knowledge claims reflect current and historic power relations (Hannah, 1999). Under the \ndiscussion of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar (1975), our understanding of \u2018externally real\u2019 items such as \nsoil erosion, rainfall, or tree growth, is often likened to \u2018peeling the layers off an onion\u2019 because it \ndistinguishes between \u2018actual\u2019 observations (day-to-day experiences), \u2018empirical\u2019 measurements (scientific \nresearch) and these insights these give about \u2018real\u2019 structures (underlying causes). Blaikie was effectively \nimplementing this in his search for \u2018closure\u2019 and his triangulation of multiple information sources. \n \nYet in addition, Blaikie was also showing a tactical interest in influencing scientific or policy networks by \nacknowledging that knowledge also had to be considered legitimate. Optimistically, he noted (1999: 144), \n\u2018by adopting an epistemology which avoids relativism and unreconstructed pluralism, it may be possible to \naddress specific audiences in languages they recognize to identify real and feasible choices.\u2019 \n \nBut Blaikie\u2019s suggestions about the problems of structuralism, and the need for reconstructed environmental \nexplanations have also been questioned and need further discussion. \n \nQuestions and challenges \n \nBoth the poststructuralist trends in political ecology and Blaikie\u2019s revisions to these have been criticized by \nobservers who have seen either too little or too much structure or politics in explaining or addressing \nenvironmental degradation. Two common questions are: where is the politics, or where is the ecology, in \npolitical ecology? (e.g. Walker, 2005). \n \nInitial responses to Blaikie\u2019s writings on political ecology in the 1980s claimed that his political analysis was \ntoo shallow. In his original review of Political Economy of Soil Erosion, Watts (1986: 305, 304) commented \nthat \u2018the scope of this book is of course much too large,\u2019 and that the \u2018intellectual scaffolding\u2019 chosen by \nBlaikie of marginalization, proletarianization and incorporation, were too broad and pessimistic. He \ncommented, \u2018I am also still unsure quite how soil erosion enters the rough and tumble of everyday politics\u2019 \n(Watts, 1986: 305). Peet and Watts (1996: 8) later claimed that the \u2018chain of explanation\u2019 methodology \n 8\nadopted by Blaikie and Brookfield (1987) \u2013 which was originally presented as crude box diagrams in \nPolitical Economy of Soil Erosion and earlier papers (Blaikie 1981, 1983) \u2013 was \u2018an extremely diluted, \ndiffuse, and on occasion voluntarist series of explanations\u2019 (Peet and Watts, 1996: 8).  \n \nSome other themes of these early criticisms were that Blaikie\u2019s political analysis did not engage closely \nenough with how structural capitalism impacted on politics, or that Blaikie\u2019s work was too concerned with \nphysical aspects of environmental change. Peet and Watts (1996: 6) commented that Land Degradation and \nSociety was too \u2018land\u2019 focused, and urged more attention to the interactions between local communities and \nglobal forces in political ecology. They emphasized the link between political ecology and global capitalism \nby writing:: \u2018Forged in the crucible of Marxian or neo-Marxian development theory, \u2026\u201cpolitical ecology\u201d \nwas \u2026inspired \u2026by peasant and agrarian societies in the throes of complex forms of capitalist transition\u2019 \n(Peet and Watts, 1996: 5).  \n \nBryant and Bailey (1997: 6) echoed this uneasiness about the physical focus of some political ecology, citing: \n\u2018Political ecologists tend to favor consideration of the political over the ecological\u2026 Yet greater attention by \npolitical ecologists to ecological processes does not alter the need for a basic focus on politics as part of the \nattempt to understand Third World environmental problems.\u2019 They also reiterated structural political analysis \nby proposing that political ecology should chiefly focus on the actions of non-state actors, and particularly on \nthe usual positionality of state and industry actors in opposition to NGOs and grassroots activists. (Of course, \nit is worth noting that all these authors have since moved on in various ways). \n \nIn response to these criticisms, Blaikie admitted that \u2018Watts is right to identify the neglect of politics in Soil \nErosion. The intellectual repertoire which I had at the time was drawn from structural Marxism, cultural \necology and a very grounded connection between people and the resources they used\u2019 (Blaikie, 1997: 79). \nBut these early criticisms of Blaikie\u2019s political ecology may also be questioned. In particular, did they imply \nthat \u2018politics\u2019 in political ecology should be about conflicts between different actors without also questioning \nhow apparently physical artifacts are denoted? These questions, of course, have recently been discussed \nlargely by work of poststructuralist authors such as Latour (1993) \u2013 who have suggested that nature-society \nlinkages should be seen as hybrids \u2013 or discourse theorists such as Hajer (1995) \u2013 who have explained how \ndiscourse-coalitions can reify beliefs about physical reality. Moreover, a further theme of political ecology \ntoday is how far environmental discourses and actors\u2019 positionality might not be predictable, as suggested by \nthe common opposition of NGOs and transnational corporations \u2013 that positionality and actors themselves \nmay reflect less obvious expressions of power (e.g. Agrawal, 2005). But it may be fair to say that the work \nBlaikie (1985) or Blaikie and Brookfield (1987) did pioneer the analysis of environmental science and \nartifacts as politicized objects within political ecology, and to call this apolitical may be to suggest a divide \nbetween nature and society that many now question. \n \n 9\nOthers have also questioned how far the new political ecology is \u2018ecological.\u2019 Here, it is the opposite side of \nthe coin. One commonly heard fear is that linking politics and environmental knowledge may mean a loss of \nscientific realism or engagement with pragmatic politics. Ecological scientists such as Vayda and Walters \n(1999) have complained that political ecology is now too absorbed with exploring social structures than \nunderstanding environmental change (a point partly reiterated by Walker, 2005). Other authors have also \nquestioned how far political ecology engages with or theorizes detailed patterns of ecological change \n(Zimmerer, 2000; Bassett, 2001). In a different vein, moreover, some structural Marxists have worried that \nnewer, poststructuralist political ecology might take too much attention away from the still serious impacts \nof capitalism. For example, Bernstein and Woodhouse (2001) suggested \u2018telling environmental change as it \nis\u2019 should mean reverting to structuralist explanations of environmental degradation, and suggested that the \ndeconstruction of environmental narratives by Leach and Mearns (1996) effectively romanticizes local \nknowledge and overlooks the impacts of commodified agriculture in Africa. \n \nThese specific arguments took place in journals associated with Development or Environmental Studies. \nSome debates in Geography journals, however, have presented this basic conflict between structuralist and \npoststructuralist forms of analysis more specifically as an assessment of the values of actor network theory as \nthe preferred method of some poststructuralist geographers (see Castree, 2002). Actor-network is an \napproach to understanding the distinction between \u2018society\u2019 and \u2018nature\u2019 that takes into account the history \nand partial social participation that lead to these boundaries being drawn. Additionally, some analysts have \nused actor network theory to refer to the \u2018symmetry\u2019 (rather than pre-existence) of social structures and \nenvironmental truth claims. According to one discussion, proponents of this approach argue, typically, that \n\u2018analyses premised on further refining the nature of the relationship between categories presumed to be \nseparate and pure are, at best, obfuscatory\u2019 (Bakker and Bridge, 2006: 6). Opponents, however, claim such \nstatements are engaging in a disabling form of relativism: \u2018[it] has no way of distinguishing among \u2018things\u2019 \u2013 \nthings of different powers, and things of different ontological properties \u2013 save only as an effect\u2019 (Kirsch and \nMitchell, 2004: 689). \n \nSuch debates need clarifying regarding Blaikie\u2019s own positions. First, it is clear that, while Blaikie has \novertly engaged in deconstructing environmental narratives, he has also been assertive in seeking an \nunderlying realist contribution to environmental explanation. He wrote:  \nA counterweight to the deconstruction of science must also be provided. A case could \nbe made that the bulk of what is styled as political ecology has been written by social \nscientists, who have paid little attention to what natural scientists have had to say about \ntheir environments, usually with embarrassing results (Blaikie, 1995: 11). \n \nSecond, Blaikie\u2019s approach to deconstruction has not been an unlimited relativism, which rejects the \npossibility of making any truth claims independently of social solidarities. Rather, he has urged attention to \nwhich social solidarities create truth claims, and identifying the social justice of listening to these different \n 10\ngroups. The concept of \u2018closure\u2019 discussed above (Dahlberg and Blaikie, 1999) is not Popperian falsification, \nbased on comparing alternative universalistic hypotheses, but rather a process of inquiry inspired more by \nthe philosopher of science Willard Quine, which seeks to indicate the social embedding of truth claims \n(Morad, 2004). This approach may create localized understandings of environmental processes rather than \nuniversal scientific statements that are usually applied out of context. In Blaikie\u2019s case, this approach also \nmay achieve more developmentally friendly environmental policies based on empowering poor people to \ndefine environmental problems and contribute knowledge about them. These approaches are, in the words of \nPoon (2005), \u2018not positively positivist.\u2019 \n \nAnd third, the rejection of environmental narratives does not mean that environmental inquiry or \ndevelopment should ignore the inequalities arising from capitalism or similar structures. Indeed, Basset \n(2001) provides examples of how institutional arrangements may reduce impacts of plantation cotton \nproduction on environment and poverty in Cote D\u2019Ivoire. Rather, it is the implosion of politics or \nenvironment to old assumptions of structural frameworks that should be avoided. Kirsch and Mitchell (2004, \n690) suggest that this combination of networks and structures could be called \u2018structural questions of \nnetworked agency.\u2019 Similarly, some of the contrasting worldviews associated with environmental narratives \nmay still exist despite deconstruction. For example, it is still clear that media and political lobbies still create \neco-optimist, and eco-pessimist positions, despite researchers demonstrating such positions are simplistic \n(Thompson et al, 1986). \n \nThe implication of these points is that Blaikie\u2019s approach to political ecology represents an integration of \nenvironmental knowledge and social justice that is not yet fully adopted or understood in all environmental \ndebates. As Castree (2002) noted, the common opposition made between actor network theory and Marxism \nis usually misplaced. But Blaikie is making an additional point of using a critical epistemology to generate \ninformation about vulnerability and environmental problems in order to assist important developmental \nproblems. As Blaikie has known since Nepal in Crisis, many researchers or activists want to make a \ndifference, but often do so on the basis of an inadequate, or overly generalized perception of the problem. \nThis is not to reject social justice as a basis for undertaking research, but to question more thoroughly how \nwe have come to see environmental change and social inequality, and to ensure that our interventions reflect \nthis skepticism. \n \nFor these reasons, Blaikie\u2019s approach to political ecology can be seen to be more than either the \ndeconstruction of environmental narratives (in the manner of much poststructuralist analysis), nor trying to \nexplain environmental change more accurately by \u2018peeling the onion\u2019 (in the critical realist sense). Rather, it \nis a politicized acknowledgement of the co-production of environmental knowledge and social values in \nways that, tentatively, try to reconstruct environmental explanations and interventions in the favor of \nvulnerable people. This reframing has arisen, in part, because many empirical challenges to environmental \nnarratives have come from studies of marginalized people who are delegitimized under environmental \n 11\nnarratives (such as, shifting cultivators and hill farmers), plus many political ecologists have tried to \nempower socially vulnerable groups by careful participatory research or by building political arenas where \nthey can speak (Escobar, 1996). This kind of political ecology acknowledges that social values and \nenvironmental knowledge are coproduced, but also endorses a normative agenda to research that allows \nsocially vulnerable people to participate in shaping future knowledge generation. (Still somewhat geekishly, \nI once tried to express this argument in a workshop paper entitled, \u2018Peeling the onion or sharing the knife?\u2019) \n \n \nConclusion: On being political in political ecology \n \nThis paper has reviewed the work of Piers Blaikie on political ecology to demonstrate his contribution to \nunderstanding the politics of environmental epistemology, and to highlight some important remaining \nchallenges for environmental analysis. Much general debate about politics and ecology try to identify a \npriori definitions of politics or ecology, which overlook how the two are linked. Yet, against this, too many \nacademics argue that linking ecology and politics implies the disabling position that no political \ninterventions or environmental explanations can be undertaken. This paper \u2013 and Blaikie \u2013 argues this is a \nfalse choice. \n \nIndeed, it is not just Blaikie who has said as much. Other debates, chiefly in science studies, have also \nconsidered the dilemmas of critical epistemology and political action. Jasanoff (1996: 393, 412), for example, \nwrote: \u2018broadly speaking, [there] are concerns about the uneasy fit between epistemological relativism and \nnormative belief or action.\u2019 But \u2018by adopting a relativizing pose with respect to particular claims of \nknowledge, science studies does not abandon the commitment to be explanatory and normative.\u2019 \n \nFor this reason, this paper argues that political ecologists should not ask whether Blaikie\u2019s most famous work \nwas sufficiently political or not, but rather seek ways to apply his form of politics more successfully. As Low \nand Gleeson (1997) have also suggested, we need to question our assumptions about social justice if we are \nto achieve it more effectively. Applying Blaikie\u2019s lessons may therefore require questioning many of the \ndualisms that seem to define how we conduct political ecology these days. \n \nFirst, there is an assumption that ecological research may fall into categories that are broadly \nepistemologically realist or relativist. Here, it is important to note that even strong forms of scientific realism \nreflect social structures, and that seeking less strong approaches to realism are based upon experiences of \nenvironmental change that are transparently and locally bound to the social groups that find them meaningful \n(see Dahlberg and Blaikie, 1999). At such points, there is little difference between realism and relativism. \nBeing \u2018relativist\u2019 therefore does not necessarily mean suggesting no locally grounded \u2018truths\u2019 can be found. \nYet, being \u2018realist\u2019 does not necessarily mean denying social influence. To date, much deconstruction of \nenvironmental narratives has attacked na\u00efve simplifications of environmental change for political objectives. \n 12\nBut more work can be done on reconstructing alternative environmental explanations to replace these \nnarratives. Linked to this, there is also a need to question how far scientific method or other forms of \nlegitimacy (such as notions of expertise) are powerful in gaining authority in environmental policy. Debates \nin science studies and the sociology of scientific knowledge offer important avenues to pursue these \nquestions. \n \nSecond, more attention should be given to whether the politicizing of environmental truth claims should be \nconducted through the idioms of symmetry or coproduction. Classically, the concept of symmetry has \nimplied that each truth claim has its associated social structure and consequently researchers should see how \ndifferent claims (and associated upholding structures) emerge. (This approach is often associated with actor-\nnetwork theory). In contrast, coproduction focuses instead on the mechanisms by which visions of social \norder give rise to associated knowledge and vice versa. Consequently, rethinking knowledge or social order \nmay therefore allow the creative or positive reconstruction of both environmental understanding and politics, \nsuch as in favor of vulnerable people, as Blaikie has argued. This is a more positive and interventionist \napproach to environment and social justice than classical positions adopted from symmetry (Jasanoff, 1996, \n2004). \n \nAnd thirdly, political ecologists need to consider the relationship of facts and norms in both political and \necological analysis. Some early criticisms of Blaikie\u2019s work claimed he was insufficiently political because \nhe did not look at struggles between villagers, transnational corporations and centralized states. But these \ncriticisms overlooked the highly normative motivation to his work, and his pioneering attempts to show the \npoliticized measurement of environment. Moreover, political ecologists are increasingly noting how \nuncritical environmental science and structural politics give rise to environmental narratives and beliefs that \nare simplistic and frequently unhelpful to poor people. Political ecology should not adopt separate \nunderstandings of politics or ecology, or see one as a guide to the other. The challenge for political ecology \nlies in understanding both environmental and political change in ways that enhance social justice, but which \ndo not impose a priori notions about each. \n 13\nAcknowledgement \n \nThe author would like to thank two anonymous referees for useful comments.\n 14\n References \n \nAdams, W.
