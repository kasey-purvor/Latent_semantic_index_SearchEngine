NO2 measurements during 1990\u20132007, obtained\nfrom a zenith-sky spectrometer in the Antarctic, are analysed\nto determine the long-term changes in NO2. An atmospheric\nphotochemical box model and a radiative transfer model are\nused to improve the accuracy of determination of the vertical\ncolumns from the slant column measurements, and to deduce\nthe amount of NOy from NO2. We find that the NO2 and\nNOy columns in midsummer have large inter-annual variabil-\nity superimposed on a broad maximum in 2000, with little or\nno overall trend over the full time period. These changes\nare robust to a variety of alternative settings when determin-\ning vertical columns from slant columns or determining NOy\nfrom NO2. They may signify similar changes in speed of\nthe Brewer-Dobson circulation but with opposite sign, i.e. a\nbroad minimum around 2000. Multiple regressions show sig-\nnificant correlation with solar and quasi-biennial-oscillation\nindices, and weak correlation with El Nino, but no signifi-\ncant overall trend, corresponding to an increase in Brewer-\nDobson circulation of 1.4\u00b13.5%\/decade. There remains an\nunexplained cycle of amplitude and period at least 15% and\n17 years, with minimum speed in about 2000.\n1 Introduction\nThe circulation whereby air enters the stratosphere in the\ntropics, continues toward the winter pole, and returns to\nthe troposphere via tropopause folds at mid-latitudes, is\nknown as the Brewer-Dobson circulation after its discoverers\n(Brewer, 1949; Dobson, 1956). It is now known to be driven\nby the breaking of planetary-scale Rossby waves and of grav-\nity waves, against the mean zonal winds, in the stratosphere\nand mesosphere. This provides the necessary friction-like\nCorrespondence to: H. K. Roscoe\n(hkro@bas.ac.uk)\nforce to allow poleward flow on a rotating earth in an other-\nwise almost frictionless fluid.\nChanges in the speed of the Brewer-Dobson circulation\nwill affect the stratospheric concentrations of longer-lived\ntrace gases whose sources are in the troposphere (e.g. CFCs,\nCH4, N2O), as well as of their eventual stratospheric prod-\nucts (e.g. reactive chlorine gases, H2O, reactive nitrogen\ngases). Changes in its speed will also affect the tropospheric\nconcentrations of trace gases with large sources in the strato-\nsphere (e.g. ozone). Because these gases are important to\natmospheric climate and chemistry, it is important to know\nwhat changes have occurred to the Brewer-Dobson circula-\ntion in the past and will occur in future. A slowing of the\ncirculation would allow more time in the stratosphere for the\nreactions of N2O to reactive nitrogen. Hence, if tropospheric\nN2O and other factors remained constant, an upwards trend\nin the vertical column of reactive nitrogen gases in the strato-\nsphere would indicate a slowing of the circulation.\nTropospheric N2O is increasing by about 2.5%\/decade\n(WMO 2007), but measured slant columns of NO2 from\nLauder, New Zealand (45\u25e6 S) between 1980 and 1998 show\nan upwards trend of about 5%\/decade (Liley et al., 2000),\ndemonstrating that further processes are involved, several\nof which were discussed and evaluated by McLinden et\nal. (2001).\nThe speed of the Brewer-Dobson circulation will change\nas planetary and gravity wave intensities are changed, for\nexample due to increased greenhouse gases or to volcanic\naerosol. Most climate models suggest that the speed of the\nBrewer-Dobson circulation should increase as greenhouse\ngases increase (see Sect. 6). But changes in wave amplitudes\nare difficult to accurately diagnose from meteorological anal-\nyses, particularly for gravity waves, most of which are below\nthe grid scale of current analysis models.\nIn this paper, we assess trends in stratospheric reactive ni-\ntrogen in the hope that it can be used to diagnose changes in\nthe Brewer-Dobson circulation. We examine trends in NO2\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3602 P. A. Cook and H. K. Roscoe: Variability and trends in stratospheric NO2\nin the Antarctic summer, where it is easy to calculate the im-\nplied total reactive nitrogen because of the almost complete\nabsence of N2O5, an otherwise important component of the\nreactive nitrogen family. N2O5 also hydrolyses on aerosol,\nthereby converting NO2 to HNO3, so its comparative absence\nin the Antarctic summer means that NO2 is little affected by\nstratospheric aerosol.\nWe use NO2 data from a zenith-sky spectrometer that was\nset up at Faraday in the Antarctic (65.25\u25e6 S, 64.27\u25e6 W) be-\ntween 1990 and 1995, and has now been at the nearby site of\nRothera (67.57\u25e6 S, 68.13\u25e6 W) since 1996, providing almost\ncontinuous measurements of Antarctic NO2 since before the\neruption of Mt. Pinatubo (Roscoe et al., 2001; Roscoe, 2004).\n2 Apparatus and spectral analysis\nZenith-sky spectrometers, which continuously look at the\nzenith and record the spectra of scattered sunlight to ob-\ntain slant columns of NO2 and ozone, have been used in the\nAntarctic for many years (Mount et al., 1987; Pommereau\nand Goutail, 1988a and 1988b). Our instrument was of the\nSAOZ design the latter describe. Briefly, a small spectrom-\neter with resolution about 1 nm is housed in an outdoor box,\nobserving light from 300 to 600 nm. An ambient-temperature\narray detector observes all the spectrum at once, so that\nclouds passing the overhead scene do not impart spectral\nnoise, unlike a scanning spectrometer. Spectra are recorded\nby an indoor computer.\nThe amount of NO2 is analysed by fitting differential labo-\nratory cross-sections to the differential optical depths derived\nfrom the observed atmospheric spectra (Platt et al., 1979).\nBecause scattered sunlight is used, the light path through the\natmosphere will depend on the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA),\nand the measurements are of the slant column rather than the\nvertical column. Because there is no single path of scattered\nlight, the effective slant path length through the atmosphere\nmust be calculated via radiative transfer code. The ratio of\nthis slant path length to the vertical is known as the Air Mass\nFactor (AMF), equal to about 2 at SZA 60\u25e6 and about 18 at\n90\u25e6, but AMF also depends on the wavelength, and on the\nvertical profiles of air density and NO2.\nThe observed spectrum also contains Fraunhofer lines\nfrom the atmosphere of the sun, which would interfere with\nNO2 absorption lines, but because these do not vary with\nSZA the observed spectra can be divided by a reference spec-\ntrum obtained at a small SZA to remove them. This refer-\nence spectrum also contains a small slant amount of NO2\nwhich by this division becomes subtracted from the actual\nslant amounts in the observed spectra.\nHowever there can be significant errors in this method.\nThe spectra are recorded by a solid-state detector with pix-\nels, and because the temperature of the instrument is not con-\ntrolled it expands and contracts moving the pixels along the\nspectrum. Due to this wavelength shift each recorded spec-\ntrum needs to be interpolated before it can be divided by the\nreference spectrum. Some interpolation methods cause the\nnarrow Fraunhofer lines to be smoothed and so broadened,\nhence dividing these broadened lines by the narrower lines in\nthe reference spectrum might create artefacts in the recorded\nspectra that can interfere with the measurement of the NO2\nabsorption lines (Roscoe et al., 1996). Hence the amount of\nNO2 in the reference spectrum might appear to change with\nthe wavelength shift, being a minimum at shifts of 0 or 1 pix-\nels and a maximum at shifts of \u22120.5 or 0.5. Any smoothing\neffect, and so artefact, is larger if there are fewer pixels within\nthe slit width of the spectrometer.\n3 Langley plots and their chemical modification\nOne way of treating the artefact due to wavelength shifts is\nvia Langley plots. On a Langley plot the slant measurements\nof NO2 are plotted against the associated AMFs to obtain a\nstraight line, the gradient of which gives the vertical column\nand the intercept gives the negative of the actual amount of\nNO2 in the reference spectrum plus the artefact (this sum is\noften called the effective amount in the reference spectrum).\nTo get a useful Langley plot with a large range of AMF at\nleast a half-day of data should be plotted.\nLangley plots work well for trace gases which change only\nslowly during the day such as ozone, but the amount of NO2\nvaries significantly during the day due to the interchange of\nNO2 with NO and with reservoir gases such as N2O5. NO2\nreduces quickly at dawn when it is photolysed to NO, then\nincreases quickly at dusk as NO falls almost to zero, while\nNO2 also increases slowly during the day as N2O5 is pho-\ntolysed and reduces slowly during the night as N2O5 is re-\nformed (e.g. Roscoe et al., 1981).\nHence normal Langley plots cannot be used to accurately\ndetermine the vertical column of NO2, instead we must use\nLangley plots with chemically modified AMFs, AMFs that\nhave been multiplied by the ratio of the NO2 vertical column\nat that time of day to the NO2 vertical column at sunset (Lee\net al., 1994), where the NO2 is calculated by a model. In\nthe chemically modified Langley plot all of the data points\nshould now lie in a straight line. The intercept from the mod-\nified plot is then used with the slant measurements and un-\nmodified AMFs to calculate the NO2 vertical column at twi-\nlight (see below). This method allows Langley plots to be\nused to improve the accuracy of NO2 vertical columns, and\nhas been used to provide an improved analysis of NO2 mea-\nsurements between 1990 and 1995 at Faraday (Roscoe et al.,\n2001).\n4 The chemical modification scheme and daily analysis\nIn order to use this method the variation in NO2 during the\ncourse of the day needs to be known for different times of\nAtmos.

Hence an atmospheric photochemical box model is\nused to simulate it.\nWe use a variety of models and programs in the scheme,\nmany of which are described by Denis et al. (2005). A pho-\ntochemical box model is run as 24 stacked boxes to provide\nthe profile through the atmosphere, and includes many differ-\nent chemical species, gas phase reactions, photochemical re-\nactions and heterogeneous chemical reactions (Chipperfield,\n1999), with the amount of aerosol determined by the amount\nof H2SO4.\nThe box model was run for the climatological atmosphere\nover Faraday and then over Rothera, for 12 individual days\nin the year at about one month intervals to include both mid-\nwinter and midsummer (day numbers 21, 51, 81, 111, 141,\n172, 202, 233, 264, 294, 325 and 355), each with a 10 day\nspin-up at constant day number. The climatology of air pres-\nsures, temperatures, and mixing ratios of different chemical\nspecies for the start of the runs were provided from a run\nof the Cambridge 2-D model, as used by some runs of the\nSLIMCAT atmospheric chemical transport model (Chipper-\nfield, 1999), interpolated to the required latitude.\nThe radiative transfer model examines the different paths\nof scattered sunlight through the atmosphere to the spectrom-\neter, using the profiles of NO2 and ozone from the box model,\nto calculate the AMFs for NO2 for a range of SZA during\nthe course of each day. Aerosols are not included in this\nmodel. For each SZA the model considers multiple light\npaths through the atmosphere to the zenith sky spectrome-\nter, which are either single scattered or double scattered, and\nadds up the transmitted light from each path after absorption\nby a given column of NO2. The ratio of this result to the re-\nsult with no NO2 column then gives the AMF (Sarkissian et\nal., 1995).\nAt large SZA the scattered sunlight follows a long slant\npath through the atmosphere from the sun. Because of the\ncurvature of the Earth, the SZA at each location along the\npath is less than the SZA directly above the spectrometer. By\ncalculating the SZA at each location in the radiative trans-\nfer model, we can determine the mass-weighted mean SZA\nat each altitude, for use in the chemical box model. At a\nspectrometer SZA 89\u25e6 the mass-weighted mean SZA over\nall altitudes is 88\u25e6.\nFinally a program calculates the NO2 vertical column at\ntwilight (87\u25e6 to 92\u25e6 SZA), producing both dawn and dusk\nvalues for each day where measurements were obtained, by\nreading files containing one year of slant measurements, each\nwith the day and time, SZA, detector temperature, wave-\nlength shift, and the measurement error. It uses the NO2\nchemical ratios and AMFs from the models to produce mod-\nified Langley plots for each day.\nEach AMF and chemical ratio (NO2 vertical column rela-\ntive to the sunset vertical column) used in the Langley plots is\ncalculated by 2-D linear interpolation of the model results ac-\ncording to the SZA and the day number. On each plot a best-\nfit straight line with error is calculated by weighted least-\nsquares fitting to obtain the intercept and error. A weighted\nmean of all these intercepts over the whole year of data is\ncalculated. For each slant measurement around twilight an\nNO2 vertical column is calculated using the mean intercept\nand the unmodified AMF (Eq. 1), and weighted mean verti-\ncal columns are calculated for both dawn and dusk on each\nday.\nVertical column = Slant column \u2212 mean intercept\nAMF\n(1)\nNO2 vertical columns at dawn and dusk were obtained for\nalmost every day over the period 1990\u20132007, using in Eq. (1)\nthe weighted mean of the modified Langley plot intercepts\nbetween 1 January and 31 December of the relevant year.\nThe resulting vertical columns at midsummer are exam-\nined in more detail by taking the weighted mean of the dawn\nand dusk columns from days 350\u2013360 (16 to 26 December).\nOne problem when assessing the midsummer trends is that\nthe mean SZA of the twilight measurements varies, and the\nNO2 vertical column changes rapidly with SZA at twilight.\nBy using the box model simulation, the measured mean NO2\nvertical columns at dawn and dusk can be used to estimate\nthe value at sunset (or 89\u25e6 in the case of Rothera, where the\nsun never sets in midsummer), and the ratio of NOy\/NO2 at\nsunset in the model can be used to estimate the NOy vertical\ncolumn.\nIt is tempting to use in Eq. (1) the individual intercepts to\ncalculate the vertical columns for each day but for many days\nthe error on the intercept is much too large to do this, particu-\nlarly during winter. An alternative is to use estimates for the\nintercept calculated from the wavelength shift for each day.\nIn principle this could be more accurate since the wavelength\nshift varies over the course of the year due to thermal expan-\nsion and contraction within the spectrometer, and we expect\nthe intercepts of the modified Langley plots to reflect these\nvariations. Using all the data the intercepts from the modi-\nfied Langley plots were plotted against the wavelength shifts,\nthe resulting relationship was used to provide daily intercepts\nfrom the wavelength shift, and the above calculations of mid-\nsummer NO2 and NOy repeated.\nIn the calculation of NOy, partitioning of nitrogen species\nwill depend on temperature, the amount of ozone (which af-\nfects both the amount of UV light and the gas phase chem-\nistry) and the amount of aerosols, so we examined the sensi-\ntivity of NO2 diurnal variations and NOy\/NO2 ratios to these\nquantities.\nProfiles of temperature and ozone were obtained from\nECMWF, using ERA-40 until 2002, then ECMWF-\nOperational data, each at 1\u25e6 resolution and 6-hourly inter-\nvals, courtesy BADC. The box model was run with these pro-\nfiles for midsummer to provide more accurate NO2 vertical\ncolumns, diurnal variations and NOy\/NO2 ratios. The radia-\ntive transfer model was also re-run using the NO2 and ozone\nprofiles for each year to provide more accurate AMFs.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/3601\/2009\/ Atmos. Chem.

Multiplying\nthe AMFs by the NO2 chemical ratios from the box model\nmoves both the morning and evening values much closer to a\nsingle line, although this line curves down at large values of\nAMF when using SZAs at the spectrometer. Using the mean\nSZAs for the air mass makes the line straighter and the errors\nsmaller.\nThe NO2 vertical columns at twilight produced by the\nanalysis are shown in Fig. 2. The difference between dawn\nand dusk is greatest during autumn and spring due to the large\namounts of N2O5 at these times, and more variation in the\nNO2 vertical columns is seen in spring when the site, near\nthe edge of the polar vortex, alternately observes air from\ninside and outside the vortex. The midsummer and mid-\nwinter values vary from year to year, and the lower values\nof NO2 in December 1991 and all of 1992 are due to the\nMt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1991. The eruption greatly in-\ncreased the amount of aerosols in the stratosphere over the\nfollowing 18 months, leading to increased hydrolysis of both\nBrONO2 and N2O5 to HNO3, which titrates NO2 to HNO3.\nNote that the AMFs in 1991 and 1992 were not changed in\nthis analysis (the error involved is less than 5%, Slusser et\nal., 1997).\nThe Langley plot intercepts are shown in Fig. 3.

We expect a repeating pattern\nwith smallest negative values at shifts of 0 and 1 and largest\nnegative values at shifts of \u22120.5 and 0.5, but here they have\nbeen displaced to 0.1 and 0.6. The reason for this displace-\nment is uncertain, but we speculate that it is related to the\nspectral analysis program searching for minimum residuals,\nalways from negative to positive wavelength shift. To find\nthe most probable relationship the plot was folded about 0.1\nand 0.6 so that all the intercepts lay in the range 0.1 to 0.6,\nand a best-fit straight line with error was calculated by least-\nsquares fitting.\nWe now look in detail at the analysed NO2 vertical\ncolumns in midsummer, to consider any trends in NOy. The\nmidsummer values are the most useful for this because the\nNO2 columns are largest here, and the N2O5 columns small-\nest so there is little sensitivity in the NOy \/ NO2 ratio to\nthe amount of aerosols. Figure 5 shows the midsummer\nNO2 vertical columns, using annual weighted mean inter-\ncepts of Fig. 3, and daily intercepts estimated from the wave-\nlength shift in Fig. 4. Considerable year-to-year variation\nis seen and the values from 1991 and 1992 are low follow-\ning the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The midsummer reduction\nin 1991 (20%) and 1992 is almost entirely due to hydrol-\nysis of BrONO2 (Slusser et al., 1997), which is negligible\nfor the amounts of aerosol observed between large volcanic\neruptions. The pattern of trend and variability is almost iden-\ntical using the two methods of analysis, with all differences\nsmaller than the errors.\nThe typical error bar on a slant column of NO2 at 88\u25e6\nSZA in summer is 3.6%. The typical error in vertical col-\numn on the mean of one twilight in summer is 1.4%, as ex-\npected from a mean derived from 7 to 9 slant-column mea-\nsurements. The typical error in NO2 vertical column from\nan 11-day mean in midsummer is 1%, as shown in Fig. 5 \u2013\nlarger than expected from the error in any one twilight be-\ncause there is some variability in NO2 during 11 days. The\npercentage errors in midsummer-mean NOy are necessarily\nidentical to those in NO2.\nTo check that the year-to-year variations in Fig. 5 are\nnot due to differences in the mean SZA of the measure-\nments, thereby causing a different part of the daily varia-\ntion to be observed, the midsummer columns were interpo-\nlated to 89\u25e6 using the daily variation from the box model.\nThe interpolated columns (not shown) coincide very well,\nthe mean difference is only \u22120.01\u00d71015 molec\/cm2, where\nthe dusk and dawn columns have a mean difference of\n0.09\u00d71015 molec\/cm2. This coincidence gives support to the\naccuracy of the box model simulations. Much the same pat-\ntern of trend and variability to that in Fig. 5 is seen, with a\nbroad maximum near 2000. This pattern could be construed\nas an upwards trend in the NO2 vertical columns between\n1990 and 2000 (excluding 1991 and 1992), and a downwards\ntrend after 2000, in which case the gradients of the best-fit\nlines are given in Table 1. Using wavelength shift inter-\ncepts rather than annual mean intercepts again produces a\nvery similar pattern and any differences in the possible trends\n(Table 1) are not significant.\nVariations in the NO2 vertical column do not necessarily\nfollow variations in NOy since the partitioning of nitrogen\nspecies depends on a number of factors, including tempera-\nture, ozone and aerosols. The box model was used to inves-\ntigate the sensitivity of the midsummer NO2 vertical column\nand NOy\/NO2 ratio to these three factors.\nFigure 6a shows the sensitivity of the model NO2 vertical\ncolumn to temperature. Increasing stratospheric temperature\nincreases NO2 while reducing the diurnal variation, but the\nsensitivity to realistic changes is modest at 0.5% K\u22121.\nFigure 6b shows the sensitivity to ozone. Changing the\nozone column will change the amount of UV light reaching\ndifferent levels of the atmosphere and will also affect the gas\nphase chemistry. Increasing the ozone reduces the NO2 at\nthe same altitude, due to the interaction quantified in Eq. (2)\n(Roscoe et al., 2001), but has little effect on the overall NO2\ncolumn (0.05% for a 1% change in ozone) because of the\ncompensating effect of reducing sunlight below, thereby in-\ncreasing NO2 below.\n[NO]\/[NO2] = K(JNO2) exp(1200\/T)\/[O3] (2)\nFigure 6c shows the sensitivity to aerosols, which is set in\nthe box model by changing H2SO4. Increasing the aerosols\nslightly reduces the NO2 column as more HNO3 is pro-\nduced, but the effect is small in midsummer at 0.28% for\na 10% change in aerosol. Figure 6d shows the sensitivity\nof the NOy\/NO2 ratio to temperature, and the ratio is seen\nto fall with increasing temperature. Using the temperature,\nozone and aerosols in the climatology the box model gives\na NOy\/NO2 ratio of 3.8 at 89\u25e6 SZA in midsummer, with the\nsystematic errors listed in Table 2.\nAtmos. Chem.

Hence to better estimate trends in\nNO2 and NOy, actual rather than climatological temperature\nand ozone profiles are needed for each year at midsummer.\nECMWF analyses provided temperature and ozone profiles\nover Faraday and Rothera. The box model was run with these\nprofiles, and the radiative transfer model run with the result-\ning NO2 and ozone profiles. The box model results for mid-\nsummer using the observed and climatological profiles are\ncontrasted in Fig. 7. The NO2 daily variations are very sim-\nilar, though the vertical column is greater with the observed\nprofiles by 0.8% on average and by 2.2% at twilight (87\u25e6 to\n89\u25e6).\nFigure 8 shows the midsummer dawn and dusk columns\ninterpolated to 89\u25e6, using the observed profiles and the cli-\nmatology.

The dependence of the slant columns of\nNO2 on the temperature of the cross sections used, over our\nwavelength range, is 4% for 20 K, or 0.2%\/K. The tempera-\ntures at 70 and 50 hPa in the ECMWF data that we used for\nNOy calculation have standard deviations of 2.6 and 1.7 K,\nand trends of +0.6 and \u22120.6 K\/decade, respectively. These\ntranslate to trends in NO2 due to using a single temperature\nfor cross-sections of +0.12%\/decade and \u22120.12%\/decade,\nsmall compared to total errors listed in Tables 2 and 3. The\naverage trend from 100 hPa to 20 hPa is \u22120.14 K\/decade,\nequivalent to 0.03%\/decade, completely negligible.\nFigure 9 shows the midsummer NOy vertical columns us-\ning the observed profiles and the climatology. The NOy\ncolumns are reduced when using the observed profiles, but\notherwise the trends and variability are very similar. The gra-\ndients of the NOy best-fit lines are given in Table 3.\nHence using observed profiles of temperature and ozone\ninstead of the climatology makes little difference to the NO2\nvalues and the daily variation from the box model, but makes\na significant difference to the NOy values. However the pat-\nterns of trend and variability are almost identical irrespective\nof the method of analysis and irrespective of NO2 or NOy.\n 23\n \n \n \nFig. 8.

By creating chemically\nmodified Langley plots, more accurate vertical columns can\nbe calculated, and by using the daily variation of NO2 and\nthe ratio of NOy\/NO2 in the box model the vertical columns\nof NOy can be estimated.\nThe reduction in the NO2 vertical columns in 1991 and\n1992, due to increased hydrolysis of BrONO2 and N2O5 on\nthe aerosols from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, are clearly seen\n(Slusser et al., 1997). These years are excluded from further\ndiscussion of trends and variability.\nAtmos. Chem.

Earlier studies at 45\u25e6 S have identified an increasing\ntrend in NO2 of about 5%\/decade between 1980 and 1998\n(Liley et al., 2000). If our measurements from 1990 to 2000\nare taken as part of the same trend, our result is much larger\nat about 13%\/decade. This suggests that a pair of opposing\ntrends may not be a useful way of thinking about the ob-\nserved pattern.\nA better viewpoint could be that the changes in NOy\nmostly consist of inter-annual variability, much of it at sub-\ndecadal scales but some with longer periods. From this view-\npoint, the two sets of results could be consistent, because\nof the large NO2 amounts observed in the early 1980s by\nLiley et al. (2000), plus our large maximum in NO2 and\nNOy in 2000. Other researchers studying the tropical lower\nstratosphere have also found implied changes in the Brewer-\nDobson circulation and anomalies around 2000 that are cor-\nrelated with atmospheric dynamics. Randel et al. (2006) cal-\nculated the mean tropical upwelling from the momentum bal-\nance in the atmosphere, finding that this decreased during the\n1990s but has increased since 2000, and that both temper-\nature and ozone above the tropical tropopause increased at\nmany longitudes during 1999\u20132001 which are most proba-\nbly due to changes in the mean tropical upwelling.

(2006) found that the results from\ngeneral circulation models implied that the El Nino Southern\nOscillation (ENSO) signal propagates into the middle atmo-\nsphere by means of planetary scale Rossby waves, so that\nvertical wave propagation is enhanced during El Nino events\nbut reduced during La Nina. Zeng and Pyle (2005) found that\nstratosphere\/troposphere exchange increases during El Nino\nevents, but decreases during La Nina. These two results sug-\ngest that the speed of the Brewer-Dobson circulation depends\non ENSO, with a faster circulation during El Nino years.\nTo investigate the influence of ENSO and QBO on our re-\nsults, plus the possible decadal influence of the solar cycle,\nwe performed multiple regressions on the midsummer val-\nues of the mean of the dawn and dusk NO2 at sunset\/sunrise\n(Fig. 8a) and the similar mean of NOy (Fig. 9a). We used\nthe December (midsummer) monthly means of the following\nregression indices:\n(a) for ENSO, the 3-month running mean of sea-\nsurface temperature anomalies from 5\u25e6 N to 5\u25e6 S and\n120 to 170\u25e6 W (http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov\/products\/\nanalysis monitoring\/ensostuff\/ensoyears.shtml)\n(b) for QBO, the zonal wind over Singapore at 40 hPa\n(B.

ENSO is less well correlated although\nit is still significant at the 90% level. The reconstruction\ncomponents from the regression results for NOy, shown in\nFig. 10, shows that the maximum in NOy in December 2000\nis close to the solar maximum in 2001\/2, and coincides with\na strong negative QBO in December 2000. But although the\nregression accounts for 37% of the variance, much is unac-\ncounted for. In particular, the residuals show that much of the\nincrease up to 2000 and the reduction since is unexplained.\nThis remains partially true even if the solar and QBO slopes\nare pushed to the limits of their error bars \u2013 the reconstructed\nvalue in 1990 then agrees, and the slope to 2000 almost dis-\nappears, but the slope since 2000 is almost doubled.\nImportantly, the linear term from these regressions gives\na much more rigorous trend estimate than a simple straight-\nline fit to the data. This is because dependence on slowly-\nvarying quantities such as the solar cycle can impart a false\ntrend that varies with start and end time of the data set. The\nresults still show little or no overall trend, that in NOy being\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 9, 3601\u20133612, 2009 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/9\/3601\/2009\/\nP. A. Cook and H. K. Roscoe: Variability and trends in stratospheric NO2 3611\n1.1\u00b13.5%\/decade. Including the total systematic error in Ta-\nble 2 would increase this error bar by less than 0.1%\/decade.\nTo investigate the relationship between trends in NOy and\ntrends in speed of the Brewer Dobson circulation, we con-\nstructed a simple multi-box model of the coupled troposphere\nand stratosphere (Cook and Roscoe, 2009). The results show\nthat the trends are of opposite sign, and after subtracting the\ntrend in tropospheric N2O they are of almost equal magni-\ntude (e.g. a 40% increase in speed results in a 39% decrease\nin NOy). Tropospheric N2O has been increasing by about\n2.5%\/decade (WMO 2007), so that our trend in NOy signi-\nfies a small and not significant increase in Brewer-Dobson\ncirculation of 1.4\u00b13.5%\/decade. The correlations with solar\ncycle and QBO in Table 4 imply equal correlations of oppo-\nsite sign in Brewer-Dobson circulation: the speed of circu-\nlation follows the solar cycle with amplitude of about 20%,\nbeing slowest at solar maximum; and follows the QBO with\namplitude of about 10%, being fastest at the positive phase of\nthe QBO. There remains an unexplained cycle of amplitude\nat least 15% and of period at least 17 years, with a minimum\nin speed in about 2000.\nAcknowledgements.
