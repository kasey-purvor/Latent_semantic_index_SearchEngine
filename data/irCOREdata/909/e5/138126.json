Introduction \nInvestment in capacity expansion remains one of the most critical decisions for a \nmanufacturing organisation with global production facilities. In the late 1970s, \nWheelwright (1978) put forward the notion that aggregate capacity was one of the five \nstrategic manufacturing decision areas and so a key part of a company\u2019s operations \nstrategy. As Rudberg and Olhager (2003) reported, this view is widely supported (e.g. \nby Porter, 1980; Fine and Hax, 1985; Hill, 1989; Samson, 1991; Miltenburg, 1995; \nSlack et al., 1995; and Skinner, 1996). The capacity expansion decision can vary in \nform, for example, it can be in a policy based on an infinite time horizon or a one-off \nexpansion step based on a single period (Luss, 1982). The decision can specify the \ntiming of expansion, the size of expansion, the product impacted and the production \nlocation. Similarly, the various factors affecting this decision can include the global \nmanufacturing strategy of the firm, the prevailing and future forecasted market \nconditions and the competitive strengths of the various factories and locations. The \ncombination of these factors makes each capacity expansion decision in a \nmanufacturing network different and complex and hence no single solution exists.  \nSince the early 1960s, many quantitative studies of capacity expansion problems have \nbeen conducted. Manne (1961) provides the first and simplest models of capacity \nexpansion with deterministic demand, single facility and infinite economic life. His \nbook (Manne, 1967a) provides a description of various capacity expansion problems in \nwhich optimal location for each expansion is considered explicitly (Erlenkotter, 1967; \nManne, 1967b). By the early 1980s, the capacity expansion literature evolved to include \nmultiple issues and consider multiple facilities in the decision-making process. Luss \n  3\n(1982) points out that the typical objective was to minimise the discounted costs \nassociated with the expansion process. Porter (1980), however, argued that the capacity \nexpansion problem is not as simple as just carrying out such analysis based on a few \nfactors. Estimating the factors that influence a capacity expansion is a subtle problem in \nindustry.  \nMost of the recent work in the area of capacity expansion decision processes has \nfocused on the advancement of computational techniques (Syam, 2000) to solve \ndifferent aspects of the problem based on different constraints and objectives. Some \nwork has been carried out investigating soft factors (O'Brien and Smith, 1993; \nMeijboom and Voordijk, 2003) yet no complete process has been put forward. Thus the \nchallenge is to develop a decision process that can capture leading thinking in the area \nand to expand this to include soft issues in capacity expansion in global manufacturing \nnetworks. This paper therefore aims to establish the state of current research in multiple \nfactor models for capacity expansion in manufacturing plants. This is carried out \nthrough a structured literature review of the key contributions against factors that are \nessential to the holistic consideration of the capacity expansion problem.  \nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes in detail the industrial problem of \ncapacity expansion in global manufacturing networks and leads to the development of a \nthree phase research programme described in Section 3. The first phase identifies the \nrelevant research in this area (Section 4), followed by the development of a \ncomprehensive list of factors and detailed analysis of relevant literature (Section 5). The \nthird phase comprises a structured analysis of the findings of the research (Section 6). \nThis paper concludes with the identification of gaps and opportunities for future \nresearch. \n  4\n2. Background \nThis section discusses the industrial challenge, defines the term \u2018multi-factor models for \ncapacity expansion\u2019 and explores the reasons and motives for capacity expansion in \nmanufacturing networks. Existing methods and models that can be used to address \ncapacity expansion problems are also introduced in this section. \n2.1 The industrial challenge \nThe industrial challenge stems from the discussions with manufacturing companies in \nSingapore who have multiple plants across the region. The market for their products is \nincreasing rapidly and, with all factories currently producing close to their maximum \ncapacities, there is a need to decide upon the investment (e.g. on facilities, machines, \nmanpower, etc.) for capacity expansion. Such a decision is normally made by \nconsidering the discounted costs associated with the expansion for which a number of \nmodels are available in the literature. However, it was suggested (by company \nmanagements) that soft factors like human resources (availability and skill levels), \nlogistics connectivity and socio-economic factors of the country should also be \nconsidered in the decision. Traditionally, the industrial decision makers use the cost \nminimisation approach and follow it with the soft considerations but this is not \nconsidered the best approach by the company management. The management argued \nthat the accuracy of the models based on cost considerations alone is not as much \ndesired by the practitioners as the ability of a model to consider a number of factors. \nThis premise has formed the basis of the work described in this paper.  \n  5\n2.2 Multi-factor model for capacity expansion in manufacturing networks \nThe definition of \u2018multi-factor model for capacity expansion in manufacturing \nnetworks\u2019 is best approached by considering the associated concepts individually. \nCapacity is defined in a number of ways by different authors. Slack et al. (1995) define \ncapacity of an operation as the maximum level of value-added activity over a period of \ntime. Alternatively, capacity is often referred to as the throughput or output capacity in \nterms of the number of units produced by a resource in unit time (Buffa, 1983). As a \nmanufacturing network is a set of plants producing similar goods, \u2018capacity of the \nmanufacturing network\u2019 can be considered to be the sum of capacities of the individual \nplants. Hence, \u2018capacity expansion in a manufacturing network\u2019 implies addition of \ncapacity to the network. Finally, any decision process can be considered to be a \u2018multi-\nfactor model\u2019 if it takes into account a variety of factors as inputs and provides a set of \ndecision factors as output.  \nFigure 1 illustrates a typical multi-factor model for capacity expansion in manufacturing \nnetworks. The decision process takes in different costs, demands, investment budget, \nsocio-economic factors and the manufacturing strategy of a company as inputs and \ngenerates the amount of capacity to be expanded in each plant, respective production \nvolumes and investment required as outputs.  \nInsert Figure 1 here \n2.3 Plant configurations in global manufacturing networks \nGlobal manufacturing networks can take up a variety of configurations. Chakravarty \n(2005) suggests two extremes. First, a plant in each country serving its local market \n(Figure 2a) and, second, a single centralised plant which exports to all countries (Figure \n2b). Most global manufacturing networks operate somewhere between the above two \n  6\nextreme configurations (Figure 2c). For example, Kanter (1995) uses this to explain \nGillette\u2019s operations. She reported that 70% of the $6 billion annual sales are outside the \nUS through 58 plants in 28 countries serving markets in 200 countries. As production in \nplants in a manufacturing network reach their maximum capacities, the need to decide \nupon the investment for capacity expansion also arises. The capacity expansion decision \nthen becomes critical.  \nInsert Figure 2 here \n2.4 Previous research on capacity expansion in manufacturing plants \nThe first studies in capacity changes aimed for an optimal utilisation model of capital \n(Marris, 1964). These static capacity situations had two basic assumptions. First was \nthat the demand was constant over the life of the plant. The second assumption was that \nthe total capacity is embodied in a single plant. This model was followed by a dynamic \ncapacity model in which the demand increased with time and the future pattern was \nknown with certainty (assumed to be linear in most cases). Manne (1967a) modelled \nthis capacity expansion in a series of heavy process industries in India.  \nManne (1967b) followed his previous work with an integer programming formulation \nfor capacity expansion across two facilities. Erlenkotter (1967) developed a dynamic \nprogramming formulation of the same problem with fewer restrictions. This was \nfollowed by further improvements in later years by himself (Erlenkotter, 1972; \nErlenkotter, 1974) and Freidenfelds (1981). The work in this field has since expanded to \ninclude a number of different issues.  \nDixit (1980) discussed the effect of capacity expansion decision on entry-deterrence in \nan industry. Using game theoretic models he explained a number of capacity expansion \n  7\nscenarios in an industry with multiple players. This concept has since been extended by \nvarious authors in the field of Industrial Organisation (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). \nApplication of these concepts in U.S. firms is discussed by Bulan (2005), however the \nscope of the above works is limited to capital budgeting decisions and does not take into \naccount any other issue in capacity expansion. \nLuss (1982) provides the latest comprehensive review of capacity expansion literature \n(van Meighem, 2003) and identifies various research issues (Table 1). Since then, \nimportant work has been carried out by many researchers including Reeves et. al \n(1988), Li and Tirupati (1994), Syam (2000), Perrone et. al (2002), Ryan (2004), \nChakravarty (1999; 2005) and Bish and Hong (2006). They have all been addressing \nissues identified by Luss (1982) as well as extending them. The need now is to provide \nan updated review of this work, so a proper assessment can be made of the current \nsituation. \nInsert Table 1 here \n3. Overview of research programme and methodology \nThe aim of the research described in this paper is to provide a contemporary review of \nresearch in multi-factor models for capacity expansion and so identify opportunities for \nfuture work. To achieve this, the following research objectives have been to: \n1. Identify literature relevant to the issues of capacity expansion. \n2. Form a review of the factors considered as inputs and outputs, along with the \nunderlying assumption and solution methodologies. \n  8\n3. Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the work and identify the opportunities \nfor further research. \nThese objectives naturally lead to a three-phase research programme. Phase 1 consisted \nof a structured search through databases to identify relevant literature and to filter the \nresults based on the definition of capacity expansion in manufacturing networks. Phase \n2 generated a comprehensive categorisation of factors based on a detailed review of \nresearch. Gaps in the work are identified in Phase 3 and subsequently, a SWOT \n(Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis has been used to structure \nthe investigation. Execution of Phases 1, 2 and 3 are described in detail in Sections 4, 5 \nand 6 respectively. \n4. Phase 1: Identification of relevant literature \nThis first phase of research set out to identify the work done in the area of capacity \nexpansion. This was initially carried out through searches executed in research \ndatabases including ABI\/INFORM (Proquest, 2005) and Web of Knowledge (ISI, \n2005). The keywords used were \u2018manufacturing\u2019, \u2018network\u2019, \u2018capacity\u2019, \u2018expansion\u2019 and \n\u2018global\u2019 and their combinations. Searches in ABI\/INFORM were focused on scholarly \npeer-reviewed journals, whereas the Web of Knowledge searches included conference \nproceedings and articles from magazines. The keyword combinations of \n\u2018manufacturing-capacity-expansion\u2019, \u2018capacity-global-expansion\u2019 and \u2018manufacturing-\nglobal-expansion\u2019 yielded the most relevant results. Around 100 papers were identified \nand included in the first cut search results. \nThe set of papers collated from the above search were further refined by taking into \nconsideration the industrial domain. Papers not relevant to manufacturing, for example \n  9\nthose from the sectors of telecommunication networks, power networks, utilities and the \nchemical industry, were eliminated from the set. Relevant papers were then identified \nthrough the title, followed by consideration of the abstract. An additional strategy based \non citation of important work was adopted at this stage. Important works like those by \nManne (1961; 1967a; 1967b) and Luss (1982) were identified and a search of all papers \nciting them was also carried out.  \nRelevant literature identified in Phase 1 was in the overall field of capacity expansion in \nmanufacturing plants. There was a need to further refine this set to select the work that \nproposed multiple factor models rather than to merely address any single issue of the \ncapacity expansion problem. Examples of the latter included research to determine \ninvestment times of capacity expansion under uncertainty (Bean and Smith, 1985; Bean \net al., 1992; Higle and Corrado, 1992; Dangl, 1999; Ahmed et al., 2003), investment in \nflexible production technology (Fine and Freund, 1990; Van Meighem, 1998; Netessine \net al., 2002), machine replacement (Rajagopalan et al., 1998; Chand et al., 2000) and \nrisk (Callen and Sarath, 1995; Birge, 2000; Borgonovo and Peccati, 2004).Through this \nprocess, eleven multi-factor models were identified based upon eleven papers listed in \nTable 2. \n5. Phase 2: Factor analysis \nThe purpose of this phase was to identify the various factors that were put forward as \nimportant within the relevant literature. This was carried out in two steps.  \n5.1 Determination of factors important for capacity expansion \nThe multi-factor models proposed by the authors were considered in terms of inputs, \noutputs, assumptions and techniques. These were assessed by tabulating the contribution \n  10\nof each researcher as presented in Table 2. Once the classification of factors was \ncompleted, cross checking was performed to ensure that all factors indirectly considered \nwere taken into account. \nInsert Table 2 here \n5.2 Detailed analysis of factors \nBased on the classification of relevant literature (Table 2), a more detailed review could \nbe carried out to confirm strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for future work. A \nsummary of this review is provided in this section.  \nReeves et al. (1988) considers capacity expansion of an industrial firm producing \nmultiple products in several economic regions over a multiple period horizon. They \nconsider market demand, capital costs, labour costs and transportation costs and some \nproducts manufactured by some plants are consumed internally by other plants in the \nmanufacturing network. There are maximum limits on transportation capacity, \ninvestment in regional facilities, total capital expenditure and intra regional shipments. \nThey also assume that expected net present values of a unit of capital for each \ncombination of region, time period and capacity expansion in existing or new facilities \nfor production of each product, are available. The decision process, aims to maximise \nreturn on capital invested and maximise total output of a given product and the total \noutput of existing facilities in a particular region, whilst minimising capital invested in \nnew facilities, along with labour, production and transportation costs. They solve this \nmulti-objective problem using the Interactive Sequential Goal Programming (ISGP) \ntechnique proposed by Masud and Hwang (1981). \n  11\nLi and Tirupati (1994) examine a multi-product dynamic investment model for making \ntechnology selections and expansion decisions over a finite planning horizon in a firm \nwith a single production facility. The environment is characterised by a dynamic growth \nin market demand. The objective is to determine the minimal cost schedule for capacity \nadditions to meet the product demands, which are known over the planning horizon. \nThey formulate the problem as a mathematical program and develop a two-phase \napproach using heuristics to solve it.   \nRajagopalan (1998) developed a model that unifies the equipment replacement \nliterature, which generally ignores scale economies; and the capacity expansion \nliterature, which ignores replacement of equipment. This model can also be extended to \naddress issues, such as quantity discounts in purchases, alternative technology selection \nand multiple equipment types.  \nSyam (2000) looks at capacity expansion in international markets and considers \nproduction costs (labour and manufacturing), logistics costs, and present capacity at the \ndifferent plants. The capacity of the plant can achieve three discrete levels and the \ndemand has an increasing or decreasing trend. Syam (2000) also explores the cost-\nbenefit-risk for various expansion scenarios and argues that even when cost premiums \nare significant, the managers need to weigh them against the potential political benefits \nand risk factors when making expansion decisions. \nRajagopalan and Swaminathan (2001) argue that inventory management policies have \nconsiderable effects on capacity expansion decisions especially in cases where demand \nis growing rapidly and the firm periodically needs to add machine capacity. They \ndevelop a mathematical programming model as an effective solution approach to \n  12\ndetermine the optimal capacity expansion, production and inventory decisions over \ntime. They study the trade-off between using excess capacity to build inventory and \nhence postpone future capacity acquisition to using the excess capacity to increase \nchangeovers and reduce lot sizes. Their work is motivated by their interactions with a \nlarge firm in the consumer products industry.   \nHsu (2002) addresses a capacity expansion problem allowing incremental demand to \nremain unsatisfied by in-house capacity and use temporary capacity such as leasing or \noutsourcing. Such a decision is preferred especially in the case of a speculative motive \ne.g. a firm may delay acquisition of certain technology, which is expected to be cheaper \nin the near future. The objective of his model is to minimise the total acquisition, \nholding and operating costs associated with all capacity expansion incurred in a multi-\nperiod planning horizon. \nPerrone et al. (2002) also examine capacity expansion in the presence of both flexible \nand dedicated capacity. They model a firm in a market characterised by uncertain \ndemand where product prices are linearly dependent on its demand. The outputs of the \nmodel are price and production volume of each product in scenarios where either \nflexible or dedicated equipment is used. This is an extension to previous works where \nfully flexible resources are considered (Caulkins and Fine, 1990; Harrison and Van \nMieghem, 1999). They also argue that most of the quantitative models deal with \nspecific and focused problems, neglecting the breadth and complexity of the whole \ncapacity expansion problem. They strengthen the aim of this paper by arguing that the \ndevelopment of an integrated and comprehensive decision-support is a path that should \nbe investigated in deep.  \n  13\nGaimon and Burgess (2003) describe the primary trade-off in capacity expansion as \u201cthe \ntotal cost over all expansions is reduced through a small number of large-sized \nexpansions (economies of scale), whereas the costs associated with deviating from \ndemand are reduced through a large number of small-sized expansions\u201d. They study the \nrelationship between the lead time for capacity expansion and the size of the expansion \nand also investigate the effects of learning from prior design and implementation on this \nlead time. They show that a lead time reduction generates benefits, which may exceed \nthe cost savings from economies of scale. A firm thus is able to invest optimally in a \nlarger number of smaller-sized expansions.  \nRyan (2004) emphasises the risk of capacity shortages during lead time for adding \ncapacity in environments with demand uncertainty and an obligation to provide a \nspecified level of service. She shows that expansion is needed even in the presence of \nexcess capacity to make up for a growing demand. Also in cases of high uncertainty in \ndemand, larger expansion sizes are necessary, but the main impact is still to provoke \nearlier installations. Even though the domain of the model is not manufacturing \nindustry, the implications of lead time on capacity expansion in a manufacturing \nnetwork are obvious. Further, Ryan (2004) develops the model using the financial \noption pricing concept which has been proven by researchers to provide a more accurate \nevaluation of investment projects with strategic interactions (Miller and Park, 2002). \nBulan (2005) provides substantial evidence of the relationship between investment \navailable with a firm for expansion purposes and the uncertainty in its environment \nusing the real options approach. Similar real option approaches for investment decisions \nrelated to capacity expansion have been proposed by Feinstein and Lander (2002), \nKarsak and Ozogul (2002) and Amico et al. (2003).  \n  14\nChakravarty (2005) proposes a model to optimise plant investment decisions for \ncapacity expansion while ensuring that the plant investment overhead is optimally \nabsorbed by products produced from that plant. The model considers the effect of labour \ncost, transportation cost, demand and import tariff on production quantities, investment \nand overhead absorption pattern. The concept of productivity differences between \ncountries is modelled and the result is a profile of investment allocation to different \nplants with a fixed total investment budget.  \nMelo et al. (2005) propose a mathematical modelling framework to address many \npractical aspects of manufacturing network design simultaneously. These include \ndynamic planning horizon, distribution, supply of materials, inventory, facility \nconfigurations, availability of capital for investments and storage limitations. They \naddress strategic issues of relocation of capacity, capacity additions in present and new \nfacilities and link the issue of capacity expansion to overall supply chain strategy of a \nfirm. Details of their model can be found in Melo et al. (2003). \n6. Phase 3: Analysis and discussion \nThe purpose of this phase is to provide a structured appraisal of the results from Phase \n2. \n6.1 Strengths of current research \nThere are eleven papers (see Table 2) which were identified as relevant work that \naddresses multiple factors. Collectively, they comprehensively consider almost all the \ncurrent issues foreseen in the capacity expansion problem. Four factors appear to be the \nmost important ones as most of the authors considered them as inputs to their models.  \n  15\nFirst, product demand was a factor considered by all the authors in one form or another. \nChakravarty (2005) incorporated demand as a function of price, based on the concept of \ndemand curves. Rajagopalan and Swaminathan (2001), Hsu (2002), and Gaimon and \nBurgess (2003) consider unsatisfied (residual) demand as an input whereas all other \nauthors considered overall demand as an input. Rajagopalan (1998), Perrone et al. \n(2002) and Ryan (2004) also consider uncertainty in the product demand.  \nSecond factor considered important by nine authors is the cost of investment for the \nrequired capacity expansion. Reeves (1988) considered expected net present value as an \ninput whereas Hsu (2002) incorporated the capital requirement per unit of output as an \ninput. Except for Syam (2000) and Ryan (2004), all other authors used a standard \ninvestment cost function. Rajagopalan (1998) also considers the cost of replacement of \nexisting resources and exhibits how the capacity expansion model can be extended to \ninclude concepts of alternative technologies, multiple demand types and quantity \ndiscounts.  \nThirdly, all authors considered production costs in their models. These costs are \ncategorised as labour, production and transportation costs. Perrone et al. (2002), \nChakravarty (2005) and Melo et al. (2005) explicitly consider consider variable cost of \nproduction whereas four other authors consider this variable cost indirectly. Most \nauthors consider operating cost function based on a dedicated technology barring \nReeves et al. (1988), Li and Tirupati (1994) and Perrone et al. (2002) who include \noperating cost functions for both dedicated and flexible technologies. Finally, initial \ncapacity is a factor identified as important by the analysis of Table 2. Nine out of eleven \nof the authors considered it as an input with Li and Tirupati (1994) considering both \ndedicated and flexible capacity. \n  16\nWith regards to the techniques used by the authors, seven out of the eleven authors \nemployed some form of mathematical programming. They rigorously developed best \nsolution approaches for the proposed models and thus provided close to optimal results. \nPerrone et al. (2002), Gaimon and Burgess (2003), Ryan (2004) and Chakravarty (2005) \nused theoretical modelling techniques to solve the capacity expansion problem with \nRyan (2004) including the concepts of financial option pricing in her model. Some work \nalso enhanced the quality of decision support provided by integrating the detailed risk \nanalysis (Syam, 2000) and the sensitivity analysis (Chakravarty, 2005).   \nIn summary, four factors are considered important by almost all the authors. These are \nproduct demand, cost of investment, production costs and initial capacity. Most of the \nauthors have also developed comprehensive solution techniques. The techniques are \nrigorous in nature and are primarily mathematical models which provide close to \noptimal results. Some authors have enhanced the quality of decision by additional \ntechniques of risk diversification and sensitivity analysis. \n6.2 Weaknesses of current research \nThe primary shortcoming of the current state of literature is the lack of any \ncomprehensive multi-factor model based on all the inputs identified. Work by Reeves \n(1988), Chakravarty (2005) and Melo et al. (2005) are closest to being holistic models \nas they consider the maximum number of identified factors as input to their multi-factor \nmodels. \nEconomic factors like market size in the country, currency exchange rates and local \ntaxes are incorporated primarily by Chakravarty (2005), who also includes the concept \nof overhead allocation to individual factories based on their share of the investment \n  17\nbudget. Syam (2000) incorporates risk diversification in his model whereas Hsu (2002), \nand Gaimon and Burgess (2003) take into account penalty from capacity shortages. \nOnly Gaimon and Burgess (2003) and Ryan (2004) take into account lead time for \ncapacity expansion and the effect of learning on capacity expansion. There are however \na number of papers discussing the effect of each of the above in isolation. These works \nhowever did not qualify as multi-factor models. \nSimilarly, factors like production efficiency which can inherently capture effects of \nworker skills and quality of labour are only considered by Reeves et al. (1988) and \nRajagopalan and Swaminathan (2001). Accounting policies, investment budgets and \nother costs like capacity holding and replacement costs are also not considered by most \nauthors. There is thus no single contribution which incorporates all the identified input \nfactors of the capacity expansion problem. \nFurther, the list of factors although extensive appears incomplete. During the execution \nof Phase 1, some literature on capacity expansion suggested factors, which are not \nvisible in any of the multi-factor models. Gutenberg (1992) provides an industrial view \nof investment for capacity expansion based on a questionnaire survey of the German \nindustry and identified, in decreasing order of importance, factors such as expectation of \nfavourable markets, bottleneck elimination in plants, improvement in running costs, \nmarket share threatened, tax concessions and fearing a further increase in capital goods. \nOlhager, Rudberg and Wikner (2001) research the link between manufacturing strategy \nand capacity expansion decisions, however, none of the identified multi-factor models \nconsider it.  \n  18\nAn additional weakness is that the solution strategy adopted by most authors is almost \nexclusively mathematical, the emphasis is on costs and the exercise revolves around \nminimising the discounted costs or maximising the returns on investment. There is a \nlack of processes that use a combination of decision techniques to yielding a more \nexpansive analysis of the problem. Similarly, none of the work identified the decision \nmakers (personnel from the organisation) who need to be involved, or provided \ninformation about the time guidelines required for all steps of the decision process, for \nexample, data identification, gathering and analysis. These are crucial for the \nimplementation of any proposed decision process in the industry.  \nFinally, there is an absence of industrial case studies which reflect the efficacy of such \nmodels in industry. Although Ferdows (1997) provides some industrial examples of \ncapacity expansion based on the concept of strategic roles of factories, and Kim and Lee \n(2001) discuss capacity expansion strategies based on lessons from Hyundai and \nDaewoo, their models however are focused more on the strategic level and lack details \nfor implementation. An industrial case of capacity expansion in wafer fabrication \nindustry is presented by Nazzal, Mollaghasemi and Anderson (2006). They provide a \ncomplete decision making process including simulation modelling, design of \nexperiments, statistical analysis and economic justification. However, the input to the \nmodel is cost of buying equipment and the output is net cash flow derived from change \nin cycle times. \nIn summary therefore, there are a number of weaknesses in the current literature. First, \nthere is no model which is holistic enough to handle all the factors deemed important \nfor capacity expansion. Second, there is no description of the sources of data used by \n  19\nthe models from the perspective of the host company. Finally, implementation studies \nare also lacking.   \n6.3 Opportunities from current research \nThe identification of weaknesses of the work provides an important starting point for \nthe opportunities of future work in this area. The first opportunity lies in ratifying the \nlist of factors deemed important for capacity expansion as developed from the literature. \nThis ratification needs to come from the decision makers in industry and can be carried \nout, for example, by conducting semi-structured interviews. Discussion of qualitative \nfactors like political advantages and manufacturing strategies also need to be conducted \nduring this ratification exercise. Relative importance of various factors, from an \nindustrial perspective, will be an important objective of this exercise. \nAnother opportunity identified includes the development of a truly holistic decision \nprocess for capacity expansion in manufacturing networks. The comprehensive list of \nfactors ratified by the industry can form the industrial specification of such a holistic \ndecision process. The process can derive solution strategies from the available literature \nand rely on multiple techniques to provide a more complete analysis of the capacity \nexpansion problem. \nFinally, the opportunity to conduct comprehensive industrial case studies needs to be \nacted upon. Testing of the proposed holistic process by the practitioners, and developing \nan implementation path for the industry are the two main objectives for the case studies. \nThe case studies need to be conducted at different firms to test both the applicability and \nrobustness of any capacity expansion decision making process which claims to be \nholistic in nature. \n  20\n6.4 Threats from\/of current research \nIt was observed that there is also no work based on industrial data comparing the \ndifferent factors and developing a reference list based on importance. There are studies \ncarried out in the related field of facility location (MacCarthy and Atthirawong, 2003; \nBhutta, 2004) but results cannot be directly applied to capacity expansion. The work \nseems to be suffering from the limitation of taking into account quantitative factors like \ncosts, and then applying the softer socio-economic factors on the decisions derived from \nthe quantitative analysis (MacCormack et al., 1994). The threat arises where soft factors \nsupersede the quantitative factors. Taking a stronger stance on this issue, there is no \nevidence that the entire body of work is still industrially relevant. \n6.5 Summary of analysis \nThis analysis is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that the current condition of literature \nin this area has a number of weaknesses which open doors to further research. The main \nfocus of future research should thus be in the development of holistic models and the \nembedding of those models in a decision framework with focus on the users. Industrial \ncase studies will also help strengthen the case for relevance of the work and its utility to \nthe decision-makers in industry. \nInsert Figure 3 here \n7. Concluding remarks \nThe aim of this paper was to establish the current state of research in multi-factor \nmodels for capacity expansion and develop a set of specifications on which any holistic \nand comprehensive model can be created. The capacity expansion problem has been \ndescribed and a three stage research programme executed. This included a systematic \n  21\nsearch in the literature followed by a refinement of the search criteria. A list of factors \nconsidered by academia has been collated and then contrasted. The current state of \nliterature was then reviewed and a SWOT analysis was used to provide a structured \nsummary of the results.  \nAlthough substantial work has been carried out in the development of solution \ntechniques, no model has addressed all the factors considered important to the capacity \nexpansion decision process. The development of a holistic model that is capable of \ntackling the same problem has been identified as an important research opportunity.  \nFuture research including ratification of the comprehensive list of factors by industry, \ndevelopment of a holistic decision process based on the identified factors and industrial \ncase studies which demonstrate both the efficacy and the short comings of such a \nprocess is planned by the authors in the near future. \n  22\nReferences \nAhmed, S., King, A.J., Parija, G., 2003.
