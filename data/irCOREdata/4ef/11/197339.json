The estimated prevalence of UI in general population studies varies from 5% to 69% with most \nestimates between 25% and 45%.  In middle aged and older women daily incontinence estimates vary \nfrom 5% to 15%.[1]  The majority of these women have stress urinary incontinence (SUI), 50%, or mixed \nurinary incontinence (MUI), 36%.[2]  A 2004 UK study estimated the annual cost to the National Health \nService of treating clinically important UI in women at \u00a3233m.[3]\n \nUrodynamic testing is one of several methods that may be used in the assessment of UI to guide \nmanagement decisions, including whether surgical intervention is indicated.  This group of investigations \nis used to evaluate the function of the lower urinary tract and can be invasive (requiring catheterisation) \nor non-invasive.[4]  The most commonly used invasive urodynamic test (IUT) is multi-channel \ncystometry;[5] this looks at the pressure\/volume relationships during bladder filling and emptying, with a \nview to defining a functional, as distinct from symptomatic, diagnosis.  Whilst this is the most commonly \nused IUT, videocystometry and ambulatory bladder pressure monitoring are also used.  Non-invasive tests \ninclude frequency\/volume charting, mid-stream urine culture, urine flow rate and residual urine volume \nmeasurement by ultrasound.[6] \nThe current position of IUT in the diagnostic pathway is not agreed, and practice varies considerably.  In a \nUK survey in 2002 only half of the units surveyed had guidelines on indications for the tests, and 84.5% \ncarried out cystometry in all women with incontinence.[5]  Current guidance from the National Institute \nfor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests that cystometry is not required prior to conservative \ntreatments, and that there is no evidence to support its use prior to surgery where the diagnosis of SUI is \nlikely.[7]  NICE, the National Institute for Health Research \u2013 Health Technology Assessment (NIHR-HTA) \nprogramme, the Cochrane Collaboration and the International Consultations on Incontinence (ICI) have all \nrecently undertaken systematic reviews on the subject of urodynamic testing, and all emphasize the lack \nof high quality primary research confirming clinical utility.[4, 7-10]\n \n Patients and clinicians working \ntogether in a project associated with the James Lind Alliance (JLA) have identified IUT as a research \npriority and, along with NICE, have recommended further research to answer the question of whether the \nuse of IUT, prior to initial or subsequent treatments, affects the outcomes and cost effectiveness of \ninterventions in women with UI.[7, 10]\n \nThe costing report associated with the NICE clinical guideline on UI used an estimated charge of \u00a3176 for \neach IUT.  Consequently, the annual potential saving from eliminating IUT prior to conservative treatment \nwas estimated at approximately \u00a33m and savings from a more rational use of IUT before surgery for SUI at \napproximately \u00a3321,000.[7]\n \n These calculations are based on 2002 -2007 figures.  Changes in available \noperative techniques have led to dramatic alterations in surgical practice as recorded in the NHS\u2019s \nHospital Episode Statistics (HES) which showed a 54% increase in surgery for SUI over the last ten \nyears.[11]  These data along with 2008-09 national tariff costs for IUT of \u00a3425 suggest that the savings \nfrom a more rational use of IUT prior to surgery are likely to be substantially greater. \nA randomised controlled trial (RCT) of IUT versus less invasive procedures prior to surgery would provide \ngold-standard evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this expensive procedure.  However, prior \nto proceeding to a full scale RCT, a feasibility pilot study is deemed necessary for several reasons; \nThe use of IUT is widely established in clinical practice; many experts consider it a mandatory \ninvestigation, particularly prior to surgery.[12, 13]\n  \nSo we need to establish whether sufficient clinicians \nare in equipoise and willing to recruit and randomise patients to a RCT.  There is growing evidence in \nfavour of pilot studies involving collection of both quantitative and qualitative data prior to embarking on \nthis type of definitive RCT.[14]\n \n 4\nPatients may not see the importance of \u2018testing a test\u2019 and are usually willing to undergo even invasive \ninvestigations in the belief that they guide their clinician and themselves to the most appropriate \nmanagement.  Trials reported in 2000 and 2001 randomizing radiography investigations for low back pain \nwere only able to recruit 23% and 51% of patients approached to enter the randomised arms.[15, 16]\n  \nBy \nassessing patient\u2019s willingness to undergo randomisation, potential barriers and facilitators to \nparticipation can be identified and used to modify the design of the definitive trial. \nGiven these uncertainties, before carrying out a definitive trial, it is essential to undertake a pilot study to \nestimate the extent of the potential recruitment problems described above and to provide robust \nestimates of the variability of the proposed outcome measures and of the likely rates of eligibility, \nrecruitment, randomisation and retention of participants. \n \nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES \nTHE FUTURE DEFINITIVE TRIAL (INVESTIGATE II) \nThe objective of the proposed future definitive trial is to address the question of whether IUT compared \nto basic clinical assessment (non-invasive) alters treatment decisions and outcomes, including the \nincremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, in women potentially suitable for surgical \ntreatment of SUI or stress predominant MUI.  The outcome measures will include quantified post-\ntreatment urinary leakage, impact on general health and condition-specific quality of life, adverse effects \nfrom investigation or treatment, and health economic outcomes.  The latter will include mean \nincremental cost, mean incremental QALYs, and incremental cost per QALY.  Thus, in the definitive trial, \nwe hope to establish whether IUT should indeed be offered to all women prior to surgery. \n  \nTHE PILOT TRIAL (INVESTIGATE I) \nThe objective of this pilot trial is to test the logistics and feasibility of the definitive trial, specifically; \n\u2022 To carry out an external (rehearsal) pilot trial randomising patients between basic assessment \nand IUT to assess patient recruitment and willingness to be randomised, rehearse methodology, \nand provide outcome data to inform sample size calculations for a definitive trial. \n\u2022 To explore women\u2019s reasons for participation or non-participation and their experiences of the \npilot trial procedures.  Their responses may help not only in the evaluation of the feasibility of the \ndefinitive trial, but also in the planning and optimising of future recruitment and retention. \n\u2022 To assess clinicians\u2019 views on IUT in this particular context and their willingness to randomise \npatients within a definitive trial. \n \nMETHODS\/DESIGN \nTRIAL DESIGN \nThe pilot feasibility study is a mixed methods pragmatic multicentre study[17] with four components, \nconducted over a two year period, as follows:- \n1. A multicentre randomised external pilot trial comparing basic clinical assessment \nand IUT.  The design fully rehearses the research design and outcome measures \nproposed for the definitive RCT.  \n2. Qualitative interviews with a purposely sampled subset of women eligible for the \ntrial to explore their reasons for agreeing (or not) to participate, their willingness \nto be randomised, and their experiences of the pilot trial. \n 5 \n3. A national web-based survey of relevant clinicians' views about urodynamics and \ntheir willingness to enter their patients into the definitive trial; the membership \nlists of the appropriate professional bodies and special interest groups will be \nused as the sampling frame. \n4. Qualitative interviews with a small subset of clinicians (respondents to the \nsurvey) to explore whether and how they use the results of IUT to inform their \ndecisions, and to contextualise the questionnaire responses. \n \nRANDOMISED TRIAL \nPARTICIPANTS \nWomen will be recruited from six UK units which include a mix of specialist urogynaecology (Newcastle \nupon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust & University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust), female urology \n(Morriston Hospital, Swansea & Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield) and general gynaecology (Queen \nElizabeth Hospital, Gateshead & Wansbeck Hospital, Northumberland) departments.  These units provide \nsecondary +\/- tertiary level of care and are representative of the UK units who would be invited to \nparticipate in the definitive trial.  Eligibility criteria for the pilot trial are those anticipated for the future \ndefinitive trial. \nInclusion criteria:  \nWomen fulfilling the following characteristics: \n\u2022 With a clinical diagnosis of SUI or stress predominant MUI \n\u2022 Who consider that their family is complete \n\u2022 Who have undergone a course of pelvic floor muscle training (+\/- other non surgical treatments \nfor their urge symptoms) with inadequate resolution of symptoms \n\u2022 Both the woman herself and her treating clinician should agree that surgery is an appropriate and \nacceptable next line of treatment. \n \nExclusion criteria: \n\u2022 Symptomatic utero-vaginal prolapse requiring treatment \n\u2022 Previous surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse \n\u2022 Urodynamic investigation within the last three years \n\u2022 Neurological disease causing urinary incontinence \n\u2022 Current involvement in competing research studies \n\u2022 Unable or unwilling to give informed consent \n \nOver a nine-month recruitment period, assigned research nurses will identify and obtain consent from \neligible patients.  The outpatient clinics run by each unit will be the source of potential recruits.  Notes will \nbe screened prior to the appointment and a patient information sheet posted with the appointment letter \nif, in so far as can be judged from records alone, the patient meets eligibility criteria.  This will allow any \nquestions that the woman may have to be addressed within the forthcoming clinic visit.  Informed, \nwritten consent will be taken from those who agree to take part.  \n 6\nA small number may be identified only at the time of attendance at the clinic.  They will be invited to \nparticipate and given the relevant information.  The research nurse will contact the patient after a period \nof at least 24 hours, respond to any questions they may have and review their decision regarding \ninvolvement. \nConsent to retain contact details will be obtained from those declining recruitment into the pilot trial but \nwho are willing to be contacted for the qualitative interviews. \nParticipants will be informed prior to recruitment that they can withdraw at any stage of the research \nwithout having to provide a reason and that withdrawal will not affect the care they receive. \n \nRANDOMISATION \nPatients who have given consent will be randomised 1:1 to either the control or intervention arm, by an \ninternet-accessed system operated by the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit.  Randomisation will be stratified \nby centre, using a random block length to minimise the risk of breech of concealment of allocation. \n \nBLINDING \nDue to the nature of this trial it is not possible to blind participants and clinicians after randomisation. \n \nINTERVENTION AND CONTROL CONDITIONS \nControl arm: \nParticipants will undergo basic clinical assessment supplemented by non-invasive tests as directed by the \nclinician.  These may include frequency\/volume charting, mid-stream urine culture, urine flow rate and \nresidual urine volume measurement by ultrasound; they will not undergo invasive urodynamic testing.  \nSubsequently, if agreed to by the clinician and the patient, they will undergo surgical treatment.  Given \nthe pragmatic nature of the study the choice of operation will be left to the individual surgeon and \npatient. \nIntervention arm: \nParticipants will undergo assessment as above and will also undergo invasive urodynamic testing.  Usually \nthis will be multi-channel cystometry; however, videourodynamics and long-term ambulatory bladder \npressure monitoring may also be included at the discretion of the clinician. \nWomen will undergo similar surgical treatment if urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) is confirmed on \nIUT.  This will comprise the majority of women.  Where other diagnoses are identified they will be offered \nalternative treatments according to current NICE recommendations.\n5\n In some cases, where mixed \nabnormalities are reported, women may first undergo one or more of these treatments and then proceed \nto surgery for SUI.  Postoperative follow up will be arranged in accordance with the clinician\u2019s usual \npractice. \n \nDATA COLLECTION \nThe questionnaires to be administered in the pilot trial are those proposed for the definitive trial, as \ndescribed below. \nFollowing randomisation all patients will be asked to complete baseline study outcome questionnaires. \n 7 \nData will be collected from the hospital records throughout the patient\u2019s participation in the study to \nrehearse the data collection methods for the definitive trial.  Data will include details of non-invasive and \ninvasive investigations, operative and in-patient procedures including postoperative complications, non-\nsurgical treatments and resource utilisation. \nWomen in both arms will complete a follow-up study outcome questionnaire six months after the first \ntreatment they receive in the trial.  Questionnaire response will be encouraged by providing prepaid \nenvelopes and posting one-month reminder letters. \nOUTCOMES \nThe pilot trial \nThe outcome measures for the initial feasibility study are: \n\u2022 Number of eligible patients in each unit, and the rates of recruitment, randomisation and data \ncompletion.  \n\u2022 The confirmation or otherwise that units are able to identify the required number of eligible \nwomen and recruit them. \n\u2022 The acceptability of the investigation strategies as manifest though recruitment and retention \nlevels.  \n\u2022 The feasibility and acceptability of data collection tools measured by completion rates and quality \nof data. \n\u2022 Clinical outcome data to estimate the necessary sample size for the definitive trial. \nWhilst it is not possible to be categorical about it at this stage, the criteria used to establish feasibility, and \nto confirm a decision to proceed with a definitive trial, will be determined as a compound function of the \nabove factors.   \nThe required sample size for a subsequent definitive trial will be calculated using the clinical outcome \ndata from the pilot trial.  A definitive trial will be judged to be feasible if the numbers of eligible patients \nrecruited, randomised and retained within the pilot trial, plus the number of surgeons in clinical equipoise \non the subject who are prepared to randomise their patients indicate that it will be possible to generate \nthe required sample within a period of 24 months.   \nThe protocol for the definitive trial will be modified to improve recruitment based \nupon the findings of the qualitative interviews with patients not randomised to the \npilot trial.  Similarly, if the experiences of those women randomised, or the study \nteam\u2019s experience of the pilot indicate that protocol modifications may be of value \nthen these would also be considered within the judgment of feasibility. \n \n \nThe definitive trial \nShould we proceed to a definitive trial, the currently favoured primary outcome is the combined symptom \nscore of the International Consultation on Incontinence Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \nquestionnaire (ICIQ-FLUTS) at 6 months after treatment.[18]\n \n A patient reported outcome measure has \nbeen selected because clinician assessment of patient outcomes tends to underestimate the patients\u2019 \nperceived symptoms.[19] \nSecondary outcomes will include the quantification of urinary leakage (three day bladder diary and ICIQ-\nUI Short Form), the prevalence of symptomatic \u2018de novo\u2019 functional abnormalities including voiding \ndysfunction and detrusor overactivity (subscales of ICIQ-FLUTS, with cystometry in symptomatic patients), \nthe impact of urinary symptoms on quality of life (ICIQ-LUTSqol and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI)) \n 8\nand utility values from the EQ-5D questionnaire and SF-6D (utility score generated from SF-12 \nquestionnaire).[20]  These are rehearsed within the pilot study with a view to refining the choice and \ntiming of outcomes for the main trial, based on data yield (e.g. the percentage of recruited participants \nreturning completed questionnaires) and quality (e.g. the completeness and consistency of responses \nwithin returned questionnaires). \n \n \nSAMPLE SIZE \nThere is relatively little information on the distribution of the ICIQ-FLUTS combined symptom score or on \nrecruitment, randomisation and retention rates in the relevant patient population.  As a result there are \ninsufficient data to calculate the sample size required in a definitive trial to yield adequate power to \ndetect a clinically important difference in the primary outcome measure.  This is one of the main reasons \nto undertake the pilot trial. \nThe sample size for pilot trials is typically determined pragmatically, with recommendations of a minimum \nof 30 participants per arm.[21]\n \n We aim to recruit 60 per trial arm to investigate the distribution of the \noutcome measures.  Previous trials in the area of pelvic floor dysfunction, including investigation,[22] \nsurgical,[23-25]\n \nand non-surgical treatments[26] suggest attrition rates of 13% (7-20%) between \nidentification and randomization, 16% (6-20%) between randomization and treatment, and 13% (9-20%) \nbetween treatment and follow-up at 6 months.  Taking the more pessimistic figure in each case we \nestimate that a total of 240 eligible patients should be approached allowing for a 50% overall attrition.  \nThe recruiting units collectively undertake 540 relevant procedures per year; therefore, identifying 240 \neligible women within the nine month recruitment period should not present undue difficulty. \n \nRESULTS\/ANALYSIS \nData will be analysed after all patients have completed six months follow up.  The statistical analysis will \nbe descriptive in nature and provide estimates of key trial variables for the definitive trial to inform power \ncalculations and other aspects of the trial design.  The cost-utility analysis will be rehearsed which may \ninform the study hypothesis for the definitive trial as well as informing the analysis plan. \n \nQUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL \nPARTICIPANTS \nA sample of women approached to participate in the pilot trial will be invited to take part in the \nqualitative interviews.  Purposive sampling will be used to include women from a range of ages, trial \nparticipation status (did not agree to participate, agreed to participation and retained to follow-up, \nagreed to participation but provided incomplete follow up data), allocation status (IUT or basic \nassessment), treatment received (surgery or conservative), and study site. \n \nINTERVENTION \nThe selected women will receive a postal invitation from the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit.  If they are \ninterested in participating, they will be asked to return an enclosed expression of interest form.  \nArrangements for the interview will then be made.  Women declining participation into the pilot trial will \nbe approached as soon as possible after that decision; those participating in the trial will be approached \nat the end of their participation in the trial to capture their overall experience. \nWritten, informed consent will be taken prior to the interview.  An expert qualitative interviewer will \nconduct the interviews which, with permission, will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.  \n 9\nInterviews will be semi-structured using a prompt guide with broad topic areas but emphasis will be on \ndiscussing the women\u2019s own perspectives freely.  The prompt guide has been developed using a \ncombination of the background literature and expert qualitative research experience.  It may be modified, \nif necessary, as the interviews progress to incorporate issues raised by interviewees that have not been \nanticipated but are of interest.[27]  It is anticipated that 25-30 interviews will be required, but data \ncollection will continue until a point of theoretical saturation has been reached.[28, 29] \n \nRESULTS\/ANALYSIS \nThe aims of the interviews are to explore women\u2019s understanding and experience of the study, their \ndecisions around participation and their perceived barriers to and facilitators of participation. \nTheir responses may help not only in the evaluation of the feasibility of a definitive trial, but also in the \nplanning and optimising of recruitment and retention e.g. to refine the content of information, \nrecruitment and data collection procedures used. \nBoth data collection and analysis will be iterative.  Data will be analysed using the constant comparative \nmethod,[29] supported by NVivo software.[30]  \n \nNATIONAL CLINICIAN SURVEY \nPARTICIPANTS \nAll members of the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) and British Association of Urological \nSurgeons Section of Female, Neurological and Urodynamic Urology (BAUS-SFNUU) with current email \naddresses on the membership database of the respective organisations will be involved.  Apart from a few \nexceptions, clinicians are only members of one society.  These urologists and gynaecologists are the \nintended source of patient recruitment for the definitive trial and reviews indicate that endorsement by \nrespected authorities is a factor in enhancing response rates in postal and self-completion surveys.[31-34]\n \n \nINTERVENTION \nMembers will be invited by email, sent from the society secretariat, with the support of the research \ncommittees of the aforementioned societies, to complete either a web-based (\u2018SurveyMonkey.com\u2019) or \npaper-based questionnaire; this support has already been obtained from both societies.  Reminders will \nbe sent three and six weeks after initial contact to encourage and stimulate response.[31, 32, 34]  The \ndata set will be closed and prepared for analysis twelve weeks after initial contact as experience in \nprevious surveys shows that the majority of responses are made within this period.  This survey approach \nwill enable collection of data from a large sample of respondents over a wide geographical area in a \ntimely and efficient manner. \nThe survey questionnaire will contain both open and closed questions and will ask for the respondent\u2019s \nviews about, access to, and current use of IUT.  Part of the survey will include brief details of the proposed \ndefinitive trial in the form of a \u2018vignette\u2019 and will seek to ascertain the clinician\u2019s willingness to participate \nand randomise their patients within such a trial.  The questionnaire will be piloted on non-members to \nassess comprehensibility and content validity.  \n \nRESULTS\/ANALYSIS \nThe method of statistical analysis will be descriptive in nature.  Data will be collected on \nthe strength of surgeons\u2019 views for the necessity of invasive dynamic testing for a set of \nvignettes using an 11-point Likert scale.  These distributions will be summarised by their \n 10 \nmedians, quartiles and range.  Other variables such as their willingness to take part in a \nfuture randomised trial and views on the importance of the questions will be \nsummarised by percentages in each category. \n \nQUALITATIVE CLINICIAN INTERVIEWS \nPARTICIPANTS\/INTERVENTION\/ANALYSIS \nClinicians participating in the national survey will be invited, at the same time, to take part in this \ninterview.  If they accept they will be asked to return an expression of interest form with their contact \ndetails. \nA purposive sample of these clinicians will undergo a short telephone interview to explore their \ninterpretation of IUT and how they use the results to decide on the most appropriate treatment options.  \nTwelve interviews should ensure that a range of views are represented (e.g. those who do and do not \ncurrently use IUT, those who do and do not feel is it an important part of their decision making and those \nwho would or would not be willing to participate in a later trial), but data collection will continue until a \npoint of theoretical saturation is reached.[27]  \nTelephone interviews enable this to be done efficiently.  Electronic, written consent will be obtained prior \nto the interview. \nAnalysis will identify key themes related to the use of IUT and possible involvement in a later trial. \n \nTRIAL GOVERNANCE \nA favourable ethical opinion for this research has been received from Newcastle and North Tyneside No1 \nResearch Ethics committee (reference10\/H0906\/76). \nThe operational management of the trial will be overseen by a Trial Management Group that has \nresponsibility for ensuring the compliance and progress of the study in relation to all regulatory, \nadministrative, academic and clinical\/safety issues. \nThe Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will focus on the safety and ethical issues.  Their role \nwill be to monitor data and make recommendations on whether or not the trial should continue for \nethical or safety reasons.  DMEC membership will comprise an independent chair, an independent \nstatistician and one other member, independent of the research team, with relevant content area or \nmethodological expertise. \nThe Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will provide overall supervision for the trial on behalf of the Trial \nSponsor (Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) and Trial Funder (NIHR HTA) and will \nensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice.[35]  The \ncommittee membership comprises and independent chair, two other independent members with \nrelevant content area or methodological expertise, two lay members, the chief investigator, another \nprincipal investgator, the trial statistician, and the senior trial manager. \nR&D approval for all participating sites has been sought, via the NIHR Coordinated System for gaining NHS \npermissions (CSP); this system seeks to ensure that all quality assurance and statutory requirements in \nrespect of clinical research are met, through standardising and streamlining the process for gaining NHS \nPermission in England.[36] \nAll data will be kept in accordance with Caldicott Principles,[37] and will be archived at the Newcastle \nUpon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust archive facility for ten years following the last publication \nfrom the study. \n \n 11\nDISCUSSION \nPilot studies play an important role in health research.  A well-conducted pilot study with clear aims and \nobjectives encourages methodological rigour, ensures that the work is scientifically valid and publishable, \nand results in higher quality RCTs.[21]  Lancaster et al. produced a framework and addressed some of the \nmethodological reasons for undertaking pilot studies related to RCTs.[21]  Using this framework as a guide \nwe summarise below our justifications for undertaking a pilot study and its methodology. \nThe randomised external pilot trial rehearses the methodology proposed for the definitive RCT.  A run \nthrough of the trial procedures on a smaller scale will practise and identify any logistical issues that might \nbe modified.  The number of eligible patients and rates of recruitment and randomisation will confirm \nwhether the required sample size for a definitive trial could be identified and recruited.  Recruitment has \nimplications for both timing and funding of a definitive trial and poor recruitment is one of the major \nreasons for abandoning trials early.[21, 38]  A RCT to address whether IUT alters treatment decisions and \ntreatment outcome in women suitable for surgical treatment of SUI or stress predominant MUI is likely to \nrequire large numbers of participants and would therefore be expensive and time-consuming.  Prior to \nallocating resources to such a large trial feasibility must be determined to reduce the risk of the definitive \ntrial not being able to recruit to time and target. \nData collection for the proposed definitive trial consists of both clinical records data and patient self-\ncompleted questionnaires.  The outcome questionnaires rely on patient recall over a six month period and \nanalysis of completion rates and quality of data will not only test comprehensibility but guide timing of \nfuture data collection.  Several secondary outcome measures have been chosen with a view to refining \nthe choice on the basis of data yield and quality.  The demands of a trial are an identified barrier to \npatient participation and refinement of the data collection tools will ensure these are kept to a \nminimum.[38] \nQualitative interviews with the women will explore their reasons for participating, or not, and their \nexperiences of the trial with the potential benefit of guiding protocol amendments such as the consent \nprocedure and questionnaire format, to improve the recruitment process and questionnaire responses.  \nThe acceptability of the protocol is an important aspect of the trial design.  As mentioned previously IUT is \nwidely established in clinical practice and the absence of this investigation prior to offering surgery is a \npotential barrier to clinicians\u2019 willingness to randomise their patients.  Clinician surveys in other \nurogynaecology research have identified clinicians\u2019 views of perceived benefit and complications of the \ntwo arms as impacting participation.[14]  Women may also not see the benefit of testing a test, believing \nthat the results of any available test must guide their clinician and themselves to the most appropriate \nmanagement.  Prior to embarking on a definitive RCT we need to ensure that not only are the participants \nwilling to be randomised but that the clinicians are also willing to randomise their patients.  A UK national \nsurvey of clinicians\u2019 views on IUT in this particular context and their willingness to randomise patients \nwithin a definitive trial will help establish if sufficient clinicians are in equipoise.  Qualitative interviews \nwith a sub group of clinicians will help contextualise the responses.  During the qualitative interviews with \nthe women willingness to be randomised will also be explored. \nAttempts to estimate sample size for a definitive trial were unproductive because of uncertainty in the \ndistribution of the key variables.  The pilot study aims to collect data on the primary outcome measure, \nthe ICIQ-FLUTS combined symptom score, to calculate the sample size for a definitive trial.  \nThe decision to proceed with the definitive trial as it is currently envisaged will only be made if all aspects \nof feasibility, including adequate patient recruitment and clinician engagement are established.  The \ncombination of quantitative methods (e.g. recruitment and retention rates, percentage of clinicians in \nclinical equipoise) and qualitative methods (e.g. an assessment of whether any identified barriers to \nrecruitment and retention could be overcome by modifications to trial design or procedures) will inform \nthe decision and ensure its effectiveness in achieving the research aim. \nCurrently there are two other on-going trials looking at the clinical utility of urodynamics in similar patient \ngroups; the VaIUE trial (Value of Urodynamic Evaluation)[39] and VUSIS-2 trial (Value of Urodynamics \n 12 \nprior to Stress Incontinence Surgery).[40]  Similar to INVESTIGATE-I, the ValUE study randomises women \nwith a clinical diagnosis of SUI or stress predominant MUI to either no further assessment or IUT.  In the \nVUSIS study all women undergo invasive urodynamic testing.  Those with discordant clinical and \nurodynamic findings are randomised between surgical treatment as dictated by their clinical assessment \nand individualised treatment dictated by a combination of clinical and urodynamic results and therefore \naddresses a different clinical question.  Both of these definitive trials use a non-inferiority design.[41]  \nWhereas VUSIS does not define a non-inferiority margin VaIUE defines a margin of 11% which we consider \nsomewhat high and a difference that might potentially influence the decisions of both clinicians and \npatients.  The primary outcome of both is based on the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) score at 12 \nmonths.  Although our primary outcome is the ICIQ-FLUTS combined symptom score we have chosen to \ninclude the UDI as an additional secondary outcome.  If we subsequently proceed to the definitive trial, \nINVESTIGATE-II, assuming the other studies complete recruitment and publish their results, this will allow \neasier comparison of results.  While we are encouraged to see that others look on this topic as being an \nimportant clinical uncertainty, we remain of the opinion that a feasibility study is an important step \nbefore embarking on a definitive trial. \n \nCOMPETING INTERESTS \nPH - No current financial interests; previous chair of NICE Guideline Development Group (GDG) on urinary \nincontinence in women; previous member NETSCC-HTA Interventional Procedures Panel, and Clinical \nEvaluations and Trials Prioritisation Group; previous commercial research funding for trials of surgery for \nstress incontinence from Gynecare (1998-2003) and Gyne Ideas (now Mpathy Medical) (2001-2003).
