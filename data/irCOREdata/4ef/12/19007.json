These results\nprovide the first definitive evidence that Sykmediates phos-\nphorylation of the CLEC-2 hemITAM receptor with Src family\nkinases playing a critical role further downstream through the\nregulation of Syk and other effector proteins, providing a new\nparadigm in signaling by YXXL-containing receptors.\nThe C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2 is a type II trans-\nmembrane protein that is highly expressed on the surface of\nplatelets and megakaryocytes (1, 2) and at a lower level on\nseveral other hematopoietic lineages, including monocytes\nand dendritic cells (3\u20135). The first ligand to be identified for\nCLEC-2 was the powerful snake venom toxin, rhodocytin,\npurified from the Malayan pit viper, Calloselasma rhodostoma\n(2). F(ab)2 antibody fragments of CLEC-2 antibodies were\nsubsequently shown to mediate activation of human platelets\n(2, 6). The transmembrane protein podoplanin was identified\nas an endogenous ligand, inducing powerful activation of\nplatelets and CLEC-2-expressing cell lines (2, 6\u20138). Podopla-\nnin is expressed on the surface of a wide variety of cells such\nas kidney podocytes, lung type I alveolar cells, and lymphatic\nendothelial cells but is absent from vascular endothelial cells\nand platelets. The activation of CLEC-2 by podoplanin is es-\nsential for the separation of the lymphatic and blood vascula-\ntures (9\u201312). In addition, the expression of podoplanin on the\nsurface of certain tumors is implicated in the process of tu-\nmor metastasis through activation of CLEC-2 (8, 13). CLEC-2\nhas recently been reported to play a role in supporting platelet\nactivation at arteriolar rates of flow on collagen in some (6,\n11) but not all studies (14).\nCLEC-2 is expressed on resting platelets as a noncovalent\nhomodimer (15, 16) and signals through a single YXXL se-\nquence in its cytoplasmic tail known as a hem-immunorecep-\ntor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM)8 (2, 15\u201317).\nThe minimal signaling unit for activation of Syk by CLEC-2\nhas been proposed to be the cross-linking of two CLEC-2\ndimers (15, 16), activating a similar signaling cascade to that\nof the platelet collagen receptor GPVI-FcR\u0001-chain complex,\nwith critical roles for LAT (linker for activation of T cells),\nSLP-76 (Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein\nof 76 kDa), phosphoinositide 3-kinases, and phospholipase C\n(PLC) \u00012 (2, 17). CLEC-2 signaling occurs in lipid rafts and is\ndependent on actin polymerization, release of the secondary\nmediators ADP and thromboxane A2, and activation of the\nsmall G protein Rac (18).\nPhosphorylation of the GPVI-FcR\u0001-chain ITAM is medi-\nated by Src family kinases leading to subsequent binding and\nactivation of Syk. Thus, ITAM phosphorylation is preserved\nin the absence of Syk or the Syk inhibitor R406 (19, 20). The\nSrc family kinases Lyn and Fyn mediate phosphorylation of\nthe GPVI-FcR\u0001-chain ITAM (21\u201323). Fyn and Lyn bind to a\nproline-rich region in the cytosolic tail of GPVI via their Src\nhomology 3 domains, allowing for rapid initiation of platelet\nactivation (21, 24). In addition, they also support activation by\na second pathway of activation that is independent of the\nGPVI proline-rich motif (25). Recently, it has been proposed\nthat GPVI-associated Lyn is in an active conformation, sug-\n\u25a1S The on-line version of this article (available at http:\/\/www.jbc.org) con-\ntains supplemental Fig. S1.\nAuthor\u2019s Choice\u2014Final version full access.\n1 Both authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 Supported by British Heart Foundation Grant PG\/06\/129\/21681.\n3 Supported by Wellcome Trust Grant 088410.\n4 Supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education (EX2009_0242).\n5 Supported byDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant SFB\/TR23 Project A8.\n6 British Heart Foundation Intermediate Fellow.\n7 British Heart Foundation Chair CH\/03\/003.

However, it has recently\nbeen reported that phosphorylation of CLEC-2 in human\nplatelets stimulated by rhodocytin is blocked by selective\ninhibitors of Src family or Syk tyrosine kinases, implicating\nthese kinases in hemITAM phosphorylation (20). One po-\ntential explanation for these observations is that Syk medi-\nates CLEC-2 phosphorylation and that Src family kinases\nregulate Syk. Thus, the proximal events in signaling by\nhemITAM receptors appear to be distinct from those used\nby ITAM receptors.\nIn the present study, we have investigated the molecular\nevents underlying CLEC-2 phosphorylation in mouse platelets\nusing mutant mice deficient in the major platelet Src family\nkinases (Fyn, Lyn, and Src), the tyrosine kinase Syk, and the\nglobal regulator of Src family kinases in platelets, CD148. The\nresults provide the first demonstration that Syk and not Src\nfamily kinases mediate hemITAM phosphorylation and iden-\ntify Src family kinases regulating platelet activation down-\nstream of Syk.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nReagents\u2014Rhodocytin was purified from C. rhodostoma\nvenom as described previously (2). Rat anti-mouse CLEC-2\nIgG mAb and rabbit anti-Syk (BR15) polyclonal antibody were\nfrom previously described sources (4, 26). CLEC-2 IgM anti-\nbody was a gift from Dr. Caetano Reis e Sousa. Hamster anti-\nmouse CD148 antibody (8A-1) was generated as described\n(27). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was pur-\nchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. pY1217 PLC\u00012\nantibody was from Cell Signaling Technology. HRP-conju-\ngated secondary anti-rabbit IgG and \u0001-bind protein\nG-Sepharose were from GE Healthcare. Anti-rat Fc anti-\nbody was from Abcam. All other reagents were purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich.\nAnimals\u2014fyn\u0001\/\u0001, lyn\u0001\/\u0001, and src\u0001\/\u0001 breeding pairs were\nfrom Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). fyn\u0001\/\u0001 lyn\u0001\/\u0001\ndouble knock-out mice were raised from mixed breeding of\nfyn\u0001\/\u0001 and lyn\u0001\/\u0001mice. CD148\u0001\/\u0001mice were generated as\ndescribed previously (28). Experimental controls were wild-\ntype littermates. No differences were observed in platelet\nfunction between the different wild-type controls. The mice\nwere genotyped by PCR amplification of mouse tail genomic\nDNA. Lack of protein expression was confirmed by Western\nblotting platelet lysates. The mice were housed under specific\npathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional\nguidelines approved by United Kingdom Home Office and\nwere used between 8 and 12 weeks of age.\nGeneration of Chimeric Mice\u2014Radiation chimeras were\ngenerated as described previously (19). Briefly, 8-week-old\nC57BL\/6 mice received two doses of irradiation each of 500\nGy 3 h apart. The mice were then reconstituted with an intra-\nvenous injection of 1\u20132\u0002 106 fetal liver cells obtained from\nembryonic days 14\u201316 lyn\u0003\/\u0003 src\u0003\/\u0003, lyn\u0001\/\u0001 src\u0001\/\u0001, fyn\u0003\/\u0003\nsrc\u0003\/\u0003, fyn\u0001\/\u0001 src\u0001\/\u0001, syk\u0003\/\u0003, syk\u0001\/\u0001, and clec-2\u0003\/\u0003 or clec-\n2\u0001\/\u0001mouse livers. The genotype of the reconstituting fetal\nliver cells was confirmed in each case by PCR. Lack of protein\nexpression was confirmed by Western blotting platelet ly-\nsates. Reconstituted mice were used for experiments at 8\nweeks after irradiation.\nPreparation of Mouse Platelets\u2014Whole blood was drawn\nfrom the inferior vena cava into acid citrate dextrose (1\u20449 vol-\nume) from CO2-asphyxiated mice following isofluorane anes-\nthesia. Washed mouse platelets were obtained as described\npreviously (29). Briefly, platelets were obtained by centrifuga-\ntion using prostaglandin I2 to prevent activation during the\nisolation procedure. Washed platelets were then resuspended\nin modified HEPES Tyrode buffer (134 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl,\n12 mM NaHCO3, 0.34 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM\nglucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, and 5 mM glucose, pH\n7.3) at a density of 2\u0002 108 platelets\/ml. Aggregation was\nmonitored by light transmission using a Born lumi-aggre-\ngometer (Chronolog, Havertown, PA).\nImmunoprecipitation Studies\u2014Washed resting or stimulated\nplatelets (300\u0002l at 2\u0002 108 platelets\/ml) were lysed with an equal\nvolume of 2\u0002Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20mMTris-HCl, pH\n7.6, 300mMNaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 2mM EDTA, 2%Nonidet P-40,\n2 mM PMSF, 5 mMNa3VO4, 10\u0002g\/ml leupeptin, 10\u0002g\/ml apro-\ntinin, 1\u0002g\/ml pepstatin). Cell debris was removed by centrifuga-\ntion at 15,000\u0002 g for 10min. An aliquot of whole cell lysate was\ndissolved in reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Syk immunopre-\ncipitation was carried out as standard protocol (30, 31). Platelet\nlysate was precleared, 2\u0002l of anti-Syk antibody and a 15-\u0002l bed\nvolume of protein A-Sepharose were added, and each sample\nwas rotated at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. The pellet was washed four\ntimes sequentially in lysis buffer before the addition of 20\n\u0002l of reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Modifications from\nstandard immunoprecipitation protocols were made for\nmouse CLEC-2 immunoprecipitations. The amount of\nCLEC-2 mAb in each sample was normalized to 3 \u0002g. 20 \u0002l\nof bed volume of \u0001-bind protein G-Sepharose was added to\neach sample and allowed to capture the antibody for 1 h\nwith rotation at 4 \u00b0C. Following four washes with 1\u0002 lysis\nbuffer, 20 \u0002l of nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer was\nadded. 75% of the sample proteins was separated on a SDS-\npolyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF mem-\nbrane. After blocking in 2% BSA, the membranes were in-\ncubated with 4G10 antibody overnight, washed, and then\nincubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Im-\nmunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by chemolumi-\nnescence (ECL; Pierce). For CLEC-2 immunoprecipita-\ntions, the remaining 25% was treated in the same way but\nincubated with CLEC-2 mAb overnight.\nPlatelet Surface Protein Cross-linking\u2014After platelet stimu-\nlation, 1.5 mM Sulfo-EGS was added and allowed to incubate\nat room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched\nwith the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; 25 mM) and allowed to\nincubate for a further 20 min at room temperature. The sam-\nples were lysed with the addition of an equal volume of 2\u0002\nice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer.\nCell Lines\u2014CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3 con-\ntaining full-length mouse podoplanin using a calcium phos-\nSrc Family Kinases and Syk in CLEC-2 Signaling\n4108 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 286\u2022NUMBER 6\u2022FEBRUARY 11, 2011\n at The University of Birm\ningham\n, on February 10, 2011\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nphate transfection method.

The time to onset of aggregation de-\ncreases with increasing concentrations of antibody (Fig. 1B).\nRhodocytin also stimulated concentration-dependent phos-\nphorylation with the delay in onset also decreasing with increas-\ning concentrations (Fig. 1, B andC). Concentrations of CLEC-2\nmAb (10\u0002g\/ml) and rhodocytin (30 nM) that were just sufficient\nto inducemaximal CLEC-2 phosphorylation and aggregation\nwere chosen for further experiments, unless stated.\nWe have previously reported that CLEC-2-mediated activa-\ntion of human platelets is abolished in the presence of Src\nfamily kinase inhibitors (2, 17). Consistent with this, we show\nthat the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 also blocks aggrega-\ntion of mouse platelets stimulated by CLEC-2 mAb and by\nrhodocytin (Fig. 2A), confirming a critical role for Src family\nkinases in CLEC-2-induced platelet activation. Tyrosine phos-\nphorylation of both CLEC-2 and the downstream kinase Syk\nis completely blocked by PP2 in response to CLEC-2 mAb.\nStrikingly, however, phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by rhodocy-\ntin is not altered in the presence of PP2 (Fig. 2B). The inhibi-\ntion of aggregation to the snake toxin by PP2 (Fig. 2A) is ex-\nplained by the partial reduction in Syk phosphorylation and\ninhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of residue Tyr-1217 of\nthe downstream protein PLC\u00012 (Fig. 2B), a residue shown to\nbe correlated with its activity (32). These results demonstrate\nthat Src family kinases do not mediate phosphorylation of\nCLEC-2 in mouse platelets stimulated by rhodocytin but that\nthey play a role in the hemITAM phosphorylation induced by\na CLEC-2 mAb.\nDistinct Roles for Fyn, Lyn, and Src in Platelet Activation by\nCLEC-2\u2014The major Src family kinases known to be ex-\npressed in mouse platelets are Fyn, Lyn, and Src, although\nthere is evidence for the presence of other isoforms (33, 34).\nTo dissect the role of individual Src family kinases in CLEC-2-\nmediated signaling, we used mice deficient in the three major\nplatelet Src family kinases, Fyn, Lyn, or Src, after first estab-\nlishing that the absence of one Src family kinase did not alter\nexpression of the others (supplemental Fig. S1).

In contrast, plate-\nlets doubly deficient in Fyn\/Src exhibited only a very minor\ndelay in onset of platelet aggregation (Fig. 4, B and D).\nCLEC-2 phosphorylation was abolished in platelets defi-\ncient in Fyn\/Lyn and Lyn\/Src at 180 s (not shown), as was\nthe case for Lyn-deficient platelets (Fig. 3D), but was un-\nchanged in platelets deficient in Fyn\/Src (Fig. 4E and not\nshown).

In contrast, the response to rhodocytin\nwas not altered in mouse platelets doubly deficient in Fyn\/\nLyn, Lyn\/Src, or Fyn\/Src. Given that platelet activation by\nboth CLEC-2 mAb and by rhodocytin is abolished in the\npresence of the broad spectrum inhibitor PP2, these results\ndemonstrate that there are other Src family kinases that\ncontribute to platelet activation downstream of CLEC-2\nand that there may be considerable redundancy between\nSrc family kinases in mediating this effect.\nCD148 Is Dispensable for Platelet Activation by CLEC-2\nLigation\u2014Src family kinases are regulated by phosphorylation\non excitatory and inhibitory tyrosines. Recently, we have\ndemonstrated a reciprocal increase in phosphorylation of the\ninhibitory site and a decrease in phosphorylation of the acti-\nvatory site of all Src family kinases in platelets deficient in the\nreceptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase CD148. This has a\nnet effect of greatly reducing the activity of Src family kinases,\nleading to a marked inhibition of platelet activation by the\nITAM receptor GPVI and by integrin \u0003IIb\u00043 (35). In contrast,\nactivation of mouse platelets by CLEC-2 mAb (3 and 10 \u0002g\/\nml) or by rhodocytin (10 and 30 nM) is not significantly al-\ntered in the absence of CD148 (Fig. 5 and not shown), demon-\nFIGURE 4.

Phosphor-\nylation of CLEC-2 and aggregation of platelets induced by the\nCLEC-2 mAb or by rhodocytin were completely blocked in\nSyk-deficient platelets (Fig. 6, B and C), demonstrating that\nSyk is essential for phosphorylation of the CLEC-2 hemI-\nTAM. Thus, the role of Lyn in mediating phosphorylation of\nCLEC-2 in response to the CLEC-2 mAb may be mediated via\nphosphorylation of Syk (Fig. 3D), which is regulated by both\nautophosphorylation and phosphorylation by Src family ki-\nnases (36).\nRole of Src Family Kinases in CLEC-2 Signaling Induced by\nPodoplanin-expressing Cell Lines and Other Multivalent\nLigands\u2014The differential role of Src family kinases in mediat-\ning phosphorylation of CLEC-2 by CLEC-2 mAb and by\nrhodocytin could reflect the degree of cross-linking of\nCLEC-2 (37, 38). Thus, the tetrameric rhodocytin (37) is able\nto cluster CLEC-2 to a much greater degree than the dimeric\nIgG mAb. This is illustrated in platelets treated with the\nchemical cross-linker SulfoEGS (Fig. 7A). Rhodocytin induced\na much greater reduction in the monomeric form of CLEC-2\nrelative to the CLEC-2 mAb, whereas neither ligand induced\nclustering of the membrane tyrosine phosphatase CD148 (not\nshown), thereby demonstrating that this effect was not due to\nnonspecific cross-linking.\nIn light of this result, we asked whether cross-linking of the\nCLEC-2 mAb using an anti-rat Fc antibody would induce a\nmore powerful degree of platelet activation and whether this\nwould reduce the dependence on Lyn. The addition of a\ncross-linking anti-rat Fc antibody to a concentration of\nCLEC-2 mAb that induced shape change converted the re-\nsponse to a rapid aggregation. Interestingly, a delay in aggre-\ngation was still observed in the absence of Lyn following\ncross-linking by an anti-rat Fc antibody (Fig. 7B) and also in\nFIGURE 5.

How-\never, the response to either of the cell lines was not altered\nin the absence of Lyn (Fig. 7D). These data show that the\ndependence on Lyn is agonist-dependent, with the depen-\ndence being reduced or abolished for ligands that induce\noligomerization of CLEC-2.\nDISCUSSION\nThe present study provides an unequivocal demonstra-\ntion that the tyrosine kinase Syk mediates CLEC-2 phos-\nphorylation following stimulation by rhodocytin and that\nthis is independent of Src family kinase activation. Phos-\nphorylation of CLEC-2 in response to the snake toxin is\nunaltered in platelets deficient or doubly deficient in the\nmajor platelet Src family kinases, namely Fyn, Lyn, and Src,\nor in the global regulator of Src kinases, the membrane ty-\nrosine phosphatase CD148. The ability of broad spectrum\nSrc family kinase inhibitors such as PP2 to block platelet\naggregation by rhodocytin is explained by partial or com-\nplete inhibition of phosphorylation of Syk and downstream\nproteins such as PLC\u00012, respectively. The fact that platelet\naggregation by rhodocytin is not altered in mice deficient\nor doubly deficient in the above Src family kinases demon-\nstrates that one or more other Src family kinases must play\na role in mediating aggregation or that there is consider-\nable redundancy between the Src family kinases in mediat-\ning activation. These results reveal a new pathway of plate-\nlet activation by the hemITAM receptor CLEC-2, which is\ndistinct from that mediated by the ITAM receptor, GPVI.\nCLEC-2 signals through the sequential action of Syk and\nSrc family kinases, whereas GPVI induces sequential acti-\nvation of Src family and Syk kinases, with Src family ki-\nnases playing a further role downstream of Syk.\nThe present study also shows that the role of individual\nmembers of Src family kinases in CLEC-2 signaling is ligand-\nFIGURE 7.

Thus, phosphorylation of CLEC-2 in response to\nthe IgG CLEC-2 antibody is markedly delayed in the absence\nof Lyn and further delayed in the combined absence of Fyn\/\nLyn or Lyn\/Src. On the other hand, phosphorylation is not\naltered in mice doubly deficient in Fyn\/Src, demonstrating\nthat neither of these Src family kinases plays a critical role in\nthe presence of Lyn. The delay in activation seen in the ab-\nsence of Lyn is likely to be mediated by a loss of phosphoryla-\ntion of Syk, which is regulated by Src family kinases and regu-\nlates hemITAM phosphorylation. In contrast, activation of\nplatelets by rhodocytin is not altered in mice that are either\nsingle or doubly deficient in Fyn, Lyn, or Src, whereas the re-\nsponse is abolished in the absence of Syk. Platelet activation\nby two podoplanin-expressing cell lines resembles the mecha-\nnism underlying activation by rhodocytin in that activation is\nalso independent of Lyn but blocked by the Src kinase inhibi-\ntor, PP2.\nThe differential role of Lyn and other Src family kinases in\nmediating platelet activation by rhodocytin, podoplanin-ex-\npressed cell lines, and the CLEC-2 mAb may be related to the\ndegree of clustering of CLEC-2. The antibody to CLEC-2 is an\nIgG and thus induces dimerization of the receptor, generating\na weak intracellular signal. The further clustering of CLEC-2\nwith a secondary antibody induces rapid and powerful activa-\ntion. In contrast, the tetrameric rhodocytin and polymeric\npodoplanin-expressing cells induce a much greater degree of\nreceptor clustering. The differential dependence on Lyn may\nalso be due to spatial aspects of the ligand-CLEC-2 interac-\ntion, because this may influence the degree of Syk\nrecruitment.\nWe have recently reported that phosphorylation of CLEC-2\nin human platelets in response to rhodocytin is abolished in\nthe presence of inhibitors of Src or Syk kinases (20). It was\nunclear, however, from this study which of these kinases me-\ndiated receptor phosphorylation. The demonstration that\nphosphorylation of CLEC-2 in mouse platelets by rhodocytin\nis abolished in the absence of Syk but not in the presence of\nthe Src kinase inhibitor PP2 shows that the hemITAM phos-\nphorylation is mediated by Syk. The explanation for the dif-\nfering dependence of CLEC-2 phosphorylation on Src family\nkinases in the two species could reflect, for example, a differ-\nence in the expression levels of CLEC-2 or of Src family and\nSyk kinases.\nAn important question that emerges from this work is how\nreceptor clustering of CLEC-2 brings about activation of Syk.\nOne explanation is that it is brought about as a result of mass\naction as modeled by Cooper and Qian (39). The key feature\nof this model is that a constitutively active kinase is associated\nwith the receptor in the absence of agonist stimulation. Con-\nsistent with this, we have previously reported constitutive\nactivation of Syk in nonstimulated platelets and transfected\ncell lines (40). Thus, although there may be other components\nthat regulate Src family and Syk kinases upon ligand engage-\nment, this model predicts that clustering alone is sufficient to\nmediate receptor phosphorylation. The reason why phos-\nphorylation of CLEC-2 is mediated by Syk rather than by one\nor more other Src family kinases, as is the case for GPVI-\nFcR\u0001-chain ITAM, may be related to their juxtaposition in\nthe cell. For example, we have recently shown that Syk is lo-\ncalized to plasma membrane in platelets by binding to filamin\nA and that a loss of filamin A markedly impairs signaling by\nthe tyrosine kinase (41).\nIn summary, this study demonstrates for the first time that\nSyk mediates phosphorylation of the CLEC-2 hemITAM and\nthat Src family kinases play a critical role further downstream\nthrough regulation of Syk and other effector proteins includ-\ning PLC\u00012. It is now of considerable interest to establish\nwhether this pathway is unique to CLEC-2 or whether it is\nalso used by other hemITAM receptors.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Reis e Sousa for the CLEC-2 antibod-\nies.
