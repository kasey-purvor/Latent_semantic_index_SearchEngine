Runoff was lower on the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site.\nThe spatial variability of soil water is high and the problems of its measurement are discussed. The quantity of rainfall infiltrated was greater\nunder shrubs than grass-areas, suggesting that shrub roots facilitated preferential flow. The growing season of A. cytisoides began when\nwater was available in the upper soil layers and senescence occurred when the upper soil layers dried to less than 4 % water content. A.\ncytisoides, therefore, relies on water from these layers. The main growth of R. sphaerocarpa occurred when the upper soil layers were\nrelatively dry, so that R. sphaerocarpa must extract water from deeper layers. Results suggest that A. cytisoides accumulates rainfall and\nrunoff and directs water to lower layers for later use, while R. sphaerocarpa  extracts water from deeper soil layers. By mid-summer both\nshrubs had extracted all the available water accumulated in the upper soil layers from cold season rainfall.\nKeywords: water balance, neutron probe, patchy vegetation, mosaic vegetation, Spain, semi arid, Anthyllis cytisoides, Retama sphaerocarpa\nIntroduction\nWater as a resource in south-eastern Spain is becoming\nscarcer, due to climatic and land-use change. In the\nMediterranean Region, rainfall is generally decreasing\n(Palutikoff, 1999) while temperatures are increasing. Based\non tree ring indices from Sierra de Cazorla in the south and\nthe Pyrenees in the north of Spain, Puigdef\u00e1bregas and\nMendizabal (1998) showed that since the 17th century\nautumn-winter rainfall has declined while temperatures have\nmainly been increasing. From instrumental records of the\nMediterranean between 1978 and 1993, O\u00f1atate-Rubalcaba\n(1993) reported a decrease in annual rainfall and a general\nannual increase in temperature.\nAlongside such a drying trend, land use has been changing\nrapidly. In the first half of the 20th century, the rural areas\nof south-eastern Spain became over-populated, so that\nagriculture encroached onto marginal land. Increased\nlivestock stocking densities exhausted the grassland and soil\nerosion followed (Puigdef\u00e1bregas and Mendizabal, 1998).\nSince the 1960s, emigration has led to progressive land\nabandonment and a patchy vegetation has developed, where\n\u2018steppic\u2019 shrubs, such as Artemesia herba-alba, Artemesia\ncampestris, Retama sphaerocarpa, Anthyllis cytisoides and\nRhanterium suaveolens are interspersed by grass and\/or bare\nground (Puigdef\u00e1bregas and Mendizabal, 1998). Influenced\nby the agricultural policies of the European Union and the\nNicole Archer, Tim Hess and John Quinton\n914\nlocal governments of Spain, forest plantations are spreading\ninto areas of marginal land.\nThese marginal lands are often situated in mountainous\nand hilly regions where rainfall is often high. For example,\nin Almeri\u00e1 Province, precipitation at the coast is 150 mm\nwhile inland, on the summits of the mountain ranges, it is\n650 to 700 mm (Lazaro and Rey, 1991). The importance of\nthese areas for collecting and storing rainfall and runoff in\nthe past is demonstrated in a survey of the aljibes (Moorish\ncisterns) in Almer\u00eda province, by Van Wesemael et al.(1998),\nwho found that the aljibes were concentrated on the slopes\nof marginal areas, such as the Sierra de los Filabres, the\nSierra de Gador and Sierra de Gata. Today, in the relative\nabsence of studies of shrubland areas, it is not known\nwhether water is stored within the slopes of these marginal\nareas.\nInvestigation of the hydrological effects of such marginal\nland has been focused mainly upon tree cover, such as\nBenayas (1998), Bergkamp (1998), Domingo et al. (1994),\nPi\u00f1ol et al. (1991), Koechlin et al.(1986), Rambal (1984)\nand Vachaud et al. (1981). Expansion of forest and shrubland\ncan lead to an increase in evapotranspiration and reduction\nin total runoff. Puigdef\u00e1bregas and Mendizabal (1998), using\ndata from southern France and Spain, show that for rainfall\nof less than 400 mm annually, land covered in forest and\nshrubs would yield virtually no drainage. On the other hand,\nforest and shrubland facilitate infiltration by intercepting\nrunoff (Valentin and Herb\u00e9s, 1999) and increase the\nconcentration of rainfall to the base of plants by stemflow\n(Martinez-Meza and Whitford, 1996 and Domingo et al.,\n1998); this can cause localised groundwater recharge. The\neffect of the shrubs that are now colonising abandoned land\nand increasing ground cover has been studied only by Soto\nand Diaz-Fierros (1997) who investigated the effect on the\nsoil water balance of throughfall in gorse (Ulex europeaus,\nL.) and by Belmonte-Serrato and Romero-Diaz (1994), who\nstudied the spatial and temporal behaviour of interception\nflows in Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Pinus\nhalepensis and Juniperus oxycedrus. However, this research\ntakes no account of the non-continuous distribution of shrubs\nin the drier (<400 mm annual rainfall) Mediterranean areas,\nwhere shrubs are interspersed by bare areas or grass.\nBy quantifying the total water balance of two areas on a\nslope dominated by two leguminous shrubs, Retama\nsphaerocarpa and Anthyllis cytisoides, interspersed with\ngrass and bare ground, in an area of marginal land in south-\neastern Spain, the present study tests the hypothesis that\nshrubs do not use all the water available after cold season\nrainfall (most rain in the Mediterranean area falls during\nautumn and winter). These shrubs were chosen because of\nthe differences in their rooting depths, to determine whether\nshrubs with greater rooting depths encourage greater depths\nof water infiltration and abstraction. This study will increase\nthe understanding of natural vegetation dynamics in south-\neastern Spain, ultimately to improve land management\npractices for water conservation in these marginal areas.\nMethodology\nSTUDY SITE\nThe field sites are within the Rambla Honda Experimental\nStation in Almer\u00eda Province of south-eastern Spain\n(37\u00ba 08\u00b4 N, 2\u00ba 22\u00b4 W, 630 m altitude), in the contact zone\nbetween the south slope of the Filabres range and the\nNeogene depression of Sorbas-Tabernas, in the eastern part\nof the Betic Cordillera (Domingo et al., 1996). The Rambla\nHonda is an ephemeral river (rambla) which drains a basin\nof 30.6 km2 (Puigdef\u00e1bregas et al., 1996). The experimental\narea is in the lower part of the basin and has a south-easterly\naspect. The valley comprises a catena of soil and vegetation,\nwhere Stipa tenacissima L. tussocks dominate the upper\nslopes, alluvial fans in the midslopes are populated mainly\nby Anthyllis cytisoides L. shrubs and the lower alluvial fans\nand drainage channels are dominated by Retama\nsphaerocarpa. L. Boiss. The soils have poorly developed\npedogenic horizons and have been classified as Eutric\nFluvisols and Eutric Regosols on the lower part of the fans\nand Eutric Leptosols on the upper fans and hillslopes\n(Puigdef\u00e1bregas et al., 1996). An intensive field study of\nthe Rambla Honda site (Puigdef\u00e1bregas et al., 1996) found\nthat these two soil groups have values of pH ranging from\npH 6.5 to pH 8 and low values of electrical conductivity,\ncation exchange capacity and water holding capacity. From\ngeographic and topographic interpretation of 30 years\u2019 data\nfrom 166 meteorological stations installed in the Almer\u00eda\nprovince, Lazaro and Rey (1991) estimated mean annual\nrainfall to be 300\u2013350 mm and mean air temperature to be\n15.5\u201316.5\u00baC. Rainfall occurs mainly in the autumn and\nwinter between September and February and, normally,\nspring rainfall precedes a pronounced dry season from May\nto September. Rainfall has a high temporal and spatial\nvariation.\nThe field sites each included a grass-dominated area\nadjacent to a shrub-dominated area. This enabled\ndetermination of any shrub effects on the total water storage\nin comparison with a grass-dominated area, where climate\nand soils were considered to be the same. The \u2018Anthyllis\nsite\u2019, located on an upper alluvial fan, faced north-west and\nwith a slope angle of approximately 8\u00ba. The shrub-area was\ndominated by Anthyllis cytisoides L.

It has a branching root system with a\nmain tap root that has been measured in open gully walls in\nthe Rambla Honda to a depth of 2.5 m. The \u2018Retama site\u2019\nwas on a west facing lower alluvial fan with slopes of 2\u00ba in\nthe grass-area and 4\u00ba in the shrub-area; this comprised\nmainly Retama sphaerocarpa L. Boiss (Plate 2), a\nleguminous shrub with photosynthetic stems, very few\nleaves (Pugnaire and Haase, 1996) and an extensive dual\nroot system; surface roots grow radially from a main stump\nand very deep vertical roots are capable of abstracting water\nfrom depths of 16\u201320 m (Hasse et al., 1996).\nNicole Archer, Tim Hess and John Quinton\n916\nMETEOROLOGICAL DATA\nMeteorological data were recorded on an automated\nmeteorological station by the Estacion Experimental De\nZonas Aridas, Almer\u00eda, Spain, at 640 m altitude, 200 m from\nthe Retama site and 300 m from the Anthyllis site. From 11\nDecember 1997 to 12 May 1998, temperature, wind speed,\nnet radiation, relative humidity, vapour pressure and rainfall\nwere recorded at hourly intervals. Unfortunately, there was\nnot a complete dataset throughout the period of study so\nthat rainfall data had to be supplemented by two automatic\nrain gauges, installed by the University of Amsterdam (The\nNetherlands) on alluvial fans 100 m from each site during\n11 December 1997 to 2 February 1998.\nSOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nUsing bulk density rings, replicates of three soil cores were\ntaken from each site at a depth of 0.5 m. Each soil core was\nsaturated and then placed on a sand table under suctions of\n2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 kPa. After being left at each pressure for\n42 hours, the soil cores were weighed and soil water content\nwas determined. This procedure was repeated, placing the\nsoil cores on pressure membranes which were then put under\nsuctions of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1500 kPa. Soil saturation\nwas determined by the porous plate method (Avery and\nBascombe, 1972). From these results, water release curves\nwere constructed for each site.\nTwelve soil cores, augered to a depth of 1 m on each site\nwere divided into four layers of 0.25 m. For each layer soil\ntexture was determined by dry sieving, using sieve sizes of\n2 mm and 0.21 mm. As there were few aggregates, dry soil\npassed easily through these sieves but soil could not be\nseparated easily below a sieve size of < 0.21 mm. Particle\nsizes were categorised as gravel (> 2 mm), sand (2 mm to\n0.21 mm), and fines (< 0.21 mm).\nSOIL WATER CONTENT AND WATER POTENTIAL\nMEASUREMENT\nIn the spring of 1996, 12 aluminium neutron probe access\ntubes were installed in a grid (three tubes across slope and\nfour down slope) on each site to a depth of 3 m (Fig. 1 a, b).\nTo reduce disturbance of the soil, the tubes were installed\nusing reamers and a rammer as explained in Bell (1976).\nSoil water content of each access tube was determined\nusing a neutron probe (Didcot Instruments, Abingdon, U.K).\nMeasurements began on 11 December 1997 and continued\nuntil July 1998. Water content at each access tube was\nmeasured one day after a rain event (> 5 mm), then five\ndays after a rainfall event and then approximately every two\nweeks thereafter. Readings were taken at 0.25 m intervals\nto a depth of 2.75 m. Within the measurement period, a total\nof 16 measurements were made for each access tube.\nThe neutron probe was calibrated in the laboratory using\na modification of the drum procedure (Greacen et al., 1981;\nLal, 1979). Calibration was carried out on a drum of initially\ndry soil of even bulk density, which was then slowly wetted\nup to 18% water content; as water content was increased,\nneutron probe measurements and soil samples were taken\nto estimate soil water content. Soil samples were taken\nhorizontally with a tree corer through holes bored into the\nside of the drum. In this way very little soil was removed\neach time a measurement was taken and consequently\nmeasurements at different soil water contents could be taken\nwith relatively little soil disturbance. As soil water content\nin the field never exceeded 12%, it was sufficient to calibrate\nthe neutron probe for soil water contents below 18%.\nThe linear regression of the drum calibration was\ncompared with the standard calibration curve for sand,\ngravel and silt (Bell, 1976). A t-test showed that there was\nno significant difference between the standard and the drum\ncalibration (t = \u20132.35, n = 14, p = 0.034).\nThe volumetric soil water contents were estimated by Eqn.\n1, (Bell, 1976):\n(1)\n\u03b8 is the volumetric water fraction at subsequent 0.25 m depth\nintervals, i, to the bottom of the access tube. fi is the layer\nfactor, which is normally the distance between the half\nintervals on either side of the appropriate measuring depth,\n0.25 m in this study, n is the number of intervals down the\nsoil profile between the first soil surface measurement to\nthe measurement above the last bottom measurement; in\nthe present case, it is nine.\nAs the neutron probe was not available at the beginning\nof the autumn, gypsum blocks were installed to give an\nindication of water infiltration during the cold season\nrainfall. They were installed in three groups of four blocks\noutside and within shrubs; each group was positioned at\ndepths of  0.25 m to 1 m and were recorded by a datalogger\nevery half hour.\nAt the beginning of September, before the autumn rainfall,\nsoil samples were taken between 1 m and 2 m depth from\ntwo soil profiles (one on each site), to check for availability\nof soil water at these depths. The water content of these\nsamples was measured gravimetrically.\nRUNOFF MEASUREMENT\n\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n++= \u2211=\n=\n9\n25.0\n2211\nn\ni\nii fffS \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\nThe water balance of two semi-arid shrubs on abandoned land in South-Eastern Spain after cold season rainfall\n917\nFig. 1.

Surface runoff measurement. The thick dotted black line on the site maps\ndelineate the neutron probe tubes that are considered to be in grass and shrub areas.\nEight runoff traps, 0.5 m wide, were installed around the\nedge of the grid of access tubes to collect the runoff from\nthe area instrumented with access tubes and each trap was\nconnected to two 30-litre drums. After every rainfall event,\nthese drums were emptied and the amount of runoff for each\ntrap was recorded. The sizes of the micro-catchments,\nestimated by measuring the maximum slope length of each\nrunoff trap, ranged from 14.9  to 31.7 m and 6.3 m to 14.7 m\non the \u2018Retama\u2019 and \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 sites, respectively. The\ndistributions of these troughs are shown in Fig.1 a, b.\nCatchment areas were estimated for each runoff trap from\ndetailed site maps.\nAfter each rainfall event, the average runoff depth was\ncalculated from the runoff per m2 from each runoff trap,\nfollowed by the average of the eight traps on each site.\nWATER BALANCE\nThe water balance equation considered in this study was:\n(2)\nwhere \u2206S is the change in stored soil water over a period of\ntime, P is the precipitation, R is surface runoff, ET is actual\nevapotranspiration and D is drainage of water.\nPrecipitation, change in stored soil water and runoff were\nall measured in the field. The deepest measurement points\n(2.75 m) for all access tubes were monitored for any drainage\npast the measurement zone of the access tubes. Of the 24\naccess tubes, only two, one in the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site shrub-\narea and the other in the \u2018Retama\u2019 site shrub-area had an\nincrease in soil water of 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively.

Actual evapotranspiration\n(ET) was, thus, estimated by a simplified water balance\nEqn. (3),\n(3)\nREFERENCE CALCULATIONS\nReference evapotranspiration, ETo, was calculated by the\nPenman-Montieth method from daily meteorological data\nusing the methods of Allen et al. (1998). The reference\nevapotranspiration is the evapotranspiration from \u201ca\nhypothetical crop with an assumed height of 12 cm, a fixed\ncanopy resistance of 70 sm\u20131, and an albedo of 0.23, closely\nresembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface\nof green grass of uniform height, actively growing,\ncompletely shading the ground and not short of water\u201d\n(Allen et al., 1994).\nPHENOLOGY OF R. SPHAEROCARPA AND A.\nCYTISOIDES\nGrowth, flowering and senescence of shrubs on each site\nwere monitored each time neutron probe measurements were\ntaken, when new growth, flowers and loss of leaves were\nrecorded.\nResults\nMETEOROLOGICAL DATA\nMost of the rainfall for the 1997 winter occurred during\nSeptember 1997; an unusually high amount (162 mm)\nfalling over only five days caused flooding in the valley\n(Fig. 2). During the period of neutron probe measurement,\nfrom 11 December 1997 to 2 July 1998, rainfall totalled\n131.4 mm; the largest monthly amount, 51 mm, fell in May\n1998. The monthly average rainfall, maximum and minimum\ntemperatures, global radiation, relative humidity and wind\nspeed from 1st December 1997 to 31st July 1998 are shown\nin Table 1. Maximum temperatures and global radiation\nincreased gradually from December to May. Rainfall in May\nwas associated with an increase in relative humidity.\nSOIL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nThe soil on both sites was predominantly sandy. The\n\u2018Retama\u2019 site had significantly (n = 12, p = 0.003) more\ngravel than the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site which had significantly (n =\n12, p = 0.002) more fine particles than the \u2018Retama\u2019 site\n(Fig. 3). The sand fraction between the two sites was not\nsignificantly different. The soil bulk densities at the\n\u2018Anthyllis\u2019 and \u2018Retama\u2019 sites were 1.46 g cm\u20133 and\n1.53 g cm\u20133 respectively.\nField capacity (taken to be the water content at \u201333 kPa)\nwas 14% and 12% (by volume), permanent wilting point\n(at \u20131500kPa) was 3% and 4% and the available water\ncapacities were 11% and 8% for the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 and\n\u2018Retama\u2019 sites, respectively.\nSOIL WATER POTENTIAL AND SOIL WATER\nCONTENT\nThe gypsum blocks did not respond to water potentials above\n\u201350 kPa and below \u20131300 kPa (approximately 12% and 5%\nwater content respectively); however, they gave a good\nindication of when the soil began to wet and they responded\nquickly to changes in soil water potential. Figure 4 shows\nsoil water potential curves at 0.25 m and 1 m soil depth in\n\u2018Anthyllis\u2019 and \u2018Retama\u2019 grass and shrub areas in relation\nto rainfall.

At 0.25 m depth, gypsum\nblocks under the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 grass area were the first to\nrespond to the relatively large rainfall on the 18 and 20\nSeptember 1997 but then were the first to dry. After the\nrainstorms of 26 to 29 September 1997, all layers from\n0.25 m to 1 m became wet under the \u2018Retama\u2019 shrub and\ngrass areas and the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 shrub area. Under shrub areas\nat both sites, water infiltrated to 1 m soil depth before it did\non the grassed areas. By the end of December, all soil layers\nare relatively wet from the infiltration of rainfall, except at\n1 m under grass on the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site. After the September\nstorms there was a drying period at all depths under grass\nand shrubs. Soil water potentials remained generally lower\nat all depths for longer under shrubs while, at 0.25 m soil\ndepth, soil water fluctuated relatively quickly due to rainfall\nand then rapid drying.\nThe soil water content of the two profiles between 1 m\nand 2 m before the September rainfall ranged from 3 to 5%,\nindicating that soil water content below the gypsum blocks\nbefore the cold season rainfall was low.\nTotal soil water contents measured between 11 December\n1997 and 2 July 1998 for 2.75 m profiles are shown in Fig.\n5, along with the rainfalls. An analysis of variance and least\nsquared differences of soil water content showed that the\nmeasured soil water content differed significantly between\nboth sites and between the \u2018Retama\u2019 shrub and grass areas\n(n = 90, p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference\nbetween the grass and shrub areas on the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site.\nThese significant differences (Fig. 5) show that the soil water\ncontent on the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site was consistently higher than\nthat at the \u2018Retama\u2019 site. The grass and shrub-areas of the\n\u2018Retama\u2019 site follow the same pattern of soil water change;\nthe grass-area constantly had higher soil water content than\nthe shrub-area. From December 1997 to February 1998, the\n\u2018Anthyllis\u2019 shrub-area had higher soil water contents than\nthe grass-area but by April to May 1998, the soil water\ncontent under shrubs fell below that under grass. (Fig. 5).\nAfter the rainfall between September and December 1997,\nthe soil water content, relatively high at the beginning of\nthe measurement period, decreased rapidly from February\nto March 1998. Rainfall of 11 mm at the beginning of\nFebruary 1998 caused no  change in soil water content but,\nafter a heavy rainstorm (19 mm) in May 1998, the soil water\ncontent increased at both sites.\nThe soil water contents, averaged for grass and shrub areas\nfor a selection of dates were graphed with mean standard\nerrors (Fig. 6); they show the water content at the start of\nthe measurements and then a trend of drying. In February\n1998, soil water content was highest in the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 shrub-\narea and particularly in the 0.25 m layer; it then decreased\nrapidly to 0.50 m and 0.75 m depths on the \u2018Retama\u2019 and\n\u2018Anthyllis\u2019 sites, respectively.

The water\nbalance was calculated only for the two sites, as runoff\namounts could not be separated for grass and shrub\ntreatments. Because the time of measurements depended\non rainfall events, the soil water measurement periods were\nuneven so it was not possible to calculate the ET exactly for\neach month. No measurements were taken in January, so\nthe first measurement period to be averaged was of 56 days.\nAs only two measurements were taken in June, the water\nbalance was calculated over 23 days and then over 13 days\nto the last measurement taken on 2 July 1998. Table 4 shows\nthat the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site had less runoff, more soil water\nstorage and more loss of water by ET than the \u2018Retama\u2019\nsite.\nCOMPARISON OF ACTUAL AND REFERENCE\nEVAPORATION AND RAINFALL\nCumulative rainfall, ET (average of \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 and\n\u2018Retama\u2019 sites) and ETo during the measurement period are\nshown in Fig. 7. ETo increased rapidly from beginning of\nMarch. The small gradient of cumulative ETo, during the\ncooler winter months (December 1997 to February 1998),\nillustrates the lower evaporative demand during the winter\nbut, once net radiation and temperature increase from March\n1998, the cumulative gradient increases quickly. However,\ncumulative ET remains well below ETo and follows the same\npattern as cumulative rainfall. Daily ETo (Table 4) increased\nsteadily throughout the summer but decreased during May\nwhen rainfall and relative humidity were higher and global\nradiation decreased (Table 1).\nPHENOLOGY OF R. SPHAEROCARPA AND A.\nCYTISOIDES\nGrowth of A. cytisoides occurred mainly between January\nand March and flowering from March to the end of May.\nSenescence began in mid-June. The main growth of R.\nsphaerocarpa occurred during mid-March to the end of May\nand it flowered from the beginning of May to mid-June.\nThese results are consistent with previous results from other\nalluvial fans in the Rambla Honda (Puigdef\u00e1bregas et al., 1996).\nDiscussion\nLIMITATION OF RAINFALL AND ET\nThe gypsum blocks installed showed that the soil was dry\nbefore the cold season rainfall but that water infiltrated\nrelatively quickly after the first rainfall in September 1997.\nSoil water potential was low enough to cause draining,\nparticularly under shrubs, suggesting that water would have\ninfiltrated below the gypsum blocks. Gravimetric\nmeasurements of soil water content between 1 m and 2 m\nindicated that the soil at this depth was relatively dry; thus,\nby the time of the neutron probe measurements, the soil\nwater content was that remaining from the infiltration from\nthe September to December 1997 rainfall. From September\nto December 1997, Fig. 4 shows that drying took place at\n0.25 m to 1 m after the September storms, indicating that\nET occurred down to 1 m under shrubs and grass during the\ncold season.\nDuring the period of neutron probe measurements, the\nonly increase in soil water content followed the heavy\nrainfall in May but, in total, there was a net loss of soil\nwater for both sites (Table 4). Even though it rained in\nJanuary and February (Fig. 5), the continued loss of water\nfrom the soil profile at both sites probably reflected the rapid\ngrowth of grass and shrubs. Overall, ET exceeded rainfall\nover the measurement period, as shown in Table 4. All these\nresults indicate that the hypothesis can be rejected; according\nto this investigation, shrubs used all the available cold season\nrainfall.\nIn semi-arid areas, where evaporative demand is high,\nET is limited by rainfall and it is, therefore, expected that\nET and rainfall follow similar trends and remain well below\nETo (Fig. 6). That rainfall limits ET is common in dry\nenvironments such as the Mojave Desert (Yoder and Nowak,\n1999) and the semi-arid Mediterranean (Metochis and\nOrphanos, 1997; Pi\u00f1ol, et al., 1991).\nAnalysis of a 30-year rainfall record (1967-1997) near\nthe area of the Rambla Honda (L\u00e1zaro et al., 2001) shows\nthat the autumn rainfall of 1997 was above average and the\nwinter 1997 rainfall was average (the average being\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\n500.0\n600.0\n700.0\n23\n\/0\n1\/\n19\n98\n12\n\/0\n2\/\n19\n98\n04\n\/0\n3\/\n19\n98\n24\n\/0\n3\/\n19\n98\n13\n\/0\n4\/\n19\n98\n03\n\/0\n5\/\n19\n98\n23\n\/0\n5\/\n19\n98\n12\n\/0\n6\/\n19\n98\n02\n\/0\n7\/\n19\n98\nC\num\nm\nul\nat\ned\n w\nat\ner\n (m\nm\n)\nCumm ulated ETo\nCummulated ET\nCummulated Rainfall\nFig. 7.  Cumulative rainfall, ETo and average cumulative ET of the\nAnthyllis and Retama sites.\nNicole Archer, Tim Hess and John Quinton\n924\ncalculated over 30 years).The loss of all the available water\nfrom a relatively wet autumn and winter suggests that water\nwill seldom remain stored in the soil of these slopes by mid-\nsummer, except perhaps in much wetter years.\nINFILTRATION AND RUNOFF\nPrevious studies of shrub and grass root systems at these\ntwo sites have shown that the shrub root systems form larger,\ndeeper macro-pores than grass roots systems (Archer et al.,\n2002) and, hence, increase infiltration of water to deeper\ndepths. This would lower the soil water potential at all depths\nunder shrubs (Fig. 4) after the autumn storms in September\n1997 by comparison with the higher water potential under\ngrassed areas, as the lower density of macro-pores in grass\nareas would reduce infiltration of water to deeper depths.\nHowever, water did not penetrate beyond the rooting zone\nof R. sphaerocarpa and A. cytisoides, as the wetting fronts\ndid not infiltrate deeper than 2 m (Fig. 6). Vachaud et al.\n(1991) observed similar soil water profiles when using a\nneutron probe to measure the soil water profile of a cropped\ndegraded sandy soil in North Senegal.\nConsidering that the \u2018Retama\u2019 site has a greater gravel\nand lower silt content in the upper 1 m soil profile than the\n\u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site, it would be expected that infiltration of\nrainfall would be greater and runoff would be lower on the\n\u2018Retama\u2019 site. However, the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site has less average\nrunoff. The higher average runoff on the \u2018Retama\u2019 site is\nprobably because most this site is covered by grass and bare\nground (Fig. 1b), whereas the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site has a greater\ncover of shrubs (Fig. 1a). There are several explanations\nfor this: soil surface crusts found on the \u2018Retama\u2019 site would\ncause greater runoff rates (Hoogmoed et al., 1991); the\nhigher shrub density on the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site may promote\nthe greater infiltration under shrubs (Fig. 4) as A. cytisoides\nintercepts and channels 20% of gross rainfall as stem flow\nto the base of its roots (Domingo et al., 1998); dense shrub\ncover also produces more litter, which increases infiltration\nand reduces runoff. The large variations in runoff (Table 3)\nreflect the complexity of the two sites, where a mosaic of\ngrass, shrubs and bare patches dominates the redistribution\nof surface water. All the processes described here are likely\nto be active on the sites but with different relative\nimportance, both spatially and temporally, across the areas.\nLarge spatial variability of  soil water\ncontent and sampling technique of\nsoil water content\nThe large coefficient of variation of soil water content,\nparticularly on the \u2018Retama\u2019 site (Table 2) is due to the large\nspacing between grass and R. sphaerocarpa shrubs. This is\nconsistent with the results of Gaze et al. (1998); using\nneutron probe measurements in patchy vegetation dominated\nby Guiera senegalensis, they found a large spatial variability\nof soil water content. Figure 8 shows a possible reason for\nthis result. Assuming that infiltration, due to stem flow and\naccumulation of runoff is greatest around the base of a shrub,\nthe wettest area after rainfall would be around the base of\nthe shrub. The mid-zone, which is away from the base of\nthe shrub but under the shrub canopy, has the driest soil, as\nthe canopy intercepts most rainfall and reduces the amount\nof water reaching the ground. The mid-zone would also be\nunder the influence of shrub roots as it is nearer to the inner\nzone of the shrub. The outer zone would be drier than the\ninner zone, but wetter than the mid-zone, as the dry grass\nwill intercept less rainfall than the shrub canopy causing\nmore water to reach the soil than the mid-zone. The water\ncontent will, therefore, depend upon the exact positioning\nof the access tubes. At the shrub-area of the \u2018Retama\u2019 site,\nonly one access tube is positioned below the canopy of R.\nsphaerocarpa and the other five access tubes are\nsurrounding R. sphaerocarpa shrubs (Fig. 1b) so that they\nmay represent more the effect of the grass-area and the outer\nedge of R. sphaerocarpa than the shrub area. This could\nexplain the lower total water content measured in the\n\u2018Retama\u2019 shrub-area (Fig. 5). The gypsum blocks on the\nother hand showed greater differences between grass and\nshrub areas (Fig. 4), as they were installed directly under\nshrubs and outside in grass only areas.\nBy positioning access tubes within shrubs and others\noutside shrubs, Galle et al. (1999) observed that soil water\nstorage in a tiger bush thicket is greater in the core of the\nthicket than on the edges after rainfall; there was also less\nvariation between points within the core of the thicket and\npoints between the edges of the thicket. Further,\ninvestigation of different sampling techniques in\ndiscontinuous vegetation of R. sphaerocarpa and A.\ncytisoides might reduce the amount of variation in water\ncontent.\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nShrub position\nInner zone:\nWettest zone after\nrainfall\nMid-zone: Driest\nzone after rainfall\nOuter zone:\nMedium wet zone\nafter rainfall\nFig. 8. Diagrammatic representation of water distribution under a\nshrub after rainfall.\nThe water balance of two semi-arid shrubs on abandoned land in South-Eastern Spain after cold season rainfall\n925\nWATER AVAILABILITY FOR SHRUBS AND\nMARGINAL LAND MANAGEMENT\nThe large fluctuations in water potential at 0.25 m depth in\ngrassed areas (Fig. 4) are probably due to grass cover. Water\ninfiltrates rapidly to 0.25 m and then is quickly used by\ngrasses as their growth begins with the cold season rainfall\nto early spring. The main growth of A. cytisoides (January\nto March) occurred when soil water was relatively high in\nthe upper 2 m soil layer; due to its shallower rooting depths,\ngrowth is probably dependent on soil water storage in the\nupper soil layers. Also, A. cytisoides began to senesce once\nthe upper 1.5 m soil layer dried to 4% water content. In\ncontrast, the main growth period of R. sphaerocarpa (March\nto end May) does not coincide with availability of soil water\nin the upper soil layers, which suggests that R. sphaerocarpa\nmust find water in deeper layers to enable growth. The\nextensive root system of R. sphaerocarpa would facilitate\nthe uptake of water from deeper layers, enabling it to\ncontinue to function even during the dry season. The later\ngrowth of R. sphaerocarpa could also benefit from water\nrecharge of deeper soil layers from rainfall occurring earlier\nin the year. Both shrubs appear to have developed different\nmechanisms to harvest the scarce rainfall in this dry\nenvironment. A. cytisoides accumulates rainwater and runoff\nand directs it to lower soil layers and R. sphaerocarpa takes\nwater from deep soil layers, which may also be recharged\nfrom main runoff channels in the Rambla Honda.\nRunoff coefficients are very low for both sites, due to the\nlow rainfall, but also because the patchy ground cover\nintercepts and captures runoff. The low rainfall, the existence\nof flourishing shrubs within grass-areas, and little sign of\nerosion indicates that such a distribution of vegetation can\nutilise the available rainfall efficiently and stabilise the\nalluvial fan slopes.\nConclusion\nBefore the autumn rainfall, it was established that soil water\ncontent to 2 m depth was very low. With the first autumn\nrainfall in September, water infiltrated rapidly to 0.25 m\ndepth and after storms, water infiltrated rapidly to 1 m.\nDuring the cold season, ET did occur, due to drying of the\nsoil profile to 1 m, under grass and shrub cover. Even after\na relatively wet cold season, there was no measured gain of\nwater in the 2.75 m profile for the \u2018Retama\u2019 and \u2018Anthyllis\u2019\nsites over the measured period, which indicates that both\nshrubs did not store water in the soil profile by mid-summer.\nWater loss is controlled by high ET, runoff is low and soil\nwater storage occurs mainly above 2 m depth after rainfall.\nVariability of runoff and soil water content is high in this\nenvironment. The \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site had a higher ET and water\nstorage and water use was highest under A. cytisoides shrubs.\nOn the \u2018Retama\u2019 site, the shrub and grass areas had the same\nET. However, the grid system of access tubes may not\nmeasure, effectively, the influence of the dispersed\ndistribution of R. sphaerocarpa shrubs on soil water content,\nas access tubes were located mainly in the grass-area on the\n\u2018Retama\u2019 site. As the distribution of A. cytisoides shrubs\nwas less dispersed within the shrub area, the grid of access\ntubes detected a greater difference between the grass and\nshrub-areas of the \u2018Anthyllis\u2019 site.\nThis study shows that A. cytisoides and R. sphaerocarpa\nare well adapted to their environment. A. cytisoides harvests\nwater with its canopy and directs it to the upper soil layers\nwhere its roots are located. As water does not percolate\nbelow 2 m, virtually all the water infiltrating into the soil is\navailable to A. cytisoides. Its growth is, therefore, finely\ntuned to rainfall, as the growing season occurs when water\nis readily available. The low soil water content in the upper\n2.75 m soil layer would not sustain R. sphaerocarpa\nthroughout the year, so that R. sphaerocarpa must rely on\nits root system to access deep water resources.\nTo obtain representative soil water measurements beneath\nwidely distributed shrubs, a clumped distribution of access\ntubes may be better than the  widely spaced grid system of\nneutron probe access tubes used in this study.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been funded by the EC under its\nEnvironment Programme, contract number ENV4-CT95-\n0115 MEDALUS III (Mediterranean Desertification and\nLand Use Project) collaborative project.
