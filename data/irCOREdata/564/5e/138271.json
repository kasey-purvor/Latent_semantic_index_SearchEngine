Nevertheless,\ngroundwater quality is universally under threat and requires protection from a variety of point\nand non-point source (NPS) pollutants. In recognition of the importance of groundwater to\nsociety, many countries have produced methodologies that assess the vulnerability of\ngroundwater to NPS pollutants.\nFoster (1987) defined \u201caquifer pollution vulnerability\u201d as a measure of the protection afforded\nto an aquifer\u2019s saturated zone from vertical pollutant migration and the pollutant attenuation\ncapacity of the overlying strata and soils. Groundwater vulnerability maps, which zone the\n3land surface according to the likelihood of surface-derived pollutants reaching groundwater,\nhave been developed using a variety of ranking or scoring systems to produce qualitative (e.g.\nRobins et al. 1994; Geological Survey of Ireland 1999) or semi-qualitative (Secunda et al.\n1998; Fritch et al. 2000) output. Typically based on existing datasets, they represent an initial\nscreening to help early decision making by environmental managers, rather than providing an\nalternative to site-specific investigations.\nHowever, there has been little work carried out to test the validity of most groundwater\nvulnerability methodologies (Vrba and Zaporozec 1994). The principal exception is the\nDRASTIC model (Aller et al. 1987), which has been demonstrated to give a good relationship\nwith nitrate concentrations in groundwater (Navulur and Engel 1998; Secunda et al. 1998) but\na poor relationship with pesticide detections (Wade et al. 1998).\nThis paper describes a national scale validation of the groundwater vulnerability methodology\nof England and Wales (Environment Agency 1998) which was developed for use with pre-\nexisting datasets. The qualitative assessment concepts used in the methodology (Palmer et al.\n1995) have also been applied, slightly adapted to suit local soil and\/or geological conditions,\nin Lithuania (Holman et al. 2000) and The Philippines (Holman and Palmer 1998, 1999).\nVariations of the soil component of the methodology (the soil-leaching potential) are also\nused in Decision Support Systems for minimising agrochemical pollution (Brown et al. 2003;\nHolman et al. 2004). The aims of this paper are to assess whether an intrinsic vulnerability\nmethodology based on pre-existing national datasets can be successfully validated and to\nhighlight any wider implications for groundwater vulnerability mapping.\n4The UK groundwater vulnerability methodology\nThe development of the UK groundwater vulnerability concept and subsequent methodology\nis described by Robins et al. (1994). The methodology is unique in the way it integrates soil\nand geological properties, together with hydrogeology (Palmer et al. 1995), through the\nassessment of the properties of the unsaturated soil-drift-rock column. The main factors in\nthe assessment are:\n\uf0b7 The permeability of aquifer material within the unsaturated zone;\n\uf0b7 The presence of low permeability surficial drift deposits;\n\uf0b7 The presence and nature of overlying soil, as described by the Soil-leaching Potential;\nA three-fold aquifer classification is used, based on classifying units down to the first solid\ngeological formation. Whilst all groundwaters are afforded protection, regardless of whether,\nor how, they are currently used, it is convenient for strategic land use planning considerations\nto subdivide permeable strata into the categories of Major Aquifers and Minor Aquifers. Due\nto a greater propensity for fracturing and rapid fissure flow, Major Aquifers (such as the\nChalk and Sherwood Sandstone Group) have less capacity for attenuating contaminated\nrecharge entering at their surface than Minor Aquifers, such as the Carboniferous Coal\nMeasures and glaciofluvial sand and gravel deposits (Environment Agency 1998). Most\ngroundwater sources used for large-scale public water supply (PWS) are abstracted from\nMajor Aquifers. Low permeability strata (e.g. Mercia Mudstone Group) are classified as\nNon-Aquifers, even though sufficient water supplies for isolated dwellings are locally\navailable. Geological units occurring beneath the uppermost solid strata are never considered\nin the aquifer classification, even if they are Major or Minor Aquifers.\n5Low permeability surface drift deposits (such as boulder clay, clay-with-flints, estuarine\nalluvium) may afford some protection from potential pollutants. Their presence is depicted\non the maps only where they overlie areas classified as Minor or Major Aquifers. In the\nabsence of nationally available data on drift characteristics, 'low permeability drift' is\ngenerally not sub-divided according to its thickness or properties (although minor exceptions\nto this are described in Palmer et al. 1995). In other words, 5 m of 'low permeability drift\u2019\nwith a hydraulic conductivity of 0.01 m\/d is treated the same as 50 m with a hydraulic\nconductivity of 0.000001 m\/d. .\nThe Soil-Leaching Potential classification assesses the degree of protection afforded by the\nsoil layers to groundwater and is therefore only depicted on areas of Minor and Major\nAquifers. It is based on those physical and chemical soil properties that can affect\npermeability and chemical attenuation, such as soil thickness, parent material, texture, organic\ncarbon content, and the depth, duration and cause of waterlogging.\nThe soil-leaching potential classification has been validated at the site-specific scale using\nlarge (70 cm diameter) undisturbed soil lysimeters to measure the leaching of pesticide and\nbromide under a range of rainfall regimes (Brown et al. 2000). The use of lysimeter studies to\nvalidate a methodology which is designed to depict vulnerability at a larger scale is supported\nby studies comparing lysimeters and plot results (Fent et al. 1999) and lysimeter and field\nresults (Jene 1998). A limited validation exercise in Lithuania, based on groundwater\nsamples from 212 sites, demonstrated a link between soil-leaching potential and underlying\nnitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater (Holman et al. 2000). Nevertheless in order to\ndemonstrate the validity of this widely applied methodology it is necessary to show that it can\n6cope with the heterogeneity encountered in real systems at the regional scale for which this\nmethodology was intended.\nMethodology\nInput data\nNitrate represents the most widespread non-point source pollutant of groundwater in the UK.\nThe control of nitrate leaching has been, and will continue to be, an important legislative\nrequirement, with European Union instruments such as the Nitrates Directive (91\/676\/EEC)\n(CEC, 1991) and Water Framework Directive (2000\/60\/EC; Chave 2001) requiring limits on\nnitrate concentrations in groundwater. The Environment Agency, the regulatory body for\nmaintaining or improving the quality of waters in England and Wales, has developed a\nnational database of nitrate concentrations (expressed as mg\/L NO3-N) in groundwater, in\naccordance with the Nitrate Directive. This is based primarily from analyses from public\nwater supply (PWS) boreholes throughout all the regions of England and Wales.\nThe database (version 2.0), which contains between 1 and 3065 measurements of nitrate\nconcentration from each of 1108 boreholes as shown in Fig. 1, has been used as the validation\ndataset in this study. The mean nitrate concentrations at each borehole were calculated and\nshown to be normally distributed (Fig 2), allowing conventional parametric statistical\ntechniques to be used.\nTwo forms of independent variables were used to investigate the variation in the mean nitrate\nconcentrations (which represent the continuous dependent variable):\n\uf0b7 Categorical: all from the published groundwater vulnerability maps:\nAquifer class- Major, Minor and Non-Aquifer\n7Presence of low permeability drift at the surface- Yes \/ No\nSoil-leaching potential- High, Intermediate and Low.\n\uf0b7 Continuous:\nPotential soil moisture deficit (PSMD)- a 5 km x 5 km gridded dataset which gives a\nmeasure of the dryness of the climate (Jones and Thomasson 1985), which affects\nnitrogen mineralization and soil cracking;\nExcess Winter Rainfall (XWR)- a 5 km x 5 km gridded dataset which gives a measure\nof the excess of rainfall over evapotranspiration in the winter and hence an indication of\nthe proportion of rainfall available for recharge and solute movement (Smith 1976);\nLivestock nitrogen loading to land- a 5 km x 5 km gridded dataset calculated by\ncombining livestock numbers (total dairy cows, total pigs, etc.), derived from\ngovernment agricultural census data for 1988 with default values for excreted nitrogen\nper head of livestock (IPCC 1997);\nCrop nitrogen loading- a 5 km x 5 km gridded dataset calculated by combining arable\nand horticultural cropping statistics, derived from government agricultural census data\nfor 1988 with typical nitrogen application rates (MAFF 1994).\nWhile Tesoriero and Voss (1997) found that depth to groundwater and \/ or depth to the\nscreened interval in a well significantly influenced the probability of elevated nitrate levels in\ngroundwater, there is insufficient information available across UK aquifers to incorporate\nsuch factors in this analysis. In addition to nitrogen loading, the nitrogen pool available for\nleaching can be affected by land management practices such as ploughing (which increases\nthe mineralization opportunities- Vinten et al. 2002; Di 2002) and rotations (Allingham et al.\n2002). However, there is a lack of national data on land management practices which\n8precludes their inclusion in the analysis, although it is expected that the distribution and\nproportion of ploughed land will be related to the crop nitrogen loading dataset.\nApproach\nAt each borehole location, defined by the grid reference within the nitrate database, the\nrelevant soil, drift and aquifer classifications were extracted from the digital groundwater\nvulnerability maps using a point-in-polygon procedure within an ArcView GIS (Burrough and\nMcDonnell 1998). The same procedure was used to determine the continuous variable values\nfor each site.\nTwo statistical analyses were performed to establish whether the components of the intrinsic\ngroundwater vulnerability methodology are statistically significant in explaining the variation\nin mean groundwater nitrate concentration:\n1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is a statistical technique to test for significant\ndifferences between means by comparing variances (Snedecor and Cochran 1989). It tests\nfor whether the variation within the mean value of groundwater nitrate concentration for a\ncategorical variable class is significantly less than the variation between the mean values of\nthe different categorical variable classes.\nIn this study, for this analysis, the boreholes nominally located within Non-Aquifers were\nremoved (reducing the dataset to 930 boreholes), as soil-leaching potential and drift are not\ndefined in these areas. The ANOVA investigated whether the soil-leaching potential, drift\nand aquifer type (Major and Minor Aquifers only) explain a significant proportion of the\nvariability in the mean nitrate concentration at the boreholes.\n92. Analysis of Co-Variance (ANCOVA) is a technique that combines the features of Analysis\nof Variance and linear regression and allows for the effect of continuous variables on the\ndependent variable (mean nitrate concentration) whilst investigating the effect of the different\ncategorical variables.\nThe covariates (continuous variables) were not included in the initial (ANOVA) analysis as\nthere was insufficient data available to give a reasonable spread in the continuous variables\nand sufficient number of samples in some categorical variable classes (e.g. of aquifer type,\nsoil-leaching potential etc).\nIn this study the ANCOVA was used to investigate the effect of the aquifer class (including\nNon-Aquifer) on the mean nitrate concentration at the boreholes, after allowing for the effects\nof PSMD, XWR and crop and livestock nitrogen loadings which are expected to be related to\nthe mean nitrate concentration. It was also possible to investigate the significance of these\nrelationships. When performing ANCOVA it is important that the covariates ( PSMD, XWR,\ncrop and livestock nitrogen loadings) are independent of each other. In this study the four\ncovariates were obtained from different data sources and at different scales so it is anticipated\nthat any correlation between them is minimal\nIn all the analyses presented here any differences in means are \u2018significant\u2019 when the\nprobability (p) (under the null hypothesis that there are no significant differences between the\nmean nitrate concentrations of the categorical variable classes) of that difference occurring by\nchance is less than 0.05.\n10\nResults\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) for boreholes in areas of Major and Minor Aquifer\nThe results of the ANOVA are given in Table 1. Of the three categorical variables on the\ngroundwater vulnerability map (aquifer class, low permeability drift and soil-leaching\npotential), the only variable for which the mean nitrate concentrations are significantly\ndifferent is soil-leaching potential. The mean nitrate concentrations for boreholes through\nlow leaching potential soils (30.3 mg\/L) are significantly lower than for soils with either high\n(37.0 mg\/L) or intermediate (35.2 mg\/L) leaching potential (Fig. 3).\nThe analytical error for nitrate measurement in water is typically less than 1 mg\/L NO3-N\n(BSI 1999), although it would be anticipated that the analytical error would be randomly\ndistributed across the boreholes. Notwithstanding whether the analytical error confounds the\neffect being looked at or not, the differences are in all cases greater than the analytical error.\nIn addition to the significant differences associated with soil-leaching potential, there are\nsignificant interactions between the effects of soil-leaching potential, drift and aquifer class\non mean nitrate concentration, the key ones of which are discussed below. However, an\ninevitable problem in any spatially extensive groundwater vulnerability mapping\nmethodology which involves overlaying datasets of different scales, sources and\ninterpretation are mismatches. Although the following Figures show all combinations of\naquifer, drift and soil from the maps, there are certain combinations of drift and soil which\nrepresent differences in interpretation. The issue of mismatches is discussed later in the\npaper, but the combinations of Low soil-leaching potential without low permeability drift and\nHigh soil-leaching potential with low permeability drift represent fundamental mismatches in\n11\ninterpretation between the geological mapping and the soil mapping, for which a significant\nrelationship cannot be expected. The results described below focus on those relationships that\nrepresent true comparisons, rather than describing those which are the result of data\nmismatches.\nInteraction between soil-leaching potential and low permeability drift cover\n\uf0b7 Boreholes located in areas of Low leaching potential soils over low permeability drift\ncover (which are expected to provide maximum protection to underlying groundwater)\nhave a significantly lower mean nitrate concentration (25.3 mg\/L) than with any other\ncombination (Fig. 4);\n\uf0b7 In areas without low permeability drift cover, boreholes in areas with High leaching\npotential soils have a significantly higher mean nitrate concentration (36.8 mg\/L) than\nboreholes in areas with Intermediate leaching potential soils (33.2 mg\/L).\nHowever, boreholes in areas of Intermediate leaching potential soils developed in low\npermeability drift have a significantly higher mean nitrate concentration (45.8 mg\/L)\ncompared to those in areas of either Intermediate (33.2 mg\/L) or High (36.8 mg\/L) leaching\npotential soils developed in permeable material. This does not support the current\nvulnerability classification.\nInteraction between aquifer class and soil-leaching potential\nIn areas of low leaching potential soils, there is no significant difference in mean nitrate\nconcentration between Major or Minor Aquifers. However, in areas of more permeable soils\nthe mean nitrate concentrations in the more permeable Major Aquifers overlain by High and\nIntermediate leaching potential soils (38.5 and 38.7 mg\/L, respectively) are significantly\n12\nhigher than in Minor Aquifers overlain by the same leaching potential classes (33.0 and 26.9\nmg\/L, respectively).\nInteraction between aquifer class, soil-leaching potential and low permeability drift cover\nThe inclusion of aquifer class in Fig. 5 reinforces the significant relationships previously\nobserved between soil-leaching potential and presence of low permeability drift, ignoring the\nmismatches previously identified.\nAnalysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for all boreholes\nTable 2 shows the results of the ANCOVA. Of the covariates only PSMD and livestock\nloading explained a significant amount of variation. After allowing for the influence of the\ncovariates on nitrate concentrations, aquifer class has a significant effect on mean nitrate\nconcentrations. All comparisons between the mean nitrate concentrations for the different\naquifer classes in Fig. 6 are significant. The mean value for Major Aquifers was 37.9 mg\/L,\nfor Minor Aquifers 30.5 mg\/L and Non-Aquifers 33.8 mg\/L.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the ANOVA have largely supported the intrinsic groundwater vulnerability\nmethodology for use in national and regional applications. However, the analysis has\nhighlighted a number of limitations which are pertinent to the application of most intrinsic\nvulnerability methodologies.\nDepiction of aquifer classes and their vertical sequence\nIn order to provide unambiguous maps that can be used by non-specialists, simplification of\nthe natural complexity had to be incorporated in the UK vulnerability maps. The aquifer\n13\nclassification therefore either shows the uppermost solid geological formation (if it is\nclassified as an aquifer) or, where this is classified as a Non-Aquifer, the map shows the\nuppermost permeable drift unit. Where low permeability drift overlies a Non-Aquifer, this is\nshown as a Non-Aquifer, even where the Non-Aquifer may overly a Major or Minor Aquifer.\nThe sub-division of geological formations into Major, Minor and Non-Aquifers is largely\nsupported by the analysis. The highly significant difference between the mean nitrate\nconcentration in Major Aquifer boreholes compared to those in Minor Aquifers is consistent\nwith the higher permeability in Major Aquifers and the potential for rapid transport of\nrecharge (and solutes) to the water table. The difference may also represent the effects of\ngreater dilution within the more heterogeneous and dispersive groundwater systems (Pang et\nal. 2000) of Minor Aquifers.\nThe treatment of areas classified on the maps as Non-Aquifers is more complex, because of\ntheir potential dual roles in water resource protection and supply. Although the boreholes\nused in this study within areas designated as Non-Aquifers will be abstracting from\nunderlying aquifers, no distinction is made on the maps between such areas and areas of\ngenerally low permeability (e.g. the areas of Lower Palaeozoic and Precambrian rocks in\nnorthwest England and Wales).\nIn a hydrogeological setting characterised by a Non-Aquifer overlying an important aquifer,\nbut which is depicted on the vulnerability maps as a Non-Aquifer, the overlying Non-Aquifer\ncan influence groundwater quality in the underlying aquifers. The lower mean nitrate\nconcentrations in the boreholes penetrating Non-Aquifers compared to those depicted as\nMajor Aquifers may suggest that the overlying Non-Aquifer is either limiting the downward\n14\nmovement of nitrate-rich recharge to the deep groundwater or providing a suitable\nenvironment for denitrification (Feast et al. 1998), or that partial denitrification is occurring in\nthe confined portion of the aquifer (Moncaster et al. 2000). That the mean nitrate\nconcentration is greater than that in Minor Aquifers suggests that in many cases these\nprocesses are incomplete, that some of the underlying aquifers are unconfined or that nitrate-\nrich unconfined groundwater is being drawn into confined or semi-confined portions of the\naquifer as a result of high pumping rates.\nThe Water Framework Directive requires the input of pollutants to all groundwater to be\nprevented or limited, regardless of whether they are used for public water supply. There are\nmany small groundwater sources used for private supply in Non-Aquifer deposits which offer\nan important social and economic asset to isolated rural communities (Robins 1999). They\nare currently not protected by the zoning on the maps.\nThe next generation of groundwater protection tools needs to indicate the vertical succession\nof units (for example as depicted on CEC 1982) so that Non-Aquifers can be zoned in the\nsame way as Minor and Major Aquifers for water supply purposes, while at the same time\nrecognising their role in influencing the quality of groundwater in deeper aquifers.\nMismatches arising from the map scales used and interpretation of input data\nIn applying groundwater vulnerability methodologies, the usual procedure is to use the best\navailable data, rather than to use data at the smallest common map scale. For example, within\nthe UK groundwater vulnerability maps, the scale of the geological information ranges from\n1:10,000 to 1:250,000 (mostly at 1:50,000) while that of the soil information ranges from\n15\n1:25,000 to 1:250,000 (mostly at 1:250,000 scale), depending upon location. All are depicted\non the published map at 1:100,000 scale with simplification and amalgamation where\nnecessary. As a result, there are inevitable discrepancies in interpreting the groundwater\nvulnerability maps between the geological and soil data (Palmer et al. 1995). About 9% of\nthe boreholes examined in the ANOVA (i.e. in areas of Major or Minor Aquifers only) were\nin locations in which the soil parent material at 1 m depth suggest a mismatch with the\ngeological data. For example, 49 boreholes are in locations where the map shows soils of\nLow leaching potential, which by definition must have low permeability subsoils, overlying\nan aquifer without a covering of low permeability drift and 34 boreholes are in locations\nwhere the map shows permeable soils of High leaching potential and a covering of low\npermeability drift.\nIt is important that users of regional vulnerability maps are aware of the inevitable use of\nmapping input data at different scales, the combinations of input data which represent\nmismatches and the procedures to employ when this occurs. Without this information (e.g.\nPalmer et al. 1995), users may inadvertently make incorrect decisions when using such maps.\nPollutant pathways through the soil \/ drift column\nIgnoring the soil-drift combinations representing soil\/geology mismatches as described above\n(and in Palmer et al. 1995), Fig. 4 shows that the mean nitrate concentration, for the four most\nprobable combinations of presence\/ absence of low permeability drift and soil-leaching\npotential, increases in the following order:\n\uf0b7 Presence of low permeability drift with Low soil-leaching potential\n\uf0b7 Absence of low permeability drift with Intermediate soil-leaching potential\n16\n\uf0b7 Absence of low permeability drift with High soil-leaching potential\n\uf0b7 Presence of low permeability drift with Intermediate soil-leaching potential\nThe first three combinations, which are in the anticipated order, are all significantly different.\nThis supports the view that the boreholes in the best protected areas will generally be located\nwhere Low leaching potential soils overlie low permeability drift deposits and that boreholes\nlocated in areas where High leaching potential soils overlie permeable material (which will\ncharacterise most areas of shallow or sandy soils over aquifer outcrop) are afforded much less\nprotection.\nIt could be argued that the latter results might be due to there being more ploughed land or\nhigher nitrate loadings on thick, well drained soils which characterise many of the areas of\nintermediate or high leaching potential overlying aquifers. For example, recommended\nfertiliser application rates for cereals are typically greater on sandy soils than clay soils\n(MAFF 1994). However, that a similar relationship is observed between aquifer class and\nmean nitrate concentration in both the ANOVA and ANCOVA, indicates that intrinsic\nproperties can have a demonstrable effect on mean nitrate concentration, having allowed for\nthe effects of the continuous variables. This is supported by the analysis of Loveland (1998)\nwhich showed that soil type alone is a poor predictor - nationally or regionally - of farming\npractice and vice versa.\nAlthough the first three combinations above are in the anticipated order, the results for\nIntermediate leaching potential soils in low permeability drift suggest that there is an aspect of\nnitrate movement through these areas which presently is not adequately catered for in the\ncurrent groundwater vulnerability methodology.\n17\nAs a generalization, the typical resolution of the drift geological mapping data (1:50,000\nscale) used in the production of the groundwater vulnerability maps is better than the soil\ninformation (1:250,000 scale). Nevertheless the ANOVA has suggested that soil information\non its own is a better determinant of mean nitrate concentration than drift geology as currently\nmapped on the groundwater vulnerability maps. In the production of the groundwater\nvulnerability maps, each soil type is classified into a soil-leaching potential class based upon\ndefined diagnostic properties (Hodgson 1997; Avery 1980) which influence water and solute\nmovement, measured or observed in the field at the time of the original soil mapping. This\nallows different soil types developed in the same drift type to be assigned to different soil-\nleaching potential classes based upon observations and measurements. However, in the case\nof the geological information each drift deposit is classified by expert judgement wholly into\neither low permeability drift or permeable drift. Swartz et al. (2003) demonstrate that the\nassumption that till deposits are sufficiently homogeneous to be represented by a single\npermeability classification is an oversimplification.\nIt is possible therefore that the \u2018low permeability\u2019 drift deposits beneath Intermediate leaching\npotential soils are different from those beneath Low leaching potential soils, as indicated by\nthe evidence of relatively short duration of soil wetness in Intermediate leaching potential\nsoils compared to the prolonged waterlogging of Low leaching potential soils. A number of\nmechanisms may potentially increase the downward flux of water and solutes through these\npermeable so-called \u2018low permeability\u2019 drift deposits. Vertical gravel-filled dykes, as found\nin till in Ireland (Rijsdijk 1999), which are interpreted as the infillings of fractures can provide\nvery permeable routes through otherwise impermeable layers. Weathered Quaternary\naquitards (till, glaciolacustrine, and loess deposits) in North America were found to have\n18\ngreatly reduced ability to attenuate nitrate and pesticides, compared to unweathered\nQuaternary aquitards (Rodvang and Simpkins, 2001). This was ascribed to reduced sulfur\nand sorptive\/labile organic carbon, and a higher bulk hydraulic conductivity due to fractures.\nFinally, macropore \/ preferential \/ dual porosity flow in till can also occur, the importance of\nwhich has been recognised for general contaminant transport (Scanlon et al. 2002). For\nexample, Jorgensen and Fredericia (1992) observed dual porosity in the upper 10 m of a\nfractured clayey till, and rapid leaching in the macropore structure. Clay-rich Intermediate\nleaching potential soils, developed in the \u2018same\u2019 parent material as Low leaching potential\nsoils, would be anticipated to be more prone to by-pass flow arising from increased cracking\nas they will start to dry out more quickly in summer than the Low leaching potential soils and\nattain greater soil moisture deficits so that maximum cracking will be achieved earlier, more\noften and for longer periods. This analysis has shown that the presence or absence of low\npermeability drift as a measure of the protection afforded to groundwater by drift deposits\nneeds improving. In the absence of nationally available spatial data on the hydraulic\nproperties of drift, it is considered that further investigation of the integration of soil and\ngeological information as an indicator of drift properties is merited.\nAlthough the importance of preferential flow to leaching of bromide (Aderhold and\nNordmeyer 1995), pesticides (Brown et al. 2000) and nitrate (Bergstr\u00f6m and Johansson 1991;\nStout et al. 1998) through soil been demonstrated in lysimeter studies, its incorporation into\ngroundwater vulnerability methodologies is limited (e.g DRASTIC; Holman et al. 2004). No\nattempts to date have been made to incorporate preferential flow through non-karstified\ngeological material in any groundwater vulnerability methodology.\n19\nPreferential flow in cracking or shrinking clay soils is relatively easily incorporated, as in\nDRASTIC, but it occurs in geological formations and in a much wider variety of soil types\n(Brown et al. 2000) and can be altered by land management practices (Mori et al. 1999;\nHangen et al. 2002). The incorporation of these somewhat less predictable conduits of\npreferential flow into groundwater vulnerability methodologies represents a significant, but\nimportant, challenge.\nPollutant loading\nThe current groundwater pollution vulnerability assessment for the UK is based on\nclassification of intrinsic properties of combined soil and aquifer layers. Validation of these\ntypes of classification using a single pollutant such as nitrate is problematical because any\nvalidation introduces factors that are temporally, as well as spatially, variable. Thus the\npresence of nitrate in groundwater will depend on the amount and timing of surface loadings,\nsoil nitrate levels particularly in the late autumn (Di and Cameron 2002) and their\nrelationships to climatic factors such as rainfall and PSMD. For example, relatively high\nrainfall to dilute surplus nutrients, combined with year-round moist soils (low PSMD) with an\nactive bacterial population, can ensure generally low nitrate concentrations (Robins 1998).\nTo better represent the relationships controlling nitrate (and other pollutants) in groundwater,\nthe results of this validation suggests that the next generation of groundwater protection tools\nshould focus more on risk-based approaches. Dynamic factors such as surface pollutant\nloading and climatically or biologically dependent degradation potential should be integrated\nwith intrinsic characteristics such as soil-leaching potential and aquifer hydrogeology (e.g.\nHolman et al. 2004; Lovett et al. 2001). In developing such national scale risk-based\n20\napproaches, techniques based on physically-based relationships or metamodels may be\npreferable, as they can account for system non-linearities such as between recharge volume\nand pollutant concentration (e.g. Lord and Anthony 2000; Holman et al. 2004).\nConclusions\nThe qualitative assessment concepts used in the intrinsic groundwater pollution vulnerability\nmethodology for England and Wales have been widely applied, both in the UK and overseas.\nThe methodology, based on combining existing spatial datasets of soil and geological\nproperties, is largely supported by a validation using a national database of nitrate\nconcentrations from 1107 boreholes throughout England and Wales. However, the analysis\nhas highlighted a number of limitations which are shared by most intrinsic vulnerability\nmethodologies.\nThe Water Framework Directive requires all groundwaters in the European Union to be\nprotected from pollution, including those in geological materials currently designated as Non-\nAquifers. Groundwater protection tools will need to indicate the vertical succession of\ngeological units, so that Non-Aquifers can be zoned in the same way as Minor and Major\nAquifers for water supply purposes, while at the same time recognising their role in\ninfluencing the quality of groundwater in deeper aquifers.\nThe high mean nitrate concentrations associated with Intermediate leaching potential soils in\nlow permeability drift suggest that there is an aspect of nitrate movement which presently is\nnot currently adequately catered for. An Analysis of Variance has suggested that soil\ninformation is a better determinant of mean nitrate concentration than drift geology as\n21\ncurrently mapped on the groundwater vulnerability maps. It is considered that this arises\nbecause the soil classification is based upon properties measured or observed in the field,\nrather than by the expert judgement currently used to assess the influence of drift geology.\nThe development of intrinsic vulnerability methodologies based upon defined diagnostic\nproperties for both soil and drift, and the incorporation of preferential flow characteristics of\ngeological formations, soil types and land management practices represent significant, but\nimportant, future challenges for groundwater vulnerability methodologies.\nAlthough the intrinsic vulnerability classification has been demonstrated to be statistically\nsignificant in explaining the variation in mean nitrate concentrations, the importance of\npollutant loading cannot be overlooked. Opportunities presented by legislation to update\ngroundwater protection tools should be taken, in order to develop more dynamic assessments\nof pollutant risk to groundwater which incorporate these features.\nReferences\nAderhold D, Nordmeyer H (1995).
