We hypothesized that they would identify individuals at increased risk of \ncomplications and mortality following major emergency non-cardiac surgery. \nForty patients were studied with a primary end-point of a new post-operative \ncardiac event, and\/or development of significant ECG changes, and\/or cardiac \ndeath. The main secondary outcome was all cause mortality at 6 months. Pre-\noperative BNP levels were higher in 11 patients who suffered a new post-\noperative cardiac event (p=0.001) and predicted this outcome with an area \nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (CI=0.72-0.98, \np=0.001). A pre-operative BNP value >170pg.ml-1 has a sensitivity of 82% and a \nspecificity of 79% for the primary end-point. In this small study, pre-operative \nBNP levels identify patients undergoing major emergency non-cardiac surgery \nwho are at increased risk of early post-operative cardiac events. Larger studies \nare required to confirm these data. \nWord count -148 \n \n \nKEYWORDS \nB-type natriuretic peptide, non-cardiac surgery, emergency surgery, risk \nstratification \n 4 \nMajor emergency surgery is associated with high levels of morbidity and morbidity [1,2]. The \nmortality from emergency laparotomy in the UK may be as high as 25% [3] and in our \nhospital carries a 12% risk of death [4]. Likewise, major emergency hip surgery is associated \nwith a mortality of 9% at 30 days and 22% at 120 days [5]. Mortality in this setting may relate \nto the effects of the underlying condition or to direct effects of surgery. However, the majority \nof patients die due to the development of major cardiac complications in the early post-\noperative period [1,2].  \n \nAccurate pre-operative risk stratification is important for several reasons. It \nallows clinicians to explain and quantify risk and, thus, is an essential component \nin gaining informed consent. Perhaps more importantly, accurate identification of \npatients at highest risk might allow targeting of interventions that may improve \noutcome in elective or emergency surgery, such as peri-operative beta blockade \nand pre-operative optimisation [6-8]. Predicting outcome in emergency surgery \nis, however, difficult - particularly as existing risk assessment tools were \ndeveloped and evaluated in patients undergoing major elective non-cardiac \nsurgery and may lack accuracy in predicting the development of cardiac \ncomplications in others settings [6,9-11]. In addition, alternate methods of \nassessing cardiovascular risk - such as stress testing and\/or echocardiography - \nmay be impractical or difficult. The availability of a readily available 'biomarker' \nthat might assist with risk stratification would, therefore, be of particular value in \nthis situation. \n \nB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted chiefly from the left ventricle in \nresponse to filling pressure and volume load. It promotes natriuresis, diuresis \nand vasodilatation [12]. Blood concentrations of BNP are raised in patients with \n 5 \ncardiac disease, particularly those with heart failure, though also in response to \nischaemia. They are important markers of cardiovascular prognosis in many \nsettings [13,14]. In particular, recent research suggests that pre-operative BNP \nlevels are predictive of post-operative cardiac complications in patients following \ncoronary artery bypass grafting [15,16]. They may also have a place in risk \nprediction before major elective non-cardiac surgery [17-20]. The utility of BNP \nin the risk stratification of patients undergoing emergency surgery has not, \nhowever, been previously tested. We hypothesised that pre-operative BNP would \npredict peri-operative myocardial events and \/ or death after surgery in patients \nundergoing major emergency non-cardiac surgery.  \n \nMETHODS \nThe research protocol was approved by the local research ethics committee and \nwritten informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was a \nprospective single centre observational cohort study of consecutive patients \nundergoing emergency major non-cardiac surgery. Major emergency non-cardiac \nsurgery was defined as emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal pathology and \nemergency hip surgery for fractured neck of femur. Emergency surgery was \ndefined as surgery that requires to be performed within 24 hours of presentation.  \nPre-operative BNP sampling was undertaken after completion of pre-operative \nfluid and electrolyte resuscitation immediately before surgery.  \n \nData collection \nPre-operative data collection included the recording of a 12 lead \nelectrocardiogram (ECG), patient demographics, medical and surgical history, \npre-operative medications, renal and hepatic function. Pre-operative blood \n 6 \nsamples were also obtained for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and plasma BNP levels. \nThe Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), American Society Anesthesiology (ASA) \nscore, pre-morbid New York Heart Association functional class and Canadian \nCardiovascular Society angina score were calculated. Intra-operative data \ncollection included details of surgery and anaesthesia, cardiac and non-cardiac \ncomplications and intra-operative inotrope requirement. Post-operative data \ncollection included the recording of a 12 lead ECG and measurement of cTnI \nlevels at 24 and 72 hours after surgery. Patients were followed-up while in \nhospital and vital status determined at 6 months using data provided by the \nGeneral Register Office for Scotland. \n \nAll patients were followed up by an investigator who was unaware of the \npatient\u2019s biochemistry results and ECG outcomes. Electrocardiograms were \nanalyzed by a consultant cardiologist blinded to all other data including the \npatient\u2019s clinical status and their biochemistry results. Clinicians responsible for \nthe patients\u2019 care were blinded to the ECG and cTnI results that were obtained \nfor research purposes. They were blinded to BNP results at all times.  \n \nStudy end-points  \nThe primary endpoint was the predictive power of BNP for a major adverse post \noperative cardiac event. This was defined as: cardiac death during the index \nadmission and\/or new post-operative myocardial injury (cTnI \u22650.1ng.ml-1 at 24 \nand\/or 72 hours with undetectable pre-operative levels) and\/or the development \nof clinically significant new post-operative ECG changes, within 72 hours of \nsurgery. \n \n 7 \nWe have used the terminology myocardial \u2018injury\u2019 instead of \u2018infarction\u2019 as the \nlatter is difficult to define in this setting [21-29]. For the purposes of this study \nacute peri-operative myocardial injury was defined as evidence of myocardial cell \nnecrosis (cTnI \u22650.1ng.ml-1 \u2013 the local lower limit of detection of the assay used). \nClinically significant ECG changes were prospectively defined as- \na) the development of changes suggestive of significant acute myocardial \nischemia \/ infarction: the development of new, post-operative, T-wave \ninversion \u22652mm and \/ or ST segment deviation \u22652mm in at least two-\ncontiguous chest leads or 1mm in at least two contiguous limb leads and \/ or  \nb) the development of new sustained abnormal cardiac rhythm within 72 hours \nof surgery. \n \nThe following secondary end-points were also assessed: \na) new post-operative myocardial injury (defined as above), within 72 hours of \nsurgery \nb) any post-operative myocardial injury (cTnI \u22650.1ng.ml-1 at 24 and\/or 72 hours \nregardless of pre-operative levels) \nc) all-cause mortality 6 months after surgery \n \nAssays \nBlood was collected in EDTA and lithium heparin Vacutainer\u2122 tubes, which were \nthen immediately centrifuged with plasma stored at \u201380\u00b0C for later analysis. \nPrior to the pre-operative blood sample, patients were asked to lie quietly in the \nsupine position for 30 minutes in order to eliminate any possible confounding \neffects of posture and exercise on plasma BNP levels. BNP and cTnI assays were \nmeasured using the Bayer ADVIA Centaur\u2122 immunoassay analyser [30,31]. The \n 8 \nlower limit of detection for BNP is 2pg.ml-1 and the coefficients of variation at \n29.4pg.ml-1 and 410pg.ml-1 are 4.7% and 2.8% respectively [30,31].  \n \nStatistics  \nData was analysed on Statistics Package for Social SciencesTM 12 software. \nCategorical data are presented as absolute values and percentages. Normally \ndistributed continuous variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation, \nwhile those with a skewed distribution are expressed as median and interquartile \nrange. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to test differences between independent \ncategorical data. Differences between two independent groups of continuous data \nwere tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver Operating Characteristic \ncurves were plotted and the area under the curve estimated. Backward \nconditional logistic regression analysis was used to test the independent \npredictive value of elevated BNP levels. A p value <0.05 was considered \nsignificant. \n \nRESULTS \nFifty-eight patients met inclusion criteria for the study and were invited to \nparticipate. Forty-six patients (79%) consented to the study and 40 underwent \nsurgery and completed the trial protocol. Baseline data are presented in table 1.  \n \nThe median pre-operative BNP level was 100pg.ml-1 (62-205), rising at 24 hours \nto 157pg.ml-1 (82-225: p=0.07 v baseline) and falling by 72 hours post-\noperatively to 72pg.ml-1 (41-167: p=0.001 v baseline). Fifteen patients had \ndetectable (\u22650.1ng.ml-1) levels of cTnI pre-operatively. In six of these subjects \nlevels fell below 0.1ng.ml-1 post-operatively, whereas an additional 5 patients \n 9 \nexhibited de novo elevation. Six further patients developed significant new \nchanges on their post-operative ECG(s). One patient died 4 days after surgery \ndue to acute myocardial infarction, there were no other deaths within the first 28 \ndays. A further 5 patients died during follow-up, resulting in a total of 6 deaths \n(15%) at 6 months. \n \nPre-operative BNP levels in patients were significantly higher among patients \nwho experienced a post-operative cardiac event (table 1 and figure 1). Patients \nwho exhibited new post-operative myocardial damage (elevation of cTnI \n\u22650.1ng.ml-1 at 24 and\/or 72 hours with normal pre-operative levels: n=5) had a \nmedian pre-operative BNP of 201pg.mL-1 (135-407) compared to 88pg.mL-1 (59-\n194) in patients without de novo cTnI release (p=0.07). Likewise, median pre-\noperative BNP levels among patients with any post-operative myocardial damage \n(cTnI \u22650.1ng.ml-1 at 24 and\/or 72 hours regardless of pre-operative levels: \nn=14) were 214pg.mL-1 (89-433) compared to 83pg.mL-1 (52-144; p=0.005) \namong those patients who did not have any cTnI elevation after surgery. \n \nMedian pre-operative BNP levels were 196 pg.mL-1 [96-296] in the 6 patients \nwho died during 6 month follow-up (v 88pg.mL-1 [57-201] among survivors: \np=0.10). Pre-operative cTnI levels were 0.00ng.mL-1 [0.00-0.13] in surviving \npatients (v 0.1ng.mL-1 [0.00-0.52] in those that died) (p=0.38). However, \nneither elevated (\u22650.1 ng.ml-1) pre-operative or post-operative cTnI levels \npredicted 6-month mortality (p=0.65 for both). \n \nPre-operative BNP predicted the primary outcome with an area under the \nreceiver operator characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-\n 10 \n0.98, p=0.001). The optimal cut-point derived from this curve was 170pg.ml-1. \nThis has a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 79% (Figure 2). Pre-operative \nBNP levels \u2265170pg.mL-1 predicted the primary outcome with an odds ratio (OR) \nof 17.3 (95% CI 2.9-101.9, p=0.002). \n \nRelative utility of BNP and existing risk prediction scores \nPatients with an RCRI of 1 or 2 had a BNP of 83pg.mL-1 (56\u2013191) compared to \n195pg.mL-1 (121\u2013466: p=0.02) in those with a RCRI of 3 and 4. Likewise, \npatients with ASA scores of 1 and 2 had a median BNP of 83pg.mL-1 (63\u2013154) \ncompared to 183pg.mL-1 (60\u2013356: p=0.12) in those with an ASA score of 3 to 5. \n \nWhen pre-operative BNP levels (as a continuous variable) were included in a \nmultivariable model along with the pre-operative ASA score and the RCRI the \nonly independent predictor of the primary outcome was the ASA score (OR 4.78 \nper unit increase, 95% CI 1.48-15.39, p=0.009). There was, however, a trend \nfor BNP to provide additional independent prognostic information (OR 1.04 per \n10pg.mL-1 increase, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, p=0.07). In a second model including the \nASA score, the RCRI and BNP levels dichotomised around the optimal cut-off, the \nindependent predictors were BNP \u2265170pg.mL-1 (OR 13.6, 95% CI 1.9-97.8, \np=0.009) and the RCRI (OR 2.8 per unit increase, 95% CI 1.2-6.9, p=0.02).\n 11 \nDISCUSSION \nPatients undergoing major emergency surgery are at high risk of peri-operative \ncardiovascular complications. However, within this population the magnitude of \nthis hazard will vary. Paradoxically, these patients are least likely to undergo \nformal risk-stratification. This, at least in part, reflects the imperative for surgery \nand the absence of evidence-based interventions to reduce complications. It may \nalso be due to the difficulty in performing specialist investigations, plus the lack \nof well-validated and easily applied methods of estimating risk in this setting. \nSome of these reasons, in turn, reflect the paucity of research in such acutely ill-\npatients - who are less easy to identify and enrol into trials than those \nundergoing elective surgery. \n \nThe current study suggests that pre-operative BNP levels are higher in patients \nwho suffer an early post-operative cardiac event and may provide prognostic \ninformation that is incremental to existing methods of risk-prediction such as the \nASA score and the RCRI. Pre-operative BNP also shows a trend towards \npredicting 6-month mortality.  \n \nPrior studies \nThere are no prior data addressing the role of BNP in predicting outcome from \nemergency non-cardiac surgery. However, several recent reports have suggested \nthat BNP or N terminal pro-BNP levels are useful in pre-operative risk-\nstratification in elective non-cardiac surgery [17-19]. In this setting BNP and N \nterminal pro-BNP identify patients at risk of per-operative myocardial damage \nand heart failure. In addition, BNP predicts medium term mortality in this group \n[20]. There is also a growing body of literature suggesting a prognostic role for \n 12 \nBNP and its derivatives at the time of cardiac surgery [15,16]. In contrast, the \nrole of BNP in predicting risk associated with critical illness is less clear [32-34]. \n \nThere are a variety of mechanisms whereby BNP might predict risk in this \nsetting. BNP is often considered a global marker of cardiac function or health. In \npatients with symptomatic heart disease natriuretic peptide levels are markers of \nincreased myocardial stress, usually from volume and pressure overload but also \nin response to hypoxia and ischaemia [35,36]. Levels of BNP predict cardiac \nevents, such as incident myocardial infarction and death, in many settings - \nincluding patients with heart failure, stable coronary heart disease and even in \napparently healthy populations [14]. Many patients presenting for major surgery \nmay have clinical or subclinical cardiac failure or ischaemic heart disease. Pre-\noperative BNP levels will reflect their underlying cardiovascular status, identifying \nthose with a reduced cardiac reserve - who present a greater risk of peri-\noperative myocardial infarction and early and late mortality [37-39].  \n \nOther methods of risk stratification \nThe practicalities of risk-stratification in emergency surgery have been \nmentioned above. Existing risk prediction scores such as the ACC\/AHA and \nRevised Cardiac Risk Index have limited clinical utility and are not commonly \napplied in everyday practice [9-11]. Further, these scores may have a limited \nrole in emergency surgery patients as they have been derived in cohorts \nundergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery. Given these limitations, a rapid \nand relatively cheap biochemical test, potentially available by near patient \ntesting, with a clearly defined cut point, would be of considerable clinical utility.   \n \n 13 \nLimitations \nThis was a small study with limited power. In addition, the requirement to gain \ninformed consent meant that patients with low mental state questionnaire scores \nwere excluded. As these patients often have the highest operative risk, this may \nhave introduced a degree of bias into our sample. Acute illness and fluid \nimbalance may also affect BNP levels. We attempted to allow for this by \nmeasuring BNP after pre-operative resuscitation was complete. However this \ntime point is imprecise and the exact fluid status of the patient at time of \nsampling is uncertain. Finally, our cohort is heterogenous - including patients \nundergoing major emergency abdominal and hip surgery. Nevertheless, if BNP \nlevels were to prove clinically useful they would have to demonstrate sensitivity \nand specificity in such diverse clinical situations. \n \nIn a small study we were able to show that elevated pre-operative BNP levels \nwere associated with an increased risk of early post-operative cardiac events in \npatients undergoing major emergency non-cardiac surgery. Further work is \nrequired to clarify the role of BNP in this setting. \n 14 \nAcknowledgement \nGemma Card is supported by a Health Foundation Student Research Fellowship. \nWe acknowledge the support of the doctors and nurses of the surgical units in \nAberdeen Royal infirmary that helped in the conduct of this trial.  \n \nThe Health Services Research Unit is core funded by the Chief Scientists Office of \nthe Scottish Executive Health Department.
