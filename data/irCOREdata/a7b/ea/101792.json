INTRODUCTION\nThin amorphous carbon films have attractive mechani-\ncal, optical, electrical, and tribological properties, and oc-\ncupy an important place due to their wide industrial applica-\ntions as thin film protective coatings.1 Hydrogenated\namorphous carbon, a-C:H, is a useful material because of\nthe possibility to vary the bonding configurations of the car-\nbon atoms and to decrease film internal stresses.2,3 These\nproperties of amorphous carbon films, which include hydro-\ngenated diamond-like carbon ~DLHC!, may be modified by\nvarying the deposition technology and\/or by means of the\nintroduction of various impurities during deposition or\nthrough implantation of ions after growth.4\u20137 The common\nfeature of these films is the C bonding degeneracy, leading to\nthe various concentration of nondiamond ~mainly sp2)\nbonded carbon. This fact has a significant influence not only\non the film structure but also on the film electronic properties\nsuch as the width of the band gap and the density of states in\nit8 and consequently to the electric transport and optical\nproperties.9 As a rule, the spin density in the band gap is\noften more then 1018 cm23 in the a-C films10 and results in\npinning of the Fermi level thus making it difficult to change\nelectronic properties by doping.\nAmong the few methods of analyzing electron defect\nstates, electron spin resonance ~ESR! is a powerful direct\nmethod to the study of unpaired electron states in solids and\nhas been employed in the study of amorphous carbon films\nproduced by different methods.6,9\u201316 It provides important\na!Electronic mail: IIyanchuk@yahoo.com5900021-8979\/2003\/93(10)\/5905\/6\/$20.00\nDownloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tinformation about the spin density and nature of unpaired\nelectrons in the films, their spin\u2013spin and spin-lattice inter-\nactions, and linking of these parameters with films\nmicrostructure.9 In this article, we analyze the features of the\nESR signal behavior in both nitrogenated and nitrogen-free\nW and Ni implanted a-C:H films. Visible Raman scattering\nmeasurements are also used to clarify the correlation be-\ntween structure features and paramagnetic state properties.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe a-C:H films were deposited using a commercial rf\n~13.56 MHz! plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition\n~PECVD! system. The films were grown on the earthed elec-\ntrode using CH4 and He as feed gases onto high resistivity Si\n~100! ~10\u2013100 V cm!. Deposition on the earthed electrode\nresults in a low negative self bias of ~,20 V! and results in\npolymeric a-C:H films with a high optical gap ~2.6 eV!.15\nThe hydrogen concentration in the initial films is 45\u201350\nat. %.17 Nitrogen containing samples were deposited with 10\nsccm N that results in about 6 at. % N contained within the\nfilm. Samples were implanted with Ni or W ions with doses\nin the range (0.5\u2013 12)31015 cm22 at the University of Sur-\nrey ion beam center.\nESR measurements were performed in the X-band ESR\nspectrometer employed 100 kHz field modulation ~micro-\nwave frequency n>9.4 GHz! in the temperature range from\n4.2 to 300 K. The typical sizes of samples were ;1035\n3d mm3, where d is a thickness of film. The goal of film-\non-substrate ESR measurements was to derive information5 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n5906 J.

The Raman\nspectra were detected at RT using a double monochromator,\na cooled photomultiplier employing standard photon count-\ning technique and an Ar1 laser at l5488 nm for excitation.\nFor analysis all spectra were fitted with Gaussian lines. The\ndata are presented after subtraction of the background due to\nphotoluminescence.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Raman spectra\nThe Raman spectra from PECVD a-C:H and a-C:H:N\nfilms with D ~at ;1355 cm21! and G ~at ;1581 cm21! peaks\nwere observed for the samples under study @see Figs. 1~a!\nand 1~b!#. The G peak is usually assigned to zone center\nphonons of E2g symmetry,18 while the D peak, which is the\nbreathing mode of A1g symmetry, involves phonons near the\nK zone boundary. The latter mode is forbidden in perfect\ngraphite and becomes active only in presence of disorder.19\nThe Raman spectra intensity is very low due to the strong\nphotoluminescence ~PL! background signal from the nonim-\nplanted samples. The intensities of the Raman peaks increase\nFIG. 1.

Electron spin resonance\nA summary of the room temperature ESR characteristics\nof the films studied in this work is reported in Table I. It is\nevident from Table I, that a significant concentration of para-\nmagnetic centers ~PC! is revealed for all implanted samples,\nwhile as grown and nonimplanted samples G10 and G13\n~without and with N! have only small PC concentration Ns\n<1017 cm23. Figure 2 shows the ESR spectra for the unim-\nplanted samples and for samples, which were implanted by\nW ions. It was found, that each of the weak signals in curves\n1, 3\u20135 at T5300 K could be described as a sum of two ESR\nsignals with g-factors g52.0055 and 2.0025. The contribu-\ntion of the signal with g52.0025 increases as the total inten-\nsity of ESR spectrum grows. In fact, the spectrum for\nFIG. 2.

The shape of the spectrum changes\nfrom a distorted super-Lorentzian curves ~curves 1, 3\u20135! to a\npure Lorentzian signal shape for samples with the intense\nsignal ~curve 6!. The maximum concentration of PC is\nachieved for samples W2 and W2N with the intermediate\nimplantation dose ~see inset at Fig. 2!.\nThe ESR spectra for the sample Nil ~implanted with Ni!\nare presented in Fig. 3. The ESR spectrum of this sample at\nroom temperature can be well described by a single Lorent-\nzian curve with g52.0033, or equally as well as the sum of\ntwo Lorentzian lines with a different width, with g52.0055\nand g52.0026 and weight factors ;0.25 and 0.75, respec-\ntively. The analysis of this spectrum at T560 K shows, that\nthe spectrum presents the combination of two Lorentzian\nlines with the above g factors ~see dotted line on the Fig. 3 at\nT560 K). The reason of the spectrum splitting at T560 K is\nexplained by the different saturation behavior with tempera-\nture of its components. As a result, the total spectrum at T\n<30 K is characterized by the dependence of the various line\nshapes on the applied microwave power (Pmw) ~see Fig. 3!.\nAt T54.2 K and Pmw;2 mW the spectrum component with\ng52.0055 is saturated completely and only a single Lorent-\nzian line with g52.0026 is observed ~the low-temperature g\nanomalies will be described further!. Nitrogen containing\nsample Ni1N exhibits a similar behavior. The temperature\ndependences of the ESR linewidth for the implanted samples\nare shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed from curves 1 and 2,\nthat samples W3 and W3N, with a small concentration of PC\ngive the signals where DHpp remains constant as the tem-\nperature increases.

Redistribution subject tcreases with temperature is higher for samples with a higher\nconcentration Ns . Over the entire temperature range samples\nimplanted with Ni have a higher value of linewidth than\nthose implanted with W ~curves 3, 4 and 5, 6, respectively!.\nFor a comparison, values of DHpp(T) for nonimplanted\nsamples DLHC-1 and DLHC-216 with smaller content of hy-\ndrogen ~curves 7, 8! are also presented. In the latter case,\nDHpp decreases as the temperature increases.\nIt was also observed that as the temperature was de-\ncreased, the g value became anisotropic. Figure 2 ~curve 8!\nand Fig. 3 show this phenomenon for some W and Ni im-\nplanted samples, where H0 and H90 are the orientations of\nmagnetic field along and orthogonal to the substrate plane,\nrespectively. The changes in g0 and g90 as a function of\ntemperature are shown in Fig. 5 where it is seen that the\nvalue of Dg5g (0)2g (90) decreases with temperature. Using\nthe data in Table I for PC it is possible to conclude that the\nlargest value of Dg is observed in those samples with the\nhaving the larger concentration of paramagnetic centers. The\ninset to Fig. 5 shows the values of Dg as a function versus\nNs . The dependence Dg(Ns) for nonimplanted DLC films16\nis also presented for comparison. One can see that at the\nsame spin density Dg for the implanted samples is larger.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Raman spectra behavior\nAn intensive photoluminescence is observed for the non-\nimplanted samples and implies a significant content of hy-\ndrogen ~>40 at. %!20 and rather high sp3 bond content. The\nstructure of these samples can be characterized by the pres-\nence of polymeric bonding type due to saturation of C5C\nbonds by H as [CHx groups, rather than by increasing the\nfraction of C\u2013C bonds.

All of these factors are\nrelated with reduction of sp3 content in the films. On the\nbasis of the analysis presented in Ref. 18 we estimate the sp3\ncontent to be 0.35\u20130.45 for a G-peak position near 1560\ncm21. Therefore, it may be supposed from these results, that\nthe intensity ratio I(D)\/I(G) should be increased up to 0.6\u2013\n0.7, consistent with our findings ~see Table I!. The results17\nshow that the implantation of a-C:H samples with C ions by\nthe dose ;1016 cm22 reduces the H concentration from 50 to\n;12 at. %. Therefore, one can expect that in our case the\nimplantation by heavier Ni and W ions with similar dose\nwould diminish hydrogen content at least to the same level.\nWhen the ion dose increases, the radiation disordering\nprocess begins to dominate over hydrogen desorption. This is\nconfirmed by the upshift of the D-peak position, which indi-\ncates disordering18 and by the increase of the G-peak width,\nwhich is proportional to the bond-angle disorder at sp2\nsites.19 Since the PL band position is not changed, we sug-\ngest, that the optical gap and, consequently, sp3 content are\nnot varied. Therefore, the G-peak position does not vary also\n~1558 cm21 for a-C:H:N and 1561 cm21 for a-C:H). In the\ncase of nitrogen free films at high dose of W ion implantation\nwe observed similar situation.\nThe situation for a-C:H:N films is more sophisticated.\nThe high-frequency shoulder at ;1653 cm21 appears in\nspectra of these films. This peculiarity attributed to the ole-\nFIG. 5. The temperature dependence of g (0) and g (90) for the implanted\nfilms.

Redistribution subject tfinic C5C stretching mode.23,24 Also we observed that\nI(D)\/I(G) increases and indicates that the film have still\nsufficiently content of sixfold aromatic rings. Thus, in these\nfilms the transformation of the aromatic rings to the olefinic\ngroups19 and relaxation sp3 dandling bonds to a C5C sp2\nconfiguration25 take place. It is believed, that nitrogen en-\ncourages the existing sp2 sites to clusters26 and causes the\nsp2 sites graphitization.22 We suggest, that N stimulates the\nconversion the sp3 dandling bonds to sp2 aromatic rings and\nchanges the sp2 configuration from rings to short chains\n~olefins!. The behavior of D-peak position verifies this trans-\nformation ~see Table I!. The low G-peak position can be\nexplained by the mixing of sp2 modes with lower-frequency\nsp3 modes.\nB. Electron spin resonance\nIn the as deposited samples G10 and G13 ~with and\nwithout N! there is a small concentration of paramagnetic\ndefects Ns;1017 cm23 ~Fig. 2, curves 1, 2!. Moreover, the\nESR signal from sample G13 is caused, mainly, by the de-\nfects with g52.0055 and is attributed to the dangling bonds\nfrom the Si substrate.27 This signal disappears after etching\nof substrate surface. The absence of a-C related ESR signal\nis a remarkable result in sense of the passivation of defects\ndue to hydrogen, and this fact indicates also, that the samples\nG10 and G13 are rather soft PLHC with low internal\nstresses. It was proposed in Ref. 10 for ta-C and DLHC\nfilms, the concentration of defects and width of their ESR\nlines DHpp are moderated in accordance with a decrease of\ninternal stresses. On the other hand, it was observed in Ref.\n3, that the DLHC films with concentration of hydrogen cH\n;32 at. % are rather soft PLHC films with a small level of\nthe internal stresses, and in Ref. 11 it was revealed, that spin\ndensity is only ;1.531017 cm23.\nAnalysis of the results in Figs. 2 and 3 show that the\nimplantation causes the appearance of paramagnetic centers\nin the a-C film ~defects with g52.0025),6,9\u201316,27 and in the\nSi substrate (g52.0055).28 At small and at large W implan-\ntation doses the density of spins in the film and in the sub-\nstrate are comparable ~Fig. 2. curves 3\u20135!. At the intermedi-\nate dose of W the ESR signal in film is the most intense and\nthe signal from substrate with g52.0055 is now undetectable\n~Fig. 2, curve 6!. In the case of Ni implantation the signal\nfrom substrate is stronger and contributes ;0.25 to total in-\ntensity of signal ~Fig. 3!. These effects can be readily ex-\nplained in terms of the lighter Ni ions being able to penetrate\nfurther into the Si substrate than the W ions. The presence of\nnitrogen in samples only weakly influences to the defect con-\ncentration.\nThe temperature and concentration dependencies of the\nESR line shape and linewidth are due to the basic interac-\ntions between paramagnetic centers, when their concentra-\ntion is large. Theoretical calculations of these parameters\nwere performed in Refs. 10 and 16 in DLC that takes into\naccount of both temperature dependent and temperature in-\ndependent on interactions via\nDHpp5DHpp~c ,T50 !1DHpp~c ,T !1DHpp~cH ,T !, ~1!o AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n5909J.

Equation ~2! re-\nflects the known phenomenon of the narrowing of ESR line\nwith concentration growth due to EXI between identical cen-\nters. The dependence of Eq. ~2! on PC concentration Ns pre-\nsents a curve with a minimum, which is achieved at concen-\ntration Ns;1021 cm23 for PC in DLC films.16 The\ndependence DHpp(Ns,0) for our W implanted samples ~see\ninsert to Fig. 4! also demonstrates the role of the exchange\nnarrowing but the minimum DHpp(Ns,0) occurs at a lower\nconcentration (2.231020 cm23). This is readily explained by\nthe inhomogeneous distribution of defects in the implanted\nsamples, when the local concentration of PC Ns , loc is signifi-\ncantly higher than the average measured one. The observa-\ntion of a Lorentzian line shape for samples W2 ~Fig. 2,\ncurves 6\u20138! and Ni1 ~Fig. 3 at T54.2 K) with high concen-\ntration of spins is in accordance with the conclusion about\nimportant role of the exchange narrowing of ESR signal.\nThe presence of hydrogen in the films causes an appear-\nance of the hyperfine interaction between the residual pro-\ntons and the PC and gives an additive contribution to\nDHpp .6,15,16,30 In Ref. 15 it was found the empirical relation\nbetween the peak-to-peak Gaussian contribution and the hy-\ndrogen content at room temperatures: DHpp\nG ~in Gauss!\n5~0.1860.05!3at. % H!. In Ref. 16 it was established that\nthe influence of hydrogen can be included to mechanism of\nexchange and motion narrowing and depends on the concen-\ntration of PC and on the temperature. For comparison the\ncurves 7, 8 on the Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence\nof DHpp16 for the samples with intermediate ~DLHC-1, curve\n7! and small ~DLHC-2, curve 8! content of hydrogen. These\ndependences demonstrate that DHpp decrease with tempera-\nture increase due to motion narrowing ~electron jumps be-\ntween centres with different resonance fields!. The influence\nof hydrogen to DHpp grows with growing of hydrogen con-\ncentration cH is in a qualitative accordance with conclusions\nreached in Ref. 15. In our implanted samples with high con-\ncentration of hydrogen an opposite behavior of DHpp is ob-\nserved ~Fig. 4, curves 1\u20136!, e.g., hydrogen does not cause\nthe linewidth change for samples W2 and W2N ~curves 5\nand 6!, as it would in hydrogen free samples. It is not sur-\nprising, since the implantation processes are accompanied\nhydrogen effusion.17,31 The role of hydrogen in the samples\nwith a small concentration of PC comes to the broadening ofDownloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tDHpp , along with DD interaction, and gives relatively wide\nand independent on temperature ESR line ~Fig. 4, curves\n1\u20132!. There is also an indirect mechanism of hydrogen in-\nfluence on the concentration of PC by means of intrinsic\nstress change in films. This influence and also hydrogen ef-\nfusion process during implantation make clear the irregular\ndependence of PC concentration Ns versus implantation dose\n~see insert in Fig. 2!.\nConcerning DHpp(T) for the nickel implanted samples\n~Fig. 4, curves 3, 4! we note that the RT linewidth is twice\nthe width at low temperature and a more strong dependence\nwith temperature increase to be compared with W implanted\nsamples at the same PC concentration ~Fig. 4, curves 5, 6!.\nThere is the additive contribution to DHpp due to spin\u2013spin\n(T221) and spin-lattice (T121) relaxation through the hyper-\nfine interaction of PC electron with paramagnetic nuclei of\nNi or through the spin-orbital interaction with valence elec-\ntrons of Ni, but this question is not considered in this article.\nThe values g52.0025(1) for the W implanted samples\nand g52.0026(1) for the Ni implanted samples at T\n5300 K precisely coincides with those for nonimplanted\nsamples ta-C and DLHC films.10,16 However, the low tem-\nperature resonance magnetic field ~g-value! anisotropy ~see\nFig. 5! is one of the most interesting phenomenon. It was\nobserved in ta-C films at low temperature in Ref. 10 and\nwas attributed10,16 to DD interaction in the infinitely thin\nfilms, which becomes significant at high density of the cen-\ntres and at low temperature. In this way the magnetic anisot-\nropy is due to the form factors of quasitwo-dimensional DLC\nfilms or thin large area sp2 clusters. In the present experi-\nments we have observed a similar behavior, when Dg value\nis proportional to spin density Ns and to T21 ~see Fig. 5 and\ninset!. A simple comparison with Refs. 10 and 16 demon-\nstrates, that for Ns of 231020 cm23 and T54.2 K the mag-\nnitude Dg should not exceed 231024, while experiments\nwith implanted samples we have observed Dg5(10\u2013 15)\n31024 ~see Fig. 5!. It is clear that the resonance field is\nformed by the local concentration of PC and Dg observed is\ndue to the quasitwo-dimensional character of sample frag-\nments, which do not interact each to other magnetically.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied the effects on the ESR and Raman spec-\ntra of Ni and W implantation in PECVD a-C:H and\na-C:H:N films. The ion implantation essentially reduces a\ncontent of hydrogen and initiates the radiation defects. In the\ncase of nitrogen free films the radiation disordering increases\nwith increase of ion dose. We observed the ion induced an-\nnealing for a-C:H:N films at high W ion dose due to changes\nin the sp2 \u2013 sp3 phases. The ESR measurements show that\nthe as grown films contain a low density of spins\nNs,1017 cm23. The implantation of 0.531015\u2013 1.231016\ncm22 W or Ni ions in films results in a significant concen-\ntration of paramagnetic defects Ns in the films (g\n52.0025), as well as in the Si substrate (g52.0055), which\nare attributed to carbon and silicon related defects, respec-\ntively. The value of Ns is not found to be proportional to the\nion implantation dose in a case of W ion implantation, wheno AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n5910 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 93, No. 10, 15 May 2003 Konchits et al.the maximum value Ns>231020 cm23 is achieved at the\nintermediate implantation dose f51.831015 cm22. These\nresults correlate with the data of Raman spectroscopy, point-\ning to a closed relation between the structure disordering and\nspin density in the implanted films.\nThe temperature dependence of the linewidth in the im-\nplanted samples has a character opposite to the usually ob-\nserved for DLHC samples. The main cause of this behavior\nis the sharp decreasing of the hydrogen concentration by the\nimplantation process in the samples with high dose implan-\ntation. The hydrogen may be present with essential concen-\ntration in the samples with lowest implantation doses results\nin the efficient mechanism of motion narrowing of the EPR\nline in samples with high PC concentration (Ns\n>1020 cm23) even at low temperature. The unexpected ef-\nfect of g-factor anisotropy is revealed here for amorphous\nparamagnetic materials of low temperature. It is explained by\nthe anisotropy and concentration dependence of DD interac-\ntion between paramagnetic centers in thin films.\n1 J. L.
