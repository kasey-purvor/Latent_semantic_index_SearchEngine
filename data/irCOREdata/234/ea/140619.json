The quality 7 \nof any environmental risk assessment is influenced by the input data for the distribution and 8 \ndispersion of potentially harmful substances, and by the exposure models that support an analysis of 9 \nthe probability and consequences of exposure. Landfills pose a hazard to workers and to local 10 \ncommunities because of the landfill gas (LFG) they generate. Considerable literature exists on the 11 \nhazards of bulk LFG (mainly CH4 and CO2) and, more recently, on the gas phase concentrations of 12 \ntrace hazardous components in untreated LFG (Allen et al., 1997; Scheutz and Kjeldsen, 2003; 13 \nEnvironment Agency 2003a; 2004). Risk assessment models used to evaluate the nature and 14 \nsignificance of exposure risks are now instrumental in improving landfill siting, operation, and some 15 \naspects of design (Pelt et al., 1998; Environment Agency, 2002a). The GasSim model (Environment 16 \nAgency, 2002a), for example, generates a source term for bulk gases using a first order rate equation 17 \nfor the biodegradation of the organic component of the waste, and uses default values for trace 18 \ncomponents based on concentrations in the bulk gas reported in the literature. In GasSim, the source 19 \nterm gas is partitioned between two fates: (i) combustion in an engine or flare; and (ii) passive loss 20 \nof untreated gas through the landfill cap or sidewall. The latter is the most important when 21 \nconsidering potential exposures of human or ecological receptors to harmful components. 22 \nWhilst progress has been made in modelling the distribution of potentially harmful 23 \ncomponents around a site (and hence an approximation of exposure) using standard air dispersion 24 \nmodels, risk estimates are constrained by the absence of a credible source term relative to waste 25 \n 4\ninput. In practice, concentrations of trace components are generated by the loading of chemicals in 1 \nthe initial waste mass (the source term) and the fate processes, including biotransformation, which 2 \ndeliver measurable concentrations in the gas phase. Risk analysts are keenly aware of the need for 3 \nimproved source term models that, it is hoped, will engender greater confidence in risk assessments 4 \nand risk management measures (El-Fadel et al., 1997a; 1997b; Pollard et al., 2006). In this paper, an 5 \nattempt is made to reconcile measured concentrations of four priority trace components in LFG, 6 \nwith potential source term loadings estimated retrospectively using fugacity modelling. The 7 \npotential for the fugacity approach to improve current risk assessment models for landfill, e.g. 8 \nGasSim (Environment Agency, 2002a), is introduced, reviewed and critically appraised.  9 \n 10 \nRationale 11 \nFugacity modelling (Mackay, 1979; 2001) has received a comprehensive treatment in a recent 12 \nspecial issue of a peer-reviewed journal (Gobas and Muir, 2004). Among its uses from global-scale 13 \nto in vivo modelling, its application to waste problems is increasing, albeit with an attending need to 14 \naddress the gross heterogeneity and multiphase character of wastes. Applications include its use for 15 \ndirecting site remediation decisions (Pollard et al., 1993; She et al., 1995), in quantifying vapour 16 \nemissions at contaminated sites (Mills et al., 2004) and in assessing the environmental fate of 17 \nhydrophobic compounds in landfills (Kjeldsen and Christensen, 2001).  18 \nThree models are worthy of review and establish the context of our work. The SOIL model 19 \n(Mackay, 2001) comprises four environmental compartments: air, water, soil mineral matter and 20 \nsoil organic mater. Densities, volumes, areas and depths of soil are user-specified, enabling total 21 \nvolumes and masses to be calculated, from which individual fugacities and environmental 22 \nconcentrations are derived. Other input parameters include densities and volume fractions, of air, 23 \nwater, organic and mineral matter, the mass of total soil, dry soil and organic carbon, a water-24 \nleaching rate and mean diffusion distance. With regards to chemical input data, an original mass in 25 \n 5\nthe soil needs to specified, along with physicochemical data on molecular weight, aqueous solubility 1 \nvapour pressure (Kow), and first-order reaction half-life (t\u00bd). The model accounts for losses from 2 \ndegrading reactions, leaching (DW) and volatilisation (DA) by the designation of \u2018D values\u2019 3 \n(Mackay, 2001). An adaptation of SOIL, SOILFUG (DiGuardio et al., 1994) has been designed for 4 \npesticide application to soil with subsequent surface water runoff. Adaptations include incorporating 5 \nthe effects of sequential rainfall events with input parameters that include inflow and outflow rates. 6 \nLeaching is replaced by run off (Droff) taken from the amount of water flowing out of the system, 7 \nhere a river basin. The authors attempted verification by comparing the predicted concentrations of 8 \npesticide in the outflow with environmental monitoring data (DiGuardio et al., 1994). SOILFUG 9 \nmay have relevance for a landfill environment, given the flushing of landfill cells and where 10 \nleachate recirculation events might be considered analogous to successive \u2018rainfall\u2019 events. Finally, 11 \nShe et al. (1995) describe a fugacity approach (SOILVE) to predicting the efficiency of soil vapour 12 \nextraction (VE) in removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the unsaturated zone of a 13 \ncontaminated soil; a situation physically analogous to modern landfill sites where gas is actively 14 \nextracted. SOILVE accounts for degradation, volatilisation and leaching and includes a term for gas 15 \nphase extraction. The extraction is designated a D value, DX, determined by a gas flow rate (GX m3 16 \nh-1), combined with the fugacity capacity (ZG, mol m-3Pa): 17 \nDX = GX ZG        (1) 18 \nThe model accounts for the non-uniform distribution of VOCs in soil and introduces the concept of 19 \na \u2018sweep efficiency\u2019 E; a ratio of the effective air extraction rate (GE) to the applied airflow. 20 \nE = GE\/GX        (2) 21 \nThe effective D value (DE) is then: 22 \nE DX = E GX ZG       (3) 23 \nHere, D values for DE, DA and DW are calculated as with the SOIL model, but with the substitution 24 \nof gas phase diffusion in the soil (DG), for the air in soil (DA); 25 \n 6\nDG = BEG A ZG\/Y       (4) 1 \nWhere BEG is gas phase diffusion (mol Pa-1 h), A the area m2 and Y the path length (m) 2 \nThe model recognises that the effectiveness of gas extraction declines exponentially as a result of 3 \nremoval of the gas from more permeable areas, followed by extraction from areas where the 4 \npermeability is lower. This is given by: 5 \nE = Ef = Ei e-k3t       (5) 6 \nWhere Ef is at infinite time, Ei is at time 0 and k3 is a decay constant. The presence of the decay term 7 \nmakes application of SOILVE particularly applicable to the landfill environment. 8 \n 9 \nTrace components in landfill gas 10 \nThe composition of LFG is dominated by the bulk gases methane, CH4 (40 \u2013 70 %v\/v) and 11 \ncarbon dioxide, CO2 (30 - 60%v\/v) with smaller concentrations of hydrogen, hydrogen sulphide and 12 \nother trace components (Table 1). Despite their low concentrations, hazardous trace components 13 \nmay pose a potential risk to human health where exposure is either acute, repeatedly episodic or 14 \nprolonged (Brosseau and Heitz, 1994; Allen et al., 1997; El-Fadel et al., 1997a; Zou et al., 2003). 15 \nDue to its heavy reliance on landfill, many of the more significant studies have been undertaken in 16 \nthe UK. Early work on the trace composition of LFG (Young and Parker, 1983; Allen et al., 1997; 17 \nEklund et al., 1998) identified 100-140 trace components of concern, typically constituting < 1% v\/v 18 \nof the gas (Young and Parker, 1983). Some authors believe these constituents to be ubiquitous, 19 \nregardless of whether the site operated a co-disposal (hazardous and municipal) or municipal waste-20 \nonly disposal strategy (USEPA, 1997). 21 \nA study looking at the composition of trace gases from six different landfill sites revealed 22 \napproximately 80 trace components (Meynell, 1983). Further trace components were characterised 23 \nin the late 1980s following monitoring at three UK-based landfill sites over a period of three years 24 \n(Dent et al., 1986; Department of Environment, 1988). In this case, 136 organic compounds or 25 \n 7\nisomeric groups were identified. A 1997 study of seven landfill sites in the UK observed 140 trace 1 \ncomponents, 90 of which were common to all seven sites (Allen et al., 1997). Concentrations of 2 \nvolatile organic carbon (VOCs) were closely related to methane production rates and displayed 3 \nvariation (although not significant) with ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The VOCs 4 \nidentified included vinyl chloride (chloroethene) (Young and Parker, 1983; Allen et al., 1997), 5 \ntetrachloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, chlorobenzene, 6 \ntrichloroethylene (TCE), ethylbenzene, xylene and toluene, amongst others. A similar UK-based 7 \nstudy identified 550 trace components (Environment Agency, 2003a).  8 \nThe Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA) have published a list of priority 9 \ncomponents requiring monitoring in LFG defined by their typical concentrations and published 10 \ntoxicological and odour properties (Environment Agency, 2004; Tables 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3). The 11 \nlist includes chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloroethene, 12 \n1,2-dicholoroethene and tetrachloromethane. The list was compiled acknowledging the toxicity, 13 \nknown or potential carcinogenicity and physical characteristics of these substances (Environment 14 \nAgency, 2002b; 2003a; 2003b; Table 2). The Environment Agency (Environment Agency, 2003b) 15 \nmonitored the concentrations of trace components in LFG at six sites during 2002 - 2003 for the 26 16 \nhighest priority substances (Table 2). Analysis of the data by reference to landfill type, age of gas 17 \nand environment allows a summary, for selected chlorinated components, of the concentration 18 \nranges generated by different landfill environments (Table 3). Still unknown, however, are the 19 \ninitial waste loadings that could generate these concentrations. This, and the rate at which bulk 20 \ngases are generated, affects the measured concentrations of trace components generated in the 21 \nlandfill. Addressing this knowledge gap was the starting point for this work. 22 \n 23 \nStudy aims 24 \n 8\nThis study sought to build an evaluative environment  (derived from fictitious but realistic 1 \nproperties such as volume, composition, and temperature) within which to back-calculate the 2 \npotential source terms (loads) that could generate typical concentrations of trace components 3 \nreported in LFG studies. Our study focussed on benzene, vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene (TCE) 4 \nand 1,3-butadiene as representative of the main types of priority trace component, with a view to 5 \nproviding a source term for risk assessment models such as GasSim (Attenborough et al., 2002; 6 \nEnvironment Agency, 2002a). The objectives were to (i) apply fugacity concepts to the partitioning 7 \nof trace components within the landfill environment; (ii) test and select the most applicable 8 \napproaches to an evaluative landfill environment; and (iii) compare observed concentrations of trace 9 \ncomponents with those modelled in the study. 10 \n 11 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 12 \n 13 \nEvaluative landfill environment 14 \nThe evaluative environment selected was a single cell of waste, rather than an entire landfill 15 \n(Figure 1), this choice influenced by the availability of data from the Brogborough (UK) landfill test 16 \ncells (Fletcher, 1989; Croft et al., 2001; Blackmore et al., 2003). Our evaluative environment allows 17 \nfor three phases: gas, water, and waste, and for the processes of water and gas flux through the 18 \nsystem being represented. The Brogborough test cells were constructed during 1986-88 and were set 19 \nup to evaluate the effects of pre- and post-emplacement management techniques on methane 20 \nproduction rates (Croft et al., 2001). Six cells were constructed each with a different management 21 \ntechnique such as leachate re-circulation, air injection and sewage sludge addition. A single cell 22 \ncontained a mix of domestic waste and non-hazardous commercial waste. Our study has adopted the 23 \ndesign data from cell 1, the control cell, containing domestic waste placed in thin layers (Blackmore 24 \net al., 2003). The dimensions and characteristics of cell 1 are reported in Table 4. Leachate, gas and 25 \n 9\nsolid waste were monitored at Brogborough between 1986 and 2000, making it the longest field 1 \nscale landfill study in the world (Blcakmore et al., 2003). The cells have produced limited data on 2 \nthe concentrations of trace components in the gas, but the gas production data and physical 3 \ncharacteristics of the cells (Table 5) provide a valuable base for this study. Test cell 1 was taken as 4 \nbeing typical of most UK landfill sites accepting domestic waste. The evaluative environment 5 \nremained constant for the fugacity studies that follow. 6 \n 7 \nChemical input 8 \nA recurrent issue for modelling landfills is the uncertainty associated with the composition of 9 \nincoming waste. Understanding the load and characteristics of the waste is important if generalised 10 \nfindings are to be extrapolated between sites with comparable operational histories. However, 11 \nselecting values for chemical input parameters for a model is challenging without detailed 12 \ninformation on the chemical composition of the wastes under study, which are universally absent. 13 \nDue to these difficulties, a scalable initial value of 10 mg kg-1 for all of the chemicals was initially 14 \nselected (Pollard et al., 1993). This represented a load to the cell of 160 kg. Having generated an 15 \ninitial set of gas concentrations, this enabled review and then back-extrapolation to determine 16 \npossible initial inputs of the chemical to the landfill. Molecular mass (g mol-1), temperature (\u00b0C), 17 \nwater solubility (g m-3), vapour pressure (Pa), log Kow, melting point (\u00b0C) and the Henry\u2019s Law 18 \nconstant (Pa.m3 mol-1) were required for each substance in order to parameterise Equations 1 \u2013 5. 19 \nAll parameter values were derived from those reported in Mackay (2001). 20 \n 21 \nGas and water regimes 22 \nGas flow through landfills is highly variable and dependant on a number of factors such as 23 \natmospheric pressure, design and operational parameters (Young, 1992; Croft et al., 2001; 24 \n 10\nChristopherson and Kjeldsen, 2001; Kjeldsen and Christensen, 2001). Historic data from 1 \nBrogborough test cell 1 shows gas production rates varying between 5-15 m3 t-1 waste yr-1 (Croft et 2 \nal., 2001). A mean of 10 m3 t-1 yr-1 represents a gas extraction rate of ca. 20 m3 h-1 from each cell. A 3 \nlog mean diffusion path of 4.55 m was adopted from a diffusion path of 12.5 m, judged as the 4 \nmaximum distance between gas extraction points at Brogborough and typical of a large, modern, 5 \nengineered landfill in the UK. Finally, rather than set a leachate head for this study, a water flow 6 \nrate though the cell was applied using an infiltration rate of 0.14 mm d-1 adopted from GasSim 7 \n(Environment Agency, 2002a). This flow rate assumes the input of water into the system is constant 8 \nand derived from limited infiltration through a clay cap alone (Environment Agency, 2002a). 9 \n 10 \nFugacity modelling 11 \nLevel I fugacity calculations illustrate general partitioning behaviour and preferential 12 \npartitioning to the organic fraction in the waste environment. Level II calculations account for 13 \nadvection and reactions in the form of residence time and half-lives respectively (D values). The 14 \ncalculations assume an environment in equilibrium, but under steady state flow; i.e. the amount 15 \nentering the environment is mass-balanced by the amount lost to flow, reactions or degradation. The 16 \nLevel II model (Figure 2) allows the estimation of a residence time for a substance within the 17 \nsystem. The characteristics of the system are presented in Table 6. Reaction half-lives for each 18 \nchemical in air, water and waste were required and aerobic values were adopted from Mackay 19 \n(2001). Anaerobic conditions were subsequently modelled using degradation rates obtained from 20 \naquifer studies (Aronson and Howard, 1997). Control runs set the degradation term to zero. 21 \nAn adapted level II fugacity model, SOILVE is dynamic, in that time and extraction rates can 22 \nbe specified. The model (She et al., 1995) was re-coded using Model Maker 4\u2122 (Modelkinetix, 23 \n2000). In concept, SOILVE has many similarities to the processes of LFG extraction. 24 \nParameterisation is complex and includes concentrations in various phases, as well as D values 25 \n 11\n(transport parameters). To obtain these, a level II calculation was conducted prior to the SOILVE 1 \nrun. Table 7 displays the additional parameterisation required for SOILVE and Table 8 lists the 2 \nseries of model runs undertaken to evaluate the fate of trace components in LFG (Christopherson 3 \nand Kjeldsen, 2001). The selection of runs reflects the acknowledged (Kjeldsen and Christensen, 4 \n2001) importance of (i) the free organic carbon phase (represented by foc) (ii) the gas extraction rate; 5 \nand (iii) the redox status to estimating the concentration of trace components in LFG. 6 \n 7 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION 8 \n 9 \nLevel I and II fugacity modelling 10 \nHere, discussion is reserved for the results offering greatest insight. (Shafi (2005) presents a 11 \ncomprehensive analysis). Level I modelling (Figure 3) illustrates the role of organic matter (foc) in 12 \ndetermining the partitioning of trace components in the landfill system. Organic carbon can be 13 \nrepresented by conventional soil organic (humic) matter or by the presence of a free organic phase 14 \ncommon to many hazardous waste systems (Pollard et al., 1993; Kjeldsen and Christensen, 2001). 15 \nLevel II modelling has improved utility, producing illustrative data on persistence, losses due to 16 \nadvection and reaction and other dynamic trends. Again, it highlights the influence of organic 17 \ncarbon in the waste matrix on the mass of chemical in the gaseous phase and the residence time of a 18 \nchemical, given the flux (Figure 2) in the landfill (Figure 4). The concentrations of trace 19 \ncomponents in each phase using a 10 mg kg-1 input, compared with the observed ranges in 20 \nmonitoring studies, are presented in Table 9. Observed benzene concentrations are between 3500-21 \n150 000 \u00b5g m-3.  Modelled concentrations range between 32 700-139 000 \u00b5g m-3 suggesting that, 22 \nassumptions holding, a 10 mg kg-1 (160 kg) input of benzene may be a good first approximation of 23 \nthe source term. The modelled concentrations for vinyl chloride, trichloroethylene and 1,3-butadiene 24 \n 12\nwere elevated above the observed ranges, although vinyl chloride was of the same order of 1 \nmagnitude as the observed concentrations. One approach to estimating the initial load is to back-2 \nextrapolate, taking the model assumptions as valid and the observed concentrations for each 3 \ncomponent as input (Table 10). This provides a set of candidate loads that can be re-assessed with 4 \nanaerobic degradation rates to generate a new set of phase distributions (Table 11), the air phase 5 \nconcentrations for which may be compared with the observed ranges of trace components in LFG. 6 \nOne must be cautious as to the utility of this approach. The absence of representative anaerobic 7 \ndegradation rates within landfills is a serious constraint. Further, it is clear from the analysis that the 8 \ncomplexities of the landfill environment stretch the capabilities of Level II fugacity modelling. 9 \n 10 \nDynamic fugacity modelling 11 \nLandfill processes (e.g. redox status, settlement, gas and leachate generation and chemical 12 \ncomposition) develop over decades. Exploratory SOILVE model runs were performed (data not 13 \nshown; see Shafi, 2005) (i) for ca. 1 year (8000 h) under aerobic and zero degradation conditions; 14 \n(ii) for individual components at gas extraction rates of 10, 20 and 40 m3 h-1; and (iii) for the first 15 \nyear, aerobically, at foc values of 0.05, 0.25 and 0.40. D values, along with other input parameters, 16 \nwere derived from a prior set of Level II calculations (note limitations above), using an illustrative 17 \n10 mg kg-1 input concentration (Table 8). Of specific interest is the effect of the gas extraction rate 18 \non the long-term concentrations of trace components presented in LFG. A set of SOILVE model 19 \nruns was performed for a ca. 10 yr period (90 000 h) using zero and anaerobic degradation rates at 20 \ngas extraction rates of 10, 20 and 40 m3 h-1. For the anaerobic simulations, trace component 21 \nconcentrations in the gas phase were inevitably higher than for aerobic degradation. Predicted 22 \nconcentrations of vinyl chloride appeared to be too low for all three extraction rates (Figure 5). 23 \nOnce extrapolation to 160 kg input is considered, a 10m3 h-1 extraction rate produces an order of 24 \nmagnitude concentration for vinyl chloride akin to that observed in recent field investigations 25 \n 13\n(Environment Agenvy, 2003b) between 0.3 - 4.1 years. There is no information on the age of the 1 \nfield data, however and no conclusive correlations can therefore be made. Figure 5 illustrates the 2 \nimpact that degradation and extraction rates have on the concentration of trace components in LFG. 3 \nThese factors change throughout the lifetime of a landfill (bi-, tri-phasic behaviour) generating 4 \nadditional complexity. 5 \nVinyl chloride behaviour is recognisably complex given its generation in landfill as a 6 \nbiotransformation product of chlorinated organics (Vogel and McCarty, 1985). A more appropriate 7 \nassessment of the utility of the SOILVE approach may be achieved using  less complex substrates. 8 \nThe trace components 1-3 butadiene and benzene might be expected to exhibit more straightforward 9 \ncharacteristics, being resistant to biotransformation (Figure 6). Figure 6 exhibits near linearity for 10 \nbenzene and an exponential decrease for 1-3 butadiene, becoming more pronounced at rapid 11 \nextraction rates. In both cases, the concentrations achieved are within the observed range (Table 11). 12 \nFor these less complex substrates, modelled without the complexities of biotransformation, data that 13 \nare more representative can therefore be achieved. Overall, however, the results produced with 14 \nSOILVE illustrate the importance of using appropriate biotransformation rates.  15 \n 16 \nStudy limitations and utility as a source term generator for risk assessments of landfill gas  17 \nThis study illustrates the complexities of LFG modelling under dynamic conditions even for a 18 \nwell characterised conceptual model. One of the major limitations for all three models is the 19 \nrequirement for site-specific data regarding input parameters. This is especially important in terms 20 \nof input concentrations, but also for the volumes of waste and air that are required to characterise 21 \nthe evaluative environment. Representative mean values from the literature were used here, but site-22 \nspecific information is necessary for precision in model output beyond the order of magnitude data 23 \npresented here. A significant assumption is that the organic matter is the major partition medium for 24 \norganic contaminants in waste, as it is in soil. It is widely accepted that in most waste-soil systems, 25 \n 14\nfree phase organic liquids, rather than soil humic matter, dominate the partitioning behaviour of 1 \nhydrophobic contaminants (Boyd and Sun, 1990; Young, 1992; Zemanek et al., 1997). In addition, 2 \nfor simplicity, water has been substituted for leachate in the models and leachate will in practice 3 \nexpress its own bulk density and possible co-solvency effects as it migrates through waste (Rao et 4 \nal., 1990). 5 \nA further and influential limitation is the lack of representation of a leachate hydraulic head in 6 \nthe models used. This may further account for some of the discrepancies between the observed and 7 \npredicted concentrations. The fact that a low-flow water regime has been applied in this study is a 8 \nconsequence of the clay capping that is assumed in the evaluate environment. In practice of course, 9 \ngas and leachate flow rates fluctuate resulting in temporal variation in concentrations of trace 10 \ncomponents. 11 \nAn underlying challenge with the application of fugacity to landfill modelling is the reliance 12 \non the physicochemical characteristics at standard values for 25 \u25e6C. Landfills undergo diurnal, 13 \nseasonal and microbiologically induced temperature changes through the various stages of their 14 \nlifetime, a feature that fugacity cannot address without running coupled simulations. This becomes 15 \nparticularly significant for factors such as vapour pressure and solubility, which are also effected by 16 \nthe changing pressure of the environment. Level II calculations have the limitation of requiring an 17 \nemission source to be presented as an input rate (kg h-1). In this study, this was estimated using 18 \nBrogborough waste loading rates, whereas the observed monitoring data are sourced from landfills 19 \nof very different ages and loading rates. Finally, a common source of uncertainty is the paucity of 20 \ndegradation rates for components of concern within the landfill environment and, as we have seen 21 \nhere, the referencing of waste monitoring data to input load, time of emplacement and landfill redox 22 \nstatus. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 15\nCONCLUSIONS 1 \nCan fugacity models be used to generate source term concentrations of trace components in 2 \nlandfill gas? There are clearly substantial constraints as presented by the poor referencing of 3 \nobserved trace component data noted above. Back-extrapolation of waste inputs may assist, but 4 \nthere are substantial variables in the system. In GasSim (Environment Agency, 2002a), trace 5 \ncomponent concentrations are estimated (a) using distributed literature data using a uniform or 6 \ntriangular distribution, as appropriate; or (b) from site-specific data. The evaluative environment 7 \nused in this study is similar to GasSim, the waste being considered a cuboid mass with vertical sides 8 \nfrom which characteristics such as volume and area are deduced (Environment Agency, 2002a). If a 9 \nsite-specific fugacity model were constructed and applied, informed by an estimated inventory of 10 \nsolvent mass in the landfill, then a more representative source term might be produced and 11 \nsubsequent estimates of exposure and risk made more representative. SOILVE has the potential for 12 \nproducing meaningful concentrations for the GasSim source module, the system is more dynamic 13 \nand there is an increased capacity for the propagation of error in the absence of better-characterised 14 \nsites. There is an explicit need for precise degradation data and firm evidence for the bounded 15 \nranges of key variables that influence the concentrations of trace components in landfill gas. Further 16 \nwork needs to be undertaken on the influence of successive redox regimes on trace component 17 \nbiotransformation. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe to have illustrated the potential 18 \napplication of dynamic fugacity modelling and propose that this approach may have use for the 19 \ngeneration of a better, time-dependent source term for regulatory LFG risk assessments tools such 20 \nas GasSim. 21 \n 22 \nAcknowledgement \u2013 This work was funded by the Environment Agency.
