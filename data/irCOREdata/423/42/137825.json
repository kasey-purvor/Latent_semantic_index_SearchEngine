All the experiments were \nperformed with oligonucleotides of 25 bases (probe, target and non-complementary \noligonucleotide).The four coating methods were all based on the use of self-assembled monolayers. \nThree of them employed the interaction between streptavidin and biotin for the immobilisation of a \nbiotinylated probe.Results indicated that immobilisation of a biotinylated probe on streptavidin \nlinked to a layer of carboxylated dextran provides higher sensitivity for the detection of the \nhybridisation reaction, absence of non-specific adsorption and a higher stability with respect to the \nregeneration step. \n \n \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \n \nInterest in the application of piezoelectric devices for biochemical analysis has increased \nmarkedly following the elucidation of the theory of their operation in liquids and the consequent \nappreciation that they offer an effective alternative to optical techniques such as surface plasmon \nresonance and interferometry. Methods to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of piezoelectric \nbiosensors have been pursued to facilitate their application in antigen-antibody or DNA \nhybridisation detection. The sensitivity can, in some cases, be improved by using crystals of higher \nfrequencies (> 10 MHz), but these devices are often difficult to operate in liquids because of \nfragility and frequency stability problems (Caruso et al., 1997). Alternatively, the selectivity can be \nimproved by improving the quality of the surface of the crystal and the immobilisation procedure. \nActually, the principal limitation of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is non-specific \nadsorption of molecules present in real matrices; QCM is a mass sensor and any molecule able to \nbind to the surface is a potential interferent. Experiments with piezoelectric biosensors applied to \nantigen\/antibody reactions or to DNA hybridisation clearly demonstrated that using appropriate \nimmobilisation chemistry, non-specific binding can be effectively minimised (Tombelli and \nMascini, 2000a; Zhou et al., 2001). \n \nAdvances in genomics and proteomics have catalysed escalating interest in nucleic acids as \nbioreceptors for biosensors and biochips (Vo-Dinh and Cullum, 2000). The biorecognition \nmechanism involves hybridisation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), with \nthe complementarity of adenine:thymine (A:T) and cytosine:guanine (C:G) pairing forming the \nbasis for the exquisite specificity in such biosensors. These analytical systems are often founded on \nthe immobilisation of a fragment of DNA with a specific sequence (probe) followed by monitoring \nand recording the variation of the transducer signal when the complementary fragment (target) in \nsolution hybridises with the probe. \n \nIn the present work, the optimisation of the coating of the gold quartz crystal surface in \norder to improve the immobilisation of oligonucleotide probes is reported. Four immobilisation \nprocedures are compared:  \n- aminoethanethiol\/probe; \n- 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid\/streptavidin\/biotinylated probe; \n 2 \n- mixed thiols\/streptavidin\/biotinylated probe; \n- 11 mercaptundecanol\/dextran\/streptavidin\/biotinylated probe. \n \nAll the procedures involved the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAM). Functionalised \nself-assembled monolayers offer promising possibilities for the immobilisation of biomolecules on \ndifferent solid surfaces (Allara, 1995; Gopel and Heiduschka, 1995; Mandler and Turyan, 1995; \nWink et al., 1997). Three of the four immobilisation procedures, involved the use of the biotin-\nstreptavidin interaction, which has been widely used for the immobilisation of biotinylated DNA \nprobes (Caruso et al., 1997; Okahata et al., 1998; Niikura et al. 1998, Tombelli et al., 2000b,c). In \nthis investigation of the interaction of streptavidin with biotinylated oligonucleotide probes, three \ndifferent coatings of the gold surface were used for the immobilisation of streptavidin: 11-\nmercaptoundecanoic acid, mixed thiols and thiols\/dextran.  \n \nThe four immobilisation procedures were compared and evaluated for the detection of the \ntarget oligonucleotides, the possibility of regeneration and the amount of non-specific adsorption. \nWith each procedure, after the probe immobilisation, the hybridisation reaction was evaluated with \nthe complementary oligonucleotide. Experiments were also performed with a non-complementary \noligonucleotide to verify the absence of non-specific adsorption. Regeneration of the single-\nstranded probe was obtained using HCl 1 mM for 1 minute after each cycle of hybridisation. \n \n2. Materials and apparatus \n \n2.1. Materials \n \n11-Mercaptoundecanol was synthesised in the laboratory (Miller et al., 1991). Dextran was \npurchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), epichlorohydrin and N-hydroxysuccinimide \n(NHS) from Fluka (Milan, Italy). Ethanol and all the reagents for the buffers were purchased from \nMerck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, \nItaly).  \n \nOligonucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). The \nsequences of bases of the oligonucleotides used in these experiments were as follows: \n 3 \n Probe:       5\u2019 TGGAGGACGTGTGCGGCCGCCTG 3\u2019 \n \nComplementary oligonucleotide:   5\u2019 CAGGCGGCCGCACACGTCCTCCA 3\u2019 \n \nNon-complementary oligonucleotide:  5\u2019 AAAGTCCTGGCGCAGGACAACAC 3\u2019 \n \nThe sequence of the oligonucleotide probe is included in a region of a human gene encoding \nfor the production of the protein Apolipoprotein E, where a point mutation occurs. This sequence \nwas chosen with a view to application of the optimised biosensor to the determination in real \nsamples of DNA of the polymorphism generated by this point mutation. \n \nThe composition of the buffers used for the experiments was as follows: \nImmobilisation buffer: NaCl 300 mM, Na2HPO4 20 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, pH 7.4. \nHybridisation buffer: NaCl 150 mM, Na2HPO4 20 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, pH 7.4. \n \n2.2. Apparatus \n \n10 MHz AT cut quartz crystals (14 mm, 165 \u00b5m) with gold evaporated (42.6 mm2 area, \u00d8 \n7.4 mm) on both sides were obtained by Mistral, Latina, Italy. The crystal was housed inside a \nmethacrylate cell with only one side of the crystal in contact with the solution added to the cell well.  \nBefore coating the gold surface with the different methods, the crystal was washed with 1:1:5 \nsolution of H2O2, NH3 and distilled water, respectively. \n \nThe frequency variations were continuously recorded using a quartz crystal analyser (Model \nQCA917, Seiko EG&G, Chiba, Japan): the data (the resonance frequency) are displayed on the \nmain display screen in real time and can be read directly by a computer connected to the QCA917 \ninterface. The resonant frequency can be measured with an accuracy of 0.1 Hz and at a sample \nperiod of 0.1, 1 or 10 sec. \n \n \n \n 4 \n3. Procedures \n \n3.1. Measurement set-up \n \nFigure 1 shows a typical plot of the frequency vs time during an affinity reaction between \nthe probe immobilised on the crystal and the target molecule in solution. Initially a stable baseline \nwas recorded when the crystal together with the immobilised probe was in contact with buffer. In \nthis situation the quantity of target is null both in solution and on the crystal. The buffer was then \nreplaced with an equal volume of a solution containing the target molecule prepared using the same \nbuffer. In the case of standard solutions only the target molecule have been present in the solution, \nwhereas with real samples other non-specific molecules could be contained in the matrices.  \n \nThe substitution of the buffer with the target solution caused a frequency decrease. At the \nend of the time necessary for the reaction to occur, when the frequency had reached a stable value, \nthe surface of the crystal was washed with buffer. This step is necessary to eliminate all the \nmolecules that could non-specifically adsorb on the crystal surface. At this point, the frequency \nvalue was recorded. The analytical data are represented by the frequency differences between this \nfinal value and the one recorded as baseline before the affinity reaction (\u2206F=FB-FA). \n \n3.2. Aminoethanethiol \n \nA coating procedure, based on the use of aminoethanethiol, was used for the immobilisation \nof the oligonucleotide probe. After the probe immobilisation, the hybridisation reaction was \nevaluated with the complementary oligonucleotide. Experiments were also performed with the non-\ncomplementary oligonucleotide to verify the absence of non-specific adsorption.  \n \nAfter cleaning, the quartz was soaked in a 5 mM aminoethanethiol hydrochloride\/ethanol \nsolution for 10 h at room temperature. The surface of the quartz was washed with distilled water \nand ethanol and air-dried. These treatments resulted in a self-assembled monolayer with primary \namino groups being formed on the gold surface of the quartz crystal. The crystal was then immersed \nin N-methylimidazole buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0) containing 0.1 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-\ndimethylaminopropril)carbodiimide (EDAC) and 0.05 mg\/ml of the oligonucleotide probe. The \n 5 \nelectrode was incubated for 3 h at 25\u00b0C. These conditions allow immobilisation through the 5\u2019-\nphosphate groups of the probe by the formation of a phosphoramidate bond with the amine groups \non the crystal. The modified crystal was washed three times with a solution of sodium \ndodecylsulphate (SDS) 0.25% with NaOH 0.4 M for 5 minutes to remove adsorbed \noligonucleotides. The hybridisation reaction was performed at room temperature (25\u00b0C) and using \nhybridisation buffer for the solutions of the oligonucleotides. \n \n3.3. 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid \n \nThe crystal was coated with an ethanolic 1 mM solution of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid. \nThe crystal was left in contact with the solution for 48 h and then sonicated in ethanol and rinsed \nwith pure water. After washing the crystal was seated in the cell. The surface of the crystal was then \nactivated prior to covalent coupling with 200 \u00b5l of a solution of NHS (50 mM) and EDAC (200 \nmM) in water. After 5 minutes the activating solution was replaced by a streptavidin solution at 200 \n\u00b5g\/ml in acetate buffer of 10 mM, pH 5. After 20 minutes, the residual reacting sites were blocked \nwith 200 \u00b5l of a solution of ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.6, 1 M water solution). Following \nwashing with the immobilisation buffer, the biotinylated probe was added (200 \u00b5l of a solution \ncontaining 8.5 \u00b5g\/ml of probe in immobilisation buffer). The immobilisation was allowed to \nproceed for 20 minutes. The hybridisation experiments were then performed as reported in the \nprevious sections. \n \n3.4. Mixed thiols \n \nAfter the cleaning treatment, the gold surface of the quartz crystal was coated with a \nsolution 0.5 mM of 11-mercaptoundecanic acid and 0.5 mM of 1-octanethiol. The crystal was left in \ncontact with the solution, in the dark for 24 h. The crystal was then rinsed with ethanol and water \nand sonicated in ethanol for 10 minutes. After washing with milliQ water the crystal was seated in \nthe cell. The carboxylic groups of the thiol were used to immobilise streptavidin (200 \u00b5g\/ml) and \nthen the biotinylated probe, as reported in the previous section. \n \n \n \n 6 \n3.5. Thiols and dextran \n \nThe gold on the quartz was modified with 11-mercaptoundecanol and carboxylated dextran \nto immobilise streptavidin and then the biotinylated oligonucleotide. This immobilisation procedure \nwas selected from a previous work where several procedures were compared (Storri et al., 1998a, \nb). The freshly cleaned crystal was immersed in an unstirred 1 mM ethanolic solution of 11-\nmercaptoundecanol at room temperature, in the dark, for 48 h. The crystal was then washed with \nethanol and milliQ water and sonicated for 10 minutes in ethanol to remove the excess of thiol. The \nhydroxylic surface was then treated with a 600 mM solution of epichlorohydrin in a 1:1 mixture of \n400 mM NaOH and bis-2-methoxyethyl ether (diglyme) for 4 h. After washing with water and \nethanol, the crystal was immersed for 20 h in a basic dextran solution (3 g of dextran in 10 ml of \nNaOH 100 mM). The surface was further functionalised with a carboxymethyl group using \nbromoacetic acid (1 M solution in 2 M NaOH for 16 h). All the reactions were performed at room \ntemperature. The crystal was then washed with milliQ water and placed in the cell. The surface of \nthe crystal was then activated prior to covalent coupling with 200 \u00b5l of a solution of NHS 50 mM \nand EDAC 200 mM in water. After 5 minutes the activating solution was replaced by a streptavidin \nsolution 200 \u00b5g\/ml in acetate buffer 10 mM, pH 5. After 20 minutes, the residual reacting sites were \nblocked with 200 \u00b5l of a solution of ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.6, 1 M water solution). \nAfter washing with the immobilisation buffer, the biotinylated probe was added (200 \u00b5l of a \nsolution 1.0 \u00b5M of the probe in immobilisation buffer). The immobilisation was allowed to proceed \nfor 20 minutes. At this final stage the crystal was ready for the first cycle of hybridisation: the \nhybridisation was performed using the hybridisation buffer for all the solutions. \n \n4. Results and Discussion \n \n4.1. Aminoethanethiol\/probe \n \nAn ideal monolayer is depicted as perfectly aligned, closely packed alkane chains, attached \nto a smooth surface. Alkylthiols from dilute solution form a densely packed monolayer in less than \n1 h. The adsorption time seems to be independent of the chain length, but high concentrations lead \nto shorter adsorption times. Although dense monolayers assemble quickly, well-ordered monolayers \ncan take days to form (Kim et al., 1993). An uncontaminated gold surface is important even if the \n 7 \nhigh affinity of the thiol moiety for gold displaces contaminants (Troughton et al., 1988; Keller et \nal., 1992). Most commonly, possible contaminants are removed using cleaning solutions (often \ncalled \u201cpiranha\u201d) to produce a hydrophilic gold surface. \n \nThe first procedure reported for the modification of the gold surface of a quartz crystal with \nalkylthiols and biomolecules is based on the adsorption of a functionalised alkythiol layer on the \ngold electrode, activation of this layer by a coupling reagent and subsequent covalent \nimmobilisation of the receptor molecules. The immobilisation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) on \na gold electrode with a self-assembled aminoethanethiol monolayer has been reported by Sun et al. \n(1998). In the presence of water-soluble carbodiimide reagent, the 5\u2019-terminal phosphate end of \nssDNA formed a phospharamidate bond with the primary amino group of the aminoethanethiol \nmonolayer on the electrode surface. The molecule of aminoethanethiol can be strongly adsorbed on \na gold surface through the thiol group, forming a very stable self-assembled monolayer (Chidsey et \nal., 1990).  \n \nIn the current work, this coating procedure proved suitable for the immobilisation of the \noligonucleotide probe resulting in a frequency shift of 61 Hz (\u00b1 18 Hz). The interaction of the probe \nwith the non-complementary oligonucleotide did not result in a measurable frequency shift, \ndemonstrating the absence of non-specific adsorption on the crystal surface. The hybridisation \nreaction with the complementary oligonucleotide (0.75 and 1.0 \u00b5M) produced a measurable and \nreproducible frequency shift, but it was not possible to measure lower concentrations of the \noligonucleotide (Curve 1 in Figure 2). It was possible to perform 5\/6 cycles of hybridisation-\nregeneration, using HCl 1 mM as regenerating solution, on the same side of the crystal, i.e. with the \nsame probe. The regeneration time was decreased from 1 minute to 30 seconds in an attempt to \nreduce the effects of this step on the immobilised probe and the aminoethanethiol layer. The contact \nwith the acid solution probably damaged the binding between the probe and the thiol layer.  \n \n4.2. 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid\/streptavidin\/biotinylated probe \n \nThe biotin-streptavidin interaction has some unique characteristics that make it ideal as a \ngeneral bridge system in many applications (Diamandis and Christopoulos, 1991; Savage et al., \n1992). The non-covalent interaction of streptavidin with biotin is characterised by an affinity \n 8 \nconstant of 1015 M-1. This high affinity ensures that, once formed, the complex is not disturbed by \nchange in pH, the presence of chaotropes or manipulations such as multiple washing when the \ncomplex is immobilised. \n \nFrom the results obtained from the immobilisation of streptavidin (\u2206F = 353 \u00b1 27 Hz) and \nthe biotinylated probe (\u2206F = 55 \u00b1 9 Hz), we can conclude that the immobilisation procedure \ninvolving the interaction between streptavidin and biotin is suitable for the immobilisation of an \noligonucleotide probe to a gold surface of a quartz crystal. The frequency shifts induced by the \nhybridisation reaction were detectable with all the tested concentrations in the range 0.12-1.0 \u00b5M \nwith a CVav of 20% (Curve 2 in Figure 2). The interaction of the immobilised probe with a non-\ncomplementary oligonucleotide resulted in a measurable frequency shift of 16 Hz (\u00b1 4 Hz), which \nindicates the presence of non-specific adsorption. The regeneration by a 1\u2019 treatment with HCl 1 \nmM was possible for about 7 or 8 cycles without loss of sensitivity. \n \n4.3. Mixed thiols\/streptavidin\/biotinylated probe \n \nMixed monolayers, consisting of substituted and non-substituted alkanethiols, offer the \npossibility to \u201cdilute\u201d substituted alkanethiols in order to have anchor groups available for \nimmobilisation procedures in which steric hindrance is possibly reduced (Wink et al., 1997). The \nmole ratio of a mixture of thiols in solution results in the same ratio in the mixed SAM. The two \ncomponents do not phase segregate into islands. This interesting feature can be exploited to \nimmobilise biomolecules in such a manner that steric hindrance between these molecules and their \nbinding partners is avoided. The co-adsorption process in itself will not introduce any significant \namount of effects or disorder domains within the monolayer. \n \nThis immobilisation procedure resulted in a good immobilisation of streptavidin (\u2206F = 254 \u00b1 \n33 Hz). A measurable frequency shift of 36 Hz (\u00b1 13 Hz) was obtained from the immobilisation of \nthe biotinylated probe. The hybridisation of the probe with the complementary oligonucleotide \nproduced measurable frequency shifts with all the three concentrations (0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 \u00b5M), but \nthe results were not very reproducible having a coefficient of variation (CV) of 50% in all three \ncases. The frequency shift increased increasing the concentration of the oligonucleotide (Curve 3 in \nFigure 2). The interaction of the probe with the non-complementary oligonucleotide resulted in a \n 9 \nmeasurable frequency shift of 24 Hz (\u00b1 14 Hz). This demonstrates the presence of non-specific \nadsorption of the oligonucleotide on the streptavidin layer or on the gold surface. This non-specific \nadsorption was absent in the coating procedure with aminoethanethiol or 11-mercaptoundecanoic \nacid alone indicating that this monolayers of thiols could be better ordered and cover the gold \nsurface in a more efficient way than in the case of mixed monolayers. It was only possible to \nperform 2 cycles of hybridisation-regeneration on the same side of the crystal. Probably, the \ninteraction with 1 mM HCl either damaged the immobilisation of streptavidin on the monolayer or \nthe monolayer itself. \n \n4.4. Thiols and dextran \n \nDextrans are hydrophilic and non-charged natural polymeric carbohydrates, which are \nsoluble in water in any proportion and form highly hydrated hydrogels. Due to these properties, \ndextrans show very low non-specific interactions with proteins. Owing to the high concentration of \nhydroxyl groups in the dextran molecule, chemical modification of these polymers is possible \nwithout significantly affecting their hydrophilicity. The essentially non-branched polymer chains \nare highly flexible and ligands immobilised in dextran matrices are well accessible (Piehler et al., \n1999). Hence, dextran-based polymers have found application in several fields of biochemistry and \nbiotechnology (Lofas and Johnsson, 1990; Lofas et al., 1993; Piehler et al., 1996). Another feature \nis the low non-specific binding to the matrix of components in various samples under conditions of \nhigh ionic strength, which can be attributed to a combination of the high hydrophilicity of the \nsurface and entropic effects due to the flexible polymer chains.  \n \nThe immobilisation of streptavidin on carboxylated dextran resulted in a measurable \nfrequency shift of 300 Hz with a CV of 20%. This is an acceptable reproducibility considering the \nseveral steps that are necessary for the coating of the gold surface. The binding of the biotinylated \nprobe to the layer of streptavidin gave an average frequency shift of 103 Hz (\u00b1 37 Hz) which was \nhigher in comparison to the previous immobilisation methods. Curve 4 in Figure 2 shows the \naverage frequency shifts relative to the hybridisation of the immobilised probe increasing the \nconcentration (0.1-1.0 \u00b5M) of complementary oligonucleotide. These measurements were \nperformed on different crystals or on the same crystal using the regeneration procedure with HCl 1 \nmM. Non-specific binding was also investigated: measurements with the non-complementary \n 10 \noligonucleotide were performed with solutions 0.50 and 1.0 \u00b5M. It is notable that the measurements \nobtained with the non-complementary strand did not result in a measurable frequency shift. \nRegeneration with 1 mM HCl worked well and the frequency response in buffer after the \nregeneration step only started to increase after 15-20 hybridisation-regeneration cycles, probably \nbecause part of the coating was removed together with the bound analyte. Furthermore, the coated \ncrystals could be kept at 4\u00b0 for several weeks without losing their activity. \n \n4.5. Comparison between the tested procedures \n \nThe evaluation of the immobilisation procedure from the four schemes tested, was achieved \nby considering the amount of streptavidin and biotinylated probe immobilised, the frequency shifts \nresulting from the hybridisation reaction and the extent of non-specific adsorption represented by \nthe frequency shift resulting from the interaction between the probe and a non-complementary \noligonucleotide. \n \nIn Figure 3 the results of the immobilisation of streptavidin and of the biotinylated probe are \ngiven for each of the four modification procedures. In the three that required the immobilisation of \nstreptavidin, the frequency shifts resulting from this step were similar, and all demonstrated the \nsuitability of the coating procedure for the immobilisation of the protein. The coefficient of \nvariation (CV) of the method based on thiols and dextran was higher (~20%) compared to the other \nmethods and this is probably due to the larger number of steps required for this coating scheme. The \nmodification procedure based on thiols and dextran was more efficient, with the frequency shift \nresulting from immobilisation of the biotinylated probe being almost twice that for the other \nimmobilisation schemes. Reproducibility was very similar for all the methods (~30%). \n \nThe hybridisation reactions between the immobilised probe and the complementary \noligonucleotide for each of the immobilisation procedures are reported in Figure 2. Clearly, higher \nsensitivity was achieved by the use of thiols and dextran: the first two methods, the one without \nstreptavidin and the one with mixed thiols and streptavidin, showed a very low sensitivity. The \nfrequency shifts relative to the hybridisation with the probe immobilised with mercaptoundecanoic \nacid and streptavidin reached a plateau after 0.25 \u00b5M, whereas with thiols\/dextran\/streptavidin a \nlinear increase with concentration increasing in the range 0.1-1.0 \u00b5M was obtained. The average \n 11 \nCV was much lower in the case of this last immobilisation procedure (16%) with respect to all the \nother three (>20%). \n \nFrom Figure 4 we can make some comment on non-specific adsorption. The interaction of \nthe immobilised probe with the non-complementary oligonucleotide resulted in a measurable \nfrequency shift in the methods based on thiols or mixed thiols and streptavidin. In the other two \ncases no significant frequency decrease was recorded after this interaction. The number of \nhybridisation\/regeneration cycles was much higher in the case of the immobilisation procedure \nbased on thiols\/dextran\/streptavidin (Figure 5). \n \nConsidering the sensitivity, the amount of protein and probe immobilisation, the absence of \nnon-specific adsorption and the possibility of regeneration, the immobilisation procedure based on \nthiols\/dextran\/streptavidin is recommended for the modification of the crystals for this application. \nThis modification scheme requires about three days for the coating of the crystal with carboxylated \ndextran, but once modified, the crystal can be stored at +4\u00b0C for about one month. The \nimmobilisation of streptavidin and of the probe is completed in about 1 h. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nFour different modification procedures were tested for the realisation of a piezoelectric \nDNA biosensor. The biosensor can be applied to the determination of the hybridisation reaction. \nThe immobilisation methods were used for the modification of the gold surface of piezoelectric \ncrystal with oligonucleotide probes. The procedures were compared with respect to the \nmeasurement of hybridisation, the possibility of regeneration and non-specific adsorption. All the \nmethods tested required the use of thiols. Three of them are based on the use of streptavidin-biotin \ninteraction. The best results were obtained with dextran and streptavidin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \nReferences \n \nAllara, D.L., 1995.
