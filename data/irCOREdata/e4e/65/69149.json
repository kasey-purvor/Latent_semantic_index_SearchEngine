Signatory countries to\nthe Stockholm Convention are required to produce a national\nimplementation plan (NIP), to identify and reduce sources, and\nto monitor for effectiveness in reducing ambient levels and\nhuman\/wildlife exposure.1 Under the United Nations Environ-\nment Programme (UNEP) a global series of regional reports\nwas produced, which\u2014where possible\u2014summarised measured\nambient data in order to evaluate regional hotspots etc. The\nreports for some regions were relatively \u2018data rich\u2019 (e.g. Europe,\nNorth America and Asia).2\u20134 In contrast, there is still a lack of\ninformation for the Middle East.5\nIn 2003, UNEP produced a report on the objectives and\npossible design of a Global Monitoring Network for POPs.6\nMindful of the costs of sampling and analysis, the report\nconsidered the environmental and biological matrices which\ncould be used to perform rapid reconnaissance and assessment of\nPOP levels and distributions. Often there may be interest in an\ninitial, relatively cheap and easy evaluation of a country or region,\nwhich has little or no published data or \u2018in house\u2019 expertise for\nenvironmental sampling and analysis.6 Air sampling, often using\ninnovative passive sampling techniques, can give usefulCentre for Chemicals Management and Environmental Science\nDepartment, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster, UK LA1 4YQ\n\u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Maps of Iran,\nshowing key features of the country, includes the distribution of\npollutants and sites selected for sampling. Tables provide sampling\ndata. See DOI: 10.1039\/b802061b\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008information to compare with other regions where data are more\nplentiful.6,7 However, even passive air sampling requires local\noperatives for the samplers and return visits to the sites.\nIran is a country for which very little information on POPs\nexists. In 2007, the opportunity to visit and conduct a spatial\nsurvey of Iran arose. Less than 6 months and less than $10 000\nwas available to conduct a study as part of a Masters degree. This\nfigure had to include the flights from the UK to Iran, internal\ntravel in Iran, sampling and analytical costs. Consideration was\ntherefore given to how data could be obtained cheaply, quickly\nand easily from a single visit to the country. Deployment of\npassive air samplers was not an option, because they would\nrequire a return visit. Butter was selected as the sampling medium\ninstead. Several studies have used butter to assess environmental\ncontamination with POPs.8\u201312 It is a convenient and relatively\nuniform monitoring medium and reflects the regional and global\nscale distribution of POPs.8,9 The high lipid content of butter\n(typically \u000180% fat) provides relatively high concentrations of\nmost POPs, with good detection limits and relatively easy\nanalysis.12 Residues in butter reflect the occurrence of POPs in\nthe cow\u2019s feed (typically pasture grass), which in turn is\ncontaminated via atmospheric deposition of diffusive airborne\nPOPs. Supporting studies show the quantitative link between air\nconcentrations, herbage concentrations, and milk fat concen-\ntrations.13,14 PCBs and other semivolatile persistent, bio-\naccumulatory organic contaminants reach human tissue\nprimarily via dietary intake of meat and dairy products (i.e.,\nmilk, butter, and cheese) and fish. Cows are therefore one of the\nmain suppliers of these chemicals to humans.13,14\nThis paper describes a simple survey, but illustrates how useful\ninformation about chemical usage and distribution can be\nobtained on a national scale from such an exercise.J. Environ. Monit., 2008, 10, 861\u2013866 | 861\nFig. 1 presents a map of Iran and its geographical region,\nshowing the major cities and the sample locations. Iran has\na population of 70 million people and a land area of 1 650 000\nkm2. Its mixed topography ranges from mountainous areas in the\nwest, northwest, and north to flat areas in the east, centre and\nsoutheast. Iran\u2019s climate is mostly arid or semiarid, with more\nhumid areas in the coastal plains of the Caspian Sea, the Persian\nGulf and the Gulf of Oman. Economically, the country\u2019s major\nmanufactured products are petrochemicals, steel and copper\nproducts. Agriculturally, about 20% of the land in Iran is arable.\nThe main food-producing areas are in the north (Caspian region)\nand northwest. Supplementary Figures SI-1\u20133\u2020 give details of\nthese features of the country.Experimental\nSample collection\nIn total, 50 \u2018home made\u2019 (local) and 3 commercial butter samples\nwere collected during April and early May 2007 from 12 of the 30\nprovinces of Iran (see Fig. 1 and Figure SI-4\u2020 for more details).\nThe provinces sampled (in the north, northwest and centre) are\nthe areas where most of the population of the country lives and\nwhere most of the industry is based. \u2018Home made\u2019 samples derive\nfrom: (1) farmers in some rural areas who raise a few cows to\nsupply their own dairy products and then sell their extra products\nto local people at their houses; (2) farmers in some parts of the\ncountry, especially the north, who make various foodstuffs in\ntheir homes, and then sell their excess dairy products\u2014includingFig. 1 Location map of Iran and the sample sites (shown as red dots).

Table SI-1\u2020 provides details of the\nsample locations.\nSamples (\u0001200 g each) were obtained, placed in hexane-rinsed\naluminium foil, transferred to labelled PE zip-lock bags and\nsealed quickly to avoid contamination. They were placed in\na cool box for the day and frozen. Three commercial butter\nsamples were also purchased from supermarkets. The samples\nwere stored and transported frozen to Lancaster University until\nanalysis. During the butter collection, farmers\/sellers were\ninterviewed regarding the type and origin of the cows\u2019 food and\nfeed supplements in order to ensure that samples were obtained\nfor which the cows were fed with local products only.Extraction and clean-up\nAbout 1.5 g of butter was weighed into a pre-weighed (clean and\npreviously solvent rinsed) 250 ml flask. Sub-samples were taken\nfrom the centre of the butter portions, to minimize the influence\nof any possible surface contamination from the packing. Then\n\u00015 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added. Approximately\n50 ml of hexane was added and the solution heated on a steam\nbath until the butter dissolved in the hexane, it was then cooled.\nIn order to determine the lipid content, approximately 20% of the\nextract (exact weights of sub-samples recorded) were transferred\nto a pre-weighed vial, evaporated until dryness and re-weighed.\nOn average the samples contained 78% lipids with a relative\nstandard deviation of 10%. The remaining sample in the flaskidentification numbers of the sample sites are shown in Figure SI-4\u2020 in\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008\nwas spiked with 25 ml recovery standards containing 13C12-\nlabelled PCBs (PCB-28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180, 209) and\nevaporated in a rotary evaporator to \u00015 ml.\nThe extract was first cleaned on a 25 mm i.d. column, packed\nwith 9 g of acidified silica gel (9 : 2 (w\/w) activated silica :\nconcentrated sulfuric acid) between two thin layers of anhydrous\nsodium sulfate. The sample was applied quantitatively to the\ncolumn and eluted with \u0001200 ml hexane. It was then evaporated\nto ca. 3 ml on the rotary evaporator and blown down to \u00010.5 ml\nunder a gentle nitrogen stream. A final clean-up was performed\non a Biobeads S-X3 gel permeation chromatography (GPC)\ncolumn using a hexane\u2013dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1) as the\nmobile phase. The first 16 ml of the eluate was discarded as it\ncontained lipids; the following fraction of 25 ml, containing the\ntarget compounds, was collected and reduced to about 0.5 ml in\na 40 ml vial under a gentle nitrogen stream. The sample was\ntransferred to a small tulip GC vial, with several washings and\n25 ml of dodecane, containing PCB-30 and 13C12 PCB-141 as\ninternal standards added as keeper solvent to reduce analyte\nlosses upon evaporation. The final solution was then reduced to\n25 ml and analyzed by GC-MS.\nGas chromatography\nThe samples were analysed for a total of 44 PCBs (congeners 18,\n22, 28 + 31, 41 + 64, 44, 49, 52, 54, 70, 74, 87, 90 + 101, 95, 99,\n104, 105, 110, 114, 118, 123, 132 + 153, 138, 141, 149, 151, 155,\n156, 157, 158, 167, 170, 174, 180, 183, 187, 188, 189, 194, 199,\n203) and OC pesticides (hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a- and\ng-chlordane, p,p0-DDD, -DDE, -DDT, o,p0-DDD, -DDE,\n-DDT) by GC-MS on a Finnigan Trace operated in positive\nelectron ionisation mode using selected ion monitoring.

Farmers in the north may use rice stems and rice\nbran as supplements. Root crops and cereal grains typically\ncontain very low concentrations of POPs. The general pathway,\ncontaminating butter with these compounds, is therefore\nbelieved to be: air \u2013 deposition to above-ground plant parts \u2013\ningestion by the cow \u2013 absorption \u2013 and transfer to milk fat.8,13,14\nThis may be supplemented by POPs bound to ingested soil, and\nby low levels of these pollutants in the cereal grain and root crop\nfeed supplements \u2013 a pathway that may play a significant role for\npesticides in areas where they are used in agriculture. The full\norganochlorine pesticide and PCB data sets are given in Tables\nSI-2 and SI-3\u2020, respectively.\nP\nDDTs\nThe most frequent DDT isomers and metabolites detected were\np,p0-DDE (100%), p,p0-DDT (96%), and p,p0-DDD (94%).\nConcentrations of\nP\nDDT (p,p0-DDT, o,p0-DDT, p,p0-DDE, and\np,p0-DDD) varied between 660 and 607 000 pg g\u00021 over the study\narea with lowest levels detected in the northwest and highest\nlevels in central Iran (see Fig. 2a). On average, concentrations in\nIranian butter samples were considerably higher than those\nfound in a global study.8 This result agrees with the relatively\nhigh levels determined in human milk samples collected in Tebriz\n(northwest Iran) in 1991, compared to other countries.15,16 In the\npresent study, some of the samples with high DDT levels were\nfrom urban areas. This may be linked to indoor spraying, used in\nthe past to control vector-caused diseases such as malaria. The\ncentral region is primarily agricultural, with wheat, barley and\ncotton as the typical crops. Here, the high burdens clearly indi-\ncate extensive usage of DDT mixtures as pesticides, but they were\ndominated by p,p0-DDE, suggesting older residues\/past usage.\nThe p,p0-DDT to p,p0-DDE ratio provides an indication of how\nrecently DDT formulations have been released to the environ-\nment, with the ratio decreasing over time as the DDT degrades.\nTo allow for a sensible interpretation of DDT\/DDE ratios it is\nnecessary to take into account that typical values vary consid-\nerably between different environmental media.17 Ratios in soil or\nsediment, and therefore also in the air and in vegetation, are\nusually significantly higher than those in animal productsJ.

Environ. Monit., 2008, 10, 861\u2013866the current data set are 0.62 and 0.02 in the northwest and north,\nrespectively, a large variation (see Fig. 2b). In some samples,\nmainly from the northwest of the study area where the risk of\nmalaria is very low, high DDT\/DDE ratios of up to 0.62 suggest\nfresh application of DDT. The average DDT\/DDE ratio for all\nIranian samples was 0.15, slightly higher than the mean ratio\n(0.09) obtained in a global butter survey conducted around 20008\n(see Table 1).Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers\nHCHs have been commercially available as either technical\nHCH, typically consisting of 60\u201370% a-HCH, 5\u201312% b-HCH,\n10\u201312% g-HCH, 6\u201310% d-HCH and 3\u20134% 3-HCH,20 or as\nlindane (pure g-HCH). The vast majority of HCH used today is\nin the form of the g isomer. b-HCH is the most metabolically\nstable and predominant isomer accumulating in human tissues.\nFig. SI-5\u2020 shows the spatial distribution of HCHs detected in the\nIranian butter samples. The variation between highest and lowest\nconcentrations of individual isomers in butter samples (above\nMDL) was 124 times for a-HCH, 112 for b-HCH, and 86 for g-\nHCH. The highest concentrations of each isomer were found in\nthe centre of the country. High a\/g-HCH ratios are often used as\nevidence of current technical HCH application. The mean value\nof this ratio for butter samples from Iran was \u00011; lower than in\nIndia, China, and Philippines.8 Higher ratios of \u00015 and 3,\nrespectively, were recorded in central parts of Iran. However, as\nthey coincide with high levels of b-HCH, this suggests rather past\nthan current usage of technical mixtures at these sites (in some\nsamples b-HCH is the most abundant isomer despite its relatively\nlow percentage in technical HCH).20 Only in a few samples from\nthe north did relatively high HCH concentrations, dominated by\nthe g-isomer, indicate a more recent use of products containing\nlindane.Hexachlorobenzene (HCB)\nAlthough HCB does not appear to have been used as a pesticide\nin Iran, it was widely detected, ranging between 450 and 4900 pg\ng\u00021 (see Fig. SI-6\u2020). The range of values (factor of \u000111) was lower\nthan for other organochlorine compounds studied in this survey\nand the mean Iranian concentration was slightly higher than thesamples from Iran and the results of Kalantzi et al.8 in 23 countries across\nalantzi et., 2001a\ninimum\ng g\u00021\nMaximum\npg g\u00021\nMeanb (RSDc)\npg g\u00021\nMediand\npg g\u00021 Highest country\n30 14 100 2860 (94%) 2140 Czech Republic\nMDL 25 200 1180 (290%) 438 India\n80 177 000 21 600 (190%) 5800 Mexico\n.005 0.43 0.09 (88%) 0.07 Netherlands\nMDL 98 000 2750 (480%) 389 India\nMDL 108 000 2750 (530%) 282 India\nMDL 17 600 1920 (180%) 827 Spain\nMDL 6240 1480 (91%) 936 Czech Republic\nentration above MDL. c Relative standard deviation. d Including samples\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008\naverage found in a global study8 (Table 1). The relative unifor-\nmity of HCB in the butter samples is consistent with ambient\nglobal levels being largely controlled by secondary sources and\nenvironmental recycling.21 This has been observed previously for\nair samples from Europe.22Chlordanes\nChlordanes were below MDL (corresponding to ca. 50 pg g\u00021\nlipid) in all of the butter samples from Iran.PCBs\nP\nPCB concentrations varied between 350 and 57 400 pg g\u00021\n(a factor of \u0001160) (Fig. 3; Table 1) with the highest concentra-\ntions found in samples from Mazandaran province in the north\nand from large cities such as Tehran, Isfahan and Arak. These\nare among the most industrialised and densely populated parts of\nthe country. Lowest values were found in Chongharaloy (Urmia)\nand Dasht e Abi (Ghazvin)\u2014rural\/remote areas. Broadly, PCB\nconcentrations declined on an urban\u2013rural gradient. However,\nthe gradient was sharper for high molecular weight PCBs than\nfor lower chlorinated congeners: the high-to-low ratios between\nsamples from Isfahan, Arak and Tehran as urban sites and\ncorresponding rural sites are 2.5, 1.7 and 4.0 for PCB-28 + 31 and\n4.4, 4.3, 4.3 for PCB-180, respectively. Therefore the ratio\nbetween PCB congeners 180 and 28 + 31 is usually higher in the\nvicinity of sources than in areas further away (see supporting\ninformation, Table SI-3\u2020). This is consistent with urban\u2013rural\ngradients that have been reported previously for PCBs in air.23,24\nGiven the higher particle deposition rates in urban areas\ncompared to rural ones, this phenomenon can be attributed to\nthe generally decreasing vapour pressure of PCBs with increasing\nmolecular weight,24 resulting in increasing particle\u2013air partition\ncoefficients and decreasing potential to revolatilise once the\nchemical has been trapped, e.g. in plant surface waxes. The\nunusually high ratio between high and low chlorinated PCBs in\nGhaemshahr (north, sample 24) may be caused by cows ingesting\nfeed or soil\/sediments that were contaminated directly by PCB\ncontaining products rather than airborne pollutants.Fig. 3 PCBs in the Iranian butter samples.\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008Conclusions\nRegarding organochlorine pesticides in Iran, high levels of DDT\nand its metabolites in rural areas indicate mainly agricultural use\nof this substance, while HCHs have probably been used for both\nagricultural and non-agricultural purposes, as no clear urban\u2013\nrural difference could be observed. In central Iran, the region\nwith the highest DDT concentrations, relatively low DDT\/DDE\nratios indicate extensive use of this pesticide in the past, still\nsupplying the region with high levels, probably predominantly by\nvolatilisation from contaminated soils. Comparing levels of\na- and g-HCH in Iranian butter samples with a global average,8\npast and present application of technical HCH mixtures in Iran\nseems to be rather low, compared to other parts of the world.\nHCB showed a homogenous distribution with relatively low\nconcentrations throughout the study area. It is therefore believed\nto originate mainly from other countries\/regions, reaching Iran\nby atmospheric transport, a process that is very effective in\ndistributing HCB widely, due to the compound\u2019s relatively high\nvapour pressure and high persistence.21\nEven though Iran is not known for widespread PCB applica-\ntion in the past, total PCB concentrations in butter exceeded\na \u2018global average\u2019 previously reported in a butter survey (Table\n1).8 Highest burdens were found in the most populated and\nindustrialised areas of the country.\nP\nPCB concentrations\ndecreased from urban to rural areas, a trend that was more\npronounced for higher chlorinated congeners than lower\nchlorinated ones which are more mobile in the atmosphere.\nThe results of this survey show how butter can act as a bio-\nmonitoring tool, to quickly assess the spatial distribution of\nPOPs across a country\/region. To our knowledge, this is the first\ncountrywide survey of POPs in the Middle East, a region with\nvery little information on the distribution\/concentration of\nPOPs.Acknowledgements\nFunding for POPs research from the UK Natural Environment\nResearch Council, and from the UK Department of the Envi-\nronment, Food and Rural Affairs is gratefully acknowledged.\nWe are grateful to David Hughes and Sue Hodson for continued\ntechnical support.References\n1 UNEP, Final Act of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on The\nStockholm Convention On Persistent Organic Pollutants, United\nNations Environment Program, Geneva, Switzerland, 2001.\n2 UNEP\/GEF, Regionally Based Assessment of Persistent Toxic\nSubstances, Europe (Region III) Regional Report, 2002.\n3 UNEP\/GEF, Regionally Based Assessment of Persistent Toxic\nSubstances, North America (Region II) Regional Report, 2002.\n4 UNEP\/GEF, Regionally Based Assessment of Persistent Toxic\nSubstances, South East Asia and South Pacific (Region VIII)\nRegional Report, 2002.\n5 UNEP\/GEF, Regionally Based Assessment of Persistent Toxic\nSubstances, Indian Ocean (Region VI) Regional Report, 2002.\n6 K.
