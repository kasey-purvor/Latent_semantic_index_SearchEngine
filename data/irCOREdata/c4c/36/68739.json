(2007) reported on an interesting 15N\nlabeling study. Under field conditions, they assessed\nwhether coexisting plant species of temperate grasslands\nshow preferences for different chemical forms of\nnitrogen (N), including ammonium nitrate (inorganic\nN) and three amino acids of varying complexity\n(organic N). The authors found that all plant species\nwere able to take up the full range of amino acids\noffered to them, as shown by 15N and 13C enrichment in\nplant tissues. However, plants all preferred inorganic\nover organic N, indicated by higher 15N enrichments\nafter ammonium nitrate compared to organic N\nlabeling. We do not object to the general interpretation\nof the results and the authors\u2019 main conclusions. Yet,\nwe would like to comment on the plant uptake of intact\namino acids. When testing for significant relationships\nbetween excess 13C and 15N of plants to infer direct\nuptake of amino acids (Na\u00a8sholm et al. 1998), Harrison\net al. (2007) should have accounted for the different\nC:N ratios of the amino acids used. The amino acid\ntracers were U-13C2-\n15N-glycine, U-13C3-\n15N-serine, and\nU-13C9-\n15N-phenylalanine (all 15N 98% and 13C 98%),\nand their ratios of C:N atoms are 2:1, 3:1, and 9:1\nrespectively. While the authors point out that these\ndifferences in available C may affect the preferences of\nplants and microbes, they omitted to consider the\nmethodological consequences. One common problem\n(see e.g., Jones et al. 2005) when using dual-labeled\namino acids to study organic N uptake by plants is\ndetecting the 13C label in plants. Due to the high C:N\nratio of plants and the high abundance of 13C (;1.08\natom % in C3 plants), the dilution of C is usually 60\u2013150\ntimes higher than that of 15N (Na\u00a8sholm and Persson\n2001). Finding a significant relationship between excess\n13C and 15N requires separating the shift in 13C resulting\nfrom direct amino acid uptake from natural variation\nand analytical error. However, this is often not possible,\ndue to rather low concentrations of tracer 13C. As a\nsolution, Na\u00a8sholm and Persson (2001) suggested to\nconcentrate the labeled fraction of the plant material\nstudied, by extracting the soluble fraction containing\nthe label. For assessing the uptake of intact amino acids\nusing the dual-labeling approach, the critical step is to\nassure that there is a theoretical possibility of detecting\nthis uptake. From the measured values of d15N (after\nlabeling with 15N) the theoretical shift in d13C\ncorresponding to 100% intact uptake can be calculated\n(Na\u00a8sholm and Persson 2001). Thereby it can be\ndetermined whether this shift is distinguishable from\n\u2018\u2018noise.\u2019\u2019\nGiven the high amount of C in phenylalanine, it is not\nsurprising that Harrison et al. (2007) found a significant\nrelationship between excess 13C and 15N across all\nspecies for this amino acid, but not for glycine and\nserine. In their paper, Fig. 2A shows that shoot 15N\nenrichment over all plant species was highest for glycine\nand lowest for phenylalanine (among organic N forms),\nwhile shoot 13C enrichment was similar for all amino\nacids (Fig. 2C). This almost opposite pattern for 13C and\n15N enrichment also applies for single species (Fig. 1),\nroots (Fig. 3), and microbes (Fig. 4). In the latter, 13C\nenrichment was actually highest when labeled with\nphenylalanine, and lowest in the case of glycine. We\nthink that these results are due to the different C:N\nratios of the three amino acids rather than indicating\nhigher uptake of phenylalanine compared to glycine and\nserine, which is particularly unlikely given that phenyl-\nalanine is the largest and most complex amino acid\ntested. However, without significant relationships be-\ntween excess 13C and 15N in plant tissues, the proportion\nof amino acids taken up as intact molecule cannot be\nestimated for glycine and serine. Moreover, although no\ndata on amino acid concentration in the soil solution are\nshown, it is likely that phenylalanine is the least\nabundant of the three amino acids, and glycine the\nmost abundant. Thus, the dilution of the added 15N\ntracer (equal for all N forms) by the natural abundance\npool was probably least for phenylalanine and strongest\nfor glycine, again leading to an overestimation of\nphenylalanine uptake when assessed by 15N labeling.\nWe fully agree with Harrison et al. (2007), that a\nrigorous test to detect organic N uptake by plants\nrequires compound specific isotope analysis (a combi-\nnation of gas chromatography with isotope ratio mass\nspectrometry; see e.g., Persson and Na\u00a8sholm 2001).

Harrison,1,3 Roland Bol,2 and\nRichard D. Bardgett1\nThe comment of von Felten et al. (2008) raises a\nnumber of interesting and valid points concerning the\nmeasurement of direct uptake of amino acids by plants.\nBut, as they highlight, none invalidate our main finding\nthat all plant species tested were able to take up the full\nrange of amino acids presented to them, but that all\npreferred inorganic over organic N forms (Harrison et\nal. 2007). Hence, our findings do not support the idea\nthat species-specific partitioning on the basis of chemical\nform provides a mechanism for plants to efficiently\npartition a limited soil N pool in temperate grassland.\nThe first issue raised by von Felten et al. concerns the\nneed to take into account different C:N ratios of amino\nacids when testing for significant relationships between\nexcess 13C and 15N in plant shoots, which is often used\nto infer direct uptake of amino acids (e.g., Na\u00a8sholm et\nal. 1998, Streeter et al. 2000, Nordin et al 2001, Bardgett\net al. 2003, Weigelt et al. 2005). This is an important\npoint that we did take into account in our study, but\nwhich requires further clarification. For each N form, a\nline was plotted to signify 100% intact uptake of that\namino acid. This line took into account the ratio of C:N\nwithin each amino acid, be it 1:2 (glycine), 1:3 (serine),\nor 1:9 (phenylalanine). The equation of each line was\nthen used to calculate the percentage of direct uptake\nbased on the data we recorded, i.e., how far removed the\nactual line was from a theoretical maximum of 100%.\nWe found few significant relationships between excess\n13C and 15N in shoot material, and those that were\nsignificant only corresponded to between 7\u201324% direct\nuptake. Therefore, we made only cautious conclusions\nabout direct uptake in our study, highlighting that it is\nlikely that a certain proportion of the labeled N forms\nwere mineralized by microbes to other N forms prior to\nplant uptake. Moreover, we fully accept that the use of\nsuch relationships to infer direct uptake is problematic\nin that 13C:15N ratios may also be affected by plant\nendogenous processes, especially when measured in\nshoot material. As highlighted in our discussion and\nby von Felten et al., absolute confirmation of direct\nuptake requires gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\n(GC-MS) or gas chromatography\u2013combustion\u2013isotope\nratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) analysis of plant\ntissue to detect the specific isotopic label of the\nindividual amino acids inside the plant (Bol et al. 2002).\nThe second point raised by von Felten et al. concerns\nthe apparent opposite patterns of uptake of 15N and 13C\nin plant shoots, roots and microbes (Harrison et al.\n2007: Figs. 1\u20134). Looking at the data however, we feel\nthis is not the case for all fractions. For example, in Fig.\n1, while there is greater uptake of 15N from glycine than\nphenylalanine for all species tested, there is not a\nconverse pattern of uptake of 13C for each species; for\nthree out of the five species tested there would appear to\nbe no significant difference in uptake of 13C from each of\nthe three N forms presented. Similarly, looking at Fig.\n2c, we found no significant difference in uptake of 13C\nacross all of the N forms tested; we also found the same\nto be true for uptake of 13C into plant roots (data not\npresented). As highlighted by von Felten et al., microbial\nenrichment by 13C (Fig. 4) did indicate greater uptake of\nphenylalanine compared to glycine and serine. However,\nthe potential overestimation of phenylalanine uptake\ninto the microbial fraction was noted in our discussion:\nalthough we found significantly greater 13C from\nManuscript received 25 September 2007; accepted 13\nNovember 2007.

(Glycine\nand phenylalanine have the same number of N atoms\nper molecule, but the number of C atoms differs\ndramatically, with glycine having two and phenylalanine\nhaving nine. Therefore, a greater amount of 13C from\nphenylalanine than glycine will be detected per unit\nuptake of N by microbes.)\nThe final point raised by von Felten et al. concerns the\npotential for differential dilution of 15N tracer due to\nvariable concentrations of individual amino acids in soil\nsolution. We fully agree with this comment and for this\nreason we were cautious in drawing conclusions on\ndifferential uptake of amino acids, especially since we\ndid not measure concentrations of individual amino\nacids in soil solution; it is notoriously difficult to obtain\nrealistic measures of soil solution amino acid concen-\ntrations because the turnover of amino acids is so rapid\n(Boddy et al. 2007). We were careful to highlight this\nissue in our discussion, i.e., that soil concentrations of\nphenylalanine and serine are likely low relative to other\namino acids tested, especially glycine, and hence the\nuptake of phenylalanine and serine might have been\noverestimated relative to its importance. While we did\nnot take this dilution effect into account in our study, we\nbelieve that it doesn\u2019t invalidate our main finding that\nplants preferred glycine over phenylalanine because\nshoot 15N concentration was significantly lower for\nphenylalanine than for all other N forms tested. If\nanything, the likely overestimation of phenylalanine\nuptake in our study serves to strengthen our conclusion\nthat this amino acid is less preferred by plants than are\nthe simpler N forms, such as glycine.\nIn sum, we argue that the points raised by von Felten\net al. do not alter our main conclusions, which concern\npreferential use of, and competition for, different\nchemical forms of N by plants and microbes. Also,\nwhile they do raise valid points concerning the need for\ncaution in using dual labeled (15N, 13C) stable isotopes\nfor detecting and quantifying direct uptake of amino\nacids by plants, as has as been called for by other\nauthors (e.g., Jones et al. 2005), we do not believe our\nfindings are misleading; rather, we draw cautious\nconclusions from our data which take into account the\nuncertainty about direct uptake that they raise. One key\nissue that the comment that Felten et al. does raise,\nhowever, is the need to develop suitable analytical\ntechniques which enable improved measurement of the\npool size and flux of different amino acids in soil,\nthereby providing more realistic measures of the\navailability of these N forms to plants, and assessment\nof the direct uptake of different N forms by plants.\nLiterature cited\nBardgett, R.
