Introduction \nThe \u201ctwo visual systems\u201d model advanced by Milner, Goodale and their various colleagues \nsuggests that dorsal stream functions should be characterized in terms of sensorimotor \nexploitation of sensory attributes (Milner & Goodale, 1995). These attributes are not restricted to \nspatial features of a target for localization; they include object-based properties such as size and \norientation, important for controlled grasping. Other models, particularly that of Ungerleider and \nMishkin (1982), suggests that the occipito-parietal regions of the dorsal stream are important for \nthe processing of spatial attributes of stimuli (for purposes of spatial perception as well as the \nspatial guidance of actions). \n \nMany studies by us and our colleagues have shown a strong dissociation between using sensory \ninformation for perception and action in the visual form agnosic patient D.F.. There is little \ndisagreement that D.F.\u201fs sensorimotor responsiveness to size, orientation and distance is clearly \nfar better than her perceptual sensitivity to those same visual characteristics. Nevertheless, in \nsome limited contexts her sensitivity to some visuospatial attributes is better than chance, even if \nthe response does not require directed movement to the source of the information (e.g. Carey, \nDijkerman & Milner, 1998; Milner, Dijkerman & Carey, 1999; Murphy, Carey & Goodale, 1998). \nFor example, her distance estimates are appropriately scaled to the physical distance of a \nstimulus, although she consistently underestimates by as much as 40-50% (Carey et al. 1998; \nMon-Williams, Tresilian, McIntosh & Milner, 2001). These results have led to interesting debates \nabout how spatial functions can be fractionated. In the case of our visual agnosic patient D.F., the \nallocentric versus egocentric distinction fits quite well with several experimental outcomes. \n4 \n \nAllocentric spatial attributes relate distinct objects to one another, while egocentric spatial \nattributes relate a single target attribute to a reference point somewhere on the observer\n1\n. \n \nIn a recent paper (Carey, Dijkerman, Murphy, Goodale & Milner, 2006) we expanded on earlier \nwork (Murphy et al., 1998) on the limits of D.F.\u201fs ability to make allocentric spatial judgements. \nIn the later experiments, we showed that requiring a sensorimotor response is not in itself \nsufficient to allow for near-normal localization in pointing. D.F. made aiming movements directly \nto coloured tokens (\u201ctiddlywinks\u201d) on a fixed workspace containing 3 to 5 elements. Her accuracy \nat doing so was excellent, and even extended to multiple movement sequences. In a pantomime-\nlike variation, we required a spatial displacement of the response to a homologous workspace \n(that is, pointing to the place on a blank array corresponding to the location of the specified target \nin the stimulus array). This variant caused D.F. considerable impairment, in spite of unlimited \nviewing time of the stimulus array, which was easily within sight of the displaced workspace. \n \nIn the current investigation, we extended these earlier observations with an additional study. \nAlthough D.F.\u201fs aiming abilities with one hand have been characterized previously (Carey, \nDijkerman & Milner, 1998; Milner, Dijkerman & Carey, 1999), little is known about her capacity \nto move to two different targets simultaneously. D.F.\u201fs good sensorimotor skills may depend on \neye-hand coordination patterns restricted to single targets which she foveates as part of a naturally \nunfolding sensorimotor act. Some bimanual tasks in neurologically-intact participants seem to \nrequire sequential foveations that can precede the hand\u201fs approach to the target by considerable \nlengths of time (e.g. Flanagan, Merritt & Johansson, in 2009). Little is actually known about eye \n                                                 \n1\n Early arguments suggested shoulder centred coordinate schemes for pointing (Soechting, Tillery & Flanders, 1990), \nwhereas more recent accounts suggest that hand movements might be encoded in parieto-frontal circuits in eye\u2013\n5 \n \nmovements or attentional biases to laterally-displaced targets to be pointed at simultaneously with \nboth hands [although see Riek, Tresilian, Mon-Williams, Coppard & Carson (2003) who suggest \na serial saccadic strategy in a stylus aiming task]. \n \nEven if D.F could succeed at a bimanual direct pointing task, we suspected that bimanual \npantomimed pointing would represent a substantial challenge to her. Good performance in the \nbimanual pantomime variant would require D.F. either to encode the two stimulus positions as a \nvector and then translate that vector onto the response array, or to encode each stimulus position \nseparately on the stimulus array and transpose those visuomotor codes to the blank response array \nafter orienting her body towards it. The former strategy requires coding the \u201cvisuospatial gestalt\u201d \nformed by any stimulus pair and translating it into a bimanual motor program; the latter strategy \nwould utilize independent coding of each stimulus location and transforming each into a single, \nseparate unimanual motor program. Given her relatively laborious spatial judgements about inter-\nstimulus distance (Carey et al. 2006: Murphy et al. 1998) with these displays, we reasoned that \nthe translation of a bimanual response in the pantomimed condition would represent a particular \nchallenge to her limited visuospatial skills. The second strategy, like that used in unimanual \npointing, seemed likely to tax her known abilities to use sensorimotor coding to accomplish \ncertain ostensibly perceptual tasks through self-cueing (Dijkerman & Milner, 1997; Murphy, \nRacicot & Goodale, 1996) because she would need to use this approach to generate two responses \nrather than just one. D.F\u201fs performance on this new task was examined after testing movements \nto single targets and multiple target sequences (as reported in Carey et al., 2006). For this study, \n                                                                                                                                                              \ncentred representations (see Crawford, Medendorp & Marotta, 2004 for review). \n6 \n \nwe required her to point to two specified targets at the same time, using her left for one target and \nher right hand for the other. \n \n2. Methods \n2.1 Participants \nD.F. is a right-handed woman who suffered brain damage after accidental carbon monoxide \npoisoning 10 years prior to testing (at which time she was 43 years old). Her lesions are diffuse \nbut are their most dense in occipito-temporal regions of the ventral stream, including area LO \n(Milner et al. 1991; Carey, Harvey & Milner, 1996; James, Culham, Humphrey, Milner, & \nGoodale, 2003; Goodale & Milner, 2004). D.F.\u201fs shape, orientation and face processing \nperception had continued to be very poor at time of testing. Her ability to perform spatial \njudgments is also impaired (Carey et al. 1998; Carey et al. 2006; Murphy et al. 1998; Milner, \nDijkerman & Carey, 1999), although not as dramatically as her judgments about the object-based \nproperties such as orientation and shape. In contrast, her colour vision is relatively spared (Milner \n& Heywood, 1989), which allowed for identification of specific target pairs required for this \nstudy.  \n \nTwo control subjects matched for sex, handedness, and approximate age, with no history of \nvisual, neurological, or psychiatric disturbance were also tested (C.L., age 42, and C.H., age 36).  \n \n2.2 Stimuli \nLike Murphy et al. (1998) and Carey et al. (2006) we used coloured tokens (Tiddlywinks) as \nstimuli because they could be reliably discriminated from one another by D.F., despite her \n7 \n \nperceptual troubles with other types of object identifier such as shape. Nine 21 x 21 cm\n \narrays \n(three each of three, four or five tokens) were used for blocks of direct and pantomimed pointing \ntrials. Two of the arrays were linear, although D.F. did not seem to benefit from this fact in her \nspatial copies of the target arrays (described in Carey et al. 2006).  For the bimanual movements \nrequired in this study, Inter-target distances varied from 33 to 200 mm; inter-target slopes varied \nfrom 12 to 88 degrees.   \n \n2.3 Procedure \nDirect and pantomimed pointing  \nA blank 21 x 21 cm response sheet was presented to the right of the stimulus array, separated by 4 \ncm. The participants were required to make pointing movements with both hands (without \nterminal adjustment after landing) to specified target pairs. In \u201edirect\u201f trials, they pointed directly \nto both specified tokens on the target array. In \u201epantomime\u201f trials, participants were asked to point \nto the two locations on the blank sheet that were identical to the locations of targets on the \nadjacent stimulus array (\u201cas if the array of tokens were placed on top of the blank sheet\u201d). \nJudgements of number of tokens, the pair closest to one another, and the pair most distant from \none another were made for each stimulus array before any pointing responses were called for. \nPantomimed single movements defined by the 3, 4 or 5 token locations, as well as double, triple, \nand (for the four and five place arrays) quadruple and pentuple-step movements were all \nperformed before the bimanual movements (see Carey et al. 2006). As a consequence, all of the \nparticipants had considerable exposure with all of the tokens on each array before the bimanual \nmovements were required. However, pantomimed trials were carried out before any physical \ncontact with the actual target arrays. \n8 \n \nFor the bimanual trials reported here, the experimenter named the pair orally at least two times \nand asked the participant to repeat the target colours aloud twice, while attending to the individual \nitem locations on the target array.  The experimenter then said \u201cthree, two, one, go!\u201d  and \nmanually initiated data collection before the go signal. The same 58 target pairs were used in \npantomime and direct target trials.  D.F. and controls were given several practice trials with the \nfirst two arrays before data collection commenced. Hand movements directly towards the \nstimulus array were not allowed until the direct pointing trials commenced; but eye and head \nmovements between arrays were unrestricted and encouraged. \n \nD.F. was tested in three separate sessions within a five-day period. Control participants C.L. and \nC.H. were tested in two sessions within a three-day period. Sessions were video and audio-\nrecorded from an overhead videocamera.  Participants wore a lightweight infra-red emitting diode \n(IRED) placed on the nail of the index finger of their right and left hands. Movement paths were \nrecorded at 100 Hz using an Optotrak 3020 system (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Canada). \nAfter each session, arrays were replaced on table-marked reference points, and token centre \ncoordinates were recorded. Pantomime response calibrations were achieved by placing the \nstimulus array in the identical position previously occupied by the blank pantomime array. \nMovement onset was defined as a 10 frame increase in resultant velocity from a local minimum, \nwhere the first of these frames exceeded 10 mm\/sec. Movement paths were plotted using \nSigmaplot software (Systat Software, Inc) and were colour-coded to match the appropriate target \nrequired for the sub-movement.  \n \n9 \n \nWe chose to estimate terminal error rather than endpoint error as in the target-directed trials, \nbecause there was a slim possibility that tactile feedback from the token edges might drive subtle \nerror corrections at the end of movement which might not be visible to the naked eye of the \nexperimenter or to the overhead videorecording. Therefore we used X and Y coordinates from \neach finger at a point 50 ms before dropping below the 1 cm level in the Z axis (\u201cup-down\u201d \nrelative to the table surface). After calibration (where the markers of the cube sit slightly above \nthe table surface), the workspace was such that the participants finger markers were at a Z \ncoordinate of slightly less than zero as they rested on the table in their start positions. Effectively \nthis procedure examines accuracy before any contact with the tokens in direct trials was possible \n(see Figure 1 for an example).  \n \nUnfortunately, technical problems with one of the markers and positioning of the workspace \nrelative to the Optotrak resulted in missing makers from one hand or the other in many of D.F.\u201fs \ntrials (although all trials were clearly visible on the videotape from the overhead camera and \nD.F\u201fs performance was consistent throughout the bimanual experiment). Nevertheless, for D.F. \n59 target movements and 62 pantomimed movements contained accurate data for the terminal \nphase of both movements for the calculation of terminal error as discussed above. We used the \nidentical trials in the control participants, unless they were missing data and then a substitution \nwas made from another pair of targets or pantomimes. We were also able to use these trials to \nexamine the synchrony of the landing phase across the two hands. \n10 \n \n \nFig. 1. Movement accuracy was estimated from a point 50 ms before the finger IRED dropped below 10 \nmm in height.  The lower inner panel depicts the X and Y reach paths on this particular trial by D.F.. The \nupper small panel shows the Z profile of the longer movement (in black) as a function of time. The larger \nfigure illustrates the last half of the movement in Z. The arrow indicates the frame whose X and Y \ncoordinates were used for calculating movement accuracy.  \n \n3. Results \nAs we have reported previously, D.F. performed as well as controls on judgments of nearest and \nfurthest pairs (13\/18, versus C.L.:15\/18, C.H. 14\/18), and counted all of the arrays successfully \n(she did have to self-correct on one trial). Every one of her errors was made to the second closest \n(or second furthest, as appropriate for the question) pair for the particular array. Nevertheless \nobservations during testing were confirmed by examination of the videotapes, which showed a \nmuch more slavish strategy in D.F.: she invariably identified each colour on the array in turn, and \nthen would repeat the sequence aloud before reporting her decision. She also self-corrected on the \nfirst array, after a long series of movements and copying the array with her own set of tokens (i.e. \nafter multiple opportunities to enumerate, rather than subitize\n2\n the arrays).   \n                                                 \n2\n Neurologically-intact people make very accurate numerosity judgements for arrays of five or less without appearing \nto count them serially, a process referred to as \u201csubitizing\u201d (e.g. Trick & Pylyshyn, 1994). Observations in this study \nsuggest that D.F. cannot subitize even arrays of only 3 targets. \n11 \n \n \nFig. 2. Sample bimanual movements for the same target and pantomime arrays for D.F. (top panels) and \ncontrol participants C.H. and C.L.  Reaches directed to tokens on the stimulus array appear in the left \ncolumn, pantomimed reaches to homologous positions on the blank array appear in the right columns. The \nassociated velocity profiles for both fingers appear below each graph. Reaches to red (far left) and black \ntargets (far right) were accurately performed by all three participants in the target trial. (Shading of the \nreach trajectories match the associated velocity profiles and not the required targets). Note that the reach \ndeviation in control C.L.\u2019s pantomime trial was not a late adjustment based on endpoint accuracy relative to \nthe target (as she was reaching to a blank array).  \n \nFigure 2 illustrates a sample target and pantomime trial from D.F. and the control participants. \nMean terminal error for direct and pantomimed bimanual reaches appear in Figure 3, collapsing \nacross hands as the error patterns were quite similar\n3. D.F.\u201fs terminal errors were compared to \nthose of the controls using Crawford & Howell's  (1998) modified t-test for small control group \nsize (the rationale of advantages of are discussed in Carey et al. 2006; see also Crawford & \n                                                 \n3\n For direct reaching, DF right hand (rh) error=13.4 mm, left hand (lh) =10.3 mm (CH rh=8.6 mm, lh=8.8 mm; CL \nrh=8.4 mm, lh=9.4 mm). For pantomimed reaching DF rh=32.9 mm, lh=40.9 mm (CH rh=15.9 mm, lh=11.2 mm; CL \nrh=11.5 mm, lh=13.4 mm). Unfortunately the appropriate test of the differences between the two hands, using \n12 \n \nGarthwaite, 2002). We used one-tailed tests because the null hypothesis was that D.F. would \nperform more poorly than the two control subjects. In direct pointing, D.F.\u201fs terminal errors were \nnot significantly different than controls (t(1)=3.65, p >0.05, one or two-tailed). She was \nsignificantly worse than controls at pantomimed pointing (t(1)=112.6, p < 0.0005, one-tailed). \n \nFig. 3. Mean terminal error for target and pantomimed pointing. X and Y coordinates were taken from a \npoint 50 ms before the movement was less than 1 cm above the table surface.  \n \nWe also examined accuracy in direct and pantomimed pointing by calculating the inter-finger \ndistance and orientation at movement termination (Fig 4), and comparing these with inter-target \ndistance and orientation. These data appear in Figure 5. Remarkably, D.F. was not significantly \ndifferent in mean inter-finger orientation error in either direct (D.F.=4.32 deg versus mean control \n3.02 deg, t(1)=5.59, p>0.05 one- tailed) or pantomimed pointing (D.F.=11.11 deg versus mean \ncontrol 6.60 deg, t(1)=4.18, p>0.05 one-tailed). On inter-finger orientation, D.F. was profoundly \nimpaired in pantomimed pointing (D.F.=50.45 mm, control mean=10.69 mm, t(1)=463.7, \np<0.002 one-tailed) but not in direct pointing (M=7.50 mm, control mean=7.72 mm, t(1)=-1.50, \np>0.05 one-tailed). \n                                                                                                                                                              \nCrawford & Garthwaite\u201fs  (2005) procedures for testing for a double dissociation in a single patient require n-2 \ndegrees of freedom which we do not have with our control sample of 2 participants.  \n13 \n \n \nFig. 4. Comparison of terminal inter-finger with inter-target distance and orientation.  A sample movement \nfrom a control participant was digitized and converted into a line drawing. The inter-finger distance is \nspecified by a dot-dashed line ending with the middle of each finger\u2019s IRED (open circles). The inter-target \ndistance and orientation are depicted with the dashed line. A direct reach is depicted; for pantomimed \nreaches calibration coordinates for calculating inter-target distance and orientation were obtained by \nplacing the direct array on top of the blank pantomimed array. \n \n \nIn spite of her poor accuracy in the pantomimed movements on two of our three measures, D.F. \nstill showed a strong relationship between both the inter-finger distance and orientation in the \nterminal phase of the reaches and the actual target distance and orientation. The correlations \nbetween inter-finger distance and target distance were significant in both direct (r=0.98, p<0.001) \nand pantomimed (r=0.82, p<0.001) pointing conditions. Nevertheless this relationship in the \npantomimed condition was not as strong as that seen in the controls (C.H. direct: r=0.99, \np<0.001; C.H. pantomime r=0.96, p<0.001; C.L. direct r=0.98, p<0.001; C.L. pantomime r=0.94, \np<0.001). Consistent with her overall orientation accuracy, D.F. performed as well as to he two \ncontrols for the relationship between terminal inter-finger orientation and inter-stimulus \norientation in both direct (D.F. r=0.99; C.H. r=0.99; C.L. r=0.99, all p\u201fs <0.001) and pantomimed \npointing (D.F. r=0.97, C.H. r=0.99, C.L. r=0.98, all p\u201fs < 0.001). \n \nWe also had the opportunity to examine temporal coordination of this set of movements in D.F. \nand the controls. Because we recorded the time at which movement trajectory reached the Z \n14 \n \nthreshold, the timing of her arrival at two targets could be compared to that of the controls. The \nmean absolute values of the temporal differences were slightly longer in D.F. than the controls \n(DF: 79 ms; CH: 23 ms; CL 33 ms) and the two times were highly correlated in all participants, \nalthough less so in D.F. [direct, r(23)=0.73, p<0.05; pantomimed r(21)=0.98, p<0.01] than in \nC.H. [direct, r(23)=0.73, p<0.05; pantomimed r(21)=0.98, p<0.01] or C.L. [direct r(21)=.98, \np<0.01; pantomimed r(21)=0.98, p<0.01]. D.F.\u201fs durations (right hand 709 ms, left hand 661 ms4) \nwere slower than C.H. (right hand 446 ms, left hand 418 ms) and C.L (right hand 490 ms, left \nhand 478 ms). There is a suggestion in these data that the difference between her two hands (48 \nms) is larger than in the controls (C.H. 28 ms; C.L. 12 ms), although difference scores cannot be \ncompared statistically without a larger control sample (Crawford & Garthwaite, 2005; 2007). \n \n4. Discussion \nThe current study extended our previous experiments on allocentrically versus egocentrically \ndriven pointing in a patient with visual form agnosia. In spite of extensive work on pointing and \ngrasping in D.F., her capacity to generate accurate bimanual movements, even in direct egocentric \nconditions was previously unknown\n5\n. We suspected that in the allocentric conditions of the \npantomime task, neurologically-intact participants could treat the two targets as a vector with a \ndiscrete spatial position (relative to the edges and\/or centre of the square array), much like they \ncan treat the entire array as a pattern which leads to their metrically accurate copying (Carey et al. \n2006). This kind of strategy appeared to be unavailable for copying in D.F., so we hypothesized a \n                                                 \n4\n Although there is a suggestion of some left parietal damage in D.F. (James et al. 2003), in our previous unimanual \npointing and grasping experiments D.F. always chose to point her right hand. Her good performance in those studies \nargues strongly against any apraxic or ataxic disturbance. \n5\n M. Mon Williams, R.D. McIntosh and two of the authors are currently preparing a manuscript that describes some \nlimitations in D.F.\u201fs ability to grasp targets bimanually using the paradigm described by Bingham, Hughes & Mon-\nWilliams (2008). \n15 \n \nheavy cost on bimanual movement accuracy in the pantomimed condition. This is indeed what we \nfound (Figs. 3 and 5). She was significantly worse on both the terminal and distance error \nmeasures. However, she was (statistically, at least) unimpaired on the orientation error measure, \neven in the pantomimed pointing. Previously, we found that D.F. showed preserved orientation \nbut not distance coding when two holes in a transparent disc had to be grasped using forefinger \nand thumb (Dijkerman, Milner & Carey, 1998). In the present study, preservation of inter-\nstimulus orientation in pantomimed pointing suggests that D.F. may be able to prepare bimanual \nmovements to the specified pair on the stimulus array and then translate those movements to the \npantomimed array. As in the disc grasping study, in this translation process orientation is \npreserved but inter-stimulus distance is not (Fig. 5).  \n \nFig. 5. Mean orientation and distance errors for D.F., C.H. and C.L..  A. Orientation errors were defined as \nthe unsigned difference (absolute value) of each participant\u2019s inter-finger orientation (before contact with \nthe table surface) with the orientation of the targets. B. Distance errors were calculated as the unsigned \ndifference between inter-finger distance (before contact with the table surface) and inter-target distance. \nD.F. is only significantly impaired for distance errors in the pantomimed pointing condition. \n16 \n \nAlthough little is known about the attentional and eye-movement-related processes that allow for \naccurate bimanual movement, the yoking of the two hands in terms of onset and end times has \nbeen the subject of considerable research (Wiesendanger, Kaluzny, Kazennikov, Palmeri & \nPerrig, 1993). D.F. shows some evidence of coupling of the two hands. Although the terminal \ntimes of her two fingers are less well correlated than in the controls, the average difference of 79 \nms between her two hands (particularly given her longer overall movement times) does not \nsuggest an obvious serial strategy, whereby one hand arrives at its target well in advance of the \nother, allowing for overt or covert attention resources to be re-deployed to the other hand or target \n(cf Riek et al. 2003). D.F. seemed to be planning and executing bimanual movements in a manner \nsimilar to that of controls. \n \nIn these free viewing conditions with constantly visible targets, D.F. seems capable of coding the \ncategorical relationships of any two tokens with some accuracy; for example, her copies tend to \nbe quite accurate in terms of the left to right and bottom to top ordering of the tokens (Murphy et \nal., 1998; Carey et al., 2006). Observation of her performance suggests that she can use this sort \nof strategy for any two target positions in spite of her poor ability to compare the patterns of a \ntarget array and a copy. The array sizes we used in this study were small, therefore categorical \n(above, below, left, right) codes could account for hand landing orientations that are correlated \nwithactual inter-stimulus orientations. Nevertheless we have to acknowledge that the near perfect \ncorrelations in direct, and especially pantomime conditions, (as well as preserved orientation \naccuracy) seem rather high for this sort of explanation. She was much less sensitive to the metric \ninter-stimulus distances than the controls in the pantomime task, as seen in both her terminal and \n17 \n \ndistance error data and lower correlation between inter-finger distance and inter-stimulus \ndistance. \n \nHer relative successes in the pantomimed trials have been the subject of some discussion by us in \nthe unimanual movement and copying tasks used in our previous studies. We have known for \nsome time that, under certain conditions, D.F.\u201fs perceptual responses can be cued by the explicit \npreparation of a manual act. For example, Murphy et al. (1996) required D.F. to reach out and \ngrasp a specified target from a rectangle and a square. They found that she selected the target \ncorrectly more often than when she simply responded left or right (the perceptual task). On close \ninspection of videorecordings, they found evidence of late trajectory corrections for many of her \nreaching trials. These data suggest that D.F. is somehow able to use a motor-related signal to \ninform her choices on this task. Two of us (Dijkerman & Milner, 1997) examined D.F.\u201fs abilities \nto copy oriented lines (a \u201cperceptual task\u201d in that the response, as in pantomimed pointing, was \ndistant from the visual stimulus driving it) under various conditions. They found that asking her \nto make her drawing response without delay greatly worsened her performance, and suggested \nthat D.F. needed time to use an internal self-cuing strategy whereby sensorimotor preparation \ncould prime an apparently \u201cperceptual\u201d choice. It may be that in the present study inter-manual \norientation lends itself more readily to visuomotor representation of this kind than does inter-\nmanual distance. Such an account also suggests (albeit tentatively) that a bimanual encoding \nstrategy is available to D.F. for this task, albeit of a sensorimotor cross-cueing variety.  For \nexample, a \u201cmotor image\u201d of making an oriented movement between the two stimuli might be \nrather similar to the motor imagery that Dijkerman and Milner (1997) suggested D.F. might have \nbeen using to mediate her successful orientation copying performance. \n18 \n \n \nIt should be noted that the above finding of Dijkerman and Milner (1997) on delayed copying is \nquite different from the effects of delay on D.F.\u201fs reaching and grasping, where performance \ndeclines markedly (e.g. Goodale, Jakobson & Keillor, 1994; Milner et al., 1999; Goodale, \nWestwood & Milner, 2004. In the pantomimed trials reported here and in Carey et al. (2006), the \ntask required participants to extract spatial information from the stimulus arrays, some of which \nmight decay during the time between stimulus inspection and the pantomimed response (which \nwas controlled by the experimenter providing a countdown before a go signal). Her poor \nperformance on pantomimed pointing measured by terminal and distance errors suggests that a \nperceptual strategy available to the controls was not available to her. As noted by Murphy et al. \n(1998) and Carey et al. (2006), D.F.\u201fs slavish reproductions of the arrays relative to controls \nsuggest that she cannot code the arrays as a \u201cgestalt\u201d which can be carefully compared to the \ntargets. \n \nHer high levels of skill in these bimanual trials surprised us to some extent. There are hints in the \nbimanual aiming literature that in some tasks at least, serial strategies are used in bimanual \naiming (e.g. Riek et al. 2003). Honda (1982) suggests that there are lateral biases in processing, \nwith the target being approached preferentially by the dominant hand in relatively unconstrained \nconditions. Remarkably, there seems to be no previous experiment where the kinematics of \nbimanual movements have been examined while participants were required to fixate a central \nnon-target position. Assuming participants could manage this without catastrophic effects on \naccuracy, the possibility of covert asymmetries even with overt attentional shifts remains \nrelatively under-explored. Diedrichson, Nambisan, Kennerley and Ivry (2004) suggest that the \n19 \n \nvisual control for the two hands can approach complete independence, as the hands can \nindependently adjust for perturbations to both targets within the same trial. Clearly different task \nconstraints within specific grasping (e.g. Bingham et al., 2008) or reaching tasks, will have \nprofound effects on movement synchrony or asynchrony (as will the criteria that different \nlaboratories use for describing movements as relatively synchronous or asynchronous). In fact, the \ntype of bimanual pointing trials that we have used here is unusual in that the targets were \nspecified well in advance of the required reach, and in that participants were not just allowed to \novertly attend to both targets repeatedly before a go signal; they were actively encouraged to do \nso. And yet, spatial positions for each target pair varied from trial to trial, although participants \nreached to specific targets on more than one occasion for all of the arrays. These task differences \nmay not be trivial. For example, Diedrichsen, Hazeltine, Kennerley & Ivry (2001) found that \ndirectly cued target pairs (such as suddenly appearing targets) may result in more synchrony \nbetween movements by each hand compared to target pairs that are cued more abstractly (in ways \narguably comparable to the verbal instruction of target pairs used in this study). \n \nAs noted by Carey et al. (2006), further examination of D.F.\u201fs limits on bimanual direct and \npantomimed pointing are called for. Although it is difficult to record her eye movements (due to \nthe characteristics of her eyelids rather than any feature of her neurological difficulties), touch-\nscreen technology could allow for bimanual tasks to be carried out in a more \u201eopen loop\u201f fashion. \nFor example, controlling presentation times of the direct array and requiring a more rapid \nresponse to the pantomimed array could be used to eliminate any sensorimotor cueing effects. \nChanges in shape of the two arrays might help demonstrate the use (or failure to use) metric cues \nabout stimulus positions relative to the edges of direct pointing space. Limitations of parallel \n20 \n \nversus serial processes could be addressed in a direct aiming task by using staggered stimulus \npresentations. The spatial intolerance of her sensorimotor responsiveness could be investigated \nwith smaller displacements than the current distance between the direct and pantomimed arrays. \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe present data confirm the difficulties that D.F. has with allocentric visuospatial tasks, even \nwhen the response allows her to make ballistic aiming movements. While the deficit is not \ncomplete, it should be borne in mind that D.F.\u201fs ventral stream lesion is likewise incomplete, \nbeing concentrated largely in the shape-processing area LO (James et al., 2003). \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by grant no. 052443 from the Wellcome Trust to A.D.M.
