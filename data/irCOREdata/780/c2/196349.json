The survey documented most aspects of the school-\nleavers\u2019 lives, however, the majority of the data from this 'Young Worker\nProject' has remained unanalysed and unpublished for nearly forty years.\nRecently 851 of the original interview schedules were uncovered and, as part\nof a broader ESRC funded project, re-analysis has commenced.\nLittle is known about the transition to work at this time and what research\ndoes exist has focused on the experience of boys. Using data from the\noriginal survey, which included interviews with 260 girls, this paper\nexamines the female experience of the transition from school to work,\nconcluding that gender played a significant role in influencing the way in\nwhich the school to work transition was experienced.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n3\nIntroduction\nThe transition from school to work has been a major focus of research on\nyoung people since the early 1960s (Wilson 1957; Carter 1962, 1963, 1969;\nDouglas 1964; Watts 1967; Willis 1977). However, such research tended to\nfocus almost exclusively on the experience of young males in the transition\nfrom school to work, leaving the female experience at this time largely\nunexplored by sociologists.  Very little comparable material examining the\ntransition for girls exists.  As Ashton and Field (1976:35) acknowledged in\nthe mid-1970s\n\u2018\u2026at present there is a marked absence of research into and knowledge\nabout the perspectives and experiences of young women\u2026\u2019.\nIt was not until the early 1980s and the publication of Griffin\u2019s study,\n\u2018Typical Girls\u2019, which she describes as\n \u2018\u2026a sort of female version of Paul Willis\u2019s research\u2026\u2019 (Griffin, 1985:2)\nthat this research gap began to be addressed. However, in common with\nother research on female transitions which had aimed to redress the existing\ngender imbalance (Wallace, 1986; Sharpe, 1976, 1994), Griffin\u2019s research\nwas carried out at a time when fundamental changes in the youth labour\nmarket were taking place. The context of the research was one in which\nrising youth unemployment had become a key issue and as such the girls had\na whole set of very different concerns to those leaving school in the early\n1960s (Roberts, 1995:89).\nThe aim of this paper is to retrospectively contribute to the debate on the\ngendered nature of school to work transitions by examining the experience\nof girls in the transition process during the 1960s. Using previously\nunanalysed data collected for the little known \u2018Adjustment of Young Workers\nto Work Situations and Adult Roles\u2019 project carried out at the University of\nLeicester in the early 1960s, the paper aims to examine the way in which\ngender impacted on transitions during this period.\nIn the next section of this paper a brief background to the Young Worker\nProject is provided alongside an account of our methodological approach.\nWe go on to look in more detail at the historical context in which the\noriginal research took place, highlighting the ways in which this impacted\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n4\nupon the experience of these girls.  Next we examine the girls\u2019 reflections on\ntheir education and their thoughts about work before they left school. This\nleads us to consider the aspirations held by the girls, the reality of\noccupational choice and the process by which they obtained employment.\nHere we also examine the extent to which the guidance and advice offered\nboth at school and home impacted upon job choice. We continue by looking\nat the long-term plans held by the respondents and consider the extent to\nwhich the prospect of marriage and motherhood impacted upon early career\nchoices.  This leads us to conclude in the final section, that although this\ncohort of school-leavers did not face the later problems of unemployment,\ntheir transitions from school to work were often far from simple.\nBackground and Methodology\nThe data for this paper is taken from a research project on the transition from\nschool to work carried out by a team of researchers, led by Norbert Elias, at\nthe University of Leicester in the early 1960s. The original research project\nwas awarded a grant for \u00a315,000 by the Department of Scientific and\nIndustrial Research  (D.S.I.R) in 1962. The aim of this little known\n\u2018Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles\u2019 project\nwas to explore how young people experienced work and adjusted their lives\nto the work role. Five specific areas of enquiry emerged \u2013 adjustment to\nrelationships with older workers and supervisors; adjustment to job\nproblems; adjustment to role as workers; adjustment to role as \u2018money-\nearner\u2019 in home relations; and adjustment to role as \u2018money-earner\u2019 in\nleisure time. The data was to be collected via interviews with a sample of\nyoung people drawn from the Youth Employment Office index of all\nLeicester school-leavers from the summer and Christmas of 1960 and the\nsummer and Christmas of 1962. This sample was then further stratified by\nthe school attended (secondary, technical, grammar or other), by the size of\nfirm entered in first job and whether they were trainees or not. The sample\nwas divided up into five sub-groups and using a table of random numbers a\ntarget sample of 1150 young people was identified. The sub-groups are\nsummarised in Table 1, below.\nAs Table 1 reveals, the number of girls in the target sample was significantly\nlower than the number of boys, in fact under half of the sample was to be\nfemale. In addition, the sample of girls, unlike that of the boys, did not\ninclude any who had a further year of education. One possible reason for the\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n5\nlower female sample emerges from minutes taken at the original project\nmeetings in 1962.  These indicate that this was a controversial issue amongst\nmembers of the research team at the start of the project and that a suggestion\nwas even made to omit girls altogether.\nTable 1 Sample Descriptions and Composition\nGroup Original Target Sample Archive\nSample\nPilot Study 28 0\nPractice* - 16\nActual Study\n\u2018A\u2019 \u2013 boys who had left school in summer 330 243\nor Christmas 1962, with less than one\nyear\u2019s further education \n\u2018B\u2019 \u2013 boys who had left school in summer 160 130\nor Christmas 1962, with more than one\nyear\u2019s further education\n\u2018C\u2019 \u2013 boys who had left school in summer 300 202\nor Christmas 1960, with less than one\nyear\u2019s further education\n\u2018D\u2019 - girls who had left school in summer 200 155\nor Christmas 1962, with less than one\nyear\u2019s further education\n\u2018E\u2019 - girls who had left school in summer 160 105\nor Christmas 1960, with less than one\nyear\u2019s further education\nTotals 1150 (28)\u2020 851(16) \u2020\nNote: * The practice schedules appeared to be \u2018dry-run\u2019 interviews with actual\nrespondents.

The interview schedule was semi-structured but the\nresponses tended to be open-ended, textual and reflective in nature. A series\nof 82 questions in five sections were asked, covering topics including work,\nfamily and expenditure, leisure, and school. The interviewers were asked to\nrecord responses verbatim if possible and always in as full detail as the time\nand circumstances allowed.\nThe fieldwork began in 1962 and ended in 1964. However, at the start of this\nperiod Elias, the project director, left Leicester to take up a post at the\nUniversity of Ghana. Whilst attempts were made to direct the project\nremotely via a research committee, correspondence between Elias and the\nresearch team indicates that insurmountable problems with working practice,\nacademic direction and the researchers\u2019 \u2018right\u2019 to publish had emerged\n(Goodwin and O\u2019Connor, 2002). By the time the fieldwork was completed,\nthe research team had resigned and the project effectively ended. With the\nexception of Ashton and Field (1976) who used a sample of the cases, the\nbulk of the data was never analysed or published. In the mid-1970s Ashton\narchived the data, where it remained untouched until 851 of the original\ninterview schedules were recently rediscovered.\nThe research findings presented here are based on the 260 schedules of\ninterviews completed with girls who had left school one year prior to the\ninterview and were aged between fifteen and eighteen.  Most were working\nin their first jobs though there was evidence of occupational mobility already\nwith some having entered their second or third job by the time they were\ninterviewed.\nGender and Employment: the Historical Context\nAt the start of the 1960s, when the Young Worker Project was carried out,\nunemployment was rare and jobs for school-leavers were both widely\navailable and relatively easy to obtain (Kiernan 1992; Roberts 1995; Unwin\nand Wellington 2001). As a consequence of this, the crucial transition from\neducation into employment was seen as a\n\u2018simple, predominant, and one-step transition from school to work\u2019\n(Coles, 1995:35)\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n7\nup until the mid-1970s and little research into the youth labour market in\n1960s and 1970s was carried out (Roberts, 1995).\nThe research which did take place during the 1960s and 1970s placed\nparticular emphasis on the transitional experiences of boys.  The school to\nwork transition of girls was given less importance due to their assumed\nultimate primary location in the domestic, rather than commercial sphere\n(Gaskell, 1983). As such, girls were expected to be more concerned with the\nprospect of marriage and motherhood and to anticipate that they would\nexperience prolonged periods of economic inactivity when they would be\nsupported by their husbands. During this period the trend for girls,\nparticularly amongst those perceived to be less academically able, was to\nleave school at the earliest opportunity in order to take low skill jobs\nrequiring few or no qualifications, often in factories or shops.  The\nprevailing attitude was that girls would give up work once married and\nsettled with a family because there was little reason for them to return to the\njob market given the type of low status jobs previously held.  They were,\nhowever, expected to enter the labour market for the intervening period.\nData collected for the Young Worker Project suggests that amongst female\nschool-leavers in the 1960s transitions were not always simple and although\njobs were available these were often not the type of jobs which the girls\nwanted to obtain. Whilst marriage and motherhood were seen as inevitable\nfor many, they did also expect to continue paid employment in the future. As\nsuch the girls attached a great deal of importance to the jobs they took\ninitially and were not afraid to seek different employment if expectations\nwere not realised.\nIn the following section we go on to look at the expectations of this group of\ngirls before they entered the labour market. We begin with their reflections\non education and school life and their thoughts on the prospect of leaving\nschool.\nLeaving School\nIn common with findings from later research about girls\u2019 transitions (Griffin,\n1984, 1985; Sharpe, 1994) the data reveals that like the boys in the study\n(Goodwin and O\u2019Connor, 2001), the majority were keen to leave, often\nexplaining in response to the question \u2018what did you feel about school while\nyou were still at school?\u2019  that they had not liked school:\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n8\nI didn\u2019t like school very much. It just was a bore, dragged on, just didn\u2019t suit\nme at all.\nCouldn\u2019t bear school - hated it. Disliked everything - I was fed up every\nminute I was there. I was really glad to leave.\nI wanted to leave. I didn\u2019t like school and wanted to go to work.\nHowever, not all the girls had such negative reflections on their experience\nof education.  As Carter (1963) found amongst the school-leavers in his\nsample, some had enjoyed school and had been less keen to leave:\nIt were lovely at school. Let\u2019s face it, I were really good and top of the\nschool and somebody, but now I\u2019m at work.\nIf I\u2019d have stayed I\u2019d have got a better education. I liked school\ntremendously, I didn\u2019t want to leave.\nFor others there was an ambivalence at the thought of leaving school, almost\nan unquestioning acceptance of the next stage of the life cycle:\nI didn't sob me socks off, or put the flags out, just took it that I was leaving,\nsaid goodbye and left like.\nDidn\u2019t want to do it at first - quite liked school and thought about all the\nlovely holidays you\u2019ve got. But just have to think\u2026got to leave at sometime\nmight just as well get used to the idea.\nMany felt that school had become a \u2018waste of time\u2019 in their final year and\nthat they were largely being taught subjects which were irrelevant to their\nlives ahead. This sentiment may have been influenced by the fact that most\nof the girls had secured employment before leaving school and knew that for\nthe jobs they were entering they did not need to further their education:\nI wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay on for GCE. It would have been a wasted\nyear really.\nBecause I\u2019d learnt what I wanted for this job - I couldn\u2019t have learned\nanymore for the job itself - I\u2019d  only have learned more Geog. & History\nand you don\u2019t need it really.\nI was sorry to leave my friends, but I didn't like school - felt as though I was\nlearning a lot of things that I didn't need to know.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n9\nI don't know, I didn't like school. They used to learn us things I don't think\nhelped us, like PT and games, social studies, RI, I don't see how that's\nhelped us.\nIt was not until they had started paid employment that some girls began to\nfeel more strongly about the importance of education. As Willis (1977:107)\nsuggests \u2018\u2026ironically as the shop floor becomes a prison, education is seen\nretrospectively and hopelessly as the only escape\u2019.  The respondents in our\nsample were asked the question \u2018do you wish you had stayed on longer at\nschool?\u2019 and their responses, below, illustrate Willis\u2019 argument:\nI wanted to leave when I was at school. But when I was at work I wanted to\ngo back to school. I wish I had taken my GCE.\nHalf of me does, half of me doesn\u2019t.  I\u2019d like to have a career as an air\nhostess, I\u2019d learn languages and I\u2019d like to be on international GPO\nswitchboard.\nThe data suggests that some of the girls would have liked to stay longer at\nschool and had understood how important further qualifications were in the\npursuit of \u2018good\u2019 jobs. As the quotes below illustrate, the education system\ndid appear to have failed this group, by not offering the opportunities that\nthe girls desired.\nI would have liked to have taken GCE but you weren\u2019t allowed to take it.\nI\u2019d have liked to have stayed on. I\u2019d have liked to have got a better job\nreally, got on, get more.\nFor many of our sample, whether they were looking forward to leaving\nschool or not there was a certain fear and uncertainty about what lay ahead:\nI wanted to leave school, but I was frightened about starting work.\nI wasn't glad to be leaving. I liked school but I wanted to get a job. But I\nwas a bit worried about what things would be like - what the people would\nbe like and if I would get on alright.\nThe doubts the girls had about leaving school were often not associated with\ntheir education, rather with their social lives which they anticipated they\nwould miss most. Friendships were very important to them whilst still at\nschool and the thought of losing these relationships was a concern for many:\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n10\nAt first I was looking forward to it, but later I was sorry to be leaving some\nof my friends.\nUsed to just die for the day when I left, but when it came I didn't like\nleaving all my school friends.\nWanted to leave until last day, felt awful leaving friends, felt bad about it till\nstarted work, after two weeks forgot about it.\nWhat emerges from these quotes is that whatever their feelings about leaving\nschool, the majority were keen to start work and were looking forward to\ntheir new lives, particularly the prospect of earning money and becoming\nmore independent. Indeed, money was the single most important factor\nwhich seemed to override all other positive aspects of starting work:\nNo I just wanted to leave to earn my own money; to buy own clothes.\nFabulous, I thought it was a great idea. (Why?) Because I thought I would get more\nclothes, more of everything.\nThe sense that they had a new found freedom also pleased many of the girls\nand this was associated with being treated more like an adult, having more\nmoney of their own and feeling less \u2018controlled\u2019 than they had at school.\nGriffin (1985) found that girls in her study looked forward in particular to\nbeing treated as adults, feeling that at school they were still seen as children\nand treated as such. When the Leicester sample were asked the question \u2018is\nthere anything you like about being at work compared to being at school?\u2019\nmany of the girls also cited their new \u2018adult\u2019 identities as being a positive\nfactor:\nAt school you were always told things, you were treated as a child. But at\nwork they make you feel old and they leave you alone.\nI think you\u2019re looked upon more as a grown up than you are at school. You\nhave more to spend.\nTreated as an adult. More freedom\nI think you have more freedom at work than at school. Your parents treat\nyou as an adult rather than as a child - they leave you to make decisions.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n11\nJob Aspirations\nWhilst they were still at school the girls were, then, eagerly anticipating the\nperceived freedom working life would bring.  Many had thought a great deal\nabout their futures and had a clear idea of the type of job they wanted and\nequally those that they did not want.  In the following section we go on to\nlook at the aspirations of the Leicester school-leavers whilst they were still\nin full-time education and examine the extent to which these ambitions were\nor were not achieved. We begin by looking in more detail at the type of\nemployment the girls were keen to avoid.\nHistorically female school-leavers have not had a particularly wide range of\noccupational choice and the majority have tended to enter only a few sectors,\nwhere female employment was readily available; namely, factories, offices\nand shops (Griffin, 1984, 1985; Sharpe, 1994).  At the time when this\nresearch was carried out the Leicester labour market was extremely buoyant.\nEmployment was widely available and unemployment was not an issue\nwhich concerned the respondents. In the 1960s Leicester was a relatively\nprosperous Midlands city with a particular abundance of jobs in textiles and\nthe respondents were well aware of the employment opportunities for\nwomen which were primarily located in factories manufacturing knitwear,\nhosiery, boots and shoes.  However, factory work was spurned by many of\nthese girls because such work was seen as boring, dirty and hard.\nRespondents talked about the high levels of noise and expressed fears that\nthey would feel \u2018trapped\u2019, rather as they had felt at school.  There was also a\nview that factory work was \u2018low class\u2019 and the people who worked in\nfactories were \u2018rough\u2019. The quotes below were given in answer to the\nquestion \u2018Was there any job you didn\u2019t want to go in to when you were at\nschool?\nFactory.  I just don\u2019t like being closed up, obeying the whistle, etc.\nYou\u2019re too hot in a factory, you\u2019re closed in, it\u2019s too noisy. When we went\nround the shoe factory it was very hot and noisy.\nA factory.  The work people are rough and the work is monotonous.\nFactory.  I thought it was a low class job.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n12\nA factory. The noise. I didn\u2019t think the people were my type. I suppose I am\na snob. Most of the people in a factory are illiterate.\nThis attitude towards factory work was not confined to Leicester. Griffin\n(1985:100) found that amongst her school-leavers in Birmingham a job in a\nfactory was perceived to be \u2018boring, insecure and unpleasant \u2026 \u201cnot a nice\njob for a girl\u201d\u2019. Similarly, amongst Wallace\u2019s (1986) respondents in Kent,\nfactory work had a poor image, despite the potential for earning high wages\nin this environment.  For those in our sample who expressed an interest in\npursuing a factory-based occupation the high earnings were a key\nmotivation, as the responses to the question \u2018was there any job you wanted\nto go into when you were at school?\u2019 illustrate:\nI just wanted to be an overlocker, I thought it was a good job.\nCorah\u2019s (hosiery factory). Heard money was good.\nShoes, Everybody told me the shoes were better paid than the hosiery - that\nwas main reason I went.\nHosiery, I had heard there was good money to be earned and it was a useful\ntrade.\nOverlocking (Why?) I think everybody wants to do overlocking.  You hear\nmore about overlocking than any other thing in the hosiery and everybody\nreckons overlocking earns good money.\nGiven that factory work was not considered to be desirable for many girls in\nour sample it is logical to assume that as other studies have found, office\nwork would be a more popular choice (Sharpe, 1994). In Sharpe\u2019s London-\nbased 1970s\u2019 research she found that office work was the career of choice\nfor many and only two of her respondents expected to become factory\nworkers.  However, although some of our respondents were keen to take\noffice work it was not as popular a choice as may have been expected.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for this. Firstly, this research\nwas carried out at a time when factory work was still the predominant\nemployment opportunity in the city and office work was not as widely\navailable as it later became. As Ashton et al. (1988) note, Leicester, as a\nbase for manufacturing, had a lower proportion of white-collar jobs available\nthan other cities. For this reason it is possible that many girls had not\nnecessarily considered office work as a possibility in the city.  Secondly,\noffice work had historically required a relatively high standard of education\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n13\nand there was certainly a perception in this sample that office work was still\nhard to obtain.  As the quotes below given in response to the question \u2018was\nthere any job you didn\u2019t want to go in to when you were at school?\u2019 reveal,\nsome girls did not think that they were \u2018clever\u2019 enough to work in an office\nand others thought that life in an office would be very tedious:\nAn office.  I haven\u2019t got the brains.\nOffice work. Wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. Wouldn\u2019t be brainy\nenough. I\u2019d had enough of school. It reminded me too much of\nschool you know.\nDidn\u2019t think I was clever enough from a secondary modern\nschool.\nOffice work.  I didn\u2019t fancy sitting at an office desk all day.\nDidn\u2019t want office work.  I think it would be a boring job\nThe girls in the sample then had a good idea of the type of jobs that they\nwere not keen to enter. Alongside this they also held a range of career\naspirations.  Having left school and started work some 12 months previously\nthe girls were asked in the interview to reflect back upon their original career\naspirations.  Their thoughts on this allow us to look in some detail at the\nextent to which aspirations matched reality for girls leaving school in the\n1960s. Table 2 lists the range of jobs cited in response to the question: \u2018Was\nthere any job you wanted to go into when you were at school?\u2019:\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n14\nTable 2:  Career Aspirations\nJob Description No. of Girls\nHairdressing 56\nOffice Work (included wide range, e.g.\ntelephonist, receptionist)\n36\nWorking with children 24\nDoctor\/nurse 19\nFactory (over-locker, hosiery worker) 19\nShop work 18\nWorking with animals\/on a farm 14\nArtist (commercial) 10\nTeacher 9\nDressmaker 8\nAir Hostess 7\nWindow dresser 6\nPolice force 3\nModel 2\nJournalist 1\nBallet dancer 1\nCook 1\nNo opinion 36\n* Note: some respondents mentioned more than one job and all preferences were counted,\nhence the total here (270) is greater than the number of respondents.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n15\nThe list is immediately striking in its lack of diversity, particularly when\ncompared to present day aspirations (Francis, 2002). However, closer\nexamination reveals a remarkable consistency in patterns of female job\naspirations over time, with the girls in this 1960s\u2019 cohort most often aspiring\nto the type of jobs still seen as desirable amongst contemporary female\nschool-leavers (Furlong and Biggert, 1999; Francis, 2002). Certainly, the\naspirations expressed by the 1960s school-leavers clearly reflected\ntraditional \u2018feminine\u2019 occupational trends (Rauta and Hunt, 1972; Ashton\nand Maguire, 1980; Furlong, 1986; Bates, 1993). Such positions within the\nlabour market have been traditionally viewed as low skilled and low paid,\njob characteristics which have historically symbolised \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019. In\naccepting jobs such as these women have been seen to hold low initial career\naspirations and this trend has served to \u2018trap\u2019 women at the bottom of the\nlabour market hierarchy (Furlong, 1986). However, we would argue that\nalthough the occupations aspired to by this cohort were generally low skilled\nand low status, they do also suggest that many of the girls were ambitious,\nparticularly given their relatively closed spheres of influence. For example,\nthe range of jobs held by the respondents\u2019 mothers was very narrow, the\nmajority worked in factories and shops or as housewives.\nThe family are frequently the most important influence on an individual\u2019s\njob choice, with mother\u2019s and other female relatives typically having an\ninfluential role in girls\u2019 choice of job. Indeed Furlong (1986:66) found that\nfor the girls in his research, mothers and female friends and relatives were\nthe \u2018single most important influence on occupational aspiration\u2019. He goes on\nto suggest that the use of personal and usually female social networks in the\nquest for finding a job goes some way towards explaining occupational\nsegregation and the tendency for girls to enter traditionally feminine\nemployment. This was partly true amongst this sample, many of whom were\nactively encouraged by their informal contacts, particularly their mothers, to\nfollow in their own occupational footsteps thus also perpetuating the cycle of\nsocial and cultural reproduction which serves to reproduce the workforce\n\u2018from generation to generation\u2019 (Roberts, 1995: 57).  Significantly, however,\nmany of the girls wanted to avoid taking such jobs and what becomes clear\nfrom our data is that initially these school-leavers, in aspiring to very\ndifferent careers than those of their mothers were attempting to resist the\nmechanisms of social and cultural reproduction.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n16\nI\u2019ve been in the factory where mother works, I didn\u2019t like it, it was noisy\nand dusty.\nJust didn\u2019t fancy factory work, saw mother\u2019s factory, old factory, messy.\nInstead of following their mothers\u2019 examples, popular ambitions for the next\ngeneration were to become hairdressers or to work with children, either as\nnursery nurses or teachers, jobs which few of the girls\u2019 mothers were\nemployed in:\nHairdressing.  I liked doing people\u2019s hair. There wasn\u2019t any vacancies,\neverybody wants to go into hairdressing. Also there isn\u2019t enough money\ndoing your apprenticeship.\nI wanted to be a hairdresser in my 2nd year. Then I always wanted to work\nwith children, I don\u2019t know.\nNursery nurse, I like working with children and it was a job where you\ncould work with children.\nAlthough seemingly realistic and modest aspirations were held, few of the\ngirls were able to realise their ambitions. This was, in part, because the\nsocial and economic structures in place proved too strong to resist and the\njobs the girls dreamt of were just not available in the local labour market. As\nBates (1993:21) suggests:\n \u2018\u2026 at the crucial juncture of school leaving, the structures to which they\nhad so far been exposed had not brought their aspirations into line with\nlabour market opportunities\u2026Whilst oriented in the general direction of\ngender-stereotyped, working class jobs, they were still seeking jobs a \u2018cut\u2019\nabove what was possible\u2019.\nIn addition the girls\u2019 own circumstances, particularly their generally low\nlevels of educational achievement, had already conspired to militate against\ntheir ambitions.\nWe now move on to look in more detail at the realities of employment for\nthis group and the extent to which cultural and social reproduction was\nultimately a key characteristic of the Leicester girls\u2019 experiences.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n17\nOccupational Choice and The Reality of Employment\nThe Leicester labour market of the early 1960s was dominated by hosiery,\nknitwear and boot and shoe factories and although employment was widely\navailable, the jobs on offer were initially disdained by many of the girls.\nHowever, once they began to look seriously for work many found that they\nhad less choice than they had first assumed and consequently had to lower\ntheir aspirations in order to enter the labour market. As Roberts (1995) has\nproposed, the notion of occupational choice was something of a myth and\nthe opportunities available in the local labour market largely dictated the\nemployment destinations of most school-leavers.  As such, the majority of\nthis female cohort eventually took the precise jobs they had fought so hard to\navoid; in factories, shops and offices. These were the jobs which the girls\nhad known were available and, importantly, jobs which were easily\nattainable because qualifications were generally not required. Of all the girls\nwho had wanted to become hairdressers only nine managed to achieve jobs\nin salons and only four girls found jobs working with children. By contrast,\nmore than a quarter of the sample began their employment in a factory and\nfor the majority working life turned out to be very similar to that of their\nparents.\nThis group of Leicester girls were certainly not unusual in their lack of\nsuccess in achieving their occupational ambitions. Job aspirations held by\nschool pupils are often not the jobs they are ultimately employed in and the\njobs that children aspire to not the jobs that they really expect to do (Carter,\n1962; Roberts, 1975, 1995; Furlong, 1993; Francis, 2002). As Furlong\n(1993: 60) has argued:\n\u2018By the age of sixteen most young people have some idea of the sorts of\nwork they want to enter once they leave school. However, at this stage their\nideas about future jobs are often tentative and as they make the transition\nfrom school to work they will tend to modify their ideas as certain jobs\nprove difficult to enter and as new opportunities arise\u2019.\nBates (1993) found that amongst the YTS girls she interviewed in the early\n1980s, there was a general aspiration for unrealistic occupations, unrealistic\npartly because of the high unemployment at the time.  These girls mentioned\ntheir desire to work as hairdressers, beauty therapists, to look after children\nor work in department stores. In reality they became care assistants looking\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n18\nafter old people, a much less desirable job, rather like many of the Leicester\ngirls who eventually took jobs in factories. Bates goes on to suggest that in\nprevious decades, when unemployment had not been an issue and the school\nto work transition was seen to be a more linear, simple process, this\n\u2018mismatch\u2019 may have been unusual. However, our data indicates that this\nwas not so and even in the 1960s the career ambitions of many girls were not\nnecessarily achievable.\nSimilarly, Wallace (1986) has questioned the relevance of the notion of\n\u2018functional convergence\u2019 whereby school-leavers in the post-war years, prior\nto high unemployment, did not find their entry into work a \u2018shock\u2019 because\ntheir previous experiences at school and at home had prepared them for this.\nIn contrast, she argues that those who left school during periods of high\nunemployment \u2018\u2026had to accept jobs lower than their expectations due to a\ndecline in opportunities in the local labour market\u2026\u2019 (Wallace, 1986:99).\nOur data, on the other hand, indicates that in fact even at times of high\nemployment and with a buoyant local labour market school-leavers still had\nto lower their pre-employment aspirations once they had begun to test the\nwaters locally.\nGetting a job\nThe Leicester girls seemed to be very well informed about the jobs which\nwere within their frames of reference but distinctly lacking in knowledge\nabout how to realise their comparatively modest ambitions. For example,\nthere seemed to be little idea of the qualifications required for the jobs\noriginally aspired to, one girl explained that she had wanted to work in a\nnursery but \u2018\u2026I changed my mind when I found I had to look after young\nchildren\u2026\u2019.  Other girls had liked the idea of certain jobs but changed their\nminds when they found out more as to what would be required of them:\nNursery nursing. I like children - someone I knew did that job - they told\nme about it and it put me off - I think you needed some GCE subjects -\nanyway what they told me put me off.\nI wanted to be a teacher but saw what they had to do and the 4 years at\nschool.\nAs I say wouldn\u2019t have minded being a teacher but all the training. Couldn\u2019t\nreally face about 3 years at college ...\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n19\nFrancis (2002) suggests that this lack of information about job requirements\nis not unusual and generally school-leavers are often not fully informed as to\nthe level of qualification required for certain jobs and professions. As the\nquotes above highlight, once these girls found out more about the jobs they\nwere interested in, many were disheartened and did not pursue their\nambition further.\nWhilst the school-leavers could have been expected to seek guidance and\nadvice from formal agencies such as school and the Youth Employment\nOffice (YEO) these proved for many to be not a particularly valuable\nresource.  At the time of the Young Workers project the main function of\nYEO and Youth Employment Officers (YEOs), the predecessors of the\ncareers service, was to place individuals in employment and not to offer\nvocational guidance (Ashton and Field, 1976:121). The majority of our\nsample had attended at least one interview with a YEO prior to leaving\nschool. However, many of them were disparaging about their experience of\nthe service, commenting that they had not found the YEO to be helpful to\nthem at all and, like the girls in Griffin\u2019s (1985) later study, they were often\nvery critical, as responses to the question \u2018did the YEO help you to make up\nyour mind about which job to take?\u2019 illustrate:\nNo - she was hopeless.\nI had got job before so went to tell her I had got it.  She was stand offish.\nDidn\u2019t try to help you.\nNo - she tried to push me into an office.\nShe didn\u2019t suggest one because I was so keen on being a receptionist. She\nturned quite nasty.\nI told them I wanted to go to agricultural college and she said she couldn\u2019t\nhelp me at all, I would have to do it off my own bat.\nYes. Sent me for a poor job. Sent me for one that was already taken. I\u2019ve a\nvery poor opinion of them. So have other girls.\nWhat becomes clear from the data is the extent to which the YEOs served to\nreinforce the perception that girls should only apply for certain jobs, usually\n\u2018suitable female jobs\u2019 (Griffin, 1985:31) regardless of the job the school-\nleaver was interested in. It was quite common for them to explain that they\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n20\nfelt the YEO had tried to \u2018persuade them out of a career\u2019 or push them into\nanother.\nWe all found she tried to push you in a factory, she tried to put you off jobs left,\nright and centre. She tried to get most of us in factories, even those who wanted to\ngo to college.\nNo - she wasn\u2019t all that much help - she tried to bully you into that certain job (in\na hosiery factory).\nOh! No! she wanted me to go into a hosiery factory.\nShe said shoes, she tried to get everybody in shoes. She thought shoes were a\ngood job (?)\nShe tried to get me to go to Frears or into the shoes.\nGenerally it appeared that the YEOs did not encourage the school-leavers to\nbroaden their horizons.  As such, the girls who had the least successful\nencounters with their YEOs tended to be those who wanted to follow less\ntraditional paths or had ambitious ideas about the jobs they wanted. The\nfollowing quotes were given in response to the question were \u2018what job did\nthe YEO suggest?\u2019\nKept going on about factory - tried to put me off hairdressing because so\nmany people want to go in it.\nTold her hairdressing and she said no use - plenty of people wanted to get\ninto it.\nFactory, no chance of getting children\u2019s nurse.\nI just like doing people\u2019s hair. I tried to get into it - told the YEO she said I\nwas too small to do it. I wouldn\u2019t be tall enough. Ugh! Boot & Shoes - she\ntried to shove you in any job really. (Respondent\u2019s voice was full of disgust)\nMind you I got my job without her help. She kept suggesting jobs that I\ndidn\u2019t like the sound of. Every time you suggested a job she tried to put you\noff it. First of all I wanted to do hairdressing, then something to do with\ndresses or fashions, she kept trying to put you off in a factory.\nHad to give her 3 jobs - she didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get in (to nursery nursing) so\nshe let me take the exam, she thought I\u2019d be better in a baby shop, but I\ndidn\u2019t want to work in a baby shop.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n21\nThe girls who were more positive about their interviews with the YEO were\nthose who had secured a job through the service.  Whilst during the 1970s\ncareers advisors criticised pupils for expecting their careers interview to be\n\u2018\u2026an automatic route into particular jobs\u2026\u2019(Griffin, 1985:33) some 10\nyears earlier many girls were correct in this assumption and the YEOs did\noffer school-leavers such a route:\nShe gave me quite a few interviews for a shop as an assistant but I was too\nsmall. I went for all these interviews and then it came to the last one and she\nsaid would you like to go into an office and I said I\u2019d try. She helped me get\nthe job.\nI told her what I wanted to do and she helped me find out about jobs and\ngave me three interviews.  I told her I\u2019d got all the jobs - she said I\u2019d have to\nchose the one I liked best.\nTold her what job we\u2019d like to do and she wrote to different factories for us.\nShe just told me names of firms and places and it was like I told her which I\nthought was the best one and she got me an interview.\nClearly the YEOs were operating within local labour markets and, like the\nschool-leavers themselves, they were severely constrained by local\nconditions. As Roberts (1977) has argued, careers officers cannot do\nanything more than advise school-leavers on the realities of actual job\navailability and if they were to encourage the school-leavers to broaden their\nhorizons this would be ultimately unhelpful if the jobs were just not\navailable.  Certainly in Leicester at this time the YEOs appeared to be more\nconcerned with placing young people successfully in employment, advising\nthem to apply for jobs where a vacancy was known to exist and where the\napplicant was likely to be successful, rather than helping them to achieve\ntheir aspirations.\nAshton and Field (1976) suggest that disappointment with the lack of advice\nand guidance offered by the YEO led many young people at the time to\nexpress such dissatisfaction with the service. Those school-leavers who were\nsatisfied with the help offered by the YEO were those who needed to find a\njob. As Keil et al. (1974:87) argue:\n \u2018\u2026for many young people\u2026the Youth Employment Service is seen merely\nas a means of getting a job if one has not already been fixed up.  As part of\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n22\nthe process of adjustment to working life, these formal agencies are\nrelatively ineffective in comparison with informal influences\u2019.\nAmongst most of our sample the practicalities of finding a job had been\nrelatively straightforward. Nearly all found work easily and most had\nalready arranged jobs through informal contacts prior to actually leaving\nschool, thus the services of the YEO in securing a job were often not\nrequired.  Personal networks were extremely important amongst this sample\nand many girls mentioned that their family, most often their mothers or other\nfemale relatives but occasionally fathers and brothers, had helped them to\nfind their first jobs. For others their friends were important sources of\ninformation, telling them of vacancies which had arisen in their workplaces\nas the responses to the question \u2018how did you get to know about your job?\u2019\nindicate:\nMother saw board outside firm advertising vacancies.\nFriend worked there, I wanted to go where I knew somebody so went to see\nif there were any vacancies.\nMother and father work there. Father spoke to lady in charge.\nWell I was introduced to it by a friend. She told me they wanted an office\njunior, she works there. Before I left school I went for interview and got job.\nThe job? My mum used to work there and they said I could have a job if I\nwanted it.\nFamily members and friends often had detailed local knowledge about\ncertain employers and would encourage the girls to apply for work in\nfactories with good reputations amongst employees. Other employers were\nspurned as local information may have suggested that conditions were poor\nand the employees not well treated.  Such information played a key role in\ndetermining the jobs which the girls were interested in and their comments\nwhen asked \u2018why did you take this job\u2019 suggest that it was this information\nwhich was believed and valued more highly than that provided by the formal\nagencies.\nA friend said it was a good firm to work for, so went down to see if I could\nget a job.\nMostly because my mother recommended it.\nI heard it was good pay when I started to train.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n23\nIt was first job offered to me, my uncle worked there. He said a fairly good\nplace to work.\nRates of occupational mobility amongst the group were also quite high and\nmany of the girls were in their second or third jobs. Those who found the job\ntaken to be disappointing in anyway had no qualms about leaving to seek\nbetter conditions, for example, higher rates of pay. Often this movement was\nwell thought out and a change of employer was sought in order to make\nprogress in a chosen career. For example, some girls initially took jobs\nwhich did not match their ultimate career plans whilst waiting for the job\nthey really wanted to become available, typically hairdressing:\nTried to get into hairdressing but couldn\u2019t before leaving school so this\nseemed ok for time being (respondent took a job in a textile factory until she\ncould start training to be a hairdresser)\nTook it (shop assistant position) as a stopgap until able to find job as\nwindow dresser. When at school always wanted to be a hairdresser -\nunfortunately only mother and me and it was only low wages. Then decided\nwanted to be a window dresser but couldn\u2019t get in.\nI wanted to be a hairdresser but could not get an apprenticeship or get into\nthe hair dressing school until January so I took this job (shop assistant).\nMany were prepared to invest in their own futures in other ways, for\nexample using their own time to improve their skills and therefore their\nemployment prospects. Roberts (1984:26) has noted that this was not an\nunusual trend amongst female workers because unlike their male\ncounterparts, they tended not to be offered either on-the-job training or day\nrelease primarily because employers were reluctant to invest in training\nemployees who they believed were likely to \u2018swan off and have children\u2019.\nFor example it was common for the girls in our cohort to be learning typing\nskills in order to improve their prospects.\nIn general then the respondents were remarkably well informed about the\nrange of labour market opportunities available to them. Clearly long-term\ncareer prospects were significant for a large proportion of this group and\nmany had relatively well developed training and development plans for\nthemselves, suggesting employment was not seen as a temporary\narrangement until they married and had children.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n24\nMarriage, motherhood and the future\nWallace (1986:95) and others have argued that traditional models of social\nreproduction have placed women firmly within the family, implying that\nalthough most women seek employment on leaving school this is only\nviewed as a stop gap until marriage and motherhood takes over. Griffin\n(1985:50), for example, found that amongst her respondents there was an\nacceptance that marriage and children were an inevitable part of their lives\nahead and that this would also signal the end of their time in the labour\nmarket until their children were older.   For our group the outlook appeared\nto be very similar. When asked  \u2018what do you think you will be doing in ten\nyears\u2019 time?\u2019 more than half of the girls assumed that they would be married\nand have children.\nHope to be happily married with a little girl, I shall call her Kim.\nI\u2019ll be married and at home. I\u2019m not going to work when I\u2019m married.\nSettled with family - don\u2019t want to have to work.\nMarried with about 50 kids!\nWell a lot of water passes under the bridge but I might be married with\nchildren or married and still at work.\nWhen the boys in the sample were asked the same question far fewer\nmentioned the prospect of marriage, focusing their responses instead on their\nfuture career. As Ashton and Field (1976:106-7) propose, young women did\nnot attach the same significance to their careers as the young men because\nthe women could \u2018\u2026 opt out of the labour market for considerable periods in\norder to raise a family\u2026\u2019. The implied luxury afforded to women as a\nconsequence of such a career break meant that they were less likely than\nmen \u2018\u2026to have as firm a commitment to making a career\u2026\u2019. However, for\nthe Leicester girls, marriage and motherhood, whilst certainly important to\nmany, did not appear to be viewed as the \u2018be all and end all\u2019 of their lives in\nthe same way that other research has found (Pollert, 1981; Griffin, 1985;\nWallace, 1986) and many expected and often hoped to continue working\nafter only taking a short employment break to have children.  Indeed, a\nnumber of the girls had maintained relatively sophisticated career aspirations\nand talked of their hopes to \u2018own my own shop\u2019, \u2018travel around the world\u2019\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n25\nand \u2018become the supervisor\u2019 when asked \u2018what do you think you will be\ndoing in ten years\u2019 time?\u2019:\nDaren\u2019t really think but I hope to own my own salon. I\u2019m going to be\napprenticed and have courses on different aspects of hairdressing.\nDon\u2019t know, hoping I\u2019m going to be a typist in authority, I hope I might take\nmy Father\u2019s firm over later on.\nI hope to be in America (had plans to work as nanny in USA).\nHope to be married and get a shop - me own salon.\nI hope to get secretarial position. Don\u2019t want to get married too early, and\nI\u2019d like to travel before I settle down.\nThere is evidence then to indicate that for some of this sample of girls there\nwas a strong commitment to their careers and they were prepared to invest\nheavily in the future, indicating that not all of them believed that marriage\nand children would signal the end of their working lives.\nConclusion\nThe 1960s were, in some respects, an easier time to be leaving school than\nlater years have proved to be. The job market was buoyant and the girls in\nthe Leicester study were not worried about the prospect of unemployment.\nDespite having few qualifications and overall a low commitment to\neducation the majority had given quite serious consideration to their\nemployment ambitions. Although predominantly oriented towards \u2018female\u2019\njobs, many had thought beyond their immediate frames of reference and\nwere keen to embark upon careers which differed from those of their\nmothers. However, most were unable to seriously pursue the careers they\nwanted because they were restricted by factors such as their own lack of\nqualifications, their limited knowledge of prospects outside their immediate\nlocal area and a lack of the type of opportunity that they sought.  As Roberts\n(1984:26) comments, during this period \u2018\u2026neither the girls nor the wider\nsociety regarded routine\u2026jobs as anything other than sensible stop gaps\nbetween school leaving and motherhood. Women had already been\nemancipated, or so it was believed\u2026\u2019. Contrary to this belief these young\nwomen were given little opportunity to broaden their horizons and the\npursuit of ambitions was not encouraged. At every turn they were pushed\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n26\ntowards low status and low skilled jobs by teachers, youth employment\nofficers and their own families.  Cycles of social and cultural reproduction\nwere very much in evidence in Leicester and as much as the young women\ntried to resist this many found it to be impossible.\nThese girls were, then, faced with a complicated transition to work and\nadulthood, fraught with contradictions. On the one hand they were expected\nto enter employment on leaving school and on the other they had been\nsocialised to believe that their paid work was somehow not so important as\nmen\u2019s.   Both at home and at school social structures have tended to operate\nin such a way that girls have held low occupational aspirations and generally\nhave a lower commitment to school and to their future employment because\nthey accepted that their long term prospects placed them in the home as\nwives and mothers (Wallace, 1986:95). However, in reality the process for\nyoung women is very different to this. Very few of the girls in this study, for\nexample, assumed that marriage and motherhood would permanently\nexclude them from the labour market and few had mothers who did not work\nin paid employment. Although the majority did expect to give up work at\nsome point, nearly all of them also anticipated the resumption of waged\nwork once their children started school. It was common for these Leicester\ngirls to have relatively sophisticated career aspirations which did not reflect\ntheir immediate frames of reference.  Many chose the jobs that offered the\nbest training and therefore future career opportunities over and above the\nemployment which offered immediate financial gratification suggesting that\nthe girls had long term plans to develop their own careers.\nAccess to this previously unanalysed data set provides us with the\nopportunity to re-examine debates from the time that the data was collected,\nin the light of contemporary debates. In particular, the data provides a rich\nresource on the experiences of a previously under\u2013researched group of\nyoung workers, namely young women. In addition the data provides an\nopportunity to carry out longitudinal research on this cohort giving a\ncomplete picture of the match between aspirations and realities over time.\nWe aim to trace and re-interview a sample of the respondents, women who\nnow, some 40 years later, are approaching retirement. Access to such rich\nlongitudinal data is rare and provides a valuable opportunity to reflect upon\nthe eventual work histories of this sample and the possible implications for\ncontemporary debate on the experience of older workers.\nCLMS Working Paper No 36\nCentre for Labour Market Studies\nUniversity of Leicester\n27\nNotes\n[1] This paper is part of an ESRC project \u2018From Young Workers To Older\nWorkers: Reflections on Work in the Life Course\u2019 (R000223653).
