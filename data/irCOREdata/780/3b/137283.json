The present investigation focused on the poor \neconomic and engineering performances of one aspect of the Nigerian petrochemical \nindustry: these disappointing characteristics are usually attributed to inadequate \nmanagement and unstable political circumstances in the country. \n  \nEven up to the late 1960s, there was little financial investment in petrochemical \nproduction in Nigeria. However, since 1976, there have been growing economic and \npolitical pressures to (i) harness the vast indigenous natural-reserves of crude oil and \nnatural gas, as well as (ii) stop natural gas being flared. The development of the \npetrochemical industry in Nigeria has been highly dependent upon expatriate labour and \nknow-how as well as imported equipment. The set-up of the industry is in the form of \njoint ventures: hence problems have arisen from cultural and ethnic differences thereby \nhindering joint decision-making. Thus, self-sufficient, politically astute, technically well-\nqualified Nigerian leaders are urgently needed in the industry. Relevant entrepreneurship \nshould be more quickly recognised and better rewarded at all levels in the industry. When \nsuch personnel are appointed, they should be allowed greater freedom to innovate in all \naspects of the business (i.e. with respect to technological processes, quality control, \nmanagement, financial decision-making and marketing). \n \nTARGETS AND AUDITS \n  \nSpecific detailed goal-oriented activities tend to be more productive. A typical audit of \nthese activities would include the measurement of effectiveness [i.e. the extent to which \nthe objectives of the planned activities are realized and the desired results achieved \n  3 \nquickly, without undue wastefulness of resources (ISO 9000, 2000)], and a subsequent \ncomparison of the outcomes of the process corresponding with the required goals. The \nprocess \u201cowner\u201d, usually, undertakes such an assessment. The evaluation may be \naccomplished using formal, standardized procedures e.g. benchmarking and self-\nassessment (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 2002).  \n  \nWhen what has been achieved is presented in the form of a well-documented standard \nmodel or procedure, the evaluation is referred to as an \u201caudit against criteria\u201d: see ISO \n9000 (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 2002). Every individual at the petrochemical plant \nshould check frequently as to whether or not s\/he is behaving as a conscientious or \ncontentious worker (Tamini et al, 1995) by asking such questions as: Do I achieve what is \nexpected in a professional and acceptable way? Can I make improvements to the design \nor process being employed? What can I learn from the \u2018best-in-class\u2019 competitors in \nnominally similar production plants\/services? Have I given, today, value-for-money to \nthe organisation? If the answer is \u2018negative\u2019 to some such basic questions, then \nimprovements need to be introduced.  \n \nThe primary objective of the self-audit is to evaluate and upgrade ones behaviour, by \ncontinually examining both the performance enablers and achieved results. (Business \nperformance enablers can be grouped into three categories: goals (including strategy, \npolicy and objectives), resources (people, materials, information and infrastructure) and \nprocesses (including leadership and realization of outputs) (Karapetrovic and Willborn, \n2002)). The enablers should be assessed for their suitability and effectiveness to achieve \nset performance-targets. The results, which may include those related to employees, \ncustomers, society, and key financial and non-financial outputs are measured and \ncompared with targets levels (EFQM, 1999). The performance levels should be assessed \nperiodically for their current appropriateness and feasibility. The basic requirements for \ncontinual improvement are: identifying accurately the problem, and motivating yourself \n(and others) to solve it by taking effective actions (Forsha, 1992). Shirley and Gryna, \n(1998), emphasized that, in order to achieve self-control, process owners or controllers \nmust know:  \n\u2022 What their actual performance has been.  \n\u2022 What they are supposed to do: i.e. set of clear aims \n\u2022 How to regulate their performance.  \n  \nImproving productivity usually requires a wiser use of both human and other resources as \nwell as facilities. A performance appraisal or productivity measurement should reveal:-  \n\u2022  What in detail needs to be done if the targets are to be achieved?  \n\u2022 The problems facing both the management and the employees.  \n\u2022 The costs of not solving, as well as solving, the problems being faced.  \n\u2022 The necessary actions required to overcome the problem, and how to relate the \noutput to these actions.  \n \nTo achieve the objectives, the audit must check that the set targets are within the \nframework and remit of the strategic plan, and that the targets are predictable to within \nthe accuracy required. The productivity measurement or performance audit will identify \n  4 \nthe key changes needed in the employed systems, working methods, skills and attitudes. \nIt should highlight the resources, assistance, training and developments required by those \nconcerned in order to overcome each problem.  \n  \nThe audit of a system will help (i) determine the effectiveness of existing operations, (ii) \nhighlight the strengths and weaknesses in the systems and processes, and (iii) devise an \nimplementable plan and controls for the activities to achieve higher productivities. Also, \nit should provide a methodology for improving the operation and maintenance schedules \ncontinually by auditing the main subprocesses, such as maintenance management (Raouf \nand Ben-Daya, 1995, Duffuaa et al, 1999) and thereby reduce running costs. Because a \nself-audit includes the measurement and comparison of what has been achieved with \ndesired levels of performance, it may be represented as a process with a negative-\nfeedback loop (see Figure 1).  \n  \nEach individual should try to identify their strengths, weaknesses, existing opportunities \nas well as present and likely future threats i.e. undertake a SWOT analysis, and then \ncompare his\/her performance with set requirements (e.g. as given in a job description), \nand the standards achieved by the best in the field (i.e. benchmarking)(Karapetrovic and \nWillborn, 2002). While process-quality audits, self-assessments and benchmarking are all \nused to evaluate achieved performances against set criteria (ISO 9000 Standards \nbusiness-excellence models, Malcolm Aldridge National and European Quality Awards, \nand state-of-the-art approaches, respectively), each methodology has its own merits (and \nlimitations). For example, a self-assessment usually outperforms an audit in terms of \nidentifying strengths and opportunities for continual improvement, prevention of crises \narising and the incorporation of assessment results into the rolling strategic and \noperational business plans. \n \nSCOPE.  \n  \nTo accomplish its objectives, an audit has to: \n\u2022 Check how the targets have been set within the framework of the strategic plan.  \n\u2022 Identify (i) key problems and difficulties that should be confronted if the targets \nare not achieved; (ii) notional costs of failing to solve such problems; (iii) key \nchanges needed in presently-employed systems, as well as considering methods, \nskills, and attitudes applied elsewhere in nominally-similar plants to achieve \nimproved performances; (iv) resources, assistance, training\/retraining and system \ndevelopment required by those concerned in order to deal with each problem; and \n(v) the means to tackle the problem through data gathering, their analyses, \nproblem solving, and discussions with concerned personnel.  \n \nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY  \n \nThe quantity of output from the Nigerian petrochemical-industry has been examined, \nanalyzed and found wanting. Data were collected from the Warri and Kaduna \nPetrochemical Companies -see Table 1. The study looked at the utilization of various \n  5 \nresources and categorized them into the major segments: - capital, labour, energy, \nfeedstocks, chemicals, catalysts, materials and utilities.  \n  \n   TABLE 1.

Other, sometimes interrelated, causes included the irregular \nsupplies of feedstocks from the refineries, lack of adequate operating capital, insufficient \nmaintenance budgets, mistakes in the plant\u2019 s original design, limitations imposed by the \ninadequately trained workforce, improper maintenance policies, ageing plants and poor \nmanagement. \n  \nTotal-quality management and lean ( e.g. just-in-time, JIT) management processes have \nbeen proposed, but their implementation in the present cultural set-up will be difficult. \nHence, after the full implementation of 5s house-keeping procedures, benchmarking was \nrecommended. This, to some extent, is now being attempted \n   \nWhole organizations should try to comply with ISO 9000 standards, use quality awards \nand benchmarks, and perform self-audits of their business performances (Karapetrovic \nand Willborn, 2002). Self-assessments are cross-functional, less formal, and always \nintrinsically motivated (Van der Wiele et al, 2001). The audit is still superior with respect \nto the objectivity of the evaluation process, reliability and consistency of results, as well \nas the identification of systematic failures: it provides an unbiased view of the process \nbeing audited.  \n \nBenchmarking facilitates the achievement of a good understanding of superior pertinent-\npractices, helps in fact-based decision-making and clearly identifies weaknesses (Dale, \n1998): it essentially amounts to being guided by somebody else\u2019 s successful processes to \nreach worthwhile targets, but with the potential locally to innovate (Besterfield et al, \n1999). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6 \n                                                        \n \n                                      \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            ORGANIZATIONAL SELF-AUDIT.  \n                                      \n                                       \n                                       \n \n \n \n \n                                                             \n \nFigure.1 Self-audit procedure (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 2002) \n \nProductivity \n \nThis is generally expressed as a ratio of an output to the corresponding input with a \ntypical production model shown in Figure 2.

The considered parameters in this instance are unit price, quality, and flexibility of \noperation and delivery dependability.  \n \nProductivity Index. It is desirable to compare current results against the performance for \na year that does not show an abnormally high or low value of productivity - see Table 4. \nIt is apparent that during times of rapid inflation, comparing results for one period against \nthose for a different period could lead to misleading values of the productivity index. The \nphysical resources used may not increase, but their costs almost certainly will, thereby \nincreasing the inputs and showing an apparent fall in productivity.  \n \nWith this proviso being taken into account, the challenges of the productivity indices \nindicate trends with respect to how well resources are being utilized locally and act as \nsignals for appropriate actions to be taken. They encourage one to \u201c think harder rather \nthan necessarily work harder\u201d .  \n \nVALIDITY OF THE MODEL  \n  \nFor the present investigation, 1997 was used as the reference year (i.e. base year period, \nBP). Polypropylene, PP, as intimated by Tables 2-4, was used as the considered product. \nThe following were identified as the relevant input and output data:  \n(i) Input and output quantities produced during the period under consideration \n(Current Period ,CP). \n(ii) Input and output quantities during the BP and CP  \n(iii) Mean unit selling prices during the BP and CP respectively  \n(iv) Individual input costs and output sales during the BP \n(v) Costs of individual inputs and output sales during the BP  \n  \nData (see Tables 3-5) were collected for the Warri petrochemical plants. Unfortunately, \ntoo often, accurate pertinent records were either missing or not recorded correctly. The \ncollected data are for the five-year period, i.e. 1997 to 2001 inclusive. All the inputs and \noutputs were translated into costs in US$. However, inflation was not taken into account, \nso each of the presented figures are the real cost for the stated year.  \n \n \nTABLE 2.

Thus four \ntypical values of the performance factor namely 95%, 85%, 75%, and 48.2%, have been \nconsidered in this analysis, though with the exception of 95%, these values are below the \naverage worldwide performance index for polypropylene production. \n \nUsing equation (1), the data of Table 7 have been deduced. \n \nTABLE 7: Estimated annual gross-income versus plant-performance factor  \n \nPerformance \nFactor \n% \nGross output \n(106t) \nSales \n$150\/t \n$ \nProduction Cost \n$ 136\/t \n$ \nIncome \n \n$ \n95 32,281.065 492,159.95 45,382.06   44,753.73 \n85 29,749.880 446,224.80 405,942.08   40,306.12 \n75 26,249.888 393,748.20 357,943.36 35,804.84 \n48.2 16,869.928 253,049.85 230,038.37   23,011.49 \n \nAnnual imported supplement = 23, 9800 metric tonnes.  \nat production cost of $136.36\/t = $32562768 \nat selling price of $150\/t = $ 35820000  \nCost in foreign exchange = $ 3257232 \n \nDISCUSSION  \n   \nThe results show that the input resources were ineffectively utilized. The installed \ncapacity designed to be 35,000 metric tones\/year of polypropylene, has never been \nreached, while the costs of capital, labour, interest on W.C, energy, and utilities have \nincreased.  Significant economics of scale and lower fuel costs per tonne of \npolypropylene produced should be achieved in Nigeria. \n   \nNigeria\u2019 s average performance factor during the period 1997 to 2001 was 48.2% whereas \nthe worldwide average was 98%. This was partly due to insufficient feedstock being \navailable and the low availability of functioning plant and equipment. The economic \nimpact of a reduced indigenous performance resulted in the shortfall in polypropylene \nproduction to supply Nigeria\u2019 s demand.  \n \nCONCLUSION.  \n  \nThere are many reasons for the poor performance of the Nigerian petrochemical-industry. \nEach manager, as well as the government, to a greater or lesser extent, bears some \nresponsibility for it and this attitude should be integrated into each organisations. The \nindustry needs more focus on (i) developing the skills of its workers, (ii) employing \n  10 \nhigher-quality processes, (iii) achieving customer satisfaction and faster delivery, and (iv) \nappointing more entrepreneurial leaders.  \n  \nInappropriate government regulations, unwise employment contracts, lack of continual-\nimprovement programmes (e.g. see Figure 4) have all led to poor performances. There is \na need for benchmarking of performance against the \u2018best-in-class\u2019  worldwide. Sources \nof competitive benchmarking information include customers, visits to other companies, \ntrade shows and journals, professional societies, standard committees, product brochures, \noutside consultants, and installation data.   \n \n \n \n \n Figure 4.
