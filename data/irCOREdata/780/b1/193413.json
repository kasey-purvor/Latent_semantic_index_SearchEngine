The potential contribution of EPRVs to plant pathogenicity or, conversely, to virus resistance is just beginning to be explored. Some members of the family Solanaceae are particularly rich in EPRVs. In previous work, EPRVs have been characterized molecularly in various species of Nicotiana including N.tabacum (tobacco) and Solanum tuberosum (potato). Here we describe a family of EPRVs in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and a wild relative (S.habrochaites).\\ud\nResults:\\ud\n\\ud\nMolecular cloning and DNA sequence analysis revealed that tomato EPRVs (named LycEPRVs) are most closely related to those in tobacco. The sequence similarity of LycEPRVs in S.lycopersicum and S.habrochaites indicates they are potentially derived from the same pararetrovirus. DNA blot analysis revealed a similar genomic organization in the two species, but also some independent excision or insertion events after species separation, or flanking sequence divergence. LycEPRVs share with the tobacco elements a disrupted genomic structure and frequent association with retrotransposons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that copies of LycEPRV are dispersed on all chromosomes in predominantly heterochromatic regions. Methylation of LycEPRVs was detected in CHG and asymmetric CHH nucleotide groups.

Nevertheless, in\nrecent years there have been accumulating reports of\nendogenous pararetroviral sequences (EPRVs) in the\nnuclear genomes of several plants including tobacco\n(Nicotiana tabacum) and other Nicotiana species [1-3],\npotato [4], banana [5-7], petunia [8] and rice [9]. EPRVs\nare assumed to integrate by illegitimate recombination\ninto the host genome, where they may accumulate to high\ncopy numbers [1,10]. Although EPRVs are being detected\nin an increasing number of plant species, the detailed\nstructure of individual EPRV integrants and flanking\nregions has been analysed only in a few families\n[1,3,6,8,9].\nThe role of EPRVs in plant-virus interactions is not yet\nfully understood. Current information suggests that\nEPRVs are not always neutral components of plant\ngenomes but can potentially contribute to either patho-\ngenicity or virus resistance in the host. Indeed, integrated\nsequences of Banana streak virus (BSV), Tobacco vein clear-\ning virus (TVCV) and Petunia vein clearing virus (PVCV)\n[2,5,6,8] can be reactivated in response to abiotic or\ngenomic stress. Episomal copies are probably formed by\ntranscription from tandemly arranged integrants or\nrecombination from fragmented integrants [6,8], which\nleads to the assembly of virus particles and symptoms of\nvirus infection. Interspecific crosses and in vitro propaga-\ntion can induce EPRV reactivation, which has been shown\nto be economically detrimental in banana breeding\n[2,6,11-13].\nUnder different conditions or in other genome constitu-\ntions, EPRVs remain silent and might even have beneficial\neffects for their hosts by providing virus resistance via\nhomology-dependent transcriptional or posttranscrip-\ntional gene silencing [1,14]. Consistent with this pro-\nposal, EPRV-derived enhancer-promotor sequences\nintegrated as transgenes into tobacco chromosomes\nbecame silenced and methylated in the presence of\nhomologous EPRVs [15]. Homology-dependent silencing\ncan be induced by several interrelated pathways [16] that\ninvolve aberrant or double stranded RNA that is processed\nto short RNAs by RNaseIII-like enzymes (Dicer). Post-\ntranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which is the plant\nequivalent of RNAi, is able to counteract RNA and DNA\nviruses at the mRNA level [17,18]. In addition, RNA-\nmediated epigenetic modifications, such as RNA-directed\nDNA or histone methylation [19], could transcriptionally\nrepress DNA viruses at the chromatin level. Further eluci-\ndation of host control over EPRVs will not only facilitate\nassessment and the prevention of EPRV reactivation but\nmay also suggest strategies for genetically engineering\npathogen resistance in agriculturally important plants.\nStudies so far indicate that EPRVs are abundant in some\nmembers of the family Solanaceae, an economically\nimportant taxon that includes tobacco, petunia, potato,\n(bell) pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato. In addition\nto its role as an important food crop, cultivated tomato,\nS.lycopersicum subsection lycopersicon, represents a model\nplant within this family with a small diploid genome that\nlacks large duplications (2n = 24, size 953 Mb; [20]), with\na high-density genetic map [21], and large mutant collec-\ntion http:\/\/tgrc.ucdavis.edu. Recently, it has been chosen\nfor sequencing by an international consortium [22].\nRepetitive sequences comprise wide blocks of pericentro-\nmeric heterochromatin in the tomato genome [23,24]\nthat nevertheless also harbour a considerable share of\ngenic sequences [25,26]. In an S.lycopersicum (Heinz\n1706) BAC library [24], 194 of the 1205 sequenced-\ntagged connectors (STCs) were similar to retrotrans-\nposons and four were similar to tobacco EPRVs, although\nthese sequences were not characterized further.\nTo increase our understanding of endogenous pararetrovi-\nral sequences in economically relevant, genetically tracta-\nble crops, we have characterized a family of EPRVs in\nS.lycopersicum and a wild relative, S.habrochaites which is\nexploited in crosses with S.lycopersicum to introgress\nfavourable traits [27,28] with respect to sequence and\nstructure of a number of integrated copies, as well as to\nchromosomal localization. In addition, we have analysed\nthe methylation status of the EPRV integrants and their\ntranscriptional activity in S.lycopersicum, S.habrochaites\nand interspecific hybrids to investigate the nature of host\ncontrol of these sequences.\nResults\nLycEPRV identification, isolation and sequence analysis\nTomato EPRVs were originally detected by DNA blot anal-\nysis using a 5.5 kb DNA fragment of NsEPRV (Nicotiana\nsylvestris EPRV), one of three EPRV families in tobacco\n[1,2], to probe DNA prepared from various species of Sola-\nnum. The resulting banding pattern was complex, with\nnumerous strong and weak bands superimposed on a\nbackground smear (Fig.1). This pattern is reminiscent of\nthat observed with Nicotiana species [1] and suggests a dis-\npersed organization of multiple copies of a related EPRV\nfamily. Judging from the hybridization intensity, the rela-\ntive copy number of the elements detected by the NsEPRV\nprobe was similar in all five Solanum species tested. The\nbanding pattern in S.lycopersicum strongly resembled that\nin S.cheesmaniae and S.pimpinellifolium, whereas notable\ndifferences were observed in S.habrochaites and S.peruvi-\nanum (Fig.1).Page 2 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:24 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/7\/24To analyze the tomato EPRV sequences in more detail, a\ngenomic \u03bb-library was constructed from cultivated tomato\n(S.lycopersicum \"MicroTom\"; [29]) and the wild relative\nS.habrochaites. Both \u03bb-libraries were screened with the 5.5\nkb fragment of NsEPRV. Five positive clones were isolated\nand partly sequenced for S.lycopersicum and nine for S.hab-\nrochaites. Each clone contained EPRV-like DNA and flank-\ning plant genomic sequences (Fig.2A, Table 1).\nEPRV-like sequences from both species were AT-rich\n(65.4\u201378.4%) and were most similar to EPRVs in Nico-\ntiana, revealing up to 83% sequence identity to endog-\nenous Tobacco vein clearing virus (TVCV; [2]), NsEPRV [1],\nand NtoEPRV (N. tomentosiformis EPRV; the second EPRV\nfamily in tobacco; [3]). Similar to the Nicotiana EPRVs,\nfour open reading frames (ORFs) were identified (Fig.2A):\ncoat protein (CP), cell-to-cell movement protein (MP),\npolyprotein (POL) and transactivator protein (TAV). The\nPOL domain revealed 80 to 90% identical nucleotides,\ncompared to MP (75 to 91%) and TAV (63 to 95%). Only\none clone contained a full CP sequence that showed 65 to\n94% sequence identity to fragments of CP sequences from\nother clones. The identity between DNA sequences\nderived from the same species (S.lycopersicum or S.habro-\nchaites) was generally not higher than between species.\nThus, in the subset of clones analyzed, no species-specific\nclusters of identity were identified and sequences within\none species are as divergent as between species. We there-\nfore assigned these sequences to a single family termed\nLycEPRV (Lycopersicon endogenous pararetrovirus).\nThe putative amino acid sequence identities of the coding\nregions ranged from 60 to 87% identity for MP, 72 to 89%\nfor POL and 48 to 91% for TAV (CP shares 39 to 85%\nidentity to various fragments). However, all of the cloned\nprotein-coding regions are either truncated or harbour\nseveral frameshifts and stop codons and can therefore be\nconsidered translationally defective, a feature also found\nwith Nicotiana EPRVs. Nine of the clones contained parts\nof the putative non-coding intergenic region (IGR) of the\nvirus. The IGR was less conserved compared to the ORFs\nexcept for a 272 to 282 bp box (Fig.2B) which revealed up\nto 86 to 92% sequence identity on the nucleotide level.\nThe conserved 272 to 282 bp box has an overall identity\nof up to 70% with its counterpart in S.tuberosum, SoTu [4]\nand 80% to the IGR of Nicotiana EPRVs with several\nhighly conserved motives. Some IGR sequences contained\nshort (27 to 104 bp) AT-rich structures of low complexity\n(Lh2, Lh5, Le4, Le5) while others revealed short (12 to 24\nbp) direct repeats which were not conserved between the\ndifferent IGRs (Lh2, Lh5, Lh7, Le5). Some clones (Lh7,\nLh2, Lh3) contain a conserved 12 bp motif complemen-\ntary to the 3'end of the tRNAMet (5'-TGGTATCAGAT\/GC-\n3') 50 to 60 bp upstream of this box as well as a putative\npolyadenylation signal (5'-AATAAA-3') and a putative\nTATA box (5'-TATAAA-3') at a distance of 130 to 140 bp\nand 150 to 160 bp upstream, respectively.\nAll of the cloned LycEPRV sequences were truncated and\nflanked either by plant DNA unrelated to EPRVs or by\nrearranged (fragmented, inverted or otherwise partly\nGenomic organization of EPRV sequences in the genus Sola-num subsectio  LycopersiconFigure 1\nGenomic organization of EPRV sequences in the \ngenus Solanum subsection Lycopersicon.

Nearly all LycEPRV junctions\nanalysed adjoin transposable elements, most frequently\nretrotransposon LTRs or related sequences (see Table 1\nand Fig.2A). Clones from S.habrochaites revealed homolo-\ngies to members of the PCRT1 family, a Ty3-gypsy (Meta-\nviridae) element that is dispersed throughout the\npericentric heterochromatin of S.lycopersicum (AY850394;\n[30]). The LTRs of PCRT1 partly correspond to the repeti-\ntive families TGRII and U30, the latter of which comprises\nmore than 4000 copies in the S.lycopersicum genome\n[30,31]. The junctions between EPRV and PCRT1\nsequences were verified for three clones by PCR amplifica-\ntion from genomic DNA (Lh2, Lh4 and Lh7, data not\nshown), confirming that the LycEPRV sequences are\nindeed physically joined to plant DNA while these\nsequences could not be amplyfied in S.lycopersicum.\nWe reconstructed a general structure from the alignments\nof several incomplete sequences (upper bar in Fig.2A).\nThe coding region closely resembles that of the tobacco\nelements (NsEPRV, NtoEPRV) in size with 1779 bp for CP,\n1293 bp for MP, 1933 bp for POL which overlaps with\nTAV (1279 bp) forming a coding region of 6221 bp. The\nintergenic region varies between 1606 to 1680 bp for dif-\nferent clones, summing up to a total length of approx.\n7900 bp (7827 to 7901 bp) for a putative full copy of Lyc-\nEPRV. The 140 kb sequence of a BAC clone (AC171732)\nthat was submitted only recently (November 2006, note\nadded in revision) revealed a single LycEPRV copy. A sin-\ngle stretch of 6125 bp of this sequence corresponds to the\nputative LycEPRV coding region and reveals the same\norder of the four ORFs as reconstructed from the \u03bb-clones.\nThe coding region is flanked by altogether 1542 bp\nhomologous to the IGR on both sides and reveals only\none internal stop codon. The nucleotide sequence of this\ncopy contains 84\u201396% identical nucleotides compared\nwith the \u03bb-clones and 76\u201392% homology to TVCV.\nApproximately 2.7 kb upstream of this LycEPRV copy\nsequences homologous to the LTR of PCRT1a could be\nidentified.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\nTo analyze the chromosomal distribution of LycEPRVs, we\nperformed FISH on root tip metaphase chromosomes and\npollen mother cells at meiotic prophase of S.lycopersicum\nand S.habrochaites. By mixing several probes covering\nmost of the LycEPRV (LycEPRV-Sl; Table 2), we were able\nto observe several weak LycEPRV-Sl hybridization sites\nwith signal strength of several magnitudes lower than that\nobserved with the control 45S rDNA probe. Sites were vis-\nible in varying number near the centromeres of most S.lyc-\nopersicum chromosomes (Fig.3A, B): there were four to six\nchromosomes with a stronger signal, four chromosomes\nshowing very weak signals (arrows) and no signal in thePage 5 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:24 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/7\/24NOR region. Similar results were obtained with extended\npachytene chromosomes demonstrating that the EPRV\nsignals were located mainly in the DAPI positive pericen-\ntromeric heterochromatin or intercalary chromocentres\n(Fig.3D, E arrowheads), but rarly in the euchromatin. The\nweak, but in cases distinct signals of varying size and\narrangements indicate that probably only few copies of\nLycEPRV-Sl are integrated in each cluster, that they might\nnot contain all parts of the probe used or that sequences\nare only partly conserved. The FISH data (Fig.3A\u2013C) sup-\nport the results from Southern hybridization (Fig.1) and\ncloning as well as sequencing data derived from \u03bb-clones\n(Fig.2) and the BAC clone AC171732 indicating that Lyc-\nEPRV-Sl are probably not arranged in perfect tandem\narrays, are truncated and frequently degenerated.\nFISH of LycEPRV-Sl in combination with the retroelement\nsequence U30 on metaphases (Fig.3C) and pachytene\nchromosomes (see Additional file 1) showed signal from\nboth sequences near the centromeres. The signal of the\nU30 probe covered a larger area of the centromeric hetero-\nchromatin while the LycEPRV-Sl hybridization signal\nappeared to be nested within the U30 hybridizing regions.\nThe U30 signal, as the LycEPRV-Sl signal, was absent from\nthe NOR regions (Fig.3C) as has been previously reported\n[32]. FISH of LycEPRV-Sh (Table 2) on metaphase chro-\nmosomes of S.habrochaites showed similar, but not identi-\ncal hybridization patterns to LycEPRV-Sl on S.lycopersicum\nin the pericentromeric region of most chromosomes\n(Fig.3G\u2013I). However, the signal strength seemed to be\nmore variable between chromosomes (Fig.3I); again,\nthere was no hybridization detected to the NOR region\n(Fig.3G).\nDNA methylation analysis\nCytosine methylation of LycERPVs in S.lycopersicum and\nS.habrochaites was investigated using methylation-sensi-\ntive restriction enzymes and DNA blot analysis. Previous\nwork on EPRVs in Nicotiana has shown that the isoschi-\nzomer pair HpaII\/MspI (recognition sequence CCGG),\nwhich is normally used to study CG methylation in ani-\nmals, is not informative because of frequent CHG methyl-\nation in plants, that inhibits both HpaII and MspI, in these\nChromosomal localization of LycEPRVsFigure 3\nChromosomal localization of LycEPRVs.

We therefore focused on enzymes sensi-\ntive to CHG and CHH methylation: ScrFI-BstNI (CmC-\nNGG or CCWGG, respectively) reports on CHG\nmethylation while Sau3AI-NdeI (GATmC) reports on\nmethylation in potentially non-symmetrical cytosines,\ndepending on the sequence context. The first enzyme in\neach isoschizomer pair is methylation-sensitive. Follow-\ning a predigestion with XbaI, an additional digest was per-\nformed with either the methylation-sensitive or -\ninsensitive enzyme from a particular isochizomer pair.\nSouthern blots of electrophoretically separated DNA were\nhybridized to two different probes each (Fig.4). One was\nthe 1.3 kb fragment (probe E1) of the CP\/MP reading\nframe of a cloned S.lycopersicum EPRV copy (Le1), the\nother one was derived from a S.habrochaites clone (Lh7)\nand comprises 580 bp of the IGR including most of the\n273 bp box (probe H7).\nFor both species, the methylation-sensitive ScrFI cleaved\nlittle beyond the XbaI predigest whereas methylation-\ninsensitive BstNI digested substantially more, indicating\nthe presence of CHG methylation of LycEPRV sequences\n(Fig. 4A, B). Little difference between coding regions and\nIGRs was observed. Hybridization of both the Sau3AI-and\nNdeI digested DNA with the CP\/MP probe (E1) revealed\nsubstantial cleavage compared to the XbaI predigestion,\nsuggesting little asymmetrical CHH methylation within\nthe coding EPRV sequences (Fig.4C). Reprobing of the\nsame blot with the IGR probe (H7) revealed a similar pat-\ntern, although smaller bands in the NdeI digests were\nmore emphasized (Fig.4D). This suggests that asymmetri-\ncal methylation of the intergenic region is low but slightly\nstronger than in coding regions. The sequence of the\ncloned LycEPRV sequences did not reveal striking differ-\nences in the relative number of CHG and CHH residues\nbetween IGR and coding regions.\nExpression analysis\nEven though the LycEPRVs sequenced are defective and\nunable to encode intact viral proteins, one or more full-\nlength copies could exist and potentially be pathogenic if\nactivated under stress conditions. To test this possibility,\nwe made inter-specific crosses with the aim of provoking\na genome stress and then examined the hybrids for symp-\ntoms of virus infection. Four different interspecific crosses\nwere made between different wild species (S.pimpinellifo-\nlium, S.habrochaites, S.cheesmaniae and, S.peruvianum) and\nS.lycopersicum (\"MicroTom\"). The phenotype of 7\u201327\nindividuals per cross resembled the phenotype of the wild\nparent rather than the dwarf cultivar of S.lycopersicum\n(\"MicroTom\"). Their hybrid nature was confirmed by SSR\nmarker analysis (LE 20592; [33]) to exclude selfed off-\nspring.\nNo typical symptoms of virus-induced diseases could be\ndetected at any time during the development of the\nhybrids that were grown in a greenhouse for a full year\nand trimmed frequently. In addition, hybridization of\nundigested, genomic DNA of selected individuals to\nprobe E1 and H7 (coding region and IGR, respectively)\nfailed to demonstrate episomal virus DNA since all indi-\nviduals lacked the expected three bands for the linear, cir-\ncular or supercoiled episomal DNA species (Fig.4, first\nlane each).\nThe cytosine methylation of the interspecific hybrids was\nanalysed in comparison to parental genomes of each\ncross. In all cases the methylation pattern of the hybrid\nindividuals resembled that of their parents: CHG and\nCHH methylation in the LycEPRV coding regions as well\nas in the IGRs could be observed (Fig.4). The unchanged\nmethylation pattern and the absence of any virus-induced\ndisease symptoms in the interspecific hybrids suggest that\nactive virus was not produced by endogenous virus\nsequences under the conditions tested.\nInterestingly, despite the inability to induce active virus in\nhybrids and the presence of cytosine methylation Lyc-\nEPRVs appeared to be transcribed to some extent in\nhealthy plants. The NCBI EST sequence databases contain\ntranscripts from S.lycopersicum, S.habrochaites and S.pen-\nnellii with high similarity to our sequenced LycEPRVs from\nS.lycopersicum and S.habrochaites. More than 30 EST\nhomologies were distributed over all four EPRV ORFs and\nthe intergenic region. The cDNAs were derived from dif-\nferent tissues including flowers, red or green fruits, seeds,\ntrichomes and shoot meristems as well as from suspen-\nsion culture, callus tissue or crown galls (Fig.5A, Table 3).\nThis suggests widespread transcription of sequences\nclosely related to LycEPRVs in healthy tomato plants and\nrelated wild Solanum species not only under stress but also\nunder normal growing conditions.\nTo further study the transcriptional activity of LycEPRVs in\nS.lycopersicum, S.habrochaites and an inter-specific hybrid,\nRT-PCR was performed using the conserved primer pairs\nCP\/MP and TAV1\/TAV2 amplifying parts of the coding\nregion and IGR1\/IGR2 for the conserved box within the\nintergenic region (Fig.5A, B). Fragments of the expected\nsize were amplified in all individuals (Fig.5B) and DNA\nsequence analysis revealed high sequence similarities to\nthe respective LycEPRV regions. Twenty-one cDNA\nsequences and six genomic sequences of the TAV region\ncomprising 761 to 806 bp each were aligned. Many turned\nout to be identical or nearly identical (> 98% sequence\nidentity) on the nucleotide level whereas others diverged\nup to 30 to 37% (63 to 70% identity, Fig.5C).

Nevertheless the transcripts are generally\nderived from more than one copy in each genome since\ndiverging sequences are falling into at least five different\nclusters in S.lycopersicum, into four in S.habrochaites and\nsix in the hybrid. None of the cloned genomic fragments\nof the corresponding region was matched with 100%\nsequence identity (97 to 99%). Many (62%) of the cDNA\nsequences are translationally defective, i.e. contain\nframeshifts and stop codons in their putative amino acid\nsequence. Similarly nine cDNA sequences and one\ngenomic fragment of the IGR were analysed, which\nrevealed higher homogeneity, but still fall into more than\none cluster (Fig.5D).\nShort RNA analysis\nGiven the absence of viral disease symptoms in plants\nconstitutively expressing LycEPRV transcripts, we tested\nwhether homologous short RNAs \u2013 which might be indic-\native of RNA-mediated silencing \u2013 were present in healthy\nplants. Northern blots containing short RNA fractions\nfrom leaf material of S.lycopersicum, S.habrochaites and an\ninterspecies hybrid as well as flowers of S.lycopersicum\nwere hybridized to RNA probes derived from the LycEPRV\nintergenic region and the TAV region, respectively. For the\nIGR probe a cDNA sequence homologous to the con-\nserved 272 bp box served as a template. A mix of three dif-\nferent clones was chosen for TAV since this region is more\nheterogeneous. Signals could be detected in the two\nparental species and the hybrid with both probes and in\nboth sense and antisense orientations. A distinct band of\n~21 nucleotides in length and several bands ranging from\n22\u201325 nucleotides in length were detected in all samples\nanalysed. Generally, the flower-derived fraction produced\nthe strongest signals (Fig.6).\nTo assess whether the short RNAs were derived from an\nRNAi\/Post-Translational Gene Silencing (PTGS) pathway,\nand hence might contribute to viral defense, we analyzed\nshort RNAs in plants infected with heterologous RNA\nviruses, exploiting their ability to counteract RNA silenc-\ning by encoded proteins that suppress PTGS [17,34,35].\nPotato virus Y (PVY, Potyvirus) expresses HCPro, which is\nknown to prevent the maintenance of RNA silencing and\nbinds to siRNAs preventing the formation of the siRNA-\ninitiated RISC assembly [39,40]. Tomato bushy stunt virus\n(TBSV, Tombusvirus) encodes p19, which forms\nhomodimers and prevents the strand separation of 20\u201322\nnt siRNA duplexes. This is a prerequisite for their integra-\ntion into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC;\n[[36,37], rev. in [38]]. Plants infected with either PVY or\nTBSV revealed increased amounts of the 21\u201322nt LycEPRV\nshort RNA fraction compared to mock infected individu-\nals and plants harvested before starting the infection pro-\ncedure (Fig.7). The accumulation of the smaller sized\nshort RNAs homologous to both the intergenic region of\nLycEPRVs (IGR) and part of the coding region (TAV) could\nbe observed in the cultivars \"MicroTom\" as well as in\n\"Moneymaker\". The phenomenon is consistent with a for-\nmation of the LycEPRV short RNAs in the RNAi\/PTGS\npathway.\nAnalysis of short RNAs homologous to LycEPRVFigure 6\nAnalysis of short RNAs homologous to LycEPRV.

Sequence homologies in cloned frag-\nments of genomic LycEPRV from both species lead us to\nconclude that they are probably derived from the same\npararetrovirus. A corresponding exogenous counterpart of\nLycEPRV has not yet been detected, probably because the\nvirus has not been found yet, is extinct, or has not been\nidentified as the virus sequence could be diverged due to\nfaster evolution of an episomal form. Hence we could also\npostulate TVCV as a possible origin. As shown by the DNA\nblot hybridization patterns (Fig.1), S.lycopersicum and\nS.habrochaites share similarities in LycEPRV sequence\norganization, but each species also has unique restriction\nfragments, indicating independent insertions or excisions\nafter species separation or flanking sequence divergence.\nJunctions that could be amplified by PCR from S.habro-\nchaites but not from S.lycopersicum support such species-\nspecific insertions. The other two wild relatives tested,\nS.cheesmaniae and S.pimpinellifolium, have hybridization\npatterns strongly resembling the pattern found in S.lycop-\nersicum, indicating they harbor the same organisation of\nLycEPRVs, although this has not been confirmed by\nsequence analysis. Another wild relative, S.peruvianum\nalso has sequences related to LycEPRVs, but with hybridi-\nzation patterns distinct from the other species investi-\ngated. The patterns of EPRV hybridization bands reflect\nthe morphology-based taxonomy with S.lycopersicum,\nS.pimpinellifolium and S.cheesmaniae most closely related\nand S.habrochaites and S.peruvianum as more distant rela-\ntives [41]. Our results demonstrate that LycEPRVs and\nrelated sequences are common in many species of Sola-\nnum subsection lycopersicon. Given that tomato and\npotato are in the same genus, LycEPRVs are more similar\nto known EPRVs from Nicotiana than to the SoTu EPRV\nfamily [4] from potato.\nAll LycEPRV clones differed in sequence and revealed\njunctions between LycEPRV sequences and non-viral plant\ngenomic sequences, indicating that the cloned sequences\nare indeed derived from endogenous EPRV copies in the\nnuclear genome, rather than from extra-genomic viral\nDNA. Alignment of the 14 clones of different nuclear\nEPRV fragments with overlapping homologous domains\nallowed reconstruction of a hypothetical full length Lyc-\nEPRV sequence (Fig.2A) that contains all the components\nof a typical pararetrovirus with a structure intermediate to\nthat of Caulimoviruses and Badnaviruses [10,42]. The cod-\ning region includes four ORFs and resembles the structure\nof TVCV (Tobacco vein clearing virus) and CsVMV (Cassava\nvein mosaic virus), two members of Cavemoviruses, but dif-\nfers from Caulimoviruses with six ORFs [2,43]. This struc-\nture was confirmed in a complete coding region\nShort LycEPRV RNAs after heterologous virus infectionFigure 7\nShort LycEPRV RNAs after heterologous virus infec-\ntion. The short RNA fraction of S.lycopersicum leaves derived \nfrom the cultivar \"Moneymaker\" (MM), a transgenic line of \n\"Moneymaker\" (CS3, [63]) and the cultivar \"MicroTom\" (MT) \nwas hybridized to TAV (B, D) and IGR (A, C) riboprobes \nafter infecting the plants with PVY (Potyvirus Y; in A, B) or \nTBSV (Tomato bushy stunt virus; in C, D) that express sup-\npressors of PTGS.

EPRVs from\ntomato, potato and tobacco share structural features\nincluding putative signals for transcription initiation and\ntermination, and significant sequence homology, of both\nDNA and hypothetical proteins in the ORFs. By contrast,\nanother endogenous pararetrovirus sequence, ePVCV\nfrom Petunia (also Solanaceae), differs in sequence and\ngenomic structure [8,44].\nSequences complementary to tRNAMet as a priming site for\nthe minus-DNA strand synthesis in the intergenic region\n(IGR) were detected in at least a subset of copies and\ncould be expected, since the replication of pararetrovi-\nruses is driven by transcription via RNA polymerase II and\nreverse transcription. Parts of the IGR with high conserva-\ntion are notable, such as the 272 to 282 bp box (Fig.2B)\nfound in all published EPRVs from tobacco, tomato and\npotato. Though lacking the direct repeats reported for\nNsEPRV [1], the 272 to 282 bp conserved box of LycEPRV\nmakes up part of the B1 box that has proved functionality\nas a promoter-enhancer element for NsEPRV driving GUS\nexpression in apical meristems of A. thaliana [15] which\nsuggests a function, possibly as a regulatory element.\nIndividual LycEPRV sequences showed substantial diver-\ngence (e.g. with as little as 75% homology in the second\nORF and less conservation in the intergenic region) but no\nsequence motifs specific to either S.lycopersicum or S.hab-\nrochaites were evident in the clones examined. Consistent\nwith the related but distinct hybridization patterns on\nDNA blots, LycEPRV sequences in S.lycopersicum and\nS.habrochaites have a similar, although not identical, dis-\npersed chromosomal distribution with sites scattered in\npericentromeric and some intercalary heterochromatic\nregions, while being largely excluded from euchromatin\nand the NOR region (Fig.3). Individual chromosomes of\nboth species showed characteristic stronger or weaker\nhybridization indicating that sequence amplification or\ndegeneration has occurred at specific integration sites.\nAll EPRV containing \u03bb-clones revealed sequence trunca-\ntions and rearrangements when compared to the TVCV-\nlike consensus structure (Fig.2A). Inverted, duplicated and\ntruncated EPRV fragments adjacent to plant genomic DNA\nwithout viral homology have been reported for NsEPRV in\ntobacco [1], rice EPRVs [9] and endogenous Banana streak\nvirus (BSOEV) copies in banana [6]. Homologous recom-\nbination between new viral integrants, pre-existing EPRVs\nand perhaps retroelements could be responsible for the\nvariable and complex genomic structures [7,10].\nHalf of the LycEPRV elements isolated are flanked on one\nor both sides by retrotransposon sequences (Table 1).\nSome 60% are represented by LTR sequences characteris-\ntic of the Metaviridae (Ty3-gypsy-like) elements, PCRT1\nand 2 that are dispersed throughout the centromere\nregion [30] and evidenced by the interspersed FISH signal\nwith the LTR-homologous probe U30 (Fig.3C). In S.hab-\nrochaites, two of the nine LycEPRV loci were actually\nflanked on both sides by PCRT1. Also the tomato BAC\nclone AC171732 revealed PCRT1 sequences in the region\nflanking the LycEPRV copy. Associations of tobacco, petu-\nnia and banana EPRV sequences with Metaviridae ele-\nments have also been noted [1,3,6,8]. These associations\nmay be random, due to preferential integration of either\nelement in the other, or due to co-amplification of both\nelements. If retroelements constitute some 50% of the\ngenome [24,45,46], then the association is little different\nfrom random, particularly if there is a preference for\nEPRVs and metaviridae elements to cluster in the genomic\nregions such as the centromere (see Fig.3 and [4,8] for\npetunia and potato). Nevertheless, it is tempting to sug-\ngest functional associations: pararetroviruses do not\nencode an integrase, so intact retrotransposons may sup-\nply this function in trans and related structural sites [14].\nPararetroviruses that insert into retrotransposon struc-\ntures may be coamplified as chimerical structures or by\ntemplate switches of RT to viral transcripts [47], in addi-\ntion to other mechanisms of repetitive sequence amplifi-\ncation (see [48]), such as unequal and illegitimate\ncrossing over or replication slippage of conserved short\nrepeats as are found within the LycEPRVs and related\nsequences.\nCytosine methylation within LycEPRV sequences was\nobserved in both CHG and asymmetrical CHH contexts\n(Fig.4). CHH methylation in particular is a hallmark of\nRNA-directed DNA methylation in plants [19]. Similar\npatterns of EPRV methylation have been observed in Petu-\nnia [49] and N. tabacum [15]. There is evidence that cyto-\nsine methylation subdues EPRVs in different species. In\npetunia, endogenous Petunia vein clearing virus looses\nmethylation upon reactivation in Petunia hybrida [8]. In\ntobacco, regulatory IGR sequences of NsEPRV introduced\nstably into tobacco became a target of methylation and\nwere transcriptionally silenced [15]. In rice, the copy\nnumber of endogenous Rice tungro bacilliform virus in dif-\nferent strains was directly proportional to the degree of\nDNA methylation and virus resistance [9]. Whether the\nobserved cytosine methylation is responsible for tran-\nscriptionally silencing copies of LycEPRV is not known.\nClearly, at least some copies of LycEPRV are transcribed, as\ndemonstrated by the detection of transcripts derived from\nthe LycEPRV sequences in healthy plants and homologous\nESTs in databases (Fig.5). Whether these transcripts are\ninitiated from a promoter within an EPRV sequence or\nfrom a flanking plant promoter is not known. Most ESTs\ncorrespond to the TAV region and sequence heterogeneity,\nincluding frameshifts and stop codons, suggests that the\ntranscripts are probably non-functional and derived fromPage 12 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:24 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/7\/24more than one locus in the genome. The absence of copies\nwith a full-length coding sequence or a functional pro-\nmoter region in the genomic library does not exclude the\nexistence of a full copy elsewhere in the genome since the\ncDNAs were not identical to the genomic copies\nsequenced. EPRV-like EST matches from normal and\nstressed tissue respectively were also reported for the EPRV\nfamily SoTu in the potato genome [4].\nActivation of EPRVs to form virus particles that produce\nsymptoms of infection has been reported for endogenous\nBSV in banana [6,11,13], endogenous TVCV in Nicotiana\nedwardsonii [2], and ePVCV in Petunia [8]. In most cases,\nactivation occurred in interspecific hybrids and was\nenhanced by an additional abiotic stress (such as in vitro\npropagation\/tissue culture, changes in the light regime, or\nfrequent wounding) [2,8,11,12]. By contrast, symptoms\nof virus infection due to activation of latent LycEPRV were\nnot observed in new interspecific hybrids grown under\ngreenhouse conditions and stressed by frequent trim-\nming. Whether this is due to stable silencing of as-yet-uni-\ndentified non-defective copies of LycEPRV in hybrids or to\nthe general lack of potentially reactivatable copies is not\nknown. Additionally also the absence of an asymmetric\nratio of EPRV copies between parental genomes may have\nprevented a reactivation as this seems to enable the forma-\ntion of episomal virus from integrated copies in other\nhybrid genomes [10,2,11]. The function of the LycEPRV\ntranscripts in asymptomatic plants is unclear but it is\ntempting to speculate that they repress the pathogenicity\nof endogenous pararetroviruses, perhaps by an RNA-\nbased gene silencing mechanism(s) [15]. This idea is sup-\nported by the detection of at least some CHH methylation\nin LycEPRVs and the presence of short RNAs with hom-\nology to LycEPRVs in healthy plants (Fig.6). Moreover the\nincreased level of 21\u201322nt short RNAs in plants infected\nwith a heterologous virus encoding suppressors of PTGS\nsuggests a role in a constitutive RNAi\/PTGS pathway. By\ncontrast, significant amounts of short RNAs could be\ndetected in petunia only in symptomatic tissue after acti-\nvation of endogenous PVCV sequence(s) or after infection\nwith PVCV by inoculation [49].\nThe presence of two size classes of short RNA, which have\nbeen implicated previously in triggering either PTGS (21\nnt) or Translational Gene Silencing (TGS) and RNA-\ndirected chromatin modifications (24 nt) [50], could pro-\nvide a multi-pronged defense against endogenous or exog-\nenous forms of the virus. The accumulation of 21\u201322nt\nLycEPRV short RNAs after heterologous virus infection\nwith two different points of interaction in the silencing\nprocess supports the involvement of PTGS for such a\ndefence. Given the complex and interconnected nature of\nRNA-mediated silencing pathways [16,51-53], and the fit-\nness advantage of suppressing viral infection, RNA-medi-\nated silencing of EPRVs might involve several species of\nshort RNAs, RNA-directed DNA methylation, and both\nPTGS and TGS pathways.\nMethods\nPlant material and DNA isolation\nSeeds of Solanum lycopersicum L.

S.lycopersicum (\"Money-\nmaker\") lines were obtained from D. Scharf, Frankfurt\nUniversity. Plants were grown in the greenhouse.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from leaves with the DNeasy\nPlant Maxi kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's\ninstructions.\n\u03bb-library and sequencing\nTwo genomic DNA libraries were prepared from Solanum\nlycopersicum (\"MicroTom\") and S.habrochaites using the \u03bb-\nFIX II system (Stratagene) according to the protocols pro-\nvided by the supplier. The libraries were screened with a\nsubcloned 5.5 kb NotI-HindIII fragment of NsEPRV clone\nV6 corresponding to the approximate NsEPRV nucleotide\npositions 2\u20137.5 kb [1]. \u039b-DNA was isolated using the\nLambda Midi Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with fluores-\ncent chain terminators (ABI PRISM 3100 system). For\nanalysis of DNA sequences the software programs BLAST\n[54] and CLUSTAL [55,56] were used, homology searches\nemployed public domain sequence databases (GenBank,\nEMBL, DDBJ, SwissProt, PDB, PIR, PRF). GenBank\/EMBL\/\nDDBJ accession numbers for sequences reported in this\npaper are DQ273220\u2013DQ273264.\nSouthern hybridization\nFor Southern hybridization 1 to 2 \u03bcg of genomic DNA was\nsequentially digested with XbaI and an additional enzyme\nof the appropriate isoschizomer pair, fractionated on\n1.5% agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes\n(Hybond N, Amersham) using standard techniques.

First strandPage 13 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:24 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/7\/24DNA was produced by Revert Aid H Minus M-MuLV\nReverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) according to standard\nprotocols and used in PCR reactions with the following\nprimer pairs: CP: 5'CWTGTTAYAAYTGYGGAAARWTAG-\nGAC 3'\/MP: 5'TTTCWATRGGNGTATCT ATTCCTTCTC 3'\nand TAV1: 5'RMWDNTANHAGTCAGCAGCATGAC 3'\/\nTAV2: 5' CATHRHYTGATCTCKTDHATARTA 3' for the\ncoding region (annealing temperature: 50\u00b0C) and IGR1:\n5'CWYTTAAGWTYATGAGTAGCTAWATTAATTTATTC-\nCTG 3'\/IGR2: 5' CCTCAAMTYTGTTTAMTC-\nCCCTAAACGG 3' (annealing temperature 56\u00b0C) for the\nintergenic region (Fig.5B). An actin sequence spanning an\nintron was amplified in parallel to detect genomic DNA\ncontaminations using the primer pair ActL: 5'GTTGCTAT-\nTCAGGCTGTGCT 3'\/ActR: 5'TCTTTTCAATGGAGGA\nGCTG 3' (annealing temperature: 50\u00b0C). Reactions (50\n\u03bcl) contained 50 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,\n150 \u03bcM dNTPs, 0.25U Taq Polymerase and ~50ng 1st\nstrand DNA. PCR products were gel purified and cloned\ninto the pGemT vector (Promega). In order to discrimi-\nnate between different copies, cloned fragments were\nHinfI restricted and separated on agarose gels. Fragments\nproducing different restriction patterns were sequenced.\nShort RNA extraction and hybridization\nRNA enriched for the low-molecular weight fraction (10\nto 100nt) was isolated from leaves and flowers, samples of\n50 \u03bcg per lane were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide\ngel containing 7 M urea and transferred onto nylon mem-\nbranes (Hybond N+, Amersham) following the protocols\ndescribed in [57]. The blots were hybridized with RNA\nprobes of both orientations derived from the cloned\ncDNA fragments of IGRcLe-8 (DQ273223) for the inter-\ngenic region and from pooled TAVcLe-4, TAVcLe-8, TAV-\ncLe-19 (DQ273225, DQ273229, DQ273228) for the TAV\nregion. Hybridization conditions and probe preparation\nwere following [57], omitting the probe fragmentation\nstep.\nHeterologous virus infection\nFor mechanical transmission trials, plants at the six leaf\nstage were inoculated with leaf extracts from S.lycopersicum\ninfected plants with Potato virus Y (PVY) strain PVY-NTN\n[58] or with Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) strain TBSV-\ntype [59], respectively. The virus strains were obtained\nfrom the Department of Plant Protection Virology, Uni-\nversity of Bari, Italy. Infected leaves were ground in 0.1 M\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 0.2% DIECA and the\nextract was rubbed on celite-dusted plants. The virus\nspread to younger leaves after 4\u20136 weeks post inoculation\nwas verified by ELISA using TBSV and PVY detection kits\n(LOEWE, Germany). An ELISA sample was taken as posi-\ntive when its OD value was at least three times higher than\nthe negative control values. All determinations were run\nin duplicate.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\nRoot tips from seedlings or plants growing in pots were\ntreated with 0.02 M 8- hydroxyquinoline, fixed in etha-\nnol: glacial acetic acid (3:1), digested with proteolytic\nenzymes, and dissected in 60% (v\/v) acetic acid. Chromo-\nsome preparations were either made by squashing [60] or\nspreading [61]. Flower buds were fixed untreated and\nanthers were dissected and the stage of meiosis deter-\nmined to be pachytene, before they were processed as\nabove.\nThe ribosomal probe (clone pTa71), contains a 9 kb EcoRI\nfragment of the repeat unit of 25S-5.8S-18S rDNA from T.\naestivum [62]. Part of the dispersed middle repetitive\ntomato sequence U30 [31] was amplified and cloned\nfrom S.lycopersicum (DQ273250). Mixtures of four probes\neach for S.lycopersicum and S.habrochaites (LycEPRV-Sl, Lyc-\nEPRV-Sh) were selected (Table 2). PCR amplified inserts\nof clones were labelled with biotin 16-dUTP (Roche) or\ndigoxigenin 11-dUTP (Roche) by random priming (Bio-\nprime & Random primer kit; Invitrogen).\nIn situ hybridization followed [60]. The hybridization\nmixture consisted of 50 to 100 ng\/slide of each probe,\n50% (v\/v) formamide, 2 \u00d7 SSC, 10% (v\/v) dextran sul-\nphate, 0.12% (w\/v) SDS, 0.12 mM EDTA (ethylene-\ndiamine-tetra-acetic acid) and 1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl salmon sperm\nDNA. After overnight hybridization, slides were washed in\n20% (v\/v) formamide\/0.1 \u00d7 SSC at 42\u00b0C, giving a hybrid-\nization stringency of 85%. Hybridization sites were\ndetected by streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 594 (Molec-\nular Probes) or FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) conju-\ngated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) in 4 \u00d7 SSC, 0.1%\n(v\/v) Tween-20, 5% (w\/v) BSA (bovine serum albumin).\nPreparations were stained with DAPI (4'-6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole) and analysed on an Axioplan 2 epifluores-\ncence microscope (Zeiss) with single band pass filters\nequipped with a cooled colour CCD camera (Optronics,\nmodel S97790). FISH and DAPI images were overlaid\nusing the RGB channels of Adobe Photoshop CS and CS2\nsoftware; DAPI images were sharpened using the Gaussian\ndeblur function and colour balance and processing of the\nFISH signal was achieved using only those function that\ntreat all pixels equally. For the pachytene overlay figures\n(Figs. 3E and 3F) the captured colour images were con-\nverted to gray image, enhanced and overlaid: DAPI images\nwere left B&W and the FISH signals were falsely coloured\nred and green, respecively. Each hybridization experiment\nwas at least carried out twice and for each probe eight to\ntwenty cells were analysed.\nAuthors' contributions\nCS carried out sequencing and bioinformatics, methyla-\ntion and expression analysis as well as the detection of\nshort RNAs, participated in and helped designing the\nFISH experiments and virus infections and drafted the\nmanuscript.
