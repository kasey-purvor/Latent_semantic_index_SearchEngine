Although the concept of \"accessibil-\nity\" is multidimensional (accessibility may be defined in\nterms of affordability, acceptability, availability and spa-\ntial accessibility [1]) evaluating geographical accessibility\nin residential areas offers critical information for public\npolicy in planning and service provision as it allows for\nthe identification of areas with lower (or higher) access to\nurban resources and the assessment of spatial and social\ninequalities in access [2,3].\nGeographical accessibility refers to the ease with which\nresidents of a given area can reach services and facilities\n[2]. Most common approaches for defining geographical\naccessibility are based on distance or travel time to a\nresource (for a review, please refer to [4]). These measures\nassume that every member of the population is a potential\nuser of the service; the pattern of spatial accessibility will\ndepend on the relative location of the population and\nservices [5,6]. Table 1 synthesises approaches for concep-\ntualizing and measuring different dimensions of geo-\ngraphical accessibility.\nSeveral studies have measured the geographical accessibil-\nity in residential areas of services and facilities that have\nthe potential to contribute to the population's well-being\nand health such as health care services [2,7-18], recrea-\ntional facilities [2,16,18,19], and food supermarkets\n[16,18,20-23]. Accessibility to these types of resources is\nespecially important for populations with limited mobil-\nity and revenue since more direct and easier access confers\nopportunities by reducing the time and financial costs of\naccess, and by potentially influencing life choices [24].\nOther studies have measured geographical accessibility of\nresources potentially associated with more negative\nhealth outcomes, such as waste facilities, fast food restau-\nrants, and pollution from large motorways [25-27].\nOver the past two decades, the operationalization of geo-\ngraphical accessibility measures in urban and health stud-\nies has become easier, largely due to developments in GIS\ntransportation softwares and modules. These measures\nrequire the specification of a set of four parameters,\nnamely 1) a spatial unit of reference for the population,\ni.e. a definition of residential areas; 2) an aggregation\nmethod, i.e. to account for the distribution of population\nin the residential area; 3) a measure of accessibility; and 4)\na type of distance for computing the accessibility meas-\nures selected. The choice of these parameters is likely to\ngenerate different results, potentially leading to significant\nmeasurement errors [2,28,29].\nIn this paper, we investigate differences in results when\ngeographical accessibility of residential areas (census\ntracts) to health care services is computed using different\ndistances types and different aggregation methods. In the\nnext section, we describe methods for defining the four\nparameters for computing accessibility measures. With\nthese methods in mind, we then provide an overview of\nmethodological issues in measuring accessibility.\nEvaluating geographical accessibility of services and \nfacilities in residential areas: specifying a set of parameters\nSpatial unit of reference and aggregation methods\nSelecting the appropriate spatial unit of analysis, i.e. the\noperational definition for residential areas, is critical for\nminimizing aggregation errors [2,30]. Aggregation error\narises from the distribution of individuals around the cen-\ntroid of spatial units [2]. As spatial units vary in size from\nsmaller areas, e.g. census blocks, to larger ones, e.g. census\ntracts, accessibility measured for smaller units is less sub-\nject to aggregation error than that measured for larger spa-\ntial units [2].\nTo evaluate the geographical accessibility of a service for a\npopulation living in a residential area, e.g. a census tract,\nthree methods can be used [2]; they are illustrated in Fig-\nure 1. The first method consists in computing the distance\nbetween the centroid of the census tract and the service\n(Figure 1.a). This method shows the inappropriateness of\nignoring the spatial distribution of the population inside\nthe census tract [2].\nThe second method consists of calculating the popula-\ntion-weighted mean centre of the census tracts (Equation\nTable 1: Approaches for conceptualizing and measuring the geographical accessibility of services and facilities for residential areas\nConceptualization Accessibility measures\nImmediate proximity The distance between a location and the closest facility\nAvailability within one area unit The number of facilities contained within a given unit (for example, census tract)\nAvailability provided by the immediate surroundings The number of facilities within a given distance from a point of origin\nAverage cost to reach all destinations The average distance between a location and all facilities\nAverage cost to reach diversity The average distance between a location and n facilities\nAdapted from Talen [41] and Apparicio et al.

Toward this end, smaller spatial\nunits entirely contained by the census tracts can be used,\nsuch as dissemination areas, census blocks, or postal\ncodes. This method accounts for the spatial distribution of\nthe population inside the census tract in order to mini-\nmize aggregation error.\nWhere:\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i (i.e. dissemination area or census block or\npostal code).\nxb and yb = X and Y coordinates of spatial unit b.\nx y\nwbxb\nb i\nwb\nb i\nwbyb\nk i\nwb\nb i\ni i, ,( ) = \u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u239b\n\u239d\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\n(1)\nChoosing the spatial unit of reference for calculating distances and error aggregationFigure 1\nChoosing the spatial unit of reference for calculating distances and error aggregation.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 4 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nFinally, the third method consists of computing the dis-\ntance between the services and each centroid of spatial\nunits completely within census tracts, and then calculat-\ning the average of these distances weighted by the total\npopulation of each unit (Figure 1.b and 1c). In compari-\nson with the previous methods, this one is more accurate\nbecause it more exactly accounts for the distribution of the\npopulation inside the census tract.\nAccessibility measures\nThe five most commonly used measures of accessibility\nare: 1) the distance to the closest service, 2) the number of\nservices within n metres or minutes, 3) the mean distance\nto all services, 4) the mean distance to n closest services,\nand 5) the gravity model. If the more accurate aggregation\nmethod detailed previously is selected, these accessibility\nmeasures can be written as:\nWhere:\n = mean distance between census tract i and closest\nservice.\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i.\ndbs = distance between spatial unit b and service s.\nWhere:\n = mean number of services within n metres or min-\nutes of census tract i.\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i.\nS = all services.\nSj = number of services within n metres or minutes of spa-\ntial unit centroid b with Sj = 1 where dbs \u2264 n and Sj = 0\nwhere dbs > n.\n = mean distance between census tract i population\nand all services.\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i.\ndbs = distance between spatial unit centroid b and service s.\n = mean distance between census tract i and n closest\nservices.\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i.\ndbs = distance between spatial unit centroid b and service s,\ndbs is sorted in ascending order.\nn = number of closest services to be included in measure.\n = mean value of potential gravity.\nwb = total population of spatial unit b completely within\ncensus tract i.\nS = number of services in study area.\ndbs = distance between spatial unit centroid b and service s.\n\u03b1 = friction parameter (usually 1, 1.5 or 2).\nSws = weight given to the service s such as its size (for exam-\nple, number of beds for a hospital).\nTypes of distance\nFour types of distance are typically used for calculating\naccessibility measures: Euclidean distance (straight-line),\nManhattan distance (distance along two sides of a right-\nangled triangle opposed to the hypotenuse), shortest net-\nZ\nwb dbs\nb i\nwb\nb i\ni\na\n=\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n(min )\n, (2)\nZi\na\nZ\nW S\nW\ni\nb\nb\nb i\nj\nj S\nb\nb i\n=\n\u2208 \u2208\n\u2208\n\u2211 \u2211\n\u2211 , (3)\nZi\nb\nZ\nwbdbs\nb i\nwb\nb i\ni\nc\n=\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211 ,\n(4)\nZi\nc\nZ\nwb\ndbs\nnsb i\nwb\nb i\ni\nd\n=\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211 ,\n(5)\nZi\nd\nZ\nwb Swsdbs\nSb i\nwb\nb i\ni\ne\n=\n\u2212\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\n\u2208\n\u2211\na\n, (6)\nZi\ne\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 5 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwork distance and shortest network time (Figure 2)\n[28,31]. Euclidean and Manhattan distances can easily be\ncomputed using geographic coordinates:\ndij = |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, (8)\nWhere:\nXi and Yi = X and Y coordinates of point i with a plane pro-\njection.\nOn the other hand, calculation of network distance and\nnetwork time distance \u2013 which represent respectively the\nshortest and fastest paths between two points using a\nstreet network \u2013 is more complex. Indeed, the computa-\ntion of these two distances necessitates geometric network\nfiles \u2013 with directions, speed limits, turning restrictions,\nand delays available for each street segment \u2013 integrated\ninto GIS, and a GIS module or GIS software specialized in\ntransportation analysis (ESRI Network Analyst Extension\nor TransCad software, for example).\nShortest network and network time distances represent\ntwo different objectives. Shortest network distance is use-\nful for evaluating the path between two points as if taken\non foot; consequently, it is frequently used in studies on\nthe accessibility of \"proximal\" services and facilities\n[4,18,20,32-34]. Shortest time distance is more accurate\nfor evaluating distances by car or public transportation.\nMethodological issues and accuracy in measuring \ngeographical accessibility\nWhen evaluating geographical accessibility, the choice of\nthese parameters is likely to generate different results,\npotentially leading to significant measurement errors\n[2,28,29].\nMost studies examining the geographical accessibility of\nhealth care and health-related services have been con-\ncerned with measuring the accessibility of the closest facil-\nity using Euclidean distance [2,13], shortest network\ndistance [8,18,32], shortest network time distance\n[9,11,16,17,35], or a combination of distance types\n[10,12,15]. Others have also examined proximity to diver-\nsity by measuring the average shortest network distance to\nselected services [32], and the offer provided by the imme-\ndiate surroundings, i.e. of the number of services within a\ngiven distance [7,14,18,32]. Few studies have conceptual-\nized different dimensions of geographical accessibility\nwithin one investigation (for exceptions, see [14,15,32]),\nalthough this would be useful in order to describe the\ncomplexity of geographical accessibility of a given service\n[32]. Furthermore, within a given set of data, the choice of\nthe accessibility measure is fundamental since accessibil-\nity varies depending on the indicator used [3,4,36].\nSome studies have compared discrepancies in results\nwhen geographical accessibility was measured using dif-\nferent types of distances. In a study exploring trade-offs\nbetween various types of distance, Apparicio and col-\nleagues [28] compared distance matrices based on simple\n(Euclidean, Manhattan) and network (road, time) meas-\nures of distance between all census tracts in Canada's eight\nlargest metropolitan areas. They examined whether the\nEuclidean and Manhattan approximations are correlated\nwith a more accurate measure of distance, i.e. travel time\nalong the road network, at the metropolitan and census\ntract levels. The authors concluded that, at the metropoli-\ntan level, the use of Euclidean or Manhattan distances to\nestimate shortest network time does not introduce major\nerrors. However, in sub-metropolitan areas, or areas\nlocated away from the central business district, the use of\nEuclidean or Manhattan approximations of shortest net-\nwork time may lead to substantial errors. In measuring\naccessibility in these areas, network-based distance\/time\nmatrices may provide more appropriate results. Similar\nresults were also observed [10,12,15].\nd x x y yij i j i j= \u2212 + \u2212( ) ( ) ,\n2 2 (7)\nSeveral types of distanceFigure 2\nSeveral types of distance.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 6 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWith respect to operational definition of residential areas,\na wide variety of area units has been used, ranging from\nsmaller units such as census meshblocks [9,10,16,18],\nenumeration districts [11,13] and census output areas\n[12] to larger units such as census tracts [7,17,32,35],\ncommunities and city-defined neighbourhoods [2,8], and\nwards [13-15]. Some studies have controlled for the loca-\ntion of the population within the spatial unit by calculat-\ning the population-weighted mean centre of the spatial\nunit [12,14,16,17,35] or by calculating the population-\nweighted mean accessibility of smaller spatial units\nlocated within the spatial unit of interest [2,13,32]. None-\ntheless, a considerable number of studies do not employ\nmethods for minimizing aggregation errors, i.e. they com-\npute accessibility for the geometric centroid of the spatial\nunit.\nFor public policy and planning, measuring geographical\naccessibility of urban resources and facilities is of interest\nas it conveys information on the presence of enabling\nresources [37] or opportunity structures [38] in the resi-\ndential environment. Geographical accessibility measures\nare however prone to a variety of methodological prob-\nlems, among which is error induced by using different dis-\ntance types [28] and aggregation methods [2,29].\nStudy objectives\nIn this paper, we investigate differences in results when\ngeographical accessibility of residential areas (census\ntracts) to selected health care services is computed using\ndifferent distances types and different aggregation meth-\nods. Specific objectives are to: 1) Compare measures of\ndistances; and 2) Estimate aggregation errors for several\naccessibility measures.\nData and methods\nStudy area and health services\nThis study focuses on the Montr\u00e9al census metropolitan\narea (CMA) which has a population of about 3.4 million\ninhabitants. The territory of the Montr\u00e9al CMA is divided\ninto 852 census tracts, 5,829 dissemination areas and\n25,767 blocks with respective average population sizes of\n4,022, 588 and 133 inhabitants, as defined by Statistics\nCanada. A total of 642 health services grouped into eight\ncategories were integrated into geographic information\nsystems (ArcGis) by geocoding addresses (Figure 3). These\nhealth services were inventoried from the website of the\nMinist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux du Qu\u00e9bec\n(Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services). Of the\n642 services, 65 are located in a 10 km buffer zone around\nthe boundaries of the Montr\u00e9al CMA. These 65 services\nwere included in order to prevent underestimation of\naccessibility in the bordering zones of the Montr\u00e9al CMA.\nComparing distance types\nTo explore variations in results according to distance type,\nwe calculate the four distance types \u2013 Euclidean, Manhat-\ntan, shortest network path and shortest network time dis-\ntances \u2013 between the 642 health services and the centroids\nof census tracts, dissemination areas and blocks. In total,\nmore than 83 million distances are computed (Table 2),\nwith SAS software for Euclidean and Manhattan distances,\nand with the Network Analyst Extension of ArcView 3.3\n[39] by using CanMap Streetfiles from DMTI [40] for\nshortest network and shortest network time distances.\nOnce these four distance types are computed, correlation\nanalyses are performed globally and locally across entire\ncensus tract, dissemination area and block matrices. First,\nthe global analysis, which yields one value for the CMA as\na whole, allows us to assess the degree of correlation\nbetween the four distance types. Then, we examine corre-\nlations between the four distances for each spatial unit\ncentroids and the 642 health services. This local analysis\nstage yields one mappable value for each census tract, dis-\nsemination area and block and allows to identify spatial\nvariation in the degree of correlation between the four dis-\ntance types.\nEvaluating aggregation errors when measuring \ngeographical accessibility\nThe same approach, i.e. global and local analyses, was\nused to evaluate aggregation errors for several accessibility\nmeasures at the census tract level. The global analysis\ninvolves calculating correlations between three aggrega-\ntion methods: 1) the census tract centroid; 2) the popula-\ntion-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for\ndissemination areas within census tracts; and 3) the pop-\nulation-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for\nblocks within census tracts, the most accurate method.\nAlthough accessibility was computed for each of the eight\ncategories of health services, for purposes of conciseness,\nresults are reported only for accessibility of general and\nspecialized care i.e. hospitals (n = 56) for census tracts. It\nis worth noting, that similar patterns of correlation were\nobserved for other health services.\nResults\nCorrelations between the four types of distances\nGlobal correlations\nTable 3 presents results for global correlation coefficients\nbetween the four types of distances computed for the\nentire sample of health services (n = 642). Three observa-\ntions can be made. First, at the metropolitan scale, inde-\npendently of the type of distance used, results are globally\nsimilar as indicated by high correlation coefficient values\n(greater than 0.95). Second, in comparison with Manhat-\ntan distance, Euclidean distance is most strongly corre-\nlated with the more accurate network path and time\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 7 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCategories of health services for the Montr\u00e9al CMA, 2006Figure 3\nCategories of health services for the Montr\u00e9al CMA, 2006.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 8 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndistances. Thus, if it is impossible to compute network\ndistance in a study focussing on geographical accessibility\nin the Montr\u00e9al CMA, Euclidean distance seems prefera-\nble to Manhattan distance. These results are in line with\nthose of Apparicio et al. [28] for eight Canadian metropol-\nitan areas (Toronto, Montr\u00e9al, Vancouver, Ottawa-Hull,\nCalgary, Edmonton, Qu\u00e9bec and Winnipeg), and with\nthose of Fone et al. [12] for Caerphilly county borough in\nWales. Finally, as expected, correlations between both net-\nwork distances are almost perfect (0.992). This means that\nif directions and speed limits are unknown for computing\nthe shortest network time, the shortest network distance is\na very reliable alternative.\nLocal correlations\nAlthough global correlations are high, they are not perfect\n(values differ from one). For this reason, local variations\nat the intra-metropolitan scale must exist and should be\nexamined in detail. Figure 4 presents local Pearson coeffi-\ncients between Euclidean distance and shortest network\ntime, and between Euclidean and Manhattan distances for\nthe geographical accessibility of the 642 health services\ncomputed from the centroids of census tracts, dissemina-\ntion areas, and blocks.\nResults show similar spatial patterns for the three spatial\nscales (census tract, dissemination area and block): with\nincreasing distance from the central business district, cor-\nrelations are reduced between Euclidean distance and\nshortest network time, and between Euclidean and Man-\nhattan distances. For all spatial units in the centre of the\nIsland of Montr\u00e9al and those located on the south shore,\ncorrelations are higher. For those located on the periphery\nof the CMA, notably on the north shore, characterized by\nsuburban areas, correlations are weaker, often lower than\n0.9.\nThese results illustrate that for the Island of Montr\u00e9al,\nintegrating Euclidean distances at the census tract, dissem-\nination area and block levels into statistical analysis, e.g.\nin regression or multilevel analysis, would yield similar\nresults to those obtained if network distances were com-\nputed. However, if the focus is on the CMA as a whole, or\non specific parts of the CMA, namely, those located in the\nnorthern suburbs, then results are likely to vary as a func-\nTable 2: Distances calculated between health services and spatial units\nSpatial units (origins) Health services (destinations) Types of distance* Distances calculated\nType N\nCensus tracts 852 642 4 2,187,936\nDissemination areas 5,829 642 4 14,968,872\nBlocks 25,767 642 4 66,169,656\nTotal 32,448 642 4 83,326,464\n* Euclidean, Manhattan, shortest network distance, shortest network time.\nTable 3: Global Pearson correlations between alternative types of distance\nCartesian system Shortest network\nDistance Euclidean Manhattan Distance Time\nDistances between census tracts and health services (N) 546,984 546,984 546,984 546,984\nEuclidean 1.000\nManhattan 0.987 1.000\nDistance 0.988 0.971 1.000\nTime 0.976 0.959 0.992 1.000\nDistances between dissemination areas and health services (N) 3,742,218 3,742,218 3,742,218 3,742,218\nEuclidean 1.000\nManhattan 0.986 1.000\nDistance 0.987 0.969 1.000\nTime 0.975 0.957 0.992 1.000\nDistances between blocks and health services (N) 16,542,414 16,542,414 16,542,414 16,542,414\nEuclidean 1.000\nManhattan 0.985 1.000\nDistance 0.984 0.964 1.000\nTime 0.970 0.950 0.992 1.000\nNote: All coefficient values are significant at the p < 0.0001 level.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 9 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nComparing alternative types of distance between spatial units and health services using local Pearson correlationsFigure 4\nComparing alternative types of distance between spatial units and health services using local Pearson correla-\ntions.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 10 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntion of the distance type used to compute geographical\naccessibility.\nAggregation errors\nGlobal errors\nThe global analysis of aggregation errors is performed by\nmeans of Spearman correlations between the three meth-\nods of aggregation used to calculated 20 accessibility\nmeasures at the census tract level using the more accurate\ndistances (network distances). Results are shown in Table\n4 for hospitals only, although similar patterns of correla-\ntion were observed for other health services.\nCorrelations between the three aggregation methods are\nhigh (>0.9) for all measures of accessibility except for the\nnumber of services within 500, 1000 and 2000 metres.\nFor example, correlation between the least exact aggrega-\ntion method (census tract centroid) and the most exact\nbased on blocks within census tracts is 0.588 for the\nnumber of hospitals within 500 metres, 0.776 for those\nwithin 1000 metres, and 0.898 for those within 2000\nmetres. This means that if we want to assess service provi-\nsion in a close-proximity area around a census tract, it is\npreferable to use an aggregation method that precisely\naccounts for the distribution of population within it; if\nnot, the risk of error might be considerable.\nTable 4: Spearman rank correlations between measures of the accessibility of hospitals by aggregation method\nAccessibility measures using shortest network distance Accessibility measures using shortest network time\nHospitals CTCa WDAb WBlc CTCa WDAb WBlc\nMinimum network \ndistance\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.991 1.000 0.987 1.000 0.997\nWBlc 0.989 0.997 1.000 0.984 0.997 1.000\nAverage distance to three \nclosest services\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.997 1.000 0.995 1.000\nWBlc 0.997 0.999 1.000 0.994 0.999 1.000\nAverage distance to five \nclosest services\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.998 1.000 0.996 1.000\nWBlc 0.998 0.999 1.000 0.995 0.999 1.000\nAverage distance to all \nservices\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.998 1.000 0.995 1.000\nWBlc 0.999 0.999 1.000 0.995 0.998 1.000\nNumber of services within \n500 metres\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.604 1.000 0.993 1.000\nWBlc 0.588 0.838 1.000 0.992 0.999 1.000\nNumber of services within \n1000 metres\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.828 1.000 0.990 1.000\nWBlc 0.776 0.924 1.000 0.990 0.998 1.000\nNumber of services within \n2000 metres\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.916 1.000 0.978 1.000\nWBlc 0.898 0.968 1.000 0.976 0.996 1.000\nGravity model with \u03b1 = 1 CTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.994 1.000 0.992 1.000\nWBlc 0.993 0.998 1.000 0.990 0.997 1.000\nGravity model with \u03b1 = \n1.5\nCTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.993 1.000 0.990 1.000\nWBlc 0.992 0.996 1.000 0.988 0.996 1.000\nGravity model with \u03b1 = 2 CTCa 1.000 1.000\nWDAb 0.991 1.000 0.987 1.000\nWBlc 0.991 0.995 1.000 0.986 0.994 1.000\na Aggregation method based on census tract centroid (the least accurate method).\nb Aggregation method based on the population-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for dissemination areas within census tracts.\nc Aggregation method based on the population-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for blocks within census tracts (the most accurate \nmethod).\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 11 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLocal errors\nA second stage of comparison of aggregation methods\nconsists in assessing the absolute difference between the\ngeographical accessibility results obtained from the meth-\nods based on census tract and dissemination areas centro-\nids in relation to the most accurate method based on\nblocks within census tracts. The descriptive statistics for\nlocal errors are reported in Table 5 for hospitals.\nNot surprisingly, the local errors are on the whole quite\nsmall, though not insignificant: for example, compared\nwith the most accurate method, the census tract centroid\nmethod misestimates the distance to the closest hospital\nby an average of 365 m, and the dissemination area\nmethod by an average of 134 m. Up to the third quartile\n(75%), the local errors are still quite small: for 75% of\ncensus tracts, the error associated with the census tract\ncentroid approach is less than 365 m. However, in 10% of\ncases, the error is greater than 948 m, and in 5% of census\ntracts the error is greater than 1.5 km (Table 5).

However, if one wishes to reach more precise\nconclusions for specific neighbourhoods, major errors\nappear for 5% to 10% of census tracts.\nConclusion\nOver the past two decades, an increasing number of\nhealth studies have integrated the geographical accessibil-\nity of services and facilities as an important dimension of\nthe built urban environment. The development of GIS\nwith transportation module (ESRI Network Analyst Exten-\nsion, for example) has largely fostered this increase. How-\never, the results reported in this paper show that measures\nof geographical accessibility of urban health services may\nvary according to the distance type and aggregation\nmethod selected.\nAlthough Euclidean and Manhattan distances are strongly\ncorrelated with network distances, local variations are\nnonetheless observed, notably in suburban areas. The\nchoice of the aggregation method is also important: acces-\nsibility measures computed from census tract centroids,\nthough not inaccurate, yield important measurement\nerrors for 5% to 10% of census tracts. This is especially so\nin census tracts with lower population density and in\nthose where the land use is largely non-residential.\nBecause the accessibility of health services may be more\nproblematic in suburban areas than in more central urban\nareas, geographical accessibility studies should be based\non the most accurate measures. Thus, using the smallest\narea unit possible included in the spatial unit of interest\nappears to be a relevant alternative for minimizing aggre-\ngation errors.\nResults obtained for Montreal \u2013 comparison of the four\ntypes of distances and evaluation of aggregation errors \u2013\nmay be generalisable to other North American cities\nwhere urban forms are similar. For example, in a study\naiming at comparing types of distances, Apparicio and\ncolleagues observed similar results for the eight largest\nCanadian metropolitan areas [28]. Moreover, results can\nalso be extended to other services and amenities (not only\nEvaluating local aggregation errors for hospitalsFig re 5\nEvaluating local aggregation errors for hospitals.\nInternational Journal of Health Geographics 2008, 7:7 http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\nPage 13 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfor health services) although the magnitude of aggrega-\ntion errors may likely vary [2].\nComputing accessibility measures in GIS using network\ndistances and more precise aggregation methods is no\nlonger a daunting task. Nowadays, software and modules\ndedicated to network analysis are effective and user-\nfriendly, notably the Network Analyst Extension of ArcGIS\nor the TransCad software. Moreover, street network data\nare easily accessible (for example, Statistics Canada or\nDMTI data). Because the calculation speed of computers is\nexponential, the time required for the computation of\nnumerous network distances is no longer a limitation.\nConsequently, although errors associated with the choice\nof distance types are important for about 10% of census\ntracts, we should not avoid using the best estimation\nmethod possible for evaluating geographical accessibility.\nThis is especially so if accessibility measures to health serv-\nices or health-related resources are to be included as a\ndimension of the built environment in studies investigat-\ning residential area effects on health outcomes. Impreci-\nsion of accessibility measures could lead to errors or lack\nof precision in the estimation of area effects on health.\nFuture studies should investigate the extent of aggregation\nerrors occurring when measuring accessibility to other\ntypes of services and amenities, but also in other cities\nwhere urban form may differ from that of North American\ncities, and finally in rural context where geographical\naccessibility is an important issue.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPA and MA are the principal investigators of the study.\nThey carried out the GIS, statistical and mapping analyses.\nMR reviewed the literature and wrote parts of the paper.\nAll authors jointly drafted and critically revised the paper,\nand read and approved the final manuscript.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful \ncomments on the original version of this paper.
