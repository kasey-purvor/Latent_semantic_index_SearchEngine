And yet, simply to list the texts in all their generic and linguis-\ntic variety speaks compellingly to Newman\u2019s argument for the central-\nity of  the goddesses in medieval Christian imaginative literature and\ndevotion.\nThe penultimate chapter, \u201cMaria: Holy Trinity as Holy Family,\u201d is\nNewman at her theological and critical best. \u201cWhat if  Freud had been\na medievalist?\u201d (245), she asks not entirely whimsically. \u201cHe would\nhave spoken with the voice of  Jean Gerson\u201d (290), who, like many a\nchurchman and secular medievalist since, found Mary\u2019s incestuous, if\nheavenly, intermarriage with her divine Father and God-man Son, as\nimaged in the Coronation of  the Virgin by the Trinity, not only dis-\ntasteful but threatening, promising as it does unmediated union with\nthe divine for every elect soul. Newman notes that what sets Freud\n(and Gerson) off  from the medieval poets, artists, liturgists, and mys-\ntics who invoked the goddesses so flamboyantly in their imaginative\ncreations is that \u201cFreud was a pessimist,\u201d whereas the latter were\n\u201ctranscendental optimists who believed that \u2018with God all things are\npossible\u2019 \u201d (283). It is this sense of  possibility\u2014for imagination, for\ncreativity, but, above all, for belief\u2014that makes all of  Newman\u2019s work,\nand this book in particular, such a joy but also such a challenge. Artis-\ntically as well as religiously, Newman herself  believes in the possibility\nof  our divinizing ascent.\nRachel Fulton\nUniversity of Chicago\nDefending Literature in Early Modern England: Renaissance Literary\nTheory in Social Context. Robert Matz. Cambridge: Cambridge Uni-\nversity Press, 2000. Pp. xi+188.\nThis book would have been better served by the title of  the disserta-\ntion upon which it is based, \u201cFor Profit and Pleasure: The Writing of\nSocial Transformation in Elyot, Sidney, and Spenser\u201d ( Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, 1995). Robert Matz really is not interested in defenses of\nliterature per se, and he certainly is not concerned to examine the\nwhole field of  \u201cdefending literature in early modern England.\u201d What\nhe has provided, far more modestly, is linked studies of  three sixteenth-\ncentury authors in their capacities as champions of  literary study or\nof  literary production. As the original title indicates, what Matz is\nmost interested in is how and why his three authors champion litera-\nture in the name of  the Horatian commonplace, \u201caut prodesse . . . aut\nM O D E R N  P H I L O L O G Y418\ndelectare,\u201d for profit and pleasure, for instruction and delight. In\nMatz\u2019s study, profit and pleasure were a mobile pair of  terms for argu-\nments and representations through which literary-minded gentlemen\nattempted to wrest a form of  cultural capital out of  their otherwise\nendangered inclinations, tastes, and talents.\n\u201cHoratian poetics,\u201d Matz writes, \u201cmarks a struggle between domi-\nnant and subordinate members of  the sixteenth-century elite\u201d (1). Sir\nThomas Elyot was minor gentry, yet he posited a humanist revision\nof  aristocratic culture that was hostile to its traditional, prehumanist\nwarrior mentality, though it was also deeply conservative. Sir Philip\nSidney, of  course, was high gentry, if  not as wealthy as he might have\nbeen, but he found himself  called upon to represent all the highest\nideals of  courtly culture: sprezzatura \u00e0 la Castiglione; the militancy\nof  the Protestant Reformation; the traditional values of  aristocratic\nprivilege; and the self-fashioning impulses of  self-made men. Edmund\nSpenser\u2019s problems with status, privilege, Protestant ethics, and the\naccumulation of  wealth are so well known that they hardly need re-\nhearsing. These authors felt called upon to defend literary endeavors\nby way of  \u201cHoratian poetics\u201d not so much to exonerate the literary\nper se as to \u201cmediate,\u201d as Matz frequently puts it, between the con-\nflicting claims placed upon these authors by the social and cultural\ncontradictions in which they were enmeshed.\nSo far so good, and what ensues are three apparently cogent and\nsure-handed, if  overly discursive, accounts of  the three authors. We\nfollow parallel trajectories as Elyot tries to remake society through\nlearning in The Boke Named the Governor (1531), as Sidney tries to\nremake the courtier through the apologetics of  his Defence of Poetry\n(1595), and as Spenser tries to fashion the new middle-class gentle-\nman in the second book of  The Faerie Queene (1590). But something is\nwrong here. Matz\u2019s theses, so far as his work can be said to have such,\nare a bit slippery. What cultural contradictions is he talking about?\nWhat does it mean to say that either through poetry or polemics these\nauthors are \u201cmediating\u201d those contradictions? What does it mean to\nsay that the contradictions at issue have to do with \u201ccultural capital,\u201d\nrather than (say) an intellectual conundrum as old as the pre-Socratics\n(i.e., how can the fictiveness of  poetry be justified in a society that\nmakes a sharp distinction between the fictive and the real)? Matz re-\ncites the principles of  his analysis again and again and, in doing so,\nrepeats commonplaces culled from Pierre Bourdieu, on the one hand,\nand the past twenty years of  new historicist and Marxist literary criti-\ncism, on the other (as well as a good deal of  historical material from\nthe work of  Laurence Stone), even while also asserting that there is\nsomething highly original about his analysis. Indeed, Matz claims that\nBook Reviews 419\nhis analysis defies all new historicist thinking on the subject up to now;\nsuch thinking, Matz argues, has too comfortably identified with the\nliterary power of  the Tudor authors it ought to have been explaining.\nBut Matz never really establishes the terms of  his analysis either theo-\nretically or empirically and never brings to light the material struggles\nand contradictions to which the analysis is supposedly devoted. Matz\u2019s\narguments frequently depend on forced analogies, undemonstrated\nassertions, vague generalizations, misrepresented citations, and lin-\nguistic sleight of  hand. And they are expressed in an excruciatingly\nturgid prose. We thus get \u201cexplanatory\u201d statements like this one: \u201cBe-\ncause the rhetorics of  Sidney\u2019s Protestant moralism and feudal nos-\ntalgia are products of  his anxiety about courtly culture, rather than\nrepresentative of  that culture, these rhetorics can never be fully inte-\ngrated into the Defence\u201d (73). What\u2019s that?\nMatz\u2019s approach is often up to the task of  dealing with the straight-\nforward limitations of  Elyot\u2019s book. But Matz\u2019s foggy verbiage simply\ncannot accommodate those two masters of  indirect communication\nand analogical thinking, Sidney and Spenser. Matz doesn\u2019t seem to\nappreciate the difference between an analogy, a simile, a metaphor,\nan allegory, a homology, and a coincidence, not to mention between\nintended and unintended irony. But how are connections to be made\nbetween Sidney\u2019s self-deprecating jokes about Italians and his gallant\ndeath on the battlefield\u2014to the effect that both are to be seen as of  a\npiece with regard to Sidney\u2019s social anxieties\u2014if  the differences be-\ntween the things being connected are not first appreciated? Or how,\nto give another example, can claims be made about the latent content\nof  The Faerie Queene, as, for example, the claim that the Bower of  Bliss\nis a repository of  Spenser\u2019s \u201canti-courtly\u201d Protestantism, if  it is not\nfirst of  all acknowledged that Spenser is often slyly ironic in his use of\n\u201cdark conceits\u201d and frequently constructs homologies between phe-\nnomena that are only apparently the same? Matz does not seem to\nappreciate the idea, in the case of  Sidney, that the life may not always\nhold the key to the works, that discrepancies between words and works\nand deeds are the common coin of  both biographical and literary\nstudy. Nor, in the case of  Spenser, does Matz allow that if  the Bower\nof  Bliss in some way refers to courtly culture, it is not \u201cthe court\u201d tout\nsimple\u2014that Spenser is discussing a degenerate example of  what life at\ncourt can be so that Acrasia\u2019s government is at most a seductive trav-\nesty of  Elizabeth\u2019s, and cannot therefore be taken, tout court, as an\nexpression of  anticourtly sentiment.\nAnd there is a fundamental question to be asked of  the project.\nGranted, Tudor writers often had recourse to the Horatian terms of\n\u201cpleasure and profit.\u201d But isn\u2019t it fair to ask whether, in defending lit-\nM O D E R N  P H I L O L O G Y420\nerature in any epoch, under any cultural pressures, any other terms\ncould be used? When would one not say that poetry (or literary study)\nis worthwhile because it yields profit and pleasure? Under what cir-\ncumstances might one be able to establish that \u201cprofit and pleasure\u201d\nis particularly germane to a particular era? One might assert that a\nHoratian poetics is especially appropriate when some other form of\npoetics\u2014that (say) of  Plato, Aristotle, or Longinus\u2014seems less compel-\nling. In that case, one would need to make the argument that Tudor\nwriters embraced the Horatian model at the expense of  other models,\nfor reasons specific to Tudor discourse. But Matz does not make this\nargument; and in fact it can\u2019t be made. Elyot, Sidney, and Spenser\nwere as much Platonists as they were Horatians; their defenses of  lit-\nerature commonly appealed to the inventive and productive capacities\nof poetry and humanist study rather than to the benefits they yielded or\nthe sensibility they reproduced. \u201cOnly the poet,\u201d Sidney wrote, \u201clifted\nup with the vigor of  his own invention, doth grow in effect another Na-\nture.\u201d That is not Horace; the very notion would have made Horace\ngag. But Matz argues as if  the Platonic dimensions of  his authors\u2019\nthought simply weren\u2019t there; nor does he begin to address the issue\nthat Horace\u2019s Art of Poetry was far more influential in the seventeenth\nand eighteenth centuries than it ever was in the sixteenth century.\nMatz concludes his book with a discussion of  the failings of  new\nhistoricism (by which he means, predominantly, the work of  Richard\nHelgerson and Louis Montrose) so far as such work has argued that\nthe pleasures of  poetry in the Tudor era were politically significant.\nHe then proceeds to an excursus on the relevance of  Horatian cate-\ngories, as he has explained them, to the current crisis in the humani-\nties. Far from being a particularly apt figure for the sixteenth century,\nHorace turns out to be a man for all seasons; so much for historical\nspecificity. Matz wholly ignores the work of  a younger generation of\nnew historicists who have written on the Tudor defense of  poetry\u2014\nscholars like Frances Dolan, Mary Ellen Lamb, and Peter Herman\u2014\nand he draws scantly on the work of  older scholars. But he does wan-\nder into the domain of  contemporary cultural studies and the topic of\nthe corporatization of  the modern university. Few readers of  Modern\nPhilology, I think, will be illuminated by following him there.\nRobert Appelbaum\nUniversity of San Diego\nSHORT ONE LINE\n"}
