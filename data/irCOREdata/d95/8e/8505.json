Euler diagrams are an effective and intuitive way of repre-\nsenting relationships between sets. As the number of sets represented\ngrows, Euler diagrams can become \u2018cluttered\u2019 and lose some of their in-\ntuitive appeal. In this paper we consider various measures of \u2018clutter\u2019 for\nabstract Euler diagrams and show that they compare well with results\nobtained from an empirical study. We also show that all abstract Euler\ndiagrams can be constructed inductively by inserting a contour at a time\nand we relate this inductive description to the clutter metrics.\n1 Introduction\nEuler diagrams consist of contours (closed curves) which divide the plane into\nzones; they provide an effective and intuitive way of representing relationships\nbetween sets. Euler diagrams have numerous applications, including the visual-\nization of statistical data, displaying the results of database queries, represent-\ning non-hierarchical computer file systems and for viewing clusters which contain\nconcepts from multiple ontologies; closed curves are a basis for many of the UML\nnotations, including class diagrams and statecharts. However, as the number of\ncontours increases, Euler diagrams tend to become \u2018cluttered\u2019 and lose some of\ntheir appeal and effectiveness. An exploration of factors affecting clutter in Euler\ndiagrams was given in [7] and a clutter metric was proposed.\nVarious additions to the basic Euler diagram notation have been proposed\nwhich allow alternative representations of set relationships; for example, the use\nof shading to denote empty sets [6, 11] and the use of projections [4]. In [7], these\nare exploited to produce a \u2018clutter reduction algorithm\u2019 for these (extended)\nEuler diagrams. This can produce semantically equivalent Euler diagrams that\nare considerably less cluttered.\nThe clutter measure used in [7] appears to provide an effective measure of\nclutter. However, there are alternative measures that could be used and intuition\nvaries between individuals on the degree of clutter of various diagrams. In this\npaper, we present the results of an empirical study designed to test subjects\u2019\nnotion of clutter and consider comparisons between various clutter measures.\n? The first named author was partially supported by EPSRC studentship 0200109.\nWe also explore some of the properties of the measures in relation to diagrams\ncomprising more than one connected component, so-called \u2018nested diagrams\u2019 [2]\n(see section 2.3). We show that any abstract Euler diagram can be constructed\ninductively by adding a contour at a time. This leads to a deeper understanding\nof the behaviour of some clutter measures for nested diagrams.\nThe notion of clutter is an issue in many disciplines both within the area\nof visual display and beyond. We subscribe to the view that reducing clutter\nincreases the usability of diagrams [10]:\nIf we can better understand clutter, we can create tools to automatically\nidentify it, and even eventually create systems that will advise a designer\nwhen the level of clutter is too high, and suggest techniques for reducing\nvisual clutter.\nMetrics for measuring clutter are often specific to a particular domain. For\nexample, [12] measures clutter in aviation displays, [8, 9] for air traffic control\nand [1] for scatter plots. Our measures are no exception. However, we envisage\nthat aspects of this work will be adaptable to applications further afield; in\nparticular, the notion of separating clutter at the concrete and abstract levels.\nIn section 2 we review the (concrete and abstract) syntax of Euler diagrams\nand the notion of \u2018nesting\u2019. The clutter measure in [7] is introduced in section 3.\nWe then present the results of the empirical study which leads to the definition\nof two new clutter metrics. In section 4 we show that all Euler diagrams can be\nbuilt inductively a contour at a time and we relate this to our clutter metrics.\nWe also show how to calculate the clutter measures of nested diagrams. Finally,\nwe consider some directions for further work.\n2 Euler Diagram Syntax\nFollowing [5], we define two layers of Euler diagram syntax: an abstract or type\nsyntax and a concrete or token syntax. The concrete syntax describes drawn\ndiagrams (on paper or a monitor, for example) and the abstract syntax describes\nthe underlying structure of diagrams.\n2.1 Concrete Euler diagrams\nA concrete Euler diagram is a subset of the plane bounded by a boundary rect-\nangle and properly containing a number of contours, each with a distinct label.\nThere are various well-formedness conditions which are usually imposed to en-\nsure diagrams can be interpreted without ambiguity. We require that contours\nmeet transversely (cross one another at a point of intersection) and the diagram\nhas \u2018connected zones\u2019. Examples of non-well-formed Euler diagrams are given in\nfigure 1. The diagram d1 contains two contours B and C that do not intersect\ntransversely (they just touch at their point in common) whereas the diagram d2\nhas a disconnected zone (shaded).\nA CB\nd\n1\nA B\nd\n2\nC\nFig. 1. Non-well-formed Euler diagrams\nDefinition 1. A (well-formed) concrete Euler diagram is a quadruple d\u02c6 = \u3008L\u02c6(d\u02c6),\nC\u02c6(d\u02c6), Z\u02c6(d\u02c6), \u03b2\u02c6\u3009 defined as follows.\nThe diagram has a bounding rectangle, \u03b2\u02c6, whose interior contains a finite\nset, C\u02c6(d\u02c6), of contours (simple closed curves). Each contour has a unique label\nfrom the set L\u02c6(d\u02c6). Contours meet transversely and at most two contours meet at\nany one point.\nThe contours divide the interior of \u03b2\u02c6 into connected \u2018pieces\u2019 called zones;\nthe set of zones is Z\u02c6(d\u02c6). Each zone z\u02c6 is uniquely identified by a subset C\u02c6(z\u02c6) of\nthe contours: it comprises the region of the plane interior to the contours in the\nsubset C\u02c6(z\u02c6) and exterior to the contours not in the subset.\nThe last part of the definition of \u2018zone\u2019 prevent disconnected zones exhibited\nin diagram d2 of figure 1. This also ensures that each zone is described uniquely\nby a pair of sets (C\u02c6(z\u02c6), C\u02c6(d\u02c6)\u2212 C\u02c6(z\u02c6)) that partition C\u02c6(d\u02c6).\nExample 1. The concrete Euler diagram d\u02c6 represented in figure 2 has three con-\ntours a, b, c with labels A,B,C respectively. There are six zones which are de-\nscribed by the following pairs of sets that each partition C\u02c6(d\u02c6) = {a, b, c}:\n({a}, {b, c}), ({a, c}, {b}), ({a, b, c},\u2205), ({b, c}, {a}), ({c}, {a, b}), (\u2205, {a, b, c}).\nA\nC\nB\nd\u02c6\nFig. 2. An Euler diagram\n2.2 Abstract Euler diagrams\nAn abstract Euler diagram encapsulates the structure in a concrete Euler dia-\ngram but discards some topological details. It includes information about the\nway the contours interact (as specified by the zones) but \u2018loses\u2019 information\nabout the shape of the contours, for example. To describe abstractly the dia-\ngrammatic elements in a concrete diagram, we need to specify its contours and\nzones. Since only the labels of contours are needed to specify a zone, we can\nidentify contours and labels.\nDefinition 2. Let L be a set of contour labels. A zone (on L) is a pair (x, y)\nwhere x \u2286 L and y = L \u2212 x. The zone (x, y) is inside the contour labels in x\nand outside the contour labels in y. An abstract Euler diagram d with labels\nL is a pair d = \u3008L,Z\u3009 = \u3008L(d), Z(d)\u3009 where Z(d) is a non-empty set of zones\nsatisfying the following condition.\n(*) There is a zone inside every contour label: \u2200 l \u2208 L(d) \u2203 (x, y) \u2208 Z(d) : l \u2208 x.\nIt is common (see [2, 6] for example) to require the set of zones to satisfy the\nfollowing condition in addition to (*).\n(**) There is a zone outside all the contour labels: (\u2205, L(d)) \u2208 Z(d).\nThis condition is usually included as a \u2018drawability condition\u2019 since any\ndiagram that fails to satisfy (**) is not well-formed. At the abstract level,\nhowever, the condition appears somewhat arbitrary. For example, the diagram\nd = \u3008{A,B}, {({A}, {B}), ({B}, {A})}\u3009 does not satisfy (**) but there is no\nparticular reason why it should not be allowed as an abstract diagram.\n2.3 Nesting in Euler diagrams\nThe notion of nesting of Euler diagrams is defined in [2]. An Euler diagram d is\nnested if it can be constructed by embedding one diagram d2 into a zone z\u2217 of\nanother diagram d1. An example is shown in figure 3 where d2, with contours\nlabelled P and Q, is embedded in the zone ({A,C}, {B}) of the diagram d1,\nwith contours A, B and C.\nA CB\nd\nP\nQ\nFig. 3. A nested Euler diagram\nDefinition 3. An abstract Euler diagram d = \u3008L,Z\u3009 is nested if there exist\nEuler diagrams d1 = \u3008L1, Z1\u3009 and d2 = \u3008L2, Z2\u3009 and a zone z\u2217 = (x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2208 Z1\nsatisfying the following conditions.\n1. {L1, L2} is a partition of L.\n2. Z(d) = Z\u22171 \u222a Z\u22172 where Z\u22171 = {(x, y \u222a L2) : (x, y) \u2208 Z1} and Z\u22172 = {(x\u2217 \u222a\nx, y\u2217 \u222a y) : (x, y) \u2208 Z2}.\n3. Z\u22171 \u2229 Z\u22172 = {(x\u2217, y\u2217 \u222a L2)}.\nWe say that d2 is embedded in the zone z\u2217 of d1, and write d = d2\nz\u2217\u2212\u2192 d1. A\ndiagram that is not nested is called atomic.\nIt will be convenient to define the depth of z\u2217, depth(z\u2217), to be the number\nof contours enclosing it: depth(z\u2217) = |x\u2217|. The components of a diagram d are\nits atomic \u2018pieces\u2019 (obtained by successively decomposing as d2\nz\u2217\u2212\u2192 d1).\nExample 2. We shall describe the nested abstract Euler diagram illustrated in\nfigure 3. Let d1 and d2 be the diagrams defined as follows:\nd1 = \u3008L1, Z1\u3009 where L1 = {A,B,C} and\nZ1 = {({A}, {B,C}), ({A,C}, {B}), ({A,B,C},\u2205),\n({B,C}, {A}), ({C}, {A,B}), (\u2205, {A,B,C})};\nd2 = \u3008L2, Z2\u3009 where L2 = {P,Q} and\nZ2 = {({P}, {Q}), ({P,Q},\u2205), ({Q}, {P}), (\u2205, {P,Q})}.\nThe diagram d is formed by embedding the diagram d2 into the zone ({A,C}, {B})\nof d1, d = d2\n({A,C},{B})\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 d1.\n3 Measuring clutter\nSeveral factors contributing to the clutter of an Euler diagram were identified\nin [7]. These include the number of zones, the number of contours, the ratio of\nzones to contours within a component (connected \u2018piece\u2019 of the diagram), and\nthe degree of \u2018intersection\u2019 or \u2018disjointness\u2019 between pairs of contours \u2013 diagrams\nwhere most pairs of contours intersect tend to appear more cluttered than those\nwhere most pairs are disjoint. Various measures of clutter were considered in\n[7]. A preferred measure, called contour scoring, was proposed as a sufficiently\nsensitive measure of clutter which is straightforward to calculate. In this section,\nwe consider various \u2018clutter measures\u2019 and some of their properties and compare\nhow these measures perform relative to data obtained from an empirical study.\n3.1 Contour scoring\nIn a concrete Euler diagram, the contour score is calculated simply by counting\nthe number of zones within each contour and summing. In an abstract Euler\ndiagram, the contour score is the sum over the zones of the cardinalities of\ncontaining sets:\nCS(d) =\n\u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Z(d)\n|x|.\nThe diagrams d1, d2 and d3 in figure 4 have contour scores of 8, 14 and 28\nrespectively. Contour scoring is simple to compute and it is able to differenti-\nate between diagrams where some other measures fail. In figure 4, for example,\nCS(d1) 6= CS(d2), even though the number of zones (7), contours (4) and com-\nponents (2) are the same.\nIn section 4 we use contour scoring to define bounds on the clutter in a\ndiagram and we consider various patterns of diagrams and their contour scores.\nThe diagram d1 in figure 5 can be generalised into a pattern we call a \u2018chain\u2019,\nd 1 d 2 d 3\nFig. 4. Illustrating \u2018contour scoring\u2019.\ndisplaying a high degree of \u2018disjointness\u2019 between contours; chains have a contour\nscore which is a linear function of the number of contours. The diagram d2 in\nfigure 5 can be generalised into a pattern we call a \u2018crossed tunnel\u2019, displaying a\nhigher degree of \u2018intersection\u2019 between contours; crossed tunnels have a contour\nscore that is a quadratic function of the number of contours.\nd 1 d 2\nFig. 5. The \u2018chain\u2019 and \u2018crossed tunnel\u2019 component patterns on 5 contours.\n3.2 Empirical testing\nTo test whether contour scoring gives an accurate measure of clutter, an experi-\nment was conducted to compare people\u2019s intuition with the calculated measures.\nOver 230 experimental subjects, ranging in age from 12 to 40, were asked to score\nvarious Euler diagrams on a scale of 1 to 30 purely on the basis of how \u2018cluttered\u2019\nthey appeared. To ensure an intuitive response, subjects were given an appro-\npriately short time to complete the test. The experiment involved several sets of\ndiagrams to test various properties. Here we show the results of two tests, each\ninvolving 16 diagrams. Four (appropriately scaled) measures, introduced in [7],\nwere compared to the experimental data: Zones (the number of zones), Z:C (the\nratio of zones to contours), ZS (zone scoring, a measure calculated by summing\nthe vertex degrees of the simple geometric dual graph) and CS (contour scor-\ning). The results for one of the sets of 16 diagrams are illustrated in figure 6;\nthe results for the other set was similar. In each graph, the bold line represents\nthe data (the mean score for each diagram) and the dashed line represents the\nmeasure.\nEach measure appears quite accurate at measuring clutter scored by the\nsubjects. However, closer inspection suggests that contour scoring \u2018follows\u2019 the\nempirical data most closely. In [7], it was argued that contour scoring was able\nto detect subtle variations in clutter the other measures were not. For example,\nfigure 7 shows the diagrams in the experiment represented by the points 14 and\n15 (last but two and last but one) on the graphs. The data shows that d15 is\nperceived as being more cluttered than d14. Of the four measures, only CS scores\nd15 greater than d14; the other measures each score these diagrams equally.\nD i a g r a m s\nSc\nor\ne\n3 5\n3 0\n2 5\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n0\nD a t a  v s  Z o n e s\nD i a g r a m s\nSc\nor\ne\n3 0\n2 5\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n0\nD a t a  v s  Z : C\nD i a g r a m s\nSc\nor\ne\n2 5\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n0\nD a t a  v s  Z S\nD i a g r a m s\nSc\nor\ne\n3 0\n2 5\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n0\nD a t a  v s  C S\nFig. 6. Empirical data (in bold) compared to four measures (each dashed).\nd 1 4 d 1 5\nFig. 7. Diagrams 14 and 15 from the study.\nRank correlations support contour scoring as the most accurate of the four\nmeasures tested. For both sets of 16 diagrams used in the experiment, the Pear-\nson correlation between the data and CS was 0.889, compared to 0.721 for Zones,\n0.549 for ZS, and 0.451 for Z :C. These results are not intended as an in-depth\nstatistical analysis, but they do provide evidence of the capability of various\nmeasures to score clutter in Euler diagrams. A thorough analysis of results from\nthis large data set is intended for future publication.\n3.3 Alternative measures\nThe empirical data lends support to contour scoring as an accurate and reliable\nmeasure of clutter in Euler diagrams but it can give rise to some potentially\nundesirable results. Consider the (atomic) diagrams d1 and d2 in figure 8, which\nhave equal contour scores (given in the box in the diagram). Inserting a contour\ninto each diagram surrounding the given component produces diagrams d3 and d4\nwith different contour scores. In other words, the contour score does not preserve\nequality under the operation of \u2018enclosing a diagram with a new contour\u2019. The\nreason for this is the different numbers of zones in d1 and d2; see corollary 1\n(section 4.2). It is natural to ask whether this undermines CS as an measure\nfor clutter and whether we can adapt contour scoring to avoid this. We now\nconsider two possible variations on the contour scoring measure, each of which\nagrees with CS(d) for atomic diagrams d.\nd 3 d 4\nd 1 d 2\n1 6 1 6\n2 8 2 4\nFig. 8. Illustrating CS when enclosing a diagram with a new contour.\nSimple component contour scoring, denoted SCS(d), ignores nesting and\nsimply sums the contour scores of the components of d. In diagrams d1 and d2\nin figure 4 the components of the diagrams are identical and hence have the\nsame SCS score, even though the components are arranged differently. Simple\ncomponent contour scoring consistently scores nested diagrams lower that CS;\nsee theorem 4. Although SCS clearly preserves equality under the operation\nof \u2018enclosing a diagram with a contour\u2019, the diagrams in figure 9 illustrates a\nweakness in SCS. Here SCS(d1) is quite a lot bigger than SCS(d2) even though\nthe two diagrams are visually very similar. This example suggests that SCS may\nnot adequately represent the clutter in nested diagrams where one component\nis quite \u2018deeply embedded\u2019.\nd 1 d 2\n3 6 2 7\nFig. 9. Two similar diagrams scored differently under SCS.\nNested component contour scoring, denoted NCS, takes the sum of the\ncomponents\u2019 contour scores and adds the \u2018nesting depth\u2019 of each component; it\nrepresents a natural compromise between CS and SCS by taking account of the\ndepth of nesting at the component level. The diagram d2 in figure 9 has three\ncomponents with contour scores 25, 1 and 1. Their respective nesting depths are\n0, 4 and 5, giving NCS(d2) = 36. Whilst is is straightforward to compute NCS\nfor (simple) concrete diagrams, it is more difficult to formulate at the abstract\nlevel. Like CS, NCS fails to preserve equality under the operation of \u2018enclosing\na diagram with a contour\u2019 as figure 10 illustrates.\n3.4 Empirical testing revisited\nSince all three variations of contour scoring exhibit strengths and weaknesses,\nwe consider the empirical study to investigate how accurately the measures cor-\nd 3 d 4\nd 1 d 2\n9 9\n1 1 1 5\nFig. 10. Illustrating NCS when enclosing a diagram with a new contour.\nrespond to the experimental data. The study was carried out before these adap-\ntations to contour scoring were considered. Since the measures differ only on\nnested diagrams, we consider how they compare on the 14 nested diagrams from\nthe original 32 diagrams used in the study. The results are illustrated in fig-\nure 11, where again the experimental data is represented by bold lines and the\nmeasures by dashed lines.\nN e s t e d  d i a g r a m s\nS\nco\nre\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n D a t a  v s  C S\nN e s t e d  d i a g r a m s\nS\nco\nre\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n0\n D a t a  v s   S C S\nN e s t e d  d i a g r a m s\nS\nco\nre\n2 0\n1 5\n1 0\n5\n D a t a  v s   N C S\nFig. 11. Empirical data on nested diagrams compared to three measures.\nAll three measures perform well in relation to the data. The performance of\nsimple contour scoring warrants a particular mention; although it consistently\nscores diagrams lower than the other measures, its rank correlation with the data\nis 0.893 (as compared to 0.761 for CS and 0.707 for NCS). This is a surprisingly\ngood match since SCS ignores how components are nested in diagrams. These\nvalues may suggest that SCS more accurately represents the data when scoring\nnested diagrams. However when all 32 (nested and atomic) diagrams are consid-\nered, CS has a slightly higher correlation with the data scores than SCS (0.889\nand 0.857 respectively). As there is little difference in how well the measures\nrepresent the experimental data, which is adopted may depend on other factors\n(e.g., whether equality should be preserved under enclosing with a contour).\n4 Generating Euler Diagrams Inductively\nWe investigate the effect certain diagrammatic transformations have on clutter\nscores. We define a syntactic rule which can be used to generate any Euler\ndiagram inductively. This provides a framework to explore generic diagrammatic\npatterns and their clutter scores. We concentrate on CS but the process could\nbe adapted to the other measures.\n4.1 Inserting a contour\nWe describe how (abstract) Euler diagrams can be constructed inductively by\ninserting one contour at a time. To define the \u2018insert contour\u2019 rule, we need\nto specify how the inserted contour relates to each of the existing contours in\nthe diagram. We begin by considering its (one-sided) inverse operation, \u2018remove\ncontour\u2019, which is simpler to describe.\nRule 1 Remove contour. Let d = \u3008L(d), Z(d)\u3009 be an Euler diagram and let\nl \u2208 L(d). The diagram d with l deleted, d\u2032 = d\u2212 l, is defined by:\n1. L(d\u2032) = L(d)\u2212 {l}\n2. Z(d\u2032) = {(x\u2212 {l}, y \u2212 {l}) : (x, y) \u2208 Z(d)}. uunionsq\nIt is clear that d\u2212 l satisfies condition (*) of definition 2 and so is a well-defined\nEuler diagram.\nWe now define an operation which adds a new contour label l\u2032 to an abstract\nEuler diagram d. Various systems based on Euler diagrams have included an\n\u2018add contour\u2019 rule which preserves the semantic content of the diagram (see, for\nexample, [6]). The purpose of our \u2018insert contour\u2019 rule is different. We are not\ninterested here in reasoning with Euler diagrams but rather in building (abstract)\nEuler diagrams, so our \u2018insert contour\u2019 rule allows a contour to be inserted into\na diagram in any way that will create a well defined Euler diagram.\nConsider inserting a contour into a concrete Euler diagram. For each existing\nzone z in the diagram, the inserted contour will either entirely enclose z, or will\nsplit z in two or will be disjoint from z (strictly, the interior of the inserted\ncontour will be disjoint from z). For example, in figure 12, d\u2032 is obtained from\nd by inserting the contour labelled E. The inserted contour entirely encloses\nthe existing zones ({B,C}, {A}) and ({C}, {A,B}), it splits in two the zones\n({B}, {A,C}) and (\u2205, {A,B,C}) and it is disjoint from the zones ({A}, {B,C})\nand ({A,B}, {C}).\nIn an abstract diagram, to specify how a new contour label is inserted, we\nneed to \u2018partition\u2019 the set of zones into three subsets:\nZ1(d), the set of zones to be enclosed by the new contour label;\nZ2(d), the set of zones to be split by the new contour label;\nZ3(d), the set of zones that are to be \u2018disjoint\u2019 from the new contour label.\nA CB A CB\nE\nd\nd \u2032\nFig. 12. Inserting a contour\nIn general, one or more of the sets Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d) may be empty so\nthat, strictly, {Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d)} need not be a partition of Z(d). However, to\nmaintain condition (*) of definition 2, the new contour cannot be added entirely\noutside all the existing zones, so Z1(d) \u222a Z2(d) 6= \u2205.\nIn the example above, represented by figure 12, we have:\nZ1(d) = {({B,C}, {A}), ({C}, {A,B})}\nZ2(d) = {({B}, {A,C}), (\u2205, {A,B,C})}\nZ3(d) = {({A}, {B,C}), ({A,B}, {C})}.\nWe obtain the zones of d\u2032 as follows. Each zone (x, y) in Z1(d) gives rise\nto a single zone in d\u2032 by adding E to x, producing zones ({B,C,E}, {A}) and\n({C,E}, {A,B}). Each zone (x, y) in Z2(d) gives rise to a pair of zones in d\u2032\nby adding E to x and to y separately; this produces zones ({B,E}, {A,C}),\n({B}, {A,C,E}) and ({E}, {A,B,C}), (\u2205, {A,B,C,E}). Finally, each zone (x, y)\nin Z3(d) gives rise to a single zone in d\u2032 by adding E to y, producing zones\n({A}, {B,C,E}) and ({A,B}, {C,E}).\nRule 2 Insert contour.\nLet d be a unitary Euler diagram and let l \/\u2208 L(d) be a new contour label.\nLet {Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d)} be a \u2018partition\u2019 of Z(d) \u2013 one or more of the sets may\nbe empty but Z1(d) \u222a Z2(d) 6= \u2205. The diagram d with l inserted relative to the\npartition {Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d)} is d\u2032 where L(d\u2032) = L(d) \u222a {l} and the zones are\ndefined as follows.\n1. (x, y) \u2208 Z1(d)\u21d2 (x \u222a {l}, y) \u2208 Z(d\u2032).\n2. (x, y) \u2208 Z2(d)\u21d2 (x \u222a {l}, y), (x, y \u222a {l}) \u2208 Z(d\u2032).\n3. (x, y) \u2208 Z3(d)\u21d2 (x, y \u222a {l}) \u2208 Z(d\u2032). uunionsq\nLemma 1. Suppose the Euler diagram d2 is obtained from the Euler diagram\nd1 by removing contour label l; that is, d2 = d1\u2212 l. Then d1 can be obtained from\nd2 by inserting l.\nProof\nThe zones of d1 can be partitioned into three sets:\nZ1(d1) = {(x, y) \u2208 Z(d1) : l \u2208 x and (x\u2212 {l}, y \u222a {l}) \/\u2208 Z(d1)};\nZ2(d1) = {(x\u222a{l}, y) \u2208 Z(d1) : l \/\u2208 x\u222a y}\u222a{(x, y\u222a{l}) \u2208 Z(d1) : l \/\u2208 x\u222a y};\nZ3(d1) = {(x, y) \u2208 Z(d1) : l \u2208 y and (x \u222a {l}, y \u2212 {l}) \/\u2208 Z(d1)}.\nRemoving l from d1 gives the corresponding \u2018partition\u2019 of Z(d2):\nZ1(d2) = {(x\u2212 {l}, y) : (x, y) \u2208 Z1(d1)};\nZ2(d2) = {(x, y) : (x \u222a {l}, y), (x, y \u222a {l}) \u2208 Z2(d1)};\nZ3(d2) = {(x, y \u2212 {l}) : (x, y) \u2208 Z3(d1)}.\nIt is now clear that inserting the contour label l in d2 relative to this \u2018partition\u2019\n{Z1(d2), Z2(d2), Z3(d2)} recreates the Euler diagram d1. uunionsq\nThe following theorem follows by induction on the number of contour labels.\nTheorem 1. All abstract Euler diagrams can be generated from the trivial dia-\ngram \u3008\u2205, {(\u2205,\u2205)}\u3009 by applying rule 2. uunionsq\nExample 3. Let Tn denote the \u2018crossed tunnel\u2019 Euler diagram with n contours\n(n \u2265 2); T5 is shown as diagram d2 in figure 5. To be precise, let L(Tn) =\n{l\u2217, l1, l2, . . . , ln\u22121} where l\u2217 is the label of the contour that intersects all the\nother contours and suppose that l1, l2, . . . , ln\u22121 label the other contours from\n\u2018outside in\u2019 so that l1 contains l2 which contains l3 etc. To construct Tn+1 from\nTn, we add the contour label ln relative to the following partition of Z(Tn):\nZ1(Tn) = \u2205;\nZ2(Tn) = {({l1, l2, . . . , ln\u22121}, {l\u2217}), ({l\u2217, l1, l2, . . . , ln\u22121},\u2205)};\nZ3(Tn) = Z(Tn)\u2212 Z2(Tn).\n4.2 Using \u2018insert contour\u2019 to calculate contour score\nSuppose that the Euler diagram d\u2032 is obtained from d by inserting the contour\nlabel l relative to the \u2018partition\u2019 {Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d)} of Z(d). We aim to relate\nthe contour score of d, CS(d) to that for d\u2032, CS(d\u2032). For i = 1, 2, 3, let CSi(d)\ndenote the contribution to the contour score arising from Zi(d):\nCSi(d) =\n\u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Zi(d)\n|x|.\nThen CS(d) = CS1 + CS2 + CS3.\nThe contour label l is added to the containing set x of each zone (x, y) in\nZ1(d); since there are |Z1(d)| such zones, CS1(d\u2032) = CS1(d) + |Z1(d)|.\nEach zone (x, y) in Z2(d) gives rise to two zones in d\u2032, one of which has the\nadditional contour l added to its containing set x; since there are |Z2(d)| such\nzones, CS2(d\u2032) = 2CS2(d) + |Z2(d)|.\nFinally, each zone (x, y) in Z3(d) gives rise to a single zone in d\u2032 with the\nsame containing set x, so CS3(d\u2032) = CS3(d). Combining these equations gives\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let d\u2032 be obtained from d by inserting the contour label l relative\nto the \u2018partition\u2019 {Z1(d), Z2(d), Z3(d)} of Z(d). With the notation above,\nCS(d\u2032) = CS(d) + CS2(d) + |Z1(d)|+ |Z2(d)|.\nuunionsq\nCorollary 1. Let d be an abstract Euler diagram and let d\u2032 be obtained from d by\n\u2018enclosing\u2019 it with a new contour (see section 3.3). Then CS(d\u2032) = CS(d)+|Z(d)|.\nuunionsq\nFigure 13 shows various patterns of Euler diagram that can be generated\nby inserting one contour at a time. The figure shows a representative diagram\nfor each pattern with 5 contours, together with the contour score for a diagram\nwith n contours. In each case, the formula for CS(d) can be proved by a simple\ninduction argument using theorem 2.\nPolka dot: n Chain:  3 2n \u2212\nCrossed tunnel: n Inward chain: n\nTunnel: n n +( 1)\/2\nVenn: 2n\nn\u2212122\nFig. 13. Patterns of Euler diagrams and their contour scores\nThe \u2018polka dot\u2019 and Venn diagrams with n contours give the lower and upper\nbounds respectively on the contour score for a diagram with n contours.\nTheorem 3. Let d be an abstract Euler diagram with n contour labels. Then\nn \u2264 CS(d) \u2264 n2n\u22121. uunionsq\n4.3 Clutter in nested diagrams\nThe next theorem gives the contour score and its variations for a nested diagram;\npart 1 generalises corollary 1. The theorem relates to some of the properties of\nthe measures discussed in section 3.3.\nTheorem 4. Let d = d2\nz\u2217\u2212\u2192 d1 be an abstract Euler diagram obtained by em-\nbedding d2 in the zone z\u2217 = (x\u2217, y\u2217) of d1 as in definition 3. Then\n1. CS(d) = CS(d1) + CS(d2) + (|Z2| \u2212 1)depth(z\u2217).\n2. SCS(d) = SCS(d1) + SCS(d2).\n3. NCS(d) = NCS(d1) +NCS(d2) + depth(z\u2217), provided d2 is atomic.\nProof. In the notation of definition 3,\nCS(d) =\n\u2211\n(x,y)\u2208Z(d)\n|x|\n=\n\u2211\n(x,y\u222aL2)\u2208Z\u22171\n|x|+\n\u2211\n(x\u2217\u222ax,y\u2217\u222ay)\u2208Z\u22172\n|x\u2217 \u222a x| \u2212\n\u2211\n(x\u2217,y\u2217\u222aL2)\u2208Z\u22171\u2229Z\u22172\n|x\u2217|\n= CS(d1) +\n\u2211\n(x\u2217\u222ax,y\u2217\u222ay)\u2208Z\u22172\n|x|+\n\u2211\n(x\u2217\u222ax,y\u2217\u222ay)\u2208Z\u22172\n|x\u2217| \u2212 depth(z\u2217)\n= CS(d1) + CS(d2) + |Z2|depth(z\u2217)\u2212 depth(z\u2217).\nThe result in part 1 now follows. The proofs of parts 2 and 3 follow immediately\nfrom the definitions. uunionsq\nIn example 2 (figure 3), we have CS(d1) = 9, CS(d2) = 4, depth(z\u2217) = 2\nand |Z2| = 4. Hence CS(d) = 9 + 4 + 3 \u00d7 2 = 19, SCS(d) = 9 + 4 = 13 and\nNCS(d) = 9+ 4+ 2 = 15. These results are easily verified by direct calculation.\n5 Conclusion and Further Work\nThe empirical work and exploration of the properties of various clutter measures,\nconfirms the claim, made in [7], that contour scoring provides an effective mea-\nsure. Consideration of the properties of the contour score led to the definition\nof alternative measures (for nested diagrams). Further and more detailed statis-\ntical analysis of the experimental data is needed to confirm the initial findings\npresented in this paper. The experiment was designed and carried out before the\nadditional measures of simple component contour scoring and nested component\ncontour scoring were defined. A further study to explore subjects\u2019 scoring of the\nclutter of nested diagrams is desirable.\nIn attempting to understand the properties of clutter measures relating to\nnested diagrams, it was shown that all abstract Euler diagrams can be built\ninductively by inserting one contour at a time. This could produce an efficient\nmethod of generating a library of Euler diagrams. It is well known that not all\nconcrete diagrams can be built in this way. For example, the Venn-5 diagram\nin figure 13 has the property that removing any contour results in a non-well-\nformed Euler diagram with disconnected zones. There are, of course, concrete\nversions of Venn-5 which can be constructed by adding one contour at a time. It\nis an open question whether, given any drawable abstract Euler diagram, there\nexists a concrete instantiation that can be constructed one contour at a time.\nIn considering this question, describing a concrete version of our \u2018insert contour\u2019\nrule and exploring its properties will be important. For example, it is not clear\nunder what conditions a contour can be inserted into a concrete diagram to\nproduce a well-formed diagram.\nIn this paper we consider \u2018abstract clutter\u2019 \u2013 clutter arising from the structure\nof the diagram. However, it is clear that various aspects of the layout of concrete\ndiagrams can influence how cluttered it appears. Factors that appear to have an\neffect include the shape, size and relative positions of contours and whether there\nis symmetry in the diagram. Further experimental and theoretical work is needed\nto explore the factors affecting what we might call \u2018concrete clutter\u2019. This would\ninclude investigating various well-formedness conditions which provide different\nways of representing the same information content.\nAutomatic theorem proving algorithms based on Euler diagrams are being\nadapted to consider minimising the length of a proof [3]. An alternative or ad-\nditional criterion, designed to improve understandability, might be to use the\nmeasures to reduce clutter in proofs.\nThe ideas presented in this paper could have wider applicability beyond Euler\ndiagram systems. Reducing visual complexity whilst maintaining information\ncontent could be seen as a desirable goal for many diagrammatic systems. The\nidea suggested here \u2013 to separate \u2018structural\u2019 (abstract) from \u2018visual\u2019 (concrete)\nclutter \u2013 may prove a useful framework in fulfilling this goal.\nAcknowledgement.
