The aim of this study was to \ndetermine the incidence of PCD in a well defined highly consanguineous Asian population in the \nUK. \nOver a fifteen year period all patients suspected of PCD in the Asian population of Bradford, UK, \nwere tested by measurement of ciliary beat pattern, frequency and electron microscopy.  \nThe prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia in the population studied was 1 in 2265.  52% of the \npatients\u2019 parents were first cousins.  All patients had a history of chronic cough and nasal \nsymptoms from the first year of life. 73% had a history of neonatal respiratory distress. \nClinical suspicion of PCD should be high in populations where it is possible that high levels of \nconsanguinity may result in an increase in those with PCD.  In these communities the combination \nof chronic cough and nasal symptoms should prompt early diagnostic testing. \n3 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.  It is a \nserious condition where impaired mucociliary clearance is associated with recurrent chest \ninfections, leading to bronchiectasis.  Almost all patients have nasal symptoms, with either a runny \nor blocked nose.  Patients are frequently diagnosed after many years of chronic respiratory \nsymptoms with established and frequently significant lung disease.[1, 2]   \n \nPCD has an estimated prevalence of 1:15,000-1:30,000 live births although it is acknowledged that \nthis may be an underestimate.[1]  It is likely that due to lack of clinical suspicion and a lack of \nappropriate diagnostic facilities many patients remain undiagnosed. \n \nThe aim of this study was to determine the incidence of primary ciliary dyskinesia in the Asian, \nmainly Pakistani, population of Bradford, UK where a higher than expected number of patients \nwere diagnosed with PCD.  The ultrastructural phenotypes responsible for these defects are also \ndescribed. \n \nMETHODS \n \nOver a 15 year period patients suspected on clinical grounds of primary ciliary dyskinesia were \nreferred for diagnostic testing to the PCD diagnostic centre in Leicester, UK.  Basic demographics \nand age at diagnosis were recorded.  Details of when the diagnosis was first suspected were not \navailable. \n \nThe nasal brush biopsies were performed as previously described.[3]  Ciliated edges greater than \n50 m in length were observed at 37 C using an oil immersion x100 objective lens.  They were \nrecorded using a digital high-speed video camera (Kodak-Ektapro-Motion-Analyser, CA, USA) at a \nrate of 400 frames per second.  The ciliary beat frequency and ciliary beat pattern could then be \ndetermined directly.[3]  Brushings were fixed and prepared for transmission electron microscopy as \npreviously described.[3]   The microtubular and dynein arms of individual cilia from a minimum of \n15 cells (370 individual cilia) were examined.  The percentage of cilia with microtubular or dynein \narm defects was then calculated.  The criterion for a positive diagnosis was based on positive \nelectron microscopy findings. \n \nInformation on the number of South Asian patients in the Bradford area was obtained from the \nBradford and Airedale PCT and was based on analysis of patients registered with Bradford general \npractitioners. \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe total number of children with primary ciliary dyskinesia from Asian families living in Bradford, \n14 years or younger, was 19.  In total there are 43,049 children of Asian origin of 14 years or under \nin the Bradford area (females = 20,449; males = 22,600).  This gives a prevalence of primary ciliary \ndyskinesia in this community of 1 in 2265.  Ten of the patients\u2019 parents were known to be first \ncousins; one patient\u2019s parents were second cousins.  Eighteen of the patients\u2019 parents were from \nPakistan and one of the patient\u2019s parents was from Bangladesh.  No children were from ethnically \nmixed families. \n \nThe defects causing PCD included combined inner and outer dynein arm defects (n=13), central \nmicrotubular defects (n=3), inner dynein arm defects (n=1), radial spoke defects (n=1) and outer \ndynein arm defects (n=1).  Fourteen patients had a history of respiratory distress in the neonatal \nperiod and all had a chronic cough and nasal symptoms from their first year of life.  Two patients \nhad been diagnosed as asthmatic. The average age at diagnosis was 5.8 years (range: 1-12 \nyears).  In this study 10 out of the 19 patients with PCD had situs inversus. \n4 \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia in the Asian population of Bradford was high at 1 in \n2,265 and higher than any previous incidence of PCD reported.  Of interest only three children in \nthe same Asian population have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis compared to 19 with PCD.  \nThe vast majority of the Asian population in Bradford are of Pakistani origin and approximately \n55% of marriages in this population are between first cousins[4].  As inheritance of PCD is \npredominantly autosomal recessive, this is most likely due to the high incidence of consanguineous \nmarriages in this population.  Unfortunately we did not have a full data set to analyse the incidence \nof PCD in Caucasian patients from the same population. \n \nIt is likely that despite high local awareness of paediatricians to the presentation of PCD, a number \nof patients remain undiagnosed.  Although 50% of patients with PCD are thought to have situs \ninversus, we have noted that only 40% of patients diagnosed in our centre with PCD have situs \ninversus.  This may be explained by the maintenance of normal nodal ciliary function in the \ndeveloping embryo in patients with PCD secondary to central microtubular abnormalities.  Unlike \nrespiratory cilia, motile nodal cilia lack a central microtubular pair and beat in a circular fashion.  \nDisruption of this beat pattern occurs in most forms of PCD and appears to result in a 50% chance \nof situs inversus.  Although the cilia of PCD patients with central microtubular defects have a \ncircular beat pattern resulting in ineffective movement of mucus, these defects do not affect the \nmovement of nodal cilia during embryogenesis and normal situs solitus is maintained.[5]   In this \nstudy, 10 of our 19 patients had situs inversus, suggesting there may be an under diagnosis of \nPCD in the population.   \n \nEarly diagnosis is considered important, allowing appropriate respiratory management to hopefully \nprevent or at least to reduce the recurrent respiratory infections and subsequent bronchiectasis \nthat is commonly seen in this condition.[2, 6]  Worryingly, Noone and colleagues, from the USA, \nreported that 61% of children and 98% of adults with PCD had bronchiectasis and 27% of their \nadult patients had severe disease with an FEV1 less than or equal to 40% predicted. \n \nIn summary, the prevalence of PCD was found to be high in a predominantly Pakistani population \nwith a high incidence of consanguinity.  Clinical suspicion of PCD should be high in such  \npopulations. In these communities, chronic cough and nasal symptoms should prompt early \ndiagnostic testing, especially if there is a history of neonatal cough.\n5 \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
