(e.g.,\n[1]\u2013[3]), only in the last three years has\nthe field developed significant momen-\ntum, so much so that we can expect an explosion of\napplications and technical developments in the next\ndecade. Most promising are applica-\ntions in the fields of optical intercon-\nnects, low-cost telecommunications,\nand optical sensors, perhaps includ-\ning disposable biosensors. These\napplications have the common dri-\nving requirement of low cost. This requirement is likely\nto be satisfied in part by the leveraging of vast silicon\nmicroelectronics infrastructure, and hence, the involve-\nment of semiconductor manufacturers is the key to\nadvancement of low-cost silicon photonics.\nFurthermore, it underlines the likelihood that technolo-\ngy success will be based on a silicon plat-\nform, since this is simply the most well-under-\nstood and most studied material in modern tech-\nnological development. Consequently, prior to dis-\ncussing the advances in generic silicon photonic devices\nin detail, it is instructive to consider these three poten-\ntial application areas with the aim of putting the tech-\nnological developments discussed\nlater in this article into context.\nIn addition to cost, a major driver\nfor optical interconnects is increased\nbandwidth in a variety of applica-\ntion areas, including rack-to-rack\n(1\u2013100 m), board-to-board (\u223c50\u2013100 cm), chip-to-chip\n(\u223c1\u201350 cm) and even intrachip applications. This is\nbecause, even at small transmission distances, copper\ninterconnects become bandwidths limited above 10\nGHz due to frequency-dependent losses, such as skin\neffect and dielectric losses from the printed circuit\nBahram Jalali (jalali@ucla.edu) is with UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Furthermore, the situa-\ntion is expected to be exacerbated above 10 GHz by\nreflections and crosstalk effects [4, p. 115]. For intrachip\napplications, the limitations are also associated with the\ndimensional scaling of copper interconnects and the RC\ntime constant associated with the shrinking dimen-\nsions. Hence, there is an industry-wide desire to reduce\nresistivity and the dielectric constant within the inte-\ngrated circuit. These issues are compounded by the dif-\nficulty of realizing a suitable optical architecture for\nintrachip applications, although a range of architec-\ntures has been discussed (e.g., [5], [6]).\nConsequently, while intrachip interconnects remain\nthe biggest challenge, the other applications are current-\nly regarded as more viable, with a view generally taken\nthat copper interconnects will probably become viable\nfor bandwidths up to 20 GHz [7] as designers find inno-\nvative ways to extend the serviceable life of such com-\nponents. However, intrachip and other short-reach opti-\ncal interconnects can be regarded somewhat differently.\nSilicon photonics technology may first find applica-\ntions in fiber-optic communication. Applications are\nlikely to be focused in the low-cost, moderate perfor-\nmance parts of the network. These include areas in the\ndata center and enterprise as well as emerging optical\naccess networks. One notable emerging market is fiber\nto the premises (FTTP) in the United States or the\nequivalent fiber to the home (FTTH) in Europe. This\nemerging market is still subject to change in terms of\naccepted device and system protocols, although it is\nclear that the demand is set to be extremely high and\nthe market is to be large. Since the nature of the market\nis high volume and low cost, it is likely that low-cost\noptions will be essential, and hence, a mass-production\ntechnology such as silicon photonics, while immature,\ncould have significant impact is in this area.\nSilicon photonics could also play a key role in sens-\ning applications, notably biosensing. The mass produc-\ntion element of a silicon photonics sensor is clearly an\nattribute that would be attractive both to manufacturers\nand users of the technology. However, sensor applica-\ntions are somewhat different from the areas discussed\nabove, due to the plethora of very-low-cost passive opti-\ncal technologies that compete in this space. One likely\napplication area for silicon-based systems is the so-\ncalled lab-on-a-chip in which both reaction and analysis\ntake place in a single device. In the future, this could be\nextended to include electronic intelligence, a natural\nbenefit to the sensor application area from continuing\nadvances in the telecom and optical interconnect areas.\nJokerst et al. [9] have considered the integrated biosen-\nsor application areas in a host of material technologies.\nThey see silicon as a key material in this field but note\nthat the integration and miniaturization issues are the\nsecrets to the success. This is not surprising and is an\nissue that is strategic to all application areas. Therefore,\nthe realization of low-cost intelligent sensors in silicon\nphotonics technology is likely to follow the evolution of\nother application areas. Nevertheless, in the short term,\ncomponents of such systems will continue to evolve,\nnotably miniaturization of the sensing head itself. \nThe cost reduction can also benefit analog optical\nlinks and other microwave photonics systems. One of\nthe barriers against proliferation of microwave photon-\nics has been the high cost of components that meet the\ndemanding requirements of analog applications. Driven\nby the large dynamic range in microwave photonic sys-\ntems, components must exhibit low noise, high lineari-\nty, and high saturation power. Although silicon photon-\nics has enjoyed tremendous progress in the past five\nyears, it is still a nascent technology. In some cases, such\nas silicon photodetectors (PDs), research has a longer\nhistory, and the performance of these devices is\napproaching their III-V counterparts. In other cases such\nas modulator technology, it is less mature, and in the\ncase of the laser, an electrically pumped device is yet to\nbe demonstrated. The benchmark for silicon photonic\nresearchers has been III-V devices used in digital com-\nmunication. Consequently, even in the case of PDs,\nissues unique to microwave photonics, such as linearity\nand saturation power, have not been properly investi-\ngated. To be sure, as device performance continues to\nimprove, more attention to analog performance will\nundoubtedly be called for. In the meantime, passive sil-\nicon photonic devices may find applications in wide-\nband microwave signal processing. An example of the\nmicro ring resonator (RR), or micro-RR, is shown in\nFigure 1. These structures have passbands separated by\nthe free spectral range of the filter, the latter being\ndependent of the size of the ring. A microwave signal\nthat has been modulated onto an optical carrier can be\nfiltered with such devices. Current fabrication technolo-\ngy makes it possible to realize optical quality factors of\n105\u2212106, a range that corresponds to passbands of 2\u201320\nGHz at telecommunication wavelengths. Micro-RR can\nalso form cavities for silicon Raman lasers, as discussed\nlater in this article.\nLight Emission\nThe creation of silicon light emitters and lasers has often\nbeen considered as the holy grail of silicon photonics\nbecause of its potential payoff as well as the significant\nchallenge posed by nature. The challenge has to do with\nJune 2006 59\nFigure 1. A micro-RR. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:49 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n60 June 2006\nbulk crystalline silicon being an indirect bandgap mate-\nrial, which means that the upper and the lower electron-\nic states (conduction and valence bands) do not have the\nsame value of momentum (see Figure 2). Because the\nphoton of interest has negligible momentum compared\nto that of the electron, the electron-hole recombination\nneeds to be mediated by emitting or absorbing a phonon\nto conserve momentum. In the terminology of quantum\nmechanics, this is a second-order process, which implies\nthat, although not forbidden, the probability of occur-\nrence is extremely low. Such radiative recombination\nevents are rare, as characterized by a very long lifetime\non the order of 1 s. On the other hand, experimentally\nmeasured carrier lifetime in silicon is in the millisecond\nto microsecond range, depending on the impurity or\ndefect concentration. This suggests that radiative\nprocesses in silicon are insignificant, and experimentally\nobserved recombination occurs through impurities or\ndefects. Such processes are nonradiative, where the ener-\ngy is eventually dissipated as heat. A useful metric is the\nelectron-to-photon conversion efficiency given by the\nratio of nonradiative lifetime to total lifetime. This com-\nputes to an efficiency of 10\u22123\u201310\u22126 for bulk silicon. In\ncontrast, in a direct bandgap III-V semiconductor, where\nmomentum is readily conserved during recombination,\nthe radiative lifetime rate is orders of magnitude higher\nthan in silicon. The radiative process is so\nfast that, in a good-quality crystal, defect or\nimpurity-assisted nonradiative processes\ncannot compete with it. This leads to a con-\nversion efficiency that is close to unity for\nmaterial such as gallium arsenide (GaAs).\nWhile there have been numerous\napproaches aimed at overcoming or cir-\ncumventing this limitation, most belong\nto one of three main categories: \n\u25cf overcoming the indirect band struc-\nture by using spatial confinement of\nthe electron\n\u25cf introduction of rare earth impurities\nas optically active dopants\n\u25cf the use of Raman scattering to\nachieve optical gain. \nIn the following, we briefly review the\nsalient features of each approach, with the\nunderstanding that the length limitation\nof this article prevents us from citing most contribu-\ntions to the field. A more comprehensive review can be\nfound in [10].\nQuantum Confinement of Electrons\nThis concept exploits the fact that space and momentum\nvariables comprise a Fourier transform pair, similar to the\nrelationship between the frequency and time scale of\nmicrowave signals. When a conduction electron is free to\nroam the silicon crystal, its momentum is well defined.\nSpatial confinement of the electron within a silicon\nnanocrystal (NC) creates an ambiguity in the value of its\nmomentum, a phenomenon that is referred to as the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When the amount of\nthis momentum ambiguity approaches the initial momen-\ntum mismatch, momentum conservation is relaxed, and\nthe efficiency of light emission increases. A thin film of sil-\nica (SiO2) impregnated silicon NCs is the most common\napproach for confinement of electrons. In these structures,\nthe emission wavelength and efficiency depend on the\nsize of silicon NCs, which in turn is highly dependent on\nthe processing conditions. A typical spectrum is shown in\nFigure 3 (dotted curve) [11]. The emission wavelength is\nbelow the band edge of silicon, implying that the light\nFigure 3.

In a direct bandgap material, e.g. GaAs, electrons in the conduction\nband recombine with the holes in the valence band, transferring their energies to\nemitted photons. In an indirect bandgap material, e.g., silicon, the recombination\nis mediated by absorption or emission of a phonon.\nDirect Bandgap\nIII-V Semiconductor\nMomentum\nLight\n(Photon)\nLight\n(Photon)\nIndirect Bandgap\nSilicon\nPhonon-Mediated\nTransition\nPhonon\nAbsorption\nPhonon\nEmission\nEn\ner\ngy\nEr in Si nc\n6.5\u00d71020 Er\/cm3 + 900\u00b0C 1h\nSi nc without Er\nEr in SiO2\n488 nm 100 mW\n11 Hz\n\u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\n0.8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1.0 1.2\nWavelength (\u00b5m)\nPL\n \nIn\nte\nns\nity\n (A\nrb.\n U\nnit\ns)\n1.4 1.6\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Another lim-\nitation is that when the NC-embedded SiO2 is used as an\noptical waveguide, the propagation losses will be high\ndue to light scattering from the NCs, which have a much\nhigher refractive index (3.5) compared to the SiO2 host\n(1.5). This complicates the use of this technology in planar\nlightwave circuits. Furthermore, questions linger regard-\ning the reproducibility of material in which optical gain\nhas been observed. \nErbium Doping\nErbium (Er)-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers have\nbecome successful commercial technologies to the\nextent that such amplifiers are standard building blocks\nof fiber-optic networks. Rendering silicon optically\nactive by doping it with Er proved to be unsuccessful\ndue to the limited solid solubility and the competition\nfrom nonradiative processes, including back transfer of\nenergy from Er to silicon. Simply stated, it was found\nthat silicon is not a good host for Er ions. Since an opti-\ncal fiber is made from silica, a common material in sili-\ncon microelectronics, Er-doped silica waveguides have\nbeen the subject of extensive research. A typical lumi-\nnescence spectrum is shown in Figure 3 (dashed line),\nexhibiting emission centered in the 1.55-\u00b5m wavelength\nband (C-band) [11]. Corresponding to the low attenua-\ntion window of optical fibers, this is one of the most\nimportant wavelength bands for optical communica-\ntion. In addition, silicon is transparent in this wave-\nlength range; hence, such sources can be used along\nwith silicon waveguide modulators if the efficient cou-\npling of light from silica into silicon can be achieved.\nInterestingly, if Er is introduced in a silica waveguide\nthat also contains NCs of silicon, then the emission of Er\nis enhanced. This is shown by the solid line in Figure 3\nand is attributed to the sensitizing action of silicon NCs\n[11]. Absorbing the incident photon and thus becoming\nexcited, an NC that is in proximity of an Er ion transfers\nits energy to the ion, which will then return to its\nground state by emitting a photon. This fortuitous phe-\nnomenon holds promise for creating silicon-based light\nemitters and amplifiers that operate in the 1.55-\u00b5m\nwavelength band. In Figure 3, the satellite peak at\n1.1 \u00b5m is due to other transitions in the Er atom. \nAn apparent disadvantage of silica as a host for Er is\nthat, being an insulator, it cannot be electrically pumped\nusing an integrated diode. An innovative method being\nused to address this is by embedding the Er and NC\ncontaining silica within a metal oxide semiconductor\n(MOS) junction, where silica comprises the oxide region\n[11]. At sufficiently large voltage, electrons tunnel\nthrough the oxide and excite the NC. Silicon light-emit-\nting diodes (LEDs) have been demonstrated with this\ntechnique; however, lasing has not been achieved. The\ndevice reliability issue, caused by the presence of hot\nelectrons, has been a concern, although improvements\nare expected with further design refinement. Two\nimportant barriers exist on the path toward an injection-\ntype laser. The first is the free carrier losses in silicon\nNCs, a phenomenon that needs to be studied further.\nSecond, it is not clear if high enough current densities,\nsufficient for lasing, can be achieved in a MOS diode. \nRaman Scattering\nThe use of Raman scattering to overcome the indirect\nband structure of silicon was proposed in 2002 as an\nalternative to the approaches described above [12]. The\nadvantage of this technique is the ability to use pure sil-\nicon without the need for NCs or Er doping; therefore,\nit is fully compatible with silicon microelectronics man-\nufacturing. The traditional limitation of the Raman\napproach is that it cannot be electrically excited and\nrequires an off-chip pump. On the other hand, given the\nfact that the foremost problem facing the very-large-\nscale integration (VLSI) chips is power dissipation, hav-\ning the laser off-chip may be an advantage, since diode\nlasers and their driving circuitry are the main sources of\npower dissipation in an optical transmitter. Another\nadvantage of Raman devices is that although they are\noptically pumped, they can be modulated directly using\nan integrated diode. The mechanism of modulation\nhere is similar to those of silicon optical modulators\nwherein injected carriers modulate the optical absorp-\ntion of the silicon. Raman scattering in semiconductors\nis a purely quantum mechanical effect, and its explana-\ntion is beyond the scope of this article. Fortunately, there\nexists a much simpler macroscopic model that provides\nan intuitive picture of Raman scattering. In the sponta-\nneous scattering, thermal vibrations of lattice at fre-\nquency \u03c9v (15.6 THz in silicon) produce a sinusoidal\nmodulation of the optical susceptibility. The incident\npump field induces an electric polarization that is given\nby the product of the susceptibility and the incident\nfield. The beating of the incident field oscillation (\u03c9p)\nwith oscillation of the susceptibility (\u03c9v) produces\ninduced polarizations at the sum frequency, \u03c9p + \u03c9v\n(which is an anti-Stokes frequency), and at the differ-\nence frequency \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c9v (a Stokes frequency). In the\nstimulated scattering that is responsible for amplifica-\ntion and lasing, the interaction of the pump and Stokes\nwaves produces a driving force for atomic vibrations\nthat enhances the transfer of power from the pump to\nthe Stokes wave. In an amplifier, an incident beam is\namplified at the expense of the pump beam. In a laser,\nthe spontaneously generated Stokes photons are reso-\nnantly amplified inside a cavity and produce a strong\nbeam of light at the Stokes wavelength when the gain\nequals or exceeds the round-trip loss.\nThe Raman approach to silicon photonics has been\nextremely successful since its inception. It has recently\nproduced the first silicon lasers and optical amplifiers\n[13]\u2013[15]. The main contribution of the Raman\napproach in the near term will be optical amplification.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Consequently, silicon waveguides are\ncharacterized by losses in the range of 0.1\u20133 dB\/cm\ndepending on dimensions and processing conditions.\nThese, along with the fiber-to-waveguide coupling\nlosses, have limited the extent of on-chip integration\nthat can be achieved. With the ability to amplify the\nlight, many optical devices could be cascaded, bringing\nthe field closer to the vision of photonics circuits that\nboast a respectable level of complexity. \nSilicon-Based PDs and Next-Generation Devices\nPhotodetectors\nSilicon-based PDs are commonly used for applications\nthat operate in the visible spectrum (i.e., 0.4\u20130.7 \u00b5m)\ndue to their near-perfect efficiency at these visible\nwavelengths. However, most communication wave-\nlengths are centered in the near-infrared wavelengths\nof 1.31 and 1.55 \u00b5m, a region where silicon is a poor\ndetector. Figure 4 shows the experimentally deter-\nmined absorption coefficients for various bulk materi-\nals [16], [17]. Since silicon doesn\u2019t absorb well in the\nnear-IR range (i.e., 1.1\u20131.6 \u00b5m), typically indium GaAs\n(InGaAs)-based devices are preferred for communica-\ntion applications. To improve the performance of sili-\ncon-based detectors, the most common approach is to\nintroduce germanium (Ge) to the material system to\nreduce the bandgap. The effect on the absorption coef-\nficient and penetration depth, defined as the distance\nthat light travels before the intensity falls to 36% (1\/e),\nis also shown in Figure 4. Note that the data in Figure 4\nrepresents unstrained bulk material with no voltage\napplied. By introducing strain or electrical bias, it is\npossible to extend the curves to longer wavelengths.\nThis is very important for detection at 1.550 \u00b5m, where\neven a pure Ge film with the appropriate strain or bias\ncould potentially be shifted to reduce the penetration\ndepth to acceptable values.\nThere are various types of PDs, including p-i-n-based\ndevices and Schottky or metal-semiconductor-metal\n(MSM)-based detectors [17]. Both offer different perfor-\nmance tradeoffs and processing requirements that,\ndepending on the application, will determine the type\nof device that should be used. MSM-based devices,\nbecause of the metallization patterning, offer a more \nplanar-based design, which could lead to higher yield. In\naddition, MSM-based devices, due to the metal finger\nspacing being smaller than for a vertical p-i-n device,\nallows for much shorter transit times and thus much\nhigher bandwidths. However, the metal fingers of the\nMSM device often occupy 25\u201350% of the surface area,\nwhich leads to lower effective responsivity.\nThere are three key parameters for Ge on Si PDs.\nThey are the tradeoffs between dark current, band-\nwidth, and responsivity [18]\u2013[20].\nDark Current\nSilicon, due to its pure crystalline material quality and\nexcellent passivation properties, results in high-quality,\nvery-low-dark-current PD devices. However, the intro-\nduction of Ge with silicon will add some significant com-\nplications. Since the lattice constant of Ge is 4% larger\nthan that of Si, this lattice mismatch will introduce strain\nin the Ge film when it is grown epitaxially on Si. This\nstrain, when relaxed, will lead to misfit dislocations that\nin turn lead to threading dislocations (TDD) and will\ndegrade device performance.\nThis typically presents itself as\ndark current (noise) in the PD.\nFigure 5 is a schematic of how\nlattice mismatch between Ge\nand Si leads to misfit disloca-\ntions. In addition to strain, there\nexists no good passivation mate-\nrial, which further adds to the\nlikelihood of increased dark cur-\nrent.

Typical PDs do not have a deep extend-\ning electric field, so the carriers will slowly diffuse up,\ncausing a significant low-frequency component to the\nresponse. Key to detector design is to eliminate the\nslow diffusion current by using very thin films that can\nbe fully depleted to prevent the generation of diffusion\ncurrent or effectively reducing the diffusion length of\nminority carriers. This is often done by using a second\n(and deeper) p-n junction to pull out the slow carriers\nbefore they can reach the junction or by introducing\nrecombination sites near the depletion region to elimi-\nnate the slow carriers. The collection of the much faster\ndrift current is then optimized by keeping the depletion\nwidth as thin as possible, as determined by the pene-\ntration depth. If the penetration depth can be kept\nbelow 2 \u00b5m, the transit time alone could support a\nbandwidth of 10 Gb\/s or higher [21]. \nResponsivity\nThe responsivity is the ratio of collected photocurrent to\nthe optical power incident on the detector. Responsivities\nfor commercial III-V PDs are typically close to 0.8 to 0.95\nA\/W. Responsivity typically increases as the absorption\ncoefficient increases. Ge-based PDs can have responsivi-\nties as high as III-V PDs but usually at the expense of\nbandwidth and dark current performance. \nFor normal incidence PDs, the electrical and optical\nparameters are coupled. Maximizing the absorption by\nmaking the layers thicker results in a reduction in band-\nwidth due to transit time needed to travel through the\nabsorption material. If one produces a waveguide-based\nPD (see Figure 6), one can minimize the transit time but\nat the expense of lengthening the detector to increase the\nresponsivity. This inherently results in a larger capaci-\ntance device, which must be carefully optimized for\nbandwidth. However, the big advantage of the wave-\nguide-based approach is the fact that it is a planar\ndevice, so it is very suitable for integration with other\nphotonic devices in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform.\nIssues Related to Integration of Ge with Silicon\nThe amount of Ge required for efficient photodetection\nis dependent on the wavelength. If detection at 1.31 or\n1.55 \u00b5m is desired, then very high (>50%) Ge concen-\ntrations are needed. This concentration is significantly\nhigher than those found in SiGe heterojunction bipolar\ntransistors (HBTs), and as a result, new integration\nissues have to be overcome within the fab.\nChemical stability will be an issue for films with\nhigh Ge concentration. Since Ge does not form a stable\noxide like silicon when exposed to oxidizing chemicals,\nthe SiGe films tend to be susceptible to corrosion dur-\ning wafer cleaning and polishing. Thus, special pro-\ncessing modules will need to be developed to accom-\nmodate for the difference and maintain the integrity of\nthe SiGe films.\nFurthermore, since most useful strained Si1\u2212xGex\nfilms are metastable with respect to defect formation,\nexposing the wafer to high temperatures after growth\ncan be problematic. Certainly, long times at tempera-\ntures above the growth temperature (550\u2013650 \u00baC)\nshould be avoided. Higher temperatures might be pos-\nsible for short times, such as in rapid thermal anneal-\ning, but this is conditional on the film quality.\nAmorphorus, polycrystalline, or relaxed single-crystal\nfilms will not have this temperature limitation.\nA survey of the latest literature highlights the fact\nthat pushing performance in one parameter comes at\nthe expense of lower performance of the others. Jutzi et\nal. have shown very high B\/W in excess of 39 GHz but\nwith poor responsivity [20]. High responsivity can be\nachieved, but at the expense of bandwidth. For SiGe\ndetectors to be competitive, one must achieve band-\nwidths of 10 GHz or higher, a responsivity near 0.5\nA\/W, and dark current ideally below ~100 nA.\nAchieving all these performance requirements simul-\ntaneously will be a key challenge for the commercial\nviability of SiGe-based PDs.\nNext-Generation Devices\nWe now look ahead at two next-generation optical\ndevices in silicon, which focus on size reduction and\npossibly new functionality: RRs and photonic band gap\n(PBG) devices. Optical RRs are useful components for\nmultiplexing, switching, wavelength filtering, and\nmodulation. The key performance characteristics of the\nRR include the free-spectral range (FSR), the finesse (or\nQ factor), the resonance transmission, the extinction\nratio (ER), and polarization performance. Figure 7 is a\nsimple diagram explaining how a RR operates.\nFor such designs, resolution and optical lithograph-\nic critical dimension (CD) control are all important to\nthe success of the devices. In the case of Si-based RRs,\nFigure 6. Cross section of waveguide-based SiGe p-i-n PD. \nSilicon\np-Si\nSiGe\nn-Si\nI\nOxide\nSilicon\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply.\n64 June 2006\none of the critical parameters to control is the coupling\nefficiency between the RR and the input\/output wave-\nguide. As a compact waveguide (for example, 220 nm \u00d7\n500 nm strip waveguide) is usually used in the RR to\nobtain a large FSR, the gap between the ring and bus\nwaveguide is 100\u2013200 nm. Since the device operates\nthrough evanescent coupling, the coupling is exponen-\ntially dependent on the size of the separating gap. Thus,\nin order to reliably process high-Q RR devices, dimen-\nsional tolerance of a few nm demands CD control. This\nis readily achieved by modern 0.13- or 0.09-\u00b5m process-\nes currently in production. \nGoing to even smaller devices, one gets into a new\nregime. For example, photonic crystals are the optical\nanalog to electronic semiconductor crystals. Photonic\ncrystals have been gaining considerable attention since\nreports by researchers working in silicon were brought to\nmainstream attention. Their dispersive properties and\nnonlinear optical effects, combined with the promise to\ndrastically reduce the dimensions of common optical\ndesigns, are fueling many currently active research\nefforts, such as those on the super prism devices [22]\u2013[24]. \nThrough the periodic arrangement of two materials\nwith dissimilar dielectric constants, a photonic crystal\nwill exhibit a band of forbidden frequencies of propa-\ngation. This PBG is analogous to the forbidden energy\ngap of semiconductors, just as forbidden electronic\nstates are due to the periodic arrangement of atoms in a\ncrystalline lattice. The periodic arrangement of\ndielectrics on the order of the wavelength of light cre-\nates an optical gap (see Figure\n8). The most common example\nof a photonic crystal is a one-\ndimensional Bragg grating for\nwhich a forbidden optical gap\nor stop-band is achieved. For\nmost two-dimensional planar\nSOI-based PBG waveguides, a\ntriangular lattice of holes in sil-\nicon is used [25].\nCompared with standard\nwaveguide-based devices,\nPBG\u2019s benefits are that the\nphysics of operation allow for\nmuch smaller bending radii\nwith negligible loss. This could\nlead to very-small-form-factor\nphotonic devices. Smaller form\nfactors could lead to a much\nhigher level of integration on a\nsingle chip. However, all this\ncomes with increased coupling\nloss into and out of these very\nsmall devices. A conventional\noptical waveguide cannot have\na sharp bend without signifi-\ncant loss of power. PBG-based\nwaveguides can have 120\u00b0\nbends with radii near 1 \u00b5m [26].\nHowever, PBGs will require\nbetter processing and control of\nCDs. Another challenge of PBG-\nbased devices is the relatively\nhigh optical transmission losses.\nPhotonic crystal waveguides\ndevice performance has\nmarkedly improved in recent\nyears, as highlighted by the\nrecently announced propaga-\ntion losses of 3 dB\/mm in a\nwaveguide [27]. One of the key\ndevelopments in the field is the\nFigure 8.

As to functionality,\nthe control of the dispersive properties of a waveguide,\nsuch as group velocity dispersion and the group velocity\nitself, is a unique feature of photonic crystals, as recently\nhighlighted by the direct observation of ultraslow light\nin photonic crystal waveguides [29]. \nModulators \nBackground\nPhotonic modulation has traditionally been associated\nwith the Pockels effect in ferroelectric materials such as\nlithium niobate (LiNbO3) and III-V semiconductors, with\nthe former boasting a larger electro-optic coefficient [30].\nSilicon is inherently restricted as an optical modulation\nmaterial because the centrosymmetric crystal structure of\nsilicon means that it does not exhibit a linear electro-optic\n(Pockels) effect. This leaves the plasma dispersion effect\nand thermal modulation as the only viable mechanisms\n[31]. Thermal modulation is inherently slow, so the plas-\nma dispersion effect is favored for most applications. The\nplasma dispersion effect is related to the density of free\ncarriers in a semiconductor, which changes both the real\nand imaginary parts of the refractive index. \nStarting from the Drude-Lorenz model [32], Soref\nand Bennett [31] produced the following extremely use-\nful empirical expressions, which are now used almost\nuniversally to evaluate changes due to injection or\ndepletion of carriers in silicon. At an optical wavelength\nof \u03bb = 1.55 \u00b5m,\n\u0002n =\u0002ne + \u0002nh\n= \u2212\n[\n8.8 \u00d7 10\u221222\u0002Ne + 8.5 \u00d7 10\u221218(\u0002Nh)0.8\n]\n,\n(1)\n\u0002\u03b1 =\u0002\u03b1e + \u0002\u03b1h\n=8.5 \u00d7 10\u221218\u0002Ne + 6.0 \u00d7 10\u221218\u0002Nh, (2)\nwhere \u0002ne = change in refractive index resulting from\nchange in free electron carrier concentrations; \u0002nh =\nchange in refractive index resulting from change in free\nhole carrier concentrations; \u0002\u03b1e = change in absorp-\ntion resulting from change in free electron carrier \nconcentrations; and \u0002\u03b1h = change in absorption result-\ning from change in free hole carrier concentrations. \nAn interesting feature of the silicon electroabsorption\nmodulator that is central to microwave systems is the\ninherent linearity evident in (2). The absorption is direct-\nly proportional to electron and hole densities, which\nthemselves are linearly proportional to the device cur-\nrent. This results in an intrinsically linear static electro-\noptic transfer function, a welcome behavior in analog\napplications. However, one should be cognizant of the\nphase modulation, described by (1), which accompanies\nthe amplitude modulation. In optical links in which\nfiber dispersion is significant, dispersion-induced\nphase-to-amplitude conversion, an inherently nonlinear\nprocess, will be a source of dynamic nonlinearity.\nProgress in Silicon Modulators\nSilicon modulators and switches were among the first\nsilicon photonic devices to be studied and have been\nthe subject of extensive research ever since. While it is\nimpossible to provide comprehensive coverage of mod-\nulators here, several examples are discussed in the fol-\nlowing. A more comprehensive review of modulators\ncan be found in [33]. \nThe first plasma dispersion modulator in silicon was\nproposed by Soref et al. [34]. This p+ \u2212 n \u2212 n+ modula-\ntor was based on a single-mode silicon rib waveguide.\nIt was found by modeling that the interaction length of\nthe modulator required for a \u03c0 -radian phase shift was\nless than 1 mm. The corresponding loss was less than \n1 dB at \u03bb = 1.3 \u00b5m for both orthogonal polarization\nmodes. The buried block of SiO2 below the waveguide\nacts as the lower waveguide boundary. \nIn 1987, Lorenzo et al. [35] reported the first 2 \u00d7 2\nelectro-optical switch in silicon. The switch was fabri-\ncated as a vertical p+ \u2212 n diode. The injection of holes\ninto the intersection of the crossing waveguides\ncaused a change in refractive index, resulting in some\nlimited switching. For an input current density of\nJ = 1.26 kA\/cm2, applied at the p+n junction, the\ndevice experienced an on state that switched 50% of\nthe optical power from the output straight-through\nchannel port 3 to the output cross-channel port 4.\nAlthough this device was not optimized, it reaffirmed\nthe feasibility of the plasma dispersion effect.\nIn the late 1980s, Friedman et al. [36], [37] proposed\nand theoretically analyzed phase modulators in a series\nof transistor structures integrated into rib waveguides.\nThe devices were based around MOSFETs, utilizing\ninjection of single carrier types (holes or electrons) or\ndual injection field effect transistors (DIFET). The inject-\ned charge in the DIFET was to be controlled by the junc-\ntion field effect in which a voltage variable depletion\nwidth controlled the effective cross-sectional area of the\nconducting channel. The authors predicted effective\nrefractive index changes of the order of 1 \u00d7 10\u20133 for\napplied gate voltages of 10\u201320 V. They also proposed\ndual gate devices, which offered better overlap of the\nmodal field with injected carriers, although fabrication\nof two gates is impractical for potential SOI structures.\nThey concluded that because the refractive index\nchanges occurred over thin layers, the devices would be\noptimal in small waveguides, on the order of 0.1 \u00b5m in\nheight. At the time, this was regarded as unreasonably\nsmall, but as the recent trend to smaller cross-sectional\ndimensions continues, and nanophotonic devices are\nbecoming more seriously considered, some of these\nearly devices are being reconsidered. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply.\n66 June 2006\nThroughout the 1990s, significant progress was\nmade in the optimization of optical modulators, mostly\nbased on a progression to SOI waveguides, rather than\nsilicon on a doped silicon substrate.\nThe work of Tang et al. in 1994, in support of an ear-\nlier simulation paper in 1993 [38]\u2013[40], showed that it\nwas possible to obtain a 30% increase in the concentra-\ntion of injected carriers into the waveguiding region of a\nphase modulator by changing the sidewall angle of the\nrib from vertical to the naturally occurring 54.7\u00b0 (Figure\n9). Also, reducing device dimensions [41] and introduc-\ning trench isolation [42] were found to be the key means\nof increasing performance. In 2000, Dainesi et al. report-\ned a CMOS-compatible fully integrated Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer (MZI) in SOI technology [43]. A cross-fin-\nger type of p- and n-doping regions was used to modu-\nlate the optical phase through plasma dispersion effects. \nThe weak electro-optic effect in silicon requires long\ndevices and hinders high integration levels, increasing\nthe cost. Cavity enhancement of the effect can, in prin-\nciple, lead to efficient modulation [44]. The microcavity\nfacilitates confinement of the optical field in a small\nregion, and the transmission of the device near its reso-\nnance is highly sensitive to small index changes in the\ncavity. Barrios et al. [45] modeled a modulator based on\na Fabry-Perot resonator with Bragg reflectors. The\ndevice required a low concentration of injected carriers\nto switch to a nonresonant position. The 20-\u00b5m-long\ndevice was predicted to require a dc power of the order\nof 25 \u00b5W at an operating wavelength of 1.55 \u00b5m to\nachieve 31-MHz operating bandwidth with transmit-\ntance of 86% and a modulation depth of 80%.\nA similar device but using an RR (10 \u00b5m diameter)\nhas recently been demonstrated [46]. The highly scaled\ndevices used waveguides 450-nm wide and 250-nm\nhigh. Instead of electrical injection, free carriers were\nintroduced optically via two-photon absorption using\nultrashort pulses. The enhancement of the power in\nthe resonant structure reduces the power\nrequirement for switching. Modulation\ndepths up to 94% were measured with\nswitching times less than 500 ps, suggesting\na repetition rate of ~700 MHz. In general,\nresonator-based devices make use of high\noptical Q factors to enhance the interaction\nefficiency between free carriers and the opti-\ncal field. Fundamentally, this comes at the\nexpense of reduced bandwidth and in most\ncases, also results in polarization-dependent\nbehavior. Further enhancements were pro-\nduced by the same group in a subsequent\npaper [47].\nRecently, researchers from Intel\nCorporation experimentally demonstrated\na silicon-based optical modulator with a\nbandwidth that exceeds 1 GHz [48]. A\nschematic of the reported device, which\noperates via the plasma dis-\npersion effect, is shown in\nFigure 10 and bears a resem-\nblance to a CMOS transistor.\nThe device structure consists\nof n-type crystalline silicon\nwith an upper rib of p-type\npolysilicon. The n-type and p-\ntype regions are separated by\na thin insulating oxide layer.\nUpon application of a positive\nvoltage to the p-type polysili-\ncon, charge carriers accumu-\nlate at the oxide interface,\nchanging the refractive index\ndistribution in the device. This\nin turn induces a phase shift in\nthe optical wave propagating\nthrough the device. \nFigure 10.

The first technique was to\ndrive the device with a 0.18 Vrms sinusoidal source at\n1.558 \u00b5m, using lensed fibers for coupling into and out\nof the device. The second test was the application of a\n3.5-V digital pulse pattern with a dc bias of 3 V. A 1-\nGbit\/s pseudorandom bit sequence was applied to the\ndevice, and a high-bandwidth photoreceiver was used\nfor detecting the transmitted optical signal. However,\nthe on-chip loss for this device was high, at ~6.7 dB, and\nthe device is also highly polarization dependent due to\nthe horizontal gate oxide. Phase modulation efficiency\nfor TE polarization is larger than TM polarization by a\nfactor of seven. All measurements reported were made\nfor TE polarization. The authors subsequently improved\ntheir device by replacing the lost\/lossy polysilicon layer\nby crystalline silicon, by optimizing the doping, and by\nshrinking the device dimensions, resulting in a faster\ndevice [49]. This was demonstrated by implementing\ndata transmission at 6 Gb\/s (4.5 dB extinction ratio) and\n10 Gb\/s (3.8 dB extinction ratio). They also suggested\nthat by further optimization they could achieve extinc-\ntion >12 dB and chip loss of only 2 dB.  \nAnother recent paper has suggested that silicon\nmodulators are set to be pushed even faster. Gan et al.\nhave provided modeling of a small p-i-n device sug-\ngesting an intrinsic bandwidth in excess of 20 GHz\n[50]. This is achieved by using a combination of an\ninsulating layer and thin contacts to provide carrier\nconfinement. It is helpful to compare the recently\nreported modulators (Table 1) to see the trend to\nimproving device speed. This followed from model-\ning of Png et al. [51], which also suggested p-i-n mod-\nulators could be relatively fast.\nLuxtera Inc., a start-up company, recently also\nannounced a silicon modulator capable of operating at\n10 Gb\/s, although few details of the device have been\nmade available [52]. \nFinally, an interesting modulator has recently been\nreported by Boyraz et al. [13]. The Raman laser report-\ned by the same authors as the previous section was\ncombined with a p-i-n silicon modulator, which was\nused to inject free carriers to suppress lasing in the\ndevice, and hence, introduce modulation. A relatively\nlarge separation of the p\nand n regions of 8 \u00b5m\nwas used to perform the\nfunction, resulting in a\nmodulation bandwidth\nof only 1 MHz, although\nthe novel demonstration\nof a modulated silicon\nlaser was significant.\nThe CW laser reported\nby Rong et al. [53], and\nalso discussed previous-\nly, includes a p-i-n structure, this time in reverse bias to\nsuppress carriers. This device has been used to demon-\nstrate a lossless modulator by combining Raman ampli-\nfication with removal of free carriers.\nConclusions\nThe silicon chip has been the mainstay of the electronics\nindustry for the last 40 years and has revolutionized the\nway the world operates. Today, a silicon chip the size of\na fingernail contains nearly 1 billion transistors and has\nthe computing power that only a decade ago would\ntake up an entire room of servers. As the relentless pur-\nsuit of Moore\u2019s law continues, and Internet-based com-\nmunication continues to grow, the bandwidth demands\nneeded to feed these devices will continue to increase\nand push the limits of copper-based signaling technolo-\ngies. These signaling limitations will necessitate optical-\nbased solutions. However, any optical solution must be\nbased on low-cost technologies if it is to be applied to\nthe mass market. Silicon photonics, mainly based on\nSOI technology, has recently attracted a great deal of\nattention. Recent advances and breakthroughs in silicon\nphotonic device performance have shown that silicon\ncan be considered a material onto which one can build\noptical devices. While significant efforts are needed to\nimprove device performance and commercialize these\ntechnologies, progress is moving at a rapid rate. More\nresearch in the area of integration, both photonic and\nelectronic, is needed.\nThe future is looking bright. Silicon photonics could\nprovide low-cost opto-electronic solutions for applica-\ntions ranging from telecommunications down to chip-\nto-chip interconnects, as well as emerging areas such as\noptical sensing technology and biomedical applica-\ntions. The ability to utilize existing CMOS infrastruc-\nture and manufacture these silicon photonic devices in\nthe same facilities that today produce electronics could\nenable low-cost optical devices, and in the future, revo-\nlutionize optical communications.\nAcknowledgments\nBahram Jalali acknowledges Dr. Jag Shah of DARPA for\nsupport of his work.
