Nitrate availability in other natural environments, such as the oceans, on the other \nhand, is limited by a series of biological processes (12). Human dietary nitrate is absorbed into \nthe bloodstream from the stomach and small intestine, and then concentrated by a factor of 10 to \n20 by salivary glands (2, 5, 19, 24). Resultant salivary nitrate concentration ranges between 0.3 to \n2.6 mM depending on the diet (5, 19, 24). Salivary nitrate is dose dependent on dietary nitrate (5, \n19, 24) and more than eighty percent of dietary nitrate originates from fruits and vegetables (32). \nAs a result, humans with a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables may have a constant \nnitrate flow into the oral cavity and its concentration reaches up to more than three times higher \nthan that of the European drinking water standard (50 mg\/l)(31). Most mammals, including \nhumans, also synthesize nitrate (2, 6, 7). This indigenous nitrate arises from oxidation of nitric \noxide (NO), which is a signal molecule and links to numerous biological functions (9). Therefore, \neven with a nitrate-free diet, there will be significant nitrate concentrations in plasma (2). The \nphysiological function of active salivary nitrate excretion is as yet unknown.  \n \nNitrate is the next most favourable electron acceptor in the environment for micro-organisms \nconducting energy yielding metabolism when oxygen becomes limited and it is reduced into \ndifferent nitrogen species in the process (3, 10, 30, 33). This is crucial in the global nitrogen cycle, \nsuch as in the removal of nitrate in the marine ecosystem (12). The reduction of nitrate in \nanaerobic environments is dominated by two dissimilatory processes: respiratory denitrification \nand dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) (29, 30). Salivary nitrate is reduced to \n4 \n \n \nnitrite and nitrous oxide by oral micro-organisms in humans and animals (17, 19, 23, 28), \nindicating nitrate respiration is operating in the oral cavity. There have been concerns regarding \nthe harmful effect of salivary nitrite. For example, it has been associated with the formation of \nnitrosamines, known to be carcinogenic to animals (18, 20, 27). More recently, increasing \nevidence suggests that salivary nitrite has beneficial effects to the host, such as anti-microbial \nactivity, which can be enhanced under acidified conditions to prevent stomach and oral infections \n(19). \n \nWhen oxygen becomes limited, nitrate respiration takes precedence over the next energy-\ninefficient, fermentation process (10, 33). Some bacterial niches in human hosts, such as the \ninterior of dental plaques, are anaerobic (21, 22). Nitrate respiration in such niches is \nenergetically less favourable than aerobic respiration, but more favourable than fermentative \nbreakdown of carbohydrates. In fact, most bacteria which carry out DNRA, are also fermentative \n(29). For oral bacteria with both DNRA and fermentation metabolisms, the supply of nitrate in \nthe oral cavity may activate their nitrate respiration and repress fermentation and, as a result, \nbuffer salivary acidity. Repressing fermentation is not the only effect contributing to a saliva pH \nincrease due to nitrate respiration. Other mechanisms relating to nitrate reduction, such as \nhydroxyl ion generation (8, 26) and the scavenging of organic acid (3) may further contribute to \nthe reduction of oral acidity. Human saliva contains a high density of micro-organisms detached \nfrom oral biofilms (15, 16, 21, 22). When human saliva is incubated with glucose, the pH has \nbeen found to fall due to fermentative metabolism by salivary bacteria (15, 16). This has been \nused as a conventional approach to studying factors affecting oral pH and tooth decay. \n \n5 \n \n \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nSampling: A total of 13 volunteers (6 males, 7 females) were selected across the age span 20 to \n48. Saliva samples were collected by spitting saliva into 20-ml sterile plastic tubes without any \nstimulation. The total volume for each sample was between 8 to 10 ml. For experiments with no \npre-incubation, the sample tubes were placed in ice-water during collection. For other \nexperiments, samples were collected at room temperature (20\u00b1 3 \u00b0C). Samples were stored at 4-8 \n\u00b0C if not analysed immediately, but were never stored for more than 8 h. \n \nDegassing and pre-incubation: Equal volumes of Milli Q water were added to each saliva \nsample and mixed thoroughly to reduce viscosity. Aliquots (2 ml) of the diluted saliva samples \nwere then sub-sampled into six 40-ml, sterile, amber vials (triplicate for each treatment) with \npolypropylene hole caps, and sealed with PTFE\/silicone septa (Supelco 27121U). The samples \nwere then degassed with pure nitrogen through a sterile stainless needle (Fisher SZR-370-135X), \nwhich was pierced through the septum into the vial, and the tip submerged in the sample. Gas \noutlet during degassing was carried out via a sterile disposable syringe needle (TERUMO \n0411080). To stop contamination during degassing, nitrogen gas was passed through a 0.2 \u03bcm \nfilter. The degassing procedure was of 10 min duration, at a rate of approximately 200 ml min-1. \nAfter degassing, the samples were incubated at 30 \u00baC for 12 h where pre-incubation was applied. \n \nNitrate reduction assay: Glucose (BDH) and glucose plus nitrate \/nitrite (added as potassium \nnitrate (Sigma) or potassium nitrite (Fisher) respectively) substrate solutions were prepared in the \n6 \n \n \nsample vials as for the sample preparation from stock solution in Milli Q water. The pH of the \nsolution was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 2 M NaOH and\/HCl. The solutions were then \ndegassed as described previously.  \n \nSaliva samples and substrate solutions were both placed in a 37 \u00baC water for 5 min before starting \nthe reaction. The reactions were started by piercing the septa and injecting 3 ml aliquots of \nsubstrate solution into saliva sample vials to the final glucose concentration of 111.0 mM (2%) \nand nitrate\/nitrite of 1.5 mM. Aliquots (0.8 ml) were taken by piercing the septa using a 1 ml \nsterile, disposable syringe, needle at the time indicated. \n \nDetermination of pH and nitrate\/nitrite: Sample pH was measured in a 1 ml Eppendorf tube, \nusing a micro pH probe (VWR 6621767), attached to a pH meter (JENWAY 3305, UK). Nitrate \nand nitrite concentrations were determined using an ion chromatography system (Dionex, UK), \nwith conductivity detector and anion exchange column (AS9-HS). The mobile phase was 1.8 mM \nNaCO3 and 1.7 mM NaHCO3 in water, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. \n \nAeration: Where aeration was applied, a similar method was used as for degassing, but air \nreplaced nitrogen during incubation. The air was supplied by an air pump (Whisper 6000, UK) at \na rate of approximately 100 ml min-1. \n \nStatistical analysis: All statistical analysis was carried out using MINITAB-14 software. T-tests \nwere carried out using both the pH value at 3h and slopes of pH change between treatments \nduring incubation. \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults \npH fluctuation coupled with nitrate consumption. The pH fall decreased during incubation \nwith nitrate (1.5 mM) compared with controls (without nitrate) (P < 0.001, Paired T-Test, N = 13). \nA significant relative pH increase in the nitrate treatment compared to the control during \nincubation was observed (N=13, Figure1 (a)). There was a very strong negative correlation \nbetween the average nitrate concentration and average relative pH increase during incubation (R \n= -0.952, P = 0.012, N = 13. Figure 1 (b)). Figure 1 (c) represents an empirical Cumulative \nDistribution Function plot (CDF). It highlights the pH differences between the nitrate treatment \nand control (N=13) for all saliva samples and at all incubation times, indicating no pH difference \nfor pH 7 and above for both treatments, but suggesting pH was generaly lower in control than \nthat in the nitrate treatment during incubation. Approximately 22 percent of data points (N=195) \nwere less than pH 6 in the control, with only 15 percent of data points (N=195) less than pH 6 in \nthe nitrate treatment. There were 20 percent of data points less than pH 5.8 in the control, with \nthe same percentage of data less than pH 6.3 in the nitrate treatment.  \n \nThere were 4 volunteer\u2019s samples out of 13 in which pH fall was not reduced to a significant \nextent during incubation. Interestingly, nitrate was not consumed in a significant quantity during \nincubation for these four individuals (data not shown).  \n \n8 \n \n \npH fluctuation coupled with nitrite consumption. Nitrous oxide has been detected in human \nexhaled air (23). In this study, during the reduction of nitrate, the accumulation of nitrite did not \naccount for the loss of nitrate in terms of stoichiometry (data not shown), indicating nitrite is \nfurther reduced during microbial nitrate reduction. Indeed, when replacing nitrate with nitrite in a \nprimary experiment using three saliva samples, under the same conditions, the fall in salivary pH \ndeclined significantly in the present of nitrite. Figure 2 shows the relative pH increase and nitrite \nconcentration at 3h (N=3). There was no significant pH difference in one out of 3 samples in the \npresent of nitrite. However, in this experiment, nitrite was not consumed in significant quantities \n(data not shown). The remaining two samples demonstrated progressive consumption of nitrite, \nand the relative pH increase was coupled to nitrite consumption (data not shown).  \n \nFactors influencing nitrate consumption and pH fluctuation. When using saliva from one \nindividual, no reduced acidity was observed when nitrate was added and saliva was incubated \naerobically, without anaerobic pre-incubation, and there was no consumption of added nitrate. \nEven nitrate carried over from the original saliva samples, in the control experiment, was not \nconsumed in significant quantities (Figure 3 (a)). The reduced salivary acidity was also observed \nafter addition of nitrate to washed saliva pellets, during anaerobic incubation (Figure 3 (b))  \n \nDiscussion \nWhole human saliva usually contains 2.6 mM ammonium (11), which is higher than the \nconcentration required to suppress assimilatory nitrate reduction (29). This ensures salivary \nnitrate is used as an electron acceptor, to support anaerobic nitrate respiration in buffering \nsalivary pH, rather than consumed by assimilatory nitrate reduction by the oral microflora. The \n9 \n \n \nresults suggest that the function of active concentration and excretion of salivary nitrate by \nhumans and animals might have been selected to support anaerobic microbial nitrate respiration \nthat competes for carbon with processes that lead to fermentative acid production; the subsequent \nnitrate respiration generates hydroxyl ions and scavenges organic acids which have been \nproduced.  \n \nExperiments with saliva from one individual also supported the suggestion that  the consumption \nof nitrate is unlikely to have been due to assimilatory nitrate reduction as aeration inhibited \nnitrate consumption, and assimilatory nitrate reduction is not sensitive to oxygen (29). The \nwashed cell experiment demonstrated that the effect of nitrate on saliva pH is unlikely to be \nlinked chemically to the supernatant, and is more likely to be associated with the activity of \nmicrobial populations in the pellets. In figure 1 (c), differences are mainly apparent below pH 7. \nThe lack of difference above pH 7 between treatments is because data for pHs above 7 mainly \nreflect the initial incubation conditions (all saliva samples were initially above pH 7).  \n \nThe primary experiment showed nitrite also mediated the reduction in acidity during anaerobic \nincubation, suggesting nitrate was consumed via an anaerobic nitrate respiration pathway. \nHowever, the final reduction pathway needs to be further elucidated. Of course one could also \nexpect selective enrichment of denitrifiers (or nitrate-respiring bacteria) when nitrate is available \nand oxygen is limited (29). Salivary nitrate might have selected an anaerobic, nitrate-respiring \nmicrobial community to compete for carbon with obligate, fermentative bacteria. One of the \necological functions of dissimilatory nitrate reduction is to scavenge fermentative products, such \nas organic acids (3). Salivary nitrate may support the consumption of organic acids, which have \n10 \n \n \nalready been produced in the oral cavity, as electron donors through DNRA and the resultant pH \nincrease in the oral cavity. The reason for the lack of nitrate reduction in the four out of 13 saliva \nsamples might have been the lower microbial activity in saliva or individual differences in saliva \nmicroflora. This is not surprising since samples were collected without control, such as after \nbrushing of teeth, and prior to fluid or food consumption. The same reason might be responsible \nfor one individual result obtained in the experiment with nitrite, which did not indicate either \nnitrite reduction or acidity reduction. The reason for lack of nitrate\/nitrite reduction in these \nsamples should be explored in the future. The lack of acidity and nitrate\/nitrite reduction \ncapacities in all these experiments also supports the hypothesis that the slower pH decrease is \nlinked to microbial metabolism of nitrate or\/and nitrite.  \n \nIt is commonly believed that lactobacilli and streptococci are the main lactic acid producers \nresponsible for tooth decay (21, 22). Nitrate may not affect their metabolism as most of them do \nnot reduce nitrate. However, species of Actinomyces are common in human sub-gingival plaque \n(25), are the main nitrate reducers in the human oral cavity (4) and are carbohydrate fermenting \nbacteria (14). For these bacteria, suppression of acid production could be theoretically expected \nwhen nitrate is available.  \n \nIn the oral cavity, streptococci ferment carbohydrates to produce lactic acid, which is a principal \nfermentation substrate used by veillonellae (16). It has been shown that veillonellae from the \nhuman oral cavity can reduce nitrate (4). Lactic acid is also produced in the rumen (1). The \nimportance of lactate fermenting bacteria with nitrate reducing capacity in protecting lactate \naccumulation in rumen (referred to as lactic rumen acidosis) has been postulated. The mechanism \n11 \n \n \nis based on supplying nitrate to enhance the utilisation of lactate by the nitrate reducing \nSelenomonas ruminantium (1). In fact, lactate can stimulate nitrate and nitrite reduction to a \ngreater extent than glucose in these bacteria (13). It will be very interesting to investigate the \neffect of salivary nitrate on the metabolic communication between lactic acid producing \ncommunities and lactic acid utilising communities, such as occurs in the rumen. The mechanism \nof nitrate reduction related oral acid reduction should be further explored.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe are grateful to colleagues for voluntarily providing their saliva samples, to the Centre for \nEcology and Hydrology in Oxford for providing the funding and laboratory space, to M.

Fluctuations of salivary pH and nitrate concentration during anaerobic \nincubation.  \n \nFigure (a) shows relative pH increases in nitrate treatment during incubation (N = 13). The values \nof \u201crelative pH increase\u201d are calculated from the pH values in the nitrate treatment deducting the \npH values in control (without nitrate) for all experiments of 13 samples at different times. All \nsamples were pre-incubated and incubated anaerobically during the reaction. (b) Shows the \ncorrelation between average nitrate concentration and relative pH increase (N=13). (c) Shows the \nempirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots (N = 13, each line was plotted from 195 \npH data points). It calculates the proportion of data points less than each x  value (pH value), and \nthen plots the proportion (y value) as a function of x. The y-axis scale represents the percentage \nof data points less than each x (pH) value, not a probability scale for a specific distribution.

Effect of nitrite reduction on pH during anaerobic incubation \n \nAll conditions are the same as described in Figure 1, except nitrate was replaced by nitrite. Only \nrelative pH difference and nitrite concentration at 3h were plotted (N=3).   \n \nFigure 3. Effects of aeration and saliva supernatant on pH and nitrate consumption \nThe saliva incubation conditions were: (a) no pre-incubation and incubated aerobically; Saliva \nwas washed three times using 1x PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and re-suspended to the \noriginal volume. Other procedures were the same as described in methods except without pre-\nincubation (b). Each data point represents means from triplicate experiments from a volunteer\u2019s \nsaliva sample.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFigure 1 \n \na \n \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0 1 2 3 4\nTime (h)\nRe\nla\ntiv\ne \npH\n in\ncr\nea\nse\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nb \n \ny = -1.7545x + 1.373\nR2 = 0.9065\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\nRelative pH increase\nN\nitr\nat\ne \n(m\nM\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nc \n \n \n \npH\nP\ner\nce\nn\nt\n17 \n \n \n8.8.07.57.06.56.05.55.04.5 5\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nVariable\npH + nitrate\npH control\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5\nRelative pH\nincrease\nNitrite\nconcentration\npH\n\/N\nitr\nite\n (m\nM\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 \n \na.  \n \n4.5\n5.5\n6.5\n7.5\n8.5\n0 1 2 3 4\nTime (h)\npH\n0\n0.\n1\n1.\n2 \n \n5\n5\nN\nitr\nat\ne \n(m\nM\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nb. \n \n4.5\n5.5\n6.5\n7.5\n8.5\n0 1 2 3 4\nTime (h)\npH\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nNi\ntra\nte\n (m\nM\n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 .5\n5 .5\n6 .5\n7 .5\n8 .5\n0 2 4 6 8\nT im e  (h )\n0\n0 .5\n1\n1 .5\n2\npH + nitrate\npH control\nnitrate concentration in nitrate treatment\nnitrate concentration in control\n \n \n \n20 \n \n \n"}
