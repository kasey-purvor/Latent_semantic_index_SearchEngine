WSPs may be misconstrued as bureaucratic exercises in auditing unit 6 processes, as an imposed regulatory burden, or as \u2018another head office initiative\u2019. 7 Preventative risk management, by its very nature, should deliver fewer adverse 8 incidents, but because tangible operational evidence for this can be scare especially 9 when operations appear to be running normally, investment may be hard to justify. A 10 recent IWA survey (Zimmer & Hinkfuss, 2007) discusses a range of barriers that 11 prevented water suppliers implementing WSPs effectively, such as a lack of skills, 12 knowledge and finance, poor institutional arrangements, and uncertainty over how 13 best to implement them. This uncertainty may result in an unwillingness to invest in 14 WSP development. Reasons for this resistance (Zimmer & Hinkfuss, 2007) include: 15 \uf0b7 More work for staff. 16 \uf0b7 Competition with other projects. 17 \uf0b7 Resistance to change\/cultural barriers. 18 \uf0b7 Cost\/time constraints and, 19 \uf0b7 An absence of upfront investment, with a lack of demonstrable outcomes. 20 In response, the IWA is developing a toolbox of resources that will assist utilities in 21 overcoming these barriers and implementing the aims of the Bonn Charter, 22 specifically WSPs (Pollard et al, 2008b). 2310 Existing WSP Guidance 1 Rudimentary attempts have been made at guiding utility managers on the benefits of 2 WSPs. The WHO publication Water Safety Plans (Davison et al., 2005) offers some 3 arguments that senior managers may find attractive in the WSP concept, such as the 4 demonstration of best practice application, potential savings and improvements in 5 asset management. The guidance is concise and managers may require a more 6 developed rationale. A revised draft WSP manual acknowledges \u201cacquiring senior 7 management commitment may be achieved by providing clear and coherent 8 arguments about why the adoption of a WSP is important and advantageous to the 9 organization\u201d (WHO, 2008). The Australian guidelines for the management of 10 drinking water quality (NHMRC, 2004) suggest actions such as WSP policy 11 production, communication and engagement of stakeholders as demonstration of 12 commitment. Godfrey & Howard (2005) offer suggestions to those in developing 13 countries promoting benefits such as cost savings, the demonstration of best 14 practice, and quality assurance versus quality control. Helpfully, these authors offer 15 a decision tree for promoting the case for WSP development. One might argue, 16 however, that listing benefits such as cost savings first, though of added value, might 17 detract from the primary aim of WSPs, the protection of public health. 18 19 Notwithstanding the useful pointers above, there remains a lack of documented 20 evidence that describes what attributes and actions of leaders might instil the 21 enthusiasm and competency of their workforce and relevant stakeholders to be 22 mindful, and proactively manage risk. This raises a broader, and arguably, a more 23 fundamental issue of the differing motivations between the various stakeholders 24 associated with WSPs, and of those within any single stakeholder group. For 2511 example, in the context of low-income countries, public health and water quality are 1 often the main drivers of national Governments, public health professionals and 2 organisations such as the WHO. For donor organisations, water quantity is often 3 emphasised, especially in emergency and relief contexts: \u201cin the initial phase of a 4 disaster, quantity is more important than quality\u201d (Sphere, 2004). For implementers 5 of projects, completion within budget and time are often the main drivers. For the 6 collectors of water, invariably women and children, improved access is the primary 7 concern, whereas for men, water quality is paramount (Webster, 2006). Similar 8 differences occur within organisations in developed countries: the vision of public 9 health may originate with leaders, but managers are under pressure to deliver the 10 corporate vision to budget and time, and field implementers may be more concerned 11 with quality and service. The danger is that with these competing perspectives, the 12 rationale and vision for WSP implementation may get diffused. 13 14 Leadership and organisational culture 15 Setting the right tone at the top of an organisation has a marked influence on an 16 organisational culture of risk management. Tolbert & Zucker (1996) identify three 17 stages for the implementation of a new practice, for example WSPs: 18 1. \u2018Pre-institutionalisation\u2019, where there are few adopters and limited knowledge. 19 2. \u2018Semi-institutionalisation\u2019, where knowledge of the practice is widely diffused 20 but it has a short history and is not yet permanent, possibly with a \u2018fad\u2019 quality. 21 3. \u2018Full institutionalisation\u2019, where the practice is efficient and necessary. 22 One could argue that WSPs within the global water sector are in the semi- 23 institutionalisation stage (2). What happens during this stage determines whether 24 the practice becomes institutionalised, or forgotten as a \u2018fad\u2019. Tolbert & Zucker 2512 (1996) are clear that acceptance of a new practice as the norm is strongly affected 1 by the actions of management. 2 3","cites":null},{"id":37929937,"title":"Managerial commitment extends beyond the supply of resources. Leadership 4 influences the organisational culture of risk management. Schein","authors":[],"date":"2004","doi":null,"raw":"Managerial commitment extends beyond the supply of resources. Leadership 4 influences the organisational culture of risk management. Schein (2004) defined 5 organisational culture as \u201ca pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group 6 learned as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, that 7 has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new 8 members as the correct way you perceive, think, and feel in relation to those 9 problems\u201d. More simply, the attitudes, experiences, norms, beliefs and values of an 10 organisation. Webster (2006) emphasises the distinction between explicit and 11 implicit culture, and the need to move towards explicit culture with regards the 12 development of WSPs. Given the challenges of implementing any change within a 13 sector with skills shortages and the loss through retirements of corporate expertise, 14 the consideration of organisational culture is gaining attention among bodies seeking 15 to implement effective risk management (Pollard et al., 2008a; MacGillivray & 16 Pollard, 2008). 17 18 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) recently undertook a risk culture survey suspecting 19 that less than optimal cultures hinder a company\u2019s risk management practices 20 (PWC, 2003). The concern expressed is that any organisation can \u2018go through the 21 motions\u2019 of risk assessment, or by extension, produce a WSP, but to be truly 22 effective the whole organisation must be behind the implementation. PWC (2003) 23 identify key points that indicate cultural problems within an organisation: 2413 \uf0b7 A lack of awareness and understanding of business risks throughout the 1 enterprise. 2 \uf0b7 Business risks and control perspectives at the \u2018top\u2019 not linked to perspectives 3 of people on the \u2018front lines\u2019. 4 \uf0b7 An inability to operationalise risk management strategies through action plans 5 that align key business initiatives with systemic risks. 6 \uf0b7 Improper ethics and compliance practices. 7 \uf0b7 \u2018People strategy\u2019 not working well. 8 These problems are inherently linked to what management researchers refer to as 9 the \u2018tone at the top\u2019. To change cultural attitudes that have become embedded 10 within an organisation for many years is not easy, but organisations can make steps 11 to improve it through effective leadership (Schein, 2004). In his studies of culture 12 and organisational incidents, Reason (1998) argues that by changing aspects such 13 as the structures, practices, policies and procedures within an organisation, beliefs, 14 attitude and norms can be attuned. However, it should be noted here that is also a 15 reciprocal relationship between culture and social interaction (Webster, 2006). Much 16 can be learnt from the activities of high reliability organisations (HROs). HROs, such 17 as nuclear power plants, navy submarines and air traffic control centres have few 18 accidents (Roberts & Bea, 2001). Investigations into their management culture 19 reveal important insights for water utilities seeking to progress towards best practice 20 (Bradshaw & Pollard, in press). Leaders within HROs recognise that human error 21 occurs, but also that human variability and an ability to adapt to changing events is 22 an important safeguard. These organisations focus on systems at large, seeking to 23 remove error promoting properties through (Reason, 1998): 24 \uf0b7 Establishing of an effective reporting culture. 2514 \uf0b7 Analysing in detail the occurrence of incidents and close calls to uncover the 1 recurrent \u2018error traps\u2019; and 2 \uf0b7 Striving to imagine new scenarios that could occur and protect against these. 3 These features contribute to developing a \u2018mindful\u2019 organisation; one that has a 4 collective preoccupation with the possibility of failure and its root causes, has a 5 reluctance to oversimplify, is sensitive to operations, committed to resilience and 6 deferential to expertise (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006). Hrudey et al. (2006) developed 7 these ideas to suggest elements that water utilities may wish to consider when trying 8 to develop mindfulness: 9 \uf0b7 Informed vigilance actively promoted and rewarded. 10 \uf0b7 An understanding of the entire system, its challenges and limitations are 11 promoted and actively maintained. 12 \uf0b7 Effective, real-time treatment process control, based on understanding critical 13 capabilities and limitations of the technology, is the basic operating approach. 14 \uf0b7 Fail-safe multi-barriers are actively identified and maintained at a level 15 appropriate to the challenges facing the system. 16 \uf0b7 Close calls (near misses) are documented and used to train staff about how 17 the system responded under stress and to identify what measures are needed 18 to make such events less likely in the future. 19 \uf0b7 Operators, supervisors, lab personnel and management all understand that 20 they are entrusted with protecting the public\u2019s health and are committed to 21 honouring that responsibility above all else. 22 \uf0b7 Operational personnel are afforded the status, training and remuneration 23 commensurate with their responsibilities as guardians of the public\u2019s health. 24 \uf0b7 Response capability and communication are improved. 2515 \uf0b7 An overall continuous improvement, total quality management mentality 1 pervades the organisation. 2 3 Within strong cultures, members exhibit an alignment of organisational values; 4 whereas weak cultures show little alignment and control must be exercised. 5 However, it would be inappropriate to assume that \u2018one size fits all\u2019, and some 6 influences within an organisational culture have less impact on change than others 7 (Schein, 2004). Retaining a challenge function is also critical, for without it, a 8 reduced capacity for innovative thought, so called \u2018group-think\u2019 (Janis, 1971) might 9 develop. 10 11 In stressing the need for commitment, we do not suggest the sector is not committed 12 to public health protection; rather that it requires a renewed visibility. We seek to 13 avoid a \u2018badge on the wall\u2019 mentality for WSPs, which has been associated with the 14 inappropriate implementation of procedures such as HACCP and ISO 9001 for 15 example (Hamilton et al 2006). Kostova & Roth (2002) discuss the \u2018ceremonial 16 adoption\u2019 of a practice, which occurs where a practice is implemented but employees 17 do not believe in its true value, and thus results in a low level of \u2018internalisation\u2019. This 18 may occur where there are regulatory pressures to implement, yet the practice 19 appears contrary to the organisational beliefs and values; for example, where a 20 regulator stipulates that WSPs should be produced, yet the culture of the water 21 supplier is rooted in compliance testing alone. Internalisation is vital for staff, 22 because positive perceptions of improvement impact on implementation as well as 23 ensuring longer term institutionalisation (Kostova & Roth, 2002). It is here, in 2416 internalising WSPs within the organisation, where we believe managerial 1 commitment is vital. 2 3 We perceive two problems for utility managers seeking to secure executive support 4 for WSPs: (i) the lack of guidance on developing a compelling narrative that will 5 secure buy-in; and (ii) an absence of what true commitment looks like. Mahmud et 6 al. (2007) describe the successful implementation of WSPs in community-managed 7 supplies in Bangladesh; systems traditionally challenged by the use of untrained 8 community members to operate the water supply. The authors detail how the WSP 9 was developed, but less so on how commitment was generated. The first stage of 10 development was a conference where the discussions on the importance of WSPs 11 took place and this \u201cresulted in a firm commitment from all stakeholders to implement 12 WSPs in rural water supplies in Bangladesh\u201d. A number of questions arise: 13 \uf0b7 What were the important aspects of WSPs that generated this commitment? 14 \uf0b7 Who were the stakeholders involved? 15 \uf0b7 Were the community operators involved at this point? 16 \uf0b7 What constituted firm commitment? 17 Following success of a pilot project, evidence could be used to generate more 18 commitment using this example through regular interaction and sharing of 19 information between organisations undertaking WSPs in Bangladesh (Mahmud et 20 al., 2007). The draft WSP manual (WHO, 2008) includes a number of case studies, 21 one of which in Kampala Uganda, briefly mentions managerial commitment, sought 22 via an initial briefing with senior management to discuss the benefits of a WSP. 23 Again, detail on the mechanisms and demonstration of commitment is limited. 24 2517 These examples, both from developing countries, benefited from external funding 1 and\/or expertise in the form of research projects, and future commitment could have 2 been generated by the implementation phase. Commitment may not be so easy to 3 get in an organisation with little money, or prior to undertaking such a project. 4 Gregor (2007) comments on the importance of local commitment and buy in when 5 implementing WSPs in developing countries, where the driver comes from external 6 aid agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Commenting on WSP 7 implementation in the Pacific Islands, Gregor (2007) describes the aim enhancing 8 local capacity and involving governments in water safety planning so that when 9 external agencies leave, a legacy of local ownership and sustainability is secured. 10 Local commitment was developed through participative workshops, and one-on-one 11 training for water utilities with experts. Similarly, reflecting on the development of a 12 WSP in the Caribbean (personal communication), senior managers at the water 13 authority and key stakeholders were not engaged until the end of the process, which 14 then proved difficult. Had regular meetings with senior management been 15 incorporated, buy-in to the recommendations from the plan may have been easier to 16 secure. 17 18 From developed nations, there is limited reference to managerial commitment in the 19 case study literature. Mullenger et al (2002) describe the experience of South East 20 Water Limited, Australia, in implementing HACCP plans for drinking water. They 21 document a wide range of benefits for the organization, such as a greater 22 understanding of water quality issues, more streamlined work procedures and 23 improved customer responses, giving rise to a reduction in the number of complaints 24 received. Initial managerial commitment is not discussed, but it was noted that \u201cthe 2518 initial reaction of most staff to the implementation of HACCP was not favourable\u201d. 1 Although these attitudes changed towards the end of the project, little detail was 2 given on attempts to secure commitment at the outset, and the role that senior 3 managers played. 4 5 LESSONS FROM OTHER FIELDS 6 7","cites":null},{"id":37929935,"title":"Several Scottish towns issued with boil water notices following detection of cryptosporidium over summer months","authors":[],"date":"2007","doi":null,"raw":"Scotland Summer 2007 Several Scottish towns issued with boil water notices following detection of cryptosporidium over summer months Norfolk Jun 2007 6000 households told to boil water North Wales Nov 2005 231 cases of cryptosporidiosis. 70,000 homes told to boil water for 2 months. 11 129 MANAGERIAL COMMITMENT AND \u2018BUY-IN\u2019 1 2","cites":null},{"id":37929934,"title":"Table 2: Publicised Cryptosporidium incidents in the UK 2005-2008 (BBC,","authors":[],"date":"2009","doi":null,"raw":"Table 2: Publicised Cryptosporidium incidents in the UK 2005-2008 (BBC, 2009) 10 Location Date Details North Wales August 2008 45,000 people issued boil water notice following increase in Cryptosporidium Northampton June 2008 250,000 people issued boil water notice following contamination of water.

In 8 considering safety culture, Hopkins (2005) argues that creating the right mindset 9 among employees is ultimately an issue of managerial commitment. Woerner (1996) 10 also comments, &quot;Without true management commitment and visibility throughout the 11 operation, the safety program will never reach its greatest potential\u201d. Cooper (2006), 12 and Gyeke & Salminen (2007), demonstrated a close correlation in workplace safety 13 perception and the perceived support from management. Flin (2003) suggests once 14 managers are committed, they should regularly check this commitment is 15 communicated to their employees through surveys of perceptions and upward 16 appraisal; so-called \u2018climate surveys\u2019. Fernandez-Muniz et al. (2007) showed that 17 managers influence the safety culture of employees in two ways: indirectly through 18 support and funding for implementation and development of a safety management 19 system; and directly through positive attitudes and behaviours. They argue that 20 positive words in formal declarations are insufficient to modify employee behaviour, 21 and so managers must become personally involved in day to day actions in order to 22 demonstrate commitment and modify behaviours. Likewise Flin (2003) argues that 23 good safety management goes beyond knowing the \u2018safety script\u2019 and Hopkins 24 (2005) cautions that too often, leaders think that they can achieve safe operation by 2519 publicly stating that safety comes first, but then leaving it to others. This, he argues, 1 inadvertently conveys a message about priorities and he then summarises several 2 surveys which found that whilst senior managers considered they put safety first, 3 front line workers did not agree. Given these observations, we propose further 4 investigations into the communication of the basic business assumption of water 5 suppliers, both within the organisations and to external stakeholders. Cost-benefit 6 arguments and being able to demonstrate that best-practice is being undertaken 7 may be helpful in getting the \u2018go-ahead\u2019 for a project but may inadvertently, promote 8 a \u2018badge on the wall\u2019 mentality and foster complacency. Hrudey & Hrudey (2004) 9 observed,\u201dSo many outbreaks appear to have been caused by neglect or 10 complacency that is incompatible with recognizing safe, clean drinking water as a top 11 priority in life. No amount of economic rationalisation can make sense of providing 12 mediocre service to the public for something so vitally important\u201d. 13 14 WILL DEEPER COMMITMENT INFLUENCE UPTAKE OF WSPS? 15 16 We observe that commitment to public health appears infrequently within corporate 17 aims and objectives. During this review, 91 English language water supplier 18 websites from across the world were reviewed. Of these, 61 presented some form of 19 corporate statement (aims, objectives, visions and mission). Of these 61, 42 (69%) 20 included references to financial goals, 36 (59%) to environmental goals and 25 21 (41%) included reference to public health or safety of the water supplied. How 22 should these priorities be managed in concert to ensure water safety and good risk 23 governance? Roberts & Bea (2001) show that HROs balance long term safety with 24 short term financial goals and observe that \u201cwhen organisations focus on today\u2019s 2520 profits without consideration of tomorrow\u2019s problems, the likelihood of accidents 1 increases\u201d. Serious water quality incidents continue to occur. What is needed, we 2 believe, is a restatement (with evidence) of the commitment to protect public health 3 driven by the broader requirements of organisational reliability, rather than financial 4 efficiency \u2013 a refreshed set of basic business assumptions for the water sector. 5 6","cites":null}],"documentType":{"type":1}},"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","abstract":"Since publication of the 3rd Edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO)\nDrinking Water Quality guidelines, global uptake of water safety plans (WSPs)\nhas been gathering momentum.

Though related approaches, such as the hazard analysis and critical6\ncontrol points (HACCP) methodology (Deere & Davison, 1998; Gissurarson &7\nThoroddsson, 2000; Hellier, 2003) had previously been used, the revised WHO8\nguidelines for drinking water quality, the International Water Association\u2019s (IWA)9\nBonn Charter for safe drinking water, and before them, the Australian guidelines for10\ndrinking water quality, placed a renewed emphasis on preventative risk management11\n(WHO, 2004a; IWA, 2004; NHMRC, 2004). Such methods are rapidly being12\nimplemented across the globe (Table 1).13\nThere have been criticisms of using the HACCP approach for the supply of drinking14\nwater as discussed in Hamilton et al.\u2019s (2006) commentary on water safety initiatives15\nin the context of water utility risk management, mainly that:16\n\uf0b7 HACCP is concerned with hazards and not risk \u2013 there is no (semi)17\nquantitative analysis of the risk posed by each hazard.18\n\uf0b7 Transferring the Critical Control Point (CCP) aspect to water can be difficult \u201319\nwhat is critical?20\n\uf0b7 CCPs and critical limits can only be readily applied to the treatment process,21\nand not the raw water catchment and distribution system, making a source to22\ntap HACCP plan difficult.23\n\uf0b7 There is a risk of identifying hazards retrospectively to suit existing controls.24\n3\uf0b7 HACCP methodologies can become exercises in documentation rather than a1\nrisk management approach.2\nHowever, the HACCP approach is intended to be flexible, and integration with other3\nstandards such as ISO 9001 (2004) and AS\/NZS 4360 (AS\/NZS, 2004) can4\novercome these shortcomings. Hrudey & Hrudey (2004) recognised that the HACCP5\nprinciples can provide a useful foundation for a broader approach. Havelaar (1994)6\nidentified the limitations of HACCP for the whole supply chain due to a lack of direct7\ncontrol over source water catchments and at the customer tap, and argued that8\nsurveillance of steps in the abstraction of water, or in the distribution system for9\nexample is essential in defining critical limits for the true CCPs in the treatment10\nprocess.11\nThe objectives of a WSP are to prevent contamination of raw water sources, treat12\nwater to remove contamination and prevent re-contamination during storage13\ndistribution and handling. The primary aim is to protect public health through system14\nassessment, operational monitoring and management plans; guided by health-based15\ntargets and overseen by surveillance (Davison et al. 2005). One aspect that most16\nWSP guidance and case studies agree on is that \u2018buy-in\u2019 from across the lead17\norganisation, and particularly senior management, is imperative to successful18\nimplementation (WHO, 2004a; IWA, 2004; NHMRC, 2004; Godfrey & Howard,19\n2005).20\nA research interest in risk analysis tools and risk management frameworks within the21\nwater sector has been developed (MacGillivray et al., 2006; Pollard, 2008;22\nMacGillivray & Pollard, 2008). These are a necessary but insufficient basis, in23\nisolation, for improved vigilance on the ground. Our recent studies confirm that the24\n4organisational infrastructure of risk champions, risk management committees and1\nrisk registers is also insufficient unless embedded within a culture of sound2\norganisational risk governance. One utility manager noted (Pollard et al, 2007) \u201cI3\nthink that one of the main barriers is convincing senior managers \u2013 they have to buy4\ninto [preventative risk management]\u201d. In our experience, organisational commitment5\nto the safe drinking water agenda cannot be taken for granted as a priority. We6\nrecognise that utility managers manage several competing priorities. However,7\nwithout executive commitment, WSP development may inadvertently become a8\ntoken gesture and not fulfil its potential. Hellier (2003) noted, in describing the9\napplication of HACCP in a water company, that even the best management systems10\ndo not deliver safe water alone; well trained people committed to the protection of11\npublic health will always be essential. This paper considers why such commitment is12\nimportant; taking into account issues of leadership and organisational culture. We13\nexamine why buy-in is often so challenging and emphasise the importance of14\nleadership in public health to the delivery of preventative risk management. We15\nreconsider the fundamental aim of WSPs - the public health imperative - and how16\nthis responsibility is expressed in the basic business assumptions of water suppliers.17\nIn doing so, we reflect on other fields such as organisational health and safety. Our18\ncomments follow recent studies that have explored risk management maturity in19\nwater utilities (Dalgleish & Cooper, 2005; MacGillivray, 2006) and the concept of20\n\u2018mindfulness\u2019 within the water sector (Pollard et al. 2008a). Both we regard as21\nessential and are dependent on organisational commitment and effective utility22\nleadership.23\n5Table 1.

Millions more become ill through water-related diseases6\nsuch as hepatitis A, parasites, arsenic poisoning and fluorosis, some of which are life7\nthreatening (WHO, 2004b). Disease outbreaks are not restricted to less developed8\ncountries. Hrudey & Hrudey (2004) documented over 60 case studies of waterborne9\npathogen outbreaks in affluent nations from the last 30 years, analysing the causes10\nof these failures in order to draw out insights that might prevent future ones. They11\ncaution against viewing public health protection as equivalent to other business12\npriorities and offer guiding principles for the provision of safe drinking water13\ndeveloped from recurring themes from past outbreaks (Hrudey & Hrudey, 2004):14\n\uf0b7 Pathogens pose the greatest risk (pathogen removal and disinfection should15\nbe of paramount concern).16\n\uf0b7 Robust, effective multiple barriers to drinking water contamination are needed17\nbased on the contamination challenge to the raw water source.18\n\uf0b7 Trouble is preceded by change, so change should be taken as a warning.19\n\uf0b7 Operators must be capable and responsive.20\n\uf0b7 Drinking water professionals must be accountable to drinking water21\nconsumers.22\n\uf0b7 Ensuring safety is an exercise in risk management, requiring sensible23\ndecisions in the face of uncertainty.24\n8Whilst the WSP concept has been familiar for some years in high and middle income1\ncountries, WSPs per se are still not common, and in low income countries are rare.2\nMany water suppliers argue they have been managing risk in this way for years, yet3\noutbreaks and accidents continue in spite of reports identifying the reasons behind4\nsuch events. In the UK for example, we have witnessed a number of5\nCryptosporidium incidents, with boil notices issued (Table 2) despite6\nCryptosporidium risk assessments being a regulatory requirement since 1999 (DWI,7\n1999) and the active promotion of WSPs since 2004 (DWI, 2004).8\n9\nTable 2: Publicised Cryptosporidium incidents in the UK 2005-2008 (BBC, 2009)10\nLocation Date Details\nNorth Wales August 2008 45,000 people issued boil water notice following\nincrease in Cryptosporidium\nNorthampton June 2008 250,000 people issued boil water notice following\ncontamination of water.\nCatterick\nGarrison\nDec 2007 Boil water notice for military area and 2000 residential\nproperties following contamination.\nScotland Summer 2007 Several Scottish towns issued with boil water notices\nfollowing detection of cryptosporidium over summer\nmonths\nNorfolk Jun 2007 6000 households told to boil water\nNorth Wales Nov 2005 231 cases of cryptosporidiosis. 70,000 homes told to\nboil water for 2 months.\n11\n12\n9MANAGERIAL COMMITMENT AND \u2018BUY-IN\u20191\n2\nIn developed countries, WSPs assist in refining operating procedures, raising3\nawareness of the causal agents of waterborne disease, and establishing investment4\npriorities (Rouse, 2007); yet despite the benefits, organisational buy-in can be5\nelusive. WSPs may be misconstrued as bureaucratic exercises in auditing unit6\nprocesses, as an imposed regulatory burden, or as \u2018another head office initiative\u2019.7\nPreventative risk management, by its very nature, should deliver fewer adverse8\nincidents, but because tangible operational evidence for this can be scare especially9\nwhen operations appear to be running normally, investment may be hard to justify. A10\nrecent IWA survey (Zimmer & Hinkfuss, 2007) discusses a range of barriers that11\nprevented water suppliers implementing WSPs effectively, such as a lack of skills,12\nknowledge and finance, poor institutional arrangements, and uncertainty over how13\nbest to implement them. This uncertainty may result in an unwillingness to invest in14\nWSP development. Reasons for this resistance (Zimmer & Hinkfuss, 2007) include:15\n\uf0b7 More work for staff.16\n\uf0b7 Competition with other projects.17\n\uf0b7 Resistance to change\/cultural barriers.18\n\uf0b7 Cost\/time constraints and,19\n\uf0b7 An absence of upfront investment, with a lack of demonstrable outcomes.20\nIn response, the IWA is developing a toolbox of resources that will assist utilities in21\novercoming these barriers and implementing the aims of the Bonn Charter,22\nspecifically WSPs (Pollard et al, 2008b).23\n10\nExisting WSP Guidance1\nRudimentary attempts have been made at guiding utility managers on the benefits of2\nWSPs. The WHO publication Water Safety Plans (Davison et al., 2005) offers some3\narguments that senior managers may find attractive in the WSP concept, such as the4\ndemonstration of best practice application, potential savings and improvements in5\nasset management. The guidance is concise and managers may require a more6\ndeveloped rationale. A revised draft WSP manual acknowledges \u201cacquiring senior7\nmanagement commitment may be achieved by providing clear and coherent8\narguments about why the adoption of a WSP is important and advantageous to the9\norganization\u201d (WHO, 2008). The Australian guidelines for the management of10\ndrinking water quality (NHMRC, 2004) suggest actions such as WSP policy11\nproduction, communication and engagement of stakeholders as demonstration of12\ncommitment. Godfrey & Howard (2005) offer suggestions to those in developing13\ncountries promoting benefits such as cost savings, the demonstration of best14\npractice, and quality assurance versus quality control. Helpfully, these authors offer15\na decision tree for promoting the case for WSP development. One might argue,16\nhowever, that listing benefits such as cost savings first, though of added value, might17\ndetract from the primary aim of WSPs, the protection of public health.18\n19\nNotwithstanding the useful pointers above, there remains a lack of documented20\nevidence that describes what attributes and actions of leaders might instil the21\nenthusiasm and competency of their workforce and relevant stakeholders to be22\nmindful, and proactively manage risk. This raises a broader, and arguably, a more23\nfundamental issue of the differing motivations between the various stakeholders24\nassociated with WSPs, and of those within any single stakeholder group. For25\n11\nexample, in the context of low-income countries, public health and water quality are1\noften the main drivers of national Governments, public health professionals and2\norganisations such as the WHO. For donor organisations, water quantity is often3\nemphasised, especially in emergency and relief contexts: \u201cin the initial phase of a4\ndisaster, quantity is more important than quality\u201d (Sphere, 2004). For implementers5\nof projects, completion within budget and time are often the main drivers. For the6\ncollectors of water, invariably women and children, improved access is the primary7\nconcern, whereas for men, water quality is paramount (Webster, 2006). Similar8\ndifferences occur within organisations in developed countries: the vision of public9\nhealth may originate with leaders, but managers are under pressure to deliver the10\ncorporate vision to budget and time, and field implementers may be more concerned11\nwith quality and service. The danger is that with these competing perspectives, the12\nrationale and vision for WSP implementation may get diffused.13\n14\nLeadership and organisational culture15\nSetting the right tone at the top of an organisation has a marked influence on an16\norganisational culture of risk management. Tolbert & Zucker (1996) identify three17\nstages for the implementation of a new practice, for example WSPs:18\n1. \u2018Pre-institutionalisation\u2019, where there are few adopters and limited knowledge.19\n2. \u2018Semi-institutionalisation\u2019, where knowledge of the practice is widely diffused20\nbut it has a short history and is not yet permanent, possibly with a \u2018fad\u2019 quality.21\n3. \u2018Full institutionalisation\u2019, where the practice is efficient and necessary.22\nOne could argue that WSPs within the global water sector are in the semi-23\ninstitutionalisation stage (2). What happens during this stage determines whether24\nthe practice becomes institutionalised, or forgotten as a \u2018fad\u2019. Tolbert & Zucker25\n12\n(1996) are clear that acceptance of a new practice as the norm is strongly affected1\nby the actions of management.2\n3\nManagerial commitment extends beyond the supply of resources. Leadership4\ninfluences the organisational culture of risk management. Schein (2004) defined5\norganisational culture as \u201ca pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group6\nlearned as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, that7\nhas worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new8\nmembers as the correct way you perceive, think, and feel in relation to those9\nproblems\u201d. More simply, the attitudes, experiences, norms, beliefs and values of an10\norganisation. Webster (2006) emphasises the distinction between explicit and11\nimplicit culture, and the need to move towards explicit culture with regards the12\ndevelopment of WSPs. Given the challenges of implementing any change within a13\nsector with skills shortages and the loss through retirements of corporate expertise,14\nthe consideration of organisational culture is gaining attention among bodies seeking15\nto implement effective risk management (Pollard et al., 2008a; MacGillivray &16\nPollard, 2008).17\n18\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) recently undertook a risk culture survey suspecting19\nthat less than optimal cultures hinder a company\u2019s risk management practices20\n(PWC, 2003). The concern expressed is that any organisation can \u2018go through the21\nmotions\u2019 of risk assessment, or by extension, produce a WSP, but to be truly22\neffective the whole organisation must be behind the implementation. PWC (2003)23\nidentify key points that indicate cultural problems within an organisation:24\n13\n\uf0b7 A lack of awareness and understanding of business risks throughout the1\nenterprise.2\n\uf0b7 Business risks and control perspectives at the \u2018top\u2019 not linked to perspectives3\nof people on the \u2018front lines\u2019.4\n\uf0b7 An inability to operationalise risk management strategies through action plans5\nthat align key business initiatives with systemic risks.6\n\uf0b7 Improper ethics and compliance practices.7\n\uf0b7 \u2018People strategy\u2019 not working well.8\nThese problems are inherently linked to what management researchers refer to as9\nthe \u2018tone at the top\u2019. To change cultural attitudes that have become embedded10\nwithin an organisation for many years is not easy, but organisations can make steps11\nto improve it through effective leadership (Schein, 2004). In his studies of culture12\nand organisational incidents, Reason (1998) argues that by changing aspects such13\nas the structures, practices, policies and procedures within an organisation, beliefs,14\nattitude and norms can be attuned. However, it should be noted here that is also a15\nreciprocal relationship between culture and social interaction (Webster, 2006). Much16\ncan be learnt from the activities of high reliability organisations (HROs). HROs, such17\nas nuclear power plants, navy submarines and air traffic control centres have few18\naccidents (Roberts & Bea, 2001). Investigations into their management culture19\nreveal important insights for water utilities seeking to progress towards best practice20\n(Bradshaw & Pollard, in press). Leaders within HROs recognise that human error21\noccurs, but also that human variability and an ability to adapt to changing events is22\nan important safeguard. These organisations focus on systems at large, seeking to23\nremove error promoting properties through (Reason, 1998):24\n\uf0b7 Establishing of an effective reporting culture.25\n14\n\uf0b7 Analysing in detail the occurrence of incidents and close calls to uncover the1\nrecurrent \u2018error traps\u2019; and2\n\uf0b7 Striving to imagine new scenarios that could occur and protect against these.3\nThese features contribute to developing a \u2018mindful\u2019 organisation; one that has a4\ncollective preoccupation with the possibility of failure and its root causes, has a5\nreluctance to oversimplify, is sensitive to operations, committed to resilience and6\ndeferential to expertise (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006). Hrudey et al. (2006) developed7\nthese ideas to suggest elements that water utilities may wish to consider when trying8\nto develop mindfulness:9\n\uf0b7 Informed vigilance actively promoted and rewarded.10\n\uf0b7 An understanding of the entire system, its challenges and limitations are11\npromoted and actively maintained.12\n\uf0b7 Effective, real-time treatment process control, based on understanding critical13\ncapabilities and limitations of the technology, is the basic operating approach.14\n\uf0b7 Fail-safe multi-barriers are actively identified and maintained at a level15\nappropriate to the challenges facing the system.16\n\uf0b7 Close calls (near misses) are documented and used to train staff about how17\nthe system responded under stress and to identify what measures are needed18\nto make such events less likely in the future.19\n\uf0b7 Operators, supervisors, lab personnel and management all understand that20\nthey are entrusted with protecting the public\u2019s health and are committed to21\nhonouring that responsibility above all else.22\n\uf0b7 Operational personnel are afforded the status, training and remuneration23\ncommensurate with their responsibilities as guardians of the public\u2019s health.24\n\uf0b7 Response capability and communication are improved.25\n15\n\uf0b7 An overall continuous improvement, total quality management mentality1\npervades the organisation.2\n3\nWithin strong cultures, members exhibit an alignment of organisational values;4\nwhereas weak cultures show little alignment and control must be exercised.5\nHowever, it would be inappropriate to assume that \u2018one size fits all\u2019, and some6\ninfluences within an organisational culture have less impact on change than others7\n(Schein, 2004). Retaining a challenge function is also critical, for without it, a8\nreduced capacity for innovative thought, so called \u2018group-think\u2019 (Janis, 1971) might9\ndevelop.10\n11\nIn stressing the need for commitment, we do not suggest the sector is not committed12\nto public health protection; rather that it requires a renewed visibility. We seek to13\navoid a \u2018badge on the wall\u2019 mentality for WSPs, which has been associated with the14\ninappropriate implementation of procedures such as HACCP and ISO 9001 for15\nexample (Hamilton et al 2006). Kostova & Roth (2002) discuss the \u2018ceremonial16\nadoption\u2019 of a practice, which occurs where a practice is implemented but employees17\ndo not believe in its true value, and thus results in a low level of \u2018internalisation\u2019. This18\nmay occur where there are regulatory pressures to implement, yet the practice19\nappears contrary to the organisational beliefs and values; for example, where a20\nregulator stipulates that WSPs should be produced, yet the culture of the water21\nsupplier is rooted in compliance testing alone. Internalisation is vital for staff,22\nbecause positive perceptions of improvement impact on implementation as well as23\nensuring longer term institutionalisation (Kostova & Roth, 2002). It is here, in24\n16\ninternalising WSPs within the organisation, where we believe managerial1\ncommitment is vital.2\n3\nWe perceive two problems for utility managers seeking to secure executive support4\nfor WSPs: (i) the lack of guidance on developing a compelling narrative that will5\nsecure buy-in; and (ii) an absence of what true commitment looks like. Mahmud et6\nal. (2007) describe the successful implementation of WSPs in community-managed7\nsupplies in Bangladesh; systems traditionally challenged by the use of untrained8\ncommunity members to operate the water supply. The authors detail how the WSP9\nwas developed, but less so on how commitment was generated. The first stage of10\ndevelopment was a conference where the discussions on the importance of WSPs11\ntook place and this \u201cresulted in a firm commitment from all stakeholders to implement12\nWSPs in rural water supplies in Bangladesh\u201d. A number of questions arise:13\n\uf0b7 What were the important aspects of WSPs that generated this commitment?14\n\uf0b7 Who were the stakeholders involved?15\n\uf0b7 Were the community operators involved at this point?16\n\uf0b7 What constituted firm commitment?17\nFollowing success of a pilot project, evidence could be used to generate more18\ncommitment using this example through regular interaction and sharing of19\ninformation between organisations undertaking WSPs in Bangladesh (Mahmud et20\nal., 2007). The draft WSP manual (WHO, 2008) includes a number of case studies,21\none of which in Kampala Uganda, briefly mentions managerial commitment, sought22\nvia an initial briefing with senior management to discuss the benefits of a WSP.23\nAgain, detail on the mechanisms and demonstration of commitment is limited.24\n25\n17\nThese examples, both from developing countries, benefited from external funding1\nand\/or expertise in the form of research projects, and future commitment could have2\nbeen generated by the implementation phase. Commitment may not be so easy to3\nget in an organisation with little money, or prior to undertaking such a project.4\nGregor (2007) comments on the importance of local commitment and buy in when5\nimplementing WSPs in developing countries, where the driver comes from external6\naid agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Commenting on WSP7\nimplementation in the Pacific Islands, Gregor (2007) describes the aim enhancing8\nlocal capacity and involving governments in water safety planning so that when9\nexternal agencies leave, a legacy of local ownership and sustainability is secured.10\nLocal commitment was developed through participative workshops, and one-on-one11\ntraining for water utilities with experts. Similarly, reflecting on the development of a12\nWSP in the Caribbean (personal communication), senior managers at the water13\nauthority and key stakeholders were not engaged until the end of the process, which14\nthen proved difficult. Had regular meetings with senior management been15\nincorporated, buy-in to the recommendations from the plan may have been easier to16\nsecure.17\n18\nFrom developed nations, there is limited reference to managerial commitment in the19\ncase study literature. Mullenger et al (2002) describe the experience of South East20\nWater Limited, Australia, in implementing HACCP plans for drinking water. They21\ndocument a wide range of benefits for the organization, such as a greater22\nunderstanding of water quality issues, more streamlined work procedures and23\nimproved customer responses, giving rise to a reduction in the number of complaints24\nreceived. Initial managerial commitment is not discussed, but it was noted that \u201cthe25\n18\ninitial reaction of most staff to the implementation of HACCP was not favourable\u201d.1\nAlthough these attitudes changed towards the end of the project, little detail was2\ngiven on attempts to secure commitment at the outset, and the role that senior3\nmanagers played.4\n5\nLESSONS FROM OTHER FIELDS6\n7\nThere is a substantive literature on safety culture relevant to this discussion. In8\nconsidering safety culture, Hopkins (2005) argues that creating the right mindset9\namong employees is ultimately an issue of managerial commitment. Woerner (1996)10\nalso comments, \"Without true management commitment and visibility throughout the11\noperation, the safety program will never reach its greatest potential\u201d. Cooper (2006),12\nand Gyeke & Salminen (2007), demonstrated a close correlation in workplace safety13\nperception and the perceived support from management. Flin (2003) suggests once14\nmanagers are committed, they should regularly check this commitment is15\ncommunicated to their employees through surveys of perceptions and upward16\nappraisal; so-called \u2018climate surveys\u2019. Fernandez-Muniz et al. (2007) showed that17\nmanagers influence the safety culture of employees in two ways: indirectly through18\nsupport and funding for implementation and development of a safety management19\nsystem; and directly through positive attitudes and behaviours. They argue that20\npositive words in formal declarations are insufficient to modify employee behaviour,21\nand so managers must become personally involved in day to day actions in order to22\ndemonstrate commitment and modify behaviours. Likewise Flin (2003) argues that23\ngood safety management goes beyond knowing the \u2018safety script\u2019 and Hopkins24\n(2005) cautions that too often, leaders think that they can achieve safe operation by25\n19\npublicly stating that safety comes first, but then leaving it to others. This, he argues,1\ninadvertently conveys a message about priorities and he then summarises several2\nsurveys which found that whilst senior managers considered they put safety first,3\nfront line workers did not agree. Given these observations, we propose further4\ninvestigations into the communication of the basic business assumption of water5\nsuppliers, both within the organisations and to external stakeholders. Cost-benefit6\narguments and being able to demonstrate that best-practice is being undertaken7\nmay be helpful in getting the \u2018go-ahead\u2019 for a project but may inadvertently, promote8\na \u2018badge on the wall\u2019 mentality and foster complacency. Hrudey & Hrudey (2004)9\nobserved,\u201dSo many outbreaks appear to have been caused by neglect or10\ncomplacency that is incompatible with recognizing safe, clean drinking water as a top11\npriority in life. No amount of economic rationalisation can make sense of providing12\nmediocre service to the public for something so vitally important\u201d.13\n14\nWILL DEEPER COMMITMENT INFLUENCE UPTAKE OF WSPS?15\n16\nWe observe that commitment to public health appears infrequently within corporate17\naims and objectives. During this review, 91 English language water supplier18\nwebsites from across the world were reviewed. Of these, 61 presented some form of19\ncorporate statement (aims, objectives, visions and mission). Of these 61, 42 (69%)20\nincluded references to financial goals, 36 (59%) to environmental goals and 2521\n(41%) included reference to public health or safety of the water supplied. How22\nshould these priorities be managed in concert to ensure water safety and good risk23\ngovernance? Roberts & Bea (2001) show that HROs balance long term safety with24\nshort term financial goals and observe that \u201cwhen organisations focus on today\u2019s25\n20\nprofits without consideration of tomorrow\u2019s problems, the likelihood of accidents1\nincreases\u201d. Serious water quality incidents continue to occur. What is needed, we2\nbelieve, is a restatement (with evidence) of the commitment to protect public health3\ndriven by the broader requirements of organisational reliability, rather than financial4\nefficiency \u2013 a refreshed set of basic business assumptions for the water sector.5\n6\nSchneider & Shrivastava (1988) maintain the strategic behaviour of organisations7\ncan be understood by exploring these basic business assumptions - the content and8\nstructure of which determines organisational culture. Using Edgar Schein\u2019s definition9\nof basic assumptions , perceptions, thoughts, feelings and actions can be articulated10\nin stories, symbols and behaviours that \u201dreinforce, institutionalise, and promote11\norganisation-wide sharing\u201d (Schneider & Shrivastava, 1988). The authors describe12\nthree levels at which these psychodynamics operate: individual, group and13\norganisational, with the individual and group level contributing to the organisational14\nlevel, and vice versa. Individual psychodynamics contribute to organisational15\nmission, particularly of those at the top such as chief executive officers. Wider16\norganisational buy-in for projects or new ways of working may be helped or hindered17\nby the views of these key individuals. Group dynamics also facilitate or hinder18\nperformance, particularly within strategic decision-making groups. As Schneider &19\nShrivastava (1998) note, there are often sub-cultures within organisations with20\ndifferent basic assumptions. Within the context of WSP implementation, where21\nstakeholder involvement (both internal and external) is so often quoted as important,22\nthis may be highly influential; for example where the organisation is responsible for23\nwater supply (public health protection) and wastewater treatment (environmental24\nconsiderations) and, where privatisation of the water supply has occurred, financial25\n21\nconsiderations will be prevalent. There are different aspects to these basic1\nassumptions that must also be considered; namely, the number, pervasiveness,2\nintensity and explicitness (Schneider & Shrivastava, 1988). Broadly shared basic3\nassumptions (e.g. guardian of public health) between departments and levels may4\npromote greater commitment (e.g. to WSPs). The intensity with which this is held5\nmay result in uncommitted compliance (e.g. \u2018lip-service\u2019) or incorporation (the belief6\nthat WSPs are truly implemented with the aim of protecting public health). The7\nongoing questioning and testing of these basic assumptions may help ensure8\nperformance and decision making, and in this case ensure employees are aware of9\nwhy public health protection is important.10\n11\nDiMaggio & Powell (1983) identified three typologies for organisations adopting new12\npractices:13\n1. Coercive, where the practice is imposed by a more powerful authority.14\n2. Mimetic, where an organisation adopts the practices of more successful15\norganisations; and16\n3. Normative, when the organisation adopts practices that it considers17\nappropriate.18\nOne might argue that where the process is normative, internalisation of the practice19\nwill be greater.20\n21\nWe argue, with others (Hrudey & Walker, 2005), for a restatement to staff, customers22\nand stakeholders, of the organisational commitment to safe drinking water and the23\nadoption of preventative risk management. It is easy to assume that the basic24\nassumptions of public health protection are universally shared within a water25\n22\nsupplier, but we observe this is not always the case. Staff turnover, retirements,1\ndownsizing, outsourcing and generational influences all affect how pervasive the2\npublic health imperative is within water suppliers. Particularly when the regulatory3\npush to implement is strong, as it currently is, organisations rooted in compliance4\nmay not always see the strategic value of new practices (Kostova & Roth, 2002)5\n6\nCONCLUSIONS7\n8\nWater safety plans represent a generational opportunity to promote preventative risk9\nmanagement within water suppliers. However, to ensure success, the whole10\norganisation - especially senior management - need to be advocates for protecting11\npublic health. Guidance on securing buy-in is limited and too often focuses simply12\non endorsing a policy, or using financial efficiency arguments to generate executive13\nsupport.14\n15\nIn advancing these ideas, we do not wish to appear naive. We recognise the16\ndifference of emphasis between public health professionals and water utility17\nmanagers on the role of WSPs and risk based approaches. In practice, water utility18\nmanagers have a broader view of the objectives of their organisations and the19\nbenefits that a risk-based approach could bring. The Bonn Charter recognises these20\nbroader objectives such as customer trust and water acceptability, as well as health.21\nAdditionally, most utilities, certainly in developed countries, place a huge emphasis22\non customer service. Their customers regard the safety and reliability of water as23\nparamount, but this is often articulated in a personalised way rather than as a24\nsocietal commitment to the public health agenda. Possibly, this is because the25\n23\nimportance of water and sanitation as a public health measure is taken for granted1\nand has thus been inadvertently demoted as a primary motivator of behaviour.2\n3\nWater managers have to manage a wide range of varying priorities including the4\nlatest external political, media or regulator external pressures to manage (leakage,5\ndrought, bills, flooding, social tariffs). We recognise this does not mean that they6\nregard health and water safety as less important; rather that it risks becoming taken7\nfor granted under normal operating business conditions. We argue here that the8\npublic health motivator should be more clearly brought out in the WSP process as a9\nparamount objective and not lost among the other legitimate drivers. Further, this10\nshould apply to all stakeholders and not just utilities. We offer the following initial11\nsuggestions to water utility leaders:12\n\uf0b7 Recognise that the benefits of resourcing risk management are likely to13\ninclude fewer incidents.14\n\uf0b7 Do not neglect long term safety improvements over short term financial gains.15\n\uf0b7 Value sound risk governance as a strategic business asset in its own right.16\n\uf0b7 Consider the benefits of improved regulatory (and stakeholder) confidence17\nthat flow from good risk management.18\n\uf0b7 Greater knowledge is likely to deliver improved implementation.19\n\uf0b7 Challenging the beliefs and attitudes of staff with regards to WSPs will support20\ninternalisation as well as implementation.21\nOngoing IWA-funded research is providing resources for water utilities seeking to22\nimplement preventative risk management practices. Continued research in the area23\nof buy-in and commitment by the authors will feed into this, providing additional24\ninsights and practical assistance.25\n24\n1\nAcknowledgements2\nThis work has been funded by the International Water Association (IWA) as part of3\nthe \u2018Bonn Network\u2019 research project.
