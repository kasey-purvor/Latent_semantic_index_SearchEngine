Eisenberg and W. Kauzmann, Oxford\nUniversity Press, Oxford, 2005, pp. xii + 296. First published in 1969, re-issued in Oxford\nClassics Series. Scope: monograph. Level: undergraduate and postgraduate.\nWe are composed mostly of water. Life as we know it depends on liquid water, and most of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface is covered with it. Water, or the lack of it, is centrally involved in many\nhuman activities and disasters including floods, droughts and wars. So the properties of\nwater are of crucial importance for us all. In the civilised world, most people expect\nhot and cold running water at the turn of a tap, and they are well familiar with water\u2019s\nphase transitions to ice in their freezers and steam in their kettles. Yet few of them stop\nto wonder why the specific and latent heats of water are so big, or why ice floats. So\nthis re-issue of the classic text by Eisenberg and Kauzmann is greatly to be welcomed.\nThe authors have pulled together salient information about water from a multiplicity of\nsources and made it into a coherent whole, concentrating on how its physical properties\nare related to its structure. There are chapters on the water molecule, its vapour, ice,\nliquid water, and models of water. Interatomic and intermolecular forces, structure, and\nthermal and spectral properties are all treated in considerable detail.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 47, 237-238 (2006).\n"}
