I exclaimed, \u2018Now that\u2019s the kind\nof priest I\u2019d like in my church!\u2019\nExcept for spotlights on soloist and conductor,\nthe stage was darkened to a deep red as Glennie\nglided toward a set of Chinese opera gongs, tem-\nple blocks, log drum, and tam-tams and shrieked,\n\u2018Yoooo-EEEE!\u2019 with cries interrupted by slashes at\nthe instruments, as if raising the mythical gods of\nSingapore, Malaysia, and Thailand from the dead\nin a raucous incantation. It was what Steven\nStucky describes as the cadenza opening to this 25-\nminute, seven-movement work, which is played\nwithout breaks.\nThe second \u2018vision\u2019 is inspired by a weeping\nScottish wraith who haunts desolate lakes where\nshe washes the blood-stained clothes of fallen\nwarriors. Glennie pulled a large bow against edges\nof vibraphone, cymbals, and tam tams, while solo\ncello, brass, and winds drew out their haunting\nsounds not just left and right but back- and\nupstage, a three-dimensional orchestral effect that\nShui especially relished.\nIn the third movement, Welsh elves from\nQueen Mab\u2019s court produce a biting, snappy\nScarbo-like effect as marimba and xylophone chat-\ntered with piccolo and flute. It was the one\nmoment in the work where, at least in this hall, the\norchestra was under-balanced with the soloist.  \nThe fourth vision, inspired by the Maori\u2019s Long\nShark (or Milky Way) who foretells the coming of\nday, belies Stucky\u2019s essential orchestral palette,\nalmost an avant-garde version of Ravel, essentially\nFrench with its delicate transparency and, above\nall, atmospheric. Were those muted brass off-\nstage? No, they\u2019re a pair of flutes! And you\u2019d\nswear, especially in the Esplanade\u2019s highly rever-\nberant, bright, practically tactile acoustics, \nthat that hushed vibraphone was amplified, but \nit wasn\u2019t.\nThe fifth movement, \u2018Coyote\u2019, from the\nAmerican Indian tradition, serves up another hall-\nmark Stucky sound, a gorgeously melancholic\nFrench horn solo, which functions as transition to\nthe work\u2019s crisis point, inspired by evil Japanese\ngoblins who drive their victims insane. This sixth\nvision features a further essential Stucky charac-\nteristic, a really tight, rhythmically thrilling\nostinato which, with its 5\/4 meter, brass, and\npounding cowbell, builds to a ritualistic crescendo\nand a shattering climax.\nAs the resonance dissipates, a chorale-type\nfinale emerges, inspired by the Great Spirit in\nAmerican Indian tradition, who is in the very air\nwe breathe. After Glennie gently tapped first two\nsmall gongs and then two huge tam-tams, all\npitched from treble to bass, a fading chamber\norchestra replied. It\u2019s a pattern that decrescendos\nto an ethereal farewell. In fact, Glennie ended not\nwith the music itself but by standing point still,\nhammer suspended, for 30 to 45 seconds of total\nsilence, as if all the spirits of the world have been\nreturned to sleep, the world is once more quiet,\nand prayer in some form pervades all. While nei-\nther Stucky nor Glennie would take the bait when\nI mentioned the religious effect of the work, her\nvery visuals or his very titles simply won\u2019t let them\noff the hook. \nThis essentially atmospheric work was assisted\nenormously by Glennie\u2019s percussion technician,\nJames Wilson, who designed a constantly chang-\ning palette of colored lights, possible with the\ntheatre\u2019s state-of-the-art facilities. They were so\nsuperbly and subtly co-ordinated with the music\nthat it\u2019s a feature they will retain in all Glennie\u2019s\nperformances, facilities allowing.\nThe work \u2013 lacking, as Stucky says, any \u2018argu-\nment\u2019 or counterpoint \u2013 is not traditionally\nstructured. However, one SSO staff member who\nis not musically trained, caught the continuity that\nthreads it together. It\u2019s as if you have to be able to\nmaintain at any one moment a consciousness of\nwhat has been and an awareness of what\u2019s to come\nfor this piece to work, as it certainly did for me. \nHowever, in terms of effect on the audience,\nwho could hear it only once, one well-known crit-\nic was caught off-guard, since, as he put it, Spirit\nVoices is more introspective, segmented, larger in\nscope, and less lyrical than other works Glennie\nhas been premi\u00e8ring. Next to me, a slightly spacy\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773\n58 Tempo 58 (228) 58\u201378 \u00a9 2004 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0040298204000154 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nwoman in her 30s, an untrained concert-goer, \ndidn\u2019t applaud at all. And both nights, while the\naudience greeted Glennie enthusiastically (she\u2019s\nan audience favorite who\u2019s even recorded with the\norchestra for BIS), they seemed to applaud only\ntepidly for the work itself. The tepidity puzzled\nme Friday night, since you could hear a pin drop in\nthe hall, though on Saturday there was plenty of\nstifled coughs and \u2018clearing of the phlegm\u2019, and\nnot just during that silent finale.\nIn addition to the instruments already men-\ntioned, the work is scored for marimba, Burmese\ngong, agogo, and a few pieces of metal that that\nlook like large tractor bolts which even Stucky\ncouldn\u2019t name. Two instruments were withdrawn\nduring rehearsals, and one, which was not avail-\nable, Stucky dearly wishes for. He is a man who\ncomposes without a computer, only near a piano\nkeyboard, and who can\u2019t conceive of harmony\napart from orchestral color. While prepared for\nadvice from Glennie and Shui, Stucky said the\nwork has needed no major surgery. Only a few\ndynamics were tweaked, and tempos remain rela-\ntively close to what he imagined.\nGlennie absolutely needed to see the entire\nscore to see how her part fit into what Stucky\nintended, which is another way of saying that the\norchestral score is as glittering, delicate, and sub-\nstantial as the soloist\u2019s. As Stucky said, while\nthere\u2019s plenty of time when orchestra members\nare silent, there is no time for any of them not to\nconcentrate. Both Glennie and Shui felt that the\nopen space and wet (vs. dry) acoustics of the\nEsplande\u2019s Concert Hall were ideal because they\nallowed time for sounds to travel, amplify, meld,\nand linger.\nStucky\u2019s work was the last of five world pre-\nmi\u00e8res commissioned for the Singapore\nSymphony\u2019s first season at the Esplanade (their\nseason runs January through December). The\nothers were by Aaron Jay Kernis, Bright Sheng,\nZhou Long, and Joyce Koh). The inaugural season\nalso featured the Sounds of Asia Series with works\nby Chen Pei-Xun, Liu Wen Jin, Phoon Yew Tien,\nBernard Tan, and Chen Yi. \nBy contrast, their 2004 season seems surprising-\nly tame. There\u2019s one world premi\u00e8re (by John\nSharpley), one concert with six Chinese com-\nposers during Chinese New Year, a six-day Silk\nRoad Festival with guess who (one concert is with\nthe orchestra), and a Chinese fortune cookie\n(Chen Gang\u2019s Butterfly Lovers Concerto). Other 20th-\ncentury works are standards by this point in time.\nConcerning the Esplanade itself, which has a\n2000-seat house built for opera, ballet, musicals\nwith amplification, etc., plus a recital hall and \nflexible black box theatre, the season is pro-\ngrammed in advance only about 40%.\nManagement first schedules the annual Chinese,\nMalay, and Indian festivals. Around them high-\nlights in 2004 include the Hong Kong ballet\nperforming The Last Emperor with choreography\nby Canadian Wayne Ealing and music by Su Cong;\na program of new Chinese music; performances\nby the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, the London\nSymphony, and the world premi\u00e8re of Robert\nWilson\u2019s La Galigo, a Southeast Asian theatre-\ndance-music-poetry epic that will subsequently\ntour to Amsterdam, Barcelona, and New York\nCity. During the other 60% of the season,\nEsplanade management strives to lure everything\nfrom community groups to international artists\nand ensembles that give a cross-current of the per-\nformance scene today. \nThe Esplanade is one of the world\u2019s few venues\nthat also contains a shopping mall, arts library,\nnumerous restaurants, and ample space for visual\nart displayed not behind windows but in open\nspaces where people can interact with it. As mem-\nbers of management clearly conveyed, they strives\nto make art a life style rather than a separate entity,\nwith their guiding light being that there\u2019s no\n\u2018we\u2019ve got it right\u2019 arrogance but rather a flexibili-\nty to integrate whatever new comes along, as long\nas it physically fits into the size and technical\ngivens of the facilities. While they program to\nattract Singaporeans and the residents of the\nMalay peninsula rather than tourists, with such an\nopen and creative attitude, visitors will find them-\nselves in one of the major cultural capitals of the\nworld. \nGil French\nLondon, St John\u2019s Smith Square: \nDavid Matthews\u2019s \u2018A Vision and a Journey\u2019\nA Vision and a Journey is David Matthews\u2019s op. 60 \u2013\na neat coincidence, then, that the first perform-\nance of its revised version should be part of the\ncelebrations of his sixtieth birthday. The work is\npart of a series of imposing orchestral scores\nMatthews has been composing over the past two\ndecades, beginning with In the Dark Time in 1983\nand continuing with Chaconne in 1985 and The\nMusic of Dawn two years later; this one followed in\n1993, when it was premi\u00e8red by Yan Pascal\nTortelier and the BBC Philharmonic, but it under-\nwent a thoroughgoing revision between March\n1996 and March 1997. I asked the composer before\nthe concert what the revisions had entailed: \u2018I\ncompletely rewrote the whole thing. It\u2019s more or\nless a new work\u2019.\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 59\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nIf the title suggests a parallel with Sibelius\u2019s Night\nRide and Sunrise, Matthews\u2019s programme note\nmakes the connections explicit \u2013 referring to the\nthree orchestral scores which preceded it, he\nwrites: \u2018I have called these three pieces symphonic\npoems, maintaining a Sibelian distinction between\nthat title and the symphony (I have also written four\nof these [five, in fact, but I guess his point is that No.\n4 is for chamber orchestra]). A Vision and a Journey\nhas, I think, even more of a symphonic character\nthan the others, and so I have called it a symphonic\nfantasia, again after Sibelius (Pohjola\u2019s Daughter)\u2019.\nThe music doesn\u2019t deny the relationship, either: it\nhas an obvious consanguinity with Sibelius\u2019s great\nnature-paintings in Tapiola, The Oceanides and those\nother late, dark masterpieces.\nStructurally, Matthews should have called the\npiece Visions and a Journey: the \u2018visions\u2019 are brief\npassages, three in number, which affect the course\nof the \u2018journey\u2019 the music takes over its 20-minute\nduration. It opens with a bright, scherzando ges-\nture which swiftly disappears behind an expansive\nSibelian landscape, solemn and strong. A series of\nstring solos, rising from the double-bass to the vio-\nlin, generates a wonderfully sonorous, mournful\nsong in tutti strings \u2013 Matthews likens it to a 17th-\ncentury fantasia \u2013 which mounts to a brief climax.\nThe strings again dominate the dignified fugal\npassage which follows, where the contrapuntal\nwriting points to the influence of Tippett. Brass\nand percussion suggest they have angrier things to\nsay, but the threat of conflict recedes, and the\nmusic stretches into a luminous Andante, with\nsolo oboe and cor anglais lines wheeling over rich-\nly detailed orchestral textures. One senses that\nMatthews is keeping something in reserve, and he\nnow deploys some of the power he has generated\n\u2013 although he never really lets all his dogs off the\nleash. Heroic brass-writing over tremolando strings\nbring a hint of Korngold, with muscular surges of\nenergy suggesting the same wide-open vistas you\nfind in the music of Roy Harris. A huge climax\nblasts everything but held string tone from the\nlandscape; there\u2019s a flash of colour from the open-\ning scherzando material, a wave of excitement\nsuggests our goal is in view and, with a blaze of\nbrass, the piece stops dead \u2013 too abruptedly,\nindeed, given the distance covered (Matthews\u2019s\nFifth Symphony likewise ends a few chords too\nsoon), but that\u2019s the only misjudgement in a com-\nmanding, rigorously honest score.\nA Vision and a Journey confirms David\nMatthews\u2019s standing as one of Britain\u2019s most\nimportant composers for the orchestra. Hats off,\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f60\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthen, to the Kensington Symphony Orchestra and\nits conductor Russell Keable for their endeavour\nand a fine performance \u2013 and shame on the rest of\nBritain\u2019s orchestral establishment for letting six\nyears of dust gather on the score.\nMartin Anderson\nWarwick Arts Centre: Julian Anderson\u2019s\nSymphony\nThe demise of the Symphony is frequently\nannounced, yet easily refuted by the quality of con-\ntemporary works bearing that title. Many recent\nexamples have been written by British composers \u2013\nAnthony Powers\u2019s Second, James MacMillan\u2019s\nThird, David Matthews\u2019s Fifth and Peter Maxwell\nDavies\u2019s Seventh, for example. To this distinguished\nlist must be added Julian Anderson\u2019s Symphony.\nHis four previous orchestral works contain suffi-\ncient structural ingenuity and intellectual rigour to\nmake the cogency of his new piece no great sur-\nprise, yet it also offers some of Anderson\u2019s most\nlyrical as well as intricate writing.\nMysterious shivers from vertically bowed strings\ninitiate the Symphony from the edge of inaudibility\ninto a kind of glacial stasis. Ethereal tremolandos\nachieved by vertical bowing and the gossamer\nsounds of cotton threaded through piano strings\ncreate a fragile Nordic ice sculpture ready to be\nthawed and moulded. In true symphonic manner,\nthese opening pages contain all the material from\nwhich the rest of the work unfolds.  \nSonorous bass clarinet, contrabassoon and\ntuba introduce an important ascending figure. A\nscherzo breaks in, which culminates in a brass fan-\nfare leading to the slow movement. This is the\nlyrical heart of the piece. Its intense string melody\nis reminiscent of the big-hearted main theme of\nthe slow movement of Malcolm Arnold\u2019s Fifth\nSymphony. Just as Arnold meant what he said, but\napologised for his sentimental tune as an \u2018emo-\ntional clich\u00e9\u2019, Anderson disrupts his broadly\nconceived theme with bursts of a second scherzo\nwhich appear between the cracks of the melody,\nguying it, yet at the same time strengthening it, so\nthat it grows in intensity and resolve.\nThe final section is a manic whirligig steadily\naccelerating to the very limit of playability and\ninvolving extreme compression of material.\nThere is a last reminder of the opening material\nfrom which the whole symphony grew, before a\nbrief concluding Prestissimo. The skill of the\norchestration is such that the closing fanfare, that\nmakes the loudest noise in the score, involves a\nmere 12 players.\nJust as Prokofiev, in his Classical Symphony,\nimagined the kind of work Haydn might have\nwritten had he lived into the 20th Century, it is not\nperhaps too fanciful to hear, in Julian Anderson\u2019s\nSymphony, sounds and forms Sibelius could have\ndevised if he were still active today. Links with\nFinland and its foremost composer are strong:\nwoodwind calls featured in the score are based on\nthe cranes of Finland, the work is dedicated to the\nCBSO conductor Sakari Oramo and inspired by a\npainting of a lake unfreezing in early spring by\nSibelius\u2019s great friend, the painter Axel Gallen. The\nsingle-movement structure and gradual transfor-\nmations call to mind not only the monumental\nSeventh Symphony of the Finnish symphonist, but\nalso the ever-accelerating sonata form\/scherzo\nhybrid of his Fifth\u2019s Symphony\u2019s first movement.\nMighty thunderclaps signify nodal points in\nAnderson\u2019s score, functioning the same way as the\nmajestic trombone theme that thrice breasts the\nsonorous peaks of Sibelius\u2019s Seventh.       \nA triumph for the composer, the CBSO and\nOramo, the Symphony\u2019s world premi\u00e8re in\nWarwick Arts Centre combined a tense, edgy\nexcitement with raw, elemental power. Oramo\nand the Birmingham players revelled in the score\u2019s\nexotic colouristic effects, such as detuned piano,\nflute and clarinet  which subtly enriched an\nextremely wide-ranging palette. In sum, a concise\nand compelling 18-minute piece, successfully\nincorporating such diverse elements as jazz and\nfolk, along with microtonal effects and a glorious\ndiatonic melody. Although there are no immedi-\nate plans for a cycle, Anderson may yet prove to be\none of Britain\u2019s most notable symphonists, follow-\ning the illustrious example of his great mentors\nAlexander Goehr and Oliver Knussen.     \nPaul Conway\nLondon, Queen Elizabeth Hall and \nBrighton Dome: Big Noise Tour\nBig Noise \u2013 heard in London on 21 November and\nrepeated at the Dome (Corn Exchange) in Brighton\non the 22nd \u2013 was a collaboration between the\nhighly idiosyncratic New Music ensembles Orkest\nde Volharding (Holland) and Icebreaker (UK). The\nformer was established by the amazingly influential\nDutch composer Louis Andriessen: reacting\nagainst the elitist music of his youth, he saw the\nneed for a new type of Art-music ensemble which\ncould travel into the streets and play music with a\nbroad appeal. Borrowing from the model of Dutch\nstreet bands (the equivalent, perhaps, of the UK\u2019s\nbrass bands), jazz of the 1920s, Minimal music\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 61\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncoming out of America and the European avant-\ngarde, Andriessen created an ensemble and a\nlanguage with an overt non-elitist agenda. \nModelled initially on Andriessen\u2019s second\nensemble (\u2018Hoketus\u2019), Icebreaker took an even\nmore extreme stance: they played amplified and\nassertive music, aiming for a communicative and\ndistinctive style created from a seamless fusion of\ndiverse modern vernaculars. For both ensembles,\nrepertoire was carefully chosen to suit political\nand musical agendas.\nSome may have found it surprising, therefore,\nthat the pieces in the Big Noise programme were\nin many ways uncharacteristic of both ensembles.\nNew works were commissioned from two British\nand two Dutch composers, yet the \u2018sound\u2019 most in\nevidence was distinctly of the variety pioneered\nby Andriessen in the late 1970s and formalized by\nmany in Dutch orchestral music of the 80s and\nbeyond. The distinctly \u2018classical\u2019 bent was reflect-\ned in the concert\u2019s stiff presentation (complete\nwith orchestral layout and the tradition of giving\nbouquets to the frontline participants); in many\nways, the videos that accompanied each work\nwere the main concession not only to these\ngroups\u2019 aesthetics, but also to modernity. It is per-\nhaps a reflection of this that the performances,\nalthough mainly of good quality, seemed rather\nformal and constrained: they lacked the gleeful\nabandon, the ecstatic energy, that characterizes\nthe two groups at their best.\nYannis Kyriakides\u2019 Lab Fly Dreams most\navoided the \u2018Dutch\u2019 sound, opting instead for the\nkind of lively and iridescent rhythmic layering\n(and even closely similar rhythms) of Michael\nGordon\u2019s 1992 Yo! Shakespeare for Icebreaker. It\nwas one of the stronger of the collaborations\nbetween composer and video artist \u2013 in this case\nH.C. Gilje \u2013 with the music\u2019s twitchy rhythms\nand insectile electronic clicks counterpointed\nenergetically and humorously by the video\u2019s itch-\ninducing colour- and speed-modified close-ups of\nfrantic moths.\nJoe Cutler described his Jack the Diamond\u2019s\nJamming Station as \u2018mostly full-on\u2019, but the distinc-\ntion between mere bombast and the emotional\nintensity and sheer resolve so ably demonstrated\nby Papa Andriessen seems to have escaped him on\nthis occasion. The work\u2019s jazzy ending may have\nbeen intended as a concession to the importance\nof jazz in the outlooks of both groups, but its suc-\ncess both as a conclusion and as a contribution to\nan apposite sound-world was dubious. It was not\nthe only point at which the language was unset-\ntlingly outdated (I couldn\u2019t help recalling the\nclimaxes of Schoenberg\u2019s op. 16 no.4 on frequent\noccasions); responding, perhaps, to these\nanachronisms, the video by Jaap Drupsteen\nappeared to be based on a kind of Grand Guignol\nwith pop-video colour.\nThe deeply intense and introspective stasis of\nDiderik Wagenaar\u2019s Pantomima had considerably\nmore impact. It offered the most keenly heard of\nall the textures of the programme; taut harmony\nand tightly-controlled gestures made this a com-\npelling \u2013 though by no means broadly popular \u2013\nexperience. The video by Hexstatic, a stately affair\nof blossoming stone-in-a-pond circular waves,\nwas attractive enough in itself for short periods,\nbut its Mickey Mousing of the salient events in the\nWagenaar soon proved irritating and intrusive,\nand its apparently automated progress was no\nmatch for the carefully-crafted subtleties of the\nmusic.\nThe strongest of the evening\u2019s collaborations\nwas that between Cornelis de Bondt and Tom\nHadley. De Bondt had written for a similar project,\nKaalslag, in the 1980s, one involving de Volharding\nand Hoketus. The new work, Gli Toccha la Mano,\nexhibited many of the same characteristics as de\nDeuren Gesloten, the work written for the earlier\nevent: a deliberately orchestral approach to the\ncombined forces, harmonies hinting at Purcell\u2019s,\nstructures of imposing scale and a frequently over-\nwhelmingly powerful passion. De Bondt\u2019s ability\nto combine Minimalist extension with enormous\nmusical complexity is a beguiling paradox. The\npresence of singer Cristina Zavalloni initially pro-\nduced an operatic effect which was truly bizarre\ngiven the groups involved, but her impressive\nrange of vocal styles soon proved effective in this\nwork of extremes.

It is generally\nless well known that Boston also has the smaller\nand equally fine Jordan Hall, located in the New\nEngland Conservatory. A fixture of Boston\u2019s\nmusical life, Jordan Hall is also literally the heart of\nthe Conservatory, being the venue not only of vis-\niting celebrity solo and chamber music recitals,\nbut of a multitude of the whole range of the\nConservatory\u2019s student concert activity.\nIn celebration of Jordan Hall\u2019s centennial in\nOctober of 2003, New England Conservatory\ncommissioned a major work from Gunther\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f62\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nSchuller, one of the school\u2019s former presidents.\nScored for a mammoth orchestra (including two\nPianos \u2013 one tuned to quarter tones \u2013 and littered\nwith such rarely-encountered instruments as bass\ntrumpet, bass oboe, and contrabass clarinet), plus\njazz band, vocalists, and three improvising jazz\nsoloists, Encounters is in the tradition of Schuller\u2019s\n\u2018Third Stream\u2019 works from the 1950s and 60s, \nparticularly Conversations, and those others writ-\nten for the Modern Jazz Quartet with various\n\u2018classical\u2019 ensembles. But its scope, in terms of its\nforces, its length, and its vision, makes all of those\nworks seem to be prefatory sketches. Schuller\u2019s\nThird Stream music was purported to be a fusion\nof Jazz and Classical Music; in fact, those two\nstreams never really fused, but ran side by side in\nthe same channel. In the earlier pieces this sepa-\nrateness was a function of Schuller\u2019s insistence on\nadopting a 12-tone idiom for his \u2019classical\u2019 music, a\nlanguage which the jazz players he worked with \u2013\nall of whom were indisputably among the greatest\nof their time \u2013 were not able to incorporate into\ntheir playing style; this made necessary a calcula-\ntion which kept the styles discrete. Encounters also\npresents its classical and jazz elements in alterna-\ntion and juxtaposition, but there is more overlap\nof the styles \u2013 accounted for both by the fact that\njazz players today have a general greater familiari-\nty with more complex tonal languages, and by a\nmore comprehensive range of organization of\nmaterial in the non-jazz music.\nEncounters is in four continuous movements,\ntracing a dream-like continuity encompassing a\nlarge variety of different textures, ranging from\ndead still to turbulently chaotic. These follow one\nafter another in a way which, although not follow-\ning an immediately apparent logic, is always\ncompletely convincing. The jazz aspect of the\nwork, represented by a big band and three impro-\nvising soloists, threads its way through the\nargument of the piece, evolving in style from early\nDuke Ellington to Miles Davis and beyond. The\nwhole work, bristling with a multitude of musical\nevents evoking a whole world of experience,\ntraces a giant arc which is both inherently satisfy-\ning and also moving in what it reveals of Schuller\u2019s\nmany musical interests and pursuits over the\ncourse of his life. and of his tirelessly generous\npersonality. Although there can be no question of\n\u2018influences\u2019 on a mature master composer,\nEncounters nonetheless bears witness to the two\ncomposers who are the closest to Schuller\u2019s heart:\nIves and Ellington.\nThe composer conducted the concert which\nconcluded with his new work and which began\nwith the Melpomene Overture by one of his pre-\ndecessors, George Chadwick, which had been\nperformed on Jordan Hall\u2019s inaugural concert. For\nthe performance of Encounters, the stage of the\nhall was full to the brim with the New England\nConservatory Philharmonia, consisting of more\nthan 150 devoted players, led by the wonderful\njazz soloists, Allan Chase (alto saxophone),\nSeamus Blake (tenor saxophone), and Dave Ballou\n(trumpet).  Schuller feels, with some justification,\nthat he was truly inspired during the composition\nof his work; the performers seemed also to have\nbeen inspired, both by the occasion and by the\nmusic which celebrated it.\nRodney Lister\nLondon, Barbican: Masterprize Final\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Masterprize, the interna-\ntional composition competition with a mission \u2018to\nbring music lovers and composers closer togeth-\ner\u2019, is a slick and professional operation, with a\ntremendous outreach. The CD with the six pieces\nwhich made it to the final (of some 1,000 entries)\nwas stuck on the front of both Gramophone and\nClassic FM magazines, with a joint print-run of\naround 100,000. The \u2018gala final\u2019 in the Barbican on\n30 October, when the London Symphony\nOrchestra was conducted by Daniel Harding, was\nbroadcast live on Classic FM (which reaches 6.5\nmillion listeners a week), NPR in the States (16\nmillion) and Radio Latvia (you tell me); and NPR\nalso packaged it for their deferred \u2018Symphony\nCast\u2019. These are scarcely believable figures for\ncontemporary classical music: Masterprize is\nplainly doing an enormous amount of good.\nAnother statistic worth celebrating is that 1,300\nchildren were involved in the associated education\nproject, playing the six works up and down the\nUK. It\u2019s just a pity that most of the music that\nmade it through to the final was so dull, a post-\nHollywood syrup of feel-good consonance and\nglittering over-orchestration \u2013 slickly wrapped\nempty boxes. \nThe finalists, for the record, were Les Fleuves\nengloutis by Bechara El Khoury (France, b. 1957),\nTango (in fact, a tango suite) by Arturs Maskats\n(Latvia, b. 1957), Einstein\u2019s Violin by Robert\nHenderson (USA, b. 1948), You Must Finish Your\nJourney Alone by Anton Plate (Germany, b. 1950),\nthe Symphony No. 6 by Nicolas Bacri (France, b.\n1961) and Rainbow Body by Christopher\nTheofanidis (USA, b. 1967).

Rainbow Body opens with tremolo strings\nthat briefly suggest we\u2019re about to enjoy a\nBrucknerian scherzo; instead, a solo cello prattles\nearnestly until the Hildegard theme is quoted in\nits entirety by the strings; when the rest of the\norchestra takes it up, it might as well be the back-\nground score for a spaghetti western or Ben Hur\nsound-alike. Theofanidis throws in bongos, horns\nbells up, Sibelian string-writing, a touch of\nRimsky Korsakov, a fanfare borrowed from\nMahler, relinquishing any hope of focus with each\ntwist of his over-scored kaleidoscope. Quite how\nhe managed to walk away with the \u00a325,000 prize\nbeats me. Ted Perry, founder of Hyperion\nRecords, made an early recording of Hildegard,\nthe sales of which (350,000 units, and counting)\nkept Hyperion buoyant for years, amazing Perry\nand allowing him to make all sorts of bold reper-\ntoire choices. It seems she\u2019s not done with the\nmiracle-working yet.\nFor my ears, the sole score that deserved the\nprize was Bacri\u2019s symphony \u2013 for all its brevity, a\nreal symphony with weight and moment, the only\nwork among the six that demanded and rewarded\nits listeners\u2019 attention, generating and deploying a\nhead of violent energy over the course of its\ntwelve minutes. It begins, Helios Overture-like,\nlow in the strings, with the horns intoning a hymn\nabove them; the demonic scherzo which then\nbreaks out brought us the first functional counter-\npoint of the concert. That first explosion is\nfollowed by an uneasy calm, with questing instru-\nmental recitatives exploring the path ahead. The\ntempo quickens again, but the imminent threat of\nfurther force is averted by another temporary\npeace; instead, one senses trouble being prepared\nin the background, and it now erupts in a boiling\norchestral toccata. Energy spent, a dark Adagio\nwhich shares some genetic material with\nSibelius\u2019s Fourth Symphony unfolds a tragic,\ndeeply felt elegy. Another anguished toccata\nerupts, though edgy string recitatives pinion its\npassion until the energy can no longer be con-\ntained and the music rushes to its conclusion.\nBacri\u2019s Sixth generally inhabits the bottom of\nthe orchestra, which he flecks with points of light\nfrom higher registers \u2013 again, he was the only one\nof the six who didn\u2019t leap at the orchestral palette\nlike a sailor hitting port; instead, his skilful han-\ndling of sonority meant that, unlike the others, his\ntuttis told. Bacri\u2019s general reliance on content\nrather than colour isn\u2019t something one often asso-\nciates with French composers; indeed, the\nSibelian inheritance in his orchestration pointed\nto parallels with Rautavaara and other Nordic\ncomposers, though my innocent ear might also\nhave assumed the work to be from an American\npen. Bacri can take some compensation from the\nthought that his music has now reached an audi-\nence far bigger than ever before; with luck, it\nmight precipitate the wider dissemination of the\nrest of his \u0153uvre.\nMartin Anderson\nManchester, RNCM: Robin Holloway\u2019s String\nQuartet, op. 97\nThe world premi\u00e8re of Robin Holloway\u2019s String\nQuartet, given by the Endellion Quartet at the\nRNCM on 13 October 2003, came in the midst of a\nnumber of concerts around the country marking\nthe composer\u2019s 60th birthday. (Let us not forget,\ntoo, Claridge Press\u2019s publication of Holloway\u2019s\nwritings, also coinciding with this anniversary.)1\nClever programming between Haydn\u2019s quartet\nop. 76 no. 4 and Brahms\u2019s op. 51 no. 2, enabled one\nto appreciate Holloway\u2019s first essay in this genre in\nthe context (on the one hand) of a composer for\nwhom the string quartet was seemingly an effort-\nless medium, and (on the other) of a composer on\nwhom the quartet tradition weighed heavily. For\nHolloway too, the string quartet proved problem-\natic, and almost unassailable \u2013 his highly\nbiographical programme-note revealed an initial\ninability to engage with \u2018this most hallowed of the\nclassic media, with its incomparably rich litera-\nture\u2019. This inhibition threatened to stifle work\naltogether, for it was only a final attempt in August\n2003, after three \u2018sterile years\u2019 of trying, that\nHolloway found a way through the problems the\nstring quartet posed him.\nIn a pre-concert talk as part of the RNCM\u2019s\n\u2018Holloway Resonances\u2019 festival (which followed\nthree days after this premi\u00e8re), Holloway con-\ntrasted the increasingly public development of the\nsymphony in the 19th century with the string\nquartet, which, despite a couple of noteworthy\nexamples, remained \u2013 and remains \u2013 the \u2018most\ninnately musical\u2019 of the classical media. Little\nwonder, therefore, that op. 97 is one of Holloway\u2019s\nworks that avoids quotation; it is, as far as his (or\nany) musical language allows, self-sufficient.\nUnusual too for so fertile a composer, but bound\nup in the seriousness of the medium, was the deci-\nsion to restrict the amount of the quartet\u2019s\nmaterial; despite an episodic structure, the result-\ning argument is particularly taut. Contributing to\nthis tautness is the fact that the structure is project-\ned against the background of three movements\n1 On Music: Essays and Diversions 1963\u20132003 by Robin Holloway. A\nreview is planned for a future issue of Tempo (Ed.).\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f64\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n(the composer refers to them as sections), which\ncan also be viewed as a single ternary form. Thus\nthe middle section is at once a slow movement and\ncontrasting \u2018B section\u2019, and the last movement a\ncommentary on the first \u2013 which, as it accelerates,\nalso serves to recapitulate elements of the second.   \nThe first movement, marked allegro con molto,\nconsists of a series of contrasting paragraphs that,\nHaydnesque, continually re-work the opening\nmaterial announced by the second violin and\npizzicato cello. This particular pairing of instru-\nments begins what seems to be a detailed\nexploration of the different combinations avail-\nable within the quartet medium; the exploitation\nof these combinations contributes to the discur-\nsive quality of the opening. The supple linearity\nand intensity of the writing \u2013 performed with con-\nviction by the Endellions \u2013 yields roughly halfway\nthrough the movement to what at first seemed to\nbe a reprise of the opening theme. However, from\nthis point, the textures become somewhat thicker,\nand the writing more lyrical: the \u2018reprise\u2019 serves as\na point of reference dividing the movement into\ntwo, and not as a point of return. The movement\ndissolves, rather than ends, with a series of sul pon-\nticello fragments; these give way (after a bar\u2019s\nsilence) to the second movement.  \nAn intriguing inversion of the respective roles\nof fast and slow music results in the slow second\nmovement functioning as the violent emotional\ncore of the quartet \u2013 Holloway describes it as a\n\u2018grind\u2019. Formally, it is a march and trio, culminat-\ning in a \u2018climax in Sarabande-rhythm\u2019. The gritty\ntension of the march, raised to further heights in\nthe grim, muted trio, is only partially released at\nthe end of the movement in a series of radiant\nchords, one of the most affecting passages in the\nquartet.  \nThe radical compression of the final move-\nment  \u2013 it lasts roughly three minutes in a work\nstretching to over 20 \u2013 provides the work with an\nexhilarating close. It begins with a direct state-\nment of the opening of the quartet (the third and\nfinal such statement overall), although it was hard\non one hearing to detect if all the strands of the\nfirst were recapitulated (I suspect that they are!).\nHolloway\u2019s programme-notes talk of the re-\nangling of the tonal orientation \u2018to focus ever\nagain on the home key\u2019: to my ears, this was\naccomplished via extended dominant pedals. The\nlength of this preparation made the eventual short\noutburst at the end, a traditional cadential gesture\nand close on a C, all the more surprising. This\nreflects the overall proportions of the quartet, in\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 65\nBrochure T 01242 237377\nBookings T 01242 227979 \nwww.cheltenhamfestivals.co.uk\nCelebrating 60 years of contemporary \nBritish music with 60 premi\u00e8res.\nLondon Sinfonietta \u2022 BCMG\nArditti Quartet \u2022 Duke Quartet\nEndymion \u2022 Harrison Birtwistle weekend\nBBC Radio 3 Hear & Now series\nCHELTENHAM\nINTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF\nMUSIC\n2-18 JULY 2004\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nwhich the two longer movements build up consid-\nerable tension to be resolved in a short space of\ntime. The relative brevity of both the closure and\nthe final movement as a whole might best be\nunderstood in the context of the history of the\ncomposition of the work: in noting that the biog-\nraphical details serve \u2018as a reminder that what was\nimpossible for so long can be resolved so briefly\u2019,\nHolloway seems in effect to be offering an analogy\n\u2013 and explanation \u2013 for the structure.    \nThe attendance for both this concert and the\nsubsequent \u2018Resonances\u2019 festival was disappoint-\ning, especially as the latter provided one with the\nrare opportunity to hear works from throughout\nHolloway\u2019s career and for a variety of media. The\ncentral concert, in which Martyn Brabbins con-\nducted Scenes from Schumann, the Violin Concerto\n(with Ernst Kovacic as the soloist) and the Second\nConcerto for Orchestra, was perhaps the high-\nlight, although the Brown Shipley Concert Hall\nwas too small a venue to allow one to cope with the\nhigh decibel-level of much of the latter work. If\nthese three works represent Holloway\u2019s penchant\nfor quotation, the delightful Souvenirs de Monsalvat,\nwonderfully performed by Kathryn Eves and Ruth\nHollick in a late-night concert following the\norchestra, and the Five Haydn Miniatures (present-\ned alongside Evening with Angels by the RNCM\nNew Ensemble on the final night) show\nHolloway\u2019s capacity for stylization. This was taken\nto further lengths in the Serenade for B flat, in\nwhich \u2018the main spirit is homage to Mozart\u2019s\nworks\u2019, performed somewhat nervously by\nRNCM students in a lunchtime concert. In the con-\ntext of these pieces (the festival also featured music\nby Holloway for wind and brass bands, as well as\nthe song cycle Wherever we may be), the quartet\nemerges as a particularly serious and heartfelt\nwork. Whether these qualities are enough in the\ncurrent musical climate to persuade other quartets\nto take it up (the Endellion quartet performed it\nagain in Cambridge in November 2003; they will\ngive the US premi\u00e8re in June 2004) remains to be\nseen. It would be a pity to have to wait for another\nanniversary to prompt further performances.\nEdward Venn\nLondon, BBC Maida Vale Studios: \nJustin Connolly\u2019s Piano Concerto.  \nMany of Justin Connolly\u2019s works have been pre-\nmi\u00e8red and recorded by Nicholas Hodges, whose\nmusicianship provided the inspiration for\nConnolly\u2019s Piano Concerto (2001\u20132003). The\nform and character of the piece are influenced by\nthe ancient idea of the labyrinth, the forces of\nsoloist and orchestra being well suited to the roles\nof Theseus and the Minotaur, where one protago-\nnist signifies the existence of the other and the\ndistinction between hero and villain is not always\napparent. The orchestral forces employed are\nunexceptional. Brass and percussion are divided\ninto two separate groups to the left and right of\nthe conductor, whilst the first horn player sits\napart from his colleagues and is mirrored by a\nfourth, offstage, horn player.\nThe archetype of the traditional piano concer-\nto lurks within this score, which divides its\none-movement structure into three large sections\ncorresponding to the classical concerto form.\nWithin this division are 14 processes, affiliated to\none another by the technique of developing varia-\ntion, and reflecting the traditional labyrinthine\nstructure of seven concentric tracks, each tra-\nversed twice during the ritual, from the entrance\nto the centre and back again. Connolly extends the\nidea of grouping variations together \u2013 as in\nBeethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, for example \u2013 by\nmaking them overlap so that images recur in \ndifferent contexts.\nDuring the predominantly fast first movement,\nthere are occasional recitative-like passages in\nwhich the important horn obbligato and its off-\nstage surrogate take the role of an unseen mentor,\nexhorting the soloist to venture further into the\nlabyrinth. The playing in these reflective sections\nis freer and non-metrical.\nIn the slow movement, the horn player has an\nextended cantilena and the solo piano eventually\nreaches a point where his music and that of the\nhorn coalesce in a moment of mutual recognition\nand enlightenment. This is the central crux of the\nwork \u2013 and the Golden Section of the piece. Its \nsatisfying feeling of inevitability testifies to\nConnolly\u2019s unerring sense of tempo and structure.  \nThe finale, with its steady increase of pace and\npower, implies a triumphant return to the outside\nworld, strengthened by a new awareness and\nunderstanding. It is indebted to jazz, especially the\nvirtuoso technique and physical stamina in the\nplaying of Cecil Taylor, and combines a feeling of\nrelease with a convincing pulling together of the\nconcerto\u2019s many different strands.\nPowerful and eloquent, Justin Connolly\u2019s Piano\nConcerto makes a considerable emotional\nimpact, its thrilling virtuosity always at the service\nof expressive clarity. It embraces the sort of bold\ncontrasts usually associated with Connolly\u2019s\nmusic: judicious juxtaposition of stasis and\ndynamism; confrontational versus symbiotic rel-\nationship between soloist and orchestra and a\nkaleidoscopic handling of short cell-like motifs\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f66\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncontrasted with logical long-term organic devel-\nopment. The concerto also builds on Connolly\u2019s\nprevious achievements: the continuous variation\nstructure where a feeling of perpetual transfor-\nmation is created by overlapping variations\nextends his concern with this form in the central\nmovement of his organ concerto Diaphony (1977).\nAlso, the use of on- and off-stage horns as a kind of\nsubconscious entity develops a technique first\nused in Triad IV (1968), where the use of a tape\nallowed a flautist to dialogue with a recorded ver-\nsion of his or her own playing.\nIn the world premi\u00e8re performance, Nicholas\nHodges grasped the hugely demanding solo part\nwith flair and intuitive understanding based on a\nlong and fruitful association with the composer,\nwhilst the BBC Symphony Orchestra, under the\nalert direction of David Porcelijn, got to the heart\nof this complex but closely argued score. I hope\nthis consummately crafted new concerto will ini-\ntiate a rapprochement between Connolly and\norchestral writing \u2013 such is the effectiveness of the\nscoring that one longs for more large-scale works\nfrom this technically searching but directly expres-\nsive composer.\nPaul Conway\nMunich: \u2018Musica Rediviva\u2019\nAt least one institution of Germany\u2019s contempo-\nrary music scene looks likely to survive the\ngovernment\u2019s current austerity schemes:\nMunich\u2019s Musica Viva series. The second concert\nof its 2003\u20134 season, held in Hercules Hall on 7\nNovember, remained true to the great tradition of\nthis venerable series by treating a packed auditori-\num to two world premi\u00e8res and the first German\nperformance of a \u2018modern classic\u2019. Presiding at\nthe rostrum with the Bavarian RSO was Musica\nViva\u2019s current director Udo Zimmermann, him-\nself a composer of note and an open-minded\nchampion of the pan-European avantgarde. In a\ntalk broadcast in the interval, Zimmermann\nemphasized the series\u2019 new alignment on co-oper-\native ventures with other state broadcasting\ncompanies, specifically in France and the Baltic\ncountries. Besides allowing radio orchestras to\npool their straitened resources, this tactic also has\nthe highly desirable advantage of giving further\nhearings to new works after their premi\u00e8res. The\nsize and attentiveness of Zimmermann\u2019s audi-\nences suggest that he has found the right tack to\nsteer Musica Viva out of its doldrums of previous\ndecades and through the cost-slashings of the new\nmillennium.\nThe evening also witnessed the presentation of\nthe Third BMW Composition Prize to Valerio\nSannicandro, a 32-year-old Italian composer-con-\nductor whose award-winning strali (2002\u20133)\nopened the concert. This year\u2019s prize called for the\nuse of a solo voice and electronics, both of which\naccordingly bulked large in Sannicandro\u2019s new\nwork. As the Rumanian soprano Monica Jordan\nsang syllabified fragments from Michelangelo\nsonnets, a background sampler (operated by\nMelvyn Poore) fed in pre-recorded excerpts of\ncontemporary pop songs to create what the com-\nposer calls a \u2018double concerto\u2019 for two disparate\nages and cultural spheres \u2013 an idea he attributes to\nhis reading of Umberto Eco\u2019s Lector in fabula. In\nthe event, the sampler blended seamlessly into the\nrichly varied timbres of the full orchestra, leaving\nthe soprano in the foreground with a full panoply\nof contemporary vocal techniques. Strali thus\nproves to be less a multi-cultural pastiche than a\npoised and timbrally luxuriant essay in the tradi-\ntion of York H\u00f6ller and Helmut Lachenmann,\nperhaps with a distant nod to Berio\u2019s Circles.\nFollowing the interval and the official presenta-\ntion of the BMW Prize, the audience was\nconfronted with a work of radically different hue:\nExeo, Solo No. 5 (2002), jointly commissioned by\nMusica Viva and Radio France from the French\ncomposer Pascal Dusapin. Viscous, slow-moving,\nhighly abstract, Exeo proved to be a sustained exer-\ncise in semitone motion and tonal allusion (the\ncomposer has referred to its opening section as a\n\u2018sort of decelerated, undulating trill\u2019). As the semi-\ntone textures congeal into dense Klangfl\u00e4chen,\nisolated instruments flare forth in ever-wider\nintervals, adding new layers of tension and materi-\nal as the piece gravitates toward its concluding\nA-flat minor triad. Exeo is said to owe much basic\nmaterial to its predecessor Extenso, Solo No. 2, from\nwhich its very title would seem to derive, but spiri-\ntually its true forebear is the \u2018changing chord\u2019 of\nSchoenberg\u2019s op. 15, no. 3.\nTo turn to Anders Eliasson\u2019s Symphony No. 3\n(1989) is to enter a diametrically opposed musical\nuniverse. It is perhaps too convenient to slot\nEliasson into the Scandinavian symphonic tradi-\ntion and claim Sibelius and Petterson as his\nspiritual godfathers, but there is no mistaking the\nnarrative impetus behind this \u2018modern classic\u2019,\nthe very titles of whose five movements (Cerca,\nSolitudine, Fremiti, L\u00fagubre and Nebbie) outline an\ninterior drama. Eliasson\u2019s Third Symphony was\ncommissioned and premi\u00e8red by the noted alto\nsaxophonist John-Edward Kelly, who duly\nreceived in return a solo part worthy of a 19th-\ncentury virtuoso. Although Zimmermann calls it\na \u2018primus inter pares\u2019, the saxophone dominates\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 67\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthe piece in the sheer length and difficulty of its\npart. Eliasson\u2019s music is basically linear in concep-\ntion; the background textures are always rich and\nallusive, casting up motifs that \u2018infect\u2019 each other\nin the time-honoured manner of the narrative\nsymphony and generating a formidable rhythmic\nmomentum that may well bespeak the compos-\ner\u2019s apprentice years as a jazz musician. The\nwork\u2019s rich emotionality left the audience thor-\noughly impressed, and Kelly, who has made a\nspeciality of this piece over the years, acknowl-\nedged his dominant role by playing a solo encore to\nround off an evening as diverse as it was satisfying.\nJ. Bradford Robinson\nLondon, Wigmore Hall: Maxwell Davies\u2019s new\n\u2018Naxos Quartets\u2019 (and earlier works on CD)\nIn a project that will be completed in 2007, Sir\nPeter Maxwell Davies has been commissioned by\nthe Naxos recording company to write ten string\nquartets.  Large-scale ambitions already realized,\nthe intimacy of chamber music offers an opportu-\nnity not only to consolidate but also to probe and\nquest with the precision of scaled-down forces. It\nis timely, then, to be reminded that, although it has\nnot been a major preoccupation such as opera,\nconcerto and symphony writing, the quartet form\nhas drawn from him some significant examples\nevincing an original approach. A recent Metier\nrelease usefully gathers together on one disc all\nMax\u2019s works for string quartet prior to the Naxos\nseries.2 In these persuasive recordings, the mem-\nbers of the Kreutzer Quartet display a keen\nunderstanding of the individual character of each\npiece, the circumstances of its creation and the\npurpose for which it was intended.\n\u2018Quartet Movement\u2019, dating from 1952, is a stu-\ndent work, and the earliest published piece in the\nMaxwell Davies canon. A lone surviving sketch\nfrom a larger composition, this feisty fragment is\nfull of interest. Its driving, ostinato-fuelled energy\nand rich fusion of Medieval, Western classical and\nIndian musical traditions reveal Max\u2019s preoccupa-\ntions at that time and also presage future stylistic\ndevelopments. \nThe starting-point of his String Quartet (1961)\nwas Monteverdi\u2019s Vespers of 1610, a particularly\nfruitful stimulus which also resulted in the\nLeopardi Fragments (1961) and the Sinfonia for\norchestra (1962). The intensely weaving opening\nAdagio shows the influence of Mahler as much as\nmedieval music. The sequence of ensuing faster\nsections shed ever-shifting light on the Adagio\u2019s\nmaterial. The Kreutzer Quartet\u2019s performance\nshows they have the measure of this profound,\nconcentrated 12-minute study.  \nThe Two Little Quartets for \u2018young string quar-\ntet\u2019 were written in 1980 and 1977 (revised 1987)\nrespectively. The first is in three movements. An\nelusive meditation for first violin is followed by a\nscherzo, contrasting a stormy climax and\nOrcadian calm. The Finale\u2019s opening elegy\nreturns to the serene theme of the previous move-\nment, ultimately transformed into a lament. The\ncompact one-movement second quartet is less\nserious in tone, attaining simplicity with sub-\nstance. Both of these Little Quartets are adroit\ncompressions of full-scale works, composed for\namateurs, but rewarding musicianship of the\nhighest quality, as demonstrated in the Kreutzers\u2019\nsincere, considered performances.\nThe world premi\u00e8re of Max\u2019s latest addition to\nthe repertoire \u2013 the Naxos Quartet No. 3 \u2013 took\nplace in the Wigmore Hall in October 2003.\nBefore the Maggini Quartet (for whom all the\nNaxos quartets have been written) unveiled the\nnew work, the composer addressed the audience,\nleaving no doubt as to the political dimension of\nthe piece, which was written in March and April\n2003. Referring to the US and British invasion of\nIraq, he stated that it was a \u2018privilege\u2019 and a \u2018duty\u2019\nto comment on \u2018one of the greatest disasters of\nour time\u2019 and \u2018the worst foreign policy move this\ncountry has made for 100 years\u2019 \u2013 remarks which\nelicited hearty applause. Such a passionate expres-\nsion of belief was reminiscent of the young\nmaverick who wrote such subversive works as\nAntechrist, Eight Songs for a Mad King and Vesalii\nIcones. Anger and outrage have boiled over into\nthe quartet, which has the same hot blood cours-\ning through its veins as those electrifying works\nfrom the late 1960s.  \nAnguished unrest characterizes the opening\nAllegro section of the first movement. The materi-\nal curdles into a pompous and empty military\nmarch before ending in wearied resignation. The\nfollowing movement is a piercing anti-war\nlament, based on the \u2018In Nomine\u2019 plainsong, and\ncompellingly poignant to a degree that matches\nthe raw intensity Max achieved in his potent\nWorldes Blis from 1969. At one point, the violins\ntake up the open-ended argument left from the\nclose of the first Naxos Quartet \u2013 there, it dissipated\ninto the stratosphere, whereas here, its descent\nsignals the advent of a wilfully distorted version of\nthe \u2018In Nomine\u2019 theme.

The\ncourageous display of open, personal feeling in\nthis shattering movement left the audience both\ndevastated and palpably moved.  \nThe \u2018Four Inventions and a Hymn\u2019 which fol-\nlow, takes the form of an ironic scherzo, in which\nthe queasy concluding hymn, marked stucchevole\n(cloying), is a direct descendant of the sanctimo-\nnious pseudo-religious chants featured in the\nopera Resurrection. In the context of the Iraq\ninvasion, it is not hard to see whose self-righteous\nsanctimony Max is mocking. \nThe final \u2018Fugue\u2019 juxtaposes emotionally\nexhausted passages with violent fortissimo thrusts.\nThere is ambiguity in the title of this last move-\nment, which begins with a Largo in traditional\nfugal style, with instruments entering consecu-\ntively, but quickly turns in a rout-like Allegro flight\n(from the Italian \u2018fuga\u2019). The quartet ends accus-\ningly, with empty jabbing chords jolting the music\ninto a soured silence, perhaps the composer\u2019s per-\nsonal reproach to those who choose not to see or\nhear the truth.\nProgrammed after so emotionally draining a\nwork, the Second Naxos Quartet, finished in\nJanuary 2003, risked being an anti-climax to the\nconcert, yet the piece\u2019s structural strength and\nintellectual toughness ensured no such disap-\npointment. The Maggini Quartet tackled both\nworks with the utmost commitment and some-\nthing approaching missionary zeal: the players\nseemed convinced these are no ordinary pieces.\nThe imaginative scoring, structural ingenuity and\nblazing conviction in these quartets are such that it\nis highly probable they will regularly grace cham-\nber concerts in the future.\nAn ideal medium for personal expression, the\nstring quartet has inspired Sir Maxwell Davies to\nproduce some his most emotionally involving and\ndirectly expressive utterances. The three Naxos\nQuartets so far composed are amongst the most\nwarmly eloquent and technically impressive\nrecent examples of the genre.

Conversely\none hears of The Departure of the Queen of Sheba,\nand other novelties. However, when conductor\nGeorge Vass, musical director of the Presteigne\nFestival, commissioned three modern preludes to\nHandel\u2019s Messiah,to celebrate his tenth anniver-\nsary at the festival (2002), this must  qualify as a\n\u2019first\u2019, and his brainchild. The Presteigne Festival\nis well known for its commitment to contempo-\nrary classical music. This was an ideal opportu-\nnity to commission three major British\ncomposers, to make their own 21st century\n\u2018commentaries\u2019 on Messiah, using the same\ninstrumental forces available to Handel. As he\nalso directs St Albans Choral Society, they put on\nthe Messiah 25 October 2003, at St Albans\nCathedral, prefaced by the three new preludes in\nthe presence of two of the composers, Cecilia\nMcDowall and David Matthews, using Orchestra\nNova from the Presteigne Festival. \nThe cathedral acoustics enhanced the\nperformance considerably, with two distant\ntrumpets proclaiming from the gallery high\nabove the altar by the organ loft in Cecilia\nMcDowall\u2019s short opening Prelude to Part One,\nspecially written to blend seamlessly with\nHandel\u2019s own orchestral introduction to his\noratorio. McDowall used the opening three notes\nof the initial solo from the countertenor, which\nare also the same as the opening for the chorus in\nboth \u2018And he shall purify\u2019 and \u2018O Thou that tellest\ngood tidings\u2019 to good effect for the trumpet solos\nwith orchestration. \n\u2018I thought the choir were terrific\u2019, said Cecilia\nMcDowall after the concert. \u2018The whole perform-\nance had great sense of direction and drive. It all\ncame across with great clarity \u2013 the most effective\nperformance (with the new preludes) so far\u2019. I too\nwas actually quite surprised by the high standard\nachieved by our local St Albans Choral Society,\nand I\u2019m sure it had a lot to do with the excitement\nand \u2018buzz\u2019 of being prefaced by three exciting new\nPreludes by leading living composers, two of\nwhom were present in the audience. \nJohn McCabe\u2019s \u2018Shepherd\u2019s Dream\u2019, prelude \nto Messiah Part Two, was atmospheric, featuring\ndescending episodes for woodwind, with\ntrumpet themes from within the orchestra,\nrather than from afar. In his programme notes\nMcCabe writes: \n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f70\nI chose to draw on the opening theme of \u2018He shall feed\nhis flock\u2019, towards the end of Part One of the\nMessiah,and its close relative,the opening theme of\n\u2018Behold the Lamb of God\u2019with which Part Two com-\nmences, and therefore to write a sort of counterpoint\nto the Pastoral Symphony of Part One. I made no\nattempt to emulate Handel\u2019s style, feeling in awe of his\ngreat artistry and individuality. I did however examine\nthe tonal structure of the work, and attempted to make\na link between the B flat area of the end of Part One\nand the G minor with which Part Two begins. \nDavid Matthews\u2019s Prelude to Messiah Part\nThree, a short 15-bar meditation, Molto Adagio,\nends with trumpet calls from the gallery playing\n\u2018fragments from the Hallelujah chorus, in D\nmajor, over B flat major\/G minor harmonies\n(keys prominent in Part Two) and an abrupt mod-\nulation to B major in preparation for the E major\nof \u201cI know that my Redeemer Liveth\u201d, which\nopens Part Three\u2019, to quote from his programme\nnotes. In conversation after the concert he con-\nveyed the fact that unless the transition from his\nPrelude to the commencement of Part Three is\nseamless, the carefully planned modulatory\nscheme of his prelude can lose impact. \nIn fact my only criticism of these three carefully\nconstructed, innovative preludes is that for full\nimpact they need perhaps some reinforcement\nallowing for greater emphasis of the strategic\nmodulatory ideas so that the crucial lead-in chords\nremain in the ear of discerning members of the\naudience long enough to connect with their reso-\nlution on Handel\u2019s immortal harmonies ahead,\nfor which they are but the preface. Perhaps a bit\nless \u2018self-effacement\u2019 and awe by our modern\ncomposers would also help here so that the audi-\nence can latch onto something a bit more meaty\nand less fragmentry. But this was a noteworthy\ncontribution in the quest for performances of\n\u2018Messiah with a difference\u2019.\nJill Barlow\nLondon, Barbican: Vaughan Williams rarities\nFilm music, often considered a \u2018Cinderella\u2019 art-\nform, is really more of a \u2018Sleeping Beauty\u2019: to a\n\u2018first approximation\u2019, its entire history exists on\nfilms which we are never shown. Prefatory to the\n2003 Musicians Benevolent Fund Royal Concert\non 4 November, however, the Barbican cinema\npresented an early-evening resuscitation of no\nfewer than four long-dormant items connected in\nsome way with Vaughan Williams, two of whose\norchestral works were programmed to follow.\nThe screening began with London Can Take It!\n(1940; dir. Humphrey Jennings and Harry Watt), the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nOscar-nominated 9-minute exercise in \u2018docu-ganda\u2019\nwhich (with its script written and spoken by New\nYork-born journalist Quentin Reynolds) was evi-\ndently an attempt to interest a resolutely isolationist\nUS population in Britain\u2019s desperate plight. The film\nis never listed among those scored by Vaughan\nWilliams (whose first accredited cinematic project\nwas Michael Powell\u2019s 49th Parallel [1941]) \u2013 and this\nscreening demonstrated why: the tiny amount of\nmusic in it (no more than 25 seconds at the start, and\nless than 10 seconds at the close) is all \u2018lifted\u2019 from\nthe beginning and end of the first Maestoso alla mar-\ncia in the finale of the London Symphony. In the\ncircumstances, I am inclined not to impute any par-\nticular expressive or symbolic intention to the fact\nthat the overall film-musical structure thus starts\nwith a tune in mixolydian C, and ends with whole-\ntone ascent to a chord of G major.\nNext, it was The Dim Little Island (1949; dir.\nHumphrey Jennings), an 11-minute meditation \u2013\non post-war Britain\u2019s past, present and (uncertain)\nfuture \u2013 whose preoccupations Polonius might\nhave described as \u2018historical-social-industrial-nat-\nural-musical\u2019; but which in execution merely\nadded a straightforward visual back-drop to some\nconfusingly juxtaposed and inter-cut off-camera\nmusings by four narrators, Vaughan Williams\namong them. For me at least, this composer\u2019s lov-\ning description of British musical life \u2013 its wartime\nrenascence, its various professional and amateur\n\u2018layers\u2019, and its ultimate underpinning by the\n\u2018great tunes\u2019 of folksong \u2013 constituted the only\nworthwhile part of the experience: elsewhere, an\ninsufferable condescension and stifling concern\nwith national unity and purpose often held sway\n(industrialist John Ormiston\u2019s Words To The\nNation, for example, included the pronunciamento\nthat \u2018we need more work from below, and more\ndrive from the top\u2019. And Britain\u2019s future was hope-\nful, we were told, because \u2018we are good sailors\u2019!).\nAs for the score, this too has to be reckoned a \nqualified disappointment \u2013 though one which\ncannot be passed over so briefly.\nFor a start, there is what turns out to be the\nerroneous picture presented by the VW \u2018litera-\nture\u2019. Michael Kennedy\u2019s catalogue, for example,\ntells us the following:\nThe music consisted [sic] of a short prelude based on\ntwo folk songs, one of which is \u2018Pretty Betsy\u2019 and the\nother \u2018The Pride of Kildare\u2019, both from Vaughan\nWilliams\u2019s manuscript collection. A folk singer sings\n\u2018Dives and Lazarus\u2019 unaccompanied, and the statement\nof the tune from the Five Variants is used as back-\nground.3\nOn the evidence of the present screening, this\ndescription requires wholesale revision. First,\nKennedy short-changes the most ingenious and\nimaginative gesture on the soundtrack: the \u2018folk\nsinger\u2019 presents merely the first two lines of \u2018Dives\nand Lazarus\u2019 \u2013 and as these proceed, a splendid\npiece of sound-editing allows the gradual \u2018fading\nup\u2019 of an orchestral continuation of the tune in the\nform of the corresponding juncture in Vaughan\nWilliams\u2019s Five Variants of \u2018Dives and Lazarus\u2019\n(1939). (As it happens, the instrumental entry is\nsome distance away from the singer\u2019s pitch; but\nyou can\u2019t have everything\u2026). \nSecondly, at every other point in the body of the\nfilm, the music is also taken from the Five Variants \u2013\nand not all from a \u2018statement of the tune\u2019 either:\nwe hear slabs of Variants II and V in addition.\nThirdly, quite what became of \u2018Pretty Betsy\u2019\nand \u2018The Pride of Kildare\u2019 I cannot say; but what\nthe eminently preludial music heard over the\n\u2018titles\u2019 actually presented us with was a fleeting\nreference to \u2018Dives and Lazarus\u2019 in the form of\na transposed (from B to E) version of the last, con-\ncluding statement of the four-chord \u2018signature\nprogression\u2019 of the Five Variants4 \u2013 and, emerging\nfrom its final (E major) chord, a twofold presenta-\ntion of \u2018The Bold Young Farmer\u2019, familiar as the\ntune of the \u20182nd fiddler\u2019 in Old King Cole (1923) but\nheard here in a different arrangement.\nNow, if one is correct in suspecting that this\narrangement too was drawn from a pre-existing\nwork (and the fact that it featured the only appear-\nance of a clarinet in the entire soundtrack certainly\nencourages this suspicion), then it is the case that\nthe film contains nothing that required the com-\nposer to contribute anything other than his\npermission: such basic \u2018joinery\u2019 as the score dis-\nplays could have been done entirely by \u2018other\nparties\u2019 (perhaps the music\u2019s conductor \u2013 \u2018proba-\nbly\u2019 John Hollingsworth, according to Kennedy).5\nIf this was in fact the case, then we have perhaps\nexplained three rather remarkable facts: first, that\nthe British Library possesses no manuscript of a\nscore connected with the film; secondly, that\nKennedy\u2019s catalogue makes no reference to the\nexistence or whereabouts of such a manuscript;\nand, thirdly, that the composer is known to have\ndenied that he ever composed a score for this film.6\nStructurally speaking too, the film contains noth-\ning that leads one to suspect the direct\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 71\n3 Michael Kennedy, A Catalogue of the Works of Ralph Vaughan\nWilliams (2nd ed., Oxford, 1996), p.188.\n4 The progression\u2019s 5^ \u2013 \u00026^ \u2013 \u00027^ \u2013 5^ \u2018top line\u2019 derives, of course,\nfrom the tune\u2019s four highest notes.\n5 Michael Kennedy, A Catalogue of the Works of Ralph Vaughan\nWilliams (2nd ed., Oxford, 1996), p.188.\n6 See Michael Kennedy, A Catalogue of the Works of Ralph Vaughan\nWilliams (2nd ed., Oxford, 1996), pp.188\u2013189, or Musical Times,\nVol.97, No.1356 (Feb. 1956), 89, and No.1357 (Mar. 1956), 147.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ninvolvement of a great composer: while one notes\nthat its final words (\u2018Who could talk of an end,\nwhen we\u2019re scarcely at the beginning?\u2019) are quite\nniftily accompanied by the same gesture heard at\nthe very start, the apparent attempt to further\nreinforce the speaker\u2019s optimistic, \u2018forward-look-\ning\u2019 message by engineering a subtly \u2018open\u2019\nending \u2013 via an overall shift from E to B \u2013 is fatally\nundermined by the fact that everything in the body\nof the film has happened in that same (modal) B.\nIn short, then, one feels that there is quite literally\nevery reason to argue that The Dim Little Island\nshould be removed from the roster of \u2018films\nscored by Vaughan Williams\u2019: so far, it seems to\nhave as little right to be on his work-list as Brief\nEncounter would on Rachmaninov\u2019s.\nAfter two such disappointments, it was refresh-\ning indeed to encounter something in which\nVaughan Williams\u2019s personal involvement was\nobvious and genuine throughout: Edgar Anstey\u2019s\n2-minute reel showing VW at Beaconsfield\nStudios for the recording ( January 1956) of his\nscore for The England of Elizabeth (composed\nAutumn 1955). This was, of course, the occasion\nwhen \u2013 so the story goes \u2013 VW\u2019s chair tipped back-\nwards off the platform and Anstey, fortunately\nstanding behind, caught him and quite possibly\nsaved his life. Regrettably or not, no such adven-\nture was seen on the film. Instead, we observed\nthe great man listening to his own music; con-\nferring with conductor John Hollingsworth\n(replacement for an indisposed Muir Mathieson);\nand turning over a page of score whose author-\nship was inferable from the size of the ink-blot\nvisible on it. The only unfortunate feature of the\nclip was that it had not been left \u2018authentically\u2019\nsilent (or even matched with something from\neither of the two works drawn from the score\nbeing played),7 but instead had had a wildly inap-\npropriate segment of the Sixth Symphony\u2019s\nmalefic scherzo dubbed onto it: I don\u2019t believe I\nwas being over-fastidious in finding it a dislocating\nexperience to have a composer obviously in his\nmid-80s sitting in a studio audibly accompanied by\na piece written in his mid-70s and visibly in the\npresence of an orchestra that wasn\u2019t playing it and\na conductor who never recorded it.\nHappily, the \u2018absent\u2019 score was not long in\narriving \u2013 since the session ended with a rare\nscreening of The England of Elizabeth (1957; dir.\nJohn Taylor). Combining an informative discus-\nsion of the Elizabethan age with an attractively\n(colour-) photographed survey of the visible, \nsurviving heritage of Tudor England, this award-\nwinning, 26-minute documentary for the British\nTransport Commission boasted a splendidly liter-\nate script by Gloucestershire novelist John Moore,\nresonantly delivered by Shakespearian actor Alec\nClunes. And there, of course, is the rub: over and\nover again, continuous music clashed with\nomnipresent speaker \u2013 with the words permitted\nto triumph by sheer force of \u2018mixing level\u2019 over a\nscore of real interest and attractiveness (and\nwhich, like so much of VW\u2019s most substantial film\nmusic, was written \u2018apart from\u2019 the film, and the\nfootage edited to fit\u2026). Even so, enough was dis-\ncernible for one to be able to tell that this score\nwas composed in the same creative breath as the\nEighth Symphony (1953\u201355; rev. 1956): besides\ndetails of spacing and scoring (including subtle\nbut telling contributions from the vibraphone),\nthat trumpet-and-drum ritornello (with its 1^ \u2013 3^\u2013\n#4^ \u2013 5^ opening shape) could almost have been the\n\u2018Galliard of the Sons of the Morning\u2019 (from Job\n[1927\u201330]) refracted through the prism of the new\nsymphony\u2019s finale. One might also \u2013 in an age of\npost-modern quotation-compulsion and self-\nreferentiality \u2013 draw attention to an example of\nfilm-compositional self-restraint: the reading from\nthe \u2018Book of Job\u2019 was not accompanied by any\n\u2018deeds of narcissism made audible\u2019, nor in fact by\nany music at all; but saw the composer withdraw\nentirely \u2013 so as to allow the ostensible \u2018Word of\nGod\u2019 to be heard in silence.\nAnd so, after a decent pause for reflection and\nrefreshment, it was on to the Barbican\u2019s concert\nhall for the Musicians Benevolent Fund Royal\nConcert and those VW works \u2013 \u2018two important\nworks\u2019, according to the Chairman of the MBF;\n\u2018two works \u2026 that have not been performed in\npublic for many years\u2019, in the words of the LSO\u2019s\nManaging Director; and at least one of them a\nwork which, after a few early outings, \u2018lay unpub-\nlished and unperformed\u2019, as the Chairman of the\nRVW Society put it.\nFrom which splendidly tantalizing copy one\nwould hardly guess that neither work, strictly speak-\ning, had any business being on the programme.

World\u2019s gone mad.\nMark Doran\nLondon, St John\u2019s Smith Square: \nMalcolm Singer at 50\nFor a composer to be able to have a fiftieth birth-\nday concert of his own music is an achievement,\nbut to have those works performed with dedica-\ntion and enthusiasm by a host of different choirs,\nensembles and soloists, including many children,\nstudents, as well as colleagues, and enjoyed by a\ncapacity crowd, is an even greater tribute.\nMalcolm Singer\u2019s 50th Birthday Concert on 13\nOctober 2003 was just such an occasion, featuring\nas it did a world premi\u00e8re and second perform-\nance, in a programme that spanned from an early\ngraduation work to recent choral and instrumen-\ntal commissions. What emerged was a stylistic\nthread and aesthetic integrity, a predilection for\nquasi-minimalist processes, energetic rhythmic\npolyphony, and a keen sense of expressive shape\nthat gives Singer a unique place in the pantheon of\npostmodernism. Above all the works radiated a\npractical expertise that derives from Singer\u2019s expe-\nrience as an all-round musician. Currently\nDirector of Music at the Yehudi Menuhin School,\nSurrey, he is an accomplished conductor and\nteacher who has produced a large oeuvre in\nalmost every genre, including children\u2019s music. \nThe world premi\u00e8re was a pithy set of Four\nMiniatures for male choir to poems by Micheline\nWandor (librettist for Singer\u2019s Cantata York), sung\nwith enthusiasm by the Weybridge Male Voice\nChoir. Quasi-chorale phrases lent humour to the\nfirst song, \u2018Crafty\u2019, contrasted by misty evocation\nin \u2018A poem for Dawn\u2019 and characteristic sugges-\ntions of slow motion in \u2018Hell\u2019 before the rapping\nstaccato strands of \u2018Music will out\u2019. More serious\nin tone was Singer\u2019s Piano Trio, here given its sec-\nond performance, following the previous week\u2019s\nWigmore Hall premi\u00e8re, by Dimension, for\nwhom it was composed. The central section of\nthis tripartite work is a recomposition of the\nScherzo from Singer\u2019s 1986 Piano Sonata, a type of\nmoto perpetuo in which the piano\u2019s boogie-style\nostinato forms an insistent backdrop to syncopat-\ned stabbing strings sounds. Singer framed this\nwith an eerie Prelude with unusual chord spacings\nand a racy Epilogue which nevertheless concludes\nin expansively lyrical mode.\nSinger\u2019s is a purposeful and original style, often\nusing means of utmost simplicity and restraint to\nachieve eloquent goals. This was evident in the two\nsolo works performed here, both dedicated to\ninfluential mentors and colleagues, Franco\nDonatoni and Yehudi Menuhin. The Menuhin\nSchool student Ellena Hale gave a brilliant account\nof Franco\u2019s Gone \u2013 Gifts of Tones, a Park Lane com-\nmission in 2000 in memory of Franco Donatoni,\nwith whom Singer studied. It is a Ligeti-esque\nstudy in quartal harmony, rapidly alternating\nchords fluttering around contrasting registers with\nplenty of pregnant silences and a middle section of\nrippling cascades of notes. The Elegy for solo violin\nwas composed for the funeral of Yehudi Menuhin\nat the Menuhin School, and features a poignant\npizzicato repeated D which casts a dirge-like shad-\now over each melodic phrase. Yet this falling minor\nscale, appearing in different forms, gradually\nreaches a peak of intensity, where a quotation from\nErnest Bloch\u2019s Avodah, the first work that compos-\ner wrote for Menuhin, injects a soulful yearning\nbefore the piece finds its point of rest. \nIn Singer\u2019s larger choral and chamber works it\nis the rhythmic impetus and energy which are\nmost marked, and especially in the riveting pulsat-\ning colours and patterns of the early 1984 Nonet.\nThe performance, by an alert young ensemble led\nby Valeriy Sokolov, was a tour de force with the\n9 My own solution to the problem of how to enjoy the rather\nfine \u2018full length\u2019 scherzo (with its remarkable \u2018second trio\u2019)\nwithout either endangering the successful parts of the wider\nstructure or having to endure the disastrous rest is quite simple:\nplay this \u2018original version\u2019 of the scherzo as a single movement on\nits own!\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 73\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthree groups of three violins, violas and cellos\ncombined and pitted against each other in myriad\ntextures, shimmering cluster chords and peak\npitches sustained, sometimes in harmonics, across\nthe ensemble. With its dramatic interjections and\nnovel sonorities, somewhere between buzzing bees\nand racing cars, relentless textural repetition and\nevolution from which soloistic gestures take flight,\nthe work is an inspired masterpiece of its medium. \nIt was especially inspiring to witness the dedica-\ntion of pupils and teachers in Singer\u2019s works for\nchildren. Pupils at the Primary St Mary\u2019s School,\nLong Ditton and the Menuhin School played\nFantasia on Yehudi\u2019s Theme, part of a community\noriented project. The theme in question is a simple\ndiatonic scale motif, which was subjected to some\ningenious transformations by the larger, more\nadvanced group in counterpoint to the open\nstrings of the younger group. The result was a\nvibrant resonance with a Riverdance feel to it. Songs\nfrom Dragons, settings of poems by Nick Toczek \u2013\nconducted with flair by Keith Willis, Surrey\u2019s\n\u2018Head of Culture\u2019 - who commissioned the piece in\n1997, further affirmed Singer\u2019s gift for music and\nyouth. Children from Surrey Arts sang the simple\nmelodies of three songs with gusto, encouraged to\na dragonish scream as final flourish. \nA witty highlight of the evening was the virtu-\nsoso rendition of \u2018Fugue\u2019, a Singer graduation\npiece from 1974, by four senior faculty members of\nthe Menuhin School  \u2013 with its self-analysis of fugal\nform. The performance of Two Psalms by the\nZemel Choir (which Singer conducted for ten\nyears) rounded off the concert and underscored an\nimportant aspect of Singer\u2019s style \u2013 his deep\ninvolvement and exploration of his Jewish heritage\nin music, evident in several Hebrew settings and\nworks on Jewish topics. Conducted by Benjamin\nWolf, the smooth sustained undulating strands of\nPsalm 100 contrasted well with the buoyant\nrhythms of Psalm 117, pulsating ostinati combined\nwith smooth lyrical melodies which evolve unpre-\ndictably, yet with necessity. It is that evolution\nwhich makes Singer\u2019s music so fascinating to fol-\nlow. The concert highlighted the extent to which\nhis works share a uniquely dynamic energy, econo-\nmy of means and originality of effect, qualities\nwhich are constantly renewed and re-explored in\neach work. It is a process, one hopes, that will con-\ntinue to evolve in conception and performance\nthrough the next half century, and beyond. \nMalcolm Miller\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f74\nMUSIC OF TODAY\nAdmission free - no ticket required!\nsupported\nby the RPS\nSteve Martland\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tihanyi\nThursday 6 May - Royal Festival Hall, 6.00pm\nA portrait of Steve Martland \nMartyn Brabbins conductor\nThursday 27 May - Royal Festival Hall, 6.00pm\nMusic by Gyula Csap\u00f3, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tihanyi, Bal\u00e1zs Horv\u00e1th \nBaldur Br\u00f6nnimann guest conductor\nThursday 17 June - Royal Festival Hall, 6.00pm\nIntimate Letters - new music by young composers\nClark Rundell guest conductor\nThis performance will be repeated at the Bedford Corn Exchange on\nWednesday 23 June at 6.00pm.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLondon, Wigmore Hall: Erik Chisholm and\nRonald Stevenson \nMurray McLachlan\u2019s premi\u00e8re of Erik Chisholm\u2019s\nSonata in A minor on 4 January marked the cente-\nnary of Chisholm\u2019s birth (in Cathcart, outside\nGlasgow) to the day itself. Chisholm was a consid-\nerable force for good while he was busy in Scotland:\nthe first British performances of Les Troyens,\nB\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and Idomeneo; visits to his \u2018Active\nSociety for the Propagation of Contemporary\nMusic\u2019 in Glasgow from Bart\u00f3k, Casella, Schmitt,\nSorabji (a close friend), Szymanowski and other\nluminaries. But he could, apparently, be a difficult\nman, and with his posting to Singapore by ENSA in\n1943, to conduct the Singapore Symphony\nOrchestra, and subsequent nomination to the chair\nof the music department of the University of Cape\nTown in 1946, his native land seems to have been\ncontent to forget the outsized personality whom\nArnold Bax called \u2018the most progressive composer\nthat Scotland has produced\u2019.\nChisholm\u2019s Sonata in A, An Riobain Dearg (\u2018The\nRed Ribbon\u2019), suggests that some radical re-assess-\nment is required. It was composed in 1939 but\nconsidered incomplete until investigation in Cape\nTown last year by his daughter Morag turned up\nthe missing pages. It turns out to be a major work,\nalmost 40 minutes in length \u2013 although all four\nmovements outstay their welcome, a fault I\u2019ve\nnoticed in some of the few other Chisholm works\nI\u2019ve been able to hear. Yet there\u2019s an essentiality in\nthis piece which redeems its composer\u2019s prolixity.\nThe musical language is dark and intense, sitting\nhalfway between Bart\u00f3k and Sorabji, its impor-\ntance as a specifically Scottish piano sonata being\nits integration of pibroch and Gaelic melody into\na concert work: Chisholm was doing in Scotland\nexactly what Bart\u00f3k had done in Hungary. The\nfirst movement, its opening acciaccature instantly\nowning its debt to the music of the pipes, develops\ninto a proud and fierce fantasy of craggy strength,\nthe sparse harmonies gradually filling out as the\nmusic evolves; as with pibroch, too, this is music of\nconstant ornamentation, which gives it an impro-\nvisatory, elusive quality. The scherzo, placed\nsecond, is a quicksilver Bart\u00f3kian toccata, super-\nimposing hobgoblin anger over a boogie-woogie\nbass. The third-movement \u2018Lament\u2019, inspired by\nthe loss of the submarine Thetis in June 1939, mov-\ningly extends a terse, fragmented right-hand\nthrenody over aqueous chords in the left hand; a\npowerful, hymnic chordal sequence rises out of\nswirling textures which return to reclaim their\nprize in an atmosphere of unashamed, Stygian\ngloom. The finale dances with defiant humour,\nagain evoking Hebrides and Highlands (and at one\npoint anticipating Peter Grimes); lyrical consolation\nsuffuses one episode, but the grim jollity comes\nstomping back, ending the work in a mood of tri-\numphant, splenetic optimism. \nThe other premi\u00e8re in McLachlan\u2019s pro-\ngramme was of Ronald Stevenson\u2019s Threepenny\nSonatina (his Sonatina No. 5), written in 1987\nthough intermittently revised until as late as\nDecember last year. Stevenson, who will just have\nturned 76 when this review is published, became a\ncolleague of Chisholm\u2019s when he took up an\nappointment as lecturer in Cape Town in 1963;\ntypically, Chisholm had him playing in the opera\norchestra on the evening of his arrival.10\nStevenson has been one of the most prolific of\nBritish composers, and part of what William\nWalton called, in a letter, \u2018your obsessive urge to\ncommunicate\u2019 has taken the form of a creative\ninvolvement with the music of composers he\nadmires: van Dieren, Ysa\u00ffe, Bax, Delius,\nGrainger. F. G. Scott, Kilpinen, Gershwin and\nmany more \u2013 there are over 200 such reworkings\n(transcription, variation, decoration, essentializa-\ntion) which often blur the boundary between\n\u2018composer\u2019 and \u2018arranger\u2019. The Threepenny\nSonatina is probably one of the wittiest of these\nscores (though many of the others must contain\nhumour aplenty), opening with a \u2018contrapuntal\ncocktail\u2019 that combines \u2018Mack the Knife\u2019 with\n\u2018Instead of \u2019, pulling in also \u2018Pirate Jenny\u2019 and\ndeveloping what McLachlan\u2019s notes called \u2018a vir-\ntuoso etudette based on the diminution of \u201cMack\nthe Knife\u201d\u2019. A central fughetta muses sadly on part\nof \u2018Pirate Jenny\u2019; and the closing section toys with\n\u2018Mack\u2019 in tango rhythm, adducing the \u2018Ballad of\nImmoral Earnings\u2019 for further fun. Its six minutes\nseemed to be over almost as soon as the music had\nbegun, leaving the impression of enormous learn-\ning crystallized in a flash of relaxed wit.\nThe two premi\u00e8res were framed in a taxing pro-\ngramme that paid tribute to Chisholm\u2019s\nenthusiasms \u2013 Bart\u00f3k, Sorabji, Jan\u00e1c\u02c7ek and Busoni\n(the Fantasia contrappuntistica, no less) \u2013 though\nMcLachlan showed the same muscular energy at\nthe end of the recital as at the beginning. (Indeed,\nthe Bart\u00f3k and Busoni could usefully have been\nless passionately pedalled.) His encores brought\ntwo more Chisholm premi\u00e8res: the second and last\nof the Eleven Scottish Airs, the one a thing of fragile\nbeauty, the other bright with the caustic humour\nthat informs the finale of the Sonata, and both con-\nfirming his extraordinary ability to pin down the\nwild music of the hills in a concert setting.\nMartin Anderson\n10 See \u2018Composer in Interview: Ronald Stevenson \u2013 a Scot in\nEmergent Africa\u2019 in Tempo Vol.57 no.225 ( July 2003), pp.23\u201331\nfor more on his impressions of Chisholm.

In February\n2004 Radio France presented a \u2018retrospective\u2019 of\nhis prolific output as well as the premi\u00e8re of his\nViolin Concerto, a Radio France commission. His\nnew opera, Le Moine Noir, based on Anton\nChekov\u2019s story ,will be premi\u00e8red in May 2005. \nHis \u2018Vox Gallica\u2019 concert at the Royal Academy\nof Music on 12 November included the UK pre-\nmi\u00e8re of works for small ensemble and also for\nsolo piano, largely impressionistic in a typically\nFrench manner but in an entirely 21st-century\nstyle. \u2018I\u2019m often compared to Dutilleux\u2019, he told\nme at the pre-concert talk, and shades of Debussy\nseem to abound in his works rather than the more\nabstract, abrasive approach of, for example,\nBoulez. \nHersant\u2019s Eph\u00e8meres, a cycle of 24 pieces for\npiano, is due to be released on CD. At the RAM\nconcert of this work, five of the pieces received\ntheir UK premi\u00e8re, giving us a taste of the range of\nhis pianistic style. In \u2018Dans l\u2019air du soir\u2019, where \u2018the\nperfume echoes on the evening air\u2019, homage to\nDebussy is unmistakable, with atmospheric over-\ntones and pedal effects, and the ringing of the bell,\nalmost reminiscent of the Angelus. However,\nHersant moves swiftly onto short miniatures\nbased on the travel notes of the 17th-century\nJapanese poet, Basho, with \u2018the Ant\u2019 in cryptic\nstaccato and then \u2018the Heron\u2019, with strident\nchords. These were all imaginatively portrayed by\npianist Anne Lovett. \nThe main work premi\u00e8red at the concert was In\nNomine, scored for one principal cello and six celli,\nand was inspired by the music of the 16th century\nEnglish composer John Taverner, and based on\nthe famous \u2018In Nomine\u2019 chant of the Benedictus.\nThis work had an impressive sense of direction,\nwith well-developed melodic flow and rhythmic\nimpetus, and it was particularly well received by\nthe Academy audience. Hersant mentioned to me\nthat he feels something of an affinity to the music\nof Benjamin Britten, which may well be apparent\nin his operas, but here I could discern something\nof the mystical quality of The Protecting Veil by the\nmodern day John Tavener, if on a more limited\ncanvas. Hersant\u2019s fine definition of melodic line,\ncoupled with his heritage from the French\nImpressionist School, leads to his works having an\naccessibility about them, further enhanced by\nprogrammatic titles or thematic concepts. Maybe\nhis experience as a radio producer in France has\nkept him well in touch with the supply and\ndemand of his public. \nDue to the last-minute indisposition of the\nyoung conductor, Jean Louis Gosselin, (he broke\nhis hand in an accident a few hours before the con-\ncert), the UK premi\u00e8re of Hersant\u2019s Lebenslauf for\nsoprano and instrumental ensemble had to be\npostponed for a future occasion. Solo cellist\nKatherine Jenkinson,led the ensemble of celli in In\nNomine, sans conductor.\nJill Barlow\nLondon, Royal Academy of Music, \nPe\u00afteris Vasks Piano Quartet\nLatvian Independence Day, 18 November (com-\nmemorating the day 85 years ago when Latvia\nproclaimed its independence from Russia), was\nmarked in London by a mini-concert in the Royal\nAcademy of Music: a handful of Romantic songs\nby Emils Da\u00afrzin\u201as\u201a delivered in the rich bass voice of\nPauls Putnins\u201a and the first UK performance of\nPe\u00afteris Vasks\u2019s Piano Quartet, composed in 2000. \nThe Vasks, almost 40 minutes in length, is a\nmajor addition to the piano-quartet repertoire.\nWritten in an unashamedly melodic style directly\ndescended from Shostakovich, it uses the drama-\nturgy familiar from other Vasks works: an\nalternation between the bleakness of this world\nand another one, an ecstatic, enchanted place\nwhere the spirit takes refuge. The Quartet begins\nwith a Preludio that sets up the piano and strings\nin a Q&A session of gentle heterophony which\nturns out to be headed towards a suite of folk\ndances that swing between nostalgia and lusty\nenthusiasm. The \u2018Canti drammatici\u2019 which consti-\ntute the third movement take the form of a\nfurther dialogue between piano and strings, an\nimpassioned imploratio. A cello cadenza grows\nout of a note low on the piano, briefly bringing a\ntrompe l\u2019oreille effect of amplification; the viola\ntakes over the cadenza and the violins add echoes\nof Jewish melisma. The fourth movement, \u2018Quasi\nuna passacaglia\u2019, opens with angry piano writing,\nleading to rocking harmonics in the strings over\nfolk-like melodic material in the piano, the music\ngrowing in volume and confidence until it launch-\nes into another fierce folk-dance using repetitive\nrhythmic fragments \u00e0 la Shostakovich, and with\nsomething of his rhetorical manner, too. The\necstasy subsides and a long-held piano chord\nintroduces a \u2018Canto principale\u2019 and we are back in\nthis mournful world again, with another extended\ncello solo, its sad lyricism taken up by viola and\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f76\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nviolin.
