China\n(Dated: February 18, 2008)\nWe introduce a parametrization scheme for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P where the effects of SU(3) flavor sym-\nmetry breaking and doubly OZI-rule violation (DOZI) can be parametrized by certain parameters\nwith explicit physical interpretations. This scheme can be used to clarify the glueball-qq\u00af mixing\nwithin the pseudoscalar mesons. We also include the contributions from the electromagnetic (EM)\ndecays of J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 via J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P . Via study of the isospin violated channels, such\nas J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9pi0 and \u03c6pi0, reasonable constraints on the EM decay contributions are\nobtained. With the up-to-date experimental data for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P , J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03b3P and P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3,\netc, we arrive at a consistent description of the mentioned processes with a minimal set of parame-\nters. As a consequence, we find that there exists an overall suppression of the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g form factors,\nwhich sheds some light on the long-standing \u201c\u03c1pi puzzle\u201d. By determining the glueball components\ninside the pseudoscalar \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 in three different glueball-qq\u00af mixing schemes, we deduce that the\nlowest pseudoscalar glueball, if exists, has rather small qq\u00af component, and it makes the \u03b7(1405) a\npreferable candidate for 0\u2212+ glueball.\nPACS numbers: 13.20.Gd, 12.40.Vv, 13.25.-k, 12.39.Mk\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCharmonium decays into light hadrons provides unique places to probe light hadron structures. In\nparticular, in the hadronic decays of charmonia such as J\/\u03c8, \u03b7c and \u03c7cJ etc, the annihilation of the heavy\ncc\u00af pair into intermediate gluons, which must be then hadronized into hadrons, could favor the production\nof unconventional hadrons such as glueball and hybrids in the final-state. Such states, different from the\nconventional qq\u00af or qqq structures in the non-relativistic constituent quark model, can serve as a direct\ntest of QCD as a non-Abelian gauge theory.\nIn the past decades, the exclusive hadronic decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P have attracted a lot of attention\nin both experiment and theory. These processes, in which the helicity is non-conserved, must be sup-\npressed according to the selection rule of pQCD hadronic helicity conservation due to the vector nature\nof gluons [1]. According to the \u201cpQCD power\u201d suppression of helicity conservation and breaking, one\nshould have BR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0)\/BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0) \u2243 (MJ\/\u03c8\/M\u03c8\u2032)6 \u223c 0.35 [1]. However, the experimental data\nshow that this ratio is badly violated in reality, BR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0)\/BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0) \u2243 (0.2 \u00b1 0.1)% [2], i.e.\nmuch greatly suppressed. It led to the so-called \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d in the study of J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 exclusive decays,\nand initiated a lot of interests to the relevant issues [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nAn alternative expression of the \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d is via the ratios between J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 annihilating into three\ngluons and a single photon:\nR \u2261 BR(\u03c8\n\u2032 \u2192 hadrons)\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 hadrons)\n\u2243 BR(\u03c8\n\u2032 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 e+e\u2212) \u2243 12%, (1)\n2which is empirically called \u201c12% rule\u201d. Since most of those exclusive decays for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 seem to\nabide by this empirical rule reasonably well, it is puzzling that the ratios for \u03c1\u03c0 and K\u2217K\u00af + c.c. deviate\ndramatically from it. A recent article by Mo, Yuan and Wang provides a detailed review of the present\navailable explanations (see Ref. [18] and references therein).\nA catch-up of this subject is an analysis by authors here for the electromagnetic decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192\n\u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P [19]. There, it is shown that although the EM contributions to J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P are generally small\nrelative to the strong decays as found by many other studies [20], they may turn to be more competitive\nin \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P compared with \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g \u2192 V P amplitudes, and produce crucial interferences [19]. For a\nbetter understanding of the \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d, a thorough study of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P including both strong and\nEM transitions and accommodating the up-to-date experimental information [21, 22, 23, 24] should be\nnecessary.\nThe reaction channels J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P also give access to another interesting issue in non-perturbative\nQCD. They may be used to probe the structure of the isoscalar 0\u2212+, i.e. \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 in their recoiling isoscalar\nvector mesons \u03c9 or \u03c6. Since vector meson \u03c9 and \u03c6 are almost ideally mixed, i.e. \u03c9 = (uu\u00af+ dd\u00af)\/\n\u221a\n2 and\n\u03c6 = ss\u00af, the decay of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c9\u03b7, \u03c9\u03b7\u2032, \u03c6\u03b7, and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 will provide information about \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032, which can\nbe produced via the so-called singly OZI disconnected (SOZI) processes for the same flavor components,\nand doubly OZI disconnected (DOZI) processes for different flavor components.\nNonetheless, it can also put experimental constraints on the octet-singlet mixing as a consequence of\nthe U(1)A anomaly of QCD [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Recently, Leutwyler [32], and Feldmann\nand his collaborators [33] propose a \u03b7-\u03b7\u2032 mixing scheme in the quark flavor basis with an assumption that\nthe decay constants follow the pattern of particle state mixing, and thus are controlled by specific Fock\nstate wavefunctions at zero separation of the quarks, while the state mixing is referred to the mixing in\nthe overall wavefunctions. In the quark flavor basis it is shown that higher Fock states (specifically, |gg\u3009)\ndue to the anomaly give rise to a relation between the mixing angle and decay constants. This analysis\nbrings the question of gluon components inside \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 to much closer attention from both experiment\nand theory [33, 34], and initiates a lot of interests in the pseudoscalar sector, in particular, in line with\nthe search for pseudoscalar glueball candidates.\nThe lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations predict a mass for the lowest pseudoscalar glueball around 2.5\nGeV [35], which is higher than a number of 0\u2212+ resonances observed in the range of 1\u223c 2.3 GeV. However,\nsince the present LQCD calculations are based on quenched approximation, the glueball spectrum is still\nan open question in theory. In contrast, QCD phenomenological studies [36, 37, 38, 39] favor a much\nlower 0\u2212+ glueball mass, and make \u03b7(1405) a good glueball candidate due to its strong couplings to KK\u00af\u03c0\nand a0(980)\u03c0 and absence in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0 and \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 [2]. Study of J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P in flavor parametrization\nschemes was pursued in Ref. [20], where the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 were treated as eigenstates of qq\u00af. By assuming the\n\u03b7(1405) to be a glueball essentially and introducing a DOZI suppression factor for \u03c6G and \u03c9G amplitudes\nrelative to the SOZI processes, the authors seemed to have underestimated the branching ratios for\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1405)) and BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1405)). In Ref. [40] a mixing scheme for \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and \u03b7(1405)\nin a basis of (uu\u00af + dd\u00af)\/\n\u221a\n2, ss\u00af and G (glueball) was proposed and studied in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P . \u03b7(1405) was\nfound to be dominated by the glueball component, while the glueball component in \u03b7\u2032 was also sizeable.\nIn both studies, the EM contributions were included as a free parameter in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P . However, as we\nnow know that the EM contributions in \u03c8\u2032 are important [19]. Thus, a coherent study of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P\nincluding the EM contributions would be ideal for probing the structure of the pseudoscalar mesons.\nOn the theoretical side there is only one possible term in the effective Lagrangian for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P\nand it will reduce the number of the parameters needed in phenomenological studies. On the experimental\nside many new data with high accuracy are available. Hence, in this work, we shall revisit J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P\ntrying to clarify the following points: (i) What is the role played by the EM decay transitions? By isolating\nand constraining the EM transitions in a VMD model, we propose a parametrization scheme for the strong\ntransitions where the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking and DOZI violation effects can be accommodated.\nA reliable calculation of the EM transitions in turn will put a reasonable constraint on the strong decay\ntransitions in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P , and thus mechanisms leading to the \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d can be highlighted. (ii)\nWe shall probe the glueball components within \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 based on the available experimental data and\ndifferent quarkonia-glueball mixing schemes, and predict the 0\u2212+ glueball production rate in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\nhadronic decays.\nAs follows, we first present the parametrization scheme for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P and introduce the glueball\n3components into the pseudoscalars. We then briefly discuss the VMD model for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P .\nIn Section III, we present the model calculation results with detailed discussions. A summary will be\ngiven in Section IV.\nII. MODEL FOR J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P\nIn this Section, we first introduce a simple rule to parametrize out the strong decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P .\nWe then introduce a VMD model for the J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) EM decays into V P . A recent study of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192\n\u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P shows that the EM decay contributions become important in \u03c8\u2032 decays due to its large partial\ndecay width to e+e\u2212 though their importance is not so significant in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P [19]. In the isoscalar\npseudoscalar sector, we introduce three different glueball-qq\u00af mixing schemes for \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and a glueball\ncandidate \u03b7\u2032\u2032. Its production in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) hadronic decays can then be factorized out and estimated.\nA. Decay of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P via strong interaction\nThe strong decay of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P via 3g can be factorized out in a way similar to Ref. [41].\nFirst, we define the strength of the non-strange singly OZI disconnected (SOZI) process as\ngJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2261 \u3008(qq\u00af)V (qq\u00af)P |V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009, (2)\nwhere V0 denotes the 3g decay potential of the charmonia into two non-strange qq\u00af pairs of vector and\npseudoscalar via SOZI processes. But it should be noted that the subscription V and P do not mean\nthat the quark-antiquark pairs are flavor eigenstates of vector and pseudoscalar mesons. The amplitude\ngJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) is proportional to the charmonium wavefunctions at origin. Thus, it may have different values\nfor J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032.\nIn order to include the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects in the transition, we introduce\nR \u2261 \u3008(qs\u00af)V (sq\u00af)P |V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009\/gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) = \u3008(sq\u00af)V (qs\u00af)P |V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009\/gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), (3)\nwhich implies the occurrence of the SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking at each vertex where a pair of ss\u00af is\nproduced, and R = 1 is in the SU(3) flavour symmetry limit. For the production of two ss\u00af pairs via the\nSOZI potential, the recognition of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking in the transition is accordingly\nR2 \u2243 \u3008(ss\u00af)V (ss\u00af)P |V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009\/gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) . (4)\nSimilar to Ref. [41], the DOZI process is distinguished from the SOZI ones by the gluon counting rule.\nA parameter r is introduced to describe the relative strength between the DOZI and SOZI transition\namplitudes:\nr \u2261 \u3008(ss\u00af)V (qq\u00af)P |V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009\/gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) = \u3008(qq\u00af)V (ss\u00af)P |V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009\/gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), (5)\nwhere V1 denotes the charmonium decay potential via the DOZI processes; In the circumstance that the\nOZI rule is respected, one expects |r| \u223c 0.\nThrough the above definitions, we express the amplitudes for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V (qq\u00af)P as\nMK\u2217+K\u2212 = \u3008K\u2217+K\u2212|V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)R , (6)\nM\u03c1+pi\u2212 = \u3008\u03c1+\u03c0\u2212|V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) , (7)\nM\u03c10pi0 = \u3008\u03c10\u03c00|V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) , (8)\nM\u03c6(ss\u00af) = \u3008\u03c6(ss\u00af)P |V0 + V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = R2gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)(1 + r), (9)\nM\u03c6(nn\u00af) = \u3008\u03c6(nn\u00af)P |V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 =\n\u221a\n2r\u3008\u03c6(ss\u00af)P |V0|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 =\n\u221a\n2rRgJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), (10)\nM\u03c9(ss\u00af) = \u3008\u03c9(ss\u00af)P |V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 =\n\u221a\n2RrgJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), (11)\nM\u03c9(nn\u00af) = \u3008\u03c9(nn\u00af)P |V0 + V1|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)(1 + 2r), (12)\n4where the channels KK\u00af\u2217 and \u03c1\u2212\u03c0+ have the same expressions as their conjugate channels; nn\u00af \u2261 (uu\u00af+\ndd\u00af)\/\n\u221a\n2 is the non-strange isospin singlet. We have assumed that \u03c6 and \u03c9 are ideally mixed and they are\npure ss\u00af and nn\u00af, respectively.\nThe recoiled pseudoscalars by \u03c6 and \u03c9 can be either \u03b7 or \u03b7\u2032 for which we consider that a small glueball\ncomponent will mix with the dominant qq\u00af in the quark flavour basis. The detailed discussion about the\nqq\u00af and glueball mixings in \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 will be given in the next section. Here, we relate the production of\nglueball G in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c9G and \u03c6G with the basic amplitude gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) by assuming the validity of gluon\ncounting rule in the transitions [41, 42], i.e.\n\u3008(qq\u00af)VG|V3|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 \u2261 gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) , (13)\nwhere V3 denotes the glueball G production potential recoiling a flavour singlet qq\u00af. This can be regarded\nas reasonable since generally the glueball does not pay a price for its couplings to gluons. Consequently,\nwe have\nM\u03c6G = \u3008\u03c6G|V3|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)R\nM\u03c9G = \u3008\u03c9G|V3|J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u3009 =\n\u221a\n2gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) , (14)\nwith the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking considered for the \u03c6 production.\nThe above parametrization highlights several interesting features in those decay channels. It shows\nthat the decay of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 is free of interferences from the DOZI processes and possible SU(3)\nflavor symmetry breaking. Ideally, such a process will be useful for us to determine gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032). The decay\nof J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 K\u2217K\u00af+c.c. is also free of DOZI interferences, but correlates with the SU(3) breaking. These\ntwo sets of decay channels will, in principle, allow us to determine the basic decay amplitude gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\nand the SU(3) flavor breaking effects, which can then be tested in other channels. For \u03c6\u03b7, \u03c6\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03b7 and\n\u03c9\u03b7\u2032, the transition amplitudes will also depend on the \u03b7-\u03b7\u2032 mixing angles and we will present detailed\ndiscussions in later part.\nIn the calculation of the partial decay width, we must apply the commonly used form factor\nF2(P) \u2261 |P|2l exp(\u2212P2\/8\u03b22), (15)\nwhere P and the l are the three momentum and the relative orbit angular momentum of the final-\nstate mesons, respectively, in the J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) rest frame. We adopt \u03b2 = 0.5GeV, which is the same as\nRefs. [42, 43, 44]. At leading order the decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P are via P -wave, i.e. l = 1. This form\nfactor accounts for the size effects from the spatial wavefunctions of the initial and final-state mesons.\nB. Decay of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P via EM interaction\nDetailed study of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P in a VMD model is presented in Ref. [19]. In this process,\nthree independent transitions contribute to the total amplitude as shown by Fig. 2. The advantage of\ntreating this process in the VMD model is to benefit from the available experimental information for all\nthose coupling vertices. As a result the only parameter present in the EM transition amplitude is the\nform factor for the virtual photon couplings to the initial (J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032) and final state vector mesons (\u03c9,\n\u03c6, \u03c1 and K\u2217). As shown in Ref. [19], the isospin violated channels, \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03c0 and \u03c6\u03c0, provides a good\nconstraint on the \u03b3\u2217V P form factors without interferences from the strong decays. Therefore, a reliable\nestimate of the EM transitions can be reached.\nFollowing the analysis of Ref. [19], the invariant transition amplitude for J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P at tree level\ncan be expressed as:\nMEM \u2261 MA +MB +MC\n=\n(\ne\nfV 2\ngV 1\u03b3P\nMV 1\nFa + e\nfV 1\ngV 2\u03b3P\nMV 2\nFb + e\n2\nfV 1fV 2\ngP\u03b3\u03b3\nMP\nFc\n)\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\n\u00b5V \u03bd1 \u2202\n\u03b1V \u03b22 P, (16)\n5where e\/fV denotes the \u03b3\n\u2217V couplings, and gV \u03b3P is the coupling determined in the radiative decay of\nV \u2192 \u03b3V ; Fa, Fb and Fc denote the form factors corresponding to the transitions of Fig. 2. For Fig. 2(a)\nand (b) a typical monopole (MP) form factor is adopted:\nF(q2) = 1\n1\u2212 q2\/\u039b2 (17)\nwith \u039b = 0.542 \u00b1 0.008 GeV and \u039b = 0.577 \u00b1 0.011 GeV determined with a constructive (MP-C) or\ndestructive phase (MP-D) between (a) and (b), respectively. We think that the non-perturbative QCD\neffects might have played a role in the transitions at J\/\u03c8 energy. For instance, in Fig. 2(a) and (b) a\npair of quarks may be created from vacuum as described by 3P0 model, the pQCD hadronic helicity-\nconservation due to the vector nature of gluon is violated quite strongly. A monopole-like (MP) form\nfactor should be appropriate for coping with the suppression effects, and it is consistent with the VMD\nframework. In principle such a form factor can be tested experimentally via measuring the couplings of\nthe processes J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 Pe+e\u2212 and e+e\u2212 \u2192 Pe+e\u2212, respectively, when the integrated luminosity at\nJ\/\u03c8 and the suitable energies for e+e\u2212 colliders is accumulated enough.\nDue to an error of missing a factor of\n\u221a\n2 in Tab. I of Ref. [19], we give here in Table I the coupling\ne\/fV again. Also, we clarify that although the overall factor of\n\u221a\n2 will change the fitted cut-off energy\n\u039b and the fitted branching ratios slightly in Ref. [19], the pattern obtained there retains and the major\nconclusion is intact.\nThe form factor for (c) has a form of:\nFc(q21 , q22) =\n1\n(1 \u2212 q21\/\u039b2)(1 \u2212 q22\/\u039b2)\n, (18)\nwhere q21 = M\n2\nV 1 and q\n2\n2 = M\n2\nV 2 are the squared four-momenta carried by the time-like photons. We\nassume that the \u039b is the same as in Eq. (17), thus, Fc = FaFb.\nA parameter \u03b4 is introduced to take into account the relative phase between the EM and strong\ntransitions:\nM =M3g + ei\u03b4MEM . (19)\nIt will then be determined by the experimental data in the numerical fitting. In the limit of \u03b4 = 0, the\nrelative phase reduces to the same ones given in Ref. [20].\nC. Mixing of the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u2032 and implication of a 0\u2212+ glueball\nThe \u03b7\u2212\u03b7\u2032 mixing is a long-standing question in the literature. Here we would like to study the \u201cmixing\u201d\nproblem by including empirically a possible glueball component in the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 wavefunctions. We extend\nthe mixing of the the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 as a consequence of the flavor singlet nn\u00af, ss\u00af and glueball mixing. The\ncorresponding glueball candidate is denoted as \u03b7\u2032\u2032. In the quark flavor basis, treating \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and \u03b7\u2032\u2032 as the\neigenstates of the mass matrix M with the eigenvalues of their masses M\u03b7, M\u03b7\u2032 and M\u03b7\u2032\u2032 , we have\nUMU\u22121 =\n(\nM\u03b7 0 0\n0 M\u03b7\u2032 0\n0 0 M\u03b7\u2032\u2032\n)\n, (20)\nwhere U is the state mixing matrix:(\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\u2032\n\u03b7\u2032\u2032\n)\n= U\n(\nnn\u00af\nss\u00af\nG\n)\n=\n(\nx1 y1 z1\nx2 y2 z2\nx3 y3 z3\n)(\nnn\u00af\nss\u00af\nG\n)\n. (21)\nThree mixing schemes are applied to determine the mixing matrix elememts.\nI) CKM approach\n6By assuming that the nn\u00af, ss\u00af and glueball G make a complete set of eigenstates, and physical states\nare their linear combinations, we can express the mixing in the same way as the CKM matrix with the\nphase \u03b4 = 0 (no CP violation is involved):\nU =\n(\nc12c13 s12c13 s13\n\u2212s13c23 \u2212 c12s23s13 c12c23 \u2212 s12s23s13 s23c13\ns12s23 \u2212 c12c23s13 \u2212c12s23 \u2212 s12c23s13 c23c13\n)\n, (22)\nwhere cij \u2261 cos \u03b8ij and sij \u2261 sin \u03b8ij with \u03b8ij the mixing angles to be determined by the experimental data.\nThe feature of this approach is that the completeness guarantees the unitary and orthogonal relations\nof the matrix. However, it also implies that mixings beyond qq\u00af and glueball are not allowed. This may\nbe a strong assumption since resonances and exotic states such as tetraquarks with the same quantum\nnumber could also mix with the qq\u00af and glueball. Because of this, the CKM approach will test the extreme\ncondition that only ground state qq\u00af and G mix with each other.\nII) qq\u00af-G mixing due to higher Fock state |gg\u3009\nThis scenario is initiated by the QCD U(1)A anomaly. In a series of studies by Feldmann et al. [33, 34],\nit is pointed out that an appropriate treatment of the mixing requires to distinguish matrix elements\nof \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 with local currents and overall state mixings. Nonetheless, the divergences of axial-vector\ncurrents including the axial anomaly connect the short-distance properties, i.e. decay constants, with\nthe long-distance phenomena such as the mass-mixing, and highlight the twist-4 |gg\u3009 component in the\nFock state decomposition. In the quark flavor basis, higher Fock state due to anomaly can give rise to a\nnon-vanishing qq\u00af \u2192 |gg\u3009 transition. Similar to the prescription of Ref. [33, 34], we introduce the glueball\ncomponents in \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 via the higher Fock state decompositions in \u03b7n and \u03b7s:\n|\u03b7n\u3009 = \u03a8q|nn\u00af\u3009+\u03a8gq |gg\u3009+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n|\u03b7s\u3009 = \u03a8s|ss\u00af\u3009+\u03a8gs |gg\u3009+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (23)\nwhere \u03a8q and \u03a8s are amplitudes of the corresponding qq\u00af while \u03a8\ng\nq and \u03a8\ng\ns are those of the |gg\u3009 components;\nThe dots denote higher Fock states with additional gluon and\/or qq\u00af which is beyond the applicability of\nthis approach. The presence of the gluonic Fock states in association with isoscalar nn\u00af and ss\u00af breaks the\northogonality between nn\u00af and ss\u00af, and we parametrize such an effect in \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 wavefunctions:\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 1\u221a\nN1\n[a(cos\u03c6|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 sin\u03c6|ss\u00af\u3009) + b(cos\u03c6\u2212 sin\u03c6)|gg\u3009],\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 1\u221a\nN2\n[a(sin\u03c6|nn\u00af\u3009+ cos\u03c6|ss\u00af\u3009) + b(sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6)|gg\u3009], (24)\nwhere the normalization factors are N1 = a\n2+b2(1\u2212sin 2\u03c6) and N2 = a2+b2(1+sin 2\u03c6), and parameters\na and b are to be determined by experiment. In this treatment, a and b now correlate with the mixing\nangle \u03c6 \u2261 \u03b8 + arctan\u221a2, with \u03b8 as the octet-singlet mixing angle defined in the SU(3) symmetry limit\n(b \u2192 0). For the commonly accepted range \u03b8 \u2243 \u221224.6\u25e6 or \u221211.5\u25e6 from the linear or quadratic mass\nformulae, respectively [2], the glueball component in \u03b7 has a strength of b(cos\u03c6 \u2212 sin\u03c6)\/\u221aN1, which is\nrelatively suppressed in comparison with that in \u03b7\u2032, i.e. b(sin\u03c6 + cos\u03c6)\/\n\u221a\nN2, for 0\n\u25e6 < \u03c6 < 90\u25e6. This\nnaturally gives rise to the scenario addressed in Ref. [33, 34].\nBased on the unitary and orthogonal relation for three mixed states, we can derive:\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nx23 = 1\u2212 (x21 + x22),\ny23 = 1\u2212 (y21 + y22),\nz23 = 1\u2212 (z21 + z22).\n(25)\nwhich will provide information about the qq\u00af and glueball components in \u03b7\u2032 though it is not necessary for\nthe unitary and orthogonal relation being satisfied. If other higher Fock states which are negligible in \u03b7\nand \u03b7\u2032 are present in \u03b7\u2032\u2032 with sizable amplitude, further constraints on the mixing wavefunction for \u03b7\u2032\u2032\nwill be needed.\nIII) Mixing in an old perturbation theory\n7Considering the mixing between quarkonia and glueball at leading order of a perturbation potential,\ni.e. the transition strength between two states are much smaller than the mass difference of these two\nstates, we can then express the physical states as [43]\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 1\nC1\n[\n|nn\u00af\u3009+\n\u221a\n2fb\nMnn\u00af \u2212Mss\u00af |ss\u00af\u3009+\n\u221a\n2fa\nMnn\u00af \u2212MG |G\u3009\n]\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 1\nC2\n[ \u221a\n2fb\nMss\u00af \u2212Mnn\u00af |nn\u00af\u3009+ |ss\u00af\u3009+\n\u221a\n2fa\nMss\u00af \u2212MG |G\u3009\n]\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 1\nC3\n[ \u221a\n2fa\nMG \u2212Mnn\u00af |nn\u00af\u3009+\n\u221a\n2fa\nMG \u2212Mss\u00af |ss\u00af\u3009+ |G\u3009\n]\n, (26)\nwhere fa \u2261 \u3008ss\u00af|Vg|G\u3009 = \u3008nn\u00af|Vg|G\u3009\/\n\u221a\n2 is the mixing strength for glueball-qq\u00af transitions, while\nfb \u2261 \u3008qq\u00af|Vq|ss\u00af\u3009 is the ss\u00af and non-strange qq\u00af mixing strength via transition potential Vq. C1,2,3 are\nthe normalization factors. Mnn\u00af, Mss\u00af and MG are masses for the pure 0\n\u2212+ quarkonia and glueball states,\nrespectively. They will be determined with parameters fa and fb by fitting the experimental data to\nsatisfy the the physical masses for \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and \u03b7\u2032\u2032, and unitary and orthogonal relations.\nThe above three parametrization schemes address different aspects correlated with the glueball-qq\u00af\nmixing. The CKM approach automatically satisfies the unitary and orthogonal relations, and allows the\nmixing exclusively among those three states. In reality, this may not be the case, and other configurations\nwith the same quantum number may also be present in the wavefunctions. The second scheme introducing\nquarkonia-glueball mixing within \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 via higher Fock state. In principle, there is no constraint on the\n\u03b7\u2032\u2032 configuration. Thus, unitary and orthogonal relations do not necessarily apply to those three states.\nThe third scheme applies the old perturbation theory and considers the non-vanishing transitions between\nthose pure states. As a result, a physical state will be a mixture of quarkonia-glueball configurations. The\nunitary and orthogonal relations will be a constraint in the determination of the parameters. Comparing\nthese three different parametrization schemes, we expect that the quarkonia-glueball mixing mechanism\nand implication of the pseudoscalar glueball candidate can be highlighted.\nIn Table II, the transition amplitudes for the strong decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P are given.\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nWith the above preparations, we do the numerical calculations and present the results in this section.\nA. Parameters and fitting scheme\nThe parameters introduced in these three different approaches can be classified into two classes. One\nconsists of parameters which are commonly defined in all three schemes, such as gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), r and R,\nand \u03b4. Parameter gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) is the basic transition strength for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\n\u2032) \u2192 V P , and proportional to the\nwavefunctions at origin for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032). Obviously, it has different values for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 decays, respectively.\nParameter R and r are the relative strengths of the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking and DOZI violation\nprocesses to gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032). They can also have different values in J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\n\u2032 decays. Parameter \u03b4 indicates\nthe relative phases between the strong and EM transition amplitudes.\nThe other class consists of parameters for quarkonia-glueball mixings, for instance, the mixing angles\nin the CKM approach, and masses Mnn\u00af, Mss\u00af, and MG for the 0\n\u2212+ quarkonia and glueball, respectively.\nThese parameters depend on the mixing schemes, and as mentioned earlier they give rise to different\nscenarios concerning the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 mixings. We shall discuss their properties in association with the\nnumerical results in the next section.\nIt should be noted that in the VMD model for the EM decay transitions [19] all couplings are deter-\nmined independently by accommodating the experimental information for V1(V2)\u2192 e+e\u2212, P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and\nV1(V2) \u2192 \u03b3P or P \u2192 \u03b3V2, where V1 = J\/\u03c8 or \u03c8\u2032, V2 = \u03c9, \u03c6, \u03c1, or K\u2217, and P = \u03c0, \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 or K. This\n8is essential for accounting for the EM contributions properly. Meanwhile, the radiative decays, such as\nV \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 and \u03b3\u03b7\u2032, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, can probe the qq\u00af structure of the vector and pseudoscalar mesons.\nTheir constraints on the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 mixing have been embedded in constraining the EM transitions. As\nshown in Ref. [19], all the experimental data for V1(V2)\u2192 e+e\u2212, P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and V1(V2)\u2192 \u03b3P or P \u2192 \u03b3V2\nhave been included.\nGiven a reliable description of the EM transitions, we can then proceed to determine the strong transi-\ntion parameters and configuration mixings within the pseudoscalars by fitting the data for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P .\nThe numerical study step is taken as follows: i) Fit the data for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P with only the strong\ndecay transitions; ii) Fit the data for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P including the EM decay contributions. Comparing\nthose two situations, information about the role played by the EM transitions, and their correlations\nwith the strong decay amplitudes can thus be extracted. The \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 configurations can also be con-\nstrained. We emphasize that a reasonable estimate of the EM contributions is a prerequisite for a better\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P .\nB. Numerical results and analysis\nFor each of these three parametrization schemes, three cases are examined: i) with exclusive contri-\nbutions from J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) strong decays; ii) with a MP-D form factor for the EM transitions; and iii) with\na MP-C form factor for the EM transitions. The parameters are listed in Table III-V, and the fitting\nresults are listed in Tables VII and VIII for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032, respectively.\nIn general, without the EM contributions the fitting results have a relatively larger \u03c72 value. With the\nEM contributions, the results are much improved for both MP-D and MP-C model. To be more specific,\nwe first make an analysis of the commonly defined parameters, i.e. gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032), r, R and \u03b4, and then discuss\nthe quarkonia-glueball mixing parameters for each scheme.\nFor those commonly defined parameters their fitted values turn to be consistent with each other in those\nthree schemes. It is interesting to compare the fitted values for the basic transition amplitude gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\nfor J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032. It shows that the inclusion of the EM contributions will bring significant changes to this\nquantity in \u03c8\u2032 decays, while it keeps rather stable in J\/\u03c8 decays. This agrees with the observation that\nthe EM contributions in J\/\u03c8 hadronic decays are less significant relative to the strong ones [20, 40]. The\nabsolute value of gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) for \u03c8\n\u2032 is naturally smaller than that for J\/\u03c8. Since gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) is proportional to\nthe wavefunctions at origins [19], the small fraction, [g\u03c8\u2032\/gJ\/\u03c8]\n2 \u2243 0.018, implies an overall suppression\nof the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g form factors in \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P , which is smaller than the pQCD expectation, \u223c 12%. It is\nworth noting that this suppression occurs not only to \u03c1\u03c0, but also to all the other V P channels. We shall\ncome back to this point in the later part.\nParameter r, denoting the OZI-rule violation effects, turns to be sizeable in J\/\u03c8 decays but smaller in\n\u03c8\u2032 decays though relatively large uncertainties are accompanying. This is consistent with our expectation\nthat the DOZI processes in \u03c8\u2032 decays will be relatively suppressed in comparison with those in J\/\u03c8\ndecays. However, it is noticed that r has quite large uncertainties in \u03c8\u2032 decays though the central values\nare small. This reflects that data for \u03c8\u2032 decays still possess relatively large errors, and increased statistics\nmay better constrain this parameter.\nThe SU(3) breaking parameter exhibits an overall consistency in the fittings. Relatively large SU(3)\nflavor symmetry breaking turns to occur in the J\/\u03c8 decays compared with that in \u03c8\u2032. In the case without\nEM contributions, the SU(3) breaking in \u03c8\u2032 decays also turns to be large. This may reflect the necessity\nof including the EM contributions. It shows that the SU(3) symmetry breaking in J\/\u03c8 can be as large\nas about 34%, while it is about 5-20% in \u03c8\u2032 decays.\nThe phase angle \u03b4 is fitted for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032, respectively, when the EM contributions are included. It\nshows that J\/\u03c8 favors a complex amplitude introduced by the EM transitions. In contrast, the strong\nand EM amplitudes in \u03c8\u2032 decays is approximately out of phase. This means that the strong and EM\ntransitions will have destructive cancellations in \u03c1\u03c0, K\u2217+K\u2212+c.c., but constructively interfere with each\nother in K\u22170K\u00af0 + c.c. As qualitatively discussed in Ref. [19], this phase can lead to further suppression\nto \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, and also explain the difference between K\u2217+K\u2212+ c.c. and K\u22170K\u00af0+ c.c. The relative phases\nare in agreement with the results of Ref. [14], but different from those in Ref. [16].\n91. CKM approach\nIn this mixing scheme it shows that mixing angles \u03b812 and \u03b823 are well constrained by the experimental\ndata while large uncertainties occur to \u03b813 when the EM transitions are included. The corresponding\nmatrix element sin \u03b812 favors a small value which implies small glueball component inside \u03b7 meson. The\nmixed wavefunctions obtained with different EM interferences are:\nwithout EM :\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.915|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.404|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.003|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = \u22120.398|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.903|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.163|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.068|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.148|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.987|G\u3009\n; (27)\nMP-D Model:\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.904|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.427|ss\u00af\u3009+ 1.44\u00d7 10\u22125|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = \u22120.421|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.892|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.166|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.071|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.150|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.986|G\u3009\n; (28)\nand\nMP-C Model:\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.901|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.433|ss\u00af\u3009+ 5.0\u00d7 10\u22127|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = \u22120.427|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.888|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.168|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.073|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.151|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.986|G\u3009\n. (29)\nIt shows that though \u03b813 has large uncertainties, its central values indicate a small glueball component\nin \u03b7. In particular, we find sin \u03b813 \u2243 0 in the MP-D model, while sin \u03b813 = 0.003 or 5.0\u00d7 10\u22127 from the\ncalculations without EM contributions or in the MP-C model, respectively. In contrast, the amplitude of\nthe glueball component in the \u03b7\u2032 wavefunction is much larger. In all three models (and also in all three\nmixing schemes), a stable glueball mixing magnitude of \u223c 17% is favored.\nThe automatically satisfied unitary and orthogonal conditions lead to the prediction of the structure\nof the \u03b7\u2032\u2032. Assuming \u03b7(1405) corresponding to \u03b7\u2032\u2032, the CKM scheme leads to a prediction of glueball-\ndominance inside \u03b7(1405). About 15% of ss\u00af and 7% of nn\u00af are also required in \u03b7\u2032\u2032 and they favor to be\nout of phase to the G component.\n2. Quarkonia-glueball mixing due to higher Fock state\nTable IV shows that the octet-singlet mixing angle \u03b8 for \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 is within the reasonable range\nof \u221224.6\u25e6 \u223c \u221211.5\u25e6 as found by other studies [2]. Both \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 can accommodate a small glueball\ncomponent in association with the dominant qq\u00af. Parameter a and b are fitted by quite different values\nwith or without EM contributions. But remember that it is the quantities a\/\n\u221a\nN1, b\/\n\u221a\nN1, a\/\n\u221a\nN2 and\nb\/\n\u221a\nN2 that alter the simple quark flavor mixing angles, we should compare the mixed wavefunctions for\n\u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 in those fittings:\nwithout EM :\n{ |\u03b7\u3009 = 0.866|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.494|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.070|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.480|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.841|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.250|G\u3009 ; (30)\nMP-D Model:\n{ |\u03b7\u3009 = 0.859|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.510|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.046|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.503|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.847|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.173|G\u3009 ; (31)\nand\nMP-C Model:\n{ |\u03b7\u3009 = 0.859|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.510|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.042|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.504|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.848|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.163|G\u3009 . (32)\nGenerally, it shows that the glueball component in \u03b7 is small and in \u03b7\u2032 is relatively large. The qq\u00af\ncontents are the dominant ones in their wavefunctions. In the case without EM contributions, the signs\n10\nfor the glueball component are opposite to those with the EM contributions included. Since the glueball\ncomponents are small, the qq\u00af mixing patterns are quite similar in these three fittings, in particular, MP-D\nand MP-C give almost the same results. We note in advance that the best fitting results are obtained in\nthe MP-C model. Thus, we concentrate on the MP-C model here and try to extract information about\nthe glueball candidate \u03b7\u2032\u2032. Similar discussions can be applied to the other two schemes.\nThe above three equations indicate that orthogonality between |\u03b7\u3009 and \u03b7\u2032\u3009 is approximately satisfied:\n\u3008\u03b7|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = \u22120.6%. This would allow us to derive the mixing matrix elements for \u03b7\u2032\u2032 based on the unitary\nand orthogonal relation:(\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\u2032\n\u03b7\u2032\u2032\n)\n=\n(\nx1 y1 z1\nx2 y2 z2\nx3 y3 z3\n)(\nnn\u00af\nss\u00af\nG\n)\n=\n(\n0.859 \u22120.510 0.042\n0.504 0.848 \u22120.163\n0.090 0.140 0.986\n)(\nnn\u00af\nss\u00af\nG\n)\n, (33)\nwhere the orthogonal relation is satisfied within 5% of uncertainties. Note that an overall sign for |\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 is\npossible.\nSo far, there is no much reliable information about the masses for |nn\u00af\u3009 and |ss\u00af\u3009. Also, there is no firm\nevidence for a 0\u2212+ state (denoted as \u03b7\u2032\u2032) as a glueball candidate and mixing with \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032. Interestingly,\nthe above mixing suggests a small qq\u00af-G coupling in the pseudoscalar sector, which is consistent with\nQCD sum rule studies [45]. As a test of this mixing pattern, we can substitute the physical masses for \u03b7,\n\u03b7\u2032 and 0\u2212+ resonances such as \u03b7(1405), \u03b7(1475) and \u03b7(1835) [46] into Eq. (33) to derive the pure glueball\nmass MG, and we obtain, MG \u2243M\u03b7\u2032\u2032 due to the dominant of the glueball component in \u03b7\u2032\u2032. Empirically,\nthis allows a 0\u2212+ glueball with much lighter masses than the prediction of LQCD [35].\nThe amplitude for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u2032\u2032 and \u03c9\u03b7\u2032\u2032 can be expressed as\nM\u03c6\u03b7\u2032\u2032 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)R[rx3 + (1 + r)y3 + z3]F(p) , (34)\nand\nM\u03c9\u03b7\u2032\u2032 = gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)[(1 + 2r)x3 +\n\u221a\n2Rry3 +\n\u221a\n2z3]F(p) . (35)\nFor those 0\u2212+ resonances assumed to be the \u03b7\u2032\u2032 in Eq. (33), predictions for their production rates in\nJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) decays are listed in Table VI. It shows that if those states are glueball candidates, their branching\nratios are likely at order of 10\u22123 in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u2032\u2032 and \u03c9\u03b7\u2032\u2032, and at 10\u22125 in \u03c8\u2032 decays. We do not present\nthe same calculations for the other two mixing schemes since they all produce similar results.\nExperimental signals for \u03b7(1405) in J\/\u03c8 radiative decays were seen at Mark III [47, 48] and DM2 [49].\nIn J\/\u03c8 hadronic decays DM2 reported BR < 2.5\u00d710\u22124 at CL = 90% with the unknown \u03b7(1405)\u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0\nbranching ratio included [50], and the search in Mark III [51] gave BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c6KK\u00af\u03c0) <\n1.2\u00d7 10\u22124 (90%C.L.) and BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1405)\u2192 \u03c9KK\u00af\u03c0) = (6.8 +1.9\u22121.6 \u00b1 1.7)\u00d7 10\n\u22124.\nThe estimate of its total width is still controversial and ranges from tens to more than a hundred MeV\nin different decay modes [2]. This at least suggests that BR(\u03b7(1405)\u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0) \u2243 10 \u223c 50%, and leads to\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1405)) \u2192 \u03c6KK\u00af\u03c0 \u223c< (1.49 \u223c 7.45)\u00d7 10\u22124. This range seems to be consistent with the\ndata [50, 51]. The prediction, BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1405)) = 7.32 \u00d7 10\u22123 turns to be larger than \u03c6 channel.\nA similar estimate gives, BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c9KK\u00af\u03c0) \u2243 (0.73 \u223c 3.66) \u00d7 10\u22123, and can also be\nregarded as in agreement with the data from Mark III [51]. A search for \u03b7(1405) at BES-III in J\/\u03c8 and\n\u03c8\u2032 hadronic decays will be helpful to clarify its property.\nThe same expectation can be applied to \u03b7(1475) and \u03b7(1835). If they are dominated by glueball\ncomponents, their production rate will be at order of 10\u22123 as shown in Table VI. \u03b7(1475), as the higher\nmass 0\u2212+ in the \u03b7(1440) bump, tends to favor decaying into KK\u00af\u03c0 (also via a0(980)\u03c0 and K\n\u2217K\u00af) [49].\nAs observed in experiment that the partial width for \u03b7(1475)\u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0 is about 87 MeV [2], an estimated\nbranching ratio of BR(\u03b7(1475) \u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0) = 0.1 \u223c 0.5 will lead to BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1475) \u2192 \u03c6KK\u00af\u03c0) =\n(1.33 \u223c 6.65) \u00d7 10\u22124 and BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7(1475) \u2192 \u03c9KK\u00af\u03c0) = (6.81 \u223c 34.05) \u00d7 10\u22124. This value is\ncompatible with the production of \u03b7(1405), thus, should have been seen at Mark III in both \u03c9 and \u03c6\nchannel. However, signals for \u03b7(1475) is only seen in \u03c6 channel at BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(1475) \u2192 \u03c6KK\u00af\u03c0) <\n2.1\u00d710\u22124 (90%C.L.) [51]. Such an observation is more consistent with the \u03b7(1475) being an ss\u00af-dominant\nstate as the radial excited state of \u03b7\u2032 [36, 52]. Its vanishing branching ratio in \u03c9 channel can be naturally\n11\nexplained by the DOZI suppressions. We also note that \u03b7(1475)\u2019s presence in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 KK\u00af\u03c0 [53] certainly\nenhances its assignment as a radial excited ss\u00af state in analogy with \u03b7(1295) as the radial excited nn\u00af [36,\n52].\nThe narrow resonance X(1835) reported by BES in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X(1835) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b7\u2032 is likely to have\nJPC = 0\u2212+ [46], and could be the same state reported earlier in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp\u00af [54]. Its branching ratio is\nreported to be BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X(1835)\u2192 \u03b3\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b7\u2032) = (2.2\u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.4)\u00d7 10\u22124. By assuming that it is a\npseudoscalar glueball candidate, its production branching ratios in \u03c6\u03b7(1835) and \u03c9\u03b7(1835) are predicted\nin Table VI. If \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b7\u2032 is the dominant decay channel, one would expect to have a good chance to see it\nin \u03c9\u03b7(1835) channel. Since it is unlikely that a glueball state decays exclusively to \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b7\u2032 (and possibly\npp\u00af), the predicted branching ratio BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9X(1835)) = 3.66 \u00d7 10\u22123 has almost ruled out its being\na glueball candidate though a search for the X(1835) in its recoiling \u03c9 should still be interesting. A\nnumber of explanations for the nature of the X(1835) were proposed in the literature. But we are not to\ngo to any details here.\nWith the above experimental observation, our results turn to favor the \u03b7(1405) being a pseudoscalar\nglueball candidate.\n3. Mixing in an old perturbation theory\nIn this scheme, the masses of the nn\u00af, ss\u00af and glueball G are treated as parameters along with the\n\u201cperturbative\u201d transition amplitudes fa and fb. What we refer to as \u201cperturbative\u201d here is that both\nfa and fb have values much smaller than the mass differences between those mixed states. The fitted\nresults in Table V indeed satisfy this requirement. Parameters fa is fitted to be around 76 MeV, which\nsuggests a rather small glueball component in \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 wavefunctions. In contrast, the nn\u00af and ss\u00af mixing\nstrength is slightly larger, i.e. fb \u2243 94 MeV. The fitted masses Mnn\u00af \u2243 0.658 GeV and Mss\u00af \u2243 0.853 GeV\nare located between the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032, which is consistent with the expectation of the quark-flavor mixing\npicture with a mixing angle \u03c6 = \u03b8+arctan\n\u221a\n2 \u223c 34.7\u25e6. The fitted mass for the glueball is about 1.4 GeV,\nwhich is determined by the assumption that the \u03b7(1405) is a pseudoscalar glueball candidate. Since the\ntransition amplitude fa is relatively small, the mixing does not bring significant differences between the\npure and physical glueball masses.\nThe wavefunctions for \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and \u03b7\u2032\u2032 in the three different considerations of the EM transitions are\nwithout EM :\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.864|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.479|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.157|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.480|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.864|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.152|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.176|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.170|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.970|G\u3009\n; (36)\nMP-D Model:\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.864|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.478|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.155|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.479|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.865|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.150|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.174|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.168|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.970|G\u3009\n; (37)\nand\nMP-C Model:\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n|\u03b7\u3009 = 0.868|nn\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.473|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.153|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u3009 = 0.473|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.869|ss\u00af\u3009 \u2212 0.147|G\u3009\n|\u03b7\u2032\u2032\u3009 = 0.171|nn\u00af\u3009+ 0.165|ss\u00af\u3009+ 0.971|G\u3009\n. (38)\nIn comparison with the first two mixing schemes, this approach in the framework of old perturbation\ntheory produces a similar mixing pattern as that in Scheme-II except that the glueball component in the\n\u03b7 wavefunction is quite significant, e.g. as shown in Eq. (38).\n4. The branching ratios for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P and violation of the \u201c12% rule\u201d\nThe fitted branching ratios for J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P are listed in Tables VII and VIII, and the results for the\nisospin violated channels are also included as a comparison. It shows that all these three parametrizations\ncan reproduce the data quite well though there are different features arising from the fitted results.\n12\nOne predominant feature is that in all the schemes, parameter gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) is found to have overall consistent\nvalues for both J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032. As pointed out earlier that the relatively small value of gJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) for \u03c8\n\u2032 suggests\nan overall suppression of the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g form factor. With the destructive interferences from the relatively\nlarge EM contributions, the branching ratios for \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 are further suppressed and this leads to the\nabnormally small branching ratio fractions between the exclusive decays of J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032. Numerically,\nthis explains why the 12% rule is violated in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0. Nonetheless, such a mechanism is rather\nindependent of the final state hadron, thus, should be more generally recognized in other exclusive\nchannels. This turns to be true. For instance, the large branching ratio difference between the charged\nand neutral K\u2217K\u00af + c.c. channels highlights the interferences from the EM transitions [19], where the\nrelative phases to the strong amplitudes are consistent with the expectations for the \u03c1\u03c0 channel [20].\nIn line with the overall good agreement of the fitting results to the data is an apparent deviation in\n\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u2032 in Scheme-II and III. The numerical fitting in Scheme-II gives BR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u2032) = 9.49 \u00d7 10\u22128\nin contrast with the data (3.2\n+2.5\n\u22122.1 )\u00d7 10\n\u22125 [2]. The significant deviation from the experimental central\nvalue is allowed by the associated large errors. In fact, this channel bears almost the largest uncertainties\nin the datum set. The small values from the numerical fitting also reflect the importance of the EM\ninterferences. Note that in the fitting with only strong transitions, the branching ratio for \u03c9\u03b7\u2032 has\nalready turned to be smaller than the data. With the EM contributions, which are likely to interfere\ndestructively, this channel is further suppressed.\nIn contrast, the CKM mixing scheme is able to reproduce the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u2032 branching ratio. This is because\nthe qq\u00af and G components are in phase in the \u03b7\u2032 wavefunctions in Eqs. (27)-(29). Since the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u2032\ndecay shows large sensitivities to the mixing scheme, it is extremely interesting to have more precise data\nfor this channel as a directly test of the mixing schemes proposed here. As BES-II may not be able to\ndo any better on this than been published [23], CLEO-c with a newly taken 25 million \u03c8\u2032 events can\npresumably clarify this [55].\nIn Table IX, we present the branching ratio fractions R for all the exclusive decay channels for the MP-C\nmodel. The extracted ratios from experimental data are also listed. Apart from those three channels, \u03c9\u03b7\u2032,\n\u03c1\u03b7\u2032 and \u03c6\u03c0, of which the data still have large uncertainties, the overall agreement is actually quite well. It\nclearly shows that the \u201c12% rule\u201d is badly violated in those exclusive decay channels, and the transition\namplitudes are no longer under control of pQCD leading twist [1]. The power suppression due to the\nviolation of the hadronic helicity conservation in pQCD will also be contaminated by other processes\nwhich are much non-perturbative, hence the pQCD-expected simple rule does not hold anymore. Note\nthat it is only for those isospin violated channels with exclusive EM transition as leading contributions,\nmay this simple rule be partly retained [13].\nIV. SUMMARY\nIn this work, we revisit J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P in a parametrization model for the charmonium strong decays\nand a VMD model for the EM decay contributions. By explicitly defining the SU(3) flavor symmetry\nbreaking and DOZI violation parameters, we obtain an overall good description of the present available\ndata. It shows that a reliable calculation of the EM contributions is important for understanding the\noverall suppression of the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g form factors. Our calculations suggest that \u03c1\u03c0 channel is not very much\nabnormal compared to other V P channels, and similar phenomena appear in K\u2217K\u00af as well. Meanwhile,\nwe strongly urge an improved experimental measurement of the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u2032 as an additional evidence for\nthe EM interferences. Although it is not for this analysis to answer why \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 3g is strongly suppressed,\nour results identify the roles played by the strong and EM transitions in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P , and provide\nsome insights into the long-standing \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d.\nSince the EM contributions are independently constrained by the available experimental data [2], the\nparameters determined for the pseudoscalar in the numerical study, in turn, can be examined by those\ndata. In particular, we find that \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 allow a small glue component, which can be referred to the\nhigher Fock state contributions due to the U(1)A anomaly. This gives rise to the correlated scenario\nbetween the octet-singlet mixing angle and the decay constants as addressed by Feldmann et al [33, 34].\nWe are also interested in the possibility of a higher glue-dominant state as a 0\u2212+ glueball candidate.\n13\nIndeed, based on the fact that only a comparatively small glueball component exists in \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032, we\nfind that a 0\u2212+ glueball which mixes with \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 is likely to have nearly pure glueball configuration.\nAlthough the obtained mixing matrix cannot pin down the mass for a glueball state, the glueball dom-\ninance suggests that such a glueball candidate will have large production rate in both \u03c6\u03b7\u2032\u2032 and \u03c9\u03b7\u2032\u2032 at\n10\u22123. This enhance the assignment that \u03b7(1405) is the 0\u2212+ glueball candidate if no signals for \u03b7(1475)\nand \u03b7(1835) appear simultaneously in their productions with \u03c6 and \u03c9 in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) decays. High-statistics\nsearch for their signals in \u03c6 and \u03c9 channel at BESIII will be able to clarify these results.\nAcknowledgement\nUseful discussions with F.E. Close, C.Z. Yuan and B.S.
