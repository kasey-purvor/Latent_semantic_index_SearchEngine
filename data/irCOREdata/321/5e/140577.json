The first manuscript \npresented a leachate modelling benchmark study and review of treatment technologies [1] in \nrelation to removing landfill pollutants and achieving environmental equilibrium status. \nEquilibrium is defined here as that state when emissions from a landfill site occur at a rate that \n 3\nallows sufficient natural attenuation in the surrounding environment to prevent environmental \nharm, so management is no longer required. To embody the principles of sustainability, \nequilibrium can only be achieved when the management period (post-closure when the site has \nceased accepting waste for disposal) is measured in decades rather than centuries. The \nhydrogeological scenario used as a basis for calculations is depicted in Figure 1. \n \nMODELLING METHODOLOGY \nModelling approach and objectives \n This section provides further information on the methodology; the details have been \nprovided in the review of treatment technologies provided in the first manuscript. The post \nprocessing capabilities of GoldSim [2] allowed multivariate analysis of the results, which is \nessential in order to correlate the length of aftercare period with long-term groundwater impacts. \nApart from the aftercare period, all other inputs to the model were set as single values only. \n \n Essentially the aftercare period was defined as a variable and the model was run allowing \nthis period to vary between 3 years and 2000 years. During each iteration (each using a different \naftercare period) the maximum groundwater concentration for each of the contaminants modelled \nwas recorded and then plotted against aftercare time. In this way, the management time period \nneeded to achieve the water quality standard could be estimated. Any model run that resulted in a \ncontaminant requiring a management period greater than 2000 years was simply recorded as \n>2000. \n \n 4\n In the model it was assumed that leachate pumping at the site continued throughout the \naftercare period maintaining leachate heads at 1 m. Once management ceases, leachate heads were \nallowed to vary. The methodology for this was based on the water balance model incorporated in \nLandSim 2.5 [3]. Leachate levels were expected to increase as a result of cap infiltration and cap \ndeterioration despite the fact that the leakage rate was likely to increase markedly as a result of \ndegradation of the liner system. No account was taken of the prospect of cap breakout of leachate \nas a result of a build-up of leachate head after the end of management control. It was assumed that \nthis possibility was likely to be a further and semi-independent site-specific control on the duration \nof site management. \n \n The European Landfill Directive [4] seeks to minimise leachate production by limiting \nrainfall infiltration and groundwater inflow. It has been shown that appreciable flushing rates are \nimportant for achieving landfill stabilisation [5]. Therefore, simulations were also run as flushing \nsystems with 200 or 500 mm of additional infiltration, to determine the implications for aftercare \nperiods. This recirculation ceases at the time management control ends. The receptors for the \nvarious contaminants were selected as the downgradient boundary of the site for List II or non-\nlisted substances [6] and the base of the unsaturated zone for List I substances.   \n \n Note that, on a site-specific basis, the water quality standards used may not be appropriate, \nas they may be too high (e.g. if the site is in a sensitive location) or too low (e.g. where background \nlevels already exceed these values and the location is not sensitive). Also, certain species, such as \nzinc, are only found in high concentrations in leachates that are acetogenic; concentrations often \nfall below the relevant water quality standards once the waste becomes fully anaerobic.  In this \ninstance, the concentration was modelled at its higher aerobic concentration. It must be stressed \n 5\nthat there will be situations where the leachate strengths will be higher than those used in the \nmodel, and where less attenuating capacity is available. However, the modelling was undertaken \non the basis of mean leachate concentrations (not ranges) and is based on a 50th percentile result \nand not a 95th percentile (which would be the typical percentile used for a risk assessment).  For \neach scenario and each contaminant, the modelling approach allowed for an estimation of the \nleachate strength when management control can end and groundwater impacts are acceptable (i.e. \nless than the Water Quality Standard (WQS)).  \n \nModel inputs \n In all cases the landfill was assumed to be composite lined with a HDPE capping system. \nInfiltration into the open waste mass prior to capping was assumed to be 250 mm y-1 (taken over a \nten year period) reducing to 50 mm y-1 on capping. Infiltration was then allowed to increase from \n50 mm y-1 to 140 mm y-1 between 250 and 1000 years to simulate degradation of the cap. Single \nvalue inputs for the generic site modelled are provided in Tables 1 to 6 below. \n \n Conservative retardation factors (identical to those used for the UK contribution to the \nderivation of EU Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) were used [7]. Ammoniacal nitrogen was not \nincluded in the WAC, so a typical value of 0.5 l kg-1 was chosen. It was assumed that \nbiodegradation of ammoniacal nitrogen did not occur. \n \n There is some uncertainty about the long term viability of kappa values (first order decay \nconstants) as an input variable to the modelling that has been undertaken. Work is currently \nunderway in the UK to derive additional waste characterisation information that will help to \n 6\nunderstand the short-term variability of kappa for some of the contaminants of interest. Only by \nlooking at long-term leachate quality data from landfills where some realistic estimate of the \nliquid\/solid (L\/S) ratio can be made, will any real advance in our understanding of this variable \nbe achieved. We consider that it remains, at this time, the best method of estimating long-term \nleaching behaviour, but it is unlikely to represent the perfect solution and further advances in this \narea should be made over coming years as more date become available. \n \nLeachate source term \n The main contaminants modelled were those that are included in the EU WAC, although \nthe inclusion of ammoniacal nitrogen was necessary, as for some waste streams it will represent \none of the key contaminants in relation to its concentration in leachate and its various water quality \nstandards. The inclusion of ammoniacal nitrogen within the list of contaminants modelled required \nthe derivation of a nominal (and certainly non-statutory) WAC for ammonia. \n \n Data relating to initial leachate concentrations came from a variety of sources. For the \nMechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) residues and incinerator bottom ash, data were derived \nfrom published research [8]. For those model runs relating to WAC values, C0 was taken to be the \ninitial flush from a standard column test equating to a L\/S ratio of approximately 0.05 l kg-1 back \ncalculated from the published WAC.  Additional data were drawn from corporate knowledge and \njudgement. \n \n The initial leachate concentrations used for the modelling of municipal solid waste (MSW) \nand treated MSW (or closely allied wastes) are shown in Table 6, and those for incinerator bottom \n 7\nash (both raw and treated) are shown in Table 7. It should be noted that suitable leachate source \nterms were not identified for all of the ten processes discussed. \n \n The column in Table 6 entitled \u2018Stable Non-Reactive\u2019 relates solely to the C0 values derived \nfrom the WAC for that waste that could be placed in a non-hazardous landfill in a separate cell. \nThe implied assumption was that the entire waste was deposited at the maximum concentration of \neach species. The likelihood of this occurring is very low, but given that individual species were \nbeing examined it did provide an insight into which species are likely to result in the need to \nextend aftercare periods from the processes included. \n \nModel results \n Tables 9, 10 and 11 show a summary of the results of the modelling exercise simply \nindicating, for each waste stream, each landfill management option and each species with the \nnumber of years required to achieve equilibrium status.  For each scenario the model was run \nusing what might be regarded as a standard management option (i.e. the waste remains uncapped \nduring the filling sequence and is then capped). In addition, a flushing scenario where infiltration \nis increased during the management period has been modelled. Whether this is achieved by \nirrigation beneath the cap, by not having a cap, by removing the cap, or via treated leachate \nrecirculation is, to an extent, incidental for modelling purposes. \n \n True equilibrium status for a landfill is only achieved after every contaminant has reached \nequilibrium status. The final row in each table picks up the longest period defined by any species \nwithin the landfill and therefore highlights the one that equilibrium status is dependent upon. \n 8\n \n Table 8 examines raw MSW and a synthetic leachate derived to represent a site filled with \nwaste at its maximum WAC for stable non-reactive waste. This is a slightly fictitious scenario as it \nis highly unlikely that wastes infilling a site would all equal the relevant WAC. However, it is \nconceivable that a process waste might be consistently close to the limit for one of the WAC \nspecies. \n \n The raw MSW waste in the basic scenario (i.e. one where the waste is placed, capped and \nleachate generation minimised) formed the base case. Somewhat surprisingly this scenario \ncontained only one contaminant that failed the general criteria of equilibrium status. It must be \nnoted however that the compliance concentration for cadmium was taken as the drinking water \nstandard and not the Minimum Reporting Value (MRV), albeit that the compliance point was \ntaken as the base of the unsaturated zone. The MRV is the value that is normally applied to List 1 \nSubstances to determine whether their presence is discernible or not, and is enshrined in the UK \ngroundwater risk assessment methodology [9]. If the compliance water quality standard is taken as \nthe MRV, the time for cadmium to reach equilibrium status increases to slightly over 2000 years. \nThe option of disposing of raw MSW to landfill is unlikely to remain as the Landfill Directive seeks \nto reduce the volume of biodegradable MSW being disposed of to landfill. \n \n The flushed raw MSW met the criteria of stabilisation at 40 years, subject to each of the \nleachate species being present at or below their average UK concentrations. After this time it is \ninteresting to note that landfill gas generation would also have ceased (or at least be below the \npoint at which meaningful management could be applied), so the requirements of equilibrium \nstatus would have been met. \n 9\n \n Stable non-reactive wastes meeting the WAC performed badly in the non-flushing scenario, \nwith only two species stabilising within 1000 years and the majority taking in excess of 2000 years. \nThe flushing scenarios showed only a marginal improvement, with arsenic still persisting beyond \n2000 years with an additional 500 mm y-1 of infiltration. \n \nTable 9 shows the results for mechanically and biologically treated waste. Mechanically Sorted \nOrganic Residues (MSOR) generates a waste that is high in contaminants and has high ammonia \nloading. As such, its stabilisation time (without flushing) was high, and even with flushing, arsenic \nand chromium remained a problem. In this case cadmium did not appear to be an issue at either of \nits WQSs. \n \n Two MBT cases were examined, one with medium intensity composting and one with \nhighly intensive composting. Both were subjected to the non-flushing and flushing scenarios. The \nnon-flushing case of both fell short of the basic requirements of equilibrium status within decades. \nHowever, the intense composting option with some minimal flushing appeared to create a scenario \nwhere equilibrium status could be achieved. Cadmium met the MRV at around 400 years in the \nflushed scenario. \n \n The final set of results (Table 10) relate to incinerator bottom ash (raw and subjected to \nvarious treatments). Antimony, copper, chloride and sulphate appeared to be the main controls in \nachieving equilibrium status of this waste stream, irrespective of the treatment type. Flushing at \nhigher rates (500 mm y-1) failed to make a significant reduction in the management period \nrequired. It may be that the source term used was selected with conservatism and that a greater \n 10\nfamiliarity with the material would generate lower mean values of the key contaminants. What is \nclear is that bottom ash on its own will remain a challenge. \n \nLeachate source concentrations at time of equilibrium \n One of the objectives of this work was to determine a test to assist in defining when waste \nhas reached equilibrium status. Leachate quality itself should give an indication of the status of the \nwaste, and it was originally thought that a series of leachate quality criteria could be developed \nthat could be used to define equilibrium status (with respect to leachate). Leachate source \nconcentrations when equilibrium status was attained (based on the results presented in Tables 9, \n10, and 11) were extracted from the data and are presented in Tables 12, 13 and 14. It is clear that \nthere is no single leachate value that dictates equilibrium.  Degradation of the liner and capping \nsystems causes considerable complexity of the relationship between leachate quality with time, \ntransient groundwater quality, and equilibrium. \n \n Overall it would appear from the work undertaken that intensively composted MBT \nresidues that undergo flushing within a landfill will provide one means of achieving equilibrium \nstatus. MBT is gaining in popularity in the UK and Europe. Reports that MBT residues have a low \npermeability do raise some concern. It would not be feasible to irrigate a material with a \npermeability value of 1 x 10-10 m s-1 at a rate of more that 3 mm y-1.  A permeability value of greater \nthan 6 x 10 -9 m s-1 would be required to allow intensively composted MBT residues to meet the \nrequirements of our definition of sustainable landfill (in relation to leachate). \n \n 11\n The result of this is that rather than generating a specific time to achieve equilibrium status, \nthe best that can be achieved is the definition of a broad time scale over which equilibrium status \nmay be achieved. It is further cautioned that there remains some considerable uncertainty with \nthese results and they must be regarded as tentative. \nCONCLUSIONS \n This work has demonstrated that there is no simple relationship between landfill leachate \nquality and equilibrium status. Equilibrium status is achievable for MBT treated waste with \nintensive composting, the residues from which are then landfilled. There is a wide range of \nreported literature values for the permeability of these waste streams and further work is required \nto assess their actual permeability which is likely to be the limiting factor for achieving equilibrium \nstatus. Further work is also needed on the composition and leaching potential of treated waste \nstreams. Data for pyrolysis and gasification processes in particular is lacking, though these are not \nlikely to become dominant strategic options for waste management in the foreseeable future. Data \nis also lacking for the anaerobic digestion of specific waste streams and there are a growing \nnumber of these facilities in the UK in common with Europe.  \n The achievement of equilibrium status for an entire landfill is site-specific and ultimately \nfactors such as size of site and depth of waste are likely to be important. The behaviour of wastes at \ndeep (>50m) landfills is uncertain and appropriate L\/S ratios may not be achieved even with \nleachate recirculation. Robust leachate collection systems in such sites will be essential.  \nThis requires an evaluation of landfill management practice at current landfills so as to \npromote the achievability of equilibrium. For pre-Landfill Directive sites there is likely to be a \nlegacy of long active management periods taking centuries rather than decades. Some of these sites \n 12\nmay ultimately fall under the contaminated land legislative regime. A third manuscript [9] \nconsiders the policy and operational implications of this work. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n This work was jointly funded by the Environment Agency for England and Wales and \nESART.
