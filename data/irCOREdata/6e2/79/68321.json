U.K.\nIltroduction: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are very commonly used\ndrugs. Recent data indicate that they cause more marked elevation of\nintragastric pH in H.P-infected individuals. It is not clear whether this is\ndue to a neutralising effect of ammonia produced by H. pylori urease or to\na more marked inhibition of acid secretion.\nAm: To assess the effet of H. pylori status on acid secretion during PPI\ntherapy.\nSubjects and Methods: I8 H.P -ve and I) H.P.+ve healthy volunteers\nwere studied. H. pylori status was confirmed by the 14C-urea breath test.\nPrior to commencing the PPI therapy, basal acid output, acid output to\ngastrin releasing peptide (40pmoUkg\/h) (GRP) and maximal acid output to\nGastrin-17 (MAO) were measured on separate days. Omeprazole\n40mg\/day was then taken in the morning daily for eight weeks. On\nseparate mornings in the last two weeks ol this course, the acid secretion\nstudies were repeated (24 hours after the last dose).\nH.PY ngative\nPre- On o\nOmep. Omep.

The magnitude of this effect cannot be explained by\nthe neutralising effect Of bactcrial ammonia. It may be explained by the\nbody gastritis which develops in H.P.+vc subjects during PPI therapy\nimpairing acid secrctory function and.thus augmenting the effect of the\ndrug. This profound suppression of acid secretion may have deleterious\neffects by facilitating gastric bactcrial colonisation and consequently\npredisposing to gastric carcinoma. Eradication of H. pylori may be\nappropriate prior to long-tcrm PPI therapy, but this may reducc the efficacy\nof PPI therapy in reflux disease.\nUSE (,F SELF EXPANDABLE STENTS INTHETREATMENT OF\nBENIGN PEPTIC OESOPHAGEAL STRICTURES IN THE\nELDERLY.\nDR D R FOSTER, DEPARTMENTS OF RADIOLOGY AND\nENDOSCOPY, PRINCESS OF WALES HOSPITAL, BRIDGEND,\nSOUTH WALES, U.K.\nThe use of self-expandable stents in the management of malignant\noesophageal strictures has become well established. The majority of\nbenign peptic oesophageal strictures can be successfully managed using\nendoscopic o0 fluoroscopically guided balloon oesophageal dilatation\ncombined with long term drug therapy, particularly using Proton pump\ninhibitors. Although endoscopic oesophageal dilatation can be\nperformed on an outpatient basis it requires repeated hospital visits.\nThere is a small risk of oesophageal perforation whilst cardio-\nrespiratory complications may be encountered during the use of\nintravenous sedation in elderly patients. Self-expandable Strecker\noesophageal stents (Boston Scientific Corporation, Boston) were used\nin three elderly female patients aged 91, 98 and 100 years\nrespectively. All patients had previously required repeated endoscopic\noesophageal dilatations over a 5 year period despite the use of long\nterm Omeprazole therapy. Self-expandable stents were inserted in all\npatients under mild sedation following preliminary stricture dilatation.\nAll patients have obtained excellent relief of symptoms following stent\ninsertion and have now been followed up for approximately 12\nmonths. They are able to swallow normally and have continued on\nlong term maintenance Omeprazole therapy. There is a theoretical\nrisk of developing an additional peptic stricture above the stent but this\nis unlikely to be a signiFican' problem in these patients with the use\nof long term Omeprazole therapy and their likely life expectancy.\nTHE EFFECTS OF NaMETHYLHISTAMINE ON GASTRIC ACID\nSECRETION IN HUMAN VOLUNTEERS\nBliss PW. and Calam I\nDepartqmt of Gastoentrology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School,\nHa s Hospital, London UK\nBackground: Helicobacferpylori (Hp) produces Na Methyl Histamine.\n(NaMH). Ih effects ofthis substance on the physiolo ofthe human\nstonach is unknown. NaMH is an agonist ofboth H2 and H3 receptors. Its\nhistamine H3 agonist effect is expected to inhibit n ol -like cells\nwhich might decreas acid secretion. However we find that it simulates rabbit\npaietal cells via hisam H2-receptors, and also releases gastin from rabbit\nG-cells. Therefore we investgated the oveUrall effect of lumenal NaMH on\nacid secretion and gastrin releas in human volunteers.\nMethods: Volunteers fasted ovemight. Terfenadine, 120mg, was given 1 hour\nbefore the study to block hisamie Hi-receptor effects. A nasogstric tube\nwas passed and connected to an automated syringe device to ensure adequate\nmixing ofthe gastric contents. Gastric acid output was measured by\ncontinuous intra-pstric tition ofa 5.8% glucose solution to pH 5.0. The\nintragastric solution was changed every 30 min. NaMH was added at 104M,\nl1-1 M, and l06 M, with basal periods before each dose. Blood was collected\nfor gastrin assay. Hp status was deermined by '4C Urea breath test.\nResuls: Elven volunteers took part; 5 female and 6 male. Four were infected\nwith Hp. In the Hp neptive group NaMH stimulated acid output from a basal\nvalue of 3.8 \u00b1 1.3 (mnwl\/h mean + SEM), to 5.2 \u00b1 2.1 at l0-6M (NSD) and\n6.0 \u00b1 1.7 at lO-' M (P<0.05 vs. basal). NaMH 10-4 M produced no further\nrise. By way of cotast, inital results in the Hp positive group showed a\nhigher basal acid output; 7.5 \u00b1 2.7 (P<0.05 vs. uninfcted) and no response to\nNaMH; 5.1 \u00b1 1.9 at IO-' M. Fasting plasma gastrin concentatons were 7.5 \u00b1\n1.5 pmol\/l in uninfrtd subjects compared to 30.5 \u00b1 7.9 pmol\/l in infected\nsubjects(P<0.05). NaMH had no significant eflct on plasma gastrin levels.\nCoodusion: The H. pylon product NaMH stimulated acid socretion in Hp\nnegative subjects when infiLsed into the gastric lumen. No effect was seen on\ngastrin relase. By corast Hp postive patients had higher basal acid output\nand did not respond to NaMH. Thus NcxMH may contribute to the elevated\nbasal acid output seen in H. pyloni infection.\nNEW, INTERNATIONALLY APPLICABLE, POLYMERASE\nCHAIN REACTION-BASED TYPING OF Helicobacter pyloyi vacA.\nJC Atherton, RJ Twells, CJ Hawkey, RM Peek Jr.*,TL Cover*, MJ\nBlaser*. Div.Gastroenterology and Institute of Inections and Immunity,\nUniversity of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, *Div. Infectious\nDiseases, Vanderbilt University and VAMC, Nashville, USA.\nTyping H. pylon vacA is important because, in the US, vacA structure\nhas been associated with gastric epithelial damage and ulceration. A\nprevious PCR-based typing system successfully classified all U.S. strains\ntested, but failed to classify vacA mid-regions of Japanese and various\nother strains. We sought to investigate the extent of vacA mid-region\ndiversity between US strains and strains from other countries, and to\ndevise an internationally applicable typing system.\nMethods and Results: We studied 78 H. pylori isolates of which\n13\/13 Japanese, 2\/6 Chinese, 3\/9 Thai, 1\/8 Peruvian and 0\/42 US\nisolates had vacA mid-regions we could not previously classify. We\nPCR-amplified, cloned and sequenced, extended (1.7Kb) vacA mid-\nregions of 1-2 untypeable strains from each country. All proved to be\ntype ml variants except one Chinese strain which was ml proximally and\nm2 distally with a clear crossover site. Annealing sites for the\nunsuccessful ml primers had up to 3\/19 and 7\/20 non-complementary\nbases. vacA sequence comparisons using these strains, m2 strains from\nthe same populations, and other published strains, showed that diversity\nwas greater among ml strains (1-12% nucleotide differences over 294bp)\nthan m2 (0-6%), but that differences were most marked between ml and\nm2 strains (22-27%). Next, we devised two new PCR-based typing\nstrategies. The first used conserved primers spanning a 75bp imperfect\nrepeat found only in m2 strains, and differentiated products by size. The\nsecond used four primers in a single reaction: two new ml primers and\ntwo previously described m2 primers. We applied both strategies to all\n78 isolates. Results agreed entirely with previous vacA typing, except\nthat for both strategies all previously untypeable strains were ml. As\nexpected, the Chinese ml\/m2 strain appeared ml by strategy 1 and gave\na uniquely sized product (of the predicted size) using strategy 2.\nCclusions: Despite variability in the vacA mid-region, all strains can\nbe typed as ml or m2. Finding an intermediate ml\/m2 type implies in\nvivo recombination between strains. This typing system will aid studies\nlinking vacA genotype with disease in countries other than the US.\nAl\nResults:\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nStomach and duodenum W7-W32\nW7TUS\nTU6 W8\nVIRULENT HELICOBACTER PYLORI (HP) IN PATIENTS WITH\nGASTRIC AND OESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA.\nCE Grinley, DE Loft, AG Morris, CU Nwokolo.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, UK.\nIntroduction Gastric carcinogenesis can be explained by a model based on\nHP-mediated inflammation facilitating progression from gastritis to atrophy,\ndysplasia and cancer. Mucosal inflammation which occurs when HP colonises\nthe stomach is more severe when the strains express CagA and VacA. IfHP-\nmediated inflammation is the main pathogenetic factor in gastric carcinogenesis,\nthen virulent proinflammatory strains ofHP should be over represented among\npatients with gastric cancer when compared to other disease groups in which\nHP inflammation is not a factor.\nMethod: In an unselected series ofpatients with gastric (GA) or oesophageal\n(OA) adenocarcinoma, HP status was determined by serology\/'3C-UBT\/CLO-\ntest\/histology. CagA and VacA status ofthe colonising HP was determined\nindirectly by deteing antibodies to these proteins in patients sera by an\nimmunoblot assay. Using a novel virulence scoring system, a putative HP\nvirulence load was assigned to each patient depending on whether they were\ncolonised by HP and whether the TP strain they harboured expressed either\nCagA or VacA or both virulence factors. Virulence load increased in a stepwise\nfashion: - patients scored 0 ifHP-ve, 1 if HP+ve and -ve for CagA and VacA, 2\nifHP+ve and ako-+ve for either CagA or VacA and 3 ifHP+ve and also +ve\nfor CagA and VacA.\nResults : GA (n=26) OA (n=26), median age were 74 and 67 respectively. In\nthe GA group 21\/26 patients were HP+ve and 19\/21 harboured strains which\nwere +ve for CagA or\/and VacA. In the OA group 14\/26 were HP+ve and only\n7\/14 harboured strains +ve for CagA or\/and VacA. When our virulence scoring\nsystem was used to assign virulence\/inflammatory load, patients with GA\nscored a median of 2 (range 0-3) compared with OA patients who scored I\n(range 0-3), p=0.0016 Mann-Whitney U Test.\nConclusion : Compared to an OA control group, the majority ofpatients with\nGA are colonised by virulent pro-infammatory strains ofHP. This study\nsupports the HP inflammatory model for gastric carcinogenesis. An altemative\ninterpretation could be that colonisation by virulent BP protects against\noesoplsageal adenocarcinoma.\nVALUE OF THE HELISAL TEST IN SCREENING DYSPEPTIC\nPATIENTS FOR H.PYLORI INFECTION-. A.inha, C.Treharne,\nL.Murray, D.W.Williams, M.J.Dew, Prince Philip Hospital, Llanelli.\nIntroduction: H.Pylori antibody seropositivity as determined by\nlaboratory based ELISA tests or ELISA kits has been proposed as a\nscreening test for H.Pylori infection in dyspeptic patients without\nsinister symptoms, especially those below 45 years, with diagnostic\nendoscopy offered to only the seropositive group. The Helisal test\n(Cortecs diagnostics), which is one such Rapid Whole Blood Test, is\nincreasingly being used in general practice for this purpose. This study\nassesses the reliability ofthis approach.\nAim: To assess the value of the Helisal test in screening dyspeptic\npatients for H.Pylori infection.\nMethods: 207 consecutive patients (102 male, 105 female) referred\nfor Open Access endoscopy were tested immediately before endoscopy.\nSerum samples were obtained for a reference laboratory based ELISA\ntest for H.Pylori antibodies. Infection was confirmed ifCLO test at 24\nhours and microscopic visualisation ofthe organism on biopsy were\nboth positive, and excluded if both were negative.\nResults:. H.Pylori infection found in 69\/187 (36.9%) patients [Age <\n45 - 13\/39 (33.3%); Age >= 45 - 56\/138 (40.58%)]. The Helisal test\nhad a sensitivity of 0.84, but a specificity of only 0.46 [ Positive\npredictive value (PPV) 0.43, Negative predictive value (NPV)\n0.75,False positive rate (FPR) 0.54, False negative rate (FNR) 0.16,\nLikelihood ratio (LR) 1.56]. The laboratory ELISA test had a\nsensitivity 0.84, but the specificity was 0.79 [ PPV 0.62 NPV 0.82, FPR\n0.21, FNR 0.16, LR 4]. Correlation of Helisal test with Laboratory\nbased ELISA test was poor. Both tests performed similarly in the <45\ngroup and the >45 group.\nConclusion: Ofthe 122 patients that had a positive Helisal test in this\nstudy, 64 (52.46%) were falsely positive. Reliance on a negative Helisal\nresult to restrict endoscopy would have resulted in 16% (11\/69) cases of\nH. Pylori infection being missed. The poor performance of this test\nmakes it unsuitable for use in screening for H.Pylori infection.\nTHE PROLIFERATIVE STATUS OF ENTEROCHROMAFFIN-LIKE(ECL) CELLS IN THE GASTRIC MUCOSA; THE PLOT THICKENS\nNeema M Rashid, Irvin Modlin, Laura Tang and Nicholas A Wrijht,Department of Histopathology RPMS, Hammersmith Hospital, London\nand Gastric Pathobiology Research Group, West Haven VAMC and Yale.\nThere has been considerable interest in ECL cell hyperplasia, in recent\nyears, mainly because of concern that powerful antisecretory therapy may\nlead to the development of ECL cell carcinoids. The mechanism of\ndevelopment of ECL cell hyperplasia in chronic atrophic gastritis, whether\nor not the patient is on antisecretory therapy, has been assumed to be due\nto proliferation of the ECL cells themselves; this is because of findings in\nexperimental animals that indicate that the ECL cell lineage is a self-\nrenewing population. There is little or no direct experimental evidence,\nhowever, on the proliferative status of this important lineage in the human\nstomach.\nConsequently, we have examined the fundic gastric mucosa of normal\nhumans, patients on long-term antisecretory therapy, and patients with\natrophic gastritis showing diffuse, linear and micronodular hyperplasia,\nand with ECL cell carcinoids. In addition, we evaluated fundic mucosa\nfrom Mastomys, an important animal model for ECL cell hyperplasia and\nneoplasia: control animals, animals with ECL cell hyperplasia and ECL\ncell carcinoids induced by loxtidine were available. All tissues were\ndouble-immunostained using chromogranin A as an endocrine cell\nmarker, and PCNA and MIB- I as proliferative markers.\nWe were unable to demonstrate double-labelled cells in normal human\ncorpus or in patients with diffuse, linear or micronodular hyperplasia,\ndespite counting in excess of 20,000 chromogranin A positive cells in\neach group. However, ECL cell carcinoids in humans contain numbers of\ndouble-labelled cells (up to 0.15%). However, Mastomys corpus contains\nproliferative ECL cells, as previously reported, and we demonstrated that\nup to 3% of chromogranin positive cells were double-stained in ECL cell\nhyperplasia, and 4% in ECL cell carcinoids.\nWe conclude that (i) as assessed by chromogranin A, neither normal nor\nhyperplastic ECL cells in the human stomach appear to have proliferative\npotential; (ii) Mastomys ECL cells form a renewing population and\nundergo hyperplasia after loxtidine-induction which involves cell division,\nwhich may reflect different rates of cell tumover in each species. These\nrindings indicate (a) that the mechanism of ECL cell hyperplasia in the\nhuman stomach does not involve proliferation of ECL cells themselves,\nalthough neoplastic ECL cells themselves can divide, and (b) that lineage\nrelationships in the human and animal stomach differ. The mastomys\nmodel thus apears appropriate for studies of ECL cell proliferation.\nOne year follow-up of a randonused trial of pre endoscopy screening\nfor H. pyloA in the management of dyspepsia.\nMA Asante M Mendall, P Patel, L Ballamn and TC Northfield.\nDept. ofMedicine, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London. UK.\nBackground: The safety and savings in endoscopy derived from not endoscoping H.\npylori seronegative dyspeptic patients has been demonstrated in short term studies of\nsix month duration. The long term outcome of such a management strategy is not clear\nwhat. We report the final 12 month follow-up in a prospective randomised trial. for\nwhich we reported Interim results of this study has already been presented to the\nsociety. Design: 417 patients under the age of 45 years referred to a direct access\nendoscopy service were screened with a validated questionnaire and H. pylori serology(Helico-G ELISA). A cut off level of 6.3u\/ml had been previously determined to be\nsuitable for screening. 154 patients (56% male) had serology titres below 6.3u\/ml and\nwere randomised to have either endoscopy or no endoscopy. All patients were\nreturned to their GPs for further management. Patients with a history of weight loss of\nmore than 1\/2 stone in 6 months, dysphagia, anaemia or persistent vomiting or on\nregular NSAIDs were excluded. Six and twelve month assessment was carried out by\npostal questionnaire.\nReslts: 120\/154 (79%) and 82\/154 (53%) questionnaires were returned at 6 and 12\nmonthsrespectively. Table shows results at 12 months expressed as medians.\nEndoscopy (43) No Endoscopy (39) P\nSymptomscore I I NS\nDisability score 0 I NS\nDays off work 0 0 NS\nGP visit 0 0 NS\nPrescriptions score 0 NS\nSelf medications score 0 1 0.05\nSpecialist referral 6\/38 (16%) 13\/34 (38%) 0.06\nEndoscopy referral (n) 6\/39 (15%)\nSummary: There were no significant differences in symptoms, disability, GP visits\nand prescriptions between the two groups. 46%(6\/13) of the non endoscoped group\nreferred for specialist consultations were endoscoped. At one year 85% of\nendoscopies were saved.\nConclusions: It is safe and more cost effective in the long term to manage young\nH. pylori negative dyspeptic patients without endoscopy.\nA2\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW9\nMARKED REBOUND ACID HYPERSECRETION FOLLOWING\nOMEPRAZOLE THERAPY IN H. PYLORI NEGATIVE\nSUBJECTS. D. Gillen, A. Win, K.E.L. McColl. Univ. Dept. of\nMedicine & Therapeutics, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, U.K.\nIntroduction: Rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid is a well\nestablished class effect of H2-antagonists. Previous studies have\nsuggested that this phenomenon does not occur with proton pump\ninhibitors (PPIs). However, the effect may have been masked by PPI\ninduced H. pylon body gastritis.\nAims: To establish whether rebound acid hypersecretion occurs\nwith PPIs when subjects are stratified by H. pylon (H.P.) status.\nSubjects and Methods: 11 H.P.-ve and 7 H.P.+ve healthy\nvolunteers were examined. Their H.P. status was determined by the\n14C-urea breath test. Their basal acid output (BAO) and G17\nstimulated maximal acid output (MAOG17) and maximal acid output in\nresponse to gastrin releasing peptide (MAOoRP) were measured before and 2\nweeks after completing a 2 month course of omeprazole 40mg\/day.\nResults and Discussion:\nH.P negative H.P positive\nPre-omep.

There was no rebound hypersecretion of acid in the\nH.P.+ve subjects and this may be due to the body gastritis occurring\nin H.P.+ve subjects during omeprazole therapy impairing gastric acid\nsecretion and thus masking the rebound phenomenon.\nConclusion: There is marked rebound hypersecretion of gastric\nacid following PPI therapy in H. pylori-negative, but not H.\npylori-positive subjects.\nw10 v\nRANITIDINE TREATMENT INDUCES DYSPEPSIA IN\nPREVIOUSLY ASYMPTOMATIC HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.\nA.Smith, D. Gillen, K. Cochran, E. El-Omar, K.E.L. McColl.\nUniversity Dept. of Medicine & Therapeutics, Western Infirmary &\nVictoria Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland.\nBackground: Dyspeptic symptoms frequently rapidly recur\nfollowing cessation of H receptor antagonist therapy. We have\npreviously shown that in A. pylori +ve healthy volunteers basal and\ngastrin releasing peptide (GRP) stimulated acid secretion are\nincreased by 96% and 56% respectively 3 days after completing a\ntwo month course of ranitidine 300mg nocte compared to\npre-treatment values (Am. J. Gastroenterol., 1996; 91: 355-359). It is\nunknown whether this rebound acid hypersecretion causes dyspeptic\nsymptoms.\nAim: To determine whether cessation of H2 antagonist treatment\nresults in the de novo development and\/or aggravation of dyspepsia.\nSubjects and Methods: Thirty H. pylori positive healthy volunteers\nwere randomised in a double blind fashion to receive either ranitidine\n300mg nocte or placebo tablets for two months. All subjects had H.\npylori infection confirmed using serology and 13C-urea breath test.\nThe two groups were matched for age, sex, body weight, smoking\nand alcohol consumption. Dyspeptic symptoms were measured using\na validated questionnaire. Symptoms were scored for one week prior\nto entry into the study and for the 10 days following cessation of the\ntreatment.\nResults: Compliance was similar in the two groups (active 95%,\nplacebo 98%, p=NS). The mean dyspepsia score before treatment\nwas 0.86 in the active group and 0.53 in the placebo group (p=NS).\nThe mean dyspepsia score for the 10 days after stopping treatment\nwas 5.4 (range 0-30) in the active group and 0.93 (range: 0-9) in the\nplacebe group (p<0.03). 53% experienced dyspepsia in the 10 day\nperiod following active therapy versus 13% following placebo.\nConclusions: These results indicate that a two month course of\nranitidine 300mg nocte is followed by the development of new\ndyspeptic symptoms in H. pyloA positive healthy volunteers. This\nfinding indicates that rebound acid hypersecretion following\nwithdrawal of H2 antagonist therapy is of clinical significance. It is\nnow important to determine whether the dyspepsia is due to the\nrebound acid hypersecretion causing acute peptic ulceration.\nREFLUX SYMPTOMS IN THE LONG TERM FOLLOW UP OF\nPATIENTS AFTER HELICOBACTER PYLORI ERADICATION\nAE Griffiths, MR Thursz, D Pryce, MM Walker. Departments of\nGastroenterology and Histopathology, Imperial College School of\nMedicine at St Mary's, Norfolk Place, London W2.\nBackground Symptomatic relapse after H. pylon (Hp) eradication in\nduodenal ulcer (DU) patients is common and is only rarely due to proven\nulcer recurrence. Recent reports suggest that eradication ofHp is\nassociated with the onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\none to two years later.\nMethods A questionnaire was sent to 85 individuals who had completed a\nsimilar questionnaire 2 years previously, just prior to Hp eradication. This\nincluded questions about symptomatology, medication, weight and\nsmoking and alcohol history. Eradication was confirmed by 13C urea\nbreath test at follow up.\nResults 45 patients returned the questionnaire (53% response). 32 were\nfrom patients known to have cleared Hp; 20 ofthese had DU originally,\n19 were male and median age was 55 (range 25-79). The remaining 13\nreplies were from patients who had not cleared Hp (5 patients) or in\nwhom a breath test result was unavailable (8 patients); 3 had DU, 5 were\nmale and median age was 57 (range 32-82). In the Hp eradicated group\nwith DU 9\/20 (45%) had heartbumJreflux symptoms at 2 years follow up.\nHowever 17 (85%) had these symptoms prior to treatment. In the non-\nDU, Hp eradicated patients the figures were similar with 75% having\nheartburn pre-treatment and 42% at 2 years. In the non-eradicated group\nthe corresponding frequencies of heartburn were 54% initially and 380\/o at\n2 years. No individual in any group developed heartbum\/reflux symptoms\nduring 2 years of follow up. Other findings were that 65% of 32\nsuccessfully treated patients remained symptomatic at follow up, with\n53% still requiring medication, chiefly antacids. 9% stated that their\nsymptoms are worse now than they were before treatment. Changes in\nweight or in alcohol consumption had no bearing on current symptoms\nthough increased cigarette smoking was associated with fewer symptoms.\nConclusions Contrary to previous reports we have found no evidence of\nnew symptoms ofGORD in the long-term follow up of patients\nundergoing Hp eradication for DU or for other Hp related conditions.\nREGULATION OF CORPUS MUCOSAL FUNCTION IN H.P.\nINFECTED DU PATIENTS VERSUS HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.\nD. Gil. E. El-Omar, A. Wirz, J.E.S. Ardill, KE.L. McColl. Univ. Dept.\nof Medicine & Therapeutics, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, U.K.\nIntroduction: We have demonstrated a two-fold greater acid response to\ngastrin in DU patients compared to H.P+ve healthy volunteers (H.1V).\nAim: To determine wher the increased acid response in DU patients is\ndue to difference in (1) parietal cell mass (PCM), (2) sensitivity to gastrin,\n(3) inhibitory control or (4) combination of these.\nSubjects and Methods: 34 H.P-ve HVs, 19 H.P.+ve HVs and 18\nH.P.+ve DU patients were examined. On separate mornings, after a 30\nminute basal acid collection, either 7, 20, 60, 180 and 800pmolKg-'h'1 of\nGastrinl7 or 7, 20, 60 and 120pmolKg1lh-1 of CCK8 were infused\nintravenously over 30 minute periods with corresponding acid collections.\nPlasma for gastrin estimation was collected at the end of each infusion\nperiod. Plasma gastrin was then plotted against acid output by computer\ngenerated Langmuir Plot to give the D5o (sensitivity to gastrin) and E-max\n(PCM). CCK simultaneously stimulates acid secretion via the gastrin\n(CCKB) receptor and inhibits it by stimulating somatostatin release via the\nCCKA receptor on D cells in body mucosa. The maximal acid output\n(MAO) to CCK8 as percentage of MAO to G17 is thus a measure of\nsomatostatin mediated inhibitory control.\nResults: HP-ve HVs HP+ve HVs HP+ve DUs\nE-max 35.3 38.5 47.3*(mmolb'1) (21.3-67.3) (17.2-65.0) (18.2-73.7)\nD50 75.1 164.0** 69.8(ngL') (17.7410) (44.8-368) (26.2-142)\nMAOccK 26.2% 16.2%*** 36.6%\nMAOG17 (5.9 - 85.8) (0-46.9) (21.5-58.2)\nValues are medians with ranges in parenthesis. *Indicltes different from\nH.P-ve HV at p<0.05. ** Indicates different from H.P-ve HV at p<0.001.\n*** Indicates different from H.R+ve DU at p<0.02.\nThe higher acid response to gastrin in H.P.+ve DU patients versus\ninfected d.V is predominantly due to a reduced sensitivity to gastrin in the\ninfected HVs when compared with both DU patients and uninfected HVs\n(i.e. true normals). This reduced sensitivity to gastrin in the infected\nnon-ulcer subjects may be due to H. pylon body gastritis. The DU patients\nalso had a slightly increased PCM. There was no evidence of impaired\nCCK mediated inhibitory control of body function in the DU patients. The\napparently enhanced inhibitory control in the H.P+ve HV can be explained\nby their lesser sensitivity to gastrin.\nConclusion: The two-fold difference in acid response to gastrin\nstimulation in the H.P.+ve DU patients versus H.P.+ve HV is\npredominantly due to impaired sensitivity to gastrin in the infected HVs.\nA3\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW13 W15\nNON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMKATORY DRUGS AND THE NATURAL HISTORY OF NON-NSAID GASTRC ULCER\nHELI'COBACERPYLORIIAS INDEPENDENT RISK FACTORS FOR DISEASE FOLLOWVING H.

The aim of this study\nwas to compare the health care costs over one year in two groups of\npatients with chronic DU who received either Hp eradication therapy or\nmaintenance therapy using ranitidine. Methods. Patients with active Hp\ninfection were randomised to receive either 150mg ranitidine, daily [n =\n58] or, Hp eradication [n = 61] using OAM (omeprazole 40mg\/d,\namoxycillin 2G\/d, metronidazole 1.2G\/d; for 14 days), or OC\n(omeprazole 40mg\/d, clarithromycin 1.5G\/d; for 14 days), if penicillin-\nallergic.

Public Health Medicine, Leeds, UK\nIntroduction: H pylori therapy is usually given for at least 7\ndays. A shorter regimen would be cheaper and better tolerated. We\nhave investigated the optimum 5 day therapy with various\ncombinations of lansoprazole 30 mg bd (L), clarithromycin 250 mg\nbd (C), amoxycillin 1 g bd (A) and metronidazole 400 mg bd (M).\nMethods: Patients attending the dyspepsia clinic who were H pylori\npositive as assessed by histology, rapid urease test, microbiology and\n'3C-urea breath test (\"C-UBT) were randomised to receive 5 days of\neither LCM, LAC or LACM. The investigator was blinded to the\ntreatment group. Success of treatment was evaluated by '3C-UBT at\nleast 4 weeks after completion of therapy. Results: 143 patients\nwere recruited to the study (mean age 53 \u00b1 14 years, range 21-80,\n52% male). Culture was successful 84% of cases with 51%\nharbouring metronidazole resistant strains. There was no statistical\ndifference in age, gender or smoking between the 3 groups.\nEradication rates were higher in the LCM group (38\/45 - 84%) than\nthe LAC group (29\/47 - 62%; p=0.02 Fisher's exact test). LCM was\nless effective against metronidazole resistant organisms (eradication\nrate 13\/19-68%) than sensitive organisms (13\/14 - 93%). Treatment\nwas successful in 46\/51 (90%) patients taking LACM. There was a\ntrend towards adverse events being more common in the LACM\ngroup (50%) than the LCM or LAC groups (36%) but this did not\nreach statistical significance (p=0.2 x2). Conclusions: LCM is more\neffective than LAC in eradicating H pylori. Adding amoxycillin to\nLCM may improve efficacy but increase adverse events. Five days\nof LCM appears as efficacious as 7 day regimens for metronidazole\nsensitive strains of H pylori but is less effective against resistant\norganisms.\nRANITIDINE BISMIUTH CITRATE PLUS CLARITHROMYCIN\nAND TETRACYCLINE: A SEVEN-DAY HELICOBACTER\nPYLORI ERADICATION REGIMEN. M Williams. J Sercombe, R E\nPounder, Royal Free Hospital School ofMedicine, London NW3 2QG.\nIntroduction: The ideal regimen for treating Helicobacter pylori (H.\npylon) infection needs to be simple, short duration and well tolerated. It\nshould give reproducible and high levels of eradication on an\n\"intention-to-treat\" basis. Dual therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate\nplus clarithromycin for fourteen days is a highly effective regimen for\neradicating H. pylori infection.\nAim: To determine whether, with the addition of a second antibiotic,\nit may be possible to reduce the duration of treatment with ranitidine\nbismuth citrate to seven days and yet maintain a high eradication rate.\nMethods: A total of 48 dyspeptic patients were enrolled to this open\ntreatment study. All were infected with H. pylon, as determined by 3C\nurea breath test +\/- a rapid urease test at endoscopy. Patients were\ntreated with twice daily ranitidine bismuth citrate 400mg,\nclarithromycin 500mg and tetracycline hydrochloride 50mng, all for 7\ndays. H. pylon eradication was assessed by 13C urea breath test at least\n28 days after the completion oftreatment. Adverse events were assessed\nby patient interview with all events mentioned, either sponteneously or\non direct questioning, considered significant.\nResults: Successful eradication of H.pylori was achieved in 43\/48\n(90%\/6). Compliance was >90%h in 47\/48 (98%): 1 patient stopped\ntreatment after 2 days due to vomiting. Minor adverse events were\nreported by 24 of the remaining 47 patients (51%) - these were loose\nstools (31%), nausea (17%), taste disturbance (10%), vomiting (2%),\nsore mouth (2%) and vaginal candida (2%).\nConclusion: Triple therapy with ranitidine bismuth citrate 400mg,\nclarithromycin 500mg and tebtacycline 500mg, all twice daily for seven\ndays, is a safe well-tolerated treatment regimen that eradicates H. pylon\ninfection in 900\/o ofpatients on a strict intention-to-treat analysis.\nA5\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW21\nEFFECT OF H.

Tne role\nof Helicobacter pylon (H.pylor) as a possible patogenic factor of NSAID-induced gastropathy remains controversial. Aim: This study wasdesigned 1) to evoke the gastric adaptation in response to repeated\nexposure to ASA in the same subjects before and atr eradication ofH.pbyon and 2) to examine the morphological and functional changes ofgastric mucosa during the 14 days treatment with ASA in subjects with\nand without the presence of H.pylon infection. Material and Methods:\nEight healfthy volunteers (age 19-27) with H.pylri infection and no\nOastrointestinal symptoms were given ASA lg b.i.d. during 14 days.\nucosa mae was evaluated by endoscopy on the 3rd, 7th and 14thday usi modified Lanza score. uring each endosoopy mucosal bloodflow was measured using laser-Doppler flowmete. mucal biopsies\nwere obtained for estimation of DNA synthesis by measuring H-thyidineincorporation into DNA. Prior to each endoscopy the gastric microbeZing\nwas determined in three consecutive gastric washings. Three months\nafter successful eradicati%o of H.pylon (amoxicillin + clarithromycin +lansoprazole) confirmed by C-urea breath test and mucosal rapid urease(CLO) test the same subjects received again the 14 days treatment withASA at the same dosage and underwent the same examinations as priorto the antimicrobial therapy (lansoprazole+ amoxicillin+clarithromycin).\nResults: In subjects with H.pylon infection ASA induced acute gastnc\nmucosal damage mainly in gastric corpus; the endoscopic Lanza score\nreached maximum at 3rd day and remained unchanged at 7th and 14thday of ASA treatment. After H.pylon eradication ASA-induced acutegastic mucosal damage also reached its maximum at 3rd day but theneclined to fall on day 14 to about 25% of initial peak thus confirming the\noccurrence of adaptation. Mucosal blood flow was significantly higherbefore than after H.py\/on eradication and in both cases it significantlyincreased on 3rd and 7th day. Before ASA administration DNA synthesis\nwas similar in subjects before and after eradication of H.pylon, howeverthe DNA synthesis rate showed significant increase on day 7 of ASA\nadministration only in H.pylon eradicated subjects. Gastric microbleeding\nreached its maximum on the 3rd day of ASA treatment being significantlyhiQher in H.pylon-eradicated subjects than in those with H.pylon infection\nThis microbleeding decreased to almost normal values by end of the\nstudy in H.pylon-eradicated subjects but remained significantly elevated in\nH.pylon infected subjects. Conclusions: 1) Gastric adaptation to ASA isimpaired in H.pylon-positive subjects but eradication of H.pylori restores\nthe adapation and 2) DNA synthesis and possibly also mucosal celltumover in response to ASA are suppressed in H.pylon-infected patients\nand this can be reversed by eradicaton of H.pylon.\nMOTI S OF ULCE AND NON-ULCER ASSOCAIA D STRAIS OF\nHdirobadarlouw M Work, L Asion, RL Sidebotham*, RPH Loga* andQN Karin, Deprmts of Microbiolgy and Gatroenterology*, St. Majy's\nHo aMedical School, London,\nBackground Motility is a colonization faictor for Helicobacter pylon (lp),\npresimbly becau it enables the bactenum to cross the viscid cuiws layer to\nthe nmcosal siae where it damages epithelial cels by attacmet and\ncytotoxien relase.

None had Barrett's oesophagus.\nHp status was assessed using Cresyl Violet stains. Intestinal metaplasia\nwas defined as the presence of Goblet cells seen on Haematoxylin &\nEosin and Periodic Acid Schiff Alcian Blue stains. Patients were\ninterviewed regarding duration of acid suppression therapy. Results: 62\npatients had intestinal metaplasia at the OGJ, with Hp at the antrum in\n65% and OGJ in 43.5%.

Little is known, however, about a possible\nrelationship between such disturbances and the bacterial strains.\nAim of this study was to assess whether gastric function parameters\nand dyspeptic symptoms are related to CagA status.\nMethods. 38 consecutive pts with HP-positive NUD were examined.\nThey had suffered from dyspepsia for > 6 months and none of them\nhad macroscopic lesions at upper GI endoscopy. HP positivity was\ndetermined bN means of histology and urease rapid test on antralbiopsies and C-urea breath test. No pt had undergone previous anti-\nHP therapy and any medication was discontinued at least 3 weeks\nprior to the study. Dyspeptic symptoms were classified into 3 different\ncategories according to the predominant complaint, and scored for\nseverity from 0 to 3. In all subjects basal (BAO) and pentagastrin\nstimulated acid output (MAO), fasting and meal-induced gastrin\nconcentrations, fasting pepsinogen I (PG I) levels and gastric\nemptying of solids (by means of ultrasounds) were measured. CagA\nstatus was determined indirectly by assaying serum CagA IgG\nantibodies by commercial Westem-Blotting (Helico-Blot,Genelabs).\nResults. 17 of 38 NUD pts were CagA seropositive (45%). Mean BAO\nand MAO values of CagA seropositive pts (3.0\u00b12.8 and 20.4\u00b17.6\nmmol\/h,respectively) were comparable to those of seronegative pts\n(3.8\u00b12.5 and 23.5\u00b17.3). No significant differences were found in\nfasting (55.9\u00b114.4 vs 57.2\u00b111.6 pg\/mI) and stimulated gastrin levels\n[23370 (AUC) vs 21719] between the two groups. Similarly, gastric\nemptying of solids as well as the type and severity of dyspeptic\nsymptoms did not significantly differ in the two groups of pts. In\ncontrast, fasting PG I levels were higher in seropositive than\nseronegative pts (98.8\u00b133 vs 79.4\u00b132.6 ng\/ml, p=0.07), concomitantly\nwith a higher degree of antral inflammation at histology.\nConclusions. Our findings indicate that gastric function disturbances\nassociated with HP infection and the type and severity of symptoms\nin NUD pts are independent of bacterial CagA status.\nDETECTION OFHELICOBACTER PYLORIFROM GI\nSECRETIONS USING PCR.\nA.O o J.HoIo, D.Gamn2, A.Bot, P.Boulos, MhHobslcy.\nDepts. ofSurgery, Microiolokgy andEastman Dental Insh&W,\nUnivrsity Coee LxmdonMedical Sckhe London\n- 0dOrakrand oral-fcal sad hae been\nu_I~eo X the routc of -_ion ofHeicbacterpykiri(HP).\nHowever, thesuce and route oft Onfsnre nal\nAMmTo i e serei imn th uppa (I tract for\ntra.mun,Iio potentian HP infectio\nMtd- Sixty patient rfened for rouine nd for\ndysppic sympton were sudid 3 stric biopsie wer taken for\nculture and he rapid urease tes Gt juice and d D 2)\naspirte wee collecd for culu and PCR.\nRai\nHPpevaence (%I n = 60\nC PCR UrcFc tea\nGastric biopsy 20(33%) 33(55%) 21(35%)\nGastricjuie 0 9(15%)\nDuodenal ap. 0 5(8%) -\nIn sumiay, HP could not be cvuured from the secretou, but it\nwas culured fiom 33% of the gatric antral biopsies.

Aspirates\nfirm the uninfected subject wer all negative by both methods.\nCondcusion: 1. Isolation ofHp from the gastric aspirtes ofHp infected\nsubjects is inhibited by URTF overowing Hp colonies. 2. The addition of\nacid in viro facilitat the isolation ofHp, by inhibitingURTF. 3. Decreasing\nintagastric acidity in viw, using omeprazole, does not affect the isolation of\nHp using the HCI-KCI method Ti suggests that the apparent inhibition of\nHp culture by omeprazole is due to competition from URTF.\nA7\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW31\nW32\nFor abstract W32A see page A83.\nW29\nW30\nA NEW MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGICAL\nTECHNIQUE FOR GASTRIC LEIOMYOMAS.\n.CC.Hpwonrh, J.Muthusani, D.Menzies, R.W.Motson. Colchester\nDistrict General Hospital, Colchester, Essex UK.\nA new surgical technique has been developed for dealing with\ngastric leiomyomas. This is perfod under a general anaesthetic\nand with the patient supine. The patient is gastroscoped to assess the\nposition of the leiomyoma. A 30 degree telescope is then inserted\nthrough a 10mm umbilical port. The stomach is visualised and a\nsuture is passed through the anterior abdominal wall directly over the\nanterior aspect of the stomach. This suture is then passed through\nthe anterior wall of the stomach and then back through the anterior\nabdominal wall. A second suture is passed in the same way adjacent\nto the first. Traction on these sutures therefore lifts up the anterior\nwall of the stomach. A 10mm port is placed under direct vision in\nthe left upper quadrant. Using cutting diathermy a transverse\nincision is made through the anterior wall of the stomach below the\nsutures. Visualisalion by means of the gastroscope ensures that the\nincision is placed allowing best access to the leiomyoma. The gastnc\nleiomyoma can then be seen and grasped by Johannes laparoscopic\ngraspers. A second port (12mm) is positioned in the right upper\nquadrant. Through this can be placed an endoscopic linear cutter.\nTraction on the laparoscopic graspe pulls the lciomyoma through\nthe transverse incision in the stomach. The linear stapler can then be\nplaced across the stomach beneath the leiomyoma. Sequential\napplications and firings of the linear staple removes the leiomyoma\nand simultaneously closes the stomach. The anterior gastrotomy is\nclosed with a single layer of maxon.\nBianila Eight patients, median age 77 years (range 33-83 years)\nwho have presented with gastric leiomyomas have been treated. No\ndeaths or compication occured. One patient requird conversion to\nan open procedure as the leiomyoma was very large. Following this\nprocedure patients are mobilising and allowed to drink and eat the\nfollowing day. The median length of stay in hospital was 5 days\n(range 4-7 days). The patient requiring the open procedure remained\nfor 8 days. No peri or post operative blood transfusion was\nrequired.\nConclusions This is a safe and effective technique. It allows\nearlier mobilisation than conventional laparotomy.\nLONG-TERM SURVIVAL, SYMrTOMS AND DRUG USE AFTER\nETIC ULCR HAEMORRIIUAGE\nA Flvak, J Masson, L Bucnr, G McKnigt, P Branleyf, WC Smith,\nNAG Mowat.

Lanzini. Medicine 1, Dentistry* and Biochemistry and\nVirology \u00a7. Spedali Civili and University. Brescia. Italy.\nPresence of HP in dental plaque is controversial, a discrepancy\nattributed to differences in methodology. Our aim was to validate and\napply for the first time an immunochemical technique to detect HP in\ndental plaque.\n80 consecutive patients (M:F=44:36, age range 16-87 years)\nundergoing endoscopy were examined for oral hygiene and a sample\nof dental plaque was removed before the procedure. Subjects on\nantibiotics or using antiseptic mouth-washing were excluded. Oral\nhygiene was classified using the Loe and Silness plaque and gingival\nindex. Dental plaque was obtained with a sterile Gracey curette, from\nat least 5 dental elements, suspended in sterile saline, smeared on a\nslide, dried, fixed in ethanol 900 and stored at 4\u00b0C until examination\nAll patients had six biopsies taken from antrus, body and fundus for\nmicroscopic examination and a sample of blood for detection of HP\nantibodies. Plaque smears were tested by indirect immunoperoxidase\ntechnique based on a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies specific\nfor HP ( Negrini R. Gastroenterology 1989;96:414-20); its sensitivity\nand specificity were both 100\"h when tested on plaque samples\nartificially enriched with HP.\n51 patients (64%) were HP infected, as diagnosed by concordant\nhistology and serology. All of them had variable degree of active\nchronic gastritis on microscopy and 15 had peptic ulcer. In none of\nthese infected patients was HP detected in dental plaque. Furthermore\nthe 400 dental plaque samples from the whole study population were\nall HP negative. No relationship was found between oral hygiene\nscores and presence ofHP in the stomach.\nIn conclusion, our results using a highly sensitive method for\ndetection of HP in dental plaque suggest that plaque is not a reservoir\nfor HP infection.\nA8\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl1)\nSmallbowel and pancreas W33-W47\nW33\nA9\nW35\nSMALL INTESTINAL CRYPT HYPERPLASIA IN AFRICAN\nTROPICAL ENTEROPATHY.

'Digestive Diseases Research\nCentre, St Bartholomew's & The Royal London School of Medicine\n& Dentistry, London, 2University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka,\nZambia & Gastroenterology divisions of the Universities of\n3Witwatersrand and 4Pretoria, South Africa.\nIntroductio ad aims: We have previously found evidence of\ntropical enteropathy in the healthy black population of Lusaka,\nZambia, but normal villous architecture in urban black South\nAfricans. In addition, we have demonstated increased mucosal T cell\nactivation in the Zambian population compared to South Africans. In\nthis study we have sought to determine wheth6r, like other T cell-\nmediated enteropathies, tropical enteropathy is associated with crypt\nhyperplasia.\nPatients and methods: 12 black Zambian subjects, 22 black South\nAfricans and 21 white South Africans undergoing routine upper\ngastointestinal endoscopy for dyspepsia (GU, DU, diarrhoea and\nAIDS excluded) were studied. Formalin-fixed parffin-processed\nbiopsies were assessed by computerised image analysis to determine\nvillous height (VH) and crypt depth (CD). Duodenal biopsies, fixed\nin Carnoy's solution and stored in 70%'\/oethanol, were stained by the\nFeulgen reaction. Crypt mitotic counts were determined by direct\ncounting of stained mitotic figures in microdissected crypts.\nResults: Median VH was lower in Zambians [283 (262-389)gm]\nthan black South Africans [412 (235-456)un] or white South\nAfricans [377 (285-530)] p=0.03, but CD was not significantly\ndifferent between the groups. Median mitoses\/crypt was greater in\nZambians [3.7 (1.9-7.9)] than black South Africans [2.4 (0.2-3.7)] or\nwhite South Africans compared [2.1 (1-3.7)] p=0.003.\nConclusions: We have confirmed the presence of tropical\nenteropathy in urban black Zambians, and its absence in urban black\nand white South Africans. Our data suggest that tropical enteropathy\nis associated with crypt hyperlasia, although this was not\naccompanied by an increase in crypt depth.\nW34\nDETECTION OF INTRALUMINAL SEROTONIN (5-HT) IN\nPATIENTS WITH HIV-RELATED DIARRHOEA. Kelly P.\nTurvill JL, Farthing MJG. Digestive Diseases Research Centre, St\nBartholomew's & The Royal London School of Medicine &\nDentistry, London, UK.\nIntroduction: The pathogenesis of HIV-related diarrhoea remains\nunknown and the role of 5-HT as an endogenous secretagogue or\nprokinetic in this condition is unexplored. Enterochromaffin cells,\nwhen activated by enterotoxins, are known to release 5-HT into the\nintestinal lumen, where it can act as a secretagogue. We investigated\nwhether excess 5-HT is released into the small intestinal lumen in\npatients with HIV-related diarrhoea.\nMethods: Duodenal aspirates were obtained at upper\ngastrointestinal endoscopy from an unselected group of 69 HIV\ninfected patients with persistent diarrhoea, and from 8 diarrhoea-free\ncontrol patients being investigated for dyspepsia. Aspirates were\ncollected into protease inhibitors, frozen to -80'C, and 5-HT\nconcentrations determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection.\nResults: 5-HT concentrations were close to the limits of detection\nin all of the control aspirates (0-0.53nmol\/1). 5-HT concentrations\nwere markedly elevated in a sub-group of the patients with HIV\nrelated diarrhoea (range 0-224nmoV1I). Of the patients with HIV\nrelated diarrhoea, 45 (61%) had 5-HT concentrations at control\nlevels, whereas 27 (39%\/o) had markedly elevated concentrations\ncompared to controls (p=0.04 by Fisher's exact test). Aspirate pH\nwas not related to 5-HT concentration and some of the higher values\nwere seen in aspirates with pH>7.0. The group of patients with high\n5-HT concentrations was not defined by enteric infection,\nimmunoglobulin or soluble tumour necrosis factor concentrations in\nserum, immunoglobulin concentration in duodenal aspirate,\nnutritional status or severity of enteropathy.\nConclusion: In a sub-population of patients with HIV-related\ndiarrhoea, intraduodenal concentrations of 5-HT were up to three\norders of magnitude higher than in controls. While the clinical\nrelevance of this observation is as yet unclear, similar concentrations\nhave been detected in jejujnal perfusates of human volunteers with\ncholera toxin-induced secretion. These observations raise the\npossibility that 5-HT may mediate some of the pathophysiological\ndisturbances which underlie this disorder, suggesting novel\napproaches for therapeutic intervention.\nINHIBITION OF CHOLERA TOXIN BUT NOT E.COLI\nENTEROTOXIN-INDUCED SECRETION BY SUBSTANCE P\n(SP) ANTAGONIST.

We investigated whether SP mediates the non-inflammatory\nsecretory state indued by cholera toxin (CT) and Escherichia coli\nheat labile (LT) and heat stable enterotoxins (STa) in vivo.\nMethodLCT and LT experiments: Anaesthetised male Wistar rats(180-220g) were pre-treated with the selective SP antagonist D pro2\nD Trp79SP (PTT-SP) 3.0mg\/kg ip. 20cm small intestinal segments\nwere isolated between cannulae into which 25gg CT or 25gg LT in\n2ml saline was instilled and incubated. After 2h, in situ perfusion\nwas performed with plasma electrolyte solution (Na 140, K 4, Cl\n104, HCO3 40 mmol\/l) containing [I4C]-polyethylene glycol as a\nnon-absorbable marker. After an equilibration period, 3xlOmin\ncollections were made and net fluid and electrolyte movement\ndetermined.\nSTa experiments: After pre-treatment with 3.0mg\/kg PTT-SP, thejejunal segment was perfused with PES containing [\"C]-PEG to\nwhich 200jg\/l STa (equivalent to 50000 mouse units) had been\nadded.\nResults. CT-induced net water secretion (median -94.0pi\/min\/g dw[IQR -106.5 to -63.0]; n=ll1) was significantly reduced by pre-\ntreatment with PTT-SP (-10.4 [-42.5 to -4.1]; n=7, p<0.002). LT-\ninduced a similar degree of sezretion (-67.6 [-89.4 to -33.0]; n=16,\np=0.08 compared to CT control) which, by contrast, was notinhibited by PTT-SP (-50.7 [-67.6 to -35.3]; n=16, p=0.3). In the\nsame way, STa-induced secretion (-65.3 [-83.2 to -54.6], n=6) was\nnot effected by PTT-SP (-77.4 [-81.9 to -76.2]; n=5). Electrolytes\nparalleled water.\nConclusion. The finding that the SP antagonist PTT SP significantly\ninhibits CT but not LT or STa-induced secretion is consistent with\nthe observation that there are fumdamental differences in the way\nthese three enterotoxins activate a secretory reflex arc in the host.\nW36\nPARAOXETINE INHIBITS CHOLERA TOXIN INDUCED\nSECRETION BY DEPLETING NEURONAL BUT NOT\nENTEROCHROMAFFIN (EC) CELL 5-HT. Turvill JL, Farthing\nMJG. Digestive Disea Research Centre, St Bartholomew's & The\nRoyal London School of Medicine, UK.\nIntroduction. Depletion of the secretagogue and neurotransmnitter,5-HT, from the small intestine partially iihibits cholera toxin CT-induced secretion. Since a substantial proportion of this secretion is\nneuronallymediated we postulated that a greater anti-secretory effect\nmay resut from the selective depletion of neuronal 5-HT from the\nsmall intestine. We investigated whether the selective serotonin re-\nuptake inhibitor, paroxetine, would cause neural but not EC celldepletion and whether this would result in the inhibition of CT-induced secretion in vivo.\nMethods. Two groups of male Wistar rats (180-220g) were gavaged\nfor three days with paroxetine 3mg\/kg in 1 ml water or water alone,\nand then anaesthetised. In the first group, the mucosa was gently\nscraped from the deeper small intestinal layers and 5-HT levels weredetermined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection. In the second\ngroup, 25pg CT in 2ml saline was incubated in 20cm small intestinal\nsegments, isolated between cannulae. After 2h, in situ perfusion wasirformed with plasma electrolyte solution (Na 140, K 4, Cl 104,iC03 40mmoI\/l) containing [ 4C]-PEG as a non-absorbable marker,\nto determine and net water and electrolyte movements. Whole brain\nwas then removed for detemination of 5-HT levels as described\nabove.\nResults. Mucosal 5-HT levels (med 81.0pmol\/mg dw [IQR 65.3 to851; n-9) were unaffected by pre-treatment with paroxetine (87.5[74.3 to 112]; n=6, p=0.4 MW). By contrast, brain 5-HT levels(9.4pmol\/mg [8.7 to 10.11; n=8) were significantly reduced byparoxetine 0.9 [0.8 to 1.0]; n=7, p<0.001). In keepimg with these\nfindings, C -induced net water secretion (-101 .2 \u00b1l\/min\/g dw [-146.5\nto -74.9]; n=14) was inhibited by pre-treatment with poxetine (-\n33.2 [-49.5 to -18.6]; n=6, p<0.005). Electrolytes paralleled water.Summary and conclusion. Paroxetine depletes neuronal 5-HT, asdemonstrated by a reduction in brain 5-HT, but not EC cell 5-HTlevels within the small intesn mucosa. We postulate that the\nassociated inhibition of CT-induced secretion results either from (i)\nthe depletion of 5-HT within the myenteric plexus or (ii) thedesensitisation of submucosal nerves, which are unable to re-uptake\nthe 5-HT released from activated EC cells.\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW37 W39\nW38 W40\nISCHAEIA-RE PERFUSION INJURY FOLLOWING\nSYNGENE5IC SMALL DOWEL TRANSPLANTATION INDUCES\nAPOPTOSIS\nKASaL S Shurey, CJ Gren (introduced by AB Price)\nDepatment ofSc Resel, Northwick Park Institute for Medical\nReserh, Northwick Pak Hospital, Harow, Middlesex, HAl 3UJ, UK.\nTwo componets cause graft injury following small bowel\nplantation; the damage induced by cold ischaemic storage and\nexacebation ofthis following reerfusion. Te combined manifestation,\ntermed ic iafusion injury, has been described morphologically\nas causing vilous destucion and crypt loss. Many of these cellular\nchanges have been attibuted to necrosis.\nIn a morphological study on syngmeic small bowel tnplantation in\nLewis rat, grfts werc stored in saline (n=6) or University ofWisconsin\n(UW) solution (n=6) for 24 hours and trnplanted with portal venous\ndrainage. Samples of the graft obtained before harvest, after cold\nischaemic storage and after I hour ofreperfusion were processed for light\n(LM) and electron microscopy (EM) using conventional protocols.\nGrft storage resultd in loss of villous integrity (saline worse than\nUW), but adequate crypt prscvation. Apoptosis ofsome denuded villous\nepithelial cells was noted; there was no increase in crypt cell apoptosis\ncompared to normal.\nAfter one hour of pon, there was extensive villous destruction.\nVariable crypt loss was observed, with saline stored grafts showing more\ndamae than UW stored ones. 'Te preserved crypts showed karyorrhectic\ndebris and chromatin magnton on LM suggestive of apoptosis, which\nwas confirmed on EM. Some crypt cells exhibited condensation with\nnuclear and cytoplasmic features of \"dark cells\". A minor increase in\nacute inflammatory cells was noted in the lamina propria. Only an\noccasional crypt cell showed ultrastructural features ofnecrosis.\nThis study has identified apoptosis as a prominent mode of cell death\nfollowing ischaemia-reperfsion injury in transplanted small bowel. This\nhas possible implications on general intestinal ischaemic injury and on the\ndevelopment of specific therapeutic interventions.\nATYPICAL PRESENTATION OF COELIAC DISEASE: A\nRETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF ONE INSTITUTION'S\nEXPERIENCE\nRMSMitSchel, TJ Robinson. Dept. ofMedicine, Craigavon Area\nHospital, Northem Ireland\nIt is known that only a minority ofpaties with coehac disease\npresen casically with diarhoea, steatorrhoea and features of\nmalabsorption; features at presentation are more likely to be red cell\nabnormalties such as per macrocytosis or inreased red cell\ndistribution width, weit loss or conctirrt e diseases. In\nour population the prevalence of coeliac diease is high apd often\npresents atypically.\nClinical and laboratory data were collected from 127 consecutive\npatients diagosed histologically with gluten sensitive enteropathy\nwith special reference to the ages at which the patients first\ndeveloped significant manifestations of the disease, when the disease\nwas diagnosed and the cause ofthe delay.\n70 (50 female) of the 127 patients hada s c delayindiagnosis. Mean age at diagnosis ofthose diagnosed at initial\npresentation was 43.6 years (males 45.1, females 42.9); mean age in\nthose whose diagnosis was delayed was ignifibhighe at 48.5\nyears (males 48.9, females 48.4, p<0.03); in this group the mean\ndelay was 107.3 months (range 6-480). In 44 patients (33 female)\nred cell abnormalities only were present; 15 patients had an isolated\npersistent macrocytosis which resolved on gluten-free diet. 17\npatients (9 female) had gastrointestnl symptoms ofmalabsorptionbut presented late. 2 patients presented with a concurrent associated\ndisease and 5\/50 female patients only had symptoms during\npregnancy.\nIn conclusion, the majority of our patients did not present\nclassically, therefore a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose\nthese patients, especially in patients with refractory red cell\nabnormalities in populations where the condition has a high\nprevalence.\nINTESTINAL PERMEABILITY AND ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY\nIN PATENTS RECEIVING PARENTERAL NUTRITION. WS\nWassif, R Crane, H Thadani, L Thompson, C Wicks, WJ\nMarshall, I Bjamason. Department of Clinical Biochemistry,\nKing's College School of Medicine & Dentistry, London\nBackground: It has been suggested that there is a dual\nsupply for enterocyte nutrition, namely luminal during absorption\nand blood bome durng fasting. In rats parenteral nutrition leads\nto aiterations in motility and villus atrophy, but the effect of\nfasting and parenteral nutrition in man is largely unknown. Aim:\nTo assess small intestinal permneability and absorptive capacity\nin patients requiring parenteral nutrition following prolonged\nfasting and responses to re-feeding. Mto: Weekly\nassessments of intestinal permeability (lactulose\/L-rhamnose)\nand absorptive capacity (3-0-m-D-glucose, D-xylose, L-\nrhamnose) were made in 9 patients requiring parenteral\nnutritional support (for 15 median, range 8-29 days). Results:\nSix of seven patients having been nil by mouth for at least a\nweek had signfianty (p<0.01) increased intestinal permeability(differential urinary excretion of lactuiose\/L-rhamnose\n0.18\u00b10.13) as compared with heafthy controls (0.03\u00b10.02) and\nthe two who had some oral intake (0.03\u00b10.01). Furthermore\nabsorptive capacity was significantly (p<0.05) impaired in the\nfasting patients (3-0-m-D-glucose 26.5\u00b119.5%, D-xylose14.2\u00b112.2%\/o, L-rhamnose 3.7\u00b12.8%) as compared with controls(44.6\u00b17.7%, 30.7\u00b17.3% and 10.5\u00b12.5%, respectively). There\nwas a further deterioration in intestinal perenabUity and\nabsorptive capacity in patients on total parenteral nutrition\nwithout oral intake, but not in those concomitantly receiving oral\nsupplementation (500-800 kcal\/24 hours). Within a week of re-\nestablishing oral intake intestinal permeability retumed towards\nthe reference range (0.066\u00b10.02) and absorptive capacity was\nrestored (3-0-m-D-glucose 48.1\u00b121.3%, D-xylose 26.9\u00b111.5%,\nL-rhamnose 8.5\u00b13.9%). Conclusions: Blood bome nutritionduring total fasting is insufficient to maintain gastrointestinalintegrity in man which may have implications for microbial\ntranslocation and endotoxaemia. As small amounts of food\nprevent this deterioration every effort should be made to\nmaintain some enteral intake in these patients.\nPresentation and Incidence ofCola Disease nSouth Glamog.Hawkes ND,Swift G.L, Davies A ,Rhodes J,Smith P.M,Jenkins H.(Departments ofChild Health & Gastroenterology, University Hospital ofWales, & Department of Gastroenterology, Llandough Hospital, Cardiff )\nAinm 1) To assess the number ofnew cases of Coeliac Disease (CD) and\nDermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) and the symptoms at presentation in both\nadults and children between 1\" January 1991 and 31\" December 1995 for\nthe resident population of South Glamorgan. 2) To compare incidence rates\nwith comparative data for the period 1981-1990.\nMethod& All children (aged <14 years ) and adults with CD or DH\ndiagnosed during the study period were identified from hospital activity\nanalysis data, pathology and dietetic records, letters circulated to local\nGeneral Practitioners and through the local Coeliac Society. All had\nhistologically proven disease and fufilled the fully revised ESPGAN criteria.\nThe Registrar General's mid year estimates for the population of South\nGlamorgan were then used to calculate incidences.\nReuaL A total of 59 new cases ofCD were identified (9 children,50\nadults) and 5 cases of DH(all adults). In the children (4 boys,5 girls) the\nmean age at diagnosis was 7.6 years (range 1. 7- 14.9). 77% presented with\nabdominal symptoms (with anaemia 57%), none with anaemia alone. Two\nchildren presented with failure to thrive and two cases were identified\nthrough family screening. In the adults with CD there was a significant\ndifrence in the sex ratio (13 males,37 females) [p<0.05J with a mean age\nat diagnosis of 50.0 years (range 26.0-88.2, no difference between males\nand females). 80%\/o presented with abdominal symptoms (with anaemia\n48%), 20\/o with anaemia alone.

Tsai.\nGastroenterology Department, Castle Hill Hospital, Castle Road,\nCottingham, E. Yorkshire. U.K. HU16 5JQ.\nThe association between ulceraive colitis and non-smoking is\nwell known. Coeliac disease is an allergic mucosal disease\nwhich also have an inflammatory component and is associated\nwith inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated patients with\ncoeliac disease to see if they share the same epidemiological\ncharacteristic.\nMethods: A total of 330 patients with a definitive diagnosis of\ncoeliac disease were prospectively interviewed by a sandardised\nquestionnaire. 114 controls were recruited from accident and\nemergency department and were matched for age and sex.\nResults: 37 out of 330 (11.2%) patients with coeliac disease\nwere smokers compared to 48 out of 114 (42%) control patients.\nThis is a significant finding (P< 0.0001; OR:0.174 95% CI\n0.105-0.288). There were 90 (27.3%) ex-smokers amongst the\ncoeliac group compared to 3 (2.6%) in the control group. This is\nalso a highly significant finding (P<0.0001; OR:13.88 95% CI\n4.30-44.80). 16 of the patients who were ex-smokers stopped\nsmoking after diagnosis of coeliac disease. Exclusion of these\npatients from the analysis, patients with coeliac disease were\nstill more likely to be ex-smokers compared to controls\n(P<0.0001; OR 10.70,95% CI 3.30-34.65).\nConclusion: Coeliac disease, like ulcerative colitis is\nassociated with non-smoking, although the relative risk is lower\nthan that quoted for ulcerative colitis. The strikingly large\nnumber of ex-smokers amongst coeliac patients is not due to\nincreased medical contact. These findings are unexplained and\ndeserve further study.\nINSULIN INDEPENDENCE FOLLOWING COMBINED TOTAL\nPANCREATECTOMY AND ISLET AUTOTRANSPLANTATION\nSAWhitc.

Recent evidence-based national guidelines for the\nmanagement of AP have been proposed by the British Society of\nGastroenterology. Aim:To compare the results of our audit with the\nproposed audit goals. Methods: All patients were seen within 24 hrs of\nadmission and APACHE-II scored. Follow-up data was subsequently\nobtained through review of the notes after discharge. Results: 186\npatients were admitted with AP: 80 women, 106 men.

We reviewed our District\nGeneral Hospital (DGH) experience over 6 years of 50 consecutive\npatients (32 males) aged 31-84 yrs(mean 62) undergoing pancreatic\nsurgery. The indications for surgery were pancreatic cancer 25(50%\/), acute pancreatitis and its complications 16 (32%), chronic\npancreatitis 6 (12%) and others 3 (6%). The procedures performed\nincluded; Whipples 12 (24%), Triple bypass 12 (24%), sub-total\npancreatectomy I l(including 3 with cyst drainage) (22%), pylorus\npreserving pancreatico-duodenectomy 5 (10%\/), total pancreatectomy\n3 (6%), palliative choledocho-jejunostomy 4 (8%) and necrosectomy\n3 (6%).\nThirty-day mortality was 60\/. Complications included 8 patients\nwith respiratory (2) or cardiac failure (!), pleural effusions (3),\narterial bleeding (1) or a bile leak (I); two required re-opaation.\nMedian length of hospital stay was 15 days (range 8-77). Median\nsurvival for the 27 patients with malignant disease was 8 months\n(range I to 23 months). The 23 patients with benign disease have\nbeen followed for a median of 3 years; 3 have died, one from\nrecurrent acute pancreatitis and two others from unrelated causes. Of\nthe 20 surviving,4 have developed pancreatic insufficiency and a\nfurther 2 have recurrent pain.\nWe conclude that successful pancreatic surgery can be performTed\nsafely in a DGH setting.

University Surgical Unit, Southanpton General\nHospital, Southampton.\nThe complications and early deaths associated with acute\npancreatitis appear to involve inappropriate immune system\nactivation. PAF is a central mediator of this response. Our aim\nwas to investigate the effect of lexipafant, a potent PAF antagonist,\nin a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in patients\npredicted to develop complications.\nPatients with acute pancreatitis and APACHE II score>6 were\nrandomised within 72hrs of onset of symptoms to receive an\ninfusion of lexipafant (100mg\/day for 7 days) (n=139) or identical\nplacebo (n=151). Seven patients who died were excluded (wrong\ndiagnosis,n=3; unrelated cause of death,n=3; protocol violation\n(cancer of pancreas),n=l). Overall and attributable mortalities were\nnot significantly less after lexipafant (n=18, 12%) and (n=14, 9\u00b0\/o)\nthan after placebo (n=24, 17%) and (n-21, 15%); (0.l<p<0.2).\nHowever, 11 (10%) of 107 patients treated within 48hrs of onset\ndied, significantly less than 20 (20%) of 98 given placebo within\n48hrs (p=0.04). Attributable mortality in these patients was\nsignificantly less with active treatment (8 of 104, 8%) than placebo\n(17 of 95. 18%); (p=0.03). Median change in organ failure score on\nday 3 was significantly different in the two groups (lexipafant -I (-1\nto 0), placebo 0 (-I to 0); p=0.04) and there were fewer local\ncomplications in the lexipafant group (30\/148, 20%\/ vs 41\/138,\n30%; p=0.065).\nLexipafant appears to reduce complications and death in patients\npredicted to have severe pancreatitis. This effect is most marked in\npatients treated within 48 hrs of onset of symptoms, consistent with\nthe supposed mode of action of the drug.\nONDANSETRON IN THE TREATMENT OF THE IPRURPIUS\nOF CHOLESTASIS: ARANDOMLSED CONTROLLEDTRIAL\nJ.W.OQetlua C.

The Liver Unit, Queensland\nInstitute of Medical Research, Brisbane, 4029, Australia.\nHaemochromatosis (Hr') is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism\nwhich can cause hepatic cirrhosis. The prevalence in most Caucasian\npopulations studied is approximately 1 in 300 though the disorder\nremains under diagnosed. One reason for such under diagnosis may be\nthat liver function tests (LFT) are often normal. The significance of\nabnormal LFT in HC has not previously been studied.\n50 HC patients were analysed with respect to abnormalities ol\ntransaminases at diagnosis, age, sex, transferrin saturation, serum\nferritin, hepatic iron concentration (HIC), Scheuer grade of fibrosis\nand the presence of other histological hepatic features.\n56% had normal LEJT at diagnosis compared to 44% with abnorma\nLFT. lTere were no significant differences between thb two groups in\nterms of age, transferrin satraton or HIC. The group with abnormal\nLFT however had significantly higher senrm ferritin levels (1812\u00b1986\nvs 669\u00b1407, p<O.000l) and a greater male prepondernce (p<0.05).\n29% of patients with normal LFI had no histological abnormalities\nother than increased iron stores. 35% of rmtients with nornal LFT had\nhepatic fibrosis without histological inflammation, steatosis or oter\nhistological abnormalities. All patients with abnormal LFI had\nhistological abnormalities other than increased hepatic iron stores.\nPatients with abnormal LFT were more likely to have fibrosis than\nthose with normal LFT (82% vs 54%, p<0.05) and to have a more\nsevere grade of fibrosis (1.9\u00b11.4 vs 0.8\u00b10.8, p<0.001).\nLiver dan;. t' can develop in HC due to increaced iron stores alone\nand in the presence of nornal LFI. However, HC patients with\nabnormal LFT are more likely to have fibrosis and at a more advanced\nstage. Therefore, although abnormal LFT indicate the presence of\nhepatic complications in haemochromatosis, normal LFT do nol\npreclude the presence of hepatic damage. Recently the HC gene has\nbeen cloned and a genetic diagnostic test may soon be available.\nHowever, in general liver biopsy is still indicated in haemochromatosis\nfor diagnosis and assessment of hepatic complications.\nFINDINGS ON LIVER BIOPSY FOR ABNORMAL LIVER\nFUNCTION TESTS IN THE POST HEPATITIS C TESTING ERA.\nG Vautier, P James and S Ryder. Departments of\nGastroenterology and Pathology, Queen's Medical Centre,\nNottingham, NG7 2UH.\nBackground. Abnormal liver function tests are relatively\ncommon but their significance In the presence of negative\nserological tests is uncertain.\nMethods. We have prospectively studied 210 consecutive\npatients aged 18 to 78 undergoing investigation for abnormal\nliver function tests, defined as persistent elevation of ALT or GGT\nover 6 months, in whom serology for hepatitis B and C,\nautoantibodies, serum ferritin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, copper studies\n(where appropriate), and ultrasound scanning were\nnormaVnegative. Alcohol histories were taken from patients and\ncorroborating relatives and if consumption >4g per day patients\nwere excluded.\nResults. 8 patients refused liver biopsy. 9\/202 (4.5%) were\ncirrhotic on biopsy and a further 19 (9.4%) had increased fibrosis.\nFinal diagnoses were Non-Alcoholic steatohepatitis 68 [34%],\nfatty liver without inflammation 74 (37%], alcohol related liver\ndisease 6 [3%], autoimmune hepatitis (steroid responsive) 4 [2%],\ndrug induced 31 [15%], primary biliary cirrhosis 1 [0.5%],\nhaemochromatosis 2 [1%], amyloidosis 1 [0.5%] and normal liver\n15 [7.5%]. Complications of liver biopsy (non U\/S guided,\nmenghini needle) were 4 patients with post biopsy pain and one\nwith a bile leak requiring 6 days hospitalisation. No patients\nsuffered haemorrhage.\nConclusions. Liver biopsy for abnormal liver function tests\nproduces a diagnosis of potentially progressive liver disease in\n55%. 13% of patients had significant fibrosis or cirrhosis at the\ntime of biopsy. Clinical management was altered in 43 patients\n(21 %) and only one significant complication of liver biopsy was\nseen. Patients with persistent abnormalities of their liver function\ntests should be offered liver biopsy.\nTHE EFFECT OF HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY ON\nSERUM AND URINARY MARKERS OF BONE TURNOVER IN\nPRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS. SP Pereira', J O'Donohue', C\nMoniz2, C Mackintosh2, H Abraha2, M Buxton-Thomas3, Roger Williams'.\n'Institute of Liver Studies, and Depts. of 2Clinical Biochemistry and\n3Nuclear Medicine, King's College Hospital, Londor SE5 9RS.\nEvidence from retrospective studies suggests that hormone replacement\ntherapy (HRT) is well-tolerated and may be helpful in retarding the rate of\nbone loss in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). However, there have been no\nprospective studies in PBC of the effect ofHRT on bone mineral density or\nserum and urinary markers of bone turnover. Methods: 42 post-\nmenopausal women with PBC (median age 57 yr, range 52-63 yr) were\ntreated with calcium+vitamin D, either alone (n=22) or together with\ntopical HRT (n=20; Estracombi, Ciba). Bone densitometry (Lunar) of the\nfemoral neck and L2-L4 vertebrae was performed at baseline, and serum\nand urinary markers of bone turnover measured at three-monthly intervals.\nWe report here our baseline and three-month findings. Results: The two\ngroups were well-matched for age, year of menopause (49 yr, 43-51 yr),\nhistological stage, serum bilirubin level (median 15 pM, range 4-65 PM)\nand bone densitometry scores. In the 42 patients, spinal or femoral\nosteopaenia (T score -1 to -2.5) was present in 16 (38%\/9), while 7 othrs\n(l7\/o) had established osteoporosis (T < -2.5). Baseline serum osteocalcin\nand adjusted calcium concentrations were 7.0 og\/i (4.2-14.9 jgO) and 2.4\nmM (2.2-2.6 mM), respectively, which did not change significantly at three\nmonths in either group. In the controls, urinary calcium and creatinine\nlevels, and urinary deoxypyridinoline:creatinine ratios, were sim;ilar at\nbaseline and three months. In contrast, urinary calcium concentrations fell\nsignificantly in the HRT group, from 2.5 mM to 1.2 mM (p<0.05). Overall,\nHRT was well-tolerated, with no increase in cholestasis and only one\nwithdrawal due to minor side-effects. Conclusions: The initial results of\nthis prospective study confirm that osteoporosis is common in post-\nmenopausal women with PBC, and that topical HRT is well-tolerated.\nCompared with calcium+vitamin D alone, supplemental HRT is associated\nwith decreased urinary calcium excretion - a sensitive marker of bone\ntumover.\nA13\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW53\nW54\nW55\nW56\nIgG, gM, IgA BHAT SHOCK PROTEIN ANTIBODIES\nIN IMAY BIIARY ROSE-\nEmCr OF UDCA ThERAPY\nAVjrm T Davis, MA Asante HA Ahmed, IP Jazawi,\nJD Maxwerl, TC Northfidd\nDiviion ofMedicine, St Geore's Hop aMdiaiSckov4 London\nPrimary biliay cirrho.s (PBC) is an at e disese wh reuts\nin destuction of intahepaic bie ductudes Epiopes dshrd by en\ninfectous gagt end the host have been proposed as a poible flak\nbetwen inton and autoinunuity.

After April 1987\nall cases seen were offered treatment with ursodeoxy-\ncholic acid (UDCA) 750 mg daily. The 37 treated with\nUDCA were followed up at 1,2,4,6,9, a 12 months and\nthen 6 monthly. Results were compared with historical\nlocal controls and published data in other series.\nThere was a uniform early improvement in abnormal\n\"liver function\" tests, maximal at 4 months. There was\nan early improvement in histology in 3 out of 8\nrebiopsied at 4 months. Twenty-eight patients reported\nimprovement or cure in symptoms, 7 had no change, and\nin 2 patients there was a prompt exacerbation which led\nto immediate cessation of treatment.\nOverall survival was significantly improved, though it\nwas still less than the general population and the effect\nwas only seen after 2 years' treatment. Histological\nstage I disease, lower age and lower initial bilirubin,\nand to a lesser extent serum IgG and haemoglobin levels\npredicted better survival. In stage I disease median\nfollow- up was 4 years. Survival was normal in the 14\nallocated to UDCA, and 1 case followed for 7 years lost\nall clinical evidence of disease and may have been cured.\nIn stage II to IV disease median follow-up was 2\u00bd years:\nin the 23 allocated to UDCA there was a sustained trend\nto improved survival (37% v. 28% at 7 years, Kaplan-\nMeier analysis). Most deaths related to liver disease\nand by chance none of the patients has proceeded to liver\ntransplant, so these are true absolute life tables.\nCONCLUSION - UDCA is effective and easy to use,\navofids theined for more toxic drugs in PBC, and should\nbe offered to all cases not imminently expecting\ntransplant. There may be a case for treating\npre-symptomatic disease.\nNITRIC OXIDE RELEASE IN THE SPLANCHNIC CIRCULATION\nOF CIRRHOTIC RATS\nAI Sarela & RT Mathie (Introduced by RCN Williamson). Department\nof Surgery, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith\nHospital, London W12 ONN.\nEnhanced splanchnic vascular nitric oxide (NO) activity has been\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension associated with\ncirrhosis of the liver. However, the portal venous concentration of total\nnitrite and nitrate (nitric oxide metabolites, NOx), which is established\nas a reliable indicator ofNO production, has not been previously\nstudied.\nExperimental micro-nodular cirrhosis was induced in adult male\nWistar rats by the administration of phenobarbitone and carbon\ntetrachloride (n=7). Age- and weight-matched rats (n=5) and\nphenobarbitone treated rats (n=5) served as controls. We assayed portal\nvenous concentrations ofNOx and total biochemical activity of nitric\noxide synthase (NOS) in the liver and mesentery ofboth groups.\nCirrhotic rats had significantly higher mean portal pressure than\ncontrols (1 1.00 (S.E.M. 1.22) vs. 4.80 (0.96) mmHg; P=O.002[ Portal\nvenous concentrations ofNOx were significantly lower in cirrhosis than\nin controls (75.33 (16.54) vs. 128.34 (15.66) ismol.r'; P'=0.02) There\nwas a significant negative correlation between portal pressure and portal\nvenous NOx concentrations Ir=-0.57; P-0.041. Total NOS activity in\nthe mesentery was higher in cirrhosis than controls 16.17 (1.19) vs. 3.30\n(0.68) pmol.g'.min-'; P=0.04). In contrast, hepatic total NOS activity\nwas similar in both groups (1 1.79 (2.14) vs. 10.06 (1.42) pmol.g'.min1';\nP=0.60).\nThese results imply that total NO release in the portal venous\ndrainage territory of cirrhotic rats is decreased, although mesenteric\nNOS activity is enhanced. We speculate that NO release in the\nsplanchnic viscera may be downregulated in response to the overactivity\nof another putative vasodilator which is NO-independent. The inverse\nrelationship between portal pressure and portal venous NOx\nconcentration would support this hypothesis.\nA14\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW57\nW58\nW59\nW60\nEFECT OF TEPSS ON RENAL BLOOD FLOW IN\nCIRRHOTIC PATIENTS.\nAJIii_ek DNRedad*, IADBoucer, PCHayes.\nDepts. Medicine and Radiology*, Royal Infirmary ofEdburgh, UK.\nIt has been suggested that an acute increase in portal presu can\ncause an im iae reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) via an\nhepato-renal reflex. In addition, trnsugular in c\nportosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) can improve renal function by\nmechanisms that remain unclear. We used TEPSS placement as a\nmodel to investigate the effect of an acute reduction in portal\npressure on RBF and other haemodynic paramers.\nMethods: 10 cirrhotic patients (8 alcohol related; 6 male; mean\nage 59.5(4.6) yrs; mean CPS 8.3(1.1)) were studied dwing elective\nTIPSS procedure (8 for variceal haemofrhage, 2 for refractory\nascites). Unilateral RBF (thermodilution method) was measured prior\nto and at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after shunt placement. Right\nheart catheterization was undertaken prior to and 30 minutes\nfollowing shunt placement to measure cardiac output (CO), systemic\nvascular resistance (SVR) and mean pulmonary artery preure\n(PAP). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and right\natrial pressure (RAP) were also measured at these times.\nResults: See table. No change was observed in RBF at any time\npoint after TIPSS. Porto-atrial pressure gradient fell by a mean of\n16.7(1.6)mmHg (p<0.001). RAP rose from 2.0(1.2) to\nv.4(1.2) (p<0.001), t no ch was seen in HR or MAP.\nRBF CO SVR PAP\n(ml\/min) (1\/min) (DS\/cm) mmH\npre-TIPSS 252.1(66.8) 5.8(1.0) 1313.5(111.8) 13.1(2.1)\n+ 30 mins 277.2(69.0) 7.5(1.1) 932.8(111.6) 25.2(2.0)\np value NS p<0.005 p<0.005 <0.001\nCondusion: There is no acute increase in RBF in response to the\nacute drop in portal pressure caused by TIPSS.

Institute of\nHepatology', University College London Medical School, London;\nDepts of Child Health, King's College Hospital2, London\nAutoantibodies have a central role in the diagnosis and classification\nof autoimmune liver diseases (AIID). LC1 antibody (LCI-ab), a\nsecond marker of a severe form of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), is often\nassociated with LKM-1 and is detected by immunofluorescence (IFL),\ndouble dimension immunodiffusion (DDI) and Western blotting (Wb).\nUltracentrifugation and immunofluorescence studies show the LC1\nantigen to be present in the cytosol of periportal hepatocytes, its\nmolecularnature remaining unknown. To investigate the target of LC1-\nab, we have used two LCl-ab +ve sera (one ANA and one LKM-l+ve)\nto screen a panel of 18 periportal enzymes by DDI. These enzymes,\nwith a median degree of homology with the human counterpart of 78%,\nincluded: lactic dehydrogenase, arginase, argiinosuccinate lyase\n(ASL), beta-glucuronidase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, fructose-\n1,6-diphosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconic\ndehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase, hexokinase, cytochrome\noxidase, aspartateamino transferase, alanineamino transferase,\nadenosine-5-triphosphatase, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase,\nglutathione peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Both sera recognised\nASL, a cytosolic enzyme involved in the urea cycle and gave a line of\ncomplete identity between themselves. ASL and LC1 antibodies were\ntested in 120 patients, age range 1-77 years (median 20), 74 with AIID\n(25 AIH type I, 32 AIH type II, 17 PBC), 15 chronic HBV infection,\n13 aI anti-trypsin deficiency, 18 extraepatic autoimmune disorders (16\nconnective tissue disease, I autoimmune thyroiditis, I autoimmune\nhaemolytic anaemia) and 24 healthy controls, age range 5-20 years\n(median 15). Thirteen were positive for ASL: 2 AIH type I (8%), 7\nAIH type 11 (22%) and 4 PBC (23%). All other patients and healthy\ncontrols were negative. There was no correlation between ASL and\nLCI positivity.\nAll Wi\"nOf I I21-ahb. l ASl\n-ab+ve I I CIandAST -ahbve74 1 15(20%) 1 13 (17%) 1 4 (5%)\nUnder high resolution DDI conditions (0.8% Agarose and 3% PEG),\nusing the two LCI-ab reference sera and testing simultaneously each\nserum against ASL and LC 1 substrates, two lines were formed against\nLC I, one of which was of partial identity and the other of non identity\nwith ASL. In conclusion a new autoantigen -ASL- is present in AILD.\nThe molecularnature of LC I remains still to be defined.\nA PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF SPEEDBAND VERSUS STEIGMANN-\nGOFF IN ENDOSCOPIC LIGATION OF OESOPHAGEAL VARICES.\nT. Wong. S. Pereira, A. McNair, P. Harrison. Institute of Liver Studies,\nKing's College Hospital, London SE5 9RS.\nEndoscopic ligation is the treatment of choice for oesophageal variceal\nobliteration; however the use of an overtube leads to significant morbidity\nand mortality. Recent advances in endoscopic technology have led to\ndevelopment of multiple banding devices that do not require the application\nof an overtube. In the present study we prospectively examined the safety\nand efficacy of one such device: Speedband against the conventional\nStiegmann-Goff (Bard) ligator.\nPatients and Methods. We prospectively studied 99 variceal banding\nsessions in 45 patients. Speedband ligation was performed in 60 sessions,\nand Bard in 39 sessions. Parameters examined included sedation dosage,\npatient discomfort (mild, moderate, or severe), upper oesophageal damage,\nimmediate band slippage, total time of banding session, total time required\nfor band application (first to last band), and average time of application per\nband. Variceal ligation sessions were randomly assigned to one of the 4\nendoscopists experienced in both methods of band application, and the\nOlympus Q200 endoscope was used for all procedures.\nResults. Patients were well matched at time of endoscopy with respect to\nnumber of varices (mean 3.3 vs 3.4), grade of varices (1.8 vs 1.7), age (49\nyrs vs 50.4 yrs), number of bands applied (4.0 vs 3.4), and Child's-Pugh\nscore (64% vs 68% Child's-Pugh A), Speedband vs Bard respectively. The\nuse of Speedband was associated with a significant reduction in midazolam\n(7.3 mg vs 9.2 mg, p=0.03), and pethidine (10.4 mg vs 24.3 mg p=0.01)\nrequirements. Patients undergoing Speedband application experienced less\ndiscomfort (90% vs 66% mild discomfort, p<0.001), and less upper\noesophageal damage (76% no damage vs 55%, p<0.01). One patient\nundergoing Bard ligation died due to an oesophageal rupture from the\novertube, and in a further 2 cases ligation was abandoned due to\noesophageal haemorrhage; no such complications occurred in the\nSpeedband group. The total time of the endoscopic session was reduced in\nthe Speedband group (7 min 58 secs vs 1 Imin 33 sec, p<0.001), as was the\ntime required for band application (2 min 52 secs vs 5 min 9 secs,\np<O.00 I), and average time taken per band application (46 secs vs 1 min 32\nsecs, p<0. 01). There were no differences between the groups with respect\nto immediate band slippage (18% vs 33%, p=0.09).\nConclusions Speedband ligation is safer, quicker, and associated with less\npatient discomfort and morbidity when compared with Bard ligation. On\nthe basis of this data, a multiple banding device is the method of choice for\nendoscopic variceal ligation.\nDetection of anti conformational CYP2D6 antibodies in patients with\nautoimmune liver disease and HCV infection using a novel radioligand\nassay\nMa YV, GAken P, Bianchi F4, Mieli-Vergani G2, Vergani DV. Institute\nof HepatoloyI University College London Medical School, London;\nDepts of Child Health, Molecular Medicine3, King's College\nHospital, London, UK and Semeiotica Medica4, University of\nBologna, Italy\nLKM-1 antibody is thedi c marker ofautoimmune hepatitis(AE) type 2 and is also found in a proportion of padents with\nhepatits C virus (HCV) infection. Cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6)\nis a major target antigen of LKM-1 in AIH, since the majority of\nLKM-l positive AIH sera recognise the prokaryoticall expressed\ncytochrome. In contrast, only a nmnority ofLKM-1\/anti-HCV positive\nsera do so. In order to investigate the target of LKM-1 in HCV\ninfection, we have established a highly sensitive and specific\nradioligand assay using eukariotically expressed CYP2D6 as target. A\n1.2 kb human CYP2D6 cDNA was isolated from a human liver cDNA\nlibrary and subcloned into an in vitro transcription vector pSP64\nPoly(A). Recombinant CYP2D6 protein was then produced using an\nin vitro transcription\/translation and metabolically labelled with IS\nmethionine. This served as target in the immunoprecipitation assay.\nAntibodies that bound radiolabelled CYP2D6 were\nimmunoprecipitated USing protien A-Sepharose beads and their levels\nassessed as cpm in a liquid scintillation analyzr. A total of 53 LKM-l\npositive sera from 22 children with AIH (median age 10, range 1 to\n20 yrs) and 31 adults with HCV infection (mian age 49 range 16\nto 71 yrs) were tested. One hundred and twent five - negative\nsera iTom 101 age matched children with liver disease (9 XCV\ninfection, 23 HBV infection, 19 AIH tye 1, 18 autoimmune\nsclerosing cholangitis, 19 al-antitrypsin deficiency and 13 Wilson's\ndisease) and 24 adults with systemic lupus erythematosus and sera\nfrom 37 healthy children and 20 adults were also tested. Amongst\nLKM-1 positive sera, reactivity to 3IS labelled CYP2D6 was observed\nin all sera from AIH and in 26 (84%) from HCV infection. The cpm\nin both conditions were significantly higher than in normal controls(P< 0.0001), and were correlated with the immunofluorescence titres\nof LKM-1 in AIH (r=0. 84!, P<0.001) but not in HCV infection(r=0.26). No reactvity to S labelled CYP2D6 was observed in\npatients negadve for LKM-1 and in normal controls. In conclusion: a)\nCYP2D6 is a major target antigen in both AIH and HCV infection but\nthe antibody. affinty is different; b) the novel radioligand assay is\nhighly sensitive anr specific.\nA15\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW61\nW62\nW63\nW64\nTHE IMPACT OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS C INFECTION ON MV\nDISEASE AND lPROGRESSION IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG\nABUSERS.

Brescia.\nIy.\nLong-term IFN adminisetation combined with a dose tapering srategy has\nbeen reported to be the most effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C\n(Hepatology 1995; 22: 700-6). Based on a dose tapering strategy, we have\npreviously reported an IFN sparing effect of adjuvant t-UDCA administration\n(Hepatology 1996; 24; 403A) as judged on serum transaminases, but the\neffect on liver histology was not assessed.\nThe aim pfthe present study was to assess the effect on liver histology of a\nstrtegy combiing t-UDCA adjuvant therapy with 6 months full dose IFN\nfollowed by further 6 months IFN dose tapering.\n121 patients wit chronic hepatitis C have been randomised to receive\neither lymphoblastoid IFN alone (3 MU\/m2\/t.i.w. (regimen A) or IFN + t-\nUDCA (10 mg\/kg\/day) (regimen B) for 6 months, followed by further 6\nmonths IFN dose tapeing for reponders (ALT < 1.5 upper limit of normal).\nControl liver biopsies were carried out 6 months after stopping IFN, while t-\nUDCA was ma ned for regimen B. Disease grading and staging was\nasse by eshak score system ( J Hepatol 1995; 22: 696-9).\n68 patients have been preently followed up for 18 months, and the\nproportion of responders was similar for regimens A and B (19\/32 and 21\/36\nrespectively, NS). 43 patients have had repeat biopsy at 18 months.\nHistological grding decreased from 7.5 + 0.8 pretrtment to 5 + 0.9 during\nregimen A (n = 22, p<0.03) ad fim 7.3 + 0.8 to 4.9+ 0.8durengrgimen\nB (n = 21, p<0.03).

As chronic liver\ndisease progresses, there is an imbalance between\nsynthesis and breakdown of extraceliular matrix (ECM).\nTissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaise-l(TIMP-l) is one of\na group of enzymes which inhibits metalloproteinases\nand are involved in the breakdown of ECM. We have\nmeasured TIMP-i activity in patients with chronic\nhepatitis C and compared this with liver histology.\nMETHODS: Plasma TIMP-1 levels were measured using a\nspecfiic sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham UK)\nin 10 patients with mild chronic hepatitis, 9 patients with\nsevere chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and 14 contrbls with\nnormal liver function tests. Liver biopsies on the\npatients with hepatitis C were scored for a histological\nactivity index by an independent observer, blind to\nclinical details or TIMP-1 results.\nRESULTS: Plasma TIMP-l levels in patients with severe\nliver disease (846.5 ng\/ml + 351.2) and with mild liver\ndisease (533.1 ng\/mi + 313.6), were elevated compared to\ncontrols (187.1 ng\/ml + 62.2), p<0.05. TIMP-1 levels in\npatients with severe liver disease were significantly\nhigher than in those with mild liver diase, p<0.05.\n(mean + S.D.)\nCONCLDSION: Plasma TIMP-1 levels increase with severity\nof liver disease in chronic hepatitis C. The data suggest\nthat plasma TIMP-1 measurements maybe used as a\nnon-invasive indicator of disease activity in chronic\nhepatitis C.\nA16\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW67\nW68W66\nOUTCOME OF ORTHOTOPIC LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN\nHAEMOPHILIA\niHGordoi, PK Mistry', CA Saj2 and CA Lee3 (introduced by JS\nDooley).

Six patients (24%) were HIV\npositive pre-OLT; one had suffered an AIDS-defining illness. Post-OLT,\nthe mean time to nonnal clotting factor levels was 18 hours (range 0-48\nhours) and exogenous clotting factors were sped at a mean of49 hours\n(range 0-480 hours). Four patients had bleeding complications despite\nnonnal clotting values. The 1 and 3 year survival of 6 HIV positive\nrecipients (67% and 23%) was significantly less (p=0.0003 each time-\npoint) than that of 19 HIV negative recipients (90%!. and 83%); 2 of the 5\nHIV positive deaths were due to HIV-unrelated causes. Coagulopathy\nwas cured in all 23 patients who survived more than 10 days post-OLT.\nSix of 16 patients (37%) with HCV cirrhosis pre-OLT developed biopsy-\nproven HCV at a mean of 9 months post-OLT. Three of the 4 HBV\npositive patients also developed disease recurrence.\nConclusions OLT cures the coagulopathy of haemophilia. HCV\ncirrhosis is the commonest indication for OLT but outcome may be\ncomplicated by the effects of HIV co-infection or by graft-recurrence of\nHCV.\nABERRANT EXPRESSION OF P53 AND KI-67 DURING ACUTE\nAND CHRONIC REJECTION FOLLOWING ORTHOTOPIC\nLIVER TRANSPLANTATION\nMM Dollinger\"2 iN Plevrs', A Graham2, SEM Howie2, PC Hayes',\nDJ Harrison2.

Unlike apoptosis, proliferation\nand its role have not been ivesigad in hepaic graft rqection\nthusfr. Ki-67 is a common marker of cell growth, while p53 is able\nto inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis as a response to DNA\ndamage. Aim: To sudy the of p53 and Ki-67 in the liver\ntissue during acute and chronic rejection (AR\/CR). Medtods:\nParaffi-embedded liver biopsies of 10 patients with AR before\/after\ntreatment with i.v. steroids and of 13 patients with CR were studied\nby immocytochanistry, using mononuclear antibodies agant p53\nand Ki-67. Results were assessed semi-quantitatively and compared to\nnormal controls. Results: p53 was expred in hepatocytes, bie\nducts (BD) and cells of the ilmmtory infilrate during AR and CR,\nwhile no reactivity was detectable in normal controls. Treatment with\nsteroids did not affect the expression. Staining for Ki-67 showed an\nincreased expression in inflammatory cells and hepatocytes during\nboth types of rejection compared to controls, while bile ducts reacted\nsporadically only during chronic rejection. Steroid treatment reduced\nthe number of Ki-67 positive cells of the inflammatory infiltrate.\nConclusion: The expression of Ki-67 indicates, that during acute and\nchronic rejection proliferation is upregulated in both, infiltrating\ninflammatory cells and parenchymal cells. Additional\nimmunosuppressive therapy suppresses the proliferation of the\ninflammatory cells. p53 seems to be implicated in the immune\nresponse, either as a response to the increased proliferation rate or to\naccumulation ofgenome damage.\nSERUM GLUTATHIONE-S-TRANSFERASE a (GST) IN\nACUTE LIVER ALLOGRAFT REJECTION\nA. Nagral. P. Butler. C.A.Sabin.* B.R. Davidson. K. Rolles.\nA.K. Burroughs. Liver Transplantation, Primary care and\nPopulation Sciences,* Royal Free Hospital, London NW3 2QG,\nUK\nIntroduction\/Aim: GST has been suggested as a sensitive\nmarker of cellular rejection. This study was performed to\ndetermine the utility of GST as a marker of acute rejection.\nMethods: Daily measurements of serum transaminases and\nGST (enzyme immunometric assay, Biotrin) were prospectively\nrecorded in 23 consecutive liver transplant recipients for the\nfirst 20 days post transplantation. 56 liver biopsies performed\nfollowing clinical\/biochemical deterioration in liver function; 38\nshowed acute rejection.\nResults: GST peaked on the 2nd day (median 125 pg\/l, range\n75-321 pg\/I) after transplant and preceded the ALT peak by one\nday. GST levels then steadily declined, reaching baseline by\nday 6 and plateauing till day 8. Even after the initial peak, GST\ncorrelated well with the ALT in the majority of patients median\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.6 (IQ range 0.45-0.77); and with the\nbilirubin, median corelation coefficient 0.47 (IQ range 0.14 to\n0.6). There was no significant difference in the GST levels\nbetween rejection and other causes of hepatic dysfunction on\neach of 3 days preceding, and the biopsy day. ALT levels had\na high sensitivity for rejection (97.4%) but a low specificity\n(16.7%) GST did not improve these values. In 16 patients\ntreated for moderate\/severe rejection, the improvement in the\nhistological score of rejection was not associated with a\nconsistent change in GST.\nConclusion: GST does not offer any advantage compared to\nALT in diagnosing rejection or determining response to\ntreatment of rejection.\nGRAFT DYSFUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITHAUTOIMMUNITY\nIN PAEDIATRIC LIVER TRANSPLANATION.\nN Kerkarl, N Hadzic', ET Davies2, B Portmann3, M Rela4, ND\nHeaton4, D Vergani5, and G Mieli-Vergani'.

Five were male and the median age at\npresentation was 10.3 years (range 2-19.4). The median period after\nsurgery was 24 months (range 6-45). The indication for\ntransplantation were extrahepatic biliary atresia (4), Alagille's\nsyndrome (1), drug induced fulminant liver failure (1) and alpha-1-\nantitrypsin deficiency (1). Four were on triple immunosuppression\nwith cyclosporin A, azathioprine and prednisolone, while three were\non tacrolimus. Infectious and surgical complications were excluded.\nLiver biopsy showed the histological changes of chronic active\nhepatitis including portal and periportal hepatitis with lymphocytes\nand plasma cells, bridging collapse, perivenular cell necrosis without\nchanges typical of acute or chronic rejection. All patients had\nincreased levels of immunoglobulin G (median 23.7 g\/L (range 17.2-\n34.4)] and elevated titres of autoantibodies. All but one responded to\nprednisolone 2 mg\/kg\/day and increase or addition of azathioprine\n(1.5-2 mg\/kg\/day) within a median period of 22.5 days and remained\nin remission on a reduced dose of prednisolone (0.05-0.1 mg\/kg\/day)\nand the same dose of azathioprine during follow up (median 250\ndays).\nOur data show that manifestations diagnostic of autoimmune\nhepatitis, and responsive to the classical treatment for this condition,\ncan appear in liver transplant patients while on immunosuppression.\nWhether autoimmune manifestations precede, and may be the cause\nof, graft dysfunction remains to be established in a prospective study.\nA17\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW69\nW70\nW71\nW72\nALULIARY LIVER TRANSPLANTATION FOR METABOLIC\nDISEASES\nBaker A, Rela M, Gibbs P,Muiesan P, Vilca-Melendez, HK Bali C, Mieli-\nVeai G, Heaton ND\nDepartment of Child Heal and Liver Transplat Sugical Service, Kings\nCollege Hospital, London SE5\nLiver transplatation has beo used successfuly to replace the deive\nor missing eymefproten or reospor site in liver-based metaboic disorders.\nThe majority of ths disordes produce cirrhosis and total liver replacwmet\nis required.

However, the frequency of alcohol relapse,\nand its effects on long-term graft and patient survival, remain unclear.\nAims: To review the outcone of transplantation for ALD in a single centre\nover the past 10 years, with particular emphasis on survival and recidivism\nafter OLT. Methods: From Jan 1987 t6 Sept 1996, 111 patients (98M,\n13F; mean age 51 yr, range 33-69 yr) underwent OLT for Child's B or C\nalcoholic cirrhosis, after an alcohol abstinence of> 6 months. In 89 patients\n(80%!.), alcohol was the only aetiological factor, while 20 (18%\/0) also had\nchronic B or C hepatitis and 17 (15%) had developed hepatoma as a\ncomplication of ALD. Post-transplant, alcohol relapse was assessed by\noutpatient and case note review, and by a Severity of Alcohol Dependence\nQuestionnaire sent to transplant survivors. Result: 19 deaths (all males)\noccurred in the first 3 months -- due to sepsis or cardiac complicatons in\n14 (74%). A further 12 patients (IOM, 2F) died 0.9-7.5 yr (median 1.6 yr)\npost-transplant, most frequently due to hepatoma recurrence (n=3) or other\nmalignancies (n=4). The actuarial survival rate for the 111 patients was\n79o\/o at one year, and 64% at 5 years -- compared with figures of76% and\n69% in 700 patients transplanted for other chronic liver diseae. Of the 92\npatients who survived at least 3 months post-transplant, 18 (201\/) reported\nat least one episode of drinking > 3 units daily, while a similar number\nadmitted to 'social' drinking, after a median period of abstinenco of 9\nmonths. Five patients developed recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis\/graft failure\nwithin 5 years -- two of whom died at 10-24 months. Codusnui : Long-\nterm survival after OLT for ALD is similar to that fbr other liver tanusplant\nrecipients. In our experience, alcohol relapse occurs in a large minority of\npatients, though at lower levels of alcohol intake than previously. In those\nwith problermatic drinking post-transplant, graft damage occurs rapidly.\nCLINICAL OUTCOME AND rILow CYTOMETRIC (FACS)\nIGG CROSSMATCH IN LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.\nM McCarthy, PT Donaldson, M van Dam*, and Roger Williams.\nInstitute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital, London SE5 9RS,\nand *Dept of Tissue Typing, St Mary's Hospital, London W2.\nIntroduction: The role of preformed donor-specific IgG allo-\nantibodies. in kidney and heart grafts is well established. However,\nalthough a number of recent studies have suggested that these\nantibodies may increase the risk of both rejection and early graft failure\nin liver transplants,12 this remains controversial.3 The differences\nbetween studies may simply reflect variations in the sensitivity of\nmethods used to detect these antibodies. In the present study we have\nsought correlation between preformed IgG antibodies and clinical\noutcome using two different crossmatch techniques. Methods:\nBetween May 1995 and June 1996, 82 adult liver allograft recipients\n(34 females, 48 males) were examined for the presence of pre-formed\ndonor-specific IgG allo-antibodies using flow cytometry (82 cases) and\na standard microcytotoxicity assay (65 cases). Results: A flow\ncytometric crossmatch was detected in 18\/82 (22%\/), however only 9\/15\nflow cytometric antibody positive patients were antibody positive by\ncytotoxicity assay. Patients with FACS positive crossmatches were\nmore likely to develop two or more episodes of acute cellular rejection\n(4\/18 cf 4\/64, p = 0.044, RR = 4.29), and more likely to develop\nhepatic artery thrombosis (3\/18 cf 1\/64, p = 0.009, RR = 12.6). At\nfollow-up survival was 80%!. in those who were FACS negative and\n67\/o in those with FACS positive IgG antibodies. However, despite a\nclear trend the survival analysis did not reach statistical significance (p =\n0.31). Conclusions: These results confirm the greater degree of\nsensitivity of flow cytometry for the detection of IgG positive\ncrossmatches and suggest that flow cytometry may help predict those at\nrisk of developing severe graft rejection or hepatic artery thrombosis.\n'Takaya et al.

We assessed LFT's and two\nmarkers of hepatic fibrosis; pro-collagen m peptide (PUTP) and tissue\ninhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TI) in patients admitted to an al-\ncohol rehabilitation unit.\nMethod:. We recruited 24 patients with a history ofalcohol abuse,\nbujt no evidence of liver disease of another cause. Seven consecutive\ndaily blood samples were obtained. Measurements of nutritonal status\nand withdrawal severity were made. Our arbitrary criteria for worsen-\ning ofLFT's were: a 50% rise from baseline value with the elevated\nvalue above the laboratory normal reference range\nResuls: 7 out ofthe 24 subjects (29.2\/o) showed worsening of\ntheir LFT's (95% confidence interval 11.0%-47.4%). These patients all\nshowed a rise in both AST and ALT of imilar proportion, but not of\ngamma GT, bilirubin, kaline phosphatase, cr n knase or CRP.\nThere was no significant difference between the group who showed\nworsening and the others who teided to show improving trans-\nminases with respect to baselint linical, nutritional or laboratory\nfindings, or short-tenn outcome.\nPIIP levels increased in both gro:.Ds from day I to day 7 (P=0.05).\nTEMPI levels tended to rise in the group with worsen trans-\naminases, but tended to fall in the other group. (P=O.09)\nCondusion: This study confirms the clinical imprson that wors-\nening ofAST and ALT is common in alcohol withd l. Alcohol\nwithdrawal is associated with a rise in PElP, and a rise in TEMPI in\nthose with worsening transaminase. We conclude that acute alcohol\nwithdrawal may be associated with an increase in hepatic fibrosis.\nA18\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nNutrition W73-W82\nW73 W75\nW76W74\nWHY DO PATIENTS WITE WEIGHT LOSS HAVE A WORSE\nOUTCOME WHEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR\nGASTROITESTINAL MALIGNANCIES?\nH.J.N. Andrevev, A.R Norman, J. Oates, D. Cunningham.\n(HJNA is funded by the BDF) the Gastrointestnal Unit, Royal Marsdmen\nHospital & the CRC Centre of Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer\nResearch, Sutton, Surrey.\nAims: To examine whether weight loss at presentation for\nchemotherapy for gastrointestinal carcinomas influences outcome and\nwhether nutritional intervention could be worthwhile.\nMethods: Data were gathered prospectively. The outcomes were\ncompared of patients with or without weight loss treated for locally\nadvanced or metastatic tumours of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas,\ncolon or rectum.\nResults: Of 1,555 consecutive patients included, weight loss was\nreported more commonly by men (51%) than women (44%) at\npresentation (p=0.01). Patients with weight loss received less\nchemotherapy but developed more frequent and more severe dose\nlimiting toxicity - plantar-palmar syndrome (p<0.0001) and stomatitis\n(p<O.OOl) - than patients without weight loss. Consequently, patients\nwith weight loss on average received I month less treatment (p<0.0001).\nWeight loss correlated with shorter failure free (p<0.0001, Hazard\nRatio=1.25) and overall survival (p<0.0001, Hazard Ratio=1.63),\ndecreased response (p=0.006), quality of life (p<0.0001) and\nperformance status (p<0.0001). Patients who stopped losing weight had\nbetter overall survival (p=0.0004). Weight loss at presentation was an\nindependent prognostic variable (Hazard Ratio =1.43).\nConclusions: The poorer outcome from treatment in patients with\nweight loss appears to occur because they develop more toxicity, have\nmore breaks from treatment and receive significantly less chemotherapy\nrather than any specifically reduced tumour responsiveness to\ntreatment. Randomised nutritional support intervention studies are\nurgently required in these groups of patients.\nRamiambed Da.ble-bM.d l .ofpolmerk vwsm ahmal dlii Uvetalemt of\nacdve Crali's bm&\nS Vermn.

MBBaBlElr,REM.Ha lsRBess r,EMA I,M1GFmthg\nDi[hstw Diseas ReseRh CoIe St B siodm's & The Royal Lndon School of\nMeicine& Dtisry, LmLdonUK\nINTRODUCTION: IBD is frequently associated with loss of appetite and\nbody weight. Healthy individuals, however, adjust their appetite and\nmaintain their body weight within a narrow range. It is proposed that this\ncontrol is due in part to leptin, a newly described hormone, which is\nsecreted by fat cells and acts in the CNS to suppress appetite. In animals,\nadministration of IL-1, and TNF-a, which are both implicated in\ninflammatory cachexia, increase circulating leptin levels and induce\nanorexia and weight loss. The aim of this study was to explore the\nhypothesis that patients with IBD in relapse fail to increase their appetite\nin response to weight loss due to inappropriately raised serum leptin\nconcentrations. METHODS: Serum leptin concentrations were measured\nby radioimmunoassay in 35 (17 men) control subjects and 72 patients (34\nmen; 52 Crohn's, 20 UC) with IBD. Body mass index and % body fat was\nrecorded. Loss of appetite was assessed on a 4 point scale from \"not at all\"\n(score 0) to \"very much\" (3). Disease activity was assessed clinically and\nby measurement of the ESR and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Serum\nleptin concentrations in the controls was 8.0 (3.1-14.1ng\/ml, median[initerquartile range]) and 4.8 (2.6-10.Ing\/ml) in the IBD patients. Serum\nleptin concentrations were highly correlated with % body fat (figure) in\nthe control group (r = 0.84, P = 0.03) and IBD patients (r = 0.82, P 0.006);\nthe difference in leptin concentrations between the two groups was\naccounted for by lower body fat in the IBD patients.\nE 60 The relationship between %\n0 A of body fat and serum leptin40 concentrations in 35 control\nLiI20 0I1 subjects (A) and 72 patientsiQ 20 with IBD (o). The\n0O \u00b00_ regression lines (not shown)for the 2 groups of patients\n00 20 40 were almost superimposed.\nBody fat (%)\n12 patients (6 men) had moderate\/severe anorexia (grade 2\/3) associated\nwith a disease relapse (ESR>30mm\/h, CRP>40). Serum leptin of these\npatients (4.3[3.2-8.lng\/ml]) was no different when compared to healthy\nand quiescent disease controls (5.3[3.5-10.6ng\/ml]) matched for sex and\n% body fat (mean 24.2%, range 4.8-43.9). CONCLUSION: Serum leptin is\nappropriately suppressed in patients with anorexia and IBD. In contrast to\nthe animal work, this study does not support a role for leptin in cachexia\nassociated with IBD.\nRAPID COLONIC FERMENTATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH\nSYMPTOMf IN EBS AND CORRECTED BY EXCLUSION DIET.\n*T.S King, M. Elia, *J.Q. Hunter. *Department of Gastroenterology,\nAddenbrooke's Hospital, 'Dunn Clinical Nutrition Centre, Cambridge.\nIntroduction: Use of an exclusion diet reduces symptoms in 50%\nof IBS patients. Food intolerance is unlikely to be immunologically\nmediated but may be related to colonic fernentation. Methods: 5\nfemale IBS patients and 4 female controls followed two fixed diets\n(12.5g NSP, 128g starch, 3.6g resistant starch\/day; 8MJ\/d. adjusted to\nestimated TEE; protein:carbohydrate:fat 15:45:10): a standard western\ndiet (STD) followed by an exclusion diet (EXN), in which common\nsources of food intolerance were prohibited. Subjects followed each\ndiet for 14 days, with a 2 week wash-out period. Food diades were\nfilled daily and all meals were provided from a metabolic kitchen for the\nlast 7 days of each diet. A symptom score was calculated daily. On the\nlast day of each diet total excretion of hydrogen (H2) and methane\n(CH4 were measured for 24 hours in a purpose-built and validated\n1.4m whole-body calorimeter. Breath H2 and CHR concentratons\nfollowing 20Q lactulose were also measured on each diet. Results:\nmean mean mean mean max\nsymptom total H. total CH4 total rate total rate\nscore ml\/24hrs ml\/241rs mlhmi mi\/mn\nstP sty Stp S tp\npatients std 8.3 361 152 0.4 2.5\nexn 5.9 90 84 0.1 0.4\ncontrols std 1.3 147 266 0.3 0.7\nexn 1.5 86 480 0.4 1.2\nRapid gas excretion in the calorimeter was associated with onset of\nsymptoms. Breath concentations of H2 and CH4 after lactulose altered\nin parallel with changes in 24-hour gas excretion in 4\/5 patients and 3\/4\ncontrols. Conclusions: 1) Symptoms are associated with rapid\nexcretion of H2 and CH4, and improvement of symptoms by diet\ncoincides with reduced excretion. 2) The effect of diet on\nmethanogenesis is variable. 3) The reduction in H2 excretion with\nexclusion diet is consistent with the expected low colonic avalability of\neasily digestible rice starch. However changes in gas excretion during\nlactulose breath tests demonsae that qualitaive changes in colonic\nfermentation also occur. These factors may explain the efficacy of\nexclusion diets in LBS.\nA19\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW77\nW78\nW79\nW80\nA RANDOMISED DOUBLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF\nLONG CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (LCT), MCT\/LCT AND MEDIUM\nCHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (MCT) DURING PARENTERAL\nNUTRION\nA Dennison* J Jameson*, K Maden\", N Bird** and R Law\"\n*Deatment of Surgery, Lecese Gerl Hospital and ** Univety\nDepartment of Surgery, Royal Hla re Hospital, Sheffield UK.\nThe best non-nitrogen calorie source duriW parenteral urition\nremains controversial.

There were no adverse clinical\nreactions in any of the groups. Cardiovascular and respiratory\nparameters and routine haematological, biochemical and acid base\nmeasurement were unchanged. Differences were demonsrated in\nbilirubin levels where LCT (72.3 \u00b1 31 mmolA mean \u00b1 sem) was\nsignificantly higher than MCT (19.6 \u00b1 6.1) or MCT\/LCT (23.4 \u00b1 12.5),\n(p = 0.025). Levels of free glycerol were also reduced in the LCT\ngroup (1.28 \u00b1 0.1 mmol\/l) compared with MCT (2.48 \u00b1 0.23 and\nMCT\/LCT (2.67 \u00b1 0.27) p<0.001). There was also a trend towards a\nhigher white blood cell count in the LCT group.\nThis study demonstrates that 20% MCT emulsions are safe for\nroutine clinical use and also suggests that MCT or MCT containing\nemulsions have advantages metabolically and on liver function.\nGASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX IN PATIENTS FED BY PERCUTANEOUS\nENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY (PEG) - SCINTIGRAPHIC DETECTION.\nKK Balan, S Vinjamuri, J Bennett* and M Critchley, Depart-\nments of Nuclear Medicine and Gastroenterology*, Royal\nLiverpool University Hospital, Liverpool L7 8XP U.K.\nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the method\nof choice for long-term enteral nutrition in patients unable\nto swallow due to a variety of medical conditions. PEG\neliminates the need for surgical gastrostomy and nasogastric\ntubes, is easily performed with few demands on health serv-\nice resources. Aspiration pneumonia may complicate PEG\ninsertion but there are few studies on gastroesophaqeal\nreflux (GOR) in PEG patients.\nMethods: 22 patients (14 M, 8F, aqe 43-83 yrs, median 69)\nwith PEG underwent radionuclide GOR studies. 13 patients\nhad neurological and 9 had mechanical dysphagia. They\nreceived 100 ml of oranoe juice containing 25 MBa of Tc99m-\ntin colloid followed by 301ml of normal saline throuoh the\nPEG tube. Patients lay supine under the gamma camera linked\nto a digital computer system. 4 min. and 4 h images over\nstomach, oesophagus and lungs were examined for GOR and\nlung aspiration.\nResults: 10 patients, 8 of whom with neurological dys-\nphagia and 2 of whom with mechanical dysphagia, had severe\nGOR. 2 other patients with neurological dysphagia had mild\nGOR. One patient with severe GOR also had lung aspiration\nat 4 hrs. 10 patients had normal studies.\nConclusions: 1) Radionuclide imaging is useful in asse-\nssing GOR in PEG patients 2) GOR appears to be a major\np-oblem in patients with PEG and 3) PEG patients with\nneurological dysphagia appear to be at greater risk for GOR\nthan those with mechanical dysphagia.\nOPTMSING CATHETER SURVIVAL IN PERIPHERAL\nPARENTERAL NUTRION: A RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL\nB.M.Dobbins, P.Deady, G.V.Miller, M.J.Tighe, I.G.Martin and\nM.J.McMahon. University Department of Surgery, The General\nInfirmary at Leeds, Great George Street, Leeds, LSI 3EX\nPeripheral vein thrombophlebitis (PVT) is a major obstacle to\nsuccessful and prolonged administration of peripheral intravenous\nnutrition (IVN). This study assesses the impact of glyceryl trinitrate\n(GTN), heparin & hydrocortisone and a combination of both therapies on\nthe incidence and time to onset of PVT during the administration of\nstandard (1200 osm\/kg) peripheral IVN via a fine bore polyurethane\ncatheter. One hundred and eleven patients were randomised to receive\nstandard peripheral nutrition with either a 5mg GTN patch directly over\nthe catheter tip (Group 1, n= 42), heparin 1500 iu & hydrocortisone\n15mg added to the infusate (Group 2, n=40) or a combination of all three\ninterventions (Group 3, n=-29). Limbs were examined daily and catheters\nremoved if any signs of PVT became evident (pain, swelling, erythema,\ntenderness, increase in , or a palpable venous cord). The\nthree groups were matched for age, gender, indications for IVN and total\nduration of nutritional support.\nThe use of a GTN patch alone (group 1) was associated with a shorter\ntime to onset and higher incidence of PVT than either of the other\ngroups (median catheter suvival 6days (group 1) vs 10 days (groups\n2&3); p<0.03*). There was no additional benifit of GTN in addition to\nheparin & hydrocortisone alone (p=ns* Group 3 vs Group 2). In\naddition, choice of vein significantly influenced cateter survival, since\nsignificantly lower incidence of PVT and longer duration to develop\nPVT was observed when the basilic vein was used (compared to the\ncephalic vein) in all 3 study groups (median catheter survival 10 days\n(basilic vein) vs 6 days (cephalic vein); p<0.01*).\nIn conclusion, a GTN patch alone, and the addition of a GTN patch to\nheparin & hydrocortisone in the infisate, offer no benefit in terms of\nperipheral catheter survival. We would recommend peripheral feeding\nusing heparin & hydrocortisone in the infiusate using the basilic vein\nwhenever possible to optimise catheter survival and reduce morbidity.\n(*Chi squared and Log Rank statistics)\nSALL BOIWL JUICE DIACCARID ACTIVITY IN THE\nPE -TERM INFANT\nCade A, Walters M, Puntis J W L\nDepartment of Paediatrics & Child Health,\nClarendon Wing, Leeds General Infirmary, LS2 9NS.\nConflict exists regarding the efficiency of\nlactose hydrolysis in the premature newborn.\nLactase activity in the foetus appears low, but\npreterm infants fed lactose containing formula\nusually grow without losing carbohydrate in the\nstool. Experimental data both supporting and\nrefuting efficient lactose hydrolysis is\ngenerally derived using indirect assessments. A\nmore direct approach is to measure disaccharidase\nactivity in duodenal fluid or mucosa. One study\nof 8 infants from 26 - 29 weeks gestation\nsuggested that during the first 3 weeks of life,\nlactase activity increased and from the outset\nwas comparable with older children. We have\nobtained duodenal aspirates from preterm infants\nover the first 2 months of life. 40 infants were\nstudied; median (range) gestational age 29 weeks(24 - 40) and birthweight 1260 g (600 - 2550).\n31 were appropriately grown and 9 were small for\ngestational age. Disaccharidases were measured\nby a 2 step colourimetric assay using a standard\nBoehringer Mannheim kit. 34\/56 (61%) of lactase,\n44\/56 (79%) of maltase and 23\/56 (42%) of sucrase\nactivities fell below the lower published\nreference range for older children. There was no\napparent increase in enzyme activities or fall in\nsucrase:lactase ratio with increasing postnatal\nage. Despite this, none of the children showed\nclinical evidence of carbohydrate malabsorption.\nWe conclude that disaccharidase activities are\nfrequently low in the preterm enterally fed\nnewborn compared with older children, however,\nthe absence of clinical evidence of lactose\nmalabsorption suggests that undigested lactose is\nassimiliated in the colon. There is probably no\nreason for preterm formula milks to contain less\nlactose than breast milk as many do at present.\nA20\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nInflammatory bowel disease W83-W104\nW83W81\nW82 W84\nInteinal trasit and release characteristic of 2ancreatin\nenzyme microsaheres.\n'S Ghoul, lCj Taylor, 2p Hillel.

The rai 37 (31 UC, 6 CD) had had a\nprevious diagnosis of IBD b this had not been recgnised when\nthey were iited to be screened. The prevalence of previoy\nundeeted IBD in ose offered screening was 73\/10' (95%cl 54-\n92\/105) for UC and 2.7\/105 (95%cl 0.3-10\/10') for CD. Based on\nthose accepting screening the prevaknce of unded UC was\n123\/10' (95%cl 90-155\/105) and for CD 4.5\/105 (95%cl 0.5-\n16\/10'). The prevalence of undeectd UC was higher in the over\n60s and also was almost two-fold higher m men ta wome (164\nv.87\/105). Proctosigmoid UC aounted for 54% (31\/57) of cases\nand pan colitis for 20% (11\/57). 82% (47\/57) had some symptoms\nbut had not consulted or had not been referred for investigation;\n62% reported rectal bleeding and 60% had mild diarto.\nThe prevalence of undetec UC is much greater than\npreviously reported. Prevalence is higher in men, increases with\nage, and low-grade symptoms are common.

Of the 17 patients who had a body mass index\n(BMI) below the desired range of 20-25 kg\/mf 15 had one or\nmore deficiencies. The majority of deficient patients, however,\nhad BMI values within the desired range. The median age of\nthe deficient patient group was lower at 59y compared with\n69y in the non-deficient group (p=0.002, Mann Whitney\nU test). Overall the prevalences of specific deficiencies were\n9%, 41%, 35% and 22% for thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine and\nmultiple deficiency states respectively.

Records held by the Office for National Statistics since\n1993 permit detailed analysis of mortality in IBD patients, including\ncalculation of the number continuing to die from complications of the\ndisease itself or from colorectal malignancies.\nMethods Patients who died in England and Wales between January 1\"\n1993 and 31I December 1995 inclusive and whose death certificates\nincluded the codes 555 (Crohn's disease\/CD) or 556 (ulcerative\ncolitis\/UC) were identified from Office for National Statistics records.\nResults IBD was listed as a cause of death in 2581 patients, of which\n1146 (44%) had CD and (1435) 56% had UC. CD was the underlying\ncause of death in 462 (40.3%) of patients with CD on their certificate,\nwhereas the figure for UC was 509 (35.0%). The mean age at death for\nthose with CD was 68.2 and 72.3 years (male and female respectively)\nand 70.7 and 76.0 years (male and female) for those with UC. Of those\npatients who had CD or UC as their underlying cause of death, 54 (12%)\nand 25 (5%) were less than 50 years-old, respectively. Colorectal\ncarcinoma accounted for the deaths of 9 (8%) and 23 (24%) of CD and\nUC patients under 50 years-old, respectively.\nConclusions At least 300 IBD patients per annum in England and\nWales continue to die from their disease and its complications despite\nimproved treatment and endoscopic follow-up. Most deaths occur in\nelderly patients, but a surprisingly high number of younger patents\ncontinue to die either from their disease (CD patients) or from colorectal\ncarcinoma (UC patients). Further study, such as by national confidential\nenquiry, may identify reasons for these deaths and lead to improved\nsurvival ofIBD patients.\nA21\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW85 W87\nW86 W88\nINFLAMEATORY BOWEL DISEASE IN A\nNATIONAL BIRTH COHORT\nSM. Mantgomerv. D. Morris, N. Thompson, J. Subhani,\nS. Ebrahim, RE. Pounder, and AJ. Wakefield.\nInflammatory Bowel Disea Study Group, Department of\nMedicine, Royal Free Hospital School ofMedicine, London.\nAim: A birth cohort withpse ly collected data was\nused to investigate the prevale of imatory bowel\ndiseas (IBD) at age 26 ye and the association of\nchildhood diseases with disis of IBD.\nMetbods: The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) is a\nlongitudinal study of everybody born in Grea Britain\nbetween 5 - 11 April 1970. A survey of Crohn's disease and\nulcerative colitis was c t at the age of 25\/26 years,\nwith 9,800 (85%\/a) re ing. Diis of IBD, using\nstandardised crita, was confirmed by cohort members'\nphysicians and by histology. Reports of otitis media and\neczema were collected prospectively at the ages of 5 and 10\nyears.\nReslts: By age 26 years, 24 cases of Crohn's disease and\n20 cases of ulcerative colitis had boen diagnosed,\nrepresenting prevalence rates of 2.45 and 2.04 per 1,000\nrespectively. The earliest diagnosis of IBD had been made at\nage 12 years. Otitis media at 5 years was significantly\nassociated with ulcerative colitis (relative risk=4.00, 1.20 -\n13.30), but not Crohn's disease (0.44, 0.06 - 3.31). Eczema\nat 10 years was associated with ulcerative colitis (4.88, 1.85 -\n12.86), but not Crohn's disease (0.81, 0.19 - 3.53).\nConclusions: A very high prevalence of IBD, particularly\nCrohn's disease, was found amongst British 26-year olds.\nOtitis media and eczema were significantly associated with\nfuture ulcerative colitis, but not Crohn's disease.\nTREATMENT OF REFRACTORY INFLAMMATORY BOWEL\nDISEASE WITH GRANULOCYTE APHERESIS\nHJ Rembacklen HE Newbould, MF Dixon, RS Bwy, M Hedrikwc, DM Chalmers,\nATR Axon. Centre for Digestive Disease, The General Infirmiry, Leed, UK\nUncontrolled studies have suggested that leucocyte apheresis may be a useful\nin the trtment of inflammatory bowel diseae (IBD). We report the results\nof a pilot study evaluating tie use of granulocyte aphereis in patients who had\nfailed to respond to sndard medical dterapy.\nEighteen patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and six with active\nCrohn's disease (CD) were recruited. These patients had not responded to\nprednisolone and, in most cases, azathioprme and 5-ASA compounds.\nGranulocyte apheresis was performed weekly uswing a column (GI, Otsuka\nPharmacetc Co. Ltd). Response was sessed by symptom indices,\nsigmoidoscopy, histological scoring and leucocyte sci ing.\nIn UC, 3 patients went into remission and the overall clinical symptom\nscore for all patients, fell from a median of 9 on entry to 3.5 after four weeks\n(Wilcoxon P-value=0.012). There was a statistically significant improvement\nin the mucosal appeare at sigmoidoscopy at entry compWred to after four\nweeks treatment (mean change -0.53, Wilcoxon P-value=0.016). The\nhistological score also improved from a median of 5 to 4 (Wilcoxon P-\nvalue=0.096).\nOne patient with CD withdrew due to dizziness, 1 achieved remission\nand there was a reduction in the median CDAI score from 306 to 177.5 after\nfour weeks treatment (Wilcoxon P-value=0.09). The leucocyte scintigraphy\nscore also improved from a mean value of 2.5 at entry to 1.5 after four weeks\n(Wilcoxon test, P-value=0.25). There were no significant change in median\nhaemoglobin, white cell or platelet counts during the study. There were no\nchanges in laboratory values that caused concern and the procedure was well\ntolerated both by in- and out-patients.\nThis is the first study looking at granulocyte apheresis in patients with\nsteroid resistant IBD. Our data suggests that the treatment is both feasible and\nsafe and may have be effective in both UC and CD. However, larger,\ncontrolled studies are required.\nSOCLAL IMPLICATIONS OF CHILDHOOD CROHN'S\nDISEASE;\nGA Moody, JA Eaden& JF Mayberry\nA validated questionnaire investigating quality of life was\nmailed to the parents of all child members of Crohn's in\nChildhood (CICRA) (age 5-17). 64 questionnaires were\nretuned along with 35 from patlents in the adult age wnge(not analysed). The mean age of patients interviewed was14.1 + Z.8, (range 6-17), with equal numbers of males tofemales. The mean duration of illness was 4.9 i 3.3 years;\npatients had 1.4 + 0.7 operations (range 0 - 6). Of the\nchildren investigated over half had si' ficant absences from\nschool (60%), with a mean of 3 2 months off school in\nthe previous year. Many felt their teachers lkew nothing\nabout CD (53%) and that they were unsvmnathetic (50%).\nOf the 24 who had taken examiations 80% thought they had\nunderachieved because of ill health.\nPatients were asked whether they were able to perform\nseveral everyjday childhood activities. The following table\nsummanses their responses;\nSometimes Never Always\nPlay outside with\ntheir friends 28 42% 5 8% 33 50%\nGo out 37 56%) 3 4% 26 40%\nTake part in sport 41 (63%) 3 (4% 22 23%\nGo on holiday 25 38%) 0 41 62%)\nStay overnight at afriends house 25 (38%) 8 (13%) 33 (49%)\nThe commonest questions asked be the children were (i)\nwhat is CD? (50%) (ii) why me? (i4%), (iii) will it affectmy schooling (52% and (iv) will t affect my chnces ofgetting a job (67%)\nIn conclusion children with CD have a sigmfatly impaired\nquality of life they fear every day childhd activities and\ntheir future. \u00b6lhey need sympathetic management and effort\nshould be concentrated on improving teir day to day\nexistence to enable them to lead a normal a life as possible.\nVI\nI\nA22\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nW89\nW90\nW91\nW92\nA RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ESSENTIAL FATTY\nACIDS (EFA) IN ACUTE ULCERATIVE COLTIS(UC).\nStack WA, Cole AT, Makhdoom Z*, Murray FE, Cullen DE, Stewart\nJCM\u00b6, Everitt SE, Holmes G* and Hawkey CJ.

Omega-3 EFA appear to be of more limited benefit in\nacute ulcerative colitis and possible synergy with omega-6(plant oil)\nEFA has been suggested. We therefore carried out a randomised double\nblind controlled trial of omega-3 and omega-6 EFA supplementation in\nacute UC to detennine if they reduced steroid requirement and to\ninvestigate if synergism existed between them.\nMetods: Patients with acute relapse of colitis were randomised to\nreceive omega-3 EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid l.5g), omega-6 EFA\n(gamma linolenic acid 2.1g), both or placebo daily for four months.\nPrednisolone use was systematically reduced using a standard\nwithdrawal protocol. As the trial was exploratory, the main analysis was\nof steroid use in patients treated per protocol by logistic regression\nanalysis.\nResults: 66 (36F) patients were randomised to treatment and 53\ncompleted the study. 6 patients withdrew due to severe exacerbations of\nUC (2 placebo, 2 omega-3, and 1 each omega-6 and both groups), 4\nwithdrew because of side effects (I each group), and 3 defaulted from\nfollow up. Daily mean prednisolone (\u00b1SD) for all groups was\n19.8\u00b19.6. 11.4\u00b19.1, 8.9\u00b19.3 and 7.2\u00b18.lmg\/d for months 1 to 4\nrespectively (p<0.001; month 1 to 4 ).There was no significant\ndifference in mean daily prednisolone requirement in patients treated\nwith omega-3 and omega-6 EFA either alone or together compared with\nplacebo (Table).\nMonth I Month 2 Month 3 Month4\nOmega-3(14) 16.4\u00b16.6 11.1\u00b19.9 9.8\u00b110.0 7.6\u00b19.8\nOmega-6(13) 21.8\u00b17.1 13.7\u00b18.7 8.4\u00b18.6 7.0\u00b16.4\nBoth (13) 21.6\u00b15.9 12.3\u00b110.8 9.4\u00b17.6 7.5\u00b19.8\nPlacebo (13) 22.8\u00b13.5 8.6\u00b17.3 7.9\u00b111.0 6.7\u00b18.0\nSimilar findings were obtained when results were compared on an\nintention to treat analysis.\nConclusion: In acute UC we could find no steroid sparing effect with\nomega-3 or omega-6 EFA supplementation compared with placebo\nwhether given alone or in combination.\nMACROSCOPIC AND HISTOLOGICAL INACTIVITY IN\nULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) SURVEILLANCE: A GOOD\nPROGNOSTIC SIGN?\nE Chiotakakou-Faliakou, S Ganesh, K Wilkinson, A Forbes.\nSt Mark's Hospital, Watford Road, Harrow, HAl 3UJ.\nSurveillance colonoscopy in UC is imperfect and expensive.\nBetter targeting of especially high and relatively low risk patients\nwould improve its cost-effectiveness. A clinical impression that\nthe risk of neoplasia is lower in those with persistently inactive\ndisease has been tested. Thirteen cases of confirmed dysplasia\nor carcinoma (n=3) documernted between 1\/1\/93 and 31\/12\/95 in\na major surveillance program, which currenty includes more than\n400 patients with macroscopically extensive colitis of >10 years\nduration, were reviewed. For each case, 2 unresected UC\ncontrols matched for age, sex, and disease duration were\nselected from the database. Contemporary reoords of biennial\ncolonoscopic appearances and the degree of histological activity\nwere compared with those for the patients with neoplasia. At the\nfirst occasion of dysplasia\/malignancy the cases had had a mean\nof 23.1 years extensive UC (controls 23.5y), and had unrgone\n6.8 surveillance colonoscopies (4.9). 58% of colonoscopies in\nthe cases had been reported to show normal appearances or\nquiescent disease, compared to 78% in the controls (x2: p<0.05).\n48% of histological reports in patients with subsequent neoplasia\nindicated inactive disease, compared to 58% in the controls (not\nsignificant). Although persistent macroscopic and histological\nquiescence of extensive UC may be associated with a lower risk\nof progression to early dysplasia\/malignancy, the magnitude of\nthis effect is unlikely to be sufficient to support a reduced\nfrequency of surveillance colonoscopy.\nMUCOSAL AMINOSALICYLATE LEVELS CORRELATE WITH\nCLINICAL ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH ULCERATIVE COLMS.\nF.Hussain.

However the mechanism(s) of the effects of nicotine remains\nelusive. We have investigated whether there are differences in pro-\ninflammatory cytokines IL-1I, IL-6, IL-8 between smokers and non-\nsmokers in ex-vivo LPS stimulated blood.\nMETHODS: 6ml blood were taken from each patient with both active\nand inactive UC and CD (12 in each group; total n=48) and 12 healthy\nvolunteers (7 patients with UC, 11 with CD and 5 healthy volunteers\nwere smokers). Plasma was separated from 3ml of each blood sample\nand other 3ml were incubated for 24 h with 20ng\/ml LPS before\nisolating cell free plasma. All cytokines were measured by sandwich\nELISA (lower detection limit l5pg\/ml). Disease activity was measured\nby Crohn's disease activity index in CD and Truelove and Witts criteria\nin UC.\nRESUTS: Among patient with IBD LPS stimulated IL-Ij and IL-8\nlevels among non-smokers were significantly higher than smokers\n(p<O.05 & P<0.01 respectively). This effect was more pronounced for\nIL-8 levels particularly among active UC and CD patients (Non-smokers\nSmokers; UC(median) 1143: 684 pg\/ml. p<0.001 & CD 954: 630\npg\/ml: p<O.Ol). IL-6 levels were not significantly different between\nsmokers and non-smokers. IL-1p and IL-8 levels also correlated well\nwith disease activity (r=0.543 & r=0.64 respectively). In spite of lower\ncytokine levels, number of monocytes, a primary source of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines, was higher among smokers (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: 1. Non-smokers tend to have higher levels of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines than smokers.\n2. These results indicate one possible way (probably a cytostatic activity)\nby which nicotine is effective among active UC patients.\nMESENTERIC MARGINAL ULCERATION IN CROHN'S\nDISEASE: CORRELATION WITHVASCULAR ANATOMY AND\nCRITICALLY-PERFUSED SITES. A And=y, RE Pounder, AJ\nWakefield, AP Dhillon. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group,\nDepts of Histopathology\/Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.\nRackd=ouxdlAi In Crohn's disease (CD) of the ileum, ulcers lie\nalong the same side of the bowel as the mesenteric attachment (ie.\nmesenteric margin), while the anti-mesenteric mucosa is often spared.\nThe mesenteric and anti-mesenteric borders of the human small intestine\nare supplied respectively by vasa brevia (VB) and vasa recta (VR)\nfeeding vessels. CD affects the terminal ileum more often than the\njejunum. It has been proposed that mucosal infarction, as a consequence\nof primary granulomatous vasculitis, contributes to CD. We tested the\nhypothesis that CD ulcers along the ileal mese ic margin are\nexplained by the existence of VB end arteries within the human ileum\nbut not the jejunum. Metho(&. Post mortem specimens of normal\nterminal ileum and jejunum were dissected from adult cadavers (n-8).\nMesenteric arcade arteries were cannulated and perfused with carbon\n(India) ink with or without prior ligation of single isolated VR or VB.\nSpecimens were fixed and cleared by Spalteholtzes method. The blood\nsupply of the bowel wall and the submucosal plexus was examined by\ndissection microscopy. Tissues were also examined hislgically.\nResukL The submucosal vascular plexus of the jejunum was more\nextensive than that of the terminal ileum. The submucosal vascular\nplexus derived from ileal VB were noted to be end-arteries with little\nor no communication with the submucosal plexus formed from VR.\nLigation of both isolated ileal and jejunal VR prior to carbon ink\nperfusion did not affect filling of the submucosal plexus. Prior ligation\nof ileal, but not jejunal, VB revealed filling defects of the submucosal\nplexus along the mesenteric margin. Cga1IaFOp. In the ileum, VB do\nnot communicate with the main submucosal plexus, (ie. they are end\narteries) suggesting that pathological occlusion of ileal VB would\npreferentially render ischaemic, areas of the ileum along the mesenteric\nmargin. These findings support a vascular hypothesis for CD and may\nexplain the ileal and mesenteric distribution of CD ulcers.\nDFFERENTIAJL EFFECT OF STEROIDS ON NOC OXIDE (NO)\nPRODUCTION BYCYTOKINE STh4ULAED HT-29 CELLS.

E.coli, Listeria and\nStreptococcal antigens have been found in the inflamed bowel wall of\nFrench families with IBD (Yui et al, Gastr terology 1995;108:1396)\nand serum antibodies to a number of orgaisms including Klebsiella\npneumoniae and E. coli occur in IBD. We therefore undertook an\ninvestigation for persistent microbial antigens within IBD affected\ntissues.\nMethods: Formahin-fixed and paraffin-processed sections from\nresected bowel specimens of 53 patients (19 ulcerative colitis [UC],\none with AS; 23 Crohn's disease [CD]; 11 normal tissues from cancer\nresections) were investigated. Control tissue consisted of normal\nhuman small bowel injected submucosally with E.coli, Listeria\nMonocytogenes NCTC 7973, Proteus mirabils and Klebsiella\npneumoniae serotypes K2,3,17,21,26,36 and 50, along with colonic\nbiopsies from a child with E.coli 0114 infection. Sections underwent\nGram-Twort and specific immunohistochemical staining with\nantibodies for E. coli (DAKO B357), L. Monocytogenes (DIFCO 2302-\n50) and K pneumoniae (Biogenesis 5580-5208 and Sanbio-Monosan\n2006), using an immuno-peroxidase technique (DAKO Duet).\nResults: E.coli; positive staining on luminal surface, including ulcers\nin 41% ofUC, CD and normals. Listeria Monocytogenes; two cases\n(both Crohn's disease) showed positive staining confined to mucus\nlayer. Klebsiella Pneumoniae; superficial staining in 14% (4 CD, 2 UC,\n2 nonnal) ofpatients.\nConclusion; Microbial antigens ofE.coli, Listeria monocytogenes\nand Klebsiellapneumoniae are found only on the epithelial surface and\nnot within the affected tissues in inflammatory bowel disease.\nTHE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE\nIN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE AND ANKYLOSING\nSPONDYLITIS.\nRS Walmslev, H Tiwana*, C Wilson*, MJ Hudson **,A Ebringer*,\nRE Pounder, AJ Wakefield.

UK.\nBackground: Occult bowel inflammation is found in up to two\nthirds of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. IgA antibodies to\nKlebsiella pneumoniae (Kleb.p) are implicated in the pathogenesis of\nAS in HLA-B27 positive patients and have been found in inflammatory\nbowel disease (IBD). It has been suggested that the important serotypes\nofKleb.p in AS are K26, 36 and 50. The serotypes involved in IBD are\nunknown. Aims: To define the antibody subclass response and Kleb.p\nserotypes involved in IBD and AS. Methods: Sera was studied from\nHLA-B27 positive AS patients (40), Crohn's disease [CD] (46),\nulcerative colitis [UC] (38), coeliac distase (50) and normal blood\ndonors (40). Direct, Ig subclass-specific ELISAs were performed using\nwhole bacterial and capsular extacts of Kleb.p serotypes\nK2,3,17,21,26,36 and 50. Mean ODs were compared using Student's t-\ntest, significance was taken as p<0.02. Results: Significantly raised\nantibodies compared with normal controls were found in: AS; IgG to\ncapsular extracts of K2,3,21,36,50 and whole bacterial preps. of\nK36,50; IgA to capsular K2,3,17,21,26,36,50 and whole bactena\nK21,26,36,50. CD: IgG and IgA to capsular extracts of all serotypes;\nIgG to whole bacteria K17; IgA to whole bacteria K17,21,26,36,50.\nIgM to capsular and whole bacteria of all serotypes: UC; IgG to\ncapsular K17,36,50 and whole bacteria K3,50; IgA to capsular extracts\nK2,3: Coeliac disease; no elevation.\nConclusion; A broad range ofKleb.p capsular serotypes are\ninvolved in the immune response to Kleb.p in AS, CD and UC. The\nsimilarity of immune response between IBD and AS is further evidence\nof the common association of gut and joint inflammation.\nSMOKING AND APPENDICECTOMY IN TWINS DISCORDANT\nFOR INFIAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD).\nISnhhaaL S Montgomery, S Ebrahim, R Pounder, A Wakefield\nIBD Study Group, Royal Ftee Hospital, London, NW3 2QG, UK\nThese factors have been shown to either be protective (e.g. smoking &\nappendicetomy in ulerative colitis (UC)), or a risk (e.g. smoking in Crohn's\ndisease (CD)), for the development of IBD.

Biochermistry and Gastoen-\nterology Departments, Stobhill NHS Trust Glasgow, G21 3UW, U.K.\nINTRODUCTION: Enteric hyperoxaluna has traditionally been seen\nas the cause ofFe higher incidence of calcium oxalate renal stones in\ninflammaory bowel disease and malabsorption syndromes compared\nto the general population. This study was undertaken to examine un-\nnary factrs contribuing to this increased risk.\nMETHODS: Forty patients with inflammatry bowel disease (IBD)\nwere studied along with 17 healthy contols. Two of 25 patients with\nCrohn's disease had sones confirned (8%), a furhr 5 (20%) had a\nhistry of renal sbone symptoms. None of the 15 pabents wih ulra-\ntve colis (UC) had eihr stones present or a history of renal stone\nsymptoms. Levels of oxalate and calcium (known stone promoters),\nand citrate and magnesium nwn stone inhibitors) were measured in\n24 hour wine xcions.\nRESULTS: Hyperoxaluna was present in 36% of Crohn's pient\nbut none oft UC group. Renal calculior hisry of stDnesym\nwere no more common in hyperoxalurlc Crohn's patet than in those\nwih normnal unnary oxalate output indicating urnary oxalat levels are\nless important in stone development than previously suggested.\nCrohn's patents had significanty lower unnary magnesium and citlrae\noutputs compared to both the control and UC groups. In this study a\ncombined defiiency of unnary magnesium and citrate relative to uri\nnary calcium, as expressed in a Citx Mg\/Ca index (CMC), correlated\nwell with apparent risk of renal calculi. Risk of developing nephrolthi-\nasis was higher in Crohn's disease conpared to UC and was highest\nin Crohn's patints fowing gastrointestinal surgery.\nCONCLUSION: In Crohn's dise a low stone inhibitor\/promoter\nraio seems to be a precondition of stone fomaon, whereas hyper-\noxaluna is not and unnary magnesium depletion may be the critcal\nabomlt in the patnts.

In this cross sectional study we\nevaluated spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMDJ\n(expressed as t score), calciotropic hormones .(PTH, 25 OH)D,\n1,25(OH)2D) and biochemical markers of bone turnover\n(ostecalcin, OC; total alkaline phosphatase, ALP; type I\ncollagen C-terminal telopeptide, ICTP) in 51 CD (30 women, 21\nmen) and 40 'JC (15 women, 25 men) patients. inirty heaithy\nsubjects weze selected as age-matched controls (C) TI-.e L,\nIBD groups were similar for: age (CD=38.7 i 13.2 years,\nUC=34.4 \u00b1 12.5), disease duration (CD=83.5 i 67.7 months,\n'JC=70.9\u00b144.0) and cumulative prednisolone dose (CPD)\n(CD=6.16\u00b15.54 g, UC=6.87\u00b15.84). Spine and femur t scores were\nsimilar in the two groups (spine: CD=1.49\u00b11.46; UC=1.67\u00b11.13;\nfemur: CD=1.89\u00b11.36; UC=1.60\u00b11.03). Based upon the WHO\nguidelines, only 8 4 of CD patients and 15 E of UC patients\nhad a normal BMD, 55 6 'CD) and 67 4 (UC) were osteopenic, and\n37 % (CD) and 18 % (UC) were osteoporotic. The distribution\namong the 3 different diagnostic groups was not significantly\ndifferent between CD and UC groups (p=0. 11) . PTH and 25 (OH) 2D\nconcentrations were not significantly different among IBD\npatients and controls. However, 1,25(OH)D concentrations wer-\nsignificanly lower in CD and UC patients compared to controls\n(CD=28.7\u00b18.6, CU=28.7\u00b19.4, C = 34.6\u00b111.4, p<0.05). Bone\nturnover was increased in UC patients, but not in CD patients,\nas shown by significantly increased concentrations in UC\npatients of both OC (CD=7.77\u00b15.06, UC=10.03\u00b16.24, C=\n6.58\u00b12.87, p < 0.05 vs C) and ICTP (CD=5.74\u00b13.94,\nUC=10.2\u00b18.47, C = 3.48\u00b10.95, p<0.05 vs CD and C). In a\nstepwise regression that included age, sex, disease duration\nand CPD as independent variables, the femur t score was\nsignificantly inversely related to disease duration (r2 =\n0.125, F = 6.06) in CD patients. In UC patients, the spine t\nscore was inversely related to age (r2 0.107, F=5.49), and was\nsignificantly related to sex, and was more negative in males\n(r2 = 0. 3, F - 16.1); the femur t score was significantly\nrelated to sex ( more negative in males) and inversely related\nto the CPD (r2 - 0.283, F=7.3). In conclusion, our data show\nthat IBD ratients have a diffuse osteopenia whose degree is\nnot different in CD and UC; however, bone turnover is\nsignificantly higher in UC. Finally, osteopenia is related to\ndisease duration in CD, while it is related to maleness and\nglucorticoid treatment in UC.\nA26\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nInflsammatory bowel disease TH105-TH1 12\nTH105\nINDUCIBLE NOS (iNOS) IS EXPRESSED IN THE NORMAL\nHUMAN COLON\nP.J.

RT-\nPCR using specific iNOS primers giving a 423bp product and standard\nwestem blotting were performed on fiesh, frozen tissue to evaluate\nexpression of iNOS. Cellular localisation of iNOS protein was\nestablished using ABC immunohistochemistry with a monospecific\niNOS antibody (Santa Cruz). Paraffin-embedded, diseased (n=6) and\nnormal (n=6) colonoscopic and sigmoidoscopic biopsies were\nevaluated for iNOS localisation to exclude the possibility that iNOS\nexpression was secondary to surgical manipulation.\nResults\niNOS mRNA and protein was expressed in all specimens.\nIrrespective of the means by which tissue was obtained, labelling of\niNOS was seen not only in diseased but also in nonnal tissue in both\nepithelial and inflammatory cells of the lamina propria. This staining\nwas neutralised when the antibody was pre-absorbed with iNOS\npeptide illustrating specific iNOS localisation.\nConclusion\nThese results suggest that iNOS is expressed in the epithelium of\nnormal colon in addition to that of ulcerative colitis.

Dunn Clinical Nutrition Centre, Hills\nRoad, Cambridge, UK.\nAin: To determine the effect of conuming diets dffedring in meat\ncontent on concentration of faecal sulphide (mmol\/g wet wdgh ).\nBackground: he dssimimlation of inorganic sulphur compounds\n(SO4, S03 etc.) by sulphate-reducing bactria (SRB) and by the\nfermentation of sulphu amino acids produces hydrogen sulphide (HS-)\nwithin the colonic humen. HS- is a cell poison and Is toic to the colonic\nepithellum by idibition of -oxidation of butyrate. In a study of the\neffect of ditary sulphate on SRB actvity in uleratve colitds (UC)\npatients, terat in dtary sulpht Itke affected sulphide\nprduton in the colon (PItcher et aL, 1996). This study investigates the\ncontribution of sulphu aminD acid in tbe diet to geration of sulphide\nin the colon.\nMetods: Six healthy, male volunte were maintained in a metabolic\nsuite and fed a sequence of five randmised diets, varying in meat\ncontent only (0g, 60g, 240g, 420g and 600g\/day). lbe duaion of each\ntest period was ten days. On days 9 and 10 of each pedod, faecal and\nurine samples were collected for the meurement of sulphde and\nsulphate respectively. Faecal HS- concenons were measurd by the\nadapted methylene blue method (Florin, 1991) and total uinary sulphate\nwas measured by ion exchange chromatography (Florin et al., 1991).\nResults: Mean faecal sulphide concentrations for the diets containing\nOg\/day, 60g\/day, 240g\/day, 420g\/day and 600g\/day respecvely were as\nfollows: 0.216 mmol\/g wet weight (+\/- 0.13 ); 0.268 mmol\/g wet weight\n(+\/- 0.17); 1.09 mmo\/g wet weight (+\/- 0.83); 0.72 mmol\/g wet weight\n(+\/- 0.54) and 2.78 mmoVg wet weight (+\/- 1.63). Mean total urinary\nsulphates Increased from 21.5 mmol\/day on the Og\/day diet to 45.8\nmmolday on the 600g\/day diet (60g\/day- 22.5 mmol\/day; 240g\/day-\n26.5mmol\/day; 420g\/day- 41.8 mmol\/day).\nConclusions: Faecal sulphide excretion Increased with increased meat\nconsumption, in a dose response manner except for the 420g\/day period.\nIntake of meat provides an important source of sulphur containing\namino acids and may have implications for HS- production in UC.\nFurther work is being carried out to investigate the effects of other\nsulphur compounds on HS- production in the human colon.\nPitcher, M.C.L., Magee, E.A.M., Beaty, E.R. and Cummings, J.H.,\n(1996), Gastroenterology, 110: A992.\nFlorin, T.H.J., (1991), Clin.

Dept. of Medicine, Queen\nElizabeth Hospital, Birmingham Bi 5 2TH.\nHydrogen sulphide (H2S) is synthesised mainly by sulphate\nreducing bacteria in the large bowel. The mechanisms by which\nthis highly toxic gas is detoxicated thus preventing mucosal\ninjury are poorly understood. The microsomal enzyme thiol\nmethyltransferase (TMT) is able to detoxify H2S by methylation.\nThe mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese is also able to detoxify H2S\nby conversion to thiocyanate. We have sought activity for TMT\nand rhodanese in the human gastrointestinal tract. In addition, as\na control, we have determined activity of the cytosolic enzyme\nthiol purine methyltransferase (TPMT). This enzyme methylates\nsulphydryl groups on aromatic compounds e.g. 6-mercaptopurine,\nbut is not able to detoxify H2S.\nMucosa was obtained from surgery. TMT assay was performed\nusing mercaptoethanol as the methyl acceptor and co-factor,\ntritium labelled S-adenosyl methionine. TPMT assay was\nperformed using 6-mercaptopurine as the methyl acceptor.\nRhodanese activity was determined by measuring thiocyanate\nproduction from thiosulphate and cyanide\nOesop Stomach Small Right Left Rectum\nhagus intest.

Santoe12, R.J. Erdtsieck', M.van Blankenstein2.\nDept. of Intenl Medicine HI' ad Gastrenterolo9, University\nHospital, Rotterdam, The Nethrands.\nThe aim of this study was to establish the effect of total life\ntime steroid dosage (TLSD) on bone mass in IBD patients on\nongoing or previous steroid treatment The TSLD was calculated\nfor each patient at their first bone mass masuement, performed\nto monitor the effects of steroid tratment.\nBone mass was measured by means of dual energy x-ray\nabsorptiometry (DXA) in the lumbar spine and the femoral neck\nand with single photon absorptiometry in the proximal and distal\nforearm. The obtained data were compared with a normative\nDutch population and transformed into Z-scores (number of S.D.\nfrom zero), corrected for age, sex and menopausal state.\n128 patients were assessed, 118 of whom had received long\nterm steroids without prophylactic supplements. 92 had Crohn's\ndisease, 36 ulcerative colitis. The mean duration of steroid\ntherapy was 102 months (\u00b1 6 months SEM), and the mean daily\nprednisone dose was 13 mg (\u00b1 0,7 mg). Bone mineral densities\n(BMD), measured at the spine (L2-L4), the femoral neck, the\ntrochanteric region, the proximal and distal forearm were -.84, -\n.75, -.83, -.31 and -.61 respectively. Except for the BMD in the\nproximal forearm, all sites were significantly reduced (P<.01). A\nsignificant negative correlation was observed between BMD at\nthe various sites, the TLSD and the duration of steroid treatment,\nespecially when exceeding 100 months. A decrease of BMD > 1\nSD was only found in patients with a TLSD > 7.5 gram\nprednisone. BMD was not influenced by the type of IBD, the\nduration of the disease and the number or nature of resections.\nConclusions: I.Bone mass loss in IBD is related to TLSD and\nthe duration of steroid treatment. 2.The upper limit of a\nrelatively safe TLSP seems to be about 7.5 gram prednisone.\n3.Above this limit patients should be monitored by regular BMD\nmeasurements.\nHYBRID CAPTURE FOLLOWED BY RT-PCR DOES NOT DETECT\nMEASLES RNA N INTESTINAL TISSUE\nC N., Bruce.

Our aim was to\nexamine the relative distribution in distal UC. Methods: On 4\nconsecutive mornings 10 patients (age 33-67; 6M:4F) with\nactive UC extending to the splenic flexure ingested a Eudragit-\ncoated gelatin capsule containing Inl l1 labelled amberlite resin.\nPatients were scanned on the 4th morning immediately prior todosing with X counts, and at 4, 8 & 12h later. The distribution of\nlabel in ascending (AC), transverse (TC), descending (DC) and\nrectosigmoid colon (RS) was expressed as % of total colonic\nactivity. Transit time (TT) through each region was calculated as\nregional counts + X counts x 24h. Similarly, % daily dose (DD)in each region was regional counts + X counts. Results:(mean\u00b1SEM). Averaging the 4 scans, percentage activity wasdistributed as follows: AC 54\u00b14, TC 37\u00b13, DC 7\u00b12 & RS 3\u00b11%.\nThe mean % in the distal colon (DC+RS) was significantly less\nthan in healthy controls [n=101 (9\u00b13% v 33\u00b17%, p<0.002).\nDistal colonic TT was shorter in colitics (3.9\u00b12.1 v 19.3\u00b13.5h),\nand resulted in a smaller %DD resident within this area(0.16\u00b10.09 v 0.81\u00b10.15 x DD, p<0.002). Conclusions:\nFollowing daily dosing of an enteric coated formulation, only\n1\/10th of the total activity within the colon lay in the distal\nsegment (DC+RS) in patients with distal colitis. Limited\nexposure of the inflammed distal colon to topically active oral\nagents may explain the poor response to treatment.\nA28\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nLiver TH113-TH119\nTH113 1\nSAPHENO-PERITONEAL SHUNTING FOR DIURETIC\nRESISTANT ASCITES. S Ryder, J Doran and R Chamley,\nDepartments of Medicine and Surgery, Queen's Medical Centre,\nNotingham, NH-17 2UH.\nBackground. Treatment of diuretic resistant ascites is usually\nby repeated large volume paracentesis, altOugh this is effective,\nit does involve repeated hospitalisations and has a significant risk\nof complications. We have used a surgical anastamis of the\nsaphenous vein to the peritoneal cavity to provide intemal\ndrainage.\nPatfents and Method. Surgery was undertaken in 8 patients, 6\nunder GA and 2 under LA Saphenous vein patency was\nassessed by doppler ultrasound. A groin incision was made, the\nsaphenous vein isolated and a reversed segment anastamosed\nto the reflection of the peritoneal cavity below the inguinal\nligament. All 8 patients had diuretic resistant ascites and had\nbeen treated with at least 4 paracenteses prior to surgery. 5 had\nalcoholic liver disease, I hepatitis B, I hepatitis C and I Budd-\nChiari syndrome. Median follow-up was 15 months.\nResults. Successful shunt formation was achieved in 7\/8\npatients (88%). Frequency of paracentesis was markedly\nreduced following surgery (mean 1.7 per month to 0.1 per month,\np=0.001). Diuretic dose was reduced in 7 out of 8 patients and\ndiscontinued in 5 patients. Surgery failed in one patient due to\ninfection of the wound site. Two further patients developed\nwound infections which required antibiotic therapy. No\nthrombotic or other septic complications occurred. Median\nhospital stay after shunt formation was 6 days (range 2 to 18).\nOne patient later underwent liver transplantation, three further\npatients died at 7,12 and 14 months following shunt creation.\nConclusion. Sapheno-peritoneal shunting is an effective\nmeans of treating diuretic resistant ascites. It does not involve\ninsertion of foreign material into the vasculature and may\nrepresent an alternative to repeated paracentesis without the\nrisks of thrombosis and infection seen with Le Veen shunts.\nTH114\nHIGH DOSE URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (UDCA) IN PRIMARY\nSCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS (PSC): RESULTS AFTER TWO YEARS OF\nA RANDOMISED DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL.\nSA Mitchell, D Bansi, N Hunt*, J Christie, K Fleming* and R Chapman.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology and Nuffield Department of\nPathology, Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.\nAim: Previous trials of UDCA therapy in PSC have shown\nimprovements in liver biochemistry but varying changes in liver\nhistology. We report the results after 2 years of a double-blind placebo\ncontrolled trial of high dose (20mg\/kg\/day) UDCA in PSC.\nMethods: 24 patients (17 male, mean age 54, range 24-81) were\nrandomised to UDCA (n-12) or placebo (n-12). All patients had a\npre-trial liver biopsy and cholangiography. 20 patients had repeat liver\nbiopsy and cholangiography at 2 years. 2 patients were withdrawn\nfrom the study, the first after 6 months from the UDCA group due to a\ndominant stricture which required stenting and the second after 15\nmonths from the placebo group due to recurrent variceal haemorrhage.\nOne patient from the placebo group died from an unrelated cause. Pre-\nand post- trial liver biopsies were staged and graded using a modified\nhistological activity index (HAI) by two histopathologists.\nResults: The two groups did not differ significantly on entry. No\nimprovement in symptoms was recorded. Despite the high dose of\nUDCA used there were no reported side effects. Significant\nimprovement (p<0.05) was observed in the serum levels of ALP (mean\n455 vs 779 iu\/I) and yGT (mean 157 vs 377 iu\/I) in the UDCA group at\n2 years compared with entry levels but changes in the bilirubin and\nAST were not significant. In the placebo group no significant changes\nwere noted. Liver histology revealed an unchanged or improved HAI\nscore in 9\/10 of the UDCA group but a worse score in 5\/9 of the\nplacebo group. Disease stage remained unchanged or decreased in\n8\/10 of the UDCA group but progressed in 5\/9 of the placebo group.\nConclusion: High dose UDCA treatment of patients with PSC is well\ntolerated and associated with a significant improvement in both ALP\nand yGT after 2 years. In contrast to our previous trial (Hepatology\n1992; 16:92A.) using lower doses of UDCA, the majority of the group\ntreated with high dose UDCA had unchanged or improved\ninflammation (HAI) scores on liver histology and 4\/10 showed\nregression of the disease stage.\nMATERNAL AND PERINATAL OUTCOME IN SkEVERE\nPREGNANCY-RELATED LIVER DISEASE. SP Pereira- J\nO'Donohue, J Wendon, Roger Williams. Institute of Liver Studies, King's\nCollege Hospital, London SE5 9RS.\nAcute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) and the syndrome of haemolysis,\nelevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP), are rare but major\ncomplications of the third trimester of pregnancy, with published maternal\nand perinatal mortality rates of approximately 20%\/. Aims: To review the\noutcome of a large group of patients with severe liver dysfunction in late\npregnancy, treated according to a standard protocol for acute liver failure.\nMethods: Over a 10 year period, 46 women (median age 30 yr, range 17-\n41 yr) with a provisional diagnosis of severe AFLP or HELLP syndrome\n(median gestational age 35 wk, range 24-40 wk), were transferred to our\nLiver Failure Unit. Results: At admission, 32 patients (73%) were\npreeclamptic, and 21 (46%) were encephalopathic and\/or ventilated. The\nmedian INR was 1.6 (range 0.9-3.4) and platelet count 107 (19-409x109A).\n40 patients (87%) had a raised serum creatinine (median 210 ILM, range\n63-758 FM). The median serum bilirubin concentration was 113 ILM (17-\n646 lM), rising to a peak value within 48 h of 153 pM (19-646 pM). 32\npatients (70%) had clinical features and laboratory values consistent with\nAFLP, while seven (15%) had HELLP syndrome. In seven other patients,\ncauses of severe liver dysfunction unrelated to AFLP or HELLP syndrome,\nwere found. Infectious complications occurred in 19 of the 39 patients\n(49%) with AFLP or HELLP syndrome - 17 of whom were in the AFLP\ngroup. Major bleeding complications occurred in 12 women (10 with\nAFLP). Nine required laparotomies for clot evacuation, while one with\npreeclamptic liver rupture underwent liver transplantation. None of the\neight patients who delivered vaginally had bleeding complications. Four of\nthe 32 patients with AFLP (12.5%) had a fatal outcome, with a\ncorresponding perinatal mortality rate of 91\/6. There were no maternal or\nperinatal deaths associated with HELLP syndrome. Conclusions: In\ncontrast to many previous studies, the results of this large series suggest a\nrelatively favourable matemal and perinatal outcome in severe AFLP and\nHELLP syndrome.\nPRODUCTION OF ANGIOGENIC AND\nCHEMOATTRACTANT CHEMOKINES DURING\nMONOCYTE:HEPATOMA CELL ADHESION.\nKJ Simnpson, NW Lukacs, H Evanofi RM Strieter & SL Kunkel\n(introduced by PC Hayes). Dept of Pathology and Division of\nPulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan,\nAnn Arbor, , USA 48105.\nThe aim of this study was to determine if interlukin 8 (1L8), a\npotent angiogenic chemokine, and macrophage inflammaory\nprotein la (MEPla), a powerfil chenmotract for monocytes,\nare produced during monocyte adhesion with hepatoma celis.\nMETHODS. Human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and SK Hep)\nwere co-cultured with PBMC for 24 hours and chanokine\nconcentration measured by ELISA. Monocytes and hepatocytes\nwere separated in transwell culture plates (Costar) to determine if\nadhesion was a prerequisite for chemokine production.\nRESULTS. Monocytes alone produced little IL8 (1.46+0.42\nng\/mI, mean + SEM, n=8) and MEPla (0.01+0.01 ng\/ml, n=8).\nHepatoma cells also produced little or no 1L8 (HepG2 0.79+0.04,\nSK Hep 13.23+3.5, n=8) and MEPla (HepG2 0, SK Hep\n0.03+0.01, n=8). Both LS and MEPla concentrations\nsignificantly increased when monocytes were co-cultured with\nHepG2 (IL8 19.58+2.5, MIPla 3.64+0.16, n=8) or SK Hep cells\n(IL8 362.0+80.8, MIPla 3.48+0.58, n=8). Separating PBMC\nfrom the hepatoma cells, using transwell plates, resulted in\nsignificantly reduced concentrations of IL8 (HepG2 5.66+0.43,\nSK Hep 47.9+7.7, n=8) and MIPla (HepG2 0.40+0.03, SK Hep\n0.30+0.06, n=8).\nCONCLUSIONS. Production of EL8 and MEIP occurs during\nmonocyte adhesion with hepatoma cells in an adhesion dependant\nmanner. This may enhance the recruitment of other inflnatory\ncells to the site of a hepatoma, but may also enhance the growth\nand metastatic potential ofthe tumor by promoting angiogenesis.\nA29\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH117 TH119\nPROLIFERATING HEPATOCYTE CELL LINES CONDITION BENEFICIAL IN VITRO EFFECTS OF TUCARESOL ON\nTHEIR EXTRACELLULAR ENVIRONMENT WHILST THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO HEPATMS C VIRUS\nDEVELOPING THREE DIMENSIONAL CONFIGURATION IN A M.LC.mn , S.Chokshi, N.Tzampouras, F.Torre, Roger Williams\nHOLLOW FIBRE CARTRIDGE. and N.V.Naoumov. *hImute of Liver Studies, King's College\nD Floyd', P McCloskey', C Selden', E Roberts2 and H Hodgson'.

Median age was 52\nyears. (range 21-79) 63% had alcoholic cirrhosis. Prior to admission,\n112 patients had bled from oesophageal varices and 40 patients\n(30.7%) were on long term treatment for the prevention of rebleeding.\nDifferences in survival curves using an HVPG of 16mmHg were tested\nusing the log-rank test.\nResults: 41 patients died during the follow up period (median 550\ndays). Using multivariate analysis, previous long term endoscopic or\nsurgical eatmnt (p=0.03), prothrombin time (p=0.005), ascites\n(p=0.000l) and HVPG (p=-0.001) were found to be the only significant\npredictors of survival. Dividing the patients into three groups\naccording to the time of HVPG meurement in wiation to a vaticeal\nbleeding episode (0-7, 8-14, >15 days) the predictive value of HVPG\nwas found to be much higher if the measurment was taken within the\nfirst (p=0.03) or second (p=0.004) week from bleeding.\nCocusion: HVPG mea ent provides ftr progsic\ninformation in addition to that obtained from the ChildPugh\nclassification. In patients with a previous variceal bleed, this pdctive\nvalue is higher if the me ment is taken within two week of\nbleeding.

W. Hall. P. E. Ross, D. Hopwood. Dept of\nMolecular and Cellular Pathology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical\nSchool, University ofDundee, Dundee, DDI 9SY.\nBackground\/Aims: Alginates are used to alleviate symptoms of\nreflux in oesophagus. It has been proposed that they act by forming a\nbarrier to refluxed material. We aimed to develop an animal model to\ndetennine whether alginates also play a more complex role by altering\ncell fimction.\nMethods: Pig oesophageal epithelium was mounted in four Ussing\nchambers. Fluid phase endocytosis was used as a marker of cell\nfunction, therefore the mucosal surface was exposed to a solution\ncontaining FITC labelled 0.02pm latex microapheres. In addition 0,\n0.001, 0.01 or 0.1IpM of alginate A (high m. wt. Laminaria hyperborea\nstem) n=6, B (Lessonia nigrescens) n=5, or C (low m. wt. Laminaria\nhyperborea stem) n=5, were added to the four chambers. Tissue was\nincubated for 1 hr then disaggregated to form single cell suspensions\nwhich were examined using flow cytometry. Measurements were made\nbefore and after the addition ofthe quenching agent trypan blue to\nobtain total and endocytosed fluorescence readings.\nResults: Values are % differences compared to no added alginate.\nEFFECT ON TOTAL\nALG]M A B C\n0.001 + 220\/o(p<0.05) none none\n0.01 - 230\/o(p<0.05) none none\n0.1 - 23o(p<0.05 -_12% (p<0.1) +63 0.05\nEFFECT ON ENDOCYTOSIS\n[ALG]M A B C\n0.001 none + 200\/o(p<0.05) none\n0.01 none none none\n0.1 none -27% (p<0.05 + 39E 0.05)\nConclusions: Depending on their source and structure, alginates are\ncapable of upregulating total or endocytosed fluorescence, indicating\nchanges in cell physiology.

Department of\nGastroenterology, University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The\nNetherlands.\nIngestion of concentrated (80%) acetic acid (CAA) is a form of suicide\npracticed by immigrants from Surinam. To compare the effects of CAA\ningestion to other caustic agents and to determine if early endoscopy is\npredictive, data on 132 adult patients (44% M\/ 56% F), admitted between\n1980 and 1994 for ingest ofa caustic agent, were reviewed. All patients\nwere endoscoped within 24 hours to grade the gastrointestinal lesions\n(grade 0: none - grade 3: severe). Clinical severity wasjudged by duration\nof admission, ICU admission, systemic and local complications.\nResults:\nAgent (n) Endosc. grade (%) Hospitalisaion Systemic Sticture Mortlit\n0 1 2 3 mean (d) ICU complic. f\nCAA(55) 7 18 44 31 7.5 50%\/' 13(24%)' 4(7r\/) 8(l15%)3\nAcid(10) 20 10 30 40 27.0 33% 1(10%\/) 6(605\/)' 0\nAlkali (67) 20 22 28 30 7.0 25% 1(1.5%) 12(lIr\/.) 2(3%)\nICAA vs Alkl: p<.0l; 2Acid vs Alai and CAA: p<0.01; CA vs A p<0.05\nSystemic complications were only seen in grade 2+3 lesions and included\nrenal damage in 8, liver damage in 9, diffuse intravascular coagulon in\n7, and hemolysis in 10 patients. Ten patients died from systemic (CAA:\n8\/55 (15%) and alkali: 1\/67 (1.5%); p<0.05) or local (alkalu 1\/67 (1.5%))\ncomplications. More strictures (mainly oesophageal) developed in grade\n3 (32%\/) than in grade 2 (7V\/) and grade 1 (8%) (p<0.05). Fifteen of22\npatients with a stricture underwent 190 endoscopic dilatations (median: 6,\nrange: 1-84), which were ccesful in only 6. Nine patients needed surgery\nfor perforation (N=5) or failure (N=4). Six stricture patients underwent\ndirect surgical reconstruction.\nIn conclusion: (1) CAA ingestion has a far higher incidence of systemic\ncomplications and mortality than other causfic agents. (2) Early endoscopy\nis safe and gives prognostic information. (3) Endoscopic dilatation for\nstrictures is often unsuccesful and surgery should be considered at an early\nstage.\nOESOPHAGEAL MOTOR DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WI1H\nTHE INDETERMINATE FORM OF CHAGAS' DISEASE SM\nAlmeida, P Martins, DF Evans*, M Sanchez & DL Wingate*. GEN-CAD\nService, Dept of Surgery, UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and *GI\nScience Research Unit, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School\nof Medicine and Dentristry, London, UK.\nPatients with the indeterminate form of Chagas' Disease (CD) are\nseropositive, without megaoesophagus and asymptomatic . Small\nintestinal dysmotility has previously been found in CD patients without\npseudo-obstruction (GE, 1995, 108: A592). Oesophageal dysmotility may\nalso be present without dysphagia or dilatation. We used prolonged,\nambulant, oesophageal manometry to test the hypothesis that motor\nabnormalities precede clinical manifestations ofCD in the oesophagus.\nWe studied 19 patients (12M, 7F, age 24-62) seropositive for CD; all were\nsymptom-free. Recordings were performed for 24 hrs from a manometry\ncatheter incorporating 3 micro strain gauges 7.5 cm apart positioned in the\noesophagus and connected to a digital datalogger; patients were studied\nin hospital but were freely mobile. Data were downloaded for computer\nanalysis of the incidence, amplitude and type (peristaltic, simultaneous,\nincomplete, and retrograde) of oesophageal contractions and compared\nwith published data on healthy controls (GE, 1996, 110: A624).\n74% patients had evidence of impaired oesophageal peristalsis (Median of\nabnormal v normal contractions) (33.75% v 64.6%, p<0.001) and\nincomplete propagation (49% v 23.5%, p<0.002), but no increase in\nsimultaneous contractions (13.3% v 7.6%, p=0.07) or retrograde\ncontractions which were rarely seen (0-3% both groups). Contractile\namplitude, duration and propagation velocity were similar for all patients\nand within normal limits and there was no manometric evidence of\ndilatation.\nThe data confirm that impaired peristalsis precedes the clinical\nmanifestations of oesophageal involvement in Chagas' disease. This is a\nuseful model for the study of the evolution of oesophageal denervation,\nand of the factors that determine progression of oesophageal neuropathy\nthat has an outcome similar to achalasia. Long term surveillance of\nprogression of 'non-specific motility disorders' may be desirable in the\nlight of these findings.\nA31\nGut 1997;40 (suppl 1)\nTH125 TH127\nTH126 TH128\nLOXIGL,UMIDE INHIBITS POST-PRANDIAL TRANSIENT LOWER\nOESOPHAGEAL SPHNCTER RELAXATIONS INPAIENT WITH\nGASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE\nM D to, Stuat Riley.

After a\nfour hour fast, each patient was intubated with a manomneric assembly,\nincrporating a Dent sleeve, and a pH probe and studied supine.\nFollowing a 60 minute bsl period, patients were rndomly assigned to\nreceive intravenous loxiglumide (30g\/kg\/ho for 10 minutes and then\n10mg\/kg\/hour) or placebo. After 20 minutes, a 300m1, 200 kcal, lng\nchain triglyceride meal (Calogen) was infused into the stomach.\nManometric and pH data were recorded for a further two hours.\nTLOSRs ccurred more frequently in the post-prandial peiod during\nplacebo (median 0(range 0-3) to 1(0-15) (p-0.03, Wilcoxon signed rank\ntest)), but not during loxiglumide (O to 0(0-7)). Postprandial TLOSR\nfrequency was significantly rduced during loxiglumide (p-0.04 cf.\nplacebo). Basal LOS pressure fell during the placebo postpdial peiod\nfrom 11(6-27)mmHg to 9(2-29), but not during loxiglumide (14(4-23) to\n14(2-50)) (p-0.05 cf. placebo). Fewer reflux episodes occurred during\nloxiglumide infusion (1(0-8)) than during placebo infusion (2(0-19)), but\nthis difference failed to reach statistical significanc.\nLoxiglumide inhibits TLOSRs and attenuates the fall in basal LOS\npressure following a fat meal in patients with reflux disease. CCK may\nplay an imporant role in mediang the post-prandial increase in\nTLOSRs and fall in basal LOS pressure, suggesting a therapeutic role for\nloxiglumide in the management of reflux disease.\nUhTURAL NXSTMRY OF REFLUX ESOPEAGITIS: A 5-YEAR FOLLOW\nUP STUDY\nF. Pace, G. Manzionna, S. Bollani, G. Bianchi Porro.\nGastrointestinal Unit, L. Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.\nData concerning the natural history of reflux\nesophagitis (RE) are scarce and conflicting: in\nparticular, it is not clear whether or not, in the\nlohg-term, the majority of patients still require\ntherapy. Therefore, we investigated retrospectively\nthe fate of our patients with RE ten years after the\nfirst endoscopic diagnosis. A number of parameters\nwere assessed by means of a structured telephone\ninterview, concerning the outcome of the patient,\nactual therapy (if a,ny), satisfaction with treatment,\nand quality of life, during the last year.'\nResults: the records were retrieved for 288 patients\nwhere a diagnosis of reflux esophagitis had been made\nduring the period 1983\/86. Data were available for 133\npatients (M\/F - 93\/40), followed up for a median\nduration of 9.8 yrs (range 4.6-15.2); 2 patients had\ndied in the zeantime (in both cases for reasons\nunrelated to RE), and 153 patients were no longer\navailable. The vast majority of patients (96%) were\nstill assuming maintenance therapy (in 61% a proton\npump inhibitor [PPI], in 29% a 12-receptor antagonist\n(H2-RA], in 10% other therapies, such as prokinetics,\nantacids, etc). Only a minority (31%) of patients was\nstill symptomatic during the last year of follow up.\nDuring the entire follow up period, 21% of patients\nhad more then three endoscopic relapses, 23% between\ntwo and three, 28% one, and 28% zero, respectively. A\nlarge proportion of patients (79%) was still adopting\nnon-pharmacological measures (diet, posture, etc.)\nsuggested by their doctors. Only 2 patients (1.5%) had\nbeen submitted to surgery for the control of their\nuntractable symptoms\/mucosal lesions. Finally, the\nquality of life (QoL) appeared to bave been partially\nimproved by therapy (in particular by PPIs): 64% and\n11%, respectively, considered their QoL as good or\nexcellent, respectively.\nConclusions: contrary to many previous reports, it\nappears that the prognosis of RE is not favourable; the\ndisease shows a marked trend to chronicity, leads to\nalmost continuous drug assumption for symptom control,\nand is associated with a high relapse risk after\ntreatment discontinuation.\nSIMULTANEOUS AMBULATORY OESOPHAGEAL MOTILIrY\nAND DUODOGASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX\nMES UREI ENT .

Gastroenterology Unit, Royal\nGwent Hospital, Newport, South Wales.\nBackground: Anxiety and depression are\nthought to be more common in patients with\nreflux than control subjects. We examined\nwhether recent unpleasant life events could be\ncontributing to excess psychological morbidity\nin such patients.\nMethods: We studied 165 patients referred\nby general practitioners to our endoscopy\nservice for investigation of reflux symptoms.\nInclusion criteria were primary symptoms of\nheartburn, acid regurgitation and\/or burning\nretrosternal pain. A control group comprised\n79 patients having minor operations under local\nanaesthesia. All patients completed self-\nreport hospital anxiety and depression (HAD)\nquestionnaires and Brugha threatening life\nexperience checklists.\nResults: Among the reflux group 57 patients\nhad hiatus hernia only at endoscopy. 37 had\noesophagitis only, 38 patients had both, 8 had\ngastritis\/erosions\/duodenitis and 40 had normal\nfindings. The reflux patients gave higher HAD\nscores than the control group (mean 27.8 vs\n24.1, p<O.OOl). Life events during the\npreceding year had been no more common among\nthe reflux group than the controls (median of\none event per person in each group), and life\nevent severity scores were no different (median\n5 per person in each group). There was a weak\nbut significant correlation between HAD and\nlife event severity scores in the reflux group\n(r - 0.097, p<O.OOl).\nConclusions: This large study confirms that\nanxiety and depression scores are higher in\npatients with reflux symptoms than controls.\nPersonality traits, and indeed perhaps reflux\nitself, probably contribute more to the excess\npsychological morbidity than life events.\nA32\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH129 TH131\nTH130 TH132\nPATHOLOGICAL GASTROESOPHAGEAL RF:FIUX (GER) 1'\nPATIENTS WITH A GAIltLBLADDER (GB) ILA SI7U AN.lS\nSMALL (;ALLSTONES.\nP Portincasa'.

So far, there is little evidence\nto link the presence ofH pylon with gastr-oesophageal reflux disease.\nSymptoms of gaslro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) are extremely common\nand this study was designed to explore any association between GOR\nand infection with H pylon.\nMethod: Patients with long-standing symptoms of GOR were\nrecruited. Symptoms of GOR were scored using the DeMeester\nquestionnaire. All patients underwent upper GI endoscopy and the\npesence of H pylori was determined using antral biopsy and rapid\nurease test. Patients with either a normal upper GI endoscopy or\noesophagitis were included in the study. Patients with additional upper\nGI pathology or who had received antibiotics and or proton pump\ninhibitors within the previous six weeks were excluded. A control\ngroup of 196 patients matched for sex and age were tested serologically\nusing a Helico G2 kit to determine H pylori status.\nResults: 45 patients were studied (24 male, 21 female, mean age\n49.6 years). The mean DeMeester reflux score was 5.1 (range 3 to 9)\nand symptoms of reflux had been present for a mean of 3 years (range 2\nmonths to 20 years). 32 patients had a normal upper GI endoscopy, 13\npatients had evidence of oesophagitis and\/or hiatus hernia. Only 3\npatients were positive for H pylori and 42 patients were negative. This\ngave a prevalence of 6.7% for the presence of H pylon in the study\npopulation. This was significantly (p< 0.01) less than in the control\ngroup (37.5 % positive).\nConclusions: Routine testing for H pylori in patients with\nsymptoms of GOR is inappropriate and is likely to lead to a positive\nresult in less that 10% of cases. This study has shown, for the first time,\na very low prevalence of H pylori in patients with GOR. Could the\npresence ofH pylori in some way protect against symptoms ofGOR?\nTHE IMPACT OF BREAST FEEDING, ATOPY AND OTHER FACTORS\nON THE PREVALENCE OF GASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX\nAlAtia R. Golding J and Sandhu BK\nInstitute of Child Health,Royal Hospital for Sick Children,Bristol BS2 8BJ\nGastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the involuntary passage of\ngastric contents into the oesophagus. It becomes pathological if its\nfrequency and intensity is increased or if complications arise. A few\nstudies elude to epidemiology of GOR (Carre 1959) but there are no\npaediatric population based studies in this field.\nAims: We have attempted to look at the prevalence of GOR in\nchildren aged 6 months and 18 months and its association with factors\nsuch as breast feeding, social background, atopy, other symptoms and\nhospital admissions.\nMethods: The study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of\nPregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC), a longitudinal population-based\nstudy starting in pregnancy and following all children to the age of 7\nyears. A series of self-completion questionnaires have been distributed\nto mothers and partners at various set times. For the purposes of this\nstudy GOR was defined as being present if a child \"often vomited\".\nVomiting was defined as \"bringing up most or all of the feed\". The\ndata for this study is based on questionnaires completed at 6 and 18\nmonths.\nResults: The prevalence ofGOR in children aged 6 months is 4.3%.\nBy 18 months the prevalence is reduced to 1.5%. At 6 months breast-\nfed infants have a lower prevalence of GOR (4.0%) compared to their\nnon breast-fed counterparts (5.3%) (p<0.001). Serum IgE is not\nassociated with GOR but wheezing and family history of atopy are.\nEczema is associated with GOR at 6 months but not at 18 months. Of\nchildren with GOR at 6 months 26.3% were admitted to hospital, the\nfigure for 18 months is 25.3%.\nConclusions: In this large prospective population based longitudinal\nstudy the prevalence of GOR is 4.3% at 6 months and 1.5% by 18\nmonths. Breast feeding reduces the possibility ofGOR. Wheezing\nand family history of atopy are associated with GOR. Children with\nsymptoms of GOR have a high risk (I in 4) of being admitted to\nhospital.\nFORCES EXERTED DURING OESOPHAGEAL DILATATION\nC A Mosse, T N Mills, D G Bell, C P Swi\nDepartments of Medical Physics, University College, Ipswich General\nand Royal London Hositals.\nAim: An electronic device was designed and built for use during\noesophageal dilatation to allow measurement of the forces exerted on\na bougie dilator during dilatation. Methods: The device featured a\nhandle designed in the shape of hinged split cylinder which could be\nlocked around the dilator but could be readily moved up and down the\nshaft as the dilatation proceeded if necessary. The handle consisted of\ntwo parts, one that gripped the dilator and the other that was gnpped\nby the clinician. One of the members that joined these parts together\ncontained strain gauges arranged as a Wheatstone bridge so that the\nforces transmitted by the clinician's hand could be measured\naccurately. The device was designed to measure and also record the\npush and pull forces exerted during the examination. The force\nmeasurements were recorded using a computer which stored the data\non disk while in real time it displayed the data graphically as a chart\nrecorder style trace on the screen. The device was calibrted against\na range of weights exerting force on a bougie dilator using a pulley\nsystem and was shown to give reproducible linear measurements of\nforce over the range of interest. A series of interchangeable split\ncylinders allowed it to be used with different sizes of dilator. The\ndevice was elecronically isolated from the patient. Resuls: This\ndevice was used to measure the forces at dilatation in 10 patients using\n2 thermoelastic esophageal dilators of 13 and 18 mm diameter (Savary,\nCelestin). Peak forces varied from 0.4 to 3.8 Kg force for the large 18\nmm dilator and 1 to 2.2 Kg for the small 13 mm dilator. The mean\npeak force for the 18 mm dilator was 2.3 Kg and the mean peak force\nfor the 13 mm dilator was 1.5 Kg. The force exerted in order to pass\nthe cricopharyngeus was 0.25 - 1.3 Kg. The length of time dth\nforward thrust was transmitted to the patient's esophagus was 10-21\nsec. Peak retrograde force on removing the dilator was -0.4 Kg. In\nall these cases the clinician felt he was applying only low or modeate\nforce. Conclusion: These measurements represent the first accurate\nmeasurements of the forces exerted during oesophageal bouginage.\nA33\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH133 TH135\nTH134 TH136\nGastrooesophageal reflux is a complication of achalasia\ntherapy.\nM Da , JGC Cox, JR Beaaett, Hall Royal Iafirmary, HuHL\nGas(ooesop_aSW reflux is a ecoised complication ofahalasia\ntherapy, whether by cardio t or by balloon dilatation.\nReflux is ofendI by the patient or the doctor unless it is\nvery troublesome.\nOur seres consists of 176 paients, 38 cases were tt ed surgically\nwhile 138 were tatd with balloon dilatation.

Diagnosis of GORD was\nconfirned by 24 hour ambulatory pH studies. Ninety six patients continued to\ntake proton pump inhibitors and these underwent an additional pH study on\ntherapy. Median age of patient group was 42 years (range 16-82) and median\nsymptom duration was 48 months (3-600). LF was perfonned using 3 to 4\nsutures to create a 2 to 3 cm floppy wrap. There were no conversions. Median\noperating time was 68 minutes (33-330) and the median hospital stay was 2\ndays (0-5). Post-operative assessment was made at a median of 47 days (26-\n76) with respect to symptoms, lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) fimction on\nmanometry and 24 hour ambulatory pH studies. To date 52 patients have been\nfollowed up for over 12 months, 14 over 24 months and two up to 36 months.\nSymptoms assessed independently using DeMeester symptom score improved\nsignificantly from a pre-treatment median score of 5 (2-8) to 4 (2-9) [p=0.02]\nwhile on anti reflux medication but, LF markedly reduced the symptom score\nto 1 (0-6) which was significantly better than both ON and OFF treatment\n[p<0.0001 & 0.0001]. The symptom improvement was maintained at 1,2 and\n3 year follow up (median symptom score 1). Acid exposure of distal\noesophagus ON medication was no different to that OFF medication. [% time\npH < 4 ON was 4.8 (0.5-58.8) and OFF was 7.6 (1.3-25.1) p=0.06]. LF\nproduced effective control of acid reflux which was significantly better than\nboth ON and OFF medication: {% time pH < 4; 0.4 (0-11.5) [p< 0.0001 &\np<0.0001]). The median % time < 4 was 0.6 at one year, 0.3 at two years after\nLF confirming that effective control of acid reflux was maintained. LF also\nproduced significant increases in median LOS pressure from 6 (0-25) to 13.5\n(5.5-27.75) mmHg [p<0.0001]) and length from 2 (14) to 3.5 (2-5) cm\n[p<O.OOOl]). These data shows that LF is effective in controlling the\nsymptoms and distal oesophageal acid exposure in patients with refractory\nGORD for at least 36 months.\nTHORASCOPIC ASSISTED TRANSHIATAL\nOESOPHAGECTOMY- NEW LAMPS FOR OLD?\nMK Lingam.

The advent of minimal access\nsurgery allows accurate disection and thorascopic mobiisation of\nthe oesophagus without the need for thoracotomy and its associated\ncomplcations. We report our experence of thorascopic-assisted\ntranshiatal oesophagectomy (TATH) between December 1993 and\nJune 1996. Forty-two consecutive patients underwent TATH.\nTwelve patients required conversion to thoracotomy because of\npuonary adhesions, size of tumour, tracheal injuries or ventilation\ndifficulties. The mean age of the patients was 65.7 (45-80) years.\nThe sticture length was between 3-1 Icm in the TATH and 5-12cm\nin the conversion group. average total operation fime was 308\nmiutes (235-400) in the TATH, thoracoscopic dissection taking 83\nminutes (50-120).One death occurred in each group. The men post\noperative hospital stay was 14 days m both groups. The I and 2\nyear wurvival rates were 71% (30 of 42) and 60% (25 of 42)\nrespectively. The results of TATH are very similar to those of\nconventional surgery. We propose that TATH may offer an\nadvantage in terms of visualisation of mediastinal structures during\ndissection, thus minimising operative complications.\nANOTHER VIEW ON LAPAROSCOPIC ANTI- REFLUX SURGERY\nS El Hasani PM Murchan I Chetter B Khan SS Somers\nACJ VHndsor PJ Guilou\nProfessorial Surgical Unit, St James's University Hospital, Leeds\nAims: Measurement of outcome for aparoscopk antireflux\nsurgery (LARS) has to date been confined to the technical\nfeasibilty, its impact on symptomatology and the fnancal\nimplication of its introduction.

PI Reed, MJ Hill, A Watson. UK National Barrett's\nOesophagus Registry, Lady Sobell Gastrointestinal Unit, Wexham\nPark Hospital, Slough, Berkshire, SL2 4HL.\nA UK National Registry of Barrett's Oesophagus (BO) patients\nwas established in June 1996 as a joint initiative between the\nOesophageal Section of the BSG and the European Cancer Prevention\nOrganisation (ECP). Since then over 500 patients have been registered\nfrom the first 3 centres and this communication reports the results of a\npilot study of data from two of these centres in adjoining health\ndistricts. The hospitals were Wexham Park Hospital, Slough (WPH),\ncatchment population 360,000, and Wycombe General Hospital, High\nWycombe (WGH), catchment population 220,000. At WPH the visual\ndiagnosis ofBO was initially made at endoscopy irrespective of length\nof involved segment and confirmed histologically in at least 76%. At\nWGH the diagnosis was only considered in segments of approximately\n4cm or more, but all ofthese had histological confirmation ofBO.\nBetween January 1991 and August 1996, 424 BO cases were\nregistered at WPH. There was a male preponderance of 1.5:1, the\nmean age being 65 years for males and 70 years for females. In the\nperiod July 1995 to June 1996 197 BO patients were endoscoped at\nWPH (M:F 1.7, mean ages 62 and 71 years respectively) and 71 BO\npatients at WGH (M:F 1.7, mean ages 62 and 69 years respectively).\nAdenocarcinoma of the oesophagus was diagnosed at WPH in\n5\/424 (1 in 85) patients between January 1991 - June 1996, of whom\n2 were diagnosed in the period July 1995 - June 1996 and in 1 patient\n(1 in 71) at WGH in the latter period.\nThese data confirm the practicality of running a multicentre BO\nRegistry, establishing comparisons of diagnostic criteria of BO in\ndifferent departments and variations with time.

It is well\ndocumented that the incidence of oeophagel adenocarcinoma is\nrising, and one miht suspect that this is paralleled by an increase in\nthe incidence of Barrett's oesopbagus. We have studied the\nincidence of Barrett's oesophagus in Tayside to determine whether\nthere is an increasing incidence in the diag is of Barrett's\noesophagus.\nThe incidence of endoscopically diagnosed Barrett's oesophagus\nwas determined by searching the endoscopy dataas for years\n1980-1993. This represented 53,433 endoscopies perforned in our\npopulation of 384,000. 961 new cases of endoscopically diagnosed\nBarrett's oesophagus were idendfied rep ing 18 new\ncases\/100,000\/year (18 cases\/l,000 endoscopies). The incidence\nwas not constant throughout, but showed a dramatic rise from\n1\/100,000\/year (1.4\/1,000 endoscopies) in 1980\/81 to\n48\/100,000\/year (42.7\/1,000 endoscopies) in 1992\/93. When only\ncases with histological confirmation were considered, the incidence\nfor 1992\/93 was 18\/100,000\/year (16.5\/1,000 endoscopies).\nWe have demonstrated a significant rise in the incidence of\nBarrett's oesophagus. This may be partially explained by an initial\nlow incidence, possibly due to a failure to recognise Barrett's\noesophagus endoscopically, combined with a change in endoscopic\nreferral patterns (possibly more reflux disease) and\/or an\noverzealous attitude to the endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's\noesophagus. However, we believe there is a true increase in the\nincidence of Barrett's oesophagus in our population. The cause of\nthis increasing incidence is unknown, but it may be related to the\nincreasing incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.\nPREVALENCE OF SPECLALISED COLUMNAR\nEPITHELIUM AT THE CARDIA OF PATIENTS WITH\nGASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX WITHOUT OBVIOUS\nBARRETT'S OESOPHAGUS; COMPARISON WITH NORMAL\nCONTROLS. B.T.Cope, M.A.Cox, J.C.Gearty, Gastroenterology\nUnit, City Hospital, Dudley Road, Birmingham, B18 7QH, UK.\nPreviously unsuspected specialised columnar epithelium (SCE) has\nbeen reported in biopsies of the cardia from 18% of unselected\npatients undergoing endoscopy (1). This may be relevant in the\nincreasing prevalence of adenocarcinoma in the distal oesophagus and\nat the cardia and raises the question whether Barrett's oesophagus is\nmuch commoner than previously thought. In this study, we have\nlooked at the prevalence of SCE at the cardia of 54 consecutive\npatients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). 15 of the\n54 had mild erosive reflux oesophagitis (Savary Miller grades I&2)\nand 13 of the 54 had erythema of the distal oesophagus without\nerosions. The results were compared with 18 normal controls who had\nneither symptoms of GOR nor any endoscopic abnormality of the\nupper GI tract. Patients with more severe endoscopic GORD including\nBarrett's oesophagus were excluded. The 54 GOR patients (33\nfemales) were aged 23-83 mean 56 years and the 18 controls (II\nfemales) were aged 22-75 mean 45 years. At least 3 large endoscopic\nbiopsies were taken from below the squamo-columnar junction at the\ncardia in each patient, stained with haematoxylin\/eosin and alcian\nblue\/PAS diastase and assessed histologically for the presence of SCE\nby one pathologist (JCG) who was unaware of the clinical or\nendoscopic features. 29 (53.7%) of the patients with GOR had SCE at\nthe cardia compared to 4 (22.2%) of the controls (X2=5.38; P<0.02).\nThere was no correlation between SCE at the cardia and age, sex and\nthe presence of reflux oesophagitis at endoscopy. We conclude that\nSCE is relatively common in both groups but is commoner in patients\nwith GOR than controls. However it must be doubtful whether SCE at\nthe cardia has the same significance as Barrett's oesophagus.\n1. Spechler et al.

It has been suggested that Short Segment\nBarrett's oesophagus (SSBO) represents an early, metaplastic phase in\nthe transition from normal to BO. If this is the case, oesophageal acid and\nbile exposure in SSBO should be greater than normal. To examine this\nhypothesis the aim ofthis study is to compare oesophageal acid and bile\nexposure in normal, SSBO and BO patients. Methods: BO is defined as\n.3cm columnarisation of the distal tubular esophagus n =21; SSBO is\ndefined as intestinal metaplasia at an otherwise normal squamocolumnar\njunction, n=19; and normal is defined as no BO or SSBO, n=43. Normal\nand SSBO patients were all symptomatic patients attending for diagnostic\nendoscopy. Ambulatory 24 hour oesophageal pH and bile studies were\nperformed using a Synectics mark III Digitrapper and Bilitec 2000 system,\n10 days after stopping acid suppression therapy. When possible both\nstudies were performed simultaneously and the probes were positioned\nScms above the lower oesophageal sphincter. A positive pH study is\ndefined as a DeMeester score >15 and a positive bile study is defined as a\nbilirubin exposure >5% ofthe supine period.\nResults: Barrett's SSBO Normals\nNo. of+ve pH studies 18\/21* 11\/19 24\/43\nMedian DeMeester score 57.2** 17.9 25.6\nNo. of+vebile studies 11\/16 2\/10 9\/18\nMedian bilirubin exposure 9.45% 0.1% 4.9%\n* p < 0.03 by X2test. ** p < 0.01 by Mann- Whitney U test\nConclusion: Oesophageal acid and bile exposure in SSBO does not\ndiffer from normal but is significantly less than in BO. These results do\nnot support the hypothesis that SSBO is an early step in the progression\nto BO. It is suggested that gastroesophageal reflux is not an aetiological\nfactor for SSBO.\nPATTERN OF EARLY CHROMOSOMAL ALTERATIONS IN\nBARRETT'S OESOPHAGUS.\nCK MacKay. RC Stuart, J Going**, JN Baxter, WN Keith*\n(introduced by JF MacKenzie)\nDepartment ofMedical Oncology*, University ofGlasgow. Depts. of\nSurgery and Pathology**, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow\nBarrett's oesophagus is the major risk factor for oesophageal\nadenocarcinoma. The progression to malignancy involves several\ngenetic events. but little is known about early changes occurring in the\nmetaplastic epithelium before dysplasia develops. Aim: to identify\nchromosomal alterations, consistent with malignant potential in non-\ndysplastic Barrett's mucosa. Method: Multiple endoscopic biopsies were\ntaken from 17 patients with uncomplicated Barrett's oesophagus,\nincluding normal oesophagus and stomach as controls.The frozen biopsies\nwere sectioned, clustered on slides and subjected to interphase\ncytogenetics. Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridisation (FISH) was performed\nwith probes specific to chromosomes 1,8,9,12,17 & 18. Signals per\nnucleus were counted on 200 cells per biopsy,using fluorescent\nmicroscopy. The chromosome index(CI) was calculated (No. of signals\n\/No.of nuclei). The mean CI for controls(n=77) was 1.58 +0.1 and a\nvalue >3 standard deviations from the mean was regarded as abnormal.\nResults:\nChromosome No. biopsies No. patients Chromosomal Changes\n1 24 8 No abnormality\n8 9 4 1 gain (Patient 2)\n9 31 9 2 gains (Patients 2 & 5)\n12 15 6 1 loss (Patient 3)\n17 16 5 No abnormality\n18 33 13 No abnormality\nTotal 128 17 4 alterations\nCondusion: Chromosomal changes occur in uncomplicated Barrett's\noesophagus, at a low frequency, consistent with the hypothesis that\ngenetic alterations are rare in non-dysplastic disease. Clonal divergence,\nreflecting the histological heterogeneity ofBarrett's mucosa, is\nsuggested, as chans do not occur at all biopsy sites in each patient.\nA36\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH145\nTH146\nTH147\nTH148\nAMPLIFICATION AND OVEREXPRESSION OF CYCLIN DI\nIN OESOPHAGEAL CARCINOMA\nR.

Cyclin DI is a\nproto-oncogene, since its aberrant expssion could contrbute to\nuncontrolled cel proliferation. This study investigaed amlificatin and\noverexpression of cyclin DI in oeophageal carCnoma.\nTwenty-six oesophageal adenocarcinonas and 19 cel\ncarcinma were studied. Paird tuowur and noma DNA sampes were\nywsed by Soudtrn blotting with specific DNA probes for cyclin Dl\nand for a control gen (ot-lactalbumin) which is present in a singc copy.\nThc cyclin DI gene copy number was caculated for each tunour.\nExpression of the cyc}in DI gene was asessed by immunohistochenical\nanalysis of its protein product, which is usua undetectable by this\nmedtod in normal tissues.\nCyclin DI gene amplfication (by a factor of between 2 and 6) was\nidentified in 7 tunours (16%); 5 were squamous cel carcinomas, 2 were\nadenocarcinomas. No significant association was identified between\namplification and tumour T stage, N stage, or patient survival.\nOverexpression of cycin Dl protein was identified in 8 tumours (6\nsquamous cell carcinomas and 2 adenocarciomas) and was significantly\nassociated with gene amplification (p=0.04, Fisher's Exact test).\nOverexpression was also significantly associated with eady T stage (Ti\nor T2; p=0.01 Fisher's Exact test). No significant associaton was\nidentified between overexpression and N stage or patient survivaL\nThere was a trend (non-significant) towards a predominance of both\namphification and overexpression of cyclin DI in squamous cell\ncarcinomas over adenocarcinomas.\nThese results indicate that cyclin DI amplfication and overexpression\noccur commonly-in oesophageal carcinoma, particularly squamous cell\ncarcinoma. Cvclin DI overexpression may influence tumour behaviour,\ncausing the disease to present at an earlier T stage. The mechanism for\nthis effect is unclear. and warrants fiuther investigation.\nRISING INCIDENCE OF OESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA:\nA 20 YEAR RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW FROM A SINGLE UNIT\nBJ Johnston, PI Reed, MS Carpani de Kaski, S Levi. Lady Sobell GI\nUnit, Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, Berkshire, SL2 4HL.\nIt is now recognised that the pattern of oesophageal cancer has\nchanged dramatically. A previous report from our unit in 1991\nrevealed that during 1976-1990 49%\/ of all oesophageal cancers were\nadenocarcinomas (AC). The review of endoscopy records has now\nbeen extended to include the next 5 year cohort, 1991-1995 inclusive.\nA total of 37,992 consecutive endoscopy records for the period\n1976-1995 were studied retrospectively for mention of oesophageal\ncancer, 289 cases were identified. They were subdivided by\nhistological type, oesophageal location, sex, age and into four cohorts\nof five years by year of presentation to the unit. The oesophagus was\ndivided into two segments, above and below 32cm, by adapting the\ncriteria suggested by the US National Cancer Institute (1989).\nThe mean age at diagnosis of both male and female patients with\nsquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had increased during the 20 years\nstudy period; in males from 67.4 years in the first, to 74.2 years in the\nlast quartile and in females from 66.4 to 72.8 years during the same\nperiod. In contrast, whereas the age of males with AC had remained\nvirtually unchanged (66.7 to 68.3) in females with AC the age had\ndropped from 74.2 to 69.9 years between the first and last quartiles.\nAC were located predominantly in the lower oesophagus, 132 (83%)\nbelow 32cm and 28 (17%) above 32cm. SCC were more evenly\ndistributed; 48 (43%) below and 62 (57%) above 32cm. In line with\nother published series the numbers of AC had risen from 21 (45%) in\nthe first quartile to 63 (70%h) in the fourth quartile. Overall the\nmale:female sex ratio for AC was 3:1 (M120: F40 cases) and 0.7:1\nfor SCC (M46: F64).\nAC now represents the majority of all oesophageal cancers\ndiagnosed in our unit, especially in males. These findings confirm a\ncontinuing rise in incidence of oesophageal AC to 700\/o, the highest\nincidence reported to date.\nEur J Cancer Prev 1991; 1: 23-25; Cancer 1989; 64: 526-30\n.ADENOC.ARCLNO.M,X OF THE LOWER OESOPHAGUS AND\nCARDIA ARE SIMILAR BOTH EPIDEMIOLOGICALLY\n.AND ('LINICALLY: A POPULATION BASED SILTDY\nFROM 1974 TO 1993.\nD)olan K.

MANIFOLD,N.BOYLE,\nH.TAYLOR, M.MAISEY, AND S.RANKIN.\nINSTITUTION: DEPARTMENTS OF SURGERY AND RADIOLOGY,\nGUY'S AND ST THOMAS'S HOSPITALS, LONDON\nAim: To determine whether PET scanning improves the\naccuracy of pre-operative staging with spiral CT scanning\nof patients with primary oesophageal carcinoma.\nMETHODS: 14 consecutive patients with oesophageal (10 ade\nno, 4 squamous) were studied. 3 were excluded due to\ndistant metastases detected by PET and CT scans. 11\npatients with operable disease were scanned pre-\noperatively by spiral CT and PET scan, using the positron\nemitter 18F fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The findings of\nspiral CT and PET were assessed independently of the\nfindings at operation and pathological examination of the\nresected specimen.\nRESULTS: The primary tumour was visualised in 10 cases by\nspiral CT and in all 11 cases by PET. CT gave anatomic\ninformation of the extent of local spread which would not\nby expected from PET scans. Positive left gastric\/\ncoeliac lymph nodes were found in 7 cases. These were\ndetected in 4 cases on CT (with 1 false positive) and in\nonly 1 case by PET because of the lack of anatomical\ndetail required to separate them from the primary.\nPositive mediastinal nodes were found in 5 cases. These\nwere detected in 3 cases by CT and in 2 of these by PET.\nOne patient had 4 x 0.5cm subcapsular liver metastases.\nThese were detected by PET but not by CT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ability of PET scans to detect disease\ndistant to the operative field suggests its main role may\nbe in patients with large tumours and borderline\noperability. In addition PET may have a role in\npredicting response to neo adjuvant chemotherapy.\nA37\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nEndoscopy TH151-TH163\nTH151TH149\nTHISO TH152\nDOES PRIOR RADIO- AND\/OR CHEMOTHERAPY\nPREDISPOSE TO COMPLICATIONS AFTER INTUBATION\nFOR MALIGNANT OESOPHAGO-GASTRIC OBSTRUCTION\n1Rcu M. van Blankenseus, J.Dees and P.D.Siersemna.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Dijkzigt,\nRotterdam, The Netherlands.\nEndoscopic intubation is an effective procedure for palliation of\ndysphaga in patients with malignant oesophago-gastnc obstruction.\nPrior radio- and\/or chemotherapy may entail an increased risk of\ncomplications following tubation with a rigid prosthmis.\nThe aim of the study was: (1) to assess efficacy, complications,\nrecurrent dysphagia and urvival after intubation for paliation of\ndysphagia, and (2) to evaluate the relationship between prior radio-\nand\/or chenotherapy and the occurrence of complications.\nFrom 1988 to 1995, a consecutive series of 307 patients underwent\nintubation with a Celestin prosthesis under general anaehesia for\npalliation of dysphagia, caused by a mlignant stricture of oesophagus\nand cardia. Of these 307 patients, 111 (36.2%) patients had undergone\nprior radio- and\/or chemotherapy. In 306 (99.7%) patients, a rigid\nprosthesis was succesfidly placed. The dysphagia score improved from\n2.7 \u00b1 0.6 (grading from 0 to 4) at basedi to 0.6 \u00b1 0.8 at 4 weeks after\nintubation. Major complications were registered in 97 (31.7%\/) patients\nand included: perforation (22), fistula (5), haemnorrhage (9), severe pain\n(10), aspiration (8), erosion\/ulcer at the end of prosthesis (7), fever (4),\nmigration (22), malposition (7), and fracture of prosthesis (3). Sixty-\nnine (22.6%) patients had recurrnt dysphagia. Median survival was 67\ndays and hospital stay after placement was 6.6 \u00b1 5.5 days. Prior radio-\nand\/or chemotherapy increased the risk of perforation, fisla,\nhaemorrhage and severe pain following intubation (26\/1 11 vs 20\/195;\np=0.0026). Median survival was not different between patients with or\nwithout prior radio- and\/or chemotherapy.\nIn conclusion: 1. Celestin prostheses are an effective palliative\ntreatment for malignant dysphagia, however they carry a relatively high\nrisk of complications and recurrent dysphagia. 2. Prior radio- and\/or\nchemotherapy predisposes to prosthesis-related complications.\nPATENTS' OW PERCEPTIONS OF ENDOSCOPY UNDER\nTHROAT SPRAY.

D.Sun, B.P. Saunders, J.D. Sanderson. Dept. of\nGastroenterology, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London SE1 9RT.\nAphthous ulcerabon is a wel-recognised feature of number of inflammatory\nbowel diseases but a parficular hallmark of Crohn's disease (CD). At ileo-\ncolonoscopy, the finding of ileal aphthous ulcers is not infrequent. In a\nprevious study, ieal aphthae were demonstrated as the sole finding in 11% of\npatients of patients undergoing ieocobnoscopy for chronic diarrhoea or\nabdominal pain. The significance of these lesions is, however, uncertain.\nWe have therefbre studied the charactenstics of 30 consecutve patients in\nwhom ileal aphthae were demonstrated at ileocoknoscopy. Patients were\naged 23-66 yrs. (median 32.5 yrs.). 19 patients were female. The indicafion for\nileocolonoscopy was assessment of known inflammatory bowel disease (UC\nn=3, CD n=8), chronic diarrhoea (n=10), abdominal pain (n=6) and rectal\nbleeding (n=3). 2 pabents were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAID).\nOf the 19 patents without known inflammatory bowel disea, 17 had\nnormal inflammatory parameters (haemogobin, platelets, ESR and C-eactive\nprotein). 2 patients had a mild rise in ESR, 1 patient had a borderline low B12\nlevel. 4 patents had undergone small bowel banum studies and 2 had had\nlabelled white cell scans. These tests were all normal\nNo obvious morphological difences were noted in aphthous ulcers\ndetected in patients with or wthout IBD or those on NSAID's. Histology of ieal\nbiopsies showed an inflammatory infiltrate in 13 \/ 19 patients. Further\nsectioning revealed inflammation in 2 additional cases. Granulmas were\nabsent in all cases.\nIleal aphthous ulceration may be the only abnormality detected in patients\nundergoing ileocolonoscopy for the investigaton of gut symptoms.\nMorphology, histology, and additional standard investigatons offer no\napparent clues as to the significance of such lesions. Though a smal number\nmay be due to the use of NSAID's, the majority appear likely to represent a\nform of Crohn's disease. Prospective follow-up studies by ilo-coonoscopy\nand immuno-pathology are essential to determine the significance and natural\nhistory of these lesions.\nCOLONOSCOPIC ARGON PLASMA COAGULATION FOR\nBENIGN AND MALIGNANT RECTAL TUMOURS\nJP Watson, S Jowett, K Oppong, CO Record, K Matthewson.\nGastroenterology Unit, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon\nTyne, NE2 4HH\nEndoscopic Nd YAG laser therapy for gastrointestinal tumours\nrequires large capital expenditure, class 4 containment and carries\na risk of perforation. Endoscopic Argon Plasma Coagulation\n(EAPC) is a diathermy based non-contact technique which may\nbe as effective as laser therapy with fewer side effects.\nMethods: All patients with colonic tumours treated by EAPC\nbetween July and Decenber 1996 were studied. After initial\nendoscopic and histological diagnosis, patients received EAPC\nuntil satisfactory debulking of the tumour was achieved. The\nduration of each treatment, power used and patient tolerance were\nrecorded for each session. Symptoms were assessed at each\nendoscopy session.\nResults: 5 males and 3 females (mean age 79.1 \u00b1 7.4 years) with\nrectal adenocarcinoma (5) or rectal villous adenoma (3) were\ntreated. Reasons for non-operability were advanced age, co-\nexistent medical problems or metastatic disease. The power used\nwas 50-99W, with each session lasting a mean of 13.6 \u00b1 6.1\nminutes. Mean sedation requirements were diazemols 10.0 \u00b1 4.6\nmg, in addition to pethidine 50 mg given in 10\/15 treatment\nsessions. Patient tolerance of the procedure was reported as good\nor excellent in all cases. Patients required 1-3 treatment sessions\nduring the study period, with a mean of 4.3 \u00b1 3.1 weeks between\nsessions. The symptoms of rectal bleeding and passage of mucous\nimproved or resolved in 7 of the 8 cases. 1 patient died from\nmetastatic disease during the study. No complications were\nobserved.\nConclusions: EAPC in this group of patients was well tolerated,\nsafe and resulted in useful symptomatic improvement.\nA39\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH157 TH159\nTH158 TH160\nTECHNIQUE, AND LONG TERM OUTCOME OF ENDOSCOPIC\nBALLOON DILATATION FOR PYLORIC STENOSIS.\nCPSwain. Royal Lo1don Hospital, Whitchapel, London El lBB.\nAim: The aim of this study was to review the technique, results and\nlong term outcome of paints with benign pyloric stenosis trd with\nballoon diltio. Patent and Methods: Sixteen patets wer\ntreated over a 7 year period. 15\/16 werc of Asian origin. The mean\nage was 31 (range 20-49). 9\/16 wer Clo test positive, 10\/16 wae\ntaking o rle at prenation and 6\/16 had ben tratd with\ntriple therapy prior to initial endoscopy. Mean follow up of patients\nwas 36 months (range 7-84). 4\/16 had inpatient stays ranging from 2-8\ndays. 16\/16 had e itis and 10\/16 had evidence of active\nduodenal ulceraton at initial adoscopy. All had food in stomach, 3\/16\nhad gastric dilatato at endosopy. All had mid-bulbar stenosis and\nnone had true nAdoscopic pyloric stenosis. The exit was found at 7\no'clock in 7\/16. Techoque: An 18 mm through the scope (IfIS)\nballoon was used to dilat the duodenal stricture. A variety of\ntechniques were needed to open the stenosis sufficiently to pass the\nTTS balloon which is poorly designed for this application. For 14\/16\nscreening was needed. An overtube was passed and a p;ediatric\nendoscope used to place a guide-wire into the 2nd part of the\nduodenum. Tapered and balloon ERCP dilators were used over the\nwire to predilate the stricture prior to the passage of an 18 mm\nballoon. A large channel endoscope was used to pass the balloon. In\n10 cases the balloon was inflated distal to the stricture an then pulled\nthrough and in 6 it was possible to inflate the balloon inside the\nstricture. Result: Eight patients required a single dilatation session,\nfour needed two, three needed three and one patient needed four\ndilataton sessions before an endoscope could reach the second part of\nthe duodenum. There were no perforations or deaths and no patient\nrequired surgery. Yearly endoscopic follow up indicated that the\ndilated stenosis could be crossed with an endoscope, that H Pylori was\neradicated in all, and the symptoms of stenosis were abolished and\nnone had recurrent ulceration at endoscopy. Conclusion: Although\nendoscopic balloon dilatation of pyloric stenosis can be technically\ndemanding the long-term results are excellent.\nFORCES EXERTED BY THE ENDOSCOPIST ON THE\nCOLONOSCOPE DURING COLONOSCOPY. C A Mosse, T N\nMills, DG ldl, C PSwLin. Dearments of Medical Physics,\nUniversity Colege, Ipswich Geneal and Royal Lxndon Hospitals.\nAin: An electronic device was designed and built for use at\ncolonoscopy to allow measurement of the forces exerted by the\nclinician on the endoscope during colonoscopy. Methods: The device\nfeatured a handle designed in the shape of hinged split cylinder which\ncould be locked around the endosc but could be readily moved up\nand down the shaft as the colonoscopy proceeded. The handle\nconsisted of two parts, one that gripped the scope and one that was\ngripped by the colonoscopist. One of the members that'joined these\nparts together contained strain gauges arranged as a Wheatstone bndge\nso that the forces transmitted could be measured accurately. The\ndevice measured and recorded the twisting forces exerted dunng the\nexamination as well as the push and pull applied. A computer stored\nthe data on disk while in real time it displayed the forces graphically\nas two chart recorder style taces. The device was calibrated against\na range of weights exerting force on a colonoscope using a pulley\nsystem and was shown to give reproducible linear measurements over\nthe range of interest. A series of interchangeable split cylinders\nallowed it to be used with any size of colonoscope. It was\nelectronically isolated from the patient. The width of the colonoscopes\nused varied from 11 - 16 mm diameter. Results: This device was used\nto measure the forces at colonoscopy in preliminary studies in 10\npatients. Results: Peak forward force = 4.4 Kg, backward force = -\n1.2 Kg, left torque = 0.35 Kg meters, right torque =0.9 Kg meters.\nPercentage time force greater than 1 Kg = 5%. Peak anal insertion\nforce = 270g.\nConclusions: These measurements represent the first accurate\nmeasurements of the forces exerted during colonoscopy. Methods and\ndevelopments which reduce the force exerted during successful\ncolonoscopy are likely to diminish pain and reduce the risk of\nperforation. A knowledge of these forces may also help with the\ndesign of new instruments and models for teaching or research.\nRANDOMIZED TRIAL OF ORAL SODIUM PHOSPHATZ COMPARED WITH\nORAL SODIUM PICOSULPHATE PREPARATION OF THE COLON FOR\nCOLONOSCOPY. X Yoshioka; J Bates; D Norton; MRB\nKeighley. University Department of Surgery, Queen\nElizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.\nINTRODUCTION: Proper bowel cleansing is essential\nfor colonoscopy. Sodium picosulphate is regarded by\nmany as the standard preparation for endoscopy and\nelective surgery. Some colonoscopic studies suggest\nthat oral sodium phosphate is superior to most other\nagents used for bowel preparation.\nAIN: To compare oral sodium phosphate and oral\nsodium picosulphate in preparation for colonoscopy.\nNETEOD: One hundred and six patients who had\ncolonoscopy were randomly allocated into two groups:\npatients having oral sodium phosphate 45ml twice day\nbefore investigation (n - 51)and those having oral\nsodium picosulphate 2 sachets the day before\ninvestigation (n - 55).\nRESULTS: Linear analogue scale for patient's\nacceptability including abdominal pain, nausea,\nembarrassment, fear and fatigue showed that the score of\nfear was significantly greater in sodium phosphate group\ncompared to sodium picosulphate group (p<0.02). Scoring\nof'the faecal residue in the colon revealed that sodium\nphosphate was more effective in the ascending (p<00S),\ndescending (p<0.01) and whole colon (p<005) compared to\nthe remainder. However, no significant difference was\nfound in the observed area of the mucosa between the two\ngroups.\nCOECLUsION: These results suggest that oral sodium\nphosphate is well tolerated and a satisfactory agent for\npreparation in colonoscopy. In terms of bowel\npreparation sodium phosphate is superior to sodium\npicosulphate.\nTHERAPEUTIC SMALL BOWEL ENDOSCOPY. C P Swain.\nRoyal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London El 1BB\nAim: To asse the indications and outcome of therapeutic small\nbowel endoscopy. Patients & methods: From a series of enterscopic\nexaminations in 207 patients results of therapeutic enteroscopy in 50\ncases were assessed. Most cases were performed without overtube or\nscreening. Indications & results: Blkeding: Angiodysplasiaofjejunum\n14 (6 single, 8 multiple), bleeding diverticulum 1, amyloid 2,\ninoperable malignancy 2. No further bleeding occurred in 8\/14\nangiodysplasia and the diverticulum. Bleeding rate appeared reduced\nfrom the malignancies but not the amyloid cases. Bipolar probe was\nused for 11 and Nd:YAG laser for 8. The laser fiber was easier to\npass through the scope to use at distal sites. In 15% of patients\nreferred for entroscopy for bleeding lesions accessible to the\ngasroscope had been missed and were treated using the enteroscope.\nA bleeding duodenal ulcer, 3 gastric angiomas, linear erosions in\nhiatus henia, 2 Dieulafoy ulcers and 3 watermelon stomachs were\ntreated with bipolar or laser treatment and had no further bleeding.\nPolypectomy. 8 hamartomatous polyps were removed from the small\nbowel and 14 from stomach in 3 patients with Peutz Jeger syndrome.\nA duodenal carcinoid tumour was completely excised. Feedig:\nFeeding tubes were placed beyond the ligament of Treitz in 10 patients\nusing a 0.35 mm, 400 cm guidewire, passing a feeding tube over the\nwire and then rerouting it through the nose. Direct puncture\npercutaneous jejunostomy with radiological assistance was used in 5\npatients with gastric stasis or obstruction.

Posterior\ninvasion may not be apparent on computed tomography (CT) and so\npatients may be subjected to inappropriate laparotomy. Endoscopic\nultrasound (EUS) can clearly visualise the layers of the stomach wall\nand adjacent structures, including regional lymph nodes and so the\nlocoregional staging of gastric tumours can be determined. This\nprocedure can be performed immediately following the initial\ndiagnostic endoscopy.\nTwenty four patients with histologically proven gastric cancer\nunderwent EUS. Eleven patients were deemed to have resectable\ntumours on EUS. This was confirmed at operation. Ten patients were\nfelt to have irresectable tumours using EUS. Of these, five underwent\nlaparotomy and palliative bypass due to extensive tumour invasion.\nFive patients were unfit for surgical intervention or had evidence of\nmetastatic spread.\nCT predicted resectability in 3 irresectable tumours and 5 resectable\ntumours but was valuable in providing information regarding\nmetastatic spread.\nEndoscopic ultrasound is more accurate than CT in predicting\nirresectability of gastric tumours and therefore has a valuable role in\nthe assessment of tumours in patients who would not otherwise\nrequire palliative bypass.\nTOTAL INTRAVENOUS ANAESTHESIA IN PAEDIATRIC GASTRONMESTINAL\nENDOSCOPY\nMLMar.KCJM raall MWhie.HW-M K& _1.

DL\nWingate, FD Castillo, T Nomura, MF Benson, DF Evans. GI Science\nResearch Unit, St Bartholomew's and Royal London School of\nMedicine, London, UK.\nClinical small bowel manometry (SBM) can identify differences\nbetween grous of subjects, but its diagnostic value remains uncertain\nWe used computer-analysed SBM in 47 studies in 18 healthy controls\nto construct a database ofnormal values of20 variables of the\nmigrating motor complex (MMC); the diagnostic potential ofthis\ntechnique was supported by a study of Chagas'.disease in Brazil, in\nwhich 21\/21 patients had > 2 variables outside the normal range. We\nused prolonged SBM as a diagnostic test in 63 UK tertiary referral\npatients with suspected dysmotility. Subjects were studied for 24 hrs\nwith a triple-sensor nasojejunal manometric catheter linked to a digital\ndatalogger; data from the sensor located at the d-j flexure was used to\ncalculate the 20 variables. SBM failed in 6 subjects (10%). Motility\nwas judged to be normal in 17 subjects, with <1 abnormal variable.\nThe remaining 40 patients with >2 abnormal variables (range 2 - 9,\nmedian 4) included all 14 patients with known pathology - diabetic\nneuropathy (5), vagotomy diarrhoea (3), scleroderma (2), enteric\nmyopathy (3), CNS disease (1) - and 4\/4 'irritable bowel' patients with\nrefractory urgent and frequent defaecation. Abnormal records were\nmarked by distortion, and, in 5, by abolition of the normal difference\nbetween diurnal and nocturnal activity. In 7, there was marked\nattenuation or absence of a motor response to food (not all patients\ncould tolerate a normal meal). In 4, there were 'Chagas-like' prolonged\nPhase 3 and slow propagation of the MMC: another 7 had one or other\nof these abnormalities. In contrast, ultra-rapid MMC propagation was\nseen in 3\/5 diabetics, and 2 others with diarrhoea. Low amplitude\ncontractions were seen in 3 (scleroderma 2, dilated bowel 1) but Mi in\npatients with myopathy. 3 had MMCs by day but not at night, and 3\nhad excess MMCs throughout. We suggest that computer-analysed 24-\nhr SBM is an objective and reproducible diagnostic technique; it\nreveals diverse patterns of dysmotility that probably reflect different\npathologies of gut muscle and nerves.\nA41\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)A42\nTH165\nTH166\nTH167\nTH168\nANOV LMETHOD OR 24HOUR PANCOLONIC\nAMBUIATORY MANOMEIRY\nR HaggrI.

The aim of this study was to establish a new\ntechnique and describe colonic motor patterns using 24 hour\nambulatory pancolonic manometry.\nFive healthy volunteers were recruited to the study.\nColonic motlity was measured using two silicon coated\ncatheters(OD-3mm) with 5 pressure transducers at 15cm\nintervals. The proximal catheter was introduced\ntransnasally and it's tip positioned at the splenic flexure\nunder fluoroscopic control. The distal catheter was\nintroduced transanally in an unprepared colon and it's tip\npositioned in the descending colon with the help of a\ncolonoscope. No sedation was used for the colonoscopy. The\ntip of the distal catheter was clipped to the colonic mucosa\nwith a titanium clip. The transducers spanned the bowel\nfrom the terminal ileum to the rectum. Data was recorded\ncontinuously on a portable data logger (MMS Universal\nPortable System). All subjects were fully ambulant and ate\ntheir own meals.\nRecordings were made for a total of 116 hours in 5 subjects.\nThe colon exhibited high amplitude propagating\ncontractions(HAPC), migrating motor complexes(MMC)\nand rectal motor complexes(RMC). Mean number of HAPC\nwas 5.24\/24hrs, 16% occurring within 1 hour of waking and\n28% preceding defecation. Mean number ofMMC was\n11.8\/24hrs, 33.5% of which propagated into the caecum.\nMean number ofRMC was 10.6\/24hrs, 17.8% propagated\naborally and 9.8% propagated orally.\nThe human colon exhibits phasic activity which is\npropagated from the terminal ileum. The rectum shows\ncomplexes which are propagated in an orad as well as\naborad direction.\nGASTRIC ARRHYTHMIAS IN THE FUNCTIONAL BOWEL\nDISORDERS.\nA.C.B. Leahy, C. Clayman, I Mason, K Besherdas, 0. Epstein. Centre\nofGastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital, London NW3 2QG.\nCutaneous electrogastrography (EGG) abnormalties including\narrhthmias and a postprandial power decrease have been described in\nfunctional dyspepsia (FD). EGG arrythmias have been well correlated\nwith antral dysmotility. The aim ofthis study was to substantiate EGG\nabnonnalities in FD, and to compare FD patients with patients\nsuffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: Patients\nstudied incuded 105 with dyspepsia with a normal endpscopy and\nabdominal ultsound scan, 60 with IBS diagnosed by the Rome\ncriteria and 30 healthy controls. Two cutaneous bipolar eectrodes\nwere placed over the stomach and connected to an EGG recording unit\n(Synectics, Stockholm, Sweden). EGG was perfo daccording to a\nstandard protocol which included a 2 hour prelpostprandial study.\nBradygastria was defined as 0-2cpm; normal slow wave activity as 2-\n4cpm; and tachygastria as 4-9cpm. Postprandial power change was\ncalculated. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t-test.\n26 patients had a radiolabeiled gastric emptying study peformed to\ncorrelate EGG abnormalities with gastric emptying. Abnormal EGG\nwas defined as <700\/o normal slow wave activity either preprandially or\npostprandially. Results: A postprandial power decrease was observed\nin 8 controls and this was not considered to be an abnormality when\npresent alone. Two controls had <70@\/o normal slow wave activity\neither preprandially or postprandially. EGG abnormalities were present\nin 32 (30%) FD patients and 6 (10%\/) IBS patients. 35 IBS patients\nalso had dyspepsia, including all 6 patients with abnormal EGG. Mean\n% normal slow wave activity pre\/postprandially were: controls\n86.9\/90.0; FD 81.6\/82.9(p<0.02); IBS 86.6\/88.9. No correlation was\nfound between EGG arrhythmias and delayed gastric emptying.\nCondusions: 1. EGG has a high (93%) diagnostic specificity. 2.\nPostprandial power decrease is observed in healthy controls. 3. 30%b of\nFD patients have abnormal EGG suggesting antral dysmotility. 4. In\nIBS, EGG abnormalities only occur when dyspepsia is present.\nVOLIIIONAL SWALLOWING MODULATES CORTICAL\nSWALLOWING PATHWAYS VIA BRAINSTEM MEDIATED\nINTERACTIONS\nS. Hamdv Q. Aziz, J.C. Rothwell, D.G. Thompson\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, University of Manchester, and the\nInstitute of Neurology, London, UK.\nBackground: Swallowing is an complex process exhibiting both\nexcitatory and inhibitory influences over the muscles of the upper\ndigestive and respiratory tracts. Furthermore, the cortex has an\nimportant role in the initiation and modulation of swallowing and\nrespiration. Despite these observations, the functional interactions\nbetween volitional swallowing and the cortical pathways to human\nswallowing and respiratory musculature are unknown. Aims: To\ndetermine how volitional swallowing interacts with the cortico-fugal\npathways to swallowing and respiratory musculature in man. Methods:.\nSwallowing musculature (Mylohyoid) and respiratory musculature\n(Diaphragm) were studied in 8 healthy volunteers (7 male, age range\n24-32 yrs). Mylohyoid and diaphragm EMG responses to transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation of the cortex were recorded, in maximal\ninspiration, at intervals of: 100 msec between 0-1 sec, 2 sec and 5 sec,\nafter a Sml water bolus swallow or a control task (hand contraction).\nResults: When compared to the control task, swallowing facilitated the\nmylohyoid responses between 0 and 0.4 sec (swallowing: 670\u00b121V,\ncontrol: 565\u00b136pV, p<0.02) before inhibiting them between 0.6 and 2\nsec (swallowing:460\u00b120izV, control: 637\u00b1261&V, p<0.01). In contrast,\nthe diaphragm responses were consistently inhibited from 0.4 sec\nonwards (swallowing: 150\u00b11 11V, control: 187\u00b1101V, p<0.05).\nConclusions: Volitional swallowing modulates the cortical pathways to\nhuman swallowing and respiratory musculature, via excitatory and\ninhibitory influences, a finding that reflects processing by the brainstem\nswallowing centre.\nHISTOLOGICAL PHENOTYPINGOF ENTERICSMOOTH\nMUSCLEDISEASECAUSINGIJUNCTIONAIUNTESTINAL\nOBSTRUCTION IN CHILDHOOD\nSmith V and Milla PJ\nHistopathology. Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children,\nGreat Onrond Steet, London WCIN 3JH, UK\nFunctional inesinal obsuctio or chronic idiic in l\npseudo-obstruction is due to defects either in the enteric\ninnervation or in the smooth muscle.\nWe have stde full-thickness intestinal samples from 27\npatients with fnctional intinal obsruction due to enteric\nsmooth muscle disease, usig rotine histology, electron\nmicroscopy, histochemical and imhemical techniques\nto detect changes in the in l smooth muscle.\nTwo patients presing at the age of 6 months and 18 months\nhad an acquired intesnal myopethy as a result of an autoimmune\nprocess. In 25 the disorders were congenital, and of tese 7 had\nsegmental abnmlities limited to the rectm and distal colon and\n18 a diffuse disease affecting both the small ad large bowel. We\nidentified five apparent histological pLnotpes of enteric muscle\ndisease. Three of these represent abormalibes in morphogenis\nresulting in alterations in intestinal muscle layering. Two\nprobably exemplify intrinsic myocyte defects or changes in the\nextracellular matrix.\nPhenotyping these patients carefully is important both in\ndevising optimal treatment and in un g the nderlying\ndefect. Recognition of the autoimmune smooth muscle disease is\nhelpful, since making the diagnosis influences the paient's\nmanagement. The histological pheotype alludes to probable\naetiology thus allowing investigaion of the possible molecular\nand genetic defects.\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH169\nTH170\nTH171\nTH172\nINTERSTITLAL CELIS OF CAJAL (ICC) INTHE\nHUMAN COLON: REGIONAL DENSIrY\nVARIATIONS\nR Haggas. C Finlayson*. S Gharaie$. and D Kumar.\nDept. of Surgery and Dept. of Histopathology*, St.\nGeorge's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.\nTo determine the regional variation of density of ICC in\nthe wall of the normal human colon, we have studied 109\ncolonic tissue blocks.\nICC were identified in the colon by\nimmunohistochemical staining, using a rabbit\npolyclonal anti-c-kit antibody (Oncogene Science).\nNormal colonic tissue was defined as non-involved tissue\nobtained at surgical resection for a non-obstructing\ncarcinoma of the colon. The regions of interest were\nright, transverse and left colon. Density of ICC was\ngraded on the basis of the number of ICC per high power\nfield. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-\nsquared tests.\nIn the myenteric plexus the transverse colon (p=0.009)\nand right colon (p=0.05) had a significantly higher\ndensity of ICC than the left colon. Although not\nstatistically significant, there was a trend for the density\nof ICC to be higher in the transverse colon than the right\ncolon in the myenteric plexus. In the circular muscle\nlayer, the right colon had the highest density of ICC, this\nwas significant in comparison to the left colon (P=0.02)\nbut not the transverse colon. No significant regional\nvariations in ICC density were identified in the\nlongitudinal muscle layer.\nRegional variations in the density of ICC are present in\nthe colon. The highest density of ICC in the myenteric\nplexus was observed in the transverse colon, the proposed\nsite of pacemaker activity.\nGENDER DIFFERENCES ANDREPRODUCIEIITlY OFWHOLE\nGUT VISCERAL SENSITIVITY. CYF\u00a3ncis, LA Houghton, PJ\nWhorwell. Dept of Medicine, University Hospital of South Manchester.\nAbnormalities in gut visceral sensation are currently regarded as being\nimportant in the pathophysiology of functional bowel disorders.\nHowever, its inter-subject variation, its reproducibility (or intra-subject\nvariation) and the effect of gender on these parameters has received little\nattention. Repeat studies on 8 healthy female (aged 20-37 yrs; median\n23 yrs) and 10 healthy male (aged 20-57 yrs; median 22 yrs) volunteers\nwere carried out to assess the sensory responses of the oesophagus 10),\nduodenum [DI, jejunum (JI, ileum X1L, colon ICI and rectum [RI to\nisovolumic balloon distension. The order in which these regions were\ndistended was randomised, and there were 3 to 47 weeks (median 9\nweeks) between studies.\nResults Female subjects tended to be more sensitive than male subjects\nto distension of the 0 [vol to discomfort (ml): females 15 (7.5-20)\ngeometric mean (range) v males 24 (10-110); p=0. 16], D [73 (40-110)\nv 99 (50-150); p=0.08], J [58 (40-70) v 70 (30-170); p=0.32], 1\n[55(30-100) v 92 (40-150); p=0.029], C [177 (110-280) v 235 (150-\n500); p=0.23] and R [191 (100-400) v 211 (150-325); p=0.58].\nFurthermore, it can be seen from the above ranges that the inter- (or\nbetween-) female variation was less than the inter-male variation; this\ndifference reaching significance in the 0 (p=0.05) and J (p=0.0015).\nHowever, the intra- (or within-) female variation was not apparently\ndifferent from the intra-male variation in the 0 [difference from 1st to\n2nd study: 2.5 (0-7.5) median (range) v 5 (040)], D [10 (0-30) v 20 (0-\n50)], J [20 (20(0-30) v 30 (0-90)], 1 [40 (10-40) v 10 (0-70)], C [40 (10-\n140) v 60 (20-220)] and R [70 (0-125) v 65 (0-125)]. These male-female\ndifferences were not related to differences in anxiety between the female\n[HAD score, 4.5 (0-8) median (range)] and male [5.0 (3-9); p=0.41]\nvolunteers.\nConclusion Because males are less sensitive and have a wider inter-\nsubject variation than females, they may be less prone to abnormalities\nin visceral sensation following exposure to noxious stimuli. This might\nhelp to explain the preponderance of female to male patients with\nfunctional bowel disorders.\nTACHYODDIA INDEPENDENT FROM THE DUODENAL\nMIGRATING MOTOR COMPLEX MAY BE A PART OF\nSPHINCTER OF ODDI DYSFUNCTION. EA Stoner CC Ainley,\nDF Evans, V Kulhalli, AJK Piotrowicz. St. Bartholomew's and the\nRoyal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London..\nManometric measurements of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) have\nenabled a better understanding of its physiology and recognition of the\ncondition of sphincter ofoddi dysfunction (SOD). Presently SOD is\nonly reliably diagnosed by an elevated basal pressure. Previously SO\nphasic activity has been shown to closely follow the migrating motor\ncomplexes(MMCs) with maximal frequency during phase 3 of the\nMMC. A raised frequency of contractions (>8cpm) has been termed as\ntachyoddia however it is not regarded as clinically significant.\nAims I)To determine the incidence oftachyoddia.2) To look at the\nrelationship between tachyoddia, duodenal activity. and SOD\nMethods SOM was performed using a triple lumen catheter\nWilson-Cook, USA), the central channel being continually aspirated. A\nstation pull through technique was employed. The duodenal motility\nwas measured using a single lumen 5 French catheter taped to the\noutside of the duodenoscope.\nResults 65 patients with post cholecystectomy pain, idiopathic\npancreatitis or biliary pain underwent SOM. 15 of the 65 (23%)\np tients had at least one episode of tachyoddia.\nTachyoddia Tachyoddia\nBasal synchronous independent Total\npressure with MMC ofMMC\nRaised 1 4 5\nNormal 9 1 10\nTotal 10 5 15\nA raised basal SO pressure is significantly associated with independent\ntachyoddia ( Fisher's exact test p< 0.05.)\nConclusion. The SO may have its own pacemaker which is\ndissociated from the control of the MMC in patients with SOD.\nTachyoddia independent of the MMC should now be regarded as part\nof sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\nGASTRIC EMPTYING (GE) AND GASTROINTESTINAL\nREGULATORY PEPTIDES (GRP) IN CHILDREN WITH\nRECURRENT EPIGASTRIC PAIN (REP)\nA Papadopoulou. A Vazeou, E Kitsiou',A Papadimitriou2, C Bartsocas\n\" P & A Kyriakou\" Children's Hospital,' Laiko\" Hospital, and\n2'Nevy's\" Hospital, Athens, Greece\nRecurrent epigastric pain is often of uncertain aetiology and it is\ntherefore attributed to psychological causes. Gastrointestinal motility\ndisorders have been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal pain\nand regulatory enteropeptides, in the pathogenesis of intestinal\ndysmotility. However, the incidence of gastric dysmnotility and the role\nofGRP in children with REP are poorly defined. We therefore, carried\nout a prospective study in 36 children (mean age 10.4 years, 18 males)\nwith REP of uncertain aetiology, in order to detect the incidence of\ngastric dysmotility and the role of serum motilin. In 28 patients, REP\nwere associated with non-ulcer dyspepsia: early satiety, postprandial\nabdominal bloating and\/or distention. In 8, REP was paroxysmal,\nprecipitated by prolonged fasting. Seventeen patients (47\"!%) were\nfound to have abnonnal gastric emptying assessed by gastric\nscintigraphic studies : 12 (43 %) of the 28 patients with dyspepsia\n(mean age 9.4 yrs) were found to have delayed emptying of a solid\nmeal (mean T,,2 of 50% of 9mTC-phytate in stomach was 147.2\nminutes); 5 of the 8 (62 %) patients with paroxysmal pain (mean age\n13.4 yrs) had rapid gastric emptying (mean T,,2 of 50%\/. of '9MTC-\nphytate in stomach was 55 minutes). Fasting serum motilin\nconcentrations were lower in the patients with REP compared with 26\nhealthy controls (p<0.00001). However, no significant correlations were\nfound between serum motilin concentrations and the duration or the\nseverity ofREP or gastric emptying time. The treatnt with cisapride\nand\/or erythromycin was associated with resolution of symptoms in all\nof the patients with delayed gastric emptying. Similarly, dietary\nmodifications were associated with a relief in symptoms in children\nwith rapid gastric emptying. In conclusion, GE abnormalities are\ncommon in children with REP of uncertain aetiology. The role of GRP\nin children with REP should be further investigated.\nA43\nGut 1997; 40 (suppl 1)\nTH173 TH175\nTH174 TH176\nTHE USE OF RADIOTRANSMITTING CAPSULES TO MEASURE\nINTE INAL TRANSIT Sl 1wis and KW Heaton. Depanment of\nMedicine, Bristol Royal Ifmary, Bristol BS2 8HW.\nBecause luminal pH increases as the duodenum is entered then falls on\nentry into the caecum, the pH radiotanamittng capsule can be used to\nmeasure small bowel transit-time. It can also be used to measure whole-\ngut transit-time (WGIT) and, by subtraction colonic transit-time.\nHowever the latter is a valid exercise only ifWGIT is not itself altered by\nthe capsule.\nWe set out to see if WGTr measured by the pH radiotransmiting\ncapsules differed from WGfT measured simultaneously using the\ntraditional barium imprepated plastic pellet methodL\n13 healthy volunteers had their WGIT measured using plastic marker\npellets of different shapes, then coilecting two stool samples and x-raying\nthem. At the same time a pH radiotansmitting capsule was swallowed\nand tracked. These measurements were then repeated with the volunteers\ntaking in order wheat bran, senna then loperamide in maximally tolemted\namounts.\nNo significant differences were seen between the two sets of\nmeasurements on baseline diet or if the intestinal tansit was altered using\nwheat bran, senna or loperamide.\nMedian WGTI7 (h) and lerange i h tic p a a capule\nn Peiets Capsule 95% CI\nBaseline 37 63 43, 73 55 36, 76 -3, 10\nWheatbran 13 39 32, 76 42 31, 58 -4, 22\nSenna 13 41 31, 50 42 36, 57 -16,4\nLoperamide 11 74 61, 97 78 67, 113 -22, 18\nWe found no systematic difference in measured WG1T between results\nwith the traditional plastic marker pellets and with the pH\nradiotransmitting capsule.

In addition the pH radiotransmitting capsule gives\ninformation on small bowel transit and caecal anal transit-times, thus\nnegating the need to use separate techniques for each or the use of\nradioactive isotopes. This pH radiotransmitting capsules may be a useful\nmethod of assessing small and large intestinal transit-times.\nALOSETRON SWWS COLONIC TRANSIT IN PAlTS WlTH\nRITA3IZ DOWEL SYNDROME (13) 1M 1.w LA loughton, PJ\nWhorwell.

Dept of Medicine, University Hospital of South Manchester.\n3-5% ofpatients taking the 5HTI, agonist sumatripan (S) for migraine\nexperience chest discomfort, potentially suggesting a cardiac origin.\nHowever, we have recently suggested that the oesophagus may be the\ncause of this chest discomfort, as a supratherapeutic dose ofS (16mg, sc)\nsignificantly alters oesophageal motility without affecting the ECG. The\naim of this study was to investigate whether a therapeutic dose of S\n(6mg, sc) also affects oesophageal motility. Lower oesophageal sphincter\n(LOS), oesophageal body (4 sites), gastric and pharyngeal (to monitor\nswallows) pressures were recorded using a perfused manometric catheter\nwith sleeve sensor in 16 healthy volunteers (aged 19-32 yrs; 9 male)\nbefore and after administration of S or saline control. Sequences of 6\nconsecutive 5ml water swallows with a minimum interval of 20 soc\nbetween each swallow, were carried out -15, -5, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 80,\n100, 120, 150 and 180 min post-injection. Treament order was\nrandomised and double-blind; throughout the study ECG and symptoms\nwere monitored. milts S significantly increased the amplitude of\noesophagealcontractions (mean increasefrompre-injection: S4.SmmHg,\nplacebo -4.SmmHg; difference 9.3mmHg, 95%CI 4.1-14.SmmHg,\np=0.002); an effect that was maintned throughout the whole of the 3\nhr recording period. In addition, S induced a transient increase in LOS\npressure immediately after injection (S 10.9mmHg, placebo 5.lmmHg;\ndifference 5.8mmHg, -0.7-12.3mmHg), although it had no overall effect\non LOS pressure over the time period studied (S 1.9mmHg, placebo\n2. lmmHg; difference 0.2mmHg, -3.9-4.2mmHg). S, however, did not\naffect the duration (S 0.3s, placebo -0. ls; difference 0.4s, 0.2-0.5s) or\nvelocity of propagation (S -0.09 cm\/s, plaebo -0.12cm\/s; difference\n0.03 cm\/s, -0.15-0.21 cm\/s) of oesophageal conons. Chest\ndiscomfort was only experienced in one subject and although this subject\ndid show a change in oesophageal motility, there was noColaon with\nthe degree of change. No subject exhibited any ECG abnormalities.\nConclusion At therapeutic doses S also has an effect onoesophageal\nmotor function, and this provides further evidence of a possible\noesophageal cause of S-induced chest symptoms.\nGASTRIC EMPTYING IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS\n(HIV) INFECTED INDIVIDUALS: RELATIONSHIP TO SYMPTOMS,\nAUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND GASTROINTESTINAL (GI)\nPATHOGENS. PJ Neild. R Jewkes, BG Gazzard. Chelsea and\nWestminster Hospital, London, U.K.\nSymptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying are common in\nHlVseropositive (HIV+) individuals, as is autonomic neuropathy, though\noften subclinical. We tested the hypothesis that GI symptoms may be\nrelated to objective delay in gastric emptying and that this mav be\nassociated with autonomic dysfunction and\/or the presence of\nopportunistic G1 pathogens. Methods: 19 HIV+ subjects with enteric\ninfections (HIV\/P) and 37 HIV+ subjects with no identifiable pathogens\n(HIV\/NP) were compared with 12 presumed HIV-ve healthy controls\n(cont). Subjects completed a symptom score and underwent a series of\nautonomic function tests (aft), and a scintigraphic solid gastric emptying\ntest, using a single headed gamma camera with anterior and posterior\nviews. Results:. Gastric half emptying time (ti\/2) was increased in HIV+\nsubjects and significantly so in those with GI pathogens, though lag\nphase (th.) and the proximal emptying component (pt1\/2\/ t1\/2) were less\naffected. GI symptoms and autonomic dysfunction were significantly\nincreased in HIV+ subjects compared with controls but did not correlate\nwith gastric em ing(r2=0.02l and 0.012 respectively). t,2 was related\nto CD4 count (r1=0.13, lsO.06)and .21,p0.0004).\nresults exp as mesSEM coat K INP HIV+\/P\nsymptom scoreXIS 0.08*0.08 5.54*0.63** 6.9*0.86**\nSD ofR-R intevals (SDRR) (m) 661.56i4.12 39.95*3.8' 33.29*4.3 1\ngstric t,2(min.) 66.95. 16 92.38*8.04A 158.3*20.9**\nt,.,(min.) 22.03*f3.54 29.08*3.02 48.5*9.42\npti,21 t4, 10.75*0.05 0.63*0.03 0.60*0.03\n'p<0.05, *p<0.01, **p<0.001 wrt cont.

Delay may result from local production of cytokines,\neg tumour necrosis factor alpha, or duodenal dysmotility causing reflex\ninhibition of emptying.\nA44\n"}
