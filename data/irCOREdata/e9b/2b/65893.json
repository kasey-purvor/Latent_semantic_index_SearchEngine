The haloes in turn form from the non-linear\ncollapse of initially small density perturbations that were\nimprinted by quantum fluctuations before inflation. When\nthe virial temperature of the halo is high enough the gas\ncan cool radiatively (Rees & Ostriker (1977); White & Rees\n(1978)) and may become self-gravitating. Some fraction of\nthe cooling gas can form stars, which then affect the baryon\ndistribution and star formation rate through feedback; for\nexample from supernova (SN) explosions (e.g. Dekel & Silk\n(1986)).\nSimulating the growth of dark matter haloes from ini-\ntially small cosmological density perturbations has become\nroutine to the extent that even the complex non-linear stage\ncan be predicted with relative confidence (e.g. Springel et al\n(2005)). However, following the behaviour of the baryons un-\ntil stars form is much more demanding for two main reasons.\nFirstly, the physical processes that lead to star formation are\nstill relatively poorly understood, even in the Milky Way\n(MW). Stars are thought to form in molecular clouds in a\ncomplex interstellar medium (ISM) in which magnetic fields\n\u22c6 E-mail: c.m.booth@durham.ac.uk (CMB)\n(Safier, McKee & Stahler (1997)), cosmic rays, turbulence\n(Krumholz & McKee (2005)), relativistic jets (Klamer et al\n(2004)), molecules, dust, and radiative transfer may all play\nsome role. Secondly, the physical scales on which star forma-\ntion takes place is vastly different from those of cosmological\ninterest. Therefore, simulations on a sufficiently large scale\nto sample cosmological structures cannot presently also re-\nsolve physics on the scales relevant for star formation. For\nthese two reasons simulations invariably include \u2018sub-grid\u2019\nphysics that model the complexity of star formation in the\ninterstellar medium using simple rules.\nIn the first generation of hydrodynamic mod-\nels for galaxy formation (Navarro & White (1993);\nSteinmetz & Muller (1994); Cen & Ostriker (1992);\nKatz, Weinberg & Hernquist (1996)), the gaseous com-\nponent of galaxies is modelled as a single fluid. Because\nthe spatial and mass resolution in these simulations is\ninsufficient to resolve star formation they rely upon a\nsimple star formation prescription. In its simplest form this\nconsists of devising criteria by which simulated gas can\nbe flagged as eligible to form stars and then converting\nthe gas to stars by hand (see e.g. Kay et al. (2002) for a\ncomparison of such criteria). Feedback from core collapse\n(type II) SNe, modelled as an extra source of thermal or\nkinetic energy, was found to have little effect in the early\n2 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nmodels. This is because the gas in the surroundings of star\nformation sites is at high density and so is very efficient at\njust radiating away the added energy. As a consequence, too\nmuch gas cooled in dense knots, producing galaxies much\nmore concentrated than those observed (Navarro & Benz\n(1991); Weil, Eke & Efstathiou (1998)).\nThe ISM in observed galaxies is much more complex\nthan the single phase medium present in these early sim-\nulations. Although observed galaxies may have comparable\nmean gas density to the simulated ones, the real ISM consists\nof very dense cold clouds with small volume filling factor,\nembedded in a much more tenuous low-density, hot medium\nwith a \u2018warm\u2019 phase at the interface. SN explosions in the\ntenuous medium have a much greater impact on the galaxy\nbecause this medium cools much less efficiently than gas at\nthe mean density. Throughout this work we will use the la-\nbel \u2018cold\u2019 to describe the molecular clouds in the ISM; and\nthe labels \u2018warm\u2019 and \u2018hot\u2019 to describe the properties of the\nambient gas phase at temperatures of approximately 104K\nand 106K respectively.\nIn response to these problems with the simplest star\nformation and feedback criteria several authors have intro-\nduced \u2018multiphase\u2019 models for star formation in which the\nISM is treated as a number of distinct phases. These schemes\ntake various forms including modification of the simulation\nalgorithm (Ritchie & Thomas (2001); Croft et al (2000);\nScannapieco et al (2006)), treating the multiphase medium\nimplicitly by formulating differential equations that model\nthe interactions between the phases (Yepes et al. (1997);\nSpringel & Hernquist (2003); Okamoto et al (2005)), explic-\nitly decoupling supernova heated gas from its surroundings\n(Stinson et al (2006)), or by decoupling the cold molecu-\nlar phase from the hot phase by one of a variety of meth-\nods, including \u2018sticky particles\u2019 (Semelin & Combes (2002);\nHarfst, Theis & Hensler (2006)) or removing \u2018cold\u2019 parti-\ncles from the SPH calculation (Hultman & Pharasyn (1999);\nPearce et al (1999, 2001); Marri & White (2003)). The de-\ncoupling of the hot and cold ISM phases allows thermal heat-\ning from SN feedback to become more efficient (due to the\nmuch lower density of the hot phase) and also allows one to\nfollow the properties of the cold molecular phase of the ISM.\nThis paper describes an attempt to mimic the mul-\ntiphase medium in a star forming galaxy. Since stars are\nknown to form in molecular clouds our method focuses on\nsimple rules for cloud formation. The star formation recipe\nthen simply converts the most massive of these clouds, \u2018Gi-\nant Molecular Clouds\u2019 (GMCs), into stars with an imposed\nefficiency taken from MW observations. Once a GMC forms\nstars stellar feedback destroys the cloud. We do not attempt\nto model the clouds themselves using hydrodynamics, be-\ncause our current galaxy formation simulations lack by some\nmargin the dynamic range to resolve the Jeans mass (MJ )\nin the cold, dense gas that makes up the clouds. We can\ndemonstrate this lack of resolution by considering theoreti-\ncal models of the ISM (e.g. Wolfire et al (1995)), who calcu-\nlated the thermal equilibrium gas properties of a diffuse ISM.\nWolfire et al (1995) found that a stable two phase medium\nwas produced, with a transition from hot material at den-\nsities < 10\u22120.5cm\u22123 to cold, molecular material at densities\n> 101.5cm\u22123. The Jeans mass of the warm (T = 104K)\nphase is approximately 1\u00d7 108M\u2299, whereas the Jeans mass\nof the cold molecular gas (T = 100K) is \u223c 2000M\u2299. Typical\ncosmological galaxy simulations currently have mass resolu-\ntions no better than 106M\u2299 (Okamoto et al (2005)), many\norders of magnitude away from being able to resolve the\nrelevant scales for accurate tracking of the cold molecular\nphase. Note that these simulations do however resolve MJ\nin the warm phase. Given this limitation, we are forced to\ninstead introduce another particle type in our simulations,\ncalled a \u2018sticky particle\u2019, to represent the clouds. These move\nas ballistic particles through the ambient medium, yet when\nthey encounter another sticky particle interact inelastically\nbased on a set of collision rules that mimic the coagulation of\nclouds. Sticky particles have been used before for similar rea-\nsons by e.g. Lin & Pringle (1976); Jenkins & Binney (1994)\nand Semelin & Combes (2002), and seem to have been intro-\nduced originally by Larson (1978) and Levinson & Roberts\n(1981). We show below that our imposed collision rules pro-\nduce cloud statistics that are similar to those determined in\nnearby galaxies, for which they can be measured.\nWe begin by giving a brief overview of the current the-\nory of the ISM and the formation of clouds, on which our\nrecipes are based (section 2). We then introduce the physics\nwe model with the sticky particle prescription (section 3),\nand constrain all of the free parameters in the model (section\n4). We then present results from simple isolated galaxy sim-\nulations (section 5) and investigate the effects of changing\nthe physics in the sticky particle model (section 5.3). Sec-\ntion 6 contains conclusions and details of future work. The\nISM is a complicated system and the nomenclature used\nto describe it is correspondingly complex. For this reason\nappendix A contains a list of symbols and their associated\nmeanings. Readers not interested in numerical details can\nread the summary of the model in section 3 and then di-\nrectly proceed to the analysis of the properties of the simu-\nlated galaxies presented in section 5.\n2 STAR FORMATION IN DISK GALAXIES\n2.1 The interstellar medium in disk galaxies\nAccording to the models of McKee & Ostriker (1977) (here-\nafter MO77; see also Efstathiou (2000); Monaco (2004);\nKrumholz & McKee (2005)) the ISM of the MW consists of\nat least three separate and distinct gas phases: a hot tenuous\nmedium at a temperature of \u223c 106K; cold, dense molecular\nclouds at a temperature of 6 100K and a warm medium\nthat exists at the boundaries between clouds and the hot\nmedium with T \u223c 104K. In the MW, the hot medium has\na filling factor of 70\u201380% and the cold clouds account for\na few percent of the volume (MO77). Different techniques\nare used to observe these different phases, with radio ob-\nservations probing roto-vibrational transitions of molecules\n(mainly CO), the 21-cm line probing atomic hydrogen, and\nUV- and X-ray observations probing the hot phase, see e.g.\nBinney & Merrifield (1998) for an overview and further ref-\nerences. The fact that different techniques are used to ob-\nserve the different gas phases might exaggerate the degree\nto which these phases are really distinct.\nObservations of star formation in the MW show that\nmost stars form in groups, either as gravitationally bound\nclusters or unbound associations, in the most massive of\nthe molecular clouds (Giant Molecular Clouds, hereafter\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 3\nGMCs), with masses \u223c 106M\u2299, and sizes of order 30-\n50pc, see e.g. Blitz & Thaddeus (1980) and Lada & Lada\n(2003) for recent reviews. The relatively small sizes of\nGMCs currently limit detailed observations of such clouds\nto nearby galaxies, with recent surveys done in the MW\n(Solomon et al (1987); Heyer, Carpenter & Snell (2001)),\nM33 (Rosolowsky & Blitz (2004)) and the LMC (Fukui et al\n(2001)).\nBlitz et al (2006) present detailed observations of\nGMCs in five local galaxies. GMCs are excellent tracers of\nspiral structure to the extent that they are often used to\ndefine the location of arms, in a similar way as, for exam-\nple, HII regions or massive stars are. There is a good corre-\nlation between the locations of GMCs and filaments of HI,\nalthough HI is often observed without accompanying molec-\nular clouds, suggesting that the clouds form from HI.\nObservations in more distant galaxies are currently lim-\nited to measuring the mean surface density of molecular gas\nwith more detailed observations awaiting new instruments\nsuch as ALMA1. According to Young & Scoville (1991), the\nfraction of gas in the molecular phase depends on Hubble\ntype, with early-type spirals tending to be predominantly\nmolecular and late-types atomic. Optically barred spirals\nshow a clear enhancement of CO emission along the bar.\nThis suggests that the large-scale structure of the galaxy\naffects the formation of clouds and hence, presumably, also\nthe star formation rate. A physical implementation of star\nformation should therefore aim to track the formation and\nevolution of molecular clouds. But how do GMCs form?\n2.2 The formation of molecular clouds\nAlthough the early models by Field, Goldsmith & Habing\n(1969) assumed that the different phases of the ISM were in\npressure equilibrium, modern observations paint a picture\nof a much more complex and dynamic situation in which\nthe ISM is shaped by turbulence, possibly powered by SNe\nand the large-scale dynamics of the galactic disk itself, see\ne.g. Burkert (2006) for a recent review. A galaxy-wide effect\nseems to be required to explain the observed Hubble-type\ndependence of cloud properties.\nYet how GMCs form in this complex environment is\nnot well understood (Blitz & Rosolowsky (2004)). Some\nauthors have suggested that GMCs form by the coag-\nulation of preexisting molecular clouds (Kwan & Valdez\n(1983); Oort (1954)) while others have argued that\nGMCs form primarily from atomic gas through insta-\nbility or large-scale shocks (Blitz & Shu (1980)). A vi-\nable mechanism by which this could occur is the forma-\ntion of convergent flows induced by a passing spiral arm\n(Ballesteros-Paredes Va\u00b4zquez-Semadeni & Sclo (1999)). Of\ncourse, both modes of formation may occur: in high density\nregions, where the vast majority of hydrogen is molecular it\nseems likely that molecular clouds form from the coagula-\ntion of smaller clouds, whereas in the outskirts of galaxies\nwhere the gas is predominantly atomic the compression of\ngas in spiral density shock waves provides a more plausible\nformation mechanism.\n1 http:\/\/www.alma.nrao.edu\/\nObservationally, star formation in disks seems to oc-\ncur only above a given surface-density threshold (Kennicutt\n(1989)), with star formation dropping abruptly below the\nthreshold even though the gaseous disk may extend far\nbeyond it. Schaye (2004) describes a model in which this\nthreshold arises naturally due to the thermal instability\nwhen gas cools from 104K to the cold phase (\u223c 100K),\nrendering the disk gravitationally unstable on a range of\nscales. This suggests that a combination of thermal instabil-\nity and large-scale dynamics may be responsible for deter-\nmining when and where GMCs form.\nElmegreen (2000) discusses observational evidence that\nGMCs are in fact short lived entities that form, make stars\nand disperse again on their dynamical time scale. This\nshort time-scale alleviates the need for an internal energy\nsource to sustain the observed internal supersonic turbu-\nlence, something that had puzzled astronomers for a long\ntime. Pringle, Allen & Lubow (2001) discuss this assump-\ntion in more detail and suggest that GMCs form from ag-\nglomeration of the dense phase of the ISM, already in molec-\nular form, when compressed in a spiral shock. They envisage\nthe pre-existing molecular gas to be in dense \u2018wisps\u2019, in the\ninter arm regions, formed from atomic gas by shocks, as\nsimulated by Koyama & Inutsuka (2000).\nRecent numerical simulations support the view that\nwhen clumpy gas is overrun by a density wave it produces\nstructures that resemble GMCs. Wada, Meurer & Norman\n(2002) present high-resolution two-dimensional simulations\nof the evolution of perturbations in a cooling, self-gravitating\ndisk in differential rotation. They show that the disk devel-\nops stationary turbulence, even without any stellar feedback.\nBonnell et al (2006) and Dobbs & Bonnell (2006) performed\nthree dimensional simulations of the passage of clumpy cold\ngas through a spiral shock. Their simulations produce dense\nclouds, with large internal velocity dispersion, reminiscent\nof the \u2018supersonic turbulence\u2019 seen in GMCs. They note\nthat the velocity dispersion is generated on all scales si-\nmultaneously, in contrast to what is usually meant by tur-\nbulence where energy cascades from large to small scales.\nMac Low & Klessen (2004) review the current state of the\nart in simulations and models of GMC formation, including\nreferences to more recent work. In this picture of clouds,\nGMCs are temporary structures formed and dissolving in\nconverging flows. They do not require an internal source of\nenergy, are not in virial or pressure equilibrium and need\nnot even be gravitationally bound. They point out that the\nrelative contribution of galactic rotation and stellar sources\nto driving the observed turbulence is not clear.\n2.3 Star formation in molecular clouds\nIn the older picture of cloud formation, GMCs were long-\nlived, gravitationally bound, virialised objects. The presence\nof supersonic turbulence ensures that clouds do not imme-\ndiately collapse to form stars, as this would predict a star\nformation rate for the MW which is far higher than ob-\nserved. Locally unstable clumps collapse to form proto-stars,\nwhich built-up their mass to produce the initial mass func-\ntion (IMF) through competitive accretion (e.g. Bonnell et al\n(1997)).\nHowever, simulations show that the energy contained\nin supersonic motions is quickly dissipated even in the pres-\n4 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nence of magnetic fields (see references in Mac Low & Klessen\n(2004)). To sustain the turbulence therefore requires an\nenergy source, for example from star formation, yet some\nclouds have turbulence but no current star formation.\nThe modern picture is one in which clouds are short-\nlived structures and the turbulence results from the same\nprocess that formed the cloud in the first place. Observa-\ntionally, GMCs turn a small fraction \u01eb\u22c6 \u2248 0.1 of their mass\ninto stars before they disperse again. This low star forma-\ntion efficiency of clouds may be due to the fact that they are\nshort lived. The short life times of (star forming) clouds also\nfollows from the small age spread in star clusters (see e.g.\nGomez et al (1992)), and indicates that star formation in a\ngiven cloud only lasts for a few million years. The short life-\ntimes of GMCs then also suggests that competitive accretion\n(e.g. Bonnell et al (1997)) is less important in shaping the\nIMF (Padoan & Nordlund (2002)).\nTurbulence generates a range of substructures inside\na GMC, and Padoan & Nordlund (2002) suggest that such\n\u2018turbulent fragmentation\u2019 builds a mass spectrum of proto-\ncores, some of which will collapse under their own gravity to\nform stars. The resulting IMF is a power-law due to the self-\nsimilar nature of the turbulence. Only cores dense enough so\nthat self gravity can overcome their magnetic and thermal\nenergy can collapse. This consideration flattens that IMF at\nlow masses, and prevents very low-mass cores from forming\nstars. They also argue that the maximum mass is a fraction\nof the overall cloud mass.\nA young stellar population does, of course, dump a lot\nof energy into its surroundings through stellar winds, ion-\nisation, and SN explosions. Even if these do not drive the\nobserved turbulence, they may contribute to the destruction\nof the cloud, and prevent further star formation. Most sim-\nulations use such feedback from star formation to regulate\nthe star formation rate.\n2.4 Summary\nThe current theory of star formation in disk galaxies sug-\ngests that supersonic turbulence, generated by a combina-\ntion of galactic rotation and SNe, regulates the formation\nof proto-stellar cores inside more massive molecular clouds.\nSome fraction of these clouds can form stars, before the\ncloud itself is destroyed, by a combination of stellar feedback\nand the turbulence that built the cloud in the first place.\nThe cooling of the cores to temperatures 6 100K is domi-\nnated by grains and CII fine-structures lines and is opposed\nby photo-electric heating from small grains and polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), see Wolfire et al (1995).\nA numerical implementation of these processes requires\nhigh resolution to model the interstellar turbulence and fol-\nlow the contraction of cores of masses a few M\u2299 at densities\nabove 1 particle per cm\u22123. Such challenging simulations may\nbe feasible in the near future for high-redshift galaxies but\nare not possible yet for z = 0 galaxies. Below we describe a\nmodel of cloud formation that tries to incorporate some of\nthese processes with some simple rules.\nWe would like to apply the same rules to cosmologi-\ncal simulations of galaxy formation, which clearly requires\na leap of faith. High-redshift galaxies may not have a well-\ndefined disk, and hence the properties of the supersonic tur-\nbulence and the GMCs may well be very different. In the\nhigh-redshift simulations of Abel, Bryan & Norman (2000),\nthe first molecular cloud is close to hydrostatic equilib-\nrium, with pressure support slowly leaking away as it cools\nthrough molecular hydrogen line emission. This quasi-static\nevolution, reminiscent of a cooling flow, is very different from\nthe dynamic turbulent fragmentation envisaged in the MW,\nwith corresponding large differences in the predicted IMF.\nFurthermore, if the properties of the GMCs were similar,\nthe behaviour of the cores may still be very different, with\nthe reduced grain and metal cooling at higher z, making for\na different IMF.\nDespite these difficulties we must start somewhere. The\nassumption that the physics of the ISM (and therefore the\nstellar IMF) is similar at redshift zero and in the high\nredshift universe is common in the simulation community.\nThe understanding gained through these necessarily simpli-\nfied simulations will allow us, over time, to investigate the\nphysics relevant to galaxy formation at higher redshift.\n3 DETAILS OF THE MODEL\nAs demonstrated in section 1, in typical simulations of\ngalaxy formation we can resolve the Jeans length of the am-\nbient gas phase and so treat its hydrodynamic properties\nconsistently. However, we cannot yet resolve the properties\nof the cold molecular phase of the ISM. We therefore follow\nthe evolution of the ambient gas phase using a hydrodynamic\nsimulation code, whereas we treat the cold phase using a sta-\ntistical model that encapsulates the physics relevant to the\nformation and evolution of molecular clouds. In this section\nwe introduce the properties of the sticky particle model and\ndescribe the physics we have implemented.\nFollowing Efstathiou (2000) we consider the ISM to con-\nsist of warm and hot ambient materials, and cold molecu-\nlar clouds. We additionally treat the properties of SN rem-\nnants. Throughout this paper the properties of the ambient\nmedium will be represented with the subscript h, the prop-\nerties of the molecular clouds with the subscript c, and the\nproperties of the gas internal to SN remnants, or hot bub-\nbles, with the subscript b.\nThe ambient gas phase is represented using the entropy\nconserving, parallel Tree-SPH code GADGET2 (Springel\n(2005); Springel, Yoshida & White (2001)), which is a La-\ngrangian code used to calculate gravitational and hydro-\ndynamic forces on a particle by particle basis. Smoothed-\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH) was originally introduced\nby Lucy (1977) and Gingold & Monaghan (1977), see e.g.\nMonaghan (1992) for a review. We will refer to the gas com-\nponent treated using SPH as ambient gas to distinguish it\nfrom the cold molecular gas. Ambient gas at temperatures\naround 104K will be referred to as \u2018warm\u2019 , and gas at tem-\nperatures of 106K and higher will be called \u2018hot\u2019 . We will see\nthat in galaxy formation simulations, this ambient (i.e. non-\nmolecular) medium naturally develops three relatively well-\ndefined phases: a warm (T \u223c 104K) component in a galactic\ndisk, a hot (T \u223c 106K)) tenuous component of shock-heated\ngas in the halo, and a similarly hot component resulting from\ngas heated by SN. The fourth, cold (T \u223c 100K) and molec-\nular cloud phase is represented with sticky particles, which\ninteract gravitationally with all other material in the simula-\ntion and are allowed to stick together forming more massive\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 5\nGiant\nMolecular\nClouds\nStars\nMolecular\nClouds\nHeated\nDiffuse\nGas\nDiffuse\nGas\nCoagulation\nFragmentation\nUnstable Collapse\nSup\nern\nova\n He\natin\ngRadiative Cooling\nThe\nrma\nl Co\nndu\nctio\nn (m\nild)\nTh\ner\nm\nal \nIn\nsta\nbil\nity\nTh\ner\nm\nal \nCo\nnd\nuc\ntio\nn\nFigure 1.

Stars and dark matter are both treated as\ncollisionless particles by GADGET2.\nThe different phases of the ISM may interact with each\nother as follows: thermally unstable ambient gas may col-\nlapse into molecular clouds via thermal instability (section\n3.1). Molecular clouds can interact with each other to form\nGMCs (section 3.2). GMCs then collapse into stars (section\n3.3). Stars disrupt the cloud they formed from and may, via\nSN feedback, return energy (section 3.4.1) to the ambient\nphase. Hot bubbles blown by SNe can evaporate cold clouds\n(3.5) and heat the ambient medium.\nFig 1 contains a summary of all of the physics imple-\nmented in our model. Arrows represent a transfer of mass\nand\/or energy from one phase to another. The distinction\nbetween clouds and GMCs is somewhat arbitrary; they are\nseparated in the figure to allow an easy pictorial represen-\ntation of mass transfer within a single phase. Appendix A\ncontains a list of frequently used symbols and their meaning.\nEach physical process will be treated in turn in the re-\nmainder of this section. We first introduce the physics rele-\nvant to each physical process before discussing the numerical\nimplementation. We will also give our preferred physical val-\nues for the various parameters that occur. How we choose\nthese is discussed in section 4.\n3.1 Radiative Cooling And The Formation of\nMolecular Clouds\nBegelman & McKee (1990) show that under appropriate\nphysical conditions, a thermal instability may operate in the\nambient gas, which causes a fraction of the gas to condense\ninto much colder molecular clouds. The sticky particle star\nformation prescription contains a basic representation of this\nprocess, based on a detailed treatment of baryonic radiative\ncooling.\n3.1.1 Relevant Physics\nThe radiative processes that we take into account are\nCompton cooling off the microwave background, thermal\nBremsstrahlung cooling, line cooling and photo-ionization\nheating from Hydrogen, Helium and metal species in the\npresence of an imposed ionising background. These routines\nwere developed for a different project and will be described\nelsewhere2. Briefly, they use tabulated rates for radiative\ncooling and photo-ionization heating for many species and\nionization states computed assuming ionization equilibrium\nusing cloudy (version 05.07 of the code last described\nby Ferland et al. (1998)) with a UV background given by\nHaardt & Madau (2001). The rates are tabulated element\nby element and we will assume solar abundance ratios and\nspecify a fixed metallicity of the gas in solar units. We do,\nhowever, note that the behaviour of the system may depend\nupon precisely which value of the metallicity we choose, and\ninvestigate this in section 5.3\nOther processes such as cosmic ray heating, and cooling\nby dust and atomic lines that affect the molecular gas in\nclouds are not treated explicitly since we do not model the\ninternal properties of the clouds themselves.\nWe include a simple model to determine the rate\nat which the ambient gas forms molecular clouds. When\nwe identify ambient gas that is thermally unstable\n(Begelman & McKee (1990)) we allow it to collapse into\nmolecular clouds. The rate at which this process occurs is\ngoverened by the rate at which the gas is losing thermal\nenergy by radiative cooling.\n3.1.2 Numerical Implementation\nFollowing Yepes et al. (1997) we define a density threshold,\n\u03c1th, to determine when gas becomes thermally unstable. Gas\nwith \u03c1 < \u03c1th undergoes ordinary radiative cooling. Gas with\ndensity above the threshold becomes thermally unstable and\nbegins to be converted to molecular clouds. In addition to\nthe density criterion we add a maximum temperature (Tth)\nfor gas to be called thermally unstable which has the effect\nof preventing SN heated gas in dense regions from collapsing\nstraight to the cold phase.\nWhen gas has been identified as thermally unstable it\nbegins to form molecular clouds at a rate controlled by the\nrate at which the gas can lose thermal energy by radiative\ncooling\nd\u03c1c\ndt\n= \u2212d\u03c1h\ndt\n=\n1\nuh \u2212 uc\u039bnet(\u03c1h, uh), (1)\nwhere u represent an internal energies per unit mass. The\nsubscripts h and c refer to the ambient phase (either warm\nor hot) and cold phase respectively. \u039bnet is the cooling rate\nof the ambient gas (ergs cm\u22123 s\u22121). We assume that the cold\nclouds remain at a fixed temperature of Tc = 100K hence\ntheir thermal energy uc is a constant as well.\nIn practice, each ambient gas particle is identified as\neither thermally unstable, or non-thermally unstable. non-\nthermally unstable gas undergoes radiative cooling; ther-\nmally unstable ambient gas forms molecular clouds at a\n2 We would like to thank our colleagues J Schaye, C Dalla Vecchia\nand R Wiersma for allowing us to use these rates.\n6 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nrate controlled by the radiative cooling rate, as described\nby Eq. 1.\nIn this way each ambient gas particle can keep track\nof what fraction of its mass is in the form of molecular\nclouds. Gas in the molecular phase is ignored for the pur-\nposes of the SPH calculation. When the amount of mass in\nthe molecular phase in a particle reaches the resolution limit\nof the simulation a separate \u2018sticky particle\u2019, representing\nmany sub-resolution molecular clouds is created. This pro-\ncess decouples the molecular clouds from the associated am-\nbient phase. Since we cannot resolve the individual molecu-\nlar clouds in each sticky particle we work with the mass func-\ntion of clouds. Initially we assume that the molecular clouds\nformed through instability are all in the smallest mass bin,\nthat is that the clouds formed by thermal instability are very\nsmall, and will interact to form more massive clouds. In the\nfollowing section we describe the behaviour and evolution of\nthe sticky particles in the simulation.\n3.2 Cloud Coagulation and GMC Formation\nMolecular clouds are typically many orders of magnitude\nmore dense than the medium they form in (MO77), and\ntheir behaviour is governed by a different set of rules than\nthe ambient medium. This section describes the physics of\nthe simplified molecular clouds in the sticky particle model\nand how it is implemented.\n3.2.1 Relevant Physics\nWe assume that clouds may be treated as approximately\nspherical objects that obey a power law relation between\nmass (Mc) and radius (rc)\nrc =\n\u201c Mc\nMref\n\u201d\u03b1c\nrref\n= 36\n\u201c Mc\n105M\u2299\n\u201d0.3\npc . (2)\nHere, \u03b1c describes how clouds grow as mass is added to\nthem (if they remain at constant density then \u03b1c = 1\/3),\nand Mref and rref are a reference mass and radius used to\nfix the normalisation of this relation. The lower bound on\nmolecular cloud masses is typically calculated to be 100M\u2299\n(Monaco (2004)) due to the efficient destruction of smaller\nmolecular clouds by photoionization. We introduce an upper\nlimit by converting molecular clouds with large masses into\nstars (see section 3.3 for discussion). In order to facilitate\neasy estimates of the relative importance of various effects\nwe have substituted typical numbers and units into most of\nthe equations in this section.\n3.2.2 Numerical Implementation\nEach sticky particle represents numerous cold clouds. Sticky\nparticles are hydrodynamically decoupled from the ambient\nSPH phase of the gas and interact only gravitationally with\nthe other phases in the simulation. However, when two sticky\nparticles collide they may coagulate to form a more massive\nsticky particle. The mass of the smallest molecular clouds\nis typically orders of magnitude below the mass resolution\nin a cosmological simulation. We represent an entire mass\nspectrum of clouds statistically inside of each sticky particle.\nOur formalism to treat the evolution of the mass function of\nclouds internal to each of the \u2019multiple cloud\u2019 particles will\nstart from the Smoluchowski equation of kinetic aggrega-\ntion (Smoluchowski (1916)), which describes the behaviour\nof a system consisting of ballistic particles that can inter-\nact via mergers. The coagulation behaviour of this system is\ndriven by a coagulation kernel, K(m1,m2), that represents\nthe formation rate of clouds of masses m = m1 +m2,\nK = \u3008\u03a3vapp\u3009v, (3)\nwhere vapp is the relative velocity of the clouds and \u03a3 is\nthe collision cross section. For a Maxwellian distribution\nof velocities with three-dimensional dispersion \u03c3 we obtain\n\u3008vapp\u3009 = 1.3\u03c3 (Lee & Nelson (1988)). The product of the\napproach velocity and the collision cross section is averaged\nover the distribution of relative velocities. The cross section\nis\n\u03a3 \u2248 \u03c0(rc + r\u2032c)2\n\u201c\n1 + 2G\nMc +M\n\u2032\nc\nrc + r\u2032c\n1\nv2app\n\u201d\n, (4)\nwhere the first term represents the collision geometric cross\nsection and the second term represents the effect of gravita-\ntional focusing (Saslaw (1985)). The focused term becomes\nsignificant when the approach velocity is not much larger\nthan the internal velocity dispersion of the system. In most\ncases of interest the geometric term will dominate so the\nfocused term is neglected. In these calculations we need to\nassume that molecular clouds, although transient and turbu-\nlent, are stable for long enough for coagulation to take place.\nThis is reasonable because the cloud velocity dispersion is\ntypically larger than the sound speed of the cold cloud gas\n(Monaco (2004)).\nTo model the cooling of sub-resolution molecular clouds\nvia gravitational interaction it has been assumed that when\nmolecular clouds with relative velocities, vapp greater than\nvstick (a parameter in our simulations) collide they do not\nmerge, but rather bounce back with relative velocity a frac-\ntion, \u03b7, of the initial approach velocity. Clouds with relative\nvelocities less than vstick merge. For simplicity it has been as-\nsumed that the velocity distribution of clouds is Maxwellian\nwith a velocity dispersion that is a function of cloud mass,\n\u03c3 = \u03c3(m).\nThe upper and lower bounds on the molecular cloud\nmass function are set such that the smallest mass bin is com-\nparable with the smallest clouds was can observe, and the\nlargest molecular clouds are approximately the same mass as\nthe largest clouds in the MW. The mass function is discrete.\nAll clouds are assumed to form at the lowest mass, Mmin,\nand then the mass of each bin is a multiple of this value. This\ndiscrete mass function is neccessary when working with the\nSmoluchowski equation.\nIn order for us to be able to hold a mass function with\na large number of bins internal to every single sticky par-\nticle without the requirement to store one number for each\nmass bin we parameterize the mass function as a third or-\nder polynomial, and store only the four coefficients between\ntimesteps.\nAs these sub-resolution clouds interact and merge, the\none-dimensional velocity dispersion \u03c3(m) changes, which af-\nfects the rate of evolution of the cloud mass function, n(m).\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 7\nLet Em = 3\/2m\u03c3\n2(m) denote the random kinetic energy of\nclouds with mass m. The one-dimensional velocity disper-\nsion is related to the three dimensional velocity dispersion\nby \u03c31D = \u03c33D\/\n\u221a\n3. Em and may change due to three distinct\nprocesses:\n\u2022 Clouds with masses m\u2032 and m\u2212m\u2032 merge to form extra\nclouds of mass m, increasing Em at a rate E\u02d9gain\n\u2022 Clouds with masses m may merge with clouds of any\nother mass decreasing the number of clouds of mass m. This\nprocess decreases Em at a rate E\u02d9loss\n\u2022 Clouds with mass m may interact collisionally with\nclouds of any other mass and so lose kinetic energy. This\nprocess decreases Em at a rate E\u02d9cool\nThe net change in kinetic energy for particles of mass\nm during some timestep \u2206t is given by\n\u2206Em =\ndEm\ndt\n\u2206t =\nh\nE\u02d9gain \u2212 E\u02d9loss \u2212 E\u02d9cool\ni\n\u2206t . (5)\nAnd for this change in kinetic energy, the corresponding\nchange in velocity dispersion is given by\n\u03c3\u02d9 =\n2E\u02d9 \u2212 M\u02d9\u03c32\n2M\u03c3\n. (6)\nDetails of the equations used to model these processes are\ngiven in Appendix B, and the method by which they are\nsolved numerically in Appendix C.\nThe same processes (cooling and merging) are followed\nexplicitly for the individual particles in our simulations,\nwhich can interact in the same two ways as the unresolved\nsub resolution clouds by merging to form more massive\nsticky particles, or cooling to decrease their relative ve-\nlocities. Following the same rules should allow us to re-\nmove much of the resolution dependence of the star for-\nmation prescription. As the mass resolution of a simula-\ntion is degraded, more massive clouds will be treated with\nthe sub-grid physics; our implementation should ensure that\nthe large scale results are approximately the same. This is\ndemonstrated in section 4.1.2.\n3.3 Cloud Collapse and Star Formation\nThe vast majority of stars form in Giant Molecular Clouds.\nThis process is described in the sticky particle model by\nallowing the most massive clouds in the galaxy to collapse\ninto stars.\n3.3.1 Relevant Physics\nWe follow the process of star formation in our simulations\nby waiting for star forming clouds to be created by the co-\nagulation process described in section 3.2. We define star\nforming clouds to be clouds of a mass similar to the most\nmassive clouds observed in the MW (\u223c 106M\u2299). When one\nof these star forming clouds is created it is assumed to col-\nlapse on a short timescale and approximately \u01eb\u22c6 \u223c 10% of\nits mass is converted into stars, whilst the remainder is dis-\nrupted by stellar feedback processes including stellar winds,\nSN feedback and photoionization. This process reflects that\nalthough stars may form in less massive molecular clouds,\nit is not until the relatively rare, massive O and B stars are\ncreated that the cloud is destroyed (Elmegreen (1983)).\nWe assume that each cloud collapse forms a single stel-\nlar population with an IMF of the standard Salpeter (1955)\nform\nN(M) dM \u221dM\u2212(1+x)dM , (7)\nwhere x is the slope of the IMF and takes the usual value\nof 1.35. The masses of stars are assumed to lie between well\ndefined minimum and maximum values,M\u22c6,min andM\u22c6,max.\n3.3.2 Numerical Implementation\nThe treatment of star formation adopted in most simulations\nis to identify gas that is likely to be star-forming and impose\na star formation rate given by the Schmidt law,\n\u03c1\u02d9\u22c6 = C\u03c1\nNSF\ngas . (8)\nHere, \u03c1\u02d9\u22c6 and \u03c1gas denote the rate of star formation per unit\nvolume and the gas density respectively. This power law rela-\ntion between star formation rate (SFR) and gas density was\nfound to hold over many orders of magnitude by Kennicutt\n(1998), who constrained the exponent to be NSF = 1.4\u00b10.2.\nWe take a different approach: unstable molecular clouds\nare identified in the simulations as any cloud with a mass\ngreater thanMsf . We identify the formation of these massive\nclouds by using the cloud mass function, as stored internally\nto every single sticky particle. These unstable clouds are\nassumed to collapse on a very short timescale, forming stars.\nAs soon as a cloud of massMsf forms, it is assumed to be\ndisrupted by OB stars on a timescale of \u223c10Myr (Matzner\n(2002)), the rest of the massive cloud is broken down into\nsmaller clouds and the coagulation process begins all over\nagain as described in section 3.2. This process is modelled\nby taking the fraction of the cloud\u2019s mass that does not\nturn into stars, 1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2217, and assuming that the net effect of\nthe stellar feedback processes is to fragment the GMC into\nthe smallest clouds represented in the sticky particle internal\nmass function. This has the net effect of steepening the cloud\nmass function.\nEach star particle formation event represents the for-\nmation of a single stellar population of stars that are all\nassumed to have the same age, and to be drawn from the\nSalpeter IMF. Each stellar particle is therefore formed with\na mass approximately equal to \u01eb\u2217 times the mass of a star-\nforming cloud. If this particle mass is not allowed by the\nmass resolution of a given simulation then we either store\nup unresolved stars internal to a sticky particle (if the star\nmass is too small to be allowed), or split it into multiple,\nequal mass particles (if the star mass is too large to be al-\nlowed).\n3.4 Supernova Feedback\nOur simulations include only energy feedback from type II\nSN. These events return energy from the stars to the ambi-\nent phase. We note that it is not currently computationally\nfeasible to resolve the properties of SN remnants so we treat\nthem with a simple, analytic prescription. The mechanism\nby which SN feedback is implemented in our model is dis-\ncussed here.\n8 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\n3.4.1 Relevant Physics\nEach star of mass greater than 8M\u2299 releases 10\n51E51 ergs in\nthermal energy when it undergoes an SN event. The lifetime,\nt, of a star of mass M (where M > 6.6M\u2299) is given by\n(Padovani & Matteucci (1993))\nt\nGyr\n= 1.2\n\u201c M\nM\u2299\n\u201d\u22121.85\n+ 0.003 . (9)\nEach SN explosion can be approximated as the injec-\ntion of energy at a single point in space. If we assume that\nthe ambient density on scales of interest is approximately\nhomogeneous, with density \u03c1h, then each SN explosion can\nbe modelled as a Sedov blast wave (Sedov (1959)). Accord-\ning to this solution, if at time t = 0 we release an amount\nof energy Eb, then after time t the resulting blast wave will\nhave reached a radius rb given by\nrb =\n\u201cEb\n\u03c1h\n\u201d1\/5\nt2\/5\n= 292\n\u201cEb\/1051ergs\n\u03c1h\/0.1 cm\u22123\n\u201d1\/5\n(t\/10Myr)2\/5 pc . (10)\nThese hot SN bubbles have two main effects. Firstly, as\nthey expand and decelerate the SN heated gas will get mixed\nin with the surrounding ambient medium; the net result of\nthis process is the heating of the ambient medium. Secondly,\nas discussed in section 3.5, any cold clouds caught inside an\nSN bubble will undergo evaporation.\nThere are two main assumptions that must hold for\nthe Sedov solution to be valid, the pressure of the ambi-\nent medium, and the cooling rate inside the bubble, must\nboth be negligible. Often at least one these assumptions is\ninvalid. If the ambient medium has a low density and is very\nhot, for example due to a previous set of explosions, then\nits pressure is no longer negligible and the Sedov solution\nbreaks down. If the ambient medium is dense then radiative\ncooling becomes an important process. In the remainder of\nthis section we describe various modifications to the stan-\ndard Sedov solutions, which allow us to model SN remnants\nin a wider variety of conditions.\nIn the case of a hot, tenuous medium the radius of each\nblast wave is increased (Tang & Wang (2005)). These au-\nthors derive a fitting formula for the velocity of a SN blast\nin a hot medium, which is accurate to within 3%\nrb(t) =\nZ t\n0\nch\n\u201c tc\nt\u2032\n+ 1\n\u201d3\/5\ndt\u2032 , (11)\n= 156\nZ t\/Myr\n0\n\u201c tc\nt\u2032\n+ 1\n\u201d3\/5\ndt\u2032 pc, (12)\nwhere ch is the sound speed of the ambient medium.

Comparison between SPH simulation of a Sedov blast,\nthe Sedov solution and the hot medium correction of Tang &\nWang (2005). The points represent individual SPH particles, the\ndashed line is the Sedov solution and the dotted line is the blast\nwave radius as calculated with the hot medium correction. The\ninitial condition had a density of 0.001 atoms per cm3 and a tem-\nperature of 106K. 1051ergs were injected to the central 32 particles\nat t0. This plot was made after the blast wave had evolved for 0.3\nMyr.\nThis solution matches the standard Sedov evolution, rb \u221d\nt2\/5, closely until t \u223c tc, after which the shell\u2019s velocity be-\ncomes constant, rb \u221d t. This modification allows us to take\ninto account that a the majority (\u223c90%), of SNII happen\nin preheated SN bubbles (Higdon et al (1998)) and, there-\nfore, the approximation that the pressure of the ambient\nmedium is negligible is often incorrect. Fig (2) shows the\ndifference between an adiabatic gas SPH simulation of a SN\ninduced shock-wave, the pure Sedov solution and the blast\nwave radius as predicted by the hot medium-modified Sedov\nsolution from Tang & Wang (2005).\nSituations where radiative cooling are important\nmay be taken into account using the prescription of\nThornton et al (1998), whose high resolution simulations of\nSN explosions expanding in an ambient medium with tem-\nperature Th = 10\n3K, provide the total thermal energy in SN\nbubbles as a function of time, ambient density and metallic-\nity. We perform bilinear interpolation on the results in tables\n2 and 4 of Thornton et al (1998) to obtain the SN bubble\nradius and thermal energy at any given time.\nNeither of these solutions treats the more general case\nof SN remnant expansion in a porous ISM, which may have\nregions of both high and low ambient density, and so we are\nnot able to include the effects of SNe fully self-consistent.\nIn most of our simulations we use the simple Sedov solution\nfor the evolution of the SN blast waves, but note that the\ndetails of our prescription are uncertain. In section 5.3 we\ninvestigate the effects of using different implementations of\nthe blast wave implementation to estimate how important\nthe details of the behaviour of SN remnants are to the overall\nproperties of the galaxy. Both the radiative cooling and blast\nwave velocity physics are varied.\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 9\n3.4.2 Numerical Implementation\nBy assuming that each stellar particle in the simulation rep-\nresents an entire population with the same age we can cal-\nculate the minimum and maximum masses of stars that un-\ndergo supernova events over any given time period using\nEq (9). Each of these supernovae is assumed to go off in a\nneighbouring gas particle (i.e. one for which the distance, r,\nto the star is smaller than its smoothing length, h, in the\nSPH formalism). We chose this particle randomly from the\nneighbours, with a weight computed from the solid angle,\n\u2126, it subtends on the sky as seen from the position of the\nstar particle,\n\u2126 = 4\u03c0\n\u201c\n1\u2212 rp\n(r2 + h2)\n\u201d\n. (14)\nThis weighting forces that nearby hot, diffuse gas (which\ntends to have larger h, hence larger weight) is heated more\nfrequently than cooler, denser parts of the ambient medium\n(which are dense, hence have smaller h).\nWe do not transfer all SN energy to gas particles\neach timestep. Assuming that SN explosions are distributed\nevenly in time and space we can calculate for every ambient\ngas particle a \u2018porosity\u2019 of SN bubbles, Q = VB\/VA. For the\nvolume associated with a gas particle we use VA = (4\u03c0\/3)h\n3,\nand VB = (4\u03c0\/3)\nP\nr3b is the total volume of all the SN bub-\nbles in this particle. When Q is greater than a critical value,\nQcrit \u2248 1, the ambient phase is heated, else the available SN\nenergy is carried over to the next time step. This ensures\nthat the ambient phase is only heated when hot supernova\nbubbles make up a significant fraction of the volume. There\nare two motivations for this, firstly a given SPH particle\ncannot represent more than one phase at a given time. Sec-\nondly simulations usually do not limit the timestep to be a\nfraction of the cooling time. Consider a warm, T \u223c 104K,\nSPH particle in the disk. If a small amount of SN energy is\ninjected into this dense particle, it will cool very efficiently\nsince the cooling rate is very high. It is only when the particle\nis heated to T \u226b 106K that the reduced cooling may affect\nthe particle dynamically, so that it will move into lower den-\nsity gas, further decreasing its cooling rate, and becoming\npart of the hot, tenuous gas. Storing the available heating\nuntil the SN bubbles fill a significant fraction of the parti-\ncle is a way of easing the transition from warm to hot and\nmakes the outcome less dependent on the timestep.\nTo determine the porosity Q, we need to know the cur-\nrent radii, rb, of SN bubbles. The radius rb depends on the\nambient gas properties and also on the available energy, Eb,\nas discussed in section 3.4.1. Typically a single stellar parti-\ncle will undergo multiple SN events over a single timestep.\nUsing Eqs. (9) and (10) and obtaining the SPH estimate of\nthe ambient gas density at the position of the star particle\nwe can estimate the average radius of all supernova bubbles\nblown by a given star particle at any time. Working under\nthe assumption that the porosity of the ISM is low we cal-\nculate the radiative loss from each bubble separately. When\nthe porosity of the ISM becomes Q > Qcrit \u223c 1, the SN bub-\nbles are overlapping significantly and all coherent structure\nis assumed to be wiped out. The ambient gas particles are\nheated by the remaining thermal energy in the supernova\nbubbles and they are considered to disperse. The porosity is\nset back to zero. Note that using the Sedov solution implies\nwe neglect radiative cooling in the remnants to determine\nthe porosity, Q. However to determine how much energy is\nin the bubbles once we decide to heat the particle, we do use\nthe tables of Thornton et al (1998) to account for radiative\ncooling in the SN shells. We believe that even though this\ntreatment is not fully consistent, it does capture the main\nphysics.\n3.5 Thermal Conduction\nThermal conduction between the ambient and cold gas in the\nsimulation is an important ingredient in the self-regulation\nof the star formation rate in our model of the ISM.\n3.5.1 Relevant Physics\nThermal conduction has two primary effects. The first is\nto smooth out the temperature and density profiles inside\nSN remnants. In the strong explosion solution of Sedov,\nwhere thermal conduction is neglected, the temperature of\nthe blast wave increases sharply towards the centre of the\nblast. This is due to the fact that the gas near the origin was\nheated by a stronger shock than that at the edges and there-\nafter evolves adiabatically. The effect of thermal conduction\nis to efficiently transport heat from the centre of the blast\nto the outer cool regions. The temperature of the interior\nof the supernova blast, Tb, is then approximately constant\nand equal to the mean temperature of the blast(Chevalier\n(1975); MO77):\u201c Tb\n108K\n\u201d\n= 1.2\n\u201c rb\n10pc\n\u201d\u22123\n(\nnb\n0.1 cm\u22123\n)\u22121(\nEb\n1051erg\n) , (15)\nwhere nb and Tb are the mean density and temperature in-\nside the bubble, respectively. We assume rb to be described\nby Sedov\u2019s self-similar solution. The density nb is also ap-\nproximately constant and is given in terms of the ambient\ndensity, nh, as\nnb\nnh\n= 1 + x\u22125\/3 (16)\nx \u2261 0.65\n\u201c rb\n10pc\n\u201d\n\u03a31\/5con(\nnh\ncm\u22123\n)3\/5(\nEb\n1051erg\n)\u22122\/5 . (17)\nThe dimensionless number \u03a3con represents the effectiveness\nof evaporation,\n\u03a3con =\n\u03b1con\n3\n\u201c rc\npc\n\u201d2\nf\u22121cl \u03c6\n\u22121, (18)\n(McKee (1977)), and depends on \u03b1con = r\u02d9b\/ch (the ratio\nof the velocity of the supernova blast wave to the sound\nspeed of the medium), the cloud\u2019s radius, rc, the volume\nfilling factor of the cold clouds, fcl, and the efficiency of\nthermal conduction, \u03c6 (see MO77 for details). For a pure\nSedov blast wave \u03b1con = 1.68. The presence of magnetic\nfields and turbulence may decrease \u03c6 below its maximum\nvalue of \u03c6 = 1. We compute fcl for each sticky particle from\nits current cloud mass spectrum given the assumed cloud\nmass-radius relation, Eq. (2).\nThe second effect of thermal conduction is to evaporate\ncold clouds. According to (McKee (1977); Cowie (1977)),\nthe evaporation rate is well described by:\n\u201c M\u02d9c\nM\u2299Myr\n\u22121\n\u201d\n= \u22120.44\u00d7\n\u201c T\n106K\n\u201d5\/2\u201c rc\npc\n\u201d\n. (19)\n10 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\n3.5.2 Numerical Implementation\nSince we store the mass function of molecular clouds inter-\nnal to each sticky particle explicitly (Sect. 3.2), we can apply\nEq. (19) along with Eq. (2) to each cloud mass bin to cal-\nculate the total mass loss of a cloud over one timestep. The\nevaporation rate of the cloud depends on the temperature\nof the ambient gas, which is represented with SPH particles.\nHowever, as we discussed above, some fraction Q of the vol-\nume of each SPH particle may be filled by hot SN bubbles,\nin which the evaporation rate of clouds may be much higher.\nSince we have computed Q, we can take this important effect\ninto account.\nConsider a single molecular cloud in thermal contact\nwith an ambient medium of (constant) temperature T . The\nmass of a cloud at the end of a timestep (Mf ) is related to\nits mass at the start of the timestep (Mi) by:\nMf =\nh\nM1\u2212\u03b1ci \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1c)\n0.44T 5\/2rref\nM\u03b1cref\n\u2206t\ni1\/(1\u2212\u03b1c)\n, (20)\nwhere T is in units of 106K, masses are in M\u2299, lengths are\nin pc and times are in Myr.\nEq (20) represents the mass loss rate for a single cloud\nin contact with a medium of temperature T . More generally\nin a porous medium a single cloud of mass m has a mean\nmass loss rate described by:\nM\u02d9cloud = \u2212QM\u02d9bubble \u2212 (1\u2212Q)M\u02d9ambient, (21)\nwhere m\u02d9bubble and m\u02d9ambient represent the rate of mass loss\nfor a cloud inside a supernova bubble and situated in the\nambient medium respectively.\nEq. (20) can be applied directly to the evaporation of\na cloud in the local ambient medium (m\u02d9ambient). However\nto apply the same formula to the evaporation of clouds in-\nside of supernova bubbles we need to account for the fact\nthat although the temperature inside the bubbles remains\nuniform, due to conduction, it is not constant in time, but\ndecreases as the bubble expands. We therefore make the\nadditional assumption that the mean temperature of the\nsupernova remnant is constant over a timestep (a good ap-\nproximation after a short (\u223c 20yr) transient phase). Under\nthis assumption Eq. (20) can be applied successfully to the\nmore general case of evaporation in a porous medium. Eq\n(19) and Eq (2) are used to show that the total mass loss\nrate for clouds of mass m in a volume VA is given by\n\u201c M\u02d9c\nM\u2299Myr\n\u22121\n\u201d\n= \u22120.44\n\u201cMc\nM\u2299\n\u201d\u03b1c\u201crref\npc\n\u201d\u201cMref\nM\u2299\n\u201d\u2212\u03b1c\n \nQ\n\u201c Tb\n106K\n\u201d5\/2\n+ (1\u2212Q)\n\u201c Ta\n106K\n\u201d5\/2!\n. (22)\nUnder the assumption that Tb, the mean temperature of su-\npernova remnants, and Ta, the mean ambient temperature,\nare constant over any single timestep we can write\n\u201c M\u02d9c\nM\u2299Myr\n\u22121\n\u201d\n\u2261 \u03bb\n\u201cMc\nM\u2299\n\u201d\u03b1c\n, (23)\nIn order to calculate the constant of proportionality, \u03bb, we\nuse an estimate of the mean temperature and density inside\nof a supernova remnant. These estimates were obtained by\nnoting that by definition Q \u2261 VB\/VA. (VB and VA represent\nFigure 3.

The mean density inside the supernova\nremnants, nb, may then be calculated from Eq (16) and\nEq (17) and the mean temperature from Eq (15).\nOver a period of time \u2206t a cloud with mass MI will\nevaporate to a mass of MF , given by:\nMF =\n\u201c\nM\n(1\u2212\u03b1c)\nI \u2212 \u03bb\u2206t\n\u201d1\/(1\u2212\u03b1c)\n(25)\nThermal conduction efficiently destroys smaller clouds,\nbut its effects are far less dramatic on larger clouds. Fig (3)\nshows the evolution of an initially power law mass spectrum\nof clouds in a hot medium. The energy used to evaporate a\nmassMF \u2212MI of cold clouds is removed from the supernova\nremnants.\n3.6 Mass Resolution Limits\nThe sticky particle model allows particles of all types to\nchange their mass via processes including merging, thermal\nconduction and star formation. For this reason it is neces-\nsary for us to introduce numerical minimum and maximum\nmasses on all particle types. We define at the initial time\na characteristic mass resolution for our simulation, Mchar,\ntypically this is set equal to the mass of the ambient gas par-\nticles in the initial conditions. Where more than one mass of\nambient particles is present (for example in the model galax-\nies discussed in section 5) we use the mass of the gas particles\nthat will be forming most stars. We then define minimum\nand maximum particle masses relative to this characteristic\nmass scale.\nAmbient gas particles may have their mass decreased\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 11\nby the formation of molecular clouds. If the total mass of a\ngas particle becomes less than 0.1Mchar then it is converted\nentirely into a cloud particle. The ambient gas particles may\nalso have their mass increased by the process of thermal\nconduction. If a gas particle becomes more massive than\n4Mchar then it is not allowed to grow any more, and the\nevaporated cloud mass is given to a different particle. In\npractice this limit is rarely, if ever, reached as evaporating\ncold clouds effectively cools the ambient gas particles so they\nbecome inefficient at thermal conduction.\nSticky particles may decrease their mass by star forma-\ntion and evaporation. If the mass of a sticky particle drops\nbelow 0.1Mchar then it is either completely evaporated or\ncompletely converted into stars. Coagulation may drive the\nmass of a sticky particle to be very large. In practice this is\nnot a real concern since when a sticky particle becomes very\nmassive the rate at which its internal clouds coagulate also\nincreases, causing it to form stars very rapidly.\nStars have a maximum and minimum mass of 4Mchar\nand 0.1Mchar. If a star forms with a mass greater than the\nmaximum allowed mass it is split into a number of smaller\nstar particles. A sticky particle may not form a star with a\nmass lower than the minimum allowed mass. In this even-\ntuality then the mass of the \u2018unresolved\u2019 stars is tracked\ninternally by the sticky particle and added into the next\nstar formation event until the total mass of stars formed\nreaches the resolution limit of the simulation.\nThese particle mass limits keep all particle masses in the\nrange 0.1Mchar to 4Mchar, which both minimises two body\neffects between very massive and very small particles and\nalso prevents the formation of very many low mass particles,\nwhich are computationally very expensive to evolve.\n4 PARAMETER ESTIMATION\nThe various physical processes in the star formation and\nfeedback models each have associated with them physical\nparameters. Before we discuss the properties of our model in\ndetail we discuss how its free parameters can be constrained.\nThe free parameters that control the thermal instabil-\nity and formation of the molecular clouds are \u03c1th and Tth,\nthe physical density and temperature at which thermal in-\nstability is allowed to set in and radiative cooling creates\nmolecular clouds. Wolfire et al (1995) found that a diffuse\nISM naturally settles into two stable phases, with a sharp\ncutoff between the ambient and molecular phases at a den-\nsity of approximately 1 atom per cm3. We use this as the\nvalue of \u03c1th. A threshold temperature Tth = 10\n5K allows\nthe gas in galaxies which cools radiatively to \u223c 104K to\ncollapse into clouds but prevents supernova heated material\n(typically at temperatures of 106K) from forming molecu-\nlar clouds until it has radiated away most of its supernova\nenergy.\nThe properties of the molecular clouds themselves are\ncontained in four parameters: rref ,Mref , and \u03b1c as defined in\nEq (2) and uc, the internal energy per unit mass of molecu-\nlar clouds. The first three values are set by comparison with\nobservations of molecular clouds in the nearby galaxy M33\n(Wilson & Scoville (1990)):\u201c rc\npc\n\u201d\n= (36\u00b1 6)\n\u201c M\n105M\u2299\n\u201d0.3\u00b10.1\n(26)\nThus rref and Mref are assumed to be 36pc and 10\n5M\u2299 re-\nspectively. This calibration (and an assumed \u03b1c of 0.3) sug-\ngest a radius of 122\u00b1 6pc for the largest clouds observed in\nthe MW ( 6\u00d7 106M\u2299 (Williams & McKee (1997)).\nThe properties of the stars and associated feedback are\ncontained within four parameters: x, the slope of the IMF;\nE51, the energy of each supernova blast in units of 10\n51erg;\nM\u22c6,min, the minimum star mass; and M\u22c6,max, the mass of\nthe largest allowed stars. For E51 we use the fiducial value\nof 1.0 noting, however, that the value of E51 is very uncer-\ntain and may be significantly higher. The effects of varying\nE51 are investigated in section 5.3. For the purposes of this\nwork uncertainties in the IMF are neglected and x is as-\nsumed to take on the standard Salpeter value of 1.35. We\nfollow Kawata & Gibson (2003) in adopting values 0.2M\u2299\nand 60M\u2299 for the minimum and maximum stellar masses,\nrespectively.\nThe star formation efficiency in a single cloud collapse is\nalso somewhat uncertain and is known to be approximately\n\u01eb\u22c6 \u2248 11% (Williams & McKee (1997)) in the MW.\nThe thermal conduction efficiency is characterised by\ntwo numbers: \u03b1con, the ratio of the blast wave velocity to\nthe ambient sound speed and \u03c6, the efficiency of thermal\nconduction. Following MO77, the value of \u03b1con is set to 2.5\n(for the ideal Sedov blast wave case, \u03b1con is 1.68, the pres-\nence of thermal conduction changes this value). The thermal\nconduction efficiency parameter is assumed to be \u03c6 = 1. The\npresence of magnetic fields and turbulence may change \u03c6 sig-\nnificantly; we investigate the effect of moving away from this\nvalue in Sect. 5.3\nThis leaves vstick (the maximum relative cloud velocity\nfor mergers) and \u03b7 (the fraction of a cloud\u2019s velocity lost\nper non-merger collision) as free parameters that are hard\nto constrain via observation. It is noted that the large scale\nbehaviour of a given simulation is largely independent of the\nvalue of \u03b7. This is because the cold cloud velocity dispersion\nis always limited by vstick. In the following section simple\nsimulations are used in order to calibrate the properties of\nthe physical model.\n4.1 One Zone Simulations\n4.1.1 Simulation Details\nA \u2018one zone model\u2019 is a periodic box that represents a fixed\nmass and volume (i.e. a static, periodic box with no mass\noutflow). The ambient ISM phase is assumed to be homo-\ngeneous. Initially, for a chosen mean density of matter we\nassume that 50% of the material is initially in the hot phase\nat a temperature of T0 = 10\n6K. The remaining gas is ini-\ntially in cold clouds with an initial mass function that is a\nvery steep (N(M)dM \u221d M\u22128dM) power law. Numerically\nwe represent the different phases as follows: the ambient\nphase is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic and so is\nrepresented by a single density and temperature throughout\nthe whole periodic volume, molecular clouds are represented\nby discrete sticky particles that are spawned at a random\npoint in the computational volume with a random velocity,\nstars are not tracked individually, and are assumed to heat\nthe whole volume evenly when they undergo SN explosions.\nThe mass resolution of the molecular phase is approximately\n107M\u2299, although this figure is varied in section 4.1.2\n12 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nFigure 4. Star formation rate as a function of time for a one zone\nbox with three different values of vstick. The initial gas density is\nn0 = 2 cm\u22123 in each case. Each curve follows the same general\nshape, there is an initial delay during which the first GMCs are\nforming. The unopposed collapse of the first GMCs causes a burst\nof star formation, which is quickly regulated by the effects of\nfeedback from stellar winds and supernova explosions. After this\ninitial burst the star formation rate in the simulation settles down\nand gradually decreases as the gas in the box is used up.\nThis initial situation represents hot, dense gas that has\njust begun to experience a thermal instability and started\nforming its first molecular clouds. The volume we simu-\nlate is one cubic kpc. The hot phase will evaporate cold\nclouds through thermal conduction, and can cool via ra-\ndiative processes using a simple tabulated cooling function\nfrom Sutherland & Dopita (1993) (assuming solar metallic-\nity). Cold cloud particles are scattered randomly through-\nout the volume and given random velocities. Clouds do not\nfeel gravitational forces. Depending on the parameters, the\nambient phase will cool radiatively to form more molecu-\nlar gas. Clouds will coagulate to form GMCs, which in turn\nform stars. The associated SNe evaporate smaller clouds,\nand may heat the ambient medium and quench the star\nformation. This sequence of events is plotted in Fig (4),\nthe same general shape is observed for each value of vstick,\nthere is a brief delay as the first clouds coagulate to form\nGMCs, these clouds them collapse and form stars, which\nundergo supernovae and quench the star formation. On a\nlonger timescale, the quiescent star formation rate slowly de-\ncreases as the available gas is consumed by stars. Since the\ndynamical equilibrium is reached on a very short timescale,\ntypically a couple of hundred Myr, we assume instantaneous\nrecycling when considering supernova feedback. The role of\nTth is suppressed in the one zone simulations, due to the\nface that energy injected via supernovae cannot escape the\nvolume.\nThe lack of self gravity does not affect the global prop-\nerties of the volume significantly. From Eq (4) assuming\ntypical cloud properties (Mc \u2248 105M\u2299, r \u2248 50pc) and a\nreasonable velocity dispersion (\u03c31D = 7km\/s) the ratio of\nthe geometric part of the cross section to the gravitationally\nfocused part is approximately 0.1, therefore direct collisions\nbetween clouds account for the majority of the collisions and\ngravitational focusing makes for an effect of only 10%. In the\nFigure 5.Mass function of clouds after 1Gyr in a one zone model.\nThe dashed and dotted lines represent the slopes of the mass\nfunctions in the MW (Solomon et al (1987))and M33 (Rosolowsky\n& Blitz (2004)). The numbers in the legend represent the power\nlaw slopes in each of the galaxies. It is clear that we obtain a\ngood agreement between our model and the cloud mass spectrum\nin real galaxies.\nfollowing section we will choose a value of vstick by compar-\ning the star formation rates in one zone volumes with the\nSchmidt law, and also look at the properties of one zone\nvolumes.\nAs noted in section 4 the properties of the simulation are\nlargely independent of \u03b7. We assume a value of 0.5 through-\nout the rest of this paper.\n4.1.2 Calibrating the base model\nThe one zone model provides a useful sandbox in which we\ncan investigate a wide variety of parameter choices in a rela-\ntively computationally inexpensive environment. In the fol-\nlowing section we discuss our choices for the values of the\ndifferent parameters. The effects of moving away from this\n\u2018base model\u2019 are discussed more fully in later sections.\nThe parameters that are available for tuning the output\nof the model are as follows: the cold cloud reference size\nand radius (rref , Mref); the slope of the cloud mass-radius\nrelation, \u03b1c; the efficiency of star formation in any given\ncloud collapse, \u01eb\u22c6; the maximum relative cloud velocity for\nmerger (vstick) and the amount of energy ejected per SNII\nevent (E51).\nEven though the initially assumed cloud spectrum,\nN(M)dM \u221d M\u22128 dM , is very steep and far from equilib-\nrium, SNe feedback and cloud coagulation rapidly build a\nmass spectrum N(M)dM \u221d M\u2212\u03b1 dM with \u03b1 \u2248 2 (Fig\n(5)), close to what is the observed cloud spectrum in the\nMW (dashed line) and M33 (dotted lines). This gives us\nconfidence that, although the modelling of cloud formation\nis simple, it does produce a realistic cloud spectrum.\nThe ISM model can also reproduce the observed\nSchmidt law. We find that in our model the interaction be-\ntween the coagulation of clouds and their destruction by\nstars leads to a SFR-density relation that is in good agree-\nment with observation (Fig (6)) if vstick is set to 7km\/s.\nThis represents a reasonable value for the molecular cloud\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 13\nFigure 6. Schmidt law. The diagonal dashed line represents the\nobserved star formation law (Kennicutt 1998) and the vertical\nline represents the observed cutoff in star formation (10M\u2299pc\u22122;\nSchaye 2004). Each point represents the star formation rate av-\neraged over a period of 500Myr for a separate one zone simula-\ntion. Data is shown for three different values of vstick, the base\nvalue used in all subsequent simulations is 7km\/s. We calculate\nstar formation rates by averaging the star formation rate in the\nsimulation volume over a 500Myr period. Surface densities were\ncalculated from volume densities by assuming a disk of thickness\nof 1kpc.\nFigure 7. Star formation rate as a function of time for one zone\nmodels with three different mass resolutions. The star formation\nrate remains almost unchanged over two orders of magnitude in\nmass resolution. The coarsest mass resolution of 109M\u2299 corre-\nsponds to the entire one-zone system being represented with a\nsingle particle with all clouds interactions modelled with the co-\nagulation equations.\nvelocity dispersion, as considering theoretical models for the\norigin of random motion on molecular clouds, we would\nexpect typical velocity dispersions in the range 5-7km\/s\n(Jog & Ostriker (1988)).\nThe effect of changing the mass resolution of the simu-\nlation over two orders of magnitude is demonstrated in Fig\n(7). Sub-resolution clouds that are simulated only by inte-\ngrating the coagulation equations are designed to behave\nin exactly the same way as the resolved cloud particles in\nFigure 8. Temperature and density of the ambient phase of a one\nzone model for a variety of different choices of initial temperature\nand density. The total gas density, ambient gas plus clouds, is\nalways 2 cm\u22123. The interplay of supernova feedback and radiative\ncooling quickly brings the system into an equilibrium independent\nof the initial value.\nFigure 9. The large scale properties of a one zone model with\ninitial density n0 = 2 cm\u22123. The physical parameters used in this\nmodel are the same as the base model as discussed in section 4.1.2\n14 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nFigure 10. Same as Fig (9) except with an initial gas density\nof n0 = 16 cm\u22123\nthe simulation, and so we expect the simulations not to de-\npend strongly on particle number. This is borne out by the\ngood agreement between simulations carried out with only\none resolved particle (Fig (7), line with mass resolution of\n109M\u2299) where all of the physics is followed by integrating\nthe sub-grid equations in a single particle and simulations\nwith a hundred particles that are followed explicitly.\nAs stated in previous sections, the behaviour of a one\nzone model is virtually independent of its initial tempera-\nture and the fraction of the gas that starts off in the cold\nphase. This behaviour is demonstrated in Fig (8). A one\nzone volume with total initial density of n0 = 2cm\n\u22123 was\nevolved with a variety of different initial values for the ini-\ntial temperature and initial fraction of the mass in the hot\nphase. We observe that regardless of the initial choices for\nthese two quantities the system quickly settles down to its\nequilibrium state. This process occurs through the opposing\nactions of thermal conduction and supernova feedback.\nFig (9) and Fig (10) show the behaviour of the large\nscale properties of two different one zone volumes as a func-\ntion of time. The only difference in the initial conditions of\nthe two one zone volumes is their initial density Fig (9)\nshows the evolution of a one zone volume with a total den-\nsity of 2 atoms\/cm3; Fig (10) shows exactly the same plots\nfor a density of 16 atoms\/cm3. The initial temperature of\nthe hot phase in both simulations is 106K. In both cases the\nstar formation rate follows the same general shape. There\nis a small period of time at the beginning of the simula-\ntion where small clouds are coagulating and there is no star\nformation. When GMCs are formed there is a large burst\nof star formation that is quickly quenched by feedback SN\nand thermal conduction in SN bubbles. The temperature of\nthe diffuse phase is regulated by a combination of supernova\nfeedback (acting to increase the temperature) and radiative\ncooling. Due to the fact that we do not allow mass to leave\nthe one zone volume and also assume instantaneous recy-\ncling, the temperature profile very closely matches that of\nthe star formation rate. It is noted that in the one zone\nsimulation with the largest density, the temperature of the\nambient phase is held at a higher temperature by the ac-\ntion of supernovae. The fraction of the gas in the molecular\nphase is lower in the high density simulation due to the in-\ncreased amount of evaporation by thermal conduction in the\nhigh temperature ambient phase. In the following sections\nthe star formation and feedback prescriptions are tested in\na more realistic situation.\n5 RESULTS\nAs a more physically interesting test of the star formation\nmodel we have conducted simulations of various isolated\nmodel galaxies. In this section we introduce the details of\nthe two different types of simulation performed and present\nthe properties of the stellar disk and associated ISM in each\ncase.\n5.1 Quiescent Disk\nOne of the fundamental properties that a star formation pre-\nscription must be able to reproduce is that in MW like condi-\ntions, the resulting behaviour should be similar to that in the\nMW. In this section we discuss the properties of galaxy sim-\nulations set up to approximate the conditions in the MW\u2019s\nquiescent disk.\n5.1.1 Simulation Details\nWe set up a simplified model of a MW type galaxy us-\ning initial conditions from GalactICS (Kuijken & Dubinski\n(1995)). GalactICS generates near equilibrium distributions\nof collisionless particles consisting of a disk, bulge and halo.\nThese models consist of a spherical bulge component; an\napproximately exponential disk, which is rotationally sup-\nported in the x-y plane and supported by random motion in\nthe z direction; and an approximately spherical halo.\nWe add baryonic material to this distribution by con-\nverting the disk and bulge in their entirety into SPH par-\nticles at a temperature of 104K. 1% of the material in the\nhalo is converted to baryons with a temperature of 106K.\nThe addition of baryonic material puts the system well out\nof equilibrium so each simulation is run adiabatically for\n50Myr to allow the galaxy to relax closer to its equilibrium\nstate before the additional physics is allowed to operate.\nThe total mass in the disk, bulge and halo are 1\u00d7 1010M\u2299,\n0.43 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 and 1.1 \u00d7 1011M\u2299 respectively. The mass\nresolution of particles in each of three realisations of this\ngalaxy are summarised in table 1. These masses were chosen\nsuch that the gaseous particles in each of the three compo-\nnents have approximately the same mass and the dark mat-\nter halo particles have masses as close as possible to the gas\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 15\nResolution (M\u2299) Disk Bulge Halo\nLow 6.6\u00d7 106 5.84\u00d7 106 5.6\u00d7 106\nBase 8.3\u00d7 105 7.5\u00d7 105 7.1\u00d7 105\nHigh 1.0\u00d7 105 9.2\u00d7 104 1.0\u00d7 105\nTable 1.

All masses are in units of M\u2299. Baryons\nare added to the dark matter halo by converting a random 1% of\nthe halo DM particles into gas. The dark matter particle mass in\nthe halo is therefore the same as the gas particle mass.\nFigure 11. Demonstration of the star formation properties of the\nisolated galactic disk.

The gravitational softenings for the disk par-\nticles (that is: gas, sticky and star) is set to 0.1kpc, 0.05kpc\nand 0.02kpc in simulations GAL LORES, GAL BASE and\nGAL HIRES respectively. The dark matter particles have\nsoftening lengths ten times larger than the disk particles.\nThe GalactICS simulations provide a test of the code in\na situation somewhat similar to a quiescent MW disk. As dis-\ncussed in section 3, all simulations were performed with the\nentropy conserving SPH code GADGET2 (Springel (2005)),\nwith all of the physics discussed in section 3 implemented\nas additional modules. Table 2 contains a brief summary of\nthe different simulations. Typical timestep size in one of the\nbase simulations is \u223c 104yr, although this figure is smaller at\nearly times when bursts of supernovae heat gas very strongly.\nFigure 13.

Most simulations\nwere run at the base mass resolution as defined in table 1.\nThe large scale behaviour of the model galaxy is as fol-\nlows: Immediately after switching on the additional star for-\nmation physics the dense, thermally unstable gas in the disk\nand bulge collapses into cold clouds, which quickly cause a\nlarge burst of star formation. After approximately 500Myr\nthe galaxy settles down into a quiescent state with a star\nformation rate of approximately 1M\u2299\/yr. The star forma-\n16 C. M.

Brief table of simulation references and details. Ngas shows the number of gas particles in the disk, bulge and halo combined.\ntion rate gradually decreases as the cold gas in the galaxy\nis consumed by stars.\nIt is known that in the MW, most areas of active star\nformation are concentrated in the galactic spiral arms (e.g.\nEngargiola et al (2003)). Fig (11) shows that our simula-\ntions reproduce this behaviour. In the sticky particle model\nthis behaviour occurs naturally as the converging gas flows\nin galactic spiral arms lead to an increased merger rate and,\ntherefore, to the presence of more star forming clouds. Face\nand edge on temperature and density plots of the standard\nresolution galaxy are shown in Fig (12). The gas heated\nby SNII is preferentially situated perpendicular to the plane\nof the disk, suggesting that the feedback scheme is prefer-\nentially heating the low density gas and setting up strong\noutflows. Fig (13) shows the behaviour of the supernova\nheated gas in a thin slice through the centre of the disk. Ini-\ntially there is a strong burst of star formation (lower panel\nof Fig (13)), followed shortly by a burst of supernova ex-\nplosions that heat the gas around the galactic disk as hot at\n108K. Most of this gas is driven straight out of the halo in a\ndirection perpendicular to the galactic disk. Later on, as the\nsupernova rate dies down, gas is heated more gently and is\nejected from the galactic disk in the form of a fountain rem-\niniscent of the galactic fountains present in the MW. This\nbehaviour is demonstrated in figure 14, which shows for a\nrandom subset of particles from the gas disk the number of\ntimes they have been heated as a function of time with their\nheight above the galactic disk. It is clear that upon being\nstrongly heated, some particles are ejected from the galactic\ndisk and fall back down a few hundred Myr later. Others\nremain in dense regions and cool immediately. Some escape\nthe disk completely in the form of a galactic wind. This be-\nhaviour was also observed in the multiphase star formation\nmodels of Scannapieco et al (2006), suggesting that it is a\nmore general feature of multiphase models.\nAdditionally our simulated galaxies are in good agree-\nment with the observed Schmidt law, Eq (15). This be-\nhaviour arises due to the self-regulation of the simulated\nISM. At higher densities more molecular clouds are formed\nand so star formation rates are higher. Runaway star for-\nmation is prevented by various forms of stellar feedback,\nwhich prevent too many clouds from forming. The slope of\nthe Schmidt law in the simulated galaxies may be changed\nby altering the value of vstick. Higher values of vstick lead to\nclouds coagulating more rapidly, and so low density regions\nof the galactic disk undergo more star formation. The effect\nis less severe in the higher density regions of the galaxy as\nstrong feedback from large bursts of star formation can ef-\nfectively regulate the amount of star formation. Conversely\na lower value of vstickleads to a steeper Schmidt law with a\nlower overall star formation rate. This behaviour is demon-\nstrated in Fig (4) for the one zone model. The value of vstick\nused to reproduce the Schmidt law slope and normalisation\nin the one zone model also works in the simulated galaxy\nand the observed galaxy follows the observed Schmidt law\nvery closely throughout its whole lifetime (figure (15)).\nThe resolution independence of the star formation pre-\nscription is once again demonstrated by Fig (16). The star\nformation rate between the highest and lowest mass resolu-\ntion simulations is in remarkably good agreement. The gen-\neral form followed by all simulations is that there is a strong\nburst of star formation at the initial time, this is rapidly\nquenched by supernova feedback, and a self-regulating ISM\nis set up. The star formation rate slowly increases as the gas\nin the galactic disk is either used up or ejected in the form\nof winds.\nRecent observations of the gas content of the MW have\nallowed the construction of maps of its gas surface density\n(Levine et al (2006)). In order to compare the properties of\nour model to observations, another GalactICs model was\ngenerated with properties as close as possible to those of\nthe MW. The total mass of the galactic disk was set to\n5\u00d7 1010M\u2299, and the scale radius of the exponential disk to\n4.5kpc. This simulation was evolved for 1Gyr. The resulting\ngas distribution is shown in Fig (17). Our simulations are in\ngood agreement with the observations of Levine et al (2006).\nThese properties suggest that the star formation and\nfeedback prescriptions behave well in a quiescent disk, a\nmore robust test of how they perform in a more general\nsituation is given by the rotating collapse simulations.\n5.2 Rotating Collapse\n5.2.1 Simulation Details\nThe second simulation we investigate is the collapse of a ro-\ntating spherical halo (Navarro & White (1993)) with an ini-\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 17\nFigure 12.

The mass of the rotating\nsphere is 1\u00d7 1012M\u2299 and its initial radius is 100kpc. Veloc-\nities are chosen such that the sphere is initially rotating as\na solid body with a spin parameter of 0.1. Once again this\nsimulation is created at three different mass resolutions, cor-\nresponding to dark matter particle masses of 5.2 \u00d7 108M\u2299,\n5.8\u00d7 107M\u2299 and 2.0\u00d7 107M\u2299, with corresponding gravita-\ntional softenings of 1.93kpc, 0.96kpc and 0.68kpc. The rotat-\ning collapse simulations model, in a crude way, the collapse\nof a protogalaxy, and allow us to investigate how the ISM\nmodel behaves when it is initially far from equilibrium and\nin situations with strong shocks and rapid density changes.\n5.2.2 The Base Simulations\nAfter 2Gyr the density profiles of each of the three phases\nof matter are shown in Fig (18) and Fig (19). The density\nprofiles are averaged around the disk; each radial bin repre-\nsents a ring centered on the centre of mass of the disk. Figure\n(18) shows the radial density profiles of both the ambient\nand molecular gas. The three different resolution simulations\nonce again behave in very similar ways. Fig (19) shows the\nradial density profile of stellar mass, demonstrating that our\nstar formation prescription gives rise to an exponential disk\nand a bulge component well fitted by the standard r1\/4 law.\nThe rotating collapse simulations are especially inter-\nesting because they start far from equilibrium and so fea-\n18 C.

In the\nfinal time plot region a contains gas in the halo of the galaxy. Region b is gas in the disk of the galaxy, which reaches an equilibrium\ntemperature of \u223c 104K and c represents the approximate position of the molecular clouds, at an assumed temperature of 100K. The\ngas in the halo consists both of gas that failed to cool on to the disk, and gas that was originally in the disk but has been heated by\nsupernovae. Approximately 45% of the mass is in the two hot phases, 40% in the disk and 15% in the cold molecular clouds.\ntures that arise in the final particle distribution are purely\nan effect of the physics in the simulation and not just set up\nby hand in the initial conditions. Fig (20) shows how the\nmolecular fraction (the ratio of the mass in molecular hy-\ndrogen to the mass in atomic hydrogen) varies as a function\nof distance from the centre. Observational data from M31\n(Dame et al (1993)) is included as a comparison.\nThe evolution of the thermal properties of the halo are\nshown in Fig (21). In its initial state all the gas in the\nhalo is cold. As the halo collapses it becomes dense and is\nshock heated. The gas that ends up in the disk comes to\nan equilibrium between radiative cooling and the heating\ndue to SNe at approximately 104K and a halo of hot, SN\nheated gas at \u223c 106K is gradually formed. The addition\nof the molecular gas (T \u223c 100K, \u03c1 \u223c 100 \u2212 1000cm\u22123)\nforms an ISM with four phases: shocked halo gas, SNe heated\nmaterial, cold molecular clouds and warm disk gas. The first\ntwo components are hard to distinguish on the \u03c1\u2212 T plot.\nBlitz & Rosolowsky (2006) have argued that the ratio\nof molecular to atomic gas in galaxies, Rmol, is determined\nby hydrostatic pressure and through observations of nearby\ngalaxies found the following relation:\nRmol =\nh Pext\/kB\n(3.5\u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 104\ni0.92\u00b10.07\n, (27)\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 19\nFigure 14.

The top panel shows\nthe perpendicular distance from the centre of the stellar disk, the\ncentral panel shows the entropy of each particle and the lower\npanel the cumulative amount of thermal energy that has been\ndumped into the particle. It is clear that some particles with a\nhigher entropy are lifted away from the galactic disk where they\ncool and rain back down on the galactic disk within a hundred\nMyr of being supernova heated. Other particles are ejected vio-\nlently from the galaxy, their density becomes very low and they\nevolve adiabatically.\nwhere Pext is an estimate of the mid-plane pressure.

We use\nthe SPH estimate of the pressure at z = 0. To calculate Rmol\nwe use all matter within a vertical distance of 1kpc from the\ncentre of mass of the disk and bin radially. The model of the\nISM clearly reproduces the observed behaviour.\n5.3 Away From the Base Model\nThe determination of some of the physical parameters used\nin our model is somewhat uncertain. In this section we in-\nvestigate the effect of varying some of the physics included\nin the models. Large uncertainties are present in the de-\nFigure 15.

In addition our simulations\ndo not contain a detailed treatment of metals. We demon-\nstrate the effects of changing each of these parameters on\nthe large scale properties of simulated quiescent disks.\nThe value of E51 may differ greatly from unity, for ex-\nample due to radiative cooling of the SN remnant. We in-\nvestigate the effect of moving E51 away from unity and also\nlook at changing the physics included in our analytic model\nfor blast wave evolution, firstly by extending the simple Se-\n20 C.

It is clear that\neven starting from an initial condition far from equilibrium we\ngenerate a stellar disk with a surface density profile similar to\nthat in observed galaxies.\nFigure 20.

Secondly, the gas disk in simulations\nwith higher supernova efficiency is found to be less centrally\nconcentrated; the reverse is also true in simulations with a\nlow supernova efficiency. This is a result of supernova feed-\nback ejecting gas from the galactic disk more efficiently in\nthe runs with a high value of E51. We find that the fiducial\nvalue of E51 = 1.0 provides a good match with the observed\nproperties of disk galaxies.\nMore accurate modelling of the evolution of supernova\nblast waves (by using the Tang & Wang (2005) fit to the\nblast wave evolution) does not significantly change the prop-\nerties of the galaxy. Assuming that a typical supernova rem-\nnant expands for approximately \u223c0.3 Myr before being dis-\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 21\nFigure 22.

The dotted line represents the observational\nresult (Eq (27))due to Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006). The simulated\ngalaxy is in good agreement with observation.\npersed, that the mean ambient temperature of the ISM is\n106 K and the mean density is 10\u22122 atoms per cm3 then\nthe difference in the blast wave radius between the pure Se-\ndov solution (10) and the modified fitting formula due to\nTang & Wang (2005) (Eq (11)) is never more than 20%.\nThis is demonstrated in Fig 2, which shows a pure Sedov\nblast wave compared with the simulated result from an SPH\nsimulation of a blast wave in a hot (106K) medium.\nThe net result of having larger blast waves is that the\nporosity of the ISM increases at a greater rate and the delay\nbetween a supernova explosion occurring and its thermal\nenergy being injected into the ambient medium is decreased.\nFinally we can switch off the radiative cooling in super-\nnova remnants. The effects here are much more dramatic. In\nthe dense galactic disk a supernova remnant can typically\nradiate away over 90% of its thermal energy before being\ndisrupted. Switching off radiative cooling in supernova rem-\nnants, therefore, has a very severe effect in our galaxy sim-\nulations, and leads to the almost immediate suppression of\nstar formation and much of the material in the galactic disk\nis ejected from the galaxy. This demonstrates that radiative\nlosses from supernova remnants are of crucial importance in\nour models.\nOur simulation code does not contain a detailed descrip-\ntion of mass feedback from supernovae. Therefore we need\nto verify that the expected evolution in metallicity over the\ntimescale of the simulation will not substantially affect the\nproperties of the galactic disk.\nFollowing Harfst, Theis & Hensler (2006) we use a sim-\nple analytic model to estimate the change in metallicity over\nthe timescale of a typical simulation then run simulations\nwith metallicites bracketing this range. By assuming that\nstars form at a constant rate of 1M\u2299\/yr, that there is one\ntype 2 supernova event per 125M\u2299 of stars formed, and\nusing metal yields due to Woosley & Weaver (1995) we es-\ntimate that over the 1Gyr timespan of one of the quiescent\ndisk simulations the average metallicity of the galaxy should\nnot change by more than 0.04Z\u2299.\nThe base simulations have a metallicity of 1.0Z\u2299, two\nadditional simulations were run with metallicities of 0.5Z\u2299\nand 1.5Z\u2299, far outside the metallicity evolution range ex-\npected in our quiescent disks. The total amount of stars af-\nter 1Gyr in the high metallicity run is 5% higher than in the\nbase run. The low metallicity run contains approximately\n5% less stars than the base run. This trend arises because\nthe radiative cooling rate of the ambient phase is related to\nthe ambient gas metallicity. All the properties of the three\nsimulated disks agree to within 10% with the properties of\nthe base simulations. The reason for the surprisingly small\ndependence of the galaxy properties on the metallicity of\nthe gas is that in the quiescent disk the gas is maintained\nat a temperature of \u223c 104K. At this temperature the ra-\ndiative cooling function does not change very much with\nmetallicity. We do, however, note that a full treatment of\nthe metal enrichment of the gas is necessary in perform-\ning fully cosmological simulations since here the metallicity\nof the gas may significantly affect the way in which it col-\nlapses (e.g. Scannapieco et al (2005)). In these simulations\nwe have additionally neglected the change in stellar lifetime\nwith metallicity (see e.g. Raiteri, Villata & Navarro (1996)).\nSince we are simulating a quiescent disk, it is not expected\nthat changes to the lifetimes of massive stars will have a\nlarge effect on the properties of the galactic disk.\nHowever, as noted by Harfst, Theis & Hensler (2006) a\ndetailed prescription for the yields from supernovae is nec-\nessary if we want to simulate the early evolution of a galaxy.\nOne of the most poorly constrained parameters is the ef-\nficiency of evaporation of molecular clouds through thermal\nconduction. Magnetic fields and turbulence may affect the\namount of thermal conduction by a large amount (MO77).\nWe ran quiescent disk simulations with the efficiency of ther-\nmal conduction moved by a factor of five in each direction\n(GAL BASE LOCON; GAL BASE HICON). More efficient\nthermal conduction leads to a lower density of molecular\nclouds in the galactic disk, as well as making the cloud mass\nfunction more shallow. The star formation rates are affected\nby a similar amount, in the simulations with a high ther-\nmal conduction rate the star formation rate is depressed by\nan order of magnitude. As discussed in section 5.2 the base\nvalue for the thermal conduction efficiency reproduces many\nof the observed properties of the MW.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nMotivated by the fact that we cannot reasonably resolve\nthe Jeans scale for molecular clouds in galaxy simulations\nwe have introduced a new star formation and feedback pre-\nscription. We model the ambient phase of the ISM using a\nhydrodynamic simulation code and the unresolved molecu-\nlar gas using a sticky particle prescription. Our model leads\nto a tightly self-regulating multiphase ISM. The multiphase\nnature of our star formation prescription avoids a lot of\nthe problems of overcooling that were present in the first\ngeneration of star formation models. With the exception of\nthe parameter that controls the molecular cloud coagula-\ntion timescale, vstick, all the parameters in our model can\nbe tightly constrained by observation, leaving the cloud co-\nagulation timescale as a free parameter that we can adjust\nto match the observed properties of galaxies. Where pos-\nsible our model of the ISM has been formulated in such a\n22 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\nway that the results of a simulation should be independent of\nmass resolution. We demonstrated that the large scale prop-\nerties of our simulations were unchanged over a two orders\nof magnitude shift in mass resolution.\nWe have applied the sticky particle star formation\nmodel to three different types of simulation: a simple one\nzone model, the rotating collapse of a gas and dark matter\nsphere and a model of a quiescent galactic disk. After using\nthe one zone simulation to set the value of the parameters\nthat cannot be determined observationally, the sticky par-\nticle model can be applied to the other simulations without\nany parameter changes.\nThe simulations of a quiescent disk galaxy reproduce\nthe observed Schmidt law with a slope of 1.4 due to the\nopposing effects of cloud coagulation and feedback effects.\nThe galaxy also developed a natural three component ISM.\nFinally we observe supernova heated gas in the galaxy being\nejected from the disk either in the form of a galactic fountain,\nor, when the star formation rate (and associated supernova\nrate) is sufficient, in the form of strong bipolar outflows.\nBoth of these results arise as a natural consequence of the\nphysics included in our star formation prescription.\nSimulations of the collapse of a rotating sphere of dark\nmatter and gas reproduced, many of the observed proper-\nties of galactic disks, beginning from an initial condition\nwell out of equilibrium. In particular we observe a stellar\ndisk with distinct bulge and disk components, well fitted by\nthe standard exponential and de Vacouleurs density profiles.\nThe fraction of molecular gas in the disk as a function of ra-\ndius is reproduced, and agrees well with recent observations\nof nearby galaxies. The observed relation between the disk\nmidplane pressure and the fraction of molecular clouds is\nalso reproduced. We also observe star formation rates com-\nparable to those in disk galaxies and note that our model\nreproduces the formation of stars in the spiral arms of the\ngalaxy.\nOur preferred values for most of the parameters are dis-\ncussed in section 4; and are usually constrained by observa-\ntion. We varied the values of those parameters that are only\nweakly constrained and foind that our preferred value of\nE51 = 1 find that we obtain reasonable results. Including\ndifferent physical descriptions of the evolution of supernova\nblast waves makes only a modest difference to our results.\nFinally we note that in the quiescent disk simulation our re-\nsults depend relatively weakly on metallicity; although this\nwill not be the case in fully cosmological simulations, for\nwhich a full treatment of metal enrichment via supernova\nfeedback is necessary.\nA natural continuation of this work is to extend our in-\nvestigations to higher redshift through the use of fully cos-\nmological simulations, and to explore the behaviour of the\nISM in colliding galaxies. This work is currently being pur-\nsued.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCB and TT thank PPARC for the award of a research stu-\ndentship, and an Advanced Fellowship, respectively.

Clouds\nof mass m may merge with clouds of any other mass to\ndecrease the number of clouds of mass m. Finally clouds of\nmass m can interact gravitationally with any other clouds,\nthus losing kinetic energy. These three processes are termed\ngain, loss and cooling.\nGain processes may be represented in the following way,\nwhere we have integrated overm\u2032 such that the two particles\nthat merge have masses that sum to m\nE\u02d9gain =\nZ \u221e\n0\nZ v1=\u221e\nv1=\u2212\u221e\nZ v2=v1+vstick\nv2=v1\u2212vstick\nh\nP (v1)P (v2)n(m\n\u2032, t)\nn(m\u2212m\u2032, t)K(m\u2032, m\u2212m\u2032)fm(m\u2032,m\u2212m\u2032)Ef\ni\ndv2dv1dm\n\u2032 . (B4)\nP (v1) and P (v1) are the probability distributions velocities\nv1 and v2 and are assumed to be gaussian with standard\ndeviation \u03c31 and \u03c32 respectively. , Ef represents the final\nkinetic energy of a collision between particles of masses m\u2032\nand m\u2212m\u2032. Ef is evaluated by considering conservation of\nmomentum,\nEf =\n1\n2\n(m\u2032v1 + (m\u2212m\u2032)v2)2\nm2\n. (B5)\nEq (B4) then becomes\nE\u02d9gain =\nn(m\u2032, t)\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2212m\u2032, t)K(m\u2032,m\u2212m\u2032)\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nZ v1+vstick\nv1\u2212vstick\n1\n\u03c3m\u2032\u03c3m\u2212m\u2032\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv1\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\n\u2032\n\u201d\n2\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv2\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\u2212m\u2032\n\u201d\n2\n1\n2\n\u201c (m\u2032v1 + (m\u2212m\u2032)v2)2\nm\n\u201d\ndv2dv1dm\n\u2032 , (B6)\nMolecular cloud regulated star formation in galaxies 25\nand Eq (B6) may be written\nE\u02d9gain =\nn(m\u2032, t)\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2212m\u2032, t)K(m\u2032,m\u2212m\u2032)\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u03c3m\u2032\u03c3m\u2212m\u2032\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv1\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\n\u2032\n\u201d\n2\nZ v1+vstick\nv1\u2212vstick\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv2\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\u2212m\u2032\n\u201d\n2\n1\n2\n\u201c (m\u2032v1 + (m\u2212m\u2032)v2)2\nm\n\u201d\ndv2dv1dm\n\u2032 (B7)\nThe total kinetic energy of particles of mass m may also\nbe decreased by mergers between particles of mass m and\nany other mass (the second process in the list). Similarly to\nEq (B6), the rate of energy loss may be written\nE\u02d9loss =\nn(m, t)\n2\u03c0Z \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2032, t)K(m,m\u2032)\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u03c3m\u03c3m\u2032\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv1\u221a\n2\u03c3m\n\u201d\n2\nZ v1+vstick\nv1\u2212vstick\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv2\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\n\u2032\n\u201d\n2\nmv21\n2\ndv2dv1dm\n\u2032 . (B8)\nFinally, the total energy of particles with massm may be de-\ncreased by collisions between particles of mass m and parti-\ncles of any other mass that occur at relative velocities greater\nthan vstick. In this case, the velocity of both particles is de-\ncreased by a factor \u03b7 relative to the centre of mass. For a\ncollision between particles of masses m1 and m2 (velocities\nv1 and v2) the final velocity of particle 1 (denoted v\n\u2032\n1) is\nevaluated by conservation of momentum\nv\u20321 =\u03b7(v1 \u2212 vcom) + vcom\nvcom =\nm1v1 +m2v2\nm1 +m2\n\u2206E =\n1\n2\nm1v\n\u20322\n1 \u2212 1\n2\nm1v\n2\n1 , (B9)\nUsing these definitions, the change in energy of a particle\nof mass m1 by gravitational cooling with a particle of mass\nm2, denoted \u01eb is given by\n\u01eb =\nm1\n2\nh\nv21(1\u2212 \u03b12)\u2212 v22\u03b22 \u2212 v1v2\u03b1\u03b2\ni\n, (B10)\nwhere\n\u03b1 = \u03b7 +\nm1\nm1 +m2\n(1\u2212 \u03b7) (B11)\n\u03b2 =\nm2\nm1 +m2\n(1\u2212 \u03b7) . (B12)\nIn a similar way to Eq (B6) the energy loss via this process\nmay be written\nE\u02d9cool =\nn(m, t)\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2032, t)K(m,m\u2032)\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u03c3m\u03c3m\u2032\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv1\u221a\n2\u03c3m\n\u201d\n2\nZ |v1\u2212v2|>vstick\n\u01ebe\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv2\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\n\u2032\n\u201d\n2\ndv2dv1dm\n\u2032 . (B13)\nAPPENDIX C: THE SOLUTION OF THE\nCOAGULATION EQUATIONS\nIn our simulations we solve the discrete versions of Eq (B3),\nEq (5) and Eq (6), where by assuming that cloud mass is\nquantised into N bins characterised by an index, i, where\nMi = iM0 we can write\nn\u02d9k =\n1\n2V\nX\ni+j=k\nKijf\nm\nij ninj \u2212 nk\nV\njmaxX\nj=1\nKjkf\nm\nij nj , (C1)\nE\u02d9k = E\u02d9gain \u2212 E\u02d9loss \u2212 E\u02d9cool, (C2)\n\u03c3\u02d9k =\nE\u02d9k \u2212 12\u03c32kMkn\u02d9k\n\u03c3knkMk\n, (C3)\nwhere subscripts represent different mass bins. Kij \u2261\nK(Mi,Mj) \u2261 K(iM0, kM0). The superscript m represents\nthat f is a cross section for particle mergers\nTo demonstrate the technique for solving these equa-\ntions we will consider the numerical solution of the simple\nSmoluchowski (Eq (B1)), which when written in a discrete\nform takes on the following form\nn\u02d9i =\n1\n2V\ni\u22121X\nj=1\nnjni\u2212jKij \u2212 ni\nV\nNX\nj=1\nnjKij . (C4)\nFollowing Benson, Kamionkowski & Hassani (2005) Eq\n(C4) can be rewritten in the form of a matrix equation\nn\u02d9 = B \u00b7 k, (C5)\nthe vector k has N \u00d7 N elements corresponding to\nK(mi,mj). The kernel matrix, B has N \u00d7N \u00d7N elements\nand may be written more explicitly as\nn\u02d9i =\nX\njk\nBijkkjk, (C6)\nwhere\nBijk =\nnjnk\nV\n\u201c1\n2\n\u03b4i,j+k \u2212 \u03b4ik\n\u201d\n(C7)\n\u03b4 represents a Kronecker delta function. We solve Eq (C5)\nimplicitly using an iterative method.\nThe solution of the equations that govern energy ex-\nchange between clouds (Eq (B7), Eq (B8) and Eq (B13))\nis the same as for the solution of the Smoluchowski equation\nin that we will write the equations in the form of the linear\nmultiplication of two matrices and then solve this equation\nimplicitly. In order to simplify the notation in this section\nwe will denote the terms in the three equations that are in-\nside of the integrals over velocity as \u03be. Explicitly for the case\nof the equation for energy gain (Eq (B7)):\n\u03beG(m,m\u2032) =\n1\n2\u03c0\nZ \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u03c3m\u03c3m\u2032\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv1\u221a\n2\u03c3m\n\u201d\n2\nZ v1+vstick\nv1\u2212vstick\n1\n2\ne\n\u2212\n\u201c\nv2\u221a\n2\u03c3\nm\n\u2032\n\u201d\n2\u201c (mv1 +m\u2032v2)2\nm\n\u201d\ndv2dv1\n(C8)\nThe corresponding terms in the equations for energy\nloss(B8) and cooling (B13) are denoted \u03beL(m1,m2) and\n26 C. M. Booth, Tom Theuns and Takashi Okamoto\n\u03beC(m1,m2) respectively. Note that the definitions of \u03be in-\nclude the factors of 2\u03c0 and 1\n\u03c3\nfrom throughout the equations.\nThe equation for the total evolution of the energy of a\nsystem of coagulating and cooling particles may be written\nin terms of these new functions as:\nE\u02d9(m) =\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2032, t)n(m\u2212m\u2032, t)K(m\u2032,m\u2212m\u2032)\u03beG(m\u2032,m\u2212m\u2032)dm\u2032\n\u2212 n(m, t)\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2032, t)K(m,m\u2032)\u03beL(m,m\u2032)dm\u2032\n\u2212 n(m, t)\nZ \u221e\n0\nn(m\u2032, t)K(m,m\u2032)\u03beC(m,m\u2032)dm\u2032 (C9)\nWhich when discretized and rearranged becomes\nE\u02d9i =\ni\u22121X\nj=1\nninjKij\u03be\nG\nij \u2212 ni\n\u201c NX\nj=1\nnjKij\n`\n\u03beCij + \u03be\nL\nij\n\u00b4\u201d\n(C10)\nThe subscripts represent different mass bins (nj \u2261 n(jM0)).\nOur goal is to rewrite Eq (C10) in the form of a linear\nmultiplication of two matrices\nE\u02d9 = C \u00b7 k, (C11)\nwhere k is defined in the same way in the solution of the\nSmoluchowski equation, that is: kij \u2261 K(mi,mj). The form\nof Cijk that is consistent with Eq (C10) is given by:\nCijk = njnk\n\u201c\n\u03b4i,j+k\u03be\nG\njk \u2212 \u03b4ik\n`\n\u03beCjk + \u03be\nL\njk\n\u00b4\u201d\n(C12)\nThis form for Cijk is functionally equivalent to Bijk (Eq\n(C7)) so the solution may proceed in exactly the same way\nas for the Smoluchowski equation, the only difference is the\nform of the matrix B\nThe calculation of the quantities \u03beG, \u03beC and \u03beL is com-\nputationally very expensive so they are initialised once into\na lookup table at the start of every simulation and obtained\nby bilinear interpolation thereafter.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX\/ LATEX file prepared\nby the author.\n"}
