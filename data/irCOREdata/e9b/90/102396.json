resource\nreservation (integrated services or IntServ), dif-\nferentiated forwarding (differentiated services or\nDiffServ), traffic engineering of routes (multi-\nprotocol label switching traffic eengineering or\nMPLS-TE) or simply through overprovisioning.\nThese approaches have focused mainly on the\nmeans of providing edge-to-edge performance\nguarantees within a single autonomous system\n(AS) or set of ASs under the control of one\nadministrative entity. Internet service scope,\nhowever, cannot be constrained by the bound-\naries of a single administration and it is in the\ninterests of all Internet network providers, ser-\nvice\/content providers, and their customers for\nthe scope of QoS-based services to be extended\nglobally, across multiple domains.\nThe problem of how to extend QoS capabili-\nties across multiple provider domains has not\nbeen solved satisfactorily to date. The source of\nthe problem lies mainly with the autonomous\nnature of ISPs and their loose federation1 that\nforms the global Internet. There is no central\nauthority or regulation compared to networks\nsuch as the Public Switched Telephone Network\nwhere the ITU-T specifies reference models and\nperformance targets so that end-to-end conver-\nsational voice quality is guaranteed.\nOur solution to the interdomain QoS prob-\nlem is tackled at two levels that mirror the busi-\nness model of today\u2019s best-effort Internet. First\nof all, an offline traffic engineering (TE) process\nin each provider domain decides with which\nneighbouring ASs to establish QoS bindings on\nthe basis of compatibility of intradomain QoS\ncapabilities (similar to per domain behaviours\n[1]). This is analogous to the decision of today\u2019s\nISPs with which ASs to establish peering or tran-\nsit relationships for best-effort traffic. But in the\ncase of QoS-based peering, additional agree-\nments are required in the form of interprovider\nservice-level specifications (SLSs) [2] that deter-\nmine the technical aspects of the QoS-based\nconnectivity services to be utilised, including the\nquantity, quality, and topological scope of the\ntraffic to be exchanged.\nThe second level of our interdomain QoS\nsolution is concerned with interdomain routing,\nand is focussed on QoS extensions to the Border\nGateway Protocol (BGP [3]). QoS-enhanced\nBGP (q-BGP) [4] conveys additional information\nrelating to the QoS of the paths it has selected\nto the destination prefixes that it announces.\nEnhanced route-selection processes are then\nable to establish appropriate interdomain routes\nso that traffic is forwarded according to the\nalready established, additional QoS agreements\nABSTRACT\nThis article presents an approach to deliver-\ning qualitative end-to-end quality of service\n(QoS) guarantees across the multiprovider Inter-\nnet. We propose that bilateral agreements\nbetween a number of autonomous systems (ASs)\nresult in the establishment of QoS-class planes\nthat potentially extend across the global Inter-\nnet. The deployment of a QoS-enhanced Border\nGateway Protocol (BGP) with different QoS-\nbased route selection policies in each of the\nplanes allows a range of interdomain QoS capa-\nbilities to coexist on the same network infra-\nstructure. The article presents simulation results\nshowing the benefits of the approach and dis-\ncusses aspects of the performance of QoS-\nenhanced BGP.\nQUALITY-OF-SERVICE-BASED ROUTING ALGORITHMS\nFOR HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS\nDavid Griffin, Jason Spencer, and Jonas Griem, University College London\nMohamed Boucadair and Pierrick Morand, France Telecom R&D\nMichael Howarth, Ning Wang, and George Pavlou, University of Surrey\nAbolghasem (Hamid) Asgari, Thales Research & Technology Ltd.\nPanos Georgatsos, Algonet S.A.\nInterdomain Routing through \nQoS-Class Planes\n1 The term loose federation is used with regard to the end-\nto-end treatment of packets.

Note that q-BGP sessions only\nexist between peers with which appropriate SLSs\nhave been established. In this way, q-BGP routes\nare constrained to follow the SLSs that have\nbeen previously established by the offline TE\nalgorithms. This also implies that those ASs who\ndo not wish to participate in exchanging QoS-\nbased traffic do not receive unwanted QoS infor-\nmation through BGP.\nWe believe that these two techniques \u2014\nestablishing interdomain QoS-class planes (later\nreferred to as m-QCs, or meta-QoS-Class)\nthrough offline TE mechanisms, coupled with\ndynamic optimisation of the route selection pro-\ncess through q-BGP \u2014 provide a lightweight\nmeans of enabling end-to-end QoS across multi-\nple domains.\nThe following section describes the concept\nof m-QC planes and we describe enhancements\nto BGP for QoS-based interdomain routing. We\npresent experimental results from simulations of\nq-BGP, demonstrating the effect of injecting\nQoS information into BGP and investigating the\neffect of different q-BGP route selection policies\non end-to-end network performance. Finally, we\npresent our conclusions and identifies aspects of\nfuture work.\nINTERDOMAIN QOS DELIVERY\nTHROUGH QOS-CLASS PLANES\nAchieving service differentiation across multiple\nASs is hindered by the lack of co-ordination\nbetween operators of different ASs. In order to\novercome this, we make use of the meta-QoS\nclass (m-QC) concept defined in [5]. Each m-QC\ndefines a qualitative QoS treatment across a\ndomain, without requiring a particular means for\nengineering it. This leaves each operator free to\nchoose its preferred method of engineering QoS,\nprovided that m-QC requirements are fulfilled.\nExamples of m-QCs could be a one-way transit\ndelay [6] of \u201cvery low\u201d and packet loss rate [7] of\n\u201cvery low,\u201d or a delay-sensitive m-QC with delay\nvalue of \u201clow\u201d and loss value of \u201cany.\u201d Unlike\nhard guaranteed QoS classes that are defined\nend-to-end with distinct performance character-\nistics, m-QCs do not imply a predefined\/engi-\nneered end-to-end-QoS.\nInterdomain m-QC planes are constructed by\nconcatenating the appropriate local QoS classes\nacross interdomain links, using well-known Diff-\nServ Code Point (DSCP) values to distinguish\nthe traffic belonging to different planes. Figure 1\nillustrates this concept, where the dashed lines\ncontained within each AS represent the local\ntreatment that adheres to an m-QC. Where an\nAS has not created a local class conformant to\nan m-QC, it may not join the corresponding\nplane as is the case for m-QC2 in AS 3 in the\nfigure, although it may still participate in other\nm-QC planes. Alternatively, it could participate\nin the m-QC plane with a local QoS class that\nexceeds the m-QC specification.\nSince the traffic belonging to m-QC planes is\ndifferentiated by the DSCP value at interdomain\nlinks, each m-QC plane can route packets inde-\npendently from one another with (an appropri-\nately enhanced) BGP to optimise for each\nm-QCs engineering target performance. For\ninstance, longer paths could be used for a non-\ndelay-sensitive m-QC if this helps with load bal-\nancing and the use of low-utilisation links. This\nnew ability to differentiate interdomain routing\nis the motivation for pursuing the QoS enhanced\nBGP that will be described in the next section.\nNote, however, that the mechanisms of multiple\nm-QC planes and differentiated interdomain\nrouting can also support other TE goals such as\nresilience and load balancing.\nIn order to establish the interdomain m-QC\nplanes the following steps need to take place:\n\u2022 Establishment of interprovider SLSs, to\nagree the exchange of traffic belonging to a\ncertain m-QC.\n\u2022 Identification of the traffic flows and q-BGP\nannouncements that fall into a particular\nm-QC. For traffic flows this is achieved at a\npacket level by using the DSCP field of the\nIP header and, in q-BGP, by means of a\nnewly defined QoS attribute. The identi-\nfiers could either be globally known or\nagreed between adjacent AS peers at the\ntime of SLS establishment.\n\u2022 Announcement of the network prefixes that\ncan be reached within each m-QC plane\nand associated optional QoS attributes.\nThis is achieved dynamically through q-\nBGP, as described in the next section.\n\u2022 DSCP swapping of data packets at each\ndomain\u2019s ingress and egress points. M-QC\ntraffic, when arriving at a domain, needs to\nbe marked appropriately to receive the rel-\nevant local treatment (as per local QoS\nclass engineered for the m-QC). When exit-\ning from a domain, m-QC traffic needs also\nto be remarked to the value agreed in the\nSLS with the adjacent domain for that m-\nQC.\nWhen traversing a set of ASs, the QoS treat-\nment experienced by an IP datagram is now con-\nsistent in the sense that packet treatment\nreceived in each AS conforms to the correspond-\ning m-QC.\nQOS-AWARE INTERDOMAIN\nROUTING: Q-BGP\nBGP is the most widely used interdomain rout-\ning protocol in the Internet for interconnecting\nadjacent ASs carrying best-effort traffic. Several\nproposals (e.g., [8] and [9]) have been made to\nextend the information conveyed by BGP. The\nenhancements specified below do not require\nany changes to the BGP state machine but allow\nn Figure 1.

It is an optional parameter of the\nOPEN message and it allows peering entities to\nlearn about each other\u2019s QoS service capabilities,\nas previously agreed offline in the SLS. The\nparameter indicates the additional QoS informa-\ntion to be carried by q-BGP messages, depending\non the category to which an offered interdomain\nQoS delivery solution belongs as follows:\nCategory one: An additional QoS Class iden-\ntifier is exchanged in q-BGP messages, specify-\ning the m-QC plane agreed in the SLS. QoS\ntreatment characteristics need not be exchanged\nby q-BGP explicitly as they are standardised for\nthe m-QC.\nCategory two: Both the m-QC plane identifier\nand the values of the associated QoS perfor-\nmance metrics are exchanged by q-BGP. For this\ncategory, the set of QoS attribute types is agreed\nduring the SLS negotiation phase. The values of\nQoS performance metrics may be assigned either\nstatically, by an administrator, or dynamically\nobtained through measurements. The way these\nvalues are set by the originator of the announce-\nment is up to the domains\u2019 administrators and\/or\nmutual agreement between AS peers.\nQoS_NLRI is used to convey QoS-related\ninformation in UPDATE messages. Multiple\nQoS performance characteristics may be con-\nveyed in a single QoS_NLRI attribute. It should\nbe noted that both QoS Service Capability and\nQoS_NLRI attributes are optional, nontransitive.\nROUTE SELECTION PROCESS\nThe q-BGP route selection process should take\ninto account the QoS-related information con-\nveyed in the QoS_NLRI attribute of q-BGP\nUPDATE messages in order to select an appro-\npriate route.2 The process is a modified version\nof the classical BGP route selection process with\nUPDATE messages being filtered by m-QC\nplane identifier so that decisions are only made\non announcements belonging to that m-QC\nplane. In addition to determining the AS\u2019s m-\nQC plane participation through prior SLS estab-\nlishment, offline TE may further influence the\nq-BGP decisions through the optional configura-\ntion of LOCAL_PREF values to override\ndynamic q-BGP decisions based on QoS infor-\nmation. If more than one route has the highest\nLOCAL_PREF the subsequent selection process\ndiffers according to the category of interdomain\nQoS delivery solution, as explained above.\nCategory one (QoS-Class-identifier only):\nThe q-BGP route selection process will choose\nthe route that minimises the AS_PATH length\nfor each m-QC plane since, in the absence of\nadditional QoS attributes, this strategy has a\ngood chance of maximizing end-to-end QoS\nwhen crossing ASes supporting the same m-QC.\nCategory two (QoS-Class-identifier and addi-\ntional QoS information): since several QoS\nparameters may be advertised per destination\nprefix in each m-QC plane, the process prioritises\nthe QoS parameters (the parameters and their\npriority depend on the m-QC specification).\nThus, the route selection process chooses the\nbest routes by initially examining the highest-pri-\nority QoS parameter. If several routes have the\nsame value (or are within an acceptable margin\nto be considered equivalent), the second priority\nparameter is considered, and so on until a route\nis selected. If more than one route remains, then\nselection is based on AS_PATH length.\nAs an example, suppose that a q-BGP router\nhas received the following routes from several\npeers for reaching the same prefix P1. Each of\nthese routes is associated with a set of QoS per-\nformance values, as shown in Table 1.\nIf the q-BGP router is configured to priori-\ntize the one-way delay metric, the selected route\nwill be R3. But if the q-BGP router is configured\nto prioritise the one-way loss rate metric, the\nselected route will be R2.\nQ-BGP SIMULATIONS AND\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn this section we demonstrate the performance\ngains achieved by q-BGP. Our simulation tools\nare event driven, using traffic models to approxi-\nmate the QoS experienced by flows, including\ndelivered bandwidth and delay due to congestion\nand propagation times. The first part of this sec-\ntion is a comparison of the impact of different q-\nBGP selection policies on delivered end-to-end\ntraffic performance followed by an examination of\nthe QoS improvement and scalability of q-BGP at\nbigger network sizes. Each simulation run consid-\ners a single m-QC plane and, therefore, the set of\nexperiments models the case in which there is a\nhard reservation of interdomain link capacity for\neach SLS and each m-QC plane makes indepen-\ndent routing decisions through q-BGP.\nCOMPARISON OF Q-BGP SELECTION POLICIES\nIn this section we examine the relative perfor-\nmance of a range of different q-BGP selection\npolicies in terms of their impact on the delivered\ndelay and throughput on end-to-end flows. In\nn Table 1.

However, we have chosen a single-path\napproach for simplicity at this stage.\nIf several routes have\nthe same value \n(or are within an\nacceptable margin to\nbe considered \nequivalent), the \nsecond priority\nparameter is \nconsidered, and so\non until a route is\nselected. If more\nthan one route\nremains, then \nselection is based on\nAS_PATH length.\nGRIFFIN LAYOUT  1\/22\/07  12:07 PM  Page 90\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 February 2007 91\nthese experiments we concentrate on two QoS\nAttributes (QAs):\nOne-Way Delay (DELAYQA) QoS Attribute:\nThe expected time for a packet to reach the pre-\nfix advertised. When traversing ASs and interdo-\nmain links, this value is formed through the\nconcatenation of the various delay contributors:\nAdvertised DELAYQA = incoming adver-\ntisement DELAYQA + local QoS class\ndelay + SLS queuing delay;\nwhere local QoS class delay is the edge-to-\nedge delay across the current AS and SLS\nqueuing delay is that introduced over the\ninterdomain link with the AS from which\nthe advertisement was received.\nBandwidth (BWQA) QoS Attribute: The\nbandwidth available to the prefix specified in the\nNLRI field. Local QoS classes are assumed to\nhave sufficient bandwidth assigned3 so the only\nrestriction is the SLS capacity, thus the value\nadvertised becomes:\nAdvertised BWQA = min (incoming\nadvertisement BWQA, offered SLS\ncapacity);\nwhere offered SLS capacity is a portion of\nthe bandwidth allocated to the m-QC on\nthe interdomain link with the AS from\nwhich the advertisement was received.\nThroughout the experiments we examine a\nnumber of route selection policies which make\nuse of various combinations of QoS attributes.\nFor added variability of policies we also use a\nQoS attribute equivalence margin. This margin\neffectively introduces a comparison granularity\nto QoS attributes.\nIn the following simulation runs, QA equiva-\nlence is calculated by:\nif( floor( MessageA_QA\/QAmargin ) =\nfloor( MessageB_QA\/QAmargin ) )\nthen the incoming message QAs (MessageA_QA\nand MessageB_QA) are equivalent and the deci-\nsion must be performed on the next metric. For\nexample, applying a one-way delay equivalence\nmargin of 70 ms to the example in Table 1, R2\nand R3 are equivalent with regards to one-way\ndelay. With a margin of 90 ms, R1, R2, and R3\nare equivalent.\nAlthough results were obtained for many\ncases of equivalence margin value, for clarity the\ncomparison graph concentrates on results from a\nmore limited set of values, selected to highlight\nthe major differences between the selection poli-\ncies.\nThe route selection processes examined here\nare explained below. Note that we are investigat-\ning the performance of the dynamic q-BGP\nroute selection process here rather than investi-\ngating an administratively set routing policy;\ntherefore, LOCAL_PREF values are assumed to\nbe the same for all routes.\n\u2022 M-QC identifier only: routing decisions\nwithin the m-QC plane are based first on\nAS Path length, and use ASN (AS number)\nas a tie breaker. Given that the simulations\nfocus on a single m-QC plane these tests\nare effectively without any additional QoS\ninformation injected into q-BGP and are\ntherefore equivalent to classical BGP. This\npolicy is denoted as MCIDONLY.\n\u2022 Single QoS attributes of either DELAYQA-\nonly or BWQA-only: the routing decision is\nperformed based on the QoS attribute first\n(within the boundaries of the QAmargin),\nand then on AS path length and ASN.\nThese policies are denoted as\nDELAYQAONLY and BWQAONLY.\n\u2022 A two-level priority scheme where, depend-\ning on the priorities specified in the policy,\neither one of DELAYQA or BWQA is\nchecked first, and then if found equivalent\n(depending on the bandwidth (BW) and\none-way-delay (DEL) parameters and mar-\ngins) the other QA is checked. If that, too,\nis equivalent the decision is the based on\nAS path length and the ASN. These poli-\ncies are denoted as PRI_BW-s_DEL-t for\nwhen BWQA has a higher priority than\nDELAYQA, and PRI_DEL-t_BW-s when\nDELAYQA has a higher priority than\nBWQA. The s denotes BWQA equivalence\nmargin parameter and t the DELAYQA\nequivalence margin.\nTo provide realistic and useful SLS capacities\nfor simulation purposes, a SLS capacity genera-\ntor was used in these experiments to provide a\nbase-line SLS capacity matrix in which one rout-\ning configuration is capable of satisfying the\ninput traffic demand exactly. To avoid favouring\nshortest-path routing strategies, the SLS capacity\ngenerator allocates capacity to interdomain links\non routes that do not always follow the shortest\npath. It would be very difficult for any routing\nheuristic to find the precise (non-shortest-path)\nrouting configuration that was used to generate\nthe SLS capacity matrix. An SLS scaling factor is\nthen used to scale the capacities. Scaling the\ncapacities is equivalent to overprovisioning\nabove the original base-line capacity matrix. The\nnumber of paths with available resources increas-\nes with the scaling factor and it becomes easier\nfor the routing policy to find a suitable routing\nconfiguration. The performance of different q-\nBGP selection policies can be compared by\nexamining the SLS scaling factor required to\nachieve equivalent end-to-end QoS.\nWhile there are no truly representative Inter-\nnet-like topology generators, the BRITE\nBarabasi\u2013Albert (BA) model (http:\/\/\nwww.cs.bu.edu\/brite\/) was used to generate the\ntest topologies. This creates power-law compli-\nant topologies when its preferential attachment\noption is used, and it has been shown that the\nInternet is also a power-law compliant topology\nat the AS level [10]. Network sizes (number of\nASs) of 100 were used in the following simula-\ntion experiments. Since we wanted to see the\neffect of q-BGP policies on end-to-end perfor-\nmance, a simple M\/M\/1 queuing model was used\nto approximate the effect on delivered QoS of\nqueuing delays at interdomain links. It was also\nassumed that all demands were inelastic. The\nmeasurements taken are the delivered end-to-\nend one-way delay (the sum of local QoS class\ndelays across each AS, interdomain link queuing\nand propagation delays) and the mean delivered\n3 SLS agreements between ASs imply that each AS under-\ntakes to engineer its local resources to honor the QoS and\ntraffic quantity clauses for the m-QC.\nWe examine a\nnumber of route\nselection policies\nwhich make use of\nvarious combinations\nof QoS attributes.\nFor added variability\nof policies we also\nuse a QoS attribute\nequivalence margin.\nThis margin\neffectively introduces\na comparison\ngranularity to QoS\nattributes.\nGRIFFIN LAYOUT  1\/22\/07  12:07 PM  Page 91\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Throughout\nthese experiments the values of QoS attributes\npropagated were based on static predefined val-\nues, and not on dynamic or measured values.\nFigure 2 shows a scatter plot of mean deliv-\nered delay against mean delivered bandwidth\nfraction for a range of q-BGP route selection\npolicies. The results are shown for three SLS\nscaling factors of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 \u2014 the three\npoints that run from left to right on each of the\ncurves.\nSINGLE QOS ATTRIBUTE Q-BGP POLICY:\nBANDWIDTH\nThe policy of selection based on BWQA-only\nwith no equivalence margin (2) delivers higher\nbandwidth fractions than MCID-only for higher\nSLS scaling factors, but performs worse than\nMCID-only in congested networks (i.e., low SLS\nscaling factor). The reason for the latter is due\nto a phenomenon that we call QA-rush: where\nresources (ASs, interdomain links) with the high-\nest advertised QoS (e.g., high capacity, or low\ndelay) are selected more often than those with\ninferior QoS attribute values, resulting in a\ngreater load on those resources, potentially satu-\nrating them and increasing delivered queuing\ndelays and packet loss.\nIn all cases the adoption of the BWQA-only\npolicy shows worse delivered delay than MCID-\nonly, since it selects the largest capacity route at\nany cost, causing increased congestion and\ngreater queuing delays. As the QA values are\nstatic and administratively set, they do not\nchange to reflect this saturation, and conse-\nquently the overall performance suffers.\nBy adding a margin of equivalence (e.g., of\n125 bandwidth units as shown for the\nBWQAONLY-125 (3) curve), the performance\nis improved in terms of both delivered delay and\nbandwidth when compared to selection based on\nthe absolute widest path (2). This also out-per-\nforms MCID-only (1) in terms of delivered\nbandwidth fraction but not delay. The policy of\nusing an equivalence margin improves perfor-\nmance by increasing the number of equivalent\nbandwidth paths and allowing route selection\nwithin the set of best bandwidth paths to be\ndone on the basis of the AS path length, thereby\nadding diversity to the overall routing behaviour.\nSINGLE QOS ATTRIBUTE Q-BGP POLICY: DELAY\nThe policy of selection based on DELAYQA-\nonly (4) shows negligible improvement over\nselection based on shortest AS path (MCID-\nonly) in terms of delay and only marginal\nimprovement in terms of delivered bandwidth.\nOne of the reasons for this is that in the simula-\ntion scenarios \u2014 as in the real world \u2014 the\nshortest AS path is often the one with shortest\ndelay. If the simulated inter-AS topology were\nselected carefully so that the ASs along shortest-\npath routes had large local QoS-class delays then\na more marked improvement in performance of\nthe DELAYQA-only selection policy might be\nobserved. This is also why there is little differ-\nence in the results of DELAYQA-only with and\nwithout an equivalence margin: (4) and (5),\nrespectively.\nTWO LEVEL PRIORITY Q-BGP POLICY\nThe best performing route selection policies are\nthose that select paths according to both adver-\ntised delay and bandwidth. PRI_DEL-100_BW-\n75 (6) is first of all selecting paths on the grounds\nof smallest advertised delay, with a margin of\nequivalence of 100 ms, and subsequently select-\ning between these on the basis of widest adver-\ntised bandwidth with a margin of equivalence of\n75 bandwidth units, falling back on AS path\nlength and finally AS number if a tie breaker is\nrequired. This policy delivers the best overall\nperformance in terms of bandwidth and delay at\nall three SLS scaling factors.\nIt is interesting to compare PRI_DEL-\n100_BW-75 (6) to PRI_BW-75_DEL-100 (7) \u2014\nthat is, the same bandwidth and delay margins,\nbut with the priority reversed. In the latter case\n(7), both delivered bandwidth and delay are\nworse than the former (6) and worse than selec-\ntion based on BWQA-only with a wider margin\nof equivalence (3). This is again caused by the\nQA-rush, and the rush is alleviated by increasing\nthe BWQA equivalence margin (8).\nIt can be seen that with different margins of\nequivalence, a selection policy with the same pri-\nority order of QoS attributes can deliver signifi-\ncantly improved delay\/bandwidth performance.\nThis can be seen by comparing PRI_BW-\n75_DEL-100 with PRI_BW-175_DEL-50. It\nappears, therefore, that it is better for the path-\nselection process not to be too narrow in its\nn Figure 2.

We have shown that selecting paths based\non bandwidth can deliver higher bandwidth but\nalso significantly higher delay than the best-\neffort (BE) Internet; and that selecting paths\nbased on delay provides only a small improve-\nment on the BE Internet, since the shortest AS\npath is effectively the one with the lowest delay.\nFurther, if QoS parameters are compared too\nstrictly, use of QoS information can in fact hin-\nder delivered QoS. However, significant QoS\nimprovements over the BE Internet are obtained\nif two QoS parameters (delay and bandwidth)\nare used to select paths, with better overall QoS\nobtained by prioritizing delay over bandwidth,\nrather than bandwidth over delay.\nQ-BGP AND QOS AT LARGER SCALES\nIn this second set of simulation runs we exam-\nined the behaviour of q-BGP in larger networks.\nDetailed modelling of internal AS topologies\nwas avoided by assuming that intra-AS traffic\ntreatment caused a constant average one-way\ndelay between all border routers. The average\ndelay was constant for a given AS but varied\nbetween ASs with a uniformly random distribu-\ntion (between 5 and 50 ms). In the set of simula-\ntion results presented below it was assumed that\nno additional delay due to congestion was intro-\nduced at either interdomain or intradomain\nlinks, which is equivalent to the case of overpro-\nvisioned networks \u2014 a simplification introduced\nto reduce computation requirements for large-\nscale simulation runs. Four different topologies\nwere generated for each topology size (defined\nby the number of ASs), with other topological\nparameters, such as degree of connectivity,\nremaining constant. For each instance of the\ntopology, twelve separate examples of intra-AS\none-way delay allocations were created. The\nresults for each topology size are therefore the\naverage over 48 simulation runs of different\ntopologies and intra-AS delay distributions.\nThe improvement in delay can be seen in Fig.\n3 as a function of AS topology size. It can be\nseen that the benefit of additional QoS informa-\ntion in q-BGP messages increases with topology\nsize. This is due to a greater number of alterna-\ntive AS paths between a given source-destination\npair in a larger topology. Therefore, the chances\nof finding an improved path based on one-way\ndelay are increased.\nThe use of additional QoS information in q-\nBGP brings an additional overhead in terms of\nan increased number of q-BGP UPDATE mes-\nsages. Figure 4 shows the total number of q-\nBGP messages sent from the first set of\nbootstrap messages through to a stable routing\nconfiguration. It should be noted that there is no\nmessage aggregation in these simulations, either\non network prefixes or QoS attributes. When the\ntwo plots are extrapolated to a topology size of\n18,000 ASs the q-BGP category two routing\nscheme produces approximately three times as\nmany messages as category one q-BGP. The\ninclusion of additional QoS information in q-\nBGP therefore scales, in terms of number of q-\nBGP messages, in a similar way to q-BGP\nUPDATES and route selection based on m-QC\nid only. By this we mean that the number of\nmessages forms a power law with topology size,\nwhich is equivalent to the scaling of BGP today.\nThe main reason for the increased number of\nmessages required for convergence is that the\npreferred AS path, on QoS grounds, may not\nalways be the shortest one. Imagine, from the\nperspective of the AS receiving q-BGP\nUPDATEs, that the shortest AS path to a par-\nticular destination prefix has three AS hops, but\nthe total one-way packet delay (in the data\nplane) as reported in q-BGP is significantly\ngreater than an alternative five-hop AS path.\nAccording to the q-BGP route selection priority\nrules, the longer path with a smaller delay should\nbe preferred.

In the\nabsence of the five-hop shorter-delay announce-\nment, q-BGP will select the first route and\nannounce this to its peers. On receipt of the sub-\nsequent announcement of the shorter-delay\npath, q-BGP will select the latter route and\npropagate it to its peers: thereby increasing the\ntotal number of q-BGP messages and introduc-\ning a transient routing instability. One way of\nmitigating this would be for ASs to wait for\nsome period to be sure they have received all\nlikely updates, rather than make immediate deci-\nsions. This would improve the transient stability\nof the solution, but at the cost of longer conver-\ngence times.\nCONCLUSIONS AND\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nThis article has proposed a simple scheme for\nproviding qualitative QoS guarantees across mul-\ntiple domains. The solution has two aspects.\nFirstly, offline TE processes drive the establish-\nment of QoS-based SLSs with neighbouring ASs\nfor exchanging traffic belonging to one of a lim-\nited set of well-known meta-QoS-classes. The\nestablishment of similar bilateral agreements\nbetween other ASs will result in the creation of\nmeta-QoS-class planes which extend across the\nInternet. Secondly, a QoS-enhanced BGP proto-\ncol and route selection process ensures that\ninterdomain routing topologies are dynamically\nconstructed for each plane. By itself this yields\nperformance improvements over the standard\nbest-effort Internet by virtue of packets receiving\nsimilar differentiated treatment within each AS\nalong the path to its destination.\nSimulation has suggested that performance\ncan be enhanced further by including addition-\nal QoS information into q-BGP messages and\nby utilising an enhanced route selection pro-\ncess to select routes based on this QoS infor-\nmation. The results show that delivered\nend-to-end delay or bandwidth is improved\nwhen q-BGP selection policies select paths\nbased on related QoS attributes. However, if\nthe equivalence margin of QoS attributes on\ncompeting paths is  set too narrow, then a\ndegradation of performance compared to that\noffered by classical BGP selection policies may\nbe observed due to the phenomenon of \u201cQA\nrush,\u201d where the common sections of the paths\nare overloaded. This can be mitigated by\nincreasing the margin of equivalence when\ncomparing QoS attributes, so that selection is\nalso performed on metrics of a lower priority,\nsuch as a second QoS attribute or AS path\nlength. Now, while sufficient quantities of bet-\nter paths are retained, there are more choices\nof paths resulting in sufficient routing diversity\nwhich alleviates congestion.\nIt has been demonstrated that different\nroute selection policies result in different deliv-\nered performance. It is important to state that\nthis is in addition to any service differentiation\nimplemented by utilising different PHBs\/pack-\net-forwarding priorities within the routers of\neach AS. On the other hand, this result indi-\ncates that end-to-end QoS differentiation is\nachievable even with homogenous forwarding\nbehaviour.\nWhile the performance benefits of QoS-based\npath selection have been demonstrated, it has\nalso been shown that the cost of the solution is\nnot prohibitive in terms of the number of addi-\ntional q-BGP UPDATE messages. Simulation\nresults of the DELAYQA-only q-BGP policy\nwith no equivalence margin (which is the worst-\ncase scenario in terms of number of messages)\nshow that the number of q-BGP messages\nrequired for stable interdomain routing scales\nwith AS-topology size in a similar way to classi-\ncal BGP. With larger equivalence margins, the\ntotal number of messages is reduced.\nOngoing work includes the investigation of\nsoft partitioning of m-QC planes and interdo-\nmain SLS capacities, studying the interaction of\nmultiple routing policies over several m-QC\nplanes, and the impact of injecting dynamically\nmeasured QoS metrics into q-BGP while avoid-\ning potential instabilities caused by route-flap-\nping.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was undertaken under the Informa-\ntion Society Technologies (IST) MESCAL and\nAGAVE projects, which are partially funded by\nthe Commission of the European Union.
