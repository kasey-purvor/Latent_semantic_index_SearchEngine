To investigate relationships between the actual minerals in the soils and \nthe aqua-regia extractable Se content of the soil, soil minerals were quantified by X-ray \ndiffraction.  \n                                                   \n*\n Correspondence to: Charles Shand, Soils Group, Macaulay Land Use Research \nInstitute, Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, AB15 8QH, UK.

No simple correlation between the aqua-regia extractable Se contents of \nthe soil and the parent rock classification estimated by soil survey was evident. Partial \nleast squares analysis revealed that the aqua-regia extractable Se content of the soils \nwas positively related to loss on ignition (LOI) and negatively related to the K\u2013\nfeldspar content with other mineral being less important.  \nCONCLUSION: The Se content of arable topsoils from Scotland is more related to \nLOI or carbon content with parent material being less important. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nFollowing the discovery of Se as a factor against liver necrosis in rats 1 and of the role \nof Se in glutathione peroxidase 2 the element is widely recognised as being essential \nfor human and animal health.3 Possible links between Se status and the occurrence of \nhealth disorders in humans have been reviewed.4-6 Intakes of Se by the UK population \nhave declined from a mean of 60 \u00b5g Se day -1 in 1974 to 30 - 40 \u00b5g Se day -1 in recent \ntimes, primarily due to the replacement of American milling wheat with quantities of \nUK sourced grain with lower Se content.7-11 Selenium intake by the population is also \nrelatively low in Scotland 12,13 and there is increasing interest in the provision of \ninformation leading to a better understanding of Se supply, especially in situations \nwhere people and animals rely heavily on locally produced foods as a source of \nessential elements. \n  Selenium is a chalcophile element and concentrations of Se in evolved magmatic \nrocks, such as granite, are relatively low. During the weathering of rock, Se is \naccumulated in fine sediments.14,15 Selenium can also become concentrated in organic \nPage 2 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nmatter and organic-rich sediments. Overall, the Se contents of soils formed from \nandesitic, basaltic or argillaceous materials are expected to be richer in Se than soils \nformed from granites, sandstones, rhyolites, mica schist or non-volcanic greywacke.16 \nThe influence of parent material on the Se content of soils has been demonstrated in \nEngland and Wales.17 Scottish soils are distinguished from those in England and \nelsewhere in that they have geologically diverse parent material and often contain large \namounts of organic C. Yet, relatively little is known 16,18-20 about the pattern of \ndistribution of Se in the Scottish landscape. \n Selenium can be measured by inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry \n(ICP-MS) with an Ar based plasma and the ICP-MS method has advantages over \nothers with regard to ease of use and multi-element capability. Selenium has six \nnaturally occurring isotopes; 74Se (0.87 %), 76Se (9.02 %), 77Se (7.58 %), 78Se (23.52 \n%), 80Se (49.82 %) and 82Se (9.19 %).21 The use of 76Se, 78Se and 80Se suffer \ninterferences from Ar dimmers e.g. 40Ar2+, whereas, the others may suffer from a range \nof mixed element ion interferences.22,23 Cool plasma conditions reduce Ar2-based \ninterference but are not suited for the analysis of Se, which has a large ionisation \npotential. Collision \/ reaction cell methodology using a mixture of H2 and He has been \ndeveloped to simultaneously remove 40Ar40Ar+ and 40Ar35Cl+ interferences in the \ndetermination of 80Se and 75As in chloride-rich matrices and mineral waters.24 Aqua \nregia digests of sediments have been analysed by ICP-MS using 82Se: interference \nfrom 82Kr+ (Ar contaminant), 34S16O3+ and 66Zn16O+ were found to be insignificant or \neliminated during blank subtraction. Bromine interference (81Br1H+) was eliminated \nthrough oxidation of Br- by NOCl, present in aqua regia, to volatile Br2.25 The use of \nH2 in the reaction cell has advantages over other gases in that H2 reacts little with Se \nand causes minimal scattering.

The \nuse of the less abundant 78Se with interference from 38Ar40Ar+ is preferred and is \nrecommended by the manufacturer of the instrument we used. The use ICP-MS with \nH2 in the reaction cell for the analysis of Se in nitric \/ perchloric acid digests of soil \nusing both 78Se and 80Se has been reported 11 but no details related to the choice of \nisotopes for analytical purposes were presented. \n Our aims were: (1) to demonstrate that the analysis of the Se in aqua regia digests of \nsoils could be satisfactorily achieved by ICP-MS using 78Se with H2 as the reaction cell \ngas under routine, multi-element conditions, and (2), to investigate relationships \nbetween soil Se content of arable soils and other soil components, especially soil \nminerals and C. \n \nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n \nSoils \nThe information concerning the relative Se contents of different rock types16 discussed \nin the introduction, was used to identify areas of soils (Fig. 1) with associations (i.e. \nparent material) expected to have relatively \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d Se status, the remainder \nbeing \u201cunclassified\u201d because there was insufficient information. To test the validity of \nthe hypothesis that soils formed from these different parent materials would indeed \nhave different Se contents, we selected 47 soils from an archive of 981 air-dried, 2-mm \nsieved topsoils, which had been taken across Scotland on a 10-km grid basis as part of \na national inventory.26 Our selection of samples was based firstly on a restriction to \nsoils which had been ploughed (224 samples), and secondly, to soils from associations \nPage 4 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nwith extensive coverage (Table 1) within which we selected examples of soils \nrepresenting the major soil groups (alluvial soils, brown earths, podzols and gleys). \nThe particle size distribution of the soil was determined by a hydrometer method after \ndispersion in 0.02 M sodium hydroxide. Loss on ignition (LOI) was determined by \nrecording the weight loss after heating the soil at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h. Soil pH was measured \nin 0.01 M CaCl2 using a 1:3 (mass to volume) soil to solution ratio. For the \ndetermination of Se and C contents, the soil was ground in an agate ball mill to a \nparticle size < 150 \u00b5m. The total C content of the soil was determined by combustion \nin a Hewlett-Packard CHN analyzer. \n \nMineralogical composition of soils \nTo provide information about the mineralogical composition of the soils they were \nquantitatively analysed by X-ray diffraction using an X\u2019Pert Pro diffractometer \n(PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) with an X\u2019Celerator position sensitive \ndetector. Randomly orientated samples of the soil for X-ray analysis were prepared by \nspray-drying.27 Analysis of the diffractgrams was performed by a full-pattern fitting \nreference intensity ratio method.28 \n \nAqua regia extraction of soils \nThe soil extraction with aqua regia was based on the British standard reflux method, \nISO 11466.29 Each determination used 2 g of the finely-ground soil and high purity \n\u201cAristar\u201d grade hydrochloric and nitric acids from VWR International Ltd, Poole, UK. \nA small amount of gold (III) chloride was added to each of the aqua regia digests to \npreserve them 30 for future Hg analysis (not reported here). \n \nPage 5 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nICP-MS analysis of soil extracts \nWe used an Agilent 7500ce instrument with an octopole reaction cell employing H2, \nmicro flow nebuliser and integrated autosampler to measure 78Se+. Instrument \nperformance was optimised using a solution containing 10 \u00b5g l-1 each of Li, Y, Tl and \nCe. Maximum sensitivity was achieved by monitoring 7Li, 89Y and 207Tl signals and \nminimum oxide formation by monitoring the 140Ce:16O140Ce ratio. For calibration we \nused a 1g Se l-1 solution diluted to provide a range of working standards containing up \nto 1 mg Se l-1 in a matrix of 2.5 M hydrochloric acid and 1.4 M nitric acid. To \nminimise damage to the Ni skimmer cones, sample extracts and standard solutions \nwere diluted by a factor of ten before entering the plasma. To correct for instrument \ninstabilities a solution of 500 \u00b5g Ge l-1 was aspirated and the signal from 72Ge \nmonitored.  \n \nQuality control \nTo provide a check on the quality of the ICP-MS data for Se we analysed the aqua \nregia extracts by an independent method.

Unless otherwise noted, error \nterms presented are standard deviations. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis provides a \nnon-mechanistic approach to investigate mathematical relationships between soil \nproperties. The technique has most often been applied to spectroscopic data but has \nbeen used for prediction of soil properties from non-spectroscopic data and is \nparticularly useful for analysis of data sets with collinear information and where there \nis a large number of variables.32 \n \nRESULTS \n \nSelenium content of inventory soils \nThe Scottish soils (n = 47) were found to have Se contents ranging from 0.19 to 1.46 \nmg kg-1 measured by ICP-MS (Table 2).

A comparison of \nthe ICP-MS results of analysis with those from fluorimetry is presented in Fig. 2. \nStatistical analysis of the data by the paired t-test led to the acceptance of the \nhypothesis that the mean difference between the results of the ICP-MS and those by \nfluorimetry was significantly different from zero (at p = 0.05) and that the ICP-MS \nmethod, overall, gave slightly greater values.

Similarly, there was no significant difference (p = 0.05) between Se \nconcentration in soil divided into major soil groups; the average concentration of Se in \nalluvial soils was 0.603 (n = 5), brown earths 0.619 (n = 21), gleys 0.551 (n = 9) and \npodzols 0.720 (n = 12) mg kg-1. A more general significant link between the Se content \nof the soils and their C content (R2 = 0.578) or LOI, (R2 = 0.700) was apparent from a \nplot of soil C content or LOI against Se concentration in the soil (Fig. 3), both \nrelationships being statistically significant (p = < 0.001). \n \nValidation of analytical methodology to determine Se \nThe aqua regia extractable Se contents of certified reference soils were found to be \n1.21 \u00b1 0.25 mg kg-1 for NCS DC 73387 (certified total 1.34 \u00b1 0.17 mg kg-1) and 0.16 \u00b1 \n0.08 mg kg-1 for NCS DC 73389 (certified total 0.10 \u00b1 0.01 mg kg-1). The value found \nfor the aqua regia extractable Se content of the proficiency testing \u201cContest\u201d soil was \n1.49 \u00b1 0.02 mg kg-1 (assigned value 1.49 mg Se kg-1). The Se content of the IAEA \ndried blood determined by fluorimetry gave a value of 0.22 \u00b1 0.009 mg kg-1 (certified \nvalue 0.24 \u00b1 0.009 mg kg-1). The Se content of the aqua regia digests of the certified \nsoils determined by fluorimetry were 1.34 \u00b1 0.12 mg kg-1 for NCS DC 73387 and 0.08 \n\u00b1 0.00 mg kg-1 for NCS DC 73389. The limit of detection for Se analysis by ICP-MS \nestimated as 3 \u00d7 standard deviation of ten intraset blank readings was 1.4 \u00b5g Se l-1, \nwhich is equivalent to the concentration of a digest derived from a soil containing 0.07 \nmg Se kg-1.  \n \n Mineralogical composition determined by XRD \nPage 8 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nThe minerals present in the soils included quartz with lesser amounts of K-feldspar, \nplagioclase and amphibole; for simplicity the minerals have been grouped together into \nclasses (Table 2). The amount of clay-sized material in the soils measured by classical \nsedimentation methods presented in Table 1 was generally less than the amount of \nphyllosilicates measured by X-ray diffraction. This difference has been observed in \nmany other samples analysed in the same way in our laboratory and is indicative of the \npresence of aggregates in the chemically dispersed samples. \n \nCorrelations between Se and other soil components \nPartial least squares analysis of the data with the Se content of the soils determined by \nICP-MS as the response variate and the mineralogical phases shown in Table 2 and the \npercentage LOI or C as the predictors indicated that the aqua regia extractable Se \ncontent of the soils was best explained (optimal with regard to cross validation) by a 3-\ncomponent model which had an R2 value of 0.79 and a predicted R2 value of 0.71 by \ncross validation. The PLS response plot indicat d that the model fitted the data well \nand that there was no extreme leverage. The PLS coefficient plot (Fig. 4a) showed that \nthe most important components were LOI (standardised regression coefficient 0.68) \nand K-feldspar (standardised regression coefficient - 0.26) with data for other mineral \nphases being less important and varying in sign. The loading plot (Fig. 4b) indicated \nthat the influences of LOI and K-feldspar on Se content of the soil were relatively \nimportant and opposite in direction within component 1 of the model, which contains \nterms related to all the predictors. \n We were unable measure S in the aqua regia digests because of isobaric \ninterferences but found significant (p < 0.05), linear correlations with other elements \nincluding As (r = 0.426), Cd (r = 0.623), Cr (r = 0.347), Cu (r = 0.348), Fe (r = 0.348), \nPage 9 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nP (r = 0.453) and Pb (r = 0.449).  \n The map (Fig. 5) shows the predicted distribution of aqua regia extractable Se in \narable soils based on the relationship, aqua regia extractable soil S concentration (mg \nkg-1) = 0.0381 \u00d7 percent LOI + 0.1655 (Fig. 3b).

Analysis of soil \nand stream sediments from England and Wales by the British Geological Survey have \nshown that the total Se ranged between 0.1 and 4 mg Se kg-1 and that > 95 % of them \ncontained < 1 mg Se kg-1.10 \n The data for the analysis of the standard reference or test materials agreed well with \nthe given values providing confidence in the accuracy of the data. The considerable \nvariation in Se concentration values measured by ICP-MS especially those for soils \ncontaining < 0.4 mg Se kg-1 is a reflection of closeness of values to the limit of the \nmethod.

The nitric and hydrochloric acids used to prepare \nthe aqua regia were of a high-purity, analytical grade but it is possible that further \npurification of the acids may result in a lower quantification limit for Se in soils. \n A study involving sequential extraction of Se from four Scottish soils using 0.25 M \npotassium chloride (soluble fraction), 0.1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate (ligand-\nexchangeable), 4 M hydrochloric acid (acid extractable), potassium chlorate\n \n\/ \nhydrochloric acid (oxidiseable fraction) and hydrofluoric acid (residual fraction) has \nshown that most of the Se (62 %) was associated with the residual hydrofluoric acid \nsoluble fraction.34 It can be assumed that aqua regia will extract Se associated with the \nsoluble, ligand exchangeable and oxidiseable fractions but the extent to which aqua \nregia extracts Se from the residual fraction is unknown.

Positive relationships between the \namounts of Se and soil organic matter have been reported.38,39 For the soils studied by \nus, the C content of the soil was a more important factor in determining the aqua regia \nextractable Se content of soil than the parent rock type as assessed by soil surveyors in \nthe field. There is also the possibility of inputs of Se from the atmosphere, fertilisers or \norganic matter, or by loss or gain of soil forming minerals by physical effect such as \noutwashing.40 A comparatively high concentration of Se in Norwegian coastal areas \nwas found to be associated with atmospheric inputs and a high content of soil organic \nmatter.41 Other studies have also shown that Se in soils is can be associated with \norganic matter although the mechanism of interaction and the chemical species present \nin the complex is unclear because of the presence of mixed organic matter and mineral \nphases. 42 \n The C content of soils from the National Inventory of Scotland (10-km grid) follows \na bimodal distribution reflecting the composition of mineral soils (mean 5.5 % C for \n219 samples) and organic soils (mean 43.6 % C for 414 samples).43 In the Scottish \ncontext, soils with a C content < 25% are considered to be mineral soils, whereas, soils \nwith a C content of > 25% are considered to be organic soils. The soils studied here in \nPage 12 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \nrelation to Se content fall into the mineral soil category and the Se content of organic \nsoils such as peat or of soils with peaty surface horizons is not part of the study.  \n The improved linear correlation between the Se content and LOI of the soils (R2 = \n0.847) compared to Se content and percentage C content of the soils (R2 = 0.578) may \nbe explained by the inclusion of the weight loss due to structural dehydroxylation in \nthe LOI measurement. For soil minerals, structural dehydroxylation on heating is \nlargely a phenomenon associated with phyllosilicates, which on heating first loose \ninterlayer water and then water from structural hydroxyl groups as the temperature is \nincreased. Clay minerals are important for the fixation of Se 44 and the improved \ncorrelation may in part also reflect this phenomenon. However, the value of correlation \ncoefficient between Se content and soil C or LOI (Fig 3) is dependent on the variation \nassociated with the measurement of C or LOI. The values for C and LOI taken from \nthe database of the Soil Survey of Scotland were single values and the associated error \nterms were not available.  \n The apparent link between Se and K-feldspar content of the soil is more difficult to \nexplain. Nonetheless, feldspars are a major component of granite and other evolved \nigneous rocks. The negative link between Se and feldspar content could reflect the fact \nthat rock with large K-feldspar contents are not of sedimentary origin and therefore \nless likely to contain S bearing minerals and associated Se components. Although we \ncould not measure S in the aqua regia digests we did observe significant (p < 0.05), \npositive correlations with other elements such as Cu that are associated with S.14  \n For arable topsoils in Scotland it is possible to construct crude maps of Se \ndistribution from soil carbon contents or LOI alone with mineralogical information \nadding improvements. At present this refinement is not possible because a complete set \nof quantitative mineralogical data for the arable soil of Scotland is not available. \nPage 13 of 27\nJSFA@wiley.com\nJournal of the Science of Food and Agriculture\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe thank Dr Renate Wendler for technical support, Donna Macdonald for carrying out \nthe ICP-MS analysis, Betty Duff for statistical advice and Mark Jones along with \nMalcolm Coull for producing the maps. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
