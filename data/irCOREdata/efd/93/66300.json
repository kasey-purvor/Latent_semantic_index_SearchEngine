We explore a model which assumes a top-heavy IMF in starbursts, and which has\npreviously been shown to explain the sub-mm number counts and the luminosity function of\nLyman-break galaxies at high redshift. We show that this model, with the simple assump-\ntion that a fixed fraction of Ly\u03b1 photons escape from each galaxy, is remarkably success-\nful at explaining the observed luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters over the redshift range\n3 < z < 6.6. We also examine the distribution of Ly\u03b1 equivalent widths and the broad-band\ncontinuum magnitudes of emitters, which are in good agreement with the available observa-\ntions. We look more deeply into the nature of Ly\u03b1 emitters, presenting predictions for fun-\ndamental properties such as the stellar mass and radius of the emitting galaxy and the mass\nof the host dark matter halo. The model predicts that the clustering of Ly\u03b1 emitters at high\nredshifts should be strongly biased relative to the dark matter, in agreement with observational\nestimates. We also present predictions for the luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters at z > 7, a\nredshift range which is starting to be be probed by near-IR surveys and using new instruments\nsuch as DAzLE.\nKey words: galaxies:evolution \u2013 galaxies:formation \u2013 galaxies:high-redshift \u2013 galax-\nies:luminosity function \u2013 cosmology:theory\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAfter an unpromising start, searches for Ly\u03b1 emission are\nnow proving to be a powerful means of detecting star-forming\ngalaxies at high redshift (e.g. Hu, Cowie & McMahon 1998;\nPascarelle, Windhorst & Keel 1998; Kudritzki et al. 2000), com-\npeting in observing efficiency with techniques such as broad-band\nsearches for Lyman-break galaxies. The next generation of near-\ninfrared instrumentation (e.g. Horton et al. 2004) will in principle\nallow Ly\u03b1 emitting galaxies to be found up to z \u223c 20, permitting a\nprobe of the star formation history of the Universe before the epoch\nwhen reionization is thought to have taken place.\nThere are in fact a number of different mechanisms which can\nproduce Ly\u03b1 emission from high redshift objects. (1) Gas in galax-\nies which is photo-ionized by young stars will emit Ly\u03b1 as hy-\ndrogen atoms recombine; this was originally proposed as a signa-\nture of primeval galaxies by Partridge & Peebles (1967). (2) Gas\ncan alternatively be ionized by radiation from an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). (3) Intergalactic gas clouds are predicted to emit\nLy\u03b1 recombination radiation due to ionization of the gas by the in-\ntergalactic ultraviolet background (e.g. Hogan & Weymann 1987;\nCantalupo et al. 2005). (4) Gas within a dark matter halo which\n\u22c6 E-mail: delliou@alfmail.cii.fc.ul.pt (MLeD)\nis cooling and collapsing to form a galaxy may radiate much of\nthe gravitational collapse energy by collisionally-excited Ly\u03b1 emis-\nsion (e.g. Haiman, Spaans & Quataert 2000; Fardal et al. 2001).\n(5) Finally, Ly\u03b1 can also be emitted from gas which has been\nshock heated by galactic winds or by jets in radio galaxies (e.g.\nMcCarthy et al. 1987). The majority of high-redshift Ly\u03b1 emitters\n(LAEs) detected so far are compact, and appear to be individual\ngalaxies in which the Ly\u03b1 emission is powered by photoionization\nof gas by young stars. Ly\u03b1 surveys have also found another class\nof emitter, the so-called Ly\u03b1 blobs, in which the Ly\u03b1 emission is\nmuch more extended than individual galaxies, and may be powered\npartly by AGNs or gas cooling (Steidel et al. 2000; Bower et al.\n2004; Matsuda et al. 2004). We will be focusing in this paper on\nLy\u03b1 emission powered by young stars, and so will not consider the\nLy\u03b1 blobs further.\nTo date, there has been relatively little theoretical work on try-\ning to predict the properties of star-forming Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies\nwithin a realistic galaxy formation framework. Haiman & Spaans\n(1999) made predictions for the number of emitters based on the\nhalo mass function and using ad-hoc assumptions linking Ly\u03b1\nemission to halo mass, while Barton et al. (2004) made predic-\ntions for very high redshifts (z > 7) based on a gas-dynamical\nsimulation. Furlanetto et al. (2005) used gas-dynamical simula-\ntions to calculate Ly\u03b1 emission both from star-forming objects and\n2 Le Delliou et al.\nfrom the intergalactic medium in the redshift range 0 < z < 5.\nHowever, the first calculation of the abundance of Ly\u03b1 emitters\nbased on a detailed hierarchical galaxy formation model was that of\nLe Delliou et al. (2005, hereafter Paper I). In Paper I, we used the\nGALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model to predict the\nabundance of star-forming Ly\u03b1 emitters as a function of redshift\nin the cold dark matter (CDM) model. The GALFORM model com-\nputes the assembly of dark matter halos by mergers, and the growth\nof galaxies both by cooling of gas in halos and by galaxy mergers.\nIt calculates the star formation history of each galaxy, including\nboth quiescent star formation in galaxy disks and also bursts trig-\ngered by galaxy mergers, as well as the feedback effects of galactic\nwinds driven by supernova explosions. In Paper I, we found that a\nvery simple model, in which a fixed fraction of Ly\u03b1 photons escape\nfrom each galaxy, regardless of its other properties, gave a surpris-\ningly good match to the total numbers of Ly\u03b1 emitters detected in\ndifferent surveys over a range of redshifts. We also explored the\nimpact of varying certain parameters in the model, such as the red-\nshift of reionization of the intergalactic medium, on the abundance\nof emitters.\nIn this paper, we explore in more detail the fiducial model\nof Paper I (based on an \u2126m = 0.3, spatially flat, \u039bCDM model\nwith a reionization redshift of 10). We use the full capability of\nthe GALFORM model to predict a wide range of galaxy properties,\nconnecting various observables to Ly\u03b1 emission. The galaxy for-\nmation model we use is the same as that proposed by Baugh et al.\n(2005). A critical assumption of this model is that stars formed in\nstarbursts have a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), while stars\nformed quiescently in galactic disks have a solar neighbourhood\nIMF. We showed in Baugh et al. that, within the framework of\n\u039bCDM, the top-heavy IMF is essential for matching the counts and\nredshifts of sub-millimetre galaxies and the luminosity function of\nLyman break galaxies at z = 3 (once dust extinction is included),\nwhile remaining consistent with galaxy properties in the local uni-\nverse such as the optical and far-IR luminosity functions and galaxy\ngas fractions and metallicities. More detailed comparisons of this\nmodel with observations of Lyman-break galaxies and of galaxy\nevolution in the IR will be presented in Lacey et al. (2005a, 2005b,\nin preparation). The assumption of a top-heavy IMF is controver-\nsial, but underpins the success of the model in explaining the high-\nredshift sub-mm and Lyman-break galaxies. It is therefore impor-\ntant to test this model against as many observables as possible.\nNagashima et al. (2005a) showed that a top-heavy IMF seems to\nbe required to explain the metal content of the hot intracluster gas in\ngalaxy clusters, and Nagashima et al. (2005b) showed that a sim-\nilar top-heavy IMF also seems to be necessary to explain the ob-\nserved abundances of \u03b1-elements (such as Mg) in the stellar pop-\nulations of elliptical galaxies. In the present paper, we explore the\npredictions of the Baugh et al. (2005) model for the properties of\nLy\u03b1-emitting galaxies and compare them with observational data.\nWe emphasize that our aim here is to explore in detail a particular\ngalaxy formation model which has been shown to satisfy a wide\nrange of other observational constraints, rather than to conduct a\nsurvey of Ly\u03b1 predictions for different model parameters.\nIn Section 2, we give an outline of the GALFORM model, fo-\ncusing on how the predictions we present later on are calculated.\nSection 3 examines the evolution of the Ly\u03b1 luminosity function,\nand compares the model predictions with observational data over\nthe redshift range 3 . z . 7. In Section 4, we compare a selection\nof observed properties of Ly\u03b1 emitters with the model predictions.\nIn Section 5, we look at some other predictions of the model, most\nof which cannot currently be compared directly with observations.\nSection 6 extends the predictions for the Ly\u03b1 luminosity function\nto z > 7. We present our conclusions in Section 7 .\n2 GALAXY FORMATION MODEL\nWe use the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, GALFORM,\nto predict the Ly\u03b1 emission and many other properties of galaxies\nas a function of redshift. The general methodology and approxima-\ntions behind the GALFORMmodel are set out in detail in Cole et al.\n(2000). The particular model that we use in this paper is the same as\nthat described by Baugh et al. (2005). The background cosmology\nis a cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant (\u2126m =\n0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7, \u2126b = 0.04, h \u2261 H0\/100km s\n\u22121Mpc\u22121 = 0.7,\n\u03c38 = 0.93). Below we review the physics behind the particular\nmodel predictions that we highlight in this paper.\nThe GALFORMmodel follows the main processes which shape\nthe formation and evolution of galaxies. These include: (i) the\ncollapse and merging of dark matter halos; (ii) the shock-heating\nand radiative cooling of gas inside dark halos, leading to forma-\ntion of galaxy disks; (iii) quiescent star formation in galaxy disks;\n(iv) feedback both from supernova explosions and from photo-\nionization of the IGM; (v) chemical enrichment of the stars and\ngas; (vi) galaxy mergers driven by dynamical friction within com-\nmon dark matter halos, leading to formation of stellar spheroids,\nand also triggering bursts of star formation. The end product of the\ncalculations is a prediction of the number of galaxies that reside\nwithin dark matter haloes of different masses. The model predicts\nthe stellar and cold gas masses of the galaxies, along with their star\nformation and merger histories, and their sizes and metallicities.\nThe prescriptions and parameters for the different processes\nwhich we use in this paper are identical to Baugh et al. (2005).\nFeedback is treated in a similar way to Benson et al. (2003): en-\nergy injection by supernovae reheats some of the gas in galaxies\nand returns it to the halo, but also ejects some gas from halos as\na \u201csuperwind\u201d - the latter is essential for reproducing the observed\ncutoff at the bright end of the present-day galaxy luminosity func-\ntion. We also include feedback from photo-ionization of the IGM:\nfollowing reionization (i.e. for z < zreion), we assume that gas\ncooling in halos with circular velocities Vc < 60 kms\u22121 is com-\npletely suppressed. We assume in this paper that reionization occurs\nat zreion = 10, chosen to be intermediate between the low value\nz \u223c 6 suggested by measurements of the Gunn-Peterson trough in\nquasars (Becker et al. 2001) and the high value z \u223c 20 suggested\nby the WMAP measurement of polarization of the microwave back-\nground (Kogut et al. 2003). Our model has two different IMFs:\nquiescent star formation in galactic disks is assumed to produce\nstars with a solar neighbourhood IMF (we use the Kennicutt (1983)\nparamerization, with slope x = 0.4 below 1M\u2299 and x = 1.5\nabove), whereas bursts of star formation triggered by galaxy merg-\ners are assumed to form stars with a top-heavy, flat IMF with slope\nx = 0 (where the Salpeter slope is x = 1.35). In either case, the\nIMF covers the mass range 0.15 < m < 120M\u2299. As mentioned\nin the Introduction, the choice of a flat IMF in bursts is essential\nfor the model to reproduce the observed counts of galaxies at sub-\nmm wavelengths. The parameters for star formation in disks and\nfor triggering bursts and morphological transformations in galaxy\nmergers are given in Baugh et al. (2005).\nThe sizes of galaxies are computed as in Cole et al. (2000):\ngas which cools in a halo is assumed to conserve its angular mo-\nmentum as it collapses, forming a rotationally-supported galaxy\ndisk; the radius of this disk is then calculated from its angular mo-\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 3\nmentum, including the gravity of the disk, spheroid (if any) and\ndark halo. Galaxy spheroids are built up both from pre-existing\nstars in galaxy mergers, and from the stars formed in bursts trig-\ngered by these mergers; the radii of spheroids formed in mergers\nare computed using an energy conservation argument. In calculat-\ning the sizes of disks and spheroids, we include the adiabatic con-\ntraction of the dark halo due to the gravity of the baryonic compo-\nnents.\nGiven the star formation and metal enrichment history of a\ngalaxy, GALFORM computes the spectrum of the integrated stel-\nlar population using a population synthesis model based on the\nPadova stellar evolution tracks (see Granato et al. 2000, for de-\ntails). Broad-band magnitudes are then computed by redshifting\nthe galaxy spectrum and convolving it with the filter response func-\ntions. We include extinction of the stellar continuum by dust in the\ngalaxy; this is computed based on a two-phase model of the dust\ndistribution, in which stars are born inside giant molecular clouds\nand then leak out into a diffuse dust medium (see Granato et al.\n2000, for more details). The optical depth for dust extinction of\nthe diffuse component is calculated from the mass and metallicity\nof the cold gas and the sizes of the disk and bulge. We note that\nthe extinction predicted by our model in which the stars and dust\nare mixed together is very different from what one obtains if all\nof the dust is in a foreground screen (as is commonly assumed in\nother theoretical models). Finally, we also include the effects on\nthe observed stellar continuum of absorption and scattering of ra-\ndiation by intervening neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to\nthe galaxy; we calculate this IGM attenuation using the formula of\nMadau (1995), which is based on the observed statistics of neutral\nhydrogen absorbers seen in quasar spectra.\nWe compute the Ly\u03b1 luminosities of galaxies by the following\nprocedure: (i) The model calculates the integrated stellar spectrum\nof the galaxy as described above, based on its star formation his-\ntory, and including the effects of the distribution of stellar metal-\nlicities and of variations in the IMF. (ii) We compute the rate of\nproduction of Lyman continuum (Lyc) photons by integrating over\nthe stellar spectrum, and assume that all of these ionizing photons\nare absorbed by neutral hydrogen within the galaxy. We assume\nphotoionization equilibrium applies within each galaxy, producing\nLy\u03b1 photons according to case B recombination (e.g. Osterbrock\n1989). We note that for solar metallicity, 11 times as many Lyc and\nLy\u03b1 photons are produced per unit mass of stars formed for our top-\nheavy (burst) IMF as compared to our solar neighbourhood (disk)\nIMF. (iii) The observed Ly\u03b1 flux or luminosity of a galaxy depends\non the fraction fesc of Ly\u03b1 photons which escape from the galaxy.\nLy\u03b1 photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen, and ab-\nsorbed by dust. Early estimates of this process (e.g. Charlot & Fall\n1991) showed that only a tiny fraction of Ly\u03b1 photons should es-\ncape from a static neutral galaxy ISM if even a tiny amount of\ndust is present. Many star-forming galaxies are nonetheless ob-\nserved to have significant Ly\u03b1 luminosities (e.g. Kunth et al. 1998;\nPettini et al. 2001), and this is generally ascribed to the presence\nof galactic winds in these systems, which allow Ly\u03b1 photons to es-\ncape after many fewer resonant scatterings. Radiative transfer cal-\nculations of Ly\u03b1 through winds have shown that this process can\nexplain the asymmetric Ly\u03b1 line profiles which are typically ob-\nserved (e.g. Ahn 2004). The effects of radiative transfer of Ly\u03b1\nthrough clumpy dust and gas have been considered by Neufeld\n(1991) and Hansen & Oh (2005).\nCalculating Ly\u03b1 escape fractions from first principles is\nclearly very complicated, and so we instead adopt a simpler ap-\nproach. In Paper I, we found that assuming a fixed escape frac-\nFigure 1.

The model predictions are shown for\nselected redshifts in the interval z = 0 to z = 7.\ntion fesc for each galaxy, regardless of its dust properties, resulted\nin a surprisingly good agreement between the predicted number\ncounts of emitters and the available observations. In that paper, we\nchose fesc = 0.02 to match the number counts at z \u2248 3 at a flux\nf \u2248 2\u00d710\u221217erg s\u22121, and we use the same value of fesc in this pa-\nper. Although this extreme simplification of a constant escape frac-\ntion may seem implausible, it does give a reasonably good match\nto the observed Ly\u03b1 luminosity functions and equivalent widths at\ndifferent redshifts, as we show in the next sections.\nOur calculations do not include any attenuation of the Ly\u03b1\nflux from a galaxy by propagation through the IGM. Ly\u03b1 pho-\ntons can be scattered out of the line-of-sight by any neutral hy-\ndrogen in the IGM close to the galaxy. If the emitting galaxy is\nat a redshift before reionization, when the IGM was still mostly\nneutral, this could in principle strongly suppress the observed Ly\u03b1\nflux (Miralda-Escude 1998). However, various effects can greatly\nreduce the amount of attenuation: ionization of the IGM around\nthe galaxy (Madau & Rees 2000; Haiman 2002), clearing of the\nIGM by galactic winds, gravitational infall of the IGM towards the\ngalaxy, and redshifting of the Ly\u03b1 emission by scattering in a wind\n(Santos 2004). In any case, since measurements of Gunn-Peterson\nabsorption in quasars show that reionization must have occured at\nz & 6.5, attenuation of Ly\u03b1 fluxes by the IGM should not affect\nour predictions for z . 6.5, but only our predictions for very high\nredshifts given in Section 6.\n3 EVOLUTION OF THE LY\u03b1 LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\nA basic prediction of our model is the evolution of the luminosity\nfunction of Ly\u03b1 emitters with redshift. This depends on the distri-\nbution of star formation rates in quiescent and starburst galaxies\n(with solar neighbourhood and top-heavy IMFs respectively), and\non the metallicity with which the stars are formed. Paper I showed\n4 Le Delliou et al.\nFigure 2. The evolution of the cumulative Ly\u03b1 luminosity function with redshift, comparing models with observational data. Each panel corresponds to a\ndifferent redshift, as indicated by the legend. The curves show model predictions, while the lines with symbols and symbols with error bars show observational\ndata. The solid curves show the predictions for the total luminosity function for our standard model, with a top-heavy IMF in bursts and fesc = 0.02, while\nthe dotted and short-dashed lines show the separate contributions of starbursts and quiescently star-forming galaxies respectively (in most cases the solid and\ndotted lines overlap). The long-dashed curves show the predicted total luminosity function for a variant model with a universal Kennicutt IMF and fesc = 0.2.\nThe references for the observational data (as shown in the symbol key) are as follows: Kudritzki - Kudritzki et al. (2000); Cowie & Hu - Cowie & Hu\n(1998); CADIS - Maier et al. (2003); Ouchi - Ouchi et al (2003); Santos - Santos et al. (2004); Ajiki - Ajiki et al. (2003); Hu - Hu et al. (2004); LALA -\nRhoads et al. (2003); Taniguchi - Taniguchi et al. (2005). The redshifts for the observational data are close to that of the model plotted in each panel, but do\nnot exactly coincide in all cases. In most cases, the data are plotted as stepped histograms, with each step corresponding to a single galaxy.\npredictions for the cumulative number counts of emitters per unit\nredshift as a function of observed Ly\u03b1 flux. Here we focus on a\nclosely related quantity, the cumulative space density of emitters as\na function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity at different redshifts. Fig.1 shows the\ncumulative luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters predicted by our\nstandard model for a set of redshifts over the interval z = 0\u22127. The\nmodel luminosity function initially gets brighter with increasing\nredshift, peaking at z = 3, before declining again in number den-\nsity at even higher redshifts. The increase in the luminosity function\nfrom z = 0 to z \u223c 3 is driven both by the increase in galaxy star\nformation rates, and by the increasing fraction of star formation oc-\ncuring in bursts (which have a top-heavy IMF). As shown in Fig.1\nin Baugh et al. (2005), the model predicts that the fraction of all\nstar formation occuring in bursts increases from \u223c 5% at z = 0 to\n50% at z \u223c 3.5 and then to \u223c 80% at z & 6.\nWe compare the model predictions with observational esti-\nmates of the cumulative Ly\u03b1 luminosity function in Fig.2, where\nwe show different redshifts in different panels. The observational\nestimates of the luminosity functions which we plot have been\ncalculated by Tran et al. (2004) (and also S. Lilly, private com-\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 5\nmunication, for z = 6.55) from published data on surveys for\nLAEs, assuming the same cosmology as we assume in our mod-\nels. The observed luminosity functions in the figures are labelled\naccording to the survey from which they were obtained. In each\ncase, surveys using narrow-band filters were used to find can-\ndidates for LAEs at particular redshifts, and then either broad-\nband colours or follow-up spectroscopy were used to determine\nwhich of the candidates were likely to be real Ly\u03b1 emitters,\nand which were likely to be lower-redshift interlopers resulting\nfrom other emission lines falling within the narrow-band filter re-\nsponse. The surveys with spectroscopic follow-up which we plot\nare Kudritzki et al. (2000), Cowie & Hu (1998), Hu et al. (2004),\nRhoads et al. (2003, LALA) and Taniguchi et al. (2005), while\nthe surveys using only colour selection are Maier et al. (2003,\nCADIS), Ouchi et al (2003) and Ajiki et al. (2003). We also show\nthe data of Santos et al. (2004) at z \u2248 5 from a spectroscopic\nsurvey of gravitationally-lensed fields. The stepped appearance of\nmost of the observed luminosity functions results from the small\nnumber of objects in most of the samples; each step corresponds to\nthe inclusion of an additional object as the luminosity is reduced.\nThe cumulative luminosity functions cut off at the bright end where\nthe observational samples contain only one object of that luminos-\nity; the statistical uncertainties are correspondingly largest at the\nhighest luminosities. For reference, we note that the luminosity dis-\ntance for our assumed cosmology is dL = (2.0, 3.2, 3.8, 4.5) \u00d7\n104h\u22121Mpc for z = 3.3, 4.9, 5.7, 6.55 respectively, so that a\nLy\u03b1 flux of 10\u221217erg cm\u22122s\u22121 at each of these redshifts cor-\nresponds to a luminosity (0.5, 1.2, 1.7, 2.4) \u00d7 1042h\u22122erg s\u22121\nrespectively. The lower luminosity limits on the observed lumi-\nnosity functions correspond to roughly the same Ly\u03b1 flux limit\n\u223c 10\u221217erg cm\u22122s\u22121 at each redshift.\nIn Fig.2, the predictions for our standard model (with a top-\nheavy IMF in bursts and fesc = 0.02) are shown by solid lines. We\nalso show the separate contributions of bursting and quiescently\nstar-forming galaxies respectively as dotted and short-dashed lines.\nIn most cases, the dotted line is barely distinguishable from the\nsolid line, showing that the model Ly\u03b1 luminosity function is com-\npletely dominated by bursts over the range of redshift and luminos-\nity plotted in Fig.2. Overall, there is broad agreement between the\npredicted and observed luminosity functions over the redshift range\nz = 3\u2212 6.6. This is remarkable, since we allowed ourselves to ad-\njust only one model parameter to fit the observational data, namely\nthe Ly\u03b1 escape fraction fesc. The model luminosity functions do\nnot perfectly match all of the observational data, but where there\nare differences between the model and observational data, there\nare also equally large differences between different observational\ndatasets. The differences between different observational datasets\ncould be due to a combination of (a) statistical fluctuations (most\nof the samples are small), (b) field-to-field variance due to galaxy\nclustering (e.g. Ouchi et al 2003; Shimasaku et al. 2003), (c) dif-\nferences in the details of how the samples are selected (e.g. differ-\nences in the equivalent width limit or photometric criteria applied),\nand (d) differing levels of contamination by objects which are not\nLy\u03b1 emitters. We note that the model predictions shown in Fig.2\ndo not include any limit on the equivalent width (EW) of the Ly\u03b1\nemission line, while the observational data shown all incorporate\ndifferent lower limits on the EW of line emission as well as on the\nline flux. However, as we show in \u00a74.1, these EW thresholds are\npredicted not to significantly affect the comparison of model and\nobserved luminosity functions in Fig.2.\nThe value of the Ly\u03b1 escape fraction which we find fits the\ndata, fesc = 0.02, is quite small. This is mainly because, over the\nrange of redshift and luminosity probed by the observations, the\ncounts of objects in our standard model are dominated by bursts,\nand we have assumed a top-heavy IMF in bursts. As noted above,\nthe Ly\u03b1 luminosity for a given star formation rate is about 10\ntimes larger with the top-heavy IMF than with a solar neighbour-\nhood IMF. We also show in Fig.2 by long-dashed lines the predic-\ntions of a variant model, in which we assume the same Kennicutt\nIMF for bursts and quiescent star formation, and with fesc = 0.2.\nEven though we have chosen fesc for this variant model to pro-\nvide the best overall match to the observational data in Fig.2, we\nsee that it agrees somewhat less well with the data than does our\nstandard model, especially at z = 3.3, where it predicts more\nlow-luminosity galaxies. Moreover, this variant model dramatically\nunder-predicts both the counts of sub-mm galaxies and the number\nof Lyman-break galaxies (see Fig.5(a) in Baugh et al. (2005)).\nWe have also investigated the effect on the predicted lumi-\nnosity functions of changing the IGM reionization redshift from\nour standard value zreion = 10. As described in \u00a72, this affects\ngalaxies in our model through photo-ionization feedback. For our\nstandard model, we find that varying zreion over the range 6.5 to\n20 changes the luminosity function by less than the scatter between\ndifferent observational datasets in Fig.2, over the range of luminos-\nity and redshift probed by those data. Choosing a different value of\nzreion in this range would therefore not significantly affect any of\nthe conclusions we draw here.\nFurlanetto et al. (2005) have computed luminosity functions\nof Ly\u03b1 emitters from a numerical simulation, including emission\nfrom gas heated by shocks and by the intergalactic ionizing back-\nground as well as emission from star-forming regions in galaxies.\nThey assume that stars all form with a Salpeter IMF. However,\nthe luminosity functions which they compute combine all of the\nemission from each dark matter halo, and so are different from\nthe luminosity functions of individual galaxies which our model\npredicts. Furthermore, they effectively assume an escape fraction\nfesc = 1 for Ly\u03b1 emission from star formation. They do not make\nany detailed comparison with observational data on Ly\u03b1-emitting\ngalaxies, but note that their luminosity functions predict roughly an\norder-of-magnitude more objects than are observed over the range\nLLy\u03b1 \u223c 10\n42 \u2212 1043erg s\u22121. This is roughly consistent with what\nwe would find if we assumed a Kennicutt IMF for all star formation\nand fesc = 1.\n4 OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES OF LY\u03b1 EMITTERS\nNow that we have established that our model gives a very good\nmatch to the luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters at different red-\nshifts, we turn our attention to other observable properties of these\nobjects. We first present predictions for the distribution of Ly\u03b1\nequivalent widths (\u00a74.1), before examining the broad-band contin-\nuum magnitudes of Ly\u03b1 emitters (\u00a74.2) and, finally, the size distri-\nbution of emitters (\u00a74.3).\n4.1 Ly\u03b1 equivalent widths\nOur model allows a simple prediction for the equivalent width\n(EW) of the Ly\u03b1 emission line in each galaxy: we divide the lumi-\nnosity in the emission line by the mean luminosity per unit wave-\nlength of the stellar continuum on either side of the line. We distin-\nguish between the net and intrinsic line and stellar luminosities and\nequivalent widths. The net values are obtained after we multiply the\nLy\u03b1 luminosity by the escape fraction fesc and after we attenuate\n6 Le Delliou et al.\nthe stellar luminosity by dust extinction, while the intrinsic values\nare those before we include either the Ly\u03b1 escape fraction or dust\nattenuation. A limitation of our current model is that it does not\ninclude the effects of absorption of Ly\u03b1, so the equivalent widths\nwe calculate are always positive (or zero). Ly\u03b1 absorption features\n(corresponding to negative equivalent widths) could be produced\neither by absorption in stellar atmospheres (Charlot & Fall 1993),\nor by neutral gas within the galaxy or in an expanding shell or wind\naround it (Tenorio-Tagle et al. 1999). Our calculations are there-\nfore incomplete, but nevertheless represent an important first step.\nFig.3 shows the model predictions for rest-frame equivalent\nwidths of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies at z=3. The most remarkable fea-\nture of these plots is the wide spread of EWs predicted by the\nmodel. This is seen most clearly in the middle panel, which shows\nthe distribution of equivalent widths for galaxies selected to have\nLy\u03b1 fluxes in the range 10\u221217 < f < 10\u221216erg cm\u22122s\u22121. We see\nthat there is a big difference between the distributions of intrinsic\nand net EWs (shown by dashed and solid lines respectively). For\nthis flux range, the intrinsic rest-frame EW has a median value of\n130A\u02da, and most galaxies have EWs in the range 100\u2013200A\u02da. These\nvalues are similar to the predictions of Charlot & Fall (1993). The\nspread in intrinsic EWs results mostly from the spread in burst ages\nand timescales. For the same galaxies, the net EWs have a much\nlower median value, 33A\u02da, but with a much broader distribution,\nwith a peak close to 0 and a tail extending up to \u223c 400A\u02da. Since\nour model assumes that all galaxies have the same escape fraction\nfor Ly\u03b1, this broad distribution of net EWs results from the wide\nspread in values of dust extinction for the stellar continuum. The\nLy\u03b1 escape fraction reduces the net EW relative to the intrinsic\nvalue, but dust extinction of the stellar continuum increases it.\nThe upper panel of Fig.3 shows the median and 10-90 per-\ncentile range for the EW of Ly\u03b1 as a function of the net Ly\u03b1 flux.\nThere is a weak trend of EW increasing with Ly\u03b1 flux (or luminos-\nity). In the case of the intrinsic EW, this increase is driven mostly by\nthe shift from being dominated by quiescently star-forming galax-\nies (with a normal IMF) at low luminosities to being dominated\nby bursts (with a top-heavy IMF) at high luminosities, and by the\nchange in the typical star formation history. For the net EW, the\nincrease in the median is driven also by the increase in the typical\ndust extinction of the stellar continuum with increasing luminosity.\nThe Ly\u03b1 equivalent widths predicted by our model are sim-\nilar to those found in observed galaxy samples selected by their\nLy\u03b1 emission. Cowie & Hu (1998) and Kudritzki et al. (2000) se-\nlected LAEs having Ly\u03b1 fluxes \u223c 10\u221217 \u2212 10\u221216erg cm\u22122s\u22121\nat z = 3.4 and z = 3.1 respectively. In both cases, their narrow-\nband selection imposed a lower limit on the rest-frame EW \u2248 20A\u02da\nfor the detected objects, and the median rest-frame EW of the ob-\njects above this threshold was found to be \u2248 40A\u02da. This appears\nbroadly compatable with the predictions shown in Fig.3, once one\nallows for the fact that the EW threshold in the observed samples\nwill raise the median EW above the value expected in the absence\nof any EW threshold. At a higher redshift, z \u2248 4.5, Dawson et al.\n(2004) selected LAEs with f \u223c 10\u221217 \u2212 10\u221216erg cm\u22122s\u22121 and\nEW (rest) > 15A\u02da, and measured a median EW (rest) \u2248 80A\u02da for\ntheir sample. This is also in good agreement with our model, which\npredicts a median EW (rest) \u2248 80A\u02da for LAEs with 10\u221217 < f <\n10\u221216erg cm\u22122s\u22121 at this redshift.\nShapley et al. (2003) have measured Ly\u03b1 emission and ab-\nsorption profiles and EWs in a sample of galaxies at z \u223c 3 se-\nlected using the Lyman-break technique. Their sample is thus se-\nlected on rest-frame far-UV stellar continuum luminosity, rather\nthan on the presence of a strong Ly\u03b1 emission line. They find that\nFigure 3. The predicted rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the Ly\u03b1\nemission line for galaxies at z = 3. We show results both for the intrin-\nsic EW, i.e. before including attenuation by neutral gas and dust in the\ngalaxy, and for the net EW, i.e. after including the escape fraction for Ly\u03b1\nphotons and dust extinction of the stellar continuum - these are shown by\ndashed and solid lines respectively. In either case, the EW is considered\nas a function of the net Ly\u03b1 flux. (a) The upper panel shows the predicted\nmedian EW as a function of the net Ly\u03b1 flux. The error bars show the\n10-90 percentile range at a given flux. (b) The middle panel shows the pre-\ndicted distribution of EWs for galaxies with net Ly\u03b1 fluxes in the range\n10\u221217 \u2212 10\u221216erg cm\u22122s\u22121. (c) The lower panel shows the predicted\nEW distribution for galaxies selected to have continuum magnitudes in the\nrange 23 < RAB < 25.5.\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 7\nFigure 4. The effect of different equivalent width thresholds on the pre-\ndicted luminosity function of Ly\u03b1 emitters. In each panel, the lines show\nthe predicted cumulative luminosity function for different lower limits on\nthe rest-frame EW of Ly\u03b1 emission: EW> 0A\u02da (solid curves), EW> 20A\u02da\n(dotted), EW> 40A\u02da (short-dashed), and EW> 100A\u02da (long-dashed). (a)\nz = 3. (b) z = 6.\n\u223c 30% of their galaxies show Ly\u03b1 only in emission, \u223c 30% of\ngalaxies show Ly\u03b1 only in absorption, and \u223c 40% show a com-\nbination of Ly\u03b1 absorption and emission. They find a very asym-\nmetric and skewed distribution of Ly\u03b1 rest-frame EW\u2019s, with a me-\ndian close to 0A\u02da, extending down to \u223c \u221250A\u02da for net absorption\nand to & 100A\u02da for net emission. For the galaxies with net Ly\u03b1\nemission, the median EW is \u223c 20A\u02da. (For galaxies with net absorp-\ntion, the median EW is \u223c \u221220A\u02da.) The lower panel of Fig.3 shows\nthe EW distribution predicted by the model if we select galaxies\nin a similar way to Shapley et al. , with a continuum magnitude\nrange 23 < RAB < 25.5 (including dust extinction) and no con-\ndition on the Ly\u03b1 flux or EW. The model predicts a median EW\n\u2248 20A\u02da for this case, very similar to the typical EW of the emis-\nsion component of Ly\u03b1 in the Shapley et al. sample. The shape\nof the model EW distribution (which is restricted to EW > 0) is\nalso very similar to that found by Shapley et al. for EW > 0 (see\ntheir Fig.8). However, without including a calculation of Ly\u03b1 ab-\nsorption in our model, we cannot make a more detailed comparison\nwith Shapley et al. . Since a calculation of Ly\u03b1 absorption requires\na treatment of radiative transfer through the galaxy ISM, we defer\nthis to a future paper.\nSince our model allows us to estimate Ly\u03b1 EWs, we can\nalso estimate the effect on the Ly\u03b1 luminosity function of im-\nposing different lower limits on the EWs of Ly\u03b1 emission from\ngalaxies. This is shown in Fig.4, for rest-frame EW thresholds\nEWmin(rest) = 0, 20, 40 and 100A\u02da, for redshifts z = 3 and\nz = 6. Different observational surveys for LAEs impose differ-\nent lower limits on the EWs of the objects they include. However,\nfor most of the observational data plotted in Fig.2, the lower limit\nis around EWmin(rest) = 20A\u02da. We see from Fig.4 that an EW\nthreshold around this value is predicted to have only a small ef-\nfect on the Ly\u03b1 luminosity function, so the conclusions we drew\nfrom the comparison with observational data in Fig.2 would not be\nsignificantly affected.\n4.2 Broad-band magnitudes\nAnother important test for our model of the Ly\u03b1 emitters is that it\nshould predict the correct stellar continuum as measured in broad-\nband filters. Fig.5 shows the model predictions for the median\nbroad-band magnitudes as a function of Ly\u03b1 flux at three differ-\nent redshifts, z = 3, 5.7 and 6.55, and for three different broad-\nband filters, the Ic, i\u2032 and z\u2032 filters on the Suprime Cam on the\nSubaru Telescope. (We chose these particular filters because most\nof the observational data we will compare with were taken with\nthem.) The predicted broad-band magnitudes include the effects of\ndust extinction and of attenuation by the intervening IGM (based\non Madau 1995). The evolution with redshift of the predicted Ic\nand i\u2032 magnitudes at a given Ly\u03b1 flux which is seen in Fig.5 results\nmostly from the IGM opacity. In some cases, the Ly\u03b1 emission\nline falls within the bandpass of the filter. We have therefore com-\nputed broad-band magnitudes due to either the stellar continuum\nonly (shown by dashed lines), or to the stellar continuum and Ly\u03b1\nemission line together (shown by solid lines). In most of the cases\nplotted in Fig.5, the solid and dashed lines are indistinguishable,\nbut in a few cases there is a small offset, showing that the Ly\u03b1 line\nmakes a modest contribution to the broad-band magnitude in these\ncases.\nFor comparison, we also plot in Fig.5 a selection of obser-\nvational data for galaxies at z \u223c 5 \u2212 7 from the following pa-\npers: Ellis et al. (2001), Ajiki et al. (2003), Stanway et al. (2004)\nand Taniguchi et al. (2005). The data we plot constrain the stel-\nlar continuum at wavelengths \u223c 900 \u2212 1400A\u02da in the galaxy rest-\nframe. The Ellis et al. and Stanway et al. data were actually taken\non HST using the WFPC2 (I814 filter) and ACS (i\u2032 and z\u2032 filters)\ncameras respectively, but we have verified that the difference of\nthese filters from the Subaru filters (in particular, the difference of\nI814 from Ic) does not significantly affect the comparison of mod-\nels with data which we make here. In cases where the observational\npapers have tried to correct the broad-band magnitudes for the con-\ntribution from the Ly\u03b1 line, we have plotted the total magnitude\nbefore this correction was made. We plot the observational data in\nFig.5 as symbols of the same colour as the model curve closest in\nredshift. Apart from Ellis et al. , all of the samples contain more\n8 Le Delliou et al.\nFigure 5. Broad-band magnitudes as a function of Ly\u03b1 flux. The lines show\nthe model predictions for three different redshifts, z = 3, 5.7 and 6.55, in\ndifferent colours. The dashed lines show the median magnitude due to the\nstellar continuum only, while the solid lines include also the contribution\nof the Ly\u03b1 line to the broad-band magnitude. Where the dashed line is not\nvisible, it coincides with the solid line. The error bars on the lines show\nthe 10-90 percentile range. For clarity, small offsets in the x-direction have\nbeen applied to the model relations for different redshifts. The top, mid-\ndle and lower panels show results for the Ic, i\u2032 and z\u2032 filters respectively.\nThe symbols show observational data, plotted in the same colours as the\nmodel curve closest in redshift. The observational data are as follows: El-\nlis - Ellis et al. (2001) (1 galaxy); Ajiki - Ajiki et al. (2003) (20 galaxies);\nStanway - Stanway et al. (2004) (3 galaxies); Taniguchi - Taniguchi et al.\n(2005) (9 galaxies). For samples with > 1 galaxy, we plot an estimate of\nthe median Ly\u03b1 flux and broad-band magnitude, and of the 10-90 percentile\nranges in both (shown by error bars).\nthan one galaxy, and in these cases we estimate the median and\n10-90% percentile range for both the Ly\u03b1 flux and the broad-band\nmagnitude (allowing for upper limits on the broad-band fluxes). We\nplot the symbol at the median value and show the 10-90% range by\nerror bars. If the 10% value is an upper limit, we indicate this by a\nvery long downwards error bar.\nWe see from Fig.5 that there is mostly good agreement be-\ntween the predicted broad-band magnitudes and the observational\ndata. The one exception is that the median i\u2032 magnitude measured\nfrom Taniguchi et al. (2005) for galaxies at z = 6.55 is nearly\n3 magnitudes brighter than what our model predicts, even though\nthe z\u2032 magnitudes for the same observational sample agree very\nwell with the model predictions. However, 7 out of 9 objects in the\nTaniguchi et al. sample are detected in the i\u2032 band at less than 2\u03c3\nsignificance, so it is possible that the symbol marking our estimate\nof their median magnitude is biased high by statistical errors. We\nnote that at redshift z = 6.55, the i\u2032-band flux is sensitive to emis-\nsion at wavelengths \u223c 900 \u2212 1100A\u02da in the galaxy rest-frame, so\nit is expected to be greatly attenuated by Ly\u03b1 absorption by neu-\ntral hydrogen in the intervening IGM. In contrast, the flux in the z\u2032\nband at this redshift is expected to be much less affected by IGM\nattenuation. Thus, an alternative possible explanation for the dis-\nagreement between the model and the Taniguchi et al. i\u2032 data is\nthat we over-estimate the degree of IGM attenuation at this redshift\nwhen we calculate it using the Madau (1995) formula.\n4.3 Sizes of Ly\u03b1 emitters\nOur semi-analytical model predicts the half-mass radii for the disk\nand bulge components of each galaxy. From these we can compute\nthe half-mass radius of the stars, and also half-light radii in differ-\nent bands, allowing for different colours of the disk and bulge, but\nassuming that both components have internally uniform colours.\nCoenda et al. (2005, in preparation) will present predictions from\nour model for the sizes of galaxies selected by their stellar contin-\nuum emission, and compare with observational data over the red-\nshift range 0 < z < 6. Cole et al. (2000) have discussed pre-\ndictions for galaxy sizes at z = 0 based on an earlier version of\nour semi-analytical model. In the present paper, we will only con-\nsider the sizes of galaxies selected to be Ly\u03b1 emitters. We empha-\nsize that we are not considering in this paper the properties of Ly\u03b1\nblobs (e.g. Matsuda et al. 2004), which are much more spatially\nextended than typical Ly\u03b1 emitters, and appear to be a distinct class\nof object.\nIn Fig.6(a), we show model predictions for the median stel-\nlar half-mass radius (together with its 10-90 percentile range) as a\nfunction of Ly\u03b1 luminosity for several different redshifts, z = 3,\n5, 6 and 7. We have also calculated model half-light radii in the\nrest-frame UV, and the results are almost identical to those for\nthe half-mass radius for these redshifts and luminosities. The stel-\nlar sizes are predicted to be quite compact at these redshifts, .\n1h\u22121kpc. We see that, as well as a correlation of size with luminos-\nity (roughly as R1\/2 \u221d L1\/3), the models also predict that the me-\ndian radius at a given luminosity should decrease with increasing\nredshift (roughly as (1+z)\u22121 or (1+z)\u22121.5). At a fixed Ly\u03b1 lumi-\nnosity of 1042.5h\u22122erg s\u22121 (the typical value in the higher-redshift\nsurveys shown in Fig.2), the median half mass radius shrinks from\n\u223c 1h\u22121kpc at z = 3 to \u223c 0.5h\u22121kpc at z = 7.\nWe have also plotted in Fig.6(a) some observational estimates\nof sizes for individual Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies at z \u223c 5 \u2212 7, plot-\nted in the same colour as the model curve closest in redshift, for\nthree different samples: Stanway et al. (2004) used HST to mea-\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 9\nsure half-light radii in the rest-frame UV of 3 LAEs; Ellis et al.\n(2001) used HST to measure the rest-frame UV size of a single\nstrongly gravitationally lensed LAE; and Taniguchi et al. (2005)\nused ground-based narrow-band imaging to estimate the sizes of\nthe Ly\u03b1-emitting region in 9 LAEs. We see that the Stanway et al.\n(2004) data agree very well with our model predictions, but the\nEllis et al. (2001) galaxy is much smaller than the median pre-\ndicted by our model at that luminosity and redshift. However,\nthe Ellis et al. (2001) datapoint is more uncertain than those of\nStanway et al. (2004), because it relies on the analysis of a highly\ngravitationally amplified and distorted image. We also see that the\nsizes of the Ly\u03b1-emitting regions estimated by Taniguchi et al.\n(2005) are typically \u223c 2 times larger than the model prediction\nfor the stellar half-mass radius at the same luminosity. This might\nbe because the Ly\u03b1 emission in these high-redshift LAEs really is\nmore extended than the stellar distribution. This has been found to\nbe the case in some local starburst galaxies by Mas-Hesse et al.\n(2003), who explain this as resulting from scattering of Ly\u03b1 by\nneutral gas around these galaxies. Alternatively, it is possible that\nTaniguchi et al. have over-estimated the sizes of their galaxies,\nwhich are barely spatially resolved in their ground-based images.\nIn Fig.6(b) we show predictions for the angular sizes of Ly\u03b1-\nemitters as a function of Ly\u03b1 flux, for redshifts over the range\nz = 3 \u2212 20. (We again use the stellar half-mass radius as our\nmeasure of the size.) We see that the relation between angular size\nand flux evolves rather little with redshift, even though the relation\nbetween physical size and luminosity does evolve appreciably. Pre-\ndicted angular sizes are typically\u223c 0.1 arcseconds for fluxes in the\nobserved range.\n5 PREDICTED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF LY\u03b1\nEMITTERS\nOne of the main strengths of semi-analytical modelling lies in the\nability of the models to make predictions for a wide range of galaxy\nproperties. Some of these predictions can be tested directly against\nobservations, as we saw in the previous section. Others can be\ntested indirectly, for example through the interpretation of mea-\nsurements of clustering. Finally, some predictions serve to illustrate\nhow a subset of galaxies highlighted by a particular observational\nselection fit into the overall galaxy population. In this section we\npresent some additional predictions of the model that characterize\nthe Ly\u03b1 emitters.\nFig.7 shows model predictions for different physical proper-\nties as a function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity. In each panel, we show the\npredictions at z = 3, 5 and 7. We plot the median value of the re-\nspective quantity and indicate the spread in the predicted values by\nshowing the 10-90 percentile range, apart from the plot of cluster-\ning bias, where we show only the mean value.\nFigure 6. The sizes of Ly\u03b1 emitters. (a) The top panel shows the physical\nsizes of Ly\u03b1 emitters as a function of their Ly\u03b1 luminosities. The lines show\nmodel predictions for the median stellar half-mass radius for four different\nredshifts, z = 3, 5, 6 and 7. The error bars show the 10-90 percentile range\nat a given luminosity. The symbols show observational estimates of galaxy\nradii, from Ellis et al. (2001), Stanway et al. (2004) and Taniguchi et al.\n(2005), plotted for individual galaxies in the same colours as the model\ncurve closest in redshift (see text for more details). (b) The lower panel\nshows predicted angular sizes as a function of Ly\u03b1 flux, for the redshifts\nz = 3, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20. The sizes plotted are again stellar half-mass\nradii.\n10 Le Delliou et al.\n5.1 Halo masses\nThe upper left panel of Fig.7 shows the masses of the dark matter\nhalos hosting Ly\u03b1 emitters. We see that at z = 3, there is only a\nweak dependence of median halo mass on Ly\u03b1 luminosity, while\nat z = 7, the dependence is much stronger. At a given luminos-\nity, the typical halo mass decreases with increasing redshift, with\nthis trend being stronger at lower luminosities. As discussed in\n\u00a75.5 below, the Ly\u03b1 luminosity traces the instantaneous star for-\nmation rate (SFR) quite well in our model, but with a ratio which\nis \u223c 10 times larger for bursting compared to quiescent galaxies,\nbecause of the difference in IMFs. There are two main reasons for\nthe weak dependence of halo mass on Ly\u03b1 luminosity at the lower\nredshifts: (a) the bursts introduce a large scatter into the relation\nbetween instantaneous SFR and object mass, especially at lower\nredshifts; (b) the shift from being dominated by bursts at high Ly\u03b1\nluminosities to being dominated by quiescent disks at lower lumi-\nnosities flattens the trend of SFR with Ly\u03b1 luminosity, which tends\nto hide the underlying trend of halo mass with SFR. Current Ly\u03b1\nsurveys probe objects with luminosities \u223c 1042.5h\u22122erg s\u22121 over\nthe whole redshift range z \u223c 3\u22127, for which the typical halo mass\n\u223c 1011h\u22121M\u2299, declining by a factor \u223c 3 from z = 3 to z = 7.\n5.2 Clustering bias\nThe halo masses of LAEs can be constrained observationally from\nmeasurements of their clustering. Since the predicted halo masses\nfor typical observed LAEs are larger than the characteristic halo\nmass at each redshift, we expect the LAEs to be more strongly\nclustered than the dark matter. We have used the halo masses pre-\ndicted by the model to calculate the linear clustering bias b, which\nis expected to describe the clustering on large scales, using the for-\nmula of Sheth, Mo & Tormen (2001). We calculate a mean bias\nfor objects in each range of luminosity. This mean bias is shown in\nthe upper right panel of Fig.7. Over the luminosity range LLy\u03b1 =\n1040 \u2212 1043h\u22122erg s\u22121, our model predicts that the bias increases\nwith redshift at fixed luminosity. At z = 3, we predict b \u2248 2 over\nthis luminosity range, increasing only very slightly with luminos-\nity. At z = 7, the bias is predicted to vary much more strongly\nwith luminosity, from b \u2248 3 at LLy\u03b1 = 1040h\u22122erg s\u22121 to b \u2248 6\nat 1043h\u22122erg s\u22121. These predictions for the clustering of LAEs\nseem generally consistent with current observational constraints.\nThe most reliable measurement of the clustering of LAEs to date\nis probably that of Ouchi et al. (2005), since their sample covers\nby far the largest comoving volume. For galaxies at z = 5.7 with\nLy\u03b1 luminosities \u223c 1042h\u22122erg s\u22121, they find a large-scale clus-\ntering bias b = 3.4\u00b11.8. For the same redshift and luminosity, our\nmodel predicts b \u2248 4, in excellent agreement with this measure-\nment. At somewhat lower redshifts, z \u2248 4.8, somewhat conflicting\nresults have been obtained for the clustering (e.g. Ouchi et al 2003;\nShimasaku et al. 2003, 2004; Hamana et al. 2004), however, these\nhave been obtained from much smaller survey volumes. In partic-\nular, Shimasaku et al. (2004) measure very different clustering in\ntheir two approximately equal survey volumes at z = 4.8, showing\nthat the surveys used were not large enough to reliably measure the\naverage clustering.\n5.3 Stellar masses\nThe middle left panel of Fig.7 shows the predicted stellar masses of\nLAEs as a function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity. The trends of stellar mass\nwith luminosity and redshift are similar to those already discussed\nfor the halo mass: the trend of stellar mass with luminosity steep-\nens with increasing redshift, and the mass at a given luminosity\ndecreases with increasing redshift. The reasons for the rather flat\ntrend of stellar mass with Ly\u03b1 luminosity at the lower redshifts are\nthe same as those already given for the halo mass. For a luminosity\nLLy\u03b1 = 10\n42.5h\u22122erg s\u22121, the median stellar mass is predicted to\ndecrease from \u223c 109h\u22121M\u2299 at z = 3 to \u223c 3 \u00d7 107h\u22121M\u2299 at\nz = 7.\nThere have not yet been any observational estimates of the\nstellar masses of LAEs, but the values predicted by our model\nare rather lower than the stellar masses inferred observationally\nfor some other classes of high-redshift galaxies. Shapley et al.\n(2001) estimated stellar masses of Lyman-break galaxies at z \u223c 3\nfrom broad-band photometry, and found a median stellar mass \u223c\n1010h\u22121M\u2299 in a sample with median magnitude RAB \u223c 24 (sim-\nilar results were also found by Papovich, Dickinson & Ferguson\n2001). In contrast, typical observed LAEs at z \u223c 3 with LLy\u03b1 \u223c\n1042h\u22122erg s\u22121 are predicted by our model to have stellar masses\n\u223c 109h\u22121M\u2299. The difference could be explained by a combi-\nnation of two effects: (a) The LAEs at z \u223c 3 with LLy\u03b1 \u223c\n1042h\u22122erg s\u22121 typically have fainter continuum magnitudes (by\n1-2 mag) than the Shapley et al. LBGs. (b) The photometric esti-\nmates of the stellar masses of LBGs depend strongly on the IMF\nassumed, because the mass-to-light ratio of a stellar population is\nvery sensitive to the IMF; Shapley et al. assumed a Salpeter IMF,\nbut if instead they had assumed a top-heavy IMF as in starbursts in\nour model, then they might have derived lower masses.\nThe issue of how photometric estimates of the stellar masses\nof high-redshift galaxies depend on the assumed IMF is an im-\nportant one, but is also complicated, because these estimates in-\nvolve fitting multi-parameter models (varying age, star formation\nhistory, metallicity and dust extinction) to multi-band photometric\ndata, in order to estimate the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar pop-\nulation. Most such studies have simply assumed a Salpeter IMF.\nPapovich, Dickinson & Ferguson (2001) considered the effects on\nphotometric mass estimates of varying the lower mass limit on the\nIMF, but did not consider IMF slopes different from the solar neigh-\nbourhood value. We plan to address this issue in more detail in a\nfuture paper.\n5.4 Metallicities\nThe middle right panel of Fig.7 shows the metallicity of the cold\ngas in LAEs as a function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity. We see that in most\ncases, the gas metallicity is appreciable, \u223c 10\u22122 (i.e. comparable\nto solar), even at high redshifts. This reflects the fact that galax-\nies are able to self-enrich to metallicities \u223c Z\u2299 even when the\nmean metallicity of all baryons in the universe is much lower than\nthis. In our model, the quiescent galaxies are predicted to show\na well-defined trend of metallicity increasing with luminosity (as\nalready found for z = 0 galaxies by Cole et al. 2000), which pro-\nduces the decline in metallicity at low luminosities seen in Fig.7\nfor z = 3 and z = 5. However, the bursts show a more com-\nplicated behaviour, with the median metallicity being flat or even\nnon-monotonic with luminosity, which is reflected in the behaviour\nseen in Fig.7 for z = 7 and for higher luminosities at z = 3 and\nz = 5.\n5.5 Star formation rates\nThe lower left panel of Fig.7 shows the instantaneous star forma-\ntion rates in LAEs as a function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity. The star for-\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 11\nFigure 7.

The lines show the median values of the respective properties (apart from panel (b) which shows the mean) and the error bars\nshow the 10-90 percentile range. (a) The upper left panel shows the mass of the dark matter halo hosting the emitter. (b) The upper right panel shows the mean\nclustering bias. (c) The middlle left panel shows the stellar mass.

(f) The lower right panel shows the UV continuum luminosity at a rest-frame wavelength of 1500A\u02da.\n12 Le Delliou et al.\nmation rates include both the quiescent star formation in galactic\ndisks and the contribution of any ongoing starbursts. If we look at\neither quiescent galaxies or bursts separately, then we find a nearly\nlinear relation SFR \u221d LLy\u03b1, but with a proportionality constant\nwhich is \u223c 10 times larger for the quiescent galaxies, because\nof the difference in IMFs. For a galaxy which has been forming\nstars at a contant rate for 108yr, we predict a relation LLy\u03b1 =\n(1.1, 12) \u00d7 1042erg s\u22121fesc(SFR\/M\u2299yr\n\u22121) for the Kennicutt\nand x = 0 IMFs respectively (for solar metallicity), and quies-\ncent and bursting galaxies in our model separately lie quite close\nto one or other relation. In Fig.7 we see a shallower relation than\nSFR \u221d LLy\u03b1 in some cases, which results from a gradual transi-\ntion from being dominated by bursts at high luminosities to being\ndominated by quiescently star-forming galaxies at low luminosi-\nties. For LAEs with luminosities \u223c 1042.5h\u22122erg s\u22121 (which are\ndominated by bursts), our model predicts SFRs\u223c 10h\u22121M\u2299yr\u22121.\nWe note that comparing the SFRs predicted by our model with pub-\nlished values estimated from observational data is not straightfor-\nward, because different authors (a) assume different values for the\nLy\u03b1 escape fraction (often taking fesc = 1), and (b) assume differ-\nent IMFs (typically using a Salpeter IMF).\n5.6 UV continuum luminosities\nThe lower right panel of Fig.7 shows the UV continuum lumi-\nnosity L\u03bd(1500A\u02da) at a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1500A\u02da as\na function of Ly\u03b1 luminosity. This plot contains similar informa-\ntion to Fig.5, but now, for convenience, in terms of luminosities,\nand at a fixed rest-frame wavelength in the UV. The predicted re-\nlation between UV and Ly\u03b1 luminosities is roughly linear. This is\nwhat one would expect if one had a universal IMF and no dust at-\ntenuation, since both the UV and Ly\u03b1 luminosities are driven by\nrecent star formation. For a galaxy which has been forming stars\nat a contant rate for 108yr, we predict an unattenuated relation\nL\u03bd(1500A\u02da) = (0.98, 3.8) \u00d7 10\n28erg s\u22121Hz\u22121(SFR\/M\u2299yr\n\u22121)\nfor the Kennicutt and x = 0 IMFs respectively, for solar metallic-\nity. However, dust extinction is predicted to have a large effect on\nUV luminosities in our model, reducing them by a factor \u223c 10 in\nthe brighter objects. The average UV extinction in the models in-\ncreases with luminosity in both bursts and quiescent galaxies, and\nis also larger in quiescent than bursting objects (at a given SFR).\nThe unattenuated UV\/Ly\u03b1 luminosity ratio is also predicted to de-\ncrease by a factor 3 going from quiescent objects at low luminosity\nto bursts at high luminosity as a result of the change in the IMF.\nThese effects all combine to leave a relation between UV and Ly\u03b1\nluminosities which is shifted but still roughly linear.\nThe UV and Ly\u03b1 luminosities are both used in estimating star\nformation rates for observed high-redshift galaxies. However, both\nsuffer from the drawback that they are affected by large but un-\ncertain dust attenuation factors. In the model presented here, the\ndust attenuation is larger by a factor \u223c 10 for the Ly\u03b1 than for the\nUV luminosity, so by that criterion, the UV luminosity should be\na more reliable quantitative star formation indicator. However, we\ncaution that the Ly\u03b1 attenuation factor fesc which we use was not\nobtained from a detailed radiative transfer calculation, unlike the\nUV dust extinction.\n6 THE ABUNDANCE OF LY\u03b1 EMITTERS AT Z > 7\nPaper I presented predictions for the abundance of Ly\u03b1 emitters as\na function of flux for the redshift range 2 . z . 7 which is acces-\nFigure 8. Predictions for the number of Ly\u03b1 emitters at very high redshifts.\n(a) The upper panel shows the evolution of the cumulative Ly\u03b1 luminosity\nfunction at 6 6 z 6 20, for our standard model, with reionization redshift\nzreion = 10 and Ly\u03b1 escape fraction fesc = 0.02. (b) The middle panel\nshows the predicted number counts per unit redshift interval per unit solid\nangle as a cumulative function of the Ly\u03b1 flux, for zreion = 10. Results are\nshown for two different escape fractions, our standard value fesc = 0.02\n(solid lines) and a larger value fesc = 0.2 (dashed lines). We show number\ncounts for selected redshifts falling within either the J,H or K atmospheric\ntransmission windows, with different redshifts in different colours. (c) The\nlower panel shows the cumulative number counts as in (b), for our standard\nfesc = 0.02, and three different reionization redshifts, zreion = 6.5 (dot-\nted lines), 10 (solid lines) and 20 (dashed lines); where the dotted lines are\nnot visible, they coincide with the solid lines. The number counts do not\ninclude attenuation by the IGM.\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 13\nsible from observations at optical wavelengths. The highest redshift\nat which LAEs have been found in surveys up to now is z = 6.6.\nAt even higher redshifts, the Ly\u03b1 line moves into the near-IR as\nseen from the Earth. Therefore, searching for LAEs at z & 7 re-\nquires observing in the near-IR, which is technically challenging.\nSeveral such searches are underway (e.g. Willis & Courbin 2005;\nStark & Ellis 2005), and others will start in the near future (e.g.\nHorton et al. 2004). Therefore in this section we present some pre-\ndictions for the number of LAEs which should be found in near-IR\nsearches, at redshifts 7 . z . 20. Barton et al. (2004) have pre-\nviously made predictions for the number of LAEs at z \u2248 8 based\non a numerical simulation, but assumed a 100% escape fraction for\nLy\u03b1 photons (i.e. fesc = 1). Thommes & Meisenheimer (2005)\nhave also made predictions for z > 7, but for a phenomenological\nmodel not based on CDM.\nThe upper panel of Fig.8 shows what our standard model,\nwith reionization redshift zreion = 10 and Ly\u03b1 escape fraction\nfesc = 0.02, predicts for the evolution of the luminosity function of\nLAEs at 6 6 z 6 20. We see that the luminosity function declines\nsignificantly at the bright end from z \u223c 6 to z \u223c 10, and then de-\nclines with redshift very rapidly at all luminosities at z & 10. This\ndecline is driven by the reduction in star formation with increasing\nredshift, which results from the build-up of cosmic structure over\ntime.\nThe middle and lower panels of Fig.8 show the predicted\nnumber counts per unit solid angle per unit redshift as a cumu-\nlative function of the Ly\u03b1 flux. These predictions do not include\nthe attenuation of the Ly\u03b1 flux by neutral gas in the interven-\ning IGM, as we discuss below. We show predictions for redshifts\nz = 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16, chosen such that the Ly\u03b1 line falls within\neither the J, H or K atmospheric window. (The J, H and K at-\nmospheric windows cover the wavelength ranges 1.08-1.35, 1.51-\n1.80 and 1.97-2.38 \u00b5m respectively, corresponding to Ly\u03b1 redshift\nranges z = 7.9\u221210.1, 11.4\u221213.8 and 15.2\u221218.6.) Ground-based\nsearches in the near-IR are likely to concentrate on these atmo-\nspheric windows, because the atmospheric opacity at other near-IR\nwavelengths is extremely high. We have already shown predicted\nangular sizes for these galaxies in Fig.6(b).\nThe middle panel of Fig.8 shows how the predicted number\ncounts depend on the assumed Ly\u03b1 escape fraction fesc. We show\nresults for our standard value of the reionization redshift zreion =\n10, but for two values of fesc, 0.02 (our standard value) and 0.2.\nWe recall that the value of fesc was originally chosen in order to\nmatch the observed counts at z \u223c 3, and turns out to provide a good\nmatch to observations over the whole range 3 < z < 6.6. At higher\nredshifts, no empirical calibration of fesc is available. Since we do\nnot have a detailed physical model for fesc, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that the value at very high redshifts is different from the\nvalue at lower redshifts. As might be expected, the number counts\nat a given flux are quite sensitive to the value of fesc. Predicted\ncounts for other values of fesc than those shown in Fig.8 can easily\nbe obtained by scaling the curves in the horizontal direction with\nfesc, since the flux from each galaxy is proportional to fesc.\nThe lower panel of Fig.8 shows how the predicted number\ncounts depend on the assumed reionization redshift zreion. As was\ndiscussed in Section 2, observations of Gunn-Peterson absorption\ntroughs in QSO spectra suggest that the IGM became fully reion-\nized at z \u223c 6 (Becker et al. 2001), while the WMAP measurement\nof the polarization of the microwave background implies that the\nIGM has been mostly reionized since z \u223c 20 (Kogut et al. 2003).\nWe therefore show predictions for zreion = 6.5 and 20, in addition\nto our standard value zreion = 10. In all three cases we assume\nfesc = 0.02. In our model, reionization is assumed to affect galaxy\nformation in the following way: the IGM is assumed to be instanta-\nneously reionized and reheated at z = zreion, and at z < zreion, the\nthermal pressure of the IGM is assumed to prevent gas collapsing\nin all dark halos with circular velocities Vc < 60km s\u22121. This sim-\nple behaviour is an approximation to what was found in more de-\ntailed calculations by Benson et al. (2002). The dependence of the\nnumber counts on zreion shown in Fig.8 results entirely from this\neffect of reionization on galaxy formation, since we ignore the IGM\nopacity here. For z > zreion, all models look identical to the case\nin which the IGM never reionized, but for z < zreion, the number\ncounts are suppressed relative to the no-reionization case. We see\nthat the predicted counts for the redshift ranges and fluxes shown\nin Fig.8 differ only slightly for zreion = 6.5 and zreion = 10, but\nfor zreion = 20, the predicted counts are much lower, except for\nthe bright counts at z \u223c 8\u2212 10.\nHowever, as noted earlier, there is an important caveat to our\nresults: our model includes the attenuation of the stellar continuum\nlight from galaxies due to Ly\u03b1 scattering and Lyc absorption by\natomic hydrogen in the intervening IGM, but we do not include\nany attenuation of the flux in the Ly\u03b1 line due to Ly\u03b1 scattering\nin the IGM. At z > zreion, when the IGM is completely neu-\ntral, this attenuation of the Ly\u03b1 line flux could potentially be very\nlarge, which would greatly decrease the number counts at a given\nflux. IGM attenuation will therefore produce a trend in the number\ncounts with zreion in the opposite sense to the feedback of reioniza-\ntion on galaxy formation: at z < zreion, the feedback effect tends\nto suppress the counts, but the IGM attenuation will be removed,\nwhich will increase the counts relative to a model in which the IGM\nis still neutral at that redshift.\nThe amount of attenuation of the Ly\u03b1 line by the IGM before\nreionization is theoretically very uncertain. Miralda-Escude (1998)\nshowed that for a galaxy at high redshift embedded in a neutral\nIGM moving with the Hubble flow, emitting a Ly\u03b1 line centred at\nits rest-frame wavelength in the frame of the galaxy, scattering by\natomic hydrogen in the IGM would suppress the blue wing of the\nLy\u03b1 line completely (reducing the line flux by a factor 2), and also\npartly suppress the red wing due to the Ly\u03b1 damping wings (re-\nducing the line flux even more). However, Madau & Rees (2000)\nand Haiman (2002) showed that this attenuation of the line flux\ncould be greatly reduced due to the galaxy photo-ionizing the IGM\naround it. A more detailed theoretical analysis of the attenuation\nhas been made by Santos (2004), who includes the following ef-\nfects: (i) the intrinsic width of the Ly\u03b1 line emitted by the galaxy,\nand the fact it may be redshifted in the galaxy rest-frame due to\nscattering in a galactic wind; (ii) the non-uniform density profile of\nthe IGM around the galaxy and the departure of the velocity field\nfrom the Hubble flow, due to cosmological infall onto the galaxy;\n(iii) collisional ionization of the gas within the galaxy halo, photo-\nionization of the surrounding IGM by the stellar population, and\nclearing of bubbles in the IGM by galactic winds. Santos finds\nthat a very wide range of attenuation factors is possible in plausi-\nble models, but that if the Ly\u03b1 emission is redshifted in the rest-\nframe of the galaxy (as is observed to be the case in Lyman-break\ngalaxies at z \u223c 3), the amount of attenuation is greatly reduced.\nThe effects on the attenuation of Ly\u03b1 of clustering of galaxies and\nclumping of the IGM have been investigated by Furlanetto et al.\n(2004) Gnedin & Prada (2004), and Wyithe & Loeb (2005); they\nfind that these effects can also significantly reduce the amount of\nattenuation. In summary, for LAEs at z > zreion, the Ly\u03b1 flux is\nlikely to be significantly attenuated by the IGM, but the amount\n14 Le Delliou et al.\nof attenuation is currently uncertain. We plan to investigate this in\nmore detail in a future paper.\nAn unsuccessful search for LAEs at z = 8.8 has been carried\nout by Willis & Courbin (2005), who place an upper limit n .\n3 \u00d7 10\u22123h3Mpc\u22123 on sources with LLy\u03b1 > 1043h\u22122erg s\u22121.\nThis limit on the number density is more than 4 orders of mag-\nnitude higher than the prediction for our standard model shown in\nFig.8(a). Willis et al. (2005) and Stark & Ellis (2005) are carrying\nout surveys for z \u223c 9 LAEs which will probe to lower luminosities\nby using gravitational lensing by foreground clusters. In the near\nfuture, the DAzLE instrument (Horton et al. 2004) on the VLT will\nbegin searches for LAEs at z > 7. It is planned to search for Ly\u03b1\nat z \u2248 7.7 in the first phase, and z \u2248 8.7 in the second phase, in\neach case over a redshift window \u2206z \u2248 0.01; ultimately it may be\npossible to reach z \u2248 14 with the instrument. DAzLE will cover an\narea of \u2206\u2126 = 47 arcmin2 in a single exposure, and is projected\nto reach a 5\u03c3 flux limit of f = 2 \u00d7 10\u221218erg cm\u22122s\u22121 in a 10\nhour integration. We can use our model to predict how many ob-\njects DAzLE should see in a single 10 hour exposure in each of\nthe redshift ranges. For our standard model with zreion = 10 and\nfesc = 0.02, we predict the number of sources per unit redshift\nper unit solid angle above flux f = 2 \u00d7 10\u221218erg cm\u22122s\u22121 to be\nd2N(> f)\/d\u2126dz = (0.58, 0.13) arcmin\u22122 at z = (7.7, 8.7) re-\nspectively, which for the specified \u2206z and \u2206\u2126 corresponds to an\naverage of 0.3 and 0.06 objects per field at z = 7.7 and z = 8.7\nrespectively. Therefore we expect that DAzLE will need to observe\nmany separate fields to find a significant number of high-z Ly\u03b1\nemitters.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have used a detailed semi-analytical model of\ngalaxy formation based on the \u039bCDM cosmology to predict the\nproperties of star-forming Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies over the redshift\nrange 0 6 z 6 20. All except one of the parameters of the model\nwere chosen without reference to the observed properties of Ly\u03b1\nemitters, having instead been chosen in previous work (Cole et al.\n2000; Baugh et al. 2005) to match properties such as the UV, op-\ntical and IR luminosities, sizes, morphological types, gas fractions\nand metallicities of galaxies at low and high redshift. As shown in\nBaugh et al. (2005), our current model, which incorporates a top-\nheavy IMF for stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy merg-\ners, provides a good match to the optical and far-IR luminosity\nfunctions in the local universe, the far-UV luminosity function of\nLyman-break galaxies at z \u223c 3, and the number counts and red-\nshifts of sub-mm galaxies. Our assumption of a top-heavy IMF in\nbursts receives support from studies of the metallicities of ellipti-\ncal galaxies and intracluster gas (Nagashima et al. 2005a,b). The\none free parameter we had in the comparison of our model with\nobservational data on Ly\u03b1 emitters (LAEs) was the fraction fesc of\nLy\u03b1 photons which escape from a galaxy. For simplicity, we have\nassumed that fesc is a constant, irrespective of other galaxy prop-\nerties. In our previous paper on LAEs (Le Delliou et al. 2005), we\nfound that fesc = 0.02 reproduced the abundance of faint LAEs at\nz \u223c 3, and we used the same value in the present paper.\nIn Le Delliou et al. (2005), we presented model predictions\nfor the number counts of LAEs as a function of Ly\u03b1 flux for the\nredshift range 2 6 z 6 6, but made only a very limited comparison\nwith observational data, comparing only with the total counts at the\nlimiting fluxes for different surveys. In this paper, we have made\na much more detailed comparison of the model with observations,\ncomparing predicted and observed Ly\u03b1 luminosity functions over\nthe range 3 6 z 6 7. The most important result of this paper is\nthat, with our very simple assumption of a constant Ly\u03b1 escape\nfraction, the model reproduces the observed luminosity functions,\nboth in shape and in the evolution with redshift.\nWe have also compared the predictions of our model with\nother observed properties of LAEs. We have made a comparison\nof predicted and observed Ly\u03b1 equivalent widths (EWs). We find\nthat the typical predicted EWs are similar to those found in ob-\nservational surveys, and that the predicted distribution of EWs at\na given Ly\u03b1 flux is very broad once we include the effect of dust\nextinction, with a peak at 0 and a tail to large values. If we se-\nlect galaxies in the model according to their continuum magnitudes\nrather than their Ly\u03b1 fluxes, then we predict a distribution of EWs\nwhich is similar to what has been found observationally for Lyman-\nbreak galaxies at z \u223c 3, when we restrict the comparison to galax-\nies where Ly\u03b1 is seen in emission. We have compared predicted\nand observed broad-band magnitudes (corresponding to rest-frame\nUV luminosities) for galaxies selected by their Ly\u03b1 fluxes, and find\nmostly good agreement. We have also compared the predicted sizes\nof LAEs with the limited existing observational data, and find rea-\nsonable consistency for the stellar half-light radii.\nWe have also used our model to try to better understand the\nnature of the objects selected in Ly\u03b1 emission-line surveys, and\nhow they relate to other classes of high-redshift galaxies. We have\nmade predictions for the dark halo and stellar masses, the star for-\nmation rates and the gas metallicities for LAEs at different red-\nshifts, properties which are physically fundamental, but for which\nwe do not yet have direct observational measurements. The pre-\ndicted halo masses imply values of the clustering bias which seem\nquite consistent with existing measurements of the large-scale clus-\ntering of LAEs. Better observational characterization of the cluster-\ning of LAEs at different redshifts would provide a very important\ntest of our model.\nFinally, we have presented predictions for how many Ly\u03b1\nemitters should be seen at z > 7, a redshift range for which no\nLAEs have yet been found, but which is now opening up for obser-\nvational study, thanks to advances in near-IR instrumentation. De-\ntection of LAEs in this redshift range would be very exciting both\nfor probing the early stages of galaxy formation and the epoch of\nreionization. A problem for making predictions for LAEs at z > 7\nis that the redshift at which the IGM reionized is uncertain, being\nobservationally constrained to be in the range 6.5 . zreion . 20.\nThis affects predictions for galaxies seen at z > zreion, since the\nLy\u03b1 flux is expected to be significantly attenuated by propagation\nthrough a neutral IGM, but by an uncertain amount which depends\non many factors. We have made detailed predictions for how many\nobjects could be seen using the DAzLE instrument, which begins\noperation soon, at z \u2248 7.7 and z \u2248 8.7. We find that, even if the\nattenuation by the IGM is modest at these redshifts, then finding\nLAEs with DAzLE will require observation of a large number of\nfields.\nThe most important theoretical limitations of our present work\nare that it does not incorporate a detailed physical model for the\nescape of Ly\u03b1 photons from galaxies, and that we do not include\na treatment of the attenuation of Ly\u03b1 fluxes by the IGM prior to\nreionization. We plan to address these issues in future papers.\nThe properties of Ly\u03b1-emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation models 15\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Kim-Vy Tran and Simon Lilly for providing us with their\nluminosity function compilations in convenient form.
