If dunes can be accurately aged, they are useful as a \nmodel system for studying the basic processes governing soil development, and in particular \nthe balance between climate effects and local factors.  \nSoil development is broadly controlled by three principal factors: climate, the soil parent \nmaterial, and vegetation type. Temperature and rainfall exert a major influence on soil \ndevelopment. Rainfall drives leaching rates and the rate of decalcification (Wilson 1960). \nTogether they govern rates of plant growth, with the balance between rainfall and evaporation \nbeing particularly important in dune systems (Sevink 1991). Both temperature and soil \nmoisture exert complex controls on the rate of decomposition of organic matter (McLaren \nand Cameron 1990), with slower decomposition and therefore faster soil development \ngenerally occurring in wetter and in cooler environments. Vegetation type also plays a role. \nThe chemical composition of plant litter, particularly the C:N ratio and the quantity of \nrecalcitrant compounds such as lignin and complex organic molecules strongly affect rates of \ndecomposition (Berg et al. 1998; O'Neill and Norby 1996), while plant productivity controls \nthe supply of organic matter to the soil. Most semi-natural systems, and particularly early \nsuccessional systems, are nitrogen limited (Vitousek et al. 1997), although phosphorus \nlimitation can also be important in calcareous dune systems (Kooijman and Besse 2002; \nKooijman et al. 1998). Where nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient, additional supply \nincreases plant productivity (Berendse 1998) and reduces the C:N ratio of litter which usually \nacts to speed up mineralisation rates (Berendse 1998). However, the long term effects of N on \nsoil development are poorly understood. Other factors more intrinsic to rates of soil \ndevelopment in younger dune soils include the height above the water table - leading to great \ndifferentiation between soil development rates in dry dunes and rates in dune slacks, the \ninitial carbonate content of the sand, the frequency of disturbance, the management regime, \nclimate factors such as windspeed and direction and physical factors which modify \nmicroclimate such as slope and aspect (Gerlach et al. 1994; Grootjans et al. 1998). While all \nthese factors affect soil development, the balance between broad-scale and local influences \non soil development is poorly understood. \n \nSoil development is a slow process and is not easily directly measured. Soil development is \ntypically studied through chronosequences, over timescales ranging from a few decades \n(Berendse et al. 1998; Ernst et al. 1996; Lammerts et al. 1999; Olff et al. 1993) to hundreds \n(Gerlach et al. 1994; Salisbury 1922; 1925; Wilson 1960) and even thousands of years (Olson \n1958a; b; Syers et al. 1970). Types of chronosequence available in dunes include sampling \nlandforms resulting from successive phases of dune mobility, successive dune ridges laid \ndown on prograding coasts (Salisbury 1925; Wilson 1960) and chronosequences following \ndisturbance at known time points, for example turf stripping episodes in dune slacks in the \nNetherlands (Berendse et al. 1998; Ernst et al. 1996; Lammerts et al. 1999). Such \nchronosequences provide valuable information about soil development over time, particularly \nwhen backed up by independent dating methods, but also have limitations. Old dune \nlandforms are prone to subsequent disturbance or partial re-mobilisation, soil development \nover time on accreting coasts is partially confounded by increasing distance from the sea as \nthe shoreline progrades, while chronosequences following management often inherit a \nresidual elevated organic matter or soil nutrient content, or soil decalcification (Berendse et \nal. 1998), and hence do not truly re-set the clock.  \n \nHigh resolution aerial photography, available since at least the 1940s for many areas as a \nresult of military activity in the Second World War, allows ages of younger soils to be \n 3\nestimated fairly accurately given a sufficiently detailed photographic record, while the age of \nolder soils can be estimated using conventional historical records and dating techniques. This \ngives a much greater temporal and spatial resolution to the very early stages of soil \ndevelopment. Since soils of different ages will have experienced different climate and \nnitrogen deposition regimes (Berendse et al. 1998) in principle it allows inferences to be \nmade about the factors governing soil development at one site which would only otherwise be \npossible comparing a wide range of sites across a climosequence where it is difficult to \ncontrol for the influence of other factors such as mineralogy, sand supply, etc. and to \naccurately determine soil ages.  \n \nIn order to address the lack of studies focusing on soil development and climate in relatively \nyoung dune soils (Sevink 1991), a detailed chronosequence of soil development was created \nfor a dune system in North Wales, extending to 140 years. The chronosequence was then \nused to address the following hypotheses. Does soil development proceed faster during \nperiods with cooler, wetter average climate conditions? Does soil development proceed faster \nunder higher levels of nitrogen deposition? Does small scale variation in location-specific \nphysico-chemical factors exert a greater influence on soil development than large-scale \nfactors such as climate and N pollution. Lastly, the implications for N and C accumulation in \nearly successional systems are discussed in relation to these findings. \n \n \nMaterials and methods \nOverview \nThis analysis uses data collated under a combination of published and unpublished studies for \nwhich soil data and accurate soil sampling locations were available for Newborough Warren, \na large dune system in North Wales, United Kingdom (Emmett 2007; Jones et al. 2002; Jones \net al. 2004). These data were supplemented by additional sampling of under-represented \nhabitats across a range of soil ages as part of this study, giving 90 data points overall with a \nreasonable geographical spread across the dune complex, and covering the full range of \navailable habitats from younger to older dry dune habitats (42 samples) including mobile and \nsemi-fixed dunes and dune grasslands, and younger to older wet dune habitats (48 samples) \nincluding dune slacks and damp dune grasslands. In dune systems, soil formation consists \nprimarily of the accumulation of organic matter and lacks the accumulation of material from \nweathering of bedrock. Therefore, in this study, the degree of organic matter accumulation is \nused as the measure of soil development, calculated as percentage loss on ignition (%LOI). \n \nSite description \nNewborough Warren is one of the largest UK dune systems, located on the island of \nAnglesey, North Wales, UK (53:08N  4:21W). It is up to 2 km wide and approximately 1300 \nhectares in area, half of which was planted with forest over the period 1949 \u2013 1969. Within \nrecent history the dune system has been highly mobile, with approximately 75 % bare sand in \nthe 1950s, and has progressively stabilised since then with only 6 % bare sand in 1991 (Rhind \net al. 2001; Rhind et al. 2007). The site contains a number of dune ridges with intervening \ndune slack areas and sand plains which presumably formed during different episodes of \nmobility. However, aerial photographs show that most of these surfaces were almost \ncompletely mobile in the 1940s with established vegetation limited to dune slacks, and fixed \ndune grasslands at the edge of the site and in smaller discrete patches across the site. Soil and \nvegetation development has proceeded patchily across the site since the major onset of \nstabilisation in the early 1940s, and reflects local variability in the time of establishment \nrather than a clear succession of habitats of increasing age away from the sea. \n 4\n \nCollection and preparation of soil samples: \nSoil samples from all the previous studies had been collected using the same methodology; \ntaking 5 cm diameter soil cores down to a depth of 15 cm. Supplementary field sampling for \nthis study utilised the same method. Samples were collected in 2002 and 2006, with \nsupplementary sampling conducted in 2007. In the laboratory, samples were homogenised \nand large roots, shells and stones removed. Soil moisture and percentage Loss on Ignition \n(%LOI) were determined at oven temperatures of 105 \u00b0C and 375 \u00b0C respectively for 16 \nhours (MAFF 1986). The oven temperature of 375 \u00b0C is sufficient to combust organic matter \nwithout dissociating too much carbon dioxide from the carbonates (Ball 1964). Total carbon \nand nitrogen contents in the original studies were measured by combustion on a Carlo Erba \nCSN analyser, after acidification to remove carbonates. \n \nEstimating soil age \nAges for soil sampling locations were established using a variety of methods including aerial \nphotographs, Ordnance Survey maps and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dated \nsoils. The data sources and methods are described briefly here but are available in greater \ndetail in Jones et al. (2007). For the younger soils (1940s onwards), aerial photographs were \nused to establish when vegetation cover at each location commenced. A high temporal-\nresolution sequence of aerial photographs was available for Newborough Warren, \npredominantly at a scale of 1:10,000, with some at coarser scale. Soil sample points (GPS co-\nordinates \u00b1 10 m) were matched to locations on ortho-rectified photographs with the aid of \navailable information about the slope, aspect, habitat type and bare sand cover from the \nassociated survey data. Locations were then traced back over time using the full sequence of \nindividual photographs, back to 1945, to identify the progressive colonisation of vegetation. \nVegetation cover at each sampling location was estimated to the nearest 10 %, with bare sand \nscored as 0 % vegetation cover. The high temporal resolution of the aerial photography \nrecord allowed most ages to be estimated to within 5 or 10 years, with T=0 for soil \ndevelopment taken as the mid-point date between the aerial photographs when vegetation \ncover was first apparent on the bare sand, with the dates of the photographs providing bounds \nfor the age estimate.  \n \nMinimum ages of older soils (pre 1940s) were estimated using Ordnance Survey maps \n(1:9600), surveyed in 1887, and revised in 1899 and 1915. A more precise age for one area of \nfixed dune grassland was available from an OSL dating study (Bailey 2004). OSL dates the \nsand below the organic layer, giving a maximum age in this case of 145 \u00b1 15 yrs, which was \nassigned to all points in the contiguous fixed dune grassland near that location.  \n \nGeneral factors affecting soil development: Climate and nitrogen deposition \nA subset of the data (14 dry and 40 wet habitat samples) was prepared covering the period of \nmost rapid soil development. These samples included only those for which reliable age \nestimates were available, based on the photographic record, and exclude all other samples \nincluding the older OSL dated samples. Accumulation rates, expressed as %LOI \naccumulation per year were calculated over the period between reaching 100 % vegetation \ncover and when the soil was sampled, in order to compare rates of organic matter \naccumulation for each data point over time. For each soil sample point, climate variables and \nN deposition were averaged over the same period of soil development. Monthly climate \nrecords going back to 1941 were available for a Royal Air Force Station at Valley, a coastal \nsite 17 km to the north west, and the following climate variables were assessed: Average \nannual rainfall, average, maximum and minimum daily air temperature, number of frost days, \n 5\naverage windspeed, number of days with gale force winds, and Talbot\u2019s Mobility Index (Mo) \n(Talbot 1984), which combines information about windspeed, rainfall and temperature to \nindicate how favourable the conditions are for dune mobility. Where relevant (for rainfall, air \ntemperatures, frost days and gale days), these variables were further broken down to 6-month \nsummer (Apr - Sept) and winter (Oct - Mar) periods, and to 3-month spring (Mar \u2013 May), \nsummer (Jun \u2013 Aug), autumn (Sept \u2013 Nov) and winter (Dec \u2013 Feb) periods in order to further \ndetermine which seasonal climate variables correlate most strongly with soil development. \nAtmospheric nitrogen deposition was reconstructed back to 1941 as follows. A generic \nhistorical reconstruction profile of NHy and NOx deposition for the UK (Fowler et al. 2004) \nwas parameterised for Newborough Warren using oxidised and reduced nitrogen deposition \ndata from Mohd-Said (1999) and unpublished CEH data. While the generic reconstruction \npredicts a decrease in deposition after 1990, recent measurements of NH3 concentration at \nNewborough (CEH, unpublished data) suggest a slight increase. Therefore, in the absence of \ndetailed measurements the deposition profile used here beyond 1999 assumes continuation of \n1999 levels.  \n \nLocation-specific factors affecting soil development, physical, chemical and biological \nparameters. \nIn order to examine the effect of location specific factors on soil development for the same \nsubset of data, associated data where available were collated for each soil sampling location. \nThese included: distance to the sea in the direction of the prevailing winds, calculated in a \nGIS, soil pH measured in both water and CaCl2, and slope of the terrain (degrees).  \n \nData analysis and statistics. \nSoil development curves were prepared by plotting percentage loss on ignition (%LOI) \nagainst soil age. Ages estimated from aerial photographs used the mid-point of the \nphotograph interval, with error bars denoting the age bounds. Older soils with uncertain ages \nwere plotted as minimum estimated age, with a nominal 20-year error bar. OSL dates from \nBailey (2004) were reported \u00b1 15 years, but as they represent a maximum age they are given \na nominal 20-year error bar denoting a possible younger age. \n \nWhen analysing factors affecting rates of soil development, relationships between %LOI yr-1 \nand climate and location-specific environmental variables were assessed using linear \nregression against individual variables. Collinearity between variables was explored using \nprincipal components analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression. Nitrogen accumulation \nrates were calculated from soil N pool data in the original studies. The PCA and all statistical \ntests were conducted in Minitab v 14.1. \n \nResults \nSoil curves \nThe data were separated into dry dune habitats (mobile, semi-fixed and dry fixed dune \ngrasslands) and wet dune habitats (dune slacks and damp dune grassland) based on the \nvegetation assemblages recorded when the soil samples were taken. Quadrat data were \nclassified according to the UK National Vegetation Classification (Rodwell 2000) using the \nMATCH programme (Malloch 1998). Dry and wet habitats were separated because the rates \nof soil development differ strongly between dry and wet habitats due to the influence of the \nwater table on winter flooding duration and water availability in summer.  \n \nThe organic matter accumulation data produce sigmoid curves which go through three main \nphases: a slow increase in %LOI, followed by a period of rapid increase, then a levelling off \n 6\nof %LOI to a much slower rate of increase. A similar pattern is observed in both dry and wet \ndune habitats, although with different characteristics.  \nIn the dry habitats (Figure 1a), the initial phase consists of a slow increase in %LOI from a \nstarting point of around 0.2 % in the bare sand of mobile dunes to around 1 % occurring more \nor less when vegetation cover reaches 100 %. Analysis of all data points, including those later \nbecoming fully fixed, shows that the average time taken to become fully vegetated is 22.3 \u00b1 \n15.2 years in these dry dune habitats (intervals ranged from 4 to 56.5 years). The second, \nsteeper phase commences roughly when full vegetation cover is established and the organic \nlayer exceeds 1 cm thickness (data not shown). The %LOI increases rapidly and by 60 years \nafter the onset of vegetation establishment some soils have reached organic matter contents \ncomparable to the much older soils. In the third phase, the OSL dates and the estimated \nminimum ages of the older fixed grassland soils suggest that %LOI then appears to level out, \nwith values of around 3 \u2013 4 % in the oldest dune soils at this site, with a maximum organic \nlayer thickness of 6 cm (data not shown \u2013 two outlier samples reach 8.5 cm due to smearing \nof the soil profile by slow sand accumulation, however %LOI values for these samples are \nnot outliers).  \n \nThe curve for the wet habitats (Figure 1b) shows the same overall pattern but the rate of \nincrease is steeper and reaches higher organic matter contents. Here the initial phase is almost \nabsent and dune slacks take on average only 11.3 \u00b1 7.8 years to become fully vegetated, \naround half the time taken in the dry dune soils. Some soils under 60 years old reach values \nof 4 \u2013 5 %LOI and, as with the dry dune habitats, there is considerable scatter around the \nsteeper part of the curve. Our knowledge of the shape of the curve beyond an age of 60 years \nis constrained by the availability of historical records with which to accurately date soil \nlocations, and in particular the older dune slacks within the Warren. However, the data from \nthe OSL-dated damp grasslands at this site suggest that a similar plateau exists in wet dune \nsoils, this time at higher LOI values of 5 \u2013 7 %, although this level may be higher still since \nwet dune slacks generally have a higher organic matter content than damp grassland. The \nmaximum organic layer thickness was 9 cm (data not shown). \nThese soil development curves were compared with other data available from the literature. \nFor dry dune habitats (Figure 2), it is apparent that the curve is both steeper and reaches a \nhigher %LOI before levelling off in comparison with other published data. In the wet dune \nhabitats (Figure 3), to aid comparison with published studies, the data for Newborough were \nconverted to organic matter pools using bulk density data from the original studies. In \ncontrast to the dry dune habitats, the resulting soil development curve reaches a lower organic \nmatter content and is less steep than data reported for Terschelling in the Netherlands. \n \nClimate variables and nitrogen deposition \nAnalysis of some of the general and location-specific factors affecting rates of organic matter \naccumulation was undertaken by regression of accumulation rates against climate and \nlocation-specific environmental variables for soils under 60 years old for which soil age was \nreliably estimated; soil ages ranged from 11 to 57.5 years. The trends in the main climate \nvariables at Newborough are presented briefly to provide context for the analysis. Average \ntemperature (Figure 4a), and maximum and  minimum temperatures (not shown) showed \nsimilar trends over time, with an increasing temperature trend particularly over the last 20 \nyears; all were included in the analysis in case biological responses were linked to \ntemperature thresholds such as growing season temperatures. The number of frost days (not \nshown) was also included in the analysis and showed marked differences in pattern when \nbroken down to 3-month seasons. The profile for reconstructed nitrogen deposition at \nNewborough (Figure 4a) showed a continuous increase over time to a peak in the 1990s \n 7\nwhich is more-or-less maintained subsequently. Rainfall (Figure 4a), shows considerable \ninter-annual variation but is highest in the period 1940 - 1970. However, when broken down \nto 3-month seasons (Figure 4b), clear seasonal differences in the rainfall pattern emerge. \nPeaks and troughs in rainfall occur over time periods of 2 \u2013 10 years, but are not consistent \nby season. For example, a peak in summer rainfall in the late 1950s is offset from peaks in \nautumn and winter rainfall by around 3 years, while spring rainfall records a trough over the \nsame period. Long-term trends suggest declining summer and winter rainfall, contrasted with \nincreasing spring and autumn rainfall. The number of gale days (Figure 4c) shows generally \nlow values until the early 1960s when they increase rapidly over a five-year period and then \nsteadily decline again. As with rainfall, the number of gale days show distinct differences \nwhen broken down by 3-month season. Talbot\u2019s Mobility Index and average windspeed (not \nshown) show broadly similar trends to that of winter gale days, but with stronger declines in \nthe 1960s and 1990s. Figure 5 shows the inter-relationships between the climate and N \ndeposition variables in a principal components analysis. Nitrogen deposition is strongly \nassociated with all the temperature variables which form a cluster high on axis 1, while frost \ndays form a looser cluster low on axis 1. Rainfall and gales by season show the greatest \nvariability and exhibit relatively little clustering. Figure 6 shows the relationship between soil \nage and the %LOI accumulation rate, and indicates high variability in %LOI accumulation \nper year. \n \nTable 1 shows the results of the regression of individual variables against the %LOI \naccumulation rate. In the dry dune habitats, temperature variables explain a high proportion \nof the variance, with R2 ranging from 26.0 % up to 48.8 %. Surprisingly, the relationship is \npositive with greater %LOI yr-1 at higher temperatures. Average, maximum and minimum \ntemperatures all behave similarly, with results from both 6-month and 3-month seasons \nsuggesting that winter temperatures are less important than the other seasons. The number of \nfrost days also explains a high proportion of the variation (R2 up to 43.9 %). Consistent with \nthe temperature results, frosts are less important in winter than in other seasons and the \nnegative relationship shows that %LOI yr-1 is higher with fewer frost days. Total annual \nrainfall has relatively low explanatory power, although there is a significant negative \nrelationship with 6-month summer rainfall, suggesting %LOI yr-1 is positively influenced by \ndrier summers. Similarly there is a weakly significant negative relationship with the number \nof gales in 6-month summer. Neither wind speed nor Talbot\u2019s Mobility Index appear to \ninfluence the rate of soil development. However, nitrogen deposition shows a strong positive \nrelationship, explaining 42.0 % of the variation. \n \nIn the wet dune habitats, a lower proportion of the variation is explained by any of the \nvariables than in the dry dune habitats. Temperature influences soil development to a much \nlesser extent than in the dry dunes, explaining at most 11.9 % of the variation. In contrast to \nthe dry dunes, winter temperatures show the strongest relationship with %LOI yr-1, with 3-\nmonth winter temperatures having the greatest influence. Again the relationship is positive, \nshowing greater %LOI yr-1 at higher average winter temperatures. The negative relationship \nwith frost days confirms this pattern, with 3-month winter frosts explaining 14.4 % of the \nvariation. Rainfall explains very little of the variation. However, the number of gale days \nshow some significant negative relationships, with 3-month spring and autumn seasons being \nmost important. Neither windspeed, Talbot\u2019s Mobility Index nor nitrogen deposition explain \na significant proportion of the variation in %LOI yr-1 in wet dune habitats. \n \n \n \n 8\nLocation-specific environmental variables \nOf the location-specific variables in the dry dune habitats soil pH explains up to 28.8 % of the \nvariation in %LOI yr-1 but this is not significant due to the lower number of samples with \nassociated pH information. Neither distance to the sea nor slope steepness significantly \nexplain any of the variation. In the wet dune habitats, neither pH nor distance to the sea \nexplain much variation. All dune slack samples were taken on flat ground, so slope could not \nbe analysed as an explanatory variable for the wet dune habitats. \n \nIn addition to the multivariate analysis, multiple regression analysis was used to determine \nthe degree of co-correlation between variables. In the dry dunes, temperature showed the \nstrongest positive relationship with %LOI yr-1, but when other significant variables were \nadded there was little additional explanatory power (only average temperature was used since \nmaximum and minimum temperatures were assumed to be highly co-correlated with average \ntemperature). It made little difference whether the 6-month seasonal variables were used or \nthe highest explanatory (usually 3-month) seasonal variable in each climate variable set. \nAlthough strongly significant on its own, N deposition appears to be highly co-correlated \nwith temperature. Environmental variables that were partially orthogonal to temperature and \nwhich helped explain additional variation in the dry habitats included number of gale days \nand summer rainfall, with temperature (AveTemp_Aut3) and gale days (Gales_Sum6) \ntogether explaining well over half the variation (R2 of 62 %). In the wet habitats, although \nthere was a high degree of co-correlation of both average temperature and frost days with the \nnumber of gale days, when combined in a multiple regression these three variables \n(AveTemp_Win3, Gales_Spr3 and Frost_Win3) explained 23.4 % of the variation. \n \nWhile the location-specific environmental variables ought not to be co-correlated with \nclimate variables they added only a little explanatory power. The proportion of the variation \nexplained increased to 68.4 % in the dry dunes when slope was added as a variable. In the \nwet dune habitats the variation explained increased to 27.5 % when distance to the sea was \ncombined with the above three climate variables.  \n \nNitrogen and carbon accumulation rates \nNitrogen accumulation rates (Figure 7) show considerable variation in this dataset, ranging \nfrom 16 - 67 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Average values (\u00b1 s.d.) are lower in the dry dunes (37.6 \u00b1 13.1 kg \nN ha-1 yr-1) than the wet dune habitats (45.8 \u00b1 15.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Figure 7 suggests a \nnegative trend of N accumulation rate with soil age, but the trend is not significant (R2 = 5.5 \n%, p = 0.231 for dry and wet habitats combined). Carbon accumulation rates are 582 \u00b1 262 \nkg C ha-1 yr-1 in the dry dunes and 730 \u00b1 221 kg C ha-1 yr-1 in the wet dune habitats. \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThis paper presents a detailed chronology over the first 140 years of soil development in sand \ndune habitats at Newborough Warren. Soil development, taken as organic matter \naccumulation, is non-linear and shows strong correlations with climate variables, in particular \ntemperature and the number of gales, while location-specific variables appear to have less \ninfluence.   \n \nThis study has, for the first time, produced a highly detailed chronology of the first 60 years \nof soil development in dry and in wet dune habitats, extending with a lower temporal \n 9\nresolution to 140 years. The data suggest that soil development is strongly non-linear and \nfollows a sigmoid curve. Data from the literature for dry dune habitats suggest either a linear \nor increasing rate over a period of 200 years or so (Gerlach et al. 1994; Salisbury 1922; 1925; \nWilson 1960), but lack the high resolution at this early part of the curve. In wet dune habitats, \na sigmoid curve appears to be the norm (Berendse et al. 1998; Ernst et al. 1996; Lammerts et \nal. 1999). However, the greater resolution provided in this study suggests that a sigmoid \ncurve applies to both habitat types. The initial slow start reflects the time taken for full \nvegetation cover to establish, when litter fall and root carbon inputs are sufficient to \ncommence the build-up of organic matter. Although it may seem obvious that soil \ndevelopment progresses faster under full vegetation cover, it has strong implications for the \nmanagement of dune systems, as it suggests that soil development can be retarded if the semi-\nfixed areas can be maintained in an open state. At the upper end of the curve, the reasons for \nthe slow down in rates of soil development are less obvious. Soil chronosequences over much \nlonger time periods show a continuously decreasing rate of organic matter accumulation, \nuntil equilibrium with climate conditions is achieved. This can take up to 10,000 years (Syers \net al. 1970). However, a very rapid change in accumulation rate is shown in the first 100 \nyears of this chronosequence. This is not an artefact of the sampling methodology as the \norganic layer thickness did not exceed the 15 cm sampling depth in any sample. The rate of \norganic matter accumulation in dune soils reflects the balance between supply of organic \nmaterial and its decomposition. Historically in the UK, the hind dune grasslands have been \nused as marginal grazing, but are also heavily grazed by rabbits (Boorman 1989). Thus the \nslow down in organic matter accumulation observed at around 60 years may reflect a \ndecrease in the supply of organic matter due to off-take by grazers (Ritchie et al. 1998). There \nmay also be changes in decomposition rate, since skeletal soils such as these lack a true soil \nprofile and the full range of decomposer guilds may not be functionally present. \nDecomposition in very young sand dune soils is primarily by microbial and fungal \ndecomposers rather than macrofauna (McLachlan and van der Merwe 1991), and microbial \ncommunity composition varies with age in other early successional systems (Nemergut et al. \n2007). Therefore, the observed slow down in soil development may also correspond to an \nincrease in the rate of decomposition as a fully functioning decomposer community \nestablishes. More work is required to explore these ideas in detail. \n \nWhat is particularly surprising about the curves for dry habitats is how much steeper and \nhigher they are in comparison to other published data. While vegetation type plays a role in \nsoil development through effects on productivity and litter biochemistry (Berendse 1998), \nand higher values of %LOI are reported for dunes of similar age under shrubs or forest \n(Gerlach et al. 1994; Salisbury 1925; Wilson 1960) this study specifically compared data \nfrom dune grasslands, and the Newborough data show much more rapid soil development \nthan other studies. Climate and soil type also play a role. In temperate latitudes, soil \ndevelopment is usually faster under wetter conditions, while low soil pH leads to faster soil \ndevelopment (Wilson 1960). However, soil development rates in this study exceed both the \nacidic comparison sites (Blakeney \u2013 average rainfall 580 mm, and Studland \u2013 average rainfall \n750 mm) and the site at Southport with a similar climate and sand mineralogy to \nNewborough (Ranwell 1959; Salisbury 1925)\u2013 average rainfall at both sites is 850 mm. One \nkey difference is that most of the published data were reported in the 1920s. Therefore, the \nearly successional soils will have been formed under different climate conditions and a \ndifferent nitrogen deposition regime, a factor which has been alluded to by Berendse (1998) \nbut not examined in detail until this study. It is also possible that the data describe 2 separate \ncurves, and that the rapid increase in soil development will lead to a plateau higher than that \nobserved for 140 year old soils whose initial formation occurred under different climate and \n 10\nnitrogen deposition regimes, although there is no way to test this hypothesis. Lastly, \nconditions specific to Newborough such as partial afforestation or management history may \nhave contributed to the rapid soil development. However, a chronosequence for Merthyr \nMawr, a non-afforested site in South Wales 200 km away, showed very similar rates of soil \ndevelopment over the same period (Jones et al. 2007). Therefore, it seems likely that factors \noperating over spatial scales of at least hundreds of kilometres, rather than site-specific \nconditions, have affected the rate of soil development.  \n \nA contrasting situation occurs in the wet dune habitats where organic matter accumulation is \nslower than in the published literature. However, these are not like-with-like comparisons. \nThe studies from one dune area at  Terschelling (Berendse et al. 1998; Lammerts et al. 1999) \nchart soil development after episodes of turf-stripping. This typically leaves a substrate \ncontaining residual organic matter, which at these Dutch sites is also partially de-calcified \nand speeds up subsequent soil development (Berendse et al. 1998). This contrasts with the \ndevelopment of embryonic dune slack vegetation on calcareous sand at Newborough and may \nexplain the relatively faster soil development compared with Newborough.  \n \nThe results suggest that large scale processes such as climate or pollution history have \ncontributed to the rapid soil development observed here. This is backed up by the results of \nregression analysis in this study. Climate variables in the dry dunes explain up to 62 % of the \nvariation in rates of soil development in combination. While these relationships are only \nstatistical associations and may not be causal, nonetheless consistent patterns emerge, with \nfaster soil development in the dry dunes associated with warmer temperatures and with drier \nsummers, and negatively associated with summer storms. The positive link with autumn \ntemperature and negative link with spring frosts suggest that a longer growing season may be \none mechanism allowing a greater supply of organic matter to the system. Interestingly, it \nappears that drier summers promote soil development, perhaps implying that summer \ndroughts do not inhibit plant productivity at this west coast UK site. Temperature should also \nincrease rates of organic matter decomposition (McLachlan and van der Merwe 1991); but \nthe net increase in soil development rates suggests that soil development in the dry dunes in \nthis phase is controlled by plant productivity rather than organic matter decomposition. In the \ndune slacks temperature appears to play less of a role than in the dry dunes. Dune slack soil \ncharacteristics have been linked to hydrological regimes (Grootjans et al. 1998) and it is \nsurprising that rainfall shows no significant associations with soil development in these wet \nhabitats, given the controls that the water table has on rates of organic matter decomposition. \n \nThere is also a strong link of soil development with nitrogen deposition in the dry dunes. \nNitrogen deposition at Newborough has increased by around 75 % since 1920, and this may \npartly explain the faster rates of soil development at Newborough compared with older \nstudies. Experimental work at Newborough (Plassmann 2006) and in the Netherlands (ten \nHarkel et al. 1998) has shown that a proportion of excess nitrogen is retained in the system, \nand this would be expected to increase soil organic matter accumulation directly by \npromoting plant productivity. Phosphorus limitation is prevalent in calcareous dunes in The \nNetherlands where it limits the response of plant productivity to excess nitrogen (Kooijman \nand Besse 2002; Kooijman et al. 1998),, in which case nitrogen should play a lesser role in \nsoil development. However, vegetation N:P ratios suggest that phosphorus limitation is not \nprominent at Newborough (Jones et al. 2004), while Plassmann (2006) suggests that  \nphosphorus limitation in the older dune grasslands at Newborough may occur with a doubling \nof current levels of atmospheric nitrogen input. Therefore, nitrogen remains the main limiting \nnutrient at this site. However, nitrogen deposition and temperature are highly co-correlated, \n 11\nand it is not possible to separate their effects on soil development in this study. Rising \natmospheric CO2 concentrations increase N and C accumulation rates (Luo et al. 2006) and \nthis may be another cause of faster soil development, but will also be co-correlated with \naverage temperature and nitrogen deposition.  \n \nSand dunes are dynamic systems and disturbance is a key factor which acts to hinder soil \ndevelopment. Average windspeed, Talbot\u2019s Mobility Index (Talbot 1984), and factors such as \nsand movement and salt spray, linked to distance to the sea all represent some form of \ndisturbance and will impede soil development. However, summer gales was the only variable \nlinked to disturbance which significantly explained any variation. The negative link with \nsummer gales in the dry dunes suggests that it is extreme events such as storms rather than \naverage climate conditions which cause the most disturbance. Ranwell (1958) reported \nmaximum sand movement at Newborough occurring over the summer and autumn months, \nwith one gale in May causing more sand movement than 3 preceding months of moderate \nweather. \n \nOther location-specific variables like soil pH show surprisingly little effect on soil \ndevelopment. However, even the oldest dry dune soils at Newborough are not or hardly de-\ncalcified, while in the dune slacks the lowest pH (water) is 5.8, so gradients in soil pH are \nfairly small. Slope angle also appears to have little effect on soil development, although \nmicro-climate and rainfall infiltration are influenced by slope steepness. Frederiksen et al. \n(2006) explained variation in vegetation communities by comparison with distance from the \nsea and a suite of micro-climate and topographical indices. They found a strong effect of \ndistance from sea, linked to successional age, on both vegetation communities and some soil \nparameters but, as in this study, found relatively little influence of micro-climate or \ntopographical factors on vegetation and soils. \n \nIn this study, a high proportion of the variation in rates of soil development is explained in \nthe dry dunes, up to 68.4 %, but a lower proportion of the variation (27.5 %) in the wet dune \nhabitats. The relatively small sample size for the regression analysis of dry dune habitats \nshould be noted, which increases the chance of artefacts in the results. Of the unexplained \nvariation, part must be attributable to errors in ageing soil locations and to natural variability \nin soil development. However, variation may also be due to factors such as disturbance which \nthis study has only indirectly been able to address, or factors causing local heterogeneity in \nsoil development such as grazers (Salisbury 1952), and variations in vegetation type \n(Berendse 1998). These factors operating over longer periods of time, together with \nstochastic factors such as disturbance may help explain the variability in %LOI in the oldest \ndated soils. In the dune slacks where the environmental variables explained a much lower \nproportion of the variation, it is possible that other factors such as groundwater chemistry and \nhydrological regimes (Grootjans et al. 1998) play a role, as these can show considerable \nspatial variation even within a site (Jones et al. 2006; Stuyfzand 1993). \n \nIt is evident from the N accumulation rates of 16 \u2013 67 kg N ha-1 yr-1 that, over the steepest \nparts of the curve, N accumulation greatly exceeds retention of atmospheric nitrogen \ndeposition. Given atmospheric inputs of up to 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and a conservative assumption \nof 30 % retention of atmospheric N inputs based on leaching studies (Jones et al. 2005; ten \nHarkel et al. 1998), this would give retention of between 2 and 3.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 of \natmospherically derived nitrogen over the period of soil development. Therefore, atmospheric \nN deposition can only be one source of N entering the system and biological fixation is likely \nto also be a major source of N during this phase of soil development. N fixation may be via \n 12\nlegumes, cyanobacteria or other N-fixing species such as the shrub Hippophae rhamnoides.  \nThree stands of H. rhamnoides, approximately 10 m across had established at Newborough \nfrom seed, but were cleared in the 1990s. Soil sampling avoided any areas close to shrubs and \ncleared areas, therefore these stands are unlikely to influence the data. Survey data show that \nlegumes reach a maximum 11 % cover at Newborough (Jones et al. 2002), and legumes could \nbe a minor source of fixed N. However, cyanobacteria in sand are likely to be the major \nsource of N fixation (Kumler 1997) and were estimated to fix 25 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in dune \ngrassland at an East coast UK site, Blakeney Point (Stewart 1967). Such facilitation by \nnitrogen-fixers is an established part of ecological succession theory (Crocker and Major \n1955). A conservative estimate of total biological fixation in this system must at least be \nequivalent to 10 \u2013 60 kg N ha-1 yr-1, assuming that other loss pathways of N such as \ndenitrification are minimal. These data represent only the N pool in the soil which is typically \n80 % of the total ecosystem N pool including N in above and below ground vegetation in \nestablished UK dune grasslands (Jones et al. 2002; Jones et al. 2005), therefore soil nitrogen \naccumulation rates at Newborough are slightly higher than total ecosystem N accumulation \nrates of 40 \u2013 46 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in a 76-year chronosequence at Terschelling (Berendse et al. \n1998) and higher than rates reported for heathland and an inland dune chronosequence in the \nNetherlands (Berendse 1998). Indeed, these rates are higher than any reported for comparable \nsystems, although the soils here are very young and Knops and Tilman (2000) suggest that N \naccumulation rates decline with increasing N pools, which is supported by older dune \nchronosequences with average rates of ca. 4 kg N ha-1 yr-1 over 1000 years (Olson 1958b; \nSyers et al. 1970) and 1 kg N ha-1yr-1 over 10,000 years (Syers et al. 1970).   \n \nIn summary, the detailed chronology for the first 140 years of dune soil development \npresented in this study shows a strongly non-linear pattern, with rates far exceeding those for \nother dry dunes in the literature. Regression analysis suggests that there are strong \nassociations with factors operating on a broad-scale such as climate and nitrogen deposition, \nand that location-specific factors operating on a smaller scale are less important at this \ncalcareous site where soils have not yet decalcified. Therefore, recent climate and\/or nitrogen \ndeposition regimes may have accelerated soil development compared with past rates. \nNitrogen accumulation rates are high, and the data suggest that N inputs from biological \nfixation are roughly four times greater than from atmospheric deposition. The period of most \nrapid soil development commences more or less when full vegetation cover is established, \nand this has implications for site management, with particular importance attached to \nmaintaining the open status of semi-fixed habitats in order to protect the obligate dune \nspecies which depend on them.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was commissioned by the Countryside Council for Wales as part of its programme \nof research into sustaining natural beauty, wildlife and outdoor enjoyment in rural Wales and \nits inshore waters, and was co-funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council. \n \n 13\nReferences \nBailey S D 2004 A geophysical and geochronological assessment of coastal dune evolution at \nAberffraw, North Wales.
