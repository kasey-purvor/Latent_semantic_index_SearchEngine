We investigate its effect on HIV prevention, using prospective data from a general population cohort in eastern Zimbabwe spanning a period of extensive behavior change (1998-2003). Almost half of the initially uninfected women interviewed were members of at least one community group. In an analysis of 88 communities, individuals with higher levels of community group participation had lower incidence of new HIV infections and more of them had adopted safer behaviors, although these effects were largely accounted for by differences in socio-demographic composition.

We investigate its effect on HIV prevention, using prospective data from a general population cohort in eastern Zimbabwe spanning a period of extensive behavior change (1998-2003). Almost half of the initially uninfected women interviewed were members of at least one community group. In an analysis of 88 communities, individuals with higher levels of community group participation had lower incidence of new HIV infections and more of them had adopted safer behaviors, although these effects were largely accounted for by differences in socio-demographic composition. Individual women in community groups had lower HIV incidence and more extensive behavior change, even after controlling for confounding factors.

However, participation in community groups is not always beneficial \nto health, and several limitations have been noted (veenstra 2000; Ziersch \nand Baum 2004).\nin the Hiv\/aidS field, social capital has been found to have protective \neffects on a number of factors associated with risk of infection, including \nother sexually transmitted infections (Holtgrave and Crosby 2003), sexual \nbehavior (Crosby et al. 2003), condom use (albarracin et al. 2004), use of \nalcohol (Campbell, williams, and Gilgen 2002), and intimate-partner violence \n(Pronyk et al. 2008b). Social capital has also been found to mediate people\u2019s \naccess to aidS-related health services and antiretroviral treatment (Binag-\nwaho and Ratnayake 2009; ware et al. 2009), and to influence the extent to \nwhich people perpetuate or internalize stigma associated with aidS (Chiu \net al. 2008).\na few studies have directly explored the influence of social capital on \nHiv acquisition (Campbell, williams, and Gilgen 2002; Gregson et al. 2004b; \nPronyk et al. 2008b). while these studies have found potentially protective \neffects of community group membership, their cross-sectional designs and \nfocus on associations with prevalent (current) rather than incident (new) \nHiv infection status leave open the possibility that these findings may not be \ncausal but, for example, may result from selective participation in community \ngroups by \u201chealth-conscious\u201d individuals (dutta-Bergman 2004). a further \nlimitation of the literature on the relationship between community group \nmembership and Hiv infection is that, while social capital is often regarded \nas being a property of communities, studies have focused exclusively on the \nrelationship at the individual level.\nin this article, we investigate the effect of community group member-\nship on Hiv incidence among women and men at both the population level \nand the individual level. we use prospective data from a population-based \ncohort study in communities in eastern Zimbabwe that have been subject \nto one of the largest generalized aidS epidemics in sub-Saharan africa. we \ndescribe recent patterns of group membership within these communities and \nfind that membership levels tend to be higher among women than among \nmen and have fluctuated somewhat over a period of political and socioeco-\nnomic instability. we show that communities with greater social capital tend \nto have lower levels of Hiv incidence and less risky behavior patterns among \nwomen, although this is explained, to some extent, by these communities\u2019 \nolder age structures and less developed and more remote locations. at the \nindividual level, we find that women who have participated in a wide range \nof different community groups have lower Hiv incidence rates and are more \nlikely to have adopted protective sexual behavior than women with no prior \nparticipation in these groups. men who participated in community groups \nalso reported adopting safer behavior, but this did not result in lower Hiv \nS i m o n  G R e G S o n  e t  a l .  335\nincidence. we explore whether group membership could have facilitated the \nsuccessful adoption of protective behaviors through knowledge diffusion or \nby increasing self-efficacy in these communities, and we identify some of the \ncharacteristics of groups that may influence their social capital value in sup-\nporting the adoption of low-risk behaviors. \nCommunity groups and reduced vulnerability \nto HIV infection: Theoretical perspectives\nSocial capital research varyingly emphasizes its \u201cnetwork\u201d dimension (high \nlevels of participation in local community groups) (Foley and edwards 1999) \nand its \u201cnorm\u201d dimension (particularly levels of trust among community \nmembers) (Binagwaho and Ratnayake 2009). Putnam (2000) argues that the \nnetwork concept of associational membership is a more powerful marker of \nsocial capital than the norm dimensions of trust and reciprocity. Furthermore, \nin our original research in Zimbabwe (Gregson et al. 2004b), we found no \nrelationship between measures of trust and reciprocal help and support, the \ntwo norm measures most frequently used in social capital research. against \nthis background, we define social capital in terms of people\u2019s participation \nin local community groups (Campbell, williams, and Gilgen 2002; Gregson \net al. 2004b).\nCommunity groups are seen as facilitating psychosocial determinants \nof healthy behaviors, first, because they provide networks for the diffusion \nof health-related information (knowledge diffusion) and, second, because \nthe solidarity that arises from membership in a positively valued social group \nleads to higher levels of confidence in one\u2019s ability to take control of one\u2019s \nhealth (health-related agency or perceived self-efficacy\u2014Bandura 1977; \nwallerstein 1992). \nnevertheless, the influence of social capital on health is varied, and \nstudies have sometimes yielded apparently conflicting results. Social capital \nhas been found to have both negative and positive effects on health (Portes \nand landolt 1996), and the social capital value of a given community group \nmay lie on a continuum that ranges from the positive to the negative (astone \net al. 1999). Previously, we have suggested that this might be because the \nsocial capital value of community groups varies in the effect it has on health \noutcomes according to individual member and group characteristics (Gregson \net al. 2004b). \nat the individual level, the effect of group membership varies by sex \n(norris and inglehart 2006; Pronyk et al. 2008b), ethnicity (nhamo, Camp-\nbell, and Gregson 2010), and educational attainment (Gregson et al. 2004b). \nat the level of community groups, it is believed that intra-group, inter-group, \nand beyond-group characteristics all can be important. Community groups \ncan offer \u201csocial spaces\u201d for informal discussion in which respected and trusted \n336  S o c i a l  c a p i ta l  a n d  H iV  i n f e c t i o n  i n  R u R a l  Z i m b a b w e\npeers are able to \u201ctranslate\u201d unfamiliar biomedical information into locally ap-\npropriate language and terminology that makes sense to group members, and \nto debate any reservations members might have about the value of the knowl-\nedge (renegotiation of peer norms). Such discussion provides opportunities \nfor peer group members to formulate health-enhancing action plans that are \nrealistic in light of locally mediated social, economic, and cultural constraints \non behavior. Community groups may be more likely to effect improvements \nin health and health care when they create contexts for the development of \ncomradeship and solidarity that boosts members\u2019 confidence, social skills, \nand perceived self-efficacy (Putnam 2000; Saegart, thompson, and warren \n2001; Campbell and macPhail 2002; wouters, meulemans, and van Rensburg \n2009). at the same time, groups with diversity in their membership could \nincrease the likelihood of program success by putting members in touch \nwith more powerful social groups that can provide support and assistance \n(Campbell and mzaidume 2001; Skovdal et al. 2010). other intra-group char-\nacteristics that could be influential in determining the social capital value of a \nparticular community group include whether the group functions effectively, \nthe frequency and timing of meetings, whether the group has a horizontal or \na hierarchical structure (Collier 1998), whether meetings are cooperative or \nconflictual, the formality of meeting structures, whether meeting agendas are \nopen or narrowly focused, meeting settings, alcohol consumption at meetings, \nand whether the group has external sponsorship (Gregson et al. 2004b). inter- \nand beyond-group ties through overlapping memberships, interactions with \nsimilar and different groups (Putnam 1993; woolcock 2001), and provision \nof assistance for non-members also may be important. \nThe Manicaland study: Data and methods\nour study was carried out in manicaland, Zimbabwe\u2019s eastern province, be-\ntween 1998 and 2005. this was a period of considerable political and socio-\neconomic instability in Zimbabwe, with the emergence of the movement for \ndemocratic Change opposition party in 1999, the defeat of a proposed new \nconstitution in a national referendum in 2000, closely fought parliamentary \n(2000 and 2005) and presidential (2002) elections, and a turbulent land \nredistribution program (starting in 2000). in the wake of these and other \ndevelopments (e.g., Zimbabwe\u2019s involvement in the war in the democratic \nRepublic of the Congo in 1998 and the imposition of targeted sanctions in \n2002), the economy experienced a rapid decline in the early 2000s, with aver-\nage real earnings dropping by more than 80 percent between 2001 and 2004 \n(international monetary Fund 2008). extensive internal and international \nmigration also occurred throughout this period. \nthe manicaland study was conducted in 12 locations comprising two \nsmall towns, two tea and coffee estates, two forestry plantations, two roadside \ntrading settlements, and four subsistence farming areas. most of the locations \nS i m o n  G R e G S o n  e t  a l .  337\nwere not directly affected by the land redistribution process, which was fo-\ncused on privately owned commercial farms. However, the economic decline \nhad a major impact through reductions in earnings and erosion of savings, \nwhile the highly charged political environment influenced the extent of social \ninteractions and modified their nature.\nwe use prospective data from the manicaland study to measure and \nevaluate statistical associations between community group membership and \nrisk of acquiring Hiv infection at the population and individual levels. the \ndetailed procedures followed in the study have been published previously \n(Gregson et al. 2006). in brief, a baseline enumeration of all households in \neach location was carried out in one site at a time between July 1998 and \nFebruary 2000. a random sample of women aged 15\u201344 years and men \naged 17\u201354 resident within these households was recruited into a longitu-\ndinal general-population open-cohort survey, interviewed on such topics as \nsocio-demographic characteristics, membership in community groups, and \nsexual behavior, and tested for Hiv infection. First and second follow-up \nenumerations and surveys were conducted three years (July 2001\u2013February \n2003) and five years (July 2003\u2013august 2005) after the baseline survey in \neach location. all respondents at baseline and individuals who had previ-\nously been too young to participate but who now met the age criteria were \nconsidered eligible at each round of follow-up.\nFollowing these procedures, 80 percent of eligible women and 78 per-\ncent of eligible men participated at baseline, 77 percent and 80 percent partici-\npated at first follow-up, and 87 percent and 79 percent participated at second \nfollow-up. Sixty-six percent of women and 54 percent of men interviewed at \nbaseline and not known to have died in the interim were re-interviewed at \nfirst follow-up. the equivalent figures between the first and second follow-\nup surveys were 66 percent and 58 percent. out-migration was the principal \nreason for loss to follow-up.\nHere we use data primarily from the first two rounds of the manicaland \nstudy since these span the period (1998\u20132003) of widespread reductions in \nrates of sexual partner acquisition and the beginnings of an extended decline \nin Hiv prevalence in Zimbabwe (Gregson et al. 2010; Zimbabwe ministry \nof Health and Child welfare 2010). in an earlier analysis of cross-sectional \ndata for young women, we found that membership in community groups \nself-reported as functioning well was protective against Hiv infection, while \nmembership in groups reported as functioning poorly was associated with \nincreased risk of infection (Gregson et al. 2004b). therefore, we treated \nstudy participants as being members of community groups if they reported \nmembership in at least one group that they regarded as functioning effec-\ntively. Community groups identified specifically as \u201cchurch groups\u201c were \nnot included since membership is very high (72 percent of women and 48 \npercent of men at baseline), and their social capital value in supporting safer \nsexual behaviors would have been difficult to distinguish from the effects of \n338  S o c i a l  c a p i ta l  a n d  H iV  i n f e c t i o n  i n  R u R a l  Z i m b a b w e\nreligious teaching. we examined the effects of community group member-\nship on two main outcome indicators\u2014incident Hiv infection and adoption \nof safer behavior during the three-year inter-survey period\u2014and (in the \nindividual-level analysis) on two possible intermediate variables\u2014increased \nknowledge about Hiv\/aidS and increased self-efficacy measured over the \nsame period. Respondents were considered to have adopted safer behavior \nif they reported having been sexually active at baseline and reported fewer \nnew sexual partners or no new partners in the last year at follow-up. data \non sexual behavior were collected using the informal Confidential voting \ninterview method to reduce under-reporting of socially proscribed behaviors \n(Gregson et al. 2004a). in each round of the survey, knowledge about Hiv\/\naidS was measured using an index constructed from responses to questions \nabout modes of transmission, protective measures, and symptoms (Gregson \net al. 1998). the median index scores for knowledge at baseline were 59 \npercent for women and 61 percent for men. Self-efficacy was measured us-\ning responses to the question: \u201cdo you think there are things you can do to \navoid becoming infected with Hiv?\u201d the extent to which community groups \nprovided social spaces for discussion of Hiv\/aidS was measured at follow-\nup only, using responses to a question on whether the group in which the \nparticipant spent most time discussed Hiv prevention as part of their formal \nagenda and\/or in informal discussions.\nFor the population-level analysis of the effects of community group \nmembership, the original 12 study locations were subdivided into clusters \nbased on villages (in rural areas and roadside settlements), residential com-\npounds (estates), and suburbs (small towns). where a cluster had fewer than \nten individuals who qualified for a particular analysis (i.e., on the basis of sex, \nage, and being uninfected at baseline), it was excluded from that analysis. \nin measuring the individual-level effects of community group membership \nover the inter-survey period, we compared outcomes, among previously un-\ninfected women and men, between those who were members of community \ngroups at baseline and those who were not. thus, individuals who ceased to \nbe members of groups during the study period were included, while those \nwho joined groups during this period were excluded.\nPopulation-level effects of  \ncommunity group membership\nSocial capital is conceived of most commonly as a property of communities. \ntherefore its effects should, wherever possible, be investigated at the popula-\ntion level. Before exploring the association between group membership and \nHiv risk in the manicaland study, we briefly describe the levels of commu-\nnity group membership over time across the different socioeconomic strata \nrepresented in these data. \nS i m o n  G R e G S o n  e t  a l .  339\nTrends in community group membership\nGroup membership fluctuated during Zimbabwe\u2019s recent history (Figure 1), \ndropping from 43 percent (women) and 28 percent (men) in the late 1990s to \n33 percent and 21 percent, respectively, in the early 2000s before recovering \nto 37 percent and 23 percent in the mid-2000s. underlying these trends was \nconsiderable turnover of group membership. one-third (34 percent) of the \nwomen who had reported membership in a group they regarded as function-\ning well in the first round of the survey had ceased to be a member of any \ngroup three years later at round two, and a further 5 percent reported that \nthe group or groups they belonged to previously were no longer functioning \nwell. the equivalent percentages for men were even higher\u201461 percent and \n11 percent. \nin the late 1990s, the most popular groups for women were burial so-\ncieties (community insurance schemes for funeral expenses) (22 percent), \nrotating credit societies (savings clubs for income-generating projects) (18 \npercent), and women\u2019s groups (sewing and other income-generating activi-\nties) (10 percent). Sports clubs (12 percent) were the most popular type of \ngroup for men. Contrasting increases or decreases in membership levels were \nseen for different types of groups between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s, \nprobably reflecting the effects of high aidS mortality and rapidly rising infla-\ntion. Burial societies (women: from 22 percent to 21 percent; men: 6 percent \nto 8 percent), aidS groups (women: 2 percent to 5 percent; men: 1 percent \nto 2 percent), and political groups (women: 3 percent to 7 percent; men: 2 \npercent to 7 percent) experienced stable or consistently rising membership \nover time, while rotating credit societies (women: 18 percent to 10 percent; \nmen: 10 percent to 4 percent) and women\u2019s groups (10 percent to 6 percent) \nsaw reductions in participation.\nPopulation-level analysis\nin our study sites in Zimbabwe, 88 out of 222 clusters had ten or more unin-\nfected women at baseline. Figure 2 shows that those clusters with greater pro-\nportions of women reporting membership in community groups at baseline \nhad fewer new Hiv infections over the following three years (ordinary least \nsquares regression coefficient \u2013.090, p<.001). this effect was reduced after \nadjustment for differences in the proportions of younger and older women in \nthe clusters (coeff. \u2013.060, p=.03) and reduced further after additional adjust-\nment for socioeconomic strata (town, estate, roadside, and village) and level \nof education (coeff. \u2013.051, p=.1).

However, membership in community groups led to only modest im-\nprovements in knowledge about Hiv\/aidS during the follow-up period. thirty-\nfive percent of the women who reported membership in community groups \nat baseline had improved their score on the knowledge index by 5 percent or \nmore during the inter-survey period, compared with 31 percent of the women \nwho had not previously been members of community groups. the difference \nwas statistically significant only for members of burial societies (Figure 6a). in \ncontrast, a larger increase in the proportion of women who believed they could \ntake steps to avoid becoming infected with Hiv (self-efficacy) occurred between \n1998 and 2003 among women who were members of community groups than \namong women who were not (26 percent versus 15 percent). this trend was \nobserved in all types of groups except youth clubs (Figure 6B).\nSimilar proportions of men who were and were not participating in com-\nmunity groups at baseline (37 percent in each case) improved their score on \nthe knowledge index by 5 percent or more during the inter-survey period. \nthere were no signs in the data of variations by type of group. most men \nbelieved there were things they could do to avoid becoming infected with \nHiv, and the proportion increased over time from 93 percent to 97 percent; \nhowever, no difference was found between the increases in men who were \nmembers of community groups and those who were not. \nCharacteristics of community groups that may \nhelp their members reduce HIV risk\nin the second round of the manicaland study (2001\u201303), we collected data \non group characteristics suggested in the literature (Gregson et al. 2004b) \nas potentially enhancing the effect of community groups in assisting their \nmembers to avoid Hiv infection (table 2). we found that for men and women \ncombined community groups generally met on a regular basis (53 percent \nof members reported meeting weekly and a further 40 percent said they \nmet monthly). two-thirds of the respondents (65 percent) reported discuss-\ning Hiv\/aidS during their meetings either as part of the formal agenda or \ninformally, and there was evidence that this was the case not only in aidS \ngroups but in groups as diverse as sports clubs and farmers\u2019 groups (Figure \n7). in most cases, meetings were said to be cooperative (90 percent) rather \nthan conflictual (10 percent).\nthere was considerable heterogeneity in the membership of individual \ngroups.

But \nfewer women were in a group that discussed aidS, a group with young peo-\nple, a group with a high proportion of better-educated people, a group with \nexternal sponsorship, a group where members drank alcohol, or a group that \nassisted or met with other groups. Some of these differences reflect underly-\ning differences in the types of groups in which men and women participated. \nthe burial societies and rotating credit societies favored by women rarely \nreceived external support or assisted other groups, while the sports clubs \nand youth clubs preferred by men generally had younger members and were \noften sponsored by schools or employers. once contrasts between the types \nof groups that women and men joined were taken into account, the only dif-\nferences that remained were in aidS discussions and alcohol consumption. \nwhen analysis is restricted to discussions held as part of the formal agenda, \nwomen were more likely than men to report discussing aidS during group \nmeetings (42 percent versus 32 percent). this difference was explained by \nwomen\u2019s greater propensity to join groups that hold formal discussions about \naidS (e.g., women\u2019s groups, youth clubs, and aidS groups).\nDiscussion\nas has been the case in Zimbabwe as a whole (Gregson et al. 2010), Hiv preva-\nlence in adults has been falling in our study populations in eastern Zimbabwe \nsince the late 1990s\u2014from 23 percent to 18 percent over the period 1998 to \n2005 (Gregson et al. 2007). this fall in Hiv prevalence appears to have followed \nan acceleration in the rate of decline of new infections between 1999 and 2004 \n(Hallett et al. 2009), driven in part by reductions in rates of sexual partner \nacquisition (Gregson et al. 2006). these changes in behavior are believed to \nhave resulted from social changes prompted by increased awareness of aidS \ndeaths aided by Hiv prevention programs using both mass media and church-\nbased, workplace-based, and other interpersonal communication activities \n(Halperin et al. 2011). our findings suggest that these social changes also may \nhave been facilitated by high levels of social capital in the form of female civic \nengagement. almost half of the previously uninfected women in our sample \nwere members of community groups at recruitment; a higher proportion of \nthese women than of their peers who were not members of groups reported \nadopting lower rates of sexual partner acquisition during the following three \nyears, and fewer became infected with Hiv. Similar effects were also seen at \nthe population level of analysis, although the associations were reduced after \nadjustment for differences in age, location, and education.\nParticipation in community groups appears to have helped women to \nadopt safer behaviors and to avoid Hiv infection primarily through increased \nself-efficacy\u2014an individual-level characteristic that is protective against Hiv \ninfection in this population (Gregson et al. 2011). among women who had \n352  S o c i a l  c a p i ta l  a n d  H iV  i n f e c t i o n  i n  R u R a l  Z i m b a b w e\npreviously said they did not know how to avoid becoming infected with Hiv, \nthose who were members of community groups were much more likely at \nfollow-up to report feeling able to protect themselves from infection. \nStudies on the effects of social capital on health have sometimes ap-\npeared to yield conflicting results. much of this complexity may lie in differ-\nences in how the concept is defined and measured. Pronyk and colleagues \nnoted recently that \u201cdespite over a decade\u2019s experience, there is no universally \naccepted way to measure social capital\u201c (Pronyk et al. 2008b). in their own \nstudy of poor households in rural limpopo province in South africa, com-\nmunity group membership was associated with greater risk of Hiv infection \nin women (ibid.). However, the apparent discrepancy between their finding \nand the results for women in our study may be explained by differences in \nthe way group membership was measured (intensity of membership versus \nquality of group functioning; household-level versus individual-level report-\ning), differences in the biological specimens used to detect the presence of \nHiv infection (oral-mucosal transudate versus dried blood spot specimens), \nand differences in the variables controlled for in the statistical analyses (prior \nhistory of high-risk sexual behavior was not controlled for in the South africa \nstudy), as well as by differences in some of the factors noted in the following \ntwo paragraphs.\ndifferences in study methods notwithstanding, it seems clear that so-\ncial capital varies in the effect it has on health outcomes in different settings \n(Portes and landolt 1996). we have suggested that this may reflect differ-\nences in local context, local patterns of group membership, and group and \nindividual member characteristics (Gregson et al. 2004b). the contrasting \neffects on Hiv incidence in women and men found in the current study may \nreflect sex differences in some of these factors.\nthe groups in which women in our study communities participated \nappear to have had a number of positive features. almost all groups met at \nleast once a month, and Hiv prevention was discussed both formally and \ninformally by a wide variety of groups, indicating that community groups \nprovide numerous social spaces for dialogue about Hiv prevention. meetings \nwere reported overwhelmingly as being cooperative, and the involvement \nof, for example, more and less educated individuals within the same groups, \ntogether with extensive interaction with other groups and the wider com-\nmunity, testifies to high levels of bridging social capital.\nin contrast to these findings for women, we found little evidence that \nmembership in community groups had helped men take steps to avoid Hiv \ninfection. we found greater reductions in reported sexual risk behavior \namong male group participants, but these did not lead to lower incidence \nof new Hiv infections. Furthermore, group membership was not associated \nwith larger increases in knowledge or self-efficacy in men. a number of fac-\ntors may help to explain the different findings for women and men. these \ninclude the greater and longer-term participation of women in community \nS i m o n  G R e G S o n  e t  a l .  353\ngroups, the pre-existing high levels of self-efficacy seen among men, and the \ndifferences in the types and characteristics of the groups joined by women \nand men. men are generally less likely to join groups where aidS is discussed \n(lyttleton 2004; Skovdal et al. in press), and this was true in the current study \nfor formal discussions about aidS. men who participated in community \ngroups in manicaland were more likely to join groups such as sports clubs and \npolitical parties, which exhibit competitiveness and power rather than care \nand sustaining of household livelihoods. this tendency is linked intrinsically \nto gender-based and local constructions of masculinity (Barker and Ricardo \n2005). For example, in South africa, Ragnarsson and colleagues (Ragnars-\nson et al. 2009) found that the kind of community groups and networks with \nwhich men are typically affiliated promote behavior that actively encourages \nmultiple sexual partners and related high-risk behaviors. this, coupled with \nmen\u2019s greater propensity to belong to groups that drink alcohol during or \nafter meetings, suggests that men often join community groups as a way to \ndevelop and demonstrate their masculine identities\u2014often at the expense of \ntheir health. acknowledging social constructions of masculinity as a barrier \nto health and well-being, researchers are increasing their efforts to document \nthe pathways through which men can create social spaces to renegotiate and \ndevelop more health-promoting concepts of masculinity (Barker and Ricardo \n2005; Colvin and Robins 2009; Burke et al. 2010).\none of the main contributions of this study is its use of an actual health \noutcome (Hiv incidence) rather than purely self-rated outcomes. on the other \nhand, a limitation is the study\u2019s reliance on self-reported data on group mem-\nbership and characteristics (including whether or not the group functioned \neffectively). the self-reports on sexual behavior were collected using a confi-\ndential method that has been shown to reduce bias in study populations, and \nthe reports are credible since the results largely match those for Hiv incidence \n(lopman et al. 2008). Participation in community groups in manicaland is \nselective. differences in individual characteristics between group members \nand non-members at baseline were controlled for in the main analyses, and \ntypes of groups with different patterns of membership showed similar trends \nin reducing Hiv incidence. However, we were not able to capture unobserv-\nable characteristics of respondents in the study, so selective participation may \nhave had some residual effect on the findings. the evidence for population-\nlevel associations between levels of group membership and Hiv risk in women \nwas weak, possibly because it is more difficult to establish evidence of impact \nof group membership when communities are loosely defined and groups are \nnot specific to particular communities as was the case in this study. we ex-\ncluded community groups identified specifically as \u201cchurch groups\u201c from the \nanalysis; if the effect of women\u2019s participation in these groups (over and above \nany effect of religious teaching) is similar to that observed for other types of \ngroups, then the overall contribution of community group membership to \nreductions in Hiv incidence could be even greater. \n354  S o c i a l  c a p i ta l  a n d  H iV  i n f e c t i o n  i n  R u R a l  Z i m b a b w e\nthe effect of community group membership appears to have been \nparticularly important during the period up to 2003. whereas women who \nparticipated in these groups were at lower risk of having contracted Hiv in-\nfection prior to baseline (1998\u20132000) (Gregson et al. 2004b) and experienced \nfewer new infections over the period 1998\u20132003, no effect on Hiv incidence \nwas observed in the following two years\u2014that is, between the second and \nthird rounds of our survey (data not shown). overall, there were fewer new \ninfections during this period, and group members, having already adopted \nless risky behaviors, had less scope for further reductions.\nBecause of the potential for social capital to mitigate Hiv risk, some \nefforts have been made to explore whether social capital can be generated \nintentionally. Recent experiences from group-based microfinance projects in \nSouth africa (Pronyk et al. 2008a; Pronyk et al. 2008c) and Kenya ( Skovdal \net al. 2010) suggest that social capital can be generated and strengthened \nexogenously. Furthermore, we noted that many of the groups in manicaland \nreceived assistance from nongovernmental organizations and other external \nsources of support. the evidence we identified for reductions in new cases of \nHiv infection among women who participated in community groups strongly \nsuggests that support for women\u2019s community groups could be an effective \nHiv prevention strategy in countries with large-scale Hiv epidemics. \nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n A\n1 \nIm\np\nac\nt \no\nf \nso\nci\nal\n g\nro\nu\np\n m\nem\nb\ner\nsh\nip\na  \no\nn\n r\nis\nk\n o\nf \nac\nq\nu\nir\nin\ng \nH\nIV\n
