First the Human Genome Program and\nthen the Decade of the Brain have not merely offered vastly\ngreater knowledge of aspects of human biology, but they\nhave also held out the promise of further technological\npower to manipulate both genes and minds in the interests\nof individual health and greater social tranquility.\nTechniques of intervention barely imaginable a decade\nago, at best the stuff of science fiction, now rate stock mar-\nket quotations and turn academic researchers into entre-\npreneurial millionaires. To judge from headlines in daily\nnewspapers, or the titles of academic papers in major sci-\nentific journals, the issues of a decade ago have been set-\ntled. Vulgar sociobiology may be out, but what I have called\n\u201cneurogenetic determinism\u201d is strongly entrenched. There\nare genes available to account for every aspect of our lives,\nfrom personal success to existential despair: genes for\nhealth and illness, genes for criminality, violence, and \u201cab-\nnormal\u201d sexual orientation \u2013 even for \u201ccompulsive shop-\nping.\u201d And genes too to explain, as ever, the social inequal-\nities that divide our lives along lines of class, gender, race,\nethnicity; and where there are genes, genetic and pharma-\ncological engineering hold hopes for salvation that social\nengineering and politics have abandoned.\nThe challenge to the opponents of biological determin-\nism is that while we may have been effective in our critique\nof its reductionist claims, we have not offered a coherent\nalternative framework within which to interpret living pro-\ncesses. We may reply that we have been too busy attempt-\ning to rebut the determinists, but sooner or later it becomes\nnecessary to spell out more coherently our contrasting bi-\nological case. Lifelines (Rose 1997) originated as an at-\ntempt to meet that challenge, first, to try to convey what it\nmeans to \u201cthink like a biologist\u201d about the nature of living\nprocesses, second, to analyse both the strengths and limi-\ntations of the reductionist tradition which dominates much\nof biology, and, third, to offer a perspective on biology\nwhich transcends genetic reductionism, by placing the or-\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22, 871\u2013921\nPrinted in the United States of America\n\u00a9 1999 Cambridge University Press 0140-525X\/99 $12.50 871\nPr\u00e9cis of Lifelines: Biology, \nfreedom, determinism1\nSteven Rose\nBiology Department, Brain and Behaviour Research Group, Open University,\nMilton Keynes, MK7 6AA, United Kingdom.\ns.p.r.rose@open.ac.uk\nAbstract: There are many ways of describing and explaining the properties of living systems; causal, functional, and reductive accounts\nare necessary but no one account has primacy. The history of biology as a discipline has given excessive authority to reductionism, which\ncollapses higher level accounts, such as social or behavioural ones, into molecular ones. Such reductionism becomes crudely ideological\nwhen applied to the human condition, with its claims for genes \u201cfor\u201d everything from sexual orientation to compulsive shopping. The\ncurrent enthusiasm for genetics and ultra-Darwinist accounts, with their selfish-gene metaphors for living processes, misunderstand both\nthe phenomena of development and the interactive role that DNA and the fluid genome play in the cellular orchestra. DNA is not a\nblueprint, and the four dimensions of life (three of space, one of time) cannot be read off from its one-dimensional strand. Both devel-\nopmental and evolutionary processes are more than merely instructive or selective; the organism constructs itself, a process known as\nautopoiesis, through a lifeline trajectory. Because organisms are thermodynamically open systems, living processes are homeodynamic,\nnot homeostatic. The self-organising membrane-bound and energy-utilising metabolic web of the cell must have evolved prior to so-\ncalled naked replicators. Evolution is constrained by physics, chemistry, and structure; not all change is powered by natural selection,\nand not all phenotypes are adaptive. Finally, therefore, living processes are radically indeterminate; like all other living organisms, but\nto an even greater degree, we make our own future, though in circumstances not of our own choosing.\nKeywords: autopoiesis; developmental trajectories; evolutionary theory; homeodynamics; human behavior; metabolic webs; neuro-\ngenetics; reductionism; self-organisation; ultra-Darwinism\nsteven rose is Director of the Brain and Behavior Re-\nsearch Group and Founding Professor of Biology at The\nOpen University.

To stress my pos-\nitive case, it has also in places been necessary to set it\nagainst the counter-case made at its rhetorical strongest. To\ndo so, I have had to choose appropriate foils. The two au-\nthors who have most clearly served me in this way are the\nsociobiologist Richard Dawkins, whose several books speak\nwith a single ultra-Darwinist voice, and the philosopher\nDaniel Dennett, whose Darwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea (Den-\nnett 1995) carries ultra-Darwinism to the furthest reaches\nof excess.\nBecause Lifelines is written for a general audience, sev-\neral sections, notably those on genetics and development,\ninclude a substantial amount of explanatory material which\nwill be familiar to most readers of this journal, and I have\ntherefore omitted them from this pr\u00e9cis, or abbreviated\nthem to summary statements of the examples employed.\nChapter 1: Biology, freedom, determinism\nThe power of western science derived from its capacity to\nexplain and later to control aspects of the non-living world\nstudied by physics and chemistry. Only subsequently were\nthe methods and theories shaped by the success of these\nolder sciences turned towards the study of living processes\nthemselves. The past successes of science have been based\nnot so much on observation and contemplation but on ac-\ntive intervention into the phenomena they wish to explain.\nBiologists are now beginning to lay claims to universal\nknowledge, of what life is, how it emerged, and how it\nworks. Throughout all life forms and all living processes,\ncertain general principles hold; certain mechanisms, cer-\ntain forms of chemistry, exist in common. But intervention\ninto living processes confronts us with moral dilemmas, be-\ncause biology impinges directly on how we live. Its tech-\nnologies transform our personal, social, and natural envi-\nronments and make claims as to who we are, about the\nforces that shape the deepest aspects of our personalities,\nand even about our purposes here on earth.\nThe science we do, the theories we prefer, the technolo-\ngies we use and create as part of that science, can never be\ndivorced from the social context in which they are created,\nfrom the purposes of those who fund the science, the world\nviews within which we seek and find appropriate answers,\nto the great what, why, and how questions that frame our\nunderstanding of life\u2019s purposes. So with modern biology,\nwhose diverse answers to these questions are imbued with\nsocial and political significance. The dominant fashion for\ngiving genetic explanations to account for many if not all as-\npects of the human social condition \u2013 from the social in-\nequalities of race, gender, and class to individual propensi-\nties such as sexual orientation, the use of drugs or alcohol,\nor the failures of the homeless or psychologically distressed\nto survive effectively in modern society \u2013 is the ideology of\nbiological determinism. I offer an alternative vision of liv-\ning systems which recognises the power and role of genes\nwithout subscribing to genetic determinism, which recap-\ntures an understanding of living organisms and their trajec-\ntories through time and space as lying at the centre of biol-\nogy. It is these trajectories that I call \u201clifelines.\u201d\n1.1. Themes: Biological questions. There is commonly\nsupposed to be a hierarchy of sciences, ranging from\nphysics through chemistry, biology, and the human sci-\nences. In this convention, physics is seen as the most fun-\ndamental of the sciences to which the others must aspire,\nor be reduced. But biological science raise themes which\ncannot be reduced to physics. To show why, consider a frog\njumping into a pool. The cause of the jump may be de-\nscribed as the contraction of the leg muscles, preceded by\nnerve impulses, and so on. Or one could explain the jump\nin terms of intention \u2013 to escape a predator \u2013 or in terms of\nontogeny, or of phylogeny \u2013 or in terms of the actin and\nmyosin fibres of which the muscle is composed. All are nec-\nessary and valid parts of description; only the last is reduc-\ntionist. Which explanation one finds satisfying depends on\nthe purposes for which it is intended.\n1.2. Themes: Time. The concept of time and the direction\nof \u201ctime\u2019s arrow\u201d are central to biology. Living processes\nare complex, often irreproducible because historically con-\ntingent, and hence also practically irreversible. Dobzhan-\nsky (1973) asserted that \u201cnothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in the light of evolution.\u201d I claim that nothing in bi-\nology makes sense except in the light of history \u2013 the his-\ntory of life in general, of individual development, and of\nour own science and its concerns. The past is the key to the\npresent.\n1.3. Themes: Space. The second deep theme with which\nbiologists are concerned is that of structure. To the three di-\nmensions of space must be added the dimension of time.\nOrganisms have forms which change but also persist\nthroughout their life\u2019s trajectory, despite the fact that every\nmolecule in their body has been replaced thousands of\ntimes over. How is form achieved and maintained? Cells,\norganisms, are more than simple lists of chemicals. Neither\ntheir three-dimensional structures nor their lifelines can\nsimply be read off from the one-dimensional strand of\nDNA. Today the task of a biology of structure has become\none of understanding how to reassemble these compo-\nnents, to explain both form and its transformation and per-\nsistence through time.\n1.4. Themes: Dynamics. Homeostasis is a dominating mo-\ntif of biological thought. But the metaphor of homeostasis\nconstrains our view of living systems. Lifelines are not\npurely homeostatic, they have a beginning at conception,\nand an end at death. Organisms, and indeed ecosystems,\ndevelop, mature, and age. The set points of homeostatic\ntheory are not themselves constant during this trajectory\nbut change over time. To put the organism and its lifeline\nback at the core of biology means replacing the static, re-\nductive, DNA-centred view of living systems that currently\npervades biological thinking by an emphasis on dynamics,\nprocess, the relationships between object and fields, and\nthe paradox of development by which any organism must\nsimultaneously be and become.\n1.5. Themes: Autopoiesis. These processes of develop-\nment transcend the crude dichotomies of nature and nur-\nture, gene and environment, determinism and freedom. \nInstead we must speak of the dialectic of specificity and\nplasticity during development through which the living or-\nganism constructs itself. The central property of all life is\nautopoiesis, the capacity and necessity to build, maintain,\nand preserve itself.\nRose: Lifelines\n872 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nChapter 2: Observing and intervening\nScience begins with observation, but no one observes neu-\ntrally. We construct our world. Observation demands sam-\npling and categorising events and processes, distinguishing\nobject from field. Most sciences are also interventive, re-\nquiring that experimental conditions be constrained and\nmanipulated \u2013 and hence reduced (e.g., my own work on\nmemory in chicks, Rose 1992).\nThis example also points to another feature of science,\nthe use of resemblance (chick memory as equivalent to hu-\nman memory). Metaphors occur when we liken some\nprocess or phenomenon observed in one domain to that in\na quite different one. Metaphors are not meant to imply\nidentity of process or function, but should serve to cast light\non the phenomenon one is studying. Analogy implies a sur-\nface resemblance between two phenomena, perhaps in\nterms of the function of a particular structure. By contrast,\nhomology implies a deeper identity, derived from an as-\nsumed common evolutionary origin. Thus, homology car-\nries with it an assumption of shared history and origins, and,\nby inference, it implies common mechanisms (e.g., fore-\nlimb hooves of a horse and the human hand; chick and hu-\nman memory).\nDoes memory consitute a Platonic natural kind? Are\nthere indeed \u201cnatural kinds\u201d in biology? Neither individu-\nals, nor species, nor complex biological molecules such as\nproteins can be so regarded. Each is defined operationally\nand has a unity given by process, not by composition.\nChapter 3: Knowing what we know\nThe purpose of observing and experimenting is to derive\nknowledge of the world and its workings, to enable us to\npredict and control it. This action imperative characterises\nmodern science. Bacon understood this when he described\nexperiments as being of two kinds, those that brought light\nand those that brought fruit. For Bacon, knowledge came\nthrough induction. Popper replaced induction with hy-\npothesis-making. Kuhn argued instead for paradigms,\nframeworks within which the problem-solving of normal\nscience was set. But where do paradigms come from? For\nKuhn the question was an individualistic, almost psycho-\nlogical one. However, following both the older Marxist tra-\ndition and the newer insights of the sociologists of science,\nKuhn\u2019s question allows the social into science. We frame\nour questions of the world in ways which are constrained\nboth by the material reality of that world and by the para-\ndigm blinkers: our social expectations and the history of\nhow our science chooses to ask its questions. Here the\npower of metaphor in biology \u2013 often derived from tech-\nnological or social artefacts \u2013 becomes important (e.g., ATP\nas a currency system, DNA as a code, brains as computers;\nsocial organisms as conforming to monetarist cost-benefit\neconomics). Favoured paradigms and hypotheses are rarely\nsimply disconfirmed (e.g., an experiment of mine done\njointly with Sheldrake to test so-called morphic resonance).\nNor does the fact that a technology \u201cworks\u201d mean that the\nframework in which it is based is true (e.g., claims that chil-\ndren who misbehave at school suffer from attention deficit\ndisorder and can be treated with the drug ritalin; ritalin may\nindeed make a child more tractable, but that does not con-\nfirm the original diagnosis).\nA further constraint on science is the available technol-\nogy. The questions that we ask of the living processes we\nstudy are not merely not answerable without the technol-\nogy, they are unthinkable. Before the development of light\nmicroscopes in the seventeenth century, the existence of\nbacteria and other single-celled organisms was wholly un-\nsuspected. So was the \u201cunit\u201d of life, the cell, until the mi-\ncroscopists of the mid-nineteenth century. Until the advent\nof the electron microscope in the early 1950s, the internal\nconstituents of cells were unobservable and hence un-\nknown. It was impossible either to build theories about the\npartition of cellular functions which such subcellular parti-\ncles might embody.\nTechnology solves certain problems and suggests others.\nBut it also constrains the way we view the world. Example:\nelectron microscopy (EM). To prepare living tissues for EM\nit is necessary to fix, embed, stain, and section. The ap-\nprentice electron microscopist is taught how and what to\nsee, what to regard as \u201creal\u201d and what as \u201cartefact\u201d \u2013 the un-\nwanted consequences of one or more of the procedures\nwhich the living tissue has been put through. Thus, the new\nobserver is initiated into the conventional wisdom devel-\noped by forty years of work in the artificial world of elec-\ntron microscopy. This fixed pattern of the electron micro-\ngraph forms the basis for drawing of cells in biology\ntextbooks and provides the convention within which even\nexperienced biologists mainly think of them. So powerful is\nthe technology that it becomes hard to move beyond it, to\nthink in three, let alone four dimensions (e.g., x-ray diffrac-\ntion patterns; gel separation of proteins).\nThese are the sciences made possible by technology, the\ntechnologies made possible by science. The world view we\ncreate is derived from the intimate interaction of technol-\nogy and science with the eye of craft experience, shaped by\nthe theoretical expectations within which we as biological\nresearchers must live. It is a world which presents chal-\nlenges which go deeper than Popperian hypothesis-making,\nKuhnian paradigms, and truth versus performance with\nwhich those studying the epistemology of science attempt\nto make their own sense of what we do. Wresting reliable\nknowledge from the world we biologists study is, as\nKoestler described it, an Act of Creation.\nSo what justification can there be for claiming that it is\npossible to obtain reliable knowledge of the living world?\nThe evolutionary lineage which led to humans has been\ncharacterised by the development of more flexible organ-\nisms with bigger and more powerful brains, able to adapt to\nrespond to rapidly changing circumstances. To survive and\nsucceed, our evolutionary forebears had to rely on their\nbrains to make reliable hypotheses about the world around\nand to act appropriately upon them. If the mental world\nwhich we construct in this way did not correspond reason-\nably accurately to the way the world outside \u201creally\u201d is, we\ncould not survive. Such hypothesis-making may be seen as\nthe starting point for science. But science is socially organ-\nised hypothesis-making. Hypotheses must be shared,\ntested, and agreed on amongst a community. Nothing that\noccurs in the non-human animal world matches the cumu-\nlative nature of hypothesis-making which constitutes hu-\nman science. We are able to build on the tested and seem-\ningly validated hypotheses not merely of those who are\ncurrently alive but those of all previous generations.\nHumans, however, are more than just scientific hypoth-\nesis makers. We live in communities shaped by many other\ncultural and economic forces that provide strong guidance\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 873\nas to how we should view the world around us and our fel-\nlow humans. In Britain in the 1990s, where the gap between\nrich and poor is greater than it has been for a generation,\nthe world is seen from very different perspectives by the di-\nrectors of the privatised utilities and by the people they\nhave sacked. In a society in which there is a strong division\nof labour and power between men and women in every field\nof work from science to child care, their viewpoints on the\nworld will also differ. A white racist football fan will be un-\nlikely to make the same hypotheses about the world as will\nthe black player he abuses.\nFor many fields of scientific hypothesis-making, these\nrather crudely drawn distinctions may be irrelevant, but bi-\nology claims to be in a position to tell us, as humans, who\nwe are, where we came from, where we are going, and how\nwe must live and relate to our fellow living creatures. The\nmetaphors and analogies we find attractive are laden with\ncultural values and expectations that come from outside our\nscience. Those who deny this are ignorant of the hard work\ndone by philosophers and sociologists in developing an un-\nderstanding of the nature of science and the knowledge it\ncreates.\nDespite this doubt at the very core of the scientific en-\ndeavour, we are not in a position to assert that \u201canything\ngoes.\u201d Although the observations we make about the world\nare theory- and ideology-laden before we start, and the\njoints into which we carve nature are provided less by a pri-\nori definitions than by operational need, they nonetheless\nmust make some more or less good fit with the world or we\ncould not proceed. Our hypotheses would fail. However\ngreat their budget, genetic engineers will not be able to turn\nhumans into angels, nor cryogenicists restore the memories\nof the past owner of a severed and frozen head.\nChapter 4:The triumph of reductionism?\nTo many scientists reductionism is first not second nature.\nAs an example, an exchange took place at a Royal Society\nMeeting in 1986 between Popper, who argued that bio-\nchemistry is irreducible to chemistry, and Perutz, who drew\non the role of haemoglobin to claim that it could be so re-\nduced. But knowledge of the molecular structure of\nhaemoglobin explains how it serves as an oxygen carrier,\nand cannot answer the biological question of what function\nsuch a capacity serves in a living organism.\n4.1. Reductionism as methodology. We find it easier to\nunderstand phenomena if we can hold them relatively iso-\nlated from the rest of the world and alter potential variables\nsingly, simplifying and enabling one to generate seemingly\nlinear chains of cause and effect (e.g., studying enzyme ki-\nnetics by altering either temperature or pH; altering both\nsimultaneously makes mathematisation almost impossible.)\nHence the attraction of reductionism and why it has served\nscience so well. But living systems are not simple. Variables\ninteract. Parameters are not fixed. Properties are non-\nlinear. And the living world is highly non-uniform. We fail\nif we are not careful to remember that what happens in the\ntest-tube may be the same as, the opposite of, or bear no re-\nlationship at all to what happens in the living cell, still less\nthe living organism in its environment. It all depends.\n4.2. Theory reduction. One of the aims of science is to sim-\nplify, to embrace a maximal description of the world within\nthe minimum possible number of laws and variables. The\nhistory of science contains a number of examples of what\nwere originally believed to be different phenomena, and\nwere only later discovered to be identical (e.g., the morn-\ning and evening stars, regarded as distinct in previous cos-\nmologies, now understood to be a single entity, the planet\nVenus; the sciences of heat and light were once regarded as\ndistinct; today both heat and light are seen as forms of elec-\ntromagnetic radiation).\nSome unifications have been immensely powerful, par-\nticularly at the interface between biochemistry and chem-\nistry. For example, Lavoisier\u2019s recognition that the body\u2019s\n\u201cburning\u201d of the sugar glucose to carbon dioxide and water,\nwith the concomitant production of utilisable energy, was\nin chemical terms the equivalent of oxidation. This under-\nstanding that living processes did not depend on some mys-\nterious life force but involved chemical reactions which fol-\nlowed the same rules as those of chemistry and could be\nstudied in isolation was one of the great reductionist tri-\numphs of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nMore than mere metaphor, homology, or analogy, it was an\nexact description. Yet there are dangers inherent in such\ntheory reduction, which led to a philosophy of mechanical\nmaterialism amongst physiologists.\nModern textbooks offer the reduction of \u201cgene\u201d to\n\u201cDNA\u201d as a case parallel to that of the identity of the morn-\ning and evening stars. But \u201cgene\u201d and \u201cDNA\u201d are not ( just)\ntwo names for the same object. And it is at this point that\ntheory reduction tips over into its problematic, philosophi-\ncal form which claims that ultimately chemical theory is re-\nducible to a special case of physics, biochemistry to chem-\nistry, physiology to biochemistry, psychology to physiology,\nand ultimately sociology to psychology and hence to physics\n(e.g., E.O. Wilson\u2019s [1975] claim that neurobiology will can-\nnibalise sociology).\nTo see the implications of this type of reductionism, con-\nsider biochemistry and physiology. Although the two sci-\nences may speak different languages, use different instru-\nments, and read different journals, the phenomena they are\nstudying are the same, but at different levels \u2013 also an am-\nbiguous term. But what would the elimination of physiol-\nogy for biochemistry imply? Are we trying to describe a\ncausal relationship \u2013 that biochemistry (say, of a muscle\ntwitch) is causally responsible for the physiological event?\nIf so, this is a very different use of the word \u201ccause\u201d from\nthe way in which we normally use it to describe the rela-\ntionship in time between cause and effect \u2013 one event nec-\nessarily and specifically following from another. But the\nsliding of the actin and myosin filaments (the biochemist\u2019s\ndescription) does not precede the muscle contraction; it is\nthe muscle contraction, or at least part of it. That is, the re-\nlationship between the events described in the two lan-\nguages is one of identity, not cause \u2013 but a non-reductive\nidentity. There are features of the muscle twitch, such as\nfunction, which physiology describes but biochemistry can-\nnot. To put it formally, ontological unity permits epistemo-\nlogical diversity. The key feature which distinguishes a\nlower \u201clevel\u201d from those above it is that at each level new\ninteractions and relationships appear between the compo-\nnent parts, relationships which cannot be inferred simply\nby taking the system to pieces.\nFurthermore, philosophical reductionism implies that\nwhatever higher order properties emerge, they are some-\nhow secondary to the lower order ones. Parts come before\nRose: Lifelines\n874 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nwholes. Yet the nature of evolutionary and developmental\nprocesses in biology means that there is no such necessary\nprimacy. Wholes, emerging, may in themselves constrain or\ndemand the appearance of parts. To understand the world\u2019s\nontological unity we need the epistemological diversity that\nthe different levels of explanation offer.\nChapter 5: Genes and organisms\nThe trajectory of any organism through time and space \u2013 its\npersonal lifeline \u2013 is unique. Although each individual re-\nsembles all others of the same species, and resembles more\nclosely still its parents and siblings, no two are identical.\nWhat confers such similarities, such identities and differ-\nences, on the space-time trajectories of life? These ques-\ntions are the objects of study of genetics and developmen-\ntal biology, which began by asking rather similar questions\nabout the nature of life but at a key point in their history be-\ncame damagingly separated one from the other. This has re-\nsulted in conceptual confusions which have persisted well\ninto the present day. But to appreciate the consequences of\nthese confusions we have to go back into the history of ge-\nnetic and developmental thinking. Biology\u2019s own history is\ncentrally engaged within these current disputes.\nThe genesis of genetics lay with Mendel, who not only\nshowed that certain characters were transmitted indepen-\ndently but introduced quantitative measures, observing\nthat they appeared in successive generations in simple and\nreproducible ratios. Inheritance was discrete; each surface\nproperty was represented by an unobservable particle or\nstore of information, on the basis of which the colour and\nshape of the succeeding generations was determined\n(hence, e.g., 3\/1 ratios). Mendel was lucky. By contrast, the\ncharacters that interested Galton \u2013 human features such as\nheight, strength of handgrip, head circumference, or intel-\nligence \u2013 varied continuously across a broad range and off-\nspring tended to occupy middle territory between their par-\nents. Such continuously varying characteristics seemed to\nblend. Indeed Mendel\u2019s ratios turn out to be very special\ncases, even though, following their rediscovery in 1900,\nthey formed the cornerstone of genetics. The individual\nhidden determinants of surface characters became genes,\nand the total of an individual\u2019s genes formed its genotype\n(nowadays genome). The surface characters themselves\ncomprised the individual\u2019s phenotype. It is important to\nrecognise that none of these terms were very precisely de-\nfined, and practically from the beginning meant different\nthings to different researchers, varying from the specific\nfeatures of any individual of a species to some Platonically\nidealised \u201cspecies type\u201d to which all actually existing mem-\nbers of the species approximated. Genes were essences: the\nultimate, indivisible units on which the outward forms de-\npended; the unmoved movers, unchanged changers, within\neach organism.\n\u201cPhenotype\u201d is similarly ambiguous, and is used to refer\nto any or all observable or measurable features of an or-\nganism, from the presence of a particular enzyme to hair\ncolour or body feature or even a piece of characteristic be-\nhaviour such as gait whilst walking. Dawkins (1982) even\ngoes so far as to describe aspects of the external environ-\nment of an organism as part of its phenotype \u2013 for instance,\nhe sees the dam that a beaver constructs as part of that\nbeaver\u2019s phenotype. Yet the dam is not the product of the\nactivity of a single individual, but of the collective labours\nof many beavers. It also harbours a multitude of other\nspecies. If the dam is a phenotype, it is the phenotype of a\ncommunity, not of an individual, and its relationship to any\nindividual\u2019s genes, genotype, or genome is thus tenuous.\nThe distinction between discontinuous variation and\ncontinuous variation remained problematic through the\n1920s. Pearson developed many of the statistical methods\nstill in use today to analyse complex data. Indeed the histo-\nries of genetics and of statistics have been thoroughly in-\nterlocked ever since. The resolution of the conflict de-\npended on the recognition that continuous variation, in\nfeatures such as height, could be regarded as a consequence\nof the interaction of many genes of small effect. Diver-\ngences from simple Mendelian ratios steadily accumulated\n(e.g., sex-linked characters). Other divergences from the ra-\ntios are less straightforward and the models became more\ncomplex to account for them. However complicated and\nvaried the observed phenotypes, the modellers were still\ndetermined to explain them on the basis of the interaction\nof the indivisible causal particles which they conceived\ngenes to be. If the ratios did not work it was because some\nother factors were obscuring the proper functioning of the\ngenes (partial dominance; incomplete penetrance). Once\nthese possibilities are admitted, there is virtually no distri-\nbution of phenotypes found in the population to which a ge-\nnetic model cannot be fitted. In the traditional Popperian\nsense, such genetic models are strictly unfalsifiable. Given\nenough assumptions, any model can be \u201cfixed\u201d (e.g., schiz-\nophrenia).\nWhilst the Mendelian rediscoverers were busy defining\nthe phenotypic features they observed as the products of\nhypothesized genes, other biologists were looking at organ-\nisms from quite a different perspective. How does the\nunion of egg and sperm ultimately produce an organism\nwhich may consist of 1014 such cells, differentiated into tis-\nsues and organs, precisely located in space? Embryologists\ndescribed cell division, from fertilisation to the formation\nof the blastula and gastrulation, and identified a role for the\nchromosomes. This rhythm of cell division unrolling in a\nseamless sequence operates according to rules which the\nearly embryologists found hard to fathom. For some, the\nonly explanation was that the developing embryo was im-\nbued by an irreducible life force. To most, this conclusion\nwas unacceptable; they were observing a complex piece of\nliving clockwork. Whichever philosophy one adopted, the\ndividing ball of cells was splendidly accessible to experi-\nmental manipulation. What would happen, for instance, if\none removed a portion of the dividing cell ball, or cut \nit neatly in half? The results confused researchers for\ndecades, for the conclusion seemed to be \u201cit all depends.\u201d\nDepends on the organism, depends on how many divisions\nthe ball of cells has made prior to the cut; depends from\nwhere in the ball one removes the sample (e.g., contrast be-\ntween Roux, Driesch, and Loeb). Depending on the or-\nganism, at early stages in the cell division process, each cell\nstill retains all the determinants \u2013 genes \u2013 to make an en-\ntire offspring; at later stages some regions of the develop-\ning ball of cells retain this capacity and others do not; later\nstill the capacity is entirely lost, and the developmental fate\nof each region of the cell ball is fixed and cannot be modu-\nlated.\nTransplant studies revealed more. Sometimes a cell\u2019s fate\nis determined by the environment into which it has been\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 875\ntransplanted, in others it carries its own fate with it (e.g.,\ntransplant a group of cells from the region of a developing\ninsect destined to become a leg, and insert it into the head\nregion. Depending on the age of the embryo, the number\nof divisions it has undergone since fertilisation, the trans-\nplanted tissue may be incorporated into the developing\nhead or it may develop into an additional leg projecting\nanomolously from the head). During mitotic division each\ncell receives an identical set of determinants or genes and\nis totipotent. Later, although all the genes are still present\nin all the cells, which genes are expressed depends on the\ndevelopmental history of the particular cell. Thus gene ex-\npression depends on both time and space.\nThe major concern of developmental biology remained\nthat unrolling programme which led from a single fertilised\negg to the fully formed organism. How is it that what seem\nat first sight to be very similar cell masses, going through\nseemingly similar transformations, end up in the one case\nproducing a mouse and in the other a human? Why do the\ndaughters of a cell from one part of the dividing embryonic\ncell mass end up as liver and from another as brain or\nbones? How is it that all individual humans end up so as-\ntonishingly similar? Developmental biology is the science\nof the rules which produce regularities, similarities be-\ntween organisms. Genes are part of a harmonious dialectic\nof interaction with the environment by which fertilised cells\nbecome mature adults through a trajectory described as on-\ntogeny. And the constraints on this trajectory are only in\npart genetic.\nBy contrast, genetics was and is concerned with differ-\nences. Why is one Drosophila red eyed, the other white\neyed? Why do people differ in height? Why do some have\nblood cells which carry a haemoglobin molecule which\nseems unable to bind and carry oxygen as efficiently as is\nnormal? The question is to be answered in terms, ulti-\nmately, of the modern descendants of Mendelian determi-\nnants, the genes. Thus for genetics, genes came to be un-\nderstood as discrete units which lead in linear fashion to red\nversus white eyes or any other character of interest. On-\ntogeny is of interest only insofar as genetic differences may\nproduce abnormalities in development. Otherwise, the ge-\nneticists\u2019 organisms are empty of time and internal content;\nthere are only genes and phenotypes. They have no trajec-\ntory, no lifeline.\nUsing Drosophila, Morgan and his group showed that un-\nusual mutations were transmitted in a Mendelian manner\nand increased by X rays. Genes had a physical location in the\ncell, on chromosomes, and were thus distributed to daugh-\nter cells during mitosis, making possible the beginning of\ngene mapping. The term gene now had two different mean-\nings. On the one hand it was still an abstract entity, the de-\nterminant of a particular phenotypic character. On the other\nit had a clear location, a map reference, and could be shown\nto be physically transmitted between cells and their off-\nspring during both division and sex. The step which took ge-\nnetics beyond Morgan\u2019s location of genes to chromosomes\nalso brought it into conjunction with biochemistry for the\nfirst time. Mutations in Neurospora were even easier to in-\nduce and study than in fruit flies, but now the consequences\nwere metabolic. Mutants lack specific enzymes which play\na crucial role in the pathways which lead to missing metabo-\nlites. Each specific mutation leads to the absence of a spe-\ncific enzyme. Hence Beadle and Tatum\u2019s formulation: one\ngene equals, or produces, one enzyme.\nGenes were no longer to be understood only as hidden\nentities, metabolical accounting devices. They no longer\ndetermined characters, but instead, in a yet-to-be under-\nstood manner, were responsible for the production of en-\nzymes. So what is a gene \u201cfor\u201d a character? Consider eye\ncolour, which depends on the presence in the cells of par-\nticular pigments. In their absence, the eye is blue, increas-\ning quantities of the pigments provide colours which range\nfrom green to brown. Ignoring the developmental pro-\ncesses that lead to the formation of the eye, and within the\neye the iris, and the biochemical steps whereby the neces-\nsary precursors to the synthetic pathway are produced, the\ndirect pathway that leads to the synthesis of the eye pig-\nments involves many different enzymes. Hence to bio-\nchemists there is no longer any gene \u201cfor\u201d eye colour. In-\nstead there is a difference in the biochemical pathway that\nleads to brown and to blue eyes. A gene \u201cfor\u201d blue eyes\nmeans \u201cone or more genes in whose absence the metabolic\npathway which leads to pigmented eyes terminates at the\nblue eye stage.\u201d This rephrasing yet again exposes the dis-\ntinction between a developmental and a genetic approach.\nFor the developmental biologist, what is of interest is the\nroute which leads to pigmented eyes. But the geneticist is\nstill interested in the difference between brown and blue\neyes and retains the misleading shorthand of genes \u201cfor\u201d\nsuch colour differences. Dawkins, in The Extended Pheno-\ntype (1982), explicitly makes the same point, before going\non to discount it as irrelevant, provided the system behaves\nas if such \u201cgenes for\u201d existed. That is, his genes are purely\ntheoretical constructs, combinations of properties which\nmay or may not be embedded in specific enzymes or\nlengths of DNA, but which can be used to play mathemat-\nical modelling games. Sloppy terminology abets sloppy\nthinking. And it has implications for gene technology too.\nAs more is learned about the human genome, so early sim-\nplicities, such as the existence of a single gene responsible\n\u201cfor\u201d a particular disease, retreat. Many ostensibly \u201csingle\ngene disorders\u201d are now known to result from different\ngene mutations in different people. All may show a similar\nclinical picture but the gene mutation and hence enzyme\nmalfunction which results in the disorder may be very dif-\nferent in each case. This also means that drugs effective in\nameliorating the condition in one person may be simply in-\neffective in another.\nThe history of how genes became DNA, culminating in\nthe famous Nature papers of Crick, Watson, Franklin, and\nWilkins et al. in 1953 is too well known to need retelling.\nBut what made a length of DNA a gene? Genes were now\ncoded for polypeptides, and the 1960s saw the breaking of\nthis code and the formulation of Crick\u2019s Central Dogma:\nDNA r RNA r protein\nor, as Crick put it, \u201conce \u2018information\u2019 has passed into the\nprotein it cannot get out again.\u201d\nA formulation which is as central to ultra-Darwinian the-\nory as it is to molecular biology, DNA had become the mas-\nter-molecule, and the nucleus in which it was located had\nassumed its patriarchal role in relationship to the rest of the\ncell. It is hard to know which had more impact on the fu-\nture directions of biology, the determination of the role \nof DNA in protein synthesis, or the organising power of \nthe metaphor within which it was framed (e.g., Dawkins\u2019s\n[1986] description of willow seeds as floppy discs).\nPeriods of great unifying simplicity in science are fre-\nRose: Lifelines\n876 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nquently followed by times in which simplicity dissolves once\nmore into complexity. Not all DNA is coding; much is con-\ncerned with regulation (operons, etc.). And much more\nseems \u201cjunk\u201d or \u201cselfish\u201d \u2013 Crick\u2019s term. (Note that Crick\u2019s\nDNA\u2019s selfishness is demonstrated by the fact that it does\nnot do anything for the cell or the organism in which it is\nembedded; it simply allows itself to be copied. Dawkins\u2019s\nselfish genes on the other hand are so because they specif-\nically aid the successful reproduction of the organism which\ncontains them and hence their own replication.) Nor are\nthe coding sequences for any particular polypeptide aligned\nalong the DNA; they are separated by introns, and can be\nspliced, edited, read in different ways. The result is that far\nfrom being able to speak of one gene\/one protein, both\ngenes and proteins are disarticulated. Genes can be assem-\nbled from alternative pieces of DNA or rearranged so that\ntheir codes are read differently. And proteins take on mul-\ntiple forms as a result of cellular processes distal to DNA it-\nself. \u201cGenes\u201d are no longer coterminous with DNA-beads-\non-a-chromosome. Nor are even these segments stably\nlocated on the chromosome; as McClintock showed, genes\ncould jump. Hence the modern concept of the fluid\ngenome.\nFar from being isolated in the cell nucleus, magisterially\nissuing orders by which the rest of the cell is commanded,\ngenes, of which the phenotypic expression lies in lengths of\nDNA distributed along chromosomes, are in constant dy-\nnamic exchange with their cellular environment. The gene\nas a unit determinant of a character remains a convenient\nMendelian abstraction, suitable for armchair theorists and\ncomputer modellers with digital mindsets. The gene as an\nactive participant in the cellular orchestra in any individual\u2019s\nlifeline is a very different proposition.\nDNA is a stable molecule; what brings it to life is the cel-\nlular environment in which it is embedded. Genetic theo-\nrists have been misled by the metaphors that Crick pro-\nvided in describing DNA (and RNA) as \u201cself-replicating\u201d\nmolecules or replicators, as if they could do it all by them-\nselves. But they aren\u2019t and they can\u2019t. Replication isn\u2019t an\ninevitable chemical mechanism. Copying requires the pre-\ncursor molecules \u2013 which themselves must be synthesized\n\u2013 enzymes to unwind the two DNA strands, and others to\ninsert the new nucleotides in place and zip them up again.\nAnd the whole process requires energy. Further, the his-\ntones surrounding the relevant region or regions of the\ndouble helix must be unwrapped, the DNA strands sepa-\nrated, enzymes must transcribe the \u201csense\u201d strand into its\nmatched length of RNA, individual RNA lengths spliced,\nedited, and further manipulated in the cell nucleus, and if\nand only if so permitted, leave the nucleus to be inserted\ninto the copying machinery in the cell cytoplasm. Without\nthe complex biochemical environment the cell provides,\n\u201cgenes\u201d in the DNA sense of the term simply cannot func-\ntion.\nThis is why an individual\u2019s lifeline requires more than\nmerely the mixing of parental DNAs at the moment of fer-\ntilisation. Sperm provide only DNA. But an egg contains\nmore than just the maternal complement of DNA to match\nthat provided by the paternal sperm. It has in addition all\nthe cellular apparatus required to bring both sets of the\nDNA together to play their part in the cellular orchestra, as\nwell as the mitochondria with their own independent DNA.\nFrom this moment of conception on, the maternal cellular\nmachinery is responsible for directing the activation of par-\nticular genes (DNA-sequences) and hence the synthesis of\nspecific proteins. These proteins in turn include some\nwhose function is to act as switches, regulators to turn on,\nand in due course turn off, other DNA-sequences. A con-\ntinuous cycle of synthetic activity begins in which DNA-se-\nquences are uncovered, transcribed into RNA, processed,\nspliced, edited, translated into proteins which then provide\nfeedback control to the DNA, perhaps switching off their\nown synthesis, perhaps switching on the synthesis of other\nproteins by uncovering other DNA-sequences or influenc-\ning the splicing and editing steps. This exquisitely timed\nand subtly orchestrated cellular symphony culminates in\ndue course in the synthesis of those proteins which begin\nthe process of replicating and segregating the chromo-\nsomes once more, enabling the cell to divide and the cycle\nto recommence.\nIn the digital information metaphor all these cellular\nmechanisms are dumb, because they do not carry \u201cinfor-\nmation.\u201d But it is the cellular machinery which times and\nedits the synthetic processes. Insofar as the information\nmetaphor is valid at all, it can be expressed only in the dy-\nnamic interaction between the DNA and the cellular sys-\ntem in which it is embedded. Cells make their own lifelines.\nThus in both the Mendelian and the biochemical senses\ngenes are only partially determinate entities within genomes.\nHow, when, and to what extent any gene is expressed \u2013 that\nis, how its sequence is translated into a functioning protein\n\u2013 depends on signals from the cell in which it is embedded,\nand, as this cell is itself at any one time in receipt of and re-\nsponding to signals not just from a single gene but from\nmany others which are simultaneously switched on or off,\nthe expression of any single gene is influenced by what is\nhappening in the whole of the rest of the genome.\nWhen we talk about the development of an organism as\nbeing a product of the interaction of genes and environ-\nment therefore, the phrase masks as much as it reveals. Nei-\nther \u201cgene\u201d nor \u201cenvironment\u201d is an unproblematic term. A\n\u201cgene\u201d as abstract determinant is quite different from the\ncomplex processing mechanisms which put together par-\nticular DNA sequences which define the primary se-\nquences of proteins. Nor are proteins merely defined as\ntheir primary sequences; they have complex secondary and\ntertiary structures which depend not just on their amino\nacid sequence but on their environment, on the presence\nof water, ions, and sometimes other small molecules, on\nacidity and alkalinity. The path from primary structure to\nfully fledged protein does not involve as many regulatory\nsteps as that from DNA to protein, but it contains orders of\ncomplexity which move us yet further away from the one\ngene \u2013 one protein heuristic. And as proteins themselves\nbecome assembled into higher order structures within the\ncell, yet further constraints come into play.\nThe school textbooks which start with Mendel and his ra-\ntios have it wrong. Without Mendel, genetics would never\nhave got off to such a start and he deserves honour for his\nexperiments. But the founders of a field, by choosing ex-\nperimental systems which seem to give clear-cut answers,\noften also produce an appearence of simplicity which is \nultimately misleading. The famous and paradigmatic Men-\ndelian ratios are the results of rather special cases, the phe-\nnotypic expressions of enzyme pathways rather little influ-\nenced by environmental circumstance, perhaps just\nbecause they reflect relatively trivial features of that phe-\nnotype. By contrast, the expression of most genes is modi-\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 877\nfied at several levels. It is affected by which other genes are\npresent in the genome of the particular organism, by the\ncellular environment, the extracellular environment, and, in\nthe case of multicellular organisms, by the extra-organismic\nenvironment. Example: the ambiguous consequences of\nknockout mutations. In many cases in which genes coding\nfor proteins which are supposed to have vital functions\nwithin the cellular economy have been deleted, the absence\nboth of the gene and of the protein whose synthesis it codes\nfor seem to make little observable difference to the life of\nthe animal. It has \u201cno phenotype.\u201d This does not mean that\nthe protein concerned does not play a vital role in the cel-\nlular economy; rather it is a demonstration of the power of\ndevelopmental plasticity, of functional redundancy in the\norganism. Redundancy assists stability; it means that there\nmay be many alternative routes that the cell and the organ-\nism can adopt during development which can lead to an es-\nsentially identical end-point. In the presence of a particular\ngene and protein, one route is adopted, and in their absence\nanother is taken. Once again, there is no necessary linear\npath between gene and organism. Such plasticity is not in-\nfinite; there are sharp limits to the tolerance of any gene \u2013\nor any phenotype \u2013 to environmental change. Outside these\nlimits, the response is to curl up and die. But within them,\nthe expression of any gene may be defined in terms of\nDobzhansky\u2019s concept of norm of reaction \u2013 rather out of\nfashion amongst today\u2019s theorists who prefer a modern ver-\nsion of preformationism, in which genes are prime movers.\nChapter 6: Lifelines\nAt the heart of modern biology lies the issue of the nature\nof individual living units \u2013 organisms. Their lifelines may\nrange over many orders of magnitude in both time and\nspace. Some arise essentially fully developed, like a newly\nbudded yeast, others grow to a reasonably stable adulthood\nbefore ageing and decaying, others grow incrementally\nthroughout their lives. Yet others go through a series of rad-\nical transformations in which entire body plans become re-\nconstructed, as when egg becomes caterpillar becomes\nchrysalis becomes butterfly. Life persists not in three but in\nfour dimensions \u2013 a persistence, which is above all depen-\ndent upon the maintenance of order: order within the cell,\norder within the organism, and order in the relationship of\nthe organism to the world outside it. Genes and genomes\nneither contain the future of the organism, nor are they to\nbe regarded, as in modern metaphors, as architects\u2019 blue-\nprints or information theorists\u2019 codebearers. They are no\nmore and no less than an essential part of the toolkit with\nand by which organisms construct their own futures.\nNeither cells nor organisms can be considered in isola-\ntion from their own external environments. The boundary\nbetween cell and environment is its semi-permeable mem-\nbrane across which all trafficking must occur. For single-\ncelled organisms, the environment of the cell is obviously\nalso that of the organism, the ever fluctuating external\nworld, inherently patchy. Some regions may be antithetical\nto survival \u2013 too hot, too dry, too acid \u2013 some may be rich\nin food sources, others poor. Faced with such patchiness,\nmany single-celled organisms can take steps to seek out\nmore favourable conditions (e.g., cilia and flagella); but\ntheir power to choose a favourable environment is limited\nby the range of environments available, and survival will\nalso depend on the ability of the organism to adapt to less\nthan optimum conditions. (Hence the operon, which is the\nmechanism whereby the organism in interaction with its\nenvironment determines which of its available genes are to\nbe active at any one time.)\nSuch interactions between cells and environments be-\ncome more complex for a multicellular organisms. Buffered\nby a regulated internal environment, cells no longer need\nthe operon mechanism but instead lose their autonomy\nwithin the greater unity of the organism. They have sur-\nrendered their capacity for replication and their totipo-\ntency. They become specialised, as liver or brain, leaf or\nroot. In the course of this specialisation, as ontogeny pro-\nceeds, particular DNA-sequences are switched on or off in\ndefined temporal sequences. It is no longer only a case of\nproceeding through the cell cycle to division, but of estab-\nlishing cells with an appropriate structure, shape, and pat-\ntern of enzymes to function as part of a particular organ. To\nensure harmony at a multicellular rather than a cellular\nlevel, each cell has to be able to respond to the presence of\nits neighbours and to signals from distant parts of the or-\nganism (hence hormones, transmitters, modulators, etc.)\narriving at its membrane surface. The cellular lifeline has\nbecome subordinated to that of the organism.\nLike the term \u201cgene,\u201d the term \u201cenvironment\u201d is thus\ncomplex and many-layered. For individual gene-sized se-\nquences of DNA, the environment is constituted by the rest\nof the genome and the cellular machinery in which it is em-\nbedded; for the cell, the buffered milieu in which it floats;\nfor the organism, the external physical, living, and social\nworlds. Which features of the external world constitute \u201cthe\nenvironment\u201d differ from species to species; every organ-\nism thus has an environment tailored to its needs. Even for\nthe individual gene, the genomic background against which\nit is expressed differs during the cell cycle as other genes\nare switched on and off. Outside the organism, change is\nvirtually the only constancy. Stasis is death.\nBoundaries between organism and environment are not\nfixed. Organisms are constantly absorbing parts of their en-\nvironment into themselves as food, and as constantly mod-\nifying their surroundings by working on them, by excreting\nwaste products, or by modifying the world to suit their\nneeds, from birds\u2019 nests to beaver dams and termite\nmounds. Organisms and environment interpenetrate. Ab-\nstracting an organism from its environment, ignoring this\ndialectic of interpenetration, is a reductionist step which\nmethodology may demand but which will always mislead.\nNor are organisms passive responders to their environ-\nments. They actively choose, and work to change them.\nThe first phases of the life cycle are those of development.\nFrom the moment of fertilisation, cells grow, divide, and\nhence multiply. Daughter cells begin to align themselves\nwith respect one to the other, to migrate to specific regions\nwithin the developing embryo. Within each cell, particular\ngenes are switched on, others off, in intricate sequences, as\noriginally totipotent cells become specialised and the ma-\nture form of the organism unrolls from its undifferentiated\nstate. From very early in their development, organisms have\nto be capable simultaneously of quasi-independent exis-\ntence and of growing further towards maturity. Moreover,\nthe properties that enable them at any one moment to main-\ntain their existence are not always merely miniature forms\nof those they will need in adulthood. This is obvious for some\nlife forms. Frogs\u2019 eggs become tadpoles become frogs. Each\nRose: Lifelines\n878 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nstage requires a radical transformation of body plan, yet one\nduring which the functions necessary to life must be pre-\nserved. But it is also true in quite subtle ways for organisms\nwhich seem to show linear developmental trajectories.\nWhen a newborn baby suckles at its mother\u2019s breast, the\nsuckling reflex is not simply an undeveloped form of the\nchewing technique that will be needed when the child\nswitches to solid food; quite different neural and mechani-\ncal processes are involved. Life demands of all its forms that\nthey are able simultaneously to be and to become.\nThe unrolling processes of development are best under-\nstood in terms of specificity and plasticity. Many ontoge-\nnetic processes are relatively unmodifiable by experience\n(e.g., relatively fixed development of the visual system). But\nplasticity is also necessary (e.g., alterations to visual cortex\nneuronal connectivity dependent on rearing environment).\nSpecificity and plasticity are embedded properties of the\norganism; both are completely made possible by the genes,\nand completely made possible by the environment. They\ncannot be partitioned.\nTwo contrasting metaphors have been used to describe\nthe process by which multicellular organisms develop: se-\nlection and instruction. Consider the human brain, with its\nhighly ordered pattern of characteristically shaped and lo-\ncated neurons. From conception to birth requires the gen-\neration of about a million cells an hour, whilst during post-\nnatal development some 30,000 synapses a second will be\ncreated under each square centimetre of cortex, until the\nfull complement is present. Development requires the or-\ndered birth and migration of these cells. To arrive at the cor-\nrect target site both distant and local signals must be in-\nvolved (e.g., role of trophic factors). However, the\nmigrating cells or growing axons also need to keep in step\nwith one another; each has to know who its neighbours are.\nThe diffusion of a local gradient molecule, together with\nthe presence of some type of chemosensors on the axon sur-\nface, could enable each to determine whether it has neig-\nbours to its right and left and to maintain step with them.\nPart of this process \u2013 the achievement of long-range or-\nder \u2013 is compatible with a cooperative, instructionist\nmodel, but the overproduction of neurons and synapses im-\nplies also ultimate selection amongst cells or connections\ncompeting for targets. Selection in this sense can account\nfor local but not distant processes. Instructive and selective\nmechanisms are only part of the picture of development.\nThe maintenance of stable order requires the collective, co-\noperative properties of the entire ensemble of cells. Each\ndepends on the others in the creation and preservation of\nthe dynamic pattern of connections which impose new pat-\nterns on the world beyond the organism. Development is\nessentially a constructivist process; the developing organ-\nism, in its being and its becoming, in its specificity and its\nplasticity, constructs its own future.\nEven the constructivist model of development discussed\nabove however implies a degree of determinism, albeit a\nricher concept than that of the unidimensional gene. But\nwe need to go beyond this in emphasising the role of\nchance, of contingency, at all levels of analysis of living sys-\ntems. Consider the microlevel of the individual cell and its\nsubcellular components. Biochemists deal not with individ-\nual cells or molecules but with aggregates of millions, and\non this scale properties become relatively predictable. But\nwhat is predictable for the mass does not apply to the indi-\nvidual (e.g., there are only about 30 hydrogen ions in any\nsingle mitochondrion). Chance and contingency affect all\ncellular processes (e.g., numbers of bristles on Drosophila\nlegs; different foetal circumstances for identical twins de-\npending on placental relationships).\nOrganisms are supposed to maintain homeostasis. But in\nfact the set points around which conditions fluctuate are not\nconstant but vary momentarily, diurnally, monthly, and over\na lifetime. Furthermore, they are maintained dynamically,\nnot statically. Hence homeodynamics. Seeing organisms as\nmerely homeostatic is to deny them lifelines. Each of our\npresents is shaped by and can only be understood by our\npasts, our personal, unique, developmental history as an or-\nganism. Even the moment-to-moment stability of the or-\nganism is maintained not statically but dynamically; mole-\ncules and cells turn over on timescales varying from\nminutes to months. Why this ceaseless flux?\nThe answer is simple: living systems need to be dynamic\nto survive, able to adjust themselves to the fluctuations\nwhich, even in the best-buffered internal milieu, their co-\noperative existence as part of the greater unity of the or-\nganism demands. It is to this irreducible dynamism as the\ngenerator of stable order that we must turn in order to un-\nderstand how, having constructed itself through the pro-\ncesses of development, the organism is able to preserve its\nintegrity and act upon the external world. These are the\nphenomena of autopoiesis, a concept introduced by Matu-\nrana and Varela (1980).\nInternal cellular stability depends on two features. First,\ncells and organisms are thermodynamically open systems\nfar from equilibrium, which for their existence depend on\na continuous energy flow, generated through the catabolic\/\nanabolic cycle which results in the synthesis of ATP, ulti-\nmately through the activities of autotrophic organisms (pri-\nmarily photosynthesis). Equations relevant to closed equi-\nlibrium systems are largely inapplicable to living processes.\nSecond, the existence of an interacting metabolic web:\nindividual reactions are catalysed by enzymes; by sequences\nof reactions, like glycolysis, by chains of enzymes whose\noverall rates are seemingly controlled by individual enzyme\nkinetic properties, so that in a chain the slowest reaction be-\ncomes the controller. However, just as in a living cell one\ncannot abstract an individual enzyme reaction from the\nmetabolic dance of the molecules, so one cannot abstract\nany single reaction pathway. Most of its components are in-\nvolved in many different reaction pathways, knitted to-\ngether by multiple interconnections. Once such a web\nreaches a sufficient degree of complexity, it becomes\nstrong, stable, and capable of resisting change; the stability\nno longer resides in the individual components, the en-\nzymes, their substrates and products, but in the web itself.\nThe more interconnections, the greater the stability and the\nless its dependence on any individual component.\nFurther, the cellular web has a degree of flexibility which\npermits it to reorganise itself in response to injury or dam-\nage. Self-organisation and self-repair are its essential au-\ntopoietic properties. These properties of stability and self-\norganisation are the key to the fundamental irreducibility of\nliving cells. The stability is dynamic, and depends in part on\nmetabolic oscillatory processes (e.g., calcium waves). Meta-\nbolic organisation is not merely the sum of cellular parts,\nand cannot be predicted from individual enzyme reactions\nand substrate concentrations.\nCells are not simply bags containing semi-random mixes\nbut contain many internal structures (nucleus, mitochon-\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 879\ndria, etc). Each represents a separate compartment within\nwhich relatively segregated sets of reactions can occur.\nCommunication between these compartments, in terms of\nexchange of substances and signals between them, takes\nplace through selective membranes, which act as gate-\nkeepers across which specialised signalling molecules and\nsmall inorganic ions control access. Homeodynamic order\nwithin the cell is thus maintained not merely through the\nself-stabilising properties of metabolic webs, but through\ninternal structural constraints provided by semi-permeable\nlipid membranes in which are embedded proteins which\nrecognise and regulate the entry and exit of key metabo-\nlites. Ionic changes also modulate the microenvironment\nwithin which protein structure is modulated, complex\nstructures such as microtubules and ribosomes can self-\nassemble, and enzyme-linked reactions occur.\nLifelines, then, are not embedded in genes. Their exis-\ntence is posited on homeodynamics. Their four dimensions\nare autopoietically constructed through the interplay of\nphysical forces, the intrinsic chemistry of lipids and pro-\nteins, the self-organising and stabilising properties of com-\nplex metabolic webs, and the specificity of genes which per-\nmit the plasticity of ontogeny. The organism is both the\nweaver and the pattern it weaves, the choreographer and\nthe dance that is danced.\nChapter 7: Universal Darwinism?\n\u201cDarwinism\u201d has become an almost universal \u2013 and often\nabused \u2013 term. Darwinian protagonists offer a \u201ctough-\nminded\u201d ultra-Darwinism as a universal mechanism to ex-\nplain all phenomena of life. Philosophers follow them; Den-\nnett writes a book entitled Darwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea (1995)\nin which Darwinian mechanisms are described as a \u201cuni-\nversal acid\u201d which eats away at everything it touches. Edel-\nman (1987) interprets the brain processes concerned with\nexperience, memory, and consciousness as representing\n\u201cneural Darwinism.\u201d Hull claims that scientific theories\nthemselves win or lose the struggle for acceptance accord-\ning to Darwinian mechanisms. One reads of Darwinian psy-\nchology, Darwinian medicine, Darwinian economics.\nDawkins caps the lot with his claim that human culture it-\nself operates on Darwinian principles in which the units of\ntransmission are not genes but \u201cmemes.\u201d It may be time to\ntry to rescue Darwin from some of his oversolicitous mod-\nern friends if we are to do justice, but no more than justice,\nto the part he and his ideas have played in the history of bi-\nology and in our understanding of living processes.\nBefore Darwin, the interpretation of life on earth was\ntrapped within a mode of thinking imposed by biblical tra-\nditions. Species were immutable, linked in a great chain of\nbeing, beginning with the lowliest and ending with that\nacme of god\u2019s creation, humankind (Man) himself. The in-\ndustrial revolution shattered this stability; change (and evo-\nlution means simply change over time) became acceptable.\nThe discovery of fossils implied extinct species, whose his-\ntory could be dated. Before Charles Darwin, both Erasmus\nDarwin and Lamarck had sought to describe and account\nfor such changes. It was Charles Darwin who offered the\nmechanism by way of a simple syllogism:\n1. Like breeds like, with variations.\n2. Some of these varieties are more favourable (to the\nbreeder or to nature) than others.\n3. All creatures produce more offspring than can survive\nto breed in their turn.\n4. The more favoured varieties are more likely to survive\nlong enough to breed.\n5. Hence there will be more of the favoured variety in\nthe next generation, and\n6. Thus species will tend to evolve over time.\nThis process is natural selection. As a syllogism it has an in-\nexorable logicality. If 1, 2, and 3 are true, 4, 5, and 6 follow\ninevitably. This is why philosophers such as Dennett are\nable to describe it as a universal mechanism. Yet for Dar-\nwin there were major theoretical difficulties at the heart of\nthe theory; the mechanism of transmission both of similar-\nities and variations; the classic argument from design; and\nthe problem of speciation.\nDarwin\u2019s achievement was to demolish the idea of the\nimmutability of species and, even more important, of a\ngreat chain of being. Humans are no longer at the pinnacle\nof life. Instead, living forms can be drawn as related to one\nanother as the branches and twigs of a bush. All of us cur-\nrently alive, amoebae as well as humans, are in this respect\nequal, the successful survivors of evolutionary history.\nThere is no scale of life on the basis of which one can judge\nsome currently living forms as \u201clower\u201d and others as\n\u201chigher,\u201d more or less \u201cevolutionarily successful.\u201d A further\ncrucial feature of Darwinism is its insistance on the role of\nchance. Natural selection abolishes purpose from evolu-\ntion, and, some felt in consequence, from human life itself.\n7.1. Variation. The problem of transmission was resolved\nwith the theory of the gene, although when Mendel was re-\ndiscovered at the turn of the century mutational change\nseemed to replace natural selection, and it was not until the\n\u201cneo-Darwinian synthesis\u201d of Fisher, Haldane, and Sewall\nWright around 1930 that it was seen that the two theories\nsupported rather than contradicted each other.\n7.2. Heritability. Fisher\u2019s synthesis was directed at trying to\nunderstand the contributions of genes and environment to\nvariation in populations. In a uniform environment all the\nvariance would be contributed by the genes, and with iden-\ntical genes all the variance would be contributed by the en-\nvironment. But genotypes and environments both vary and\nthe purpose of heritability estimates is to try to tease them\napart. To do so however, it is necessary to make some sim-\nplifying assumptions. Variance describes the way in which\nany particular measure of a trait in a population is distrib-\nuted about the mean value for that population, made up of\na component contributed by the genes and a component\ncontributed by the environment, which together can be\nadded to give a total of nearly 100%. The remainder, which\nto make the mathematics work has to be a rather small pro-\nportion, is considered to be the product of an interaction\nbetween genes and environment. If genotypes are distrib-\nuted randomly across environments, it is possible to esti-\nmate heritability, which defines the proportion of the vari-\nance which is genetically determined. However, the\nmathematics only works if all the relevant simplifying as-\nsumptions are made. If there is a great deal of interaction\nbetween genes and environment, that is if genes behave ac-\ncording to Dobzhansky\u2019s (1973) vision of norms of reaction,\nif genes interact with each other, and if the relationships are\nnot linear and additive but interactive, the entire mathe-\nmatical apparatus of heritability estimates falls apart. Thus\nRose: Lifelines\n880 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nthe meaningful application of heritability estimates is only\npossible in very special cases, from which the majority of\ntraits of interest outside the special world of artificial selec-\ntion are likely to escape. Furthermore the figure derived for\nthe heritability is itself dependent on the environment \u2013\nthat is, if you change the environment, the heritability esti-\nmate changes.\nThese caveats perhaps help to explain why heritability es-\ntimates have been so persistently misunderstood. They be-\ncome wholly misleading when applied to aspects of human\nbehaviour. Milk yield is a phenotype which is reasonably\nstraightforward to measure. But intelligence? Political ten-\ndency? Likelihood of getting divorced? Religiosity? Job sat-\nisfaction? As one cannot treat human populations quite like\nbreeding experiments with wheat or cattle, and distribute\ngenotypes across environments, one has to make do with\nwhat between them nature and society provide. The stan-\ndard techniques have involved comparing traits in siblings,\nMZ and DZ twins, and the use of adoption studies. The\nproblems are manifold. To mention just two, separated\ntwins tend to be placed in rather similar environments;\nwhilst adoptive parents are unlikely to treat their adoptive\nchild \u201cexactly\u201d as they do a natural one, and are far more\nlikely to be anxiously on the lookout for tendencies which\nreveal the child to be \u201ctaking after\u201d some undesirable char-\nacter of its natural parent. Such real life problems are sim-\nply swept aside in the process of fitting the numbers ob-\ntained into the complex statistical manipulations required\nto generate the seemingly objective heritability estimate.\nAs a result, seemingly bizarre traits turn out to have \u201chigh\nheritability,\u201d for which the most parsimonious explanation\nis that they demonstrate the inappropriateness of attempt-\ning to apply a mathematical formalism devised for plant and\nanimal breeding to such dubious phenotypic characters as\nthe diversity of human social behaviour and attitudes. Yet\nsome behaviour geneticists argue that even such high her-\nitabilities underestimate the true influence of the genes.\nBouchard (1997) proposes that our genes \u201cpredispose\u201d us\nto seek environments congenial to the genetic imperatives.\nThus genes create environments, and \u201cenvironment\u201d \u2013\nwhatever that term may mean \u2013 ceases to be a truly inde-\npendent variable in the heritability equations. It is the\ngenes, therefore, which are a major cause of everything\nfrom childhood accidents to divorce in midlife, for these\ngenes lead their owners to place themselves in situations in\nwhich the probability of accident or divorce increases. Like\nthe claims for the \u201cextended phenotype,\u201d this argument\nperversely swallows the four-dimensional universe of life-\nlines entirely into the double helix of DNA.\n7.3. Adaptation. The argument from design is confronted\nhead-on in Dawkins\u2019s The Blind Watchmaker and its suc-\ncessors (1986; 1995): \u201cWhat use is half an eye,\u201d he asks, and\nanswers \u201cOne percent better than 49% of an eye, and the\ndifference is significant.\u201d The trouble with this argument is\nthat there is no way of determining whether, amongst our\nevolutionary ancestors, 50% of an eye was really signifi-\ncantly better in Darwinian terms \u2013 that it contributed sig-\nnificantly more to reproductive success \u2013 than 49%. It\nwould depend what other costs the organism accrued in\nachieving this 1% advantage, and how much having eyes\ncontributed to its success in finding food and avoiding\npredators so as to increase its chances of finding a mate and\nhence reproducing. There is of course no evidence on these\nissues, and so the claim must remain an undemonstrable as-\nsertion, although one which most biologists will find rea-\nsonably convincing. In the classical Popperian sense, such\nstories about evolution are unfalsifiable. All that we can do\nis to offer plausible accounts of how a process may have oc-\ncurred or a structure evolved.\n7.4. Sexual selection. If all adaptation serves the function\nof enhancing survival, why do so many animals \u2013 especially\nmales \u2013 have traits which seem on the face of it to be inim-\nical to long and efficient life (e.g., the peacock\u2019s tail)? Dar-\nwin\u2019s interpretation of sexual selection was that females\nwere motivated to choose, and hence select beauty. More\nmodern versions argue instead that seemingly dysfunc-\ntional adornments are markers of good health and hence\ngood genes. Whichever version of the theory is adopted, so-\nciobiologists have sought to press it into service to provide\nan evolutionary \u201cDarwinian\u201d explanation for the prefer-\nences expected in human sexual choice, once again treating\nmetaphor as if it were homology. For example, competition\namongst human males for mates is discussed as the macro-\nversion of what is said to be the micro-level competition\namongst individual sperm to be \u201cthe one\u201d to successfully\npenetrate and fertilise the egg. Males and their sperm com-\npete, females and their ova quiescently await their fate. The\nproblem is that, as with most human extensions of evolu-\ntionary mechanisms, but in an even more extreme form,\nsuch accounts simply cannot encompass the rich diversity\nof human experience, and instead have recourse to tradi-\ntional and often sexist caricatures which ignore the histori-\ncal and anthropological evidence of variation in social prac-\ntices across time and space and instead treat current\nwestern norms \u2013 or rather, assertive restatements of what\nthe authors perceive as those norms, for they show as little\nrespect for sociology as they do for history or anthropology\n\u2013 as if they were human universals.\n7.5. Altruism. With the claims for the genetic mechanism\nand evolutionary significance of altruistic behaviour, we are\nat the heart of sociobiological thinking. If organisms seek to\nmaximise their reproductive success, then how do we ac-\ncount for birds which on detecting a predator, draw atten-\ntion to it, and simultaneously to themselves by uttering\nwarning cries? Ought they not instead try to make them-\nselves as inconspicuous as possible, so as to diminish the\nchance of being picked off? Earlier group-selectionist\nideas, once discarded, are creeping back into the literature\nonce more, but the dominant mode of explanation is kin se-\nlection, a mathematical formulation which, if one grants its\nbasic assumptions \u2013 that is, that living forms exist primarily\nto perpetuate their genes \u2013 is as inevitable a syllogism as the\noriginal Darwinian formulation of natural selection. Al-\nthough I see no reason to doubt the principle, proving it is\nharder. Certainly, behaviour which might be defined as al-\ntruistic does occur amongst group-living animals, although\nequally there is no shortage of evidence as to competitive-\nness amongst them. The empirical question is whether ap-\nparently altruistic behaviour can be shown to benefit pref-\nerentially the kin of the altruist rather than the group as a\nwhole. Perhaps in response to the relative weakness of the\ndata, Trivers (1971) offered an alternative version: recipro-\ncal altruism \u2013 an act performed to benefit non-kin, but\nwhich is performed in expectation of a subsequent return\nof the compliment. And once again, human sociobiologists\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 881\nhave sought, on the slightest of evidence, to deprive human\nunselfish behaviour of any function other than one of these\nforms of selectionist altruism, once again reducing metaphor\nto homology.\n7.6. Speciation. It may seem extraordinary, but the Dar-\nwinian syllogism provides no mechanism for the formation\nof new species, which was after all ostensibly what The ori-\ngin was all about. All that is claimed is that in any given cir-\ncumstances, external conditions (the environment, nature)\nwill favour the perpetuation of varieties which can do their\nspecies-thing a bit better than the rest. For example, Ket-\ntlewell\u2019s peppered moths, which also demonstrate another\nfundamental point. A \u201cmore favoured variety\u201d is one which\nis favoured under current circumstances. Evolution by nat-\nural selection can respond only to the current situation. It\ncannot predict the future. At one point of the species tra-\njectory in time it is the peppered form which has the greater\nsurvival value, at a later time the melanic, and then again\nthe peppered. The environmental change occurs and nat-\nural selection trails along behind, following and responding\nbut never leading and never predicting. Such evolutionary\nprocesses could obviously modify a species over time to\nsuch a degree that its members would no longer be able to\nmate fertilely with their ancestors, could these be brought\nback to life. In this sense, species can gradually be trans-\nformed through processes of natural selection steadily\ntracking environmental change. But this still does not ex-\nplain how natural selection alone can result in one preex-\nisting species splitting into two. For this, additional mech-\nanisms are required; presumably primarily geographical\nseparation and founder effects, of which the most famous\nexample is Darwin\u2019s own, the Galapagos finches. But could\nthis be all? For the orthodox ultra-Darwinian, there is noth-\ning else available.\nChapter 8: Beyond ultra-Darwinism\nUltra-Darwinism has a metaphysical foundation: the pur-\npose of life is reproduction of the genes embedded in the\n\u201clumbering robots\u201d which constitute living organisms.\nThere follow two premises: (1) the unit of life is an individ-\nual gene whose sole activity is to create the conditions for\nits own reproduction by directing the development and\nphysiological function of the organism; (2) most aspects of\nthe phenotype are adaptive, selected for by the honing\nforce of natural selection. This metaphysic derives from a\ncombination of Hobbes and Smith. Life is a war of all\nagainst all, but the invisible hand of the market generates\neven cooperative behaviour from competitive individual-\nism. A further element is a restatement in scientific form of\nthe theology of preformationism. Our task is to preserve\nand transmit copies of our DNA.\nIt follows that the prime function of every living organ-\nism is to maximise its inclusive fitness \u2013 that is, to ensure\nthe maximal spread of its own and its close relatives\u2019 genes\nin succeeding generations. This determinism worries Daw-\nkins and others, who therefore claim that we have the ca-\npacity to rebel against the tyranny of our genes. But if the\npower to rebel does not itself come from our genes, then\nthe argument implies a sort of Cartesian dualism, and the\nmechanical materialism of selfish genery trips over into a\ntype of idealism.\nThe case against ultra-Darwinism rests on the following\nclaims: (1) The individual gene is not the only level at which\nselection occurs. (2) Natural selection is not the only force\ndriving evolutionary change. (3) Organisms are not indefi-\nnitely flexible to change; selection is \u201ctable d\u2019h\u00f4te\u201d and not\n\u201c\u00e0 la carte.\u201d (4) Organisms are active players in their own\ndestiny.\n1. Any individual gene can only be expressed against the\nbackground of the whole of the rest of the genome. Genes\nproduce gene products which in turn influence other genes,\nswitching them on and off, modulating their activity and\nfunction. If selection ultimately determines whether a par-\nticular gene survives or not, it can only do so in context. A\ngene is only selected if it results in a selectable phenotypic\nchange \u2013 yet what is required to produce such a change is\nnot one but many actual biochemical gene-size lengths of\nDNA. Furthermore, Weismann\u2019s barrier is not as imperme-\nable as implied, so developmental processes also affect\ntransgenerational gene transmission. Waddington argued\nthat developmental processes in multicellular organisms\ncould help to both direct and, as he put it, canalise poten-\ntially favourable mutations. Bonner (1974) identified two\nroutes around Weismann\u2019s barrier. Thus both plants and\nsuch animals as Hydra retain the capacity to differentiate\ninto somatic cells or to become sequestered as gametes or\nto remain totipotent. Those cells which remain totipotent\nretain the prospect of becoming gametes after an indefinite\nnumber of cell divisions \u2013 and this means that any genetic\nvariation occurring during those divisions will be heritable.\nThat totipotency is available even to mammals is now\nproven by the cloned sheep Dolly and her successors. Fur-\nther, during development, originally totipotent cells divide,\nbecome determined, and migrate to appropriate positions\nwithin the developing embryo, resulting in competive\/se-\nlective mechanisms operating at the cellular level; cellular\nvariation will affect the outcome of such competition.\nSo selection acts on genes, on genomes, and on cells, no-\ntably during development. But for multicellular organisms\nit is ultimately the organism as an integral unit which will or\nwill not reproduce and hence dispatch copies of its genes\ninto subsequent generations. So natural selection in the\nsense that Darwin originally conceived it can only occur\nthrough the actions and properties of the entire organism,\nits phenotype. For ultra-Darwinists that is not a problem;\nthe phenotype is merely a proxy for the genes it contains,\nthe gene\u2019s way of making copies of itself. But this implies a\ndirect relationship, one-for-one, between gene and pheno-\ntype, and this \u201cempty phenotype\u201d view ignores develop-\nment.\nThe fact that selection occurs at many levels dampens the\neffects of change at any one level. For instance, mutation\nrates in DNA are relatively constant, yet these are not nec-\nessarily reflected in phenotypic change (hence Eldredge\nand Gould\u2019s punctuated equilibrium). Furthemore there is\na vast amount of hidden phenotypic diversity (e.g., isoen-\nzymes) which is likely to be neutral so far as selection pres-\nsures are concerned.\nFinally in this context, organisms do not exist in isolation\nbut in populations, and populations in ecological commu-\nnities involving many hundreds or thousands of different\nspecies locked into relationships which may be competitive\nor cooperative. Thus within species, evolutionary stable\nstrategies (Maynard Smith) mean that any individual\u2019s char-\nacter may or may not be selectively favourable, depending\non the balance between that individual and others in the\nRose: Lifelines\n882 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\npopulation, whilst the fact that any species\u2019 niche is defined\nin the context of all other species within an ecosystem\n(predator or prey, mutualistic or commensal, or even, in\nMargulis\u2019s term, symbiogenic, like mitochondria) and that\nall species are evolving, means that the evolution of any one\nis shaped and constrained by that of many others. Evolution\nmeans coevolution, built on both competitive and cooper-\native mechanisms.\n2. Selection mechanisms include competition for scarce\nresources, sexual and kin selection, founder effects, expan-\nsion of populations into new niches, selective predation,\nand coevolution of populations and species. Selection at any\ngiven level of the hierarchy between individual genes and\necosystems does not automatically imply selection and evo-\nlutionary change at any other; there is sufficient flexibility\nand redundancy within living systems to make such tight\ncoupling unnecessary. But not all phenotypic variation is\nadaptive, and not all change is selective. Contingency also\napplies (e.g., Gould\u2019s [1989] account of the Burgess shale\nfossils; dinosaur extinction following climate change). And\nwhat constitutes an adaptation is itself problematic, and\nevolutionary accounts become Panglossian Just-So stories\n(e.g., flamingo plumage as pink to confuse predators rather\nthan as a consequence of their shrimp diet). Gould and\nLewontin (1975) used the famous spandrels of San Marco\nas an example of how adaptationist assumptions could be\nmisleading; their account has been criticised by Dennett\n(1995); however, architectural reassessment of the role of\nspandrels (pendentives) favours the original interpretation.\n3. Within the adaptationist programme, the trajectory\nthat any lifeline can take is ultimately limited only by the\nquestion of whether it is adaptive. Of course, evolution is\ncumulative and has to build on whatever materials it has at\nhand. So to arrive at any adaptive structure, behaviour, or\nmolecular property there has to be a legitimate route from\nwhere the present state of the system is to some presum-\nably more adapted place elsewhere. And these constraints\ndetermine what is or is not evolutionarily possible (e.g., lim-\nits on the size of single cells, and of multicellular organisms\n\u2013 surface area\/volume and mass relationships, skeletal\nproperties, etc., set by chemistry and physics). But there are\ndeeper prospects opened by discussion of \u201claws of form\u201d\n(e.g., Darcy Thompson\u2019s topological transformations; radi-\nolaria crystalline forms, pentadactyl limbs; pinecone pat-\nterns in Fibonacci series; the role of morphogenetic fields).\n4. The metaphor of natural selection is one in which na-\nture sets a series of challenges which organisms either pass,\nin which case they are privileged enough to pass copies of\ntheir genes on to a successor generation, or they fail. By\ncontrast, the autopoietic vision implies that organisms ac-\ntively choose and transform their environments, to adjust\nand appropriate them to their own ends (e.g., unicells mov-\ning to food rich environments, growing axons finding and\nmodifying targets, etc.). Organisms change environments\nand environments have their own trajectories constantly\ntransformed, not merely by the workings out of the inani-\nmate forces of weather, temperature, and cosmic history,\nbut above all by the interactions of myriad lifeforms.\nChapter 9: Origin myths\nWhere once the definition of being alive was to be a breath-\ning, metabolising, environment-sensing and responding or-\nganism, molecular biologists tend to see the basic function\nof life as the power to replicate, and the basic unit of life is\ntherefore a molecule with this power, a naked nucleic acid\npolymer. There are religious undertones to his view that in\nthe beginning was the word. But could life have begun with\na naked molecule of DNA or RNA? So-called self-replicat-\ning experimental procedures are already quite complex.\nThey must occur in a test-tube which serves as a surrogate\ncell, including all the necessary mix of enzymes, ions, and\ncontrolled temperatures. It follows that accurate replica-\ntion could only have emerged long after the development\nof cell-like structures capable of such crucial living pro-\ncesses as metabolism, growth, and division. What charac-\nterises all living organisms, including ancient fossils, is the\npresence of a cell membrane, and such cells must precede\nreplicators.\nOrigin of life theorists and experiments have shown how\nabiotic synthesis of amino acids and other organic precur-\nsors is possible. The biochemical parsimony which charac-\nterises modern living forms suggests that these substances\nmust have appeared prior to their organisation into repli-\ncating organisms. Life consists primarily of arrangements of\nthe elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, to-\ngether with smaller quantities of phosphorus and sulphur,\nions of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and some\nheavy metals. Compounds of these most abundant ele-\nments are thermodynamically unstable but capable of rela-\ntively long life in watery solution; their synthetic chemistry\nrequires energy but they trap energy easily in the form of\nsugars; they readily combine to form long chain molecules,\nlipids, polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids, espe-\ncially in a reducing atmosphere (Miller-Urey experiment).\nThe earth\u2019s early atmosphere provided this environment; it\nis life itself which has subsequently modified it by trapping\ncarbon and releasing oxygen. Oparin and Haldane pro-\nposed that droplets of concentrated organic chemicals\ncould concentrate out of a prebiotic soup (coacervate\ndrops). Other concentration mechanisms could include\nclay surfaces. Lipids spontaneously form micelles and\ndroplets surrounded by bimolecular membranes, within\nwhich the soup would be concentrated. These represent\nprotocells. Such cells would have another property seem-\ningly fundamental to life in that there would be an electro-\nchemical gradient across their membranes.\nThe next evolutionary step would be to stabilise the myr-\niad potential chemical reactions that could occur within the\nproto-cells. Kauffman\u2019s models suggest that, given enough\nmetabolic interactions, in due course catalytic and autocat-\nalytic relationships would arise, especially granted the pos-\nsibility of catalytic surfaces such as that provided by clay.\nComputer models of such processes show that a random set\nof chemicals in a constrained area soon settle into a robust\nand autopoietic metabolic web in which stable balances of\nconstituents result. Traffic across the liposome membrane\nwill bring new materials into the cell and excrete waste\nproducts, and cells which increase in size will simply split\ninto two.\nThus cell formation and division, and sophisticated meta-\nbolic stability, have all been achieved by originally abiotic\nprocesses, in which the properties which are characteristic\nof life are embedded not in a single molecular substituent\nbut in the entire system which constitutes the cell, and\nwithout replicators. The metabolic web must have ex-\ntended beyond any individual proto-cell to embrace the en-\nRose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 883\ntire population. If chemicals were to be exchanged between\ncells, by ingestion or by cell division, the reactions within\neach cell must have tended to converge.\nEven before the problem of accurate replication had\nbeen resolved, there would have been another more press-\ning problem, that of energy. An evolutionary bottleneck\nwould have been produced until the energy-generation\nproblem could be solved. Early chemoautotrophes would\nin due course have been replaced by photosynthesizing or-\nganisms, which in turn were responsible for changing the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere (and could later be embraced within\nmore complex organisms, as chloroplasts, by symbiogene-\nsis). Only after the development of effective energy-gener-\nating and utilising mechanisms, though presumably before\nthe development of the modern cellular systems, would it\nbe possible for nucleic acid based replication \u2013 probably\ninitially RNA \u2013 to emerge.\nOnce these molecules had been incorporated within the\nmetabolic web of the cell, they would offer a whole new\nrange of properties. For they would now achieve a level of\nfidelity in copying and reproduction which would have\nbeen unobtainable by mere random division without them.\nJust how this mechanism settled down into its present day\nform, based as it is on the trinity of DNA, RNA, and pro-\ntein, is a matter of intense speculation. Contingency, rather\nthan laws of molecular form or adaptation, may rule at this\npoint in the story. But once a particular set of nucleic acid-\namino acid correspondences had emerged, convergence\nwithin the web would be likely to help ensure its universal-\nity. In any event, the essential point is that once cells con-\ntaining these mechanisms had arisen, they would multiply\nrapidly and swamp out all others, as only they could pro-\nduce exact copies of themselves. Evolution, having gener-\nated nucleotide polymers within the primitive cells, had\nnow also produced a mechanism which could be relied\nupon to amplify them, and before long to conquer the earth\n\u2013 yet another reason why whatever the processes by which\nlife forms were first generated, so far as life on this planet\nis concerned, they cannot repeat themselves.\nChapter 10:The poverty of reductionism\nThis chapter shifts gears, to focus on reductionism as ide-\nology in human affairs. The primacy given to reductionist\nexplanations of human behaviour leads to claims, made by\nscientists but trumpeted by the media, that the origins of\neverything from sexual orientation to violence, criminality,\nand \u201ccompulsive shopping\u201d lie in the genes. Neurogenetics\nclaims to be able to answer the question of where, in a world\nfull of individual pain and social disorder, we should look\nnot merely to explain but even more potently to change our\ncondition. Although this is not a new debate, the apparent\npower of modern genetics gives it new force, and the ideo-\nlogues of neurogenetic determinism claim that their sci-\nence will in due course render sociology, economics, and\neven philosophy, redundant.\nNeurogenetic determinism is based on a faulty reductive\nsequence whose steps include: reification; arbitrary ag-\nglomeration; improper quantification; belief in statistical\n\u201cnormality\u201d; spurious localisation; misplaced causality; di-\nchotomous partitioning between genetic and environmen-\ntal causes; and confounding metaphor with homology. The\nissue at stake is the appropriate level of organisation of mat-\nter at which to seek causally effective determinants of the\nbehaviour of individuals and societies. The structure of the\nargument is similar whether the discussion focusses on in-\ntelligence, sexuality, or violence.\nReification converts a dynamic process into a static phe-\nnomenon. For example, violence as an interaction between\npeople becomes \u201caggressive behaviour,\u201d regarded as the\nproperty of an individual.\nArbitrary agglomeration lumps together many different\nreified interactions as if they were all exemplars of the one\ncharacter. Thus aggression becomes the term used to de-\nscribe processes as disparate as a man abusing his lover or\nchild, fights between football fans, strikers resisting police,\nracist attacks on ethnic minorities, and civil and national\nwars as if in fact they were all examples of the same under-\nlying mechanism of \u201canti-social behaviour\u201d (e.g., the claim\nthat a genetic abnormality in monoamine oxidase predis-\nposes to variants of these activities). Yet the identical act\nperformed in different contexts (e.g., war or peace) may be\nsocially desirable or undesirable (e.g., British troops in\nNorthern Ireland).\nImproper quantification argues that reified and agglom-\nerated characters can be given numerical values (e.g., the\nIQ scale, which reifies \u201cintelligence,\u201d agglomerates many\ndifferent processes within the term, and then claims to be\nable to provide a single number which defines where an in-\ndividual lies in the intelligence hierarchy). Belief in statisti-\ncal normality then assumes that in any given population the\ndistribution of such behavioural scores takes a Gaussian,\nnormal distribution. Yet such curves are a product of the\ntest design. There is no biological necessity for such a uni-\ndimensional distribution, nor for one in which the popula-\ntion shows such a convenient spread. Yet the power of this\nreified statistic is that it conflates two different concepts of\n\u201cnormality\u201d; it has normative implications, but also to lie\nmore than two standard deviations from the mean is to be\n\u201cabnormal\u201d (e.g., the bell curve).\nHaving reified processes into objects and arbitrarily\nquantified them, the reified object ceases to be a property\neven of the individual, but instead becomes that of a part of\nthe person (e.g., schizophrenic brains, genes \u2013 or even\nurine \u2013 rather than of brains, genes, or urine derived from\na person diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia). This\nshorthand of \u201cgay brains\u201d or \u201cselfish genes\u201d does more than\nmerely sell books for their scientific authors; it both reflects\nand endorses the modes of thought and explanation that\nconstitute neurogenetic determinism, for it disarticulates\nthe complex properties of individuals into isolated and lo-\ncalised lumps of biology.\nMisplaced causation is involved in aggressive encounters\nwhen people show dramatic changes in, for instance, the\nlevels of circulating steroid hormones and adrenalin in their\nbloodstream and the release of neurotransmitters in their\nbrains, all of which can be affected by drug treatments. A\nperson whose life history includes many such encounters is\nlikely to show lasting differences in a variety of brain and\nbody markers. But to describe such changes as if they were\nthe causes of particular behaviours is to mistake correlation\nor even consequence for cause. Drugs such as ritalin may\nmake children more tractable at school; the cause of their\nso-called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is unlikely\nto be too little amphetamine in their brains. The search for\n\u201cfirst causes\u201d seems to lead inevitably to genes.\nConfounding metaphor with homology occurs as follows.\nRose: Lifelines\n884 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nIf first causes are genetic, then they must have evolved and\nsimilar behaviours should be found in non-human animals.\nExample: \u201caggression,\u201d measured in rats by noting how long\nthey take to kill mice, and taking this as a surrogate for \u201cvi-\nolent behaviour\u201d in humans.\nReductionist ideology not only hinders biologists from\nthinking adequately about the phenomena we wish to un-\nderstand, it has two important social consequences: it\nserves to relocate social problems to the individual, thus\n\u201cblaming the victim\u201d rather than exploring the societal roots\nand determinants of a phenomenon; and second, it diverts\nattention and funding from the social to the molecular (e.g.,\nalcoholism research in the United States or Russia). For any\naspect of the living world, multiple forms of explanation are\npossible. But for any such phenomenon there are also de-\ntermining levels of explanation \u2013 those which most clearly\naccount for the specificity of the phenomenon and also\npoint to potential sites of intervention into it. Effective sci-\nence requires a better recognition of determining explana-\ntion and hence the determining level at which to intervene.\nFailing this it becomes a waste of human ingenuity and re-\nsources, a powerful ideological strategy of victim-blaming\nand a distraction from the real tasks that both science and\nsociety require.\nChapter 11: Making biology whole again\nThis chapter summarises the main arguments of the book\nin the form of ten slogans, as follows:\n1. Our history shapes our knowledge\n2. One world, many ways of knowing\n3. Levels of organisation\n4. It all depends\n5. Being and becoming\n6. Stability through dynamics\n7. Organism and environment interpenetrate\n8. Structure constrains evolution\n9. The past is the key to the present\n10. Life constructs its own future.\nTo conclude: for humans as for all other living organisms,\nthe future is radically unpredictable. This means that we\nhave the ability to construct our own futures, albeit in cir-\ncumstances not of our own choosing. And that it is there-\nfore our biology that makes us free.\nNOTE\n1.

The many previously published rebuttals to this\npernicious criticism are conveniently ignored by the author.\nIn an undeservedly gentle review of Not in our genes, an earlier\nideological polemic against sociobiology by Steven Rose (Lewon-\ntin et al. 1984), Patrick Bateson wrote,\nThe issues of evolution, individual development and current function\nare not the same. The majority of scientists who now call themselves so-\nciobiologists know it and say so. Therefore, to criticize the evolutionary\nand functional arguments of these people on the grounds that they are\ngenetic determinists is to make precisely the mistake that [E. O.] Wil-\nson made, treating different problems as if they were the same. Doubt-\nless, it spoils the fun when the hate-object ceases to be hateful, but\nRose, Kamin and Lewontin had a duty to deep themselves better in-\nformed about current developments in the subject they chose to attack\nso freely. (Bateson 1985)\nWhat was true then is even truer now. But for Steven Rose to\nhave troubled himself to learn what sociobiology is really about\nwould have definitely spoiled his fun, eliminating the \u201cneed\u201d to\nwrite his current book, Lifelines, which stridently covers much the\nsame ground as Not in our genes. Once again, the pre-eminent\ncharge is that sociobiologists believe in rigid genetic determinism\nin which possession of a given gene guarantees the development\nof a particular phenotype. Rose is keen to portray sociobiologists\nas drooling determinists because he wishes to demolish the disci-\npline by showing that there is no simple one-to-one relationship\nbetween gene and behavior. Rose makes this point at great length,\nbut his \u201cachievement\u201d is irrelevant, not only because sociobiolo-\ngists are as aware as he of the complexity of development, but also\nbecause sociobiologists leave it to others to study how genes and\nenvironment interact during behavioral development. As Bateson\nnoted, sociobiologists deal with the evolution and current function\nof complex social traits. Like all evolutionary biologists who study\nphenotypes, they simply assume that some genetic differences\namong individuals have the potential to cause differences in phe-\nnotypic development an assumption universally accepted in biol-\nogy.\nA naive reader of Lifelines would never guess that sociobiolo-\ngists have responded fully and often to the genetic determinist ep-\nithet (e.g., Daly & Wilson 1987; Maynard Smith 1997). Rose, how-\never, regularly repeats shopworn charges without letting his\nreaders know that the accused have had something to say about\nthese accusations. For example, he repeats Gould and Lewontin\u2019s\nold canards that sociobiologists believe that (1) natural selection is\nthe only process affecting evolution, (2) every trait is an adapta-\ntion, and (3) every half-baked speculation about the possible adap-\ntive value of a given trait is true. He does not mention a single re-\nbuttal (for starters, see Borgia 1994; Endler 1986). And he\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 885\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n886 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nindulges in Gould and Lewontin\u2019s penchant for aggressive\nridicule, producing an unnamed adaptationist who supposedly has\nsaid that the pink legs of flamingos provide adaptive camouflage\nfor the birds when flying at sunset.\nWhat Richard Alexander had to say about Gould and Lewon-\ntin\u2019s use of the \u201cjust-so story\u201d applies with equal strength here.\nThose . . . who parade the worst examples of argument and investiga-\ntion with the apparent purpose of making all efforts at human self-\nanalysis seem silly and trivial, I see as dangerously close to being ideo-\nlogues at least as worrisome as those they malign. I cannot avoid the\nimpression that their purpose is not to enlighten but to play upon the\nuneasiness of those for whom the approach of evolutionary biology is\nalien and disquieting. (Alexander 1987)\nThat Rose has little interest in enlightened debate is apparent\non most pages of the book. For example, his dismissive treatment\nof heritability studies of humans is based largely on ridicule and\ndated criticism, such as the notion that separated twins are prob-\nably placed in similar environments. His readers never learn that\nbehavioral geneticists replied to this methodological criticism long\nago (e.g., Bouchard 1983).\nHaving trashed behavioral genetics and sociobiology, what does\nRose put in their place? In 1984, it was dialectical biology. In 1998,\nwe are offered homeodynamism and autopoiesis, two impressive\nexamples of obfuscatory jargon apparently intended to demon-\nstrate that development is a very complex process indeed. When\nRose says, \u201cit is in the nature of living systems to be radically in-\ndeterminate,\u201d he means that we still do not know exactly how de-\nvelopment occurs. He embraces our current (and presumably\ntemporary) ignorance about some elements of proximate causal-\nity as evidence that we truly have the unbridled capacity to con-\ntrol our destiny.\nAlthough a \u201cphilosophy\u201d of this sort may appeal to those with\nNew Age sensibilities, other readers will note that Rose avoids\neven one detailed scientific test of an autopoietic hypothesis\nmatched against a sociobiological alternative. Were he to have at-\ntempted such a test, Rose might have seen that proximate, devel-\nopmental hypotheses cannot substitute for those concerned with\nthe ultimate, evolutionary causes of behavior. This would have\nbeen a useful lesson to convey to his readers, but instead Rose rails\nagainst a mythical genetic determinism because he finds it easier\nto debate a strawman than a sociobiologist.\nThe science of life as seen through \nRose-coloured glasses\nMike Anderson\nDepartment of Psychology, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands,\nPerth, Western Australia 6907. mike@psy.uwa.edu.au\nAbstract: This commentary takes issue with two of Rose\u2019s central themes\nfrom the perspective of the psychology of intelligence. In the case of re-\nductionism, I argue that Rose fails to live up to his own rhetoric by claim-\ning a veto from his own discipline (biology) over facts of the matter in an-\nother (psychology). In the case of \u201cLifelines,\u201d Rose\u2019s argument is\ncontradicted by evidence from both individual differences and develop-\nmental change in intelligence.\nSteven Rose is grappling with issues in biology that have long been\na concern in psychology. My review will focus on two of them \u2013\nreductionism, and the necessity for a developmental perspective\n(lifelines) for an adequate biological or behavioural science \u2013 to\nshow how palpably the book fails to live up to its own rhetoric.\nReductionism. I can agree with Rose that the excitement of de-\nvelopments in molecular biology does on occasion threaten to\noverwhelm us with arrant and simplistic nonsense \u2013 his example\nof statements about \u201cgenes for homelessness\u201d is sufficient to make\nthis point. Yet, while arguing that scientific understanding of com-\nplex phenomena can involve a number of different levels of de-\nscription and while presenting a conventional taxonomy of these\nlevels on page 9, at the bottom of the very same page Rose asserts\nthat \u201csome properties of living systems are not quantifiable, and\nattempts to put numbers on them produce only mystification (as,\nfor instance, with attempts to score intelligence or aggression).\u201d\nWhether intelligence is quantifiable or not depends on whether\nwe have a theory that allows for the quantification of its constructs.\nThe arbiter of the possibility of quantification is a psychological\ntheory, because intelligence is a psychological construct and is not\nsomething that a biologist can decide by fiat. Again on page 69\n(during an embarrassing attempt to save his research program\nfrom the logic of his own position), we are told that despite the\ncomplexity of life the scientific method is at least capable of falsi-\nfying some hypotheses, among them that \u201cthe Earth is flat, the\nMoon is made of green cheese, or that IQ tests measure some\nfixed, biologically determined feature of an individual.\u201d But ex-\nactly which science has adjudicated this last point? Certainly not\npsychological science, because this is a proposition that is the cen-\ntre of a lively current debate. I can only assume that Rose believes\nthat some biological fact establishes this psychological fact. I\nwould like to know what that fact is. How genes relate to DNA,\nhow DNA controls the synthesis of proteins, how sensitive gene\nexpression is to the environment of the cell, or whatever \u2013 all of\nthis is of no demonstrable significance to whether there is such a\nthing as \u201cgeneral intelligence.\u201d To think otherwise is to be a re-\nductionist.\nLifelines. Rose uses two related arguments to deride the scien-\ntific utility of behaviour genetics. The first is the necessity of a de-\nvelopmental perspective (I have no problem with this) and the\nsecond is the indivisibility of the effects of nature and nurture at\nthe level of an individual lifeline. The second is supposed to be a\nconsequence of the first, but I believe it is a red herring. Rose ar-\ngues that each individual organism can be understood only in\nterms of its own developmental history. But what science would\never attempt such a thing? Taken to its extreme, science seen\nthrough Rose-coloured glasses is the science of Freddo the Frog,\nand Freda the Frog, and son of Freddo, and so on to near infinity.\nIn psychology it has long been recognized that there is indeed a\ntension between nomothetic and idiographic approaches (the first\nis the search for general laws of psychology and the second is the\nattempt to understand the functioning of specific individuals). A\ncomplete psychological science must surely accommodate both\n(see Smith & Tsimpli 1995 for just such an attempt in the case of\nan analysis of the abilities of a linguistic savant set against the back-\nground of general theories of intelligence). Seen in this light, be-\nhaviour genetics (in the nomothetic tradition) is but one method\nof determining the general phenomena that a psychological the-\nory must accommodate \u2013 in this case whether a theory of intelli-\ngence needs to take into account the fact that differences and de-\nvelopmental changes in intelligence are influenced by genetic\ndifferences. Estimating heritabilities is just the behaviour geneti-\ncist\u2019s specialized method for estimating what in the truly experi-\nmental sciences is called \u201ceffect size.\u201d The basic scientific logic is\nthe same: Do genetic differences (the \u201cexperimental\u201d variable)\ncontribute to measured differences in intellectual performance?\nThis is not a silly or misguided question, and all who make serious\nattempts to answer it know that it is nonsensical to think we can\nsubsequently calculate what proportion of individuals\u2019 intelli-\ngence is due to their genes and how much is due to their environ-\nment. So this critique is a red herring and perhaps represents pos-\nturing on Rose\u2019s part, because the answer to this sensible question\nmilitates against his own reductionist and a priori position. For de-\nspite the myriad potential interactions between DNA, RNA,\n\u201cgenes,\u201d processes of embryogenesis, cellular and extracellular en-\nvironments (and whatever else), it turns out that identical twins\nreared apart are so alike in intellectual performance that measur-\ning two identical twins is just about indistinguishable from mea-\nsuring the same twin twice. So much, then, for lifelines. Not be-\ning a reductionist, I see no conflict between what Rose claims is\ntrue for studying the biology of organisms, that is, the hegemony\nof individual lifelines, and what appears to be true for studying and\nunderstanding individual differences and changes in intellectual\nperformance.\nFinally, if we take off our Rose-coloured glasses for a moment\nwe might discover some information that is surely of interest for\ntheorists of intelligence. Is it not of some interest, for example, to\ndiscover that early in development there is some similarity be-\ntween adopted children and their nonbiologically related siblings\n(never greater than that shown with their biologically related off-\nspring with whom they have not shared a home), but that this sim-\nilarity falls to the levels of similarity between any two randomly se-\nlected individuals by early adulthood (see Scarr 1992)? Why\nshould this be so? None of this is to say that genetic studies can\nexplain what intelligence is. On the contrary, it will be a psycho-\nlogical theory, not a genetic one, that will do the real explanatory\nwork. But if such a theory can accommodate such data, then it will\nbe all the richer for it.\nA clash of competing metaphors\nMichael Bradie\nDepartment of Philosophy, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green,\nOH 43403. mbradie@bgnet.bgsu.edu\nAbstract: Metaphors have three important functions in scientific dis-\ncourse: heuristic, rhetorical, and epistemic. I argue that, contrary to pre-\nvailing opinion, metaphors are indispensable components of scientific\nmethodology as well as scientific communication. Insofar as the choice of\nmetaphors reflects ideological commitments, all science is ideological.\nThe philosophically vexed question is how to characterize the sense in\nwhich science is not merely ideological.\nThe seventeenth century was the locus of a dispute centered on\nthe question of the proper modes of representation for scientific\nknowledge, a dispute that was to shape what we now call modern\nscience. Following the legacy of the Royal Society in England,\nmetaphors were condemned to play ancillary roles to mathemati-\ncal representations.\nThis view is mistaken (Bradie 1999). Metaphors have three im-\nportant functions in scientific discourse: heuristic, rhetorical, and\nepistemic. In their heuristic capacity, they serve as guides for fur-\nther research and formation. In their rhetorical capacity, they are\nuseful devices for the communication of research and results. Fi-\nnally, they have an epistemic function. Scientific descriptions and\nexplanations are fundamentally metaphorical. Mathematical mod-\nels in biology are representations of the physical interactions of bi-\nological organisms. As such, they are \u201cmetaphorical redescrip-\ntions\u201d of phenomena in mathematical terms (Bradie 1997; Hesse\n1966). With these brief remarks to set the stage, let us turn to an\nanalysis of Rose\u2019s critique of the metaphors of reductionism.\nRose\u2019s book is a critique of an \u201cideology\u201d that he labels \u201cultra-\nDarwinism\u201d and a brief for replacing it with a better vision, a vi-\nsion he calls a \u201chomeodynamic\u201d view of the evolution and devel-\nopment of organisms. This is a clash of competing metaphors.\nWhile I agree with Rose that scientific disputes are not merely ide-\nological conflicts, in light of the framing remarks on the nature of\nmetaphors in science, it may be harder to spell out the nonideo-\nlogical character of science than some may suppose. It should also\nbe noted that I am using the concept \u201cmetaphor\u201d in a stronger\nsense than Rose\u2019s. For him, metaphors are often mere metaphors,\nwhat I have labeled heuristic or rhetorical metaphors. But all sci-\nentific modeling involves unavoidable distortions \u2013 whether one\ncalls them metaphorical redescriptions or not.\nIn Chapter 2, Rose remarks on the \u201cparadox of science\u201d: in try-\ning to provide a \u201ctrue\u201d account, we must filter our understandings\nthrough conceptual frameworks framed by the \u201cexperience and\nexpectations of its practitioners\u201d (p. 24). The deep question is:\nHow should we best view biological phenomena, in terms of enti-\nties or processes? These are, in fact, two deep metaphors which\nshape the kinds of solutions we are prepared to accept for partic-\nular problems (p. 42).\nRose cautions about the \u201cseductive trio\u201d of metaphor, analogy,\nand homology. When we use mere metaphors as analogies or ho-\nmologies (such as when we say that the brain is a computer), or\nwhen we use analogies as homologies (as in treating animal con-\nflict as homologous to human aggression), then we \u201cdelude our-\nselves\u201d (p. 68). The metaphors and analogies we find \u201cattractive\u201d\nare not based in the \u201cscience,\u201d but are ideologically based (p. 69).\nThe bottom line: science is ideologically based, but it is not just\none ideology among others. There are, Rose claims, \u201creality\nchecks.\u201d But how are we to characterize these checks? Rose here\nfinds himself in the familiar position of someone who wants to ac-\nknowledge the ideological source of our representational schemas\nwithout slipping down the slope into epistemological anarchy.\nThere are many examples of the use of metaphors of varying\nprobity in Rose\u2019s book but limitations of space preclude a discus-\nsion of them here. The fact is that scientific discourse is rife with\nmetaphorical formulations, allusions, insinuations, and applica-\ntions. Rose\u2019s account brings out both the positive and the negative\nfeatures of many metaphors. Rhetorical devices have the power to\ninspire and suggest as well as confuse and obscure. Can we do\nwithout them? Can we somehow abandon our metaphorical mod-\nels of speech and representation and get down to the \u201cplain, un-\nvarnished truth\u201d of things? I suspect not. In promotion, explana-\ntion, and dissemination, metaphors play a central role, and\nprospects for metaphor-free speech and representation is virtually\nnil. To take the easy case first, consider the rhetorical dimension,\nwhich covers the transmission of information among specialists\nand from specialists to the general public. Scientists must be able\nto communicate their programs, techniques, and successes to a\nwide audience. As our collective understanding of the world\nincreases, our individual understanding decreases. The history of\nscience has been the history of increasing specialization. The re-\nsult is that as our cultural understanding of particular features of\nthe world gets deeper, scientists have difficulty communicating\ntheir technically coached results effectively to wider audiences, let\nalone understanding disciplines other than their own.\nEven so, if my argument is correct, scientific theories and their\napplications are fundamentally metaphorical (hence, ideological)\nin character. The \u201csins\u201d of the reductionist ideology (such as prob-\nlems of agglomeration, spurious localization, etc.) are the un-\navoidable by-product of scientific conceptualization. As soon as\nwe agree that cases can or are to be grouped together, we are en-\ngaged in \u201cideology.\u201d The reductionist might be an extreme case\nbut when we reject reductionism (in favor of Bishop Butler\u2019s dic-\ntum that \u201ceverything is what it is and not another thing\u201d) then we\nswing toward the other extreme where all cases are unique. To go\nall the way in this direction is to forego all possibility of scientific\nunderstanding or of producing any systematic understanding of\nnature. We need to stop somewhere between the two extremes. Is\nthere a natural stopping point? Is there (1) some place \u201cdictated\u201d\nby nature, as it were, or do we inevitably (2) choose places to stop\non the basis of interests and convenience? If the latter, then sci-\nence can never be free from ideology and rather than pretend that\nit is, perhaps we should promote analytical practices that bring to\nthe surface our ineluctable biases.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 887\nWhat the human annals tell us\nGwen J. Broude\nDepartment of Psychology, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604-0152\nbroude@vassar.edu\nAbstract: Evidence reveals numerous cross-cultural universals regarding\nhuman mental processes and behavior. Similarly, cross-cultural data are\nconsistent with predictions from theories of kin selection, reciprocal al-\ntruism, and sexual selection inspired by Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by\nnatural selection. Thus, the \u201cannals of human behaviour\u201d do provide \u201cex-\nample[s] fitting the sociobiological bill,\u201d (Lifelines, p. 202) thereby, sup-\nporting sociobiological accounts of human behavior.\nIn Lifelines, Steven Rose wants to persuade the reader that re-\nductionism \u2013 as a method, but more especially as a theory \u2013 is a\nbankrupt and dangerous paradigm. On Rose\u2019s view, reductionism,\nwith liberal (not guilty) help from wrong-headed ultra-Darwinists,\npoints falsely to the genes, aided by natural selection, as the sole\ndeterminants of the functioning of biological organisms. As foils\nfor his argument, Rose singles out such prominent sociobiologists\nor friends of sociobiologists as Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins,\nand E. O. Wilson, who have tried to account for biological minds\nand behavior in light of selectionist theory. Rose targets, in par-\nticular, sociobiological accounts of kin selection, reciprocal altru-\nism, and sexual selection as examples of the troubled waters into\nwhich unwary biologists, seduced by the reductionist agenda,\nmight find themselves wading. Rose asks whether any examples\nfrom the annals of human behavior might fit the sociobiological\nbill. As a recovering cultural relativist trained in the Franz Boas\nschool of anthropology, I want to take up Rose\u2019s challenge.\nSelectionists predict that we should find psychological and be-\nhavioral uniformity in response to shared opportunities and chal-\nlenges that the world has to offer to our species. So, taking up\nRose\u2019s challenge, are there any such uniformities in human func-\ntioning as described by anthropologists? Here is a list of cultural\nuniversals from the guru of social anthropology, George P. Mur-\ndock (1945): age-grading, athletic sports, bodily adornment, cal-\nendars, cleanliness training, community organization, cooking, co-\noperative labor, cosmology, courtship, dancing, decorative art,\ndivination, division of labor, dream interpretation, education, \neschatology, ethics, ethnobotany, etiquette, faith healing, family\nfeasting, fire making, folklore, food taboos, funeral rites, games,\ngestures, gift giving, government, greetings, hair styles, hospital-\nity, housing, hygiene, incest taboos, inheritance rules, joking, kin\ngroups, kinship nomenclature, language, law, luck superstitions,\nmagic, marriage, mealtimes, medicine, obstetrics, penal sanctions,\npersonal names, population policy, postnatal care, pregnancy us-\nages, property rights, propitiation of supernatural beings, puberty\ncustoms, religious ritual, residence rules, sexual restrictions, soul\nconcepts, status differentiation, surgery, tool-making, trade, visit-\ning, weaving, and weather control. Other observers of human cul-\ntures have proposed other lists which extend the number of uni-\nversals. So anthropologists find uniformity in how human beings\norganize their lives. Cultural relativists tend to focus on local vari-\nations. Some people are monogamous and some are polygynous\nand some are polyandrous, they assert, so we can\u2019t find anything\nshared across cultures. This misses the astonishing fact that, in\nevery known human culture, people stand up in front of their\nneighbors and commit themselves to a culturally sanctioned mate.\nDitto for other efforts to focus on variations on the theme across\ncultures while missing the theme itself.\nWhat about Rose\u2019s target sociobiological theories? Is there any-\nthing in the annals of human behavior that might cause us to view\nkin selection, reciprocal altruism, and sexual selection theory as\nsomething less than bankrupt? Any anthropologist will tell you\nthat the kin group is the basic functional unit of organization\nacross societies. Generations of anthropology students have been\nbored to tears by the endless focus on kin lineages and kin termi-\nnology and kin groups with which anthropology professors regale\nthem. People across cultures depend upon relatives as opposed to\nnon-kin for their domestic, religious, economic and political well-\nbeing. They share resources and cooperate on tasks preferentially\nwith kin and leave their wealth to kin (Broude 1994). Across hu-\nman societies, it sure does look as if nepotism flourishes and blood\nis, indeed, thicker than water.\nEthnographic descriptions also indicate that human beings con-\nduct their interpersonal relationships in ways that are consistent\nwith reciprocal altruism theory. Patterned exchange among\nnonkin is endemic across cultures. Friendships, voluntary associ-\nations, and cooperative work groups of all sorts, in which mutual\naid and support are expected, are found everywhere. Anecdotes\nare endemic in the ethnographic literature in which the failure to\nreciprocate a gift given or a favor done is met with indignation and\nthinly veiled hints or threats (Broude 1994). The husband-wife re-\nlationship, itself a cultural universal, is a compact between unre-\nlated individuals in which each contributes to the welfare of the\nother and of the offspring of both. Even in cultures that are in-\nvoked as examples of the altruistic ethic, we find expectations of\nreciprocity lurking below. Among the Kalahari !Kung, for exam-\nple, people give away their possessions freely, and the !Kung are\nfrequently hauled out as an example of a communitarian society.\nBut while gift-giving is universal among the !Kung, so is gift-\nreceiving. Moreover, exchanges tend to take place among a small\nnumber of partners, who may even be inherited and each of whom\nkeeps a running tab of who has given what to whom and when\n(Shostak 1981).\nTheories operating under the umbrella of sexual selection also\nlive comfortably with the ethnographic data. We see sexual selec-\ntion played out, for instance, in the almost universal double stan-\ndard regarding extramarital sex in which women\u2019s sexual infideli-\nties are viewed as more serious than those of men, as sexual\nselection theory would predict. Thus, in one cross-cultural survey,\nwomen were permitted to engage in extramarital sex in only 11.2%\nof 116 traditional cultures around the world, while extramarital sex\nnorms were more permissive for men than for women in 77.7% of\nthese cultures. Even when extramarital sex is condemned for both\nspouses, punishments for infringements of these norms are typi-\ncally considerably more severe, and often dramatically so, for\nwives. And where extramarital sex norms for wives are permissive,\nthe husband is likely to receive a benefit. For example, among the\nLesu of New Ireland, a wife who engages in sexual relations out-\nside her marriage receives a gift from her lover, which she then\nhands over to her husband (Broude 1994).\nRose argues that biological organisms, including human beings,\nconstruct their own futures. Gene-mediated selectionist theory on\nhis view perverts this fact of life. What salvages it? Interactionism.\nWe all say that we are interactionists, observes Rose. But some of\nus, on Rose\u2019s view, are more interactionist than others. Rose is a\ngood interactionist. Sociobiologists, he claims, are not.\nInteractionists recognize that the behavior and development of\nbiological organisms are the joint product of biology and environ-\nment. But, then, selectionist theory is deeply interactionist. Who\ntakes the cooperation of biology and environment in producing\nlifelines more seriously than a selectionist? I am interested in\nhearing how Rose reconciles evidence of human universals from\nthe human annals with an interactionist theory that does not make\nroom for selectionist thinking.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n888 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nNo short cuts to science\nBruce G. Charlton\nDepartment of Psychology, university of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle\nNE1 7RU, United Kingdom. bruce.charlton@ncl.ac.uk\nAbstract: Steven Rose regards oversimplification of biology as the\nsupreme sin, inevitably leading to evil consequences, and requiring an\nunique distortion of scientific practice to avoid it. To avoid this, he pro-\nposes a short-cut to scientific knowledge by defining certain areas of biol-\nogy that are intrinsically flawed. But this achieves only a subordination of\nscience to politics. There are no general-purpose shortcuts for evaluating\nthe validity of theories, and no substitutes for testing specific theories us-\ning relevant evidence.\nSteven Rose is against \u201creductionism\u201d in science. For his major ex-\nample, he invents a theoretical framework termed \u201cultra-Darwin-\nism\u201d and characterized by intellectual bankruptcy and moral de-\npravity. The insistent refrain of Lifelines is: \u201cthings are more\ncomplex than that.\u201d\nBut this is not enough, because in science things are always\nmore complex than that \u2013 science is a search for simplified, uni-\nfying theories. The proper question is whether or not the simpli-\nfication is useful, whether or not the simple model works as a the-\nory, whether its consequences are consistent with the test of\nfurther observations.\nHence it is clear that what Rose objects to is inappropriate sim-\nplification, rather than simplification per se. But inappropriate\nsimplification is merely a type of bad science \u2013 simplification is in-\nappropriate when it does not work. So, Rose is against bad science.\nNothing controversial about that. The problem then becomes:\nhow can we tell bad science from good? How can we tell over-\nsimplification from the right amount of simplification?\nTo paraphrase Einstein: theories should be as simple as possi-\nble, but no simpler. In other words, we should simplify as much as\npossible (because simple models are more rigorously testable and\nmore useful), but we will know that a scientific theory is oversim-\nplified when its consequences are inconsistent with structured ob-\nservation. An oversimplified theory will not be predictive, because\nit has missed out important variables. Simplification is bad only\nwhen it does not work. In opposing oversimplification, however,\nRose conflates the pragmatic and the ethical. For Rose, oversim-\nplification in biology is evidence of moral depravity. He does not\naccept that any wickedness due to oversimplification is accidental;\nhe is trying to argue for a special logical link such that oversimpli-\nfication inevitably leads to evil consequences. Implicitly, he sees\noversimplification as the supreme sin, requiring an unique distor-\ntion of scientific practice to avoid it.\nRose is transfixed by a specific ethical danger: that biological\ntheories about human being may be oversimplified and that such\noversimplified biological theories are more likely to be misinter-\npreted, misapplied, and used to justify moral harm than are any\nother sorts of theory. With this in mind, throughout Lifelines Rose\nis trying to find a formula by which we might know in advance of\ntesting whether a biological theory is oversimplified. The idea is\nthat theories and scientists grouped under the ultra-Darwinist\numbrella will be condemned a priori. It seems to me that Rose\nwants to do this in order that the general public (who lack specific\nscientific knowledge) can prevent themselves from being hood-\nwinked by repressive political propaganda, probably right-wing,\nthat is masquerading as science.\nIn trying to rule out this particular source of harm, Rose has im-\nplicitly set himself the task of constructing a general-purpose short-\ncut to measuring the truth of scientific theories \u2013 to know whether\na theory is valid or vapid without having to go through all the hard\nwork of reading, understanding, observing, and experimenting. In\nother words, Rose is seeking a shortcut to scientific knowledge.\nIf I am right about the fundamentally ethical drive behind the\nwriting of Lifelines, this would explain why Rose hardly seems to\nhave read about, let alone made the intellectual effort to under-\nstand, the major work in evolutionary biology over the past 20\nyears. Yet this has been a period of remarkable progress during\nwhich the theory and practice of evolutionary biology had been\ntransformed. A few of these major advances are name-checked;\nbut never explicated, engaged with, or refuted. Throughout Life-\nlines, Rose fails to confront the best and most recent scientific\nwork and attacks obviously inferior studies, garbled media reports\nof research, or old papers from the 1960s and 1970s that have of-\nten (as is the way for most science) since been revised or super-\nseded. This is merely shooting fish in a barrel.\nMistakes may be forgiven in a book of this scope. But some are\nevidence of a failure to do the elementary homework necessary for\na person who is purporting to critique and redirect evolutionary\nbiology. For example, on page 227 Rose writes \u201cto cling to \u2018the\ngene\u2019 as the sole unit and level of selection under these circum-\nstances, as Maynard Smith and the ultra-Darwinists do, seems\nperverse.\u201d Well, it happens to be the case that Maynard Smith is\nco-author of a book (Maynard Smith & Szathmary 1995) called\nThe major transitions in evolution (which was also published as an\nessay in Nature; Szathmary & Maynard Smith 1995) \u2013 a major\nwork on exactly the topic of the many units and levels of selection\nthat Maynard Smith is supposed to have perversely ignored. May-\nnard Smith\u2019s book forms part of a significant branch of mainstream\nevolutionary biology that includes important work by David L.\nHull, Richard Dawkins, and some others who are elsewhere cat-\negorized in Lifelines as being among the single-gene-obsessed-\nultra-Darwinists. Perhaps Rose does not know this work or un-\nderstand its implications \u2013 or perhaps he knows but has excluded\nit. Whatever the explanation, this line of evolutionary research tor-\npedoes Rose\u2019s major argument. Scientists like Maynard Smith\nhave already achieved a level of understanding of multi-level se-\nlection and interaction far beyond that called for in Lifelines.\nEvolutionary biology is a science like any other, if it is allowed\nto be. It should not be treated as a special case. Blending ethical\nand social criticism with science, as Rose does, is a recipe for dis-\nhonesty and double standards. He has subordinated human biol-\nogy to politics, and is mainly concerned to fit human biological\nknowledge into a pre-existing agenda of what is acceptable.\nBy contrast, I would argue that biology is oversimplified only\nwhen it is untrue; and not because simple theories are uniquely\nsusceptible to misapplication. An oversimplification of human na-\nture might be used to justify repression; but then again, tortured\ncasuistic logic or a denial of human nature can be used to justify\nrepression with equal facility. Hence, \u201creductionism\u201d and \u201cultra-\nDarwinism\u201d are merely boo-words, and are irrelevant to the\nproper practice of science. The validity of a specific theory can only\nbe determined by the laborious work of evaluating its conse-\nquences on the basis of specific relevant evidence. There are no\nshort cuts to science, and no substitutes for substantive knowledge.\nMetabolic complexity has no bearing \non genetic determinism\nAthel Cornish-Bowden\nInstitut F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif Biologie Structurale et Microbiologie, Laboratoire de Chimie\nBact\u00e9rienne, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 13402 Marseilles\nCedex 20, France. athel@ibsm.cnrs-mrs.fr\nir2lcb.cnrs-mrs.fr\/~athel\/homepage.htm\nAbstract: Metabolic systems are complicated and contain very large num-\nbers of interacting reactions and many internal regulatory mechanisms.\nThis does not prevent the genetic composition of an organism from influ-\nencing its behavior, however, nor does it preclude the possibility that some\naspects of its behavior may be amenable to simple explanations.\nIn 1774, Leonhard Euler claimed at the court of Catherine the\nGreat that he could prove the existence of God, silencing his op-\nponent, Denis Diderot, with the following challenge: \u201cSir, (a 1 bn)\/\nn 5 x, hence God exists; reply\u201d (quoted by Singh 1998). Like\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 889\nDiderot, Rose finds algebra hard to follow (p. 160) and might find\nit just as difficult to recognize the irrelevance of Euler\u2019s argument\nto the proposition it was supposed to prove. Rose\u2019s own style of\ndiscussion is similar, however, apparently in the hope that his read-\ners will be sufficiently ignorant of biochemistry to think that his\nemphasis on its complexity has some bearing on the question of\nwhether genes influence behavior.\nBooks that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do\ndescribe observations of behavior on almost every page. The\nbooks of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special tar-\nget, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of the author\u2019s inter-\npretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual infor-\nmation that these books contain. How can one hope to convince\nanyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abun-\ndant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in\nRose\u2019s book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other\nbiologists\u2019 opinions, but almost no observations from behavioral\nbiology. Nonetheless, in his preface (p. x) he aligns himself with\nthe practising biologists \u201cwho spend a significant part of every\nworking day thinking about and designing experiments,\u201d dismiss-\ning Dawkins and Dennett as \u201cpeople who either no longer do sci-\nence or never did it.\u201d What a pity, therefore, that Rose chose to in-\nclude so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book.\nThere are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and\nthat\u2019s about it.\nRose claims throughout the book to be a biochemist, and in the\nremainder of this review I shall concentrate on the section\n(pp. 158\u201366) that deals with the complexity of metabolic networks\nand underlies the suggestion at the end of the book (p. 307) that\ngenes are just individual workers in the great molecular democ-\nracy of the cell. As this section occurs in a chapter with the same\ntitle as the book, it is fair to regard it as the core of the book.\nHowever, even as a standard biochemical account of the basic\nideas of metabolic regulation, divorced from its role in the whole\nthesis, it is peculiar. In a muddled account of enzyme catalysis that\ndoes not contain any algebra, Rose confesses that he finds the al-\ngebraic relationship between a reaction rate and a rate constant\nhard to grasp. He then presents metabolic regulation in terms of\nthe tired old myth of the rate-limiting reaction, saying that in prac-\ntice it often turns out that the rate-limiting step is one of the first\nin the sequence \u2013 obviously advantageous so far as the cellular\neconomy is concerned: Does it \u201cturn out,\u201d or is it assumed with-\nout considering any other possibility? The enzyme phosphofruc-\ntokinase is asserted in innumerable textbooks to be the rate-limit-\ning enzyme for glycolysis. If it were, then overexpressing it would\nincrease the glycolytic flux, but even though the relevant experi-\nments were done in yeast more than a decade ago (Heinisch\n1986), and have since been repeated in other organisms, the re-\nsults \u2013 no detectable increase in glycolytic flux when phospho-\nfructokinase is overexpressed 3.5-fold \u2013 have yet to be taken seri-\nously by the hordes of biotechnologists in search of the mythical\nrate-limiting enzymes.\nRose appears to be conscious that his account is faulty, because\nat the end of it he quotes Kacser and Burns (1979) to the effect\nthat control is shared among all the enzymes of a system. But does\nhe mean the mea culpa that follows? If Kacser and Burns are right,\nthen what was the point in wasting pages on a muddle? If they are\nwrong then why are they being quoted? Presumably the attraction\nof their paper lay more in its title and some quotable sentences\nthan in any serious study of its content.\nIf these pages have any point at all it is to establish that metab-\nolism is complicated, involving very large numbers of interacting\nreactions. True enough, but what does that have to do with the\nidea that genes can affect behavior? A system can be highly com-\nplicated, with many internal regulatory devices, yet its behavior\nmay still be amenable to explanation in terms of a particular set of\nexternal influences: Does anyone doubt that the path taken by an\nairliner is affected by the actions of its pilot, or must one just say\nthat it is a complicated device and the pilot is just one of many\ncomponents in its democratic organization?\nBehavioral neurogenetics \nbeyond determinism\nWim E. Crusio\nInstitut de Transg\u00e9nose, CNRS UPR 9074, G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, Neurog\u00e9n\u00e9tique et\nComportement, 45071 Orl\u00e9ans Cedex 2, France. crusio@cnrs-orleans.fr\nAbstract: Rose\u2019s Lifelines justifiably attacks the rigid genetic determinism\nthat pervades the popular press and even some scientific writing. Genes\ndo not equate with destiny. However, Rose\u2019s argument should not be taken\ntoo far: genes do influence behavior, in animals as well as in man.\nLet us start with my conclusion: Lifelines by Steven Rose should\nbe required reading for every biologist, especially those working\nin behavioral and neural genetics. Rose presents a meticulously ar-\ngued case against the deterministic, reductionist mode of thinking\nthat pervades much of modern biology. However, much as I find\nmyself in agreement with many of Rose\u2019s starting points and con-\nclusions, I disagree with many of his arguments that lead from the\none to the other. In addition, Rose weakens his arguments by fre-\nquently inserting politically inspired barbs (against Thatcherism,\nor the privatization of utilities in the United Kingdom, for exam-\nple).1 This is unfortunate, because in my experience this allows\npeople to brush aside his otherwise valid scientific arguments,\nwith the brief observation that Rose is ideologically biased.\nThe first chapters of the book offer excellent reading and, al-\nthough a few strained arguments will occasionally be encoun-\ntered, it is mainly the last few chapters, where Rose discusses be-\nhavioral and neural genetics, that I find myself most in\ndisagreement with him. For instance, on page 190 Rose argues\nthat heritability estimates can be valuable for an animal or plant\nbreeder interested in crop yield or milk yield in cows, but not\nwhen applied to human behavior. In principle, I agree with this\nobservation (Crusio 1990), but I disagree with Rose\u2019s way of ar-\nriving at this conclusion. His argument is that milk yield is a phe-\nnotype that is more straightforward to measure than intelligence,\nreligiosity, or other such characters. This reminds one of the con-\ntention that IQ, because it is a complex character, is a soup, and\nthat whereas genetic analysis of its components, such as the size\nof tomatoes and the weight of potatoes is reasonable, analyzing\nsoup is not (Roubertoux & Capron 1990). But is such a deceptively\nsimple measure as milk yield not also a \u201csoup\u201d? Milk yield is, in\nfact, a complex character, the sum of many different \u201csubcharac-\nters\u201d such as fat content, chemical composition, water content,\nand so on. If Rose finds that heritability estimates of milk yield can\nbe done, then it follows that such estimates are also possible for\nIQ in human beings, at least in principle. The point he misses is\nthat the sole utility of a heritability estimate lies in the fact that it\npredicts the response to selection of the character in question\n(Crusio 1999), something nobody in his right mind would envision\nfor IQ or religiosity in human beings, I hope.\nThe picture that Rose paints of behavior genetics is quite a car-\nicature. It seems almost as if he wants to argue that genes and be-\nhavior have nothing to do with one another and that if genes do\ninfluence behavior, then they only do so in animals and surely not\nin man. In his efforts to show this, Rose sometimes misrepresents\nthe things said by others, for instance, when he discusses the work\nof Cases et al. (1995) on aggressive behavior in a mouse mutant\nlacking monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) activity: Rose first de-\nscribes a test used by some to measure aggression in rats: mouse\nkilling behavior. Of course, whether killing a mouse that belongs\nto a totally different species is a good measure of the aggressive\ntendencies of a rat is debatable. But Cases et al. were studying ag-\ngression of male mice vis-\u00e0-vis conspecifics, a completely differ-\nent situation. Rose then continues to say that \u201cthis behaviour in\nthe rat is transmogrified into an analogue of the aggression shown\nby drive-by gangs shooting up a district in Los Angeles, as in the\nconcluding sentences to the paper by Cases\u201d (p. 294). Again, we\nhave a groundless (and needless!) accusation. At no point in the\nCases paper are gang shootings or even distantly similar events\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n890 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nmentioned. All Cases et al. (1995, p. 1766) are saying is that the\nresults obtained with their mice support the notion that the be-\nhavioral problems described in males from a Dutch kindred\n(Brunner et al. 1993) are due to their MAOA deficiency and not\nto \u201cunusual genetic background or complex psychosocial stres-\nsors.\u201d This conclusion seems to me completely warranted by the\ndata. Still, as I have argued before (Crusio 1996), although the\nknock-out mice may be a good model for the problems encoun-\ntered in the Dutch kindred, it is debatable whether these troubles\nare adequately described by the word \u201caggression.\u201d In addition, it\nis becoming increasingly clear that the MAOA deficiency is a very\nrare mutation, so far described only for this single Dutch family\n(Stamps & Gurling 1998). So once again I find myself in agree-\nment with Rose, namely, that the MAOA mutation does not ex-\nplain most (or even any) of the everyday violence that we observe\nin the streets \u2013 without agreeing with the arguments he uses to ar-\nrive at this conclusion.\nIn fact, both my agreement and my disagreement with Rose can\nbe illustrated by studying a small experiment more closely: a com-\nparison of aggressive behavior in two inbred mouse strains, NZB\nand CBA\/H. The behavioral test is a situation in which some stan-\ndard opponent (a male mouse from a non-attacking strain) is in-\ntroduced into the cage of the animal to be tested. The behavioral\nmeasure is simply whether or not an attack occurs. Of course, this\ntest situation is very simplified compared to natural situations, but\nnot more so than the learning tests that Rose deems acceptable\nfor his chicks. In this testing situation, about 80% of males from\nthe NZB strain attack, as opposed to about 30% of CBA\/H mice.\nIn a series of careful experiments, Roubertoux, Carlier, and col-\nleagues (Carlier et al. 1991; Roubertoux et al. 1994) have shown\nthat apart from some important effects of the (maternal) environ-\nment, this strain difference is owing to genetic differences be-\ntween these strains. The results warrant two conclusions. First,\ngenes can influence behavior, even a complex one like attacking a\nstrange conspecific. However, this experiment also tells us another\nimportant fact: although all animals within a strain are highly sim-\nilar genetically, about 20% of the supposedly aggressive NZB mice\ndo not attack, whereas about 30% of the non-attacking strain\nCBA\/H do. In short, even under the controlled conditions of a\nsimplified laboratory test, where all environmental conditions are\nstandardized as much as possible, genes do not determine behav-\nior in a rigid fashion. Apparently, mice have a \u201cchoice.\u201d And if this\ngoes for mice, then I agree with Rose that it will not be different\nfor human beings.\nRose is right in attacking the deterministic notion found so of-\nten in the popular press (and even in scientific writings) to the ef-\nfect that genes equal destiny. This is an important and valuable\nmessage. However, we should take care not to let the pendulum\nswing too far by denying any influence of genes on behavior. It is\nthe task of behavioral neurogeneticists to find the correct balance\nbetween these opposing views.\nNOTE\n1. Some of these barbs degenerate into inadmissible ad hominem at-\ntacks. A glaring example of this can be found in note 17 on pp. 206\u2013207.\nRose asserts that many of T. J. Bouchard\u2019s articles appeared in \u201cActa ge-\nnetica gemellologica\u201d (sic: the correct title of the journal is Acta geneticae\nmedicae et gemellologiae), a \u201csomewhat obscure journal . . . or in volumes\nof conference proceedings, rather than in refereed journals.\u201d Of course, it\nis evidence and arguments that matter, not the place where they have been\npublished. Not only does such a nasty attack distract from Rose\u2019s main ar-\nguments; the accusation is also wrong. A Medline search renders 42 arti-\ncles for \u201cBouchard TJ,\u201d of which 40 are on twins. These 40 articles were\npublished in 30 different journals. Three articles (plus a news item) ap-\npeared in Science, one in Nature. Only two articles are actually published\nin the Acta. I expect and demand that Dr. Rose offer his apologies to Dr.\nBouchard.\nStability of behavioral traits within \nthe framework of neural plasticity\nRichard A. Depue\nLaboratory of Neurobiology of Temperament and Personality, Cornell\nUniversity, Ithaca, NY 14853. rad5@cornell.edu\nAbstract: Lifelines supports the theme that behavioral development is a\nfluid, life-long phenomenon. In contrast, many emotional and cognitive\ntraits are subject to strong genetic influence, and are highly stable over\nmany years. The manner in which neuroplasticity and trait stability co-\noccur needs to be modeled. An outline of such a model is provided to pro-\nmote discussion of this complex issue.\nRose elegantly supports the theme emerging in many life and be-\nhavioral sciences that development is a life-long phenomenon\ncharacterized by the ability of the organism to reorganize and\nchange in the face of changing environments. In contrast to this\ntheme is the fact that many emotional personality traits are sub-\nject to strong genetic influence (Bouchard 1994; Tellegen et al.\n1988), and are highly stable (in terms of an individual\u2019s rank order)\nover as many as 20 years (Costa & McCrae 1994). Furthermore,\ntwin studies have shown that the stable component of positive\nemotional levels itself has a heritability that approaches 80%, and\nthat stress-induced variation in positive emotional levels are tem-\nporally quite limited, returning to pre-stress trait levels as if a he-\ndonic set-point influence were operative (Lykken & Tellegen\n1996). The same finding occurs with respect to some forms of cog-\nnition: IQ levels (which can be thought of as a cognitive trait\nmarker) of identical twins reared apart show equally high heri-\ntability as those for identical twins reared together (Bouchard\n1997), and IQ is relatively stable after adolescence.\nClearly, the development of cognitive abilities and intelligence,\nas well as emotional behavior, must be dependent on powerful ex-\nperience-dependent neuroplasticity processes. And just as clearly,\nmore intense environmental conditions can effect major changes\nin behavior. Extremely stressful conditions, or stressors occurring\nduring early stages of development, may cause long-term modifi-\ncations of neurotransmitter and\/or neuropeptide functioning that\ncan be accompanied by \u201cpersonality\u201d changes (Le Moal & Simon\n1991; Yehuda & McFarlane 1997). Similarly, animal work indi-\ncates that transitions in hedonic set point may occur under certain\nconditions (Ahmed & Koob 1998). But, within the normal range\nof environmental circumstances, temporal stability of behavioral\ntraits is often observed. The manner in which neuroplasticity and\ntrait stability co-occur needs to be modeled, but Lifelines provides\nno clear guidelines for this problem. I offer the following possi-\nbilities on which Rose\u2019s thoughts would be valuable.\nSpecifically at issue is the manner in which individual differ-\nences in emotional personality and some cognitive traits become\nstabilized. To be clear, let me define personality traits, like extra-\nversion, anxiety, and fear, as emotional systems that have evolved\nto increase our adaptation to critical stimuli in the environment,\nsuch as rewards, uncertainty, and aversive stimuli, respectively. I\nand others (Gray 1992) assume that individual differences in the\nneurobiological sensitivity (or reactivity) to these critical stimuli\nunderlie phenotypic variation in the traits. Moreover, the neural\nfoundation of these emotional systems involves networks of brain\nregions that interact to emotionally evaluate and respond to envi-\nronmental stimuli (LeDoux 1992). It seems likely that individual\nvariation in the neurobiological sensitivity to critical stimuli is due,\nnot to structural variation in brain regions that comprise the net-\nwork associated with an emotion system, but rather to variation in\nthe functional properties of neurotransmitters\/neuromodulators\nthat modulate the functional processes of the network.\nA large body of animal research suggests that behavioral stabil-\nity may occur within a plastic neural environment via a sequence\nof factors (Depue & Collins 1999).\n1. Genetic factors can strongly influence a biological variable\nthat plays a central role in a trait\u2019s phenotype, such as a neuro-\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 891\ntransmitter that strongly modulates a network\u2019s functioning. For\ninstance, genetic effects on the number of midbrain neurons of\ntransmitters of wide distribution (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) have\nbeen demonstrated to markedly and stably influence trait levels of\nemotionally-relevant behaviors in animals. This factor can be\nviewed as the lowest-order foundation of the concept of trait.\n2. Significantly, this biological foundation may strongly modu-\nlate the impact of the environment on experience-dependent pro-\ncesses. To extend our example, the genetically-influenced number\nof transmitter-synthesizing neurons may influence the mean\nrange of magnitude of critical stimuli that can (i) activate neuro-\ntransmitter projections sufficiently strongly to (ii) generate their\neffects on neural and behavioral processes. With an increasing\nnumber of neurons, the range of magnitude of effective stimuli\nthat can activate emotional behavior is increased into the weaker\nextreme of the range. Animal research strongly supports the op-\neration of this factor.\n3. The product of this positive genotype 3 stimulus-efficacy in-\nteraction, which may be reflected in the synaptic density within\nthe trait\u2019s neural network, may begin to develop during early post-\nnatal life, and may represent a relatively stable psychobiological\nfoundation that mediates the influence of trait-salient contexts\nover emotional processes. This psychobiological foundation serves\nas the background upon which future experience-dependent pro-\ncesses may act, and may be seen as the basis of temperament.\n4. Stability of this psychobiological foundation or temperament\nlevel is assumed to be maintained over time by at least two factors:\n(a) the psychobiological foundation of the temperamental trait has\nnow established the mean range of effective critical stimuli more\nstrongly, thereby further influencing the extent to which the envi-\nronment has \u201caccess\u201d to experience-dependent neuroplastic pro-\ncesses. At later stages of development, one can presume that the\noperation of an active genetotype 3 critical environment interac-\ntion will play an important role in maintaining initial differences.\nBut most importantly, (b) individual differences in neurotrans-\nmitter functioning (e.g., due to variation in neuron number) may\nstrongly influence the experience-dependent neuroplastic pro-\ncesses themselves, thereby influencing the extent to which critical\nstimuli gain control of and facilitate emotional processes.\nBy way of example, this model may be applied to the personal-\nity trait of extraversion (Depue & Collins 1999), which has strong\ngenetic influence and is stable over many years and life stressors\n(Lykken & Tellegen 1996; McGue et al. 1993; Tellegen et al. 1988).\nGenetic variation in the number of dopamine neurons in the mid-\nbrain is reflected in very stable variation in extraversion-relevant\nbehavior in animals. Moreover, dopamine is critical to the devel-\nopment of control of rewarding contexts over behavior through its\nmodulation of heterosynaptic plasticity: dopamine facilitates the\nconnection of efferents from brain regions carrying the salient con-\ntext of reward to brain regions involved in integrating extraverted\nbehavior. And, most importantly, individual differences in\ndopamine functioning in animals correlate with the degree to\nwhich the environment gains control over extraverted behavior.\nThus, the important point concerning stability is this: because\nanimal research indicates that neurotransmitter functioning can\nplay an integral part in (a) determining the range of effective crit-\nical stimuli that have access to an emotional system, and (b) the\nextent to which those stimuli gain influence over behavior, indi-\nvidual differences in neurotransmitter functioning may modulate\nboth of these processes and, hence, the extent to which trait-\nsalient contexts facilitate emotional processes. In this way, early\nexperiential processes may lay the foundation for trends in emo-\ntional behavior by moderating the strength of later experience-\ndependent processes involving the functional capacities of a sig-\nnificant neurotransmitter projection system (Collins & Depue\n1992). Therefore, across the lifespan, individual differences in\nneurotransmitter functioning may modulate synaptic arborization\nwithin network circuitry associated with an emotional system,\nwhich in turn would modulate responsivity to critical stimuli and\nbe manifested in stable variation in emotional expression.\nMultidetermination\nJudith Economos\nRadio Computing Services, White Plains, NY 10701. judith@rcsworks.com\nAbstract: Professor Rose is inflamed against the views of Richard\nDawkins concerning genetic determinism. He has constructed an image\nof a much stupider and eviller Dawkins view than is likely to be true and\nargues against it. This is unrewarding, but otherwise his discussion of bi-\nology is very interesting.\nSteven Rose is writing against reductionism, gene determinism,\nand Richard Dawkins, whose Selfish gene (1976) was, for me, a\nrevelation in its day. He is offended by Dawkins\u2019s way of looking\nat biology, which he sees as a crude and oversimplified view of or-\nganisms. There would be nothing wrong with this if he simply en-\ngaged in open combat with Dawkins\u2019s cheerful geneticism. But he\nseems vehement. A danger of vehemence is a tendency to misde-\nscribe the opposition. In the Preface Rose tars the opposition with\nNazism, eugenics, racism, anti-Semitism, elitism, and sexism.\nWhen a scholar and a gentleman is seen doing something as un-\nscholarly and ungentlemanly as poisoning the well, it is embar-\nrassing. No, let me explain: It was more than embarrassing. It\nmade me so angry I nearly refused to read the book at all. That\nwould have been a pity, because it is otherwise an informative and\nwell-written book\nRose blames this crude biology on reductionism and determin-\nism. Fortunately he does not take on the whole problem, but only\nasserts that organisms are not genetically determined. He pro-\nposes to demolish \u201cradical\u201d reductionism. Reductionism is the\nview that every phenomenon can, in principle, be explained using\nonly terms and laws of physics: no irreducibly novel stuff or laws\nneed be introduced.\nRose concentrates on trying to break the chain at the reduction\nof behavior to genetics. Everyone knows behavior is sensibly de-\nscribed and explained only in intentional, teleological, functional,\nand instrumental terms. Even so, if you deny the theoretical pos-\nsibility of (someday, somehow) reducing those terms (by stages) to\npurely physical terms your alternatives are:\n1. asserting that the behavior of living things is supernatural\n(owing to immaterial forces);\n2. denying that there are any laws that govern organism be-\nhavior; and\n3. asserting that new primitive terms must be added to the ones\nabout quarks and mesons and whatnot, and new primitive laws\nadded to the ones about strong and weak forces, gravity, and elec-\ntromagnetism. This is emergentism.\nRose is an emergentist. Emergentism is appealing but incoher-\nent. If life is material, then it obeys the laws of matter; if the laws\nof matter have to be augmented with laws of life, then what does\nit mean to say the universe is material? Could you add terms about\nthe Life Force, or souls, to the physical primitives and still call the\nuniverse material?\nRose\u2019s first step in destroying reductionism (as he sees it) is to\nundermine na\u00efve faith in the pure objectivity of \u201cscience.\u201d This is\na healthy corrective to any starry-eyed ideal of science surviving\ninto this decade. Robust skepticism is the basis of science, not its\nbane. Nor does the point have much to do with reductionism.\nHe demonstrates, for those of us who missed the last several\ndecades, that observation is neither direct nor passive but directed\nby the theory that provides its motivation and context, by the in-\nstrumentation that makes it possible, by the ideology of the per-\nson doing the research, and by the underlying metaphors of the\ntime. Again, while none of this is part of ideal science, it is cer-\ntainly part of the human beings who do science. Although we can\nseparate out a lot of personal bias, it is hard, as they say, to prove\na negative; even cross-cultural peer review cannot screen out the\nunknown bias of an age. (Again, it does not have much to do with\nreductionism.)\nRose spends the best part of Lifelines on an account of molec-\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n892 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nular biology, genetics, embryogenesis, and development. This is a\nwonderful review and I recommend it for the teaching of children.\nThere is a lot of fluidity, self-organization, dynamism, process.\nThis is fine and true, except that he seems to believe that reduc-\ntionism cannot handle them; that it can deal only with a motion-\nless Erector-set reality. I don\u2019t think reductionism is so feeble.\nI was struck by the refrain that cells and organisms are \u201cfree\u201d to\nmake (choose, construct) \u201ctheir own futures.\u201d It sounds so brac-\ning and hopeful and brave, until it occurs to one to wonder why, if\nthis is true, so many of them construct such short and painful fu-\ntures for themselves, and almost all the rest construct inglorious\nand finite ones. \u201cChoice,\u201d when applied to cells, is peculiar. The\n\u201cself-determination\u201d of a cell, or an embryo (by which he means\nthat not all its story is read off from its genes) is not related to the\nfree will essential for moral responsibility, and pretty remotely kin\nto persuadability in everyday life and politics. I wondered whether\nRose thought it had something to do with either of them, and, if\nnot, why it seemed so important to him. The \u201cfreedom\u201d of cells\nfrom total determination by their genes is just \u201cslavery\u201d to their\nenvironments as well. This is so even if their environments are\nacted upon by their natures, which are chemical and physical.\nThat a cell during embryogenesis does not behave like a player pi-\nano, with its genes as bumps on the player roll, but is sensitive to\nand interactive with its continually changing environment, does\nnot imply that its behavior is undetermined by the laws of physics\nand chemistry. The only alternative determinants are impersonal\nlaws of randomness, or whims of supernatural agencies.\nSometimes Rose is so gleeful at denying genetic determinism a\npoint that he awards it to chemical determinism (pp. 170 ff). In\neven a noncellular context, he explains, ribosomes and micro-\ntubules, provided with the right chemicals, will assemble them-\nselves from components \u201cspontaneously, like oil films on water,\nwithout the need for specific genetic instructions \u2013 an intrinsic\nmolecular property which turns out to be at least as important for\nthe origin of life as do the famous replicating molecules of DNA\nand RNA.\u201d\nRose makes a useful distinction between the \u201cgenes\u201d of\nDawkins, which are \u201cinferred entities,\u201d and the actual \u201cgenes,\u201d\nblurrily visible under powerful microscopes, that are biochemical\nloci on chromosomes. These \u201creal\u201d genes are messy; they are\nspread along the chromosome; they are in pieces that are assem-\nbled, like words into sentences, to do different things at different\ntimes; most of them seem to have no function, some seem imper-\nvious to natural selection, and there is (he says) evidence that it \nis technically possible that Lamarckian effects might obtain.\nDawkins\u2019s \u201cgenes,\u201d in contrast, are whatever in the organism ex-\nplains the heredity of phenotypic characters. Rose believes that\nthis view of genes contributes to a careless and \u201cbrutish\u201d view of\norganisms, and that the carelessness and brutishness spreads right\nup to a view of human beings and human society, where it is dread-\nfully harmful. Which is why he got so untoward in the preface, I\nsuppose.\nI am not wise enough to decide whether any view based on an\nattempt to understand and explain the world ought to be rejected\nbecause it might have harmful political consequences. I shall in-\nstead assert that genetic determinism is not as stupid and untrue\nto the world and its ambiguities as Rose urges. The law of gravity\nseems simple and deterministic, yet not everything on earth is\nglommed together in one immobile mass. The law applies to every\nmolecule of water \u2013 yet water is not always at the lowest point. It\nis found suspended in the atmosphere, travelling up the tissues of\ntrees, hydrating cells by the gazillion, and piled up as snow on high\nplaces. Despite these apparent exceptions, the law of gravity is\nuniversal and holds. Similarly, if genes \u2013 the theoretical kind,\nwhich must ultimately be reduced to the physical kind \u2013 govern\nbehavior, they will do so subject to interference from other deter-\nminants, and there will be detours and apparent exceptions, which\nwe have not begun to work out. I am prepared to believe that we\nshall work them out and that the unity of explanation without\nemergent laws and entities will hold.\nNeurogenetic determinism is \na theological doctrine\nWalter J. Freeman\nDepartment of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at\nBerkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720-3200. wfreeman@socrates.berkeley.edu\nAbstract: In \u201cLifelines\u201d Steven Rose constructs a case against neuroge-\nnetic determinism based on experimental data from biology and in favor\nof a significant degree of self determination. Two philosophical errors in\nthe case favoring neurogenetic determinism are illustrated by Rose: cate-\ngory mistakes and an excessively narrow view of causality restricted to the\nlinear form.\nFred Allen, a comedian in the golden age of American radio in the\n1930s, used a metonymic device he called \u201cAllen\u2019s Alley\u201d to make\nsocial commentaries. In one of his mock interviews, this of iden-\ntical twins, a Wall Street financier and a Bowery bum, he asked\nthem to explain their differing circumstances. The broker boasted,\n\u201cMy mother was a drunk and my father was a gambler, so I hadda\nmake something of myself.\u201d The bum whined, \u201cMy mother was a\ndrunk and my father was a gambler, so what chance did I have?\u201d\nHere is the crux of Steven Rose\u2019s argument. Genetic determinists\nare willing to grant a share of control to the environment, but they\nare unwilling or unable to assign even a minute fraction to self-\ndetermination, because that would be equivalent, in their view, to\nexplaining the operations of the body by resort to mental or spir-\nitual causes, or even regression to miraculous suspension of the\nlaws of physics and molecular biology. This is a matter of princi-\nple, because assigning a fraction of 1% or even 0.1% of the deter-\nminants remaining after identifying the nature\u2013nurture sources of\ncontrol would violate the law of universal causality. Yet self-con-\ntrol in everyone is like a spark in a bit of tinder, which, if it catches,\ncan ignite a life of adventure, but if it goes out, can lead to a life\nof stale drudgery. Rose has fanned his spark into a campfire; now\nthe neurogenetic wolves are circling, looking to make a meal of\nwarm flesh.\nThe thesis that Rose advances is not an arcane exercise in the-\noretical biology. It addresses core questions: How are individuals\nin societies to confront the political and ideological forces by\nwhich some degree of social conformity must be achieved, and\nhow can individuals understand and deal with the rationales and\nexplanations of social controls that are provided by academics in\nneurobiology, sociobiology, and medicine? Chapter by chapter,\nRose wades through the experimental data and statistical analyses\nthat medical, social, and biological scientists use to demonstrate\ntheir conclusions that, in all societies, the choices that we citizens\nmake are caused by the chemicals in our foods, the pollutants in\nour cities, and the sequences of base pairs in our genes. These ma-\nterials mediate the release of hormones, the firing of action po-\ntentials in our brains, and the laying down of memory traces, start-\ning even within the uterus, that determine whom we will love or\nkill, and which stimuli and signals coming to us from our environ-\nments, outside our control, we will respond to.\nIn the course of 309 pages of erudite exposition and argument\nRose notes in passing that experimental biologists seldom read\nphilosophy and often regard their peers who do as declining\nthrough the stages of \u201cphilosopause\u201d and anecdotage into senility.\nWhat a mistake! Many of the critiques that Rose directs against re-\nductionism in biology have already been well thought through by\nphilosophers.\nOne of the threads that links his materials is Gilbert Ryle\u2019s\n(1949) concept of \u201ccategory mistakes.\u201d His now classical example\nis confusing a university with its collection of buildings or its fac-\nulty. This \u201creification,\u201d as Rose calls it, is the most damaging as-\npect of reductionism, because it identifies a character trait with a\nmolecule, each in an entirely distinctive realm of discourse. This\nsimplistic kind of thinking has led a generation of otherwise intel-\nligent college students to ingest a broad variety of substances in\nthe fruitless pursuit of chemical enhancement of their IQs, and by\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 893\nso doing to obviate the necessity for hard study, and it has been\nused to justify the wholesale sell-out of the profession of psychia-\ntry to the HMOs in the pursuit of quick and inexpensive chemical\nfixes of complex emotional problems, to mention only two of the\nmore obvious meretricious social practices based in category \nerrors.\nIn his pivotal Chapter 10 on \u201cThe Poverty of Reductionism\u201d\nRose writes (p. 279): \u201cNeurogenetic determinism, I argue, is\nbased on faulty reductive sequence whose steps include reifica-\ntion, arbitrary agglomeration, improper quantification, belief in\nstatistical \u2018normality\u2019, spurious localization, misplaced causality,\ndichotomous partitioning between genetic and environmental\ncauses, and the confounding of metaphor with homology.\u201d I sum-\nmarize this thread by means of the philosophical distinction be-\ntween linear causality and circular causality (Freeman, in press).\nThere are two major meanings of the verb \u201cto cause.\u201d The more\ncommon is to make an effect happen, which requires an agent to\nperform as a cause in a strict and invariant temporal order. This\nview supports what philosophers call \u201clinear causal chains,\u201d so that\nin theory, by linear extrapolation, every event can be derived by\nsteps from a First Cause, which for theists is God and for atheists\nis the Big Bang, or perhaps the latter as the tool of the former. In\nall cases this belief system provides the foundation of neuro-\ngenetic determinism.\nThe alternative and less common meaning is to explain without\ninvoking agency and with permission of simultaneity and even re-\nversal of time order. Philosopher Donald Davidson (1980) asks:\nWhy on earth should a cause turn an action into a mere happening and\na person into a helpless victim? Is it because we tend to assume, at least\nin the arena of action, that a cause demands a causer, agency and agent?\nSo we press the question: if my action is caused, what caused it? If I did,\nthen there is the absurdity of an infinite regress: if I did not, I am a vic-\ntim. But of course the alternatives are not exhaustive. Some causes have\nno agents. Among these agentless causes are the states and changes of\nstate in persons which, because they are reasons as well as causes, con-\nstitute certain events as free and intentional actions.\nCircular causality explains the interactions between semi-au-\ntonomous elements at multiple hierarchical levels. Rose provides\na full array of examples from multiple fields of biological research,\nparticularly his own in the molecular changes that relate to learn-\ning in simpler systems. But they are not that simple, ever.\nIs the lifeliner objectively free?\nSteve Fuller\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, United\nKingdom. steve.fuller@durham.ac.uk\nAbstract: Although Rose claims to rely on Marx\u2019s paradoxical view of his-\ntory to explain the freedom enjoyed by what he calls \u201clifelines,\u201d he blurs\nwhat one might call the \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d senses of freedom.\nThis, in turn, reflects his overreaction to biological reductionism. Conse-\nquently, in discussing biology-related policy issues, Rose fails to distinguish\ngenuinely efficacious interventions and merely convenient ones.\nSteven Rose periodically invokes the Marxist motto \u201cMen [sic]\nmake history but in circumstances not of their own choosing\u201d to\ncapture the concept of \u201clifeline,\u201d his nonreductionist, autopoietic\nversion of Richard Dawkins\u2019s \u201cextended phenotype.\u201d According to\nRose, an organism\u2019s genetic and ecological resources constrain the\ncourse of its development without fully determining it. The or-\nganism\u2019s actual trajectory is the result of multivariate interactions\nat several levels of organization, which together constitute the or-\nganism\u2019s \u201chomeodynamics,\u201d that is, its ongoing struggle to con-\nstruct a viable future from a fluctuating present. Rose\u2019s firm\ngrounding in the biochemistry of the nervous systems precludes\nvitalism as a metaphysical commitment, yet he sympathizes with\nthe vitalist picture of organisms as actively seeking alternative\nmeans in an everchanging environment to achieve ends that are,\nin some sense, independent of that environment. In light of this\npicture, Rose argues that at least some organisms \u2013 certainly hu-\nmans \u2013 enjoy a significant measure of freedom. But does Rose\u2019s\nconcept of lifeline actually live up to the Marxist motto? More gen-\nerally, does it constitute an adequate conception of freedom?\nThe paradoxical character of the theory of history epitomized in\nthe Marxist motto is normally explained in terms of a proposition\nfound in Hegel but traceable to Spinoza, Leibniz, and ultimately\nthe Stoics: freedom is the recognition of necessity. Rose (p. 18)\ntakes this to mean that once we realize the exact extent to which\nwe are constrained, we can act within our means to construct a\nworld worth inhabiting. However, this is a misleading, or at least\nincomplete, rendering of what Marx, Hegel, and their predeces-\nsors were trying to say. In addition, they believed that you cannot\ndetermine the degree of freedom someone enjoys without look-\ning at what follows from that person\u2019s actions. Freedom does not\nexist in a world where agents pursue many different courses of ac-\ntion that then issue in a much narrower range of outcomes. When\nthe present appears open to alternative futures, agents tend to re-\ngard the world solely in terms of the resources it provides to real-\nize their ends. Rose\u2019s rhetoric sometimes veers this way. Yet, de-\npending on the pattern of actual outcomes, the situation may be\nexactly reversed \u2013 our diverse action may simply be means to some\nother larger end. In that case, as long as we act within the relevant\noptions \u2013 almost any action will do \u2013 the larger end is served.\nNo doubt this sounds like I am inching towards Dawkins\u2019s\n\u201cgene\u2019s-eye view of the world,\u201d in which biological diversity has no\nproper end other than the safe conveyance of genetic information.\nYet, Marxists have also pointed to the proliferation of consumer\nchoices in advanced capitalism as having this character. Con-\nsumers spend increasing time and energy deliberating over possi-\nbilities; the long term and large scale consequences of these are\nusually negligible for their own lives, but they latently serve to re-\njuvenate the circulation of capital. Because consumers are regu-\nlarly presented with multiple options that force them to refine\ntheir wants more precisely than they otherwise might, they are un-\nlikely, in the normal run of things, to discover just how overdeter-\nmined their world really is. Thus, their subjective sense of free-\ndom lacks an objective basis. Joined in their belief in the cunning\nof reason in history, Dawkins and Marx see this point very vividly\nin a way that Rose does not.\nConsider what Rose rejects under the rubric of \u201creductionism.\u201d\nThere is more at stake than simply a denial of the gene\u2019s-eye view\nof the world. Also at issue is the very idea of a coherent systemic\nperspective from which the biological world can be regarded. For\nHegelians and their kin, there is a gold standard of objective free-\ndom, whereby an agent inhabiting a world can be said literally to\nknow what it is doing. If the standard is to be met in a given pop-\nulation, then the diversity of its members\u2019 actions must be\nmatched by an equal or greater diversity of outcomes. In addition,\nthese outcomes must generally correspond to what the members\nwanted, ideally in the terms they expected. If both conditions are\nsatisfied, then there are good grounds for concluding that the pop-\nulation is objectively free. From a systemic perspective, such a\npopulation exerts significant control over its collective future.\nAlthough the gold standard of objective freedom is impossibly\nhigh, it does enable us to distinguish between types of interven-\ntion one might make to improve the human condition. Specifi-\ncally, the most convenient level of intervention is not necessarily\nthe most efficacious, if it turns out that once a cause is removed,\nits deleterious effects are largely reproduced by another factor ei-\nther present or latent in the environment. The freedom exempli-\nfied by the intervention, then, would be merely subjective. Rose\nfalls potentially foul of this critique in his discussion of lung can-\ncer treatment (p. 305). Tobacco companies are currently major\nfunders of research into the molecular biology of the lungs and the\nlocalization of \u201cpredisposing\u201d genes for cancer. Rose regards this\nresearch as a strategic misdirection that capitalizes on the persua-\nsiveness of reductionist rhetoric. A more direct route to cutting\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n894 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nlung cancer, according to Rose, is simply to restrict the sale of to-\nbacco-based products, the use of which is known to be highly cor-\nrelated with incidence of lung cancer.\nBefore judging the adequacy of Rose\u2019s proposed intervention,\nwe would need to know its ultimate aim. What is the curtailment\nof tobacco sales meant to eliminate: lung cancer per se, premature\ndeath, excessive healthcare costs, a certain kind of lifestyle, or the\nunpleasantness of a smoke-filled environment? In some of these\ncases, the intervention may have the efficacious results Rose\nseeks. But in others, tobacco may simply be replaced by another\nset of products that engender largely the same effects or even\nworse. Which is which depends just as much on a clarification of\nends as on the presence of scientific knowledge and political will.\nBecause Rose fails to provide this clarification \u2013 what philoso-\nphers call \u201caxiology\u201d \u2013 his conception of freedom, though de-\nfended with scientific evidence, does not have the objective char-\nacter promised by his reliance on the Marxist motto.\nRose succeeds where Wilson fails\nJerry Hirsch\nDepartments of Psychology, Ecology, Ethology and Evolution, University of\nIllinois, Champaign, IL 61820. jhirsch@s.psych.uiuc.edu\nwww.psych.uiuc.edu\/people\/faculty.html\nAbstract: Rose\u2019s accomplishment in combining ontological unity with\nepistemological diversity contrasts it with Wilson\u2019s failure in overempha-\nsizing the former and not appreciating the latter. This commentary cites\nthe two most authoritative discussions of the inapplicability of heritability\nto human data, corrects several historical errors or inaccuracies in genet-\nics, and criticizes the characterizations of Jacques Loeb and Robert\nPlomin.\nI congratulate Professor Rose on a fine accomplishment. Though\nnot perfect, Lifelines is a tour de force of good sense and packed\nwith useful information, elegantly presented and well written. Not\nonly does he give us an eloquent account of what modern behav-\nioral biology had become and how it got there, but he has also\ntaken the trouble to delineate what it is not: he has expended the\ntime and effort to use Dawkins (and Dennett) as his foils.\nImmediately prior to receiving this book, I had completed re-\nviewing E. O. Wilson\u2019s 1998 Consilience: The unity of knowledge\n(Hirsch 1999). The contrast between the two books in their \napproaches to reductionism could not be more stark. In Rose\u2019s \nlanguage, Wilson argues for an absolute ontological unity: \u201cThe\ncentral idea of the consilience world view is that all tangible phe-\nnomena, from the birth of stars to the working of social institu-\ntions, are based on material processes that are ultimately re-\nducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of\nphysics\u201d (Wilson 1998, p. 297). Wilson fails completely to appre-\nciate what Rose correctly emphasizes: \u201cEach level of organization\nof the universe has its own meanings, which disappear at lower lev-\nels\u201d (p. 296); and \u201cTo understand the world\u2019s ontological unity we\nneed the epistemological diversity that the different levels of ex-\nplanation offer\u201d (Pr\u00e9cis, Ch. 4, last sentence).\nIn addition, Wilson repeatedly advocates heritability analyses:\n\u201cHeritability . . . measure has considerable merit . . . is the back-\nbone of human behavioral genetics . . . is a sound measure of the\ninfluence of genes on variation in existing environments. . . . Hu-\nman behavior genetics is an infant field of study. . . . In only one\nlevel of analysis, the estimation of heritability, can it be said to be\nan advanced scientific discipline\u201d (Wilson 1998, pp. 154, 155,\n170).\nDespite coming down on the side of the angels in his discussion\nof the misapplication of heritability analysis to human data, when\na problem has already been handled effectively in the literature by\nrecognized authorities, there is no excuse for Rose (or Wilson!) to\nignore their work and to attempt not very effectively to re-invent\nthe wheel. As I have previously emphasized in agreement with\nCavalli-Sforza, \u201cin science we all have an obligation to be familiar\nwith the current state-of-the-art and to incorporate previous de-\nvelopments into whatever we do\u201d (Hirsch 1997, p. 213). Today no\none interested (pro or con) in human heritability can ignore the\nfollowing analyses by the two distinguished statistical geneticists,\nOscar Kempthorne and Albert Jacquard, and both published in\nthe highly respected journal Biometrics:\nThe idea that heritability is meaningful in the human mental and be-\nhavioral arena is attacked. The conclusion is that the heredity\u2013IQ con-\ntroversy has been a \u201ctale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d To\nsuppose that one can establish effects of an intervention process when\nit does not occur in the data is plainly ludicrous. Mere observational\nstudies can easily lead to stupidities, and it is suggested that this has hap-\npened in the heredity\u2013IQ arena. The idea that there are racial\u2013genetic\ndifferences in mental abilities and behavioral traits of humans is, at best,\nno more than idle speculation. (Kempthorne 1978, p. 1)\nThe need for great rigour exists particularly in the case of research\nprojects which have serious implications for us all; this is the case when\npsychologists study the \u201cheritability of intellectual aptitudes.\u201d They\nshould take the precaution of systematically defining in a precise way\nthe sense in which they use the word \u201cheritability\u201d; they should also\nstate whether the assumptions under which this word can be used hold\ntrue in their studies. It is highly probable that most of the time this ex-\nercise in rigour would lead them to the conclusion that none of the three\nparameters proposed by geneticists can be of any use in solving their\nproblems. (Jacquard 1983, p. 476)\nI must correct some historical errors and\/or inaccuracies, which\nthough unfortunate, do not vitiate the important message of\nRose\u2019s book.\n1. It is not correct that \u201ccolour-blindness or haemophilia . . . oc-\ncur only in males\u201d (p. 103). Because the gene correlates of these\ntwo traits are located on the human X-chromosome and are re-\ncessive, they occur far more frequently in males than females. But\nthere certainly are affected women.\n2. It is inaccurate to suggest that \u201cMendel\u2019s laws . . . were con-\nfirmed and extended during the 1920s and 1930s when Thomas\nHunt Morgan and his team . . . found a suitable animal model . . .\nDrosophila melanogaster\u201d (p. 110). It was in 1909 that Morgan\nstarted studying the fly and by 1915 he and his team had already\npublished their first important book on the fly work, \u201cThe mecha-\nnism of Mendelian heredity.\u201d By 1933 Morgan had been awarded\nthe Nobel prize for that work. Rose\u2019s account of his fly eye-color\nexperiment states \u201cMorgan found some which seemed unusual . . .\nthey had red rather than white eyes (p. 110). It should read the re-\nverse: white rather than red eyes.\n3. It is inaccurate to say that \u201cthe other reason why Drosophila\nwere interesting to him was that their cells contained unusually\nlarge and readily visible chromosomes\u201d (p. 111). The giant poly-\ntene chromosomes in the nuclei of the salivary glands of\nDrosophila and other dipteran larvae were unknown until de-\nscribed by Painter in 1933.\n4. It is not historically correct that \u201cnorm of reaction . . . [is] a\nterm originally introduced by . . . Theodosius Dobzhansky in the\n1950s\u201d (p. 133). It was first defined and introduced in 1909 by\nRichard Woltereck, professor of zoology at Leipzig (Dunn 1965,\np. 96; Platt & Sanislow 1988, p. 254). It is certainly true that later\nDobzhansky emphasized the importance of the concept.\n5. After having characterized Richard Dawkins as \u201ctheoreti-\ncian-polemicist,\u201d it is grossly unfair to call Jacques Loeb (p. 109)\n\u201cthe Dawkins\u201d of his day. Merely because, from today\u2019s perspec-\ntive, Loeb might appear to have exaggerated the organism-as-\nmachine analogy and might have influenced Rockefeller funding\npolicy, this is no justification for dismissing Loeb\u2019s entire career.\nHe was a very productive, influential and highly respected scien-\ntist (an intimate and long-time [1891\u20131924] friend of T. H. Mor-\ngan, who certainly did not brook fools lightly). As reported: \u201cBe-\ntween 1901 and 1924 [year of his death], Loeb was proposed for\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 895\na Nobel Prize by about a hundred sponsors in ten different coun-\ntries\u201d (Nobel Foundation, 1962, p. 256). For evaluations by col-\nleagues (e.g., Osterhaut) and his students (e.g., Northrup, a No-\nbel laureate) who knew him well and\/or collaborated with him see\n(Hirsch 1973, especially pp. xvi\u2013xix).\n6. To Bouchard\u2019s refusal to allow his data to be scrutinized by\nRose and other scientists (p. 207) can be added the case of Robert\nPlomin discussed on p. 275 whose analyses Professor Peter\nSchoenemann (Purdue University) has been unable to examine,\neven after a member of the U.S. Congress (Collins, 22 June, 1995)\nrepeated the request for him.\nTo conclude, this is the best treatment, with which I am famil-\niar, of the limitations on reductionism, especially with the added\nintegration of the very important concept of epistemological di-\nversity.\nSteven Rose\u2019s alternative to ultra-Darwinism\nDavid L. Hull\nDepartment of Philosophy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208.\nd-hull@nwu.edu\nAbstract: Stephen Rose\u2019s formulation of evolutionary theory is too scat-\ntered and impressionistic to serve as a genuine alternative to ultra-\nDarwinism. In addition, he has muddied a distinction that is crucial to our\nunderstanding of evolutionary phenomenona \u2013 the distinction between\nhomologies and homoplasies.\nCreationist and Marxist critics of present-day evolutionary theory\nhave much in common. They both parody their opponents, but\nthis argumentative strategy is common throughout science, not to\nmention every other intellectual discipline. Most of their works\nconsist mainly in criticism. Constructive alternatives are notable\nfor their absence. \u201cIf you find present-day versions of evolution-\nary theory so deficient, where is your alternative?\u201d Phillip John-\nson, the current spokesman for creationism, replies that he is not\nobligated to provide such an alternative. Steven Rose, a Marxist,\nthinks that criticism alone is not enough. \u201cThe challenge to the op-\nponents of biological determinism is that, while we may have been\neffective in our critique of its reductionist claims, we have failed\nto offer a coherent alternative framework within which to inter-\npret living processes\u201d (p. ix). Rose wrote his Lifelines to meet this\nchallenge.\nHow successful is Rose at providing an alternative to what he\nterms \u201cultra-Darwinism\u201d? I am afraid not very. I agree with much\nof what Rose has to say and find many of his asides right on target.\nFor example, he argues that the conventional distinction between\nscience and technology is artificial. Building a bridge that stays up\nis a test of the theoretical principles used to build it, and develop-\ning a new instrument for conducting an experiment is as much a\ntechnological achievement as building a bridge (p. 57). According\nto Rose, science is more than individual scientists thinking up hy-\npotheses and testing them. It is \u201csocially organized hypothesis-\nmaking\u201d (p. 66). In response to those who would reduce highly\ncomplex systems to the actions of their simplest parts, he notes\nthat physicists are still unable to derive the properties of a sub-\nstance as simple as water from the quantum states of its con-\nstituent atoms (p. 88). And, finally, he argues that Edelman\u2019s\nneural Darwinism is a \u201cseductively misleading metaphor\u201d (p. 144).\nAs much as I agree with all the preceding observations, I just as\nstrongly reject other parts of his exposition. Some of my reserva-\ntions concern minor points. For example, Rose repeats the tired\nold story of how male scientists have portrayed sperm as active\nagents in finding their way to fertilize passive ova. He states that\nit is \u201cincreasingly apparent that the ovum is not merely the passive\nrecipient of the victorious sperm, but plays an active part in the\nprocess\u201d (p. 152), a view that has been commonplace for over half\na century. But some stories are too good not to keep retelling even\nif they are not true. As we all know, lemmings march to the sea to\ncommit mass suicide, the good-tasting viceroy butterfly protects\nitself from its predators by mimicking the bad-tasting monarch,\nand male praying mantises succeed in copulating with female\nmantises by offering the upper parts of their body as food while\nthe lower parts do their business. That none of these stories is true\nseems to bother no one. To add to this list, doubt has been recently\ncast on the most famous example of all \u2013 industrial melanism in\nthe peppered moth.\nBut not all of my reservations with respect to Rose\u2019s book are so\nminor. Through the years I have come to realize that the distinc-\ntion made by biologists between homologies and homoplasies is\nfundamental to our understanding of natural processes. We can\nperceive regularities and patterns in nature. Some of them are due\nto common descent; for example, the spiracle in sharks is homol-\nogous to the Eustachian tube in humans. But other patterns do\nnot depend on genealogical relations. Some are due to the per-\nformance of common functions in similar processes; for example,\na torpedo-like shape is common among aquatic organisms that\nspend a good deal of time swimming. The similarity in shape\namong so many aquatic organisms is homoplastic. If one wants to\nreconstruct phylogenies, homologies are the message and homo-\nplasies are noise. If one wants to understand the evolutionary\nprocess, homoplasies supply the message and homologies are\nnoise.\nRose succeeds in obliterating this important distinction. For\nRose, \u201chomologies\u201d imply a \u201cdeeper identity, derived from an as-\nsumed common evolutionary origin\u201d (p. 34), but then he goes on\nto offer two alternatives to homologies \u2013 metaphors and analogies.\nIn metaphors, phenomena that occur in different domains are\ncompared; for example, the energy flow controlled by ATP and the\nflow of currency in a bank. Analogies concern superficial resem-\nblances between two phenomena; for example, the blood circu-\nlates in animals as sap circulates through plants. I am afraid I fail\nto see any significant differences between metaphors and analo-\ngies as Rose defines them. But more important, he leaves out\nthose entities that are deemed similar because they perform the\nsame function in similar processes or, as they are called in the\nphilosophical literature, natural kinds. Nature can be subdivided\ninto kinds in numerous different ways. The task is to find kinds\nthat function in natural regularities (commonly termed laws of na-\nture).\nRose admits that within the world of human artifacts \u201cit may not\nbe unreasonable to try to seek the essence of, say, a table or chair\u201d\n(p. 35). Such an essentialist view of the world \u201cmay even be pos-\nsible when one is studying inanimate phenomena such as comets,\nelectrons or chemical elements\u201d (p. 35). But the living world, so\nhe claims, cannot be subdivided into kinds that function in laws of\nnature. He first argues that lineages such as species and sub-\nspecies are not natural kinds because they are temporary, spa-\ntiotemporally restricted, and have at best fuzzy boundaries in con-\nceptual space. I could not agree more.\nI have been arguing this position almost as long as Ernst Mayr\nand Michael Ghiselin. Rose then turns his attention to individual\norganisms. They are not natural kinds and for the same reasons.\nFinally, Rose moves to the molecular level arguing that proteins\nand enzymes are not natural kinds either because they must be\nfunctionally, rather than structurally defined. He does not say why\nfunctionally defined kinds cannot function as natural kinds. But,\nmore important, he ignores all the genuine kinds to be found in\necology (such as carnivores, herbivores, and parasites) and evolu-\ntionary biology (such as founder populations, peripheral isolates,\nand possibly the species category itself ).\nBut to return to the opening paragraph of this review: Does\nRose provide anything like a coherent alternative to ultra-\nDarwinism? As far as I can judge, he has not.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n896 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nSelection and \u201cfreedom\u201d in biology \nand psychology\nJulian C. Leslie\nSchool of Psychology, University of Ulster at Jordanstown, Newtownabbey,\nNorthern Ireland, BT37 0QB. jc.leslie@ulst.ac.uk\nAbstract: Rose provides a coherent account of how a number of simpli-\nfying assumptions apparently come together to support neurogenetic de-\nterminism, or \u201cultra-Darwinism.\u201d This view, he demonstrates, is deeply\nflawed. He proposes instead that we must take account of the interaction\nof processes that determine our developmental trajectory at every stage.\nUnfortunately, he associates this defensible position with the claim that\nthis gives freedom of action to humans. The implications of this for the in-\nterpretation of his general thesis are discussed.\nThe greatest obstacle to progress in the behavioural and brain sci-\nences is the use of inappropriate theoretical models. In the Anglo-\nSaxon tradition, we often fail to see the need to articulate the un-\nstated assumptions which underpin our proposed explanations in\nspecific areas. In this book, as previously, Rose does a great ser-\nvice by attending meticulously to questions of underlying as-\nsumptions. Some of these are summarised, late in the book, in his\nsuccinct summary of neurogenetic determinism.\nIn Rose\u2019s view, neurogenetic determinism involves the steps \nof \u201creification, arbitrary agglomeration, improper quantification,\nbelief in statistical \u2018normality\u2019, spurious localization, misplaced\ncausality, dichotomous partitioning between genetic and environ-\nmental causes, and the confounding of metaphor with homology.\u201d\n(p. 279). Behaviour analysts, from Skinner (e.g., 1950) onwards,\nhave shared many of these concerns. One of Rose\u2019s strengths is his\nclear recognition that from a general belief in unified science \u2013\nthe belief that phenomena at one level can in principle be trans-\nlated into phenomena at \u201clower\u201d levels \u2013 nothing in particular fol-\nlows about preferred levels of description and explanation. Rather,\neach level has its own explanatory system and particular purposes\nwhich it can achieve. In this context, behavioral accounts of psy-\nchological phenomena may, for example, be seen as independent\nof, rather than poor substitutes for, psychological or genetic ac-\ncounts of human behaviour. Also, as Rose illustrates, there are as-\npects of psychological phenomena which exist solely at that level\nand cannot be related to direct genetic influence.\nThere is much to applaud here, as elsewhere in Lifelines. There\nare many themes in this impressive and exciting book which chime\nwith the selectionist and functional-analytic themes of contempo-\nrary behaviour analysis. This may lay the groundwork for the anal-\nogy between natural selection as an evolutionary mechanism for\nspecies and the selection of behaviour in the individual by its con-\nsequences (see Skinner 1969, Ch. 7) to be extended.\nMuch public discussion of the behavioural and brain sciences,\nin broadcast media as well as in print, is dominated by those who\nwould persuade us that we need only one level of explanation, and\none explanatory principle. Throughout this book, Rose points up\nthe inadequacy of these tactics in general and as used by neuro-\ngenetic determinists in particular. This is a task well worth doing,\nand it is done well. However, as with his earlier treatment of some\nrelated issues (Rose et al. 1984), I am left uneasy as to how non-\nspecialists (or even specialists) will interpret its implications for\nthe psychological explanation of human behaviour. The problems\narise out of Rose\u2019s concern to point out the limitations of excessive\nreliance on natural selection at the level of the single gene to ex-\nplain all biological phenomena.\nLet us examine Rose\u2019s summary of his own case against neuro-\ngenetic determinism or \u201cultra-Darwinism\u201d (p. 215). There are\nfour claims:\n1. Selection occurs at levels other than that of the single gene.\n2. Natural selection is only one of several factors producing\nevolutionary change.\n3. Organisms are not indefinitely responsive to change.\n4. In Rose\u2019s words: \u201cOrganisms are not mere passive respon-\nders to selective forces, but active players in their own destiny.\u201d\nWhile accepting Rose\u2019s assertion that his \u201cprincipal target is the\ndogmatic gene\u2019s-eye view of the world,\u201d I want to consider Rose\u2019s\naccount of the fourth claim which will tend to catch the attention\nof all general readers as well as that of psychologists. With this\nfourth claim he allows for the possibility that conventional men-\ntalism may take the place of rigorous philosophical and scientific\nanalysis. Very early in the book, he sets the stage for this disap-\npointing coda. There is an assertion that: \u201cThe central property of\nall life is the capacity and necessity to build, maintain and preserve\nitself, a process known as autopoiesis. This why . . . we, as living\norganisms and specifically as humans, are free agents.\u201d (p. 18).\nAlong with this (p. 9), he has specifically included mentalistic psy-\nchology as one level of explanation in a critique of the notion of\nthe hierarchy of the sciences. Taking the book as a whole, then, it\nis possible for the reader to conclude that Rose concurs with those\nnonscientific commentators who wish to believe that a determin-\nistic and scientific account of human psychology is not possible.\nI do not think this is Rose\u2019s position. The problem is a subtle one\nof presentation. In a further account of autopoiesis (p. 245), he is\nat pains to distinguish his account from one in which purpose di-\nrects evolutionary change: \u201cAutopoiesis, organisms as active play-\ners, is as apparent when a single-celled organisms swims away\nfrom a depleted food source towards a richer one, as . . . in the de-\ncision of an impoverished Mexican to cross the border into Cali-\nfornia\u201d (p. 245). This comparative analysis is really no different\nfrom that used by Skinner (1972), who noted that the behaviour\nof many species including humans is modified by contingencies of\nreinforcement. Furthermore, although humans prefer to live\nwithin social systems that positively reinforce prosocial behaviour\nrather than those that punish antisocial behaviour, they are never\n\u201cfree\u201d in the conventional sense of that word. Rather, their be-\nhaviour is selected by the prevailing contingencies of reinforce-\nment. Skinner concluded that, in Western traditions, the aspira-\ntion \u201cto be free\u201d meant \u201cto be free from aversive control.\u201d Rose\nsays that we are \u201cfree,\u201d but he actually means that we are influ-\nenced by a complex set of forces, and no one of these can be said\nto determine our eventual behavioural state or psychological char-\nacteristics. As with other biological phenomena, human behaviour\ncan only be understood in terms of the interaction of many pro-\ncesses over the lifespan.\nGenetic and biological determinants \nof psychological traits\nColin Martindale\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469.\nrpy383@maine.maine.edu\nAbstract: Rose seems to be arguing against an extreme ultra-Darwinism\nthat probably has no adherents. He incorrectly argues that a number of\npsychological traits are very difficult to measure. This is not the case. Rose\nargues that intelligence has no biological correlates. In fact, it is correlated\nwith brain size, EEG evoked potentials, and cerebral glucose uptake dur-\ning problem solving. Data that Rose should be aware of are omitted when\nthey do not fit the case he is trying to make.\nRose raises various objections to sociobiology and what he calls ul-\ntra-Darwinism. By the latter, he means a reductionist, determin-\nist biology which, among other things, attributes a number of traits\nsuch as intelligence to genetic causes and, at least in some ver-\nsions, claims that the only point of organisms is to replicate genes.\nHis refutation fails for a number of reasons. Other commentators\nwill doubtless point them out. I restrict myself to comments on his\nremarks on behavioral genetics.\nRose does not deny that there are biological determinants of\ntraits such as intelligence. Environmentalists have surrendered on\nthis issue (Sternberg & Grigorenko 1997). They have been re-\nduced to quibbling about the proportion of variation in intelli-\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 897\ngence that can be attributed to genetics. Their preferred estimate\nis around 40% as opposed to hereditarians\u2019 preferred estimate of\nat least 70%. Rose tries various tricks to discredit the concept of\nintelligence. On page 69, he lumps together the idea that IQ tests\nmeasure \u201csome fixed, biologically determined feature of an indi-\nvidual\u201d with the ideas that the moon is made of cheese and that\nthe earth is flat. In fact, because intelligence involves speed of\nmental processing, reaction time on a variety of tasks is correlated\nwith IQ (Jensen 1982). More telling, there are reliable differences\nbetween more and less intelligent people in glucose uptake in the\nbrain during problem solving (Haier et al. 1988). EEG evoked po-\ntentials are related to intelligence (Caryl 1994). Finally, there is \nno longer any question that intelligence is related to brain size\n(Jensen & Sinha 1993). Like it or not, intelligence is related to bi-\nology. It is difficult to imagine how one could learn one\u2019s brain size\nor glucose uptake rate; it is quite easy to see how such things could\nresult from genetic factors.\nOn p. 190 we are told that intelligence is not easy to measure,\nand it is implied that it is as difficult to measure as political ten-\ndency, religiosity, job satisfaction, and so on. The latter traits are\neasier to measure than intelligence, but all can be quite reliably\nand validly measured. The possibility that Sir Cyril Burt\u2019s data on\nthe heritability of intelligence may have been fraudulent is men-\ntioned on p. 191. Rose neglects to mention that Burt\u2019s heritability\nestimate for IQ is about the same as that found in dozens of other\nstudies in which no fraud has ever been alleged.\nAnother disquieting omission concerns the fact that Thomas\nBouchard, who is involved in the largest study of twins reared\napart, would not allow Rose to see his primary data. This was prob-\nably due to U.S. laws regarding confidentiality. Were I to do an in-\nnocuous study of preference for polygons, I could not show Rose\nmy primary data. I would first have to remove all information con-\ncerning the identity of the participants. There are many studies of\ntwins reared apart in countries with laws different from those in\nthe United States. Looking at the primary data will not change the\nfacts they contain.\nThe standard formula for computing heritability only works if\ngenetic effects are additive. [See Wahlsten: \u201cInsensitivity of the\nAnalysis of Variance to Heredity \u2013 Environment Interaction\u201d BBS\n13(1) 1990.] However, Rose does not tell us that concordance\nrates (if one twin has a trait does the other also have it?) provide\nabout the same information as heritability per se. If concordance\nis higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins, this is evidence\nfor a genetic contribution to the trait. This is especially true if the\ntwins were reared apart. Rose may not like it that there is a large\ngenetic component in traits as diverse as attitude toward the death\npenalty and probability of divorce. To try to explain the findings\naway by saying that they arose from the use of statistics originally\ndeveloped for plant and animal breeding will not do. Many statis-\ntics used in psychology are derived from or identical to statistics\ndeveloped in agriculture. The numbers don\u2019t know what they are\nabout; it would have been pointless to re-invent statistical wheels.\nAttributing findings in behavior genetics to the statistics used\ndoes not explain why some things are consistently found to be ge-\nnetic and others not. For example, anyone who does a study of\nmanic-depressive illness will find a concordance rate of about 80%\nfor monozygotic twins and 20% for dizygotic twins (Goodwin &\nJamison 1990). Probably anyone studying attitudes toward pajama\nparties would find a concordance rate of about zero for both types\nof twins. We can think of paths from proteins to psychological\ntraits. It is difficult to see why statistics would consistently associ-\nate some traits but not others.\nSome misunderstandings and\nmisinterpretations about sociobiology \nand behavior genetics in Lifelines\nby Steven Rose\nStephen C. Maxson\nDepartment of Psychology, Graduate Degree Program in Biobehavioral\nSciences, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269-4154.\nmaxtiger@aol.com\nAbstract: Lifelines by Steven Rose is supposed to present a new perspec-\ntive on biology replacing an emphasis on genes with one on organisms.\nHowever, much of the book is a highly biased critique of sociobiology and\nbehavior genetics. Some of the flaws in Rose\u2019s description and depiction\nof these fields are presented and refuted. Also, it would appear that these\naspects of the book and many others are, in fact, related more to Rose\u2019s\nperennial concern for the ideology, social origins or social consequences\nof behavioral biology. These concerns are, I believe based, in part, upon\nRose\u2019s misunderstandings and misinterpretations of genetics, behavior ge-\nnetics, and sociobiology.\nLifelines by Steven Rose is supposed to present a new perspective\non biology which emphasizes organisms rather than genes. How-\never, much of the book is a biased critique of sociobiology and be-\nhavior genetics.\nWilson defined sociobiology as \u201cthe systematic study of the bi-\nological basis of all social behavior\u201d (1975, p. 4), and he included\nin it both proximate and ultimate explanations for the causes of so-\ncial behaviors. These are similar to the five types of explanations\ndescribed on pages 10\u201314 of Rose\u2019s book. One of these focuses on\nwhether or not a social behavior is adaptive, and whether or not\nthe adaptation is due to natural selection acting in the past on her-\nitable variants.\nThose concerned with the origin of behavioral adaptations are\nrarely interested in the exact details of their genetics (Barkow et\nal. 1992; Krebs & Davies 1993). However, Rose suggests that ul-\ntra-Darwinian sociobiologists do not recognize a possible role of\nepistatic interactions among genes in effects of selection on the\nevolution of social behaviors. This is false, at least for the follow-\ning sociobiologists. Wilson (1975, p. 70) writes, \u201cReal selection,\nhowever, is directed not at genes but at individuals, containing on\nthe order of tens of thousands of genes or more, and . . . relatively\nsmall amounts of interactions between loci can generate suffi-\nciently tight linkage disequilibria to make the entire chromosome\nrespond to selection as a unit.\u201d These are not the words of Rose\u2019s\nultra-Darwinist. Similarly, Dawkins (1982, p. 111) writes, \u201cThe\nstatistical structure of the gene-pool sets up climate or environ-\nment which affects the success of any one gene relative to its \nalleles. . . . The point is the obvious one that selection at one locus\nis not independent of selection at other loci.\u201d Again, these are not\nthe statements of Rose\u2019s ultra-Darwinist. Yet Wilson and Dawkins\nare, for Rose, archetypes of ultra-Darwinian sociobiologists.\nRose also suggests that they believe that all behaviors are adap-\ntations due to effects of natural selection acting on heritable vari-\nants, and that there is no other explanation for the evolution of be-\nhavior. However, Dawkins (1982, p. 29) writes \u201cThis is not to say\nthat all behaviour patterns necessarily have a Darwinian function.\nIt may be that there is a large class of behaviour patterns which\nare selectively neutral or deleterious to their performers, and can\nnot usefully be regarded as products of natural selection.\u201d He goes\non to his own \u201ccritique of naive adaptationism\u201d and his own list of\nconstraints on the evolution of adaptations, including those for be-\nhavior. Similar material is discussed by Wilson (1975) with regard\nto phylogenetic inertia as a constraint on adaptations. He also con-\nsiders the role of inbreeding and genetic drift in evolution, in-\ncluding that of behavior. Regardless, even Rose accepts the possi-\nbility that some behaviors are adaptations due to natural selection\nacting on heritable variations. But he seems to believe that most\nif not all involve selection at the group rather than the individual\nlevel.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n898 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nRose appears to be more concerned with claims for behavioral\nadaptations in humans than in animals. He suggest that ultra-\nDarwinian sociobiologists, such as E. O. Wilson and R. Dawkins,\nbelieve that altruism and other social behaviors in humans are an\neffect of kin selection acting in the past on heritable variants, and\nthat they reject cultural explanations for human social behaviors.\nHowever, this is not their position. Wilson (1975) recognizes four\npeaks in the evolution of social behavior. These occur in the colo-\nnial invertebrates, the eusocial insects, nonhuman mammals, and\nhumans. He believes that kin selection was the most likely in-\nvolved in the evolution of social behavior of colonial invertebrates\nand eusocial insects, and that it plays little or no role in the evolu-\ntion of social behavior in nonhuman mammals or humans. In 1975\n(p. 381), he writes, \u201cThe requisite refinement and personalization\nin vertebrate relationships are achieved by . . . a greater role of\nlearning\u201d and in 1978 (pp. 153 and 156), he writes, \u201cHuman social\nevolution is obviously more cultural than genetic\u201d and \u201cThrough\nconvention of reciprocation, combined with a flexible, endlessly\nproductive language and a genius for verbal classification, human\nbeings fashion long-remembered agreements upon which cul-\ntures and civilizations can be built.\u201d Similarly, Dawkins (1976) rec-\nognizes the role of learning and culture in human behavior and\nadaptations; To better understand their role, he developed the\nconcept of the \u201cmeme.\u201d\nIn contrast to most sociobiologists, most behavior geneticists are\nconcerned with the details of the genetics that are involved in in-\ndividual differences in adaptive and nonadaptive behaviors in lab-\noratory and natural populations of many organisms, including bac-\nteria, protozoans, round worms, mollusks, fruit flies, and other\narthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. How-\never, most of the emphasis has been as elsewhere in genetics on\nround worms, fruit flies, mice, and humans. Since many variations\nin many behavioral traits are due to variation in alleles of more than\none gene, the concepts and methods of quantitative genetics,\nwhich had their beginnings not only in the works of Fisher (1930)\nbut also Wright (1968), have been widely used. This partitions the\nphenotypic variance into genetic and environmental components.\nThe genetic variance is again partitioned into additive, dominance,\nand interaction components. All three components can be and\nhave been assessed in quantitative genetic analyses of animal and\nhuman behaviors (Plomin et al. 1997; Rose 1994).\nAs Rose recognizes, these components can be used to estimate\nthe broad (genetic variance\/phenotypic variance) or narrow (ad-\nditive variance\/total variance) heritability of behaviors in animals.\nThis has been done by Dobzhansky (1968), among others. It\nwould appear that the biochemical, genetic, cellular, and devel-\nopmental complexities and interactions which occur in both ani-\nmals and humans would not be, for Rose, problematical in esti-\nmates of heritability for not only animal but also human behaviors.\nHowever, as Rose indicates, genetic and environmental effects on\nindividual differences may be confounded in studies of humans\nbut not animals. Adoption studies of individuals and of twins\nraised apart can address this problem (Plomin et al. 1997; Rose\n1994).\nRose does not directly critique the latter method. Rather, he\nmakes misleading statements about the studies of Thomas\nBouchard on twins reared apart. He says that Bouchard and his\ncolleagues have published their finding in obscure, unrefereed\njournals. However, Bouchard and his colleagues have published\ntheir findings in Science (Bouchard et al. 1990), The Journal of\nPersonality (Bouchard & McGue 1990), and the American Jour-\nnal of Psychiatry (Segal et al. 1990). He also claims that Bouchard\nhas refused him and others access to the primary data, but he ne-\nglects to mention that both informed consent agreements and fed-\neral law prohibit release of primary data which would identify in-\ndividuals in this study (Wright 1998).\nLifelines is a difficult book to read and to review. Among the rea-\nsons for this are:\n1. Rose frequently makes disparaging personal comments\nabout those that he disagrees with. For example, he writes (p. 5)\nof R. Dawkins, \u201cwith all the brash style of a cheeky adolescent\ncocking a snook at everything his elders hold dear.\u201d Similarly, he\ndescribes the young James Watson as ambitious and bumptious.\n2. It is replete with factual errors. For example, on page 4, Rose\nwrites, \u201cgenetic generalizations are still derived from just three or-\nganisms, the rat. . . .\u201d Actually mice and not rats are the primary\nmammalian organism used in genetic research. He also overlooks\nthe contributions of C. elegans and all plants to genetics. Also, he\nclaims that an article of mine (Maxson 1996) argues for genes with\neffects on mouse killing by rats as a model for human aggression.\nIn fact, my paper is not about interspecific aggression of rats but\nrather about intraspecific aggression of mice as animal models.\n3. As already indicated, his comments on and critiques of so-\nciobiology and behavioral genetics are seriously flawed. There are\nsimilar errors with regard to population genetics. For example, he\nwrites (p. 216), \u201cFisher and Haldane\u2019s approach was derided as\n\u2018beanbag\u2019 genetics precisely because it depended for its mathe-\nmatics on the assumption that each gene was an isolated unit.\u201d \nIn fact, Fisher, Haldane, and Wright were aware of the existence\nof gene interactions, and the difference among the three was \nnot with regard to the fact of gene interactions but rather with re-\ngard to the most effective population size for adaptive evolution\n(Provine 1971). Also, Lewontin (1998, p. 62) writes, \u201cThus, theory\nhad a bad name . . . as bean bag genetics, solely concerned with\nindividual genes. This reaction has hidden the essential contribu-\ntion of Wright in 1931 and of Fisher in 1918. They were interested\nin coping with gene interactions from the very beginning.\u201d\n4. Rose\u2019s book seems to be as much, if not more, about biology\nand politics. Although he writes (p. xi), \u201cI largely refrain from dis-\ncussing the ideology, social origins or social consequences of ultra-\nDarwinism and reductionism,\u201d he frequently takes up this topic as\non pages 73\u201374, 115\u201316, 192, 212, and 272\u2013301. These detract\nfrom the development of his theory of Lifelines, and it may ac-\ncount for the absence in his book of some relevant and significant\ntopics such as homeobox genes and development (Gehring 1998).\nA holistic developmental theory requires\nbetter research techniques\nGeorge F. Michel\nPsychology Department, DePaul University, Chicago, IL 60614-3504.\ngmichel@condor.depaul.edu depaul.edu\/~gmichel\nAbstract: Research pragmatics, not a defective conceptual framework,\nsupports modern biological reductionism. Conducting research to reveal\nthe casual web underlying the multiple developmental pathways leading\nto any species-specific characteristic requires better research techniques\nthan those commonly used. It takes much patience, time, and effort to gain\neven small glimpses of an answer to any developmental question.\nLifelines presents a coherent account of living systems that inte-\ngrates physics, chemistry, and biology in a way that is intended to\nundercut any attempt to use only reductionistic explanations of\nthe human condition. As Rose notes, deterministic biological ex-\nplanations resurfaced during the late 1960s without any specific\nadvance in biological science or theory. However, they have been\nadvanced (to the dismay of thoughtful scientists) by recent bio-\nmedical and popular interpretations of modern molecular genet-\nics and neuroscience. Rose argues that the reductionist trend\nstems from both a tradition of determinism in biological training\nand thinking and the failure of \u201copponents of biological deter-\nminism . . . to offer a coherent alternative framework within which\nto interpret living processes\u201d (p. ix). However, many such frame-\nworks have been proposed during the last 100 years and several\nquite recently (cf. Elman et al. 1996; Gottlieb et al. 1998; Michel\n& Moore 1995). Why then does reductionism persist?\nThe reductionist tradition certainly influences the way many bi-\nologically oriented investigators pose research questions, apply re-\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 899\nsearch techniques, interpret findings, and train students. It does\nso because this is more efficient in generating research results and\nproviding ready interpretations than research that \u201ccelebrates\ncomplexity\u201d and focuses on the specific dynamics of the organism-\nenvironment system over its life-span. While I appreciate Rose\u2019s\nefforts, biological determinism will continue to dominate because\nunraveling the organismic-experiential causal web underlying the\nmultiple developmental pathways of species-typical characteris-\ntics is not easily done, nor is there a generally accepted set of tech-\nniques for doing so.\nIn contrast, researchers in neuroscience, molecular and behav-\nior genetics, sociobiology, and cognitive science, have shown that\nit is relatively easy to conduct research on questions of proximate\ncausation, phylogenetic relationships, and adaptive function.\nThere are many ways to investigate the contributions of genes and\nvarious neural processes and structures to behavior and many of\nthese involve exciting new technologies to attract popular interest.\nOf course, only reductionism assumes the nervous system to be\norganized by gene-controlled processes (Rose nicely illuminates\nthe difference between genetic involvement and genetic control).\nSociobiology has demonstrated the efficiency of collecting data\nthat address alternative game-theoretical or economic models of\ngeneralized types of behavior, presumably controlled by genes.\nSuch results fit current thinking about adaptation and natural se-\nlection so well that they tempt researchers away from pursuing de-\nvelopmental questions.\nIn contrast, typical developmental research techniques are lim-\nited and problematic. Many studies involve correlating individual\ndifferences earlier and later in development. This does not reveal\nwhether the individuals have changed between measurement pe-\nriods (a developmental event). Nor do these studies reveal the de-\nvelopmental processes that contribute to maintaining relative po-\nsition across age periods. The absence of correlation may be\ninterpreted by reductionists as indicating that early developmen-\ntal events have no impact on later events because they are biolog-\nically controlled. Alternatively, high correlation may be inter-\npreted as strong biological control during that age period.\nOther developmental techniques examine the relation between\na manipulation (or clinical event) occurring earlier in develop-\nment and the individual\u2019s characteristics later in development.\nEven if a relation exists, nothing is revealed about the causal web\nconnecting the two developmental periods. If a relation does not\nexist, nothing is revealed about the processes that blocked the con-\nnection.\nA common technique of depriving an organism of certain ex-\nperiences to determine their influence on development presumes\nthat one already knows or suspects that such experiences con-\ntribute to development. A few carefully crafted programmatic\nstudies have revealed that development can depend upon experi-\nences which do not at first appear to be relevant. Thus, the ab-\nsence of deprivation effects only means that the missing experi-\nences were not relevant for that developmental outcome, or if they\nwere, that their loss could be compensated for by other means.\nFor example, in some bird species, song can develop without hear-\ning other singing birds or the bird\u2019s own singing, but that does not\nrule out other auditory experience. Even if for some species all au-\nditory experience were ruled out, other experiences (e.g., vestibu-\nlar and\/or respiratory experience, or specific social experiences)\ncould be involved (Clayton 1994). Thus, although deprivation\nstudies can fail to reveal how develop occurs, they can support re-\nductionist interpretations.\nSince models of learning often fail to provide insight into the\ndevelopment of many species-typical characteristics, some argue\nthat individual experience is unimportant for them. However,\nlearning models represent only a small part of the range of expe-\nriential events that contribute to development, some of them\nseemingly irrelevant. Most stimulation studies fail to identify the\nexperiential influences on development because they provide ei-\nther a broad-band level of stimulation that approximates those\nthat are characteristic of the natural environment more than the\nusual laboratory situation, or they provide unusually high levels of\nvery complex stimulation. No one would deny that approximating\na normal environment can support normal development or that\nnormal development can be disrupted by stress or overstimula-\ntion. Hence such studies do not challenge reductionism. Only a\nfew studies (e.g., bird-song, imprinting, sex differences in rat be-\nhavior) have manipulated levels and patterns of stimulation within\nthe bounds of their normal occurrence to identify their contribu-\ntion to the development of species-typical behavior (cf. Gottlieb\net al. 1998; Ten Cate 1994; Moore 1992). In each case, such ex-\nperiences are profoundly involved in the normal development of\nthe species-typical behavior.

As Rose rightly\npoints out, biological enquiry includes many different kinds of question.\nGenetic determinism, making genes central to biology, is therefore biased\nand misguided. The crucial unit must be the whole organism.\nThe clash between determinism and free will is not, as is often\nsaid, a hopeless, unavoidable philosophical deadlock. Mostly it is\nsimply the product of an arbitrary, vague, overambitious concept\nof determinism. Karl Popper wrote the epitaph of that concept,\nobserving, \u201cPhysical determinism . . . was a day-dream of omni-\nscience which seemed to become more real with every advance of\nphysics until it became an apparently inescapable nightmare.\u201d2\nHe meant, of course, that claiming omniscience turned out to be\nincompatible with human freedom. We now know, too, that this\nslapdash deterministic claim has faults that go far beyond this par-\nticular inconvenience. Within physics itself, the traditional idea of\ndeterminism is now openly scheduled for rethinking.\nHowever, the trouble is not confined to physics. The need to re-\nthink determinism in biology is even more urgent, though it has\nnot yet been so fully understood. Lifelines firmly grasps this alarm-\ning nettle. It both shows the urgency of the need and suggests con-\nstructively the general lines on which we might meet it.\nRose attends sharply to metaphors, which are of course the\nmain channel through which such large-scale concepts shape our\nthinking. Biologists (he says) should insist that organisms make\nthemselves rather than being helpless objects driven by the chem-\nicals that compose them \u2013 rather than being, for instance, \u201cthe \nvehicles of their genes.\u201d Of course, both these formulations are\nmetaphors drawn from the same human concept of agency. But\nthe first formulation needs to be sharply stressed today in order to\nbalance the second, which has lately got entirely out of hand.\nThe active-passive story has been used to give a bizarre dra-\nmatic twist to the notion of causality, suggesting a transaction\nwhere a genuinely active entity drives an inert, passive one rather\nthan a neutral process within which they both play their part. Thus\n(as Rose points out), recent talk about genes often seems to ab-\nstract from their own causal context altogether, treating them as if\nthey were somehow autonomous uncaused causes, prime movers\nin the evolutionary game.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n900 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nCurrent notions of determinism easily encourage this kind of\none-sidedness, because the determinist framework is usually\nlinked with a particular study, thus giving that study\u2019s favoured en-\ntities a strange kind of privileged causal force. We see many kinds\nof hyphenated determinism, of which Skinner\u2019s social-determin-\nism was a striking example. Others have been economic-, physi-\ncal- or neurogenetic. Each variant claims that its chosen study pro-\nvides the most fundamental form of understanding available, that\nthe causes it deals with are the only ultimately effective causes.\nThese hyphenated determinisms are, then, necessarily biased.\nThey are reductive in the general sense of downgrading other\nstudies to secondary, provisional status. They embody the ambi-\ntious Enlightenment project of providing a single unified expla-\nnation of all phenomena \u2013 Popper\u2019s \u201cday-dream of omniscience\u201d\n\u2013 in the simplest possible way, by trying to conquer their neigh-\nbours in the name of unification. They try to streamline all our\nmultifarious thought-forms into unity by drilling them into vari-\nous formal hierarchies.\nAs Rose points out, however, the plurality of thought-forms is\nnot a luxury. It mirrors real complexity in the world. Explanations\ntake different forms because we need to answer many different\nkinds of question, and \u201cthe reason for asking the question will de-\ntermine the most useful type of answer\u201d (p. 14). Even within bi-\nology itself, many quite different kinds of question arise, simply\nbecause life is such a complex phenomenon. Ecology, ethology,\nand developmental biology ask their own distinctive kinds of ques-\ntion, often large ones. It is not sensible to treat these questions as\nsomehow less scientific than those of genetics or neurology and to\ntry to reduce them to those sciences.\nIf, however, we accept this plurality of questions, with the vari-\nety of methods for answering that it demands, we see that biology\nas a whole \u2013 indeed science as a whole \u2013 could never be, and is\nnot meant to be, the kind of single vast, elegant, infallible, monis-\ntic calculation that unifying rationalists have visualised. It must al-\nways be a fallible co-operative enterprise, an ongoing, fluid, prag-\nmatic compromise between many points of view. Those many\npoints of view, if taken seriously, give us a far better understand-\ning of the complex world around us than we could hope to get from\nany formally unified study.\nAll this is no disaster. It simply repeats what every working sci-\nentist knows about the difficulties of unifying knowledge: that\nthere is a constant dialectic between the unifications of theory and\nthe complexity of the facts, a dialectic which must never be al-\nlowed to degenerate into outright conquest. In fact, it only means\nthat science is, after all, a human institution. That is why the dream\nof a tidy omniscience was unrealistic and never needed. That is\nwhy, as Rose puts it, \u201cfar from being determined, or needing to in-\nvoke some non-material concept of free will to help us escape the\ndeterminist trap, it is in the nature of living systems to be radically\nindeterminate, to continually construct their \u2013 our \u2013 own futures,\nalbeit in circumstances not of our own choosing\u201d (p. 7).\nWe live, then, in a world too complex to be investigated by any\nsingle method, one in which no single form of order determines\nwhat will happen. Though living things are in many ways orderly\nand intelligible to us, each of them is a unique individual with its\nown tendencies and is also subject to the constant play of chance.\nComplete predictability is not, even in principle, possible or nec-\nessary. \u201cIt is just this combination of predictability and unpre-\ndictability that distinguishes living systems and processes from the\nmuch simpler events that form the terrain of the sciences of\nphysics and chemistry\u201d (p. 154). That is why we must use \u201ca per-\nspective on biology which transcends genetic reductionism, by\nplacing the organism, rather than the gene, at the centre of life\u201d\n(p. x).\nRose is surely right. This conceptual shift is indeed overdue.\nNOTES\n1. Please send correspondence to IA Collingwood Terrace, Newcastle\non Tyne NE2 2JP, United Kingdom.\n2. Karl Popper (1972) Of clocks and clouds.

However, such trends are probably tem-\nporary aberrations in the development of science. Another form of deter-\nminism which has deeper roots is emerging from modern studies of brain\ndynamics. To reconcile this evidence with the concept of a \u201cperson\u201d will\nrequire more radical rethinking of our received notion of natural law.\nSteven Rose\u2019s Lifelines is a critique of modern biological sciences,\naimed particularly at the reductionism and determinism which\nprevails today in many areas of research and popular science writ-\ning. Rose\u2019s underlying philosophy is Marxist and therefore mate-\nrialist. Although I do not share either of these perspectives (Miller\n1995), I have much sympathy for his critique of modern biology.\nAmongst the areas of research emphasised in Rose\u2019s book is psy-\nchiatric genetics. I recently studied the evidence on the genetics\nof schizophrenia and was shocked by the naivete of molecular ge-\nnetic studies of schizophrenia. Traditional psychiatric genetics has\nproduced abundant evidence that mental disorders such as schiz-\nophrenia are in part determined genetically. This evidence points\nstrongly to the view that many (perhaps very many) genetic fac-\ntors are involved. Probably the genetic aspects of the disorder are\nrelatively rare combinations of many individual genes, all of which\nare common, and in themselves probably quite benign. In molec-\nular psychiatric genetics, however, the goal is usually to find \u201cthe\ngene\u201d or \u201cgenes of major influence.\u201d This search, on which vast re-\nsources have been lavished, seems to assume that schizophrenia is\na clearly defined category, so that it can be defined genetically in\nterms of one or a very few genetic factors. This betrays gross ig-\nnorance \u2013 both of the large body of evidence about schizophrenia\nfavouring a dimensional rather than a categorical definition for the\ndisorder, and of the traditional psychiatric genetics. Its implicit as-\nsumption \u201cone gene \u2013 one psychological characteristic\u201d or \u201cone\ngene \u2013 one diagnosis\u201d seems very similar to the underlying as-\nsumption of phrenology, and is not much more sophisticated con-\nceptually. This work certainly fits well into Rose\u2019s critique of re-\nductionism and determinism.\nRose also suggests that the trends in modern biology have an\nideological basis. My views on this are complex, but in partial\nagreement. On the one hand, there are many contradictions in\nmodern times which suggest that modern biology does not have\nany coherent ideological driving force. For instance, biology now\ntends to emphasise determinism, in curious contrast with other as-\npects of the contemporary world view that emphasise individual-\nity, free enterprise, and personal responsibility. On the other hand,\nprevailing ideas about Darwinism or ultra-Darwinism do have\ntheir main impact not in terms of any obvious technological ad-\nvance, but in promoting a view of human beings as genetic ma-\nchines in competition. This view could be regarded as ideological.\nI take all this to represent the fundamentalisms of our times; in\nthirty years time (one hopes) we will look back on the 1990s with\namazement that scientists could have fallen for such crass atti-\ntudes. Thus the reductionism and determinism Rose criticizes\nmay be a temporary aberration, not part of the main stream of sci-\nentific thought going back to the Renaissance.\nIn passing, Rose also regrets the fact that the physical sciences\nare taken as models for biology. In this he may be mistaken. The\nachievements of Galileo and Newton cannot be simply regarded\nas intellectual developments determined by the socio-cultural de-\nmands of their time. They provided us with the historic hypothe-\nsis that natural laws are a more fundamental description of the\nworld than those based on final causes; they also provide a frame-\nwork for quantitative description of the world based on mass,\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 901\nlength, and time (with some elaborations added later). This de-\nscriptive language is quite fundamental to the scientific enter-\nprise.\nThe notion of natural law was at first a tentative hypothesis.\nHowever, in the centuries after Newton, it has become a dogma,\nto which it seems (especially in biology) there can nowadays be no\nexception. This leads to two major points, one relating to reduc-\ntionism, the other to determinism.\nThe term \u201creductionism\u201d refers to two rather different types of\nexplanatory arguments. The type criticised by Rose arises in part\nfrom a certain type of experimental design. The explanatory argu-\nments which follow, such as they are, are often unsatisfactory be-\ncause the higher-level phenomena to be explained are simplified\nto the point of caricature, rather than being considered in more\nrealistic detail. Rose\u2019s book stresses the dynamic complexity of liv-\ning things, which is not seen until one manages to avoid the over-\nsimplification produced by reductionist experimental designs.\nNevertheless, within this complexity, a second, much better\ntype of explanatory argument can be constructed, crossing be-\ntween levels of description, such as some of those found in physics.\nExamples from physics include the hypothesis of atoms, based on\nthe weight- or volume-ratios of combining substances, or the ex-\nplanation of the gas laws in terms of the dynamics of colliding gas\nmolecules. Similar kinds of explanation in biophysics are those of\nHodgkin\/Huxley relating the action potential to ionic fluxes. Ex-\nplanations of this types are now also becoming possible for higher\nbrain functions, thereby crossing between the neurobiological and\nthe psychological levels, even for the human brain. Admittedly, in\nbrain biology, such explanations often need to be framed in a\nsomewhat different manner. They rely more on informal argu-\nments and comprehensive scholarship than on elegant mathe-\nmatical demonstrations. In addition, it is necessary to \u201cbuild up\u201d\nfrom what is actually known at the lower level, as well as to \u201cbuild\ndown\u201d from what is known at the higher level, in order to frame\nexplanations which cross between levels. Nevertheless, the prin-\nciple of cross-level explanation is the same as in physics. When it\nis successful in brain biology, it is at the same time reductionist and\nholistic and does more justice to the complexity of the high-level\nphenomena to be explained than accounts which simply look for\nlower level explanations of what one observes, or the simplistic\n\u201creductionism\u201d criticized by Rose.\nArising from this second type of explanation, is a variety of\nneural determinism based on much more robust science; the\ngrowing field of forebrain neurodynamics. This offers a much\nmore solidly based determinism, deriving directly from the bio-\nphysics of single nerve cells, and their coming together as cell as-\nsemblies. This work is likely to be more enduring, and more diffi-\ncult to shrug off as a temporary aberration. If we take the concept\nof natural law as a dogma, a principle to which there can be no ex-\nceptions, this work on neural dynamics is implicitly undermining\nthe concept of a person in a far more fundamental way than does\nthe science Rose decries. The concept of a person, though not a\nscientific one, is very important, arguably more so than the scien-\ntific enterprise itself. Hence we should try to find a way to escape\nfrom the apparent determinism of modern brain dynamics. To do\nthis, we need to re-examine our notion of causality, and to reclaim\nthe idea of natural law as a tentative hypothesis, rather than as a\nrigid law to which there can be no exceptions.\nThe implications of this would be profound. In the early days of\nRenaissance science, when the idea of natural law was a tentative\nhypothesis, there were no attempts to provide scientific explana-\ntions of history. This only came later (in the years leading up to the\nFrench revolution). As natural law became a dogma, theories be-\ncame more confident and attempted to explain history as well as\nthe here-and-now, or what was seen in the laboratory. If we are to\nreclaim the idea of natural law as a tentative hypothesis rather than\nthe Orthodox Dogma of our present Brave New World, to which\nwe must all subscribe, we will need to re-examine the status of ar-\nguments purporting to provide scientific explanations of history.\nThis includes both Darwinism and Marxism.\nFacing complexity: Against scientific\noversimplification\nGuenther Palm\nDepartment of Neural Information Processing, University of Ulm, D-89069\nUlm, Germany. palm@neuro.informatik.uni-ulm.de\nAbstract: Steven Rose\u2019s book is essentially a plea for considering the va-\nriety and complexity of life and against simplistic reductions of human and\nanimal behavioral phenomena to single genetic causes.\nLifelines by Steven Rose is interesting and entertaining to read. It\ncovers many areas of biology ranging from molecular biology to\ngenetics and development. But first and foremost, the author has\na definite case and argues for it. The main targets of the book are\n(1) simple genetic determinism, according to which our prospects\nin life are determined by our genes, and (2) a simplistic under-\nstanding of reductionism according to which all of biology and\neven human sociology can ultimately be reduced to the physics of\nthe molecules and atoms we are composed of. I strongly sympa-\nthize with most of the arguments in the book, but I am less happy\nwith some of the philosophical overtones and some exaggerations\nwhich show that the author is sometimes a little too eager to have\nan argument with other scientists. For example, I must admit that\nI enjoyed reading Dawkins\u2019s \u201cThe selfish gene\u201d about as much as\nthis book; I did not see Dawkins as guilty of the scientific over-\nsimplifications about \u201cgay genes\u201d and the like that are the main\ntarget of Rose\u2019s book and that are apparently gaining ground in\nsome scientific communities and even in the prestigious unspe-\ncialized journals Science and Nature.\nI was also unaware of the magnitude of the danger to our hu-\nman self-esteem and the potential sociopolitical consequences of\nthese ideas. Being trained in mathematics and cybernetics, I used\nto consider it obvious that assuming that biological phenomena\ncan eventually be reduced to chemical or even to physical phe-\nnomena does not mean reducing biology to chemistry and chem-\nistry to physics, simply because of the enormous increase in com-\nplexity that one faces in trying to explain higher level phenomena\nin lower level terms. It is mainly in order to deal with the enor-\nmous complexity of living beings that we still need all the scien-\ntific disciplines from physics to biology. Hence, I would still de-\nfend reductionism (and also determinism) in properly construed\nform. I also think simplicity is perhaps the most important crite-\nrion for good science. Trying to see how far we can get by assum-\ning the simplest laws to hold everywhere and always and allowing\nfor exceptions and complications only when forced by the facts has\nbrought us far and has proved to be a sound methodological prin-\nciple. But its success may primarily be due to the simplicity of our\nminds rather than the world we are trying to understand. Thus a\nstatement like \u201cnature is simple\u201d may be right as a methodologi-\ncal principle, but it may be false as a factual statement about \u201cna-\nture.\u201d\nI used to believe that all of this was more or less equally clear\nto many if not most scientists, but after reading the examples given\nby Rose (in particular in the second half of the book) I have\nchanged my opinion on this point. Moreover, I have myself expe-\nrienced how hard it is to convey these basic ideas to a journalist\nwho firmly beliefs in the ultimate truth of science and wants a\nspectacular story. Having read this book one realizes the danger\nof this process and the potential damage it can do to our self-\nimage and thereby to our social relations. The public misconcep-\ntion of the underlying philosophy of science regarding the tenta-\ntiveness of scientific hypotheses tends to lead to an overestimation\nof scientific results and an almost religious belief in science. This\nis particularly dreadful in scientific statements concerning human\nnature and social affairs. It is rather a methodological scientific as-\nsumption than a scientific result, for example, that we have no\nfreedom of will. More concrete examples of such overinterpreta-\ntions concern the localization of schizophrenia or homosexuality\nin one brain region or in one gene. The most imminent danger of\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n902 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nfalse beliefs in such simple \u201cscientific\u201d explanations that reduce\nsocial, environmental, and biological complexities to the safe play-\nground of single causes and physical laws is that they prevent us\nfrom facing complexity. And it is high time to face it, that is, to de-\nvelop methods and intuitions to deal with complex situations.\nExtrapolated lifelines\nT. E. Rowell\nDepartment of Integrative Biology, University of California at Berkeley,\nBerkeley, CA 94720. thelma@ingleton.demon.co.uk\nAbstract: Extending lifelines still further, beyond determinism leads to\ndoubt about females\u2019 ability to select mates with \u201cgood genes,\u201d and to a\nscenario for troop selection and to a link with questions of scale in ecology.\nMy first, and main, response to Lifelines is to raise a cheer; any\ncounterattack against the overwhelmingly fashionable \u201ca gene for\neverything\u201d paradigm is to be welcomed. That it should come\nfrom Rose, an undeniably successful reductionist in his research\nmethods, should give it more power and durability. We can but\nhope that the accessible style of the book will allow its message to\nbe taken into the political arenas where decisions are now being\nmade on the basis of the attractively simple-seeming molecular\ngenetical explanations of life.\nI should like to follow up and extend a couple of lines of thought\nstarted by reading Lifelines. The first led me to reconsider mate\nchoice, recently an extremely fashionable topic in behaviour jour-\nnals, and brought up by Rose in Chapter 7. [See also Buss: \u201cSex-\nDifferences in Human Mate Preferences\u201d BBS 12(1) 1989; Ken-\nrick & Keefe: \u201cAge Preferences in Mates Reflect Sex Differences\nin Human Reproductive Strategies\u201d BBS 15(1) 1992; Rushton:\n\u201cGenetic Similarity, Human Altruism, and Group Selection\u201d BBS\n12(3) 1989, Ed.] On what basis might a female mammal select a\nmate, given that, in most cases, he offers no parental help, but\nmerely genes? Recent studies have assumed that females \u201cselect\nfor good genes,\u201d but what does that mean? The males offering\nthemselves for selection have survived to maturity, which means,\nin elephant seals and many monkeys, for example, that they are\n10\u201312 years old. Clearly none of their genotypes is dysfunctional,\nsimply because they have survived so long. But, is that splendid\nspecimen evidence of a lucky couple of good seasons while he was\na juvenile, or of some genetic advantage? And conversely, is that\nrather bedraggled male one who, because of his superior geno-\ntype, has been able to survive challenges which would have killed\na lesser being? The phenotypes among which the female should\nchoose are the result of such a lengthy interaction with the envi-\nronment that reading the genetic contribution is surely impos-\nsible.\nIn any case, on offer is a more or less random selection of half\nthe male\u2019s genes, which may or may not find a congenial environ-\nment in the genetic and cytoplasmic contribution of this particu-\nlar female. Logically, it seems very doubtful that a valid selection\n\u201cfor good genes\u201d can be made. A female, to be on the safe side,\nshould avoid a sick-seeming male, because it might be infectious.\nShe should on the whole prefer older males, because they have\nsurvived longer. And it would be as well to mate with several\nmales, in case the first is infertile and so causes her to waste a\nwhole breeding season. Apart from those considerations, and\nhurtful though it may be to the male ego, whom she mates with is\na matter of practical indifference to her.\nThere is some evidence that females may in fact follow these\nsimple rules-of-thumb. Most male secondary sexual characters\nbecome more pronounced with age: the antlers of deer get larger\neach mating season, the tail of a peacock becomes longer and the\neyes more numerous (Petrie et al. 1991). Females thus have evi-\ndence of relative age, and are frequently observed to choose older\nmales (while on a longer evolutionary time scale, of course there\nis pressure on the males for earlier development of these traits and\nhence for their increase in ultimate size). Careful observation of\noestrous females under natural conditions, even those that seem\nat first sight to be controlled or sequestered by males, frequently\nreveals promiscuous mating (e.g., Cords et al. 1986).\nThe second line of thought concerns emergent properties of in-\nteracting systems, introduced by Rose in Chapter 4. While Rose\nonly took this to the level of the emergent properties of the 4-\ndimensional individual organism, it can be carried further. Best\nknown, perhaps, is Hinde\u2019s (1974) description of how the ex-\nchange of a series of communicative gestures between two indi-\nviduals makes a social interaction; from a series of interactions\nover time emerges a relationship between the pair; and from the\nnetwork of pairwise relationships between a group of animals\nemerges an organised social group. [See Bernstein: \u201cDominance\u201d\nBBS 4(3) 1991, Ed.] Such a group, or herd, or troop interacts as a\nunit with its environment. Appropriate questions can be asked of\nthe system at each of these levels, and they cannot be answered at\nlower or higher levels \u2013 they simply make no sense except at their\nappropriate level.\nThe level of cooperation and coordination among members of\na troop will, to a large extent, determine its success at exploiting\nits environment and defending itself against predators. A preda-\ntor perceives the troop as an entity which, depending on the de-\ngree of coordination within it, is either worth stalking, or better\nabandoned in favour of less well defended neighbours. Although\nit will be an individual that the predator eats, selection thus acts\non the behavior of the troop, to which each individual contributes.\nThe selection on the individual is for cooperative behaviour within\nits troop. Note that this troop selection, which acts on animals liv-\ning together who need not be related, nor are a closed inter-\nbreeding unit, is not the same as group selection, which is a con-\nstruct of population genetics concerned with closed, or almost\nclosed demes. [See Wilson & Sober: \u201cReintroducing Group Se-\nlection to the Human Behavioral Sciences\u201d BBS 17(4) 1994, Ed.]\nThis line of thought also leads on beyond intra-specific interac-\ntions to ecological questions: Allen and Starr (1982) consider hi-\nerarchy of scale in space and time, showing that questions are only\nrelevant, and can only be asked, at the appropriate level; reduc-\ntionism can in this case lead quite literally to failing to see the\nwood for the trees. Their book makes an excellent companion to\nthe one under review.\nPsychology and sociology: Beyond \nneither determinism nor science\nCarmi Schooler\nSection on Socio-environmental Studies, National Institute of Mental Health,\nBethesda MD 20892-9005. carmi.schooler@nih.gov\nAbstract: While agreeing with Rose\u2019s reasoning about why the causes of\norganisms\u2019 behaviors cannot be reduced to the solely biological and mo-\nlecular, this review questions Rose\u2019s uses of the terms \u201cdeterminism\u201d and\n\u201ccontingency\u201d; his occasional seemingly cavalier acceptance as fact of un-\nproven hypotheses about social and psychological phenomena; and his\ngeneral disdain for the psychometric tradition and its causal modeling ex-\ntensions.\nTo someone whose research crosses the macro-level, molar fields\nof sociology and psychology, it is gratifying to see a distinguished\nresearcher on molecular mechanisms of cognition write a book\nthat presents strong arguments against solely reductionist views of\nbehavior. Rose\u2019s arguments stressing the importance of different\nlevels of phenomena in causing behavior should give pause to the\napparent stampede to explain all human function in extreme re-\nductionist terms. I find Rose\u2019s critique of ultra-Darwinists con-\nvincing, although my relevant expertise is limited. Where I am\nmore entitled to an opinion, I generally agree with his criticism of\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 903\nsociobiology and find Rose\u2019s much needed description of the lim-\nitations of heritability estimates generally on target. His admoni-\ntion constantly to bear in mind the full implications of gene\/envi-\nronment interaction are well taken.\nOne is left with two kinds of qualms:\n(1) There can be some concern that all of Rose\u2019s views should\nnot be summarily dismissed because some of them are taken as\nsoft-headed or overstated;\n(2) Rose\u2019s occasional display of scientific arrogance toward psy-\nchology and sociology in what may be a byproduct of doing re-\nductionist science (even if for methodological rather than ideo-\nlogical reasons).\nThe first set of qualms center on Rose\u2019s use of the term \u201cdeter-\nminism.\u201d Given Rose\u2019s theoretical reasoning and empirical exam-\nples, there seems to be no problem if what is meant by the book\u2019s\nsubtitle \u201cBiology beyond determinism\u201d is that an organism\u2019s de-\nvelopment is not solely determined by its genes and its behavior\nby its biological characteristics. On the other hand, if one truly be-\nlieves, as Rose appears to, that other levels of phenomena also af-\nfect an organism\u2019s behavior, arguing that not all is biology does not\nmake that organism\u2019s behavior any less fully determined. Nor do\nthe effects of contingency make it any less determined. For Rose,\n\u201ccontingency\u201d has several meanings. One is that causal patterning\nmay be extremely complex and diffuse. Another concerns our dif-\nficulty in measuring a particular event or process whose effects are\nrelevant. A third is the spatio-temporal conjunction of previously\nseparated processes that then jointly affect the organism. None of\nthese forms of contingency makes the way the organism changes\nor responds any less determined.\nDifferences in connotation between the terms \u201cchange\u201d and\n\u201crespond\u201d suggest another questionable way Rose sees organisms\nas somehow being beyond determinism. \u201cChange\u201d implies that\nthe object or organism being acted upon is relatively passive, that\nis, the movement of a billiard ball after being hit is calculable as a\ndirect function of the forces acting upon it. The way of striking the\ncue ball, however, is a function of the player\u2019s response to the de-\nmands of the situation, a response that involves not only physical\nabilities and state, but also motivation, knowledge of the game,\nand ability to plan for the future. Still, these characteristics are a\ndirect function of the player\u2019s past history as embodied at the in-\nstant of striking the ball. Since it is not completely determined \nby the immediate external environment, this active, and indeed\nproactive, response might be seen as beyond determinism. Nev-\nertheless, it is completely determined by the player\u2019s history.\nThis description of the determinacy of the billiard player\u2019s re-\nsponse probably accords with Rose\u2019s own views. He sees \u201cbiology\nas history\u201d (p. 18). When he describes humans as free agents it is\nin the \u201cMarxist sense of the freedom of necessity\u201d (p. 18). Unfor-\ntunately, to a non-Marxist \u201cfreedom of necessity\u201d may seem an\noxymoron, likely to provide only cold comfort to someone who\nbought Rose\u2019s book believing that the subtitle promised a release\nfrom determinism to free will.\nGrounds for my qualms over reductionist arrogance come from\nthe way Rose lists, without citing a single relevant empirical study,\na whole host of psychological and sociological explanations of at-\ntention deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g., relations with parents,\nsize of class in arguing that the theory that the disorder\u2019s cause is\n\u201c\u2018inside\u2019 the child\u2019s brain . . . is almost certainly wholly fallacious\u201d\n(p. 56). Carrying out the relevant studies may be more difficult\nthan counting the pecks of a chick in a meticulously controlled en-\nvironment, but doing so is necessary if our knowledge of human\nbehavior is to go beyond ex cathedra assertions of what appears\nobvious to the asserter. In a similar vein, one is bemused by Rose\u2019s\nbelief (discussion pp. 191\u201392 and n. 17, p. 206) that he would\nlearn much by inspecting the primary data of Bouchard\u2019s (Bou-\nchard et al. 1990) twin research. Only someone trained in the psy-\nchometric and related statistical techniques that Rose apparently\ndisdains can appropriately appraise the research in question.\nMore generally, one is bothered by Rose\u2019s consistent linkage \nof racism, genetic studies, and the psychometric methodology.\nGranted, he has much history on his side. Nevertheless, doing\ntwin studies is no proof of racism. Neither is respect for the ac-\ncomplishments of the psychometric tradition and its extensions\ninto causal modelling of non-experimental data. The one of Rose\u2019s\nobjections to heritability studies that is off-the-mark is his con-\ntention that the relevant psychological and environmental vari-\nables are not measurable. Mine is admittedly the perspective of\nsomeone who, with the aim of assessing the psychological effects\nof environmental conditions, has spent much of his career devel-\noping rigorous psychometric measure of such psychological char-\nacteristics as job satisfaction, self-esteem, and intellectual func-\ntioning. These measure are valid indicators of the individual\u2019s\npsychological functioning in a particular time and situation. By\nthemselves they say nothing about what the individual would be\nlike in other times and situations. They do, however, provide a\nmeans of modeling development, stability, and change in the in-\ndividual\u2019s psychological functioning.\nI have been equally involved in developing statistically rigorous\nmeasures of environmental conditions, such as the substantive\ncomplexity of work. On mathematical grounds, it is even more im-\nportant to get accurate measures of independent environmental\nvariables than dependent psychological ones, especially if we want\nto compare the magnitudes of the psychological effects environ-\nmental variables with the magnitudes of biological ones (presum-\nably measured accurately). If we are to take seriously Rose\u2019s con-\ncern for how individuals are affected by different aspects of their\nenvironments, the measurement of environmental variables and\ntheir effects should not be left to armchair speculation.\nWhy twin studies really don\u2019t tell us much\nabout human heritability\nSidney J. Segalowitz\nDepartment of Psychology, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario L2S 3A1\nCanada. ssegalow@brocku.ca\nAbstract: The derivation of heritability from human twin studies involves\nserious methodological flaws. Heritability is consistently overestimated\nbecause of biological confounds of twinning, consistent and often gross\nunderestimation of the environmental variance, and nonadditive genetic\ninfluences that can hugely exaggerate heritability values. Despite this bad\nresearch design, behaviour geneticists continue to publish results imply-\ning that their heritability results are valid.\nGenetic factors clearly influence human development. What is\ncontested is the nature of this influence (the focus of Lifelines) and\nits extent. In theory, one can obtain a measure of the degree to\nwhich variations in a trait across individuals are attributable to \ngenetic variations in the population. Twin studies provide the\nstrongest support for genetic sources of this variation in traits. The\ncommonly used metric is heritability, which is derived from the in-\ncrease in correlation in the trait of interest in monozygotic twins\n(MZ) compared with dizygotic twins (DZ). Rose dismisses this\nmethodology because the assumptions of the heritability model\nare not met in human studies (pp. 188\u201393). There are several\ngood reasons for this dismissal, although he singles out primarily\nstatistical assumptions. Unfortunately, behavioural scientists are\nin the habit of ignoring problems of statistical assumptions, and as-\nsume that replication and large sample sizes will validate prob-\nlematic results in the end. The research design problems of twin\nstudies are much more severe than this, however, being ones of\nsystematic bias, inflating heritability values. These overestimates\nof heritability are due to at least three research design faults:\n1. Biological confounds. In an MZ\u2013DZ twin study, the only\ndifference between the twin types is supposedly the extent of\ngenotypic similarity. However, two-thirds of MZ twins also share\nthe same placenta and chorion whereas no DZ twins do (Phelps\net al. 1997). MZ twins who share a chorion are significantly more\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n904 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nsimilar on a variety of personality and cognitive measures than\nthose that do not (Sokol et al. 1995). This should not be surpris-\ning, for by sharing a chorion, MZ twins also share blood supply, a\nvariety of early hormonal influences, and even infections and im-\nmune status (which may account for higher concordance rates of\nschizophrenia in MZ compared to DZ twins; Phelps et al. 1997).\nThus, MZ twins share other long-lasting developmental factors\nbesides DNA similarity. This reinforces the notion of early bio-\nlogical factors influencing psychological development, but the ge-\nnetic attribution is exaggerated.\n2. Consistent underestimation of environmental variance. In\ntwin studies, environmental variation between the members of the\ntwin pairs is always an underestimate of society\u2019s range. If every\nindividual were to receive exactly the same environment, then all\nvariation in a trait would have to be attributed to genotypic dif-\nferences (and genotype 3 environment interactions). To the ex-\ntent that environmental separation of adoptive twins is less than\nthat between twin pairs, the heritability is higher. But adoption\nagencies never give children to families in abject poverty (because\ntheir mandate is the best interests of the child), much less sepa-\nrate twins across such an advantaged\/impoverished spectrum.\nThey have even matched adoptive home religion for twin pairs.\nThus, the cultural distance between twin members must be con-\nsiderably less than that available in the society as a whole. Add to\nthis the fact that the large twin studies (those in Minnesota and in\nSweden) follow up adopted twins in relatively homogeneous soci-\neties (where well-developed health agencies and medical records\nare available). The thought experiment of separating twins at birth\nto widely different settings \u2013 for example, one to urban New York,\nthe other to rural Sahara; one to an affluent home in London, the\nother to a poor family in the third world \u2013 illustrates how heri-\ntability is artificially raised by restrictions of environmental vari-\nance. Indeed, Bronfenbrenner (1975) showed that the correlation\nin IQ between twins, which is normally .85, drops to .26 with twins\nwhose adoptive families live in different communities (e.g., min-\ning versus agricultural). Thus, potential environmental variance is\nvastly underestimated and therefore heritability is necessarily\noverestimated.\n3. Nonadditive genetic influences. Heritability is mathemati-\ncally based on the notion of additive genetic components \u2013 the\nmore similar genes two individuals have the more similar their\ntrait outcome will be. What happens, however, if genetically influ-\nenced traits are nonadditive, such as when a complete pattern of\ngenes influences the trait rather than the genes individually? We\nare used to nonadditivity in traits, such as the attractiveness of a\nface. Having a nice nose and chin with the wrong mouth and eyes\ndoes not bring the face halfway to beauty. In twin studies, when\nMZ twins are so much more similar to each other than are DZ\ntwins that heritability comes out to over 100%, which is non-\nsensical, we conclude that the genetic contribution is nonadditive\n(Lykken et al. 1992). [See also Wahlsten: \u201cInsensitivity of the\nAnalysis of Variance to Heredity\u2013Environment Interaction\u201d BBS\n13(1) 1990.] In the extreme case, DZ can have a zero correlation\nand MZ a 100% correlation, making heritability 200%. In such a\ncase, the heritability model must be rejected. Unfortunately, every\ntrait measured by a behaviour geneticist can be conceived as be-\ning a high-level product of many subtraits, some of which may\nhave nonadditive genetic aspects, others not. Nonadditive factors\nwill add enormously exaggerated heritability components (up to\nthe maximum of 200%). Since we have no independent measures\nof the heritability for the subcomponents, there is no way to quan-\ntify the overestimation of heritability.\nFor these three reasons (and others), heritability derived from\ntwin studies is always inflated, and replicating the twin studies will\nonly replicate the error. It is not surprising that composite traits\nsuch as IQ have a high heritability\u2013gene similarity in twin studies\nis confounded with prenatal health and environment, reduced en-\nvironmental variation in twin-adoptive families, and some of the\nsubtraits related to IQ probably have nonadditive components.\nThus, we cannot find a value for the genetic heritability of traits\nfrom twin studies, although we clearly accept that genes influence\n(in some complex way) nervous system growth. The most that twin\nstudies can tell us is the upper limit of true heritability, not an ab-\nsolute value that is to be believed.\nHierarchical approach to replication \nand selection\nAlexei A. Sharov\nDepartment of Entomology, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0319.\nsharov@vt.edu www.gypsymoth.ento.vt.edu\/~sharov\/alexei.html\nAbstract: The major merit of Rose\u2019s book is the elaboration of the idea of\nmultilevel causation in different explanatory languages. Yet Rose\u2019s critique\nof \u201cultra-Darwinism\u201d is not convincing. Rose argues that activity and self-\nreplication are properties of organisms rather than genes, which contra-\ndicts his idea of multilevel causation. Also, Rose fails to develop the con-\ncept of multilevel selection.\nContemporary biology is essentially reductionistic in its attempt\nto collapse the entire hierarchy of living systems to the molecular\nlevel. Rose defends the idea of hierarchy. In particular, he \ncriticizes the view of Dawkins (1976; 1978), labeled \u201cultra-\nDarwinism,\u201d that evolution occurs at the level of genes rather than\norganisms.\nRose considers systems at each level as semi-independent\nagents. The interaction between hierarchical levels occurs\nthrough the process of development. Hence the title of the book,\nLifelines, which means developmental trajectories of organisms.\nThe novelty of Rose\u2019s approach is that each level of the hierarchy\nis viewed as a distinct language for describing things at a specific\nscale. One language can be partially translated into another, but\nthere is always an untranslatable residual. This thesis is formulated\nas \u201cone world, many ways of knowing\u201d (p. 304). Notions used in\none area of biology change their meaning or become useless when\napplied to another area. For example, the notion of gene changes\nits meaning as we change scale from organism to chromosomes\nand then to DNA molecules.\nLiving systems do not exist in isolation from their environment.\nBut isolation is necessary to perform experiments. This contradic-\ntion is resolved by using a hierarchy of isolations. We can isolate an\nRNA molecule and determine the sequence of its nucleotides. But\nin isolation from the cell we will never observe the function of this\nmolecule. Thus, boundaries of living systems are fuzzy.\nAccording to Rose, ultra-Darwinism is based on the idea that\n\u201cthe purpose (telos) of life is reproduction, reproduction of the\ngenes embedded in the \u2018lumbering robots\u2019 which constitute living\norganisms\u201d (p. 209). But Dawkins (1986) denies any purpose of\nlife as well as any other purposes in Nature; this is the major idea\nof his \u201cblind watchmaker\u201d metaphor. The next statement of ultra-\nDarwinism, according to Rose, is that \u201cEvery observable aspect of\nthe phenotype of an organism . . . is in some way adaptive\u201d\n(p. 210). As evidence of the role of chance in evolution he men-\ntions neutral evolution, strange fossils found at the Burgess Shale,\nand the role of developmental constraints (photoreceptors in the\neye have a backward orientation). Unfortunately, Figure 8.2 shows\nHallucinogenia (an animal from the Burgess Shale) upside down.\nThe second row of its legs was initially missing, and thus, first re-\nconstructions were misleading (Ramskold 1992). After flipping\nthe image, it becomes similar to Onychophora. But Dawkins never\ndenied the role of chance in evolution. He wrote about neutral\nevolution and photoreceptors in the eye (Dawkins 1986). The only\ndifference is that he considers neutral evolution a \u201cboring part\u201d\n(p. 303) of evolutionary theory.\nThe line of demarcation between the views of Dawkins and\nRose lies in their answer to the question: Which are active, genes\nor organisms? Dawkins (1986) thinks that the real agents are genes\nwho collectively build an organism, which is a mechanism for gene\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 905\nduplication. In contrast, Rose thinks that organisms are active,\nwhereas genes are passive tools used by organisms to transfer in-\nformation. He writes that DNA is not a self-replicating molecule\nas claimed by Dawkins because it cannot build its copy in isolation\nfrom the cell. Not even viruses are considered self-replicating or\nactive because they require a host cell to replicate.\nThis discussion appears pointless if we think in terms of multi-\nlevel causation. If hierarchical levels are partially independent,\nthen activity can be found at various levels, including genes and\norganisms. Self-replication is impossible in any isolated system,\nnot only in the isolated gene. Somebody might argue then that any\nmaterial thing can be considered a self-replicator simply because\nit can be copied by humans. This logic is based on extreme cases\n(complete isolation or no isolation) and ignores the hierarchy of\nisolations.\nOne of Rose\u2019s key statements is that \u201cthe individual gene is not\nthe only level at which selection occurs\u201d (p. 215). It is not clear\nhow this is compatible with his claim that genes do not self-\nreplicate. Although I entirely accept the idea of multi-level selec-\ntion, the arguments presented by Rose are not convincing. He\nconsiders the fact that \u201cany individual gene can be expressed only\nagainst the background of the whole of the rest of the genome\u201d\n(p. 216) as evidence of selection at the level of organisms. But\nDawkins (1986) did not deny interaction between genes. He\nwrote: \u201cthe whole process of embryonic development can be\nlooked upon as a cooperative venture, jointly run by thousands of\ngenes together\u201d (p. 170). He then adds: \u201cBut from each gene\u2019s\npoint of view, perhaps the most important part of its environment\nis all the other genes that it encounters . . . Each gene is selected\nfor its capacity to cooperate successfully with the population of\nother genes that it is likely to meet in bodies\u201d (p. 170). All effects\nof genes at various levels (proteins, cells, organisms, societies, and\necosystems) are easily explained by Dawkins (1986) as coopera-\ntion among genes. Thus, Rose fails to formulate the concept of\nmultiple levels of selection. His major mistake is that he treats se-\nlection at the level of genes as something ontologically different\nfrom selection at the level of organisms. Instead, these are differ-\nent languages for describing basically the same phenomenon.\nThus, the selection of cooperating genes is a legitimate way of de-\nscribing natural selection, but it is not the only possible way. Al-\nthough these languages are mostly compatible, there may be a\npreferred language for handling each particular case. Complete\ngenetic descriptions exist only for a few species of organisms such\nas the fly Drosophila. To analyze the evolution of other species, we\nhave no choice but to remain at the organism level.\nCognitive and psychiatric science \nbeyond determinism\nDan J. Stein\nMRC Research Unit on Anxiety and Stress Disorders, Department of\nPsychiatry, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg 7505, South Africa.\ndjs2@maties.sun.ac.za\nAbstract: Many of Rose\u2019s criticisms of determinism in biology have clear\nrelevance to modern cognitive and psychiatric science; too narrow a focus\non the brain as an information processing machine runs the risk of ne-\nglecting the context in which information processing takes place, and too\nnarrow a focus on the neuroscience of psychopathology runs the risk of \nneglecting other levels of explanation for these phenomena. It should be\nemphasized, however, that animal and genetic studies of phenomena of \ninterest to cognitive and psychiatric science (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disorder,\nschizophrenia, attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, and violence),\nwhile perhaps only providing a partial perspective, may be useful in un-\nderstanding these phenomena and in leading to appropriate psychiatric in-\nterventions.\nIn Lifelines, Steven Rose asserts that in contrast to physics and\nchemistry, biology \u201cis different\u201d (p. 68). \u201cNot only is the living\nworld much more complex and less predictable than the inani-\nmate world studied by physicists and chemists, but biology . . . lays\nclaims to be in a position to tell us, as humans, who we are, where\nwe came from, where we are going, how we must live\u201d (p. 68).\nThus, a central theme of the volume is the folly of reductionism in\nbiological science, and the importance of multiple levels of expla-\nnations of biological phenomena.\nAmong the most \u201cdifferent\u201d (most complex and least pre-\ndictable) fields within biology are the study of human psychology\nand, perhaps even more, of psychopathology. Indeed, as a psychi-\natrist, I could not help but relate many of Rose\u2019s concerns to de-\nvelopments in this field. (Rose too uses a number of examples\nfrom the psychiatric literature.) Modern psychiatry, particularly in\nthe United States, has seen the replacement of a predominantly\npsychodynamic perspective with a \u201cbiological\u201d approach, which\nemphasizes the importance of neuroscience in understanding psy-\nchopathology, with pharmacotherapy as an appropriate interven-\ntion. Among the risks of this approach is failing to see that psychi-\natry is itself a social practice.\nMany of Rose\u2019s criticisms have bearing upon the aspirations of\nbiological psychiatry; too narrow a focus on the neuroscience of\npsychopathology runs the risk of neglecting other levels of expla-\nnation for these phenomena. Several authors, such as McHugh\nand Slavney (1983), have emphasized the importance of different\nkinds of explanation in psychiatry; an important strand of expla-\nnation must, as Rose advises for biology in general, focus on his-\ntory and development. Clearly, any philosophy of science and bi-\nology must address not only mechanism but also meaning (Stein\n1991). Thus, a sudden episode of decompensation in a patient\nwith schizophrenia may require both a biological perspective (the\npatient discontinued medication) and a more psychological one\n(the decision to stop medication took place in the context of fam-\nily conflict over the expense of medical care).\nRose\u2019s criticisms also have bearing on the aspirations of much\nof cognitive science; too narrow a focus on the brain as an infor-\nmation processing machine runs the risk of neglecting the context\nin which information processing takes place. Several authors have\nemphasized the importance of situated cognition as opposed to\nsimply symbolic cognition (Norman 1993); once again, the em-\nphasis of situated cognitivists is, as Rose advises, on matters such\nas agency, meaning, and history. As Rose succinctly puts it (p. 9),\n\u201cNot everything is capable of being captured in a mathematical\nformula.\u201d Indeed, more sophisticated approaches in cognitive sci-\nence (e.g., Lakoff 1987) go well beyond the narrow focus on Pla-\ntonic essences (p. 42) and digital algorithms (p. 121) that Rose crit-\nicizes. Certainly, when it comes to explaining psychopathological\nphenomena, a purely algorithmic approach (for example, parry,\nthe digital model of paranoia; Colby 1981) would do only partial\njustice to the complexity of the matter at hand.\nRose goes one step further, though, arguing that biological re-\nductionism is ascendant, and that it entails an ideology that needs\nto be fought (p. 273). While genetic findings in psychology and\npsychiatry have undoubtedly received a great deal of attention,\nand while the pharmaceutical industry is clearly a powerful one, I\nam unconvinced that neuroscientific approaches to these fields\nare always very widespread (certainly laypersons continue to view\nmental disorders as \u201cdifferent\u201d) or necessarily very evil. Let us\nconsider some specific examples from psychiatry which Rose him-\nself raises: Alzheimer\u2019s disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit\/\nhyperactivity disorder, and violence.\nRose notes that he himself is a neuroscientist interested in\nmemory. He puts forward an argument about the necessity of\n(simplified) animal models of memory, and the possibility that\nthey may have implications for understanding human memory and\nfor intervening in disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s (p. 32). He notes also\nthat in Alzheimer\u2019s only 5% of cases are clearly associated with a\nspecific genetic dysfunction (p. 293). Similarly, any specific mech-\nanism that emerges from a study of animal models may well re-\nquire extension and elaboration before it can be applied to human\nmemory dysfunction. It hardly seems controversial to assert that\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n906 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\na good explanation of Alzheimer\u2019s is going to require an under-\nstanding of the interactions between multiple factors (neurosci-\nentific, psychosocial) involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder;\nit makes sense for a funding agency interested in Alzheimer\u2019s to\nfund studies on the genetics of Alzheimer\u2019s and on animal models\n(such as Rose\u2019s, as well as a range of other approaches). The re-\ncent introduction of specific medications for Alzheimer\u2019s has by no\nmeans provided a cure, but the very fact of their existence pro-\nvides promise for a neuroscientific approach to the disorder.\nHow different is the study of schizophrenia? Rose asserts\n(p. 306) that schizophrenia is a contested area where crucial de-\nterminants may occur at several levels (e.g., neuroscientific, psy-\nchosocial). Certainly, there is good evidence that psychosocial\nvariables influence the course and expression of schizophrenia.\nNevertheless, the field of schizophrenia has moved far beyond the\noutdated notion of the schizophrenogenic mother. As in the study\nof memory and its dsyfunctions (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s), genetic find-\nings and animal models may be extremely helpful in understand-\ning this disorder; an important remaining challenge is to integrate\nthese findings with those from research on psychosocial factors\n(Portin & Alanen 1997; Weinberger 1996). Furthermore, a focus\non the neuroscience of schizophrenia does not necessarily fall \nprey to Rose\u2019s sociopolitical criticisms of reductionism (p. 297) \u2013\n\u201cblaming the victim\u201d and misallocation of resources. It is notable\nthat families of schizophrenia patients have increasingly sup-\nported neuroscientific research on the disorder. Furthermore, the\nintroduction of antipsychotics (and more recently of the atypical\nantipsychotics) have represented dramatic steps forward in the\ntreatment of this major disorder.\nWhat about the study of attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD)? Rose (p. 56) asserts that ADHD is not appreciably\nknown outside the United States and that it is a disorder that may\ndisappear on weekends and holidays. Furthermore, he seems to\nindicate that it is erroneous to think of the disorder as brain-based;\nit is better explained by the relationships of the child to the out-\nside world. Here his argument, which sounds similar to literature\nproduced by the anti-psychiatry movement, runs the risk of a re-\nductionism of a different sort (reduction to the psychosocial).\nWhile psychiatric diagnosis is of course a particular kind of social\npractice (Stein 1991), ADHD is in fact widely recognized and\ntreated outside of the United States (World Health Organization\n1992). Furthermore, although ADHD is clearly complex, genetic\nand biological studies have in fact shed important light on its\npathogenesis (Castellanos 1997). The research demonstrates\nclearly that for a child with ADHD, medication and psychother-\napy interventions are extremely helpful (Shaywitz et al. 1997).\nWhile the theoretical possibility of replacing such individual in-\nterventions with universal changes in school systems no doubt ex-\nists, such a solution runs the risk of \u201cfatuity\u201d (cf. Rose p. 299). (This\nis not of course, to deny that in some cases, where a primary un-\nderlying problem is in fact simply poor parenting or poor school-\ning, children may unfortunately be misdiagnosed as having\nADHD.)\nWhat about the study of violence? Rose appears to be scathing\nabout the possibility of a neuroscientific approach to human vio-\nlence; he picks out Brunner\u2019s study (p. 281) for criticism for arbi-\ntrarily lumping together different kinds of aggressive behavior, is\nwithering about Raine\u2019s studies of PET scanning in murderers\n(p. 290), criticises the extrapolation of animal studies of aggression\nto humans (p. 294), and argues that biological interventions for vi-\nolence would be fatuous (p. 298). Brunner (1996) himself, how-\never, has clearly acknowledged the complexity of aggression and\nviolence. Similarly, Raine (1993; whose work is not listed in Life-\nlines\u2019 references), has emphasized that multiple factors con-\ntribute to criminal behavior, and rather than seeing Prozac as a\npanacea (cf. Rose p. 291) has argued for the importance of psy-\nchosocial interventions. Rose is no doubt right in stressing the\ncomplexity of violent behavior and in noting that interventions\nneed to be primarily psychosocial; and it is certainly important not\nto blame the victim but to allocate funding appropriately (p. 297);\nnevertheless, there is no prima facie reason to avoid animal or \ngenetic studies of aggression as useless or harmful. In addition,\npharmacological interventions are useful for some impulsive and\naggressive psychiatric patients (Coccaro & Kavoussi 1997). Fi-\nnally, although Rose provides a trenchant critique of the excessive\nclaims of some evolutionary psychology (p. 246), evolutionarily in-\nformed approaches to aggression can be sophisticated and rele-\nvant to human behavior (de Waal 1996).\nIf biology is able to succeed in being a good explanatory science,\nthen a \u201cbiological psychiatry\u201d which includes multiple levels of ex-\nplanation is also possible, and will extend this field beyond the all\ntoo common connotation of \u201cbiological psychiatry\u201d as necessarily\nentailing a reductionistic perspective. Rose notes (p. 302) that\nmuch of his thesis is not new; nevertheless, his synthesis is an at-\ntractive and important one. Certainly, when it comes to complex\npsychopathology, there is much evidence \u00e0 la Rose, that under-\nstanding both genetic and historical factors is crucial (Schaffner\n1998); that soma and psyche are interlinked (with successful psy-\nchotherapy resulting in functional brain changes; Baxter et al.\n1992); that biological interventions having multiple psychological\neffects (Kramer 1994); and that explanations of psychopathology\nare themselves rooted in social practices (Kleinman 1988). Any\noversimplification in this area (for example, characterizing psy-\nchiatric disorders solely in terms of neurotransmitter dysfunction,\nor depicting psychiatric disorders as representing simply a \u201cnor-\nmal\u201d response to an \u201cabnormal\u201d environment; Conrad & Schnei-\nder 1980) is bound to be problematic.\nLifelines to a sinking cause\nH. Dieter Steklis\nDepartment of Anthropology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903-\n0270. steklis@rci.rutgers.edu\nAbstract: Rose\u2019s attack on ultra-Darwinists\u2019 and evolutionary psycholo-\ngists\u2019 accounts of human behavior fails, largely because he does not offer\na viable alternative. His \u201clifelines\u201d view of organismic development is es-\nsentially an epigenetic one that few sociobiologists would disagree with,\nRose seeks to disempower genes where human behavior is concerned, de-\nspite contrary neurogenetic evidence and at odds with the implications of\nhis own lifelines view. He attempts to discredit biological determinist ac-\ncounts by suggesting that their research program is politically motivated,\nwhile ignoring the scientific viability and novel insights such research has\nyielded.\nMuch of what Rose says I agree with, so why am I not in his camp,\na defender of his cause, which is to reject the current \u201centhusiasm\nfor biologically determinist accounts of the human condition\u201d? It\nis because Rose does not offer a viable alternative. I want to illus-\ntrate and support this point further by examining Rose\u2019s argu-\nments concerning (1) what genes do; (2) appropriate levels of\ncausal analysis; and (3) science as a mirror of reality.\nWhat genes do. A central tenet of Rose\u2019s anti-determinist ar-\ngument rests on the indeterminate nature of an organism\u2019s genetic\ninstructions, be they coding for the eventual form of proteins,\nneural circuitry, or behavior. In Rose\u2019s view, the reason for the\ngenome\u2019s indeterminacy lies in the dynamic, and essentially un-\npredictable interaction between the developing organism and its\nenvironment, from the cellular environment of the DNA strands\nthemselves to the extracellular environment of developing tissues,\nto the external, postnatal environment of the developing organ-\nism. This dynamic developmental and maturational trajectory of\nan organism Rose calls its \u201clifeline,\u201d a process throughout which\n\u201corganisms . . . and the environment \u2013 all relevant aspects of it \u2013\ninterpenetrate\u201d (p. 140); in other words, an inextricable joining of\nnature and nurture. Thus, although according to Rose, lifelines as\nsuch are \u201cnot embedded in genes\u201d (p. 171), an organism\u2019s imper-\nviousness to \u201cdevelopmental and environmental buffeting\u201d is \u201cin\nthe genes\u201d (p. 306), ensuring normal developmental outcomes in\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 907\nthe face of chance environmental perturbations. To Rose, genes\n\u201care no more and no less than an essential part of the toolkit with\nand by which organisms construct their own futures\u201d (p. 137, em-\nphasis mine). It is, then, in viewing the organism as free to self-\nconstruct, as an active agent in building its lifeline, that Rose parts\ncompany with those who see the organism as a passive entity (as\nin Dawkins\u2019s genetic vehicles) whose structure, form and function\nare predetermined by its DNA.\nBecause Rose\u2019s \u201clifelines\u201d view of organismic development is es-\nsentially an epigenetic one \u2013 the recognition of the fundamental\ninterdependence between organism and environment \u2013 I doubt\nthat any sociobiologist would disagree with him. Rather, disagree-\nment revolves around whether epigenesis excludes a genetic in-\nfluence on behavior or how epigenesis can be said to provide\n\u201cfreedom\u201d from genetic influence. Rose\u2019s final sentence leaves his\ninterpretation of epigenesis unambiguous: \u201cAnd it is therefore our\nbiology that makes us free\u201d (p. 309). Aside from its rhetorical in-\ntent, how are we to interpret this declaration of independence?\nDoes he mean \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of \u201cunconstrained\u201d? Surely not.\nHe does, after all, recognize the process of genetic canalization,\nand, as mentioned earlier, the genome\u2019s contribution to develop-\nmental buffering. The argument then boils down to the meaning\nof constraint.\nThere is nothing in Rose\u2019s \u201clifelines\u201d argument that precludes\nthe standard sociobiologist\u2019s requirement for a genetic influence\n(or constraint) on behavior. We need only pursue two aspects of\nhis \u201clifelines\u201d view to make this clear. One concerns initial condi-\ntions (or constraints) provided by the genome, the other concerns\nthe \u201cinterpenetration\u201d between organism and environment. Re-\ngardless of the \u201cdistance\u201d between genes and behavioral expression,\ngenes (minimally) do specify the initial conditions for the organ-\nism\u2019s lifeline, thereby constraining all subsequent organism-\nenvironment interactions. I assume that Rose would agree that,\nfor the reliable appearance of species-typical characteristics (e.g.,\nbipedality, human language, play), the initial conditions provided\nby the genome (e.g., cellular components and products) must\nsomehow constrain all subsequent organism\u2013environment inter-\nactions. Indeed, it is precisely the departure from such canalized\ndevelopment, as in the fluctuating asymmetry of normally sym-\nmetrical morphology, that interests evolutionary biologists, be-\ncause it suggests (and in some cases has been linked to) genetic\nvariation \u2013 and hence fitness \u2013 in the organism\u2019s ability to with-\nstand the effects of Rose\u2019s \u201cdevelopmental buffeting\u201d (Polak &\nTrivers 1994).\nHow the cascade of developmental events constrains develop-\nmental outcomes is inherent in Rose\u2019s own notion of \u201cinterpene-\ntration\u201d between organism and environment. I\u2019m sure that as a bi-\nologist he would not disagree that from conception to death, each\norganism defines its environment by seeking out or identifying\nand responding selectively to stimuli within it. It follows that each\norganism\u2019s experience is not random (contrary to Rose), and that\nits genome (by initially constraining and setting in motion the de-\nvelopmental trajectory) defines which stimuli are salient, and in\nthis sense constrains the organism\u2019s interaction with its environ-\nment.\nThe field of neurogenetics, of which Rose is critical, supports\nthis view of developmental constraints. Myriad experimental stud-\nies show that the mammalian brain has evolved to both expect and\ndepend on information from the environment not only for its pre-\nadult ontogeny, but also for its adaptive modification in adulthood\n(Greenough 1986). The nervous system appears to \u201canticipate\u201d ex-\nperiential events that have been reliable environmental features\nof the species\u2019 evolutionary history \u2013 its past \u201clifelines\u201d (e.g., the\nprimate mother\u2013infant bond is an evolutionarily reliable environ-\nment that provides \u201cinformation\u201d for the normal development of\nbrain structure, function, and behavior; Hofer 1981). A species\u2019\nevolutionary history thus defines which experiences are salient, at\nwhat time, and in what manner (e.g., see Gottlieb\u2019s 1976 useful\ndistinction between inductive, facilitative, and maintenance ef-\nfects of experience on behavioral and neural maturation). Because\nthe timing and importance of experience for phenotypic expres-\nsion vary among different components of the phenotype, it is\nmeaningless to think of entire organisms, rather than particular\nphenotypic traits, as either \u201cplastic\u201d or \u201cpredetermined\u201d (e.g., de-\npendent on or independent of learning). In humans, for example,\nthe capacity for spontaneous facial expression of emotion emerges\nindependent of visual experience, suggesting that its normal\nemergence is highly constrained. This, however, does not rule out\nthe influence of other forms of experience (e.g., sensory feedback\nfrom facial muscles) on the development of this ability.\nIf Rose pursued the full implications of his concept of organ-\nism\u2013environment \u201cinterpenetration\u201d he would not argue, for ex-\nample, that because the family environment of siblings is similar,\n\u201csimilarities detected between them are inextricably the result of\nboth genes and environment\u201d (p. 190); in other words, that any ge-\nnetic contribution to the behavioral phenotype will be masked by\nthe shared environment. A wealth of studies show that fraternal\ntwins, despite being raised in the same family environment, often\nturn out to be very different in personality and behavior (Plomin\n& Daniels 1987). Indeed, from a comprehensive review of the re-\nsearch literature, Harris (1998, p. 37) concludes that \u201cgrowing up\nin the same home does not make siblings alike.\u201d The likely reason\nfor the failure of the shared environment to produce shared traits\nis that the genetically constrained lifelines of siblings lead them to\nconstruct their \u201cshared\u201d household environments differently.\nFrom the perspective of the self-constructing organism, the envi-\nronment is never truly random or homogeneous.\nAppropriate levels of causal analysis. Rose unjustly condemns\n\u201cultra-Darwinists\u201d for choosing the wrong level of causal behav-\nioral analysis. In discussing human violence, for example, he not\nonly disagrees with neurogeneticists who aver that violence is\ncaused by \u201c\u2018violent\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019 genes,\u201d but also insists that \u201cneu-\nrogenetics is the wrong level . . . at which to find answers to many\nof the problems confronting us\u201d (p. 276\u201377).\nLike Rose\u2019s early example of causal explanations why a frog\njumps, each level of explanation is equally valid and appropriate,\nproviding insight into causation at that level (biochemical,\nanatomical, evolutionary).  A complete causal analysis combines\nall levels, which is basically what the classical ethologists have ad-\nvocated all along in recognizing the complementarity of proximate\nand ultimate causes of behavior. In the case of human violence,\nthe sociological level of causal analysis is no more appropriate than\nthe genetic or biochemical one; all are equally appropriate for a\nfull understanding of why (to use Rose\u2019s example) in the same sit-\nuation some individuals murder while others do not. The socio-\nlogical level of causation would include social stimuli or triggers\n(e.g., poverty or a history of marital infidelity), while the physio-\nlogical level could identify the responsible brain mechanisms (e.g.,\nlow serotonin). One cannot agree more when Rose writes that \u201cthe\nphenomena of human existence and experience are always simul-\ntaneously biological and social\u201d (p. 279). Does it not follow, then,\nthat solutions to reduce \u201cviolence in the streets\u201d are to be sought\nin both the social and biological domains?\nWhere the complexity of human behavior is concerned, Rose\nconsiders the biological domain fundamentally irrelevant, because\nhe does not believe that genetics can usefully explain, for exam-\nple, why some individuals murder while others do not. Although\nthere may not be \u201caggression genes\u201d per se, it is hard to deny that\ngenetic variation contributes to individual differences in tem-\nperament, sensation seeking (Zuckerman 1984) and other per-\nsonality features that predispose some individuals to act violently,\nor to show impaired judgment of what is socially appropriate.\nMoreover, evolutionary psychology has yielded powerful insights\ninto the social stimuli that reliably trigger human violence (e.g.,\nDaly & Wilson 1988). Thus, while culture defines when violence\nis appropriate, it does not follow, as Rose would have it, that either\nthe capacity or the prepotent nature of stimuli for violence are cul-\ntural.\nScience as a mirror of reality. Rose suggests that research in the\nbio-behavioral sciences is at the mercy of political whim and\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n908 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\n\u201cdominant social expectations\u201d rather than being a \u201ctrue reflect-\ning mirror\u201d of nature\u201d (p. 274). This allows him to dismiss as po-\nlitically motivated the research program of the ultra-Darwinists\nand evolutionary psychologists. To be sure, science as a cultural\nactivity is not immune to influence from other cultural domains.\nWould Rose not agree, however, that in order to succeed, science\nmust provide the best possible mirror of reality? Scientific pre-\ndictions about how nature works either come out or they do not.\nWhy not let science do its work where evolutionary psychology\nis concerned? If the ultra-Darwinist approach to humans turns out\nto be a poor mirror of reality, it will have to be abandoned in favor\nof a more productive (predictive) program. The last quarter cen-\ntury of sociobiological research has not given any indication that\nits premises are flawed or its predictive powers diminished.\nRather, the reason for the program\u2019s continued success is its power\nto identify novel research directions and to yield deep insights into\nthe human condition, whereas the traditional consideration of\npurely socio-cultural factors in human behavior has stagnated.\nRather than ignoring \u201cthe historical and anthropological evidence\nof variation in social practices across time and space, and instead\ntreat current Western norms . . . as if they were human universals\u201d\n(p. 198), many evolutionary psychologists\u2019 accounts have fully en-\ncompassed \u201cthe rich diversity of human experience\u201d (e.g., see\nBuss 1994). Rose\u2019s caricatures of the application of reciprocal al-\ntruism and parental investment theory to human behavior fail to\ndo justice to the corpus of genuine insights these theories have\nprovided. Regardless of our opinion of their worth, only data and\nthe continued predictive power of theory, rather than rhetoric or\npolitical motivation, will decide whether sociobiology or evolu-\ntionary psychology survive or fail.\nAutopoiesis and Lifelines: The importance \nof origins\nEvan Thompsona and Francisco J.

Rose\u2019s argument\ncould have been strengthened by taking greater account of the theory of\nautopoiesis in biology and of enactive cognitive science.\nWe agree with all ten major theses of Lifelines (pp. 303\u2013309) and\nwish to congratulate Steven Rose for his useful corrective to the\nexcesses of \u201cultra-Darwinism.\u201d Especially important is his ninth\nthesis \u201cThe past is the key to the present\u201d (p. 309), or, as he states\nit at the beginning of the book: \u201cNothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in the light of history . . . the history of life on Earth . . . the\nhistory of the individual organism . . . the history of our own sub-\nject, biology\u201d (pp. 15\u201316). Unfortunately, in the case of the history\nof biology, Rose neglects to acknowledge the scientific origins of\none of his central concepts, that of autopoiesis, and fails to cite and\ncredit its originators. Furthermore, he could have strengthened\nhis argument had he drawn from subsequent developments in bi-\nology and cognitive science inspired by the autopoietic perspec-\ntive.\nThe idea of autopoiesis \u2013 that living systems produce them-\nselves continuously through their own activity \u2013 forms part of the\nbackbone of Lifelines. This is as it should be, for the idea of au-\ntopoiesis places the organism at the heart of biology. As Rose\nwrites when he first introduces the idea:\nTo put the organism and its lifeline back at the core of biology . . . means\nreplacing the static, reductive, DNA-centred view of living systems . . .\nwith an emphasis on the dynamics of life . . . Instead we must speak of\nthe dialectic . . . through which the living organism constructs itself.\nThe central property of all life is the capacity and necessity to build,\nmaintain and preserve itself, a process known as autopoiesis [Rose\u2019s\nemphasis]. (p. 18)\nWhat he neglects to tell the reader is that the very coinage of\nthe word, its meaning, and the many consequences it entails, did\nnot arise ex nihilo, without a history, to populate the world of ideas\nanonymously (\u201ca process known as\u201d). It has an origin that is clearly\ninscribed in the scientific record of publications: the notion and\nmany of its consequences for biology (see below) were introduced\nby Humberto R. Maturana and Francisco J. Varela, first in 1973\nin a Spanish monograph (Maturana & Varela 1973), which ap-\npeared in English in 1980 (Maturana & Varela 1980), and then in\na paper in English, complete with cellular automata modes, in\n1974 (Varela, Maturana & Uribe 1974). A book treatment con-\ncerning autopoiesis as an exemplar of the autonomy of living sys-\ntems appeared in 1979 (Varela 1979). Why does Rose not cite the\nactual origins of this idea and present its precise formulation, as\nhe does for metabolic complex graphs (p. 164) or autocatlytic sets\n(p. 265)?\nSince 1974 a large body of literature on autopoiesis has been\nproduced in experimental and theoretical biology. Let us mention\njust two examples, both concerned with the origin of life, and\ntherefore of direct relevance to Rose\u2019s discussion of \u201cOrigin\nmyths\u201d (pp. 250\u201371). First, Lynn Margulis has explicitly acknowl-\nedged (with proper citation) the importance of autopoiesis in her\nwork on symbiosis and the origins of sex (Margulis & Sagan 1986),\nand in her popular book with Dorian Sagan What is life? (Mar-\ngulis & Sagan 1995). Second, some of the most interesting exper-\nimental advances in research on the origins of life have been in-\nspired by the theory of autopoiesis. Thus, Bachman et al. (1992)\nconstructed a minimal autopoietic system using autocatalytic self-\nreplicating micelles. The self-replication of these micelles occurs\nas a direct consequence of their autopoiesis or self-production,\nand the latter occurs without DNA and proteins. Thus these\nchemical systems tangibly reinforce Rose\u2019s argument in Chapter\n9 that life probably originated with autopoietic protocells rather\nthan naked molecular replicators. As Bachman et al. observed:\nWithin this framework, there is no mention of DNA or proteins, but the\npresent autopoietic system can be considered as a cell that metabolizes\nlow-molecular-weight components. A true \u2018protocell\u2019 will require DNA,\nRNA and proteins to encode and transfer genetic information; but it\nprovides a useful new perspective to recognize that a primitive mecha-\nnism for self-replication and metabolism can exist without them. (Bach-\nman et al. 1992, p. 59)\nIf the notion of autopoiesis had originally been introduced only\nto address the unitary organization of life at the cellular level, then\nour point about Rose\u2019s failure to acknowledge his predecessors\nwould stop there. As the original publications make clear, how-\never, the main motivation of the theory of autopoiesis was, from\nthe beginning, to provide a new approach to the biology of cogni-\ntion in which the organism and its space-time pathway occupy\ncenter-stage (Maturana & Varela 1980; see also Varela 1996). In-\ndeed, Maturana and Varela (1987) unfold these implications for\nour understanding of evolution and cognition, in terms that Rose\u2019s\nbook closely follows. Other more detailed implications have been\npresented for our understanding of the immune system (Varela &\nCoutinho 1991), evolution (Varela et al. 1991, Ch. 9), biological in-\ndividuality (Varela 1991), and artificial intelligence and artificial\nlife (Thompson 1997; Varela 1997; Varela & Bourgine 1992).\nAn especially important point concerns the consequences of au-\ntopoieis for reinterpreting the operation of the nervous system in\ncognition. The central revision was to discard the idea that the \nnervous system encodes the external environment in an internal\nrepresentation, so as to ensure the optimal adaptation of the or-\nganism. The nervous system was instead seen as a unitary recur-\nsive network, situated within an autonomous (self-governing or\n\u201chomeodynamic\u201d) organism, itself engaged in a constant flow of\naction embedded in its surroundings. Cognition via the nervous\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 909\nsystem is not the \u201cpicking up\u201d of prexisting information \u201cout\nthere,\u201d but rather the bringing forth of meaning in ontogenetic\nand phylogenetic \u201clifelines\u201d \u2013 the laying down of a path in walk-\ning, to use our metaphor (Varela et al. 1991, Ch. 9). One of the\nbest illustrations of this idea, both for its biological and cognitive\nscientific detail, and for its philosophical wealth, comes from com-\nparative color vision and ecological perception: colors do not exist\nout there, waiting to be represented internally; they are brought\nforth in ecologically situated, perceptually guided action (Thomp-\nson 1995; Thompson et al. 1992). In cognitive science, this non-\nadaptationist and non-representationist perspective on life and\ncognition is now known as the enactive approach (Chiel & Beer\n1997; Clark 1997; Varela et al. 1991).\nRose refers to none of this work. Perhaps we should feel pleased\nthat a distinguished biologist weaves as a central part of his argu-\nment ideas that others have toiled to develop: it must mean that\nthese ideas have become part of our shared intellectual heritage,\nfor all to use and enjoy. Nevertheless, citing one\u2019s sources for key\nconcepts and ideas is an essential part of scientific practice. Had\nRose done so, his book would have been more accurate; had he\nmade use of the literature mentioned above, his argument would\nhave been stronger. And we would have been able to give his ar-\nguments the attention they deserve, rather than voice this call for\nfairness.\nHigh purpose, low execution\nNicholas S. Thompson\nDepartments of Ethology and Psychology, Clark University, Worcester, MA\n01610. nthompson@clarku.edu\nAbstract: In reasserting the primacy of the individual in biological analy-\nsis, Rose directs attention away from the crucial insights of the develop-\nmental\/structuralist perspective that he advocates. In presenting his ad-\nvocacy as a diatribe, he brings disrespect down upon that very tradition.\nOn Steven Rose\u2019s own account, his goal in writing Lifelines is to\n\u201coffer a coherent alternative frame work [to contemporary Dar-\nwinism] within which to interpret living processes.\u201d The promise\nof such a framework was enticing because of recent works that\nsuggest that the Darwinian paradigm may be due for at least a\nthorough overhaul. The works I have in mind include Waldrop\u2019s\n(1993) Complexity, Goodwin\u2019s (1994) How the leopard changed\nhis spots, Sapp\u2019s (1994) Evolution by association, Sober and Wil-\nson\u2019s (1998) Unto others, and Depew and Weber\u2019s (1997) Dar-\nwinism evolving. Rose\u2019s Lifelines falls far short of its high purpose\nin both substantive and rhetorical ways.\nSubstance. Metaphors are essential to science, but every sci-\nentific metaphor incurs costs as well as benefits. The costs of us-\ning a metaphor arise from disanalogies between the metaphor and\nits object. These costs are weighed against the power of the\nmetaphor to bring order to what we know and to suggest other dis-\ncoveries we might make. The useful life of a scientific metaphor\nis brought to a close when the discoveries it stimulates reveal too\nmany disanalogies.\nThe metaphor of natural selection is rooted in Darwin\u2019s corre-\nspondence with breeders, who taught him that the composition of\na flock can be changed by selecting desirable individuals for mat-\ning. The metaphor thus focuses attention on the differential re-\nproduction of individuals. But many of the findings described in\nthe works cited above seem to suggest that in focussing on the in-\ndividual, we miss much of what is essential in biology that is going\non at levels of organization above and below the level of the indi-\nvidual.\nThese problems with the metaphor of selection are not going to\nbe solved by frame shifting the metaphor to levels above or below\nthe individual because at whatever level we care to look, objects\nseen as good entities from higher levels of organization appear as\ndiaphanous webs of interaction when examined closely at the next\nlevel down. Thus, my hope for Lifelines was that it would provide\na way of looking at biological organization that would broaden our\nfocus beyond the individual as a privileged level of organization.\nRegrettably, Rose grabs the other end of the stick.\nRhetoric. Not only is Rose\u2019s vision of the future of biology dis-\nappointing, his arguments for that vision often seem incomplete,\nill-founded, and even mean-spirited. Consider, for example, the\npassage that opens the Preface.\nThe rise of the present enthusiasms for biologically determinist ac-\ncounts of the human condition date to the late 1960s. They were not\ninitiated by any specific advance in biological science, or powerful new\ntheory, but harked back instead to an earlier tradition of eugenic think-\ning which . . . had been eclipsed and driven into intellectual and politi-\ncal disrepute in the aftermath of the war against Nazi Germany and its\nracially inspired Holocaust.\nThe passage is a good example of a rhetorical technique known as\nthe Big Lie. Big Lies work for two reasons. First, they are so vague\nand all-encompassing that the evidence necessary to refute them\nis difficult to conceptualize, let alone marshal. Second, they sup-\npress rebuttal by pre-stigmatizing it. Let us examine each of its\ncomponents in detail:\nThe rise of the present enthusiasms for biologically determinist ac-\ncounts of the human condition date to the late 1960s.\nIf what the author is talking about here is what he later identifies\nas \u201cultra-Darwinism,\u201d then that movement dates from the publi-\ncation of Wynne-Edwards (1962) voluminous, Animal dispersion\nin relation to social behavior, which asserts that much social be-\nhavior has been selected at the level of the population. At the core\nof this influential work was a dramatic analogy between animal so-\ncial systems and the conventions that limited fishing fleets in the\nNorth Atlantic. This vivid concretization of the population-\nselection argument, which had been immanent in the literature\nfor many years, prompted immediate individual-level responses\nfrom William Hamilton, George Williams, and Robert Trivers, fol-\nlowed only belatedly by E. O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins. In\nshort, the intellectual developments that Rose ascribes to the late\nsixties actually evolved over a 20-year period from the early sixties\nto the late 70s.\nThey were not initiated by any specific advance in biological science, or\npowerful new theory.\nBy any objective standard the period of which Rose speaks here\nwas a time of breathtaking theoretical development and empirical\nachievement in the study of behavior and evolution. All over the\nU.S.A. and Europe, new graduate programs in behavior and evo-\nlution were started, and the deluge of new information about an-\nimal behavior was overwhelming. Two theoretical innovations that\ndistinguish this period are often confused. The first might be\ncalled \u201cbiological individualism\u201d; the interpretation of animal so-\ncial organizations in terms of the interests of individuals. The sec-\nond might be called \u201cbiological genism\u201d; the interpretation of an-\nimal social organizations in terms of the interests of abstract units\nof inheritance called genes. Although the failure to discriminate\nthese two positions has led to some important confusions (Sober\n& Wilson 1997; Thompson 1998; Thompson & Derr 1995; Wilson\n& Sober 1994), the general paradigm has proven to be extraordi-\nnarily productive, leading literally to thousands of investigations of\nthe details of animal communication, reproduction, and social life.\n. . . but harked back instead to an earlier tradition of eugenic thinking.\nThe words \u201charked back\u201d are the giveaway here. How can one ever\nhope to refute a \u201charking back\u201d? I can only say, speaking as some-\nbody who lived through that time and knew many of the partici-\npants, that I and my colleagues were interested in explanation, not\nin ideology.\n. . . had been eclipsed and driven into intellectual and political disre-\npute in the aftermath of the war against Nazi Germany and its racially\ninspired Holocaust.\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\n910 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nHere, is a reduction, indeed: a generation of field and laboratory\ninvestigations by hundreds of hard-working people reduced to a\npolitical epithet!

Richard Udry\nCarolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,\nChapel Hill, NC 27516-3997. udry@unc.edu\nAbstract: Rose erroneously believes that the sciences of human behavior\nare being swept with a wave of genetic determinism. Actually, sociologists\nand psychologists remain predominantly hostile to any genetic influence\non behavior. They will love Rose. The few behavior geneticists and socio-\nbiologists in these disciplines are marginalized and looking for a little re-\nspect. Rose impugns their motives and ridicules their science.\nRose proclaims that his purpose is to promote \u201ca vision which rec-\nognizes the power and role of genes without subscribing to genetic\ndeterminism\u201d (p. 7). From his reading of Dawkins and the Sun-\nday newspapers, he sees ultra-Darwinism (sociobiology) sweeping\nthe sciences of human behavior. Rose and the \u201cradical science\nmovement\u201d (as he calls it) have been fighting this battle for a long\ntime. He sees it as a continuation of the battle against eugenics.\nImplicit racism, Rose charges, is the fundamental motivation of\nthose who hold for either the evolutionary foundations of human\nnature or for the genetic explanation of individual variance in be-\nhavior (behavior genetics).\nHow big is the sweep of this takeover of the sciences by genetic\ndeterminism? As a biologist looking at the social and behavioral\nsciences, Rose seems to believe genetic determinism has carried\nthe day. I live and work as a sociologist among other social scien-\ntists. From here the view is less clouded by the perceptions of jour-\nnalists about the big science news. In sociology, sociobiologists are\npariahs trying to claw a little toehold in the discipline. In psychol-\nogy, what is now called evolutionary psychology may be big with\nthe newspapers, but in the discipline as a whole it is a speck on the\npublic image.\nSo it is humorous to think that sociology and psychology are be-\ning swept by a wave of genetic determinism. Generally we social\nscientists, like Rose, hold very strong views against it. But this is\nnot because we want to be politically correct. We can\u2019t help our-\nselves. Our shared disciplinary immune systems recognize biolog-\nical explanation of behavior as an infection, and reject it. (This is\na metaphor, not a homology.) Rose would immediately recognize\nthat our arguments against any biological explanation of behavior\nare his against genetic determinism. His arguments even contain\nthe same innocent mistakes as ours do (for example, confusing the\ncauses of secular trends with the causes of variance among indi-\nviduals).\nRose says he wants us all to recognize the power of genes while\nrejecting genetic determinism. Maybe, because he says Lifelines\nis written to be a within-biology argument, his battle is with other\nbiologists (he says it is mainly with those who don\u2019t do biological\nscience, or at least not any more). His argument with the social sci-\nence disciplines today does not need to focus on fighting genetic\ndeterminism so much as to help us accord any power to the genes\nat all when it comes to behavior. The only genetic determinists I\ncan find are the rhetorical bogymen conjured up by Rose. Even\nthe most radical behavior geneticists are theorizing (and finding)\nenvironmental effects on genetic process, and genetic influence\non social processes.\nIn the real world of scholars today, let us concede to Rose (who\nmust know) that there are genetic determinists among biologists.\nPerhaps he will reach them with his message that the organism\nshapes its own development. In the world outside biology there\nare scholars who believe human behavior in part evolved geneti-\ncally (that is, that there is a human nature), and those who do not\n(that is, that there is no human nature). No one believes that hu-\nman behavior is completely controlled by evolution. No one be-\nlieves that variance in (any) human behavior is determined com-\npletely by genetic differences; but many believe that there is no\ngenetic influence. From the social\/behavioral sciences, Lifelines\nwill appeal to those who reject evolutionary and genetic influence.\nHow will this help Rose achieve his goal?\nRose\u2019s homeodynamic perspective is not \nan alternative to neo-Darwinism\nA. J. Wells\nDepartment of Social Psychology, The London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom. a.j.wells@lse.ac.uk\nAbstract: Lifelines discusses two approaches to biology, \u201cultra-Darwinism\u201d\nwhich Rose criticises, and the \u201chomeodynamic perspective,\u201d which he of-\nfers as an alternative. This review suggests that ultra-Darwinism is a cari-\ncature of the theoretical positions Rose wishes to oppose and that the\nhomeodynamic perspective is not an alternative, but is complementary to\nso-called ultra-Darwinism.\nLifelines discusses two approaches to biology. Rose calls one \u201cultra-\nDarwinism,\u201d and the other the \u201chomeodynamic\u201d perspective. \nUltra-Darwinism, says Rose, has, among others, the following flaws:\n1. It is biologically and \u201cneurogenetically\u201d determinist (pp. viii,\nix).\n2. It uses misleading information theoretic metaphors (pp. 121,\n137).\n3. It claims that the individual gene is the \u201cunit of life\u201d (p. 209).\n4. It uses a \u201cbilliard-ball\u201d model of the gene (p. 210).\n5. It claims that every observable aspect of the phenotype of an\norganism is adaptive (pp. 210, 230).\n6. It is preformationist (p. 212).\n7. It entails mind-body dualism (p. 214).\n8. It assumes a direct, unmodifiable link between gene and\nadult phenotype (pp. 215, 221).\n9. It excludes processes of development and \u201cthe internal phys-\niological processes which constitute the organism\u201d (p. 215).\n10. It claims that organisms are inherently passive (p. 244).\nThe homeodynamic perspective, by contrast, is said to be free of\nthese major flaws and is offered as \u201ca coherent alternative frame-\nwork\u201d (p. ix) which transcends genetic reductionism and places\nthe organism at the centre of life.\nLooking at the list of shortcomings above, one might be for-\ngiven for thinking that ultra-Darwinism, as Rose presents it, is in-\ntended to portray an extreme view that no one actually holds. Thus\nits purpose would be essentially heuristic. But although in places\nRose writes as though this were so (e.g., pp. x 209), he also assures\nthe reader that there are many real ultra-Darwinists. In the \nlast decade, he claims, \u201cthe stream of ultra-Darwinist and biolog-\nically determinist claims has become a torrent\u201d (p. viii). Richard\nDawkins and Dan Dennett are singled out early on as arch \nultra-Darwinists, and E. O. Wilson merits a number of specific\nmentions. Moreover, there is a suggestion (p. 176) that ultra-\nDarwinism is just another name for neo-Darwinism, in which case\none ought, presumably, to count among the ultra-Darwinists peo-\nCommentary\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 911\nple like George Williams, Bob Trivers, Bill Hamilton, and John\nMaynard-Smith.\nIt is manifestly incorrect to attribute to neo-Darwinian theorists\nthe catalogue of errors of which Rose wishes to convict them. His\ncase does not stand up even to a cursory reading of the works of\nthose he criticises. Nor are his arguments compelling. (See, for ex-\nample, the clumsy attempt to justify the charge that Dawkins im-\nports dualism into his explanatory framework, pp. 213\u201314.) One\npossible explanation for his claims is that Rose has simply failed to\nmake a key distinction between the capacity to change behaviour\nand the capacity to change genetic structure.\nIt is a central tenet of neo-Darwinism that acquired character-\nistics are not passed on from one generation to the next by the bi-\nological process of reproduction. This understanding is encapsu-\nlated in the so-called \u201ccentral dogma,\u201d originally expounded by\nAugust Weismann, who argued that information flow goes one\nway only from germ plasm to soma, or, in molecular terminology,\nfrom DNA to protein. Bodies cannot modify their genomes by\npractice or effort. The blacksmith cannot bequeath to his offspring\nthe effects of his craft on his biceps. There are exceptions to the\ncentral dogma, but they are few in number and their significance\nis hard to assess. Exceptions are rare because most phenotypic\nchanges are not adaptive. A hereditary mechanism that allowed\nthe transmission of such changes would not be favoured by nat-\nural selection. Thus, in general, we do not have the capacity to\nchange our genetic structure.\nIt does not follow from this that neo-Darwinists believe behav-\niour to be unmodifiable or that they think developmental pro-\ncesses are unimportant and can be ignored. If genes were only\nable to build reflex mechanisms then the human behavioural\nrepertoire would indeed consist of nothing more than a set of fixed\naction patterns. But there is no reason at all to suppose that genes\nare limited in this way and every reason to suppose that they struc-\nture decision making mechanisms which are highly sensitive to en-\nvironmental contingencies of many kinds. As Rose rightly says, an\nindividual lifetime involves complex interactions between genes\nand environments. Neo-Darwinists are in full agreement with this\nproposition.\nRose\u2019s apparent inability to understand that \u201cgenes for\u201d psy-\nchological mechanisms do not preclude behavioural flexibility\nmay be related to his evident distaste for computational thinking.\nThe significant point about computational thinking is that it has\nbanished the last vestiges of dualism from contemporary psychol-\nogy and shows precisely how to avoid the infinite regress of rep-\nresentational systems that plagued early attempts to achieve a sat-\nisfactory materialist basis for mental processing. It is just because\ninformation can be encoded in physically realisable structures that\nbehavioural flexibility is possible and explicable in a non-circular\nway.\nIt is regrettable that Rose chose to present the homeodynamic\nperspective as an alternative to the neo-Darwinian perspective\nwhen in fact they are complementary. There are, for example,\nmany evolutionary psychologists and behavioural ecologists who\ncount themselves as neo-Darwinists, whose interests emphasise\ndevelopment and other ontogenetic issues which Rose claims are\nprecluded by neo-Darwinism. Rose\u2019s treatment of sexual selection\nand kin selection theory (pp. 197\u2013203) is an instance of this false\nopposition. He claims without argument that sexual selection the-\nory \u201csimply cannot encompass the rich diversity of human experi-\nence\u201d (p. 198) and that kin selection theory suffers from a \u201crela-\ntive lack of experimental support\u201d (p. 202). To argue thus is to\nignore a large and growing body of empirical evidence that illus-\ntrates the fruitfulness of both of these theories for the framing of\ntestable hypotheses in psychology and behavioural ecology. Par-\nent\u2013offspring conflict, familial violence, and the nature of mate\nchoice are all aspects of individual lifelines which are being illu-\nminated by neo-Darwinist thinking.\nRose suggests (p. viii) that the views of those he criticises are\nbased on shaky empirical evidence and unexamined ideological\npresuppositions. There is a certain irony in this claim because it is\nhard to avoid the conclusion that the ultra-Darwinism which Rose\nexcoriates throughout Lifelines is essentially a product of his own\ntheoretical proclivities and ideological assumptions. As a result,\nLifelines fails as a critique of contemporary neo-Darwinian think-\ning in biology and also in psychology because there is no one out\nthere who thinks as he claims they do.\nAuthor\u2019s Response\nBiological determinism lives and needs\nrefutation  despite denials\nSteven Rose\nBiology Department, Brain and Behaviour Research Group, Open University,\nMilton Keynes MK7 6AA, United Kingdom. s.p.r.rose@open.ac.uk\nAbstract: Commentators are divided between those who wel-\ncome and creatively extend the agenda of Lifelines and those who\ndefend what it criticises. My response covers style; history, poli-\ntics, and ethics; concepts of freedom, active organisms, and de-\nterminism; the uses of metaphor; reductionism and levels of analy-\nsis; Darwin and Darwinists; heritability and intelligence; human\nuniversals and biological determinism.\nReading reviews of one\u2019s book is always an interesting ex-\nperience, and where the reviews are multiple as in the BBS\nformat it can be particularly challenging. This mixed set of\nreactions has been instructive, and I have been forcefully\nreminded that the attempt to communicate by writing, a\nsort of contract between author and reader, requires mu-\ntual effort. The book a reader reads may very well not be\nthat the author believes he has written. Indeed, in the case\nof some of the reviews of Lifelines, I have had a strong sense\nof dej\u00e0 vu that the reviewers really felt they were reviewing\nthe book I co-authored some 15 years ago with Richard\nLewontin and Leo Kamin, Not in our genes (Rose, Lewon-\ntin & Kamin 1984). This is notably the case with Alcock,\nwho even bolsters his rather adjective-laden argument by\nquoting, substantially out of context, a review of that book\nwritten by my colleague Pat Bateson. So I make no apology\nfor restating here what Lifelines was intended, from this\nwriter\u2019s perspective, to be about, and then replying in more\ndetail to the specific points raised. In doing so I will also \nrefer to two books which had not appeared when Lifelines\nwas written but which illustrate some of its points rather\nclearly: Steven Pinker\u2019s How the mind works (1997) and \nE. O. Wilson\u2019s Consilience (1998) (see also the comments\nby Hirsch \u2013 whose defence of Loeb, by contrast, encour-\nages me to re-evaluate that early mechanist).\nBefore even doing that, however, I owe one unreserved\napology. Thompson & Varela, whilst generously com-\nmending the theses of the book concerning autopoiesis,\nrightly charge me with failing to credit the term to its orig-\ninators, Maturana and Varela (1980). I was shocked to \ndiscover on rereading my own text that I had omitted this\nelementary scholarly responsibility, especially as I have al-\nways been conscious of the intellectual debt I owe to their\nwork, and agree with them entirely that an appreciation of\nthe origins of a concept is essential for a full grasp of its \nsignificance. I\u2019ll come back to the defence of autopoiesis\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\n912 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nagainst some of its other critics among the reviews later, but\nwant to make it clear up front that the omission of credit, in\nevery sense of the term, has now been fully rectified in any\nmore recent edition of the book.\nR1. What Lifelines is about\nContrary to the impression that one might get from read-\ning some of the reviews of the book, Lifelines is not a polit-\nical tract, nor a detailed discussion of the social origins or\nimplications of biological determinism, least of all an affir-\nmation of \u201cMarxist philosophy,\u201d if indeed that protean epi-\nthet has any single meaning. The ideological and sociopo-\nlitical framework of the debate occupies only the preface\nand Chapter 10. Nor is it primarily a critique of sociobiol-\nogy, although many of the presuppositions of sociobiology\n(these days rebranded as evolutionary psychology) are in-\ndeed discussed. The book is addressed to that mythical lay\naudience for which those of us concerned with the public\nunderstanding of science see ourselves as writing. It follows\nmy previous book The making of memory, (1992) in at-\ntempting to lay out how my sort of biologist tries to extract\nscientific meaning from the world, the problems of objec-\ntivity in science, and of designing experiments. Some re-\nviewers dismiss the need to do this on the grounds that\neveryone knows about such issues already. I wish that were\ntrue, but in my experience it just isn\u2019t, and even where it is,\nit is considered slightly indecent to mention it outside the\ncharmed circle of active researchers. To appreciate the\nproblem, one need only read books by distinguished biolo-\ngists explaining their subjects with sublime indifference to\nsuch questions.\nHaving set out these themes, I turn my attention to the\nnature of explanation in biology, and confront the question\nof why many (including reviewers I will respond to more\nspecifically below) seem to regard reductionist explanations\nas the only ultimately legitimate ones. At the core of the\nbook are five chapters discussing genetics, development,\nevolutionary mechanisms, and life\u2019s origins and developing\nthe framework within which I believe these need to be con-\nceptualised: homeodynamics, autopoiesis, and complexity.\nThese chapters argue for placing cells and organisms rather\nthan nucleic acids at the centre of living processes. There is\nlittle enough about ecology and population dynamics in the\nbook, which is to be regretted, as some reviewers point out,\nbut this reflects my own perspective and limitations as a\nbiochemist turned neuroscientist (pace Cornish-Bowden\nI don\u2019t just \u201cclaim\u201d to be a biochemist). I confess to some\nsurprise to discover that these core themes occupied so few\nof the reviewers, who preferred to respond to the periph-\nery rather than the centre. Indeed almost the only person\nwho did address them was indeed Cornish-Bowden, who\nsadly totally misunderstands the argument. He claims that\nI first provide a simplistic account of rate-limiting reactions\nin biochemistry, then correct that account, and finally argue\nthat this means that genes are irrelevant to behaviour. In\nfact I do nothing of the sort; the discussion of rate-limiting\nreactions is, as my text makes very clear, a self-critical com-\nment on early editions of a teaching text of mine, The chem-\nistry of life (1991). The second is a description of the\nKacser-Kauffman approach to metabolic complexity, which\nforms part of the explanation of why gene function and ac-\ntion can only be understood in the context of the metabolic\nweb within which they are enmeshed; it is only remotely\nconnected with the discussion of genes and behaviour, and\nnowhere in Lifelines or anywhere else have I ever made the\nabsurd statement that genes have nothing to do with be-\nhaviour. Cornish-Bowden must read more carefully. But so\nbe it: let me turn to the themes that did concern most of\nthose who responded.\nR2. On style\nSome reviewers (Economos, Charlton, and Crusio\namongst them) take exception to a certain robust style of\nwriting, and my specific choice of Dawkins and Dennett as\nfoils for some of my arguments. This is perhaps an excuse\nfor the ad hominem approach of some of the reviews, but I\nmake no apologies. The reasons for my choice are that these\nare amongst the most clear-cut defenders of the positions I\ncriticise (Pinker [1997] and Wilson [1998] would also have\nserved in this regard) and my use of them could almost be\ntaken as a compliment. However, I have a strong feeling of\ndouble standards being applied. All four authors have been\nresponsible for some pretty cheap shots aimed at, for in-\nstance Gould and Lewontin (and me) personally, and as-\nsorted but unspecified \u201cleftists and feminists\u201d in general,\nand I cannot recall their ever being rebuked \u2013 indeed,\nrather the reverse \u2013 for this.\nR3. On history, politics, and ethics\nSeveral reviewers assume that my criticism of biological de-\nterminism and excessively reductive, gene centred thinking\nis based on either political or ethical principles, rather than\nbeing grounded in a within-biology critique, and they take\nme to task accordingly. Thus Charlton states, without evi-\ndence, that I conflate ethical with pragmatic thinking, and\nthat I regard oversimplification as a sin. Au contraire, I re-\ngard it as poor science, though I recognise that simplifica-\ntion is often a useful heuristic device, whether, to use his\nterm, it is \u201caccidental\u201d or not. For instance, both Mendel\u2019s\nlaws and the Central Dogma are, as we now know, simpli-\nfications, but they were both enormously potent and useful\nin their time. Both, however, have long outlived their use-\nfulness, and to continue to claim them as \u201ctruth\u201d is a sort of\nwickedness \u2013 though only to science and the scientific\nethic, not to morality in general. I can\u2019t think for one mo-\nment why Charlton goes on to suggest that Lifelines at-\ntempts to provide a way of determining in advance whether\na biological theory is oversimplified and therefore produces\na general purpose short cut; I can\u2019t recall ever thinking such\na thing, let alone writing it.\nN. S. Thompson disputes the brief history of the rise of\nbiological determinist thought that forms the Preface. I\ntrace the recent history through the late 1960s to a eugenic\npast which I am sure all the reviewers regard as being as\nshameful as do I. My reference to the late 1960s relates\nspecifically to the publication by Jensen (1969) on race and\nIQ and its aftermath. As this history has often been re-\ncounted (e.g., Rose et al. 1984), I didn\u2019t feel it was neces-\nsary to spell it out in detail. I certainly was not referring to\nWynne-Edwards, group selection, and the debates within\nevolutionary theory which were going on, as Thompson\nnotes, both before and after 1969. I am quite astonished\nthat anyone could misread me as doing so, especially as later\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 913\nin the book and in a historically internalist contest I refer\nspecifically and in detail to the history of the group selec-\ntionist\/kin selectionist debate! If there is a Big Lie here it is\ncertainly not mine. And it is absurd to suggest that I \u2013 or in-\ndeed any practicing biologist \u2013 could regard evolutionary\nbiology as in some sense evil. If Lifelines says nothing else,\nit over and over again quotes Dobzhansky (1973) on the\ncentrality of evolutionary thinking to understanding the liv-\ning present. However, anyone amongst the commentators\nwho doubts that these internal debates have political reso-\nnance need only refer to, amongst other things, the use \nof sociobiological claims by conservative writers (Ridley\n1997), racist groups (Brunn 1978; Verrall 1980), anti-\nfeminists (Goldberg 1975; Wright 1994) and many other \nexamples too tedious to list. This doesn\u2019t mean, pace\nSchooler and Economos, that I see a simple link between\nracism, genetics, and psychometry \u2013 although too often in\nthe quite recent history of these sciences such links have in-\ndeed been present and painfully documented (e.g., Gould\n1997). To claim that these issues are above \u201cmere human\npolitics\u201d as Dawkins (1981) once did in an exchange with\nme in Nature is to bury one\u2019s head in the sand.\nR4. On freedom, active organisms,\nand determinism\nLifelines uses the concepts of freedom and of determinism\nin a number of ways, and my failure to spell them out and\ndistinguish between them more clearly is one of the weak\npoints in my account; I have learned from all the reviewers\nwho focus on this theme. The commentary by Freeman\n(see also Freeman 1999) is particularly helpful in empha-\nsising intentionality and agency. It is the active part played\nby all organisms in shaping their own futures which I un-\nderstand by the wonderful term autopoiesis. E. Thompson\n& Varela explicate (and cite) this term more adequately\nthan I did in the book, and also point out that its utility ex-\ntends to the cognitive sphere as well, and I am grateful to\nthem. Alcock\u2019s suggestion that I \u2013 or Varela and his col-\nleagues \u2013 avoid a \u201cdetailed test\u201d of autopoiesis merely con-\nfounds an empirical method with a theoretical framework.\nBoth Fuller and Midgley usefully clarify some of these\nissues, though from rather different perspectives. Fuller\nemphasises the distinction between subjective and objec-\ntive senses of the term freedom \u2013 I may act in a way that\n\u201cfeels\u201d free, for instance to buy this or that product, or to\nhave or not have sex, but \u201cobjectively\u201d I am serving the\nneeds of capitalism or striving to propagate my selfish\ngenes. This use of \u201cobjectively\u201d parrots (I suspect Fuller\u2019s\nusage is deliberate, as he is no innocent in such matters) the\nways that both vulgar Marxists and evolutionary psycholo-\ngists talk. My point is much closer to Midgley\u2019s that the ex-\nistence of explanations and actions at multiple levels means\nthat there are many different forms of such \u201cobjectivity,\u201d\nand that freedom in part depends on the existence of this\nmultiplicity. Fuller explicates the concept of \u201cthe freedom\nof necessity,\u201d commonly if crudely exemplified by the ob-\nservation that we are all free to dine at the Ritz \u2013 provided\nwe have the money to do so. Yet I mean more than just this.\nOf course we are all, as Economos points out, subject to\nthe laws of gravity and chemistry (I won\u2019t dispute here the\nuse of the concept of law) \u2013 an aspect of the argument about\nhuman \u201cuniversals\u201d to which I will return below. But I wish\nto argue that the processes of development and of evolu-\ntionary change are radically underdetermined in quite a dif-\nferent way (as I believe Steklis appreciates in his review).\nThis isn\u2019t, let me assure Leslie, in his disappointment at the\ncoda to the book, because I wish to sneak in vitalism or\nmentalism. It is rather because historical change comes at\nthe meeting point of many \u201cdeterminisms,\u201d physical, bio-\nlogical, social, and technological. Evolutionary mechanisms\n\u2013 natural selection amongst them \u2013 can only respond to the\nhere and now; they cannot predict the future, and hence are\nconstantly tracking moving targets \u2013 targets that move pre-\ncisely because all living forms are constantly modifying\nthem as well as themselves. This is the radical indetermi-\nnacy of evolution.\nR5. On metaphors\nHull, Bradie, and N. S. Thompson comment on my con-\ncern over the power of metaphors in biology. They (and in-\ndeed others who had reviewed the first edition of the book)\npoint out that metaphors are an essential scientific tool; we\nall do try to explain otherwise un-understandable phenom-\nena by analogising them to things or processes we do un-\nderstand \u2013 or at least that we believe we understand. I ac-\ncept this \u2013 and indeed have tried to clarify my views in the\npreface to the paperback edition of the book. But I continue\nto maintain that metaphors are dangerous devices which\nmust be handled with care and responsibility, because they\nseduce one into thinking that the phenomenon one is\nmetaphorising is indeed in some way the same as that to\nwhich it has been likened. Dawkins in particular has a gift\nfor metaphor which contributes to the brilliance of his writ-\ning but is often totally misleading, as in examples I quote in\nLifelines. Furthermore, we seem to draw our metaphors \nin biology either from the behaviour of humans (\u201crape\u201d in\nmallard ducks or \u201charems\u201d amongst baboons, for instance)\nor from human technologies (e.g., brain memory as the\nsame as computer memory). Similarly, the Darwinian\nmetaphor has spread into realms in which it has no busi-\nness, in my view \u2013 for instance, Hull\u2019s use of it to discuss the\nways in which theories in science \u201ccompete\u201d or Dennett\u2019s\nview of natural selection as a \u201cuniversal acid.\u201d This is haz-\nardous, not only because of the ideological and conceptual\nbaggage that such transfers from one domain to another in-\nevitably carry with them.\nOf course Steklis is right that we do as scientists try to\nhold a mirror to reality, but it can never be a plane mirror;\nit is always shaped by \u2013 distorted by \u2013 our framing as-\nsumptions, metaphors, expectations. If the last three\ndecades of debate amongst sociologists and philosophers of\nknowledge has taught us nothing else, it has certainly made\nclear that this is the best we can hope for \u2013 and there are\nmany who would not even allow us that. I agree entirely\ntherefore with Bradie\u2019s points that science can never be\nfree of ideology \u2013 noting that neither he nor I have paused\nto unpack the multiple meanings that that word itself has \u2013\nand that metaphors serve useful heuristic and epistemic\npurposes along with their rhetorical function. Miller wor-\nries that, by pointing out that metaphors drawn from physics\nand technology may do disservice to biology, I appear to re-\nduce Galileo\u2019s achievements to mere historico-social prod-\nucts. Nothing could be further from my intentions. They\nare indeed historico-social products, but not merely this;\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\n914 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nthey also told us something important and at least partially\ntranscendent about the way nature is. I\u2019m not with the so-\ncial constructionists in this debate.\nHull goes on to distinguish between homologies and ho-\nmoplasies \u2013 a term I am not familiar with, but in his exam-\nple of torpedo shapes for efficient swimming it sounds like\na description which might relate either to my reference to\nconstraints of structure and\/or to convergent evolution. In\nany event I am happy with it. I am less happy with his as-\nsertion that no one still takes seriously the conflict between\novists and spermists originally discussed in Needham\u2019s clas-\nsical history of embryology (for an up-to-date history of this\nepisode, see Pinto-Correia 1997). Incidentally. Hull also\ncalls attention usefully to the doubts over the \u201cclassic\u201d nat-\nural selection story of industrial melanism and its reversal\nin peppered moths \u2013 doubts which strengthen rather than\nweaken my arguments. A further important point he raises\nconcerns my critique of the concept of \u201cnatural kind\u201d in bi-\nology (one of several in which I part company from, for in-\nstance, Webster & Goodwin [1997]). Agreeing with my\ndoubts over whether species, organisms, or macromole-\ncules can be regarded as natural kinds, he nonetheless\nclaims that carnivores or founder populations can be so re-\ngarded. I disagree, though I don\u2019t feel strongly on the point;\nthe functional definition is, it seems to me, even more in the\neye of the researcher than the structural one. What is the\nlogic of grouping together dogs and wasps on the grounds\nthat they both feed on flesh? But whether after so much\nagreement Hull\u2019s final sentence follows, others must judge.\nR6. On reductionism and levels of analysis\nIn Lifelines I distinguished between several meanings of\nthe term reductionism, including theory reductionism\n(which did not concern me), methodological reductionism\n(which I regard as an essential aspect of science as it has de-\nveloped historically in the West), philosophical, and ideo-\nlogical reductionism. These distinctions have not always\nbeen recognised by the reviewers. I ask why reductionism\nshould be regarded as the explanatory goal. Michel re-\nsponds by emphasising, rightly I think, that research prag-\nmatics supports reductionism because it is easy, whereas\nwhat he calls \u201cdevelopmental research\u201d is difficult to do\nand, because its results are often not simple, harder to get\nsupported and published.\nHowever, as in my fable of the frog, I insist that in biol-\nogy there are multiple legitimate ways to describe phe-\nnomena, of which the reductionist way is but one, and any\nof these may be appropriate, depending on the purposes for\nwhich it is intended. Miller, whilst sharing my concern,\nsuggests that reductionism is merely a \u201ctemporary aberra-\ntion\u201d which will in due course be transcended. I would like\nto think he is right, but I respond in the shadow of Wilson\u2019s\nConsilience (1998), which is an unblinking claim not merely\nfor the necessity but also for the ultimate triumph of phys-\nical reductionism in eventually bringing even art and ethics\ninto line (see my review, Rose 1999 and Hirsch). The doyen\nof philosophy of science, Thomas Nagel, insists that\nwhereas a non-reductive account \u2013 for instance of the phys-\niology of nerve transmission \u2013 merely \u201cdescribes\u201d the phe-\nnomenon, a reductive one \u2013 presumably in this case in\nterms of ions and membrane properties \u2013 \u201creally explains\u201d\nit (Nagel 1998, pp. 3\u201314). In my view, the reverse is often\nthe case. I suspect that Palm, with his courteously ex-\npressed search for simplicity in scientific explanation,\nwould share Nagel\u2019s view, which is the bedrock to the work\nof many distinguished mathematical modellers and indeed\nmirrors the criticism that nineteenth century physicists laid\nat Darwin\u2019s door when they called his proposed evolution-\nary mechanism \u201cthe law of higgledy-piggledy.\u201d If I dissent\nfrom it, it is because to an experimental biologist \u2013 as Palm\nhimself reflects \u2013 the world is indeed inherently messy and\ncontingent. Miller suggests that neurodynamics may be a\nmore dangerous form of reductionism in what he sees as an\nassault on the concept of the person, because, presumably,\nit may \u201cexplain away\u201d intentionality. I\u2019m not sure I agree\nwith him here. Freeman (1999) has made a substantial con-\ntribution to our understanding of the way that \u201cmeanings\u201d\nand \u201cintentions\u201d may be translated into neurodynamic\nterms, but I don\u2019t think he would see this type of language\nas \u201cexplaining\u201d rather than \u201cdescribing,\u201d to use Nagel\u2019s\nterms. Think of the phrase \u201cI am in love\u201d and then consider\nreducing it to statements about neurodynamics, nerve im-\npulses, hormonal pulses, and so on. Most of us, I suggest,\nwould find the former a satisfying explanation of my be-\nhaviour (despite the disparagement of \u201cfolk psychology\u201d by\nsome computational neurophilosophers), the latter merely\na description.\nEconomos argues the that denying reductionism means\nbelieving in the supernatural or denying any laws or adding\n\u201cnew primitive terms\u201d to \u201cquarks.\u201d I am, she says, an emer-\ngentist (though apparently not \u201ca scholar and a gentleman\u201d\n\u2013 but then I\u2019ve never laid claim to the second of these\nterms). What I do argue is that terms and concepts relevant\nto one level of organisation of the world are often not mean-\ningfully translatable into others. To take some examples\nfrom Midgley (1998), how would Economos translate\n\u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cjustice\u201d into chemical or even biological\nterms? It is in this context that I understand Rowell\u2019s un-\npicking of the complexities of mate selection and her refer-\nence to cooperative phenomena in troops of social animals.\nI appreciate the reference to the need to consider hierar-\nchies in space and time; this is surely right and not at all fully\ndealt with in Lifelines.\nMy discussion of reductionism also raises issues about\nlevels of description and introduces the term translation\nrather than causality to describe their relationships. Sharov\nagrees, but then goes on to claim that I am mistaken to ar-\ngue that \u201cselection at the level of genes [presumably he\nmeans genomic not individual genes] as something onto-\nlogically different from selection at the level of organisms\u201d\n\u2013 these, he says, using my own metaphor, are different lan-\nguages for describing the same thing. I don\u2019t think he is\nright; we are dealing here with a nested hierarchy of selec-\ntion processes, not a mere translation.\nSeveral commentators point to the dangers of replacing\ngenic or physical reductionism with sociological reduction-\nism, and I entirely agree. Stein is an example, and although\nhe expresses important worries about the dominance of\nneuroscientific explanations in psychology and psychiatry,\nhe goes on to argue that there are nonetheless important \ninsights to be gained from such an approach. He cites\nAlzheimer\u2019s as an example, and I am especially pleased to\nconcur, as our own lab is heavily involved in such research\nat present (Lancashire et al. 1999; Mileusnic et al. 1999).\nHe points out too that Brunner (1996) has dissociated him-\nself from some of the uses made of his study of a Dutch\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 915\npedigree with an apparent linkage between MAOA and \u201cvi-\nolence.\u201d Indeed he has, and very helpfully too, though as I\npoint out below, this hasn\u2019t prevented others from inter-\npreting it very crudely indeed.\nI must emphasise again, as I do repeatedly in the book,\nthat the point is not to deny that there are likely to be par-\nticular features of the brain of a person who repeatedly kills\nor is violent to others in a civilian rather than a military con-\ntext, and indeed that there may be specific genes associated\nwith the development of such features, but that this reduc-\ntionist description may not help us in trying to understand\nor limit the level of violence in society. The task of good \nscience and of effective social policy is to try to identify de-\ntermining levels of causation and potential sites of inter-\nvention. In this context, Fuller argues for the need to dis-\ntinguish \u201cgenuinely efficacious\u201d interventions from merely\n\u201cconvenient\u201d ones. I couldn\u2019t agree more, but would point\nout that these very terms are not neutral. Efficacious for\nwhom? Convenient to whom? What might be socially both\nconvenient and efficacious, for instance, transportation for\nsheep stealing to British landowners in the eighteenth cen-\ntury, might not be either for the transportees.\nIt is precisely here that I argue, contra Schooler, that the\nuse of ritalin to treat children given an ADHD diagnosis is\n\u2013 to put it no more strongly \u2013 frequently misguided: effi-\ncacious and convenient perhaps for schools authorities, but\ndistinctly less so for the child given the drug, granted its\nmany less than desirable pharmacological effects (Breggin\n1999). In this context I am quite puzzled by Schooler\u2019s claim\nthat I am disrespectful of sociology and want to colonise it\nfor biology. Anderson makes a similar claim: that I want bi-\nology to have a veto over psychology. Some mistake here\nsurely. Wilson (1998) explicitly and Pinker (1997) certainly\nimplicitly make such claims, but nothing could be further\nfrom my intentions or my arguments; one of the points of\nLifelines is to argue (contra Wilson, Pinker, and evolution-\nary psychologists in general) for the relative autonomy of\nboth psychological and sociological levels of description.\nAnderson goes on to claim an even more damaging veto, in\nasserting that behaviour genetics can determine the general\nphenomena that a psychological theory must accommo-\ndate. Indeed, other reviewers, such as Economos, criticise\nme for apparently going too far in this direction. My at-\ntempt to resist such biological colonisation could scarcely\nbe otherwise, as I have lived and co-written with a sociolo-\ngist for the best part of forty years! Perhaps Anderson and\nSchooler misinterpret me because I am as unhappy about\nthe psychometrising of sociology as I am about psychome-\ntry\u2019s reductive approach to psychology, and because I have\nan (outsider\u2019s) preference for these disciplines\u2019 more \ndynamic and qualitative rather than quantitative and func-\ntionalist traditions. Despite Schooler, the antithesis of \u201crig-\norous psychometric measures of such psychological char-\nacteristics as job satisfaction\u201d is not necessarily \u201carmchair\nspeculation,\u201d as a multitude of sociologists and psycholo-\ngists of less reductive schools would speedily attest.\nR7. On Darwin and Darwinists\nIn their anxiety to stamp out what they see as heresy, a num-\nber of reviewers imply that my critique of ultra- or funda-\nmentalist Darwinism is equally a critique of the neo-\nDarwinian synthesis of the 1930s, or of Darwin himself.\nThus Wells claims that Darwin\u2019s central tenet is Weiss-\nmanism. Is it? Darwin himself knew better, as later editions\nof The origin attest, and Weissmanian dogma is itself, and\nalways has been, under challenge from a number of\nsources, especially biochemical, developmental and micro-\nbiological, several of which are cited in Lifelines, notably\nBonner (see also Dover 1992; 2000). And consider the re-\ncent flurry of interest in prions, or in protein splicing (e.g.,\nCooper & Stevens 1995). I\u2019m afraid Wells\u2019s review illus-\ntrates the mess that nonbiologists often get into in their en-\nthusiasm for over-simple philosophically rather than data-\ndriven inputs into this debate. Charlton claims that I\nignore good work done by evolutionary biologists and cites\nin particular Szathmary and Maynard Smith\u2019s (Maynard\nSmith & Szathmary 1995) work on major transitions in evo-\nlution to defend Maynard Smith from a charge I never make:\nthat he is himself an ultra-Darwinist in the Dawkins\/Pinker\nsense. There are many interesting themes in that book, es-\npecially in its early chapters, and Maynard Smith is far too\nsubtle a thinker ever to be so branded, despite his associa-\ntion with the \u201cfundis.\u201d As I point out in Lifelines, his mod-\nels of evolutionary stable strategies are quite consonant\nwith population level selection.\nR8. On heritability and intelligence\nCrusio asks what grounds I have for believing that intelli-\ngence is a more complex phenotype than milk yield, where\nI agree that heritability measures may be of relevance. I dis-\npute two points. The first is that \u201cintelligence\u201d is definable\nin a way that makes it a phenotype at all, unless it is reduced\nto a fixed lump in the head called IQ. For a review of why\nintelligence is not reducible to IQ, see Richardson (1998;\n1999). Here I agree with Anderson, who states that\nwhether intelligence is quantifiable or not depends on\nwhether we have a theory that allows for the quantification\nof its constructs. I deny that such a theory could be valid,\nbut claim that intelligent behaviour, thought, and action are\nemergent interactions, socially defined for the most part,\nbetween individuals and their social and physical environ-\nment. They are only partially \u201cembedded\u201d within the brain\nand body of the person concerned. Of course there are\nbrain processes, of many sorts, involved in this interaction,\nas Martindale points out; it would be highly surprising to\nany neuroscientist if there were not. \u201cSpeed of processing\u201d\nor some EEG parameters may be among them. But before\nwe get too carried away with such relatively crude correla-\ntions, let me point to the difficulties that 40 years of good\nneuroscientific work have encountered in attempting to de-\nfine the molecular, cellular, and physiological correlates of\neven such a seemingly tractable problem as simple associa-\ntion learning in animal models (see, e.g., Rose 1993, for a\nreview).\nI appreciate the richer discussion of these issues by\nDepue and the attempt to ground such measures as extra-\nversion in neurobiological parameters. His discussion of the\ncapacity \u2013 surely a relevant biological process \u2013 by which\nstability may be generated through plasticity is important,\nthough I feel as queasy about these psychometric con-\nstructs as I do about IQ. More fundamentally, for all the\nreasons specified in Lifelines, I challenge the obsession that\npsychometricians and behaviour geneticists have with the\nfundamentally meaningless statistic called heritability. I\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\n916 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5\nthank Hirsch for his further development of this point (and\nfor pointing to several minor errors in the text of the hard-\nback, most of which have been caught and corrected in the\npaperback). But even if one grants behaviour geneticists\ntheir use of the term, its application in twin and related\nstudies is highly problematic, as Segalowitz, following in a\nlong tradition, points out. For Anderson to suggest that\n\u201cmeasuring two identical twins [reared apart] is just about\nindistinguishable from measuring the same twin twice\u201d sug-\ngests to me that he has never spoken to twins, even those\nreared together. Martindale also refers to my regret that\nBouchard was unwilling to provide access to his primary\ndata \u2013 an unwillingness that he has also shown to date in \nresponse to requests from researchers undertaking meta-\nanalyses of published twin studies \u2013 on the grounds of con-\nfidentiality. There are, of course, easy ways to protect such\nconfidentiality via coding, and I remain unconvinced.\nR9. On human universals \nand biological determinism\nUnsurprisingly, granted the readership of BBS, these are\nthe themes which have attracted mostly hostile responses.\nBroude sets the issue up by providing an entire paragraph\nof apparent human universals, derived from a bizarre list \nattributed to the ancestral positivist anthropologist G. P.\nMurdock (1945), long abandoned in the anthropological\ncommunity, though clearly still an influence amongst some\npsychologists. Of course there are such universals; the soci-\neties we create are profoundly shaped by the length of the\nhuman lifespan and the neoteny of our offspring, to say\nnothing of our size (as Haldane [1985] pointed out many\nyears ago in the marvellous sentence which forms the epi-\ngram to one of my chapters [Ch. 8], or the fact that we\nbreathe air not water, and are omnivorous. As Ahouse (per-\nsonal communication) points out in a comment on Wilson\u2019s\nview about human art, expressed in Consilience, no one\nwould expect dogs to paint in colour, or I would add, hu-\nmans in infra-red or ultra-violet \u2013 until the arrival of tech-\nnologies that made these wavelengths \u201cvisible\u201d to us. But to\nsay that gestures, cooking, tool-making, trade, or ethics are\nhuman universals is to say absolutely nothing other than\nthat humans are social animals who have developed tech-\nnologies for living, and it entirely ignores the diversity of\nforms that these assumed Platonic natural kinds may take.\nTo add kin groups to these might imply that the social def-\ninition of kin is coterminous with the biological one used in\ndefinitions of inclusive fitness, yet of course it is nothing of\nthe sort; social definitions of kin are remarkably complex\nand varied (the reductio ad absurdum being to discover that\nyoung children often include their pets within their defini-\ntions of their family!).\nThe serious theoretical issue lies in our understanding of\nhow such commonalities as there are emerge. The argu-\nment of evolutionary psychologists is that they are geneti-\ncally built into our behaviour as a result of evolutionary se-\nlection pressures. This is the line taken by Pinker (1997)\nfollowing for instance, Cosmides and Tooby (Barkow et al.\n1992). For them, behaviour and the mind are constructed\nfrom genetically fixed modules \u2013 Cosmides and Tooby\u2019s fa-\nmous Swiss army knife analogy. Of course this doesn\u2019t mean\n\u2013 and pace Alcock, Wells, and several other reviewers, I\nnever for one moment imply that it does \u2013 that such be-\nhaviour is unmodifiable; clearly the \u201cmodules\u201d are sup-\nposed to permit flexibility. (Incidentally, I did not invent the\nstory of pink-feathered flamingos \u2013 it first surfaced in an ac-\ncount by Thayer in 1909! I am grateful to Bateson (Bateson\n& Martin 1999) for the account of this piece of proto-\nadaptationism). There is no space to deal with this argu-\nment at length here (see Rose & Rose 2000). Suffice it to\nsay first that the innate modular argument (whose history\nstretches back to Plato) ignores both development\n(Karmiloff-Smith 1992) and the constructivist alternatives\noffered by Oyama (1986) and Ingold (1986; 2000; see also\nBateson 2000 for a clarification of the multiplicity of mean-\nings given to the term instinct), or even the connectionist\napproach of Elman et al. (1996). It is precisely the crudity\nof this view of innate modularity that the concept of au-\ntopoiesis counters.\nIt is the evolutionary psychologist\u2019s sense of biological \ndeterminism, not some fantasy of Alcock\u2019s imagining, that\nLifelines is concerned to counter, on both empirical and\ntheoretical grounds. Udry believes that there isn\u2019t enough\nbiological determinism about, though this claim to be a per-\nsecuted minority is clearly belied by the evidence of the\ncontinuing mass sales of many of the authors I have men-\ntioned. But the defenders of biological determinism want\nto have it both ways. Thus even though he, Steklis, Alcock,\nand others maintain that insofar as they do exist, evolution-\nary psychologists do not make the determinist claims I at-\ntribute to them, one only has to read Broude\u2019s shopping list\nto get a contradictory sense, though even she doesn\u2019t go so\nfar as offering, as some contemporary Murdockians have,\nchildren\u2019s alleged dislike and adults\u2019 liking for spinach, or\nearly morning sickness or \u201cfood cravings\u201d in pregnancy, as\nevolutionarily honed adaptations. Consider too Pinker\u2019s\n(1997) and Wilson\u2019s (1998) rooting of an alleged human\npreference for green landscapes to our evolutionary origins\nin the savannah. Their accounts often read like a scientific\nversion of The Flintstones \u2013 a projection of idealised US\nsuburban life circa 1955 back into the neolithic.\nThe empirical evidence for such claims is often ex-\ntremely shaky, and where it exists it is often much better ex-\nplained on proximate rather than distally causal grounds.\nWells refers to familial violence as a parent\u2013offspring con-\nflict. But what is an evolutionary psychologist to make of the\n(empirical) fact that violence by men against their female\npartners is particularly high during pregnancy, when the\nwomen are carrying their partner\u2019s child-to-be? Yet evo-\nlutionary psychologists, ignoring the huge differences in\nscale, prefer instead to dwell on the tiny number of mur-\nders by step-fathers of their offspring. I believe, along with\nanyone familiar with such evidence and not constrained by\na fundamentalist need to shoehorn all aspects of human ex-\nistence into a rigidly defined adaptationist framework, that\nproximal explanations at the social, economic, and personal\nlife-history level are likely to give us much more purchase\non understanding such phenomena than half-baked pseudo-\nDarwinism.\nI cite many examples of such biological determinist\nclaims in Lifelines, but here are some more for good mea-\nsure (and see also Brown 1999): \u201cour belief in morality is\nmerely an adaptation put in place to further our reproduc-\ntive ends\u201d (Wilson 1975, quoted by Dennett 1995); \u201c[the\nhuman mind is] equipped with a body of genetically deter-\nmined information specific to universal grammar\u201d (Smith &\nTsimpli 1995); \u201cthe mind is likely to contain blueprints for\nResponse\/Rose: Lifelines\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1999) 22:5 917\ngrammatical rules . . . and a special set of genes that help\nwire it in place\u201d (Pinker 1995); \u201cFrom pregnancy compli-\ncations, to the stress response, to the beauty in symmetry,\nto the attraction of money, to the historical tendency of the\nrich to favor firstborn sons, everything we think, feel and do\nmight be better understood as a means to the spread of our\nown \u2013 or of our ancestor\u2019s \u2013 genes\u201d (Betzig 1997).\nOr consider Hamilton\u2019s romantically racist eugenicism,\nexpressed in a paper delivered to a recent conference at the\nVatican Academy (Pontifical Academy 1998), where he ex-\nplained, to the distress of most of the other participants,\nthat he would willingly sacrifice \u201ca hundred unknown Chi-\nnese\u201d to save a panda from destruction. Claiming as Max-\nson and Steklis do, that such biological determinists allow\nfor epistasis and epigenetics scarcely addresses the point:\nany genetic effect has to work via epigenetic processes.\nWhen I turn to the question of behaviour genetics and neu-\nrogenetic determinism, I am not suggesting either that\ngenes are irrelevant to an understanding of human behav-\niour or that determinists believe their effects are unmedi-\nated. Nor has Maxson any grounds for claiming that I \u201cbe-\nlieve that most if not all [adaptations] involve selection at\nthe group rather than the individual level\u201d or that I believe\nthat heritability estimates are only suitable for nonhumans\n(but see Sober & Wilson, 1998, for an extremely useful\nreevaluation of the dogmatic anti-group selectionist ap-\nproach of many neo- as well as ultra-Darwinists; see also\nWilson & Sober: \u201cReintroducing Group Selection to the\nHuman Behavioral Sciences\u201d BBS 17(4) 1994). Maxson is\nof course right when he points out that Lifelines makes no\nreference to C. Elegans \u2013 however he misquotes and there-\nfore makes a nonsense of my statement on p. 4 that \u201cbio-\nchemical and genetic generalisations are still derived from\njust three organisms\u201d by omitting the two words italicised.\nThis distortion comes poorly from someone who claims that\nI quote out of context.\nThe reductive sequence I describe in Chapter 10 of Life-\nlines begins with questioning the validity of reifying and ob-\njectifying the \u201cbehaviour\u201d (in my major example, \u201cviolence\u201d\nor \u201caggression\u201d) and ends with a critique of the assumption\nof a genetic explanation as \u201cthe\u201d determining cause. As both\nFuller and Midgley recognise, the search for causal ex-\nplanations is also a search for efficacious sites of interven-\ntion, and it is in this sense that the attempts to explain \u201cvi-\nolence\u201d in society in terms of genes or MAOA inhibitors is\nat best irrelevant and at worst positively harmful, for the\nreasons that chapter set out. Crusio defends the conclu-\nsions of the Cases et al. (1995) paper against my critique be-\nfore describing an interesting experiment of his own with\nwhose modest interpretation I have no major problems. My\nobjection to the highlighting of \u201caggression\u201d in the Cases et\nal. paper is that the genetically modified mice the authors\ndescribe as aggressive also had so many other phenotypic\nabnormalities as to make this particular feature a rather\ntrivial aspect of their profoundly disabled lives, and the in-\nsouciance of the authors\u2019 response, described in Lifelines,\nemphasising this particular aspect of their mice\u2019s behaviour\nas a deliberate attempt to draw attention to their findings.\nWell indeed it has, and hence the rhetorical transmogrifi-\ncation to which Crusio refers must be seen as an interpre-\ntation (albeit metaphorical) of the authors\u2019 intentions.\nIn sum, I thank those many reviewers of Lifelines who\nhave reflected so thoughtfully on the issues it raises, and in\ndoing so have pushed me to think further and harder about\nseveral of its themes. As for the hornet\u2019s nest of behaviour\ngeneticists, I cannot say that I am surprised that I have\nstirred them up, but conclude that despite their buzzing,\nmy book has remained largely immune to their stings.\nReferences\nLetters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d appearing before authors\u2019 initials refer to target arti-\ncle and response, respectively.\nAhmed, S. & Koob, G.
