In this paper we argue that while this wisdom is true in the partial equilibrium setting\nof a monopolistic principal, in competitive markets with competing mechanisms this need not be true.\nIn particular, we show that the prevalence of prices over more general auction-like mechanisms crucially\ndepends on the features of the meeting technology. If buyers only rarely end up simultaneously bidding\nfor the same good, sellers choose price posting. In contrast, when buyers do tend to simultaneously\ncompete, for example in art or antique auctions, prices are dominated. Our findings highlight the role\nof the search process for mechanism design. The important insight here is that it is not necessarily\nthe fine details of the mechanism space that determine the competitive sales mechanism, but rather\nthe properties of the meeting process. We can thus characterize the prevalence of price posting as a\nfunction of the meeting technology.1\nThe role of the meeting technology can best be illustrated by considering two extreme versions\nthat are commonly assumed. First, consider a purely non-rival meeting technology, as is often done\nin much of the directed search literature. Buyers simultaneously meet a given seller and they all\ncontemporaneously compete for the good for sale. Each additional meeting by another buyer does\nnot affect one\u2019s chances of meeting with the seller. Key here is the distinction between meeting and\nmatching (or trade). Even if meeting is non-rival, the good itself is clearly rival: the more buyers meet,\nthe lower the trading probability. As an example of a non-rival meeting technology, consider a seller\nof a piece of art who fixes a date and time when the good will be sold. Irrespective of how many\nother buyers turn up, the opportunity to enter the auction is invariant. Second, consider a purely rival\nmeeting technology, as in much of the competitive search literature. At any given seller, there is always\nat most one buyer at the time. Another buyer\u2019s meeting clearly reduces one\u2019s own meeting probability.\nThis is often the case in environments without recall where in any small time interval there is at most\none meeting which must immediately end up in trade or separation. For example, a firm continuously\nhires and once a candidate turns up, a hiring decision is made.2 There is of course a whole continuum in\nbetween these extreme meeting technologies. Suppose several workers simultaneously apply for a job,\nbut the firm only considers say half of the applications (there could be many reasons: it is too costly,\nonly those that have been referred by trusted friends and colleagues are considered,...). This renders a\nmeeting technology partially rival. We are not aware of work that considers the impact of variations in\nthe meeting technology, and this work attempts to fill the gap.\nThe approach in most of the search literature is to assume a particular trading arrangement (typically\n1Price posting is pervasive in many economic transactions. Even the internet auction house eBay derives 40% of its\nrevenue from price posting. There could be many reasons why prices are pervasive, including low transaction costs (see for\nexample Wang (1993)). Our objective is to find out under which conditions price posting is an efficient trading mechanism\nin the presence of search frictions, and without assuming different transaction costs for other mechanisms.\n2The purely rival meeting technology is maintained in work by Moen (1997); Acemoglu and Shimer (1999); Mortensen\nand Wright (2002); Moen and Rosen (2006). The purely non-rival meeting technology is assumed in such work as Peters\n(1991, 1997a, 1997b, 1999, 2000); (1991); Peters and Severinov (1997); Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001); Shi (2001, 2002);\nShimer (2005). Even in random search, often a rival meeting function is assumed where bad types negatively affect good\ntypes (see for example Albrecht and Vroman (2002)), but alternatives with non-rival meeting technologies have recently\nbeen proposed (see for example Moscarini (2001) and Albrecht and Vroman (2002)).\n2\nprice posting, but in other instances also competition in auctions) without questioning whether this\nparticular mechanism would actually be chosen as an equilibrium outcome when a set of different\nmechanisms are available. In contrast, the competing mechanism design literature (McAfee (1993),\nPeters (1997b)) does ask what the equilibrium mechanism is, but it analyzes this in the presence of\na particular purely non-rival meeting technology only. They show that in their setting second price\nauctions are always a weak best reply for an individual seller. They derive an equilibrium where buyers\nvisit all sellers with equal probability, thus rendering visit strategies purely random. Once buyers turn\nup, sellers use the auctions for ex post screening.\nIn contrast, when sellers are restricted to using simple price posting mechanisms, they will offer\ndifferent prices for different buyer types to induce separation of buyers. Lower type buyers choose to\nvisit sellers who offer low prices and corresponding low odds of trade, while high type buyers consume\nat high prices and enjoy a high probability of trade. Such trading mechanism leads to ex ante sorting,\nwith buyers endogenously revealing their type in equilibrium by choosing the price at which they want\nto trade. Due to the separation, each seller knows exactly the type of buyer he faces, and has ex-post\nno incentive to use type-revealing mechanisms.\nA priori, it is not clear whether ex ante sorting or ex post screening will prevail in equilibrium.\nWe are interested in how the nature of the meeting process affects the equilibrium trading mechanism.\nIn particular, we investigate under which circumstances a simple price posting mechanism obtains in\nequilibrium. The key feature is to analyze posted prices as an equilibrium mechanism, even when\nother mechanisms are available. Our paper thus spans the literatures of directed\/competitive search\nand competing mechanisms design, and links the prevalence of posted price mechanisms tightly to the\nproperties of the meeting technology.\nWe have four distinct results that highlight how the equilibrium trading mechanism depends on\nthe meeting technology and the degree of heterogeneity in buyer preferences. First, in the absence of\nheterogeneity, we obtain an equivalence result independent of the exact nature of the meeting technology.\nFor any mechanism, seller revenues are identical conditional on leaving the same expected surplus to\nbuyers. Given revenue equivalence, sellers do not care whether they compete in posted prices, second\nprice auctions or other mechanisms, and therefore competition in posted prices does constitute an\nequilibrium. There is a continuum of other equilibria in different mechanisms, but in all equilibria visit\nstrategies are random and payoffs are invariant.\nOur second result concerns purely rival meetings and establishes that fixed price mechanisms consti-\ntute an equilibrium and it is constrained efficient. Extending the usual notion of constrained efficiency\nfor given fixed price mechanisms to encompass competition in larger classes of mechanisms, the key\nobservation is that random visit strategies are not efficient because this leaves sellers unsure about the\ntype of buyer they face. While there are still alternative ways of screening buyer types such as lotteries,\nincentive compatibility induces a cost in terms of wasteful destruction. More importantly, non-random\nvisit strategies outperform random visit strategies because meetings are rival: When low types enter the\nsame market as high types, then the probability of meeting a seller goes down for the high types. This\nmakes it beneficial to keep buyers apart in separate markets. Ex-post screening is then no longer nec-\nessary because efficiency requires sellers to go to different markets. These efficiency concerns also drive\n3\nequilibrium behavior, and sellers post different mechanisms that attract different buyer types. Since\nsorting leaves not residual uncertainty about the buyer types, again ex-post screening mechanisms are\nnot necessary and prices suffice to shift resources between buyers and sellers.\nOur third main result shows that the constrained efficiency and the equilibrium nature of fixed\nprice mechanisms does not carry over to purely non-rival meeting technologies. This arises even though\neach seller knows exactly the type of buyers that he faces in equilibrium when only fixed prices are\navailable, i.e., there is perfect sorting. Despite the fact that the well-known Hosios (1990) condition\nfor constrained efficiency is fulfilled for each market when only prices are available, other mechanisms\ngenerate higher surplus and are more profitable for an individual buyer. This has to do with the meeting\ntechnology: under ex post screening, visit strategies are random in equilibrium which leads to strictly\nmore meetings than non-random visit strategies. The gain from having more meetings is not eroded\nby the fact that low types search in the same market as high types, precisely because meetings are\nnon-rival. Therefore, random visit strategies of all buyer types in one market and allocating the good\nvia auctions is constrained efficient and arises in equilibrium. Even if all other sellers offer posted prices,\na single deviant can exploit the constrained efficiency gain of random visit strategies by having all buyer\ntypes visit him. This is consistent with the result in McAfee (1993) that second price auctions are weak\nbest replies in his setting with non-rival meetings.\nOur fourth result establishes that the prevalence of price posting as an equilibrium mechanism holds\ntrue generally for partially rival meeting technologies and does not exclusively hinge on the pure rival\nnature. As long as the degree of partial rivalry is high enough, ex ante sorting via price posting will\ndominate ex post screening. Even if there is some ex post competition and multiple buyers meet the\nseller, it is not in the interest of the seller to announce a mechanism that screens ex post. While ex-post\nscreening through auctions would arise in a partial equilibrium setting, in the presence of competition\nfrom other sellers, an individual seller attracts more buyers by announcing a fixed price mechanism and\nthus generates a higher surplus.3\nOur work relates to existing work on constrained efficiency in search markets. While the random\nsearch model is typically inefficient (Hosios 1990), Moen (1997) shows that in the competitive search\nmodel with identical agents and rival meetings, the price posting equilibrium is constrained efficient.\nHe considers a planner who faces the same meeting frictions and allocates the good with the same\nmechanisms (in his case, prices) as the agents in the decentralized economy. Then with quasi-linear\npreferences and in the presence of lump sum transfers, Pareto efficiency is equivalent to maximizing the\nsurplus of trade.\nOur contribution on the issue of efficiency is two-fold. From the equivalence result in the case\nof identical buyers, it follows that Moen\u2019s result extends beyond a non-rival meeting technology and\nfor different trading mechanisms. For heterogeneous buyers, we show that for purely rival and purely\nnon-rival meeting technologies, the equilibrium outcome \u2013 posted prices under purely rival meetings,\n3Observe that when price posting is an equilibrium, there may exist other equilibrium mechanisms that are payoff\nequivalent. For example, sellers may offer an auction with a reserve price that is high enough to attract only one type and\nthat therefore effectively does not screen ex post. This can generate the same expected surplus, which resembles our first\nresult for homogeneous agents.\n4\nsecond price auctions under purely non-rival meetings \u2013 is constrained efficient. We establish this result\nfor the pure private value case and abstract from any common-value components. In particular, we do\nnot consider adverse selection and associated lemon\u2019s problem. Guerrieri, Shimer and Wright (2009)\ncombine differences in valuations of buyers, as in our setting, with adverse selection for the seller.\nFocussing on purely rival meetings, their equilibrium features separation of types, confirming more\nbroadly the separation that we find in our environment. We conjecture that even in such a setting, the\nequilibrium will feature pooling once the rivalry becomes less severe, but since ours is the first step to\nsee the implications of different meeting technologies, such results are beyond the scope of the present\npaper.\nThe next section outlines and analyzes the model with homogeneous buyers for a general meeting\ntechnology that allows for any degree of partial rivalry, spanning from purely rival to purely non-rival\nspecifications. The third section extends the setup to encompass buyer heterogeneity. We focus on\ntwo buyer types for tractability, yet the analysis extends to any finite number of buyers. Section four\nanalyzes the outcome when sellers are restricted to post prices. Section five analyzes the equilibria\nand efficiency when other mechanisms are also available. The analysis covers the cases of multilateral\nmeetings (purely rival meetings), bilateral meetings (purely non-rival meetings), as well as those meeting\ntechnologies that are partially rival. Section six offers some concluding remarks.\n2 Homogeneous buyers\n2.1 The model\nConsider an economy with a measure s of homogeneous sellers and a measure b of buyers. We start here\nwith the case of homogeneous buyers, and later extend the setup to heterogeneous buyers. Sellers are\nendowed with one unit of a good for sale. Buyers have a valuation v for the good. If a buyer and a seller\ntrade at a transfer t from the buyer to the seller, then the buyer\u2019s payoff is v\u2212 t and the seller\u2019s payoff\nis t. Payoffs from no trade are normalized to zero. We are interested in trading procedures where search\nis directed in the sense that buyers can post a mechanism and sellers can choose which mechanism to\nparticipate in.\nThe Market Interaction. Each seller decides on a mechanism m from some Borel-measurable mech-\nanism space M, which we will define in detail below. The mechanisms posted by sellers can be sum-\nmarized by the measure \u00b5s, where \u00b5s(M) denotes the measure of sellers that post mechanisms in set\nM \u2282 M. Different mechanisms trade in different markets. Buyers can see which mechanisms are of-\nfered, and decide in which market to search.4 This means that they can direct their search towards the\nmechanisms they find most attractive. Their trading decisions can be summarized by measure \u00b5b, where\n\u00b5b(M) denotes the measure of buyers that search in markets that offer a mechanism in set M \u2282M. The\n4Following most of the literature, sellers are assumed to search only for one mechanisms. For simultaneous search for\nmultiple mechanisms see for example Albrecht, Gautier and Vroman (2006), Galenianos and Kircher (2009) and Kircher\n(2009).\n5\nmeasures cannot exceed the overall measure of agents in the population.5 The requirement that buyers\ncan only search for mechanisms that are actually offered by some sellers is captured by the assumption\nthat \u00b5b is absolutely continuous in \u00b5s. The Radon-Nikodym (RN) derivative \u03bb = d\u00b5b\/d\u00b5s then delivers\nthe buyer-seller ratio in each market place in the support of \u00b5s.6 Since \u03bb(m) depends on the mechanism\nthat is offered, sellers can affect the number of buyers that they attract by changing the mechanism\nthat they offer. The buyer-seller ratio will be crucial in determining the meeting probabilities between\nbuyers and sellers, and only the buyers that actually meet a seller can take part in the seller\u2019s posted\nmechanism.\nMeetings. If the ratio of buyers to sellers in a particular market is \u03bb, there is a probability Pn(\u03bb)\nthat n buyers will show up at a given seller. Pn is assumed to be twice differentiable. From a buyer\u2019s\nperspective, there is a probability Qn (\u03bb) that he arrives at a seller who has n buyers, with Q0(\u03bb) being\nthe probability of not finding any seller.7 Since buyers and sellers meet jointly, there is a particular\nconsistency condition that links Pn and Qn. When there are \u03c3 sellers and \u03b2 buyers in a market such\nthat \u03bb = \u03b2\/\u03c3, consistency requires for every n > 0 that\n\u03c3Pn(\u03bb) =\n\u03b2Qn(\u03bb)\nn\n.\nThe left hand side gives the number of sellers in a meeting with n buyers. The numerator on the right\nhand side gives the number of buyers in \u201cn-buyer\u201d meetings, and since there are n of them per seller\nthe denominator scales it down to the number of sellers in such meetings. Rearranging this equation\ngives\nnPn(\u03bb) = \u03bbQn(\u03bb). (1)\nFor n = 0 the fact that probabilities add to unity implies that Q0(\u03bb) = 1\u2212\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1Qn(\u03bb). We also require\nthat for any \u03bb > 0 there are some meetings, i.e. 0 < 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb), but due to frictions not all sellers meet\na buyer, i.e. 0 < P0(\u03bb). Moreover, we require that a higher buyer-seller ratio increases the meeting\nchances for a seller, i.e., we assume that the probability that no buyer shows up strictly decreases in \u03bb\nand that the probability of meeting less than N buyers decreases (and the probability of meeting more\nthan N buyers increases). Formally, we assume a shift in terms of first order stochastic dominance:\nP \u20320(\u03bb) < 0 and (2)\nN\u2211\nn=0\nP \u2032n(\u03bb) \u2264 0 for all N.\n5For sellers there always exists a weakly profitable mechanism (e.g., a positive price), and therefore we require \u00b5s(M) =\ns. Sellers might not see any mechanism in the support of \u00b5s that gives them a higher payoff then abstaining, and therefore\nwe only require \u00b5b(M) \u2264 b.\n6The Radon-Nikodym derivative is almost everywhere unique on the support of \u00b5 in the sense any two RN-derivative\ncoincide almost everywhere. To have well-defined payoffs, we also assume a selection device that selects a unique RN\nderivative.\n7Our meeting technology is inherently static, but it can capture the notion of a dynamic search process. For example,\nPinheiro (2008) proposes a dynamic model where the number of traders that meet the seller is a function of the time spent\nsearching.\n6\nThe first line is assumed throughout the literature to capture the idea that more buyers per seller makes\nit easier for a seller to find some buyer to trade with. Our main extension is in the second line which\ncovers meetings with multiple buyers. The higher the buyer-seller ratio, the higher the number of buyers\nthat will arrive (in stochastic terms). For the buyers, we assume a similar property. In particular, we\nassume that the distribution satisfies first order stochastic dominance, i.e.\n\u2211\u221e\nn=N Q\n\u2032\nn(\u03bb) \u2264 0 for all\nN with strict inequality for some N. This immediately implies that\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1\nQ\u2032n(\u03bb)\nn < 0, which in turns\nimplies the following relationship that will be useful later on: 1 + \u03bbP \u20320(\u03bb?)\u2212 P0(\u03bb?) > 0.8\nAdditionally we assume that\nP0 is strictly convex. (3)\nThis convexity property has to hold for some \u03bb \u2208 [0,\u221e) since P0(\u03bb) \u2208 [0, 1] is bounded, and we make\nthe standard assumption that this property extends to the entire domain. Again, this condition is\nstandard in the literature.\nExamples: The standard example in the directed search literature is that buyers randomly visit one\nof the sellers that offers the mechanism that they like. Clearly the probability that the buyer meets a\nsellers is one, and the only question is how many other buyers are present. The randomness in a given\nmarket leads to a Poisson distribution Pn(\u03bb) = \u03bb\nne\u2212\u03bb\nn! (and associated Qn(\u03bb) =\n\u03bbn\u22121e\u2212\u03bb\n(n\u22121)! when n > 0).\nA specification from the monetary literature (see e.g. Kiyotaki and Wright (1993)) is one where agents\nare randomly matched into pairs, and trade only if the pair includes a buyer and a seller. If a seller is\npaired with another seller, there is no meeting that can lead to trade. For a seller, the probability to\nbe in a meeting with a buyer rather than with another seller when there are \u03c3 sellers and \u03b2 buyers is\nP1(\u03bb) = \u03c3\u03c3+\u03b2 =\n\u03bb\n1+\u03bb . The probability of a meeting without any buyers is P0(\u03bb) = 1\u2212P1(\u03bb), and clearly\nit is impossible to meet more than one buyer so that Pn(\u03bb) = 0 for n > 1.\nMechanisms. Sellers compete in mechanisms from some Borel-measurable set M with the following\nrestrictions. We require that M includes the set of all fixed price mechanisms, i.e., sellers post a price\nand sell at this price to one of the buyers that show up. If several buyers show up the seller picks one\nat random to whom to sell. We require the set M to include only anonymous mechanisms that do\nnot condition on the other mechanisms that are present.9 In particular, a mechanism specifies for each\nnumber n of sellers some extensive form game \u0393nm that induces some expected payoff pi\nm\nn for the seller\nand some expected payoff umn for each of the buyers.\n10 Since only a surplus v is realized, we require that\nthe payoffs at each end node of \u0393nm sum to weakly less than v. This immediately implies pi\nm\nn +nu\nm\nn \u2264 v.\n8Since (1 \u2212 P0(\u03bb)) = P\u221en=1 \u03bbQn(\u03bb)n we have that \u2212 1\u2212P0(\u03bb)+\u03bbP \u20320(\u03bb)\u03bb2 = P\u221en=1 Q\u2032n(\u03bb)n , and the result follows fromP\u221e\nn=1\nQ\u2032n(\u03bb)\nn\n< 0.\n9Since buyers observe all other mechanisms, the seller could elicit information about other sellers from the buyers. This\nis ruled out by assumption in most of the literature such as McAffee (1993) or Peters (1997b, 1999). In large economies or\nin a pure strategy equilibrium in a finite economy each seller knows the distribution of other mechanisms with certainty,\nand there is no benefit from conditioning on other mechanisms when no seller does so. Therefore, equilibria survive even if\nsellers can condition on the mechanisms offered by other sellers. Yet additional equilibria can arise. For a deeper discussion\nand modeling of mechanisms that condition on other mechanisms, see Epstein and Peters (1999) and Peters (2001).\n10If the game has multiple equilibria and therefore multiple expected payoffs, we assume additionally that the seller can\npost an equilibrium selection device Sm. In general this is not an issue because when there are alternative games (such as\ndirect commitment to the payoffs) that give the desired outcome uniquely.\n7\nThe mechanisms do not have to obey any participation constraints, as sellers can always choose to stay\naway from any mechanism if their expected payoffs (averaged over the expectation of n, the number of\nother buyers that are expected to turn up) is too low.11 Obviously if there are no buyers, then um0 = 0\nand pim0 = 0.\nExamples: Fixed price mechanisms where sellers post price p have payoffs pin = p and un = [1 \u2212 p]\/n\nconditional on being in a meeting with n buyers. Other feasible mechanisms include first price auctions,\nsecond price auctions, all-pay auctions with reserve price, as well as more esoteric mechanisms such as:\nIf no more than 5 buyers show up, one of them gets the good for free. If more than 5 buyers show\nup, each has to pay a price p and one gets the good. This yields payoffs pin = 0 and un = 1\/n for\nn \u2208 {1, .., 5} and pin = np and un = 1\/n\u2212 p for n \u2208 {6, 7, ...}.\nPayoffs. Consider the expected payoffs for an individual agent when the trading strategies of the other\nagents are summarized by \u00b5s and \u00b5b. The agent understands how crowded all markets are. Consider\nfirst the expected payoff to a buyer who chooses some mechanisms in the support of \u00b5s :\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1\nQn(\u03bb(m))umn , (4)\nwhich simply captures the probability of being in a match with n buyers times the payoff from playing\nthe mechanism. Similarly, a seller who offers a mechanisms in the support of \u00b5s obtains expected\nprofits:\n\u03a0(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb(m))pimn . (5)\nFinally, we have to specify the payoffs that a seller expects to obtain if he offered a mechanism that no\nother seller is offering, i.e., if he posts m outside of the support of \u00b5s. At this point the buyer-seller ratio\nis not tied down by the trading strategies \u00b5b and \u00b5s in the sense that the Radon-Nikodym derivative\nis arbitrary. We complete the specification following the literature (e.g. Acemoglu and Shimer 1999,\nEeckhout and Kircher 2009) by appealing to a notion of subgame perfection. It requires that the buyer-\nseller ratio that a deviant expects gives buyers as high a payoff as they would obtain elsewhere in the\nmarket. Formally, let the queue length \u03bb(m) at a deviant who offers mechanisms m outside the support\nof \u00b5s satisfy \u2211\u221e\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb(m))pimn = sup\nm\u2208supp\u00b5s\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b), (6)\nif this equality can be achieved for some \u03bb(m) > 0, and otherwise let \u03bb(m) = 0.12 This specification\ncaptures the following idea: A strictly positive buyer-seller ratio means that some buyers must be willing\nto search for the deviant. These sellers would only be willing to do so if the utility from searching in\nthe market of the deviant (left hand side) is at least as high as the utility they get on the equilibrium\npath (right hand side). The utility at the deviant can also not be strictly higher than the utility on the\nequilibrium path, because in this case all buyers would want to search in his market which would drive\nup the buyer-seller ratio. While this is an informal argument, (6) can be derived as the subgame perfect\n11If they arrive they are assumed to sign an agreement to participate before n is revealed.\n12In connection with Footnote 6, existence of an equilibrium requires the selection device to fulfill (6) even on the\nsupport of \u00b5s if possible.\n8\nequilibrium of particular finite market games when the market size grows large (see e.g. Peters 1991,\n1997a, 1997b, 2000). For many mechanisms such as price setting and standard auctions, (6) determines\nthe queue length uniquely. In case of multiplicity, we follow McAffee (1993) and others and assume\nthat the seller believes that he can coordinate buyers in the way that is most desirable to him. Given\n\u03bb(m), payoffs are determined as in (5).\nEquilibrium. We define an equilibrium as a large game (Mas-Colell 1984), where each agent individ-\nually acts optimally, taking the overall trading strategies of the other agents as given. An equilibrium\nis a tuple (\u00b5s, \u00b5b) such that\n1. Seller Optimality: \u03a0(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) \u2265 \u03a0(m\u2032|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) for any m in the support of \u00b5s and any m\u2032 \u2208M.\n2. Buyer Optimality: U(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) \u2265 U(m\u2032|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) for any m in the support of \u00b5b and any m\u2032 in the\nsupport of \u00b5s.\nConstrained Efficiency. Consider a social planner who faces the same restrictions as the decentralized\neconomy. In particular, he can choose the trading strategies (\u00b5s, \u00b5b), but is subject to the same meeting\nand information frictions and the same set of feasible trading mechanisms as the decentralized economy.\nDue to quasi-linear preferences, Pareto-optimality is equivalent to maximizing surplus (if lump-sum\ntransfers are available). Therefore, a tuple (\u00b5s, \u00b5b) is constrained efficient if the associated RN-derivative\n\u03bb generates surplus that is larger than the surplus generated by any other (\u00b5\u2032s, \u00b5\u2032b) and associated RN-\nderivative \u03bb\u2032. That means:\ns\n\u222b\nM\n[\u2211\nn\nPn(\u03bb(m))(pimn + nu\nm\nn )\n]\nd\u00b5s \u2265 s\n\u222b\nM\n[\u2211\nn\nPn(\u03bb\u2032(m))(pimn + nu\nm\nn )\n]\nd\u00b5\u2032s.\nClearly, if the meeting frictions are reduced or the set of mechanisms is increased, the constraints on\nthe planner become less severe and higher levels of surplus might become possible.\nRandom Visit Strategies. Some of our results hinge on the degree of directedness of the visit\nstrategies of the buyers. In equilibrium, relatively more buyers might search for some mechanisms than\nfor others, or they may search equally across all mechanisms. The latter means that the buyer-seller\nratio \u00b5b(M)\/\u00b5s(M) = b\/s is constant across all sets M \u2282supp\u00b5s offered mechanisms, which equivalently\nmeans that the RN-derivative \u03bb(m) = b\/s is constant across all m \u2208supp\u00b5s. We call this \u201crandom visit\nstrategies\u201d since in equilibrium the strategies appear random, even though a deviating seller would\nattract a different amount of buyers.\n2.2 Analysis\nWe will show that there is an equilibrium in fixed prices in this setting, and also every other class of\nmechanisms that allows the surplus to be shifted between buyers and sellers (e.g., by means of a reserve\nprice in an auction) includes mechanisms that constitute an equilibrium.\n9\nConsider first the problem of an individual seller. In equilibrium, he maximizes (5) knowing that\nhis queue length is determined according to (6). This holds off the equilibrium path by assumption and\non the equilibrium path by the second equilibrium condition. Therefore, in equilibrium his choice of\nmechanism and the resulting queue length solve:\nmax\n\u03bb\u2208R+,m\u2208M\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb)pimn (7)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nQn(\u03bb)umn \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (8)\nwhere U? = supm\u2208supp\u00b5s U(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b) represents the utility that buyers can get at other sellers. The\nconstraint represent (6), and so the program clearly reflects the equilibrium conditions when (6) deter-\nmines the buyer-seller ratio uniquely. If this is not the case, the mechanism has to give the queue length\nthat is best for the seller. The reason is that the seller always has the option to deviate and choose a\nmechanism that implements the desired queue length uniquely and gives at least the same revenues,\nfor example by choosing a fixed price.13\nAssume that the space of mechanisms includes mechanisms such that any umn and pi\nm\nn with nu\nm\nn +\npimn \u2264 1 is feasible.14 For a given U? we call a mechanism m full-trade mechanism if numn + pimn = 1.\nThat is, the mechanism induces trade with certainty.\nLemma 1 Given U?, any mechanism m \u2208M that is not a full-trade mechanism is revenue-dominated\nby a full-trade mechanism m\u2032 \u2208M with queue \u03bb(m\u2032).\nProof. Mechanism m has numn +pi\nm\nn < 1. Let m\n\u2032 give identical utilities to buyers um\u2032n = umn but different\nprofit pi\u2032n = 1\u2212 numn + pimn to the seller. Clearly, buyers obtain identical payoffs and thus \u03bb(m\u2032) = \u03bb(m)\nis feasible, but the seller achieves weakly higher profits when n buyers arrive. If Pn(\u03bb(m)) > 0, the\nfull-trade mechanism yields strictly higher profits.\nTherefore, for equilibrium play we only have to restrict attention to full-trade mechanisms. For the\nfollowing proposition, let with slight abuse of notation \u03a0(m,\u03bb) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 Pn(\u03bb)pi\nm\nn be the expected seller\npayoff for a mechanism m with feasible queue \u03bb according to (8) and let U(m,\u03bb) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1Qn(\u03bb)u\nm\nn the\nexpected buyer utilities.\nProposition 1 (Equivalence Result) For given U?, consider some full-trade mechanism m \u2208 M with\nfeasible \u03bb > 0. Any other full-trade mechanism m\u2032 with U(m\u2032, \u03bb) = U(m,\u03bb) achieves \u03a0(m\u2032, \u03bb) =\n\u03a0(m,\u03bb).\nProof. The queue length \u03bb satisfies (8) for mechanism m means that U(m,\u03bb) = U?. Since U(m\u2032, \u03bb) =\nU(m,\u03bb), \u03bb also solves (8) for mechanism m\u2032. Since m is a full-trade mechanism, we have 1\u2212numn = pimn\n13It can be shown that under price posting (6) selects a queue length uniquely, and for a given queue length it yields\nhigher profits than any other mechanism. See Proposition (1).\n14Any sequence umn and pi\nm\nn can be implemented by a mechanism that charges price pn to all buyers, and trade occurs\nwith probability \u03b1n (in which case one of the buyers is selected at random): pn = pi\nm\nn \/n and \u03b1n = n[u\nm\nn + p\u2212 1].\n10\nand therefore\n\u03a0(m,\u03bb) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb)pimn =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb)[1\u2212 numn ]\n= 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb)numn\n= 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\u2212 \u03bb\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nQn(\u03bb)umn\n= 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\u2212 \u03bbU(m,\u03bb),\nwhere the third line follows from (1). Similarly, since m\u2032 is also a full-trade mechanism we have\n\u03a0(m\u2032, \u03bb) = 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\u2212 \u03bbU(m\u2032, \u03bb). Since U(m\u2032, \u03bb) = U(m,\u03bb) we have \u03a0(m\u2032, \u03bb) = \u03a0(m,\u03bb).\nWe call a class of mechanisms payoff-complete if for any \u03bb > 0 and any U there exists a mechanisms\nsuch that U(m,\u03bb) = U. Clearly the class of price posting mechanisms is complete, since U(p, \u03bb) =\u2211\u221e\nn=1Qn(\u03bb)[1 \u2212 p]\/n and Q1(\u03bb) > 0 [as P1(\u03bb) > 0]. Similarly, the class of second price auctions with\nreserve price is complete: since Q1(\u03bb) is positive, the reserve price \u2013 which can be negative \u2013 can be\nadjusted to yield the right payoff to buyers. Also, the set of mechanisms that offer with probability\n\u03b3 a fixed price and with probability (1 \u2212 \u03b3) give the good away for free is complete. Proposition 1\nimplies that for any U?, if there is an optimal mechanism, there is an optimal mechanisms within any\npayoff-complete class of mechanisms.\nProposition 2 There exists an equilibrium in any class of payoff-complete full-trade mechanisms, and\nthe equilibrium is constrained efficient. It remains an equilibrium and remains constrained efficient\neven if additional mechanisms become available. The expected payoffs are identical in every equilibrium\nas long as sellers compete in a class of payoff-complete full-trade mechanisms.\nProof. We will prove existence in the space of second-price auctions with reserve price. The second\nand third statement follow immediately from our Equivalence Proposition 1: the same expected payoffs\nyield an equilibrium in any other payoff-complete class of full-trade mechanisms such as price posting.\nFor a given reserve r the seller gets pi1 = r and the buyer u1 = 1 \u2212 r if one buyer arrives. If more\nbuyers arrive the seller gets pin = 1 and the buyers get un = 0. Payoffs with reserve r are therefore\ngiven by \u03a0(r, \u03bb) = P1(\u03bb)r + (1 \u2212 P1(\u03bb) \u2212 P2(\u03bb)) and U(r \u03bb) = Q1(\u03bb)(1 \u2212 r). For a given U?, first\norder stochastic dominance condition (2) implies that under the optimal \u03bb constraint (8) binds. Sellers\ntherefore maximize\nmax\nr\nP1(\u03bb)r + (1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\u2212 P1(\u03bb))\ns.t.\nP1(\u03bb)\n\u03bb\n(1\u2212 r) = U?.\n11\nSubstituting out the constraint leaves\nmax\n\u03bb\n1\u2212 \u03bbU? \u2212 P0(\u03bb).\nSince P0 is strictly convex, each seller has a unique optimum, and therefore an equilibrium has all sellers\nposting the same reserve price r. It is characterized by the unique first order condition\n\u2212P \u20320(\u03bb) = U?.\nSince all sellers in equilibrium post the same r, they will face a queue length of \u03bb? = b\/s. Therefore\nequilibrium utility U? = \u2212P \u20320(\u03bb?), yielding equilibrium profits of 1 + \u03bbP \u20320(\u03bb?) \u2212 P0(\u03bb?), which means\nthat the equilibrium reserve price is\nr? = 1 +\n\u03bb?P \u20320(\u03bb?)\nP1(\u03bb?)\n.\nEfficiency follows because in equilibrium visit strategies are random. We elaborate on that point below.\nThe reserve price r? can in general be different from zero. Therefore, Peters\u2019 (1997) conjecture that\nthe reserve price in the homogeneous agent case may lie in the open set (0, 1) obtains for many meeting\nspecifications. For the specific urn-ball meeting technology of the directed search literature that Peters\n(1997) considers this is not true, though.\nCorollary 1 Under urn-ball meetings (Pn(\u03bb) = \u03bb\nne\u2212\u03bb\nn! ) the equilibrium second price auction has a\nreserve price r? = 0.\nTogether with the previous proposition this clarifies why under urn-ball meetings competition in\nfixed prices leads to the same surplus as in the case when sellers do not post anything but simply run\nsecond price auctions without reserve (Kultti, 1999): If sellers could compete in auctions, they would\nindeed choose to set a zero reserve under urn-ball meetings. Different meeting technologies would lead\nto a different reserve price, though. While we have compared different equilibria so far, the combination\nof Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 readily yield the following multiplicity of mechanisms within the\nsame equilibrium. It arises when sellers have alternative mechanisms available that generate the same\nexpected surplus for the buyers, such as fixed prices and second price auctions.\nCorollary 2 If the mechanism space contains to disjoint classes of payoff-complete full-trade mech-\nanisms, there exists a continuum of equilibria in which sellers announce different payoff-equivalent\nmechanisms.\nFinally, we relate our findings to the constrained efficiency of random visit strategies.\nCorollary 3 Since the equilibrium is in random visit strategies, it is constrained efficient in the sense\nof creating the highest number of trades at mechanisms that have full trade.\n12\nTo see the constrained efficiency result, observe that a necessary requirement for constrained effi-\nciency is that sellers offer full trade mechanisms. Let MF be the set of full-trade mechanisms, which\nincludes all fixed-price mechanisms. Full-trade ensures that every time a seller is present, the good\nis exchanged. Apart from this, constrained efficiency then means to maximize the number of trades.\nObserve that the number of trades is maximized under\nmax\n\u00b5s,\u00b5b\ns\n\u222b\n[1\u2212 P0(\u03bb(m))] d\u00b5s\ns.t. \u03bb = d\u00b5b\/d\u00b5s, \u00b5s(MF ) = s, \u00b5b(MF ) \u2264 b.\nThe strict concavity of [1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)] immediately implies that the solution to this program has \u03bb(m) = b\/s\nconstant for all mechanisms in the support of \u00b5s, i.e., the efficient allocation features random visit\nstrategies.\nNote again why in equilibrium all sellers always have the same queue length, no matter which class of\npayoff-complete full-trade mechanisms they compete in. Suppose this were not the case and there exist\nat least two sets of firms that face different queue lengths in equilibrium. From revenue equivalence,\nthese firms could post second price auctions, possibly with different reserve prices. But because there is\na unique solution to the first order condition of a seller posting an auction (see proof of Proposition 2),\nand given concavity of the seller\u2019s profit function, there can only be one optimal auction and associated\nreserve price. By revenue equivalence, at least one of the mechanisms that the firms initially announced\ndoes not maximize profits, therefore contradicting that firms face different queue lengths.\nTherefore, whenever the market utility assumption holds in the limit of finite economies as the\npopulation size grows large, the same expected equilibrium payoffs arise no matter the class of mecha-\nnisms in which the sellers compete (as long as the class is payoff-complete). This result highlights why\ncompetition in prices (e.g. the limit in Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001)) yields the same expected profit\nas competition in auctions (see e.g. Julien, Kennes and King (2000)). The market utility assumption\nholds for particular price posting games (Peters 1991, 1997), and holds for competition in more general\nmechanisms as long as long as sellers compete in a bounded payoff space (Virag 2007). Of course, this\nequivalence in expected payoffs holds only in the limit. In a finite economy, changes in the announce-\nment of an individual seller changes the market utility of the buyers due to market power, and multiple\nequilibria are possible.15\n3 Heterogeneous buyers\nConsider the extended model with two buyer types: measure b of low type buyers and measure b of\nhigh type buyers. As before, there is a measure s of homogeneous sellers. The low buyer type has a\nvaluation v > 0 for the good, the high buyer type has valuation v > v, and sellers have no value for the\ngood or cost of production. Again, utilities are linear in the amount of money that is transferred, and\n15For a finite agent model with a continuum of equilibria, including asymmetric ones where the queue length of one\nfirm is larger than the other, see Coles and Eeckhout (2003). See also Galenianos, Kircher and Virag (forthcoming) for an\nelaboration on market power in finite economies.\n13\npayoffs from no trade are normalized to zero.\nThe Market Interaction. The market interaction is essentially unchanged from the previous section.\n\u00b5s(M) still denotes the measure of sellers that post mechanisms in set M \u2282M. The trading decisions by\nbuyers are now summarized by two measures, \u00b5\nb\nand \u00b5b, for the low and high buyer types, respectively.\nBoth are required to be absolutely continuous in \u00b5s. Now the buyer-seller ratios for each type are\n\u03bb = d\u00b5\nb\n\/d\u00b5s and \u03bb = d\u00b5\u00afb\/d\u00b5s, and the total buyer-seller ratio is \u03bb = \u03bb+ \u03bb.\nMeetings. Meetings happen exactly as in the previous section, i.e., the definitions of the probabilities\nPn(\u03bb) and Qn(\u03bb) are unchanged. We also assume that the type of the buyer does not affect his chances\nof meeting a seller. It might affect his probability of trade since the mechanism might distinguish\nbetween types, but the probability of getting to the mechanism is type-independent.16 Therefore,\nfrom the seller\u2019s perspective, the probability of being in a match with n low and n high types is\nP\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) = Pn+n(\u03bb+\u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) where Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) is the binomial probability of drawing n low types\nout of all n + n buyers, when the probability of drawing one low type is \u03bb\/(\u03bb + \u03bb). For a buyer who\nmeets a seller, the probability of being in a match with n + n other buyers of which n are low types\nand n high types is Q\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) = Qn+n+1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb).\nMechanisms. A mechanism now specifies for a given number n of low type buyers and n of high\ntype buyers the expected payoff pimn,n for the seller and u\nm\nn,n (u\nm\nn,n) for low (high) valuation buyers. The\npayoffs have to be implemented in a way such that buyers are willing to truthfully reveal their type.\nTo specify this constraint, it is useful to decompose the payoffs into the probability of trade xmn,n (x\nm\nn,n)\nfor low (high) valuation buyers when n low valuation and n high valuation buyers are present. Clearly\nprobabilities cannot add to more than unity, i.e. n xmn,n + n x\nm\nn,n \u2264 1, and the seller cannot give out\nmore surplus than is created\npimn,n + n u\nm\nn,n + n u\nm\nn,n \u2264 n xmn,n v + n xmn,n v, (9)\nor in ex-ante terms\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\npimn,n + n u\nm\nn,n + n u\nm\nn,n\n] \u2264 \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\nn xmn,n v + n x\nm\nn,n v\n]\n. (10)\nIncentive compatibility constraints require that a low type buyer is willing to reveal his type, i.e., the\npayoff he receives is higher than the payoff when pretending to be a high type. Ex-ante incentive\ncompatibility is therefore:\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn+1,n \u2265\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\numn,n+1 + x\nm\nn,n+1(v \u2212 v)\n]\n(11)\n16We do not model different search intensities for the buyers. If differences in search intensity were introduced, the\nnumber of buyers in the market would have to be weighted by their respective search intensity.\n14\nThe left hand side is the payoff when announcing to be a low type. The right hand side is the payoff\nwhen pretending to be the high type. The right hand side comprises the payoff that the high type would\nobtain, adjusted for the fact that the low type only obtains v instead of v when he trades. Similarly,\nthe high type is willing to reveal his type if\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\numn+1,n + x\nm\nn+1,n(v \u2212 v)\n] \u2264 \u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn,n+1 (12)\nHere the right hand side is the payoff for the high type, and the left hand side is the payoff of the low\ntype adjusted for the fact that the high type obtains more when trading.\nPayoffs. Given the trading strategies of all other agents, the payoffs from choosing m \u2208supp\u00b5s for an\nindividual seller and a low and high type buyer, respectively, are\n\u03a0(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)pimn,n, (13)\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn+1,n, (14)\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn,n+1. (15)\nThe buyer-seller ratio for a deviating seller is again given by the indifference of the buyers. The deviating\nseller expects (\u03bb(m), \u03bb(m)). His expectation can only include \u03bb(m) > 0 if buyers are indeed willing to\ncome to his mechanism rather than to the mechanisms offered on the equilibrium path:\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb(m), \u03bb(m))umn+1,n = max\nm\u2208M\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b). (16)\nSimilarly, he can expect \u03bb(m) > 0 only if\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb(m), \u03bb(m))umn,n+1 = max\nm\u2208M\nU(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b). (17)\nSimilar to the previous section, for most mechanisms including price posting or standard auctions the\npair (\u03bb(m), \u03bb(m)) that satisfies (16) and (17) is unique. For mechanisms where multiplicity is possible,\nwe again follow McAffee (1993) and others and assume that the seller believes that he can coordinate\nbuyers and choose the combination of queue length that is most desirable to him.\nEquilibrium. An equilibrium is a tuple (\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) such that\n1. Seller Optimality: Any m \u2208supp\u00b5s solves maxm\u2032\u2208M\u03a0(m\u2032|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b).\n15\n2. Low Buyer Optimality: Any m \u2208supp\u00b5\nb\nsolves maxm\u2032\u2208supp\u00b5s U(m\u2032|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b).\n3. High Buyer Optimality: Any m \u2208supp\u00b5b solves maxm\u2032\u2208supp\u00b5s U(m\u2032|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b).\nConstrained Efficiency. Consider again a planner who can determine the trading strategies, but\nis constrained by the same meeting frictions and available trading mechanisms as the decentralized\nequilibrium. A tuple (\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) is constrained efficient if the resulting RN-derivatives \u03bb(m) and \u03bb(m)\ngenerate a higher surplus s\n\u222b\nM\n[\u2211\u221e\nn=0\n\u2211\u221e\nn=0 Pn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n(\npimn,n + n u\nm\nn,n + n u\nm\nn,n\n)]\nd\u00b5s than the re-\nspective surplus under any other tuple (\u00b5\u2032s, \u00b5\u2032b, \u00b5\n\u2032\nb) and its resulting RN-derivatives.\nPreliminaries. Similar to the derivation of maximization problem (7) in the homogeneous buyer\ncase, an individual seller now anticipates that his queue length arises according to (16) and (17). He\nmaximizes his expected profits, understanding that the number of buyers is governed by (16) and\n(17). Given the market utility U? = maxm\u2208M U(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b) and U\n? = maxm\u2208M U(m|\u00b5s, \u00b5b, \u00b5b), this\namounts to the problem\nmax\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+, m\u2208M\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)pimn,n (18)\nsuch that\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn+1,n \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (19)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)umn,n+1 \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (20)\nand incentive compatibility constraints for truthful type revelation (11) and (12) and the resource\nconstraint (9) have to hold. The constraints ensure thus (16) and (17) indeed apply.17 This formulation\nresembles the standard mechanism design approach: Buyers offer transfers and trading probabilities\nsuch that types are revealed and participation constraints are met, only now the level of the participation\nconstraint is endogenous.\n4 Price Posting Mechanisms\nConsider first the set of equilibria in a price posting environment. Under price posting, the good is\nallocated indiscriminately and with equal probability to any one of the buyers that arrives. The surplus\nthen is\npimn,n + n u\nm\nn,n + n u\nm\nn,n =\nn\nn+ n\nv +\nn\nn+ n\nv \u2264 n v + n v.\n17Again, the buyer-seller ratios are choice variables even if the constraints permit several solution because we assumed\nthat off equilibrium path the seller can coordinate the buyers. On the equilibrium path, this still holds if the seller has\ndeviations available to him that allow such a coordination of the equilibrium path, e.g. when other mechanisms achieve\nthe same expected payoffs but implement the desired buyer-seller ratios uniquely. It can be shown that a combination of\nauctions and prices does indeed achieve this.\n16\nFull surplus is only realized if n or n is equal to zero. A price p induces payoffs pin,n(p) = p if\neither n or n or both are strictly positive, and one of the buyers obtains the good at random so that\nun,n(p) =\nv\u2212p\nn+n and u\nm\nn,n =\nv\u2212p\nn+n . Taking U\n? and U? as given, we can consider (18) for an individual\nfirm. For price posting mechanisms the maximization becomes particularly simple: the seller only cares\nabout the probability of trade times the price [1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb)]p, while the buyers only care about their\nprobability of trade times their gain\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1Qn(\u03bb + \u03bb)\nv\u2212p\nn . Using nPn(\u03bb) = \u03bbQn(\u03bb) from (1) we get\u2211\u221e\nn=1Qn(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\/n = [1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb)]\/(\u03bb+ \u03bb) and therefore\nmax\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+,p\u2208R+\n[1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb)]p (21)\nsuch that\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\n[v \u2212 p] \u2264 U?,with equality if \u03bb > 0, (22)\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\n[v \u2212 p] \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0. (23)\nNote that in this case we can omit the truth-telling constraint as the seller will always choose to trade\nwith the buyer type where he can achieve the highest queue length \u03bb = \u03bb+ \u03bb and the other type then\nis either indifferent or strictly prefers not to appear. We first show:\nLemma 2 For given U? and U?, consider the restricted problem (21) where the price is fixed and only\n(\u03bb, \u03bb) are chosen optimally: There exists p\u02c6 such that at prices below p\u02c6 the solution has \u03bb = 0 and only\nlow types are attracted, while at prices above p\u02c6 the solution has \u03bb = 0 and only high types are attracted.\nMoreover, in the full problem (21) where the price is also chosen optimally, setting a price of p\u02c6 is never\noptimal, and a seller restricted to the set of prices [0, p\u02c6] (or restricted to [p\u02c6,\u221e)) has a unique optimal\nprice within that set.\nProof. Consider the restricted problem (21) where the price p is given. As long p < v\u00af, the optimal\nqueue lengths maximize \u03bb = \u03bb + \u03bb such that at least one constraints is still met at equality. If the\nconstraint holds with equality we have (1\u2212P0(\u03bb))\u03bb [v \u2212 p] = C for some C which implicitly defines \u03bb, and\nimplicit differentiation gives\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202p\n= \u2212 (1\u2212 P0(\u03bb))\u03bb\n(1\u2212 P0(\u03bb) + \u03bbP \u20320(\u03bb)) (v \u2212 p)\n,\nwhich is negative and strictly increasing in v. This single crossing property immediately implies that\nthere exists some price p\u02c6 such that at price p < p\u02c6 the optimal \u03bb has the low type\u2019s constraint (22)\nbinding, while at p > p\u02c6 the optimal \u03bb has the high type\u2019s constraint (23) binding. It also implies that\nno seller would like to cater to both low and high types by offering p\u02c6 : if it is profitable to increase one\u2019s\nprice up to p\u02c6 even though the queue length is falling a lot when trading with low types, it will clearly\nbe profitable to increase it strictly above p\u02c6 because there the queue length is falling less drastically due\nto a price change. We will make this argument precise below.\n17\nWe know that a seller who sells at a price below p\u02c6 will have a queue length determined by (22)\nholding with equality. Substituting the constraint, the optimal utility of such a seller is given by the\noptimization problem\nmax\n\u03bb\u2208[\u03bb\u02c6,\u221e)\n[1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)]v \u2212 \u03bb U?, (24)\nwhere \u03bb\u02c6 is the queue length at p\u02c6 if (22) holds with equality. This problem is strictly concave. Therefore\nevery buyer will choose the same queue length \u03bb?(U?, U?) dependent on U? (and associated price)\nwhen trading with low types. The dependence on U? only arises because it might affect \u03bb\u02c6. Similarly,\nthe optimization problem for a seller that considers trading with high buyer types is\nmax\n\u03bb\u2208[0,\u03bb\u02c6]\n[1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)]v \u2212 \u03bb U? (25)\nwhich is also strictly concave. Therefore every buyer will choose the same queue length \u03bb?(U?, U?)\ndependent on U? and U? (and associated price) when trading with low types.\nIt is easy to see that it is not optimal to trade at \u03bb\u02c6. For an individual firm, trading at \u03bb\u02c6 is only\noptimal if profits at higher queue length according to (24) are not profitable, i.e. the right derivative\nhas to be \u2212P \u20320(\u03bb\u02c6)v \u2212 U? \u2264 0. By a similar logic the left derivative of (25) has to be positive, i.e.\n\u2212P \u20320(\u03bb\u02c6)v \u2212 U? \u2265 0, which together imply \u2212P \u20320(\u03bb\u02c6) [v \u2212 v] \u2265 U? \u2212 U?. Since \u03bb\u02c6 is the point where both\n(22) and (23) hold, we have U?\u2212U? = [v\u2212v](1\u2212P0(\u03bb\u02c6))\/\u03bb\u02c6. Therefore the prior inequality becomes after\nsome rearranging 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb\u02c6) + \u03bb\u02c6P \u20320(\u03bb\u02c6) \u2264 0, which delivers a contradiction. Therefore no seller caters to\nboth buyer types.\nThis leads to the following result:\nProposition 3 Assume the mechanism space M includes fixed price mechanisms only. A unique\nequilibrium exists with one \u201cmarket\u201d for each buyer type that trades: If the low types trade in equilibrium,\nthen exactly two prices are offered in equilibrium and all low type buyers trade at the low price and all\nhigh type buyers trade at the high price. If only high type sellers trade in equilibrium, only one price is\noffered at which they trade.\nProof. Since \u03bb\u02c6 is never an optimal choice for an individual seller, and neither zero nor infinity can be\noptimal choices, in equilibrium the optimal choice of a firm has to be characterized by the first order\ncondition. For (24) this is\n\u2212P \u20320(\u03bb)v = U?.\nSince all sellers will choose the same queue length, the buyer-seller ratio is \u03bb = b\u03b3s when \u03b3 is the fraction\nof sellers that trade with low types. With slight abuse of notation let \u03bb?(\u03b3) = b\u03b3s . Profits are then\npi(\u03b3) =\n[\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bb?(\u03b3)) + \u03bb?(\u03b3)P \u20320(\u03bb?(\u03b3))\n]\nv. (26)\n18\n\u03bb(p)\npp p\u02c6 p\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\u02c6\n\u03bb\npi\nv\nv\nFigure 1: The Separation of Buyer Types\nSimilar logic for high types implies U? = \u2212P \u20320(\u03bb\n? (1\u2212 \u03b3))v and \u03bb? (1\u2212 \u03b3) = b(1\u2212\u03b3)s and\npi(\u03b3) =\n[\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bb? (1\u2212 \u03b3)) + \u03bb? (1\u2212 \u03b3)P \u20320(\u03bb? (1\u2212 \u03b3))\n]\nv. (27)\nIn equilibrium it cannot be that only the low type buyers trade, as then U? = 0 and it would be optimal\nto trade with the high types. If pi(0) \u2264 pi(0) then even if it is most attractive to trade with low types\nit is not worthwhile and therefore in equilibrium \u03b3? = 0. Otherwise the equilibrium has \u03b3? uniquely\ndetermined by pi(\u03b3?) = pi(\u03b3?). This uniquely characterizes the equilibrium.\nThe separation result is illustrated in Figure 1. Indifference curves satisfy single crossing as derived\nin the proof of Lemma 2. For high valuation buyers v, the IC is everywhere flatter than that of low\nvaluation buyers v. All sellers are identical and in equilibrium they will obtain equal profits catering\nto both types of buyers. Observe that if the price p\u02c6 is offered to both types of buyers, a seller has\nan incentive to deviate by offering either a strictly higher (or strictly lower) price, thereby catering\nexclusively to the high type (low type) buyers. Such a deviation is profitable since the isoprofit curve\nat p\u02c6 (dashed line) is not tangent, and maintaining the same utility level for at least one of the buyers, a\nseller can achieve a position on a strictly higher iso-profit. This continues to be the case as long as the\nisoprofit curve is not tangent to both indifference curves simultaneously. In equilibrium, a seller makes\nequal profits from both types of buyers, and the buyer types have strict preferences over which (p, \u03bb)\npair to choose. High type buyers prefer high prices and low queue lengths, and low type buyers prefer\nlow prices and high queue lengths.\n19\nIt is interesting to note that profit equations (26) and (27) fulfill the Hosios (1990) condition, which\nis important for constrained efficiency in search models, because it gives agents the correct incentives\nto enter one market rather than another. Writing profits as pi = (1\u2212P0)(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03bbP \u20320\/(1\u2212P0)))v shows\nthat conditional on matching the share of the surplus that goes to the seller is equal to one minus the\nelasticity of the matching function (and full-trade ensures that trade takes place whenever at least one\nbuyer is present). The matching function is the probability 1\u2212P0(\u03bb) of being able to trade. The Hosios\ncondition induces constrained efficiency as long as we only consider non-screening mechanism \u2013 but can\nsometimes be too weak a notion to guarantee constrained efficiency when larger classes of mechanisms\nare allowed. This depends on the meeting technology as we discuss in the following sections.\nTo establish such constrained efficiency in the class of non-screening mechanisms formally, we con-\nsider a planner that takes the frictions as given and can only use mechanisms that give the good to one\nof the buyers at random. We will show that even if the planner assigns to each seller i its personalized\nmechanism with queue lengths \u03bbp(i) and \u03bbp(i) of low and high buyer types and even if the planner does\nnot have to consider any incentive constraints, he will not achieve a higher surplus than the decentral-\nized economy. Here i can be viewed as the name of the mechanism of this seller. These functions \u03bbp(i)\nand \u03bbp(i) are feasible if they are measurable and indeed reflect the ratio of buyers to sellers in the sense\nthat \u222b s\n0\n\u03bbp(i)di \u2264 b and\n\u222b s\n0\n\u03bb\np(i)di \u2264 b. (28)\nThe realized surplus is\nS(\u03bbp, \u03bbp) =\n\u222b s\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bbp(i) + \u03bbp(i)\n)][\u03bbp(i)v + \u03bbp(i)v\u00af\n\u03bbp(i) + \u03bbp(i)\n]\ndi, (29)\nwhere the first brackets reflect the probability that the seller has a buyer, in which case his probability\nof selecting a high type is \u03bbp(i)\/(\u03bbp(i)+\u03bbp(i)) and v is realized, and with the complementary probability\nv is realized.\nThe price posting equilibrium in which a fraction \u03b3 caters to the low valuation sellers can be\nrepresented as a planners strategy \u03bbp(i) = \u03bb?(\u03b3) for all i \u2208 [0, \u03b3s] and zero otherwise, and \u03bbp(i) = \u03bb?(\u03b3)\nfor i \u2208 (\u03b3s, s] and zero otherwise. We will show that this \u201dprice posting\u201d assignment is constrained\nefficient in the space of mechanisms that give away the good at random.\nProposition 4 Consider a mechanism space M that includes fixed prices and possibly other mecha-\nnisms, but only includes non-screening mechanisms. Then the equilibrium when sellers can only compete\nin fixed prices is constrained even underM. In particular, the realized surplus in the price posting equi-\nlibrium is higher than under any other feasible queue length functions \u03bb(.) and \u03bb(.).\nProof. Consider some queue length functions \u03bbp(.) and \u03bbp(.). We will first show that it is sufficient to\nconcentrate on queue length functions that assign strictly positive \u03bbp(\u03c3) only if \u03bbp(.) = 0. To see this,\n20\nwrite the surplus as\nS(\u03bbp, \u03bbp) = v\n\u222b s\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(i)\n)]\nf(i)di+ v\n\u222b s\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(i)\n)]\nf(i)di\n= v\n\u222b s\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(i)\n)]\ndF (i) + v\n\u222b s\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(i)\n)]\ndF (i)\nwhere \u03bb\u02c7(i) = \u03bbp(i) +\u03bbp(i), f(i) = \u03bb\np(i)\n\u03bbp(i)+\u03bb\np\n(i))\nand F (i) =\n\u222b s\n0 f(i)di, likewise for f, F . The first term can\nbe interpreted as assigning all low valuation buyers to a measure F (s) of firms and all high valuation\nbuyers to a measure F (s) if firms match according to the assignment function \u03bb\u02c7(i). Another way of\nseeing this is to rewrite the expression as\nS(\u03bbp, \u03bbp) = v\n\u222b F (s)\n0\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(F (x))\n)]\ndx+ v\n\u222b s\nF (s)\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\n\u03bb\u02c7(F (x\u2212 F (s))))] dx\nwhich is identical to a feasible assignment function that assigns queue length \u03bb(i) = \u03bb\u02c7(F (i)) to all firms\nin [0, F (s)] and \u03bb(i) = 0 otherwise, and \u03bb(i) = \u03bb\u02c7(F (i \u2212 F (s))) to all firms in [F (s), s] and \u03bb(i) = 0\notherwise.\nNext, observe that 1 \u2212 P0 (\u03bb) is strictly concave, and therefore it is optimal to assign an identical\nqueue length \u03bb to all firms that sell to low valuation buyers and an identical queue length \u03bb to all\nfirms that sell to high valuation buyers. If a fraction \u03b1 of the firms sell to low valuation buyers, those\nachieve a buyer seller ratio of b\/(\u03b1s). This ratio depends on \u03b1, and we will denote it with slight abuse of\nnotation by \u03bb(\u03b1) = b\/(\u03b1s). For the fraction (1\u2212\u03b1) of firms that sell to the high types, the buyer-seller\nratio is b\/(1 \u2212 \u03b1). Again, with slight abuse of notation we denote this as \u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03b1) = b\/(1 \u2212 \u03b1). The\nmaximization problem of the planner reduces to\nmax\n\u03b1\u2208[0,1]\n\u03b1(1\u2212 P0(\u03bb(\u03b1)))v + (1\u2212 \u03b1)(1\u2212 P0(\u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b1)))v.\nThe planner clearly chooses \u03b1 < 1. If he chooses to trade with low valuation buyers, the first order\ncondition for optimality is\n(1\u2212 P0(\u03bb(\u03b1)) + \u03bb(\u03b1)P \u20320(\u03bb(\u03b1)))v = (1\u2212 P0(\u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b1)) + \u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b1)P \u20320(\u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b1)))v, (30)\nwhere we used the fact that (\u2202\u03bb(\u03b1)\/\u2202\u03b1) = \u2212\u03bb(\u03b1)\/\u03b1 and (\u2202\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)\/\u2202\u03b1) = \u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)\/(1\u2212\u03b1). Note that\nthis is identical to the condition that profits according to (26) and (27) have to be equal. Moreover,\nit is easy to show that \u03b1 = 0 if the left hand side of (30) evaluated as \u03b1 = 0 is smaller then the right\nhand side of (30) evaluated at \u03b1 = 0, which again coincides with the equilibrium.\nIn the following, we will extend the mechanisms spaceM to allow for ex-post screening mechanisms\nsuch as auctions. This changes the available mechanisms for the sellers and, thus, possibly the nature\nof the equilibrium. It also relaxes the constraints on the planner, and higher surplus might be possible.\nIn particular we investigate under which meeting technologies the extended mechanism space actually\nchanges equilibria and constrained efficiency, and under which it does not.\n21\n5 Competition in Mechanisms\n5.1 Purely non-rival meetings\nHere we consider meeting technologies in which a seller can meet multiple buyers simultaneously. More\nspecifically, meetings are purely non-rival in the sense that the meeting probability for a buyer is not\naffected by the presence of other buyers in the market: the probability 1 \u2212 Q0(\u03bb) of a meeting is\nindependent of \u03bb. This means in particular that an increase in the number of low types in a market\ndoes not diminish the chances for high types of meeting a seller. It might diminish their trading\nprobability e.g., in the case when prices are used and a seller tries to attract both types of buyers. Yet\nin terms of simply meeting one of the sellers there are no spillovers. This is for example true under\nurn-ball meetings where buyers choose one seller in their desired market at random. In that case the\nprobability of not meeting any seller is zero. The probability of trading will change when there are\nmore buyers because it is harder to obtain the good, but the probability of meeting is constant. The\nurnball meeting technology is the standard assumption of the competing mechanism design literature\n(Peters (1997, 1999)). The set of non-rival meeting functions is substantially larger than the urn-ball\nmeeting function, though.18\nUnder the non-rival meetings assumption we will prove that an equilibrium in which all sellers use\nsecond price auctions with a reserve below v and buyers use random visit strategies yields strictly higher\nsurplus than the equilibrium when sellers were restricted to use prices only. With slight modification it\ncan be shown that any class of mechanisms that does not allow for ex-post screening will not be con-\nstrained efficient. The result obtains even though we have seen that sellers can perfectly screen between\nbuyers by using prices, and therefore no seller in a price posting environment has any uncertainty about\nthe type of buyer he is facing. Note that under purely non-rival meetings, the probability of having a\nmatch with n other high type depends only on \u03bb and is Qn(\u03bb).\nProposition 5 Consider non-rival meetings. The equilibrium in a price posting environment, i.e., an\nenvironment where M only includes fixed price mechanisms, is not constrained efficient under mecha-\nnism setM\u2032 that also includes second price auctions: UnderM\u2032 all sellers posting second price auctions\nwith reserve below v and buyers using random visit strategies is constrained efficient.\nProof. We compare the outcome of the equilibrium where sellers could only use fixed prices to the\noutcome when all sellers post second price auctions with reserve price below v and buyers use random\nvisit strategies. Consider the case when both buyer types can trade in a price posting environment. The\nproof has two steps. First, we prove that there are strictly more trades in the auction environment.\nSecond, we prove that high valuation buyers have strictly more trades. Together this establishes that\nthe auction environment is more efficient.\n18We do not have a full characterization for this rather large set of meeting technologies. Even starting from the urn-ball\nmeeting function, lots of other meeting functions can be constructed that are non-rival and differ substantially from urn-\nball. For example, all buyers in one-buyer matches can be coordinated into pairs, which increases the number of two-buyer\nmatches and decreases the number of one-buyer matches: Let QU be the urn-ball meeting technology. Then Q0 = Q\nU\n0 ,\nQ1 = 0, Q2 = Q\nU\n2 + Q\nU\n1 \/2 and Qn = Q\nU\nn for n > 2 is also a non-rival meeting technologies. Along this line, many other\ntransformations are possible.\n22\nFor the first part of the argument, observe that in a price posting environment some fraction \u03b1 of\nsellers has a low queue length \u03bb = b\/\u03b1s while a fraction 1\u2212 \u03b1 has a high queue length \u03bb = b\/(1\u2212 \u03b1)s.\nThe total number of trades in a price posting economy is\nT (\u03b1) = \u03b1s\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\nb\n\u03b1s\n)]\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b1)s\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\nb\n(1\u2212 \u03b1) s\n)]\nThe first order condition for the optimal number of trades is[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\nb\n\u03b1s\n)]\n+\nb\n\u03b1s\nP \u20320\n(\nb\n\u03b1s\n)\n\u2212\n[\n1\u2212 P0\n(\nb\n(1\u2212 \u03b1) s\n)]\n\u2212 b\n(1\u2212 \u03b1) sP\n\u2032\n0\n(\nb\n(1\u2212 \u03b1) s\n)\n= 0,\nwhich is, under P0 convex, only satisfied if b\/\u03b1s = b\/(1\u2212\u03b1)s, i.e., when agents\u2019 visiting probabilities are\nthe same at all firms. This is not achieved in a price posting environment which induces non-random\nvisit strategies. Since T \u2032\u2032(\u03b1) < 0 at all \u03b1, the first order condition indeed characterizes the optimal\nnumber of trades. The random visit strategies of the auction environment indeed yield the highest\nnumber of trades.\nFor the second part of the argument, we show that the high valuation buyers have strictly more\ntrades under random visit strategies with auctions than in a price posting environment. Under auctions,\nthe queue length for high buyer types is \u03bba = bs . The trading probability is\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nQn(\u03bb\na)\n1\nn\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn(\u03bb\na)\n\u03bb\na =\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bba)\n\u03bb\na .\nSimilarly, under price posting only a fraction (1\u2212\u03b1) of firms attract high types which induces a queue\nof \u03bbp = b\/[(1\u2212\u03b1)s]. A high buyer\u2019s trading probability is then by a similar logic (1\u2212P0(\u03bbp))\/\u03bbp. Since\nP0 is convex we have the trading probability increasing in \u03bb, and since \u03bb\na\n> \u03bb\np the high types can trade\nmore often in the auction environment and therefore more often the high valuation surplus is realized.\nFinally, consider the case when only the high valuation buyers can trade in a price posting equi-\nlibrium. They do not trade more often than in the auction environment, as we have shown that the\nauction environment maximizes the number of trades for high types. In fact, it achieves an identical\namounts of trade for high types compared to price posting where only high types trade. Moreover,\nthe auction environment allows some low types to trade when no high type is present, which strictly\nraises the surplus. Constrained efficiency of the auction environment follows trivially from the fact\nthat auctions maximize the overall number of trades as well as the number of trades for high valuation\nbuyers.\nObserve that any mechanism that does not screen buyers ex post will generate less surplus than\nan equilibrium in second price auctions. We know from McAfee (1993) and Peters (1997) that an\nequilibrium in second price auctions exists under urn-ball meetings, and their approach can be extended\nto our setting by generalizing the meeting technology. They do not prove uniqueness. Here we show\nthat there does not exist another equilibrium in which all sellers post fixed prices (or a mechanism\nwithout ex post screening) when a larger set of ex-post screening mechanisms is allowed. The reason is\n23\nthat a seller can offer buyers the same payoff as under price posting, while enjoying exactly the efficiency\ngains that an auction environment implements.\nProposition 6 Consider non-rival meetings. If all sellers post prices, it is strictly profitable for a\ndeviating seller to post a second price auction coupled with a show-up fee.\nProof. The the equilibrium when sellers can only compete in prices delivers some utility U? and U? for\nthe low and high type buyers, as well as some profit pi? for the sellers. Now consider a seller who posts\na second price auction with show-up fee \u2212f and reserve r. The reserve r is due only when a single buyer\nis present, and we assume that buyers commit to paying this reserve when they are the only buyers,\neven if r > v. With such a mechanism, the seller obtains a payoff pif,rn,n = r \u2212 f when there is one low\nor high buyer, obtains pif,rn,n = v \u2212 (n + n)f when n = 1, n \u2265 1, or when n \u2265 2 and n = 0; and obtains\npif,rn,n = v + (n + n)f when n \u2265 2. In all other cases his payoff is zero. The seller solves the following\nprogram\nmax\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+,(f,r)\u2208R2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)pi\nf,r\nn,n (31)\nsuch that\n(1\u2212Q0(\u03bb+ \u03bb))f + Q\u02dc0,0(\u03bb, \u03bb) [v \u2212 r] \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (32)\n(1\u2212Q0(\u03bb+ \u03bb))f + Q\u02dc0,0(\u03bb, \u03bb) [v \u2212 r] +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) [v \u2212 v] \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0. (33)\nwhere the first constrained arises because the low type buyers obtain the good only when they are\nalone. The second constraint arises because high types only make positive profits when there are no\nother high types in the auctions, in which case they either pay the bid of the low type buyer if one\nis present, or they pay the reserve price. Incentive compatibility is trivially fulfilled for second price\nauctions.\nClearly the seller can implement the average queue length \u03bb = b\/s and \u03bb = b\/s with some com-\nbination of his instruments f and r. Now assume all sellers would use such an auction. Then the\naverage queue length would be implemented at all sellers, which is feasible. We know from Proposition\n5 that the surplus in this environment is higher than under price posting. But we have constructed the\nenvironment in such a way that the buyers obtain exactly the same utility as in the price posting envi-\nronment, which means that the sellers must get higher profits. This in turn means that our deviating\nseller enjoys strictly higher profits than those sellers who do not screen buyers ex post.\n5.2 Purely rival meetings\nHere we assume that meetings are purely rival. Pure rivalry can be captured by the condition \u03bb(1 \u2212\nQ0(\u03bb)) = 1 \u2212 P0(\u03bb). For a unit measure of sellers, the right hand side gives the number of them that\nmeet at least one buyer. The left hand side gives the number of buyers in the market that meet at\nleast one seller. Taking the total derivative with respect to \u03bb and rearranging reveals the following:\n24\nWhen more buyers enter the market, the meetings for existing buyers change by \u03bbQ\u20320(\u03bb), which equals\nthe change in overall meetings P \u20320(\u03bb) minus the meetings (1\u2212Q0(\u03bb)) for new buyers. Every new buyer\ntherefore takes one-for-one away from the meeting prospects for existing buyers.\nIt is easy to see from (1) that this happens if and only if meetings are bilateral. That is, Pn(\u03bb) = 0\nfor all n > 1. This immediately implies that only Q0(\u03bb) and Q1(\u03bb) can be strictly positive. In this case\nwe have\n1\u2212Q0(\u03bb) = Q1(\u03bb) = P1(\u03bb)\n\u03bb\n=\n1\u2212 P0(\u03bb)\n\u03bb\n.\nSince P \u20320(\u03bb) < 0 we cannot have Q\u20320(\u03bb) = 0 , and therefore the meeting probability of say high types\nchanges when more low types enter the market. This is unavoidable in models with bilateral meetings.\nIt constitutes the main externality in this setting.\nWe want to show that price posting is optimal for the sellers, i.e., no other mechanism performs\nbetter, and it is an equilibrium. Other mechanisms could still elicit buyers\u2019 types via wasteful destruc-\ntion, yet the key insight with purely rival meetings is that ex-ante separation of types achieves type\nrevelation without wasteful destruction.\nProposition 7 Under purely rival meetings, price posting is always a best response by a seller.\nProof. A seller now solves the program\nmax\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+, m\u2208M\nP1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n[\n\u03bbpim1,0 + \u03bbpi\nm\n0,1\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\n]\n(34)\n= max\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+, m\u2208M\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n[\n\u03bbpim1,0 + \u03bbpi\nm\n0,1\n]\nsuch that\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um1,0 \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (35)\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um0,1 \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0, (36)\nand the incentive compatibility constraints for truthful type revelation have to hold:\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um1,0 \u2265 Q1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n[\num0,1 \u2212 xm0,1(v \u2212 v)\n]\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n[\num1,0 + x\nm\n1,0(v \u2212 v)\n] \u2264 Q1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um0,1\nas well as the resource constraints pim1,0 +u\nm\n1,0 \u2264 xm0,1v and pim0,1 +um0,1 \u2264 xm0,1v. The incentive compatibility\nconditions can be rewritten as\nxm0,1 \u2265\num0,1 \u2212 um1,0\nv \u2212 v \u2265 x\nm\n0,1\nOptimality clearly has xm0,1 = 1. Thus, any difference \u2206u = u\nm\n0,1 \u2212 um1,0 < v \u2212 v involves no trade with\nlow types with probability \u2206uv\u2212v . Therefore,\n\u03bb[pim1,0+um1,0]+\u03bb[pim0,1+um0,1]\n\u03bb+\u03bb\n\u2264 \u03bb\u2206uv+\u03bb v\n\u03bb+\u03bb\n, it is easy to see that it\n25\nis optimal to have this hold with equality. This reduces the problem to\nmax\n(\u03bb,\u03bb)\u2208R2+, m\u2208M\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)\n[\n\u03bb\num0,1 \u2212 um1,0\nv \u2212 v\n(\nv \u2212 um1,0\n)\n+ \u03bb\n(\nv \u2212 um0,1\n)]\nsuch that\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um1,0 \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0,\nQ1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)um0,1 \u2264 U?, with equality if \u03bb > 0,\n0 \u2264 um0,1 \u2212 um1,0 \u2264 v \u2212 v.\nAssume the optimal program has some contract m and \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb > 0. If \u03bb\num0,1\u2212um1,0\nv\u2212v\n(\nv \u2212 um1,0\n) \u2264\n\u03bb\n(\nv \u2212 um0,1\n)\nthen there exists an optimal contract m\u2032 and \u03bb\u2032 > 0 and \u03bb\u2032 = 0. The reason is that at least\nthe same payoff can be obtained by choosing \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb + \u03bb and um\u20320,1 = um0,1 and um0,1 \u2212 um\n\u2032\n1,0 = v \u2212 v. Yet\nthis can be achieved with a price posting contract where the posted price p is such that um0,1 = v \u2212 p.\nIf \u03bb\num0,1\u2212um1,0\nv\u2212v\n(\nv \u2212 um1,0\n)\n> \u03bb\n(\nv \u2212 um0,1\n)\nthen there exists an optimal contract m\u2032 and \u03bb\u2032 = 0 and \u03bb\u2032 > 0.\nThe reason is again that at least the same payoff can be obtained by choosing \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb+\u03bb and um\u20320,1 = um0,1\nand um\n\u2032\n0,1\u2212um\n\u2032\n1,0 = v\u2212 v. This again can be achieved with a price posting contract with a price such that\num0,1 = v \u2212 p.\nGiven that an equilibrium exists when sellers can only use price posting strategies, and given that\nno other mechanism achieves higher profits, we have\nCorollary 4 Under purely rival meetings, an equilibrium exists if the set of mechanisms M includes\nall price posting mechanisms. One equilibrium is identical to the price posting equilibrium of Section 4.\nOur final result concerns the constrained efficiency of the equilibrium. Again, constrained efficiency\ninvolves finding functions \u03bbp(\u03c3) and \u03bbp(\u03c3) such that (28) is fulfilled. We could additionally specify\nfunctions that destroy some of the surplus in order to induce truthful type revelation, but it is clear\nthat a social planner would always want the seller to trade once a buyer shows up. The realized surplus\nthat is to be maximized is then\nS(\u03bbp, \u03bbp) =\n\u222b s\n0\n[P1,0(\u03bbp(\u03c3) + \u03bb\np(\u03c3))v + P0,1(\u03bbp(\u03c3) + \u03bb\np(\u03c3))v]d\u03c3. (37)\nProposition 8 The price posting equilibrium is constrained efficient.\nProof. Since P1,0(\u03bb, \u03bb) = P1(\u03bb+\u03bb)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb+\u03bb\nand P0,1(\u03bb, \u03bb) = P1(\u03bb+\u03bb) \u03bb\u03bb+\u03bb and under purely rival meetings\nP1(\u03bb+ \u03bb) = 1\u2212 P0(\u03bb+ \u03bb) the surplus (37) is identical to the surplus specified in (29) in Section 4, for\nwhich we have shown that the queue length that arise under price posting are optimal.\n26\n5.3 Partially rival meetings\nFor a synthesis that clearly highlights the constrained efficiency considerations that drive the choice of\nmechanisms, consider the intermediate case where meetings are partially rival. That means that neither\n1\u2212Q0(\u03bb) is constant as in the purely non-rival case, nor \u03bb(1\u2212Q0(\u03bb))\u2212 1 +P0(\u03bb) is constant as in the\npurely rival case. Even though the literature including much of our present paper has focussed on the\nextreme cases, such intermediate cases constitute an important avenue for future research.\nPartially rival meeting functions are particularly important in our context because they show that\nthe dominance of price posting is not an artifact of bilateral meetings, where price posting is optimal\neven in a non-competitive setting (Riley and Zeckhauser (1983)). Rather, it is directly linked to the\nnegative externality of low types on high types before they meet a seller. Partially rival meetings imply\nthat at least some of the meetings are multilateral (since purely rival is equivalent to bilateral meetings).\nTherefore, in any partially rival meeting process buyers can use auctions at least for those meetings in\nwhich multiple buyers are present. And a monopolist seller who is allocated exogenously some random\nnumber of buyers would optimally use auctions to screen between buyers whenever multiple buyers are\npresent. Here we show that with competing sellers, it is efficient to separate buyer types into separate\nmarkets when rivalry is strong, and in this case the equilibrium also features separation of types and\nprices constitute an equilibrium mechanism.\nTo state our results, it will be useful to introduce some notation first. Let the full information\nsurplus of a market with unit measure of buyers, \u03bb low buyers and \u03bb high buyers be\nSF (\u03bb, \u03bb) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)v +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPn,0(\u03bb, \u03bb)v. (38)\nThis is the surplus when every seller who has at least one high type sells the good to a high type, and\nevery seller who has only low types sells the good to one of the low types. It is the highest surplus\nthat can be achieved in this market. Now consider the surplus if a fraction \u03b1 of the sellers attract all\nthe low type buyers to some market and sell whenever they have at least one buyer, and the remaining\nfraction 1 \u2212 \u03b1 of sellers attract all the high type buyers to some other market and sell whenever they\nhave at least one buyer. In this case the total surplus is\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\u00af\/(1\u2212 \u03b1)) + \u03b1SF (\u03bb\/\u03b1, 0). (39)\nWe will consider the case where for any \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb > 0 there exists \u03b1 such that (39) is strictly\nlarger than (38), so that it is efficient to separate markets. In this case we show that price posting\nalways constitutes an equilibrium. This condition is demanding because it requires an ordering of (38)\nand (39) for all \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb > 0. A less demanding condition is needed to rule out a price posting\nequilibrium. Consider the overall buyer-seller ratios in the market \u03bb = b and \u03bb = b, and the optimal\nfraction \u03b1p of firms that cater to the low types is characterized in (30). If for these values (38) is larger\nthan (39), than it is efficient to join markets and screen ex-post, and price posting cannot be part of any\nequilibrium. Before stating and proving this result formally, it might be instructive to discuss which\n27\ntype of meeting functions obtain such an ordering of (38) and (39).\nConsider a meeting technology P for sellers that is a convex combination of a purely rival meeting\ntechnology PR and a purely non-rival meeting technology PN , i.e.,19\nP = (1\u2212 \u03b3)PR + \u03b3PN . (40)\nThis is a permissible meeting technology since consistency (1), stochastic dominance (2) and convexity\n(3) are preserved. Now fix some \u03bb and \u03bb. In the previous analysis, subsection 5.1 considered the extreme\ncase where \u03b3 = 1 and we showed that (38) is larger than (39), while subsection 5.2 analyzed the extreme\ncase of \u03b3 = 0 and we showed that (38) is smaller than (39). By continuity, (38) is larger than (39)\nif the most of the weight is on PN and (39) is larger than (38) if most weight is on PR. To rule out\nprice posting, we have to show that a deviant can generate higher profits. For some specifications of\nthe rival and non-rival meeting technology, \u03b1P as characterized in (30) does not depend on \u03b3, and since\n\u03bb = b and \u03bb = b do not depend on \u03b3 either it is obvious that (38) is larger than (39) for \u03b3 sufficiently\nlarge.20 To sustain price posting, we have to ensure that a deviant does not obtain higher profits. The\ndeviant might attract very different buyer-seller ratios, and therefore we require efficiency of separation\nfor all possible combinations of high and low types in a market. In the appendix we discuss that there\nindeed exist PR and PN and \u03b3 > 0 such that (38) uniformly dominates (39). Therefore, if meetings\nare predominantly governed by a rival meeting function, price posting constitutes an equilibrium even\nthough sellers can commit to auctions when meetings are multilateral.\nThe following shows formally that the nature of the efficiency ordering between (38) and (39)\ncrucially affects the types of mechanisms used in equilibrium. For the second part of the proposition,\nrecall that \u03b1p is the fraction of firms that cater to low types when only fixed price mechanisms are\navailable.\nProposition 9 If the meeting technology is such that for all \u03bb\u00af > 0 and \u03bb > 0 there exists an \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]\nand\nSF (\u03bb, \u03bb\u00af) < \u03b1SF (\u03bb\/\u03b1, 0) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\u00af\/(1\u2212 \u03b1)), (41)\nthen there exists an equilibrium in which all sellers post prices.\nIf the meeting technology is such that\nSF (b, b) > \u03b1pSF (b\/\u03b1p, 0) + (1\u2212 \u03b1p)SF (0, b\/(1\u2212 \u03b1p)), (42)\n19A more structural reason for hybrid meeting technologies is the following. Consider buyers who can send one letter to\none of the buyers indicating that they want to trade (i.e., think of workers that have time to fill out one job application).\nBut assume that sellers only have time to open and read up to N envelopes. The case N = 1 amounts to bilateral meetings:\nThe seller can only see one buyer and cannot screen between any applicants any longer. With N \u2192 \u221e we are in the\nstandard urn-ball meeting environment with purely non-rival (multilateral) meetings, and sellers have full control whom\nto give the object to by choosing the appropriate auction format. To the extent that one can make N divisible, e.g., by\ninterpreting N = 1.5 as a 50%-50% chance that the seller has time to open one or two envelopes, then N \u2192 1 has the\nsame effect as \u03b3 \u2192 0 in the following.\n20Note also that (39) dominates (38) for given partially rival meeting technology and given v1 if v2 is sufficiently large,\nsince the rival nature in the meeting function will make it too costly to put both types in the same market.\n28\nthen there exists no equilibrium in which all sellers post prices if the mechanisms space is rich enough\n(e.g., includes second price auctions with reserve and participation fee).\nProof. For the first part, assume (41) holds. Consider a candidate equilibrium. We will show that no\nmatter what mechanism m an individual seller considers to post, he can make weakly higher profits by\nposting a price. This establishes the result.\nConsider any mechanism m. It has to satisfy resource constraint (10). This constraint is most\nrelaxed if the good is always given to the high type when possible, i.e. xmn,n = 1 if n > 0 and zero\notherwise, and xmn,n = 1 if n = 0 but n > 0 and zero otherwise. In this case constraint (10) reduces to\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)[pimn,n + n u\nm\nn,n + n u\nm\nn,n] \u2264 SF (\u03bb, \u03bb) (43)\nDefine the expected profit using this mechanism as \u03a0 =\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn Pn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)pi\nm\nn,n. Further, note that in any\noptimal mechanism (if it attracts the low type) the participating constraint (19) binds\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn Q\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)u\nm\nn+1,n =\nU. Similar for high types. Using the relationship between P and Q in (1) and the other properties on\nthe meeting technology, we show in the appendix that (43) can equivalently be written as\n\u03a0 + \u03bb U + \u03bb U \u2264 SF (\u03bb, \u03bb). (44)\nThis has the clear-cut interpretation that the expected profit for the seller plus the expected number\nof low types times their individual expected utility plus the expected number of high types times their\nindividual expected utility has to be less than the expected surplus generated by an individual seller.\nSince we started with the premise that (41) holds with strict inequality if both \u03bb and \u03bb are strictly\npositive, we have\n\u03a0 + \u03bb U + \u03bb U < \u03b1SF (\n\u03bb\n\u03b1\n, 0) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\n1\u2212 \u03b1), (45)\nif both \u03bb and \u03bb are strictly positive, and by continuity it holds with a weak inequality otherwise.\nNow consider an individual seller who contemplates to post a price. He considers price p such that\nparticipation constraint (19) for the low types is exactly met at buyer-seller-ratio \u03bb\/\u03b1. Therefore, his\nprofit is at least \u03a0(p) = (1 \u2212 P0(\u03bb\/\u03b1))p.21 Since there is always trade if at least one buyer shows up,\nall the rest of the surplus goes to the buyers and it is easy to show that SF (\u03bb\u03b1 , 0) = \u03a0(p) +\n\u03bb\n\u03b1U.\nAlternatively, he can contemplate posting a high price p such that participation constraint (20)\nfor the high types is exactly met at buyer-seller-ratio \u03bb\/(1 \u2212 \u03b1). He makes at least profit \u03a0(p) =\n(1 \u2212 P0( \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1))p. Again the rest of the surplus goes to the buyers and SF (0, \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1) = \u03a0(p) + \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1U.\n21Participation constraint (19) is binding if (1\u2212Q0(\u03bb\/\u03b1))(v\u2212 p) = U. By (16) this will indeed be the queue length that\nthis seller attracts if (1 \u2212 Q0(\u03bb\/\u03b1))(v\u00af \u2212 p) \u2264 U, since in this case he does not attract any high types. He could attract\neven more buyers if (1 \u2212 Q0(\u03bb\/\u03b1))(v\u00af \u2212 p) > U, because then the buyer-seller ratio is determined by indifference of the\nhigh types according to (17), and a higher buyer-seller ratio at the same price means even higher profits.\n29\nTherefore, we can write (45) as\n\u03a0 + \u03bb U + \u03bb U < \u03b1[\u03a0(p) + (\u03bb\/\u03b1)U ] + (1\u2212 \u03b1)[\u03a0(p) + (\u03bb\/(1\u2212 \u03b1))U ]\n\u21d4 \u03a0 < \u03b1\u03a0(p) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03a0(p)\n\u21d2 \u03a0 < max{\u03a0(p),\u03a0(p)}.\nwhere the inequality is weak if either \u03bb or \u03bb is zero. Therefore, price posting is always at least as\nprofitable as posting any other mechanism. Thus, equilibrium in which sellers compete only in prices\nremains an equilibrium even if other mechanisms are available. Moreover, posting the optimal price is\nstrictly more profitable than any mechanism that attracts both buyer types with positive probability.\nTherefore, any equilibrium has strict separation of types in different markets.\nThe second part of the proof is essentially a reversal of the above arguments. The logic of Proposition\n6 applies, and the price posting equilibrium cannot survive.\nThis highlights that price posting is not an artifact of purely rival meetings. Rather, it arises from\nthe interaction of buyers in the search process. If the externalities in the search process are strong in the\nsense that bad types induce an externality such that good types find it difficult to reach the mechanism,\nsellers do not find it optimal to attract both types of buyers even if they could screen them apart in\nthe event that multiple buyers reach the mechanism. Such externalities arise, e.g., when the seller is\ntime constrained and cannot interact with all potential buyers (see also Footnote 19). The analysis of\ncompetition in mechanisms therefore crucially relies on the properties of the underlying meeting process\nthat hitherto has not been considered in the literature.\n6 Conclusion\nPosted prices are prevalent in many economic environments, yet theory from the literature on search\nand competing mechanism design tells us that auctions generate higher surplus. In this paper we have\nshown that the characteristics of the meeting technology are crucially important for which equilibrium\nsales mechanism is used. When meetings are rival, low buyer types significantly affect the prospects\nof the high types obtaining the good and ex post screening as in auctions is very costly. Instead,\nunder price posting different buyer types adequately sort ex ante, ensuring that high types trade with\nsufficiently high probability.\nIn order to rationalize the prevailing equilibrium mechanism observed in markets, we offer this as\na novel explanation. Much of the mechanism design literature focuses on the role of variations in the\nmechanism space. For example, can competing sellers condition their mechanism on the mechanism of\nother sellers (see Epstein and Peters (1999))? As an alternative, our results show that the characteristics\nof the search frictions can explain the nature of the observed equilibrium trade mechanism. Because of\nfrictions, valuable information is obtained from ex ante selection even before the mechanism is called\nto act. Such selection is an integral feature of competition.\nWe finish by pointing out a parallel in our findings to standard price theory. In general equilibrium,\n30\nwhen goods are rival the price mechanism works well in the allocation process, while other mechanisms\nare required when goods are non-rival. In our setting, goods are purely rival, but the meeting technology\nmay not be. When meetings are rival, prices allocate resources well. In contrast, when meetings are\nnon-rival, other mechanisms outperform the price mechanism.\n31\nAppendix\nElaboration on rival and non-rival meeting technologies PR and PN in (40):\nAs a special case of a purely non-rival meeting technology, consider the urn-ball technology with\nPNn (\u03bb) =\ne\u2212\u03bb\u03bbn\nn! . We can transform this into a purely rival meeting technology by assuming that when-\never several buyers are present, only one is selected at random to enter the mechanism and the others\nare excluded. This yields the purely rival meeting technology PR such that PR0 (\u03bb) = P\nN\n0 (\u03bb) = e\n\u2212\u03bb,\nPR1 (\u03bb) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 P\nN\nn (\u03bb) = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb, and PRn (\u03bb) = 0 for n > 0.\nNow consider the convex combination P = \u03b3PR + (1 \u2212 \u03b3)PN . For this meeting technology, it is\nclear that the surplus from having buyers in separated markets: \u03b1SF (\u03bb\/\u03b1, 0)+(1\u2212\u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\/(1\u2212\u03b1)),\nis independent of \u03b3 for all \u03bb, \u03bb and \u03b1. This is apparent because in separate markets it does not matter\nwhich buyer is selected by the mechanisms because in each market buyers are homogenous. Therefore,\nwhether the mechanism selects the buyer as in PN or one buyer is chosen at random as under PR does\nnot affect efficiency. The full information efficiency when having both types search in the same market\ndoes change with \u03b3, though. When \u03b3 is low, then the meeting function randomly selects a buyer and\na low type might be chosen instead of a high type, and separation would be preferable (Proposition\n8). When \u03b3 is high than most buyers enter some mechanism and the higher type is chosen when both\ntypes are present, and pooling is preferable (Proposition 5). Applying the logic of Proposition (6) rules\nout the existence of a price posting equilibrium in the latter case.\nShowing that a price posting equilibrium does exist requires by the first part of Proposition (9) that\nthe surplus from separating surpasses the surplus from pooling for all combinations of buyer-seller ratios\nof the two types. We will briefly discuss that there indeed exists a \u03b3 > 0 such that P = \u03b3PN +(1\u2212\u03b3)PR\nhas this property. Consider first the surplus from separation. We have\n\u03b1SF (\n\u03bb\n\u03b1\n, 0) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\n1\u2212 \u03b1) = \u03b1(1\u2212 e\n\u2212 \u03bb\n\u03b1 )v + (1\u2212 \u03b1)(1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1 )v.\nThe optimal \u03b1P is \u03b1P = 0 if v1 \u2212 (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb2e\u2212\u03bb2)v2 < 0. Otherwise it is uniquely characterized by\nthe first order condition\n(1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03bb1\u03b1p \u2212 \u03bb1\n\u03b1p\ne\u2212\n\u03bb1\n\u03b1 )v1 \u2212 (1\u2212 e\u2212\n\u03bb\n1\u2212\u03b1p \u2212 \u03bb\n1\u2212 \u03b1p e\n\u2212 \u03bb\n1\u2212\u03b1p )v = 0,\nwhich corresponds to (30) in the main text. The surplus at the optimal \u03b1P is a function of \u03bb and \u03bb, but\nis not affected by \u03b3. Now the difference between the pooling and the separating surplus can be written\n32\nas\n\u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03b3) = SF (\u03bb, \u03bb)\u2212 \u03b1pSF ( \u03bb\n\u03b1p\n, 0)\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)SF (0, \u03bb\n1\u2212 \u03b1p ) (46)\n= \u03b3(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb)v + \u03b3e\u2212\u03bb(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb)v (47)\n+(1\u2212 \u03b3)(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\u2212\u03bb)\n(\n\u03bb\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\nv +\n\u03bb\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\nv\n)\n(48)\n\u2212\u03b1P (1\u2212 e\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u03b1P )v \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1P )(1\u2212 e\u2212\n\u03bb\n1\u2212\u03b1P )v, (49)\nwhere lines (47) and (48) give the surplus under pooling: (47) is the surplus under non-rival meetings\nwhen the good is given to the high type whenever at least one high type is present and to the low type\nonly if no high type is present, while (48) represents the surplus under the rival part of the meeting\nfunction whenever one buyer is selected at random when at least one buyer is present. For given \u03bb > 0\nand \u03bb > 0, \u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, 0) < 0 by Proposition (8), while \u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, 1) > 0 by Proposition (5). By continuity\nthere exists \u03b3(\u03bb, \u03bb) > 0 such that \u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03b3(\u03bb, \u03bb)) = 0.\nCondition (41) has to hold for all \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb > 0, which is equivalent to requiring that \u03b3(\u03bb, \u03bb)\nremains bounded away from zero for all \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb > 0. This is not obvious since \u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, 1) converges\nto zero when either \u03bb or \u03bb converges to zero. The reason is that in the presence of (essentially) only\na single type the gain from pooling over separation is rather low. But to the same extent \u2206(\u03bb, \u03bb, 0)\nconverges to zero because the gain from sorting in different markets rather than taking a random buyer\nis also rather low. Both together mean that increasing \u03b3 yields only moderate benefits in (47) but also\ninduces only moderate costs in (48) relative to the constant surplus from separation in (49). While (46)\nremains analytically intractable, to assess whether \u03b3(\u03bb, \u03bb) remains bounded away from zero we have\nevaluated \u03b3(\u03bb, \u03bb) on a (logarithmic) grid for (\u03bb, \u03bb). The grid spans values for (\u03bb, \u03bb) from (0.0001, 0.0001)\nup to (1000, 1000). The value of \u03b3 is smallest when both queue length are small. Varying the values of\n(\u03bb, \u03bb) by a factor of 100 [going from (0.01, 0.01) to (0.001, 0.001) to (0.0001, 0.0001)] changes the value\nof \u03b3 by only less than half a percent [from 0.17215 to 0.17163 to 0.17158], suggesting that \u03b3 is bounded\naway from zero.\nDerivation of inequality (44) from (43):\nIn the following derivation we repeatedly use (1), Q\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) = Qn+n+1(\u03bb + \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb), and the\nfact that Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\nn\nn+n\n\u03bb+\u03bb\n\u03bb = Bn\u22121,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) and Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\nn\nn+n\n\u03bb+\u03bb\n\u03bb\n= Bn,n\u22121(\u03bb, \u03bb) :\n33\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nn+n>0\nPn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\nn umn,n + n u\nm\nn,n\n]\n=\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nn+n>0\nPn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n[\nn umn,n + n u\nm\nn,n\n]\n=\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nn+n>0\nQn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\nn+ n\n[\nn umn,n + n u\nm\nn,n\n]\n= \u03bb\n\u2211\nn>0\n\u2211\nn\nQn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\nn\nn+ n\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\n\u03bb\numn,n + \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn>0\nQn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb)\nn\nn+ n\n\u03bb+ \u03bb\n\u03bb\numn,n\n= \u03bb\n\u2211\nn>0\n\u2211\nn\nQn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn\u22121,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn,n + \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn>0\nQn+n(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n\u22121(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn,n\n= \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\nQn+n+1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn+1,n + \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\nQn+n+1(\u03bb+ \u03bb)Bn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn,n+1\n= \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn+1,n + \u03bb\n\u2211\nn\n\u2211\nn\nQ\u02dcn,n(\u03bb, \u03bb) umn,n+1 = \u03bbU + \u03bbU.\n34\nReferences\n[1] Acemog\u02d8lu, Daron and Robert Shimer, \u201cHoldup and Efficiency with Search Frictions.\u201d International\nEconomic Review, 47, 1999, 651-699.\n[2] Albrecht, Jim, and Susan Vroman, \u201cA Matching Model with Endogenous Skill Require-\nments,\u201dInternational Economic Review 43(1), 2002, 283-305.\n[3] Albrecht, James, Pieter A.
