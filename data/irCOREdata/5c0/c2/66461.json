INTRODUCTION\nThe n = 2 member of the Ruddleston-Popper fam-\nily of manganites forms a bilayer crystal with the gen-\neral formula La2\u22122xSr1+2xMn2O7. The crystal forms\na layered structure consisting of two MnO layers sepa-\nrated by a rock-salt type layer of (La,Sr)O. The result\nof this layering is an extremely two-dimensional crystal\nwith a = b = 3.87 A\u02da and c = 19.95 A\u02da (fig 1).\nThe La2\u22122xSr1+2xMn2O7 system presents a very com-\nplicated phase diagram. The discovery of colossal\nmagneto-resistance in the x = 0.4 bilayer1 triggered a\nflurry of interest in this compound2. Following this, nu-\nmerous studies have been conducted on the x = 0.5 dop-\ning level, showing strong charge and orbital order order.\nFar less work has been done on the overdoped crystals,\nhowever the work that has been done shows many inter-\nesting effects. Neutron studies reported that there exists\na number of distinct magnetic phases3 throughout the\nstochiometric range (fig. 2). In the area surrounding the\nhalf doped region 0.46 \u2264 x \u2264 0.66 the low temperature\nordering is in a type-A antiferromagnetic phase. Above\nthis there appears to be a gap where there exists no long\nrange magnetic or charge order. This is unique to the\nbilayer system, and is not observed either in the single\nlayered, or cubic, manganites. Above x = 0.74 long-\nrange ordering is reformed, but this time in a type-C\/C*\nmagnetic phase. Finally, above x = 0.9 the system enters\na type-G phase.\nIn this paper we will show data from the upper end\nof the type-A phase with 0.55 < x < 0.6. We have ap-\nplied resonant and high energy x-ray diffraction to look\nat the superlattice peaks associated with the charge and\norbital ordering as well as the structural distortions in\nthe compounds with x = 0.55, 0.575 and x = 0.6 dop-\ning levels. We observe a distinct change between the\nx = 0.55 and x = 0.575 doping levels, characterised by\nan increase in the phase transition temperature associ-\nated with both charge ordering and concomitant Jahn-\nTeller structural distortions (TCO\/JT ) coupled with a dis-\ncontinuous change in the ordering wavevector. We also\nreport a strong correlation between the Jahn-Teller dis-\ntortion peak intensity and the commensurability of the\nsuperlattice reflections in the x = 0.575 and 0.6 sam-\nples. The wavevector of the orbital order at low temper-\nature suggests a periodicity five times larger than that\nof the chemical unit cell in the ab plane. We propose a\n2FIG. 1: (color online) Crystal structure of\nLa2\u22122xSr1+2xMn2O7. Purple octahedra respresent MnO6\noctahedra, yellow spheres represent La\/Sr sites, and red\nspheres represent oxygen.\nquasi-bistripe phase of orbital order, complemented by a\nweak frustrated charge ordering. A charge and orbital\norder pattern has been constructed, and is proposed as\nthe structure in the range 0.55 < x < 0.625. Such a\nstructure would have a particular polarisation and az-\nimuthal dependence of the orbital order reflection which\nhas been simulated. Our experimental results at the Mn\nK edge confirm the predicted azimuthal dependence giv-\ning us confidence in the proposed structure observed us-\ning both resonant x-ray and high energy x-ray diffraction.\nThe orbital order is accompanied with a structural Jahn-\nTeller distortion, which appears to be more persistent\nand stable than in the half doped bilayer manganites.\nII. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS\nHigh quality single crystals of La2\u22122xSr1+2xMn2O7\nwere grown using the floating zone method at the Uni-\nversity of Oxford5. These crystals were pre-aligned using\nan in-house Cu K edge rotating anode system6. Experi-\nments were performed using high energy (100 keV) x-ray\nFIG. 2: (color online). Structural and phase diagram from\nQui et al.4 of the bilayer manganite. The region of interest\nin this paper is the area with diagonal black stripes around\nx = 0.6. In this paper we propose a different orbital and\ncharge order to that of the half doped bilayer.\ndiffraction and also resonant x-ray scattering at the Mn\nK edge.\nHigh energy x-ray diffraction was performed at the\nBW5 beamline at HASYLAB, Hamburg. The beamline\nis equipped with a wiggler and a water cooled Cu filter\nto produce x-rays in the spectral range 60-150 keV. The\nanalyser and monochromator were matched SiGe graded\ncrystals to provide a resolution matched to the sample\nrocking curve. The x-ray beam had an incident beam-\nsize of 1 \u00d7 1 mm, and an energy of 100 keV. Detection\nwas provided by a solid state detector, gated to remove\nharmonics using a single channel analyser\nThe samples were mounted on a the cold finger on\nan APD displex cryofurnace capable of a temperature\nrange 10 K< T < 400 K. Orientation was such that the c\naxis was parallel to the incident beam, and the ab plane\nperpendicular.\nResonant x-ray diffraction was undertaken at the\nXMaS UK CRG beamline at the ESRF7. An incident\nbeam energy in the region of 6.555 keV (Mn K edge)\nwas provided by a double bounce Si(111) water cooled\nmonochromator, with harmonic rejection mirrors. Crys-\ntals pre-cleaved with the c axis surface normal were\nmounted with the c axis along the scattering vector, al-\nlowing access to (00l) type reflections. The sample envi-\nronment was similar to that at BW5 with a closed circle\ncryostat held in a Eulerian cradle. A Cu (220) crystal\nwas used for polarization analysis which at 6.555 keV\nhas a scattering vector 47\u25e6 from the incident beam. This\nallows a leakthrough of \u223c 3.5% between the two polar-\nization channels.\nWe describe our results in the following three sections\norganized by doping stoichiometry, starting by the com-\nposition most similar to the well characterised x = 0.5\ncomposition.\n3A. x = 0.55\nThe sample was mounted on the high energy beamline.\nUpon cooling the sample below the charge ordering tem-\nperature (TCO) superlattice peaks appeared at wavevec-\ntors (h\u00b1\u03b4, k\u00b1\u03b4, l). These superlattice peaks, as have pre-\nviously been described, arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) struc-\ntural distortions. They were found regularly throughout\nreciprocal space with intensities \u223c15000 counts per sec-\nond. Secondary weaker superlattice peaks at (h\u00b1 2\u03b4, k\u00b1\n2\u03b4, l), corresponding to charge ordering (CO) of the nom-\ninal Mn3+ and Mn4+, were also found. The observed\nwavevectors of both these peaks require \u03b4 = 0.25. These\ncharge order satellite peaks were \u223c10 times weaker than\nthose of the JT distortions. The peak shapes from both\nthe JT and CO signals displayed a Gaussian lineshape\n(Figure 3). This suggests that the resolution was in-\nstrument limited. Indeed a measurement of the (2, 0, 0)\nBragg peak shows a similar width and shape. The peaks\nhad a far greater width in the [001] direction. This we\nattribute of the two-dimensional nature of the crystal\nstructure.\nThe x = 0.55 sample was cooled to the base tempera-\nture of 12 K, and the JT and CO peaks were measured\nupon warming. At each temperature thermal equilib-\nrium was achieved before the intensity and the width\nwere measured. In order to accurately measure the com-\nmensurate wavevector, the position of two satellite peaks\nopposite each other with respect to a Bragg peak was de-\ntermined. No significant change of the position or peak\nwidth was detected throughout the temperature range\n(Figure 4). The measured integrated intensity displayed\na significant increase at \u223c120 K and then reached a max-\nimum at TN (180 K). The intensity of the peaks then fell\nsharply with increasing temperature, until reaching back-\nground at 220 K. This behavior is extremely similar to\nthe x = 0.475 and 0.5 compounds. We did observe a\nslight increase in the transition temperatures (TN , TCO)\nof about 10 K compared to that in the x = 0.5 sample.\nB. x = 0.575\nThe only satellite peaks detected by high energy x-\nray diffraction were located at (h \u00b1 \u03b4, k \u00b1 \u03b4, l) positions.\nThese peaks associated with JT distortions were signifi-\ncantly weaker than those found in the x = 0.55 sample.\nComparing the relative intensities of the peak strength at\n\u00b12\u03b4 with that at \u00b1\u03b4 in the x = 0.55 system, a similarly\nproportioned signal in the x = 0.575 sample would have\nbeen extremely difficult to detect. As such we suspect\nthat charge ordering does exist but it is too weak for us\nto detect. The peak at (2\u2212\u03b4,\u2212\u03b4, 0) was much broader in\nthe x = 0.575 than in the x = 0.55 sample, and therefore\nthe measurements were not limited by the instrument res-\nolution. The shape of the peak was Lorentzian squared in\nthe high resolution [001] direction. This suggests a that\nthe resolution effects are negligible to the width of the\n2.22 2.23 2.24 2.25 2.26 2.27\n<100> [r.l.u.]\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\nCo\nun\nts \n[s-\n1  \nat\n 1\n20\n m\nA\n]\n1.49 1.495 1.5 1.505 1.51 1.515\n<100> [r.l.u.]\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nCo\nun\nts \n[s-\n1  \nat\n 1\n20\n m\nA\n]\n1.98 1.99 2 2.01 2.02\n<100> [r.l.u.]\n0\n1e+09\n2e+09\n3e+09\nCo\nun\nts \n[s-\n1  \nat\n 1\n20\n m\nA\n]\n(c)   Charge Order\n(b)   Jahn-Teller\n(a)  Bragg Peak\nFIG. 3: (color online) (2 + \u03b4, \u03b4, 0) The line shapes of the (a)\n(2,0,0) Bragg peak, (b) the Jahn-Teller (2\u2212 \u03b4,\u2212\u03b4, 0) and (c)\nthe charge order (2 \u2212 2\u03b4,\u22122\u03b4, 0) peaks taken at 170 K mea-\nsured from the x = 0.55 sample in the [100] direction.

Either the resonant signal is sen-\nsitive to the weak quadropole transition from the 1s\u22123d,\nor to the dipole transition into the 4p state, which is in-\nfluenced by the 3d level through Coulomb repulsion, or\nfinally, that it is sensitive the dipole transition to the 4p,\nwhich is effected by the nearest neighbour bond length\nand orbital occupation. The first possibility seems un-\nlikely as one would expect a difference in energy between\nthe quadropole and dipole magnetic signals, and as in\nV2O3\n8 it would be expected that both would be visible.\nElfimov et al.9 have suggested that the Coulomb inter-\naction proposed by Ishihara et al.10 is unlikely, and the\nconsensus seems to be that the final option is most prob-\nable. As such we are not looking at a direct probe of the\norbital order, we are looking at the co-operative Jahn-\nTeller distortion, which accompanies the orbital ordering.\nThe separation of these two phenomena does appear to\nbe possible using L edge diffraction where it has been\ndemonstrated in La0.5Sr1.5MnO4\n11,12.\n5The resonant signal of the (\u03b4, \u03b4, 10) was collected,\nwhich was found to resonate in both the \u03c3\u2212\u03c3 and \u03c3\u2212\u03c0\nchannels (fig 7). These resonances occurred at the same\nenergy as the absorption edge measured at the (0,0,10)\nBragg peak, and form Lorentzian lineshapes.\nThe cross section for resonant scattering from an elec-\ntron dipole transition (E1) can be written as follows\nfxresE1 = f0 + if1 + f2 (1)\nwhere the terms fn are given by\nf0 = (\u01eb\u02c6\n\u2032 \u00b7 \u01eb\u02c6) [F11 + F1\u22121] (2)\nf1 = \u2212(\u01eb\u02c6\n\u2032 \u00d7 \u01eb\u02c6) \u00b7 z\u02c6 [F11 \u2212 F1\u22121] (3)\nf2 = (\u01eb\u02c6\n\u2032 \u00b7 T\u02dc \u00b7 \u01eb\u02c6) [2F10 \u2212 F11 \u2212 F1\u22121]. (4)\nwhere \u01eb\u02c6 and \u01eb\u02c6\u2032 are the polarization vectors of the inci-\ndent and scattered beam respectively, z\u02c6 is a unit vector\nin the direction of the magnetic moment, and T\u02dc is the\nscattering tensor.\nFor \u03c3 polarized incident light, one would only expect\na signal to be present in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0 channel, if the signal\noriginates from the f1 term. However, the presence of\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 scattering indicates that the resonance occurs due\nto terms in f0 or f2. As terms in f0 are independent of ~Q\nwe believe the resonance to occur solely from the f2 term.\nAs expected these resonances can be fitted satisfactorily\nwith a Lorentzian lineshape, typical of a dipole transi-\ntion. The centre of these resonances occurs at 6.555 keV\ncorresponding to the Mn absorption edge observed of the\n(0,0,10) Bragg peak. This resonant energy is identical to\nthat seen in La1\u2212xCaxMnO3 by XANES by Bridges et\nal.13, who attribute this main peak to a dipole transition.\nThey also see weak pre-edge features \u223c 15 eV below this\nwhich could be due either to forbidden quadropole tran-\nsition or hybridization of the 4p level. We do not observe\nthese peaks by diffraction in the bilayer, however they\ncould be within our noise level.\nThe azimuthal angle dependence was collected by mea-\nsuring the integrated intensity of the superlattice peak\nin each polarization channel for a given azimuthal angle.\nDue to the simultaneous presence of a signal in both po-\nlarization channels we have calculated the polarization\nof the scattered x-ray beam by the stokes parameter as\ndefined by\nP1 (Stokes Parameter) =\nI\u03c3\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 I\u03c3\u2212\u03c0\nI\u03c3\u2212\u03c3 + I\u03c3\u2212\u03c0\n(5)\nThis has the effect of self-normalisation and removes\nany effect of angular changes in the size of the geometric\nbeam footprint. The integrated intensity of the signal\nin either channel was measured through a scan the po-\nlarization analyser angle \u03b8. It should be noted that the\nJahn-Teller structural distortion and the orbital ordering\nhave the same symmetry around the Mn3+ ion. As such\nthis azimuthal dependence is valid for both phenomena,\nindependant of any sensitivity arguments.\nA model of the charge and orbital order has been con-\nstructed for the high dopes phase (fig 6). This model\nwas made in such a way to agree with the fivefold peri-\nodicity. Using this model the azimuthal dependence has\nbeen calculated by using the Anisotropy of the Tensor of\nSusceptibility (ATS). On resonance the scattering on a\nmanganese site is given by a tensor T\u02dc due to the local\nsite symmetry D4h\n14. We therefore calculate the total\nstructure factor from all manganese sites for the reflec-\ntion (0.2,0.2,10) in the unit to obtain a single scattering\ntensor T\u02dc00. The structure factor can then be calculated\nby\nT\u02dc00 =\n4\u2211\ni=1\nT\u02dcD4hi e\ni ~Q\u00b7~ri (6)\nWhere ~Q is the scattering vector and ~ri are the posi-\ntions of each of the four Mn3+ ions.\nThe intensity can therefore be calculated using the fol-\nlowing formula\nI = |\u01eb\u02c6\u2032 \u00b7 T\u02dc00 \u00b7 \u01eb\u02c6|\n2 (7)\nThe azimuthal dependence of the (\u03b4, \u03b4,10) superlattice\npeak is displayed in (Fig. 8), together with the results of\nthe simulation. The experimentally determined Stokes\nParameter does not fall to -1 as predicted by the ATS\nsimulation. This is due to the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 signal being much\nlarger than the \u03c3\u2212\u03c0 and so even a relatively small \u03c3\u2212\u03c3\nsignal dramatically increases the parameter value. This\nsmall \u03c3\u2212\u03c3 signal could be due to small amount of back-\nground scatter present in this channel. Overall though,\nthere is a general agreement between the fit and the data,\nsuggesting a correct model of the orbital anisotropy has\nbeen used.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThe distinct change in the behavoir of the bilayer sug-\ngests that the higher doping, where x \u2265 0.575 (high-\ndoped region) forms a second \u2018sub\u2019 phase within the\ncharge ordered regime. Here the JT distortion, and most\nprobably the charge order, display strikingly different be-\nhavior than that observed for x \u2264 0.55 (mid-doped re-\ngion). The behavior of the x = 0.55 sample can be seen to\nbe very similar to the lower dopings by comparing with\nresults presented by Wilkins et al.15. The interaction\nbetween the AFM order below TN and the orbital and\ncharge ordering appears to be unique to the bilayer man-\nganites. The onset of the AFM ordering simultaneously\nreduces the intensity of the in-plane ordering. It was orig-\ninally thought that the CO completely collapsed16 and\nthen was re-entrant again at lower temperatures. This\n6FIG. 6: (color online).

Similar behavoir was\nalso seen in x = 0.475 and 0.515. It has been suggested\nthat a spin freezing occurs below 100 K17, which cor-\nresponds to the minimum in the charge order reflection\nintensity. This suggests that there are spin fluctuations\noccuring below TN which gradually slow to form a spin-\nfrozen state at 100 K.\nUnlike previous reports18,19 we do not observe a\nsmooth transition of the wavevector with doping level.\nIt was suggested that \u03b4 follows the trend \u03b4 = (1 \u2212 x)\/2,\nhowever we observe discrete changes in the wavevector,\nand in particular the wavevector is not stable throughout\n6.53 6.54 6.55 6.56 6.57 6.58\nEnergy [keV]\n0\n10\n20\nCo\nun\nts \n[s-\n1  \nat\n 2\n00\n m\nA\n]\n \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\n \u03c3 \u2212pi\n(0 0 10) Bragg Peak (scaled)\nFIG. 7: (color online) The energy dependence of the orbital\nsignal at the Mn K edge measured in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2212\npi channels.

Al-\nthough this trend undoubtedly seems true in general, we\nsuggest that \u03b4 moves to the closest stable commensurate\nposition (see table I).\nThe enhanced stability of the JT distorted phase was\nshown before by Campbell et al.20, however no explana-\ntion was given for this. We present a model showing a\nstable ordering of the JT distortions around the x = 0.6\ndoping, however this doesn\u2019t explain why it is stable to a\nhigher temperature than the x = 0.5 structure. Indeed it\nis interesting that it appears that the distortions in high\ndoping region appear to have a much shorter correlation\nlength (see Table I and fig. 9) than those in the mid doped\nregion, and yet the superlattice peaks persevere to a high\n7TABLE I: Position and inverse correlation lengths of the\nJahn-Teller peaks with respect to the doping of the sample.\nInverse correlation lengths are measured at peak intensity, \u03b4\nis taken at base temperature.\nx Position at 10 K Inverse Correlation Length\n(\u03b4) (10\u22122 A\u02da\n\u22121\n)\n0.475a 0.25 0.19\n0.5a 0.25 0.19\n0.55 0.25 \u22640.6\n0.575 0.20 2.3\n0.6 0.20 1.4\naData taken from Wilkins et al.15\n-0.08 -0.06 -0.04 -0.02 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\nReciprocal Lattice Units\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nN\nor\nm\nal\nise\nd \nCo\nun\nts \n[ar\nb. \nun\nits\n] x = 0.575\nx = 0.6\nx = 0.55\nFIG. 9: (color online) Comparison of the Jahn-Teller super-\nlattice peaks in the x = 0.55, 0.575, 0.60 samples.

The significant change in correlation length\nbetweeen the x = 0.55, and the x = 0.575 adds evidence\nfor a phase transition between these doping levels.\nThe mid-doped region showed very little change in\nthe wavevector of the superlattice peaks, the position of\nwhich is adequately explained using the chequerboard\nand CE-type model. In the higher doped structure this\nsymmetry breaks down, and the positions of the superlat-\ntice peaks align at incommensurate values. In addition,\nthese values change as the intensity changes with tem-\nperature. This direct relation between the propagation\nvector of the superlattice cell and the amplitude of that\ncell has not been seen to this extent in other manganite.\nIt suggests a dynamic stripe system that changes configu-\nration as the degree of charge segregation alters. In order\nto understand this ordered system, we first have to un-\nderstand the origin of the low temperature propagation\nwavevector.\nThe high doped charge order phase, seems to be less\ncorrelated than the mid dopings. The inverse correlation\nlength of both the JT and charge ordering (calculated\nthrough the width of the superlattice peaks) remain con-\nstant at all temperatures, for each of the samples. The\nsuperlattice peak in the x = 0.55 sample had a maximum\ninverse correlation length of \u03b6 \u2264 6.3\u00d710\u22123 A\u02da\n\u22121\n, whereas\nthe peaks from x = 0.575 and x = 0.6 doped samples\nwere \u03b6 = 2.3\u00d710\u22122 A\u02da\n\u22121\nand \u03b6 = 1.4\u00d710\u22122 A\u02da\n\u22121\nrespec-\ntively. This difference is clearly shown in figure 9, where\nthe x = 0.55 sample JT peak is fitted to a Gaussian line-\nshape, and the much broader JT peaks from the high\ndoped phase are fitted to Lorentzian squared lineshapes.\nSubstantial discussion was generated after the original\ndiscovery of the charge ordered systems in the ABMnO3\ncompounds, as to the relative merits of the bi-stripe21\n(BS) and Wigner22 crystal (WC) models23,24,25. These\nmodels provided solutions to the orbital ordering of com-\npounds where the ratio of nominally Mn3+ and Mn4+ is\nnot 1:1. These same arguments can be applied to the\nbilayer crystal. Here it appears that we have an ordering\nthat lies midway between these models and the checker-\nboard pattern. The lowest stable BS and WC models\nhave x = 0.66, with an orbital orbit propagation vector\n(2\u03c0\/a)(1\n3\n, 0, 0). Here we have a doping level less than\nthis, and the position of the superlattice peaks displays\na larger propagation vector. A satisfactory model of this\nmid-point is displayed in figure 6. This 2-1 stripe model\nhas similarities to both models mentioned above. The\nslipage distance between successive Mn3+ ions alters, as\none see in the BS model, however the correlation in these\nspecies in the [110] direction, is similar to the WC sys-\ntem. The opposition of the direction of the orbitals of\nthe stripe pairs is necessary for the observed wavevector\nfrom the JT superlattice. This can be understood as sim-\nple exchange of the orbitals between a single Mn4+ and\nsuperexchange between two nominal Mn4+ ions.\nIncreasing the temperature of the sample alters both\nthe intensity and the incommensurate state of the charge\nordered peaks of the high doped phase. The wavevector \u03b4\nincreases, however does not reach the stable mid-doping\n\u03b4 = 0.25. As \u03b4 increases we can imagine the 2-1 stripe\nmodel gradually turning into the mid-doped stripe phase\nby losing double stripes. The incommensurability reaches\na point of maximum intensity where every other double\nstripe is now a single stripe and so instead of a double\nstripe and then a single stripe repeated, there is now a\ndouble stripe and then two single stripes before a sec-\nond double stripe. It would be expected that this model\nwould not be well correlated as there are not sufficient\nMn3+ ions. As the temperature increases further, and\nthe intensity decreases, \u03b4 falls back to the \u03b4 = 0.2 high\ndoped phase value.\nThe measurements of the azimuthal dependence of the\norbital order is a method of testing the order model. Dif-\nferent orbital patterns result in a different azimuthal de-\npendence and the strong agreement between calculated\nand measured values corresponds to this model. A sim-\nilar study has been reported by Di Matteo et al.26, on\nthe x = 0.5 doped bilayer. In their paper they simu-\n8lated the traditional Jahn-Teller distorted checkerboard\npattern and found an excellent agreement with their ex-\nperimental data.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented results from high resolution x-ray\nscattering studies of La1+2xSr2\u22122xMn207 where x = 0.55,\n575 and 0.6. It is clearly demonstrated that there is a\ndistinct change in the nature of the charge ordering and\naccompanying Jahn-Teller distortion at 0.55 < x < 0.575\nThe x = 0.55 sample shows very similar behavior to\nthat seen in x = 0.5, whereas the x \u2265 0.575 samples\nshow ordering with a much lower correlation. A strik-\ning incommensurate behaviour is also seen in this higher\ndoped charge ordered phase. A new model containing\nquasi-bistripe ordering is proposed, and the measured\nazimuthal dependence of the orbital order agrees with\nthis model. We suggest that this quasi-bistripe ordering\nwould turn into a true bistripe order as the doping level\nis increased further towards x = 0.66.\nV.
