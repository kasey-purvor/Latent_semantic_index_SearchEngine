The same mechanism produces behaviorally relevant changes in response timing that can be understood in the context of an animal's altered behavioral state. For individual animals of either phase, different looming objects elicited different spiking responses in a visual looming detector interneuron, descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), yet its synaptic drive to a leg motoneuron, fast extensor tibiae (FETi), always had the same maximum amplitude. Gregarious locust DCMDs produced more action potentials and had higher firing frequencies, but individual postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) elicited in FETi were half the amplitude of those in solitarious locusts. A model suggested that this alone could not explain the similarity in overall amplitude, and we show that facilitation increased the maximum compound PSP amplitude in gregarious animals. There was the same linear relationship between times of peak DCMD firing before collision and the size\/velocity of looming objects in both phases.

The DCMD-FETi synapse transformed this relationship nonlinearly, such that peak amplitudes of\ncompound PSPs occurred disproportionately earlier for smaller\/faster objects. Furthermore, the peak PSP amplitude occurred earlier in\ngregarious than in solitarious locusts, indicating a differential tuning. Homeostatic modulation of the amplitude, together with a non-\nlinear synaptic transformation of timing, acted together to tune the DCMD-FETi system so that swarming gregarious locusts respond\nearlier to small moving objects, such as conspecifics, than solitarious locusts.\nKey words: homeostatic plasticity; sensory-motor integration; DCMD; nonlinear transformation; locust; phenotypic plasticity\nIntroduction\nImposed disturbances of neuronal activity can lead to compen-\nsatory changes in synapses, neurons, or networks through pro-\ncesses collectively known as homeostatic plasticity (Turrigiano,\n1999; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000, 2004). We characterize ho-\nmeostatic plasticity at an identified synapse in twomorphs of the\nsame species. The morphs differ physiologically, morphologi-\ncally, and behaviorally, adapting them to changing environmen-\ntal conditions and population density. A sensory-motor transfer\nfunction at the synapse, thought to be important in collision\navoidance behavior, is homeostatically modulated so that the\nmaximum response amplitude is maintained. Nevertheless, re-\nsponse timing is modified by this plasticity in a way that can be\ndirectly related to behavioral adaptations appropriate for their\ndifferent environments.\nThe desert locust Schistocerca gregaria shows a radical, but\nfully reversible, form of phenotypic plasticity (phase change) that\ninvolves changes in behavior, morphology physiology, neuro-\nchemistry and neuronal function (Uvarov, 1966, 1977; Simpson\net al., 1999; Matheson et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2004). Locusts\ngenerally occur at low population densities (\u00013\/100 m2) in the\n\u201csolitarious phase.\u201d They are cryptic in appearance and behavior,\nthey are sedentary, and they actively avoid other locusts. In con-\ntrast, locusts in the notorious swarming \u201cgregarious phase\u201d occur\nat high population densities (\u0002100,000\/100m2) and are conspic-\nuous, very active, and attracted toward other locusts, forming\ncohesive groups. Phase change in locusts provides a powerful\nmodel system with which to analyze a whole suite of reversible\nbehavioral and neuronal plasticities.\nThe responses of an identified visual interneuron, the de-\nscending contralateral movement detector (DCMD), differ\nmarkedly between the solitarious and gregarious phases (Mathe-\nson et al., 2004). Spikes in DCMD follow spikes in its presynaptic\nneuron, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) (O\u2019Shea\nandWilliams, 1974) with a 1:1 relationship. LGMD produces the\nhighest spiking frequencies to looming visual objects on collision\ncourse with the locust, which elicit spike bursts of increasing\nfrequency as the approaching object expands across the visual\nfield (Schlotterer, 1977; Rind and Simmons, 1992; Simmons and\nRind, 1992). DCMDconveys the output of LGMD from the brain\nto interneurons andmotoneurons involved in flight steering and\njumping (Burrows and Rowell, 1973; Pearson et al., 1980; Sim-\nmons, 1980; Santer et al., 2005a, 2006).\nWe analyzed the response of one motoneuron that receives\nmonosynaptic input fromDCMD, themetathoracic fast extensor\nReceived Oct. 24, 2006; revised March 20, 2007; accepted March 21, 2007.\nThis work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (United Kingdom).

These phase-related differences\nin DCMD firing rate, postsynaptic poten-\ntial (PSP) amplitude, and synaptic facilita-\ntion serve to counteract each other so that\nthe compound PSPs in FETi have the same\namplitude in both phases. The altered\nproperties of the DCMD-FETi synapse,\nhowever, advance the timing of the peak\namplitude of the compound PSP relative\nto collision for small\/fast objects in gregar-\nious locusts compared with solitarious\nlocusts.\nMaterials andMethods\nAnimal rearing. Experiments were performed\non desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria Forsk\u00e5l)\nof both sexes 1\u20132 weeks after they had moulted\nto adulthood. Gregarious phase locusts were\nobtained from cultures at the Universities of\nCambridge and Oxford, UK, which are main-\ntained under high population densities\n(\u00034000\/m3), and fed on seedling wheat and\nwheat bran flakes. Phase change occurs over\nseveral different time scales from hours to gen-\nerations, with phase state transmitted epige-\nnetically to offspring. Solitarious animals regain\ngregarious behavioral characteristics within as\nlittle as 4 h of recrowding, but other morpho-\nlogical and physiological reversions back to the\ngregarious state take longer, accumulating\nslowly over the lifespan or even over the course\nof several generations of isolation or crowding.\nThe properties of DCMD (Matheson et al.,\n2004) appear to change within one generation\nof isolation of gregarious locusts (S. M. Rogers,\npersonal observation). The solitarious phase\nanimals used were the third-generation descen-\ndents of locusts from theOxford gregarious col-\nony that had each been reared in individual\ncages under visual, olfactory, and tactile isola-\ntion from other locusts, using husbandry pro-\ncedures described by Roessingh et al. (1993).\nSuch animals exhibit strongly solitarious mor-\nphological, physiological, and behavioral phe-\nnotypes (Simpson et al., 1999). Cambridge an-\nimals were maintained at 37\u201325\u00b0C under an\n18\/6 h light\/dark photoperiod, whereas Oxford\nanimals experienced a 12\/12 h photoperiod at a\nconstant temperature of 30\u0004 2\u00b0C.\nDissection and recording. Animals were\nmounted ventral side up in a plastic holder and\nrestrained using Plasticine such that the right\neye had an unimpeded visual field. The head\nwas fixed into positionwith bees wax so that the\nlong axis of the compound eye was vertical and\nthe cervical membrane stretched. The cervical\ncuticle and underlying air sacs were removed to\nexpose the ventral nerve cord.

DCMD has the largest amplitude ac-\ntion potentials in extracellular recordings of a cervical connective so\nspike times could be obtained simply by using an amplitude threshold.\nThe response of DCMD to visual stimuli delivered to the contralateral\neye is unique in these recordings, so therewas no ambiguity in identifying\nthe neuron. A second window in the cuticle was made in the ventral\nsurface of the thorax to expose the mesothoracic and metathoracic gan-\nglia. A wax-coated silver platform, which acted as the indifferent elec-\ntrode, was inserted under these ganglia. Great care was taken not to\ndamage any of the tracheae supplying the metathoracic ganglion as any\ninterruption of the air supply rapidly abolished the activity of the\nDCMD-FETi synapse. Intracellular recordingsweremade from the soma\nof FETi using thin-walled glass microelectrodes filled with 1 M potassium\nacetate (resistance of 20\u201330M\u0006). FETiwas identified by its location and the\noccurrence of an antidromic spike in the soma evoked by electrical stimula-\ntion of the extensor tibiae muscle of the hindleg. Recordings of the input\nresistance of FETi were made using single electrode clamp with either an\nAxoclamp-2a amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) or an NPI\nElectronics (Tamm, Germany) amplifier in discontinuous current clamp\nmode set with switching rates between 5 and 10 kHz.\nData were recorded on a computer using a Cambridge Electronic De-\nsign (Cambridge, UK) micro1401 interface and Spike 2 (version 5.08;\nCambridge Electronic Design) software. DCMD signals were sampled at\n25 kHz and FETi at 6.16 kHz. Stable recordings weremaintained from 40\nmin to several hours. Data from recordings in which the height of the\nantidromic spike in FETi had decreased by\u000220% over the course of an\nexperiment were not analyzed. Experiments were performed at 24\u201327\u00b0C.\nVisual stimulation. In an initial set of experiments to determine the\nrelative sizes of single PSPs in solitarious and gregarious locusts, a small\nprobe (a 5 mm square flag on a stick) was moved by hand in front of the\nvisual field at a distance of 20\u2013200 mm from the eye. This stimulated\nDCMD to fire spikes at low frequency (1\u20135 Hz) and elicited correspond-\ning PSPs in FETi (n\u0007 42 solitarious locusts, 25 locusts from the Oxford\ngregarious colony, and 10 from a genetically unrelated gregarious colony\nmaintained at the Department of Zoology, Cambridge University, Cam-\nbridge, UK).\nThe principal experiments analyzed the response of DCMD-FETi to\nlooming stimuli and used the controlled visual stimulation protocol de-\nveloped by Gabbiani et al. (1999) as modified by Matheson et al. (2004).\nLocusts were placed 60 mm from the 100\u0005 120 mm screen of a Tektro-\nnix (Wilsonville, OR) CRT (model 608) with the right eye aligned pre-\ncisely to its center in both vertical and horizontal directions. Themonitor\nhad a refresh rate of 185 Hz and a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm (angular\nresolution at 60mm, 0.48\u00b0)well above the temporal resolution andbelow\nthe spatial resolution of the locust compound eyes (Wilson, 1975; Hor-\nridge, 1978; Howard, 1981). The monitor was controlled by a Picasso\nimage synthesizer (Innisfree, Cambridge, MA) driven by the output of\nthe Cambridge Electronic Design data acquisition system.\nThe stimuli simulated the last 5 s of approach before collision of a dark\nsquare object against a light background (52% contrast). The objects\nappeared in the center of the screen in line with the eye and expanded to\nsubtend an angle of 80\u00b0 to the eye. On reachingmaximum size just before\ncollision, the stimulus remained static for 500 ms and then disappeared.\nThe rate of expansion of an approaching object depends on both its size\nand velocity but can be defined by a single ratio, l\/|v| , where l is the half\nsize of the object and v is the approach velocity of the object (Gabbiani et\nal., 1999). We used stimuli of l\/|v| \u0007 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 ms, which\ncorresponds to, for example, square objects 10\u2013160 mm across, ap-\nproaching at a constant velocity of 2 m s\b1, or alternatively to a 50 mm\nsquare approaching at 10\u20130.05m s\b1. Because of their larger size (or\nlower approach velocity), objects with a larger l\/|v| first appear on the\nscreen at a larger size (ranging from 0.9\u00b0 visual angle for l\/|v| \u0007 2.5ms to\n1.4\u00b0 for l\/|v| \u0007 40 ms) and expand more slowly during the simulated\napproach (Gabbiani et al., 1999).\nAfter establishing an intracellular recording of FETi, all locusts were\nleft for 8\u201310 min to allow DCMD to fully dishabituate before the start of\nthe experiment (our personal observation). The analyses of responses to\nlooming stimuli are based on data gathered from nine gregarious and\nnine solitarious phase locusts. All of these were stimulated by l\/|v| \u0007 20\nms for 10 approaches at 1 min intervals to analyze the effect of DCMD\nhabituation on FETi response. After this, all locusts except for one soli-\ntarious individual were tested with single stimuli of l\/|v| \u0007 5\u201340 ms\npresented in random order at 8 min intervals. In a few experiments, l\/|v|\n\u0007 2.5 ms was also used. To examine the amplitudes of individually\nevoked PSPs in FETi, DCMD was also stimulated with the same small\nvisual stimulus used in the preliminary experiments described above.\nData analysis. Times of DCMD spikes were expressed as times relative\nto collision (which occurred at time\u0007 0). The time course of the DCMD\nresponse was analyzed by convolving a Gaussian smoothing filter with\ntheDCMD spike times using Spike 2 software. TheGaussian distribution\nhad a SD of 20 ms and amplitude of 25.1 Hz. The use of Gaussian\nsmoothing avoids artifacts caused by the temporal binning usually used\nto generate peristimulus time histograms (Gabbiani et al., 1999). It also\nremoves problems associated with doublet spikes in DCMD producing\ntransiently high instantaneous frequencies and emphasizes the time at\nwhich DCMD rises to a sustained high firing rate (see Fig. 3). Peak\nDCMD spike frequencies and the time of peak firing relative to collision\nwere obtained from these smoothed data. Linear regressions were fitted\nto the data to compare the effects of different values of l\/|v| on the\nresponses of DCMD and FETi for each individual animal. The coeffi-\ncients of these regressionswere then compared using t tests (SPSS version\n10.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) to determine the significance of any differences\nbetween phases, thus avoiding the problem of repeated measurements\nfrom individual locusts.\nModel. We modeled the expected response of FETi to stimulation by\nDCMD by convolving a single PSP template with the times of DCMD\nspikes. The PSP templates were generated for both solitarious and gre-\ngarious locusts by fitting a sigmoid rising function and simple exponen-\ntial decay function to an averaged PSP calculated from data from all\nsuccessful recordings. Average PSPs were generated from n \u0007 40\u201350\naveraged single PSPs obtained from low-frequency stimulation of\nDCMD from n\u0007 9 locusts of each phase. Latencies from a DCMD spike\nto the start of the rising phase of the PSP template were adjusted tomatch\nthe experimentally measured latencies for each recording.

Therefore, we used extracellular stimulation\napplied to the cervical connective to drive DCMD. A pair of stimulating\nhook electrodes was placed around the cervical connectives positioned\nsuch that there was a good contact with the dorsomedial surface of the\nconnective, near the axon of DCMD. A second pair of extracellular elec-\ntrodes was placed around the connectives connecting the prothoracic\nand mesothoracic ganglia to record the spike evoked by the electrical\nstimulus. FETi was recorded intracellularly as detailed above. The stim-\nulus voltage was adjusted so that it just evoked a spike as recorded by the\nextracellular electrodes downstream. In most preparations, this spike\nshape closely resembled that of DCMD, which, because of its large size\nand proximity to the stimulation site, was preferentially stimulated at the\nthreshold voltage (2\u20133 V, depending on the preparation). Because of the\nrisk of stimulating other axons adjacent to DCMD, which could, in prin-\nciple, also synapse onto FETi, we compared the PSPs elicited by electri-\ncally driven spikes with PSPs elicited by visually stimulating DCMD to\nensure that they had the same amplitude and latency (see Results). At\nthreshold stimulation voltage, this was invariably the case, and it was\ntherefore highly likely that both visually and electrically elicited PSPs in\nFETi derived from DCMD. Because DCMD has the largest axon diame-\nter in the connective and therefore presumably the fastest conduction\nvelocity, PSPs driven by any other axonswould have had a longer latency,\nwhich was never the case. Preparations in which the evoked extracellular\nspike was dissimilar to DCMD and did not elicit PSPs in FETi were not\nanalyzed. Five locusts of each phase were tested with stimulus trains\nconsisting of 10 pulses each 0.05ms in duration spaced at 30ms intervals.\nThe stimulus train was repeated 20\u2013100 times at 50 s intervals.\nResults\nDCMD-evoked PSPs in FETi are larger in solitarious locusts\nDCMD spikes evoked PSPs in FETi (Fig. 1), with a consistent\nlatency for individual animals (4.2 \u0004 0.85 ms in solitarious and\n3.8 \u0004 0.43 ms in gregarious locusts not significantly different\nbetween phases; t11.8 \u0007 \b1.08; p \u0007 0.301; n \u0007 18 locusts). The\nlong latency for this monosynaptic connection is attributable to\nthe long conduction time down the DCMD axon from the re-\ncording site in the neck. DCMD responded at low frequencies to\na small object moving randomly across the visual field and when\nfiring at\u000135 spikes s\b1, the resulting PSPs in FETi did not sum-\nmate (Fig. 1A). In gregarious locusts, these single PSPswere small\nand often difficult to discern amid the ongoing synaptic inputs\nfrom other sources, but they could be retrieved by DCMD spike-\ntriggered averages (Fig. 1A, inset top). In contrast, in solitarious\nanimals, the single PSPs in FETi were much larger and always\napparent above background synaptic inputs.\nIn an initial experiment, solitarious phase locusts from the\nOxford colony were compared with two groups of gregarious\nlocusts: one from the parent colony of the solitarious locusts at\nOxford and the other a genetically distinct population main-\ntained at Cambridge (Fig. 1B). In solitarious locusts, the average\nPSP amplitude (0.37\u0004 0.13mV) was over twice the amplitude of\nthe PSPs evoked in either of the gregarious populations, which\nwere similar to each other (Oxford gregarious, 0.18 \u0004 0.09 mV;\nCambridge gregarious, 0.17\u0004 0.05 mV; ANOVA, F(2, 74)\u0007 27.5;\np\u0001 0.001).

Neurosci., April 25, 2007 \u2022 27(17):4621\u20134633 Rogers et al. \u2022 Compensatory Plasticity Tunes a Visuomotor Pathway\nFETi to looming objects were tested (Fig. 1C) (solitarious PSP\namplitude, 0.41 \u0004 0.18 mV; gregarious PSP amplitude, 0.19 \u0004\n0.08 mV; t16 \u0007 3.6; p \u0007 0.003). The time constant of PSP decay\ndid not differ significantly between phases (solitarious, 12.7\u0004 6.0\nms; gregarious, 17.3\u0004 8.3 ms; t16\u0007\b1.348; p\u0007 0.196).\nWe therefore sought possible mechanisms that could explain\nthe differences in PSP amplitudes between phases. First, we mea-\nsured the input resistance of FETi, which was significantly lower\nin solitarious locusts than in gregarious as measured in the soma\n(Fig. 1D) (to positive current 9.3\u0004 0.3M\u0006 in solitarious, 13.3\u0004\n0.39M\u0006 in gregarious; t22\u0007 2.73; p\u0007 0.012). From this result, it\nwould be expected that DCMD-evoked PSPs recorded in the\nsoma of FETi would be smaller in solitarious than gregarious\nlocusts, all other factors being equal. Antidromic spikes in FETi,\nwhich are passively reflected in the soma, for example, were\nslightly but not significantly smaller in solitarious locusts (soli-\ntarious, 9.3 \u0004 2.09 mV; gregarious, 9.9 \u0004 3.14 mV; t16 \u0007 0.512;\np\u0007 0.616). The observedDCMD-PSP amplitude data in FETi are\nthe opposite of this, however. Second, the time constant of FETi\nwas also similar between phases (average across all experiments,\n11.5\u0004 2.4ms). A third possible mechanismwould be differences\nin the waveform of DCMD spikes, because change in presynaptic\nspike amplitude or width can alter the strength of synaptic trans-\nmission (Jackson et al., 1991; Burrows andMatheson, 1994; Nus-\nbaum et al., 1997; Niven and Burrows, 2003). Intracellular re-\ncordings of DCMDmade in its axon as it leaves themesothoracic\nganglion (Fig. 2A, waveform) revealed that spike width (solitari-\nous, 1.2 \u0004 0.32 ms; gregarious, 1.4 \u0004 0.49 ms; t20 \u0007 0.746; p \u0007\n0.465), spike height (solitarious, 61.7 \u0004 25.1 mV; gregarious,\n54.8 \u0004 29.6 mV; t20 \u0007 0.874; p \u0007 0.573), and resting potential\n(solitarious,\b65.2\u0004 7.4 mV; gregarious,\b63.0\u0004 13.6 mV; t16\n\u0007 0.41; p \u0007 0.69) were similar in both phases. In gregarious\nlocusts, however, the duration of the spike afterpotential was\nsignificantly longer (4.4\u0004 1.4 compared with 2.9\u0004 0.4 ms; t14.4\n\u0007 3.69; p \u0007 0.002). Conduction velocity was also 12% faster in\ngregarious locusts (measured between the cervical extracellular\nrecording and intracellular recordings in the mesothoracic gan-\nglion; gregarious 3.9\u0004 0.48m\/s, solitarious 3.4\u0004 0.36m\/s; t20\u0007\n2.4; p \u0007 0.025) (Fig. 2). Therefore, we conclude that the larger\nDCMD-FETi PSP amplitude in solitarious locusts arises from\nalterations in the transmission strength of the synapse itself, not\nfrom alterations in the passive membrane properties of either\nneuron.\nResponses of DCMD to looming stimuli\nDCMD responds to looming stimuli with a burst of spikes that\nescalates in frequency as the retinal size of the approaching object\nincreases in an expansive nonlinear way. The spike frequency\nreaches amaximumand then declines, generally before the end of\nobject expansion, depending on the size (l) and\/or velocity (v) of\nthe object. The response properties of DCMD differed between\nphases and with l\/|v|. Increasing l\/|v| (i.e., increasing object size\nand\/or decreasing approach velocity) evoked more DCMD\nspikes in both phases (Fig. 3A). In gregarious locusts, however,\nspike numbers were higher for all values of l\/|v| than in solitari-\nous, with the difference between phases growing as l\/|v| increased\n(Fig. 3A, Table 1). For example, at l\/|v|\u0007 5 ms, 37\u0004 4.7 DCMD\nspikes were elicited in gregarious locusts compared with 28\u0004 6.4\nspikes in solitarious (a difference of 32%), but for objects of l\/|v|\n\u0007 40 ms, the difference had increased to 70% (99\u0004 16.7 DCMD\nspikes in gregarious compared with 59 \u0004 14.6 spikes in solitari-\nous). Conversely, increasing l\/|v| led to a decrease in the peak\nfiring rate of DCMD (Fig. 3B). Gregarious locusts had consis-\nGregarious\n20ms\n40ms\n1mV\n1s\n100o\nSolitarious\n5ms\nFETi\nDCMD\nangle\nl\/ v\nDCMD\nFrequency\n10ms\n200Hz instantaneous DCMD rate\n100Hz Gaussian Filtered DCMD data\nFigure 4.

The\nleft column shows a representative recording from a solitarious locust during stimulation with\nlooming objects of different values of l\/|v|, whereas the right column shows corresponding\nresponses in a gregarious locust. The data are from the top: the intracellular FETi response, the\ninstantaneous DCMD firing rate (dots) and the Gaussian smoothed data (gray lines), the extra-\ncellular response of DCMD; and bottom, the angle subtended by the stimulus at the retina.\nRogers et al. \u2022 Compensatory Plasticity Tunes a Visuomotor Pathway J. Neurosci., April 25, 2007 \u2022 27(17):4621\u20134633 \u2022 4625\ntently higher peak firing rates at all values of l\/|v|, but the relation-\nship between firing rate and l\/|v|was similar for both phases (Fig.\n3B, Table 1). For example, at l\/|v|\u0007 5 ms, the mean peak DCMD\nfiring rate was 266 \u0004 44 spikes s\b1 for gregarious locusts com-\npared with 200\u0004 45 spikes s\b1 for solitarious locusts. By l\/|v|\u0007\n40 ms, the peak rate had fallen to 221\u0004 44 spikes s\b1 and 158\u0004\n24 spikes s\b1 respectively, a differential between phases of 33\u2013\n40% across the entire stimulus range.\nThe time of peak DCMD firing relative to collision occurred\nearlier with increasing l\/|v| (Fig. 3C), and this pattern did not\ndiffer between phases. This is in agreement with our previous\nanalyses (Gabbiani et al., 1999; Matheson et al., 2004). The mean\ntime of peak firing relative to collision ranged from\b1.2\u0004 30.2\nms for l\/|v|\u0007 5ms decreasing to\b165\u0004 37ms for objects of l\/|v|\n\u0007 40 ms, where negative values are times before collision.\nResponse characteristics of FETi to looming stimuli\nDuring the presentation of a looming object, the frequency of\nDCMD firing increased, and the evoked PSPs in FETi summated\nto form sharply peaked compound PSPs (Fig. 4; mean values in\nFig. 5). The areas underneath the compound PSPs increased with\nl\/|v|, corresponding to the increasing number of DCMD spikes\n(Figs. 4, 5), and the compound PSPswere similar in shape in both\nphases (Fig. 5, overlaid averages are shown in the right column).\nThe maximum amplitudes of the compound PSPs were also re-\nmarkably consistent and did not differ with l\/|v| or between\nphases [mean 1.8\u0004 0.61 mV (Fig. 6A,E); neither intercepts nor\ngradients of the regressions were significantly different between\nphases (Table 1)]. This constancy occurred despite the pro-\nnounced differences in DCMD response both between phases\nand to different visual stimuli, and the considerable phase-related\ndifference in the amplitude of individual DCMD evoked PSPs in\nFETi (Fig. 1C).\nFor solitarious locusts, the predicted compound PSP in FETi,\nmade by convolving recorded DCMD spike trains with PSP tem-\nplates that matched the size and shape of the single PSPs (evoked\nat a low rate; see Materials and Methods), closely approximated\nthe maximum amplitude and shape of the compound PSPs re-\ncorded in FETi (Fig. 6B\u2013E). If the model was a good predictor of\nthe DCMD-FETi synapse, then the ratio of the model single PSP\nto the maximum convolved PSP should be the same as the ratio\nbetween the measured single PSP and the recorded maximum\namplitude of the compound PSP. In the case of solitarious lo-\ncusts, this was indeed the case, as the values cluster around the\ndotted line indicating ratios of the same value (Fig. 6C,D, black\nsymbols). Because both the X and Y data have statistical errors\nassociated with them, the data form a cloud about this line rather\nthan a perfect linear relationship. The gregarious locust data\nwere, for the most part, well to the right of this line of equivalent\nratio between model and experimental data, indicating that the\nmeasured values for maximum compound PSP amplitude were\nconsiderably greater than those predicted from themodel and the\namplitudes of individual gregarious PSPs (Fig. 6C,D, gray sym-\nbols). The convolved waveform followed the inflections of the\nrecorded compound PSPs well, but the amplitude of the simula-\ntion fell increasingly below the recorded data over the course of a\nlooming stimulus (Fig. 6B).\nThere were only small differences between the recorded and\npredicted amplitudes for solitarious locusts (model mean, 1.7\u0004\n0.60 mV; actual mean, 1.8 \u0004 0.43 mV; model amplitude on av-\nerage 6% less than recorded value). In contrast, in gregarious\nlocusts, there were considerable differences between the model\nvalue (1.2 \u0004 0.43 mV) and actual value (1.8 \u0004 0.74 mV; model\nprediction on average 33% less than recorded values). A\nrepeated-measures ANOVA comparing the mean expected and\nrecorded amplitudes for each value of l\/|v| for each animal indi-\ncated that there were significant differences between the pre-\ndicted and measured maximum amplitudes (F(1, 64)\u0007 12.7; p\u0001\n0.001), as well as a significant interaction with phase (F(1, 64) \u0007\n9.1; p \u0007 0.004), but no interaction with l\/|v| (F(4, 64) \u0007 1.9; p\n\u00070.119) (i.e., the accuracy of themodel did not change according\nto the size and\/or velocity of the stimulus) (Fig. 6,C andD, shows\nthe scatter of the data). Analyzing each phase separately suggested\nthat the difference in recorded and model maximum amplitudes\nwas entirely attributable to the gregarious locusts (F(1, 31)\u0007 13.4;\np \u0001 0.001), with no significant differences between these values\namong solitarious locusts (F(1, 29)\u0007 0.87; p\u0007 0.36).\nThemaximum amplitudes of FETi responses predicted by the\nmodel did not differ with l\/|v| for either phase, which corre-\nsponded to the recorded responses of FETi. The only difference\nbetween the model and recorded data was that the recorded re-\nsponse of FETi in gregarious locusts was consistently greater than\nwould be predicted.\nWe electrically stimulatedDCMD to produce trains of PSPs at\nregular intervals to analyze the possibility that the discrepancy\nbetweenmodel and recorded values could be explained by short-\nterm synaptic plasticity (Fig. 7). Brief (0.05 ms) electrical stimu-\nlation of the cervical connectives produced spikes that were sim-\nilar to those of DCMD and evoked PSPs in FETi that were\nindistinguishable in amplitude from those elicited from visually\nstimulatedDCMD spikes (paired samples t test, t9\u0007\b0.827; p\u0007\n0.43; data taken fromboth phases). The latency between the spike\nevoked by the electrical stimulus in the pro-mesothoracic con-\nnectives and the PSP was also the same as that between visually\nevoked DCMD spikes and the PSP (t9\u0007 1.741; p\u0007 0.116; mean\ndifference between electrically and visually elicited spikes, 0.06\nms). The similarity in PSP latency and amplitude between elec-\ntrically and visually elicited PSPs indicate that both were driven\nbyDCMDonly. Repeated electrical stimulation at 30ms intervals\nevoked a train of PSPs, which showed only a small amount of\nTable 1.

Solitarious locusts\nshowedmuchmore variable levels of facil-\nitation, and indeed one of the five tested\nanimals displayed a marginal depression\nof synaptic strength over the course of the\nstimulus train. The second PSP was only\n5 \u0004 10% greater than the first PSP (t4 \u0007\n1.094; p \u0007 0. 335; not significant) and\nreached a maximum 13.8 \u0004 13.5% in-\ncrease in amplitude by the fourth PSP in\nthe sequence. By the eighth PSP in the se-\nquence, amplitude had begun to decline\nagain (Fig. 7C).\nThe time of maximum response in FETi\nThe time at which the maximum ampli-\ntude of the compound PSP occurred in\nFETi was nonlinearly related to l\/|v| (Fig.\n8A,B), although the time of peak firing in\nDCMD is linear with respect to l\/|v| (Fig.\n3C). In other words, theDCMD-FETi syn-\napse transformed the relationship between\nl\/|v| and the time of maximum firing rate\/\npeak depolarization. Furthermore,\nwhereas therewas no difference in the time\nof peak firing in DCMD between solitari-\nous and gregarious locusts (Fig. 3C), in\nFETi, the timing of maximum PSP ampli-\ntude with respect to l\/|v| differed signifi-\ncantly between phases (Mann\u2013Whitney\ntest comparing the exponential coeffi-\ncients of curveswith the equation y(x)\u0007 y0\n\t a\u0005 e\bbx fitted to the data in Fig. 6A: y0,\nZ \u0007 \b2.1, p \u0007 0.036; a, Z \u0007 \b1.9, p \u0007\n0.059; b, Z \u0007 \b2, p \u0007 0.046; n \u0007 16).

The model of FETi com-\npound PSPs exhibited the same linear re-\nlationship between the time of FETi max-\nimum and l\/|v| as the underlying DCMD\nresponse in both phases. Hence, the gradi-\nents of linear regressions of the time of\nmaximum simulated FETi response\nagainst time of maximum DCMD re-\nsponse did not differ significantly from 1\n(one-sample t test; t16\u0007 1.66; n\u0007 17).\nComparing the predicted time of FETi\nmaximum amplitude from the models\nwith themeasured experimental values re-\nvealed that in gregarious locusts, the max-\nimum FETi response occurred earlier than\nwould be predicted when l\/|v| \u0001 40 ms\n(Fig. 8C\u2013E). Recordings at an expanded\ntime scale (Fig. 8C) show that the time of\nPSP maximum (black arrows) occurred\nwell before the maximum predicted by the\nmodel (gray arrows) in a gregarious locust\nfor stimuli of l\/|v| \u0007 5 or 10 ms. In a soli-\ntarious locust, the recorded PSP maxima\noccurred much closer to the predicted\ntime. Both phases show a near coincident\ntime of PSP maximum for l\/|v| \u0007 40 ms\n(Fig. 8C, bottom pair of recordings). The\ndata from all recordings are shown in Fig-\nure 8, D (all data) and E (medians and in-\nterquartile ranges), with the diagonal lines\nshowing where the measured and pre-\ndicted valueswould be the same. In gregar-\nious locusts, when l\/|v|\u0001 40 ms, the mea-\nsured times of FETi maximum fell\nconsistently below this line, indicating that\nthe peak occurred earlier than predicted\n(Fig. 8D,E, gray symbols) (the mean mea-\nsured time of FETi maximum minus the\npredicted value was 12ms, t test against an\nexpected difference of 0 ms; t34 \u0007 \b2.69;\np \u0007 0.01). When l\/|v| \u0007 40 ms, however,\nthere was no significant difference be-\ntween the measured and predicted values of time of FETi max-\nimum (t18 \u0007 0.63; p \u0007 0.54; mean difference, 0.7 ms). In\ncontrast, in solitarious locusts, most recorded times of FETi\nmaximum amplitude were near those predicted by the model,\nparticularly at lower values of l\/|v| (Fig. 8D,E, black symbols).\nThe mean difference between the measured and predicted\ntimes of maximum FETi response did not differ significantly\nfrom zero for any value of l\/|v| (by comparison with the gre-\ngarious data above: for l\/|v| \u000140 ms, the mean difference was\n0.04ms, t38\u0007\b0.28,p\u00070.97; for l\/|v|\u000740ms, t27\u00070.97,p\u00070.34).\nAlthough solitarious locusts did not display any systematic shift in\nthe time ofmaximumPSP amplitude in the sameway as gregarious\nlocusts, they exhibited a greater variance in the residual difference\nbetweenmeasured and predicted times of peak amplitude than gre-\ngarious locusts (Fig. 8F) (ANOVA; F(1, 117)\u0007 4.15; p\u0001 0.044). The\ndifferences between measured and predicted values also increased\nsystematically with l\/|v| for both phases (Fig. 8F) (ANOVA;\nF(1, 117)\u0007 6.73; p\u0001 0.011).\nEffect of DCMD habituation on FETi response\nDCMD habituated during repeated stimulation with a looming\nobject of l\/|v|\u0007 20 ms at 1 min intervals (data for peak firing rate\nare shown in Fig. 9A). Habituation was considerably stronger in\nsolitarious phase locusts, in agreement with our previous study\n(Matheson et al., 2004). By the seventh approach (the last stimu-\nlus inwhich all solitarious locusts produced two ormore spikes to\nthe stimulus), peak DCMD firing rate had decreased, on average,\nby 66% in solitarious locusts but only by 34% in gregarious (t test;\nt15\u0007 4.19; p\u0001 0.001). The data were fitted to a simple exponen-\ntial decay curve of the form y(x)\u0007 y0\t a\u0005 e\n\bbx. In solitarious\nlocusts, the asymptote was at 70 spikes s\b1, whereas in gregarious\nlocusts, it was over twice as high, at 157 spikes s\b1 (Fig. 9A).\nThemaximum amplitude of the compound PSP decreased on\nrepeated visual stimulation, in a pattern that was similar to the\nchange in DCMD response (Fig. 9B).

By the seventh approach, the frequency of DCMD spikes\nin solitarious locusts was often so low that the response in FETi\nhad decomposed into a series of individual nonsummating PSPs\n(Fig. 10A), so that the \u201ccompound\u201d response amplitude was sim-\nilar to that of individual PSPs (Fig. 9B, dark gray band). Themean\ncompound PSP amplitude by the seventh approach was 1.16 \u0004\n0.42 mV in gregarious locusts and only 0.72 \u0004 0.33 mV in soli-\ntarious locusts (t test; t15\u0007\b2.404; p\u0007 0.03).\nWhen visual stimuli are repeated at intervals shorter than 1\nmin, DCMD responses of both solitarious and gregarious locusts\nhabituate evenmore strongly, but responses in gregarious locusts\nalways exceed those in solitarious locusts for a given repetition\nrate (data not shown). We have not examined the response of\nFETi to these higher stimulation frequencies.\nThe maximum compound PSP amplitude was constant in\nnonhabituated locusts regardless of phase or l\/|v|, but there was a\nlinear relationship between the decrease in peak DCMD firing\nrate as it habituated and the maximum amplitude of the com-\npound PSP, which differed between phases (Fig. 9C). Linear re-\ngressions were performed on the data for each animal, and the\nresulting gradients were compared between phases. In solitarious\nlocusts, the compound PSP maximum amplitude depended on\nthe firing rate as follows: 0.01 \u0004 0.004 mV\/spikes.s\b1, but in\ngregarious locusts, the gradient was shallower at 0.004 \u0004 0.004\nmV\/spikes.s\b1. The reduction in the frequency of DCMD spikes\nduring habituation therefore had a stronger effect on compound\nPSP amplitude in solitarious locusts than on gregarious locusts (t\ntest; t15\u0007 15.0; p\u0007 0.005). The amplitudes of single PSPs elicited\nby the first DCMDspike of each stimulus remained the same over\nthe course of the habituation experiments and showed no evi-\ndence of themselves habituating (ANOVA; F(9, 145) \u0007 0.75; p \u0007\n0.63).\nThe DCMD spike trains obtained during the habituation ex-\nperiments were convolved with PSP templates and compared\nbetween phases. As before, the model was scaled to produce volt-\nage values by matching the sizes of the first recorded and simu-\nlated single PSPs. In solitarious locusts (Fig. 10A\u2013C), the model\npredicted smaller maximum compound PSP amplitudes than\nthose recorded in FETi during the first two approaches (model\nprediction, 1.58\u0004 0.47 mV compared with recorded maximum\nof 1.92 \u0004 0.47; a 21% difference). By the third approach, how-\never, the model had converged with the real data (model predic-\ntion, 0.96\u0004 0.53 mV compared with recordedmaximum 1.02\u0004\n0.42 mV; a 6% difference). In gregarious locusts (Fig. 10A\u2013C),\nthere was amuch greater disparity between themaximum ampli-\ntudes predicted by themodel and the largermeasured values over\nthe entire series of approaches. During the first approach, there\nwas a 52% difference between the predicted and the recorded\nmaximum amplitudes (1.13 \u0004 0.45 against 1.73 \u0004 0.53 mV).\nEven by the seventh approach, the difference between predicted\nand observed values was still 45% (0.80 \u0004 0.32 compared with\n1.16\u0004 0.42 mV). There was no evidence that observed and pre-\ndicted maximum compound PSP amplitude values would have\nconverged with further visual stimulation, because the asymp-\ntotes of the curves fitted in Figure 10B were 1.11 mV for the\nmeasured data and 0.74 mV for the model data, indicating a\nconsistent 50% difference. We conclude that the facilitation of\nthe DCMD-FETi synapse that occurs in gregarious locusts does\nnot itself habituate.\nThe time of the peak DCMD firing rate relative to collision\nbecame more variable as DCMD habituated and was therefore\nmore likely to occur earlier in the approach (data not shown).\nThis tendency was particularly marked in solitarious locusts, as\nreported previously by Matheson et al. (2004). This in turn af-\nfected the time of the maximum amplitude of the compound\nPSP, but there was no evidence for any other systematic change in\nthe time of PSPmaximumamplitude that did not derive from the\nunderlying variability in DCMD (ANOVA on the magnitude of\nthe residuals of regressions of time of FETi maximum against\nGregarious\nSolitarious\n1st PSP\n4th PSP\nSolitarious Gregarious\n0.2mV\n20ms\nPSP number\n2 4 6 8 10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nB\nC\n%\nin\ncr\nea\nse\nin\nP\nS\nP\nam\npl\nitu\nde\nFigure 7.

The response of DCMD\nchanges with the size or speed of looming\nstimuli and was less sensitive in solitarious\nlocusts than gregarious locusts (33\u201340%\nlower peak firing rates and 30\u201370% fewer\nspikes), but the single PSPs elicited in soli-\ntarious FETi were twice the amplitude of\nthose in gregarious locusts. Looming stim-\nuli, however, elicited compound PSPs in\nFETi that had the same amplitude in both\nphases regardless of the velocity or size of\nthe stimulus. The timing of the compound\nPSP maximum in FETi was nonlinearly\nadvanced relative to that predicted by the\nresponse of DCMD, particularly so in gre-\ngarious locusts. In the present study, re-\nsponses were only elicited after 8\u201310 min\nintervals, ensuring that DCMD was in a\nfully dishabituated state, whereas previ-\nously (Matheson et al., 2004), stimuli were\npresented at 1 min intervals, leading to\npartial DCMD habituation particularly in\nsolitarious locusts.\nPrevious studies of homeostatic plas-\nticity have primarily followed the conse-\nquences of experimentally imposed dis-\nruptions of neuronal function. For\nexample, genetic manipulation (Davis et\nal., 1997; Sandrock et al., 1997; Davis and\nGoodman, 1998; Guan et al., 2005), phys-\nical isolation of parts of the nervous system\n(Turrigiano et al., 1995; Thoby-Brisson\nand Simmers, 1998), pharmacological\ntreatments (Berg and Hall, 1975; Ramak-\ners et al., 1990; Turrigiano et al., 1998), or\nsensory deprivation during development\n(Desai et al., 2002). Only the scaling of synaptic inputs over the\ncourse of normal postnatal development shows a similar natu-\nrally occurring homeostatic plasticity (Desai et al., 2002). Bucher\net al. (2005) demonstrate that there is homeostatic regulation of\nwhole-network function over a developmental timescale in the\nlobster pyloric network but do not identify the specific underly-\ning homeostatic processes.\nHomeostatic plasticity may lead to altered signaling costs,\nas shown by robustness in neuronal signaling in the face of the\nloss of a delayed rectifier potassium channel in Drosophila\nphotoreceptors (Vahasoyrinki et al., 2006). Because the cost of\npropagating action potentials is generally greater than the cost\nof synaptic transmission (Laughlin et al., 1998), the DCMD-\nFETi pathway is likely to require less energy in solitarious\nlocusts. This would occur at the cost of a coarser and less\nprecise temporal tuning of peak activity in DCMD (Matheson\net al., 2004). If this pattern were repeated throughout the CNS,\nit could translate into a considerably reduced metabolic oper-\nating cost in solitarious locusts, which are less active, show\nreduced adipokinetic responses, and presumably have lower\nmetabolic rates than gregarious locusts (Pener, 1991; Pener et\nal., 1997). The homeostatic plasticity in the DCMD-FETi\npathway of locusts may compensate for changes in neuronal\nexcitability, resulting from widespread phase-related changes\nin the CNS levels of many neurochemicals (Rogers et al.,\n2004).

This tuning may\nadapt the locust to the different behavioral requirements of\neach phase.\nThree components of homeostatic\nplasticity at the FETi-DCMD synapse\nCompound PSPs modeled by convolving\nexperimentally constrained PSP templates\nwith DCMD spike trains matched the\nmeasured values well in solitarious locusts\nbut underestimated them by 33% in gre-\ngarious locusts. The greater maximum fir-\ning frequency of DCMD in gregarious lo-\ncusts only partially offset the decreased size\nof individual PSPs, and thus a third pro-\ncess must be involved in regulating the\nmaximum amplitude of the compound\nPSP between phases. The disparity in am-\nplitude increased progressively over the\ncourse of the stimulus. A non-DCMD syn-\naptic input to FETi, such as from a synap-\ntic input fromother visual interneurons or\nfrom indirect feedforward inputs from\nDCMD, would have to produce a smooth,\nslowly rising depolarization in FETi over a\nlong period (\u0002200 ms). Our electrical\nstimulation data show that the difference\ncan be accounted for by facilitation of the\nDCMD-FETi synapse during repeated\nDCMD spiking in gregarious locusts,\nwhich was not accounted for in themodel.\nSuch short-term synaptic plasticity is well\ndocumented in insects (Burrows et al.,\n1989; Parker, 1995; Niven and Burrows,\n2003). In solitarious locusts, the similarity\nbetween predicted and measured com-\npound PSP amplitudes suggests that there\nwas little facilitation during looming stim-\nuli, in accordance with our electrical stim-\nulation experimental data. In summary,\nthe constancy of the overall drive onto\nFETi during a looming stimulus arises\nfrom homeostatically balanced contribu-\ntions from DCMD firing rates, synaptic\nstrength, and a third process, short-term\nsynaptic plasticity\nLGMD-DCMD displays a linear rela-\ntionship between the time of peak firing\nfrequency relative to collision and the size\/\nvelocity (l\/|v|) of an approaching object\n(Hatsopoulos et al., 1995; Gabbiani et al.,\n1999, 2001, 2002) that is invariant between\nlocust phases (Matheson et al., 2004). This\nrelationship was transformed by the\nDCMD-FETi synapse so that there was a\nnonlinear relationship between l\/|v| and\nthe time of maximum PSP amplitude, and\na clear difference between solitarious and\ngregarious locusts. In solitarious locusts,\nthe nonlinearity was small, but in gregari-\nous locusts, it was much greater so that the\ntime of peak depolarization occurred\nmarkedly earlier for smaller values of l\/|v| .\nTo achieve this synaptic facilitation earlier in the response would\nhave to be followed by synaptic depression (Markram et al., 1998;\nThomson, 2000) or intermittent failure.

At the DCMD-FETi syn-\napse, such an interaction may shape the time at which the com-\npound PSPmaximum occurs. The same process may also reduce\nvariability in the time of peak depolarization. When stimulated\nby a looming object, DCMD produces a burst of spikes with an\nescalating frequency, but it can occasionally produce short high-\nfrequency bursts earlier in the approach. Synaptic facilitation will\ntend to filter out earlier fluctuations in the firing rate of DCMD\n(when evoked PSPs are small) and emphasize the later sustained\nhigh-frequency spikes (when the largest individual PSP are\nevoked). This may act to counteract noise in the sensory signal\n(Krahe and Gabbiani, 2004) and variation in the measured time\nof peak FETi response amplitude relative to that predicted by the\nmodel was less in gregarious than in solitarious locusts. In soli-\ntarious locusts, there was less synaptic facilitation and possibly\ndepression and fewer DCMD spikes so that the time of peak\ncompound PSP amplitude wasmore variable, potentiallymaking\nthe behavioral response more unpredictable to predators. Deter-\nmining the full relationship between DCMD firing rate and FETi\nsynaptic plasticity, and thus establishing the balance between fa-\ncilitation and depression, will be an important step in fully un-\nderstanding the shaping of the response to looming stimuli.\nBehavioral consequences\nThe amplitude of the compound PSP produced by DCMD in\nFETi was always below spiking threshold in both phases and thus\ncould not initiate a behavioral response in the absence of another\nsynaptic drive. Jumping in locusts requires a complexmotor pat-\ntern (Heitler and Burrows, 1977a,b; Burrows, 1995; Santer et al.,\n2005b) with energy stored in elastic elements in the leg during a\nprolonged cocontraction between extensor and flexor tibiae\nmuscles. This process is aided by a monosynaptic excitatory con-\nnection between FETi and the flexor tibiae motoneurons (Hoyle\nand Burrows, 1973; Niven and Burrows, 2003). A jump is trig-\ngered when the flexor tibiae motoneurons stop firing, allowing\nrapid extension of the tibia. This entire process takes several hun-\ndred milliseconds, and thus DCMD can have little role in initiat-\ning the process if escape is to precede collision. DCMD could,\nhowever, have a significant function in an already cocontracting\nanimal by adding to the excitation in FETi, controlling the timing\nof kick release (Niven and Burrows, 2003), or by possibly provid-\ning a shunting inhibition to the FETi-flexor synapses that would\nassist in releasing a kick. Our data suggest that the strength of any\nsuch effects will be the same in both phases, although the timing\nat which they occur will differ.\nThe visual environment of gregarious locusts is, by definition,\ndominated by the presence of other locusts, which provide a con-\nstant source of small fast-moving objects (small l\/|v|). Gregarious\nlocusts are more visible to predators than cryptic solitarious\nlocusts, but once detected, they are protected by numbers. Dif-\nferences in the sensory-motor pathway fromDCMDprovide gre-\ngarious locusts with an earlier and more temporally consistent\nresponse to approaching objects, mostly other locusts, but give\nsolitarious locusts amore variable later-acting escape response to\npredators.\nReferences\nBerg DK, Hall ZW (1975) Increased extrajunctional acetylcholine sensitiv-\nity produced by chronic post-synaptic neuromuscular blockade.
