INTRODUCTION \n \nThe traditional role of fisheries scientists has been to estimate the size of fish \nstocks and predict their dynamic response to harvesting or, conversely, to identify \nacceptable harvesting strategies. The population dynamic models used in these tasks \ngenerally describe only the harvested species and do not account for their interactions \nwith the wider ecosystem. This approach is partly responsible for the widespread \nfailure to maintain the desired abundance of fish stocks (Hutchings, 1996), to prevent \nfishing operations from damaging other parts of the ecosystem (Turner et al., 1999), \nand to control the impact of other human activities on fisheries (Bruton, 1995). It is \nnow widely acknowledged that fisheries must be managed in a way that recognises \ntheir interdependence with the wider ecosystem. The 2002 World Summit on \nSustainable Development called for this \u201cecosystem approach to fisheries\u201d to be \nimplemented in all fisheries by 2010.  \nAvailable definitions of the ecosystem approach are generally wide-ranging, \nrecognising the socio-economic and ecological effects of fisheries and allied \nindustries, and their interactions with other human activities (Garcia et al., 2003). \nFishing affects other parts of the marine food-web in various ways including the direct \nremoval of non-target species (technical interactions) and more complex indirect \neffects propagated by biological interactions such as predation and competition. The \necosystem approach to fisheries will therefore need reliable models that incorporate \nthese interactions to predict the ecosystem effects of harvesting and to identify \nmanagement strategies that balance the conflicting requirements of harvesting and \nconservation. Several authors have discussed the role of modelling in this context \n(Hollowed et al., 2000; Fulton, Smith & Johnson, 2003; Butterworth & Plag\u00e1nyi, \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 5\n2004; deYoung et al., 2004; Christensen & Walters, 2004). Models that incorporate \nfood-web interactions, particularly multi-species virtual population analysis (MSVPA; \nSparre, 1991) have been used in the assessment of commercially harvested fish \nstocks, but no models predicting the population dynamics of multiple interacting \nspecies are currently used in fisheries management (but see Livingston et al., 2005). \nDespite the shortage of models, the management of some fisheries already \ntakes account of known food-web interactions. For example, some species of seabirds \nare strongly dependent on the local availability of sandeels (family Ammodytidae), \nespecially during the breeding season. The management of North Sea sandeel \nfisheries acknowledges this dependency in a decision rule that suspends fishing within \n50 km of the UK North Sea coast if the breeding performance of kittiwakes, Rissa \ntridactyla, falls below a specified threshold for three consecutive years. The \nmanagement of Alaskan pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, and mackerel, \nPleurogrammus monopterygius, fisheries uses spatial and seasonal catch limits to \nminimise competition with Steller sealions, Eumetopias jubatus, and prohibits \ndirected fishing for several forage species that are important prey for higher trophic \nlevels (Witherell, Pautzke & Fluharty, 2000). The principle of controlling the food-\nweb effects of fisheries is also incorporated into the Convention on the Conservation \nof Antarctic Marine Living Resources (which we will subsequently refer to as \u201cthe \nConvention\u201d) which established the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic \nMarine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to manage Southern Ocean fisheries. \nThe Convention came into force in 1982, after almost two centuries of over-\nexploitation of Southern Ocean marine resources. This began with the near-\nextermination of Antarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus gazella, stocks in the 18th and 19th \nCenturies, followed by the great whales in the 20th Century and many fish stocks in \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 6\nthe 1970-80s. From the late 1970s, catches of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, \nhave exceeded those of all other species in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic krill is also \nthe main prey of charismatic taxa including baleen whales, penguins and seals, and an \nimportant prey species for some albatrosses. Consequently, one of CCAMLR\u2019s \npriorities has been to develop an operational management approach for the krill \nfishery. According to Sainsbury, Punt & Smith (2000), this is currently the most \nadvanced management approach in terms of its treatment of food-web interactions. \nCCAMLR attempts to manage the krill stock so that its biomass will not fall below a \nlevel considered appropriate to meet the food requirements of other species in the \nfood-web. Although this level is precautionary, it is also arbitrary and the potential \neffects of the fishery on these other species are not known. \nCurrent krill catches are around 3% of the annual catch limit but fishing \npressure is likely to increase greatly in the future (Everson, Agnew & Miller, 2000; \nCroxall & Nicol, 2004).  Consequently, there is a pressing need to assess the likely \nimpacts of the krill fishery on the wider ecosystem, and to determine the suitability of \nthe current management strategy or any potential alternatives. \nSome of the earliest models to explore the ecosystem effects of fishing \nfocused on the Southern Ocean (e.g. May et al., 1979), and numerous studies have \nconsidered food-web interactions involving krill (Sissenwine, 1983; Constable, 2001). \nThese models were largely theoretical but there are several reasons why the krill-\nbased system in the Southern Ocean is also particularly suitable for the development \nof practical models of ecosystem dynamics: (1) this system is relatively simple \ncompared to other marine ecosystems (Everson, 1977) because the dominant primary \nconsumer (krill) is connected to its main consumers through only one or two trophic \nlinks, and most of these consumers are top predators that have fewer trophic \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 7\nconnections than intermediate trophic level species; (2) much work has already been \ndone on developing models of the key species in the food-web, and on their \ninteractions with other species; (3) CCAMLR has made considerable progress in \ntranslating the principle of managing the effects of fisheries on the food-web into \noperational requirements. \nHerein we review the development of conceptual and mathematical models of \nthe krill-based system in order to identify findings and approaches that are likely to be \nuseful in developing practical models for managing fisheries in general and the krill \nfishery in particular. We also propose a framework for developing practical models by \ncombining sub-models of limited parts of the system. In particular we consider how to \nrepresent uncertainty about ecosystem structure and functioning in these models.   \nThe various models that we consider were developed to answer a range of \nquestions, with a range of focal scales and species (Table 1). Many were not designed \nto describe ecosystem interactions in a management context. However we restrict our \nconsideration to aspects of the models that are relevant to describing the ecosystem \neffects of krill harvesting. In the first section we describe general conceptual models \nof the Southern Ocean ecosystem to provide a context for the rest of the review. The \nsecond section considers the population dynamics and distributional characteristics of \nkrill, and how physical processes influence these characteristics. The third section \nconsiders models of the interactions between krill and its predators. The fourth section \nconsiders models of energy and nutrient flow in the food-web, and those models that \nattempt to encapsulate interactions at multiple trophic levels. The fifth section \npresents models used for assessing krill yield or for modelling the dynamics of the \nkrill fishery. Finally we consider the development of practical models of exploited \nmarine systems, including how to deal with complexity and uncertainty. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 8\n \n \nII. THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ECOSYSTEM \n \n   \n(1) The physical environment \n \nThe Southern Ocean is a major marine system, entirely surrounding the \nAntarctic continent (Fig. 1). The Subtropical Front, which is characterised by steep \ngradients in sea surface temperature and salinity, separates the Southern Ocean from \nthe subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.  Further south, \nstrong westerly winds drive the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current \n(ACC), which incorporates a number of fronts. Amongst these, the Antarctic Polar \nFront is recognised as an important physical and biological boundary and its mean \nposition approximately defines the northern limit of the CCAMLR area. This \ncontrasts with the arbitrary, political boundary (60\u00baS) of the Antarctic Treaty area. \nAlthough the various fronts limit biological exchange between the Southern Ocean \nand the adjoining oceans, birds (Croxall et al., 2005), marine mammals (Best & \nSchell, 1996) and some fish (Mikheev, 1965) migrate across them. The planktonic \nlarvae of some invertebrates also survive transport across these fronts, challenging the \nnotion of an isolated Southern-Ocean ecosystem (Clarke, Barnes & Hodgson, 2005). \nThe Southern Ocean also exchanges waters with the adjoining oceans, and is \nparticularly important in global thermohaline circulation as it connects to three other \noceans and cold, deep waters form in the Ross and Weddell seas. South of the ACC, \nthe subpolar regime is characterised by a westward current that combines with large \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 9\ncyclonic gyres in these seas and a smaller gyre near Prydz Bay. A detailed assessment \nof these fronts and currents is given in Orsi, Whitworth & Nowlin (1995). \nClose to the Antarctic Polar Front, the Southern Ocean is between 3000 and \n5000 m deep. It gradually shelves towards the Antarctic continental slope, but \nincludes major topographic features such as the mainly submarine Scotia Ridge which \nruns from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia, and the platforms occupied by \nKerguelen and Heard Islands, and the Crozet and Prince Edward Islands. The \nAntarctic continental shelf is unusually deep, at between 400 and 800 m, due to the \nweight of the continental ice sheets. The Weddell and Ross Seas are wide bights, but \notherwise the shelf is rarely more than 100 km wide. It is especially narrow on the \nwestern edge of the Antarctic Peninsula. \nThe Southern Ocean ecosystem is also influenced by the large-scale presence \nof ice, including permanent ice shelves close to the continent, and the seasonal \nadvance and retreat of sea-ice further north. Ice cover provides a barrier between \natmospheric and oceanographic processes, while melt water from retreating sea-ice \naffects the saline and thermal stratification of the ocean (Gordon, 1988).   \n \n \n(2) Biogeography \n \nThere is considerable spatial heterogeneity in the Southern Ocean, and various authors \nhave proposed schemes for subdividing the Ocean into zones based on physical or \nbiological characteristics (Hart, 1942; Voronina, 1971; Longhurst, 1998). There is \ngeneral agreement that the region can be divided into a permanently open ocean zone \nto the north, a seasonal sea-ice zone in which the annual advance and retreat of sea-ice \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 10\noccurs, and a coastal and continental shelf zone in which permanent ice shelves occur  \n(Hempel, 1985; Arrigo et al., 1998; Longhurst, 1998).  However, the relationship \nbetween these zones and the distribution and abundance of krill and its dependent \nspecies varies throughout the Southern Ocean, suggesting that models should capture \nlocal characteristics rather than attempting to generalise within these zones. For \nexample, krill and its consumers are mostly absent from the permanently open ocean \nzone. However, around South Georgia a combination of high levels of krill import on \nocean currents and high biological productivity, resulting from complex \noceanography and possible local enhancement of nutrient flows, maintain some of the \nhighest concentrations of both krill and its predators (Atkinson et al., 2001).  High \nconcentrations of krill are also found around other subantarctic islands such as the \nPrince Edward Islands (Pakhomov & Froneman, 1999). Productivity is also high in \nthe seasonal sea-ice zone where a series of phytoplankton blooms follow the retreat of \nice in summer and krill is the main macroscopic component of the food-web. \n Although krill represents a visible concentration of biomass in the Southern \nOcean, with an estimated standing stock of 44 million tonnes in the Atlantic sector \nalone (Hewitt et al., 2004a; but see Demer & Conti, 2005), it and its consumers \nconstitute only part of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Indeed, Miller et al. (1985) \nestimated that krill consumed only about 3% of the daily phytoplankton production \nencountered during an extensive survey in summer 1981, while microorganisms \nconsumed most of the remainder. \n \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 11\n \nIII. KRILL MODELS \n \nEffective management of exploited species requires an understanding of their life \nhistory and the factors controlling their population dynamics. For widely distributed \nspecies like Antarctic krill it is also important to understand the factors controlling \ntheir spatial and temporal distribution. This information will also be critical for \npredicting the ecosystem effects of harvesting. In this section we consider models that \nilluminate these issues. Further detail can be found in several complementary reviews \non biological and population parameters  (Sahrhage, 1988; Miller & Hampton, 1989; \nSiegel & Nicol, 2000; Everson, 2000b) and distribution and population dynamics \n(Everson, 2000a; Siegel, 2005).  \n \n \n(1) General characteristics \n \n Antarctic krill is a Euphausid crustacean that can reach a maximum size of \naround 65 mm and has an apparent maximum lifespan of 5-7 years. It has a discrete \nbreeding season in the Antarctic summer, it is a broadcast spawner and its early life is \ncharacterised by a strong descent-ascent cycle. Larvae become juveniles around the \nend of their first year, but do not begin to spawn until their third or fourth year (Ross \n& Quetin, 2000).   \nSiegel & Nicol\u2019s (2000) compilation of parameter estimates illustrates the high \ndegree of spatial and temporal variability in such fundamental characteristics as the \nrate of natural mortality, maximum age and growth rate.  Models that incorporate \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 12\nnatural variability have generally succeeded in replicating observed patterns of size \nstructure. For example, Murphy & Reid (2001) reproduced monthly changes in the \nsize distribution of krill at South Georgia using a model that incorporated seasonal \nvariability in natural mortality and growth rate. Also, Hofmann & Lascara (2000) \nfound that it was necessary to include a seasonal change in respiration rates in order \nfor their bioenergetic model to replicate observed patterns of growth and shrinkage. \nThe instantaneous growth rate is known to vary with both temperature and food \navailability (e.g. Atkinson et al., 2006), which themselves vary over a range of spatial \nand temporal scales. Spatial differences in growth rate and natural mortality might \nlead to differences in size structure (Reid et al., 2002), with consequences for the \ninterpretation of these data. In particular, attempts to establish the maximum age of \nkrill depend on the decomposition of length-frequency distributions into apparent age \nclasses.  Mackintosh (1974) identified two to three modes in length-frequency \ndistributions for krill at South Georgia whereas Siegel (1987) identified at least five \nmodes in a similar size range of krill from the Antarctic Peninsula region. This \ndiscrepancy is probably due to differences in growth rate rather than differences in the \nmaximum age. \n The complex patterns of variation observed in the biological characteristics of \nAntarctic krill suggest that models of ecosystem dynamics will need to capture this \nspatial and temporal variability. In particular, the spatial scale of models should allow \nadequate representation of variability between areas. It is encouraging that modelling \nstudies have generally been effective in describing patterns of variability, and it is \nlikely that these studies will be useful in identifying appropriate parameter \ndistributions for specific regions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds many \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 13\nof these parameter estimates, due to natural variation, observation error and \nuncertainty about the underlying processes. \n \n \n(2) Distribution and transport \n \nMarr (1962) described the broad-scale distribution of Antarctic krill, which extends \nfrom the Antarctic continental shelf to the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone, with \nheterogeneous but large-scale concentrations of biomass, particularly in the Antarctic \nPeninsula \u2013 Scotia Sea region. Other than confirming the presence of Antarctic krill in \nthe Ross Sea (Sala, Azzali & Russo, 2002), recent studies have not substantially \naltered this view. However, it is now clear that the spatial distribution of krill biomass \ncan vary considerably between years (Atkinson et al., 2004).  \nIn some areas, such as the Scotia Sea, aggregations of krill occur predictably \nin shelf and shelf-break areas (e.g. BIOMASS, 1977; Everson & Goss, 1991; Murphy \net al., 1997; Trathan et al., 1998). They are also often associated with oceanic fronts \nincluding the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) at South \nGeorgia (Witek, Kalinowski & Grelowski, 1988; Miller & Hampton, 1989, Hofmann \net al., 1998; Trathan et al., 2003). Everson (1976, 1977) suggested that enhanced \nprimary productivity in regions of upwelling could be a key factor in krill distribution.  \nBy contrast, Witek, et al. (1988) suggested that behavioural reactions to water \nvelocity gradients tended to concentrate krill in quiescent areas to the side of strong \nflow fields (see also Macaulay, English & Mathisen, 1984) where plankton abundance \nis often high, possibly as a consequence of the stable water conditions. Atkinson et al. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 14\n(2004) have shown that krill abundance in the Southern Ocean is spatially correlated \nwith summer phytoplankton concentrations at a coarse scale. \nThe advection of krill in ocean currents has been the subject of a number of \nmodelling studies.  Models using a predicted circulation field for the Scotia Sea and \nthe output from the Fine Resolution Antarctic Model (Webb et al., 1991) show that \npassive transport could carry krill from the West Antarctic Peninsula region across to \nSouth Georgia in about three to four months (Hofmann et al., 1998; Murphy et al., \n1998).  Hofmann et al. (1998) indicated that Ekman drift concentrates particles in the \nSACCF, and concluded that the southern portion of the ACC is the primary \nmechanism transporting krill from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia. Murphy \net al. (1998) also considered the effects of sea-ice variation and showed that winter \nsea-ice sometimes covers the main transport pathways and therefore potentially \naffects the wider distribution of krill. \nFach, Hofmann & Murphy (2002) used estimated food availability from \nCoastal Zone Colour Scanner data, along with ocean temperature data, to estimate the \ngrowth of krill when transported in the ACC in the Southwest Atlantic.  They found \nthat the winter open ocean concentrations of phytoplankton were unlikely to provide \nsufficient food to maintain the krill as they travel from the Antarctic Peninsula region \nto South Georgia.  The analyses also showed that the tracks of krill across the region \ncoincide with the advancing ice-edge, suggesting that sea-ice algae could provide an \nalternative food-source during transport in winter. \nMore recently Murphy et al. (2004a) have examined the origin and fate of krill \nin the Scotia Sea using Lagrangian particle tracking and the output from the OCCAM \ncirculation and climate model (Saunders, Coward & De Cuevas, 1999).  The results \nshowed that passive transport would have carried particles into areas of high biomass \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 15\nobserved during extensive surveys in summer 2000.  They also indicated that much of \nthe biomass of krill observed across the Scotia Sea, including the South Georgia \nregion, during the summer would have been associated with the winter sea-ice less \nthan two to three months previously.  The young krill that emerge from under the sea-\nice during spring could have originated in a wide range of possible areas in the \nnorthern Weddell Sea and southern Scotia Arc region, and both the East and West \nAntarctic Peninsula. Particles that occurred in eastern regions of the central Scotia Sea \nwere transported east around the north of the South Sandwich Islands, while particles \nthat occurred slightly further east would pass around South Georgia.  Although this \nstudy suggests transport trajectories for a specific period, Thorpe et al. (2002) have \nshown that temporal and spatial variability in ocean circulation will cause variation in \nthe transport trajectories of particles in the Scotia Sea. \nHuntley & Niiler (1995) argue that, because the life cycle of Antarctic krill is \nrelatively long and advective features change over relatively small spatial scales, \nlarge-scale dispersion of larval cohorts is likely to be common. Consequently it might \nbe appropriate to think of krill as forming temporary aggregations dictated by \nadvective processes rather than self-sustaining populations at regional scales. \nNevertheless, it is clear that adult krill are able to maintain discrete aggregations \ndespite advection. Krill are able to modify their distribution locally by swimming, \nwhich will affect retention processes in shelf areas (Murphy, 1995; Murphy et al., \n2004b).  Vertical migration will modify the pathways of transport and, as Hardy \n(1956) suggested, this will be important in some regions of complex circulation \n(Murphy et al., 2004a).  There is, however, no evidence that krill undertake directed \nlarge-scale migrations (Marr, 1962).   \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 16\nThe structure of krill stocks is a particularly important consideration for \nfisheries management. There have been a number of genetic studies, which have \nfound no evidence for discrete stocks (Siegel, 2005). This supports the idea of a \ncontinuous exchange of genetic material throughout the Southern Ocean. CCAMLR \nhas pragmatically restricted its synoptic surveys of krill biomass to the Southwest \nAtlantic sector, where biomass and fishing activity are strongly concentrated. \nHowever, there are gaps in our understanding of the interdependence between krill \npopulations both within this area and throughout the Southern Ocean. \nThe distribution of krill is complex and heterogeneous as a result of \ninteractions between advection and krill behaviour, which vary over both time and \nspace (Murphy et al., 2004a). Large-scale numerical ocean models do not resolve well \nthe sub-mesoscale processes that will be important for understanding the behavioural \ninteractions of krill with ocean currents and eddies. Therefore the development of \nhigh-resolution shelf models is a high priority, especially for areas with high krill \nconcentrations. There is a also a need to incorporate krill behaviour into these models. \nNonetheless, existing models highlight the importance of advection and suggest upper \nbounds for its influence on krill distribution. \n \n \n(3) Population dynamics and recruitment \n \n No relationship between adult stock size and recruitment success has been \nfound for Antarctic krill (Siegel & Loeb, 1995). Rather, various empirical and \nmodelling studies have suggested that recruitment success might be linked to physical \nenvironmental factors.  \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 17\nThe models of Hofmann et al. (1992) and Hofmann & H\u00f9srev\u00f5glu (2003) \nfocused on mechanisms that might affect the successful recruitment of young krill to \nthe adult population.  Krill eggs are released in the upper water column, from where \nthey sink and hatch at depth. The larvae then swim back to the surface to feed. In the \nmodels, the sinking rate was governed by water density, and the development and \nascent rate of embryos and larvae were governed by temperature (Hofmann et al., \n1992).  With data inputs of water temperature and density, and bottom topography, \nthe model indicated that, on the continental shelf, successful completion of the \ndescent-ascent cycle will occur only in limited areas that are sufficiently deep and \nwhere warm Circumpolar Deep Water penetrates onto the shelf at depth  (Hofmann & \nH\u00f9srev\u00f5glu, 2003).  \nTemporal variability in krill recruitment has been linked to various \nenvironmental influences (see Miller & Hampton, 1989; Sahrhage, 1988; Constable, \nNicol & Strutton, 2003 for reviews), especially the presence of sea-ice, which is \nthought to provide a feeding habitat for larval krill (Kawaguchi & Satake, 1994; Loeb \net al., 1997; Fraser & Hofmann, 2003). These studies analysed the relationship \nbetween recruitment, adult distribution and seasonal sea-ice extent, suggesting that \ngreater numbers of small krill enter the adult population after winters with extensive \nsea-ice coverage. After analysing seven decades of net haul data Atkinson et al. \n(2004) concluded that krill abundance in the Southwest Atlantic was correlated with \nwinter sea-ice extent, and that krill abundance has declined progressively since the \n1970s. Loeb et al. (1997) also found that the frequency of high krill population \ndensities near the Antarctic Peninsula had declined since the mid-1970s, and there had \nbeen a decline in the frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice over five decades. \nHowever, despite the relationships in the Scotia Sea area, Constable et al. (2003) \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 18\nfound no environmental factors that were reliable covariates of recruitment, \ndistribution or abundance at the Southern Ocean scale. This might be partly because \nrecruitment indices are difficult to derive and are therefore potentially inconsistent \nbetween studies and regions. \nRecent analyses of physical variability in sea-ice and oceanography (Murphy \net al., 1995; Fedulov, Murphy & Shulgovsky, 1996; White & Peterson, 1996; \nNaganobu et al., 1999; Trathan & Murphy, 2002) have suggested links between large-\nscale atmospheric processes (indicated by the Southern Oscillation Index) and factors \naffecting variability in krill populations  (Siegel & Loeb, 1995; Murphy et al., 1998; \nConstable et al., 2003; Trathan et al., 2003). Constable et al. (2003) explored ways in \nwhich the physical system can affect primary and secondary productivity.  They found \nthat a loss of sea-ice over the last two decades might result in greater recruitment \nvariability and lower abundance of krill in the Southwest Atlantic whereas recruitment \nmight have been much less variable before the 1980s. \nInter-annual variability in recruitment success might also be an important \nfactor determining the size structure of krill populations.  Murphy & Reid (2001) \nmodelled population structure using revised estimates of key demographic parameters \n(Miller & Hampton, 1989; Pakhomov, 1995) and found that observed inter-annual \nchanges in length-frequency distribution at South Georgia were consistent with a \nreduction in biomass associated with the failure of a single year class to recruit into \nthe population.  \n Most of the detailed analysis of krill population dynamics has focused on the \nSouthwest Atlantic, where large inter-annual variations in abundance have been \nobserved (e.g. Sushin & Shulgovsky, 1999). Brierley et al. (1999) found that inter-\nannual changes in abundance at South Georgia mirrored those at Elephant Island, \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 19\nsuggesting large-scale connections between the krill found throughout the Scotia Sea. \nRecent work examining krill in the diets of predators at South Georgia, the Antarctic \nPeninsula, South Orkney and South Shetland Islands also suggests large-scale \nconcordance in the population dynamics of krill in this region (Reid et al. 2002; \nFraser & Hofmann, 2003; Lynnes, Reid & Croxall, 2004; Osman et al., 2004). \n These studies have identified some useful empirical and process models that \nmay be helpful in predicting krill recruitment, which is of fundamental importance in \nthe dynamics of the ecosystem. However there is a great deal of variability in this \nprocess and no definitive predictive model. These studies suggest that recruitment is \nlargely independent of the adult population size but might be autocorrelated and \nlinked to environmental factors in some regions. Recruitment could therefore be \nmodelled as a stochastic process that includes autocorrelation or is informed by \nenvironmental factors. Logically, there will be some threshold adult population size \nbelow which krill recruitment is affected. The current krill management strategy \nrecognises this and attempts to control the risk of the population size falling below an \narbitrary level. \n  \n \nIV. PREDATOR-PREY MODELS \n \nModels of the interactions linking exploited species to other species will be needed to \nmanage the impact of fisheries on other parts of the food-web. The population \ndynamics of many Southern Ocean species have shown dramatic changes, many of \nwhich are directly linked to harvesting, especially in the Southwest Atlantic sector.  \nThere have been major declines in the populations of baleen whales (Laws, 1977) and \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 20\nAntarctic fur seals. Fur seals were apparently completely absent from South Georgia \nfollowing the harvest of more than a million animals in the 1800s. However, the fur \nseal population increased from tens of animals in the 1930s to hundreds in the 1950s \n(Bonner, 1964) to an estimated 1.5 million in 1991 when the rate of population \nincrease was still around 10% per year (Boyd, 1993). There have also been major \ndeclines in the populations of other seal and fish species. For example, the catch of the \nfish Notothenia rossii around South Georgia reportedly exceeded 500,000 tonnes in \njust two seasons between 1969 and 1971, but since then the estimated stock size has \nremained below 10% of this catch (Kock, 1992, but see Kock, Belchier & Jones \n2004). \n An early attempt to relate these dynamics to interactions between species was \nprovided by Laws (1977) who calculated that the depletion of baleen whale stocks, \nfrom an estimated 43 million tonnes before 1930 to 7 million tonnes in the early \n1970s, reduced krill consumption by 147 million tonnes per year. He also suggested \nthat krill consumption by the remaining whales and other predators, including fur \nseals and various penguin species, might have increased as populations of these other \npredators were expanding. However, indicators of population size for predators at \nSouth Georgia showed a declining trend in the 1990s, suggesting that any \u2018surplus\u2019 \nkrill required to sustain population increases was no longer available (Reid & Croxall, \n2001).  \nOn the basis that Laws\u2019 (1977) estimate of the reduction in krill consumption \nby baleen whales exceeds the maximum recorded annual catch of global marine \nfisheries, Mori & Butterworth (2004) argue that this represents the biggest man-made \nperturbation of any marine ecosystem. Although the impacts of harvesting on target \nspecies and their prey are not directly comparable, the argument that this represents an \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 21\nenormous perturbation remains valid. Subsequent attempts to model the dynamics of \ninteracting populations in the Southern Ocean have also had an important, though \nsometimes controversial (Yodzis, 1994), impact. Early models were largely \ntheoretical abstractions, exploring the implications of harvesting interacting species. \nMore recent models have explored specific influences on these interactions, and have \nalso attempted to reconstruct the historical dynamics of some species and to establish \nthe krill requirements of predators. Details of selected predator-prey models are given \nin Table 2. \n \n \n(1) Early models of long-term dynamics \n \nThe early models of long-term dynamics  (May et al., 1979; Beddington & \nMay, 1980; Horwood, 1981; Beddington & Cooke, 1982; Yamanaka, 1983) generally \nassumed logistic population growth in individual populations, but with predation \nsubtracted from the prey population, and carrying capacity for the predator population \ndetermined by the abundance of its prey. The equations were coupled to represent \nsimple predator-prey interactions. Variations included competition amongst predators \nand interactions at three trophic levels (May et al., 1979; Horwood, 1981; Yamanaka, \n1983). These models generally assumed a steady-state environment and therefore had \nequilibrium solutions. Perturbation due to harvesting moves these model systems \naway from equilibrium and their rate of recovery after harvesting is dependent on the \nmodel structure and parameterisation, particularly the intrinsic rates of population \nincrease.   \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 22\nWhile May et al. (1979) and Horwood (1981) used a linear functional \nresponse to describe prey consumption per predator, Yamanaka (1983, see description \nin Shimadzu, 1985) used an asymptotic function, representing the likely saturation of \npredation rate at high levels of prey abundance. He concluded that future harvesting \nof krill would reduce seal populations but that whales would recover in the long term, \neven with krill catches of around 100 million tonnes per year. He also considered \nsome stochastic variability in the carrying capacity of krill, which would mask short-\nterm population trends in krill.  \nThe analysis of May et al. (1979) was instrumental in demonstrating the \npotential impact of harvesting one species on other parts of the food-web and, \ntherefore, the limitations of single-species management. However, such models were \nnever intended as realistic descriptions of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The \nformulation of these models means that predator populations essentially follow \nchanges in the prey population with some time lag, unless the predator population is \nartificially constrained through harvesting. When harvesting stops, these model \nsystems return to a single (non-trivial) equilibrium. However, real systems and more \ncomplex models might have multiple potential equilibria (e.g. Harrison, 1986; \nKnowlton, 2004). Indeed, May et al. (1979) suggested that the Southern Ocean might \nbe adjusting to new equilibria following the depletion of baleen whale populations.  \nAmongst the simplifications in the May et al. (1979) model is the assumption \nof a linear functional response, which, as Yodzis (1994) illustrates, is not biologically \nplausible and potentially exaggerates the impact of marine mammals on the standing \nstock of krill. Also, the simulated krill populations were governed solely by the so-\ncalled top-down effects of predation. However, there is now considerable evidence \nthat environmental influences on recruitment can lead to changes in krill abundance, \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 23\nindependently of predation. Also, realistic models must incorporate adequate \nrepresentations of uncertainty and natural variability that are not captured in these \ndeterministic models. The quantitative results of these simplistic models should not be \nregarded as reliable descriptions of the real system. Despite these limitations, these \nstudies have provided valuable insights into the way harvested systems could behave. \nIn particular, that any krill surplus caused by the depletion of baleen whales would be \nshort-lived because it would allow the expansion of other, faster-growing, predator \npopulations.  \n \n \n(2) Recent models of predator-prey dynamics \n \n More recent models of predator-prey interactions in the Southern Ocean have \ngenerally focused on predator dynamics. These models have used more detailed \nrepresentations of the predator population and, often, the krill population than Lokta-\nVolterra-type models. In particular, these models have addressed the influence of \nspatial structure in krill distribution and krill harvest levels on predator populations, \nand the long-term dynamics of baleen whales. \nMurphy (1995) modelled the response of predator populations to the input of \nkrill into their foraging area. The model was divided into a number of spatial regions \nwith characteristic krill input and output rates. Predator population dynamics were \nrepresented with a logistic function as in May et al. (1979), but different predators had \ndifferent foraging radii from land and those with larger radii had greatest access to the \nkrill as it was transported towards an island. In this scenario, the removal of whales or \nseals, which had greater access to the krill population, could release prey for those \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 24\npredators with more limited access. The form and degree of local retention could \namplify the effects of changing krill abundance on predator populations.  \nMurphy\u2019s (1995) study also considered the spatial demand for prey by \npredators at South Georgia and integrated the available data to estimate demand as a \nfunction of distance from a central predator colony. This was used to calculate the \nretention of krill required to meet this demand. The results indicated that retention had \nto be high, and krill transport slow, within 175 km of the colony, with maximum \nretention and slowest transport around 125 km from the land. This approximately \ncorresponds to the shelf-break areas.   \nThis model illustrates the potential influence of the spatial structure of the \nenvironment and the behaviour of individual species on interspecific competition and \ntherefore population dynamics. This type of model is likely to be useful in \nestablishing potential functional forms for competitive interactions in ecosystem \ndynamics models. However, more detail is required on the distribution and production \nof prey. For example, elaboration of coastal ocean transport would help to determine \nwhat mechanisms might contribute to concentrating or retaining krill in shelf-break \nareas. \nButterworth & Thomson (1995) modelled the impacts of krill fishing on krill \npredators. Their aim was to establish krill yields that would prevent the depletion of \npredator populations below reference levels. The predator model considered only \nreproductively mature females and had separate terms representing adult survival and \nrecruitment. Recruitment was the product of lagged adult population size and juvenile \nsurvival, adjusted by a density-dependence term. Adult and juvenile survival were \nseparate two-stage functions of krill abundance that were linear up to their \nasymptotes.  For each set of parameters considered, the models predicted a non-linear \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 25\ndecline in the equilibrium predator population with increasing krill yields. The decline \nwas more rapid when prey recruitment was variable than when it was constant. The \nasymptotic limit to the functional response means that declines in population size \nresulting from years of low krill availability are not necessarily compensated for by \nincreases due to years of high availability. Although this model was parameterised \nwith available data, the populations declined even in the absence of fishing, \nsuggesting errors in the empirical estimates of survival rate or their assumed \nrelationship with krill abundance, or other assumptions of the model. \nThomson et al. (2000) refined the approach of Butterworth & Thomson (1995) \nwith a model of the South Georgia population of Antarctic fur seals. The central \nrepresentation of the relationship between krill abundance and predator survival was \nreplaced with a versatile function to allow the exploration of a number of functional \nforms (approximating to Holling types I-III). This function could potentially be \nparameterised for other predators as in the 1995 study.  The effect of harvesting on \nkrill abundance was modelled using stochastic population projections from the \nCCAMLR krill yield model (Butterworth et al., 1994). Krill availability within the \npredators\u2019 foraging range was proportional to the regional abundance with added \nnoise. The female part of the predator population was represented with a partially age-\nstructured model in which offspring survival was a function of carrying capacity. The \nsurvival of each age group (pups, pre-adults and adults) had a functional relationship \nwith krill availability that was parameterised by comparison with empirical survival \ndata, but the shape parameter was assumed.  \nThomson et al. (2000) attempted to correct probable bias in estimates of adult \nsurvival rate, which led to slightly higher survival rates in stochastic than in \ndeterministic versions of the model. As a result, and by contrast with Butterworth & \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 26\nThomson (1995), the negative effects of fishing on the predator population were \ngreater when krill recruitment was constant than when it was variable. The assumed \nmaximum growth rate for the predator population and the shape of the relationship \nbetween krill availability and predator survival were found to produce bias in the \nestimated krill yield for a given target predator population. This might have been due \nto inaccurate representation of the predator's diet. The diet was assumed to be \nexclusively krill but Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia also eat substantial amounts \nof fish (Reid, 1995; Reid & Arnould, 1996). In addition, the relationship between krill \nabundance and availability to predators was assumed to be linear. However, the \nlikelihood of a non-linear relationship between krill abundance and its exploitation \nrate is widely recognised as a potentially important influence on ecosystem \ninteractions (May et al., 1979; Beddington & de la Mare, 1985; Mangel, 1988; \nButterworth, 1988). Consequently, there is a need to develop improved models of how \nthe distribution and density of krill aggregations might alter with krill abundance, and \nthe rate at which they can be exploited by both predators and the fishery. \nThe general approach of Butterworth & Thomson (1995) and Thomson et al. \n(2000) is a useful step towards defining predator requirements to use in establishing \ncatch limits for the fishery. The authors appropriately analysed the implications of \ntheir results and identified problems with the model assumptions or input data. \nHowever, these models provide a very specific view of the system, namely that krill \nabundance influences predator population dynamics through survival rate and that this \nrelationship is described by a simple monotonic function. There is only weak evidence \nfor a relationship between krill availability and adult fur seal survival (Boyd et \nal.,1995). The ability to migrate long distances (Boyd et al., 1998) and feed on \nalternative prey (Reid et al., 2005) might allow adults to survive periods of low krill \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 27\navailability. On the other hand, offspring production is likely to be sensitive to \nchanges in prey availability close to breeding colonies.  However, it is possible that \nthe feeding rate of individual seals will be influenced by the intensity of inter- and \nintraspecific competition and the availability of alternative prey, and might not be a \nmonotonic function of krill abundance. Catch limits for krill should be robust to these \nuncertainties about the process by which krill availability affects predator populations. \nIt will therefore be necessary to consider alternative models of this process to \nestablish the potential effects of krill harvesting on predator populations. \nConstable (2001) considered a more complex food-web structure in a model to \nillustrate the proposed development of management reference points in which \npredator production resulting from the consumption of fished species is used as an \nintegrated measure of food-web function. The model was developed to explore how \nany number of predators might respond to variation in any number of prey when prey \nvary independently of predator consumption. It gives results in terms of both \nabundance and production trajectories with the latter responding more immediately to \nprey availability than the former, and therefore typically having greater variability. \n Mori & Butterworth (2004) constructed a model of the dynamics of krill and \ntwo competing consumers: blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and minke whales \n(B. bonaerensis), from 1900 to 2000. Krill biomass was represented with a difference \nequation in which predation by whales was subtracted from logistic growth. Numbers \nof whales were represented by equations that included recruitment, natural mortality \nand catch. Recruitment to whale populations, and their predation rate on krill were \nasymptotic functions of krill biomass. The model estimated the carrying capacity for \nkrill and the abundance trajectories for all three species when it was supplied with \nbasic life history and functional response parameters and whale catch data, and was \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 28\ntuned to contemporary abundance estimates for the whale species. This study was \npotentially more realistic than that of May et al. (1979) because it used asymptotic \nfunctional responses, and it considered plausible ranges for many of its parameters. \nNot all parameter combinations gave plausible abundance trajectories, but by \nexamining those combinations that did give plausible results, the authors were able to \nsuggest potential characteristic functions for the whale species. This, of course, relies \non the assumption that the model is a reasonable description of the interactions \nbetween its component species. These plausible dynamics involved an increase in krill \nbiomass as harvesting depleted blue whale numbers. The increase in krill was \nfollowed by an increase in minke whales, which reduced the krill biomass to less than \nits original level. Minke whale populations were reduced by harvesting in the 1970s \nresulting in increased krill biomass in the 1990s and the first signs of a blue whale \nrecovery. However, there is no good evidence to support the suggested recent increase \nin krill abundance. \n This type of model is potentially useful in reconstructing the historical \ndynamics of the system and, indeed, predicting the future dynamics, but a lack of \nhistorical data makes it is difficult to assess whether this is a plausible view of the \ninteractions controlling ecosystem dynamics. By simplifying the system, it is possible \nthat the model misses important details. For example, no distinction is made between \nadult and juvenile whales in terms of their krill consumption or contribution to \nrecruitment. Also, the model assumes that the dynamics result from interactions \nbetween three species, again characterised by a specific form of functional response.  \nThe dynamics of baleen whales might well have been influenced by other krill \npredators, such as Antarctic fur seals, which have also undergone dramatic changes in \npopulation size. It also assumes that krill abundance is controlled by the top-down \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 29\neffects of predators and a fixed carrying capacity. The assumption of constant natural \nmortality rates and carrying capacity is necessary to find an equilibrium solution. \nHowever, in reality, these parameters can be both variable and time-dependent. While \nidentifying potential equilibrium conditions is a useful method, it might be impossible \nto establish whether an equilibrium ever really existed. \n The models of Butterworth & Thomson (1995), Murphy (1995), Thomson et \nal. (2000) and Constable (2001) all assume that there are no top-down effects of \npredation on prey recruitment, although Thomson et al. (2000) presented, but did not \nevaluate, a two-way model. Mori & Butterworth (2004), in common with May et al. \n(1979), necessarily include top-down effects in order to simulate interactions between \ncompeting predators. There is strong evidence that the bottom-up effects of \nenvironmental variability have had more influence than top-down effects on the recent \ndynamics of both krill and its predators (Forcada et al., 2005). However, the depletion \nof top predators can increase the influence of bottom-up relative to top-down controls. \nTherefore it is possible that the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down \ncontrols in the krill-based system has changed over time. \n These models involve different representations of the dynamic interactions \nbetween species, which are difficult to verify. It is unlikely that the representations of \npredator population structure, or the necessarily simplistic treatment of top-down and \nbottom-up controls used in these models will capture all of the important aspects of \nthe system\u2019s dynamics. However, these studies have suggested ways of linking the \ndynamics of predator and prey populations, which are transferable to more complex \nmodels. They have also explored the consequences of different forms in these \ninteraction functions. It is not clear however which interactions are necessary to \ninclude in models and which functional forms are most realistic. A modelling \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 30\napproach that compares the effects of different assumptions about these interactions \nwill be necessary to make informed decisions about harvesting. \n \n  \n(3) Inclusion of small-scale processes in models of predator-prey-fishery \ninteractions \n \nPopulation dynamics are the result of smaller scale processes such as individual \nbehaviour. The relationship between these scales has been explored in a set of models \nbased on dynamic programming methods (Mangel & Switzer, 1998; Alonzo & \nMangel, 2001; Alonzo, Switzer & Mangel, 2003a,b). Mangel & Switzer (1998) \nconsidered the spatial distribution of krill relative to a penguin colony, which was \naffected by diffusion and advection, and depleted by fishing and foraging. The model \nincorporated fishing fleet behaviour, a number of penguin breeding strategies, \npenguin foraging behaviour, and mortality risk to foraging penguins. The effects on \npenguins of krill harvesting were assessed in terms of reproductive success and \nparental survival, both of which showed a negative linear response to the total krill \ncatch. \nAlonzo & Mangel\u2019s (2001) dynamic state model suggests that the body size of \nkrill shrinks under a range of influences including thermal stress, food deprivation and \npredation pressure, and that the fine-scale distribution of krill is driven by the \nbehaviour of individuals. The authors suggest that the influence of predators is \nparticularly strong, such that the spatial distribution and size structure of krill \npopulations represents a trade-off between growth (which is a function of food \navailability and temperature) and survival (which is a function of predation pressure). \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 31\nHowever, Ritz (2002) observes that krill can adjust their swarm size in response to \npredation pressure and suggests that it is unnecessary to postulate shrinkage as a \nsurvival strategy.  \nAlonzo et al. (2003a,b) further developed the habitat selection model of \nAlonzo & Mangel (2001) to examine the reciprocal effects of penguins and krill on \nthe behavioural strategies of the two taxa and interactions between them, and to assess \nthe indirect effects of krill harvesting on penguin behaviour and foraging success. In \nthis approach, penguin behaviour influenced krill survival in offshore and onshore \nhabitats, affecting the distribution of krill between the two habitats. Food availability \nto penguins was influenced by habitat selection in krill, the foraging strategy of the \npenguins, and water temperature, which affected krill growth and therefore habitat \nchoice.  \nIn the absence of harvesting, the model of Alonzo et al. (2003a,b) suggests \nthat penguin foraging decisions could be a major influence on both taxa. Modelled \nkrill avoided predation by feeding at the surface at night only, and descending during \nthe day. However, smaller krill must spend more time feeding at the surface than \nlarger krill. Penguins that minimise their time spent foraging will not travel offshore \nwhereas penguins that maximise their consumption of prey will also forage offshore, \nwith a greater effect on the prey population and a greater susceptibility to the \ninfluence of fluctuations in prey abundance. Also, the environmental conditions that \nbest suit krill growth might allow them to evade capture by penguins and therefore \nreduce the predators\u2019 food intake.  \nWhen fishing was included in the model, the behaviour of krill was found to \namplify the negative effects of the fishery on the penguin population. This approach \ncould provide insights into population-level interactions that are difficult to capture \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 32\nwithout incorporating individual behaviour. Alonzo et al. (2003a) suggest that the \nimpact of fisheries could be assessed through monitoring specific aspects of the \nforaging behaviour of predators.   \nPopulation-level responses are the product of both the behavioural and \nphysiological responses of individuals. Individual-based modelling might therefore \nhelp to inform data collection on the links between processes at these two scales. This \ntype of model could also be used to identify and test appropriate functional \nrelationships (for example between exploitation rate and predator survival) that may \nbe useful in constructing models to manage the fishery. These relationships might not \nbe possible to determine empirically, so individual-based models are useful in both \nsuggesting plausible forms of these relationships, and determining whether they are \ncompatible with our understanding of the underlying processes. Individual-level \nresponses, such as behaviour or offspring production are often easier to monitor than \npopulation-level responses, so it might be necessary to include these effects in \npractical models. However, individual-based models should be used with caution as \nincorrect assumptions about small-scale processes may lead to serious errors at the \npopulation level. \n \n \nV. FOOD-WEB AND ECOSYSTEM MODELS \n \nThe ecosystem approach to fisheries will need models that capture critical processes \nat the community level. It will be particularly important to understand the structure of \nthe food-web and the food requirements of different trophic levels in order to \nrepresent the flow of energy or mass between them. Various authors have attempted \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 33\nto elaborate Southern Ocean food-webs and several studies have estimated the food \nrequirements of predators. Furthermore, a few complex ecosystem models, \nincorporating higher trophic levels, have been developed for parts of the Southern \nOcean, and various large-scale biogeochemical models, incorporating planktonic \necology, have also been developed.   \n \n \n(1) Estimates of consumption \n \nEverson (1977) used available data to quantify production and consumption in a \nsimplified representation of the Southern Ocean food-web with the intention of \nidentifying gaps in the available data. He calculated krill production based on \nestimates of primary production and conversion efficiencies. The problems \nencountered were general for this type of study. Firstly, it is difficult to account for \nchanging food availability, so the resulting view of energy flows was, at best, a \nsnapshot of a single situation. Secondly, data are often patchy, as highlighted by a \npaucity of information on consumption by fish and squid.  \nHempel (1985) noted that, because survival is energetically expensive in the \ncold and turbulent environment of the Southern Ocean, krill-based food-webs are \ninefficient converters of primary production into animal biomass. Subsequent \nattempts to model energy flow have generally focussed on consumption by higher \npredators. Croxall, Ricketts & Prince (1984), Croxall, Prince & Ricketts (1985) and \nCroxall, Ricketts & Wood (1990) modelled the consumption of krill and other prey by \nbirds and mammals. They based their calculations on estimates of the energetic costs \nof the daily activities performed by sections of the population at each stage in the \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 34\nbreeding cycle. These were then converted to food requirements of the predators using \ndata on diet composition, the energy content of prey and conversion efficiency. \nAlthough the latter was measured for macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and \nAntarctic fur seals, it had to be assumed for other predators. Impacts on prey \npopulations in specific locations were then inferred based on estimates of foraging \nrange and distribution of foraging effort.  \nOther authors have used a similar approach in scaling up prey consumption \nestimates from diet data or energetics calculations (Kock, 1985, Croll & Tershy, 1998; \nEverson et al., 1999, Boyd, 2002), to calculate the consumption of prey species (krill \nand icefish) by predator populations. Boyd (2002) used an algorithm incorporating \nmetabolism, growth, diet, life history and activity budgets to estimate prey \nconsumption by fur seals and macaroni penguins at South Georgia in 1991. The \nmodel was sensitive to life-history characteristics, which affect the age structure of the \npredator population, while other variables contributed <0.1% of the overall variance \nin the output. Not surprisingly, it was most sensitive to estimates of abundance of the \npredator populations.  With an appropriate predator population model, this approach \ncan be used to illustrate seasonal changes in demand and identify the life stages that \nare most susceptible to competition from the fishery.  \nThe method\u2019s shortcomings inevitably arise from inaccuracies in the input \ndata and its assumptions (Boyd, 2002).  Overall estimates of consumption of specific \nprey generally suffer from a lack of good data for all predators.  For example, Croxall \net al. (1990) were able to estimate daily consumption for the breeding part of seabird \npopulations and fur seals, which could be monitored at land-based colonies, but only \nannual estimates were possible for other seals.   \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 35\nThese approaches have been applied to predator communities at South \nGeorgia and the Scotia Sea, where seals and seabirds were estimated to have roughly \nequal prey requirements. Croxall et al. (1990) estimated that krill comprise 70% of the \ndiet of the predator assemblage considered, and identified crabeater seals (Lobodon \ncarcinophagus) and macaroni and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins as the \nmain krill consumers. As in many studies that followed, the estimated standing stocks \nof krill and fish were often low compared to estimates of consumption by predators \n(Croxall et al., 1985). Although these standing stock estimates do not indicate the \nproduction available for consumption, it is likely that either consumption was \noverestimated or krill abundance was underestimated (Nicol, Constable & Pauly, \n2000). Identifying the cause of these discrepancies could improve the methods and \nmodels used to estimate both consumption and prey availability.  \nEstimating the food requirements of consumers is a particularly important step \nin understanding the operation of food-webs. These estimates will be useful in \nparameterising more complex models of ecosystem dynamics. These models are also \npotentially useful in assessing the prey requirements of predator populations based on \ntheir size and demographic structure, and therefore in defining the limiting effects of \nprey availability. The ability to relate the status of a predator population to its prey \nconsumption implies a way to construct functional responses and to estimate local \nprey abundance from studies of predator populations.  However, the apparent \nmismatch between krill supply and predator demand suggests uncertainty in our \nunderstanding of the system, which must be either resolved or quantified. \n \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 36\n(2) Food-web models \n \nEarly conceptual models of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, in the form of qualitative \ndescriptions of the food-web, were produced by Hart (1942), Holdgate (1967), Knox \n(1970), and Everson (1977). There have also been three simulation studies that \nattempted to model multi-species interactions in the Southern Ocean ecosystem \n(Green, 1975, summarised in Green Hammond, 1981; Doi, 1979, summarised in \nShimadzu, 1985; Bredesen, 2003). \nGreen (1975) developed a Ross Sea annual model that simulated the flows of \ncarbon from nutrients to whales in a closed system. The model attempted to \nencapsulate some of the major dynamics of the ecosystem, such as the seasonal \nmigrations of great whales into the region. The species and nutrients in the system \nwere grouped into thirteen broad compartments that included the major constituents \nrepresented in the ecosystem models that proliferated two decades later. The approach \nalso recognised the multiple and often two-way energy transfer pathways that occur in \nnatural food-webs. However, the shortage of data meant that it was not testable as a \nsimulation model. \nDoi (1979) employed a network model consisting of 14 biological \ncompartments and four trophic levels.  Most species were harvested, and most of the \ndetail was in the upper trophic level (which included nine of the biological \ncompartments). This was a complex model with 137 variables and parameters, in \nwhich interactions among species were represented in terms of the energy flow from \nlower to higher trophic levels. For the equilibrium state, 12 of these energy flow terms \nwere parameterised from empirical data and the remaining nine were solved for in a \nprocess similar to the later \u201cmass balance\u201d approach (Polovina, 1984). Some standing \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 37\nstock and mortality estimates as well as catches were also obtained from the literature. \nOther terms were either given arbitrary values or estimated in the model. In \nsimulations, the phytoplankton standing stock and the predation rate upon it by krill \nand zooplankton were kept constant, so variations in krill abundance were due to the \ntop-down effects of harvesting and predation. With whale exploitation at 1975 levels \n(which were well below peak levels) but no krill harvesting, the model predicted a \nrecovery of whale populations and a consequent decline in krill due to increased \nconsumption. With krill harvesting at 10 million tonnes per year, the model predicted \nrecovery in most whale populations. Both scenarios resulted in a decline in fish stocks \ndue to predation by increasing numbers of seals and penguins. The study again \nsuffered from the lack of empirical knowledge of the system.  For example, squid \nwere modelled as important krill predators even though few data were available.  \nOver the last two decades the mass balance approach has been widely used for \nconstructing models of aquatic ecosystems (Christensen & Pauly, 2004). These have \ngenerally used the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software suite (Christensen & \nWalters, 2004), in which a series of linear equations are solved such that the overall \nconsumption of prey biomass is balanced with the production of biomass within each \npredator group plus respiration and biomass lost from the system. The assumption that \nthe system has a single balance point allows this method to estimate missing values \nwhen only some of the required parameters have been measured for each trophic \ngroup. \nPlag\u00e1nyi & Butterworth (2004) considered the suitability of EwE for \naddressing the management of krill and its predators in the Southern Ocean. They \nfound the inclusion of Ecospace, which implements spatially resolved dynamic \nmodels, useful for addressing the issues of krill schooling and the different foraging \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 38\nranges of land-based and pelagic predators. They also suggest that EwE will be useful \nfor investigating complex interactions, such as competition between krill and salps for \nphytoplankton. Ecosim divides prey populations into those that are vulnerable and \nthose that are not vulnerable to predation by each predator. This is a potential \nweakness in assessing the effects of changes in krill abundance, as it is effectively an \na priori specification of the relative competitive abilities of the predators. While the \nvulnerability settings are also potentially useful in representing differences between \nland-based and pelagic predators in access to prey, the manner in which functional \nfeeding relationships can be established is not clear at present. The current \nspecification of EwE would not capture physical influences on krill population \ndynamics, changes in predator life-history traits in response to changing prey \navailability, the apparent density-independent preference of many predators for krill \nas a prey, the abrupt switching between prey types that has been suggested for some \npredators, or the disproportionate effects of prey shortages on early life stages. Each \nof these issues is potentially surmountable in future versions of EwE. However, the \nnecessary assumption of a contemporary equilibrium is problematic for an ecosystem \nthat is both naturally variable and probably changing states. The constraint of this \nassumption might prevent EwE from capturing the processes that drive the system \naway from equilibrium (Hollowed et al., 2000). \nIn addition to the possibility that a system might be in a \u201ctransient phase\u201d \nrather than at equilibrium, there are two further reasons why the assumption of a \nsingle balance point might be inappropriate. The first is the practical issue of \nparameterising the model with data collected at different times and different places \nthat may represent different states in the system or different extremes of natural \nvariation. The second is the related issue that uncertainty about these parameter values \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 39\nmight imply multiple potential balance points, and therefore require a model that \nidentifies all possible balance points. \nEwE was used to model the krill-based food-web around South Georgia, \nrepresented by 29 compartments (Bredesen, 2003).  The main predators of krill were \nfound to be squid and fish, especially myctophids. Simulation of increased krill \nfishing suggested that mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, would be the \ndependent species worst affected by the fishery, mainly because it is a by-catch \nspecies, and that whales and fur seals would also suffer declines. The ecology of the \nSouth Georgia area is strongly affected by the apparently variable transport of krill as \nwell as the seasonal migration of predators, so it is inappropriate to regard the area as \na self-contained ecosystem. Adequately accounting for interactions with other areas is \na major challenge in developing complex models at this scale. \nThese whole-ecosystem models reinforce the comment of Everson (1977) that \nthe krill-based ecosystem is simple only by comparison with other aquatic systems. \nPathways that do not include krill, and consumers that are not well studied, are also \nlikely to be important to the functioning of the ecosystem. In general, attempts to \nparameterise complex food-web models have been useful exercises in compiling \navailable information that inevitably identify the lack of available data on food-web \ninteractions, particularly the various rate processes. \n The mass balance approach is potentially useful in solving for unknown \nparameters, such as biomass, in partially observed systems, subject to the caveats \nabove. EwE in particular has promoted widespread interest in modelling the \necosystem dynamics of harvested marine systems. Carefully constructed EwE models \ncould be used to predict the potential consequences of management strategies, but \nshould not be accepted as the definitive predictions. The drawbacks of this approach \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 40\nare the high data requirements, including for parts of the system that are not well \nstudied, and inability to estimate the uncertainty associated with model structure (both \ninternal functions and assumed trophic relationships). The important dynamics in a \ngiven system might be adequately represented by models of partial food-webs \nfocusing on key species. However, these will need to be specifically constructed, with \napproaches appropriate to the system and its component species. \n \n \n(3) Large-scale models of the Southern Ocean ecosystem \n  \nA range of models, with varying complexity, of lower trophic level interactions in the \nSouthern Ocean have been developed. Recent models of note include the three-\ndimensional coupled model of Hense et al. (2003), which studied phytoplankton \ndynamics in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Antarctic Polar Front; Arrigo, \nWorthen & Robinson\u2019s (2003) model of nutrient and plankton dynamics in the Ross \nSea; and Lancelot et al.\u2019s (2000) model of primary production in the Atlantic sector of \nthe Southern Ocean.  These models focus on the biogeochemical and microbial \ncomponents of the ecosystem and have little or no representation of the larger \nzooplankton species or any of the higher trophic level species.   \nWalsh, Dieterle & Lenes (2001) developed a detailed simulation of planktonic \nprocesses and their interaction with the physical environment. Plankton interactions \ninclude protozoan grazing on flagellates, which promotes diatom growth by reducing \ncompetition. Diatoms are the major food for larval krill, and may have a negative \nimpact on salps, a potential competitor of krill (Loeb et al., 1997), through clogging \ntheir feeding apparatus. This illustrates the potential for complex feedback in the \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 41\nplanktonic part of the food-web, so the consequences of a change in the physical \nenvironment are not easy to predict. \nHuntley, Lopez & Karl (1991) used a simple compartmental design to model \ncarbon flux in the Southern Ocean food-web, to explore the idea that artificial \nenhancement of primary production could cause the ecosystem to sequester \natmospheric carbon dioxide (Martin, Fitzwater & Gordon, 1990). This model \nsuggested that the ecosystem is an inefficient carbon sink because much of the carbon \nfixed in primary production is returned to the atmosphere via respiration from \npredators. However, Priddle et al. (1998) calculated that the carbon respired by \nendotherm predators in the Southern Ocean would be a fraction of that implied by \nHuntley et al. (1991). Moloney (1992) also challenged Huntley et al. (1991) on the \nbasis of observations from the subtropical Benguela ecosystem, which suggest that the \nmodel was an oversimplification and that less carbon would be returned to the \natmosphere.    \n Each of these models gives potential insight into processes that could \nultimately affect the krill-based system. It is notable that the models exploring the \neffects of fisheries rarely consider the influence of trophic levels below krill, and it \nwould be useful to examine the likely interactions between the upper and lower \ntrophic levels. Currently, these lower trophic level models are not formulated to \nanswer questions relating to the management of the fishery. Adapting them to do so \nwill mean linking them to models at very different scales. \n \n \nVI. ASSESSMENT AND FISHERY MODELS \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 42\n \n(1) Estimating krill yield  \n \nCatch limits for the Southern Ocean krill fishery are set using a population \nprojection model to determine the probability distributions of krill spawning stock \nbiomass before and after the removal of a given annual catch (Butterworth et al., \n1994). This is used to find the highest long-term annual catch that meets a three-part \ndecision rule (see Constable et al., 2000 for a detailed discussion). To produce these \nprobability distributions the projection model is run thousands of times for each catch \nscenario, with parameter values for most variables drawn at random from distributions \nestimated from empirical data.   The aim of this approach is to integrate across \nuncertainties in an estimate of krill biomass from an acoustic survey, and estimates of \npopulation processes, particularly recruitment, natural mortality, age at maturity and \nvulnerability to the fishery. \nThe decision rule allows for the escapement of a stock considered sufficient to \nmaintain recruitment, and it makes provision for the requirements of predators by \nensuring that the fishery does not deplete the krill stock to less than 75% of its \nunexploited size. 75% escapement is the midpoint between no fishery (100% \nescapement) and the 50% level that results in maximum sustainable yield in the \nSchaeffer surplus production model because logistic population growth is highest at \nhalf the asymptotic population size. However, this is not suggested as a realistic view \nof the system, rather an arbitrary but conservative level that has been adopted until a \nmore appropriate estimate can be found. The models of Butterworth & Thomson \n(1995) and Thomson et al. (2000) were specifically designed to address this issue. \nThe decision rule also requires that the krill stock is maintained above 20% of its \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 43\nmedian unexploited biomass to ensure future recruitment, but again this reference \nlevel is arbitrary. \nThe general approach used in the krill yield model is useful in evaluating \nuncertainty in krill population dynamics without explicit reference to interactions with \nother trophic levels.  It therefore makes pragmatic simplifications, especially about \nrecruitment, and should not be interpreted as a definitive description of krill \npopulation processes. However, improved understanding of these processes could \nallow the development of a more realistic population model, and allow input values to \nbe constrained to a narrower range, potentially reducing uncertainty in the output. \nThere are also some uncertainties that are not accounted for, including the \ninterpretation of acoustic data on which the estimate of krill biomass is based (Demer \n& Conti, 2005).   \nThis is a single-species approach that identifies an appropriate krill yield based \non a decision rule that can be refined as our understanding of predator requirements \nand krill recruitment dynamics improves. However, the management advice resulting \nfrom this approach must be evaluated in order to be confident that objectives for the \nkrill and its dependent species will be met despite uncertainties in knowledge (de la \nMare, 1998; Cooke, 1999; Smith, Sainsbury & Stevens, 1999, Constable, 2002, 2004; \nYodzis, 1994).  We consider the use of multispecies models to evaluate management \nstrategies in section VII. \n  \n \n(2) Models of the krill fishery \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 44\nMangel (1988) & Butterworth (1988) developed models of the interaction between \nkrill aggregations and harvesting operations to assess the utility of catch rate data as a \nproxy for krill abundance. The studies concentrated on the Japanese (Butterworth, \n1988) and Soviet (Mangel, 1988) krill fisheries, which had different fishing strategies. \nIn the Soviet system, a separate research vessel would search for concentrations, in \nconjunction with the fishing fleet, but individual fishing vessels would search for \nswarms within concentrations (Mangel, 1988). In the model of the Japanese system, \nfishing vessels worked independently to locate concentrations and find swarms within \nthem (Butterworth, 1988). \nA fundamental feature of these models was the representation of krill \naggregations in both space and time (Murphy et al., 1988). Spatially, both studies \nused a hierarchy of \u201cpatches within patches\u201d. That is, krill form swarms that are in \nturn aggregated into larger concentrations. Both Butterworth (1988) and Mangel \n(1988) represented swarms as (initially) circular patches with characteristic radius \n(around 50 m) and krill density. The swarms themselves were randomly placed in a \nconcentration that was also circular with characteristic radius (around 5 to 11 nautical \nmiles). At a larger scale, the habitat was divided into strata with characteristic \nconcentration densities. Although krill aggregations have a third spatial dimension \n(depth), the models were effectively reduced to two dimensions. In Mangel (1988), \nconcentrations were moved each day to represent the temporal variability of krill \naggregations. \nThese studies found that catch rate is a poor index of krill density as vessels \nrelocate to unexploited patches to maintain high catch rates despite declines in the \noverall abundance of krill. There is therefore a need to distinguish between time spent \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 45\nfishing and time spent searching, although there may be practical difficulties in \ndistinguishing between searching for concentrations and searching for swarms. \nMay et al. (1979) commented that krill distribution may be an important \nmodifier of predator-fishery interactions, and these studies highlighted the need to \nimprove the spatial model of krill distribution.  The methods used by Butterworth \n(1988) and Mangel (1988) are potentially useful in simulating krill distribution to \nderive functional relationships for these interactions. However, this level of spatial \nresolution is impractical and impossible to initialise in models of ecosystem dynamics \nto guide management decisions.  \nSeveral of the models described in this review have considered the general \nissue of competition between krill predators and the fishery. However, because the \ndistributions of krill, its predators and fishing effort are highly heterogeneous, the \nintensity of this competition will be spatially variable. Krill fisheries tend to operate \nclose to land, in areas that are extensively used by krill predators such as seals and \npenguins, especially during the breeding season.  The potential for overlap between \nthese fisheries and predator foraging grounds is widely recognised (Agnew & Phegan, \n1995; Croll & Tershy, 1998). Models exploring this overlap show that the fishery \ncould have localised impacts on predator populations, even with a precautionary \noverall catch limit (Agnew & Marin, 1994; Marin & Delgado, 2001). Reid et al. \n(2004) showed that although they operate at different spatial scales, there was near-\ncomplete overlap between fisheries and predators in the Scotia Sea.  \n \n \nVII. DISCUSSION \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 46\nThe modelling effort described in this review has used a variety of approaches to \naddress various questions at a range of scales. Many of these studies have explicitly \nfocused on the Scotia Sea area where there is a concentration of krill biomass, fishing \noperations and scientific activity. It is not possible to extrapolate specific results to the \nSouthern Ocean as a whole because of the scale and variability of the system. \nHowever, results concerning the applicability of existing models and the requirements \nof future models are more generally relevant. \nThe future management of the Scotia Sea krill fishery, and of other fisheries \nworldwide, will need reliable models to predict the future state of the system. This \nstate in any location, at any time is the result of interacting biological and physical \nprocesses that are highly variable in space and time. The modelling effort has \ngenerally focused on specific processes or theoretical explorations of ecosystem \ndynamics. It is now important to consider how these studies can contribute to the \ndevelopment of models that make quantitative predictions about the food-web effects \nof harvesting. \nOur understanding of krill recruitment dynamics remains vague, with few \nprocess models to predict recruitment. However, empirical models suggest strong \nenvironmental influences. There are consistent patterns of recruitment variation \nthroughout the Scotia Sea. These patterns are correlated with sea-ice extent, which in \nturn has apparent decadal-scale pseudo-cycles in its variability. This suggests the \npossibility of forecasting krill recruitment based on predicted ice cover. It also \nsuggests that autocorrelation in krill recruitment should be considered in population \ndynamics models. \nIt will be more problematic to model spawning stock effects on krill \nrecruitment. Logically, successful recruitment must depend on the presence of a \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 47\ncritical biomass in a suitable area. The methods of Hofmann & H\u00f9srev\u00f5glu (2003) \nmay be useful for identifying this area, especially if they are used with a transport \nmodel to predict the fate of krill larvae. However, current information on stock \nstructure and stock-recruitment relationships is not sufficient to revise CCAMLR\u2019s \nassumption that the Scotia Sea krill stock should be maintained above 20% of its \nmedian unexploited biomass.  \nThe spatial distribution of krill will affect its interactions with predators and \nthe fishery. These processes will be scale dependent, with advection driving the \ncoarse-scale distribution and behaviour becoming more important at finer scales. \nOutput from numerical ocean models such as OCCAM will be useful in predicting \nkrill transport at a coarse scale (e.g. Murphy et al., 2004a) but there are no process \nmodels describing the local retention of krill. There are, however, empirical \nrelationships with oceanographic features, and the approach of Murphy (1995) could \nbe used to identify plausible bounds for retention based on predator demand. \nThe size structure of krill populations will affect their attractiveness to \nfisheries, and their interactions with predators and physical processes. It is clearly \nimportant to capture this size structure in models. The influences on size structure \ninclude recruitment, growth, and the potential size-specific effects of transport and \nmortality. According to Alonzo & Mangel (2001), size could also be a function of an \nindividual krill\u2019s survival strategy. Models of small-scale processes, including \nbehaviour and growth, have generally proved useful in developing theory and guiding \nresearch. However, their assumptions have not been verified, and they can only make \npredictions when supplied with detailed data on interacting ecosystem components. \nThese data are generally unavailable. In particular, there are no models to predict the \ndistribution and abundance of lower trophic levels at relevant scales. Consequently, \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 48\ndetailed models of fine-scale processes are not suitable for predicting ecosystem \ndynamics. Nonetheless, such models could be used to suggest functional relationships \nbetween ecosystem components, which will be necessary for constructing ecosystem \ndynamics models.  \nMost models used to explore predator-prey dynamics in the Southern Ocean, \nwith the exception of Butterworth & Thomson (1995) and Thomson et al. (2000) do \nnot consider the demographic structure of the predator population and most, with the \nexception of Murphy (1995), have no spatial structure. These models either assume a \n\u201cclosed loop\u201d in which the system\u2019s dynamics are driven entirely by harvesting and \ninteractions between the modelled species, or they assume that krill dynamics are not \ninfluenced by predator abundance. Furthermore, the interaction between species is \nreduced to a single functional response. This degree of simplification is unlikely to \ncapture the local dynamics of predator populations or the impact of predation on krill \npopulations. \nThere is a contrast between the level of detail in these predator-prey models \nand those used to estimate prey consumption by predators. These consumption models \ncompile information on the energy requirements, diets, activities and population \nstructure of predators. They should be useful for identifying the characteristics that \ncontribute to changes in local demand for prey and that ecosystem dynamics models \nwill need to incorporate.   \n Although some attempts have been made to model complex food-webs in the \nSouthern Ocean, there is a shortage of data on substantial parts of these food-webs. \nMass or energy balance models are able to estimate missing parameters, but their \nassumptions cannot be verified. Further assumptions are needed to simulate \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 49\necosystem dynamics and it is impossible to assess whether these models truly reflect \nthe structure and operation of the real system. \n Models predicting the state of harvested systems will need to include more \ndetail on population structure, food-web complexity and trophic interactions than is \nfound in simple predator-prey models. The level of detail assigned to each ecosystem \ncomponent should be defined by the purpose of the model and the availability of data. \nEcosystem dynamics models designed to predict the effects of human activities on \nharvested species and other ecosystem attributes should include the important \ncharacteristics of the harvested species. The rest of the model should be designed \naround the other ecosystem attributes to be considered. CCAMLR\u2019s conservation \nobjectives concern harvested, \u201cdependent\u201d and \u201crelated\u201d species, so relevant models \nmust include details that are important to the dynamics of these species. Many other \nindicators of ecosystem status have been proposed, ranging from the performance of \nindividual species to community characteristics like biodiversity, size spectra and \nmean trophic level. The appropriate model structure therefore depends on both the \ncharacteristics of the system and the metrics used to assess its state. Bespoke models \ndesigned to address specific problems, based on specialised knowledge of the focal \nsystem are likely to be more relevant than generalised models. These generalised \nmodels might not accommodate the appropriate functions or level of detail, and might \nbe constrained by requirements to specify details for less well-understood parts of the \nsystem. \nAlmost every study that we have discussed has identified considerable \nuncertainty in the parameter, function or trophic relationship of interest. The extent of \nthis uncertainty is unsurprising given the scale of the system and the gaps in the \navailable data. However, the potential expansion of the krill fishery in the near future \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 50\nleaves little time to increase our understanding. This problem is common to most \nmarine ecosystems: the requirement to implement ecosystem approaches to fisheries \nby 2010 implies a requirement to achieve this based on current levels of knowledge. It \nmight be possible to refine our comprehension of some key processes in the short \nterm, but we cannot postpone the development of the ecosystem approach until this \ntask is complete. Future management of marine ecosystems should be robust to \nuncertainties in our understanding of these systems, and the models used to support \nthis management must provide explicit quantification of this uncertainty. \nThe processes affecting the distribution and abundance of krill and its \npredators are subject to high degrees of spatial and temporal variation. Modelling \nstudies have improved our understanding of these processes. It is now necessary to \nproduce predictive models that incorporate the large-spatial-scale dynamics of krill \npopulations, and smaller scale interactions with the fishery and local populations of \nland-based predators. Integrating across scales and ensuring that key processes are \nrepresented sufficiently will require attention to the level of detail at each scale. \nQuantifying uncertainty will require the construction of models that provide a range \nof forecasts representing the potential future dynamics suggested by our knowledge of \nthe system and the uncertainties associated with this knowledge. The following \nsections discuss these general issues of complexity and model uncertainty in more \ndetail before considering the requirements for an ecosystem dynamics model of the \nScotia Sea. \n \n \n(1) Complexity \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 51\nThere is a trade-off between the complexity and utility of models. While too \nlittle detail might result in a model that fails to capture important aspects of the \nsystem, too much detail is computationally expensive, and produces high levels of \nuncertainty and output that might be impossible to interpret (Fulton et al., 2003). An \nobvious first step in designing a model is to define its purpose. CCAMLR will require \nmodels to predict the dynamics of krill and its predators. The models should focus on \nthe processes driving the dynamics of these focal species. However, it is not necessary \nto include all of the relevant complexity in a single model. Detailed models of specific \nprocesses can be used to derive functions or parameter distributions to summarise \nthese processes in ecosystem dynamics models, or to test the effects of different \nmodel structures. This approach allows models operating at different scales to be used \ntogether (Salvanes, 2001; Fulton et al., 2003; deYoung et al., 2004).  \nModel complexity can be minimized by limiting the number of food-web \ninteractions included. The choice of food-web components and interactions is a \ncentral issue in modelling ecosystem dynamics and output is often more sensitive to \nthe complexity of the modelled food-web than any other factor (Punt & Butterworth, \n1995; Bax, 1998).  We advocate the development of  \u201cminimum realistic models\u201d that \ninclude only species that have important interactions with the focal species (Punt & \nButterworth, 1995). These models may use different approaches for different trophic \nlevels, with most detail at the level of the focal species (deYoung et al., 2004).  \nSpecies other than the focal species may be aggregated into functional groups with \nsimilar characteristics, as long as these groups do not include organisms that prey on \nother members of the group, or organisms with rate constants that differ by more than \nthreefold (Fulton et al., 2003). If the group of other consumers includes species with \nvery different competitive abilities or levels of specialisation on a particular prey \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 52\nspecies, the performance of this group will depend on the relative abundance of its \ncomponent species. However, excessive aggregation of prey species can exaggerate \nthe level of competition amongst predators (deYoung et al., 2004).  It is not necessary \nto include all life stages of species that only interact with focal species during part of \ntheir life history. Where different life stages have different interactions with the focal \nspecies, it is necessary to represent this ontogenetic complexity (Hollowed et al., \n2000), for example by including the different life stages in different functional groups. \nIn designing a minimum realistic model it is necessary to consider what \nconstitutes an important interaction. Minority prey species should be included if they \nbecome important when major prey species are scarce, or if they play \u201ckeystone\u201d \nroles in ecosystem structure or are otherwise limiting, for example because they \nprovide essential nutrients. Otherwise excluding interactions accounting for up to 10% \nof consumption of and by species in the model might have minimal effects on its \npredictions (Yodzis, 1998). It is also necessary to consider how to represent \ninfluences other than those explicitly included in the model. For example, a variable \nnatural mortality rate could be used to represent the combined effects of several \npredators. \nSome representation of spatial complexity is necessary because spatial \nprocesses influence the dynamics and stability of most systems (Hollowed et al., \n2000; Fulton et al., 2003) and fisheries target specific areas. The degree of spatial \ncomplexity needed in a model will depend on its purpose. Although biological \ninteractions between predators and their competitors and prey will be affected by the \nspatial distribution and motility of each, these interactions may be adequately \ncaptured by functional relationships with no spatial resolution. These relationships \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 53\nmight be difficult to establish empirically, but plausible functions could be derived \nusing spatially resolved, individual-based models (Berec & Krivan, 2000).  \nModels do not have to be entirely process-based. That is, they can include \nempirical, rather than mechanistic, representations of important but poorly understood \ninteractions. Although this approach can produce misleading results  (Fulton et al., \n2003), empirical models can be less prone to bias than incorrectly specified food-web \nmodels (Essington, 2004). This is therefore one method of minimising model \nuncertainty, at least within the domain specified by the data (Fulton et al., 2003).  \n Practical models of ecosystem dynamics must be possible to understand and \nuse, and must also produce meaningful results. It is therefore necessary to minimise \ncomplexity while maintaining relevance. Parsimonious models will not make \npredictions about non-focal species or general ecosystem characteristics like diversity \nor maturity. They will however make specific and relevant predictions about the \neffects of harvesting if they focus on directly affected species and those indirectly \naffected species for which conservation objectives are specified.  \n \n \n(2) Model uncertainty \n \nThe sources of uncertainty in data and models are reviewed in Francis & \nShotton (1997), Butterworth & Punt (1999), Patterson et al. (2001) and Regan, \nColyvan, & Burgman (2002). There are well-developed methods for dealing with \nmany sources of uncertainty, particularly those relating to natural variation and \nobservation errors, although little effort has been devoted to establishing the reliability \nof the resulting uncertainty estimates (Patterson et al., 2001). Less attention has been \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 54\ndevoted to the issue of model uncertainty, which is due to incomplete information \nabout how to represent real systems in models.  \nIn its simplest sense, model uncertainty can be due to a lack of information \nabout the appropriate value for a particular parameter. It can also relate to different \nfuture scenarios such as regime shift and climate change, which might be represented \nas numerical inputs into an ecosystem dynamics model. Finally, it can relate to the \nstructure of the model, such as the specification of functional relationships or which \ntrophic links are included.  \nUncertainty in model results can be represented by presenting these results as \nprobability distributions. These can be generated using Monte Carlo projection in \nwhich the model is run numerous times with the elements affected by uncertainty \nrandomly selected from a choice representing that uncertainty (Francis & Shotton, \n1997).  Bayesian methods also give results as probability distributions and they have \nbeen used to integrate uncertainties due to model structure in single-species models \n(McAllister & Kirchner, 2002). \nIn order to evaluate model uncertainty, it will be necessary to consider the \nrange of plausible alternative model structures as well as parameter values in Monte \nCarlo projections. This does not necessarily mean that the overall model should \ninclude the explicit structures of each set of alternative sub-models. In some cases, a \nset of alternative sub-models could be summarised by a distribution of input values \nfor the next stage in the model. Also, where possible, alternative structures should be \nrepresented with smooth functions that take different forms depending on \nparameterisation (McAllister & Kirchner, 2002). Defining all the potential models of \na given biological process, let alone a complex system, would be intractable. \nHowever, most potential models are unlikely, and many will produce similar results. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 55\nThe alternative models should therefore be a limited set of plausible models that \nincludes the most divergent views of the system (McAllister & Kirchner, 2002), \nprovided these views are consistent with the precautionary approach. Ideally the \ninfluence of any model on the results would be weighted by an objective measure of \nits plausibility, such as its ability to explain historical data.  \nIn the absence of data to assess the plausibility of models, it is possible to \nassign semi-objective weighting by following pre-defined guidelines such as those of \nButterworth, Punt & Smith (1996). The final alternative is to assign the models equal \nweights and to ensure that the set of alternatives is well balanced to minimise bias due \nto extreme views of the system. In practice there is a danger that undue weight will be \ngiven to politically or commercially motivated views, or models that unintentionally \nbias the results. Individual models should be carefully scrutinised and their \nimplications evaluated before they are used in the Monte Carlo framework.   \nBecause there may be sets of alternative sub-models at various stages in the \noverall model, Monte Carlo projections must be implemented in a way that ensures \nthat only sets of logically compatible sub-models are used in each individual run. \nHowever, it is not necessary to have multiple sub-models for every process as even \ndiverging models of a system are likely to include some structural similarities, \nespecially for processes supported by strong empirical relationships. \nAlthough little work has been devoted to the assessment of model uncertainty, \nwe believe it can be taken into account in models forecasting the ecosystem effects of \nfishing. The approach is relatively simple, requiring a choice of alternative sub-\nmodels for individual processes in Monte Carlo projections. There are several \ndrawbacks: the addition of alternative sub-models will increase the complexity of the \noverall model; objectivity in the choice of alternative sub-models and weighting \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 56\nregimes cannot be guaranteed; and the real system might be outside the range \nsuggested by the chosen models. However, expert opinion on what constitutes a \nplausible range of alternative models will provide an explicit measure of model \nuncertainty whereas the use of a single \u201cbest\u201d model will not. \n \n \n(3) Applying this approach to the Scotia Sea krill fishery \n \nHere we describe the main characteristics of a practical ecosystem dynamics \nmodel for the Scotia Sea area (Figs 2 & 3). We do not specify the mathematical \ndetails of the model. Instead, we present a framework that can accommodate \nalternative specifications for each of its component processes and is intended to be \nused in Monte Carlo simulations to integrate uncertainty in parameter values and \nmodel structure.  \nThe purpose of the model is to predict the effects of specified krill harvesting \nstrategies on parts of the ecosystem that are most relevant to CCAMLR\u2019s aims and \nactivities:  the krill stock, selected krill predators, and the fishery. The model could be \nused, for example, to assess the performance of candidate management strategies in a \nManagement Strategy Evaluation approach (Sainsbury et al., 2000). The model\u2019s \nmain outputs concern parts of the ecosystem that are routinely monitored (the grey \nbubbles in Fig. 2). Its predictions are therefore made in terms of the same metrics that \nwill be used for judging the state of the real ecosystem. This is particularly important \nbecause management cannot rely solely on predictive models, and might have to be \nrevised if the system deviates from its predicted state. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 57\nA suite of predators are monitored at breeding sites on islands throughout the \nScotia Sea, and CCAMLR has defined small-scale management units (SSMUs) \naround these islands, based on predator foraging ranges (Hewitt et al., 2004b). The \nproposed model is spatially resolved to the SSMU scale. Each spatial unit would have \nits own set of parameter distributions to capture spatial differences in characteristics \nsuch as krill growth rate. The units would be linked, mainly through the advection of \nkrill, but the migration of predators could also be accommodated. The temporal \nresolution of the model must account for seasonal differences in the behaviour of \nfocal species, especially predators that migrate away from breeding areas outside of \nthe breeding season.  \nEach spatial unit has a size-structured krill population. There is no explicit \nrepresentation of interactions with lower trophic levels because there are no available \nmodels to predict phytoplankton availability at appropriate scales. The model \ntherefore integrates uncertainty in krill recruitment and growth as in the krill yield \nmodel. However, the parameter values used for any time period can be constrained to \nrepresent the influence of the physical environment. This can be used to explore the \neffects of scenarios such as gradual warming. Recruitment can also be linked to the \nsize of the spawning stock in any combination of spatial units. The effects of \nadvection are modelled through the specification of transport rates between SSMUs \nderived, for example, from Murphy et al.\u2019s (2004a) transport model. Finally, the krill \npopulation is reduced by size-specific mortality as a result of interactions with \npredators and the fishery. \nCCAMLR does not routinely monitor the overall size of the krill stock due to \nconsiderable logistic and financial constraints, but the Convention specifies the need \nto maintain populations of harvested species at or above levels that ensure stable \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 58\nrecruitment. Local indices of krill abundance, such as the density in key areas, are \navailable. A survey model must therefore link monitored indices to spawning stock \nbiomass.  \nThe model also focuses on monitored predator species. CCAMLR selected the \nsuite of monitored species partly for practical reasons of accessibility and continuity \nand partly because their collective response to krill harvesting is thought to indicate \nthat of a broader group of krill predators. Although conservation objectives concern \nall predators in this broader group, the effectiveness of krill fishery management in \nachieving these objectives must be assessed principally through the performance of \nthe monitored predators. \nPopulation models for these species must be stage-structured to account for \ndifferences between juvenile and reproductively mature animals. The key food-web \ninteractions are between these predators and krill. There are many potential sub-\nmodels of the process by which krill availability influences predator population size. \nThere is strong evidence for links between krill abundance and predator offspring \nproduction (Reid et al., 2005; Forcada et al., 2005), but influences on survival and \nmigration should also be considered. The availability of alternative prey and the \nabundance of competitor species will also influence this process. Facilitative \ninteractions where, for example, the presence of pelagic predators benefits seabirds by \ndriving prey to the surface, may be as important as competitive interactions. As the \nperformance data collected in CCAMLR\u2019s ecosystem monitoring program generally \nrelate to offspring production, predator dynamics models must generate analogous \ndata. Recruitment to predator populations should therefore be modelled as a two-stage \nprocess incorporating offspring production and juvenile survival. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 59\nIn addition to krill and monitored predators, the models should represent other \nkrill consumers and important alternative prey for the monitored species. The group of \nalternative prey should include only vulnerable life stages. Many of the other \nconsumers could be grouped together. Uncertainties about these species might be \nrepresented by drawing their abundances from one or more distributions. \nModelling food-web interactions requires detailed information about the \ntrophic relationships among species. There are extensive diet data for many predators \nat various sites on sub-Antarctic islands. These datasets reveal changes over time, \nwhich have been linked to changes in the abundance of krill (Hill, Reid & North, \n2005; Reid et al., 2005). They are therefore potentially useful in establishing both the \nkey trophic interactions of these species and appropriate feeding functions. There are \nalso data on the diets and population sizes of other krill consumers like baleen whales \nand some fish. However, our understanding of these other krill consumers remains \nseverely limited.  \nThe model must also include the spatially resolved and size-specific effects of \nfishing mortality on krill populations. This can be modelled as an implementation of a \nproposed harvesting strategy, but any potential effects of illegal, unregulated and \nunreported catch should also be considered. Although the fishery provides fine-scale \ncatch data, commercial companies are likely to aim to maximise performance (catch \nor profit) over the whole fishing season, so annualised catch will be an appropriate \noutput. \n \n \n(4) Concluding remarks \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 60\nThe utility of any modelling approach depends on the availability and quality \nof relevant data. There is, in fact, an abundance of data available for the Southern \nOcean ecosystem, but this is subject to considerable temporal and spatial variability \nand uncertainty in the data and their interpretation. It is important to ensure that the \ndata themselves are understood, and to be aware that snapshots of limited time periods \nor areas may introduce bias. This is another reason for developing models that focus \non key species rather than attempting to model everything. However, more data \ncollection and analysis is required to implement the model proposed above. \nSpecifically, it is necessary to estimate the population sizes of the relevant predators \nand their competitors and to model the interactions between predator species, their \ncompetitors and the fishery. However, it is not necessary to establish definitive values \nor functions in the short term, only to define the range of plausible alternatives that \ncan be used to assess uncertainty. \nPredicting the effects of harvesting on krill and its monitored predators \nrequires models of the dynamics within a relatively small partial food-web with direct \nconnections between the target species and monitored predators. These models might \nbe simpler to develop than those required for other exploited marine systems with \nmore complex interactions between relevant species. The fact that the focal species \nhave direct trophic connections limits the number of potentially relevant food-web \nstructures. In systems where the focal species are separated by longer food-chains it \nmight be necessary to consider the potential for the relative importance of different \ntrophic pathways to vary over time \nThe ecosystem effects of human activities and environmental influences \npotentially include restructuring of the food-web and sudden shifts in the factors \ncontrolling ecosystem dynamics. For example, hypothetical scenarios in the Southern \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 61\nOcean include increased dominance of krill competitors such as salps, or disruptions \nto ocean stratification and circulation caused by increased freshwater run-off. The \nmodel illustrated in Fig. 3 will not predict these effects. It will be possible to adapt the \nmodel to incorporate such scenarios as they are proposed. However, an obvious \nlimitation of most predictive models is that the range of scenarios they can predict is \nlimited by their structure, which, in turn, is limited by what is considered plausible. \nThe uncertainty estimate generated by such models must be viewed in this context, \nrather than as a definitive quantification of all possible uncertainty. \nThere is considerable current interest in modelling exploited resources in an \necosystem context (Shannon et al., 2004).  This has resulted in a variety of approaches \nto modelling ecosystem dynamics, none of which has yet been used to inform the \nmanagement of marine fisheries in the Southern Ocean or elsewhere. Quantification \nof uncertainty is an important feature of the single-species models employed in the \ncurrent management of the Southern Ocean fishery and is recognised as a critical \noutput of future ecosystem dynamics models (Constable, 2005). CCAMLR is \ncurrently evaluating ecosystem dynamics models that have been developed to address \nthe allocation of allowable krill catch to SSMUs. These include a model that focuses \non krill and its consumers and specifically considers the effects of uncertainty in key \nprocesses by merging results from Monte Carlo simulations using alternative forms of \nthese functions (Watters et al., 2005). Combining these results with those of entirely \nseparate models that have also been developed to address the same problem will give \na broad measure of the uncertainty associated with predictions. There is therefore a \nreal prospect that ecosystem dynamics models focusing on relevant interactions will \nsoon be used to help manage the impact of fisheries on clearly defined ecosystem \ncomponents. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 62\n \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 63\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS \n \n(1) There is general recognition of the need to manage fisheries in a way that \ncontrols their effects on the wider ecosystem, including effects that are \npropagated through the food-web. This approach will need reliable models of \nthe dynamics of interacting species to inform and evaluate management \nstrategies. \n(2)  A considerable effort has been made to model the characteristics and \ndynamics of key species in the krill-based system of the Southern Ocean, \nespecially in the South Atlantic. Some of these models have addressed the \nfood-web effects of fishing, but none of the multi-species models produced is \ncurrently used in fishery management. \n(3) Krill population dynamics appear to be strongly affected by recruitment \nwhich, in turn, has been linked to various environmental factors. The \nimportance of such factors varies with area and no single factor provides a \nreliable predictor of krill abundance. Transport of krill on ocean currents \nappears to be important in some areas, but the relative influence of transport \nand local production is not known.  \n(4) The spatial structure of the environment is likely to be important in the long-\nterm dynamics of the ecosystem, mediating the outcome of competitive \ninteractions amongst predators. The non-linear relationships between krill \nabundance and its rate of exploitation by both the fishery and predators are \nalso important determinants of ecosystem interactions.  \n(5) Attempts to model the system have suffered from a shortage of empirical data \non trophic relations and rate parameters. Consumption estimates for predators \noften exceed survey estimates of prey abundance, indicating potential \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 64\nproblems with the data. It is therefore necessary to review these datasets \ntogether to determine whether there is a coherent interpretation. \n(6) Models of ecosystem dynamics are required to predict the effects of harvesting \non other parts of the food-web. It is impossible to establish with certainty the \nprecise nature of the food-web interactions that influence these dynamics. \nTherefore it is necessary to develop models, and ways of using them, that are \nrobust to this and other sources of uncertainty. Uncertainty can be represented \nusing the Monte Carlo approach to integrate across alternative parameter \nvalues and model structures. The output can be used to assess the risk \nassociated with candidate management options. \n(7) Models must also be designed to reach a balance between utility and \ncomplexity. This can be achieved by developing models that focus on species \nthat are harvested or monitored, and for which management objectives are set. \nThese models simplify interactions between focal species and other \ncomponents of the ecosystem. Such models will not provide predictions about \nparts of the ecosystem other than the focal species and it is therefore important \nto ensure that management objectives, models and monitoring programs are \nproperly integrated. \n(8) This approach will require data on the trophic relations and population sizes of \nfocal species and identification of the alternative functional relationships for \ninteractions between model components. Improved characterisation of these \nrelationships could potentially be achieved using detailed, possibly individual \nbased, models run separately from management models. There are good diet \ndata sets for monitored species in the Southern Ocean, but the population sizes \nof major consumers should be assessed as a matter of priority. \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 65\n \n \nIX.

Proposed outline for local-scale ecosystem dynamics models to predict the \neffects of krill fishing. The main focal species is krill, which is represented with a \nsize-based model. Local production is determined by recruitment and growth, which \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 88\nmight be affected by environmental factors, predicted by larger scale climate or ocean \nmodels. The krill population will also be affected by transport into and out of the area, \nderived from a large-scale numerical ocean model, and links to other local-scale \nmodels. The krill population is reduced due to catches from legitimate and illegal, \nunregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing. The other focal species are monitored krill \npredators. The reproductive output and survival of these species have functional \nrelationships with the availability of krill and other prey and the abundance of \ninterspecific and intraspecific competitors. Specific models will be needed to derive \nplausible alternative forms of these functional relationships. Populations of monitored \nspecies may migrate to other areas. Grey bubbles show ecosystem characteristics that \ncan be monitored in the real system and should be used to define performance \nmeasures. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed use of local-scale ecosystem dynamics models in a regional-scale \nmodel to evaluate management options. Each local-scale model would incorporate \nseveral alternative representations of important processes. Multiple realisations of the \nmodels would be used to generate probability distributions of monitored parameters \nfor key ecosystem components and economic indicators. These would then be \ncompared with reference points to assess the risk associated with the proposed \nmanagement option. \n \nModels of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. \n 89\nTable 1.
