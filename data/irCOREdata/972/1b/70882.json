A 358, 134-141 (2006).\n1 Introduction\nCoupled oscillatory systems are very common both in nature and in technology. Some-\ntimes the coupling results in synchronization between the oscillations of the two systems\n- an effect first observed between a pair pendulum clocks by Huygens in 1665, while lying\nill in bed. In 1990, Pecora and Carroll (PC) proposed a successful method [1] to syn-\nchronize two identical chaotic systems starting from different initial conditions. The idea\nof synchronization is to use the output of a master system to control a slave system so\nthat the response of the latter follows the output of the master system asymptotically.\nSince then, chaos synchronization has been developed extensively as an important topic\nin its own right nonlinear science. It has been investigated by scientists working in fields\nas different as secure communications, optical, chemical, physical, and biological systems\nand neural networks. The synchronization of chaos has been reported in systems whose\nmodels are identical, similar, and with mismatched-parameters (see [2-6] for reviews).\nThe synchronization of chaos can be induced even in strictly different oscillators [7-9] and\nsystems of different order [10,11]. Nevertheless, given the diversity of phenomena that\nhave been found in chaotic systems [12], there is not yet a clear and exact meaning of the\nsynchronization in chaos. Many distinct kinds of synchronized systems are to be found in\nnature. Examples where we can expect to model synchronization between similar oscilla-\ntors include nephron-nephron synchronization [13] and the mechanical systems [14]. On\nthe other hand, nonidentical systems can be found in the synaptic communication where\nsome neurons with different dynamic models can behave in a synchronous manner [15,16].\nAnother example is the synchronization that occurs between heart and lung, where one\ncan observe that circulatory and respiratory systems synchronize [17], even through they\nare expected to be described by different models. Such facts add to the complexity of\nthe meaning of the chaotic synchronization. In the nonlinear science, the definition of\nthe synchronous behavior means that the trajectories of two or more dynamical systems\nevolve, in some sense, close to one and other along their trajectories.\nAn alternative approach to the understanding of synchronization between chaotic sys-\ntems is to consider the design of the feedback structure: that is, the synthesis of the\n2\nfeedback control needed to synchronize chaotic systems. Efforts have been oriented in\ntwo directions, exploiting the properties of dynamical systems: their observability and\ntheir controllability. In the former case, the reconstruction of the drive system attractor\nfrom the response system is interpreted as an observer [18]. An interesting point about\nthe observability of the synchronization systems is that differential geometry allows one\nto find an invariant space under vector fields where the attractor can be reconstructed\n(see Chapter 1 of [10]). On the other hand, the synchronization of chaotic systems has\nbeen also studied through the design of a controller trying to connect the departures\nof measured variables [7,19-21]. The synchronization is then understood as a stabiliza-\ntion problem and the controllability property is exploited. In other words, the aim is to\ncompute the control input such that the difference between the trajectories of the slave\nsystem y(t) remains close to the trajectories of the master system x(t). That is, the point\nis to find the invariant space such that the origin of the synchronization error system\n\u2016y(t)\u2212 x(t)\u2016 = 0 can be stabilized. The observability and controllability of nonlinear\nsystems are both included within the geometrical control theory [22,23].\nBy the end of 90\u2019s, some efforts had been made to apply the controller approach to\nsynchronize chaotic systems described by different models [15,16,24-29]. The underlying\nidea is to find a synchronization control signal, such that the existence of a synchronization\nmanifold can be assured. In this manner, several synchronization phenomena were found\n[12], and different design techniques were exploited [24-29]. More recently, the synchro-\nnization of chaotic systems of different order was stated as a new problem [10]. The idea\nwas to show that a second-order driven system can be synchronized with the projection\non canonical planes of a third-order chaotic system. A nonlinear feedback interconnection\nwas performed empirically such that synchronization was attained between the Duffing\nequation and the canonical-plane projection of the Chua\u2019s circuit. Of course, since the\norder of the response oscillator is less than the order of the master system, synchroniza-\ntion is only attained in reduced order. The following questions were formulated. Can\nreduced-order synchronization be attained by fourth-order and second-order systems? Can\nreduced-order synchronization be achieved by fourth-order and third-order systems? The\nresults in [11] have shown evidence that synchronization of a fourth-order with a second-\n3\norder system can be achieved. In this sense, the synchronization of the emitter-receiver\nsystem and Duffing equation is achieved in reduced order, i.e., the Duffing equation can be\nsynchronized under feedback actions with the canonical projections of the emitter-receiver\nsystem.\nIn this paper, we discuss in detail chaotic synchronization between fourth-order and\nthird order systems from the perspective of control theory. The master system that\nwe consider is the Matsumoto-Chua-Kobayashi (MCK for short) circuit, while the slave\nsystem is Chua\u2019s circuit. It is known that active control is in general an effective method\nfor bringing about synchronization between two different chaotic systems and this is the\napproach that we adopt in this work. Then, the stability of error signals between the drive\nand response systems is easily proved by adaptive linear control theory. In particular, the\nreduced-order synchronization is interpreted as a stabilization problem. The main idea is\nto design a control loop in the slave system so that the feedbacks steer the states of the\nsynchronization error at the origin, i.e., all the states of the slave system track one part\nof the states of the master system.\nThe paper is presented as follows. In the next section, the reduced-order synchro-\nnization problem is stated. The synchronization strategy is then described in section\n3. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro-\nposed adaptive synchronization methodology in section 4. The text closes with concluding\nremarks in section 5.\nThroughout this paper, \u03bb(W ) denotes an eigenvalue of W , \u03bbmax(W ) and \u03bbmin(W )\nrepresent, respectively, the max[\u03bbi(W )] and the min[\u03bbi(W )], i = 1, . . . , n. |w| represents\nthe absolute value of w, and \u2016W\u2016 represents the Euclidian norm when W is a vector or\nthe induced norm when W is a matrix.\n2 Problem formulation\nThe first system in which we are interested is the MCK circuit, which provided the\nfirst experimental observation of hyperchaos in a real physical system. By considering the\nequations reported in [30], the dynamics of the circuit can be written in non-dimensional\n4\nform: \uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nx\u02d91 = \u03b31(f(x2 \u2212 x1)\u2212 x3),\nx\u02d92 = \u2212\u03b32[f(x2 \u2212 x1) + x4],\nx\u02d93 = \u03b33x1 + \u03b34x3,\nx\u02d94 = \u03b35x2,\n(1)\nwhere the variables x1 and x2 represent the voltages across the two capacitors, while the\nvariables x3 and x4 are the currents through the two conductors, and f is the piecewise\ncontinuous function:\nf(x) = \u03b36x+\n1\n2\n(\u03b37 \u2212 \u03b36)(|x+ 1| \u2212 |x\u2212 1|).\nLet us consider the system\u2019s parameters (see [30]): \u03b31 = 2, \u03b32 = 20, \u03b33 = 1, \u03b34 = 1,\n\u03b35 = 1.5, \u03b36 = 3 and \u03b37 = \u22120.2. This circuit exhibits a typical hyperchaotic behavior\n(see Fig. 1), emphasized by computing the Lyapunov exponents (two of them are positive\n[30]). Initial conditions were arbitrarily located at the origin.\nOur second system is Chua\u2019s circuit, which is a simple and interesting electronic system\nconsisting of one inductor, two capacitors and one piecewise-linear nonlinear resistor. The\nmathematical model equations [31] for this circuit are\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ny\u02d91 = \u03b41(y2 \u2212 y1 \u2212 g(y1))) + u1,\ny\u02d92 = y1 \u2212 y2 + y3 + u2,\ny\u02d93 = \u2212\u03b42y2 + u3,\n(2)\nwhere g(y1) is a piecewise linear function represented by\ng(y1) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u03b33y1 + \u03b44 \u2212 \u03b43, y1 \u2265 1,\n\u03b44y1, |y1| \u2264 1,\n\u03b43y1 \u2212 \u03b44 + \u03b43, y1 \u2264 1,\nIn Eq. (2), variables y1 and y2 represent the voltages across the two capacitors, variable y3\nis the current through the inductor, and u1, u2 and u3 stand for the synchronization forces\n(i.e., the couplings between the master and slave systems such that they are synchronous).\nIt is known that for system parameters \u03b41 = 10, \u03b42 = 14.87, \u03b43 = \u22120.68 and \u03b41 = \u22121.27,\na typical chaotic attractor (a double scroll) can be found in dynamical system (2). The\n5\nchaotic attractor obtained is displayed in Fig. 2 for u1 = u2 = u3 = 0 (uncontrolled\nevolution). Initial conditions were arbitrarily located at the point (y1(0), y2(0), y3(0)) =\n(0.1, 0, 0, 0).\nThere are obviously differences between the attractors of the MCK system and of\nChua\u2019s circuit, i.e., the MCK system and Chua\u2019s circuit are synchronized in neither phase\nnor frequency (see phase portraits in Fig. 2 and projections in Fig. 1). Moreover,\nthere is no synchronization in any sense (see Refs. [12,19] for definitions of different\nkinds of synchronization). Systems (1) and (2) have been widely used to study chaos\nsynchronization when drive and response system are of the same order.\nFollowing the ideas of [10,11], we can now state the synchronization problem as follows:\nTo find scalar driving forces u1, u2 and u3 such that the system (2) is synchronous with\ncanonical projections (reduced-order synchronization) of the MCK system (1) for t > 0\nand any initial conditions (x1(0), x2(0), x3(0), x4(0)) and (y1(0), y2(0), y3(0)).\nIn the next section, the detailed design procedure of the feedback control laws u1, u2\nand u3 is described with detailed explanations.\n3 Adaptive chaos synchronization algorithm\nIn this section, an adaptive control scheme will be developed to attain the synchro-\nnization objective stated above. To this end, let us define the synchronization state errors\nbetween the response system (2) that is to be controlled and the controlling system (1)\nas e1 = y1 \u2212 x1, e2 = y2 \u2212 x2 and e3 = y3 \u2212 x3. Subtracting the second system (2) from\nthe first system (1) which includes the control signals, we obtain\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ne\u02d91 = \u03b41(e2 \u2212 e1) + \u03b6(e1, x1) + \u03c61(x) + u1,\ne\u02d92 = e1 \u2212 e2 + e3 + \u03c62(x) + u2,\ne\u02d94 = \u2212\u03b42e2 + \u03c63(x) + u3,\n(3)\n6\nwhere x = (x1, x2, x3, x4)\nT and\n\u03b6(e1, x1) = \u2212\u03b41g(e1 + x1),\n\u03c61(x) = \u03b41x2 \u2212 \u03b41x1 \u2212 \u03b31f(x2 \u2212 x1) + \u03b31x3,\n\u03c62(x) = x1 \u2212 x2 + x3 + \u03b32(f(x2 \u2212 x1) + x4),\n\u03c63(x) = \u2212\u03b42x2 \u2212 \u03b33x4 \u2212 \u03b34x3,\ncan be interpreted as the action of disturbing forces on the linear part of system (3). The\nsynchronization error to be controlled is thus a nonlinear system with control inputs u1,\nu2 and u3 as a function of the synchronization error states e1, e2 and e3. Eq. (3) may be\nrewritten in the form of a matrix equation:\ne\u02d9 = Ae+ u+B\u03b6(e1, x1) + \u03c6(x), (4)\nwhere e = (e1, e2, e3)\nT , \u03c6(x) = (\u03c61(x), \u03c62(x), \u03c63(x))\nT , u = (u1, u2, u3)\nT ,\nA =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 \u2212\u03b41 \u03b41 01 \u22121 1\n0 \u2212\u03b42 0\n\uf8f9\uf8fb and B =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 10\n0\n\uf8f9\uf8fb .\nThe synchronization problem may thus be formulated as follows: To find the driving force\nu \u2208 R3 such that the discrepancy error e(t) which starts at e0 = e(0) at t0 = 0 tends\nasymptotically to zero as t \u2192 \u221e. Note that the above goal implies that if e(t) \u2192 0 as\nt \u2192 \u221e, then x1(t) \u2192 y1(t), x2(t) \u2192 y2(t) and x3(t) \u2192 y3(t) for all t \u2265 0. In order to do\nso, some necessary assumptions must be made as follows:\nAssumption 1: The nonlinear function \u03b6(e1, x1) is globally Lipschitz, i.e., there exists a\npositive constant k such that\n\u2016\u03b6(e1, x1)\u2212 \u03b6(0, x1)\u2016 \u2264 k\u2016e\u2016, \u2200x1 \u2208 R. (5)\nAssumption 2: For the uncertain nonlinear function \u03c6(x), there exists a positive con-\nstant large enough that\n\u2016\u03c6(x)\u2016 < \u03c6m <\u221e, (6)\nwhere \u03c6m > 0 is an unknown and sufficiently large constant.\nAssumption 3: There exists a constant matrix\nK =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 k1 0 00 k2 0\n0 0 k3\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\n7\nand two positive definite matrices P = P T and Q = QT such that the following algebraic\nequations hold:\n(A\u2212K)TP + P (A\u2212K) = \u2212Q. (7)\nSome comments regarding the above assumptions are in order. Concerning Assump-\ntion 1, the Lipschitz constant k is often required to be known for the control design\npurpose. In fact, it is often difficult to obtain a precise value of k in some practical sys-\ntems, hence the Lipschitz constant is often selected to be larger, which will induce the\ncontrol gain to be higher, and the obtained results would be conservative. Assumption 2 is\nreasonable for the boundness of the chaotic attractor in state space and the interaction of\nall trajectories inside the attractor. Note also that the constant \u03c6m is only introduced to\nprove Theorem 1 later and does not appear in our proposed adaptive feedback controllers:\nwe can suppose that \u03c6m is a constant large enough (i.e., \u03c6m \u2192\u221e) such that Assumption\n2 is always satisfied.\nIf the upper bound of the uncertainty \u03c6(x) is known, i.e. \u03c6m is known a priori,\nthen a robust control law u(t) in (4) can be designed to overcome the effect of unknown\nparametric perturbations, and further to achieve synchronization. The main problem is\nthat \u03c6m is unknown. Therefore, an adaptive robust control law is needed. It may be\ndesigned as follows:\nu = \u22121\n2\n\u03b1e, (8)\nwhere \u03b1 is the estimated feedback gain which is updated on-line by the following adapta-\ntion law:\n\u03b1\u02d9 = \u03b3\u03bbmin(P )\u2016e\u20162. (9)\nin which \u03b3 is a suitable positive constant.\nSubstitution of the adaptive feedback controllers (8) into (4) leads to\ne\u02d9 = Ae+B\u03b6(e1, x1) + \u03c6(x)\u2212 1\n2\n\u03b1e. (10)\nWe can now give our main result.\nTheorem 1 : If Assumptions 1-3 are satisfied, then the slave Chua circuit (2) associated\nwith the adaptive control laws (8)-(9) globally synchronizes the drive MKC system (1) in\nreduced-order, i.e, x1(t)\u2192 y1(t), x2(t)\u2192 y2(t) and x3(t)\u2192 y3(t) as t\u2192\u221e.\n8\nProof: By adding and subtracting the term Ke, the closed-loop system (10) may be\nrewritten as\ne\u02d9 = (A\u2212K)e+Ke+B\u03b6(e1, x1) + \u03c6(x)\u2212 1\n2\n\u03b1e. (11)\nConsider the following Lyapunov function candidate:\nV (t) = eTPe+\n1\n2\u03b3\n(\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1)2, (12)\nwhere P = P T is the positive definite solution of Eq. (7) and \u03b1\u00af is given by\n\u03b1\u00af =\n1\n\u03bbmin(P )\n[\nk2\n\u03b5\n+\n(\u03c6m\u03bbmax(P ))\n2\n\u03b2\n]\n, (13)\nwith \u03b5 and \u03b2 two suitable positive constants. It can easily verify that V (t) is a non-\nnegative function and that it is radically unbounded, i.e., V (t)\u2192 +\u221e as e(t) and (\u03b1\u00af\u2212\u03b1)\n\u2192 +\u221e. The time-derivative of V (t) along the trajectories of system (11) satisfies\nV\u02d9 (t) = eT [(A\u2212K)TP + P (A\u2212K)]e+ 2eTPKe+ 2eTPB\u03b6(e1, x1)\n+ 2eTP\u03c6(x)\u2212 \u03b1eTPe\u2212 1\n\u03b3\n(\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1\u02d9,\n\u2264 \u2212eT (Q\u2212 PK)e+ 2\u2016Pe\u2016 k\u2016e\u2016+ 2\u03c6m\u2016P\u2016 \u2016e\u2016 \u2212 \u03b1\u2016Pe\u20162 \u2212 1\n\u03b3\n(\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1\u02d9.\n(14)\nNotice that\n2\u2016Pe\u2016 k\u2016e\u2016 \u2264 k\n2\n\u03b5\n\u2016Pe\u20162 + \u03b5\u2016e\u20162, (15)\nand\n2\u03c6m\u2016P\u2016 \u2016e\u2016 \u2264 (\u03c6m\u03bbmax(P ))\n2\n\u03b2\n\u2016e\u20162 + \u03b2. (16)\nThen, we get\nV\u02d9 (t) \u2264 \u2212 [\u03bbmin(Q)\u2212 \u03bbmax(PK)\u2212 \u03b5] \u2016e\u20162 +\n[\nk2\n\u03b5\n+\n(\u03c6m\u03bbmax(P ))\n2\n\u03b2\n]\n\u2016e\u20162\n+ \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u03bbmin(P )\u2016e\u20162 \u2212 1\n\u03b3\n(\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1\u02d9\n(17)\nIf we choose \u03b1\u00af as in Eq. (13), then (17) will be\nV\u02d9 (t) \u2264 \u2212 [\u03bbmin(Q)\u2212 \u03bbmax(PK)\u2212 \u03b5] \u2016e\u20162 + \u03b2 + (\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1)\n(\n\u03bbmin(P )\u2016e\u20162 \u2212 \u03b1\u02d9\n\u03b3\n)\n. (18)\nThus, by applying the adaptive law (9), one obtains\nV\u02d9 (t) \u2264 \u2212 [\u03bbmin(Q)\u2212 \u03bbmax(PK)\u2212 \u03b5] \u2016e\u20162 + \u03b2. (19)\n9\nLet us define D = \u03bbmin(Q)\u2212 \u03bbmax(PK)\u2212 \u03b5. Note that the free parameter \u03b5 > 0 can be\nselected to be small enough to let D > 0. From Eq. (19), it follows that if\n\u2016e\u2016 >\n\u221a\n\u03b2\nD\n,\nthen, V\u02d9 (t) < 0, so that V (t) decreases, which implies that \u2016e\u2016 decreases as well (see Eq.\n(12)). It then follows from the standard invariance argument that asymptotically, the\nerror satisfies the bound\n\u2016e\u2016 \u2264 c, (20)\nwhere c \u2265\n\u221a\n\u03b2\nD\n, (see e.g. [32], page 231). From (20), it clearly appears that the asymptotic\nerror depends linearly on the free parameter \u03b2. Hence, if this parameter is small, the\nresulting error will be small as well. The dependence of the error on \u03b5 deserves special\nattention. Note that D = \u03bbmin(Q)\u2212\u03bbmax(PK)\u2212\u03b5. Hence as \u03b5 decreases, D will increase,\nwhich decreases the asymptotic error bound. This argument shows that with the proposed\nmethod, \u03b5 and \u03b2 should be made as small as possible. This implies that the Chua\u2019s system\n(2) associated with the adaptive laws (8), (9) can globally synchronize the drive MCK\nsystem (1) in reduced-order, i.e., x1(t)\u2192 y1(t), x2(t)\u2192 y2(t) and x3(t)\u2192 y3(t) as t\u2192\u221e.\nThis achieves the proof.\n2\nFrom Eq. (13), not only the unknown Lipschitz constant k but also the unknown\nbound \u03c6m can be injected into the constant \u03b1\u00af, which can be adaptively adjusted by the\nadaptation law (9). Further, the global stability of the error dynamics (11) can be ensured\nif the constant \u03b5 is sufficiently small.\n4 Numerical studies\nThis section presents numerical results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nadaptive synchronization scheme. We first select K = I where I is the identity matrix\nof dimension 3 so that the the eigenvalues of matrix A\u2212K are \u221211.8886 and \u22121.0557\u00b1\n3.6951i. The following symmetric and positive-definite matrices\nP =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 0.1478 0.6554 0.01560.6554 6.8845 \u22120.4381\n0.0156 \u22120.4381 0.5619\n\uf8f9\uf8fb and Q =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 2 0 00 2 0\n0 0 2\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\n10\nare selected to satisfy Eq. (7). In this case \u03bbmin(P ) = 0.0774 and \u03bbmax(P ) = 6.9771.\nWithout lost of generality, one can consider that parameters and initial conditions of\nthe master and slave systems have the same values as in Figs. 1 and 2.\nFigure 3 shows the state trajectories of the MCK system (solid line) and of the Chua\u2019s\ncircuit (dashed line). The controller was applied at t = 50. On can see that when u = 0,\nthe trajectories diverge from each other. However, as soon as the adaptive controllers\nare applied, the states x1 and y1, x2 and y2 and x3 and y3 evolve together in an almost\nsynchronous way. This implies that the response MCK system (1) globally synchronizes\nwith the driving Chua\u2019s circuit (2) in spite of the fact that both master and slave systems\nhave different models and orders. Note that the synchronization of systems (1) and (2)\nis attained in phase and practical sense. Under these conditions, one can expect that\nthe double scroll of Chua\u2019s circuit must become the hyperchaotic attractors of the MCK\nsystem. Figure 4 shows the attractors of Chua\u2019s circuit under the action of the adaptive\nfeedback: under the control actions of (8), (9) they have become exact images of the\nhyperchaotic attractors of Fig. 1, the attractors of the MCK system.\nIn order to provide additional evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro-\nposed adaptive synchronization scheme, we show in Fig. 5 the power spectra (PSDs) of\nx1, x2, x3, y1, y2 and y3 under feedback actions. The PSD has been normalized by the\nmaximum amplitude peak in each case. Such a picture shows that, at least, frequency\nand phase synchronization is attained by the adaptive feedback control laws (8), (9). PSD\nis an important measure of synchronization. Although, PSD is not sufficient to conclude\nthat synchronization exists, they provide good evidence [32]. Note that spectra in Chua\u2019s\nequations under control action are similar to than the MCK system (y1, y2, y3) projection.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have presented a robust control scheme for synchronizing fourth-order\nand third-order chaotic systems. In particular, we have demonstrated the matching of the\nChua attractor with the projection on canonical planes of the MCK system. The feedback\ncouplings were designed with a simple algorithm based on an adaptive control strategy of\nchaos suppression. The main advantage of the proposed adaptive synchronization scheme\n11\nis that the bound on uncertainties is unknown. Numerical simulations are given to validate\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed synchronization approach.\n12\nReferences\n[1] Caroll, L. M. and Pecora, T. L. , Phys. Rev.
