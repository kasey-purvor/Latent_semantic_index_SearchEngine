We utilise the high signal-to-noise in these ULX spectra to investigate the best descrip-\ntions of their spectral shape in the 0.3\u201310 keV range. Simple models of an absorbed power-law\nor multicolour disc blackbody prove inadequate at describing the spectra. Better fits are found\nusing a combination of these two components, with both variants of this model - a cool (\u223c 0.2\nkeV) disc blackbody plus hard power-law continuum, and a soft power-law continuum, dom-\ninant at low energies, plus a warm (\u223c 1.7 keV) disc blackbody - providing good fits to 8\/13\nULX spectra. However, by examining the data above 2 keV, we find evidence for curvature\nin the majority of datasets (8\/13 with at least marginal detections), inconsistent with the dom-\ninance of a power-law in this regime. In fact, the most successful empirical description of\nthe spectra proved to be a combination of a cool (\u223c 0.2 keV) classic blackbody spectrum,\nplus a warm disc blackbody, that fits acceptably to 10\/13 ULXs. The best overall fits are pro-\nvided by a physically self-consistent accretion disc plus Comptonised corona model (DISKPN\n+ EQPAIR), which fits acceptably to 11\/13 ULXs. This model provides a physical explana-\ntion for the spectral curvature, namely that it originates in an optically-thick corona, though\nthe accretion disc photons seeding this corona still originate in an apparently cool disc. We\nnote similarities between this fit and models of Galactic black hole binaries at high accre-\ntion rates, most notably the model of Done & Kubota (2005). In this scenario the inner-disc\nand corona become energetically-coupled at high accretion rates, resulting in a cooled accre-\ntion disc and optically-thick corona. We conclude that this analysis of the best spectral data\nfor ULXs shows it to be plausible that the majority of the population are high accretion rate\nstellar-mass (perhaps up to 80-M\u2299) black holes, though we cannot categorically rule out the\npresence of larger,\u223c 1000-M\u2299 intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in individual sources\nwith the current X-ray data.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 black hole physics \u2013 X-rays: binaries \u2013 X-rays:\ngalaxies\n1 INTRODUCTION\nEinstein X-ray observations were the first to reveal point-like, ex-\ntranuclear sources in some nearby galaxies with luminosities in\nexcess of 1039 erg s\u22121 (Fabbiano 1989). Subsequently, many of\nthese so-called Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have dis-\nplayed short and long term variability, which suggests they are\npredominantly accreting objects (see Miller & Colbert 2004 and\nreferences therein). However, the observed luminosities of most\nULXs exceed the Eddington limit for spherical accretion onto a\nstellar-mass (\u223c10-M\u2299) black hole (BH). In fact, their luminosites\nare intermediate between those of normal stellar mass BH X-\nray Binaries (BHBs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). There-\nfore, the accretion of matter onto intermediate-mass black holes\n(IMBHs, of \u223c102\u2013104 M\u2299) provide an attractive explanation for\nULXs, and could represent the long sought-after \u2018missing link\u2019\nbetween stellar mass BHs and the supermassive BHs in the nu-\nclei of galaxies. However, the large populations of ULXs asso-\nciated with sites of active star formation (e.g., in the Cartwheel\ngalaxy, Gao et al. 2003) demand rather too high formation rates\nof IMBHs if they are to explain the ULX class as a whole (King\n2004). An alternative to accreting IMBHs is that ULXs may be a\ntype of stellar-mass BHB with geometrically (King et al. 2001) or\nrelativistically (Ko\u00a8rding, Falcke, & Markoff 2002) beamed emis-\nsion, such that their intrinsic X-ray luminosity does not exceed the\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS\n2 A-M. Stobbart et al.\nEddington limit. Another possibility is that they are stellar-mass\nBHBs that can achieve truly super Eddington luminosities via slim\n(Ebisawa et al. 2003) or radiation pressure dominated (Begelman\n2002) accretion discs.\nAs ULXs are probably the brightest class of X-ray binary\nfueled by the accretion of matter onto a BH1, a knowledge of\nthe properties of Galactic BHBs could be vital in interpreting\ntheir characteristics. Traditionally the X-ray spectra of BHBs have\nbeen fitted empirically with two components, namely a power-\nlaw continuum and a multicolour disc blackbody (MCD) compo-\nnent (Mitsuda et al. 1984; Makishima et al. 1986). In the standard\npicture, the power-law component is thought to represent inverse-\nCompton scattering of thermal photons from the accretion disc by\nhot electrons in a surrounding corona. As such, the power-law rep-\nresents the hard tail of the X-ray emission while the MCD compo-\nnent models the soft X-ray emission from the accretion disc. The\nMCD model itself has been formulated based on the best known\nmodel for accretion onto BHs (i.e., the thin accretion disc model,\nShakura & Sunyaev 1973).\nIt has long been recognised that Galactic BHBs demon-\nstrate various X-ray spectral states which are defined by the bal-\nance of these two components (i.e., power-law and MCD) at any\none time. The three most familiar X-ray bright states are the\nlow\/hard (LH), high\/soft (HS, also described as \u2018thermal domi-\nnated\u2019) and the very high (VH, or \u2018steep power-law\u2019) states (see\nMcClintock & Remillard 2003 for further details). At lower mass\naccretion rates, a BHB usually enters the LH state where their X-ray\nemission is dominated by a hard power-law component (\u0393\u223c1.7),\nthought to arise from Comptonisation of soft photons by a hot\noptically thin corona2. In this state, the disc is either undetected\n(e.g., Belloni et al. 1999) or appears truncated at a much larger in-\nner radius and hence cooler than the parameters derived for the soft\nstate (Wilms et al. 1999, McClintock et al. 2001). The soft X-ray\nstate is generally seen at a higher luminosity (i.e., the HS state)\nand is best explained as \u223c1 keV thermal emission from a multi-\ntemperature accretion disc (i.e., modelled with a MCD component).\nIn this state, the spectrum may also display a hard tail that con-\ntributes a small percentage of the total flux. The VH state is in many\ncases the most luminous state and is characterised by an unbroken\npower-law spectrum extending out to a few hundred keV or more.\nThe photon index is typically steeper (> 2.5) than found in the\nLH state and generally coincides with the onset of strong X-ray\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A MCD component may also\nbe present in the VH state and the EXOSAT era demonstrated that\nsome of the QPOs occur when both disc and power-law compo-\nnents contribute substantial luminosity (van der Klis 1995).\nThe idea of ULXs as analogues to Galactic BHBs in the\nHS state was supported by ASCA observations, which revealed\nthat their 0.5\u201310 keV spectra were successfully fitted with the\nMCD model with relatively high disc temperatures (1.0\u20131.8 keV,\nMakishima et al. 2000). As such, the ULXs were considered to\nbe mass-accreting BHs with the X-ray emission originating in an\noptically-thick accretion disc. In fact, the use of the MCD model to\ndescribe these spectra permits one to obtain an \u2018X-ray\u2013estimated\u2019\n1 Although the most likely reservoir of fuel for an ULX is a companion\nstar, others have been suggested, for example the direct accretion of matter\nfrom molecular clouds (Krolik 2004).\n2 However this is still a topic of debate, with the main alternative for\nthe X-ray power-law emission being synchrotron emission from the ra-\ndio jet that is associated with this state (e.g., Falcke & Biermann 1995;\nMarkoff, Falcke, & Fender 2001).\nBH mass, MXR, from the following equation (cf. Makishima et al.\n2000 equations (5)\u2013(8)).\nMXR =\n\u03be\u03ba2\n8.86\u03b1\nD\u221a\ncosi\n\u221a\nfbol\n2\u03c3T 4in\nM\u2299 (1)\nWhere D is the distance to the X-ray source, which has an\ninclination i, a full bolometric luminosity (from the MCD model)\nof fbol and an observed maximum disc colour temperature Tin. In\naddition \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, \u03ba is the ratio of the\ncolour temperature to the effective temperature (\u2018spectral harden-\ning factor\u2019), and \u03be is a correction factor reflecting the fact that Tin\noccurs at a radius somewhat larger than Rin (here, we assume that\nRin is at the last stable Keplerian orbit). Makishima et al. (2000)\nuse values of \u03be = 0.412 and \u03ba = 1.7, though other work has found\ndifferent values for the spectral hardening factor (e.g. \u03ba = 2.6 for\nGRO J1655-40, Schrader & Titarchuk 2003). Finally, \u03b1 is a posi-\ntive parameter with \u03b1 = 1 corresponding to a Schwarzschild BH.\nHowever, the masses inferred from the ASCA data and Equation\n(1) are far too low to be compatible with the large BH masses\nsuggested by their luminosities (assuming Eddington-limited ac-\ncretion), for standard accretion discs around Schwarzchild BHs.\nMakishima et al. (2000) suggested that this incompatibility could\nbe explained if the BHs were in the Kerr metric (i.e., rapidly ro-\ntating objects), allowing smaller inner disc radii and hence higher\ndisc temperatures.\nChandra observations have provided some support for\nthe Makishima et al. (2000) results, with some ULX spec-\ntra being consistent with the MCD model (e.g., Roberts et al.\n2002). However, Chandra also revealed that some ULX spec-\ntra showed a preference for a power-law continuum rather than\nthe MCD model (e.g., Strickland et al. 2001; Roberts et al. 2004;\nTerashima & Wilson 2004). It has been suggested that this pref-\nerence for a power-law spectrum could be interpreted in terms\nof the LH state seen in Galactic BHB candidates, relativisti-\ncally beamed jets or emission from a Comptonised accretion\ndisc in the VH state. As well as these single component mod-\nels, ASCA and Chandra spectroscopy have also suggested the\npresence of two component spectra for some ULXs, compris-\ning a MCD with a power-law component. For example, previous\nASCA analyses hinted at evidence for IMBHs, i.e., cool accre-\ntion disc components (see below), but these observations were not\nsensitive enough to statistically require two component modelling\n(e.g., Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). Similar results have been ob-\ntained by Chandra, e.g., ULXs in NGC 5408 (Kaaret et al. 2003)\nand NGC 6946 (Roberts & Colbert 2003). Conversely, Chan-\ndra spectra of the Antennae ULXs (Zezas et al. 2002a; Zezas et al.\n2002b) revealed an accretion disc (MCD) component consistent\nwith the high temperature ASCA results (i.e., kTin\u223c1 keV), to-\ngether with a hard power-law component (\u0393\u223c1.2).\nIt is only recently, using high quality XMM-Newton\/EPIC\nspectroscopy of ULXs, that it has been demonstrated that the\naddition of a soft thermal disc component to a power-law con-\ntinuum spectrum provides a strong statistical improvement to\nthe best fitting models to ULX data (e.g., Miller et al. 2003;\nMiller, Fabian, & Miller 2004a). These particular observations\nhave provided strong support for the IMBH hypothesis by reveal-\ning disc temperatures in these sources up to 10 times lower than\ncommonly measured in stellar mass BHBs, consistent with the ex-\npectation for the accretion disc around a \u223c1000-M\u2299 IMBH3 (cf.\n3 It is common for the generic range of masses for IMBHs to be quoted\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\nXMM-Newton observations of the brightest ULXs 3\nEquation (1)). However, in a few cases, XMM-Newton\/EPIC ob-\nservations have revealed a more unusual two-component X-ray\nspectrum. A detailed analysis of such a source is presented in\nStobbart, Roberts, & Warwick (2004). In this case, the ULX is the\nbrightest X-ray source in the nearby (1.78 Mpc) Magellanic-type\ngalaxy NGC 55 and, although its X-ray luminosity only marginally\nexceeds 1039 erg s\u22121, it represents one of the highest quality ULX\ndatasets obtained to date. The initial low flux state data were best\nfitted with an absorbed power-law continuum (\u0393\u223c4), while a sub-\nsequent flux increase was almost entirely due to an additional con-\ntribution at energies> 1 keV, adequately modelled by a MCD com-\nponent (kTin\u223c0.9 keV).\nWhilst this accretion disc component is reasonable for stellar-\nmass BHs, the dominance of the power-law continuum at soft X-\nray energies is problematic. Such a soft power-law cannot repre-\nsent Comptonised emission from a hot corona, as one would not\nexpect to see the coronal component extend down below the peak\nemissivity of the accretion disc, where there would be insufficient\nphotons to seed the corona. Alternative sources of seed photons for\nthe corona are unlikely; for example, the incident photon flux of the\nsecondary star at the inner regions of the accretion disc is too low to\nprovide the seeding (cf. Roberts et al. 2005). It also seems unlikely\nthat the power-law emission could arise from processes at the base\nof a jet, as these are typically represented by much harder photon\nindices than measured here (\u0393\u223c1.5\u20132; Markoff et al. 2005 and ref-\nerences therein). Indeed, with the possible exception of NGC 5408\nX-1 (Kaaret et al. 2003), there is no evidence that ULXs do display\nbright radio jets, though this cannot be excluded by current obser-\nvations (Ko\u00a8rding et al. 2005). The possibility of the soft component\nresulting from an outflow of material from the accretion disc may\nalso be discounted as this would produce a thermal spectrum rather\nthan a power-law continuum.\nAlthough this spectral description has not been seen in Galac-\ntic systems, a second case has been reported independently for the\nnearest persistent extragalactic ULX (M33 X-8) by Foschini et al.\n(2004). The non-standard model provided the best fit to this ULX\nwith \u0393\u223c2.5 and kTin\u223c1.2 keV. However, this source is also at the\nlow luminosity end of the ULX regime with LX \u223c2\u00d71039 erg s\u22121.\nA further possible case, in a more luminous ULX, has arisen from\nthe XMM-Newton data analysis of NGC 5204 X-1 (Roberts et al.\n2005). In this case the authors show that there is spectral ambi-\nguity between the non-standard fit (\u0393\u223c3.3, kTin\u223c 2.2 keV) and\nthe IMBH model (\u0393\u223c2.0, kTin\u223c 0.2 keV), with both providing\nstatistically acceptable fits to the data. Even more recently, two ad-\nditional examples of this spectral form have been uncovered in an\nXMM-Newton survey of ULXs by Feng & Kaaret (2005).\nAlthough it is difficult to derive a literal physical interpretation\nfrom the non-standard model, it does provide an accurate empirical\ndescription of ULX spectra in some cases, and as such it has the\npotential to provide new insights into the nature of these sources.\nTherefore in this paper we re-evaluate current data in an attempt to\ndetermine the best spectral description for the shape of high qual-\nity ULX spectra, and ask what consequences this has for the idea\nas 20\u2013106 M\u2299 . The lower limit comes from a consideration of the mea-\nsured masses of BHs in our own Galaxy (McClintock & Remillard 2003),\nand a theoretical limit for the mass of a BH formed from a single massive\nstar (Fryer & Kalogera 2001). However, more recent population synthesis\nanalyses show that BHs of up to \u223c 80-M\u2299 may be formed in young stel-\nlar populations (Belczynski et al. 2004). Hence, when we refer to IMBHs\nin this paper we refer specifically to the larger \u223c1000-M\u2299 IMBHs implied\nby the cool accretion disc measurements.\nof ULXs as accreting IMBHs. The paper is structured as follows:\nSec. 2 \u2013 introduction to the ULX sample; Sec. 3 \u2013 details of the\nobservations and data reduction; Sec. 4 \u2013 description of the spec-\ntral analysis; Sec. 5 \u2013 a comment on the luminosity and inner disc\ntemperature relationship of these ULXs; Sec. 6 \u2013 a discussion of\nour results; and finally Sec. 7 \u2013 our conclusions.\n2 THE SAMPLE\nAs our primary goal is to find the best description(s) of the shape\nof ULX spectra, only the highest quality datasets were chosen.\nThe ULXs were initially selected from the ROSAT catalogues of\nRoberts & Warwick (2000) and Colbert & Ptak (2002) to provide a\nlist of historically-bright ULXs that are resolved at a spatial resolu-\ntion similar to XMM-Newton4. We applied a source selection crite-\nria of observed count rates of > 10 counts ks\u22121 in the ROSAT HRI\ncamera, combined with > 10 ks of XMM-Newton\/EPIC data avail-\nable in the archive by December 2004, to select ten ULXs with\npotentially sufficient counts for very detailed spectral analysis. In\naddition, we included three more high quality ULX datasets: pro-\nprietary data for Holmberg II X-1 (hereafter Ho II X-1), and two\nsources not quite bright enough in the ROSAT bandpass to be clas-\nsified as ULXs, namely the ULX in NGC 55 and M33 X-8. Whilst\nsome of the sources in this sample have been observed more than\nonce, we have only selected the longest individual exposure in each\ncase to provide the clearest single view of their spectra. Our fi-\nnal sample of 13 sources from 12 different galaxies is listed in Ta-\nble 1. The selected ULXs are located at distances of between 800\nkpc and 17.8 Mpc, possess XMM-Newton count rates between 0.1\nand 8.9 count s\u22121 and cover the full range of ULX luminosities\n(\u223c1039 erg s\u22121\u2013 few \u00d71040 erg s\u22121). Hereafter we refer to the\nsources by their names as given in column (1) of Table 1.\n3 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\nIn this work we have utilised data from the EPIC cameras on\nboard XMM-Newton (Turner et al. 2001; Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001). The\ndatasets were obtained through the XMM-Newton public data\narchive (excluding proprietary Ho II X-1 data) and details of the\nobservations are shown in Table 2. The data were processed and\nreduced using the standard tools of XMM-SAS software v.6.0.0. In\nsome cases the observations were affected by soft proton flaring for\nwhich preliminary cleaning was necessary. For these observations\nwe extracted full field X-ray (0.3\u201310 keV) light curves and screened\nfor flaring using Good Time Interval (GTI) files based on either a\ntime or count rate criterion. The NGC 55 ULX and NGC 5204 X-1\nobservations were not affected by flaring episodes. The NGC 2403\nX-1 observation was only affected by flaring at the end of the expo-\nsure (the last\u223c20 ks), therefore we used a time selection to exclude\nthis flaring event. For the remaining sources we used a count rate\ncut-off criterion to produce a GTI file. The exact value of the cut-off\nwas allowed to vary from field-to-field, to provide the best compro-\nmise in each case between excluding high background periods and\nfacilitating the longest available exposure on the ULX. In practise\nthe actual cut-off values varied in the 6.5\u201317.5 count s\u22121 (0.3\u201310\nkeV) range. In all cases we used only those data recorded when the\n4 The ROSAT lists were deemed appropriate as most bright ULXs are per-\nsistent and vary by factors of no more than 2\u20133 in flux over a baseline of\nyears, cf.

The background\nwas taken from a circular region, near to the source in the pn camera\nand at the same distance from the readout node. The chosen back-\nground regions were the same in all three detectors where obser-\nvations were taken using the full-frame observing mode. However,\nin three cases the MOS cameras were operated in either the large-\nwindow or small-window mode, so here we used a background re-\ngion closest to the one used for the pn extraction. The size of the\nsource and background spectral extraction regions are listed in Ta-\nble 3.\nFor the pn camera the spectra were extracted using event pat-\nterns 0\u20134, which allows \u2018single\u2019 and \u2018double\u2019 pixel events. We also\nset \u2018FLAG=0\u2019 to exclude all events at the edge of the CCD and\nevents from bad pixels. For the MOS detectors we used event pat-\nterns 0\u201312 which allows \u2018single\u2019, \u2018double\u2019, \u2018triple\u2019 and \u2018quadruple\u2019\npixel events. We employed a less conservative screening criterion\nfor the MOS data by using the flag expression #XMMEA EM to ex-\nclude hot pixels and events outside of the field of view. The SAS\ntask especget was used to produce source and background spectra\nfor each ULX, together with the appropriate Redistribution Ma-\ntrix File (RMF) and Ancilliary Response File (ARF). Spectral files\nwere grouped to require at least 20 counts bin\u22121 before fitting, to\nensure Gaussian statistics.\nModel spectra were fitted to the data using the HEAsoft X-\nray spectral fitting package XSPEC (v.11.3.0). The pn, MOS-1 and\nMOS-2 spectra for each object were fitted simultaneously, but we\nincluded constant multiplicative factors in each model to allow for\ncalibration differences between the cameras. This value was frozen\nat unity for the pn data and allowed to vary for the MOS detectors,\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\nXMM-Newton observations of the brightest ULXs 5\nTable 2.

Quoted fluxes\nare an average of the three measurements.\nSpectra were initially fitted in the 0.3\u201310 keV band. However,\nin several cases we found that the data below 0.5 keV did not agree\nwith any of the models we tried, leaving large residuals (particu-\nlarly with respect to the pn data) to the best fits. We note that the\ndatasets with this problem \u2013 NGC 55 ULX, NGC 1313 X-1 & X-2\nand NGC 3628 X-1 \u2013 were all obtained in the years 2000\u20132001 (in\nfact M33 X-8 is the only observation from this epoch without these\nfitting residuals). At first glance this would appear to be a problem\nwith the calibration at early mission times; however the pn cali-\nbration at least has remained remarkably static in orbit (EPIC team,\npriv. comm.). As we cannot explain this variation we conservatively\nexcluded these data in all EPIC cameras, such that spectral fitting\nwas restricted to the 0.5\u201310 keV range in these four cases. Also, in\nthe case of Ho II X-1 there is a possible pn calibration feature that\nis particularly prominent at low energies (Goad et al. 2006), there-\nfore we followed the method of these authors and excluded the pn\ndata below 0.7 keV to account for this, whilst retaining MOS data\ndown to 0.3 keV.\nThe X-ray spectra were modified for absorption follow-\ning Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992), assuming the solar\nabundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) (i.e., the WABS compo-\nnent in XSPEC). We used two absorption components, one of which\nwas fixed for each source to represent the appropriate foreground\ncolumn density through our Galaxy (Dickey & Lockman 1990 \u2013\nsee Table 1), and the second component was left free to fit the data\nto represent additional absorption within the host galaxy and\/or in-\ntrinsic to the ULX. The errors quoted in this work are at the 90%\nconfidence level for one interesting parameter. Throughout this\nanalysis we distinguish statistically acceptable fits from unaccept-\nable fits using a fixed criterion of Prej < 95 per cent, where Prej\nis the probability of rejection derived directly from the \u03c72 statistic\nfor the spectral fit.\nTable 3.

We tried the two models most often used in the past as\nsingle-component descriptions of ULX spectra, namely a power-\nlaw continuum model and the canonical MCD model. The details of\nthese fits are given in Table 4 and the quality of the X-ray spectra is\nillustrated using the power-law fits in Figure 1. Due to the excellent\nspectral quality, we were able to reject the power-law model in 8\nout of the 13 cases at > 95% confidence. Interestingly, the five\nULXs for which a power-law is an adequate description of the data\n(NGC 1313 X-1 & X-2, M83 ULX, NGC 4861 ULX, NGC 5204\nX-1) include the three poorest quality datasets.

More specifically, we began by testing the standard IMBH\nmodel, i.e., a cool accretion disc plus power-law continuum model.\nThis spectral description improved on the simple models by provid-\ning acceptable fits to 8 sources (NGC 1313 X-1 & X-2, M81 X-9,\nNGC 3628 X-1, NGC 4559 X-1, NGC 4861 ULX, NGC 5204 X-1,\nM83 ULX), with 0.1 keV < kTin < 0.3 keV and 1.6 < \u0393 < 2.5\n(Table 5). As with previously published work, these disc tempera-\ntures are broadly consistent with IMBHs of around \u223c1000-M\u2299 in\nsize, though the power-law slopes are puzzlingly shallow for what\nare supposed HS (or VH state) sources (see Roberts et al. 2005 for\nfurther discussion). In all cases the 0.3\u201310 keV flux is dominated\nby the power-law component.\nWe then attempted to fit the X-ray spectra with the non-\nstandard model i.e., with the power-law component dominant at\nsoft energies.

The balance in 0.3\u201310 keV flux\nbetween the two components was much more varied for this model,\nthough most sources showed a relatively equitable balance (ratios\nof no more than 3:1 in either direction, and \u223c1:1 in five cases).\nIn total, the power-law + MCD combination could not be re-\njected at > 95 per cent confidence for 10\/13 sources in the sam-\nple. Two of these sources were unambiguously best fitted with the\nIMBH model (NGC 1313 X-1, M81 X-9) while two more were\nbest fitted by the non-standard model (M33 X-8, NGC 2403 X-1).\nStatistically acceptable fits existed for both models for the remain-\ning six sources. Three sources in this sample (NGC 55 ULX, Ho II\nX-1 and NGC 4395) rejected both models at > 95 percent confi-\ndence, although a comparison of the fits show that the spectrum of\nthe NGC 55 ULX appeared to fit much better to the non-standard\nmodel, whilst Ho II X-1 and NGC 4395 X-1 much preferred the\nIMBH model.\nThis sample of high quality ULX datasets demonstrates spec-\ntral ambiguity for six sources (NGC 1313 X-2, NGC 3628 X-1,\nNGC 4559 X-1, NGC 4861 ULX, NGC 5204 X-1, M83 ULX).\nAs Roberts et al. (2005) suggest, a key discriminator between the\nmodels could be a test for spectral curvature at high energies (> 2\nkeV). Curvature is not expected in the IMBH model where the\npower-law component is dominant above 2 keV, whereas sources\nbest-fitted by the non-standard model have the curved MCD com-\nponent dominant at these hard X-ray energies. We therefore at-\ntempted to fit the high energy (2\u201310 keV) ULX spectra with a\nbroken power-law model. For comparison we also fitted the 2\u201310\nkeV ULX spectra with a single power-law component, as shown\nin Table 6. We did not include absorption in the fit in either case,\nas single- and two-component fits generally limit absorption to\n\u223c< 4 \u00d7 10\n21 atoms cm\u22122, which should not strongly affect the\ndata above 2 keV. When we do include absorption in these fits\nwe actually measure far higher columns in several cases, which is\nphysically unrealistic (and may be a result of the absorption com-\npensating for intrinsic curvature). The results of the broken power-\nlaw spectral fits, together with the statistical probability of the fit\nimprovement over the single power-law fits (using the F-test) are\nshown in Table 7.\nTo demonstrate the validity of this method, the two sources\nwith unambiguous non-standard fits (M33 X-8 and NGC 2403 X-\n1), plus NGC 55 ULX which clearly prefers this model, show unac-\nceptable power-law fits that are made acceptable by the inclusion of\na break. In these cases the improvement is highly statistically sig-\nnificant (> 9\u03c3 improvement over a simple power-law fit accord-\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\nXMM-Newton observations of the brightest ULXs 9\nTable 5.

Stobbart et al.\ning to the F-test). However, these were the clearest-cut cases. Of\nthe ambiguous spectra, three out of six showed evidence for curva-\nture. This was marginal in the case of M83 ULX (> 2\u03c3 level), but\nmore significant for NGC 4559 X-1 and NGC 5204 X-1 (> 3\u03c3),\nwith the latter case having an unacceptable power-law fit. Most in-\nterestingly, though, one of the IMBH-fit sources (NGC 1313 X-1)\nshows evidence for curvature (> 3\u03c3 improvement), whilst Ho II X-\n1 also shows a significant break (> 4\u03c3 improvement). In total 8\/13\nsources show at least marginal evidence for curvature at the high\nenergy end of their XMM-Newton spectrum. This is strongly sug-\ngestive that the majority of sources are not dominated by a power-\nlaw continuum at these energies, such as one might expect to see\nif the X-ray emission arises from the optically thin, hot corona as-\nsumed in the IMBH model.\n4.3 Dual thermal models\nIn the above analysis we determine that there is (at least marginal)\nevidence of curvature above 2 keV in the majority of our sources,\narguing that a power-law continuum is not an adequate description\nof this emission, while the hotter accretion disc present in the al-\nternate model may be more appropriate. The situation below 2 keV\nis less clear cut. Though the alternate model uses a power-law con-\ntinuum to describe the soft component, this is modified to appear\ncurved by absorption. As this power-law emission is difficult to un-\nderstand physically we have therefore explored a new variation of\nthe alternate model in which the soft component is also intrinsically\ncurved (i.e., it does not rely solely on absorption to produce the ob-\nserved curvature). In this model we fitted a cool blackbody (BB)\ncontinuum to the soft component, and a MCD to the hard compo-\nnent. The physical motivation for the soft component comes from\nthe suggestion that optically-thick outflowing winds from BHs ac-\ncreting at or above the Eddington limit could explain ultrasoft com-\nponents in ULXs (King & Pounds 2003). Such winds would appear\nas BB continua with temperatures of\u223c0.1\u20130.3 keV. One might then\nobserve emission from both the accretion disc and the wind given\na favourable accretion disc geometry and viewing angle (A. King,\npriv. comm.)5.\nThe results of applying this new model to the data are shown\nin Table 5. It proved to be the most successful empirical descrip-\ntion of the data, providing statistically acceptable fits to 10 out of\nthe 13 sources, with 0.15 keV < kT < 0.3 keV and 0.8 keV\n< kTin < 2.2 keV (excluding NGC 3628 X-1 for which the\ntemperatures are much higher than shown in the other sources,\ni.e., kT\u223c0.6 keV and kTin\u223c4.3 keV). This model provided the\nonly acceptable empirical fit to the ULX in NGC 55, and all six am-\nbiguous sources are adequately described by this model. Curiously,\nthis is also true for both IMBH sources (though it does provide a\nnotably worse fit than the IMBH model for M 81 X-9), and for one\nof the two non-standard model sources (NGC 2403 X-1). However,\nthis model could not provide statistically acceptable fits to the other\nnon-standard source (M 33 X-8) or to the final two ULXs (Ho II X-\n1 & NGC 4395 X-1, which also do not fit well with the power-law\n+ MCD combination).\n5 Miller et al. (2004a) argue that cool, optically-thick outflows cannot ex-\nplain the soft excess in ULXs as it would be impossible to form powerful\nenough shocks to produce a luminous non-thermal power-law continuum\ncomponent in such systems. If the hard component is not a power-law, but\ninstead originates directly from the accretion disc, then the requirement for\nshocks to be present is removed and their argument is circumvented.\nFigure 2.

Also shown are the individual additive model\ncomponents: solid line\u2013PO, dotted line\u2013MEKAL.\n4.4 Why do Ho II X-1 and NGC 4395 X-1 not conform?\nAs shown in the previous sections, statistically acceptable fits for\nHo II X-1 and NGC 4395 X-1 cannot be found using the chosen\ntwo-component models. Interestingly, these are two of the softest\nsources in the sample which means that their X-ray spectra are rel-\natively dominated by < 1 keV emission, where it is most sensitive\nto absorption characteristics (cf. Fig. 1). The analysis of an RGS\nspectrum of Ho II X-1 by Goad et al. (2006) revealed that its X-\nray emission is subject to absorption by a medium with a sub-solar\noxygen abundance. The mis-modelling of absorption, in combina-\ntion with the exceptionally high signal to noise EPIC spectrum of\nHo II X-1, may be responsible for the lack of a good fit to this\nULX in our analysis. However, even after correcting for the sub-\nsolar abundance absorption acting on Ho II X-1, Goad et al. (2006)\nstill did not find acceptable fits using the canonical power-law +\nMCD model. Instead, a statistically acceptable solution to the spec-\ntrum was found through using a more physical model, namely the\nDISKPN + COMPTT combination. We explore the utility of a similar\nmodel in describing our whole dataset in the next section.\nIn the case of NGC 4395 X-1, a further inspection of the resid-\nuals to a simple power-law fit does suggest some structure, notably\nincluding a smooth \u2018hump\u2019 at \u223c1 keV, which is unlike the fea-\ntureless X-ray spectra of the other ULXs. Therefore we tried a fit\nincluding a MEKAL component (nominally representing the emis-\nsion spectrum from hot, collisionally-ionised gas) in addition to a\npower-law continuum to model this spectrum. The result is shown\nin Table 8. This model does indeed provide the best (and only statis-\ntically accceptable) fit to NGC 4395 X-1 with \u03c72\/dof = 397.5\/366.\nThe model fitted to the pn count rate spectrum is shown in Fig. 2, as\nwell as the individual additive model components. From this figure,\none can clearly see how the MEKAL component effectively models\nthe emission hump at \u223c 1 keV. Using a fixed solar-abundance ab-\nsorber, we find the temperature of the MEKAL component is \u223c0.75\nkeV, while the photon index is quite steep at \u0393 \u223c 4.\nMEKAL components have been reported in the spectral fits of a\nsmall number of ULXs. In fact, two other ULXs within this sample\nhave been described thus in previous analyses, namely Ho II X-\n1 based on joint ROSAT - ASCA fits (Miyaji, Lehmann & Hasinger\n2001), and NGC 4559 X-1 based on one of two Chandra obser-\nvations (Roberts et al. 2004). We have investigated whether such\nMEKAL + power-law models can be applied to the current data for\nthese sources, and show the results in Table 8.

Stobbart et al.\nrejected for Ho II X-1, though it is notable that the quality of the fit\nis very close to that of the best empirical description of the source\n(cool MCD plus power-law). In this case the temperature of the\nMEKAL is again relatively high at \u223c 0.66 keV, but the contribu-\ntion of this component is minimal (\u223c 3 per cent of the 0.3\u201310 keV\nflux)6. This is both far hotter and far fainter than the \u223c 0.3 keV\nthermal plasma that composed 20 - 30 per cent of the 0.5\u20132 keV\nemission modelled by Miyaji et al. (2001). On the other hand, the\ntemperature of the best-fitting MEKAL to NGC 4559 X-1 is lower,\nat\u223c 0.25 keV, but it does constitute part of a statistically-acceptable\nfit to the data. This temperature is similar to the\u223c 0.18 keV plasma\ninferred by Roberts et al. (2004). We note that this latter result just\nadds to the spectral ambiguity already seen in the case of this ULX.\nFinally, if NGC 4395 X-1 really does possess an X-ray line-\nemitting component, what is its physical origin? Several ideas have\nbeen put forward to explain such a component in the spectrum\nof an ULX. Miyaji et al. (2001) suggest the presence of a young\nsupernova remnant coincident with Ho II X-1, a theme expanded\non by Feng & Kaaret (2005). Indeed, these authors independently\nconfirm the presence of the MEKAL component in the spectrum of\nNGC 4395 X-1, and find two further ULXs with similar character-\nistics. Alternately, as Roberts et al. (2004) find the MEKAL compo-\nnent in NGC 4559 X-1 to switch on between two Chandra obser-\nvations separated by\u223c 5 months, they suggest that the plasma may\noriginate in the collision of a jet or outflow from the ULX with\na denser medium in the close proximity of the system. A second\nalternative is offered by Terashima & Wilson (2004), who suggest\nthat emission lines in the spectrum of an ULX in M51 may orig-\ninate from a photoionised stellar wind, similar to what is seen in\nsome high-mass X-ray binaries in our own Galaxy. A final point of\ninterest is that a broad \u223c 1 keV feature, similar to that driving the\nMEKAL fit in NGC 4395 X-1, has recently been seen in the XMM-\nNewton spectrum of GRS 1915+105 by Martocchia et al. (2005)\n(although see their paper for caveats). One intriguing possibility\nis that this feature could originate in a disc wind. Clearly ULXs\npossessing MEKAL components in their spectra are an interesting\nsubject in their own right, and should be the subject of future atten-\ntion.\n4.5 Physical models\nThe success of the COMPTT model in describing the spectra of\nsome ULXs (e.g. Miller et al. 2003, Goad et al. 2006) shows that\na Comptonised spectrum is in principle another viable alternative.\nThe COMPTT model however, is not fully self-consistent e.g., it\nallows spectra to have temperatures higher than expected when\nCompton cooling is taken into account. We therefore attempted to\nfit a more physical model to the ULX spectra, namely the EQPAIR\nmodel (Coppi 1999), which allows thermal and non thermal elec-\ntron distributions. In our modelling, we assume a purely thermal\nelectron distribution, the temperature of which is computed self-\nconsistently by balancing heating and cooling (the latter of which\nis mainly due to Compton cooling). A key parameter of this model\nis the ratio lh\/ls, where lh and ls represent the compactness of the\nelectrons and the compactness of the seed photon distribution re-\nspectively. This ratio depends on the geometry of the source as well\n6 The contribution of the MEKAL is so small that its parameterisation is\nrelatively insensitive to changes in metallicity. For example, setting a low\nabundance (as found by Miyaji et al. 2001) leaves the temperature of the\nMEKAL unchanged at \u223c 0.66 keV.\nas the internal mechanisms, and it provides the dominant influence\non the spectral shape. The source geometry assumed is either spher-\nical or a disc-corona (slab) geometry. Low energy (UV or X-ray)\nthermal photons from the accretion disc are assumed to be emit-\nted uniformly inside the source region for the spherical models and\nenter from the base of the corona in the slab geometry. We take\nthe seed photons to have an accretion disc spectrum as described\nwith the DISKPN model of Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. (1999), with the inner\nedge of the disc at 6GM\/c2. This model assumes a proper general\nrelativistic potential and has a characteristic temperature kTbb. To\nallow for a patchy Compton corona, we add a second DISKPN com-\nponent to the model, with the temperature coupled to that of the\nEQPAIR seed photons.\nThis model ultimately proved the best description of the ULX\nspectra in our sample, with statistically acceptable fits to 11\/13\ndatasets, all with similar or improved goodness of fits compared to\nthe best empirical modelling, for only one extra degree of freedom.\nOnly Ho II X-1 and NGC 4395 X-1 were rejected at > 95 per cent\nconfidence (see Table 9), although in the case of Ho II X-1 it does\nprovide clearly the best fit of all that were attempted to the data,\nand is only marginally rejected (Prej \u2248 97.7 per cent). Again the\nfit to NGC 4395 X-1 is poor, for reasons explained in the previous\nsection.\nThe fits provide a uniformly low measurement of the disc tem-\nperature across the sample, in the range 0.07 < kTmax < 0.29.\nTaken in isolation, this might be interpreted as strong support for\nthe presence of IMBHs in ULXs. However, many of the fits show a\nsecond remakable characteristic, which is that the optical depth of\nthe coronae appear to be very high, ranging from \u03c4 \u223c 8 for Ho II\nX-1 up to depths well in excess of 30 (NGC 55 ULX, NGC 2403 X-\n1)7. Importantly, this result gives a physical explanation for the cur-\nvature noted to be present in the spectra in previous sections. This\nsecond characteristic appears irreconcilable with the main assump-\ntion behind the IMBH model, which is that they operate as simple\nscaled-up BHBs (see also Goad et al. 2006), as such sources typi-\ncally do not possess very optically-thick coronae. This result must\ntherefore strongly challenge the IMBH interpretation for the nine\nULXs (including Ho II X-1) well-described by this model. How-\never, three ULXs - NGC 1313 X-1, M81 X-9 and (possibly) NGC\n3628 X-1 - may still possess optically-thin coronae, and as such\nremain viable IMBH candidates.\nAs this spectral model provides at least the same goodness of\nfit as the empirical models in all but one case, we used these fits to\ndetermine the observed X-ray flux. Due to uncertainties in the low\nenergy spectrum of some ULXs, the spectral fitting was restricted\nto 0.5\u201310 keV (and in the case of Ho II X-1 the pn data was re-\nstricted to 0.7\u201310 keV) instead of the 0.3\u201310 keV range adopted\nfor the other sources. Therefore to determine the absorbed X-ray\nflux of each ULX over the same energy range, we created a dummy\nresponse matrix in XSPEC over the 0.3\u201310 keV energy range for\nthose cases with calibration uncertainties. This dummy response\ntemporarily supersedes the response matrix used in the spectral fit-\nting of those sources, allowing us to examine the behaviour of the\nDISKPN+EQPAIR model over this energy range.

These authors selected a sample of ULXs with pub-\nlished estimates of LX > 1040 erg s\u22121, that require a soft excess\ncomponent (at least at the 3\u03c3 confidence level) in the low energy\npart of a two component X-ray spectrum. They then compared the\ninferred disc temperatures (taken from the soft component) and un-\nabsorbed luminosities (0.5\u201310 keV) of their ULXs to those of a\nnumber of Galactic BHBs, and found that these ULXs and stellar\nmass BHBs occupy distinct regions of a LX \u2013 kT diagram. More\nspecifically, the ULXs are more luminous but have cooler thermal\ndisc components than standard stellar-mass BHBs, consistent with\nthe ULXs harbouring IMBHs.\nFollowing on from this work, we have reproduced LX \u2013 kT\ndiagrams, based on the inferred unabsorbed 0.5\u201310 keV X-ray lu-\nminosities for ULXs in this sample (Fig. 3). However, we do this\nfor two cases: (i) disc temperatures measured from the IMBH (cool\ndisc + hard power-law) fits; and (ii) disc temperatures taken from\nthe dual thermal (cool blackbody + warm disc) fits. In both cases\nwe only show sources where the spectral fits are statistically ac-\nceptable, and the fit parameters are well constrained. For this rea-\n8 Although the power-law + MEKAL spectral model statistically provided\nthe best fit to NGC 4395 X-1, the measured source flux derived from this\nmodel and the DISKPN+EQPAIR model were in close agreement. For con-\nsistency, we quote the value from the DISKPN+EQPAIR model. However, as\nthe ULX lay on a hot column in the pn data we simply use the average of\nthe two MOS flux measurements to estimate its luminosity.\nson, we excluded the values from the IMBH fit to M83 ULX, as the\ndisc temperature is unconstrained in this case. Additionally, NGC\n3628 X-1 does not appear on either plot as its unusual disc tempera-\ntures place it outside the range displayed in both cases. In each case\nthe luminosity was derived from an average of the unabsorbed flux\n(0.5\u201310 keV) from each detector. The errors on the disc temperature\nare 90 per cent confidence errors, likewise the luminosity errors are\nbased on the 90 per cent confidence errors in the average measured\nflux, as calculated by XSPEC. Finally, we illustrate the regions of\nparameter space occupied by the BHBs and ULXs in Miller et al.\n(2004b) by ellipses, with the ellipse representing IMBH-candidate\nULXs at the upper-left.\nThe two LX \u2013 kT diagrams in Fig. 3 tell very different stories.\nAs would be expected, our IMBH model results reproduce those of\nMiller et al. (2004b), i.e., the ULXs occupy a very different region\nof parameter space to the stellar-mass BHBs, consistent with larger\nblack holes and hence more luminous, cooler accretion discs. How-\never, the dual thermal model disc temperatures suggest an alterna-\ntive interpretation. In this case, the ULXs appear to be a direct, high\nluminosity extension of the BHB class, and follow the LX \u221d T 4\ntrend one would expect from standard accretion discs. Obviously\none cannot conclude which is the correct interpretation on the ba-\nsis of these plots. However, it does demonstrate very clearly that\nit is the choice of empirical model used to determine the charac-\nteristics of ULX spectra that governs whether one concludes that\nsome ULXs contain IMBHs, or whether they are more similar to\nstellar-mass BHBs.\n6 DISCUSSION\nIn this work we have analysed the X-ray spectra of a small sample\nof 13 ULXs, that constituted the highest quality (i.e. most photon-\nrich) datasets in the XMM-Newton data holdings as of December\n2004. We demonstrate that the superior collecting area of XMM-\nNewton over its rivals leads to better spectral definition, primarily\nthrough the rejection of simple single-component spectral models\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\n14 A-M. Stobbart et al.\nFigure 3. Unabsorbed X-ray luminosity (0.5\u201310 keV) plotted against ac-\ncretion disc temperatures inferred from the X-ray spectral fits (as per\nMiller et al. 2004b). The ellipses represent the regions occupied by ULXs\n(small ellipse) and Galactic BHCs (large ellipse) presented in Figure 2 of\nMiller et al. (2004b). The values of the data points displayed in these fig-\nures are derived from the IMBH spectral fits (top panel) or the dual ther-\nmal model fits (bottom panel), for sources with statistically acceptable and\nwell constrained fits for that model. (NOTE: IMBH data points neglect M83\nULX, which has an unconstrained temperature, and NGC 3628 X-1 which\nhas a lower temperature than the other sources [\u223c80 eV]; dual thermal data\npoints also neglect NGC 3628 X-1 which has a much higher temperature\nthan the other sources [\u223c4 keV])\n(power-law, MCD) that have adequately described previous spec-\ntra of many of these ULXs. However, we are still photon-limited\nin many of these spectra, to the extent that in six cases we are un-\nable to tell whether a combination of a MCD plus a power-law\nuniquely fits the data with the MCD component at the low or the\nhigh energy end of the X-ray spectrum. In each of these six ambigu-\nous spectra, we accumulated no more than \u223c 18000 EPIC counts\n(pn and MOS combined). In each spectrum that we resolved this\nsimple ambiguity, or excluded both cases as unacceptable fits, we\nhad > 20000 EPIC counts (excluding NGC 4395 X-1, as this had\nboth an atypical spectrum and an underestimated pn count rate due\nto its location on a hot column). Even then, the introduction of a\nmodel composed of two thermal components adds an extra layer of\nambiguity to many of the datasets. This suggests that one requires\nvery photon-rich datasets to make progress in descriptive empirical\nXMM-Newton ULX spectroscopy, equivalent to at least 100-ks of\nflare-free data for a 0.2 count s\u22121 on-axis ULX observed by the\nEPIC cameras, and spectral results from poorer quality data should\nbe regarded with caution.\nIssues of spectral ambiguity aside, perhaps our most interest-\ning result is the probable detection of curvature in the high-energy\npart of the XMM-Newton EPIC spectrum in more than half of the\nsample. Though this has previously been detected in individual\nULXs (Stobbart et al. 2004; Foschini et al. 2004), or as minority\npopulations in ULX samples (Feng & Kaaret 2005), this is the first\nsuggestion that the majority of ULXs, across the whole range of\nULX luminosity, might appear thus. Indeed, we demonstrate that\nthe most successful empirical modelling of our sample is achieved\nusing a model in which the high-energy portion of the spectrum is\ndescribed by the MCD model, with a soft excess modelled as a cool\nblackbody emitter.\nThis obviously adds to the challenges in modelling ULXs as\nIMBHs. Indeed, though 8\/13 ULXs present acceptable fits to the\nsimple IMBH model of a cool disc plus a hard power-law contin-\nuum, we are again faced with the problem noted by Roberts et al.\n(2005). Namely we detect a very dominant power-law (> 80 per\ncent of the observed 0.3\u201310 keV flux) that appears too hard for what\nshould be a HS (or perhaps VH) source, if we are to believe that\nthe inner-disc temperature can provide an estimate of the BH mass\n(1.6 < \u0393 < 2.5 for the IMBH candidates in our sample, compared\nto approximately 2.1 < \u0393 < 4.8 for the HS, and \u0393 > 2.5 for the\nVH state - McClintock & Remillard 2003). Curvature above 2 keV\ncompounds these problems further, as the IMBH model assumes\nthat whilst the bigger black hole results in a cooler accretion disc,\nthe corona remains similar to that observed in Galactic BHBs, i.e.\noptically-thin and hence modelled with a power-law. In fact, there\nis no reason to suppose that increasing the mass of the BH should\nalter the state of the corona - timing measurements at least appear\nto scale linearly with BH mass for given spectral states, implying\nthe properties of the states themselves are invariant with mass (cf.\nDone & Gierlin\u00b4ski 2005). But the detection of curvature implies\nthat either the state of the coronae is changing as the BH becomes\nmore massive, or a different physical process is responsible for the\nemission above 2 keV.\nThe dual thermal model uses a MCD to model this curvature,\nwith inner disc temperatures in the range 1.1\u20132.2 keV. As Fig 3\nshows, this provides a natural explanation of ULXs as a simple ex-\ntension of the behaviour of Galactic BHBs, with more luminous\nand slightly hotter discs. In this case, assuming one can exceed\nthe Eddington limit, there is no obvious requirement for IMBHs.\nHowever, even this simple empirical model has limitations; for\ninstance, in order to see both the inner regions of the accretion\ndisc and an optically-thick outflow simultaneously, one requires\na very specific geometry and viewing angle. One may therefore\nhave to consider further explanations for the origin of the soft ex-\ncess component; we note that one interesting suggestion, that has\nrecently been found to work in some AGN X-ray spectra, is that\nthe soft excess could arise in relativistically-blurred atomic fea-\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\nXMM-Newton observations of the brightest ULXs 15\ntures found in the reflection spectrum of a photoionised accretion\ndisc (Crummy et al. 2006). A further concern for this model is that\nsimilar spectral shapes have not been commonly found in Galactic\nBHBs, with the exception of slight soft excesses (modelled by the\nextension of the power-law component below the MCD) seen in the\nspectra in LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 (Haardt et al. 2001). One expla-\nnation could be that soft excesses, below the MCD component in\nGalactic BHB spectra, are not seen due to a combination of high\nabsorption columns and lack of detector sensitivity at low X-ray\nenergies. However, the columns to a significant minority of BHBs\nare not much in excess of the \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 columns inferred for\nour ULXs (McClintock & Remillard 2003), and many have now\nbeen observed by XMM-Newton and Chandra without such soft\nexcesses being reported. Perhaps this is simply telling us that this\nspectral shape is unique to the very high accretion rates required if\nULXs contain stellar-mass BHs.\nThe model that did best in terms of providing acceptable fits\nto the data was also the only physically self-consistent model we\nused in the analysis, namely the DISKPN+EQPAIR spectral model.\nThe best fits provided by this model show, without exception, that\nthe accretion disc photons seeding the corona are cool. In fact they\nare cool enough, at < 0.3 keV, to be consistent with the accretion\ndisc around an IMBH. However, this model also provides a phys-\nical explanation for the curvature above 2 keV: unlike in conven-\ntional BHBs, it originates in an optically-thick corona. This com-\nbination of a cool disc and optically-thick corona has already been\nobserved in Ho II X-1; Goad et al. (2006) note the cosmetic simi-\nlarities between this spectral model and the model of Zhang et al.\n(2000) of a three-layered atmospheric structure in the accretion\ndiscs around BHBs. More specifically, their model includes a warm\nlayer (kT\u223c1\u20131.5 keV, \u03c4\u223c10) between the cool optically-thick ac-\ncretion disc (kT\u223c0.2\u20130.5 keV) and the hot optically-thin corona\n(kT\u223c100 keV, \u03c4\u223c1) of BHBs, which is responsible for the dom-\ninant component below \u223c10 keV (see also Nayakshin & Melia\n1997, Misra et al. 1998). The warm layer appears relatively stable\nand hence unconnected to the hot corona, which can be highly dy-\nnamic and even disappear completely (Misra et al. 1998). In this\npicture, the cool disc seeds the warm optically thick scattering\nmedium, and as such may explain both components seen in our\nmodelling.\nThis model has been successful in describing the X-ray spec-\ntrum of GRS 1915+105 (Zhang et al. 2000), and so Goad et al.\n(2006) speculate that this modelling, combined with an upper limit\non the mass of the BH in Ho II X-1 of \u223c 100-M\u2299 derived from\ntiming properties, implies that Ho II X-1 behaves in an analogous\nmanner to GRS 1915+105 in its \u03c7-class. We speculate, by exten-\nsion, that many of the ULXs in our sample that are well fitted by\nthis spectral model could also be GRS 1915+105 analogues, i.e.\nstellar-mass BHs accreting at around and in excess of the Edding-\nton limit. We note that if individual BHs with mass up to 80-M\u2299\ncan form from stellar processes as suggested by Belczynski et al.\n(2004), and these larger stellar-mass BHs exist in ULXs, then the\nfactors by which the Eddington limit are exceeded need not be large\nfor even the brighter ULXs (factors \u223c 2 \u2212 3 only). One piece of\nadditional, encouraging evidence in this respect is that, similarly\nto Ho II X-1 and GRS 1915+105 in its analogous \u03c7-class of be-\nhaviour, the light curves of the ULXs in this sample show little or\nno intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to hours, with the\nfractional variability (in excess of counting noise) limited to \u223c< 10\nper cent in all cases9.\nRecently a second, very plausible explanation for our\nphysically self-consistent spectral modelling has come to light.\nDone & Kubota (2005) describe spectral modelling of the Galac-\ntic BHB XTE J1550-564 in its high-luminosity VH state, using a\nmodel in which the energetics of the inner regions of the accretion\ndisc are coupled to a surrounding corona. This results in a cooler\napparent disc temperature, as the corona drains energy from the\ninner disc, and an optically-thick corona, that are both part of the\naccretion flow. Done & Kubota (2005) note that this may provide\nan explanation for the low disc temperatures observed in ULXs not\nreliant upon the presence of an IMBH. As we also provide evidence\nthat the corona itself is indeed optically-thick in such sources, this\nmodel must constitute a very serious physical alternative to IMBHs\nfor the majority of ULXs. However, even here there are caveats,\nfor instance Feng & Kaaret (2005) note that optically-thick coro-\nnae should show deep Fe K absorption edges, unless the accreting\nmaterial has a very low metallicity. We do not detect such features\nin our analysis.\nOur empirical spectral fitting has posed new challenges for\nthe IMBH model fits to ULX spectra, and our physical mod-\nelling describes scenarios in which the bulk of ULXs could\nbe stellar-mass BHs accreting at around the Eddington limit.\nThis is perhaps not surprising, as many strands of recent ev-\nidence have pointed away from an IMBH model for most\nULXs. In fact, excepting the somewhat unique case for M82\nX-1 as an IMBH, possibly formed in the dense MGG-11 clus-\nter or captured as the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy\n(e.g. Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003; Portegies Zwart et al. 2004;\nKing & Dehnen 2005; Mucciarelli et al. 2006), and the cool disc\ndetections (shown to be somewhat ambiguous in this paper), ob-\nservational results have tended to argue in the opposite sense. For\nexample, the probable breaking of the Eddington limit seen in\nsome - perhaps most (see Jonker & Nelemans 2004) - Galactic\nBHBs, and especially GRS 1915+105, argues that we cannot ex-\nclude stellar-mass BHs from producing ULXs on this trivial basis\n(McClintock & Remillard 2003). Also, the shape of the universal\nX-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) for high-mass X-ray binaries,\nderived by Grimm et al. (2003), is somewhat puzzling if IMBHs\nconstitute a significant part of the ULX population. In particular,\nwhy does the XLF appear to cut-off at \u223c 2 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121?10\nSurely no such cut-off would be present if \u223c 1000-M\u2299 IMBHs\nconstitute a large fraction of the ULX population (we are certainly\nunaware of any other source population that cuts off at \u223c 0.1 Ed-\ndington rate). We therefore conclude that, on current evidence, it is\nunlikely that accreting IMBHs constitute a large proportion of the\ntotal ULX population.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have conducted a detailed examination of the X-ray spectral\nshapes in a sample of the highest quality XMM-Newton EPIC ULX\n9 Excepting the NGC 55 ULX, which shows prominent dips in its XMM-\nNewton light curve (Stobbart et al. 2004).\n10 A near identical cut-off is found from a large sample of ULXs studied\nby Swartz et al. (2004). Independent support for this cut-off comes from\nthe empirical LX\u2212 star formation rate relationship of Grimm et al. (2003),\nwhich can only have its linear form above \u223c 10M\u2299 yr\u22121 if the cut-off is\nreal (see also Gilfanov et al. 2004).\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201316\n16 A-M. Stobbart et al.\ndatasets available to us. Most notably, more than half of the ULXs\nshow at least marginal evidence for curvature in their 2\u201310 keV\nspectra, which is somewhat unexpected if they are to be interpreted\nas the accreting \u223c 1000-M\u2299 IMBHs suggested by modelling the\nsoft spectral components as accretion discs. Physical modelling\nshows that this curvature is likely to originate in optically-thick\ncoronae, which in turn leads to interpretations of the ULXs in terms\nof high accretion-rate stellar-mass (or slightly larger) BHs operat-\ning at around the Eddington limit. However, while we conclude that\nit is likely that the general ULX population does not have a large\ncontribution from IMBHs, we obviously cannot rule out the possi-\nbility that some ULXs do possess IMBHs. Perhaps the best candi-\ndate on the basis of our spectral fitting is M81 X-9, which is well fit-\nted by cool disc plus power-law\/optically-thin corona models, and\ndoes not show explicit curvature in its 2\u201310 keV spectrum, though\neven this ULX may be fitted using a hot (\u223c 2.2 keV) accretion disc\nplus soft excess model. Clearly, it is difficult to find unique solu-\ntions for these sources even with high quality XMM-Newton EPIC\ndata. Ultimately, we may perhaps have to wait for radial velocity\nmeasurements from the optical counterpart of an ULX, leading to\ndynamical mass measurements of the compact accretor, before we\nhave conclusive evidence whether any individual ULX does har-\nbour an IMBH.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank an anonymous referee for their help in improving this pa-\nper.
