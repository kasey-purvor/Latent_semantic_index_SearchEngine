Introduction\n[2] Floodplains represent zones of important geomorpho-\nlogical, ecological, and hydrological processes that control\nthe linkage between hillslope and channel domains in\nlowland environments. In this context, floodplain hydrology\nis of great significance to pathways and dynamics of\npollutant transport [e.g., Hill, 1990, 1997; Haycock et\nal., 1997], ecosystem functioning [Meyer and Edwards,\n1990; Smock et al., 1992], habitat diversity and connectivity\n[e.g., Forman and Gordon, 1986; Junk, 1997, 1999;\nHuggenberger et al., 1998], and the downstream propaga-\ntion of flood waves [e.g., Kondolf et al., 1987; Hunt, 1990;\nStewart et al., 1999]. In humid temperate environments, the\nfloodplain aquifer receives water from local precipitation,\nhillslope runoff, and the channel (during floods) and then\nstores, redistributes and eventually releases the water to the\nriver under base flow conditions [Mertes, 1997; Woessner,\n2000]. Besides these variable inputs and antecedent mois-\nture conditions, water table fluctuations within the flood-\nplain have been found to be highly dependent on the\nmorphology [e.g., Mertes, 1997], material properties [e.g.,\nGillham, 1984] and internal structure of the floodplain\nsediments, the latter frequently providing paths of prefer-\nential flow [e.g., Poole et al., 2002; Burt et al., 2002b].\nDespite considerable research on the effect of bank storage\non flood hydrographs [e.g., Kondolf et al., 1987; Hunt,\n1990], groundwater recharge of alluvial aquifers [Winter,\n1995], and more recently on channel-aquifer interactions in\nthe hyporheic zone [e.g., Stanford and Ward, 1988; Dahm\nand Valett, 1996], very little has been published about the\ncomplex hydrological interactions between subsurface hill-\nslope runoff, floodplain groundwater, and river floodwater\non a high-resolution event basis. One reason for this is a\nlack of high-resolution data (both spatial and temporal), but\nsuch data are essential to an understanding of floodplain\n1Now at Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/04\/2003WR002619$09.00\nW12409\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 40, W12409, doi:10.1029\/2003WR002619, 2004\n1 of 13\nhydrology and thereby several other aspects of floodplain\nfunction. For example, denitrification and other nitrogen\ncycling processes will be strongly dependent on hydrolog-\nical fluctuations within the floodplain [Burt et al., 2002a]\nas denitrification reactions optimally require anaerobic\nsaturated conditions. Saturation levels and water fluxes also\nimpact flow paths, residence times and the mobilization of\npotential contaminants within the floodplain; there is a clear\ncorrelation between saturation levels, hydraulic conductivity\nand pollutant transport rates [Claxton et al., 2003]. During\nfloods, higher water tables on the floodplain may also lead\nto greater connectivity between hillslopes and channels and\nact as a control on the movement of nutrients and genetic\nmaterial between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Hence\na better understanding of the dynamics of floodplain hy-\ndrology is a key step toward the better management of\nlowland floodplain environments.\n[3] A field experiment to investigate water table fluctua-\ntions was set up on the floodplain of the River Severn,\nShropshire, United Kingdom; substantial hydrological inter-\nactions between the river, the floodplain and the adjacent\nhillslopes have been documented at this site [Stewart et al.,\n1999]. The classic model for such interactions is the so-\ncalled \u2018\u2018bank storage\u2019\u2019 effect [Pinder and Sauer, 1971,\nFigure 1]. Under base flow conditions, groundwater dis-\ncharges from the floodplain into the river, but during a\nflood, when the water level in the channel rises above the\nwater table in the floodplain, this reverses the hydraulic\ngradient and induces flow from the channel into the flood-\nplain. After the flood, the river level falls and a streamward\nhydraulic gradient is again established. At first, floodplain\nwater flows in both directions, but eventually all floodplain\nflow is toward the river. Hence the bank storage model\nenvisages floodplain flow processes as being predominantly\ntwo-dimensional, perpendicular to the river.\n[4] Starting from this conceptual basis, Bates et al. [2000]\ncombined field data with two-dimensional vertically aligned\nnumerical modeling to study river-floodplain-hillslope inter-\nactions along a cross-floodplain transect for two over-bank\nevents at the River Severn field site. The results showed that\nan extensive hyporheic zone and a groundwater ridge\nformed within the floodplain during over-bank flooding,\nwith a strong water table gradient directed toward the\nhillslope-floodplain boundary. River stage and floodplain\nwater levels rose and fell by up to 5 m during each event,\nimplying that a lateral flux of water across the floodplain,\nperpendicular to the channel, was likely to be the dominant\nflow process occurring during a flood event, in accordance\nwith the classic bank storage model. By contrast, up- and\ndown-valley water table gradients were comparatively low\nduring a flood event, indicating that a three-dimensional\nflow pattern (with significant water table gradients in both\nthe cross-floodplain and down-valley directions) was un-\nlikely to exist during a flood and that a two-dimensional\nmodeling approach was justified.\n[5] Bates et al. [2000] found that a groundwater ridge\ndeveloped within the floodplain because, while the water\ntable in the near-channel zone rose near-synchronously with\nthe rising river stage, the water table at the base of the\nhillslope did not respond until much later in the event, when\nsubsurface storm flow on the adjacent hillslope, in response\nto local rainfall, reached the hillslope-floodplain boundary.\nIn effect, the water table level beneath the inundated\nfloodplain rapidly rose to the surface, but in the noninun-\ndated zone at the base of the hillslope, the water level did\nnot rise until much later. As a result, for most of the flood,\nwater table gradient was effectively zero across most of the\nfloodplain but there was a high hydraulic gradient near the\nback of the floodplain toward the base of the hillslope.\nModel results indicated high flow velocities directed toward\nthe hillslope as the inundation front approached the hill-\nslope\/floodplain junction. The arrival of the groundwater\nridge at the floodplain edge acted as a barrier for hillslope\ndrainage, temporarily \u2018\u2018switching off\u2019\u2019 subsurface hillslope\ninputs to the floodplain, a condition that, depending on the\nevent dynamics, can prevail for up to 10 days according to\nthe results of Claxton et al. [2003]. The two-dimensional\nmodel was found to perform well around the flood peak but\nwas much less successful during the rising and recession\nlimbs. The authors nevertheless concluded that floodplain\ngroundwater flows were dominated by cross-floodplain\nfluxes approximately perpendicular to the river during a\nflood event. However, they noted that, at the beginning and\nend of a flood event, the down-valley hydraulic gradient\ncould become comparable to the lateral, cross-floodplain\ngradient and that a more three-dimensional flow field could\npotentially become established with both lateral and down-\nvalley fluxes becoming significant within the alluvial sedi-\nments. Here, we here adopt the same terminology as Bates\net al. [2000] and the classic bank storage model, with the\ncross-floodplain and vertical directions being referred to as\ndimensions 1 and 2, and the down-valley direction being\ndimension 3. A two-dimensional flow is therefore consid-\nered to be one where the flux direction is across the\nfloodplain, perpendicular to the channel.\n[6] On the basis of the model results of Bates et al.\n[2000], Burt et al. [2002b] reconsidered the piezometer data\nof both flood events modeled by Bates et al. [2000] and,\nadditionally, included three smaller in-bank events in their\ninterpretation of water table fluctuations. It was found that a\nsimilar groundwater ridge also forms during in-bank events.\nBurt et al. [2002b] also showed the existence of flow paths\nthat were predominantly parallel to the river during the\nrecession period. The development of such a three-dimen-\nsional flow pattern (with significant cross-floodplain and\ndown-valley fluxes) was attributed to local topographic\nfeatures of the floodplain and the hillslope, determining\ndifferent up-slope contributing areas of subsurface hillslope\ndischarge. The water tables influenced by a hillslope hollow\nrevealed enhanced groundwater levels and therefore the\nformation of a [Burt et al., 2002b, p. 18] \u2018\u2018dome of\ngroundwater. . .with flow fanning out, not only across the\nfloodplain toward the river, but also sideways, down-valley,\nand, indeed, up-valley.\u2019\u2019 The existence of both lateral and\ndown-valley flows of floodplain groundwater, generated by\nlocally stronger hillslope runoff during the recession period,\nenabled Burt et al. [2002b, p. 18] to conclude that \u2018\u2018a full\nthree-dimensional approach becomes essential\u2019\u2019 in contrast\nto the classic bank storage model.\n2. Aims and Objectives\n[7] The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis\nand description of floodplain water table response during\n2 of 13\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE W12409\nflood events. The results are used to derive a conceptual\nthree-dimensional model of floodplain hydrology, which\nemphasises linkages with both adjacent hillslopes and the\nriver channel. This is achieved by identifying characteristic,\nrecurrent spatial and temporal patterns of water table\nresponse within the floodplain and their controlling factors.\nFirst, we locate and characterize spatial response units\nwithin the floodplain, making it possible to reduce the\ndimensionality of the data to a few sensors, each of which\nis representative of the identified units and which together\ncharacterize the system behavior. Next, we examine whether\ndeviating patterns of water table response during different\nflood events can be identified, based on the behavior of\nrepresentative sensors. We then identify characteristic\npatterns of water table response and seek to explain them\nin relation to the main controlling factors: river stage,\nhillslope discharge and antecedent conditions. Finally, the\nresults are used to propose a conceptual model of floodplain\nwater table response.\n3. Study Area and Sampling Strategy\n[8] The field site is situated on a straight channel section\non the left bank of the River Severn near the village of\nLeighton, Shropshire, United Kingdom. The total floodplain\nhere is \u00011 km wide with a \u000145 m wide main channel. The\nfield site is located approximately midway along the Severn\nat \u000140 m above sea level; the basin area is \u00013717 km2 and\ndrains eastward from the Welsh uplands which rise to\n\u0001600 m above sea level. Bankfull discharge at Leighton\nis \u0001180 m3 s\u00021 with the largest floods peaks exceeding\n450 m3 s\u00021. Here, the left-bank floodplain is only \u0001120 m\nwide and is bounded by a \u000170 m high, \u000125\u0001 slope\nconsisting of the remnants of one or more alluvial terraces\nand colluvial hillslope material. The slope comprises two\ndistinct geomorphological features: a hollow (upslope con-\ntributing area \u00012 ha) with plan concavity and convergent\nflow, and an adjacent neighboring spur (upslope contribut-\ning area \u0001150 m2) with a convex profile and divergent flow.\nThe spur feature is \u00015 m wide and extends back to the top\nof the terrace rampart approximately 30m back from the\nedge of the floodplain. The hollow drains a much larger\nwedge-shaped area extending back to the local watershed.\nThe major geomorphological features on the floodplain are\nthe extension of the hillslope hollow on to the floodplain\ntoward the southeast as a shallow depression, and a lower\narea near and subparallel to the channel. A coring survey\nrevealed a relatively simple subsurface stratigraphy across\nthe floodplain. A gravel layer of unknown thickness is\nevident at depths ranging from 2.4 to 5.5 m, overlain by\nsandy-clay material. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of\nboth stratigraphic units was found by falling head well tests\nto be of the same order of magnitude, 2.54 \u0003 10\u00026 m s\u00021\nand 1.56 \u0003 10\u00026 m s\u00021 respectively (Figure 1).\n[9] Two 120 m transects were installed to monitor soil\nwater pressure across the full width of the left bank\nfloodplain at Leighton (see Figure 2). The piezometers\nfurthest from the river in each transect were placed several\nmeters upslope of the break in slope at the edge of the\nfloodplain in order to capture the net hillslope flux to the\nFigure 1. Scheme of the bank storage process. The upper panel presents the water balance of the\nfloodplain; the lower panel shows an idealized cross section of the river with the adjoining aquifer. At\ntime \u2018\u2018a\u2019\u2019 the river is receiving base flow; at time \u2018\u2018b\u2019\u2019 a flood peak is passing and flow is induced into the\nbanks; at time \u2018\u2018c\u2019\u2019 the peak has passed and the bank storage wedge is draining [modified from Dingman,\n1994].\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE\n3 of 13\nW12409\nfloodplain at this point. One transect runs from the end point\nof the hillslope spur to the channel, while the other begins at\nthe point where the hillslope hollow discharges into the\nfloodplain and continues along the depression before run-\nning across the floodplain to the channel. Piezometers are\nlabeled numerically from the hillslope to the channel. Thus\ntransect S (Spur) has four sensors (S1\u2013S4) installed from\nthe base of the hillslope (S1) and across the floodplain, with\nS4 being set \u00013 m back from the channel bank. Transect H\n(Hillslope) has three sensors (H1, H2 and H3) within the\nfloodplain extension of the hollow and a further sensor (H4)\nclose to the river bank. There was also continuous mea-\nsurement of river stage and precipitation. All sensors were\nconnected to data loggers. Measurements were taken every\n15 min and stored as hourly averages. Potential errors of the\npiezometric data are of the order of \u00b110 cm.\n4. Methods\n[10] We analyze data from four over-bank flood events\n(event A, D, E and G) that occurred in winter 1998\u20131999\n(Figure 3). Unless otherwise stated, all available piezometer\ndata from these events are used for the analysis of water\ntable response. To study whether memory effects of previ-\nous events impact upon water table response, three in-bank\nevents (event B, C and F) were included, which together\nwith over-bank events D and E, form an event sequence (B,\nC, D, E and F).\n[11] Piezometer interrelationships were explored by cor-\nrelation analysis using SPSS 8.0. The results of the corre-\nlation analysis were used to classify the piezometers into\ngroups of sensors with similar behavior, making it possible\nto reduce the complexity of various piezometer time series\nto a few representative sensors. Scatterplots of representa-\ntive sensors were then produced for visual interpretation;\nthese contain the necessary information required to describe\nthe system behavior and were used to identify recurring\nwater table patterns during flood events. Scatterplots were\nalso used to generate hysteresis curves showing the covari-\nation between piezometers and river stage.\n[12] To visualize recurring water table patterns, we pro-\nduced water table maps for two selected events; these\nprovide a representative picture of water table changes\nduring flood events at the study site for the time period\naddressed. Water table mapping was performed with the\nSURFER 7.0 visualization package using kriging with a\nsimple linear variogram. For simplicity, the interpolated\nwater table was calculated for a rectangular bounding box.\nSome uncertainty is associated with a lack of information\nbetween the piezometer transects, which might be of sig-\nnificance since there are marked changes in the surface\ntopography of the floodplain. Therefore the maps cannot be\nregarded as an exact representation of the water table, but\nthe general pattern is likely to be reliable, given the\nrelatively smooth and low-gradient spatial patterns of water\ntable response. Twelve maps were produced for both, the\nfirst and last over-bank events of the season (event A and G,\nFigure 3). All maps are based on full resolution with 11 data\npoints, four along each transect plus three along the river,\nexcept those labeled with an asterisk, where no data for\nFigure 2.

Since a few piezometers\nsometimes failed to operate in the early rising limb or late\nrecession period as the water table was below the datum\nlevel of the piezometer, we chose to avoid these stages.\nThus some bias is introduced in the choice of the point in\ntime for which maps were produced.\n5. Results\n5.1. Piezometer Intercorrelations\n[13] A matrix of squared correlation coefficient (R2)\nvalues for all piezometer pairs including river stage is\nprovided in Table 1. Two distinct groups of piezometers\nappear. First, the piezometers S1, H1 and H2 near the\nfloodplain-hillslope border are interrelated but show no\nsignificant correlation with the other floodplain piezometers\nor river stage. Second, all remaining piezometers (S4, S3,\nS2, and H4) exhibit strong intercorrelations and are all\nstrongly correlated with river stage. This group can further\nbe divided into two groups of piezometers with very strong\nintercorrelations (R2 values above 0.9). The first group\nincludes the river bank piezometers S4 and H4 and river\nstage, while the second group is located along the spur\ntransect (S3\u2013S2 and S4\u2013S2. In addition, H3 must be\nTable 1.

Repetition of Water Table Behavior\n[14] Given the high correlations between specific groups\nof piezometers, S1, S4 and H3 are sufficient to visualize the\nbehavior of the water table for the different events in three-\ndimensions (Figure 4). The sensors chosen represent the\nhillslope piezometers that respond independently of river\nstage, those piezometers strongly correlated with river stage,\nand the floodplain hollow with its own response pattern.\nWhile the behavior of the water table is similar for events\nD, E and G, the rising limb of event A in autumn 1998\ndeviates significantly from the general pattern. Therefore we\nchose events A and G to map changing patterns of water\ntable response with event G being also representative of\nevents D and E.\n5.3. Water Table Maps\n[15] The preevent conditions of event A in autumn 1998\nare characterized by a comparatively low and horizontal\npiezometric surface at ca. 520 cm above datum without\nsignificant gradients within the water table or toward the\nriver (Figure 5a). When the river starts to rise, the water table\nrises accordingly as an essentially planar horizontal surface\nby 70 cm within 2 days (Figure 5b) until inundation occurs\nin the near-river area and along the floodplain hollow,\ncausing the water table there to rise by more than a meter\nwithin 1 day (Figure 5c). Now, a groundwater ridge or dome\n(i.e., with a clearly three-dimensional form) develops with\ndownward gradients of \u00014% directed to the spur transect\nand the hillslope-floodplain boundary. By day 4, the inun-\ndation front reaches piezometer S3, which rises rapidly by\n2 meters within 4 hours due to the large infiltration flux and a\nsteep water table gradient (\u00018%) toward the hillslope-\nfloodplain border develops (Figure 5e). At this point, the\nlateral water table gradient is much greater than the up- or\ndown-valley gradients, and the flow pattern can essentially\nbe described as two-dimensional across the floodplain. This\npattern persists for \u00015 days, associated with rising water\ntables from 550 cm to 740 cm at the foot of the hillslope\nand hence decreasing lateral hydraulic gradients, until the\nrecession commences (Figure 5f) after \u00019 days from the\nbeginning of the event. During the early recession\n(Figures 5g\u20135i), the water table falls in line with river stage\nby \u000135 cm\/day and therefore exhibits a planar shape again,\nalthough a significant depression in the piezometric surface\nnear piezometer H2 is indicated on the maps (Figures 5g\nand 5h). Whether this represents a problem with the sensor\nor is real remains uncertain, but a measurement error seems\nlikely on this occasion. This effect will therefore not be\ndiscussed in great depth later on. During the later recession\n(Figures 5j\u20135l), when standing water is no longer present on\nthe floodplain, the water table pattern undergoes a transition\nfrom the classic two-dimensional bank storage model con-\ndition with flow gradients of \u00012% directed toward the\nchannel (Figure 5j), to a three-dimensional pattern caused\nby high water tables (\u0001650 cm) at the floodplain hollow\n(H3) and the hillslope piezometers, with gradients of \u00012 to\n3% from the floodplain hollow toward the spur transect and\nthe river (Figures 5k and 5l). The three-dimensional pattern\nis established after\u00013 weeks from the start of the rising limb\nand \u000110 days after the flood peak. It persists for the entire\nwinter season, except during high-discharge events, and may\nbe regarded as the \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 winter condition at this site.\n[16] The sequence of water table patterns over the course\nof event G in February and March 1999 event is only\nslightly different. The preevent water table shows base flow\nconditions with the familiar groundwater dome within the\nfloodplain hollow at H3 (Figure 6a). The rising river causes\nthe spur piezometers S3 and S2 to rise synchronously by\n\u000170 cm within 2 days, compensating the three-dimensional\nnature of the gradient field and eventually forming a planar\nhorizontal surface (Figures 6b\u20136d), similar to the pattern of\nevent A at this stage (Figure 5b). In the following period\n(Figures 6e\u20136g), the water table across the floodplain\ncontinues to rise nearly synchronously with the river by\n\u000180 cm\/day. Hence there is no significant asymmetric water\ntable between hollow and spur transect as during event A in\nautumn 1998 (Figure 5c and 5d). In general, the gradients\ntoward the hillslope associated with the groundwater ridge\nare \u00013% in comparison to 8% during event A (Figure 5e),\nalthough the depression at H2 develops repeatedly\n(Figures 6f and 6g). The patterns of water table fluctua-\ntions during the recession period (Figures 6h\u20136l) are\nessentially identical to event A (Figures 5h\u20135l).\n[17] So far, we have identified spatial units of water table\nresponse within the floodplain, which respond similarly\nduring flood events. We have also shown that the water\ntable fluctuations during flood events at this site follow a\nrecurring pattern, except for the rising limb of event A,\nwhich deviates from the pattern of the remaining events.\nThe next sections explore the dynamics of the water table\nmore closely by examining the response of piezometers to\nriver stage and hillslope runoff.\n5.4. Response of Piezometers to River Stage\n[18] Here we use S4, S2, H3 and S1 as representative\nsensors of the river banks, spur, hollow and hillslope group\nrespectively to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The\nchosen sensors are those which operated continuously\nFigure 4. System state of the floodplain groundwater\ntable, defined by the constellation of the water table at the\npiezometers S4, S1, and H3, representing the river banks\nand spur, hillslope, and floodplain hollow group, respec-\ntively. Data from all four over-bank (A, D, E, G) events are\nshown in chronological order from light gray to black.\n6 of 13\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE W12409\nwithin each group (see Table 1; number of available data\npoints for correlations). Figure 7 presents river stage \u2013\nwater table hysteresis plots for the piezometers S1, S2, H3,\nand S4, which represent the hillslope group (S1, H1, H2),\nthe spur transect group (S2, S3), the floodplain hollow (H3)\nand the river bank group (H4, S4), respectively.\n[19] The riverbank piezometers show a synchronous and\nessentially identical behavior to river stage since all data\npoints are aligned along the x = y line. The hysteresis plots\nfor the four events are remarkably similar suggesting very\nlittle difference in the water table response between events.\nFor all recession periods, the response of the river bank\npiezometers (H4, S4) can also be regarded as identical to\nriver stage since the data points overlay each other. The\nnarrow shape of the hysteresis curves also implies only\nminor differences in the water table response between the\nrising and recession limbs. Thus the water table is a\nmaximum of 50 cm higher during the recessions in com-\nparison to the rising limbs for the same river stage, and\nfrequently much less. The shape of the hysteresis curves, in\nterms of how open or closed they are, therefore approx-\nimates to how much water is stored temporarily within the\nfloodplain over the course of a flood event (i.e., the bank\nstorage effect).\n[20] The water table of the inner floodplain of the spur\ntransect (piezometers S2 and S3) responds in a somewhat\nsimilar fashion to river stage as do the river bank piezom-\neters. The river water level determines the general envelope\nof the behavior of these piezometers since the hysteresis\ncurve follows and includes the x = y line. Since the rising\nlimbs plot parallel to the x = y line, this confirms that the\nwater table responds synchronously to river stage changes\nFigure 5.

See text for further explanation.\n8 of 13\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE W12409\nand at approximately the same rate (\u0001120\u2013170 cm\/day\ndepending on the event), apart from an initial delay during\nthe early rising period of the first autumn flood, event A.\nAgain, the water table response during the recessions is\nmore similar than during the rising limbs, since the data\npoints of the recession periods plot more closely together.\nThe hysteresis curves are relatively open, which means that\nthe water table elevations for a given river stage are more\ndifferent for these piezometers (S2 and S3) between the\nrising and recession limbs than for those in the in the near-\nchannel area. At a given river stage, the water table may be\nup to 2 m higher during the recession than during the rising\nlimb as is evident for event A, though these differences are\nsmaller (\u00011 m and less) during the other events. This shows\nthat water is stored for longer within the inner floodplain\nzone of the spur transect during flood events in contrast to\nthe relatively limited storage within the river banks.\n[21] The counterpart of S2 and S3, the hollow piezometer\nH3, shows a different behavior again. Except for the rising\nlimb of event A, the response of H3 to river stage change is\nvery similar for all rising and recession periods, as shown\nby the closed hysteresis loops. There is, hence, little\nretention capacity for flood water within the floodplain\nhollow. Prior to and after inundation at H3, the water level\nplots above river stage virtually all of the time, but still\nexhibits a trend following the river hydrograph, although\nwith a lower rate of change (\u000160\u201390 cm\/day depending on\nthe event) than the river stage.\n[22] The pattern of water table dynamics close to the\nhillslope-floodplain boundary (piezometers S1, H1, H2) is\ncompletely different to all other piezometers across the\nfloodplain. Here, water tables show larger interevent differ-\nences and appear not to be related to river stage changes,\nexhibiting relatively small but rather complex fluctuations.\nSome regularity emerges since the water table dynamics\nalso occupy a distinct area within the phase space (except\nfor event A), and a roughly similar behavior of rising water\ntables around the flood peak shows up. However, the water\ntables rise by only 15\u201330 cm\/day; this is much lower than\nthe rate of rise of the river.\n[23] While river stage is the primary driver of water table\nfluctuations for the river bank and spur transect groups of\npiezometers, whose water tables react instantly to river stage\nchanges, a further factor is required to explain the water\ntable fluctuations within the floodplain hollow and at the\nfoot of the hillslope.\n5.5. Hillslope-Floodplain Water Table Relationships\n[24] We test the hypothesis that water table fluctuations at\nthe hillslope-floodplain boundary are caused by the ground-\nwater ridge, which drives water into this area. We then\nassess the relationship between the hillslope piezometers\nand the floodplain hollow piezometer H3 to clarify the role\nof hillslope runoff in influencing water table fluctuations\nwithin the floodplain hollow.\n[25] River stage, the hillslope piezometer S1 and the\ngradient between S2 and S1, which approximates the\ninclination of the groundwater ridge toward the hillslope,\nare shown in Figure 8 for events A and G. Through event A,\npiezometer S1 indicates an increasing water table, indepen-\ndent from the inclination of the groundwater ridge, which\npeaks during the recession period while the gradient be-\ntween S2 and S1 decreases, i.e., the groundwater ridge\nflattens. In contrast, during event G, S1 seems to rise\nsynchronously to the change in gradient between S2 and\nS1, but the rising phase of S1 precedes the formation of a\ngroundwater ridge, i.e., the water table at the floodplain-\nhillslope boundary starts to rise before a hydraulic gradient\ntoward the hillslope becomes established, which could drive\nwater into this area from the floodplain.\n[26] The influence of hillslope runoff on water table\nfluctuations within the floodplain hollow at H3 is apparent\nin Figure 9. Except for the rising period of event A, the data\npoints plot parallel to the S1 = H3 line, indicating that they\nare strongly correlated on an event basis. In contrast, H3\u2019s\ncounterpart from the spur transect, S3, shows no consistent\nFigure 8. Change of the gradient from S2 to S1 (inclination of the groundwater ridge toward the\nhillslope) (dashed line) and the elevation of the water table at the back of the floodplain (S1) (thin black\nline) for events A and G over time. The river hydrograph is given in thick black. The dotted horizontal line\n(\u2018\u2018no gradient\u2019\u2019) indicates the switch from a groundwater ridge situation (positive gradients) to base flow\nconditions (negative gradients). The gradient, approximating the relative magnitude of Darcian flow from\nthe ridge to the hillslope, cannot explain the behavior of the water table at the hillslope-floodplain border.\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE\n9 of 13\nW12409\nrelationship with S1, although short periods are evident that\nshow linkages between them since the data plot parallel to\nthe S1 = S3 line.\n[27] Besides consistent dependencies between piezome-\nters, and between piezometers and river stage, some rela-\ntionships seem to emerge only on an event or subevent\nscale. The next section investigates whether water table\nfluctuations within the floodplain are subject to memory\neffects of previous events, by analyzing the response of the\npiezometers to river stage changes over the course of an\nevent sequence (Events, B, C, D, E and F).\n5.6. Water Table Fluctuations Over the Event\nSequence\n[28] Two main phenomena are apparent from Figure 10.\nFirst, except for the hillslope piezometers (S1, H1 and H2),\nthe response of the floodplain water table shows few\ndifferences over the event sequence for all piezometers.\nWhile all other piezometers indicate a quick return to\npreevent levels, the hillslope piezometers clearly appear to\nbe influenced by previous events and exhibit hysteresis\nbehavior. Their water tables rise around the flood peak\nbut thereafter maintain their level so that the water table\nprogressively rises during the event sequence. Second, the\nrelationship of the floodplain water table at the river\nbanks and along the spur transect to river stage seems to\nstrengthen over the event sequence, especially after the first\nover-bank event (event D). Although this effect is of\nsecondary importance, it is suggested by the successive\ncloser alignment of the data points along the x = y line.\n6. Discussion\n[29] We propose a conceptual model that involves two\ninterdependent mechanisms. First, kinematic waves induced\nby rapidly changing river stage cause floodplain water\ntables to respond quickly; and, second, the floodplain water\ntable interferes with hillslope contributions that have to\nadapt to changing conditions of the hydraulic gradient field.\nFirst, we use the model to explain the system behavior over\nthe course of a typical flood event. Then, we discuss factors\nthat may be responsible for either recurrent or variable\ncharacteristics of water table response during flood events.\n6.1. A Conceptual Model of Operating Mechanisms\n6.1.1. Rising Limb\n[30] The rise of the river induces a kinematic wave that\noperates analogously to piston flow [e.g., Anderson and\nBurt, 1982] by pushing \u2018\u2018old\u2019\u2019 floodplain water ahead and,\nhence, causes the river bank (H4, S4) and spur-floodplain\nwater table (S3, S2) to rise near-synchronously and by the\nsame amount. The hollow piezometer H3, although plotting\nabove river stage and indicating the presence of hillslope\nrunoff channeled through the hollow, also shows a rising\nwater table but at a much lower rate. Because of decreasing\nhydraulic gradients, and hence decreasing fluxes toward the\nspur transect and the river, the water table at H3 will tend to\nrise as a result.\n[31] Kinematic wave processes are well known in hydrol-\nogy (see, for example, the review by Singh [2002]) and can\nbe triggered by a rapidly rising river. There are several\narguments that support the kinematic wave hypothesis here.\nFirst, flux velocities associated with Darcian flow are in the\nrange of 10\u00024\u201310\u00025 m h\u00021 given a saturated hydraulic\nconductivity of 10\u00025\u201310\u00026 m s\u00021 at the field site and\nmaximum water table gradients of only a few percent.\nThese flow velocities are at least five to six orders of\nFigure 9. Water table elevation at H3 and S3 as a function\nof the hillslope piezometer S1. Only the period when the\nlocations were not inundated during the rising and recession\nperiods of all four over-bank (A, D, E, G) events are shown\nin chronological order from light gray to black. While the\nwater table within the floodplain hollow (H3) follows the\nbehavior of the water table of the hillslope piezometer (S1)\nduring events (plotting parallel to the H3 = S1 line), no such\nrelationship is evident along the spur transect.\nFigure 10. River stage\u2013hydraulic head hysteresis plots for representative sensors (S4, S2, H3, S1)\nduring the event sequence. The dash-dotted line gives the y = x relationship (identical water table level).\nData from events B, C, D, E, and F are shown in chronological order from light gray to black. Note the\nprogressive rising of the water table at the hillslope sensor S1, while the water table responses at the river\nbanks and spur transect tend to converge against the behavior of river stage as the sequence proceeds,\nindicated by a progressively closer alignment of the data points along the y = x line.\n10 of 13\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE W12409\nmagnitude too low to lead to mass transfer over the\ndistances involved in the time available and cannot explain\nthe strong relationship between piezometers and river\nbehavior. Second, the response of the water table to the\nriver stage during in-bank conditions is synchronous or\nnearly synchronous over \u000170 m lateral distance of flood-\nplain adjacent to the river channel and often associated with\na rather planar rise of the water table. Thirdly, a wave-like\nresponse of the water table to a rapid increase in river stage\nis indicated in Figure 11. Here, the water table response to\nthe impulse induced by the rapidly rising river is delayed by\na few hours, which implies wave velocities of the order of\nmeters or tens of meters per hour. This matches the order of\nmagnitude of flux velocities that are required to explain the\nrapid response of the floodplain water table to river stage\nchanges.\n6.1.2. Flood Peak\n[32] The rising water tables at the hillslope-floodplain\nboundary around the flood peak are not caused by the\ngroundwater ridge driving water into this area but result\nfrom the accumulation of hillslope water, which is dammed\nby the presence of the ridge. There are three main reasons to\nsupport this hypothesis. First, flux velocities are too low to\nexplain the rising water tables. Second, if the water had\noriginated from the groundwater ridge, the water table\nwould fall just as quickly again after the disappearance of\nthe ridge, which is not the case. Thirdly, we have already\nshown in section 5.5 that the water table at the hillslope-\nfloodplain boundary starts to rise before the ridge exists.\nThis interpretation is also supported by the tracer modeling\nstudy of Claxton et al. [2003] at this site.\n[33] The development of a groundwater ridge has im-\nportant implications since it temporarily prevents hillslope\nwater from reaching the floodplain and thereby limits\nhillslope contributions to flood waves propagating down-\nstream. A groundwater ridge will develop if the floodplain\nwater table rises above the water table at the hillslope-\nfloodplain boundary; its formation is therefore controlled\nby both river stage and hillslope runoff conditions. In\nsummer and autumn when little or no hillslope runoff\noccurs and preevent floodplain water tables are low, a\ngroundwater ridge may develop during in-bank events\n[Burt et al., 2002b]. This is, however, unlikely to occur\nduring the winter wet season, since hillslope discharge will\nsustain high water tables at the back of the floodplain; the\ntypical base flow conditions associated with a weak\nhydraulic gradient toward the river will therefore tend to\nbe maintained during in-bank winter flood events. On the\nbasis of the presence or absence of a groundwater ridge,\nwe calculate that hillslope discharge on to the floodplain\nwas switched off for 28 days (\u000115% of the period studied)\nof the \u00016 month winter flood season, with event A in\nOctober 1998 alone accounting for 14 days. Of course,\nswitching off of hillslope contributions to the channel\nhappens much more readily as soon as river stage exceeds\nthe elevation of the floodplain water table, a condition that\nlasted for \u00012 months (one-third of the period) during the\n1998\u20131999 winter.\n[34] Unfortunately, these findings cannot be regarded as\nbeing representative at the reach scale since Stewart et al.\n[1999] showed that considerable hillslope contributions\nenter the channel along this section of the river during\nflood events, which would be impossible if a groundwater\nridge developed everywhere along the floodplain. Hydro-\nlogical short circuiting between hillslope and river can occur\nwhen the floodplain is close to adjoining hillslopes, or as a\nresult of agricultural drainage. In this respect, areas at the\nback of the floodplain where the occurrence of short\ncircuiting is likely deserve particular attention for land use\nand flood prevention management.\n6.1.3. Recession Limb\n[35] Given that floodplain water tables immediately\nfollow the declining river stage, the same kinematic\nprocess is likely to operate as during the rising period\nbut in the opposite direction, i.e., water drains out of the\nfloodplain instead of being pushed in. The recession\nperiod typically goes through a transition from a nearly\nhorizontal water table to a horizontal water table at the\nback of the floodplain with lateral gradients to the river\nin the near-channel area, to a fully three-dimensional\npattern caused by high water tables in the floodplain\nhollow related to hillslope runoff. The persistence of the\ngroundwater dome within the floodplain hollow through-\nout the winter season during low river discharge is\nlargely an effect of low Darcian flow velocities within\nthe floodplain.\n6.2. Recurring Patterns and Interevent Differences\n[36] Considering the factors that control or influence\nfloodplain water table behavior during flood events, two\nFigure 11. River stage change (thick black line) and water level change (dotted line) over time for\nrepresentative sensors from a subset of the rising period of event G to illustrate the rapid, wave-like\nresponse of the water table to a period of rapid river stage changes. The rates of change were smoothed\nwith a three-point moving average to remove some high-frequency noise.\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE\n11 of 13\nW12409\ngroups can be distinguished. First, factors that can be\nassumed to be constant, which change only on timescales\nof landscape evolution. Among these are the morphology\nof the floodplain and adjacent hillslopes, the sedimentary\narchitecture and material properties, including the connec-\ntivity between channel and alluvial aquifer. These have\ncrucial importance for water table dynamics by determin-\ning inundation patterns, hillslope runoff inputs and prefer-\nential flow paths (PFPs). These factors provide the\nframework within which water table fluctuations take\nplace, confine the system behavior into a distinct region\nof possible system states and, hence, produce recurring\npatterns of water table response. In this respect, we have\nrecognized several distinctive patterns of water table\nresponse at the study site. First, we identified a group of\npiezometers near the river bank (S4, H4) and a group\nfurther away from the river along the spur transect (S3,\nS2), which are strongly controlled by river stage alone.\nThis cannot be simply explained by the distance to the\nriver since, for example, S2 is more strongly correlated\nwith river stage than S3, despite being 30 m further away\nfrom the river with a 0.8 m higher. This effect was\npreviously recognized by Burt et al. [2002b] who specu-\nlated about the influence of possible buried channel fea-\ntures at the site which might act as PFPs. Second, we\nrecognized a group of piezometers at the back of the\nfloodplain (S1, H1 and H2) whose behavior reflects hill-\nslope runoff inputs on the one hand and an accumulation\neffect of hillslope water on the other, the latter becoming\nsignificant during periods of elevated floodplain water\ntables that slow or even dam the flux toward the river.\nThis accumulation effect also characterizes the behavior of\nthe piezometer H3 within the floodplain hollow that serves\nas conduit of hillslope discharge. Although the water table\nat H3 remains higher than river stage until the location gets\ninundated, the water table at H3 rises slowly when the river\nrises because this prevents water discharging from the\nfloodplain to the river. Hence hillslope water accumulates\nwithin the floodplain hollow during the rising limbs of\nevents which causes the water table there to rise.\n[37] In conclusion, different mechanisms act and interact\nat different locations within the floodplain which are stable\nover time and reproduce typical sequences of water table\nmorphologies over the course of flood events. However,\nsome differences of water table response and water table\nappearance can be identified between events which are\nattributed to the second group of factors that influence\nfloodplain water table fluctuations.\n[38] Factors influencing water table fluctuations which\nare subject to short-term variations can alter the system\nbehavior within the space given by morphological and\nsedimentary controls, and are therefore the reason for\npatterns deviating between events. The shape and magni-\ntude of the river hydrograph is clearly most important since\nriver stage changes drive floodplain water table fluctuations\nduring events as shown previously. Varying hillslope inputs\nas a function of local rainfall and antecedent conditions may\ninterfere with the river-controlled water table patterns,\nespecially in the near-hillslope area and along particular\nmorphological features such as the floodplain hollow at this\nfield site. However, water table response to hillslope inputs\nand river stage changes is highly dependent on moisture\nconditions in the unsaturated zone, as shown by several\nlines of evidence. First, the recession periods seem always\nto be characterized by similar patterns of water table\nbehavior when the floodplain is extensively saturated. By\ncontrast, interevent differences are most pronounced during\nrising periods where antecedent conditions may well be\ndifferent. Second, over the course of the event sequence, the\npiezometers that behave according to the river water level\nshowed better connectivity to the river once the floodplain\nhad been inundated during the first over-bank event in\nDecember 1998 (event D). Water tables responded quicker\nto river stage changes, following closely the y = x function\ngraph during the subsequent events E and F. Third, the\npattern of water table response during the rising period of\nevent A in autumn 1998 is different to all subsequent events\nbecause the floodplain was dry prior to the first out-of-bank\nevent, as indicated by a low, horizontal prestorm water\ntable, no sign of hillslope runoff and no elevated river levels\nin the preceding period. This suggests a critical role for the\npreevent condition of the unsaturated zone and the capillary\nfringe in determining water table response.\n[39] Contrasting antecedent moisture conditions in con-\njunction with the initial absence of hillslope discharge are\nlikely to be responsible for the discrepancy between the\npattern of event A and those that followed. The system\nundergoes a rapid transition from the dry \u2018\u2018summer mode\u2019\u2019\nwithout continuous hillslope fluxes to the wet \u2018\u2018winter\nmode\u2019\u2019 with sustained hillslope discharge during event A.\nA wet floodplain with high soil moisture content is typical\nfor the winter season at this field site [Claxton et al., 2003]\nand may assist in generating a rapid water table rise with\nrecurring characteristics, as is evident for all events consid-\nered except event A. These findings are in accordance with\nthe reach-scale water balance modeling study of Stewart et\nal. [1999] who also identified distinct behavior during the\nfirst flood event of 1993\u20131994 winter season. Stewart et al.\n[1999] assessed inflows and outflows to a 40 km reach of\nthe Severn between the gauging stations at Montford Bridge\nand Buildwas, which are upstream and downstream respec-\ntively of the Leighton field site. To do this, Stewart et al.\n[1999] analyzed gauged main stem and tributary flows, and\nsupplemented this with hydrological models of the unga-\nuged tributaries and hillslopes adjacent to the floodplain in\norder to close the floodplain water mass balance. The first\nwinter event was found to be the only one of the whole\n1993\u20131994 flood season where the outflow discharge from\nthe reach at Buildwas was lagged and attenuated compared\nto the sum of all inflows. For all other events up to 20%\nmore water was gauged at Buildwas than was gauged\nentering the reach.\n7. Summary and Conclusions\n[40] We have identified and discussed patterns of flood-\nplain water table fluctuations during flood events of the\nwinter season 1998\u20131999 within a lowland reach of the\nRiver Severn, England. These patterns have three-dimen-\nsional characteristics and reveal clear spatial and temporal\nregularity. We attribute the constancy of patterns to sedi-\nmentary and morphological controls on the floodplain and\nadjoining hillslopes. Spatially, we have identified areas\nwithin the floodplain of similar water table response, some\n12 of 13\nW12409 JUNG ET AL.: FLOODPLAIN WATER TABLE RESPONSE W12409\nclosely related to river stage changes while others are slope\ncontrolled. Temporally, the pattern of water table fluctuation\nover the course of a flood event is essentially repetitive for\ncomparable river hydrographs. Deviations are caused by\nlow antecedent soil moisture, which can slow water table\nresponse significantly and induce irregularity. This is the\ncase for early autumn events, when the capillary fringe is\ninitially underdeveloped but during which the catchment\nand the floodplain undergo a wetting-up transition with\nimplications for the water table response and the propaga-\ntion of flood waves downstream during later events [see\nStewart et al., 1999].\n[41] We have proposed a conceptual, three-dimensional\nmodel of floodplain water table response, which incorporates\na piston flow process due to rapidly rising river water levels\nand the impact of hillslope contributions to the floodplain.\nThe former process can be interpreted as a kinematic wave,\nwhere river water entering the floodplain through the river\nbanks pushes older floodplain water ahead of it and causes a\nrapid water table response over many tens of meters across\nthe floodplain, a response that cannot be accomplished by\nDarcian flow alone. The development of a groundwater ridge\nat the time of the flood peak dams hillslope inputs and forces\nthe water table at the floodplain-hillslope boundary to rise.\nDuring the recession limb, and low-flow conditions in\ngeneral, hillslope discharge along a hillslope hollow causes\nlocalized elevated water levels and three-dimensional flow\npatterns within the floodplain.\n[42] A thorough test of our model will require a series of\ncareful tracer experiments to determine source, path, and\nvelocity of flow within the floodplain and its extension to\nother sites to determine its wider relevance. We believe the\nprocesses identified will generally apply to river-floodplain\nsystems with perennial discharge and a good connection\nbetween river and floodplain aquifer. However, the interac-\ntions between hillslope runoff and the spatial response\npatterns on the floodplain are obviously site-specific, con-\ntrolled by local topography and sedimentary architecture.\nNevertheless, the geomorphology of our study site (wide\nfloodplains bounded by much steeper hillslopes) is typical of\nmany European river corridors. In summary, we believe the\nprocesses we have identified will be common for this class of\nsystem but may find subtly different expression depending\non the exact geomorphological and climatic setting.\nReferences\nAnderson, M.
