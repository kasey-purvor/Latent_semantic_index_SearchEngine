Honary \nIndexing term: Binary sequences \nA new class of polyphase sequences with two-valued periodic \nauto- and crosscorrelation properties is proposed. It is proved \nthat, for a given prime length L > 3, the out-of-phase ACFs and \nCCFs of the sequences are constant and equal to dL. It is also \nshown that sequences of the same length are mutually orthogonal \nand the correlation values asymptotically reach the Sarwate \nbound. \nIntroduction: Sets of sequences with good correlation properties \nhave found application in radar, ranging and tracking, spread- \nspectrum communications, multiple-access communications, and \nsystem identification. For the correlation method of system identi- \nfication, it is especially desirable that the out-of-phase autocorrela- \ntion functions (ACFs) of a sequence be constant. For multiple- \naccess communication purposes it is also desirable that the pair- \nwise crosscorrelation functions (CCFs) between sequences assigned \nto various users be small, and preferably constant. There are many \nwell-known classes of sequences having two-valued ACFs and \nsmall CCFs. For example, maximal length sequences, quadratic \nresidue sequences, Frank sequences, Chu sequences, Liike \nsequences, etc. [ 1 4 .  In this Letter, a new class of polyphase \nsequences with near-optimal two-valued ACFs and CCFs is pro- \nposed. It is proved that, for a given prime length L > 3, the out- \nof-phase ACFs and CCFs of the sequences are constant and equal \nto d L  An interesting and useful property of these sequences is \nthat all the sequences of the same length L are mutually orthogo- \nnal. It is shown that the correlation values asymptotically reach \nthe Sarwate hound. \nSequences with two-valued ACFs and CCFs: For any integers r, n \nand prime L > 3, where 0 s n, r < L, the new class of polyphase \nsequences, a(\" = (U&'', a,(\", ..., aLf l ) ,  is defined as \n(1) = an(n+l)(n+2)\/6+rn a = eiZav\/L \nwhere a is a primitive Lth root of unity and Y is any integer rela- \ntively prime to L. Obviously there exist L sequences each of length \nL for any prime L > 3. \nWe now show that the above sequences have the following \nACF\/CCF properties: \n(3) \nThe squared absolute value of the periodic CCF R,,,(T) between \nsequence a(') and sequence a($) is defmed as \nn=O m=0 \nSubstituting eqn. 1 into eqn. 4, we obtain \nELECTRONICS LETTERS 23rd June 1994 Vol. 30 \nL-1 - ,n(n+l)(n+2)\/E+~n-(n+r)(n+~+l)(n+r+2)\/6-~(n+~) \nn=O \nL-1 ~ ~ - m ( m + l ~ m + 2 ) \/ 6 - r m + ( m + r X m + r + l ) ( m + ~ + 2 ) \/ 6 + ~ ( m + T )  \nVL=O \nL-1 \n= a-r(2+6n+3na+3r+3nr+~z)\/6-(s-r)n-sT \nn=O \nL-1 \na~(2+6m+3m2+3r+3mr+~z)\/6-(~-~)m-sr \nm=O \n= a~[6(m-n)+3(nz-nz)+3r(m--n)]\/6+(s--r)(n-n) \nL-1 L-1 \nn=O m=O \nL-1 L-1 \n= C ,(m-n)[f(r+m+n+2)\/2+(s-r)] \nn=O m=O \n(5) \nWhen T = 0. it is obvious that \nWhen T # 0, we introduce the following change of variables: \nn = m + 1  I = 0,1, .  . . , L  - 1 ( 7) \nIR,,,(T)I* can then be rewritten as \nL-1 L-1 \nl ~ ~ . , .

Therefore the above \nsequences are asymptotically optimal. \nExample: As a simple example, let L = 7; we obtain seven distinct \nsequences: \nd o )  = (1, a ,  a4, a3, as, 1, 1) \na(') = (1, 012, a8, (Ye, a3, a5, a6) \na(2) = (1, a3, a, 2, 1, 013, a5) \na(3) = (1, a4, a3, a5, a4, a, a4) \nd 4 )  = (1, a5, a5, a, a, ae, a3) \na(5) = (1, a6, 1, a4, 0 5 ,  a4, a2) \na@) = (1, 1, a2, 1, a2, 0 2 ,  a)  \nwhere a = P'.

Examples of the \ncodes are presented for 2,4,8, 16 and 32 states. The codes achieve \na coding gain of 1.76dB (for two encoder states) to 5.44dB (for 32 \nencoder states) compared to the uncoded BPSK. Distance profiles \nof the codes are shown. \nZntrorhtction: When QPSK signals are encoded with a linear, rate \n1\/2, convolutional code, it is only possible to achieve code invari- \nance under 180\" signal rotation with certain codes, whereas with \nother codes no such invariance exists [l]. The lack of invariance \nfor 90\" signal rotations requites that the QPSK signals be demod- \nulated with the c o m t  phase before Viterbi decoding. New non- \nlinear 90\" rotation invariant coded QPSK schemes were found in \n[U \nAnother approach to the above problem is considered in this \nLetter. We consider linear TCM schemes with a 3-D constellation \nfor sending one information bit per signalling interval. Each signal \nelement is transmitted in the two consecutive signalling intervals as \na pair of 2PSK and 4PSK symbols (Fig. la). This technique has \nbeen used previously with 4PSK-8PSK [2]. \nFor coherent detection we have to extract the camer phase \nfrom the received signal. In our case, for 2PSK4PSK modulation \nwe have the option of performing synchronisation with only two \nphase states (on the 2PSK signal set). Thus only 180\" synchronisa- \ntion is required, increasing the robustness of the demodulator to \nnoise. When 2PSK-4PSK signals are encoded, it is possible to eas- \nily achieve code invariance under 180\" signal rotation. Such codes \nwere found for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 encoder states. \n3 - 0  signal configuration and its partitioning: Each signal element in \nthe 3-D signal space is created by 2PSK and 4PSK signals trans- \nmitted in two consecutive signalling intervals.

After set partitioning and state transition diagram \ndefinition the signal elements are assigned to the encoder state \ntransitions. The assignment is performed such that the three \nUngerboeck rules [4] are applied and rule AI [3] is satisfied. To \ndescribe the code we use the parity check equation as given in [4]. \nThe encoder in Fig. 2 has (in octal notation) h2 = 04, h' = 02 and \nho = 11. Because \"(D) = D3 0 1 and H(1) = 0, the code is 180\" \ninvariant [7]. Distance d2_, for the code of Fig. 2 is 10, hence the \nasymptotic coding gain of the code compared to uncoded BPSK is \n101og(10\/4) = 3.98dB. Because Y,Y, do not change on phase rota- \ntion, a differential encoder is not necessary. \nTable 1: Code examples \nU I k I h2 hl ho I &,* I N f ,  I y \nI I I I I dB \n1032 ELECTRONICS LETTERS 23rd June 1994 Vol. 30 No. 13 \n~~~ \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.
