This paper outlines an analogous \nmethod for identifying candidate causes of reading comprehension failure, the \n\"comprehension-age match design\", and discusses the strengths and limitations of this \ndesign. \n \nKeywords:  reading comprehension, causal relations, word reading accuracy, ability-\nmatch designs \n3 \nIntroduction \n \n Children's failure to understand written text can arise at different stages in the \nprocessing of language. For example, children with impoverished vocabularies and\/or \nthose who experience difficulties in word reading can fail to understand sentences and \nlonger pieces of text (e.g. Liberman & Shankweiler, 1991; Perfetti, 1985). In addition, \nthere exists a group of children who demonstrate reading comprehension problems in \nthe presence of age-appropriate word reading and vocabulary skills (e.g. Oakhill, \n1994; Stothard & Hulme, 1996). Oakhill and colleagues have shown that such \nchildren experience problems with a range of higher-level reading-related skills, such \nas inference making, comprehension monitoring, and anomaly resolution (de Sousa & \nOakhill 1996; Oakhill, 1982, 1984; Yuill, Oakhill & Parkin, 1989).   \n However, the finding that skilled comprehenders make, for example, more \ninferences than less skilled comprehenders is essentially correlational. It does not tell \nus anything about the direction of the relation between these two skills. It may be that \nthe skilled comprehenders' greater experience of reading and understanding stories has \nstrengthened their inferential skill, relative to that of the less-skilled comprehenders. \nAlternatively, it may be that the less-skilled comprehenders' poorer inferential skill \nhas (at least in part) caused their poorer comprehension.   \n Three types of experimental investigation can be used to help to determine \nwhether or not strength in one skill, such as inference making ability, is the result or \ncause of strength in another skill, such as reading comprehension.  These methods are: \nlongitudinal investigations, training\/intervention studies, and ability-match \ncomparisons. Although causal hypotheses are best tested by the first two methods, \nthese types of investigation are both time consuming and costly endeavours and, \ntherefore, only worth pursuing once candidate causes have been identified.  \n The third method of investigation, using an ability-match comparison, is to \ninclude a control group that is matched to the less skilled comprehenders on the \nvariable which this group has lagged behind, i.e. on comprehension age. This design \n4 \nis analogous to the widely used reading-age match design in which the performance of \nbackward readers on the task(s) of interest is compared to that of younger children \nwho are matched with the backward readers for word reading skill (e.g. Bradley & \nBryant, 1978). The argument here is that if the reading-age match (or RAM) control \ngroup does better than the backward readers on some task, such as rhyme detection, \nthis difference cannot be said to be a product of the two groups' word reading levels \nsince the groups are at the same level of word reading. It is, therefore, more likely that \nthe difference is associated with the cause of the backward readers' delayed reading. \nThe RAM design has proved a popular method for identifying candidate causes of \ndelayed or deficient word reading skills (e.g. Frith & Snowling, 1983; Siegel & Ryan, \n1988; Stanovich, Nathan & Vala-Rossi, 1986).  \n  For just the same reason, Cain and Oakhill (1996) have advocated an ability-\nmatch design to help establish whether or not particular skills are the result of good \nreading comprehension (see also Stothard & Hulme, 1992). The comparison of, for \nexample, the inferential skills of less skilled comprehenders to those of a younger \ngroup of equivalent comprehension ability, a comprehension-age match (or CAM) \ngroup, could help to determine which is the more plausible explanation for the \nrelation between the two skills: Does proficiency in inference making lead to good \nreading comprehension, or does good reading comprehension result in superior \ninference making? If the comprehension-age match group make more inferences than \nthe less skilled comprehenders, we can rule out the possibility that superior inference \nskill is the result of superior reading comprehension in general, because the CAM \ngroup and less skilled comprehenders are matched on this variable. This result would \nidentify children's inferential skills as a likely cause of the level of their reading \ncomprehension, a hypothesis which can then be explored further with longitudinal \ndesigns and training studies.  \n In recent work using the comprehension-age match design, we have found that \nless skilled comprehenders generate significantly fewer inferences than both skilled \ncomprehenders and a comprehension-age match group (Cain & Oakhill, 1998).  This \n5 \nfinding suggests that good inference making ability is not the product of reading \ncomprehension level for the reasons discussed above.  Instead, we conclude that it is \nmore likely that inference making skill facilitates comprehension development, a \nhypothesis which we are currently pursuing in a longitudinal study. \n The nature of the test that we routinely use in our work (the Neale Analysis of \nReading Ability - Revised British Edition, Neale, 1989) requires that additional \nmeasures are taken to establish that the groups in this design are adequately matched, \nan issue that will be discussed further below. In addition, it is necessary to verify a \ncrucial assumption of the CAM design: That the younger comprehenders have not had \ngreater reading experience than the older poor comprehenders. This assumption is \nobviously more contentious than the analogous assumption in the RAM design where \nthe crucial dependent variable is word reading skill, rather than comprehension skill. \nRelevant reading experience might also include the experience of listening to stories, \nwhich might of course influence comprehension but is unlikely to influence word \nreading. It is possible that the younger, CAM, group have had greater reading \nexperience, at least in this broader sense. However, we have evidence that this is not \nthe case, discussed below. Using data from our recent work, we first outline how we \nhave selected groups for this design, and then discuss these two points, in turn. \n \nGroup selection \n In our recent work using the comprehension-age match design (e.g. Cain & \nOakhill, 1996, 1998) we have used two tests in the selection process. One was the \nvocabulary subtest of the Gates-MacGinitie Primary Two Test (MacGinitie & \nMacGinitie, 1989, Gates & MacGinitie, 1965) which indicates a child's ability to read \nand understand isolated words. This test was used to screen out exceptional readers, \ni.e. those children who performed either very badly or very well. The remaining \n\"average\" performers were tested on Form One of the Neale Analysis of Reading \nAbility - Revised British Edition (Neale, 1989). The Neale test consists of a series of \nshort self-contained stories, graded in difficulty. Children read each story aloud and \n6 \nany words that are misread or refused by the child are supplied by the tester. After \neach story they are asked a series of questions about the story. Testing stops after the \nchild has made a prescribed number of word reading errors, i.e. no further stories are \nattempted once this limit is reached. Because word reading errors are corrected, \nchildren will have read or had read to them all the words in a story that they are \nsubsequently asked questions about. Therefore, in this test, ability to answer \ncomprehension questions is not as dependent upon word reading skill as it is in other \nassessments of reading comprehension. The Neale provides separate age equivalent \nscores for both word reading accuracy, based on the number of words that a child is \nunable to read or misreads, and reading comprehension, based on the number of \nquestions about the stories that the child answers correctly.  \n Less skilled comprehenders. In our studies we have usually seen children aged \nbetween 7-8 years who have age-appropriate word reading accuracy. However, all of \nour less skilled comprehenders have comprehension ages that are below their \nchronological ages and at least 6 months below their word reading accuracy age.  The \ncharacteristics of typical groups are shown in table 1.  \n------------------------------------  \nTABLE 1 AROUND HERE \n------------------------------------  \n Skilled comprehenders. These children have always been selected from the \nsame classes as the less-skilled comprehenders. Their word reading accuracy ages are \nalso within the \"normal\" range for their chronological age, and their comprehension \nscores are either at or above that predicted by their word reading accuracy ages.  The \nskilled and less skilled comprehender groups are always matched on the following \nvariables: chronological age, Neale word reading accuracy, and Gates-MacGinitie \nvocabulary scores, but are selected to differ in terms of Neale reading comprehension \nperformance.  An example of typical group characteristics is shown in table 1.  The \nmean reading comprehension ages of the two groups of skilled and less skilled \ncomprehenders shown in table 1 were significantly different, t(24) = 10.45, p < .001. \n7 \nThe two groups were matched for Neale word reading accuracy, t(24) < 1.0, and \nGates-MacGinitie vocabulary scores, t(24) < 1.0. Thus, we can assume that the less-\nskilled comprehenders' performance, relative to that of the skilled group, was not \npoorer because of some general reading disability, but was a specific text-level \ncomprehension deficit.   \n Comprehension-age match (CAM) group. This group comprises children aged \n6-7 years who are also progressing normally in their reading: Both their word reading \naccuracy and reading comprehension ages are within 6 months of their chronological \nage and there is never more than 6 months difference between the two scores. This \ngroup is selected so that their mean comprehension age is not significantly different \nfrom that of the less-skilled comprehenders (t(24) < 1.0, for the groups shown in table \n1).   \n \nAre the groups adequately matched for comprehension skill? \n We turn now to the first point raised above: How the nature of the test \ninstrument (in this case the Neale) may pose problems for such a design. As table 1 \nillustrates, the less skilled comprehenders read more stories during the Neale test than \nthe younger CAM group: 3.29 compared to 2.50, t(24) = 4.04, p < .001, because their \nword reading was superior.  This difference was to be expected because all groups had \nword reading skills which were commensurate with their chronological age and the \nless-skilled comprehenders were older than the CAM group. Thus, it is possible that \nthe assessment of the CAM group's comprehension skill was constrained by their \nword reading skill and that if they had been able to read more stories and, thus, \nattempt a greater number of comprehension questions, their general comprehension \nability may have been found to be greater. Additional comparisons were necessary to \nensure: i) that the less skilled and CAM groups were adequately matched for \ncomprehension ability and ii) that the older skilled comprehenders were of superior \ncomprehension ability to this younger group and had not simply obtained higher \nscores as a consequence of having read more stories.   \n8 \n The raw comprehension scores were reanalysed excluding the scores on the \nstories that had been too difficult for the younger CAM group. Because of unequal \nsample sizes, we were unable to conduct this analysis on a matched pair basis for the \ngroups shown in table 1. Instead we compared performance in the following way. \nFour CAM children had successfully completed 3 stories during the Neale assessment. \nThey were 'paired' with four less-skilled comprehenders who were of the same \nabsolute comprehension level and also with four skilled comprehenders of \ncomparable word reading ability to these four less skilled comprehenders. The total \nnumber of questions that these children had answered correctly in the first three \nstories of the Neale were the scores used in the analysis. All of the other CAM \nchildren read two stories. Therefore, for all remaining children (skilled \ncomprehenders, less skilled comprehenders and the comprehension-age match \nchildren) only the number of questions answered correctly on the first two stories of \nthe Neale test were included in this re-analysis. In this way, we were able to compare \ncomprehension ability between the groups for only the stories that the CAM group \nhad successfully read. The pattern of data was the same as that obtained in the original \nreading comprehension assessment (using the Neale test): less-skilled comprehenders \n= 8.71 (sd = 1.90), skilled comprehenders = 12.67 (sd = 3.17), and CAM group = 9.58 \n(sd = 1.24). As expected, the difference between the less skilled comprehenders and \nthe comprehension-age match group was not significant, t(24) = 1.36, but the \ndifference between the skilled comprehenders and the comprehension-age match \ngroup was significant, t(22) = 3.14, p < .01. Thus, we can be confident that, in this \nsample, the less-skilled and comprehension-age match groups were accurately \nmatched for comprehension skill and, in addition, that the skilled comprehenders and \ncomprehension-age match group differed in comprehension skill. A similar pattern of \nresults has been obtained with different samples of subjects (Cain & Oakhill, 1996, \n1998). \n An additional check of our initial (Neale) comprehension matching would be \nto compare performance on a listening comprehension task. Stothard and Hulme \n9 \n(1992) report comparable patterns of data for listening and reading comprehension \namong 3 experimental groups selected in a similar manner to our own. We have \nreplicated Stothard and Hulme's findings for the three groups described above. In our \nstudy the children listened to the first 4 stories of the Neale Analysis (Form 2) and \nwere asked the set questions after each passage. The mean scores were: less skilled = \n8.93 (sd = 3.85), skilled = 16.67 (sd = 3.96), and CAM = 10.0 (sd = 2.17). The skilled \ncomprehenders answered significantly more questions correctly than both the less \nskilled group, t(24) = 5.04, p < .0001, and the comprehension-age match group, t(22) \n= 5.11, p < .001. There was no significant difference between the less skilled \ncomprehenders and the comprehension-age match group, t(24) < 1.0. \n \nDo the comprehension-age match group have greater reading experience than the \nolder less skilled comprehenders?  \n We now turn to the second issue raised above. It is possible that, in such a \ndesign, the younger comprehension-age match group may have greater reading \nexperience than the older less skilled comprehenders. Such a difference may be the \ncause of positive test differences. For instance, Perfetti (1994) proposes that a possible \nsource of comprehension failure is inadequate knowledge about text structures, which \nmay arise because of insufficient reading experience. Indeed, a relation between \nchildren's reading comprehension and the time they spend reading has been found \n(Anderson, Wilson, & Fielding, 1988; Cipielewski & Stanovich, 1992; Taylor, Frye, \n& Maruyama, 1990).  \n It seems unlikely that children a year younger than our less skilled \ncomprehenders would have had greater exposure to print overall and, in view of their \ninferior word reading skills, we might expect their print experiences to date to be \nqualitatively different to those of the older less skilled comprehenders. In addition if, \nas research has shown, exposure to print is related to word reading ability (e.g. Allen, \nCipielewski, & Stanovich, 1992; Greaney, 1980; Greaney & Hegarty, 1987; \nStainthorp, 1997a) we might speculate that younger children who had greater levels of \n10 \nprint exposure than our older participants would have been better word readers \nanyway and would therefore have been excluded from our study in the initial selection \nprocess because their word reading accuracy would have been above the norm. \nHowever, as noted earlier, it is possible that the CAM children had more exposure to \nprint in the form of listening to stories, which may have affected their reading \ncomprehension skills. \n In response to these speculations we report data from a proxy measure of print \nexposure that employed a similar method to the Author and Title Recognition Tests \ndeveloped by Stanovich and colleagues (e.g. Cipielewski & Stanovich, 1992; \nCunningham & Stanovich, 1990; Stanovich & West, 1989). We developed an Author \nRecognition Test by selecting popular children's writers using information provided \nby the local public library and local book shops, and from reference books targeted at \nchildren's librarians (1). On the basis of pilot work with 6-7 and 7-8-year-olds we \nselected 32 authors for our experimental list. Each had written at least two books \ntargeted at the 5-12 year range. In addition, each author was known by at least one \nchild from either age group but none were familiar to all. In the experiment proper, we \nassessed children's recognition of these names taking into account their false \n\"recognition\" of foil names, to adjust for response bias (2). The dependent variable \nwas a measure of d-prime.  \n The test was given to 13 less-skilled, 12 skilled comprehenders, and 15 \ncomprehension-age match children, selected according to the criteria outlined above. \nThe d-prime scores were: less skilled comprehenders = .62 (sd = .37), skilled \ncomprehenders = .73 (sd = .24), and CAM = .33 (sd = .68).  The difference between \nthe skilled and CAM group tended towards significance, t(24) = 1.95, p < .065, but \nmore importantly, there was no indication of a difference between the two older \ngroups (t(24) < 1.0) and no evidence that the younger CAM group had greater \nexposure to print than the less skilled comprehenders. Instead our data followed the \npattern of word reading accuracy differences between our groups. \n \n11 \n \nDiscussion \n \n In this paper we have outlined the logic behind the comprehension-age match \ngroup and the confirmatory checks on reading assessment scores that are necessary to \nensure that groups are adequately matched. Furthermore, we have found no evidence \nthat the younger CAM group has greater print exposure than the older less skilled \ncomprehenders. Thus, we conclude that where less skilled comprehenders are found \nto be poorer on a task than children of comparable comprehension skill the result \ncannot simply have arisen through differences in reading comprehension performance.  \nInstead, this finding identifies the skill of interest as a candidate cause of good \ncomprehension.  \n There are obvious limitations with this design. Null results are ambiguous to \ninterpret and there is always the possibility that the pattern of data found is actually \nthe result of a tertium quid, an additional cognitive skill which is mediating the link \nbetween two variables (see Bryant & Goswami, 1986). For example, early vocabulary \nability may predict later reading comprehension skill because the vocabulary measure \nmay be a surrogate measure of intelligence. Thus, the relation between vocabulary and \ncomprehension skill could be via this variable. It is, thus, advisable to take such \nfactors into account, when exploring further the preliminary findings obtained with \ndesigns such as the one described here. A series of planned regression analyses is one \ntechnique available to control for the possible mediating influence of other cognitive \nfactors (e.g. Reynolds, 1992; Shirey & Reynolds, 1988). \n To conclude, it must be noted that a difference between less skilled \ncomprehenders and a comprehension-age match group does not prove causality. \nHowever, it indicates that strengths in the skill being measured are more plausibly the \ncause of reading comprehension success, than the result of it. Such positive findings \n(e.g. Cain & Oakhill, 1996, 1998) can then be followed up with more time-consuming \n12 \nand costly designs such as longitudinal or intervention studies, to provide a more \nstringent test of this hypothesis.  \n \n \n \n13 \nFootnotes \n \n(1)  We found that a Title Recognition Test was not as sensitive as the Author \nRecognition Test. This may be, as Stainthorp (1997b) has noted, because of the \npopularity of serialising children's books on television and radio in the UK. \n \n(2)  We actually used a 2-Alternative Forced Choice task to reduce subject bias, and \nthe Signal Detection Theory model of memory processes (Macmillan & Creelman, \n1991; McNicol, 1972; Snodgrass & Corwin, 1988). \n14 \nAcknowledgements \n \nOur work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council in the form of \na studentship awarded to Kate Cain and a research grant (R000 23 5438) awarded to \nJane Oakhill and Peter Bryant.
