It enables students to \ncreate their own interpretations of museum visits \nthrough descriptions of objects, images and sounds. \nThese are automatically transmitted to a personal \nonline gallery that they can use to reflect upon and \nshare their experience. This paper describes the \nLifecycle evaluations of MyArtSpace, throughout the \ndesign and deployment stages. \n \n1: Introduction  \nMyArtSpace is a service on mobile phones for \nenquiry-led museum learning, which also incorporates \na web portal for follow up learning after the museum \nvisit. It builds on research by ourselves and others into \nlearning with mobile technologies in museums, in \nparticular to provide links between museum experience \nand post-visit learning and reflection [1].  The service \nis currently undergoing trials in three UK museums: the \nUrbis museum of urban life in Manchester, the D-Day \nmuseum in Portsmouth, and the Study Gallery in Poole. \nAlthough it can be used for informal learning in \nmuseums, the service is particularly suited to school \nfield trips. Before the visit, the teacher will typically set \nan open-ended question that the students can answer by \ngathering and selecting evidence from the museum \nvisit. For example, for a visit by Key Stage 3 (US \nGrade 6-8) students on a history class to the D-Day \nMuseum (a museum to interpret the Allied landings \nduring World War II), the task was to collect evidence \nto assess whether D-Day was a triumph or a disaster for \nBritain.  \nAt the museum, students are given Nokia 6680 \nmultimedia mobile phones and each student registers a \npersonal identifier. They can \u2018collect\u2019 an exhibit by \ntyping its two-letter code into the handset, which then \ndisplays a multimedia presentation and automatically \nsends an image and description of the exhibit to their \npersonal collection area in a Web portal (see Figure 1a \nand 1b). The students are prompted to type in their \nreasons for collecting, encouraging them to reflect on \nwhat they see in the museum in relation to the learning \ntask. After collecting an object, the students are \nnotified of who else has collected it and encouraged to \nfind and talk with them face-to-face. In addition, the \nstudents can use the mobile phones to create their own \ninterpretation by taking photos, recording sounds, or \nwriting text comments (see Figure 1c and 1d). This \ncontent is also transmitted by the phone to their online \ncollection.  \n \n     \n(a)                                  (b) \n \n     \n(c)                                  (d) \n \nFigure 1. MyArtSpace mobile phone interface: \n(a) collecting an object, (b) multimedia \npresentation about collected object, (c) main \nmenu options, (d) taking photos \n \nBack at school, the students can view their personal \ncollections, the items collected by the whole class, as \nwell as content made available by the museum. \nThrough a web portal, the students can organize these \ncollections into personal galleries (like simple web-\nbased presentations), to present in the classroom or to \nshare with their family (see Figure 2). Access to the \nweb portal is password protected, and the content \npublished by the students is moderated to ensure \nprivacy protection and appropriate use. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. An example student gallery \n \nMyArtSpace was designed and developed by The \nSea (www.the-sea.com) and funded by Culture Online, \npart of the UK Department of Culture, Media and \nSports. The user experience and educational evaluation \nof MyArtSpace was carried out by a team of evaluators \nat the Centre for Educational Technology and Distance \nLearning at the University of Birmingham, and was \ndone in parallel with internal testing carried out by the \ndevelopers. This paper describes the evaluation \nactivities that were undertaken during the development \nand deployment of MyArtSpace, focusing on the \nLifecycle approach to evaluation that was adopted and \nthe user and educational evaluation activities.  \n \n2: The Lifecycle Evaluation Approach \nThe Lifecycle Evaluation Approach [2][3] places \nevaluation at the centre of the development process, \nfrom the very early stages of design to the final \nassessment of the technology. The approach draws on \nevaluation methods and ideas from software \nengineering, educational evaluation, and models for \nevaluating learning technology. Evaluation activities \nare undertaken at key points in the lifecycle of the \nsystem design process. The outcomes of each \nevaluation inform the next stage of the system \ndevelopment or feed into an iteration of an earlier \nstage. For example, the outcomes of an evaluation \nduring initial user trials inform decisions on how to \ndeploy the system and support the users. \nTo retain focus in planning and conducting each \nevaluation, key questions are addressed throughout: \n\u0001 Goals: Why is the evaluation being \nundertaken (its purposes and goals)? \n\u0001 Stakeholders: Who are the stakeholders and \nthe users? \n\u0001 Timetable: When should the evaluation \nactivities be undertaken? \n\u0001 Deliverables: How will the results be \ncommunicated? \n\u0001 Methods: What evaluation methods and \nresources will be used? \nThese questions enable the evaluation team to retain \nfocus on the task. For MyArtSpace, the stakeholders \nincluded the funding body, the development team, \nteachers, LEA (local education authority) \nrepresentatives, and museum curators and educational \nexperts. The overall goal of the evaluation was agreed \nby the key stakeholders to be the assessment of the \nservice\u2019s usability, accessibility, effectiveness, and \ncapability to engage the user. This broad goal was \nexpanded into a set of requirements following a user \nconsultation workshop that brought together \nrepresentatives from the key stakeholder groups. The \ntimetable, deliverables and evaluation methods were \nsubsequently designed and agreed with respect to the \nidentified requirements. \n \n3: Compiling and validating requirements \nThe requirements (112 in total) that emerged from \nthe user consultation workshop were divided into six \nmain categories: \n1. Teacher requirements: requirements for \ndesigning the teacher experience \n2. Student requirements: requirements for \ndesigning the student experience \n3. Museum requirements: requirements for \ndesigning the museum staff experience and \nalso institutional requirements \n4. Culture Online requirements: requirements \nrelevant to the funding body, pertaining to \noverall project objectives, qualitative and \nquantitative measurement criteria, etc. \n5. General system requirements: all other \nrequirements that did not directly concern a \nspecific group \n6. Usability requirements: requirements for \ndesigning an easy to use, easy to learn and \nenjoyable service\/system for all user groups \nRequirements identified in the above categories \nwere further characterised as educational (E) or user \n(U). Educational requirements related to the \neducational experience whereas user requirements \nconcerned functionality and performance.  \nOne of the key features of the Lifecycle Evaluation \nApproach is the early and continual involvement of \nstakeholders in the evaluation process in order to agree \npriorities and agendas. The initial set of requirements \nwas validated and prioritised through a further \nStakeholder Workshop, which brought together 16 \nrepresentatives from the main stakeholder groups. . The \nstakeholders who participated in the consultation \nworkshop followed through the evaluation process and \nwere involved in the pilot studies. \nDue to the number of requirements that had been \ngenerated, the representatives were divided into groups \nand each group was given a subset of requirements to \nreview and was asked to verify that each requirement \nwas unambiguous and testable. Subsequently, the \nstakeholders were asked to use the MoSCoW [4] \ntechnique from Dynamic Systems Development \nMethod to indicate that a requirement is a: \n\u0001 MUST: must have this \n\u0001 SHOULD: should have this if at all possible \n\u0001 COULD: could have this if it does not affect \nanything else \n\u0001 WOULD: won\u2019t have this time but would like \nto have in the future \nThe outcomes of the discussion in the subgroups \nwere then presented to the larger group, who finalised \nthe categorisation and prioritisation.  \nThe workshop was successful in enabling the \nrequirements to be discussed, clarified and prioritised. \nThe outcome was an agreed set of user requirements \nand benchmarks for both the Web portal of \nMyArtSpace and the Mobile phone service. \n\u0391n additional benefit of the workshop was the \nstakeholders\u2019 increased involvement, enthusiasm and \nownership of MyArtSpace through their participation \nin the design of the evaluation process.  \nEvaluation activities were subsequently planned to \ntest the identified user and educational requirements. \nThe user requirements were tested in two stages: \nthrough heuristic evaluations that were dispersed \nthroughout the system design phase, and through on-\nsite user observations that took place during pilot \ndeployment. The educational requirements were tested \nduring pilot deployment. \n \n4: Evaluation of of educational and user \nrequirements during  the design phase  \nA series of evaluations focusing on usability were \ncarried out during the system design phase. Formative \nevaluations were carried out on paper based prototypes \nof both components of the system (mobile phone \nservice interface and web portal). \nThe main method utilized was Heuristic Evaluation, \na \u2018discount usability\u2019 method developed by Nielsen [5] \nand widely used in usability evaluations of websites \nand interactive software. The method is particularly \neffective in finding and prioritising specific usability \nproblems [6]. It employs a group of evaluators (three to \nfive is recommended) with expertise in human-\ncomputer interaction. Each evaluator separately follows \na scenario to interact with the system while referring to \na set of specified usability principles (the \u2018heuristics\u2019). \nSubsequently, with the assistance of a recorder, the \nevaluator produces a written log of incidents where the \nsystem violates the heuristics. Together with the \nrecorder, the evaluator allocates a severity rating to \neach of these usability problems. The outcome is a \nreport listing the main usability problems indicating, \nfor each, its context within a scenario of use and its \nseverity. \nThe heuristic evaluations of the paper based \nprototypes highlighted important usability issues on \nboth the mobile phone service interface and the web \nportal for teachers, students and museum staff. For \nexample, problems with the main menu of the mobile \nphone interface were identified (the names of the menu \nitems are unclear). These usability issues, especially the \nones with high severity ratings, were rectified in \nsubsequent versions of the system components, \nensuring that they do not propagate into the fully \ndeveloped MyArtSpace service. This is one of the \nbenefits of adopting a Lifecycle approach to \nevaluation; problems are identified at an early stage \nwhen they can be easily corrected, whereas changing a \nproduct after deployment can be costly and not always \npossible. \n \n5: Evaluation of educational and user \nrequirements during pilot deployment \nTwo detailed pilot studies were conducted, one at \nthe Urbis museum in Manchester, UK, in November \n2005 with Key Stage 2 students; and one at the D-Day \nmuseum in Portsmouth, UK, in January 2006 with Key \nStage 3 students. The studies were designed in two \nphases to enable further refinement of the evaluation \nmethods and instruments. \nAs described in the introduction, the learning \nexperience with MyArtSpace includes three stages: the \nfirst stage (preparation) takes place in the classroom, \nwhere with the optional aid of the web portal the \nteacher prepares the class for the museum visit; the \nsecond stage (museum visit) takes place at the museum, \nwhere the students explore the exhibits and use the \nmobile phones to collect museum items and to create \ntheir own content (photos, audio notes, text notes); the \nthird stage (post museum visit) takes place back in the \nclassroom, where the students use the web portal to \nedit, present and share their personal galleries. \nEvaluation activities were designed for each stage and \nincluded: \n \n5.1:Preparation  \nPre 1st School Lesson: a telephone interview with \nthe teacher before the preparation lesson focused on the \nlearning outcomes against which the teacher would \njudge the success of the experience. The aim of the \ninterview was also to find out how the teacher planned \nto run the preparation, museum visit, and post-visit \nactivities, as well as to make all admin arrangements \n(including permissions to carry out evaluation \nactivities). \n1st School Lesson: observations of the teacher and \nthe students during the first school lesson focused on \nfinding out how both teacher and students work around \nthe MyArtSpace portal, whether they have any \ndifficulties in understanding and using it, how the \nwhole service is introduced by the teacher and how the \nlearning activities to follow are introduced. \nPost 1st School Lesson: an interview with the \nteacher and two focus groups with students focused on \ntheir impressions from the preparation lesson: did it \ndiffer to other museum visit preparations and how? \nHow did the preparation lesson shape their \nexpectations for the museum visit? Did they have any \nparticular problems in using the web portal for \nintroduction purposes? \n \n5.2: Museum visit \nPre museum visit: a structured interview with \nmuseum staff focused on their expectations from the \nintroduction of MyArtSpace, the identification of \noperating costs generated by it, and also the \nidentification of added value for the visitor experience. \nMuseum visit:  observations of teachers, students \nand participating museum staff focused on how the \nservice is used in practice and how the teachers and \nmuseum staff assist, direct and facilitate the student \nexperience in relation to the use of the mobile phone \nservice. Also usability problems were identified and \nnoted. \nPost museum visit: structured interviews with \nmuseum staff focused on their perceptions and opinions \nabout the museum adopting MyArtSpace. Interviews \nwith teachers focused on their impressions about \nMyArtSpace-enabled school visits to museums and \nhow it enhances\/hinders the learning process, and also \nto highlight problems experienced during the visit. \nFinally, focus groups with students sought to find out \ntheir impressions from using the MyArtSpace mobile \nphone service, whether and how it enhanced their visit, \nand what problems they had in using it. \n \n5.3: Post Museum Visit  \n2nd School Lesson:  observations of the teacher and \nstudents during the second school lesson that followed \nthe museum visit, focused on how they work with the \nMyArtSpace portal.  \nPost 2nd School Lesson: a structured interview with \nthe teachers and focus groups with the students focused \non how the lesson differed to other post museum visit \nlessons, whether they had any problems is using the \nMyArtSpace portal, what advantages\/disadvantages \nthey perceived in using it, and whether their \nexpectations for the MyArtSpace experience were \nfulfilled, what were their general impressions, and \nwhether they would use it again. The students in \nparticular were asked whether they thought the service \nwas fun to use, whether they thought they learned more \nthan during traditional museum visits, and whether they \nplanned to share their personal galleries with friends \nand family. \n \n6: Discussion \nThe first pilot study at the Urbis museum \nhighlighted several important issues, both in terms of \nsystem functionality and performance and in terms of \nthe way the system is integrated in the classroom. The \nsecond pilot study took place two months later, \nallowing time for the evaluation results to be \ncommunicated to the development team who in turn \nrevised the system accordingly. This trial verified that \nthe majority of the performance problems that occurred \nin the first trial were resolved, allowing the evaluation \nto identify more detailed and specific usability \nproblems and to further clarify how best to integrate the \nservice with school practices. \nThe severe system performance problems identified \nduring the first full-scale trial could not have been \neasily identified with small numbers of users, e.g. \nduring internal testing. Challenging as it may be to \nbring a design to a working level enough to support \nrealistic trials while remaining flexible enough to be \nable to accommodate changes, at the same time it is \nnecessary if performance is to be tested alongside \nfunctionality. \nThe first pilot study highlighted that the students \nwere very keen on using the phones to take \nphotographs, without necessarily entering a description \nof the object being photographed and explaining their \nreason for collecting. They did not appreciate that the \nnotes made during the collection phase in the museum \nwould later assist them in creating their MyArtSpace \nweb gallery from their collected items. This problem \ncould be resolved with additional training, to make \nstudents aware of the importance of carefully selecting \nthe objects to collect and of recording their responses \nto them; it also highlights the need for students to \nrealise not only what the technology can do, but also to \nappreciate how this can be educationally useful and \nrelevant to them. \nExtended use of the photo function was also made \nby students in the second study. The learning task in \nthe second study asked the students to explore the \nmuseum and collect objects while trying to form a view \nbased on the contents of the museum (whether D-Day \nwas a triumph or a disaster, as described in the \nintroduction). Since the students had not decided on a \nviewpoint in advance, they tended to collect objects \nirrespectively of which view they supported in the end. \nThis also contributed towards a vast collection of \nobjects, which was later hard to manage, manipulate \nand deconstruct. This observation draws attention to \nthe fact that care is needed not only in designing the \ntechnology, but also in designing the learning task that \nmakes use of the technology. Our recommendation was \nthat teachers should be allowed to customise \nMyArtSpace by adding content specific to their lesson \nplans. \nOur evaluations of the service have collected \npositive feedback from students, teachers, Local \nEducation Authority representatives and museum \neducators. \n\u201cThe day was of tremendous benefit to the \npupils and their history studies. The mobile \nphones were easy to use and the children were \nquickly off exploring the museum and making \ntheir own collections. I have not seen pupils \nso engaged or enthusiastic on a museum visit \nbefore.\u201d (Teacher, D-Day museum) \nThe way the \u2018collection\u2019 of museum items takes place \nencourages students to stop and think about each \nexhibit: what is the exhibit about, and how does it \nrelate to their learning task?  \n\u201cMade me look at artwork more ... Most people \nthink going to galleries is boring, but when you put \nideas on a web site and use the phones it's much \nmore fun.\u201d (Student, The Study Gallery) \n \n \n \n7: Conclusions \nThe Lifecycle Evaluation Approach placed the \nfocus on evaluation from the very start of the project. \nStakeholders were involved throughout, making the \nevaluation \u2018everyone\u2019s business\u2019 and ensuring that \nfindings feed into the design and development process. \nThe early identification of problems and issues during \ncarefully spaced evaluation activities enabled them to \nbe resolved prior to further trials and prior to the \nsystem being widely deployed.  \nMyArtSpace is a service that makes use of different \ntechnologies (mobile phones and the Web) to deliver a \nlearning experience that traverses the museum and the \nclassroom. It was therefore essential that the evaluation \nof the service did not stop at the evaluations of its \nindividual components; rather, it had to go beyond the \ntechnology to look at the learning experience as a \nwhole. The Lifecycle Evaluation Approach has made \nthis possible through its focus on both the usability and \nthe pedagogy of MyArtSpace, which enabled a full \npicture of the use of a new educational technology to \nbe understood, assessed and improved.  \n \n8: Acknowledgements \nWe would like to thank all the students and teachers \nwho enthusiastically took part in the evaluations and \nshowed us the potential of MyArtSpace. We would also \nlike to thank all those who participated in the user \nconsultation workshops, giving up their time to inform \nthe evaluations of the service.  \n \n9: References \n[1] Mulholland, P., Collins, T. & Zdrahal, Z.
