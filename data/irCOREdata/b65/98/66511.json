A two-dimensional smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code is used to simulate a superoutburst in a binary with the param-\neters of the SU UMa system Z Chamaeleontis. The simulated light curves shows all\nthe features observed in such systems. Analysis of the mass flux through the disc and\nthe growth rate of the superhumps and disc eccentricity show that the superoutburst-\nsuperhump phenomenon is a direct result of tidal instability. No enhanced mass trans-\nfer from the secondary is required to initiate or sustain these phenomena. Comparisons\nof superoutbursts with normal outbursts are made and we show that the model can\nbe reconciled with the behavior of U Geminorum type dwarf novae, which show no\nsuperoutbursts.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs - instabilities - binaries:close - novae, cata-\nclysmic variables- methods:numerical.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nSU Ursae Majoris systems are a class of cataclysmic variable\nwhich lie below the period gap (they have Porb < 2.1 hours)\nand which differ in their outburst behaviour from dwarf no-\nvae in two distinct ways : in addition to the normal outbursts\ndisplayed by dwarf novae which last two to three days, SU\nUMa systems undergo longer superoutbursts. These show\na plateau of brightness extending the outburst to ten days\nor more. Also, during a superoutburst, the light curve of\nan SU UMa reveals superhumps - a superimposed variation\nin brightness with a period a few percent longer than the\norbital period of the system. It has been suggested that nor-\nmal and superoutbursts do not coexist independently of each\nother, with a superoutburst being initiated by a normal out-\nburst. There is evidence for a relaxation time of \u223c 170 days\nin VW Hyi (van der Woerd and van Paradijs 1987), with all\nnormal outbursts triggering a superoutburst if they occur\n170 days or longer after the previous superoutburst.\n1.1 Outburst mechanisms\nHistorically, two models have been proposed to explain\ndwarf nova outbursts : a varying mass transfer rate from\nthe secondary due to its envelope being dynamically unsta-\nble (Bath 1973), or a varying viscosity in the accretion disc\nbetween quiescent and outburst states (Hoshi 1979). It is the\ndisc instability model that has prevailed as the accepted ex-\nplanation, offering better compatability with modern obser-\nvations and theory. An excellent review is given by Cannizzo\n(1993). We have recently used a smoothed particle hydrody-\nnamics (SPH) model to simulate a wide range of dwarf nova\noutburst characteristics (Truss et al., 2000).\nA complete theory of superoutbursts has been much\nmore elusive. Several models have been presented, however\nfew explain all the necessary properties, in particular the\nsuperhumps which appear without fail in every superout-\nburst. Models involving mass-transfer instabilities (Osaki\n1985), disc instabilities (Osaki 1989) and both (Duschl and\nLivio 1989) all explain some properties of a superoutburst. A\nbrief summary of these can be found in Warner (1995). Sim-\nulations by Whitehurst (1988) showed that discs in binaries\nwith mass ratios q <\u223c 1\/4\u22121\/3 could become tidally unstable.\nUnlike stable discs which had a shape that was fixed in the\nbinary frame, these unstable discs were significantly eccen-\ntric. In the inertial frame this eccentricity executed a slow\nprograde precession. Thus in the binary frame the disc pre-\ncessed retrogradely. Whitehurst found that the tidal stresses\non the precessing disc gave rise to a periodically varying light\ncurve that neatly explained superhumps. The disc instabil-\nity was explained in detail by Lubow (1991a) in terms of\nan (eccentric inner) Lindblad resonance that occurs where\norbits in the disc are 3 : 1 resonant with the binary orbit.\nOnly discs in systems with mass ratios q < 1\/4 \u2212 1\/3 are\nlarge enough to reach the resonance. This theoretical result\nclosely matches the spread of cataclysmic variables that are\nobserved to have superhumps (Patterson, 1998).\nOsaki (1989) espoused a superoutburst model which\ncombined the thermal and tidal instabilities. His model re-\nlied on the the outer disc radius varying significantly over\nthe course of a superoutburst cycle. At the end of a super-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 M. R. Truss et al\noutburst, Osaki proposed that the disc radius was small so\nthat it could not access the 3 : 1 resonance. Hence when\nthe disc became thermally unstable, a normal dwarf nova\noutburst occurred. As a result of the outburst however, the\ndisc spread radially. With each successive normal outburst\nthe disc grew until it encountered the 3 : 1 resonance and be-\ncame tidally as well as thermally unstable. Osaki proposed\nbut could not conclusively show, that the tidal removal of\nangular momentum was much more efficient from an ec-\ncentric disc. Consequently, when the disc encountered the\nresonance it would dump a large fraction of its mass upon\nthe white dwarf. A prolonged \u201csuper\u201d outburst that left a\nmuch diminished disc resulted. Osaki\u2019s model could not be\ncarried too far as the efficiency with which tides removed\nangular momentum from the outer disc could not be deter-\nmined with certainty. Osaki, and other workers, were relying\nupon one dimensional numerical models for disc evolution in\nwhich the tidal forces had only been included approximately.\nIn this paper we report the results of a smoothed parti-\ncle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a cataclysmic vari-\nable binary with mass ratio q = M2\/M1 = 0.15, representa-\ntive of the SU UMa system Z Chamaeleontis. As the code\nis fully three dimensional (though for the purposes of this\npaper the third dimension has been suppressed), tidal forces\nare included exactly. Thus for the first time we are able to\nfollow the evolution of an accretion disc over the course of\na superoutburst.\n2 NUMERICAL METHOD\n2.1 The Model\nThe model and methods used in this work have already been\ndescribed in our recent paper (Truss et al., 2000), as applied\nto a system with the properties of SS Cygni (0.6). The SPH\ncode directly includes the tidal forces due to the secondary,\nand incorporates a simple model for the dwarf nova thermal\ninstability.\nThe key to our calculations lies in the implementation\nof a viscosity switch. If the local surface density exceeds a\ndefined value \u03a3max then that region is transformed to the\nhigh-viscosity outburst state on a time-scale appropriate to\nthe thermal time-scale. There is a corresponding second trig-\nger level, \u03a3min, which causes the viscosity to be switched\nback down to the quiescent level. In this way we can simulate\nthe limit-cycle behaviour of a dwarf nova with an isothermal\nsimulation. Viscosity switches are nothing new in themselves\nin disc simulations, but in the past they have used trigger\nlevels which are constant throughout the disc. This is an\nunrealistic situation. Cannizzo, Shafter and Wheeler (1988)\nhave calculated the format for the critcal values of surface\ndensity \u03a3 in a steady-state disc and found an almost lin-\near relationship with disc radius R (Cannizzo, Shafter and\nWheeler, 1988, equations 2.1 and 2.2). Therefore, we imple-\nment a linear \u03a3\u2212R relationship for the disc in steady-state.\nThere are, however, some important refinements that\nhave been made for this study which were not made previ-\nously. In Truss et al. (2000) we incorporated an azimuthally\nsmoothed trigger condition, in which the density condition\nwas only tested for annuli in the disc. This is unsatisfac-\ntory for work on a system with a more extreme mass ra-\ntio because the outer regions of the disc depart strongly\n0 5 10 15 20\nTime (days)\n30.20\n30.30\n30.40\n30.50\nVi\nsc\nou\ns d\niss\nipa\ntio\nn f\nro\nm \nou\nter\n di\nsc\nFigure 1. Viscous dissipation from disc radii R > 20Rwd. This is\nrepresentative of the observed visual lightcurve. The scale of the\ndissipation program units is logarithmic and t=0 represents the\nbeginning of the outburst.\nfrom azimuthal symmetry in response to the tidal resonance.\nWe therefore calculate our trigger condition absolutely lo-\ncally for every particle in the simulation. We also previ-\nously used an enhanced viscosity parameter (\u03b1 = 0.1 in\nquiescence and \u03b1 = 1.0 in outburst) to improve the run-\ntime of the code. The desire to examine the growth-rate\nof superhumps on the correct time-scale has motivated us\nto use more realistic viscosity parameters here at the ex-\npense of simulating many outburst cycles. We use \u03b1 = 0.01\nin quiescence and \u03b1 = 0.1 in outburst, typical of the val-\nues in a dwarf nova disc (see, Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)\nfor a discussion of this viscosity parameterisation). We use\nother physical parameters relevant to observations of Z Cha\n- Porb = 0.075 d, M\u02d92 = 2x10\n15gs\u22121 (both from Wood et\nal. 1986) and M1 = 0.84M\u2299 (Wade et al. 1988). The disc\nis built up from a mass stream and undergoes normal out-\nbursts during the build-up to steady state in exactly the\nsame way as our previous simulations (Truss et al. 2000).\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Light Curves\nWe present light curves through the entire superoutburst.\nThe curves are constructed by summing the viscous dissipa-\ntion in different regions of the disc. In this way we are able\nto compare the results with observed lightcurves in different\nwavebands. This approach differs slightly from our previous\nwork, in which we attempted to reconstruct several wave-\nbands by treating the disc as a black body. Since the ob-\nserved optical emission is expected to be dominated by the\ncooler outer regions of the disc and the extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV) emission is dominated by the very hot inner region,\nwe can gain a qualitative understanding of the behaviour\nof the disc with this simplified approach. A more quanti-\ntative analysis should be left to future work in which full\nthermodynamics is incorporated self-consistently. Figure 1\nshows the viscous dissipation from the outer parts of the\ndisc (R >\u223c 20 Rwd). The profile and duration of the outburst\nis in good agreement with V-band observations of SU UMa\nsystems. The initial rise to outburst is fairly rapid, lasting\nfor two days, and is followed by the characteristic super-\noutburst plateau. Superhumps begin to appear prominently\nat t = 8 days.

Mass accretion rate onto the primary.\nulation is slower than observations have suggested - they\npersist (albeit with decreasing amplitude) during and just\nafter the decline from supermaximum. Buat-Me\u00b4nard et al.\n(2000) included the effects of stream-impact heating in a\none-dimensional model, and showed that this causes the\nfunctional form of the critical surface density to rapidly de-\ncrease at the disc edge. We believe that this would cause the\nouter disc to drain faster than in our simulation and drive\nthe edge away from the resonance more quickly, suppressing\nthe superhumps sooner. The decay from supermaximum is\nslower than the rise, lasting for 5 days. The total duration\nof the simulated superoutburst is around 18 days. Recent\nEUVE observations of OY Carinae, which has a similar mass\nratio to Z Cha, have shown that in addition to the expected\ndelay between the optical and EUV rise, the EUV emis-\nsion shows a rebrightening during superoutburst which is\nnot seen in the V-band (Mauche et al., 2000). We are able\nto look for this effect in the simulation by consideration of\nthe viscous dissipation coming from the hot, inner part of\nthe disc (R <\u223c 10 Rwd), which is shown in Fig. 2 and the\naccretion rate onto the white dwarf (a good measure of the\nX-Ray lightcurve - Fig. 3). The rebrightening can clearly be\nseen in both figures, and is caused by the arrival of addi-\ntional material from the outer disc which has been tidally\nforced into the high state.\n3.2 Disc Response\nIt is particularly instructive to construct a visualisation of\nthe disc at various times through the superoutburst cycle.\nFigure 4 shows dissipation maps of the disc in four states.\nThe hot-spot and spiral structure of the disc are clearly vis-\nFigure 5. Surface density evolution of the disc.The plots corre-\nspond to times t=5.0 days (solid line),t=10.3 days (dot-dashed\nline) and t=18.1 days (stars). The straight lines are the critical\nsurface density conditions \u03a3max and \u03a3min from the S-curve disc\ninstability model. a is the binary separation\nible. In quiescence, the disc is not in contact with the 3:1\nresonance; consequently it is circular. The innermost part of\nthe disc remains in the high state. This is in agreement with\nour previous work on SS Cygni. The outburst progresses just\nas for a normal outburst, but during this time the disc radius\nincreases and the edge of the disc encounters the resonance.\nWe stress that this resonance is not available to systems with\nless extreme mass ratios. The disc rapidly becomes eccen-\ntric and virtually the entire disc is transformed to the high\nviscosity outburst state. It is interesting to note the bright-\nness of the hot-spot in the lower-left hand panel of fig. 4.\nDuring supermaximum, we find that the brightness of the\nhotspot varies according to the orientation of the eccentric\ndisc. This is not due to a varying mass transfer rate from\nthe secondary - this remains constant at all times during\nthe simulation - it is purely a result of the geometry of the\nstream impact region. The existence of such an effect in the\nnova-like V348 Pup has been reported by Rolfe et al. (2000).\nFigure 5 shows the evolution of surface density with disc ra-\ndius. Initially, the inner regions (R <\u223c0.25a) go into outburst\n(solid line), but it should be noted that the large reservoir of\nmass at larger radii is very close to the upper critical thresh-\nold. Consequently, it is only a short time before nearly the\nwhole disc is in outburst, and at supermaximum the large\nreservoir of mass is seen to move to smaller radii (diamonds).\nAt the end of the superoutburst, a large fraction of the disc\nhas been accreted (stars); \u223c 60%, compared with \u223c 5\u221210%\nfor a normal outburst.\n3.3 Modal Analysis and Superhumps\nWe compare the response of the disc to the tidal field of\nthe secondary star with the analysis of Lubow (1991a). The\ntidal potential can be decomposed into a set of functions\n\u03c6(r, \u03b8, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nm=0\n\u03c6m(r)cos[m(\u03b8 \u2212 \u2126orbt)], (1)\nwhere each mode m generates a sinusoidal response in the\ndisc with argument (k\u03b8 \u2212 l\u2126orbt). The (k,l) = (1,0) mode\nrepresents the disc eccentricity, which grows exponentially\nat a rate\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 M. R. Truss et al\nFigure 4.

Fig. 7 shows a 15 hour portion of the lightcurve from\nthe same region of the disc as defined in fig. 1. We also find\na strong superhump signal produced from the inner part of\nthe disc. This emission results from the spiral shock wave\nreaching all the way down into this region, and the effect\ncan be seen with striking clarity in the map of the disc in\nfig. 8.\n4 DISCUSSION\nWe have performed the first two-dimensional simulation of a\ndwarf nova superoutburst. The method includes the full tidal\npotential of the binary and reproduces the observed charac-\nteristics of a superoutburst with no need for enhanced mass\ntransfer from the secondary star. This leads us to conclude\nthat the superoutburst-superhump phenomenon is purely a\nresult of the tidal instability working in tandem with the\nthermal disc instability. Superoutbursts are therefore not\nseen in systems with less extreme mass ratios (q>\u223c0.25) be-\ncause the tidal resonance is not available to them.\nWe feel that there is much confusion in the literature\nregarding the terminology of \u2019wide\u2019 and \u2019narrow\u2019, \u2019inside-\nout\u2019 and \u2019outside-in\u2019 outbursts. This work coupled with our\nprevious study of normal outbursts suggests the following :\n1. An outburst may be initiated at any point in the disc\nand in general the resultant heating wave will travel in both\ndirections.\n2. All types of dwarf nova can exhibit both wide and nar-\nrow outbursts. The physical distinction between the two is\nsimply whether the heating wave propagates to the large\nreservoir of mass stored in the outer parts of the disc or not.\n3. The superoutburst\/superhump phenomenon is a result\nof the presence of the tidal instability, in addition to the\nthermal instability. The tidal instability is responsible for\nsuperhumps, and the duration of a superoutburst is primar-\nily determined by the hot region of the disc arising from the\nthermal instability. However, the duration will be length-\nened by the enhanced mass accretion arising from the tidally\nheated gas, which produces the EUV rebrightening discussed\nin section 3.1.\nLong-term observations of dwarf novae are still needed\nacross a variety of wavebands in order to improve our un-\nderstanding of these objects. EUV and X-Ray observations\nwill reveal much about the physics of the boundary layer\nbetween the disc and the surface of the white dwarf, while\neclipse mapping and do\u00a8ppler tomography should probe the\nstructure of the disc and the ro\u02c6le of the spiral waves. We also\npoint out that observations of the growth rate of superhumps\ncan be used to gain estimates for mass ratio, through referral\nto Lubow\u2019s modal analysis that we have reprised here.\nIt is very important to concentrate on two and three di-\nmensional simulations in the future, as the full tidal field is\ninherent in these models. The next step should be to perform\na 3D calculation which includes fully self-consistent thermo-\ndynamics. One can envisage a hybrid of a 2D isothermal\ncode such as this one with a traditional 1D thermodynam-\nics code. This is a mammoth task in terms of computational\nrequirements, but all the components of such a model al-\nready exist.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nResearch in theoretical astrophysics at Leicester is sup-\nported by a PPARC rolling grant.
