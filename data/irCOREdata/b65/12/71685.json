This is exemplified by a tentative \napplication of the framework to the case of Amsterdam in order to better understand its recent \ndecline in competitiveness as a European financial centre. \n \n1. Introduction \nThe turn of the twenty-first century saw the re-emergence of public and academic debates about \nthe centrality of London as Europe\u2019s pre-eminent international financial centre (IFC) and the \nwider reconfiguration of European financial geographies (Bindemann 1999; Seifert et al. 2000; \nHarrschar-Ehrnborg 2002). This was sparked by the EU agenda to develop a Europe-wide \nfinancial market, the introduction of the Euro currency, and the first attempts to create a Pan-\nEuropean exchange. With the highly visible, but failed, initial merger talks between the Frankfurt-\nbased Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in the late 1990s (Beaverstock et \nal. 2001; Faulconbridge 2004), and the creation of Euronext (the first cross-border exchange in \nEurope with subsidiaries in Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris in 2000), the scene was set for \nconsolidation in Europe\u2019s fragmented and diversified exchange landscape (McCreevy 2005; \n 3 \nFESE 2006). Renewed bids for the LSE by both its German competitor and by Euronext in 2005 \n(Bundeskartellamt 2005; Competition Commission 2005), as well as the recent entrance by the \nNYSE and Nasdaq in the European scrimmage, point to a future of intercontinental alliances and \neven transcontinental exchanges. \nWhile media speculation about the local impact of cross-border stock exchange mergers \nflares up periodically, the empirical evidence on the interrelationship between the restructuring of \nexchanges and its impact on the wider urban setting in which these exchanges are located is both \nscarce and indeterminate. Historically stock exchanges have been closely connected to the \ndevelopment of national and even international financial centres (Thrift 1994; Michie 1999), but \nthese linkages seem to have become weaker with the increased virtualization of stock exchanges \nin recent years (Lo and Grote 2003). However, there is much that remains to be done in current \nresearch into these linkages, both conceptually and empirically. In this context, the paper \nexplores the implications of the continually fluxing stock exchange landscape for financial centre \ndevelopment by focusing on the changing levels of trade in different financial products in \nAmsterdam pre and post merger with the Brussels and Paris (and latterly Lisbon) exchanges in \nthe guise of the Euronext consortium. As such, the paper\u2019s aim is primarily explorative. It seeks \nto assess the explanatory power of a product and knowledge-based approach to the financial \nlandscape by using Amsterdam as a test case. \nThe paper is divided into three parts. First, the discussion focuses upon the spatial \nstickiness of international finance and identifies the forces that continue to exert considerable \ninfluence on the geographical organization of the European financial landscape. It is suggested \nthat it is the type of financial product developed and traded in each centre that matters most in \nthe spatial (re)configuration of Europe\u2019s financial centres. More specifically, the paper argues that \nthe nature of the mix of complementary financial products determines the strength of a financial \ncentre and that this in turn is influenced by the activities of local epistemic communities, national \nregulation and, embedded within this context, stock exchange reconfiguration. Second, drawing \nupon the case of Amsterdam, the paper considers the extent to which the analytical framework \nproposed allows us to make sense of the city\u2019s recent decline as a European financial centre. The \n 4 \nrelationship between different financial products is examined and the effect of the emergence of \nthe Euronext consortium is explored with some preliminary data on the Amsterdam financial \ncentre. The paper concludes with a tentative discussion of the relation between stock exchange \nreorganization and the informational content of products traded in a specific financial centre. \n \n2. The Spatial Stickiness of International Finance \nThe organizational structure of the European financial system, and in particular the constitution \nof the stock exchange and financial market landscape, has been explored from various \nperspectives. For example, Michie (1992; 1999) acknowledges the pivotal role of the Lloyds \nInsurance market, and especially its magnetic qualities for those seeking mercantile insurance, in \nthe development of London as an international financial centre during the British Empire. \nSimilarly, Thrift (1994) and Porteous (1999) have emphasized the importance of regulation and \nadministrative procedures in order to explain the physical co-location of financial firms that \nspecialize in equity-related activities. More recently, attention has turned to the effects of the \nvirtualization of stock exchanges on existing financial geographies. Drawing on the well \nrehearsed \u2018death of distance\u2019 (Cairncross 1997) and \u2018end of geography\u2019 (O\u2019Brien 1992) theses, the \nevolution of stock exchanges away from \u2018open outcry\u2019 pits towards \u2018screen-based\u2019 trading has \nbeen examined. This has lead to claims that the traditional anchoring devices that fix activities in \nIFCs have been weakened and that as a result financial centres might gradually disappear in the \nvortex of dispersal that is technologically-driven globalization (Engelen 2007). At the same time, \nfascinating stories have been told about the changes in the \u2018social construction\u2019 of markets, as \nphysically embodied encounters between traders in the pit are replaced by hoards of (still \npredominantly) men staring intently at screens. Of course, even in a virtualized world markets are \nbeing \u2018produced\u2019 and \u2018reproduced\u2019 by the performative effects of practices, ideas and techniques \nof traders embedded in social networks (Knorr Cetina and Preda 2005; MacKenzie and Millo \n2003; Zaloom 2003) but it seems this might increasingly have less spatial fixity than before with \nfinancial knowledges moving across new spatial topologies (Allen 2002; Amin and Cohendet \n2004). \n 5 \nAll of these bodies of literature touch upon issues that are important for understanding \nchanging financial geographies. However, they fail to add up to a consistent analytical framework \nthat allows us to identify the full gamut of relevant variables. While regulation clearly matters for \nthe distribution of financial activities over space, it is evident that the regulatory landscape has \nradically changed since the early 1990s. Responding to the intensifying transnationalization of \nfinancial activities, regulation at the national level has increasingly been liberalized while a \ngrowing number of responsibilities and prerogatives have been shifted to transnational agents \nlike the EU, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions (IOSCO) and other, even more obscure agents (L\u00fctz 2002; Braithwaite \nand Drahos 2000). As such, national-level regulation has become less a constraint and more a \nsource of competitive (dis)advantage. \nThe \u2018end of geography\u2019-literature, on the other hand, while forcefully arguing for an \nincreased awareness of the impact of ICT on international finance, clearly seems to overstate its \nmain insights in what is often unmitigated technological determinism. The continuing relevance \nof place and co-location, demonstrated by, for example, the recent successes of New York\u2019s \nSouth Manhattan and, especially, the City of London (see The Economist 2006), doubtless flies \nin the face of all radical globalization claims. Technological possibilities of virtualization are \nclearly counteracted by more traditional advantages of co-location. It remains to be seen, \nhowever, whether these advantages are indeed of the traditional kind or have changed their \nnature under the impact of regulatory and technological change. \nThe very productive \u2018social studies of finance\u2019 perspective, finally, presents a growing \namount of evidence that even virtual financial markets have a social underpinning, which, \nmoreover, can only be fruitfully investigated by ethnographic means. As such, this literature both \nemphasizes the importance of going beyond the proximity clich\u00e9s that have for so long been the \nstock-in-trade of economic geographers and of the need for economic geographers to become \nmore like cultural anthropologists (see also Clark 2005a). However, because of its descendance \nfrom social studies of science, this literature has a tendency towards meta-theorizing as a result of \nwhich scholars can lose sight of the ultimate explanatory role of the social sciences. \n 6 \nWhile taking on board, as much as possible, the insights of these three bodies of \nliterature, we take as our starting point a corpus of literature that is more down-to-earth in the \nsense that it takes empirical developments as an invitation for conceptual and theoretical renewal \nrather than the other way round. \n \n2.1 Geographies of Virtual and Amalgamated Stock Exchanges \nThe virtualization of stock exchanges was one of the underlying drivers behind the \u2018death of \ndistance\u2019 and \u2018end of geography\u2019 exaggerations, principally because of the technical ability it \nprovided to trade from a location physically remote from the site of an exchange. However, as \nMartin observed, this \u201cmay well have annihilated space\u2026 but it has by no means undermined the \nsignificance of location, of place\u2026 [N]ew technologies and globalization are not obliterating the \nlandscapes of money, but reconfiguring them in significant ways\u201d (1999, 15-16, emphasis in \noriginal). The most important outcome of such reconfigurations was the emergence of what has \nbecome known as a \u2018new\u2019 international financial system, a system where money and financial \nproducts flow more freely (but not totally unimpeded) across capitalist networks (Thrift and \nLeyshon 1988; Clark and Wojzcik 2006). Nevertheless, IFCs have continued to act as \u2018nodes\u2019 \nwithin a \u2018neo-marshallian\u2019 system (Amin and Thrift 1992), exerting a form of \u2018stickiness\u2019 that, to \nfollow Clark\u2019s (2005b) analogy, means that \u2018money flows like mercury\u2019, rather than water, with \ngeographically uneven pools of financial activity remaining. This, then, is the most well-rehearsed \nargument about the continued importance of place to financial activities, with three strands of \ndiscussion, emphasising different explanatory variables, continuing to dominate explanations of \nthe importance of \u2018being there\u2019. \n \n\u2022 The \u2018urbanization\u2019 logic: pivotal to the international financial system are the large global financial \ninstitutions that act as the principal traders and prime brokers for third parties. For example, \nthe UK\u2019s Competition Commission (2005) noted that the ten largest financial institutions are \nresponsible for half of all European equity trading. The same is true for global foreign \nexchange trade. While uniquely transparent and globalized, trade is highly dominated by the \n 7 \nlargest investment banks and is deeply embedded in the organizational entrails of these firms, \nallowing for highly valuable trade between anonymous \u2018others\u2019 who share the birthmarks of \nthe organizations of which they are part (Clark and Thrift 2005). These firms also have \nintense relationships with a range of other advanced producer services (in particular \naccountants, lawyers and financial information providers) that act as essential intermediaries \nin financial transactions. Consequently, leading IFCs such as London and New York, where \nthese financial conglomerates have their (head) offices \u2013 primarily for historical reasons \u2013, \ncontinue to remain hubs of financial activities because of their agglomerations of financial \ninstitutions and supporting producer services and the benefits brought to them in terms of \nboth the timeliness of services and ability to convey tacit advice and consolidate important \ninter-firm relationships (Beaverstock et al. 2000; Faulconbridge 2007; Sassen 2000; Thrift \n1987). However, while urban concentration was crucial for financial liquidity before \nvirtualization, the advantages of concentration seem to have shifted in today\u2019s screen-based \nenvironment. Instead, the presence of a sufficient number of knowledgeable clients and \nsuppliers with which to conduct ever more complex and sophisticated bespoke trades seems \nimportant today, something which leads us to our second point. \n \n\u2022 Localization advantages: finance has always been an industry where the knowledge of traders \nhas had a direct influence on profitability, something that is even further amplified by the \nincreased complexity of contemporary financial products (Thrift 1994; Tickell 2000). The \nclustering of financial institutions within IFCs leads to what has been described as \n\u2018information spillovers\u2019 (Porteous 1999) or \u2018buzz\u2019 (Storper and Venables 2004). This is the \nprocess of knowledge creation and dispersion that is facilitated by the relatively tight spatial \nmatrix within which financial institutions locate themselves in leading IFCs (e.g. The City and \nCanary Wharf in London, South Manhattan in New York, \u2018das Bankenviertel\u2019 in Frankfurt), \nand the dense social interactions between traders within these matrices (Thrift 1994; \nCorporation of London 2003). Being embedded within such spaces of knowledge production \nand dispersion appears to be essential for conducting profitable trades. As studies in the \n 8 \nsociology of finance have shown (Abolafia 2004; Beunza and Stark 2004; Zaloom 2003), \ndecision making and actions in financial markets cannot be disassociated from the \ninteractions within the trading room, and more widely within the local financial community. \nHowever, it is increasingly debated whether that actually requires physical proximity and \nwhether other forms of proximity \u2014 social, cultural, organizational \u2014 do not suffice (Allen \n2002; Amin and Cohendet 2004; Beaverstock 2006; Faulconbridge 2006; Grote et al. 2002). \nThe implications of this, whilst contested (Clark et al. 2006; Gertler 2003), are potentially \nsignificant and may force a reconceptualization of the nature of localization advantages. \n \n\u2022 Institutional and regulatory advantage: whilst some have suggested this is of declining influence \n(e.g. Budd 1999), it is argued here that the regulatory institutions influencing IFCs are as \npertinent as ever (see also Clark 2002; Corporation of London 2003). Without wanting to \nbecome entangled in debates about the rolling back or otherwise of the nation state, it seems \nthat regulatory influences continue to provide advantages to some centres and disadvantages \nto others. The example of the Bund-future market, primarily based on German federal \nbonds, but initially traded and regulated in London because of the prevention of derivatives \ntrading in Germany until 1990, illustrates such an argument (Laulajainen 2001). After re-\nregulation the Bund-future market moved to Frankfurt because of the advantages of the \nGerman electronic trading system, especially its cost-efficiency. However, this resulted in an \ninteresting form of spatial organization and specialization. The exchange was based and \nregulated in Germany, but traders continued to be almost exclusively located in London as \nthe \u2018epistemic knowledge community\u2019 exists there and the \u2018localization\u2019 advantages described \nabove \u2018fix\u2019 traders in the City (Lo and Grote 2003). Other examples are the successes of \nDublin and Luxembourg to attract an increasing number of hedge funds and other money \nmanagers by lax establishment rules and competitive fiscal systems (Hardie and MacKenzie \n2006). Even more topical are the worries voiced by the British financial establishment about \na future merger of the LSE with Nasdaq, currently one of its largest shareholders, over the \npossibility that the LSE would come to fall under the over restrictive regulation of the SEC \n 9 \n(Financial Times 2006a). Similarly, the growing share of international IPO\u2019s going to \nLondon\u2019s LSE and AIM instead of New York\u2019s NYSE is largely the effect of prohibitive \ncorporate governance regulation under the US Sarbanes-Oxley legislation (The Economist \n2006). Hence, it is fair to conclude that even in a neoliberal world, regulatory differences can \nstill play a role in explaining the differential distribution of financial activities over space. \n \nThe \u2018end of geography\u2019, then, is far from nigh in the European financial system. The introduction \nof Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the virtualization of trade are not \ngoing to wipe the historically pre-structured slate of finance clean. Hence, technological \nextrapolations are unable to explain the present nor do they allow an easy reading off of the \nfuture pattern of the geographically uneven \u2018pools\u2019 of financial activity from current distributions \nof capital. Similarly, the location and organizational form of stock exchanges are not proxies for \nmarket location and IFC construction (Clark 2005b). Consequently, it is increasingly important to \nground analyses of European (and global) financial geographies in a closer understanding of the \nwider contexts that create sticky and, at the same time, shifting geographies. To do this, we need \na conceptualization of finance that is not preloaded towards one of the three explanatory \nvariables mentioned above but is catholic enough to encompass all three of them. We surmise \nthat a focus on financial products, and the associated market conditions and knowledge \ncommunities that facilitate their development and trading, as suggested by Clark and O\u2019Connor \n(1997), is up to this task.  \nSince financial products are about prices, risks and (future) streams of income as well as \nthe external conditions impinging on these variables, they are pre-eminently about information. \nAs such, a focus on products and the information they contain clearly covers the epistemic \ncommunity dimension of the explanatory template. Moreover, since knowledge and information \ndiffer with regard to the extent in which they are in need of interpretation, a focus on the \ninformational content of different financial products allows us to determine the importance of \nphysical proximity to both clients and suppliers with regard to different financial transactions and \nhence to explain their spatial distribution.  \n 10 \nThe institutional dimension impinges on this in at least two ways. First, in determining \nthe size of the domestic financial industry and the depth of public financial markets. Since the \nliquidity of financial markets is institutionally determined, the quality and quantity of available \nfinancial products is too. If there is a large amount of domestic capital available for investment in \nequity and bond markets, as is generally the case in political economies with funded pension \nsystems, financial markets tend to be deeper and hence more transparent than is the case in \npolitical economies with pay-as-you-go pension systems (Verdier 2002; Clark 2003). Second, in \naffecting the extent to which financial regulation, corporate governance law and securities law do \nconform to what is increasingly seen as the international standard, namely British or American \nregulatory conventions. This latter, more direct dimension of institutional determination covers \neverything from the entrance criteria of public stock markets, to the accountancy rules \nconcerning the consolidation of pension assets and liabilities (V\u00e9ron et al. 2006), and the legal \nprotections provided to minority shareholders (La Porta et al. 1998; 1999). This influences the \nlocational decision-making of leading traders and investors. As such, a product perspective allows \nus to track shifts over time in the composition of the type of trade conducted in specific IFCs \nand relate these to stock exchange reconfigurations and changes in the underlying variables just \nmentioned.  \nNote, however, that while clearly implicating path dependent explanations of the current \ndistribution of finance over space, our conceptualization of institutional \u2018effects\u2019 is more about \nthe managed \u2018reproduction\u2019 (or, as is the case in Amsterdam: the failure to do so) of financial \nadvantages and disadvantages than about the \u2018origins\u2019 of these advantages and disadvantages. \nBoth are related, but different, and the two parts need to be kept distinct in order to avoid the \nfallacy of functionalism (explaining the genesis of a particular arrangement from its current \nfunction) or the a-historical terra nullius-assumption of much of neoclassical economics (see \nMahoney 2000). We emphatically do not want to suggest that the empirical field of finance is not \nhistorically pre-structured. Hence, the distribution of transparent products will not be random, as \nthe \u2018end of geography\u2019 thesis maintains, but will tend to \u2018flow\u2019 to historically determined pools of \ncapital and, in particular, those IFCs that reproduce themselves in an attractive manner in the \n 11 \ncontemporary era. The paper does not pretend to provide an historical explanation of the genesis \nof specific geographical pools of finance but takes the historically determined distribution of \ncapital over space as an empirical given.1 This historical substrate is, then, used as a starting point \nfor considering contemporary trends and informs analysis of the present day influences on the \ngeographical dynamics of finance. Before visiting the case of Amsterdam in order to exemplify \nthis argument, we first briefly summarize Clark and O\u2019Connor\u2019s framework and its usefulness in \nguiding this type of analysis. \n \n2.2 Geographies of \u2018Sticky\u2019 Financial Products \nAccording to Clark and O\u2019Connor (1997), the localization of trading in transparent financial \nproducts is primarily determined by price considerations and hence by \u2018economies of scale\u2019. \nKnowledge of the underlying entity (firm, commodity, real estate, infrastructure, etc) is \nunimportant, as the controlling variables determining the price of property rights are highly \nstandardized, instantly available and hardly in need of insider interpretations. Consequently, trade \nin these types of products, which consists mostly of simple buy\/sell transactions, can take place \nanywhere, with concentration normally occurring in centres such as London and New York \nbecause of the critical mass of traders present (and therefore the reduction in costs and a high \nlevel of liquidity offered). Trade in commodities, FX-trade as well as in \u2018blue chip\u2019 stocks of large \ninternationally renowned firms and guilt-edged bonds are obvious examples of financial products \nthat form the backbone of international financial trade and as such have increasingly become \nglobal assets that do no longer provide co-located traders with proximity advantages. Since these \ntypes of assets have increasingly become global assets, the information on which their prices are \ndependent does no longer serve as a criterion to distinguish insiders and outsiders.  \n \n[ Table 1. about here ] \n \n                                            \n1 See Wallerstein (1974), Braudel (1982), Harvey (1982) Arrighi (1996), and Cassis (2006) for \nhistorical accounts of the genesis of the unequal spatial distribution of capital over time.  \n 12 \nThe intermediate category consists of translucent products. These are variations on well known \nglobal products that use local mutations to create a geographically and temporarily unique \nproduct. As a result, the knowledge needed to trade in such products and the risk associated with \nthem is unclear to those outside the market, yet is not exclusively local in a strict sense. A small \ninvestment to gain insight into the product may allow it to be traded without physical presence in \nthe long term. Clark and O\u2019Connor (1997: 97) acknowledge that the translucent category often \nblurs with the transparent and opaque ones. As such, this intermediate category bridges the \ncompletely transparent and the completely opaque. While hard to identify and delineate clearly, it \nis our contention that within the contemporary financial landscape, those financial agents who \nare able to render transparent products (partially) opaque (e.g. hedge funds) and opaque products \npartially transparent (e.g. private equity funds) have become increasingly important for large \ninstitutional investors looking for (quasi)bespoke products that fit their highly idiosyncratic risk \nand return profiles, and have come to determine by and by the dynamism on which vital IFCs \nrely. Hence, if nothing else, localization advantages and regulation can ensure such competitive \nadvantage is gained. \nTrade in opaque financial products, by definition, takes place in close proximity to the \nactors who have a thorough knowledge of the underlying entity. There is a deep information \nasymmetry in the sense that traders have no way of fully understanding the variables controlling \nfluctuations in a product\u2019s price, something that can only be overcome by developing strong \nrelationships both with those who \u2018design\u2019 the product and those with experience of its trading. \nPrivate equity exemplifies this category, but so do the small and mid cap sections of public \nexchanges. Since changes in the underlying variables impinging on the price of the property titles \nlargely occur outside the radar screens of the international analysts, different means of access to \ncrucial information are needed in order to be a successful trader. Here proximity and access to \nrelevant epistemic communities becomes crucial. Outsiders lacking these avenues of access are \ndependent on local \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in order to be able to trade in these opaque financial categories. \nAt the same time, regulation determines whether such innovative products can be \naccommodated.  \n 13 \nAs table 1 highlights, one result of the differing informational content of each product \ntype is, according to Clark and O\u2019Connor\u2019s (1997) analytical framework, a product-specific spatial \ndistribution of financial activities over different IFCs, which neither conforms to the strong \u2018end \nof geography\u2019 claim nor to the \u2018neo-marshallian\u2019 world of Amin and Thrift (1992), in which \nagglomeration spillovers are strong enough to withstand the combined centripetal forces of \nmarket integration and technological change. Instead, the Clark and O\u2019Connor framework leads \none to expect increasing concentration of transparent trade in the largest, most well-equipped \nIFCs, while the trade in opaque products would remain located across a wider range of IFCs, \nincluding smaller centres such as Amsterdam. Less clear are the spatial expectations for the \nintermediate category of \u2018translucent\u2019 products since Clark and O\u2019Connor have largely treated \nthem as a residual category. Below we apply the Clark and O\u2019Connor framework to trace the fate \nof the Amsterdam IFC from the 1980s onward in order to identify the as yet undertheorized \ninter-linkages between the three product categories and the three-pronged influence of \nagglomeration, localization and regulation on processes of change over time. We argue that the \nchanging geography of financial products is a result of inter-relationships between all three \nproduct categories and that, in particular, transparent and opaque products are interlinked with \ntheir geographies being mutually dependent and not exclusive. \n \n3. Changing Financial Geographies: The Case of Amsterdam \n3.1 Sustainable Growth? \nAs a historical financial centre that once ruled the international financial world, Amsterdam has \nsucceeded in weathering many fateful shifts and turns (see Barbour 1976; Riley 1980; Schama \n1987; Neal 1990; Braudel 1982; Cassis 2006). During the 1980s, the Amsterdam financial \ncommunity was well positioned to jump the bandwagon of the financial boom that started with \nthe demise of \u2018embedded liberalism\u2019 in the mid-1970s (Ruggie 1982; Helleiner 1994). Compared \nto the 1960s and 1970s when annual turnover of trade in equities and bonds at the Amsterdam \nstock exchange ranged form EUR 4,5 billion to EUR 8,7 billion and EUR 1,2 billion to EUR 9,7 \nbillion respectively for shares and bonds, during the 1980s levels of EUR 83 billion were reached \n 14 \nfor shares and EUR 90 billion for bonds (CBS 2006a). Given this sharp increase in liquidity and \nhence volatility of the most transparent products traded in the Amsterdam IFC, it became \nincreasingly attractive to set up a formal trading floor for the trade in derivatives which until then \nhad largely been traded \u2018over the counter\u2019. The Amsterdam Option Exchange, established in \n1978, is a clear example of the adroitness of the Amsterdam economic elite in anticipating a \nnumber of organizational and technological innovations that were destined to radically change \nthe face of international finance by building upon an already existing epistemic community of \ncommodity traders in order to create a new equity option market. The Option Exchange was the \nfirst of its kind in Europe and attracted a large number of foreign financial firms during the \n1980s and 1990s to the Amsterdam IFC. At that time equity options were still relatively obscure \nand hence possessed opaque informational characteristics, forcing foreign firms to locate in the \nimmediate surroundings of the option exchange at the Rokin in the centre of Amsterdam. Whilst \nthe uniqueness and hence attractiveness of the Amsterdam IFC gradually wore off as the number \nof formal derivative exchanges increased and options gradually lost their \u2018opaqueness\u2019, the early \nestablishment of such a formal derivative exchange and the facilitation of this by suitable \nregulation, clearly indicates Amsterdam\u2019s role in the development and trade of the new breed of \n\u2018opaque\u2019 financial products that symbolized the \u2018new\u2019 international financial system (Tickell \n2000).  \nAnother innovation that saw Amsterdam at the forefront was the use of ICT to \nvirtualize the trading process, enhancing the accessibility of the Amsterdam exchanges by means \nof remote access ports. The Amsterdam stock exchange, which went virtual in 1994, was one of \nthe first worldwide to do so, as was the Amsterdam Options Exchange which followed in 2002. \nThese decisions must be seen in the light of increasing competition from more liquid financial \nmarkets such as the ones domiciled in Paris, Frankfurt and, especially, London, with the \nunderlying rationale that virtualization would bring higher trading efficiency, improve liquidity, \nand would thus enhance the attractiveness of the Amsterdam trading platform both for investors \nand for share issuing firms. Concerning the former, the two Amsterdam exchanges witnessed a \nrapidly increasing growth in turnover during the 1990s. Turnover at the Amsterdam option \n 15 \nexchange rose from a little over 10 million contracts traded per day in 1990 to well over 60 \nmillion contracts in 1999. The biggest boost to trading volume, however, came after the \nvirtualization of the exchange when the number of contracts traded daily rapidly reached the one \nbillion mark (Euronext.Liffe 2005). Turnover at the Amsterdam stock exchange too got a huge \nboost from virtualization. While the beginning of the 1990s saw average daily turnover reaching a \nlevel of EUR 66 billion, in 1994 it had increased to EUR 143 billion, before reaching an all time \nhigh of EUR 707 billion in 1997 (CBS 2006b). Also in terms of share issues, the 1990s saw a \nhuge increase. Starting from a low of EUR 326 million in 1988, it reached EUR 2,7 billion in \n1994, and since has gradually increased to EUR 18,9 billion in 1999 (DNB 2006), clearly \ndemonstrating the liquidity attracting effects of virtualization. \nA third, organizational, innovation within the world of stock exchanges was undertaken \nin 1996 when the Paris Bourse and the Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges announced that they \nwould integrate their (virtual) order books and would adopt the Parisian trading system in order \nto pool their respective liquidities, which were considered to be too small to withstand the \nincreasing centrifugal force of the London Stock Exchange. Euronext, as the product of the \nmerger was christened, is at the moment of writing still the only truly transnational stock \nexchange. While the value of average daily trading of the combined exchanges of Euronext in \n1990 added up to only $ 170 billion, turning them into the 8th largest exchange worldwide, \ncurrently Euronext is the 5th largest exchange in terms of average daily turnover (after, \nrespectively, the NYSE, Nasdaq, the LSE and the Tokyo exchanges), the 6th largest exchange in \nterms of market capitalization (after, respectively, the NYSE, Tokyo, Nasdaq, the LSE and the \nOsaka exchanges), and the 8th largest in terms of number of listed firms (after, respectively, the \nBombay, Toronto, Nasdaq, LSE, NYSE, Tokyo and Korean exchanges) (WFE 2006). This, \nagain, clearly demonstrates the importance of pooled liquidity for the operational success of an \nexchange organization in a context of financial market integration. \nDuring the 1990s, the anticipatory strategy of the Amsterdam financial community (since \n1992 officially represented by the Amsterdam Financial Centre Foundation) appeared to pay off \nin terms of number of firms, share of financial services in Amsterdam GDP and in total \n 16 \nturnover. The number of foreign banks in the Netherlands rose from 54 in 1990 to 79 in 1997, \nmore than three quarters of which were located in the Amsterdam city centre (NIBE-SVV, \nseveral years). A similar picture is shown in the field of stock and option trading. While the total \nnumber of officially registered Dutch stock traders declined gradually from 19 in 1990 to 12 in \n2000, this was more than offset by the rise of foreign traders, whose number rose from 8 in 1993 \nto 27 in 2002 (DNB 2002). This growth was reflected in the increasing share of the financial \nservices in Amsterdam GDP. While the Amsterdam economy increased between 1996 and 2002 \nby 25.7 per cent, financial services grew by a stunning 46 percent, the largest single annual share \nof which was booked in 1999 (22.6 per cent). Overall, total annual turnover of Amsterdam\u2019s \nfinancial service industry increased by a factor 16 between the early 1970s and the turn of the \ntwenty-first century, most of which occurred during the 1990s. Meanwhile Amsterdam\u2019s \neconomy overall merely grew by a factor five. At the turn of the millennium financial services \ngenerated approximately one fourth of the total economic product of Amsterdam compared with \nonly one-fifth in the early 1970s (CBS 2006c).  \nLess clear-cut were the developments in terms of employment. Since Amsterdam is also \nthe controlling centre of Dutch financial retail activities, domiciling two of the three large Dutch \nretail banks (ING and ABN AMRO), the employment gains caused by growth in wholesale \nactivities were largely offset by huge labour reductions in retail banking because of the \nintroduction of ICT during the 1980s and 1990s, the disappearance of many retail offices as a \nresult of market consolidation,2 and the rapidly increasing replacement of full scale retail bank \nfacilities by ATM\u2019s,3 all of which have had a downward effect on employment (G10 2003). \nNevertheless, during the 1990s the employment in the Amsterdam financial industry increased \nwith more than 15,000 jobs between 1993 and 2001, which represents an increase of well over 30 \nper cent. Or to put it otherwise, in 2001 one in every eight workers in Amsterdam was directly \nemployed in the financial services against one in ten in the early 1990s. \n \n                                            \n2 Because of bank mergers, between 1997 and 2004 the number of bank offices in the \nNetherlands declined from 7,161 to 4,100 (CBS 2006d). \n3 Between 1997 and 2004 the number of ATM\u2019s in the Netherlands increased from 6,397 to \n7,889 (CBS 2006e). \n 17 \n3.2 Post-millennial Blues? \nSo far, the Clark and O\u2019Connor tale seems to hold true. Despite virtualization, consolidation and \ncontinuing globalization, Amsterdam\u2019s financial centre seemed to be able to withstand the \ngrowth of London and other financial centers (e.g. Frankfurt), assumingly because of its opaque \nand translucent markets. However, after the turn of the millennium things began to change. \nBanks and security traders shed workers, losing, on average, one fifth of employees between 2001 \nand 2003. According to the Dutch Society of Equity Analysts, the total number of analysts has \ndecreased by several hundred since 2001 (Het Financieele Dagblad 2003). Combined with the \nemployment effects of continuing downsizing and outsourcing in Dutch retail banking, this has \nresulted in a steady decline from a high of slightly over 50,000 workers in 2001 to 47,000 workers \nin 2003 and, according to the latest figures, 40,000 on January 1, 2006 (CBS 2006a; O+S 2006). \nThis is reflected in the decline of financial firms located in Amsterdam. Since 1998 when there \nwere 79 foreign financial firms in Amsterdam, their number has steadily declined to 39 in 2004. \nEven more telling are the developments in the number of brokers located in Amsterdam. Of the \n26 officially recognized brokers that were located in Amsterdam in 1975 only 7 have survived. \nThe rest has disappeared through mergers, takeovers, closures or relocations. Of the 176 current \nmembers of Euronext who have a license to trade on the Amsterdam electronic order book only \n54 are actually located in Amsterdam. This number encompasses the remaining Amsterdam \nbrokers, foreign banks as well as Dutch universal banks (NIBE-SVV 2005). Moreover, an \nincreasing number of foreign financial firms are licensed by the Dutch Financial Market \nAuthority to conduct business in the Netherlands without actually being located here. While their \nnumber reached 49 in 1993, it had increased to 371 in 2005 (DNB 2006). Because of remote \naccess ports there is no longer a functional need to be located in the immediate surrounding of a \nphysical exchange, while other potential advantages of co-location \u2014 specialized labor market, \nasymmetric information, the accessibility of social networks \u2014 have apparently also disappeared.  \nWhat was a virtuous growth cycle in the 1990s \u2014 more liquid markets attracting more \ntraders and investors, which, in turn attracted a growing number of firms tapping into \nAmsterdam\u2019s financial markets \u2014 has rapidly turned into a vicious one of decreasing liquidity, a \n 18 \ndeclining number of financial firms located in Amsterdam and a decreasing number of share \nissuances. While part of the explanation is of course cyclical and has to do with the worldwide \nslump in stock prices after the bursting of the ICT bubble, in contrast to the London Stock \nExchange, the New York Stock Exchange as well as Euronext at large, activity on the \nAmsterdam order book has remained lacklustre. Total monthly turnover on the Amsterdam \nexchange has decreased gradually from a high of EUR 153 billion in January 2001 to a low of \nEUR 33 billion in February 2003, a steep decline even when taking into account that as per \nOctober 2001 the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics shifted from a double counting measure of \nequity turnover to a single counting one (CBS 2006b). As table 2 indicates, such declines suggest \nthat Amsterdam runs the danger of becoming one of the smaller European international financial \ncentres. \n \n[ Table 2. about here ] \n \nWhile these developments clearly concern Clark and O\u2019Connor\u2019s transparent category and might \nbe explained by the centrifugal effects of larger pools of liquidity in neighbouring financial \ncentres such as London, Paris and Frankfurt, that is not the case with the post millennial \ndevelopments in the small and mid cap section of the Amsterdam stock exchange. Since we are \ndealing here with firms with total capitalization between EUR 150 million and EUR 1 billion in \nthe case of midcaps and less than EUR 150 million in the case of smallcaps, we can safely assume \nthat this is an investment category that falls largely outside the radar of mainstream equity \nanalysts. As such, these financial products clearly belong to Clark and O\u2019Connor\u2019s opaque \ncategory, which, according to their reasoning, would continue to provide local intermediaries (i.e. \nAmsterdam based brokers and analysts) competitive advantage over foreign financial service \nproviders because of information asymmetries. However, between 2001 and 2005 no less than 69 \nfirms have left the Amsterdam exchange, 13 because of bankruptcy and 56 because of mergers \nand delistings, a large number of them small and medium sized enterprises. Each year since 2001, \nincluding 2006, the Amsterdam exchange has lost between 4 to 8 per cent of its listings (VEB \n 19 \n2006). Attempts to counter these losses by Euronext, such as the low threshold Alternext order \nbook, have yet failed to attract newcomers. While 28 of the 72 new listings on the Paris Bourse \nsince 2005 were on account of the Paris Alternext exchange, in Amsterdam the number of IPOs \nwas only five. The success of Paris Alternext appears to be largely due to fiscal subsidies and \nfinancial guarantees of the French Ministry of Finance for investors in SMEs quoted on the \nAlternext exchange. The Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs has already announced that no \nsubsidies and guarantees will be forthcoming even though Alternext Amsterdam did receive a \nlicence to operate from the Minister of Finance on May 30 2006 (Het Financieele Dagblad \n2006a). \nThe category of translucent products was defined above as an intermediate product \ncategory, linked to highly sophisticated financial agents such as hedge funds, that has only \nrecently become a main attractor for buyers and sellers. What is striking about the Amsterdam \ncase is the failure to develop a market in alternative investments, as it is called by the industry \nitself, and hence the absence of a vibrant community of smaller alternative financial firms. \nApproximately two third (74 %) of the 900 hedge funds active in Europe are located in London, \nwhich, moreover, controls more than 90 per cent of all European capital invested in hedge funds \n(IFSL 2005), making London the hedge fund capital of Europe. Smaller clusters of hedge funds \ncan be found in Paris and Madrid, while Zurich, Geneva, Stockholm, Luxembourg and Dublin \nare in the ascendancy. According to the Dutch Financial Market Authority there are only five \nsingle-manager hedge funds authorised for distribution in the Netherlands. This is the same \nnumber as in 2002 (AFM 2005). However, hedge funds are only obliged to get authorization if \nthe fund has more than hundred participants and\/or the participations are less than EUR 50,000. \nHence, these figures fail to capture Amsterdam located hedge funds like Aster-X, Theta Multistar \nand Go-Capital, whose participatory thresholds are over EUR 50,000. Much larger is the number \nof fund of hedge funds in the Netherlands. The register of the Financial Market Authority lists 35 \nof these funds licensed to distribute in the Netherlands. However, roughly half of these are \noperating out of Luxembourg (AFM 2005: 29). While Amsterdam clearly is the capital of the \n 20 \nDutch hedge fund industry, its size is too small to generate the type of self-sustaining innovation \ncycle that is visible in London (Financial Times 2006b). \nIn short, in all three categories identified by Clark and O\u2019Connor (1997), Amsterdam\u2019s \nfinancial centre seems to have lost clout. In the category of transparent products, the trading \nagents increasingly seem to have exchanged their Amsterdam location for establishments in \nlarger financial centres such as London, Paris and Frankfurt. We content that this is largely \nbecause access to transparent trading opportunities that used to be provided exclusively by the \nAmsterdam exchanges have increasingly, as a result of virtualization and remote access ports, \nbecome accessible through other means. As such, this development is still within the boundaries \nof Clark and O\u2019Connor\u2019s framework, simply suggesting that the importance of the integration \nwithin a local trading community to gain interpretative trading advantages is diminishing or is \nitself shifting to a higher order trading community (i.e. the one based in London). Harder to \naccommodate, however are the developments within the small and midcap section of the \nAmsterdam exchange. These types of assets clearly fall within the opaque category and as such \nwould represent the \u2018sticky\u2019 type of trade that should remain the prerogative of the local (or \nnational) trading communities despite increasing globalization and the ensuing pull of larger \nfinancial centres. Nevertheless, in this product category too there are clear indications of decline. \nFinally the failure to develop a viable community of traders in translucent products suggests that \nthere are interaction effects at work between the different product types and their respective \ntrading communities, which can explain both success and failure in reproducing financial \nadvantages.  \n \n3.3 Accounting for Decline \nThe questions raised by this case can be reconsidered in several ways. For example, at a generic \nlevel, has Amsterdam become less competitive in comparison to London and other European \nfinancial centres in terms of the presence\/absence of knowledgeable workers and the availability \nof business infrastructures (e.g. Corporation of London 2005)? Alternatively, this argument could \nbe complicated further by looking at both the changes in financial products (\u00e0 la Clark and \n 21 \nO\u2019Connor 1997) and also the \u2018relational\u2019 impacts on Amsterdam of changes in London and other \nfinancial centres in recent times (Beaverstock et al. 2005; Faulconbridge 2004). We argue that \nthere is somewhat of a \u2018chicken or egg\u2019 dilemma in terms of causality when examining changes in \nthe levels of transparent and opaque products traded in Amsterdam. Three points are relevant in \nour view in relation to this argument. \nFirst, it seems that to understand the decline of Amsterdam it is vital to accommodate \ninto the analyses changes over time in the knowledge intensity of different financial products and \nthe degree of epistemic embeddedness of the groups of traders specializing in these products. In \nterms of opaque products, local players operating in Amsterdam seem to have lost their \nmonopoly of local information gathering and with it the advantages associated with \n\u2018embeddedness\u2019 in local epistemic communities. Despite a flurry of activities within the social \nstudies of finance subdiscipline (see Carruthers and Stinchcombe 1999; Beunza and Garud 2005 \nArnoldi 2006), there is still a dearth of empirical studies on the activities of traders to state \nconclusively how they obtain their information and how they assess the inherent risks.  \nNevertheless, on the basis of the material available we can plausibly suggest that the \n\u2018local\u2019 knowledge which used to be opaque to outsiders and which provided a monopolistic niche \nfor local, intermediary agents is decreasingly so. Due to increases in computing powers, \nstandardizing agents like rating agencies (Moody\u2019s; Standard & Poor\u2019s; Fitch), transnational \nregulatory organizations (BIS; ECB; IOSCO), exchange organizations (Euronext; LSE; Deutsche \nB\u00f6rse; Dow Jones Stoxx), financial information brokers (Bloomberg; Reuters; Thomson data) \nand private research institutes (Eurohedge; Institutional Investor; The Banker; Mar\/Hedge) have \nincreasingly been able to construct integrated, (quasi) transparent markets which dispense with \nlocal epistemic advantages. In fact, the added value of these agents and hence the source of their \nprofits lies precisely in eroding informational asymmetries, whether caused by regulation, \nopaqueness or time lags, in order to give investors a larger choice of investment opportunities.4  \nAmsterdam\u2019s decline would thus seem to be the result of a loss in competitive advantage \nand failure to replace it with anything new in the form of innovative opaque and translucent \n                                            \n4 See Sinclair (2005) for precisely such an argument regarding the role of American rating \nagencies like Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s in the creation of worldwide bond markets. \n 22 \nproducts that rely on locally-specific and embedded knowledge communities, as London and \nother centres have done. Moreover, whilst the departure of transparent trading might have been \nexpected, it seems this may have been amplified (or caused?) by the gradual disappearance of \n\u2018opaque\u2019 products from the centre\u2019s exchanges. A case in point is the recent closure of the potato \nfutures market in Amsterdam. Established in 1958 and located in the Amsterdam commodities \nexchange it serviced Dutch, German and Belgium farmers and provided them with an alternative \noutlet for their produce to the large wholesalers. Being integrated in Euronext.Liffe and hence \nbeing managed out of London the organizational support was insufficient to maintain a lively \nfutures market in Amsterdam. While in 1998 144 thousand contracts were still being traded, in \n2004 their number had declined to a mere 26 thousand. Since the costs of maintaining the market \noutweighed the gains, Euronext.Liffe has decided to close down the platform (Het Financieele \nDagblad 2006b). While rational from an organizational perspective, the closure of markets like \nthese is much less commendable for future innovation possibilities within the Amsterdam \nfinancial centre as such. For the Amsterdam case clearly shows that there are product, market \nand trader complementarities, which are important for the innovative capabilities of IFC\u2019s. \nUnderstanding this dynamic is vital and leads us to our second argument.  \nThe effect of the inability of Amsterdam\u2019s financial community to reproduce \u2018opaque\u2019 \nfinancial products needs exploring. The 1990s have seen an enormous increase in the importance \nof complex financial products, consisting of an assemblage of financial assets with different risk, \nreturn and liquidity profiles. These are demanded by highly sophisticated institutional investors \nand their intermediaries in order to reap returns over and above those provided by more \nmainstream (transparent) assets. At the most cutting edge of this type of financial trading are \nboth the large international financial institutions and the \u2018new\u2019 communities of \u2018boutiques\u2019 and \n\u2018hedge funds\u2019, which increasingly mimic the organizational structure of the film and advertising \nindustry and the \u2018project ecologies\u2019 in which these are embedded (Grabher 2004; Hall 2006; The \nEconomist 2006). Both in these boutiques and in the larger financial institutions, the networks \nand expertise of individuals are used to maximise profit from complex financial transactions. \nSuch an ecology requires both a circumscribed arena where these professionals can first learn the \n 23 \ntrade and subsequently built up a network of collaborators, meet other investors and look for \nsophisticated customers. As the lack of a viable hedge fund community in Amsterdam indicates, \nthese conditions were either absent or had been eroded too much to sustain the sort of epistemic \nexchange from which financial innovation springs forth. This raises two questions. First, whether \nthe absence of traders in translucent products was primarily due to a decline in opaque products \nor, alternatively, in transparent products. In other words, is the future viability of smaller scale \nIFCs primarily dependent on the presence of agents that can mediate between outsiders and local \nopaque products (gatekeepers) or on the presence of traders who can transform transparent \nproducts into translucent, higher rewarding ones?  \nThird, it is important to examine the linkage between declines in liquidity, trade in \ntransparent products and the financial innovation that leads to the development of translucent \nproducts. In the light of the Amsterdam case it is evident that there are functional relations \nbetween the different categories, suggesting that loss of trade in one category spills over in the \nother and vice versa. For example, the rise of remote access may have allowed foreign financial \ninstitutions to leave Amsterdam, thus seriously weakening the epistemic \u2018infrastructure\u2019 that is \nrequired for financial innovation. The difficulty with this line of argument, though, is that, as \nClark et al. (2006) note, there are intrinsic \u2018home country\u2019 advantages even for transparent trade. \nFollowing this argument to its logical end, financial institutions would only want to leave a centre \nif these intrinsic \u2018home country\u2019 advantages decline (which they don\u2019t yet seem to have done) or \nif some other factor affecting the profitability of their presence spurred the abandonment of a \nfinancial centre. A critical case in point is the consolidation under British law of the Shell Oil \nCorporation. Since July 2005 the shares of the British and Dutch branches of Shell have been \ntransformed in dually listed RDS-A (formerly Royal Dutch Oil) and RDS-B shares. Based on \nliquidity arguments, the directors of Euronext Amsterdam feared that most trade would leak \naway. In view of the fact that Royal Dutch Oil trades accounted for 15 per cent of average daily \nturnover, this would wreak havoc on Amsterdam\u2019s liquidity. However, due to regulatory \ndisadvantages of the LSE \u2014 a \u2018stamp duty\u2019 of 0,5 percent raised on every share transaction \u2014 \nand sufficient initial liquidity in Amsterdam, over 70 percent of trade in RDS-A has remained in \n 24 \nAmsterdam. As a result the spread in Amsterdam on RDS-A shares is four percentage points \nlower than in London, making Amsterdam still the most attractive location to conduct Shell \ntrades. This was given a further boost in November 2005 when Dow Jones Stoxx announced \nthat it would include the Amsterdam Shell price in its European index. However, it remains to be \nseen how durable this distribution of trade is going to be, since Shell itself also prefers the \nAmsterdam order book to effectuate its share buy back programs. In the future this could well \nresult in a gradual decline of the number of \u2018Dutch\u2019 shares vis-\u00e0-vis the British ones and hence in \na loss of liquidity for the Amsterdam exchange and a rise in the spread between bid and offer \nprices.  \nAmsterdam\u2019s relationality, both with the other members of the Euronext consortium \nand within a wider European financial system where London dominates as the leading centre, \nalso means that only products with a high degree of \u2018stickiness\u2019 \u2013 the most opaque products \u2013 \nwill attract traders and compel their presence in the city. Whilst \u2018home country\u2019 advantages still \nexist for transparent trading, these do not seem to be big enough to override the compulsion of \nthe leading financial institutions to centralise their activities in centres which are known for \nfinancial innovation. Neither do they impinge on the attractiveness of the largest centres where \neconomies of scale can be gained \u2013 in Europe particularly London, where leading Amsterdam-\nbased (but multiply listed) stocks such as ING, ABN Amro, Aegon and Philips figure in the \nportfolios of major international institutions.  \n \n4. Discussion and Conclusions: Interpreting the Influences on European Financial \nGeographies \n \nThis paper has argued that there is much that remains to be done in order to fully understand the \ncomplex dynamics of European financial geographies and the changing roles of the multiple \nIFCs in Europe. In particular, by drawing on studies of the effects of the virtualization of stock \nexchanges on financial geographies and the importance of epistemic \u2018infrastructures\u2019 for financial \nactivities, it has shown that the spatial distribution of activities within the new international \n 25 \nfinancial system is, in many ways, inherently linked to both the characteristics and relative \nstrengths and weaknesses of different financial centres but also to the relational networks that tie \ncentres together and into wider global financial networks. \nIn doing so, the analysis has in some ways echoed previous research focussing upon \nLondon\u2019s changing role in European finance (Beaverstock et al. 2005; Clark 2002; Faulconbridge \n2004; Thrift 2000). All of these studies have noted the importance of London\u2019s competitive \nurban infrastructure, regulation and global interconnectivity and their effects upon the city\u2019s \nsustenance as a leading IFC both within Europe and globally. They have also argued that \n\u2018product complementarities\u2019 and the prevalence of knowledge-intensive, \u2018sticky\u2019 financial \nproducts in London are integral to the city\u2019s continued growth. \nWhat this paper has offered to further this cause, however, is a deeper foray into the \ncomplex world of financial products and their complementarities, which emphasizes the \ninterdependencies between transparent, translucent and opaque products and the way liquidity, \ninnovation and regulation are at the centre of these relationships. This has allowed us to identify \nthe intricate linkages between different categories of financial products and the potential for \nfeedback mechanisms that impact upon an IFCs long term sustenance and growth within global \nrelational networks. The case of Amsterdam has revealed that the vibrancy of an IFC is \ndetermined by the skill and the number of its opaque and translucent traders, but that these, in \nturn, are crucially related to an underlying \u2018infrastructure\u2019 that has been able to pool large \n\u2018chunks\u2019 of capital \u2013 something that London possesses in abundance. \nIn this regard the upshot is that transparency, and hence liquidity, is not a given but is \nactively \u2018produced\u2019, as is demonstrated by the \u2018construction\u2019 of an international real estate market \nthrough the commodification of so-called \u2018mortgage-backed securities\u2019 (see Carruthers and \nStinchcome 1999; Gotham 2006). Far from falsifying the explanatory adequacy of the product-\ninformation based framework used in this paper, the \u2018plasticity\u2019 of the categories, which, if our \nanalysis is correct, is crucial for understanding the fate of different financial centres, can only be \nmade visible on the basis of a typology of different ideal types such as the Clark and O\u2019Connor \none. In this we merely follow Max Weber\u2019s prescriptions. Our categories should be understood \n 26 \nas theoretical conceptualizations of a complex and layered social reality which allow us to focus \non the discrepancies between the two \u2014 ideal type and empirical observations \u2014 in order to \nprovide adequate explanations for these empirical \u2018anomalies\u2019 (Weber 1972: 3; Swedberg 1998: \n193-4).  \nWith regard to the reconfiguration of the stock exchange landscape and the emergence \nof the Euronext consortium, finally, there is a need to understand whether Amsterdam\u2019s \nwithering role in European finance can be explained by studying the complementarity of \ndifferent types of financial products and the overlap between the different communities of \ntraders only. Throughout the story we meet the effects of regulatory interventions, which seem to \nhave been determinant for the future course of developments within different IFCs. For \nexample, the failure to back the development of a low threshold equity market by the Dutch \nMinister of Finance may well seal the fate of the Amsterdam exchange as a source of capital for \ngrowing Dutch firms. Furthermore, the early lifting of capital movement restrictions by the \nDutch authorities may well have been to the advantage of large Dutch financial institutes, while \ngradually eroding the standing of the Amsterdam financial centre. Finally, the \u2018battle of the \nbourses\u2019 that is currently reaching its endspiel may well result in a further loss of discretionary \nmanoeuvring space for the directors of Euronext Amsterdam. It is, in any case, indicative that \nthe Dutch authorities, in contrast to the German, the French, and the British, have until now \nremained silent over the distribution of employees, activities and prestige over the different IFCs \ninvolved. Either intended or unintended, there is a case to be made for the suggestion that \ninstitutional changes are the ultimate causes underlying the current reconfiguration of the \nEuropean financial landscape, while shifts in liquidity and kinds of trades are merely proximate \nones. However, as stressed above, how these types of causes are related is still very much up for \ngrabs.  \n 27 \nReferences \n \nAbolafia, M.Y. 2004.
