Ionosphere (Plasma convection) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (Auroral phenomena; Magnetosphere-\nionosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nMagnetospheric substorms are a major contributing factor\nto large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics and give\nrise to some of the most significant auroral and magneto-\nspheric disturbances that occur in the terrestrial system. As a\nconsequence they have been extensively studied over the past\n40 years and many aspects of their large-scale behaviour have\nbeen very well described. The earliest observations of sub-\nstorms were, of course, of the auroral breakup although the\nidea of the auroral substorm was not conceived until Akasofu\n(1963, 1964) developed his picture of the auroral morphol-\nogy. At about the same time, substorm magnetic signatures\nand their implied current systems were identified (Bostrom,\n1964; Akasofu et al., 1965; Atkinson, 1967; Akasofu, 1968;\nAkasofu and Meng, 1969), although it was not until the ad-\nvent of satellite data that the 3-D nature of the substorm cur-\nrent wedge was visualised (McPherron et al., 1973). In the\nyears since, the increasing availability of space-borne im-\nagery and in-situ magnetospheric observations has vastly im-\nproved our ability to study the spatial and temporal dynam-\nics of the aurora (e.g. Elphinstone et al., 1996 and references\ntherein) as well as to understand their associated magneto-\nspheric phenomena (e.g. McPherron et al., 1973; Akasofu,\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3366 A. Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics\n1977; McPherron, 1979, 1991; Hones, 1979; Baker et al.,\n1984).\nEarly studies of substorm current systems, such as those\nmentioned above, identified two distinct patterns of iono-\nspheric currents (e.g. Clauer and Kamide, 1985). The first\nof these, referred to as DP-2 (disturbance polar of the second\ntype), corresponds to the twin-vortex current pattern driven\nby magnetospheric convection, and the resulting eastward\nand westward convection electrojets in the dawn and dusk au-\nroral zones. McPherron (1970) interpreted this current sys-\ntem as being created by a substorm growth phase in which\nenergy extracted from the solar wind is stored in the mag-\nnetosphere. During this interval an enhancement in mag-\nnetospheric and ionospheric convection, being driven by re-\nconnection at the dayside magnetopause, causes an increase\nin the size of the polar cap and a growth in the convection\nelectrojets. The second pattern, DP-1, corresponds to the\nionospheric portion of the substorm current wedge and takes\nthe form of an enhanced westward current in the midnight\nsector auroral zone called the substorm electrojet (Akasofu\net al., 1965). This current system is governed by enhance-\nments in conductivity rather than in the electric field (Lester,\n2000), a fact which has spawned considerable debate over the\nmagnitude and physical implications of electric fields during\nthe substorm expansion phase. Increasingly, however, direct\nstudies of convection during the expansion phase (such as\nthose made using HF radars, for example) are revealing more\nabout the significance of magnetospheric electric fields in the\noverall nature of substorm electrodynamics, as we discuss\nbelow.\nOne area of recent advancement in our understanding of\nconvection processes during the substorm expansion phase\nconcerns the large-scale reconfiguration of the magneto-\nsphere. In a study of Sondrestrom radar data, Blanchard\net al. (1997) (following earlier work by de la Beaujardie`re\net al. (1991) and Blanchard et al. (1996)) measured the local\nreconnection rate by examining the ionospheric flow across\nthe open-closed field line boundary, the position of the lat-\nter being estimated from ionospheric features observed by\nthe radar and from 630 nm auroral emissions. They found\nthat an increase in the reconnection rate occurs near midnight\nshortly after expansion phase onset, expanding to encompass\na wider local time sector after \u223c20 min. However, the ini-\ntial reconnection rate increase was mainly manifest in a pole-\nward motion of the inferred open-closed field line boundary.\nFlows were found to become elevated only after an inter-\nval of \u223c30 min. Somewhat correspondingly, Weimer (1999)\nhas presented a statistical survey of low-altitude electric field\ndata from the DE\u20132 spacecraft, separated according to the\nIMF direction and into substorm and non-substorm inter-\nvals. The flow patterns for a given IMF orientation show a\nmore pronounced \u201cHarang\u201d asymmetry on the nightside dur-\ning substorm intervals than during non-substorm intervals,\nbut the total transpolar voltage values showed little over-\nall difference. On the other hand, Opgenoorth and Pelli-\nnen (1998), following earlier work by Grafe et al. (1987),\nhave presented evidence for flow enhancements in the dusk\nauroral zone immediately following expansion phase onset\nin the midnight sector, leading to an immediate increase in\nthe global convection-driven current system. They suggest,\nhowever, that diversion of the twin-vortex flow around the\nlow-flow, high-conductivity auroral bulge formed during the\nexpansion phase (e.g. Kirkwood et al., 1988; Morelli et al.,\n1995; Yeoman et al., 2000; Bristow et al., 2001; Khan et al.,\n2001), may play a role in this enhancement.\nCowley and Lockwood (1992) (following earlier work on\nboundary motions and flows presented by Russell (1972),\nSiscoe and Huang (1985) and Freeman and Southwood\n(1988)) supposed that significant large-scale twin-vortex\nflows should be excited during substorms, corresponding in\nessence to the DP-2 current systems associated with dayside-\ndriven convection cited above. Fox et al. (1999) reported\nobservations of a surge of transpolar flow into the midnight\nsector associated with a substorm intensification, which they\nsuggest was due to a burst of reconnection in the tail. Gro-\ncott et al. (2000, 2002) presented analyses of Super Dual\nAuroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) flow data obtained\nduring isolated substorms, and have found evidence for the\nexcitation of twin-vortex flow cells centred in the night-\nside ionosphere, which enhance the transpolar voltage by\n\u223c40 kV compared with pre-onset values. Following this\nwork, Provan et al. (2004) conducted a statistical study of\nsubstorm flows and found them to become enhanced across\nthe polar cap and in the low-latitude return flow region. They\nalso found a systematic increase in the transpolar voltage\nfrom\u223c40 kV 2 min before onset to\u223c75 kV 12 min after, and\nattributed this to the removal of open flux from the polar cap\nby nightside reconnection. Recently, Liang et al. (2006) (fol-\nlowing earlier work by Kamide et al. (1994)) discussed ob-\nservations of two distinct systems in the substorm convection\npattern. The first is a post-midnight anticlockwise convection\nvortex (PoACV) at higher latitudes and the second is an az-\nimuthally extended clockwise vortex at lower latitudes. They\nexplain these in terms of a combination of the nightside re-\nconnection driven twin-vortex flows and those resulting from\nfield line slippage processes associated with dipolarisation\n(Lui and Kamide, 2003).\nWhilst it is thus becoming clear that large-scale electric\nfields play a significant role in the electrodynamics of the\nsubstorm expansion phase, it is also apparent that mesoscale\nphenomena are integral to the substorm process. For ex-\nample, azimuthally-localised impulsive events have been ob-\nserved in which auroras are first intensified at the poleward\nboundary of the nightside auroral zone, and then expand\nequatorward, reaching to near the equatorward boundary of\nthe oval emissions after \u223c5 min (Henderson et al., 1998).\nThese events, termed \u201cpoleward boundary intensifications\u201d\n(PBIs) by Lyons et al. (1999), have been found to occur in\nall phases of the substorm cycle, including during long in-\ntervals of magnetic quiet, though they appear to be more\nAnn.

They are associ-\nated with azimuthally-localised \u201cbursty bulk flows\u201d (BBFs)\nin the near-Earth plasma sheet (Baumjohann et al., 1990; An-\ngelopoulos et al., 1992; Yeoman et al., 1998; Lyons et al.,\n1999) or \u201crapid flux transport\u201d (RFT) events (Scho\u00a8del et al.,\n2001a, b) and the excitation of flow in the ionosphere (de la\nBeaujardie`re et al., 1994; Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997; Watan-\nabe et al., 1998; Grocott et al., 2004; Nakamura et al., 2005).\nAs discussed, for example, by Cowley (1998), and Cowley et\nal. (1998), these features are strongly suggestive of the occur-\nrence of localised impulsive reconnection in the tail. Pseu-\ndobreakups, occurring during substorm growth phase, have\nalso been associated with BBFs (e.g. Grocott et al., 2004) and\nhave been shown to accompany significant enhancements in\nthe nightside flux closure rate (Hubert et al., 2006).\nAnother series of substorm related phenomena believed\nto drive magnetospheric circulation are the polarisation\njets (PJs) (Galperin et al., 1973), or sub-auroral ion drifts\n(SAIDs) (Spiro et al., 1979). PJ\/SAIDs are fast (1\u20134 km s\u22121)\nnarrow (1\u20132\u25e63) channels of westward plasma flow which\noccur just equatorward of the equatorward edge of the au-\nroral oval in the evening sector. They result from the forma-\ntion of radial polarisation electric fields in the inner magne-\ntosphere (which map to poleward electric fields in the sub-\nauroral ionosphere) which themselves develop as a result of\nthe charge separation caused by the penetration of partial ring\ncurrent ions to a lower L-shell than plasma sheet electrons\n(Foster, 1995). Related phenomena have also been identi-\nfied in radar data such as substorm-associated radar auroral\nsurges (SARAS) (Freeman et al., 1992; Shand et al., 1998)\nand auroral westward flow channels (AWFCs) (Parkinson\net al., 2003, 2005a, b). AWFCs, however, have been ob-\nserved to grow at substorm onset and decay during the re-\ncovery phase (Parkinson et al., 2005b) whereas PJ\/SAIDs\nidentified in satellite data appear during recovery (Anderson\net al., 1993). Foster and Burke (2002) use the term \u2018sub-\nauroral polarisation stream\u2019 (SAPS) to encompass all of these\nphenomena, which includes broader (3\u20135\u25e63), weaker (100\u2013\n400 m s\u22121), background flows which persist beyond mid-\nnight into the predawn sector. These sub-auroral electric\nfields play critical roles in energising and transporting ring\ncurrent ions as well as convecting thermal plasma in the in-\nner magnetosphere and mid- to low-latitude ionosphere (Fos-\nter and Vo, 2002).\nThere is little doubt that the wealth of observations which\nexist, such as those described above, have revealed much\nabout substorms and substorm-related phenomena. One re-\nmaining gap in our knowledge stems from the fact that onset\noccurs at the equatorward edge of the auroral oval which is\noften outside of, or at the nearest ranges of, the SuperDARN\nradar fields-of-view. This has a particular impact on our\nability to study sub-auroral substorm flows, the importance\nof which is further demonstrated in the present study. The\nTIGER radar pair are amongst only a few radars which can\nobserve the flows at these lower-latitudes, although they have\nrecently been joined by a new radar on Wallops Island (in the\nnorthern hemisphere) (Oksavik et al., 2006), the first of the\nnew mid-latitude StormDARN array, which will ultimately\nextend SuperDARN coverage down to \u223c40\u25e6. By combining\nour ability to observe large-scale substorm electrodynamics\nusing combined radar and auroral studies with in-situ ob-\nservations from bespoke multi-spacecraft substorm missions\nsuch as THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale\nInteractions during Substorms) we will soon be in an ideal\nposition to complete a synthesis of substorm physics. Be-\nfore this is possible, however, it is essential that we have a\ndetailed framework of substorm electrodynamics in which to\nwork.\nIn this paper, electric field and auroral signatures of an\ninterval of substorm activity which occurred between 08:35\nand 12:00 UT on 21 November 2004 are discussed. Unusu-\nally for an interval of considerable activity (the ground mag-\nnetic disturbance peaked in excess of 1000 nT) good cover-\nage of HF radar data from the SuperDARN network exists in\nthe region of the substorm bulge. This has enabled the spa-\ntial and temporal development of many different elements\nof the substorm process to be reconciled, including the large-\nscale excitation of equatorward flow out of the polar cap after\nsubstorm onset, the occurrence of transient flow features and\ntheir relationship to auroral brightenings, the morphology of\nthe substorm current wedge and Harang discontinuity, and\nthe development of sub-auroral flows. These observations\nare discussed in the context of recent substorm theory pro-\nviding an up to date synthesis of our current understanding\nof substorm electrodynamics.\n2 Instrumentation\nThis study combines simultaneous measurements from a\nnumber of sources to investigate the flow, magnetic, and au-\nroral signatures associated with a magnetospheric substorm\non 21 November 2004. Ionospheric convection velocities\nare provided primarily by the Tasman International Geospace\nEnviroment Radars (TIGER) HF system (Dyson et al., 2000),\nwhich forms part of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN), an international array of HF coherent radars\nspanning the auroral regions of both the northern and south-\nern hemispheres (Greenwald et al., 1995). Data from the en-\ntire southern hemisphere SuperDARN network, which con-\nsisted of seven radars during the interval being studied, is\nalso used to provide a global solution to the ionospheric elec-\ntric potential, and hence the global convection pattern. This\nis achieved using the Map Potential technique (Ruohoniemi\nand Baker, 1998) which fits the line-of-sight SuperDARN\ndata to an 8th order expansion (in this case) of the electro-\nstatic potential in spherical harmonics. Information from the\nstatistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996), pa-\nrameterised by IMF conditions, is used to stabilise the solu-\ntion in regions where no measurements are available. It is\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3365\u20133381, 2006\n3368 A. Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics\nFig. 1.

The region containing\nthe TIGER radar pair is enlarged in the bottom panel, which is the\nsame region in which flow and auroral data are displayed. Beams 2\nand 11 of the TIGER Unwin radar (U) and beams 2 and 14 of the\nTIGER Bruny Island radar (R) are indicated by the darker shaded\nregions of the fields-of-view and labelled on the top and right-hand\naxes. The field-of-view of the (northern hemisphere) King Salmon\nradar, is shown dashed. Also shown on both panels are the location\nof the MacQuarie Island magnetometer, which is located close to\nthe onset region of the substorm, and the locations of four magne-\ntometers from the northern hemisphere Alaskan array.\nimportant to stress that these statistical average patterns do\nnot represent local convection features under atypical condi-\ntions such as a substorm surge and detailed interpretation of\nthe local convection pattern in regions of poor data coverage\nis therefore not possible. Data from a single northern hemi-\nsphere radar (King Salmon) are also presented. During the\nstudy interval all radars were operating in a standard mode\nin which each scanned through 16 beams of azimuthal sep-\naration 3.24\u25e6, with a total scan time of 1 min. Each beam is\ndivided into 75 range gates of length 45 km, and so in each\nfull scan the radar covered 52\u25e6 in azimuth and over 3000 km\nin range, an area of over 4\u00d7106 km2.\nThe fields-of-view at 10:00 UT of the full southern hemi-\nsphere SuperDARN array are illustrated in the top panel\nof Fig. 1, which is presented in the magnetic local time-\n(MLT) magnetic latitude coordinate system \u201cAltitude Ad-\njusted Corrected Geomagnetic\u201d (AACGM), a development\nof the PACE coordinate system discussed by Baker and Wing\n(1989). As is the convention when working with southern\nhemisphere SuperDARN data, this is a view looking down\nfrom the northern hemisphere, such that dusk is to the left and\ndawn is to the right. The region containing the TIGER radar\npair is enlarged in the bottom panel, which is the same re-\ngion in which the flow and auroral maps are displayed below.\nBeams 2 and 11 of the TIGER Unwin radar (U) and beams 2\nand 14 of the TIGER Bruny Island radar (R), data from which\nare presented later in the paper, are indicated by the darker\nshaded regions of the fields-of-view and labelled on the top\nand right-hand axes. The field-of-view of the (northern hemi-\nsphere) King Salmon radar, is shown dashed. Also shown on\nboth panels are the location of the MacQuarie Island mag-\nnetometer, which is located close to the onset region of the\nsubstorm, and the locations of four magnetometers from the\nnorthern hemisphere Alaskan array. The use of these north-\nern hemisphere magnetometers was necessitated by the lack\nof additional southern hemisphere observatories in the vicin-\nity of the substorm bulge.\nIn addition, data from two spacecraft have also been used\nin this study. First, the Advanced Composition Explorer\n(ACE) spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998), located upstream of the\nEarth at GSM coordinates (X,Y,Z) = (243, 4, \u201310)RE , pro-\nvided interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data from the mag-\nnetometer (MAG) instrument (Smith et al., 1999) and solar\nwind data from the Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Mon-\nitor (SWEPAM) instrument (McComas et al., 1998). Sec-\nond, the Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) on board the Im-\nager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IM-\nAGE) spacecraft (Mende et al., 2000a, b) provided images\nof the aurora during the interval. This instrument viewed the\nwhole of the southern polar ionosphere during the course of\nthe interval, and provided images approximately every 5 min.\nThese consist of 5-s integrations of UV photons in the spec-\ntral region \u223c140\u2013190 nm. The resolution of each WIC pixel\nis approximately 52 km, comparable to the size of a Super-\nDARN range gate, discussed above.\nAnn.

Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics 3369\n3 Observations\n3.1 Auroral and magnetic substorm signatures\nAuroral and magnetic data, used to identify the time-line of\nsubstorm activity over the interval 0800 to 12:00 UT, are\nsummarised in Fig. 2. Panel (a) shows a keogram of the\nmaximum auroral intensity between 18 and 04 MLT, ob-\ntained from the FUV wideband imaging camera on the IM-\nAGE satellite. This was generated by selecting the maximum\nintensity pixel within this local time band for each latitude.\nIn this way, spatial variations in the aurora are not resolved\nbut full coverage of any temporal variations is achieved. The\nbar to the right of this panel indicates the colour-coded rel-\native intensity of the emissions. Panels (b) and (c) show\nband pass filtered (20\u2013200 s) H-component magnetometer\ndata from the MacQuarie Island and Arctic stations to il-\nlustrate Pi2 wave activity. Panels (d-g) show the unfiltered\nH-component data from the MacQuarie Island, Kaktovik,\nFt. Yukon, and Bettles stations. The time of the initial distur-\nbance is indicated by the first vertical dashed line at 08:35 UT\n(i), with subsequent intensifications also similarly marked\n(ii\u2013v). Closer inspection of the auroral images suggests that\nthis first brightening is in fact a pseudo breakup, with the ac-\ntual substorm expansion phase onset more likely correspond-\ning to the intensification at\u223c08:51 UT (ii) and the start of the\nmagnetic bay observed at Kaktovik. This second auroral in-\ntensification was also accompanied by a westward expansion\nof the auroral bulge (although at\u223c08:58 UT a further bright-\nening was initiated to the east, at \u223c23:00 MLT). The interval\nwould perhaps, therefore, be better described as a prolonged\ninterval of substorm activity, rather than as an isolated event.\nNevertheless, 08:35 UT coincided with the onset of Pi2 sig-\nnatures in both hemispheres and also with the first indication\nof any auroral brightening and will therefore be considered\nthe time of initial activity for the purposes of this paper.\nDuring the \u223c2 h following the initial brightening at\n08:35 UT a number of intensifications can be identified in the\nauroral data, all of which were accompanied by poleward ex-\ncursions of the poleward boundary of the auroral emissions.\nThis indicates that contractions of the polar cap, indicative\nof the closure of open magnetic flux via reconnection of lobe\nfield lines, were occurring at these times. In between sev-\neral of these intensifications there is also some evidence of\nrecovery phase behaviour (e.g. after 09:36 UT, prior to (iv)),\nboth in the magnetic data (i.e. the increase in H-component at\nKaktovik) and in the auroral data (the equatorward relaxation\nof the poleward boundary). This also suggests that dayside\nreconnection and open flux creation was ongoing through-\nout the interval. After the final intensification indicated at\n10:15 UT (v) the aurora experienced a prolonged equator-\nward relaxation of their poleward boundary, suggesting that\nthe magnetosphere had entered the recovery phase proper.\nWhilst there were some small perturbations in the magnetic\nH-component during the last hour of the interval, between\n\u223c11:00 and 12:00 UT, the lack of Pi2 signatures or addi-\ntional auroral breakup signatures would indicate that these\nare not related to further substorm intensifications. Finally, it\nshould be noted that the brightening at\u223c11:50 UT occurs af-\nter the viewing angle of the IMAGE spacecraft had become\ntoo oblique to perform a meaningful mapping and is there-\nfore not discussed.\n3.2 Solar wind and ionospheric electric field data\nTime-series summarising the upstream interplanetary and\nionospheric electric field data are presented in Fig. 3. The\nkeogram of IMAGE data (panel a) and vertical dashed lines\nfrom Fig. 2 are also reproduced for reference. The solar\nwind electric field, ESW , which has been determined from\nthe ACE upstream interplanetary data (\u2013VBZ) is shown in\npanel (b). This has been lagged by 45 min to account for\nthe propagation delay between the spacecraft and the day-\nside ionosphere, using the algorithm of Khan and Cowley\n(1999). Positive regions of ESW , corresponding to intervals\nof southward IMF and therefore to intervals of dayside driv-\ning by low-latitude reconnection, are shaded grey. Panel (c)\nshows electric potential information from the Map Potential\nanalysis. The black curve is the total transpolar voltage, VPC ,\ndetermined from the peaks in the potential from the analysis\nand therefore provides a global measure of the strength of\nthe convection. It is clear, however, that this is dominated by\nthe solar wind input, evidenced by the correlation between\nthe two. This is not unexpected owing to the limited data\ncoverage of the global convection pattern and its resultant\ndomination by the solar wind-governed statistical model (the\ndata coverage increases from \u223c1% of the polar cap at the\nstart of the interval to \u223c6% by 09:30 UT; by comparison,\na \u2018best case\u2019 convection map will contain data over \u223c30%).\nNevertheless, the enhancements in ESW \/ VPC , such as those\nobserved prior to (iv) and after (v), do suggest that the equa-\ntorward motions of the poleward edge of the auroral oval at\nthese times are therefore results of reconnection, and open\nflux production, at the dayside magnetopause.\nIsolating the voltage directly related to the flows in the\nsubstorm dominated (and radar data rich) region provides a\nbetter indication of the substorm-dominated variability. The\nred curve in panel (c) represents the maximum potential drop\nacross the auroral zone along the 21:00 MLT meridian, VAZ ,\nwith corresponding red axis on the right hand side. In these\ndata, enhancements which correlate more closely to the sub-\nstorm intensifications are revealed, such as those immedi-\nately after (iii) and (v). A more detailed picture of the sub-\nstorm flows can be derived from looking at radar line-of-sight\ndata from individual radar beams. Data from the four beams\nillustrated in Fig. 1 are presented in Fig. 3d\u2013g, colour-coded\naccording to the bar on the right. The poor data coverage\nat the start of the interval alluded to above is immediately\nevident, with the initial onset having no clear signature in\nthe limited backscatter. However, after the intensification at\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3365\u20133381, 2006\n3370 A. Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics\nFig. 2. Auroral and magnetic data, used to identify the time-line of substorm activity over the interval 0800 to 12:00 UT.

The bar to the right of this panel indicates the colour-coded relative intensity of the emissions. Panels (b) and (c) show Pi2 filtered\n(20\u2013200 s) H-component magnetometer data from the MacQuarie Island and Arctic stations. Panels (d\u2013g) show the unfiltered H-component\ndata from the MacQuarie Island, Kaktovik, Ft. Yukon, and Bettles stations. The time of the initial disturbance is indicated by the first vertical\ndashed line at 08:35 UT, with subsequent intensifications also similarly marked.\n08:51 UT (ii) the amount of near-range scatter began to im-\nprove in all four radar beams, followed by the appearance\nof some echoes from further ranges after about 09:10 UT.\nAt about 09:30 UT the amount of scatter observed by both\nradars improved considerably, and remained high through-\nout the succeeding intensifications and well into the recovery\nphase.\nThe nature of the flow throughout the interval can be sum-\nmarised as follows. Beam 2 of the Unwin radar measured\n\u201caway\u201d flow (i.e. negative Doppler velocities, colour-coded\nred in Fig. 3) throughout much of the interval, at speeds\nwhich peaked in excess of 500 m s\u22121. Referring to Fig. 1, and\nto the IMAGE keogram in panel (a), it can readily be seen\nthat these measurements represent sunward \u201creturn\u201d flow in\nthe dusk auroral zone. The remaining three beams, hav-\ning more meridional pointing directions, each observed two\nflow regimes. At near ranges they all also observed a com-\nponent of the sunward flow, away from the radar (Unwin,\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3365\u20133381, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/\nA.

The first\nof these flow bursts, for example, appeared at a magnetic lat-\nitude of about \u201371\u25e6 at \u223c09:10 UT on beam 11 of the Un-\nwin radar which, at that time, was closely aligned with the\n21:00 MLT meridian. In the space of \u223c15 mins the patch\nmoved equatorward to about \u201368\u25e6, crossing the auroral oval\nfrom its poleward edge to well within the auroral zone. This\nsuggests that the flow burst moved from a region of open field\nlines (in the polar cap) onto closed field lines and is there-\nfore a possible signature of reconnection in the tail. This is\nconsistent with observations of a bursty bulk flow (BBF) de-\ntailed by Grocott et al. (2004) and will be discussed further\nin Sect. 4.\n3.3 Auroral images and flow maps\nTwo-dimensional maps of the ionospheric flows and cor-\nresponding auroral images are shown in Fig. 4 from se-\nlected times over the interval spanning the substorm activity.\nThe times of the radar scans (indicated in the bottom left-\nhand corner of each panel) were chosen to best highlight the\nchanges which occurred over the interval including those as-\nsociated with the substorm intensifications. Superposed on\nthe line-of-sight radar data (left hand panels) are the elec-\ntric equipotentials from the Map Potential analysis, shown\nat 3 kV intervals, and the two dimensional fitted flow vec-\ntors. The accompanying auroral images (right hand panels)\nare those which most closely correspond to the times of the\nradar scans, their exact times being shown in the bottom left-\nhand corner of each image. On the far right, parameters from\nthe Map Potential analysis (see Sect. 2) are shown, includ-\ning the concurrent (lagged) IMF vector, the APL statistical\nmodel used and voltage across the 21:00 MLT auroral zone\nfrom Fig. 3.\nDuring the first \u223c50 mins of the interval there was insuffi-\ncient coverage of SuperDARN data in the premidnight sector\nto dominate the statistical model, and as such no interpreta-\ntion of the convection at the time of the first pseudobreakup\n(at 08:35 UT) is possible. By 08:54 UT, however, shortly\nafter onset of the main substorm electrojet, the amount of\nradar scatter was sufficient to produce a reasonable potential\npattern in the wider vicinity of the substorm bulge (panel a).\nComparing this pattern to the auroral data now reveals that\nthe bulge was located inside the clockwise vortex of the dusk\nconvection cell with the flow reversal boundary located in-\nside the auroral oval. The scatter was still fairly sparse, how-\never, and those flows which were observed are only mod-\nerate in magnitude at a few \u223c100 m s\u22121. The locations of\nthe radars at this UT were also not ideal to fully observe the\npre-midnight sector. By 09:10 UT (panel b) the amount of\nscatter had improved markedly, with flows of over 500 m s\u22121\nbeing evident in the vicinity of the substorm bulge, corre-\nsponding to one of the transient flow features seen in Fig. 3.\nThese flows appear to have been equatorward crossing the\nbulge, then turning westwards at lower latitudes. A signif-\nicant intensification is evident in the auroral emissions at\n09:25 UT (panel c), which is accompanied by yet further\nenhancements to both the amount of scatter present and to\nthe velocity of the flows which peak at \u223c800 m s\u22121. This is\nalso reflected in the voltage across the dusk convection cell,\nwhich has increased by 5 kV. The additional backscatter also\nserves to draw the potential pattern equatorward such that by\n09:36 UT (panel d) the auroral zone is shown to be contained\nentirely within the pre-midnight reversal region. Panels (c\u2013\ne) also show the development of the fast (\u223c700 m s\u22121) dusk-\nside sunward flows alluded to in reference to Fig. 3 above,\nevidenced both in the red and blue coloured scatter in the\ntwo radar fields-of-view, and in the enhanced voltage men-\ntioned above. By 09:45 UT (panel e) the fast equatorward\nflow at higher latitudes, out of the polar cap, had also reap-\npeared. The auroral emissions themselves, however, have\nsubsided somewhat (panels d\u2013e) consistent with the recov-\nery at 09:36 UT noted in the magnetometer data mentioned\nabove.\nImmediately after the fourth auroral intensification at\n09:54 UT (marked on Figs. 2 and 3) there was an apparent re-\nduction in the dusk auroral zone potential, although the flow\nvelocities themselves do not appear to have been dramati-\ncally reduced, still peaking in excess of 600 m s\u22121 (panel f).\nAn interesting feature is the apparent diversion of the flow\naround the enhanced portion of the poleward boundary of\nthe oval, with fast equatorward flows to the west of this re-\ngion still evident. Ten minutes later at 10:05 UT (panel g)\nthis patch of equatorward flow has shrunk somewhat, but\nhas also moved slightly poleward in concert with the pole-\nward edge of the oval. Both of these features are indicative\nof a poleward motion of the open-closed field line bound-\nary and therefore of nightside reconnection removing open\nflux from the polar cap. This time also marks the first in-\nstance when the radars are located sufficiently late in MLT\nto begin to reveal the Harang discontinuity, i.e., the eastward\nand westward flows in the pre-midnight reversal region. This\nfeature became even more well defined over the following\nhour (panels h\u2013j), with a sharp eastward kink in the flow evi-\ndent at\u223c\u201365\u25e63 just poleward of the fast westward \/ sunward\nflows between \u201360\u25e6 and \u201362\u25e63. Panel (h) also shows the last\nsignificant auroral intensification (beginning at 10:15 UT in\nFig. 2). This brightening occurred westward of the previous\none, at 21:00 MLT, and is again accompanied by a poleward\ncontraction of the oval. The poleward most band of scat-\nter has also moved poleward, although there is also a band\nof equatorward scatter to the east of the bulge at \u223c\u201370\u25e63.\nThe sunward flows have also re-intensified with a voltage of\n19 kV now existing across the 21:00 MLT auroral zone. An\nhour later (panel j), well into the recovery phase of the sub-\nstorm, the Harang and sub-auroral flows were still very well\ndefined.\nAnn.

Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics 3375\n4 Discussion\nSubstorms have been associated with a wide variety of auro-\nral, magnetic field and plasma flow phenomena, the combi-\nnation of which serves to produce a very complicated over-\nall picture of substorm electrodynamics. In particular, when\nstudied individually, only so much can be learned about the\nrole of these phenomena in substorm physics. The present\ndataset is unique, however, in that it has enabled the simulta-\nneous observation of a number of these phenomena, reveal-\ning much about their relationship with each other, and plac-\ning them within a larger conceptual framework.\n4.1 The large-scale picture\nAlthough radar data coverage outside of the substorm-\ndisturbed region is limited during this interval, the existence\nof significant flow signatures both in the polar cap and in the\nauroral zone serves to constrain the large-scale convection\npattern, at least in the context of substorm activity. For ex-\nample, the excitation of flow at the poleward edge of the au-\nroral oval which is evident after 09:10 UT (Fig. 4) is strongly\nindicative of the excitation of Dungey-cycle convection as\nreported by, e.g. Grocott et al. (2002). Indeed, the fact that\nthese flows clearly cross the open-closed field line bound-\nary implies reconnection driven flow. The development of\nthese flows over the course of the expansion phase, rather\nthan an instantaneous appearance at the time of substorm on-\nset, is corroborated by other recent studies such as those of\nJayachandran et al. (2003) and Provan et al. (2004) which\nalso show a large-scale reaction in the flows over the\u223c10\u201320\nmins following substorm onset. What is clear from this study,\nhowever, is the addition to these flows of other large-scale\nflow features, which have previously only been discussed in-\ndividually.\nFor example, the development of the Harang Discontinu-\nity, which is a region of equatorward electric field extending\ninto the post-midnight sector, is also evident in Fig. 4. One\nresult of the Harang which can clearly be seen, for example,\nin Fig. 4h is the reversal of the dusk cell flow at a lower lat-\nitude than that of the dawn cell. Of course, the flow pattern\nis complicated further by smaller-scale perturbations which\nare imposed by localised changes in the conductivity, how-\never, these are discussed in more detail below. The larger-\nscale, azimuthally extended, Harang flows may actually cor-\nrespond to the true form of the Kamide et al. (1994) equa-\ntorward substorm convection cell as postulated by Liang et\nal. (2006). In this case, however, these flows also appear to be\nintrinsically related to the enhanced auroral and sub-auroral\nflows described earlier. These are themselves likely to con-\ntain the return flow associated with Dungey cycle convec-\ntion, but also contain structure driven by polarisation fields\nin the inner magnetosphere, such as the auroral westward\nflow channels (AWFCs) discussed, for example, by Parkin-\nson et al. (2003, 2005a, b). Interestingly, the Harang and\nFig. 5. Two scans of line-of-sight velocity data from the north-\nern hemisphere King Salmon radar, which is conjugate to TIGER\nUnwin (see Fig. 1). This data is shown in the same format as the\nleft-hand panels of Fig. 4, and again has the southern hemisphere\nvectors and potential contours superposed, for comparison with the\nnorthern hemisphere data.\nsub-auroral flows persisted for over an hour into the recovery\nphase of the substorm described here, well after the major\nauroral signatures of the substorm had subsided. This sup-\nports the notion that they must be a response to something\nin addition to the substorm current system which will have\ndominated during the expansion phase.\nAnother facet of the flows described here relates to their\nconjugacy. Whilst the asymmetries mentioned above have\nbeen observed before during substorms, other asymmetries\ncan exist, such as those introduced by a significant IMF By\ncomponent, which could be present here. In this case,\nIMF By fluctuates between \u00b16 nT over the course of the in-\nterval (as evidenced in the ACE data, not shown), making\nany inference of a By-related asymmetry difficult to make.\nHowever, previous studies of the effect of IMF By on night-\nside ionospheric flows have revealed an opposite asymme-\ntry between the northern and southern hemispheres (Grocott\net al., 2005), which is something that is not observed here.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows two scans from the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/ Ann.

Four selected maps of field-aligned current density (left-hand panel) and corresponding auroral images (right-hand panel). The pattern\nof FAC is implied by the curl of the velocity field (derived from the electric potential) and has been determined using the technique described\nby McWilliams et al. (2001). Positive vorticities (red\/yellow) indicate upward field aligned current, and negative vorticities (blue) downward\nfield aligned current.\nnorthern hemisphere King Salmon radar, which is conjugate\nto TIGER Unwin (see Fig. 1). This data is shown in the same\nformat as the left-hand panels of Fig. 4, and again has the\nsouthern hemisphere vectors and potential contours super-\nposed, for comparison with the northern hemisphere data.\nThe northern hemisphere flows, indicated by the coloured\npatches, are clearly consistent with those in the southern\nhemisphere with fast equatorward flows emanating from the\npolar cap followed by fast, westward, sunward flows at lower\nlatitudes. This is consistent with an interhemispheric study\nof sub-auroral polarisation streams conducted by Parkinson\net al. (2005) who also found a long-time scale magnetic con-\njugacy in the AWFC activity.\nOne final aspect of the large-scale electrodynamics which\nshould be considered is that of the associated field-aligned\ncurrent system. In an attempt to visualise the pattern of\nFAC during this interval, the curl of the velocity field (de-\nrived from the electric potential) has been determined using\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3365\u20133381, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/\nA. Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics 3377\nthe technique described by McWilliams et al. (2001) (after\nFreeman et al., 1990; Sofko et al., 1995). This is illustrated\nin Fig. 6, which shows the vorticity of the flow at four se-\nlected times, alongside the corresponding auroral map. Here,\npositive vorticities (red\/yellow) correspond to upward field\naligned current, and negative vorticities (blue) to downward\nfield aligned current. Of course, the vorticity is not a direct\nindication of the FAC, the latter also being dependent on gra-\ndients in the conductivity. In particular, the meso-scale dis-\ntribution of FAC has been shown to be strongly dominated\nby conductivity gradients (e.g. Amm et al., 2005). With that\nin mind, however, the clear agreement between auroral en-\nhancements and changes in the vorticity is quite remarkable\nand must strongly imply a relationship with the FAC. Look-\ning at panels (a) and (b), for example, the change in vorticity\nwhich occurs as a result of the main substorm intensifica-\ntion appears to be an enhanced region at the westward end\nof the substorm bulge. This implies a typical azimuthal sub-\nstorm current wedge (SCW) configuration with the substorm\nelectrojet flowing westwards along the poleward edge of the\nbulge. Comparing this to the situation later on in the interval\n(panels c\u2013d) suggests a significant change in the current pat-\ntern. There are still localised regions of enhanced vorticity\nassociated with the bright aurora (discussed further below),\nbut there is now an additional region at lower latitudes cor-\nresponding to the Harang, but not to any significant auroral\nenhancement. This may well be associated with a merid-\nional current system (MCS) of the kind described by Kamide\net al. (1994), for example, in their Fig. 7. Liang et al. (2006)\nsuggest that the MCS current system and associated eastward\nflows at auroral latitudes is a result of field line slippage (Lui\nand Kamide, 2003), whereas the SCW may be driven by re-\nconnection. This is certainly consistent with the sub-auroral\nlocation of the MCS vs. the auroral location of the SCW.\n4.2 The small-scale picture\nOne of the main problems in trying to describe a simple\nlarge-scale scenario for substorms, is the fact that they are\nintrinsically related to smaller-scale phenomena which serve\nto complicate their overall electrodynamics. When using HF\nradars to study substorms, for example, one of the most sig-\nnificant complicating factors is the variability in the charac-\nteristics of radar backscatter itself. Consider Fig. 4b, for ex-\nample, which shows a patch of enhanced scatter collocated\nwith the brightest aurora. According to Milan et al. (1999) in-\ntense, short lived, electron precipitation associated with auro-\nral arcs can give rise to radar backscatter. However, enhance-\nments to the ionospheric electron density which can also be\ncaused by auroral precipitation can also give rise to backscat-\nter bite-outs. In Fig. 4c, for example, there is evidence of\na region devoid of scatter just equatorward of the enhanced\nflow region. This loss of scatter is something which is also\noften seen in association with substorm expansion phases and\nis understood to be related to enhanced refraction of the HF\nradio signal, or by absorption of the signal by enhanced elec-\ntron densities in the bulge (Gauld et al., 2002). It is not diffi-\ncult to see how, in cases where this drop out of data is signif-\nicant, the lack of any observations of flow excitation can be\nmisinterpreted as evidence for the absence of such flow.\nNot all auroral arcs that do produce backscatter are asso-\nciated with enhanced flows. Indeed, in some cases the high\nconductivities present in bright auroras can inhibit the elec-\ntric field, resulting is regions of stagnant flow. Fig. 4f, for\nexample, shows a typical \u201czone of avoidance\u201d in which sub-\nstorm flows are diverted around a region of high conductivity.\nIt is worth stressing at this point that no information from\nthe auroral data is used in generating the potential patterns\nfrom SuperDARN, which are therefore clearly in remark-\nable agreement. There is some distinction, however, between\nthe intense, short lived, auroral forms which can give rise to\nintense electric fields and those in which the electric field\nis reduced. A localised flow suppression region, however,\nshould also not be interpreted as evidence that substorms do\nnot excite flow. To the west of the flow suppression region\nin Fig. 4f, for example, there is still a significant zone of\nfast equatorward flow which forms part of a larger-scale flow\nsystem that is largely unchanged from that of Fig. 4e. The\nsmaller-scale electrodynamics can therefore serve to compli-\ncate the geometry of the larger-scale picture but generally\nappear to act in addition to, rather than instead of, the more\nglobal-scale convection dynamics.\nThe variability in the location and size of these fast flow re-\ngions does, however, raise an interesting question pertaining\nto the origin of the flows. It was noted above in reference to\nFig. 3 that there are transients which propagate equatorward\nfrom the polar cap into the auroral zone. These have strong\nanalogues to similar flows observed on the dayside such as\npoleward moving radar auroral forms (PMRAFs) which have\nbeen shown to be the ionospheric flow signature of dayside\nreconnection (Milan et al., 2000; Wild et al., 2001). Perhaps\nthese equatorward moving radar auroral forms, or EMRAFs,\nare the counterpart ionospheric flow signature of nightside\nreconnection? For instance, de la Beaujardie`re et al. (1994)\nreported the occurrence of bursts of equatorward-directed\nflow in nightside Sondrestrom radar data which took place\nduring a \u201cquiet-time\u201d interval in which the transverse com-\nponents of the IMF were small and directed mainly north-\nward. These bursts were initiated near the nightside open-\nclosed field line boundary and had amplitudes up to several\n100 m s\u22121. Simultaneous auroral data showed that each flow\npulse was accompanied by a poleward boundary intensifi-\ncation (PBI) (Lyons et al., 1999), similar to at least one of\nthe EMRAFs observed here. This is illustrated in Fig. 6c,\nwhich also reveals the kinked convection signature and as-\nsociated pattern of field-aligned currents at \u223c70\u25e63. Lester\net al. (2001) also reported radar signatures of nightside re-\nconnection at the polar cap boundary, in this case taking\nthe form of narrow bands of large spectral width, which oc-\ncurred during an interval of weak solar wind forcing. That\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3365\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3365\u20133381, 2006\n3378 A. Grocott et al.: Towards a synthesis of substorm electrodynamics\nsuch similar phenomenology can occur under such different\ngeophysical conditions implies that the same underlying re-\nconnection processes are involved whether during a substorm\nexpansion phase or during extended intervals of geomagnetic\nquiet.\nPoleward boundary intensifications are not the only\nmesoscale auroral feature which are associated with recon-\nnection and flow excitation. Indeed, PBIs themselves are of-\nten observed to \u201ceject\u201d one or more north-south aligned auro-\nral forms, or streamers, towards lower latitudes (Henderson\net al., 1998) and these have been associated with the earth-\nward transport of flux, specifically, bursty-bulk flows (BBFs)\nin the near-Earth plasma sheet. Presumably therefore, since\nthey originate from the poleward most arc, these are the sig-\nnatures of reconnection. However, during substorm growth\nphases, BBFs have also been observed coincident with pseu-\ndobreakups (e.g. Grocott et al., 2004). Traditionally, a pseu-\ndobreakup is described as a substorm which never progresses\nto a full expansion phase. If substorm reconnection begins\non closed field lines, with a full expansion phase onset be-\nginning only when the reconnection reaches open flux, then\na pseudobreakup must presumably also involve only closed\nfield lines. This is contrary to some studies such as those\nby Grocott et al. (2004) and Hubert et al. (2006), however,\nwhich suggest that pseudobreakups are associated with sig-\nnificant closure of open flux. This discrepancy in our un-\nderstanding of such phenomena is something which must be\nresolved.\n5 Summary\nIn this paper we have discussed an interval of substorm ac-\ntivity during which the disturbed region was well observed\nby the FUV instrument on board the IMAGE spacecraft and\nby the TIGER pair of HF radars. This has enabled the spa-\ntial and temporal development of many different elements\nof the substorm process to be resolved including the large-\nscale excitation of equatorward flow out of the polar cap af-\nter substorm onset, the occurrence of transient flow features\nand their relationship to auroral brightenings, the morphol-\nogy of the substorm current wedge and Harang discontinuity,\nand the development of sub-auroral flows. Specifically, this\nstudy has revealed the following:\n(a) Small-scale electrodynamics such as localised activa-\ntions of the aurora, transient flow enhancements and\nregions of flow suppression can be reconciled with the\nmore global-scale evolution of the substorm, whilst re-\nvealing much about the complex interplay between the\nelectric fields and aurora.\n(b) \u201cEquatorward moving radar auroral forms\u201d (EMRAFS)\npropagate across the open-closed field line boundary as\na likely HF radar signature of nightside reconnection.\nThese are analogous to similar features on the dayside\nthat have been successfully used to quantify reconnec-\ntion.\n(c) Simultaneous observations of the development of large-\nscale dynamical systems such as the Harang Disconti-\nnuity and the sub-auroral flow channels have enabled\nthem to be placed within a simple conceptual frame-\nwork of magnetospheric convection. This helps to rec-\noncile observations of localised substorm current sys-\ntems such as the Kamide et al. (1994) \u2018equatorward sub-\nstorm convection cell\u2019 with observations of global-scale\nintensifications associated with convection and polari-\nsation fields in the inner magnetosphere.\n(d) A remarkable agreement between the vorticity of iono-\nspheric flow and auroral morphology supports the ex-\nistence of a number of distinct substorm current sys-\ntems including the traditional substorm current wedge,\nthe Kamide et al. (1994) meridional current system,\nthe nightside component of the DP-2 current system,\nthe more equatorward currents associated with polarisa-\ntion electric fields and other, localised, regions of field-\naligned-current.\nAdditional, multi-scale studies, are obviously warranted be-\nfore a complete synthesis of substorm electrodynamics can\nbe claimed. These will no doubt come from future investiga-\ntions of substorm plasma sheet dynamics using THEMIS and\nits associated ground based observatories, combined with ob-\nservations of the auroral and sub-auroral ionosphere from Su-\nperDARN and StormDARN. The present study, in addition\nto providing a detailed overview of our current understand-\ning, has defined a detailed framework within which these new\ndata can be interpreted.\nAcknowledgements.
