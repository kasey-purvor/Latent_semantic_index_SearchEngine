R. Edwards* and C. Deal\nSmall scale explosions, using a detonator, of 7075 aluminium alloy cylinders, 15\u2013100 mm outside\ndiameter, were carried out to investigate the effects of heat treatment on fragmentation. This was\nthe finest for the strongest as received alloy and coarsest for the softest overaged alloy. This\neffect was similar to that seen in investigations of the fragmentation of steel. Cylinders of 50 and\n100 mm in diameter did not fragment but plastically deformed with maximum deformation at the\ncylinder bottom. Fragmentation of 33 and 42 mm diameter cylinders produced long fragments\ntypical of the break-up of thick walled cylinders. At smaller diameters, break-up gave fragments of\nseveral shapes, finer fragments being largely associated with the smallest diameter cylinders and\nthe highest strength alloys. Results followed those seen in large scale studies of cylinder break-up\nand suggest the possibility of using small scale fragmentation experiments in the investigation of\nthe effects of composition, heat treatment and processing on natural fragmentation.\nKeywords: Fragmentation, Aluminium alloy, Heat treatment\nList of symbols\nc acoustic velocity\nKf fragmentation toughness\nP2 constant in stress\u2013strain curve P5P1z\nP2ln(1ze)\nr radius of ring bomb at break-up\nS fragment characteristic length\nV velocity of ring bomb at break-up\nxmean mean length of fragment\n:\ne strain rate\neF true fracture strain\nr density\nsF true fracture stress\nIntroduction\nFragmentation has been most often studied in the\ncontext of bombs or shells where the mass of explosive\ncharge: mass of metal ratio (C\/M) is large in order to\nmaximise the initial fragment velocity.1 It will be of\ninterest to study the fragmentation process for a wider\nrange of values of C\/M to investigate how this is affected\nby both the C\/M ratio and the mechanical properties of\nthe alloy. Recent work2\u20134 has emphasised that material\nbehaviour at high rates of strain involves phenomena,\nsuch as dynamic twinning, ductile to brittle transforma-\ntions and spalling, which make the modelling of\nphenomena more difficult with measurements and\ncalculations becoming more difficult as the strain rate\nincreases.\nMott5 studied the fragmentation of thin walled ring\nbombs, thus being able to characterise the fragments in\nterms of their average length. He found that the average\nlength was given by\nxmean~asF\n1zeF\nr P2\n\u0001 \u00021=2\nr\nV\n(1)\nThis shows that small fragments were associated with\nlow true strains to fracture and high workhardening\nrates, properties which can be modified by changes of\nalloy composition or heat treatment. Additionally a high\nradial velocity (fragment velocity) at the point of frac-\nture, controlled, as determined by Gurney,1 by the\nnature of the explosive and the C\/M ratio, will produce\nsmall fragments. Thus, shells that are designed to pro-\nduce smaller fragments will tend to be manufactured\nfrom steels of higher carbon content than shells that\nproduce larger fragments.\nAnother approach, due to Grady and Olson,6,7 con-\nsidered an energy balance during fragmentation and set\nthe fragment characteristic length as\nS~\n24Kf\u00f0 \u00de1=2\nrc\n:\ne\n\" #2=3\n(2)\nHere small fragments are associated with low values of\nfragmentation toughness, which, as a first approxima-\ntion, can be regarded as associated with materials of low\nfracture toughness. This is often consistent with the\npredictions of Mott, since materials with low fracture\nstrains are likely to have low fracture toughnesses.\nIn natural fragmentation, there is a wide range of\nfragment sizes.

The largest fragments tended to\nhave both outer and inner surfaces present, while the\nsmallest would have neither cylinder surface present.\nThus, the distribution of fragment sizes would be a\ncomposite of up to four separate distributions, corre-\nsponding to the four types of fragment. This concept of\nfragment type helps to explain the Grady and Kipp\u2019s9,10\nconcept of statistically inhomogeneous fragmentation.\nStudies11 of the fracturing of thick walled annealed\nAISI 1020 steel cylinders by the RDX based explosive C3\nshow that fracture did not occur at C\/M of 0?0025, while\nfor 0?067>C\/M>0?006, fracture occurred. In all cases, the\nfragments were long, extending over the length of the\ncylinder. For the case where fracture did not occur, there\nwas evidence of plastic deformation, shown by enlarge-\nment of the central hole. Additionally, fractures were pre-\nsent within the walls of the tube, but these did not connect\nwith the outer or inner surfaces of the tube. The number of\nfractures was estimated12 to be proportional to the particle\nvelocity and inversely proportional to the material critical\nimpact velocity. This implies that increasing the strength of\nan alloy by heat treatment will reduce the critical impact\nvelocity and therefore increase the number of fractures.\nAdditionally, increasing the C\/M ratio by decreasing the\nexternal diameter should increase the particle velocity and\ntherefore increase the number of fractures.\nFragmentation trials tend to be expensive when\ncarried out at full scale. It is of interest to investigate\nthe process where the amount of explosive is very small\nsince it may be then be possible to carry out the trial in a\nsimple container. Work carried out using the cartridge\ntest13\u201315 has aimed to use a measure of the damage\ncreated in a cartridge case as a method of determining\nthe explosive power of compounds, principally those\nseen in improvised explosives.\nWalsh16 showed in a trial of cylinders packed with\nexplosive that both the number of fragments and their\naverage mass increased at constant C\/M ratio as the wall\nthickness increased. This effect was more marked for\ntool steel than for an annealed medium carbon steel and\nappeared to be associated with a decreased proportion\nof fragments containing outside and inside surfaces of\nthe shell (type 1 according to the taxonomy of Mock and\nHolt). He also showed that for a constant wall thickness,\nthe increase in the average fragment mass with increas-\ning C\/M ratio is relatively small. All of these experiments\nwere carried out with C\/M ratios of 0?14\u20130?56. Since\nsteel is the customary material for shells and bombs,\nmost studies of heat treatment effects on fragmentation\nhave been carried out on steel samples. However, safety\nanalyses of aluminium alloy components containing\nenergetic materials will involve the evaluation of likely\nfragmentation of the aluminium alloy. The aim of the\npresent work is to look at the fragmentation behaviour\nas a function of the C\/M ratio and how this is affected\nby the heat treatment of the aluminium alloy.\nMaterials and methods\nMaterials used\nThe alloy was the Al\u2013Zn\u2013Mg\u2013Cu alloy 7075 with a\nnominal composition of Al\u20135?6Zn\u20132?5Mg\u20131?6Cu.\nThe heat treatments were:\n(i) AR: as received, solution treated and peak aged\n(T6 temper)\n(ii) ST: solution treated for 2 h at 480uC, water\nquenched\n(iii) OA: overaged, solution treated for 2 h at 480uC,\nwater quenched and aged for 48 h at 200uC.\nHardness testing was carried out using an Indentec hard-\nness testing machine HWDM-7 with a 300 g load. Ten\nmeasurements were made on each sample and results are\nshown in Table 1. The measurements were taken from the\noutside edge to inside hole at the ends of the samples.\nTensile testing was carried out on samples with a\ndiameter of 4?53 mm and a gauge length of 16 mm.\nCrosshead speed was 2 mm min21, corresponding to a\nnominal strain rate of 261023 s21. Average results for\nsamples taken from the 25 mm diameter bars are in\nTable 2 and for samples taken from the 100 mm bar in\nTable 3. In all cases, three specimens were taken for each\nheat treatment condition.\nExperimental methods\nThe specimens were in the form of cylinders of 15\u2013100 mm\noutside diameter with a 6?5 mm diameter hole in the\ncentre. The length of the cylinders was 35 mm, which cor-\nresponded to the length of the explosive in the detonators\nused. The C\/M ratios for the experiments are listed in\nTable 4, assuming a charge mass of 1?05 g and ignoring\nthe mass of the thin aluminium tube of the detonator.\nThe explosive charge was a single electrical L2A1\ndetonator which consists of a tube, a main filling, a\nprimary charge and a fuzehead assembly. A diagram of\nthe detonator can be seen at Fig. 1.\nThe tube is manufactured from aluminium, 61 mm\nlong and 6?5 mm in diameter. It is closed at one end and\ncontains the main filling, the primary charge and the\nfuzehead assembly. The main filling is made up of 1?05 g\nCE (tetryl) which is in the form of one granulated pellet\nwith a nominal mass of 0?3 g and three pressed pellets\nMaterials Science and Technology mst9136.3d 17\/9\/09 20:33:46\nThe Charlesworth Group, Wakefield +44(0)1924 369598 - Rev 7.51n\/W (Jan 20 2003)\nTable 1 Hardness test results\nCylinder diameter,\nmm\nHardness, HV0.3\nAs received\nSolution\ntreated Overaged\n25 202\u00a112 160\u00a15 109\u00a16\n100 191\u00a19 142\u00a17 107\u00a16\nTable 2 Tensile test results (25 mm diameter cylinders)\n25AR 25ST 25OA\nTensile strength, MPa 578\u00a112 551\u00a122 343\u00a11.4\nYield strength, MPa 519\u00a113 401\u00a115 274\u00a141\nTrue fracture strength, MPa 623\u00a127 610\u00a145 356\u00a113\nElongation, % 16\u00a10.9 16\u00a11.4 23\u00a10.9\nReduction in area, % 8\u00a12.4 10\u00a11.8 30\u00a10.0\nTrue fracture strain 0.08\u00a10.03 0.11\u00a10.02 0.36\u00a10.0\nTable 3 Tensile test results (100 mm diameter cylinders)\n100AR 100ST 100OA\nTensile strength, MPa 592\u00a143 582\u00a17 368\u00a12\nYield strength, MPa 524\u00a142 399\u00a16 268\u00a11\nTrue fracture strength, MPa 626\u00a194 661\u00a110 302\u00a126\nElongation, % 19\u00a11.0 21\u00a11.7 25\u00a10.0\nReduction in area, % 10\u00a11.5 11\u00a11.7 30\u00a10.0\nTrue fracture strain 0.11\u00a10.01 0.12\u00a10.02 0.36\u00a10.0\nEdwards and Deal Effect of heat treatment on fragmentation of Al alloy ;\n2 Materials Science and Technology 2009 VOL 000 NO 000\neach with a nominal mass of 0?25 g. The primary charge\nwhich tops the main charge consists of composition ASA\nwith a nominal mass of 0?35 g. The detonator is initiated\nelectrically. CE (C7H5N5O8) has a detonation velocity of\n7570 m s21 for a density of 1710 kg m23.17 The nominal\ndensity of tetryl pellets is 1590 kg m23, indicating a pro-\nbable detonation velocity of slightly less than 7570 m s21.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 1 that the part of the\ndetonator containing the main filling is 35 mm in length.\nThis determines the length of the sample cylinders.\nEach experiment was conducted inside a bucket\n(Fig. 2) in order to contain any fragments generated.\nThe cylinder was then placed in the tube of cardboard\nand the detonator was pushed into the hole in the middle\nof the cylinder. A second sheet of cardboard was then\nplaced over the top of the cardboard tube and the\nremainder of the bucket was filled with sand. The lid was\nthen placed on the bucket and was weighted down with a\nsandbag. The detonator wires trailed from underneath\nthe lid and were connected to an initiating device.\nOn initial inspection, the bucket remained intact and\nall fragments were captured within the sand. In each\ncase, the sand was sifted to find all the fragments, and\nthis was verified by first cleaning the fragments of sand\nand embedded cardboard, and then comparing the mass\nof the fragments retrieved with the original unexploded\nmass of each block.\nResults\nVisual examination\nThe fragments from the 15\u201342 mm diameter cylinders\ncan be seen in Fig. 3. Visually, as the cylinder size\ndecreases, the fragments get smaller and, for constant\ncylinder diameter, as the alloy gets softer, the fragments\nget larger. At larger diameters (Fig. 3a\u2013f), the fragments\nare the length of the original cylinder, while at smaller\ndiameters, the fragments get shorter and more of them\nbecome essentially equiaxed in form.\nWhen the larger cylinders were examined, it was seen\nthat the 50 mm as received sample was on the verge of\nfragmenting into three fragments with fractures parallel\nto the cylinder axis as shown in Fig. 4.\nThere was enlargement of the central hole, initially\n6?5 mm diameter, as seen in Fig. 5. This enlargement\n(Table 5) was more marked at the bottom of the cylinder\nthan at the top, greater for the softer alloy tempers and\nsomewhat greater for the 50 mm diameter than for the\n100 mm diameter cylinders.\nFor the other large cylinders, it was noted that there\nwas some spalling at the base of the cylinder.\nFragment masses\nThe numbers and masses of the individual fragments\nwere determined for the cylinders (15\u201342 mm diameter)\nthat fragmented. The recovery of fragments was close to\n100%, although some of the finer fragments produced in\nthe 15 and 20 mm cylinders were not recovered as can be\nseen in Table 6. Figure 6 confirms the conclusions of the\nvisual examination that the fragmentation gets finer with\ndecreasing cylinder diameter (lower M\/C) and coarser as\nthe alloy becomes softer.\nThe cumulative numbers of fragments heavier than a\ngiven mass M are given in Table 7 for the cylinders (15\u2013\n42 mm diameter) that fragmented.\nSome of the data of Table 7 are presented as a\nfunction of cylinder diameter (heat treatment constant)\nin Fig. 7 and as a function of heat treatment (cylinder\ndiameter constant) in Fig. 8.\nDiscussion of results\nWhen the effect of varying the C\/M ratio is considered,\nit is useful to divide the fragmentation into three distinct\nMaterials Science and Technology mst9136.3d 17\/9\/09 20:33:47\nThe Charlesworth Group, Wakefield +44(0)1924 369598 - Rev 7.51n\/W (Jan 20 2003)\nTable 4 Charge: metal (C\/M) ratios for cylinders\nDiameter, mm C\/M (M\/C)\n15 0.0752 (13.3)\n20 0.0382 (26.2)\n25 0.0231 (43.3)\n33 0.0130 (76.9)\n42 0.0079 (126.0)\n50 0.0055 (182.0)\n100 0.0014 (730.0)\n1 L2A1 detonator\n2 Experimental arrangement of cylinder in sand bucket\nTable 5 Hole diameter increase in 50 and 100 mm\ndiameter samples\nSample\nTop hole diameter,\nmm\nBottom hole diameter,\nmm\n100AR 6.66 10.52\n100ST 6.53 12.16\n100OA 6.52 15.66\n50AR 7.78 12.34\n50ST 6.62 13.6\n50OA 6.9 15.7\nEdwards and Deal Effect of heat treatment on fragmentation of Al alloy ;\nMaterials Science and Technology 2009 VOL 000 NO 000 3\nregimes.

Since the velocity of crack propagation is less\nthan the Rayleigh wave velocity,21,22 this is sub-\nstantially slower than the detonation velocity of the\nexplosive in the detonator, and therefore, cracking and\nfragmentation will start along the length of the cylinder\nas the detonation wave passes along the cylinder length.\nThe fragments are likely to be of different shapes, as is\nseen in Fig. 3g\u2013o and confirmed, following Mock and\nHolt,8 by the bilinear cumulative fragment distributions\nof Figs. 7 and 8. The number of fragments produced\nincreased as the C\/M ratio increased, as shown in Fig. 6\nfor all heat treatment conditions and for both the\npatterns of fragmentation seen in Fig. 3. For the thin\nwalled cylinders, this would be as predicted by\nequations (1) and (2), since the velocity at break-up in\nequation (1) will increase with C\/M as will the strain rate\nin equation (2). In the case of thick walled cylinders, the\nparticle velocity increases with C\/M, thus increasing the\nnumber of fragments when the external diameter\nchanges from 42 to 33 mm.\nFragmentation is known to be affected by the\nmechanical properties of the metal. Equations (1) and\n(2) for the fragmentation of thin walled cylinders predict\nthat the more ductile overaged samples should produce\nfewer fragments at a given C\/M ratio than would the\nstronger as received (peak aged) samples. This is shown\nin Table 6. Results for the solution treated samples\nshould produce an intermediate number of fragments\nwhich they do. It is of interest to look at equations (1)\nand (2) more quantitatively. The assumption5 made in\nequation (1) is that the cylinder is in the form of a ring\nbomb, which has a uniform length in the z direction, and\nthat all fractures producing fragments are in the radial\ndirection with fragments containing both inner and\nouter cylinder walls (type 1 in the taxonomy of Mock\nand Holt8). Since the fragments created are of varying\nmorphologies, quantitative analysis would not be\nparticularly helpful. In contrast, it is possible to make\nsome estimate of the effect of changing mechanical\nproperties on equation (2). If it is assumed that the mass\nof a fragment is proportional to S3, then equation (2)\ncan be rewritten as\nS~aKf (3)\n<Using estimates of plane strain fracture toughness of\n25 MPa m1\/2 for 7075-T623 and 50 MPa m1\/2 for the\noveraged sample,24 assuming a yield strength of\n275 MPa would indicate that the average fragment\nmass should be increased by a factor of 2 when going\nfrom the strongest AR to the weakest OA condition.\nResults from Table 6 give factors of .2?8, .3?0 and\n.1?8 for diameters of 15, 20 and 25 mm, considering all\nfragments.

It is still\nimportant to accept that there will be a large variation in\nfragment sizes, as seen in Table 7, and that fragment\ndistributions will be important in determining the effec-\ntiveness of any fragmentation. Considering the fracture\nof thick walled cylinders (33 and 42 mm outside\ndiameters), the number of fragments produced is the\ngreatest for the cylinders in the as received condition and\nthe smallest for those that had been overaged. Indeed, in\nthe as received condition, the onset of fragmentation can\nbe seen for the 50 mm diameter cylinders (Fig. 4),\nsomething not seen for the 50 mm diameter cylinders in\nthe other heat treatment conditions. Since the critical\nimpact velocity tends to decrease with increasing alloy\nhardness,25 an increase in number of fragments (Fig. 6)\nseen in the as received condition would be expected and\nalso with the solution treated alloy producing more frag-\nments than the overaged. For the thin walled cylinders,\nthe fragmentation in the as received condition is finer\nboth measured by the total number of fragments and the\nmass of the largest fragment (Table 7 and Fig. 8). Again\nthe coarsest fragmentation is that seen in the overaged\nsamples, even though the pattern of fragmentation is\ndifferent from that seen in the thick cylinders of 33 and\n42 mm diameters.\nTaylor18 has estimated the shape of a cylinder\ndetonated at one end and showed that the diameter of\nthe central hole increases with distance from the\ninitiation point and will be greater for higher values of\nC\/M. The results of Table 5 confirm this for this work\nwith hole diameters greater for the 50 mm diameter\ncylinders and the bottom hole diameter greater than the\ntop hole diameter. Hole enlargement at constant C\/M is\nthe greatest for the softest overaged material and the\nleast for the strongest peak aged material. This would be\nas expected as the strain to fracture will be the greatest\nfor the alloy in its softest condition.\nConclusions\n1. The small scale testing, by the use of varying C\/M\nratios, can produce patterns of fragmentation similar to\nthat seen in the large scale testing of cylinders packed\nwith military explosives.\n2. The fineness of fragmentation increases when the\naluminium alloy is in the highest strength (peak aged)\ncondition and decreases when the alloy is in its lowest\nstrength (overaged) condition. This applies for both thin\nand thick walled cylinders.\n3. There is an increase in the fineness of fragmenta-\ntion seen when the C\/M ratios of both thick and thin\nwalled cylinders are increased.\n4. For thin walled cylinders, there are varying shapes\nof fragment, indicating that fracture occurs by more\nthan one mechanism.\n5. The enlargement of the central hole in non-\nfragmenting specimens is the greatest for the highest\nC\/M cylinders and for constant C\/M, the highest for the\nsoftest overaged specimens.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors wish to thank their Cranfield colleagues\nA.
