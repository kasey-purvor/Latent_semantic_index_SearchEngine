Introduction1\nCombustion of biomass rich waste derived fuels is currently being promoted worldwide, as2\nthe use of such fuels in energy intensive industries can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions3\nand can be economical for energy users. The biomass fraction of such fuels is considered \u2018carbon4\nneutral\u2019 and thus these may also bring incentives in the form of renewable energy for end users. The5\nEU Landfill Directive (Council of the European Union, 1999) offers further incentive by prescribing6\ntargets to member states for diverting biodegradable municipal solid waste (MSW) from landfill.7\nFailure to achieve these targets may incur a heavy financial penalty on the local authorities (LAs)8\nwho fail to meet their own targets set by national government. In the context of the UK, the situation9\nis particularly challenging due to the heavy reliance on landfilling in the past. The most recent data10\nsuggest that England still landfilled 54.4% of the total MSW in 2007-08 (Defra, 2008), which is11\n15.5 million tonnes (Defra, 2008).12\nIn recent years, several combustion studies have been performed using unsorted or pre-13\ntreated MSW (Chang et al., 1998; Ferrer et al., 2005; Garg et al., 2007b; Guo et al., 2001; Kobyashi14\net al., 2005; Kouvo and Backman, 2003; Piao et al., 2000; Piao et al., 1998). However, there are still15\nconcerns surrounding the heterogeneity of waste material, calorific value (CV) and heavy metal16\nemissions. To overcome this ambiguous situation regarding fuel quality, the European Commission17\nhas given mandate to CEN Technical Committee CEN\/TC 343 \u201cSolid Recovered Fuels\u201d to prepare18\na document classifying solid recovered fuels (SRF) (European Committee for Standardisation,19\n2006). Recently, SRF co-combustion studies have been performed in a pulverised fuel-fired20\ncombustion reactor to observe the fate of mercury and chlorine (Hilber et al., 2007b). Two different21\nqualities of SRF complying with CEN standards were being used as co-fuel. One of these was22\nderived from the high calorific fractions of MSW and the resulting SRF was mixed with commercial23\nwaste (25%) to prepare the other SRF. Addition of commercial waste reduces the quantity of24\n4chlorine in the resulting product. It was found that chlorine concentrations in the flue gas stream1\nrises with increase in SRF share. However, use of SRF did not change total mercury content2\nsignificantly. Gaseous elemental mercury was found to be reduced behind the filter, whereas the3\nHgCl2 concentration increased behind the filter. In another study, Hilber et al. (Hilber et al., 2007a)4\nalso developed a method to characterise the de-volatilisation process of SRF meeting CEN5\nrequirements.6\nIn order to prepare a fuel complying with CEN standards, residual or mixed MSW can be7\ntreated using mechanical biological treatment (MBT) or extensive mechanical treatment (MT)8\nprocess. MSW derived fuel is known as solid recovered fuel (SRF) or refuse derived fuel (RDF)9\ndepending upon the composition and characteristics of fuel. SRF is considered more homogeneous10\nand less contaminated fuel, and is market-driven due to tighter quality specifications, whereas RDF11\nhas an input-driven specification (Juniper Consultancy Services Ltd, 2005). The present study was12\nundertaken to compare the heavy metal emissions resulting from the co-combustion of synthetic13\nSRF and real RDF (derived from MSW) with coal.14\nMBT is a method for treating residual or mixed MSW and in some parts of Europe it is15\nrelatively widespread, e.g. Germany, Italy and Austria (Steiner, 2005). In MBT processes, a series16\nof biological and mechanical treatment unit operations are employed to separate out recyclables,17\ncompost, biogas and fuel. MSW derived SRF or RDF has paper, plastic, textile and wood as their18\nmain constituents. The Ecodeco process (Ecodeco, 2010) is an example of a commercially available19\nMBT process producing SRF, which is currently operating in the UK in East London, England and20\nDumfries and Galloway, Scotland. This process employs a bio-drying method for partial21\nstabilisation of untreated MSW (Friends of the Earth, 2008). The bio-drying process reduces the22\nmoisture in the waste, thus making mechanical separation more efficient. SRF has the potential use23\nas co-fuel in cement kilns, power plants and dedicated incineration facilities (Garg et al., 2009; Garg24\n5et al., 2007a). However, it is necessary to address the emissions from the co-combustion of this1\nmaterial prior to adoption in the UK, as limited information is available in the open literature.2\nThe aim of this study was to produce synthetic SRF in the laboratory by grinding paper,3\nplastic, wood and textile and perform co-combustion studies with coal in a fluidized bed combustor.4\nThe heavy metal emissions obtained from SRF co-combustion studies were compared with those5\nfrom coal and coal + RDF mixture combustion studies. The MSW derived SRF and RDF proportion6\nin the final fuel mixture was kept at 10% (w\/w) as, in practice, the supply of SRF or RDF could not7\neasily exceed 10% of total fuel for coal-fired power stations. The distribution of trace elements in8\nthe ash components and flue gas stream was also calculated. The thermal behaviour of the paper,9\nplastic and coal was investigated in the presence and absence of oxygen using thermo-gravimetric10\nanalysis (TGA).11\n12\n2. Experimental13\n14\n2.1. Fluidized bed combustor15\nThe combustion of the fuel or fuel blends was carried out in a 50 kW capacity pilot scale16\nfluidised bed combustor test facility located in the Centre for Energy and Resource Technology17\n(CERT) at Cranfield University, UK (Figure 1).18\nThe fuel was fed continuously into the combustor through a hopper via a drop tube above the19\nsurface of fluidized silica sand bed. The combustion was controlled by adjustments to the fuel feed20\nrate and the preheated air flow rate. The flue gas passed into a second (refractory lined) chamber21\nthen through a water-cooled heat exchanger assembly. The resulting gas stream was then entered22\ninto the cyclone separator, where fly ash was separated from flue gas. After the cyclone, flue gas23\nwas sent to an extraction fan before release to atmosphere via a stack. The combustor was operated24\n6at below atmospheric pressure to prevent the release of gases into the combustion hall. The1\ncombustor was equipped with bottom and fly ash removal devices and thermocouples were installed2\nto measure the fluidised bed temperature at the top of the combustion zone and pre-heater. Fly ash3\nsamples were collected from the fly ash silo located under the cyclone assembly. The CO4\nconcentration was kept as low as possible (near to zero) to achieve optimum combustion.5\nThe fluidised bed combustor was used for relatively short periods with solid fuels allowing a6\nsufficient steady state period; therefore no extraction of bed material was necessary during its7\noperation. The bed was emptied only when cool after an operational run and replaced with fresh8\nsand before the next experimental run.9\n10\n2.2. Sampling, measurement and analytical methods11\nGas sampler ports were provided in the combustor for sampling. One port was used for12\nonline CO and CO2 monitoring of the flue gases, while the other one was used for trace metal13\nsampling. The air flow rate was measured by means of rotameters and this was kept at ca. 140014\nl\/min. The flue gas samples for metal analysis were collected by three bubbling traps immersed in a15\ncold bath. The first two traps contained 10% nitric acid to dissolve the metals into solution and the16\nthird one was a guard of water to protect the pump from the acid. The metals measured in the flue17\ngas samples include Cr, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Al, Mn, Cd and Co. Measurements of18\nmetal concentrations were made using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) (Hitachi19\nZ8100 Polarized Zeeman Spectrophotometer).20\nBottom ash and fly ash samples were sent to a commercial testing agency (TES Bretby,21\nStaffordshire, UK) for the determination of heavy metals (including Hg).22\nTGA was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyser manufactured by CI Instruments23\nLtd. (ROBAL with a 5 gram head). Experimental runs were performed at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C\/24\n7min with a target temperature of 800 \u00b0C. Two types of experimental runs were undertaken; N2 was1\nused for pyrolysis volatilization and air used for the combustion runs. Gas flow rate in both was kept2\nat 20 ml\/min. A sample size of 200 mg was used for the experimental runs.3\n4\n2.3. Fuel samples5\nThe coal used for the combustion experiments was a bituminous coal from Daw Mill mine,6\nUK. For experimental purposes, the coal was sieved to provide a particle size between 5 and 13 mm.7\nSynthetic SRF was prepared by shredding and grinding paper, saw dust, polypropylene,8\npolyethylene, PVC, and textiles. The composition of synthetic SRF sample was similar to that9\nobtained from the Ecodeco process (Cozens, 2004) as this is a commercially operational facility .10\nThe synthetic fuel comprised 58% paper, 22% plastic, 15% textile and 5% wood by weight (w\/w).11\nPolypropylene (8% w\/w), polyethylene (12% w\/w) and PVC (2% w\/w) were used as representative12\nof plastics, whereas conifer saw dust was used for wood. Polypropylene and PVC were supplied by13\nAldrich, UK. Polyethylene was in the form of unused carrier bags obtained from a local14\nsupermarket. Junk mail and household sheets were used to represent paper and textile, respectively.15\nIn addition, 8% (w\/w) water was added to the dry mixture.16\nMSW derived RDF was obtained from a local mechanical treatment plant situated in Leicester, UK.17\nThe RDF comprised 82% paper and card, 13% plastic, 5% others (wood, textiles and miscellaneous18\ncombustibles). RDF was also shredded and homogenised in a blender prior to pelletization.19\nSRF and RDF were used in the form of pellets having a diameter of 18 mm and a length of20\n30 mm in the combustion runs. This was a constraint of the combustion rig.21\nSamples of coal, synthetic SRF components, SRF and RDF were sent to TES Bretby,22\nStaffordshire, UK for proximate, ultimate and ash analyses. Clean silica sand of grade 16\/30 (size23\n0.50 mm- 1.00 mm) (supplied by Garside sands, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, UK) was used as24\n8bed material during the combustion trials and was also sent to the same laboratory for the metal and1\noxide determination. The metals, including Silicon, were determined by solubilising the ash samples2\nby acid dissolution and analysis of the solution by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy.3\nThe measured content of metals is then reported in the form of their highest oxide. Results obtained4\nfrom the analyses are presented in Tables 1 and 2.5\n6\n3. Results and discussion7\n8\n3.1. Synthetic SRF characterisation9\nThe results from proximate and ultimate analyses of the fuels revealed that the net CV of the10\nsynthetic SRF was found to be 21.4 MJ\/kg (as received basis) in comparison to 13.15 MJ\/kg (as11\nreceived) for RDF. The net CV of SRF was comparable to that of coal (26.75 MJ\/kg, as received12\nbasis). The moisture and ash contents for RDF were found to be much higher in comparison to the13\nother two fuels. The chemical analyses of the SRF constituents suggested that paper contributed14\nmainly in the ash content of SRF. However, the volatile matter is much higher in SRF (79%) with15\nRDF and coal only containing 46% and 33% volatile matter, respectively. Other major components16\nsuch as, Cl and Hg in SRF were also found to be much lower quantity than RDF and coal. Higher17\nconcentrations of Hg, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr metals in RDF shows the presence of materials containing18\nhazardous components like batteries, cosmetics and paint (Sharma et al., 1997). Paper and plastics19\nare also sources of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd. Synthetic SRF contains smaller concentrations of these20\nmetals due to the absence of hazardous materials. RDF has the much higher quantities of Na and K21\nin comparison to synthetic SRF and coal. This indicates the presence of salt in the RDF originating22\nfrom food waste (Ward and Litterick, 2004). According to the CEN classification, the class code of23\n9synthetic SRF used in the present study will be designated as (European Committee for1\nStandardisation, 2006):2\n3\nClass code Net CV 2; Cl 1; Hg 1.4\n5\nSRF of this specification is suitable for cement kilns, power plants and fluidized bed6\ncombustion plants (van Tubergen et al., 2005). However, power plant operators may be more7\ninterested in the biomass content (Juniper Consultancy Services Ltd, 2005) as this can increase8\nrevenues in the form of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) (Ofgem, 2009). A material will9\nqualify as biomass if 90% of energy could be derived from the biogenic fraction (Department of10\nTrade and Industry (DTI), 2006). It is anticipated that MSW derived fuel can be made rich in11\nbiomass fraction by introducing partially stabilised biodegradable organic material in SRF, as the12\nbiogenic content of the SRF used in this study is likely to be significantly lower than 90% due to the13\nplastic content (15%).14\n15\n3.2. Fluidized bed combustor results16\n17\n3.2.1. Combustion performance18\nIn this study, coal, coal + 10%w\/w synthetic SRF and coal + 10%w\/w RDF fuels were19\ntested. The feed rate of the mixtures was varied from 6-9 kg\/h to maintain the temperature of the20\ncombustion unit. The fuel mixture having lower CV and higher moisture content required a higher21\nfeed rate. During combustion experiments, the fluidized bed temperature varied between 750 and22\n950 \u00b0C. Temperature profiles with time for three fuel\/ fuel mixtures revealed that temperature would23\nrarely reach 900 \u00b0C for coal and RDF mixture during the whole run (2.5 h), whereas for the coal and24\n10\nSRF mixture, the combustor attained a 950 \u00b0C temperature. This can be attributed to the higher1\nmoisture content of RDF (~30%) in comparison to synthetic SRF (~3%). Another reason could have2\nbeen the presence of more volatile matter in SRF (~79%) that leads to a sharp increase in3\ntemperature. The fuel having lower moisture content and high volatile matter exhibited a faster4\nincrease in temperature, consistent with previous literature (Ferrer et al., 2005). A summary of the5\nprocess conditions during the combustion trials is provided in Table 3.6\nBottom ash samples obtained after coal and coal + 10% SRF fuels combustion were tested7\nfor carbon content. Samples were heated in a furnace at a temperature of 550 \u00b0C for 2 h. No loss in8\nweight of coal bottom ash sample was observed, whereas a slight reduction (around 1%) was9\nobtained in the latter case. These results indicate zero or low levels of carbon containing compounds10\nin the ash.11\n3.2.2. Metal concentrations in flue gas samples12\nFigure 2 shows the concentrations of different metals in flue gases as a result of the13\ncombustion of different fuels. Metal emissions from coal combustion were found to be much lower14\nin comparison to the other fuel mixtures except for Cr, Zn and Ni. However, little difference was15\nobserved in metal emissions for the (coal +10% RDF) and (coal + 10% SRF) mixtures.16\nThe presence of Cu and Zn in the flue gas is indicative of the chloride species of the metals,17\nas reported earlier by Kouvo and Backman (Kouvo and Backman, 2003). Pb concentrations were18\nsimilar (~ 120 \uf06dg\/m3) in the flue gas samples obtained from coal and coal + 10% SRF. However,19\nthe flue gas sample from coal + 10% RDF combustion exhibited high Pb release (more than twice20\nthat obtained with other fuels). This may be due to the higher Pb concentration (~ 70 mg\/kg) in21\nRDF. According to a study reported by the Environment Agency in 2001 (Environment Agency,22\n2001), other metal emissions (such as Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Co, Mn etc.) must be below 1000 \uf06dg\/m3 for23\nco-combustion in cement kilns. In the present study, the sum of these metals was 660 \uf06dg\/m3 for coal24\n11\nand coal + 10% SRF fuels and 830 \uf06dg\/m3 for coal + 10% RDF. Nevertheless, Cd was higher in the1\nflue gas sample obtained from coal + 10% SRF sample than samples from the other two fuels,2\nthough this was well below the prescribed limits [max. (Cd + Tl) < 100 \uf06dg\/m3] (Environment3\nAgency, 2001), as is evident from Figure 2. Tl was found to be in non-detectable quantities in the4\nfuel samples. In comparison to unsorted MSW combustion (Chang et al., 1998), the coal + SRF5\nmixture showed much lower amounts of Pb and Cd.6\n7\n3.2.3. Metal analysis in ash samples8\nMetal concentrations were measured in bottom ash and fly ash samples obtained after the9\ncombustion of coal, coal + 10% SRF and coal + 10% RDF fuels. Results are shown in Figures 3 and10\n4. The release of different trace elements depends upon the volatility of metals and the fuel feed11\nrate. The more volatile metals will be present in the fly ash samples, and a higher fuel feed rate will12\nresult in more fuel being passed through the system, therefore introducing higher quantities of the13\nmetals.14\nAmong the tested elements, As, Cd, Hg and Pb are considered of principal concern. These metals15\nare the most volatile between 800 and 900 \u00b0C temperatures (Miller et al., 2002). From Figure 4, it is16\nindicated that the major fraction of these metals was found in fly ash. Cd and Pb releases were lower17\nin bottom and fly ash samples obtained from (coal + 10% SRF) fuel combustion than the other two18\nfuel\/fuel blends. From Figure 3, it is observed that in general the use of RDF as co-fuel increases19\nheavy metals accumulation in bottom ash except Zn, Mn and Hg. A higher metal release with the20\ncoal and RDF mixture was expected due the metals content being the highest in this fuel. However,21\nno significant difference in the metal concentrations was observed in fly ash samples obtained as a22\nresult of the combustion studies (Figure 4).23\n24\n12\n3.2.4. Relative distribution of metal contents in ash and flue gas stream1\nThe distribution of different metals among bottom ash, fly ash and flue gas was also seen for2\nthree combustion scenarios (Figures 5a, b and c). It is evident from the figures that a major part of3\nthe trace elements is retained in the ash. Only the significant quantities of Hg and As are released4\nwith flue gas into the atmosphere. Combustion studies with sewage sludge have revealed that5\ntypically between 75-98% of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn are retained in the ash (Cenni et al., 1998;6\nGeorge et al., 2010; Lopes et al., 2003; Werther and Ogada, 1999). It has also been found that most7\nof the mercury is released to the atmosphere via flue gas due to high volatility (Germani, 1988; Lee8\net al., 2006; Otero-Rey et al., 2003; Reddy et al., 2005; Sandelin and Backman, 2001; Werther and9\nOgada, 1999). During combustion, generally mercury is found in three forms, namely, particle-10\nbound, gaseous elemental mercury and in oxidized form (Lee et al., 2006). At high temperature in11\nthe combustion zone, Hg vaporises into the elemental form. With a temperature reduction, it is12\noxidized by flue gas components forming HgCl2 and HgO. A small fraction of Hg can also be13\ncondensed on ash particles due to temperature reduction. Otero-Rey et al. have reported that Cd, Mn14\nand Pb are readily incorporated in the bottom ash, whereas the larger fractions of As, Cr, Cu and Zn15\nare found in fly ash (Otero-Rey et al., 2003). Our results are consistent with Cu, Zn, As, Mn and Cr16\nin the samples obtained from coal only and (coal + 10% SRF) combustion studies. Cd was found in17\nthe fly ash rather than in bottom ash in all three combustion runs; this result is similar to that18\nobtained for coal combustion by Reddy et al. Significant quantities of arsenic were found in flue gas19\nstream (ca. 50%, 30% and 30% for coal, (coal + 10% SRF) and (coal + 10% RDF) combustion,20\nrespectively). Variation in the behaviour of metals can be attributed to the different fuel properties.21\nThe mass of a particular element can also affect the mobility of the metal (Sushil and Batra, 2006).22\nFor example, the lighter element such as Cu and Zn can be carried with fly ash. It has also been23\nfound that trace metals composition can be varied even from a single power plant. In addition to24\n13\nthese aspects, the particle size of feedstock may have an impact on metal fractionation in different1\nstreams. The presence of heavy metals in the ash samples is also influenced by the composition of2\nwaste and its handling (Chang et al., 1998).3\n4\n3.3. Thermogravimetric experiments5\nThermogravimetric experiments were carried out for the two major components of SRF6\n(paper and various plastics) in an air and nitrogen atmosphere to investigate the thermal behaviour7\nof these components. The results from this analysis are shown in Figures 6a and 6b.8\n9\n3.3.1. In the presence of air10\nFigure 6a illustrates the thermal behaviour of paper and plastic fractions (polyethylene,11\npolypropylene and PVC) in the presence of air. In all materials, initial weight loss with an increase12\nin temperature takes place due to moisture loss and volatilization. This stage is followed by gradual13\nor no further weight reduction before volatilisation. Polyethylene and polypropylene profiles14\nexhibited the sharp decrease in weight in the temperature range of 400-500 \u00b0C. However, almost no15\nash was found for polypropylene. An ash content of ca. 10% was obtained for polyethylene. For16\npaper, a weight loss of 10% was observed up to 300 \u00b0C heating due to the loss of moisture. This was17\nfollowed by two zones of sharp weight reduction (First zone: 300-375 \u00b0C and second zone: 375-50018\n\u00b0C). Beyond 500 \u00b0C, there was a continuous gradual reduction in weight to ca. 30% of the original,19\nwhich may go further with an increase in temperature due to the presence of inorganic fillers.20\nResults for paper are consistent with those found by other researchers (Guo et al., 2001; Lu et al.,21\n1996; Lu et al., 1999). However, the ash content was found to be much higher in comparison with22\nprevious studies. This may be a function of different types of paper. For PVC, weight loss due to23\nmoisture was negligible (as for other plastic components). Three zones for weight loss were24\n14\nobserved; (a) 300-350 \u00b0C, (b) 400-525 \u00b0C, and (c) 525-800 \u00b0C. It was found that the weight losses1\nin each temperature zone decreased with increasing temperature. A major fraction of weight2\nreduction (ca. 65%) was obtained during the first heating zone followed by ca. 15% and 8% weight3\nreduction in the second and third zones, respectively. The first weight loss for PVC may be due to4\nthe loss of HCl as reported by Lu et al. (Lu et al., 1996). The second and third weight loss might be5\ndue to the decomposition of the materials and combustion of carbon residue (Lu et al., 1996; Lu et6\nal., 1999).7\n8\n3.3.2. In the presence of nitrogen9\nThe thermal behaviour of paper, polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC was also observed in10\nan inert atmosphere (N2). TGA curves for different components are shown in Figure 6b. Similar11\ncurves were obtained for polypropylene and polyethylene. A single degradation zone was observed12\nfor each of these plastics. No char yield was observed for polypropylene, whereas, ca. 8% char was13\nformed for polyethylene. The TG curve for paper shows the loss of moisture in the first degradation14\nzone followed by faster weight loss over a temperature range of 300-350 \u00b0C in the second thermal15\ndegradation zone. Reduction in weight up to 350 \u00b0C was 50%. Beyond 350 \u00b0C, the gradual decrease16\nin weight loss might be attributed to the thermal degradation of calcium carbonate, which is used as17\nfiller in the paper manufacturing process (Cozzani et al., 1995). The TG pattern for PVC reveals a18\nweight reduction of ca. 60% in the first thermal degradation zone (in a temperature range of ~ 300-19\n350 \u00b0C). This might be due to the elimination of HCl and a small amount of benzene (Ma et al.,20\n2002). In the second thermal degradation zone, ca. 20% weight loss was observed, this might be21\nattributed to the pyrolysis of the polyethylene sequences that formed during the first stage (Ma et al.,22\n2002).23\n24\n15\n4. Conclusions1\nThe synthetic SRF (58% paper, 22% plastic, 15% textile and 5% wood) contained less2\nchlorine and mercury than Daw Mill coal and RDF. However, as for RDF, the composition of real3\nSRF is dependent on MSW composition and the type and performance of specific unit operations4\nemployed for preparing fuel from waste. The SRF prepared in the present study was suitable for5\ncement works and power sectors, as indicated by its characteristics. The biomass content of the SRF6\nwas ca. 70%. The pure coal and coal + 10% SRF mixture showed a comparable combustion7\nperformance for heavy metals release from flue gas and ash (bottom and fly ash) samples. The coal8\nand 10% RDF mixture produced slightly higher emissions.9\nThe relative distribution study confirms the findings of previous studies that most of the Hg10\nreleases into the atmosphere with flue gas and other heavy metals remain in ash. Volatility and mass11\nalso affect the mobility of trace elements in fly ash and bottom ash samples. A major portion of Cu,12\nZn, Cd, Pb, Cr and As were found in fly ash, whereas a large fraction of Mn remained in the bottom13\nash.14\nTG analysis was carried out to study the combustion behaviour of the main components of15\nwaste derived fuel. This provides the information on temperature ranges for various reactions taking16\nplace during the combustion or pyrolysis of the fuel.17\nThe results obtained from this study highlight the potential use of waste derived fuels, and18\nsupport the findings of an options appraisal of SRF by Garg et al (2009). A high calorific value, low19\nchlorine and mercury content, lower metal emissions and the comparatively inexpensive availability20\nof fuel could be attractive to cement kiln operators, power plants and industrial boiler facilities.21\nFuture studies should be targeted at measuring gaseous emissions. The share of SRF in the22\nfuel mixture should be increased (up to 20%) and the resulting emissions should be determined. The23\nkinetics of the TG analysis can be studied by performing differential thermal analysis.24\n16\n1\nAcknowledgements2\nThis research is funded by Grantscape under the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (Project No.3\n158\/169) with a consortium of contributing third parties.
