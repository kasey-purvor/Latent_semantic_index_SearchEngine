River terraces provide important records of uplift, which is essential for their \nformation, and of landscape evolution.  Their cyclic formation, however, almost invariably \nseems to have been a response to climatic fluctuation.  Sequences in the European core area of \nIGCP 449, which has the longest and most extensive research history, have been used as \ntemplates for worldwide comparison.  There is evidence for a global acceleration of uplift at \nthe time of, and perhaps in response to, the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, when climatic \nfluctuation switched to 100 ky Milankovitch cycles.  Terraces formed prior to this generally \nconsist of wide aggradational sheets that probably each represent formation over several 41 \nky cycles.  Subsequently, river valleys became more steeply entrenched and terraces formed \nin response to the stronger 100 ky climatic forcing, in many cases at approximately one per \ncycle.  This paper uses the new data resource to explore differences between records in \ndifferent climate zones, between sequences with variable numbers of Middle-Late Pleistocene \nterraces and between systems in which the all-important incision event has occurred in \ndifferent parts of climatic cycles.  Key records discussed include European examples from the \nRhine, Thames, Somme, Dniester, Dnieper, Don, Volga and Aguas; from Asia the Gediz \n(Turkey) and Orontes (Syria); from North America, the South Platte and Colorado; from \nSouth Africa the Vaal and Sundays; from Australia the Shoalhaven; and from South America, \nthe Amazon, Paraguay and tributaries of the Colorado and Negro.  \nKeywords: river terrace, climatic fluctuation, uplift, fluvial incision, climatic geomorphology, \ncrustal provinces \n \nPage 2; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \n1. Introduction \nThis paper arises directly from the activities of International Geoscience Programme (IGCP) \nProject No. 449 (Global Correlation of Late Cenozoic Fluvial Deposits), which has compiled \ndata on fluvial sedimentary records worldwide, enabling patterns and variations to be \nobserved in the resultant databank.  Fluvial sedimentary records can be divided into two main \ntypes, on the basis of preservation style: (1) stacks of deposits in superposition, although \ninvariably with numerous hiatuses, and (2) terraced sequences, where the more important \nhiatuses have coincided with incision below the base level of the pre-existing deposits, into \nbedrock.  This paper concerns the second of these types and will show, first, that they occur \nworldwide; second, that they have formed in response to climatic fluctuation; and third, that \nuplift is an essential requirement, with differences in uplift histories causing variations in \nterrace records between different areas and, in particular, different crustal provinces.   \nThe staircases of aggradational river terraces that constitute this second type of record \nsometimes show wide separation, such that the fluvial deposits of each terrace level never \ncome into contact with others in the terrace staircase.  Alternatively, separation can be much \nless, such that in vertical extent each set of deposits overlaps those of the terraces immediately \nabove and below within the staircase.  Variations in degree of terrace separation and, indeed, \nbetween terraced and stacked sequences, can occur within a single fluvial system, either \nupstream - downstream (e.g. the Rhine sequence; Fig. 1) or in terms of variation through time \n(e.g. the Dniester, Dnieper and Don sequences; Fig. 2).   The large dataset now assembled as a \nresult of IGCP 449 allows such patterns to be investigated and evaluated, providing insights \ninto their possible implications for understanding crustal and landscape evolution, key topics \nfor follow-up project IGCP 518 (Fluvial sequences as evidence for landscape and climatic \nevolution in the Late Cenozoic).   \nPage 3; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 1 \n \nRiver terrace formation in areas remote from lithospheric plate boundaries has often been \nattributed to base-level fluctuation, driven by the rising and falling of global sea level in \nresponse to Quaternary climatic fluctuation (McCave, 1969; T\u00f6rnqvist, 1998; Karner and \nMarra, 1998; Blum and Straffin, 2001), with aggradation thought to have occurred when the \nlower reaches of rivers were inundated by interglacial marine transgressions and incision at \ntimes of falling sea-level.  The role of that same climatic fluctuation in triggering the different \nfluvial activities seen in terrace records, particularly alternations between incision and \nsedimentation, has long been recognized (e.g. Zeuner, 1945; Wymer, 1968; Bourdier, 1968, \n1974; Antoine, 1994; Bridgland, 1994, 2000) and has been implicated as the driving force \nbehind terrace generation in areas remote from coastlines, where sea-level fluctuation seems \nunlikely to be influential (e.g., Tyr\u00e1\u010dek, 1983; Bull and Kneupfer, 1987; Green and \nMcGregor, 1987; Bull, 1991; Starkel, 2003).  This mechanism fits well with the empirical \nPage 4; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nevidence from fluvial sequences, even those nearer to coasts, which shows that much of the \naggradation, especially of gravel, has taken place under cold-climate conditions (e.g. Rose \nand Allen, 1977; Green and McGregor, 1980; Gibbard, 1985; Vandenberghe, 1995), at times \nwhen base levels were low and rivers should, according to the \u2018received wisdom\u2019 of the base-\nlevel paradigm, have been incising into their valley floors. \nFig. 2 \n \nThere is now a consensus that long-timescale terrace staircases are responses to, and therefore \nrecords of, regional uplift (e.g. Maddy, 1997; Antoine et al., 2000; Bridgland, 2000; van den \nBerg and van Hoof, 2001; Westaway et al., 2002, 2006a; cf. Kiden and Tornqvist, 1998).  \nKey to this line of thinking is that subsidence gives rise to stacked sequences, that uplift gives \nrise to terrace staircases and that without vertical movement of the crust rivers continue to \nflow at more or less the same relative level.  Recently areas of highly stable crust have been \nPage 5; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nrecognized in which exactly this last type of activity, or relative inactivity, has prevailed: \nArchaean cratons (Westaway et al., 2003; Fig. 3).  Such areas include parts of peninsular \nIndia and southern Africa (Helgren, 1977, 1978; Mishra 1995; Westaway et al., 2003; Fig. 3).  \nThis is not negative evidence; these areas have ancient fluvial deposits at or near to valley-\nfloor level, rather than tens of metres higher (contrast Fig. 3 with Fig. 2b).  The explanation \nfavoured by Westaway et al (2003) is that these cratonic areas have not experienced the \ntypical uplift that has raised surface levels in areas of younger crust and that this is because \nArchaean cratonic crust lacks the mobile lower crustal layer thought to be present in other, \nyounger, continental crust.  This is a result of its low radiogenic heat production and relatively \nthick (up to ~400 km) underlying lithosphere.  Younger continental crust typically reaches \n>350 \u00b0C at depth, the temperature threshold above which plastic flow can occur.  In contrast, \nArchaean cratonic crust is thought to be brittle throughout, preventing lower crustal flow.  \nCrustal loading and unloading, resulting indirectly from Quaternary climatic forcing (e.g. ice \nsheet formation and melting; fluctuating sea-level; erosion and sedimentation) is thought to \ninduce flow of lower crustal material from beneath areas that are subsiding to beneath areas \nthat are uplifting (cf. Westaway, 2001, 2002a,b).  If crustal stability is indeed the explanation \nfor such records as depicted in Figure 3, it is clear that areas with extensive terrace staircases \ncannot have been stable, as was long supposed (cf. Westaway et al., 2002).  A complicating \nfactor is that many cratonic regions lie within the tropical zone, where differences in \ngeomorphological processes might also be anticipated (B\u00fcdel, 1977, 1982; see below). \nPage 6; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 3 \n \nPage 7; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nSeveral modern researchers have identified Late Cenozoic uplift in many areas of Europe but \nhave generally attributed it to plate tectonic activity, particularly as a consequence of \ncompressive plate boundary forces causing \u2018buckling\u2019 of the continental lithosphere that can \nextend, in series of upward and downward 'ripples', for considerable distances (e.g., Nikishin \net al., 1997; Cloetingh et al., 2005). This interpretation envisages the uplift of various parts of \nnorth-west Europe, as evidenced by river terraces, as a distant response to the collision \nbetween the African and Eurasian plates.  It requires this entire area to be in compression, \nthus conflicting with evidence, such as normal faulting, that shows much of it to be in \nextension.  It cannot explain uplift in continental areas that are unrelated to compressive plate \nboundaries, so the discovery of comparable terrace staircases in such areas would pose a \nsignificant problem for the theory (see below). \nIf it is accepted that surface uplift has been influential in producing the terrace sequences in \nareas of post-Archaean crust, the IGCP 449 dataset can then be explored to see whether \ndifferent styles of terrace preservation can perhaps be related to rates and styles of uplift.  A \nlong-standing observation, of importance in understanding landscape evolution, is of \nimmediate relevance here.  It is well established that pre-Middle Pleistocene fluvial terraces \nare characterized by wide expanses of sediment that record significantly greater valley-floor \nwidths than are seen today, whereas terraces formed in the last million years or so record \nsteeper incision and the narrowing of valleys (e.g. Kukla, 1978; Maddy et al., 2000; Fig. 1b).  \nThis pattern has been attributed to accelerated uplift starting at ~900 ka (Kukla, 1975, 1977, \n1978; Meyer and Stets, 1998; Westaway, 2002a).  A similar pattern can now been recognized \nin areas of post-Archaean crust in every continent except Antarctica (cf. Westaway et al., \n2003).  The closeness in the timing of this change in uplift rates to the so-called \u2018Mid-\nPleistocene Revolution\u2019, when Milankovitch forcing of climatic cyclicity changed from \npredominantly 41 ky, obliquity-driven cycles to 100 ky eccentricity-driven cycles, is unlikely \nto be coincidental; instead a coupling between climatic fluctuation and the driving of uplift \nthrough lower crustal flow has been invoked, related to increased erosion brought about by \nthe greater severity of the 100 ky climatic cycles predominant since ~1 Ma (Westaway, \n2002a).  Being linked to crustal loading and unloading by ice sheets, sea-level change and \nerosion, climatic forcing of uplift can be expected to have intensified in response to the \nchange to 100 ky cycles.  It is thus a mechanism that can plausibly provide a linkage between \nQuaternary climate and landscape evolution.  \nPage 8; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \n \n2. Empirical evidence for climatic control of terrace formation \nSome of the most detailed fluvial records in the world are found in Europe, particularly in \nregions between the maximum extents of the Pleistocene Alpine and Scandinavian ice sheets \n(e.g., Figs 4 and 5).  Most of these sequences span the Middle and Late Pleistocene, many \nalso include the Early Pleistocene and a few extend back in time to the Pliocene and Miocene.  \nWithin these sedimentary archives are clues about the relation between fluvial activity and \nclimatic fluctuation, primarily where fossils are preserved within the fluvial sediments, since \nthese are often excellent indicators of palaeoclimate.  Also important is the growing databank \nof geochronology from fluvial archives, which, coupled with biostratigrapical evidence, \ndemonstrates approximate 100 ky cyclicity in terrace formation in many rivers: i.e., in \nsynchrony with the Milankovitch cycles since ~1 Ma.  This is by no means universal, many \nsequences having fewer terraces than one per 100 ky cycle and some having more.  There are \nalso potentially important differences as to when within the climate cycle the all-important \nincision event, leading to terrace formation, has occurred.  Based on evidence from the Lower \nThames (Fig. 4), Bridgland (2000) placed the downcutting during cold-to-warm transitions, as \nindicated by the occurrence of interglacial sediments in basal situations within each terrace.  \nIn the River Avon (English Midlands), the similar basal situation of interglacial remnants \nwithin terraces (Maddy et al., 1991) led to the same interpretation (Bridgland et al., 2004a).  \nIn other valleys in the same region of NW Europe, however, interglacial preservation is at or \nnear the tops of terrace \u2018treads\u2019, leading to the conclusion that the downcutting event has \noccurred at the warm-to-cold transition.  The Somme (Antoine, 1994; Antoine et al., 2000, \n2003, in press; Fig. 5) and the Moselle (Cordier et al. 2004, 2006) are examples of systems in \nwhich this style of record occurs.  It is possible that systems with many more terraces than \n100 ky cycles, such as the (now-drowned) River Solent of southern England, have seen \nterrace formation at both transition episodes (cf., Vandenberghe, 1995, this volume; \nBridgland, 2001).  However, it is perhaps equally likely that a response to Milankovitch \nsubstage fluctuation is instead indicated (Westaway et al., 2006a); more precise \ngeochronology will be required to determine which.  A modified version of the Bridgland \n(2000) climatic model for terrace formation is presented in Figure 6, in which the various \npossibilities are accommodated.  Vertical pairing of closely spaced terraces (Fig. 6B) would, \nas noted by Bridgland (2001), be expected where downcutting has occurred at both the \nPage 9; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nwarming and cooling transition, since the relative shortness of interglacials would mean the \nhighly unequal separation of these events by ~80 and 20ky, respectively.  Steady and \nprogressive uplift would therefore have led to a comparable inequality in terrace spacing; \ndowncutting at cooling-transitions might, therefore, coincide with shallow incision that fails \nto reach bedrock, whereas that at the warming transition might be expected to be much \ndeeper.  Indeed, major incision at cooling transitions (Fig. 6C) would perhaps only be \nexpected in situations where warming-transition incision has failed to occur, perhaps because \nsystems are swamped with sediment from destabilized landscapes, negating the increases in \ndischarge brought about by melting permafrost. \nPage 10; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 4 \n \nPage 11; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 5 \n \n \n \nPage 12; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 6 \n \n3. Terrace staircases worldwide \nAs noted above, the occurrence of extensive terrace sequences in NW and central Europe is \nwell established.  In the latter area the recognition of long and complex Quaternary \nstratigraphies based on loess\/soil sequences overlying river terrace deposits, in what was then \nCzechoslovakia (Kukla, 1975, 1977, 1978), paved the way for modern schemes in which \nterrestrial records are correlated with that from the deep oceans.  IGCP 449 has documented \nPage 13; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nimportant terrace sequences in the River Vltava, Czech Republic (Tyr\u00e1\u010dek et al., 2004), and \nthe Wipper and Ilm, central Germany (Mania, 1995; Schreve and Bridgland, 2002; Bridgland \net al., 2004b).  In the German examples there is excellent preservation of interglacial evidence \nwithin subaerial travertines that typically overlie cold-climate fluvial sediments, suggesting \nthat here, as in the Somme, downcutting has occurred following interglacials.  \n3.1 Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union \nAlthough poorly known in the west, considerable research has been undertaken on fluvial \nsequences in the former Soviet Union.  Summary review papers were therefore produced as \npart of IGCP 449, describing the sequences of the northern Black Sea and Caspian Sea rivers \n(Matoshko et al., 2002, 2004) and from rivers flowing to the Russian Arctic, namely the \nKolyma (Patyk Kara and Postolenko, 2004) and Lena (Alekseev and Drouchits, 2004).  The \nBlack Sea and Caspian rivers, in particular, have records of great significance.  Four south-\nflowing systems have been documented: the Dniester, Dnieper, Don and Volga (Matoshko et \nal., 2004; Fig. 2).  Considerable variation is seen in the vertical disposition patterns of their \nsedimentary sequences, apparently in direct relation to the type of underlying crust.  The \ndating of these various sequences makes use of biostratigraphical evidence from the \nsediments themselves, of overlying loess\/palaeosol records, of sedimentary evidence in their \nlower reaches for the fluctuation of sea level and, in their upper reaches, for the direct \ninfluence of northern glaciation.  Indeed, certain glaciations are named after the river basins in \nwhich they are best documented: the Don glaciation, correlated with MIS 16, and the Dnieper \nglaciation, generally attributed to MIS 8 (Matoshko et al., 2004). \nThe Dniester flows for ~700 km across Ukraine and Moldova, along the foreland basin of the \nCarpathian mountain range to the Black Sea, staying within the relatively young crust to the \nwest of the East European Platform (Fig. 2a).  As would be expected (see above), since it \nalone flows over \u2018normal\u2019 (i.e. relatively young and, therefore, relatively hot) continental \ncrust, the Dniester has a terrace staircase recording continuous surface uplift, amounting to \n~300 m in total, dating back to the Late Miocene (Fig. 2b).  These terraces, 15 in total, consist \nof fluvial gravels, deposited under a braided regime during cold episodes, overlain by finer-\ngrained deposits thought to represent temperate-stage overbank facies, which have yielded \nmost of the age-control evidence.  Again, therefore, this seems to suggest cooling-transition \ndowncutting.  The sequence can be divided into different phases of development based on \nclear variation in the style of terrace formation.  Working backwards, the lowest seven \nPage 14; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nterraces record incision by the Dniester in approximate synchrony with the 100 ky climatic \ncycles of the last million years, although the MIS 10 cycle is apparently missing (replaced by \na wider vertical separation between the MIS 12 and MIS 8 terraces - see Fig. 2b).  The earlier \npart of the sequence is made up of thicker and more extensive terrace deposits, probably \nrepresentative of multiples of the shorter cycles that characterized the Miocene to Early \nPleistocene, as in sequences in NW Europe, such as the Thames (Maddy et al., 2000; \nWestaway et al., 2002).  The terrace staircase is inset into an aggradational (stacked) sequence \nof older fluvial deposits (the Balta Group) biostratigraphically dated to the Late Miocene (Fig. \n2b).  \nThe Dnieper and Don, further east, also flow into the Black Sea, but their courses lie largely \nwithin the Ukrainian shield (Fig. 2a).  In contrast to the \u2018classic staircase\u2019 of the Dniester, the \nDnieper and Don sequences record a mix of incision and aggradation, presumably driven by \nalternating uplift and subsidence.  Although rates of vertical crustal motion have at times been \nsubstantial (as indicated by differences in altitude of successive terraces; Fig. 2c and d), they \nwere later cancelled out by reversals in the sense of motion, such that the total net movement \nindicated has never exceeded a few tens of metres.  The fluvial sequences of the Ukrainian \nShield (Fig. 2c, d) are certainly different from those of Archaean cratons but, with their \nindication of long-periodicity fluctuation between uplift and subsidence (producing no great \nnet vertical change over Quaternary timescales), they also differ considerably from those \ntypical of younger crust. The Early Proterozoic crust of this shield is intermediate in terms of \nage and thermal state between the Archaean and the near-ubiquitous younger crustal types and \nmight therefore include a thin mobile lower-crustal layer.   \nThe Volga, even further east, flows into the landlocked Caspian Sea along a course that lies in \npart within the East European Platform and in part within the Pre-Caspian Block, north of the \nCaspian Sea.  The Pre-Caspian Block represents crustal basement of unknown origin (e.g., \nNikishin et al., 1996), which is thought to have accreted against the SE margin of the East \nEuropean Platform in the Late Proterozoic; drilling has reached latest Proterozoic (Vendian) \nsediments but not the underlying basement. This crust is evidently strong, since no significant \ndeformation has occurred throughout the Phanerozoic. It has been suggested that it is a \ntrapped fragment of oceanic lithosphere (cf. \u015eeng\u00f6r et al., 1993), overlain by sufficient \nsediment to create a subaerial land surface. Such oceanic crust can be presumed to lack a \nmobile lower layer, thereby mimicking the high stability of Archaean cratons (cf. Westaway \nPage 15; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \net al., 2003).  Thus the Lower Volga sequence shows accumulation of sediments of different \nages within a narrow height range relative to the altitude of the modern river (Fig. 2e), \nindicative of little net vertical movement since the Early Pleistocene.   \n \n3.2 Mediterranean rivers \nTurning to a warm temperate region, generally beyond the reach of Quaternary glaciation, two \nexample systems from opposite ends of the Mediterranean, both receiving recent attention \nrelated to IGCP 449, will be reviewed.  The first is the River Aguas, which drains the Late \nCenozoic Sorbas and Vera Basins of SE Spain, and the second is the River Orontes of western \nSyria.  The basins drained by the Aguas record marine conditions until the Early Pliocene. \nbroken only during the Messinian salinity crisis, followed by fluvial environments thereafter \n(Harvey and Wells, 1987; Stokes and Mather, 2000; Schulte, 2002; Mather and Stokes, 2003; \nBraga et al., 2003).  In the SW Vera Basin, Early Messinian reefs (pre-dating the salinity \ncrisis; age ~7-6.5 Ma) crop out at ~600 m a.s.l., whereas Early Pliocene marine sediments are \nfound nearby at ~500 m a.s.l. (Braga et al., 2003).  There has thus been significant uplift since \nthe Messinian, at time-averaged rates of ~0.1 mm a-1.  This region forms the northern part of \nthe convergent boundary zone between the African and Eurasian plates, which has led many \nauthors to ascribe the uplift, and its effect on fluvial activity, to active tectonic processes \n(Harvey and Wells, 1987; Stokes and Mather, 2000; Schulte, 2002; Mather and Stokes, 2003).  \nHowever, local rates of relative plate motion are very low, no more than a few millimetres per \nyear (e.g., Westaway, 1990; DeMets et al., 1994), too little to have caused convergent crustal \nthickening sufficient to account for the observed uplift rates throughout a zone several \nhundred kilometres wide (cf. Mitchell and Westaway, 1999).  Harvey and Wells (1987) \ninterpreted this as evidence of epeirogenic (i.e., regional) uplift, onto which local effects of \nactive faulting are superimposed, a view very similar to the ideas now emerging from other \nparts of the Mediterranean region (e.g., Mitchell and Westaway, 1999; Arger et al., 2000; \nWestaway et al., 2006b). \nPage 16; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 7 \n \nThe Aguas has a staircase of sub-parallel terraces, thought to span the period since the Middle \nPliocene (Schulte, 2002; Fig. 7).  Comparison of their heights above the modern valley floor \nwith the altitudes of dated marine terraces on the nearby coast (Schulte, 2002) is an important \naid in dating the Aguas sequence.  Modelling the fluvial incision and causative uplift, on this \nbasis, results in an estimate of the latter not significantly at variance with those in other \nregions of relatively young continental crust (Fig. 8), raising serious doubts about whether \nplate tectonic activity has any role in influencing this effect. \nPage 17; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 8 \n \nIn the eastern Mediterranean region terrace sequences are known from the Nile (Said, 1981), \nthe Euphrates (Tyr\u00e1\u010dek, 1987; Demir et al., 2004), the Jordan (Bar-Yosef, 1998), and many \nrivers in Turkey (Demir et al., 2004).  Active crustal deformation in this region has led to \nsome atypical fluvial records, with rivers affected by faulting and volcanism (e.g., Ozaner, \n1992; Bunbury et al., 2001; Westaway et al., 2005, 2006b; Demir et al., 2004).  Another \neastern Mediterranean fluvial archive that has come to light during IGCP 449 is from the \nPage 18; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nUpper Orontes in Syria, studied by the present authors as part of long-running archaeological \nsurvey based on Homs (Bridgland et al., 2003).  This continuing study seeks to relate \nPalaeolithic artefact assemblages from the area south of Homs to aggradational terraces of the \nOrontes, which have been newly mapped in a wide area to the east of the river (Fig. 9).  \nBridgland et al. (2003) reported a well-preserved staircase of at least 12 terraces in the 130 m \nabove the river (Fig. 9), identified in the 2001 field season.  Subsequent work in 2002 and \n2003 has identified several more terraces up to ~200 m above the river.   \nFig. 9 \n \nData from the upper Orontes supplement previous findings from the Middle reach of the river \n(e.g. Besan\u00e7on and Sanlaville, 1993; Dodonov et al., 1993), including the record from a key \nfossiliferous Palaeolithic site at Latamneh, ~80 km north of Homs (Fig. 9a).  A mammalian \nassemblage from here can be ascribed to the mid-Middle Pleistocene; its combination of \nStephanorhinus hemitoechus and Megaloceros verticornis has no exact parallel in Europe, \nwhere the former post-dates and the latter pre-dates MIS 12. This was used by Bridgland et al. \n(2003) to calibrate the age of their sequence from the Upper Orontes to around the time of this \nglacial (Fig. 9b).  A further constraint is provided by the time of eruption of the latest \nMiocene Homs Basalt, which blocked any pre-existing drainage in this region; following this \neruption the river has incised by ~400 m (Bridgland et al., 2003).  Again the amounts of uplift \nPage 19; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nindicated are comparable with post-Archaean crust remote from plate boundaries, suggesting \nthat no special effect applies to the Orontes related to its situation in the (active) Dead Sea \nFault Zone (the active boundary zone between the African and Arabian plates; cf. Westaway, \n2004).  Localized uplift related to this fault zone has been recognized, but is concentrated to \nthe west rather than the east, where the Orontes flows (cf. Westaway, 2004). \nAnother Eastern Mediterranean river system with a long-timescale record is the Gediz in \nwestern Turkey. This system is situated sufficiently far from any major active faults for it to \nbe clear that it has responded to regional uplift, not local tectonic effects. In the vicinity of the \nKula Quaternary volcanic field, this river has produced a staircase of terraces indicating ~400 \nm of incision since the Pliocene (e.g., Westaway et al., 2004, 2006b; Maddy et al., 2005).  \nBasalt lavas have provided both excellent preservation of underlying Gediz deposits and, \nusing K\/Ar and Ar\/Ar techniques, a means of dating the fluvial activity. In particular, there \nare 11 high-level terraces (~200-140 m above the modern Gediz) that, from the available \ndating of the overlying basalt and from uplift-modelling constraints, may represent successive \n41 ky (Early Pleistocene) Milankovitch cycles (Maddy et al., 2005; Westaway et al., 2006b).   \nPlentiful supplementary evidence is available in support of the notion that the relatively \nyoung continental crust in the Mediterranean region has behaved in a similar way to that (of \npost-Archaean age) elsewhere in the world.  To the terrace sequences of the Nile and \nEuphrates (already mentioned) can be added, as evidence of surface uplift, the terraces of the \nKebir and the occurrence of raised beaches along the Syrian and Lebanese coasts.  Around \nLatakia, northern Syria (Fig. 9a), marine terraces alternate with the Kebir terraces (Besan\u00e7on \net al., 1978; Besan\u00e7on and Sanlaville, 1984), indicating that the river terraces did not form \nduring interglacial high-stands (e.g., Copeland and Hours, 1993).  This is important in that it \nsuggests that fluvial aggradation occurred during cold stages, as in the areas further north.  \nWhether temperature fluctuation or variation in precipitation is the key forcing factor for \nclimatic triggering of terrace formation in these warmer regions remains uncertain, however.  \nThe effects of aridity\/precipitation fluctuations on fluvial discharge and sediment load might \nbe comparable with those of temperature; like temperature cycles, humidity fluctuations \nwould be expected to operate both directly and indirectly, the latter by means of their \ninfluence on vegetation density and, thereby, on slope stability (see below).  The two types of \ncycle are likely to be inter-related (e.g. Rossignol-Strick, 1999) and their individual \ncontributions difficult to resolve. \nPage 20; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \n3.3 North America  \nIn marked contrast to Europe, river terrace records have had limited prominence in North \nAmerican Quaternary studies.  The Mississippi terraces are well known, but there is a paucity \nof biostratigraphical control on their ages, dating having instead been achieved with reference \nto Laurentian glaciations, which have fed melt-water southwards into this river, and loess-soil \nsequences overlying the terraces (cf. Fisk, 1951; Saucier, 1996; Blum et al., 2000).  North \nAmerican rivers in areas within the zone of repeated Pleistocene glaciation have restricted \nrecords, with little evidence as old as Middle Pleistocene (e.g. Clet-Pellerin and Occhietti, \n2000).  Despite extending well south of the maximum glacial limits, the Lower Mississippi \nterrace sequence can be dated back only to the Middle Pleistocene (Blum et al., 2000; Blum \nand Straffin, 2001), but other systems in the southern part of the continent have records \nspanning the Late Cenozoic and sometimes even the whole of the Cenozoic.  Notable \namongst these is the Susquehanna (e.g., Pazzaglia and Gardner, 1994). \nOne of the best-documented North American records of uplift-driven fluvial incision comes \nfrom right-bank tributaries of the Missouri - Mississippi system that drain eastward from the \nRocky Mountains across the central United States, a notable example being the River Platte \n(Fig. 10).  This system consists of two principal affluents, both with notable terrace staircases.  \nThe South Platte flows through the city of Denver, Colorado, where it has incised by ~500 m \ninto the Miocene \/ (?) Early Pliocene landscape (Fig. 10), whereas the North Platte flows \nacross eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska, where it has formed a comparable terrace \nstaircase within the High Plains (Reed et al., 1965; McMillan et al., 2002; Heller et al., 2003).  \nThere is every reason to suppose that, as elsewhere in the temperate latitudes, these terrace \nsequences have formed as a result of climatic forcing of fluvial activity set against a \nbackground of surface uplift (cf. McMillan et al., 2002).  The sequences exemplified by \nFigure 10 imply terrace formation at a lower frequency than once per 100 ky Milankovitch \ncycle, with only the major climatic oscillations represented, as in certain European rivers (see \nabove).  The apparent absence of any MIS 12 terrace, also a notable feature of the \nSusquehanna sequence (Westaway, in press), is in marked contrast with European records. \nPage 21; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 10 \n \nDramatic Late Cenozoic fluvial incision has also been documented in western North America, \nthe most famous example being the ~1500 m deep Grand Canyon of the River Colorado in \nArizona.  Time-averaged incision of this canyon has been calculated as ~0.1 mm a-1, from its \nrelation to dated Miocene volcanism (Damon et al., 1974). Along the canyon the amounts of \nincision show a general downstream decrease; for instance, the incision since ~500 ka has \nbeen ~260 m near the upstream end of the canyon in SE Utah (Garvin et al., 2005) but only \n~30-50 m, ~200-300 km to the WSW in NW Arizona (e.g., Lucchitta et al., 2000; Pederson et \nal., 2002). However, the extent to which this results from the localized effects of vertical slip \non active faults, rather than true regional-scale tapering in the regional uplift has yet to be \ndetermined (cf. Pederson et al., 2002, 2003; Hanks and Blair, 2003). \nPage 22; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 11 \n \n \n The clearest evidence for the history of long-timescale incision by the Colorado \nsystem is derived from upstream of the Grand Canyon, in the Grand Valley region of western \nColorado state, around Grand Junction (Fig. 11). This dataset represents localities up to ~150 \nkm apart; there is thus the possibility that uplift histories and\/or rheological properties of the \ncrust have varied laterally (as for the Dnieper \u2013 see Fig. 2c caption); furthermore, there is \nevidence of some local variation in vertical motion associated with minor active faulting (e.g., \nKellogg, 2004).  A total of ~1650 m of fluvial incision is evident since the Middle Miocene \n(Fig. 11). The oldest evidence is provided by dating to ~10 Ma of the basalt cap of Grand \nMesa, this basalt being thought to have flowed into a palaeo-valley occupied by the ancestral \nColorado. Dramatic incision occurred down to the level of the next marker, the Spruce Ridge \nbasalt, which is dated to ~7.8 Ma and caps fluvial gravel at 847 m above the river (Figs 11 \nand 12).  Notable subsequent increases in rates of uplift and incision are evident around 3 Ma \nand 0.9 Ma (Fig. 12). \nPage 23; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 12 \n \n3.4 Southern Africa \nThis is a temperate-climate region of the southern hemisphere in which the effects of \nQuaternary glacial - interglacial fluctuation would be expected to have left a record \ncomparable to those in equivalent regions of the northern hemisphere; climatically, these \nwould be the Mediterranean regions.  Southern Africa has already featured above, in \nconnection with the Archaean cratonic area at its core.  This is drained by the Vaal, which has \na Late Cenozoic fluvial sequence of restricted vertical range (Fig. 3d), starting with the \nMiocene Proksch Koppie and Wedburg gravels (Fig. 3c).  The oldest Vaal gravel shown in \nFigure 3d, the \u2018Younger Gravel A\u2019, is of Pliocene \u2013 Early Pleistocene age, indicating no \nsignificant fluvial incision during the Quaternary in this craton.  However, younger crust is \nalso to be found in southern Africa, ranging in age from Early Proterozoic to Palaeozoic.  A \npublished fluvial record from outside the cratonic area, from the Sundays River in the \nNamaqua-Natal crustal province (Middle-Late Proterozoic) and the Cape Foldbelt \n(Palaeozoic), provides an important contrast with the Vaal.    \nThe Sundays has, in its lower reaches, a well-developed terrace staircase (e.g., Hattingh, \n1994; Hattingh and Goedhart, 1997; Hattingh and Rust, 1999; Fig. 13).  The terraces remain \nsubparallel across the transition between the Namaqua-Natal crustal province and the Cape \nPage 24; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFoldbelt, suggesting that the uplift response within these crustal provinces has been similar.   \nNo direct age-control is available for any of the Sundays terraces, so it is necessary to \nestimate their ages based on relations with other datable deposits and by modelling the fluvial \nincision they record, the latter using the methodology of Westaway (2001; Westaway et al., \n2002; Fig 14). Minimum-age dating control is provided by marine sediments at ~450 m a.s.l. \nnear Kirkwood, which have been attributed to the Middle Pliocene (McMillan, 1990) and \nwhich pre-date the full Sundays sequence (Fig. 13). Taking the age of these marine sediments \nas ~3 Ma, a subsequent time-averaged uplift rate of ~0.15 mm a-1 is indicated. Assuming \nsimple progressive uplift over this period, however, cannot provide a sensible explanation for \nthe configuration of the terraces in the Sundays valley.  Modelling a pulse of accelerated \nuplift in response to the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, as is seen in well-dated sequences from \nother parts of the world (and demanded by the principles of lower crustal flow forcing - see \nabove; Westaway et al., 2006b), provides a much better match for the Sundays terraces (Fig. \n14).  Indeed, it is also broadly consistent with the set of ages inferred by Maud (1968) for the \nstaircase of marine terraces east of the Sundays estuary.   \nPage 25; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFig. 13 \n \nIt should be noted that this interpretation differs significantly from that proposed by Hattingh \nand Rust (1999). They adopted a different age model, after Le Roux (1989, 1990), in which \nthe ~450 m marine deposits were attributed to the Late Miocene, rather than Middle Pliocene. \nIn their view, Sundays terraces T1 to T9 formed in the Late Miocene and Pliocene, with only \nT10 to T13 assigned to the Pleistocene. Furthermore, in their view the fluvial incision resulted \nfrom global eustatic sea-level fall, not regional uplift; however, the idea that sea-level could \nhave fallen by ~450 m since the Miocene (or Pliocene) is irreconcilable with the subsequent \nPage 26; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nnet increase in global ice volume. The alternative McMillan (1990) age model for the marine \nsediments, adopted here, has also been preferred in other recent studies of the Late Cenozoic \nevolution of this region (e.g., Partridge, 1997, 1998).   \nFig. 14 \n \nThe modelling results presented in Figure 14 thus envisage an increase in uplift rates in the \nLate Pliocene, followed by a relative lull in the Early Pleistocene, then a renewed increase in \nthe Middle Pleistocene, when the Sundays River switched from aggrading across a broad \nregion to a relatively narrow gorge, represented by terrace T4 onwards (Hattingh and Rust, \n1999; Fig. 13b).  This similarity suggests that the Sundays terraces have probably formed in \nthe same way as those in Northern Hemisphere systems, in response to climatic forcing.  \nThe main difference between these African records and river terrace staircases in Europe \nPage 27; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nconcerns the relative magnitudes of the Late Pliocene and Middle Pleistocene uplift phases.  \nThe present-day climate of most of the Sundays catchment is arid, with mean annual rainfall \nno more than ~300 mm (e.g., Schulze, 1972).  Since there has been no Pleistocene glaciation \nin southern Africa, the most likely forcing agents for Middle Pleistocene uplift (by way of \nlower crustal flow) are erosion and cyclic loading of the continental crust beneath the offshore \ncontinental shelf in response to global sea-level fluctuations (Westaway, 2002a). The \nmagnitude of this effect is evidently a consequence of high mobility of the lower crust in this \nregion, due to its high heat flow. The even greater uplift rates deduced for the Late Pliocene \nthus require an additional cause: probably enhanced erosion. High rates of Late Pliocene \nerosion can be envisaged in this region, arising from the much wetter climatic regime known \nto have prevailed at that time (e.g., Tankard and Rogers, 1978; Tankard et al., 1982; Tyson, \n1986). \n3.5 Australia \nAustralia is well known as a stable and ancient landscape, an axiom consistent with the \noccurrence there of significant cratonic provinces; much of Western Australia coincides \nwith the Archaean Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons, identified as further examples of stable \nareas lacking Late Cenozoic terrace staircases by Westaway et al. (2003).  The extreme \nstability of Australian Archaean crust is underpinned by estimates of Cretaceous sea-level \nand corresponding shorelines, which indicate net vertical motions since the Cretaceous of a \nfew tens of metres at most (cf. Beard, 1998; Westaway et al., 2003). \n \nRelative inactivity in other parts of this southern continent can perhaps be ascribed to \nincreasing aridity - well documented in the internally draining Lake Eyre Basin (e.g., \nKershaw and Nanson, 1993; Nanson and Price, 1998).  The largest fluvial system in \nAustralia, the Murray-Darling, can be shown to have existed since at least the Eocene and \nfor much of its history fed into a subsiding depocentre, in which several hundreds of \nmetres of fluvial, lacustrine and marine sediments accumulated (e.g., Brown and Radke, \n1989; Stevenson and Brown, 1989).  However, as in other parts of the world, uplift in the \nLate Cenozoic, estimated to be 60-110m since the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene \n(e.g., Huntley et al., 1993, 1994; Murray-Wallace et al., 1996) at a rate of between ~0.07 \nand ~0.13 mm a-1, has led to incision into the earlier deposits and the formation of both \nfluvial and marine terraces.  The uplift chronology is constrained by the dating of \nPage 28; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nQuaternary basalt of the Mount Gambier \/ Mount Schank volcanic field (cf Sheard, 1990), \nwhich caps Middle Pleistocene marine terrace deposits along the Southern Ocean coastline \nof eastern South Australia, ~300 km SSE of the mouth of the Murray. Uplift rates vary \nalong this coastline, being lower in the vicinity of the mouth of the Murray and in the \ncratonic region farther west (e.g., Murray-Wallace, 2002). \n \nA well-researched terrace record from ~900 km further ENE is that of the River Shoalhaven, \nwhich drains from the Great Dividing Range eastwards into the Tasman Sea to the south of \nSydney (e.g., Nott, 1992; Nott et al., 2002; Fig. 15).  According to Nott (1992), this river is \nancient, having existed (like the Murray) throughout the Cenozoic.  By the Oligocene it had \nestablished a broad valley, but in the Late Oligocene (~30 Ma) a basalt eruption dammed the \nriver, creating a lake, ~80 km long, in which up to 60 m of sediment was deposited.  The \nShoalhaven has since incised into this Oligocene sediment by ~40 m, forming a staircase of \nsix terraces, the youngest four of which have been dated by Nott et al. (2002) to MIS 12, 8, 4, \nand 2, using the TL technique (Fig. 15).  Uplift modelling of this terrace staircase (not \nillustrated) suggests that the two oldest terraces may relate to MIS 22 and MIS 14 (Fig. 15), \nindicating typical uplift rates during the Middle-Late Pleistocene of ~0.05 mm a-1. Simple \nextrapolation of the pattern of terrace heights in Figure 15 leads to the same conclusion.   \n \nFig. 15 \n \n \nComparative data are provided by the staircase of marine terraces on the adjacent coast of \nsouthern New South Wales. According to Young and Bryant (1993), there are Middle-Late \nPage 29; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nPleistocene wave-cut platforms at 2 m (from MIS 5c or 5a), 4 m (MIS 5e), and 8 m a.s.l. (MIS \n9 or older), all dated using amino acid, uranium series, or TL techniques, plus older undated \nplatforms at 10 m a.s.l. (? Early Pleistocene) and ~20-30 m a.s.l. (? Miocene or older). \nNeglecting any effect of global eustatic sea-level fall, the uplift rate of this coastline was thus \nonly ~0.002 mm a-1 during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene (for ~10 m of uplift during ~6 \nto ~1 Ma) but ~0.01 mm a-1 since, again suggesting an increase in uplift rates in the early \nMiddle Pleistocene, although the rates involved are lower here than elsewhere in the region. \n \nThe evidence from the Shoalhaven (Fig. 15), which suggests terrace formation in approximate \nsynchrony with Milankovitch cycles (like many rivers in the northern hemisphere), is thus \nconsistent with the evidence from marine terraces in SE Australia.  Both point to an increase \nin uplift rates in the late Early Pleistocene or early Middle Pleistocene, just as in many other \nregions of the world.   \n \n3.6 South America \n \nDespite including the world\u2019s largest river system, the Amazon, relatively little is known of \nfluvial records in South America, with few reported terrace sequences.  There have, however, \nbeen IGCP 449 contributions from Uruguay\/Argentina (Parana-Uruguay system \u2013 Ubilla, \n2004) and from Amazonia (Latrubesse and Rancy, 2000; Latrubesse, 2002; Westaway, \n2006a).  Much of Amazonia is on the Archaean crust of the Amazon Craton, which, given the \nobservations noted above (cf. Westaway et al., 2003), might well explain the paucity of \nreported river terraces.  Closer examination of the known geomorphology of this largely \ninaccessible region shows that terraces have indeed been recorded from patches of younger \ncrust around the Amazon craton, although they are generally poorly researched.  For example, \naround Rio Branco, western Brazil, west of the Amazon Craton (location of an IGCP 449 \nfield meeting in June 2003), terraces occur at up to 70m above the present level of Amazon \ntributaries such as the Acre and Purus (Latrubesse et al., 1997; Westaway, 2006a; Fig. 16). \nThese terraces are inset into an older stacked fluvial\/lacustrine succession (the Solim\u00f5es \nGroup), deposition of which ended ~3 Ma (from biostratigraphy and Ar-Ar dating of \ninterbedded tuff: cf. Westaway, 2006a). Terraces have also been documented from other \ntributaries of the Amazon, including the Jurua, Las Piedras and Madre de Dios, in both \nwestern Brazil and adjacent parts of Peru (~7-13\u00b0 S; e.g., R\u00e4s\u00e4nen  et al., 1992; Latrubesse et \nal., 1997; Westaway, 2006a). \nPage 30; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nFurther south, the River Mendoza, one of the most northerly tributaries of the Colorado \nsystem in central-western Argentina, has a staircase of at least six terraces (Brunotte, 1983).  \nIn a region of the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes that has witnessed cold-stage glacial \nadvances (e.g., Espizua, 2000), these terraces relate to sedimentary complexes comprising \npediments that pass downslope into fluvial or fluvioglacial aggradations.  Brunotte (1983) \nnoted that the oldest of these pediments is inset into a stacked sequence of fluvial \nconglomerate, the Mogotes Formation, of inferred Pliocene age, and that the top of this (at \n~2500 m a.s.l.) is ~1200 m above present river level.  \nFig. 16 \n \nAnother Colorado tributary, the Diamante, ~150 km further south (around 34\u00b0 30\u2019 S), has a \nstaircase of five terraces (Grosso and Corte, 1989).  The highest of these is up to ~200 m \nabove the river, over a zone many kilometres wide, inset into which are younger, much \nnarrower terraces.  On the basis of regional correlations, these five terraces (in reversed \nstratigraphical order) have been dated (Grosso and Corte, 1989) to the Late W\u00fcrm (i.e., MIS \n2), Early W\u00fcrm (~MIS 4), \u2018Late Pleistocene\u2019 (possibly MIS 6), \u2018Middle Pleistocene\u2019 (~ MIS \n12), and Early Pleistocene (~1.2-1.0 Ma).  The attribution of terrace 2 to MIS 12 is based on \nthe presence in sediments at a corresponding position in an adjacent river of deposits from an \nAndean pyroclastic flow dated to ~450 ky ago (Stern et al., 1984).  According to Baker and \nGosse (2003), rates of incision in this reach of the Diamante during the Middle and Late \nPleistocene, based on this and other dating constraints, were typically ~0.2 mm a-1, consistent \nwith an age of ~1 Ma for the ~200 m fluvial terrace.  These observations suggest that a broad \nriver valley existed here in the Early Pleistocene but became progressively entrenched in the \nMiddle-Late Pleistocene, exactly as is recorded in many European systems (see above).  \nPage 31; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nWork in progress to date the incision history of the Diamante using cosmogenic isotopes (cf. \nGosse et al., 2005) will enable this hypothesis to be tested.   \n \nBetter documented are the terraces of the River Neuquen, a major affluent of the Negro, in \ncentral-southern Argentina.  Garleff et al. (1983) have described four Neuquen terraces at up \nto 100m above river level.  There is no age control, although Garleff et al. suggested that the \nlowest two terraces represented the last two glacials.  The imprecision of the age \ninterpretations from all these South American studies, together with the absence of any direct \nevidence for warm-stage activity, makes it impossible to establish whether climatic forcing \nhas taken place, let alone explore its style.  Nonetheless, this southern part of the continent \nhas experienced similar climatic fluctuations to the areas in Europe in which the classic \nsequences of river terraces have formed, so it is tempting to suggest that a comparable \nmechanism of terrace generation has been active here. \n \n4. Discussion: climatic forcing of terrace formation \nFrom the worldwide examination undertaken as part of IGCP 449, terrace staircases are seen \nas ubiquitous features in landscapes all over the planet, recording significant fluvial incision \nduring the Late Cenozoic, especially during the Middle and Late Pleistocene.  The case \nstudies reviewed above represent selected fluvial records from around the world, which, \nthanks especially to the work of project contributors, allow a level of international comparison \nhitherto impossible.  A key comparative feature is uplift, which can be estimated from river \nterrace sequences and shows both remarkable similarities between regions as well as notable \ncontrasts between different crustal types.  There is reason to suggest that climate and uplift are \ncoupled through mechanisms such as the isostatic response to changes in rates of erosion (cf. \nWestaway, 2001, 2002a).  An important aspect of this is the apparently worldwide increase in \nuplift rates following the \u2018Mid-Pleistocene Revolution\u2019, seemingly a response to the start of \n100 ky Milankovitch forcing.  Furthermore, longer-timescale sequences such as those from \nthe Rhine (Fig. 1), Maas (van den Berg, 1994;  van den Berg and van Hoof, 2001), Dniester \n(Fig. 2) and Colorado (Fig. 11) show increases in uplift rates around 3 Ma; i.e. coincident \nwith the climatic deterioration following the Middle Pliocene optimum (Westaway, 2002b).  \nWhere terrace levels can be dated, the vertical separation from the modern valley floor \nindicates time-averaged incision rates since ~1 Ma that vary between ~0.03 mm a-1 (e.g. the \nPage 32; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nSusquehanna; Westaway, in press) and ~0.2 mm a-1 (e.g., the Rhine; Figs 1 and 8f).  Evidence \nfrom the best-dated long sequences, such as that from the Dniester (Fig. 2b), allow this \nincision record to be further resolved and interpreted as a measure of the pace of the surface \nuplift that has driven the downcutting.  As already noted, however, this pattern is recognized \nonly on post-Archaean crust; records from more ancient, cratonic areas, such as the Indian \nsubcontinent and the Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa, show little net uplift during the Late \nCenozoic (Fig. 3).  This has led to the conclusion that only continental crust consolidated in \nthe last ~2500 Ma retains the hot, mobile lower layer in which such vertical movement is \ngenerated (see above; Westaway et al., 2003).   \nAn important additional observation that can now be made is that intermediate situations \nexist, in which fluvial records show fluctuating uplift and subsidence of long periodicity, with \nlimited net change in level.  These appear to be characteristic of Early Proterozoic crust, such \nas that forming the Ukrainian Shield, as indicated by the Dnieper and Don records (see above; \nFig. 2c, d); such crust retains only a thin mobile lower layer and so is indeed intermediate \nbetween Archaean cratons and crust younger than the Middle Proterozoic. To a lesser extent \nthe record from the Colorado (Fig. 11), again characterized by fluctuating uplift and \nsubsidence of long periodicity, is a further example of this effect.   \nThe thickness of the mobile lower crust can be characterized by the parameter Wi, defined in \nthe caption of Figure 8. The modelling of the Colorado data in Figure 12 requires Wi=6 km, \nsignificantly less than the various examples from younger crustal provinces in Figure 8; \nsimilar modelling for the Dnieper and Don, not illustrated, requires Wi=5 km. The principal \ncause of the thinness of the mobile lower crustal layer in both these Early Proterozoic \nexamples appears to be the presence of a thick layer of mafic material (which will not flow at \nthe ambient temperatures and thus restricts the depth range of the overlying mobile layer), \nunderplated at the base of the crust.  In the case of the Colorado Plateau, which consolidated \nin the Early Proterozoic, the layer of mafic underplating was apparently emplaced at that time \n(e.g., Wendlandt et al., 1993). The age of the mafic underplating beneath the Ukrainian Shield \nis much less clear; some or all of it may represent the cumulative effect of subsequent mantle \nplume magmatism, such as that associated with the Devonian rifting in the Dnieper Basin \n(e.g., Chekunov et al., 1992; Wilson and Lyashkevich, 1996). Thick layers of mafic \nunderplating, up to ~20 km, are commonly identified at the base of Early to Middle \nProterozoic crust  from seismic wave velocities (e.g., Durrheim and Mooney, 1991, 1994), \nPage 33; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nwhich is thus often ~40-50 km thick. A thin mobile lower-crustal layer may thus be \ncharacteristic of such regions, leading to complex patterns of vertical crustal motion such as \nthose observed in the Ukrainian Shield (Fig. 2c and d) and the Colorado Plateau (Fig. 11).  \nThe idea that crustal rheology, inherited from the ancient geological past, affects rates of \npresent-day vertical crustal motion is not new; it also underpins the work of others, such as \nthe \u2018lithospheric memory\u2019 hypothesis of Cloetingh et al. (2005).  However, as noted above, \nthe observed vertical motions are here explained as consequences of coupling between surface \nprocesses and induced lower crustal flow, rather than being consequences of plate boundary \nforces, as Cloetingh et al. (2005) believed.  The fluvial database reviewed here shows several \nexamples of areas that are clearly unaffected by convergent plate motions, as required by the \nCloetingh et al. hypothesis, and yet have river terrace sequences that record surface uplift. \nExamples are the Shoalhaven in Australia (Fig. 15), the Sundays in South Africa (Fig. 13) and \nthe Colorado in the western USA (Fig. 11), none of which is near a recent convergent \nboundary; indeed the Colorado adjoins the actively extending Basin and Range Province.   \n4.1. Climatic forcing of terrace formation \nThe discussion will now explore the usefulness of the new (IGCP 449) data resource for \nexamining the role of climatic fluctuation in river terrace formation.  Uplift alone could \nperhaps have brought about terrace formation, particularly if it had taken the form of sporadic \nbursts of vertical movement interspersed with periods of stability (cf. Matoshko et al., 2004).  \nTerraces that can be attributed to individual earthquake events are only to be found in plate \nboundary zones, however, where faults have very high slip rates (e.g. Leland et al., 1998).  \nThe minimal role of fault movement in accommodating lateral variations in uplift generated \nby lower crustal flow has been discussed elsewhere (Westaway, 2006b). Examples are known \nwhere slip on intraplate active faults is superimposed onto regional uplift, but this results in \nminor warping of terraces rather than the formation of additional features (e.g. Krzyszkowski \net al., 2000; Westaway et al., 2006a). \nEven without climatic triggering or sporadic uplift pulses, channel diversion as a result of \navulsion, meander cut-off or capture could have resulted in terrace formation in areas of \nprogressive elevation.  Indeed, the weakly separated terraces of the Pravara and Kukadi \nsystems of the Deccan plateau, India (Fig. 3a, b), appear to have resulted from shifts in the \nfluvial courses rather than progressive incision\/aggradation cycles (cf. Westaway et al., 2003).  \nPage 34; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nShifting channels are always necessary, of course, for terraces to form; in uplifting regions, if \nchannels remain fixed (e.g. in areas of highly resistant bedrock) the result is a deeply incised \nnarrow valley or gorge, with minimal terrace preservation (as in Fig. 1b).  Terraces formed by \nshifting channels will be localized, however, rather than traceable over large parts of \ncatchments, as in the example terrace sequences used to illustrate this paper.  \nThe most important support for climatic forcing of terrace formation comes from empirical \nevidence in those sequences in which palaeoclimatic indications are well preserved.  This \nnormally means fossils, although sedimentological and pedogenic (including cryogenic) \nevidence is of considerable importance in some instances.  The evidence often indicates a \nclimatic periodicity closely matching the cyclicity of the terraces.  Examples of this are the \ncold-warm-cold sequences of the lower Thames (above; Fig. 4) and the consistent occurrence \nof interglacial beds capping the terraces of the Somme (Fig. 5).  In systems for which a \nrelationship with climatic fluctuation cannot be demonstrated, this is generally because \nevidence for variable palaeoclimate is rare or absent.  In the absence of fossils or pedogenesis, \nthe warm parts of climatic cycles will be difficult to demonstrate, even if they are represented \nwithin the sedimentary sequence.  Clear records of interglacial climate frequently coincide \nwith limestone bedrock and consequent calcareous ground water, which enable preservation \nof vertebrate and molluscan fossils and can even lead to travertine precipitation during \nclimatic optima, as in the Wipper and other rivers of central Germany (Mania, 1995) and \nthose of northern France (Antoine and Limondin-Lozouet, 2004; Antoine et al., in press).  In \nregions where such evidence exists, it seems reasonable to use the records from areas of \noptimal preservation as analogies.  In this way the spacing of terraces and their relation to less \nfrequent dating points, such as glaciations or even the well-documented narrowing of valleys \nfollowing the \u2018Mid-Pleistocene Revolution\u2019 (see above), can be used to compare with \nsequences elsewhere.  Invariably the sequences with the best palaeoclimatic evidence will \nalso be the best dated, on the basis of biostratigraphy, the various dating methods that use \nfossils as raw material or even from basic climato-stratigraphy.  Exceptions to this occur in \nvolcanic areas, where lavas and ash deposits interbedded with fluvial sequences can be dated \nby radiometric means (e.g. Pastre, 2004; Westaway et al., 2005, 2006b; Maddy et al., 2005).  \nIn addition, there is an increasing number of systems in which OSL dating has been applied to \nfluvial sands (e.g. Jain et al., 1999, 2004; Jain and Tandon, 2002; Briant et al., 2006) and ESR \ndating of fluvially transported quartz grains has been successfully employed in France \n(Antoine et al., 2003, in press; Despri\u00e9e et al., 2004; Antoine and Limondin-Lozouet, 2004). \nPage 35; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nAs noted, the idea that river terraces have been climatically generated is long established \n(Zeuner, 1945; Bourdier, 1968), although it fell out of favour during times when terrestrial \nsequences were viewed in terms of over-simplified climato-stratigraphical models (e.g. \nattempts to explain the post-Anglian Thames sequence in terms of only two climatic cycles \u2013 \ncf. Bridgland, 1994; Gibbard, 1994).  With the recognition of nine 100 ky cycles since the \n\u2018Mid-Pleistocene Revolution\u2019, the potential for matching river terraces to climatic forcing is \nconsiderable.  Detailed studies of fluvial activity during the last climatic cycle have revealed \nthe importance of climate as a forcing factor (e.g, Macklin et al., 2002; Howard et al., 2004), \ndespite such records being variably compromised by anthropogenic influences.  It is therefore \nclear that cyclic changes in climate would be capable of driving terrace formation, given \nbackground uplift.  This leaves more sophisticated questions to be explored, such as which are \nthe most important parts of climatic cycles in terms of fluvial activity, whether all rivers \nrespond in the same way, whether (as has always seemed likely) there are differences between \nclimatic zones and whether humidity\/precipitation, rather than temperature, can be the key \nfactor in some cases. \nIt has already been noted that some rivers have cut down, forming new terraces, at cold-to-\nwarm transitions, whereas others seem to have deepened their valleys following interglacials.  \nIt has also been noted that, whereas sequences exist with an approximate one-to-one match \nbetween terraces and glacial-interglacial (Milankovitch 100ky) cycles, there are many others \nwith fewer terraces than this.  A ready explanation exists for these records; the rivers have \npresumably responded only to the more significant climatic cycles, perhaps those identified \nby Kukla (2005) as supercycles.  A good example is Kukla\u2019s (1975, 1977) own record from \nthe River Svratka, Czech Republic.  Rivers with more terraces than 100 ky cycles are rarer.  \nThe Somme (Fig. 5) has just one extra terrace, formed during MIS 7(b) (Antoine, 1994; \nAntoine et al., 2000), as does the Yonne, a Seine tributary (Chauss\u00e9 et al., 2004).  Another \nexample is the Maas, for which an additional terrace has been attributed to MIS 13(b) \n(Westaway, 2002b).  The Solent, mentioned above, has several extra terraces, perhaps \nachieving nearly two per 100 ky cycle during the late Middle Pleistocene (Westaway et al., \n2006a).  These examples are all from uplifting crustal areas in proximity to the Atlantic, the \nlatter factor perhaps bringing the climatic sensitivity that has led to this type of extreme \nresponse. \nPage 36; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \n4.2 Differences between climatic zones \nThe differing patterns of terrace preservation from the four eastern European rivers discussed \nabove (Fig. 2), located within the temperate climatic zone, are important for showing that \ncrustal type, rather than climate, is the key factor influencing the disposition of fluvial \nsedimentary archives.  This is especially true since the cited examples of cratonic stability, \nnamely in India, southern Africa and western Australia (Westaway et al., 2003; Fig. 3), are in \nwarmer regions.  There are several uncertainties involved in extrapolating explanations of \nterrace formation from cooler temperate regions to warmer climatic zones.  These relate to the \npotential role, in the climatic forcing of fluvial activity, of permafrost (or more especially, its \nmelting) and to whether fluctuations of temperature or precipitation are the most influential or \nwhether other processes restricted to warmer climates might also be important.  Indeed, \nfollowing B\u00fcdel (1977, 1982), a view emerged that river terraces have not formed in the \ntropics, perhaps because these areas have not experienced the cold\/periglacial \u2013 \nwarm\/interglacial fluctuations.  The emphasis on such fluctuations in many explanations of \nterrace formation (Tyr\u00e1\u010dek, 1983; Bridgland, 1994, 2000; Wymer, 1999) would seem to \nsupport B\u00fcdel\u2019s view.  Data from IGCP 449 and earlier studies, however, have shown that \nterrace sequences are indeed present between the tropics, important examples occurring in the \nsystems of the River Tana in Kenya (latitudes ~0-2\u00b0 S; Veldkamp et al., 2004; in press), the \nRiver Niger in eastern Mali and southern Niger (~12-16\u00b0 N; e.g., Beaudet et al., 1981; Dubois \net al., 1984; Oussini and Morel, 1989; Bergoeing and Gilliard, 1997) and the various South \nAmerica examples mentioned above.  B\u00fcdel may have been misled, in formulating his views, \nby basing his impressions of tropical landscapes predominantly on his observations of \ncratonic areas such as Amazonia and the Archaean Congo Craton of central Africa, where the \nabsence of terraces can now be seen to be the result of crustal stability rather than climatic \nregime. \nThe role of temperature as the control on Late Cenozoic fluvial activity may seem counter-\nintuitive, given the importance of precipitation, through its effect on discharge, in riverine \nprocesses.  The importance of temperature, however, is first its influence on vegetation cover, \nwhich dictates the level of slope stability and thus bedload supply, and second its role in the \nperiodic growth and decay of permafrost. In both respects this influence might be expected to \ndecline with decreasing latitude, with lessening of the severity of the cold parts of climate \ncycles.  However, there are indications that temperature is a controlling factor in areas well \nPage 37; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nbeyond the reach of the Quaternary glaciations; it has, for example, been invoked as \nsignificant in the Mediterranean region (Macklin et al., 2002; Martrat et al., 2004).  The \nrelation between the interglacial marine terraces of NW Syria and the fluvial terraces of the \nKebir has already been noted (above) as evidence that the latter formed during cold stages, \nwhich implies that temperature can be the dominant influence as far south as the \nMediterranean regions.  A further important question is whether global temperature and \nhumidity fluctuations during the Quaternary have been in phase (cf. Nanson et al., 1992); if \ntemperature and humidity have been covariant during the last climatic cycle in Europe, their \nindividual effects will be difficult to isolate. \nIt is generally believed that Quaternary temperature fluctuations have been considerably less \nsevere in lower latitudes, although Milankovitch-driven fluctuations in humidity provide an \nalternative triggering system in such areas.  Examples of terrace sequences in tropical regions \nfor which aridity\/humidity cycles are envisaged as principal forcing factors include the \nAmazon, in Brazil (Latrubesse et al., 1997), and the Niger, in the Niger Republic (e.g. Dubois \net al., 1984; Oussini and Morel, 1989).  Some systems in temperate regions might also be \nmore susceptible to fluctuations of humidity, with its effect on discharge and vegetation \ndensity, than of temperature.  Indeed, this type of forcing has been invoked for the eastern \nMediterranean, where it has been linked to fluctuations in the strength of the Indian Ocean \nmonsoon (e.g., Rossignol-Strick, 1985, 1999; Kroon et al., 1998).  Similarly, aridity\/humidity \ncycles are believed to be of considerable importance in Australia, set against a background of \nincreasing aridity since the mid-Pleistocene (cf. Nanson et al., 1992, 1995, 1998). \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe IGCP data confirm that aggradational river terraces, which dominate the long-timescale \nQuaternary fluvial record worldwide, result from the combined effects of progressive surface \nuplift and the cyclic climatic triggering of fluvial activity.  Vertical disposition patterns vary \naccording to crustal province rather than climatic zone, despite the importance of climatic \nfactors and their influence, via vegetation, on landscape stability and, therefore, sediment \nsupply.  Previous received wisdom that terraces have not formed in the tropics is wrong; they \noccur wherever there is relatively young uplifting crust, although the climatic triggering may \ndiffer in contrasting climatic zones and may be stronger in some than in others.  Another \nPage 38; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nimportant difference between terrace records is in the numbers of terraces per climate cycle.  \nMid-late Quaternary systems with more than, less than and approximately one terrace per 100 \nky cycle can all be observed.  Where there are fewer terraces than cycles, it is likely that only \nthe major events are represented; where there are more it is uncertain whether forcing is \nrelated to MIS subcycles or to both cooling-limb and warming-limb forcing.  In sequences \nwith just one terrace per 100 ky cycle, the varying stratigraphical position of interglacial \nsediments within individual terrace \u2018treads\u2019 suggests that examples exist of both warming- \nand cooling-limb forcing of incision.  Despite the importance of precipitation in controlling \nfluvial processes, it would seem that temperature fluctuations are the key forcing factor, with \nthe role of varying humidity yet to be demonstrated. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper represents a contribution to IGCP 518 \u2018Fluvial sequences as evidence for \nlandscape and climatic evolution in the Late Cenozoic\u2019.

The Terrace record from the River Rhine; the numbers in circles refer to marine \noxygen isotope stages (MIS) during which each terrace aggradation is inferred to have \nculminated. (a) Longitudinal profile showing terraces of the Middle and Lower Rhine, \nbetween the uplifting Rhenish Massif and the subsiding coastal region of the Netherlands. \nAdapted from Westaway (2001, Fig. 10) and Westaway (2002b, Fig. 6), who listed original \nsources of information. (b) Transverse profile across the Middle Rhine near Koblenz, showing \nthe transition from a broad floodplain in the Early Pleistocene to a narrow gorge lacking \nterraces (after Bibus and Semmel, 1977; Westaway, 2002a).  Abbreviations: HT \u2013 \nHauptterrasse (high terrace); MT \u2013 Mittelterrasse (middle terrace); NT \u2013 Niederterrasse (low \nterrace); TR \u2013 Terrasse (terrace; in the reach upstream of Koblenz). \nFig. 2. Fluvial records from the East European Plain (after Matoshko et al., 2002, 2004): a  - \nlocation map, showing the key crustal blocks mentioned in the text; b - generalized transverse \nprofile through the Middle\u2013Lower Dniester terrace sediments; c - transverse profile, ~240 km \nlong, across the Middle Dnieper basin, ~100 km downstream of the city of Kiev; d- transverse \nprofile through the deposits of the Upper Don near the city of Voronezh; e - cross-section \nthrough the sediments of the Lower Volga, in the region of the Pre-Caspian Block (see part a).   \nNote the contrasting disposition of deposits of particular ages in each case.  White numbers in \nblack circles refer to marine oxygen isotope stages to which deposits are attributed.  The \nconsiderable width of the Middle Dnieper basin (c) means that different deposits overlie \ndifferent crustal types.  For further information and source references see Matoshko et al. \n(2002, 2004). \nFig. 3. Transverse profiles illustrating fluvial sequences in cratonic regions (after Westaway \net al., 2003). Sections a and b are from the cratonic part of peninsular India, being records \nfrom the rivers Pravara and Kukadi, respectively. Sections c and d are from the River Vaal, in \nthe Archaean Kaapvaal craton of South Africa: c - after De Wit et al. (1997); d \u2013 detail of the \nyounger part of the record, after Helgren (1978). In c, the Wedburg and Proksch Koppie \ngravels are thought to be Miocene (e.g., de Wit et al., 1997) and the oldest deposit known in \nthe succession, the Nooitgedacht gravel, is thought to date from the Late Cretaceous or early \nin the Cenozoic (e.g., de Wit, 2004). Of the three \u2018Younger Gravel\u2019 members in d, A and B \nare thought to be Early Pleistocene, whereas C is biostratigraphically dated to the mid-Middle \nPleistocene. In the Riverton Formation, Members I and II have yielded Acheulian artefacts \n(Middle Pleistocene); Member III has yielded Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, suggesting a late \nMiddle Pleistocene or early Late Pleistocene age; and Members IV and V are Holocene (cf. \nWestaway et al., 2003). See, e.g., Dingle and Hendey (1984) for further discussion of the \nCenozoic evolution of the Vaal river system and Butzer et al. (1973) for more detail on its \nfluvial deposits. \nFig. 4. The Thames terraces (after Bridgland 1994 with subsequent modifications), showing \nMIS correlations (? = inferred). a - Idealized transverse section through the terraces of the \nMiddle Thames, ~35 west of London, where the most complete sequence is preserved; b - \nIdealized transverse section through the terraces of the Lower Thames, ~15km east of \nLondon, showing interbedded cold- and warm-climate deposits; this sequence, which begins \nwith the Anglian (MIS 12) glacial diversion of the river, shows optimal preservation of \npalaeoclimatic evidence. See, e.g., Bridgland and Schreve (2001, 2004) or Bridgland (2006) \nfor details of biostratigraphic and archaeological age-control for these deposits. \nFig. 5. Transverse section through the terraces of the River Somme, in the vicinity of Amiens, \nPage 51; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nnorthern France (after Bridgland et al., 2006; Antoine et al., in press), showing MIS \ncorrelations (? = inferred).  \nFig. 6. Model for terrace formation in response to climatic forcing: a - original model from \nBridgland (2000), with downcutting at warming transitions; b - revised model, with \ndowncutting at both warming and cooling transitions (after Bridgland, 2001); c - third \npossible scenario, newly added here, with downcutting at cooling transitions to match rivers \nsuch as the Somme (Fig. 5; see text).  \nFig. 7. Schematic transverse profile through the staircase of terraces of the lower River Aguas \nin the Vera Basin, SE Spain (adapted from Schulte et al. (2000); Schulte (2002)). Inferred \nMIS correlations are shown. \nFig. 8. Comparison of uplift rates deduced from different terrace records: (a) and (b) long-\ntimescale (post-3.5 Ma) and short timescale (post-1.3 Ma) records for the Middle Thames \n~45km west of London, after Westaway et al. (2002; cf. Fig. 4a). (c) and (d) long- and short \ntimescale records for the Somme at Amiens (Fig. 5). (e) and (f) long- and short timescale \nrecords for the Middle Rhine at Andernach (Fig. 1). (g) long-timescale (7.5 Ma) record from \nthe Aguas (Fig. 7), also including the Early Messinian, Early Pliocene and Pleistocene marine \nsediments in the same region; (h) long-timescale (6 Ma) record from the Middle Dniester \n(Fig. 2b). Modelling solutions use the technique of Westaway (2001; Westaway et al., 2002); \nsee also Westaway (2002a, c). Filled symbols indicate preferred fits between observed terrace \nheights and model predictions; open symbols indicate other possible ages for individual river \nterraces. All solutions assume   \u03ba (thermal diffusivity of the crust) 1.2 mm2 s-1.  \nModel parameters are: Wi=zi-zb, where zi is the depth at which the lower-crustal flow is \nconcentrated and zb is the depth of the base of the brittle upper crust (Westaway, 2001; \nWestaway et al., 2002), which is taken at the temperature threshold Tb=350\u00b0C. u is the \ngeothermal gradient in the lower crust. \u2206Te and to are the magnitude and start timing of each \nphase of LCFF (see Westaway et al., 2002, for full explanations). For the viscosity \nparameterization used for the mobile lower crust, with a temperature-dependent linear viscous \nrheology, and for an assumed uniform steady-state geothermal gradient, the depth zi is \nroughly 9\/10 of the way down from zb to the depth zm of the Moho (Westaway, 1998). As \nnoted previously (e.g., Westaway, 2002b), the thicker the mobile lower-crustal layer is \nassumed to be, the larger Wi is, and thus the more sluggish is the predicted uplift response to a \ngiven phase of lower crustal flow forcing (LCFF). (a) and (b) use Wi=8 km, u=10 \u00b0C km\n-1, \nto1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-6.0 \u00b0C, to2=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te2=-3.4 \u00b0C, to3=0.9 Ma and \u2206Te3=-2.0 \u00b0C. Observed \nuplift is measured relative to the present-day river level of 18 m a.s.l., except for the marine \nRed Crag deposit, the present-day altitude of which used to indicate uplift since its deposition \n(i.e., palaeo-water depth and any fall in global sea-level are both neglected). (c) and (d) use \nWi=9 km, u=20 \u00b0C km\n-1, to1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-6.0 \u00b0C, to2=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te2=-2.9 \u00b0C, to3=0.9 Ma and \n\u2206Te3=-2.9 \u00b0C. Reference level used for measuring uplift is +2 m, a.s.l., 1 m below the top of \nthe Valley Bottom gravel. (e) and (f) use Wi=10 km, u=20 \u00b0C km\n-1, to1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-9.0 \u00b0C, \nto2=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te2=-4.5 \u00b0C, to3=0.9 Ma and \u2206Te3=-11.5 \u00b0C. Observed uplift is measured from a \nreference level of 67 m a.s.l., 7 m above the present river level. (g) uses Wi=11 km, u=20 \u00b0C \nkm-1, to1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-10.0 \u00b0C,  to2=6 Ma, \u2206Te2=-16 \u00b0C, to3=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te3=-2 \u00b0C, to4=0.9 Ma \nand \u2206Te4=-3 \u00b0C.  To convert fluvial incision to uplift, a channel lengthening correction of \n+100 m has been applied linearly between 3100 ka and 950 ka (MIS 25). Observed uplift is \nmeasured from a reference level 3 m above present river level (for river terraces) and from \npresent sea-level (for marine terraces). (h) uses Wi=8 km, u=20 \u00b0C km\n-1, to1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-\n22.0 \u00b0C, to2=5.7 Ma, \u2206Te2=-1.5 \u00b0C, to3=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te3=-0.7 \u00b0C, to4=2.0 Ma, \u2206Te4=-2.2 \u00b0C, \nPage 52; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nto5=0.9 Ma and \u2206Te5=-3.7 \u00b0C. Observed uplift is measured from 1 m below the present river \nlevel at Serebriya, Ukraine, which is 60 m above the level of the Black Sea. The top of the \nSarmatian \u2018marine\u2019 sediment is at ~330 m a.s.l., which is assumed to represent ~300 m of \nuplift and ~30 m of eustatic sea-level fall. This sediment is assumed to have an age of 10.6 \nMa, at the Sarmatian-Meiotian boundary. To link this to the later fluvial record, a 60 m \nchannel-lengthening correction is applied at a uniform rate between 10.6 Ma and 5.3 Ma. \nFig. 9. The sequence in the Upper Orontes valley: (a) Location map; (b) Idealized transverse \nsection through the Orontes terraces in the Homs area (modified from Bridgland et al., 2003). \nBases of terraces and other field relations are shown dashed if not directly observed. Numbers \nin circles indicate MIS correlations. Terrace and archaeological evidence from the Middle \nOrontes (Besan\u00e7on and Sanlaville, 1993; Dodonov et al., 1993; Muhesen, 1993) is shown, for \ncomparison, to the left of the main staircase. There has been ~400 m of total incision by the \nOrontes since the eruption of the Homs Basalt, which took place in the latest Miocene \n(Messinian; ~6-5 Ma; see Westaway, 2004 for a summary of the dating evidence).  \nFig. 10. Representative transverse profile across the terraces of the River South Platte, near \nDenver, Colorado (modified from Osterkamp et al., 1987), showing MIS correlations (? = \ninferred). Age constraints are from Osterkamp et al. (1987), as amended by Gansecki et al. \n(1998), Lindsey et al. (1998), Dethier et al. (2001), Schildgen et al. (2002) and references \ncited therein. The start of incision below the level of the \u2018Late Miocene \/ Early Pliocene\u2019 \nerosion surface can be dated to ~5 Ma from the end of deposition, in adjacent regions, of \nsediment (of the Ogallala Group) that is derived from this erosion (e.g., McMillan et al., \n2002). The Nussbaum terrace gravel is correlated with other deposits (e.g., the Blanco \nFormation of the southern High Plains) with a fauna sssigned to the Blancan mammal \nassemblage zone. Correlative sites underlie calcrete capped by the Guaje ash, from the ~1.6 \nMa eruption of Valles Caldera in New Mexico. This gravel thus probably dates from the early \nEarly Pleistocene. The Rocky Flats terrace gravel, of \u2018Nebraskan\u2019 age, is capped by well-\ndeveloped palaeosol thought to record at least two interglacials. It is tentatively dated to ~1.35 \nMa from the extent of soil development and to up to ~1.5 Ma using cosmogenic 10Be; it \nprobably represents the later part of the Early Pleistocene. The deposits of the Verdos terrace \ncontain ash from the 602\u00b14 ka Lava Creek B eruption of Yellowstone, with a well-developed \n\u2018Yarmouth\u2019 palaeosol. The gravel forming this terrace thus probably aggraded during MIS 16. \nThe deposits of the Slocum and Louviers terraces have yielded uranium series dates on bone \nof 190\u00b150 ka and 129\u00b110 ka, respectively. Both are capped by palaeosol characteristic of the \nSangamon (MIS 5e) interglacial. The gravels forming these terraces thus probably aggraded \nduring MIS 8 and MIS 6, respectively. The deposits forming the Broadway terrace date from \nthe Pinedale (MIS 2) glaciation. Those of the Piney Creek alluvium are Holocene, and those \nof the post-Piney Creek alluvium are late Holocene, with radiocarbon dates of <1 ka.  \nFig. 11. Idealised transverse profile through the terrace staircase of the Colorado River and its \nmajor tributary, the Gunnison, in the vicinity of Grand Junction, Colorado. Numbers in circles \nare interpreted MIS correlations. Data have been derived from localities up to ~150 km apart, \ncompiled from the following sources (see Fig. 12): Hansen (1987), Baker et al. (2002), Bryant \net al. (2002), Scott et al. (2002), Garhart et al. (2003), Kellogg (2004) and Karlstrom (2005). \nNumerical ages are from Ar-Ar dating. Note phases of major incision in the Late Miocene, in \nthe Late Pliocene and starting in the early Middle Pleistocene. There is of course no guarantee \nthat in the earliest of these phases, incision served as a direct proxy for uplift; early in the \ndevelopment of other large river systems, incision significantly exceeded contemporaneous \nuplift (e.g., Westaway, 2002b). The possible association of the ~600 ka Yellowstone Lava \nPage 53; Bridgland & Westaway; 18\/03\/2008 \nCreek B ash with the 250 m Colorado terrace is the highest of a range of possibilities \nindicated by Karlstrom (2005); this ash may correlate in his view with as recent a terrace as \nthat at 190 m, whereas according to Scott et al. (2002) its equivalent may be the 165 m \nterrace.  \nFig. 12. Modelling solution for the uplift history revealed by the Colorado River system in the \nvicinity of Grand Junction, Colorado. Altitudes above the present river level are converted \ndirectly to estimates of uplift. Model prediction, using the same technique and notation as \nFigure 8, is based on the following parameter values: Wi=6 km, u=10 \u00b0C km\n-1, \u03ba=1.2 mm2 s-1, \nto1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-1.0 \u00b0C, to2=10 Ma, \u2206Te2=-11.6 \u00b0C, to3=6 Ma, \u2206Te3=+1.2 \u00b0C, to4=3.1 Ma, \n\u2206Te4=-7.2 \u00b0C, to5=2.5 Ma, \u2206Te5=+4.2 \u00b0C, to6=2.0 Ma, \u2206Te6=-2.2 \u00b0C, to7=1.2 Ma, \u2206Te7=+1.0 \n\u00b0C, to8=0.87 Ma, and \u2206Te8=-7.5 \u00b0C. (a) Uplift history since 11 Ma. (b) Enlargement showing \nthe record since 3.5 Ma. (c) Enlargement showing the record since 1.4 Ma. (d) History of \nvariation of uplift rate. Sources of data are indicated. The possible alternative correlations of \nthe Yellowstone Lava Creek B ash with Colorado terraces, indicated in Figure 11 caption, \nwould necessitate lower values of Wi to account for the high rates of incision and uplift \nrequired in the early Middle Pleistocene.  \nFig. 13. Terraces of the River Sundays, South Africa: (a). location map (b). Schematic \ntransverse profile across the terrace staircase at Kirkwood, Eastern Cape province, South \nAfrica (modified from Hattingh and Rust, 1999). Suggested MIS assignments are shown, \nbased on incision\/uplift modelling (see Fig.  14). \nFig. 14.  Uplift modelling of the Sundays terrace staircase at Kirkwood, as illustrated in \nFigure 13b, and of the staircase of marine terraces bounding the adjacent Indian Ocean \ncoastline. Inferred MIS correlations are shown. Observed uplift is measured from present \nriver level, which is 50 m above sea-level. A +50 m correction has been applied to Sundays \nterrace T1 to account for post-depositional downstream channel lengthening. Display format \nis the same as in Figure 8, except round symbols mark marine deposits. Marine terraces \n(after Hattingh and Rust, 1999) are labelled with M followed by the height a.s.l. in metres; \nthus M240 means the ~240 m a.s.l. terrace. Prediction uses Wi=8 km, u=20 \u00b0C km\n-1, \u03ba=1.2 \nmm2 s-1, to1=18 Ma, \u2206Te1=-10.0 \u00b0C, to2=3.1 Ma, \u2206Te2=-11.2 \u00b0C, to3=0.9 Ma and \u2206Te3=-5.5 \n\u00b0C.
