These descriptors include \nphysiographic and climatological parameters and may involve geologically or \nhydrogeologically related parameters. A hydrogeological characteristic of catchments \nthat has been the focus of a number of studies, particularly in the context of modelling \nungauged catchments, is Base Flow Index (BFI). BFI is the long-term ratio of \nbaseflow to total stream flow and thus represents the slow or delayed contribution to \nriver flow and may be influenced to a significant extent by catchment geology. \nHowever, to date the relationship between catchment geology and BFI has not been \nquantified in a systematic manner. Even though there is a tacit assumption that the \nunderlying geology influences baseflow, previous studies that estimate BFI typically \nsimplify the effect of catchment geology to a parameter that represents the fractional \narea of aquifers in a catchment (Nathan et al., 1996; Sefton and Howarth, 1998; \nMwakalila et al., 2002; Mwakalila, 2003; Abebe and Foerch, 2006; Santhi et al., \n2008). Some studies have adopted a slightly more refined approach to include a \nnumber of discrete geologies as physical catchment descriptors (Nathan and \nMcMahon, 1990b; Lacey and Grayson, 1998; Mazvimavi et al. 2005), and, rather than \nuse the areas of aquifers or different lithologies as catchment descriptors, Haberlandt \net al. (2001) used the physical properties of the aquifers (effective porosity and \nsaturated hydraulic conductivity). However, because, in addition to geological \nparameters, all these studies use non-geological parameters to estimate baseflow or \nBFI they cannot provide specific insights into the relationships between the geological \ncharacteristics of catchments and baseflow or BFI. The motivation for this study is to \nexamine geological controls on BFI independent of other catchment factors. \n \nA streamflow hydrograph describes the variation in the rate of flow of a \nstream with time and consists of four basic elements: direct surface runoff, interflow, \ngroundwater flow or baseflow (Nash, 1960; Hall, 1968; Nathan and McMahon, \n1990a; Eckhardt, 2008), and channel precipitation. In most hydrograph analyses, \ninterflow and channel precipitation are grouped with direct runoff (unless there is a \nneed to explicitly treat them independently) and the total runoff hydrograph is made \nup of the sum of surface runoff and discharge from saturated groundwater storage or \nbaseflow (Nathan and McMahon, 1990a; Viessman and Lewis, 2002). The baseflow \ncomponent of the hydrograph represents longer-term (weeks to months) changes in \nthe regional groundwater head and flow system and typically varies in response to \nrelatively long seasonal changes in saturated groundwater head driven by seasonal \nchanges in factors such as evapotranspiration (Wittenburg and Silvapalan, 1999). BFI \nis defined as the difference in area under the baseflow hydrograph and total runoff \nhydrographs obtained by baseflow or hydrograph separation (Institute of Hydrology, \n1980).  There are a variety of graphical or manual methods of baseflow separation. \nFor example, Viessman and Lewis (2002) describe five methods and Eckhardt (2008) \nhas recently compared seven different automated methods. In each case the separation \nmethods are designed to separate the fast component of flow from the slower \nbaseflow component by identifying the onset of rising limbs in the total stream \nhydrograph and the end of direct surface runoff towards the end of a local peak in the \ntotal stream hydrograph. Regardless of the details of the method used, and as Eckhardt \n(2008) notes, since the true values of the baseflow index are always unknown it is not \npossible to identify which of the methods provides the \u2018best\u2019 estimates of BFI. \n 2\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nGeological information, along with other variables, has been correlated with \nBFI using a range of approaches including: multiple linear regression techniques \n(Nathan et al., 1996; Lacey and Grayson, 1997; Mwakalila et al., 2002; Mazvimavi et \nal., 2005; Abebe and Foerch, 2006), neural network methods (Mazvimavi et al., \n2005), and regional landscape mapping (Santhi et al., 2008). The fractional area of \naquifers, or in some cases specific lithologies, typically shows some correlation with \nBFI. Lacey and Grayson (1997) demonstrated that there was a strong relationship \nbetween the combined geology-vegetation groups and BFI, but suggested that the \ngroups also represented other factors such as climatic history, recharge capacity and \ntransmissivity. Mazvimavi et al. (2005) found that geology was not a significant \npredictor of BFI in their study area, but concluded that this was due to groundwater in \ncertain formations in their study area (several catchments in Tanzania) being \nrelatively deep and disconnected from surface streams. \n \nSoil data has also been used extensively in studies of baseflow and BFI in \nungauged catchments as a surrogate for the underlying geology. The Institute of \nHydrology low flow study developed the \u2018hydrology of soil types\u2019 (HOST) \nclassification to estimate flow duration and flow frequency parameters (Gustard et al., \n1992; Boorman et al., 1995). It consists of a grouping of soil associations into classes \nbased on physical properties of soils and on their hydrogeological setting. \nMultivariate regression of soil type data against BFI data for representative \ncatchments in the United Kingdom produced continuous BFI catchment \ncharacteristics scaled on continuous soil parameters, referred to as BFIHOST (Gustard \net al. 1992; Boorman et al., 1995). The BFIHOST methodology and data have been \nused successfully in a number of studies (Boorman et al., 1995; Sefton and Howarth, \n1998; Dunn and Lilly, 2001; Lee et al., 2005; Marechal and Holman, 2005; Young, \n2006). \n \nThe present study uses a similar approach to BFIHOST, in that geological \nassociations are grouped into classes, based on lithological or hydrogeological \ncharacteristics, which are then correlated with observed BFI. However, unlike the \nprevious studies, including BFIHOST, where the aim was to build robust predictive \nmodels using sometimes very limited information, the central task of the present study \nis to quantify as fully as possible the relationship between geological or \nhydrogeological characteristics of an area and observed BFI independent of any other \nfactors. This is possible in the Thames Basin because high quality geological mapping \nand river flow data are available. In this study, linear regression models have been \nused to quantify geological controls on BFI by correlating detailed 1:50000 scale \ngeological mapping with BFI values for catchments with diverse geological and \naquifer characteristics at the basin scale (~10000 km2). There are two complementary \naims for the work described in this paper. The first aim is to investigate if physically \nmeaningful relationships between lithological characteristics of catchments and BFI \ncan be quantified at the basin scale using regression methods. The second aim is to \nshow how a geologically-based model of BFI can be used to produce continuous BFI \ncatchment characteristics in a similar manner to BFIHOST. The models have been \napplied to the Thames Basin, UK, as a case-study. The approach, however, is not \nbasin specific and the methodology description and discussion include generic \nobservations related to the application of regression modelling to the quantification of \ngeological controls on baseflow regardless of basin hydrology or geology.  \n  \n 3\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nSTUDY AREA \nThe Thames Basin, defined by the catchment of the River Thames and its tributaries, \nis situated in the south east of the United Kingdom (Figure 1a). For the purposes of \nthis study the Thames Basin is defined by the Environment Agency\u2019s Thames River \nBasin District (Environment Agency, 2007). The source of the River Thames is in the \nCostwolds in Gloucestershire. The length of the river down to Teddington Lock, in \nwest London, is approximately 235 km, and the area of the Basin is about 16100 km2. \nTeddington Lock is the lowest flow gauging station on the River Thames and marks \nthe non-tidal limit of the river. Mean annual rainfall varies across the Thames Basin \nfrom about 600 to 900 mm and the mean flow at Teddington Lock is about 78 m3s-1 \n(Natural Environment Research Council, 2003).  \n \nThe Thames Basin is underlain by a thick sequence of Mesozoic to Recent \nrocks that can be divided into three broad zones based on geological structure: the \nMidlands Shelf to the northwest; the London Basin in the central area; and the \nWealden Anticline to the southeast (Figure 1b), each with their own characteristic \nlithostratigraphy. The Midlands Shelf consists of a sequence of Jurassic rocks \n(including oolitic limestones and clays), Cretaceous and Palaeogene rocks (including \nthe Upper Cretaceous Chalk, the major aquifer in the Basin) are exposed in the \nLondon Basin, and a Lower Cretaceous sequence of clays and sands outcrop in the \nstructurally distinct Wealden Anticline in the southeast of the Thames Basin. \nPalaeogene to Recent surficial deposits can be found throughout the Thames Basin \nacross all three of the structural zones. \n \nThe western parts of the Thames Basin are predominantly rural, whereas, the \nhighly urbanised area of Greater London is located in the central and eastern part of \nthe Basin and is home to about 13 million people. Just over 40% of public water \nsupplies in the Basin, equivalent to ~2.25 million m3\/d, come from groundwater, \nmainly from the Chalk aquifer. \n \nThere is a long history of investigations into the water resources of the Basin \nand the system is highly regulated. However, there is only one basin-wide study of the \nrelationships between groundwater and surface water in the peer-reviewed literature \n(Andrews, 1962).  Andrews (1962) investigated, at a basin scale, the geological \ncontrols on the nature of groundwater discharge to the Thames above Teddington \nLock. For example, based on expressions for natural recession of groundwater \ndischarge at Teddington Lock and at Days Weir, Andrews was able to show that the \nrate of groundwater flow at Days Weir diminishes 1.7 times faster than at Teddington \nLock. From gaugings above Days Weir, Andrews estimated that the yield per unit \narea of the Jurassic limestones is about 25% higher than that from the Chalk, but that \nthe limestones give up water more quickly and the summer and autumn discharges fall \nbelow those from the Chalk. \n \nMODEL METHODOLOGY  \nThree least squares regression models  are described in this paper. Two related step-\nwise multiple linear regression models, Models 1a and 1b, have been developed to \nquantify the relative influence of the fractional areas of lithostratigraphic classes on \nobserved BFIs. A third model, Model 2, has been developed to investigate whether \nregression models based on an alternative hydrogeologically-based classification \nscheme can be used to produce continuous characteristics, similar to BFIHOST, that \n 4\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nadequately predict BFI across the Thames Basin. The lithostratigraphic and \nhydrogeological classification schemes (Table 1) for all regression models were \ndeveloped and selected iteratively as part of the regression modelling process as \nillustrated schematically in Figure 2. The following sections describe how the \ncatchments were selected; how the BFI data used in the study was obtained; how the \ngeological and hydrogeological parameters used in the regression models were \nderived, and finally; the regression techniques that were used. The steps in the model \nmethodology referred to in this section relate to the numbered steps shown in Figure \n2. \n \nSelection of catchments  \nBased on information for available gauging stations in the Thames Basin (Natural \nEnvironment Research Council, 2003), 154 catchments were initially selected for use \nin this study. The successful identification of multivariate relationships between \nstream flow characteristics, such as BFI, and catchment characteristics requires good \nquality data from catchments where the flow regimes are relatively natural (Gustard et \nal 1992). However, this is particularly problematic in a basin like the Thames Basin \nwhere artificial influences and anthropogenic stresses and impacts, such as river \nregulation measures, river and groundwater abstraction, conjunctive use schemes and \neffluent discharge to rivers are locally significant. Consequently, the 154 catchments \nwere screened to remove those with poor quality records and or significant \nanthropogenic influences. The screening criteria developed for the Institute of \nHydrology low flow estimation programme for the United Kingdom (Gustard et al, \n1992) have been used to identify the sub-set of catchments for the regression \nmodelling.  \n \nFollowing this screening, 44 relatively \u2018natural\u2019 catchments with good or \nadequate quality flow data were identified to be used to calibrate the regression \nmodels. The location of these catchments is shown in Figure 1a. The remaining 110 \ncatchments have been used to validate Model 2. The 44 calibration catchments cover \n~7800 km2, equivalent to about 48% of the area of the Thames Basin, their areas are \napproximately log-normally distributed, and they range in size from 12 to 1016 km2 \nwith a geometric mean of ~103 km2. Based on a multi-scale typology classification \nsystem for groundwater-surface water interaction developed by Dahl et al (2007), the \ncatchments in this study broadly fall into a \u2018landscape type\u2019 category, where \ngroundwater flow systems are assumed to be influenced primarily by regional \ngeomorphology, hydrogeological setting and aquifer structure and heterogeneity \nrather than specific riparian zone processes.  \n \n BFI data \nBFI data were taken from the Hydrometric Register for the United Kingdom (Natural \nEnvironment Research Council, 2003). BFI was calculated using the UKIH method \n(Gustard et al., 1992; Natural Environment Research Council, 2003). In this method, \nfor each stream hydrograph minima in five-day non-overlapping consecutive periods \nare identified and then searched for turning points. The turning points are connected \nto obtain the baseflow hydrograph which is constrained to equal the observed \nhydrograph ordinate on any day when the separated hydrograph exceeds the observed. \nBFI is then calculated as the ratio of the volume beneath the baseflow line between \nthe first and last turning points. BFI is based on a separation of the entire record for a \nflow gauge where typical flow records are greater than five years (Natural \n 5\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nEnvironment Research Council, 2003). Piggott et al. (2005) have suggested minor \nimprovements to the Institute of Hydrology procedure that take into account effects \nassociated with different starting points for the analysis of the five-day non-\noverlapping periods and the calculation of values of baseflow that exceed \ncorresponding values of stream flow. The differences in BFI estimates using the \nInstitute of Hydrology method and the revised method of Piggott et al. (2005) are \nrelatively small (typically up to 5% of baseflow) and the average of the difference is \napproximately zero.  As these errors are small, the published Institute of Hydrology \nBFI data have been used in this study (Natural Environment Research Council, 2003). \nTable 2 shows summary statistics for the BFIs for the 44 catchments used to calibrate \nthe regression models.  \n \nIdentification of geological and hydrogeological parameters \nThe lithostratigraphic classification scheme for Models 1a and 1b and the \nhydrogeological classification scheme for Model 2 are both based on the same \n1:50000 scale digital geological map of the Thames Basin. The geological data were \ntaken from the British Geological Survey\u2019s 1:50000 scale digital geology data set of \nthe United Kingdom (British Geological Survey, 2008). The map shows >200 named \nunits exposed at the land surface in the Thames Basin (step 1), many of which are \nlocal units that cover only a few square kilometres, such as local river terrace (sand \nand gravel) deposits. Consequently, it was necessary to reduce the number of \ngeological classes to ensure that the regression models were tractable, while at the \nsame time allowing a sufficient number of geological classes to characterise the \ngeological and hydrogeological diversity of the Thames Basin. The geological classes \nwere grouped based on expert judgement (step 2). The following approach was used: \n \n\uf0b7 Define a target for the number of lithological classes. In the case of the present \nstudy an initial target of 20 to 30 lithological classes was set (to be broadly \ncomparable with the 29 classes used in the BFIHOST scheme Gustard et al., \n1992; Boorman et al., 1995). \n\uf0b7 Group the 1:50000 geology classes into internally consistent lithologies based \non prior knowledge of the degree and nature of lithological variability in the \nBasin. For the purposes of this study, internally consistent was taken to mean \nthat at least 85% or more of the class by area consisted of a similar lithotype \nbased on the expert judgement of a hydrogeologist. \n\uf0b7 Because the Thames Basin consists of a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks \nwith no intrusive rocks, and because there is no major faulting in the Basin at \nsurface, the classes could be based on the stratigraphic column and the \nhydrogeologist started the grouping exercise with the oldest formations and \nworked progressively up the stratigraphic column. As a consequence, \nstratigraphically neighbouring groups had to be lithologically distinct. In \npractice this meant that stratigraphically alternating chronologically distinct \nunits dominated by alternating carbonate, clay and sandstone lithologies were \nidentified. \n\uf0b7 Two hydrogeologists were independently set the task of grouping the \nlithologies. The two lithological classification schemes were then compared. \nThere were trivial differences between the two classification schemes which \nwere then reconciled through discussion to produce the final lithological \nclasses. \n \n 6\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nThis process resulted in 19 lithological classes being identified consisting of 15 \nclasses of consolidated deposits and 4 classes of surficial deposits (step 3) shown in \nFigure 1b. Table 1 gives a brief description of the main geological and \nhydrogeological features of each the 19 lithological classes. \n \nBased on the initial lithostratigraphic classification, preliminary data analysis \nwas undertaken before the development of the regression models (step 4). Pearson \ncorrelation coefficients were calculated to check for any significant correlations \nbetween lithological classes and to characterise the relationships between the \ndependent and independent variables used in the regression. No transformations were \napplied to any of the independent variables. As a result of this preliminary data \nanalysis, eight lithological classes were rejected from inclusion in regression Models \n1a and 1b and two classes were combined. \n \nEight geological classes (Bracklesham, Corallian, Gault, Gravels, Lias, \nPortland and Purbeck, Thanet and Clay-with-Flints) were rejected as they showed no \nconsistent correlation between BFI and their catchment fractional areas due to the \nvery limited number of catchments that contained these classes, or because two or \nmore classes showed significant correlation, but the classes could not be combined \ndue to significant lithological differences. In addition, two classes (the Greater and \nInferior Oolites) were combined as they showed weak correlation (Pearson correlation \ncoefficient of 0.57) are stratigraphically adjacent and show some hydrogeological \nsimilarity. Consequently, following the preliminary data analysis, 10 lithological \nclasses were left for use in Models 1a and 1b (step 5). \n \nThe rationale for the hydrogeological classification was to start with the \nsimplest scheme and to increase the complexity of the scheme until a satisfactory \nregression could be developed with adequate predictive capabilities (step 6). The \nsimplest hydrogeological classification scheme is one based on a two-fold \nclassification of aquifer and aquitard (Nathan et al., 1996; Sefton and Howarth, 1998; \nMwakalila et al., 2002; Mwakalila, 2002; Abebe and Foerch, 2006). When models \nwere built with either aquifer or aquitard fractional areas as the independent variable \n(both could not be used in the same regression as the two variables are co-correlated) \nthey only explained about 70% of the variation in BFI (step 7).  The next step (step 8) \nwas to increase the number of hydrogeological classes to a number that would be \nsignificant in a regression model but would also enable independent variables to be \nidentified. The aquifers were divided into aquifers where fracture flow is dominant \n(e.g. limestone aquifers) and aquifers where intergranular flow is dominant (e.g. \nconsolidated sandstone aquifers). The justification for this was that it was assumed \nthat differences in the permeability and storage structure of these two types of aquifer \nmay be usefully discriminated in the regression model. It was hypothesised that on \naverage there may be more storage available in the intergranular aquifers compared \nwith fractured aquifers, but that these aquifers would drain more slowly due to their \nrelatively lower hydraulic conductivity. The aquitards were divided into two classes: \nthin relatively non-permeable surficial deposits, and consolidated aquitards. Again, \nthe justification for this distinction was that the two types of aquitard may show \nsignificantly different storage, hydraulic conductivity and drainage characteristics. \n \nThe 19 lithological classes were then mapped onto the four hydrogeological \nclasses using expert judgement. This was a trivial task since, as noted previously, due \n 7\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nto the simple sedimentary sequence in the Basin the lithostratigraphic classification \nhad given rise to chronologically distinct units dominated by alternating carbonate, \nclay and sandstone lithologies and there was clear correspondence with the four \nhydrogeological classes. Table 1 shows how the initial 19 lithological classes (defined \nat step 3) have been mapped onto four hydrogeological classes: low permeability \nsurficial deposits, aquitards, intergranular aquifers, and fractured aquifers at step 8.  \nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the four hydrogeological classes \nto test the degree of independence of the variables used in the regression. There were \nno significant correlations between hydrogeological classes. The spatial distribution \nof the four hydrogeological classes in the Thames Basin is shown in Figure 3.  \n \nBFI may be expected to correlate with the fractional volume of the \nhydrogeological classes within a catchment. However in the absence of a detailed 3-D \ngeological model of the Basin, once the lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological classes \nhad been identified, as a surrogate for fractional volume, the fraction by area of the \nclasses in each of the 44 catchments was estimated using a GIS. Table 2 shows \nsummary statistics for the fractional area data for the final 10 lithological classes used \nin regression Models 1a and 1b (step 5) and for the four hydrogeological classes used \nin regression Model 2 (step 9).  \n \nRegression methodology  \nAn initial multiple least square regression model was built using the lithostratigraphic \nclassification for the ten lithological classes (step 10) using the 44 calibration \ncatchments. This regression model had an adjusted squared multiple R value of 0.85 \nand a standard error of estimate of 0.086. However, a number of the coefficients were \nnot significantly different from zero. So a stepwise regression model, Model 1a (step \n11), was built based on the ten independent lithological classes. Parameters were \nremoved during stepwise regression where their coefficients were not significantly \ndifferent from zero at 90% confidence level. Jackknife (leave one out) resampling was \nperformed on the result of the stepwise regression model, Model 1a, to investigate the \nsensitivity of the model to individual cases (catchments). Based on the results of the \nModel 1a jackknife, a further model, Model 1b (step 12), was built using the same \ngeological classes as used in Model 1a, but with one lithological class (the Lower \nGreensand) removed. Model 2 was built by regressing data for the four \nhydrogeological classes onto the BFI data (step 9) using the 44 calibration \ncatchments. A jackknife (leave one out) was performed on Model 2. In addition, \nbootstrap re-sampling (random resamples from the observed data) was performed on \nModel 2 to characterise the distribution of model coefficients and to assess usefulness \nof the coefficients for predictive modelling. Statistics from the regression coefficients \nobtained from the bootstrap resampling of Model 2 were used as the basis for Monte \nCarlo simulations to predict confidence bounds for the model predictions. Model 2 \nwas validated using the 110 catchments assessed as being \u2018variably impacted\u2019 during \nthe catchment selection process. \n \nRESULTS \nTables 3a, 3b and 3c show the results for the regression models, Model 1a, 1b and 2 \nrespectively. Figure 4 shows modelled values of BFI plotted against observed BFI for \nthe forty-four calibration catchments for Models 1a, 1b and 2. It also shows the \ndistribution of residuals for Models 1a, 1b and 2 as a function of the modelled values \nof BFI. \n 8\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nModel 1 \nModel 1a shows that six of the ten lithological classes: Diamicton, Chalk, \nLower Greensand, Thames, Weald Clay, and Oolites as well as the regression \nconstant, have coefficients significantly different from zero. Model 1a explains about \n88% of the variance in BFI in the 44 catchments with a low residual standard error \n(0.085) associated with the model (Table 3a). Figure 4 shows the good correlation \nbetween modelled and observed BFI using Model 1a. However, jackknife (leave one \nout) resampling of Model 1a indicated that the model may be sensitive to the Lower \nGreensand variable in one particular case. A co-efficient for Lower Greensand of \n0.107 was obtained in one case during jackknife resampling when the mean and \nstandard deviation of the coefficients for Lower Greensand for the jackknife samples \nare 0.226 and 0.021 respectively. Consequently, a second regression model, Model 1b \n(Table 3b), was built with the Lower Greensand variable removed to see if this \nproduced an improved model. Model 1b explains a similar level of variance in BFI \n(88%) to Model 1a with a similar low residual standard error (0.088), it also shows a \ngood correlation between the modelled and observed BFI (Figure 4).  \n \nPlots of residuals for Models 1a and 1b qualitatively show homoscedasticity \n(Figure 4), there is no significant autocorrelation present in the residuals, and the \nresiduals are broadly normally distributed. One-way Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on \nthe distribution of the residuals shows normal distributions with probabilities of 0.79 \nand 0.95 for Models 1a and 1b respectively. In summary, both models have the same \nadjusted squared multiple R value while Model 1a has a slightly lower residual \nstandard error than Model 1b. Although jackknife results for Model 1a indicate that it \nmay be sensitive to a single anomalous class (catchment) associated with a high \nfractional area of Lower Greensand, removal of the Lower Greensand variable does \nnot change the overall form or performance of the regression (Figure 4). \n \nModel 1 validation \nThe regression constants from Model 1a and Model 1b, 0.64 and 0.69 respectively \n(Tables 3a and 3b), are representative values of BFI for the 44 catchments used in the \ncalibration, while the coefficients of the lithological classes in the regression models \nindicate the degree of departure from this typical value of BFI due to each geological \nclass. The values for the constants of the two models are consistent both with the \nmean value for the 44 catchments used in the calibration (0.65) and with the BFI at \nTeddington Lock (0.64), the lowest gauge in the Basin. It is inferred from the \nsimilarity between the model constants and observed mean BFI value and the value \nfor BFI at Teddington Lock that the regression models have some physical meaning. \nThis is supported by the observation that the significant lithological classes in the \nmodels, the signs of their coefficients and the relative magnitudes of the coefficients \nare all consistent with an understanding of the hydrogeology of the Basin. \n \nTen lithological classes were used as the input for the stepwise regression \n(Model 1a) and six classes, Diamicton, Chalk, Lower Greensand, Thames Clay, \nWeald Clay, and Oolites, were found to be significant. These lithological classes \ncover just over 50% of the area of the Basin (about half of the remaining area is \ncovered by thin shallow deposits such as sands and gravels ~10%, alluvium ~9%, and \nthe Clay-with-Flints ~5%) and include the Chalk, the most important aquifer in the \nBasin (Allen et al 1997, Jones et al 2000), as well as two other major aquifers, the \nOolites, and, in Model 1a, the Lower Greensand. They also include the single most \n 9\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nextensive aquitard in the Basin, the London Clay (part of the \u2018Thames\u2019 lithological \nclass, Table 1). The signs and magnitudes of the coefficients for each of the \nlithological classes in Models 1a and 1b are consistent with their hydrogeological \ncharacteristics. The Chalk and Oolite classes have positive coefficients as would be \nexpected of aquifers, while the Diamicton, Thames and Weald Clay classes represent \naquitards and have negative coefficients. The Chalk co-efficient is greater than that \nfor the Oolites and this is consistent with the observations of Andrews (1962) that \ngroundwater discharges from the Jurassic Limestones above Days Weir yield water \nmore quickly than the Chalk in the Lower Thames. It is interesting to note that \nDiamicton is identified as having a significant negative co-efficient in Models 1a and \n1b. Diamicton is not a regionally significant aquitard, such as the London Clay and \nthe Weald Clay. It is a stiff, brown, yellow and grey mottled sandy clay glacial till that \ncovers mainly Chalk in the north east of the Basin, Figure 1b. Although it only \nreaches a maximum thickness of ~25m (Millward et al., 1987), the clay content of \nDiamicton appears to be sufficiently high to contribute to relatively low values of BFI \nin catchments where it is present. \n \nIf, as assumed, the regression models have some physical meaning, it should \nbe possible to correlate the regression coefficients with aquifer properties for each of \nthe lithological classes. Baseflow may be expected to scale with a parameter such as \nhydraulic diffusivity, D   (K\/SS, where K is hydraulic conductivity and SS is specific \nstorage). Since hydraulic conductivity is likely to range over many orders of \nmagnitude, but specific yield for aquitard and aquifer materials typically ranges from \n0 to ~0.3 (Freeze and Cherry, 1979), as a first approximation hydraulic conductivity is \na good surrogate for hydraulic diffusivity and is an appropriate parameter to attempt \nto correlate with the regression coefficients.  \n \nEach geological class will have a range of hydraulic conductivities depending \non the scale of observation (Neuman, 1990) and heterogeneities in their pore \nstructure, fabrics and larger-scale lithological variations (e.g. Anderson, 1997). For \nthe purposes of this study we have considered the range of hydraulic conductivities \nthat could be expected as derived from a typical pumping test or at the river reach \nscale (i.e. a scale of 10s m to 100s m)  for each geological class. Table 5 lists \nrepresentative values for hydraulic conductivity for each of the geological classes with \nnotes on how the representative values were inferred. Hydraulic conductivity data \nfrom the Thames Basin is available for the Chalk, Lower Greendsand, Oolites and \nThames classes. Representative values for Diamicton and Weald Clay have been \ntaken from Freeze and Cherry (1979, Table 2.2). \n \n Figure 6 is a plot of these representative values of hydraulic conductivities \nagainst the regression coefficients for each of the geological classes in Model 1a. Note \nthat in Model 1a the coefficients for the Lower Greensand and the Oolites are almost \nidentical as are their inferred representative hydraulic conductivities so the two points \nplot effectively on top of each other. The hydraulic conductivity of the Chalk is \nknown to be relatively high in valleys and low under interfluves (Allen et al., 1997). \nThis has been represented by the range bar for the Chalk in Figure 6.  The large range \nbars on the hydraulic conductivity of the Diamicton and Weald Clay represent the \nrange of values for the respective lithologies taken from Freeze and Cherry (1979, \nTable 2.2) with the representative value being taken as the median of the range. \n 10\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nFigure 6 shows that there is a positive linear relationship between the regression \ncoefficients and log10 hydraulic conductivity for the geological classes in Model 1a. \n \nIf the regression coefficients in Models 1a and 1b indicate the degree of \ndeparture from the typical or basin wide value of BFI represented by the constant \nterms in the regressions, the hydraulic conductivity associated with a regression \ncoefficient of zero in Figure 6 may represent a class-independent value of hydraulic \nconductivity for a basin. Based on Figure 6, a representative hydraulic conductivity in \nthe range of 10-5 to ~10-9 m\/s can be inferred for the Thames Basin as shown by the \nrange of values defined by the dashed lines. This value is consistent (albeit towards \nthe lower end of the range) with representative values for aquifers i.e. 10-1 to 10-8 m\/s \n(Manning and Ingebritsen, 1999, Figure 1), for estimated basin scale values of \nhydraulic conductivity, e.g. 10-7 to 10-11 m\/s (Willet and Chapman, 1989; Deming, \n1993), and for modelled values of \u2018equivalent hydraulic conductivity\u2019 of \nheterogeneous sedimentary sequences, e.g. 10-7 to 10-8 m\/s  (Zhang et al., 2007). \nConsequently,  Figure 6 is taken as further support for the assertion that Models 1a \nand 1b have physical meaning. \n  \nModel 2 \nRegression Model 2, Table 3c, shows that the coefficients for all four \nhydrogeological classes are significantly different from zero and that the model \nexplains about 97% of the variance in BFI in the 44 catchments. A jackknife resample \nof Model 2 showed that the model is not sensitive to any particular cases. Figure 4 \nshows a good correlation between modelled and observed BFI based on Model 2. \nResiduals from Model 2 qualitatively show homoscedasticity (Figure 4), there is no \nsignificant autocorrelation in the residuals, and the residuals are broadly normally \ndistributed. A one-way Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the residuals indicates a normal \ndistribution with a probability of 0.76. In addition, no spatial correlation was seen in \nthe distribution of the residuals for the cases (catchments across the Basin). \n \nBootstrap statistics were generated for the regression coefficients in Model 2 \nbased on 10000 bootstrap samples each with 44 cases. Table 4 gives summary \nstatistics for the results from the bootstrap resampling of Model 2.  Confidence \nbounds have been calculated for the modelled BFI data for Model 2 based on the \nbootstrap statistics. Assuming a normal distribution for each coefficient and using the \nmean and standard deviation of each coefficient from the bootstrap resampling, Monte \nCarlo simulations were performed, based on 10000 simulations for each case \n(catchment), to produce a distribution of predicted BFI values. Figure 4 shows the \nconfidence bounds on the modelled values of BFI based on 95%tile and 5%tile values \nfor the Monte Carlo simulations using the bootstrap statistics. The range in predicted \nBFI values for a given case is relatively small (typically 0.05), and there is no \nsignificant correlation between width of the confidence bands and the observed BFI, \nindicating the robustness of Model 3 for predictive purposes. \n \nModel 2 validation \nAs a validation of Model 2, BFI predicted using the hydrogeological \nclassification scheme can be compared with BFI calculated using BFIHOST for the \n44 calibration catchments (Marsh and Hannaford, 2008). Figure 5 is a plot of \npredicted BFI against observed BFI for the respective models. It shows that there are \nno systematic differences in the range or magnitude of predicted BFI between the two \n 11\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nmodels across the range of observed BFIs. In addition, linear regressions through the \npredicted and observed data for each model have similar slopes and that the 90% \nconfidence bounds for the two regression overlap (Figure 5), although BFIHOST \nsystematically predicts slightly lower BFIs by about 0.06. From these observations, it \nis inferred that predictions of BFI based on the Model 2 hydrogeological classification \nscheme (this study) and BFIHOST are comparable and that Model 2 performs as well \nas BFIHOST as a predictive tool. \n \nUnlike Models 1a and 1b, Model 2 provides continuous BFI catchment \nestimates scaled on the independent hydrogeological parameters (in a similar manner \nto BFIHOST, Gustard et al., 1992; Boorman et al., 1995). Because the four \nhydrogeological classes cover the whole of the Basin the model calibrated using the \n44 baseline catchments, can be used to predict BFI values for the remaining 110 \ncatchments in the Thames Basin. If, as has been assumed, the 44 catchments used for \ncalibration of Model 2 are largely un-impacted by anthropogenic effects then the \ndegree of deviation of observed BFI from modelled BFI in the other 110 catchments \nin the Thames Basin should be a function of exogenous factors not related simply to \ncatchment hydrogeology, including anthropogenic factors. Any systematic deviations \nof observed from modelled BFI that can be correlated with non-hydrogeological \nfactors would provide additional validation for the regression model. \n \nFigure 7 shows predicted BFI, based on Model 2, as a function of observed \nBFI for the 110 catchments in the Thames Basin. As expected, there is a wider scatter \nof predicted values for the 110 catchments compared with the 44 calibration \ncatchments (Figure 5) due to both poorer quality flow records and a range of artificial \ninfluences and anthropogenic stresses and impacts on baseflow. Despite the larger \nscatter in predictions, there is still a good positive correlation between predicted and \nobserved BFI and this correlation can be used to identify outliers. Based on the \ndifference between observed and modelled BFIs, outliers have been identified as \nbeing either greater than or less than one standard deviation of the mean difference, \nFigure 7. The cases where observed BFI is higher than modelled BFI indicate that \nthere is an apparent excess of baseflow above that which would be expected under \nnatural conditions. Conversely, the cases where observed BFI is lower than modelled \nBFI indicate that the river has lower baseflow than that which would be expected \nunder natural conditions. But do these outliers show systematic relationships with any \nanthropogenic factors or other characteristics of the catchments? Land cover data are \navailable for the catchments, including urban coverage (Centre for Ecology and \nHydrology, 2008; Marsh and Hannaford, 2008), and for this study percentage urban \narea of the catchments has been taken as a surrogate for the degree of anthropogenic \nimpact on the catchments. Figure 8 is a plot of observed BFI as a function of urban \narea for the two classes of outliers identified in Figure 7. For catchments where the \nobserved BFI is significantly higher than the modelled BFI there is a good negative \ncorrelation over a wide range of BFIs, but there is no similar correlation between \nobserved BFI and urban area for catchments where observed BFI is less than the \nmodelled BFI. \n \nA number of studies have shown that urbanisation may cause increased \nsurface runoff in annual streamflow including an increased magnitude of peak runoff \n(Chin and Gregory, 2001; Rose and Peters, 2001; Burns et al., 2005). However, Burns \net al. (2005) in a study of the effects of suburban development on runoff generation \n 12\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nalso noted that baseflow during dry periods was greatest in high-density residential \ncatchments and attributed this to discharge of septic tank effluent through the shallow \ngroundwater system to streams. Because the negative correlation between observed \nBFI and urban area (for catchments where BFI is higher than expected) identified by \nthis study holds over a wide range of absolute values of BFI and urban area, a single \nfactor is unlikely to influence this relationship. Consequently, it is inferred from \nFigure 8 that a number of factors may contribute to the \u2018excess\u2019 observed baseflow \nthat could include sewage discharge, mains leakage, and leakage from septic tanks. \nHowever, it is clear from Figure 8 that factors directly associated with urbanisation \nare not related to the catchments that show unexpectedly low values of BFI. These \ncatchments are mainly rural (<20% urban area), sometimes relatively small (on \naverage ~75km2) and most are highly impacted by groundwater abstraction. Some are \naffected by sewage discharges and a few of them have notably poor flow records \n(Marsh and Hannaford, 2008). A combination of these and possibly other factors must \naccount for their anomalously low values of BFI.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nGeological controls on BFI \nBy regressing fractional areas of discrete lithologies within catchments onto BFI and \nby demonstrating that the resulting regression models have some physical meaning, \nthis study has shown that BFI can be considered as an integrated expression of the \nfractional areas of discrete lithologies within catchments. This can be done because \nonly geological factors were considered during model calibration enabling the role of \ngeology to be quantified independent of other factors. However, it has previously \nbeen demonstrated, using a variety of methods, that other parameter sets, including \ntopographic, soil, vegetational and climatic factors (Nathan et al., 1996; Sefton and \nHowarth, 1998; Mwakalila et al., 2002; Mwakalila, 2003; Abebe and Foerch, 2006; \nSanthi et al., 2008), can explain observed variations in BFI equally well. How can \nthese observations be reconciled? \n \nLacey and Grayson (1998) note that \u2018geology affects baseflow in at least two \nways. The first effect is direct: groundwater is stored in rocks \u2026 and this contributes \nto baseflow. The second effect is the formation of soil: different types of rocks tends \nto produce different types and depths of soil \u2026 and hence differences in recharge, \ngroundwater and baseflow\u2019. However, the interrelationships between geology and \nother catchment parameters are likely to be far more complex than described by Lacey \nand Grayson (Tetzlaff et al., 2008). The underlying lithological characteristics of a \ncatchment certainly effect the nature and depth of soils, but these in turn can influence \nvegetation type, land cover and land use. The underlying lithological characteristics of \nthe catchment will affect long-term weathering and hence physiographic \ncharacteristics of the catchment and this in turn will effect soil and veretation \ndevelopment and may even influence to some small extent the distribution and \nmagnitude of precipitation across the catchment. A combination of all these \ninteractions will influence the nature and extent of recharge to the aquifer and all \nthese factors and interactions will have a bearing on baseflow and BFI as an empirical \nmeasure of baseflow. Given the above, it is reasonable to conceptualise the underlying \ngeology in catchments, as characterised by lithological variations and the associated \nvariations in hydraulic and storage characteristics of those formations across a \ncatchment, as a primary factor in affecting baseflow and BFI. However, because of \nthe complex interrelationships between different catchment parameters it is not \n 13\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \npossible to simply say that a measure of one parameter set, e.g. a geology or soils \nindex, is responsible for a given percentage of the variation in BFI.   \n  \nA generic methodology \nIt has been shown that regression methodologies can be used to describe physically \nmeaningful relationships between litholgical characteristics of catchments and their \nassociated BFI in the Thames Basin (Models 1a and 1b), and that a regression model \nrelating hydrogeological characteristics of catchments to BFI (Model 2) can be used \nto produce continuous BFI catchment characteristics with useful predictive \ncapabilities for the Thames Basin (in a manner similar to BFIHOST). The details of \nthe methods used in this study are specific the Basin, however, the generic approach \nhas a wider application to other basins. \n \nFor models based on a lithological classification scheme the first step is to \nidentify the lithological classes to be used in the step-wise regression models. In this \nstudy we used an expert judgement approach, although, depending on the type and \nquality of geological mapping information available, statistical techniques such as \ncluster analysis could be used to help inform the initial classification scheme prior to \nregression modelling. This step could even be removed by using an all possible \nsubsets regression approach to entirely automate the regression process. Where an \nexpert judgement approach is used, this study shows that it is helpful to have explicit \ntargets (number of classes), assessments undertaken by independent workers to \ncompare resulting initial lithological classification schemes, and rules appropriate to \nthe basin and stratigraphic sequence being assessed. The target for the initial number \nof lithological classes may be limited by the available geological mapping. For \nexample, the British Geological Survey has published three digital geological maps \nthat cover the Thames Basin at 1:625000, 1:250000 and 1:50000 scales. The 1:50000 \nscale map was used as this gave the best resolution to the geological linework when \nestimating fractional areas of geologies in different catchments. The 1:625000 \nmapping shows 17 lithological classes in the Thames Basin. If this had been the only \nmapping available then the first step, to identify the lithological classes to be used in \nthe regression, would not have been needed as all the mapped units at 1:625000 could \nhave been used in the stepwise regression, but the model would less accurately \nrepresent the fractional areas of the different lithological classes. \n \nThe particular rules used by the independent workers to establish the expert \njudgement-solicited initial lithological classification are particular to the Thames \nBasin, but a generic approach can be identified. As previously noted, because the \nBasin consists of a sequence of sedimentary rocks the classes was be based on the \nstratigraphic column, and, as a consequence, stratigraphically neighbouring groups \nhad to be lithologically distinct. This scheme is broadly applicable, however, for other \nbasins in other geological and tectonic settings, for example, where there are major \nfaults that cut-out sections of the stratigraphy or where there are intrusive units, the \nsimple grouping of  stratigraphically neighbouring units into lithologically coherent \nclasses is not possible. In this case the hydrogeologists need to develop specific rules \nrelated to the grouping of units associated with faulting or intrusions. For the Thames \nBasin lithological classes were defined on the degree of internal coherency of \nlithology. For sequences that are faulted or contain intrusions then similar \nconsiderations can apply except that stratigraphically-, lithologically- and structurally-\nbased grouping schemes could be developed and combined.   \n 14\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nFor the regression models based on a hydrogeological classification scheme it \nis necessary to identify hydrogeologically representative classes that are continuous \nover the entire basin. In this study we developed the most simple classification \nscheme for which a satisfactory regression could be developed with adequate \npredictive capabilities. This entailed identifying four hydrogeologicaly distinct classes \nand mapping the lithological classification onto those units. Because the lithological \nclassification for the Thames Basin had produced a series of chronologically distinct \nunits dominated by alternating carbonate, clay and sandstone lithologies the task was \ntrivial. An alternative more generic approach would be to use standard \nhydrogeological mapping conventions (UNESCO, 1983) to identify  the \nhydrogeological classes. This may give more than the four hydrogeological classes \nused in this study, but would enable a similar regression model to be built. \n \nSUMMARY  \nDespite a common assumption that underlying geology in catchments influences \nbaseflow, to date the relationship between catchment geology and BFI has not been \nquantified in a systematic manner. In this study, relationships between lithological \ncharacteristics of catchments and BFI are quantified at the basin scale by multiple \nlinear regression methods using the Thames Basin, UK, as a case-study. Multiple \nlinear regression methods have been used before to relate catchment parameters to \nBFI, however, because these studies used geological and non-geological parameters to \nestimate BFI they cannot provide specific insights into the relationships between the \ngeological characteristics of catchments and BFI. \n \nStandard stepwise multiple linear regression methods are used in this study to \nrelate geological and hydrogeological parameters to BFI. Two similar regression \nmodels have been developed to quantify the relative influence of the fractional areas \nin catchments of different lithostratigraphic classes to BFI, and a second model has \nbeen developed to quantify the relationship between a simple hydrogeological \nclassification scheme and BFI. The latter enables continuous characteristics to be \nmodelled across the Basin, in a manner similar to the BFIHOST methodology. \n \nResults suggest that for linear regression models built using lithological \nclassifications schemes a physically meaningful regression model can be obtained if a \nconstant term is included in the regression. The models have been validated by \ncomparing the regression constant with a BFI value for the outflow stream for the \nwhole basin, and by comparing the regression coefficients for each of the lithological \nclasses with the known hydrogeological characteristics of those lithologies across the \nbasin. The coefficients were found to scale linearly with estimates of log10 hydraulic \nconductivity for each of the lithological classes. \n \nFor a linear regression model built using a simple four-fold hydrogeological \nclassification scheme, the model provides continuous BFI catchment estimates that \nare comparable to those obtained by BFIHOST. The model based on the \nhydrogeological classification scheme was validated using 110 \u2018variably impacted\u2019 \ncatchments in the Thames Basin. Significant deviations between observed and \nmodelled BFI can be explained in part by consideration of an exogenous variable to \nthe model, urban area. For cases, where the observed BFI is significantly greater than \nthe modelled BFI, i.e. for catchments where there is an apparent excess of baseflow, \nthe BFI is negatively correlated with urban area.  \n 15\nBloomfield et al. published in Journal of Hydrology, 373, 164-176  \nThe study has shown that BFI can be considered as an integrated expression of \nthe fractional areas of lithologies in catchments. Previous studies have shown that \nother parameter sets, including topographic, soil, vegetational and climatic factors can \nalso explain observed variations in BFI equally well. Depsite the complex correlations \nand interdependencies between different catchment parameter sets catchment \nlithology can be considered a first order or primary factor in affecting baseflow and \nBFI. \n \nThis study describes an expert judgement approach to selecting the initial set \nof geological parameters to be used in the stepwise linear regression models. The \napproach is generic, and can be applied to basins with a range of geological and \nstructural settings, however, other statistical methods could easily be substituted to \nobtain the initial geological parameters. For the regression models based on a \nhydrogeological classification scheme it is necessary to identify hydrogeologically \nrepresentative classes that are continuous over the entire basin. In this study we \ndeveloped the most simple classification scheme for which a satisfactory regression \ncould be developed with adequate predictive capabilities. An alternative more generic \napproach would be to use classes associated with standard hydrogeological mapping \nconventions. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank Milly Lewis and Mike Cheetham for help with the \nlithological classification used in the study and Jenny Cunningham for help with \nspatial data analysis.
