When multiple potential sites of nitra-\ntion exist, tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) methods\nprovide unique tools to locate the nitro-tyrosine(s) pre-\ncisely. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) is a powerful\nMS\/MSmethod, different in its mechanisms to the \u201cslow-\nheating\u201d threshold fragmentation methods, such as col-\nlision-induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multipho-\nton dissociation (IRMPD). Generally, ECD provides more\nhomogeneous cleavage of the protein backbone and\npreserves labile PTMs. However recent studies in our\nlaboratory demonstrated that ECD of doubly charged ni-\ntrated peptides is inhibited by the large electron affinity of\nthe nitro group, while CID efficiency remains unaffected by\nnitration. Here, we have investigated the efficiency of ECD\nversus CID and IRMPD for top-down MS\/MS analysis of\nmultiply charged intact nitrated protein ions of myoglobin,\nlysozyme, and cytochrome c in a commercial Fourier trans-\nform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)mass spectrometer.\nCID and IRMPD produced more cleavages in the vicinity\nof the sites of nitration than ECD. However the total\nnumber of ECD fragments was greater than those from\nCID or IRMPD, and many ECD fragments contained the\nsite(s) of nitration. We conclude that ECD can be used in\nthe top-down analysis of nitrated proteins, but precise\nlocalization of the sites of nitration may require either of\nthe \u201cslow-heating\u201d methods.\nThe significance of tyrosine nitration in proteins has been\nrecognized in a growing number of publications over the past\ndecade.1 This post-translational modification (PTM) is one of\nseveral occurring during oxidative stress caused by radical\nspecies.2,3 It has been linked to such pathological conditions as\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease,4 cardiovascular disease,5 and atherothrom-\nbotic diseases.6 In vivo, the main nitrating agent for this modifica-\ntion is thought to be the peroxynitrite anion (OONO-), formed\nin the reaction of the superoxide anion (O2-\u2022) with nitric oxide\n(NO\u2022). The product of tyrosine nitration is 3-nitrotyrosine with\nthe NO2 group in the ortho-position to the phenol. Other\nnitrating agents can also react with tyrosine and its nitration\nis regarded as a marker for general nitrative stress.1 Impor-\ntantly, tyrosine nitration is a selective process occurring only\nat specific tyrosine residues.1,7,8 Therefore, a full description of\nthe biological processes involving nitrotyrosine requires precise\nknowledge of the nitration site(s) in the protein(s).\nMass spectrometry (MS) provides reliable tools for both\nidentification of nitrated proteins and high-resolution identification\nof PTM sites in the protein. A combination of ESI with online\nseparation of proteins by liquid chromatography (LC-MS) has\nbeen used to identify 3-nitrotyrosine residues in complex protein\nmixtures.8-12 While mass shifts of the peptide fingerprints can\nbe used to identify the nitration in protein segments, only tandem\nMS\/MS experiments are able to provide precise localization of\nPTMs sites on the protein backbone. The mainstream approach\nfor locating the sites of nitration is to obtain mass fingerprints of\nthe peptides from a proteolytic digest of a complex protein mixture\nor an individual nitrated protein and further analyze the peptides\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The\nalternative approach is \u201ctop-down\u201d protein characterization, in\nwhich intact proteins are ionized and subsequently analyzed in a\nmass spectrometer.13-17 The complexity of the resulting mass\nspectra requires a high-resolution technique, such as Fourier\ntransform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry.\nThe key advantage of the top-down approach is that the measured\nmass of an intact protein may be compared with the mass\ncalculated from the known protein sequence, thus providing\ninformation about all the modifications present in the protein and\nretaining connectivity between the modifications. In the case of\nmultiple modifications, several mass peaks related to protein\nisoforms may be present in the mass spectra, and their relative\nintensities provide information on the extent of each of the\nmodifications. MS\/MS fragments of intact proteins can be\nanalyzed to localize the sites of modifications in a similar way to\nthat for peptides from protein digests. The top-down method has\nbeen demonstrated on proteins up to \u223c200 kDa.17 The downside\nof this method is that the time of MS\/MS analysis is longer than\nin the bottom-up approach, due to a much larger number of\nfragmentation channels.\nSeveral MS\/MS fragmentation techniques are available for both\nbottom-up and top-down approaches. \u201cSlow-heating\u201d methods,18 such\nas CID or infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD),19,20 utilize\ndifferent techniques to excite and dissociate molecular ions\nthermally. CID and IRMPD produce heterolytic cleavages of the\namide bonds in the polypeptide chain giving rise to b and y\nfragment ions that contain the N- or C-terminus, respectively.21\nAs thermal methods, they cleave the weakest bonds first. Since\nits introduction in 1998, electron capture dissociation22 (ECD) and\nits sister method, electron transfer dissociation (ETD),23 have also\nbecome popular in MS\/MS studies. ECD is a fast fragmentation\ntechnique whereby cleavage of the peptide backbone occurs\nfollowing low-energy (<0.2 eV) electron capture and the subse-\nquent cascade of intramolecular radical-driven reactions, the\nprecise pathways of which are still of some discussion.24-27 ECD\ncleavage of the N-CR bonds occurs producing mainly N-\nterminus c\u2032 and C-terminus z\u2022 (or c\u2022 and z\u2032) fragment ions.\nOne of the advantages of ECD over the thermal methods is\nthat it provides a more uniform pattern of cleavages along the\nbackbone, with the only exception being cleavage of the\nN-terminal to proline28 and thus leads to greater peptide\nsequence coverage.29,30 Unlike the thermal methods, disulfide\nbridges are efficiently cleaved by ECD of peptides,24 and following\ncapture of a second electron, fragments from the peptide segment\ninside the \u201cdisulfide loop\u201d can be produced. Furthermore, ECD\nfragments retain labile post-translational modifications,31 while\nCID and IRMPD tend to cleave them. Examples of the efficient\nuse of ECD for localizing PTM sites include phosphorylation,32,33\nN- and O-glycosylation,34,35 ubiquitination,36 sumoylation,37 and\nothers. Nevertheless, there have been observations that ECD is\nnot universally efficient for all possible peptide modifications. We\nhave recently demonstrated that addition of nitration to tyrosine\nseverely inhibits the production of ECD sequence fragments in\npeptides.38 A similar effect was reported by the Beauchamp group\nfor benzyl modifications of cysteine which have an electron affinity\n(EA) of g1.00 eV.39 Specifically, 3-nitrobenzylcysteine (EA ) 1.00\neV) and 3,5-dinitrobenzylcysteine (EA ) 1.65 eV), termed \u201celec-\ntron predators\u201d, inhibit peptide backbone cleavage by ECD and\nthe related electron transfer dissociation (ETD) completely.39\nApparently 3-nitrotyrosine, structurally similar to nitrobenzylcys-\nteine, was also acting as an \u201celectron predator\u201d in our ECD\nexperiments. However, we demonstrated that ECD of the triply\ncharged nitrated peptides resulted in some singly charged\nsequence fragments, which may be the products of secondary\nelectron capture.38 That result indicated that top-down ECD of\nintact nitrated proteins may be efficient, as multiple electron\ncapture by multiply charged protein ions usually occurs,24,30 the\nhypothesis which we put to test in this work.\nIn this study we optimize and compare top-down ECD, CID,\nand IRMPD of nitrated proteins: myoglobin, cytochrome c, and\nhen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). Our choice of proteins was due\nto the different behaviors of their un-nitrated forms under ECD.\nPreviously, we have shown that z > 14+ cations of unmodified\n(13) Kelleher, N. L.; Lin, H.

Thus nitrated myoglobin\nrepresents a system where ECD can be affected only by the\npresence of the nitrated tyrosine, while native lysozyme and\ncytochrome c represent systems where ECD efficiency can be\naffected by other modifications in addition to nitration. For\ncomparison, ECD, CID, and IRMPD of reduced and alkylated\nnitrated lysozyme were also carried out. Finally, we compare our\nresults for top-down ECD and IRMPD of these nitrated proteins\nwith our recent results on ECD of peptides containing 3-nitroty-\nrosine.38\nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nMaterials. In this work we used methanol (Fisher Scientific,\nLeicestershire, U.K.), water (J. T. Baker, Deventer, The\nNetherlands), formic acid (Fisher Scientific), nitric acid, diso-\ndium tetraborate, boric acid, sodium nitrite, sodium phosphate,\nsodium chloride, ammonium acetate, and ammonium bicarbon-\nate (Fisher Scientific), dithiothreitol (DTT), and iodoacetamide\n(IAA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, U.K.). Equine skeletal\nmyoglobin, chicken egg lysozyme, and cytochrome c (horse\nheart) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without\nfurther purification.\nPreparation of Nitrated Proteins for MS\/MS Analysis.Our\naim was to prepare nitro-proteins in the state(s) of nitration found\nin vivo. Electrosynthetic modification of proteins has been shown,\nunder various conditions, to oxidize specific amino acid residues\nincluding tyrosine.42-45 Although in vitro chemical nitration may\nperhaps provide larger total yields of modified proteins, it has been\nobserved to be less selective and specific than electrochemical\nnitration. For example, in vitro nitration of lysozyme and cyto-\nchrome c using peroxynitrite46,47 results in combinations of mono-,\nbis-, and tris-nitration, among other PTM modifications, and\ncomplex separation of products is necessary. Furthermore,\nanalysis of tryptic hydrolysates of lysozyme nitrated in vitro by\nmyeloperoxidase revealed that Tyr23\/Trp28 were modified to a\nhigher extent than Tyr20 (specific site of nitration) and additionally\nthat Trp62\/Trp63 were oxidized and nitrated.46 The same residues\nwere also the main targets of peroxynitrite, which also hydroxy-\nlated Trp108\/Trp111.\nDetailed information on our method of electrochemical nitra-\ntion of myoglobin and lysozyme and the protocol for reduction\/\nalkylation of disulfide bonds in lysozyme have been described\npreviously.38,42-44 Briefly, a water-cooled electrochemical cell with\nplatinum electrode (lysozyme and cytochrome c) or boron-doped\ndiamond electrode (lysozyme and myoglobin) was used. After the\nreaction was stopped, myoglobin samples were extensively dia-\nlyzed.38 We estimate that protein loss during dialysis is <10%. No\nfurther LC separation of nitrated proteins from the unmodified\nmyoglobin was carried out. Samples were subsequently freeze-\ndried and stored at -20 \u00b0C for later use. The reaction products\nfrom the electrooxidative nitration of lysozyme were separated\nby fast protein liquid chromatography (LC), and reduction\/\nalkylation of the disulfide bonds was carried out after the LC\nseparation as described previously.43,44 The electrochemical nitra-\ntion of cytochrome c was carried out following the same procedure\nas for lysozyme, but the protein solution was \u223c2.5 less concen-\ntrated than those of myoglobin and lysozyme. The reaction\nproducts from cytochrome c nitration were LC separated using\nthe same mobile phases and gradients as in the case of lysozyme,\nbut the column used was a Hitrap SP sepharose Fast Flow, 5 mL\n\u00d7 5 mL, from GE Heathcare. After LC separation, the fraction\ncontaining proteins was extensively dialyzed against 10 mM\nammonium acetate (pH ) 5.8) and finally concentrated, as\ndescribed previously for lysozyme.43,44\nMass Spectrometry. All tandem mass spectrometry analysis\nwas performed on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT mass spectrom-\neter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Protein\nsamples were buffer exchanged in 49.5\/49.5% of H2O\/CH3OH\nand 1% of formic acid using an Amicon centrifugal filter\ndevice, 3 or 10 kDa cutoff (Millipore). The final concentration\nwas 1-3 \u00b5M for myoglobin and lysozyme, for cytochrome c\nit was below 1 \u00b5M. Samples were directly injected into the\nLTQ FT by use of an Advion Biosciences Triversa Nanomate\nelectrospray source (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, New York)\nat a flow rate of 200 nL min-1. All MS and MS\/MS spectra\nwere acquired in the ICR cell with a resolution of 100 000 at\nm\/z 400. In total, 150-250 microscans (transients) were\naveraged for each fragmentation spectrum. Precursor ions\n(single charge state) were isolated in the linear ion trap\n(LTQ). The automatic gain control (AGC) target was 2 -10\n\u00d7 106 ion counts with maximum fill time of 2 s. The isolation\nwidth for the ions from the samples of unmodified proteins\nand fractions of mono- and bis-nitrated lysozyme was 20-50\nTh (single step isolation). Isolation of the ions of nitrated\nmyoglobin and cytochrome c was achieved in two or three\nsteps in order to exclude the ions of unmodified protein\npresent in the sample. The final isolation width was 10-15\nTh. Narrowing the isolation width below these values lead\nto a serious depletion of the isolated ions and, thus, a much\nsmaller number of fragments detected. However, we used\nnarrower five-step isolation with a final width of 5-10 Th\nfor investigation of neutral losses from nitrated protein ions\nupon ECD. CID was carried out in the LTQ with a normal-\nized collision energy of 9-20%, duration of 30 ms, and Q )\n0.25.

The current\nacross the electrode was \u223c1.1 A. The ECD duration was\n5-10 ms, and the ECD energy was in the range of 2.5-4%\n(corresponding to a cathode potential of -0.275 to -1.775\nV). IRMPD of the protein ions was carried out in the ICR\ncell using a 75 W in-built CO2 laser (Synrad, Mikilteco,\nWashington) for 100 ms. IRMPD energy was measured as\na percent of the maximum (i.e., 75 W). Raw MS data were\nanalyzed by use of Xcalibur 2.05 software (Thermo Fisher\nScientific), where the Xtract program was used for calculat-\ning monoisotopic masses (44% fit factor, 25% remainder).\nProSight PTM (https:\/\/prosightptm.scs.uiuc.edu) was used\nto search for b, y and c, z protein fragment ions in the single\nprotein mode. The mass accuracy for the search was set at\n10 ppm.\nRESULTS\nNitrated Myoglobin. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the\nnitrated myoglobin indicated that both unmodified and mono-\nnitrated proteins with relative ratio of 1:1.25 were present in\nthe sample. Nitration of myoglobin was expected to take place\nat Tyr103.42 MS\/MS of nitrated myoglobin ions was carried\nout for five charge states: 14+, 16+, 18+, 20+, and 22+, Table\n1. For each charge state the total number of fragments from\nECD was greater than that from IRMPD or CID. For each MS\/\nMS method, the number of fragments varied with the charge\nstate but not monotonically. MS\/MS spectra and fragmentation\ndiagrams for the 20+ ions of nitrated myoglobin are given in\nFigure 1. MS\/MS fragmentation diagrams for the 20+ ions of\nunmodified myoglobin are given in Figure S-1 in the Supporting\nInformation. ECD of the unmodified myoglobin produced\nextensive cleavages, while IRMPD and CID resulted in smaller\nnumbers of fragments. CID of unmodified myoglobin produced\nmore fragments than IRMPD (35 versus 26). Nitration resulted\nin a reduction of the total number of ECD fragments (from 84\nto 45), and ECD cleavage sites were located at least 5 residues\nC-terminal and 11 N-terminal to the site of nitration, Tyr103,\nversus two and five residues, respectively, in the unmodified\nprotein, Figure 1a. A decrease in the number of ECD cleavages\naround Tyr103 upon nitration was observed for all charge states.\nIRMPD of the nitrated myoglobin produced cleavages of the\nprotein backbone closer to the site of nitration than ECD,\nFigure 1c. IRMPD produces more fragments than CID from\nthe nitrated protein (25 vs 12), Figure 1c,d. Nitration does not\nseem to have any serious effect on the efficiency of IRMPD\n(26 and 25 IRMPD fragments produced from unmodified and\nnitrated myoglobin, respectively). The number of CID frag-\nments reduced significantly after nitration (35 and 12 fragments\nbefore and after nitration, respectively). The reason for that\nappears to be of the instrumental nature (see the discussion\nbelow). Additionally, our ECD, CID, and IRMPD results all\nconfirm unequivocally that Tyr103, not Tyr146, is the site of\nnitration. However, fewer fragments confirming nitration on\nTyr103 were produced by CID of the 20+ ions than by ECD or\nIRMPD. The same was true for the other charge states.\nNitrated Lysozyme. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the\ntwo LC fractions from lysozyme nitration indicated that one of\nthem contained mostly mononitrated protein and the other\nmostly bis-nitrated protein. MS\/MS of unmodified, mono, and\nbis-nitrated lysozyme was carried out for both nonreduced and\nreduced protein samples. Initial nitration of lysozyme was\nexpected to take place at Tyr23 followed by nitration of\nTyr20.43,44 MS\/MS spectra and fragmentation diagrams for the\nmost abundant charge state, 15+, of reduced bis-nitrated\nlysozyme are presented in Figure 2. Summaries of fragments\nfrom ECD MS\/MS of the 10+ ions of nonreduced lysozyme\nare presented in Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information.\nHigher charge states of nonreduced lysozyme could not be\nobtained with abundances sufficient for MS\/MS investigation.\nMS\/MS spectra and fragmentation diagrams for the 15+ charge\nstate of reduced mononitrated lysozyme are presented in\nFigures S-3-S-5 in the Supporting Information.\nOnly small numbers of fragments could be obtained from ECD\nof nonreduced lysozyme, Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information.\nAs the cleavage of a disulfide bond by ECD results in one of the\ntwo cysteines reduced by the recombined proton,24 the search\nfor ECD fragments from the nonreduced lysozyme was carried\nout assuming a -1 Da mass shift on one of the cysteines from\neach of the four S-S bonds, no mass shift on the other cysteine,\nand vice versa. However, the fragments found indicate that only\nthe Cys6-Cys127 disulfide bond was cleaved by ECD, with Cys6\nbeing reduced. The other disulfide bonds appear not to be cleaved\nby ECD. A total of 13 c\u2032 fragments between amino acid residues\n3 and 20 and only two z\u2022 fragments close to the C-terminus were\nproduced from unmodified native lysozyme, Figure S-2a in the\nSupporting Information. ECD of mono- or bis-nitrated nonre-\nduced lysozyme produces fewer fragments than ECD of unmodi-\nfied nonreduced lysozyme, Figure S-2b,c in the Supporting\nInformation. Furthermore, ECD does not cleave beyond amino\nacid residue 13. Thus ECD cleavages do not reach the site(s) of\nnitration, and none of the ECD fragments contains the site(s) of\nnitration. Use of activated ion (AI) ECD, as described in our recent\nTable 1.

CID and IRMPD of nonre-\nduced nitrated lysozyme produced only a few fragments, as they\ncould not cleave the disulfide bonds (data not shown). Lower\ncharge states, z < 10, of nonreduced lysozyme produced even\nfewer MS\/MS fragments than the 10+ state.\nAs expected, reduction\/alkylation of the disulfide bonds\nprovided a remarkable improvement in the sequence coverage\nby MS\/MS. For bis-nitrated lysozyme, the total number of\nfragment ions was 56, 47, and 21 from ECD, IRMPD, and CID,\nFigure 1. ECD (a, b), IRMPD (c), and CID (d) MS\/MS of mononitrated myoglobin. Nitrated tyrosine residues are circled in the fragment\nsummaries.\n7287Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 82, No. 17, September 1, 2010\nrespectively, Figure 2. For mononitrated lysozyme, the total\nnumber of fragments was 59, 49, and 25 from ECD, IRMPD, and\nCID, respectively, Figures S-3-S-5 in the Supporting Information.\nIn the summary of MS\/MS fragments from mononitrated lysozyme\n(Figures S-3-S-5 in the Supporting Information), the nitration site\nis assumed to be at Tyr23. However neither ECD, nor IRMPD,\nnor CID data exclude the possibility that mono-nitration occurs\nat Tyr20. The number of MS\/MS fragments containing the site\nFigure 2. ECD (a, b), IRMPD (c), and CID (d) MS\/MS of bis-nitrated lysozyme. Nitrated tyrosine residues are circled.\n7288 Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 82, No. 17, September 1, 2010\nof nitration in mononitrated lysozyme is 26, 14, and 9 for ECD,\nIRMPD, and CID, respectively. The number of fragments contain-\ning the sites of nitration in bis-nitrated lysozyme is 23, 13, and 8\nfor ECD, IRMPD, and CID, respectively. Thus, ECD produced\nthe largest number of nTyr-containing fragments in both cases.\nECD cleaved the protein backbone two and three positions\nC-terminal of Tyr23 in mono- and bis-nitrated lysozyme, respec-\ntively. However no ECD cleavages closer than eight positions\nN-terminal of Tyr23 were produced. In contrast to that, IRMPD\ncleaves much closer to the nitration site(s) and, furthermore,\ncleaves between Tyr20 and Tyr23 in bis-nitrated lysozyme, Figure\n2c. CID of the nitrated lysozyme is the least efficient of the three\nMS\/MS techniques, as discussed below.\nNitrated Cytochrome c. Unmodified cytochrome c ions with\na charge state z g 9+ produce fragments extensively under ECD\nin our instrument with the exception of the region around the\ncovalent heme group attachment to the protein backbone.40\nPreviously we also pointed out the importance of searching for\nc\u2022 and z\u2032 ion fragments in ECD spectra of cytochrome c, as\nfor some charge states of cytochrome c their number exceeds\nthat of c\u2032 and z\u2022 fragments.40\nNitration of cytochrome c was not as efficient as in the cases\nof myoglobin and lysozyme. Electrospray mass spectra of the\nnitrated cytochrome c samples were dominated by the unmodified\nprotein ions with small peaks corresponding to mono- and bis-\nnitrated protein (\u223c20 and 15% of the abundance of the native\nprotein ions, respectively). LC separation of the sample containing\nnitrated cytochrome c using a strong cation exchange column was\nnot successful. Thus a small isolation window of 10 Th was used\nin order to isolate the ions of mononitrated protein from the ions\nof both unmodified and bis-nitrated protein for MS\/MS investiga-\ntion. Such a narrow isolation led to a reduction in the number of\ntrapped ions and adversely affected the MS\/MS analysis, i.e., the\nmajority of ECD fragments from the mononitrated protein were\nnot observed with intensities detectable above the noise level. ECD\nof bis-nitrated cytochrome c was more efficient, as a larger\nisolation m\/z width could be used. Additionally, in all the MS\/\nMS experiments on cytochrome c the most abundant charge state,\n14+, was used in order to maximize the number of fragments.\nMS\/MS spectra and summaries of fragments from nitrated\ncytochrome c are given in Figure 3. Although several ECD\nfragments, including c\u2022 and z\u2032-type ions, containing the possible\nsites of nitration were found for bis-nitrated cytochrome c, the\ntotal sequence coverage was still poor in comparison with\nmyoglobin and reduced lysozyme ECD data. CID of mono- and\nbis-nitrated cytochrome c was not efficient and produced only\na few fragments at N-terminus (data not shown). IRMPD of\nmononitrated cytochrome c was more efficient than ECD and\nproduced several backbone cleavages around the possible sites\nof nitration, Figure 3b. Both the ECD and IRMPD data allowed\nlocalization of the site(s) of nitration in the protein, and a\ncomparison could be made with other methods of nitration.\nCytochrome c has four tyrosine residues: Tyr48, Tyr67, Tyr74,\nand Tyr97. Tyr74 and Tyr97 are solvent-exposed, and the mono-\nnitration was expected to take place at either of them, as previously\nobserved with peroxynitrite as a nitrating agent.45,46 Tyr48 and\nTyr67 are less exposed, but Tyr67 is located close to Tyr 74 and\ncan be a target for secondary nitration. Batthyany et al.48 observed\nnitration in bis-nitrated cytochrome c at Tyr74 and Tyr67 or Tyr97\nand Tyr67. Interestingly, the authors did not report simultaneous\nnitration at Tyr74 and Tyr97.\nIn our MS\/MS experiments, IRMPD produced six and four\nC-terminal fragments between Tyr74 and Tyr97 in mono- and bis-\nnitrated protein, respectively, which did not contain the nitro\ngroup. Four fragments, again without the nitro group, were\nproduced from the same region by ECD of bis-nitrated cytochrome\nc. Only one C-terminal IRMPD fragment containing nTyr97 was\nobserved from mononitrated protein ((y294+)* in Figure 3b).\nFurthermore, no fragments containing nTyr48 were observed for\nECD or IRMPD, and three unmodified N-terminal ECD fragments\nbetween Tyr48 and Tyr67 indicated the absence of nitration at\nTyr48. Thus, while there is some evidence for initial nitration of\nTyr97, the majority of the data suggests that initial nitration occurs\nat Tyr74. As Tyr48 and Tyr97 appear to be less probable sites of\nnitration, the site of the secondary nitration is suggested to be\nTyr67.\nRecently we reported abundant losses of neutral species,\nincluding hydroxyl radicals, water, and ammonia, from nitrated\npeptides following ECD.38 We have also recorded abundant losses\nof neutral species from ECD of the intact nitrated proteins.\nHowever, significant loss of neutrals even from the unmodified\nproteins was present under ECD, as in the case of lysozyme,\nFigure 4a. A significant increase in the relative abundances of the\nfragment ions resulting from neutral losses was observed upon\nnitration, Figure 4b, but the neutral losses due to the nitration\ncould not be easily separated from the original neutral losses from\nthe unmodified protein.\nDISCUSSION\nECD was not completely inhibited in the vicinity of the site(s)\nof nitration: it produced cleavages at a distance of two and three\nresidues from nTyr23 in mono- and bis-nitrated lysozyme, respec-\ntively, Figure 2. However, the total number of cleavages in the\nvicinity of the nitration site(s) is larger in the case of IRMPD for\nall three proteins investigated. Table 2 summarizes the numbers\nof cleavages produced by ECD or IRMPD within six residues N-\nor C-terminal to the site(s) of nitration. IRMPD not only produced\nmore cleavages in that important region but also cleaved between\nthe two nitro-tyrosines in bis-nitrated lysozyme and cytochrome\nc, while ECD did not, Figures 2 and 3. That result is consistent\nwith the previous reports on suppression of ECD by nitration in\ndoubly charged peptides and higher efficiency of the \u201cslow-\nheating\u201d MS\/MS methods in such cases.38,39 However, in contrast\nto MS\/MS of peptides, ECD provided the largest total number of\nfragments from intact mononitrated myoglobin, mono- and bis-\nnitrated reduced lysozyme, and bis-nitrated cytochrome c (includ-\ning c\u2022 and z\u2032 fragments).\nSequence coverage by ECD was greater for nitrated myoglobin\nand reduced nitrated lysozyme than for nonreduced nitrated\nlysozyme and nitrated cytochrome c, where other internal\nmodifications were present: disulfide bonds (lysozyme) and a\nheme group (cytochrome c). In the case of ECD of nonreduced\nnitrated lysozyme, the poor sequence coverage was due to the\n(48) Batthyany, C.; Souza, J. M.; Duran, R.; Cassina, A.; Cervenansky, C.; Radi,\nR. Biochemistry 2005, 44, 8038\u20138046.\n7289Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 82, No. 17, September 1, 2010\nlimited cleavage of the disulfide bonds by ECD. Cleavage of all\nfour S-S bonds in lysozyme would require the capture of at least\nfour electrons. We did record up to four consecutive electron\ncapture events taking place for the 10+ charge state of nitrated\nlysozyme, which was indicated by the presence of (M + 10H)6+\ncharge-reduced ions in the ECD mass spectra. There is a\npossibility that both the disulfide bond and backbone cleavages\noccurred, but the resulting ECD fragments were held together\nby noncovalent interactions in the protein. However post-ECD\nIR activation, which we had previously used to release ECD\nfragments from the charge-reduced ions,40 did not produce new\nfragments. Therefore we conclude that multiple disulfide bond\nFigure 3. ECD (a) and IRMPD (b, c) of mono- (b) and bis-nitrated (a, c) cytochrome c. N-acetylated glycine, nitrated tyrosines, and cysteines\nbound to the heme group are circled.\n7290 Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 82, No. 17, September 1, 2010\ncleavages were either not efficient or were not proceeded by\nefficient backbone cleavages.\nECD in cytochrome c was hindered by the presence of two\nnitro groups and one heme group. While nitro groups act as\nelectron predators,38,39 the heme group is known to interfere with\nthe normal course of events during ECD.41 We also note that the\namount of sample of nitrated cytochrome c was much smaller\nthan that of nitrated myoglobin or lysozyme, because the reaction\nof nitration of cytochrome c was less efficient than for the other\ntwo proteins. Consequently, all three MS\/MS methods were less\nefficient for cytochrome c than for myoglobin and reduced\nlysozyme.\nCID produced more fragments than IRMPD from unmodified\nmyoglobin (35 vs 26, Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information).\nFor all the nitrated proteins studied, CID produced fewer frag-\nments than IRMPD. The reasons for such behavior are not\ncompletely clear. Both MS\/MS technique are \u201cslow-heating\u201d\nthreshold fragmentation methods. IRMPD is often regarded as a\nmore efficient fragmentation technique, as it acts upon not only\nthe isolated precursor ions but also upon their primary fragments,\nthus producing additional smaller fragment ions. Contrary to that,\nthe CID waveform is tuned to affect mostly the isolated precursor\nions. Additionally, in our instrument CID is carried out in the linear\nion trap and the fragments transported to and analyzed in the\nICR cell, while IRMPD is carried out directly in the ICR cell.\nTransmission of CID fragments to the ICR cell could induce\nadditional ion losses. Furthermore, in order to provide sufficient\nabundance of the fragment ions from top-down MS\/MS analysis\nof intact proteins, one has to isolate and fragment a much larger\nnumber of precursor ions than in the case of bottom-up MS\/MS\nanalysis of peptides. This is due to a much larger number of\ndissociation channels in MS\/MS of intact proteins. The number\nof precursor ions we typically isolate in the linear ion trap\ncorresponds to an AGC value of 106-107 for intact proteins, while\nfor peptide ions AGC values are 1-2 orders of magnitude\nsmaller. The larger number of intact protein ions in the LTQ\nshould cause stronger space-charge effects during CID. All CID\nmeasurements presented in this work were taken at the CID\nthreshold energy. We observed that above the threshold to\nCID the precursor protein ions were quickly depleted but that\ndid not lead to the production of new fragments. This may be\nan indication that many of the precursor ions were expelled\nfrom the LTQ during CID, rather than fragmented, or lost\nduring transportation from the LTQ to the ICR cell for mass\nanalysis. The effect was greater for CID of nitrated myoglobin\nand cytochrome c, where a two or three-step narrow isolation\nwas used in order to isolate the nitrated protein ions from the\nremaining unmodified proteins. A plausible explanation for this\nCID behavior is that the space charge effects in the LTQ were\naggravated by the narrow isolation and led to destabilization\nof the fragment ion trajectories during collisional excitation.\nBoth ECD and IRMPD should suffer less from this effect, as\nthey produce fragments inside the ICR cell and losses of the\nfragments there should be minimal.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur previous studies demonstrated that the high electron\naffinity of the nitro group inhibits normal ECD process in\nnitrotyrosine-containing peptides.38 Results from top-down MS\/\nMS on tyrosine nitration in myoglobin, lysozyme, and cytochrome\nc presented in this work indicate that ECD can be used to study\nintact nitrated proteins. ECD provided the largest total number\nFigure 4. Loss of neutrals from lysozyme ions under ECD. (a) Unmodified and (b) singly nitrated lysozyme.
