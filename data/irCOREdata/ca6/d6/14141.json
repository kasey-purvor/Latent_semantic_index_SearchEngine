Factor analysis and struc-\ntural equation modelling of different communication modes (face to face, email and telephone)\nrevealed that students experience at least some transactional distance when separated from their\ntutors. Email was found to facilitate the highest levels of immediacy of dialogue for most students.\nThe conclusion is that strategic students are best placed to benefit from blended learning, and that\nthe effects of transactional distance could be analysed more deeply if two subvariables of dialogue\nwere recognised. These are social presence (the perception of connectedness between students and\ntheir tutors) and immediacy (the temporal effects of dialogue).\nIntroduction\nLearning technologies can provide \u2018any time, any place\u2019 learning opportunities\n(Wheeler & Vranch, 2001). Reflecting this trend, the term \u2018blended learning\u2019\ndescribes incorporation of distance and local learning activities. Improved communi-\ncation bandwidth and greater access to computers have blurred the boundaries of\ncontemporary practice. Consequently, the term \u2018distance education\u2019 may now be\nredundant, as geographical distance should no longer be a barrier between teacher\nand learner (Dabbagh, 2004). Instead, gaining a better understanding of psycholog-\nical distance may hold the key to the successful teaching of distributed students.\nPerceptual distances have profound effects on learners who are separated for long\nperiods from their tutors. One-half of all distance learners fail to complete their\n*Faculty of Education, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Plymouth PL4 8AA, UK. Email:\nS.Wheeler@plymouth.ac.uk\n104 S. Wheeler\nstudies (Ross et al., 1991; Moore & Kearsley, 1996; Simpson, 2004). Lack of\ndialogue may heighten perceptions of distance, which may contribute toward such\npoor retention rates (Dron et al., 2004). Perceptual distance should therefore assume\nimportance as a research focus. The means through which perceptual distance can be\nempirically measured and analysed constitutes the methodological basis of this study.\nMoore\u2019s (1973) theory of transactional distance was applied as an explanatory frame-\nwork, with perceptual distance predicted by the variables of dialogue, structure and\nstudent autonomy. The study utilised Entwistle\u2019s (1981) Approaches to Study Inven-\ntory and two additionally devised Likert-scale inventories to measure the variables\npredicted to influence transactional distance. Structural equation modelling was\napplied to enable visualisation of the relationships between these variables, and to\nassess the statistical power and validity of the research findings.\nTransactional distance theory\nAccording to transactional distance theory (Moore, 1993), perceptual distance is\npresent in every educational transaction. The transactional distance between student\nand tutor, whether based upon perceptions of intellectual differentials, demographic\nvariables such as age or gender, or cultural distances such as language, may create the\npotential for misunderstandings to occur.\nTransactional distance theory predicts that psychological distance between\nstudents and tutors varies as a result of the structure and dialogue mix within trans-\nactions. If structure is high, dialogue decreases; whereas if dialogue is high, structure\ndecreases. Moore\u2019s theory predicts that greater presence of dialogue in the learning\ntransaction should reduce transactional distance, engender better understanding and\nlessen the potential for misunderstandings to occur. This study focuses on how\ncommunication technologies may mediate psychological distance. Blended learning\ncommunication is represented across three modalities\u2014the baseline measurement of\nface-to-face communication, and two distance-based technologies: telephone and\nemail.\nResearch hypotheses\nThe study set out to explore two hypotheses.\nThe first was that students whose dialogue with their tutors is mediated by technol-\nogy should report greater (i.e. more remote) transactional distance than students\nwhose dialogue with their tutors is conducted through face-to-face communication,\ndue to the reduction of social cues and a decrease or inhibition in the richness of\ncommunication that would normally be expected to be present in face-to-face\ndialogue. Such reductions should amplify the potential for misunderstandings to\noccur and for a raised perception of distance due to a lessening of social presence.\nThe second hypothesis was that distance learners should report greater transac-\ntional distance of communication with their teacher if dialogue is mediated through\nasynchronous text-based technologies. This may result in less satisfaction with the\nTransactional distance in blended learning 105\nlearning experience due to a greater potential for misunderstandings to occur. Where\nsynchronous technologies are employed, distance learners should report less (i.e.\ncloser) transactional distance, leading to the potential for less misunderstanding to\noccur during dialogue. This could be due to the tendency of synchronous forms of\ncommunication to sacrifice structure in favour of greater dialogue. Synchronous\ntechnologies were also thought to provide more immediacy of dialogue, providing\nremote students with rapid support and guidance.\nSample\nIn an opportunistic sample, 348 students enrolled on a variety of continuing profes-\nsional development courses for teachers participated in the study. The participants\nstudied across a broad spectrum of study modes mixing face-to-face on-campus\nlearning with varying amounts of directed study undertaken both at home and in the\nworkplace.\nParticipants were predominantly female, with 307 females and 38 males in the\nsample (three participants declined to report their gender) (Table 1). This gender\nbias is consistent with similar recent studies where females constitute the largest\npercentage of students studying on humanities-based and liberal arts-based courses,\nsuch as teaching in the United Kingdom (Goodyear et al., 2003). As is common in\ncontinuing professional development, the sample was predominantly mature,\ncomprised mainly of fully employed, part-time students.\nMethod\nParticipants completed a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire, containing Entwistle\u2019s\n(1981) Approaches to Study Inventory, the Student Support Inventory (Wheeler,\n2002) and the Communication Mode Questionnaire (see http:\/\/\nwww2.plymouth.ac.uk\/distancelearning\/). The Student Support Inventory measured\nstudents\u2019 perceptions of expected and received support and the Communication\nMode Questionnaire measured perceptions of dialogue, structure and transactional\ndistance in different communication modes. Data were collected over a two-and-a-\nhalf-year period, as each student cohort commenced study. The questionnaire also\ncontained demographic questions, and asked about expected tutor support.\nTable 1.

Wheeler\nStructural equation modelling\nThe first stage of the structural equation modelling process required the creation of a\nmodel that would represent the theoretical interrelationships between the proposed\nvariables of structure, dialogue and study approaches in all three modes of\ncommunication. Through factor analysis, a first-order path model was constructed\ncomprising of three latent variables.\nExogenous model\nFigure 1 represents the proposed full \u2018three-factor\u2019 exogenous model. The ovals\nrepresent the three latent variables, while the rectangles represent the questionnaire\nitems as observed, dependent variables that contribute to the latent variables. This\nwas a theoretical model used as a template for the actual data, enabling visualisation\nof the potential relationships between observed and latent variables (factors).\nFigure 1. Theoretical full three-factor model used for confirmatory factor analysisFollowing confirmatory analysis using EQS software, one item was removed from\nthe model (ASI11B\u2014relating new learning to \u2018real life\u2019) as its inclusion reduced\ngoodness of fit. The revised full three-factor model for approaches to study is illus-\ntrated in Figure 2 complete with estimated factor loadings.\nFigure 2. Revised full three-factor face-to-face model with standardised solutionSingle-headed arrows show standardised factor loadings, and double-headed\narrows represent the inter-factor correlations. The double-headed arrow joining two\nof the variables on the extreme left of the model indicates a correlation between two\nerror terms. Factor loadings are equivalent to standardised regression beta coeffi-\ncients, which were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (Miyake et al.,\n2000).\nASI1B\nASI18B \nASI13B \nASI4B \nASI22B \nASI12B \nASI6B \nASI29B \nASI11B Strategic \nAutonomy\nSurface \nFigure 1. Theoretical full three-factor model used for confirmatory factor analysis\nTransactional distance in blended learning 107\nFactor loadings, correlations and beta coefficients significant at the 0.05 level and\nbelow are indicated by asterisks. The fit indices for this revised model were within\nacceptable limits, producing a statistically non-significant \u03c72(16) = 21.962, p <\n0.186, indicating that the model\u2019s predictions did not significantly deviate from the\nexpected data pattern. The comparative fit index (CFI = 0.97) and the normed fit\nindex (NFI = 0.95) were clearly above the generally accepted cut-off point of 0.90\n(Byrne, 1994).\nStrategic approaches to study do not preclude the use of surface approaches if\nrequired; for example, during intense revision for an impending written examination.\nThis may explain the significant correlation between the surface and strategic factors\n(r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Strategic learners can manage their own personal study routines\nbetter, and require less tutor input, developing skills to manage course content and\nmonitor their own progress. They have better self knowledge and know how to eval-\nuate the outcomes of their own learning to inform themselves of future directions for\nstudy (Weinstein & Van Mater Stone, 1996). The strategic label was thus applied to\nthe factor explaining the revised items grouping.\nEndogenous model\nThe factor structure for the first theoretical model represents the face-to-face modal-\nity of communication between student and tutor, and also by extension the other\ncommunication modalities to be tested.\n0.20*\n0.75*\n \n0.69*\n \n0.47*\n0.67*\n \n0.20*\n \n0.40*\n0.27*\n \n0.95*\nStatistics:\nCFI = 0.97,\nNFI = 0.95,  \n2 (16) = 21.962,\np = 0.186 \nRMSEA = 0.038\nSurface\nStrategic\nAutonomy\nOrganising\nstudy time\nChanging \nstudy conditions\nPrompt at\nstarting study\nPrecise study\ninstructions\nMore interested\nin qualification\nReading just\nenough\nImportant to\ndo well \n \nNeed a lot of\nconcentration\n-0.20\n0.43*\n-0.15\nFigure 2.

Wheeler\nThe second factor is an aspect of dialogue, based upon the work of Shin (2003),\nand represents transactional presence. The third and final factor represents items\nrelated to immediacy, a proposed affordance of the technology mediated process of\ndialogue between teacher and student.\nThe one-way arrows between factors represent the strength and direction of the\nassumed causal relationships between latent and dependent variables, and are\nmeasured as regression or beta coefficients. The two-headed arrows are correlations,\nindicating the strength of association between the latent variables.\nThe next stage in the structural equation modelling process was to fit the complete\nmodel together by combining the exogenous model together with an endogenous\nmodel into a full face-to-face modality pathway matrix and then running a third,\ngeneral, model fit analysis as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Structural equation model (modality model: face to face). \u03c72(120) = 171.08, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.05.The EQS software analysis showed that the chi-squared value was statistically non-\nsignificant, at \u03c72(28) = 39.301, p = 0.145, indicating that the model\u2019s predictions did\nnot transgress data pattern boundaries. Both the CFI (0.98) and NFI (0.98) were\nabove the recommended 0.95 limit and were thus deemed acceptable. The Root\nMean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) value achieved a good fit at 0.50 so\nthe model was accepted as the baseline face-to-face model and used for all subsequent\ncomparisons between communication modes.

Of these\nendogenous factors, the first represents Moore\u2019s concept of \u2018structure\u2019 and is\nmeasured through student evaluations of how important they perceived tutor contact,\nand whether this contact improved the quality of course delivery. Also contributing\nto the factor of structure is the extent to which student felt dialogue with the tutor\nimposed structure upon their learning. The second factor of social \u2018presence\u2019\nrepresenting students\u2019 perceptions of connectedness to their tutors is derived from\ntheir responses to questions relating to how they could best communicate their study\nneeds, their perceptions of distance reduction, amelioration of misunderstandings\nand perceptions of isolation. The third factor represents perceptions of immediacy in\ndialogue. Immediacy represents temporal perceptions such as the accessibility of\ntutors and the affordance of the technology to enable reflection on learning or gaining\nquick responses.\nFollowing the successful fit of the baseline face-to-face modality model, two\nadditional pathway models were constructed to represent students\u2019 perceptions of\ncommunication with their tutors using email and telephone.

Wheeler\nwith identical pathways, and tested individually for goodness of fit. Lagrange Multi-\nplier (LM) tests were similarly performed on each model to ascertain the best fits for\neach.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, several parameters were taken into account including preferred\napproaches to study reported by students measured against the amount of structure,\nsocial presence and immediacy perceived by learners to have been present within each\nof the three tutor support modes. The three factors were constructed from items in\nthe Communication Mode Questionnaire. Although the model was identified in face-\nto-face mode with a CFI of 0.92 and in telephone mode with a CFI of 0.94, the CFI\nfor email mode was well below acceptable limits. However, after this model had been\nadjusted by convergence of two of the factors (surface and strategic approaches to\nstudy) into one (strategic), a more acceptable model CFI fit was obtained at 0.93.\nThe need to converge factors in email mode exposed an interesting effect relating\nto the nature of strategic study approaches. Convergence of the two factors was justified\nthrough a consideration of strategic learning approaches that embrace both deep and\nsurface approaches. Students adopt strategic approaches depending upon the\ndemands of the learning activity, switching between them according to need and expe-\ndiency (Entwistle, 1981). It is plausible to surmise from the need to converge factors\nthat students using email as a means to communicate with their remote tutors may\nrely more on strategic approaches to study than they do when they use more familiar\ntelephone and face-to-face communication methods to access tutor support. They may\nneed to adopt more flexible approaches to communication with their tutors due to the\nunfamiliar and less predictable nature of the technologies. The average age of students\nin the sample was 40.8 years, ensuring that the majority of participants in the study\nwould not have used computer-based applications such as email at school, and would\nbe less habituated in using them than the more familiar telephone. There may also be\nother variables influencing this result, such as the comparatively more limited access\nparticipants have to these new technologies, and the possibility of lack of technical skill\nand confidence in their effective use. The factor convergence adjustment will therefore\nbe taken into account in this analysis of the three tutor support modalities.\nIt was important that, once a model fit had been established for the baseline\nface-to-face measurement model, the subsequent comparison models exhibited\nidentical features including pathways, factors, and the same array of modality\nspecific variables.\nModel parameters\nIn this causal model, autonomous learners tend to perceive more rigidity or structure\nin their courses (\u03b2 = \u22120.37, not significant) than their surface learner counterparts (\u03b2\n= \u22122.71, not significant). Furthermore, as autonomous behaviour increases, so\nstructural perceptions of the course will decrease. This result is expected, given that\nTransactional distance in blended learning 111\nautonomous learners impose their own structure and therefore demand less structure\nfrom their tutors than surface learners. The strongest contributing measure to the\nsurface factor is the need for precise study instructions (\u03b2 = 0.52, p < 0.05).\nConversely the strongest item loading onto the autonomy factor is an item relating to\nstudents\u2019 need to control the learning process through self-organisation of time (\u03b2 =\n0.76, p < 0.05). This is the basis upon which this model and its companion models\nare founded. The central parameters are thus used as predictors of student responses\nin any given factor context.\nFor specific discussion of the models we explore immediacy in dialogue and how it\nmay contribute toward a clearer understanding of the possible causes and effects of\ntransactional distance.\nImmediacy\nAs previously discussed, immediacy in this study refers to the extent to which\nstudents feel they can gain quick access to their tutors, and their perception of the\ntimeliness of tutor responses. Immediacy is established in face-to-face settings\nthrough nodding, smiling and other non-verbal behaviours such as eye contact and\ngaze. It can also be characterised in paraverbal utterances such as backchannelling\nand other confirmatory utterances. Such behaviours are often subconsciously\nmanaged (Argyle & Dean, 1965), but if they are absent or poorly mediated through\nthe communication medium, students will notice. Immediacy also seems to at least\npartially to encompass the notion of the student\u2019s perception of \u2018connectedness\u2019 to\nthe tutor as mediated through the appropriate technology, although this effect is\nperhaps better represented as a feature of social presence. Immediacy has been\nidentified as an important measure of psychological distance, and could therefore be\nassociated with perceived social presence in distance settings, as proposed by Argyle\nand Dean (1965). It is likely that a perception of lack of immediacy, resulting in a\nfeeling of reduced social presence, may amplify the detrimental effects of transac-\ntional distance.\nde Kerckhove (1997) suggests immediacy is an artefact of the increased capabilities\nof communication technologies to facilitate interaction. The ability, for example, of\ntutors to respond quickly or even \u2018instantly\u2019 to students\u2019 requests for help is extremely\nvariable. If perceptions of immediacy can be increased or enhanced using technology-\nmediated communication, however, we could surmise that face-to-face environments\nmight take second place to that technology in the preferences of some students. If this\nwere possible to achieve, it would represent the utopian ideal of distance learning\nactually surpassing the equivalency afforded by face-to-face learning (Simonson et al.,\n2000). Less variable would be the tutor\u2019s ability to respond quickly to provide\nfeedback on a student\u2019s work, but sending a quick acknowledgement of receipt would\nstill be possible and indeed even desirable (Collis & Moonen, 2002) as a means of\nestablishing some form of immediacy in the mind of the student. Either way, distance\nlearners generally agree that immediacy of responses from their tutors encourages\nthem to keep on track with their studies, and provides much needed impetus and\n112 S. Wheeler\nmotivation to persist with study. Indeed, timely responses and feedback from tutors\nmay constitute the most significant predictor of distance learner satisfaction\n(Tallman, 1994).\nImmediacy may also directly influence feelings of intimacy in relationship building\nbetween student and tutor. Gunawardena (1995) has argued that immediacy can\nconvey closeness and \u2018warmth\u2019, while lack of immediacy often connotes aloofness or\n\u2018coldness\u2019 (Wallace, 1999), indicating that there is a clear relationship between imme-\ndiacy and intimacy. Gunawardena and Zittle (1997) also connect intimacy and social\npresence, arguing they are measures of the amount of \u2018psychological distance that a\ncommunicator puts between him or herself and the object of his\/her communication\u2019\n(p. 9). Gunawardena and Zittle consider that tutors can convey this intimacy as an\nimmediacy of communication through both verbal and non-verbal means, the latter\nusually through dress codes, facial expressions, and so on. Patently, such non-verbal\nexpressions of immediacy are best conveyed through communication in face-to-face\nmode. Immediacy can be a feature of either the communications technology itself or\nthe skills and attributes of the communicator (Short et al., 1976; Whittaker, 1996). It\nis of course entirely possible that immediacy may be an artefact of both the individ-\nual\u2019s skills and the affordance of the technology. Notwithstanding this discussion,\nimmediacy should be considered an important predictor of student satisfaction, and\ncould also therefore be deemed a key predictor of transactional distance.\nIt is apparent from the results of the structural equation modelling of the modality\nhypothesis that out of the communication modes email is associated with the greatest\nperception of immediacy of response from the tutor for autonomous students at \u03b2 =\n0.49, p = 0.00001 (Table 2). This result runs counter to hypothesis two, and is a\nsomewhat surprising finding, being the only asynchronous communication modality\nchosen for analysis within this study. However, if de Kerckhove and others are\ncorrect, and technology-mediated communication has the capability to enhance\ncommunication characteristics such as immediacy, this finding makes sense.\nThere is a caveat to this finding, however. This result could be confounded by the\ninclusion of the \u2018time to reflect\u2019 questionnaire item within this factor. Time to reflect\nis important for many students, particularly those who approach study in a less\nimpulsive manner. Students who need time to reflect may prefer the asynchronous\naffordance of communication through email when compared with synchronous\nmodes of communication such as the telephone. The presence of the \u2018time to reflect\u2019\nitem within the immediacy factor may be a misleading element. Future questionnaire\ndesign would need to take into account the possibility that there may be two separate\naspects of immediacy that influence a student\u2019s perception of how quickly the tutor\nresponds. It is probable that immediacy of tutor response and the ability to defer\nimmediate response in favour of greater time for reflection are two separate\nconstructs.\nThese results may also be due to an increased usage of email to communicate in\nrecent times, with the telephone being relegated to second place in the working life of\nmany. Longer, more detailed, email messages can be composed and sent, and there\nis the facility for tutors to program automatic acknowledgements of message receipt\nTransactional distance in blended learning 113\ninto their systems. Email use can also be creative, providing users with a rich reper-\ntoire of text-based expressions, emoticons and other devices with which to commu-\nnicate (Wheeler & Nistor, 2003). Such variables should be acknowledged in any\nanalysis of this type.\nBoth the student autonomy (\u03b2 = 0.49, z = 9.457, p = 0.00001) and strategic\napproaches to study factors (\u03b2 = 0.77, z = 4.542, p = 0.00001) for email mode show\nstatistically significant beta coefficients. These results indicate that students who can\ndirect their own study will perceive more immediacy from email communication than\ntheir less autonomous counterparts. Furthermore, those who are able to approach\ntheir learning in a strategic, flexible and versatile manner will perceive greater levels\nof immediacy in email-mediated communication. Similarly with students who need\nmore time to contemplate their learning, the findings suggest that students scoring\nhigh in personal autonomy tend to see email as offering a more effective facility with\nwhich to reflect upon the learning process. They may also view it as a better utility\nthrough which to receive valid and more considered tutor responses in comparison\nwith other modes of communication. The affordance of permanency of email through\narchiving may advance dialogue beyond real-time events for these students.\nStrategic learners within the sample may also consider that email provides greater\naccessibility to the remote tutor than other modes of communication. Co-present\ninteractions can be rushed or deferred due to pressure of time, environmental distrac-\ntion or other communication constraints. Email communication would not be\ndirectly affected by these constraints. Further research into these possibilities should\nbe considered as this is perhaps one area in which distance students might regularly\nbenefit over their traditional on-campus counterparts.\nStudents receiving timely tutor responses by email could be more predisposed to\nperceptions of immediacy than those who experienced longer waits. Another factor\nworthy of consideration is the perceived urgency or importance of the message sent\nby the student to the tutor. If students perceive that messages they have sent to their\ntutors are urgent, yet they receive no response, or they receive a response they\nconsider to be unduly delayed, more remote transactional distance may be experi-\nenced than if they perceived their messages to be less urgent. Transactional distance\ncould also be a function of the students\u2019 perceptions of the urgency or importance of\ntheir message, regardless of the media or technology used to mediate the communi-\ncation process. Asynchronous communication systems such as email should therefore\nfare less well than synchronous systems as a means of conveying urgent messages.\nSocial presence\nThis study investigated the link between transactional distance and social presence.\nSimilarly to transactional distance, social presence is a perceived aspect of technol-\nogy-mediated communication, and both are hypothesised to have their basis in\ndialogic processes, so the theoretical basis seems feasible.\nAs social presence is indicative of feelings of connectedness, less autonomous\nstudents who are more dependent on their tutors should seek higher levels. However,\n114 S. Wheeler\nin this sample, a significant finding is observed for autonomous learners. An\nexamination of the results shown in the summary of coefficients in Table 2 reveals\nthat the email communication yields the steepest beta coefficient for autonomous\nlearner perceptions of social presence (\u03b2 = 0.31, p < 0.05). This result runs counter\nto hypothesis two, supporting earlier findings of increased perception of immediacy\nwithin email mode.\nAutonomous students in the sample may have perceived face-to-face conversation\nwith their tutor to be dialogically the poorest, thereby engendering a more remote\ntransactional distance. Due to their high levels of autonomous behaviour, such\nstudents may be more comfortable studying remotely from their tutors, preferring to\ncommunicate in a manner that enables them to maintain a level of control. Email\ncertainly provides such learner centric affordances. Conversely, surface studiers\nreported much lower levels of social presence in telephone mode (\u03b2 = \u22121.45, not\nsignificant) and much higher levels of social presence face to face (\u03b2 = 2.98, not\nsignificant). This result is more in line with expectations, given that surface learners\ntend to rely more on direct instruction and tutor feedback than their more autono-\nmous peers. Communication over telephone would therefore be less preferable for\nsurface learners than a face-to-face tutorial. However, these results should be treated\nwith some caution, as the beta coefficients are statistically non-significant.\nThis result appears to support the earlier finding that immediacy was perceived by\nparticipants to be higher in email mode. Although the two are associated, perhaps a\ndistinction between immediacy and perceived social presence should be clarified.\nImmediacy has already been defined as relating to the learner perception of connect-\nedness and accessibility to the tutor. It also has elements of reflection on learning and\nis therefore essentially temporal. Conversely, social presence focuses more on the\naffordances of the communicating medium, and perceptions that the student is\ncommunicating with a real person rather than with a mute technology. Social pres-\nence defines the qualitative difference between students being able to communicate\ntheir needs from a distance, thereby reducing social isolation, as opposed to the ease\nof accessing tutor support and the gaining of quick response times. Characterising\ntwo distinct aspects of dialogue in the form of immediacy and social presence may be\nhelpful to determine its function in transactional distance better.\nStructure\nStructure has been defined as the extent of the constraints imposed upon students\nthrough the way a course is delivered, managed and evaluated. In this context, study\ncan be characterised by its level of flexibility or rigidity. Lower levels of structure were\nreported by strategic learners in telephone mode than in other modes (\u03b2 = 0.92, z =\n2.671, p = 0.003), with the highest levels of structure being reported in face-to-face\ncontexts (\u03b2 = 2.61, z = 1.503, p = 0.06, not significant). Students therefore reported\nmore flexibility in telephone mode than in face-to-face contact with their tutors.\nWhile the face-to-face result should be treated with caution, the finding in telephone\nmode is statistically significant and suggests that this mode of communication may\nTransactional distance in blended learning 115\nimpose a lesser level of structure upon strategic distance learners than any of the other\nmodes. This is possibly due to an increase in the dialogue that is inherent in telephone\ncommunication. If Moore\u2019s transactional distance theory is correct, the telephone\nshould produce the least transactional distance for strategic distance learners due to\nits greater potential to reduce structure. Telephone-mediated dialogue may subvert\nstructure due to its often informal and open-ended nature. It should also be noted\nthat the telephone is probably the most easily accessible and familiar of the\ntechnologies for the majority of the participants.\nAnalysis of email communication also yielded a statistically significant positive\nregression (\u03b2 = 0.98, p < 0.05) from strategic approaches to structure, which suggests\nthat this technology would actually impose greater levels of structure for strategic\ndistance learners. If Moore\u2019s theory is correct, email would actually create a more\nremote transactional distance for strategic learners than other modes of communica-\ntion, with the telephone emerging as the technology that is least likely to impose\nstructure.\nIn the original modality hypothesis, co-present tutorials were predicted to evoke the\nleast amount of reported transactional distance, on the basis that the level of dialogue\nwould be richer. If dialogue is richer in face-to-face communication, then close trans-\nactional distance would be experienced; while if high levels of structure were\nimposed, remote transactional distance would result. It is clear from an examination\nof the covariance matrix that face-to-face mode is actually one of the most effective\nmodes in imposing structure upon strategic distance learners (\u03b2 = 2.15, z = 1.484, p\n= 0.06, not significant). Some autonomous learners in the sample may have been able\nto subvert the structural effects of the face-to-face encounter more effectively than in\nmost of the other communication modes (\u03b2 = \u20130.37, z = \u20130.602, p = 0.27, not\nsignificant). Autonomous learners may have achieved this by proactively instigating\nmore dialogue with their remote tutors, which would decrease structure. However,\nthis is conjectural as, again, these results were far from conclusive and yielded no\nstatistical significance.\nWhat also remains unresolved is whether the imposed structure on study actually\nincreases transactional distance. Many commentators suggest that this is the case, but\ndoubt remains (Vrasidas & McIsaac, 1999), and there is also a dearth of concerted\nresearch into this effect within multiple-mode learning environments. It may be\nbeneficial to approach this problem by viewing structure, perception of social\npresence and immediacy as three separate constructs, each of which may contribute\ntoward transactional distance. Moore\u2019s original configuration of structure and\ndialogue remains intact, but with dialogue consisting of at least two subfactors, social\npresence and immediacy. These are therefore proposed as revised predictors of trans-\nactional distance.\nConclusions\nThere are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the opportunistic sample comprised\nseveral cohorts of students studying in a variety of blended modes, at various levels\n116 S. Wheeler\nfrom foundation degree to postgraduate study. The statistical method was not\ndesigned to investigate the nuances and subtleties of individual student experiences\nacross such a range of levels. Secondly, the mix of communication modes provides\nlittle knowledge about student perceptions for those who engaged in both modes of\ndistance communication. It would be unwise to attempt to generalise these findings\nacross all blended learning experiences, but the results nonetheless raise some\ninteresting issues.\nStatistically significant findings related mainly to autonomous and strategic\nlearners. Email seems to provide the highest level of immediacy of dialogue for learn-\ners who are proactive and who control their own learning activities (p = 0.00001).\nEmail also provides the greatest amount of social presence for autonomous students\n(p < 0.05). However, email is also likely to impose the highest amount of structure on\nstrategic learners, and if this is at the expense of dialogue then it is likely to create a\nmore remote transactional distance for this type of learner (p < 0.05). Finally, the\ntelephone tends to impose the least amount of structure on strategic learners (p <\n0.05), which may lessen transactional distance.\nIt can be concluded from these findings that students experience at least some\nelements of transactional distance when separated from their tutors. Structure can be\nimposed by communication technologies to varying degrees, with the telephone\nappearing to produce the lowest level. Dialogue can be mediated through a variety of\ntechnologies but for this sample email appears to facilitate the highest levels of\nimmediacy, and so should be considered an important communication technology for\ntutors to develop within any blended learning strategy. The future success of blended\nlearning will rely heavily on technology-mediated communication, but even more on\nthe skills and knowledge of responsive tutors.\nReferences\nArgyle, M. & Dean, J.
