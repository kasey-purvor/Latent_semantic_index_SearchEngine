Introduction\nIn everyday living and working environments, people\nperform a large number of tasks on surfaces such as desks\nand tables. For mobile users, these surface-based tasks often\nheavily involve portable computing devices, ranging from\nlaptops to mobile phones. During such tasks, the ability to\nconfigure wired and wireless connections between the de-\nvices can be crucial. For meetings and collaborative work,\nit is commonplace for multiple users to have several devices\neach, and to utilise some form of shared virtual workspace\nbetween the devices.\nSuch application scenarios can be greatly enhanced us-\ning knowledge of the fine-grained location and\/or orienta-\ntion of the devices on the surface. Current location systems\nwhich can supply surface-based positioning data are thus\ninappropriate, since they rely on costly and labour-intensive\ninstallations of transducers and equipment in the environ-\nment.\nThis paper presents a novel prototype system which al-\nlows users\u2019 mobile devices to perform peer-to-peer sensing\non a surface and compute their locations and orientations\nin a 2D space. We first outline specific surface-based ap-\nplications for mobile users, and propose infrared light as a\nfine-grained location sensing medium appropriate for their\nportable devices. We then detail our implementation and\ncharacterisation of the prototype system. Our findings show\nthat such a system supports the positioning requirements of\nmobile users\u2019 surface-based tasks.\n2. Related Work and Motivation\nThis section first outlines applications which require the\nlocation and orientation of user devices placed upon sur-\nfaces, such as desks and meeting tables. It is then demon-\nstrated that current location technologies are inappropriate\nfor mobile users and their portable devices. The choice of\ninfrared as a fine-grained, 2D location sensing technology\nfor these devices is then justified.\n2.1. Surface-based activities of mobile users\nThe relative positions and orientations of devices on sur-\nfaces can be used to enable a variety of applications highly\nrelevant to mobile users. As proposed by Scott et al., actions\nsuch as PDA-to-laptop synchronisation and digital camera\nimage downloading can be automatically initiated when the\ntwo devices concerned are placed in close proximity, and\nthe source device is oriented to face the destination de-\nvice [1]. The authors also suggest that positioning informa-\ntion is used to configure a temporary interface export from\na small device to a larger one. For example, a PDA might be\nplaced next to a laptop to allow a person to use the laptop\u2019s\nkeyboard and touchpad to manipulate documents stored on\nthe PDA.\nOften, many devices are placed on a single working sur-\nface, including keyboards, monitors, laptops, PDAs, mobile\nphones, and digital cameras. Their relative positioning in-\nformation can be used to create GUI representations of the\nlayout of the devices on the table. These allow the user to\neasily specify source and destination of data by perform-\ning drag-and-drop actions between devices across the sur-\nface (hyperdragging) [2].\nConfiguring connectivity between devices is also ex-\ntremely important for mobile users who gather for team-\noriented tasks, as shown previously [3]. Positioning infor-\nmation of the users\u2019 portable devices, such as laptops, mo-\nbile phones, and PDAs, can be used to facilitate easy trans-\nfer of data objects between team members, as well as au-\ntomatic configuration of associations between devices. For\nexample, using a laptop with a GUI representation of the de-\nvices on the table, one person can associate some data with\na small, nearby device, making it a token for the data (sim-\nilar in concept to the mediaBlocks presented by Ullmer et\nal. [4]). The token can then be handed to another group\nmember, who can place it in close proximity to their own\ndevice to indicate that the system should transfer the data.\nAlternatively, the token might represent a shared meet-\ning resource, such as a projector. As the meeting progresses\nthe token can be passed between participants, each of whom\ncan display content on the projector by placing the token\nnear and pointing it toward their own device. A URL or\nfile specified by the user possessing the token could then\nbe transferred temporarily to the PC driving the projector,\nwhich then displays the data object. (In this way, the token\nwould provide some of the functionality of the Meeting-\nMachine Remote Control, described by Barton et al. [3].)\nThe projector token might also be placed in the centre of\nthe meeting participants\u2019 table, and then its orientation used\nto indicate the device which should control the content dis-\nplayed on the projector.\nIn modern devices, wireless communication such as\nBluetooth or WiFi is often available. Achieving the above\ndiscussed applications is then only a matter of software.\nMost of the application scenarios described involve con-\nfiguring connections and transfers between devices on\nthe surface. Thus, the necessary positioning informa-\ntion provided to the applications need only be relative\n(referenced to the devices themselves) rather than abso-\nlute (referenced to the surface or the room). The positioning\nrequirements of the applications discussed can be sum-\nmarised as follows:\n1. Location accuracy: between 10 cm and 20 cm, a granu-\nlarity similar in size to the smaller devices which might\nbe used (mobile phones and PDAs)\n2. Orientation accuracy: about 30\u00b0, allowing detection of\nwhen devices are facing one another\n3. Update rate: once every few seconds, providing ade-\nquate response time for configuring connections\n4. Number of devices: up to twenty for large meetings or\nmobile users with many devices on a single surface\n2.2. Existing location technologies\nappropriate for surfaces\nCertain indoor location systems for context-aware com-\nputing are able to provide fine-grained location and\norientation information sufficient for applications on sur-\nfaces [5, 6]. Systems have also been developed specif-\nically for surface-based location sensing. These have\nused a number of techniques, including computer vi-\nsion [2, 7, 8], physical contact or weight [9, 10], optical\nmouse tracking [11], and short-range electromagnetic sig-\nnals [12].\nThe indoor location systems mentioned above accom-\nplish wide-area fine-grained tracking, while the majority of\nthe surface-based systems have been designed for user in-\nterface scenarios which require centimetre resolution and\nmany updates per second. As a result, many of these sys-\ntems have a high cost due to their sensor density, spe-\ncialised transducers, or installation and calibration effort.\nMoreover, all of these systems require static, pre-installed\ninfrastructure. For mobile users who wish to easily con-\nnect their portable devices wherever they go, or hold spon-\ntaneous meetings enhanced by location-enabled, shared vir-\ntual workspaces, systems requiring augmentation of the en-\nvironment are impractical.\n2.3. Enabling surface-based location\nsensing on devices\nIn order to avoid reliance on pre-installed tracking in-\nfrastructure, users\u2019 devices must incorporate sensing tech-\nnology. The inclusion of the sensing technology should not\nadversely affect the battery life, size, or cost of the mobile\ndevices. Accordingly, the transducers chosen should have\na low power consumption, small form factor, and low sig-\nnal processing overhead.\nComputer vision and ultrasonic sensing technologies\nhave been shown to be successful for fine-grained location,\nand could be incorporated into user devices for surface-\nbased location. For example, low-resolution cameras have\nbeen incorporated into some mobile phones, PDAs, and lap-\ntops. However, providing 360\u00b0 coverage around a device\nwould involve using many cameras or ultrasonic transduc-\ners, potentially raising the cost, size, and complexity of the\ndevices to a prohibitive level.\nConversely, a wide selection of infrared sensing tech-\nnologies are available which are less expensive, smaller,\nand have lower signal processing requirements than com-\nputer vision or ultrasound\u2013based techniques. Previously, in-\nfrared has been used for location systems with coarse gran-\nularity, ranging from room-scale to metre-scale accuracy.\nExamples include the Active Badge [13], ParcTab [14], Lo-\ncust Swarm [15], and a system for wearable computing [16].\nThese systems rely upon infrared signal visibility between\na fixed unit in the environment and a mobile unit, such as a\ndevice or tag. If a signal is visible, then it is assumed that\nthe mobile unit is in the same area as the fixed unit, allow-\ning a location to be inferred.\nThe HiBall system, designed for augmented and vir-\ntual reality, uses infrared to accomplish fine-grained track-\ning [17]. User-worn devices consisting of lateral effect pho-\ntodiode clusters are used to accurately detect the angle of\narrival of signals from arrays of ceiling-mounted infrared\nLEDs with known positions, and the location and orienta-\ntion of the user is tracked using Kalman filtering. The sys-\ntem has the capability for sub-centimetre and sub-degree\ntracking resolution, but the user-worn devices are large and\ncontain specialised hardware, making them inappropriate\nfor widespread incorporation into portable devices such as\nmobile phones or PDAs.\nIn contrast to previous infrared systems, we propose\nmeasuring the intensity of infrared signals between portable\ndevices on surfaces. The aim of using infrared technology\nis to achieve fine-grained location and orientation sensing\nat little additional cost, size, or complexity to user devices,\nwhile still avoiding reliance on pre-installed infrastructure.\n3. Prototype Implementation\nFigure 1 shows the implementation which has six-\nteen infrared emitters, twelve infrared receivers and addi-\ntional components including analog multiplexers and fil-\nters, power circuitry and a microprocessor. The twelve pho-\ntodetectors each cover 30\u00b0 and the emitters 22\u00b0, therefore\nthe angle measurement errors should be limited to \u00b115\u00b0 or\n\u00b111\u00b0 respectively. Additionally, the wireless platform parti-\ncle computer 1 was used to organize the distributed control,\nsynchronization and exchange of measurements. It is impor-\ntant to note that these prototypes were designed to facilitate\nflexibility, in order to fully gauge the potential of infrared\ntechnology for fine-grained, surface-based positioning. The\nmeasurements are based on a series of short (each 250\u00b5s)\ninfrared pulses. The receivers include analogue filters and a\n10bit 35kHz A\/D Converter. A single pair-to pair measure-\nment between two devices for any range up to 250cm and\n360\u00b0 coverage takes 600ms in the current implementation.\nThe emission and reception of infrared pulses is organized\nin a one-to-many style. Many objects can measure their in-\n1 http:\/\/particle.teco.edu\ncoming signals while only one object emits pulses. This im-\nproves the scaling behavior when the number of objects in-\ncreases.\nFigure 1. Infrared device prototype\n3.1. Location and orientation algorithms\nAs different devices emit infrared pulses and receiving\ndevices measure and broadcast their results, angles of emis-\nsion\/reception and inter-device ranges can be gathered for\npairs of devices on the surface. Two methods for estimat-\ning the relative locations and orientations of the devices are\npresented here.\nMap tracing. A collection of the distance and angle\nreadings reported can be used to construct a virtual map,\nwhose nodes represent devices and whose segments repre-\nsent the distance and angle measurements between the de-\nvices. The map is then processed as follows:\n1. Choose one device as the reference for the coordinate\nsystem.\n2. Call a device with measurements towards another de-\nvice as connected to it.\n3. Use trigonometry and the distance\/angle readings of\ndevices connected to the reference device and place\nthose devices on the map. Mark the already placed de-\nvices as \u201cvisited\u201d.\n4. Choose a node which has not been visited, and cal-\nculate locations and orientations for any devices con-\nnected to it which has been placed already. Place the\nnew node as well and mark it as \u201cvisited.\u201d\n5. Repeat the previous step until the location and orienta-\ntion for all devices in the map are calculated.\nThus, the algorithm traces the map to estimate the relative\nlocations and orientations of the devices. The advantage of\nthis method is that it is computationally lightweight; the\nmap tracing algorithm can be executed in real time, even us-\ning a modest microcontroller such as the PIC employed in\nthe prototype.\nNon-linear regression. Alternatively, the angle and\nrange measurements can be used to arrive at a solu-\ntion for the relative locations and orientations of the devices\nusing a system of equations.\nMore specifically, taking device i and j, with locations\n(xi, yi) and (xj , yj), the euclidean distance dij between\nthem is:\ndij =\n\u221a\n(xi \u2212 xj)2 + (yi \u2212 yj)2. (1)\nAlso, the emission or reception angle \u03c8ij at device i with\nrespect to device j can be related to \u03b8i, the orientation of de-\nvice i referenced to the arbitrary coordinate system being\nused by the relative positioning system\n\u03c8ij = \u03c6ij(xi, yi, xj , yj)\u2212 \u03b8i, (2)\nwhere \u03c6ij is the angle of the vector drawn from device i to\ndevice j, as shown in figure 2. As indicated in the equation,\n\u03c6ij is a function of the locations of the devices i and j, and\ncan be calculated using trigonometry.\n\u03c6 ij\nDevice i\nAngle of\nvector from\ni to j\nDevice j\n\u03b8 i of device\nOrientation\ni\n\u03c8ij\nAngle of device\nwith respect to device i\nj\nRelative positioning coordinate axes x\ny\nFigure 2. Device angle relationships\nSince the devices in the system report measurements of\nthe distances dij and the angles \u03c8ij , a non-linear regres-\nsion algorithm can be applied to arrive at estimates for the\ndevices\u2019 relative locations and orientations on the surface.\nThe regression process converges toward location and ori-\nentation estimates which minimise the sum of the squares of\nthe residuals (i.e. the difference between devices\u2019 measured\ndistances and angles, and the distances and angles as calcu-\nlated using equations 1 and 2). The solution can be further\nrefined by using Studentized residuals to identify distances\nand angles which are likely to have large errors, and re-\npeating the regression with those measurements discarded.\nThese techniques have previously been shown to work well\nin positioning systems [18].\n4. Experiment and Discussion\nThis section presents a characterisation of the distance\nand angle measurements from the prototype devices, and\nthe resulting location and orientation estimates. The practi-\ncal utility of such a system for mobile users is then evalu-\nated. For the test setting, four prototype devices were placed\nin one hundred different configurations on a 160 \u00d7 200 cm\nsurface indoors. For each configuration, the locations and\norientations of the devices were arbitrarily chosen, with the\naim of achieving an even distribution of locations and ori-\nentations over all the test configurations. Ambient light dur-\ning the experiments came from overhead fluorescent lights\nand indirect sunlight.\n4.1. Distance and angle accuracy\nFigure 3 shows the error characteristic of the distance\nand angle measurements taken by the devices. Ninety per-\ncent of the distance measurements were within 18 cm. Al-\nthough the chosen photodetectors each covers a fairly broad\nangular range, the beam intensity of the emitters used in the\nprototype is greatly attenuated when the emitter is turned\nby ten degrees or more. When a receiving device does not\nlie within the main lobe of sensitivity of any of the trans-\nmitting device\u2019s emitters, measurements become less accu-\nrate. A simple software model to compensate for this was in\nplace on the devices.\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nError (centimetres or degrees)\nPe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\n o\nf m\nea\nsu\nre\nm\nen\nts\n w\nith\n e\nrro\nr l\nes\ns \nth\nan\n a\nbs\ncis\nsa\nDistance\nReception angle\nEmission angle\nFigure 3. Raw measurement accuracy\nAs shown in figure 3, the ninetieth percentile angular ac-\ncuracies for reception and emission are 25\u00b0 and 15\u00b0, respec-\ntively. These deviate from the ideal limits stated in section 3\nbecause the infrared transducers sensitivity beam is not per-\nfectly aligned on the manually assembled prototypes\n4.2. Location and orientation accuracy\nThe measurement data for the experiments was fed into\nthe map tracing and non-linear regression algorithms to\nproduce relative location and orientation estimates. In or-\nder to compare the algorithms\u2019 results with the manually-\nmeasured locations and orientations, a coordinate space\ntransform was calculated for each result. The coordinate\nspace transform consists of the 2D rotation and translation\nwhich minimise the mean squared distance error between\ncorresponding devices. The accuracy of the resulting loca-\ntions and orientations are shown in figure 4, and the nineti-\neth and ninety-fifth percentile accuracies are given in ta-\nble 1. Note that of the two algorithms, non-linear regres-\nsion achieves superior accuracy, but both algorithms have a\nlocation accuracy better than that of the raw distance mea-\nsurements provided by the devices.\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nAlgorithm error (centimetres or degrees)\nPe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\n o\nf r\nes\nul\nts\n w\nith\n e\nrro\nr l\nes\ns \nth\nan\n a\nbs\ncis\nsa\nLocation error (regression)\nLocation error (map tracing)\nOrientation error (regression)\nOrientation error (map tracing)\nFigure 4. Algorithm accuracy distributions\n4.3. Evaluation\nBased on the findings with the prototype system, this\nsection evaluates the use of infrared technology for fine-\ngrained positioning of mobile users\u2019 devices on surfaces.\nAccuracy. The location and orientation accuracy of the\nsystem is largely suitable for the types of applications out-\nlined in section 2.1, such as configuration of device con-\nnections, automatic interface export, and location-sensitive\ndata sharing between meeting attendees.\nUpdate rate and scalability. In the current hard-\nware prototypes, each device\u2019s transmission sequence takes\n600 ms. With some modifications this can easily be re-\nduced to less than 200 ms per device.\nIf line-of-sight between devices on the surface is mini-\nmal, then it may be necessary for all devices to transmit in\norder to uniquely solve for their locations and orientations.\nAssuming a transmission duration of 200 ms and poor line-\nof-sight conditions on a surface with twenty objects, po-\nsitioning updates would be available approximately every\nfour seconds. Although this would be awkward for users\ndesiring fast, automatic connection and data sharing, in our\nexperiences with surface-based systems, line-of-sight con-\nditions are rarely so poor, and positioning updates are often\nfeasible after only three or four devices report their mea-\nsurements. Although only four infrared devices were con-\nstructed, it has been experimentally verified that the wire-\nless protocol employed by the devices\u2019 radio units will sup-\nport twenty or more devices in simultaneous operation.\nEnvironmental factors. The reflectance of the surface\non which the devices are placed affects the received in-\nfrared light intensity. Although the devices perform simi-\nlarly on typical desks and work surfaces, extremely shiny\nsurfaces (such as glass) or absorbent surfaces (such as a\nblack tablecloth) can cause additional ranging errors. Ad-\nditionally, direct sunlight is crucial to the receivers used on\nthe prototypes. section 2.1, mobile users rarely choose sur-\nfaces which are in direct sunlight, since it makes device dis-\nplays difficult to read. Also, a set of informal experiments\nhave shown that e.g. additional automatic calibration can\ncompensate for ranging errors on unusually reflective or ab-\nsorbent surfaces.\nPower Consumption. The prototypes have an aver-\nage power consumption of 300mW when actively generat-\ning measurements. The biggest part of this relatively high\npower consumption is used up by the infrared circuitry. Ap-\npropriate redesigns can easily reduce this amout to less\nthan 50mW by e.g. reducing the pulse length of the in-\nfrared light pulses.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have proposed a new type of position-\ning system for portable devices placed on surfaces. The sys-\ntem uses intensity measurements of infrared pulses trans-\nmitted between devices to determine their relative loca-\ntion and orientation. Unlike previous surface-based location\ntechniques, the system is not reliant on any pre-installed in-\nfrastructure and thus provides a more practical solution for\nthe surface-based computing tasks of mobile users. The pro-\ntotypes (figure 1) were designed to fully gauge the poten-\ntial of infrared for surface-based positioning. Clearly, they\nare too unwieldy and complex for everyday use as mobile\ndevices. For a consumer electronic device, the number of\ntransducers could be vastly reduced by choosing infrared\nemitters and detectors which have much wider sensitivity\nbeams. We developed a lightweight map tracing algorithm\nand a more robust non-linear regression algorithm which es-\ntimate device locations and orientations using distance and\nangle measurements collected from the devices.
