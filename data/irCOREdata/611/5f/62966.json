The \nprolonged feeding period provides ample time for inflammation \nto promote haemostasis at the feeding site. Host immune mech-\nanisms may reduce the feeding success of ticks by enhancing \ninflammatory reactions. Ticks have developed mechanisms to \nsubvert the host response, presumably as an adaptation to obtain \nlarger bloodmeals that would result in increased tick fitness. In \nparticular, the saliva of ticks has anti-inflammatory and immu-\nnosuppressive properties ( Brossard & Wikel, 2004 ). \n The host response to foreign antigens requires the co-ordinated \naction of innate and acquired components of the immune system, \nwhich is regulated by small secreted proteins known as cytokines \n( Borish & Steinke, 2003 ). Cytokines are a diverse group of solu-\nble messenger proteins involved in the activation, growth, control \nand repair of cells, and regulation of immune events. Chemok-\nines, a sub-set of cytokines, play an important role in controlling \nleucocyte migration. In previous studies, saliva and\/or salivary \ngland extract (SGE) of ixodid (hard) adult tick species was shown \nto bind numerous cytokines (interleukin-2, IL-4 and some impor-\ntant chemokines) and suppress the activity of immune cells that \nare responsive to their stimulation. Results varied between spe-\ncies, and also between adult males and females of the same spe-\ncies ( Gillespie  et al. , 2001 ;  Hajnick\u00e1  et al. , 2001, 2005 ). \nManipulation of the host cytokine network by ticks provides a \nmechanism to help ticks feed and may also facilitate tick-borne \npathogen transmission ( Nuttall & Labuda, 2004 ). \n The nymphal stage is often the most important in tick-borne \npathogen transmission. Several studies have shown that nym-\nphal feeding induces changes to host haemostatic and immune \nresponses, with some evidence of differences between nymphs \nand adults ( Brossard & Wikel, 2004 ;  Narasimhan  et al. , 2007 ; \n Pedra  et al. , 2007 ). To determine whether nymphs have immu-\nnomodulatory mechanisms similar to adults, we compared anti-\ncytokine activity in SGEs prepared from nymphs of four ixodid \ntick species,  Dermacentor reticulatus ,  Ixodes ricinus ,  Rhipi-\ncephalus appendiculatus  and  Amblyomma variegatum , all of \nwhich are important vectors of tick-borne pathogens ( De Vos, \n1981; Camus & Barre, 1992 ;  Nambota  et al. , 1994 ;  Hubalek \n et al. , 1997 ;  Labuda & Nuttall, 2004 ;  Foldvari  et al. , 2005 ; \n Kelly, 2006 ;  Sreter-Lancz  et al. , 2006 ;  Skarphedinsson  et al. , \n2007 ). The materials and methods used followed those de-\nscribed in our previous studies with adult ticks (Hajnick\u00e1  et al. , \n2005;  Van \u010d ov\u00e1  et al. , 2006 ). \n5\n Immunomodulatory arsenal of nymphal ticks \n K .

As anti-cytokine activity of ixodid species is most \nconsistently detected after feeding commences but prior to en-\ngorgement, nymphs were collected when they had completed \napproximately 2  days of feeding (Van \u010d ov\u00e1  et al. , 2006). \nApproximately 300 partially fed nymphs of each species were \ncollected and SGEs prepared as described previously ( Slov\u00e1k \n et al. , 2000 ). The total amounts of protein from 10 nymphs ob-\ntained from two independent feeding sessions were 2.8  \u0001 g and \n3.9  \u0001 g in  D. reticulatus , 5.1  \u0001 g and 3.5  \u0001 g in  I. ricinus , 5.5  \u0001 g \nand 6.8  \u0001 g in  R. appendiculatus , and 11.6  \u0001 g and 9.7  \u0001 g in \n A. variegatum . Pooled SGE was prepared as 10, 5, 2.5, 1 or \n0.5 nymphal equivalents per 5  \u0001 l. Salivary gland extracts were \nscreened by ELISA for activity against human CXCL8, CCL2, \nCCL3, CCL5, CCL11, IL-2 and IL-4 using commercial ELISA \nkits obtained from R&D Systems (Xxx ) and\/or Bender MedSys-\ntems Diagnostics (Xxx ), as described previously, with duplicate \nassays of each sample (Hajnick\u00e1  et al. , 2005). The results \nrepresent the means obtained with the two batches of SGEs \nderived from independent feeding sessions. A reduction in the \ndetectable level of a particular cytokine, compared with the con-\ntrol, was interpreted as evidence of putative cytokine binding \nactivity. \n The SGEs of all the nymphal species reduced the level of \nCXCL8 (Fig. 1). The highest levels of inhibition were shown by \n R. appendiculatus  and  D. reticulatus . Thus there was no correla-\ntion between the total protein content of SGE from each species \nand the levels of inhibitory activity ( D. reticulatus  had the low-\nest protein content and  R. appendiculatus  the second highest). \nRelatively high activity against CCL2, CCL3 and CCL11 was \nobserved in  R. appendiculatus  and  A. variegatum  nymphs, \nwhereas activity was barely detectable in  D. reticulatus  and \n undetectable in  I. ricinus . Only  A. variegatum  showed signifi-\ncant levels of activity with CCL5. Anti-IL-2 activity was de-\ntected in SGE of  I. ricinus  nymphs and low levels of activity in \nSGE of  D. reticulatus  nymphs, whereas anti-IL-4 was demon-\nstrated in SGE of  I. ricinus  and  R. appendiculatus . Thus nymphs \nof four ixodid tick species showed contrasting patterns of anti-\ncytokine activity after 2  days of feeding on rabbits. Similar re-\nsults were obtained using murine (rather than human) cytokines \n(data not shown), reflecting the high degree of amino acid iden-\ntity between mammalian cytokines and the likelihood that anti-\ncytokine activity is effective irrespective of (mammalian) host \nspecies. \n For  I. ricinus  and  A. variegatum , nymphal anti-cytokine pro-\nfiles were similar to those recorded for adults, whereas adult  D. \nreticulatus  showed a much greater repertoire of anti-cytokine \nactivity compared with conspecific nymphs ( Table  1 ). The dif-\nferences between species and between stages may reflect differ-\nences in host preference. However,  I. ricinus  has probably \nthe most catholic  \u2018 taste \u2019 , but appears to have the poorest anti-\ncytokine repertoire. An alternative explanation may be that \nanti-cytokine activity reflects the size of the mouthparts and\/or \nthe duration of feeding. For example,  A. variegatum  has \nlarge mouthparts that penetrate deep into the dermis, and takes \na comparatively long time to reach engorgement ( Stewart  et al. , \n1998 ). The mechanics and physiology of  A. variegatum  feeding \nmay antagonize different cytokines to those provoked by a spe-\ncies such as  I. ricinus , which has much smaller mouthparts and \nengorges faster. \n Soon after tissue damage, specific leucocyte subsets emigrate \nfrom the circulation into the affected area. These leucocytes \nfunction as the primary line of host defence in the destruction of \nmicro-organisms and initiation of tissue repair. The histopatho-\nlogy of tick-bite lesions shows that, depending on the tick spe-\ncies and host species, the predominant cells infiltrating \nattachment sites are neutrophils (in mammals) or heterophils (in \nnon-mammals), eosinophils and basophils ( Latif  et al. , 1990 ; \n Szabo & Bechara, 1999 ;  Van der Heijden  et al. , 2005 ). Neu-\ntrophils are the first infiltrating cell type in the dermis; their mi-\ngration to inflammatory sites is directed by the chemokine \nCXCL8. The molecular structure of CXCL8 has been deter-\nmined for various vertebrate species and shown to be similar. \nIndeed, the most ancient chemokine, found in a primitive group \nof vertebrates, resembles mammalian CXCL8, indicating high \nconservation of this chemokine since the evolution of early ver-\ntebrates ( Najakshin  et al. , 1999 ). The chemotactic ability of hu-\nman CXCL8 is not species-specific; granulocytes from many \nvertebrate species migrate to this chemokine  in vitro  \n( Rot, 1991 ). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils inform and shape \nimmune responses. Thus it is perhaps not surprising that all the \nixodid species and stages showed anti-CXCL8 activity, presum-\nably indicating the importance to ixodid ticks of controlling \nneutrophil activity. Even adult female  A. variegatum , which has \nlow anti-CXCL8 activity at 5  days of feeding, shows compara-\ntively higher activity earlier in feeding (Van \u010d ov\u00e1  et al. , 2006). \n The CC chemokines have pleiotropic activities; they are po-\ntent attractants for monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, natural \nkiller cells and memory T cells ( Laing & Secombes, 2004 ). The \nimportance of cells of the host immune system infiltrating the \ntick feeding site resides in their ability to produce cytokines that \nmodulate the downstream response ( Falcone  et al. , 2001 ). Sub-\nversion of the activity of the four CC chemokines examined \nappears important for the two larger nymphal species, \n R. appendiculatus  and  A. variegatum. \n Because of the relatively long duration of tick blood- feeding, \nticks must suppress host immune reactions at all levels. The \nmain function of IL-2 is to stimulate the growth and cytotoxic \nresponse of activated T lymphocytes. In addition, IL-2 is impli-\ncated in the development, homeostasis and function of natural \nkiller cells. For nymphal  I. ricinus  in particular, the results \nsuggest the importance of suppressing one or more of these \nfunctions. \n The adaptive immune system has evolved two types of im-\nmune cells, Th1 and Th2, as the system supervisors ( Kidd, \n2003 ). Th1 cells are predominantly involved in the type-1 path-\nway of cellular immunity, whereas Th2 cells drive the type-2 \npathway of humoural immunity. Th2 differentiation is a central \nprocess in the protection against parasites such as helminths. \nTick infestation also results in a Th2 immune response, as \nshown by the cytokine profile induced in murine lymph node \ncells ( Ferreira & Silva, 1999 ). IL-4 is a key cytokine in the in-\nduction of Th2 immunity, mediating B-cell activation.

As the Th2 cells mature \nthey also produce IL-4, which generates an autocrine loop to the \nna\u00efve T cells to make more Th2 cells. As for IL-2,  I. ricinus \n nymphs appear to target IL-4, suggesting they manipulate the \nTh2 response. When fed on laboratory mice,  I. ricinus  nymphs \ninduce a Th2 response, but do not elicit a host rejection response \n( Brossard & Wikel, 2004 ). However, on natural hosts,  I. ricinus \n nymphs induce resistance in  Apodemus flavicollis , although not \nin  Clethrionomys glareolus  ( Dizij & Kurtnebach, 1995 ). Thus \nthe interplay between tick-induced manipulation of host innate \nand acquired immunity, and Th1 and Th2 responses, for differ-\nent host species, is highly complex. Identification of the tick \nmolecules active in cytokine manipulation is needed to help un-\nravel this complexity. \n The importance of disrupting the host cytokine\/chemokine \nnetwork is demonstrated by the many  \u2018 large \u2019 DNA viruses that \nproduce cytokine\/chemokine inhibitors ( Deane  et al. , 2000 ; \n Webb & Alcami, 2005 ). Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) \nare  \u2018 small \u2019 RNA viruses (with one exception, African swine fe-\nver virus) and appear to exploit the immunomodulatory proper-\nties of their vector \u2019 s saliva ( Nuttall & Labuda, 2004 ). Our results \nshow that even nymphal ticks, which epidemiologically are gen-\nerally more important than adults as vectors of arboviruses (and \nother tick-borne pathogens), produce a wealth of cytokine\/\nchemokine inhibitors. Such important immunosuppressors will \nneed to be considered in designing novel vaccines that target \nticks and block arbovirus transmission. \n Acknowledgements \n This study was supported by the Slovak Research and Develop-\nment Agency (contract no.
