The framework proposed comprises four key domains of vocational action, \nvocational reflection, liberal reflection and liberal action. The framework enables the \nproblems of curricula that are over-focused in one part of curriculum space to be \nsurfaced. It also enables the case to be made, and the content outlined, for a tourism \nhigher education which educates philosophic practitioners.

Undergraduates are studying tourism in ever \nincreasing numbers (Airey 1997). But curriculum studies for higher education in \ngeneral, and tourism in particular, are not well developed. The nature of graduateness, \nand the principles underpinning the development of tourism degrees are under-\ntheorised. For example in the UK, The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher \nEducation (QAA) (QAA 2000) has recently published benchmark statements for a \nnumber of degree subjects including tourism. But there is no discernible theoretical \nunderpinning to accompany these benchmarks (Tribe 2000b). This paper addresses \nthis shortcoming by its focus on one key question - By what principles should the \nvocational tourism curriculum be ordered? \n \nIt may be thought that the purposes of a vocational curriculum in tourism are self-\nevidently to equip graduates to operate in their chosen career. But this is to overlook \nan important feature of big industries like tourism. For as well as generating consumer \nsatisfaction, employment and wealth, these industries leave their imprint on the world \nin other ways. They forge a distinctive industrial landscape and cause profound \nchange in patterns of social and economic relationships. \n \nA special burden is therefore placed on tourism education. For as economic prosperity \nand consumer satisfaction are generated from the development of tourism, changes to \npeople and place also occur. Actions to enhance the business of tourism produce \ndistant effects or externalities. A distinctive tourism society is affected and tourism \nworld (Tribe 1999) is constructed. This wide tourism society and world comprises not \njust tourists and tourism businesses but additionally any individuals, communities, \ngovernments and physical environments affected by tourism. \n \nSlagheaps and pneumoconiosis are part of the aftermath of previous waves of \nindustrial development such as coal mining. If the development of tourism is to avoid \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   1 \nthese kinds of externalities then curriculum elements designed to further the business \nof tourism must be complemented by elements to nurture tourism's wider society and \nthe developing tourism world. This paper links the aims of tourism higher education \nwith those of tourism's wider society so that the curriculum model proposed involves \nshaping tourism's society as well as serving it. This is in contrast to many other \ncurriculum recommendations (e.g. Holloway 1995; Koh 1995; QAA 2000; Shepherd \n1997) where curriculum aims are not explicitly addressed but which implicitly are \ndirected towards servicing the tourism economy. \n \nThe article is organised in the following way. First its methodology is outlined. Next, \nthe curriculum concept of the philosophical practitioner is clarified and the central \nframework is developed using the two axes of curriculum ends and curriculum stance. \nThe ends axis exhibits the tensions between vocationalism and liberalism whilst the \ntensions between reflection and action are exposed in the stance axis. Four key \nquadrants of curriculum space emerge and the characteristics of these quadrants are \nexplored. A critique of curricula which are overly concentrated in the extremes of the \nframework is made which prepares the ground for the full articulation of the concept \nof the philosophic practitioner. \n \nTHE PHILOSOPHIC PRACTITIONER: A CURRICULUM \nFOR TOURISM STEWARDSHIP \nMethodology \nIt initially needs to be asked what kind of research activity is underway in the \ndevelopment of a curriculum framework for higher education in tourism. This can be \nclarified by considering some instances of what is not being undertaken. The \ncurriculum question is not, for example, one of cause and effect. We can therefore rule \nout experimental methods. The curriculum world is a different one to Popper\u2019s (1959, \n1975) world of naturally occurring phenomena in the scientific world. Thus any solely \nscientific-empirical method is inappropriate. A model curriculum cannot be defined \njust by testing and measuring because it exists in the social rather than natural world. \nCurricula, as Young noted, \u201care no less social inventions than political parties or new \ntowns.\u201d (1971:24). Ontologically speaking a curriculum is not a natural phenomenon \nwhich exists independently of human thought, just waiting to be discovered like a new \nplanet or star. It is not therefore not just a matter of applying good observational skills \nor of devising the right instruments for its detection. \n \nIt is the aims and purposes of a tourism curriculum that are central to this article. \nTherefore the research methodology necessarily has a strong philosophical dimension. \nIndeed the method adopted consciously avoids the empirical on the grounds that the \nempirical may restrict our field of vision to what exists. Rather this article seeks to \ndiscover what might be. Lawton (1983, 1996), writing about curriculum design \nstressed the importance of an initial philosophical stage. This article follows Lawton's \ninjunction that philosophical questions about the aims of education and the meaning \nof a worthwhile education must be raised and addressed. The curriculum aims set out \nhere are those for achieving philosophic practitioners in tourism. Conceptual analysis \nis utilised to elucidate this term and the ideas underlying the concept - liberal tourism \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   2 \neducation, vocational tourism education, reflection and action in tourism - are \nanalysed. Differentiation type analysis (Soltas 1968) is used to clarify these concepts. \nThe curriculum concept of the philosophical practitioner \nThe term curriculum has taken on a variety of meanings (Cooper et al. 1994; Graves \n1983; Kerr 1968; Snyder 1971; Taylor and Richards 1985 and Young 1998). But for \nthe purposes of this paper the curriculum is defined as a whole programme of \neducational experiences that is packaged as a degree programme. Its constituent parts \nare a number of modules or courses, which in turn may be specified as a series of \nsyllabi or course contents.  \n \nThe curriculum can be filled with different knowledge, skills and attitudes. Students \nembarking on tourism courses take different educational journeys according to the \nway in which their curriculum has been framed. Different framings mean that students \nwill exit tourism courses with a variety of perspectives, attitudes and competences. \nThe idea of framing (Bernstein 1971) is useful to understand that curriculum design \ninvolves choice where some components are included, and others excluded. Foucault \n(1971) also draws attention to fact that educational sites perform a role in selecting \nwhich discourses are to be disseminated. It is common for universities to frame their \nown tourism curricula, but surprisingly little discussion exists in the tourism literature \nabout the aims and values that guide curriculum design. \n \nThe curriculum aims of the philosophic practitioner are to promote a balance between \na tourism education that satisfies the demands of business and one that satisfies the \ndemands of a more widely drawn tourism society and world. This curriculum uses \nknowledge from across the fields of tourism to encourage vocational competence \nbalanced by ethical competence. Its underpinning values are that a vocational \ncurriculum can provide improvement not only to the workings of business practices, \nbut also to the wider tourism world which is related to and partially formed by \nbusiness practices. This value may be described as tourism stewardship - a caring for \nthe industry but also for the world which the industry makes and on which it depends. \n \nThere are two dimensions to the curriculum framework for philosophic practitioners. \nThe first relates to that part of the world which is the focus of the curriculum. This is \nreferred to as the ends of the curriculum. The second dimension relates to how the \ncurriculum promotes engagement with these ends. This is referred to as the stance of \nthe curriculum. \nEnds and stance \nEnds are represented by an axis which describes for what purposes the tourism \ncurriculum is constructed and to what it is aimed. The ends of the tourism curriculum \ncan comprise on the one hand vocational ends, focused on tourism employability and \non the other hand liberal ends, focused on freedom of thought about tourism. These \nroughly coincide with ends which are closed and those which are open. The \ncharacteristics of knowledge and skills at the extremes of the ends axis are as follows. \nWhere ends are vocational, the purposes of tourism education are extrinsic. These \npurposes are the pursuit of knowledge or performing actions for the external uses that \nthese activities can be used for. There are special types of knowledge and actions that \nare valued here. A key influence on this part of curriculum space is performativity \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   3 \n(Lyotard 1984). For example knowledge is selected for the curriculum here in \nresponse to particular questions: \n\"The question...is no longer 'Is it true?' but 'What use is \nit?' In the context of the mercantalization of knowledge, \nmore often than not this question is equivalent to: 'Is it \nsaleable?' And in the context of power-growth: 'Is it \nefficient?' \" (Lyotard 1984:51) \n \nThis is knowledge that contributes to the efficiency of the business of tourism.  \n \nWhere the ends of the curriculum are liberal they are unconstrained. Knowledge and \nactions are judged appropriate for different reasons. Here there is an intrinsic \nmotivation and the pursuit of knowledge or actions themselves are their own ends. For \nexample, knowledge is not chosen for performativity but rather because it satisfies \nsome interests of the human mind. It may be knowledge which produces enjoyment, \nor which helps establish truths, or maybe knowledge which helps to progress an \nethical argument of good or just tourism. The complete axis of ends therefore \nrepresents a continuum of possible aims and a source of potential tensions in the \ntourism curriculum. \n \nStance is the axis which describes different modes of study and expression which the \ntourism curriculum promotes towards its ends. The alternative stances that can be \nadopted in tourism education are those of reflection and action. Reflection is a mode \nof study that takes place in the mind. Here it is a question of gazing at the tourism \nworld as lived, thinking about it and reviewing it. It is where: \n\"The good life for man is the life spent in seeking for \nthe good life for man.\" (MacIntyre 1985:219) \n \nIt is a stance which emphasises critiques and scepticism about tourism and is \ncharacterised by the use of evaluative terms such as truthfulness, rightfulness, \nappropriateness and goodness. It is in this cognitive mode of study where theories \nabout tourism may be constructed, understood, stated and mentally tested. One aspect \nof competence in the reflective mode therefore revolves around the ability to theorise \nabout tourism. But reflection here implies more than just theory mastery. It implies \nestablishing an intellectual position from which a range of competing theories and \nideas about tourism can be surveyed and brought into play. Reflection enables a whole \nseries of possible actions to be screened without having to practically test each. It also \nenables the basis for good tourism actions and interventions to be worked out. \n \nAction is a mode of expression that takes place in the tourism world. It is getting on \nwith things, involvement in aspects of tourism, doing, and engaging with the world as \nlived. The guiding principle of a curriculum for tourism action is effectiveness. \nWhereas reflection on tourism is relatively unbounded and can contemplate perfect \nsituations (for example Plato's forms (Plato 1987) and tourism utopias), action is \nbounded by the pragmatism of what can be achieved given the constraints of the \nphysical and the social environment. The complete axis of stance therefore represents \na continuum of approaches to the tourism curriculum ranging from the practical to the \ntheoretical. \n \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   4 \nHaving identified the dimensions of ends and stance underlying the curriculum \nconcept of the philosophic practitioner, the mapping of the concept is completed \nwhen these axes are placed alongside one another to form a matrix. This is illustrated \nin figure 1.  \n \nFigure 1. Ends and Stance \n \nThis matrix results in the identification of four key quadrants of the curriculum for \nphilosophic practitioners. These are vocational action, liberal action, reflective \nvocational and reflective liberal. Each quadrant is now considered in turn with an \nemphasis on the unique features of each. \nVocational action and reflection in tourism \nPring explains that: \n\"vocational preparation signifies the acquisition of \nskills, qualities, attitudes and knowledge that are judged \nto be impotant for the world of work.\" (1993:60) \n \nJust what this means for the tourism industry was identified by Haywood and Maki \n(1992) who found that the tourism industry valued practical and general transferable \nskills. Curriculum elements for vocational action that scored highly in Koh's (1995) \nstudy of tourism executives included communication skills, interpersonal skills, \ncomputer literacy, human resource management, managing service quality, marketing, \nmanagerial accounting, the travel industry and a practicum. \n \nPPnewf1.pub\n               \nStance \n  \n  \n  \nEnds \n  \nLiberal \n  \nReflective \n  \nLiberal \n  \nLiberal \n  \nAction \n  \nAction \n  \nReflection \n                \n                  \n  \n  \n  \nVocational \n  \n  \n  \nReflective \n  \nVocational \n  \n  \nVocational \n  \nAction \n  \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   5 \nBy vocational action we are here referring to the actions of those employed in the \ntourism industry. So, for example, the marketing of a destination or an attraction, the \nmanagement of a hotel or restaurant involve vocational actions. The aims and \nobjectives of vocational action are simply defined as preparation for effectiveness at \nwork. Its aim, to borrow Birch's (1988) terminology, is to enable students to become \noperational, and make a smooth transition into the world of work. Operational is used \nby Birch to signify an ability to perform in the commercial world and the types of \nknowledge and skills that underpin this kind of curriculum are mainly technical. In the \ndomain of pure vocational action, the individual is limited to the role of potential \nmanager and curriculum development involves the acquisition of specific vocational \nskills and knowledge and personal transferable skills for effectiveness at work. \nEffectiveness at work can include \"flexibility\" (Cooper and Shepherd 1997:42) and \n\"the right attitude\" (Cave 1997:7). \n \nIn the reflective vocational (Sch\u00f6n 1983) part of curriculum space there is an \nemphasis on reflection, evaluation and modification of tourism industry skills and \nknowledge. The development of individual or personal knowledge is encouraged. This \nis knowledge that is developed from experience and action in the world. Reflective \nvocationalism encourages the individual to personalise expertise and improve \nknowledge implicit in practices. The individual is encouraged to find his or her own \nvoice for development and critique of vocational action. Reflective vocationalists are \nencouraged to stand back from their actions so that they may be subjected to critical \nreview in the form of reflection-on-action. The point of this review is to evaluate \naction with a view to improvement and to evaluate differently constituted actions. \n \nThe territory of vocational reflection has been analysed in the work of Donald Sch\u00f6n. \nFor Sch\u00f6n the importance of reflection-in-action was to provide a continual dialectic \nbetween the world as theorised about and the world as encountered. The art and \nartistry of the professional is thus built up from increased experience. A continual \nreflection on the world of theory and the encountered world enables the development \nof highly personalised and contextualised knowledge and skills. This is the \ndevelopment of an understanding which results in the interpretation and expression of \ntheory and knowledge by the individual knower or practitioner. Vocational reflection \ncontemplates on whether a presenting case fits an individual's current stock of \ntheoretical knowledge. If not, he or she will consider how differences can be \nreconciled leading to a remodelling of personal knowledge. \n \nIn the tourism curriculum, there are several ways of promoting vocational reflection \nincluding the use of key or transferable skills, and work placements. For example \nMoscardo (1997) describes a concept of mindful managers for tourism which seems \nvery close to vocational reflection. Key or transferable skills can also be important. \nThe key skills of problem solving and flexible thinking are proposed by Moscardo as \ncrucial components to mindfulness and the paper endorses the effectiveness of a series \nof exercises designed to create mindfulness. Work placement can contribute to \nvocational reflection particularly when there is an opportunity to debrief students on \ntheir experiences. Busby, Brunt and Baber (1997:106) include \"the diagnosis and \nsolutions of problems\" as an important aim of placements for tourism students. \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   6 \nLiberal reflection and action in tourism \nThe term reflective liberal is used to denote the quadrant where the reflective part of \nthe stance axis meets the liberal part of the ends axis. Significantly, here reflection is \nnot confined to vocational situations as it is with Sch\u00f6n. There are no limits restricting \nthe ideas of liberal reflection whether they be set by the state, the education system, \nprofessional or business interests or indeed anyone. Creativity of thinking is allowed \nfor. All is possible and so liberal reflection describes an infinite space of possible \nideas. The three philosophical activities of attempting to uncover \"the truth\", a \nsustained scepticism about things and the search for \"the good life\" are central to most \ndefinitions of liberal education (Tribe 2000a) and these are all relevant to tourism. \n \nThe development of tourism knowledge and skills in this quadrant are assigned an \nopen role. For example the Oxbridge tradition of liberal reflection promotes liberation \nfrom falsehood and therefore its curriculum requirement puts the pursuit of truth as a \ncentral requirement. Here the study of tourism is not a matter of improved business \ntechnique but of understanding aspects of the phenomenon. Typically, disciplinary or \nmultidisciplinary modules are paramount here, for example geography of tourism, \nanthropology of tourism, sociology of tourism, economics of tourism and tourism \nsocial science. Such modules may also offer a sceptical view of tourism - but this may \nalso be achieved by specific modules such as critical tourism studies, where critique, \nideology, power and values are central. Here students are encouraged to find their own \nvoices and develop critical agendas. \n \nFor Goodlad a curriculum which promotes \"the good life\" demands that \"...some sort \nof facilitating activity is required ... offering students the opportunity ... to reflect on \nmatters of ultimate concern.\" (1995:26). Goodlad is advocating that some part of the \ncurriculum should develop the philosophical side of individuals, and encourage \nreflection on the meanings and purpose of life and in this case, the place of tourism in \nthis bigger picture. Similarly the notion of becoming was developed by Freire (1972) \nas a process of transcending the moment and the present, and looking above, out and \nahead to see what an individual or a society might or can become. Becoming therefore \ncarries with it visions of the future and considerations of utopia. It is through modules \nsuch as philosophy of tourism, and tourism ethics (Hultsman 1995, Walle 1995) \nthat \"the good life\" for tourism may be examined. \n \nSo the role of a reflective liberal curriculum is understanding and critical evaluation of \ntourism's society. Here is a conception of a curriculum which reflects upon tourism's \nworld and the ethical issues associated with it. However, liberal action requires the \nextra step of translating better understanding and critiques of the wider world of \ntourism into action. Here ethical and just treatment of people (Apple 1990) and place \naffected by tourism are essential. This action may herald changes at the individual \nlevel, but may also be changes at a societal level in the form of collaborative action \nwith others. The discourse of this quadrant of curriculum space therefore includes \nnotions of world-making and liberation. \n \nWorld-making assigns the curriculum a role in contributing to a changed tourism \nworld. Action in the liberal, as opposed to the vocational sphere of the curriculum is \ngiven an open interpretation. There are no a priori limits on the world to be made \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   7 \ntherefore action in this sphere is unconstrained. So liberal action opens up the prospect \nof freedom of action. Where action is unconstrained this allows for a freedom of \nthought in liberal reflection. But liberal action implies more than just free thought. For \nthis too can be limited to a case of creating a new world by reflection and keeping that \nnew world in one\u2019s head. In this respect Krippendorf criticised...  \n\"...the 'thinkers' who sit in their studies are political \nlightweights. Their recommendations will remain \npolitically anaemic theories as long as there is no \npressure on the politicians...\"(1987:107). \n \nLiberal action requires that steps are taken literally to help create a new world, or as \nFreire explains: \n\"...creating and recreating...deciding and choosing and \nultimately participating in society's historical process.\" \n(1972:30, my italics) \n \nLiberal action represents transforming action. It represents a kind of action in the \nworld which is distinct and different from Sch\u00f6n\u2019s (1983) reflective practice. Sch\u00f6n\u2019s \nreflective practice encourages reflection on action for improved action but is \nconstrained by its vocational setting. Liberal action has no such constraints. It \nencourages reflection on all tourism practices in a wider world. Its object is improved \ntourism practices and not just improved tourism business practices. Practical steps to \nencourage the development of liberal action might include work placement with \nethical tourism pressure groups (e.g. Tourism Concern), a module on the politics of \ntourism, a module on responsible tourism, and a philosophical practicum focused on \nthe achievement of liberal action in tourism. \n \nFinally liberation is a key aspect of liberal action. At a societal level, liberation has the \nmeaning of movement from one form of organisation of society to another, where the \nmove involves greater freedom for more people. This is an important consideration in \nbalancing the interests of hosts and guests in tourism. In achieving the potential of the \ncurriculum to fulfil its role as an agent for this kind of change Apple suggests the need \nfor curriculum theorists to: \n\"affiliate with cultural, political and economic groups \nwho are self-consciously working to alter the \ninstitutional arrangements that set limits on the lives and \nhopes of so many people in this society.\" (1990:166, \nitalics in original) \n \nSo at its most radical, liberal action may some times challenge institutional \narrangements of the business of tourism. \nCurriculum and ideology \nThe articulation of four distinctive quadrants of curriculum space provides a \nframework to enable critical review of tourism curricula. Problems of partial framings \ncan be seen in curricula that are over-concentrated in just one part of curriculum \nspace. In some cases curricula may demonstrate such a narrow conception that the \nproblem of ideology emerges. Indeed some key curriculum terms \u2013 operational, \ntechnical, vocational, liberal have been adapted to demonstrate the operation of an \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   8 \nideology. Hence we have the terms operationalist (Barnett 1994), technicist (Apple \n1990), vocationalist (Tapper and Salter 1978), idealist and liberalist when we refer to \na curriculum that is so narrowly driven by these aims that it admits no other purposes \nand the curriculum is insulated from other discourses. In these examples aims become \nstrict regimes so that knowledge and skills that do not further such aims are not \nadmitted into the curriculum. Regimes perform an act of closure on reflection and \naction. \nVocationalism and technicism \nConsider a tourism curriculum with an exclusive emphasis on vocational action, for \nexample the BA(Hons) Travel and Tourism Management at the University of \nNorthumbria, UK. The aims of this degree are: \n\"to prepare [students] for a management career within \nthe travel and tourism industry through a sound \neducation in the principles and practices of management \nin the industry and to develop a set of personal skills \nand management competences appropriate for \nmanagerial careers in the travel and tourism industry.\" \n(University of Northumbria 1997:182) \n \nThe overriding aim is to deliver graduates to work in the tourism industry. Key \nattributes are those of utility and relevance. The course is governed by extrinsic goals, \nand technical efficiency. It appears to include a socialisation role in terms developing \npersonal skills or what Dale (1985) referred to as \u201coccupational adjustment\u201d. \n \nA curriculum that is vocationalist legitimises a particular ideology characterised as \none where \"tourism is conceived of as a phenomenon which should be organised to \nbring profit to the organising enterprise and satisfaction to the paying tourist\". \nVocationalism limits those interests which enter the frame to those of employees in \nthe tourism industry and tourists and it is therefore essentially a reproductive \ncurriculum (Apple 1990) that supports, perpetuates and contributes to a narrow \ntourism society of consumers and producers. Under a vocationalist curriculum the \nexisting world is taken as given and attention is applied to action in this given world. \nMeans therefore take precedence over ends. Whilst means are honed, ends are taken \nfor granted and alternative ends (and thus a whole series of moves in corresponding \nmeans) are lost from view. A concentration on means produces tourism graduates who \ndevote their energies to the operationalizing of a blueprint which is given and the \ncurriculum provides the technical expertise to fulfil the business aspects of tourism. \nThis concentration on better technique (technicism) can mean that a view of the wider \ntourism world, embracing the critical and ethical, is lost. \n \nEven where a curriculum for vocational ends is extended to include a reflective \nvocational element it does not necessarily escape criticisms of partiality and closure. \nFor Schon's vocational reflection does not hold the whole tourism project up for \ncritical scrutiny. Vocational reflection does not escape world-taking. In the reflective \ndomain of the vocational tourism curriculum, reflection is limited to the area of \nbusiness actions. Reflective practice may encourage critique of these practices, but \neven the modified actions resulting from reflective practice will still be directed \ntowards business ends. Reflection is not permitted to generate a line of thinking that \ntakes it beyond the closed world of business actions. It is therefore not open reflection \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   9 \nbut operates under constraints. Reflective practitioners do not make the major move \nfrom the reflective to the philosophical. They do not engage in philosophical \nreflection about the ends of their vocational actions. They reflect largely within the \nconstraints of what is, and only consider the what might be from a technical \nperspective.  \nLiberalism and academicism \nJust as vocationalism implies closure so does liberalism. A tourism curriculum framed \nsolely for liberal ends may be criticised as one which has turned its back to the world \nof work. The M.A. in the Sociology and Anthropology of Travel and Tourism at the \nUniversity of Surrey, Roehampton, UK, illustrates such a course. \n \n\"The key areas of study in this course are Introduction to \nthe Sociology and Anthropology of Travel and Tourism; \nTourism and the Global Culture; Thesis Writing; \nTourism, Heritage & Environment; Space, Place and \nSociety; Tourism, Myth and Pilgrimage; Travel Writing \nand Media Representations; Dissertation.\" (University \nof Surrey Roehampton 2000:63) \n \nHere, liberal reflection as an exclusive focus for a curriculum can lead to different \nproblems of partiality coming close to what Goodlad has termed \"academicism\". \nGoodlad explains its shortcomings as follows: \n\"...it indicates a detachment of the individual (academic \nor student) from any realistic perception of what is \neither socially desirable or practically meaningful.\" \n(1995:28) \n \nIn fact The University of Surrey, Roehampton's largely reflective liberal curriculum \ndoes clearly consider social desirability with its emphasis on disciplinary insights \nfrom sociology and anthropology. But there appears to be little emphasis on \nknowledge or skills that have practical application and little preparation for course-\nrelated employment. Indeed there is the temptation in pure reflective liberalism to \nloose sight of the realities of having to make a living in the world. Truth seeking may \nbecome debilitating and students may seek refuge from the difficult realities of the \ntourism world in an arcane world of philosophising. \n \nThere are further criticisms of any curriculum that is located entirely in reflective \nliberalism. They are criticised by Birch for leading to closed-system tendencies which \nare explained as: \n\"...the propensities to operate largely from internally \ngenerated stimuli and to validate the responses within \nthe relatively closed circle of international scholarship.\" \n(1988:4) \n \nBirch is referring here to the existence of academic enclaves and ivory towers which \noperate in a parallel sphere insulated from, and unconnected to, the world of business. \nHere it is possible for the tourism world to be inspected at arms length, and for \nprognostications about that world to be made without regard to the practical realities \nof competitive business conditions. Theorising here is made easier because there is no \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   10 \nintention to make a move from the world of thought to the world of vocational \nactions. To counteract the influences of liberalism and academicism Birch urged that \nhigher education: \n\"must address itself to the extrinsic needs of society as \nwell as the intrinsic needs of scholarship...[and develop] \nthe operational notion that knowledge should be put to \nwork.\" (1988:64) \n \nThe Philosophic Practitioner \nRecent research points to the existence of partial and incomplete framings of tourism \ncurricula. For example Airey points out that \n\"Tourism education has come in for criticism in the past \nbecause of the extent to which courses have been \ndominated by thinking that is rooted in economics and \nbusiness studies.\" (Airey 1997:10). \n \nAdditionally, a study of tourism degree courses in the UK concludes that \n\"...course aims and objectives reveal that most of the \ncourses on offer are vocational in orientation and within \nthis business issues are normally well developed.\" \n(Airey and Johnson 1999:234) \n \nIt is as a response to issues of partial framings that the concept of the philosophic \npractitioner is developed, mapping a tourism education which is conscious of, and \nresponds to, wide aims for the tourism world. Vocational action is extended to include \nvocational reflection and liberal reflection is extended to encompass liberal actions. \nNow the philosophic practitioner clearly has stirrings of Sch\u00f6n's Reflective \nPractitioner (1983, 1987) in its title. It certainly builds upon Sch\u00f6n's model that \ninvites the curriculum to develop competent, but reflective practitioners. After all as \ntourists, we all want tourism services that are efficient, effective, innovative and \neconomical. But this new model deploys additional concepts which locate its tourism \ngraduates on a more philosophical plane than Sch\u00f6n, whilst at the same time requiring \nactive engagement with the world of tourism. \n \nThe elements of the philosophical practitioner curriculum can be found in figure 2 \nwhere the matrix that divides up curriculum space is revisited. Notice that a \nphilosophic practitioner would graduate from a curriculum that develops knowledge \nand skills in all four domains. Although the domains remain separated out for the sake \nof conceptual clarity, integration is to be aimed for in this curriculum model. \n \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   11 \n \nFigure 2. The Philosophic Practitioner \n \nA philosophic practitioner must have the potential to practise in the tourism industry. \nIt is the curriculum for vocational action that underpins the vocational, extrinsic aim \nof a tourism higher education and prepares the philosophic practitioner to operate \neffectively in an occupational role. So one element of philosophic practice entails the \nability to engage in high quality and competent actions in tourism operations. \n \nThe reflective part of the vocational axis is the initial point of departure from narrow \nvocational action towards philosophic practice. Here, a limited type of philosophising \nemerges that is reflection on vocational action. We may conceive of the reflective \npractitioner in the sense elaborated by Sch\u00f6n who alerted us to the gap between \nknowledge gained in an academic setting and the use of that knowledge in a practical \nsetting and the importance of reflection-in-action and the development of \n\"professional artistry\". Next, the term philosophic practitioner gains an important \naspect from liberal reflection and it is here that the philosophical part of the term \ncomes into fuller play. In this domain, philosophic practitioners need to develop \nknowledge and skills that will enable them to operate in a philosophical mode and \nrecognise the partiality of the world of operations and technical problem solving. \nTheir philosophical development would enable them to transcend this partial world \nand tune into the bigger picture with its complex world of tourism - both the business \nand non business domains of the phenomenon of tourism - by utilising a broader range \nof tourism knowledge. The formulation of critiques of this bigger world of tourism - \ntourism's society - becomes a major task for the reflective liberal. \n \n               \nStance \n  \n  \n  \nEnds \n  \nLiberal \n  \nReflective \n  \nLiberal \n  \nLiberal \n  \nAction \n  \nAction \n  \nReflection \n                \n                  \n  \n  \n  \nVocational \n  \n  \n  \nReflective \n  \nVocational \n  \n  \nVocational \n  \nAction \n  \nThe \n  \nPhilosophic \n  \nPractitioner \n  \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   12 \nSo the philosophic practitioner in liberal reflection may view tourism from the \nperspective of different disciplines, to extend the view from a mainly business \nposition and to adopt an anthropological view, a philosophical view, a sociological \nview or an environmental view. The reflective liberal will venture far beyond Sch\u00f6n \nand engage in discourses that scrutinise the \"what is\" and compare it to the \"what \nmight be\". These are not just discourses concerned with profitability (though these \nmay certainly be important), and not just those related to the improvement of a \nproduct or service. Rather, any discourses that concern the whole world of tourism, \nwithout presupposition, may be engaged in. \n \nWhilst sustained critical thinking is central to liberal education, it is a fourth domain \ncontaining the concept of liberal action which completes the curriculum framework \nfor the philosophic practitioner. Liberal action refers to the sense in which the \nphilosopher can do more than philosophise. Thus the term implies not just the \npractising of philosophy, but also the putting into action of the fruits of such \nphilosophising. This means not just stopping at the point where the world is seen in a \ndifferent way. It implies getting out of the philosopher's armchair and engaging in \naction. The philosopher (operating just out of a liberal reflective curriculum) might, \nhaving constructed a mental conceptual and analytical map of a particular problem, \nsee that problem in a new light. But the litmus test of liberal action is action and \nachievement of change. Liberal action might include lobbying for a particular cause, \npressure group or other political activity. But liberal actions are not confined to \nsituations external to occupations. Liberal activists can be the conscience and \ninstigators of ethical action within the workplace. The hallmarks of liberal activism \nare knowing-in-action and practical wisdom. This is promoted by the cultivation of \njudgement and good action for the community. Barnett notes that: \n\"Institutions of higher education can become a \nmicrocosm of the rational society, a reminder to society \nof what society itself might be.\" (1990:121) \n \nAnd this demonstrates clearly the difference between reflective and active liberalism. \nFor liberal action does not just remind society how tourism might develop for the \nbetter, but seeks to participate in the process of achieving betterment. \n \nAt first glance there seems perhaps little that is novel in the proposal for the \nphilosophic practitioner. Specifically in tourism education there already exist modules \non responsible tourism and environmental tourism for example. More generally in \nhigher education, curriculum theorists have long argued that vocational elements need \nto be balanced with liberal elements. Indeed writers such as Silver and Brennan (1988) \nhave suggested that many degree courses do in fact achieve this aim and deliver a \nliberal vocationalism. Additionally, as Barnett notes, higher education as a whole does \nprovide coverage across curriculum space so that it: \n\"produces technicist, managerial and economic \nideologies for society; and it produces critical ideologies \n- e.g. ecological, feminist, deconstructionalist and \nhumanistic ideologies - consciously counterpoised \nagainst the former set.\" (1990:71) \n \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   13 \nBarnett's observation captures a key challenge for the philosophic practitioner. This is \nrelated to the idea of partiality of the curriculum and the problem of academic division \nof labour. This division of labour, alluded to by Newman (1853), has resulted in a \nspecialisation where the higher education system can produce managers, and \naccountants separately from sociologists and philosophers. There are technicist \ncurricula that aim to deliver means to achieve given ends and critical curricula that \nhold ends up for critical scrutiny. What is missing is a synthesis of critical thinking \ninto vocational courses as an antidote to technicism. Equally a synthesis of vocational \nrealism into purer critical thinking courses is missing allowing critical thinking to \nignore its relationship to the working world. \n \nNow this synthesis may be difficult to achieve and several writers have rehearsed the \nbarriers to this kind of integration. For example, Cotgrove (1983) has described how \nthese different camps represent different paradigms. Following Kuhn's (1970) notion \nof paradigms we may conclude that different paradigms have their own internal logic \nand procedures, each of which is alien to the other. Becher's (1989) concept of \nAcademic Tribes adds weight to this idea of division in its description of academic \ncommunities that form tight groups with agreed rules. Additionally the condition \ntermed by Lyotard (1988) as a differend has relevance here. The case of a differend \narises when there is no discourse or tradition common between two parties and a lack \nof agreed rules therefore prevents each party from engaging with the other. \n \nThe principles underpinning the development of a curriculum for philosophic \npractitioners are summarised in table 1. The concept offers a way of unifying these \ndiscrete traditions and engaging with the problem of the differend. The aim of this \ncurriculum will be to develop a common agenda and a shared language so that a \nnumber of dualisms are bridged. This would encourage communications first between \nthose operating in the business world of tourism and those in its non-business world, \nand second, between those in the lived world of tourism (tourism actions) and those in \nthe thought about world of tourism (tourism reflections). An associated effort is also \nnecessary to tackle the dualism where fact and values are separated so that both facts \nand values are given space in the curriculum.  \nAims and roles \nPhilosophic practitioners will be firmly rooted in the world of day-to-day vocational \nactions, aiming to be competent and efficient, but also able to operate beyond this \nnarrow world of practice. The twin aims of philosophic practitioners are therefore to \ndeliver better tourism services and to contribute to the construction of a better tourism \nworld and therefore to learn how to work in tourism and for tourism. MacIntyre's \n(1985) observation that modernism has led to the partitioning of human roles points \nup the challenge for philosophical practice. This is to develop and seek to reconnect \ntwo key roles that have become separated. These are the roles of the occupational \nperson in tourism and the responsible person overseeing and participating in tourism \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   14 \nTable 1. The philosophical practitioner \nAims better tourism service \nbetter tourism world  \nRoles occupational competence \nstewardship for tourism \nEnds vocational: consumers and producers \nliberal: stakeholders and places \nStance reflection \naction \nEpistemology business interdisciplinarity \nextradisciplinarity \nmultidisciplinarity \ngeneral interdisciplinarity \nknowing in vocational action \npractical wisdom \nRationality technical  \ncommunicative \nIdeology to be exposed (e.g. vocationalism, academicism) \nIssues and values an unbounded view of tourism's world, including tourism \nsatisfaction, efficiency, profit, effectiveness, productivity, \nenvironment, justice, equality, aesthetics, ethics, culture and \nhistory \nTourism interests tourism's society: tourists, business and non-business interests \n \nIt is complementary role development for occupational competence and responsibility \nthat provides for this. Stewardship is a potent idea where philosophic practitioners \nassume the responsibility for promoting the well being of tourism's society and world \nand not just the profitability of individual firms. Stewardship is a term borrowed from \nenvironmentalism. It implies the long term care of tourism, making sure that it is not \ndamaged or mis-used. Management of externalities is central to stewardship. This \nimplies watchfulness of the use or development of tourism with regard to the \nconsequences of its exploitation to a range of stakeholders. These stakeholders include \ndirect users, indirect users, and future generations. Stewardship implies an active and \nnot just a passive stance to developments so it is a key component of liberal action. Of \ncourse stewardship needs to incorporate occupational role development in tourism, so \nthat the hard realities of earning a living are not overlooked. \nEnds and stance \nThe idea of ends and the importance of visioning alternative ends is central to the idea \nof the philosophic practitioner. Here the business ends implicit in vocationalism and \nthe free ends contemplated in liberalism are each given due weight. Additionally, the \nnotions of tourism's society and the tourism world signal the elevation of the status of \npeople and place to be included as significant ends of the tourism project. This is a \ncrucial difference in emphasis first from vocationalism where people and place are the \nmeans to achieving the ends of business profitability and consumer satisfaction and \nsecond from liberalism where ends may be constructed without consideration of \npragmatic means. \n \nRegarding stance, Arendt (1958) noted that those involved in thought and those \ninvolved in action had taken different paths, and it is this separation of reflection and \naction that presents a further challenge to philosophic practice. The term itself clearly \ncarries a commitment to avoid either action which is not subject to reflection or \nreflection which does not have some recourse to action. It is the development in \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   15 \nstudents of an awareness of knowing in action, and reflection before, in and after \naction both for vocational and liberal ends that is important to achieve the full \npotential of philosophical practice. \n \nThis linking of reflection and action enables the nuances of action specific to \nphilosophic practitioners to emerge. A curriculum for philosophic practitioners \npromotes two meanings of action. Arendt (1958) described a change in the meaning of \nactions from the Aristotelian notion of actions which have goods internal to \nthemselves, to the modern usage of action as making things or fabrication. \nFurthermore, MacIntyre (1985) suggested that good practices in the Aristotelian sense \nhave been marginalised. A vocationalist curriculum is one which promotes actions as \nfabrication. A curriculum for philosophical practitioners embraces this usage of the \nterm but extends usage to the Aristotelian sense. It promotes a background dialectic \nbetween the good action as an efficient and effective vocational action and the good \naction as one which measure up to some ethical standards of goodness for the tourism \ncommunity. So reflection here provides an ethical check on actions. \nEpistemology and rationality \nThe epistemological key to the curriculum for philosophic practitioners is that \nknowledge is used from the whole field of tourism studies (Tribe 1997). The \nimportance of this, is that business interdisciplinary knowledge and extra-disciplinary \nknowledge exert a dominance over vocationalist tourism studies. This kind of \nknowledge creation is motivated by the profit motive and what Lyotard (1984) \ndescribed as performativity. To use the geneticists' metaphor, business \ninterdisciplinarity represents a dominant gene - it is the grey squirrel of tourism \nstudies. A curriculum for philosophic practitioners balances this knowledge with \nmultidisciplinary and general interdisciplinary knowledge. It is this crucial balance \nthat equips students with the knowledge breadth that enables a free analysis of the \ntourism phenomenon to take place. The student is freed from the kind of partial \nknowledge perspective that limits and constricts understanding of the tourism \nphenomenon. \n \nCommunicative reason (Habermas 1989, 1991) represents an important contribution \nto decision making in addition to technical rationality for philosophic practitioners. \nThere is a tendency to favour technical rationality in vocational tourism using \nquantitative tools. Market prices are used where they exist and for those tourism \naspects which are unpriced \u2013 for example the preservation of a building, the use of a \nforest for recreational purposes, or the preservation of a view - shadow prices are \nallocated. This move enables quantitative decision-making equations to be made \nbased on a comparison of numerical values (normally the costs and benefits of a \nscheme based on monetary values). The attractiveness of these schemes is that they \ndispense with arguments based on language which are difficult to weigh up and \ncompare and replace them with a series of equations. Decisions are then made based \non the ordering of options according to their numerical result. Of course the very \nsimplicity of this approach belies many of the assumptions that have to be made to \nallow for that simplicity. Against this tradition, philosophical practitioners would \npromote communicative rationality for decision making where the situation demands \nit. The richness and complexity of decision making is allowed and aesthetic and \nethical factors are not translated crudely into numeric equations but given their full \nvoice through the language system despite the difficulties of comparing arguments. \nThe Philosophic Practitioner   16 \nIdeology, issues and interests \nJust as Habermas (1978) noted the relationship between knowledge and human \ninterests, curricula can serve different interests too. The important issue for the \ncurriculum for philosophical practitioners is to avoid domination by any particular \ninterest. Philosophic practice is an antidote to vocationalism where business and \nconsumer interests can be so exclusive as to amount to an ideology which controls the \ntourism project. Equally the philosophic practitioner curriculum allows no retreat into \nother ideologies such as liberalism, or Marxism. No partial curriculum is admissible \nso that no act of closure can be imposed by the curriculum. It is the conscious \ncompetition encouraged in this framework between the major interests of tourists, \ntourist business, other stakeholders and the physical environment that guards against \nideology. Interests and values are not just profit (vocationalism) or tourism \nsatisfaction (hedonism) or ecology (environmentalism) or equality (socialism) but \npluralistic. This offers the prospect for the business of tourism to develop within a \nwider ethical framework where a range of values is given due weight. Multiple values \nchallenge the situation where \"managers...conceive of themselves as morally neutral \ncharacters whose skills enable them to devise the most efficient means of achieving \nwhatever end is proposed\". (MacIntyre 1985:74). \n \nA final question: How will a philosophical practitioner negotiate the world as lived? \nHaving been educated under such a framework it might be that a graduate finds work \nas a marketing manager for a major airline. The philosophic practitioner will engage \nin vocational action to establish a marketing position, for example, that will beat the \ncompetition and gain more custom. Vocational reflection would be deployed which \nmight lead to a constant dialogue with colleagues to review and improve this strategy. \nIt would promote an interplay between conceptual schemes and practical experience \nthat result in continual, adaptive learning. However, at the same time, liberal \nreflection might lead to a recognition that the environmental effects of increased air \ntraffic are becoming more and more serious. \n \nSo the philosophic practitioner may then seek to operationalise a solution to such \ndiscovery, perhaps by joining a pressure group, perhaps by lobbying against the \nconstruction of a runway in an environmentally sensitive area or by offering \nalternative strategies to related problems arising at work. A philosophic practitioner \nmay work within a given value system whilst at the same time perhaps working to try \nto change some of the values of that system. What is sought is the development of \npractical wisdom and action in the wider tourism world at the same time as earning a \nliving in, and contributing to the economic development of a specific business domain \nof tourism. This is working in tourism whilst taking responsibility for stewardship of \nthe developing world of tourism. \n \nCONCLUSION \nA key task of this paper has been to locate tourism actions in two contexts. These are \nvocational tourism, with an emphasis on instrumental action governed by values of \nproduction, and that of liberal tourism where values and ends are more open. \nCombining these two contexts has delivered the full complexity of the tourism world \nupon which action can be taken. The other key task has been to promote the notion of \nreflection. Here, the juxtapositioning of reflection and action for vocational and non-\nThe Philosophic Practitioner   17 \nvocational ends enables Sch\u00f6n's narrow conception of reflective practice to be \nextended so that the concept which is the title of this paper - the philosophic \npractitioner - emerges fully. \n \nIn conclusion, philosophic practitioners in tourism will be able to sell themselves in \nthe market place as productive employees. Society expects its workforce to be well \ntrained, and expects to recoup its investment in higher education in terms of enhanced \neconomic performance. But any deep consideration of the term society surely moves \nbeyond society-as-consumers-and-producers, and generates questions about what kind \nof tourism society we want to develop. The philosophic practitioner curriculum is \ndesigned to satisfy the labour market, to satisfy consumer wants, and to promote \neconomic welfare. It is also designed to create a reflective workforce to further the \ndebate about the destiny of the tourism world and an active workforce to create a \ntourism society that has been thought deeply about. It will intervene in the simple, yet \npotentially dangerous cycle of reproduction of the world \"as is\" where students learn \npassive adaptation to the tourism world that exists (Minogue 1973). It will contribute \nto the task of tourism world-making. The philosophic practitioner offers a curriculum \nwhich plays up students' future role in stewardship as well as employment. The result \nis that people in tourism's society and place in the tourism world become ends as well \nas means in the project of tourism and the vocational world of tourism is situated in, \nand coupled to, the wider tourism life-world. Philosophic practitioners would think \nand act for tourism world-making. \n \nAcknowledgement \u2013 The author would like to thank Ronald Barnett, Dean of \nProfessional Development, Institute of Education, University of London, for \ncomments on this paper. \n \nReferences \nAirey, D. \n1997 After 25 Years of Development: A View of the State of Tourism Education in \nthe UK.
