Introduction \n \nThe public use files of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) are the primary data \nsources used for investigating trends in the distributions of individual earnings and of \nhousehold income in the USA, as well as for undertaking cross-national comparisons \ninvolving the USA. The consensus of this research is that earnings and household income \ninequality increased substantially during the 1970s and 1980s.  This growth in household \nincome inequality outpaced that seen in most other OECD countries and by the early 1990s \nthe USA had the highest level of inequality among 19 OECD countries in the Luxemburg \nIncome Study (Gottschalk and Smeeding [32]).5   \n More recently, researchers using public use CPS data have found that the growth in \nwage inequality slowed in the 1990s (Card and Dinardo [21], Lemieux [44], and Autor, Katz, \nand Kearney [8]). However, in contrast to the findings for wage inequality, there are \nconflicting views about whether inequality in income continues to increase in the USA.  \nGottschalk and Danziger [33], using public use CPS data and measuring inequality by the \nratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile (the P90\/P10 ratio), find that the rise in \nincome inequality among their sample of working age adults slowed in the 1990s, which is \nsimilar to the pattern they find for wage inequality. However, others argue that the growth in \nUS income inequality has continued unabated. Most prominent among them, Piketty and \nSaez, using data from US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administrative records, report \nsustained growth in the income share of the richest 10% of tax filers throughout the 1980s to \n                                                 \n5 For systematic reviews of the cross-national inequality literature, see Atkinson, Rainwater and Smeeding [7], \nGottschalk and Smeeding [32], and Atkinson and Brandolini [3] regarding household income inequality and \nGottschalk and Smeeding [32] and Acemoglu [1] regarding earnings inequality. For examples of the use of the \npublic use CPS in measuring inequality trends in the USA, see Burkhauser, Couch, Houtenville and Rovba [15], \nand Gottschalk and Danziger [33] regarding household income inequality, and Katz and Murphy [40]; Juhn, \nMurphy, and Pierce [38], and Card and Dinardo [21] regarding earnings inequality. \n 2 \n1998 ([49], Figure 1).6 Since the P90\/P10 ratio by definition does not capture changes in the \nupper tail of an income distribution, the results of Piketty and Saez are not necessarily \ninconsistent with the findings of Gottschalk and Danziger if, for instance, growth in \ninequality slowed in the middle of the distribution but continued to rise in the upper tail. But \nif it is the case that most of the changes in US incomes have been within the upper tail, then it \nsuggests that public use CPS data may not be of much value in capturing inequality change in \nthe distribution, especially if inequality is measured using the P90\/P10 ratio.  \n One reason Gottschalk and Danziger and other researchers use P90\/P10 ratios to \nmeasure inequality rather than measures that capture dispersion throughout the entire \ndistribution (like the Gini coefficient) is that topcoding in public use CPS data has made it \ndifficult to consistently observe changes at the top of the distribution.7 \nPiketty and Saez\u2019s approach avoids this limitation of public use CPS data by using \nIRS data on \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 made available to the research community in grouped \nform. But these data also have limitations. Because the share of Americans paying personal \nincome taxes has varied greatly over time, researchers like Piketty and Saez usually only look \nat the share of taxable income accruing to the top income earning groups and do not consider \ntrends in inequality measured over all income groups.8 In addition, critics of the use of these \ndata for measuring trends in income inequality point out that tax filers are sensitive to \nchanges in personal income tax rate. So tax-rate changes since the 1970s which have \n                                                 \n6 Updated tables from this paper are available on Saez\u2019s website [55]. The updated data show that with the \nexception of a decline in inequality from 2000\u20132002, this inequality growth has continued through 2006, their \nlast available year of data.  \n7 Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins [16] show that even P90\/P10 ratios do not completely overcome the problem of \ntopcoding in the CPS data because CPS topcoding is done for each of its sources of income. They find a \nsignificant minority of persons below the 90th percentile of the household income distribution have some source \nof their own income or of another household member\u2019s income that is topcoded. \n8 Since the overrepresentation of top income earners in the tax-filing population is not unique to the USA, top \nincome shares are the standard approach used in international tax-records based analyses of inequality as well.  \nSee, for example, Piketty [48] for France, Atkinson [2] for the UK, Saez and Vaell [56] for Canada, Bach, \nCorneo and Steiner [9]  for Germany, Dell [26] for Germany and Switzerland, and Atkinson and Leigh [4] for \nAustralia. Atkinson and Piketty [5], Leigh [43], and Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez [6] provide comprehensive \nreviews of the literature using tax records to measure long-term inequality trends. \n 3 \nprovided incentives for the very rich to switch their reported income from Subchapter-C \ncorporation profits, which are not reported on personal income tax forms, to S-corporation \nprofits and personal wage income, which are reported.  This shift would then overstate the \nactual rise in inequality among the very rich.9 For a flavour of the heated debates on this topic, \nsee the blog postings by leading economists and others on the Economists View website [28]. \n In this paper, we address the topic of US income inequality trends in a different and \ndistinctive way. While we use public use CPS data as many previous researchers have, we \nalso employ the more complete internal Census Bureau versions of the CPS data that provide \nconsiderably more information about the incomes of those at the top of the income \ndistribution. With these better data, we are able to confront the problems of topcoding in the \npublic use CPS data more directly.10 Access to internal data also means that we are able to \nuse broad-based measures of inequality that are sensitive to changes at the top of the income \ndistribution (unlike percentile ratios such as P90\/P10). So, for the first time, we are able to \nmeasure long term inequality trends for the complete distribution of income in the USA, \naccounting for the experience of both individuals in the upper tail of the distribution and \nthose farther down.  \n Topcoding arises because the US Census Bureau is required to protect the \nconfidentiality of CPS respondents. For each source of income received by an individual \nabove a source-specific amount (the \u2018topcode\u2019), the public use data made available to the \nresearch community contain the topcode rather than the reported income value. However, \nofficial statistics reported by the US Census Bureau [59] on mean income and income \n                                                 \n9 See Slemrod [58] and Reynolds [53] for a fuller discussion of the \u2018tax elasticity\u2019 issue in the Piketty and Saez \n[49] data, and Feenberg and Poterba [29] for a more general discussion of the problems of measuring income \ninequality using income tax records. \n10 Another issue bedeviling analysis of trends is the change in the CPS data collection design, especially the \nchange to computer-assisted personal interviewing between calendar years 1993 and 1994. We refer to these \nlater. \n 4 \ninequality are based on internal data from the March CPS that are much less severely \ncensored. We use these internal data too.  \n Given that it is the predominant dataset for United States income statistics, this paper \nand much of the earlier research on topcoding focuses on the March CPS.  However, issues of \nconfidentiality make topcoding of income a necessity for most national datasets both in the \nUS and internationally and researchers using these data employ similar techniques to those \nused by those using March CPS data.11  For instance, in the USA, the National Longitudinal \nSurvey of Youth (NLSY97) topcodes some of its income sources as does the Panel Study of \nIncome Dynamics (PSID), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), and the \nAmerican Community Survey (ACS). In Great Britain, in order to comply with the 2007 \nStatistics and Registration Services Act, the Annual Population Survey and the Quarterly \nLabour Force Survey have introduced topcodes on earnings data in their main public release \nfiles.  In numerous countries including Germany, Austria, and the United States, the wage \ndata that are available from social insurance or social security administrative registers are \nright censored at the earnings level corresponding to the upper limit to social insurance \ncontributions.12   \nWe analyze trends in the inequality of size-adjusted pre-tax post-transfer household \nincome in the USA using the March CPS between 1975 and 2004, comparing the estimates \nderived from three data series and both public use and internal CPS data. Our first series, \nwhich we label Internal-Unadjusted, is based on the internal data used \u2018as is\u2019, i.e. using \nincome data among which the prevalence of topcoding is substantially lower than for public \n                                                 \n11 For example Gottschalk and Smeeding [32] consistently topcode cross-national data in the Luxemburg \nIncome Study at 10 times the median reported income for each country, Pischke [50] sets topcoded incomes in \nthe SIPP to the topcode threshold, and Lubotsky [46] sets topcoded incomes in US Social Security Earnings \nRecords to 1.38 times the topcode threshold. \n12 Other datasets, such as the International Society Survey Program collect income information in income bands \nrather than as a continuous variable.  This poses a similar challenge to topcoding of a continuous income \nvariable when assigning income to the open-ended top income band.  Similar techniques to those used for \ncorrecting for topcoding, such as assigning a multiple of the top-band\u2019s threshold, are often used when handling \ndata of this structure. See e.g. Kahn [39]. \n 5 \nuse data. The second series, labeled Public-CellMean, uses cell means from the internal data \nto impute values for topcoded incomes in the public use data. That is, using internal data, we \nhave derived a cell mean series in which topcoded incomes in the public use data, for each \nyear back to 1975, are replaced by the mean of all income observed above the topcode for \nany income source of any individual in the public use data that has been topcoded.13 This cell \nmean series can be used in conjunction with cell means provided by the Census Bureau for \n1995 onwards to create a set of cell means for topcoded observations that covers the whole \nperiod. See Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng, and Zayatz [41] for these cell mean values and for \na detailed discussion of the procedures used to create them. \nThe estimates of mean income and of income inequality for the US private household \npopulation that we derive using our Public-CellMean series closely match the corresponding \nestimates that we derive from internal data.14 If the internal data contained complete \ninformation about the topcoded incomes, then the cell mean approach would almost \ncompletely mitigate the biases in estimates that are due to topcoding. However, the internal \ndata are also censored both out of concern about the accuracy of some high income responses \nand to reduce volatility in income statistics resulting from random sampling error among \nthese top earners.  While censoring in the internal data reduces the volatility of income \nstatistics, this censoring is problematic since it causes the internal CPS data to understate the \ntrue level of income at the top of the US income distribution.  Additionally, since increases in \nthe internal censoring thresholds have not been performed systematically, the variation in the \nfraction of the population censored over time may also bias the trends in income held by \n                                                 \n13 Each CPS survey measures income from the previous calendar year. In this paper, all references are to the \nincome year, so when we discuss the year 1975, this refers to income from various sources that members of the \nhousehold received in 1975 reported at the March 1976 Current Population Survey interview.  \n14 In 2006, we were granted permission to use the internal March CPS to test the sensitivity of measured income \ninequality in the public use CPS. We were given access to internal March CPS records from 1975\u20132004. These \ndata include information on income above the public use topcode thresholds for respondents in the March CPS \nsurvey up to the processing limit in the March CPS data. The internal March CPS data the Census Bureau uses \nto produce the statistics in its official Census publications are subject to these same processing limits. However \nthese processing limits are lower than the data collection limits for income in the March CPS, which are the \nlimits on the actual values collected in the March CPS.  \n 6 \nthese individuals. Consequently, the internal censoring that exists in the internal March CPS \ndata used for official Census Bureau estimates and for our Internal-Unadjusted series is \nexpected to understate the level and misstate the trends in US income inequality. \n Our third data series, labeled Internal-MI, accounts for this issue of censoring in the \ninternal data. We use a multiple imputation approach in which, for each year, values for \ncensored observations in the internal data are multiply imputed using draws from a \nGeneralized Beta distribution of the Second Kind (GB2) fitted to internal data. Using this \nInternal-MI series, we investigate the extent to which the inconsistent exclusion of the top \npart of the distribution affects estimates of the level and trends in inequality. We find that, for \nevery year, inequality estimates from the Internal-Unadjusted series are lower than the \ncorresponding estimates derived from the Internal-MI series. However, the two series reveal \nthe same trends: the upward trend in US income inequality that began in the mid-1970s \nslowed down markedly after 1993.  \nIn the next section, we explain the nature of censoring in the CPS public use and \ninternal data in greater detail, and explain the derivation of the Public-CellMean, Internal-\nUnadjusted and Internal-MI series. At the heart of the paper, Section 3, are comparisons of \nestimates of income inequality derived from these series. Section 4 presents a summary and \nconclusions. \n Throughout the paper, income is defined in a conventional way. Income is pre-tax \npost-cash-transfer household income excluding capital gains, adjusted for differences in \nhousehold size using the square root of household size.15 Each individual is attributed with \nthe size-adjusted income of the household to which he or she belongs. Income refers to \n                                                 \n15 We follow the same procedure for generating size-adjusted household income as discussed in Burkhauser and \nLarrimore [19].  These procedures, particularly the use of the square root of household members to adjust for \nhousehold size are standard in the international comparative income distribution literature: see for instance \nAtkinson, Rainwater and Smeeding [7]. Its use is increasing in studies of US income distribution trends. See \nBurkhauser, Couch, Houtenville and Rovba [15], Gottschalk and Danziger [33], and Burkhauser, Osaki, and \nRovba [20]. \n 7 \nincome for the calendar year preceding the March interview. We convert the small number of \nnegative and zero household income values each year to one dollar prior to our calculations \nbecause a number of inequality indices are defined only for positive income values. Our \nsamples for each year are all individuals in CPS respondent households, excluding \nindividuals in group quarters or in households containing a member of the military. All \nstatistics are calculated using the relevant CPS sampling weights. \n \n2. Censoring in the March CPS  \n \n2.1 Topcoding in CPS public use data \nIn the March CPS, a respondent in each household is asked a series of questions on the \nsources of income for the household. Starting in 1975, respondents reported income from 11 \nsources and since 1987 they have done so for income from 24 sources. These income sources \ngo well beyond labor market earnings and include numerous non-labor earnings sources such \nas interest, dividends, social security income, and unemployment payments. See Appendix \nTable 1 for a list of these income sources. Rather than simply topcoding high total household \nincome values in the public use data, the US Census Bureau topcodes the high values of each \nsource of household income. See Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng and Zyatz [41] for a full list of \ntopcode thresholds used over time in the public use data. Prior to 1995, the Census Bureau \nassigned the topcode threshold from that source of income to all topcoded income values in \nthe public use data. Since 1995, the Census Bureau has substituted a cell mean value derived \nfrom the internal data to each topcoded value in the public use data. An additional \ncomplication is that household income is the aggregation of multiple income sources (income \ntypes and household members), each of which may be topcoded. As a result, the prevalence \nof topcoding in household income is significantly greater than for any particular income \n 8 \nsource, and topcoded household income values are not necessarily the highest incomes \u2013 they \nmay occur throughout the income distribution. \nBecause the Census Bureau cell mean series starts in 1995, using the public use data \nwithout correcting for this major change in the values imputed to the highest incomes, source \nby source, results in a significant increase in measured income and income inequality in 1995 \nand subsequently simply because of the closer correspondence between the true reported \nincome and the value included in the public use file. Hence, not taking this improvement in \nmeasurement into account overestimates how much actual income increased in 1995 among \nthose at the highest income levels and also overestimates the level of income inequality.  \n The major change in the public use data in 1995 is a specific example of the more \ngeneral problem that income topcoding presents. Topcodes in the public use data have \nincreased in a non-systematic manner over time, and part of the apparent trend in average \nincome and income dispersion in uncorrected data is caused by topcoding capturing a larger \nportion of the income distribution.16  \n Despite the Census Bureau\u2019s attempt to alleviate the problem of topcoding, their cell \nmeans have generally been ignored by researchers studying US income distribution trends for \nperiods spanning the 1990s since to do otherwise would exacerbate time-inconsistencies that \narise from using unadjusted public use data for the pre-1995 period and CPS data with cell \nmean imputations thereafter.  \n Researchers have typically followed two strategies to deal with the CPS topcoding \nissues. First, they have focused on the P90\/P10 ratio as the summary measure of inequality, in \nthe belief that this largely insulates them from topcoding problems.17 Burkhauser, Feng, and \n                                                 \n16 See Levy and Murnane [45] for an early review of the income distribution literature and a more formal \nstatement of this problem. \n17 Gottschalk and Danziger [33], Gottschalk and Smeeding [32], and Daly and Valletta [24], for example, use \nP90\/P10 ratios to measure US income inequality. Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce [38], Dinardo, Fortin, and Lemieux \n[27], Lemieux [44], and Autor, Katz, and Kearney [8] use P90\/P10 ratios to examine US labor earnings \ninequality.   \n 9 \nJenkins [16] show that using the P90\/P10 ratio does not completely alleviate CPS topcoding \nproblems, since incomes are topcoded by income source (not by total income) and so there \nare topcoded incomes below the 90th percentile of size-adjusted household income. \nAdditionally, the P90\/P10 ratio is based on just two income values, and so captures different \naspects of the income distribution than widely-used measures of dispersion such as the Gini \ncoefficient or other indices summarizing income differences throughout the income \ndistribution.  \nSecond, instead or as well, researchers have used \u2018consistent topcoding\u2019 methods, i.e. \nthey have ascertained the quantile of the income distribution at which topcoding bites in the \ndata for each of the years being studied, and then applied the minimum of these topcodes \nconsistently across all the years.18 Consistent top coding is useful because it is consistent by \nconstruction, but it is limited because it also implies that a substantial range of the income \ndistribution is simply ignored, and arguably it is at the top of the distribution where many of \nthe recent changes have been occurring (cf. Piketty and Saez [49]).19 In this paper, we eschew \nuse of consistent topcoding and the P90\/P10 ratio in favour of methods that take greater \naccount of top incomes (exploiting access to CPS internal data) and use a range of \ndistributionally-sensitive inequality indices (the Gini coefficient and three members of the \nGeneralized Entropy class of indices).  \n \n                                                 \n18 Gottschalk and Danziger [33] apply consistent topcoding methods. See also Burkhauser, Butler, Feng, and \nHoutenville [14], Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [30], and Burkhauser, Oshio, and Rovba [20].  \n19 Until recently, consistent topcoding was the best method available for dealing with topcoding, as it allowed \nresearchers to analyze a consistent fraction of the population. However, two recent events have led consistent \ntopcoding to become a less useful correction method (which is why we do not report our findings based on its \napplication in this paper). The first event is the rise in the fraction of the population that is topcoded on any \nsource of household income, which reached almost 6% in 2006. As a result of these increases in topcoding, \nconsistent topcoding means that researchers consider a decreasing fraction of the population.  Second, and more \nimportantly, is the recent availability of a superior alternative \u2013 cell means for topcoded incomes back to 1975 \nprovided in Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng and Zayatz [41]. However, while the cell-mean series allows \nresearchers to successfully mimic results from the internal data, for those interested in what is happening for the \nentire distribution, including those with incomes greater than the internal data censoring points, it is necessary to \nuse more sophisticated techniques such as those described in this paper. \n 10 \n2.2 Censoring in the internal CPS data \nUsing public use data with cell mean imputations (the Public-CellMean series) cannot solve \nthe problem of censoring entirely, because the internal data from which the cell means are \nderived are themselves censored, albeit to a lesser degree than the public use data. As was the \ncase in public use data prior to 1995, any censored observations in the internal data are \nreported as having source income equal to the censoring threshold.  \nThis censoring in the internal data originated due to limits on the number of digits \nprovided for responses on the survey questionnaire and early electronic data records.  Until \n1985, responses for each income source were limited to just 4 or 5 digits.  However, after the \nCensus Bureau processing systems were upgraded in 1985 to allow for responses with more \ndigits, this censoring persisted with two justifications.  The first is a concern about the \naccuracy of these high responses and the possibility for a recording error to have a substantial \nimpact on inequality statistics.  The second justification is that the small number of very high \nincomes may lead to wide swings in income statistics from random sampling error depending \non which high earners are selected for the survey in any given year.  Thus, to limit the effect \nof high income outliers on inequality statistics, the Census Bureau has maintained some \ndegree of internal censoring in all years of the survey.20  See Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng \nand Zayatz [41] for a full list of internal censoring thresholds over time and see Ryscavage \n[54], Jones and Weinberg [37], and Burkhauser, Butler, Feng and Houtenville [14], for earlier \ndiscussions of the problems of censoring in the public use and internal data.   \nThe trend in the percentage of individuals with censored size-adjusted household \nincome in the public use and internal data is provided in Figure 1. Although the percentage of \nindividuals with topcoded income in any given year is generally substantially lower in the \n                                                 \n20 Since internal censoring impacts not just research based on the internal CPS data but also that based on the \npublic-use data using cell-means, the Census Bureau could alleviate many of the censoring concerns without \ncompromising respondent confidentiality by providing a cell-mean series using the uncensored collection limits \ndata to supplement the currently produced cell-means based off of the processing limits data. \n 11 \ninternal data than in the public use data, the number of people in the internal data affected by \ncensoring is non-negligible. The fraction is typically around 0.5% of the population, and has \nbeen rising slowly since 1985. \n<Figure 1 near here> \nBecause we had access to the internal CPS data, we are able for the first time to \ncorrect for censoring in these data back to 1975, and hence provide a more consistent \nmeasure of trends in the income distribution and compare these trends with those found in \neither the public use or the unadjusted internal data. \n \n2.3 A Multiple Imputation Approach \nTo correct for censoring and also capture income dispersion across the whole distribution, we \ndevelop a procedure to impute values to incomes that are censored in the internal CPS data. \nThis yields the Internal-MI series.  \n We use a parametric model of the income distribution since, by definition, the \u2018true\u2019 \nuncensored underlying income in the internal data are not available to us. Unlike most \nprevious methods used to estimate topcoded incomes which led to a single imputation for \neach topcoded value, we derive multiple imputed values using a suitable randomization \nprocedure which leads to multiple distributions for each year, and account for potential \nstochastic imputation error by averaging estimates (hence the label \u2018multiple imputation\u2019). \nThe parametric model of the income distribution used for the imputation model is the \nGeneralized Beta of the Second Kind (GB2). The GB2 distribution has a probability density \nfunction \n[ ] 0,)\/(1),(\n)(\n1\n>\n+\n=\n+\n\u2212\ny\nbyqpBb\nayyf qpaap\nap\n (1) \nand cumulative density function (CDF) \nF(y) = I( p, q, (y\/b)a \/ [1 + (y\/b)a] ), y > 0, (2) \n 12 \nwhere parameters a, b, p, q, are each positive. B(p, q) = \u0393(p)\u0393(q)\/\u0393(p + q) is the Beta \nfunction, \u0393(.) is the Gamma function, and I(p, q, x) is the regularized incomplete beta \nfunction also known as the incomplete beta ratio. Parameter b is a scale parameter, and a, p, \nand q are each shape parameters.  The GB2 distribution is a flexible form widely used in the \nincome distribution literature, and a number of studies have shown that it fits income \ndistributions extremely well across different times and countries: see e.g. Bordley, McDonald \nand Mantrala [12], Brachmann, Stich and Trede [13], Bandourian, McDonald, and Turley \n[10], and Jenkins [34]. Feng, Burkhauser, and Butler [30] fitted GB2 distributions to labor \nearnings using public use CPS data and argue that their Gini coefficients calculated from the \nfitted GB2 distributions provide more plausible estimates of inequality trends than do the \nGini coefficients derived from unadjusted internal data reported by the Census Bureau.  The \nflexible nature of the GB2 distribution also incorporates many other distributions as special \ncases.  For example, the Singh-Maddala (Burr type 12) distribution is the special case of the \nGB2 distribution when p = 1; the Dagum (Burr type 3) distribution is the special case when q \n= 1; and the lognormal distribution is a limiting case.  For details, see McDonald [47] and \nKleiber and Kotz [41].  In addition, the GB2 becomes Pareto-like as income becomes \nincreasingly large (Shluter and and Trede [57] 164, fn. 11).  \nOur multiple imputation approach differs from earlier studies that used parametric \nmodels to derive imputed values for topcoded incomes: see Fichtenbaum and Shahidi [31] \nand Bishop, Chiou, and Formby [11].21 First, those authors fitted a one-parameter Pareto \ndistribution to the upper ranges of the income distribution, rather than the more flexible four-\nparameter GB2 model. Second, our approach takes account of the fact that, rather than being \ncommon to all individuals, censoring levels vary across individuals (because censoring is \n                                                 \n21 Piketty and Saez [49] also use Pareto distributions to perform parametric interpolation in the upper tail of the \ndistribution, although they do so to estimate the average income level of each of their income groups rather than \nestimating the share of income allocated to topcoded individuals. \n 13 \ndone at the level of each income source rather than at the level of aggregate household \nincome). Third, by using multiple imputation methods, rather than a single imputation, we \naccount for the variability intrinsic in the imputation process.   \nOur multiple imputation approach involves five steps. First, for each year\u2019s data, we \nfit a GB2 distribution by maximum likelihood, accounting for individual level right-censoring. \nIn fitting the GB2 distribution, we model individual household size-adjusted income at the \naggregate level, not for each income source separately. Doing so the other way would require \nmodeling the joint distribution of 24 income sources (11 before 1987) for various members of \neach household and, as a result, our approach is more parsimonious and tractable. To ensure \nthat model fit is maximized at the top of the distribution, the GB2 is fitted using observations \nin the richest 70 percent of the distribution only (using appropriate corrections for left \ntruncation in the ML procedure).22 We specify the sample log-likelihood for each year\u2019s data \nas \n\u2211\n= \uf8fe\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u2212\n\u2212+\u2212\n=\nN\ni\niiii\ni zF\nyfcyFcwL\n1 )(1\n)](ln[)1()](1ln[\nln  (3) \nwhere i = 1,\u2026, N, indexes each individual sample observation, wi is the sample weight for i, \nand ci = 1 if i is an observation with a right censored household income value, and ci = 0 \notherwise. The denominator of the expression adjusts for left truncation: z is the income level \ncorresponding to the left truncation point.  \nSecond, for each observation with a censored income, we draw a value from the \nincome distribution that is implied by the fitted GB2 distribution.  Given the fitted GB2 CDF, \n)(\u02c6 yF , the corresponding CDF for each topcoded observation i is, using standard formulae for \ntruncated distributions: \n)](\u02c61\/[)](\u02c6)(\u02c6[)(\u02c6 iiii tFtFyFyG \u2212\u2212=  (4) \n                                                 \n22 The 30th percentile was chosen as the left truncation point after experiments balancing goodness of fit with \nease of maximization. \n 14 \nwhere ti is the topcode for i, and yi is the \u2018true\u2019 value for that observation (which we are \nunable to observe). Letting ui = )(\u02c6 iyG , and inverting the expression for the income \ndistribution among topcoded observations, we have  \n( ))(\u02c6)](\u02c61[\u02c6 1 iiii tFtFuFy +\u2212= \u2212 . (5) \nA value of yi for each topcoded observation is generated by substituting into this \nexpression a value of ui equal to a random draw from a standard uniform distribution.  Since \nuncensored observations are observed, this imputation is only used to estimate censored \nobservations and the actual values of uncensored observations are used directly in all \ncalculations. \nThird, using the distribution comprising imputations for censored observations and \nobserved incomes for non-censored observations, we estimate our various inequality indices. \nFourth, we repeated steps 2 and 3 one hundred times, and finally, we combine the one \nhundred sets of estimates from each of the one hundred data sets for each year using the \n\u2018averaging\u2019 rules proposed by Rubin [52] and modified by Reiter [51] for the case of partially \nsynthetic data. See Jenkins, Burkhauser, Feng and Larrimore [36] for further details of our \nmultiple imputation approach to estimation and inference.23   \nThis paper performs the multiple imputation procedure only on internal March CPS \ndata, but a similar approach could be used to impute all topcoded incomes in the public use \ndata.  While, as expected, the GB2 imputation on public use data generally yields higher \nlevels of inequality than that seen using unadjusted internal data, it finds somewhat lower \nlevels of inequality than that seen from using the GB2 imputation on internal data.  This \ndifference occurs because the substantially greater information on top incomes provided by \nthe internal data improves the fit of the GB2 imputation and thus yields improved estimates \nof inequality including the top range of the income distribution.  See Jenkins, Burkhauser, \n                                                 \n23 A referee has suggested that an alternative approach to inference could be based on non-standard bootstrap \nresampling, in which bootstrap samples are drawn from the semiparametric estimate of each income distribution \n(one combining a parametric estimate of the upper tail of topcoded observations with a non-parametric estimate \nfor the rest of the distribution). A related approach is discussed by Davidson and Flachaire [24]. \n 15 \nFeng, and Larrimore [36] for a comparison of the Internal-MI estimates presented here with \nestimates derived from the same multiple imputation approach applied to public-use data \nfrom 1995\u20132004.  \n \n3. Estimates of inequality levels and trends \n \n3.1 The revised cell mean series (Public-CellMean) \nFigure 2 reports our estimates of income inequality levels and trends derived from the Public-\nCellMean and Internal-Unadjusted series that we have described so far. To highlight the \nconsequences of ignoring the additional information about top incomes that is incorporated in \nthese series, we compare them with two other series. The Public-Unadjusted series is based \non unadjusted public use data which include Census Bureau cell mean imputations for \ntopcoded observations from 1995 onwards (it is derived from the data that is available to \nresearchers in the public use files nowadays). The Public-NoCellMean series is the same as \nthe Public-Unadjusted one, except that all cell mean information is discarded. Inequality is \nsummarized using the Gini coefficient. Because public use data are topcoded, mean \nhousehold income and Gini coefficients derived from them are understated relative to those \nestimated from internal data unless cell mean imputations are used, since cell means provide \nmore information about top incomes.  \n<Figure 2 near here> \nIn every year, the Gini estimates based on the Public-NoCellMean series are below \nthose from the Internal-Unadjusted series. To correct for this difference (and for several other \nreasons), the Census Bureau revised its topcoding procedures in income year 1995. The result \nis reflected in the difference between the Gini estimates derived from the Public-NoCellMean \nand Public-Unadjusted series. Prior to 1995, the series are identical. After 1995, the Public-\n 16 \nUnadjusted Gini estimates are very similar to the Internal-Unadjusted estimates (with the \nexception of 1999), and are substantially greater than those derived from the Public-\nNoCellMean series. (We believe that the 1999 result reflects an error in the Census Bureau \ncell mean series.) Although the Gini estimates from the Public-Unadjusted series now better \nrepresent the Gini estimates derived from the Internal-Unadjusted data, anyone uncritically \nusing Gini values from the Public-Unadjusted data to describe changes in income inequality \nin the United States would greatly exaggerate its increase in 1995. \n Our Public-CellMean series corrects this problem. Figure 2 shows that the Gini \nestimates derived from these data match those derived from the Internal-Unadjusted data in \nall years including 1999. Thus the addition of our cell mean imputations to the CPS public \nuse data allows researchers without access to the Internal-Unadjusted data to produce \nvirtually the same inequality levels and trends found in the Internal-Unadjusted data.  \n We would also draw attention to the substantial jump in inequality between 1992 and \n1993 according to the Public Cell-Mean and Internal-Unadjusted series. However, much of \nthis jump is simply due to changes in CPS data collection methods that were implemented by \nthe Census Bureau at that time. (See Ryscavage [54] and Jones and Weinberg [37].) The \nvertical dotted line between 1992 and 1993 in Figure 2 (and Figure 3 below) is included in \norder to draw attention to this \u2018structural break\u2019 in all our series. \n \n3.2 Long term trends in US income inequality  \nGiven how closely our Public-CellMean series matches the levels and trends in inequality in \nthe internal CPS data, using cell means would almost completely mitigate the problem of \ntopcoding were it not for internal censoring. To address the extent of internal censoring on \nmeasures of inequality, we now extend our analysis of long term trends by comparing \nestimates of inequality derived from the Internal-Unadjusted and the Internal-MI series over \n 17 \nthe period 1975\u20132004. We do not include the other public use series in our analysis going \nforward since each of these series are inferior to the Public-CellMean series in their ability to \ntrack inequality for the entire distribution including those with topcoded incomes. We stop at \n2004 because that is the last year of internal CPS data to which we had access. Our discussion \nis in terms of the Gini coefficient initially, but then we discuss trends in Generalized Entropy \ninequality indices.24  \n Figure 3, panel (a), depicts the trends over the period 1975\u20132004 in the Gini \ncoefficient derived from the Internal-Unadjusted and the Internal-MI series. According to the \nformer, there was a dramatic increase in inequality between 1975 and 1992, with an \nacceleration of this increase starting in 1980. There was then a substantial jump in inequality \nbetween 1992 and 1993 due to changes in CPS data collection methods (see above). From \n1993 onwards, while inequality continued to rise, the rate of increase is considerably slower \nthan for the pre-1993 period.  \nSince the Internal-MI series captures the very highest incomes, it leads to higher \nmeasured inequality levels than the Internal-Unadjusted counterpart in all years. But the \ntrends in inequality represented by the series are similar. So, even though the Internal-\nUnadjusted series underestimates the level of inequality in any given year, it is accurately \ncapturing the inequality trends.  \nThe Gini coefficient rose between 1992 and 1993 more sharply for the Internal-MI \nseries than for the Internal-Unadjusted ones. This is additional evidence that the 1993 jump in \ninequality is primarily due to other survey design changes rather than to problems related to \ncensoring. That the jump is larger for the Internal-MI series also indicates that the survey-\ndesign changes may be disproportionately impacting the reporting of incomes at the top of \n                                                 \n24 For a discussion of robustness of inequality results to alternate inequality indices, see Jenkins et al. [36] which \ntracks recent trends in Lorenz curves for the US income distribution.  For a comparison of inequality trends \nusing Gini coefficients to those based on the income share of the top percentiles of the distribution, see \nBurkhauser et al. [18].   \n 18 \nthe distribution. Such an observation is consistent with the fact that the increase in inequality \nbetween 1992 and 1993 using public use CPS data \u2013 in which the topcodes are lower \u2013 do not \nshow similar increases between those two years (see Figure 2). \n \n3.3 Do conclusions differ if different measures of inequality are used? \nThe Gini coefficient is just one of many commonly-used indices of inequality. It incorporates \nparticular assumptions about how income differences are aggregated at different parts of the \nincome distribution: it is relatively sensitive to income differences in the middle of the \ndistribution (\u2018middle sensitive\u2019). This raises the question of whether alternative inequality \nmeasures, ones incorporating different aggregation assumptions, might lead to different \nconclusions about inequality trends, depending, for example, on whether changes in \ndispersion occur mainly at the top or the bottom of the distribution. We explore the sensitivity \nof our results to the choice of inequality measure by repeating our analysis using three indices \nfrom the Generalized Entropy parametric family.25 We employ the three most commonly \nused Generalized Entropy (GE) measures: I(0), the mean logarithmic deviation (MLD), \nwhich is a relatively bottom-sensitive index; I(1), the Theil index, which is relatively middle-\nsensitive; and I(2), half the squared coefficient of variation, which is an index that is top-\nsensitive.  \nWe calculated each of these GE indices using the Internal-Unadjusted and Internal-MI \nseries, and graph the estimates in Figures 3, panels (b), (c) and (d) for I(0), I(1) and I(2) \nrespectively.26 In Table 1 we provide the average annual percentage change in inequality, by \nsubperiod, for each of these inequality indices as well as the Gini coefficient, using both our \ndata series. Since the trends in inequality are markedly different in the periods before and \n                                                 \n25 See e.g. Cowell [22] or Jenkins and Van Kerm [35] for detailed discussion of these indices. \n26 Trends in the GE indices using the Public-CellMean and Public-Unadjusted data are available in the extended \nworking-paper version of this article (Burkhauser et al. [17]) \n 19 \nafter 1980 and 1993, we divide the table into four sub-periods: 1975\u20131980, 1980\u20131992, \n1992\u20131993, and 1993\u20132004.  \n<Table 1 near here> \nIn all cases, measured inequality in a given year is greatest using the Internal-MI \nseries, indicating that the Internal-Unadjusted series understate the true level of inequality. \nAdditionally, for each index (with the exception of I(2) perhaps), the trends in inequality \nusing both our data series are quite similar. However, there are differences in the observed \ntrends in inequality depending on which inequality index is chosen. \nThe results for I(0) clearly differ from those based on the Gini coefficient: compare \npanels (a) and (b) of Figure 3. First, with I(0), the difference in inequality levels between the \ntwo data series is smaller than the corresponding difference for the Gini (panel a). This is \nunsurprising because I(0) is a relatively bottom-sensitive index, and the differences between \nthese two different data series arise at the top of the distribution. Additionally, there was a \nmarked inequality growth pause in the middle of the 1980s. Since I(0) is a bottom-sensitive \ninequality measure, this suggests that the most substantial changes in the income distribution \nwere occurring towards the top of the distribution rather than towards the bottom during this \nperiod in the 1980s. Additionally, I(0) showed less signs of slowing down in the 1990s than \nour other series, suggesting that the slowdown in inequality in the 1990s was driven by \nchanges near the top of the distribution.  \nInequality trends according to the I(1) index are similar to those using the Gini \ncoefficient: compare panels (c) and (a) in Figure 3. For both series, I(1) shows a rapid \nincrease in inequality from 1980 through 1992, with a slower increase in inequality starting in \n1993.  \nAccording to I(2), the difference between the Internal-MI and Internal-Unadjusted \nseries is greater during the post-1993 period than for the other three indices: compare panel (d) \n 20 \nwith the other panels in Figure 3. Since the I(2) is a top-sensitive inequality index, these \npatterns simply reflect the fact that topcoding mainly affects incomes near the top of the \ndistribution. However, the I(2) estimates also exhibit greater year-on-year variability in the \npost-1993 period than do the other three indices. These results may arise because I(2) \nestimates tend to have larger sampling variability relative to these other indices, other things \nbeing equal.27 Thus, more caution is warranted when discussing inequality trends using this \nindex.  \n \n4. Conclusions \nWe analyze trends in income inequality in the USA over three decades (1975\u20132004), drawing \non internal CPS data that are not generally available to researchers outside the Census Bureau. \nAlthough the CPS is the most authoritative survey data source for studying US income \ninequality, the topcoding of each of its many sources of income artificially lowers the level of \ninequality and potentially affects estimates of inequality trends, whether one uses public or \ninternal CPS data. This has necessitated that researchers interested in trends in income \ninequality either use CPS data and focus only on inequality in lower portions of the \ndistribution, or use other data sources such as IRS administrative records that allow one to \ncapture inequality trends near the top of the distribution but not to observe trends at lower \nincomes.  \nWe consider several methods for addressing censoring and, as a byproduct of this \nwork, derive a revised cell mean imputation series that can be applied to public use data. This \nseries allows researchers to more accurately capture levels and trends in the internal data. In \naddition, we take account of censoring in the internal data using a multiple imputation \n                                                 \n27 I(2) is also relatively prone to non-robustness to the effects of outliers in the sense discussed by Cowell and \nVictoria-Feser [23]. However, we would stress the role of sampling variability, since the \u2018averaging\u2019 process \nused to combine the estimates from our 100 multiply imputed data sets is likely to smooth out the effects of any \noutliers being added by the imputation process. \n 21 \napproach that uses parametric methods to derive imputations for topcoded incomes and \nallows us to observe inequality trends for the entire US income distribution.  \nWhen the Gini coefficient is used to measure inequality, we find the level of income \ninequality according to our Internal-MI series is slightly higher in corresponding years than \ninequality according to the Internal-Unadjusted series before 1993 and significantly higher \nafter 1993. But despite this difference in levels, the trends in inequality we find using the two \nseries are not significantly different. Inequality rose over the whole period 1975\u20132004, but \nthe rate of increase slowed after 1993.  \nThe story about trends differs when we use the three Generalized Entropy inequality \nindices, but the differences in trends are readily explicable in terms of the properties of the \nindices, specifically their differences in sensitivity to income differences in different ranges \nof the income distribution. I(0) rose steadily during 1975\u20132004 (apart from a pause during the \nmid-1980s), showing no sign of slowing down after 1993. But our I(1) and I(2) series are \nsimilar to our Gini series in their trends, subject to the caveat that I(2) indices are less \nprecisely estimated and show larger year-on-year variation. Because I(0) is more bottom-\nsensitive than the other inequality measures, our results suggest that what is happening in the \nupper part of the income distribution is responsible for the 1990s slowdown in rate of \ninequality increase.  \nOur results for household income are largely consistent with other research that has \nused public use CPS data to examine levels and trends in wage inequality (e.g. Autor, Katz \nand Kearney [8]) or income inequality for lower portions of the income distribution (e.g. \nGottschalk and Danziger [33]) but differ from the results for income inequality found by \nPiketty and Saez [49] using IRS administrative record data. The differences between our \nresults and those of Piketty and Saez may be partially due to differences in the income units \n(since Piketty and Saez consider distributions of income among tax units while we explore \n 22 \nhousehold income among individuals), as well as differences in the types of income reported \nin the two datasets. A valuable avenue for future research would be to explore the differences \nbetween the IRS and CPS datasets to more fully understand the differences in these results, as \nwe have begun to do in our current research (see Burkhauser et al. [18]). \n 23 \nAcknowledgements:  \n \nThe research in this paper was conducted while Burkhauser, Feng and Larrimore were \nSpecial Sworn Status researchers of the U.S. Census Bureau at the New York Census \nResearch Data Center at Cornell University.
