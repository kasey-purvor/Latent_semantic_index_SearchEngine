We clarify the nature of this link by \nexamining the impact of concurrent requirements for random sequence response \nquality. Experiments 1A and 1B show that marking specific response choices for \ndifferential treatment, either by requiring an ancillary behaviour or by suppressing \nthese choices from output, impairs overall sequence quality. Contrasting with \nprevious findings, these distinct concurrent tasks have comparable effects. We show \nthat disruption is found only when concurrent demand is high. Experiment 2 \ndemonstrates that increasing the dynamic working memory load by requiring the \nancillary response to change during the task leads to additional disruption of \nrandomisation. The results extend and refine our understanding of the contribution of \nactive maintenance of representations in random generation.\n 4 \nIntroduction \n \nFrom time to time, cognitive psychologists ask their experimental participants to \nproduce sequences of random numbers under substantial time pressure. Invariably, \nthe participants struggle with the task, even in relatively benign study configurations. \nWhile randomisers understand their task in general, its execution is problematic. That \nis, although participants may labour under some misunderstandings about randomness \n(e.g. Bar-Hillel & Wagenaar, 1991), they often recognise the inadequacy of their own \nresponse choices, implicating production constraints.  \n \nYet, we should probably not be overly surprised at this task difficulty. It is worth \nbearing in mind how difficult it is for researchers to capture randomness in a single, \ncomprehensive measure, though one can certainly assess many facets of performance \n(e.g., Ginsburg & Karpiuk, 1991; Towse & Neil, 1998). So pity the poor participants \nwho must submit their response sequence to such varied scrutiny! Also, mental \nprocesses are more commonly deployed in the service of pattern detection and \nenvironmental prediction (e.g. Kareev, 1995). Therefore, producing behaviour that \nlacks the qualities that otherwise are almost ubiquitous, goes against the grain. \n \nExperimental research into random generation has suggested that response production \nin adults (and children) relies on \u201cExecutive Functions\u201d (EFs) (Baddeley, 1986; \nBaddeley, Emslie, Kolodny & Duncan, 1998; Miyake et al., 2000; Towse & \nMclachlan, 1999; Vandierendonck, 2000). Whilst EFs represent a loosely defined \ncognitive construct, random generation illustrates the engagement of different higher-\norder mental operations that modulate other processes. More specifically, in \n 5 \ngenerating random numbers there are natural, over-learned sequences or response \nchains (e.g. \u201c1, 2, 3\u201d) and rate-limited, inhibitory processes (possibly involving \ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Knoch, Brugger & Regard, 2005) act to minimise their \noccurrence. Randomisers also need to consider all response alternatives and \nperformance declines as the response set size increases (Towse, 1998). This is \nconsistent with the notion of an additional limited capacity activation function that \ntries to maintain representations of responses so that they are available for selection. \n \nDespite a generic consensus that random generation involve EFs (see Brugger, 1997), \nresearch has been \u201csporadic\u201d (Heuer, Kohlisch, & Klein, 2005). Thus, it is important \nto focus on the nature of the executive requirements in randomisation and we \nconcentrate here on the particular role of working memory \u2013 i.e. the maintenance and \ntransformation of transient representations (Baddeley. 1986; 2000). \n \nTo investigate working memory constraints on randomisation, Towse and Valentine \n(1997, Expt. 2) described a paradigm that imposed additional requirements. \nParticipants either suppressed particular response values (e.g., randomising numbers \nbetween 1 and 12 but avoiding 4 and 8 as responses) or performed an ancillary \nmemory task (e.g., randomising numbers between 1 and 10 but tapping the desk on \nproduction of 4 and 8 to demonstrate memory for these \u2018marked\u2019 values). Insofar as \none must remember an item\u2019s special status in order to withhold it from output, the \nremember condition formed a useful control for measuring active inhibition itself. \n \nTowse and Valentine (1997) found that sequence randomness declined with both \nconcurrent requirements, measured in terms of digram combinations and the \n 6 \noccurrence of rising or falling ordinal sequences. They also reported more adjacent \nresponses were produced in the suppression condition than the remember condition \nand there were more counting sequences (e.g., \u201c3, 4\u201d or \u201c9, 8\u201d). One interpretation \nwas that the executive requirement to suppress response values - over and above the \nneed to remember them - degraded the control over response production. \nConsequently, output included more prepotent responses. \n \nThe findings raise several additional issues. For example, they do not address whether \nany concurrent task requirement (suppression or memory) produces the observed \npattern, or alternatively, whether the size of the concurrent load is critical. Towse and \nValentine (1997) marked either two out of ten responses for differential treatment, or \nnone. Consequently, the observed effect could arise from the additional task \nrequirement itself, or it could be load-dependent. This question relates to the theories \nof random generation and cognitive control. For example, the need to represent and \nmaintain additional task goals (Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996) \nmight constrain the ability to implement the primary task objective of randomisation. \nAlternatively, both primary and concurrent requirements might rely on working \nmemory operations, yet impairment may occur only when capacity is sufficiently \nchallenged. This latter type of approach suggests that performance is dependent on \nnot just the presence but also the extent of the concurrent task requirements. In \ngeneral, this view would be compatible with \u2018load theory\u2019 (Lavie, Hirst, De Fockert & \nViding, 2004) whereby large cognitive control requirements enhance the effect of \ndistractors. Of course, these two accounts need not be exclusive, and they are \nexamined below. \n \n 7 \nExperiment 1A \n \nThis study explores and extends previous findings of a disruptive effect on random \ngeneration from remember and suppress requirements, as well as the overproduction \nof adjacent values with suppression. We varied the concurrent task load to specify its \nsource; marking a single item and two items for differential treatment, as well as \nusing a control condition. The sample size matched Towse and Valentine (1997) and \nparticipants produced 81 responses from among 9 alternatives. This response \nsequence density, relative to response choice, is comparable with other test protocols. \n \nParticipants \n \nTwenty-four na\u00efve adult participants registered through a research notice-board. They \nwere paid a \u00a32 honorarium for a 15-minute experimental session. Twelve participants \nwere assigned at random to the remember and twelve to the suppression conditions. \n \nProcedure \n \nParticipants initially read a set of standard instructions (see Appendix 1). These \nrequested a random number sequence at a regular speed (1 item every 1.5 seconds) \ncued by an auditory signal, a tone, from a cassette tape. The experimenter identified \nthe set of 9 response alternatives. Participants in either condition provided 3 random \nnumber sequences; with no concurrent task (control), with one number and with two \nnumbers marked for differential treatment. In the remember condition, participants \ntapped the desk in front of them when they produced a marked value. They were \n 8 \nasked that the ancillary task not influence their random responses (they should not \nproduce the number(s) more or less often than they otherwise would). In the \nsuppression condition, participants attempted to avoid saying marked response \nvalue(s) (e.g., use the numbers 1 to 10 but avoid 4, or 1 to 11 but avoid 3 and 7). \nMarked number values varied across participants and sequences, they were never the \nlargest or smallest response choice, and in the case of the two-item condition, the \nnumber values were different sides of the median. Each production sequence \ncomprised 81 responses. The order of tasks, either control to one-item to two-item \nconditions or vice versa, was counterbalanced. \n \nResults \n \nResponse compliance \nBefore examining the quality of random sequences, we report on two forms of \nresponse failures. The first was a failure to maintain the response pace (see Table 1). \nAnalysis of variance showed a trend for an increased number of missed responses \nwith a concurrent task, F(1.3,28.6) = 3.51, p<.07, \u03b7p2=.1381. Suppression led to more \nmissed responses than the memory requirements, but not significantly so, F(1,22) = \n2.64, \u03b7p2=.107. However, four participants missed approximately 20% of response \ncues in at least one condition. Their response rate was considerably slower than that \nspecified in the experimental design. \n \n                                                \n1 In cases where ANOVA sphericity assumptions were violated, Greenhouse-Geisser \ncorrections were applied to the degrees of freedom, and these values are reported in \nthe text. \n 9 \nA second error type concerns response violations; the production of a value outside \nthe permitted range (e.g., the number 10 when randomising between 1 and 9), a \nprohibited response in the suppression condition, or a marked value response without \nan accompanying memory signal in the remember condition. Analysis of variance \nconfirmed that more violations occurred when there were concurrent requirements, \nF(2,34.0) =10.01, p<.01, \u03b7p2=.313, more violations under suppression instructions, \nF(1,22) = 5.28, p<.05, \u03b7p2=.194, and an interaction between these factors, F(2,34.0) = \n4.19, p<.05, \u03b7p2=.160. The increase in response violations across load was more \nmarked in the suppression condition than the remember condition.  \n \nTable 1 about here. \n \nResponse quality \nRandomness is unusual because it concerns the absence of any structural feature. \nRandomness indices generally assess the extent to which responses are non-random. \nThey actually measure the orderliness or regularity (see also Reed & Johnson, 1994 \nfor a perspective from the sequence learning literature on response structure). \nHowever, regularity may occur in myriad different forms, and lack of response \nstructure in one respect may be independent of another. From analysis of different \nindices, Towse & Neil (1998) offered evidence that there were potentially at least four \npsychological factors in randomisation. We therefore sample from (and only from) \nmeasures representative of these factors, explained in more detail below and in \nAppendix 2; We employed three measures of stereotyped sequences (Turning Point \nIndex (TPI), Random Number Generation (RNG), & Adjacency (A)); one measure of \nthe tendency to draw upon all responses evenly (Redundancy (R)); and short-term and \n 10 \nlong-term repetition avoidance (Phi2 & Phi7 respectively). Of principal interest, given \nprevious results, are measures of sequence stereotypy; others are reported for \ncompleteness. \n \nTPI scores measure stereotyped behaviour by assessing changes between ascending \nand descending runs of numbers. Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of \ntask load, F(2,44) = 6.41, p<.01, \u03b7p2=.226, mainly attributable to greater non-random \nbias on the two-item condition. This differed from the control and one-item condition, \n(t(23)=3.11, p<.01, d=.634, & t(23)=2.87, p<.01, d=.585 respectively) but the one-\nitem condition did not differ from control, t(23)=.032, d=.006. There was no \nsignificant difference between suppression and remember conditions, F<1, \u03b7p2=.005, \nand no interaction, F<1, \u03b7p2=.019. As explained in Appendix 2, RNG scores assess \nthe reliance on repeating response pairs. Analysis suggested no significant effect of \ntask load, F(2,44) = 2.24, \u03b7p2=.092, or difference between concurrent conditions, F<1, \n\u03b7p\n2=.001, or an interaction, F(2,44) = 2.18, \u03b7p2=.090. \n \nR scores assess the degree to which response alternatives are chosen equally. R varied \nmarginally with task load, F(1.4, 30.4) = 3.08, p<.08, \u03b7p2=.123 (compared with \ncontrol performance, R scores increased with a one-item load but decreased with a \ntwo-item load). There was no significant difference between remember and \nsuppression conditions, F<1, \u03b7p2=.037, nor an interaction, F(1.4,30.4)=1.15, \u03b7p2=.049. \nPhi2 scores essentially measure response repetition. These are often infrequent in \nhuman random sequences, as can be seen with first-order differences in Figure 1, \nwhere \u20180\u2019 indicates immediate repetitions (Brugger, Monsch, Salmon, & Butters, \n1996). Phi2 scores did not vary significantly with task load, F<1, \u03b7p2=.032, or task \n 11 \ntype, F(1,22) = 2.11, \u03b7p2=.088, and these factors did not interact, F<1, \u03b7p2=.031. Phi-7 \nscores reflect repetitions across (five) intervening items. These values were also \ninvariant across experimental condition, with no significant effect of task load, F<1, \n\u03b7p\n2=.036, task type, F<1, \u03b7p2=.01, or interaction, F<1, \u03b7p2=.011. \n \nFigure 1 about here. \n \nTowse and Valentine (1997) reported that two-item suppression, relative to remember \ndemands, specifically increased A scores (a response value adjacent to its \npredecessor, i.e., \u20181\u2019 and \u2018-1\u2019 in Figure 1). Analysis of A scores indicated a significant \ndifference between task load conditions, F(1.4,30.6) = 7.68, p<.01, \u03b7p2=.259, but no \ndifference between remember and suppress requirements, F<1, \u03b7p2=.029 and no \ninteraction, F<1, \u03b7p2=.006. The effect of task load is attributable to the two-item \ncondition: this differed from the one-item and control conditions (t(23)=3.19, p<.01, \nd=.651, and t(23)=2.77, p<.05, d=.565 respectively), while the one-item did not differ \nfrom control condition, t(23)=.81, d=.165. \n \nCondition completion order was an incidental variable. Nonetheless we report its \neffect on randomisation quality. Analysis indicated only that participants produced \nlower A scores (adjacent responses) on all sequences when the control condition was \nattempted first. We take this to suggest that the control condition offered a beneficial \nintroduction to the task, which then persisted.  \n \nIndependence of task components \n 12 \nAlthough instructions asked participants to ignore concurrent task requirements in \nterms of random response choices, one can ask nonetheless whether flagging a \nparticular response option as \u2018special\u2019 makes its selection more or less alluring. The \nresponse frequency of the single remember item (M=12.1, SD=3.78) differed from the \noverall average (9 items per choice), t(11) = 2.83, p<.05, d=.817. The (average) \nresponse frequency of the two remember items (M=9.42, SD=1.48) was not \nsignificantly greater than overall mean, t(11) = 1.13, d=.326. In the suppression \ncondition, a somewhat analogous question is whether the prohibition on particular \nresponses leads to the over-selection of neighbouring values, as participants hover \naround the illicit choices. Although responses to randomly selected neighbouring \nvalues were higher than the overall mean (M=9.17, SD=1.35 and M=9.29, SD=1.76, \nin the single and two-item condition), these effects were not significant (t(11) = .43, \nd=.124, and t(11) =.57, d=.165, respectively). Finally, the production frequency of \nthose single response values that had been marked as different for the preceding \nsequence did not differ from global average frequencies for either the remember or \nsuppress conditions. Thus, there was no evidence for \u2018proactive interference\u2019 from \none condition to another. \n \nExperiment 1B \n \nIn Experiment 1A several participants did not adhere to the pacing requirements. \nSome individuals may have achieved response suppression only by generating no \nresponse at all, masking task difficulty. Therefore, in Experiment 1B, extra effort was \ndevoted to explaining the importance of the response pace. Revised instructions \nemphasised and reminded participants of the timing cues. We used 100 responses per \n 13 \ncondition from 10 choices to increase sampling density and even more closely \nreplicate Towse and Valentine (1997), once again using the same sample size to \nfacilitate comparison with that study and with Experiment 1A. \n \nParticipants and Procedure \n \nTwenty seven adult participants registered through a research notice-board. All were \nna\u00efve (one completed a separate spatial randomisation task 4 months previously) and \npaid \u00a32.  The procedure mostly followed Experiment 1A, although participants \nproduced 100 responses from the numbers 1-10. In addition to the previous \ninstructions, participants were told \u201cit\u2019s really important to try and respond within the \ntime limit. Make sure you produce one response for each tone that you hear.\u201d Later, \nthey were told \u201cI\u2019m going to write down your responses. If you slow down and don\u2019t \ngive a response in the time available, I have to mark that as a missed response. I\u2019d like \nyou to avoid missed responses as far as possible\u201d. Timekeeping instructions were re-\niterated between sequence productions. \n \nResults \n \nResponse compliance \nThree participants were dropped from analysis because more than 10% of a sequence \nincluded illegitimate or missed responses. Table 1 details adherence to instructions, \nindicating greater compliance with instructions than Experiment 1A, especially with \nrespect to timekeeping. Analysis of variance on response rate failures revealed a \nsignificant main effect of load, F(1.4,31.0)=6.25, p<.05, \u03b7p2 =.221, no reliable \n 14 \ndifference between the tasks, F(1,22)=1.44, \u03b7p2 =.061, and no interaction, \nF(1.4,31.0)=2.54, \u03b7p2 =.103. Analysis of variance on the number of response \nviolations indicated a significant load effect, F(1.2,26.4)=9.02, p<.01, \u03b7p2 =.291, more \nviolations in the suppression condition, F(1,22)=12.4, p<.01, \u03b7p2 =.360, and a \nsignificant interaction, F(1.2,26.4)=5.61, p<.05, \u03b7p2 =.203. The concurrent load effect \non response errors was more marked in the suppression than in the memory condition. \n \nResponse quality \nAnalysis of TPI scores (see Appendix 2 for details) showed no significant effect of \nload, F(1.6,34.4)=2.14, \u03b7p2 =.089, task, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.004, or interaction, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.002. \nLikewise, RNG scores did not show an effect of load, F(1.5,31.9)=2.09, \u03b7p2 =.087, \ntask, F(1,22)=3.02, p<.10, \u03b7p2 =.121, or an interaction, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.034. \n \nIndices that reflected other randomness factors did not show significant experimental \neffects; for the manipulation of load [R scores, F(2,44)=1.36, \u03b7p2 =.058, RNG scores, \nF(1.5,31.9)=2.09, \u03b7p2 =.087, Phi2 values, F(2,44)=1.47, \u03b7p2 =.063, or Phi7 values, \nF(2,44)=1.51, \u03b7p2 =.065], or task [R scores, F<1, \u03b7p2 <.001, RNG scores, \nF(1,22)=3.02, p<.10, \u03b7p2 =.121, Phi2 scores, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.023 or Phi7 scores, F<1, \u03b7p2 \n=.003]. Interaction terms were all non significant (Fs<2.03, \u03b7p2<.085).  \n \nHowever, as in Experiment 1A, the measure of adjacent values (A) revealed \nsignificantly greater response regularity with a concurrent load, F(2,44)=10.13, \np<.001, \u03b7p2 =.315. Again, there was no difference between memory and suppression \nrequirements, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.004, and no interaction, F(2,44)=1.97, \u03b7p2 =.082. Figure 2 \nillustrates this result. Pairwise comparisons again confirmed that both control and \n 15 \nsingle-item conditions differed from the two-item condition, ts(23)>3.86, p<.01, \nds>.788, while the control and single item values did not differ, t(23)=1.08, d=.220. \nAnalysis of order effects (whether the control condition was first or last) showed no \nreliable differences for any of the above randomisation indices. \n \nFigure 2 about here. \n \nWe then combined control and two-item A scores from Experiment 1A and 1B to \nproduce a sample size double that used by Towse and Valentine (1997). Analysis \nconfirmed a strong load effect, F(1,44)=18.0, p<.01, \u03b7p2 =.290, but still no difference \nbetween concurrent tasks, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.007, and no interaction, F<1, \u03b7p2 =.010. \n \nIndependence of task components \nWith both one and (the average of) two marked remember values, production \nfrequency was significantly higher than the overall mean (10), (M=14.8, SD=1.95, \nt(11)=8.6, p<.001, d=2.48 and M=13.0, SD=2.00, t(11)=5.20, p<.001, d=1.50, \nrespectively). In the single-item suppression condition, the frequency of a randomly \nselected neighbour was higher than the average response frequency of 10, (M=11.3, \nSD=1.87, t(11)=2.46, p<.05, d=.710). With two suppression items, mean production \nof neighbourhood values did not differ from the overall mean (M=10.6, SD=1.88, \nt(11)=1.15, d=.332). The production frequency of those response choices marked as \ndifferent on the preceding condition did not differ from the overall mean for either the \nremember or suppress conditions. \n \nDiscussion \n 16 \n \nThe data are valuable in at least three of respects. First, they partially replicate \nprevious research, demonstrating specific disruption to randomisation from \nconcurrent tasks. Second, they extend that work, suggesting the point at which \nconcurrent tasks interfere. Third, results also challenge aspects of the original \nfindings.  \n \nUsing a similar design and sample size to Towse and Valentine (1997), Experiment \n1A and 1B confirm that randomisation performance is affected by instructions both to \nremember and to avoid certain response values. Such effects are localised largely in \nthe production of adjacent values and the chaining of response sequences (that \nchanges occur only for certain indices simply points to the specific nature of \ndisruption). \n \nTowse and Valentine (1997) compared a control condition with no concurrent \nrequirement to a condition in which two items were identified for special treatment \n(associated with a remember or suppression action). The present studies extended this \ndesign by incorporating a further condition in which just one item was singled out for \nspecial treatment. The results show that the one item concurrent load was largely \nequivalent to the control condition, while both differed from the two-item concurrent \nload. Although one might treat the lack of difference between the control and single-\nitem conditions cautiously, the two-item condition is statistically distinct from the \nothers. The data imply that a concurrent task per se is less critical to performance than \nthe exact load of that task. Such a conclusion resonates with, for example, seminal \n 17 \nworking memory studies reporting impairment on a reasoning task by an additional 6-\nitem memory load but not a 2-item load (Hitch & Baddeley, 1976). \n \nIn contrast to the previous reports, we found an equivalent disruption effect from each \nconcurrent task, for both Experiment 1A and 1B which had the same sample size as \nprevious analysis, as well as when these datasets were combined together. Thus, the \nimpact of the concurrent requirements does not appear to be task specific, as initially \nargued (Towse & Valentine, 1997) but instead arises from being functionally \ndistracted from randomisation. We conclude that there is less reason to argue that \nacting upon a representation (by suppressing its production) has noticeable effects \nbeyond the maintenance of representations themselves during randomisation. That is \nnot to say that the concurrent tasks are the same \u2013 there are differences in the \nopportunities for and occurrences of response compliance failures for example \u2013 but \nwe do not find consistent differences here in randomisation production. \n \nInspection of First Order Differences (FOD) gives a possible clue as to the difference \nbetween the present findings and previous reports. In both current datasets, two-item \nsuppression produces an increase in \u201c-1\u201d and \u201c1\u201d FOD values (albeit in Experiment \n1B more symmetrical). This matches Towse and Valentine (1997). However, the \nremember instructions also lead to \u201c-1\u201d and \u201c1\u201d increases here, but had very little \nimpact in Towse and Valentine (1997). That is, the suppression effect is actually \nhighly consistent across all three analyses, but the effect of remember requirements \nwas smaller in the original study than has been obtained here. Previous results appear \nto have underestimated the impact of concurrent memory operations. This is \ninvestigated further in the next experiment. \n 18 \n \nExperiment 2 \n \nExperiment 1 establishes that randomisation is affected by a substantive concurrent \ntask contingent upon primary task response choices. The effect is robust, although \nlargely localised to measures of sequence stereotypy. In other words, when \nparticipants are required to accompany some of their random responses with another \nbehaviour (i.e., tapping a desk when certain responses are produced), the quality of \nrandom generation declines. However, in the data reported so far, the memory items \nare constant through the task - it is always the same one or two items that require an \nidentical motoric response. Experiment 2 investigated whether a dynamic concurrent \nrequirement \u2013 one in which the response changed through the task and thereby \nimposed greater working memory requirements, would produce more disruption. \n \nTo produce a dynamic concurrent task, participants engaged in a sequence of response \nmovements around the perimeter of a laminated A4 board. There were 8 locations in a \nrectangular outline. Participants made a series of hand taps, with the target location \nmoving in a clockwise direction following each marked response. For example, if the \nnumbers \u201c2\u201d and \u201c7\u201d were marked for tapping, when the participant chose \u201c2\u201d as a \nrandom response, they tapped the bottom left location. On the next production of \u201c2\u201d \nthey tapped the middle left location. If they then selected \u201c7\u201d for the first time, they \ntapped the bottom left location, and so on. Participants therefore needed to maintain \nand update a memory representation of the tap location for the two marked numbers. \n \n 19 \nOn the assumption that working memory representations are utilised in random \ngeneration performance, we predicted that the dynamic location tracking requirements \nwould impair randomisation to a greater extent than the constant remember \nrequirements, even though the latter induces a noticeable decline in performance \nrelative to control conditions. Since we focus on the relative impact of the dynamic \nvs. static memory requirement, a control condition was not employed here. \n \nParticipants \n \nSeventeen na\u00efve adult participants registered through a research notice board. They \nwere paid a \u00a32 honorarium for a 15-minute experimental session.  \n \nProcedure \n \nThe random generation task was explained as before, emphasising timekeeping (see \nExperiment 1B). Participants produced two sequences \u2013 with remember or track \ninstructions  \u2013 in counterbalanced order. They were asked to make randomisation \nchoices without reference to the concurrent task (i.e. not to use marked responses \ndifferently from others) and produced a sequence of 100 single digit numbers. \nRemember instructions. The experimenter identified two response choices (values \nvaried across individuals). Participants tapped the desk in front of them whenever \nthey chose either number as part of their random sequence. \nTrack instructions. The experimenter identified two response choices (these also \nvaried across individuals and were always different from those used in the remember \ncondition). Participants tapped the appropriate location (marked on a laminated sheet \n 20 \nin front of them) whenever they chose either number as part of their random \nsequence. They started at the bottom left position, advancing locations in a clockwise \ndirection, tapping boxes in a separate sequence for each of the two numbers. \n \nResults \n \nOne participant was excluded from analysis after failing to follow task instructions \nwith respect to timekeeping and concurrent tasks.  We then calculated the average \nnumber of response rate failures and rule violations (a response choice outside the \npermitted range or a failure to tap for a marked response). We also noted separately \nthe number of tracking errors for both marked values: occasions when a participant \nfailed to select the correct spatial location. As Table 2 shows, compliance with \nrandomisation requests was good, and the trend for fewer response rate and response \nviolation errors in the tracking condition was not significant, t(15)=1.96, p<.10, d=.49 \nand t(15)=1.35, d=.338. Table 2 shows that participants clearly had problems tracking \nthe appropriate position to tap when they produced one of the marked response \nchoices, with participants both repeating and skipping locations. This is suggestive of \na possible, albeit weak trade-off, with randomisation compliance in the tracking \ncondition occurring at the expense of tracking accuracy. \n \nTable 2 and Figure 3 about here.  \n \nAnalysis of randomisation revealed performance was significantly poorer in the \ntracking compared with the remember condition as measured by the RNG index, \nt(15)=3.02, p<.01, d=.755, and by the A index, t(15)=4.72, p<.001, d=1.18, see Figure \n 21 \n3. TPI scores were marginally less random in the track compared with the remember \ncondition, t(15)=1.97, p<.10, d=.493. Other dimensions of randomisation quality were \nnot affected; task differences were not significant as measured by R scores, \nt(15)=1.64, d=.41, Phi2 scores, t(15)=.91, d=.228, or Phi7 scores, t(23)=1.66, d=.415. \nIn summary, the requirement to track locations for two numbers, in comparison to \nmaking a hand tap, led participants to produce more adjacent response choices and \ndigram pairs (as well as a trend for longer runs of successively increasing or \ndecreasing sequences).  \n \nComparison of randomisation scores according to task order (which was \ncounterbalanced) produced two significant effects. When participants completed the \nstatic remember condition first, their Phi7 scores were less biased and their TPI scores \nwere more biased specifically in the remember condition. \n \nWe next examined whether the marked values were differentially selected. With two \nmarked remember values, participants preferentially chose those items in \nrandomisation (M=11.7, SD=1.77), t(15)=3.75, p<.01, d=.938. This preference was \nalso evident in the track condition (M=12.6, SD=1.42), t(15)=7.20, p<.001, d=1.8. \n \nDiscussion \n \nExperiments 1A and 1B established that there is a disruptive effect on random number \ngeneration from remembering that two of the numbers are different, insofar as they \nelicit a hand tap when they are chosen. We assume that this concurrent task involves \nworking memory, because participants must keep the two marked numbers in a raised \n 22 \nstate of activation. Indeed, there is evidence to support this insofar as the marked \nnumbers are preferentially chosen as random responses. \n \nThe current experiment shows that increasing the working memory demands of the \nconcurrent task, not by changing the marked values but instead the consequent \nactions, has a further disruptive effect on random generation. When participants need \nto represent and update target positions for their hand tap, random generation suffers. \nThey produced more stereotyped response sequences, in terms of adjacent numbers \nand other paired combinations. The concurrent task itself was hard, and participants\u2019 \nmade mistakes in selecting a location (returning to a previous position or omitting a \nposition from the sequence). Thus, relative to the remember condition, both primary \nand concurrent task performance declined. The data support the contention that in \nselecting random numbers, participants draw upon working memory to represent and \nupdate task-relevant information, such that access to these representations can be \nusurped by the memory demands of the concurrent task. For example, participants \nmight normally utilise information about selection history (i.e., which numbers and \nsequences have already been produced) to modulate current choices (see also Tune, \n1964), but the tracking task degrades this process. \n \nGeneral Discussion \n \nAcross several datasets, random generation has been shown to be a highly demanding \ncognitive task that is very difficult to perform well. Interference occurs with \nadditional requirements, provided these are sufficiently taxing. That is, distraction \nitself is not necessarily disruptive, but it can be if demands are sufficient. This finding \n 23 \nhas potential implications for the interpretation of random generation as an \ninterference task. Performance does not change linearly with load; a simple task may \nbe qualitatively different from a more complex one. It is also concluded that random \ngeneration draws on working memory. We have demonstrated that concurrent \nmemory requirements, especially when these change, hamper sequence selection.  \n \nResults confirm one specific conclusion from Towse and Valentine (1997) that asking \nparticipants to suppress response values impairs the quality of random sequences. Yet \nthey also indicate, contrary to previous conclusions, that marking response choices \nout for special treatment can produce an equivalent impairment. The dynamic \nmemory requirements of random generation are underlined by the further effect \nobtained when participants need to remember and update spatial position information \nduring the task. The results suggest that the impact of suppression requirements lie \nsubstantially with the need to keep in mind the particular inhibitory requirement (see \nWegner, 1994), rather than the act of suppression per se. \n \nThe evidence from Experiment 2 supports findings that other random sequencing \ntasks, such as random interval generation impair both verbal short-term memory (e.g., \nVandierendonck, De Vooght & Van der Goten, 1998) and spatial memory (e.g., \nVandierendonck, Kemps, Fastame, & Szmalec, 2004). The present data extends these \nanalyses by showing the converse result \u2013a memory requirement (in this case with a \nspatial component) that affects randomisation. Thus, they all point to a functional \noverlap between memory and randomisation processes (see also Baddeley et al., \n1998). \n \n 24 \nSuch findings advance the case for regarding working memory as broadly relevant to \nrandom generation, but also demonstrate more specifically that memory processes are \nintegral to executive task performance. This is especially true for memory \nrepresentations that change, and thus require continuous updating and the inhibition \nof no-longer-relevant representations (e.g., Hasher, Lustig & Zacks, in press; \nPalladino, Cornoldi, De Beni & Pazzaglia, 2001), even though Experiment 1 shows \nthat changing memory representations in the concurrent task are not necessary for \nrandomisation to be disrupted. We suggest that response selection in randomisation \nincorporates both immediate and more distant past choices, and consideration of the \npreceding sequence can be regarded as a working memory function (see also Kareev, \n1995). More generally, the findings are broadly compatible with (and link to) load \ntheory, which argues that increases in working memory demand produce greater \ndistraction effects (Lavie et al., 2004). In the context of the present results, it is the \nextent of the load and not its precise form (i.e., the requirement to remember or \nsuppress) that is most relevant, and which produces non-linear effects. \n \nWhile the experiments have demonstrated the particular impact of concurrent tasks, \nwe do not claim to have employed, in the strict sense, a dual task approach. Although \nthe remember instruction plainly produces a separate response, it is linked because it \nis contingent on particular randomisation behaviour. The tasks are therefore loosely \nrelated, and the additional activity completed intermittently. In a prototypical dual \ntask situation, two separate tasks are formally independent, even though they may \nproduce cross-talk (e.g., Baddeley et al., 1998; Vandierendonck et al., 2004). The \nbroad compatibility in the results, despite differences in the exact nature of the \nconcurrent task, reinforce the generality of the present conclusions. \n 25 \n \nThe case for linking random generation paradigms to the working memory \nframework, in particular the concept of a central executive, was persuasively made by \nBaddeley (1986), by reviewing the then-extant data (e.g., Baddeley, 1966). While \nlegitimate concerns can be expressed about exactly how to characterise this \nrelationship, because for example EFs are heterogeneous (Miyake et al., 2000) and \nrandom generation itself is multiply determined (Towse, 1998; Towse & Houston-\nPrice, 2001), the present data demonstrate how each concept has something to offer \nthe other. The concept of working memory, especially the emphasis on active \nmaintenance of representations, clearly helps to provide a general explanatory cloak \nby which to understand randomisation. At the same time, the need in random \ngeneration to maintain representations of legitimate responses as well as integrate \nprevious with current choices, exemplifies the subtle functions of working memory.  \n \nInhibition is very important in randomisation, yet requires modulation via working \nmemory of active representations that extend in time. Inhibition, as part of selection \nfrom among competing response candidates, involves the assertion of control over \nrepresentations in a way that may correspond to dynamic memory tracking or \nupdating. Thus, the current data support the more generic contention that the active \nmaintenance and transformation of information is closely tied into executive \nfunctioning. So while the random generation task has been characterised as a \u201cblunt \ninstrument whose detailed theoretical interpretation is at best equivocal\u201d (Baddeley et \nal., 1998, p.849), such a cautionary approach can be complemented by the present \npositive view of what may be achieved, with the current paradigms offering an insight \ninto the interface between memory and cognition. \n 26 \nReferences \n \nBaddeley, A.

To give you an idea of what the task requires, imagine you roll a fair \ndie. Each side of the die is equally likely to be selected with every roll, and each roll \nis independent of the preceding ones. I would like you to attempt to produce a set of \nnumbers as if you were simulating a fair die.   \n \nYour sequences will be recorded and analysed to measure how close you were to \nsimulating a random sequence of numbers. For example, if you produce more \nadjacent number responses (for example \u20182-3\u2019, \u20187-6) than would occur from a random \nsource these patterns will be noted as being non-random. If you choose particular \nnumbers too often or not often enough, this will also be detected. Often sequences are \nnon random in that choices are do not repeat often enough (i.e. people don\u2019t say the \nsame number twice in succession often enough, or the repeat the number with just a \nsingle intervening item, etc.). Thus, the point is to try and make the sequence of \nnumbers as unpredictable or as jumbled up as possible. \n \nYou will hear a series of tones at the rate of 1 per 1.5 seconds.  Please produce a \nnumber each time you hear the computer give a signal, and continue until told to stop \n(this will be after 81 responses). \n \nThe most important part of the task is to keep pace with the tones, to give a number at \nthe right time.  Remember, there is no \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 answer to give, so there is no \nneed to be anxious. Just try to produce a random sequence of numbers as best you \ncan. \n 31 \nAppendix 2 \nExplanations of randomisation indices (for a more extensive treatment, see Ginsburg \n& Karpiuk, 1994; Towse & Neil, 1998). \n \nRNG \u2013 An assessment of the distribution of all response pairs in the sequence. Values \nlie between 0 and 1, and the RNG score rises as particular pair combinations are \nrepeated. For example, if certain stereotyped sequences are repeatedly used such as \nadjacent values \u201c3, 4\u201d or even numbers \u201c4, 6\u201d, this will be reflected in higher RNG \nscores. RNG scores necessarily vary with the number of response permutations and \nthe sequence length. Formally, RNG scores are: \n! \nRNG =\nnij lognij\"\nni logni\"\n \nwhere nij is the frequency count from each cell in the matrix of possible combinations \nand ni represents the frequency of occurrence of response i. \n \nA \u2013 this Adjacency measure involves calculation of specific paired combination \nvalues. Whereas RNG scores measure all possible response pairs, the A score reflects \nthe percentage of adjacent response values (e.g., \u201c1, 2\u201d or \u201c4, 3) in the sequence, and \nis formally: \n! \nnumber of adjacent pairs\nnumber of response pairs\n\"100  \n \nTPI \u2013 The Turning Point Index measures the number of times responses involve a \nchange between ascending (e.g. \u201c1, 4, 9\u201d) and descending (e.g. \u201c7, 5, 2\u201d) sequences \n(the count of local peaks and troughs in a time-series plot), and then compares this \nwith an expected value; \n 32 \n! \nTPI =\nnumber of observed turning points\n2\n3\n(N \" 2)\n#100 \nwhere N is the sequence length. A TPI value less than 100 indicates fewer changes in \nthe ordinal progression of responses than would be expected of a random sequence, \nand a value greater than 100 indicates more changes than would be expected. Thus, a \nlow TPI value would suggest a response strategy involving runs of ordinal numbers. \n \nR \u2013 This is a measure of the distribution of response frequencies. That is, it indicates \nwhether some responses are produced more often than others. A (minimum) value of \n0 indicates responses are used equally, whereas a (maximum) value of 100 indicates a \nsingle value is used for all responses. Thus larger numbers indicate more bias in the \nresponse set. R is calculated as \n! \nR = 1\"\nlog2 N \"\n1\nN\nn\ni\nlog2 ni#( )\nlog2 a\n$ \n% \n& \n& \n& \n' \n( \n) \n) \n) \n*100  \nwhere a is the number of response alternatives (other symbols as used above). \n \nPhi2 and Phi7 \u2013 The Phi index measures response repetitions over different sequence \nlags, with a range of scores between -100 (repetitions occur less frequently than \nwould be expected from random sequences) and 100 (repetitions occur more \nfrequently than would be expected from random sequences). The Phi2 measure \nfocuses on immediate repetitions of a response, the Phi7 measure assesses repetitions \nthat occur after five intervening responses have been produced. The Phi Index is; \n! \n\" =\n# 2\nT\n$100  \n 33 \nwhere a chi-squared statistic is determined by comparing observed repetitions against \nexpected values (given known lower-order frequency counts), and T is an artificial \nsequence length value obtained after transforming the original sequence into binary \nstrings. \n 34 \nTable 1.
