An important contemporary version of the Boltzmannian approach\nto statistical mechanics answers this question in terms of typicality. The problem with\nthis approach is that it comes in different versions, which are, however, not recognised\nas such and not clearly distinguished. The aim of this paper is to identify three different\nversions of typicality-based explanations of thermodynamic-like behaviour and evaluate\ntheir respective success. My conclusion is that the first two are unsuccessful because they\nfail to take the system\u2019s dynamics into account. The third, however, is promising. I give\na precise formulation of the proposal and present an argument in support of its central\ncontention.\n1 Introduction\nConsider a gas confined to the left half of a container. Removing the dividing\nwall results in the gas spreading uniformly over the entire available space.\nIt has approached equilibrium. Statistical mechanics (SM) aims to explain\nthe approach to equilibrium in terms of the dynamical laws governing the\nindividual molecules of which the gas is made up. What is it about molecules\nand their motions that leads them to spread out when the wall is removed?\nAnd why does this happen invariably? That is, why do we never observe\ngases staying in the left half even after the shutter has been removed?\nAn important contemporary version of the Boltzmannian approach to\nSM, originating in the work of Joel Lebowitz (1993a, 1993b), answers these\n1\nquestions in terms of the notion of typicality. Intuitively, something is typ-\nical if it happens in the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of cases: typical lottery tickets are\nblanks, typical olympic athletes are well trained, and in a typical series of\na thousand coin tosses the ratio of the number of heads and the number of\ntails is approximately one. The aim of a typicality-based approach to SM\nis to show that approaching equilibrium is the typical behaviour of systems\nlike gases.\nThis approach has grown increasingly popular in recent years (references\nwill be given below). The problem with it is that it comes in different versions,\nwhich are, however, not recognised as such, much less clearly distinguished.\nThe aim of this paper is to distinguish three different kinds of typicality-\nbased explanation of the approach to equilibrium and evaluate their respec-\ntive success. My conclusion will be that the first two are unsuccessful because\nthey fail to take the system\u2019s dynamics into account. The third, however,\nis promising. I give a precise formulation of the proposal and present the\noutline of a proof of its central contention.\n2 Classical Boltzmannian SM\nConsider a system consisting of n classical particles with three degrees of\nfreedom each. The state of this system is specified by a point x, also referred\nto as the system\u2019s microstate, in its 6n-dimensional phase space \u0393, which is\nendowed with the Lebesgue measure \u00b5\nL\n. The dynamics of the system is gov-\nerned by Hamilton\u2019s equations of motion, which define a measure preserving\nflow \u03c6t on \u0393, meaning that for all times t \u03c6t : \u0393\u2192 \u0393 is a one-to-one mapping\nsuch that \u00b5(R) = \u00b5(\u03c6t(R)) for all measurable R \u2286 \u0393. The system\u2019s mi-\ncrostate at time t0 (its \u2018initial condition\u2019), x(t0), evolves into x(t) = \u03c6t(x(t0))\nat time t. In a Hamiltonian system energy is conserved and hence the motion\nof the system is confined to the 6n\u2212 1 dimensional energy hypersurface \u0393E.\nThe measure \u00b5\nL\ncan be restricted to \u0393E, which induces a natural invariant\nmeasure \u00b5 on \u0393E.\nTo each macrostate Mi of the system, i = 1, ...,m, there corresponds a\nmacro-region \u0393Mi consisting of all x \u2208 \u0393E for which the macroscopic variables\nassume the values characteristic for Mi. The \u0393Mi together form a partition\nof \u0393E, meaning that they do not overlap and jointly cover \u0393E up to measure\nzero. The Boltzmann entropy of a macrostate Mi is defined as SB(Mi) :=\nk\nB\nlog[\u00b5(\u0393Mi)], where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Given this, we define\n2\nthe Boltzmann entropy of a system at time t, S\nB\n(t), as the entropy of the\nsystem\u2019s macrostate at t: S\nB\n(t) := S\nB\n(Mx(t)), where x(t) is the system\u2019s\nmicrostate at t and Mx(t) is the macrostate corresponding to x(t).\nAmong the macrostates of a system two are of particular importance, the\nequilibrium state,Meq, and the system\u2019s state at the beginning of the process,\nMp (also referred to as the \u2018past state\u2019). The latter is, by assumption, a low\nentropy state.1 The idea now is that the behaviour of S\nB\n(t) should mirror\nthe behaviour of the thermodynamic entropy S\nTD\n, at least approximately.2\nSo we expect the Boltzmann entropy of a system initially prepared in Mp to\nincrease more or less monotonically, reach its maximum fairly quickly, and\nthen remain at or near the maximum for a long time. In other words, we\nexpect the dynamics to be such that it carries the system\u2019s initial state x(t0) \u2208\n\u0393Mp into \u0393Meq reasonably quickly and then keeps it there for a long time. I\nrefer to this as \u2018thermodynamic-like behaviour\u2019.3 The explanandum then is\nthis: why does the system under investigation behave in a thermodynamic-\nlike way?\nThe standard Boltzmannian response to this question is to introduce\nprobabilities and argue that the values of these probabilities come out such\nthat the system is overwhelmingly likely to evolve in a thermodynamic-\nlike way.4 Typicality approaches to SM eschew commitment to probabil-\nities and offer a different kind of explanation: the systems behaves in a\nthermodynamic-like way because it is typical for systems of this kind to be-\nhave in this way.5\nBefore turning to a discussion of this approach, an important technical\nresult needs to be stated. Under certain conditions it is the case that \u0393Meq\n1If we study laboratory systems like the above-mentioned gas, Mp has low entropy by\nconstruction. If we take the universe as a whole to be the object of study, then that Mp\nbe of low entropy is the subject matter of the so-called \u2018Past Hypothesis\u2019 (Albert 2000,\n96).\n2This \u2018mirroring\u2019 need not be perfect and occasional deviations of the Boltzmann en-\ntropy from its thermodynamic counterpart are no cause for concern (Callender 2001).\n3This definition of thermodynamic-like behaviour is the one adopted by those writing\non typicality; see, for instance Goldstein (2001, 43-44). Lavis (2005, 255) gives a somewhat\ndifferent definition. These differences are inconsequential for what follows.\n4A discussion of the different ways of introducing probabilities into the Boltzmannian\nframework can be found in Frigg (2009).\n5This explanatory strategy is reminiscent of probabilistic explanations appealing to\nhigh probabilities, and hence is open to similar objections. For the sake of argument I set\nthese worries aside and accept that something being typical has explanatory power.\n3\nis vastly larger (with respect to \u00b5) than any other macro-region. I refer to\nthis matter of fact as the \u2018dominance of the equilibrium macrostate\u2019. This\ndominance is then often glossed as being equivalent that for large n, \u0393E is\nalmost entirely taken up by equilibrium microstates (Bricmont 1995, 146;\nGoldstein 2001, 45; Zangh`\u0131 2005, 191, 196).\nSome caution is needed here. In certain systems non-equilibrium states\ncan take up a substantial part of the phase space due to the degeneracy of\nbelow-equilibrium entropy values, and hence it not true that \u0393E is almost\nentirely filled with equilibrium states (Lavis 2005, 255-258; 2008, Sec. 2).\nHowever, it turns out that those non-equilibrium states that occupy most\nof the non-equilibrium area are close to equilibrium (in the sense of having\nclose to equilibrium entropy values). We can then lump the equilibrium and\nthese close-to-equilibrium states together and get an \u2018equilibrium or almost\nequilibrium\u2019 region, which indeed takes up most of \u0393E. The approach to equi-\nlibrium has then to be understood as the approach to this this \u2018equilibrium or\nalmost equilibrium\u2019 state, which is sufficient to give us thermodynamic-like\nbehaviour in the sense introduced above.\n3 Typicality\nConsider an element e of a set \u03a3. Typicality is a relational property of e,\nwhich e posses with respect to \u03a3, a property P and a measure \u03bd, often referred\nto as \u2018tyicality measure\u2019. Roughly speaking, e is typical if most members of\n\u03a3 have property P and e is one of them. More precisely, let \u03a0 be the subset\nof \u03a3 consisting of all elements that have property P . Then the element e is\ntypical iff e \u2208 \u03a0 and \u03bd\n\u03a3\n(\u03a0) := \u03bd(\u03a0)\/\u03bd(\u03a3) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b5, where \u03b5 \u2265 0 is a small\nreal number; \u03bd\n\u03a3\n( \u00b7 ) is referred to as the \u2018measure conditional on \u03a3\u2019, or simply\n\u2018conditional measure\u2019.6 Derivatively, one can then refer to \u03a0 as the \u2018typical\nset\u2019 and to those elements that possess property P (i.e. the members of \u03a0) as\n\u2018typical elements\u2019. Conversely, an element e is atypical iff it belongs to the\ncomplement of \u03a0, \u2126 := \u03a3 \\ \u03a0, in which case we refer to \u2126 as the \u2018atypical\nset\u2019 and to its members as \u2018atypical elements\u2019.\nAs an example consider the number pi, which is typical with respect to\nthe interval [0, 1], the property \u2018not being specifiable by a finite number of\ndigits\u2019 and the usual Lebesgue measure on the real numbers, because it is a\n6This definition of typicality is adapted from Du\u00a8rr (1998, Sec. 2), Lavis (2005, 258),\nZangh`\u0131 (2005, 185), and Volchan (2007, 805).\n4\ntheorem of number theory that the set of all numbers that have this property\nhas measure one.\nThe element of interest in SM is a microstate x, and it is generally agreed\nthat the relevant measure is the Lebesgue measure \u00b5. However, views diverge\nwhen it comes to specifying the relevant set \u03a3 and relevant property P .\nI now turn to a discussion of three different typicality-based accounts of\nSM that emerge from the writings of Goldstein, Lebowitz, and Zangh`\u0131. In\nconversation Goldstein and Zangh`\u0131 have pointed out to me that they would\nnot subscribe to Accounts 1 and 2 and that (something like) Account 3 is\nwhat they had intended. However, since the relevant papers can reasonably\nbe read as proposing Accounts 1 and 2 it worth discussing them briefly to set\nthe record straight (Sections 4 and 5) before turning to a detailed discussion\nof Account 3 (Section 6).\n4 First Account\nThe first account sets out to explain the approach to equilibrium in terms of\nthe dominance of the equilibrium macrostate. Zangh`\u0131 explains:\n\u2018reaching the equilibrium distribution in the course of the tem-\nporal evolution of a system is inevitable due to the fact that the\noverwhelming majority of microstates in the phase space have this\ndistribution; a fact often not understood by the critics of Boltz-\nmann [...]\u2019 (Zangh`\u0131 2005, 196, my translation)\nOn this view, then, a system approaches equilibrium simply because the over-\nwhelming majority of states in \u0393E are equilibrium microstates. If we now\nassociate \u03a3 with \u0393E and property P with \u2018being an equilibrium state\u2019 (and,\nas indicated above, regard microstates as elements of interest and use the\nLebesgue measure \u00b5 as typicality measure), the dominance of the equilib-\nrium macrostate implies that equilibrium microstates are typical, and the\nview put forward in the above quote can be summarised as the claim that\nsystems approach equilibrium because equilibrium microstates are typical\nand non-equilibrium microstates are atypical.\nThis explanation is unsuccessful. If a system is in an atypical microstate,\nit does not evolve into an equilibrium microstate just because the latter\nare typical. Typical states do not automatically attract trajectories.7 In\n7Uffink (2007, 979-980) illustrates this with the example of a trajectory.\n5\nfact there are Hamiltonians \u2013 for instance the null Hamiltonian or a collec-\ntion of uncoupled harmonic oscillators \u2013 that give raise to a dynamics that\ndoes not carry non-equilibrium states into equilibrium. To explain why non-\nequilibrium microstates eventually wind up in equilibrium the typicality of\n\u0393Meq is not enough and appeal has to be made to the system\u2019s dynamics.\n5 Second Account\nAn different line of argument can be found in Lebowitz (1993a, 1993b, 1999)\nand Lebowitz & Goldstein (2004). This account differs from the above in\nthat it focusses on the internal structure of the micro-regions \u0393Mi rather\nthan the entire phase space:\n\u2018By \u201ctypicality\u201d we mean that for any [\u0393Mi ] [...] the relative volume\nof the set of microstates [x] in [\u0393Mi ] for which the second law is\nviolated [...] goes to zero rapidly (exponentially) in the number of\natoms and molecules in the system.\u2019 (Goldstein & Lebowitz 2004,\n57)8\nThis definition contains different elements that need to be distinguished.\nLet \u0393\n(++)\nMi\nbe the subset of \u0393Mi containing all x that lie on trajectories that\ncome into \u0393Mi from a macrostate of higher entropy and that leave \u0393Mi en-\ntering into a macrostate of higher entropy; \u0393\n(+\u2212)\nMi\n, \u0393\n(\u2212+)\nMi\nand \u0393\n(\u2212\u2212)\nMi\nare de-\nfined accordingly. These four subsets form a partition of \u0393Mi . Furthermore,\n\u0393\n(+)\nMi\n:= \u0393\n(++)\nMi\n\u222a \u0393(\u2212+)Mi and \u0393(\u2212)Mi := \u0393(+\u2212)Mi \u222a \u0393(\u2212\u2212)Mi are the subsets of \u0393Mi that\nhave a higher and lower entropy future respectively.\nThere is an interpretative question about how to understand the notion\nof a set of microstates in \u0393Mi violating the Second Law. A plausible reading\ntakes these to be states that have an entropy decreasing future. Let us call\nthis property D. Hence, x has D iff x \u2208 \u0393(\u2212)Mi . Entropy decreasing states are\natypical in \u0393Mi iff \u00b5i(\u0393\n(\u2212)\nMi\n) < \u03b5, where \u00b5i( \u00b7 ) := \u00b5( \u00b7 )\/\u00b5(\u0393Mi). Furthermore let\nus say that a system is globally entropy decreasing, GD, iff entropy decreasing\nstates microstates are atypical in every \u0393Mi . The claim made in the above\nquote then is tantamount to saying that a system with a reasonably large\nnumber of molecules is GD.\n8Square brackets indicate that the original notation has been replaced by the notion\nused in this paper. I will use this convention throughout.\n6\nThis claim needs to be qualified. The atypicality of x with property D\nin \u0393Mi trivially implies \u00b5(\u0393\n(+\u2212)\nMi\n) < \u03b5. Due to the time reversal invariance\nof the Hamiltonian dynamics we have \u00b5(\u0393\n(\u2212+)\nMi\n) = \u00b5(\u0393\n(+\u2212)\nMi\n) and therefore\n\u00b5(\u0393\n(\u2212+)\nMi\n) < \u03b5. Since \u0393\n(+)\nMi\n= \u0393\n(\u2212+)\nMi\n\u222a \u0393(++)Mi we obtain \u00b5(\u0393(++)Mi ) > 1 \u2212 2\u03b5.\nHence, even if x with property D are atypical in \u0393Mi , it is not the case\nthat, as we would expect, most states in \u0393Mi behave thermodynamic-like\nsince most states have a higher entropy past ! But this is a familiar problem\nand remedy can be found in conditionalising on \u0393Mp (Albert 2000, Ch. 4).\n9\nSo the correct requirement is that, at any time t, microstates violating the\nSecond Law must be atypical in \u0393Mi \u2229 \u03c6t(\u0393Mp) rather than only \u0393Mi .\nDo relevant systems meet this requirement? Immediately after the passe\nquoted above Goldstein & Lebowitz offer the following answer:\n\u2018Boltzmann then argued that given this disparity in sizes of differ-\nent M \u2019s, the time evolved [Mx(t)] will be such that [\u00b5(Mx(t))] and\nthus [SB(t)] will typically increase in accord with the law.\u2019 (2004,\n57)\nSo the argument seems to be that the relevant condition must be true because\nthe equilibrium state is much larger than other macrostates.\nThis is unconvincing. The disparity of sizes of macro-regions is, of course,\ncompatible with being GD, but the latter does not follow from the former.\nWhether macro-regions have the above internal structure depends on the\nsystem\u2019s phase flow \u03c6t and every attempt to answer this question without\neven mentioning the system\u2019s dynamics is doomed to failure right from the\nstart (and this is true both of the qualified and the unqualified version of the\nclaim).\n6 Third Account\nAs we have seen, the basic problem with the two accounts discussed so far is\nthat they attempt to explain the approach to equilibrium without reference\nto the system\u2019s dynamics. The third account, which emerges from a passage\nin Goldstein\u2019s (2001), rectifies this problem:\n9Notice that an attempt do define D in terms of \u0393(\u2212)Mi \u222a \u0393\n(++)\nMi\nrather than only \u0393(\u2212)Mi\nleads to a contradiction.\n7\n\u2018[\u0393E] consists almost entirely of phase points in the equilibrium\nmacrostate [\u0393Meq ], with ridiculously few exceptions whose total-\nity has volume of order 10\u221210\n20\nrelative to that of [\u0393E]. For a\nnon-equilibrium phase point [x] of energy E, the Hamiltonian dy-\nnamics governing the motion [x(t)] would have to be ridiculously\nspecial to avoid reasonably quickly carrying [x(t)] into [\u0393Meq ] and\nkeeping it there for an extremely long time \u2013 unless, of course, [x]\nitself were ridiculously special.\u2019 (Goldstein 2001, 43-44)\nThis is an interesting claim, but one that stands in need of clarification. A\nreasonable reading of this passage seems to be that an argument involving\nthree different typicality claims is made:\nPremise 1 : The system\u2019s macrostate structure is such that equi-\nlibrium states are typical in \u0393E in the sense introduced in Section\n4.\nPremise 2 : The system\u2019s Hamiltonian is typical in the class of all\nHamiltonians.\nConclusion: Initial conditions lying on trajectories showing thermodynamic-\nlike behaviour are typical in \u0393Mp with respect to \u00b5p( \u00b7 ) := \u00b5( \u00b7 )\/ \u00b5(\u0393Mp).\nLet us refer to this as the \u2018T-Argument\u2019. Premise 1 is familiar from Section 4\nand is taken for granted here. Premise 2 and the conclusion are restatements\nin the language of typicality of the claims that the Hamiltonian of the system\nand the initial condition be not \u2018ridiculously special\u2019.\nThe T-Argument, if sound, gives us the sought-after explanation of the\napproach to equilibrium in terms of typicality. But before we can address\nthe question of soundness we need to make Premise 2 more precise. What\ndoes it mean for a system\u2019s Hamiltonian to be typical in the class of all\nHamiltonians? More specifically, what is the typicality measure and what is\nthe relevant property P?\nLet us begin with the first question. The problem is that function spaces\ndo not come equipped with normalised measures that can plausibly be used to\ncapture the intuitive idea that some sets of functions are typical while others\nare atypical. A natural way around this difficulty is to replace the measure\ntheoretic notion of typicality introduced in Section 3 by a topological one\nbased on Baire categories for an introduction). Sets can be of two kinds:\nmeagre (first Baire category) or nonmeagre (second Baire category). Loosely\n8\nspeaking, a meagre set is the \u2018topological counterpart\u2019 of a set of measure\nzero in measure theory, and a nonmeagre set is the \u2018counterpart\u2019 of a set\nof non-zero measure. Given this, it is natural to say that meagre sets are\natypical and nonmeagre sets are typical. I call this notion of typicality \u2018t-\ntypicality\u2019 (\u2018t\u2019 for \u2018topological\u2019) and, to avoid confusion, from now on refer\nto the notion of typicality introduced in Section 3 as \u2018m-typicality\u2019 in order\nto make it explicit that it is a measure theoretic notion.\nUnfortunately there is no straightforward answer to the question about\nthe property P . But a more promising line of argument emerges from Du\u00a8rr\u2019s\n(1998) and Maudlin\u2019s (2007) discussion of typicality in the so-called Galton\nBoard, a triangular arrangement of nails on an infinitely long vertical board.\nBalls are fed into the board from the top and then move down the board.\nEvery time a ball collides with a nail it moves either to the right (R) or to the\nleft (L). If we follow a ball\u2019s trajectory and take down whether it moves to\nthe left or to the right every time it hits a nail, we obtain a string of R\u2019s and\nL\u2019s that looks as random as one that has been generated by a coin toss: the\nGalton Board seems to exhibit random behaviour. Why is this? Du\u00a8rr\u2019s and\nMaudlin\u2019s answer is that the Board appears random because random looking\ntrajectories are typical in the sense that the set of those initial conditions\nthat give rise to non-random looking trajectories has measure zero in the set\nof all possible initial conditions, and this is so because the board\u2019s dynamics\nis chaotic (Du\u00a8rr 1998, Sec. 2).\nTranslating this idea into the context of SM suggests that the relevant\nproperty P is being chaotic. This sounds prima facie plausible, and, most im-\nportantly, would make Premise 2 true. Markus & Meyer prove the following\ntheorem:\nCompletely integrable Hamiltonians are meagre in the space of all\nnormalised and infinitely differentiable Hamiltonians on a compact\nsymplectic manyfold. (1974, 13)10\nThis implies that non-integrable Hamiltonians are nonmeagre, which is tan-\ntamount to saying that the class of chaotic Hamiltonians is nonmeagre,11 and\n10Two Hamiltonians that only differ by a constant are considered equivalent, and an\nequivalence class of Hamiltonians is called a \u2018normalised Hamiltonian\u2019. This is because in\npractical calculations any Hamiltonian of this class can be chosen as a representative since\nthey all yield the same flow (Markus & Meyer 1974, 11).\n11I here follow common practice and assume that non-integrability implies chaos, at\nleast on some region of the phase space. However, to the best of my knowledge there is\n9\nhence t-typical.12\nThe question now is whether the T-Argument valid, i.e. whether the con-\nclusion follows from the premises. This turns out to be a thorny issue. There\nis an entire class of systems that are chaotic but whose phase space is full\nof invariant curves, namely so-called KAM systems (Argyris, Faust & Haase\n1994, Ch. 4). Naturally one would expect these curves to divide \u0393E into a\nset of closed volumes bounded by the invariant curves, which would prevent\nthe system from approaching equilibrium (invariant curves are ubiquitous in\nKAM systems and so it would be highly unlikely that \u0393Mp and \u0393Meq would\nnot be separated by one). In systems with two degrees of freedom this is ex-\nactly what happens: the two dimensional invariant surfaces divide the three\ndimensional energy hypersurface in disconnected parts. Fortunately the sit-\nuation is better for systems with f > 2 degrees of freedom. The energy\nhypersurface has 2f \u2212 1 dimensions, and for another surface to divide it into\ntwo disconnected parts it must have 2f \u2212 2 dimensions. But the invariant\nKAM tori are f -dimensional, and since 2f \u2212 2 > f for all f > 2 invariant\nKAM surfaces do not divide \u0393E into separate parts; the invariant surfaces are\na bit like lines in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. So the trajectories\ncan, in principle, wander around relatively unhindered and without being\n\u2018sandwiched\u2019 between invariant surfaces. This process is known as Arnold\nDiffusion. It has first been proven analytically to exist in a particular exam-\nple, and there is now numerical evidence that it can also be found in other\nsystems. In such systems the chaotic parts of \u0393E are connected and form a\nsingle net, the so-called Arnold Web, which permeates the entire phase space\nin the sense that a trajectory moving on the web will eventually visit almost\nevery finite region of \u0393E.\n13\nThis looks like what we need, but unfortunately some difficulties arise on\nthe finishing line. These can be circumvented only at the cost of accepting\nthree conjectures, which are only supported by plausibility arguments.\nFirst, there is no proof for the existence of Arnold webs in all noninte-\ngrable systems with f > 2. The good news is that so far there are no known\nexamples where this is not the case, and so we can venture the conjecture\nthat all nonintegrable systems with f > 2 have Arnold Webs (Conjecture\nno strict mathematical proof of this.\n12Mathematicians refer to t-typical Hamiltonians as \u2018generic\u2019.\n13In fact, Ott (1993, 257) and Lichtenberg & Liebernmann (1992, 61) say that the\nsystem visits every finite region of \u0393E , but this seems to be too strong.\n10\n1).14\nSecond, there is a question about the relative measure in \u0393E occupied\nby Arnold Webs. It could in principle be that these webs are of measure\nzero, or else only fill a small part of the phase space. If this were the case,\nit would be unlikely that m-typical initial conditions would come to lie on\ntrajectories that wander around randomly (and therefore wind up in \u0393Meq),\nwhich would undercut the conclusion in the T-Argument. However, numer-\nical simulations on simple systems have shown that the relative measure\noccupied by invariant KAM curves decreases as f increases (Earman & Re-\ndei 1996, 70). Furthermore, Sklar (1993, 175) observes that there are good\nnumerical reasons to think that large systems are \u2018at least ergodic-like\u2019 on\nthe \u2018overwhelmingly largest part\u2019 of the accessible part of the phase space,\nand Vranas (1998, 695-698) gathers a welter of numerical evidence for the\nconclusion that many systems of interest in SM are \u03b5-ergodic, i.e. ergodic on\nnearly the entire energy hypersurface. This suggests that it may well be the\ncase that Arnold webs not only have finite measure, but that they in fact fill\nmost of \u0393E (Conjecture 2).\nThird, in order to explain thermodynamic-like behaviour we need to know\nhow how much time the system spends in different parts of the phase space.\nAgain, little is proven rigorously, but Ott (1993, 257) suggests that system\nis ergodic on the Arnold Web (Conjecture 3). The numerical evidence just\nmentioned supports this conjecture.\nIf we assume that these three assumptions are correct, then the T-Argument\nis sound. By Premise 2 the system is chaotic, and by Conjecture 1 it has\nan Arnold Web, which, by Conjecture 2, fills most of the energy surface and\nhence most of \u0393Mp . Therefore points on the Web are m-typical in \u0393Mp . By\nConjecture 3, these points wander around ergocially on the Web and hence\napproach \u0393Meq fairly soon and stay there for a long time (where \u2018fairly soon\u2019\nmeans that the time taken to arrive at equilibrium is much shorter than\nthe time spent in equilibrium) because, by Premise 1, non-equilibrium states\noccupy a much smaller volume that equilibrium states.\nTo put this argument on secure footing, more would have to be said about\nthe three conjectures. This is an extremely difficult task, and so it is worth\nasking whether there is not a simpler way to arrive at the same conclusion. I\nwill now discuss a plausible way of doing so and show that it is a blind alley.\n14Or if not all nonintegrable systems have Arnold Webs, then those that don\u2019t should\nbe so few that the class of those with Arnold Webs is still nonmeagre.\n11\nHence there is no way around trying to make progress on the conjectures.\nThe new line of argument departs from the observation that we might\nhave chosen too liberal a notion of chaos. In fact, there is a great deal of\ncontroversy over the correct characterisation of chaos (Smith 1998, Ch. 10),\nand so we might say that KAM systems show the wrong kind of chaotic\nbehaviour: they exhibit \u2018local chaos\u2019, meaning that the dynamics is chaotic\nonly on parts of the phase space. What we need, so the argument goes, is that\nthe relevant systems show \u2018global chaos\u2019, which disqualifies KAM systems.\nThe question then becomes how to characterise global chaos. Commonly\nthis is done either of two ways, a topological and a measure-theoretic one.\nThe former always involves ergodicity, and is therefore untenable: Markus\n& Meyer (1974, 14) also prove that in the space of all normalised and in-\nfinitely differentiable Hamiltonians on a compact symplectic manyfold the\nclass of ergodic Hamiltonians is meagre, and hence strongly chaotic systems\nare t-atypical. Topological definitions of chaos (the best know of which is\nis Devaney\u2019s) always involve topologically transitivity, the condition that for\nany two open regions A and B in \u0393E, there is a trajectory initiating in A\nthat eventually visits B. But this condition does not fit the bill: while it\nis at least plausible that topological chaos is a sufficient condition for the\napproach to equilibrium, it requires a revision of P that seems to render\nPremise 2 false. As Markus & Meyer (ibid., 1) point out, ergodic systems\nare meagre because generic systems have invariant surfaces preventing the\ntrajectory from accessing the entire phase energy hypersurface. But a system\nthat cannot access certain regions of \u0393E not only fails to be ergodic; it also\nfails to be topologically transitive. So topologically transitive systems must\nbe meagre too, and hence also fail to be t-typical. For this reason shifting\nattention to global chaos is a dead end.\n7 Conclusion\nI have distinguished three different accounts of how typicality is used to\nexplain thermodynamic-like behaviour. I have argued that wile the first\ntwo fail, the third is promising and I have sketched a proof. The proof\nrests on three conjectures which need to be further substantiated to put the\nargument on secure footing. Furthermore, an argument needs to be given\nthat m-typicality and t-typicality have explanatory power from the point of\nview of physics.\n12\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks goes to Charlotte Werndl for invaluable discussions about\ndynamical systems.
