This paper examines the increased potential risk of tidal inundations in the Pearl River\ndelta, China, due to future rises in sea level. The research is based on tidal records of 54 tide gauges\ndistributed across the delta plain, and employs mathematical calculations to predict potential rises of\nwater level in different parts of the delta under a number of flood scenarios. After assessing a 72-year\ntidal record of Hong Kong and factors such as estuarine backwater effects and long-term geological\nsubsidence, it suggests that a 30 cm rise in relative sea level at the mouth of the estuary is possible\nby 2030. Based on the prediction and five freshwater discharge scenarios, the potential impacts in\nwater level across the delta plain are calculated. Three zones are identified as least affected, heavily\naffected and severely affected. The impacts are also translated into return periods of water level. It\nis suggested that in a large part of the delta plain, return periods will be shortened and hence will\nbe increasingly vulnerable to tidal inundation. Finally, management implications are discussed along\nwith assessment of adequacy of the existing tidal flood defences, as well as evaluation of the cost\nimplications if they are to be improved.\nKey words: sea-level rise, tidal inundation, flood defences, management implications, Pearl River\ndelta\n1. Introduction\nAccording to the Inter-governmental Panel of Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC, 1996)\nIS92a emission scenario, assuming the \u2018best estimate\u2019 of climate sensitivity, global\nmean temperature increase by 2100 is about 2.4 \u25e6C. The associated global mean\nsea-level rise is projected as 49 cm. The IPCC\u2019s (2001a) recent report confirms that\nthe 49 cm is the best estimate and the predicted range is between 20 cm and 86 cm.\nHowever, changes in future sea level will not occur uniformly around the globe.\nRegional responses could in fact differ substantially, owing to regional differences\nin heating and circulation changes. Tides, waves and storm surges could also be\naffected by regional climate changes. Nevertheless, such a rise in sea level will\npose severe threats to, or will degrade, coastal infrastructure such as flood defence\n(IPCC, 2001b). The magnitude of sea-level rise may be reduced if some mitigation\nmeasures are implemented, but the effects of the mitigation may not be realised\n\u0001 Author for correspondence: E-mail: y.q.zong@durham.ac.uk\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.1\nFIRST PROOF.

Therefore, coastal societies have to face the threats of\nsea-level rise for at least the next few decades.\nImpacts of future sea-level rise on the socio-economic development of major\ncoastal cities in China have been a main focus of recent research. Han et al. (1995)\nprovided a brief national assessment of the impacts for China. Wang et al. (1995),\nand Chen and Zong (1999) examined the implications of sea-level rise on socio-\neconomic development and agriculture for Shanghai, whilst Yim (1995) assessed\nthe likely impacts on land reclamation projects in Hong Kong. During the 1990s,\nin the Pearl River delta, a number of research projects were carried out to identify\nthe possible impacts of future sea-level rises. These research projects focused on\nsocio-economic development (e.g., Li et al., 1993) and the environment, the latter\nincluding saline water intrusion (e.g., Fan, 1994), inter-tidal environment (e.g.,\nHuang, 2000), as well as flood hazards.\nIn order to quantify the socio-economic impacts of future sea-level rises, re-\nsearches need to project the potential physical consequences rising sea level may\nresult in. Impacts of sea-level rise on a coastal lowland are usually multiple. This\nincludes an increase in the frequency of coastal inundation. In turn, potentially\naffected areas may be extended due to estuarine backwater effects, or certain areas\nmay become hazardous due to rising water levels. Ultimately, human lives and\nlivelihoods will increasingly rely on the protection offered by sea\/flood defences.\nAlthough the risk of an area being inundated by the sea is determined by a combin-\nation of many factors, including tidal waves and typhoon storm surges, this paper\nwill focus on the prediction of water level across the deltaic plain based on the\nestimated sea-level rise and effects of estuarine backwater. This paper will also\nassess management implications such as the effectiveness of the current sea\/flood\ndefences.\n2. The Pearl River Delta\nThe Pearl River is the collective name of three rivers: the East River, the North\nRiver and the West River. These three rivers drain the southern part of China and\nconverge together in the Pearl River delta (Figure 1). The delta plain started to\nemerge some 2000 years ago (Li and Qiao, 1982) and has expanded rapidly over\nthe last few centuries. The unique feature of the Pearl River delta is its complex\ntributary network, with a density of 0.68 km\/km2 to 1.10 km\/km2 at different parts\nof the delta plain.\nAt present, the Pearl River delta covers 9750 km2, and is the third largest delta\nin China. Within the northern fringe of the delta plain (Figure 2), the ground level\nis generally over 2.4 m above mean sea level (MSL), with numerous localised\ndepressions ranging from 0.2 m to \u22120.1 m relative to MSL. The ground altitude of\nthe northern and central parts of the delta is between 0.4 m to 2.4 m above MSL.\nThe ground level of the southern part of the delta is slightly lower, ranging from\n0.4 m to \u22120.3 m relative to MSL. Average tidal range within the estuary ranges\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.2\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 3\nFigure 1. Location of the Pearl River Delta.\nfrom 0.86 m at the mouth to 1.57 m at the head of the estuary, but increases to\nbetween 2.29 m and 3.36 m during astronomical tides.\nThe northern fringe of the delta plain was reclaimed as early as the Tang Dyn-\nasty, c. 1400 years ago, and the speed of reclamation has gradually increased since\nthen. During the past 50 years, reclaimed lands were merged into just over 100\nenclosures (called Wei in Chinese). Each enclosure is protected by flood defences,\nand between enclosures are tributaries or tidal channels. In 1998, there were flood\ndefences of 3057.6 km in total length in the delta plain.\nBeing the area of most rapid economic development in China, the delta has\na population of over 12 million, and a population density of 1230 persons\/km2.\nThere are 16 cities, including Guangzhou, the provincial capital. Up to 64% of the\npopulation are urban residents, and the area is highly industrialised. By the year\n2000, the GDP of the delta accounts for c. 59% of the provincial total. However, the\nhuman lives and economic assets have always been under threats of natural hazards,\nincluding river flood, waterlog, wind storm (typhoon), tidal flood and saline water.\nThese hazards will no doubt be intensified by the predicted rise in sea level. Current\nand future economic developments will also increase socio-economic exposure\nto such hazards. If the projected rise in sea level will increase the livelihood of\nthe deltaic lowlands being inundated by the sea, there is then an urgent need to\nunderstand the potential extent of hazardous sea inundations, in order for adaptive\nmeasures be designed and implemented accordingly.\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.3\n4 ZHENGUO HUANG ET AL.\nFigure 2. This map shows the Pearl River deltaic plain with ground altitudes above mean sea\nlevel.\n3. Methodology\nThis paper follows the methodology similar to that suggested by Parry and Carter\n(1998). After the problems being defined as shown in previous section, it is to\ndevelop the scenarios of sea-level rise by examining the following factors. Firstly,\ntidal records from a number of tide gauges are used to calculate the secular trend\nof mean sea level which is then compared with the IPCC prediction. Secondly,\nthe tidal records are used again to estimate the average magnitude of mean sea-\nlevel fluctuations, because inundations are more likely to happen during periods of\nhigher mean sea level. Thirdly, as water levels within the delta are influenced by\nthe freshwater discharges, the additional heights in water level induced by various\nfreshwater discharges are calculated. Fourthly, long-term ground subsidence due to\ntectonic movement and sediment compaction is also estimated.\nBased on the various sea-level scenarios, this paper assesses one of the likely\nimpacts, i.e., the geographical extent of future floods. The definition of affected\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.4\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 5\nareas is based on the calculation of return periods for highest water level at a\nnumber of locations across the delta and ground altitudes shown on the 1:10,000\nscale topographic maps which were surveyed and published after 1980 and depict\nground altitudes accurate to 0.1 m. These areas are mapped and these maps then\nbecome the basis for the assessment of flood vulnerability of the deltaic plain. This\nleads to the next stage of study, evaluating management implications and adaptive\nresponses. The benefit of sea\/flood defences and the possible cost for any future\nenhancement are calculated according to the need and level of protection.\nThis research uses a large amount of tidal records from a total of 54 tide gauges\n(Figure 3), as well as socio-economic data from the Pearl River delta. A number\nof statistical methods (i.e., one-dimensional and two-dimensional hydraulic models\nfor steady flows) are applied, and the calculations are based on the post-1980s topo-\ngraphic data at 1:10,000 scale. The tributary network is divided into 255 sections,\nand a total of 948 cross sections are used for the calculation.\n4. The Magnitude of Sea-level Rise by 2030\nThe magnitude of mean sea-level rise in the Pearl River delta between 1990 and\n2030 has been predicted as 20 cm to 25 cm (Ren, 1993), 25 cm to 30 cm (Li et al.,\n1993), or 30 cm to 40 cm (Chinese Academy of Science, 1994). These predictions\nwere mostly crude estimates based on some tide-gauge records. The current study\nexamines three factors that all play a part in future sea-level rise in the Pearl River\ndelta.\nWithin the Pearl River delta area there are two tide gauges at Hong Kong and\nMacau respectively, both started from 1925 and are the longest serving tide gauges\nin southern China. However, there are gaps in tidal records from both gauges.\nThere is no record for 1930\u20131949 at Hong Kong, whilst the Macau station moved\nthree times during 1963\u20131981. This study, therefore, takes the year 1959 as the\nconnection point to combine the two data sets. As a result, the monthly mean sea-\nlevel records from Macau are added to the Hong Kong data set and form a 72-year\nseries (1925\u20131958 from Macau and 1959\u20131996 from Hong Kong, Figure 4).\nAfter the data being filtered by a series of low passes, a single-order linear\nregression is applied to produce an average annual rate of sea-level movement. The\nresult indicates that the rate of sea level rise at the mouth of the Pearl River estuary\nis 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 mm\/a between 1925 and 1996. This rate is close to the estimate of\nbetween 1 mm\/a and 2 mm\/a for China by Ren (1993) and for the global average\n(Gornitz, 1995). Given the fact that the geology of the sites of the two tide gauges\nis relatively stable (Yim, 1995), this value (1.8 mm\/a) can be used as a conservative\nestimate of sea level rise for the period up to 2030.\nBy applying a multiple-order non-linear regression to the data set, the following\nequation has been formulated:\nZ(t) = 40.85 + 6.19 \u00d7 10\u221212t4. (1)\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.5\n6 ZHENGUO HUANG ET AL.\nFigure 3. Locations of the 54 tide gauges with records of 40 years. Names for 17 of the tide\ngauges are listed.\nHere, Z is the magnitude of sea-level rise, and t is time. This formula implies that\nsea level has been rising exponentially. From this formula, the rates of sea-level\nrise for the early part of the record are 1.7 mm\/a, and 2.0 mm\/a for the 1990s. This\ntrend therefore fits the global trend (e.g., IPCC, 2001a). In order words, sea level\nin the Pearl River delta may have risen by 8 cm to 12 cm by the year 2030 (i.e., the\nIPCC prediction).\nThe second factor to be considered is the magnitude of sea level variations from\nthe mean for areas within the estuary, because the rise in sea level within the estuary\nmay not be the same as the eustatic rise of sea level at the mouth of the estuary.\nThe calculation is based on the equation,\n\u00b1\u0002A = |Z\u2032(t) \u2212 Z(t)|\/n. (2)\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.6\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 7\nFigure 4. The mean sea level observed from Macau and Hong Kong indicates a secular trend\nof 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 mm\/a for the period between 1925 and 1996.\nHere, A is the variation of mean sea level; Z\u2032(t), the observed tide gauge record\nfor the given year; Z(t), the calculated tidal value for the corresponding year using\nEquation (1); and n, the number of years. Tidal data for 1955\u20131994 from 7 gauges\nof the estuary (3 from the mouth of the estuary and 4 from within the estuary) are\nanalysed. The results show that the average magnitude of annual mean sea-level\nvariations from the long-term mean is around 6.4 cm at the mouth of the estuary,\nand the magnitude increases to 12.1 cm inside the estuary (Table 1). The higher\nmagnitude inside the estuary may reflect changes of geometry in the estuary or tidal\namplification within the estuary. The present-day maximum tidal range increases\nup-estuary from 2.34 m near Hong Kong, to 3.31 m at Zhe-wan, and to 3.35 m at\nNan-sha (see Figure 3 for locations).\nThe third factor is the amount of ground movement due to geological subsidence\nand sediment compaction. According to the repeated survey from 1951 to 1989,\nground surface of the delta plain has subsided at a rate of 1.5 to 2.0 mm\/a during\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.7\n8 ZHENGUO HUANG ET AL.\nTable I.

Therefore, a total of 6 cm to 8 cm subsidence\nmay be expected by the year 2030.\nPutting all the three factors together, the potential rise in sea level in the Pearl\nRiver delta is 29.3 \u00b1 2.3 cm by the year 2030 as shown in Table 2. Therefore, we\nassume a 30 cm rise in sea level for the subsequent analysis.\n5. The Interaction between Sea-level Rise and Freshwater Discharge\nIn order to assess the impacts of sea-level rise during flood seasons (excluding\ntyphoon storm conditions), this study simulates the interaction between a 30 cm\nrise in sea level and a number of flood conditions. Due to the estuarine back-\nwater effects, there will be an increase of water level within the delta area, and\nthe increase may vary spatially across the delta plain. Therefore, the assessment\nis performed for the 54 tide gauge locations across the delta plain, based on the\nassumption of a 30 cm rise in mean sea level at San-zao and under five different\nflood scenarios (Table 3), using Equations (3) and (4). The additional increases of\nwater level due to the estuarine backwater effects are calculated by subtracting the\nobserved water level from the projected water level, as shown in Figure 4. The\narea associated with an additional increase of 5 cm or less in water level is viewed\nas less affected. The area related to an additional increase of 25 cm or higher in\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.8\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 9\nFigure 5.

The area between these two values\nis heavily affected.\nThe estuarine backwater effects are first estimated under the lowest freshwa-\nter discharge scenario (dry-season freshwater discharge, 2000 m3\/s) to provide a\nbaseline estimate of the impacts. This calculation uses the following equation,\nZI = C1Z1 + \u03b2Q + \u03b1Z1Q + C2.

(4)\nThe impacts are calculated, based on a scenario of a 30 cm rise in sea level\nat the mouth of the estuary. The results show that the additional increase in water\nlevel due to the 30 cm rise in sea level appears to be 30 cm to 35 cm at the outlets\nof the delta and 25 cm to 30 cm in a large part of the delta plain (Figure 6). The\nmagnitude of additional water level decreases towards the northwest apex of the\ndelta.\nUnder the small floodwater scenario as observed in September 1993, the\nseverely affected area is confined to the areas around the head of the estuary and the\nsouthern part of the delta plain (Figure 7-I). The area around the northwest apex\nis less affected because of the increased river gradient. The medium flood scen-\nario represents the flood conditions equivalent to a 1-in-5 year event. Under this\nscenario, the low-lying areas along the shoreline are severely affected (Figure 7-\nII), with large parts of the delta plain heavily or less affected. If the floodwater\ndischarge increases as equivalent to a 1-in-20 year event, the less affected area\nexpands significantly southwards (Figure 7-III). Finally, under the severe flood\nscenario as observed in June 1994, equivalent to a 1-in-100 year event, only the\nnarrow strip along the shoreline is affected severely (Figure 7-IV). In order words,\nduring severe flood seasons, the delta plain is heavily influenced by floodwater\ndischarges. During dry seasons, the projected rise in sea level will have much\ngreater impact on the delta plain.\nAccording to the above simulations, the delta plain can be divided into three\nzones, namely A (less affected), B (heavily affected) and C (severely affected)\n(Figure 8). The average maximum net increases in water level are summarised in\nTable 4. It is noted that the 30 cm rise in sea level will have very little impact\nin zone A. Therefore, the threat to zone A mainly comes from river floods. The\nimpacts of future sea-level rises in zones B and C are significant. As zone C is\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.10\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 11\nFigure 6.

Using Equation (4), the amount of increase in water level due\nto a 30 cm rise in sea level is also calculated for the 17 locations (Table 5). It is clear\nthat there will be almost no impact on the return periods for locations within zone\nA. The increase in flood level in zone B may only shorten the return periods a little.\nHowever, there are significant changes for zone C. Consequently, the rise in water\nlevel will no doubt shorten the return periods significantly in zone C (Table 6). In\nturn, this will pose a serious challenge to flood defence management.\nWithin the delta plain, there are flood defences (or sea walls) of 3057.6 km in\nlength, protecting 368,500 ha of agricultural land and 6.68 million people.

As\ndiscussed in a previous section, the impacts to zone A are minimal. Consideration\nshould therefore be taken for zones B and C where the total length of flood defence\nis 2608.6 km.\nThe criteria for flood defence design were set by the provincial government in\n1955 for the first time. There were two significant revisions in 1963 and 1995. Ac-\ncording to the 1995 design criteria, flood defence was divided into two categories:\nriver flood defence and tidal flood defence, with tidal flood defence being further\ndivided into five classes (Table 7).\nAt present, the majority of tidal flood defence in the delta plain is within class\n4 and class 5. There are 116 class-4 defences in the delta plain, and 95 of them lie\nwithin zones B and C with a total length of 2608.6 km. About 43% of the defences\nin these two zones (c. 1126.1 km) are below standard even at present. In other\nwords, improvements to these flood defences are needed urgently.\nAccording to the projected rise in sea level (Table 5), this study has calculated\nthe amount of engineering work needed to meet the design standard for each of\nthe 95 defences. To raise the standard to meet the 30 cm rise in sea level, the\ntotal engineering work will amount to 17.5 million m3 of soil and stone. Based\non the 1998 price, the total investment will amount 2103 million Chinese Yuan\n(equivalent to 262.9 million USD). Although seemingly a huge investment, this\namount is comparable with the direct economic loss of 2218 million Chinese Yuan\ninflicted by the 1994 flood in the Pearl River delta region.\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.15\n16 ZHENGUO HUANG ET AL.\nTable VII.

Conclusion\nThe Pearl River delta is one of the areas in China where rapid economic growth\nis taking place. Recently, this area has attracted inward migration of population,\nmaking it one of the most densely populated areas in China. The potential rise in\nsea level during the 21st century will pose a severe threat to the communities in\nthe deltaic area. In order for the current and future investments and communities to\nbe protected from potential threat of marine inundation, preventive policies need\nto be formulated and implemented as soon as possible. For these policies to be\nformulated correctly, scientific research is needed to provide accurate estimates of\nthe magnitude of additional increase in water level due to the rise in sea level.\nThis study considers global (eustatic) and local (estuarine effects and geological\nsubsidence) factors, and calculates the rate of sea-level rise in the 72 years since\n1920. These analyses predict that, by 2030, a rise in relative sea level will be\npossibly close to 30 cm at the mouth of the Pearl River estuary. This finding forms\nthe basis for subsequent analyses.\nUsing the tidal records from the 54 tide gauges, return periods of water level\nacross the delta plain are calculated against five known flood events raging from\nsituations in dry seasons to a severe flood recorded in 1994. Further calculations\nare carried out to assess the impacts of a 30 cm rise in sea level. Results show that,\ndue to estuarine backwater effects, the impacts lessen towards the apex of the delta\nnhaz1568.tex; 17\/12\/2003; 12:48; p.16\nCOASTAL INUNDATION DUE TO SEA LEVEL RISE 17\nplain, and the low-lying areas adjacent to the estuary are affected most. Summing\nup the possible impacts of a 30 cm rise in sea level under the five flood scenarios,\nthree zones are identified, namely Zone A (least affected), Zone B (heavily af-\nfected) and Zone C (severely affected). The impacts are of rising water level which\ncan be translated into the shortening of flood return periods.\nAccording to the results, large areas will be affected heavily and severely.\nAdding to this is the fact that a large number of existing tidal flood defences are be-\nlow the standard set by the provincial government. Thus, the projected 30 cm rise in\nsea level by 2030 will no doubt pose a serious challenge to the local authorities who\nare responsible for flood prevention and who provide protection for economic and\nindustrial developments. Based on current construction prices, a large investment\nto improve the defences is needed urgently.\nThe current study focuses only on the potential threat of tidal inundation un-\nder the scenario of a 30 cm rise in sea level by 2030 and five known freshwater\ndischarge scenarios raging dry seasons to severe floods. Coastal flood hazards due\nto wave actions and storm conditions have not been considered. Due to the micro-\ntide conditions in the Pearl River delta, typhoon storm induced water level rise and\nwave actions both require further investigation. Indeed, information on the impacts\nof water level changes due to both secular rise in sea level and short-term storm\nconditions are needed to help local governments correctly formulate their policies.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research is supported partly by a research grant from Guangdong Province,\nChina (No. 930816).
