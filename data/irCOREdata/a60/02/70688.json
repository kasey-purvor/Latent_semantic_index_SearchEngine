Endorsement \nrates indicated increased belief-bias on complex problems, a finding that runs counter \nto the \u201cbelief-first\u201d selective scrutiny model, but which is consistent with other \ntheories, including \u201creasoning first\u201d and \u201cparallel-process\u201d models. Inspection-time \ndata revealed a number of effects that, again, arbitrated against the selective scrutiny \nmodel. The most striking inspection-time result was an interaction between logic and \nbelief on premise processing times, whereby belief-logic conflict problems promoted \nincreased latencies relative to non-conflict problems. This finding challenges belief-\nfirst and reasoning-first models, but is directly predicted by parallel-process models, \nwhich assume that the outputs of simultaneous heuristic and analytic processing \nstreams lead to an awareness of belief-logic conflicts than then require time-\nconsuming resolution. \n  \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n3 \nBelief-Logic Conflict Resolution in Syllogistic Reasoning: Inspection-Time Evidence \nfor a Parallel-Process Model \n Belief bias in reasoning is a non-logical tendency to accept conclusions that \nare compatible with beliefs more frequently than conclusions that contradict beliefs. \nThe bias is more pronounced on invalid than valid problems, giving rise to a logic by \nbelief interaction in conclusion-endorsement rates that has been studied extensively \nsince it was established by Evans, Barston, and Pollard (1983). Contemporary \ntheories of belief bias are couched within a dual-process framework (e.g., Evans, \n2006; Stanovich, 2004) which characterises the phenomenon as arising from the \ninterplay between belief-based \u201cheuristic\u201d processes that are rapid, associative and \nimplicit, and logic-based \u201canalytic\u201d processes that are slow, sequential, explicit, and \nconstrained by working memory limitations. The belief-bias effect suggests that \nheuristic processes may often dominate over analytic processes in cueing responses. \n Dual-process theories of belief bias have gained support from a wide range of \nsources, including: neuroimaging studies demonstrating the neurological \ndifferentiation of logic-based and belief-based responding (Goel & Dolan, 2003); \nresearch indicating how resolving belief-logic conflicts in favour of logic declines \nwith age (Gilinsky & Judd, 1994); and studies demonstrating how people high in \ngeneral intelligence are better able to resist belief bias (Stanovich & West, 1997). \nDespite the support for a general dual-process view of belief bias, however, little \nconsensus exists as to which specific dual-process theory of belief bias is best able to \ncapture the full range of available data. Indeed, all current theories gain some support, \nyet differ markedly in their assumptions about the sequencing of heuristic and \nanalytic operations. \nThe primary goal of the present research was to realise a syllogism-\n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n4 \ncomplexity manipulation so as to examine predictions deriving from three distinct \nclasses of belief-bias theory that we refer to as \u201cbelief-first\u201d, \u201creasoning-first\u201d and \n\u201cparallel-process\u201d models (we are grateful to Jonathan Evans, personal \ncommunication, for this characterisation of theories). Our research was also \nmotivated by a secondary goal, which was to employ an inspection-time measure of \nprocessing to clarify how heuristic and analytic processes compete to determine \nresponding. To this end, we developed a computer-based, mouse-contingent display \ntechnique to monitor problem inspection-times for syllogism components (cf.  \nRoberts & Newton, 2001; Schroyens, Schaeken, Fias, & d'Ydewalle, 2000)1. \nWe know of two previous belief-bias studies that involved response-time \nmeasures (i.e., Ball, Phillips, Wade, & Quayle, 2006; Thompson, Striemer, Reikoff, \nGunter, & Campbell\u2019s, 2003). These studies revealed some inconsistencies in \nobserved effects, although they converged in showing that people spend more time \nprocessing syllogisms with believable conclusions. Both studies, however, had \nlimitations that the present research aimed to overcome. In Ball et al.\u2019s (2006) \nexperiment conclusion validity was confounded with premise configuration such that \nvalid conclusions were always presented with \u201cSome A are B; No B are C\u201d premises, \nwhilst invalid conclusions were always presented with \u201cNo A are B, Some B are C\u201d \npremises. Thompson et al.\u2019s experiment involved a latency measure that simply \nrecorded the overall time to evaluate conclusions. This rather coarse measure may \nhave obscured more subtle chronometric evidence that might emerge from a finer-\ngrained examination of the locus of processing effort on premise and conclusion \ncomponents. Moreover, Thompson et al. failed to examine latency data for violations \nof normality, yet such violations are common in chronometric data and can impact \nseverely on test validity (Ball, Lucas, Miles, & Gale, 2003). \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n5 \nBelief-First Models \nBelief-first theories come in two distinct flavours, referred to by Evans (in \npress) as pre-emptive conflict resolution and default-interventionist models. An \nexample of the former is the selective scrutiny model (Evans et al., 1983). This \nassumes that believable conclusions are responded to heuristically (and simply \naccepted), whereas unbelievable conclusions motivate more rigorous analytic \nprocessing directed at testing conclusion validity. Evans and Pollard (1990) found \nsupport for the selective scrutiny model by demonstrating how a complexity \nmanipulation affected discrimination of true from false conclusions, but not the \nmagnitude of the belief-bias effect. This makes sense under the selective scrutiny \nmodel (Evans, Newstead, & Byrne, 1993), since belief is processed first, followed by \nan attempt at logical analysis; if analytic processing fails (more likely with complex \nproblems) then random errors will ensue. \nEvans and Pollard\u2019s (1990) apparent failure to find increased belief bias with \ncomplex problems has, however, been questioned by Klauer, Musch, and Naumer \n(2000), who note that the decreased variance observed in responses to such problems \nactually suggests that \u201cthe relative impact of belief was larger in the groups with \ncomplex problems\u201d (Klauer et al., 2000, p. 856, emphasis added). This proposal \nunderlines the need for further research exploring how complexity influences belief \nbias. It is also important to consider what the selective scrutiny model might predict \nconcerning inspection times. Presumably, the premises of unbelievable conclusions \nshould be inspected for longer, since reasoners are more likely to engage in analytic \nprocessing for these than believable ones (Evans, 2007). Such increased processing of \nunbelievable syllogisms should arise irrespective of problem complexity.  \nDefault-interventionist models also assume an early influence of beliefs, \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n6 \nviewing heuristically-cued \u201cdefault\u201d responses as being either supported or inhibited \nby subsequent analytic processing. For example, the selective processing model \n(Evans, 2000, 2007; Evans, Handley, & Harper, 2001), proposes that the default \nheuristic response is to accept believable and reject unbelievable conclusions, which \nexplains why belief-bias arises on both valid and invalid problems. If analytic \nprocesses intervene, however, then it is assumed that such processes will try to \nconstruct only a single mental model of the premises. But this analytic component of \nreasoning is itself biased by conclusion believability, such that a search is initiated for \na confirming model when the conclusion is believable and for a falsifying model \nwhen the conclusion is unbelievable (cf. Klauer et al., 2000). These assumptions \nreadily explain the increased belief-bias seen on invalid syllogisms since both \nconfirming and falsifying models exist. \nThe selective processing model also explains the increased belief bias and \ndecreased logical performance that was predicted and observed under speeded-\nresponse instructions by Evans and Curtis-Holmes (2005), since these effects would \nbe a natural consequence of elevations in default, heuristic responding. Presumably, \ntoo, any effect of problem complexity on the magnitude of belief bias would likewise \narise through increased recourse to default responding and diminished analytic \nintervention (i.e., there should be an increase in belief-bias and a decrease in logic-\nbased responding). As for inspection-time predictions, the selective-processing model \ndiffers from the selective scrutiny model and does not predict that people will take \nlonger to process unbelievable conclusions, since analytic intervention is just as likely \nfor believable as unbelievable conclusions (Evans, 2007). \nReasoning-First Models \nReasoning-first models of belief bias propose that people strive to reason \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n7 \nanalytically, only falling back on heuristic responding when analytic processing fails. \nSuch accounts have been referred to as computational escape hatch models (Ball & \nQuayle, 2000; Stanovich & West, 2000). A recent example is Quayle and Ball\u2019s \n(2000) metacognitive uncertainty theory, which is closely allied to the misinterpreted \nnecessity model proposed by Evans et al. (1983). Both accounts emphasise \nuncertainty as a determinant of belief-bias, with people producing a belief-based \nresponse when a conclusion is possible but not necessitated by the premises (i.e., \nwhen conclusions are indeterminate). The difference between the metacognitive \nuncertainty theory and the misinterpreted necessity model resides primarily in the \nweight that the former places on limited working-memory capacity as a cause of \nuncertainty.  \nIn terms of conclusion-acceptance rates, these reasoning-first theories predict \nthat problem complexity should increase belief-bias (e.g., by further increasing \nuncertainty) and decrease logical responding. As for inspection times, reasoning-first \nmodels would predict more rapid responding with valid conclusions irrespective of \nproblem complexity, since reasoners should generally be more confident with valid \nthan invalid syllogisms. \nParallel-Process Models \n A third way in which heuristic and analytic reasoning processes may operate \nis as parallel processing streams. The best example of such a model is arguably \nSloman\u2019s (1996, 2002) theory, which posits parallel \u201cassociative\u201d (heuristic) and \n\u201crule-based\u201d (analytic) systems. Sloman proposes that both systems will usually try to \ngenerate a response, and that the rule-based system has some capacity to suppress the \nassociative system, although the associative system always \u201chas its opinion heard\u201d \nand can defuse a rule-based response. This model would lead to response conflicts \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n8 \nwhenever belief-based (associative) and logical (rule-based) processes cue different \noutputs. These conflicts, moreover, would need to be resolved, perhaps according to \nsome mechanism favouring logic with a certain probability (see Evans, in press, for a \nmathematical instantiation of such a mechanism that captures standard belief-bias \neffects). Within a parallel-process model, problem complexity would presumably \nshift the balance of responding toward beliefs and away from logic since the analytic \nprocessing stream would have difficulty in delivering an output.  \n Inspection-time predictions for parallel-process models of belief bias are \nunique, since people should be \u201caware\u201d of the conflict between belief-based and \nlogic-based responses cued by the two systems (we are grateful to Jonathan Evans, \npersonal communication, for alerting us to this). Such conflict awareness would arise \nfor valid-unbelievable and invalid-believable syllogisms, and the need for conflict \nresolution should lead to increased processing times for these problems relative to \nthose where belief and logic deliver equivalent responses (valid-believable and \ninvalid-unbelievable syllogisms).  \nMethod \nParticipants \n Forty-eight undergraduates aged between 18 and 55 from the University of \nDerby received course credit for participation. None had received prior instruction \nconcerning the psychology of reasoning. All were tested individually. \nDesign \n A 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 repeated-measures design was used that manipulated figural \ncomplexity (AB-BC vs. BA-CB), mood (IEO vs. EIO), logic (valid vs. invalid \nconclusions) and belief (believable vs. unbelievable conclusions). To control for \nbiases linked to preferred conclusion orders (A-C or C-A), problems were collapsed \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n9 \nacross mood in all analyses. The use of the BA-CB figure to produce complex \nproblems was based on evidence that people find this figure harder to process because \ndemanding mental operations are required to ensure that middle terms of premises are \nrepresented contiguously (Espino, Santamar\u00eda, & Garc\u00eca-Madruga, 2000, Johnson-\nLaird & Bara, 1984; Stupple & Ball, 2005, 2007). Dependent measures were \nconclusion-acceptance rates and inspection times for premises and conclusions. \nMaterials and Procedure \n Participants received 16 target syllogisms (eight AB-BC; eight BA-CB) in \nIEO and EIO moods, preceded by four practice syllogisms in AEA, III, IAI and AEE \nmoods. Belief-oriented contents drew on those employed by Quayle and Ball (2000). \nUnbelievable conclusions were definitionally false (e.g., Some cats are not animals), \nand believable conclusions were definitionally true (e.g., Some animals are not cats). \nInvalid conclusions were indeterminate (consistent with premises but not necessitated \nby them). For each figure there were equal numbers of valid and invalid problems and \nbelievable and unbelievable conclusions. Presentation order of target syllogisms was \ncounterbalanced using a balanced Latin square design, with thematic contents \nsystematically rotated through the 16 problems.  \nAuthorware 5.1 on a PC was used to present problems and standard \ninstructions (cf. Ball et al., 2006) and to record responses and inspection times for \nproblem regions. Participants were informed that for each problem there would be \nmasked statements labelled \u201cPremise 1\u201d, \u201cPremise 2\u201d and \u201cConclusion\u201d, and that a \nsingle click of the mouse on masked areas would reveal the underlying statement until \nthe mouse was moved from that area. Participants could revisit masked areas as often \nas they wished before registering a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d decision as to the conclusion\u2019s \nnecessity.  \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n10 \nResults and Discussion \nConclusion Acceptance Rates \n Conclusion acceptance data (Table 1) were subjected to a three-way analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA). \nMain Effects. The analysis revealed standard effects of logic, F(1, 47) = 47.32, \nMSE = 0.14, p < .001, with more valid conclusions accepted than invalid, and belief \nF(1, 47) = 34.42, MSE = 0.19, p < .001, with more believable conclusions accepted than \nunbelievable. The effect of figure was unreliable, F(1, 47) = 2.88, MSE = 0.10, p = \n.096, though in the direction of more conclusion acceptances in the easier AB-BC \nfigure.  \n(Table 1 about here) \n Two-Way Interactions. A typical logic by belief interaction was evident, F(1, \n47) = 9.15, MSE = 0.10, p = .004. In addition, belief bias increased in the BA-CB \nfigure, as revealed by a significant belief by figure interaction, F(1, 47) = 6.17, MSE = \n0.06, p = .017. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests pinpointed the source of this interaction to a \ndifference in acceptance rates for unbelievable conclusions across the figures (p = .002). \nThis increased belief bias in the harder figure corresponds to the predictions of most \ntheories, which assume that complexity will amplify cognitive load, thereby inducing \nmore heuristic responding. The one theory that does not make this prediction is the \nselective scrutiny model.  \nThe selective scrutiny model also predicts a decrease in the effect of logic for \nthe harder figure - as do the other theories described earlier - yet no logic by figure \ninteraction was observed, F(1, 47) = 2.86, MSE = .08, p = .10. This failed prediction of \nextant theories may call into question the efficacy of our complexity manipulation, and \nwe concur that a degree of caution is needed in interpreting our acceptance data. Still, \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n11 \nthe increase in belief bias for the BA-CB figure seems readily interpretable as a \ncomplexity effect, and we wonder if the lack of a logic effect is an artefact of the \ngenerally reduced tendency to endorse conclusions in the BA-CB figure (except in the \nbelievable-valid condition).  \nHigher-Order Interactions. In terms of higher-order effects, a significant three-\nway interaction between logic, belief and figure was observed, F(1, 47) = 5.40, MSE = \n.06, p = .025. As can be seen from Table 1, the typical logic by belief interaction that is \nevident for the AB-BC figure is eliminated for the BA-CB figure. People evidently \nrespond in a belief-biased manner to both valid and invalid conclusions in the harder \nfigure, whereas belief bias only dominates responses to invalid problems in the easier \nfigure, as is traditionally observed. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests confirmed this \ninterpretation by revealing that: (1) more valid-unbelievable conclusions were rejected \nwith the BA-CB than the AB-BC figure (p = .013); (2) more invalid-unbelievable \nconclusions were rejected with BA-CB than AB-BC (p = .049); and (3) more valid-\nbelievable conclusions were accepted with BA-CB than the AB-BC (p = .033).  \nTotal Premise Inspection Times \nTotal premise inspection times were subjected to a three-way ANOVA. Since \ndata were positively skewed a logarithmic transformation was conducted to normalise \nthe scores. Figure 1 shows premise inspection times for each condition in the form of \ntransformed data converted back into natural units (seconds). \n(Figure 1 about here) \nThe analysis revealed no influence of figure on premise inspection times, \neither as a main effect, F(1, 47) = 0.06, MSE = 0.04, p =.81, or in interaction with \nother factors. Existing belief-bias theories do not lend themselves to clear-cut \npredictions concerning the effect of figure on premise inspection times. Indeed, whilst \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n12 \nfigural complexity might be expected to increase the processing of premises, such an \neffect might well be mitigated by increased belief-based responding, which could \ncurtail processing time. On balance, then, one might expect little direct impact of \nfigural complexity on premise processing times, as was observed. \nThe analysis indicated no main effect of belief on premise inspection times, \nF(1, 47) = 0.38, MSE = 0.04, p = .54. This lack of a belief effect goes against the \npredictions of the belief-first selective scrutiny model, which assumes more premise \nprocessing for unbelievable than believable conclusions, since only unbelievable \nconclusions will receive analytic examination. Our failure to find a main effect of \nbelief also runs counter to Thompson et al.\u2019s (2003) study, where latency data \nindicated that people were actually spending more time processing syllogisms with \nbelievable conclusions than unbelievable ones (i.e., the opposite of what would be \nexpected according to the selective scrutiny model). We recognise, however, that the \nabsence of any form of belief effect in our analysis cannot be taken as strong evidence \nagainst extant theories because of possible concerns with statistical test power. For the \nsame reason, we are cautious about interpreting this null effect as evidence supporting \nmodels that do not predict an influence of belief on premise inspection times.  \nThe ANOVA, however, did reveal a reliable effect of logic, F(1, 47) = 5.90, \nMSE = 0.04, p = .02, with increased premise inspection times for invalid problems \nover valid ones. Only the reasoning-first theories predict this effect. Crucially, \nhowever, the main effect of logic was qualified by the presence of a reliable logic by \nbelief interaction, F(1, 47) = 9.74, MSE = 0.03, p = .003, with the premises of conflict \nproblems (valid-unbelievable and invalid-unbelievable ones) being inspected \nsubstantially longer than the premises of non-conflict problems. Post-hoc Bonferroni \ntests indicated that: valid-unbelievable premises were inspected longer than valid-\n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n13 \nbelievable premises (p = .027); invalid-believable premises were inspected longer \nthan invalid-unbelievable premises, although this difference was not reliable (p = .12); \nand invalid-believable premises were inspected longer than valid-believable premises \n(p = .001).  Only one belief-bias theory places a strong emphasis on the critical role of \nsuch conflict problems: Sloman\u2019s (e.g., 2002) parallel-process model.  \nConclusion Inspection Analysis  \n We also conducted a three-way ANOVA to examine inspection-time effects \narising during conclusion processing. Data were skewed, and distribution problems \nwere again normalized using a logarithmic transformation. The analysis revealed a \nreliable effect of figural complexity, with BA-CB conclusions scrutinised for longer \nthan the AB-BC ones, F(1, 47) = 4.53, MSE = .02, p = .039. This effect provides \nanother strong hint that our complexity manipulation was successful in increasing the \ncognitive load associated with processing BA-CB problems. There was also a reliable \neffect of logic, F(1, 47) = 12.70, MSE = .02, p = .001, with invalid conclusions being \nscrutinised for longer than valid ones. There was no belief effect, F(1, 47) = 0.24, MSE \n= 0.06, p = .878, and no interaction effects approached significance.  \nThe main effect of logic across both figures seems to be most readily explicable \nin terms of reasoning-first theories, since people are predicted to engage in increased \nprocessing for invalid problems. We note, however, that if the parallel-process account \nwas augmented with an assumption that invalid problems are more difficult to reason \nthrough than valid ones, then it could accommodate the observation of a logic effect on \nboth conclusion processing and premise processing, whilst also dealing with the striking \neffect of increased processing times on the premises of conflict problems.  \n(Figure 2 about here) \n \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n14 \nGeneral Discussion \nContemporary belief-bias accounts are framed as dual-process theories, whereby \nconclusion-endorsement decisions arise from the interplay between pre-attentive \nheuristic processes and conscious analytic processes (Evans, 2006, Stanovich, 2004). \nGiven this dual-process characterisation of belief bias, our research had two objectives. \nFirst, we wanted to use a figural complexity manipulation to examine the predictions of \nthree classes of dual-process theory that we have referred to as belief-first, reasoning-\nfirst, and parallel-process models. Second, we wished to monitor inspection-times for \nsyllogism components to clarify how heuristic and analytic processes drive responding.  \nWe note that there have been recent calls for the enrichment of belief-bias data through \nthe addition of process-tracing and chronometric measures (e.g., Klauer et al., 2000), \nyet little research has taken up this challenge. Moreover, the two published studies that \nhave monitored latencies in a belief-bias paradigm (Ball et al., 2005; Thompson et al., \n2003) have limitations that render their findings inconclusive. Our experiment \nattempted to improve on previous research, for example, by employing carefully \ncontrolled syllogisms and fine-grained process monitoring. \nTurning to our findings, conclusion-endorsement data revealed significantly \nincreased belief bias on the harder figure as well as reduced logic by belief interaction. \nThere was, however, no evidence for decreased logical responding on this harder figure. \nThis pattern of findings runs counter to the selective scrutiny model \u2013 a belief-first \nmodel \u2013 since problem complexity should result in additional random error rather than \nrecourse to belief-based responding (Evans & Pollard, 1990). This model would, \ntherefore, predict decreased logical decisions with complex problems but no increased \nbelief-bias (in direct opposition to our actual findings). \nThe pattern of data is, however, broadly consistent with most other models of \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n15 \nbelief bias, which concur in predicting an increase in belief-based responding for more \ndemanding problems given that task complexity should undermine the effectiveness of \nanalytic processing, thereby allowing belief-based decisions to take precedence. The \nattenuation in the logic by belief interaction with the harder problems also makes \nperfect sense for these models, since the influence of belief on both valid and invalid \nproblems would be at its greatest with the demanding figure. The support for these \nmodels from endorsement data, however, is not incontrovertible, since they also predict \ndecreased logical responding in the harder figure, which was not apparent. We have \nsuggested that the lack of a logic effect is an artefact of the generally reduced tendency \nto endorse conclusions in the BA-CB figure; this may itself reflect a lack of confidence \nin responding that could be a by-product of problem difficulty (Quayle & Ball, 2000).  \nIn the case of inspection-time findings, there was no evidence for figural \ninfluences on inspection times for premises, although a reliable effect emerged in \nrelation to conclusions. This latter result provides some support for the efficacy of our \nfigural manipulation in inducing increased processing difficulties, although it is unclear \nwhy such an effect should be localised to conclusions rather than distributed across both \npremise and conclusion components. One possibility is that increased uncertainty \ninduced by problem complexity leads to greater recourse to conclusion-centred \nreasoning (cf. Stupple & Ball, 2007).  \nWe found little effect of conclusion believability on premise or conclusion \ninspection-times. Although this finding concurs with reasoning-first and parallel-\nprocess models \u2013 and contradicts belief-first models \u2013 we are cautious about over-\ninterpreting a null effect as evidence for or against extant theories of belief bias. More \nimpressive evidence, however, comes from our observation of reliable increases in the \ninspection times for the premises and the conclusions of invalid problems relative to \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n16 \nvalid ones, as per the reasoning-first theories, which assume greater levels of \nuncertainty with invalid problems given that conclusions are possible but not \nnecessitated (Quayle & Ball, 2000; Thompson et al., 2003). This logic effect on \nprocessing time is contrary to the belief-first models and seems difficult to reconcile \nwith them given their emphasis on conclusion believability as driving analytic \nprocessing. The logic effect, however, whilst also not predicted by the parallel-process \nmodel, is readily reconcilable with this theory if it is assumed that invalid problems \nrequire more analytic processing than valid ones (see Quayle & Ball, 2000, for \nsupporting evidence). We also note that the parallel-process model assumes that the \ndecision system that reconciles the outputs from the heuristic and analytic processing \nstreams effectively waits for the results of both processing streams before producing a \nresponse (see Evans, in press, for a relevant discussion). Without this assumption the \nheuristic system would typically win out because of its processing speed, which would \nproduce exclusively biased performance. \nArguably our most striking inspection-time finding is the reliable interaction \nbetween logic and belief on premise processing, which indicates that conflict problems \nwhere logic and belief collide lead to increased processing latencies relative to non-\nconflict problems, a result that replicates the trend identified by Ball et al. (2006). The \none theory that places a central emphasis on the reconciliation of heuristic-analytic \nconflicts in reasoning is Sloman\u2019s (e.g., 2002) parallel-process model. Given the \ncompatibility of this model with the majority of our findings we feel that it may well be \nthe strongest contender for a comprehensive account of our data. An additional strength \nof the model is its apparent parsimony. Other models require a considerable number of \nassumptions to accommodate conclusion-endorsement findings, yet such accounts still \nappear to struggle to interpret latency-based data. As a general dual-process theory of \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n17 \nreasoning, the parallel-process model certainly deserves further in-depth analysis across \na range of reasoning paradigms to assess its generality.  \nPerhaps the most important upshot of our study is the indication that whilst \nmany dual-process theories are able to provide plausible accounts of acceptance-rate \ndata (as they were in the present case), these theories seem to falter when it comes to \naccounting for chronometric evidence. As such, we suggest that our study underscores \nthe value of going beyond conclusion-acceptance measures as a way to progress the \nadvancement of dual-process theories in the reasoning domain. \n \n     Belief-Logic Conflict Resolution \n \n18 \nReferences \nBall, L.
