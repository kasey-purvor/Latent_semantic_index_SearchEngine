The results obtained by24\nthese two methods, with the assumption of non-correlation between the horizontal and vertical forces, were25\nalmost identical. However, the FORM method was faster and simpler, compared to the MCS technique.26\nFurthermore, the correlation between the horizontal and vertical forces has no significant effect on the failure27\nprobability, regardless of the correlation strength. Therefore, it is concluded that the FORM method can be28\nused to estimate the failure probability without considering the correlation between horizontal and vertical29\nforces.30\nKeywords: soil engineering properties; tillage forces; failure probability; chisel plough.31\n1. Introduction32\nAccurate prediction of the forces of tillage implements is of great value to both implement designers and33\nfarmers (Desbiolles et al., 1997). There are many available soil cutting models that can be used to predict the34\nforces acting on a tillage tool (Zhang and Kushwaha, 1995). Analytical and numerical modeling methods are35\ndifferently used approaches to achieve this goal. In the analytical methods, soil-tool forces are considered as36\nfunctions of three categories of variables, namely soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and37\noperational conditions. Soil engineering properties are conventionally considered to be constant, reflecting a38\nhomogeneous soil profile, and tillage forces are calculated for assigned tool design parameters and39\noperational conditions (Godwin, 2007; Godwin and O'Dogherty, 2007; Godwin et al., 2007). When40\nnumerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), are adopted to model the soil-tillage tool41\ninteraction, two different theoretical approaches can be introduced, namely, the curve-fitting technique and42\nthe elastic-perfectly plastic assumption (Mouazen and Nem\u00e9nyi, 1998). The elastic-perfectly plastic method43\nconsiders Young's modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio as constants, while the curve-fitting method only44\naccounts for a variable Young\u2019s modulus as a function of load history (Chi and Kushwaha, 1991). For both of45\nthese FEM methods, the soil is treated as a homogeneous body during the FEM analysis, with very few46\nexceptions. Mouazen and Nem\u00e9nyi (1999) developed a three-dimensional FEM model for cutting non-47\nhomogeneous (vertically) sandy loam soil by a subsoiler. The non-homogeneity in the soil was proposed to48\nsimulate the differences in soil strength among different soil layers. However, they considered Young's49\nmodulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio as constant in the FEM analysis. Moreover, Fielke (1999) studied50\nthe effect of a variable Poisson's ratio on tillage forces and soil movement around the cutting edge. Recently,51\nthe discrete element method (DEM) has been used to model the interactions between the soil and52\ntillage tools. This method is based on a promising approach for constructing a high-fidelity model53\nto describe the soil-tillage tool interaction (Shmulevich, 2010). However, the determination of54\nmodel parameters to control the soil void ratio and the shape of particles, as well as, the modeling55\nof breakage and the formation of agglomerates are still of great challenges and limit the DEM56\napplication for practical engineering problems.57\nIn reality, soil is neither a continuous nor a homogeneous mass, but a three-phase medium consisting of solid,58\nliquid and gaseous particles (Klenin et al., 1985; McKyes, 1989). Consequently, soil engineering properties59\nare variable in both vertical and horizontal directions (Kai et al., 2007). Estimating tillage forces using60\nanalytical or numerical methods with the assumption that soil engineering properties are constant does not61\nreflect the nature of soil. Therefore, a new approach is needed for quantifying the variability of tillage forces62\ndue to variability of tillage system parameters that is associated with probability of soil failure.63\n64\nThis study aims to overcome the drawbacks of classical design approaches, by explicitly taking into account65\nthe variability of design variables, and to calculate the failure probability for passive tillage tools. The66\nobjectives of this work are to: 1) propose a method for accurate modeling the variability of soil engineering67\nproperties (soil weight density, cohesion, internal friction angle, soil-tool friction angle and soil-tool68\nadhesion), 2) develop a simple method for determining the dispersion effects of soil engineering properties,69\ntool design parameters (tool width and rake angle) and operational conditions (tool working depth, surcharge70\npressure and tool speed) on tillage forces, 3) propose a methodology for quantifying the variability of tillage71\nforces and 4) estimate the failure probability using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique and the72\nfirst-order reliability method (FORM).73\n74\n3. Materials and methods75\n3.1 Estimating tillage forces76\nMcKyes and Ali\u2019s model (1977) was used to estimate the forces acting on a tillage tool. We selected this77\nmodel because it is simple and accurate (Zhang and Kushwaha 1995), and has shown good agreement with78\nexperimental results, especially at low speeds (Grisso and Perumpral, 1985). For improving the estimation of79\ntillage forces, the effects of soil-tool adhesion (McKyes, 1985) and tool speed (Onwualu and Watts, 1998)80\nwere taken into account. The total force can be written according to the general earth pressure model as:81\n\u0732 \u0d4c \u0d6b\u0740\u07db \u0b36\u0730\u0c0a \u0d45 \u0003\u073f\u0740\u0730\u0bd6\u0d45 \u0bd4\u073f\u0740\u0730\u0bd6\u0bd4 \u0d45 \u0003\u0740\u074d \u0730\u0be4 \u0d45 \u0003\u07db\u0752\n\u0b36\u0740\u0730\u0bd4\u0d6f\u0753\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0373\u123b\nwhere\u0003\u0732 \u0003is the total force in kN, \u07db\u0003is the soil specific weight in kN. m\u0b3f\u0b37, \u0740 is the tool working depth in m, \u0730\u0c0a82\nis the gravity coefficient (dimensionless), \u073f is the soil cohesion in kPa, \u0730\u0bd6 is the cohesion coefficient83\n(dimensionless), \u0bd4\u073f is the soil-tool adhesion in kPa,\u0003\u0730 \u0bd6\u0bd4 is the adhesion coefficient (dimensionless), \u074d is the84\nsurface surcharge pressure in kPa, \u0730\u0be4 is the surcharge pressure coefficient (dimensionless), \u0752\u0003is the tool85\nspeed in m. s\u0b3f\u0b35, \u0730\u0bd4 is the inertial coefficient (dimensionless) and \u0753 is the tool width in m.86\nDimensionless coefficients \u123a\u0730 \u0c0a\u01e1\u0730 \u0bd6\u01e1\u0730 \u0bd6\u0bd4\u01e1\u0730 \u0be4\u01e1\u0730 \u0bd4) can be determined with respect to the soil failure pattern87\nproposed by McKyes and Ali (1979), and a simplified form of the total force can be given by Equation (2):88\n\u0732 \u0d4c \u1248\n12\u07db\u074e\u0d6c\u0373\u0d45 \u0374\u074f\u0375\u0753\u0d70\u0d45 \u073f\u1240\u0373\u0d45 \u074f\u0753\u1241 cos(\u07f6)sin(\u07da\u0be5) sin(\u07da\u0be5 \u0d45 \u07f6) \u0d46 \u0bd4\u073f cos(\u07d9\u0d45 \u07da\u0be5\u0d45 \u07f6)sin(\u07d9) sin(\u07da\u0be5 \u0d45 \u07f6) \u0d45 \u074d\u1240\u0373\u0d45 \u074f\u0753\u1241\u074e\u0740\n\u0d45 \u07db\u0752\u0b36\u1240\u0373\u0d45\n\u074f\n\u0753\n\u1241\u1246\u0096\u0083\u0090(\u07d9) + cot(\u07da\u0be5 \u0d45 \u07f6)tan(\u07da\u0be5) cot(\u07d9)\u1247\u1249 \u0740\u0753cos(\u07d9\u0d45 \u07dc) + sin(\u07d9\u0d45 \u07dc) cot(\u07da\u0be5 \u0d45 \u07f6) (2)\nwhere \u074e\u0003is the distance from the tool to the forward failure plan in m, \u074fis the width of the side crescent in m,89\n\u07f6 is the angle of internal friction in deg, \u0003\u07da\u0be5 is the rupture angle in deg, \u07d9 is the rake angle of the tool from90\nthe horizontal in deg and \u07dc is the angle of soil-tool friction in deg.91\nFurthermore, the width of the side crescent was calculated using an empirical regression equation92\nrecommended by Kuczewski and Piotrowska (1998), and the rupture angle \u07da\u0be5 was obtained by minimizing93\nthe total force (Grisso et al., 1980; Zhang and Kushwaha, 1995). The horizontal and vertical forces were94\ncalculated using the following two equations, respectively (McKyes, 1985):95\n\u0bc1\u0732 \u0d4c \u0732\u0095\u008b\u0090(\u07d9 \u0d45 \u07dc) \u0d45 \u0bd4\u073f\u0740\u0753 \u0085\u0091\u0096(\u07d9) (3)\n\u0bcf\u0732 \u0d4c \u0732\u0085\u0091\u0095(\u07d9 \u0d45 \u07dc) \u0d46 \u0bd4\u073f\u0740\u0753 \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u123a\u0376\u123b\nwhere \u0bc1\u0732 is the horizontal force in kN and \u0bcf\u0732 is the vertical force in kN.96\nAccording to Equations (2), (3) and (4), the tillage system parameters considered for the calculation of the97\nhorizontal and vertical forces can be grouped into three main categories: soil engineering properties, tool98\ndesign parameters and operational conditions.99\n3.2 Modeling the variability of tillage system parameters100\nOver the years, many methods and techniques have been developed for modeling the variability of a random101\nvariable depending on the number of data points and assumptions about the shape of the underlying102\ndistribution (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Nikolaidis et al., 2005). In this work, a combination of graphical and103\nquantitative techniques for modeling the variability of soil engineering properties is proposed. An illustration104\nof these techniques is shown in Fig. (1). This approach provides an accurate estimation for the variability of105\nsoil engineering properties and allows one to select the best probability distributions that can simulate the106\nvariability of these properties. An empirical relationship for determining the number of intervals of the107\nhistograms of soil engineering properties was used (Haldar and Mahadevan, 2000a). Two statistical tests108\nwere implemented for selecting the probability distributions of these properties, namely the chi-square test109\nand the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Ang and Tang, 1975). A total of 57 variations of soil engineering110\nproperties, representing 57 different soil samples collected from the literature (Appendix I), were considered111\nfor implementing our mixed technique approach (Abo Al Kheer et al., 2007). These data represent different112\nsoil texture types, namely sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay, and sand.113\nThe variability of tool design parameters and operational conditions were modeled after proposing the114\nfollowing two assumption: 1) the tool width and rake angle have uniform distributions with lower and upper115\nbounds, based on the manufacturing accuracy and 2) the tool working depth, surcharge pressure and tool116\nspeed have normal distributions with standard deviations equal to 5% of their mean values. Usually, a117\nuniform distribution is used to model the variability associated with manufacturing processes, and a normal118\ndistribution is used to model the variability of a random variable when no data are available (Haldar and119\nMahadevan, 2000a; Fox, 2005).120\n3.3 Sensitivity analysis121\nSensitivity analysis aims at studying the relationships between the output and input variables. Differential122\nsensitivity analysis is considered to be the most commonly employed method in sensitivity analysis (Irving,123\n1992). This method deals with local sensitivity analysis by focusing on the evaluation of the partial124\nderivatives \u07f2\u0742 \u07f2\u0755\u2044 of the function f. Many approximation methods are used to calculate the partial125\nderivatives of f . Forward, backward and central differences are the three most common forms. The central126\ndifference method requires more computing time, but it yields a more accurate approximation. Therefore, this127\nmethod was used in this work to calculate the partial derivatives of the horizontal and vertical forces for the128\nmean values of the tillage system parameters, and for a constant change equal to\u0003\u03bf\u0755\u0bdc\u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0372\u0372\u0373\u0755\u0bdcwhere\u0003\u0755\u0bdc is a129\ntillage system parameter.130\nHowever, differential sensitivity analysis leads to a local sensitivity analysis at mean values of the input131\nrandom variables and does not take into account the dispersion effects of these variables. Therefore, we132\npropose a new sensitivity method to overcome this limitation. The main advantage of the proposed method is133\nits simplicity, compared to other available methods, such as the variance-based sensitivity. Its main drawback134\nis that it cannot take into account correlations between random variables. However, the proposed method135\nprovides more accurate estimations for the dispersion effects of tillage system parameters than the classical136\ndifferential sensitivity methods.137\nThis method, which consists of two main steps, is shown in Fig. (2). In the first step, the confidence interval138\nbounds (\u0755\u0be0 \u0bd4\u0beb\u01e1\u0755\u0be0 \u0bdc\u0be1) were computed for each tillage system parameter according to Equation (5) and (6). The139\nvalues of the confidence interval bounds depend on the probabilistic characteristics (distribution type and140\ndistribution parameters) of each parameter. The higher the dispersion of a parameter, the greater the141\ndifference between the confidence interval bounds.142\nPr[\u0755 \u0d51 \u0755\u0be0 \u0bdc\u0be1] \u0d4c \u07d9 \u0374\u2044 (5)143\nPr[\u0755 \u0d52 \u0755\u0be0 \u0bd4\u0beb] \u0d4c \u0373\u0d46 \u07d9 \u0374\u2044 (6)144\nwhere Pr[\u2219] is the probability operator, \u0755\u0be0 \u0bd4\u0beb is the upper confidence interval bound, \u0755\u0be0 \u0bdc\u0be1 is the lower145\nconfidence interval bound and 100(\u0373\u0d46 \u07d9)% represents the confidence interval.146\nIn the second step, the differences between the maximum and minimum values of the tillage forces were147\ncalculated in the confidence interval of each tillage system parameter. These differences indicate the148\ndispersion effects of the tillage system parameters on the tillage forces. The greater the difference between149\nthe maximum and minimum values of the tillage forces, the greater the influence of the variability of the150\ntillage system parameters on the tillage forces.151\nThe relationships between the tillage forces and the tillage system parameters show that152\n\u0bc1\u0732\u0d6by\u0bdc\u0d6f\u0003and\u0003\u0732\u0bcf\u0d6by\u0bdc\u0d6f\u0003are either increasing or decreasing functions (Appendix II). Therefore, the dispersion153\neffects of the tillage system parameters were estimated by computing the differences between the tillage154\nforces at the maximum and minimum value for each tillage system parameter\u0003\u123a\u0755\u0be0 \u0bd4\u0beb\u01e1\u0755\u0be0 \u0bdc\u0be1). The confidence155\ninterval was selected to be 95%. For the bounded probability distributions (uniform distribution \u2026),156\n\u0755\u0be0 \u0bd4\u0beb and\u0003\u0755\u0be0 \u0bdc\u0be1 represent the two limits of the random variable.157\n3.4 Quantifying the variability of tillage forces158\nWe propose a methodology, shown in Fig. (3), for quantifying the variability of tillage forces based on the159\nMCS technique. The number of generated values (n) was chosen to obtain an accurate correlation coefficient160\nbetween the horizontal and vertical forces. This methodology consists of the following steps:161\n1- Generate n values for each tillage system parameter according to its probabilistic characteristics.162\n2- Compute the total force \u0732 according to Equation (2) for different values of\u0003\u0003\u07da\u0be5\u123a\u07da\u0be5 \u2208 [0 \u2212 90\u00b0]), for the set163\nof tillage system parameters obtained in step 1. This is followed by the selection of the minimum value164\nof\u0003\u0003\u0732 \u0003to respect the passive earth pressure theory and the corresponding value of\u0003\u07da\u0be5.165\n3- Calculate the horizontal and vertical forces according to Equations (3) and (4), respectively.166\n4- Repeat Steps 1, 2 and 3 for each set of tillage system parameters.167\n5- Calculate the mean and variance values for the horizontal and vertical forces, and then apply the goodness-168\nof-fit tests to select the distribution that can best model the variability of these forces.169\n6- Compute the correlation coefficient between the horizontal and vertical forces, required to calculate the170\nfailure probability, according to Equation (7).171\nCorr( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf) \u0d4c \u07e9( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf) = Cov( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf)\n\u0da5Var( \u0bcf\u0732)Var\u123a\u0732 \u0bcf) (7)\nwhere Corr( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf) is the correlation coefficient between the horizontal and vertical forces, Cov( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf)is172\nthe covariance between the two forces and Var(\u2219) is the variance of a random variable.173\nThese steps were applied to quantify the variability of tillage forces for the shank of a chisel plough, as174\nshown in Fig. (4). In fact, the relative positions of tines on a tool frame both laterally and in the direction of175\nmotion have a significant effect on tine forces (Godwin and O'Dogherty, 2007). For simplicity, the variability176\nof tillage forces for only one shank was quantified, without considering the effects of tine interactions.177\n3.5 Failure probability178\nFailure probability is always associated with a particular performance criterion that defines a certain limit179\nstate function G({x}, {y}) = 0 in physical space, where {x} is a vector of deterministic variables and {y} is a180\nvector of random variables. The limit state function represents the surface between the safe region181\nG({x}, {y}) > 0 and the failure region G({x}, {y}) < 0. Conventionally, failure probability can be calculated182\nby using the following integral:183\nf\u0732 = Pr[G({x}, {y}) < 0] \u0d4c \u0db1 \u06ae \u0db1 f{y}\nG({x},{y})\u0bb4\u0b34 \u0d6by1,\u22ef,yn\u0d6fdy1\u22efdyn (8)\nwhere Pf is the failure probability, f{y}(y1,\u22ef,yn) is the joint probability density function for the random184\nvariables {y} and Pr[.] is the probability operator when the integral is performed over the failure region185\nG({x}, {y}) < 0.186\nIn general, evaluating the integral in Equation (8) is not simple because it represents a very small quantity187\nand all of the necessary information for the joint density function is not available. Even if this information is188\navailable, evaluating the multiple integral is extremely complicated (Haldar and Mahadevan, 2000b; Radi and189\nEl Hami, 2007). Therefore, several analytical approximations of this integral are used to evaluate failure190\nprobability, namely, the FORM and the second-order reliability method (SORM), which are considered to be191\nreliable computational methods (Zhao and Ono, 1999; Kharmanda et al. 2004). These methods are based on192\nthe determination of the design point \u0003\u0732 \u2217 and a calculation of the reliability index \u07da in normalized space (Fig.193\n5). The design point\u0003\u0732 \u2217, also called the most probable point of failure, represents the worst combination of194\nthe random variables and the search of design point in normalized space is an optimization problem. The195\nreliability index \u07da is the minimum distance from the origin of the axes in the normalized space to the limit196\nstate surface. The failure probability can be calculated, according to the FORM method by\u0003\u0732\u0bd9\u0003\u0bbf\u0bc8\u0bcb\u0bc6 =197\n\u03a6(\u0d46\u07da), where \u03a6(\u2219) is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution. However,198\nanalytical approximation methods require a background in probability and statistics. Other simulation199\ntechniques can be used to evaluate failure probability with only a minimal background in probability and200\nstatistics, but these methods require more computing time as compared to analytical approximation ones. The201\nmethod commonly used for this purpose is the MCS technique.202\nCorrelations between some or all random variables {y} in the limit state function G({x}, {y}) may modify the203\nfailure probability of a structure (Haldar and Mahadevan, 2000b). To estimate the failure probability when204\ntaking into account correlations between random variables, the correlated random variables should be205\nconverted into non-correlated normalized variables, and the original limit state function, which is expressed206\nin terms of correlated random variables, must be rewritten in terms of non-correlated normalized variables.207\nTwo transformations were used for this purpose (Der Kiureghian and Liu, 1986; Liu and Der Kiureghian,208\n1986). The first one transforms the correlated random variables to correlate reduced variables and the second209\none transforms the correlated reduced variables to uncorrelated reduced variables.210\nA structure should be designed so that its strength is greater than the effects of the applied forces. Therefore,211\nthe limit state function of the studied shank, shown in Fig. (6), can be written analytically as:212\nG({x}, {y}) \u0d4c \u07ea\u0bd4\u0bd7 \u2212 6\u073e\u0744\u0b36\u0d64(\u072e\u0b36 \u0d45 \u072e\u0b38) \u0bc1\u0732 + \u072e\u0b38tan(\u07d9) \u0bcf\u0732\u0d68\u0d45 1\u073e\u0744 \u0bc1\u0732 \u2265 0                                                (9) \nwhere \u03c3\u0b5f\u0b62 is the allowable stress in MPa, \u073e\u0003\u0083\u0090\u0086\u0003\u0744 are the dimensions of a shank section in mm, \u072e\u0b36 is the213\nshank length in mm, \u0bc1\u0732 and \u0bcf\u0732 are the horizontal and vertical forces in kN, \u072e\u0b38 is the distance from the214\nhorizontal force to the tool side in mm and \u07d9 is the rake angle in deg.215\nThe same method used in Section 3.3 was used here to determine the dispersion effects of the input random216\nvariables \u0003\u123a\u07ea\u0bd4\u0bd7\u01e1\u0732 \u0bc1 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf\u01e1\u073e \u01e1\u0744 \u01e1\u072e\u0b36\u01e1\u072e\u0b38\u01e1\u07d9\u123b on the limit state function. The allowable stress was considered as217\nconstant\u0003\u123a\u07ea\u0bd4\u0bd7 = 235 MPa). The probability distributions of\u0003\u073e \u01e1\u0744 \u0003and\u0003\u072e\u0b36 were defined as uniform218\ndistributions with lower and upper bounds, based on the manufacturing accuracy, of \u00b10.1mm. We assume219\nthat \u072e\u0b38 has a normal distribution with a coefficient of variation equal to 0.05. The variability of the rake angle220\nwas considered during the modeling of the variability of tillage forces (Section 3.4), so it is considered here221\nas a deterministic variable.222\nThe results obtained from the sensitivity analysis study show that only \u072e\u0b36 and \u03b1 can be considered as223\ndeterministic variables, so the other variables were taken as random variables during the reliability analysis.224\nThe vectors of deterministic and random variables are given by Equations (10) and (11).225\n{x} = (\u07ea\u0bd4\u0bd7\u01e1\u072e\u0b38\u01e1\u07d9) (10){y} = ( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf\u01e1\u073e \u01e1\u0744 \u01e1\u072e\u0b36) (11)\nTo evaluate failure probability for the studied shank, one million simulation cycles were used to perform the226\nMCS technique. Meanwhile, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm was used to determine227\nthe design point and to compute the reliability index according to the FORM method.228\n229\n4. Results and discussion230\n4.1 Probabilistic characteristics of soil engineering properties231\nHistograms and PDFs of soil engineering properties are shown in Fig. (7), and their probabilistic232\ncharacteristics are given in Table (1). It is worth noting that the soil engineering properties do not have the233\nsame probability distributions and that only the internal friction angle has a normal distribution. In addition, it234\nis noted that the histogram shapes are non-homogeneous, particularly the histograms of the external friction235\nangle and soil-tool adhesion. This is most likely due to the following: 1) an insufficient sample size is236\nconsidered in this work, 2) the samples are not representatives of real soil textures or 3) there are inter-237\ncorrelations between the soil engineering properties. However, from a statistical point of view, 57 samples238\nare sufficient to model the variability of a random variable. As mentioned in the report of Fox (2005), a set of239\n25 samples or more is sufficient to obtain an accurate estimation of the variability of a random variable. In240\norder to improve the estimation of the variability of soil engineering properties, a larger number of samples241\nshould be employed and the inter-correlations between these properties should be investigated.242\n4.2 Effects of the variability of tillage system parameters on tillage forces243\nThe effects of the variability of soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and operational conditions244\non tillage forces, using differential sensitivity analysis and the proposed method, are shown in Table (2).245\nAccording to the results of differential sensitivity analysis, we observe that the influence of the variability of246\nthe rake angle on the horizontal force is larger than the influence of the variability of the other variables,247\nwhereas the vertical force is most influenced by the variability of the internal friction angle. The influences of248\nthe variability of soil-tool adhesion and surcharge pressure are very small as compared to the influences of249\nthe variability of the other variables. These results are in agreement with many works reported in the250\nliterature (McKyes and Ali, 1977; Godwin and O'Dogherty, 2007).251\nIn contrast, the proposed method shows that the effect of the variability of soil cohesion on both the vertical252\nand horizontal forces is the largest as compared with the effects of the variability of the other variables. This253\nis caused by the high dispersion of the soil-tool adhesion values around the mean value. Furthermore, only254\nthe variability of the surcharge pressure has no significant effect on either the horizontal or vertical forces.255\nWe conclude that only the surcharge pressure can be considered as a deterministic variable and the variability256\nof the soil-tool adhesion and the other variables must be integrated into the probabilistic analysis of tillage257\nforces.258\n4.3Quantifying the variability of tillage forces for the shank of a chisel plough:259\nHistograms and PDFs of the horizontal and vertical forces are shown in Fig. (8). The probabilistic260\ncharacteristics of these forces are presented in Table (3). From a statistical viewpoint, these results are in261\naccord with the central limit theorem (Ang and Tang, 1975). The majority of the horizontal and vertical force262\nvalues are found to range between 0.5 and 6 kN and between 0.2 and 3 kN , respectively. The shape263\nparameters of the horizontal and vertical forces are\u0003\u07e6\u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0376\u0376\u037b , \u07e6\u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0376\u0376\u0379, respectively. This means that the264\ndispersions of these forces are very important and should be taken into consideration in the reliability265\nanalysis. Furthermore, the horizontal and vertical force values were positive for each set of tillage system266\nparameters. In fact, the vertical force value depends on the rake angle. The positive vertical forces can be267\nattributed to the rake angle of 45\u00b0 considered in this study. Zhang and Kushwaha (1995) and Godwin (2007)268\nreported that the vertical force becomes negative when the rake angle is larger than 60\u00b0.269\nThe correlation coefficient between the horizontal and vertical forces is found to be\u0003\u07e9( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf) = 0.93. This270\nmeans that the relationship between the two forces is positive and quasi-linear, as illustrated in Fig. (9). In271\nreality, the horizontal force \u0bc1\u0732 and vertical force\u0003\u0732\u0bcf are calculated by combining the total force with the force272\nof adhesion (McKyes, 1985). The effect of the total force on the horizontal and vertical forces is greater than273\nthe effect of the adhesion force such that the value of correlation coefficient is close to one. The correlation274\nbetween \u0bc1\u0732 and\u0003\u0732\u0bcf don\u2019t reflect a causal relation between these forces but it is due to the fact that these275\nforces were calculated according to Equations (3) and (4).276\n4.4 Failure probability evaluation:277\nThe results obtained by the MCS technique and the FORM method for the failure probability are almost278\nidentical, for the assumption of non-correlation,\u0003\u0732\u0bd9\u0b3f\u0bc6 \u0bbc\u0bcc = 1.07 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b37\u01e1\u0732 \u0bd9\u0b3f\u0bbf\u0bc8\u0bcb\u0bc6 = 1 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b37, and279\ncorrelation, \u0bd9\u0732\u0b3f\u0bc6 \u0bbc\u0bcc = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b37\u01e1\u0732 \u0bd9\u0b3f\u0bbf\u0bc8\u0bcb\u0bc6 = 1.47 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b37 existing between the tillage forces, Table (4).280\nThis is due to the quasi-linearity of the limit state function at the design point (Zhao and Ono, 1999). In281\naddition, the correlation between the horizontal and vertical forces has no significant effect on the failure282\nprobability. Therefore, it is concluded that the FORM method can be used to estimate the failure probability,283\nwithout taking into account the correlation between the horizontal and vertical forces, with sufficient284\naccuracy. This makes the estimation of failure probability simpler and less time-consuming (Haldar and285\nMahadevan; 2000b), as compared to MCS calculations. This is because the calculation of the failure286\nprobability using the MCS technique requires one million iterations, while the SQP algorithm needs only a287\nfew iterations (between 6 and 10 iterations) to find the design point and calculate the failure probability.288\n289\n5. Conclusions290\nThis work aimed at proposing a probabilistic approach for modeling the variability of tillage forces by taking291\ninto account the variability of soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and operational conditions.292\nThis approach was implemented for modeling the variability of tillage forces for the shank of a chisel plough.293\nThe results allow us to draw the following conclusions:294\n1- The soil engineering properties do not have the same probability distributions and only the internal friction295\nangle has a normal distribution.296\n2- The effect of the variability of soil cohesion on both the vertical and horizontal forces is the largest as297\ncompared with the effects of the variability of the other tillage system parameters. In addition, only the298\nvariability of the surcharge pressure has no significant effect on either the horizontal or vertical forces.299\n3- Both the horizontal and vertical forces have lognormal distributions with \u07e4 \u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u037a \u0379\u0374 \u01e1\u07e6\u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0376\u0376\u037b and300\n\u07e4 \u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0372\u0372\u0376\u01e1\u07e6\u0d4c \u0372\u01e4\u0376\u0376\u0379 for the horizontal and vertical forces, respectively. The relationship between the301\nhorizontal and vertical forces is positive and quasi-linear with\u0003\u07e9( \u0bc1\u0732 \u01e1\u0732 \u0bcf) = 0.93.302\n4- The MCS technique and the FORM method provide nearly identical results for the failure probability,303\nalthough the FORM method led to simpler and faster calculations, when assuming non-correlation between304\nthe tillage forces\u0003\u123a\u0732 \u0bd9 = 1.47 \u00d7 10\u0b3f\u0b37). Correlations between the vertical and horizontal forces only slightly305\nchanged the reliability level.306\n307\nAcknowledgments308\nThe authors acknowledge Dawn Hallidy from LeHavre University, France, for her collaboration during this309\nwork.310\nReferences311\nAbo Al-Kheer, A., Kharmanda, M.G., El-Hami, A., 2007.
