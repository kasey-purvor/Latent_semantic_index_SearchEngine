The development of \ntechniques, such as sol-gel, that allow the production of very highly orientated thin film \nPZT at temperatures compatible with standard Si fabrication techniques has further \nenhanced this interest4,5. For devices to be made successfully the ferroelectric material \nproduced should be high quality with a minimum of rosettes and for many applications \nhighly [111] orientated.  \n \nThe scale of interest for the grain and domain structures is now sub-micron. Standard \nanalytical techniques do not allow the determination of ferroelectric properties at this \nscale. The development of atomic force microscopy has allowed the routine evaluation \nof surface topography of these materials, and in the last few years a number of \nadditional techniques have been developed. Prime among these for determining the \nferroelectric properties of material is piezoelectric atomic force microscopy (P-AFM). P-\nAFM detects the converse piezoelectric response of the material under investigation and \nallows the mapping of the ferroelectric domains. The use of an AFM tip as a small and \nmoveable conductive probe has reduced the scale of the study of piezoelectricity to just \na few tens of nanometers. Using P-AFM it is possible to map ferroelectric domains in a \nfilm without a top electrode and without altering them6,7,8. \n \nExperimental \n \nA schematic of the experimental arrangement used to perform PFM is shown in Figure \n1. A sinusoidal signal was passed between the AFM tip and the back electrode of the \nPZT sample, usually held at ground. The signal used in all cases was 18kHz and 2V \npeak-peak. The resonant frequency chosen was well below the fundamental resonant \nfrequency for the cantilever and 2 V p-p was below the coercive field for the samples \nunder evaluation. The converse piezoelectric effect causes a distortion in the shape of \nthe sample due to the external electric field. When completing PFM, a lock-in amplifier is \nused to filter the distortions due to the converse piezoelectric effect from the bulk \ntopographic signal. In this way it is possible to obtain both topographical and \npiezoelectric data in one experimental run. \n \nIt has also been shown that when a field in excess of the coercive field is applied \nbetween the AFM tip and ground the material in that region is poled9,10. Using this \ntechnique it is possible to manipulate the domain structure in the ferroelectric material. \nBy applying a DC bias in series with the AC signal passed between the tip and ground, it \nis possible to produce hysteresis loops from localised regions of the material11,12. In this \npaper we use the term \u03b433 to describe the response of the ferroelectric film under \ninvestigation. \n \nFilms were prepared using a sol-gel technique that has been described in earlier work4. \nThe films were fired at two temperatures, initially, a pyrolysis temperature of 200\u00baC for \nsamples fired on Pt back electrodes for 30 seconds with samples fired on ITO being fired \nfor 2 minutes at 450\u00baC.  A final phase transformation temperature of 520\u00baC for samples \non Pt with a dwell of 5 minutes, the ITO samples were fired at 600\u00baC for 20 minutes. \n \nA Siemens D5005 system using Bragg-Brentano geometry and Cu k\u03b1 radiation was \nused to perform XRD analysis of the samples. \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nTopography \n \nSamples of lead PZT(30\/70) deposited on Pt\/MgO, Pt-Ti\/SiO2 and ITO\/Glass where \nexamined using tapping mode AFM. Figure 2, shows the topography for a sample of \nPZT\/Pt\/MgO. This sample was very highly [100] orientated, the film consisted of small \ngrains, less than 100nm in diameter, with a small number of defects. The defects are not \nclearly seen on the topographic image of the film surface but are readily seen in the \npiezoresponse P-AFM image. The maximum Z-range for the region investigated was \n12nm, no long range surface features can be seen in the image. Figure 3, shows the \ntopography obtained for a sample of PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2. The sample was highly [111] \norientated and consists of small grains, less than 100nm in diameter, that appear with-in \na larger ordering of the PZT. The maximum Z-range for the sample was 23nm. The \ntopography of the surface of a PZT\/ITO\/Glass sample, shown in Figure 4, consists of a \nsmall number of large grains that are centred on a single rosette nucleation site. The \nsize of the individual grains varies from between ca. 1\u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm, the maximum Z-\nrange for the image is 38nm. An XRD examination of the PZT on ITO\/Glass showed that \nthe  grains in the PZT layer are randomly orientated.  \n \nThe difference in the observed surface microstructure for the PZT samples originates \nfrom the nucleation density and subsequent growth of the PZT. The production of a \nferroelectric thin film by the metalo-organic route consists of a number of steps. In the \ncase of the production of perovskite (piezoelectric) PZT, the sol is first pyrolised, this \nforms the non-piezoelectric pyrochlore phase, this is then transformed by high \ntemperature annealing into the piezoelectric perovskite phase. The transformation from \npyrochlore to perovskite is dependent on a number of factors and of high significance is \nthe density of suitable sites for the nucleation of the perovskite phase at the PZT-\nelectrode interface. In the case of a Pt electrode on Ti\/SiO2 the crystallographic lattice \nmismatch between the PZT and Pt produces a very large number of nucleation sites as \ndoes the formation of a transient Pt3Pb intermetallic, which significantly reduces the \nactivation energy for phase transformation13,14. The orientation of PZT grown depends \non the lattice mismatch between the Pt and PZT. In the case of Pt on SiO2 the PZT \ngrows as a very [111] orientated phase. For Pt\/MgO the PZT develops into a very highly \norientated [100] structure due to lattice constraints imposed on the Pt by the MgO. In this \ncase the Pt grows on the surface of the MgO highly orientated in the [100] plane with \nrespect to the surface of the MgO. In both cases this leads to a transformed perovskite \nphase that consists of a large number of small grains that are highly columnar. The ITO \nback electrode is nearly completely amorphous with very little crystal structure. \nNucleation of the perovskite phase occurs at defect sites and is a function of the drying \ntime and temperature15. Subsequent growth of the perovskite phase occurs from the \nnucleation site and spreads through the pyrochlore phase. The interfaces between two \ngrowth regions develop into grain boundaries. \n \nPFM studies \n \nPFM studies were performed on samples of PZT grown on Pt-Ti\/SiO2, Pt\/MgO and \nITO\/Glass. The PFM image obtained for PZT\/Pt\/MgO is shown in Figure 5. The image \nshows that the majority of the grains of PZT are not poled and that the surface has an \nalmost neutral piezoelectric response. The only regions of high response are those \naround or near the defects in the surface.  \n The application an external electric field that is greater than the coercive field of the film \nwill pole the sample. Figure 6 shows the PFM response of the film after a poling \nexperiment. The sample shows excellent poling characteristics, as expected for a highly \norientated sample. The larger contrast between the background and black (+ve applied \nto AFM tip) and white (-ve applied to AFM tip) indicate that the as deposited film forms \nwith an inherent internal electrical bias.  \n \nThe PFM studies completed for samples of PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 show that the domain \nstructure for the PZT is neutral over the surface of the sample, shown in Figure 7. Very \nfew regions of defects can be seen and the sample appears to be very homogenious. \n \nBy contrast the domain structure for the PZT\/ITO\/Glass structure is very different, as \nshown in Figure 8. The structure of the domains within grains and the image as a whole \ngives a picture that is consistent with the XRD findings of a randomly orientated PZT \nfilm. Individual domains can be seen within grains and the grain boundaries are clearly \nseen. Some grains appear to have a neutral piezoelectric response while others are \nstrongly poled. The application of a field above the coercive field does not result in \ncomplete poling. This is a result of the random orientation of the grains which does not \nallow complete poling, shown in Figure 9. It is clear that some of the grains have poled \nmore completely than others and that some regions have not poled at all. This is \nconsistent with a piezoelectric material of random orientation.  \n \nHysteresis loops performed with PFM \n \nHysteresis loops were performed on the samples using PFM. The hysteresis loops \nproduced for each of the PZT samples tested are shown in Figure 10. In all cases a \ntypical open hysteresis loop for a piezoelectric material is observed. For the PZT\/Pt-\nTi\/SiO2 material the \u03b433 value obtained using PFM was 62pm\/V. This value is very close \nto that determined for d33 using a Berlingcourt method, of 55pm\/V16, and indicates that \nthe \u03b433 value returned by the PFM system is close to the d33, t. The hysteresis loop for \nPZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 has a slight amount of asymmetry with a coercive field of +22V\/\u03bcm and -\n18V\/\u03bcm.  A similar degree of asymmetry has been noticed for samples of PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 \nwhen conducting pyroelectric experiments17.  \n \nThe hysteresis loop produced by PZT\/Pt\/MgO is highly asymmetric on the as grown thin \nfilm. The values for the coercive field for the sample are +35V\/\u03bcm and -20\/\u03bcm. The loop \nproduced for PZT\/Pt\/MgO is not quite as square in shape as the PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 loop. \nThese changes in the shape of the loop are likely to derive from the differences in the \ncrystallographic orientation of the film. Figure 11, shows the relative orientations of \ndomains in the PZT grown on Pt\/MgO and Pt-Ti\/SiO2. The difference in the orientation of \nthe domain relative to the surface means that in the case of PZT\/Pt\/MgO the field \napplied to the surface of the film is all in the correct orientation to re-orientate the \ndomain. In the case of PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 the field applied to the surface does not have the \nsame direct effect on domain re-orientation. The changes in the hysteresis loop shape \nare exaggerated in the case of PFM due to the very small spatial distribution of field \nwhen using the AFM tip as a top electrode.  \n \nThe hysteresis loop for the PZT\/ITO\/Glass structure is by contrast to PZT grown on Pt \nsymmetrical. The coercive field for the sample is +\/-18V\/\u03bcm. No comment can be made \non the shape of the hysteresis loop as this varies depending on where the loop is \nobtained due the random orientation of the sample. However, in all cases the hysteresis \nloop obtained for PZT\/ITO\/Glass shows a symmetrical shape.  \n \nAsymmetry in the perovskite material has been attributed to the presence of oxygen \nvacancies pinning domains and a variation in top and bottom electrode. It has also been \nproposed that oxygen defects at the interface between the ferroelectric material and the \nelectrode causes a built in electrical bias to develop in the film. The variations in \nhysteresis loop found in the three systems investigated are unlikely to arise from \nelectrode effects as a variation is seen with the same electrode system. Therefore, the \nchanges in hysteresis loop are due to changes in defect density and their location in the \nfilm.  \n \nThe amount of oxygen vacancies presents, and hence the inherent electrical bias of the \nfilm, is dependent on a number of factors. The other major factor is the interaction of the \ngrowing perovskite phase with the electrode system. This interaction occurs at two \ndistinct stages. The first is the interaction of the electrode with the sol as it transforms \nfrom pyrochlore into perovskite. The second is whether the film is blocking to oxygen \ntransport or not. It is likely that the different interactions between the sol and the back \nelectrode will affect the defect density at the interface. The presence of Pt allows the \nformation of Pt3Pb, a transient intermetallic phase, which reduces the activation energy \nfor the transformation of the pyrochlore phase to the perovskite phase13. The difference \nin orientation of the Pt electrode system, [111] on SiO2 and [100] on MgO, may change \nthe activation energy for formation of the perovskite phase. The changes in the crystal \nstructure at the interface may impose additional strain on the PZT grown on [100] Pt \nover that grown on [111] Pt. It may also alter the amount of oxygen defects formed if the \nrate of reaction changes, an increase in the number of defects formed would be \nassociated with a slowing of the formation of perovskite PZT. The symmetrical loop for \nPZT\/ITO\/Glass is due to the availability of oxygen in the ITO. The perovskite PZT is able \nto scavenge oxygen from the interface between ITO and PZT to produce a film that has \nno inherent built in charge separation. The trend observed for the symmetry of the \nhysteresis loops is, with most symmetrical first, PZT\/ITO\/Glass; PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 and then \nPZT\/Pt\/MgO. \n \nFatigue experiments were performed on the samples of PZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 and \nPZT\/Pt\/MgO. The results are shown in Figure 12 and show the trend expected for \nsamples with a variation in oxygen defects. The MgO substrate system fatigues more \nrapidly than the SiO2 system, this result supports the view that asymmetry shown in both \nthe PFM surface maps and hysteresis loops is due to oxygen defects and not the \ndifference in top and bottom electrodes. \n \nConclusions \n \nPFM, tapping mode AFM and XRD have shown that the substrate used for growth of \nPZT affects the surface topography and the crystallographic orientation. The orientation \nof the PZT film is a strong factor on the hysteresis loop produced by the sample and also \non the degree of homogeneity found in the poled samples. Samples exhibiting very high \ncrystallographic uniformity show a higher \u03b433 than those with a random orientation. The \nmap of piezoelectric response found for highly orientated samples indicates that it is \npossible to pole the film almost completely. In the randomly orientated sample the \npiezoelectric map shows that it is not possible to completely pole the sample. The \nsample is behaving much like a polycrystalline compact. Changes in the symmetry of the \nhysteresis loop have been found. These changes are due to the availability of oxygen at \nthe electrode PZT interface or the amount of defects formed at the interface. Fatigue \nexperiments have shown that the PZT\/Pt\/MgO system fatigues more rapidly than the \nPZT\/Pt-Ti\/SiO2 system. This result confirms that the variation in PFM response and \nhysteresis loop is due to oxygen defects and not the variation in top and bottom \nelectrode. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank Dr C Shaw, Dr Q Zhang, Dr P Rayner, Mr A Stallard, \nThe EPSRC, TDK Corporation Japan, The Inamori Foundation and the Royal Academy \nof Engineering. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n \n1.
