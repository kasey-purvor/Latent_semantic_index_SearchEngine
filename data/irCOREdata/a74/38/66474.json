In DFT many-body\nelectron interactions are captured through the exchange-\ncorrelation ~XC! functional which is the only unknown quan-\ntity. The accuracy of DFT is therefore ultimately governed\nby the quality of the XC functional and how well it approxi-\nmates the nonlocal nature of XC interactions. A great deal of\nunderstanding has been gained from the local density\napproximation,3 ~LDA! in which the XC energy is written\nsolely in terms of the density n(r),\nExc\nLDA@n~r!#5E n~r!exchom@n~r!# dr. ~1!\nFor many properties the LDA works surprisingly well de-\nspite its simplicity. However, the severity of the local ap-\nproximation inevitably leads to limitations that are now\nwidely known. At the next level is the generalized gradient\napproximation4 ~GGA! which provides a semilocal descrip-\ntion of exchange and correlation by including the gradient of\nthe density. The GGA is not a unique functional and there are\nnow many parametrizations; however, it can be written in a\ngeneral way as\nExc\nGGA@n~r!#5E n~r!excGGA@n~r!,\u201en~r!# dr. ~2!\nDespite the added sophistication, the GGA does not provide\na consistent improvement over the LDA in all situations.\nAlso, the GGA does not achieve chemical accuracy\u2014the\nlevel at which chemical reactions can be studied. The GGA\nform has been extensively developed and tested in recent\nyears, and it is believed that near-optimal forms have been\nattained. Consequently, other semilocal approximations that\ngo beyond the GGA have been proposed that include, for\nexample, the Laplacian of density \u201e2n(r) or the orbital ki-\nnetic energy density t .5 However, these attempts have\nachieved limited success and it may become an unavoidable\nsituation that XC functionals with full nonlocality are neces-\nsary if chemical accuracy is to be achieved.\nIn this paper we investigate the level of accuracy that can\nbe achieved within DFT using a fully nonlocal XC functional\nknown as the weighted density approximation6,7 ~WDA!. We\nclosely follow the recent work of Nekovee et al.8 who used\nthe wave-function-based variational Monte Carlo ~VMC!\nmethod to calculate total XC energies Exc , XC energy den-\nsities exc , and XC holes nxc(r,r8) in three strongly inhomo-\ngeneous electron gas systems. We use similar cosine-type\nexternal potentials to generate the density distributions and\nshow that the pointwise difference between the LDA and\nWDA XC energy density follows the same shape, sign, and\nmagnitude as the Laplacian of the density for each system\nstudied. This result is in agreement with that found by Nek-\novee et al. for the difference between the LDA and VMC\ncalculations. We also find that the WDA reproduces the same\ntrends for Exc as the VMC method when compared with the\nLDA and GGA, and that it reproduces the correct features of\nthe XC hole over the wide range of densities encountered in\nthese systems.\nSince the WDA is fully nonlocal, the construction of\nExc\nWDA is very different from the LDA and GGA expressions\ngiven by Eqs. ~1! and ~2!. The WDA utilizes the exact DFT\nexpression for the XC interaction9,10 which is given by\n~atomic units are used throughout!\nExc\nWDA@n~r!#5\n1\n2E E n~r! nxc~r,r8!ur2r8u drdr8, ~3!\nwhere nxc(r,r8) is given in terms of the coupling-constant-\nintegrated pair-correlation function gxc(r,r8):\nnxc~r,r8!5n~r8!@gxc~r,r8!21# . ~4!\nThe only approximation made in the WDA is the form of\ngxc(r,r8), which is only known exactly for a homogeneous\nelectron gas.

The WDA includes many basic\nyet fundamental elements of electron interactions that are not\nincluded in other XC functionals. These features include sat-\nisfying the sum rule on the XC hole given by relation ~6! and\nthe correct 21\/(2r) limit of the XC energy density as r\n\u2192\u2018 . The WDA is, in principle, self-interaction free and it\nalso has a favorable form for the asymptotic limit of the XC\npotential, decaying as 21\/(2r) as r\u2192\u2018 , which differs from\nthe exact result by a factor of 1\/2. Another advantage of the\nWDA is that it has a simple form with a straightforward\nphysical meaning\u2014the XC energy in the WDA is modeled as\na Coulomb-type interaction that occurs between the density\nn(r) and its XC hole nxc(r,r8) at the point r8, and therefore\ndoes not require any explicit information regarding the many\nelectron wave function C . However, the choice of model\nfunction GWDA is of fundamental importance in the WDA.\nThere exist many functions that fulfill the small number of\nexact conditions imposed on GWDA and therefore maintain\nthe properties described above. However, we have shown in\nrecent work12 that the WDA is very sensitive to the choice of\nthe analytic function and that some functions are more physi-\ncal than others. Specifically, we found a particularly promis-\ning model to be that of a simple Gaussian function, and\nconsequently we adopt this model in this work. The function\nhas the following form:\nGWDA@ ur2r8u;n\u02dc #5C~r8!exp@ ur2r8 u\/l~r8!#2, ~7!\nthe parameters C(r8) and l(r8) being determined at each\npoint in terms of the weighted density parameter n\u02dc .

The particular value of n\u02dc that is\nchosen is the one that satisfies the XC sum rule for the actual\ninput density. We have developed an efficient method for\ncalculating the required integrals in the WDA using a peri-\nodic representation of the density,13 the full details of the\nimplementation of which are given in Ref. 12.\nFIG. 1.

To be\nconsistent with the VMC calculations we determine the den-\nsities from self-consistent Kohn-Sham calculations using the\nLDA. This procedure gives rise to density profiles that are\napproximately sinusoidal in one direction, with the modula-\ntion controlled by the amplitude vq and the size of the wave\nvector q. All three systems have the same average density\nn053\/4prs\n3\n, with density parameter rs52a0, and we use\ncubic cells containing N548, 60, and 52 electrons. The\nsizes of the cells are designed such that they admit two,\nthree, and four cycles of the cosine potential within the\nlength of each cell. The densities therefore contain two,\nthree, and four peaks, respectively, in the direction of inho-\nmogeneity. With the predefined number of electrons, N, this\ncorresponds to wave vectors of size 1.12kF\n0\n,1.56kF0 , and\n2.18kF\n0\n, where kF\n0 5(3p2n0)1\/3 is the Fermi wave vector as-\nsociated with the average density n0. For all three systems\nwe use vq52.08eF\n0 where eF\n0 is the Fermi energy correspond-\ning to n0. The values of q and vq used here lead to strong\nvariations in the density on the scale of the local Fermi\nwavelength lF\n0 52p\/kF\n0\n.\nThe WDA XC energy expression is written in terms of a\nparticular XC hole, and so the XC energy density exc\nWDA is\nwell defined in the WDA. The VMC method utilizes the\nsame expression for Exc\nVMC ; consequently, exc\nWDA can be di-\nrectly compared with exc\nVMC\n. While this is also true for the\nLDA @although the LDA can be simplified to give Eq. ~1!#,\nthis is not feasible within the GGA since it is possible to add\na function that modifies the integrand of Eq. ~2! and yet\nintegrates to zero, thereby leaving Exc\nGGA unchanged.14 For\nthe purpose of comparing with VMC data, we define exc\nLDA as\nbeing the integrand of expression ~1! and exc\nWDA as\nexc\nWDA@n~r!#5\n1\n2 n~r!E n~r8!

This procedure was also carried out for the ho-\nmogeneous gas constants in the GGA. Consequently this\nmay lead to slight differences in Exc\nLDA and Exc\nGGA calculated\nin this work. For the GGA results we use the form developed\nby Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof17 ~PBE!.\nIn Fig. 1 we present plots of Dexc5exc\nLDA2exc\nWDA\n, along\nthe direction of inhomogeneity, as well as the corresponding\ndensity and Laplacian of the density \u201e2n(r) for the q\n51.12kF\n0 and q51.56kF0 systems. It is clear that Dexc bears a\nclose relation to \u201e2n(r), which is consistent with the VMC\nfindings.8 Although the densities used here are different, the\nmagnitudes of the deviations produced by the WDA are also\nin very good agreement with the VMC results.\nShown in Table I is the WDA total XC energy per elec-\ntron, Exc\nWDA\/N , along with the difference relative to the LDA,\nDExc\nLDA\/N5(ExcLDA2ExcWDA)\/N , and the GGA, DExcGGA\/N\n5(ExcGGA2ExcWDA)\/N , for all three systems. For both the LDA\nand GGA, the deviations are positive for the q51.12kF\n0 sys-\ntem. As the wave vector and hence the degree of inhomoge-\nneity increase, DExc\nLDA\/N and DExc\nGGA\/N become negative,\nwith the LDA providing closer agreement with the WDA in\nboth cases. Again, it is not possible to compare our WDA\nvalues directly with the VMC results since we are using dif-\nferent densities; nevertheless, exactly the same trends are\nobserved for the VMC total XC energy relative to the LDA\nand the GGA given in Table I of Ref. 8.\nShown in Fig. 2 is the WDA XC hole nxc(r,r8) associated\nwith a reference electron situated at ~a! a density maximum\nand ~b! a density minimum for the q51.12kF\n0 system. The\nWDA XC hole is obtained by fixing the reference electron at\nr and determining n\u02dc at each point r8 within the plane parallel\nto q. This determines C(r8), and l(r8) and these are then\nused to construct nxc(r,r8) at each point in the plane. When\nthe electron is at a density maximum the XC hole is centered\ndirectly at the site of the electron and is contracted in the\ndirection of inhomogeneity. As the electron moves toward\nthe density minimum the XC hole trails behind the electron,\nwhich remains centered at the density maximum and still\ncontracted in the direction of q. Around the density mini-\nmum, the XC hole becomes highly nonlocal as it develops\ntwo minima due to the peaks in the density either side of the\nelectron. This is shown in Fig. 2~b! where the electron is\nlocated in the center of the plane, equidistant from the XC\nhole minima. The same variations in the XC hole between\nhigh and low densities are observed for the two other sys-\ntems. The nonlocal features exhibited by the WDA are in\ncontrast to the LDA, where XC holes are always spherically\nsymmetric and centered on the electron. This is illustrated in\nFig. 2~c! for an electron at a density minimum. The XC holes\nproduced by the WDA exhibits the same nonlocal features as\nthe VMC calculations.\nBy examining systems that are strongly inhomogeneous\nwe have shown that the WDA, together with a very simple\nmodel for the pair-correlation function, can yield values for\nexc that are in close agreement with the variational Monte\nCarlo method. This also leads to a successful determination\nof total XC energies by the WDA, as demonstrated by the\nsimilar trends in Exc with the VMC data. The difference in\nexc for the LDA relative to the WDA ~and VMC method! is\nstrikingly linked to \u201e2n(r) for the systems studied here. It is\ntherefore reasonable to assume that including \u201e2n(r) in\nsemilocal XC functionals may provide an important contri-\nbution to the correction of LDA XC energies. However, we\nfind that these Laplacian-type errors only occur for systems\nthat are sufficiently inhomogeneous. When the value of vq is\nreduced so that the systems become more slowly varying, we\nfind that Dexc does not resemble \u201e2n(r).18 Consequently,\nthe inclusion of \u201e2n(r) may only improve semilocal XC\nfunctionals in strongly inhomogeneous regimes.\nWe are encouraged by the similarities between the WDA\nand VMC results. The WDA provides XC energies and holes\nat a level comparable to the VMC method, and yet is only\nmoderately more expensive than the GGA compared with\nquantum Monte Carlo techniques. The WDA is also simple,\nphysically intuitive, and easy to develop, since modifying the\nfunctional form only involves changing the model function\nGWDA. We therefore expect the WDA to play an increasingly\nimportant role in XC functional development in the future.\nP.P.R. thanks M.
