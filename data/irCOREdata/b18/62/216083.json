Following a discussion on the transformation of the BNP and an analysis \nof the importance of nationalism in extreme right rhetoric, we put forward two \nhypotheses, 1: the modernisation of the discourse of extreme right parties in the \nBritish context is likely to be related to the adoption of a predominantly civic \nnarrative and 2: in the context of British party competition the BNP is likely to \nconverge towards UKIP, drawing upon elements of its perceived winning formula, \ni.e. a predominantly civic rhetoric of national identity. We proceed to empirically \ntest our hypotheses by conducting a twofold comparison. First, we compare the \nBNP\u2019s discourse pre and post 1999 showing the BNP\u2019s progressive adoption of a \ncivic narrative; and second the BNP\u2019s post-1999 discourse to that of UKIP in order \nto illustrate their similarities in terms of civic values. \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe result of the 2009 European Parliament (EP) elections points to a significant \nrecent development in British politics. Notably, a rise in support for small parties \nmore generally and for the extreme right British National Party (BNP) more \nspecifically. This relative rise of the extreme right in Britain has been a particular \nfeature of the local and EP electoral arenas, where the electoral system is more \npermissive of small party representation.  In the 2009 EP elections, the BNP increased \nits support receiving for the first time since its establishment an impressive 6.2 \npercent of the votes cast nationwide and gained its first two seats in the EP. It has also \nexperienced a rise in its local support, increasing its representation in the 2008 local \nelections in a number of councils around the country and securing a seat in the high \nprofile London Assembly. National elections have also witnessed this trend, though to \na much lesser extent. In the 2005 general election, the BNP more than tripled its vote \nshare to 0.7 percent compared to the 2001 general election. In the more recent 2010 \ngeneral election the BNP failed to achieve the success it had hoped for, not winning a \nsingle seat including Barking where the party and its leader had been extremely active. \nHowever they did increase their relative vote share by 1.2 percent which still entails a \nrelative rise.  \n \nThis article analyses this relative rise of the BNP by focusing on changes in its \ndiscourse.  Building on the literature of the modernisation of the BNP and sharing the \nview that this modernization is linked to the party\u2019s attempt to construct a new master \nframe,1 this article argues that the transformation of the BNP may be understood \nthrough the prism of nationalism. We offer an explanation that considers narratives of \nnational identity as a determining factor in the transformation of the discourse of the \nBNP. More specifically we analyse the ways in which the BNP utilises the elements \nof British national identity in its rhetoric. The article argues that during Griffin\u2019s \nleadership, the BNP has made a discursive choice to shift the emphasis from ethnic to \n  \n2 \ncivic elements of British national identity. Post 1999 the BNP has begun to filter the \nsymbolic resources of the British nation from a predominantly civic prism. This \nprocess has been facilitated by an attempt to resemble the discourse of the United \nKingdom Independence Party (UKIP), a non extreme right, however small and \nincreasingly successful party on the fringes of the British political system, which \nsimilarly to the BNP places immigration at the core of its agenda. \n \nIn particular the article puts forward two main hypotheses, 1: the modernisation of the \ndiscourse of extreme right parties in the British context is likely to be related to the \nadoption of a predominantly civic narrative and 2: in the context of British party \ncompetition the BNP is likely to converge towards UKIP, drawing upon elements of \nits perceived winning formula, i.e. a predominantly civic rhetoric of national identity.   \n \nIn order to illustrate the above argument, this article proceeds in three steps. First, we \ndiscuss the process of the transformation of the BNP and illustrate the importance of \nnationalism in extreme right rhetoric. Second, we examine the civic elements of \nBritish culture and the perceived linkages by the electorate between the BNP and \nUKIP. Third, we empirically test the hypotheses by conducting a twofold comparison. \nWe commence by comparing the BNP\u2019s discourse pre and post 1999 as presented in \ntheir manifestos and proceed by outlining the similarities- in terms of civic values- \nbetween UKIP\u2019s and the BNP\u2019s discourse post 1999.    \n \nThe role of nationalism in extreme right discourse  \n \nWhile the increasing significance of the BNP should be treated with caution, its rise is \nan important trend in British politics that deserves- and has been increasingly \nattracting- scholarly attention. 2  Though the rise of the extreme right is a cross-\nEuropean phenomenon, it is particularly interesting in Britain because the latter often \nappears to be \u2018immune from\u2019 the infiltration of anti-immigrant right wing parties in \nmainstream politics due to either its constitutional arrangements and its restrictive \nelectoral system or its liberal and inclusive political culture. \n \nIn order to understand the relative rise of the extreme right in Britain, scholars have \nfocused on a number of factors, including sociological, economic and political. In \nparticular, Eatwell focuses on the party\u2019s modernisation, including changes in its \nrhetoric, the abandonment of fascist ideals, less emphasis on violence, membership \nexpansion and new propaganda techniques 3 such as the use of media sources and the \nestablishment of the BNP\u2019s journal \u2018Identity\u2019. While we agree with the view that the \nrise of the BNP can persuasively be seen through an examination of the party\u2019s own \nactions and strategies, it is our contention that the changing use of elements of \nnational identity in its nationalist narrative is integral to the party\u2019s transformation.  \nNational identity plays a prominent role in the extreme right parties\u2019 discursive toolkit. \nIt refers to a set of unique features that only \u2018our\u2019 group possesses and therefore \ndistinguishes \u2018us\u2019 from the \u2018other\u2019. It has long been standard in the study of nations \nand national identities to classify these constructs according to two distinct types, \nmost commonly labelled the \u2018civic\u2019 and the \u2018ethnic\u2019.4 The former emphasises historic \nterritory, legal political community and a civic culture, and is thus a voluntary \ncommunity. The latter places emphasis on a community of birth, descent and native \nculture and is therefore perceived as an organic entity.  \n  \n3 \nExtreme right parties are by default exclusionary and hence customarily portray the \nnation as an organic entity in their rhetoric. They tend to focus on the linear \nprogression of the nation through time and stress its homogeneity and continuity. This \nentity has fixed membership determined through an elaborate network of individual \ntraits, assumed to be concomitants of nationality, and a simple but largely rigid set of \nidentifiers. These identifiers are confined to elements such as bloodline, language, \nreligion or community of birth, making the nation an exclusive club to which \nmembership is restricted. There is a clear line of delineation between members and \noutsiders. The criteria for inclusion in the nation are ethnic whereby outsiders are \nexcluded from the national community on the basis of race, creed and ethnicity. In \nother words, extreme right wing party discourse sets rigid national boundaries and \nstresses the primordial, ethnic and exclusive elements of the nation and its identity.  \n \nWhile the ethnic-civic typology can be useful as a system of classification, nations \ncannot be neatly sifted between those that belong to one category or to the other. \nCertain signifiers of national identity can be perceived both in voluntarist and organic \nterms, depending on how they are used by social actors.5 Particularly in an age of \ninternational interconnectedness and European integration, the virtues and morals \nidentified as core to the identities of democratic nations in general are not those of \nexclusivity and intolerance but rather, multicultural diversity, liberalism and \ntoleration. These facts have increased the necessity for extreme right wing parties to \nannex liberal\/civic values in their agenda in order to attain political legitimacy.    \n \nBritish political culture and the dynamics of party competition in the fringes of \nthe party system  \n \nCivic elements, such as citizenship and respect for the laws, tend to prevail in British \nnational identity. Because of its long standing liberal tradition, Britain is often \nincluded in the family of civic nations. With a long array of Enlightenment \nphilosophers, including John Locke and John Stuart Mill, and a history of ideals such \nas individualism, secularism, a free market economy and the support of the private \ndomain of the citizen against arbitrary power exercised by the state, Britain boasts a \nlong standing tradition of liberalism. In its classical sense the latter entails strong \nsupport for the rule of law; pluralism, toleration and a notion of baseline equality of \nrights, protections and opportunity; a negative conception of freedom; and a free \nmarket economy with free trade.  \n \nCharacterised by flexibility, British political institutions have evolved through time \ndeveloping a model of liberal democracy that has not been ruptured by periods of \nviolent revolution or dictatorship and authoritarian rule. British national political \nculture is based on tolerance and accommodation rather than radical social change. \nThis lack of political violence enhances both a sentiment of superiority over \ncontinental neighbours such as France and Germany and contributes to the emergence \nof a democratic model characterised not only by liberal institutions but also a political \nculture with a long standing tradition of civil society. This flexibility is attributed to \nthe principle of Parliamentary sovereignty -effective as a substitute to a codified and \nentrenched constitution- and the Westminster model of democracy. Pride in political \ninstitutions is a key element of Britishness. For example, among the respondents of \nthe 2003 International Social Survey Programme series of questions, 82 percent \nresponded that respecting British laws and institutions is important for being British.6  \n  \n4 \n \nCultural diversity \u2018and the need to cherish it as part of one\u2019s historical inheritance\u20197 is \na fundamental characteristic of British liberal democracy. As a principle that entails \nthe interaction and peaceful co-existence of various cultures under one overarching \nstate, it is inevitably intertwined with basic British liberal concepts such as pluralism, \ntoleration, freedom of speech and acceptance of others. Paradoxically, \nmulticulturalism can be traced back to the institutions of British imperialism, stressing \na freedom loving providential form of Britishness set against the absolutism of the \nContinent.8  \n \nLiberalism, accommodation and multiculturalism are civic ideals that in theory \ndirectly contradict the extreme right principles.  However, extreme right parties may \nutilise the liberal elements of national identity in their discourse thus altering the \npermeability of the boundaries of the nation. National membership becomes portrayed \nas less restricted to those who do not share the same race, creed or community of birth \nbut rather to those who do not share \u2018our\u2019 liberal values such as democracy, \nmulticulturalism and the rule of law. Individualistic liberalism is translated to the \nnational level stressing the significance of the autonomy of the nation and its right to \nnational self-determination. Hence extreme right wing parties may escape the flagship \nof \u2018racism\u2019 as they progressively associate themselves with civic ideals such as \n\u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018emancipation\u2019. Justification for inclusion becomes institutional rather \nthan organic.  \n \nTraditional models of party competition expect mainstream parties to converge \ntowards the median voter. Parties on the fringes of the system however appeal to a \nparticular segment of the electorate. In the British context, the fringe parties of the \nright closest to one another are the BNP and UKIP. Seeing themselves as competitors \nin the right-wing authoritarian arena, the extreme right BNP and the non-extreme but \nanti-immigrant right UKIP operate in the same electoral arena, drawing from the same \npool of voters. Electoral support for both parties appears to be correlated when they \nstand together. There are a number of perceived linkages by the electorate between \nthe two parties, including placing priority on the immigration issue and a similar \ndiscourse on immigration and the loss of national identity.9   \n \nParties are likely to draw on an existing winning formula from within their own \npolitical system. They have an incentive to draw on the identity resources of the \nnation which they address, especially in the context of an already existing winning \nformula. This article offers a nation-specific explanation arguing that in its task to \nconstruct political legitimacy, the BNP borrows a civic narrative from UKIP, a \nsuccessful party in the fringes of the system which is not stigmatised.   \n \nThe above framework yields two empirically testable hypotheses.  \n \nHypothesis 1: the modernisation of the discourse of extreme right parties in the \nBritish context is likely to be related to the adoption of a predominantly civic \nnarrative.  \n \nHypothesis 2: in the context of British party competition the BNP is likely to \nconverge towards UKIP, drawing upon elements of its perceived winning formula, i.e. \na predominantly civic rhetoric of national identity.   \n  \n5 \n \nBased on the above two hypotheses, this article argues that the transformation of the \ndiscourse of the BNP is contingent upon a shift from a predominantly ethnic to a \npredominantly civic narrative. Framing the BNP\u2019s electoral appeal in a civic \nframework has been facilitated by the adoption of an existing successful civic \nnarrative provided by UKIP.   \n \nThe transformation of the BNP: a progressive adoption of a \u2018civic\u2019 narrative \n \nIn order to illustrate the progressive shift towards a civic discourse, this section \nconducts an in-depth qualitative analysis of party manifestos as documents that \nessentially define party political identity. Manifestos are uniquely authoritative \nstatements of narratives that express the collective beliefs of the party as a whole and \nexemplify the way in which the party chooses to portray itself externally. We have \npurposely chosen to exclude internal documents from our analysis not because we \ndeny in any way their significance but because we primarily focus on the way the \nparty chooses to portray itself externally. We choose the employment of qualitative \nanalysis of party manifestos since our prime interest is to explore both the way in \nwhich the party frames its discourse as a whole and the context in which words and \nphrases are used. We take 1999 to be the critical juncture of the transformation or \n\u2018modernization\u2019 of the BNP as it marks the beginning of the Griffin leadership and his \nsignificant reform agenda. \n \nOur hypotheses testing henceforth is twofold. First, we analyze the BNP\u2019s nationalist \nnarrative and the utilization of the resources of national identity in the party discourse \npre and post 1999 in order to empirically test our first hypothesis. From the BNP\u2019s \npre-1999 manifestos we identify three principal types of nationalism: racial, economic \nand imperial. We argue that in this period the racial type serves as a premise for the \nother two. A comparison with the post-1999 manifestos illustrates however that this is \nno longer the case. In addition, their concept of imperial nationalism has undergone a \nsignificant transformation, shifting from emphasis on unity via assimilation to \nemphasis on unity in diversity.  Second, we compare the nationalist discourses of \nUKIP and the BNP in the post-1999 period illustrating their core similarities and \nBNP\u2019s policy convergence towards UKIP in order to empirically test our second \nhypothesis. We proceed by comparing their policies on immigration and European \nintegration. Immigration is core of both parties\u2019 agenda and the European Union (EU) \nis part of this anti-immigration agenda, encompassing attitudes towards foreigners in a \npolitical system of free movement of people and labour.  \n \nHypothesis 1: The BNP\u2019s discourse pre and post 1999  \n \nIn the 1997 electoral manifesto, the BNP outlines the cornerstones of British \nnationalism as political sovereignty, ethnic identity, economic nationalism, and \nnational unity.10 This summarises their nationalist ideals within the 1982-1999 period.  \nFocusing on their manifestos during this time, we have identified the BNP\u2019s \nnationalist narrative as based on three pillars: racial, economic and imperial. Their \nracial nationalism is the premise for the other two: \u2018our nationalism is ethnic as well \nas political- in fact it is ethnic before being political\u2019.11 Economic ties are based on \nrace; immigration is refuted on the basis of race.  \n \n  \n6 \nThe BNP portrays Britain as an organic entity based on primordial ties between \nAnglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and Celtic peoples. The prime bond is race and kinship: \n\u2018we recognise the ethnic kinship which exists between the indigenous people of the \nUnited Kingdom [\u2026] we believe it is important to preserve this kinship, and where \npossible, strengthen it\u2019.12 All their arguments derive from this racial understanding of \nthe nation.  \n \nA notable example is immigration, which is perceived first and foremost a racial \nproblem, a threat to \u2018the racial homogeneity and character of the British population\u2019.13 \nImmigration is presented as a holistic programme which should be altogether reversed; \nthere is no distinction between skilled or unskilled, legal or illegal. The UK can not \nand should not exist as a multi-ethnic or multi-cultural entity and this is non-\nnegotiable: \u2018Immigration of racially unassimilable peoples into this country must be \ncompletely ended and a massive programme of repatriation or resettlement of \ncoloured immigrants and their offsprings must begin\u2019.14 Race therefore becomes a \nbasis of discrimination and exclusion on racial grounds. \n \nTheir economic nationalism is based on a set of protectionist policies aiming to \npreserve the British economy from foreign competition and intervention. However, it \nis important to note that this economic argument seeking the nationalisation of British \nindustry derives not from a class-based Marxist internationalist perspective, but from \na nation-based argument, in which the core of the nation is race and primordialism. In \nother words racial nationalism is the fundamental principle of economic nationalism \nin the BNP\u2019s pre 1999 policy, illustrating the dominance of ethnic perspectives in \ntheir narrative.    \n \nTheir emphasis on national unity illustrates the third pillar of the BNP\u2019s nationalist \nnarrative, i.e. imperial nationalism. By this we refer to their intent to hold the UK \ntogether at all cost and to oppose separatist movements and all types of \ndecentralisation, for example devolution and the partial autonomy of Scotland and \nWales. They are also adamantly opposed to the increasing autonomy of Northern \nIreland. Note that their policy on Northern Ireland and the IRA is identical throughout \nthe period 1982-1997, despite significant developments which marked the relationship \nbetween Britain and Ireland at the time. Throughout this period, \u2018the real issue is race\u2019 \nand their policy proposals towards the various components of the UK is one of \nassimilation: \u2018Britain\u2019s ethnic identity based as it is on a mingling of English, Scottish, \nWelsh and Irish strains, must be preserved\u2019.15   \n \nThe BNP\u2019s post 1999 manifestos are characterised by a shift in this rhetoric. Although \nrace still figures, it does so less prominently and it no longer forms the premise of \ntheir nationalist agenda which gradually and increasingly comprises of civic values \nsuch as liberal sovereignty and the rule of law. Their nationalism is portrayed as \nseeking to preserve the basis of civic values and \u2018to create and sustain social political \nstructures in which individual freedom, equality before the Law, private property and \npopular participation in decision making is to some extent at least genetically pre-\ndetermined\u2019.16 These are all liberal values that the party had previously explicitly \nrejected as \u2018liberal sickness\u2019.  \n \nReference to ethnicity and race appears to be in decline.  Civic political bonds, such \nas citizenship, which feature in the 2005 manifesto as the basis of inclusion, become \n  \n7 \nincreasingly mentioned. A language of birth has been progressively overshadowed by \na language of political rights such as \u2018the right to decide who shall enjoy citizenship \nand residence within its national borders.\u201917 The premise is now economic nationalism \nincreasingly governed by civic principles. This includes the rejection of immigration, \nnow not solely on the basis of race but increasingly on the basis of its potential \neconomic and social impact, such as unemployment, welfare dependency and \neducational failure. Immigration is refuted on the basis of the rule of law and the right \nfor sovereignty. Holistic immigration is replaced by \u2018illegal immigration\u2019 which did \nnot feature in their previous manifestos. Race appears but is neither prominent nor the \npremise of the BNP\u2019s post-1999 anti-immigration agenda: \u2018in any society claiming to \nbe based on the Rule of Law, it must be beyond serious controversy that all illegal \nimmigrants must be deported as soon as they are discovered. We will increase the \nfunding and political will behind such operations by the police and the courts\u2019.18 Note \nthe emphasis on the importance of political and judicial instruments.  \n \nA particularly interesting development is the disappearance of sections on the unity of \nthe UK, what we have termed above as \u2018imperial nationalism\u2019 and their complete \npolicy reversal on devolution. Devolution is now not only accepted, but accepted on \nthe basis of a civic conception of nationalism in line with the democratic nationalist \nprinciple of subsidiarity. The BNP is now committed in preserving the devolved \nassemblies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, making clear that \u2018returning to \nrule from one British parliament in Westminster is not an option\u2019. 19  The party \nacknowledges the problems created by the West Lothian question and proposes to \nintroduce not only a Parliament for England, thus extending devolution even further, \nbut also creating a Pan-British Parliament as a civic overarching institution. Their \nmodel resembles more a federation or confederation \u2018of the British nations\u2019 (note the \nplural) rather than an assimilated union such as the one proposed during the 1980\u2019s \nand 1990\u2019s. Instead of assimilation, the BNP 2005 manifesto proposes unity in \ndiversity, an implicit policy of multiculturalism which on the one hand would allow \ndifferent ethnic communities a degree of cultural autonomy, for example the \ncompulsory teaching of both the English and indigenous languages as well as the \nteaching of citizenship at school while at the same time proposing a central \nadministration to deal with \u2018civic\u2019 issues, such as foreign policy and the economy.  \n  \nHypothesis 2: Comparing the BNP\u2019s nationalist narrative to that of UKIP \n \nThe premise of UKIP\u2019s nationalist narrative is economic prosperity and self \ndetermination. This underlines its opposition to the EU. The core of its nationalism, as \nput forward in its 2001 manifesto, is therefore predominantly civic: \u2018UKIP supports \nan inclusive concept of British nationality with common citizenship and shared \nvalues\u2019. 20  UKIP\u2019s civic nationalist argument, that \u2018our nation\u2019 has the right to \nsovereignty and political independence holds that in order to be considered British, \npeople need to accept British liberal values. The unity of the British nation is \nprimarily based on political institutions including British common law, parliamentary \nsovereignty and individual freedom over state control.  \n \nThis pursuit of the right to national self-determination implies a rigid opposition to \nimmigration, a policy fundamental in UKIP\u2019s discourse, justified however on the \nbasis of civic ideals. Its nationalist narrative does not include any reference to race \nand ethnicity, as the party claims to be resolutely opposed to racism. It is this \n  \n8 \nopposition to immigration that forms the core similarity with the BNP\u2019s agenda. \nAlthough we are in no way arguing that the BNP has abandoned all reference to race \nor that its discourse is identical to that of UKIP, we do hold that during the post-1999 \nperiod, it has progressively borrowed from the latter in an effort to frame its discourse \nin a civic manner.  \n \nOne core area where the BNP borrows from UKIP is a language of political rights and \nthe rule of law seeking to justify a nationalism based on the civic conception of \nfreedom: \u2018we are the only party left that genuinely believes in freedom \u2013freedom for \nthe individual, freedom for businesses and local communities, freedom from \npatronising political correctness and from intolerance or injustice\u2019. 21  Increasing \nreferences to \u2018freedom\u2019 in the BNP\u2019s post-1999 discourse illustrate its attempts to \nreplicate UKIP\u2019s nationalist narrative, advocating among others freedom from the EU, \nfrom crime, from the oppression of the state, from unemployment, freedom of \nassociation and freedom of speech.22 Freedom to decide the destiny of \u2018our\u2019 nation is \ngradually replacing earlier BNP justifications of nationalism premised on colour, \nblood and creed (see previous section).   \n \nThe following section illustrates this gradual shift in the BNP\u2019s rhetoric to reflect that \nof UKIP\u2019s by examining two sets of policies, including immigration and European \nintegration.  \n \nImmigration \n \nImmigration is an issue of increasing political salience and core to both the BNP\u2019s and \nUKIP\u2019s agendas. Both parties are opposed to immigration. In its 2008 manifesto \nUKIP advocates freezing immigration and the deportation of illegal immigrants and \nthose immigrants who commit crimes. A similar emphasis on illegal immigrants is a \nnew trend in the BNP\u2019s discourse completely absent from its pre-1999 manifestos but \nforming the core of the reformulation of its strategy towards immigrants. It is also \nnoteworthy that both parties pledge to keep the UK\u2019s responsibility towards asylum \nseekers and refugees with UKIP claiming to \u2018keep our proud tradition of helping \ngenuine asylum seekers who fear for their lives\u201923 and the BNP promising to \u2018abide by \nour obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees\u2019.24  \n \nIn UKIP\u2019s immigration agenda, the criteria for inclusion in the nation are \npredominantly economic. UKIP supports the deportation of illegal immigrants and the \nfreezing of immigration on economic grounds, claiming that large waves of \nimmigration hinder the performance of the British economy. It accepts the inclusion \nof certain numbers of immigrants so long as they are beneficial and make positive \neconomic contributions. Currently, it is argued, immigration is not beneficial for the \nimmigrants themselves as the economy cannot absorb them. A similar emphasis on \nthe social and economic consequences of increased levels of immigration is \nincreasingly characterising the BNP\u2019s discourse. While pre-1999, it is exclusively a \nracial nationalism that informs their anti-immigration agenda and all social and \neconomic consequences are attributed to the racial problem, post 1999 the premise of \nopposition to immigration has increasingly become economic, in line with UKIP\u2019s \napproach. Effectively immigration is opposed for resulting in economic ills such as \nunemployment, welfare dependency, and educational failure.         \n \n  \n9 \nEuropean integration  \n \nEU integration is a particularly interesting policy area in terms of the rhetoric of the \ntwo parties in question. Through an examination into their discourse, two principal \npoints may be discerned: (a) European integration is the main area where the BNP\u2019s \ndiscourse most resembles that of UKIP, and (b) this gradual adoption of civic \nterminology has coincided with the BNP\u2019s increased success in the 2009 European \nelections. \n \nBoth UKIP and the BNP reject European integration. They both argue that they stand \nagainst the EU as a political system but that they are not anti-European, thus making \nexplicit that their Euroscepticism is not justified in ethnic or racial but rather in \npolitical and economic terms. UKIP\u2019s rejection of the EU is based on civic liberal \nideals, including the right to national self-determination and the right of the nation to \nproduce its own laws within its territory. The party claims that it is seeking to restore \nthe right of authority from Brussels to Britain arguing in favour of Parliamentary \nSovereignty. UKIP views the EU as a political project and not just as a loose trading \narrangement which it would support. The EU political system is rejected on the basis \nthat it is alien to the British political system and does not coincide with British values \nof governing both the society and the economy; this mismatch \u2018is bad for our \neconomy, our self-respect and our prosperity\u2019.25  \n \nEU opposition can be thought of as UKIP\u2019s main raison d\u2019\u00eatre and has also become \nincreasingly prominent in the BNP\u2019s literature. European integration is the first issue \ndiscussed in the BNP\u2019s 2005 manifesto. Withdrawal from the EU has become the \nparty\u2019s sine qua non arguing that only after this occurs and Britain is governed by \nWestminster, parties can realistically put forward policy proposals. This is justified \nthrough a language of political rights. \u2018The European Union is an aspiring super state \nwhich would deprive the British people of their right to democratic self-government; \nsubject us to alien rule in the interest of a bureaucracy which has no loyalty to the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019.26 The BNP can be seen as influenced by UKIP and has attached a \ncivic undertone in its anti-EU discourse arguing that the EU deprives the British from \nthe right to self-government. The party uses the language of rights arguing that \u2018we \nshould have the right to make our own laws, our own international trade agreements \nand our own economic policy, and control our borders.27 Note that the discourse also \ncontains some ethnic references as it criticises the EU as a threat to the \u2018homogeneity\u2019 \nof the British nation these have significantly declined and are no longer the premise of \ntheir nationalist discourse.  \n \nConclusion  \n \nParadoxically, \u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019, \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 feature prominently in \nthe BNP\u2019s 2009 European manifesto. At first glance, such inclusive liberal democratic \nvalues appear by default contradictory to the ideals and principles of the extreme \nright. This article has highlighted this contradiction between liberal values and \nextreme right rhetoric on the one hand and has illustrated the way such ideals can \nbecome integral in extreme right nationalist narrative on the other. We have offered \nan account that links the transformation of the discourse of the BNP with the \n  \n10 \nprogressive adoption of civic values in its nationalist narrative. The originality of this \narticle lies in its analysis of the \u2018modernization\u2019 of the BNP through a nationalism and \nnational identity perspective. It is precisely its ability to utilise the liberal inclusive \nelements of national identity that accounts for the transformation of the party during \nthe past decade.  \n \nThis process has been facilitated by a progressive borrowing from UKIP\u2019s nationalist \nnarrative whose perceived winning formula expresses and justifies its policies in \nterms of liberal nationalist principles of the civic variety. We have examined the \nnarrative of the BNP in terms of that of UKIP illustrating that despite belonging to a \ndifferent ideological party family they may compared in terms of their operating on \nthe fringes of the British party system, placing immigration at the core of their agenda \nand being perceived as competitors by the electorate. Following from this, this article \nhas argued that in its task to construct political legitimacy, the BNP has been \nincentivised to draw on the civic identity resources already employed successfully in \nUKIP\u2019s rhetoric.  \n \nIt is the ability of an extreme right party to alter the boundaries of the nation in its \ndiscourse that could compromise Britain\u2019s \u2018immunity\u2019 from extremism. This is \ncertainly the case for the BNP since, as Copsey argues, it has recently become more \ninclusive in its rhetoric \u2018making it even more difficult to pin the \u2018fascist\u2019 or \u2018Nazi\u2019 \nlabel on the well-groomed bespoke suits of Britain\u2019s latest generation of neo-fascist \nextremists'.28 Changes in a party\u2019s discursive toolkit however are not the only factor \nin determining electoral change. The 2010 general election serves as a reminder for \nthis. Future research should go beyond examining the party itself into a wider analysis \nof the party system, the effects of institutional reforms and new electoral arenas, as \nwell as sociological and economic factors.  \n  \n11 \nNotes  \n                                                 \n1\n M.
