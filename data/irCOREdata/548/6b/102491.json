Groups did not differ significantly but\nloss of body fat and weight was greater in all groups compared\nwith the control group. In an intention to treat analysis, average\nweight loss was 5.9 kg and average fat loss was 4.4 kg over six\nmonths. The Atkins diet resulted in significantly higher weight\nloss during the first four weeks, but by the end was no more or\nless effective than the other diets.\nConclusions Clinically useful weight loss and fat loss can be\nachieved in adults who are motivated to follow commercial\ndiets for a substantial period. Given the limited resources for\nweight management in the NHS, healthcare practitioners\nshould discuss with their patients programmes known to be\neffective.\nTrial registration Clinical trials NCT00327821.\nIntroduction\nThe prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities is increasing in\nthe United Kingdom.1 Over half of British adults are now\noverweight, and half of these people will probably become\nobese.2 The estimated cost of obesity is \u00a30.5bn (\u20ac0.7bn; $0.9bn)\neach year to the NHS and \u00a32bn each year to the wider economy.3\nMost adults in the United States diet at some time, and trends\nin the UK are similar.4\u20136 Long term success rates tend to be poor,\nwith 50% of weight loss being regained within one year.7\nWith a market estimated to be worth \u00a311.2bn by 2007, it is\nnot surprising that the commercial sector has shown a keen\ninterest in weight loss programmes.Weight Watchers, the market\nleader, claims to have one million members (P Hunt, personal\ncommunication, 2005). Self help books that provide weight loss\nstrategies are often best sellers\u2014Dr Atkins\u2019New Diet Revolution has\nsold more than 10 million copies.8 Although commercial diets\nprovide consumers with a plethora of choice, data on their com-\nparative efficacy are limited.9\nOur study compared four popular commercial weight loss\nprogrammes with a control group. The diets\u2014representative of\nthe main approaches to weight management in the UK today\u2014\nwere the Slim-Fast plan (a meal replacement approach), Weight\nWatchers pure points programme (an energy controlled diet\nwith weekly group meetings), Dr Atkins\u2019 new diet revolution (a\nself monitored low carbohydrate eating plan), and Rosemary\nConley\u2019s eat yourself slim diet and fitness plan (a low fat diet and\na weekly group exercise class). We report the changes in weight\nand body fat over the six month study and describe dieting\nbehaviour and weight change in the participants at 12 months.\nMethods\nThe trial was an unblinded randomised controlled parallel\ndietary intervention study with a delayed treatment control\ngroup conducted at five regional centres (Surrey University, Bris-\ntol University, Nottingham University, Ulster (Coleraine) Univer-\nsity, and Queen Margaret University College, Edinburgh).\nRecruitment strategy\nWe identified potential participants via a BBC advertising\ncampaign (television and other forms of media). Participants\nwere chosen from people who lived within 30 miles of a test cen-\ntre, were aged between 18 and 65, and had a self reported body\nmass index between 27 and 40. Volunteers who fulfilled these\npreliminary inclusion criteria contacted their general practi-\ntioner for confirmation that they were eligible. Exclusion criteria\nwere coronary heart disease; type 1 or type 2 diabetes; renal,\nliver, or respiratory failure; gout; obesity with known cause\n(Cushing\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism); previous gastric or weight\nloss surgery; clinical depression; eating disorders; drug or\nalcohol misuse; any malabsorptive state (including lactose intol-\nerance); taking lipid lowering or anti-hypertensive drugs; taking\nany drugs (including orlistat and sibutramine) for weight loss;\nbeing treated for cancer; and being pregnant or breastfeeding.\nParticipants gave full informed consent. Three hundred people\nreturned the necessary documentation to enter baseline testing\nby the start date of the study (July 2002).\nProtocol assignment\nWe estimated that 60 initial participants (44 completers) were\nneeded per treatment group (allowing for a 25% dropout rate)\nfor an 80% chance of identifying a true difference of 4 kg of body\nweight loss (3 kg body fat), with a significance level of 5%. Thus,\neach of the five test centres aimed to recruit 60 participants (12\nfor each diet group; total sample size of 300). Participants took all\nbaseline tests before randomisation and each centre started the\nCite this article as: BMJ, doi:10.1136\/bmj.38833.411204.80 (published 23 May 2006)\nBMJ\nBMJ Online First bmj.com page 1 of 6\n on 12 June 2007 bmj.comDownloaded from \nstudy within six weeks of the start date. Seven participants were\nsubsequently excluded (fig 1). At each test centre, we stratified\nparticipants by sex and allocated them to a group using random\nnumber generation. Body mass index and age did not differ\nbetween groups or between centres.\nIt was not possible to blind the participants to the diet\nregimen and we did not attempt to blind the investigators during\nthe study or data analysis.\nProviding dietary programmes to participants\nFor the group based programmes (Weight Watchers and\nRosemary Conley), participants attended the most convenient\nclass and we reimbursed the costs of joining and attending one\nclass each week. Both parent companies signed a contract com-\nmitting to the provision of standard care. For Slim-Fast, we reim-\nbursed the cost of up to two meal replacements each day and\nprovided a copy of the Slim-Fast support pack. We gave partici-\npants in the Atkins group a copy of Dr Atkins\u2019 New Diet\nRevolution.8 We asked the members of the control group to\nmaintain their current diet and exercise pattern and offered\nthem any of the diets for six months at the end of study (free of\ncharge). All participants could claim reimbursement of travel\ncosts.\nStudy protocol and monitoring\nMeasures at baseline, two months, and six months included\nweight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, and fasting\nblood and body fat by whole body dual x ray absorptiometry. We\nexcluded the absorptiometry data of four participants from all\nanalyses because of errors at baseline. Monthly test centre meas-\nurements recorded weight in light clothing, blood pressure, and\nwaist circumference. We monitored renal function in the Atkins\ngroup by urea, electrolytes, and cystatin C, and these measures\nremained within the reference ranges.10 Participants completed a\nseven day diet and activity diary at baseline, eight weeks, and 24\nweeks. We gave no dietary or exercise advice so as not to\ncompromise the study.When we analysed the food diaries at two\nmonths we found that some of the participants on the Atkins diet\nwere not taking supplements of micronutrients as advised in the\nbook. Therefore, from week 10 we offered free daily supplements\nof multivitamins. All participants who withdrew completed a\nshort exit questionnaire. At 12 months, we recorded the weight\nand dieting behaviour from six to 12 months of all participants\nstill willing to attend test centres.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary analysis was on an intention to treat basis, with\nbaseline values carried forward to replace missing values (one\nparticipant was not used in this analysis as she withdrew because\nof pregnancy). A secondary analysis focused on the outcomes of\nthese dietary approaches in the most motivated subjects who\nprovided complete data (baseline, two months, and six months).\nAnalysis of variance showed that the test centre did not affect\ntotal weight loss in participants who completed. Attrition rates\ndid not differ between centres, so we analysed data from all par-\nticipants together. Baseline weight correlated with total weight\nloss (r= 0.33, P < 0.001) and was therefore used as a covariate in\nthe analysis of weight loss over time, which uses repeated meas-\nures analysis of covariance. In the intention to treat analysis, we\nused ANOVA to examine differences between groups; where\nANOVA indicated a significant group effect, we performed post\nhoc pairwise testing with Tukey\u2019s HSD (honestly significantly dif-\nferent) test. Before parametric testing, we assessed homogeneity\nof variance with Levene\u2019s statistic and tested for normal distribu-\ntion; we used Welch\u2019s F statistic if variance of the dependent vari-\nable was not equal across groups. We analysed differences\nbetween participants who completed and withdrew with t tests\nfor continuous variables (such as age) and \u00012 for categorical vari-\nables (such as sex and diet group).\nRecruited (n=300)\nRandomised (n=293): 214 (73%) women, 79 (27%) men\nSlim-Fast\n  (n=59)\nMen (n=17)\nWomen (n=42)\n(n=0)\nRosemary Conley\n  (n=58)\nMen (n=16)\nWomen (n=42)\n(n=3)\nControl group\n  (n=61)\nMen (n=15)\nWomen (n=46)\n(n=14)\nFollow-up\nmeasures\nAtkins diet\n  (n=57)\nMen (n=15)\nWomen (n=42)\n(n=2)\nWeight Watchers\n  (n=58)\nMen (n=16)\nWomen (n=42)\nSlim-Fast\n54\n49\n46\n42\n30\n42\n42\n(men 12,\nwomen 30)\n58*\nRosemary Conley\n52\n46\n43\n40\n30\n41\n41\n(men 10,\nwomen 31)\n58\nControl group\n46\n41\n38\n37\n28\n40\n40\n(men 10,\nwomen 30)\n61\nAtkins diet\n50\n46\n42\n38\n24\n40\n40\n(men 13,\nwomen 27)\n57\nWeight Watchers\n56\n52\n48\n49\n35\n47\n47\n(men 14,\nwomen 33)\n58\nWithdrew (dissatisfied\nwith allocated group) (n=1)\nExcluded after baseline tests (n=7):\n  Not eligible for study (n=4)\n  Withdrew consent (n=3)\nWeek\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\nIncluded in analysis\nof participants who\ncompleted (n=210)\nIncluded in\nintention to treat\n*1 excluded because of pregnancy\nFig 1 Flow of participants through the BBC diet trials\nResearch\npage 2 of 6 BMJ Online First bmj.com\n on 12 June 2007 bmj.comDownloaded from \nResults\nTable 1 shows the baseline demographics and anthropometric\nmeasures. The mean time spent on the diet was 24.3 (SD 1.56)\nweeks and did not differ between diet groups (F= 2.0, P = 0.12).\nWeight and fat loss\nMonthly weight loss by using all available data (fig 2) was high\ninitially but then slowed. Mean weight loss was significantly\nhigher in the Atkins group than in the other diet groups during\nthe first four weeks (F= 6.9, df = 3, P < 0.001): Atkins 4.4 kg (SD\n2.45, range 13.5 to 0.3 kg),Weight Watchers 2.86 kg (2.23, 12.9 to\n\u2212 0.9 kg), Slim-Fast 2.68 kg (2.33, 9.4 to \u2212 1.8 kg), and Rosemary\nConley 3.17 kg (2.02, 8.1 to \u2212 2.0 kg). At other time points, mean\nweight loss did not vary significantly between the diet groups\n(table 2).\nLoss of body fat showed similar patterns (table 2). In the first\ntwo months, the greatest loss of body fat was seen in the Atkins\ngroup; this loss was not significantly different from that seen in\nthe Weight Watchers or Rosemary Conley groups, but it was sig-\nnificantly greater than that seen in the Slim-Fast group. Fat loss\nwas significantly greater in all four diet groups than in the\ncontrol group. Between two and six months, fat loss (kg and per-\ncentage) slowed down, and the diets groups did not differ signifi-\ncantly. Between baseline and six months fat loss did not differ\nbetween diet groups, but fat loss in all diet groups was\nsignificantly greater than in the control group. All diets resulted\nin a reduction in waist circumference. Waist reduction (at six\nmonths) was highly correlated with total weight loss (r= 0.81,\nP < 0.001) and moderately correlated with percentage of body\nfat lost (r= 0.64, P < 0.001).\nTable 1 Mean baseline characteristics of participants in the BBC diet trials allocated to different diet regimens.

Regression analysis showed that total\nweight loss over time had the greatest influence on systolic and\ndiastolic pressure (adjusted R2 0.61 for change in systolic\npressure and 0.79 for change in diastolic pressure).\nGlucose concentrations fell slightly over time; only in the\nWeight Watchers group was fasting glucose significantly lower\nthan in the control group. In the first two months, a significant\nbut small drop in total cholesterol was seen in all diet groups\nexcept for the Atkins group. By six months, cholesterol had fallen\nsignificantly compared with the control group only in theWeight\nWatchers group (by 0.55 mmol\/l).\nAnalysis of completers\nA secondary analysis of data from participants who completed\nthe trial shows the range of weight lost by these highly motivated\nparticipants, who probably adhered most strongly to the\nrandomly allocated diets. Figure 3 shows the range of total\nweight lost; some participants lost more than 25 kg over the six\nmonth study period, whereas others gained weight (fig 3).\nAfter six months all diets resulted in a clinically useful mean\nreduction in percentage body weight: Rosemary Conley 9.9%\n(SD 5.6%),Weight Watchers 9.0% (5.6%), Atkins 8.9% (5.6%), and\nSlim-Fast 6.8% (5.3%); no significant differences were seen\nbetween the diets but all were more successful than no diet (con-\ntrols gained 0.95%, 3.3%). The proportion of participants who\ncompleted the trial and lost at least 10% of their body weight at\nsix months was 46% for the Rosemary Conley group, 45% for\nthe Atkins group, 36% for the Weight Watchers group, and 21%\nfor the Slim-Fast group. These losses were achieved despite the\nrandom allocation of diets.\nCompliance with the diets\nReported attendance at slimming clubs was similar at two\nmonths (Rosemary Conley 79%, Weight Watchers 66%) and six\nmonths (47%, 47%). Slim-Fast recommends 14 meal replace-\nments each week; participants reported 10 each week at two\nmonths and eight at six months. With the Atkins diet, reported\nportions of carbohydrate foods fell from 40 each day at baseline\nto five at two months and seven at six months.\nWithdrawal\nEighty three (28%) participants had withdrawn by six months\n(table 4); 53 (64% of the total number) had withdrawn by week 8,\nand at this time only seven (8%) participants who withdrew had\nlost more than 5% of their body weight compared with 53 (25%)\nwho completed the trial. Older participants were significantly\nmore likely to complete than younger ones (mean age 41.6 (9.9)\nv 36.8 (10.4); t= \u2212 3.7, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 2.3 to\n7.4). No differences in diet, centre, or sex were found between\nparticipants who completed or withdrew. Withdrawal in the con-\ntrol group (21; 35%) was mostly because participants did not\nwish to delay dieting.\nFollow-up at 12 months\nAt 12 months, 158 participants (54% of the original sample)\nreturned data; 29 had originally been allocated to the Atkins diet,\n33 to Weight Watchers, 33 to Slim-Fast, 35 to Rosemary Conley,\nTable 3 Intention to treat analysis of changes in cardiac risk factors in participants in the BBC diet trials allocated to different diet regimens.

Dieting behaviour had changed\nconsiderably: only 58 (45%) were still keeping to their originally\nallocated diets (nine to Atkins, 20 to Weight Watchers, nine to\nSlim-Fast, 20 to Rosemary Conley). Twenty five (19%) had\nswapped dietary programmes and 47 (36%) were following their\nown diet or exercise plan. More participants in the unsupported\nprogrammes (Atkins diet and Slim-Fast) withdrew than in the\nsupported programmes (\u00012 = 8.34, df = 3.0, P = 0.04). Partici-\npants in the control group who had switched to dieting (mean\nweight loss 6.37, SD 4.5 kg) also preferred group based\napproaches because just over half chose Weight Watchers.\nBecause so many participants changed diets (25% of men\nand 29% of women), we also analysed weight loss in participants\nwho had maintained the diet to which they were initially\nallocated (table 5). Statistical analysis is limited by sample size but\nindicates that weight rebound after the initial six months was\nhigher in the unsupported programmes; however, all diets\nresulted in a clinically useful weight loss of around 10% after 12\nmonths in participants who had persisted with the diet allocated.\nDiscussion\nClinically beneficial weight loss is possible through commercially\navailable strategies, and reduced blood pressure and waist\ncircumference accompany weight loss. The four different\napproaches were equally effective after six months. Reductions in\nweight and body fat were seen with the Atkins diet within the first\neight weeks of dieting, so that the large weight changes seen with\nlow carbohydrate diets are not caused by loss of body water\nalone. The Atkins diet had no detrimental effects on total choles-\nterol concentrations or renal function, although the overall safety\nof the diet was not tested.11\nThe range of absolute weight loss in participants who\ncompleted the study was wide. Importantly, we did not try to\nstandardise energy intake across the groups, so that the effects\nreflect the participants\u2019 interpretation of and compliance with\nthe diet allocated. However, the mean absolute weight loss of\naround 8 kg is comparable to other studies.12 13 Compliance with\neach diet varied greatly. Weight can be lost only by a sustained\nnegative balance of energy, so the degree of adherence to a diet\nwill predict success or failure if activity levels remain constant.\nMore information is needed to enable health professionals to\ndecide which dietary approach may suit their patients. Currently,\nwe cannot predict the dietary approach best suited to each per-\nson to lose weight and maintain weight loss in the longer term,\nbut it is clear that \u201cone size does not fit all.\u201d\nOur study was used to make the BBC series on diet trials,\nwhich featured a small number of people. Since motivation to\nmeet goal weights and patients\u2019 expectations of weight loss are\nkey determinants of success,14 participants may have been influ-\nenced by the media interest. Overall, around 5% of participants\nwere featured in the television programmes, and most\nparticipants knew that they would not be filmed within the first\nfew weeks. Excluding data from the 15 filmed participants had\nno effect on the overall statistical outcomes shown in this study.\nThe withdrawal rate was comparable to other longitudinal stud-\nies of weight loss.15\u201317\nNo dietary differences were apparent at six months, but\nbehaviour from six to 12 months points towards an advantage of\nprogrammes based on group support. The need for a \u201cquick fix\u201d\nand the relative lack of interest that people show in achieving\nmodest weight loss contribute to lack of adherence to most diets\nin the long term. People who had kept to their allocated diet lost\nabout 10% of their weight, despite some weight rebound, but\nsome regression to the mean effect was seen. These results pro-\nvide information on the \u201cbest effect\u201d that the most highly\nmotivated subjects may hope to achieve over one year.\nIn conclusion, commercial weight loss programmes can help\npeople with uncomplicated obesity. Our study provides data on\nhow much weight patients can expect to lose by dieting, and\nthese data could help practitioners in managing patients\u2019 some-\ntimes unrealistic expectations of weight loss targets. The benefits\nto health of modest weight loss and maintaining that loss over\nlong periods need to be emphasised.\nContributors: HT was the principal investigator and is guarantor.

Thus the\nmarginal cost of treating a pressure ulcer in hospital\nmay be small compared with the overall costs of hospi-\ntal treatment. In this sense our analysis reflects actual\npractice. Our assumption that participants remained\non the allocated surface over their entire hospital stay\nis conservative; in reality patients are moved on to\nstandard mattresses or higher specification surfaces if\ntheir risk of pressure ulcers changes. Given partici-\npants in the overlay group developed pressure ulcers\nearlier than those on the mattresses, this assumption\nwill have over-estimated the cost of the mattresses, thus\nstrengthening our conclusions.\nAlthough there was considerable uncertainty\naround the point estimates of mean health benefits and\ncosts (table 2), this should not result in large uncertainty\nfor decision makers since even for large willingness to\npay values (see bmj.com) the probability of the overlays\nbeing cost effective is only between 10% and 20%.11\nWe thank the clinical research nurses Helen Barrow, Caroline\nCooper, Fiona Corcoran, Patricia Hutchinson, Yvonne Meades,\nDawn Parkes, Fiona Smith, Ann Fotheringham, Sarah Gowland,\nAnn Warriner, Caroline Smith, Richard Buckland, Monica\nClark, Morag Doherty, Andrew Young, and Helen Marson; the\nparticipants and their relatives; ward nursing and medical staff\nof the six participating NHS trusts; and the independent trial\nsteering committee: Jenny Hewison (chair), David Machin, and\nGerben ter Riet.\nContributors: See bmj.com.\nFunding: UK Department of Health through its Health\nTechnology Assessment Programme.
