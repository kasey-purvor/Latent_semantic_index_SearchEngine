This study examines data on 50 mergers in the UK between 1989\nand 2002. The study confirms the finding from earlier studies of greater gains to\nshareholders in target than bidding companies, but does not find evidence supporting\noverall loss of shareholder value to target company shareholders when a merger is\nprohibited. It finds evidence that when the regulatory regime is stable and well\nunderstood the capital market behaves efficiently in response to new information.\nHowever, for a sub group of the mergers involving companies with a new regulatory\nregime, of which industry and the market had little or no experience with respect to\nmergers, the capital market operated less efficiently.\nKey words: mergers, competition policy, shareholder value, event study, privatised\nindustries.\n3Introduction\nPrevious studies have pointed to possible significant costs to the economy arising\nfrom state regulation (for a review see Blundell and Robinson, 2000). These costs take\nthe form of the administrative costs of operating the regulatory system and the\ncompliance costs to the company resulting from a competition inquiry in the form of\nlegal and other advisory expenses and management time. However, these costs can be\nexpected to be de minimis in relation to a company\u2019s value; typically such costs in the\nUK amount per merger to between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a32m. Hence, they are not the subject\nof this paper. A potentially much more important impact on shareholder value will\nresult from the City revaluing the share price during an inquiry. Some previous\nstudies have found that competition regimes can lead through share price movements\nto substantial losses to shareholders. This paper considers the impact of UK\ncompetition policy on shareholder value between 1989 and 2002. The purpose of the\npaper is not to measure the wider social welfare effects of competition policy, which\nwould take into account the impact on consumers, suppliers, employees etc, but rather\nto concentrate on shareholder value, which is one part of social welfare. The effect of\ncompetition policy on shareholder value is an important subject for managers, who\nneed to manage shareholder expectations during a competition inquiry, and investors.\nThe UK introduced its competition regime in 1948 with the establishment of the\nMonopolies Commission. In 1965 its remit was widened to inquire into mergers as\nwell as monopoly markets (Wilks, 1999). Under the Competition Act of 1998, the\nMonopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) became the Competition Commission\n(CC) and the powers of the Commission and the government department responsible\nfor administering competition law, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), were amended.\nUnder the Enterprise Act 2002 the CC\u2019s decisions became determinative, that is to say\nthey became final subject only to legal appeal. Previously the CC and before it the\nMMC had made recommendations to the Minister. In addition, the Act changed the\ntest for mergers from \u201cthe public interest\u201d (under Section 84 of the Fair Trading Act\n1973) to \u201ca substantial lessening of competition\u201d test. In practice, however, since the\n41980s the Commission\u2019s reports have tended to concentrate upon a merger\u2019s\ncompetitive effects.1\nThe UK has a long-standing competition regime. In principle, over time the capital\nmarket should have built up experience of competition policy in the UK, allowing it to\npredict with some degree of confidence the likelihood of a referral to the MMC\/CC\nand the MMC\/CC\u2019s decision in the case of any referred merger. A reasonably stable\nand predictable competition regime should reduce distorting effects on share prices\nresulting from unexpected decisions by the competition authorities. Like a good tax\nsystem, a competition regime should achieve its goals, of preventing a lessening of\ncompetition, while minimising the costs, including costs imposed through share price\nmovements in the stock market. Hence, in this paper we consider the impact on\nshareholder value of mergers referred to the MMC\/CC between 1989 and 2002. This\nperiod was chosen because certain earlier studies, discussed below, had looked at\ncompetition policy and shareholder value up until the early 1990s and because the\ncompetition regime in the UK was changed substantially by the 2002 Enterprise Act,\nwhich took effect from June 2003.\nDuring the study period of 1989-2002 the legal framework of competition regulation\nwas based on the Fair Trading Act 1973 modified through the Competition Acts 1980\nand 1998. However these did not change the concepts of qualifying mergers or the\n\u201cpublic interest\u201d test. The market share threshold for qualifying cases has remained\nconstant at 25% since 1973, and the asset size threshold was \u00a330m from 1984, rising\nto \u00a370m in 1994. Hence there was a period of stability in the legislative framework\ngoverning competition regulation during the period 1989-2002. This regime had also\nexisted for 15 years by the start of the study period, encompassing over 3200\nqualifying cases of which 98 cases were referred for inquiry. As a result, the UK\ncompetition regime should have been a reasonably certain and well-understood\nregime during the study period.\n1 One of the authors is a Member of the Competition Commission. However, all comments made in\nthis paper are made in a personal capacity. We would like to thank two referees and Sudi Sudarsanam ,\nPaul Geroski and participants of a special session on mergers and acquisitions at the British Academy\nof Management Conference in September 2004, for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this\npaper.\n5The study period, however, contains a number of merger cases involving companies\nfrom industries in which new, sector-specific regulators were created, namely in\nwater, electricity and telecommunications. The regulatory regimes for these industries\nwere new, and the role of the CC\/MMC had been modified to work with the industry\nspecific regulators on competition issues relating to these industries. Therefore,\nmerger cases involving companies from these industries may not have benefited to the\nsame degree from regime stability and being well understood. One new aspect of their\nregulation was the roles played by the two regulators \u2013 the CC\/MMC and the sector-\nspecific regulators, such as OFTEL - and how far their responsibilities intertwined and\noverlapped. In the discussion below, for convenience, we refer to these industries as\n\u2018privatised industries\u2019, although in some cases, while subject to dual regulation, the\nfirms concerned had not been privatised. Also, a number of the privatised industries\nhad large numbers of small shareholders and it is possible that this may have impacted\non the way the stock market responded to mergers.\nThe prime focus of the research is to understand any cost to shareholders arising from\nshare price movements when companies desire to merge and the merger leads to a\nformal competition inquiry. It is therefore in the tradition of earlier studies, especially\nby Wier (1983), Franks and Harris (1993) and Forbes (1994). Consistent with the\nusage in competition policy, we use the term merger to include both friendly and\nhostile takeover bids.\nIn the case of any merger the view the capital market takes about the likelihood of a\ncompetition inquiry and the likely decision of the MMC\/CC will be reflected in the\nshare price, in addition to any view taken about the intrinsic value of the merger itself.\nWe study the mergers from the time they are publicly announced, encompassing the\ntime from the announcement of the merger to a decision by the government to refer\nthe merger to the MMC\/CC for inquiry. The period ends when a decision is made by\nthe government following the MMC\/CC findings as to whether the merger should be\nprohibited or not, perhaps subject to behavioural or structural remedies, or when the\nmerger is abandoned.2\n2 Before 2003 the MMC (later CC) reported to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industries, who had\ndiscretion not to accept the Commission\u2019s recommendation in the case of an adverse finding.\n6While the capital market cannot be expected to predict the outcome of each stage of\nthe inquiry process with perfect accuracy, the experience of investors should lead\nthem to assess the likely outcomes for each merger. The capital market will form a\ncollective view of the probability of referral to the Commission and concerning the\nCommission\u2019s final decision. Some evidence discussed below suggests that a\ncompetition regulator\u2019s decisions may be unexpected or differ from those anticipated\nby the capital market, but given rational expectations by investors, there should be no\ntendency towards systematic bias in the capital market\u2019s judgement. Competition\nregimes facing political interference might well be prone to an unexpected outcome,\nalthough in the UK the MMC\/CC has operated with a high degree of independence\n(Wilks, 1999). Investors may also be expected to find it more difficult to forecast\noutcomes where mergers relate to industries where there is little or no track record of\nmergers or where there is a greater likelihood of non-competition issues influencing a\nregulator\u2019s decision. Good examples in the UK of the former are the privatised\nutilities, notably water and electricity, and of the latter the communications sector,\nwhere the government takes a particular interest in merger outcomes because of the\npossible effects on diversity in the media. In the 1990s these sectors were subject to a\nnumber of merger bids.\nThe paper contributes to an understanding of the costs of regulation and more\nespecially competition policy. Whether competition policy increases social welfare\ndepends on the improvements in economic efficiency it achieves, compared with its\nadministrative and compliance costs including the impact on shareholder returns. The\nstudy\u2019s conclusions are also consistent with the importance for public policy of\nhaving a consistent and predictable competition policy. This is an important finding\ngiven that the number of countries with competition laws has increased from around\n30 to over 90 in the last ten years (Singh, 2002). Where countries introduce new\ncompetition laws, they should expect that the impact of a competition inquiry on\nshareholder value may be greater than we find for the UK, because investors will lack\nexperience of how the competition law is to be applied and therefore larger abnormal\nreturns (both positive and negative) are to be expected. The next two sections of the\npaper review the existing literature in the field and detail the research method. The\nempirical results are then presented and discussed. The paper concludes by\nsummarising the main findings and the contribution of the research to an\n7understanding of the relationship between competition policy and shareholder value.\nDirections for future research are also highlighted.\nLiterature review\nMost of the research into mergers has concentrated upon the effects on firm\nperformance, measured mainly in terms of profitability, productivity and the impact\non share prices. Profitability studies tend to show negative effects from mergers,\nwhile productivity and event studies tend to show more positive effects. For example,\nMeeks (1977) studied the effects of mergers in the UK on firm profitability. Meeks\nconcluded that between a half and two-thirds of the firms in his UK sample suffered a\nfall in profits after a merger. Sirower (1997) studied stock market prices in US\nmergers. He found strong support for a negative relationship between the level of\npremium paid and the acquiring firms\u2019 performance. A flow of studies since has\nproduced the following conclusions. While around a half or more of mergers fail to\nachieve the expected economic synergies, shareholders in target firms are likely to\nbenefit more than shareholders in bidding firms (for a review of the earlier literature,\nsee Chiplin and Wright, 1988, pp. 66-73, for later studies, see Sirower, 1997,\nAppendix A, pp. 145-166). This is because bidders may overestimate the economic\ngains from a merger and because of the level of premium they pay to shareholders in\nthe target firm to win their acceptance of the takeover bid. Other studies have begun\nto look at mergers in terms of management and organisational changes, with a view to\npredicting the type of internal restructuring that should take place post merger if\neconomic gains are to be maximised (for a review of this literature, see Schweiger and\nGoulet, 2000). By contrast, there seems to have been much less research into the\ninteraction between competition policy and the economic consequences of mergers.\nImportant exceptions are the studies by Eckbo (1983), Stillman (1983), Wier (1983),\nFranks and Harris (1993), Forbes (1994), Brady and Feinberg (2000), Aktas, de Bodt\nand Roll (2001), and Duso, Nevan and Roeller (2003), which we now review.\nIn 1983 Eckbo carried out event studies on a sample of 259 horizontal and vertical\nmergers in the USA, of which 79 were challenged by the government\u2019s anti-trust\n8agencies. He found that there was no statistical evidence from rival company share\nprice movements to support a collusive behaviour hypothesis for horizontal mergers.\nFrom this he concluded that horizontal mergers challenged by regulators had been\nbased on cost saving efficiencies and not market power, and they were no more\ndamaging to competition than vertical mergers. In the same year Stillman (1983)\ncarried out a similar study of 11 horizontal mergers involving US companies between\n1964 and 1972 which were challenged by the antitrust enforcement agencies. His\nresults were consistent with those of Eckbo (1983). Both found a lack of statistical\nevidence to support referral to the anti-trust authorities on competition grounds.\nResearch closer to our study is that by Wier (1983). Wier looked at the costs of\ndefending mergers challenged by the US anti-trust enforcement agencies. Again using\nevent studies, she considered the effects on market capitalisation measured by\nabnormal returns at key events in the regulatory process. Her finding was that, on\naverage, merger complaint announcements occasion abnormal losses and large costs\nare born by shareholders of target firms if proposed mergers are cancelled. Wealth\ngains earned at the time of the bid announcement were cancelled out by losses by the\ntime the competition inquiry ended. But she concluded that the effects on share prices\nwill also be influenced by the ability of investors to accurately predict competition\npolicy outcomes.\nThe relevant studies for the UK are those by Franks and Harris (1993) and Forbes\n(1994). Using event studies and data from a sample of 159 UK mergers referred to the\nMMC between 1965 and 1990, Franks and Harris (1993) examined evidence of\nshareholder value changes to bidder and target companies in mergers. They identified\nsubstantial losses to shareholders when the MMC rejected merger bids. In addition,\nthey found that negative value returns occurred on referral and on the announcement\nof an adverse public interest finding by the MMC. Announcement of a favourable\ndecision had a small positive effect. The value effects were greater and statistically\nsignificant for the target company, while the bidder company returns were smaller and\nstatistically insignificant. They also found that a MMC rejection of a merger led to a\nsubstantial reduction in the gains to the target company\u2019s shareholders that had been\nrecorded at the date of the merger bid.\n9Forbes (1994) investigated the value impact of MMC references using event studies\nof 53 mergers in the period 1976 to 1990, although for bidding companies only.\nAbnormal returns were calculated for the initial announcement of the merger,\nannouncement of referral to the MMC by the Minister, and the Commission\u2019s\ndecision. The value effects were found to be broadly consistent with those in Franks\nand Harris (1993). Bidder returns were again small and not statistically significant.\nMore recently there has been an attempt to look at the impact on shareholder value of\nEU competition regulation. Brady and Feinberg (2000) examined 20 mergers from\n1991 to 1995 subjected to EU competition investigation, after the introduction of the\nEU\u2019s merger regulations in 1990. This was the first time that the EU had taken formal\npowers to challenge mergers. They looked for evidence of regime effects (relating to\ncases grouped by EU member state and by industry sectors) and individual case\neffects of regulatory decisions on shareholder value. They found that the regime\neffects were weak. However, for individual cases enforcement of the merger\nregulations could have a substantial effect on individual company share prices. They\nalso discovered that findings by the European Commission of \u201cserious doubts\u201d or the\nannouncement of a \u201csuspension\u201d decision adversely affected the share price. In this\ncase, the fact that investors seem to have had difficulty predicting inquiry outcomes,\nas reflected in share price movements, probably related to the fact that the merger\nregime in the EU was new. Another study, by Aktas, de Bodt and Roll (2001),\nlooking at whether EU competition policy was biased against mergers involving non-\nEU firms, found clear confirmation that investors anticipate regulatory intervention.\nHence, abnormal returns around the bid announcement date must be interpreted in the\nlight of the probability and cost of regulatory intervention. Duso, Nevan and Roeller\n(2003) discovered a similar effect on competitors\u2019 share prices, drawing on the\nmethod proposed by Eckbo (1983) and Stillman (1983). They posited an anti-\ncompetitive merger would reduce competitive market forces within an industry and\nreduce downward pressure on prices and profit margins, which would be viewed\npositively by industry investors resulting in increased share prices for competitors.\nHence a positive movement in competitors\u2019 share prices is interpreted as a view in the\ncapital market that the merger is anti-competitive. From this they identified instances\nwhere the European Commission\u2019s findings on mergers may have been in error.\n10\nThe existing literature suggests, therefore, that alongside the costs to shareholders of\nfirms defending anti-trust inquiries, in terms of professional fees and management\nresources, costs may be imposed on shareholders by the uncertainty of regulatory\noutcomes. In this paper we consider whether there is evidence since 1989 to support\nthe findings of Wier (1983), Franks and Harris (1993) and Forbes (1994). All three\nobserved a cost to shareholders of companies going through either the US and UK\ncompetition regulation processes. This cost arose from abnormal losses incurred on\ndecision announcements, and in particular shareholders of target companies suffered a\nsignificant loss when an acquisition was prevented. We also consider whether there\nare any groupings of firms where stock market prices may have reacted in a different\nway to competition policy decisions than share prices in other mergers.\nResearch Method\nIn this paper event study techniques are used to examine 50 merger cases referred to\nthe MMC\/CC between 1989 and 2002. The mergers are listed in table 1 and were\nchosen from the Competition Commission\u2019s (incorporating the MMC\u2019s) list of merger\ncases on the basis of both bidder and target companies being listed on a public stock\nexchange for at least one year before the announcement of the bid3. Dates for events\nwere found from company, Competition Commission and Stock Exchange press\nreleases and from The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal. Event dates were\nconfirmed from at least two sources if the original press releases were not available.\nDaily company share prices and market indices were obtained from DataStream. The\nfinal column of table 1 indicates those companies falling into the \u2018privatised\nindustries\u2019 grouping (denoted by letter P). The remaining mergers fall into the \u2018other\nindustries\u2019 category of the analysis. The table also shows the merger outcome, the\nregulatory decision by the competition authorities and whether the merger involved\nany competitive bidding; all of this data are used in the analysis below.\n3 Between 1989 and 2002 a total of 156 merger cases were referred to CC\/MMC. Of these, in 50 cases\nboth target and bidder companies were listed on stock exchanges, allowing analysis using event study\nmethods in this research.\n11\n(Table 1 here)\nA market model was estimated using OLS regression comparing each company\u2019s\ndaily share price changes (bidder and target) against changes in a major index for the\nstock exchange on which the companies were quoted (i.e. FTSE All Share index for\nUK listed companies). The model estimation period was from one calendar year\nbefore the bid announcement to two days before the final event. The final event was\neither the date of the completion of the merger deal in the Stock Market (either formal\nclose of deal or the deal declared unconditional) or abandonment or prohibition of the\nbid. The estimation period was chosen so that the market model would reflect the\nvariable and extended period between the initial bid and the final event, which can be\nup to a year in some cases. Event windows were excluded from the estimation of the\nmarket model. In this study the event windows were set at three days because this\nperiod should encompass immediate lead and lag effects4, while restricting the\npossibility of including share price changes resulting from events exogenous to the\nregulatory process. Setting a longer event window risks introducing effects on the\nshare price that are independent of the announcement, including so-called\n\u201cconfounding\u201d events in event studies.\nFor each bidder and target company the market model was estimated as follows:\nitmtimiit RR \uf065\uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nwhere itR represents the return on security i on day t, i\uf061 is a constant, mtR represents\nthe return on the market portfolio for day t, im\uf062 is the regression coefficient of the\nrelationship between security i and the market index, and it\uf065 represents a random\nerror term. Dummy values were used to remove event window days from the\nestimation regression.5 The abnormal return is the difference between the actual return\nand the expected return, and for any security, i, at time t, ARit, is:\n\uf028 \uf029mtimiitit RRAR \uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n4 To consider the effect of a regulatory or bid announcement on the share price on the day of the\nannouncement only would exclude any effect on share prices resulting from lead effects (rumours,\nstock market anticipation of the announcement content) and lag effects (time for the market to\nassimilate the full likely effect on the share price of the announcement).\n5 Between the initial bid and the final event there are a number of event windows. These are excluded\nfrom the estimation data for the market model covering the period from one year before the initial bid\nto two days before the final event.\n12\nThe cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for event windows and the total bid was\ncalculated by summing the daily abnormal returns:\n\uf0e5\uf03d\nT\nitiT ARCAR\n0\nwhere CARiT is the cumulative abnormal return for security i over event window T.\nAverage cumulative abnormal returns (ACAR) across n firms is:\nn\nCAR\nACAR\nn\ni\nit\uf0e5\n\uf03d\uf03d 1\nAll event windows were examined for confounding events occurring around the event\nperiod. In most cases event windows were clear of other potentially price sensitive\nannouncements. In some cases, for example where a company was involved in\nmultiple bids or other major company activities were ongoing, events sometimes\noverlapped. In such cases a judgement was made on the basis of whether the\noverlapping event was related to the merger being examined or not. If it was\nconsidered to be related, the event would be included in the abnormal return\ncalculation, otherwise it was excluded.\nThe statistical significance testing for the ARs and CARs is discussed in depth in\nSalinger (1992), which shows the variance of the CAR is given by:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nm\nm\nT\nm\nit rUVar\nr\nT\nr\nT\nU\nT\nTCARVar\n2\n0\n2 1\uf073\nwhere T and U are the lengths of the event window and estimation periods\nrespectively, 2\uf073 is the variance of it\uf065 , mr and \uf028 \uf029mrVar are the mean and variance of\nthe market return over the estimation period, and Tmr 0 is the continuously compounded\nmarket return over the event window.\n13\nThe test statistic used is t = CAR\/ Var (CAR). When the degrees of freedom are large\n(e.g. greater than 200) this approximates to a normal distribution and Ztv \uf03d\uf0a5\uf0ae , where\nv is the degrees of freedom.\nWhen n firms are averaged the test statistic for the averaged group is calculated as:\nn\nZ\nZ\nn\ni\ni\nACAR\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\uf03d 1 ,\nwhere iZ is the Z statistic for individual firms, and n is the number of firms in the\ngroup.\nIn some cases competitive bids for the same target were considered by the MMC\/CC.\nThese may have been on the basis of either one or both bidders being referred to the\nCommission. In all cases of multiple bidders, separate cases were analysed for each\nbidder.\nFigure 1 summarises the process and the relevant decision points in UK competition\npolicy and table 2 lists the possible outcomes from a referral. As a merger case\nprogresses through the process, it is to be expected that the stock market takes a view\non the probability of possible regulatory outcomes, drawing on investors\u2019 and their\nadvisers\u2019 knowledge of competition law, past regulatory experience and case specifics\n(including expert opinion, media comment, rumours, etc). For example, the grounds\non which a merger might be referred are covered by legislation and are well known\nand past decisions of the MMC\/CC are public knowledge. Table 3 summarises the\nmerger activity between 1989 and 2002. Of a total of 9872 bids reported to the OFT,\n3165 met the Fair Trading Act qualifying terms (either over 25% of market share for\nthe combination or target assets greater than the prevailing limit of \u00a330m, later raised\nto \u00a370m). The OFT referred a total of 156 cases for investigation by the MMC\/CC, of\nwhich 22 were subsequently prohibited outright after the Commission\u2019s inquiry.\n(Figure 1 and Tables 2 and 3 here.)\n14\nThe starting point for the process is the announcement of the merger bid. In a simple\ncase, the bidding company will usually offer to buy the target at a premium over the\nmarket price prevailing just before the bid announcement. The market will respond,\nre-valuing bidder and target companies based on the expected economic effects of the\nmerger and the probable outcome of the bid. As part of the process, the City will take\naccount of the possibility of referral to the MMC\/CC and will factor in an estimation\nof the probable outcome of an inquiry. After referral, as a case moves through the\ninquiry process the market will re-evaluate the merging companies at each step of the\nprocess as possible outcomes turn into certainties; for example, the probability of an\nadverse finding becomes 1 when the MMC\/CC\u2019s decision is published (prior to that\nthe probability lies in the range >0 to <1). If the merger is laid aside6 or abandoned by\nthe companies involved part way through the process, the market will also re-value\nthe companies based on this outcome. In the analysis below, the event study is based\non daily percentage share price changes for the companies, allowing a direct\ncomparison with the earlier work by Wier (1983), Franks and Harris (1993) and\nForbes (1994), reviewed above.\nIf the regulatory regime is consistent and well understood by investors, efficient\nmarket behaviour can be expected to predominate. Investors will estimate the future\nvalue of the bidder and target companies, taking account of the nature of the proposed\nmerger deal and the regulatory uncertainty that surrounds the merger. Efficient market\nbehaviour in this discussion is intended to mean prices will respond quickly to new\ninformation and be linked to the fundamental value implicit in the announcement or\nregulatory \u201cevent\u201d. The fundamental value can be considered to be the NPV of the\nbenefit (or detriment) arising from the event.\nBy contrast, the regulatory regime may not be so predictable if it is new or its legal\nframework undergoes significant changes, as in the study by Brady and Feinberg\n(2000) of European merger policy reviewed above. Newness and changes are\naccompanied by a lack of case history, making it more difficult for investors to predict\naccurately competition authority behaviour. In this situation, investors have more\n6 \u201cLaid aside\u201d is the term used to describe MMC\/CC inquiries that are stopped because the bidding\nparty withdraws its bid after referral to the MMC\/CC. The inquiries are technically \u201claid aside\u201d and not\nabandoned because they are resurrected if the bid is later renewed.\n15\ndifficulty in assessing the possible regulatory outcome and the impact on the\nfundamental value of the events announced. In this climate of increased uncertainty,\ninvestors may turn to rumour, belief-based valuations or herd instinct, which may not\nbe strongly linked to fundamental value.\nThere is ongoing debate about whether capital markets behave efficiently or not. A\nconsiderable amount of work has taken place to support the Efficient Market\nHypothesis (EMH), as discussed in Fama (1969, 1970, 1991, and 1998). However,\nthere has also been a strong challenge to the EMH view in the form of a development\nof an understanding of inefficient markets and behavioural finance. An overview of\nthe subject area is given in Shiller (1989, 2001) and in Schleifer (2000). In this\nliterature, the EMH does not appear to offer an adequate explanation of some\ncommonly observed features of stock markets, particularly market volatility and the\nphenomenon of market bubbles, when prices become detached from the underlying\nfundamental values for a period before falling back. Our analysis simply requires that\nshare prices reflect investors\u2019 current views of competition policy outcomes.\nThe study period in this paper - 1989 to 2002 - represents a period when the UK\ncompetition regime was relatively stable and well understood. Therefore, we would\nexpect evidence in the mergers studied to support the proposition that the market\nbehaved efficiently. However, there is a sub-set of the cases in the study that includes\nnewly privatised industries, where the regulatory regime was new and involved\nsector-specific industry regulators as well as the MMC\/CC. In these industries the\nOFT, the MMC\/CC and the industry regulators could all play a part in deciding the\noutcome of any proposed merger. These \u2018privatisation\u2019 merger cases therefore entered\nrelatively untested territory regarding the inter-working between industry regulators\nand the competition regulator in the study period. Another cause of additional\nuncertainty involved how structural changes in the privatised industries resulting from\nmergers might be viewed by government and to what degree government might\nintervene in competition decisions, for example by bringing pressure to bear on the\nsector regulators. For these reasons, the \u2018privatisation\u2019 sub-sample can be considered\nto be covered by a new regulatory regime with no or very little case history. Greater\ndifficulty on the part of investors in understanding and valuing any merger events\nmight therefore be expected and so we might expect to find some evidence of\n16\ndifferent market behaviour in this sub group. A further factor that might have\nimpacted on the way the stock market responded to some mergers lies in the large\nnumbers of small shareholders who purchased shares in privatised companies at the\ntime of their privatisation. Such shareholders may lack the understanding of\ncompetition law and practice held by more seasoned investors and those with access\nto specialist advice.\nTo test for such effects, for part of the analysis the merger cases studied were split\ninto two sub-groupings. The first contains the cases involving companies in what we\nterm the \u2018privatised industries\u2019 and the second contains all the other merger cases\nstudied, which is termed the \u2018other industries\u2019 panel. The propositions to be tested\nrelate to how well market prices reflect the underlying value of the merger events on\nthe companies, and are as follows.\nProposition 1. In merger cases where the deal is prohibited by the regulator or\nabandoned by the companies, the value change arising from bid specific events to the\ntarget company, from bid announcement to bid abandoned, is expected to be zero.\nThis proposition follows from the fact that, leaving aside the de minimis costs to\ncompanies (in relation to their values) of taking part in MMC\/CC inquiries, because\nthe merger is not completed the competition regime should have no effect on the\nfundamental value of companies, as reflected in their share prices. In effect, following\nthe failed merger the fundamental value of the target company is restored to what it\nwas immediately before the bid (ignoring, of course, other factors impacting on the\nshare price since the bid was announced unrelated to the bid, such as tax changes or\nchanges in the competitive environment). This is because any economic advantages\nresulting from the merger factored into the share price by investors in the target\ncompany at the time of the merger bid is removed once the bid is prevented or\nabandoned.7\n7 A referee pointed out, correctly, that it is possible that because a merger bid puts a firm \u2018in play\u2019 by\nattracting attention to it as a potential takeover target the management may be \u2018shaken up\u2019 and the City\nmay expect further bids. If such considerations affect the share price after a prohibition or abandonment\nof the original bid, then the proposition might not hold true. In this case, the abnormal return results\nwill not be consistent with the proposition. In fact, our results are generally consistent with the\nproposition except for the \u2018privatised\u2019 industries, where other issues seem to impact on the way the\nshare prices behave.\n17\nProposition 2. In merger cases where the deal is allowed (but not conditionally\nallowed) the value change arising from bid specific events to the target company from\nbid to deal close is greater than zero.\nThis proposition is valid because the share prices of target companies tend to rise in\nmerger bids due to the bid premium required to induce investors to sell their shares in\nthe target to the bidder. When the merger is permitted by the competition authorities,\nthis gain is not offset by a counter move in the share price (as in the case of prohibited\nand abandoned bids).\nBoth propositions are applied to the target companies only for two reasons. Firstly the\nvalue of the bid to target company shareholders is driven by the bid premium and is\nusually positive in value. When the bid is withdrawn due to prohibition or\nabandonment, the value to target company shareholders disappears. This argument\ndoes not apply to the bidder company where the value to its shareholders is based on\nthe difference between benefits from the bid and the cost of the bid including the\npremium paid, as viewed by the capital markets. This may be positive, negative or\nzero depending on the circumstances and the views taken (Sirower, 1997). Secondly\ntarget company returns are larger and statistically more significant than returns for\nbidder companies.\nThe Empirical Results\nFirstly we establish the abnormal returns arising in each of the 50 merger cases\nstudied between 1989 and 2002. These results are presented in Table 4. We then test\nfor the two Propositions relating market behaviour. These results are presented in\nTables 5 and 6.\nIn section A of table 4 the abnormal return results for all of the mergers studied are\nsummarised, irrespective of the OFT decision on a referral and the outcome of a\nMMC\/CC inquiry. As can be seen, target company returns were greater than those for\nbidder companies and returns for the \u201cother industries\u201d group were greater than for\nthe \u201cprivatised industries\u201d group. Taking all the cases together, a small positive but\n18\nstatistically non-significant overall gain to shareholders of 1.0% for the bidder\ncompanies compares to a much larger and statistically significant gain of 14.3% for\nshareholders of the target companies. The finding that target company shareholders\nbenefit most during mergers is consistent with much of the earlier merger literature\n(Sudarsanam, 2003, chapter 4).\n(Table 4 here.)\nComparing industry groupings, section A of table 4 also shows that the overall results\nfor bidder company cases in the \u2018privatised industries\u2019 grouping is a small loss (-\n2.9%), which is statistically significant at the 1% level, compared to a small but not\nstatistically significant gain of 2.2% in the \u2018other industries\u2019 grouping. By comparison\ntarget companies in both groups made significant positive returns of 8.3% and 16.2%\nfor the \u2018privatised\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 groups, respectively (both statistically significant at the\n1% level).\nIn section B of table 4 cases are grouped by the regulatory decisions of the OFT\n(\u201cwaived through\u201d) and MMC\/CC (the other cases considered by the OFT, i.e. which\nwere referred to the MMC\/CC, and were then later \u201callowed\u201d, \u201cconditionally\nallowed\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d). Also, the results when mergers were \u201claid aside\u201d\n(abandoned) are included. Again target companies do better than bidders, irrespective\nof the inquiry decision. For bidders, taking all cases together, conditionally allowed\ncases showed the greatest return (7.1%) while prohibited cases showed the lowest (-\n6.7%), both being statistically significant. Overall bidder returns for other outcomes\nwere small (-1.8% to 1.4%) and not statistically significant. For target companies,\nreturns were greater than for bidder companies and statistically significant for all\ndecisions except laid aside cases. Highest returns for target companies were for\nallowed cases (20.7%) and the least was for prohibited cases (4.8%). Not surprisingly,\nprohibited outcomes gave the worst returns for both bidder and target companies, and\nthe pattern was repeated when cases were divided into industry groups.\nParticularly interesting are the abnormal returns where target companies are from\nwhat we refer to as \u2018privatised\u2019 (sector specific regulated) industries. Where a\nprohibition decision was announced following a MMC\/CC inquiry, companies in\n19\nthese industries displayed the greatest negative abnormal returns of any decision\nannouncement. Target companies in privatised industries returned a large statistically\nsignificant 12.6% loss, compared to a 0.4% (non-significant) gain in the case of\nprohibition announcements for target companies in the \u2018other industries\u2019 group (see\ntable 4, section B, prohibited results, \u201cDecision CAR\u201d). The finding of a negative\nabnormal return for target companies on the announcement of a merger prohibition\ndecision broadly agrees with the findings in the studies by Wier (1983), Franks and\nHarris (1993) and Forbes (1994).\nHowever, a finding of negative returns on the announcement of a prohibition decision\ndoes not alone provide a sufficiently accurate picture of the overall effects of a\ncompetition inquiry. When we consider the overall return for target companies in\ncases with prohibited decisions, the return is 4.8% and this is made up of a statistically\nsignificant 5.4% return for the privatised industry group of firms and a 3.2% non-\nsignificant return for the \u2018other industries\u2019 category (table 4, section B, prohibited\nresults, \u201cOverall CAR\u201d). This finding is therefore greatly influenced by the privatised\nindustry cases and is not consistent with the results in Wier (1983). She found an\nabnormal loss to shareholders of target companies due to prohibition resulting from\ncompetition inquiries and argued that the result is an additional cost of defending an\nanti-trust action in addition to normal legal and professional costs incurred. However\nour study agrees with Franks and Harris (1993), finding a gain to target company\nshareholders in prohibited cases over the whole bid and inquiry period. Our study\nsuggests that there is no additional cost to target company shareholders when the\nregulatory process is taken as a whole, namely from announcement of a merger bid,\nthrough referral to the MMC\/CC, to the inquiry decision prohibiting the merger.\nEspecially when the privatised industry cases are excluded, the abnormal return is\nsmall and not statistically significant.\nBy contrast, bidder company shareholders experienced a significant loss in prohibited\ncases. Table 4 section B \u201cprohibited\u201d shows the overall bidder loss of -6.7% was\nexperienced equally in both the \u201cprivatised\u201d and \u201cother\u201d industry groups (-6.5% and -\n7.1% respectively), all abnormal returns are statistically significant at the 5% level or\nbetter. Interestingly, this overall loss to bidder company shareholders in prohibited\n20\ncases agrees with the figure of -6% in Franks and Harris (1993), though their result\nwas not statistically significant.\nOther results in table 4 covering decisions to allow the mergers to proceed, that is to\nsay the \u201callowed\u201d, \u201cconditionally allowed\u201d and \u201cwaived through\u201d results, are also of\ninterest. The abnormal returns to bidder and target companies show slightly different\npatterns. In the case of all mergers (privatised and \u2018other industries\u2019 together), for\ntarget companies the greatest returns were where there was an \u201callowed\u201d decision\n(20.7%). Bidder returns were highest for \u201cconditionally allowed\u201d cases (7.1%), the\ntwo other decision groups show only small, statistically non significant returns. Again\nthis is in broad agreement with Franks and Harris (1993) which showed cases allowed\nto proceed having returns for target and bidder companies of 38% and 6%,\nrespectively, over the whole bid and inquiry period.\nWhile table 4 shows some differences between the returns for \u201cprivatised\u201d and\n\u201cother\u201d industries, it is not possible to examine if market mispricing, due to a\nreduction of market efficiency, was a factor in those differences. Therefore, our study\nexamines this directly by testing target companies returns against Propositions 1 and 2\ndescribed earlier. Table 5 shows the results of for the direct tests of Propositions 1 and\n2.\nIn these tests any abnormal return results not significant at the 5% level (two tailed)\nare interpreted as being equivalent to zero, in an attempt to ensure that any differences\nwe find are statistically robust. The cases are again grouped into \u2018privatised\u2019 and\n\u2018other industries\u2019 categories. It can be seen that there is a much higher number of\ncases with a false result in the \u2018privatised\u2019 group. In order to test if the difference\nbetween the two industry groups is statistically significant, the results in table 5 are\nsummarised in a contingency table, table 6. Applying Fisher\u2019s exact test to the\ncontingency table indicates the difference between the two groups is statistically\nsignificant at the 10% level. From this finding we can conclude that the market\nbehaviour in the \u2018others\u2019 grouping is more consistent with our Propositions, based on\nan efficient, well-informed capital market responding to merger inquiries, than is the\ncase for the \u2018privatised\u2019 group of mergers.\n21\nMerger cases involving \u2018privatised\u2019 industries occurred during the 1990s; in\nparticular, there were three proposed mergers in both the water industry8 and in the\nelectricity sector and two in communications. During this period investors\u2019 experience\nof how the competition authorities would respond to mergers in these sectors\nremained limited because there were few, if any, previous cases from which to draw\nlessons. It is to be expected, therefore, that investors would have had more difficulty\nin accurately assessing the likely impact of regulatory outcomes at each stage of the\nmergers involving water, electricity and communications companies. Moreover, the\ncommunications, water and electricity industries had their own, additional, sector-\nspecific regulators, which can be expected to have added to regulatory uncertainty at\nthe time of mergers. The sector regulators police competition policy alongside the\nMMC\/CC and are important in recommending referrals of mergers to the MMC\/CC.\nAfter referral they provide evidence to the Commission. The sector-specific regulators\nwere mainly young in the 1990s9 and at the time no one knew how far the regulators\nwould allow the industrial structure established in water and electricity at privatisation\nto be changed. The government also took a special interest in mergers involving\ncommunications companies because of concerns about media ownership. Our\nfindings are consistent with the view that less efficient market pricing of shares may\nhave occurred in the case of mergers in these sectors as views in the stock market\nchanged about the possible outcomes while the regulatory process relating to mergers\nwas underway.\nA further factor may have influenced market behaviour, which relates to the degree of\nnon-institutional shareholding in privatised companies. At privatisation, the\ngovernment had an objective of increasing the number of private shareholders in the\nUK and used the flotation of former state-owned industries to help achieve this aim. A\nlarge degree of equity held by individuals may have reduced the effectiveness of\narbitrage traders in the capital market. At the same time, the behaviour of private\nshareholders may have been driven more by shareholder sentiment than by rational\ndecisions based on fundamental value. With a combination of these factors we might\nexpect a high degree of non-institutional shareholding to reduce market efficiency, in\n8 One of which was conditionally allowed and is therefore not included in table 5.\n9 The communications sector now has one regulator in the UK, Ofcom. In the 1980s and 1990s\ntelecommunications had a new regulator, Oftel, while broadcasting and certain other fields of\ncommunications had their own dedicated regulators with longer histories.\n22\nthe sense of share prices being less linked to the underlying economic value brought\nabout by the proposed mergers..\nConclusions and Discussion\nCompetition policy can be expected to impact on shareholder value during each stage\nof a merger inquiry process. Investors can be expected to reassess the probable final\noutcome of the inquiry at each step in the process, repeatedly revising the share prices\nof the merging companies. This paper has examined the impact of UK competition\npolicy on shareholder value based on 50 mergers investigated by the MMC\/CC\nbetween 1989 and 2002. The study builds on earlier work on the effects of\ncompetition policy on shareholder value (especially Wier, 1983, Franks and Harris,\n1993, Forbes, 1994) and examines whether the regulatory process decreases efficient\nmarket behaviour.\nThe empirical results support the findings of earlier work in the US and UK regarding\nthe general level of shareholder value created for the bidder and target companies with\ntarget company shareholders being the main beneficiaries. They also support earlier\nfindings that, on average, high abnormal losses are incurred by target company\nshareholders when a decision is announced by competition authorities prohibiting a\nmerger. However, taking the regulatory process from initial bid to the MMC\/CC\u2019s\nfinal decision, the study does not support the conclusion of Wier (1983) that target\nshareholders faced with a prohibition decision make an overall loss. Instead, a small\ngain to target company shareholder value is recorded.\nUK competition policy has been in existence for over 50 years and while it has gone\nthrough a number of changes, most recently with the Competition Act 1998 and the\nEnterprise Act 2002, investors should have developed an understanding of the\nlikelihood of a referral to the MMC\/CC and the likely decision of the Commission.\nThis understanding will be based on past experience involving similar mergers. It is\nlikely that with the benefit of experience, investors\u2019 judgements of possible\ncompetition policy outcomes will be reasonably stable. This offers one possible\nexplanation for the small percentage losses to target company shareholders reported\n23\nby Wier (1983) compared to the results from this study, which found a small gain to\nshareholders in target companies. Wier\u2019s study deals with a different competition\nregime, that of the US, and perhaps the US stock market had more difficulty in the\nperiod studied in correctly anticipating competition policy decisions.\nThe results also indicated that mergers involving industries in the water, electricity\nand communications industries that were subject to competition inquiries showed less\nefficient market behaviour than those in other industries. The explanation for this\npossibly lies in the greater uncertainty that surrounded the response of regulators to\nmergers in these sectors. The water and electricity sectors had been given a particular\norganisational structure at privatisation and it was unclear whether the regulators\nwould allow this structure to be altered through mergers. The government was known\nto take a special interest in the future of communications because of the perceived\nimportance of this industry for national wellbeing. The \u2018privatisation\u2019 cases may have\nexperienced share price changes that were influenced by inexperience on the part of\ninvestors of the dual regulatory regime that exists for these sectors in the UK,\ninvolving both the MMC\/CC and sector-specific regulatory offices. Another possible\nexplanation relates to the large number of smaller shareholders in privatised firms as a\nresult of government policy at privatisation. Our research was unable to separate out\nthese different possible explanations because of the method used.\nIn summary, the study identifies that where a competition policy regime is stable and\nunderstood, there is no evidence of adverse overall costs due to share price\nmovements for shareholders of target companies, when a merger bid is taken in its\nentirety from announcement to completion. Cases were also tested for evidence of\nefficient market behaviour using Propositions 1 and 2. Both Propositions are based on\nthe assumption of efficient market behaviour and provide a yardstick against which\ncases are tested directly. Proposition 1 applies to merger cases where the deal is\nprohibited by the regulator or abandoned by the companies, and the overall value\nchange arising from bid events to the target company, is expected to be zero.\nProposition 2 applies to merger cases where the deal is allowed (but not conditionally\nallowed), the overall value change arising from bid events to the target company\nbeing greater than zero. While the \u201cother\u201d industry group cases matched both\npropositions, the \u201cprivatised\u201d industry group failed to match in about half on the\n24\ncases. This provides evidence that the market behaviour differed between the two\ngroups. The \u201cother\u201d industry group, operating in the more stable and mature\nregulatory regime, showed evidence of efficient market behaviour having taken place.\nHowever the \u201cprivatised\u201d industry group with the dual regulatory structure, of which\ninvestors had less experience, showed evidence of less efficient market behaviour.\nThe evidence is consistent with a stable regulatory regime supporting efficient market\nbehaviour. The less efficient market behaviour in the \u201cprivatised\u201d group could have\nresulted from two possible causes. Firstly, investor uncertainty in predicting decisions\nof the newer regulatory structure and secondly, the high level of non-institutional\nshareholding in privatised companies may have reduced market efficiency. This\nfinding suggests that where major changes to merger policy are introduced, it is to be\nexpected that a period of adjustment will follow for investors, during which\nexperience is being gained, before more efficient market behaviour returns, and\ninvestors, managers and policy makers should be cognisant of this when making\nplans.\n25\nTable 1: The Merger Cases Included in the Study\nMerger\nOutcome Regulatory Decision\nBidder Target\nMonth and year\nof referral to\nCC \/ MMC\nFinalised (F),\nFinalised before\nreferral (FBR) or\nWithdrawn (W)\nWaived through\n(T), Allowed (A),\nConditionally\nAllowed (C), Laid\nAside (L) or\nProhibited (P)\nConditional\nRemedy -\nStructural\n(S) or\nBehavioural\n(B) C\no\nm\np\net\nit\niv\ne\nb\nid\nd\nin\ng\no\ncc\nu\nrr\ned\nS\nec\nto\nr\nre\ng\nu\nla\nte\nd\nIn\nd\nu\nst\nry\nGEC Plessey Jan-1989 F C B\nSiemens Plessey Jan-1989 F C B\nCoats Viyella Tootal Jun-1989 F C S\nBlue Circle Myson Aug-1989 F A C\nYale Valor Myson Aug-1989 W A C\nAtlas Copco Desoutter Sep-1989 F A\nKingfisher Dixons Jan-1990 W P\nTate & Lyle Berisford Jun-1990 W L\nGlynwed Int Alumasc Grp Jun-1990 W L\nVishay Crystalate Jul-1990 W L C\nTT Crystalate Not referred F T C\nTate & Lyle British Sugar Sep-1990 W P C\nAssctd British Foods British Sugar Not referred F T C\nUnichem Macarthy Sep-1991 W A C\nLloyds Chem Macarthy Oct-1991 F A C\nHillsdown Assctd British Foods Feb-1992 FBR A\nTarmac Steetley Feb-1992 W L C\nRedland Steetley Not referred F T C\nAllied Lyons Carlsberg Mar-1992 F C B\nLloyds Midland May-1992 W L C\nHSBC Midland Not referred F T C\nService Corp Int Plansbrook Group Dec-1994 FBR C S\nGEC VSEL Dec-1994 F A C\nBritish Aerospace VSEL Dec-1994 W A C\nLyonaise Northumbria Water Mar-1995 F C B P\nPowerGen Midlands Electricity Nov-1995 W P P\nNational Power Southern Electricity Nov-1995 W P P\nGEHE Lloyds Chemists Mar-1996 F C S C\nUnichem Lloyds Chemists Mar-1996 W C S C\nGeneral Utilities Mid Kent Holding May-1996 W P P\nSAUR Mid Kent Holdings May-1996 W P P\nWessex Water South West Water May-1996 W P C P\nSevern Trent South West Water May-1996 W P C P\nRobert Wiseman Scottish Pride Aug-1996 F C B C\nP&O Stena Nov-1996 F C B\nPacificorp Energy Group Jul-1997 W A C P\nTexas Utilities Energy Group Not referred F T C P\nTomkins Kerry Apr-1998 FBR C S\nBSkyB Manchester United Oct-1998 W P P\nWhitbread Allied Domecq Jul-1999 W L C\nVivendi BSkyB Nov-1999 FBR C S P\nNTL C&W Communications Nov-1999 F A P\nCarlton United News & Media Feb-2000 W C S C\nGranada United News & Media Feb-2000 F C S C\nLloyds-TSB Abbey National Feb-2001 W P\nReed Elsevier Harcourt General Feb-2001 F C S\nInterbrew Bass Sep-2001 FBR C S\nHilton Grp BSkyB Oct-2001 W L\nGroup4Falk Wackenhut Corporation May-2002 FBR A\nCarlton Granada Mar-2003 F C S\n26\nTable 2: Possible Outcomes following Referral of a Bid to the MMC\/CC\nDecision of the MMC\/CC and the type of remedy prescribed Designation\nof the\noutcome\nThe bid is found to have no adverse affects Allowed\nThe bid is found to have adverse affects and a remedy is prescribed.
