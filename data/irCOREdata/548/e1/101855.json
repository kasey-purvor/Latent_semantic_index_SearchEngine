It is\ntypified by the bully and victim\u2019s inequality of access to\npower in favour of the bully. It may be physical (for\nexample, hitting, kicking or punching) or verbal (saying\nnasty things to a person) and be intentionally hostile\n(Olweus, 1991; O\u2019Connell, Pepler, & Craig, 1999). It\nincludes being \u2018sent nasty notes \u2019 (Smith & Sharp, 1994,\np. 13). It may also be indirect by, for example, involving\nsubtle social manipulation such as gossip, spreading of\nrumours, and exclusion (Lagerspetz, Bjo$ rkvist, & Pel-\ntonen, 1988) and it may cause physical and psychological\ndistress (Smith & Sharp, 1994).\nStudies of children\u2019s definitions of bullying (e.g., Arora &\nThompson, 1987; Boulton, 1997; Smith & Levan, 1995)\nshow that they think similarly about what constitutes\nbullying. Boulton (1997), for example, found that there is\nbroad consensus between children\u2019s definitions and those\ndiscussed above. The major differences are that children\ntend to focus on the more obvious and less subtle forms of\nbullying, such as direct verbal and physical abuse, and to\noverlook social exclusion.\nHowever, there is confirmation from a number of studies\n(e.g., Ahmad & Smith, 1990; Boulton & Underwood,\n1992; Whitney & Smith, 1993) that bullying is extensive in\nUK schools. In the largest questionnaire survey ever\nundertaken in the UK, involving 6758 Sheffield school\npupils in the age range 8\u201318 years, Whitney and Smith\n(1993) found that almost 27% of 7\u201311 year-olds were\nbullied at least \u2018 sometimes\u2019 and that 10% of these were\nbullied at least \u2018once a week\u2019. For secondary age children\n(11\u201318 years old), the respective figures were 10% and\n4%. Overall, this study found that reports of bullying\nshowed a decrease from 8 through to 16 years with a slight\nincrease at the beginning of secondary education (gen-\nerally occurring at 11\u201312 years). The findings of this study\nhave been broadly confirmed by other recent UK surveys\n(Miller, 1995; Pitts & Smith, 1995).\nAlthough bullying has been widely investigated (Crick,\nCasas, & Mosher, 1997; Boulton & Smith, 1994; Olweus,\n1993; Smith & Sharp, 1994; Whitney & Smith, 1993), it\nappears that adults are only aware of a small amount of\nthe bullying behaviour which takes place in schools\n(Olweus, 1991; Rivers & Smith, 1994; Whitney & Smith,\n1993). Scott (1996), for example, suggests that official\nrecords underestimate the extent of the problem except in\nthe most severe cases. A major problem is that many\nchildren are reluctant to intervene or to inform adults\nPaul Naylor, Helen\nCowie & Rosario del\nRey\nSchool of Psychology\nand Counselling,\nUniversity of Surrey\nRoehampton,\nWest Hill,\nLondon SW15 3SN\nChild Psychology & Psychiatry Review Volume 6, No. 3, 2001114\nOriginal Article : Coping Strategies of Bullied Children\n(Cunningham et al., 1998; Olweus, 1993; Whitney &\nSmith, 1993). Another is the reluctance of victims to tell.\nWhitney and Smith (1993) found that around 50% of\nbullied pupils said that they had told neither a teacher nor\na parent that they were being bullied. (Note that in this\nstudy the pupils were not asked whether they had confided\nin a peer.) More recently, Smith and Shu\u2019s (2000) nation-\nwide UK questionnaire survey of 10\u201314 year-old pupils \u2019\nexperiences of being bullied in 19 schools found that 30%\nof bullied children (Nfl 282) said that they had reported\nthe bullying to no one, a proportion larger for boys and\nfor older victims.\nWhy some children remain silent about their experiences\nof being bullied\nWhile there is very little direct evidence as to why some\nchildren fail to make use of adult or peer support to help\nthem deal with the experience of being bullied, researchers\nhave put forward a number of explanations. Children may\nnot always know that they are being bullied, for example,\nwhen they are socially excluded (O\u2019Connell et al., 1999).\nEven when they are aware of being bullied, they may fear\nfurther retaliation from their tormentors (Cowie &\nOlafsson, 1999; Smith & Sharp, 1994) ; they may an-\nticipate ridicule from peers (Rigby & Slee, 1991) ; or they\nmay have no faith in the support systems in their school or\nat home (Cowie & Olafsson, 1999).\nCraig and Pepler (1995) identified a discrepancy between\nchildren\u2019s stated interest in helping victims and their\nactual behaviour. In their study, global ratings of peer\nbehaviours indicated that peers were coded as showing\nmore respect to bullies than to victims. Salmivalli (1999)\nhas also studied children\u2019s behaviour in bullying episodes.\nIn light of her studies, she argues that bullying in school is\noften a group phenomenon in which children take on\ndifferent roles such as assistants to the bully, reinforcers of\nthe bully, or bystanders who are typically in the majority\nand who tend not to intervene. O\u2019Connell et al. (1999)\nsuggest that the relative lack of intervention on the part of\nbystanders may reinforce the bully\u2019s behaviour, and it\nmay signal to victims an accurate lack of sympathy for\ntheir plight.\nHowever, bullied children who tell someone (whether a\nparent, teacher, friend or peer supporter) about their\nproblem said that it helped \u2018to have someone to talk to\nand who listens\u2019, that the process of talking \u2018gave them\nthe strength to overcome the problem\u2019 and that they\nappreciated having \u2018someone who cared\u2019 (Naylor &\nCowie, 1999). Cowie (2000) conducted a preliminary\nanalysis of the responses of 103 pupils in Years 7 and 9\nwho had been bullied at some time in their school careers\nand who had told no one. She found that 36% were girls\n(Nfl 37) and 64% were boys (Nfl 37). There are also\nreports of gender differences in the coping strategies\nadopted by victims (Bijttebier & Vertommen, 1998) with\nboys tending to fight back more often than girls do\n(Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1997).\nThe aim of the present study was to develop and extend\nCowie\u2019s (2000) analysis by comparing the reported coping\nstrategies of children who had been bullied during the\ncurrent school year and, in particular, to investigate the\ndifferences between those who told someone and those\nwho did not. The effects of gender and age on telling or not\nhave also been explored.\nMethod\nThe data in the present study were collected through a\nquestionnaire survey (Naylor & Cowie, 1999) of 51 UK\nsecondary schools (48 comprehensive, 1 independent and\n2 grammar) on the effectiveness of anti-bullying peer\nsupport systems. Typically, these systems are designed to\nimprove the effectiveness of interpersonal relationships\nbetween pupils. They involve the selection and training of\npupils to offer support and help to their peers who are\nbeing bullied. Schools that have such systems usually also\nhave well-articulated anti-bullying and equal opportu-\nnities policies.\nThe schools were contacted through responses to adver-\ntisements placed in teachers \u2019 professional publications.\nInformed consent was sought from the responding schools\nand only those in which their peer support systems had\nbeen established for at least one year were selected for\nparticipation in the study. The questionnaires were admin-\nistered by teachers, at their convenience, in lesson-time\nbetween December 1997 and February 1998. These\nteachers were asked to ensure that pupils completed the\nquestionnaires independently of one another.\nThe questionnaire, written specifically for the purpose,\nsought pupils \u2019 responses to a wide-range of questions on\ntheir personal knowledge and experience of bullying and\nof their schools \u2019 peer support systems. It was completed\nby 1835 actual and potential users of the systems (467 boys\nand 466 girls in Year 7, aged 11\u201312 years, and 423 boys\nand 479 girls in Year 9, aged 13\u201314 years). Year 7 pupils\nwere selected since this is the year when most pupils in the\nUK make the transition from primary to secondary\nschool, and are more at risk of being bullied by stronger\nsame-age peers or older pupils (Whitney & Smith, 1993).\nYear 9 pupils were also selected to take part in the study\nsince they could reflect on two years \u2019 experience at\nsecondary school, and could be expected to have a greater\nawareness and a more sophisticated knowledge and\nunderstanding of bullying and their schools \u2019 peer support\nsystems than Year 7 pupils.\nIn the present study, the effects of gender and age on\nadolescent\u2019s willingness to tell someone about being\nbullied were considered through analysis of some of the\npreviously unexplored data gathered byNaylor and Cowie\n(1999). The responses of bullied Year 7 and Year 9 boys\nand girls who told someone (Nfl 279) were separately\ncompared with those who did not (Nfl 45) for the\nfollowing questions :\nChild Psychology & Psychiatry Review Volume 6, No. 3, 2001 115\nOriginal Article : Coping Strategies of Bullied Children\n\u2014 Please say what you think bullying is?\n\u2014 To which of the following people, if any, have you\nreported being bullied: parent ; teacher ; friend; peer\nsupporter?\n\u2014 How have you coped with being bullied?\nNo limitation was placed on respondents regarding the\nnumber and types of bullying behaviour identified, the\npeople to whom they had reported being bullied listed\nabove or on the coping strategies that they had used.\nRegarding bullying behaviour and coping strategies, the\nresponses were subsequently content analysed to derive\ncategories. The coping strategies of 132 respondents (41%\nof the total) were coded independently by two of the\nauthors (HC and PN)whilst another pairing of the authors\n(PN and RdR) independently coded 80 (25% of the total)\nrespondents \u2019 definitions of bullying.

Also, in comparison with Year\n7, fewer Year 9 pupils, particularly boys, report having\nbeen bullied.\nThe reported coping strategies of the respondents were\ncategorised as shown in Table 3. Other than telling\nsomeone about being bullied, the most commonly used\ncoping strategy is \u2018 ignoring or enduring it \u2019. As Table 3\nshows, the percentages of reported use of the other\nstrategies are small.\nEighty-seven percent (Nfl 186) of those in Year 7 and\n84% (Nfl 93) of those in Year 9 said that they had\nreported the bullying to at least one other person.

Responses \u2018To whom did you report the bullying?\u2019:\n                A comparison of data from Smith and Shu (S & S) (2000) (N = 276) with those from the\n                present study (NCdR) (N = 324)\npupils turned for help to a parent, teacher, friend or peer\nsupporter. As Figure 1 shows, there are gender and age\ndifferences in the data for the present study in these pupils\u2019\nreporting behaviour. These differences have been investi-\ngated by the Chi-square test (v #). For Year 7, boys are as\nlikely as girls are to say that they have told someone (a\nteacher, parent, friend, or peer supporter) about being\nbullied (v #fl 3\u201334, p! \u2013068).\nHowever, by Year 9, boys are much less likely than girls\nare to have told any of these people (v #fl 14\u201362,\np! \u20130005). Considering only those pupils who told at\nleast one person about being bullied, there are no\nsignificant differences for Year 7 boys compared with\nYear 7 girls. Considering age, Year 9 boys are more likely\nthan Year 7 boys are (v #fl 5\u201345, p! \u2013019) to report that\nthey have told no one. There is no significant difference for\ngirls in this respect. For those pupils who did tell someone,\nthere are no significant differences when girls in Year 7 are\ncompared with those in Year 9 in whom they have told\nabout being bullied. Similarly, there are no significant\ndifferences for boys. Forty-five bullied pupils (14%) said\nChild Psychology & Psychiatry Review Volume 6, No. 3, 2001 117\nOriginal Article : Coping Strategies of Bullied Children\nthat they had told no one, over two-thirds of whom were\nboys (18 boys, 9 girls in Year 7; 13 boys, 5 girls in Year 9).\nComparison of the data from the present study with those\nfrom Smith and Shu (2000) (Figure 1) reveals some\ninteresting patterns. Boy and girl victims in the present\nstudy were more likely to tell a member of their family, a\nteacher, a friend or somebody else}a peer supporter than\nthey were in Smith and Shu\u2019s study. They were also\nsignificantly less likely to report that they had told no one\n(14% compared with 30%).\nThe reported coping strategies of the pupils who stated\nthat they had been bullied but who had told no one (31\nboys and 14 girls) about it, were compared with those (113\nboys and 166 girls) who had told someone. With telling\nsomeone discounted as a reaction, the mean number of the\nremaining coping strategies of those who reported the\nbullying is \u2013294 (SDfl\u2013494) whilst that for those who did\nnot tell is \u2013933 (SDfl\u2013539), a difference which is signifi-\ncant (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Zfl 3\u2013539,\np! \u20130005). In other words, only 30% of those victims\nwho told someone used, on average, one other strategy\n(\u2018 ignore}endure it \u2019 ; \u2018physical}verbal retaliation\u2019 ; \u2018ma-\nnipulate social situation\u2019 ; \u2018plan revenge\u2019). Whereas, for\nthose who told no one, on average, each of them used one\nof these strategies.\nThe coping strategies of all of the pupils in the present\nstudy were also compared by year group and gender for\nthose who told someone and those who told no one. These\ndata have been investigated by the Chi-square test (v #).\n(Again, in order to reduce the possibility of committing\nType 1 errors, only outcomes where p! \u2013001 have been\naccepted.)\nIgnore or endure it : The most commonly used strategy by\nthose who told someone and by those who told no one,\nwas \u2018 ignoring or enduring it \u2019. Also, Year 9 boys are more\nlikely than those in Year 7 are to report using this strategy,\nalthough the difference is not significant. However,\nsignificant differences have been found in the more\ncommon use of this reaction by those who have told no\none compared with those who have, for these groups:\nYear 7 girls (v #fl 13\u201397, p! \u20130005) ; Year 7 boys (v #fl\n21\u201307, p! \u20130005) ; Year 9 boys (v #fl 16\u201355, p! \u20130005).\nPhysical and verbal retaliation: Although this reaction is\nmore frequently reported by Year 7 boys and Year 9 girls\ncompared with their counterpart age}gender groups, these\nfindings are not significant. In addition, there are no\nsignificant differences in the use of this reaction between\nany of the other comparison groups investigated.\nAdmission of not coping: Although a greater proportion of\nboth groups of girls compared with their respective groups\nof boys admitted that they were not coping with being\nbullied, these findings are not significant. However, Year\n7 boys who have told no one about being bullied compared\nwith those who have, are more likely to have said that they\nare not coping, but this finding is not significant. In\ncontrast, none of the 13 Year 9 boys who have told no one\nabout being bullied admitted that they were not coping.\nManipulating the social context: Proportionately more\nYear 7 boys than girls report having used this reaction.\nThis is also true of Year 9 girls compared with those in\nYear 7. Of those pupils who told no one about being\nbullied, only a few Year 7 boys reported having used this\nstrategy. However, there are no significant differences in\nthe use of this strategy between any of the subgroups\nanalysed.\nTelling someone (other than the bully): Both year groups\nof girls are more likely than their corresponding boys are\nto tell someone about being bullied. This tendency has\nalso been found for Year 7 compared with Year 9 boys.\nThe only significant finding, however, is that Year 9 girls\nwere more likely than Year 9 boys were to report having\nused this reaction (v #fl 14\u201362, p! \u20130005).\nPlanning revenge: No significant differences in the use of\nthis strategy have been found although proportionately\nmore Year 9 girls report using it compared with those in\nYear 7.\nNo reaction stated: Other than saying that they were \u2018not\ncoping\u2019, five Year 7 respondents (one girl, four boys) and\nnone in Year 9 offer no strategy for combating being\nbullied. These findings are not significant.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, 20% of the respondents chose to\ndefine bullying not only in terms of the bully\u2019s behaviour\nbut also in terms of its effects on the victim. Maybe this\ncommenting on the effects on victims, not reported\nelsewhere, is unsurprising given that all of these respon-\ndents were victims of bullying, which is not true of other\nstudies. Further studies might investigate the differences\nbetween bullied and non-bullied children\u2019s definitions of\nbullying.\nThe most commonly mentioned type of bullying be-\nhaviour in this study was direct verbal (for example, name\ncalling) and physical (for example, hitting and punching)\nabuse. As we might expect of children, few mentioned the\nmore subtle and indirect forms of bullying such as social\nexclusion, a finding that lends support to the suggestion of\nO\u2019Connell et al. (1999) that children may not always know\nthat they are being bullied.\nRegarding the reported coping strategies, the results\nindicate that those victims who did not tell someone that\nthey were being bullied, compared with those who did,\ntended to use more of the other possible coping strategies.\nThe results also suggest some age and gender differences\nbetween those victims who told and those who did not tell\nthat they were being bullied. Older girls were more likely\nto tell someone\u2014either an adult or a peer\u2014than older\nboys were. More than twice as many boys as girl victims\nreported that they had told no one about being bullied, a\nChild Psychology & Psychiatry Review Volume 6, No. 3, 2001118\nOriginal Article : Coping Strategies of Bullied Children\ntendency that becomes more pronounced with age. This\nmay be related to difficulties that boys have in sharing\nfeelings about personal issues, a phenomenon that is well\ndocumented in the literature (Cunningham et al., 1998;\nO> sterman et al., 1997). These difficulties may arise because\nof boys\u2019 socialisation and relationship experiences (for\nexample, Hartup, 1983; Wong & Csikzentmihalyi, 1991),\ntheir perception of what it is to be masculine (Naylor &\nCowie, 1999) and, probably, all of these factors in\ncombination with their biology (Hinde, 1996). Unfortu-\nnately, the respondents in the present study were not\nasked to explain why they had not reported being bullied\nbut this has been done in a two-year follow-up study of\nthese children (to be reported) and so it may soon be\npossible to shed some light on this issue. For whatever\nreason, however, bullied boys are especially vulnerable, as\noften they seem to be prevented from seeking out the\nsupport that they need.\nBy age group, the reported coping strategies of the boys\nand girls in the present study who told no one that they\nwere being bullied were similar. The majority of boys and\ngirls reported that they ignored or endured their plight ;\nonly a small proportion of younger boys reported making\nany attempt to manipulate the social context as a way of\ntrying to avoid being left alone with the bully(ies).\nThese results make an interesting comparison with Smith\nand Shu\u2019s (2000) findings in which it was found that the\nmost common response to the question \u2018What did you do\nwhen someone bullied you?\u2019 was \u2018 ignored them\u2019 (66%)\nfollowed by \u2018told them to stop\u2019 (26%). Only 17% asked\nfriends for help. Girls were more likely to report crying or\nasking friends for help; older children reported more often\nthat they responded by \u2018 ignoring the bullies \u2019. In the\npresent study, fewer bullied pupils reported that they tried\nto ignore the bullying and fewer told no one about the\nbullying. It is also interesting to note that the incidence of\nbullied children who told no one was substantially less\n(14%) in the present study than it was in Smith and Shu\u2019s\n(2000) study (30%).\nThus, it seems that the presence of peer support systems\nencourages victims to report their plight to at least one\nperson. Of course, it is not necessarily true that the\ndifferences between these findings can be solely attributed\nto the existence or not in schools of an anti-bullying peer\nsupport system. Rather, it is likely that there is a significant\ndifference in the ethos of these two types of school. It\nseems that in schools where systems exist compared with\nschools in which they do not, pupils\u2019 and teachers\u2019\nawareness of bullying is more sophisticated and there is a\nclearer message to everyone that it is acceptable to \u2018 tell\nsomebody\u2019 (anybody) about it.\nIn conclusion, the present study highlights the continuing\ndifficulty in targeting bullied children who are reluctant to\nask for help, even where the participants come from\nschools with well-established systems of support and\nactive whole school anti-bullying policies. There is an\nurgent need to identify these children and to find ways of\nenabling them to seek out the help that they need.\nImplications\nFinally, we suggest some implications of the findings of\nthis study for professionals who work with children and\nadolescents. They are:\nE In light of children\u2019s definitions of bullying, a child who\nclaims to have been bullied should be listened to (a\nrecommendation which is consistent with the Children\nAct [HMSO, 1989]) concerning the alleged bully\u2019s\nbehaviour and the effects on him}her. The allegations\nshould be sensitively investigated and the outcomes\nappropriately acted on. In some cases, this may even\ninvolve helping the child to reframe what he}she thinks\nbullying behaviour is.\nE Schools should be encouraged regularly to monitor\nbullying rates and identify vulnerable children by, for\nexample, using the \u2018My Life in School \u2019 questionnaire\n(Arora, 1994).\nE Teachers should monitor children\u2019s friendship patterns\nand investigate why certain children do not have or\nseem not to have at least one friend \u2013 they are highly\nlikely to be suffering from being bullied.\nE In addition to all of the other anti-bullying curriculum\nwork done in schools, including the exploration of the\ndefinition of bullying, teachers might help children\nconsider the possible strategies that bullied children\nmight use and help them assess their likely efficacy.\nE All schools should be encouraged to establish peer\nsupport systems, possibly with the help of educational\nor school psychologists and other professionals.\nE Medical health care professionals (for example, general\npractitioners and school nurses) should routinely check\nwhether a child is being bullied if he}she is manifesting\napparently physical symptoms of illness or is frequently\nabsent from school.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank our pupil respondents for their time,\nPenny Holland, and the anonymous referees for their\ncomments on drafts of this paper.
