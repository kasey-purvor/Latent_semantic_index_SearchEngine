Although usually stated in the literature to be semi-arboreal (e.g. Hodek 1973), it\n35 occupies many habitats, and in parts of both its native and introduced ranges has been\n36 recorded in meadows, heathlands and riparian zones (Adriaens et al. submitted to Bio-\n37 Control SI), reedbeds (Ware et al. 2005; Brown et al. submitted to BioControl SI) and crop\n38 systems (Colunga-Garcia and Gage 1998).\nA22 I.

It has been\n41 widely used for pest control in crops as diverse as pecans (Tedders and Schaefer 1994) and\n42 red pines (McClure 1987). As a biological control agent H. axyridis has incidentally\n43 succeeded in controlling pest aphid species on other crops, including apples (Brown and\n44 Miller 1998) and citrus fruits (Michaud 2002). Despite releases in fourteen US states\n45 between 1964 and 1982 (Gordon 1985), H. axyridis was not reported as established in the\n46 country until 1988 (Chapin and Brou 1991). There is uncertainty over the source of the\n47 established US population, which may originate from a single intentional release or\n48 accidental introduction (Krafsur et al. 1997). Day et al. (1994) suggested that the source\n49 could have been accidental seaport introductions.\n50 Harmonia axyridis has recently been recorded in South America (de Almeida and da\n51 Silva 2002) and South Africa (N. Mgocheki, personal communication; J. Hatting, personal\n52 communication), and has been introduced in Egypt (Ferran et al. 2000) where it has\n53 become established around Cairo (S. Elnagdy, personal communication).\n54 In Europe early introductions ofH. axyridis occurred in the east, including toUkraine from\n55 1964 (for control of aphids on fruit trees) (Katsoyannos et al. 1997) and Belarus from 1968\n56 (Sidlyarevich andVoronin 1973). Inwestern Europe,H. axyridiswas first used as a biological\n57 control agent in 1982 in France and first marketed in 1995 (Coutanceau 2006). Various\n58 companies subsequently made the species commercially available (Adriaens et al. 2003).\n59 In a risk assessment of 31 exotic natural enemies of pest species used in biological\n60 control in Europe, H. axyridis had the second highest environmental risk index. This was\n61 based on its wide host range (i.e. multiple prey species), ability to establish and disperse,\n62 and direct and indirect effects on non-target species (van Lenteren et al. 2003). Van\n63 Lenteren et al. (submitted to BioControl SI) concluded that there are no easy ways to\n64 mitigate or reduce the risk of H. axyridis and that it should not have been released in\n65 northwest Europe.\n66 The aim of this paper is to present a thorough examination of the history, spread and\n67 distribution of H. axyridis in Europe. The data are an amalgamation of records of the\n68 occurrence of H. axyridis in Europe, mapped at 50 km resolution. Records were verified by\n69 the authors, derived from published papers, and\/or made by experienced naturalists.\n70 Countries in which H. axyridis was introduced as a biological control agent\n71 Belgium\n72 Harmonia axyridis was used as a biological control agent in Belgium from 1997 (Adriaens\n73 et al. 2003). A large-scale ladybird field survey (Coccinula\u2013\u2013Belgian ladybird working\n74 group, http:\/\/www.inbo.be\/content\/page.asp?pid=EN_FAU_INS_LAD_start) was laun-\n75 ched in 1999 in the Walloon region, and 2001 in the Flemish region (Adriaens et al. 2003).\n76 By 2007 Coccinula had in excess of 500 volunteer surveyors (Adriaens et al. submitted to\n77 BioControl SI), hence coccinellids are very well recorded in Belgium. Harmonia axyridis\n78 was first found in the wild in Belgium in autumn 2001, in both Ghent and Brussels\n79 (Adriaens et al. submitted to BioControl SI) and the invasion probably originated from\n80 populations in the north of the country. By 2003, H. axyridis was found in large over-\n81 wintering aggregations comprising 500+ individuals (Adriaens et al. submitted to\n82 BioControl SI) and was invading semi-natural ecosystems (Adriaens et al. 2003). Har-\n83 monia axyridis was recorded most commonly in gardens and parks, road verges, forests\nHarmonia axyridis in Europe\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 26-10-2007 Pages : 17\nArticle No. : 9132 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO 634 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n84 and woodland fringes, but it also occurred in other habitats such as heathlands, meadows\n85 and wetlands (Adriaens et al. submitted to BioControl SI). By 2006, H. axyridis was\n86 recorded in all regions of Belgium (Fig. 1). The Coccinula database (data from 1999 to\n87 2007) shows that H. axyridis was the most abundant coccinellid in Flanders, in terms of the\n88 total number of individuals recorded (excluding overwintering groups, which would have\n89 made H. axyridis abundance even higher). Harmonia axyridis was recorded in 76% (426 of\n90 560) of sampled 5 km 2 in Flanders, making it the second highest occurring coccinellid\n91 after Coccinella septempunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In Belgium as a whole,\n92 H. axyridis was recorded in 49% (557 of 1139) of sampled 5 km 2, making its occurrence\n93 fifth highest after C. septempunctata, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.) (Coleoptera:\n94 Coccinellidae), Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Thea vigintiduo-\n95 punctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). A full account of the spread of H. axyridis in\n96 Belgium is provided by Adriaens et al. (submitted to BioControl SI).\n97 Czech Republic\n98 The flightless strain of H. axyridis was introduced into hop gardens in northwestern Czech\n99 Republic in 2003, but the species did not apparently establish at that time.

Nedved and I. Kova\u00b4r\u02c7, unpublished data). In 2007, intentional monitoring\n103 was started (advertised at http:\/\/zoo.bf.jcu.cz\/kz\/harmonia.htm), resulting in records from\n104 all parts of Bohemia and northern Moravia, the eastern-most recorded locality of\n105 H. axyridis in Europe (Fig. 1). Records of ovipositing females and mature larvae confirmed\n106 that the species had established. Most H. axyridis were found on aphid infested woody\n107 plants: cherry Prunus avium L. (Rosaceae), mock-orange Philadelphus coronarius\n108 L. (Hydrangeaceae), steeple-bush Spiraea douglasii Hook (Rosaceae), willow Salix alba\n109 L. (Salicaceae), crab apple Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill. (Rosaceae) and pear Pyrus com-\n110 munis L. (Rosaceae). Based on the findings of mature larvae and ovipositing females, five\n111 prey species; Aphis philadelphi Bo\u00a8rner (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Aphis spiraecola Patch\n112 (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae),\n113 Tuberolachnus salignus (Gmelin) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Cacopsylla pyri (L.)\n114 (Hempitera: Psyllidae); may be considered as suitable (essential sensu Hodek 1973) prey\n115 for H. axyridis.\n116 France\n117 Harmonia axyridis was first introduced to France from China by the Institut National de la\n118 Recherche Agronomique (INRA) (http:\/\/www.inra.fr) in 1982 (Iperti and Bertand 2001),\n119 but was in quarantine until 1990 (Kabiri 2006). Between 1990 and 1997 field experiments\n120 and releases were carried out, especially in southeastern France, but also in the north of the\n121 country and near Paris (Coutanceau 2006). Mass production of H. axyridis in France began\n122 in 1992 and the first open-air commercial field releases were in 1995 (Kabiri 2006). The\n123 species is regarded by Coutanceau (2006) to have become acclimatized in France by 1991.\n124 The earliest known record in the wild is of two individuals, both of the colour form\n125 f. spectabilis (Fig. 2), found at Saint-Aubin (Lot-et-Garonne) in southwestern France in\n126 November 1991 (Coutanceau 2006). Harmonia axyridis was recorded at five overwintering\n127 sites in southern France between 1992 and 1993 (Coutanceau 2006) and at Pas-de-Calais in\n128 northern France, where it was released in hops in 1994 (Trouve\u00b4 1995). There are very few\n129 known records of H. axyridis in France from 1995 to 2003, but from 2004 it was widely\n130 established (Coutanceau 2006) and by 2007 was found across much of northern France\n131 (Fig. 1). It is unknown whether the sparseness of records prior to 2004 is a result of lack of\n132 recording effort, or genuine scarcity of H. axyridis in France at that time. Certainly, since\n133 2004 the recording effort in France has increased, principally due to the launch of a\n134 dedicated survey (Observatoire H. axyridis\u2013http:\/\/perso.orange.fr\/vinc.ternois\/cote_\n135 nature\/Harmonia_axyridis).

Bathon, unpublished data). It was\n140 first recorded in the wild in 1999 in Hamburg (Tolasch 2002) and Frankfurt-Niederrad\n141 (H. Bathon, unpublished data). By 2000, H. axyridis was common in the Rhein-Main region\n142 and there was major expansion of the species in Germany by 2002 (Klausnitzer 2002).\nHarmonia axyridis in Europe\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 26-10-2007 Pages : 17\nArticle No. : 9132 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO 634 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n143 By 2006, H. axyridis occurred in all regions of western Germany and was common in many\n144 cities (F. Ko\u00a8hler, personal communication). The species is well recorded in central eastern\n145 Germany from 2006, but there are few records from the northeast or southeast of the country\n146 (Fig. 1). This may be due to lower recording effort rather than genuine absence of the\n147 species.\n148 Greece\n149 French stock of H. axyridis was introduced into four citrus-growing areas of Greece in\n150 1994 (Katsoyannos et al. 1997). From 1995 to 1999 over 100,000 adult H. axyridis were\n151 released in central and southern Greece and on several islands, to control aphids on various\n152 crops (including citrus, vegetables, beans and maize) (Kontodimas et al. in press). Further\n153 releases took place from 1997 to 2002, mainly in urban areas (Attica and Peloponessos\n154 regions, Corfu, Rhodes and Crete) (Kontodimas et al. in press). Despite these major\n155 releases and four overlapping generations of H. axyridis being reported in Greece\n156 (Katsoyannos et al. 1997), there is little evidence of establishment of the species, although\n157 small numbers (\\50) of overwintered adults were found in Attica in spring 1998 and 1999\n158 (Kontodimas et al. in press) (Fig. 1).\nFig. 2 H. axyridis f. succinea, f. spectabilis and f. conspicua.

The first known sighting of H. axyridis naturalised in Italy, was in Turin in\n162 October 2006, when approximately 30 specimens, including pupae, were found on trees of\n163 an Acer sp. (Aceraceae) (I. Zakharov, unpublished data) (Fig. 1). It is unknown whether\n164 these ladybirds originated from escaped specimens within Italy, or are immigrants from\n165 southern France or Switzerland. In July 2007, a few adult H. axyridis were found at two\n166 sites in the Piedmont region (M. Kenis, unpublished data), presenting further evidence of\n167 establishment in northeastern Italy.\n168 Netherlands\n169 Harmonia axyridis was marketed as a biological control insect in the Netherlands from\n170 approximately 1996 (Cuppen et al. 2004) until 2003. The first record of H. axyridis\n171 naturalised in the Netherlands was in October 2002, when a pupa was found on an ivy\n172 Hedera helix L. (Araliaceae) leaf in Nijmegen. A larva of H. axyridis was confirmed in\n173 Rotterdam the following month. Initial distribution was reported primarily in the southern\n174 half of the country. Numbers of H. axyridis rose dramatically from 2004 (Loomans 2004)\n175 and survey effort was increased from that year, with records requested via three Dutch\n176 websites (http:\/\/www.stippen.nl, http:\/\/www.knnv.nl and http:\/\/www.nev.nl). The species\n177 appears to have spread from south to north, and by 2006 all mainland 50 km 2 in the\n178 Netherlands had records of H. axyridis (Fig. 1). Over 2000 records of the species were\n179 received between 2002 and 2007.\n180 Portugal\n181 Between 1984 and 1985, H. axyridis was used to control aphids on citrus crops in the\n182 Algarve province of Portugal, and on the Portuguese administered islands of the Azores\n183 (Katsoyannos et al. 1997; Soares et al. submitted to BioControl SI). There is no evidence\n184 of subsequent establishment. However, recent work by Soares and Serpa (2007) concluded\n185 that if re-introduced to the Azores, H. axyridis would present a risk to the native species\n186 Coccinella undecimpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).\n187 Spain\n188 In 1995 H. axyridis was introduced to control aphids on greenhouses in Almeria,\n189 southeastern Spain (SIFA 2004). It established in greenhouses (Jacas et al. 2006), but\n190 there is no evidence of subsequent establishment in the wild. In 2003 and 2004 two\n191 specimens of H. axyridis were found in a garden on Tenerife, Canary Islands and it was\n192 found again on the island in 2006 (S. Eizaguirre, personal communication). There are no\n193 official reports of introductions of H. axyridis for agricultural purposes from the Canary\n194 government, and the species is not believed to be present in large numbers (Machado\n195 2005). In 2007, two adult H. axyridis were collected from flowers of a Tilia platyphyllos\n196 Scop. (Tiliaceae) tree in a park in Loiu, Bilbao, Basque country of northern Spain\n197 (A. Goldarazena, unpublished data) (Fig. 1). This is the first record of naturalised\nHarmonia axyridis in Europe\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 26-10-2007 Pages : 17\nArticle No. : 9132 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO 634 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n198 H. axyridis in the Iberian peninsula. There is no evidence that H. axyridis was released\n199 for biological control purposes in the Basque country (R. Amenabar, personal commu-\n200 nication). The specimens are likely to have either originated from France, or from\n201 imported goods entering the nearby Bilbao airport.\n202 Switzerland\n203 Harmonia axyridis was available commercially in Switzerland for a short period in the late\n204 1990s, and was used in a small field trial on roses in Grossdietwil in 1996 (Andermatt\n205 1996). However, H. axyridis did not apparently establish as a result, and applications for\n206 the commercial release of the species were refused by the Swiss Pesticide Regulatory\n207 Authority in 1997 (van Lenteren et al. submitted to BioControl SI). No adults were found\n208 in the wild in Switzerland until 2004, when a single specimen was found at an exhibition of\n209 Asian plants in Basle (Klausnitzer 2004). Harmonia axyridis was not found during surveys\n210 in 2005, but in 2006 it was recorded in ten cantons in northern Switzerland (Eschen et al.\n211 2007), and larvae of the species were found for the first time in Switzerland. The higher\n212 abundance of the beetle near the northern border suggests that it invaded the country from\n213 southern Germany and\/or eastern France. In a large survey for ladybirds in northwestern\n214 Switzerland, H. axyridis was found to be the seventh most abundant species on trees and\n215 shrubs, and the first cases of aggregations on buildings were notified in autumn 2006 in\n216 Basle, where the species was the most abundant coccinellid at some sites (Eschen et al.\n217 2007). The monitoring continued in 2007 and a dedicated website was launched\n218 (http:\/\/www.cabi-bioscience.ch\/harmonia). By late 2007, the ladybird was found in most\n219 Swiss cantons (Fig. 1).\n220 Countries in which H. axyridis has been found in the wild without evidence\n221 of deliberate introduction\n222 Austria\n223 In Europe and North America, the attraction of H. axyridis to buildings for use as over-\n224 wintering sites (Koch 2003) has increased the number of sightings of the species. The first\n225 published record in Austria (October 2006; Wiener Neustadt, eastern Austria) was one\n226 such sighting, where several adult specimens of H. axyridis were found on a house wall\n227 searching for an overwintering site (Rabitsch and Schuh 2006). An earlier record subse-\n228 quently came to light, in which H. axyridis larvae were found on plants on a balcony in\n229 nearby Vienna in July 2006, and there are several later records of adults in Vienna in 2006\n230 and 2007 (W. Rabitsch, unpublished data). Harmonia axyridis is clearly established in\n231 Austria, and independent observations in the west (Go\u00a8tzis, October 2006; Rankweil, April\n232 2007; Vorarlberg, August 2007), centre (Salzburg, May 2007), and south (Herberstein, July\n233 2007) of the country (W. Rabitsch, unpublished data), support the hypothesis of spread\n234 from Switzerland and\/or Germany (Fig. 1). There is no known evidence that H. axyridis\n235 was used for biological control purposes in Austria, making it less likely that the spread\n236 resulted from (illegally) imported specimens escaped from greenhouses or gardens. The\n237 scattered documentation of H. axyridis in Austria reflects the largely unnoticed expansion\n238 in the country. No large aggregations have yet been reported, with the maximum number\n239 from a single site (Vienna) being approximately 20 adult H. axyridis.\nP. M. J.

Then and on five subsequent occasions in August 2006,\n243 October 2006 and June 2007, a total of 14 adults of H. axyridis were found in a light trap.\n244 Similarly, a single adult was found in a light trap at Mandemarke, in each of August 2006\n245 and July 2007 (J. Pedersen, unpublished data) (Fig. 1). All specimens were f. succinea\n246 (Fig. 2). Denmark is the most northerly country in Europe where H. axyridis is thought to\n247 have established. It is not known to have been introduced there and is assumed to have\n248 spread north from Germany.\n249 Great Britain and the Channel Islands\n250 The first record of H. axyridis in Great Britain, in September 2004, initiated considerable\n251 media and public interest, and led to the launch of the web-based Harlequin Ladybird\n252 Survey (http:\/\/www.harlequin-survey.org) (Majerus et al. 2006; Roy et al. 2006). Thanks\n253 to thousands of contributors across Britain, the species has been recorded and mapped at\n254 high resolution (Roy et al. 2005; Brown et al. submitted to BioControl SI) and its rapid\n255 spread north and west from the southeast is clear (Fig. 1). By mid 2007, H. axyridis was\n256 recorded in 88% of English and 38% of Welsh vice counties. It was also found on the\n257 island of Jersey, Channel Islands. We predict that it will continue to spread north and reach\n258 Scotland by the end of 2008. Three colour forms have been recorded in Britain; f. succinea,\n259 f. spectabilis and f. conspicua (Fig. 2). A detailed account and analysis of the spread of\n260 H. axyridis in Great Britain is provided by Brown et al. (submitted to BioControl SI).\n261 Liechtenstein\n262 Harmonia axyridis was found for the first time in the tiny principality of Liechtenstein in\n263 August 2007 (A. Loomans, unpublished data). The whole principality is contained within a\n264 single 50 km2 in which there were earlier records for both Austria and Switzerland.\n265 Luxembourg\n266 Considering that the border areas of France, Belgium and Germany that surround Lux-\n267 embourg were all known to have populations of H. axyridis (Fig. 1), it was inevitable that\n268 the species would arrive in this small country. It was present by September 2004, when first\n269 recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus L. (Aceraceae) in the south of Luxembourg (Schneider\n270 and Loomans 2006). Further sightings of H. axyridis were made in October, November and\n271 December 2004 in urban locations (Schneider and Loomans 2006) and large reproducing\n272 populations were recorded in August 2005 in the north (Clervaux) and south (Luxembourg\n273 City) of the country (M. Majerus, unpublished data).\n274 Norway\n275 Whilst there is no evidence that H. axyridis is established in Norway, it has been recorded\n276 in Oslo, having been found on horticultural plants imported from the Netherlands in April\n277 2006 (Staverloekk et al. in press) (Fig. 1).\nHarmonia axyridis in Europe\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 26-10-2007 Pages : 17\nArticle No. : 9132 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO 634 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n278 Sweden\n279 Harmonia axyridis was first recorded in Sweden in Malmo\u00a8 in April 2007 (T.

Subsequently, a dead\n281 adult was found at the same location, and it is thought that the species had been over-\n282 wintering in the house, suggesting that it arrived in late 2006, possibly from Germany or\n283 Denmark. There are no other known records of H. axyridis in Sweden.\n284 Establishment and spread\n285 Harmonia axyridis has spread in Europe at a very fast rate (Table 1; Fig. 3). It is not\n286 possible to fully explain the mechanisms of spread leading to the current distribution,\n287 because of the spatial and temporal aspects of the deliberate releases of H. axyridis. This\n288 involved multiple introduction sites in at least twelve European countries over a period of\n289 approximately forty years (Table 1).\n290 Time lags may occur throughout the invasion process, including the arrival, estab-\n291 lishment and impacts of the invading species (Crooks 2005). Our data indicates a variable\n292 time lag between initial establishment and major expansion, at least in the countries where\n293 H. axyridis was deliberately introduced.

In countries where the species has not\n296 known to have been introduced, there seems to be very little time lag between the first\n297 record of establishment and major expansion (e.g. less than one year in England). The\n298 period between establishment and rapid spread in the USA is difficult to assess because of\n299 multiple intentional releases over many years (Gordon 1985), uncertainty over the date of\n300 establishment, and ambiguity over whether an intentional release or an accidental intro-\n301 duction was the source of establishment (Day et al. 1994; Koch 2003).\n302 The reasons for the time lag between establishment of H. axyridis and major expansion\n303 in Europe are as yet unknown. However, it is possible that it is related to the genetic make-\n304 up of releases, and to differences between environmental conditions in the locations where\n305 released stocks originated and where they were released. The genetic make-up of released\n306 stocks would be a function of selection acting to locally adapt populations in their native\n307 range before collection, and random genetic drift and selection acting on laboratory cul-\n308 tures before release. It is likely that some cultures passed through genetic bottlenecks while\n309 in culture. Moreover, there are reports of rapid changes in some obvious genetically\n310 controlled traits in laboratory cultures. For example, the phenotypic frequencies of melanic\n311 forms (f. conspicua and f. spectabilis) of a laboratory population increased from 0.5 to\n312 [0.99 in 50 generations (Berkvens et al. submitted to BioControl SI). As many laboratory\n313 cultures are maintained on diets that H. axyridis would not encounter in the wild (i.e.\n314 Ephestia eggs), it is inevitable that released beetles will have been exposed to abnormal\n315 selection pressures in captivity. In consequence, it is highly unlikely that released indi-\n316 viduals will be precisely adapted to the conditions that they face in their introduced range.\n317 In many cases, releases therefore do not lead to establishment, as recorded for H. axyridis\n318 in the USA (Gordon 1985) and Greece (Kontodimas et al. in press). However, if we\n319 assume that at least some individuals do survive and reproduce, the expectation would be\n320 that these would take time to start increasing in number significantly, for two reasons. First,\n321 because of their as yet imperfect adaptation to local conditions, and second because at low\n322 population size they are likely to suffer the effects of inbreeding depression, which is\n323 considerable in many aphidophagous coccinellids (Hodek 1973; Majerus 1994, 2003).\n324 There will thus be a period after establishment during which the average fitness of\n325 members of the population increase as the population is purged of deleterious recessives\n326 (Haldane 1927), and slowly becomes better locally adapted to the new conditions, through\n327 selection acting on the genotypic variation generated by recombination and mutation\n328 (Fisher 1930). It is only once the population has become locally adapted that it will start to\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\npre 2001 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nYear\nN\no.\nqs\n \nmk\n 0 5\n \nsera\nu\nFig. 3 Cumulative occurrence\nof H. axyridis in 50 km 2 in\nEurope\nHarmonia axyridis in Europe\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 26-10-2007 Pages : 17\nArticle No. : 9132 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO 634 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n329 increase in number. However, the rate of increase may then be rapid for two reasons. First,\n330 the population may have been purged of deleterious recessive alleles, as mentioned above.\n331 Second, while in culture the released beetles may have been inadvertently selected for\n332 rapid reproduction, high fecundity and broad dietary range; biological control companies\n333 reared large numbers as efficiently as possible for commercial reasons. Once numbers in a\n334 released population increased sufficiently to approach carrying capacity, increased rate of\n335 dispersal would be inevitable as the beetles sought new resources. The rate of this process\n336 may vary greatly depending on factors such as the size of the original samples collected\n337 from the native range, the number of different populations that such samples were col-\n338 lected from, the length of time and number of generations that cultures were kept in\n339 captivity for before release, the number of individuals that founded each culture genera-\n340 tion, and the number of beetles finally released. If releases involved stocks with quite\n341 different origins, then the speed of local adaptation would be faster than if all released\n342 beetles were from a single stock. This is because matings between individuals from dif-\n343 ferent locally adapted populations would produce a greater range of genetic variants among\n344 their offspring for selection to act upon.\n345 The initial need for adaptation before increase in number and spread may explain the\n346 lack of a time lag between establishment and major expansion in countries where\n347 H. axyridis was not deliberately introduced; individuals of H. axyridis arriving in these\n348 countries from parts of the introduced range had already been through the adaptation phase.\n349 So after a period of adaptation of one or several populations in France, Netherlands,\n350 Belgium and\/or Germany, a rapid spread of H. axyridis occurred throughout Europe.\n351 Genetic variation and the origins of H. axyridis in Europe\n352 Three main colour forms of adult H. axyridis have been found in Europe: f. succinea,\n353 f. spectabilis and f. conspicua (Fig. 2). The typical form axyridis, which predominates in\n354 central Asia (Dobzhansky 1933; I. Zakharov and M. Majerus, personal observation), has\n355 not yet been recorded in Europe. The succinea complex has been divided into many\n356 subforms (e.g. siccoma\u2013\u20130 spots; frigida\u2013\u20136 spots; novemdecimsignata\u2013\u201319 spots)\n357 (Dobzhansky 1933), but is regarded as a single form here. Thus f. succinea has elytra with\n358 a ground colour of yellow, orange, or red, and 0\u201321 black spots, which may or may not be\n359 fused. Forma spectabilis has black elytra with four yellow, orange, or red spots or other\n360 shaped markings, which sometimes contain a central black spot. Forma conspicua is as\n361 f. spectabilis, but with only the anterior pair of spots.\n362 There is strong evidence of a link between climate and colour form in coccinellids (e.g.\n363 Majerus 1994, 1998). Whilst the basis of difference in distinct colour form (e.g. f. succinea\n364 cf. f. spectabilis) is genetic, difference in colouration within a form is at least partly\n365 environmental. For example, in many species of coccinellid, inverse correlations between\n366 temperature and extent of melanic patterning have been reported (e.g. Dobzhansky 1933;\n367 Abbas et al. 1988; Majerus 1998). In the case of H. axyridis, the amount of melanism in\n368 f. succinea was found to increase at high elevations (Nalepa et al. 1996).\n369 European populations of H. axyridis generally include a mix of the three colour forms,\n370 but with f. succinea predominating (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in England the percentage of\n371 melanic specimens declined markedly from the year of arrival of H. axyridis, 2004 (45%,\n372 n = 344) (Majerus and Roy 2005) to the second year, 2005 (20%, n = 6180) (M. Majerus,\n373 unpublished data). The broad consistency in the colour form frequency data from Europe\n374 (Fig. 4) provides some evidence of the genetic similarity of populations in different\nP. M.

Further, we suggest that this possible genetic similarity is the result of\n376 spread of the species from very limited points of origin in Europe. Genetic analyses of\n377 H. axyridis samples from different countries are needed in order to confirm this.\n378 Traits that give H. axyridis a competitive advantage over native coccinellids\n379 In Europe, H. axyridis has been shown to be multi-voltine, with evidence of four gener-\n380 ations per year in Greece (Katsoyannos et al. 1997) and two generations per year in Great\n381 Britain (Brown et al. submitted to BioControl SI). Production of multiple generations\n382 would help to explain the rapid spread of H. axyridis in Europe. In northern Europe, many\n383 native coccinellids are uni-voltine (Majerus 1994; Klausnitzer and Klausnitzer 1997), thus\n384 H. axyridis may have a significant advantage over them in terms of potential population\n385 growth. Dispersal of H. axyridis in northern Europe appears to occur primarily in autumn,\n386 when the species moves to aggregate at overwintering sites. This pattern is similar to that\n387 observed in North America (Koch 2003). Large overwintering aggregations have been\n388 observed in several European countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, France,\n389 Germany and England.\n390 Recent European research has provided further evidence of the adaptability and resil-\n391 ience of H. axyridis. In laboratory experiments, 35\u201348% of H. axyridis larvae fed a pollen-\n392 only diet successfully reached adulthood, and although fitness was reduced, approximately\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nBelgium\n(n=5164)\nCzech Rep.\n(n=51)\nEngland\n(n=6180)\nLuxembourg\n(n=28)\nCountry (sample size)\nPe\nr\n r\nu\nol\noc\n f\no\n egat\nnec\nr\nof\nm\nmelanic (unspecified form)\nf. conspicua\nf. spectabilis\nf. succinea\nFig. 4 Percentages of H. axyridis colour forms in various countries (Belgium data from 2004\u20132006\n(Adriaens et al. submitted to Biocontrol SI), Czech Republic data from 2006\u20132007 (O.

Roy et al. (submitted to BioControl SI) found that only the highest dose (109 spores\n395 ml-1) of the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota:\n396 Hypocreales) killed H. axyridis, whereas two other species included in the study\n397 (A. bipunctata and C. septempunctata) experienced high mortality (70% and 80%\n398 respectively) at a medium dose (107 spores ml-1) of the pathogen. Koyama and Majerus\n399 (submitted to BioControl SI) found that H. axyridis had lower susceptibility than\n400 C. septempunctata to the parasitoid wasp Dinocampus coccinellae (Schrank) (Hymenop-\n401 tera: Braconidae). Recent work on intraguild predation (Pell et al. submitted to BioControl\n402 SI; Roy et al. in press; Ware and Majerus submitted to BioControl SI; Ware et al. in press)\n403 indicates that H. axyridis will have a serious negative impact on native coccinellids in\n404 Europe.\n405 Conclusion\n406 We predict that H. axyridis will continue to spread in Europe, particularly northwards and\n407 eastwards. Northwards there are already initial records from Norway and Sweden, and\n408 whilst there is little evidence of establishment to date, this is likely in the near future.\n409 Spread into the Baltic states and Finland is also likely. Given that H. axyridis survives as a\n410 native species in parts of Siberia, the climate in these countries should not be a barrier to\n411 establishment. Eastwards it is entirely possible, (indeed likely), that the species is already\n412 present, but undetected, in countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia.\n413 Ireland is the only remaining country left to be invaded from the westward spread, and we\n414 predict that H. axyridis will reach there, from Great Britain, in the relatively near future,\n415 and once established will spread across the whole country. The spread southwards is less\n416 certain, although as the species is adapted to Mediterranean and sub-tropical climates in\n417 parts of its native range (southern Japan and China), it may gradually adapt to the warmer\n418 climes of southern Europe, the Iberian peninsular and north Africa, and eventually\n419 establish and spread there. Indeed there are already initial reports of establishment in Egypt\n420 (S. Elnagdy, personal communication). Over a very short time period H. axyridis is likely\n421 to become one of the most widely distributed coccinellids in Europe. It remains to be seen\n422 what effect this will have on native coccinellids, but mounting evidence suggests a seri-\n423 ously detrimental impact.\n424 Acknowledgements We extend our thanks to all of the following: the thousands of volunteer recorders\n425 and naturalists across Europe who have provided records; others who have provided records and support,\n426 including; Manfred Bernhard, Gernot Hoch, Erwin Holzer, Andreas Kapp (Austria); Burkhard Hinners-\n427 mann, Frank Ko\u00a8hler, Manfred Uhlig (Germany); Theodoor Heijermans, Kees van der Krieke, Paul van\n428 Wielink, (Netherlands); Arnstein Staverloekk (Norway); David Calvo (Spain); Natural Environment\n429 Research Council, Paul Mabbott, Laura-Jane Michie, Remy Ware, Ian Wright (UK); Gavin Hatt and Ken\n430 Dolbear for permission to use their images.
