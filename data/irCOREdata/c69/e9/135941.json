Minoxidil (0.1-100 microM, p<0.001), NNC 55-0118 (1 mM, p<0.01; 0.1, 10, 100 microM, p<0.001), and diazoxide (10 microM, p<0.01) increased growth. Tolbutamide (1 mM) inhibited growth (p<0.001) and abolished the effect of 10 microM minoxidil, diazoxide and NNC 55-0118; glibenclamide (10 microM) had no effect, but prevented stimulation by 10 microM minoxidil.
