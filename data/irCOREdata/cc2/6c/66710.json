Matters have not been assisted by the prejudicial\nassumptions of Shaw in 1920 who, through his hostility towards academia,\nchose to venerate Elgar at the expense ofthe 'Little clique of musicians, who,\nwith the late Hubert Parry as its centre, stood for British music thirty-five\nyears ago'. It was a statement refuted with some vigour by Elgar himselfwho\nclearly retained an admiration for Parry. 1 Such polarised and entrenched\nviews had taken root some time earlier. Ernest Walker, a descendant of the\n'Oxford School' ofcriticism (which included Parry and Hadow), devoted an\nequal amount of space in his A History ofEnglish Music of 1907 to 'the trio\nofcomposers IParry, Stanford, Elgar1who stand by common consent at the\nhead of modern English music', and quietly denounced Elgar's 'hot-house\ntype of emotionalism', his 'forced pseudo-impressiveness', and a tendency\nto allow colour to hide content.2 This was a view endorsed by Edward\nJ. Dent, Professor of Music at Cambridge and a one-time Stanford pupil,\nwhose cursory treatment of Elgar (in favour of Parry and Stanford) in his\nessay 'Englander' for Guido Adler's Handbuch der Musikgeschichte in 1930\nepitomised an academic scorn for Elgar's music. To defend Elgar's position\nthere were Ernest Newman and C. W. Orr (in particular his article in the\nMusical Times. 'Elgar and the Public', of 1931), the angry rejoinder to Dent's\nchapter in the form of a letter to the national newspapers in Britain and\nGermany signed by the younger generation of composers including Philip\nHeseltine, E. J. Moeran, John Ireland, and William Walton (as well as the\nanti-academic Shaw), and Basil Maine's fulsome Elgar: His Life and Works.\npublished in May 1933. The cumulative weight of these and other writings\nby Tovey, Foss, Vaughan Williams, and Howes,) and W. H. Reed's Elgar\nas 1 Knew Him (1936), established Elgar's public profile and his role as a\nnational icon. Yet there were those who felt that the new wave of Elgar\nliterature still provided a distorted picture, as is evident from the appeal of\n[ 151 another Stanford pupil, Thomas Dunhill: 'Several ofthose who have written\n16 Jeremy Dibble\nin praise of Elgar have to a large extent defeated their own ends by viewing\nhis works through a telescope, and then reversing the telescope to look at\nthose of his contemporaries through the wrong end.\"\nAs one might expect, such polarised positions only served to obscure a\nmore complex image ofElgar's interaction with his native colleagues. More-\nover, Elgar's own experiences of and comments about his contemporaries,\nnotably those ofa more negative nature, require a fuller and more thorough\ncontextualisation. We know, for example, that his early disappointment at\nthe Covent Garden Theatre in 1884, when a rehearsal of his music was\npromised, and his despondent return to Worcester after Sullivan used up\nall the rehearsal time on a selection from one of his operas, was, as Elgar\nhimself admitted, not the result of malice or aloofness on Sullivan's pan.\nIn 1898, at Leeds, when Caraetacus was to be premiered, the two men met\nfor the first time. Sullivan, according to Elgar, was astonished: '\"But, my\ndear boy, I hadn't the slightest idea of it: he exclaimed, in his enthusiastic\nmanner. \"Why on eanh didn't you come and tell me? I'd have rehearsed\nit myself for you.\u00bb They were no idle words. He would have done it, just\nas he said.\" More imponantly Elgar gained some assistance from Frederic\nCowen, who had not only established his reputation as a composer ofopera,\nchoral works, and symphonies but was also a well-respected conductor of\nthe Philharmonic Society. Cowen perused Elgar's early compositions and it\nhas been suggested that he also provided Elgar with introductions to various\nLondon publishers. Such help was acknowledged by Elgar many years later\nat a banquet in Cowen', honour given by the Music Club on 14 May 1925.\nCowen's growing national reputation as a composer and executant dur-\ning the early 1880s (not least with his 'Scandinavian' Symphony which\nattracted attention from all over Europe, including Brussels, Paris, Berlin,\nand Prague) was almost cenainly the principal reason why Elgar had\napproached him.' However, Cowen's music was only pan ofa much larger\ntide of new talent that was emerging in London and the provinces. That\nElgar recognised this change is implicit in his comments for his inaugu-\nral (and somewhat controversial) lecture, 'A Future for English Music', as\nPeyton Professor at Birmingham University on 16 March 1905.\nIn Iookillg!or a practical starting point for anything that may be usefully\nconsidered in rdation to present day music, I think it unnecessary to go\nback fmher than 1880. I do not say definitely that that is the best starting\npoint, but it is sufficient for the purpo~. The history of music from the time\nof Purcell onwards is well known, and it would be mertly a tiresome\nre~ition of the ordinary commtreiallecturt to go over the two centuries\npr\u00abtding 1880. Some ofus who in that year wefe young and taking an active\npart in music - a rtaUy active part such as playing in orchestras - felt that\nsomething at last was going to be done in the way of composition by the\nJ7 Elgar and his British conWnporaries\nEnglish school Alarge nurnb<r ofcompositions during the twenty years\nfollowing, wet< brought b<fot< us. and the whole armosphet< of English\nmusic was changed. owing to the spread of mwical education, which was\nout of proponion to the natural growth of the population; or, to put it\nplainly, that musical taste has increased. An inta-af hitherto unknown was\ntaken in the work of OUT native composers?\nElgar's allusion to 1880 may have b\u00abn simply a convenient 'round num-\nber', but he could have b\u00abn referring to the premiere of Parry's Prometheus\nUnbound, given at Gloucester that same year, and a work which, owing\nto its unbridled Wagnerian influences, had a disturbing effect on some of\nthe press. Whether Elgar was at Gloucester to hear Parry's new work is\nnot known, but, as the words of his first Birmingham lecture stress, Elgar\nwas experiencing and assimilating all that was going on in British music\nfrom the perspective ofa practiaJ1 musician. As an orchestral violinist Elgar\nparticipated in many of the amateur and semi-professional orchestras in\nthe Midlands at a time when such bodies were enjoying an extraordinary\nrevitalisation of interest and enthusiasm. He played first for the Worcester\nThree Choirs Festival in 1878 and last in 1893. In 1881 he ~an playing in\nStockley's orchestra for the series of Birmingham Popular Concerts. There\nwere other less prestigious but no less active societies which included the\nHereford Philharmonic Society (which he led from April (891) and the\nWorcester Festival Choral Society (whose orchestra he also led after J89 I),\nand after he gave up playing, there were institutions such as the Worcester-\nshire Philharmonic which exercised his energies as a conductor. Add to this\nhis friendships with George Robertson Sinclair (who carne to Hereford in\n1889), Hugh Blair (organist of Worcester from 1895 to 1897),lvor Atkins\n(who succeeded Blair in 1897), the two Gloucester organists, Charles Lee\nWilliams and his successor, Herbert Brewer, and Charles Swinnerton Heap\n(organist, composer, and one of the most prominent choral conductors in\nthe Birmingham conurbation), and Elgar was able to enjoy both a famil-\niarity with the entire choral network of the region and (even as a Catholic\n'outsider') the world ofAnglican cathedral music.a\nAt Worcester in 1878 Elgar played in Stainer's cantata, The Daughter of\nJairus, a work of post-Mendelssohnian proportions, though by no means\nwithout bold progressions, as can be seen in the striking overture. Other\npieces by Armes and Ouseley belonged to an earlier generation whose works\nElgar, hungry for the sound of modern European music, already found\nwearisome: he later recalled thaI 'they lacked that feding for orchestral\neffect and elasticity in instrumentation so obvious in the works of French,\nItalian, and German composers'.' The colour of Parry's Prometheus - a\nstreak ofmodernity the composer would jettison in later works- would have\n18 Jeremy Dibble\ncertainly fired Elgar's orchestral imagination in 1880, but the following year,\nwhen Alexander Mackenzie's cantata The Bride came to Worcester, Elgar\nimmediately identified both with the composer's flair for instrumentation\nand the fact that Mackenzie had cut his teeth as an orchestral violinist: '0\nThe coming of Mackenzie then was a real event. Here was a man fully\nequipped in every department of musical knowledge. who had been a\nviolinist in orchestras in Germany. It gave orchestral players a real lift and\nwidened the outlook of the old-fashioned professor considerably. The Bride\nwas a fine example of choral and orchestral writing . ..\nJhad the honour to meet the composer the foHawing morning and\nactually shook hands with him at Sansome Lodge. 11\nDvorak's music, including his Sixth Symphony, held Elgar's attention at\nthe Worcester Festival in 1884, but on 8 October 1885 he would be intro-\nduced for the first time, through his employment as a violinist in Stockley's\nBirmingham orchestra, to one of Stanford's major choral works, The Three\nHoly Children. Performed at the 1885 Birmingham Festival, for which it was\ncommissioned, Stanford's oratorio provided Elgar with a vibrant example\nofchoral and orchestral integration together with an insight into inventive\nchoral forms. Further formative experiences were to follow in Cowen's Ruth\nat Worcester in 1887 and a clutch of Parry's works between 1887 and 1893-\nBlest Pair ofSirens, the oratorios judith and job, the Ode to St Cecilia and\nthe Overture to an Unwrinen Tragedy, in which Elgar played under Parry's\nbaton.\"\nTo a large extent the more negative perspective of Elgar's relationship\nwith his Victorian contemporaries stems from the important yet dispiriting\nyears of 1889 and 1891 when Elgar, newly married, removed with his wife\nto London. Though this period constituted Elgar's 'universiry' experience,\nin that he learned much from concen-going, visiting the opera, and making\nhimself known to London publishers, he was nevertheless personally dis-\nappointed with the lack of progress he was able to make with his career\noutside the Midlands. Added to which, his first major orchestral work,\nFroissart, written in Kensington between April and July 1890 and on which\nthe composer undoubtedly rested his hopes, made no headway initially after\nits Worcester premiere later that year, as Manns, to whom Elgar showed the\nscore, was in no hurry to programme it at the Crystal Palace. Back in Malvern,\nElgar was forced to resume his teaching practice and to return, reluctantly,\nto playing his violin in regional orchestras. 'I played 1st violin for the sake of\nthe fee as I cd. obtain no recognition as a composer' were the words he wrote\nsomewhat despairingly on his festival programme at Worcester in 1893.13\nKennedy has proffered an interpretation ofthese comments, suggesting that\nthe premiere of Parry's job prompted Elgar to compare his poor fortune\n19 Elgar and his British contemporaries\n(if poor fortune it was) with the burgeoning success of his contemporaries.\nThis may be true, but if Elgar felt resentment, he had little reason to feel\nbitterness towards his colleagues, for in the early 18905, as Kennedy has\nalso submitted, he had little to offer the public.'\u00b7 Brief exposure occurred\nwith the publication of Froissartby Novello and by circulation of the part-\nsong 'My Love Dwelt in a Northern Land' in the MusiC\/J1 Times after its\npublication by Novello in 1890; but there was nothing substantial to raise\nElgar's national profile nor was there anything to bring his name before his\nmore nationally renowned peers. It was only in 1896, with the advent of The\nLight ofLife at Worcester and Scenes from the Saga ofKing Olafat the North\nStaffordshire Music Festival, that Elgar's name truly came before the public\nfor the first time. This rise to fame was aided by Iaeger's assertive policy with\nNovello, the avid promotion of King Olafin The MusiC\/J1 Times. and the first\nLondon performances ofextracts from Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands\nand King Olafat the Crystal Palace under Manns the following year. It was\nal exactly this time that Iaeger brought Elgar 10 the attention of Parry:\nLook out for Elgar's 'King Olaf. Though uoequal & in places open '0\ncriticism I think th~rt is som~ fine stuff in this. The young man has\nimagination, ~auty, strength, 'go'.

Whether h~ will do anything great, the future\nwill prove. IS\nAfter hearing Elgar's Caractaeu.l rehearsed at St lames's Hall for the Leeds\nFeslival in 1898, Parry first met Elgar at the premiere on 5 October. Shortly\nafter hearing Caractaeu.l in London, Parry witnessed the premiere under\nRichter of the 'Enigma' Variations at 5t lames's Hall on 19 lune 1899 and\nenthusiastically recorded in his diary 'Elgar's Variations first rate. Quite bril-\nliantly dever; and genuine orchestral music.' Of Elgar's subsequent works,\nParry greatly admired Coclcaigne, parts of The Apostles. the Introduction and\nAllegro, the Violin Concerto ('after my own heart') and Falstaff, but he was\nunconvinced by the over-tessellated leitmotivic scheme of The Kingdom in\nwhich, he noted, 'the mosaic-like juxtaposition of thematic bits jars and\nbewilders', t6 and he thoroughly disliked the sentiment of The Music Makers\nand The Spirit ofEngland. As for the symphonies, he began by being deeply\nimpressed by the First, the London premiere of which he attended (along\nwith most ofthe capital's distinguished musical society) on 7 December 1908\nat Queen's Hall. 'Place packed. Work received with enthusiasm. Very inter-\nesting, personal, new, magnetic. A lofty standard', was his firsl response.\"\n20 Jeremy Dibble\nBut repeated performances emphasised an emotional abandon (and one\nsuspects a thematic over-concentration) uncongenial to Parry's classical\ninclinations, and, though he admired the orchestral technique of the Sec-\nond Symphony, he was to find this work 'blatant and vulgar: I.\nThe surviving documentary evidence confirms that Elgar returned\nParry's admiration. With the publication of Grove's Dictionary of Music\nand Musicians between 1879 and 1889 Elgar learned much from Parry's\narticles.\" We know too that, besides his practical experience of Parry's\nmusic as a violinist, he also keenly followed Parry's progress as a composer,\nmaking a special note ofhearing the premiere of Parry's Fourth Symphony\nunder Richter on 1July 1889, only weeks after settling in Kensington with his\nnew wife. After Elgar's rise to fame at the end of the 189Os, he continued to\nbe a student of Parry's music. 'CHHP Job' appears below a discarded sketch\nin Part One of Gerontius (the Litany),20 and a letter to Parry of27 May 1903,\nwhile Elgar was working on The Apostles, exhibits Elgar's dependence on\nParry's knowledge of word-setting. Further gestures of approbation were\nshown in Elgar's performances of Parry's The Lotus-Eaters and the Ode to\nMusic with the Worcestershire Philharmonic and, in 1904, in gratitude 'for\nan act of friendly intervention on Parry's part', Elgar offered to take on any\ntasks of drudgery for his friend, 'anything in fact that an ordinary copyist\ncould or could not quite do, 1 would take the greatest pride and pleasure\nin doing it for you'.21 After Parry had successfully agitated for Elgar's hon-\norary D. Mus. at Oxford, Elgar was particularly delighted by the university's\ninvitation, because, as he expounded in a lettet to Patry in January 1905, 'it\npermits me, in some slight way, to become associated with your name for\none glorified moment ... 1only wrote this to thank you and to say that the\ndegree would come as a doubly pleasant thing now, in view ofmy taking up\nthe Peyton Professorship at Birmingham.''' When Elgar appeared for the\nfirst time in his official capacity at Birmingham, he used the opportunity of\nhis inaugural lecture to heap praise upon his older contemporary with the\naccolade 'the head ofour art in this country.\u00b72)\nElgar's lecture may have been flattering to Parry, but its criticisms\nof British music and the British composer angered both Stanford and\nMackenzie. Indeed, in Stanford's case, the Birmingham lectures were to\nprove a decisive watershed in his professional association with Elgar. It was\nwith the publication of King Olafthat Stanford became aware ofElgar's gifts,\nand his enthusiasm for the younger man's music was quickly passed on to\nMackenzie.2< As a regular visitor to Malvern, Stanford took the opportu-\nnity to be better acquainted with Elgar during the RCM vacations. Stanford\nplayed Elgar the wholeofhis new Requiem for the 1897 Birmingham Festival;\nand Elgar heard Stanford's Shamus O'Brien when it was touring in Worcestet.\nStanford directed performances of King Olaf, the 'Enigma' Variations. the\n21 Elgar and his British \",ntemporaries\nSea Piaur... and Cockaigne at the RCM and Leeds,2s and besides other gen-\nerous personal gestures, such as his role (and Parry's) in Elgar's successful\nelection to the Athenaeum Club on 12 April 1904, he agitated vigorously\nfor Elgar's honorary doctorate at Cambridge University in 1900 as 'the most\nprominent and the most brilliant of the younger generation;'\" and lobbied\nElgar on more than one occasion for new works.27 Yet, the letters between\nElgar and Jaeger overwhelmingly reveal that Elgar liked neither Stanford\nnor his music. He mistrusted the Irishman's overt ambition and political\nconniving (especially on behalfof his own pupils), and there was always the\nlingering sense of inferiority, he the non-intellectual and Stanford the uni-\nversity professor. Elgar's ill-judged comments in his first two Birmingham\nlectures (rightly described by Kennedy as an 'insensitive blunder')'>' which\nStanford clearly believed were aimed at him, were an unpardonable insult.\nAn estrangement ensued until 1922 when Granville Bantock effected a rec-\nonciliation between the two men; Elgar, however, always claimed ignorance\nof the reason for their estrangement.\nWith Caradaeus, the Variations, and Gerontius Elgar eclipsed the\nachievements of his ~nior contemporaries. Moreover, Parry, Stanford and\nMackenzie were only too well aware of the neglect of their own music by\nBritain's chiefconductors (especially Richter, Henry Wood, and Cowen) as\nElgar came to the fore. Richard Strauss's eulogy ofElgar, as the 'first English\nprogressivist; also placed him in the vanguard ofmodern British music and\ngave him an almost iconic status in the eyes of the younger generation,\nnotably Holst and Vaughan Williams.29 Of these Elgar took a particular\ninterest in the music of William Hurlstone (whose Variations on a Swedish\nAir he greatly admired), and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who had received\nJaeger's ringing endorsement.\" Elgar's encouragement ofColeridge-Taylor\ntook the form of a recommendation to the 1898 Gloucester Festival for a\nnew orchestral work - the Ballade in A minor. This, along with Hiawatha's\nWedding Feast, premiered at the RCM under Stanford on II November\nthe same year, and which Elgar attended, were instrumental in forging\nColeridge-Taylor's meteoric rise to fame. With the success of Hiawatha and\nthe Ballade, Taylor rapidly began to attract commissions, at which point\nElgar appears to have abandoned his initial enthusiasm for bitter criticism.\nBy 190I, Taylor's cantata The Blind Girl ofeasul-Cuillt, written for leeds,\nwas dismissed as 'cheap' and 'flung off to degrade the choral singing of\nthe country',\" while The Alonemen~ composed for Hereford in 1903, was\ncondemned as 'a disgrace to any civilised country' which rudely exposed\nTaylor's 'utter wanl ofeducation'.\" Some have attributed this volte-face as\na sign of Elgar's insecurity and aversion to competition.\nOthers that Elgar chose to support, particularly those with a predilection\nfor Richard Strauss, were Granville Bantock (who was considered by many\n22 Jeremy Dibble\ncritics to be more progressive than Elgar), Percy Pitt, W. H. Bell, Cyril Scott,\nand Josef Holbrooke. As a self-styled rebel and radical, Bantock professed\nhimself the foe of academia (a stance which chimed with Elgar's own). He\npursued his radicalism (with the help of William Wallace) as conductor\nof the municipal orchestra at New Brighton, using the venue to promote\nconcerts of new British music. A programme of Elgar took place there\non 16 July 1899 and sparked a lifelong friendship between the two men.\nElgar promoted Bantock's own music (including such works as the Russian\nScenes and Dante and Beatrice) and used his influence to secure Bantock's\nappointment as Principal ofthe Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1901\n(in spite of Bantock's antipathy to academia). In tum Bantock appointed\nElgar as official Visitor to the Institute and succeeded him as Peyton Professor\nat Birmingham University in 1908.\nTile perception of Elgar as the leader of a new musical 'modernism' in\nBritain was forged by his appointment as president of the Musical League,\nan organisation spearheaded by Delius and Bantock (with the support of\nHenry Wood, Percy Grainger, Norman O'Neill, Arnold Bax, Havergal Brian,\nand Pitt) to promote the music of less well-known British composers.\"\nDelius's contact with Elgar was no more than intermittent. They had briefly\nworked together as adjudicators for the Norwich Festival in 1907 and had\nmet in London the same year while ideas for the Musical League were being\ndiscussed. Elgar's music, however, was never congenial to Delius, who, as\nan iconoclast, atheist, republican, and socialist, was diametrically and tem-\nperamentally opposite to Elgar's politically conservative disposition. Delius\nreserved some appreciation for the l\"troduetio\" and Allegro and Falstaff, but\nhe was intrinsically antipathetic to Elgar's oratorios and symphonies, and\ndisliked his 'thick' orchestration.\nAs has often been noted, the end ofthe First World War, which coincided\nwith the death of Parry, signalled a sea-change in British musical reception.\nA rejection of the country's Victorian and Edwardian musical legacy did\nnot immediately lead to the neglect of Elgar's music (as it did of Parry's,\nStanford's and Mackenzie's), but Elgar himself was undoubtedly aware that\npublic attention had shifted elsewhere. In January 1922, Elgar entertained\nRichard Strauss to lunch in order to meet a group ofyounger English com-\nposers, among them, Ireland, Bax, Bliss, Goossens, and Rutland Boughton,\nand, through the offices of Ethel Smyth, he lent support to the knighthood\nof Dan GodfnJY' conductor of the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra. Yet,\nElgar was wary of Britain's post-war musical development. He disliked the\nmusic of Vaughan Williams and Holst, and was openly hostile towards the\nworks of Bliss and Goossens at the Three Choirs Festival in 1922,34 though\nhe did express some enthusiasm for Constant Lambert's Rio Grande and the\nwork of Bax.\u00bb In 1924 there was a debate in court circles as to who would\n23 Elgar and his British contemporaries\nsucceed Sir Walter Parratt as Master of the King's Music. In a nationalist\nenvironment where Vaughan Williams's assimilation of folk song was con-\nsidered more representative, Elgar's 'German methods' were clearly thought\nto be a negative factor; but in the end Elgar's fame and achievement (and,\nironically, Hugh Allen's recommendation from the Royal College ofMusic),\nwere crucial to his eventual appointment.36\nIn the last years of Elgar's life, which witnessed a degree of rejuvenation\nin his composing activities, not least with the commissions of the Nursery\nSuite, the Pomp and Circumstance March No.5 and the Third Symphony,\nas well as the public interest in his music generated by the newly emerging\nrecording industry, Elgar's association with the younger generation appears\nto have been replaced by a retreat into nostalgia and a solidarity with his\nolder contemporaries. He is known to have admonished Vaughan Williams\nfor his criticism of Parry's orchestration of the Symphonic Variations;\"\nhe paid tribute to Mackenzie in an article for a Worcester publication, the\nThree Pears Magazinc, and was instrumental in recommending Bantock's\nknighthood in 1930. He also appears to have drawn much comfort from\nhis correspondence with Cowen, on whose advice he had relied early on in\nhis career. Elgar lamented that the present generation undervalued Cowen's\ncontribution as a conductor.31 and\" at an after-dinner s~ch on Cowen's\neightieth birthday in 1932, he described Cowen as 'a dominating factor in the\nmusical life of this country since 1875:.19 More fully documented, however,\nwas Elgar's visit to Delius on 30 May 1933, which arose as an interlude\nbetween the rehearsals and the French premiere of Elgar's Violin Concerto\nwith the young Yehudi Menuhin. It was a curiously providential meeting\n(which Elgar reported in the Daily Telegraph and Fenby summarised in\nDelius as 1Knew Him), for the following year the deaths ofboth men (which\nflanked the premature deaths of Holst and O'Neill) would signal the end of\nan era, though it would be with the deaths of Mackenzie and Cowen in 1935\nthat links with a past age would finally dissolve.\n"}
