INTRODUCTION\nNowadays a power supply is required to have high efficiency over the whole load range. An off-line power supply\nis often required to meet target efficiencies at 20% load, 50% load and 100% load [1]. As light load efficiency\nis becoming important alongside full load efficiency, developing a systematic way to design a power supply that\nDRAFT\n4meets the efficiency requirements over a wide load range is desirable. Design through optimization is one of the\napproaches to achieve these requirements.\nOptimization for power electronic systems has been proposed for more than 30 years, and it has drawn attention\nfrom both academic and industrial fields. Generally speaking, the optimization of a power electronics system\nconsists of several objective functions, for examples, efficiency, mass or cost models, with several constraints, such\nas temperature, mass or efficiencies. Optimization programs search a set of solutions and produce global or local\noptimal solutions. The number of converter design variables is often large. The variables are discrete and continuous.\nThis presents challenges to optimize the infinitely many design combinations.\nEarly research work [2] utilized conventional optimization techniques, such as the sequential unconstrained\nminimization technique (SUMT) or the augmented Lagrangian (ALAG) penalty function technique, to optimize\nthe converter mass. Design constraints were included into the optimization program. As an extension of [2], half-\nbridge converter optimization using a penalty function [3] was proposed to optimize the converter mass. Detailed\nconverter optimization results are presented. A practical converter optimization approach suitable for industrial\napplication was developed [4]. It utilized the nonlinear optimization program to optimize converter design, and both\nthe optimization procedures and results were suitable from the point of applications.\nA new insight into optimizing the buck converter power circuit and control parameters simultaneously has been\npresented [5]. It utilized a weighted objective function to solve the multi-objective optimization problems. The\nobjective function was defined as a weighted sum of structural objectives, such as mass, price, and controller-\nrelated objectives. Efficiencies were set to be constraints to be satisfied in the required converter design. However,\nthe optimization solutions are highly dependent on the weighting factors. Trial-and-error cannot be avoided. A\ngradient based constrained optimization of a fuel cell converter was presented in [6], with the trade-offs between\nefficiency and converter mass of optimized design given in graphs.\nWith the development of probabilistic optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithms (GA), many opti-\nmization applications on power electronics system design have been reported. On the basis that power electronics\nsystem design variables can be considered as discrete, a GA based algorithm was applied to a boost a power\nDRAFT\n5factor correction converter to optimize the converter cost [7]. The design results have a lower implementation cost\nwhen compared with conventional designs satisfying the same specifications. Buck converter transient optimization\ndesign has been presented [8], also using GA. A Monte Carlo search method was developed to optimize the volume\nof an interleave converter for automobile applications [9]. The interleaved converters have more design variables\nthan a single converter, and the optimization improvement of results seem more significant than a single converter\noptimization. Passive component optimization has been shown [10], in which a GA was applied to optimize the\nfront-end rectifier passive components for inverters.\nThe idea of Pareto-front in multi-object optimization was investigated in power converter design [11]. The Pareto\u2013\nfront of converter volume and efficiency means no further efficiency improvement can be achieved under a limited\nconverter volume. Converter volume and efficiency were included in the weighted objective function to determine\nthe degree of optimized efficiency or volume. The Pareto-front curve of power density versus efficiency showed that\nthe optimized efficiency was limited by a certain volume constraint. A similar optimization approach was applied\nto phase-shift PWM converter design [12] to achieve 99% efficiency. Light load efficiency was considered in the\noptimization procedures.\nFrom an optimization point of view, the objective functions in power converter design are often multi-object and\nnon-convex in nature, with nonlinear constraints involving continuous and discrete variables. In practical converter\ndesign optimization, we should also consider the sensitivity of every design variable, e.g. switching frequency, flux\ndensity swing or duty cycle. Changes in these variables might influence the converter performance from light load\nto full load.\nIn this paper, instead of using a probabilistic algorithm mentioned earlier, we employ a deterministic algorithm to\noptimize power converter design, since the deterministic algorithms can provide more systematic way on parameter\ncontrolling. A two\u2013FET forward converter efficiency optimization example is studied in this research. To solve\nthe multi-objective optimization problem, the weighted objective function is popular for use with weighting factors\nspecified by the designer. However, there are numerous combinations of the weighting factors, and the desirable\ncombination is hard to determine. Trial-and-error cannot be avoided in the optimization processes. In this paper, a\ntwo\u2013stage optimization procedure is proposed to optimize converter efficiency over a wide range. The optimization\nDRAFT\n6procedure first divides the converter design process into many switching frequency branches. In each switching\nfrequency branch, the optimal designs for 20%, 50% and 100% load are derived separately in the first stage, and\nan objective function is formed in the second stage to consider efficiencies optimization over the three loads.\nIn the paper, component efficiency models and analyzes are established in Section II. The overall optimization\nstructure, including the two-stage optimization procedure, is presented in Section III. Optimization results and\nexperimental results are illustrated in Section IV. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section V.\nII. COMPONENT LOSS MODELS\nIn this section, simplified component models are established for losses analyses. Simplified models are desirable\nas they reduce computational complexity of optimization, and enhance parameter controlling. The conventional\ntwo-FET forward topology, which is widely used in desktop power supply, is selected as an example of converter\nefficiency optimization. The circuit topology is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the losses breakdown of a 300W\ntwo-FET forward converter which is optimized for full load; the distributions of losses from light load to full load\nare presented. A typical efficiency curve of the example converter is shown in Fig. 3.\nIn a conventional off-line power converter, design optimization can help improve the efficiency over a wide\nload range. The components are pre-selected before the optimization procedure. Primary MOSFETs, an isolation\ntransformer, synchronous rectifiers and an inductor are the major components determining the converter efficiency.\nTo reduce the computation complexity, yet still fulfilling the accuracy of efficiency prediction, 7 design variables\nare used to optimize converter efficiency. The design variables are summarized in TABLE I. Note that transformer\nwindings and inductor windings are calculated according to such design variables.\nTo calculate the component loss, the converter operating point will be derived. In the following analyses, we\nfirst assume that the converter operation is ideal. The number of primary and secondary turns can be calculated\naccording to (1) and (2). Here, we prefer to use the duty and flux swing rather than the number of turns as the\ndesign variables, mainly because they can express the converter and magnetic characteristics from a design point\nof view. To calculate the harmonics of the current, a numerical method is used to sample a switching cycle with\nnsample points (nsample = 256 in this case) and construct the key current\/voltage waveform numerically, as shown\nDRAFT\n7in Fig. 4. The magnetic current is also included in the calculation. The set of governing equations is listed from\n(1) to (8). The harmonics of the transformer current are calculated by fast Fourier transform in order to calculate\ncopper loss of the transformer, also shown in Fig. 4.\nD =\nVoutNs\nVinNp\n(1)\nBm =\nVinTon\nNpAe\n=\nVinDTs\nNpAe\n=\nVout\nNsAefs\n(2)\nNs =\nVout\nBmAefs\n(3)\nNp =\nNsVout\nDVin\n(4)\nIL rip =\n(NsNpVin \u0000 Vout)D\nfsL\n(5)\nIm =\nVinD\nfsLm\n(6)\nIpri on =\nNs\nNp\n(Iout \u0000 IL rip=2) (7)\nIpri off =\nNs\nNp\n(Iout + IL rip=2) + Im (8)\nA. Primary MOSFET\nIn a hard switching converter, accurate prediction of switching loss is important for optimization. Complete\nMOSFET switching models [13] [14], which include semiconductor characteristics, are complicated and the com-\nputational complexity will be dramatically increased. A simple and effective MOSFET switching loss model is\ndesirable for the prediction of the switching loss from light load to full load. It should be noted that at full load\ncondition under which the turn-off current is large, the switching loss is much higher than light load condition\n[13]. At light load condition, the turn-off current is small, the major loss is capacitive loss. As shown in Fig. 5, for\nMOSFET IPP50R140CP, the region under which turn-off loss is \u201cflat\u201d is below 5A; for IPP50R520CP, the \u201cflat\u201d\nregion is below 2A. A curve fitting method is employed to record the SPICE simulation results. We can then obtain\nsimple yet effective switching loss estimates. The turn-off energy consumed by primary MOSFETs is given by (9)\nwith parameters summarized in TABLE II; we fixed the input voltage at 370 V in SPICE simulation.\nDRAFT\n8Eoff (Ipri off ) =\n8>>><>>>:\na1e\nb1Ipri off + a2e\nb2Ipri off if Ipri off \u0015 C1,\nEoff (C1) if Ipri off < C1.\n(9)\nIt should be noted that during turn\u2013off, there are two currents flowing through the MOSFET and the total energy\nvalue is Eoff (Ipri off ). One current is to charge the output capacitance of MOSFET to Vin with the energy\n1=2CPri oss(er)V\n2\nin = Eoff (C1) (assuming CPri oss(er) is constant to simplify calculation), the other current\nproduces energy dissipation in the MOSFET channel with the energy Eoff (Ipri off )\u0000Eoff (C1). Before turn\u2013on,\npart of the energy stored in the output capacitance of MOSFET is recovered to the input capacitor (the Vds of\nMOSFET drops from Vin to 1=2Vin, this is particular for two-FET forward topology). During turn\u2013on, the energy\nstored in the output capacitance 1=2CPri oss(er)(1=2Vin)2 = 1=4Eoff (C1) is discharged . The actual energy\ndissipated during switching is the energy dissipated in the MOSFET channel during turn\u2013off Eoff (Ipri off ) \u0000\nEoff (C1), plus the energy dissipated by discharging the output capacitance during turn\u2013on 1=4Eoff (C1).\nSimplified primary MOSFET switching loss of a two-FET forward converter can be expressed in (10). The\nconduction loss of primary MOSFET are given by (11).\nPpri sw = fs[Eoff (Ipri off )\u0000 Eoff (C1) + 14Eoff (C1)] (10)\nPpri cond = Rpri dsonI\n2\npri rms (11)\nB. Isolation Transformer\nTransformer design is one of the key steps in achieving good efficiency both at light load and full load. The\ntransformer loss models are presented in this part. The accuracy of existing models has been shown in previous\nresearch [15] [16], indicating that the models are reliable for predicting transformer loss. Analytical optimized\ntransformer design was also reviewed by [17].\nThe empirical Steinmetz equation [18] is given by (12) and its related parameters are provided by the manufacturer\nto predict core loss [19].\nPcore = Vekf\n\u000b\neq\u0001B\n\f (12)\nDRAFT\n9For a unidirectional flux operation, the flux density swing is given by (13). feq is the equivalent frequency for a\nPWM converter [16], given by (14).\n\u0001B = Bm=2 (13)\nfeq =\n2\n\u00192\nfs\n1\nD(1\u0000D) (14)\nThe use of Dowell\u2019s Equations [20] is a one-dimensional approach to predict transformer AC resistance, and it\nis applied in this work. Round wires are applied to the primary side and copper foils to the secondary side, as\nshown in Fig. 6. DC resistance can be directly calculated by the winding geometry. The AC copper loss at each\nharmonic frequency can be calculated by summing the loss at each harmonics; here we take the sum up to the\n32nd harmonics. The ratio of AC-DC resistance on the transformer primary side is given by (15).\nFRn pri(p;X) = X\ne2X \u0000 e\u00002X + 2 sin(2X)\ne2X + e\u00002X \u0000 2 cos(2X) + 2X\np2 \u0000 1\n3\neX \u0000 e\u0000X \u0000 2 sin(X)\neX + e\u0000X + 2 cos(X)\n(15)\nwhere X = hfoil\u000e is for foils and X =\np\n\u0019dAWG\n2\u000e is for round conductors [21].\nThe transformer primary side copper loss are given by (16). The secondary side transformer copper loss Psec copper\ncan also be calculated using the same method, see (17). The transformer loss can be expressed as the sum of core\nloss and copper loss.\nPpri copper = Rpri dc\n32X\nn=0\nFRn priI\n2\nn pri\n(16)\nPsec copper = Rsec dc\n32X\nn=0\nFRn secI\n2\nn sec\n(17)\nC. Synchronous Rectifier\nSynchronous rectification (SR) is implemented at the secondary side to achieve high efficiency at the low-voltage-\nhigh-current output condition. The current driven synchronous rectifier driving scheme has been implemented in\nthis research work [22]. The major losses for the synchronous rectifier are conduction loss, turn-off switching loss\n[23] and gate driving loss.\nTurn-off switching loss and gate driving loss are almost constant from 20% load to 100% load. Turn-off switching\nloss can be simplified [23], with the energy stored in the stray inductance being dissipated by the resistive parts of\nDRAFT\n10\nthe circuit, such as PCB routes and transformer windings. The reverse recovery charge is ignored in the calculation.\nThe simplified model for turn-off loss and gate driving loss of SR are given by (18) and (19).\nPSR sw =\n1\n2VTQossfs (18)\nPSR gate = QSR gateVgfs (19)\nThe conduction loss of SR is given by (20). The body diode conduction loss during dead time is described in (21).\nPSR cond = I\n2\nSR RMSRSR on (20)\nPSR bd = Vf (Iout \u0000 IL rip=2)td onfs + Vf (Iout + IL rip=2)td offfs (21)\nwhere td on and td off are the turn-on and turn-off dead-times of the synchronous rectifier. Since a synchronous\nrectifier conducts in the reverse manner, the body diode conducts before the synchronous rectifier is turned on.\nHence, zero voltage turn-on can be achieved in a synchronous rectifier.\nD. Output Inductor\nThe output inductor is also a critical component in an off\u2013line PWM power converter since the secondary side\noutput current is large. A gapped ferrite core is selected to be the inductor core because core loss of ferrite material\nare relatively low and it has better light load efficiency.\nThe inductance characteristics can be expressed as follows:\nB\nMAX\n=\nLIL MAX\nNLAL g\n(22)\nkL cuAL win = NLNLllAL AWG (23)\nRL dc =\n\u001acuNLlMLT\nNLllAL AWG\n(24)\nBy inserting (22) and (23) into (24), the inductor DC resistance is as (25):\nRL dc =\n\u001aculMNTL\n2I2\nL MAX\nkL cuAL winB2MAXA\n2\nL g\n(25)\nThe required gap length is given by (26).\nlL g =\n\u00160AL gNL\n2\nL\n(26)\nIt can be implied by (25) that the DC resistance of the inductor is proportional to the square of the inductor\nvalue. Since the current ripple of the output inductor is smooth, the frequency harmonics is summed up to the 5th\nharmonics to calculate the copper loss of the inductor, given by (27).\nDRAFT\n11\nPL copper = RL dc\n5X\nn=0\nFRn LI\n2\nn L\n(27)\nThe flux density swing of the output inductor is given by (28), and the core loss of the inductor can be expressed\nusing the Steinmetz equation (29).\n\u0001BL =\nLIL rip\n2NLAL g\n(28)\nPL core = VL ekfeq\n\u000b\u0001BL\n\f (29)\nE.

OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE\nA two-stage optimization procedure is proposed to systematically optimize the power converter efficiency over\na wide load range, as shown in Fig. 7. The description of the two-stage optimization procedure is presented in this\nsection. The optimization procedure involves breaking the converter design into many fixed switching frequency\nbranches in order to avoid the optimizer being trapped at some local minima. This will be further explained in\nPart A of this section. At each frequency, a two-stage procedure is developed. In Stage I, the best efficiencies for\n20%, 50% and 100% load are found separately by the optimizer. In this stage, the problem is a single-objective\noptimization. To cater for the multi-objective optimization, a second stage is used. In Stage II, the three optimized\nefficiency values at 20%, 50% and 100% load established in Stage I become the reference points for optimizing\nDRAFT\n12\nthe converter efficiency over a wide range. The final design efficiency should be as close to the best efficiency in\nStage I as possible. A function which aims to optimize the converter efficiency over 20%, 50% and 100% load is\nformulated. A detailed explanation of these stages is given in Part B of this section.\nThe optimization program in this paper is developed under the MATLAB environment. The fmincon(x) function\nof MATLAB optimization toolbox is applied as the optimizer to solve the non-linear constrained optimization\nproblems. The \u201cactive-set\u201d algorithm is used in the fmincon(x) function. Detailed optimization procedures can\nbe found in [24].\nThe characteristics of the power components are discrete, such as primary MOSFET, transformer core and\nbobbin size. The continuous optimization methods cannot handle such discrete values, so we pre-select the discrete\ncomponents at the discrete component selection stage. In the continuous optimization stage, the discrete components\nand their related parameters are fixed.\nA. Fixed Switching Frequency Branches\nIt is an issue whether to set the switching frequency to be a variable in the gradient search optimization or not.\nWhen the switching frequency varies over a range, the optimization solutions maybe trapped at the initial switching\nfrequency point, which is regarded as a the local minimum. This problem was also reported in previous research\n[2], [4], [25]. In order to avoid the optimization to be trapped at the local minima, the switching frequency is kept\nconstant in each optimization branch. This allows us to avoid the solution to be trapped at the local minimum.\nThe final optimized results are a set of design variables at different constant switching frequencies, ranging from\n50 kHz to 250 kHz. Hence, a constant switching frequency sub-optimization was developed, as shown in the flow\nchart Fig. 7.\nThe local minima problem caused by switching frequency is shown in Fig. 8. In this case the switching frequency\nis set to be a variable in the gradient search optimization process. Starting from different initial points, the converged\nresults give Optm50% (minimizing the losses at 50% load). The local minima are clearly shown in Fig. 8. The 50%\nload losses are also very close at these two local minima.\nWhile considering the optimizing efficiency from light load to full load, the influence of the switching frequency\nDRAFT\n13\nis significant. In a constant switching frequency PWM converter, a reasonable switching frequency should be chosen.\nHigh switching frequency produces more switching loss for semiconductor devices. Low switching frequency needs\nmore winding in the transformer to suppress increasing core loss, hence, increasing the copper loss. The optimized\ndesign for each switching frequency has been recorded in each switching frequency branch.\nB. Two-Stage Optimization\nHere we aim to optimize the converter efficiency from 20% load to 100% load, subject to efficiency constraints.\nThis is a typical multi-objective optimization problem. One conventional method is to use the weighted objective\nfunction approach. However, the weighting factors are fixed before the optimization results are found and trial-and-\nerror is still needed to determine the suitable weighting factors. A two-stage optimization procedure is presented\nto handle such an optimization problem, as depicted in the flow chart Fig. 7. The optimization procedures are\ndescribed below.\nLet x denote a vector containing all the design variables, such as flux swing, duty and diameter of transformer\nwire and etc. given by (33). The switching frequency is set to be constant in each optimization branch.\nx = (Bm; D; dAWG; nlayer; hfoil; L) (33)\nThe lower bound vector and upper bound vector of the design variables are given by (34), where the expression\n\u201cx\u0000 bxl \u0015\u0015 0\u201d denotes \u201cx\u0000 bxl\u201d to be a vector with non-negative entries.8>>><>>>:\nx\u0000 bxl \u0015\u0015 0\nbxu \u0000 x \u0015\u0015 0\n(34)\nThe 20% load converter efficiency \u001120% under a constant switching frequency is given by (35):\n\u001120%(x) =\nPout(Iout)\nPout(Iout) + Plosses(x)\nj fs=Cfs\nIout=0:2IMAX\n(35)\nSimilar expressions are formulated for \u001150% and \u0011100%.\nStage I:\nThe aim of this stage is to identify the optimal efficiency at each load point through a single object optimization.\nOptm20% = arg max\nx2\n1\n\u001120%(x) jfs=Cfs (36)\nDRAFT\n14\nwhere the Optm20% is the argument to optimize 20% load efficiency, the constraint set \n1 is given by (37):\n\n1 = fx j x\u0000 bxl \u0015\u0015 0; bxu \u0000 x \u0015\u0015 0g (37)\nThe optimized 20% load converter design given by (36) is aimed at optimizing the 20% load efficiency only. This\ndesign may not give good efficiency at 50% and 100% load. Optm20%, however, is a reference point for further\noptimization in Stage II. It can also provide a guideline for the efficiency to be expected during 20% load condition\nunder the specified switching frequency. The same process is repeated for Optm50% and Optm100%.\nStage II:\nForm the following objective function:\nf(x) = [Optm20% \u0000 \u001120%(x)]2 + [Optm50% \u0000 \u001150%(x)]2 + [Optm100% \u0000 \u0011100%(x)]2 (38)\nand consider the optimization problem:\nmin\nx2\n2\nf(x) (39)\nwhere the constraint set \n2 is given by (40).\n\n2 = fx j x\u0000 bxl \u0015\u0015 0; bxu \u0000 x \u0015\u0015 0; \u001120%(x) \u0015 C\u001120%; \u001150%(x) \u0015 C\u001150%; \u0011100%(x) \u0015 C\u0011100%g (40)\nIn Stage II, the objective function f(x) is formulated as the sum of squares of the departures of the design\nobjectives (\u001120%(x); \u001150%(x); \u0011100%(x)) from (Optm20%; Optm50%; Optm100%). If one of the departures is larger\nthan the others, it will be amplified by squaring. Thus, more penalties will be imposed for large departure from\nthe target value, causing the optimizer to suppress the amplified departure. The optimized solution is as close as\npossible to three reference points. The optimizer establishes the minimum value of f(x) in each switching frequency\nbranch.\nDRAFT\n15\nIV. OPTIMIZATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. OPTIMIZATION RESULTS\nThe results of optimization are presented in this part. An example of optimization is given under the fixed\nswitching frequency of 200 kHz. Design variables to optimize for Optm20%, Optm50% and Optm100% are presented\nin TABLE IV. Similar optimization procedures are carried out for frequency in the range from 50 kHz to 250 kHz,\nwith an interval of 10 kHz.\nThere are three series of designs in Fig. 9, namely the Optm20% series, the Optm50% series, and the Optm100%\nseries. In each series, optimal designs are produced in the frequency range from 50 to 250 kHz, with an interval\nof 10 kHz. For example, each point in the Optm20% series represents a converter design. This series gives a set of\nconverter designs for the entire frequency range. The Optm20% series is optimized for 20% converter load and the\n20% load efficiencies are shown in Fig. 9 (a). The designs in this series are then put to 50% converter load and\nthe corresponding efficiencies are shown in Fig. 9 (b). In Fig. 9 (c), the series are put to 100% converter load and\nresults are shown in similar manner.\nIt can be indicated from Fig. 9 (c) that the Optm20% series has lower efficiencies at the full load condition for\nthe entire switching frequency range. The Optm100% series also cannot provide the best efficiencies at 20% load\ncondition. Also, small efficiency differences have been observed between Optm20% and Optm50% at 20% load.\nThe efficiency differences between Optm100% and Optm50% are also small at 100% load condition. So it is not\nthe best strategy only to optimize power converter full load efficiency or light load efficiency.\nDetailed two-stage optimization results are shown in TABLE V, at switching frequency 50, 100, 150 and 200\nkHz. TABLE V shows that higher switching frequency produces lower 20% load efficiency. From 50 kHz to 100\nkHz, there is 1.1% efficiency improvement at full load and 0.3% efficiency improvement at middle load, with 0.6%\nefficiency sacrifice at light load condition. The 20% load efficiency of 200 kHz design is 1.6% less than that of\nthe 100 kHz design. At full load, the 200 kHz design is only 0.3% more efficient than the 100 kHz design. This\nefficiency gain of 0.3% does not justify the 1.6% efficiency drop at light load. 100 kHz is chosen to be the ultimate\ndesign, since it produces the best 50% load efficiency, and the second best 20% load efficiency. The full load\nDRAFT\n16\nefficiency is ranked third among four designs. However, the 95.2% full load efficiency of 100 kHz design is still\nclose enough to 95.5% of 200 kHz design and 1.1% efficiency higher than 94.1% of 50 kHz design.\nFurther analyzes of 100 kHz design are presented in Fig. 10. If the design is to optimize full load efficiency\nonly, there is a large departure (about 1%) at 20% load compared with Optm20%. When the optimizations are\naimed over wide load range using the proposed two-stage method, the departures from the best values Optm20%\nand Optm100% are small (both about 0.2\u20130.3%). Thus, optimization for wide load range is more desirable than\noptimizing full load efficiency only.\nB. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTwo two-FET forward converters are built to verify the optimization results. One converter is designed to optimize\nthe efficiency over a wide load range. The other is designed to optimize the full load efficiency only. The converters\nhave the same specifications. The input voltage is 370 V, output voltage is 12 V loading from 0 to 25 A. Current mode\ncontroller UC3844 is implemented on primary side. Current driven synchronous rectifiers are used on secondary\nside. The circuit parameters are summarized in TABLE VI. The converter schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 11.\nThe comparison of predicted efficiency optimized for wide load range and its corresponding experimental results\nare shown in Fig. 12. The predicted results match the experimental results from light load to full load. The loss\nmodels are only approximation of the true losses that some non-linear effects are not fully captured in these models.\nThe converter 50% and 100% load efficiencies are higher than 95% and the 20% load efficiency is above 92%,\nwhich illustrate the merit of efficiency optimization.\nThe efficiencies of the two prototype converters are compared in Fig. 13. The efficiency of wide load range\ndesign is 1% better than that of full load design at 20% load. On the other hand, the full load efficiency of wide\nload range design is 0.4% lower than the efficiency of full load design. The converter 20% load efficiency can be\nincreased by optimization without much sacrifice of the full load efficiency.\nDRAFT\n17\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nA two-stage optimization procedure to optimize the power converter efficiency from light load to full load is\nproposed. The optimization procedure first breaks the converter design variables into many switching frequency\nbranches. In a fixed switching frequency branch, the optimal designs for 20%, 50% and 100% load are obtained\nseparately in the first stage, and an objective function using the results in first stage is formed in the second stage\nto consider efficiencies optimization over light, medium, and full loads. Efficiency models of power components\nare established and implemented into the objective function. The proposed optimization procedure determines the\noptimal efficiency design that fit the efficiency requirements over a wide load range. Optimization results are\npresented with analyzes over a selected switching frequency range from light load to full load. Two two-FET\nforward converters example are built and compared as a mean to the verify power converter efficiency optimization.\nThe medium and full load efficiencies are higher than 95%, which illustrate the optimization method can design\nefficient power converters. Through the optimization, the converter 20% load efficiency can be increased without\nmuch sacrificing of the full load efficiency.\nDRAFT\n18\nREFERENCES\n[1] \u201cESOS Plug Load Solutions\u201d, Avaible: www.80plus.org\n[2] S.
