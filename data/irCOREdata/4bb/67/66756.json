MONARCHY AND\nANTI-MONARCHY IN BRITAIN, 1760\u20131901*\nDAV ID M. CRA IG\nUniversity of Durham\nA B S T R ACT. In the last two decades historians have been increasingly interested in the modernization of the\nmonarchy, and the nature of the republican threat. This review evaluates some of this recent literature. The first\nsection argues that whileWalter Bagehot\u2019s views about ceremony inThe English constitution (1867) have\ninfluenced historical writing, these approaches do not yield much information about what the monarchy actually\nmeant to people. The second section turns to the political powers of the monarchy, and examines the wide\nrange of views about what the constitutional limits of royal power were. It also shows that even radical writers\nwere often unable to dispel the monarchy from their imaginations. Finally, the review suggests that criticism of\nthe royal family was not necessarily republican, and arose more from concern that particular figures were failing\nto conform to shared public values. Pure republicans were few, and did not usually focus their energies on the\nmonarchy, but rather on the nature of parliamentary representation and the power of the Lords.\nOn the morning of 31 August 1997 Tony Blair spoke to the media outside Trimdon parish\nchurch about the tragic events earlier that day. His words on the death of Diana, princess of\nWales, are now considered to be a masterpiece of political theatre which captured (or\nperhaps created) the \u2018mood of the nation\u2019. Diana, he intoned, had been loved by \u2018the\npeople \u2019 because she was the \u2018People\u2019s Princess \u2019. Although coined neither by Blair, nor his\npress secretary Alistair Campbell,1 the phrase starkly reveals the paradoxes of monarchy in\nthe modern world. They were dramatically played out in the week leading up to the funeral\non 6 September. As oceans of flowers spread across central London, sentiment and rev-\nerence were publicly paraded, and even some avowed republicans found themselves caught\nup in themood. The irony of this emotional outburst was that Diana was a royal outcast with\na loyal following. The initial refusal of the royal family to participate in the commemoration\nof her death led to public anger, press criticism, and gentle persuasion from the prime\nminister. Eventually the flag at Buckingham Palace was flown at half-mast, and the queen\nappeared on television to console her subjects.2 In effect the monarch gave in to public\ndemands to acknowledge Diana. Who then was sovereign?\n* I wish to thank Joanna Lewis, Andrzej Olechnowicz, Miles Taylor, and Philip Williamson for\ntheir helpful comments on this review.\n1 Julie Burchill used the phrase in the Modern Review in 1992.

This shift was spurred by wider intellectual developments. Under the impact of\nThatcherism, historians on the left began to reassess the reasons for the halted march of\nlabour, and turned their attention to the institutions and ideologies that they thought had\nimpeded the modernization of Britain. In particular, the idea of the \u2018 invention of tradition\u2019,\npopularized by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, criticized the pieties of popular\nnational history, and revealed how the notion of a stable and consensual national tradition\nwas largely mythical.3 The monarchy, it was suggested, was a central contributing factor to\nthe hierarchical, deferential, and nostalgic character of British political and social life. The\nother area of interest pursued the other side of this question.What would the modernization\nof Britain look like, and had there been missed opportunities in the past? The 1990s\nwitnessed a rebirth of interest in the constitution, and some consideration of where mon-\narchy fitted in. The \u2018problems\u2019 of the royal family have made the word \u2018republicanism\u2019\nmore widely known, even if only a minority has thoroughly embraced it. The most avid\nreformers generally consider that republicanism is an essential feature of any truly modern\nstate.4 What they mean by republicanism, however, is rarely explored satisfactorily. In\nparticular, these popular political writings are rarely aligned with work on republicanism in\nearly modern history, which has been of growing significance ever since the publication of\nJ. G. A. Pocock\u2019s Machiavellian moment in 1975. This review examines some of the recent\nworks on monarchy and anti-monarchy in order to reassess these problems, focusing on the\nperiod in which the monarchy supposedly became modern.\nI\nThe spectre of Bagehot haunts the historiography of the monarchy. While recent work has\nshown that the arguments of the English constitution were fairly commonplace when the book\nwas published in 1867, they have nevertheless structured the historical and constitutional\napproach to themonarchy.5This is ironic, since Bagehot\u2019s central interest was the \u2018efficient \u2019\nworking of government rather than the \u2018dignified\u2019 aspects of the constitution. He intended\n3 Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., The invention of tradition (Cambridge, 1983) ; TomNairn,\nThe enchanted glass : Britain and its monarchy (London, 1988). These writings may be located within the\nwider historiography of patriotism.

For a defence of themodern constitutional\nmonarchy see Vernon Bogdanor, The monarchy and the constitution (Oxford, 1995), and from a more\nhistorical point of view, John Cannon, \u2018The survival of the British monarchy\u2019, Transactions of the Royal\nHistorical Society, 5th ser., 36 (1986), pp. 143\u201364.\n5 RichardWilliams,The contentious crown: public discussion of the British monarchy in the reign of Queen Victoria\n(Aldershot, 1997), pp. 120, 244; Miles Taylor, \u2018 Introduction\u2019 to Walter Bagehot, The English constitution\n(Oxford, 2001), p. xxi ; Paul Smith, \u2018 Introduction\u2019 to the same work (Cambridge, 2001), p. xiv. The\nimpact of Bagehot is evident in Peter Hennessy,The hidden wiring : unearthing the British constitution (London,\n1995) ; Bogdanor, The monarchy and the constitution ; Brian Harrison, The transformation of British politics\n(Oxford, 1996), chs. 1, 12.\n168 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nto banish the old theory of a mixed and balanced constitution by revealing how the state\nreally worked, concentrating on how cabinet government was chosen by the House of\nCommons, which acted as an electoral college. The emergence of this system had rendered\nmost of the monarch\u2019s formal prerogatives obsolete. Even the powers to dissolve parliament\nand to create peers were essentially held by the prime minister. Bagehot did formalize the\nfamous trinity of royal \u2018 rights \u2019 to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn, but these are\nnotable for how little actual power they gave the monarch. He therefore concluded that \u2018a\nRepublic has insinuated itself beneath the folds of a Monarchy\u2019.6 Most twentieth-century\ncommentators agree that Bagehot either underestimated the monarch\u2019s powers or that he\nwas being prescriptive about them. Victoria\u2019s ministers in the 1860s would not have rec-\nognized his account as fact, nor did Victoria herself, who regarded him as a radical in any\ncase.\nBagehot\u2019s views about ceremony have been most influential, even if again he was rec-\nommending rather than describing a state of affairs.7 His argument rested on an evol-\nutionary psychology that drew a sharp distinction between the majority who were governed\nby their passions, and the minority who possessed reason. He thought that the \u2018masses \u2019 of\nEngland had remained intellectually stunted for centuries, and that he lived in \u2018a community\nin which primitive barbarism lay as a recognised basis to acquired civilisation\u2019.8 These\n\u2018barbarians \u2019 had little understanding of constitutional complexities, but they could be awed\nby the idea of a single individual wielding power. The purpose of monarchical theatre was to\nreinforce the idea that the monarch was the source of all political power. This was not,\nhowever, a timeless truth, but rather one fitted for England\u2019s current level of development.\nBagehot believed that even as late as the 1860s the uneducated \u2018masses \u2019 obeyed their queen\nbecause they thought her power divinely sanctioned. The \u2018 immense majority \u2019, he claimed,\nwould not say she ruled by parliamentary right, but \u2018will say she rules by \u2018\u2018God\u2019s grace\u2019\u2019 ;\nthey believe they have a mystic obligation to obey her\u2019.9 In other words, ideas of divine right\nlingered on into the Victorian period, and accounted for deference to \u2018 theatrical show\u2019.10\nThe striking point, then, is not that he gave a dignified and ceremonial function to the\nmonarchy, nor that he adhered to an evolutionary psychology which made it necessary to\nsway the ignorant by their imaginations. These two arguments lacked the necessary con-\nnecting tissue. After all, the belief that state ceremony has functional uses can apply to\nrepublics just as easily as to monarchies. The central point was that the English masses still\nheld to long-standing views about the awesome political and sacred power of the mon-\narchy, and accordingly they were not yet suited for the knowledge of elective government.\n6 Bagehot, English constitution, ed.

In the 1980s, both David Cannadine and Linda Colley argued\nthat \u2018 theatrical show\u2019 was central in explaining the emergence of a popular monarchy, even\nas its political powers declined. In slightly different ways, they saw the ritual of monarchy\nshaping a national identity based on tradition, hierarchy, and peculiarity, which in turn\napplied the brake to social and political modernization.12 This focus on ceremony owes\nsomething to the period in which these historians began working, one which saw Elizabeth\nII\u2019s silver jubilee in 1977 and the marriage of the prince ofWales and Lady Diana Spencer in\n1981. Such events seemed to reinforce a common idea, which Cannadine supports, that\n\u2018modern societies still need myth and ritual. A monarch and his family supply it. \u201913 More\nsubstantively, these histories reveal the emerging influence of cultural anthropology. In\nRituals of royalty, a collection of essays on monarchical ceremony in traditional societies,\nCannadine had the opportunity to develop these links further. While impressed by much of\nthe material on offer, he was critical about whether an overly structural approach to culture\ncould capture the origins of ceremony, and its changing forms andmeanings.He argued that\nhistorians should contextualize ceremony and be aware of the inevitably contested nature of\nits meanings.14 However, these points raise some questions about Cannadine\u2019s own work on\nthe monarchy. If the meanings of ceremony are not automatically given, it cannot be\nassumed that they shape a cultural consensus on the monarchy. It would be necessary to\nshowhow themeanings of ceremonywere produced, contested, and appropriated.15 Indeed,\nthe narrow focus on ritual itself needs to be challenged. It was a common view in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries that \u2018 show\u2019 was the best way of transfixing the\nimaginations of the \u2018masses \u2019, who were suffering a rationality deficit. Such assumptions are\nthemselves ripe for historical enquiry.\nNevertheless, thework ofCannadine andColley has had a significant impact on historians\nwriting in the 1990s. Cannadine argued that for most of the nineteenth century monarchical\nceremony was shambolic, and considered unimportant by a parliament and a populace\nfixated on retrenchment. The monarchy continued to wield significant political power,\n11 Bagehot, English constitution, ed. Taylor, p. 51.

This article, however, achieves its aims with more success than does Cannadine, \u2018The\ncontext \u2019.\n170 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nwhich militated against purely ceremonial functions. However, the aftermath of the\n\u2018republican moment \u2019 of the 1860s and 70s saw the lavish ritual of Victoria\u2019s jubilees in 1887\nand 1897, and her funeral in 1901.16Politicians began using and refining these occasions to try\nto mould national sentiment. William Kuhn has recently challenged some elements of this\nargument. He is opposed to historians who see late nineteenth-century rituals as \u2018 invented\ntraditions \u2019, and tries to establish their continuity with earlier periods.17 Focusing on some of\nthe architects of ceremonial, he reveals the depth of research, and the often tortuous\nnegotiations, involved in organizing jubilees, coronations, and funerals. While these events\nwere not completely invented, however, the effort of research that went into establishing\ncontinuity suggests that many of their details had long been forgotten. Also, it is clear that\nadvocates of increased ceremony did not agree about the meanings they should convey.\nBagehot andGladstone were unimpressed by overt imperial celebration, while Lord Esher\u2019s\napproach was less devotional than Gladstone\u2019s, and more socially select than Bagehot \u2019s.18\nThese disagreements about the meanings and functions of ceremony undermine Kuhn\u2019s\ndesire to see them as genuine rather than invented traditions. What also comes across\nstrongly is how key figures like Randall Davidson, and the duke of Norfolk, thought that the\nmonarchy should convey tradition and continuity in order to counter-balance an unwel-\ncome cultural and political modernity. There was widespread agreement amongst these\n\u2018 inventors \u2019 of tradition that ceremony encouraged social cohesion among the poorer classes,\nbut that the upper classes were impervious to it. This explains the growing importance\nattached to Victoria\u2019s processions through the southern and eastern districts of London.19\nWhat remains relatively absent from Kuhn\u2019s work, however, is a consideration of how\ndifferent sectors of the populace understood and reacted to ritual. It is a top-down approach\nthat does not answer whether royal ceremonies actually achieved their desired function.\nColley\u2019s writings onGeorge III adopt an approach that is similar toCannadine\u2019s, and they\nhave recently been supplemented by the work of Marilyn Morris. Colley and Morris both\nsuggest that as George III\u2019s political (and mental) powers declined in the 1780s, he was\nincreasingly identified as a neutral father figure to the nation. George himself can take\nsome credit for this. Whether promenading at Windsor, or strolling around Weymouth, he\nconsciously projected domestic and familial virtues. He was also impressed by the state\nfestivals of Jacques Louis David, and saw the naval thanksgiving of 1797 in this light. Some\npoliticians and sections of the press thought an increased ceremonial role for the monarchy\ndesirable.20 Colley and Morris also stress the popular contribution to royal celebration: for\n16 Cannadine, \u2018The context\u2019, pp. 120\u201332.

Theymight simply be an excuse for a day offwork, or a freemeal. They could also be\nused as a form of protest, as in Bristol when many trade groups refused to process in honour\nof George IV\u2019s coronation.22Nevertheless, bothColley andMorris conclude that George III\nenabled a transformation of monarchical popularity by serving as a focus of ritual splendour\nand a model of ordinary domesticity. This conclusion, however, does seem to evade the fact\nthat, despite their best efforts, George IV andWilliam IV did not enjoy the same popularity\nas their father.23\nThe arguments of Cannadine and Colley conflict in their chronologies. Both stress the\nimportance of ceremony in creating a popular monarchy, but the one locates this shift in\nthe late nineteenth century, while the other places it a hundred years earlier. Part of the\nexplanation may be that Cannadine overstates the shift towards ritual in the 1880s, as\nRichard Williams has recently suggested.24 Certainly Victoria did her best to avoid these\nduties, which she deemed both politically unnecessary and religiously undesirable.25 She also\nthought that royal marriages and funerals should be as private as possible. Again, it is true\nthat some critics denounced all ceremony as irrational and barbaric at worse, and expensive\nat best. Nevertheless, there is significant evidence of the desire for royal celebration from the\nvery beginning of Victoria\u2019s reign. The tory John Bull complained that the coronation was a\nchaotic affair, and the radical Figaro in London thought that there was a need to put on a\nproper display for the people. Interestingly, Williams shows that a significant proportion of\nthe London populace celebrated royal events spontaneously. During Victoria\u2019s coronation,\nshops and houses were decorated, and illuminations took place throughout the night. The\nStandard concluded that the \u2018grandeur of the spectacle is due solely to the people \u2019.26Williams\ntherefore argues that there were demands for inclusive royal celebrations from at least the\n1840s onwards, but that they were only really met from the 1880s. This popular enthusiasm\nfor the monarchy seems therefore to predate the \u2018 invention of tradition \u2019 rather than being a\nproduct of it. Furthermore, the use of ceremony did not automatically contribute to\nmonarchical popularity. The death of Princess Charlotte in 1817 provoked widespread\nmourning among many social and political groups, but the elaborate coronation of her\nfather in 1821 generated little public enthusiasm.27 In other words, there is no easy corre-\nlation between ceremony and popularity. The evidence points in toomany directions.What\nis lacking is a rich sense of how the populace responded to ceremonies, and the meanings it\nattributed to them. These could vary considerably. To agree with Bagehot that \u2018 theatrical\nshow\u2019 was essential to \u2018social control \u2019 is to make an unwarranted assumption which effaces\nthe complexity of the monarchy.\n21 Cited in Colley, Britons, p. 218. 22 Ibid., p. 227; Morris, British monarchy, p. 149.\n23 But see Prochaska, Royal bounty, ch. 2.\n24 Williams,Contentious crown, pp. 230\u20131 and ch. 8 generally.

Victoria may have ignored her ceremonial duties, but she thought her charitable\nwork important (unlike a number of politicians and journalists).28 Similarly both Albert, and\nthen the prince of Wales, toured the country, accepted positions as patrons, and generally\nmade their presence felt in civil society. Undoubtedly this helped to keep a favourable image\nof the monarchy in the public eye, but it could not monopolize what the institution meant to\npeople. Other recent works have accordingly examined the production, circulation, and\ntransformation of the meanings of monarchy. This has been most notable in writings on\nVictoria, particularly those by Adrienne Munich, Margaret Homans, and most recently\nJohn Plunkett.29 They have examined the ways in which the queen was encoded in various\ncultural forms from literature, painting, and sculpture to clothing, cartoons, and advertising.\nEven if the physical person of Victoria was rarely on display, her presence suffused culture in\nmediated forms. Perhaps the most striking point discussed by both Munich and Homans is\nwhether Victoria was in control of the representations of monarchy, or whether she was\nsubject to them. Homans points to the central paradox that Victoria was both powerful and\npowerless.30 This is obviously true of her constitutional role, but was also true of the way she\ncould both control and be controlled by cultural conventions. Gender is important here. In\nrelation to Albert she was superior in constitutional terms, but inferior according to gender\nnorms. Together they had to find ways of negotiating this paradox such that Victoria could\nbe both a ruler and a woman, while Albert could be manly but not politically threatening.31\nThroughout her reign, Victoria was an object of gendered and sexualized anxieties, evident\nfor example in the gossip concerning her relations with John Brown after Albert\u2019s death.32\nShe was even constrained by assumptions about what a monarch should wear, because she\noften refused to wear regal clothes and jewellery. A shepherd boy who took her for an\nordinary woman reportedly asked \u2018why don\u2019t she put on clothes so that folks would know\nher?\u2019, and Lord Roseberry once commented that the uniting symbol of the empire was a\nbonnet rather than a crown.33\nAs a woman and as a queen, Victoria was often subjected to governing conventions that\nshe opposed. She did, however, try to manipulate or resist many of them, and this may even\nhelp to account for the widespread support for her. In their years together, Victoria and\nAlbert consciously cultivated a \u2018bourgeois \u2019 style in their public appearances, and also\nadvertised this in photographs and paintings.34 They exploited such media to present\n28 Prochaska, Royal bounty, pp. 103\u20135, and chs. 3\u20134 generally.\n29 AdrienneMunich, Queen Victoria\u2019s secrets (New York, 1996) ; Margaret Homans, Royal representations :\nQueen Victoria and British culture, 1837\u20131876 (Chicago, 1998) ; Margaret Homans and Adrienne Munich,\neds., Remaking Queen Victoria (Cambridge, 1997) ; Plunkett, \u2018Queen Victoria\u2019.

It was suggested that her grief brought her closer to the people\u2019s hearts, and that\npersonal affection was the most significant reason for popular feeling towards her.36\nVictoria\u2019s presentation of herself as a perpetual widow also had the advantage of neutralizing\nsexualized criticisms, and reminding the public that Albert remained a royal presence even\nin death.37 Similarly, it has been suggested that her adherence to simple and unfashionable\nclothing aided her appeal to diverse social groups.38 In other words, Munich, Homans, and\nPlunkett have begun to open up the ways that the meanings of the queen were encoded, and\nhow this may have affected the public understanding of her. It seems likely that the illusion of\nintimacy created by the mass media, and underscored by knowledge of its philanthropy, did\nmore to generate and sustain interest in the monarchy than did state ceremonials, which by\ntheir nature were infrequent and impersonal.\nI I\nIn the rush to explore themonarchy\u2019s cultural authority, it can be tempting to forget about its\npolitical power. Everyone agrees that its power declined, but there is little consensus onwhen\nthis was accomplished. Peter Hennessey and Vernon Bogdanor, for example, have shown\nthat its formal residual powers, and its informal political influence, were felt in the twentieth\ncentury.39 These were obviously stronger in the preceding century, but they are difficult to\nquantify. In part this is because the inherently contested nature of the unwritten constitution\nmeant that there were always very different opinions about the legitimate powers of the\ninstitution. Victoria and Bagehot, for example, offered different visions of the constitution.\nBut it is also because of the whiggish view that the institution\u2019s significance dramatically\ndeclined over the nineteenth century. Even the recent Re-reading the constitution has less to say\non the subject than it might.40 Eighteenth-century historians, by contrast, have been more\ninterested in monarchical power, but their focus has usually been the mechanics of high\npolitics. Recently, however, work on political ideology and popular constitutionalism in the\nlate eighteenth century has begun to redress the balance, and it has important implications\nfor understanding nineteenth-century patterns.\n35 These images may not bear much relation to reality.

J. C. D. Clark has argued that there was a revival of support for a\nstrong monarchy during these revolutionary decades. While those firmly committed to\ntheological politics did advance such views, their wider significance should not be over-\nstated.41Recent work on JohnReeves, an ultra-loyalist, highlights the limits of constitutional\ndiscourse. In Thoughts on the English government (London, 1795), he launched a sustained attack\non mixed constitutionalism by arguing that even if the Commons and the Lords were\n\u2018 lopped off\u2019 legitimate government could go on. While he might have understood better\nthan many the inherent difficulty of combining absolute sovereignty with mixed con-\nstitutionalism, his contemporaries were nevertheless horrified. He found himself prosecuted\nfor sedition, and deserted by his political allies. Even in the 1790s, then, it waswidely accepted\nthat Britain possessed a mixed and balanced constitution in which king, Lords, and\nCommons governed together, and each prevented the corruption of the other.42 These\npieties, however, could be used to legitimate a wide range of positions. It is now widely\naccepted that George III, rather than harbouring absolutist ambitions, wanted to restore the\ncrown to its rightful constitutional position after decades of \u2018whig oligarchy \u2019. James J. Sack\nhas shown that he took little interest in the formal memoralization of Charles I, and\npersistently claimed to be governing constitutionally. He rightly thought that the ability to\nchoose and dismissministers in pursuit of the national good did not contravene either the Bill\nof Rights or the Act of Settlement.43 The main threat to constitutional balance, as he saw it,\nwas the whig attempt to force both men and measures on him. Once the 1784 election\nseemed to show that \u2018public opinion\u2019 supported him in this, he more or less settled with\nministers who held few ideological axes against monarchy, and continued to think (until he\nlost even that power) that his prerogatives were intact.\nThe whigs, of course, laid the blame for constitutional imbalance on the crown. In public\nthey blamedministers for leading the king astray, but in private they thought the king himself\nresponsible. Although economical reform was their proposed solution, Philip Harling has\nshown that Pitt and his followers were more successful in implementing this agenda. It is\na nice irony that ministers favoured because of their support for the crown did more to\nreduce its power than did those who attacked it.44 Nevertheless, the whigs persisted in their\n41 See J.

During the reform\ndebates some writers openly worried about this. One argued that an extension of the\nfranchise would create a \u2018pure democracy\u2019 in which themonarchy and aristocracy would be\nunable to counter-balance \u2018 the whole power of the state \u2019 that resided in the Commons.46\nThese fears misrepresented the purposes of the Act, which was intended to create an\nindependent Commons rather than a \u2018pure democracy\u2019. Nevertheless, reform changed the\npolitical landscape for both monarchs and governments, as William IV soon found out. In\n1834 he had no success in creating a \u2018broad-bottom\u2019 coalition, and theConservativeministry\nhe installed led the king\u2019s government to its first electoral defeat in 1835. Interestingly, as\nG. H. L. LeMay notes, Peel held to the traditional view that the king had the right to choose\nhis ownministers, and that even as aminority they should be given a fair trial in parliament.47\nSo while the king continued to believe that his powers remained unaltered in the mixed\nconstitution, and Peel professed the same, it was increasingly apparent that the new\nmechanics of the constitution subjected government to parliament and ultimately the\nelectorate.\nIt was this world of post-reform politics that Victoria inherited, and was to shape the\napproach that she and Albert took to politics. As Cannadine (amongst others) has suggested,\nthey did not try to create amodern constitutionalmonarchy, but rather to salvage asmuch as\nthey could for the institution from the reform settlement.48 By the early 1840s, they both saw\nparty as self-interested and anti-national, and thought that the best way to preserve the\nmonarchy\u2019s powers was to be above party but not outside politics. It has been argued that the\nmajor influences on Albert were his uncle Leopold, king of the Belgians, and their mutual\nadviser Baron Stockmar. They believed that monarchical prerogative and executive rule\nhad been dangerously eroded by the ReformAct, and hoped that Victoria and Albert would\nbe able to turn the sovereign into the \u2018 the permanent President of his Ministerial Coun-\ncil \u2026 a permanent Premier, who takes rank above the temporary head of the Cabinet \u2019.49\nAlbert took this seriously. He believed that the monarch should take a share in all\ngovernment decisions, recommend and veto appointments, and make dismissals when\nnecessary. When the press caught wind of this project, it was unimpressed. Readers were\nreminded of Albert\u2019s German (and supposedly absolutist) background: the London Pioneer, for\nexample, imperiously announced that the job of amonarch was \u2018 to sign our papers when we\nhave drawn them out ourselves \u2019.50Albert\u2019s dreams came to nothing, but more work needs to\nbe done on his conception ofmonarchy, and how it fits into wider constitutional beliefs of the\n1840s and 50s. After all, Disraeli\u2019s ideas about a \u2018 free monarchy\u2019 above faction were not\nunique. The Russophobe tory David Urquhart argued that the power of the legislative\nbranch had become excessive, and that it allowed the dominant faction to take control of the\nexecutive via the cabinet. He recommended reinvigorating the privy council, with a\n45 For the former position, see Clark, English society, 1660\u20131832, pp. 253\u20136, and for the latter Jonathan\nParry, The rise and fall of liberal government in Victorian Britain (New Haven, 1993), pp. 73\u20138.\n46 Cited in Clark, English society, 1660\u20131832, p. 552.\n47 G.

By the 1860s such ideas seemed out-\nof-touch, although some Conservatives occasionally tried to revive them.51\nAfter Albert\u2019s death, Victoria stuck to traditional views about her prerogatives, but much\nof this was concealed from the public. As Homans has shown, Victoria\u2019s Leaves from the journal\nof our life in the highlands lacked many leaves concerning political affairs.52 In terms of the day-\nto-day business of government, she expected not just to be informed, but to be debated with,\nto express an opinion, and even to reject advice. She hated being kept in the dark, and\ndisliked Palmerston for just that. She expected some control over cabinet appointments, and\noften worried about her closet being stormed. In 1880 she desperately tried to persuade\nHartington orGranville to become primeminister : anything to keepGladstone out. She also\nmaintained the prerogative of dissolving parliament, and threatened to disrupt Gladstone\u2019s\nhome rule bills by this expedient. Indeed,Michael Bentley has recently argued that from the\n1870s Victoria held firm political views, and hoped that ministers like Disraeli and Salisbury\nwould put them into effect.53 There are also suggestions that she hoped the Conservatives\nwould reinvigorate her political role. She preferred Disraeli\u2019s 1867 reform proposals to their\nearlier liberal incarnation because they reached down to a class \u2018who were infinitely more\nloyal than those just above them\u2019.54 Perhaps a \u2018 tory democracy \u2019 might even enable an\nincrease of prerogative? Victoria only seemed politically ineffectual to the public because of\nthe men around her. Advisers like Ponsonby insisted that her interference would damage\nthe monarchy, while politicians like Gladstone concealed her obstructionism for the same\nreason.55 In high politics, the queen may not have seemed as irrelevant as she did to the\npublic, and it would be useful to know more about how the culture of this elite world dealt\nwith her, and even protected her from herself.\nTo take a broader focus, it remained the case that the inner workings of the constitution\nwere not widely known throughout the \u2018 long\u2019 nineteenth century. This fact could be\nexploited by commentators in a fashion similar to Bagehot.Onewriter suggested in 1792 that\nit was important to speak highly of royalty to the lowest classes because \u2018 to talk to them of the\nconstitution is vain: they can only respect the constitution in its true representative and\nvisible emblem, theKing\u2019s person\u2019.56This again raises the paradox that concerned Bagehot :\nwhom did the public think actually governed? The notion that the monarchy had extensive\npowers waswoven into themental lives ofmany ordinary people at the turn of the nineteenth\ncentury. Steve Poole and John Barrell have both shown how common was the belief in the\npower of the monarch, over and above that of the ministry.57 Millenarians, for example,\nadvised the prince regent to heed scripture and act for the good of his people, and it seems\nlikely that religious beliefs about the centrality of the monarch remained common. Most\nstrikingly, Poole highlights the importance of petitioning the throne, a constitutional\nprivilege enshrined in the Bill of Rights. As late as 1854 Victoria was dealing with 800\npersonal petitions and begging letters a year.58 In the early nineteenth century, petitioners\n51 Ibid., pp. 120, 128\u201333; Miles Taylor, \u2018The old radicalism and the new: David Urquhart and the\npolitics of opposition, 1832\u20131867\u2019, in Eugenio F.

Poole argues that would-be regicides such as Margaret Nicholson, John Frith, and\nDennis Collins were usually subjects who resorted to desperate measures only because the\nking had not responded to their petitions.59 In other words, petitioners believed that the king\nhimself could and would do something for them.\nPetitioning was not restricted to those with private grievances. Reformers used mass\npetitions from the 1770s to draw attention to political and religious grievances, despite this\nbeing explicitly ruled out by the statute permitting petitioning.60 They usually did this after\nunsuccessfully petitioning parliament. As Morris, Poole, and Barrell show, during the 1790s\nreformers often argued that parliament was dominated by \u2018evil \u2019 ministers who had usurped\nthe powers of the crown. Reform societies saw lively debate about whether the cause of\ncorruptionwas the crown or theministry. Although scepticismwas often expressed about the\nutility of petitioning the crown, there remained a feeling that if the king really knew the\nsufferings of his people he would immediately dismiss his ministers. One handbill suggested\nthat the people would happily accept a patriot king as long as theywere not oppressed. And if\nthey were, reformers like Daniel Isaac Eaton and John Gale Jones warned the king that the\ncontract between crown and people could be dissolved.61 After 1815 there was an increasing\nbelief that petitioning parliament was pointless, and so reformers again turned to the crown.\nThe government did its best to close down this constitutional loophole, telling petitioners\nthat any necessary action would be taken by ministers. This only prompted cries that\nparliament was removing another right from the people. Only after his rejection of petitions,\nand his endorsement of the violent suppression of the St Peter\u2019s Field meeting (\u2018Peterloo\u2019) in\n1819, was the prince regent denounced as a \u2018sham father \u2019 and a tyrant.62Victoria\u2019s accession\nwas also exploited by reformers, with the LondonWorkingMen\u2019s Association addressing the\nqueen, urging her to instruct her ministers to prepare a bill for universal suffrage, and to\nignore the temptations of pomp and splendour. In 1848 there were calls for the queen to\ndismiss her ministers and call an election under the terms of the charter.63 Interestingly, the\nNorthern Star argued that the whigs and tories had together undermined a virtuous queen by\npassing unpopular measures which the \u2018 ignorant and undiscriminating \u2019 then blamed her\nfor.64 Even reformers suggested that, for the \u2018masses \u2019, the queen really governed.\nThese lines of thought ascribed considerable power to the monarch. No doubt these\narguments were often used more for rhetorical effect than from substantial conviction.\nNevertheless, they highlight ambivalence about whether governing power lay with the\nmonarch or with parliament. One pamphleteer had commented on this in 1803 while\ncomplaining about the extent of petitioning. It was not in the king\u2019s limited power, he\nargued, to relieve large numbers of people, despite the \u2018 ignorant and misguided\u2019 who\nthought that their welfare and happiness \u2018depend solely on the sovereign\u2019.65 Poole argues\nthat despite the attempt of government to assert its indistinguishability from the crown,\n59 Ibid., pp. 69, 90\u20131, 169\u201370.\n60 Peter Fraser, \u2018Public petitioning and parliament before 1832\u2019, History, 46 (1961), pp. 200\u20131.

Victoria\nand Albert may have wanted to take a larger role in politics, but the aims of radicals hardly\nfeatured on their agenda. The best way they could claim to care for their ordinary subjects\nwas through charitable activity and by promoting a \u2018welfare monarchy\u2019. But the fact that\neven radicals had difficulty in expelling the monarchy from their constitutional imaginings\nsuggests how tenacious its grip was.\nI I I\nWhat then of critics of monarchy? Recent works by Antony Taylor and Frank Prochaska \u2013\nas well as essays on Republicanism in Victorian society \u2013 have tried to reassess this old chestnut.\nTaylor, in particular, argues that rather than attending to \u2018cerebral republicanism\u2019, his-\ntorians should focus on the much wider stream of \u2018anti-monarchy\u2019.67 This approach should\nbe adopted with caution, however, because such sentiments often lambasted particular\nmembers of the monarchy for failing to live up to shared public values, and hardly equate\nwith opposition to the institution of monarchy. Nevertheless, there are stock themes that\nhave been used to criticize the royal family for over 200 years. The issue of the \u2018 foreignness \u2019\nof the royal family was a common complaint, and arose because of fears that national foreign\npolicy was being undermined by the intimate relations between British and European\nroyals.68 Aside from this, attacks on the royal family can almost be reduced to two words :\nmorality and money. These sentiments formed a basic tool-kit for anyone wishing to\ngenerate popular hostility to the royal family, and even pure republicans found it necessary\nto draw upon them.\nIn a period when evangelical values defined public life, the moral failings of the royal\nfamily proved too choice a plum to ignore. George III rejected the sexual dalliances of his\npredecessors in favour of sobriety and domesticity, but the private virtues of the father were\ncontrasted with the public vices of the sons. Even the \u2018right-wing \u2019 press complained that the\ngambling and adultery of the princes damaged respect for the throne.69 Victoria built up\nmoral capital with Albert, but blew some of it with John Brown.Once again, however, it was\nthe prince of Wales who was the real fly in the ointment. Although many conceded that he\nwas a personable chap, his gambling, adultery, and hunting hardly chimed with the\nbourgeois style of his father, and raised fears that the heir to the throne was another \u2018filthy\n66 Ibid., p. 201.

When the president of the United States seemed to\nrequire a mere \u00a35,000 a year, the grants given to Victoria, and then Albert, and then their\nchildren, seemed excessive.71 This argument proved particularly fruitful during the queen\u2019s\nseemingly endless retirement from public duties, and prompted fears that she was hoarding\nwealth. The notorious pamphlet, What does she do with it ? (1871), asked a puzzling, even\nworrying, question. In both cases these lines of attack could have been remedied without\ndamage to the institution. All that was required was that the royal family showed a will-\ningness to follow the public values of moral probity and financial prudence. In the former\ncase, Victoria and Albert could not be wholly responsible for the behaviour of their eldest\nson. As for money, the royal family often complained that their critics deliberately ignored\nthe range of public activities that they were engaged in.72 Also, Victoria insisted that her\nwealth was limited compared to the landed aristocracy who had \u2018no status or court to\nmaintain\u2019.73 This was perhaps an unfortunate comparison. It was the belief that the\nmonarchy was part of the wider problems of aristocratic vice and \u2018old corruption\u2019 that\nprompted these criticisms in the first place. It is interesting to speculate what would have\nhappened if the monarchy had more explicitly rejected aristocratic culture. No doubt it\nwould have been a popular move, which suggests that these criticisms were directed more at\nthe behaviour of individuals rather than at the failings of the institution. In fact high-minded\nrepublicans at the time made exactly this point, arguing that opposition to the monarchy\nmust have sound intellectual foundations.74\nIn a celebrated remark, John Adams once commented that \u2018There is not a more unin-\ntelligible word in the English language than republicanism. \u2019 \u2018 It may signify any thing, every\nthing, or nothing. \u201975 There is more to this claim than meets the eye, because eighteenth-\ncentury definitions of the word were rather broader than those of the late twentieth century.\nThe res publica or \u2018commonwealth \u2019 could mean little more than governing according to the\npublic interest. It is the narrower definition that has received sustained attention. A republic\nwas defined by the participation of the citizenry in government, which preserved their \u2018 free\nstate \u2019 from sliding into tyranny. Interestingly, in a recent discussion of this tradition,Quentin\nSkinner has preferred to label it a \u2018neo-Roman\u2019 theory of free states, rather than repub-\nlicanism as such. Adherence to this view could, but need not, entail the rejection of a\nhereditary prince.76The key element was that laws were enacted with the consent of citizens\nvia a representative body. For some civil war writers, such asMilton, the true republic could\nonly exist once the monarchy and the House of Lords had been destroyed. Others, such as\n70 Williams, Contentious crown, p. 34; Taylor, \u2018Down with the crown \u2019, pp. 113\u201314. The prince ofWales did\ncultivate a more accessible and human style than his mother.

A further set of writers argued that hereditary monarchy was tolerable as long as\nthere were safeguards against arbitrary power. So while \u2018republicanism\u2019 designated a self-\ngoverning community, it was potentially consistent with a hereditary prince.77\nThis republican compromise with monarchy was central to whig argument in the\neighteenth century, as the work of Caroline Robbins and J. G. A. Pocock showed some\ndecades ago.78 Maintaining a free state required shoring up the independence of the\nCommons from the insidious influence of the executive. While it was hoped that the \u2018virtue\u2019\nof representatives would be enough, a resort to various mechanisms such as shorter par-\nliaments and rotation of office might be necessary to prevent corruption. Until the final\ndecades of the century, however, few thinkers thought the removal of the monarchy\nnecessary or desirable. As Bridget Hill shows, even the circle of republican admirers sur-\nrounding Thomas Hollis and Catherine Macaulay in the 1760s and 70s were speculative\nrather than practical republicans, at least in the case of large states. They could look back and\nadmire the events of the seventeenth century, but remained committed to the broad shape of\nthe mixed constitution in their own time.79 By the 1790s, however, newer forms of repub-\nlicanism were entering the scene. As Richard Whatmore has recently shown, until this\nperiod few people thought real republicanism was possible in large commercial states.80 In\nBritain, Thomas Paine was an exception.81 In Common sense he argued that the ideal of self-\ngovernment through representation could not be achieved with a monarchy because it\nwould always try to overawe the Commons. InRights of man, the argument developed into an\nassault on the aristocratic social order which impeded true republicanism. Rather than\nprefiguring the welfare state, Paine\u2019s proposals attacked the mixed constitution and argued\nthat a more equal and unified nation would promote wise government, commerce, and\ninternational peace.82 Whatmore comments that \u2018 the modern republic was more powerful\nthan amixed state, because it combined the unified authority of absolute monarchy with the\ncivic commitment of an ancient republic \u2019.83 What is striking, however, is that the monarchy\nitself was not really the issue. Sieye`s also defended the \u2018modern republic \u2019, but he could not\nunderstand Paine\u2019s opposition tomonarchy, because a system of representative government\nwas quite compatible with a monarch as its chief magistrate. In other words the invention of\nthe \u2018modern republic \u2019 in the late eighteenth century was primarily about creating unitary\nsovereignty and representative government rather than abolition of the monarchy.84\n77 Ibid., pp. 36\u201357.

Even a supporter of universal male suffrage such\nas John Cartwright was careful to state his support for king, Lords, and Commons, and the\nneed to reform the \u2018old edifice\u2019 rather than destroy it.85 These reformers generally thought\nthat a major reform of the \u2018democratic \u2019 part of the constitution would be sufficient, and that\na king was tolerable in such circumstances. Indeed, as Prochaskamakes clear inThe republic of\nBritain, while the language of the republic became more common in the nineteenth century,\neven the definitions offered by its supporters were hardly cutting edge. ForRichardCarlile, a\nrepublic was any political system that consulted the public interest, and need not entail the\nabolition of the monarchy. Similarly for William Sherwin, a republican was anyone who\npromoted the public welfare, and might include \u2018kings, emperors, princes, dukes, earls,\nbarons, commoners \u2019.86 Henry Hetherington\u2019s Republican of the early 1830s was more clear-\ncut. It demanded the \u2018Establishment of [a] Republic viz. Democracy by Representatives\nelected by Universal Suffrage \u2019. It also wanted the extinction of all hereditary offices, titles,\nand distinctions and the abolition of primogeniture.87 By making the Commons a demo-\ncratic assembly it was ultimately thought possible tomarginalize the political influence of the\naristocracy, and then begin to dismantle their social order. In other words some radicals, at\nleast, pursued the goals of Paine but disguised their arguments in the old language of the\nmixed constitution. The fact that the land and the Lords often dominated political argument\nsuggests that some radicals and liberals were trying to introduce the essentials of Paine in a\nconstitutionalist idiom. It follows that despite the occasional rhetoric, the monarchy was not\na focal issue.\nThe recent debates about the nature ofmid-nineteenth-century radicalism exemplify this.\nSome historians argue that continental ideas were influential, while others insist that rad-\nicalism remained tied to a whiggish framework.88 Extreme figures such as George Harding,\nErnest Jones, George Julian Harney, and William Linton did take some interest in conti-\nnental republicanism, nationalism, and socialism, but they cannot be considered wholesale\nconverts. The wider radical movement was relatively unimpressed. The Chartists who\nproposed \u2018social republicanism\u2019 did not adopt socialist class analysis, and usually remained\nfocused on the question of land.Only a few proposed holding land as common property, and\nvirtually no one advocated state planning of production. It seems that the \u2018social \u2019 elements in\nsuch discourse were primarily developments of indigenous intellectual traditions.89 The key\nproblem remained the aristocracy. Linton, for example, disliked the pageantry of monarchy\nbut thought that the \u2018real royalty, is perhaps in the Lords and Commons\u2019. Harney thought\nEngland was a republic in the sense of being governed by more than one person, but was a\n\u2018 sham\u2019 because power was not lodged in the people.90 In other words a real republic was\nabout popular representation, and discussion usually focused on how this should fit into\nthe inherited constitution. While in principle hereditary monarchy may have been disliked,\nit rarely took centre-stage in the analysis.\n85 F. D.

Its identification with republicanism was mainly opportunist, ex-\nploiting popular frustration at Victoria\u2019s absence, and her heir\u2019s immorality, as well as the\ninterest in the new French republic. At its peak the republican clubs were mainly located\nin the west midlands and the north-east, but their total membership has been estimated\nat little more than 6,000.91 From the mid-1870s the movement rapidly declined. The issue\nof the monarchy was not even the prime concern of these republicans. All those involved,\nfrom working men to intellectuals, could agree that the civil list was excessive, and that\na royal family was probably inappropriate to a modern society, but their real concern\nwas the creation of a democratic republic in which the sovereign people elected depu-\nties.92 A republican conference in Birmingham in 1873 focused on local government, land\nreform, and religious issues, but barely mentioned the monarchy. It passed a resolution\nto abolish the House of Lords but not the monarchy. Core members of the movement\nwere usually ex-Chartists, and differences that emerged were usually over the social\nnature of this republic. Bradlaugh, for example, was criticized because, while he opposed\nthe monopoly on land, he did not attack the financial monopoly.93 The monarchy might\nbe emblematic of the problems republicans raised, but it was not easily argued that it\nwas the source.\nAs Prochaska shows, one common response to the republican movement was to suggest\nthat its arguments were misguided. For the Liberal MP, Henry Labouchere, Britain was a\nrepublicwith a hereditary president, and for the positivist writer, FredericHarrison, it was an\naristocratic republic with democratic machinery and a hereditary \u2018grand master of cer-\nemonies \u2019.94 Many agreed that a self-governing republic had been achieved without massive\nchanges to the unwritten constitution. For most reforming liberals the pressing challenges\nwere the land and the Lords, rather than the monarchy. It was only extreme democratic\nrepublicans who disagreed. The Social Democratic Federation, for example, wanted to\nplace \u2018 supreme political power in the hands of the mass of the people \u2019.95 They opposed all\naspects of political life which were not based on the elective principle, and they expected\nrepresentatives to be tied closely to the people. There is evidence of a continuation of such\nthemes in the early Labour party, but there was also the emergence of a Fabian stream that\nrejected this analysis. Democracy for them was about parliamentary management of the\npeople\u2019s affairs rather than popular control over representatives.

Even labour leaders who disliked the monarchy, such as Keir\nHardie, thought social reform the priority. While the Labour party was not as indifferent to\nconstitutional matters as has sometimes been claimed, its prime concerns were the House of\nLords and home rule.97Themonarchy seemed relatively popular and politically neutral, and\nthere was little to be gained in attacking it. Not everyone agreed that Britain was a \u2018crowned\nrepublic \u2019, and the secret influence of the monarchy did not vanish, but with the gradual\neclipse of an older democratic republicanism there were fewer voices who could muster the\nintellectual tools to oppose it.\nI V\nIn spite of the golden jubilee of Elizabeth II, the lustre of themonarchy seems to have faded a\nlittle. But, if anything, the public appetite for bulky biographies and glossy guides seems to\nhave increased. Part of the appeal is the simple pleasure of a \u2018good story \u2019, but it also stems\nfrom a desire to peal back the stoical fac\u00b8ade, and to see \u2018what they are really like\u2019.98This is not\nmerely prurience, but rather a fascination with how ordinary humans cope with being\n\u2018royal \u2019, with all the constraints, privileges, and expectations it involves. It is hardly surprising\nthat the public reacts by turns with empathy, schadenfreude, and anger. By contrast, academic\nhistorians betray a sort of puzzled fascination with this (while being aware of the potentially\nlucrative nature of the subject). Their questions have often concentrated on how the\nmonarchy has survived into themodern period, and their answers usually revolve around its\nwithdrawal from the political sphere, and its subsequent transformation into a symbolic\nrepresentative of the nation. In considering the latter, it used to be tempting to use\npsychological or sociological models, but they now appear rather crude and elitist. A more\nappealing approach tries to uncover what the monarchy has meant to the public at different\ntimes, and what the mechanisms for this were. With varying degrees of success, the royal\nfamily has been able to draw upon themassmedia to shape public understandings, but at the\nsame time it has been acutely aware that it must appear to represent national values. This is a\ncomplex reciprocal process that historians are unlikely to recover fully. Nevertheless, paying\nattention to the evolution of royal images and narratives, and how they relate to shifting\npublic values,may be the best way to account for both the sense of closeness between subjects\nand sovereign, but also the moments of defiance and outrage.\nBut are such histories enough? Many of the works discussed in this review have been\nwritten, in part, as contributions to the current debate on the future of the monarchy. This is\namore obviously political question.While themonarchy\u2019s political powers did decline in the\n96 Ibid., p. 86; Logie Barrow and Ian Bullock, Democratic ideas and the British labour movement, 1880\u20131914\n(Cambridge, 1996), pp. 176\u20137 and chs. 1\u20132 generally.

Victoria wielded patronage and influence,\nand it would be useful to knowmore about how this affected the culture of high politics. Did\nmost politicians think that she was a political irrelevance? More broadly, we need to under-\nstand popular views of royal power. Is it true that the public had abandoned any beliefs\nabout the political role of the monarch by the early twentieth century?99 Conversely, some\nhistorians have argued that Britain\u2019s republican tradition needs reclaiming. This review has\nsuggested that while there were traditions of \u2018anti-monarchical \u2019 sentiment, they should be\nseen as a way of urging individuals to adhere to the public values that they were supposed to\nrepresent. As for pure republicans, they never formed a large group. Indeed, on closer\ninspection, it seems that their vision of a republic was more concerned with the nature of\nrepresentation, and the power of the aristocracy, rather than with the monarchy. This also\nsuggests an important concluding point. It is evident that the debate about the monarchy in\nthe 1990s was really a debate about the state. This can sometimes be overlooked in works\nwhich see the monarchy as increasingly a constituent of national identity. The cultural\nhistory of \u2018 the nation\u2019 is inevitably wrapped up with the political history of \u2018 the state \u2019, even if\nthe relationship between the two concepts has evolved over the last two centuries or so.100To\nfocus on the monarchy, then, without considering the state is to miss the real point.\nMoreover, as the inventors of the \u2018modern republic \u2019 noted long ago, the modernization of\nthe state need not entail the abolition of the monarchy, but it should include the for-\nmalization of the powers of all political institutions. Understanding why this has not yet\nhappened is in part a story about the monarchy, but it cannot be detached from wider\nhistories of the state.\n99 An unpublished survey in 1966 found that a majority thought that the queen would and should\nprevail in a difference of opinion with the prime minister.
