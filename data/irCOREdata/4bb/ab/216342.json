Natural capital provides basic\/fundamental life-support functions, is a necessary \ninput into production due to the first law of thermodynamics and is often unique in that its \ndestruction is irreversible. The notorious prevalence of risk, uncertainty and ignorance makes it \ndifficult, however, to state which parts of natural capital should be preserved. Some forms of \nnatural capital are more likely to be substitutable than others. A good case can be made for \npreventing large-scale biodiversity loss, protecting the ozone layer, restricting emissions that \ncause global warming, limiting the accumulation of toxic pollutants and for restricting over-\nharvesting and soil erosion. \nAnother difficult question is how, to what extent and for how large costs certain forms of natural \ncapital should be preserved. Both the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 and the concept of \u2018safe minimum \nstandards\u2019 are rather elusive, especially on the question of costs. Policy measures are discussed \nthat allegedly preserve natural capital at low, or even negative, costs: the abolishment of \nenvironmentally and economically harmful subsidies, the substitution of market-based for \ncommand-and-control instruments, the substitution of ecotaxes for labor and capital income \ntaxes and the so-called \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis that tighter environmental regulation will increase \nfirms\u2019 productivity. It is argued, however, that while there is some scope for policies that are \ngood for the environment and for economic development at the same time, the relationship \nbetween the environment and the economy is likely to remain one of a fundamental trade-off. \nResolving this trade-off is beyond scientific reach and should be left to democratic decision \nmaking. What science can do, is to help basing democratic decisions on rational grounds. \n3 \n1. INTRODUCTION \nIf society is committed to sustainable development, or sustainability for short, should it preserve \nany natural capital? The answer to this apparently \u2018heretic\u2019 question is not as easy and intuitive as \nmany environmentalists think. Indeed, the now dominant view among neoclassical economists is \nthe perfect substitutability paradigm: What matters for future generations is only the aggregate \ntotal capital they inherit \u2014 be it human-made, natural or any other form of capital (Hartwick \n1990, Solow 1993). According to this view which comes under the name of \u2018weak \nsustainability\u2019, the depletion of natural capital does not matter for future generations as long as \nenough other forms of capital are built up instead. \nI define sustainability here as economic development that leaves future generations at least as \nwell off as the current generation. Obviously such a definition is anthropocentric in that it denies \nany intrinsic relevance of nature for questions of sustainability. Nature has value if and only if \nhumans value nature. Note, however, that humans might value nature for whatever reasons and \nnot merely because it contributes to the production of consumption goods or directly produces \nutility through environmental amenities. Humans might very well value nature as such in \nattributing \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value to nature, but it is still humans who determine the value. \nWhat is natural capital? Capital is defined here broadly as a stock that provides current and \nfuture flows of service. Natural capital is then the totality of nature, i.e. resources, plants, species \nand ecosystems, that is capable of providing human beings with material and non-material flows \nof service. \nThis paper argues that to contest the perfect substitutability paradigm of weak sustainability \none first needs to explicate the distinctive features of natural capital. There are three aspects \u2014 \nbasic life-support function, necessity for production, irreversibility of destruction \u2014 that \ndistinguish natural from other forms of capital. Also, one must differentiate and move beyond \nthis abstract term \u2018natural capital\u2019: Some forms of natural capital are more likely to be \nsubstitutable than others. \nIf that was all, however, sustainability would be an easy task, the prescription simply being to \npreserve all those forms of natural capital that exhibit distinct features and are not likely to be \nsubstitutable by other forms of capital. But the actual world we are living in is one of imperfect \ninformation where risk, uncertainty and ignorance abound and financial resources are scarce. The \nabsence of certainty and perfect information frustrates any attempt to give clear-cut answers on \nwhich forms of natural capital should be preserved. \n4 \nThe following three sections of this paper develop this argument. Section 2 starts out with \nhighlighting distinctive features of natural capital. Section 3 discusses the implications of the \nnotorious prevalence of risk, ignorance and uncertainty concerning the environment. Section 4 \nbrings the first two threads together and states which forms of natural capital are most likely and \nwhich are less likely in need of an explicit preservation policy. \nThe next question is how, to what extent and for how large costs should certain forms of \nnatural capital be preserved, given that finance is scarce. Section 5 discusses two famous policy \nprinciples, namely the precautionary principle and the concept of safe minimum standards that \nwere developed to deal with situations of uncertainty and ignorance. As it turns out, both \nprinciples are very elusive on whether and how much preservation should be undertaken if it is \ncostly to do so. Section 6 therefore discusses preservation when financial resources are scarce. It \nasks whether preservation of natural capital can be achieved at low, or even negative, economic \ncosts. It analyses the abolishment of wasteful subsidies, the substitution of market-based for \ncommand-and-control instruments, the substitution of ecotaxes for labor and capital income \ntaxes and the so-called \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis that tighter environmental regulation will increase \nfirms\u2019 productivity. It argues that although there is some scope for undertaking measures at \nminimal costs, the relationship between the environment and the economy is likely to remain one \nof a fundamental trade-off rather than a \u2018free lunch\u2019. A resolution of this trade-off is beyond \nscientific reach, however, and is rightly to remain in the political realm, because science cannot \ntell society how risk-averse it should be as regards the preservation of natural capital. The social \nand natural sciences can help in making the choices transparent and rational \u2014 but how much the \ncurrent generation is willing to sacrifice for preserving natural capital is ultimately a matter of \ndemocratic decision making. Section 7 concludes. \n5 \n2. DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF NATURAL CAPITAL \nWhat makes natural capital distinct from other forms of capital? There are three aspects that can \njustify such a distinction: \n \n\u2022 Natural capital provides very basic and fundamental life-support functions that no other form \nof capital can provide. It is multifunctional in a way and to an extent that is not shared by \nother forms of capital (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1992). Natural capital is the basis of all life, human \nand non-human: It is the world ecosystem that contains the economy, not the economy that \ncontains the world ecosystem (Daly and Townsend 1993, p. 3). Mankind can exist and indeed \nhas to a large extent existed in the past without major human-made or other forms of capital, \nbut it cannot live without some minimum level of natural capital. The outstanding value of \nnatural capital is not that we can use fossil fuel, e.g., but that nature enables the very existence \nof human life. Nature might cope with piece-meal destruction for a long time, but if a certain \nthreshold is exceeded, the whole system could break down. There are \u2018limits to meta-resource \ndepletion\u2019 (Ehrlich 1989). These life-support \u2018resources\u2019 really are non-substitutable and their \ndegradation would often lead to irreversible catastrophes. Their \u2018basicness\u2019 makes it difficult \nto estimate accurately or even approximately their specific value. In some sense, they are \nsimply priceless: their value to humans is infinite. \nExamples that come to one\u2019s mind are the ozone layer and the biogeochemical cycle of the \natmosphere. The same applies more generally to basic ecosystem functions. Costanza et al. \n(1997) recently have given a conservative estimate of the value of the world\u2019s ecosystems. \nThey suggest this value to lie in the range of US$ 16-54 trillion as a minimum estimate. For \ncomparison, global gross national product is about US$ 18 trillion per year, so the value of the \nworld\u2019s ecosystems is very large indeed. (Note that in Costanza et al.\u2019s (1997) estimates the \nvalues for specific items whose magnitude is likely to be infinite as for the global climate have \nbeen deliberately truncated to make them finite and to provide a lower bound estimate of the \nreal value.) \n \n\u2022 Natural capital is to some extent a necessary input for production. The first law of \nthermodynamics tells us that nothing can be produced without some resource input and that \nnothing can be destroyed. As long as the energy from solar influx is by and large not used, \nenergy and material become invariably transformed from low entropy to high entropy. \nRecycling and re-use can delay this entropic transformation, but it can neither stop nor reverse \n6 \nit according to the second law of thermodynamics. There is some minimum level of natural \ncapital that we need for resource input and for taking up the unwanted side-products of output \n(pollution and waste). The conjecture that we could live without any natural capital \ncontradicts fundamental physical laws. In contrast, it is possible in principle to live without \nany human-made capital such as factories, machineries, roads etc. \n \n\u2022 Some forms of natural capital are unique in that they cannot be rebuilt once they have been \ndestroyed. That is, destruction of some forms of natural capital is irreversible or quasi-\nirreversible. Some environmental assets are fundamentally non-substitutable which is in \ngeneral not the case for other forms of capital. Human-made capital can always be \nreconstructed if it has been destroyed. Reconstruction is costly, of course, and it may take \nsome time, but at least it is possible in principle. Admittedly, this is not true for unique \nhistorical buildings which provide non-material value, but certainly for human-made capital \nused in production. \nAn example for irreversible natural capital loss is the destruction of biodiversity: it is \nimpossible to bring an extinct species back to life. Examples for quasi-irreversibility are the \nozone layer destruction and global warming: Both the ozone layer and the climate may \n\u2018regenerate\u2019 to their former state if allowed to do so, but it takes \u2018too much time\u2019 (from a \nhuman perspective) to wait for the natural regeneration. The consumption of \u2018non-renewable\u2019 \nresources is another example of quasi-irreversibility. \n7 \n3. RISK, UNCERTAINTY AND IGNORANCE \nIf we are aware of the distinctive features of natural capital, why can\u2019t we simply preserve all \nthose forms of natural capital that provide basic life-support functions, are necessary for \nproduction and irreversibly lost after destruction? If we lived in a world of certainty and limitless \nfinancial resources, there would not be any problem. But unfortunately we are living in a world \nthat is plagued by ubiquitous risk, uncertainty and ignorance. Therefore we do not know for \ncertain which forms of natural capital we should preserve. Also, finance is scarce, an issue which \nis discussed in later sections. \n \nRisk \nRisk refers to a situation where the set of all possible states of the world, the probability \ndistribution over the set of possible states and the resulting payoffs can be objectively known. \nBuying a lottery ticket is a good example for engaging in a risky action, because the odds of \nwinning can be objectively known as can the costs of buying the ticket and the value of potential \nprizes \u2014 hence the expected gain or loss can be computed without any remaining doubt. \nIn order to cope with risk, economists have included so-called option values into their \ntraditional cost-benefit analyses. In the environmental context, option value is the expected value \nof refraining from an action that leads with some given probability to irreversible environmental \ndestruction in order to keep the option open of using the environmental resource in the future. \nOption value can thus be interpreted as a kind of risk premium: it lowers the net benefit of the \nconsidered action, it reflects an additional opportunity cost and the \u2018price\u2019 society is ready to pay \nin order to keep the option of future use of the environmental resource open. The more risk-\naverse society is, the higher will the option value be. In case of extreme risk aversion, the option \nvalue can be infinite and the action that could result in environmental destruction should not be \nundertaken whatever its likely other benefits. On the other hand, if society is risk-preferring, it \nwill be more inclined to take the action and risk the irreversible environmental destruction. \nNote that we are typically not confronted with a \u2018risky\u2019 situation when we are trying to judge \nthe validity of running down natural capital because in most cases we do not know either the \nprobability distribution of all possible states nor do we know the potential outcomes resulting \nfrom the different states of the world. What is worse: often we do not even know the complete \nset, that is, we are ignorant of the total number of possible states of the world. \n \nUncertainty \n8 \nUncertainty refers to a situation where the probability distribution over a set of possible states of \nthe world and the resulting payoffs cannot be known objectively, but agents have subjective \nbeliefs about the objective distribution and the payoffs. Those beliefs can be updated (and in \nmany cases improved) over time, i.e. they are not static as is the case in the context of risk, but \ndynamic. Agents can learn to improve their beliefs on the basis of Bayesian decision theory rules \n(Faucheux and Froger 1995). \nOption values can be used in a context of uncertainty as well, only that this time it is the \nsubjectively expected value that counts. Additionally, economists have included so-called quasi-\noption values into their traditional cost-benefit analyses. In the environmental context, quasi-\noption value is the value of delaying an irreversible environmental destruction in order to acquire \nimproved information and to make a better informed future decision. For quasi-option values to \nmake sense, we have to expect that either future information will tend to favor environmental \npreservation for given preferences or that the preference for environmental resources will \nincrease over time. Only then is there a positive value, otherwise there would be a cost in keeping \nthe environmental option open (Beltratti, Chichilnisky and Heal 1993, Chichilnisky and Heal \n1993). Note that quasi-option value, contrary to option value, does not depend on society being \nrisk-averse; even a risk-loving society can exhibit a positive quasi-option value for preserving an \nenvironmental resource. \nUncertainty comes rather close to our present state of knowledge about many rather novel and \ncomplex, but most pressing environmental problems such as global warming. We know \nsomething about the effects of dumping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we know something \nabout the climatic consequences, we can imagine different states of the world following and we \nhave some idea about the probability distribution over these different states of the world. Our \nknowledge about climate change is still rather poor, however. \n \nIgnorance \nIgnorance refers to a situation where we have no idea whatsoever about the set of possible states \nof the world, about the probability distribution over the set and about the resulting payoffs. A \nweaker definition would allow for subjective beliefs where those beliefs are largely arbitrary, \nhowever, and lack a sound foundation. \nIt seems fair to say that our knowledge about the extent and the likely consequences of large-\nscale biodiversity destruction resembles more a situation of ignorance than of uncertainty. \nEstimates from the United Nations\u2019 Environmental Program of the number of existing species \n9 \nvary between seven and twenty million (Schuh 1995) of which about 1.4 million are named by \nbiologists (Brown et al. 1994, p. 4). Our knowledge about most of the named species is only \nrudimentary (Norton 1986). Estimates of expected loss of species over the next 25 years vary \nbetween 2 and 25% (Schuh 1995) and we are arguably miles away from knowing anything about \nthe loss in value terms of this destruction of biodiversity. As Norton (1986, p. 203) rightly \nargues, \u2018it is an understatement to refer to this level of ignorance as mere \u2018uncertainty\u2019\u2019. We are \n\u2014 almost necessarily \u2014 so much ignorant of the complex interlinkages within ecosystems that \nwe cannot know the value of either single species or the whole of biodiversity to any reasonable \nextent of precision. \nClimate change is another example for ignorance. We have introduced it under the heading of \nuncertainty above, but IPCC (1996, p. 161) rightly claims that \u2018when dealing with many of the \neffects of climate change, ignorance is perhaps a more appropriate concept than uncertainty\u2019. The \nlesson is that often environmental problems have aspects of both uncertainty and ignorance. \nAlso, ignorance has in the past been quite common for environmental problems: DDT and \nCFCs were both thought to be benign for the environment before their detrimental effect was \ndiscovered. And ignorance is arguably a pretty good description of the quality of our knowledge \nabout the consequences of human activity on the state of the environment beyond the very \nimmediate future. \n10 \n4. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL CAPITAL \nThe combination of risk, uncertainty and ignorance with the distinctive characteristics of natural \ncapital (basic life-support functions, necessity for production, irreversibility of destruction) \nfrustrates any attempt to draw any general conclusions on which forms of natural capital should \nbe preserved. Some forms carry more of the distinctive features than others, some are more prone \nto uncertainty and ignorance than others. It is therefore necessary to go one step beyond this \nabstract notion \u2018natural capital\u2019 and to distinguish which forms are more and which forms are \nless in need for explicit preservation. \n \nBiodiversity and global environmental resources \nTake ecosystems and the biodiversity they exhibit first. It is a well established fact in ecology \nthat ecosystems are characterized by highly nonlinear, discontinuous and discrete changes in their \necological \u2018resilience\u2019, that is, in their ability to \u2018recover from and thus absorb\u2019 (Barbier, Burgess \nand Folke 1994, p. 17) external and internal shocks. The stability of ecosystems ultimately \ndepends on the extent of its resilience and not so much on the stability of individual components. \nThe complexity of ecosystems is still poorly understood and not easy to understand anyway. \n\u2018Ecosystems do not have single equilibria with functions controlled to remain near it. Rather, \ndestabilizing forces far from equilibria, multiple equilibria and the absence of equilibria define \nfunctionally different states\u2019 (Holling 1995, p. 49). Due to this fact, an ecosystem might be able \nto cope with piecemeal destruction for quite a long time, but it can break down unexpectedly fast \nafter some (often unknown) threshold has been transgressed (Perrings and Pearce 1994). In some \nsense, every small-scale destruction of an ecosystem increases the likelihood of unraveling the \nwhole ecosystem (Randall 1991, p. 65). While not undisputed (see Perrings, Folke and M\u00e4ler \n1992), there is a large body of evidence from ecological studies suggesting that \u2018resilience \nincreases with system complexity, and complexity can be measured by biological diversity. In \nthat way, the more diversity there is, the more resilience there is and hence the more sustainable \nthe system is.\u2019 (Pearce 1994, p. 148). Ceteris paribus, the more biodiversity there is, the bigger is \nthe opportunity set open for future generations (Perrings 1994). Hence, there is a good case for \npreventing biodiversity loss. \nThere is also, more generally, a good case for protecting the \u2018global environmental system\u2019 \n(Clark 1995, p. 146) such as the global climate and the ozone layer. Both are fundamental life-\nsupport resources whose destruction would endanger the welfare if not the existence of coming \ngenerations. While a certain rise in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide seems \n11 \ninevitable, precautionary action should be undertaken to prevent large and unpredictable changes \nin the global climate. Since we do not know exactly beyond which concentration these \ncatastrophic changes will occur we must make sure that our emissions stay well below the limit \nthat best available science suggests to be the critical level. \n \nAccumulating toxic pollutants \nA good case can also be made for not letting emissions, especially highly toxic and health-\ndamaging emissions, accumulate in the environment. The aim should be to not letting emissions \nexceed \u2018critical loads\u2019 after which the capacity of the receiving media to dissipate and diffuse \nemissions would be damaged. This prescription would rule out the use of highly toxic chemicals \nif they cannot be prevented from entering the environment. It would also rule out the use of \nnuclear power with its highly damaging by-products on all stages of the nuclear circle and its \naccumulating highly toxic nuclear waste radiating for tens of thousands of years. \n \nNatural resources \nOne might wonder why so little has been said about the necessity of resources for production. \nThe reason is that in a context of risk, uncertainty and ignorance it seems likely that the \ndistinctive features of natural capital are especially relevant when it comes to the global \nenvironmental system and accumulating toxic pollutants as opposed to the global resource \nsystem. Property rights over resources are often much better defined and the global \nenvironmental system, unlike the global resource system, lacks an \u2018automatic self-correcting \nfeedback loop\u2019 (Clark 1995, p. 146) and especially lacks a functioning price system. There are \ngood reasons to presume that the global resource system will be much better taken care of in \nsome way or other than the global environmental system. It is the waste absorbing function of the \nenvironment that is most under threat and least protected. That is not to say, that resource \navailability might never pose a problem, but the frequent falsification of alarms about immediate \nresource exhaustion presents a case in point (e.g. Meadows et al. 1972). The world economy has \nso far exhibited a most remarkable capability to overcome resource constraints via substitution \nand technical improvements. \n \nFood resources \nWhat about food resources? To feed more people there are two basic strategies. One is \nextensification: It is estimated that the amount of land usable for growing crops is three times \n12 \nlarger than current usage (Preston 1996, p. 96). Alternatively, land could be used more \nintensively. In Europe, for example, usage of cropland fell by one quarter and the total forested \narea grew by 30 percent in spite of increased food production (Preston 1996, p. 99). Table 1 \nshows the trend in per capita world food production alongside production in Africa and Asia. \n \n \nThe figures reveal that while food production has caught up with growing world population \nand has even increased in per capita terms in Asia and the world as a whole over the last thirty \nyears or so, it has dramatically declined in Africa. What this suggests is that the availability of \nfood is more a problem of intra-generational distribution than of inter-generational sustainability \nas such. However, where there are clear signs of over-harvesting, soil erosion and land \ndegradation a good case can be made to enforce \u2018sustainable\u2019 harvesting, that is harvesting within \nthe limits of natural regeneration, and to maintain soil fertility. The availability of food is most \nbasic to ensure non-decreasing future welfare and where there are clear signs that danger to food \nsecurity is imminent, conservatory steps should be undertaken. \nNature as such does not seem to impose limits on increasing food production enough to feed \nmany more people. Waggoner (1994, p. 1) in a Task Force Report for the American Council for \nAgricultural Science and Technology comes to the conclusion that \u2018the global totals of sun on \nland, CO2 in the air, fertilizer, and even water could produce far more food than ten billion \n[people] need\u2019 . For other cautiously optimistic views on the availability of food for a human \npopulation rising up to ten or twelve billion people see Ruttan (1991) and Bongaarts (1994). \n \nIn summary, a good case can be made \n\u2022 for conserving \u2018rather more than less\u2019 natural capital in the form of biodiversity, \n\u2022 for protecting the ozone layer and restricting emissions that cause global warming, \n\u2022 for limiting the accumulation of toxic pollutants and  \nTable 1. Index of per capita food production (1979-81 = 100). \n \n1964-66 1979-81 1982-84 1984-86 1992-94 \nWORLD 95 100 102 104 104 \nAFRICA 109 100 94 95 94 \nASIA 92 100 108 113 127 \nSource: WRI (1988-89, p. 272f.; 1996-97, p. 238f.) \n13 \n\u2022 for restricting over-harvesting and soil erosion. \nThe case is strengthened by the fact that examples abound where there are negative \ninterlinkages between environmental problems: Deforestation often worsens loss of topsoil and \nland degradation and contributes to global warming. Acid rain not only kills forests but also \ncontaminates freshwater sources. Ozone depletion contributes to global warming and some of the \nsubstitutes for CFCs have high global warming potentials. \nBut how to put these prescriptions into practical policy-making? Even if we knew exactly \nwhich forms of natural capital we should preserve, the question is still how much preservation \nshould there be and how much cost should be incurred for preservation? There exist two famous \npolicy principles, namely the precautionary principle and the concept of safe minimum standards. \nDo they give clear answers to what extent and at what costs the critical forms of natural capital \nshould be preserved? Note that the following arguments cannot, for reasons of space, discuss all \ncritical forms of natural capital. Discussion is limited to biodiversity protection and, albeit less \nso, to global warming. \n14 \n5. POLICY PRINCIPLES TO COPE WITH RISK, UNCERTAINTY AND IGNORANCE \n5.1 THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE \nThe most basic principle is the so-called \u2018precautionary principle\u2019. It has two important elements: \nFirst, preventive measures for environmental conservation should be undertaken before there are \ndefinite scientific results \u2018proving\u2019 that protection of the environment is necessary. The \nmotivation is to avoid regretting environmental inaction after unacceptable irreversible \nenvironmental destruction has already taken place. One good example is global warming. As \nenvironmentalists emphasize: It is better to be vaguely right in time than precisely right too late. \nSecond and related to the first point, the burden of proof should shift to those who believe that an \naction has only negligible detrimental consequences on the environment. That is, the new default \nposition should favor environmental preservation, whereas current practice still favors economic \nactivity over environmental preservation. The precautionary principle can thus be interpreted as \nan insurance scheme against uncertain future environmental catastrophes. \nThe precautionary principle was first integrated into official policy statements in the 1970s in \nformer Western Germany in the form of the so-called Vorsorgeprinzip (Boehmer-Christiansen \n1994). It soon found its way in virtually every official document on the environment and in \ncountless international environmental treaties (Cameron and Wade-Grey 1995). It should come \nas no great surprise that this seeming \u2018success\u2019 of the precautionary principle was largely due to \nthe fact that it does not provide any clear operationable guidelines or a rigorous analytical \nscheme. As Bodansky (1991) observes, the precautionary principle is not able to give a clear \nanswer on when it should be applied, that is, what are acceptable and unacceptable \nenvironmental dangers, at what costs it should be applied and what types of precautionary actions \nshould be undertaken. \n \n5.2 SAFE MINIMUM STANDARDS (SMS) \nAnother principle that seemingly takes better account of the question of preservation costs is the \nSafe Minimum Standard (SMS). Propositions to introduce SMS date back to Ciriacy-Wantrup \n(1952) and were originally reserved for issues of species preservation and biodiversity protection. \nRecently, however, the notion of SMS has been increasingly used for other environmental topics \nas well. IPCC (1996, p. 159), e.g., speaks of an \u2018affordable safe minimum standard\u2019 for reduction \nof greenhouse gases. \nSMS in the context of species preservation calls for granting a species some minimally viable \nstandard, as long as the economic costs of doing so are not \u2018unacceptably high\u2019. The reason for \n15 \nadopting SMS is that because of risk, uncertainty and ignorance the exact value of biodiversity \ncannot be measured. Hence, to avoid potentially high future costs, biodiversity should be \nconserved \u2014 to repeat: as long as the costs of doing so are not \u2018unacceptably high\u2019. \nThe concept of SMS has been officially embraced by UNEP\u2019s Global Biodiversity Program \n(Crowards 1996, p.16). The Endangered Species Act in the U.S. has many characteristics of a \nSMS (Castle and Berrens 1993, p. 122). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has considerable \nleeway to intrude into property rights and impose conservation of endangered species on private \nagents. Economic actions that threaten the existence of endangered species are only allowed if \n\u2018the benefits of such action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action \nconsistent with conserving the species on its critical habitat\u2019 (Endangered Species Act \nAmendments of 1978, public law 95-632). \nOne of the most fundamental problems of SMS is that it cannot define what \u2018unacceptable \ncosts\u2019 are. The reason why many people would support SMS is presumably that everyone can \nhave his or her own idea of what unacceptable costs are. Another major problem is that the SMS \ngives no guidance to which species or habitats scarce financial resources should be allocated and \nthere can be no doubt that the available resources are limited. Stevens et al. (1991, p. 399) claim \nthat since we do not know which particular species are worth while protecting, applying the SMS \nwith its focus on the costs of preventing species extinction is superior to cost-benefit analysis \nsince it can do without making estimates of the potential benefits of protecting a specific species. \nBut Stevens et al.\u2019s (1991) claim is not true: the awkward and often badly informed choices are \nsimply transferred to another level of decision-making. While it seems likely that more species \nwill be protected under a SMS regime, selections still have to be made where financial resources \nare scarce. \nNote that the protection costs are likely to be high even in terms of direct management costs \ndue to the complexity of safeguarding the resilience of an ecosystem. The main costs arise in \nterms of opportunity costs, however, due to blocking economic development in a large part of a \nnation\u2019s area. There are definite, present, real costs for uncertain, future and perhaps intangible \nbenefits in applying SMS. Also, the actual protector will not be able to reap all of the potential \nfuture benefits because some of the benefits are positive externalities to other people in other \ncountries, i.e. the protection of biodiversity has to some extent the characteristics of a global \npublic good. Consequently, there are powerful incentives to free ride on others\u2019 effort for \nbiodiversity protection. Since every potential protector has the incentive to free ride, none of \nthem might have sufficient impetus to protect biodiversity. \n16 \nThe financial constraints are exacerbated by the fact that the vast majority of the world\u2019s \nbiological diversity exists in only a few nation-states that belong to the poorest of the world, with \nthe notable exception of Australia (Swanson 1994, p. 806). There will be no way to protect \nbiodiversity without considerable financial transfers from rich to poor countries, as confirmed by \ninitial, albeit small, transfers under the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) fund and UNEP\u2019s \nBiodiversity program where the rich countries pay poor countries for biodiversity protection. \nTime and again, we have reached the point where preserving some critical components of \nnatural capital \u2014 while desirable for good reasons \u2014 appears to be a costly endeavor to \nundertake. It is therefore unavoidable to discuss the preservation of natural capital in a world of \nscarce financial resources now. \n17 \n6. PRESERVING NATURAL CAPITAL WHEN FINANCE IS SCARCE \nTo get a taste of the problems policy-makers wanting to preserve critical components of natural \ncapital are faced with, it is worth while further discussing biodiversity protection. As long as \nthere are no sufficient international financial transfers from rich donor countries (as seems likely \nto be the case), giving priority to biodiversity protection and other environmental problems can \nlead to awkward choices whose consequences we might not be very comfortable with. It is worth \nquoting Beckerman (1994, p. 194f.) at some length here: \n \nGiven the acute poverty and environmental degradation in which a large part of the world\u2019s \npopulation live, one could not justify using up vast resources in an attempt to preserve from \nextinction, say, every one of the several million species of beetles that exist. For the cost of such a \ntask would be partly, if not wholly, resources that could otherwise have been devoted to more urgent \nenvironmental concerns, such as increasing access to clean drinking water or sanitation in the Third \nWorld. \n \nJacobs (1995, p. 63) claims that in practice we are not faced with many choices of the \u2018preserve \nsome obscure species\u2019 versus \u2018improve basic health care\u2019 type, but at least they cannot be ruled \nout in principle. While we might not want to preserve every beetle as such, we might well want \nto preserve the totality of remaining tropical rainforests where the vast majority of beetles \nresides. Hence there will remain cases where fundamental ethical conflicts arise and the \nsustainability criterion in itself is not well equipped to deal with those problems. \nThis fact is neglected by Costanza (1994, p. 394) who believes that uncertainty and ignorance \nare reasons enough for preserving the complete stock of natural capital: \n \nWhile a lower stock of natural capital may be sustainable, given our uncertainty and the dire \nconsequences of guessing wrong, it is best to at least provisionally assume that we are at or below the \nrange of sustainable stock levels and allow no further decline in natural capital. This \u2018constancy of \ntotal natural capital\u2019 rule can thus be seen as a prudent minimum condition for assuring sustainability, \nto be abandoned only when solid evidence to the contrary can be offered. \n \nCostanza\u2019s reasoning completely ignores the fact that there is rarely a \u2018free lunch\u2019, that there \nis almost always a price you have to pay, here the (opportunity) costs of preserving the whole \nstock \u2014 so the benefits and the costs of preservation still have to be balanced in some way. \nUnfortunately, there is no easy answer to how this trade-off should take place. If the benefits of \n18 \nconserving natural capital are largely uncertain and speculative, economic theory cannot tell us \nhow much conservation should be undertaken because it cannot tell society how risk averse it \nshould be. It has to leave answering this question to democratic decision-making. What it can do, \nhowever, is to help finding out measures which lead to a desired environmental objective at least \ncost. Therefore we are turning our attention to ways to protect the environment at minimal \neconomic cost now. \n \nAbolishing environmentally and economically harmful subsidies \nWhat can be said rather unambiguously is that actions that both protect the environment and \nimprove economic efficiency should be undertaken. In many instances governments have \nintroduced subsidies, fail to establish and protect property rights, invite rent-seeking behavior etc. \nthat lead to both environmental destruction and to growth-retarding distortions in the economy. \nAbandoning these practices, so the argument, would be good for the environment in dramatically \neasing the pressure on the remaining ecosystems and good for economic growth at the same time. \nThese are the World Bank\u2019s (1992) famous \u2018win-win-situations\u2019. They indeed open the way for a \n\u2018free lunch\u2019: Society can have both a better environment and higher economic growth at no or \neven negative net cost. \nThe prospect for these situations is, at least in principle and theory, higher than one might \nexpect. Roodman (1996, p. 6) estimates environmentally damaging and economically distorting \nsubsidies for water use, energy use, agriculture etc. to be at least 500 bn US$. Pearce (1996, p. 8) \nstates an upper estimation bound of 1,000 bn US$. The latter figure comes close to 5% of world \nGNP! \nNote, however, that often behind these subsidies stand vested political interests, as for \nexample with the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy, which means that they are \ndifficult to abolish (see Roodman 1996, pp. 52-56, for more detail). The abolition of these \nsubsidies would come at negative economic costs, but at high political costs and would create \nimmense distributional conflicts. Sometimes there are also good reasons for the subsidies and in \nsome cases, as in agricultural subsidies in Northern countries, the environmental impacts of \nabolishing the subsidies and liberating agricultural trade are ambiguous (Lutz 1992). \nNevertheless, the reported figures give a rough idea of what could be done to make some \nprogress towards sustainability. \nIn many countries there are also likely to be many cases where environmental pollution \ndirectly harms economic productivity, either via damaging production inputs or via undermining \n19 \nthe health of the labor force. Systematic evidence on this question is scarce, but many case \nstudies have shown that often some level of environmental production is self-financing because it \nleads to higher economic productivity (see World Bank 1992, ch. 2, pp. 44-63). Of course, policy \nmakers have to intervene in order to get something done since the environmental pollution is \nmost often the consequence of some economic agent externalizing environmental costs on \nsomeone else and he or she is therefore not likely to abate emissions on his or her own just \nbecause this would be in the social interest. \n \nSubstituting market-based for command-and-control instruments \nAnother possibility to enhance sustainability while at the same time limiting the negative \nconsequences on economic growth is using market-based instruments like emission taxes and \ntradable permits for environmental protection instead of the still much more widely used \ncommand-and-control instruments. Unfortunately, economists in the past have been over-\noptimistic as concerns the advantages of market-based instruments and have often overlooked \nadministrative and political economy problems with applying taxes and permits (see Hanley, \nHallett and Moffatt 1990, Hahn 1990, Hahn and Axtell 1995, Stavins 1995). Indeed, the static \nefficiency advantages have often been exaggerated by comparing a theoretical ideal of market-\nbased instruments with real world examples of command-and-control and by ignoring the \npreponderance of uncertainty about the costs and benefits of environmental protection measures \n(Stavins 1996). \nHowever, the static advantages are of minor interest in a sustainability context. What is more \nrelevant here is the dynamic advantage of market-based instruments. Both taxes and tradable \npermits are dynamically efficient in that they induce firms not only to reduce resource \nconsumption or pollution emission to the desired level but to explore and develop new and even \nless pollution- or resource-intensive technologies in order to pay less taxes or earn additional \nrevenues via selling permits. Command-and-control instruments, whether demanding a specific \nenvironmental performance or prescribing a certain technical standard, are dynamically \ninefficient because over-compliance would not save money to the firm and developing new \ntechnologies risks inducing the environmental authority to tighten the standard without the firm \nbeing able to reap the benefits of its improvement. \nTechnical progress plays an important, if not the most important, role in overcoming resource \nconstraints and in mitigating the pollution side-effects of economic activity \u2014 so market-based \ninstruments with their built-in dynamic efficiency have clear advantages over command-and-\n20 \ncontrol instruments. There has been some increase in the use of market-based instruments in \nOECD-countries over the last decade or so, but their extent remains modest and they have rather \nsupplemented than replaced command-and-control instruments (Pearson 1995, p. 357). More \nresearch should go into the question of what the political economy problems in applying market-\nbased instruments are and how they could be overcome. This recommendation gains additional \njustification when, as is not duly recognized yet, the positive effects on sustainability of replacing \nexisting command-and-control instruments with taxes or permits are also taken into account. \n \nChanging the tax-base of the economy? \nTaxes and permits, if initially sold to firms and not \u2018grandfathered\u2019, also raise revenues for the \npublic authority. No wonder then that economists have come up with the idea of using market-\nbased instruments also to raise public revenues in order to reduce other distortive taxes \u2014 going \nas far as proposing a grand-design change in the base of the tax system of a country away from \ntaxing labor or capital income towards taxing resource and energy input and pollution emission \n(e.g. Daly and Costanza 1992, p. 45). \nThere would be ample space for such large-scale changes since it is estimated that roughly \nfifty per cent of all state revenue in EU-countries comes from taxes that are directly or indirectly \nlevied on labor whereas less than ten per cent comes from taxes on natural resource use and \npollution taxes (Tindale and Holtham 1996, p. 64). Figures for other OECD-countries are similar \n(McCoy 1996, p. 211). So far, only Norway and Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Denmark, \nFinland and the Netherlands have undertaken some preliminary steps in the direction of deriving \nstate revenue from \u2018ecotaxes\u2019 rather than other taxes \u2014 for an overview over environmental \ntaxation in OECD-countries see Barde (1996). \nChanging the tax-base of the economy towards replacing ecotaxes for taxes on labor has also \ngained some wider support among economists in recent years as a \u2018no regret\u2019-policy to combat \nglobal warming, because it is believed that raising taxes on carbon emissions and compensating \nfully with reductions in other distortive taxes will be good for both the climate and the economy, \nespecially for fostering employment (Pearce 1991, Jaeger 1995). This is the so-called \u2018double \ndividend hypothesis\u2019. \nIf the hypothesis was true, this would be excellent from an environmental point of view. The \nreason is that the benefits from environmental protection are often uncertain, as argued in former \nsections of this paper, in contrast to the direct costs of doing so. The optimal internalization of \nenvironmental externalities via Pigouvian taxes as presented in the neat little diagrams of \n21 \nenvironmental economics textbooks is very often virtually impossible in reality. If the double \ndividend hypothesis was true, many more measures to protect the environment could be justified \nsince it would not be necessary anymore to know the exact magnitude of the environmental \nbenefits. It would be enough to know that the environmental benefits are positive, however big, \nsince due to the double dividend environmental protection will come at no or even negative net \neconomic costs. \nAlso, many environmentally harmful emissions cannot be measured because of the sheer \nnumber of emission sources or because measurement is prohibitively expensive. It would then be \nsufficient to tax inputs such as energy and resources which are much more easy to monitor than \npollution emissions. Doing so makes sense as long as the link between energy or resource input \nand pollution is sufficiently strong. Referring back to carbon emissions, it would be sufficient to \ntax different energy inputs approximately according to their carbon content rather than trying to \nmeasure carbon emissions exactly at the \u2018end of the pipe\u2019. In short, the double dividend \nhypothesis seems to open the way for a much bigger \u2018free lunch\u2019 than the abolition of \nenvironmentally and economically harmful subsidies. But does it really hold? \nPrima facie the hypothesis appears to be convincing: Substituting the taxation of \u2018bads\u2019 such \nas pollution for the taxation of \u2018goods\u2019 such as labor and capital while keeping the overall tax \nburden of an economy the same should enhance economic activity rather than reduce it. On \ncloser inspection, however, economists using highly complex general equilibrium models have \ncontested this view. The point is that a tax on, e.g., energy input works its way through other \nmarkets and in the end amounts to an implicit tax on labor (tax interaction effect). This implicit \ntax has to be set higher than the direct tax on labor, however, because a successful environmental \ntax erodes its own base if the addressed firms partially reduce energy input or use less polluting \ninputs (erosion effect). Thus, substituting ecotaxes for labor taxes cannot but exacerbate existing \ndistortions in the economy (Bovenberg and Mooij 1995, Bovenberg and Goulder 1995). The \neffects on employment depend largely on whether the implicit fall in relative labor costs due to \ndecreasing the taxes on labor income will be fully compensated by higher real wages or not. If \nthey are, then no beneficial effects on employment are to be expected (Carraro, Galeotti and \nGallo 1996). Results are less clear-cut if the revenues from environmental taxation are used to \nreduce capital taxes which are generally presumed to be highly distortive. Under certain, fairly \nrestrictive conditions a double dividend is possible (Goulder 1994, pp. 12ff.). \nOther economists have insisted that a double dividend is much more likely to hold. They have \nbased their arguments more on logical reasoning than theoretical modeling, however, which \n22 \nweakens their case since the effects of taxation are usually so difficult to assess that they can only \nbe captured in complex models. Jaeger (1995, p. 56), e.g., argues that taxing pollution should be \nregarded as broadening the tax base of the economy via taxing a hitherto untaxed \u2018commodity\u2019. \nSince it is a standard result in public finance economics that second-best taxation is the less \ndistortive the wider is the tax base one should expect the overall welfare burden due to taxation \nto decline and thus the double dividend hypothesis to hold. Similarly, Ekins (1996, p. 158) \nargues that the environmental externality should be considered as distorting other markets as well \nthrough market-interaction effects. Internalizing this externality via a pollution tax should make \nother markets less distorted rather than exacerbating existing distortions since the distortion due \nto the environmental externality is abolished. \nThe debate on the double divided is unlikely to be resolved over the next decade or so. It \nmight actually never be resolved since the conclusions are highly dependent on the modeling \napproach and every model can be contested for not including important aspects whose inclusion \nwould alter the model results. It seems fair to say, however, that the double dividend hypothesis \nhas not been really proven so far and that the relationship between the environment and the \neconomy is more likely to remain one of a fundamental trade-off rather than a free lunch where \nboth environmental protection and economic growth can be achieved at the same time at zero or \neven negative net cost. That does not mean that environmental protection should not be \nundertaken, but rather that it has to be justified more for its environmental benefits alone rather \nthan for its alleged additional beneficial effect on the general economy. \nTotally uncontroversial, however, is the fact that the economic costs of environmental \nprotection will be lower (but still positive) if the revenue is used to reduce other distortive taxes \nrather than increasing the overall tax burden of the economy or returning the taxes to consumers \nvia lump-sum transfers. Creating revenues that can be used to reduce other distortive taxes also \nrepresents an advantage of market-based instruments over command-and-control instruments in \naddition to the advantages already presented in the last sub-section. \n \nRegulating tighter for increasing productivity? \nEqually contested as the call for a large-scale change in the tax base of an economy is the \nproposition put forward by Porter and van der Linde (1995) (the so-called \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis) \nthat there are many cases in which tightening environmental regulations would at the same time \nincrease firms\u2019 economic profitability, i.e. cases in which tighter environmental standards come \n23 \nat no economic costs or even at economic benefits. The idea is that tighter regulation, if properly \ndesigned, would trigger firms to innovate and thus to become more productive. \nEconomists have not found this argument very convincing (see Oates, Palmer and Portney \n1993; Palmer, Oates and Portney 1995), for mainly two reasons: First, the \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis \nassumes that firms are foregoing opportunities to increase their profitability, i.e. they are working \ninefficiently. They need a government to tell them how to improve their productivity, so to speak. \nIn a competitive context firms working inefficiently will be outcompeted by their more efficient \nrivals, however, which implies that the foregoing of profitable opportunities can at most be a \ntransitory and marginal phenomenon. Second, even if those opportunities existed and were not \nseized by private firms it is still doubtful whether the government can know any better and is able \nto design environmental regulation such that firms\u2019 profits increase. If the \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis \nwas true, then why do we see firms lobbying against environmental protection programs instead \nof lobbying for tighter environmental regulation? Porter and van der Linde (1995) cite dozens of \nexamples which allegedly buttress their case. But \u2018examplerism\u2019 is no substitute for systematic \nempirical evidence and Jaffe, Peterson and Stavins (1995) in a survey of the existing evidence \ndid not find any systematic support for the \u2018Porter\u2019-hypothesis. \nThat is not to say that firms, and even less so consumers who are not faced with constant \ncompetitive pressure, are always operating efficiently. If that was the case, how could we explain \nthe existence of business consulting? One area where it has been shown that opportunities for \nenvironmental protection exist that are not widely exploited and could save money at the same \ntime is energy conservation \u2014 both within firms and private households (Jochem and Gruber \n1990, Jaffe and Stavins 1994, Jackson 1995). The reasons for this failure are presumably a \nmixture of lack of information and awareness, lack of technical expertise and lack of strong \nincentives because of the low share of energy costs among total expenditure. Here, policy-makers \ncould help to overcome these obstacles via providing information and expertise and via inducing \nelectric utilities to \u2018sell\u2019 energy efficiency improvements. Thus some cheap if not costless steps \ntowards environmental protection could be made. \nOne must beware not overestimating the prospects for these costless opportunities, however. \nThe claim that 20% and more of carbon emissions in industrialized countries can be cut at no \neconomic costs due to energy conservation measures \u2014 a claim which is often found in so-called \nbottom-up engineering studies of the costs of carbon emission abatement (IPCC 1996, pp. 303-\n343) \u2014 is rather dubious because it neglects the many informal transaction costs that prevent \nfirms and consumers alike to seize these self-paying opportunities. That something is costless in \n24 \ntheoretical Nirvana does not mean that it will be costless in the actual world we are living in. It \nseems fair to say, therefore, that while there are some unexploited options and informed policy-\nmakers can help to realize these options, it is nevertheless true that substantial environmental \nprotection will have its economic price. \n25 \n7. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper I have made explicit why natural capital is different from other forms of capital and \nis not likely to be perfectly substitutable as the concept of \u2018weak sustainability\u2019 holds. On the \nother hand, due to risk, uncertainty and ignorance it is no easy task to name those forms of capital \nwhich are indispensable for the welfare of future generations. I have argued that a good case can \nbe made for preserving \u2018rather more than less\u2019 natural capital, especially in the form of protecting \nbiodiversity and global environmental life-support \u2018resources\u2019 such as the ozone layer and the \nglobal climate, in the form of limiting the accumulation of toxic pollutants and in the form of \npreventing unsustainable harvesting and soil erosion. However, I was not able to give exact \nboundaries. \nThe analysis of policy principles such as the precautionary principle and the concept of SMS \nhas failed to provide clear-cut policy recommendations for cases where environmental protection \ncan only be achieved via incurring real economic costs. Both principles are unable to provide \nguidelines on what should be regarded as \u2018excessive costs\u2019 of preserving natural capital. I have \ntherefore highlighted some measures that could be undertaken without major, if any, real \neconomic costs. Realizing these measures would mean to establish and protect property rights, to \nabolish environmentally and economically harmful subsidies, to substitute market-based for \ncommand-and-control instruments, to use the revenues from environmental taxation such that \ntheir economic costs are minimized and to help overcome obstacles for realizing self-paying \nefficiency improvements. Putting these measures into practice would also mean to substantially \nroll back the current destruction of all kinds of natural capital. If it turned out afterwards, that the \nworld would still be unsustainable, additional measures for the preservation of certain forms of \nnatural capital can be undertaken even if this is costly to do. \nIt has to be admitted that the analysis of this paper was not able to give clear-cut answers on \nhow much and which forms of natural capital at what costs to preserve in order to insure against \nthe non-achievement of sustainability and to prevent ex post surprise. There is always the \npossibility that we run down too much natural capital in spite of our ex ante expectation that this \ndepletion of natural capital would not endanger sustainability. Overall then, ensuring \nsustainability in a world of uncertainty and scarce financial resources is no easy task. On the \nother hand, there is also the clear danger to either spent too many scarce financial resources on \nthe preservation of natural capital and thereby to significantly reduce the consumption \npossibilities of the current and future generations or to channel the resources available for \n26 \npreserving natural capital into the wrong channels and thereby \u2018preserve\u2019 forms of natural capital \nthat are not really threatened. \nHow risk-averse society should be in making decisions on preserving natural capital and how \nmuch economic costs it would be willing to incur for doing so is not a question economic (or any \nother) theory can tell us. It is a question that has to be decided in the political arena. What science \ncan do is to highlight the prevalent issues and to provide some rough estimates of benefits and \ncosts of some action as well as looking for least-cost measures to reach a certain environmental \nobjective. But the setting of the objective itself is outside the scientific realm. There are limits to \nwhat science can and should do. \n27 \nAcknowledgement \nI thank James Putzel, Mathias Hafner and Michael Jacobs for helpful comments. All errors are \nmine.
