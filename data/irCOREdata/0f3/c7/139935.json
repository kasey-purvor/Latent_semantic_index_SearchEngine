Introduction\nEngineering design in today\u2019s global and competitive\nbusiness environment is under increasing pressure to\nperform better in terms of low-time, high-quality and high\nvalue output that can provide competitive advantage for\nthe organisation. One approach to improve engineering\ndesign is through reusing previous knowledge. Organisa-\ntions in mature markets are in a special position to benefit\nfrom knowledge reuse for three key reasons: (1) they know\nthe product well, so are able to produce high-quality\nreusable knowledge; (2) the next generation product is\nlikely to have a significant overlap with the previous\nversion; and (3) knowledge reuse allows more time for\ninnovation, which is especially important since competitive\nadvantage is difficult to achieve in mature domains.\nDevelopment time, product quality and customer value\nare all factors which effective requirements management\ncan improve.

Product\nquality and perceived value is likely to be higher if the\ncustomer requirements are better understood and system-\natically addressed. In engineering design, the project team\nrequires a detailed description of the product requirement\nso that focused design work can take place. Various\nmethods for gathering, analysing, selecting, documenting,\nverifying and managing requirements have been proposed.\nMost have been in the software development domain,\nhowever increasingly requirements management methods\nare being incorporated into engineering design as the need\nfor requirements management is recognised.\nThe research approach begins with a literature review in\ndesign knowledge reuse and requirements management, to\nidentify appropriate methods within each domain. A\nframework is proposed based on the identified require-\nments. The framework is then demonstrated using a case\nstudy example: vacuum pump design.

The\nproposals for design knowledge reuse are the result of a\nprevious research project, which is reported in the\nfollowing section on design knowledge reuse. The proposed\nframework seeks to integrate design knowledge reuse with\nrequirements management.\nThis paper will first describe existing approaches for\ndesign reuse. Then, proposed methods for managing\nrequirements will be described. Requirements modelling\nfor engineering design will then be described. Then,\nfindings from a case study are used to describe the\nparticipating company\u2019s approach to requirements man-\nagement. A proposed framework to support requirements\nmanagement and design knowledge reuse will then be\nintroduced. The framework is described using the case\nstudy data. The final sections will discuss the proposed\nframework, then introduce suggestions for future work.\n2. Current research on design knowledge reuse\nDesign knowledge reuse has been approached from a\nvariety of perspectives. Those discussed here include CAD,\ndesign methodology, function and ontology-based ap-\nproaches.\nThe CAD\/CAE research community has contributed a\ngreat deal to design knowledge reuse in retrieving CAD\nmodels through intelligent systems and case-based reason-\ning (CBR) [1]. A further development to intelligent search\nmethods, as in CBR, is intelligent retrieval of information\nthrough designer monitoring [2]. Knowledge-based design\nalso represents design knowledge reuse, and includes a\nrange of approaches such as knowledge-based configura-\ntion [3]. Agent-based methods are also applied to problems\nsuch as optimising design concepts [4] and informing\ndesign team members of project progress [5]. CAD-based\napproaches do not support design reuse at the conceptual\nlevel: their applicability is limited to detailed design, by\nwhich time 80% of product costs are fixed.\nDesign reuse approaches to that are based on a design\nmethodology [6,7] structure the elements of the system\naround the conceptual framework specified by the design\nmethodology (typically systematic design). Methodology-\nbased approaches are best suited to fundamental design\nproblems, where existing solutions are not available:\nvariant design could apply a more structured and specific\nmethod to reuse previous solutions.\nDesign reuse approaches that apply function base the\nknowledge structure on a functional decomposition, which\nis a similar approach to quality function deployment\n(QFD) [8]. In the CADET system [9,10], a flexible rule base\nis applied to describe the domain knowledge\u2014relating\nproduct attributes such as wheel size to requirement\nattributes such as \u2018easy to push\u2019. Another example of a\nfunctional perspective on design reuse is the product range\nmodel [11] which is intended to support variant design\nactivities through the representation of product functions,\nrelevant design solutions and \u2018knowledge links\u2019 betweenPlease cite this article as: Baxter D, et al.

Function enables reuse to take place at a\nmore fundamental level than CAD reuse, and the addition\nof knowledge links means that product components or\nassemblies can be retrieved based on the required function.\nOne issue with function-based methods is a lack of\nstandard method to represent function. Efforts have been\nmade to standardise the representation approach [12],\nhowever there is still not a commonly accepted method. A\nfurther, perhaps more fundamental limitation of the\napplication of function-form mapping for design reuse is\nthat the hierarchical nature of the modelling approaches\nmay mislead the application of a function relationship to a\nsubassembly which by itself does not perform the function.\nAt the base level, none of the individual parts can realise\nthe function. The relationship itself must be described\nalongside the nature of the relationship in order that it may\nbe successfully reapplied.\nOntologies in design are developed for a variety of\napplications, each one enabling reuse of knowledge\nthrough creating a representation of the domain. Ontolo-\ngies enable understanding of concepts, data elements, and\nrelationships between concepts. An automotive seat\nspecification ontology was developed which enables a\nshared understanding of the product and relationships\nbetween product concepts [13]. Another example of an\nontology-based approach is the function-way server, which\napplies a function ontology along with a product ontology\nto support conceptual design [14]. Ontology can be applied\nto the whole range of product attributes, including form,\nfunction, and behaviour.\nDesign reuse remains a developing area, and many\napproaches have been developed. Further effort is required\nto understand the needs of knowledge users and producers\nin order that appropriate methods can be applied [15].\n2.1. Process-based design reuse\nAn additional design reuse perspective is that of process:\nthe design process as a central element of a design reuse\nsystem [16\u201318]. It has been suggested that the design\nprocess is a driver of design reuse for decision making at all\nstages of product development [19]. Process-based ap-\nproaches have been characterised as one of three types:\nengineering (systematic design methodologies), business\nprocess, and CAD\/CAE based [20]. Notable process-based\nmethods include signposting and the design roadmap.\nSignposting [21] a parameter driven task-based model of\nthe design process. The method uses a measure of\nconfidence levels in key design parameters as the basis for\nidentifying, or signposting, the next design task. The design\nroadmap (DR) method provides a formal method to\nrepresent the design process [22]. The method enables the\nrepresentation of feedback and feedforward processes,\nwhich are common in design yet uncommon in design\nprocess representations. The DR process data model\nenables a variety of graphical representations, or views.\nGraph, matrix, tree and list views are supported.nowledge reuse and requirements management in engineering....

Assuming that the organisation has developed similar\nproducts in the past, a large amount of product knowledge\nis required for, and embedded in, a design process model.\nThis model is stored in the process knowledge database.\nComputational methods are applied to product data, and\n\u2018how-to\u2019 knowledge is provided in support of tasks. This\ntask automation and support knowledge is stored in the\ntask knowledge database. During the design process, an\nontology-based product model is applied. This product\nmodel is stored in the product knowledge database. The\nresulting system architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The\ndiagram shows that product, task and process knowledge\nare stored in databases and retrieved by the design reuse\napplication.\nIn a variant design scenario, a formal representation of\nprocess can be applied. The combination of process and\nontology based reuse will support a wide range of reuse\nsituations in early design: application of a best practice\ndesign process, function based component and assembly\nselection (through design ontology), recording design\ndecisions and evolving product model (through design\nontology) and methodology guidance for fundamental\ndesign problems and design analysis (through process\nrepresentation).E\n85\n87\n89\n91\n93\n95\n97\n99RR\nEC\nT\n3. Current research on requirements practices\nRequirements are the subject of an extensive body of\nliterature in the information systems domain. Some of the\nwork from this domain has been investigated with a view to\nmaking recommendations for engineering design. Require-\nments practices include gathering, analysing, selecting,\ndocumenting, verifying and managing [23]. These practices\nare often discussed together under the umbrella \u2018require-\nments management\u2019.

[25, p. 4]\nOf three levels of RM adoption, most firms are at level 1:\nan ad hoc RM process, hard to estimate and control costs,\npoor customer satisfaction, lack of RM planning and\nreview procedures [26]. Requirements management support\nis needed in engineering design. The requirements manage-\nment process records and tracks the requirements through\nthe development process. Requirements elicitation method\nselection must be considered for each specific case [27].\nRequirements analysis follows, breaking down the require-\nment. The selection of analysis method also depends upon\nthe needs of the resulting application [28]. Selection and\ndocumentation of requirements are collaborative tasks\nwhose structure depends on the management method.\n3.1. Engineering design requirements modelling methods\nDesign requirements, in product modelling terms, are\nsynonymous with product specifications. This section\ndescribes a selection of existing work that has taken place\nin the domain of product modelling with an emphasis on\nrequirements. For a more complete review of research into\ndesign requirements, see Ref. [29]. Product modelling has\nbeen applied to many aspects of design outside of\ngeometric modelling, including major efforts to include a\ncomplete design representation of form, function and\nbehaviour [30]. In information systems, problem\/solution\nmappings can be expressed as logical relations [29]. In\nengineering design however, mapping between the product\nand solution remains at the abstract level. There are\nproblems with the tight coupling of product requirements\nwith product structure. This must be considered when\nassessing whether RE methods are applicable to engineer-\ning design.\nMcKay claims that software and electronic products\ndiffer from mechanical products in that the geometry of\nmechanical parts influences their functionality, and that a\ncurrent barrier to innovation is a lack of distinction\nbetween product features that enable manufacture and\nproduct features required by the customer. Their proposed\nmethod provides a means to represent a product require-\nment that can be linked to the physical product structure\n[31]. Without a statement of requirements, optimal rede-\nsign is not possible (e.g. redesign based on a previous\nproduct shape). The representation scheme for product\nspecifications addresses each of the requirements manage-\nment stages described by Halbleib [24] excepting trace-\nability. However, because the product elements are tightly\ncoupled, requirements that are part-met by multiple\nfunctional structures will cause problems.

Therefore, due to these apparent\ndynamic limitations this method supports requirements\nspecification but not requirements management.\nMethods for modelling product specifications include\nextensions of the function\/means tree in which functional\nrequirements, design parameters and constraints are\nmodelled together with additional information about the\nrequirement [32]. This method assumes a direct relation-\nship between product function and structure. Again, this\ntight coupling of solution and structure could cause\nproblems. The solution was tested in an automotive\nsetting, where traditionally, the OEM creates the specifica-\ntion. With the specification in the hands of the OEM, yet a\nshifting of design expertise from OEM to supplier, this\ncould result in a suboptimal configuration. If the supplier is\nto recreate the specification to suit their environment, then\nthis doubles the required work. An alternative method is\nproposed [13] in which the product (seat) specification is\nproduced using an ontology that represents shared under-\nstanding of the product. The OEM can make a specifica-\ntion which is directly relevant to the supplier, and which\nstates several important design parameters up front. Not\nonly does this method provide unambiguous specification,\nit also provides the initial parameter set that can be applied\nto the configuration of the product. The ontological\nframework can also be applied to requirements manage-\nment [33] by adding information and process layers. The\nprocess layer was not addressed, and is a key part of the\nmethod proposed in this paper.\nAn alternative function-based hierarchical method [34]\nproposes a mapping between product structure and\nfunction. The representation includes purpose, function\nrealisation and function materialisation. Function can be\nallocated onto parts on a \u2018many to any\u2019 basis, enabling\nseparate function realisation from the manufacturing. In\nother words, any number of part structures can be\nassociated with realising a given function. The system\ntherefore recognises two crucial elements of product\nmodelling: that stakeholders and their requirements must\nbe identified, otherwise important requirements are missed;\nand that function is not directly linked to the physical\nproduct structure. This work was in part based on the\nrequirements intelligent information framework [35], which\nused fuzzy logic to determine product attributes from\nqualitative requirements. Each of the product function\nbased modelling approaches described here make reference\nto the functional requirements and design parameters\ndeveloped by Suh [36].\nRequirements modelling in engineering design must\nrecognise the problems associated with a tight coupling\nof product requirements and product structure. Whilst a\nmapping between requirements and product structures can\nsupport design reuse in a similar way to function-form\nmapping, it inherits the need for a shared view. The\napplication of ontology can support the need for a shared\nview. The mapping problem exists since form\/function andPlease cite this article as: Baxter D, et al.

Requirements definition and design methodology\nSeveral design methodologies exist, and many of them\ninclude elements that relate to the translation of customer\nneeds into engineering specifications. Systematic design is a\nstructured approach to product design [37]. This rigorous\nmethod ensures that a product specification describing\nproduct sub-systems, assemblies and details of their\nrequirements plays a central role in the development\nprocess. QFD requires that customer needs are identified,\nquantified, translated into technical requirements and\nsubsequently measured (against how well the customer\nneed is satisfied). The aim of QFD is to improve the quality\nof design, and as such many publications are devoted to the\napplication of QFD to product development (see Ref. [8]\nfor an extensive selection). Poor product definition is a\nfactor in 80% of all time-to-market delays [38], and 35% of\nall product development delays are due to specification\ncreep. Ullman suggests that QFD can help through\ncreating measurable design targets and highlighting gaps\nin knowledge of the problem.\nAxiomatic design is a method devoted to the application\nof fundamental principles that make designs good. The\nrepresentation of design requirements is addressed as part\nof a method to redefine them such that the functional\nrequirements remain independent [36]. It is recognised that\nproduct requirements can override the desire to make\nfunctional requirements independent, as is the case with\nside opening refrigerators.\nMost design requirements are identified during the\ndesign process, and not from the customer [39], therefore\na large proportion of the requirement management effort\ntakes place during solution generation and embodiment\ndesign. Reinertsen suggests that requirements should be\nmanaged using a progressive approach, in which only a\nlimited number of performance characteristics are fixed\nearly on [40]. He proposes that the development team\ncreates a product advert or \u2018catalogue-page\u2019 specification,\nreasoning that if it is not important enough to be in the\ncatalogue, it is not important enough for the product\nspecification. A more detailed specification simply creates\nmore constraints for the designers without creating more\nvalue for the customer.\nRequirements are emergent; a result of form. With a\nvariant or evolutionary design (the next member or\ngeneration of a product family), many of these emergent\nrequirements remain the same as the previous generation of\nproducts. By identifying relationships between these\nrequirements and the solution principles, the knowledge\ncan be reused. Additional knowledge of manufacturing,\noperation, testing and servicing could also be related to the\nsolutions.

Literature summary\nProcess-based design reuse will be applied in combina-\ntion with an ontology-based product model. This will\nsupport the application of process (design methodology\nand best practices) alongside product and task knowledge\nreuse. Requirements management practices should be\nrecognised, in terms of capturing, analysing and managing\nthe requirement through the NPI process. A minimal\nrequirements set should be sought at the beginning of the\nproject, in order to minimise constraints and focus on the\nvalue proposition of the product.\n4. Requirements management case study\nThe aim of the research is to develop a framework that\nsupports requirements management as well as design\nknowledge reuse. The literature review has identified\nvarious features that the requirements management meth-\nod should apply. It has also identified a design knowledge\nreuse framework. The integrated framework will be\npresented, and then assessed through a case study. The\nframework will be evaluated in a qualitative sense. A model\nof the framework will be presented to the company for\nevaluation and analysis. It will not be implemented.\nThis research is taking place in the context of variant\ndesign, in which a mature and well known yet at the same\ntime specialist and relatively complex product is required as\na subsystem for a larger customer system: vacuum pumps\nfor semiconductor processes. The market is facing ever-\nincreasing quality demands, price competition and regula-\ntion. The designers are required to achieve their perfor-\nmance goals with varying levels of engineering\nspecification. Vacuum pumps for semiconductor processes\nmust meet very demanding requirements for service life\nwithin a harsh operating environment. The exact constitu-\nents of the process gases used in the semiconductor\nmanufacturing process have a major impact on service\nlife, yet they are competitively sensitive. As a result, the\ndesigners may have to work with an incomplete specifica-\ntion. The products are viewed by the tier 1 producer as\ncommodity items, available from a (small) number of\n(specialist) suppliers. As such, the motivation for the\ncustomer to spend time making a detailed engineering\nspecification for these products is relatively low. The\ncapability to determine customer needs without the\nassistance of the customer offers substantial potential for\ncompetitive advantage in such markets. As such, substan-\ntial benefit could be gained from a method that enables\nrequirements management as well as supporting the design\nprocess and design reuse.

Requirements management process capture\nThis section will describe a case study that investigated\nthe approach to managing requirements for vacuum pump\ndesign. Several managers in the company were interviewed.\nThese included project managers, sales managers, product\nmanagers and technical specialists. In total, 12 managers\nwere interviewed. The interview process was semi-struc-\ntured, with the aim of developing an agreed model of the\nrequirements management process. The modelling method\napplied was IDEF\u00d8 [41]. After each interview, the current\nunderstanding of the requirements management process\nwas mapped and sent to the participant for review. Several\nfollow-up interviews took place to validate the model.\nAfter several iterations, the process model was agreed\nupon. The top level of the process is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe requirements management method shown in Fig. 2\nhas a typically fuzzy front end. Customer input is provided\nto the product development team via sales, service and\nfield-based product specialists. A competitor product\nevaluation is carried out by the technical specialists. This\nis a fairly typical approach to competitor product analysis:\nbuy a competitor product and carry out a detailed analysis.\nThe process needs analysis relates to the product require-\nment. The product forms part of a manufacturing process,\nso the specification of that process includes required\nvacuum performance and the chemicals involved in the\nprocess. The market requirements specification is a\nsignificant document, and is the main source of the product\ntarget requirement. It contains details of customer require-\nments alongside competitive targets based on competitor\npricing and performance. The process needs analysis is the\nmajor source of constraints on the target requirements, so\ntogether these two requirements sources lead to the\ndevelopment of the engineering specification, which is\nreferred to as the technical feasibility definition. The\nreference to feasibility ensures that the specified product\nis within the current capability. What this process does not\nshow is the R&D input to product development: internal\ndevelopment is a means to achieve competitive advantage\nrather than a customer requirement.\nThe process is managed without a formal requirements\nmanagement methodology. It has been found that the\nquality of requirements management methods has a strong\nimpact on the quality of the emergent design [42]. The\npredominant view expressed in the literature is that a\nrequirements management methodology is an essential\nelement of the product development process, and that\nwithout it a project is more likely to fail. However, whilst\nthere is correlation of good requirements management with\nproduct success, not all good practices result in a good\nproduct, and some good products are created without a\nclear RM method [23]. The capability to produce a good\nresult without a good RM method is likely to represent anowledge reuse and requirements management in engineering....

Process-based knowledge reuse model\nThe parameterised specification is linked to the process-\nbased knowledge reuse model. The specification data are\nstored in the product knowledge database. The product\nknowledge database is structured by a design ontology,\nwhich defines the terminology, product hierarchy and data\ntypes. The stored data are used as an input to design\nprocess tasks. A detailed task model guides the designers\nthrough the various product design tasks. As the tasks are\ncompleted, design data are stored in the system: as product\nparameters are generated or updated by specific design\ntasks. The integrated product model stores the result of the\nrequirements process as parameters of the product knowl-\nedge model. A more complete description of the process-\nbased knowledge reuse model can be found in Ref. [18].\nThe key addition in this framework is the method to\ncapture, analyse and manage product requirements.5.5.

The product structure model\ncomprises of a data set describing the solution concept to\nmeet the needs of that requirements set. The product\nstructure model is arranged in a modular fashion to enable\nthe reuse of complete product modules where appropriate.\nThe future intention is to build a series of parametric CAD\nmodels that use the completed product structure objects as\ninputs. The current situation is that the designers manually\napply the parameters to the development of the 3D model.\n6. Discussion\nThe development of this integrated product model is\ntaking place as part of a research project which aims to\nprovide a method to reuse engineering design knowledge\n[16\u201318]. The approach is based on the premise that the\ndesign process itself represents a large amount of design\nknowledge, and that by creating a formal representation of\nthe design process there is an opportunity to provide\nstructure to enable the retrieval of information that is task\nrelevant. Developing the design process model highlighted\nthe fact that many of the product parameters are a\ndecomposition of the product requirements. Product model\nparameters are used as inputs to the design tasks. These\ninclude early performance analysis tasks like product\nperformance modelling and dynamic analysis, through to\nthe initial product layout tasks. Because the product\nparameters can be related (through the process model\nand product model) to the product requirements, the\nmethod of capturing the requirements was shown to be a\ncritical input to the process.\nProcess, task and product knowledge are the three key\nelements of the design reuse system [18]. Originally, the\napproach to managing requirements was through an\ninteraction between the process model and product\nparameters\u2014that is, the requirements parameters were a\npart of the product knowledge. The extended mapping\nproposed in this paper recognises the high importance of\nrequirements not only in terms of recording the para-\nmeters, but also in terms of the method of capturing the\nrequirement and the dynamic interaction between the\nrequirement and the product structure through the devel-\nopment cycle. This is achieved through the mapping\nbetween both the functional and physical product models,\nwhich becomes more tightly defined as product develop-\nment progresses. A further contribution of the method is\nproject support. The process model provides a method\nbased on company best practices, which describes the\nsequence, data, information inputs and outputs for each\ntask in the product development project.\nThe capability to link requirements to product structures\nthrough function analysis has been shown in previous work\n[31,34]. This work extends the modelling domain to include\na design knowledge framework that includes design\nparameters, a design process model, and knowledge-based\nmethods. The relationships between the domains are oftenPlease cite this article as: Baxter D, et al.

The applica-\ntion of the design process model provides an additional\nframework within which the design work can be carried out\nusing a best practice method. The process model has\nrelationships with design parameter model, which ensures\nthat required parameters are assigned at the correct time.OF\n7. Conclusion and further research\nThe framework proposed in the paper adds requirements\nmanagement capability to a design knowledge reuse\nmethod. Mapping between the various product domains\n(requirements capture, requirements analysis, specification,\nand product structure) links the product structure to the\nrequirement source. The database structure provided by\nthe design knowledge reuse system supports dynamic\nmanagement of the emergent requirements and developing\ndesign data. The proposal was based on the findings from a\nliterature review that identified the components of a\nrequirements management method: gathering, analysing,\nselecting, documenting, verifying and managing.ED\n PR7.1. Further researchThe requirements management method described\nthrough the case study could be improved through\nsystematic analysis and a comparison with best practices\nin the literature. This best practices process could then be\ntransferred to the design knowledge reuse system. The first\nstage of this is process modelling. Product and require-\nments data should then be added to the process model.\nFinally, task descriptions (how-to) and links to additional\nresources should be added. This best practices approach to\nrequirements management must be carefully verified.\nA second area for further work is creating a formal link\nbetween the product structure and 3D CAD through\nparametric modelling. By selecting high value parts, the\ndevelopment of parametric models could further enhance\nthe design process. This approach requires careful analysis\nin order to determine the appropriate parts: not all\ncomponents will warrant the high effort required to\ndevelop parametric models. It could benefit from design\nknowledge support: a process model with supporting\nproduct data and how-to task descriptions for the\nparametric modelling process. There is not currently a\nclear path for storing such data.Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the continued\nprofessional support of BOC Edwards, and the EPSRC in\nfunding this project through the Cranfield University\nIMRC and Loughborough University IMRC.nowledge reuse and requirements management in engineering....
