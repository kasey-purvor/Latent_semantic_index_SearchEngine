The multi-\ndimensional 19-item consumer SAVVY scale helps to assess consumer competency -\nincluding technological sophistication, marketing literacy, and networking - and can be used\nfor population profiling. The scale is applied to a sample of French consumers (in French\nlanguage) and a sample of UK consumers (in English). The findings indicate translational\nequivalence for the French-language version, as well as, good fit and reasonable stability of\nthe scale in the French and UK replications. Thus the conceptual equivalence of \u201csavvy\u201d\nacross cultures is supported. However, further analysis indicates that a parsimonious 10-item\nmeasurement model in the French context may be justified. The findings have implications\nfor conceptualisation and assessment of consumer savvy across cultures. The implications for\nresearch and practice, as well as the study limitations, are discussed.\nKey Words: Savvy consumer; Cross-cultural research; Scale replication; Consumer\nbehaviour; Internet\nMarion Garnier is a full time Assistant Professor at Lille School of Management \/ Universit\u00e9\nLille Nord de France and member of the Lille School of Management Research Center (ESC\nLille - ESA Lille 2).

The strength and potential market power of technology-enabled\nconsumers working collectively to influence the marketplace poses a threat to the firm that\nmay \u201ceat up your profit margins, cut down your market share, and marginalize your sources\nof strength\u201d (Li and Bernoff, 2008, p.13). Savvy consumers are said to be adept in their\ninteraction with the firm, confident in their role in the interaction, and have a desire to engage\nin co-creation (Li and Bernoff 2008; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Vargo and Lusch 2004;\n2006, 2008). As a result of these trends, managers are under increasing pressure to modify\ntheir marketing strategies in response to the mass of demanding \u201cnew\u201d consumers (Li and\nBernoff 2008; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Wind and Mahajan 2004).\nWhile several potential indicators of the sophistication of a consumer population may\nexist, household broadband penetration is a widely cited statistic. Worldwide household\nbroadband penetration was estimated at 18% in 2007 and predicted to grow to 25% in 2012\n(Gartner 2008). Australia, the UK and France are all considered by Gartner (2008) to be\n\u2018mature\u2019 broadband markets. Table 1 shows estimated and predicted household broadband\npenetration figures from several reports. From these analyses it appears that the three\ncountries are fairly close on this indicator of technological sophistication. Strategy Analytics\n(2009) rates Australia slightly ahead at #11 in the world, France #13 and U.K. #14. However\nGartner contradicts this ranking by showing the U.K. ahead of France by approximately ten\n5percentage points until 20121. The important implication from these statistics is that\nbroadband usage has not yet reached full penetration and is experiencing rapid growth in all\nthree markets. Amanda Sabia, principal research analyst at Gartner observes that once\npenetration levels off \u201cconsumers in heavily penetrated markets are already addicted to\nbroadband, thus the future in these markets is less concerned with increasing subscriber\nnumbers, and more with addressing what new applications and\/or content will be transmitted\nover this pipe,\u201d (Gartner 2008, online report).\nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nThe increasing penetration of broadband within the population and related changes in\napplications available to consumers implies potentially significant impacts for consumer\nbehaviour including: information gathering and sorting, information sharing, purchasing and\nrecommendation behaviour, media usage, and, finally, interaction with \u2013 and expectations of -\nthe firm. Additionally, the analysts are predicting a widening gap between the technology\n\u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d (Gartner 2008). These twin trends of rapid change and increasing\nvariance within the population imply an urgent need for measurement tools to assist\nresearchers tracking these phenomena and managers who are making \u2013 or at least preparing\nfor - the necessary operational and marketing changes in order to adapt.\nThis paper aims to address the need for a generalised measure of consumer savvy. It\nwill commence with an overview of the concept of consumer savvy, and then examine the\ncase of French consumer \u201csavviness\u201d in particular. The paper will then present the\nmethodology and results of the cross-cultural replication of the SAVVY scale including\nconstruct equivalence, sampling equivalence and measurement equivalence. The implications\n1Both Gartner and Strategy Analytics claim to report measures of household broadband penetration.\n6for use of the full scale and a more parsimonious reduced scale will be discussed, along with\nthe broader research and managerial implications.\nTHE SAVVY SCALE\nThe SAVVY scale (Macdonald and Uncles 2007) is a recognition that consumer savvy\ncomprises multiple dimensions and is subject to individual differences. Consumer \u2018savvy\u2019\nencompasses dimensions of competency (technological sophistication, offline and online\nnetwork competency, and marketing literacy) and aspects of empowerment (self-efficacy and\nexpectations of the firm) (Macdonald and Uncles 2007). The SAVVY scale, originally\noperationalised in Australia, has the potential for profiling individuals and segments across\npopulations, and in assessing the development of consumer competency over time. Use of the\nscale is not yet widely diffused, and it has yet to be tested in other countries and cultural\ncontexts. Our purpose is to replicate the 19-item SAVVY scale in two different cultural\ncontexts: in the U.K., a country culturally similar to Australia, and in France, a country with a\ndifferent language and a different culture, especially regarding consumption behaviours and\nattitudes.\nThe SAVVY scale was developed following a broad-ranging literature synthesis, by\nMacdonald and Uncles (2007) which identified six themes of consumer savvy. In examining\nthe themes of savvy it becomes apparent that these are universal trends which could have\npotential implications across cultures. Each theme is now briefly discussed.\n1. Technological sophistication. The first theme underlying almost all descriptions of\nthe savvy consumer is that of consumers\u2019 technological sophistication and their ability\nthrough expanded media to realise their choices. For instance, the almost ubiquitous mobile\n7phone technology enables real-time information and applications; the internet gives\nconsumers easy access to vast amounts of information from many sources, and the growth in\nonline shopping shows that consumers are successfully harnessing technology as a tool to\nassist their consumption outcomes.\nResulting from the capacity of consumers to adopt and use multiple technologies, they\nemploy technology to improve the effectiveness of their consumption, for example, to source\nproduct information and make comparisons online (Day and Montgomery 1999; Prahalad and\nRamaswamy 2004; Urban 2004), to link into their social networks (Iacobucci 1998; Wind and\nMahajan 2002), and to exert control over information flows (Dupuy 2004; Hagel and Rayport\n1997; Lawer and Knox 2004). These trends lead to the identification of the first theme, that\nsavvy consumers have technological sophistication, and can use technology to their advantage\nin the market place.\n2. Interpersonal network competency. This refers to the general ability of consumers\nto harness a network of useful personal contacts in relation to buying products\/services and\nengaging in markets. We know that personal information sources are valuable; for instance,\nrecommendation can have more impact on brand choice than advertising (East, Hammond,\nLomax and Robinson 2005) and such sources are often seen as more credible than non-\npersonal sources (Feick and Price 1987). The advantage for consumers in having a high level\nof offline network competency is the ability to use knowledgeable friends, relatives or\nacquaintances as information sources in a product purchase, thus providing consumers with an\nun-biased source of product information to compare against company-provided information.\nThus the second theme is that savvy consumers have the ability to make use of interpersonal\nnetworks for efficient consumption.\n83. Online network competency. Greater connectivity removes barriers and creates the\npotential for consumers to access and share information right across the world and to form\ngeographically-dispersed collectives. Technology-driven social phenomena, including blogs,\nwikis, social networks, file sharing and citizen journalism, are part of a trend towards people\nconnecting and depending on each other rather than on institutions (Forrester 2006). The\ninfluence of these communities on the marketplace comes from the level of engagement they\ncreate amongst their members and their independence from the firm (Day and Montgomery\n1999; Li and Bernoff 2008; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004).\nAs online connectivity increasingly makes the world a smaller place the consumer\npotentially has a much larger number of widely dispersed connections (Iacobucci 1998). New\nideas gained from connecting with these widely dispersed sources of information may\ninfluence and change consumers\u2019 mental state and behaviours to a far greater extent than\nexposure to close ties (friends and family) (Brown and Reingen 1987; Godes and Mayzlin\n2004). Consumers that possess online network competency are able to harness technology to\nparticipate in collectives with other consumers and to access new sources of information and\nideas via the internet. Thus the third theme is that savvy consumers have the ability to make\nuse of interpersonal networks for efficient consumption.\n4. Marketing literacy. The new consumer is said to be literate (Harker and Egan\n2004), educated (Harker and Egan 2004; Urban 2004) and informed (Prahalad and\nRamaswamy 2004). Consumers are familiar with the ideas, objectives and methods of\nmarketing and have the tools and abilities to conduct sophisticated analysis, dissection and\ncritique of marketing activity (Harker and Egan 2004; Morales 2005; Urban 2004).\nAdditionally, consumers are said to know the game of advertising (Cotte and Robin\n2005; Szmigin 2003). They are adept at decoding advertising: \u201cThe consumer is not passive,\n9helpless advertising fodder\u201d because they can detect the hype versus the reality in advertising\nand extract the information of value to them (Mackay 1997, p.28). When it comes to\nobtaining the information they require consumers turn to the internet first for product\ninformation (The Economist 2005b). Obviously, much of this internet-based information\nsourced by consumers is independent of the firm. Thus the fourth theme is that savvy\nconsumers possess marketing literacy and can use this skill to their advantage in the\nmarketplace.\n5. Consumer self-efficacy. Savvy consumers are said to be more demanding and to\nhave a greater desire to be in control of the consumer-firm interaction; furthermore, they can\nmatch this with more means to take control (Day and Montgomery 1999; Prahalad and\nRamaswamy 2004; Urban 2004; Wind and Mahajan 2002). For instance, the potential for\nconsumers to form technologically-enabled collectives has created some fear of increased\nconsumer militancy (Szmigin 2003; Dupuy 2004); in these scenarios, firms are subject to \u201ca\nbusiness version of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d (Wind and Mahajan 2002, p72). Of\nmore relevance is whether individual consumers themselves realise their potential to influence\nthe marketplace and their potential to have an impact on the firms with which they interact.\nThe mechanism for understanding consumers\u2019 self-perception consumer comes from the\nextensive body of research on self-efficacy led by Bandura (1977, 1997). Self-efficacy is\ndefined as an individual\u2019s assessment of his or her ability to perform a behaviour (Bandura\n1977). It equips individuals with the belief (whether or not it is objectively accurate) that they\ncan produce valued effects by their individual and collective actions (Bandura 1997). If the\ncommentaries are to be believed, this increasing self-belief in their ability to make a\ndifference is activating more and more consumers, and thus leads to the fifth theme, that\nsavvy consumers possess self-efficacy in dealing with firms.\n10\n6. Consumers\u2019 expectations of information flows. Savvy consumers are said to have\nenhanced expectations of the firm in that they expect on-going dialogue with and support\nfrom the firm; or what Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004) call deep engagement. Consumers\nhave always expected firms to be responsive to their requests although they have often\nresigned themselves to being disappointed (Fournier, Dobscha and Mick 1998). However,\nconsumers now have greater ability to enforce their expectations through ready access to\ninformation (about firms, products, markets) and through the ease of forming collectives with\nlike-minded consumers. Additionally, with regard to their own personal information, savvy\nconsumers increasingly understand the value of this information, and are aware that there is a\nvast amount of their personal information stored on company databases (Mitchell 2004).\nIn addition, consumers are increasingly operating multiple technologies, opening up a\nmultitude of ways to connect with they firm. Thus consumers have morphed into \u201ccyber-\ncentaurs\u201d who effortlessly shift between real world and virtual channels and they expect\nfirms to respond consistently via these multiple channels (Wind and Mahajan 2002). Thus the\nsixth and final theme is that savvy consumers expect free information flow between the firm\nand the consumer, and they expect ready access to the firm via multiple channels.\nCROSS-CULTURAL REPLICATION OF THE SAVVY SCALE: THE CASE OF THE\nSAVVY FRENCH CONSUMER\nThe research question addressed in this paper is therefore: Does the notion of \u2018consumer\nsavvy\u2019, as defined and operationalised by Macdonald and Uncles (2007), apply across other\ncountries and cultures, and in particular the French culture? This is an important question for\na newly conceptualized construct which has potential global application.\n11\nA brief review of savviness in the French marketing literature\nIn the French marketing academic literature, several concepts are related to, and\napproximately cover some aspects of consumer savvy, including the opinion leader concept,\n(Bertrandias 2006), the lead user notion (Beji Becheur 1998) and work on smart shoppers\n(Djelassi, Odou and Belvaux 2008 \u2013 based on a conceptualisation by Mano and Elliott 1997).\nThese concepts are used to describe consumers who are expert, influencing, innovative and\/or\nclever in their way of consuming. However, these existing concepts in the French literature,\nalthough proximate to savvy, do not provide a holistic conceptualisation of the characteristics\nof consumer savvy. In particular, they neglect to assess the consumer\u2019s online connectivity,\nmarketing literacies, enhanced expectations, and self-efficacy. To our knowledge, no other\nconcept in the French literature can be compared to, or is equivalent to, consumer savvy as\nconceptualized by Macdonald and Uncles (2007).\nAs the trends leading to the emergence and growing influence of the savvy consumer\nare global in nature (see Table 1), there is a need for a comprehensive review of the existence\nand impact of consumer savvy across different cultures. This paper commences this review\nwith an evaluation of the savvy conceptualisation and assessment of the applicability of the\nmeasurement scale amongst French consumers.\nCultural issues impacting consumer savviness in a French context\nCultural issues must be considered in replicating and using the SAVVY scale in France\nas there are differences in technology adoption and use between French-speaking cultures\n(and France more specifically) and English-speaking cultures (such as Australia and the U.K.)\n12\nthat could have an impact on the savvy consumer dimensions. Some differences that have\nbeen identified include:\n(1) The technological sophistication and online network competency dimensions of the\nSAVVY scale might be influenced by the lower levels of technology penetration and usage in\nFrance, in comparison to Australia (as per Table 1) and the U.K. This is emphasised by\nvarious statistics: France is ranked 14th in Europe for penetration of computer and Internet\nequipment (with a penetration rate of 43% versus 67% for the U.K.). France has a smaller\nproportion of online buyers and is ranked 8th in Europe versus the U.K. which is 2nd (40% of\nInternet users are e-buyers in France versus 57% in the UK). Penetration of mobile phone\nInternet-usage and m-commerce is 9% in France but 13% in the U.K.2,3&4 .\n(2) Consumer empowerment may also be subject to cultural influences. This may impact\nthe self-efficacy dimension of the Savvy scale, which assesses the consumer\u2019s assertiveness\nand confidence in collaborating with the firm. In France, consumer relationships with firms\nmay be considered in a slightly different way, as, for example, anecdotal evidence suggests\nthat French consumers are less prone to complaining, or to legal action against firms.\nCo-conception and customization in collaboration with firms is not widespread in\nFrance. A review by Renouvel (2009) suggests that mass co-conception and customization\nthrough the Net appeared in France in 2003 yet began several years earlier in Anglo-Saxon\ncountries with various initiatives in industries such as clothes (Nike) or computers (Dell). For\nexample, the customization initiative of personalizing M&M\u2019s5 chocolate candies with\npersonal messages was launched worldwide in 2002, but was developed in France only five\n2 Source: Etude TNS Sofres (2008) L'avenir du m-commerce et m-marketing (M-commerce and M-Marketing\nfuture)\n3 French and European data available on www.journaldunet.com\n4 Though France is partly catching up: Internet is nowadays the first media used by French people (38% of media\nconsumption vs 37% for television), which is higher than in U.K., where television consumption is still ahead of\nInternet. Source: www.journaldunet.com\n5 Created in the 40's in the USA, M&M's produces and sells coloured chocolate candies.\n13\nyears later, and practitioners were sceptical about its fit with French culture6. The key\ncustomer co-creation initiatives that have met with success in France - such as, Nike ID,\nLongchamp (bag customisation) or Monopoly (customizing the game by voting for French\ncities) - are relatively recent, dating from 2008.\nDao\u2019s (2004) one-dimensional consumer self efficacy scale, developed in France, is\ncomposed of items related to purchasing and the purchasing process (information search\nefficacy, confidence and expertise in the best product choice, satisfaction with choice). Thus\nbeing an effective consumer in France may not be related to complaining and\/or to consumer-\nfirm collaboration. Instead it may be about being able to find necessary information and make\nthe best choice (usually based on the optimal quality\/price ratio or being able to find the best\nbargain);\n(3) French consumers are also quite reluctant and not confident about giving out and use\nof their personal data for commercial purposes. This could have an impact on the expectations\ndimension of the SAVVY scale. Indeed, according to a recent survey by Harris Interactive\n(April 20097), more than 80% of French people do not trust social networks or platforms such\nas DailyMotion in protecting their personal data, 97% believe it is dangerous to give their\npersonal data on Internet payment systems and 72% even refuse to give them, especially in\norder to protect their private life and avoid commercial solicitations.\nThese cultural characteristics could lead to differences in the applicability of the six-\ndimensional savvy measure since they may lead to different meanings attributed by\nrespondents to the items and their interpretation. As a consequence, the question of cultural\ninfluence on the savvy consumer concept and measure is highly relevant when applying it in\nthe context of French consumers.\n6 Source : www.ecommercemag.fr, \u00ab La personnalisation, futur mod\u00e8le de l\u2019e-commerce ? \u00bb (Personalization,\nthe future model of e-commerce ?)\n7 Source : www.vnunet.fr, \u00ab Protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles : les Fran\u00e7ais se m\u00e9fient encore d'Internet \u00bb\n(Personal data protection: French still mistrust the Internet)\n14\nCross-cultural issues in replicating a scale\nThe question of whether a measurement scale is a genuine assessment of the same\nphenomenon across cultures and countries is fundamental for marketing academics and\npractitioners. Research dealing with cross-cultural validation of scales aims to understand and\ntake into consideration potential sources of non-equivalence, so that the resulting\nmeasurement instruments can be used in a reliable and valid way in multiple contexts.\nEstablishing the equivalence of a scale originally developed in another culture and another\nlanguage presents challenges to the researcher. Three main potential sources of non-\nequivalence have been identified \u2013 construct equivalence, sampling equivalence and measure\nequivalence (Bartikowski, Chandon and Gierl 2005; Douglas and Craig 1983). In this\nresearch, we consider all three types of equivalence. However there is a particular emphasis\non construct equivalence as a basic and necessary precursor to the potential use of the\nSAVVY scale across cultures. It is essential to confirm that the relevant ideas are expressed\nconsistently across different cultures and languages (Bartikowski et al. 2005).\n(1) Construct equivalence, includes:\n- functional equivalence which is achieved when similar activities have identical goals\nin different countries and cultures. The resulting behaviour can then be assumed to be\na response to a shared problem across cultures;\n- conceptual equivalence: that concerns the interpretations made by individuals about\nobjects, stimuli or behaviours. Conceptual equivalence is achieved when objects,\nstimuli and behaviours exist identically or are expressed in the same way across\ncultures and countries;\n15\nThe differences observed between French and U.K. consumers in levels of connectivity and,\nhence consumption patterns, suggests that this is an important and necessary stage for\nestablishing the construct validity.\n(2) Sampling equivalence, focuses on ensuring that the phenomena are assessed within\ncomparable samples such that the research obtains:\n- equivalence in the sample structure, for example, similar socio-demographic criteria;\n- equivalence in size and representativeness of the samples, for example the optimal\nsize of the samples should satisfy similar statistical criteria for each population.\nThe main goal of sampling equivalence is to ensure that possible differences observed cannot\nbe attributed to methodological bias.\n(3) Measure equivalence assesses:\n- translation equivalence, which means paying attention to grouping lexical\nequivalence, idiomatic equivalence and grammatical equivalence in the translation of\nitems. The translated version must preserve the meanings and ideas of the original\nversion (Lacoeuilhe and Bela\u00efd 2005).\n- measure instrument equivalence: The measure must be adapted to the cultural context\nand norms (for example, it would be necessary to translate \u201cinches\u201d to \u201ccentimetres\u201d\nin France). The procedure of measurement must be equivalent in terms of respondent\nengagement (recruitment, data collection mode), measurement context and response\nstyles (scaling and adaptation to possible cultural response bias).\nThe methodology presented in the following section will lead to a reflection on the\ndimensionality and stability of the French-language SAVVY scale as well as giving\nconsideration to the preservation of the original meanings of the scale.\n16\nMETHODOLOGY\nAs this was an initial application of the consumer SAVVY scale in an alternative\ncultural context and given the good psychometric qualities of the original SAVVY scale, the\ndecision was made to test the French-language SAVVY scale with an adequate convenience\nsample. Depending on the outcomes of this initial study, further stages of the research, could\npossibly (a) include a qualitative phase in order to better understand differences, if any, in the\nnature of French consumer savvy, (b) proceed to generate new dimensions and items that\nmight be appropriate to the French context, (c) before considering a multi-national replication\non a much broader scale. Details of the methodology now follow.\nSample selection\nIt was originally intended that this study should be a French cultural replication of the\nstudy by Macdonald and Uncles (2007). However, as Australia is a long-way from France,\ngeographically and culturally, it was decided to simultaneously conduct a replication of the\nSAVVY scale in the U.K. and France. The U.K. was chosen for its cultural proximity to\nAustralia, however the U.K. is also influenced by European culture, and by its geographic\nproximity and specific links with France. Thus triangulation was provided by comparison\nbetween the original data collected a year earlier in Australia and two sets of data collected\nsimultaneously in the U.K. and in France. Moreover, using a British sample to triangulate\nresults helped to compensate for the methodological bias of a convenience sample in the\ncurrent study. Direct comparison with the Australian sample would be inappropriate given\nnon-equivalence in the sample structure between the original Australian study (which was a\nlarger sample and aimed to be representative of age and gender distribution in the adult\n17\nAustralian population) and the French replication (which used a convenience sample of\nstudents aged predominantly 25 years and under). Respondents were recruited from business\nand engineering schools to complete an online survey. Sample compositions are presented in\nTable 2. These indicate a reasonable level of sampling equivalence in terms of sample\nstructure and in terms of size and representativeness across the British and French samples\n(i.e. both samples are reasonably representative of the postgraduate university student\npopulation). As the data were collected simultaneously in France and in the U.K, it also\nensured there was temporal equivalence between the two samples, which may be significant\nwhen dealing with phenomena (such as consumer savvy) which are under-going evolutionary\nchange.\nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\nMeasurement instrument\nIn order to minimize methodological biases and ensure measure instrument equivalence\n(respondent participation, context and procedures), design of the survey in English and in\nFrench was as much as possible, identical. Thus the two surveys followed the same\nrecruitment process, question order, and number of questions per page, as well as using\nidentical colours and visual display of the online questionnaire. The main difference was that\nthe U.K. sample was subjected to the English-language survey originally used in Australia\nwhile the French sample responded to the newly developed French-language version.\nIn developing the French-language version of the 19-item SAVVY scale, a dynamic\ntwo-way translation procedure was implemented to obtain translation equivalence (Aulakh\nand Kotabe 1993; Bartikowski et al. 2005). Two professional English-French translators were\nemployed (French was the mother-tongue for one of them while English was the mother-\ntongue for the other). The aim was to find consistency between the original and translated\n18\nitems (see Appendix 1 for item details). The functional equivalence of the scale across the\nBritish and French samples was indicated by the ease with which the translators were able to\nagree on the individual dimensions and items of the scale. There did however, appear to be a\nchallenge to establishing the conceptual equivalence for the scale. This was indicated by the\ntranslators\u2019 difficulties in agreeing on the overall translation for the word \u2018savvy\u2019. As the\nword \u2018savvy\u2019 does not appear in any items of the SAVVY scale, this does not have an impact\non the mechanisms of the actual measure however it is an interesting issue for describing the\nnotion of savvy in the literature.\nThe literal translation of savvy in French covers two main meanings:\nknowledge\/common sense or perspicacity. In the context of consumer savvy, both translators\nsuggested various translations with subtle differences, without being able to achieve\nconsensus or to settle on the best translation. According to the definition given of consumer\nsavvy, consommateur avis\u00e98 was chosen as the most appropriate translation. Indeed, it seems\nto consistently express the whole set of characteristics defining consumer savvy.\nWhile the translation of the meaning of \u2018savvy\u2019 appears to be mainly an issue for French\nresearchers looking for an acceptable label for the scale, it could potentially have broader\nimplications when translating the concept and measures into other languages. This implies\nsome important challenges to preserving a consistent meaning for the SAVVY scale and\ncould affect any attempts to modify the original SAVVY items.\nProcedure\n8 Suggested translations were: consommateur qui a de la jugeote, consommateur rus\u00e9, consommateur avis\u00e9,\nconsommateur \u00e0 qui on ne la fait pas, consommateur perspicace, and consommateur expert. Avis\u00e9 can be\nliterally translated by sensible or wise, but our translators agreed that this term was relevant and meaningful in\nthe context of consumer savvy.\n19\nRespondents completed the survey online in their own time. They received course\ncredits for their participation. After data cleaning and preliminary analysis to check the\nappropriateness of the data for statistical analysis (outliers, normality), Confirmatory Factor\nAnalysis (CFA) was conducted with AMOS 5.0. Evaluation of model fit and reliability was\nconducted separately for the two samples and results are presented and discussed in the\nfollowing section. Having established good model fit for the 19-item measurement model, an\nanalysis of cross-cultural measurement invariance was conducted using CFA multi-group\nanalysis in AMOS. Finally, further purification of the SAVVY scale was conducted using the\nfindings from the French sample. This latter procedure suggested a reduced scale comprising\n10 items across 3 dimensions. The implications and limitations of the current study are then\ndiscussed.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nModel fit\nAnalysis of measurement model fit (Table 3) found that the SAVVY measurement\nmodel has very good fit for the French sample (\uf0632 = 175.9, d.f. = 137, p=0.01). This includes\ngoodness-of-fit, assessed by the Comparative Fit Index, at the preferred threshold (CFI =\n0.95), a badness-of-fit estimate SRMR=0.03 within the acceptable range, and RMSEA=0.04\nalso in the preferred range. (The thresholds and cut-offs are recommended by Hair, Black,\nBabin, Anderson and Tatham (2006) based on sample size and number of observed variables).\nSurprisingly, given the a priori assumptions about the \u2018closeness\u2019 of British and Australian\nculture, the measurement model for the British sample does not fit quite as well as the French\nsample. Measurement model fit is close to the acceptable range (\uf0632 = 232.1, d.f. = 137,\n20\np=0.00) with CFI = 0.92 (below the ideal threshold of 0.95), SRMR=0.06 in the acceptable\nrange, and RMSEA=0.06 also in the acceptable range.\nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE\nFactor structure and reliability\nDespite the good fit overall of the French savvy measurement model, examination of\nthe factor structure (Table 4) identified low factor loading on three items in two dimensions\n(Marketing Literacy (ML) and Interpersonal Network Competency (NW)), and low reliability\nfor those two dimensions (<0.5) (see Table 4), while the reliability of the Consumer Self\nEfficacy dimension (CF) is also below the standard of 0.7 (Nunnally 1978). Overall reliability\nof the scale is 0.72. This indicates that there may be some differences in the meaning of items\nbetween the original scale and the French language version.\nINSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE\nThe British measurement model indicates acceptable reliability for each dimension and\noverall scale reliability of Cronbach alpha = 0.84 (Table 4). However it also exhibits low\nfactor loading on the identical item in interpersonal network competency (NW1 \u201cI always\nknow someone to call if I want to find the best product or service.\u201d) One explanation for the\nlow loading on this particular item could be due to the sample profile in the current study. The\ninterpersonal network competency dimension of the SAVVY scale takes account of\nindividuals who may not have strong online network competency skills (i.e. who could even\nbe technology phobic) yet who are adept at locating sources of information amongst their\nacquaintances. As the respondents in both samples reported in the current study are: (a)\nyoung, and therefore have had less time to develop interpersonal networks, and (b) university-\n21\neducated and therefore likely to be amongst the most technologically-sophisticated groups\nwithin their respective countries, the interpersonal network competency dimension may be\nless relevant to understanding them.\nMeasurement invariance analysis\nMeasurement invariance analysis is used to establish whether a measurement tool has\nthe same meaning across different groups. The technique of scale invariance analysis adopted\nin this study uses multi-group CFA in AMOS structural equation modelling (Byrne 2003).\nMeasurement invariance tests using multigroup CFA are usually conducted in a series of\nsteps, by progressively testing increasingly constrained models that are nested in previously\nestimated less constrained models (Byrne 2004; Vandenberg and Lance 2000). As the models\nare nested within one another, the difference in chi-square between the nested models is also\ndistributed in a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the\ndegrees of freedom of the compared models (Byrne 2004).\nThe process of multigroup measurement invariance analysis using CFA involved\nsimultaneously estimating model fit for the two samples \u2013 French and British. Model fit was\ninitially calculated for a Baseline model where none of the measurement parameters were\nconstrained to be equal across the groups. Then comparisons were conducted between the\nBaseline model and a model which has all measurement weights constrained equal in order to\nestablish whether full factorial invariance exists (Table 5). In this case there was a significant\nchi-square difference between these two models, so we know that some equality constraints\ndo not hold across the population groups and therefore full factorial invariance is not\nestablished.\nINSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE\n22\nHowever, for cross-cultural research it is sufficient to establish that a measurement scale\ndemonstrates partial factorial invariance such that just two items on each dimension are\nconstrained to equal (Hair et al 2006). A comparison between the partial model and the\nbaseline once again indicates a significant chi-square difference such that partial factorial\ninvariance does not exist (Table 5). These findings indicate that there are some differences in\nthe meaning of the scale between the French and British samples.\nThe findings suggest that in subsequent phases of this research, qualitative research with\nboth French and British respondents is justified to clarify the meanings of constructs and\nitems. (For instance, a limitation of the current study is that while it was assumed that\nAustralian and British respondents might respond similarly due to cultural proximity, it did\nnot test this in terms of the SAVVY scale. It is possible, given the findings reported here of\nsuperior model fit for the French sample - and not the British sample - that with regards to\ntheir \u2018savviness\u2019, the French respondents share greater similarity with the original Australian\nsample than they do with the British respondents.)\nFurther purification of the French SAVVY scale\nThere are indications that the savvy construct and SAVVY-scale items have relevance\nto the French population (i.e. we established construct validity, found very good overall\nmodel fit, and with a few exceptions, we observed acceptable reliability and item loadings).\nHowever, in order to explore whether a modified SAVVY scale might be more appropriate in\nthe French context an iterative process of scale purification was conducted with Principal\nComponent Analysis (SPSS 17.0). The aim was to eliminate those items and constructs that\nhad poor loadings. After several iterations, where items were removed one-by-one, a 3-\ndimensional, 10-item structure was found and tested using CFA. The three dimensions were\n23\nOnline Network Competency (NO), Technological Sophistication (TS) and Expectations (EX)\n(Table 4). Overall reliability of the scale is acceptable, with a Cronbach alpha of 0.75. Though\nmodel fit (Table 3) is acceptable for the 3-dimension and 10-item structure (\uf0632 = 79.9, d.f. =\n32, p=0.01), the goodness-of-fit indicator CFI = 0.92 is now below the preferred threshold,\nand SRMR=0.05 and RMSEA=0.08 indicate the fit is not as good as the 6-dimensional, 19-\nitem model, although fit statistics are close to acceptable.\nThe examination of factor structures for the 3-dimensional, 10-item model in the French\ndata (Table 4) shows improved stability for the Online Network Competency and\nExpectations dimensions, as well as Technological Sophistication, even though one item was\ndropped (Table 4). This modified version of the SAVVY scale has the advantage of being\nmore parsimonious which could potentially benefit researchers trying to reduce survey length.\nWhat is important to note is that the core meaning of SAVVY on consumer connectivity and\nempowerment is maintained, and thus the fundamental meaning of the scale is preserved.\nNevertheless, the discarding of the other dimensions (Interpersonal Network Competency,\nMarketing Literacy and Consumer Self Efficacy) raises questions about the importance of\nthese dimensions in understanding savvy in a French-cultural context.\nSince the 6-dimensional, 19-items factor structure fits the French data in a very\nacceptable way, conceptual equivalence of the scale is shown to be effective. The question\nseems to be more one of measurement equivalence, i.e. translation, meaning and\nappropriateness of items in light of possible cultural influences. As predicted, self-efficacy\nseems to be perceived differently by French consumers; items dealing with complaining or\ncollaboration with firms might not be appropriate and characteristic of a proficient French\nconsumer. It is possible that items related to smart shopping could have been more\nappropriate for French consumers.\n24\nThe fact that Interpersonal Network Competency and Marketing Literacy were\ndiscarded in the reduced scale is more surprising, as such dimensions are most likely to be\ninfluenced by individual characteristics, such as personality, individual interpersonal\nrelationship tendencies or individual education and knowledge, than by cultural factors.\nHowever, the sampling limitations of the current study need to be taken into consideration. It\nis possible that young, student respondents have not yet developed marketing literacy and the\ninterpersonal networks to assist them in efficient consumption. Also this subset of the overall\npopulation is more educated and likely to be more technologically sophisticated and have\nstronger competencies in online networking. Thus it would be precipitous to make any final\nconclusions about scale dimensionality until further analysis with a broader sample definition\nhas been conducted.\nCONCLUSION\nAccording to the findings from our replication of the 6-dimensional, 19-item SAVVY-\nscale in France, there is evidence for its conceptual and measurement equivalence across\ncultures. This is supported by the ease of translation equivalence for the items of the scale and\nvery good model fit for the original SAVVY scale with the French sample. In addition, good\nreliability and strong factor loadings were identified for the more parsimonious 3-dimensional\n10-item scale. The consumer savvy concept and SAVVY scale are promising ways to\nunderstand consumers in a consistent and valid way across cultures. The good fit of the\noriginal model and the stability on core characteristics are indicators of the adaptability and\nadequacy of the SAVVY scale. Although the findings from this first replication cannot be\nconclusive, they do indicate the potential for the SAVVY scale to become a comprehensive\ntool for assessment of consumer competency in a networked, global marketplace.\n25\nThere are limitations in the current study design - including use of a convenience\nsample - which will be addressed in further stages of the research. These further stages will\ninclude:\n(1) Qualitative research with French consumers to explore the savvy dimensions and to\ndetermine their understanding of the constructs and items, so to better understand cultural\ndifferences that could have an influence. Possibly, such a study will generate new items\nspecifically and culturally adapted to French consumers, especially for dimensions such as\nself-efficacy or marketing literacy. Similar research is required in the U.K. and in any\nsubsequent countries where the SAVVY scale might be applied.\n(2) Further replication needs to be conducted with samples that are representative of the\ngeneral consumer population, as per Macdonald and Uncles (2007), in order to improve the\ngeneralisability of the findings\nThe concept of consumer savvy has important synergies with the Service-Dominant\nLogic and the notion that the consumer is always a co-creator of value (Vargo and Lusch\n2004, 2006, 2008). Consumer empowerment and the resulting requirement for more\nconsumer-centric approaches to marketing have been increasingly prevalent themes amongst\nacademics and practitioners. In order to remain competitive, firms are warned that they need\nto work more closely with and be more responsive to their consumers (e.g. Prahalad and\nRamaswamy 2004). Importantly, the notion of consumer savvy is consistent with a view in\nmarketing that the consumer plays a bigger role in the specification, production and delivery\nof consumer products and services (Vargo and Lusch 2004, 2008).\nConsumer savvy also has relevance to design of integrated marketing communications,\nsince one of the consequences of the \u2018connected knowledge economy\u2019 is the faster and freer\nflow of information to the consumer as well as the firm. With more information available\nreal-time to consumers than previously, they are in a much stronger position to: (a) question\n26\n(or even ignore) information from the firm, (b) find their own sources of information, and (c)\ngenerate their own forms of consumer-to-consumer communication regarding a brand. From a\nmanagement perspective, the potential for disruption to communications, channels, corporate\nknowledge management, and perceptions of value is significant.\nFinally, the notion of consumer savvy has important links to the literature on\nconsumerism which Hilton (2007) observes has been a neglected area of research. Alliances\nof consumers can be powerful and this trend is trans-national (Li and Bernstein 2008). This\nstudy provides an early indication that the SAVVY scale may have some robustness as a\nglobal profiling tool which will assist researchers and practitioners in preparing for the\nonslaught of a \u201cgroundswell\u201d of active, demanding, connected consumers.\nREFERENCES\nAulakh, P.S. and Kotabe M.
