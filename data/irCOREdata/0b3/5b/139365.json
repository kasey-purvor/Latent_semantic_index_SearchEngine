This paper discusses the problem of stress intensity factor determination in \nsurface cracks.  In particular, the concept of root mean square stress intensity factors (RMS \nSIF) is discussed for the general class of semi-elliptical surface cracks.  The weight \nfunction SIF derivation method is considered problems with the existing techniques are \nhighlighted, and a novel technique for the derivation of the RMS SIF weight functions for \nsurface cracks is presented and results are compared with numerical solutions for a variety \nof loadings and geometries. \n \n1. Introduction \n \nSurface cracks account for the majority of structural fatigue failures.  Cracks usually initiate \nfrom surface defects, which then develop into a part-through crack.  Several observations \nhave shown that these cracks are usually semi-elliptical in shape and that in flat specimens \nthese cracks tend to retain a semi-elliptical shape during their growth [1, 2].  Like edge \ncracks, the stable growth stage of surface cracks accounts for a considerable portion of the \npropagation life, which fortunately makes their inspection more likely. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \nLinear Elastic Fracture Mechanics has been successfully applied to quantify growth rates of \ncracks under cyclic loads. The Paris law [3] can be applied to edge cracks and is also used \nfor surface cracks. Traditionally these cracks are modelled using the Paris law where the \nsize of the crack is determined by two (or more) apparently independent characteristic \ndimensions.  These dimensions can be the depth and half length of the crack, or several \ncharacteristic dimensions for which Paris law is applied separately for each point.  This has \nbeen expressed mathematically in terms of the surface and the deepest points: \n \n    ( )mDPDP KCdN\nda \u2206=    ;  ( )mSPSP KCdN\ndc \u2206= .            (1) \n \nHowever, as early as the 1970s it was observed that the two material constants DPC  and \nSPC  are not equal [4].  This can be attributed to the fact that the stress state in these cracks \nvaries from plane strain at the deepest point to plane stress and the surface and that the \nplastic zone is larger at the surface points. \n \nCruse and Besuner [5] were the first to utilise the concept of an integrated average of the \nstress intensity factor in what is now known as the Root Mean Square (RMS) Stress \nIntensity Factor (SIF).  RMS SIF is defined, for the two principal growth dimensions, as: \n \n    ( )\u222b\u222b\u2206\u2206= xAxx dAsKAK 2\n2 1  and ( )\u222b\u222b\u2206\u2206= Ayyy dAsKAK 2\n2 1                         (2) \n \nwhere xyx aaA \u2206=\u2206 \u03c02\n1  and yxy aaA \u2206=\u2206 \u03c02\n1 .  These parameters are shown in Fig. 1.  K(s) \nis the value of the SIF at a point s on the crack front and the integration is taken on the \ninfinitesimal crack extension surface along the crack front ( xA\u2206  or yA\u2206 ).  xK  and yK  are \nthe RMS SIF values in the x and y directions, respectively, and are different from the SIF \nvalues at the deepest or surface points. \n \nTheir method involves definition of a number of characteristic dimensions (usually two) for \na crack; the crack propagation being described by keeping track of these dimensions.  For \nthe crack shown in Fig. 1, these parameters are xa  and ya  which denote crack lengths in \nthe two perpendicular dimensions, as shown.  Cruse and Besuner [5] assumed that the \ncoefficients of the Paris law for this type of analysis are the same as for when normal stress \nintensity factor values (i.e. K) are used. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n \nFig. 1:  Two characteristic growth dimensions \n \nHence the Paris law for surface crack growth can be written as: \n \n    ( )mARMSA KCdNda ,\u2206=   and   ( )mBRMSB KCdNdc ,\u2206= .                      (3) \n \nUnlike the multi-point approach, it is experimentally observed by various authors that, in \nmany cases BA CC = . For example see the works of Mahmoud [6, 7]. \n \n2. Stress Intensity Factor Calculation for Surface Cracks \n \nFor the cases of surface cracks appearing on plates under cyclic tensile or bending loads, \nNewman and Raju [8] have derived an empirical formula for the spatial variation of stress \nintensity factor based on a large set of three-dimensional finite element analyses.  It is, \nhowever, sometimes the case that surface cracks should propagate in stress fields that are \nnot uniform or linear; residual stress fields are a good example for this. \n \nFirst introduced by Beuckner in 1970 [9], the concept of weight functions has since been a \nwell established tool for SIF calculation for edge and through-cracks under arbitrary loads.  \nBeuckner showed that for a two-dimensional crack problem, the stress intensity factor can \nbe expressed as a function of the applied stress as: \n \n    ( ) ( )\u222b= a dxxahxK 0 ,\u03c3                (4) \n \nWhere \u2018a\u2019 is the crack length and h is the weight function.  Rice [10] showed that the stress \nintensity factor can be expressed in terms of a reference stress intensity factor and the \nspatial derivative of the corresponding displacement field as: \n \n  \n\u2206Ay \u2206 ya  \nya  \n2\nxa  2 xa  \u2206 xa  \nya\n\u2206Ax \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n    \naK\nHxa \u2202\n\u2202= uh\n2\n),(                  (5) \n \nWhere H is an elastic constant.  This technique requires numerical differentiation of the \ncrack-face displacement field, which as demonstrated by Petroski and Achenbach [11] and \nFett [12], can be troublesome as differentiation of discrete numerical values is both \ncumbersome and can lead to unstable results. \n \nTherefore, in order to reduce the number of computations needed to obtain the weight \nfunctions, Ojdrovic and Petroski [11] assumed the derivative of the crack profile to be in \nthe form of a series: \n \n    ( ) \u2211\n=\n\u2212\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\u2202\n\u2202 M\nj\nj\nj a\nxc\nHa\nxau\n0\n2\n1\n122, \u03c3 ; ( )\n20\nd\naF\nc = .                                             (6) \n \nBy knowing a number of reference stress intensity factor values known as Multiple \nReference States (MRS), a number of the unknown coefficients can be derived. In other \nwords, assuming that M stress intensity factors are known for a particular geometry under \nM symmetric loading states, from Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 the following can be derived: \n \n    ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\u222b =\u2202\u2202\na\nii aKaKdxa\nxauxH\n0 1\n1 ,\u03c3              (7) \n \nWhere i=1,\u2026,M. By substituting Eq. 6 into this equation, a system of M equations with M \nunknowns is formed which can be solved to give the coefficients jc in Eq. 6.  Brennan [13] \nhas given a more portable form of the Multiple Reference States method in the form of a \nmatrix equation. \n \nIn his classic paper on weight functions [10], Rice points out that there are cases for which \nknowledge of an integrated average of the intensity factor is sufficient for the calculation of \nthe weight function.  However, for arbitrary loadings, the RMS stress intensity factor \ncalculation for surface cracks is extremely complicated. With drawing analogy with Rice\u2019s \nwork [10], Besuner [14] used the energy balance principle for an increment of the crack \ngrowth to calculate the weight function and derived the following expression for the \naverage stress intensity factor: \n \n    \n[ ] \u222b\u222b\u222b\u222b \u2202\u2202\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202=\n\u2212\nA\ni\nzz\ni\nzz\ni dAA\nq\nAH\ndAqA\nK\n*2\n1\n**2 \u03c3\u03c3 .            (8) \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nThis equation requires that for a reference crack face loading ( *zz\u03c3 ), the corresponding \ncrack face displacement field be known ( *q ) [14].  However, since unlike the one-\ndimensional case, there are no exact solutions for the crack face displacement of surface \ncracks, accurate derivation of weight functions is problematic.  This means that recourse \nhas to be made on the existing SIF values for constructing the weight functions. \n \n3. Derivation of weight functions for surface cracks \n \nFett [15] suggested a method for deriving an approximate RMS SIF weight function based \non an approximation of the crack profile and a number of reference solutions.  It is in direct \nanalogy with the work of Ojdrovic and Petroski [11], though the unknown coefficients are \nderived in a somewhat more complicated manner.  A few problems with this method of WF \nderivation are mentioned here: \n \n1) The weight functions are complicated functions and the numerical calculations of the \ncoefficients are extremely cumbersome. \n \n2) Comparison of the two and three term weight functions (i.e. using one and two reference \nsolutions respectively) for the width direction ( ch ) for the same crack shows a great \ndifference between the two.  For o90=\u03d5 , the two term weight function gives negative \nvalues for the weight function, which is not possible and shows an error which can not be \nneglected [15]. \n \n3) Studies show that the deviation between the two-term and three-term weight function \nbecomes greater for larger aspect ratios.  Fett [15] does not give any comparison between \nthe two-term and three-term weight functions for the surface direction. \n \nTherefore a novel approach using the MRS technique for the evaluation of weight function \nin surface cracks is presented here.  One important aspect of the MRS technique in one-\ndimensional cracks is that the process of crack opening displacement (COD) derivation is \ncircumvented and a series representation of the derivative of the COD is assumed.  \nHowever, the COD field of a one-dimensional crack is mathematically simpler than that of \na two-dimensional one.  Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the one-dimensional \nMRS technique, though implicitly, relies upon having a plane strain or generalised plane \nstress state.  This is a further reason for using the RMS concept for life predictions when \nusing the two-dimensional weight function.  Starting from \n \n    ( ) ( )\u222b \u222b\u2206 \u2206\u2206=\u2206\u2202\u2202S S nn SdKKSdSSuH 00 1\u03c3                                                                          (9) \n \nAnd defining the average stress intensity factor as \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n    ( )\u222b\u2206 \u2206\u2206= AS AnAAnA SdKKSKK 00\n11                                                                                 (10) \n \nAnd therefore for the reference case, the average SIF would be \n \n    ( ) ( )\u222b\u2206 \u2206\u2206= AS AAA SdKSK \u03c6\n2\n0\n2\n0\n1 .

Verification of the Weight Function \n \nA wide range of crack aspect ratios for the semi-elliptical surface crack was modelled using \na three-dimensional Finite Element model.  The relative depth of the crack was kept \nconstant ( mmTmma 150,50 == ).  Several different surface half-lengths were used for the \ncrack (c).  The half-width of the plate was chosen as 400mm.  Figure 2 shows one of the FE \nmeshes that were analysed (here 6.0=\nc\na ). \n \n \nFig. 2 \u2013 One of the FE meshes of the surface crack.  Symmetrical boundary conditions have been used \nand therefore a quarter of the specimen has been modelled. \n \nTo construct the weight functions, reference solutions were used from the Newman and \nRaju [8] formula for tensile and bending modes.  The procedure to convert these to RMS \nvalues for the crack depth direction is shown here.  A similar procedure can be used to \ncompute the RMS SIF values for the surface direction.

The mesh was created in a way to allow SIF \ncalculations at \u03c6  increments of 15 degrees. \n \nFor the tensile and bending cases, the weight function results show a near exact match with \nthe computed FE RMS SIFs.  This is expected as the tensile and bending cases from the \nsolution of Newman-Raju [8] have been used as references in constructing the weight \nfunction.  For validation purposes, two more types of loading have been used, namely \n2\n01 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\na\nya\u03c3\u03c3 , denoted as loading 1, and \n3\n02 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\na\nya\u03c3\u03c3 , denoted as loading 2.  \nThese loads are applied directly on the crack faces in the finite element model using a \nFortran\u00ae mesh-generator and a specially developed MATLAB\u00ae code to apply the pressure \nfields on the crack face.  All the finite element analyses are carried out in ABAQUS\u00ae \nversion 6.5-1. \n  \nFig. 4 shows a comparison between the RMS SIF values in the depth direction obtained \nusing the weight function and the FE results, for different surface cracks with a fixed T\na  \nof 0.3.

Summary \n \nThis paper examined the growth of surface cracks and the use of RMS SIF values for life \npredictions using Paris law.  The concept of Multiple Reference States for weight function \nderivation was discussed and a novel weight function was introduced which is far easier to \napply than the existing weight functions for the semi-elliptical crack.  Where an \napproximation was made in the process of WF derivation, this was done carefully and \nemphasis was made to point it out.  For a range of crack aspect ratios, the values of the \nRMS SIF obtained from this WF were compared against the FE values for four different \nloading cases and the results showed a high degree of consistency. \n \nReferences \n \n[1]  Cruse T A, Meyers G J, Wilson R B, Fatigue growth of surface cracks, Flaw \nGrowth and Fracture, ASTM STP 631 (January 1977). \n[2] Muller H M, Muller S, Munz D and Neumann J, Extension of surface cracks during \ncyclic loading, Fracture Mechanics: Seventeenth Volume; ASTM STP 905, pp. 625-\n643 (1986). \n[3] Paris P C and Erdogan F, A critical analysis of crack propagation laws, Journal of \nBasic Engineering, Vol. 85, pp. 528-534 (December 1963). \n[4] Corn D L, A study of cracking techniques for obtaining partial thickness cracks of \npre-selected depths and shapes, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 3, pp. 45-52 \n(1971). \n[5] Cruse T A and Besuner P M, Residual life prediction for surface cracks in complex \nstructural details, Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 12, No. 4 (April 1975). \n[6]  Mahmoud M A, Quantitative prediction of growth patterns of surface fatigue cracks \nin tension plates, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 31, No. 6, pp. 735-746 \n(1986). \n[7] Mahmoud M A, Growth patterns of surface fatigue cracks under cyclic bending- a \nquantitative analysis, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 357-369 \n(1986). \n[8] Newman J C and Raju I S, An empirical stress-intensity factor equation for the \nsurface crack, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 15, Nos. 1-2, pp. 185-192 \n(1981). \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n[9]  H F Bueckner, A novel principle for the computation of stress intensity factors, \nZeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathemetik und Mechanik, Vol. 50(9), pp. 529-546 \n(1970). \n[10]  J R Rice, Some remarks on the elastic crack-tip stress fields, International Journal \nof Solids and Structures, Vol. 8, pp. 751-758 (1972). \n[11] H J Petroski and J D Achenbach, Computation of the weight function from a stress \nintensity factor, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 10, pp. 257-266 (1978). \n[12] T Fett, Conditions for the determination of approximate COD fields, Engineering \nFracture Mechanics, Vol. 39(5), pp. 905-914 (1991). \n[13] F P Brennan, Evaluation of stress intensity factors by multiple reference state \nweight function approach, Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 20, \npp. 249-256 (1994). \n[14] P M Besuner, Residual life estimates for structures with partial thickness cracks, \nMechanics of Crack Growth, ASTM STP 590, American Society for Testing and \nMaterials, pp. 403-419 (1976). \n[15] T Fett, A procedure for the determination of the weight function for semi-elliptical \nsurface cracks by direct adjustment to reference solutions, Engineering Fracture \nMechanics, Vol. 43 (4) pp. 519-528 (1992). \n[16] R P Ojdrovic and H J Petroski, Weight functions from multiple reference states and \ncrack profile derivatives, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 39(1), pp. 105-111 \n(1991). \n"}
