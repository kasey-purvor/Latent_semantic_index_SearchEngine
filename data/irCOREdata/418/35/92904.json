This fundamental\npolicy shift from protection to unilateral free trade has intrigued political scientists,\nhistorians and economists for a century and a half.1 While Repeal was remarkable for many\nreasons, particularly relevant for this article is that it split the Conservative party for a\ngeneration. The Conservatives entered government in 1841 with a strong and (what\nappeared to be) unified commitment to protecting agriculture, and yet their leader, Prime\nMinister Sir Robert Peel, completely reversed this stance within five years. Some of his\nparty (dubbed the \u2018Peelites\u2019) followed Peel by supporting his Repeal legislation, while the\n* Government Department, London School of Economics and Political Science.

Within a month of gaining\npassage of Repeal, the Peel government fell2 and the Conservatives remained divided and\nfor the most part out of office for decades to come. Historians have long debated why the\nPeelites reversed their stance on the defining issue of this parliament, and the extent to\nwhich the Conservative party was divided prior to Peel\u2019s motion to repeal the Corn Laws,\nwithout finding definitive answers.3 The puzzle of the Peelites is important to political\nscientists because it raises the fundamental question of what motivates legislators \u2013 and\nespecially, what motivates them to reverse their position on a crucial policy issue? At least\nthree literatures lend insights into this question.\nModes of Representation\nStudies of political representation have for many years contrasted the \u2018delegate\u2019 and\n\u2018trustee\u2019 roles of legislators. Delegates are said to represent the interests (normally\neconomic) of their constituents,4 whereas trustees represent what they deem to be the\nnational or wider public interest.5 Painted in stark contrast, delegates are motivated entirely\nby the interests of their constituents, while trustees are motivated entirely by their own\nideological predisposition. Yet, as some empirical analyses of roll-call votes attest, the\nreality is not so simple \u2013 indeed, legislative behaviour is the combination of constituency\npreferences and legislators\u2019 ideology.6 The controversy rests in the methodology used to\ndisentangle interests and ideology, and the interpretation given to legislator \u2018ideology\u2019.\nSome maintain that once constituency interests have been properly measured, deviations\nin voting patterns reflect legislators\u2019 ideology, which can be interpreted as \u2018shirking\u2019.7\nOthers criticize this interpretation of ideology as synonymous with shirking (however\nmeasured), preferring to describe it as \u2018reputational capital\u2019 or a brand name which voters\n2 While Peel carried the repeal legislation in June 1846, he was defeated shortly thereafter on a coercion bill\nfor Ireland, and resigned as prime minister. The real reason for his defeat was the Corn Laws, as opposition to\nthe coercion bill was the act of retaliation against Peel from the protectionists. In July 1846 Lord Russell formed\na Whig administration (in which Whigs, Radicals and Irish were in a minority) which lasted until the general\nelection of 1847, after which the Whigs returned to govern with increased members.\n3 N.

While the findings are interpreted with caution, I conclude that\nan abrupt change occurred in 1846: MPs \u2013 and particularly the pivotal MPs \u2013 appear to\nhave eschewed ideology in favour more of the preferences of their constituents. Repeal\nappears to have gained passage as some MPs switched from voting more as trustees to\nvoting more as delegates.\nRoll-Call Voting in the 1841\u201347 Parliament\nWithin the vast multidisciplinary literature on Repeal is a subset of researchers11 who have\nattempted to dissect the respective influences of ideology and constituency interests on the\nvotes of MPs in the 1841\u201347 Parliament.

Aydelotte biased his sample towards those divisions that were relatively well attended (i.e., in which\n200 or more men participated) and were, in Aydelotte\u2019s judgement, important and relevant to key problems of\nthe day (W.

Cox\u2019s analysis of Aydelotte\u2019s data provides ample justification for an\nelectoral connection in 1841\u201347,16 although it does not investigate Repeal per se (nor is\nthis the intent of his work). Inasmuch as he offers an explanation for Repeal, it rests on\nthe presumed \u2018independence\u2019 of the Peelites.17 Some historians have argued that the\nPeelites represented the epitome of independence from party and constituents\u2019 interests \u2013\nin a nutshell, the ultimate trustees.18 Cox\u2019s empirical support for this hypothesis is limited\nto the absence of a link between constituency influence and votes of Conservative MPs,\nbut the existence of one for Liberal MPs.19 His findings, unfortunately, do not distinguish\nbetween Peelite and non-Peelite Conservatives and so he provides no empirical support\nfor the independence hypothesis.\nMcKeown, in contrast, focuses on the Repeal votes and finds that economic interests\nconstrained the votes of MPs \u2013 though he maintains that the pace of changes in interests\ncould not have been swift enough to cause the abrupt shift to Repeal. He attributes the shift\nto the Irish Repealers (who sought the repeal of the union in Ireland) and the Peelites, who\nconverted not from any change in economic circumstances, but \u2018for their own reasons\u2019.20\nRepeal thus becomes a peculiarity of British history. While McKeown\u2019s model also tests\nthe effect of party affiliation on MPs\u2019 votes, he never integrates party and economic\ninterests into a single model. Schonhardt-Bailey integrates party affiliation and\nconstituency interests into a single model in which party affiliation is largely (though not\nentirely) an intervening variable between changes in constituency interests and MPs\u2019 votes.\nThe shift to Repeal is said to hinge upon key changes in economic interests \u2013 namely, the\ndiversification of landowners\u2019 portfolios to include more export-oriented interests and the\ngeographic spread of export-oriented interests throughout Britain. Neither McKeown nor\nSchonhardt-Bailey, however, attempt to incorporate ideological motivations into their\nmodels.\nMcLean is concerned primarily with Peel\u2019s pivotal role in the Repeal process, and\nmaintains that the Irish potato famine sparked the abrupt shift in Peel\u2019s change of mind.\nHe argues that by merging the issue of famine relief with that of Repeal, Peel transformed\nthe single dimension of Repeal to one of multidimensionality. He tests his multidimension-\nality argument on the votes of parliamentarians. He merges Aydelotte\u2019s and Schonhardt-\nBailey\u2019s datasets, adding to it new measures for MPs\u2019 and constituency ideology (defined,\nfor the most part, in terms of religious beliefs). He then focuses on just the Conservative\nvotes on Repeal in an attempt to dissect the respective influences of interests (both personal\n15 Proponents of both the trustee and delegate interpretations can find ample evidence in historical documents\nfor their arguments (see author\u2019s personal website).\n16 Cox, The Efficient Secret, pp. 148\u201365.\n17 Cox, The Efficient Secret, p. 21.\n18 The concluding sentence from Jones and Erikson (which Cox also cites) summarizes this independence: \u2018For\nif there was one attitude that the Peelites popularized and made fashionable, it was that even the most mute\nback-bencher, when it came to a division, had a duty to vote his conscience and his sense of honor\u2019 (Jones and\nErikson, The Peelites, p. 223.)\n19 Cox, The Efficient Secret, p. 159.\n20 McKeown, \u2018The Politics of Corn Law Repeal,\u2019 p. 378.\nThe British Parliament of 1841\u201347 585\nand constituency) and ideology (again, personal and constituency) on votes. His\nbest-performing model for English Conservative MPs fails to account for the votes of\nfifty-five Peelites and twenty-seven non-Peelite Conservatives on the final reading of\nRepeal. He concludes that while both economic interests and ideology affected the votes\non Repeal, ideology mattered more.\nFinally, Verdier focuses on why Peel chose to endorse Repeal and so is less concerned\nwith the decisions of other MPs. However, inasmuch as his \u2018political model\u2019 characterizes\nthe Conservative party as internally divided between frontbenchers (who sought party\naims) and backbenchers (who were motivated more by constituency pressures), he\nimplicitly models the voting decisions of Conservative MPs. Drawing both from\nAydelotte\u2019s and McKeown\u2019s data, he finds more support for a political model than an\neconomic one. Similar to the analysis of this article, he detects an internal divide within\nthe Conservative party that spanned issues other than Repeal and existed prior to 1846.\nWhile he chooses to characterize this divide as frontbench versus backbench, he notes that\nthe minority of Conservative backbenchers who supported Peel were generally from large,\nurban boroughs and faced serious contests from Liberal challengers. This coincides with\nthis article\u2019s depiction of Peelites as representing more free-trade leaning districts, with\nthe rationale that Peelites were also more sensitive to electoral pressures than were\nnon-Peelites. Yet, his work is limited in that he offers no measure for ideology; the\nempirical analysis (like McLean\u2019s) is limited to Conservative MPs; he applies an\ninappropriate model (ordinary least squares) to measure roll-call votes; and he obtains\nrather poor results (e.g., r2 values ranging from 0.24 to 0.37).\nAs this brief survey reveals, no researcher of Repeal has yet attempted to analyse\nthe combined effects of interests, party affiliation and MPs\u2019 personal ideology in a\nsingle model for both Liberal and Conservative MPs. Hence, while most agree that all\nthese factors contributed to Repeal, theory has been limited by the empirical analysis.\nMoreover, no attempt has been made to place such an analysis of Repeal into the broader\ncontext of roll-call votes on other issues in the 1841\u201347 Parliament, and so any discussion\nof the dimensionality of this parliament, or of Repeal itself, has been constrained. And,\nfinally, the empirical success of the models of these researchers has been limited at\nbest.\nThis article seeks to advance the understanding of parliamentary voting in the 1840s in\nthree ways. First, by applying Poole and Rosenthal\u2019s NOMINATE technique,21 I improve\nupon Aydelotte\u2019s analysis of the underlying orientations of opinion (or dimensions) that\ndivided MPs. Using Guttman scaling analysis, Aydelotte found that a single scale (dubbed\nthe \u2018Big Scale\u2019) captured voting patterns in 120 of the 186 divisions sampled. Within this\nsub-set of 120, the single scale could then classify according to their votes 95 per cent of\nthe 815 members. With NOMINATE, I find that one dimension classifies 89.5 per cent\nof the votes in all 186 divisions, and two dimensions classify 92.04 per cent of the votes.22\nThus scaling techniques that rely on both deterministic and probabilistic models find a\nhighly structured voting pattern (or low dimensionality) for this parliament, meaning that\ndecisions on each roll call can be linked to decisions on other roll-call votes. While this\n21 K. T. Poole and H. Rosenthal, \u2018Patterns of Congressional Voting\u2019, American Journal of Political Science,\n35 (1991), 228\u201378; Poole and Rosenthal, Congress.\n22 Another way to evaluate the fit of their model is to see how much NOMINATE improves on a benchmark\nmodel by estimating the proportional reduction in error (PRE) of NOMINATE over the benchmark (Poole and\nRosenthal, Congress, p. 30). Here, the aggregate proportional reduction in error (APRE) for the first dimension\nis 0.692, and for the second dimension is 0.753.\n586 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nstructure is an abstraction, I argue that it provides a crude representation of the ideological\npositions of MPs.23 I then attempt to refine this measure of ideology by adapting a version\nof Kalt and Zupan\u2019s \u2018residualization approach\u2019,24 thereby dividing the NOMINATE scores\ninto three components \u2013 party, constituency interests and a residual. The residual is argued\nto constitute an improved measure of MP ideology.\nSecondly, I analyse the votes on, and leading up to, Repeal, using party, interests and\nideology, and with this model I am able to account for 97 to 99 per cent of the votes.\nThirdly, my findings call into question the presumed \u2018independence\u2019 of the Peelites as\nthey voted for Repeal. Indeed I show just the opposite \u2013 in so far as Peelites voted as\ntrustees, they did so only up to 1846. Their conversion to Repeal did not demonstrate their\ncommitment to beliefs independent of their constituents; rather, their conversion reflected\na departure from voting more as trustees to voting more as delegates.\nWhen Ideology Matters Less\nPolitical scientists in a variety of subdisciplines have sought to establish the importance\nof ideas and ideology as causal factors in policy making.25 The goal of much of this\nliterature is to specify the conditions under which ideas or ideology become relevant for\npolicy making. Often the supposition is that interests form the core of behavioural\nmotivation, but that ideology can sometimes intersect with, or override this motivation.\nThe interesting twist offered by this article is that I show how ideology was dissipated as\na causal force, to be replaced in part by constituents\u2019 interests. Rather than identifying\nwhere ideology mattered, I demonstrate where ideology came to matter less in a crucial\npolicy shift.\nTHE ARGUMENT IN BRIEF\nAs the title of this article suggests, ideology, partisanship and constituency interests all\nmost likely played a role in the progression to Repeal; however, the aim of this article is\nto disentangle these three causal factors in order to assess their relative importance in the\nfinal decision. I argue that while the Conservative party shared a distinct ideology \u2013 namely,\n23 Dimensions in roll-call votes are essentially abstractions that capture the structure of voting across a wide\nset of topics. Low dimensionality (particularly relative to the range of issues) can suggest a greater role for ideology.\nIf, for instance, a high percentage of votes can be correctly classified with just one dimension, it is likely that a\nsingle left\u2013right (liberal\u2013conservative) ideological continuum is a good predictor of the votes. Further dimensions\nmay capture other ideological divisions or may reflect cleavages in interests. Moreover, while an ideological\ndimension may reflect party loyalties, party may comprise just one element of this dimension. Hence, ideology\nand party are not necessarily synonymous.\n24 Kalt and Zupan, \u2018The Apparent Ideological Behavior of Legislators\u2019.\n25 A few examples include P. A.

One faction was the non-Peelite Conservatives, who voted to\nretain protection. The vast majority of these MPs represented highly rural and agricultural\ndistricts. The other faction was the Peelite Conservatives, who voted with Peel\u2019s motion\nfor Repeal. Peelites represented districts with both agricultural interests and industry\ninterests, though tending towards protectionism relative to the opposition Liberals. Hence\nthe non-Peelite Conservatives represented districts with \u2018hard core\u2019 protectionist interests,\nwhile the Peelites represented districts with \u2018soft core\u2019 protectionist interests, wavering on\nfree trade. Yet from 1841 to 1845, the Peelites voted with their Conservative colleagues\nto retain protection, with the aim of preserving Conservative party unity, and thereby,\ntraditional British institutions \u2013 even though this conflicted with their representation of\nevolving free-trade interests. For Peelites, ideology and constituency interests were more\nlikely to conflict, whereas for non-Peelite Conservatives, they were more likely to coincide.\nIn 1846, Peel\u2019s introduction of the Repeal legislation shattered the ideology that was the\nglue of the Conservative party, leaving both factions to vote more according to the interests\nof their constituents.\nTo disentangle ideology, party affiliation and constituency interests, I employ a number\nof methodologies, but most notably Poole and Rosenthal\u2019s NOMINATE technique and\nKalt and Zupan\u2019s \u2018residualization approach\u2019. The intent is not to position ideology, party\nand interests in competing roles, but rather to estimate the contribution of these causal\nfactors to the voting behaviour of parliamentarians as they approached the ultimate\ndecision that in effect ended Peel\u2019s government. NOMINATE scores serve as a first\ncut into measuring MP \u2018ideology\u2019, while an adapted version of the Kalt and Zupan\nmethod is used to divide this measure into three contributing components \u2013 party,\nconstituency interests and a residual which is argued to be a proxy measure of MP personal\nideology.\nThe next section outlines the methodology that generates the measure of MPs\u2019 ideology\nas used in this article. The following section applies the NOMINATE technique to\nthe 1841\u201347 Parliament, and discusses how the NOMINATE coordinates intersect\nwith party groups and constituency interests. The section after that dissects the first\ndimension coordinate into party, constituency interests and MPs\u2019 ideology in order to\n(a) gauge the extent to which MPs voted as delegates or trustees in the repeal votes;\nand (b) present a rationale, based on empirical analysis, for the Peelites abruptly shifting\ntheir position from protection to free trade, thereby ensuring the passage of Repeal in 1846.\nThe penultimate section explores the relevance of commonly used interpretations of\nideology \u2013 that is, shirking and reputation-building \u2013 for the case of Repeal. A conclusion\nfollows.\nMETHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO MEASURING IDEOLOGY, PARTY AND\nINTERESTS\nIdeology is notoriously difficult to measure, and even more so when the political actors\nunder scrutiny are in the domain of history. Yet because ideology lies at the heart of the\npuzzle of the Peelites, some measurement is required. This article draws upon two\nrecognized approaches for measuring legislators\u2019 ideology. Neither method is, however,\nfaultless.\n588 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nNOMINATE\nPoole and Rosenthal\u2019s NOMINATE technique is said to improve upon alternative methods\nof analysing roll-call voting, such as factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling.26 It has,\nhowever, received some criticism.27 While Poole and Rosenthal have addressed some of\nthese concerns,28 others remain unresolved. Hence, NOMINATE\u2019s finding of low\ndimensionality for the 1841\u201347 Parliament should be treated with some caution. None the\nless, it is also fair to say that as the cruder (but more transparent) Guttman scaling technique\nalso revealed low dimensionality, outright scepticism is probably unwarranted.29\nAn analysis of dimensionality serves two fundamental purposes for this study. First, the\nprimary dimension obtained from NOMINATE provides a crude measurement for MPs\u2019\nideology, which can then be dissected using the Kalt and Zupan method. Secondly, by\nknowing the structure of the overall voting pattern, we can evaluate the extent to which\nthe ultimate repeal vote deviated from this structure.\nKalt and Zupan Method\nKalt and Zupan have developed a technique for measuring the influence of ideology,\nparticularly as distinct from constituency interests. Using a principal\u2013agent perspective,\nthe authors maintain that legislators who vote according to their ideology \u2018shirk\u2019 by failing\nto meet their obligations as agents of their principals (constituents\/voters).\nI adopt the basic Kalt and Zupan approach, but adapt it in a way that attempts both to\naddress some of the criticisms levelled against the authors for including legislators\u2019 party\naffiliation as a predictor,30 and produce discrete measures for interests, party and MP\npersonal ideology. Specifically, I substitute the first dimension coordinates from\nNOMINATE for the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) rating, and then include\nfour variables to measure constituency interests,31\nNOMINATE coordinate 1\u0002 f (constituents\u2019 interests)\u0005 error1. (1)\nThis produces a fitted value, which I call constituency interests, and a residual value\n(error1). The former can be thought of as that portion of the first dimension coordinate that\nis accounted for by constituency interests, while error1 retains elements of both MP\nideology and party affiliation. Unlike Kalt and Zupan, I do not include the legislator\u2019s party\naffiliation in this first equation. Rather, I introduce MP party affiliation as a predictor of\nerror1 in a second regression,\n26 Poole and Rosenthal, Congress, pp. 51\u20137; E.

(2)\nEquation 2 produces a fitted value for party and a residual value (error2). Party can be\nthought of as that portion of the first dimension that is accounted for by MPs\u2019 party\naffiliation. At the same time, however, MPs\u2019 party affiliation also reflects the partisan\npreferences of constituents. And so, at the parliamentary level, this variable captures MP\nparty affiliation, but at the constituency level, it serves as a proxy for the partisanship of\nconstituents.32 Error2 is, by definition, that portion of the first dimension coordinate that\nwe cannot explain by interests and party affiliation but, by interpretation, it is a measure\nof MPs\u2019 ideology. Having stripped the first dimension coordinate of its interests and party\ncomponents, we obtain a measure of MPs\u2019 ideology that is not simply a summary statistic\nfor policy issue positions. This measure is not, however, unproblematic, as I discuss later.\nAPPLYING NOMINATE TO THE PARLIAMENT OF 1841\u201347\nBecause the focus of this article is on one parliament, I use a static NOMINATE model\nrather than a dynamic one, and so legislators are assumed to have fixed coordinates. The\nroll-call votes used here include all of the divisions from the original Aydelotte dataset.\nHowever, as data on the economic composition of constituencies are not available for\nScotland, Wales and Ireland, only English MPs (who cast at least twenty-five votes)33 are\nincluded in the analysis. These limitations reduce the available number of cases from 590\nto 483 MPs.34\nAs one dimension classifies almost 90 per cent of the votes (with a second dimension\nadding only marginal improvement), the analysis of this article focuses on the first\ndimension. The first dimension coordinates obtained from NOMINATE appear to reflect\nwell the revealed preferences of MPs on the major issue that divided the parliament, free\ntrade or protection.35 The first dimension correctly classifies approximately 98 per cent of\nthe votes in motions for Repeal in the years leading up to 1846, with about seven errors\nfor each vote.36 This success declines somewhat for the critical vote in 1846, where 95.8\nper cent of the votes are correctly classified, the PRE is 0.905, and the errors climb to\n32 Overall partisanship by electors declined markedly from 1841 to 1847. An analysis of split votes (where\nelectors in double-member districts split their votes between the two major parties, voting both for a Conservative\nand for a Liberal) and non-partisan plumping rates (where electors used only one of their two votes for a candidate\nwhen a candidate of the same party was available) reveals that the 1841 election was far more partisan than was\nthe 1847 election (Cox, The Efficient Secret).\n33 The program used to generate the NOMINATE scores includes only those legislators who cast at least\ntwenty-five votes.\n34 Owing to the considerable turnover in MPs during 1841\u201347, the Aydelotte dataset contains 815 MPs (i.e.,\nthe total number of MPs who sat at some point during the life of the parliament), while only 658 MPs sat in\nparliament at any one time (and only 656 after the disfranchisement of Sudbury in 1844). Hence the 590 English\nMPs (reduced to 483 after deducting those who failed to cast at least twenty-five votes) include members who\nsat for a short period and ones who sat for the entire parliament.\n35 A rank order list of MPs by the first dimension coordinates provides some support for trade policy as the\nunderlying force to the first dimension: the three leading free traders \u2013 Richard Cobden, John Bright and Charles\nVilliers, who consistently voted for free trade \u2013 are at the top of the list, with Cobden in the lead. Conversely,\nprotectionist MPs are at the bottom.\n36 Four critical motions for repeal are analysed, all of which reflected annual attempts by Charles Villiers, MP,\nto repeal the Corn Laws. The dates for these motions are 11 July 1842; 15 May 1843; 26 June 1844; and 10 June\n1845. The percentage of votes correctly classified, PRE and errors for each division, are: 1842 \u2013 97.5 per cent,\n0.963 (7 errors); 1843 \u2013 97.9 per cent, 0.972 (8 errors); 1844 \u2013 98.0 per cent, 0.972 (7 errors); and 1845 \u2013 98.3\nper cent, 0.975 (5 errors).\n590 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nseventeen.37 In fact, the classification success of both dimensions falls somewhat over the\ncourse of the parliament, but particularly in 1846 and 1847.38 It is plausible that a new\npolicy issue (not captured by NOMINATE) began to replace trade policy. A study of voting\npatterns after 1847 could better resolve this uncertainty, as it would provide a longer time\nframe for gauging the dimensionality of roll-call votes. However, inasmuch as research\nhas shown that party discipline was low in parliament and the constituencies from Repeal\nuntil the late 1850s,39 any new issue dimension that could have replaced trade policy as\nthe fundamental conflict would have done so in a period when party structure had shattered\n(particularly 1846\u201347). Moreover, the history of British politics offers no clear view as to\nwhat might have constituted a single underlying orientation of opinion (other than trade\npolicy) at the time of Repeal and its immediate aftermath.\nAn analysis of the overlap of the first dimension with party affiliation reveals more.\nRoughly speaking, the parties split on the question of free trade, with the majority of\nLiberals favouring free trade and \u2013 at least until the intra-party split in 1846 \u2013 the vast\nmajority of the Conservatives favouring protection. Hence, a simple density plot of the\ncoordinates of MPs for the first dimension should reflect a Liberal cluster and a\nConservative cluster. Figure 1 confirms this expectation, as a clear gap separates the\nConservatives from the Liberals, thereby illustrating the overlap between party affiliation\npositions on trade policy and the first dimension.\nA more refined party breakdown lends further support to this interpretation. Figure 2\nshows a density plot of the spatial positions of MPs, but with a four-party classification\n\u2013 non-Peelite Conservatives, Peelite Conservatives, Whigs\/Liberals, and Reformers.40\nFig. 1. Two-party distribution within NOMINATE\u2019s first dimension coordinate\n37 While their procedure allows the analysis of individual roll-call votes, Poole and Rosenthal note that their\nestimates of roll-call outcomes are less reliable than are their estimates for the spatial locations of legislators or\nthe cutting lines. Hence, certain roll calls will exhibit a large number of misclassified votes while others will have\nfew or no errors.\n38 There appears to be a decline in the classification success of both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nmodels over the course of the parliament. For further discussion, see author\u2019s personal website.\n39 Cox, The Efficient Secret.\n40 This classification is from Aydelotte.\nThe British Parliament of 1841\u201347 591\nFig. 2. Major party groupings within NOMINATE\u2019s first dimension coordinate\nAlong the first dimension, MPs divide into these four clusters: non-Peelite Conservatives,\nPeelite Conservatives, Whigs\/Liberals and Reformers (the mean of the first dimension for\neach of these, respectively, is \u00030.032, 0.249, 0.712 and 0.788).41 Non-Peelite\nConservatives are less tightly clustered (that is, they occupy more issue space) than any\nof the other three party categories. The Peelites are, in contrast, more tightly clustered with\nonly a very slight positive skew, meaning that they occupied less issue space than the\nnon-Peelite Conservatives. The first dimension coordinates of Liberals and Reformers are\nfairly evenly distributed, but \u2013 as expected \u2013 clustered near to the free-trade end of the\nspectrum.\nThe distinct spike in the Peelite distribution supports the contention that the Peelites\nthought about issues differently from non-Peelite Conservatives \u2013 and that they did so well\nbefore 1846.42 Yet, the possibility remains that this distribution may instead be capturing\na tautology. That is, the first dimension may simply be capturing MPs\u2019 votes in May 1846,\nand so the Peelites were distinct because they voted distinctly in 1846. Aydelotte\u2019s original\nGuttman scales can be used to test whether the Peelites and non-Peelite Conservatives\nexhibited distinct voting patterns on roll calls that were unrelated to Repeal. A two-tailed\nsimple t-test for equality of means reveals that the scores of Peelites were indeed\nsignificantly different from those of non-Peelite Conservatives on sixteen out of the\nnineteen scales that were unrelated to Repeal.43 Moreover, the same test applied to\n41 Further investigation reveals that the content of the second dimension is the conflict over factory legislation\n(see author\u2019s personal website).\n42 A two-tailed t-test for equality of means for the Peelites and non-Peelites indicates that the difference is\nsignificant at the 1 per cent level.\n43 Not included in the total of nineteen are the Corn Laws scale, the Big Scale and the Conservative Party scale\n(for which, differences in the means of the two groups are statistically significant at the 1 per cent level). Differences\nin the means for the two groups in the Landed Interest, Religion, and Enlarged Canada Wheat scales are all\nstatistically insignificant. Differences in the means for the Working Class Distress scale are significant at 5 per\ncent, while those for the remaining fifteen scales are significant at the 1 per cent level.\n592 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nMcLean\u2019s revised version of seven of these scales44 shows that the differences between\nthe two groups are, again, statistically significant.45\nFigure 2 can be supplemented with contingency tables of constituency types and party\naffiliation to underscore the notion of parties as coalitions of interests-based alliances.\nTables 1 and 2 illustrate that the Conservative party was forged from two alliances of\neconomic interests.46 The strident protectionists (non-Peelites) represented mostly\nagricultural districts with protectionist interests, while the moderate protectionists\n(Peelites) represented a mixture of agricultural and industry-oriented districts. From\nTable 1, it is clear that the Peelites, Whigs\/Liberals and Reformers were all predominantly\nfrom boroughs while the non-Peelites were evenly split between county and borough\ndistricts. As this split depicts a rural\/urban divide, Peelites were more likely to represent\nfree-trade leaning interests than were non-Peelites. Table 2 lists districts according to their\neconomic orientation, from \u2018most protectionist\u2019 to \u2018most free trade\u2019. Once again, the\nvast majority of Peelites represented \u2018protectionist oriented\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 districts (very\nsimilar to those represented by the free-trading Liberals and Reformers), while the vast\nmajority of non-Peelites represented the \u2018most protectionist\u2019 and \u2018protectionist oriented\u2019\ndistricts.\nThis configuration is consistent with the argument that the Peelites supported their\nfellow Conservatives as long as what was at stake was the long-term interest of party\nunity.47 Protection, therefore, was subsumed within the broader Conservative party\ndefence of traditional British institutions, even though it did not square well with the\npreferences of some of the Peelites\u2019 constituents. But, once voting for protection no longer\nserved the Peelites\u2019 desire for party unity \u2013 as Peel\u2019s support for Repeal in 1846 foreclosed\nthis outcome \u2013 their voting behaviour reflected their interest in more closely representing\ntheir constituents\u2019 preferences. For Peelites, this meant that protection ceased to form part\nof the bundle of traditional British institutions. In brief, the Conservative party was an\nTABLE 1 Association Between MP Party Affiliation and District Type\nNon-Peelite Whigs\/\nDistrict type Conservatives Peelites Liberals Reformers Total\nCounty 140 14 21 5 180\n(50.9%) (15.4%) (14.0%) (6.8%) (30.5%)\nBorough 135 77 129 69 410\n(49.1%) (84.6%) (86.0%) (93.2%) (69.5%)\nTotal 275 91 150 74 590\n(100%) (100%) (100%) (100%) (100%)\n44 McLean, \u2018Interests and Ideology\u2019.\n45 The differences in means for McLean\u2019s three revised Canada Wheat scales are significant at the 5 per cent\nlevel, while those for his remaining revised scales are significant at the 1 per cent level.\n46 Regressing the two blocks of Conservatives on four constituency interests variables obtains a weak but\nsignificant correlation.

First, while spatial positions\nrevealed by NOMINATE are the product of votes by MPs on all divisions over the duration\nof the parliament, they provide no information on why MPs voted as they did. We know\nthat their votes reveal a pattern but we do not know what explains the pattern of the first\ndimension. It is tempting to suggest that it must reflect the major conflict of the parliament,\nnamely trade policy. But that is not enough: the aim here is to identify separately the\ncontributions to explaining that pattern from MPs\u2019 ideology, party affiliation and\nconstituency interests. To do this requires more detailed analysis to sort out the appropriate\nweights for these three influences.\nDissecting Interests, Party and MP Ideology: The \u2018Errors\u2019\nA very simple way to begin to identify the role for constituency interests in the critical\nRepeal division of 1846 is to study those seventeen MPs whose votes could not be correctly\nclassified (by a one-dimensional NOMINATE model). Table 3 lists the seventeen MPs,\nalong with their constituency, party affiliation, first dimension coordinate and four\nindicators of constituency economic composition. The first two indicators are measures\nof portfolio diversification by landowners, based on death duty registers and income tax\nreturn schedules.

According to a spatial\nmodel, they should have voted for free trade but failed to do so in 1846. Conversely, the\nerrors in the lower section are free traders \u2013 but were designated as protectionists by their\nother votes in the 1841\u201347 Parliament. Comparing the means of the first dimension scores,\nwe can see that the protectionist MPs averaged a considerably higher score than did the\nfree traders \u2013 which is, of course, another way of illustrating the errors in predicting these\nvotes. Notably, the protectionist errors are on average further from the cut point (i.e., the\npoint that divides the Yea and the Nay votes) than the free trade errors \u2013 that is, they are\n\u2018bigger\u2019 errors. Yet the means of all four economic interest variables would place each\ngroup in the correct voting camp: the average scores for the free traders are all larger than\nthose for the protectionists, which is what an economic interest model would predict.\nBecause the groups are very small, we cannot say that the means are statistically\nsignificant49 \u2013 however, as the story is consistent across all four variables, we can conclude\nthat there is some further support for the role of constituency economic interests affecting\nthe votes of these MPs.\nDissecting Interests, Party and MP Ideology: The Schism between Non-Peelites and\nPeelites\nThe model presented earlier provides a more comprehensive way to assess the extent to\nwhich MPs voted as trustees and\/or delegates.50 Equations 1 and 2 dissect the first\ndimension coordinate into three variables \u2013 constituency interests, party and MP ideology.\nFigure 3 provides density plots of these three variables, along with the original\nFig. 3.

The bi-modal distribution of the first dimension coordinate\nreflects the two major-party divisions, with Conservatives on the left and Liberals on the\nright (as seen in Figure 1). Constituency interests is a more dispersed measure, but\nnonetheless illustrates a prominent clustering of free-trade oriented interests towards the\nright side of the graph. The party variable simply illustrates the four party subgroups (as\ncomponents of the first dimension coordinate). Most revealing, MP ideology, once stripped\nof interests and party, begins to resemble a normal distribution, albeit with a negative skew.\nWhile it is tempting simply to assume that this residual term provides an adequate measure\nof MP personal ideology, it remains a logical possibility that it may be a consequence rather\nthan a determinant of votes in parliament (and therefore cannot be considered to be\nexogenous in a model of voting behaviour). It is also conceivable that this variable reflects\nthe pattern of ideological consistency imposed by the national parties. While it may be\nimpossible to say with absolute certainty that this variable is an acceptable proxy for MP\nideology, Figures 4, 5, and 6 help to clarify that this variable does indeed appear to measure\na normal left\u2013right ideological continuum, with left leaning towards free trade and right\nleaning towards protection.51\nFigures 4 and 5 are density plots of MP ideology, with groupings for district type and\ndistrict economic orientation. Both plots tell the same story: MPs from rural, agricultural\ndistricts (which opposed repeal most stridently) were to the \u2018right\u2019 in their ideological\norientation, while MPs from districts with more urban\/industrial interests (which viewed\nRepeal more favourably) were near to the centre, or slightly left of centre in their\nFig. 4. New MP ideology by district type\n51 Hence, MP ideology differs from the first dimension coordinate in Figures 1 and 2, where parties situated\ntowards one end of the spectrum supported protection and those to the other supported free trade. This\ntransformation of the ideological spectrum is a feature of stripping the party component from the first dimension\ncoordinate in order to arrive at a \u2018purer\u2019 measure of MP ideology.\nThe British Parliament of 1841\u201347 597\nFig. 5.

That this measure coincides with the interests of constituents\nshould be no surprise, as others have found that constituents tended to select like-minded\nMPs, and MPs, in turn, tended to select constituencies in which they could win.52 Of\n52 Cox, The Efficient Secret, p. 151.\n598 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n4\nM\not\nio\nns\nfor\nR\nep\nea\nlf\nro\nm\n18\n42\nto\n18\n46\nV\nar\nia\nbl\ne\n11\nJu\nly\n18\n42\n15\nM\nay\n18\n43\n26\nJu\nne\n18\n44\n10\nJu\nne\n18\n45\n15\nM\nay\n18\n46\nC\non\nst\nan\nt\n\u0003\n23\n.0\n76\n**\n\u0003\n42\n.0\n30\n**\n*\n\u0003\n22\n.7\n13\n**\n*\n\u0003\n22\n.2\n72\n**\n*\n\u0003\n3.\n16\n8*\n**\n(9\n.13\n2)\n(1\n2.0\n08\n)\n(5\n.86\n7)\n(7\n.79\n3)\n(0\n.99\n7)\nC\non\nst\nitu\nen\ncy\nin\nte\nre\nst\ns\n51\n.3\n02\n**\n67\n.5\n73\n**\n*\n48\n.5\n87\n**\n*\n42\n.3\n78\n**\n*\n12\n.6\n36\n**\n*\n(2\n1.4\n18\n)\n(1\n9.2\n49\n)\n(1\n3.3\n06\n)\n(1\n4.1\n27\n)\n(3\n.26\n8)\nPa\nrty\n25\n.6\n81\n**\n*\n55\n.6\n20\n**\n*\n20\n.9\n24\n**\n*\n32\n.6\n33\n**\n*\n24\n.6\n21\n**\n*\n(7\n.52\n2)\n(1\n6.2\n22\n)\n(5\n.05\n5)\n(1\n2.0\n54\n)\n(4\n.02\n0)\nM\nP\nid\neo\nlo\ngy\n32\n.4\n25\n**\n51\n.1\n53\n**\n*\n30\n.0\n86\n**\n*\n32\n.7\n04\n**\n*\n2.\n10\n1\n(1\n3.3\n97\n)\n(1\n4.7\n80\n)\n(8\n.64\n2)\n(1\n2.1\n44\n)\n(2\n.34\n3)\nSe\nco\nnd\ndi\nm\nen\nsi\non\nc\no\no\nrd\nin\nat\ne\n\u0003\n1.\n22\n1\n\u0003\n1.\n97\n4\n\u0003\n1.\n98\n3\n\u0003\n0.\n84\n6\n\u0003\n7.\n67\n3*\n**\n(1\n.90\n6)\n(2\n.01\n8)\n(1\n.34\n3)\n(1\n.14\n59\n)\n(1\n.60\n4)\n\u0003\n2\nLo\ng\nLi\nke\nlih\noo\nd\n14\n.1\n2\n29\n.5\n2\n24\n.7\n4\n19\n.6\n0\n66\n.2\n9\n%\nc\no\nrr\ne\nc\ntly\npr\ned\nic\nte\nd\n99\n.2\n7\n98\n.9\n4\n98\n.8\n6\n98\n.2\n7\n97\n.3\n2\nEr\nro\nrs\n(o\nbs\nerv\ned\nY\nea\ns)\n1\n1\n1\n2\n5\nEr\nro\nrs\n(o\nbs\nerv\ned\nN\nay\ns)\n1\n3\n3\n3\n6\nN\num\nbe\nr\no\nf\nc\na\nse\ns\n27\n4\n37\n6\n35\n0\n28\n9\n41\n1\nN\not\ne:\nSt\nan\nda\nrd\ne\nrr\no\nr\nin\npa\nre\nnt\nhe\nse\ns,\n*\np\n\u0001\n0.\n10\n,*\n*\np\n\u0001\n0.\n05\n,*\n*\n*\np\n\u0001\n0.\n01\n.\nThe British Parliament of 1841\u201347 599\nparticular interest is the distinctly right of centre position of MPs from highly protectionist\ndistricts (Figure 5). From Table 2, we know that the vast majority of these MPs were also\nnon-Peelites. In contrast, MPs from protectionist-oriented and neutral districts \u2013 many of\nwhom were Peelites \u2013 tended to be positioned at the centre or slightly to the left of centre.\nFigure 6 is also a density plot of MPs\u2019 ideology, but with party groupings. We see an\nideological distinction between non-Peelites and Peelites, which undermines an interpret-\nation of the residual as measuring the ideological consistency imposed by the Conservative\nparty. Figure 6, moreover, provides an illustration of the core argument of this article. The\nConservative party was a coalition of two distinct interests-based factions. While the\nPeelites shared the general ideology of the Conservative party (represented in Figure 6 as\noverlapping ideological space with the non-Peelites), they formed a distinct (left of centre)\nsubset, which in turn was aligned with the interests of their constituents. Prior to 1846, their\nprotectionist votes conflicted with a personal ideology that coincided more with\nconstituents\u2019 interests. Meanwhile, the non-Peelite Conservatives, positioned to the right\nof centre, faced no such conflict between personal ideology and constituents\u2019 interests.\nFinally, it is worth noting a comparison between Figures 2 and 6.53 In Figure 2, ideology,\npartisanship and constituency interests are intertwined, whereas in Figure 6, the effects of\npartisanship and constituency interests on the first dimension coordinate have been\nextracted, leaving what appears to be a purer measure of MPs\u2019 ideology. Figure 6 reveals,\nmoreover, that MPs\u2019 ideology appeared to share a considerable amount of common space.\nYet, even in this common space, Peelites retained a distinct ideological identity.\nRegression Analysis of Repeal Votes\nFrom the model displayed earlier, we obtain our three key predictors of the Repeal\nlegislation \u2013 constituency interests, party and MPs\u2019 ideology. To these predictors I add the\nsecond dimension coordinate from NOMINATE, as a way to test for the robustness of the\nkey variables. Table 4 presents the results of logistic regressions for annual votes on Repeal\nleading up to and including the final vote in 1846.54 For the final Repeal vote, the model\ncorrectly predicts all but five of the votes of the Peelites, which is no small task.55 What\nis more intriguing is that MPs\u2019 ideology appears to have had little or no bearing on the\nRepeal vote, while constituency interests, party and the second dimension coordinate56 are\nall significant at 1 per cent.\n53 Figure 6 resembles more closely a traditional left\u2013right ideological continuum, while Figure 2 reflects more\nthe partisan component of the first dimension coordinate.\n54 A model that follows the Kalt and Zupan method (by including party affiliation in the first and only regression)\nobtains the same overall percentage correctly predicted as Model 4 (discussed on the author\u2019s personal website),\nand results in no errors for the observed Yeas and eight for the observed Nays. This model was, however, considered\ninappropriate for reasons discussed above.\n55 Data limitations described earlier mean that this model actually explains seventy-seven of the eighty-two\nPeelites for whom I have data (see author\u2019s personal website).\n56 At first glance, the statistical significance of the second dimension coordinate is puzzling, as it clearly lessens\nthe predictive success of the model in 1846 (the one-dimensional model misclassifies seventeen votes \u2013 with a\nPRE of 0.905 \u2013 while the two-dimensional model misclassifies twenty-two votes \u2013 with a PRE of 0.877). It is\nimportant, then, to ask whether there is a causal relationship between the apparent split between Peelites and\nnon-Peelite Conservatives on the second dimension and the split on Repeal. In a nutshell, the answer is yes, but\nthe direction of causality runs from the split on Repeal to the split on the second dimension. That is, hostility\ntowards Repeal shaped the cleavage on the second dimension, not vice versa.

From previous divisions on Repeal, we see a very dramatic shift in the role of\nMPs\u2019 ideology in 1846. From 1842 to 1845, the ideology of MPs is highly significant (at\n1 per cent in 1843\u201345 and 5 per cent in 1842), as too are all the remaining variables except\nthe second dimension coordinate. As a model, the variables explain 98\u201399 per cent of the\nRepeal votes. This suggests that the portions of the first dimension coordinate that can be\nattributed to (a) constituency interests, (b) party, and (c) MPs\u2019 ideology, all carried weight\nin the voting decisions of MPs, until the actual Repeal vote. In 1846, an abrupt change\noccurred: MPs\u2019 personal ideology appears to have had little or no influence in their\ndecision. Rather, they were motivated more by the desire to further their constituents\u2019\ninterests. Repeal appears to have gained passage as (at least some) MPs switched from\nvoting as trustees to voting as delegates.\nThe coefficient estimates from Table 4 may be used to conduct simulations that allow\nus to estimate the substantive effect of changes in key variables \u2013 particularly, constituency\ninterests and MPs\u2019 ideology \u2013 on the simulated probability of a free-trade vote. Using the\nparameters from the logistic regressions from Table 4, 1,000 simulated sets of parameters\nare generated.57 From these, two probabilities are calculated for each of the key variables,\ncreating a set of probabilities for each faction of the Conservative party. The first is the\nprobability of a vote in favour of free trade when MPs\u2019 ideology and the second dimension\ncoordinate are set to their mean values, constituency interests is set to its minimum value,\nand the party variable is set equal to Peelite. This simulates the probability of a Peelite from\na highly rural constituency (whose ideology and second dimension coordinate values are\nconsidered average) voting for free trade. The second simulates the change that results in\nthe first set of probabilities when constituency interests is changed to its maximum value.\nThis allows us to compare the probability of a free-trade vote from a Peelite representing\na rural constituency with one representing an industrial, export-oriented district (all else\nheld constant). Similarly, the probability of a free-trade vote is calculated for a Peelite\nwhose ideology falls at the extreme left of the spectrum, with the remaining variables\n(constituency interests and second dimension coordinate) set at their mean values. As with\nconstituency interests, a second probability then simulates the change that results when we\nconsider a Peelite whose ideology falls at the extreme right of the spectrum (all else held\nconstant). This same set of probabilities is replicated, but for the non-Peelite faction of the\nConservative party. For simplicity, probabilities from just the early division and the final\ndivision are considered, with the results given in Table 5.58\nFrom Table 5 we can see that, over the whole of the parliament, constituency interests\nand personal ideology weighed more heavily for Peelites than non-Peelites (as the\ndifferences in all the probabilities are greater for non-Peelites). This suggests that\nnon-Peelites were driven more by the broader Conservative ideology (which viewed\nprotection as a traditional British institution) than were Peelites, which is consistent with\nthe argument of this article. Nonetheless, constituency interests and personal ideology also\naffected the votes of non-Peelites, but more so in 1842 than in 1846. In 1842, both variables\n57 G. King, M. Tomz and J.

It seems fair to say, then, that in the final 1846 vote,\nnon-Peelites were affected in part by constituency interests but not at all by personal\nideology.\nFor Peelites, it is clear that constituency interests had a very strong effect on voting\nbehaviour for the duration of the parliament. Changing the orientation of the district from\nrural to industrial increases the probability of a Peelite voting for free trade from virtually\nzero to almost one. In contrast, the effect of ideology is very strong in 1842 (with a change\nfrom its minimum to its maximum value resulting in an increase in the probability of a\nfree-trade vote from almost zero to almost one), but weak (and statistically insignificant)\nin 1846. This provides firm evidence in support of the contention that, as the influence of\nideology dissipated in 1846, Peelites voted more as delegates.\nMPS\u2019 IDEOLOGY: SHIRKING OR REPUTATION BUILDING?\nA lively and on-going debate in the legislative studies literature contrasts \u2018bad\u2019 ideology\nwith \u2018good\u2019 ideology.59 For some, legislators who serve their own ideological preferences\ninstead of the preferences of their constituents are labelled as (bad) \u2018shirkers\u2019.60 For others,\nideology serves a (good) reputational purpose inasmuch as legislators who vote against\ntheir established (ideologically based) reputations do themselves a disservice by devaluing\nthat reputation.61 This study provides some insights into the strengths and limitations of\nboth interpretations of ideology by providing a relatively simple case with which to explore\nthe interplay between ideology and constituency interests.\nThe case of mid-nineteenth century Britain is unusual in that it is one of the few examples\nof a political environment in which a single issue is dominant. Politics in the 1840s most\ndefinitely revolved around trade policy: the election of 1841 was characterized largely as\na mandate on trade policy (with the Conservative party standing for protection); the\noverriding issue of the 1841\u201347 Parliament was the Corn Laws; and Repeal caused the\nultimate demise of the Peel government and the disintegration of the Conservative party.\nThis single-issue dominance allows us to simplify the interests of constituents according\nto their preferences on trade policy (as, for example, in Table 2). Let us further assume\nthat the trade policy preference of the median voter can be defined by an aggregate measure,\nderived from \u2018district economic orientation\u2019 (from Table 2).62\nIt is almost certain that the median voter in non-Peelite Conservative constituencies\nfavoured protection. This means that non-Peelite Conservatives were not \u2018shirkers\u2019, as they\nconsistently voted for protection throughout the parliament. However, these MPs were also\n59 Richardson and Munger, \u2018Shirking, Representation and Congressional Behavior\u2019.\n60 Peltzman, \u2018Constituent Interest and Congressional Voting\u2019; D. Nelson and E. Silberberg, \u2018Ideology and\nLegislator Shirking\u2019, Economic Inquiry, 25 (1987), 15\u201325.\n61 Dougan and Munger, \u2018The Rationality of Ideology\u2019; Richardson and Munger, \u2018Shirking, Representation and\nCongressional Behavior\u2019.\n62 This sets aside differences between the geographic constituency and the election constituency (R. F. Fenno,\nHome Style: House Members in Their Districts (Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, 1978); Uslaner, The Movers and\nthe Shirkers), as well as questions arising from the limited franchise. Aggregate measures of constituency interests\ninclude those of the disenfranchised, and if these were found to differ from those of the franchised, may introduce\na bias to the measurement of constituency interests. Such a bias is, however, unlikely as the interests of the\ndisenfranchised (which include free-trade-oriented industrial workers and protectionist-oriented rural labourers)\nmay very well simply mirror those of the franchised (namely industrial capitalists and landowners).\nThe British Parliament of 1841\u201347 603\nwedded to a Conservative ideology in which protection was considered a fundamental\nBritish institution. And, moreover, the Conservative party\u2019s reputation for defending\nprotection was critical to the 1841 election. It is, therefore, impossible to be certain about\nwhat motivated the protectionist votes of non-Peelite Conservatives, as a Conservative\nideology and constituency interests point in the same direction. Moreover, a concern for\nmaintaining their reputations as true defenders of \u2018Conservatism\u2019 may have figured in the\n1846 vote, as these MPs saw their leader and the rest of their party defect to free trade.\nIn short, these MPs may have been voting as simple delegates for the duration of the\nparliament, or may have been motivated by a broader Conservative ideology. What is very\nclear is that they were not shirking.\nThe preference of the median voter in Peelite constituencies is less certain, but in all\nlikelihood was borderline protectionist, with some leanings towards free-trade. As such,\nit is a stretch to characterize a free-trade vote in 1846 as \u2018shirking\u2019. Indeed, the notion of\nshirking is virtually meaningless in a context of a median voter who is situated very near\n(if not at) the point of indifference. But to characterize Peelite voting as reputation building\nis no more helpful, as an ideological reputation suggests constancy in voting \u2013 not an abrupt\nreversal. The most appropriate interpretation of Peelite voting behaviour (subject to the\nlimitations of econometric testing)63 is as described earlier, that before 1846, Peelites voted\naccording to a general Conservative ideology, but in 1846 their votes reflected a median\nvoter who was leaning towards free trade.\nFinally, this case points to two general limitations of both the shirking and\nreputation-building interpretations of ideology. First, neither interpretation is conducive\nto an understanding of why legislators abruptly change their votes. In the case of Repeal,\nthe source of change stemmed from the instability inherent in a Conservative party that,\nwhile sharing a general Conservative ideology, was the marriage of two distinct\ninterests-based alliances. That is, Peelite conversion to free trade came from a conflict\nbetween a Conservative ideology and constituents\u2019 interests which eventually erupted\nwhen their leader moved for Repeal. Without examining how interests intersect with\nideology it is impossible to understand an abrupt reversal such as Repeal. Hence, where\nthe task is to explain shifts in voting patterns (particularly for issues such as trade policy\nwhere interests are highly charged), a focus strictly on ideology (defined either as shirking\nor reputation-building) has severe limitations.\nSecondly, the quantity measure of shirking suggested by Kalt and Zupan \u2013 namely, the\nabsolute value of the ideology residual \u2013 can result in misleading findings where the\ndirection of interests is of fundamental importance. Comparing this measure across party\ngroups, it appears that non-Peelite Conservatives demonstrated far more shirking than\nPeelites, Whigs\/Liberals and Reformers, as we obtain measures of shirking for each party\ngroup of 0.235, 0.144, 0.141 and 0.139, respectively. This would suggest that non-Peelite\nConservatives were even more protectionist than their constituents desired, while the rest\nwere more closely aligned with the interests of their constituents. In Kalt and Zupan\u2019s view,\n63 The motivations of MPs are invariably difficult to capture from roll-call analysis. Ideally, researchers would\nuse content analysis to evaluate the written and verbal explanations given by MPs for their positions. While these\ntoo may have their own limitations, the combination of roll-call analysis and content analysis should provide a\nbetter understanding of the motivations of MPs as they face the cross-pressures of constituency interests and\nideology. Indeed, very recent content analysis of the 1841\u201347 Parliamentary Debates reveals that the arguments\nthat Peelites invoked to explain their votes did indeed change abruptly in 1846 (C. Schonhardt-Bailey,\n\u2018Conservatives Who Sounded Like Trustees But Voted Like Delegates\u2019 (unpublished, London School of\nEconomics, 2002, posted on the author\u2019s website)). The content of this change is entirely consistent with the\nargument set forth in this article.\n604 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nnon-Peelites should therefore have lost electoral support as a consequence of their shirking.\nBut, in fact, non-Peelite Conservatives were marginally more successful than Peelites in\nthe general election of 1847,64 which suggests that non-Peelites may even have gained\nsupport from maintaining their protectionist reputation. Hence, such a simple quantitative\nmeasure of shirking can, in cases where extreme views are likely to generate support,\nmislead. Thus, if we accept that non-Peelite Conservativs were shirking, the presumption\nthat shirking is an electoral liability would require reconsideration.\nCONCLUSION\nThis article has sought to answer the puzzle of the Peelites by characterizing the\nConservative party as a coalition between two interests-based alliances, with a shared\nconcern for retaining traditional British institutions. Non-Peelite Conservatives, who\nrepresented mostly agricultural districts, had no motivation to follow Prime Minister Peel\nas he moved for Repeal: both their Conservatism and representation of rural constituencies\npointed towards retaining a firm commitment to protection. Peelites, who represented\ndistricts with comparatively more free-trade leaning interests, faced a conflict between\ntheir concern for Conservatism and their representation of constituents who were either\nborderline protectionists or leaning towards free trade. Prior to 1846, they voted in\naccordance with Conservatism. But in 1846, when their leader foreclosed the option of\nretaining party unity, Peelites shifted from voting as trustees to voting more as delegates.\nMore broadly, this article has sought to develop a methodological framework for\ndisentangling the influences of constituency interests, party and personal ideology on the\nroll-call votes of legislators. It applies widely recognized (though not necessarily\nuniversally accepted) methodologies such as the NOMINATE technique and the Kalt and\nZupan residualization approach in a way that allows us to gauge the relative influences of\ninterests, party and ideology on MPs in the votes leading up to and including the final third\nreading of Repeal. Yet, as the British case and its data are obviously historical, one might\nquestion whether the analysis presented here is generalizable to other, more contemporary\nlegislative settings. Certainly, nineteenth-century British parties were less cohesive and\nconstituency interests were less complex than in contemporary Britain \u2013 but these are only\ndifferences of degree. And, certainly, the historical setting made the ideological climate\nin 1846 unique \u2013 but not so much as to prevent contemporary observers from drawing\nparallels between intra-Conservative party cleavages on Repeal with those on the European\nUnion. Moreover, this article has shown that the ideological make-up of the 1841\u201347\nParliament can be largely understood within a contemporary left\u2013right continuum. Hence,\njust as other non-American applications of the NOMINATE method have demonstrated,65\nwhile legislative settings may differ considerably, the methodologies applied to study them\nhave much in common.\nWhat remains certain is that the findings of this article call into question some of the\n64 In a cross-tabulation of party affiliation and the electoral fate of MPs in the 1847 election, 49 per cent of\nnon-Peelite Conservatives were returned to parliament (with or without a contest) while 45 per cent of Peelites\nwere similarly returned. And similarly, where a contest occurred, 67 per cent of non-Peelites won while 64 per\ncent of Peelites won.\n65 S.
