However, the narrow \nbeam dimension makes it extremely sensitive in terms of fit up tolerance. This causes problem in \nachieving high quality welds. Laser with arc hybrid process overcomes such issues. In this paper \nlongitudinal residual strains were compared for autogenous laser welding and laser\/ TIG hybrid \nprocesses. Joining efficiency which is defined by the penetration depth achieved per unit of energy \ninput was correlated with the residual strain generation. It has been shown that to achieve a specific \npenetration depth there is an optimum welding condition for each of the welding processes, which \nwill give minimum tensile residual stress generation. The results imply that for the same penetration \ndepth hybrid process resulted in approximately 50% higher tensile longitudinal compared to \nautogenous laser.  \n \n1. Introduction \nControl of residual stress and distortion is an \nimportant aspect in welding and joining \ntechnology. Large longitudinal residual \nstresses are caused by the compressive plastic \nflow that occurs in front of the weld pool \nduring the welding thermal cycle. The \ncompressive plastic flow is not balanced by \ntensile plastic flow on cooling leading to a \nlarge tensile residual stresses developing \nacross the weld zone. This tensile zone is \nbalanced by compressive stresses in the \nsurrounding parent material. Distortion is \nproportional to the area of the tensile peak1-3. \nDistortion is severe in the case of thin \ncomponents in particular since the \ncompressive stress field can easily exceed the \ncritical buckling load resulting in buckling \ndistortion, the removal of which is expensive \nand time consuming. There has been done a \nlot of work on understanding residual stresses \nand distortions in the past2, 4, 5.  The most \npopular methods of minimising welding \ndistortions are post weld rectification, design \noptimisation and in process manufacturing \nmethods. In addition to these there are some \ntechniques to mitigate distortions during \nwelding, referred to as stress engineering3, 6-11.  \nThe easiest and the most practical method of \nreducing residual stress is to use low energy \ninput welding processes such as laser welding. \nIt has been shown that laser welding can \nproduce low distortion joints compared to the \ntraditional arc based welding methods12. \nHowever, the quality of autogenous laser \nwelds is often insufficient, thus there is a \nconsiderable interest in hybrid laser \nprocesses. Laser welding can produce efficient \nwelds with a high aspect ratio due to the high \nenergy density of the laser source. However in \norder to obtain a high quality weld, which is \nless sensitive to fit-up tolerance the narrow \nweld produced by laser welding is not always \ndesired, especially in the case of thick \nsections. On the other hand the hybrid \nprocess, where the laser is combined with a \nconventional arc-based welding, offers better \nweld quality than autogenous laser welding. \nIn previous work the synergic effects between \nlaser and arc in hybrid welding were \nreported13-17. However in neither of these \nstudies laser welding was compared with \nhybrid welding for the same overall energy \ninput. In this paper the laser welding with 7 \nkW of power was evaluated against the hybrid \nwelding with the same overall power. \nFurthermore, the combination of laser and \nautogenous TIG source enabled a more direct \nstudy of heat effects on residual strain \nmagnitude and distribution profile without the \ninfluence of filler metal. The use of the fibre \nlaser in this study significantly lowered the \nsusceptibility of the laser beam to be \nabsorbed by the arc plasma.   \nThe aim of this paper was to compare \nautogenous laser welding with hybrid laser \nTIG in terms of joining efficiency and \nmagnitude of residual strain for the same \napplied energy input.  \n2. Experimental set-up \n \n2.1. Welding \nIn order to investigate the relationship \nbetween weld quality, energy input and \nresidual strain generation a series of laser and \nhybrid welds were produced. Different sets of \nwelding parameters were used to produce \nbead-on-plate welds with different aspect \nratios and bead characteristics. \nThe welding conditions can be broadly divided \ninto three groups: laser welding with 4 kW of \npower, laser welding with 7 kW of power and \nlaser plus TIG hybrid welding with 7 kW of \noverall power, which included 4 kW from laser \nand 3 kW from TIG. The latter combination of \nconditions allows a direct comparison of the \nlaser and the hybrid laser welding at the same \nenergy input. The travel speed was varied \nbetween 1-8 m\/min for each of the processes. \nAn IPG YLR-8000 CW fibre laser with a \nmaximum power of 8 kW and a fibre diameter \nof 300 \u00b5m was used as the laser source. The \nlaser beam was collimated with a 125 mm \nfocal length lens and focused using a lens with \n250 mm focal length. This optical arrangement \nresulted in a spot size of 630 \u00b5m with a top \nhat energy distribution profile. For all the \nhybrid welds a Migatronic BDH 550 TIG source \nwas used. The energy input in the TIG process \nwas calculated from the average voltage and \ncurrent, which were measured by means of \nYokogawa DL750 Scope Corder. All tests, \nincluding the hybrid trials were carried out \nwithout any filler wire. The material used for \nthe investigation was 250x50x12 mm3 S355 \nlow carbon steel. The specimens were \nclamped along the whole length and no \nbacking bar was applied. Pure shield argon \nwas used as a shielding medium.   \n2.2. Residual strain measurement  \nThe objective of this work was to correlate the \nresidual strain generation for different kind of \nwelding processes with a range of energy \ninputs. Therefore a number of samples were \nanalysed with varying energy input and \nmanufactured using laser and laser plus TIG \nhybrid process. In welding residual stresses \nand therefore strains are most significant in \nthe longitudinal direction, which is the same \nas the welding direction. In the present study \nlongitudinal strain measurement was carried \nout and compared for different welding \nprocesses, as it would give a proportional \nindication of the longitudinal stress state.  \n  \nThe neutron diffraction experiment was \ncarried out at the ENGIN-X strain scanner at \nthe spallation neutron source at ISIS, RAL, \nOxford, UK. The details of ENGIN-X could be \nfound elsewhere18, 19. In the present \nexperiment a time of flight range of 20-40 \nmsec was used which resulted into an inter-\nplanar spacing of 1.1 to 2.1 \u00c5. The {110}, {200} \nand {211} families of crystallographic planes \nwere analysed. An incoming beam dimension \nof 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm was used for the longitudinal \nstrain measurement which allowed \nmeasurement of the strain variation at an \nappropriate length scale. A 2 mm collimator \nwas used for all the measurements, which \nresulted in a cuboid gauge volume of 2\u00d72\u00d72 \nmm3. The gauge volume was focused 2 mm \nunder the surface of measured specimens.  \nRefinement of the diffraction spectrum was \nperformed using the General Structure \nAnalysis System (GSAS) programme which \ngave an average lattice parameter (a) of the \nirradiated volume20. \n3. Joining efficiency  \nThe same penetration depth in laser welding \ncan be obtained with different combinations \nof parameters, which correspond to different \nenergy input values. Furthermore, for the \nsame energy input different penetration \ndepths can be achieved, particularly in laser \nwelding where different spot sizes can be \napplied. Gao et al. showed that different \nwelds can be obtained at constant overall \nenergy input if the energy ratio of laser and \narc changes14.  \nIn order to characterise a weld in terms of \nenergy required per millimetre of depth of \nweld we use the term joining efficiency. \nJoining efficiency defines how much energy \nper unit length of a particular process was \nutilised per unit of penetration depth. Thus \nthe joining efficiency is equal to the ratio of \npenetration depth and energy input, which in \nterms of welding parameters corresponds to a \nratio of welding speed (v) and penetration \ndepth (D) to the power (P) and is given by \nequation 1.   \n]\/[ 2 kJmm\nP\nDv\nJE\n    (1) \n \nConsequently for a given penetration depth \nhigh joining efficiency corresponds to low \nenergy input and in practice should mean low \nresidual stress and distortion. The conditions \nat which the joining efficiency reaches the \nmaximum ensure welds with the highest \naspect ratios of penetration depth to width \nand with a relatively low energy input. A \ntypical plot of the joining efficiency as a \nfunction of travel speed is shown in Fig.1. It \ncan be seen that the joining efficiency initially \nincreases with the travel speed and then after \nreaching the maximum tends to decrease \nagain. This effect can be explained by the fact \nthat the weld width reduces as the energy \ninput reduces (by increase of the travel speed \nat constant power). The penetration depth \nalso slightly reduces but the rate of reduction \nof the weld width is more than the rate of \nreduction of the penetration depth. Thus as a \nnet result the aspect ratio of weld and the \njoining efficiency increase in this region. \nHowever, at a certain point the weld width \nreaches a minimum for a given material and \nany further increase of the travel speed \nreduces only the penetration depth, without \nany significant effect on the weld width. After \nthis point the aspect ratio drops and the \njoining efficiency decreases again with further \nincrease of the travel speed until a point, at \nwhich the energy input will be lower than the \nmelting threshold.  The maximum joining \nefficiency is obtained at a point where the \nheat transfer in to the bulk material (side \nloses) is minimised, but the process is \nsufficient to maintain a deep penetration \ndepth.    \n \n4. Results \nThe investigated processes were analysed in \nterms of the joining efficiency and longitudinal \nresidual strain generation. The results for the \njoining efficiency are presented in Fig.1. The \njoining efficiency of the laser welding with 4 \nkW of power and the hybrid welding with 7 \nkW of overall power (4 kW laser and 3 kW TIG) \nreached a maximum at the travel speed of \napproximately 4 m\/min whereas in the case of \nthe laser welding with 7 kW of power a \nmaximum joining efficiency was obtained at \napproximately 6 m\/min. It can be also seen in \nFig.1 that the joining efficiency of the hybrid \nprocess was much lower compared with both \nlaser processes.  \n  \nFigure 1: Joining efficiency as a function of travel speed \nfor laser welding with 7 kW of power, laser welding \nwith 4 kW of power and hybrid laser\/TIG with 7 kW of \noverall power (4 kW laser and 3 kW TIG) \n \nOn the other hand the best bead quality \ncorresponding to a low sensitivity to fit-up \ntolerance was obtained in the case of the \nhybrid process, although no filler wire was \nused. From the macrographs obtained from \nthe three processes presented in Fig.2, it can \nbe seen that although the hybrid process \nresulted in a much higher energy input \ncompared to the 4 kW autogenous laser \nprocess the penetration depths obtained for \nthe same travel speed were similar. At all \ntravel speeds the highest penetration depths \nwere obtained in the case of the 7 kW laser \nprocess.  \nThe longitudinal strains, measured 2 mm \nbelow the top surface of the autogenous laser \nwelds obtained with 7 kW of power as a \nfunction of distance from the weld centre line \nand the travel speeds are plotted in Fig.3. The \ntravel speed seems only to affect the width of \nthe longitudinal tensile strain curve with it \nreducing as the travel speed increases, \nwhereas the peak magnitude of the tensile \nstrain remains constant.  This can be also seen \nin Fig.4 where the area under the longitudinal \ntensile strain curve against the travel speed is \nplotted for all the three processes. There are \ntwo important aspects to notice in this figure. \nFirstly the area of the tensile strain reduces as \nthe travel speed increases.  Secondly the \ntensile strain of the autogenous laser welding \nwith 7 kW of power and the hybrid welding \nwith 7 kW of overall power are similar, \nwhereas in the case of the autogenous laser \nwelding with 4 kW of power the area of the \ntensile peak is much lower.  \n \n \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nLaser 7 kW\nLaser 4 kW\nHybrid 7 kW\nTravel Speed [m min\n-1\n]\nJ\no\nin\nin\ng\n E\nff\nic\nie\nn\nc\ny\n [\nm\nm\n2\n k\nJ\n-1\n]\nFigure 2: Macrographs of welds obtained at a constant travel speed of 2 m\/min; a) laser 4 kW (120 J\/mm);                            \nb) hybrid 7 kW (210 J\/mm); c) laser 7 kW (210 J\/mm) \n \n \na) b) c) \n Figure 3: Longitudinal strain profiles measured 2 mm \nbelow the top surface as a function of position across \nthe weld centre and travel speed, produced with 7 kW \nof laser power \n \nFigure 4: Area under the longitudinal tensile strain \ncurve as a function of travel speed for laser welding \nwith 4 kW of power, laser welding with 7 kW of power \nand hybrid welding with 7 kW of total power \n \nThe reason that there is a difference in the \nlongitudinal tensile strains (Fig.4) between the \nhybrid and the 7 kW laser process at high \nwelding speeds might result from \ndeterioration of the heat transfer efficiency of \nthe TIG source at high welding speeds.  It is \nworth mentioning that despite the same \npower (7 kW) being applied in both the \nautogenous and hybrid processes the \npenetration depth of the laser welding was \nalmost double that of the hybrid welding. \nThe reduction of energy input and residual \nstrain with the increase of travel speed occurs \nirrespectively of the penetration depth. \nTherefore, the results in the next part are \npresented in a way to enable a direct \ncomparison of the different welding processes \nfor the same penetration depth. In this test \nthe travel speed was varied for the different \nprocesses ( laser welding with 4 kW of power, \nlaser welding with 7 kW of power and hybrid \nwelding with 7 kW of overall power)  to obtain \nthe same penetration depth. The macrographs \npresented in Fig.5 show such a comparison for \n6 mm of penetration depth. It is worth \nnoticing that the weld obtained at 7 kW \n(Fig.5c) is narrower that the weld obtained at \n4 kW (Fig.5a). The applied energy inputs for 4 \nkW laser welding, 7 kW hybrid welding and 7 \nkW laser welding are 240 J\/mm, 420 J\/mm \nand 140 J\/mm respectively. In Fig.6 the \nlongitudinal strains of the corresponding \nspecimens are plotted.

It is \nclear that the energy input of the hybrid \nprocess exceeds that of both autogenous laser \nprocesses for the entire range of penetration \ndepths. If both autogenous laser processes are \nconsidered (4 kW laser and 7 kW laser) the \nlower energy input was applied in the case of \n7 kW laser process for the analysed 6 mm \npenetration depth. In general among all tested \nconditions the 7 kW laser process required the \nlowest energy for a particular penetration \ndepth with exception for shallow penetration \ndepth where the 4 kW laser process \napproached the 7 kW process.   \n \n5. Discussion \nLaser welding is characterised by high energy \ndensity with low energy input, which \npromotes welds with high aspect ratio and \njoining efficiency. The joining efficiency of the \nhybrid process is much lower compared to the \nautogenous laser welding, as shown in Fig.1. \nThis fact can be better understood by \nanalysing the macrographs shown in Fig.2. The \npenetration depth of the hybrid process with \n7 kW of overall power is equal to the \npenetration depth of laser welding with 4 kW \nof power. This means that the extra heat from \nthe arc source in the hybrid process did not \ncontribute to the penetration depth, but a \nlarge heat source resulting in a large weld \nwidth and melting area. The penetration \ndepth of the laser welding with 7 kW of power \nis almost double than the penetration depth \nof the hybrid welding using 7 kW of overall \npower.    \nThe residual strain analysis shows that for a \ngiven penetration depth the strain generation \nis minimised when the joining efficiency is \nmaximised. As the travel speed increases at \nconstant power the amount of heat absorbed \nin to the workpiece decreases, causing a \ndecrease of the residual tensile strain domain, \nas shown in Fig4. However, the penetration \ndepth also reduces as travel speed increases.   \nIt is more useful in terms of welding \napplications to compare different welding \nprocesses at the parameters, which are \nnecessary to obtain a particular penetration \ndepth. The macrographs presented in Fig.5 \nshow such an example.

The width of tensile strain domain \nshown in Fig.6 is the smallest in case of the \nlaser weld with 7 kW. The calculated area \nunder the tensile strain domain shows a 50% \nreduction in the area in the 7 kW autogenous \nlaser weld compared to the 7 kW hybrid weld. \nThis corresponds to a 50% reduction of the \ntensile strain in the laser welding compared to \nthe hybrid process for the same penetration \ndepth. A required energy input per unit of \npenetration depth plotted in Fig.7 clearly \nshows difference between the processes. \nSince the arc in the hybrid process did not \ncontribute to the penetration depth this \nprocess is less efficient in terms of energy per \nunit of penetration depth.  Comparing both \nlaser processes the 7 kW laser welding was \noperated in more efficient conditions than the \n4 kW laser welding. The high power in this \ncase enabled an increase in welding speed, \nresulting in a reduction of energy input and \nresidual strain as a result. The laser process \nwith 4 kW of power required a relatively low \ntravel speed in order to achieve the required 6 \nmm of penetration depth, which resulted in a \nrelatively high energy input and residual \nstrain. Only at shallow penetration depths the \njoining efficiency of the 4 kW laser process \napproached the efficiency of 7 kW laser \nprocess, because the energy inputs were \nsimilar (Fig.7).  \nIt is clear that the choice of welding \nparameters for a given penetration depth \ndepends on the application requirements. The \nhybrid process gives a wide weld with a good \nfit-up tolerance but also results in a larger \nresidual strain field that could lead to issues \nwith distortion. If the residual strain needs to \nbe minimised then a higher laser power \nshould be used.    \n \n6. Conclusions:       \nFrom the comparison of laser and laser with \nTIG hybrid welding under the conditions \nshown in this paper the following can be \nconcluded: \n If you convert a laser process into a \nhybrid process the extra energy input \nwill result in widening of the weld \nbead but the penetration depth will \nnot increase. \n This means that, the joining efficiency \ndecreases and the width of the \nlongitudinal strain profile broadens, \nwhich could lead to issues with \ndistortion. \n For a particular penetration depth the \nhybrid process in comparison to the \nlaser process will have a lower joining \nefficiency and a higher residual strain \n(equivalent to stress) and broader \nweld bead profile. \n For large penetration depths higher \nlaser powers and the travel speeds \ngive lower energy input and therefore \nlower residual strains compared to \nusing lower laser power and travel \nspeed.  \nAcknowledgement  \nCranfield IMRC (Innovative Manufacturing \nResearch Centres) grant platform supported \nby EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences \nResearch Council) and Corus Group are \nacknowledged for funding the project.  \n References:  \n1.
