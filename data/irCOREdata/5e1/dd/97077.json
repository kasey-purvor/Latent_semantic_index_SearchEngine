Introduction\nIn any cellular environment, precise execution of\nactivities depends on well-coordinated control mechan-\nisms. Feedback inhibition is one of the methods by which\nsuch control may be achieved; an enzyme which catalyses a\nprimary reaction may have this action inhibited by one of\nthe downstream products of the reaction. We propose that\nsuch a mechanism is involved in the regulation of vascular\nsprout formation during tumour-induced angiogenesis, and\ndevelop a simple mechanistic mathematical model to\ndescribe the determination of sprouting sites along an\nexisting blood vessel.\nAngiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from an\nexisting vasculature, is a critical process in the formation of\nsolid tumours. Before reaching an angiogenic stage, such\ntumours may exist for some time as dormant, avascular,\nmasses of limited size (up to approximately 2mm in\ndiameter). Growth of these masses is restricted by the need\nto obtain oxygen and nutrients by diffusion. If the\ntumorous mass switches to an angiogenic phenotype, ae front matter r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Addison-Smith).new blood vessel network is formed between the existing\nvasculature and the tumour, providing a source for oxygen\nand nutrients. Rapid growth of the tumour is consequently\nenabled. Formation of the new blood vessel network is\nguided by a complex interplay of both pro- and anti-\nangiogenic molecules produced by a variety of sources\nincluding tumour cells, endothelium, extracellular matrix,\npericytes, and plasma clotting products (see, for review,\nAraujo and McElwain, 2004; Mantzaris et al., 2004). This\npaper is concerned with the products and processes\ninvolved in the initiation of angiogenic sprouting. We\npresent a mathematical model based on the hypothesis that\nsprouting is initiated by a threshold concentration of\nangiogenic growth factor, and that antiangiogenic products\nsynthesized in the immediate vicinity of each new sprout\nwill act locally to prevent the overwhelming formation of\nnew sprouts. This feedback inhibition process is similar to\nthat described by Karihaloo et al. (2001) in which it is\nproposed that the antiangiogenic factor, endostatin, plays a\nrole in preventing unchecked outgrowth of the growing\nureteric bud.\nPrevious modelling work includes that of Orme and\nChaplain (1996), who developed a model of sprout\nformation which is based upon phenomena occurring\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u2013152within the parent vessel. They develop a three species\nmodel: endothelial cells, matrix, and adhesive sites. Using\nthis model and a stability analysis, they argue that a\nnatural spacing appears with the space between sprouts\ndetermined from these equations in a manner similar to\nTuring instabilities. They do not include any feedback\nmechanism. Levine et al. (2001) have also developed a\nmodel for the onset of capillary formation. Their model,\nbased upon the theory of reinforced random walks, uses\nthe assumption that angiogenic factor is transformed into a\nproteolytic enzyme that enables a sprout to form. Their\nmodel makes predictions about the aggregation of en-\ndothelial cells, and the perforation of the basement\nmembrane that allows the formation of a new sprout.\nAgain there is no feedback of the form discussed in our\ncurrent work.\nAn alternative approach to vascular network growth\nmodelling is adopted by Gazit (1996, Chapter 5), who uses\nnumeric simulations on a square lattice, typically\n128\u0002 128. The network is initiated with a single seed and\nthen extends in response to a diffusible growth factor\nproduced by a source outside the network. Optionally,\nlocal amplification can occur at an activated network site\nand this, in turn, produces further diffusible growth factor.\nBefore presenting the mathematical model we discuss\nantiangiogenic products which are found in the vicinity of\nthe tumour-induced angiogenesis, and which may act to\ninfluence the patterns of sprouting.\n1.1. Formation of antiangiogenic molecules during tumour-\ninduced angiogenesis\nThe search for endogenous antiangiogenic molecules\nproduced within the microenvironment of a tumour was\ninitially prompted by observations that excision of a\nprimary tumour can often lead to rapid growth of its\npreviously dormant metastases. The suppression of sec-\nondary growths was thought to be due to antiangiogenic\nfactors, produced in the environment of the main tumour,\nbut acting at the site of distant metastases to prevent these\nsmall masses of tumour attaining vascularisation.\nAlthough proangiogenic factors are also produced by the\nprimary tumour, it was suggested that the antiangiogenic\nmolecules had a longer half-life in circulation, and so\nbecame the dominant effect at the site of distant\nmetastases. Researchers have subsequently uncovered\nmany endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, including\ntumstatin, arrestin, and canstatin, and most notably,\nangiostatin and endostatin. We will discuss angiostatin\nand endostatin briefly here. For recent reviews of these and\nother antiangiogenic molecules, see Clamp and Jayson\n(2005), Folkman (2005), Ruegg et al. (2006), Sim (1998).\nEndostatin is an 18\u201322 kDa fragment of collagen XVIII,\nwhich is notably present, amongst other collagens, in the\nvascular and epithelial basement membrane (Saarela et al.,\n1998). It has been shown to inhibit tumour-induced\nangiogenesis, and to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) prolifera-tion and migration, with the possible mechanism being\ndisruption of cell\u2013matrix interactions. Cleavage of endo-\nstatin from collagen XVIII is mediated by some of the\nmatrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (Heljasvaara et al., 2005),\nand, at low pH, by the protease, cathepsin L, independent\nof MMP activity (Felbor et al., 2000). Production of\nproteases such as cathepsin L and MMPs involved in the\nproduction of endostatin are known to be upregulated in\nthe vicinity of tumour-induced angiogenesis (see, for\ninstance, Taraboletti et al., 2002; Felbor et al., 2000; Jones\net al., 1999). Additionally, it has been hypothesized that\nendostatin plays a role in preventing unchecked outgrowth\nof the developing ureteric bud. Karihaloo et al. (2001)\nproposed that MMPs degraded the basement membrane at\nthe tip of the growing ureteric bud, resulting in an\naccumulation of endostatin which then acted to inhibit\nfurther branching. Felbor et al. (2000) also suggest that\nendostatin acts in a feedback mechanism during angiogen-\nesis. We hypothesize that such a mechanism contributes to\nthe prevention of unchecked sprouting from existing blood\nvessels during tumour-induced angiogenesis.\nOther possible candidates for a feedback control\nmechanism of angiogenic sprouting include the molecule\nangiostatin. Angiostatin is a 38 kDa protein, cleaved from\nthe serum protein plasminogen by the action of such\nfactors as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and several of\nthe matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (Jurasz et al., 2003).\nIt has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) growth.\nDuring tumour-induced angiogenesis, growth factors\nsecreted by the tumour initially cause hyperpermeability\nin nearby blood vessels (Dvorak, 2003). This occurs before\nspouting is initiated, before breakdown of the basement\nmembrane, and results in leakage of the blood plasma into\nthe surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). This plasma\ncontains both plasminogen, from which angiostatin is\nderived, and the factors which cleave plasminogen to form\nangiostatin, such as tissue plasminogen activator and\nMMPs. Tissue plasminogen activator and the MMPs\nmay also be present in the ECM during angiogenesis\nthrough production by endothelial cells, or may be released\nby tumour cells. Thus angiostatin may be formed in the\nvicinity of blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis.\nSections 2 and 3 of this paper develop the mathematical\nmodel, Sections 4 and 5 present an analysis of the model\nwith and without activator decay, results are discussed in\nSection 6, and Section 7 discusses conclusions and\ndirections for future research.\n2. Model domain\nThe domain of the mathematical model, shown in Fig. 1,\nis based on the physical set up of an experimental\nangiogenesis model known as the corneal pocket assay\n(see, for example, Gimbrone et al., 1974; Asahara et al.,\n1998). In these experiments a tumour fragment, or a pellet\nimpregnated with a growth factor, such as vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF), is implanted into\nARTICLE IN PRESS\ntumour or pellet\nlimbal blood vessel\nL ra\nr\nsite of first sprout\nactivator source\nFig. 1.

The implant engenders an angiogenic response in\nnearby blood vessels\u2014those in the limbus (periphery of the\ncornea) closest to the pocket. The progression of the\nangiogenic response through the normally avascular and\nsemi-transparent cornea is relatively easy to inspect. Fig. 2\nreproduces images from Asahara et al. (1998) showing\nangiogenic response in a mouse cornea 6 days after\nimplantation with a pellet containing VEGF.\nObservations of angiogenesis relevant to this paper from\nsuch assays can be summarized as follows: within a few\nhours of implantation, the nearby limbal blood vessels\nbecome hyperpermeable, and plasma leaks from the vessels\ninto the surrounding stroma; endothelial cells that line the\nvessels produce enzymes which degrade the surrounding\nbasement membrane; the cells begin to migrate through the\ngaps in the basement membrane, moving towards thesource of angiogenic factor. Endothelial cell division is also\nupregulated.\nEvents such as endothelial cell migration and division\nare outside the scope of the investigation of the present\npaper as are further events such as tubular morphogenesis\n(ECs roll up and join together to form tubes) and\nanastomosis (tubes connect to form loops capable of\ncirculating blood).\n3. Model development\nThe tumour implant or pellet used in the corneal pocket\nassay is represented in our mathematical model by a point\nsource, located a distance from the limbus corresponding\nto the centre of the implant (see Fig. 1). The limbus is\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u2013154modelled as a straight line. Fig. 1 shows the coordinate\nreference system used, noting that the mathematical model\nis developed here in cylindrical coordinates. The model\nincorporates two species: an angiogenesis activator (con-\ncentration denoted by A), such as VEGF, which is\nproduced continuously by the tumour, and an angiogenesis\ninhibitor (concentration denoted by I), such as endostatin\nor angiostatin, which it is assumed is produced instanta-\nneously at the initiation point of each new sprout. The\nspecies do not interact. This modelling allows for first-\norder removal of the angiogenic activator from the system,\nrepresenting either a natural decay process or other\nremoval which can be represented by a first-order decay.\nFor the purposes of this preliminary model, we assume that\nconsumption or decay of the inhibitor is negligible,\nan assumption supported by observations, discussed is\nSection 1.1, of the apparent long-range effects of anti-\nangiogenic factors on distant metastases. Sprouts may\nform at any point on the existing limbal blood vessel\nsubject to the following criteria:\u0003 the activator concentration at that point must be greater\nthan or equal to a chosen trigger value, i.e. AXAtrig;\u0003 the inhibitor concentration at that point must be less\nthan or equal to a chosen inhibitor threshold, i.e.\nIpI thresh.\nThe modelling begins as activator is released from the\ntumour into an empty domain. The first sprout occurs on\nthe blood vessel at a point closest to the activator source,\nhenceforth called the midpoint, and a \u2018puff\u2019 (instantaneous\npoint source) of inhibitor is initiated. Subsequent sprouts\noccur symmetrically about the line connecting tumour and\nblood vessel, each new sprout adding an instantaneous\npoint source of inhibitor.\n3.1. Governing equations for inhibitor and activator\nFor the angiogenic factor, A, the governing equation is\nassumed to be\nqA\nqt\n\u00bc Dar2A \u0004 laA, (1)\nwhere Da is the diffusion coefficient, and la the decay\ncoefficient, both taken as constant. Modelling the tumour\nas a continuous point source, we seek a solution of this\nequation in two dimensions in cylindrical coordinates, with\nradial symmetry. That is, we wish to solve Eq. (1) in an\ninfinite 2D domain subject to the initial condition\nA\u00f0ra; 0\u00de \u00bc 0:0, where ra is radial distance from the source,\nof strength q.

(4)\nWhen decay is significant (laa0), numeric integration\nmust be used to evaluate expression (2).\nConsidering the system with activator decay, an expres-\nsion for the activator steady state may be found in the form\nof a modified Bessel function of the second kind, namely,\nA\u00f0ra\u00de \u00bc\nq\n2pDa\nK0 ra\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nla\nDa\ns !\n.

Similarly, the scaling factor for I\nrepresents an average concentration of the amount of\ninhibitor released by one sprout, spread over a circular area\nof radius L.\nt, the non-dimensionalisation for time, has been chosen\nfor convenience, but corresponds with the definition of\nroot mean squared length of diffusion in two dimensions,\n4Dt (given in Segel, 1980): thus L2 would be the root mean\nsquared distance a particle diffuses over time t, in a two-\ndimensional system.\nApplying these transformations, the non-dimensiona-\nlised expressions for activator and inhibitor may be\nrewritten as\nA\u0005\u00f0r\u0005a; t\u0005\u00de \u00bc\nZ t\u0005\n0\n1\nu\nexp\n\u0004r\u0005a2\nu\n\u0004 gu\n\u0002 \u0003\ndu (8)\nand\nI\u0005\u00f0r\u0005; t\u0005\u00de \u00bc\nXNs\nn\u00bc1\n1\n\u00f0t\u0005 \u0004 t\u0005n\u00de\nb exp \u0004 \u00f0r\n\u0005 \u0004 r\u0005n\u00de2\nt\u0005 \u0004 t\u0005n\nb\n\u0002 \u0003\nH\u00f0t\u0005 \u0004 t\u0005n\u00de,\n(9)\nwhere b \u00bc Da=Di is the ratio of diffusion coefficients, and\ng \u00bc lat. Scaling the activator and inhibitor values by their\nrespective non-dimensionalised source strengths reduces\nthe number of parameter estimations required for the\nmodel. Continuing with the nondimensionalisation, ex-\npression (3) for activator concentration under conditions of\nno decay, may be rewritten as\nA\u0005\u00f0r\u0005a; t\u0005\u00de \u00bc E1\nr\u0005a\n2\nt\u0005\n\u0002 \u0003\n. (10)\nThe non-dimensionalised expression for the activator\nsteady state (with decay) may be written as\nA\u0005\u00f0r\u0005a\u00de \u00bc 2K0\u00f0r\u0005a\nffiffiffiffiffi\n4g\np\n\u00de. (11)\nNote that r\u0005 is measured from the position of the first\nsprout, r\u0005a is measured from the tumour, and they are\nrelated in the non-dimensional system by r\u0005a\n2 \u00bc 1\u00fe r\u00052. For\nthe remainder of the paper, star notation will be dropped,\nand distances will be expressed as a function of r, the non-\ndimensionalised (linear) distance along the blood vessel\nfrom the position of the first sprout or midpoint.3.3. Parameter values\nValues or estimates are required for the parameters b, g,\nfor the (scaled) trigger levels of both activator and\ninhibitor, and for values of L and Da, used in the non-\ndimensionalisation. For the purposes of this paper we\nchose L \u00bc 2mm, which is consistent with the experiment\ndescribed in Section 2.\n3.3.1. Ratio of diffusion coefficients, b\nFinding an accurate estimate for the ratio of diffusion\ncoefficients is somewhat difficult. An initial estimate can be\nmade based on the molecular weights of the species\ninvolved. Use of the Einstein\u2013Stokes formula (Shaw and\nWilliams, 2003) for calculating diffusivity of a molecule in\nsolution would lead to the ratio of diffusion coefficients of\nthe two molecules being inversely proportional to the ratio\nof their hydrodynamic radii. We assume that the hydro-\ndynamic radius is approximately proportional to the cube-\nroot of the molecular weight (m). The ratio of the diffusion\ncoefficients of inhibitor to activator is then proportional toffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nma=mi\n3\np\n. Endostatin has a molecular weight of around\n22 kDa, tumstatin 28 kDa, and angiostatin 57 kDa.\nAlthough VEGF has several different isoforms, the most\ncommonly found active forms have molecular weights\nranging from 34 to 45 kDa (Dvorak, 2002). Using these\nmolecular weights would suggest b values ranging from 0.5\nto 1.2, approximately. Many other factors could impact the\nratio of diffusion coefficients, and for these reasons a range\nof values for b has been investigated. As well as finding the\nratio of diffusion coefficients, we require an estimate for\nthe diffusion coefficient of the activator, Da, in order to\nestimate the characteristic time, t. We have used a value of\n0:864mm2=day (10\u00047 cm2=s) for Da based on the figure\ncalculated by Ambrosi et al. (2005) using the Einstein\u2013\nStokes formula. Although Mac Gabhann and Popel (2005)\nuse a slightly higher value in their paper, our predictions\nare not sensitive to the choice of this parameter.\n3.3.2. Activator decay rate, g\nAn initial analysis of the model is made without decay of\nthe activator (g \u00bc 0), and this yields some interesting\nresults. In this version of the model, however, the activator\nlevel at the midpoint shows monotonic increasing beha-\nviour for all time. Thus any chosen activator level will\neventually be met, and hence the model without decay\ncannot predict a physical limit to the distance between\ntumour and limbus for initiation of sprouting, although\nsuch a limit is a notable feature of corneal pocket\nangiogenesis experiments. This point is well illustrated in\nthe paper by Folkman and Klagsbrun (1975) which\nexamines the angiogenic and immune system responses to\nthe implantation of a fragment of Brown\u2013Pierce carcinoma\nin the cornea of a rabbit. Diagrams from the publication,\nwhich are reproduced in Fig. 3, show growth and\nregression of both tumour and neovasculature in an animal\nnot previously immunized against this carcinoma. We use\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 3. Sequence of vascularisation of a tumour implanted into a rabbit\ncornea. Due to the immune system response to the tumor, two separate\nstages of vascularisation occur, shown in (B) and (D), both restricted to an\narea of the limbus closest to the tumour mass. Regression of the tumour\nshown in stages (C) and (E) is caused, in this case, by the immune system,\nand is not relevant to this study, but is included for completeness.\nReprinted from Folkman (1974) with permission from Elsevier.\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u2013156this experiment as a reference, not for the immune system\nresponse, but because during the process, formation of an\nangiogenic network occurred twice. In either case angio-\ngenesis was restricted to an area of the limbus closest to the\ncurrent tumour mass, and most importantly, Folkman and\nKlagsbrun report that angiogenesis did not occur at any\nstage of the experiment until an edge of the tumour had\ngrown to within 2mm of the limbus.\nRestriction of angiogenesis to a portion of the limbus\nmay be modelled by the inclusion of activator decay. In this\nmodel the concentration of the activator protein will reach\na steady state value throughout the domain. If this value is\nlower than the activation level at all points along thelimbus, sprouting will not occur at all, a point to which we\nwill return later.\nIt is likely, therefore, that activator decay plays an\nimportant role in determining the patterns of angiogenic\nsprouting. An estimate for the value of the decay\ncoefficient, la, has been calculated from an in vitro half-\nlife of VEGF, found by Serini et al. (2003) to be 64\u0006 7min.\nBehaviour of the model for a range of decay rates around\nthis value has been investigated and is discussed in Section\n5. Fig. 4 shows that activator levels are closely coupled to\nthe decay rate: halving or doubling the decay rate changes\nactivator levels along the limbus by more than an order of\nmagnitude.\n3.3.3. Activator trigger level\nAs discussed previously, angiogenic sprouting does not\nspread around the entire limbus, but is confined to an area\nof the limbus on either side of the site of the first sprout.\nThe steady-state level of activator at the outermost sprout\nmay therefore be taken to be the lowest level of activator\nfor which spouting may occur, and this may be used as the\nactivator trigger level. Fig. 4 may be used to find the\nappropriate activator trigger level for each of the given\ndecay rates, having chosen a limit for sprouting. This\nmethod of choosing the activator trigger level does not\nwork when the model is considered without decay (there is\nno activator steady state). In this case an estimate for the\nactivator trigger level may be made using experimental\ndata on time until appearance of the first sprout. By the\ntime the sprout is visible, the activator level at the midpoint\nshould have passed the trigger level (due to a lag between\nreaching the trigger level and a sprout becoming visible),\nand an estimate for the trigger level may be made.\nHowever, having estimated the time of emergence of the\nfirst sprout, calculations of subsequent patterns of sprout-\ning may be made without finding the activator trigger level,\nusing Eq. (13).\n3.3.4. Inhibitor threshold\nValues for the inhibitor threshold level may be chosen to\ngive different regimes of sprouting along the limbus, and a\nnumber of these are discussed in the results section.\n4. Analysis of model with no decay\n4.1. Simplification of sprouting conditions\nNeglecting decay of the activator enables an interesting\npreliminary analysis of the model. The analysis is greatly\nsimplified by firstly showing that sprouts only form at\npoints where concentrations of both activator and inhibitor\nare equal to their respective trigger levels, i.e. that the\ninequalities of the conditions for sprouting may be changed\nto equalities.\nClearly the first sprout forms as soon as A \u00bc Atrig at\nr \u00bc 0. By symmetry, the second and subsequent sprouts\nwill occur in pairs, equally spaced about the midpoint of\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 4. Steady state non-dimensionalised activator levels (log scale) vs non-dimensionalised distance along limbus, r, for three different decay rates, gs\n(light line), gs=2 (dotted line), and 2gs (heavy line), where gs is the non-dimensionalised version of the decay rate given in Serini et al. (2003). The dashed\nvertical line may be used to find steady state values at a distance along the limbus equal to 0:6 of the distance from tumour to limbus. Note that changing\nthe decay rate by a factor of two changes activator levels at any point on the limbus by more than an order of magnitude. As discussed in Section 3.3.3, this\nhas a large impact on the chosen activator trigger level.\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u201315 7the domain. Therefore, for convenience, discussion will be\nfocussed on events in the right (positive r) half of the\ndomain unless otherwise noted. The second sprout will\nform at the first point on the limbus to satisfy both AXAtrig\nand IpI thresh, and we show graphically that this occurs\nwhen both A \u00bc Atrig and I \u00bc I thresh. In Fig. 5, we have\nt^ \u00bc t \u0004 t1 as the ordinate and r as the abscicca. The area for\nwhich \u00f0r; t^\u00de satisfies AXAtrig is hatched, and the area for\nwhich \u00f0r; t^\u00de satisfies IpI thresh, is shaded. Each of these areas\nis bounded by a line showing the appropriate contour, A \u00bc\nAtrig and I \u00bc I thresh. For sprouting we require the minimum\nordinate (t^) value for which the hatched and shaded areas\noverlap, and this clearly occurs where the contour lines\nintersect, that is where A \u00bc Atrig and I \u00bc I thresh.\nThis finding may be extended to the position of the third\nand further sprouts, and to the model with activator decay\nincluded.\nOnce this property of the system is established, the\nactivator constraint for sprouting under conditions without\ndecay may be rewritten as follows:\nE1\nr2a\nt\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00bc Atrig. (12)\nSince E1\u00f0x\u00de is a single-valued function for positive reals, all\nsolutions for which A \u00bc Atrig correspond to the same value\nof r2a=t. This value may be found using the time of\nemergence of the first sprout (t1), since it occurs at a known\nlocation (the midpoint), where ra \u00bc 1. Thus, the activatorcondition may be further simplified to\nr2a\ntn\n\u00bc 1\nt1\n. (13)\n4.2. Second and further sprouts, no decay\nThe position and time of formation of the second sprout\nmay be found analytically since at this stage there is only\none source of inhibitor (the first sprout), so the inhibitor\ncondition for sprouting reduces to\nI thresh \u00bc\nb\nt^2\nexp \u0004 r\n2\n2\nt^2\nb\n\u0002 \u0003\n, (14)\nwhere t^2 \u00bc t2 \u0004 t1. Recalling that r2a \u00bc 1\u00fe r2, Eq. (13) may\nbe manipulated to give r22=t^2 \u00bc 1=t1, and this may be\nsubstituted into Eq. (14).

Further sprouts will occur along\ncurves of constant 1=t1, but the inhibitor contours will\nchange on addition of each new sprout. Solutions for\nfurther pairs of sprouts are found numerically.\n5. Analysis of the model with activator decay\nAs discussed in Section 3.3.2, it is likely that decay of the\nactivator plays a significant role in determining the patterns\nof angiogenic sprouting. The decay rate reported by Serini\net al. (2003) is large enough to make a significant difference\nto our analysis. With g40, the expression for activator\nconcentration, Eq. (8) has no closed form solution. Thus\nthe En function solution and the finding that sprouts will\noccur along curves of constant r2a=t are both invalid for the\nmodel in this form. However, once the time for emergence\nof the first sprout, t1, is found, the ratio r\n2\na;n=tn for each\nfurther sprout will always be less than 1=t1, where ra;n is the\ndistance from the tumour to the point of emergence of\nsprout n. This relation may be used to calculate the\nminimum time to sprouting at any point on the limbus.\n5.1. Activator concentration\nAlthough a closed form solution for the integral in\nEq. (8) has not been found, we can find the exact solution\nto the integral for one, quite useful, value of t. This solution\ncomes from an interesting property of the integral which\nmay be demonstrated as follows: using the substitution\nw \u00bc r2a=gu and dropping star notation, we may transform\nEq. (8) to obtainZ 1\nr2a=gt\n1\nw\nexp \u0004 r\n2\na\nw\n\u0004 gw\n\u0002 \u0003\ndw.\nSince choice of the integration variable, w, is arbitrary, we\nmay replace it with u, and writeZ t\n0\n1\nu\nexp \u0004 r\n2\na\nu\n\u0004 gu\n\u0002 \u0003\ndu \u00bc\nZ 1\nr2a=gt\n1\nu\nexp \u0004 r\n2\na\nu\n\u0004 gu\n\u0002 \u0003\ndu.\n(16)\nThus the amount of activator at any location, ra, at a given\ntime, t, is equal to the amount of activator which will\naccumulate at that location between time r2a=gt and u \u00bc 1,\nthe steady state. It follows that at any location, ra, at time\nt \u00bc ra= ffiffigp ,Z ra= ffiffigp\n0\n1\nu\nexp \u0004 r\n2\na\nu\n\u0004 gu\n\u0002 \u0003\ndu \u00bc\nZ 1\nra=\nffiffi\ng\np\n1\nu\nexp \u0004 r\n2\na\nu\n\u0004 gu\n\u0002 \u0003\ndu,\nand so the level of activator will have reached half\nof its steady-state value. Our steady-state value is in the\nform of a modified Bessel function (see Eq. (11)),\nso we obtain the following exact relation for activatorlevel at t \u00bc ra= ffiffigp ,\nA ra; t \u00bc\nraffiffi\ng\np\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00bc K0\u00f0ra\nffiffiffiffiffi\n4g\np\n\u00de. (17)\nIt also follows from relation (16) that an approximation (or\nvalue for) the integral at any time, t, will also yield an\napproximation or value for the integral at time r2a=gt, which\nmay be expressed as follows:\nA\u00f0ra; t\u00de \u00bc A\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de \u0004 A ra;\nr2a\ngt\n\u0002 \u0003\n, (18)\nwhere A\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de is the steady-state value for the activator at ra.\nWe have found the following relationships to be useful\napproximations to the activator concentrations for our\nparameter space, and leave discussion of the derivation of\nthese ans\u20acatze to the Appendix.\nFor t4ra=\nffiffi\ng\np\n, we use\nA\u00f0ra; t\u00de \u00bc A\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de\n1\n1\u00fe e\u00042z\n\u0002 \u0003\n, (19)\nwhere z \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffig ffiffigp =rap \u00f0t \u0004 ra= ffiffigp \u00de.\nFor tora= ffiffigp , we apply Relation (18) to Eq.

Results\nThe model both with, and without, decay is able to\npredict a variety of sprout formation patterns. However,\nsince it is clear that decay of the activator plays an\nimportant role in restricting the extent of sprouting,\ndiscussion of results will focus on the model with decay.\nFigs. 7 and 8 illustrate typical sprout positions part-way\nthrough both a solution to the model with activator decay,\nand a solution to the model without decay. The value\nof t1, the time of the first sprout, is the same for both\nsimulations. The shaded area shows positions that satisfy\nboth activator and inhibitor conditions for sprouting, with\nthe contribution to local inhibition from the most recent\nsprouts showing as circular indentations in the contour\n(more obvious in Fig. 7). We include animations of these\nfigures over time as supplementary material.\n6.1. Variation of parameters, model with activator decay\nDifferent sprouting patterns may be obtained by\nvariation of the model parameters. The condition for no\nsprouting at all to occur is achieved simply by setting the\nactivator trigger level to a value less than the activator\nsteady state value at the midpoint. With the activator\ntrigger level set above this value, the model will always give\na first sprout at the midpoint. Depending on other\nparameter values, the next sprout may occur anywhere\nfrom very close to the midpoint to a point very close to the\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 8. Model without activator decay (Eqs.

Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u20131510limit of sprouting. Fig. 9 shows sprouting positions for\nvarious sets of parameter values. In general, away from the\nlimit of sprouting, the effect of increasing parameters is to\ndecrease the inter-sprout spacing. The exception to this is\nthe ratio of diffusion coefficients, b. As b increases from\nvery small values to values greater than 1, the distance\nbetween sprouts increases, reaches a maximum, then\ndecreases, even for sprouts close to the midpoint. However,\nwe estimate that the ratio of diffusion coefficients will be of\nthe order of unity, around which point the general trend is\nfor decreasing inter-sprout distance with increasing b. Sinceinhibitor levels must be below the threshold for sprouting\nto occur, increasing the inhibitor threshold relaxes the\ncondition on sprouting, and sprouts will form closer\ntogether. Increasing the decay rate whilst keeping the same\nlimit of sprouting effectively decreases the required trigger\nlevel for sprouting, also making it easier for sprouts to\noccur, and hence sprouts form closer together as the decay\nrate increases. Increasing the limit of sprouting also directly\ndecreases the activator trigger level, and, once again,\nsprouts will occur closer together as the limit of sprouting\nis increased.\nIn Fig. 9(d) clustering of sprouts at the limit of the\ndomain, and occasionally near the midpoint, may be\nobserved. Reasons for this and applicability of the model\nto small intersprout spacings is discussed in the following\nsection.\n6.2. Long term behaviour of the model\nIn this section we consider the long term distributions of\nactivator and inhibitor. We note that the initiation of\nsprouts during more advanced angiogenesis falls well\noutside the scope of our model, since molecular and\ncellular events, including changes in the parent vessel and\nin the extracellular matrix, would introduce many new\nconsiderations. It may be that in fact, by the time the later\nsprouts are initiated, the capillaries generated from the\nearly sprouts would have already reached the tumour, and\nthe dynamics of angiogenic factor production would be\naffected. Our model would not be valid in that regime.\nOur first note on the long term behaviour of the model\nconcerns inhibitor levels in the middle of the domain.\nInhibitor is produced in a discrete amount at each\nsprouting point, and is subject to diffusion over an infinite\nplane, so the contribution to inhibitor level from a single\nsource will tend to zero. Sprouting begins at the midpoint\nand progresses outwards symmetrically. Inhibitor is\nproduced from all sprouts, but with increasing time, the\ninhibitor concentration falls in the middle of the domain.\nIn contrast to this, the activator concentration always\nincreases, and consequently, there exists a t such that\nAXAtrig and IpI thresh again in the middle of the domain.\nThe trend may be observed in the animations we include as\nadditional material.\nTo avoid this problem in generating the current results,\nwe have demanded that no new sprouts form between\nexisting sprouts. Early on in the process, this condition is\nnot required, since the inhibitor levels stay above the\nthreshold for the parameter values chosen. We refrain from\npredicting when sprouts would form between existing\nsprouts since this is outside the framework of our current\nmodelling.\nOur second comment concerns imposing a lower limit to\nthe intersprout spacing. In its current form the model has\nno restrictions on the spacing of sprouts, treating the\nlimbal blood vessels as a single continuous entity. How-\never, since blood vessels are composed of cells which will\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 9. Model with activator decay (Eqs. (8) and (9)). Variation of sprouting positions with model parameters.

This\nparticularly applies when determining the position and\ntime of the outermost pair of sprouts. Without applying\nthis caveat, sprouting would continue indefinitely just short\nof the limit of sprouting. Once this condition is applied,\nsprouts may still cluster slightly at the limit of sprouting\nunder some, but not all, parameter sets. (For example,\nthere is clustering in Fig. 9(d), but not in Fig. 9(b) for low\nvalues of I thresh).\nWe conclude this section with a discussion of the\nmathematics behind sprout spacings at the limit of\nsprouting in the absence of an imposed restriction to theintersprout spacing. For this it may be best to consider the\nprogress of the activator trigger level contour along the\nblood vessel. Sprouts must occur at points where\nthis contour intersects the blood vessel, and the slower\nthe contour moves, the closer the sprouts will be spaced\ntogether (the inhibitor has time to diffuse away). In the\nAppendix we derive an expression to approximate the\nspeed of the activator trigger level contour at the limbus as\nit approaches the limit of sprouting, finding that the speed\nof this contour is proportional to its distance from the limit\nof sprouting. Therefore, very close to the limit of sprouting,\nthe speed of the contour along the blood vessel can become\nvery slow indeed. Inhibitor produced by sprouts in this\narea always has sufficient time to diffuse away before the\nactivator trigger level contour has moved far, giving rise to\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u20131512very closely spaced sprouts. According to this relationship\n(Eq. (A.7)), the activator trigger level contour would take\ninfinite time to reach the limit of sprouting, and so sprouts\nwill keep forming. This effect can also tend to decrease the\ninter-sprout spacing in the approach to the limit of\nsprouting, although this depends on other parameters\nand in particular on the number of sprouts already formed\nand hence the amount of inhibitor present.\n7. Conclusions and directions for future research\nWe have shown that a simple mechanistic mathematical\nmodel with two, non-interacting, species can predict a\nvariety of sprout initiation patterns. The model is able to\nshow conditions under which no sprouting will occur (see\nSection 6.1), a notable feature of the experiments by\nFolkman and Klagsbrun (1975). Results may be used to\nprovide initial capillary positions for more extensive\nmodels of angiogenesis, including those with a stochastic\nbasis.\nWe conclude this section with a discussion of directions\nwhich may be taken to refine the model.\nWe have attempted to relate the spacings in the model to\nexperimental data on spacings, but we have been unable to\nfind directly relevant investigations. One testable prediction\nof this model is that if the tumour is close to the limbal\nvessel, then the sprouts will be spaced closer together. In\naddition, the model predicts that, if the limit of limbal\nsprouting was defined by a given activator concentration,\nthen the closer the tumour is to the limbal vessel, the larger\nthe sprouting region.\nOne of the most notable features of tumour-induced\nangiogenic sprouting is the formation of a dense region of\nnew capillaries close to the tumour, known as the brush\nborder. Anderson and Chaplain (1998) have developed a\nmodel for the generation of new sprouts in the brush\nborder region, relating this to the age of the current sprout,\nthe existence of sufficient space locally for a sprout to form,\nand a requirement that the endothelial sprout density is\ngreater than a threshold level that is inversely proportional\nto the local attractant concentration. We note that such a\nbrush border effect could be predicted with the present\nmodel naturally if the quantity of inhibitor produced by\nformation of new sprouts in this area were less than the\nquantity of inhibitor produced on formation of sprouts\nfrom the limbal vessels. For example, sprouts in this area\nwould be forming on other, relatively newly formed blood\nvessels, rather than on the mature vessels of the limbus.\nPerhaps less basement membrane will have formed around\nthese immature blood vessels, leading to a lower produc-\ntion of endostatin on sprouting. It is also possible that\nlower densities of plasma clotting products occur around\nthe newer vessels (particularly since the flow of blood in\nthese vessels can be very low), and consequently a\nreduction in plasminogen production could feasibly occur.\nProposing specific mechanisms for a reduction in inhibitor\nproducts in the area of the brush border is highlyspeculative, particularly since we do not necessarily\nattribute inhibition of sprouting to any single product,\nhowever the possibility of such occurrences is not\nunreasonable.\nWe have greatly simplified the biology that is involved in\nthe initiation of angiogenesis, and mention here a few of\nthe processes that bear consideration for inclusion in the\nmathematical model. One such process is the removal of\nactivator and inhibitor proteins by the existing vasculature.\nBoth angiogenic and antiangiogenic products have been\nisolated from the circulation, and so it may be necessary to\nincorporate a sink for either or both species at the limbus.\nIt is also worth considering whether uptake of these\nproteins by the endothelial cells themselves could be\nincluded in the mathematical model.\nAnother biological consideration is that of the involve-\nment of receptor proteins in the cellular response to\nangiogenic events. It may be too simplistic to argue that\nactivation of angiogenesis is linked to the local concentra-\ntion of a protein. Perhaps the accumulation of a number of\nbound receptors acts as the trigger, and this may not\ncorrespond to the local concentration of the activator. The\nconsideration of receptor binding opens a very large area\nfor modelling including the examination of such processes\nas the upregulation of receptor expression by activated\ncells, internalization of bound receptors, and receptor\nkinetics.\nIt has been shown that VEGF accumulates in the tissue\nsurrounding solid tumours, and such accumulation would\naffect the nature of our diffusion term. Leakage of plasma\nat the site of new capillary sprouts may also affect diffusion\nof proteins, and the clotting itself may act as a source for a\nnon-diffusing type of local inhibition. All of these factors\nbear consideration for inclusion in the model.\nMathematically, modifications could include replace-\nment of such physical impossibilities as the instantaneous\npoint source, with, for example, a distributed, time\ndependent version. It would also be of interest to model\na time-delay between activation of the endothelial cells and\nrelease of inhibitor proteins.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out at Queensland University of\nTechnology during a visit by PKM funded under the\nVisiting Fellowship Scheme.

Derivation of hyperbolic tangent ansa\u00a8tze\nTo perform a mathematical analysis on the model with\nactivator decay included, we considered a variety of\nstandard techniques to approximate the integral in\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nB. Addison-Smith et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 250 (2008) 1\u201315 13Eq. (8). The most elegant approximation, a hyperbolic\ntangent function, was suggested by the shape of the\nrelation between activator concentration and time, plotted\nfrom quadrature results. A sample of these is shown in\nFig. A.1. We use the following form for the hyperbolic\ntangent approximation,\nA\u00f0ra; t\u00de \u00bc 0:5\u00bd1\u00fe tanhfm\u00f0t \u0004 n\u00deg\u0007A\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de. (A.1)\nIn this form, the activator concentration at ra reaches half\nof its steady-state value at time t \u00bc n, and at this point,\nqA=qt \u00bc 0:5mA\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de. From the results in Section 5.1, we\nknow that the activator concentration at any point,\nra, always reaches half of its steady state value at\ntime t \u00bc ra= ffiffigp . We also know that, at t \u00bc ra= ffiffigp ,\nqA=qt \u00bc ffiffigp =ra exp\u00f0\u00042ra ffiffigp \u00de. This gives us n \u00bc ra= ffiffigp ,\nand m \u00bc 2 ffiffigp exp\u00f0\u00042ra ffiffigp \u00de=A\u00af\u00f0ra\u00dera. To simplify the value\nfor m we use the following approximation to the modified\nBessel function:\nK0\u00f0x\u00de \b\nexp\u00f0\u0004x\u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00f02=p\u00dex\np ,\nfor large x. This gives an approximation to the steady state\nvalue of\nA\u00af\u00f0ra\u00de \u00bc\nexp\u00f0\u00042ra ffiffigp \u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nra\nffiffi\ng\np\n=p\np . (A.2)\nSubstituting back into the expression for m we get\nm \u00bc 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffig ffiffigp =rapp , however we have found that this fits lessFig. A.1.

Progress of activator trigger level contour along blood\nvessel\nTo develop an expression for the speed of progress of\nthe activator trigger level along the blood vessel we use the\napproximation, Eq. (19), and the approximation to the\nsteady state given by Eq. (A.2). We use Eq. (19), which\napplies to the upper portion of the integral, since we\nare particularly interested in behaviour as the contour\napproaches the limit of sprouting, noting that this limits\nthe following discussion to t4ra=\nffiffi\ng\np\n.ctivator concentration vs time at r \u00bc 0:0 (lower).

Also, since\n\u00f0ralim \u0004 rac\u00de is small, we may approximate the exponential\nusing a first-order Maclaurin series, giving\nln\u00f0exp\u00f0\u00042 ffiffigp \u00f0ralim \u0004 rac\u00de\u00de \u0004 1\u00de \b ln\u00f0\u00042 ffiffigp \u00f0ralim \u0004 rac\u00de\u00de.\nOur simplified expression for tc becomes\ntc \u00bc\nracffiffi\ng\np \u0004 1\n2\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nrac\ng\nffiffi\ng\np\nr\nln\u00f0\u00042 ffiffigp \u00f0ralim \u0004 rac\u00de\u00de.
