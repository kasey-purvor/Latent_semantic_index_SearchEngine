Distributed Bragg re-\nflectors (DBRs) are typically used to provide filtering of the\nlaser cavity modes and select one mode from the spectrum, as\nthey offer larger tuning ranges relative to distributed feedback\nlasers. Devices incorporating more complex multiple tuning\nsections (e.g., periodically sampled grating elements) such as\nthe sampled-grating DBR laser (SG-DBR) [4], the superstruc-\nture grating DBR laser (SSG-DBR) [5], and the grating-assisted\ncodirectional coupler with sampled reflectors (GCSR) [6], [7]\nhave demonstrated wide tuning ranges (>40 nm) and high un-\nwanted mode suppression. However, the tuning speed of lasers\nbased on current injection depends on the carrier density changes\nrequired to obtain tuning and is limited by the carrier lifetime\nin the passive (nonamplifying) sections. Wide tuning ranges re-\nquire large current changes in the passive sections, resulting in\nincreased switching times, particularly when switching occurs\ndue to a change from high to low current [8], [9]. Tuning times\nof several nanoseconds are typical for such lasers [9]\u2013[12]. An-\nother consequence of the large current changes required for\nwide wavelength tuning range is heating of the device. Ther-\nmal effects cause significant wavelength drifts of microsecond\ntimescales, which can degrade system performance [13], [14].\nAn alternative way to induce refractive index changes in the\nlaser cavity is by applying a reverse bias to the tuning sections\nand utilizing field effects such as the Franz\u2013Keldysh (FK) and\nthe quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). These effects are\nbased on the absorption edge change in the presence of an elec-\ntric field, which affects the complex dielectric constant of the\nsemiconductor material at wavelengths close to the bandgap.\nThe FK effect relates to bulk material, while QCSE occurs in\nstructures containing quantum wells. Switching using these ef-\nfects is not limited by the carrier lifetime, but by the capacitance\nof the device, making the technique promising for faster switch-\ning times. In addition, the lower amount of current in the laser\ncavity has the potential to reduce thermal effects associated with\nhigh current, and the accompanying problems of wavelength\ndrift.\nWavelength tuning based on the FK effect has been demon-\nstrated within 500 ps across 2.5 nm wavelength range, in a butt-\njointed structure realized by selective area epitaxy regrowth [15].\nAlthough an improved design utilizing a superstructure grat-\ning was proposed to increase the tuning range, the low refrac-\ntive index changes induced by the FK effect (in bulk material)\nultimately limit the tuning range to \u223c11 nm [16]. Using the\nQCSE is a more promising approach due to the sharper excitonic\n1077-260X\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Schematic of the QCSE-tuned laser.\nabsorption peak in quantum well structures that results in higher\nrefractive index changes in the material. QCSE tuning was ini-\ntially demonstrated in an external cavity laser [17], and later, in\na tuneable twin-guide DFB laser structure with InGaAsP bulk\nactive region and separate MQW tuning section [18], and in\na butt-joined DBR laser with an MQW tuning region realized\nduring separate growth steps [19], resulting in FM responses\nof <5 GHz. In [20], we demonstrated an integrated two-section\nGaAs\/AlGaAs laser cavity without DBR that was tuned utilizing\nthe QCSE. In this paper, we present a monolithically integrated\nthree-section InGaAsP QCSE-tuned DBR laser structure. Re-\nverse bias is applied to both the DBR and the phase sections\nto control the lasing wavelength, with constant current on the\ngain section. The active and passive sections use the same mul-\ntiple quantum well (MQW) material, while the absorption in the\npassive sections has been reduced via quantum well intermixing\n(QWI). QWI based on ion implantation is applied after complete\ngrowth of the structure. The technique has the advantage that\nonly one epitaxial regrowth is required after the formation of\nthe DBR, maintaining the simplicity of the fabrication process.\nUsing this device, noncontinuous tuning is demonstrated over\n\u223c7 nm by varying the reverse bias from 0 to\u22122.5 V, with a side\nmode suppression ratio (SMSR) of \u223c20 dB, and tuning times\n<3 ns limited by the driving source used. FM frequency re-\nsponse measurements indicate that wavelength switching speeds\nof 100 ps are possible with this device. Significant improvements\nin the tuning range and SMSR can be accomplished by changing\nthe DBR design.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The QCSE\ntuning is modeled in Section II using experimental absorption\nmeasurements. The device fabrication and quantum well inter-\nmixing process are described in Section III. Section IV describes\nstatic and dynamic measurements on the QCSE DBR laser. Con-\nclusions from the work are presented in Section V.\nII. QCSE-TUNED LASER THEORY\nThe schematic of the QCSE-tuned DBR laser is shown in\nFig. 1. The device comprises an active section that provides the\ngain, and two passive sections, namely the phase and the DBR.\nThe three sections are electrically isolated and individually bi-\nased. A constant current is applied to the active section, while the\nFig. 2. Absorption spectra for the QW structure of Fig. 6 with electric field.\nphase and DBR sections are reverse biased. The waveguide re-\ngion includes an MQW structure that is common for all sections\nbut is quantum well intermixed in the passive sections to reduce\nthe loss. The grating section is a periodic DBR structure, formed\non an InGaAsP layer above the waveguide region. Details on\nthe device structure and fabrication are given in Section III.\nA. QCSE Refractive Index Changes\nWhen a voltage is applied perpendicular to a p-i-n structure\nwith an MQW, the energy bandgap is tilted and the wavefunc-\ntions of the electrons and holes in the wells are pulled apart,\ncausing the exciton absorption peaks to red shift and the exciton\noscillator strength to reduce. This is the QCSE [21]. The re-\nfractive index changes that accompany the absorption changes\ncan be used to modify the light path in a multisection tuneable\nlaser, tuning the wavelength of the output light. Fig. 2 shows the\nvariation of the absorption spectrum of an intermixed, strain-\nbalanced InGaAsP MQW laser structure such as that described\nin Section III. The absorption spectrum was calculated from\nphotocurrent measurements under the effect of an electric field,\nwith light incident normal to the wafer, using the equation\n\u03b1m = \u22121\nd\nln\n(\n1\u2212 hc \u21c0\u21bdIph\ne \u03b7 Pip (1\u2212R) \u21c0\u21bd \u03bb\n)\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1m (\u03bb) is the material absorption, d is the thickness of the\nquantum wells, h is Planck\u2019s constant, c is the speed of light in\nvacuum, Iph is the photocurrent, e is the electron charge, \u03b7 is the\nquantum efficiency, where \u03b7 = 0.9 was used, Pip is the incident\noptical power, R is the reflectivity of the air\u2013semiconductor\ninterface, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\nThe absorption changes observed with increasing magnitude\nof reverse bias result in refractive index changes that can be\ncalculated by the Kramers\u2013Kronig equation [22]\n\u2206nm (\u03bb, E) =\n\u03bb2\n2\u03c02\nP\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u2206\u03b1m (\u03bb\u2032, E)\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb\u20322 d\u03bb\n\u2032 (2)\nwhere E is the electric field, P is the Cauchy principal value of\nthe integral, and \u2206\u03b1m and \u2206nm are the material absorption and\nrefractive index changes, respectively, relative to zero electric\nfield, both depending on the electric field and the wavelength.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Refractive index change due to electric field derived from data of\nFig. 2. The changes quoted are with reference to the zero-field case.\nFig. 3 presents the refractive index change spectrum (\u2206nm )\ncalculated from (2) using the absorption spectra of Fig. 2.\nThough there is a wide spectral range where QCSE-induced\nrefractive index changes could be used, their amplitude varies\nwith wavelength. Significant refractive index changes are ob-\nserved at longer wavelengths than the exciton absorption peak.\nFor this spectral range, the absorption and absorption changes\ndue to QCSE are lower. A device with intermixed passive sec-\ntions can take advantage of this as its exciton absorption peak\nwill be blue shifted. In that case, lasing occurs at wavelengths\nlonger than that of the exciton absorption peak of the passive\nsections. Furthermore, as absorption changes due to QCSE will\nremain small, tuning of the lasing wavelength is possible without\nsuffering large variations of the laser output power.\nB. Tuning Mechanism\nThe wavelength tuning due to refractive index changes in the\nDBR section can be calculated using the transmission matrix\ntheory [23].

Epitaxial Structure\nThe structure, the schematic crosssection, and a top pic-\nture of the fabricated QCSE DBR laser are shown in Fig. 6.\nThe wafer was grown by metal\u2013organic vapor phase epitaxy\n(MOVPE) on a semi-insulating InP substrate. The waveguide\nregion incorporates eight 7-nm-wide compressively strained In-\nGaAsP (\u03bbg = 1.65 \u00b5m) quantum wells and seven 14-nm-wide\ntensile strained InGaAsP (\u03bbg = 1.3 \u00b5m) barriers, sandwiched\nbetween two InGaAsP (\u03bbg = 1.3 \u00b5m) waveguide layers. Above\nthe waveguide region, a 170-nm-InP spacer layer and a 30 nm In-\nGaAsP (\u03bbg = 1.3 \u00b5m) grating layer, both p-doped, were grown.\nThe growth was interrupted at this stage, and a first-order grating\nwas formed on the InGaAsP layer in the area required for the\nDBR section. The structure was completed by the overgrowth\nof a 1.4 \u00b5m p-InP layer, a 0.2 \u00b5m p-InGaAs contact layer, a\n0.5 \u00b5m InP implantation buffer layer, and a final 0.1 \u00b5m In-\nGaAs implantation buffer layer. Following growth, the tuning\nsections were quantum well intermixed using ion implantation,\nas described in the next section.\nB. Postgrowth Quantum Well Intermixing\nIn the QCSE DBR laser, the gain and the passive sections uti-\nlize the same MQW area. As a consequence, the absorption peak\nof the passive sections is close to the lasing wavelength, intro-\nducing significant loss. To reduce the absorption experienced by\nthe light generated in the active section and transmitted through\nthe tuning sections, we used postgrowth QWI to blue shift the\nbandgap of the passive sections. In QWI, partial mixing of the\nelements of the wells with those of the barriers can increase\nthe energy bandgap of the wells, and blue shift the photolumi-\nnescence peak. The shift depends on the extent of intermixing,\nwhich can be varied by changing different parameters of the\nmethod used. The advantage of postgrowth QWI compared to\nselective area epitaxy regrowth is that it is less complex to use,\nparticularly when the passive sections incorporate QWs, while\nit can also be used to create multiple bandgap detunings on the\nsame wafer in a single QWI step [25].\nThere are a few techniques that have been used to achieve\nQWI, such as impurity-free vacancy disordering (IFVD)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In\nthis paper, we apply shallow ion implantation of P + ions fol-\nlowed by thermal annealing [31], [32]. In contrast to high energy\nimplantation, shallow implantation introduces defects above the\ncladding, which are then diffused into the quantum wells during\nannealing. If a sacrificial implantation buffer layer is used, the\nimplantation energy can be chosen so that the ions stop in this\nlayer, which can be removed after annealing, leaving the ma-\nterial free of implanted ions. Compared to deep implantation,\nshallow implantation can, therefore, maintain better material\ncrystalline quality. In the past, this method was used to inter-\nmix partially grown structures, while the remaining p-doped\ntop layers were overgrown after intermixing and removing the\nimplantation buffer layer [32], [34]. This was done to prevent\ndiffusion of the p-dopants into the laser active region during\nthermal annealing, and hence, performance degradation. In this\npaper, we use shallow ion implantation followed by rapid ther-\nmal annealing at 650 \u25e6C to blue shift the passive sections after\ncompletion of growth of the full structure. The method uses\nimplantation buffer layers of different material composition to\nvary the degree of intermixing, and can be applied to achieve\nmultiple bandgap detunings on the sample during the same QWI\nstep.\nWhen implantation is used for QWI, the bandgap detuning\ncan be varied by changing the implantation energy, the dose,\nthe annealing time, or temperature. In particular, increasing the\nannealing temperature enhances the intermixing, but also in-\ncreases the risk for Zn diffusion. Varying the material of the\ntop buffer layer provides yet another parameter for bandgap de-\ntuning control, because the types of defects generated in the\nmaterial during implantation depend on the material compo-\nsition itself. Increased bandgap blue shifts have been reported\nusing an InGaAs cap layer, compared to an InP cap, below the\nSiO2 layer in IFVD [27], [28]. In order to investigate this in the\ncase of shallow implantation and to select the final conditions\nfor the QCSE-tuned lasers, we performed calibration runs using\nonly the InP or both the InGaAs and InP implantation buffer\nlayers of the structure of Fig. 6. To prevent Zn diffusion and\nblue shifting in the active section, annealing was performed at\n650 \u25e6C temperature.\nSamples from the wafer structure described in the previous\nsection were cleaved, and the InGaAs cap layer was removed\nfrom half of them, using selective wet etching. The gain sec-\ntion of both types of samples was then covered with 600 nm\nSiO2 deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposi-\ntion (PECVD) to prevent intermixing of the area. The samples\nwere subsequently implanted with P+ ions at 100 kV energy\nand 200 \u25e6C temperature, at dose 8\u00d7 1014 cm\u22122. After implan-\ntation, annealing was performed at 650 \u25e6C for various times.\nDuring rapid thermal annealing, a clean-polished InP substrate\nwas used as the proximity cap. A comparison of the effect of the\ntop layer composition was also performed. An example of the\nphotoluminescence shift of two passive sections with InP only\nand InP plus a small InGaAs caps, both annealed for 300 s at\n650 \u25e6C, is shown in Fig. 7. The photoluminescence of the active\nsection after the QWI process is also shown for comparison.\nFig. 7. Room temperature photoluminescence spectra after implantation and\nannealing at 650 \u25e6C for 5 min. (a) From unimplanted laser section. (b) From\npassive sections with an InP cap.

(b) Sim-\nulation of the groups III and V vacancies created during implantation through a\ntop InGaAs and a top InP cap layer.\nIt was found that, for the same QWI conditions, the samples\nwith the InGaAs cap resulted in higher bandgap detuning of the\nimplanted material, while in both cases, the photoluminescence\nshift of the unimplanted gain section was negligible. Fig. 8(a)\nshows in more detail the bandgap detuning for samples with\nan InP or InGaAs cap as a function of annealing time. There\nhave been a number of theories on how intermixing takes place\nin InGaAsP, and bandgap detuning has been ascribed to the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fig. 8(b) shows the damage induced by implantation with\nonly the InP and with both the InGaAs and InP implantation\nlayers on top of the basic laser structure. The simulation was\nperformed using TRIM [35], which does not account for high-\ntemperature implantation effects, but nevertheless gives an in-\nsight of the damage produced during implantation. Although\nwith the InGaAs cap, the peak of the distribution of defects is\nfurther away from the active region, the number of calculated\ndefects generated in this case is almost double, as confirmed by\nthe larger detuning measured [Fig. 8(a)].\nAfter the calibration runs for the QWI process, samples with\nthe InGaAs cap that would be processed into QCSE-tuned lasers\nwere covered with PECVD SiO2, implanted using the same\nconditions as before and annealed at 650 \u25e6C for 90 s. In this\nway, the photoluminescence peak of the passive sections was\nblue shifted by \u223c37 nm compared to the gain section, in the\nfinal devices. Following fabrication, the samples were cleaved\nto form devices with 1-mm-long gain section, 170-\u00b5m-long\nphase section, and 160-\u00b5m-long DBR section. The output light\nfrom each facet was measured as a function of current in the\ngain section, for a nonintermixed and an intermixed device,\nand is shown in Fig. 9. For these measurements, the passive\nsections were kept at 0 V bias. Significant reduction of the loss\nexperienced by light output from the DBR facet is observed\nafter QWI. A somewhat higher annealing time could result in\neven lower loss. The lasing threshold was only slightly increased\nafter QWI, while mode hopping was observed with increasing\ncurrent in both cases, due to changes in the laser cavity phase\nwith increasing current.\nC. Device Fabrication\nAfter growth and intermixing, the wafer was processed into\nridge waveguide lasers, with three sections, the gain, the phase,\nand the DBR mirror. Both the p- and n-contacts were formed\non top of the wafer, while bridges on silicon oxynitride were\nused to connect the p-contact to the bonding pads to reduce the\ndevice capacitance. The measured capacitance of the device was\n\u223c200 fF\/100 \u00b5m. A more detailed description of the fabrication\nprocedure can be found in [36].\nTo use the QCSE as the tuning mechanism, the phase and the\nDBR sections need to be reverse biased, while the gain section\nis forward biased. In a monolithically integrated device, where\nFig. 10. Examples of the measured output spectra. The dashed line on the first\nfigure represents the spectrum of a 170-\u00b5m-long cavity.\nthe three sections have a common intrinsic region, good elec-\ntrical isolation between the sections is necessary. In this work,\nelectrical isolation between the sections was accomplished by\nremoving the top p-InGaAs and p-InP contact layers from a\n30-\u00b5m-wide gap between different sections. This resulted in\n\u223c15 k\u2126 resistance between neighboring p-contacts with the\ngain section unbiased. Higher contact resistance is possible by\nusing ion implantation [15]. Neither of the facets was antireflec-\ntion (AR) coated for the results presented in this paper.\nIV. LASER RESULTS\nA. Static Measurements\nFor the tuning measurements of the QCSE DBR laser, the\nbias current of the gain section was kept at 150 mA, while the\nreverse bias was varied from 0 to\u22122.5 V on the DBR, and from\n0 to\u22121 V on the phase section. Fig. 10 illustrates an example of\nthe spectra measured at the output of the QCSE DBR laser. The\nvariation of the peak output power for all the lasing wavelengths\nmeasured was <6 dB, while the SMSR of the laser was\u223c20 dB,\nresulting in nontrivial mode competition. A DBR mirror with\nstronger filtering characteristic would be desirable. The spectra\nexhibit modulation of the side modes with period that agrees\nwell with the 170 \u00b5m length of the phase section (dotted line in\nFig. 10). This modulation is attributed to a secondary cavity that\nis formed between the two isolation gaps, one separating the\nphase section from the DBR mirror and the second between the\nphase and the gain sections, resulting in secondary minima in\nthe spectrum, that do not allow for continuous tuning between\nthe laser modes. This is due to the deep etch of the p-doped\nlayers performed in order to electrically isolate the sections,\nwhich modified sufficiently the effective refractive index along\na distance of 30 \u00b5m, to result in the formation of a secondary\ncavity.\nIn Fig. 11(a), the lasing wavelength is plotted versus DBR\nvoltage, while the phase voltage is shown in brackets. The phase\nvoltage was varied to optimize the SMSR. The dotted line in\nFig. 11(a) shows an exemplary tuning region of high SMSR\nwhile both the grating and phase current were changed. One\ncan note the discontinuities in the tuning map that are mainly\ndue to lateral mode jump and the coupled cavity effects referred\nto before. In general, the lasing wavelength is moving toward\nshorter wavelengths across \u223c7 nm range, as the DBR voltage\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

(b) Detail of (a), showing the tuning for fixed phase voltage (VP ),\nfor values VP = 0V (\u2022), VP = \u22120.2 V (\u0001), and VP = \u22120.3 V (\u25e6).\nreduces. The tuning range is comparable to the calculated value\nof \u223c8 nm.\nThe tuning to shorter wavelength, as expected from the calcu-\nlation shown in Fig. 4, with reducing DBR voltage is also shown\nin Fig. 11(b), where examples of wavelength tuning for fixed\nphase bias are plotted. Note that, for this measurement, several\nmode jumps where observed across the tuning range and the\npoint given are only the one with a good SMSR. As expected\nfrom the modeling, the amount of QCSE tuning does not evolve\nlinearly with the applied voltage [Fig. 11(b)]. Again, it agrees\nwell with Fig. 4, for the case that the DBR central wavelength is\npositioned at \u223c40 nm longer wavelength than the exciton peak\n(\u03b4\u03bbG0 = 40 nm), which is the closest approximation to the final\ndevice. From Fig. 5, it was expected that the fine tuning induced\nby the phase section will result in shorter output wavelength\nwhen the voltage is reduced. However, from a given voltage,\nwe observed the opposite effect [Fig. 11(b)], that the fine phase\ntuning was inducing a total shift toward longer wavelength. It\nwas found that this is not due to leakage current. Alternatively,\nwe believe that the main reason for this to occur is that reduc-\ning the phase voltage red shifts the absorption peak toward the\nwavelength of interest, resulting in an increase of absorption in\nthe phase section. This, in turn, reduces the light input to the\nDBR, which causes a decrease of the photocurrent in the DBR\nsection. Lower photocurrent corresponds to reduced absorption\nand refractive index changes in the DBR section. This trend\ncompetes with the increase in absorption in the DBR due to the\ndecrease of the DBR voltage, resulting in coarse tuning toward\nshorter and fine tuning toward longer wavelength.\nB. Dynamic Measurements\nDynamic characterization of the QCSE DBR laser was carried\nout using the configuration of Fig. 12. Two kinds of experiments\nwere performed, the first using a step voltage pulse to measure\nthe switching speed between two lasing wavelengths, while the\nsecond was a small signal sinusoidal frequency response mea-\nsurement. During both experiments, the phase section was kept\nat fixed reverse bias to simplify the measurement, while the\nDBR section tuning voltage was applied through a coplanar\nprobe with a 65 GHz bandwidth.\nFig. 12. Experimental configuration for dynamic measurements. The QCSE\nDBR laser was driven using the square pulse generator for the switching mea-\nsurements and the sinusoidal frequency generator for the FM response measure-\nment.\nFig. 13. Oscilloscope traces showing laser output power when switching from\nwavelength \u03bb1 and wavelength \u03bb2.\nIn the first experiment, the DBR section was driven using\na step voltage pulse, between values of the reverse bias that\ncorresponded to two different lasing wavelengths. Since the\nphase voltage was not varied simultaneously with the DBR\nreverse bias, only a limited range of switching wavelengths,\nhaving good SMSR, were measured. The resulting optical pulse\noutput from the QCSE DBR laser passed through an optical filter\nof 0.5 nm bandwidth and the rise and fall times were measured\non a sampling oscilloscope with a 60 GHz photodiode. As rise\nor fall time, we refer to the time required for transition between\n10% and 90% power at the desired wavelength. Fig. 13 shows\nthe waveforms observed for a switching pulse of 5 \u00b5s duration.\nFor this measurement, the voltage on the phase section was\nkept at \u223c\u2212 0.2 V, and the voltage on the DBR was varied\nbetween 0.5 and \u22121.2 V, resulting in wavelengths \u03bb1 = 1561.2\nnm and \u03bb2 = 1559.8 nm, respectively. When the optical power\nat wavelength \u03bb1 was off, lasing at the second wavelength \u03bb2\nwas being switched on. The response is seen to be free of thermal\noverhang. Details of the leading and falling edges of the driving\nvoltage pulse with corresponding optical power changes are\nshown in Fig. 14. Although the rise and fall times of the voltage\npulse source were approximately 800 ps, there was an overshoot\nof \u223c0.2 V of the voltage pulse before it was stabilized at the\nnew state within\u223c3.5 ns, as shown in Fig. 14(a). This overshoot\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:11 from IEEE Xplore.

(b)\nDetail of laser output power at wavelength \u03bb2.\nFig. 15. FM frequency response of the QCSE-tuned DBR laser.\nwas sufficient to cause the lasing wavelength to switch outside\nthe bandwidth of the filter used in this measurement so that the\ncorrect voltage was only achieved after\u223c3 ns. For the fall time,\nthe voltage merely needs to change sufficiently to tune the laser\nout of the filter bandwidth, resulting in a much more rapid fall\ntime for the detected optical power. It can be seen that the laser\nchanges wavelength within 1 ns of the correct voltage being\nreached.\nThe second experiment performed for dynamic character-\nization of the device was a frequency modulation frequency\nresponse measurement. In this case, the device was driven by\na sinusoidal frequency generator with a peak-to-peak voltage\n1 V at frequencies up to 40 GHz. The peak-to-peak value and\nthe dc bias on the DBR section were chosen to keep the laser\noperation within a continuous tuning region while retaining the\nlargest possible range of wavelength scanned. The optical sig-\nnal from the QCSE-tuned laser was transmitted through a 2-\nnm-bandwidth optical filter for FM slope detection. During this\nmeasurement, the phase section was kept at 0 V bias. The mea-\nsured response is shown in Fig. 15. An FM 3 dB bandwidth\nof 10 GHz was measured, suggesting that a switching speed of\n100 ps is possible with this device.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA monolithically integrated InGaAsP DBR laser using QCSE\nas the tuning mechanism has been demonstrated. The laser be-\nhavior was modeled using transmission matrix equations pre-\ndicting nonlinear tuning behavior and a quasi-continuous tun-\ning range of \u223c8 nm with the absorption peak of the tuning\nsections blue shifted relatively to the lasing wavelength. Post-\ngrowth QWI based on shallow implantation was used to blue-\nshift the absorption peak wavelength of the tuning sections and\nreduce the loss. In a nonoptimized device exhibiting coupled\ncavity effects, noncontinuous tuning across\u223c7 nm was demon-\nstrated when the DBR voltage was varied from 0 to\u22122.5 V, with\n\u223c20 dB SMSR and <6 dB variation of the output power. Switch-\ning times <3 ns were measured, limited by the switching pulse\nrise time, while FM frequency response measurements suggest\nthat 100 ps switching times would be possible with such a\ndevice.\nSeveral improvements can be made to this device, including\nusing implantation to isolate neighboring sections and suppress\ncoupled cavity effects responsible for tuning discontinuities, im-\nproving the mirror design to increase SMSR, aligning the lasing\nwavelength range with the wavelength range of minimum ab-\nsorption change in the passive sections to reduce power fluctua-\ntions and varying separately the bandgap detuning of the passive\nsections to reduce tuning due to variations of the photocurrent in\nthe phase section. Finally, considerable refractive index changes\nwere measured across a\u223c30 nm spectral range with this device,\nsuggesting that a design utilizing multiple tuning sections could\nbe used to offer wide tuning range.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.-T.
