Prior to its export, crude oil is temporarily housed in storage\ntanks, dehydrated and fiscalised. These facilities require scheduled\nmaintenance. Maintenance and improvement projects at these terminals\ngenerate huge (in terms of pollution potential) volumes of oily sludge during\nthe cleaning of the storage tanks and heaters. Oily sludge, from the\nimprovement project of the Bonny Terminal in the Niger Delta region of\nNigeria, is characterized by high THC levels, i.e. of toxic substances such\nas aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene)\nand poly aromatic hydrocarbons (Swoboda-Colberg, 1995; DPR, 2002).\nBecause of this, land and \/or sea disposal of this oily sludge without\nprevious remedial treatment poses serious threats to the environment and\nhuman beings The treatment of this oily sludge usually has been achieved\nthrough incineration as recommended by the Department of Petroleum\nResources (DPR). However, incinerating petroleum wastes, apart from\nbeing prohibitively expensive (Shkidchenko et al, 2004), also results in the\nuse of enormous amounts of additional fuel (Mrayyan and Battikhi, 2005),\nwhich contributes to the already fast-depleting rates of fossil-fuel resources.\nAgain, personnel and equipment are exposed to the resulting fugitive dusts.\nConcern about these drawbacks of the incineration method and the need to\ndetoxify and reclaim this oily sludge prompts a need to adopt a treatment\nmethod that is cheap, simple and environmentally friendly. Recently, a\nplethora of research has shown that bioremediation offers an excellent\nmeans for reclaiming soil that has become polluted. In Nigeria, various\nmethods of bioremediation have been used to reclaim soil polluted by crude\noil (Amadi et al, 1993; Onwurah, 1996; Odokwuma and Dickson, 2003;\nObire and Akinde, 2004; Ebuehi et al, 2005; Ayotamuno et al, 2006).\nHowever, there is a dearth of research concerning the use of bio-\naugmentation to treat oily sludge.\nIn this study, bio-augmentation, which is the addition of micro-\norganisms like bacteria and fungi to detoxify the polluted media (Atlas and\nBartha, 1972), is employed to decontaminate oily sludge from the Bonny\nTerminal Improvement Project (BTIP). Although, intrinsic bioremediation is\n4inherently a slow process (Mitchell et al, 2000; Wills, 2000), bio-\naugmentation involves the use of a microbial consortium to enhance the\ndegradation of the contaminated media (Noyes, 1994). Bio-augmentation\noffers a viable means of seeding, with the competent micro-flora, to ensure\nthe effective breakdown of targeted contaminants in the polluted media.\nThe present study assessed the effectiveness of using bacillus and\npseudomonas, which are the constituents of the bacteria consortia, in the\nbioremediation of the BTIP oily-sludge.\n2.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Study Area\nThe oily sludge for this study was obtained from the Bonny Island\nTerminal, Rivers State, Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It forms part of the\nsouthern Nigeria coastal zone, and Rivers State falls within the lowland rain-\nforest ecological expanse. The micro-climatology, according to the\nMeteorological Department of the Federal Ministry of Aviation (2003),\nindicates that the State has a mean annual rainfall of 2369mm and a mean\nmaximum daily-temperature of 28oC.\n2.2 The Sludge\nUsing plastic containers, samples were taken randomly every three\ndays from the uppermost 5cm layer of the composite sludge. The containers\nwere then properly sealed with polyethylene materials to preserve the\nintegrity of the smples. Some samples were immediately transferred to the\nlaboratory for initial characterization, while the others were taken to the\nresearch campus for treatment.\n2.3 Preparation of Medium for Enumeration of Heterotrophic\nBacteria\nThe medium used for the serial dilution of the sample was normal\nsaline-solution. In preparing this, all diluents and media were sterilized in an\nautoclave at 121oC for 15 minutes and all glassware sterilized in a dry hot-\nair oven at 160oC. Then 0.85g of sodium chloride (NaCl) was weighed out\nand transferred into 100ml of distilled water inside a beaker and mixed\nthoroughly. Subsequently, 9ml of the solution was dispensed into a test tube\n5and sterilized at 121oC for 15 minutes. After which, it became the solution\nfor serial dilution of the oil-sludge sample.\n2.4 Cultivation and Enumeration of Viable Heterotrophic Bacteria\nIn culturing the bacteria, use was made of nutrient agar and oil agar\nalready prepared in the Microbiology Laboratory of the University. To do\nthis, 1.0g (dry weight) of fine sludge was homogenized with 1.0 x 10-6m3 of\nsterile distilled-water to give 10-1 dilutions; and 1 x 10-6m3 of the 10-1 dilution\nwas transferred into the next test tube containing 9.0 x 10-6m3 normal saline\n(diluent) and diluted serially in one tenth steps up to 10-3 dilution (Harringan\nand McGrane, 1990). From the dilutions of 10-2 and 10-3 of each sludge\nsample, a 0.1 x 10-6m3 aliquot was transferred aseptically onto nutrient agar-\nplates, supplemented with oil agar, and spread with a bent glass rod. The\ninoculated plates were incubated at 37oC for 24 hours. Thereafter, the plates\nwere examined for any growths on them. Discrete colonies of heterotrophic\nbacteria in the sludge were recorded.\n2.5 Isolation and Identification of Bacteria\nCulturable bacteria were prepared by aseptically streaking\nrepresentative colonies of different cultural types, which appeared on the\nculture plates, onto nutrient agar-plates and incubated at 28oC for 24 hours.\nThe nutrient agar plates were stored in a refrigerator and served as pure\nstock culture for subsequent characterization and identification tests.\nStandard characterization tests (such as grain staining, motility, methyl-red,\nVogues Proskaver, indole, citrate utilization and sugar fermentation) were\nperformed. The pure culture was identified on the basis of its cultural,\nmorphological and physiological characteristics (Cowan, 1974; Buchanan\nand Gibbons, 1974).\n2.6 Experimental Design\nFour plastic containers (i.e. the reactor vessels) consisting of three\ntreatment-reactors and one control-reactor were used for this study. Control\nreactor A was not to be subjected to any treatment while reactors X, Y, and\nZ were labelled to receive different levels of treatment. Agricultural soil\ncontaining indigenous microbes and nutrients was obtained from within the\n6Research Campus. Then 1.5kg of oil sludge and 0.25kg of this agricultural\nsoil were added to each of the reactors in turn. This mix ratio (i.e. sludge:\nsoil = 6:1) corresponded with that used by Ouyang et al (2005). The mixture\nwas thoroughly mixed and allowed to settle for seven days so that microbial\nactivity could ensue before the application of the working solution of the bio-\npreparation (including HUB), which was added to reactors X and Y at cell\ndensities of (7.6 x 1011 CFU\/ml) and (7.4 x 1011 CFU\/ml) respectively.\nReactor Z was treated with the mixed culture (1.5 x 1012 CFU\/ml). Reactor A\ndid not receive any bio-preparation. The experiments lasted for 42 days\nunder an ambient temperature of 30oC. Mixing and watering were repeated\nevery three days.\n2.7 Chemical Analysis\nThe THC was determined using a PRESTIGE-21 IR-\nSpectrophotometer by measuring light absorbance at wavelengths of 3704\nto 3333nm according to ASTM (1999) methods. Bonny light crude-oil was\nused to calibrate the equipment beforehand. Other physico-chemical\nparameters; namely pH, moisture content, organic carbon-content, carbon-\nnitrogen ratio, and available phosphorus were determined according to the\nAPHA (1998) standards.\n3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION (See Tables 1 \u2013 8)\n3.1 THC Reduction\nThe effects of microbial addition on the THC reduction in the oily\nsludge is shown in Figure 1. The THC reductions in the oily sludge were\n40.7 to 53.2% and 63.7 to 84.5% within two and six weeks of bio-\naugmentation respectively. The indigenous micro-organisms (as in Reactor\nA) could reduce the THC by a limited amount (i.e. 6 to 12.8%) within the\nsame period of bio-augmentation despite being aerated by mixing and\nwatering. This indicates that the bio-preparation addition achieved a\nsignificant advantage over just having the indigenous microbes alone in the\nTHC reduction.\n73.2 Change in pH\nIt has been stated that, in the presence of excess nutrients and\noxygen, the pH value of an oily sludge under microbial degradation would\ndrop (Marn and Khodijah, 2004). In the present study, the initial pH value of\nthe oily sludge was 5.8 (Table 1) but varied between 6.5 and 6.8 at the end\nof the second week (Table 5) and between 7.7 and 7.8 at the end of the\nsixth week (Table 6) of bioremediation. The pH value of the control\nspecimen (in Reactor A) varied from 6.0 to 6.7 during the same period of\nbioremediation. From these results, the pH of the oily sludge increased\nduring the remediation period, which implied that the nutrient and oxygen\nlevels were not in excess. The final pH range (i.e. 7.7 to 7.8, Table 6) did\nnot fall out of the range 7 to 8, which is said to be the optimal range for\ndegrading micro-flora (Chaerun, 1995). This result also corroborated that\nobtained by Ouyang et al (2005).\n3.3 Identification of Bacteria Isolates\nBased on their cultural and colonial characteristics, two different\nbacteria species were identified on the inoculated plates, namely bacillus\nand pseudomonas (Table 2). The initial population of the colony forming\nhydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria identified is shown in Table 3. The bacillus\nspecies was slightly more populous than the pseudomonas species.\n3.4 Microbial Activity\nTable 7 shows the variation of microbial counts during the\nbioremediation of the oily sludge. The microbial counts varied from 1.2 x\n1012 to 3.0 x 1012 CFU\/g of sludge within two weeks and decreased to 7.0 x\n1011 CFU\/g of sludge at the end of the sixth week. In the control reactor A,\nmicrobial counts varied from 3.0 x 105 to 3.2x105 CFU\/g of sludge within two\nweeks and decreased to 2.8 x 105 CFU\/g of sludge at the end of the sixth\nweek. Thus, seeding with HUB increased the microbial counts and this had\na profound influence on the rate of THC reduction. Evidently, the mixed\nculture in reactor Z had the highest influence on the degradation of the oily\nsludge (Table 8). The reduction in microbial counts by the sixth week was\npartly due to the process of eutrophication of the micro-flora.\n84.0 CONCLUSIONS\nThe use of bio-augmentation in the bioremediation of the BTIP oily-\nsludge reduced the THC of the sludge from an initial 69,372mg\/kg of sludge\nto 10,734mg\/kg of sludge (representing an 84.5% reduction) after six weeks\nof treatment. But in the control reactor, only a 12.8% THC reduction was\nachieved during the same period. This shows that the addition of microbes\nenhanced the degradation of the oily sludge, which implies that bio-\naugmentation is an effective bioremediation technology for dealing with an\noily sludge. The performance, in terms of THC reduction, of the two strains\nof bacteria (bacillus and pseudomonas) used in the mixed culture during the\nbio-augmentation process, was better than the performance of individuals\nstrains in the pure culture. Between the two strains, pseudomonas appears\nto be the better degrader\n5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS\nBecause of the spate of environmental-degradation incidents,\noccasioned by increased crude-oil and natural gas activities in the Niger\nDelta region of Nigeria, urgent efforts are necessary to implement remedial\nactivities such as discussed in this report, but on a large scale. There is too\nmuch talk about the pollution, but so little implementation commercially.\nHowever, bioremediation is fast becoming one of the most economic and\nenvironmentally-friendly technologies for hydrocarbon- contaminated site\nrestoration. To this end, it is recommended that hydrocarbon-contaminated\noily-sludge resulting from terminal improvement projects and other spillages\nbe treated by bio-remediation using bio-augmentation.\n9Table 1: Initial physicochemical parameter of BTIP oily sludge\nParameter Value\npH 5.8\nTotal hydrocarbon content, mg\/kg 69,372\nMoisture content, % 20.48\nOrganic carbon content, % 0.49\nTotal nitrogen content, % 0.13\nCarbon\/Nitrogen ratio 4\nAvailable phosphorus, \uf06d g\/g 1.02\nTable 2: Identification of bacteria isolates\nOrganism Cultural\/Colonial\nCharacteristics\nOther identifying\ncharacteristics\nBacillus species Colonies are indented,\nflat, whitish, opaque, dry\nwith serrated edge and\nsmooth surfaces.\nGram positive rods*,\ncatalase positive,\nmotile**, nitrate reduced,\nproduced acid from\nglucose, starch\nhydrolyzed.\nPseudomonas species Colonies are circular,\nflat, opaque, creamy,\nmoist with edge not\nserrated, dull surfaces\nand light green\npigmentation.\nGram negative rods*,\ncatalase positive,\nmotile**, nitrate reduced,\nproduced acid from\nglucose, starch\nhydrolyzed.\n*In microbiology, gram staining technique is used to distinguish bacteria into two major groups (morphologically) \u2013\ngram positive and gram negative bacteria.\n**Motile \u2013 motile bacteria move about when in liquid culture.\nTable 3: Initial microbial count of HUB in sludge after soil addition\nMicrobe Population (CFU\/g mix)\nBacillus 2.83 x 105\nPseudomonas 2.35 x 105\n10\nTable 4: Composition of material in the specified reactor\nReactors\nContent\nX Y Z A\nOil Sludge (g) 1500 1500 1500 1500\nSoil (g) 250 250 250 250\nAdded HUB (CFU\/ml) 7.6 x 1011 7.4 x 1011 1.5 x 1012 0\nTable 5: Physicochemical parameters of the oil sludge after 2 weeks\nof bio-augmentation\nValuesParameter\nX Y Z A\npH 6.5 6.7 6.8 6.0\nMoisture content (%) 21.76 21.76 23.46 19.76\nTotal hydrocarbon content\n(mg\/kg)\n41.126 40,026 32,487 65,231\nOrganic carbon content(%) 2.62 2.60 2.64 2.63\nTotal nitrogen content (%) 0.42 0.43 0.62 0.28\nCarbon\/nitrogen ratio 6 6 6 14\nAvailable phosphorus (\uf06d g\/ g) 2.80 2.56 3.01 1.20\nTable 6: Physicochemical parameters of the oil sludge after 6 weeks\nof bio-augmentation\nReactors\nParameter X Y Z A\npH 7.8 7.8 7.7 6.7\nMoisture content (%) 23.46 19.76 19.76 21.21\nTotal hydrocarbon content\n(mg\/kg) 25,190 24,231 10,734 60,498\nOrganic carbon content (%) 3.41 3.54 3.73 3.62\nTotal nitrogen content (%) 0.76 0.81 0.93 0.31\nCarbon\/nitrogen ratio 4 4 4 12\nAvailable phosphorus ( \uf06d g\/\ng) 4.20 4.01 4.05 1.40\n11\nTable 7: Microbial Counts after stated period of bio-augmentation\nMicrobes Population (CFU\/g of Sludge)\n2 Weeks\nX Y Z A\nBacillus 1.5 x 1012 - 3.0 x 1012 3.2 x 105\nPseudomonas - 1.2 x 1012 2.8 x 1012 3.0 x 105\n6 Weeks\nX Y Z A\nBacillus 1.10 x 1012 - 2.5 x 1012 3.0 x 105\nPseudomonas - 7.0 x 1011 2.0 x 1012 2.8 x 105\nTable 8: Percentage THC reduction after stated period of bio-\naugmentation\nReactor 0 Week 2 Weeks 6 Weeks\nX 0 40.7 63.7\nY 0 42.3 65.1\nZ 0 53.2 84.5\nA 0 6 12.8\nFigure 1: THC reduction history during the remediation\nperiod\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0 2 4 6 8\nTime (Weeks)\n%\nT\nH\nC\nR\ned\nu\nct\nio\nn\nReactor Z\nReactor Y\nReactor X\nReactor A\n12\nREFERENCES\nAmadi, A.
