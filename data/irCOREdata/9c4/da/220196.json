Edited by NATALIE GOLD and ROBERT SUGDEN. Princeton \nUniversity Press, Princeton and Oxford. 2006. xxiii + 214 pp. \n \n \n \nWith the death of Michael Bacharach in 2002 decision and game theory lost one of its \noriginal thinkers. Thanks to editors Natalie Gold and Robert Sugden the essence of his \nfinal project is now available in book form. In `Beyond Individual Choice'  Bacharach \naddresses two fundamental problems in the foundations of game theory: How can, and do, \nplayers coordinate on mutually beneficial equilibria? And what explains that players \ncooperate beyond that even in one-shot games? \n \nThe subtitle of the book --- `teams and frames in game theory' --- characterises \nBacharach's approach very well. In contrast to evolutionary or behavioral approaches he \nwrites in the tradition of classical game theory and seeks explanations and concepts that \nmodel such coordination and cooperation as rational choices. It is the rationality concept \nitself that is re-examined in this work. \n \nKey to Bacharach's theory is a distinction between the actual strategy set of a game and \nits description that informs the player's reasoning and choice. A frame is a set of possible \ndescriptions of subsets of strategies. A framed game is a normal form game in which each \nplayer has a frame, together with a probability that an individual description in the frame \nis available to the player when he reasons strategically and makes his choice. Beliefs \nabout the opponent's frame are then derived from the descriptions that are actually \navailable to the player. This model allows Bacharach to formulate the (attractive) \nassumption that a description not available to the player in choosing his own strategy will \nalso not be available to him when reasoning about his opponent. \n \nIn this framed game a player picks a description that is available to him. If the description \napplies to more than one strategy then one of them is chosen randomly. A variable frame \nequilibrium is then a Nash equilibrium in this framed game. Among these equilibria \nBacharach then eliminates (roughly put) those equilibria for which a symmetric \ncounterpart can be found (because rationality arguments cannot distinguish between them) \nand selects the payoff-dominant remaining equilibrium as the solution to the original \ngame. Bacharach argues that this construction yields the salient equilibrium in a \ncoordination game (even if not payoff-dominant) as the --- possibly unique --- variable \nframe equilibrium of the framed game. \n \nThis approach has many intriguing aspects, although some problems remain. For example, \nthe analysis depends heavily on how the frame is specified. While the approach sheds \nsome light on how a salient equilibrium of the original game is chosen, it is silent on what \nmakes an equilibrium salient. In particular, a payoff-dominant equilibrium need not be \nsalient, yet payoff-dominance plays an important role in defining a variable frame \nequilibrium. Overall the model appears to be much better at rationalising observed \nchoices than at making sharp predictions.  \n \nAfter a thorough and scholarly review of sources in the psychology and sociology \nliterature Bacharach next argues that coordination games trigger group identification, \nmeaning that players frame their role in the game as members of a group. The author then \ndevotes a chapter on how group identification is consistent with, or even follows from \nevolutionary theory.   \n \nBacharach\u2019s theory then comes into its own when he (implicitly) applies his concept of a \nvariable frame equilibrium to the frame created by group identification in coordination \ngames. Intuitively,  this frame allows team reasoning, in which a player identifies the \nstrategy that leads to the best outcome for the group. This, in turn, is proposed as an \nexplanation for selecting the payoff-dominant equilibrium in a coordination game.  \n \nSadly, Bacharach did not live to complete the argument and it is left to the editors  \nto elaborate on it in the conclusion. (They also note a tension between these concepts, \nhowever.)  There the editors also explain how this theory accounts for cooperation as a \n--- frame based --- `equilibrium\u2019 outcome in the prisoners\u2019 dilemma.  \n  \nThe book consists of four chapters written by Bacharach and intended to form the core of \na nine-chapter volume. These chapters are put into context by an introductory chapter \nwritten by the editors, and their conclusion rounds off the work. The editorial work is \nsuperb. The editors provide background, history and clarification, while always \nseparating clearly the original text, their additions based on the author\u2019s material, and \ntheir own interpretations. The profession owes them a debt of gratitude for making \nBacharach\u2019s thinking publicly available. That aspects of his theory can be criticised \nshould not distract from the value of an original approach. Coordination and cooperation \nare topics of fundamental importance in social science, and Bacharach\u2019s ideas merit to be \nfurther explored. \n \nThe London School of Economics                                                                J\u00d6RN ROTHE \n"}
