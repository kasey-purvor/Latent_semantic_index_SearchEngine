Introduction. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a possible\nstrategy for the control of an infestation of wood boring beetles in which the larvae\nare burrowed deep in the wood of trees so that they are well protected from natural\nenemies but still have some intrinsic death rate. Our model also incorporates removal\nof trees that have been diagnosed as infested. Our work has been motivated in large\npart by recent infestations in parts of the US and Canada of Anoplophora glabripennis,\ncommonly known as the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), which attacks hardwood\ntrees. Maple, willow, and elm constitute especially good hosts. Birch, ash, poplar, and\nnumerous other tree species can also host this pest. The ALB has been intercepted at\nports and warehouses all over North America, and it is believed that the pest entered\nthe US (later spreading to Canada) in wooden packing crates used for imports from\nChina. The beetle is native to China and Korea, and in China has caused major\ndamage to poplar plantations with signi\ufb01cant economic loss [6]. So far in North\nAmerica the pest has a\ufb00ected only urban and suburban areas, but the potential\nimpact of the ALB on the millions of acres of hardwood forests in the US and Canada\ncould be devastating. It has been estimated that 1.2 billion trees could be at risk if\nthe ALB were to become established in North America (see Nowak et al. [13] for a\nfurther discussion of the potential impact). Since the ALB species is not native to\nNorth America, it has no known natural enemies there (in fact, even in China it has\nfew natural enemies).\n\u2217Received by the editors November 8, 2006; accepted for publication (in revised form) March 17,\n2008; published electronically June 25, 2008.

Since then, the species has been found infesting trees in\nseveral US cities, including New York and Chicago, and it was found in Toronto,\nCanada for the \ufb01rst time in 2003.\nCurrently, the only known e\ufb00ective method of control of the ALB is to cut down,\nchip, and burn infested trees. Chemical controls are of limited potential because the\nlarvae are deep within the tree and no e\ufb00ective chemical controls are yet available,\nthough the e\ufb00ectiveness of certain insecticides is being investigated. It is current\npractice to establish quarantines around known infested areas and to monitor potential\nhost trees within a certain distance of an infested area. Adult beetles are poor \ufb02iers\nbut can \ufb02y short distances up to a few hundred yards to other neighboring trees,\nthough in fact an adult often remains on the same host tree from which it emerged.\nALB infested trees once removed are always replaced with a nonhost species. Other\nmeasures currently used for control include inspection of imports and the imposition\nof regulations on wooden packing material used for imports.\nThe ALB is a large beetle (up to 1.5 in long) which is easy to recognize. Adults\nare active from late spring to fall, when they perish. However, a large proportion of\nthe life cycle of the beetle is spent in the larval stage deep within a tree, and this\nmakes the detection of ALB activity more di\ufb03cult. ALB larval activity on a tree\nis usually spotted either by inspectors or by members of the public. Warning signs\nof a tree being infested include exit holes (typically the diameter of a dime), oozing\nsap, sawdust accumulation, and unseasonable yellowing or drooping of leaves. The\nfemales prefer to lay their eggs in the upper canopy of a tree, though the lower trunk\nand branches can become a\ufb00ected if the upper canopy has been damaged by previous\nALB activity. Preference for the upper canopy means that detection is more likely\nif inspectors are able to inspect it, for example, by climbing the tree. This slows\ndown and increases the expense of systematically searching for ALB in a wooded area\nwith the consequence of trees potentially missing detection. We shall aim to include\nthese factors in the models we present in this paper. Since at present ALB a\ufb00ects\nonly urban or suburban areas of North America, an infested tree probably stands a\nreasonable chance of being diagnosed as such, though possibly not until some time\nafter the laying of eggs. An infested tree, if detected, will always be cut down and\nburned, but if not detected, the tree may survive several more years. Its death in this\ncase will be due to the weakening of the tree and disruption of sap \ufb02ow caused by the\ntunneling due to the larvae.\nAdult ALB of both sexes are promiscuous, mating repeatedly and with di\ufb00erent\npartners, according to greenhouse experiments reported in Morewood et al. [11]. The\nfemale will chew through the bark on the upper trunk and lay an egg. A single female\ncan lay from 35 to 90 eggs during her lifetime of one season. The egg hatches after 1\u20132\nweeks and the larva burrows deep into the tree, where it is very well protected from\nnatural enemies, so there is a high probability of survival to maturity (this probability\ndoes depend to some extent on the tree species; see Morewood et al. [12]). Later in\nits development the larva enters the pupa stage, and \ufb01nally the adult emerges from\nthe tree. The whole duration from egg to adult lasts about one year but can be as\nlong as 18 months. Adult emergence creates visible exit holes, which can sometimes\nbe seen with binoculars, though the holes are not the only or necessarily the earliest\nsign of tree infestation.\nIn our models we shall deal with the issue of infested tree detection by suppos-\ning that there is a time delay \u03c3 between the time a tree becomes infested and the\nsubsequent detection of ALB activity on the tree.

Such a fraction might well be close to 1, if the infestation\nis con\ufb01ned to a small suburban wooded area, but is likely to be much smaller if ALB\ninfestation were to develop in a wilderness area. The models include a second time\ndelay \u03c4 which models the developmental time of the beetle from egg to adult. As we\nshall see, there is a delicate interplay between the two delays \u03c3 and \u03c4 for reasons that\nwill be explained early in the next section.\nSubsection 2.1 deals with the case when \u03c3 < \u03c4 and presents the model for this\ncase together with a detailed derivation. Positivity of solutions is established, which\nis not at all obvious from the appearance of the model equations. Then, su\ufb03cient\nconditions are presented for infestation eradication and a lower bound is given for the\n\ufb01nal number of susceptible trees.\nSubsection 2.2 addresses the case \u03c3 > \u03c4 . The model equations for this case look\nsimilar to those for the \u03c3 < \u03c4 case, but there are subtle di\ufb00erences, and a di\ufb00erent\nstrategy is required to establish positivity of solutions. For this case we again present\nan inequality that is su\ufb03cient for infestation eradication. Subsection 2.3 deals with\nthe case when \u03bb = 1. In subsection 2.4 we present a Laplace transform analysis that\nenables us to calculate analytically the \ufb01nal number of susceptible trees in the case\nwhen the number of adult beetles is small throughout the course of the infestation.\nIn some parameter regimes the infestation is not eradicated but instead all trees\nbecome infested, with the number of susceptible trees tending to zero (we shall see,\nhowever, that if the infestation is eradicated, there are always some trees that escape\ninfestation). In situations in which eradication has not been achieved, the beetle\nnumbers typically evolve to a periodic cycle in a forest in which all trees end up being\ninfested. In reality the goal, of course, is to prevent this from happening and aim\nfor eradication, but without necessarily requiring the detection and removal of every\nsingle infested tree.\n2. Model derivation and analysis. Let Ts(t) and Ti(t) denote, respectively,\nthe numbers of susceptible and infested trees. Trees can survive about 4 years of\ninfestation before they die; this is somewhat longer than the timescale on which we\nwould want to remove infested trees, so disease-induced death of infested trees is\nneglected. It is also reasonable to neglect natural mortality of trees which occurs on\nan even longer timescale (e.g., of 100 years or more for maple trees). The quantities\nL(t) and A(t) denote the numbers of larval and adult beetles.\nThe model we shall develop involves two time delays. We shall let \u03c3 denote the\namount of time that elapses between the instant that a tree becomes infested and the\nsubsequent instant at which there is a probability \u03bb of its being removed and burnt\nas a consequence (i.e., a fraction \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] of trees that become infested are removed\n\u03c3 time units later). We shall let \u03c4 denote the time it takes between the laying of an\negg and subsequent emergence of an adult beetle, i.e., the duration of the larval stage,\nwhich in this paper is understood to include all pre-adult stages. It will be clear that\nthe cases \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03c3 > \u03c4 have to be dealt with separately. For example, if \u03c3 < \u03c4 ,\nthen the period between time of infection of a tree and its subsequent removal (if it\nis removed) is not long enough to allow any larva to mature; however, a larva can\nstill mature if it is fortunate enough to be in a host tree that is not removed. On the\nother hand if \u03c3 > \u03c4 , then it is possible for larvae to complete their development into\nmaturity and escape as adult beetles even if all infested trees are removed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

We justify each equation in (2.1)\u2013\n(2.4) below.\nSusceptible trees are converted to infested trees via contact with adult beetles,\nand it is assumed that the rate at which this occurs is given by the law of mass action\n(equation (2.1)). There is no term re\ufb02ecting regeneration of trees, partly because this\nwould occur on a relatively slow timescale and partly because tree replanting would\nbe of some nonsusceptible species and might not take place at all while the infestation\nis still present.\nThe second term in the right-hand side of (2.2) represents the cutting down (and\nsubsequent burning) of infested trees. It is assumed that when a tree becomes infested,\nit may be recognized and diagnosed as such but only after some time delay \u03c3, which\nmodels the time taken for the tree to begin exhibiting telltale signs. A fraction\n\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] of trees which become infested are later cut down, so that at time t the rate\nof cutting down of infested trees is \u03bb times the infection rate at the earlier time t\u2212\u03c3.\nThe \ufb01rst term in the right-hand side of (2.3) is the birth rate, assumed propor-\ntional to the total number of infested hosts (recall that a tree is considered infested\nafter contact with an adult beetle) and also to B(A(t)), where the function B(\u00b7) is the\nnumber of eggs laid per unit time per tree. We assume that all eggs hatch successfully,\nbut some of the larvae may die in the tree at a rate \u03bcL. Of course, larvae may also die\ndue to trees being cut down and burned. The rate at which this happens is evidently\nrelated to the total cutting down rate of infested and dead trees and is computed as\nfollows:\n\u03bb\u03b2A(t\u2212 \u03c3)Ts(t\u2212 \u03c3)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nrate of tree removal\n\u222b \u03c3\n0\nB(A(t\u2212 a))e\u2212\u03bcLa da\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nlarvae per tree\n.\nThe last term in (2.3), which also appears in (2.4), is the rate at time t at which\nlarvae mature into adult beetles.

Death of adult beetles is modeled by the last term in (2.4).\nTo derive the maturation term for the case when \u03c3 < \u03c4 , let b(t, a) denote the\ndensity of beetles at time t of age a. Larval beetles and adult beetles are, respectively,\nthose of age less than \u03c4 and greater than \u03c4 so that\n(2.5) L(t) =\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nb(t, a) da, A(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\nb(t, a) da.\nIt is larval beetles that are a\ufb00ected by removal of trees, but we must note that, since\nwe assume \u03c3 < \u03c4 here, the larvae that are removed due to tree removal will have age\nup to at most \u03c3. Any older larvae will necessarily be in trees that escaped removal.\nWe model this as follows using von Foerster age-structured equations:\n(2.6)\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202b\n\u2202a\n= \u2212\u03bcLb(t, a)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2A(t\u2212 \u03c3)Ts(t\u2212 \u03c3)B(A(t\u2212 a))e\u2212\u03bcLa, a < \u03c3,\n(2.7)\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202b\n\u2202a\n= \u2212\u03bcLb(t, a), \u03c3 < a < \u03c4.\nThe explanation for the last term in the right-hand side of (2.6) is as follows.

GOURLEY AND XINGFU ZOU\nFor ages a between \u03c3 and \u03c4 , an easier calculation involving (2.7) shows that\nb(t, a) = b(t\u2212 (a\u2212 \u03c3), \u03c3)e\u2212\u03bcL(a\u2212\u03c3),\nand b(t\u2212 (a\u2212 \u03c3), \u03c3) can be found from (2.10) giving that, for \u03c3 \u2264 a \u2264 \u03c4 ,\n(2.11)\nb(t, a) = e\u2212\u03bcLaB(A(t\u2212a))\n[\nTi(t\u2212 a)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b \u03c3\n0\nA(a\u02dc+ t\u2212 a\u2212 \u03c3)Ts(a\u02dc+ t\u2212 a\u2212 \u03c3) da\u02dc\n]\n.\nThis expression looks rather like the corresponding one for a \u2264 \u03c3 (expression (2.10)),\nbut note that the upper limit on the integral is now \u03c3 rather than a. This di\ufb00erence\nis very important. Putting a = \u03c4 into (2.11) gives an expression for b(t, \u03c4), which we\ninsert into (2.9), thereby completing the derivation of (2.4).\nThe expression for b(t, \u03c4) is those larvae of age \u03c4 and represents the rate at which\nlarval beetles become adult beetles (the adult recruitment rate). Expression (2.11)\nwith a = \u03c4 shows that this is basically the birth rate at the earlier time t\u2212\u03c4 (corrected\nfor larval mortality) minus those larvae that would have made it to adulthood but were\nremoved and destroyed with their host tree (the integral term represents accumulated\nremoval of trees that could have hosted the larvae we are discussing, i.e., trees that\nbecame infested at times between t \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3 and t \u2212 \u03c4). An alternative viewpoint is\nthat the term in square brackets in (2.11) (with a = \u03c4) is the \u201ce\ufb00ective\u201d number of\nhost trees at time t\u2212 \u03c4 when the eggs are laid since, in this \u03c3 < \u03c4 regime, those trees\nthat are removed might as well not have been there in the \ufb01rst place.\nThe derivation of the larval equation (2.3) is by di\ufb00erentiation of the expression\nfor L(t) in (2.5), breaking the integral up into the a < \u03c3 and a \u2208 (\u03c3, \u03c4) contributions,\nand using (2.6) and (2.7).\nAs we are considering the \u03c3 < \u03c4 situation, in which it is impossible for a larva\nto complete its development in a tree that gets removed, we should expect that when\n\u03bb = 1 (i.e., every tree that becomes infested is later removed), the maturation rate\nb(t, \u03c4) should be zero. When (and only when) \u03bb = 1, the number of infested trees at\ntime t is given by\nTi(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c3\n\u03b2A(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be.\nTherefore, indeed, b(t, \u03c4) = 0 when \u03bb = 1, for \u03c3 < \u03c4 .\n2.1.1.

For example, the larvae present at time t = 0 are the o\ufb00spring of the\nadults at earlier times, and the modeling described thus far in this paper leads to\nthe expression in (2.12) for L(0). The initial data (2.12) including the compatibility\nconditions is the only ecologically relevant initial data.\nProposition 1. Let \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], and let the initial data for system\n(2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4) satisfy (2.12). Let the birth function be bounded and satisfy\nB(0) = 0 and B(A) > 0 for A > 0. Then all variables in (2.1)\u2013(2.4) are de\ufb01ned for\nall t > 0 and are bounded and remain nonnegative for t > 0.\nProof. Existence of solutions follows by the method of steps which, since \u03c3 < \u03c4\nhere, is carried out successively on the steps t \u2208 [0, \u03c3], t \u2208 [\u03c3, 2\u03c3], etc. It is easily seen\nthat this works on the subsystem consisting of (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4). For example\nwhen t \u2208 [\u03c3, 2\u03c3], all arguments of the delayed variables in (2.4) remain less than \u03c3.\nSo, local existence is assured for Ts(t), Ti(t), and A(t) (global existence will be shown\nlater). It turns out that L(t) has an explicit expression in terms of these variables\n(see (2.17) below). Next we shall show that all variables remain nonnegative for as\nlong as they are de\ufb01ned.\nIt is obvious that Ts(t) \u2265 0 for all t > 0. Next we shall show nonnegativity of\nA(t). This will be achieved by jointly showing nonnegativity of A(t) and the function\nf(t) de\ufb01ned by\n(2.13) f(t) = Ti(t)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c3\nA(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be.\nUsing (2.2) we \ufb01nd that\n(2.14)\ndf\ndt\n= \u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)A(t)Ts(t).\nAlso, (2.4) can be rewritten in a form involving f(t),\n(2.15)\ndA(t)\ndt\n= e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B(A(t\u2212 \u03c4))f(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 \u03bcAA(t).\nAs regards initial conditions for f(t), note that when t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0], from (2.12),\nf(t) = \u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA(t+ \u03be)Ts(t+ \u03be) d\u03be \u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c3\nA(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be\n= (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA(t+ \u03be)Ts(t+ \u03be) d\u03be \u2265 0,(2.16)\nso f(t) is nonnegative initially. The functions f(t) and A(t) can be viewed as satis-\nfying (2.14) and (2.15), considered here as a coupled system in which Ts(t) is some\nknown nonnegative function. The assumptions on B(\u00b7) and the nonnegativity of f(t)\nand A(t) for t \u2264 0 allow us to deduce, from Theorem 2.1 on page 81 of Smith [16],\nthat f(t) \u2265 0 and A(t) \u2265 0 for all t > 0.\nFrom (2.2),\ndTi(t)\ndt\n= \u03b2A(t)Ts(t)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2A(t\u2212 \u03c3)Ts(t\u2212 \u03c3)\n\u2265 \u03b2A(t)Ts(t)\u2212 \u03b2A(t\u2212 \u03c3)Ts(t\u2212 \u03c3) = d\ndt\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c3\n\u03b2A(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

The solution of (2.3) subject to the com-\npatibility condition in (2.12) is most easily found from (2.5) with (2.10) and (2.11)\nand turns out to be\n(2.17)\nL(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nB(A(\u03be))e\u2212\u03bcL(t\u2212\u03be)Ti(\u03be) d\u03be\n\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b \u03c3\n0\n\u222b t\u2212a\nt\u2212\u03c4\nB(A(\u03be))A(a+ \u03be \u2212 \u03c3)Ts(a+ \u03be \u2212 \u03c3)e\u2212\u03bcL(t\u2212\u03be) d\u03be da.\nIndeed, the most general solution of (2.3), which is linear in L(t), is the above expres-\nsion plus C exp(\u2212\u03bcLt) for some constant C, and the latter term would have to be set\nto zero to satisfy (2.12). The state space of initial data in (2.12) is forward invariant\nin this sense.\nUsing (2.13) and nonnegativity of f(t), it can be shown that\nL(t) \u2265\n\u222b \u03c3\n0\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03be\u00af\nB(A(\u03be))A(\u03be\u00af + \u03be \u2212 \u03c3)Ts(\u03be\u00af + \u03be \u2212 \u03c3)e\u2212\u03bcL(t\u2212\u03be) d\u03be d\u03be\u00af.\nHence L(t) \u2265 0. Having shown nonnegativity of each solution variable while it is\nde\ufb01ned, we may now establish global existence. This can be done by establishing a\npriori bounds. Indeed, nonnegativity of the variables and (2.1) imply that Ts(t) is\ndecreasing, so that Ts(t) is bounded above and below. Since df\/dTs = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03bb), it\nfollows that f(t) is also bounded above and below. It then follows from (2.15), using\nboundedness of B(\u00b7), that A(t) is bounded. Then (2.13) implies that Ti(t) is bounded.\nThen expression (2.17) shows that L(t) is bounded and the proof is complete.\n2.1.2. Infestation eradication. In this section we present conditions on the\nparameters which guarantee that for initial data satisfying (2.12) in section 2.1.1 the\ninfestation is eradicated.\nTheorem 1. Let \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], and let the initial data for system\n(2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4) satisfy (2.12).

Inequality (2.18) essentially arises from the worst imaginable (but\nnot actually attainable) scenario in which the entire forest becomes infested before\nthe infestation is eradicated. If the infestation is successfully eradicated, there will\nalways be some trees that escape infestation, and (2.19) gives a lower bound for this\nnumber of escaped trees. However, in the proof of the theorem we are faced with the\ndi\ufb03culty that the number Ts(\u221e) is not known exactly. We need an upper bound for\nthe function f(t) de\ufb01ned by (2.13) involving only known quantities, and in achieving\nthis we are forced to use Ts(\u221e) \u2265 0 so that we are e\ufb00ectively considering an extreme\nbut unattained situation. The quantity Ts(0)+\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3 A\n0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be is the total initial\nnumber of trees (susceptible and infested), all of which would end up infested in this\nworst case scenario. But a fraction 1\u2212 \u03bb of them is not removed. The left-hand side\nof (2.18) is the per capita maturation rate at large times, being the per capita egg\nlaying rate per tree B\u2032(0), multiplied by the number of infested trees at large times\ncorrected for tree removal, multiplied by the survival probability e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4 .\nProof of Theorem 1. From (2.1) and nonnegativity of solutions, Ts(t) is a decreas-\ning nonnegative function which therefore approaches a nonnegative limit as t\u2192\u221e.\nRecall the function f(t) de\ufb01ned by (2.13). From (2.1) and (2.14) note that\ndf\ndTs\n= \u2212(1\u2212 \u03bb).\nHence\nf(t) = \u2212(1\u2212 \u03bb)Ts(t) + Ti(0)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be + (1\u2212 \u03bb)Ts(0).\nSince Ts(t) \u2265 0,\nf(t) \u2264 Ti(0)\u2212 \u03bb\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be + (1\u2212 \u03bb)Ts(0)\n= (1\u2212 \u03bb)\n[\nTs(0) + \u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be\n]\nusing (2.12).\nUsing the form of (2.4) involving f(t) (i.e., (2.15)) and the above upper bound for\nf(t), we obtain\n(2.20)\ndA(t)\ndt\n\u2264 (1\u2212 \u03bb)e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B(A(t\u2212 \u03c4))\n(\nTs(0) + \u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be\n)\n\u2212 \u03bcAA(t)\n\u2264 (1\u2212 \u03bb)e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B\u2032(0)A(t\u2212 \u03c4)\n(\nTs(0) + \u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c3\nA0(\u03be)T 0s (\u03be) d\u03be\n)\n\u2212 \u03bcAA(t).\nSince the right-hand side of this is increasing as a function of the delayed variable\nA(t \u2212 \u03c4), we may say that A(t) is bounded above by the solution of the di\ufb00erential\nequation obtained by replacing \u201c\u2264\u201d by \u201c=\u201d and satisfying the same initial data as\nthat for A (see, e.g., Theorem 1.1 on page 78 of Smith [16]). By a straightforward\nand standard argument involving the characteristic equation of the resulting linear\ndelay equation, utilizing Theorem 5.1 on page 92 of Smith [16] to assure ourselves\nthat the dominant eigenvalue is real, we conclude that A(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e under\nthe hypothesis (2.18).

If \u03c3 > \u03c4 , then the maturation time for a larva is less than\nthe time that elapses between a tree becoming infested and its possible subsequent\nremoval \u03c3 time units later. Thus, if an egg is laid on a particular tree just after that\ntree became infested, then that larva is not at risk of having its host tree removed\nand burned. If an egg is laid on a tree that became infested some time ago, such\nthat the tree now has less than \u03c4 time units to go before the time at which there is a\nprobability \u03bb of its being removed, that larva could still survive to maturation if its\nhost is not actually removed.

The case \u03bb = 1. In this subsection we discuss the situation when \u03bb = 1,\nwhich means that every tree that becomes infested is removed \u03c3 time units later. We\nshall deal with both of the cases \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03c3 > \u03c4 . In either case, the expression\n(2.33) Ti(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c3\n\u03b2A(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be\nis available to us, though the implications of this fact for the cases \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03c3 > \u03c4\nare di\ufb00erent. Expression (2.33) gives us the total number of infested trees at time\nt, which, when \u03bb = 1, is simply the accumulation of all new infestations over the\nprevious \u03c3 units of time (the corresponding expression for Ti(t) when \u03bb \u0007= 1 appears\nlater (expression (2.39)) and in this case includes trees that became infested before\ntime t\u2212 \u03c3 but escaped detection).\nIn the case \u03c3 < \u03c4 the use of expression (2.33) in (2.4) yields A\u2032(t) = \u2212\u03bcAA(t)\nso that A(t) \u2192 0, and the infestation is eradicated. This is hardly surprising since if\nevery infested tree is removed \u03c3 time units after the time of infestation, and \u03c3 < \u03c4 ,\nthen no larva is being given enough time to mature.\nIf \u03c3 > \u03c4 , the equation for A(t) is (2.24), and the use of (2.33) leads to\n(2.34)\ndA(t)\ndt\n= e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B(A(t\u2212 \u03c4))\n\u222b t\u2212\u03c4\nt\u2212\u03c3\n\u03b2A(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be \u2212 \u03bcAA(t).\nWe will use this equation to show that the infestation is always eradicated when\n\u03bb = 1, regardless of the values of \u03c3 and \u03c4 . The truth of this result even in the \u03c3 > \u03c4\ncase is a little surprising, since this case o\ufb00ers the possibility of some larvae maturing\nbefore their host tree is destroyed. However, numerical simulations do show that even\nthough eradication is still the \ufb01nal outcome, there may be a long transient in which\nthe infestation grows worse for a while before dying out.\nTheorem 3. Let \u03bb = 1, and consider the system consisting of either (2.1)\u2013(2.4)\nor (2.21)\u2013(2.24), with initial data satisfying (2.12) with Ts(0) > 0 and A(0) > 0. Let\nthe birth function satisfy B(0) = 0 and 0 < B(A) \u2264 B\u2032(0)A for A > 0. Then the\ninfestation is eradicated, that is, (Ti(t), L(t), A(t)) \u2192 (0, 0, 0) as t\u2192\u221e.\nProof. It is su\ufb03cient to show that A(t) \u2192 0. Then L(t) \u2192 0 follows trivially\nfrom (2.3) or (2.23) as appropriate, and Ti(t) \u2192 0 follows from (2.33). We have\nalready commented above that if \u03c3 < \u03c4 , then A(t) \u2192 0 trivially; this can be extended\nto \u03c3 = \u03c4 . So it remains to consider the case \u03c3 > \u03c4 , and it is here that we shall\nmake use of (2.34), which has to be coupled to (2.21). The latter equation, together\nwith nonnegativity of solutions, implies that Ts(t) must decay monotonically to some\nnonnegative limit as t \u2192 \u221e. If Ts(t) \u2192 0, then the asymptotic limit of (2.34) is\njust A\u2032(t) = \u2212\u03bcAA(t), and so A(t) \u2192 0.

The proof is complete.\n2.4. Approximation of Ts(\u221e). In subsections 2.1 and 2.2 we have seen that,\nunder the eradication condition (2.18) for system (2.1)\u2013(2.4), or condition (2.31) for\nsystem (2.21)\u2013(2.24), the infestation is eradicated and the beetle does not a\ufb00ect the\nentire forest, since A(t) \u2192 0 and Ts(t) \u2192 Ts(\u221e) =: T \u2217s > 0. Lower bounds for T \u2217s are\nprovided by inequalities (2.19) and (2.32) for models (2.1)\u2013(2.4) and (2.21)\u2013(2.24), re-\nspectively. In this subsection we provide an approach for obtaining an approximation\nfor T \u2217s . We present our analysis only for (2.21)\u2013(2.24); the analysis for (2.1)\u2013(2.4) is\nsimilar.\nIt is easily seen using (2.26) that the function\nt\u2192 g(t)\u2212\n\u222b t\nt\u2212(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)\n\u03b2A(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be\nis increasing for all t \u2265 0. But (2.30) implies that this function is bounded from\nabove. Therefore, it has a limit as t \u2192 \u221e, and thus g(t) also has a limit as t \u2192 \u221e,\nsince we consider the situation in which A(t) \u2192 0. It follows from (2.25) that T \u2217i :=\nlimt\u2192\u221e Ti(t) also exists and T \u2217i = limt\u2192\u221e g(t). Now, when t is su\ufb03ciently large, A(t)\nbecomes very small, and hence we may study the linearized approximation of (2.27)\nfor small A(t), and also replace g(t \u2212 \u03c4) by its (as yet undetermined) limiting value\nT \u2217i as t\u2192\u221e to obtain\n(2.37)\ndA(t)\ndt\n= e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B\u2032(0)T \u2217i A(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 \u03bcAA(t).\nLetting p be the transform variable, the Laplace transform A\u00af(p) of A(t) is\nA\u00af(p) =\nA0(0) + e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4T \u2217i B\n\u2032(0)e\u2212p\u03c4\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\nA0(\u03be)e\u2212p\u03be d\u03be\np\u2212 e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4T \u2217i B\u2032(0)e\u2212p\u03c4 + \u03bcA\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

Furthermore, this dominant eigenvalue is negative,\nsince we consider the situation when A(t) \u2192 0, so let it be \u2212p\u2217(T \u2217i ), to emphasize the\ndependence on T \u2217i , with p\n\u2217(T \u2217i ) > 0. This dominant eigenvalue is also the singularity\nof A\u00af(p) of greatest real part. By the inversion formula for Laplace transforms, A(t)\ncan be expressed as a contour integral, which by Cauchy\u2019s residue formula can be\nevaluated as a sum of residues of the poles of A\u00af(p).

We have carried out some numerical simulations\nof our model for both the \u03c3 < \u03c4 and \u03c3 > \u03c4 situations. Fortunately, the alternative\nformulations of the two systems in terms of the functions f(t) and g(t) make the sys-\ntems easily amenable to simulation using standard software tools for delay equations\nincluding those found within MATLAB.\nFor the \u03c3 < \u03c4 situation described in subsection 2.1, we simulate the system of\nthree equations consisting of (2.1), (2.14), and (2.15). Note that one of the delays,\n\u03c3, is not explicitly present in this system. However, \u03c3 plays a role through the\nformula (2.16), which is used to compute the initial data for the variable f from\nthat for A and Ts. We measure time in months, so \u03c4 = 12, corresponding to the\nmaturation time of one year. We chose the birth rate function B(A) to have the form\nB(A) = bmAe\n\u2212aA, a common choice in the mathematical study of insect infestations,\nbecause it re\ufb02ects the decreasing per capita egg laying rate due to crowding. In this\nformula the quantity bm is the egg laying rate per female adult beetle per tree at\nlower densities without the e\ufb00ects of crowding. We assumed that a single female\nlays on average about 60 eggs during her life (though estimates vary considerably).\nShe is active only in summer, but we average over a year to arrive at a \ufb01gure of\n5 eggs per female per month. Good data on the survival probability for the larvae\nare not available, but by being deep inside the trees the larvae are well protected\nfrom predators, so if we assume a survival probability of about 0.8, this leads to\n\u03bcL = 0.0186. Values for other parameters are shown in the \ufb01gures. Figures 1 and 2\nillustrate two situations in which \u03c3 < \u03c4 . In Figure 1 the infestation is eradicated,\nwhereas in Figure 2 (in which we used a lower number for the probability \u03bb of an\ninfested tree being detected and removed) the number of susceptible trees tends to\nzero and the entire forest ends up infested, with the number of adult beetles tending\nto a constant. Other simulations showed a similar outcome but with the number of\nadults evolving to a periodic cycle. We also noted from our numerical experiments\nthat (2.18) does not appear to be the best possible condition for eradication (i.e., it\nis su\ufb03cient but not necessary).\nFor the \u03c3 > \u03c4 situation of subsection 2.2, the appropriate system to simulate is\nthat consisting of (2.21), (2.26), and (2.27). This system involves both delays \u03c3 and\n\u03c4 explicitly, with initial data for g calculated from that for A and Ts using (2.25)\nand the initial data formula for Ti in (2.12). Figure 3 shows a simulation for the\n\u03c3 > \u03c4 situation in which the time between tree infestation and tree removal is a little\nlonger than the time taken for a larva to complete its development and mature as an\nadult beetle. One expects that it will be more di\ufb03cult to achieve eradication. The\nsimulation shows that it is still possible to do so, but only by detecting and removing\n95% of infested trees. Figure 4 shows a situation with \u03bb = 1, i.e., every infested\ntree is later destroyed, but with \u03c3 chosen to be considerably larger than \u03c4 , so that\nmany larvae can complete their maturation and emerge as adults even though their\nhost tree is doomed. With \u03bb = 1, eradication is the \ufb01nal outcome (Theorem 3) even\nthough \u03c3 > \u03c4 , but the simulation shows a large and destructive transient, with very\nfew susceptible trees remaining after the infestation has died out.\n4. Discussion. We have derived a mathematical model to describe the infesta-\ntion of wood boring beetles with the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) as a prototype.\nTwo delays are needed for the model. One of these delays, denoted by \u03c3, is the av-\nerage duration between the time a tree becomes infested and the time the infestation\nin the tree is detected and the tree removed. The second delay is the maturation\ndelay \u03c4 for the beetle.

Solving (2.18) for \u03bb gives\nan explicit requirement on \u03bb. In the case \u03c3 > \u03c4 , detection of infestation in a tree is\nnot happening quickly enough and it may be possible for a beetle larva to complete its\nmaturation even in a tree destined for removal, especially if the larva hatched from an\negg that was laid soon after the tree became infested. The corresponding model (2.21)\u2013\n(2.24) is more di\ufb03cult to analyze, but nevertheless a condition (namely, (2.31)) for\neradication of the infestation can be obtained. However, it is more di\ufb03cult to satisfy\nthe condition. Indeed, if\n(4.1) e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B\u2032(0)\n[\n\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)\nA(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be + Ts(0)\n]\n< \u03bcA,\nthen (2.31) will hold if \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] is chosen su\ufb03ciently close to 1. But if (4.1) does not\nhold, that is,\n(4.2) e\u2212\u03bcL\u03c4B\u2032(0)\n[\n\u03b2\n\u222b 0\n\u2212(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)\nA(\u03be)Ts(\u03be) d\u03be + Ts(0)\n]\n\u2265 \u03bcA,\nthen condition (2.31) is never satis\ufb01ed regardless of the value of \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], although\nwe do know from Theorem 3 that the infestation is nevertheless eradicated if \u03bb = 1.\nTo understand the di\ufb00erence between conditions (2.18) and (2.31), note that con-\ndition (2.31) relates to the \u03c3 > \u03c4 situation, in which the timescale for infestation\ndetection in a tree is longer than the maturation time for the beetle. Naturally, we\nshould expect that infestation eradication should be more di\ufb03cult in the \u03c3 > \u03c4 sit-\nuation than in the \u03c3 < \u03c4 situation in which, if a tree is found to be infested, then\nits destruction happens su\ufb03ciently quickly so that a larva cannot mature in it. In\nthe \u03c3 > \u03c4 situation it will be possible for some larvae to mature even in a host tree\ndestined for removal.\nNote that \u03c3 and \u03bb are the only parameters in the model that are within our\ncontrol. For example, \u03c3 could be decreased by the use of high technology acoustic\ndetectors that can detect larval activity in a tree, and \u03bb, which e\ufb00ectively measures the\nlikelihood of ALB activity being detected in a tree, can be raised by increasing public\nawareness of the telltale signs of tree infestation. Another related beetle species in\nJapan has been controlled by the use of fungal bands which contain cultures of insect\npathogenic fungi, and there have been trials of the technique on the ALB in Anhui,\nChina (see Hajek et al. [7]). The fungal bands are placed at an approximate height\nof 2\u20132.5 m around the trees and infect the adult beetles, which can then transfer the\ninfection during mating, leading to a reduced number of viable eggs. The e\ufb00ectiveness\nof the technique can be augmented by the use of a chemical attractant. On the use\nof entomopathogenic nematodes, see also Qin et al. [14].\nNone of the abovementioned measures is likely to be of much value if ALB were\nto take hold in wilderness areas. This, of course, highlights the importance of ensur-\ning that the ALB does not become established in North America. Some studies of\nKeena [8] on the dependence of ALB activity on temperature suggests that the lower\n48 states should be able to support beetle survival and reproduction.

Nevertheless the \ufb01nal outcome is\nstill eradication, though only after a very destructive transient in which the infestation gets worse.\nNote that the \ufb01nal number of susceptible trees is very low, indicating severe destruction of the forest\nduring the course of the infestation.\nB(A) = B\u2032(\u03b8)A \u2264 BmA, where Bm = sup\u03b8\u22650 B\u2032(\u03b8).

The\ninvasion of the ALB from Asia to North America is believed to have been via the\nuse of wooden packing crates and wood products which may contain individuals in\npremature stages (eggs, larvae, or pupae). This no doubt accounts for the long range\ntransport between continents and between di\ufb00erent districts. Short range dispersal of\nadult beetles could possibly be modeled, as a \ufb01rst approximation, by the incorporation\nof Fickian di\ufb00usion. However, the actual dispersal behavior of the ALB is not so\nstraightforward, and some experimental work reported in Bancroft and Smith [1]\nsuggests a dependence on beetle density, weather conditions, beetle size and tree size,\nand that a thorough knowledge of dispersal behavior will be bene\ufb01cial to eradication\ne\ufb00orts. Release of the ALB is prohibited in the US, so there is little experimental\nwork documented, but there have been detailed mark and release studies in Gansu\nProvince, China (Smith et al. [17]) at a site chosen for its landscape similarities to\nthose of urban infestations in the US. These studies suggest that dispersal depends on\nthe spacing of suitable host trees, the age of the beetles, availability of host material,\nand crowding on suitable trees.\nA great deal of mathematical work has been carried out on the dispersal behavior\nof beetles and insect species more generally (see Shigesada and Kawasaki [15], and\nKot, Lewis, and van den Driessche [9]), but not speci\ufb01cally on the ALB. In fact, in\nour future work on the ALB we are considering the use of integrodi\ufb00erence equations\nthat are continuous in space but discrete in time, since the ALB seems to follow a\npredictable pattern in nonnative habitats of having one generation per year. Discrete\ntime models have been commonly used in the past to model beetle populations. The\n\ufb02our beetle tribolium has been particularly well studied due to its high rates of repro-\nduction, short life cycle (4 to 6 weeks from egg to adult), ease of culture, and strong\ncannibalistic tendencies, which make the beetle suitable for laboratory studies (see\nCostantino and Desharnais [3]). These characteristics do imply that tribolium is very\ndi\ufb00erent from the ALB. Cannibalism in particular can a\ufb00ect all pre-adult stages of\ntribolium, including even some callow (not fully sclerotized) adults (see Mertz [10]).\nCostantino et al. [4] compared the results of laboratory studies with the predic-\ntions of a discrete time model incorporating, unlike the present study, two pre-adult\ncompartments. In the laboratory studies, adult mortality could be manipulated by\nremoving or adding adults, and recruitment by removing or adding younger adults.\nUnder conditions of high adult mortality, quasi-periodic cycles and chaos were ob-\nserved in the laboratory populations and in the model predictions.\nIt seems unlikely that a continuous time model such as the one we present here\ncould work satisfactorily for beetle species which have complex dynamics. Discrete\ntime models might in principle be able to address the issue of complex dynamics, but\nthese models have their limitations too. For example, western pine beetle populations\ncan be asynchronous and indistinguishably overlapped because of di\ufb00erential brood\ndevelopment rates in di\ufb00erent trees (see DeMars et al. [5]).\nWhen it comes to modeling the eradication of infestation by removal strategy, we\nmay have to consider di\ufb00usion of adults which depends on the removal strength (i.e.,\nthe parameter \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]), since when an infected tree is cut, the adult beetles in that\ntree will all \ufb02y to the neighboring trees. In other words, the removal of infested trees\nwill enhance the di\ufb00usion of the adults. This will make modeling a more interesting\nyet more challenging job. We leave such problems for future investigation.\nAcknowledgments.
