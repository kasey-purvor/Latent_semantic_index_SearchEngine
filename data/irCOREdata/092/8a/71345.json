INTRODUCTION\nMost real systems are nonlinear and complex. In general,\nthey may be regarded as a set of interacting subsystems;\ngiven their nonlinearity, the interactions can be expected to\nbe nonlinear too.\nThe phase relationships between a pair of interacting os-\ncillators can be obtained from bivariate data ~i.e., where the\ncoordinate of each oscillator can be measured separately! by\nuse of the methods recently developed for analysis of syn-\nchronization, or generalized synchronization, between cha-\notic and\/or noisy systems. Not only can the interactions be\ndetected @1#, but their strength and direction can also be de-\ntermined @2#. The next logical step in studying the interac-\ntions among coupled oscillators must be to determine the\nnature of the couplings: the methods developed for synchro-\nnization analysis are not capable of answering this question.\nStudies of higher-order spectra, or polyspectra, offer a\npromising way forward. The approach is applicable to inter-\nacting systems quite generally, regardless of whether or not\nthey are mutually synchronized. Following the pioneering\nwork of Brillinger and Rosenblatt @3#, increasing applica-\ntions of polyspectra in a diversity of fields have appeared,\ne.g., telecommunications, radar, sonar, speech, biomedical,\ngeophysics, imaging systems, surface gravity waves, acous-\ntics, econometrics, seismology, nondestructive testing,\noceanography, plasma physics, and seismology. An extensive\noverview can be found in Ref. @4#. The use of the bispectrum\nas a means of investigating the presence of second-order\nnonlinearity in interacting harmonic oscillators has been of\nparticular interest during the last few years @5\u20138#.\nSystems are usually taken to be stationary. For real sys-\ntems, however, the mutual interaction among subsystems of-\n*Electronic address: janez.jamsek@pef.uni-lj.si\n\u2020Electronic address: aneta@osc.fe.uni-lj.si\n\u2021 Electronic address: p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u00a7 Electronic address: igor@chaos.ssu.runnet.ru1063-651X\/2003\/68~1!\/016201~12!\/$20.00 68 0162ten results in time variability of their characteristic frequen-\ncies. Frequency and phase couplings can occur temporally,\nand the strength of coupling between pairs of individual os-\ncillators may change with time. In studying such systems,\nbispectral analysis for stationary signals, based on time av-\nerages, is no longer sufficient. Rather, the time evolution of\nthe bispectral estimates is needed.\nPriestley and Gabr @9# were probably the first to introduce\nthe time-dependent bispectrum for harmonic oscillators.\nMost of the subsequent work has been related to the time-\nfrequency representation and is based on high-order cumu-\nlants @10#. The parametric approach has been used to obtain\napproximate expressions for the evolutionary bispectrum\n@11#. Further, Perry and Amin have proposed a recursion\nmethod for estimating the time-dependent bispectrum @12#.\nDandawate\u00b4 and Giannakis have defined estimators for cyclic\nand time-varying moments and cumulants of cyclostationary\nsignals @13#. Schack et al. @14# have recently introduced a\ntime-varying spectral method for estimating the bispectrum\nand bicoherence: the estimates are obtained by filtering in the\nfrequency domain and then obtaining a complex time-\nfrequency signal by inverse Fourier transform. They assume,\nhowever, that the interacting oscillators are harmonic.\nMillingen et al. @15# introduced the wavelet bicoherence\nand were the first to demonstrate the use of bispectra for\nstudying interactions among nonlinear oscillators. They used\nthe method to detect periodic and chaotic interactions be-\ntween two coupled van der Pol oscillators, but without con-\ncentrating on time-phase relationships, in particular.\nIn this paper we develop an approach @16# that introduces\ntime dependance to the bispectral analysis of univariate data.\nWe focus on the time-phase relationships between two ~or\nmore! interacting systems. As we demonstrate below, the\nmethod enables us to detect that two or more subsystems are\ninteracting with each other, to quantify the strength of the\ninteraction, and to determine its nature, whether additive lin-\near or quadratic, or parametric in one of the frequencies. It\nyields results that are applicable quite generally to any sys-\ntem of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Our principal motiva-\u00a92003 The American Physical Society01-1\nJAMS\u02c7EK et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 016201 ~2003!tion has been to develop a technique for studying the human\ncardiovascular system @17#, including the interactions among\nits subsystems, and the nature of these interactions. Here,\nhowever, we are concerned with basic principles, and in\ndemonstrating ~testing! the technique on a well-characterized\nsimple model. Application to the more challenging problem\nposed by the cardiovascular system, currently in progress,\nwill be described in a subsequent publication.\nII. METHOD\nA. Bispectral analysis\nBispectral analysis belongs to a group of techniques based\non high-order statistics ~HOS! that may be used to analyze\nnon-Gaussian signals, to obtain phase information, to sup-\npress Gaussian noise of unknown spectral form, and to detect\nand characterize signal nonlinearities @5#. In what follows we\nextend bispectral analysis to extract useful features from\nnonstationary data, and we demonstrate the modified tech-\nnique by application to test signals generated from coupled\noscillators.\nThe bispectrum involves third-order statistics. Spectral es-\ntimation is based on the conventional Fourier type direct\napproach, through computation of the third-order moments\nwhich, in the case of third-order statistics, are equivalent to\nthird-order cumulants @5,18\u201321#.\nThe classical bispectrum estimate is obtained as an aver-\nage of estimated third-order moments ~cumulants! M\u02c6 3\ni (k ,l),\nB\u02c6 ~k ,l !5\n1\nK (i51\nK\nM\u02c6 3\ni ~k ,l !, ~1!\nwhere the third-order moment estimate M\u02c6 3\ni (k ,l) is performed\nby a triple product of discrete Fourier transforms ~DFTs! at\ndiscrete frequencies k, l, and k1l:\nM\u02c6 3\ni ~k ,l !5Xi~k !Xi~ l !Xi*~k1l !, ~2!\nwith i51, . . . ,K segments into which the signal is divided\nto try to obtain statistical stability of the estimates, see the\nAppendix.\nJust as the discrete power spectrum has a point of sym-\nmetry at the folding frequency f s\/2, the discrete bispectrum\nhas many symmetries in the (k ,l) plane @22#. Because of\nthese, it is necessary to calculate the bispectrum only in the\nnonredundant region, or principal domain, as shown in Fig.\n1. The principal domain can be divided into two triangular\nregions in which the discrete bispectrum has different prop-\nerties: the inner triangle ~IT! and the outer one @23#. In the\ncurrent work it is the IT that is of primary interest. Thus, it is\nsufficient to calculate the bispectrum over the IT of the prin-\ncipal domain defined in Refs. @5,7#: 0<l<k , k1l< f s\/2.\nThe bispectrum B(k ,l) is a complex quantity, defined by\nmagnitude A and phase f ,\nB~k ,l !5uB~k ,l !ue j\/B(k ,l)5Ae jf. ~3!\nConsequently, for each (k ,l), its value can be represented as\na point in a complex space, Re@B(k ,l)# versus Im@B(k ,l)# ,01620thus defining a vector. Its magnitude ~length! is known as the\nbiamplitude. The phase, which for the bispectrum is called\nthe biphase, is determined by the angle between the vector\nand the positive real axis.\nThe bispectrum quantifies the relationships among the un-\nderlying oscillatory components of the observed signals.\nSpecifically, bispectral analysis examines the relationships\nbetween the oscillations at two basic frequencies, k and l, and\na harmonic component at the frequency k1l . This set of\nthree frequencies is known as a triplet (k ,l ,k1l). The\nbispectrum B(k ,l), a quantity incorporating both phase and\npower information, can be calculated for each triplet.\nA high bispectrum value at bifrequency (k ,l) indicates\nthat there is at least frequency coupling within the triplet of\nfrequencies k, l, and k6l . Strong coupling implies that the\noscillatory components at k and l may have a common gen-\nerator. Such components may synthesize a new component at\nthe combinatorial frequency k6l if a quadratic nonlinearity\nis present.\nB. Time-phase bispectral analysis\nThe classical bispectral method is adequate for studying\nstationary signals whose frequency content is preserved over\ntime. We now wish to encompass time dependance within\nthe bispectral analysis. In analogy with the short-time Fou-\nrier transform, we accomplish this by moving a time window\nw(n) of length M across the signal x(n), calculating the\nDFT at each window position\nX~k ,n !>\n1\nM (n50\nM21\nx~n !w~n2t!e2 j2pnk\/M . ~4!\nHere, k is the discrete frequency, n the discrete time, and t\nthe time shift. The choice of window length M is a compro-\nmise between achieving optimal frequency resolution and\noptimal detection of the time variability. The instantaneous\nbiphase is then calculated: from Eqs. ~2! and ~3!, it is\nf~k ,l ,n !5fk~n !1f l~n !2fk1l~n !. ~5!\nFIG. 1.

For our purposes the phase coupling is less\nstrict because dependent frequency components can be phase\ndelayed. We consider phase coupling to exist if the biphase is\nconstant ~but not necessarily50 radians! for at least several\nperiods of the lowest frequency component. Simultaneously,\nwe observe the instantaneous biamplitude from which it is\npossible to infer the relative strength of the interaction. We\nthus hope to be able to observe the presence and persistence\nof coupling among the oscillators.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nTo illustrate the essence of the method, and to test it, we\nuse a generic model of interacting systems whose basic unit\nis the Poincare\u00b4 oscillator:\nx\u02d9 i52xiqi2v iy i1gxi,\ny\u02d9 i52yiqi1v ix i1gyi, ~6!\nqi5a i~Axi21yi22ai!.\nHere x and y are vectors of the oscillator state variables, a i ,\nai and v i are constants, and gy(y) and gx(x) are coupling\nvectors. The activity of each subsystem is described by the\ntwo state variables xi and yi , where i51, . . . ,N denotes the\nsubsystem.\nThe form of the coupling terms can be adjusted to study\ndifferent kinds of interaction among the subsystems, e.g.,\nadditive linear or quadratic, or parametric frequency modu-\nlation. Examples will be considered both without and with a\nzero-mean white Gaussian noise to obtain more realistic con-\nditions.01620Different cases of interaction are demonstrated for signals\ngenerated by the proposed model. In each case we analyze\nthe x1 variable of the first oscillator, recorded as a continuous\ntime series. For the first 400 s, the interoscillator coupling\nstrength was zero. It was then raised to a small constant\nvalue. After a further 400 s, it was increased again. The first\n15 s and corresponding power spectrum for each coupling\nstrength are shown in the figures for each test signal, in order\nto demonstrate the changes in spectral content and behavior\ncaused by the coupling. For bispectral analysis the whole\nsignal is analyzed as a single entity, but the transients caused\nby the changes in coupling strength are removed prior to\nprocessing. First the classical bispectrum is estimated. Bifre-\nquencies where peaks provide evidence of possible fre-\nquency interactions are then further studied by the calcula-\ntion of the biphase and biamplitude as functions of time.\nThey were calculated using a window of length 100 s, moved\nacross the signal in 0.3 s steps.\nA. Linear couplings\nLet us start with the simplest case of a linear interaction\nbetween coupled oscillators. We suppose model ~6! to consist\nof only two oscillators, i51,2. The parameters of the model\nare set to a151, a150.5 and a2 ,a251. The coupling term\nis unidirectional and linear\ngx15h2x2 , gy15h2y2 . ~7!\nThe test signal x1A(t) is the variable x1 of the first oscillator.\nIt is presented in Fig. 2~a! with the corresponding power\nspectrum for three different coupling strengths: no coupling\nh250 and weak couplings h250.1,0.2. The peaks labeled\nas f 151.1 Hz and f 250.24 Hz are the independent har-\nmonic components of the first and the second oscillator.\nThese frequencies are deliberately chosen to approximately\nhave a noninteger ratio. There is also at least one peak1-3\nJAMS\u02c7EK et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 016201 ~2003!FIG. 3. ~a!

It arises\nfrom the nonlinearity of the first oscillator, but is caused by\nthe forcing of the second oscillator.\nThe principal domain of the bispectrum for the test signal\nx1A , Fig. 2~d!, shows one peak at the bifrequency ~1.1 Hz,\n1.1 Hz!, the so-called self-coupling. No other peaks are\npresent. Bispectral analysis examines the relationships be-\ntween oscillations at the two basic frequencies f 1 and f 2 ,\nand a modulation component at the frequency f 16 f 2, which\nis absent from the power spectra in Fig. 2~b!. Therefore, no\npeak is present at bifrequency ~1.1 Hz,0.24 Hz!. Thus, the\nmethod as it stands is incapable of detecting the presence of\nlinear coupling between the oscillators by analysis of the test\nsignal x1A . Nonetheless, we still suggest the use of bispec-\ntral analysis to investigate the presence of nonlinearity, but\nbased on an adapted way of calculating the bispectrum.\nIn general, the bispectral method can be used to examine\nphase and frequency relationships at arbitrary time. It is thus\nwell suited for detecting the presence of quadratic couplings\nand frequency modulation, since they both give rise to fre-\nquency components at the sum and difference of the inter-\nacting frequency components.\nTo be able to detect linear couplings using the bispectral\nmethod, as proposed, it is necessary to change the frequency\nrelation. Study of coupled Poincare\u00b4 oscillators demonstrate\nthe presence of a component at frequency 2k2l as a conse-\nquence of nonlinearity. This component was detected nu-\nmerically, and is not necessarily characteristic of all nonlin-\near oscillators. By modifying the bispectral definition to\nBa~k ,l !5E@X~k !X~ l !X*~2k2l !# , ~8!\nthe biphase turns into\nfa~k ,l !5fk1f l2f2k2l2fc , ~9!01620where index a is introduced and will be used in what follows\nto indicate that the values are obtained using the adapted\nmethod. To obtain 0 radians in the case of phase coupling we\nhave to correct the adapted biphase expression ~9! by sub-\ntracting fc52f l2fk . In the presence of a harmonically\nrelated frequency component and phase coupling, the bi-\nphase will then be 0 radians.\nThe adapted bispectrum uBau for the signal x1A exhibits\nseveral peaks, as shown in Fig. 3~a!. It peaks where f 1\n5f2; a triple product ( f 1 , f 2 , f 3) of power at frequencies f 1\n5 f 25 f , and also f 352 f 12 f 25 f , raises a high peak at the\nbifrequency ( f , f ). The self-coupling peak is physically\nmeaningless, and it is therefore cut from the adapted bispec-\ntrum. It can be used for additional checking, since it strongly\nimplies nonlinearity @6#.\nThe peak of primary interest is at bifrequency ~1.1 Hz,\n0.24 Hz!. There is also a high peak positioned at bifrequency\n~0.67 Hz,0.24 Hz! lying on the line where the third frequency\nin the triplet is equal to the frequency of the first oscillator\nand is therefore a consequence of the method. The small\npeaks present in the adapted bispectrum are the result of\nnumerical rounding error and leakage effects due to the DFT\ncalculation.\nThe peak ~1.1 Hz,0.24 Hz! indicates that oscillations at\nthose pairs of frequencies are at least linearly frequency\ncoupled. Frequency coupling alone is sufficient for a peak in\nthe bispectrum to occur. Although the situation can in prin-\nciple arise by coincidence, frequency and phase coupling to-\ngether strongly imply the existence of nonlinearities. To be\nable to distinguish between different possible couplings, we\ncalculate the adapted biphase Fig. 3~c!.\nDuring the first 400 s of test signal x1A , where no cou-\npling is present, the adapted biphase changes continuously\nbetween 0 and 2p radians. For the same time of observation\nit can be seen that the adapted biamplitude is 0, Fig. 3~d!.\nDuring the second and third 400 s of the signal x1A , a con-\nstant adapted biphase can be observed indicating the pres-1-4\nTIME-PHASE BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 016201 ~2003!FIG. 4.

The value of the adapted biamplitude\nis higher in the case of stronger coupling. The coupling con-\nstant h2 can be obtained by normalization, and we are thus\nable to define the relative strengths of different couplings.\nWhen the oscillators are coupled bidirectionally the fre-\nquency content of each of them changes and components 2 f 1\nand 2 f 2 are generated. Both of these characteristic frequen-\ncies can be observed in the time series of each oscillator.\nTwo combinatorial components are also present in their spec-\ntra, 2 f 12 f 2 and f 122 f 2, assuming that f 1. f 2.

Noise\nraises two additional peaks positioned at ~1.1 Hz,0.24 Hz!\nand ~0.86 Hz,0.24 Hz!. The former could be the result of\ninteraction; the latter is due to the method: the sum of the\nfrequencies in this bifrequency pair gives the frequency of\nthe first oscillator.\nClose inspection of the ~0.24 Hz,1.1 Hz! peak by calcula-\ntion of the biphase gives Fig. 5~c!. When coupling is present,\nthe characteristic frequency of the second oscillator appears\nin the power spectrum @Fig. 4~b!#. Two frequencies of high\namplitude result in a small peak even if no harmonics are\npresent at the sum and\/or difference frequencies. The second01620peak is not of interest to us. It can easily be checked whether\na phase coupling exists among the bifrequencies from the\ntime evolution of the biphase.\nIn general, besides estimating bispectral values, one can\nalso observe the time dependences of the phase and ampli-\ntude for each frequency component and their phase relation-\nships. This applies particularly to frequencies that form a\nbifrequency giving a high peak in the bispectrum or adapted\nbispectrum. Synchrograms, Figs. 2~c! and 4~c!, are obtained\nby first calculating the instantaneous phase of each oscillator\nand then their phase difference @1#. The phase difference in\nthis case is between two fixed frequencies.

In order to study an example\nwhere the first f 151.1 Hz and second f 250.24 Hz oscilla-\ntors are quadratically coupled, we change the coupling terms\nin model ~6! to quadratic ones\ngx15h2~x12x2!\n2\n, gy15h2~y12y2!\n2\n. ~11!\nClearly, the test signal x1C presented in Fig. 6~a! for three\ndifferent coupling strengths @no coupling h250 ~1! and\nweak couplings h250.05 ~2!, h250.1 ~3!# has a richer har-\nmonic structure. In addition to the characteristic frequencies,\nit contains components with frequencies 2 f 1 , 2 f 2 , f 11 f 2,\nand f 12 f 2 @Fig. 6~b!#. Equation ~11! also indicates that, as\nwell as having a particular harmonic structure, the compo-\nnents of the signal x1C also have related phases,\n2f1 ,2f2 ,f11f2, and f12f2.\nWe expect several peaks @24# to arise in the bispectrum.\nThe peak of principal interest is at bifrequency ~1.1 Hz,0.24\nHz!. As before, the self-coupling peaks are at ~1.1 Hz,1.1 Hz!\nand ~0.24 Hz,0.24 Hz! are of no interest, so they are cut from\nthe bispectrum. Additional peaks appear at the bifrequencies\n~0.86 Hz,0.24 Hz!, ~0.62 Hz,0.48 Hz!, ~0.86 Hz,0.48 Hz!,\n~1.1 Hz,0.48 Hz!, ~1.1 Hz,0.86 Hz!, and ~1.34 Hz,0.86 Hz!.\nThe triplet of harmonically related frequency components\n( f 1 , f 2 , f 3) would peak in the bispectrum when the power for\nall these frequencies differs from zero. The components 0.48\nHz,0.86 Hz,1.34 Hz, and 2.2 Hz resulting from quadratic\ncouplings form such triplets that peak in the bispectrum:\n~0.86 Hz,0.24 Hz,1.1 Hz!, ~0.86 Hz,0.48 Hz, 1.34 Hz!, and\n~1.34 Hz,0.86 Hz,2.2 Hz!. Besides these, there are also other\npeaks, e.g., that at the bifrequency ~0.62 Hz, 0.48 Hz! arising01620from the triplet ~0.62 Hz,0.48 Hz,1.1 Hz!; the sum-difference\ncombination of such frequencies always give the character-\nistic frequency, or one that results from quadratic coupling.\nThe existence of such peaks has no other meaning than as a\nstrong indicator of second-order nonlinearity. Consequently,\nthe biphase for all peaks due to possible nonlinear mecha-\nnisms in the bispectrum must have the same value, and same\nbehavior, as shown, e.g., in Figs. 7~a! and 7~c!. The biphase\nis constant in the presence of quadratic coupling. From the\nbiamplitude, the coupling constant can be determined by nor-\nmalization.\nIn the power spectrum there is a component at frequency\n2 f 12 f 2, even although linear coupling is absent. It arises\nfrom nonlinearity in the Poincare\u00b4 oscillator. The adapted\nbispectrum for the signal x1C shows a peak at bifrequency\n~1.1 Hz,0.24 Hz!, but the adapted biphase varies continu-\nously: we may therefore exclude the possibility of linear cou-\npling being present.\nD. Quadratic couplings in the presence of noise\nAs in the case of linear coupling ~Sec.

The method is evidently noise robust. The\nresults for nonzero coupling are quite different from those\nwhere coupling is absent, Fig. 8~e!.\nE.

Let us now consider an example where the first\noscillator f 151.1 Hz is frequency modulated by the second\none f 250.24 Hz. For this purpose the equations of the first\noscillator become\nx\u02d9 152x1q12y1~v11hmx2!1j~ t !,\n~12!\ny\u02d9 152y1q11x1~v11hmy2!.\nThe model parameters a1,2 , a1,2 and the noise intensity D\nare chosen to be the same as in the previous examples.\nWe thus obtain a test signal x1E . It is the time evolution\nof the variable x1 of the first oscillator, presented in Fig. 9~a!\nwith the corresponding power spectrum 9~b! for three differ-\nent parametric frequency modulation strengths: no modula-\ntion hm50; and modulation hm50.1,0.2. The bispectrum of\nthe test signal x1E , Fig. 9~c!, exhibits several high peaks.\nThe highest are at bifrequencies ~1.1 Hz,0.86 Hz!, ~0.86 Hz,\n0.24 Hz!, and ~1.1 Hz,0.24 Hz!, in addition to the ~1.1 Hz,\n1.1 Hz! peak. They also appear in the case of quadratic cou-\npling. In general, however, the other peaks that appear for\nquadratic coupling are absent. The reason is that although the\ncomponent of the second oscillator f 2 ~one component of the\ntriplet! is not present in the power spectrum, its value is not\nnot exactly zero.\nObserving the biphase, no epochs of constant biphase can\nbe observed, although for strong frequency modulation the\nbiphase is less variable. In the power spectrum, Fig. 9~b!, no\ncomponent rises above the noise level at frequency f 2, of the\nbifrequency pair, where the bispectrum peaks. This is an in-\ndication that there is parametric coupling between the oscil-\nlators, as there is a high value of biamplitude. The biphase\nchanges runs between 0 and 2p , and is modulated in the\nabsence of noise. There are also no rapid 2p phase slips of\nthe kind that are normal if no modulation is present. In the01620absence of couplings and modulation, but in the presence of\nnoise, there would be no such peaks in the power spectrum\nor bispectrum.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have extended the bispectral method to encompass\ntime dependence and have demonstrated the potential of the\nextended technique to determine the type of coupling among\ninteracting nonlinear oscillators. Time-phase couplings can\nbe observed by calculating the bispectrum and adapted\nbispectrum and by obtaining the time-dependent biphase and\nbiamplitude. The method has the advantage that it allows an\narbitrary number of interacting oscillatory processes to be\nstudied.\nRecently introduced methods for synchronization analysis\namong chaotic and noisy oscillations ~see Ref. @1# and refer-\nences therein! have stimulated applications to a variety of\ndifferent systems. Methods for quantifying the strength and\nidentifying the direction of couplings, based on nonlinear\ndynamic or information theory approaches, have recently\nbeen proposed @2#. Here we have addressed the question of\nthe type of coupling that may result in synchronization, and\nwe have proposed a method for its analysis. It is applicable\nto both univariate data ~a single signal from the coupled\nsystem! or multivariate data ~a separate signal from each\noscillator!.\nMillingen et al. @15# have analyzed multivariate data us-\ning a combined wavelet and bispectral method, and have\ndiscussed its application in the field of chaos analysis. Here\nwe have concentrated on univariate data and illustrated the\npotential of the time-phase bispectral method for the detec-\ntion of higher-order couplings in the presence of noise. The\npossibility of using univariate data is of particular impor-\ntance when dealing with real signals, as in practice we often\ncannot observe and measure the separate subsystems directly,\nbut only their combination, which is intrinsically difficult.\nMost of the methods proposed so far for synchronization\nanalysis and detection of the direction of couplings are based1-8\nTIME-PHASE BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 016201 ~2003!FIG. 8.

Synchroni-\nzation can also be detected in univariate data through an\nanalysis of angles and radii @29# in return time maps @30#.\nThe time-phase bispectral method proposed in this paper\nis not only applicable to the synchronization analysis of\nunivariate data but also, at the same time, allows one to\ndetermine the nature of the couplings among the interacting\nnonlinear oscillators.

Further, where the possible basic frequencies\nare relatively close, it will be hard to detect them separately.\nThis could cause particular problems in the detection of qua-\ndratic phase couplings where frequency pairs are close to-\ngether. Although it is possible in principle to study an arbi-\ntrary number of interacting oscillators, it is advisable in\npractice to study them in pairs: a knowledge of the basic\nfrequency of each is necessary.\nThe time-dependent biphase-biamplitude estimate was es-\ntimated with a short-time Fourier transform ~STFT!, using a\nwindow of constant length. The optimal window length de-\npends, however, on the frequency being studied. The effec-\ntive length of the window used for each frequency can be\nvaried by applying the wavelet transform, or the selective\nFourier transform. For demonstration purposes above, the\nnatural frequencies of the oscillators were chosen to lie016201within a relatively narrow frequency interval. A STFT was\ntherefore sufficient for good time and phase ~frequency! lo-\ncalization. With a broader frequency content, however, the\nwavelet transform or selective Fourier transform will need to\nbe applied.\nHigher-order spectral methods can be used to study arbi-\ntrary interactions among coupled oscillators: of quadratic,\ncubic, or even higher order. In this paper we have concen-\ntrated on the lowest one, using the third-order spectrum or\nbispectrum. For higher orders the volume of the calculations\nrises substantially, and the method becomes numerically in-\ncreasingly demanding. At the same time, graphical presenta-\ntion and interpretation of the results become increasingly dif-\nficult.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge valuable comments and dis-\ncussions with Andriy Bandrivskyy, Justin Fackrell, Mounir-10\nTIME-PHASE BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68, 016201 ~2003!Ghogho, Fluvio Gini, Georgios B.

To achieve statistical stability, the time series is di-\nvided into K segments for averaging @25#. When there is a\nlarge number of segments, the estimate gains statistical sta-\nbility at the expense of power spectral and bispectral resolu-\ntion. For a real signal, with a finite number of points, the\ncompromise between bispectral resolution and statistical sta-\nbility may be expected at K around 30. Estimates are subject\nto statistical error, such as bias and variance. An estimate\nmust be consistent, that is the statistical error must approach\nzero in the mean-square sense as the number of realizations\nbecomes infinite. Here we neglect the effects of finite time\nseries length, we assume that they are sufficiently long. Let\nus consider the bias and the variance of the bispectrum esti-\nmate B\u02c6 (k ,l). The expected value of B\u02c6 (k ,l) will be\nE@B\u02c6 ~k ,l !#5\n1\nK (i51\nK\nE@Xi~k !Xi~ l !Xi*~ l ,k !#\n5E@X~k !X~ l !X*~ l ,k !#5B~k ,l !, ~A1!\nas K becomes infinite, Xi is the DFT of the ith segment.\nThus, B\u02c6 (k ,l) can be taken as an unbiased estimate @29#.

The vari-\nance is proportional to the product of the powers \u0086P(k)\n5E@X(k)X*(k)#\u0087 at the frequencies k, l, and k1l . Conse-\nquently, a larger statistical variability is introduced in esti-\nmating larger values in the bispectrum.

That is, when the oscillations at k, l,\nand k1l are nonlinearly coupled (b2\u20191), the variance ap-\nproaches zero, and when the components are statistically in-\ndependent (b2\u20190), the variance is proportional to the power\nat each spectral component @26#.\nBrillinger and Rosenblatt @3# have investigated the\nasymptotic mean and variance of Fourier-type estimates of\nhigh-order spectra and proved that under certain assumptions\nthe kth order spectral estimate is asymptotically unbiased\nand Gaussianly distributed and that estimates of different or-\nder are asymptotically independent. The variances of the real\nand imaginary parts of the bispectrum are asymptotically\n~i.e., for large K) Gaussian and are equal, var$Re@B\u02c6 (k ,l)#%\n>var$Im@B\u02c6 (k ,l)#%. For a perfect phase-coupled triplet, the\nvariances of the real and imaginary parts are equal to zero. In\nthe case of no coupling, there is an identical contribution to\nthe variances from the real and imaginary parts of the esti-\nmate of the bispectrum.\nThe total variance is a sum of individual (i51, . . . ,K)\ncontributions, because different triplets are mutually statisti-\ncally uncorrelated in the absence of phase coupling. Partial\ncoupling can be expected to result in a combination of per-\nfectly phase-coupled oscillations and oscillations with ran-\ndomly changing phases.@1# A.S. Pikovsky, M.G. Rosenblum, and J.
