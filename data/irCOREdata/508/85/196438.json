INTRODUCTION \n \nDuring AF, atrial electrical activity is described as chao- \ntic and random [1]. Frequency domain analysis can help \nto interpret such activity. DF analysis has been used in \nseveral fields such as acoustic emission [2], speech perc- \neption [3] and cardiac arrhythmias [4]. DF is defined as \nthe frequency of the signal at the point where the frequ- \nency spectrum has the maximum value. \nThe current available treatment of AF consists of me- \ndication, electrical cardioversion and ablation. Typically, \nantiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone, propa- \nfenone and flecainide are used for sinus rhythm control \n[5] but they are not effective to prevent irregular rhyt- \nhms. \nIf medication is not suitable to control the sinus rhy- \nthms, electrical cardioversion is considered [6]. The pro- \ncedure is called defibrillation. It can be performed in 2 \ndifferent ways: at the hospital (electrical cardioversion) \nor using an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device \n(ICD). \nWhen medication and electrical cardioversion control \nfail, ablation is usually the next step to be considered. \nCatheter-based radio frequency ablation therapies offer a \nchance to cure AF. The chances for people survival were \n98% and 95% in year 1 and year 2 respectively [5]. The \nablation performed in early paroxysmal AF has the hig- \nhest chance for success compared to its use for persistent \nand permanent AF [7]. The success rate of ablation at \nDF site is shown by significant prolongation of the atrial \nfibrillation cycle length (AFCL) compared to the site \nwith non-dominant frequency [8,9]. This result supports \nthe use of DF mapping to identify suitable ablation tar-\ngets. \nCatheter ablation of AF is a complex interventional el- \nectrophysiologic procedure. Its risk is higher than that of \nablation for other cardiac arrhythmias [10]. The worldw- \nide survey of AF ablation reported that 6.0% complica-\ntion was recorded (524\/8745) [11]. Univariate analysis \nstated that sex, age, insertion difficulty, length of the ins- \nerted catheter, type of catheter and, term of insertion were \namong contributors for catheter related blood stream in- \nfection [12]. The risks include requiring prolonged hos-\npitalization, long-term disability or death [13]. \nSince the duration of the ablation and overall proce-\n \nA. Ahmad et al \/ J. Biomedical Science and Engineering 3 (2010) 843-847 844 \ndure is one of the contributors to blood stream infection, \ncomputation time is critical for any technique to be used \nduring any surgical procedure. Shortening the analysis \ntime can significantly influence the risk of overall surgi-\ncal procedure. Our aim in this study is to compare the \ncomputation time for four different spectrum analysis \ntechniques and compare the different techniques in their \nability for producing accurate results. \nWith current technology the data collection capability \nfor non-contact mapping systems consists of catheter mo- \nunted multielectrode array allowing the recording up to \n3000 points of virtual electrophysiological at 1000 Hz. \nWith this number of data points, it is important to iden-\ntify an approach that could be used to produce DF with \nminimum computation time. \nThis will in turn help electrophysiologist to identify \nthe dangerous frequencies as target ablation sites and to \napply ablation effectively in an expeditious manner. The \nfrequency between 6-10 Hz is classified as \u2018dangerous\u2019 \nas the atria fires in an irregular and chaotic fashion. \nThe main objective of this study is to reduce the risk \nduring catheter procedure by selecting the technique for \nestimation of DF with the shortest computation. \n2. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS \n2.1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Technique \nThe application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is \nimportant in signal processing computations using speci- \nally in spectral analysis [13]. The discrete Fourier trans-\nform of \uf028 \uf029x nT  is given by \n\uf028 \uf0291\n0\n2N\nn\nkX x nT e\nNT N\nj nk\uf070\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf03d\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e5           (1) \nThe FFT algorithm is the main choice for obtaining \nthe Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) because of its sp- \need. \nWelch technique based on FFT algorithm is used to co- \nmpute the periodogram. This technique uses signal seg-\nmentation and averaging to improve statistical properties \nof the spectral estimates [14]. The equation for comput-\ning the averaged periodogram is: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n1\n1\u02c6 \u02c6 0 2\nM\nw k m k k s\nm\nP f P f f f\nm \uf03d\n\uf03d \uf0a3\uf0e5 \uf0a3     (2) \nwhere  is the periodogram of the mth segment \nof data? \n\uf028 \uf029m\u02c6 kP f\nThe ends of the data sequence are tapered to zero wh- \nen data is windowed. DF was obtained from the Welch\/ \nFFT analysis. There are a few considerations to the use \nof DF analysis especially for the electrograms [4]: \na) The estimation of the power spectrum uses the FFT \nbecause this is an efficient and widely available method. \nb) The maximum frequency is inversely proportional  \nto the sampling interval t\uf044  as \nt\uf0442\n1 . \nThe frequency resolution in the power spectrum is inv- \nersely proportional to the length of the signal \nT\nf 1\uf0b5\uf044  \nwhere T is the length of the signal collected \uf028 \uf029T N t\uf03d \uf044 . \nThis has implications for the interpretation of the DF \nobtained. \n2.2. Blackman-Tukey (BT) Technique \nThis method was proposed by Blackman and Tukey \n(1958) [13]. The estimator is based on the Wiener-Kh- \ninchin theorem, which states that the relationship of the \npower spectrum density is the Fourier Transform of \nthe autocorrelation function of the series [15,16]. \nIf fewer data points are used, the variance of the aut- \nocorrelation estimate increases and the estimate become \nless reliable [13]. The averaging associated with win-\ndowing a series decreases the resolution of the methods, \nfrom the frequency intervals of 1\/N, to a windowed fre-\nquency interval of about 1\/M, where M is the length of \nthe window. As a result, wider windows yield higher sp- \nectral resolution, and vice versa. The drawbacks of Bla- \nckman-Tukey are suppression of weak signal main-lobe \nresponses by strong signal sidelobe and frequency reso-\nlution limited by the available data record duration. \nThis method involves 3 steps [13]: \n1) The autocorrelation sequence of the data is esti-\nmated using the formula; \n\uf028 \uf029 1\n0\n1\u02c6 0,1,2, 1\nN\nxx n n m\nn\nR m x x m N\nN\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf03d \uf02d\uf0e5 \uf04b\uf04b   (3) \nwhere: xn is the n-th value of the data series, N is the \ntotal number of points in the data series m is the auto-\ncorrelation lag ^ signifies estimated value. \n2) Windowing the autocorrelation sequence. \nThe windowing of the autocorrelation sequence is no- \nrmally carried out using a hamming window that has the \nfollowing characteristics: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n20.54 0.46cos , 1 1\n0,\nmw m M m M\nM\nw m otherwise\n\uf070\uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf03d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02d \uf0a3\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf03d\n\uf0a3 \uf02d  \n(4) \n3) Finding the Fourier transform to yield the following \nPSD estimate [15]: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n1\n2\n1\n\u02c6 \u02c6\nM\nj fm\nBT xx\nm M\nP f R m w m e \uf070\n\uf02d \uf02d\n\uf03d\uf02d \uf02d\n\uf03d \uf0e5      (5) \nwhere: w (m) is a window function of length 2(M-1)-1, \nwhich is zero for |m|  M-1 \uf0b3\nThe PSD estimate is determined over the frequency  \nrange 1\n2 2\n1\ns s\nf\nf f\n\uf02d \uf0a3 \uf0a3 where fs is the sampling fre-\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

The relation \nbetween input and output are described by the following \ndifference equation which represents the auto-regressive \nmoving average ARMA (pole-zero) model: \n1 0\np q\nn pk n k qk n k\nk k\nx a x b u\uf02d \uf02d\n\uf03d \uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf02b\uf0e5 \uf0e5         (6) \nwhere: p,q are model orders for the AR and the MA pa- \nrts, respectively a,b are model parameter (apk being the \nkth parameter of the pth-order model) \nThe autoregressive (AR) part of this general equation \nis given by: \n1\np\nn pk n k\nk\nnx a x u\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf02b\uf0e5               (7) \nKnowing p past values of the series we can estimate \nthe next output as: \n1\n\u02c6\np\nn pk\nk\nn kx a x \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d\uf0e5                  (8) \nEquation (8) defines the AR with all-pole model. Wh- \nile, the MA model is given by: \n0\n\u02c6\nq\nn qk\nk\nn kx a u \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d\uf0e5                  (9) \nThe prediction error epn is defined as the difference \nbetween the actual sample value xn and its predicted \nvalue \u02c6nx . \n1\n\u02c6\np\npn n n n pk n k\nk\ne x x x a x \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf03d \uf02b\uf0e5       (10) \nThe power spectrum of an AR process is: \n\uf028 \uf029 2 2\n2\n1\n\u02c6\n1\ne\nAR p j fk\npkk\nP f\na e \uf070\n\uf073\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf0e5\n      (11) \nwhere 2e\uf073  is the variance of epn. \n2.4. Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) \nThe multiple signal classification is the improvement of \nPisarenko harmonic decomposition [17]. This is an ei-\ngen-based subspace decomposition method and is best \nused to estimate the frequencies of complex sinusoids in \nadditive white noise [18]. \nAssume that y(n) is a random process that consists of \np complex exponentials in white noise, \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292\n1\nk k\np\nj f n\nk\nk\ny n A e n n\uf070 \uf066\uf02d \uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf0e5 \uf02b       (12) \nThe autocorrelation matrix of a noisy signal can be \nwritten as: \nyy xx nR R R n\uf03d \uf02b             (13) \nwhere: xx  is the autocorrelation matrix of the signal \n is the autocorrelation matrix of the noise. \nR\nnnR\nEigen-analysis is used to partition the eigenvectors \nand the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix of a \nnoisy signal into 2 subspaces, signal subspace and noise \nsubspace. The eigenvector can be divided by two groups, \nthe p signal eigenvector corresponding to the p largest \neigenvalues and M \u2013 p noise eigenvector corresponding \nto the smallest eigenvalues [19]. \nIdeally, p of these roots will lie in the unit circle on \nthe frequencies of the complex exponentials. The small-\nest eigenvalue determines the noise variance and the \ncorresponding eigenvector is the prediction polynomial \nfor the clean signal [20]. \nIn MUSIC, the effects of spurious peaks are reduced \nby averaging. The power spectrum estimate is defined as \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 2\n1\nN\nH\nxx k\nk p\nP f v e f\n\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf03d \uf0e5          (14) \nwhere N is the dimension of the eigenvectors vk is the \nk-th eigenvector of the correlation matrix p is the dimen-\nsion of the signal subspace. \nSince \uf028 \uf029xxP f  has its zeros at the frequencies of the \nsinusoids, hence the reciprocal of \uf028 \uf029xxP f  has its poles \nat these frequencies [18]. Then, the MUSIC spectrum \ncan be written as \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 21\n1\nMUSIC N H\nkk p\nP f\nv e f\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf03d \uf0e5      (15) \n3. METHOD \nThe spectrum estimation analysis was tested using sinu-\nsoid signals in noise to identify their DF using the 4 dif-\nferent approaches. In FFT analysis, Welch method esti-\nmates the frequency spectrum of the signals. The Fourier \ntransform was calculated separately for each of the seg-\nments. The analysis was performed by taking the aver-\nage of the segments, each with 2048 points, using a \n4096-point FFT and an overlap of 50% with a hamming \nwindow. \nIn Blackman-Tukey method, the autocorrelation was \ndetermined using 4096 points. This autocorrelation func-\ntion was windowed with the same hamming window \nused for the FFT approach (4096-point). \nThe autoregressive spectrum was determined based on \nA. Ahmad et al \/ J. Biomedical Science and Engineering 3 (2010) 843-847 846 \nthe finite linear aggregate of the previous value of the \nprocess and the current value of white noise. The model \norder used was p = 8. \nAs for MUSIC, two complex exponentials with the \nsame window are used to identify the spectrum. \n4. RESULTS \nThe spectrum estimation was determined using several \ntest frequencies: 8.0 Hz, 7.7 Hz, 7.0 Hz, 6.3 Hz, 5.5 Hz \nand 5.0 Hz. Figure 1 shows the graphical results of FFT, \nBlackman-Tukey, Autoregressive and MUSIC in which \ntested using sinusoidal wave of 8 Hz. DF is being con-\nsistently estimated as 8Hz. \nTable 1 shows the DF value comparison for all tech-\nniques against the base Frequency. \nThe results show consistent value of DF produced by \nall techniques. \nTable 2 shows that, the percentage error is of the \nsame order of magnitude for these 4 techniques. \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n0.5\n1\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nP\nS\nD\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n5\n10\nx 10\n7 Blackman-Tukey (BT)\nP\nS\nD\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n1\n2\nx 108 Autoregressive (AR)\nP\nS\nD\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0\n1\n2\nx 10\n-3 Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)\nFrequency\nP\nS\nD\n \nFigure 1.

As mentioned before \n3000 points is the state-of-art for mapping atrial activa-\ntion. \nTable 3 shows a significant difference in processing \ntime between the 4 techniques tested. In summary, FFT \ntakes 22.8 seconds to process 3000 signals compared to \n340.9 s for BT, 206.4 s for AR and 10851.8 s for MU-\nSIC. As discussed before, all techniques produce the \nsame estimation for DF. Therefore, the time taken to \nproduce the estimation is the main factor for the choice \nof which technique should be used. \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nThe study shows significant difference in computation \ntime between the techniques while the estimated value \nfor DF was the same for all four techniques. The choice \nof a particular technique contributes to the overall surgi-\ncal procedure time. As discussed before the duration of \ncatheter deployment is a factor that can contribute to \nblood stream infection. Therefore, the selection of the \nfastest technique will reduce the risk of the procedure. \nAs shown by the result of this study, FFT is the best \ntechnique as it produces accurate estimates of DF in a \nspeed compatible for quasi real-time analysis. \n6.
