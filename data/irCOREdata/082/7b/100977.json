In re-\ncent years, Andreev reflection1 \u0001AR\u0002 spectroscopy has been\nwidely used to measure the transport spin polarization \u0001P\u0002 in\nmagnetic metals2,3 and magnetic semiconductors.4,5 It might\nalso be a viable method to detect spin accumulation and\ndiffusion in nonmagnetic metals and semiconductors by\nmaking high resolution nanojunction arrays. Indeed, many\ngroups have embraced modern fabrication methods to\nachieve Andreev nanojunctions.6,7 However, despite the large\nbody of work on superconductor\/semiconductor\/\nsuperconductor \u0001S\/Sm\/S\u0002 structures,8,9 fabricating single\nS\/Sm structures with desirable interface properties remains a\nconsiderable challenge. Attempts to engineer a transparent\nS\/Sm interface with plasma cleaning have resulted in en-\nhanced effective broadening and suppression of the super-\nconductor energy gap.10 In addition, high Fermi velocity\nmismatch contributes11 to the effective interface scattering\nbarrier strength Z and, as a result, doping of the Sm may be\nrequired to reduce the Schottky barrier.12\nWe are interested in developing high resolution Andreev\nprobes13 to study spin accumulation in narrow gap semicon-\nductors such as InAs and InSb, of interest for spintronics due\nto their optical properties, high mobility, and high spin-orbit\ncoupling. In the present work, we establish by simulation\nthat there is a maximum workable Z value and we demon-\nstrate that the most feasible route to achieve this is by an\n\u201cetch-back\u201d processing strategy. Most remarkably, we also\nfind that the interface properties fall into four clearly defin-\nable regimes of behavior and we discuss the likely source of\nthese differences.\nWe compare three routes to process planar structures on\n1 \u0001m thick InAs, grown by molecular beam epitaxy.14 In\nroute 1, a SiOx mask layer was deposited onto InAs in which\napertures were opened using focused ion beam milling \u0001FIB\u0002\nto define the contact areas. In route 2, apertures were opened\nin a SiOx mask layer on InAs using a photolithographic lift-\noff process. Route 3 involves an etch-back approach where a\nPb film \u0001\u0005100 nm thick\u0002 was deposited onto InAs before\npatterning, with the InAs subjected to either \u0001i\u0002 a degrease in\nacetone and isopropanol or \u0001ii\u0002 a degrease followed by an\n18.5% HCl etch and 2.1% \u0001NH4\u00022S for surface passivation\nbefore Pb deposition. Photolithography and Ar+ ion milling\nwere used to define a mesa structure before backfilling with\nSiOx. In all routes, superconducting Pb tracks, crossing the\njunction areas, were defined using photolithography and lift-\noff. Routes 1 and 2 are described in more detail elsewhere.15\nThe differential conductance of all the junctions was mea-\nsured four terminally.\nThe Andreev spectra are analyzed by finding the best\nleast-squares fit to the generalized16 Blonder-Tinkham-\nKlapwijk \u0001BTK\u0002 theory.17 There are four fitting parameters:\nthe superconductor energy gap \u0002, the spin-polarization P, a\ngeneric smearing parameter \u0003, and the dimensionless effec-\ntive barrier parameter Z, which has been shown to be a rea-\nsonable approximation of the complex underlying physics of\nthe interface.18 We perform a three parameter fit for a range\nof fixed P values to obtain the quality of fit function \u00042\u0001P\u0002\nand its minimum can be used to predict the correct value of\nP, as described in more detail in Ref. 19. The smearing pa-\nrameter \u0003 has also been discussed previously19 where it was\nshown that the extracted \u0003 includes the combined effects of\nthermal and any nonthermal smearing mechanisms without\nmaking any assumptions about their origin. For pure thermal\nbroadening, it is defined as \u0003\u0006kBT.\nIn order to determine the maximum tolerated Z value for\naccurate detection of P, we simulate spectra for a range of Z\nvalues and show the results of the \u00042\u0001P\u0002 dependence in Fig.\n1. The fitting routine cannot find the correct minimum for\nZ\u00050.8 although the correct value of P represents a threshold\nabove which the fit rapidly breaks down. Consequently, the\nfabrication route must be capable of producing an interface\nwith Z\u00060.8. The Fermi velocity mismatch between Pb and\nthe InAs surface accumulation layer with a carrier density of\n\u00051\u00071018 cm\u22123 results in an effective minimum Z\u00050.4.\nNow, let us turn to the experimental exploration of fea-\nsibility. Preparation routes 1 and 2 produce a reaction inter-\nfacial layer, recognizable by a broad V-shaped conductance\nbackground GN\u0001V\u0002, which can be characterized by raisinga\u0002Electronic mail: l.cohen@imperial.ac.uk.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 012501 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u00021\u0001\/012501\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 012501-1\nDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130.

In the following,\nabove-Tc normalization will be denoted by NT\bTc and above-\nBc normalization with NB\bBc. The main graph of Fig. 2\nshows a typical conductance spectrum from route 1. The\nbelow-Tc and-Bc2 spectrum shows a dip in conductance\naround zero bias with barely visible wing peaks, indicative\nof highly suppressed AR. The presence of a zero bias dip in\nthe above-Bc2 spectrum confirms that its origin is interfacial\nand not AR related. Both NT\bTc and NB\bBc yield spectra\nwhich can be fitted by BTK theory. The \u0002 and \u0003 values\nobtained are similar for both normalization methods but Z is\nstrikingly different. For NT\bTc, Z=3.8 whereas for NB\bBc,\nZ=1.9. In the presence of smearing, Z and P have very simi-\nlar effects on the shape of the AR spectrum so such a dis-\ncrepancy in Z will have serious implications for the detection\nof P.19 Consequently, we have to explore other routes that do\nnot produce such interfacial layers.\nSamples from route 2 share features similar to those of\nroute 1 samples but are almost completely unaffected by the\napplication of B\bBc2. The temperature dependence of the\nzero bias conductance up to 250 K is well described by tun-\nneling models such as the Stratton model,20 indicating that\nroute 2 produces tunnel-barrierlike interface properties which\ndominate over AR. Route 2 does not damage the InAs sur-\nface but relies on lift-off of photoresist from the interface,\nwhich leaves a chemical residue which strongly affects inter-\nface properties.\nRoute 3 is an etch-back approach where Pb is deposited\nonto the InAs surface before any processing takes place. The\nresults from route 3\u0001i\u0002 samples without the chemical preetch\nvary significantly due to the roughness, inhomogeneity, and\nthe native In oxide of the InAs surface.21 The left inset of\nFig. 2 shows an example of junctions that show high Z,\nexceptionally low \u0003, and a constant GN\u0001V\u0002. This suggests a\npinhole-free uniform thin tunnel barrier, and about 25% of\njunctions show this property. A significant fraction of junc-\ntions have a value of Z as low as 0.6 \u000135% have Z\u00061\u0002, very\nlow \u0003, and a constant GN\u0001V\u0002, as shown in the right inset of\nFig. 2. The low-Z junctions also exhibit sharp dip features\ncommonly seen in S\/N junctions. Their origin has been\nwidely discussed22\u201324 but in our case, they are associated\nwith the superconducting critical current being exceeded in\nthe junction area. Route 3\u0001ii\u0002 produces the lowest resistance\ninterfaces, so low in fact that in all but two of the junctions,\nthe Pb \/Pb interface \u0001which results from our current process-\ning strategy\u0002 dominates the conductance spectrum producing\na Josephson junction in series.\nFigure 3 shows how the parameters extracted from our\nFIG. 1.

Route 1 \u0001using NB\bBc\u0002 junctions have depressed \u0002 and\nhigh nonthermal broadening. A heavily disordered layer or a\nvery rough interface extending over a depth t greater than the\nbulk superconducting coherence length \t would produce in-\nelastic scattering in the superconductor reducing quasiparti-\ncle lifetime,6,25,26 and this is the most likely candidate for\nthese observations. Although an induced proximity layer6,10\nwould produce similar observations, this should result from a\nvery clean interface which is unlikely for route 1 junctions.\nThe route 3\u0001i\u0002 junctions fall mostly into three other well\ndefined categories, most clearly identified in the inset to Fig.\n3. These three categories each have high \u0002 values but vary in\nterms of their Z and smearing parameters. Junctions that\noriginate from a rough, disordered layer \u0001t\u0006\t\u0002 have high\nsmearing but low Z. Junctions that have a thin homogenous\nbarrier are characterized by high Z but low smearing while\nthe sought after junctions which have a homogenous low\nscattering barrier show low Z and low smearing. Many of\nthese junctions \u0003including the measurable route 3\u0001ii\u0002 junc-\ntions\u0004 show purely thermal broadening. One of the data sets\nactually lies below the thermal smearing limit but we can\nattribute this to the effect of the anomalous conductance dips\nshown in the inset of Fig. 2 inset. By simulating the effect of\nexceeding the critical current in the contact region, we find\nthat when the dip voltages are close to the energy gap, they\nartificially suppress the smearing parameter by up to 30%\nand this accounts for the observed trend. Apparent broaden-\ning less than the thermal limit is, therefore, an artifact of the\nfitting process if the effects of the conductance dips are ig-\nnored. No other data shown in Fig. 3 are affected by this\nartifact.\nDeviation from the thermal smearing line can be attrib-\nuted to nonthermal smearing effects, which as we discussed\nearlier can have a variety of origins. We differentiate be-\ntween behavior where the smearing retains a thermal-like\nlinear temperature dependence but is offset from the purely\nthermal limit and the more extreme higher residual smearing,\nwhich is associated with a much weaker temperature depen-\ndence gradient. The latter case either implies that the domi-\nnant nonthermal mechanism has an inherently different tem-\nperature dependence or that the nonthermal and thermal\nsmearing contributions do not follow a simple sum rule.\nThere is no reason to suppose that they should. However,\ninelastic scattering is more likely to mimic thermal effects\nbecause it spreads the quasiparticle distribution in a similar\nway and it is plausible that the simple sum rule might apply\nin this case. This also suggests that the nonthermal smearing\nin the extreme limit originates from sample inhomogeneity\nrather than inelastic scattering, but these arguments can only\nbe speculative at this stage.\nTo summarize, we have established that the interface pa-\nrameter Z must be below 0.8 for reliable detection of spin\npolarization using our four parameter model. Exposing the\njunction to FIB milling or photoresist degrades junction\nproperties severely whereas etch-back processing is capable\nof producing junctions with a very low interface barrier and\nnegligible nonthermal smearing. We have identified four\nclear regimes of behavior in our junctions, partly as a result\nof the different types of processing. Improving reproducibil-\nity of junction properties using etch-back methodology with\nappropriate surface preparation methods and moving to\nnanojunction arrays is the next task.\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council Grants GR\/T03802 and\nEPC511972 and the National Physical Laboratory under the\nDTI Quantum Metrology Programme.\n1A.
