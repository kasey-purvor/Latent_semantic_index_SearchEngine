Obesity is one of the main determinants of\navoidable burden of disease [1]. In lack of affordable, non-\ninvasive, long-term effective obesity treatment, and\nbecause the ill-health effects of obesity are not fully\nreversible, a stronger focus on obesity prevention has\nbeen advocated [2]. Because overweight and obesity in\nadulthood are predicted by childhood and adolescent\noverweight, obesity prevention should start early in life.\nOne important target group is school-aged children, i.e.\nthe age-group right before and at the start of adolescence.\n* Correspondence: j.brug@vumc.nl\n1 Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics and the EMGO Institute for \nHealth and Care Research, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the \nNetherlands\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nBrug et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:276\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/276\nPage 2 of 10\nThis is a risk age for unnecessary weight gain as well as an\nage in which children develop more behavioral autonomy\nand may make negative health behavior changes [3]. The\nneed for obesity prevention in schoolchildren is further\nindicated by the prediction that in 2010 about 38% of\nschool-aged children in the WHO European Region will\nbe overweight, and more than one quarter will be obese.\nThese figures are similar or even worse in other affluent\nregions, such as North America and Australasia [4]. This\nage group is certainly not the only age group of relevance\nfor promoting a healthy energy balance. In fact energy\nbalance should be promoted throughout the life course,\nand should start early in life and continue through adoles-\ncence, and adulthood. But such efforts should be tailored\nand targeted to the age group and their specific determi-\nnants. ENERGY focuses therefore on one important age\ngroup.\nThe school environment is regarded as a good setting\nfor health promotion interventions among school-age\nchildren [5]. Schools offer an environment where almost\nall children can be reached repeatedly and continuously,\nand where health education can be combined with health\npromoting structural environmental changes. For obesity\nprevention, schools have additional relevance as a health\npromotion setting, because most children eat a signifi-\ncant amount of food at school and schools offer physical\neducation as well as other physical activity opportunities\n[6].\nAlthough genetic factors may influence the susceptibil-\nity of individuals to weight gain [7], there is consensus\nthat changes in lifestyle behavior are driving the obesity\nepidemic [8] rather than changes in biologic or genetic\nfactors. A long-term positive energy balance, i.e. energy\ninput through food intake exceeds energy expenditure for\nbody functions and physical activity, leads to storage of\nexcess energy as fat, to weight gain, and eventually to obe-\nsity. Prevention of unnecessary weight gain should thus\ntarget modifiable behaviors that influence energy intake\nand expenditure. Obesity prevention among schoolchil-\ndren should therefore target dietary, physical activity and\nsedentary behaviors [2].\nFindings of an increasing number of studies suggest\nthat school-based interventions that target both sides of\nthe energy balance are promising [9]. These studies also\nshow, however, that although positive behavior changes\nare often induced, most of the interventions evaluated to\ndate do not yet show success in reducing the prevalence\nof overweight, especially on the longer term [10]. System-\natic reviews suggest that this is due to the fact that such\nintervention schemes were not always guided by a careful\nenough systematic theory and evidence-based develop-\nment process; failed to combine both sides of the energy\nbalance; did not combine educational with environmental\nchange strategies; were not aiming or able to significantly\ninvolve the family and home environment; and did not\nconduct careful pretesting before larger scale implemen-\ntation [10,11].\nThe ENERGY-project is aiming to learn from and\nupdate these reviews and apply a thorough epidemiologi-\ncal analysis prior to develop and test a school-based and\nfamily-involved intervention scheme. This intervention\nscheme is aimed at promoting dietary and physical activ-\nity behaviors that contribute to a healthy energy balance\namong school-aged children on the brink of adolescence.\nThe European Commission's Directorate General for\nResearch funded the ENERGY-project, within its 7th\nframework program (start date February 1st 2009).\nENERGY stands for EuropeaN Energy balance Research\nto prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth. This\npaper describes the objectives, conceptual framework,\nmethodologies and intended deliverables of the different\nparts of the ENERGY-project and its so-called work pack-\nages. We will first describe the specific objectives of\nENERGY, followed by the planning model and conceptual\nframework, and the organization of the project. Finally,\nthe work and research to be conducted and methods\napplied in the different planning and development steps\nare described.\nObjectives of the ENERGY-project\nThe overall aim of the ENERGY-project is the develop-\nment of a theory- and evidence-based multi-component\nintervention scheme for prevention of unnecessary\nweight gain among school-aged children, ready to be\nimplemented and tested for effectiveness across Europe.\nWe aim to develop an intervention scheme that is both\nschool-based and family-involved and promotes the\nadoption or continuation of specific health behaviors that\ncontribute to a healthy energy balance. The primary tar-\nget group of the ENERGY-project is children aged 10-12,\ni.e. youth in the transition between childhood and adoles-\ncence. Secondary intermediate target groups are their\nparents and school staff.\nThe specific objectives of the ENERGY-project are:\n1. to perform a thorough, multidisciplinary analysis of\nthe most important behaviors contributing to the\nenergy balance of children, and their most important\nmodifiable determinants, including personal as well\nas social-cultural, physical, and financial-economic\nenvironmental factors, with a specific focus on the\nfamily and school settings;\n2. to identify successful intervention schemes and\nstrategies as well as the factors mediating and moder-\nating these successful schemes in different sub-popu-\nlations based on age, gender and socio-economic\nstatus, including the exploration of financial interven-\ntion strategies that can be implemented in schools;\nBrug et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:276\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/276\nPage 3 of 10\n3. to design a multi-component school-based and\nfamily-involved intervention using obtained insights\nfrom the above mentioned analyses;\n4. to test the multi-component intervention imple-\nmented for formative, process and intermediary out-\ncome evaluation;\n5. to prepare a large scale implementation and moni-\ntoring plan for dissemination of the intervention\nscheme.\nTo reach these objectives, we will work according to an\nestablished planning model. The tasks derived from that\nmodel were operationalized in eleven work packages.\nThe planning model\nIn order to promote, induce and sustain meaningful\nchanges in health behaviors, a planned stepwise approach\nhas been advocated [12] (Figure 1).\nThe ENERGY-project follows the stepwise approach of\nthe model of Planned Promotion of Population Health.\nENERGY specifically focuses on steps 2, 3 and 4, i.e. the\nanalyses of important and modifiable risk behaviors; of\ndeterminants of exposure to these risk behaviors; and on\nIntervention Mapping (IM). IM is the protocol through\nwhich the intervention is developed tailored to the identi-\nfied risk behaviors and behavioral determinants, and pre-\npared for implementation by means of formative\nevaluation and pilot testing in five countries [13].\nStep 2: Analysis of important risk behaviors\nAs outlined in the Background paragraph, unnecessary\nweight gain and eventually obesity is caused by a positive\nenergy balance in which energy intake exceeds energy\nexpenditure. Excessive energy intake through dietary\nbehaviors relative to energy expenditure for maintaining\nbodily functions and engaging in physical activities are\nthe risk factors at hand. Prevention of unnecessary weight\ngain should therefore aim at reducing energy intake by\nchanges in dietary behaviors and increasing energy\nexpenditure by changes in physical activity and sedentary\nbehaviors. Different specific dietary, physical activity and\nsedentary behaviors may contribute to energy balance,\nand these behaviors have therefore been referred to as\n'energy balance-related behaviors' (EBRB) [14]. It has\nbeen established that a combination of changes at both\nsides of the energy balance is the most promising strategy\nfor successful obesity prevention [15].\nRecent overviews have suggested a range of more spe-\ncific EBRB that may contribute substantially to a higher\nrisk for excessive weight gain. At the intake side of the\nenergy balance, high intakes of energy-dense and\/or\nmicronutrient-poor foods, intakes of specific foods such\nas sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and large portion sizes\nmay increase risk. Low energy expenditure because of a\nsedentary lifestyle has also been identified as associated\nwith higher risk; TV viewing and computer time have\nbeen identified as specific sedentary risk behaviors.\nAlthough the evidence is not always consistent, especially\nwhere computer time is concerned [16], we choose to\ninclude both screen time behaviors as potential risk\nbehaviors to be able to further contribute to the possible\nrelevance and differences between both screen-time\nbehaviors. Behaviors that may contribute to a lower risk\nof unnecessary weight gain are high dietary fiber intake\nand different physical activities, including sports partici-\npation, transport-related physical activity, and active play\n[2]. However, the evidence is not very strong, not always\nconsistent [17] and the relevance of specific EBRB may\ndiffer between different age groups as well as according to\ngender, socioeconomic position and\/or ethnicity.\nThere is thus need for a systematic review of the evi-\ndence for EBRB among school-aged children as well as\nfurther studies to examine the specific risk behaviors\nrelated to overweight and obesity.\nStep 3: Identification of determinants of exposure to the \nrisk behaviors\nIn order to develop interventions to promote obesity pre-\nvention behaviors, insight into behavioral determinants is\nnecessary. Each of the aforementioned EBRB may have\ndifferent determinants; children's 'reasons' for drinking\nsoft drinks may be different from their reasons for spend-\ning too much time watching television. Health behavior\nchanges can be induced and sustained by targeting\nbehavior-specific important and modifiable behavioral\ndeterminants [12].\nBehavioral determinant studies have mostly been\ninformed by psychological theories of human behavior.\nThis has led to a strong focus on personal cognitive deter-\nminants such as attitudes, perceived control and motiva-\ntion [18]. Health education has therefore been the\nprimary tool to encourage the general public to adopt\nFigure 1 A basic model of Planned Promotion of Population \nHealth.\nBrug et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:276\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/276\nPage 4 of 10\nhealth-promoting lifestyles. Health education strongly\nfocuses on conscious behavior change and on improving\nindividuals' knowledge, attitudes, motivations and other\ncognitions that may increase the likelihood of adopting\nhealthy behaviors. However, people's abilities and oppor-\ntunities to make healthful behavior changes may be\ndependent on the environments in which they live [18]. It\nhas been argued that obesity should be regarded as a nor-\nmal response to an abnormal environment [19]. Effective\npromotion of EBRB therefore most probably requires\nchanges in the environment to make the healthy choice\nthe easy or even default choice.\nFour 'types' of environments are often distinguished:\nphysical, economic, political, and socio-cultural [19]. The\nphysical environment refers to the availability and acces-\nsibility of opportunities for EBRB, such as availability of\nfruit and vegetables, soft drink vending machines, and\nsports facilities in the school and home environment. The\neconomic environment refers to the costs related to\nhealthy and unhealthy behaviors, such as the costs of soft\ndrinks or fruit and vegetables, entrance fees to exercise\nfacilities, et cetera. The political environment refers to\nthe rules and regulations that may influence eating and\nphysical activity and sedentary behavior. Bans on vending\nmachines in schools or family rules on how many hours\nchildren can watch television are examples. The socio-\ncultural environment refers to the subjective and descrip-\ntive norms and other social influences such as parental\nsupport, demand or facilitation for adoption of health\nbehavior, or social peer pressure to engage in unhealthy\nhabits.\nRecent studies show that it is not the personal cognitive\nfactors or the environmental that is important, but rather\nthe interplay between the two [14]. The environment we\nlive in may influence our motivation, attitudes, perceived\nnorms or control regarding EBRB. For example, an envi-\nronment that offers plenty of opportunities for healthy\nfood choices may improve motivation to eat a healthy\ndiet, and may improve perceived abilities to eat healthily.\nKremers et al. [14] therefore argued that environmental\nfactors may have a direct impact on EBRB, but these envi-\nronmental influences are also likely to be mediated by\nindividual-level factors. Kremers et al. further suggest\nthat the causal pathway between environments or per-\nsonal cognitions and EBRB may be moderated by such\nfactors as personality, habit strengths and level of aware-\nness of personal health behaviors. Based on these insights\nand preliminary evidence, Kremers et al proposed the\nEnvironmental Research framework for weight Gain pre-\nvention (EnRG-framework) which integrates potential\npersonal cognitive determinants of EBRB with environ-\nmental factors and describes the hypothetical mediating\nand moderating pathways between cognitions and envi-\nronments in influencing EBRB [14]. This EnRG-frame-\nwork was informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior,\ni.e. a key social-psychological theory of health behavior,\nand the Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obe-\nsity (ANGELO), a model that details potential environ-\nmental determinants of EBRB [19].\nRecent reviews show that studies that explore mediat-\ning and moderating pathways between individual-level\nand environmental determinants are largely lacking, and\nsuch studies are especially needed to improve the evi-\ndence-base for EnRG. In the ENERGY-project we have\nadopted the EnRG framework with a specific focus on\nhome and school environmental factors (Figure 2).\nWithin ENERGY this adapted EnRG framework will\ninform systematic reviews, secondary data analyses, orig-\ninal cross-European school-based survey research, and\nintervention development, formative and process evalua-\ntion research.\nStep 4: Intervention Mapping\nThe IM protocol introduced by Bartholomew and col-\nleagues [13] suggests specific steps that guide problem-\ndriven intervention development, supported by the appli-\ncation and integration of health behavior-change theo-\nries. IM proposes a systematic way to proceed from\nknowledge about behavioral determinants to specific\nchange goals, and subsequently to intervention methods\nand strategies based on the production of intervention\nmatrices. Such matrices finally develop into an 'interven-\ntion map' that makes the translation of objectives to\nchange strategies to actual intervention activities explicit.\nThe ENERGY-project will use IM to translate the\nacquired insights in EBRB and their personal, family envi-\nronmental and school environmental determinants into a\nschool-based, family-involved intervention scheme that\ncombines health education with environmental change\nstrategies.\nWork plan and methods applied\nIn the ENERGY-project - in line with how European\nCommission-funded projects are organized - the work to\ngo through the different planning steps is conducted in\neleven work packages (WPs) (see Figure 3).\nWithin all WPs the same state-of-the-art methodology\nwill be used: all WPs have a comparable structure accord-\ning to which the timely finalization of all deliverables will\nbe accomplished.

This WP is responsible for the overall running\nand implementation of the project, will carry out the\nadministrative tasks, and is responsible for the financial\nand organizational management of the project. This WP\nis also responsible for setting up the structure for com-\nmunication through regular meetings and a website.\nWP 2 identifies the most important EBRB among\nschool children aged 10-12 years to contribute to step 2 of\nthe planning model depicted in Figure 1 by reviewing the\nliterature and conducting secondary data analyses of\nexisting datasets.\nWP 3 reviews the literature and conducts secondary\ndata analyses to identify the most important personal,\nfamily environmental and school environmental corre-\nFigure 3 Division of work and timeline of the ENERGY-project.\nBrug et al.

Because most of the evidence on potential deter-\nminants of EBRB to date is based on cross-sectional data,\nWP2 and 3 will primarily focus on reviewing and re-ana-\nlyzing longitudinal studies.\nWPs 4-6 will identify successful intervention schemes,\nmediating pathways of intervention strategies, and\nimportant factors that moderate the effect of intervention\nstrategies. These explorations are primarily based on sec-\nondary analyses of existing successful schemes promoting\nEBRB among schoolchildren and adolescents. WP 4 spe-\ncifically addresses parental involvement in school-based\nschemes, by exploring what factors may promote parental\ninvolvement and what the impact of parental involvement\non EBRB change in their children is. Earlier studies have\nindicated that parental factors and involvement is of key\nimportance for school-aged children's EBRB and for\neffectiveness of primarily school-based interventions\n[20], but determinants of parental involvement in inter-\nventions have hardly been studied before. Therefore, this\nWP includes using qualitative methods, which are espe-\ncially useful for exploring new research issues, as well as\nquantitative analyses of existing data. WP 5 explores what\nsuccessful strategies or successful factors of ongoing\nintervention schemes consist of by means of a literature\nreview and secondary data analyses. The review and sec-\nondary analyses will especially focus on mediation and\nmoderation analyses to gain insight in the underlying\nprocesses of the intervention, in what determinants need\nto be addressed in the new intervention, and to explore\nwhat strategies work best according to, for example, gen-\nder, socioeconomic position or ethnicity. WP 6 explores\neconomic strategies\/incentives and whether these strate-\ngies can be effective and useful in school-based studies.\nApart from a literature review, WP 6 makes an inventory\nof ongoing initiatives regarding economic incentives and\nfurther explores what are the possibilities to implement\nsuch strategies in the school setting by means of a survey\namong school staff and\/or school board members. Eco-\nnomic strategies or incentives have hardly been used nor\nstudied in school-based intervention schemes to date. In\naddition, WP 6 updates recent insights in the importance\nof marketing to children as a driving force behind the\nobesity epidemic especially related to family and school\nenvironments.\nWP 7 comprises a cross-European survey on personal,\nfamily environmental and school environmental corre-\nlates of the different EBRB identified in WP 2. Europe has\na relatively wide variety in social and physical environ-\nmental contexts, dietary practices, physical activity levels\nas well as rates of overweight and obesity, and the cross-\nEuropean survey of WP 7 therefore offers the right\nframework for further exploration of potential determi-\nnants of EBRB and geographical differences in such\ndeterminants. The survey is conducted in seven countries\n(i.e. Belgium, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Nor-\nway, Slovenia, Spain), located in different regions of\nEurope. After the ENERGY-project was approved, an\neighth country - Switzerland - has joined the cross sec-\ntional survey WP of ENERGY with its own funding. This\nsurvey accumulates data on prevalence of overweight -\nbased on objective measures of height, weight and waist-\ncircumference -, on the most important EBRB identified\nin WP2, and on the most important correlates of these\nEBRB identified in WP 3, as outlined and detailed in Fig-\nure 2. This survey results in up-to-date data on EBRB and\ntheir personal and environmental correlates in different\nparts of Europe - including countries for which such data\nis as yet scarce or unavailable. It will provide intervention\nentry points for modification of specific EBRB and their\ndeterminants for WP 8.\nWP 8 will carefully design the intervention using the\nIM protocol by using, integrating and translating infor-\nmation from WPs 2 -7 into specific change objectives,\nselection of effective strategies and development of inter-\nvention materials and protocols.\nWP 9 is devoted to the pilot implementation and pre-\nliminary evaluation of the newly developed intervention\nin five different countries, again located in different\nregions of Europe: Norway, Germany, Belgium, Greece,\nand Hungary. The intervention will be implemented at\nfive schools in each country and five other schools will\nserve as controls. The evaluation study will focus espe-\ncially on process variables and intermediary outcomes.\nWP 10 will use information from WP 9 to prepare the\nfinal intervention package, and an implementation, adop-\ntion, dissemination, and impact monitoring plan. WP 10\nis also responsible for the further exploitation of the\nENERGY-intervention scheme.\nFinally, WP 11 files and administrates all data collected\nin the different WPs and oversees and guards quality-\ncontrolled data management and storage.\nDifferent qualitative and quantitative methods are used\nin the WPs in ENERGY, including systematic reviews,\nfocus group interviews, secondary analyses of existing\ndata sets, as well as original survey and evaluation\nresearch.\nReviews and secondary data analyses\nThe systematic reviews within WPs 2-6 are conducted\naccording to a standard protocol. Basically, after a search\nstrategy is developed and run, relevant papers are identi-\nfied by subsequent selections of article titles, abstracts,\nand full papers, by two independent reviewers. Relevant\ndata from the included studies is extracted and their\nmethodological quality is scored, again independently by\ntwo reviewers. If possible and appropriate, the data of the\nBrug et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:276\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/276\nPage 8 of 10\nretrieved studies are combined to conduct a formal meta-\nanalysis.\nWithin WPs 2-5 analyses of existing datasets are con-\nducted. Relevant datasets owned or managed by the part-\nners in ENERGY will be used as well as additional\npotentially relevant datasets identified through the litera-\nture reviews. The secondary data analyses focus on medi-\nation and moderation analyses of longitudinal data.\nAlthough a number of school-based EBRB interven-\ntions have shown some effects, only very few evaluation\nstudies have looked into how these effects came about,\ni.e. what the mediators of intervention effects were.\nWithin the ENERGY-project the secondary data analyses\nwill exactly do that: assess the mediators of intervention\nsuccess or failure in order to gain insight in the underly-\ning reasons why interventions may be effective or not. For\nthese mediation analyses we will apply the procedure sug-\ngested by MacKinnon [21]. Furthermore, we will test\nmoderators of intervention effects by including possible\nmoderator X intervention interaction terms in the analy-\nses to explore if interventions have differential effects\naccording to, for example, gender, socio-economic posi-\ntion or ethnicity.\nThe study has been approved by the Medical Ethics\nCommittee of Durham University.\nOriginal research\nTo explore what reasons parents have to be involved or\nnot in their children's school-based health promotion\ninterventions, a minimum of four focus group interviews\nwill be conducted in each of four countries (Belgium,\nNorway, Spain, Hungary). Separate focus groups will be\norganized for one random group of parents and three\nseparate groups with parents who (1) often participate in\nparent activities of school-based interventions; (2) par-\nents with low socio-economic positions; and (3) parents\nwith a low interest in EBRB. The focus groups will be\nconducted according to a standard protocol in all four\ncountries. The interviews will be sound-recorded, and\ntranscribed and submitted to content analyses.\nThe cross-European survey in WP7 will take place in\nschools in seven countries in the spring of 2010. We aim\nto collect data among approximately 7000 children to fur-\nther study EBRB and their potential determinants accord-\ning to region, ethnicity, gender and socio-economic\nstatus. The 1000 children per country will be recruited in\na school-based manner. First three provinces in each\ncountry will be randomly selected. Within each province\nthree municipalities with > 20,000 inhabitants will then\nbe randomly selected. Lists of schools in these municipal-\nities are obtained and schools will be randomly selected\nto be invited to participate. All children in the right\nschool-classes for the study will be included in each\nschool. WP 7 will administer survey questionnaires\namong schoolchildren, among their parents and school\nstaff, and conduct audits of the school environment, and\nanthropometric measurements of the participating chil-\ndren. Children's height, weight and waist circumferences\nwill be measured by trained staff, and accelerometers will\nbe used to objectively assess physical activity in a sub-\nsample of about 600 children in three of the participating\ncountries (Figure 2). All measurements will be performed\naccording to written protocols and thus standardized\nbetween countries and schools. The research assistants\nresponsible for the fieldwork receive a joint training.\nThe survey instruments used within WP7 will be devel-\noped based on the input of WPs 2-6, applying previously\nvalidated instruments where possible and appropriate.\nThe survey questionnaires will be pilot-tested, evaluated\nfor test-re-test reliability and internal consistency, and\nthe pre-tested version will be translated to the languages\nof the other participating countries, and then back-trans-\nlated for quality control.\nThe school-environment audit instrument will be\nadopted from the ENDORSE study [2].\nRecruitment of schools, children and parents is con-\nducted according to a standardized stepwise approach\nensuring comparable samples in all countries, aiming for\ninclusion of lower and higher socio-economic position\ngroups.\nAll data collected, i.e. completed surveys and audit\ninstruments, reports on measured height, weight and\nwaist circumference, and accelerometer records, will be\nsent to the coordinating center for data entry and data\ncleaning.\nThe evaluation study in the five countries will focus on\ncomprehensibility, readability, relevance, credibility, and\nattractiveness of the intervention materials, next to pre-\nliminary evaluation of effects on EBRB and potential\nbehavioral determinants. The effectiveness of the inter-\nvention is evaluated in a pre-test-post-test design, includ-\ning an intervention and a control condition. This\npreliminary evaluation is conducted in a school-random-\nized controlled design. The intervention will be imple-\nmented in five schools, with two classes per school, in\neach of countries, and the results are compared to a five\ncontrol schools in each country. Schools will be randomly\nallocated to intervention or control.\nWe aim for inclusion of approximately 2500 children in\nthe preliminary evaluation study. Power calculations\nbased on previous studies of school-based interventions\nindicate that this sample size is sufficient to detect rele-\nvant changes in EBRB, i.e. a 5% difference in change\nbetween intervention and control group, and their deter-\nminants [22].\nEvaluation will be based on surveys among the partici-\npating children and their parents before and after the\nintervention has been implemented and on question-\nBrug et al.

The survey questionnaire and\nmeasurement protocols will be similar to those used in\nWP 7, but enriched with process evaluation questions.\nDiscussion\nThe ENERGY-project applies the Intervention Mapping\nprotocol informed by the Environmental Research\nFramework for Weight gain Prevention. The ENERGY-\nproject aims to develop a school-based, family-involved\nintervention scheme to promote healthful EBRB in 10-12\nyear old school-aged children from countries located in\ndifferent regions of Europe.\nPotential strengths of the ENERGY-project are the mul-\ntidisciplinary ENERGY consortium; the range of coun-\ntries involved; the range of potential determinants of\nEBRB covered; as well as the stepwise development and\ntesting of an intervention scheme informed by a mixed\nmethods analysis of EBRB, their potential determinants\nand promising intervention strategies.\nThe ENERGY-consortium brings together a multidisci-\nplinary team of experts on public health, epidemiology,\nhuman nutrition, physical activity, psychology, and health\neconomics, totaling 14 partners, from 11 countries.\nThese countries represent the North, West, South and\nEastern parts of the European Union, including countries\nthat lack data on EBRB and potential determinants\namong schoolchildren. The cross-European design of the\nENERGY study will allow unique comparisons in EBRB\nand their correlates between countries and regions.\nThe fact that ENERGY focuses on a broad range of per-\nsonal cognitive as well as family environmental and\nschool environmental factors as potential determinants\nof EBRB is another potential strength of the study. Not\nmany studies have done so in an international setting.\nENERGY will use different methods to carefully analyze\nwhich EBRB are most relevant; which behavioral deter-\nminants are supported by evidence; and which interven-\ntion strategies mediate intervention effects. The\ninformation from these analyses will inform the develop-\nment of the ENERGY intervention scheme focusing on\nsimilar schemes in terms of intervention strategies and\nactivities across countries, but where necessary tailored\nto the national situation. Such a stepwise approach is\noften not possible within the tight time-schedule of\nbehavioral nutrition and physical activity intervention\nstudies.\nAnother strength of ENERGY is the fact that we will\nhave objectively measured weight, height and waist cir-\ncumferences of the participating children, and objective\nassessments of physical activity using accelerometers in a\nsub-sample of children.\nENERGY also has several potential weaknesses or\nthreats, and the time-schedule as well as the measure-\nments are among these. The stepwise approach is only\npossible because the different steps are organized in dif-\nferent WPs, with many centers and researchers involved.\nBecause the next WP is often partly dependent on the\nresults of the previous one, working according to plan\nand the set timelines is of utmost importance. Although\nwe obtain some objective measures, many of the mea-\nsures taken are based on self-reports of children and their\nparents. Such self-reports may be liable to social desir-\nability and recall bias. School-based surveys need to be\ncompleted in one school hour. The number of items that\ncan be included in the questionnaire is therefore tightly\nrestricted. Therefore, many of the potential determinants\nare assessed with few or even single-item measures, pos-\nsibly reducing reliability.\nA third weakness is the fact that the ENERGY survey is\ncross-sectional. This means that we will be able to\nexplore correlates of EBRB, but not predictors or true\ndeterminants. Fortunately, the cross-sectional survey will\nbe followed-up by an intervention study in which manip-\nulation of the presumed determinants will be attempted,\nand a longitudinal design will be applied to test effects. A\nweakness of this intervention study is that we will be able\nto assess short-term results and intermediary effects only.\nNevertheless, we believe that the ENERGY-project with\nits cross-European approach is a unique endeavor to\nstudy EBRB, their potential determinants, and to develop\nand test an obesity prevention intervention scheme\nfocusing on personal, family environmental and school\nenvironmental factors in different European countries.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJB and StV designed the study at large, JB and ASS drafted the manuscript.
