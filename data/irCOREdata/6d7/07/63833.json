The method is rapid compared with other \napproaches, taking typically less than 24 hours for a single determination. Cylindrical Chalk \ncores approximately 25 mm high by 25 mm in diameter, which are routinely used in porosity \nand permeability measurements and which had been pre-equilibrated with a 200 mg\/L \nchloride solution, were sealed at both ends and attached to a slowly rotating spindle \nsuspended in a reservoir. A chloride ion selective electrode (ISE) connected to a data logger \nwas used to record chloride diffusion out of the core. DA was estimated by analysing the \nchange in chloride concentration in the reservoir with time. Diffusion coefficients were \nestimated for six Chalk samples from a range of Chalk lithologies. Sample porosities for these \nChalks ranged from 32-48% and gas permeabilities from 0.3-8.2 \u000210-9 m2. The DA was found \nto vary from 3.1-8.7 \u0002 10-10 m2\/s, a similar range to that observed by others. A bromide ISE \nwas also used on one sample and found to give a similar DA to that obtained for chloride. This \napproach, which combines a rigorous mathematical model of diffusion with a relatively \nsimple practical method, could easily be adapted for other ions and for other consolidated \nporous media. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n1.1 Background \nThe Chalk is the major aquifer in the UK accounting for 70% of groundwater used and 33% \nof the total water used in England and Wales (UK Groundwater Forum, 2003). The \nmechanisms of movement of water and solutes through the Chalk are complex, although the \nnature of the overall groundwater flow regime has been well documented (Foster and Milton, \n1974; Price, 1987).  \nThe Chalk is a soft microporous fractured limestone and can be conceptualised as having \nthree components of porosity and permeability: (i) the Chalk has high intergranular porosity \n(25\u201345%) (Bloomfield et al., 1995) but only low intergranular permeability since the pore-\nneck sizes are typically less than 1 \u03bcm (Price et al., 1976); (ii) primary fractures that have low \nporosity (0.1-1%) but which can, depending on frequency, increase the hydraulic conductivity \nby two or three orders of magnitude (MacDonald and Allen, 2001), and (iii) secondary \n 1\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \nfractures that result from the solution and enlargement of primary fractures and which can \naccount for the bulk of the flow in the saturated zone (Price et al., 1982). \nThe major physical processes controlling the movement of solutes in the secondary fractures \nare generally assumed to be advection and dispersion, whereas in the matrix these processes \nare assumed to be insignificant. However, movement of solutes can take place in the matrix \nby diffusion. \nDiffusion in solution is the process whereby ionic or molecular constituents move from an \narea of high concentration (strictly activity) to an area of low concentration (strictly activity) \nunder the influence of the random kinetic motion of the constituent molecules or ions. \nDiffusion occurs without any bulk water movement. If the solution is flowing, diffusion is a \nmechanism (along with mechanical dispersion) that can cause the mixing of ionic and \nmolecular constituents. Diffusion ceases only when there is no longer a concentration \ngradient, i.e. it continues until there is a uniform concentration everywhere. \nThe rate of diffusion is of great importance for pollution studies. For example, although the \ndominant flow in the Chalk is through secondary fractures, contaminants in the fracture water \ncan diffuse into the relatively immobile matrix water. The matrix will, therefore, partially \nattenuate a contaminant plume. The effectiveness of this depends, amongst other factors, on \nfracture aperture, spacing and geometry (Barker and Foster, 1981). However, once the \ncontaminant plume has passed through the fractures, the concentration gradient will reverse \nso that the matrix porewater contaminants will diffuse out from the matrix and into the \nfracture water. This effect prolongs the remediation of contaminated Chalk (Fretwell et al., \n2005). \nThere have been many studies to determine diffusion coefficients in sediments. Van Rees et \nal. (1991) compared laboratory techniques based on three approaches: (i) diffusion from a \nspiked reservoir into sediment; (ii) diffusion from a spiked sediment into a reservoir, and (iii) \ndiffusion from a spiked sediment into an unspiked sediment: (i) above is the most \nstraightforward in practice. A study by Myrand et al. (1992) used such an approach to study \nthe diffusion of a range of volatile organic compounds through clay with experiments lasting \nup to 30 days. The study by Hill (1984) adopted a slightly different approach. He measured \nthe diffusion of a range of anions from a reservoir, across a Chalk disk, and into another \nreservoir. These experiments lasted approximately 40 days. Feenstra et al (1984) used a \nsimilar approach to Hill (1984) and determined diffusion coefficients for chloride by fixing \nsandstone discs between a two compartment diffusion cell. Measurements were made \nperiodically during the seven day duration of the tests using an ion-selective electrode. Barone \net al (1992a) used a similar design of diffusion cell to obtain diffusion coefficients for a range \nof organic compounds through clay plugs. In the cells a source solution was allowed to \ndiffuse through the plug of test material and into a collector solution for a period of 14 days. \nDuring this time samples were taken from both the source and collector reservoirs. Similar \napproaches have been used more recently by Polak et al. (2002) and Witth\u00fcser et al. (2003).  \n \nIn a different series of experiments Barone et al (1992b) determined diffusion coefficients for \ndiffusion out of chloride rich mudstones into a reservoir of distilled water. These tests were \nrun for up to 34 days after which time the sample was sectioned and the chloride porewater \nconcentration profile measured. Van der Kamp et al (1996) and Novakowski and van der \nKamp (1996) use a radial diffusion method to determine effective diffusion coefficients. The \ndiffusion cell comprised a cylindrical sample of saturated porous material encased in a rigid \nimpermeable tube, with rigid impermeable seals at top and bottom. A hole was drilled along \nthe axis of the sample to create a central reservoir for the test solution. Samples were taken \n 2\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nfrom the reservoir for chemical analysis over a period of at least 40 days. The change in \nconcentration of solutes in the reservoir enabled the determination of the effective diffusion \ncoefficient. Sophisticated tomographic procedures have also been recently used to monitor \ndiffusion in aquifer materials (Betson et al., 2005). \n \nIn this paper we present a method for determining the apparent diffusion coefficient for \nchloride in consolidated porous media. Using an ion selective electrode we measure the \nchange in concentration with time in an aqueous reservoir surrounding a cylindrical core plug \nthat has been pre-equilibrated with a chloride solution. As chloride diffuses out of the core the \nconcentration in the reservoir increases. This new method is both experimentally rapid, taking \nless than 24 hours, and is simple to carry out with relatively unsophisticated equipment. \n1.2 Diffusion Coefficients 13 \nDiffusion obeys Fick\u2019s first and second laws and is described by a diffusion coefficient. There \nare several different types of diffusion coefficient. The first major distinction is the phase or \nphases involved: gas, liquid and solid. The second distinction defines the type of medium \ninvolved: self-diffusion (one molecule amongst similar ones), tracer diffusion (a minor \nconstituent within a major one), or interdiffusion (diffusion between two or more different \nreservoirs). With ions, there is also the issue of whether local charge neutrality is maintained \nor not. There is therefore significant room for confusion over the meaning of the term \ndiffusion coefficient. Several related parameters are in common use reflecting the different \ntypes of diffusion and the precise meaning of the term being used is often not clear. A brief \nsummary of the various definitions is given below for the case when surface diffusion is \nnegligible and the concentration is low so that diffusion is independent of concentration and \nthe activity coefficient is close to one. \nFick\u2019s first law applied to the diffusion of a solute in water (or any other solvent) relates the \ndiffusive flux, JDiff, directly to the gradient of the concentration, c. For one-dimensional \ntransport in the x direction for steady state diffusion: \ndx\ndcDJ TDiff \u0003\u0004      (1) 29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \nwhere DT is normally termed the \u2018tracer\u2019 (or free-water) diffusion coefficient. (The term \n\u2018self-diffusion\u2019 applies only to the diffusion of solutes in the presence of identical solutes, but \nis often erroneously used to refer to free-water diffusion). \nThe above equation also applies to a saturated porous medium, but a smaller diffusion \ncoefficient, DE, must be used because of the impediment to transport caused by the matrix. \nThe terms \u2018effective\u2019 and \u2018intrinsic\u2019 have been used to describe the coefficient, DE. \n \nAnother value, the \u2018apparent\u2019 diffusion coefficient, DA, arises when time-dependent \ndiffusion in a porous medium is described by Fick\u2019s second law: \n \n2\n2\nx\nc\nD\nt\nc\nA \u0005\n\u0005\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0005\n      (2) 40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n \nOur usage is closer to that used in fields such as chemical engineering than the common usage \nin the environmental science literature. In order to avoid ambiguity with definitions, it is \nadvisable to ensure that the appropriate diffusion equation is closely associated with diffusion \ncoefficient data, e.g. as a footnote. \n 3\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n18 \n21 \n24 \n25 \n \nWhile DT, DE and DA are perhaps best regarded as empirical parameters, their interrelations \nare often expressed in terms of other parameters of porous medium: a thorough treatment is \nprovided by Ohlsson and Neretnieks (1995) and by Grathwohl (1998).  For example we could \nwrite, DE = DT \u0006t \u0007\/\b2 where \u0006t is the transport porosity, \u0007 is the constrictivity, and \b is the \ntortuosity.  When there is linear sorption, characterized by a distribution coefficient Kd  and\ndensity \t, some authors would write DA = DE \/ (\u0006 + \tKd ) where and \u0006 is the accessible (or \n\u2018storage\u2019) porosity.  (The two porosities, \u0006 and \u0006t , can differ significantly due to the presence \nof dead-end pores.)  The consideration of surface diffusion and nonlinear sorption result in \nmore complex relationships   \n \n1.3 Mathematical Model 12 \nWe make the following assumptions about the behaviour of the diffusion cell: \n1. Diffusion in the core is described by Fick's laws with a constant diffusion coefficient; 16 \n2. Diffusive exchange takes place only across the cylindrical surface of the core, the planar 17 \nend surfaces being sealed; \n3. The water in the vessel outside the core is well mixed; 19 \n4. Measurements of concentration in the vessel water are made passively (i.e. without 20 \naffecting the concentration or volume of solution); \n5. The water within the matrix of the core is immobile; 22 \n6. Sorption is negligible.   23 \nThese assumptions lead to the following equation for the variation of concentration, cc(r,t), at \na radial distance r from the axis of the core at time t: \n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\r\n\u000e\n\u000f\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\nr\nc\nr\nrr\nD\n=\nt\nc cAc  (3) 26 \n27 \n28 \nwhere DA is the apparent diffusion coefficient.  This equation is an example of Fick\u2019s second \nlaw. The following equation describes the rate of change on concentration, cV(t) in the vessel: \nR\nc\nE\nV\nr\nc\nRLD2=\nt\nc\nV\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0005\n\u0010  (4) 29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nwhere V is the annular volume, R is the core radius, L is the core length, and DE is the \neffective diffusion coefficient.  The last term is essentially Fick\u2019s first law. \n \nThe initial conditions are that the concentration is constant both in the vessel: \n\u0011 \u0012 00 VV c=c  (5) 34 \n35 and in the core pore water \n\u0011 \u0012 00 cc c=x,c . (6) 36 \n37 Finally, there is the boundary condition of equal concentrations at the face of the rock core: \n 4\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n\u0011 \u0012 \u0011 \u0012tc=t,c Vc 0  (7) 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n \nThe solution of the above five equations is readily obtained as the Laplace transform with \nrespect to time of the external solution concentration in the vessel: \n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\r\r\n\u000e\n\u000f\n\u0003\u0013\u0004 \u0014,f)()( 000\nc\ncVcV t\ntccctc  (8) 5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nwhere the function f represents the pore water concentration relative to the difference between \nthe initial concentrations and declines from f(0,\u0014)=1 to f(\u0015,\u0014)=1\/(1+\u0014) in an infinitely long \nexperiment  This function has a Laplace transform: \n\u0011 \u0012 \u0011 \u0012 \u0011 \u0012\u0016 \u0017p+pde=p\np\nB1\n1,f,f\n0 \u0014\n\b\u0014\b\u0014 \b \u0004\u0018\n\u0015\n\u0003  (9) 9 \n10 where \nA\nc D\nR\n=t\n4\n2\n (10) 11 \nV\nDLDR= AE \/\n2\u0010\u0014  (11) 12 \n13 and \n)2(I\n)2(I)B(\n0\n1\nxx\nxx \u0004  (12) 14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \nwhere I0 and I1 are modified Bessel functions. \nThe dimensionless quantity \u0014 can be interpreted as the ratio of water volumes in the core and \nvessel since the ratio DE\/DA should equal the accessible porosity, \u0006, assuming negligible \nsorption.  The time tc represents the characteristic time for diffusion across the core.   \n \nThe function B(x) was described by Barker (1985a, 1985b) in general terms.  In particular, it \nis readily shown that the above solution can be translated to the solution for other \u2018core\u2019 \ngeometries by: (a) replacing the function B(x) with an expression appropriate to the particular \ngeometry; (b) defining tc in more general terms as b2\/DA where b is the ratio of core volume to \nsurface area in contact with the vessel water, and (c) retaining \u0014 as the ratio of vessel to pore \nwater volumes. \n \nFor small times the following approximation is obtained \nVt\nt-- \n\u0010\u0010\n\b\u0014\u0014\b 2121),f( \u0004\u0019  (13) 28 \n29 \n30 \nwhere \n2\/\u0014\u0004 cV tt  (14) \n 5\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \nThis new characteristic time, tV, is of the order of magnitude of the time for diffusion into a \nmatrix volume equal to that of the water in the vessel.

METHOD \n \nOur apparatus was designed to use the Chalk plugs commonly used for determining porosity \nand permeability. In principle, our technique can be used to measure the diffusion coefficient \nof any solute, but here we describe its use only for chloride and bromide ions. \nThe apparatus (Fig.1) consists of a reaction vessel, maintained at 25.0 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C by a circulating \nwater bath with the temperature controlled by a solid-state thermostat and heater. A chloride \n(Model Orion 9317, Thermo Electron Corporation)  (or bromide,  Model Orion 9635, Thermo \nElectron Corporation) ion selective electrode (ISE) and double junction reference electrode \n(Model Ref 451, Radiometer Analytical), both interfaced to a PC-based data logger, were \nsuspended in the vessel. This enabled the continuous monitoring of chloride ion activities (or \nconcentrations). The calomel reference electrode was separated from the reaction vessel by a \npumped salt bridge containing 0.01M KNO3 in order to avoid cross-contamination. An \napproximately 25 mm \u0002 25 mm diameter cylindrical Chalk plug was suspended within the \nvessel and driven by a small electric motor. The Chalk plug was attached to the motor by \nspecially-made plastic connectors attached with a non-reactive adhesive. This also formed a \ncomplete seal. Such seals were applied to both end surfaces. The relatively small changes in \nconcentration involved mean that the apparatus is best suited to monitoring diffusion out of a \ncore rather than diffusion into it. \nAs most UK groundwaters are relatively dilute electrolyte solutions \u2013 conductivities are \ntypically in the range 500-1500 \u03bcS\/cm (Edmunds et al., 1989) indicating ionic strengths of \napproximately 10-20 mmol\/L) \u2013 variations in ionic strength were assumed to have no \nsignificant effect on the apparent diffusion coefficient. \n2.1 Core Saturation \nAll samples were taken from a single borehole drilled in the south of England into the Chalk \naquifer. Basic aquifer properties of the tested samples are given in Table 1. \nChalk-saturated water and calibration standards were prepared and stored in a room \nmaintained at 23\u00b0. The use of Chalk-saturated water minimised any subsequent dissolution of \nthe Chalk matrix. The difference in temperature between this temperature and the temperature \nof the experiment (25.0\u00b0C) had a minimal impact on the estimated diffusion coefficients. The \nequilibrated solution was filtered through a 0.45 \u0002m filter to exclude any large particles. \nSmall-diameter cores were cut and then dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C for approximately 1 week. \nThe core was placed in a desiccator and evacuated for 2 days. The sample was then saturated \n(as the vacuum was released) with a 200 mg\/L chloride solution and allowed to equilibrate for \n5-6 days before being finally weighed to ensure saturation.  \n2.2 Electrode Calibration \nKCl calibration solutions were prepared in decade intervals ranging from 10-1-10-4 molar \nusing Chalk-saturated water. This 'matrix matching' ensured that readings from the chloride \nISE could be converted directly to concentrations. Calibration solutions were placed in a 50 \nml reaction vessel maintained at 25.0\u00b0C. Each solution was placed in the reaction vessel in \nturn, mV responses being noted after the electrode had stabilized (<0.02 mV\/min). Further \ndetails of the data logging equipment are given in Kinniburgh et al. (1995). \n 6\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n2.3 Experimental Method 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \nAfter calibration of the electrode, the reaction vessel was filled with sufficient Chalk- \nsaturated distilled water to just cover the electrodes when the Chalk plug was placed in the \nvessel. This normally required ~26 ml although this varied depending on the precise size of \nthe core. The greater the ratio of matrix pore volume to exterior solution volume, the greater \nand the more rapid the monitored increase in concentration. The Chalk plug was removed \nfrom the chloride solution in which it had been equilibrating and excess water carefully \nremoved with a dry tissue. The Chalk was then suspended in a reservoir by a rod to a stirrer \nand allowed to rotate slowly. The electrode response was then monitored. The data logger was \nconfigured to take a reading every 30 seconds for the first hour and every minute thereafter. \nThe experiment was deemed to have ended when the measured concentration was within 70% \nof the theoretical maximum concentration. This generally took approximately 20 hours and \nnever exceeded 30 hours. \nAt the end of the experiment, the calibration solutions were again measured in order to \ndetermine the amount (if any) of electrode drift that had occurred during the experiment. The \nshort experiment times generally resulted in minimal electrode drift, generally <0.5mV \nbetween  pairs of calibration solutions at the experiment start and end and with no systematic \nincrease or decrease in response for any given experiment . Experiments were carried out on \nduplicate cores, that is, two cores taken adjacently from the same chalk block in an attempt to \nminimise the effects of any natural heterogeneity. \nThe use of ISE\u2019s to monitor solute concentrations in the exterior solution has the advantage \nthat no sample needs to be removed from the reaction vessel for analysis. This simplifies the \nsubsequent data analysis. \n2.4 Calculation of DA\nThe apparent diffusion coefficient (DA) was estimated by fitting the measured chloride data to \nEqn (8). The optimization was carried out using a derivative-free nonlinear least squares \nalgorithm based on  Powell\u2019s VA05 algorithm from the HSL Archive (HSL Archive, 2005). \nThis uses a hybrid approach based on a combination of Newton\u2019s method, steepest descent \nand the Marquadt-Levenberg algorithm. Input parameters for the model were the \nconcentration of the saturating solution, the core dimensions in terms of radius and length and \nthe core porosity. Only DA was adjusted for best fit. Optimisation was most effective when \nbased on fitting log DA rather than DA directly. \n \nEquation (13) can be used as an alternative method of analysis to check the results obtained \nwith the least-squares analysis.

The line marked at 43.9 mg\/L is the theoretical maximum concentration that \ncan be achieved when both solutions (i.e. the matrix pore water and the external solution in \nthe annulus) are fully mixed. The fitted curve asymptotically approaches this value. All model \nfits gave an R2 of greater than 0.99. Such good fits give confidence that normal Fickian \ndiffusion is occurring. \nThe results (Table 2) are similar to those found by Hill (1984), although our data have been \nobtained in a much shorter timescale compared with Hill (1 day compared with 40 days). Hill \n(1984) found a clear linear relationship between log \u0006 and DA and a similar relationship is \nobserved here even if the samples with the highest DA fall off the linear trend. A much better \npositive correlation is observed  between gas permeability and DA. In this case the whole data \nset can be well described by by a second order polynomial with an R2 greater than 0.99. \nA similar experiment to that described above was also carried out on sample 6 using a \nbromide ISE. DA for bromide of 3.5 \u0002 10-10 m2\/s was found compared with an average of 3.4 \n\u0002 10-10 m2\/s for chloride. The literature tracer diffusion coefficient for chloride is \n0.199 \u0002 10-10 m2\/s and that for bromide 0.202 \u0002 10-10 m2\/s (Robinson and Stokes, 1968) and \nso the lack of a significant difference in our estimated DA\u2019s is not surprising. The difference in \nmolecular size between the chloride and bromide ions (181 pm compared with 196 pm) \ntherefore has no observable effect on DA.  \nResidual errors are very small although in the example shown (Fig. 2) the residuals clearly \nshow a systematic trend. This either indicates a shortcoming in the model or a systematic \nerror in one of the experimental or model parameters. We found that other experimental runs \ndid not always show this trend. Four possible sources of error are: (i) random and systematic \nerrors in the measurement of chloride by an ISE; (ii) the assumed porosity; (iii) the assumed \ninitial chloride concentration (based on a gravimetric method of preparation), and (iv) the \nmeasured dimensions of the Chalk plug.  \nModel simulations show that a 2% absolute error in porosity measurement (i.e. 49% porosity \nagainst 50%) can alter the calculated diffusion coefficient by approximately 5%. A 2% error \nin measuring the core radius (for cores of this size \u00b1 0.2mm) also leads to a 5% change in the \ncalculated DA. A 1% error in measuring the initial concentration (i.e. 198 mg\/L chloride as \nopposed to 200 mg\/L) leads to a 3% change in the calculated DA. Cumulatively these errors \nare less than the error between duplicates (Table 2), which are still in themselves, reasonable \nand fit for purpose.  \nThe random error is minimised in the procedure by the large number of observations while \nthe systematic error (drift) is minimised by the short duration of the experiments. The 70% of \nmaximum concentration threshold chosen provides a good compromise which ensures that \nsufficient data are collected while keeping the overall experimental time, and the electrode \ndrift, to a minimum. \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS 41 \nA method has been developed that enables the rapid determination of the apparent diffusion \ncoefficient of a solute, DA, in Chalk rock. DA ranged from 3.1\u20138.7 \u0002 10-10 m2\/s in six Chalk \nsamples which varied in porosity from 32-48% and whose gas permeability ranged from 0.3-\n8.2 \u000210-9 m2. \n 8\nDevelopment of a Rapid Method for Determining Apparent Diffusion Coefficients in Chalk\/revised \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \nThe approach has been shown to work using both chloride and bromide ISEs, and in its \ncurrent form could be used for determining diffusion coefficients for any consolidated porous \nmedium and for any solute whose concentration can be accurately monitored in situ. The \nmethod might also be simplified by removing the ISE and taking 3-4 small (0.5 mL) sub-\nsamples of water from the annulus surrounding the core at key time intervals (e.g. 4, 6, 8 and \n16 hours). The outward diffusion of solute would not be so well characterised but a good \nestimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient could still be obtained with a relatively small \neffort. This would enable DA to be determined for almost any ion or indeed a cocktail of \npossibly competing ions. Such an approach lends itself to \u2018mass production\u2019. \n \nAcknowlwedgements \nThe authors are grateful for a helpful review by John Bloomfield of BGS Wallingford.\nD C Gooddy and D G Kinniburgh publish with the permission of the Executive Director of \nthe British Geological Survey. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBarker J A, Foster S S D 1981.
