Introduction\nPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a well known member of the large family of\nperfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which are characterized by a fully fluorinated\nhydrophobic linear carbon chain attached to various hydrophilic heads. PFOS is also a\nfinal degradation product of a group of precursor PFCs (Lau et al., 2007). PFCs have\nbeen manufactured for over 50 years. As surfactants and surface protectors, these\nchemicals have been used as coatings in a wide range of industry and consumer\nproducts, including paper, carpets, leather, food containers and fabric. PFCs also act\nas performance chemicals in products such as fire-fighting foams, floor polishes, and\nshampoos(Renner, 2001; Olsen et al., 2005).\nOwing to the presence of the strong C-F bonds in their chemical structures, PFCs\nare stable against many chemical reactions and non-biodegradable in the environment\nand in activated sewage sludge(Brooke, 2004). The total global emission of PFOS is\nestimated to be 6.5-130 tones with 98% being in water and 2% in air(Rumsby et al.,\n2009). It has been reported that the level of PFOS in the rivers in China ranged from\nless than 1 ng\/l to greater than 20 ng\/l, reflecting the difference in environmental\nrelease from different regions (So et al., 2007; Chen, 2009). The samples from the\nriver near Shanghai have the highest PFOS level, which is in concordance with the\nfact that there are many PFC manufacturers\/users in and around Shanghai(Chen,\n2009). The levels of PFCs in the lakes\/rivers and drink waters are very similar,\nindicating the ineffectiveness of current water treatment in removing these\n4chemicals(Rumsby et al., 2009).\nPFCs have been shown to accumulate in animals including humans. A mean\nelimination half-life of 5.4 years has been reported(Olsen et al., 2007). The blood\nconcentration of PFOS varies greatly between different regions and countries. It\nappeared that among the several countries, China has the highest blood concentration\nof PFOS(Chen, 2009). Several PFCs including PFOS can bind to and therefore\nactivate the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR\u03b1) (of human, rat\nand mouse), which forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and binds to\nPPAR response elements (PPREs) within the promoter regions of many genes. These\ngenes are involved in a number of biological processes including lipid metabolism\nand utilization, inflammation, fetal growth, hormone and immune function(Rosen et\nal., 2009). They may also play roles in cancer development(Lau et al., 2007).\nBased on its environmental behavior and human health effect, PFOS has been\nclassified as very persistent, very bioaccumulative and toxic by the EU. Consequently,\nthe use of PFOS has been restricted and will eventually end in EU countries as early\nas practical(2006a). Similar regulatory measures have also been taken in the United\nStates(2002; 2006b). Nevertheless, the wide and persistent presence of PFOS in the\nenvironment presents a continuous threat to human health particularly in China, where\nthe activities in manufacturing and use of PFCs have increased during the last two\ndecade(Chen, 2009). Continues monitoring of PFOS in environmental waters is\nnecessary for evidence based policy making to protect environment and human health.\nMost conducted PFC\/PFOS monitoring programmes have mainly relied on the\n5application of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass\nspectrometry (HPLC\/MS). Although current state of the art HPLC\/MS has detection\nlimits well below 1 ng\/l as summarized by(Zhang et al., 2010), the need for accessing\nto the immobile and expensive equipments has hampered its use in a wide range of\nconditions. More convenient, cost effective and high throughput alternatives are\ndesirable for large scale environmental water monitoring. The aim of the present study\nwas to develop a bioassay for detecting and monitoring the concentration of PFOS in\nenvironmental water, based on the interaction of PFOS with PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 combined\nwith the use of quantum dots (QD) nanoparticles as a fluorescent marker. The QD\nwere conjugated with streptavidin (SA) that can bind to the PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 probes\nlabeled with biotin.\nAlthough the sensitivity of the bioassay is lower compared with HPLC\/MS, it is\nconvenient, low cost, and allows rapid and high throughput detection. Such detection\nmethod is particularly useful for rapid screening for samples with concentration of\nPFOS higher than 2.5 ng\/l.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1 Reagents and chemicals\nAll HPLC purified oligonucleotide probes labeled by biotins were synthesized by\nSangon Biotechnology Inc. (Shanghai, China). Quantum dots streptavidin conjugate\n6(QD-SA) kit was purchased from JiaYuan Quantum Dots Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China).\nQD-SA was diluted at 1:1000 in diluting buffer and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. PFOS was\npurchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and\ndextran coated charcoal were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO,\nUSA). Rabbit polyclonal PPAR\u03b1 antibody (SC-9000) was purchased from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). All reagents for nuclear extraction were\nobtained from Roche Ltd. (Mannheim, Germany). Ultra-pure water (18 M\u03a9,\nBarnstead International) was used to prepare all the solutions. Black 96-microwell\nplates were purchased from Nunc Co., Ltd (Denmark).\n2.2 Preparation of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1\nThe PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 was extracted from the liver of male Sprague Dawley rat\naccording to the protocol described by Crinelli (Baptista et al., 2006). 20 \u00b5l aliquots\nof nuclear extracts were stored at -80\u00b0C until use.\n2.3 Preparation of biotin -modified probes for PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 binding\nA pair of DNA probes tagged with biotin were designed and synthesized\naccording to the PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 heterodimer binding corequence (sense:\nbiotin-5\u2019-AAAAACTGGGTCAAAGGTCT-3\u2019, antisense:\nbiotin-5\u2019-AGACCTTTGACCCAGTTTTT-3\u2019')(Juge-Aubryet al., 1997). The\n7synthetic single-stranded probes were dissolved in sterile TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL,\n1 mM EDTA, pH=8.0) and melted in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM\nEDTA, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) at 72\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by cooling to 60\u00b0C for 1.5\nmin, further to 45\u00b0C for 1 min and 10\u00b0C for 3 min in a thermal cycler(Wang et al.,\n2003; Li et al., 2006).\n2.4 PFOS-BSA and PPAR\u03b1 antibody coating in 96 -microwell plates\nPFOS-BSA was prepared according to the methods as described previously(Jones\net al., 2003). PFOS and BSA were first mixed at concentrations of 1 mM and 1.2 mM\nrespectively for 2 hr and then 0.025% of dextran coated charcoal was added in order\nto absorb the free PFOS. After 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 10000 g for 10\nmin and the supernatant, which contained PFOS-BSA at concentration of 0.5 mM,\nwas collected. For coating with PFOS-BSA, 96-well black plates were filled with 200\n\u00b5l\/well PFOS-BSA diluted to 1 \u00b5M in coating buffer (NaHCO3\/Na2CO3,50 mM,\npH=9.6). The plates were stored at 4\u00b0C for 12 hr before the supernatants were\nremoved and washed with PBS-Tween 20 (8 mM, pH=7.6, 0.05% Tween 20) for 3\ntimes. The plates were also treated with blocking Buffer (1% BSA) for 2 hr.\nFor coating with PPAR\u03b1 antibody, the 96-well plates were filled with 200 \u00b5l\/well\nantibody at dilution of 1:400 in coating buffer (NaHCO3\/Na2CO3, 50 mM, pH=9.6).\nThe rest of the coating procedure was the same as described above.\n82.5 Quantum dots bioassay for PFOS detection\nPFOS standards were made by dissolving PFOS in the pure water containing\n0.05% DMSO at concentrations of 2.5 ng\/l, 5 ng\/l, 12.5 ng\/l, 40 ng\/l, 50 ng\/l\uff0cand 75\nng\/l. The solution without PFOS was used as control. 200 \u00b5l of each of the PFOS\nstandards and 2 \u00b5l of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 extract were added to the 96-well plate coated\nwith PFOS-BSA. The plate was placed on a shaker for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C to allow full\ncombination of both free PFOS and PFOS-BSA with PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1. The supernatants\nthat containing the complex of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1-PFOS were then transferred to another\nplate coated with PPAR\u03b1 antibody. The plate was incubated for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C to\nallow the reaction of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1-PFOS with the antibody. After discarding the\nsupernatants and washing the plate with PBS-Tween 20 for 3 times, 100 \u00b5l \/well\n2\u00d7nucleoprotein binding buffer and 75 \u00b5l \/well Ultra-pure water were added to the\nplate. The plate was incubated for 30 min before 25 \u00b5l of biotin labeled DNA probe\n(100 mM ) was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C to allow\nthe probe to bind with PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1-PFOS. The QDs-SA was diluted at 1:1000 in\nTBS and 200 \u00b5l\/well added. After 2 hr incubation at 4\u00b0C, the result was processed by\nan automatic fluorescence microplate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths\nof 400 nm and 605 nm, respectively, according to the peak value of the QDs\u2019\nabsorption and emission spectra (Fig.1).\n2.6 PFOS detection by HPLC\/MS\n9PFOS standards were separated and quantified using an Agilent 1100 series\nHPLC\/MSD system modified with low dead volume tubing. Separation of compounds\nwas performed using a 150\u00d7 2.1mm (5 \u03bcm) Zobax Extend C18 column (Aligent\nTechnologies, U.S.A). A 5 \u03bcl aliquot of the sample extract was injected into a guard\ncolumn (XDB-C8, 2.1mmi.d.\u00d712.5mm, 5 \u03bcm; Agilent Technologies,U.S.A) that was\nsequentially connected to Zorbax Extend C18 column with 1 mM ammonium acetate\nsolution (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) as mobile phases, starting at 40% of\nsolvent B with flow rate of 0.2 ml\/min . At 2 min the solvent B concentration was\nincreased to 60% and held till 5 min when its concentration was increased to 75%,\nwhich was held until 11.5 min. The column temperature was kept constant at 40\u00b0C.\nPFOS standards were identified and quantified using selective ion monitoring\n(SIM) operating in negative electrospray ionization mode. The ion selected for\nmonitoring in this study was PFOS (m\/z 499). Retention times for PFOS were\nbetween 9.5 and 10.5 min. The desolvation gas temperature was 350\u00b0C at a flow rate\nof 10 L\/min. The collision cell was maintained at 30 psig. Capillary voltage was set at\n1500 V with a fragmentor voltage of 70 V. A dwell time of 0.8 s was used to monitor\nthe ions. Correlation between peak areas and analyte concentrations (2.5-75 ng\/l) was\ndetermined by linear regression with a relative correlation coefficient of 0.9978 .\n2.7 Recovery experiments\n10\nThe recovery experiments were conducted by spiking water samples with PFOS\nstandard. The water samples were then analyzed by Bioassay and by HPLC\/MS using\nthe same detection parameters as used for analysis of standard samples. The\nexperiments were repeated for 8 times and the recovery rates were calculated by\ncomparing the concentrations derived from spiking samples and the standard\nconcentration.\n2.8 Collection and pretreatment of environmental water samples\nTo minimize the adsorption of PFOS, plastic bottles made of polyethylene were\nused for sampling. The containers for sample collection were washed with n-hexane,\npetroleum ether and methanol before use according to GB\/T5750.2-2006.\nEnvironmental water samples were collected from the Yangtze River (Jiang\u2019an\nDistrict Wuhan, China), Han River in Wuhan, waterworks in Wuhan and bottled\npurified water in October 2009. The samples were taken at 20 cm below the water\nsurface in middle of Yangtze River and Han River. One little of water sample was\npretreated with filtration through 0.22 \u00b5m membrane to remove the solids in the water\nat the speed of 1 drop per second, and then run through the C18 adsorption column\nwith the help of pump so that PFOS in water can be absorbed on the column. The\ncolumn was washed with 5 ml of methanol, dried by high-purity nitrogen and\ndissolved in 1 ml of methanol. Due to its high sensitivity, the normal water samples\n11\nfor bioassay can be only pretreated with filtration through 0.22 \u00b5m membrane to\nremove the solids without the enrichment by Solid-Phase Extraction.\n2.9 Quantification of PFOS in environmental water samples with quantum dots\nbioassay and HPLC\/MS\nTo assess the reliability of the newly developed bioassay, the level of PFOS in\nwater samples was analyzed by the bioassay and compared with that derived with\nHPLC\/MS. Both assays were performed following the procedures as described\nabove.\n3. Results\n3.1 Scheme of the quantum dots bioassay\nBasic principle of this bioassay is shown in Fig.2. In this system, the free PFOS in\nwater samples will compete with the immobilized PFOS in 96-well ELISA plate for a\ngiven amount of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 (Fig 2.1 and 2.2). The level of the free PFOS in the\nsamples can then be determined indirectly by immobilizing the PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1-PFOS\ncomplex to another 96-well plate coated with PPAR\u03b1 antibody (Fig 2.3) and\nsubsequent measuring the level of PPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 by using the biotin-modified\nPPAR\u03b1-RXR\u03b1 probes-QD-SA detection system. The amount of PFOS is proportional\n12\nto the fluorescence intensity of QDs, therefore PFOS detection can be quantitatively\nachieved.\n3.2 Validation of the bioassay for PFOS\nTo validate the bioassay system, PFOS standard solutions were measured using\nboth the bioassay and HPLC\/MS. In the PFOS bioassay, the intensity of fluorescence\nfrom each well was linearly related with the PFOS concentrations ranging from 2.5\nng\/l to 75 ng\/l (y = 19.112x-23.995, R2 = 0.9642) (Fig.3). The intensity of\nfluorescence from blank control and standard concentration of 2.5ng\/l was 0.35 and\n1.31, respectively. The value of S\/N was about 3, so the detection limit of this method\nwas 2.5 ng\/l with the mean recovery being 107.8% (Fig.3).\nIn comparison, HPLC\/MS demonstrated a limit of detection of 1ng\/l and recovery\n104.3%. The concentration range from 2.5 ng\/l to 75ng\/l was within its detection\nlinear range \uff08y=2E-05x-26.479,R2 =0.9957\uff09(Fig.4).\n(Table. 1).\n3.3 Quantification of PFOS in environmental water samples with the bioassay and\nHPLC\/MS.\nTo further assess the reliability of the bioassay, 3 water samples per place\ncollected were detected for PFOS concentration and the results were compared with\n13\nthat determined by HPLC\/MS as shown in Table 1., suggesting that the novel bioassay\nis reliable for PFOS quantification. HPLC\/MS analysis also confirmed identity of the\nanalyst as PFOS (Fig.5).\n(Table.2).\n4. Discussion\nIn the present study, a novel bioassay has been successfully developed for\ndetection of PFOS in environmental water samples. In order to achieve reasonably\nhigh sensitivity, QD nanoparticles were used to enhance the signals for detection in\nthe bioassay system. Over traditional fluorophores, QD nanoparticles have several\nadvantages that include a long fluorescent lifetime, high fluorescent\nintensity(Ghasemi et al., 2009), broad excitation spectrum, narrow emission\nspectrum, and large separation between the excitation and emission\nwavelength(Baptista et al., 2006; Kjallman, 2008).\nThis study was initially designed for detection of PFOS, the method however can\nalso be applied for detection of several other PFCs that can bind to the PPAR\u03b1.\nAlthough the sensitivity of the bioassay is lower than HPLC\/MS, the QDs bioassay is\nrapid, convenient and high-throughput. It is particularly useful as a tool for rapid\nscreening for environmental water samples that contain high level concentration of\nPFCs. The actual identities and concentration of the detected PFCs can be further\nconfirmed using HPLC\/MS. The QDs bioassay can also be used to monitor large\n14\nnumber of residential drinking water samples for PFOS content and evaluate the\neffectiveness of PFOS-rich sewage treatment. If the concentration of PFOS in sewage\nsamples is higher than 75ng\/L, we can dilute them to 1\/10,1\/100,1:1000 or more\nbefore testing, and test them at one time for high-throughput of the bioassay. At last\none diluted sample must be in the detection range(2.5~75ng\/L), then we can calculate\nthe concentration according to the sample\u2019s dilution. Such detection method can\ntherefore serve as a complementary or an alternative tool to HPLC\/MS for PFC\ndetection and monitoring in environmental waters.\nThe increase in manufacturing and application of PFOS and related chemicals in\nChina during the last two decades has inevitably increased the release of these\nchemicals into environmental waters. In some areas, especially in regions with\nintensive industrial activities, the level usually exceeds above average. The level of\nPFOS has been detected even greater than 100 ng\/l in Pear River near the city of\nDongguan Guangdong province of China(So et al., 2007). The industries in this city\nwere heavily involved in the production of plastics, electrical equipments and\ntelecommunication equipments developed during 1980 and 1997(Nolan, 2001). Many\nof these industries could potentially involve the use of PFOS and other PFCs during\ntheir manufacturing processes. The level of PFOS in drinking water in Shanghai, the\nmost important special economic zone of china, was also found to be higher than 10\nng\/l(So et al., 2007).\nCurrent water purification practices, including slow sand filtration and\nchlorination, were ineffective in removing PFOS(Loos et al., 2007). Other methods\n15\nhave also been tried to increase the effectiveness of PFOS removing. Tang et al.\ninvestigated the use of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and nanofiltration (NF)\nmembranes to remove PFOS from wastewater. A greater than 99% and 90%\u201399%\nremoval was achieved with RO and NF membranes, respectively(Tang et al., 2006;\nTang et al., 2007). With the installation of granular activated carbon (GAC) system\ninto the wastewater treatment system of the PFOS production facility in Minnesota,\nPFOS was successfully removed from the effluent discharged into the Mississippi\nRiver. These new technologies, however, have not currently been well implemented.\nCombined with the ineffective wastewater treatment, the increase in the\nmanufacturing and use of PFOS and related chemicals pose a continuous threat to the\nenvironment and human health. Taken together, rigorous monitoring of PFOS in\nenvironmental and drinking waters with rapid, cost-effective and robust tool can help\nto evaluate the level of environment contamination and the effectiveness of water\ntreatment practice in PFOS and related chemical industries, benefiting both\nenvironment and human health.\n5. Conclusion\nWe have developed a QDs bioassay for convenient, cost effective and robust\ndetection of PFOS in water samples. This bioassay has detection limit of 2.5ng\/l with\nlinearity range of 2.5ng\/l-75ng\/l, providing an alternative to HPLC\/MS for detection\nand monitoring of PFOS in environmental water and drinking water, and also for\n16\nevaluating the effectiveness of water treatment for removing PFOS and related\nchemicals.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National High Technology Research and\nDevelopment Program of China (grant number 2006AA06Z401), the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (grant number 20677018, 20777022, 20807017), the\nKey Projects in the National Science and Technology Pillar Program (grant number\n2007BAC16B07) and the R&D Special Fund for Public Welfare Industry\n(Environment) (grant number 200709052).\n17\nReferences\n2002. 3M Phase-out Plan for POSF-Based Products.
