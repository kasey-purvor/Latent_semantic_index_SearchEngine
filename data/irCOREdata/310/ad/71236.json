This in turn af-\nfects the optoelectronic properties of the material and de-\nvices. As shown in Fig. 1, three deep levels sED, EA1, and\nEA2d located at 20 meV below the conduction band EC, 14\nand 35 meV above the valence band EV, respectively, are\nassociated with the most commonly observed transitions in\nlow temperature photoluminescence sPLd investigations of\nInAs.2,3 Furthermore, it is known that relatively high densi-\nties of structure defects and deep states arise in samples\ngrown using liquid phase epitaxy sLPEd at temperatures be-\nlow 550 \u00b0C.1 In this paper we report unusual negative dif-\nferential resistance sNDRd effects which involve the defect\nlevels within the band gap of the active region in InAs light-\nemitting diodes sLEDsd grown at low temperature and pro-\nvide evidence for the formation of a complex defect.\nThe InAs p-i-n LEDs were produced by LPE using a\nlow growth temperature of 455 \u00b0C. The samples were grown\nfrom In-rich solution on the p-type InAs s100d substrate\nwhich was Zn-doped to 131018 cm\u22123. One sample contain-\ning quantum dots sQDsd was grown at 455 \u00b0C with\n0.4 \u00b0C\/min ramping rate and layer contact times\nInAss20 sd \/ InSbs1 msd \/ InAss10 sd \/n+-InAss10 sd. All the\nthree InAs layers were grown using 30 \u00b0C supercooling, and\nonly the n+-InAs layer was intentionally doped with Te to\n131018 cm\u22123. The InSb QD layer was grown using 20 \u00b0C\nsupercooling. The total thickness of the epilayers was ap-\nproximately 4 mm. The resulting samples were fabricated\ninto 380 mm diameter mesa etched LEDs using conventional\nphotolithography and metallization techniques. The LED\nchips were mounted on to TO-49 diode headers and were\ncharacterised using a combination of constant and pulsed\ncurrent\u2013voltage sI\u2013Vd and electroluminescence sELd mea-\nsurements. Two types of LEDs were produced: sid conven-\ntional LEDs containing unintentionally doped InAs and siid\nwith a single layer of InSb quantum dots sQDd in the active\nregion, introduced using a rapid slider LPE technique where\nthe growth solution is quickly wiped across the substrate. sIn\nthe present case the QD layer was grown using a contact\ntime of 1 ms at 455 \u00b0Cd. The quantum dots obtained in this\nway were 5 nm in height and 20 nm in diameter with an area\ndensity of ,1010 cm\u22122.4\nThe I\u2013V test set-up, is shown in Fig. 1. A computer\ncontrolled I\u2013V measurement system was used based on a\nNational Semiconductor LM759CP power operational ampli-\nfier as a voltage source. Because of the negative resistance\nobtained in our devices, in order to excite electrolumines-\ncence, a supplementary circuit was used to provide dc bias to\nthe sample as shown in Fig. 1.

The EL\nwas dispersed by a Bentham M300 Monochromator, and de-\ntected using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detector and a\nStanford SR830 lock-in amplifier.\nWith reference to Fig. 1, it has been proposed that the\ndonor level ED in n-type InAs is related to the As vacancy\nsVAsd structure defect.5 The acceptor levels EA1 and EA2\noriginate from the doubly charged structure defect sVIn\n-InAsd, a complex of an In vacancy sVInd with an In antisite\ndefect sInAsd, which tends to form in p-type InAs.6,7 In a\nperfect InAs lattice, an In atom is bonded to four As atoms\nand vice versa. However, when an In atom exchanges posi-\ntion with a neighboring As atom, an antisite pair InAs\u2013AsIn is\nformed. The In atom on the antisite InAs is then bonded to\nthree In atoms and one As atom on the antisite AsIn, which\nshould generate an In vacancy sVInd to minimize energy sand\nvice-versad. Therefore, we suppose that it is possible to form\na structure defect complex composed of an antisite pair\nInAs\u2013AsIn and a vacancy pair VIn\u2013VAs fas shown in Fig.\n1sadg. The As vacancy sVAsd may attract an electron and in-\nteract with an As antisite sAsInd to form a deep donor state\nED. The In vacancy sVInd may attract a hole but is less likely\nto interact with an In antisite sInAsd due to the more localized\nwave function of the hole, thus it forms two deep acceptor\nstates EA1 and EA2 instead.\nFigure 2 clearly shows the negative differential resis-\ntance sNDRd effect, which is associated with tunnelling, ob-\nserved in the I\u2013V characteristics measured from each of the\nLEDs. At 77 K the forward bias current of the InAs LED\nincreases sublinearly with increasing bias voltage to\nP1s0.2020 V,152.9 mAd and drops to V1s0.2287 V,\n84.6 mAd, then slowly increases to P2s0.3417 V,91.0 mAd,\ndrops to V2s0.3693 V,22.8 mAd, and then increases again\nalmost linearly with increasing bias voltage. The NDR re-\ngion from P1 to V1 s68.3 mAd is almost equal to that from P2\nto V2 s68.2 mAd, but in a different current range. This im-\nplies that the NDR may involve a similar number of carriers\nor deep level states in two parallel channels8 and that the\ncorresponding donor and acceptor states ED\u2013EA1 and\nED\u2013EA2 could be associated in pairs within a complex.\nElectron tunnelling takes place from the n+-InAs layer to\nthe donor levels at ED s20 meV below Ecd and reaches a\npeak at P1. The voltage at P1 s152.9 mAd is 36 mV higher\nthan that in reverse bias at the same current. This means the\nvoltage drop across the undoped InAs active region in for-\nward bias is ,36 mV. The decrease in current from P1 to V1\nrelates to the off-resonant tunnelling into the donor states,\nand similarly the decrease from P2 to V2 relates to off-\nresonant tunnelling into the acceptor states, since EV\u2013EA2\ns35 meVd is roughly twice as large as EC\u2013ED s20 meVd con-\nsistent with Fig. 1.\nAt 300 K, the InAs LED swithout QD in the active re-\ngiond again shows a double NDR, but the total current only\ndecreased by 16% from P1 to V2, which is much less than at\n77 K s85%d. At 300 K most of the donor\u2013acceptor pairs in\nthe undoped InAs active layer are dissociated, the electrons\nand holes become thermally reactivated back into the respec-\ntive energy bands and are not available for tunnelling.\nAt 77 K, the I\u2013V peaks and valleys of the InSb QD LED\nare P1s0.1502 V,119.9 mAd, V1s0.1857 V,62.4 mAd,\nP2s0.3138 V,70.8 mAd, and V2s0.3444 V,11.3 mAd, re-\nspectively. The current drop from P1 to V1 is again similar to\nthat from P2 to V2, and the total current reduced by 90%\nfrom P1 to V2. At 300 K, in comparison with the values\nmeasured at 77 K, the current at P1 is significantly reduced\ns34%d as is the peak voltage. This is a direct consequence of\nthe presence of InSb QDs which have the effect of generat-\ning many additional local defects and corresponding strain-\nFIG. 3.

Although emission is obtained from these LEDs, no\nEL emission is observed from the QD themselves in these\ndevices.\nIn order to observe light emission, the QD LED was\nfirstly biased to 0.37 V at 20 mA dc, and then different pulse\ncurrents were superimposed. The resulting dependence of the\nEL at 5 K is shown in Fig. 3sad. At small PCA s,10 mAd\nonly peak B was observed, centered at 372 meV, corre-\nsponding to the transition from ED to EA2. However, due to\ncarrier filling effects at large PCA, peak B became saturated\nand peak A appeared centred at 392 meV, corresponding to\nthe transition from ED to EA1. We estimated that EA2 was\nfully filled at about 30 mA PCA+20 mA dc swhich is ap-\nproximately equivalent to 35 mA dc injectiond. Figure 3sbd\nshows the dependence of the EL spectra on dc injection at a\nfixed PCA of 10 mA. Peak B reached a maximum EL inten-\nsity at 19 mA dc injection with a transition energy of\n372 meV before peak A began to appear. The switching be-\nhavior of these two peaks with injection current suggests that\nthe corresponding radiative transitions are associated with\ncarriers recombining together within complexes containing\nthe respective structure defects associated with appropriate\ndonor and acceptor levels.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the integrated EL intensity increases\nalmost linearly in both small PCA s0\u201310 mAd and large\nPCA s10\u2013350 mAd regions using 20 mA dc injection, but\nthe slope at small PCA related to the 372 meV peak sBd is\nabout 4 times that observed using large PCA dominated by\nthe 392 meV peak sAd. On the other hand at fixed 10 mA\nPCA, the integrated EL intensity at small dc current\ns14\u201319 mAd is about 4 times that observed at large dc cur-\nrent s50\u2013150 mAd. Since the slope represents the LED dif-\nferential efficiency this suggests that the radiative efficiency\nof the 372 meV peak is about 4 times as high as that of the\n392 meV peak due to stronger confinement for the lower\nenergy transition in the complex. We suppose that the elec-\ntron and hole injected into VAs and VIn are strongly confined\nby the complex, and the corresponding donor\u2013acceptor pair\nED\u2013EA2 has stronger confinement than that of ED\u2013EA1.\nTherefore, the EL peak B exhibits a higher radiation effi-\nciency s4 times that of Ad, as well as intensity saturation at\nlarge injection. Furthermore, it is also insensitive to tempera-\nture in peak position and intensity up to 175 K. This is con-\nsistent with the characteristics of radiative recombination\noriginating from a complex which gives out intense lumines-\ncence that quenches slowly and persists up to high tempera-\nture.\nIn conclusion, negative differential resistance and elec-\ntroluminescence have been observed from InAs LEDs con-\ntaining InSb quantum dots grown by LPE at 455 \u00b0C. A com-\nplex structure defect composed of an antisite pair InAs\u2013AsIn\nand a vacancy pair VIn\u2013VAs has been suggested to account\nfor the experimental observations. The interaction of VAs and\nAsIn results in the formation of a deep donor state ED, while\nthe interaction of VIn and InAs generates two deep acceptor\nstates EA1 and EA2. Carriers may resonantly tunnel into the\ndeep states at small bias, which become filled by carrier in-\njection at large forward bias. At low temperature the EL\nefficiency of the 372 meV peak is about 4 times that of the\n392 meV peak. The electron-hole pair confined by the com-\nplex was observed to exhibit intense EL up to about 175 K.\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for the award of a\nresearch grant to support this work.\n1M.
