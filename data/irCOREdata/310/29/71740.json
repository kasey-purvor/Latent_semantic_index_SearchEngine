Data were acquired using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and an Airborne Laser Terrain Mapping (ALTM) 1020 instrument in midsummer for study sites in the New Forest, England, along with concomitant in situ measurements of canopy properties. The stands used displayed a wide variation in the biophysical and biochemical properties of interest. When employing the imaging spectrometer data alone, there were no relationships between any spectral variables (band reflectance, band ratios, or first derivatives of reflectance) and canopy biophysical and biochemical properties when both broad-leaved and coniferous stands were analysed as a combined data set. However, for the broad-leaved stands alone, curvilinear relationships were found between the wavelength position of the red edge (kRE) and pigment concentrations per unit ground area (e.g., R2=0.88** for chlorophyll a [Chl a]) and per unit leaf mass (e.g., R2=0.76** for Chl a). The predictive value of these models was somewhat limited; for example, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 300 mg m-2 (27% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit ground area and 1.17 mg g-1 (24% of the mean) for Chl a concentration per unit leaf mass. A ratio of a near-infrared and a green band (865 nm\/553 nm) was linearly related to leaf area index (LAI) of the broad-leaved stands (R2=0.71**) and the regression model was a reasonable predictor of the LAI for the independent test sites (RMSE=0.88; 18.6% of the mean). Canopy height information derived from the ALTM data was used to mask out canopy gap areas from the CASI imagery of each stand. This process had limited impact on the relationships between spectral and canopy variables for the broad-leaved stands, and kRE remained unrelated to pigment concentrations per unit ground area for the coniferous stands.
