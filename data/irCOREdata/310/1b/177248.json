Information \nis required about what interventions are effective in reducing obesity and influencing \nhealth outcomes in this age group. \nDesign \u2013 Systematic review and meta-analysis \nData sources \u2013 Thirteen databases were searched, earliest date 1966 to December \n2008, including Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, the Cochrane database and EMBASE.   \nStudy selection \u2013 We included studies with participants\u2019 mean age \u2265 60y, mean body \nmass index \u2265 30 kg\/m 2\nData extraction \u2013 Nine eligible trials were included. Study interventions targeted \ndiet, physical activity and mixed approaches. Populations included patients with \ncoronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis.  \n, with outcomes at a minimum of 1 year. Data were \nindependently extracted by two reviewers and differences resolved by consensus.  \nResults - Meta-analysis (7 studies) demonstrated a modest but significant weight loss \nof 3.0 kg (95% CI 5.1 to 0.9) at 1 year. Total cholesterol (4 studies) did not show a \nsignificant change; -0.36 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.75 to 0.04). There was no significant \nchange in HDL, LDL or triglycerides. In one study recurrence of hypertension or \ncardiovascular events were significantly reduced (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to \n0.85). Six minute walk test did not change significantly in one study. Health related \nquality of life significantly improved in one study but did not improve in a second \nstudy. \n 3 \nConclusions - Although modest weight reductions were observed, there is a lack of \nhigh quality evidence to support the efficacy of weight loss programmes in older \npeople. \n \n 4 \nKey Points: \n\u2022 Obesity levels are rising in the over 60s. \n\u2022 Weight loss interventions in older people has not been well studied. \n\u2022 Weight loss programmes have a modest effect in those aged 60 and over. \n\u2022 There is a dearth of high-quality evidence for obesity interventions in this age \ngroup. \n\u2022 Further trial evidence about effects of intentional weight loss is needed, \nparticularly for older old people, examining effects on markers of vascular risk, \nquality of life, physical function, cardiovascular events and death. \n \n 5 \nIntroduction \n \nObesity is recognised as a major health problem amongst children, younger adults and \nmiddle-aged adults in the developed world and increasingly in rapidly industrialising \ncountries[1]. The prevalence of obesity [body mass index (BMI) \u226530kg\/m 2\n \n] in the US \nis currently between 30 and 35% in both middle aged adults (40-59 years) and in \nolder adults (>60 years)[2]. Obesity in older adults is also increasing rapidly in other \nindustrialised countries; England has seen a rapid increase in the number of older \nadults with obesity \u2013 rising from 16% of women and 15% of men aged 75 and over in \n1994[3] to 27% and 18% respectively in 2006. In younger people, obesity is well \nknown to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, osteoarthritis, type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus and reduced exercise capacity[4]. All of these problems are \nprevalent in older people, and contribute to the high burden of disease and functional \nimpairment. \nCompared to younger people, there appears to have been very little research aimed at \nreducing obesity in older adults. There is evidence that modest degrees of overweight \n(BMI 25-29.9 kg\/m2) are not associated with increased mortality in older people[5]; \nindeed the optimum BMI for older adults is higher than for younger people. However, \na recent meta-analysis of cohort studies found an association between BMI \u226530kg\/m 2 \nand mortality in older people (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.13)[5]. Similar findings are \nevident when using more detailed anthropometric measures to circumvent the \ninaccuracies of BMI measurement in older people; older males with increased waist \ncircumference showed increased mortality after adjustment for mid-arm muscle \ncircumference[6]. The effects of obesity may be reversible even in older people; a \n 6 \nlarge cohort study suggested that perceived intentional weight loss confers a \nsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality in males aged 56-75 years[7].  \n \nLosing weight is difficult, and interventions that work in younger adults cannot be \nassumed to translate successfully into an older population, where low muscle mass \nand consequent physical frailty, osteoporosis, comorbid disease and cultural \ndifferences may increase risk and prevent benefits seen in younger people from \ntranslating into health gains in older people. It is likely that sustained weight loss is \nrequired to produce meaningful changes in health outcomes, particularly for \ncardiovascular disease. We therefore systematically reviewed the evidence for \ninterventions designed to produce sustained weight loss in obese older adults to \ninform current practice. \n \nMethods \n \nWe conducted a systematic review using a prespecified protocol, devised according to \nthe guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. We included randomised controlled \ntrials in which weight loss was a primary aim of the intervention, for which follow-up \ndata at a minimum of one year were available, in which the mean age of groups was \n60 years or greater and the mean baseline BMI was \u226530 kg\/m 2\n \n . We included trials \nwith placebo or no intervention for the control group, and trials comparing active \nintervention groups. No language restrictions were used. We excluded studies in \nwhich weight loss was a coincidental change produced by another type of \nintervention. \n 7 \n \nData sources and search strategy \nWe searched 13 electronic databases, earliest date 1966 until 2001[8], five electronic \ndatabases from 2001 - December 2008 (Medline, CINAHL, Psycinfo, the Cochrane \ndatabase and EMBASE), and handsearched four obesity and geriatrics journals. Full \ndetails of the search strategies have been published previously[6]. We used weight \nloss, weight maintenance and obesity related terms customised to each database.  \n \nOutcomes \nWe sought the following outcomes: weight, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, \nLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), \nblood pressure. We also sought information on deaths, hospitalisations, morbidity, \nquality of life, measures of physical function and exercise capacity, and dropouts. We \ncollected data on age, sex, social class, smoking status, dwelling place, disease state \nand source of trial funding. \n \nData extraction and quality assessment \nData were abstracted by two researchers independently, and discrepancies were \nresolved by consensus. Clarification of data was obtained by correspondence with \ntrialists. Values for standard deviations of change in weight, blood pressure and lipids \nwere imputed if not available from trial reports, based on previously published \nalgorithms[8]. Where BMI was recorded but not weight, we imputed weight based on \nheight data from the NHANES III dataset[9]. Study quality was assessed by two \nreviewers independently, and disagreements resolved by consensus. Allocation \n 8 \nconcealment, description of dropouts, availability of intention to treat analysis, \nblinding and baseline comparability of groups were assessed. \n \nData synthesis and analysis \nMeta-analysis was undertaken where results could be quantitatively combined, using \nRevMan 4.2 software (Cochrane Collaboration). I2\n \n tests for heterogeneity across \nanalyses were performed, and possible sources of heterogeneity were explored. \nRandom effects models were used for all analyses. \nResults \n \nSelection of trials \nReports of 649 potentially eligible studies were retrieved for further scrutiny (Figure \n1). The vast majority were ineligible for inclusion; reasons included mean age of \ngroups <60 years, weight reduction not a primary aim of the study; design other than \nrandomised controlled trial; mean baseline BMI <30 kg\/m2\n \n, and follow-up less than \n12 months.  \nDescription of the interventions \nTable 1 gives details of the nine studies included in the review. With one \nexception[10] the included trials were all carried out in the USA; most studies \ntargeted patients with a specific disease entity (diabetes mellitus, coronary artery \ndisease, osteoarthritis). Studies were a mixture of single centre and multicentre trials, \nwith some interventions conducted in community or primary care settings, and some \nin secondary care settings. All studies examined patients who were living in the \n 9 \ncommunity rather than in institutional settings. Only two of the studies had a mean \nbaseline BMI of >35kg\/m2\n \n [11,12]. One trial[11] targeted black and white adults with \ndiabetes living in medically underserved rural communities. \nAll the trials provided dietary advice, with the exception of the PATH trial, which \nprovided physical activity advice[17,18]. In two trials it was not clear whether this \nwas low fat dietary advice[10,14]. Two trials did not report giving physical activity \nadvice[10,15], and three trials provided facilities for undertaking physical \nactivity[12,13,17,18].  \n \nStudy quality \nThe quality of study design and reporting was variable. All studies reported random \nallocation and some studies specified intention to treat analysis in their protocols, but \ninsufficient detail was given in most published reports to decide whether there was \nadequate allocation concealment. Only 2\/9 studies clearly performed intention to treat \nanalyses; insufficient detail was given in 3\/9. Most studies gave numbers of \nwithdrawals, but only four gave reasons for withdrawal or dropout. Baseline treatment \nand control groups were well balanced in all nine studies. Although it is usually not \npossible to blind patients to the intervention employed in weight loss studies, only one \nstudy clearly reported that the team in charge of patients\u2019 usual care was blinded to \nthe intervention, or that those measuring outcomes were blinded to treatment group.  \n \n \n \n \n 10 \nMeta-analysis results \nWeight \nThe overall weighted mean difference change in weight comparing intervention and \ncontrol groups at 12 months was -3.0 kg (95% CI -5.1 to -0.9, P=.005); results are \ndisplayed in Figure 2. Significant statistical heterogeneity was evident (I2\n \n=89%; \nP<.001). Post hoc grouping of the trials according to the type of intervention appears \nto suggest that trials which provided physical activity advice with dietary advice \nappeared to provide greater weight loss. Omission of the two studies for which weight \nchange was extrapolated from BMI change[15,16] gave a change in weight of -3.3 kg \n(95% CI -5.8 to -0.8, P=.009). \nPost hoc subgroup analysis was also performed grouping studies into those with a \ndefined weight loss or calorie restriction and those without such a goal. Studies with a \nclearly defined weight loss goal[10-12,14] showed a change in weight of -4.0 kg \n(95% CI -7.3 to -0.7), compared with -1.3 kg (95% CI -2.9 to 0.3, P<.001 for \ndifference) in those without a defined goal[15-17]. \n \nData from the ADAPT study were not incorporated into the meta-analysis, as data \nwere collected at 18 months from randomisation. This study showed a 12.8 kg fall in \nmean weight in the intervention group, compared with a 2.3 kg fall in the control \ngroup. (difference -10.5 kg, 95% CI -16.4 to -4.6). Toobert[16] reported weight \nchange at 24 months, with a reduction of 2.8 kg (95% CI -7.8 to 2.2) compared with \nthe control group; somewhat smaller than the 5.4 kg difference seen at 12 months. \nTONE[14] reported weight outcomes at 18, 24 and 30 months, showing a reduction \ncompared with the control group of -4.6 kg (95% CI -5.6 to -3.6) at 18 months, -4.5 \n 11 \nkg (95% CI -5.6 to -3.4) at 24 months, and -4.9kg (-6.5 to -3.4) at 30 months. Results \nfrom the DPP study[19] \n \nwere also not incorporated into the meta-analysis as the \nanalysis was performed over 3.2 years rather than at a discrete timepoint; the weight-\nloss intervention group lost a mean of 6.4 kg over the study, compared to a 0.2 kg \nreduction in the placebo arm (P<.001) \nLipids \nData on change in total cholesterol at 12 months were available from four studies \n[10,15,16,18]; the overall weighted mean difference comparing intervention and \ncontrol groups at one year was -0.36 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.75 to 0.04, P=.08). Results \nare shown in Figure 3. Again, significant heterogeneity was detected (I2=77%, \nP=.004). Omitting one study[16] with an anomalous change in cholesterol in the \ncontrol group at 12 months (data checked with author) gave an overall difference in \nchange of -0.18 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.44 to 0.08, P=.17) with lower heterogeneity \n(I2\n \n=52%, p=0.13). This study also provided follow up data at 24 months; total \ncholesterol had risen by 0.31 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.54 to 1.16) relative to the control \ngroup at this timepoint. \nData on weighted mean difference changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol and \ntriglycerides at 12 months were available from two studies[16,18]. The difference in \nchange in LDL cholesterol between intervention and control groups was -0.04 \nmmol\/L (95% CI -0.25 to 0.18, P=.74, I2=0%), the difference in HDL cholesterol was \n0.04 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.04 to 0.12, P=.37, I2=0%), and for triglycerides was 0.44 \nmmol\/L (95% CI -0.55 to 1.43, P=.39, I2\n \n =83%) \n 12 \nBlood pressure \nBlood pressure data were available from the TONE[14] study and one other smaller \nstudy[16]. In TONE, blood pressure medication withdrawal started 90 days after \ncommencing the intervention. At this point, the weight loss group showed a reduction \nof 4.0\/1.1 mmHg in blood pressure, whereas the usual care group showed a reduction \nof 0.8\/0.8 mmHg (reported P<.001 for difference in systolic BP change), and \nantihypertensives could be stopped successfully in 87% of the usual care group \ncompared with 93% of the weight loss group. Data for blood pressure one year or \nmore after randomisation were not presented, but follow-up in TONE for recurrence \nof hypertension or cardiovascular events continued for a median period of 29 \nmonths[14]. In the other study[16], there were no significant differences in either \nsystolic or diastolic blood pressure between intervention and control groups at 12 \nmonths or 24 months. \n \nExercise capacity \nOne study (ADAPT)[13] reported changes in six-minute walk distance at 18 months \nin patients with osteoarthritis. Distance walked in the control group fell by 4.7m, and \nincreased by 9.7m in the intervention group; a statistically and clinically non-\nsignificant difference[20]. In postmenopausal women[17], an exercise-based \nprogramme increased maximal oxygen uptake by 11.7% in the intervention group \ncompared with 0.7% in the control group at 12 months (reported P<.001) \n \nGlycaemic control \nOne study contained data on change in HbA1c at 12 months in patients with \ndiabetes[15]. There was no difference in change between groups (mean HbA1c fell \n 13 \nfrom 7.9% to 7.8% in both groups, reported P=.42). The incidence of new onset \ndiabetes in the DPP study[19] was considerably lower in the intervention group than \nin the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95%CI 0.29 to 0.89)  \n \nMortality, morbidity and hospitalisation \nMortality and hospitalisations were not reported for any studies except TONE[14]. In \nthe TONE study the reported hazard ratio for the primary end point (recurrence of \nhypertension or cardiovascular events) was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.85) for those \nrandomised to weight loss alone compared with controls. One trial[16] reported a \nsignificant improvement in chest pain frequency, but not duration or severity in the \nintervention group over two years. \n \nQuality of life \nTwo studies reported effects on the SF-36 quality of life measure. In one study[21], \noverall health-related quality of life improved by 3.6 points in the intervention group \nbut worsened by 0.8 points in the control group at 12 months (reported P=.02). In the \nother[22], physical health scores improved by 0.8 points in the control group and 3.0 \npoints in the diet group; corresponding values for mental health scores were 0.8 and \n1.2 points respectively. None of these latter changes were reported as reaching \nstatistical significance. \n \nEconomic outcomes \nOne trial of dietary advice estimated costs at US$137\/participant[15]. \n \n \n 14 \nDiscussion \n \nKey findings \nOur systematic review shows a modest but significant reduction in weight with weight \nloss interventions in older, obese people. No clinically significant improvement was \nseen in cholesterol levels, and data were insufficient to draw conclusions regarding \nthe effect of weight loss interventions on other cardiovascular risk factors, exercise \ncapacity, or quality of life. Results for weight loss and change in cholesterol showed \nsignificant heterogeneity, which may have related to whether physical activity was \nincluded in the intervention. Studies with explicit goals for weight reduction or calorie \nrestriction produced greater weight loss than those without explicit goals. \n \nTwo previous systematic reviews have been published examining weight reduction \ninterventions in older people. In one, short-term interventions of six to twelve months \nwere also included[23], but studies showing a reduction in weight of <2 kg were \nexcluded, potentially biasing the results. This review concluded that clinically \nimportant benefits may be achievable in patients with diabetes, osteoarthritis and \ncoronary artery disease. The second review[24] had similar inclusion criteria to the \ncurrent review, but included fewer studies, and did not attempt to meta-analyse the \nresults. A similar spread of weight reductions was noted compared with the current \nreview. \n \nStrengths and weaknesses \nAlthough we believe that our search strategy has included all eligible papers, it is \npossible that unpublished studies exist that have not been included. Handsearching of \n 15 \nrecent abstracts did not reveal any further studies however. The participants enrolled \nin the included studies did not appear to have a high burden of comorbid disease in \ncomparison to many older people; baseline data regarding physical and psychosocial \nfunction were however lacking. Inadequate reporting and heterogenous outcome times \nand measures hampered our ability to combine data into meta-analysis; the results \nshould therefore be treated with caution. Although anthropometric measures of \nadiposity may provide a more sensitive measure of response to interventions, these \ndata were not available for most of the included studies. \n \nStudy findings in context \nA variety of weight reduction approaches have been shown to be effective in younger \npatients, with a mean reduction of 5kg in weight at 12 months for low-fat diets[8]. In \nyounger patients, epidemiological modelling suggests that intentional weight loss is \nassociated with up to a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality in women[8]; this result \nwas not seen in men with intentional weight loss. Concern exists that obesity may be \nprotective against death in some diseases that are very common in older people, \nincluding coronary artery disease and heart failure \u2013 the so-called \u2018obesity \nparadox\u2019[23]. Our analysis is unable to shed further light on this issue; only the \nTONE study reported deaths and cardiovascular events, and numbers were too small \nto draw conclusions on death rates from this single study. Furthermore, it is probably \nunreasonable to expect to detect changes in markers of cardiovascular disease, \nexercise capacity and quality of life without first achieving a significant, sustained \nreduction in weight. \n \n 16 \nThe paucity of trials conducted in older people is striking; indeed even those studies \nthat we included had a mean age between 60 and 69 years. There is therefore virtually \nno evidence to guide practice in people older than this. Equally striking is the paucity \nof outcome data that addresses issues directly relevant to older people \u2013 exercise \ncapacity, physical function and quality of life. Such data are essential if the overall \nimpact of interventions on health status is to be determined, as opposed to a narrow \neffect on risk factors for disease. No studies of pharmacological interventions for \nweight loss in older people were found for inclusion in this review; results from the \nlarge SCOUT trial of sibutramine in high cardiovascular risk people should provide \nadditional data in this area, although very few patients aged over 75 years were \nrandomised[24].  \n \nFuture directions \nTrials of weight loss interventions in older people are badly needed. Such trials should \nincorporate approaches to behavioural modification grounded in psychological theory \nand tailored to older people, and need to take account of multiple comorbidities in \nolder people. Trials will need to include much older people than previously, and \nshould actively seek to include patients with extensive comorbidities. Baseline details \nneed to include information on cognition, deprivation, physical function, social \nsupport and comorbid disease. Although weight, cardiovascular risk factors, and \nclinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events should be measured, patient-centred \noutcomes will also be needed[25]. Such an approach is necessary to ensure not only \nthat the evidence base is relevant to typical older people with obesity, but that it can \nbe seen to be relevant \u2013 by patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. \n \n 17 \nAcknowledgements \nWith thanks to Dr Deborah Toobert and Dr Dennis Villareal for providing additional \ndata. \n 18 \nReferences \n \n1.
