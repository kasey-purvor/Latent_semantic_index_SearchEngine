In this letter, we report the dependence of the coeffi-\ncient of thermal expansion, Young\u2019s modulus, and the Pois-\nson\u2019s ratio of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) as a\nfunction of the sp2 concentration.\nFilms with different sp2 concentrations were deposited\nat the cathode electrode of a glow discharge system by vary-\ning the bias voltage from 2100 to 21200 V under conditions\nof room temperature and constant methane (CH4) gas pres-\nsure of 1.0 Pa. The concentrations of the sp2 bonds were\ndetermined by electron energy-loss spectroscopy ~EELS!\nperformed on a 100 kV VG scanning transmission electron\nmicroscope ~STEM!, fitted with a McMullan parallel EELS\ndetection system. The sp2 concentration was determined\nfrom the size of the p* peak in the carbon K edge ~the\n1s \u2013 2p transition! which is normalized to the graphite\nequivalent.6,7 The hardness was obtained using a Berkovich\ndiamond tip ~NanoTest-100! at a depth of about 20% of the\nfilm deposited on silicon substrate, and the results were ana-\nlyzed using the Oliver and Pharr method.8\nEquation ~1! describes the thermal dependence of the\nstress (Ds th) due to mismatch in the CTE of the film (a f)\nand that of the substrate (as):9\nDs th5E f \/~12n f !~as2a f !DT , ~1!\nwhere E and n are the Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio,\nrespectively, and DT is the temperature interval.

The\nthree unknown parameters in Eq. ~1! can be reduced to two\nby defining the biaxial modulus as E f \/(12n f); the coeffi-\ncient of thermal expansion and the biaxial modulus can then\nbe determined from the measured temperature dependence of\nthe stress for the same film deposited onto at least two dif-\nferent substrates.11 The slope Ds\/DT was measured during\nthe cooling cycle, from 120 \u00b0C to room temperature, at a rate\nof about 1 \u00b0C\/min.

The solid curve represents a linear fit whose slope\nis the biaxial modulus, E f \/(12n f), and whose intercept\nwith the as axis is the CTE of the film,5 according to Eq. ~1!.\nThe above procedure was used to determine the CTE of\na-C:H films as a function of the sp2-bond concentration\n~Fig. 1!. The CTE increases with the amount of sp2-bonded\ncarbon from 231026 C21 to ;731026 C21, comparable\nto the average CTE of graphite ~see Table I!. Demichelis\net al.3 determined the behavior of the thermal expansion of\na-C films, and observed a qualitative reduction in the CTE\nas the percentage of sp3 bonds increases, but their data was\nobtained only at low temperature ~10\u2013200 K!. Using a pho-\ntothermal reflection technique, Lee et al.1 determined the\nCTE of a-C:H as a function of the hydrogen concentration\nand found out that it increases slightly, from 2.02\u2013 2.41\n31026 K21, as the hydrogen concentration increases from\n15% to 50%. The hydrogen concentration of the samples of\nFig. 1, determined by elastic recoil detection analysis, is in\nthe 0% to 25% range, but the CTE varies from 1.3\n31026 K21 to 7.031026 K21. These two completely dif-\nferent results could be explained if hydrogen has little influ-\nence on CTE. In fact, hydrogen has only one bond and so it\nis a terminal bond that provides the \u2018\u2018catalyst\u2019\u2019 for a void-like\nstructure, which will have little influence on the thermal ex-\npansion properties. On the other hand, sp2 and sp3 bonds\ncontribute to the skeletal structure of the carbon network,\nwhich is ultimately responsible for the thermal expansion.\nTable I shows a summary of data for different forms of\ncarbon structures. The CTE of amorphous carbon is between\nthose of diamond and graphite ~if one adopts an average\u2013\nCTE for graphite!. Chemical vapor deposited diamond ~CVD\ndiamond! has a CTE very close to that of natural diamond.12\nThe CTE of a-C:H approaches that of diamond as the sp3\nconcentration increases, therefore we can also expect that the\nCTEs of ta-C and ta-C:H to be close to that of diamond.\nThe increase of the CTE of a-C:H with increasing con-\ncentration of sp2 sites indicates that clusters of piled aro-\nmatic layers are being formed. This assumption is supported\nby the anisotropic characteristics of the CTE in graphite,\nwhich is very high (2731026 C21) in the direction perpen-\ndicular to the basal planes of aromatic rings, but negative in\nplane ~see Table I!. Basal planes are bonded by van der\nWaals forces, resulting in high thermal expansion coeffi-\ncients, as for the majority of metals, whilst the in-plane\nbonding is due to the strong s bonds. On the other hand, the\nCTE is negative in plane, which is characteristic of strong s\nTABLE I.

This interpretation is also supported by Raman scat-\ntering, Fig. 2, where the shift on the G band indicates an\nincrease in the formation of clusters with the increase of the\nsp2 content. Also, the relation ID \/IG versus band gap ~see,\ninset in Fig. 2! has been used to point towards an increase of\nthe cluster size.15 Thus, if a-C:H films are prepared with a\nhigh concentration of randomly dispersed sp2 sites or an-\nother structure with small concentration of clusters of aro-\nmatic planes, we would expect a small thermal expansion\ncoefficient. This may explain the results obtained by Lee\net al.1\nThe elastic constants n and E usually appear mixed in\nmost equations, making it difficult to determine each one\nseparately. Using the thermally induced bending ~TIB! tech-\nnique, for instance, one obtains the E\/(12n) ratio,11 while\nnanohardness measurements give the E\/(12n2) ratio ~using\nthe Oliver and Pharr model!.8 However, one can extract E\nand n if both measurements are performed on the same\nsample. In Fig. 3 we show the use of this approach. Figure\n3~a! displays both elastic modulus, and Figs. 3~b! and 3~c!\ndisplay E and n, respectively, as derived from the data of Fig.\n3~a!. The Young\u2019s modulus decreases as the sp2 concentra-\ntion increases. This behavior is little influenced by Poisson\u2019s\nratio, since it remains constant, within experimental error,\nand of the order of 0.3 in the range of sp2 concentrations\ninvestigated. A different approach has been used by Jiang\net al. to extract both E and n16 of a-C films, using a combi-\nnation of Brillouin scattering and nanohardness measure-\nments. Their data for the Poisson\u2019s ratio is also displayed in\nFig. 3~c!, and is comparable to the results obtained in the\npresent work. Similar results have also been found for a\nta-C:H film @with a higher Young\u2019s modulus ~;300 GPa!\nFIG. 2.
