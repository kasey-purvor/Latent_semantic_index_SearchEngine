This is a standard approach that invokes a condition of \nuniaxial strain in both the target and the flyer plate leading to the formation of a shock \nwave in both. Typically the fluid is contained in a capsule that is usually destroyed on \nimpact, during which the particle velocity is measured either by using a VISAR \n(Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector) system or inferred from the time-\nof-arrival of the shock measured by two spatially separated gauges, the Hugoniot \nproperties of the flyer plate and its impact velocity.  \nThe behaviour of bacterial broths that have been subjected to shock loading \nhas also been the subject of a number of studies. Usually, this is achieved either by \nelectrohydraulic action where an electrodischarge generates a shock wave in a \nsuspension e.g., [1] or by using an explosive charge [2,3] where pressures of several \nhundreds of MPa are expected. Some studies have also focussed on high velocity \nplate impact studies where gas-driven or explosively-driven flyer plates are \naccelerated to high velocities. The impact of these flyer plates has resulted in high \nshock pressures (many GPa scale) being generated in spore-loaded minerals such as \ngabbro [4]. Other researchers have used high pressure shock tubes for dynamically \nloading the biological sample [5] whereas other experiments have centred around \nhypervelocity impacts where spherical projectiles are accelerated to hypervelocity \n(c.a. 2-5 km\/s) which results in large shock pressures (many GPa scale) being \ntemporarily sustained by the organisms in question [6].  \nThe behaviour of bacterial spores being subjected to shock wave loading is \nimportant, not least as it could provide an alternative route to pasteurisation. Loske et \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 3\nal. [7] subjected E. coli in suspension to hundreds of shock waves using an \nelectrohydraulic shock wave generator. Using a parabolic reflector, they showed it \nwas possible to produce a plane shock front and expose many samples to shock at the \nsame time. Experimental results indicated that electrohydraulically generated shock \nwaves are capable of producing a significant reduction in an E. coli population with \naverage shock magnitudes of 44 MPa. However, the authors also pointed out that their \nsystem generated UV light that could have contributed to the kill mechanism. \nFurthermore, a negative pressure pulse of 6 MPa was also measured which ultimately \nwould have caused cavitation, again possibly contributing to the kill mechanism. \nZuckerman et al. [8] generated pressures ranging from 80 to 100 MPa using a \npiezoelectric probe. They showed that up to 7.5 log reduction was observed for E. coli \nafter the application of five pulses. Furthermore, a 4-5 log reduction of Lactic acid \nand Staphlococcus aureus was also seen when subjected to identical loading \nconditions to the E. coli. Again, it was thought that UV radiation may have played a \npart in the lethal effects. \nThere is evidence that certain types of bacteria are made inactive when \nsubjected to certain pressure regimes. Abe et al. [9] loaded a bacterial broth housed in \nan aluminium capsule such that pressures of 200 MPa resulted in the inactivation of \nmarine Vibrio sp that had been isolated from sea water. Electron microscope and \nprotein analysis showed that the shock waves did not kill the bacteria; instead the \nbacteria were deformed by the process.  Whereas, shock pressures generated by shock \nwave lithotripsy in a vat of water containing E. coli  and Listeria monocytogenes \nresulted in no inactivation with up to 8000 single shock waves of magnitude 38 MPa \n[10]. Nevertheless there was a reduction in activity when multiple dual shock waves \nwere used. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 4\nThere is however, some evidence that yeast has increased mortality under high \nshock pressure. Kani [11] used a powder gun to accelerate copper flyer discs at a \nstainless steel capsule containing yeast. In this work the author showed that applying a \nshock pressure of c.a. 1 GPa, provided by an impact velocity of 450 m\/s, the vital \nforce became weak (assessed by the reduction in cultivated colonies after shock \nloading); it was suggested that it may even disappear altogether with an increase in \napplied pressure. \nThere is some evidence that certain bacteria survive very high shock pressures. \nFor example, Burchell et al. [12] has shown that when transient shock pressures are \nformed from hypervelocity impacts of spherical projectiles into targets, Rhodococcus \nerythropolis cells survive. The authors noted that although survival rates were low at a \nshock pressure of 78 GPa, they were still finite. Their results indicated that survival \nfell with a log law as the shock pressure increased. They also noted that for a different \norganism, Bacillis subtilis, the survival rate at 78 GPa was found to be higher than \nthat of the Rhodococcus erythropolis indicating that survival rate may well depend on \nthe type of bacteria. St\u00f6ffler et al. [4] has also shown high survival rates of bacterial \nspores (Bacillus subtilis), cyanobacteria (Chroococcidiopsis sp.), and lichen \n(Xanthoria elegans) embedded in gabbro when subjected to high shock stresses (>10 \nGPa). Willis et al. [13] also reported limited mortality rates for Escherichia coli \nshocked to an initial shock pressure of 0.26 GPa using the flyer-plate technique. \nUnlike most other previous work, they were able to shock their bacteria in suspension \nto high pressures. However, they were only able to recover one of the four samples in \nthe original liquid with the other three requiring re-suspension. As the authors point \nout this may have affected the recorded survival rates for 3 of the 4 samples. Where \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 5\ndead bacteria were recovered, they were able to conduct TEM analysis that revealed \ncell wall rupture and delamination. \n Some of these experimental techniques are disadvantaged in that they produce \nsimultaneous cavitation in the medium as well as high shock pressure, they generate \nUV light or they do not allow for sample recovery after the experiment without risk of \ncontamination. Cavitation is also a concern as this is also thought to contribute to the \nkill mechanism of bacteria. In this paper, we report the design of a capsule that can be \nused during 1D uniaxial strain plate impact experiments to shock compress a volume \nof fluid to c.a. 1.2 GPa where cavitation is suppressed by virtue of the dynamic \nloading by a front plate. Additionally, modification to the design of the capsule to \nallow the introduction of controlled levels of cavitation in the sample is discussed.  \nThe capsule was designed to be recoverable so that no contamination would occur \nduring the experiment. ANSYS\u00ae AUTODYN hydrocode simulations are also \npresented that show the ringing up of the shock within the fluid layer as well as the \npressures achieved in dynamic (cover-plate) compression. Results are presented that \nshow that Escherichia coli, Enterococcus feacalis and Zygosaccharomyces bailii  are \nnot affected by high compressive loads where cavitation is suppressed which suggests \nthat the main mechanisms of kill seen by previous researchers using pulsed electrical \ndischarges was not due to the shock pressure. Finally, by testing coarse emulsions \nusing the same technique we will show that it is possible to induce cavitation leading \nto significant emulsification of the sample.  \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 6\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN \n \nBackground to the experiment \n \nPlate impact experiments are commonly used to induce shock waves in target \nmaterials. In the plate impact configuration, targets are struck with flying-plates \ncarefully aligned so that all points on the projectile\u2019s surface make contact with the \ntarget simultaneously. This requires that both the impacting plate and the target are \nflat and parallel to within a tolerance of micrometres. The impact of a flyer-plate \ngenerates a planar shock wave in the target. In this situation, all strain is \naccommodated along the impact axis while the orthogonal components of strain are \nzero due to inertial confinement. Consequently, the orthogonal components of stress \nare non-zero. Therefore in summary, the conditions of stress and strain in the target \nare: \n \n0==\u2260 zyx \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5  and 0\u2260=\u2260 zyx \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 ,      \n \nwhere subscript x is denotes the condition along the impact axis and subscripts y and z \ndenote the conditions orthogonal to the impact axis.  \n \nCapsule design \n \nThe capsule was manufactured from AISI 304 L by RTS (Leeds) Ltd. The \nmanufacturer\u2019s data sheet stated a UTS value of 591 MPa and an elongation to failure \nof 55%.

The purpose of one of the experiments was to \nload the bacterial broths in compression to high pressures whilst at the same time \nsuppressing cavitation in the fluid layer. To that end, ductile steel was chosen. \nFurthermore, this particular brand of stainless steel is commonly used within the food \nindustry and the shock behaviour of this stainless steel is relatively well understood \n[14-17]. \n \nTable 1: Elastic properties of the AISI 304 L material used to manufacture the \ncapsule. \nMaterial \u03c10 (g\/cc) cL (mm\/\u00b5s) cS (mm\/\u00b5s) G (GPa) \u03bd \nAISI 304L 7.903 5.739 3.155 78.5 0.283 \n \nThe capsule design is as shown in Figure 1. A 10-mm thick 304 L cover plate \nwas bolted to the cup using ten M6 bolts on a 76 mm pitch-circle diameter; the \ndiameter of the capsule was 88 mm. The test specimens were instrumented with a \nsingle manganin pressure gauge manufactured by Vishay (LM-SS-125CH-048) which \nwas encapsulated by two 25\u03bcm Mylar layers. A copper front plate (5 mm) was used \nto protect the gauge. Calibration of this gauge was according to the method of \nRosenberg et al.

In \na second set of experiments, a hollow steel cylindrical insert of length 3 mm was \nplaced in the 46-mm diameter cavity. The wall thickness of this insert was 1 mm. The \npurpose of the steel insert was to provide support for a 15 \u00b5m Mylar barrier that was \nglued to the top surface of the insert. This barrier would provide separation between \nthe liquid sample and an air pocket trapped beneath the Mylar thereby causing \ncavitation in the fluid. A similar 13-mm long hollow cylinder was glued on top of the \n3-mm long cylinder to sandwich the Mylar and to ensure sealing. \n \nExperiments \n \nAll the experiments were conducted using a 50-mm single-stage light gas gun \n[19].  10-mm thick copper flyer plates were accelerated to velocities of between 345 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 9\nm\/s and 450 m\/s and were used to dynamically load each capsule containing the fluid \nof interest.  The velocities of the projectile were measured by using a sequential pin \nshorting system to an accuracy of 0.5%. A fast digital storage oscilloscopes (2 GS\/s) \nwas used to capture the arrival and shape of the shock; subsequent data reduction and \nanalysis was done on a PC. Two different types of microorganism-loaded fluids and \nan emulsion were tested. \n \nTest specimens \n \nThe microorganisms used for this experiment were Zygosaccharomyces bailii \nDSM 70492 and a cocktail of Escherichia coli NCTC 9001 and Enterococcus \nfaecalis, culture ATCC 19433. Zygosaccharomyces bailii is a common spoilage yeast \nin the food industry chiefly affecting fruit juices; Escherichia coli and Enterococcus \nfaecalis are relatively harmless members of the normal gut flora. \nThe Z. bailii experimental culture was prepared by incubating in malt extract \nbroth (prepared from Oxoid powder) at 25\u00b0C for 3 days to provide a 108 colony \nforming units\/ml (cfu\/ml). A cocktail of E. coli and E. faecalis was incubated in \nnutrient broth (prepared from Oxoid powder) at 37\u00b0C for 1 day to achieve the 108 \ncfu\/ml. These cultures were then individually subjected to shock loading. \nAfter subjecting the capsules to the shockwave the capsules were recovered \nand opened using aseptic techniques. A 1 ml sample was withdrawn and serially \ndiluted into 8 by 9 ml of half-strength ringer\u2019s solution. 0.1 ml of each of the dilutions \nwas then plated onto nutrient agar for incubation and subsequent numerical \nevaluation.  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 10\nThe formation of fine emulsions is an important part of food-processing \nindustry and consequently two separate trials were carried out to evaluate the role of \nshock-wave application in preparation of emulsions.

Firstly, it can be seen from \nboth experiments that the shock is characterised by a very fast rise time (c. 100 ns) \nresulting in ringing in the gauge. This ringing is electrical in nature and is commonly \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 16\nreported for these types of gauges embedded between metallic plates [31]. Secondly, \nit should be pointed out that the rise time observed in the models was relatively slow \ncompared to experiments. This is to be expected and is due to the shock wave being \nsmeared across the cells. The gauge is seen to fail in both experiments at roughly the \nsame time and is probably due to the extensive plastic deformation observed in the \ncopper cover plate coupled with the arrival of the release wave. \n \nPressure history in the fluid layer \n \nFrom 1D hydrodynamic calculations using the Rankine-Hugoniot \nrelationships, the magnitude of the shock in the fluid layer was calculated as initially \nbeing 0.64 GPa and 0.87 GPa for the experiments with an impact velocity of 345 m\/s \nand 446 m\/s respectively. However, 2D simulations using ANSYS\u00ae AUTODYN \nshowed that the shock was higher than this in the fluid layer due to ringing. Figure 4 \nshows the pressure history in a capsule that has been struck by a copper flyer plate at \n446 m\/s. At 0 \u03bcs (a reference time corresponding to 8 \u03bcs after impact), a shock of \nmagnitude 0.8 GPa is seen to propagate in the fluid layer. Eventually this shock wave \nreaches the fluid \/ steel boundary; 5 \u03bcs later it is seen to have been reflected. The \nreflection resulted in a pressure increase as the shock wave travels back towards the \nimpact interface. Eventually, the shock wave encounters the stainless steel cover plate \nthat is deforming due to it being pressed into the cavity. Consequently, on contact \nwith the stainless steel cover plate, the shock in the fluid layer undergoes a shape \nchange from a reasonably flat wave to that of a divergent wave. In essence, the shock \nwave rang up in the fluid layer before dissipating to a steady state. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 17\n The suppression of the cavitation that would have otherwise occurred was due \nto the thickness of the flyer plate and by virtue of the deformation of the cover plate \nattached to the main cup of the capsule assembly. Figure 5 shows the deformation of \nthe cover from the experiment and the simulation; in both cases the impact velocity of \nthe flyer plate was 446 m\/s. Firstly it can be seen that the distinct similarity of the \nfinal profile gives confidence in the Johnson-Cook model for the stainless steel that \nwas taken from [26]. Secondly, it is evident that the ductility of the steel used here \nwas advantageous in allowing the plastic flow into the cavity. Consequently, the \nchoice of a ductile steel that is able to flow, over and above a relatively strong steel \nthat would have provided little ductility is desirable. \nShock wave in the fluid layer (0 \u03bcs) +5 \u03bcs\n+15 \u03bcs+10 \u03bcs  \nFigure 4: ANSYS\u00ae AUTODYN simulation of the experiment without the air cavity; \nvelocity of impact = 446 m\/s. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 18\nExperiment\nSimulation  \n \nFigure 5: Deformation of the cover plate showing the results from an impact at 446 \nm\/s for both the experiment (top) and the simulation (bottom). \n \n \nShock wave in the fluid layer (0 \u03bcs) +5 \u03bcs negative phase\n+15 \u03bcs+10 \u03bcs\nAir cavity\n \nFigure 6: ANSYS\u00ae AUTODYN simulation of the experiment with the air cavity; \nvelocity of impact = 446 m\/s.  \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 19\nIntroducing a cavity behind the fluid layer resulted in a different response as \nshown in Figure 6.  The simulation has been done using the same impact velocity as \nthe case presented in Figure 4 for comparison. Again, the shock is seen to traverse the \nfluid layer however 5 \u03bcs later, due to the presence of the cavity, a negative pressure \nphase occurs as the release wave propagates from the membrane barrier towards the \ndirection of the impact face. This resulted in a condition where the fluid layer is \nessentially \u201cstretched\u201d [32]. A second shock occurs as the fluid contacts the base of \nthe cavity and propagates back towards the impact face. Eventually, the shock again \nrings up within the fluid layer before reaching a steady state. By 15 \u03bcs, erosion of the \nlagrangian cells within the encapsulated fluid is evident. \nThe loading regime for these experiments is considerably different to the first \nset of experiments and consequently subjected the fluid to a negative pressure thereby \ninvoking cavitation followed by reloading.  \nThe numerical calculations of the pressure history in the suspension for both \ntypes of experiments (velocity of impact = 446 m\/s) are presented in Figures 7 and 8. \nIn each case, the pressure history over 40 \u03bcs is presented for two gauge tracer points \nlocated in a line at 10.00 mm from the axis of symmetry and placed at 0.25 mm and \n10.25 mm from the interface between the stainless steel cover plate and the \nsuspension. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nTime (\u03bcs)\nP\nre\nss\nur\ne \n(G\nP\na)\nGauge 1; 0.25 mm\nGauge 2; 10.25 mm\nReflection \n \nFigure 7: Pressure history calculations from the simulation without the air cavity; \nvelocity of impact = 446 m\/s. \n \nFor the pressure-history trace of the experiment without the air gap (Figure 7), \nthe initial shock in the suspension is seen at 3 \u03bcs from the point of time of impact by \nthe copper flyer-plate.  The shock state is seen to release at this gauge location before \nreload occurs at c.a. 16 \u03bcs due to the reflection of the shock wave from the stainless \nsteel rear boundary.

The second reload was caused by the \nimpact of the suspension against the rear stainless steel surface (see Figure 6).  \n \nEffect of the compression on the fluid layers \n  \nAnalysis of the shocked specimens showed that the compression pulse had \nlittle effect on the bacterial samples when cavitation was suppressed; no reduction in \nnumbers was observed when compared to the control (unshocked) specimen. This is \nsomewhat surprising given the high compression that was achieved using this \ntechnique and given that other researchers have noted bacterial kill with much lower \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 22\npressures [7,8]. This confirms that the mechanisms of kill were not dependent on the \nmagnitude of the pressure but rather the degree of repetition and, perhaps, exposure to \nUV light. It should be pointed out that the materials in the structure of the cells do \nhave very similar shock properties to the medium in which they are suspended. \nNevertheless, it is known that the cell walls of microorganisms such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae [33] do possess small but finite stiffness values. \nConsequently, it is envisaged that very high single shock pressures are required to \ncause delamination of the cell structure. Willis et al. [13] did see mortality in their \nspecimens that were shocked in a fluid medium to higher shock states observed here. \nOne suggested explanation the observed mortality was put down to the shock\u2013induced \nphase transformation during near-isentropic compression of the suspension leading to \nthe formation of ice VI or ice VII. These high pressure phases are 20 % to 25 % \ndenser than the liquid and consequently would lead to over pressures in the liquid \ncytoplasm. An alternative explanation was also provided by Willis et al. for the \nobserved cell mortality.  The density variations in the cell\u2019s makeup may give rise to \nRichtmyer-Meshkov fluid instabilities induced by the shock acceleration of the \ninterfaces between each cell layer. However, this latter explanation appears less likely \ngiven the shock pressures achieved in our experiments and the observed survivability. \nHowever, when the air-gap was introduced in the cavity limited kill was \nobserved with 1-log reduction in the yeast sample only. Given the violence associated \nwith cavitation, it is perhaps surprising that these microorganisms demonstrate \nsignificant survivability. These results confirm the hardy nature of micro-organisms \nthat have been subjected to shock loading as noted by Burchell et al. [6, 12]. \n Perhaps more enlightening are the effects that the shock wave had on the \nemulsification of the oil-based solutions. Figure 9 shows the effect on the sample \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 23\nwhen the sample has been subjected to shock compression and where cavitation had \nbeen suppressed (with no air gap). The coarse emulsions prior to the passage of the \nshock wave possessed a volume mean particle size of 13.6 \u00b5m with a distribution (by \n% volume) of particle sizes as follows: 10% \u2264 1.2 \u03bcm, 50% \u2264 13.0 \u03bcm and 90% \u2264 \n25.1 \u03bcm. After the passage of the shockwave, the droplet size distribution changed, \nproducing smaller droplets with a volume mean particle size of 8.2 \u03bcm and a \ndistribution of: 10% \u2264 1.2\u03bcm, 50% \u2264 7.3 \u03bcm and 90% \u2264 16.7\u03bcm. \n For the second experimental setup where cavitation was expected, significant \nemulsification occurred as shown in Figure 10. After the passage of the shockwave, \nthe droplet size distribution changed, producing smaller droplets with a volume mean \nparticle size of 7.8 \u00b5m and a distribution as follows: 10% \u2264 0.7 \u03bcm, 50% \u2264 2.6 \u03bcm \nand 90% \u2264 16.5 \u03bcm. These results demonstrate a shift in population from 10-20 \nmicrometres to 1-10 micrometres (see Figure 11) that remained stable when tested 7 \ndays later. We should point out however that this occurred at a higher impact velocity \n(441 m\/s as opposed to 345 m\/s). Nevertheless, it is probable that the increased impact \nvelocity should have little effect on the degree of cavitation as this is solely governed \nby wave reflections. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no work has been done to examine \nhigh pressure shock wave interaction with emulsions, although ultrasonic approaches \nhave been extensively studied [34-37]. Current thinking suggest that emulsification by \nultrasound at least is governed by a localised cavitation zone [38]. These results are \nconsistent with our shock studies and confirm that the capsule is behaving as expected \nfrom the modelling results. However, as noted above, a certain degree of \nemulsification has occurred in Figure 9. Consequently, as we are suppressing \ncavitation in this experimental setup, a different mechanism of break up must be at \nplay and this demands explanation. One possibility is that the divergent wave front \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 24\nreflected from the deforming cover plate (see Figure 4) is inducing shear in the oil \ndroplets. This may well be expected to cause a breakdown of the particle however we \nare unable to verify this using the current setup. \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n0.\n01 0.\n1 1 10 10\n0\n10\n00\nParticle size (\u03bcm)\nV\nol\num\ne \n(%\n)\nPre-shock\nPost-shock\n \nFigure 9: Pre and post shock particle distribution (no air gap at the rear); velocity of \nimpact = 345 m\/s. \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n0.\n01 0.\n1 1 10 10\n0\n10\n00\nParticle size (\u03bcm)\nV\nol\num\ne \n(%\n)\nPre-shock\nPost-shock\nPost shock\n+7 days\n \n \nFigure 10:  Pre and post shock particle distribution (with an air gap at the rear); \nvelocity of impact = 441 m\/s. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 25\n \n  \n10 \u03bcm\n(a) (b)\n \n \nFigure 11: Light micrographs of (a) Emulsion before treatment and (b) emulsion after \nthe passage of the shock wave (with air gap). \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nDifferent bacterial solutions have been subjected to shock loading where the \nmagnitude of the shock wave in the suspension approached c.a. 1.2 GPa. It was found \nthat using a ductile cover plate for the capsule resulted in suppression of cavitation in \nthe fluid layer by virtue of extrusion of the plate into the cavity. The capsules were \nrecovered intact so that post experimental analysis could be done on the contents. \nFurthermore, we have also shown that microorganisms such as Zygosaccharomyces \nbailii, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis are not affected by this type of \nloading regime. However, a limited amount of emulsification of a simple oil water \nmixture did occur and it was thought that this was most likely due to the presence of \nthe divergent wave front due to the deforming front plate. \nBy introducing a cavity behind the fluid sample it was possible to encourage \ncavitation and consequently, increase the degree of emulsification that occurred. This \nresulted in the formation of a stable emulsion. It was also noted that the yeast sample \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 26\nsuffered a 1-log reduction in numbers due to the passage of the shock wave and \nresulting violence from cavitation; the bacterial sample was largely unaffected. \nFurther, other researchers have noted significant bacterial kill with much lower \npressures [1,7,8]. This confirms that the mechanisms of kill in the earlier work were \nnot purely dependent on the magnitude of the pressure but rather the degree of \nrepetition and, perhaps, exposure to UV light. \nNumerical simulations of the experiments were conduced using ANSYS\u00ae \nAUTODYN that showed good correlation with the experimental results. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nWe would like to thank Mr Gary Cooper for helping with the design of the capsule \nand supporting the experiments.
