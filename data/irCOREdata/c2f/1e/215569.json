In this\nway, it shows how racial ideas are disseminated, not just in dedicated volumes on\nanatomy and biological classification, but also in general works which purport to\nsummarize and transmit contemporary received knowledge.1 The article draws\nupon entries on \u201cEurope\u201d in every British encyclopedia completed between 1771\nand 1830, as well as named source texts for those articles, tracing how the word\n\u201cEurope\u201d was used and what racial connotations it carried. Some entries imply\nthat \u201cEuropean\u201d is either a separate race entirely, or a subcategory of a single\nhuman race. Others, however, reject the idea of a distinctive European people\nin order to identify competing racial groups in Europe. These complexities\nreveal increasing interest in the delineation of European identities, an interest\nwhich emerges partly from long-standing eighteenth-century debates about the\ncategorization and comprehension of human difference. In addition, they show\nthe diffusion of (contending) racial ideas in non-specialist media, foreshadowing\nthe growing prominence of racial thought in the later nineteenth century.\nthe concept of \u201crace\u201d\nTo talk of \u201crace\u201d in this period is itself complex and controversial, principally\nbecause the term had a number of complex meanings in the eighteenth and early\nnineteenth centuries. According to Nicholas Hudson, it most commonly referred\nto \u201cfamily lines, lineage, extraction . . . or breeds of animal\u201d, and thus had both\ndynastic and classificatory connotations.2 \u201cRaces\u201d\u2014that is, lines of descent or\ngroups of peoples\u2014could be \u201cidentified and signified through religion, custom,\nlanguage, climate aesthetics and historical time, as much as physiognomy and\nskin colour\u201d. For this reason, conceptions of \u201crace\u201d were intertwined with ideas\nabout politics and nation: they \u201coccupied overlapping if not identical cultural\nand political terrains . . . used to distinguish groups by lineage, common descent\nor origin and to identify political, social and territorial particularity\u201d.3 In other\nwords, discussion about \u201crace\u201d encompassed various interrelated understandings\n1 For anthologies of such specialist works from this period see H. F. Augstein, ed., Race: The\nOrigins of an Idea (Bristol, 1996); Emanuel Chudwuki Eze, ed., Race and Enlightenment:\nA Reader (Oxford, 1997); Peter Kitson and Debbie Lee, eds., Slavery, Abolition and\nEmancipation: Writings in the British Romantic Period, vol. 8, Theories of Race, ed. Peter\nKitson (London, 1999)\n2 Nicholas Hudson, \u201cFrom \u2018Nation\u2019 to \u2018Race\u2019: The Origin of Racial Classification in\nEighteenth-Century Thought\u201d, Eighteenth-Century Studies 29\/3 (1996), 247.\n3 Kathleen Wilson, The Island Race: Englishness, Empire and Gender in the Eighteenth Century\n(London and New York, 2003), 11\u201312, 55.\n\u201calmost a separate race\u201d 5\nof human difference: physical appearance, disposition, environmental influences,\ndescent or origins, religion, cultural mannerisms, and political systems. For this\nreason, Roxann Wheeler speaks of the \u201cfluid articulation of human variety\u201d and\nthe \u201celasticity of race\u201d in the eighteenth century. In particular, she warns against\nanachronistic and essentialist understandings of \u201crace\u201d as a set of fixed physical\ncharacteristics.4 The word \u201cethnic\u201d, for instance, originally meant \u201cheathen,\nungodly, irreligious\u201d, which emphasizes the importance of religious belief and\nsocial practice in distinguishing and categorizing different peoples.5\nEighteenth- and early nineteenth-century thinkers were thus preoccupied\nby \u201cthe tenuous . . . opposition between nature and society, the innate and\nthe acquired\u201d, especially the related problems of how supposedly \u201cnatural\u201d\ncharacteristics could change, and how acquired behaviours and qualities could\ncome to seem innate. In this sense, the \u201cpoles of an essentialised Nature\nand a capricious Environment\u201d competed and overlapped with one another:\nideas about manners and society were ambiguously interconnected with\n\u201cabsolutist notions\u201d of inheritance and non-acquired \u201cessence\u201d.6 Eighteenth-\ncentury investigations of human difference \u201cindicate that ideas about \u201cculture\u201d\nand \u201cbiology\u201d do not occupy separate domains, and that they develop in\nrelation to one another.7 Enquiries into skin colour, for instance, hinged on the\nrelationship between inhabitants\u2019 temperament, disposition and bodily humours,\nand external factors such as climate, commerce and societal development. In\nthis way, environment, mental faculties and bodily appearance were coupled in\na \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d.8 Indeed, given its close relationship with notions\nof \u201clineage\u201d and \u201cbloodline\u201d, the language of \u201crace\u201d could simultaneously\nconnote class, dynasty and societal organization, as well as biological\n4 Roxann Wheeler, The Complexion of Race: Categories of Difference in Eighteenth-Century\nBritish Culture (Philadelphia, 2000), 7, 9\u201310. George Stocking argues that race did not\ncommonly designate \u201cphysical entities unchanged since the beginning of recorded time\u201d\nuntil after the publication of Robert Knox\u2019s The Races of Men (1850). See his Victorian\nAnthropology (New York, 1987), 65.\n5 Colin Kidd, British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic\nWorld, 1600\u20131800 (Cambridge, 1999), 34, 287. Kidd draws upon the definitions of \u201cethnick\u201d\nin the Glossographia (1656) and Samuel Johnson\u2019s Dictionary (1755), though the word\nmeant \u201cpagan\u201d as early as the 1470s. See Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edn (Oxford,\n1989), \u201cethnic\u201d, sense 1.\n6 Wilson, The Island Race, 6\u20138.\n7 Ania Loomba and Jonathan Burton, Introduction, in idem, eds., Race in Early Modern\nEngland: A Documentary Companion (New York, 2007), 8, 22\u20133.\n8 Wheeler, The Complexion of Race, 2\u20135, 22\u20134\n6 paul stock\n\u201cblood ties\u201d and \u201ccommon substance\u201d or essence inherited through physical\nrelations.9\nOften these variable understandings of human difference coexist in the same\ntext. In The Spirit of the Laws, for instance, Montesquieu uses the word \u201crace\u201d to\nmake technical distinctions between social systems across different periods. The\n\u201cfirst race\u201d refers to those Franks who followed Salic and Roman law:\nLe pays qu\u2019on appelle aujourd\u2019hui la France, fut gouverne\u00b4 dans la premie`re race par la loi\nRomaine, ou le code The\u00b4odosien, & par les diverses loix des barbares qui y habitoient . . .\nla loi Salique e\u00b4toit e\u00b4tablie pour les Francs, & le code The\u00b4odosien pour les Romains.\nthe country that today one calls France was governed under the first race by Roman law,\nor the Theodosian code, and by the various laws of the barbarians who lived there . . . the\nSalic Law was established for the Franks and the Theodosian code for the Romans.\nThe \u201csecond race\u201d allowed these semi-centralized legal structures to decline\namidst the rise of fiefdoms: \u201cLes loix Saliques, Bouguignonnes & Wisigothes\nfurent donc extre\u02c6mement ne\u00b4glige\u00b4es a` la fin de la seconde race\u201d (The Salic,\nBurgundian and Visigothic laws were therefore extremely neglected at the end\nof the second race).10 Montesquieu thus uses \u201crace\u201d in an administrative and\nlegal sense, though the term also carries dynastic connotations and hence the\nimplications of \u201clineage\u201d and \u201c(royal) blood\u201d: the most recent English translators\nrender \u201cfirst race\u201d as \u201cMerovingian\u201d and \u201csecond race\u201d as \u201cCarolingian\u201d in order\nto foreground these undertones.11 Indeed, in distinguishing between peoples\u2014\nfor example, Franks and Romans\u2014who are subject to different laws according to\napparent provenance, Montesquieu identifies human groups based upon reputed\n\u201cdescent\u201d. Elsewhere in The Spirit of the Laws, he classifies peoples according to\nphysical characteristics, which in turn indicates their innate \u201cnature\u201d:\nCeux dont il s\u2019agit sont noirs depuis les pieds jusqu\u2019a` la te\u02c6te & ils ont le nez si e\u00b4crase\u00b4 qu\u2019il\nest presqu\u2019 impossible de les plaindre . . . Il est si naturel de penser, que c\u2019est la couleur qui\nconstitue l\u2019essence de l\u2019humanite\u00b4 . . . Il est impossible que nous supposion que ces gens la`\nsoient des hommes.\n9 Elizabeth Colwill, \u201cSex, Savagery and Slavery in the Shaping of the French Body Politic\u201d,\nin Sara E.

It is so natural to think that colour constitutes\nthe essence of humanity . . . It is impossible for us to assume that these people are men.12\nFor Montesquieu, therefore, physical appearance can still facilitate the physical,\nmoral and intellectual categorization of different peoples. In turn, the prospect\nof these classificatory practices allows the potential identification of a \u201cEuropean\nrace\u201d or \u201craces\u201d.\nthe \u201ceuropean\u201d race(s)\nHow, then, did eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century thinkers identify\nEuropean \u201crace(s)\u201d? Broadly speaking, this question encompasses two\neighteenth-century debates about human origins and difference. First, it is a\npart of the monogenesis\u2013polygenesis enquiry into human origins: the scholarly\nand religious debate about whether humanity is a single species, or whether there\nare many human species which were created separately.13 Second, it incorporates\nrelated disputes about the extent to which human differences are essentially fixed\nand unchanging, or whether other factors, such as climate, migration or social\nstructures, can cause diverse human groups to develop and alter over time. These\nissues reverberate throughout attempts to categorize and distinguish humans.\nIn his Systema naturae (first edition 1735, tenth edition 1758) Carl von\nLinne\u00b4 (Linnaeus) divides humans into four groups corresponding to continents\n(americanus, europaeus, asiaticus, and afer), as well as giving a fifth category,\nmonstrosus, which includes giants and other extraordinary varieties. However,\nthese are not straightforwardly geographical distinctions, since they can be\ndistinguished by physical features (especially skin colour), personality, behaviour\nand intellect, as well as by their preferred system of government. Europeans, for\nexample, have white skin, are \u201cintelligent\u201d and \u201cinventive\u201d and are governed by\n\u201claw\u201d, whereas the asiaticus are \u201cmelancholy\u201d, \u201cgreedy\u201d and ruled by \u201copinion\u201d\n(for example by the lawless will of a despot).14 Linne\u00b4\u2019s system therefore\ndistinguishes between people according to several criteria: geographical location,\n12 Montesquieu, De l\u2019esprit des loix, 1: 343. The translation is from Spirit of the Laws, trans.\nCohler, Miller and Stone, 250.\n13 Related debates have not entirely disappeared. Recent discussions about the origins\nof Homo sapiens encompass the \u201cout-of-Africa\u201d theory, which postulates that modern\nhumans evolved in Africa and spread from there, and the \u201cmultiregional\u201d theory, which\nsuggests that the species evolved simultaneously in many locations across the world. See\nRoger Lewin, Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins, 2nd edn\n(Chicago, 1997), 323\u201335.\n14 For an English tabulation of Linne\u00b4\u2019s human varieties see Jonathan Marks, \u201cSystematics\nin Anthropology\u201d, in G. A. Clark and C. M. Willermet, eds., Conceptual Issues in Modern\n8 paul stock\nsocietal differences (e.g. in governmental system) and \u201cnatural\u201d non-acquired\ncharacteristics. To describe someone as a \u201cEuropean\u201d, therefore, is not only to\nspecify their location and to describe their social system, it is also to make\nassertions about their disposition, moral conduct and intelligence. Linne\u00b4\u2019s\nclassificatory method potentially facilitates what Nancy Stepan calls \u201ctypological\nthinking\u201d, whereby individual humans are seen as belonging to \u201can undying\nessence or type\u201d.15 This reifies the idea of static differences between homogeneous\ngroups, variations being \u201cfixed eternally by divine will that is also an order defined\nby hierarchical gradations\u201d.16 From such a basis, it is possible to hypothesize a\n\u201cEuropean race\u201d in which certain shared mental and physical characteristics are\nenduringly consistent.\nIn 1749, Linne\u00b4\u2019s antagonist Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon insisted that there\nis \u201cune seule espe`ce d\u2019hommes\u201d (\u201conly one species of man\u201d), and that varieties\nhave emerged \u201cpar l\u2019influence du climat, par la diffe\u00b4rence de la nourriture, par\ncelle de la manie`re de vivre, par les maladies e\u00b4pide\u00b4miques, et aussi par le me\u00b4lange\nvarie\u00b4 a` l\u2019infini des individus plus ou mois ressemblents\u201d (\u201cby the influence of\nclimate, by differences of food, by manner of living, by epidemic diseases, and\nalso by the varied mixing of infinite individuals more or less alike\u201d). In other\nwords, human varieties develop through a combination of environmental factors\nand hereditary influences. Furthermore, different groups\u2014sometimes referred\nto by the word \u201crace\u201d\u2014are identifiable by both physical appearance and social\npractice: \u201cils se ressemblent par la forme, par la taille, par la couleur, par les\nmoeurs, et me\u02c6me par la bizarrerie des coutumes\u201d (\u201cthey resemble each other in\nform, in height, in colour, in manners, and even in peculiarity of customs\u201d).17\nUsing these criteria, Buffon includes \u201cles peuples de l\u2019Europe\u201d among a wider\ncategory of people \u201cqui habitent sous un climat plus tempe\u00b4re\u00b4\u201d (\u201cwho live in a most\ntemperate climate\u201d), comprising Moguls, Persians, Armenians, Turks, Greeks and\nothers. This might seem to challenge the idea of a uniquely European \u201crace\u201d by\nassimilating European peoples into a broader grouping defined by climatological\nfactors. Nevertheless, he still occasionally makes undeveloped remarks about\nthe distinctiveness of different European peoples: \u201cil est aise\u00b4 de reconna\u0131\u02c6tre un\nEspagnol de toutes les autres nations europe\u00b4ennes\u201d (\u201cit is easy to distinguish a\nHuman Origins Research (New York, 1997), 46\u20137.

For Buffon\u2019s (inconsistent) use\nof the word \u201crace\u201d see Hudson, \u201cFrom \u2018Nation\u2019 to \u2018Race\u2019\u201d, 253\u20135.\n\u201calmost a separate race\u201d 9\nSpaniard from all the other European nations\u201d). More significantly, Buffon asserts\nthat the \u201ctemperate peoples\u201d are \u201cles plus beaux, les plus blancs et les mieux faits\nde toute la terre\u201d (\u201cthe most beautiful, the most white and the most well made of\nall the earth\u201d).18 This opens a significant connection between aesthetic judgement\nand the categorization of humans. In other words, the physical beauty or ugliness\nof an individual could not only reflect their own \u201cinterior moral being\u201d, it could\nalso reveal the generalized qualities of whole peoples. This correlation between\naesthetic ideas (that is, cultural preferences) and physical difference made sense\nto contemporaries given the assumption that \u201chuman beauty . . .was assumed\nto be a biological means of creating mutual attraction leading to procreation\nand the continuation of the species of humanity\u201d.19 In this way, for Buffon, the\nidentification of a \u201cEuropean\u201d is a matter of physical form, aesthetic evaluation,\nand spatial and environmental designation.\nJohann Friedrich Blumenbach, \u201cthe most influential theorist of human variety\nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century\u201d,20 also identified a human\ncategory particular to Europe. In De generis humani varietate nativa (1775), he\nidentified four \u201cclasses of inhabitants\u201d, later adding a fifth class in the second\nedition (1781):\nThe first of these and the largest, which is also the primeval one, embraces the whole of\nEurope, including the Lapps, whom I cannot in any way separate from the rest of the\nEuropeans . . .; and that western part of Asia, which lies towards us, this side of the Obi,\nthe Caspian Sea, Mount Taurus, and the Ganges; also north Africa; and lastly, in America,\nthe Greenlanders and Esquimaux, for I see in these people a wonderful difference from\nthe other inhabitants of America . . . All these nations, regarded as a whole, are white in\ncolour, and, if compared with the rest, beautiful in form.21\nIn the third edition of this work (1795), Blumenbach labels this group \u201cCaucasian\u201d,\na term still used in the twenty-first century to describe people with white skin.22\nHowever, the implications of Blumenbach\u2019s classification are multifarious. He\ndescribes white people as one variety who inhabit the whole geographical space\nof Europe. But this variety cannot be described in any straightforward way as\n18 Buffon, Oeuvres, 2: 621\u20134.\n19 David Bindman, Ape to Apollo: Aesthetics and the Idea of Race in the Eighteenth Century\n(London, 2002), 12, 20.\n20 Kitson, Theories of Race, 141\n21 J.

Moreover,\nBlumenbach suggests that \u201cthe cradle of the human race lay in the Caucasus\nwhence the species had dispersed over the globe, climactic differences bringing\nabout human variations\u201d.23 In other words, he argues for the unified origins of the\nhuman race by refusing to identify separate human species, while simultaneously\nasserting the aesthetic and historical primacy of one particular variation. In\nthis respect, Blumenbach strives to demonstrate the original unity of all human\npeoples, while also legitimizing the separation of those peoples into various\ngroups. By definition, Blumenbach\u2019s theory could not imply the permanency\nof differences, since it was premised upon deviation from an original norm.\nNevertheless, his categorizations downplay variety within groups in order to\nunderscore \u201cdistinctions between groups\u201d, an implication which could encourage\na \u201clarger effort to fix racial types\u201d.24\nClearly, then, questions about human difference reverberated unresolved\nthroughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In his lecture\n\u201cOn the Causes of the Varieties of the Human Species\u201d, William Lawrence\nsummarizes these contemporary debates: \u201care distinctions coeval with the\norigins of the species, or as the result of subsequent variation\u201d, and, in the\nlatter case, are they caused by \u201cexternal physical and moral causes, or [by]\nnative or congenital variety\u201d?25 This statement is partly a development of the\nmonogenesis\u2013polygenesis inquiry, but it also demonstrates burgeoning interest\nin the relationship between environment and congenital inheritance. In the mid-\neighteenth century, Pierre-Louise Moreau de Maupertuis had begun to explore\nthe problems of biological inheritance. He noted that children usually resemble\ntheir parents and concluded that some unknown biological mechanism causes\ncharacteristics to be passed on through the generations. He also realized that,\nin animals and birds, certain natural variations could be deliberately bred and\naccentuated to create creatures with slightly different characteristics. But how do\nsuch variations arise? Maupertuis speculated that environmental factors have an\ninfluence:\nJe n\u2019exclus pas l\u2019influence que le climat & les alimens peuvent y avoir. Il semble que la\nchaleur de la Zone torride, soit plus propre a` fomenter les parties qui rendent la peau\n23 H. F.

It would seem that the heat of\nthe torrid zone is more favourable to the particles that compose black skin than to those\nthat make up white skin. And I simply do not know how far this kind of influence of\nclimate and food may go after many centuries.26\nFor Maupertuis, then, environmental circumstances give rise to variations which\nthen become hereditary: \u201cCe n\u2019est que par quelque accident que le noir est devenu\nune couleur he\u00b4re\u00b4ditaire aux grandes familles qui peuplent la Zone torride\u201d (\u201cIt\nis only by some accident that black has become a hereditary colour in the great\nfamilies which populate the torrid zone\u201d).27 Lawrence follows a similar line\nof thinking: humans are of one species, but have undergone changes \u201cby the\ninfluence of climate, food, mode of living, epidemic diseases\u201d. Such changes\nare then \u201ctransmitted from generation to generation\u201d, \u201cby the continual action\nof the same causes\u201d. Like Maupertuis, Lawrence fuses environmentalism with\nhereditary biology, proposing a solution based on \u201crace\u201d, which he uses in the\nsense of \u201ccongenital variety of a single species\u201d. Thus there are three \u201craces\u201d in\nEurope: Celts, Germans and Slavs, all part of the same species, but congenitally\ndifferent from one another. Races are distinct in a moral sense too: the Negro\ndisposition is \u201ccruel and barbarous\u201d, though Lawrence is undecided whether this\nis a cause or an effect of congenital variation. For him, it is entirely legitimate to\nspeak of a single human species and culturally and biologically distinct races.28\nA related idea is evident in James Cowles Prichard\u2019s Researches into the Physical\nHistory of Man (1813). He speaks of \u201cNegroes\u201d and \u201cEuropeans\u201d as dissimilar\nvariations of a single human species. This \u201cobvious gradation\u201d is identifiable \u201cin\nthe shape of the skull, from the European to the negro, bearing a ratio to the degree\nof colour\u201d. However, such physical variation is dependent upon circumstantial\ninfluences: \u201cin races which are experiencing the effects of civilisation, a temperate\nclimate increases the tendency to the light variety [of skin colour]\u201d. In other words,\nthe development of (European) civilization directly causes physical variation. In\nthe same way that \u201clocal causes\u201d form new \u201craces\u201d from existing animal species\u2014\nfor example, white mice will be produced if their parents are kept in the dark\u2014so\ntoo do new human varieties emerge from changes in social organization. For\nthis reason, the original pair were black, and \u201cthe progress of nature has been\n26 Maupertuis, Venus physique, contenant deux dissertations, l\u2019une sur l\u2019origine des hommes\net des animaux; et l\u2019autre sur l\u2019origine des noirs (La Haye, 1746), 144\u20135.

Humans change according to environmental and societal circumstances,\nbut then settle into hereditary (and thus near permanent) differences of intellect,\ncultural refinement and physical appearance. Those consolidated differences,\nin turn, facilitate further distinctive change: \u201cthe influence of moral causes in\nmodifying the efficacy of natural causes is . . . very considerable\u201d.29 Prichard\u2019s\nideas act as a bridge between social and biological theories of difference: culture\nand climate initiate change, but also legitimize the distinction and description\nof various congenital \u201craces\u201d.30 In this way, Prichard makes it possible to identify\nessential differences from observation of social practice.\nFor Prichard, as well as the other thinkers I have examined so far, the primary\nintellectual challenge is to maintain an orthodox monogenetic perspective\nwhile still adequately explaining human difference. Polygenesis offers a different\nsolution, though it still encompasses similar questions about climate and human\nadaptability. In 1778 Lord Kames, for instance, had used \u201crace\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cspecies\u201d: there are many distinct human races, he says, each \u201cfitted for different\nclimates\u201d and with different \u201ctempers and dispositions\u201d. These \u201craces\u201d are\npermanently hereditary and do not change according to social or spatial factors: a\nEuropean can \u201cfor years expose himself to the sun in a hot climate, till he be quite\nbrown, [but] his children will nevertheless have the same complexion with those\nin Europe\u201d. In this way, Kames reconfigures climatological arguments: human\nforms and behaviours are not shaped by climates; instead humans are created\nwith different appearances and qualities in order to fit particular environments\nbetter. Unlike Prichard, Kames separates human categories absolutely: there is\nno possibility of change and a limited capacity for interaction between races.\nHorses, he suggests, can breed together, because they are of \u201cone kind\u201d. But\n\u201cmen are not all of one kind; for if a White mix with a Black\u201d the result will be \u201ca\nmongrel breed differing from both parents\u201d.31 Kames\u2019s theories make \u201cEuropean\u201d\ninto a distinctive biological category, identified principally by skin colour and\nother physical features. Polygenesis, of course, remained a relatively unorthodox\ntheory, not least because it contradicted the Genesis creation story.32 It still\n29 James Cowles Prichard, Researches into the Physical History of Man (London, 1813), 231\u20133,\n206\u20139, 236, 209.\n30 See Wheeler, Complexion of Race, 295\u20136.

In his History of Jamaica (1774), for\nexample, Edward Long edges towards polygenesis when he suggests,\nWhen we reflect on the nature of [black people], and their dissimilarity to the rest of\nmankind, must we not concluded that they are a different species of the same genus?\n. . . Every member of the creation is wisely fitted and adapted to their certain uses, and\nconfined within their certain bounds.\nLong insists on permanent and innate differences in physical appearance, and\nsocial and intellectual capacity: black people, he says, are \u201cvoid of genius, and\nseem incapable of making any progress in civility or science\u201d, an assumption\nwhich legitimizes their exploitation by purportedly superior Europeans.33\nMost racial thinkers, however, step back from the unconventional doctrinal\nimplications of polygenesis. John Bigland, writing in 1816, suggests that \u201crace\u201d\u2014\nin the sense of \u201cbodily and mental faculties . . . perpetuated in hereditary descent\u201d,\nsuch as \u201cstrength, courage, genius and other gifts of nature\u2019\u2014is a more accurate\nway of dividing peoples than social custom, since \u201cwe are sometimes unable\nto discover any difference in government, laws or religion\u201d. Accordingly, he\ndecides that \u201cEuropeans . . . are a visible distinction of race\u201d in comparison\nto Asiatics, Africans and Americans, although, in a nod to orthodoxy, it is \u201cnot\nimprobable\u201d that all are descended from Noah. However, he immediately admits\nthat \u201camong the European nations . . . all distinctions of race, which might once\nhave existed, are long since confounded\u201d\u2014Greeks and Romans are a mixture of\nEgyptians, Phoenicians, and Celts; Franks and Saxons a blend of Gauls, Celts,\nBritons and Normans.34 Bigland proposes an overarching European identity, but\nthen instantly collapses this into competing factions. Despite his own principle\nnot to divide by social custom, he also uses civilizations (\u201cGreek\u201d, \u201cRoman\u201d) as\nthe foundation for racial groupings, a strategy which shows how, for Bigland\nand other racial thinkers, societal and essential differences between peoples are\ninterdependent and mutually illuminating.\nIn summary, then, discussion of human difference\u2014and the identification\nof \u201cEuropean\u201d people\u2014is related to several recurring and interlocking debates\nabout human \u201cnature\u201d, hereditary qualities, climatic influence, and aesthetic\njudgements. The key question, however, concerns the extent to which these\n33 Edward Long, The History of Jamaica, 3 vols. (London, 1774), 2: 356, 374\u20135, 353.

There is evidence that such disputes were part\nof wider public discourses about human categorization. For example, Charles\nWhite\u2019s Account of the Regular Gradation in Man (1799) reports that there\n\u201csubsists a characteristic difference in the bony system betwixt the European\nand the African\u201d, that \u201cthere are material differences in the corporal organisation\nof various classes of mankind\u201d and that the European stands \u201cat the head, as\nbeing the farthest removed from the brute creation\u201d.35 A reviewer in the Monthly\nReview censures this conclusion the following year, attacking White for falsely\nassuming that Europeans embody a more advanced \u201cgradation\u201d of humankind.36\nThis review is significant because it shows that the questions under dispute\nduring this period\u2014particularly whether there are specifically European forms\nof behaviour and physical appearance\u2014were not restricted to specialist works\nbut also received serious attention in review magazines and other books targeted\nat a general readership. There are several potential places to examine the dispersal\nof racial thinking in this period, periodicals, travel narratives and imperial\ndocuments perhaps being the most obvious.37 Here, however, I wish to show\nhow uncertainties about the European race(s) recur throughout encyclopedias\nand their source texts.\nencyclopedias and the \u201ceuropean race\u201d\nEncyclopedias are a useful way to assess a period\u2019s culture and assumptions:\nthey purport to summarize received knowledge and can thus reveal much about\ncontemporary \u201cintellectual, political, economic and social life\u201d, particularly the\n\u201cextent of the reception and diffusion\u201d of certain key ideas.38 That said, one must\nbe careful not to assume a direct correlation between encyclopedic content and the\nzeitgeist. As Frank Kafker observes, some encyclopedias presented information\nin an idiosyncratic manner: the first edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica (1768\u2013\n71), for example, avoided discussion of biography and \u201cmechanical arts\u201d, while\n35 Charles White, An Account of the Regular Gradation in Man, and in Difference Animals and\nVegetables; and from the Former to the Latter (London, 1799), 55, 83.

By contrast, others could be\nunadventurous and conventional in seeking to uphold \u201cdominant religious,\npolitical and social institutions\u201d.39 Nevertheless, according to Richard Yeo,\nencyclopedias were a key means by which important ideas were transmitted\nto a wider audience: Chambers\u2019s Cyclopaedia (1728), for instance, was central in\nthe dissemination of Lockean and Newtonian ideas \u201cto a readership that extended\nbeyond elite scholars\u201d. In this sense, encyclopedias were key components in the\nexpanding \u201cpublic character of information\u201d since they were pitched at \u201cthe\nmajority of educated, but not necessarily university-educated, readers . . . rather\nthan only specialists\u201d.40 It is, of course, difficult to determine the precise audience\nof encyclopedias. They were expensive: the first edition of Britannica appeared\nin a hundred weekly instalments costing between sixpence and eightpence each,\nand the whole set cost between \u00a32 10s and \u00a33 7s (fifty to sixty-seven shillings)\ndepending on paper quality. A labourer in this period would be fortunate to\nearn ten shillings per week, meaning that the encyclopedia would cost about five\nto seven weeks\u2019 income. Even for a gentleman with an income of five pounds\n(a hundred shillings) per week, an encyclopedia was a significant purchase.41\nDespite this, Britannica reached print runs of five thousand\u2014ten thousand by\nthe late eighteenth century\u2014and, as reference books, encyclopedias probably\nhad many more readers than purchasers: Britannica especially became \u201cvirtually\na compulsory acquisition for any self-respecting multi-disciplinary institution\u201d.42\nIn what follows, I have consulted entries on \u201cEurope\u201d in every British encyclopedia\ncompleted between 1771 and 1830 (as well as named source texts for those entries)\nin order to show how certain racial ideas about \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cEuropeans\u201d were\ndisseminated in general reference texts.43\n39 Kafker, \u201cWilliam Smellie\u2019s Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica\u201d and idem, \u201cThe\ninfluence of the Encyclope\u00b4die on the Eighteenth-Century Encyclopaedic Tradition\u201d, both\nin Notable Encyclopaedias, 155\u20137, 395.\n40 Richard Yeo, Encyclopaedic Visions: Scientific Dictionaries and Enlightenment Culture\n(Cambridge, 2001), 158\u20139, 163\u20136, xiii, 51.\n41 Kafter, \u201cWilliam Smellie\u2019s Edition\u201d, 148; William St Clair, The Reading Nation in the\nRomantic Period (Cambridge, 2004), 193\u20136.

I have, however, investigated every occasion when an article on\n\u201cEurope\u201d mentions a work or an authority by name. These materials often name other\ninfluences not acknowledged directly by encyclopedias. The Encyclopaedia Londinesis\n(1810\u201324), for example, cites John Pinkerton\u2019s Modern Geography (1802), which in turn\ndraws upon the anonymous Complete System of Geography (1747), Fenning and Collyer\u2019s\n16 paul stock\nIn their articles on \u201cEurope\u201d, some encyclopedias argue that Europeans can\nbe considered collectively as a distinctive human variety. The second edition of\nEncyclopaedia Britannica (1777\u201384) declares that European \u201cinhabitants are all\nwhite; and incomparably more handsome than the Africans, and even most of\nthe Asians\u201d, echoing the aesthetic arguments of Buffon and others.44 The English\nEncyclopaedia (1802) proclaims that Europeans \u201care much better made than the\nAfricans, or even the Asiatics\u201d (emphasis added), which implies a distinctiveness\nand superiority from the moment of creation rather than acquired advantages.45\nDue to vagaries of vocabulary, it is not always clear whether these texts are\narguing, in the polygenist manner, for a separate European race or for a distinctive\nsubdivision of the whole human race. The latter is perhaps more likely in most\ncases: Silvia Sebastiani suggests that eighteenth-century encyclopedias are usually\nmonogenist in order to be doctrinally orthodox.46 Either way, the articles identify\nunique physical features particular to Europeans (skin colour, physical beauty).\nCrucially, however, this identification often accompanies an assertion of\nsocial superiority. The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia (1808\u201330) suggests that European\n\u201cprogress in knowledge and arts raised them above the inhabitants of other\ndivisions, that they seem almost a separate race\u201d.47 The key word here is \u201calmost\u201d,\nfor shortly afterwards the writer reiterates the monogenist theory that the human\nrace emerged from Asia and that all peoples are traceable to the same genesis.\nIn this respect, he is working firmly within established traditions which lent\nAsia Minor and the Caucasus considerable ideological resonance. Not only was\nit the apocryphal location of the Garden of Eden, Jason\u2019s quest for the Golden\nFleece and Prometheus\u2019 punishment by Zeus, it was also the reputed place where\nthe Ark came to rest, and was hence the wellspring for the repopulation of the\nworld by Noah\u2019s sons.48 Yet the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia does not believe that all\nthese descendents have the same innate capabilities: Europeans excel in \u201cactivity\nNew System of Geography (1765\u20136) and Middleton\u2019s New and Complete System of Geography\n(1777).

Additionally, \u201cEuropeans surpass\n[Africans and Asians] in arts and sciences . . . in trade, navigation, and in military\nand civil affairs, being, at the same time, more prudent, more valiant, more\ngenerous, more polite and more sociable than they\u201d.50 Similarly, the Encyclopaedia\nEdinensis (1816\u201327) declares that, in Europe, \u201cthe state of civilisation, of science,\nliterature, arts, military tactics, and commercial enterprise, is more perfect,\nand on a more extensive scale . . . and the moral character more dignified\nand pure than any other quarter of the globe\u201d.51 Moral qualities (valour,\ngenerosity) are associated with the advantages of an allegedly superior civil\nsystem. In this respect, \u201cEuropean\u201d does not just denote a kind of society or\nbehavioural code, it also signifies a type of person: these texts fuse together\ndevelopmental progress with the concept of an unchanging European nature:\nEuropeans have distinguished themselves through their \u201cinborn faculties\u201d or\n\u201cnatural abilities\u201d and the sociological application of those talents. The roots\nof this fusion are evident in eighteenth-century geographical works. The 1747\nComplete System of Geography claims that Europeans have asserted themselves\nthrough social triumphs (military conquests, \u201cScholastic Sciences\u201d, \u201cthe Invention\nand Improvement of many useful and ingenious Arts\u201d) and their innate \u201cGenius\u201d.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, in the eighteenth century the word\n\u201cgenius\u201d meant, amongst other things, \u201cnatural ability or capacity\u201d, \u201cnatural\naptitude\u201d and \u201ccharacteristic disposition\u201d of a person or people.52 Europeans,\nin other words, have distinguished themselves in both \u201cGenius and Industry\u201d\u2014\nthrough their \u201cinborn faculties\u201d or \u201cnatural abilities\u201d and the application of\nthose talents.53 These two factors are intimately connected: pre-eminent civic\nstructures reveal the capabilities of \u201cGenius\u201d and those same social forms enable\nthe demonstration of further innate brilliance.\nAs with the racial thinkers I examined above, these accounts reveal an\nattempt to integrate \u201cinnate\u201d and \u201cacquired\u201d qualities in identifying \u201cEuropeans\u201d.\nBritannica\u2019s fourth edition (1800\u20139) proclaims that the \u201cbenevolent Parent of the\nuniverse\u201d granted Europeans \u201cgreater bodily vigour and intellectual strength\u201d.\nThis implies that Europeans have always been more intelligent, vigorous and\n49 The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, 9: 238, 235.\n50 The Modern Encyclopaedia, 10 vols.

However, it also describes the long\nEuropean drive towards progress in \u201cdiffusion of knowledge, the extension of\nindustry and the civilisation of manners\u201d.54 \u201cEurope\u201d is thus understood partly\nas a developmental process of ideas, conventions, discussions and discoveries,\nand partly as a static entity, granted certain benefits by God. Europeans are both\ndynamic participants in a superior social network, the agents and subjects of\n\u201cprogress\u201d, and unchanging created beings, made with specific characteristics\nor advantages which are never lost. As well as revealing divergent ideas\nabout \u201cEuropeans\u201d, this tension also reflects broader eighteenth-century debates\nabout how to understand human difference in terms of societal participation,\ndevelopmental progress, and unchanging \u201cnatural\u201d qualities.\nAs part of this wider debate, other works explore how \u201cracial\u201d notions of\nEurope interact with ideas about space and migration. In his System of Geography\n(1777), Charles Middleton suggested that \u201cwhen the Asiatics and African regions\nbecame the seats of tyranny and despotism\u201d, more \u201cliberally-disposed\u201d Asian and\nAfrican peoples migrated \u201cnorthwards and sought for that liberty in less prolific\nclimates\u201d. For this reason, \u201cEurope, the less extensive and wealthy, became more\npolished and powerful than the other two parts of the world\u201d.55 The theory is\ndependent upon essential difference: early Europeans were distinguished from\nordinary Asians by their \u201cliberal\u201d disposition and were thus distinct even before\nthey moved into European space. When Middleton says that Europeans are \u201cbetter\nmade\u201d or that in Europe \u201cthe human mind has made the greatest progress\u201d, he\nmeans that their innate abilities have inclined them towards particular social\nsystems: Europeans were identifiable long before \u201cEurope\u201d became a social\nor spatial term.56 The Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1806\u20137) also identifies\ndispositional differences between Asians and Europeans. Having concluded that\nno obvious spatial boundary between Asia and Europe exists, the distinction is\ninstead \u201cethical, as the manners of the Asiatic subjects of Russia, and even Turkey,\ndiffer considerably from those of the European inhabitants of those islands\u201d.57\nThis might seem to suggest contrasting forms of customary behaviour, but in fact\nthe implication is more complex. According to the author, Asian and European\npeoples in the same community or locale still behave differently, which suggests\nthat Asian and European \u201cmanners\u201d are partly related to dispositional and not\n54 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 4th edn, 20 vols.

Like some of the texts above, the 1824 Supplement to Britannica suggests\nthat European denotes mental capacity:\nIt is only in Europe . . . that the powers of the human mind . . . have developed that\nprinciple of progressive improvement . . . It is only in Europe that knowledge and the arts\nseem to be indigenous. Though they have appeared at times among some of the nations\nof Asia, they have either stopped short after advancing a few steps, or they have speedily\nretrograded and perished, like something foreign to the genius of the people.58\nThese sentences postulate that European social achievements depend upon\ninherent capabilities not possessed by other peoples. Moreover, they imply that\n\u201cEuropean\u201d is a single \u201cracial\u201d category: Europeans can be identified as a collective\nbecause they all have broadly similar \u201cindigenous\u201d talents. In this sense, therefore,\n\u201cEuropean\u201d alludes to a person\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d, and not just their circumstances or\nacquired skills. Later, however, it talks of the \u201cdifferent races of inhabitants\u201d of\nEurope, distinguishing them by \u201clanguage, manners or physical constitution\u201d.\nSouth-western Europeans are, for instance, naturally \u201cmore inventive and less\npersevering\u201d.59 This establishes a Europe in which a variety of distinct tribal groups\ncompete with one another, weakening the racial totality formerly implied. The\nSupplement thus presents contending understandings of Europe\u2019s people: are they\n\u201cby nature\u201d alike, or driven to competition because they are essentially distinct?\nThe next section explores some of these challenges to European racial wholeness\npresented in other contemporary historical and geographical books.\nencyclopedias and the europe of many races\nMany encyclopedia articles reject the idea of a single European people in\norder to identify competing ethnic groups in \u201cEurope\u201d. These works use the word\n\u201cEuropean\u201d to refer collectively to all these groups, not to mark out a single\nEuropean \u201crace\u201d. This usage invests the idea of Europe with spatial connotations:\ndissimilar groups are connected only because they share the same space. Several\nworks argue that there are three \u201cancient peoples of Europe\u201d: Celts, Finns and\nLaplanders. Subsequently, these tribes were pushed westwards by migrating\n58 Supplement to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 6 vols.\n(Edinburgh and London, 1824), 4: 181.\n59 Ibid., 4: 187.\n20 paul stock\nAsians, specifically Goths and \u201cSclavonics\u201d (Slavs).60 The encyclopedias seek\nto build divergent European identities on these movements and confrontations:\n\u201cEuropean\u201d alludes both to a complex ethnographic mixture caused by millennia\nof such interactions and to distinct groupings identifiable throughout history\nand in the modern period.\nThese analyses bear significant resemblance to the racial ideas of John\nPinkerton, the historian, poet and geographer.61 The encyclopedias employ the\ntheory, expressed in Pinkerton\u2019s Modern Geography (1802), that most modern\nEuropeans are descended from Asian Goths (also known as Scythians).62 This was\nnot in itself a unique hypothesis: the idea that the human race originated in Asia,\nand that Noah\u2019s son Japhet fathered peoples who migrated westwards, was derived\nfrom ancient sources and became relatively conventional in the early eighteenth\ncentury.63 Pinkerton, however, disconnects this premise from its monogenist,\ntheological connotations. His thesis is outlined most fully in A Dissertation on\nthe Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths, the primary purpose of which is\nto trace the movements of the Goths, who, Pinkerton contends, are the founders\nof nearly all European societies (including Greece and Rome). However, it also\nidentifies four \u201cGrand Races of Men\u201d in ancient Europe: Celts (\u201cwho were to the\nother races of men what the savages of America are to the Europeans\u201d), Iberi\n(\u201cwho had past from Africa\u201d), Sarmatae or Sclavonics (who occupied Russia\nand Poland) and Goths\u2013Scythians.64 These reflections place heavy emphasis on\nmigration since only one people, the Celts, are indigenous to European space. He\nalso speaks explicitly about biological categories, not social groups:\nthe Scythians were neither Celts, Sarmartians, nor Tartars, no more than a horse is an\nelephant, a lion or a tiger . . . A Tartar, a Negro, an American, &c., &c, differ as much from\na German, as a bull-dog, or lap-dog, shepherd\u2019s cur, from a pointer. The differences are\nradical; and such as no climate or chance would produce.\n60 This theory appears in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 4th edn; The Cyclopaedia; or Universal\nDictionary of Arts, Sciences and Literature, 39 vols.

In attempting to reconcile classical\nand Jewish history, early church chronologers integrated the Scythian tradition\nwith biblical genealogy: in the first century AD, Josephus argued that the Scythians\ndescended from Japhet\u2019s son Magog. Furthermore, because their traditional\nhomeland in the Caucasus was the reputed place where the waters of the Flood\nreceded, the Scythians were necessarily one of the most ancient peoples on\nearth from whom others derived.67 Importantly, too, Tacitus\u2019 Germania had\nlegitimized a connection between German peoples and the ancient Scythians\nand Sarmatians of central Asia: his account of German society and behaviour\nclosely matches Posidonius\u2019 and Herodotus\u2019 much earlier descriptions of the\nScythians.68 Later, in the sixth century, Jordanes and Isidore of Seville amplified\nthis relationship, arguing that Scythians and German Goths shared a common\nancestry and that they had populated all Europe following widespread migrations.\n\u201cFrom this time onwards\u201d, says James Johnson, \u201cthe Scythian enjoyed new glory\nas the parent of virtually every nation in Europe\u201d. He goes on to suggest that, by\nthe eighteenth century, the Scythian\u2013Gothic theory had fallen into \u201cobscurity\u201d,\nalthough Pinkerton\u2019s use of a related idea, as well as its presence in other\ncontemporary books, instead suggests its ongoing resonance.69\nIt would be misleading, of course, to ascribe artificial uniformity to these\nvarious retellings of Scythian\u2013Gothic ancestry. Jordanes, for example, argued\nthat the Scythians derived from Scandinavia and moved from there to central\n65 Pinkerton, Dissertation, vii, 33\u20134.\n66 Pinkerton, Dissertation, iii.

Thom draws upon Eduard Norden\u2019s Die Germanische Urgeschichte in Tacitus\nGermania (1920) to suggest that these resemblances were perhaps the consequence of\ngeneric conventions in classical ethnographic writing, rather than an attempt to posit\ndirect descent from the Scythians to the Germans.\n69 Olender, \u201cEurope, or How to Escape Babel\u201d, 12; Droixhe, La linguistique, 87; Johnson, \u201cThe\nScythian\u201d, 256\u20137.\n22 paul stock\nAsia.70 Furthermore, there was significant controversy regarding the relationship\nof the Scythians to other ancient groups. Scythians and Celts were often conflated,\ncreating what Colin Kidd calls \u201ca recipe for ethnological confusion\u201d. In his\nGermania antiqua (1616) Philip Cluverius grouped Scythians and Celts together,\nbut, unlike Tacitus, distinguished them sharply from the Sarmatians or Slavs. By\ncontrast, Leibniz separated Celtic\u2013Germans from Scythian\u2013Slavs, since the two\ngroups were apparently descended from different branches of Japhet\u2019s family.71\nDespite these bewildering complexities, caused partly by vague and shifting\nterminologies, the Scythian\u2013Gothic theory has one particularly significant\nimplication. By assuming that most peoples in Europe are traceable to a common\n(biblical) ancestry, the theory presumes that Europeans are closely interrelated. In\nthe eighteenth century, it was therefore possible to speak about \u201cEurope\u2019s shared\nGothic origins\u201d: \u201chistorians agreed that most of the political nations of Europe\nshared common ethnic origins. The people of Europe, they argued, were largely\nthe descendents of libertarian Gothic peoples\u201d.72 Furthermore, the Scythians\u2019\nmigrations even posited connections between European and Asian peoples:\neighteenth-century travellers and geographers even associated the Chinese with\nthe \u201cancient Scythians\u201d.73\nThese implications make Pinkerton\u2019s use of the Scythian\u2013Gothic theory all the\nmore startling. His identification of Europe\u2019s Gothic heritage is motivated not by\na straightforward conception of European racial unity, but by a virulent distaste\nfor Celts and an urge to account for the separate derivation of European peoples.\nIn contrast with earlier thinkers, he firmly separates Scythians\u2013Goths from Celts,\narguing that the former, in the guise of Picts and Saxons, displaced the barbaric\nCelts in England and lowland Scotland.74 This has an Anglophile purpose in that\nPinkerton tries to \u201cblur the differences between Scots Lowlanders and the English\nnation, and to sharpen differences between Highlanders and Lowlanders within\nthe Scottish nation\u201d.75 However, by railing against authors who have mistakenly\n70 Johnson, \u201cThe Scythian\u201d, 256.\n71 Kidd, British Identities, 187\u2013191; Droixhe, La linguistique, 133; idem, De l\u2019origine du language\naux langues du monde (Tu\u00a8bingen, 1987), 73\u20134.\n72 Kidd, British Identities, 227\u201331; idem, \u201cEthnicity on the British Atlantic World, 1688\u20131830\u201d,\nin Kathleen Wilson, ed., A New Imperial History: Culture, Identity and Modernity in Britain\nand the Empire, 1660\u20131840 (Cambridge, 2004), 275.\n73 Kitson, Romanticism, Race and Colonial Encounter (New York, 2007), 153.

Pinkerton proclaims himself dissatisfied\nwith biblical genealogy: he argues that Jewish traditions and holy books are\nsuperseded by Christianity and are therefore \u201cnot binding on our faith\u201d. Indeed,\nunderstandings of ancient chronology have been \u201cruined\u201d by desperate attempts\nto \u201cforce it to Scripture\u201d: \u201cif we have recourse to Scripture for accounts of the\norigins of men, or of nations, we shall be shockingly deceived\u201d. Liberated from\nthe orthodox presumption of a common origin for all peoples, Pinkerton instead\nembraces polygenesis. \u201cNature\u201d, he argues,\nnot only produces different classes of animals, but also great varieties in each class, not\nonly dogs, but forty or fifty kinds of dogs, which no mixture, elevation, decline, or any\nother cause, will ever fabricate; for no clime, art, or chance can give the size of the mastiff\nto the lap dog.\nAssuming that such variations are fixed, he goes on to speculate that \u201cso far from\nall nations being descended of one man, there are many races of men of quite\ndifferent form and attribute\u201d. \u201cTo suppose all races of men descended from one\nparent\u201d, he concludes, \u201cis as absurd as to suppose that an ass may become a horse,\nor an ouran-outan\u201d.77\nSeveral scholars have shown how Pinkerton\u2019s writings reflect wider\ncontemporary interest in articulating and constructing national identities.78\nHowever, what makes him remarkable is that he takes the Scythian\u2013Gothic\nidea, with its implications of common origins, and combines it with explicit\npolygenesis to argue for absolute and unchanging biological distinctions between\ndifferent peoples in Europe. This unorthodox perspective makes it all the\nmore intriguing that versions of this basic thesis\u2014the displacement of Celts by\nmigrating Goths\u2014should be reproduced in mainstream reference encyclopedias\nwell into the nineteenth century. Of course, the encyclopedias are not so openly\nheterodox, but the theory\u2019s dissemination through Pinkerton\u2019s Modern Geography\nlends an underlying ambiguity as to whether, in identifying different groups, the\nencyclopedias are arguing for variations of a single European race or for distinctive\nand separate groups.\n76 Pinkerton, Dissertation, vi\u2013vii.\n77 Pinkerton, \u201cEssay\u201d, xxiv\u2013xxvi; idem, Dissertation, 186, 33.\n78 Gerald Newman, The Rise of English Nationalism: A Cultural History 1740\u20131830, rev. edn\n(London, 1997), 115; Robert Mayhew, Enlightenment Geography: The Political Languages of\nBritish Geography, 1650\u20131850 (New York, 2000), 188\u20139; idem, \u201cBritish Geography\u2019s Republic\nof Letters: Mapping an Imagined Community, 1600\u20131800, Journal of the History of Ideas\n65\/2 (2004), 261\u201373.\n24 paul stock\nThe problem is heightened because Pinkerton\u2019s ideas both confirm and\nunsettle the principle of European racial totality. He argues that one race has\nshaped Europe above all others: the Goths are \u201cthe real foundation of almost\nall European nations\u201d, because the previous Celtic inhabitants were savage. But\nhe also shows how migration and social interaction complicate this apparent\nwholeness. The Dissertation opens with a map entitled \u201cState of the Nations\nat the Christian \u00c6ra\u201d, which roughly depicts the spread of socio-racial groups\nacross Europe, Asia and north Africa.79 No borders are shown\u2014the names merely\nstretch across regions and over each other\u2014providing a complex and imprecise\npicture of Europe\u2019s \u201cracial\u201d identities. The Scythians spread from France to the\nCrimea, and Celts are confined to western France, Switzerland and Ireland.\nThere are also a large number of Iberian and German peoples, but only one\nItalian group; and there are no Europeans further east than the Urals or the\nBlack Sea. It is unclear how this map impacts upon Pinkerton\u2019s wider purpose:\ndoes he intend to group these peoples as Europeans, resolving disparate factions\ninto one composite European identity, or does he privilege the competitive drive\nthat allowed one group to overwhelm others in an ancient struggle for the heart\nof Europe? Perhaps these intentions are not in conflict: in Modern Geography,\nPinkerton constructs a common identity from difference, arguing that shared\n\u201cnature\u201d connects all Germans and all Italians\u2014despite political fragmentation,\nthese peoples are united by intrinsic similarity.80\nBy arguing that Europeans possess a Gothic\u2013Scythian heritage Pinkerton may\nbe continuing this same strategy, arguing that Europe can be considered as a whole\nprecisely because one particular race has rendered it distinct\u2014its unity predicated\non the existence of \u201cothers\u201d, notably Celts and Slavs. However, Pinkerton\ncontinually complicates his own insistence on the centrality of Goths. The\nDissertation describes \u201cthe most prodigious and important [conflict] ever joined\nin Europe\u201d, when Attila\u2019s Huns, joined by Ostrogoths, fought Romans, Visigoths,\nSaxons and other groups. \u201cHad Attila conquered\u201d, Pinkerton speculates, \u201call\nEurope would now have been Hunnish or Turkish, instead of Scythic or Gothic\u201d.81\nDespite attempting to polarize European racial history into a face-off between\nHuns and Turks, and Goths\u2013Scythians, Pinkerton confuses this division, first\nby describing so many groups interacting in Europe, and second by having\nGothic peoples fight on both sides. Goths are both invaders and defenders of\nEurope against alien Huns. This \u201cGothic\u201d Europe is its own \u201cother\u201d, defined by\ngenerations of Gothic\u2013Scythian \u201cnations\u201d competing with each other, as well\nas outsiders and different \u201cEuropeans\u201d (for instance, Celts). The emphasis on\n79 Pinkerton, Dissertation, frontispiece.\n80 Pinkerton, Modern Geography, 1: 591\u20132, 625.\n81 Pinkerton, Dissertation, 196.\n\u201calmost a separate race\u201d 25\nmigration also causes conceptual problems. If, as Modern Geography asserts, Slavs\nand Scythians originated in Asia, then the racial, social and linguistic identities of\nEurope are consequently the result of migrating Asians. Clearly, this complicates\nany racial definition of Europe, suggesting that spatial movement and inhabitancy,\nrather than intrinsic abilities, make one European.82\nPinkerton\u2019s formulation is not the only vision of a divided Europe. Fenning\nand Collyer\u2019s New System of Geography (1765\u20136) investigates how different nations\nbehave according to \u201cManners and Disposition\u201d, a phrase which suggests the\ninterdependency of dispositional and socially acquired differences. For this\nreason, when they discuss \u201cSaxons, Picts and Britons\u201d in ancient England,\nthe distinctions are simultaneously innate (dispositional) and social (related\nto cultural mannerisms).83 The 1747 Complete System also identifies differences\nbetween and within states\u2014Frenchmen, for example, are \u201cbrisk, gay and airy\u201d.\nThe work constructs innate explanations for social differences: it says that the\nBritish are naturally brave, as if Britishness is an ancient trait, extant before the\nstate existed and thus not entirely traceable to social development. Importantly,\nthis assertion connects racial identity with political states, suggesting that\ninhabitants of different state systems are essentially distinct from one another.\nThe System devotes considerable space to formulating complex racial histories,\nmaking differentiations based on complexion and mythological origins (for\nexample, descent from Noah, which might imply the unity of humankind).\nParadoxically, however, the work also stresses the multiplicity of \u201cethnic\u201d groups\nwithin one country: modern Britain, for example, contains Celts, Britons,\nSaxons, Danes, Picts, Irishmen, and Welshmen. Faced with this vast array of\ndifferent peoples, the work makes no categorical distinction between Asians and\nEuropeans: there are so many \u201cracial\u201d groups that it is a hopeless generalization\nto speak of dichotomous Asian or European ethnicities.84\neuropean languages, european races\nThus far this article has demonstrated the complexities of \u201cEurope\u201d as a\nhomogenizing (racial) category in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies. This concluding section will reflect on how the identification of\nmultiple European \u201craces\u201d in the period closely matches the philological\ncategorization of language families.

Indeed, even today theories\nabout early language development are closely related to those concerning human\nphysical evolution, cognitive development, genetic relationships and ancient\nmigratory patterns. The terminology even overlaps: the linguist Steven Roger\nFischer speaks of certain languages as being \u201cgenetically related\u201d.85 According to\nIvan Hannaford, late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century inquiries into the\norigins and classification of humans developed in two directions: comparative\nanatomy and physical anthropology on the one hand, and a search for the\n\u201cfundamentals\u201d of speech and language on the other. William Jones\u2019s linguistic\nstudies cast these related enquiries into a more secular disciplinary framework:\nhe suggested that \u201cthe methods and classification systems developed in physical\nanthropology could be applied to the scientific study of language\u201d.86 In this\nway, some thinkers\u2014Pinkerton among them\u2014sought to establish connections\nbetween language (or philological groups) and \u201ccommunal racial origins\u201d.87\nDiscussing the development of nineteenth-century philology, H. F. Augstein notes\nhow linguistic theories were employed to justify rivalries between ancient races:\nFranks and Gauls in France, Anglo-Saxons and Celts in Britain.88 In the early\n1830s, J. G. Lockhart uses Ernst Ja\u00a8kel\u2019s The Germanic Origin of the Latin Language\nand the Roman Peoples (1831) to identify five \u201craces\u201d or \u201cnations of Christendom\u201d\nin Europe based on language: Celts, Teutons, Sclavonics, Laplanders\/Finns,\nGreeks\/Romans. Celts, for example, can be distinguished by their language\nand dialect: they call themselves \u201cErse\u201d, which signifies not only their language,\nbut also their racial identity.89 Encyclopedias of the late eighteenth and early\nnineteenth centuries also employ philological theory to identify and classify\nEuropeans. The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia says that \u201cthe resemblance of languages\u201d\nindicates the unity of European peoples and that they should cooperate through\npolitical agreement.90 More commonly, however, works identify linguistic\ndivisions in Europe. Mid-eighteenth-century works favour a sixfold partition:\nthe Complete System, Middleton and William Guthrie\u2019s New System of Modern\nGeography all list Greek, Latin, Teutonic, Celtic, Slavonic and Gothic as the\n85 Steven Roger Fischer, A History of Language (London, 1999), 35, 53\u20134, 60.\n86 Hannaford, Race, 241\u20132.

The same terminology is therefore\nused to identify intrinsically distinct human groups and developmental social\ncharacteristics like language. To put it differently, acquired characteristics\nand essentialist ideas about \u201cnature\u201d are seen in terms of one another.\nThe Encyclopaedia Londinensis, for example, defines \u201cEuropean\u201d as both \u201can\ninhabitant\u201d and \u201ca native\u201d of Europe, suggesting that \u201cEuropeanness\u201d is both\nhereditary and socially acquired, both permanent and transitory.93 From\na twenty-first-century perspective, this equation of the acquired and the\ninnate is troubling, since it risks confusing social practice with alleged ethnic\nessentialisms. As this essay has shown, however, such apparent conceptual tension\nis partly a reflection of an eighteenth-century intellectual environment in which\nMaupertuis, Lawrence and others saw social causation and inherited \u201cessence\u201d as\ninseparably, though mysteriously, interdependent. This relationship has its roots\nin theological enquiry, where scriptural exegeses of \u201cracial, national and linguistic\ndivision\u201d were considered to be interrelated and mutually illuminating branches\nof theology and sacred history. Kidd suggests that, as the eighteenth century\ndeveloped, racial discourse gradually became more secularized, but, crucially, it\ncontinued to combine \u201cbiological, climatic and stadialist interpretations of racial\nand cultural difference\u201d.94 In other words, it was possible for environmental or\nsocietal factors to indicate (or even cause) \u201cessential\u201d hereditary characteristics,\nand for innate disposition to define social development.\nThis background explains why it made sense in this period to connect\ndiscussions of \u201crace\u201d with analysis of language. For Prichard, ethnological\ntheories of human variety could be supplemented and refined by linguistic\nstudy: \u201cthe history of languages was the key to the history of the human\nspecies\u201d.95 Pinkerton\u2019s methodology in the Dissertation is also very revealing,\nsince he distinguishes and delineates racial groups (especially Goths from\nCelts and Slavs) according to \u201cidentity of language\u201d, \u201cfamiliar manners\u201d and\n\u201cthe testimony of ancient authors\u201d. Later he claims that \u201clanguage is a most\npermanent matter, not even total revolution in nations can change it . . .

But it also demonstrates that human societal\ndevelopments and essential qualities are, to some extent, defined by one another,\nand that \u201crace\u201d can be extrapolated from language.\nIn this way, Pinkerton\u2019s formulations, despite their unorthodox content, reflect\nlong-standing eighteenth-century problems regarding the understanding and\ncategorization of physical and social differences between humans. However, by\nclosely associating \u201cessential\u201d characteristics with language and other societal\ndevelopments, early racial ideas also potentially legitimize later nineteenth-\ncentury nationalist discourses about the unbridgeable divides between speakers of\ndifferent languages. Maurice Olender notes that by the mid-eighteenth-century\n\u201cit had become impossible to speak of nations or national histories without\ndiscussing the instrument with which they maintained their identity over time\nand conveyed ancestral values from generation to generation: namely language\u201d.97\nCondillac, for instance, identified language with the \u201cgenius\u201d of a people and\nasserted that languages express the character of those who speak them: \u201cLe\ncaracte`re des Peuples influe sur celui des Langues\u201d; \u201cPar cette Histoire des progre`s\ndu langage, chacun peut s\u2019appercevoir que les Langues . . . seroient une peinture\ndu caracte`re & du ge\u00b4nie de chaque peuple\u201d (\u201cthe character of peoples influences\nthat of languages\u201d; \u201cfrom this history of the development of language, everyone\ncan perceive that languages are like a painting of the character and genius of each\npeople\u201d).98 By the later nineteenth century, Olender continues, \u201ccomparative\nphilology frequently neglected history\u201d; it regarded linguistic systems as \u201crigid\nstructures that could not be eroded by time\u201d and through which one could\n\u201cstereotype\u201d civilizations and behaviour. The connection between language and\npermanent human difference culminated in the idea of the \u201clinguistic race\u201d,\nwhere biological categories were identified by language, \u201cintellectual aptitude\u201d\nand \u201cmoral instinct\u201d, rather than by physical features. Ideas about the Indo-\nEuropean language family, for example, would eventually mutate into theories\nabout the \u201cwhite race\u201d. In particular, the search for the non-Hebrew origins of\nEuropean languages would become closely related to anti-Semitic theories about\n96 Pinkerton, Dissertation, xxi, 109.\n97 Maurice Olender, The Languages of Paradise: Race, Religion and Philology in the Nineteenth-\nCentury, trans.

In other words, (national) language and culture could\nidentify \u201cracial\u201d types\u2014that is, unchanging forms of behaviour and appearance\nguaranteed \u201cby the continuity of a lineage\u201d.100\nWhile racial thought in this period thus remains indebted to eighteenth-\ncentury parameters\u2014for example the influence of biblical and classical study\u2014it\neventually leads to later nineteenth-century associations of language, nation\nand biology. This is not an inevitable or straightforward process; after all, the\nScythian\u2013Goth theory could easily legitimize transnational understandings of\nEuropean commonality. However, the texts examined here contain multiple\nimplications: sometimes they argue for a unified European race, and sometimes\nthey detail competing racial groups coexisting in Europe. This unresolved debate\nbroadens the scope for theorizing racial identity in the nineteenth century. It\ncan facilitate a \u201cwhite-man\u2019s-burden\u201d perspective, in which all white-skinned\nEuropeans share a common superiority and purpose. But it can also justify\nEuropean racial rivalry in which particular groups\u2014Teutons, Aryans, Goths\u2014\ndominate inferior European peoples as well as non-Europeans. In this way, early\ndisputes about the \u201cEuropean race\u201d sustain several ideological trajectories. But\nmore widely, they show how eighteenth-century racial inquiry, which combines\ncomplex and diverse ideas about anatomical classification, climate, societal\nanalysis, philology and ancient tradition, can, under certain circumstances,\ncrystallize into the most reductive categorizations.\n99 Olender, The Languages of Paradise, 15\u201316, 57\u201363; idem, \u201cEurope, or How to Escape Babel\u201d,\n5\u20139, 22\u20134.\n100 Thom, Republics, Nations and Tribes, 224\u20137, 266.\n"}
