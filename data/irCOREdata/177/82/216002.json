BOOTH, JOHN W. BUDD, AND KRISTEN M. MUNDAY* \nThe authors analyze youth\u2013adult unionization differences by using the \nNational Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) to follow a single \ngroup of individuals from age 15\/16 to 40\/41. They find that the differences \nbetween youth and adults are greatest at ages 15 to 17 and largely disappear \nby age 23. Though currently unionized workers are most likely to be in \ntheir forties or fifties, the authors find that younger workers have a greater \nopportunity or are more inclined to be unionized than adults and that many \nindividuals report having had a unionized job by the age of 25. The authors also \nfind that whereas the stock of unionized workers is largest at middle age, the \nflow of workers into unionized jobs is greatest between the ages of 16 and 25.\nUnionization patterns for adult workers are believed to differ significantly from \nthose for younger workers. Bryson et al. \n(2005), for example, motivate their study of \nyouth\u2013adult differences in unionization by \nshowing that unionization rates for workers \naged 25\u201365 are three times higher than for \nthose aged 15\u201324 in the United States and \nCanada, and two times higher in Britain. A \nsimilar pattern is evident in New Zealand \nand other countries (Haynes, Vowles, and \nBoxall 2005). Consequently, a number \nof studies specifically examine younger \nworkers\u2019 attitudes towards unions (e.g., \nBlanden and Machin 2003; Freeman and \nDiamond 2003; Gallagher 1999; Gomez, \nGunderson, and Meltz 2002; Lowe and \nRastin 2000; Spilsbury et al. 1987).\nIn comparing youths with adult workers, \nhowever, most studies analyze across \nrather than within cohorts. The statistics \njust noted from Bryson et al. (2005), for \nexample, compare the unionization rates \nfor youths and adults for 1990, 1995, \nand 2000. Cross-sectional comparisons, \nhowever, cannot separate life-cycle effects \nfrom cohort effects (Clark 2007). Unlike \nthose studies, ours asks whether 40-year-\nolds were more likely than 20-year-olds to \nbe represented by unions in 2005 because \nof their age, or because of characteristics, \nattitudes, and experiences specific to the \ncohort of workers who entered the labor \nforce beginning in the 1980s that can be \ndifferent from the characteristics, attitudes, \nand experiences of those who entered 20 \nyears later. Blanchflower (2007) specifically \nraised this question and found that the \ninverted-U age\u2013unionization profiles for \nboth the United States and Britain are \nIndustrial and Labor Relations Review, Vol. 64, No. 1 (October 2010). \u00a9 by Cornell University.\n0019-7939\/00\/6401 $05.00\n* Jonathan E.

In this paper, we investigate \nthis issue further for the United States by \ntracking a single cohort of individuals in \nthe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth \n1979 (NLSY79)from age 15 or 16 in 1979 to \nage 40 or 41 in 2004, uncovering important \nresults for this literature. \nBy tracking individuals from the point \nwhen they initially enter the labor force, \nwe can identify the age at which they first \nbecome unionized and analyze the relative \nprobability of their unionization over the \nfirst half of their working lives. This focus \non a single cohort from the beginning \nof their entrance into the labor market \ninto middle age is a unique approach \nto analyzing individuals\u2019 unionization \ndecisions and generates new results that \nenhance our understanding of youth\u2013\nadult differences in unionization across \nthe life cycle.1 Furthermore, our results, \nwhich demonstrate that most workers first \nexperience unionization at a much younger \nage, may temper the popular impression \nthat unionization is the domain of middle-\naged and older workers. Specifically, for the \ncohort of U.S. individuals who had been \nrepresented by a union by the time they \nwere around 40 years old in 2004, three-\nquarters were first represented by age 25. \nThe stock of unionized workers is largest \nat middle age, but the flow into unionized \njobs is largest at younger ages, and this \nflow appears to be related to completing \none\u2019s education. These results uncover new \nareas of research that can help us better \nunderstand unionization trends, and they \nhave important practical implications for \nhow companies and labor unions can devise \nstrategies for shaping individuals\u2019 attitudes \ntoward unions.\n1 Fullagar, McCoy, and Shull (1992), Clark et al. \n(1993), and Fullagar et al. (1994) analyzed the \nsocialization of new union members in one union, \nbut the experiences analyzed are not necessarily these \nworkers\u2019 first unionized jobs. The mean age in the \nsample used in Clark et al. (1993) and Fullagar et al. \n(1994) is 35 years old; it is 25 years old in Fullagar, \nMcCoy, and Shull (1992). Our sample starts tracking \nindividuals at age 15\/16 to identify workers\u2019 first and \nsubsequent unionized jobs.\nA Life-Cycle                                            \nTheory of Individual Unionization\nMany industrial relations scholars model \nwhether workers are unionized as a function \nof opportunity and propensity (Bain and \nElsheikh 1976; Spilsbury et al. 1987; Blanden \nand Machin 2003). Though this model was \ninitially used as a theoretical foundation \nfor studying aggregate unionization trends \n(Bain and Elsheikh 1976) and has more \nrecently been applied to union-joining \ndecisions in an open shop environment \n(Blanden and Machin 2003), the logic of \nthis model can be extended to the issue \nof union coverage in the U.S. context. \nSpecifically, we model whether an individual \nholds a unionized job, not whether an \nindividual joins a labor union. In the \nUnited States, workers are \u201cunionized\u201d in a \nmeaningful sense when they have jobs that \nare represented by unions and are covered \nby collective bargaining agreements. \nHence, an individual can be unionized \nwithout actually being a union member; \nunion membership is a separate decision. \nDue to a lack of available data on union \nmembership, we concentrate on whether \nworkers are unionized, not whether they \nare union members. Moreover, our focus \nhere is on the outcome (that is, whether a \nworker has a unionized job or not), not on \nthe underlying process of job-seeking, so \nit is not necessary to distinguish between \nthose who intentionally choose a unionized \njob and those who obtain a job that happens \nto be unionized. This is consistent with the \nliterature on U.S. unionization patterns \n(e.g., Blanchflower 2007).\nConsider first a simple model of whether \nan individual i is covered by a union contract \n(or equivalently, represented by a union) at \nage a and time t (Ciat) as a function of the \nworker\u2019s opportunity of being covered (Oi) \nand the worker\u2019s propensity to be covered \n(Pi):\n(1)  Ciat = f (Oi , Pi ) + \u03b5iat  \nwhere \u03b5iat is a random error term that \ncaptures other factors. Opportunity \ncaptures the availability of unionized jobs. \nIndividuals living in areas where union \ndensity is higher, such as in urban areas \nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 798\nor non-right-to-work states, have more \nopportunities to obtain unionized jobs. \nLikewise, for individuals qualified to work \nin industries and occupations with higher \nlevels of union density, the prospects \nfor securing unionized jobs are greater. \nPropensity reflects an individual\u2019s desire for \nunion representation. Pro-union attitudes \nand union instrumentality positively \naffect propensity (Barling, Kelloway, and \nBremermann 1991; Blanden and Machin \n2003); perceived costs of being represented \nby a union negatively affect propensity. \nUnion coverage, alternatively, can be \nmodeled as a function of the supply of and \ndemand for unionized jobs (e.g., Farber \n1983), but these terms frequently focus one\u2019s \nattention on utility-maximizing, pecuniary \nfactors. We therefore prefer to model \nunionization as a function of opportunity \nand propensity while recognizing that the \nsupply of unionized jobs is an important \naspect of opportunity, and that the demand \nfor union representation is an important \naspect of propensity. \nEquation (1) captures a simple age\/time-\ninvariant model of union coverage insofar \nas opportunity and propensity are assumed \nto be fixed for each individual (or each \ncohort). Implicit in the literature on youth\u2013\nadult unionization differences, however, is \na richer life-cycle model of union coverage \nthat incorporates age-varying opportunities \nof coverage and propensities to be covered. \nAlso, if aggregate economic, legal, and \npolitical changes affect opportunity or \npropensity, then a richer model also \nincludes time-varying components. The life-\ncycle model is therefore \n(2)  Ciat = f (Oiat (Lia, Tit  ) Piat  (Lia, Tit  )) + \u03b5iat\nin which opportunity and propensity are \nfunctions of sets of life-cycle age-varying \ncharacteristics (Lia), such as educational \nattainment or changing attitudes towards \nlabor unions, and time-varying aggregate \ntrends (Tit). \nThere are a number of reasons \nto hypothesize that opportunity and \npropensity vary across a worker\u2019s life cycle. \nThe opportunity to obtain a unionized \njob\u2014again, either intentionally or \nunintentionally\u2014can vary over time as \nworkers relocate across geographical areas \nwith differing levels of union density. In \nthe 1990s, employment growth was higher \nin right-to-work states where union density \nwas lower than in non-right-to-work states \n(Wilson 2002), which might have pulled \nindividuals into these areas where the \nchances of having a unionized job were \nlower. A movement across industries and \noccupations by individuals as they age \ncan also affect the opportunity to find a \nunionized job over time. To formalize this, \nwe borrow a concept from the literature on \ninternal labor markets and posit that there \nare ports of entry into unionized sectors \nof the labor market (Kerr 1954; Doeringer \nand Piore 1971). Opportunity can increase \nas workers age if they complete additional \ntraining or schooling and therefore become \nqualified for unionized jobs. Completing \nan apprenticeship program and earning \nteacher certification are two examples. In \nsuch cases, ports of entry into unionized \njobs open up over part of a worker\u2019s \nlife cycle. Alternatively, opportunity can \ndecrease if work experience leads a worker \nup a career ladder away from traditionally-\nunionized jobs; in other words, the ports of \nentry into unionized jobs might close as a \nworker ages. \nPropensity can be hypothesized to vary \nacross the life cycle as well. Attitudes toward \nunions can vary across the life cycle as \nthe context of work changes, such as the \ncosts of quitting, expected job duration, \nand preferences for cash compensation or \nbenefits (Gallagher 1999). How workers \nfirst experience unionization can also \npotentially shape later attitudes towards \nunionization (Lowe and Rastin 2000). \nBryson and Gomez (2003) and Gomez \nand Gunderson (2004) argued, for \nexample, that it is not until an individual is \na union member that he or she can form \nan accurate opinion about whether the \nbenefits of union membership outweigh \nthe costs. The complete understanding of \nwhat being a union member entails is only \nheld by those individuals who are union \nmembers. Grievance procedures, just \ncause protections, and requirements for \nnegotiating rather than imposing work rule \nchanges are some examples of benefits that \nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW799\nunion members receive but which might be \ndifficult for non-unionized workers to fully \nobserve and appreciate. Extending this logic \nto union representation, this \u201cexperience \ngood\u201d model of unionism predicts that \nan individual who is satisfied with union \nrepresentation would want to be represented \nby a union in the future. Complementary \nresearch in psychology reveals that new \nunion members who participate in formal \nand informal socialization activities will \nexhibit greater levels of union commitment \n(Fullagar, McCoy, and Shull 1992; Clark et al. \n1993; Fullagar et al. 1994). Similarly, workers \nwho have what they believe to be a poor \nexperience with union representation are \nmore likely to avoid union representation in \nfuture jobs (Prowse and Prowse 2006).\n The contrast between these age\/time-\ninvariant and life-cycle models of union \ncoverage guides our empirical analyses. \nThe age\/time-invariant model predicts that \ncohort effects explain observed differences \nin unionization rates between youths and \nadults. In contrast, youth\u2013adult differences \nthat reflect life-cycle changes in work and \nattitudes require a richer model in which \nopportunity and propensity to unionize \nvary over the life cycle. At the same time, \nthe life-cycle model reveals the need to \ndistinguish between age and time effects. As \nsuch, the remainder of this paper analyzes \nthe empirical support for the two models, \nincluding what we believe is the first analysis \nof workers\u2019 first experiences with union \nrepresentation, while also trying to separate \nage from time effects. \nData\nTo follow a single cohort of employees \nas they enter the labor force through to \nmiddle age, we use data from the nationally \nrepresentative National Longitudinal \nSurvey of Youth 1979.2 The NLSY79 \ncollected longitudinal demographic and \nlabor market information from the same set \n2 To correct for intentional over-sampling of \ndemographic groups such as minorities and low-income \nhouseholds in the NLSY79, the results throughout this \narticle are computed using sampling weights. For more \ndetails on the sampling methods and data elements of \nthe NLSY79, see Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005).\nof individuals every year from 1979 to 1994, \nand every other year thereafter. All of the \nNLSY79 respondents were between the ages \nof 14 and 22 when first surveyed in 1979, \nbut our analyses focus on the select group \nof individuals who were aged 15 or 16 when \nfirst surveyed.3 This methodology enables \nus to be confident that we are adequately \ncapturing the experiences individuals have \nwith unionization when they first enter the \nlabor force.4 \nEach NLSY79 wave includes information \non up to five jobs for each respondent. We \nexamined the individuals in our cohort of 15- \nand 16-year-olds from 1979 to 2004 across all \nfive jobs and identified all instances at which \neach reported being covered by a collective \nbargaining agreement on at least one job \n(\u201cunionized\u201d). We then created variables \nfor them, indicating for each survey year \n(equivalently, age) whether they are and \nwhether they had ever been unionized. \nThe first instance of ever being unionized \ncaptures workers\u2019 first experience with \nunionization, that is, their first unionized \njob. Some waves of the NLSY79 do not \ncontain information on union membership, \nso we only analyze unionization as measured \nby collective bargaining coverage. This \nfocus on coverage rather than membership \nis common in individual-level research on \nU.S. unionization.\nOf the 3,130 individuals in the NLSY79 \naged 15 or 16 in 1979, we eliminated 1,534 \nbecause we were unable to fully track their \n3 Some waves of the NLSY79 occur in different \nmonths, so not everyone ages exactly one year in the \nreported data. We recode everyone to age one year for \neach survey year based on their age in the initial 1979 \nsurvey.\n4 Because parts of our analyses rely on identifying an \nindividual\u2019s first unionized experience, we cannot be \nconfident that we adequately capture this information \nfor those individuals that begin the survey between the \nages of 17 and 22. The unionization rate for 15-year-\nolds in 1979 is less than 2 percent, compared to a \nrate of between 5 and 10 percent for 17- and 18-year-\nolds. This increase demonstrates that the possibility \nof missing pre-survey unionization is nontrivial for \nthose over the age of 16. Additionally, we exclude \n14-year-olds because they represent a smaller group \nin comparison to 15- and 16 year-olds (the number \nof individuals in each group is 948, 1,566, and 1,564 \nrespectively). Limiting the sample to 15 and 16 year-\nolds enables us to maintain balanced cohort sizes.\nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 800\nunionized status over time due to a lack of \nparticipation in one or more of the 21 waves \nof the survey. Missing values further reduced \nthe final sample size to 1,507 individuals for \nwhom unionization status can be followed \nfrom age 15 or 16 to age 40 or 41.5 To create \na consistent series, individuals were retained \nin the sample when they were not working. \nTable 1 provides summary statistics for the \ndemographic, labor market, and job history \nvariables used in the analyses. Only the first \nand last waves are summarized in Table \n1, but for all 1,507 individuals we have 21 \nwaves of data spanning 26 years. \nThe Cohort Effect in                              \nYouth\u2013Adult Unionization Differences\nYouth\u2013adult differences in unionization \nare frequently analyzed using cross-\nsectional data samples, which do not allow \nfor the identification of a cohort-specific \neffect. Using our sample from the NLSY79, \nhowever, we can trace the unionization rate \nfor one cohort of individuals as they age from \n15\/16 to 40\/41. The resulting age profile of \nthe fraction covered by a union contract is \nindicated by the dashed line in Figure 1.6 \n5 To maintain a decent sample size, we imputed \nvalues for variables where there were missing values \nand where we felt confident we could make the \nimputations. However, 84 individuals were excluded \nbecause missing information existed for which no \nvalue could be determined; five others were excluded \nbecause their starting wage value was less than one \ndollar. The largest set of imputations were made for \na survey error that occurred in 1994, which caused \n621 employed individuals in our final sample to \nnot be asked whether or not they were covered by a \ncollective bargaining agreement on the job. We utilized \ninformation reported for other variables to fill in the \nmissing information\u201489 of these individuals reported \nbeing self-employed and were thus coded as not \ncovered, another 487 were able to be matched based \non their employer identification code to a previous or \nsubsequent year in which the value for their covered \nstatus provided in that year was utilized, 26 individuals \nwere matched in a similar fashion using industry and \noccupation codes, and 19 individuals were coded as not \ncovered because of job tenure of a month or less.\n6 We exclude the ages of 15 and 41 from our figures \nbecause we are only able to observe half our sample \nfor these ages. The age of 15 is only observable for the \ncohort that began the NLSY79 at age 15. Likewise, the \nage of 41 is only observable for the cohort that began \nthe survey at the age of 16. Additionally, because the \nsurvey is only given every other year after 1994, each age \nbetween 31 and 41 alternates between the 15-year-old \nThis profile reveals a steady increase in the \ncoverage rate during the teen years and early \n20s, and then a relatively flat profile for the \nremainder of the sample period up to age \n40. As column 1 of Table 2 illustrates, the \naverage coverage rate for age 15\u201317 is only \n23 percent of the level of the coverage rate \nfor these same individuals when they are 20 \nyears older (that is, 3.7 percent compared \nto 16.2 percent), but this difference is short-\nlived and largely disappears by the time the \nindividuals are 23 years old.  \nTo explore these differences more \nformally, we pooled the 1,507 individuals \nacross the 21 survey waves and estimated \nprobit models on these 31,647 observations \nwith the dependent variable defined as an \nindicator for whether the individuals were \nunionized at a specific age. The probit \nresults reported in column 2 of Table 2 \ndo not include any control variables and \nshow that the average (raw) unionization \nrate for the two youngest age groups are \nindeed statistically different from the oldest \nage group. The union density trend for our \nsingle cohort of individuals, then, uncovers \na significant youth\u2013adult unionization \ndifference, but compared to the cross-\nsectional results from Bryson et al. (2005), \nin which the unionization rate for workers \naged 15\u201324 is only one-third as high as the \nunionization rate for those aged 25\u201365 in \nthe United States, the age-profile in the \nsingle NLSY79 cohort flattens out more \nquickly. Our results are consistent with \nBlanchflower\u2019s (2007) results that also used \nnarrower age categories distinguishing \nbetween teenagers and those in their early \n20s.7 \nColumn 3 of Table 2 presents the results \nand 16-year-old cohorts. To construct the figures, we \ntherefore calculated the unionization rates of interest \nfor each age within each cohort, replaced each missing \nvalue with the average of the previous and subsequent \nvalues within each cohort, and then calculated the \nweighted average of the two rates for each age.\n7 To maintain a balanced panel, the results in \nTable 2 include all individuals, not just those who \nare employed. Excluding those who are not working \nincreases the average union coverage rate by around \n1.8 percentage points in a fairly uniform fashion across \nthe age categories. Consequently, the youth\u2013adult \nunionization differences among the employed are \nquite similar to those reported in Table 2.\nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW801\na The table contains weighted sample means and standard deviations for the years 1979 and 2004.

This model adds demographic \ncontrols to the simple probit model from \ncolumn 2 and therefore accounts for the \nchanging marital status, educational levels, \nand geographical locations of individuals as \nthey age. These changes explain a portion of \nthe difference in unionization between the \nyoungest and oldest ages (compare \u20130.096 \nto \u20130.114 for the age 15\u201319 coefficient), \nbut the overall profile remains similar. \nThe addition of variables that capture the \nchanging industry, occupation, and hours \nof work for individuals\u2019 jobs as they age \n(column 4) further reduces the unionization \ndifferences between teenagers and those \naged 35\u201341 years old. \nAs noted in the model in equation (2), \nhowever, aggregate trends can also be \nimportant determinants of unionization \nrates. The NLSY79 cohort studied here ages \nfrom 15\/16 to 40\/41, from 1979 to 2004. \nThis time period includes three recessions \n(early 1980s, early 1990s, and early 2000s) \nand a 50-percent decline in overall union \ndensity from 27 percent to less than 14 \npercent (Hirsch and Macpherson 2008). As \na result, the workers in this cohort might \nhave fewer opportunities for unionized jobs \nwhen they are older, and the youth\u2013adult \ndifferences estimated in column 4 of Table \n2 might be misleadingly small. The probit \nmodel in column 5, therefore, includes the \nlocal unemployment rate, the annual growth \nin real GDP, and the state unionization \nrate.8 As expected, when we account for \nreduced unionization opportunities at \nolder ages, the youth\u2013adult unionization \ngap widens. The differences between \ncolumns 4 and 5 are modest, however, and \neven with the inclusion of the controls for \naggregate trends, youth\u2013adult unionization \ndifferences mostly disappear by age 23. \nFinally, column 6 of Table 2 reports the \nresults of a random effects probit model \nthat controls for an individual-specific \n8 State-level unionization rates are from Hirsch, \nMacpherson, and Vroman (2001), as updated by those \nauthors on www.unionstats.com. To further control \nfor state-level economic conditions, we also estimated \na model that included state-level probabilities of a \nrecession graciously provided by James Hamilton, but \nthese did not change the results.\neffect, such as unchanging attitudes toward \nunionization, in addition to the controls for \ndemographic, job, and aggregate trends. \nThe predicted unionization difference \nbetween the youngest and oldest age \ngroups is estimated to be \u20130.025, and \u20130.015 \nbetween 18\u201322 year-olds and 35\u201341 year-\nolds. Just as it is in the other specifications, \nthe differences among those who are \nbetween 23 and 41 years old are slight. \nIt should be noted that the break \npoint between 22- and 23-year-olds is \nnot an artifact of our categorizations. \nWe explored alternative specifications \nof the age categories, and the categories \ndisplayed in Table 2 seem to best reflect \nthe unionization differences in the data. \nFor example, changing the endpoint of the \n18\u201322 year-old category to 23 weakens the \nmagnitude of this coefficient while leaving \nthe next older category unchanged in each \nof the specifications in Table 2.9 \nThe results reported in Table 2 imply \nthat though a cohort effect cannot fully \nexplain the youth\u2013adult unionization \ndifferences previously uncovered in cross-\nsectional analyses, a combination of \nperson-specific heterogeneity, aggregate \ntrends, and demographic and especially \njob-related changes over the life cycle can \nexplain approximately 65\u201375 percent of \nthese youth\u2013adult differences (compare \ncolumns 2 and 6). Moreover, these results \ndemonstrate that youth\u2013adult differences \nin unionization are strongest for the very \nyoungest workers (up to age 17), and largely \ndisappear by age 23. These findings are \nimportant because the previous literature \nhas tended to group all youths together \n(e.g., Bryson et al. 2005; Gomez, Gunderson, \nand Meltz 2002), and, in some cases, to use \nan age cut-off for youths of 30 years old \n(Freeman and Diamond 2003; Haynes, \nVowles, and Boxall 2005). We can now \nsee that both approaches mask important \naspects of youth\u2013adult differences in U.S. \nunion coverage rates. \nYouth\u2013adult Differences in Unionized Jobs\n9 Using dummy variables for each age yields similar \nresults. Lastly, a simple switching probit model \nanalogous to Quandt\u2019s (1958) regression switching \nmodel indicates a breakpoint around 22-23 years old.\nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 804\nThe 1,507 individuals in our sample \nbegan 599 unionized jobs between the \nages of 15 and 22 and began 223 unionized \njobs between the ages of 35 and 41. Table \n3 compares the characteristics of these \njobs, excluding those with missing values. \nThese summary statistics complement \nwhat we have uncovered about youth\u2013\nadult differences in unionization rates by \nrevealing how the nature of unionization \nchanges over workers\u2019 life cycles. Unionized \njobs held by younger workers are more likely \nto be held by males, whereas unionized \njobs among adults are gender neutral (the \nfraction female in column 2 mimics the \noverall sample fraction of 0.492). More than \nhalf of the early unionized jobs occur before \nworkers complete their education, while \nthis is rarely the case for later unionized \njobs. Moreover, 71.8 percent of the early \nunionized jobs are these workers\u2019 first \nunionized jobs, compared to only 26 percent \nof the later ones. These last two comparisons \nare unsurprising, but it is useful to document \nthe magnitude of the differences. These \ncontrasts are vivid reminders that youths \nand adults experience unionization in very \ndifferent ways. \nYounger workers are less likely to \nhold unionized jobs in manufacturing, \ntransportation, communication, public \nutilities, and professional services; rather, \nthey are much more likely to experience \nunionization in the wholesale and retail \ntrades, and to a lesser extent, in non-\nprofessional services. Younger workers\u2019 \nunionized jobs are also significantly more \nlikely to be in blue collar, clerical, and \nservice occupations. A significantly higher \nfraction of older workers\u2019 unionized jobs \nare in professional occupations and in the \npublic sector. Though these differences are \npredictable, they have been overlooked in \nthe literature on youth\u2013adult unionization \ndifferences. Unfortunately, we are unable \nto observe attitudinal measures such as job \nsatisfaction, organizational commitment, \nsatisfaction with the union, or union \ncommitment.10 A valuable subject for future \n10 While the NLSY79 contains a measure of job \nsatisfaction, it is not consistently asked for all jobs until \n1994, which means that it is unavailable for many of the \nresearch is whether the differences in how \nyouths and adults experience unionism \naffect these attitudes, and in turn how they \naffect future labor market outcomes.\nThe Age\/Ever-Unionized                        \nProfile Over the Life-Cycle\nTracking a single cohort of individuals \nfrom when they first enter the labor market \nuntil age 40\/41 allows us to examine a \npreviously overlooked issue in the literature \non youth\u2013adult unionization differences: \nthe point at which workers experience \nunionization for the first time in their \nworking lives. To this end, we calculate, on \nan age-by-age basis, the aggregate fraction \nof the individuals in our sample who are \nor were covered by a collective bargaining \nagreement and were therefore represented \nby a labor union. The resulting series reveals \nthe likelihood of having experienced \nunionization by a specific age. This age\/\never-unionized profile for ages 16 to 40 is \nshown by the solid line in Figure 1. The \nnonlinear shape of the age\/ever-unionized \nprofile underscores the life-cycle dynamics \nof unionization, and Figure 1 clearly reveals \nthat workers first experience unionization \nlargely when they are young.11 More than \none-third (35.3 percent) of the sample had \nat least one unionized job by age 22, and \nnearly half (49.3 percent) experienced \nunionization by age 25. Among those who \nwere unionized by age 40, 76.5 percent first \nexperienced unionization by age 25.\nThe flattening of the age\/ever-unionized \nprofile after age 35 in Figure 1 further \nsuggests that if a worker has not been \nrepresented by a union by age 40, it is \nvery unlikely that the worker will ever be \nunionized. To investigate this further, we \nestimated a three-parameter exponential \nmodel of the form ever-unionized = \u03b20+ \u03b21* \n\u03b22\nage on the data plotted in Figure 1 using \nnonlinear least squares. The resulting \nmodel has an adjusted R2 value of 0.996, and \nunionized jobs analyzed here.\n11 Figure 1 also shows that 64 percent of the \nindividuals in this cohort are unionized at least once \nin their working lives by age 40. Across the life cycle, \nthen, U.S. labor unions represent many more workers \nthan is suggested by the conventional union density \nstatistic of less than 15 percent. \nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW805\nContinued\n  Ages 15-22 \n(1) \nAges 35-41 \n(2) \nAge 19.278 \n(1.820) \n37.586** \n(1.866) \nFemale \n \n0.390 \n(0.496) \n0.487** \n(0.497) \nNonwhite \n \n0.326 \n(0.499) \n0.354 \n(0.492) \nMarried \n \n0.130 \n(0.335) \n0.602** \n(0.501) \nHigh School Not Complete 0.333 \n(0.461) \n0.068** \n(0.251) \nHigh School Graduate  0.463 \n(0.500) \n0.454 \n(0.497) \nSome College  \n \n0.186 \n(0.400) \n0.193 \n(0.419) \nCollege Graduate  0.018 \n(0.143) \n0.285** \n(0.445) \nSchooling Completed at the Time of the Job 0.415 \n(0.497) \n0.968** \n(0.204) \nLived in an Urban Area 0.832 \n(0.357) \n0.754 \n(0.399) \nLived in a Right-to-Work State 0.265 \n(0.451) \n0.318** \n(0.489) \nNumber of Prior Jobs 3.641 \n(2.766) \n13.855** \n(6.306) \nFirst Unionized Job 0.718 \n(0.458) \n0.260** \n(0.422) \nIndustry   \nManufacturing 0.195 \n(0.387) \n0.143* \n(0.342) \nTransportation, Communication, and Public \nUtilities \n0.052 \n(0.223) \n0.125** \n(0.331) \nWholesale and Retail Trade 0.367 \n(0.470) \n0.147** \n(0.337) \nProfessional and Related Services 0.108 \n(0.352) \n0.361** \n(0.485) \nOther Services (Business, Repair, Personal, \nEntertainment, or Recreation) \n0.106 \n(0.313) \n0.037** \n(0.224) \n  \nTable 3.

Specifically, the age\/time-\ninvariant model implies that each worker \nfaces a fixed probability of being unionized \nat each age. If this model is accurate, then \nwe should be able to generate an age\/ever-\nunionized profile that matches the actual \nprofile in Figure 1 by using simulated data \nand a fixed probability of being unionized. \nMoreover, we can assess youth\u2013adult \ndifferences in the receptivity to unionization \nby analyzing the extent to which the baseline \nmodel of a fixed probability of being \nunionized over time needs to be modified \nto fit the actual data. \nWe therefore constructed an artificial \ndata set of 1,500 individuals spanning ages \n16 to 40, analogous to the actual sample \nused in Figure 1. We randomly determined \neach artificial individual\u2019s union status \nat each age, based on a fixed probability. \nFrom this, we calculated each individual\u2019s \nage of first unionization and generated \nthe aggregate age\/ever-unionized profile \nacross the 1,500 individuals. We repeated \nthis simulation 100 times for the same \nprobability level and constructed the \naverage age\/ever-unionized profile. We also \nrepeated this simulation method for each \nfixed probability level from 0.01 to 0.20 in \n0.01 increments. Recall that we are looking \nfor a fixed probability level that replicates \nthe actual age\/ever-unionized profile. \nNone of the resulting 20 simulated profiles, \nhowever, match the actual NLSY79 profile \nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW807\nFigure 1.

The simulated age\/ever-\nunionized profiles generated from these two \nprobability levels come closest to matching \nthe actual age\/ever-unionized profiles, but \nthey lack sufficient curvature to accurately \nreplicate the actual profile. Each of the \nother fixed-probability simulations over-\npredict or underpredict to a greater extent. \nThese results, therefore, do not support an \nage\/time-invariant model of unionization.\nTo replicate the actual NLSY79 profile, \nwe need instead to adjust the probability \nof unionization at different age levels \nconsistent with a life-cycle model of \nunionization. In Panel (c), we illustrate \nthe simulated profile using the actual \nage-by-age union coverage rates from the \nNLSY79 (that is, the dashed line in Figure \n1). This simulation grossly overstates the \nactual pattern of first unionization. So, it \nis clearly not the case that the decision to \nunionize mimics a random draw from the \npool of unionized and non-union jobs at \neach age.

Comparing Actual and Simulated Age\/Ever-Unionized Profiles\nby deflating the actual age-by-age coverage \nrates by a factor of two for ages 20\u201324, a \nfactor of five for ages 25\u201330, and a factor of \nseven for ages 31\u201340. We stress here that we \nare able to replicate the actual profile only \nby significantly decreasing the probability \nof unionization as workers become older. \nDoing so provides empirical support for a \nlife-cycle model of unionization in which \nthe combined effects of opportunity and \npropensity decrease as workers age. This is \nan intriguing result since the literature on \nyouth\u2013adult differences is often motivated \nby an observation that younger workers \nare less likely to be unionized than older \nworkers.\nOne can question whether these results \nare being driven by measurement error. \nYounger workers, in particular, might \nnot pay attention to whether their job is \nunionized or not and might, therefore, not \naccurately report their true union status \nwhen surveyed. However, under-reporting \nof unionization increases the number of \nworkers truly exposed to unionization at \nan early age, and only very high levels of \nover-reporting of union coverage with no \noffsetting under-reporting significantly \nreduces the ever-unionized rate over the \nlife cycle (see the Appendix). The age\/\never-unionized profile results therefore \nappear to be robust to reasonable levels of \nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW809\nmeasurement error. The results from Table \n2 further suggest that changing aggregate \ntrends are not driving the results; rather, it \nappears that the interaction of opportunity \nand propensity for unionized employment \ndeclines as workers age.\nYouth\u2013adult Flows into Unionized Jobs\nThe results presented here portray an \ninteresting contrast. On the one hand, age-\nby-age union coverage rates reinforce what \nother research has found: the probability of \nbeing unionized increases as workers grow \nfrom teenagers into adulthood. On the other \nhand, the shape of the age\/ever-unionized \nprofile suggests that the combined effect \nof opportunity and propensity decreases as \nworkers transition from youth to adulthood. \nThis contrast indicates that it is important \nto distinguish between the stock and flow of \nunionized workers. Coverage rates reflect \nthe stock of unionized workers at a certain \nage whereas the age\/ever-unionized profile \ncaptures the flow of workers into unionized \njobs for the first time. \nTo explicitly analyze the flow into union \njobs, we identified all instances of new jobs \nreported by the workers in our sample. For \nworkers between the ages of 16 and 25, there \nare on average 0.063 new unionized jobs per \nworker per year. For workers between the \nages of 32 and 41, this average falls to 0.022. \nIn other words, the flow into new union jobs \nis three times greater for younger workers \nthan it is for adult workers. This result might \nseem obvious\u2014workers are ostensibly more \nlikely to move into unionized jobs when they \nare younger because they are more likely to \nmove into new jobs generally\u2014but consider \na comparison between the flow rates into \nunionized and nonunion jobs. Our sample \nsuggests that these flow rates are quite \nsimilar for workers of the same age\u2014the \nflow into new nonunion jobs is also three \ntimes greater for ages 16\u201325 compared to \n32\u201341 (0.636 versus 0.209). In other words, \nthe ratio of new union to nonunion jobs is \nrelatively stable across these age ranges\u2014\nthere are 10.2 new nonunion jobs for each \nnew unionized job when the individuals \nare aged 16\u201325, and 9.6 new nonunion \njobs for each new unionized job when the \nindividuals are aged 32\u201341.\nThe contrast between the stock and \nflow of unionized workers across the life \ncycle implies that researchers should seek \nto supplement our understanding of the \nyouth\u2013adult differences in the stock of \nunionized workers with a greater insight \ninto the flow process into unionized jobs \nover the life cycle. Part of this should be \nan understanding of the flow into workers\u2019 \nfirst unionized jobs. To this end, Figure 3 \npresents the age-by-age first unionization \nrates for the sample of 992 individuals, \nfor which we identified an instance of \nunionization by age 40\/41. Panel (a) shows \nthat the highest rates of first unionization \noccur in the age range of 16 to 25 years \nold. First unionization rates for workers 30 \nyears old and older are significantly lower \nand are always less than three percent. The \ntwo peaks in Panel (a) coincide with the \ntypical age of graduation from high school \nand college, and therefore beg questions \nabout the extent to which flows into first \nunionization experiences are related to \ncompleting one\u2019s education and entering \nthe workforce on a full-time basis. \nPanel (b) of Figure 3 addresses this issue \nby presenting the first experience rates for \nthe five years prior to the completion of \nschooling and the 10 years after. This figure \ndistinguishes between high school dropouts \nand all others and uses each individual\u2019s \nfinal education level at age 40\/41. High \nschool dropouts are likely to first experience \nunionization at any time. But for all others, \nthe first unionization rate peaks when they \nfinish their schooling and remains relatively \nhigh for a few more years. In other words, \nfor those who graduate from high school \nand possibly continue their education \nbeyond high school, a significant portion \nof the flows into the unionized sector, \ntherefore, appears related to the transition \nfrom school to the full-time, career-oriented \nlabor force. This result suggests a unionized \nsector characterized by ports of entry in \nwhich schooling is tied to qualifications for \nunionized jobs. \nTo analyze this result further, we ask \nwhether we can predict when someone \nwho is unionized at some point between \nage 15\/16 and 40\/41 becomes unionized \nfor the first time. One can consider \nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 810\nSource: NLSY79 data for 1979\u20132004 of individuals who were 15 or 16 years old in 1979 and who were unionized at some \npoint between age 15\/15 and 40\/41.\nFigure 3.

Table 4 presents the \nresults of estimating the widely-used Cox \nproportional hazards model.12 Consistent \nwith Figure 3b, we present separate estimates \nfor high school dropouts and non-dropouts. \nIn Table 4, hazard ratios above one indicate \nthat increases in the relevant independent \nvariable are associated with an increased \nlikelihood of becoming first unionized \nin the next time period; ratios below one \nindicate the opposite. \nThe results for those who have, at a \nminimum, completed high school are \npresented in columns 1\u20133 of Table 4. For the \ncompleted schooling variables, the omitted \nreference category consists of the ages when \nindividuals are within one year of completing \ntheir schooling. In all three specifications, \nthe completed schooling variables are less \nthan one, indicating that individuals are \nmost likely to become unionized first around \nthe time they complete their schooling. \nWhen controlling for demographic \ncharacteristics and aggregate trends \n(column 2), the post-completed schooling \nestimates are not statistically significant, \nand none of the estimates are significant \nwhen job characteristics are included in the \nmodel (column 3).

Specifically, the \npeak likelihood of becoming unionized \nfor the first time occurs 5\u20137 years after \ndropping out of school. For the most part, \nthe estimates in columns 4\u20136 are quite \nimprecisely estimated, indicating that \nthere is little relationship between the time \nwhen someone drops out of school and \nwhen one enters the unionized sector. This \nimprecision could also reflect the very small \nsample size; firmer conclusions require \nadditional research. \nConclusions\nYouth\u2013adult differences in unionization \nis an important research topic for \nunderstanding individual unionization \ndecisions, labor market and career issues \nover the life cycle, the composition of the \nlabor movement, and prospects for the \nlabor movement\u2019s future. We have analyzed \nyouth\u2013adult differences by tracking a \nsingle, nationally representative cohort \nof 1,507 individuals in the NLSY79 from \nwhen they enter the labor market at age \n15\/16 until they reach age 40\/41. Even \nwithin a single cohort, there are significant \ndifferences in unionization rates between \nyouths and adults, so a cohort effect cannot \nfully explain the youth\u2013adult unionization \ndifferences found in cross-sectional analyses \nin the existing research literature. A mixture \nof person-specific heterogeneity, aggregate \ntrends, and demographic and job-related \nchanges over the first half of workers\u2019 life \ncycles can explain more than three-quarters \nof the raw differential in union coverage \nbetween those aged 15\u201317 and 35\u201341, and \nnearly two-thirds of the difference for those \naged 18\u201322. \nMore importantly, we find that these \ndifferences are strongest for the very \nyoungest workers (ages 15\u201317) and largely \ndisappear by age 23. Researchers therefore \nneed to pay careful attention to the \ndefinition of youth when examining youth\u2013\nadult unionization differences.

Our results show that in the \nUnited States this grouping would mask the \ndifferences between workers who are under \nage 22 and those who are older, and would \ntherefore not be appropriate for research \non U.S. unionization. Even the research that \ngroups all youths together up to age 24 (e.g., \nBryson et al. 2005; Gomez, Gunderson, \nand Meltz 2002) might unintentionally be \nmasking important contrasts between the \nyounger and older youths. \nBy tracking a young cohort of individuals \nfor 25 years, we have uncovered additional \nlife cycle features of how U.S. workers \nexperience unionization. Whereas currently \nunionized workers are likely to be in their \n40s or 50s, individuals\u2019 first unionized jobs \noccur much earlier. In the cohort analyzed \nhere, nearly half report having had a \nunionized job by age 25. This translates to \nthree-quarters of all individuals who are \nunionized at least once by age 40\/41. In \nother words, there are probably few late \nbloomers in the U.S. labor movement. \nOur simulation results further imply that \nthe combined effect of opportunity and \npropensity for unionized jobs is lower, not \nhigher, among older workers. Even though \nwe are cannot directly measure individuals\u2019 \nattitudes towards unions, these results \nimplicitly reinforce others\u2019 findings that \nyounger workers are not less receptive to \nunions than older workers (Freeman and \nDiamond 2003; Gomez, Gunderson, Meltz \n2002). \nOne seemingly sensible hypothesis about \nyounger workers\u2019 attitudes toward unions is \nthat in high school, everyone ostensibly has \nthe opportunity to obtain a unionized job as \nan adult by choosing a career path that leads \nto being a teacher, a nurse, or some other \nhighly unionized occupation. But these \nopportunities apparently decline as workers \nage, perhaps because ports of entry into \nunionized jobs are most readily accessible \nwhen workers complete their schooling and \nbegin their full-time careers. Reconciling \nthese declining opportunities with the fact \nthat union coverage rates are higher among \nolder workers requires distinguishing \nbetween the stock and flow of unionized \nworkers. Part of this is a measurement issue: \nolder workers have longer job durations, so \na cross-sectional estimate of union density \nat a point in time will capture a higher \nfraction of unionized workers among older \nrather than younger workers.13 But it might \nbe more than a measurement issue: in the \ncohort analyzed here, the flow into both \nunion and nonunion jobs among workers \naged 32\u201341 is only one-third that of workers \naged 16\u201325. So while the stock of unionized \nworkers is largest at middle age, the flow \ninto unionized jobs is largest at younger \nages. Future research should investigate \nfurther how and why the flow of workers \ninto and out of unionized employment \nvaries over the life cycle. \nOur study of youth\u2013adult differences \nin unionization not only brings to light \nimportant research issues for understanding \nbetter how workers experience unionization \nover the life cycle, but it also has significant \npractical implications. Managers in \nnonunion companies use preventive labor \nrelations tactics to try to remain \u201cunion-\nfree.\u201d At the same time, union organizers \nuse various strategies for recruiting new \nmembers. In the political arena, business \ngroups and labor federations frequently \nvie for the public\u2019s support. Based on an \naggregate union density rate of less than \n15 percent, all of these strategies might \nfrequently be premised on the assumption \nthat the targeted individuals have not had \nany direct experience with unionization. \nBut our results suggest that a majority of \nindividuals are in a unionized job at some \npoint in their working lives, and thus, \nstrategies to affect workers\u2019 support for or \nagainst labor unions should be developed \naccordingly.\nMoreover, both companies and unions \nshould understand that many workers first \nexperience unionization at a young age, \nwhich provides these organizations with the \nopportunity to shape individuals\u2019 attitudes \n13 This is analogous to the fact that a survey of the \nunemployed is more likely to sample individuals with \nlonger spells of unemployment (Salant 1977).\nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 814\ntoward unions\u2014attitudes that might persist \neven after they are no longer in unionized \njobs. Labor unions, for example, should \nguard against creating negative attitudes \namong young workers who might feel \nneglected by their unions because this \nmight affect their support for union or \nunion-endorsed political causes later on in \ntheir lives. In other words, unions should \ndevise life-cycle rather than membership-\ncentric models of representation (Kochan \n2005). Our results also suggest that \nlower unionization rates among youths \nas compared to adult workers are largely \na function of their job characteristics. \nTherefore, unions should not assume that \nyouths are unreceptive to unionization \nand should make special efforts to reach \nout to them in their workplaces (Johnson \nand Jarley 2005). Lastly, to the extent that \nworkers become unionized as part of the \nprocess of completing their education, \nunions would benefit from being an \nexplicit part of this process. Academics and \nindustrial relations practitioners alike, then, \ncan benefit from a deeper understanding of \nworkers\u2019 experiences with unionization over \ntheir life cycles.\nAppendix: Measurement Error\nTo investigate measurement error in \nthe union coverage variable, the NLSY79 \nunionization rates could be compared to \nthose in another data source such as the \nCurrent Population Survey. But the NLSY79 \nand these other data sources use similar \nsurvey methods, so there is little basis \nfor assuming that the unionization rates \nreported in other surveys are any more or \nless accurate than the NLSY79. And so we \ntake a different approach and ask what the \ntrue age\/ever-unionized profile would look \nlike if the observed NLSY79 profile reflected \na certain level of misclassification of workers\u2019 \ntrue union status at each age. Simulations \ncan answer this question. Specifically, we \nstart with the reported union status values \nfor each individual at each age in our data \nset and then assume that a percentage of \nindividuals over- or under-reported their \ntrue union status at that age. We then \nsimulate the true union status by randomly \nre-coding the relevant percentage of \nindividuals and then generate the resulting \nage\/ever-unionized profile. Note that we \ndo not simulate the age\/ever-unionized \nprofile directly; we simulate age-by-age \nunion coverage status and then derive the \nimplied age\/ever-unionized profile. \nAppendix Figure A presents the results \nof some of our simulations. As in Figure 2, \nAppendix Figure A includes the NLSY79 \nage\/ever-unionized profile (with the 95 \npercent confidence interval as dashed \nlines) and the average simulated profiles \nfrom 100 simulations. Note first that with \nmany more nonunion than unionized \nworkers at any given age, if there are \nsymmetrical error rates (that is, roughly \nequal rates of over- and under-reporting) \nthen many more workers are misclassified \nas nonunion than as union, so the NLSY79 \nage\/ever-unionized profile in Figure 1 is \nbiased downwards (that is, more individuals \nactually experience unionization earlier \nthan suggested in Figure 1). This is \nillustrated in Panel (a) of Appendix Figure \nA in which the simulated \u201ctrue\u201d profile is \nsignificantly above the actual profile even \nwhen we assume that only 5 percent of \nworkers coded as nonunion are actually \nworking in unionized jobs compared to 20 \npercent of reportedly-unionized workers \nerroneously stating that they are unionized \nwhen they are actually nonunion. \nPanels (b)\u2013(d) in Appendix Figure A \nassume that no workers under-report their \ntrue union status (that is, all nonunion \nresponses are accurate) and vary the rates \nof union over-reporting. In Panel (b), we \nassume that 20 percent of union responses \nare inaccurate at each age, and the resulting \n\u201ctrue\u201d profile is slightly below the 95 percent \nconfidence interval for the profile estimated \nin our data. Panel (c) shows the results of \nwhat we think is an extreme scenario\u201450 \npercent over-reporting of union status \n(and again, no under-reporting). Even \nin this scenario, the general shape of the \nprofile is preserved, 51 percent of workers \nare unionized at least once by age 40, and \nthe average age of first unionization is 24 \nyears. In Panel (d), ignorance is assumed to \ndecrease with age with the following over-\nreporting rates for union status: 50 percent \nfor ages 15\u201322, 25 percent for ages 23\u201326, \nINDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW815\nand 15 percent for ages 27 and above. The \nlevel of the first exposure rates at each age \nis reduced, but the general trajectory of the \nprofile is unchanged. Based on these results, \nincluding other simulations with different \nvalues for the over-reporting rate that yield \nsimilar results, we do not believe that the \nshape of the age\/ever-union profile is an \nartifact of measurement error.\nAppendix Figure A\nAge\/Ever-Unionized Profiles with Measurement Error\nSource: NLSY79 data for 1979--2004 of individuals who were 15 or 16 years old in 1979 and who were \nunionized at some point between age 15\/16 and 40\/41.\na) \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 20 25 30 35 40\nAge\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n \nNLSY79\nSimulated \"true\" prole if  NLSY79 \nhas 20% union over-reporting and\n5% under-reporting \n \nb) \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 20 25 30 35 40\nAge\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n \nNLSY79\nSimulated \"true\" prole \nif NLSY79 has 20% \nunion over-reporting\n \nc) \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 20 25 30 35 40\nAge\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n \nNLSY79\nSimulated \"true\" prole \nif NLSY79 has 50% \nunion over-reporting\n \nd) \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n15 20 25 30 35 40\nAge\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n \nNLSY79\nSimulated \"true\" prole \nif  NLSY79 has 15-50% \nunion over-reporting \ndependent on age\n \n \n \nFIRST-TIMERS AND LATE-BLOOMERS 816\nBain, George S., and Farouk Elsheikh. 1976.
