This includes the assessment of agriculture, water resources,\nbiodiversity and coastal and river flooding. The tool arose from the need to further develop\nthe methods applied in the earlier RegIS project, which was the first local to regional\nintegrated assessment in the UK. The limitations of RegIS, included very long run times, a\nlimited number of simulations, incomplete linkages between models and no allowance for\nscenario uncertainty. Based upon the stakeholder needs identified within RegIS, a series of\nguiding principles were developed with Steering Committee stakeholders, which informed the\nconcept of the \u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019 including functionality, appearance and\ncomplexity. An Integrated Assessment Methodology based upon the Drivers-Pressure-State-\nImpact-Response (DPSIR) framework facilitated the integration of multiple models, scenarios\nand datasets within the software interface. The development of the \u2018Regional Impact\nSimulator\u2019 provides a test-bed for further studies of stakeholder-led, regional, integrated\nassessment, and provides an opportunity to learn the many lessons in undertaking such\nstudies.\n1. Introduction\nThe impacts of predicted changes in climate (e.g. Hulme et al., 2002) due to human emissions\nof greenhouse gases (IPCC 2007) will be in addition to or concurrent with those associated\nwith continuing socio-economic and political change (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000). An\nholistic or integrated assessment of the effects of our changing future is therefore needed.\nIntegrated assessment (IA) has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange as \u201can interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets, and communicates\n3knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines from the natural and social sciences to\ninvestigate and understand causal relationships within and between complicated systems\u201d\n(IPCC, 2001).\nIt is fundamental to this definition that there are two main principles to integrated assessment:\n(1) integration over a range of relevant disciplines; and (2) the provision of new and\nappropriate information about how complex real-world systems might behave that enables or\nimproves decision making (Harremoes and Turner, 2001; Jones, 2001; Yarnal, 1998).\nDepartment for Environment, Transport and the Regions - DETR (2000, p 138) assert that the\nregional (sub-national) scale studies are most relevant to decision-making, a view supported\nby Dessai and Hulme (2004) and Turnpenny et al., (2004). This is why the high level of\nspatial aggregation of many integrated assessment models and analyses (e.g. Dowlatabadi,\n1995; Nordhaus and Yang, 1996; Alcamo et al., 1998; Parry et al., 1999; Tyson et al., 2001;\nMatsuoka et al., 2001; Toth, 2003) designed for climate policy at national or continental\nscales are inappropriate for many stakeholders who are operating at, or have responsibility for\nimplementation of climate change adaptation policy at the local or regional level (Shackley\nand Deanwood 2002.\nWithin Europe, two of the potentially most far-reaching pieces of policy or legislation\naffecting landscape management are the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the rural\ndevelopment reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Both are intended to deliver\nenvironmental, rather than economic, benefits and represent paradigm shifts in policy\ndirection, from \u201cend of pipe\u201d to holistic solutions. This means river basin-based solutions to\nwater quality problems under the WFD, whilst the CAP reform shifts the focus of agriculture\naway from solely food production to the delivery of additional services (e.g. environmental\nbenefits, flood management etc). The importance of these policy changes and the relatively\nshort period over which such paradigms shifts can occur demonstrates the real need for local\nto regional-based Integrated Assessments that address the environmental, rather than\n4economic, impacts of change resulting not just from climate but also from socio-economic\nand policy change.\nThe application of downscaled socio-economic data to any scale of global change studies is\nonly in the early stages (e.g. Arnell et al., 2004; Parry et al., 2004). As a result, few studies\ndescribe the results of regional (sub-national) scale assessments (e.g.; Rosenberg 1993,\nYarnal, 1998; Yohe et al., 1999; Fisher, 2000; Strzepek et al., 2001; Carmichael et al., 2004;\nHolman et al., 2005 a & b). Of these, RegIS (Holman et al., 2005 a & b) was one of the few\nassessments to consider the effects of both socio-economic and policy change.\nThe \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West\nEngland\u2019 (RegIS) study (Holman et al, 2005 a & b) developed a stakeholder-led methodology\nfor regional climate change impact assessment that explicitly evaluated local and regional\n(sub-national) scale impacts and adaptation options, and cross-sectoral interactions between\nfour major sectors driving landscape change (agriculture, biodiversity, coasts \/ floodplains\nand water resources). At the end of the RegIS project, the UK Climate Impacts Programme\n(UKCIP) hosted a technical workshop for stakeholders to discuss the project results and to\nreflect on the lessons learnt. Key issues for future stakeholder-led Integrated Assessments\ncame out of this workshop, as stakeholders wanted:\n\uf0b7 simulations for more than two climate and two socio-economic scenarios and one\nfuture 30-year time-slice (the 2050s)\n\uf0b7 Better understanding of the assumptions and effects of uncertainty within the climate\nand socio-economic scenarios;\n\uf0b7 The ability to conduct sensitivity analysis to be able to better understand the effects of\nmultiple interactions on impacts;\n\uf0b7 More interactions between the drivers of change, the impacts, feedbacks and adaptive\nresponses.\n5It was axiomatic from these key issues that stakeholders desired to be able to perform their\nown integrated assessment- investigating the impacts and adaptive responses of relevance to\nthemselves, rather than having to rely on the restricted outputs generated from a limited\nnumber of simulations chosen arbitrarily by researchers. However, stakeholder involvement\nis discouraged by the unacceptably long runtimes of most existing models (Wolfe et al.,\n2001). In an attempt to overcome these difficulties and make the RegIS methodology\navailable to a wide stakeholder community of policy advisors, the two-year RegIS2 study\n(Holman and de Vries, 2005) was born- its aim being to develop the use of computationally\nsimpler modelling techniques, so called \u2018metamodels\u2019 or \u2018reduced form models\u2019 (Carmichael\net al., 2004), within a user friendly interface .\n2. Selection of the study areas\nIt has been argued that for the results of a participatory IA to have relevance, the region being\nmodelled must have some political relevance or influence (Carmichael et al 2004), but this\nplaces unequal weight on policy analysis at the expense of the public discussion purpose of\nparticipatory IA methods (Alcamo et al., 1996; van Asselt and Rijkens-Klomp 2002).\nHowever, while this approach recognises that (endogenous) regional processes may be\ninfluenced by (exogenous) global or supra-national factors, it fails to demonstrate the\ndiffering sensitivity and vulnerability of different regions to these factors.\nThe Regional Impact Simulator aims to improve the understanding of local\/regional impacts\nof global change for a wide range of stakeholder audiences, and thereby to aid public\ndiscussion. In a climatically, physiographically and economically diverse country such as the\nUnited Kingdom, this was felt to be best supported by allowing the User to explore\n6consequences in two contrasting regions (Table 1), rather than a single area. By capturing a\nsignificant range of the heterogeneity of the UK, it was intended that this would result in a\ngeneric methodology and also allow users to extrapolate their findings and understanding to\nother regions.\nThe North West is the larger of the two regions. It is dominated by higher land (up to about\n900 m above sea level (masl)) in the north and along its eastern boundary; lower land is found\nin the west and south of the region. The proximity of the North Atlantic provides a\nmoderating influence on climate, producing generally milder and wetter weather (average\nannual rainfall = 650 - 3200 mm). The climate of East Anglia is influenced by its low relief\n(most land is below 60 masl) and its proximity to the continental land mass of Europe. It is\nless affected by the moderating influence of the sea, so rainfall (average annual rainfall = 550\n- 750 mm) is lower and there is a greater daily and monthly temperature range than elsewhere\nin the UK.\n3. Methodological context\nRegIS (Holman et al., 2005a) demonstrated that the development of a robust, transparent and\ntransportable methodology to assess regional climate change impacts across sectors is not a\ntrivial task. Building upon stakeholder input within RegIS (described in Holman et al.,\n2005a) was fundamental to delivering a software interface (the \u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019)\nwith simpler \u2018metamodels\u2019 to reach a wider stakeholder community. The inclusion and\nparticipation of stakeholders is vital in decisions that account for future change. Their\nspecialised and practical knowledge is needed to evaluate adaptation options (Dessai and\nHulme, 2004). To maximise the utility of the software interface, stakeholders gave their input\non:\n7\uf0b7 definitions of the components of the underpinning Integrated Assessment\nMethodology (IAM)\n\uf0b7 design elements\n\uf0b7 usefulness of output indicators for each of the metamodels;\n\uf0b7 appropriateness of the regional adaptive responses;\n\uf0b7 functionality of the interface\nUnderlying the advice and discussion regarding the development of the Regional Impact\nSimulator were the dilemma that a generic tool aimed at a wide range of stakeholder\naudiences should:\n\uf0b7 raise awareness of the implications of policy decisions, but that it should not be used to\n\u2018test\u2019 specific detailed cases;\n\uf0b7 familiarize people with the drivers, pressures, impacts and response options but that it\ncannot be detailed enough to meet the specific requirements and expectations of\neveryone;\n\uf0b7 familiarize people with the assumptions and uncertainties involved in integrated\nassessments which prevent \u201cprediction\u201d or \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the future;\n\uf0b7 should be a tool for communicating and aiding public discussion but that it alone is no\nguarantee that people will agree or that their decisions are \u201cbest\u201d; it cannot overcome the\nfact that individuals will interpret things differently, such as the drivers, pressures,\nimpacts and response options to change.\nThese are discussed further in the proceeding sections\n3.1 RegIS2 Integrated Assessment Methodology\nThe assessment framework was based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (or\nDPSIR) framework, which was first proposed by OECD (1993) and has been widely used in\nenvironmental management for the last 10 years, (e.g., Turner et al., 1998; La Jeunesse et al.,\n82003; Holman et al., 2005a). It is a useful conceptual model for promoting dialogue between\nthe different disciplines that must work together to solve complex environmental problems. It\nhas been adopted by government agencies such as the England and Wales Environment\nAgency and the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2003).\nThere is also increasing demand for more integrated assessment of environmental change,\nwhich translates into a need to develop formal integrated assessment models. However, even\nwhen used in a conceptual role, important differences of opinion can arise as to what \u201cdriver\u201d,\n\u201cpressure\u201d, etc mean and hinders more widespread application of the framework. When the\nDPSIR framework is used as the basis for models, the differences of interpretation have to be\nresolved and a consensus developed across the model developers and users, and ideally much\nmore widely.\nThe agreed foci and methodological approaches of the DPSIR domains used in RegIS2\n(Figure 1) for conducting an integrated climate change impact assessment are given below.\nDrivers:\nDefinition: Causes of environmental change which are exogenous to the region, e.g. climate\nand socio-economic change, national and international (EU) policy.\nMethod: identify and describe qualitative, narrative storylines for several plausible future\nscenarios, e.g. based on the IPCC-SRES framework.\nExamples:\n\uf0b7 Coasts - Social change, economic change, climate change (sea level, storms,\ntemperature);\n\uf0b7 Agriculture- Social change (consumer preferences), climate change, economic change\n(supply & demand), EU & international policy change;\n\uf0b7 Biodiversity - Climate change, environmental consciousness, concern for\nenvironmental sustainability, European nature conservation policy, recreation trends;\n9\uf0b7 Water - Climate change, economic change (wealth, employment), environmental\nconsciousness, concern for environmental sustainability, European water policy.\nPressure:\nDefinition: the variables that quantify drivers within the region, e.g. sea level, temperature,\nprecipitation, regional population, regional GDP, crop prices or gross margins, standard of\nprotection, per capita water demand, etc.\nMethod: develop regional, quantitative projections of pressure variables.\nExamples:\n\uf0b7 Coasts- Sea level, population, urbanisation, tourism, port and harbour development;\n\uf0b7 Agriculture- Climate (temperature, precipitation, etc.), prices of goods, cost of\nproduction inputs (labour, fuel, chemicals etc.), subsidies, fossil fuel energy costs;\n\uf0b7 Biodiversity- Climate, Number and size of protected sites, Land cover, Agri-\nenvironment schemes, Local policy \/ management of protected sites;\n\uf0b7 Water Climate, land cover, irrigation demand, domestic demand (household no., per\ncapita usage), catchment abstraction management, industrial demand, leakage control;\nenvironmental flow objectives;\nState:\nDefinition: variables that are representative of the system\/sector and sensitive to pressure\nvariables, e.g. extreme river flows and sea levels, land use areas, species distributions.\nMethod: use metamodels to derive sector-specific state variables that implicitly include\nautonomous (spontaneous) adaptation\nExamples:\n\uf0b7 Coasts- Coastal built environment (areas, totals), spatial distribution of coastal built\nenvironment (landscape quality), tourism arrivals (at coast), trade through ports and\nharbours (annual tonnage);\n10\n\uf0b7 Agriculture- Crop yields, farm profit, crop areas, irrigation water demand, workable\ndays, nitrate leaching, pesticides, area of biofuels;\n\uf0b7 Biodiversity- Spatial distribution of species (presence\/absence), Species and habitat\nvulnerability index, Biodiversity stewardship index (combining attributes of land use,\nland management and intent to maintain biodiversity);\n\uf0b7 Water- River flows, recharge.\nImpact:\nDefinition: a change in a state variable which has a negative or positive effect on individuals,\nsociety and\/or environmental resources\nMethod: derive impact indicators which show whether the state variables reach a certain\ncritical threshold, determined by expert knowledge\/judgement, stakeholder views and historic\nanalogues. Examples of impact indicators include the frequency of flooding, water supply-\ndemand balance, species sensitivity index, etc.\nExamples:\n\uf0b7 Coasts- Loss of landscape quality, loss of accommodation space for wetland\nmigration (coastal squeeze), average annual damages from erosion\/flooding;\n\uf0b7 Agriculture- Unacceptable farm profits, crop production below self-sufficiency level,\nirrigation water demand not achievable, land abandonment, water pollution, biofuel\ntarget;\n\uf0b7 Biodiversity- Species or habitat vulnerability index increases; habitat degradation\noccurs when land use\/management changes reach a critical level (represented by a\nchange in the biodiversity stewardship index);\n\uf0b7 Water- River flow below environmental flow objective, degree of water supply-\ndemand imbalance.\nResponse:\n11\nDefinition: planned (societal level) adaptation that aims to minimise negative impacts (or\nmaximise positive impacts \/ benefits) by acting on the socio-economic pressure variables \u2013 a\nresponse may include several policy measures, e.g. changing water consumption, restricted\nhousing development, water conservation plans, etc.\nMethods: identify adaptation options with stakeholders; use the Regional Impact Simulator to\nevaluate ways of minimising impacts by modifying the socio-economic pressure variables.\nExamples:\n\uf0b7 Coasts- Spatial planning, improve flood defences, soft engineering for wetlands;\n\uf0b7 Agriculture- Increase subsidies, promote rural diversification, extensification or\nintensification, encourage new crops, limit chemical inputs, on-farm reservoirs;\n\uf0b7 Biodiversity- Expand protected areas, Agri-environment schemes to reduce stresses,\nhabitat re-creation, managed retreat in coastal habitats;\n\uf0b7 Water- Irrigation abstraction limits; water conservation (per capita demand), restrict\nnew housing development.\nThe Drivers are in all cases qualitative descriptions of future environmental issues. They\nbound the problem that subsequent analyses will address at the regional scale. The pressures\nare the quantitative representation of these drivers that provide the inputs to the metamodels,\nalthough the pressures on one sector are sometimes derived from the states of another sector:\nland cover being a notable example. The states and impacts are the central outcomes of the\nmetamodels. Finally, the responses then act on the pressure variables in ways that reflect, for\nexample, alternative policy strategies. In using the Regional Impact Simulator, the user\nselects a \u2018scenario\u2019 that is based on a single \u2018storyline\u2019 and comprises multiple \u2018projections\u2019\n(pressure variables).\nIt is important to note that there is no feedback of the responses to the drivers, i.e. climate\nmitigation policy is not considered to be an option at the scale of the study regions, or to the\n12\nphysical pressure variables (e.g. climate variables and sea level). Furthermore, the responses\ngiven are based on generic regional options, rather than as detailed specifications of how\nthese responses could be implemented in practice. This recognises that the specialist\nknowledge of the stakeholders is an essential participatory component in using the Regional\nImpact Simulator, for downscaling generic adaptation options to practical actions or\nimplementation strategies, which allow for technological, institutional, commercial or\nlegislative constraints. Moreover, specific policy measures often reflect the institutional and\npolitical decision frameworks that exist at a given moment in time. Thus, alternative policy\nmeasures may arise from different decision frameworks, but the consequences of these\npolicies in terms of environmental outcomes may be similar. The aim of the \u2018Regional Impact\nSimulator\u2019 therefore was to focus on the overall policy goals rather than specific policy\nmeasures.\n3.2 \u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019 design\nThe final version of the Regional Impact Simulator is freely available for download from the\nUKCIP website (www.ukcip.org.uk). This section describes the process of progressing from\nan initial design concept to the final software\n3.2.1 Initial concepts\nA highly intuitive interface should enable an interested individual to use the Regional Impact\nSimulator with minimal recourse to help files and, importantly, without need for training. A\nparticipatory approach (van Asselt and Rijkens-Klomp 2002) in designing the interface would\ntherefore be crucial to the success of the project. Stakeholders, who formed the project\u2019s\nSteering Committee, would help. These individuals represented key groups including\nnational and regional Government, non-government organizations and industry. The Steering\nCommittee agreed:\n13\n\uf0b7 Design\no The layout should be informed by the DPSIR components i.e. the user should\nbe able to vary certain input parameters (Pressures) to look at the\nconsequences (Impacts) and assess the need for changes (Response);\no Numerically-labelled, rather than qualitative descriptors of magnitude, slider\nbars should be used to display and vary input parameters and increase the\ntransparency of the model\/scenario assumptions (Schneider, 1997);\no Guidance must be given to estimate \u2018realistic\u2019 ranges of values within\nscenarios and to account for uncertainty (Turnpenny et al., 2004);\no The user should be able to concurrently view and compare output from more\nthan one metamodel;\no The user should be able to explore topics in varying degrees of depth or detail\n\uf0b7 Speed\no The user should not need to go through an extensive or prolonged model set-\nup;\no The run times should be as short as possible to prevent Users \u2018switching off\u2019;\n\uf0b7 Scale\no The principle outputs should be presented at regional scales;\no More detailed mapped output should be available, but conditionally;\no Because the tool is not intended for intervention in specific policy analysis,\nthe responses available should be given as regional outcomes rather than the\npolicies that would accomplish those outcomes.\nBased upon the initial underlying concepts for the Regional Impact Simulator, the first\n\u2018mock-up\u2019 design agreed with the stakeholder Steering Committee is shown in Figure 2.\n3.2.2 Final design\n14\nThe RegIS2 study confirmed earlier studies that significant effort is required to create a clear\nuser interface (Turnpenny et al., 2004). Hence the Regional Impact Simulator went through\nmany subsequent iterations with input from the project team and Steering Committee over a\nperiod of two years. Important additions or evolutions to the initial design include:\n\uf0b7 The original single screen interface evolved to three screens each with a different\npurpose, and increasing levels of interaction with the model variables. The single\ninterface screen became too complex and off-putting to some stakeholders. The\nscreens now provide an ordered hierarchy of user interaction with the simulator and,\nmore importantly, the DPSIR approach to thinking about change:\no The Predefined Scenario Futures screen (Figure 3) allows the user to\nrapidly become familiar with indicators and their sensitivity to the different\nclimate and socio-economic scenarios. The default set of values for each\nscenario is based upon pre-existing data (e.g. from Hulme et al., 2002 or\nShackley and Deanwood, 2003) or expert judgement.\no The Exploratory Analysis screen (Figure 4) allows the user to explore a\nscenario in greater detail by changing the scenario pressure variables (input\nparameter values) used in the models. This enables the user to explore the\neffects of the widely acknowledged uncertainty in any scenario, which cannot\nbe defined by a single set of unique values.\no The Influencing the Impacts screen (Figure 5) allows the user to test\nregional adaptation responses to the impacts identified with the Exploratory\nAnalysis screen. After an impact indicator is selected, a list of responses\nwhich are known to affect the chosen indicator is presented. The user is able\nto \u201crespond\u201d to the impact by changing sliders which thus change the\nparameters and re-running the model. Changes in the model outputs allow the\nuser to identify potential regional adaptation responses that reduce or\nminimise the impact.\n15\n\uf0b7 Extensive use of tooltips were included to minimize the user from having to resort to\nthe Help Files; by hovering the mouse over a component or term on the screen a short\ndefinition or explanation appears\n\uf0b7 A traffic light-based system of colour coding of the slider bars was used to\ncommunicate the uncertainty of a scenario; green denotes uncertainty that is\n\u201ccredible\u201d within the context of a scenario storyline (green for \u2018go\u2019); yellow denotes\nwider uncertainty that may be possible, but which is outside of the considered\nwisdom for the scenario (yellow for \u2018caution\u2019). For obvious reasons, a user is not\npermitted to enter a red, or \u2018no go\u2019 zone;\n\uf0b7 A library of photographs of plant species was included;\n\uf0b7 Climate mitigation is a \u201cresponse\u201d that has an effect on climate \u201cpressures\u201d in the\nmodel e.g. rainfall. However, a regional scale mitigation response, in isolation, will\nnot affect the future climate. Therefore, it was decided to separate the Pressures\n(which include the climate variables) from the Responses within the Interface, by the\ncreation of the separate \u2018Influencing the Impacts\u2019 screen to explore adaptation.\n3.3 Modular integration within the \u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019\nAccording to Leimbach and Jaeger (2004), the typical IA model is a \u201cmore or less monolithic\nmodel, in which different components, programmed in the same programming language, are\nstrongly interlinked with each other\u201d. They can range from models with relatively compact\ncoding (e.g. the DICE model- Nordhaus, 1994) to detailed mechanistic models with complex\ncoding (e.g. the IMAGE model- Alcamo, 1994).\nHowever, the simulator relies on diverse software programs. The development of each\nmetamodel was undertaken by sectoral specialists working within different institutions that\nwere not computer scientists and who used different model development paradigms and\n16\nprogramming languages. To facilitate metamodel development, calibration and validation at\nthe different universities and research institutes within RegIS2, a modular approach to model\nintegration was adopted. An Object Oriented approach allowed the modules (or meta-\nmodels) which were written in various programming languages to be compiled in libraries of\nexecutable functions (DLLs) or executables (EXEs). The meta-models are run as serial\nprocesses (sequentially in the order: High River Flow, Flood, Agriculture, Water Resources,\nBiodiversity) with the inclusion of parallel processes where possible.\nThe modular architecture means that all of the metamodels can be run autonomously. They\nare developed and tested as stand-alone versions before being integrated with the other\nmetamodels and interface components. The modular architecture allows the metamodels to be\nreplaced or updated as required without disabling the entire simulator (provided that their\noutput data files meet the agreed format and structure of data exchange). This greatly aids\nmodel development. It does not, however, eliminate the need for calibration, validation and\ntesting because many of the metamodel inputs depend on the outputs of other metamodels.\nThe need to achieve agreement about the format and types of information exchange is of\nprimary importance in developing a successful tool. Although desirable, it is rarely possible\nto define this from the outset. Therefore flexibility is required to accommodate new and\nevolving requests from the model developers and users.\n4 Scenarios\n4.1 Climate scenarios\nFour climate change scenarios for 30 year-timeslices were included in the simulator - 2020s\nLow emissions, 2020s High emissions, 2050s Low emissions and 2050s High emissions -\n17\nfrom the UKCIP02 scenarios (Hulme et al., 2002). The Low and High emissions scenarios\ncapture the effects of uncertainties in future global greenhouse gas emissions on UK climate,\nwhile the two timeslices (2020s and 2050s) allow investigation of the evolution of change.\nIncreases in mean annual temperature, relative to 1961-90, range from 0.3 to 1.1oC for the\n2020s and 0.5 to 2.6oC for the 2050s. In all seasons, and for all scenarios, there is a northwest\nto southeast gradient in the magnitude of the climate warming over the UK, the southeast\nconsistently warming by several tenths of a degree Celsius more than the northwest. Changes\nin total annual precipitation, relative to 1961-90, range from \u20134 to +3% by the 2020s and \u20139\nto +7% by the 2050s. Winter precipitation increases in all regions with the largest changes of\nup to 23% occurring in the east. Conversely, in summer, precipitation decreases across\nvirtually all of the UK with the largest changes of up to \u201332% occurring in the south. Global-\naverage sea levels are predicted to rise by 6-7 cm by the 2020s and 14-18cm by the 2050s.\nAll of the UKCIP02 scenarios are based on the high-resolution regional climate model\n(HadRM3) from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, but the credible\nuncertainty range on the climate pressure slider bars indicates the range of predictions of\nregional climates over the UK simulated by other global climate models based on Hulme et\nal., (2002).\n4.2 Socio-economic scenarios\nFuture socio-economic change can be as significant, if not more significant, than climate\nchange for some sectors (Holman et al., 2005b; Rounsevell et al., 2005; Rounsevell et al.,\n2006), such that the widespread practice of studying the impacts of future climate change as if\nit were to affect today\u2019s society is becoming increasingly untenable. Socio-economic\nscenarios are, to a certain extent, based on assumptions that are known to be tenuous (Gaffin\net al., 2004). However, such scenarios are not intended to predict the future, but help to\n18\nevaluate societal responses to major environmental changes such as global climate change,\nassuming that (Morris et al., 2004):\n1. The future is unlike the past, and is shaped by human choice and action;\n2. The future cannot be foreseen, but exploring the future can inform present decisions;\n3. There are many possible futures, so scenarios map the \u2018possibility space\u2019;\n4. Scenario development involves a mix of rational analysis and subjective judgement.\nIn accordance with the RegIS funders and UKCIP, socio-economic scenarios (also referred to\nas \u2018non-climate change\u2019 scenarios) were used. In contrast to co-evolutionary scenarios (e.g.\nLorenzoni et al., 2000) where climate and socio-economic changes interact, these scenarios\nlook at socio-economic change in isolation (without the compounding effects of climate\nchange). Using \u2018non-climate change\u2019 socio-economic scenarios has the benefit that it permits\na clearer distinction between the effects of physical climate change, and socio-economic\nchanges (and hence identifies more clearly the role of response to the impacts identified),\nwhich are difficult to untangle within co-evolutionary socio-economic scenarios.\nThe four original RegIS socio-economic scenarios for the two regions (Holman et al., 2005a;\nShackley & Deanwood, 2003) were refined, updated and an improved spatial resolution\nimplemented. From the qualitative scenarios for the region, projections for a number of\nquantitative non-spatial and spatial indicators have been developed for use as inputs to the\nnumerical models, based on the qualitative storylines and informed by regional trends,\nGovernment projections and Regional Planning Guidance. These indicators are: population,\nGross Value Added (GVA), persons per household, population density and spatial distribution\nof development, woodland and Protected Areas (e.g. National Parks, designated sites, nature\nreserves etc).\nThe regional descriptive storylines of alternative futures were derived from an iterative\nprocedure between researchers and stakeholders at national, regional and local levels and are\n19\nbroadly similar to the related national (UKCIP, 2001; Berkhout et al., 2002) and global\nnarratives (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000; Arnell et al., 2004). The four regional scenarios are\n\uf0b7 Global Sustainability: the global approaches to achieving sustainable development\ntake precedence over regional responses. The World is seen as an interconnected\nwhole, functionally and morally, with a concentration on the wider impacts of\nindividual actions.\n\uf0b7 Global Markets: based on the pursuit of high and sustained growth within a global\ncontext. All regional assets will be brought to bear in this ambition and significant\nrisks will be taken as to the precise composition of the development path.\n\uf0b7 Regional Stewardship: an emphasis on recognising and conserving regional assets,\naccepting that this might result in a significantly reduced level of economic growth\nand even a contraction of the economy in some respects. This is accepted because of\nthe pursuit of a more all-embracing means of living, one which recognises the\nimportance of community and the value of local natural assets.\n\uf0b7 Regional Enterprise: the most bullish of the scenarios, suggesting vibrant, semi-\nautonomous regions, keen to promote and maintain their distinctive qualities in a\nhighly competitive world. A key to their success will be the imaginative development\nof assets and core strengths, some economic, some social, others environmental.\n4.3 Scenario linkage \u2013how to link and what to link\nOnly one option to date links the formally independent climate and socio-economic (non-\nclimate) scenarios: internally consistent emissions scenarios. This is based on the rationale\nthat certain socio-economic scenarios (i.e.; a strong market-driven socio-economic scenario\nsuch as Global Markets) will likely be consistent with higher emissions of carbon, whilst\n20\nothers (i.e.; a community-based socio-economic scenario such as Regional Stewardship) will\nbe more consistent with lower emissions of carbon.\nThe alternative and chosen approach within the simulator was to provide no formal linkage\nbetween the two sets of scenarios, but to leave the choice to the user. This approach was\npreferred because of the greater flexibility afforded to the user (Table 2). The climate change\nscenarios are dependent upon global emissions of carbon; the socio-economic scenarios\noperate at a range of scales from the local to global. Formally linking the socio-economic\nscenarios and the climate change scenarios \u2013 within this simulator \u2013 would mean choosing\none socio-economic scenario that would prevail at local as well as regional and national levels\nand hold true everywhere in the world. This is a highly unlikely situation. So the ability to\ninvestigate alternative trajectories of regional socio-economic development (e.g. Turnpenny et\nal., 2005 and CRed \u2013 Carbon Reduction Programme in the East of England) that are not\nnecessarily consistent with global developments was allowed.\n4. Metamodels\nThe environmental and resources sectors modelled (agriculture, biodiversity, coasts and\nfloodplains and water resource management) were originally selected as a result of\nstakeholder concerns in the study areas (Science and Policy Associates & ESYS, 1996).\nHowever, the scope of the models, their output indicators and the linkages between the\nmodels have been greatly expanded and improved from their initial form in RegIS (described\nin Holman et al., 2005a).\n21\n4.1 Flooding (fluvial and coastal environments)\nThe flooding metamodel (Mokrech et al., 2008) considers the impacts of both climate change-\ninduced sea-level rise and changing flood flows in rivers, and the effects on the distribution of\nsaltmarsh and coastal and fluvial grazing marsh. The flooding methodology uses the 2003\nIndicative Floodplain Map (from the Environment Agency) to identify the flood hazard zones\nfor the 200-year and 100-year events for coastal and fluvial floodplains, respectively. The\neffect of relative sea level rise on coastal flooding is estimated by raising the present surge\nheights by the magnitude of relative sea-level rise (i.e. including regional land\nuplift\/subsidence), leading to a reduction in the defence standards (Nicholls and Wilson,\n2001). For fluvial flooding, the High Flows metamodel, based on the Catchment Descriptors\nmethod (Bayliss, 1999), simulates the median annual flood (or QMED) Indicator (Robson and\nReed, 1999). An increase in this peak river flow is translated into an increase in the risk of\nflooding and vice versa. This is based on a relationship between the change in flow, initial\nstandard of protection afforded by flood defences and change in defence standard.\nThe impact of sea level rise on coastal habitats (Richards et al., 2008) is modelled based on\nthe capacity for saltmarshes to respond vertically (accrete) and horizontally (retreat \/ advance)\nto sea-level rise. The user can explore the potential for saltmarsh gains to occur, for example,\ndue to managed realignment of coastal defences (a response) or unplanned coastal\nabandonment (another response option), but will often be at the expense of coastal grazing\nmarsh (another impact) (Nicholls and Wilson, 2001). The creation of compensatory inland\nfluvial grazing marsh in sustainable locations is also explored by the metamodel.\n4.2 Agriculture\nThe agriculture metamodel (Audsley et al., 2008) was developed to simulate rapidly the\nresults of the agricultural land use model described in Holman et al., (2005a) and Rounsevell\n22\net al., (2003). The method combines a metamodel that estimates the yield of a wide range of\ncrops as a function of climate and soil type with a farm metamodel which determines the\noptimum cropping given crop gross margins, labour and machinery costs and soil workability\n(see Rounsevell et al., 2003, for a full explanation). The yield metamodel used a neural\nnetwork fitted to spatial modelled yield data (from Holman et al., 2005a), derived using the\nACCESS model and data on soil, weather, latitude, carbon dioxide and irrigation.\nBased upon the input variables set by the user, the farm metamodel calculates the area of each\ncrop that maximises profit according to the crop gross margin of the crop, the soil type and\nworkable hours in the winter, the maturity date of each crop, spring and autumn evaporation\nand rainfall, and the change in labour and machinery costs. A regression approach is used to\npredict the percentage of the farm in a given crop and the profit. The results of the\nagricultural metamodel then give the level and area of production of each commodity in each\nregion.\n4.3 Water resources management\nThe water resources management metamodel (Henriques et al., 2008) has a number of\nmodules operating at different spatial scales. For each catchment, the naturalized flow\nduration curve (FDC) is simulated based upon the Low Flow Estimation methodology\n(Gustard et al., 1992) according to the distribution of soil types, urbanization (from the socio-\neconomic scenarios), climate, cropping and land use classes (from the Agricultural\nmetamodel). From the FDC, the availability of water for abstraction in each catchment is\ncalculated, after allowing for the environmental flow requirements of the river (Dunbar et al.,\n2004). This limits abstraction to protect low flows and flow variability, whilst also\nrecognising that abstraction is not unlimited at the high flow end of the FDC.\n23\nA region includes many catchments. The regional water supply availability is derived from\nthe abstraction availability in its catchments, water imports\/exports and reservoir storage.\nRegional water demand is calculated from the agricultural water demand (output from the\nagricultural metamodel), domestic, industrial and commercial demand (based upon the socio-\neconomic scenario selected) and leakage from the mains water network. Finally a supply-\ndemand balance for the region provides a measure of the robustness of the supply-demand\nsystem to the pressures exerted in the scenario, and hence the need (or not) for adaptation.\n4.4 Biodiversity\nThe SPECIES model (Spatial Estimator of the Climate Impacts on the Envelope of Species;\nPearson et al., 2002; Harrison et al., in press) is used to simulate the impacts of climate\nchange on the potential geographical distribution of 46 species associated with 8 habitats that\ninteract with the agricultural, coastal and water environments. SPECIES uses an artificial\nneural network to characterise the currently suitable climate space for a species and to\nestimate likely changes in its spatial distribution. In this way it is possible to examine how the\nclimate space of individual species contracts, expands or shifts as the climate changes.\nPredictions of potential climate space for each species are combined with data on the\ndistribution of habitats, protected sites and outputs from the other metamodels to simulate the\nimpacts of climate and socio-economic changes on species\u2019 suitability at the regional scale\n(Harrison et al., 2008). For the coastal species, simulated changes in salt marsh and coastal\nand floodplain grazing marsh areas are used. For fens and bog species, outputs from the\nwater resources metamodel of indicators of low and high flows are related to species\u2019\npreferences for dry and wet conditions, respectively. For lowland heath and upland hay\nmeadows, output from the agricultural metamodel for land use distribution and from the\nsocio-economic scenarios of the distribution of protected sites is used to assess habitat loss.\nHabitat re-creation is simulated according to rules associated with historic habitat\n24\ndistributions, relevant soil properties, output from the agricultural metamodel on land use\ndistribution and proximity to existing habitat. Finally, for cereal field margins, outputs from\nthe agricultural metamodel on nitrogen inputs and the distribution of arable land use are\nrelated to species\u2019 tolerances to nitrogen stress for plants, whilst output on switches from\nspring to autumn sowing is related to the availability of over-winter food supplies for higher\norganisms.\nFigure 6 demonstrates how the metamodels interact.\n5. System performance\nThe run times for the Regional Impact Simulator are longer than was initially hoped for, prior\nto model development. This partly relates to the finer spatial resolution adopted by the\nflooding metamodel (1km) and partly to the reading and writing of files between the\nmetamodels. The runtime is also highly computer-dependent, as can be seen from Table 3,\nwhich shows the run-times for three contrasting PCs. Although the new PC had a run time of\nless than 20 seconds, this can be reduced to around 10 seconds when run without the\nbiodiversity models- the last in the cascade of metamodels.\n6. Discussion\nThere is a need for tools such as the Regional Impact Simulator. But stakeholder-led software\ndesign and the integration of the simulator components are difficult.\nWithin the UK, there is an acknowledged need for better quality, locally-relevant information\non climate change impacts. The UK government (DETR, 2000) has identified the need for\nmore detailed and quantitative impact assessments to underpin regional adaptation strategies.\nOne reason cited for the rather limited response of local government to climate change is\n25\n\u2018difficulty accessing and interpreting good-quality environmental information\u2019 (RCEP, 2002 -\npara 6.4).\nAccessibility refers to both cognitive accessibility - the ease of understanding - and practical\naccessibility - the ease of application (Demeritt and Langdon, 2004). In their analysis of the\nreception and response of local government to climate change information, Demeritt and\nLangdon (2004) demonstrated the importance of credibility and its appropriateness to the\naudience. They also showed positive associations between the perceived accuracy of an\ninformation source (e.g. Government Department, internet, NGO\u2019s etc) and the frequency of\nuse of information from that source, and between frequency of use and ease of understanding.\nThis suggests that there is a need for tools such as the Regional Impact Simulator, but only if\nthey are perceived by stakeholders as: credible, accurate, easy to understand, and appropriate.\nThe development of an easy to use and efficient software tool for a broad range of\nstakeholders involves compromises. For example, if speedier model runtimes are necessary\nthen the model complexity must be reduced in their form. It is therefore important to judge\nwhether an acceptable balance has been met by satisfying the above requirements in the\nRegional Impact Simulator.\n6.1 Does the Regional Impact Simulator provide credible outputs?\nCredibility reflects the ability of users to understand both the models\u2019 assumptions and the\nlinks between the model outputs and the choices they have made (Carmichael et al 2004).\nThere are many elements to credibility including testable calculations, transparency (of\nmodels assumptions, cause-effect linkages etc), inclusion of critical issues (Alcamo et al.,\n1996) and for an acceptable balance between openness and rigour (Fontela, 2000). The\nmultiple facets that underpin the credibility of an IAM in the eyes of stakeholders must be\n26\napproached from a variety of perspectives. To increase the likelihood that stakeholders would\nfind the Regional Impact Simulator credible, the following were done:\n\uf0b7 The metamodels were based on widely accepted pre-existing models (e.g. SPECIES-\nPearson et al., 2002; Flood Estimation Handbook \u2013 Bayliss, 1999; Low Flows-\nGustard et al., 1992; Silsoe Whole Farm Model- Rounsevell et al., 2003);\n\uf0b7 The simplification of the pre-existing models into metamodels allows them to be\nunderstood and explained in lay terms (Turnpenny et al., 2004);\n\uf0b7 The slider bars with which the user changes the Pressures or Responses show the\nnumerical values, as opposed to qualitative descriptors (e.g. \u201cless\u201d, \u201cmore\u201d etc. as\nused in GB-QUEST- Carmichael et al., 2004) to make the magnitude of the changes\nbeing made by the user more clear;\n\uf0b7 Fast runtimes enable users to carry out many simulations and rapidly investigate the\nsensitivity of the system under baseline conditions to changes to the Pressure\nvariables, and to compare this, where appropriate, with their own knowledge;\n\uf0b7 When an Indicator of concern is selected in the Influencing the Impacts screen, the\nuser is automatically guided to the Responses that affect that Indicator making more\ntransparent those choices with greatest potential effect;\n\uf0b7 A hierarchy of user support was implemented: tooltips give immediate short\ndefinitions and explanations of interface features; help files give background\ninformation about a scenario \/ model \/ indicator etc, sufficient for the vast number of\nusers; and full documentation is also provided within the Help files for the technical\nusers who require it;\n\uf0b7 Explicitly communicating that the model inputs themselves, which are derived from\nthe scenarios, are uncertain. A major challenge in modelling is how to convey\nuncertainty in understandable and approachable ways (Carmichael et al., 2004).\nConsiderable effort has been expended on methods of conveying uncertainty (e.g.\nKandlikar et al., 2005). The colour coding approach used in the Regional Impact\n27\nSimulator, and the breadth of these traffic light-coloured uncertainty bands on the\nslider bars conveys clearly that different, but plausible, values (due to the uncertain\nassumptions behind them) are likely to give rise to differing outcomes - which the\nuser is encouraged to explore.\n6.2 Can the outputs of the simulator be demonstrated to be accurate?\nAs described in Mokrech et al. (2008), Henriques et al. (2008), Audsley et al. (2008),\nHarrison et al. (2008) and Richards et al. (2008), all of the reduced form models within the\nsimulator have either been validated against model results from peer-reviewed, pre-existing\nmodels or against observed data. Their accuracy can therefore be demonstrated.\nApproaching stakeholders with these reports and academic papers, however, is unlikely to be\neffective. Relevant information needs to be easily accessible at the time the user is actually\nengaged in an assessment activity, which in a tool such as the Regional Impact Simulator is\nachieved by clearly incorporating the information within the Help File of the software.\n6.3 Are the results easy to understand?\nThe intuitiveness of the Interface and the usefulness of the indicators and results were all\ngenerally positively received in the evaluation (described in Holman and Harman, 2008),\nsuggesting that this modelling system is relatively easy to understand for a wide range of\nstakeholders.\n6.4 Are the results appropriate to the target audience?\nThe Regional Impact Simulator is a generic tool intended to interest a wide range of\npractitioners, who have different interests, operating under a variety of different conditions\nand constraints. Recognizing that a generic tool cannot be all things to all people, the\n28\nevaluation of its usefulness was generally positive. More specific applications that link to\nspecific plans, policies or strategies would require customized versions (Demeritt and\nLangdon 2004) as there are too many possibilities. More specific application therefore\ndepends on the expert judgement of the users to re-interpret the results in light of their own\nknowledge of their field. To be successful, the user needs to take the time to explore and\nthink.\nDespites its general nature, comments received during the evaluation of the Regional Impact\nSimulator (described in Holman and Harman, 2008) suggest that a range of stakeholders\nrecognise the potential for the outputs to support their activities.\n\u201cWe believe that [the Regional Impacts Simulator] has a huge potential to raise\nawareness of the implications of policy decisions, and therefore guide policy and\ndecision makers down a more sustainable track\u201d\n\u201cIt's very encouraging to see the potential solutions for many items that are put into\nthe 'too difficult' box.\u201d\n\u201ctool provides a valuable (essential) advocative medium to embed need for adaptation\nand underpin cross sectoral policy development\/decision making\u201d\n7. Conclusions\nThis article describes the application of a participatory design approach to the development of\na regional integrated assessment tool, the Regional Impact Simulator. The Regional Impact\nSimulator was designed to allow a wide range of stakeholders to explore potential climate and\nsocio-economic change in two regions of England and the potential future consequences of\ntheir responses. The development of a highly intuitive interface requires a participatory\napproach to design. Early stakeholder engagement provided agreed fundamental design and\n29\nfunctionality concepts at the outset. However, participatory design requires an iterative\napproach to both software and interface development, which is not best served by\nconventional programming. The object-oriented approach used in the Regional Impact\nSimulator has demonstrated the value of software modularity in allowing different research\ngroups to iteratively develop their models autonomously according to progressive stakeholder\nfeedback. The ultimate credibility of any Integrated Assessment tool in the eyes of\nstakeholders is not a given. A multifaceted approach was adopted, encompassing\ntransparency, interactivity, hierarchical user support and explicit communication of\nuncertainty. The use of metamodels or reduced form models, together with binary file\nexchange, has enabled the Regional Impact Simulator to provide the stakeholder User with\ninteractive integrated assessments of the effects of climate and\/or socio-economic change on\nagriculture, water resources, biodiversity and coastal and river flooding in typically less than\n20 seconds. However, the responses given by the Simulator are based on generic regional\noptions, rather than as detailed specifications of how these responses could be implemented in\npractice. This recognises that the specialist knowledge of the stakeholders is an essential\nparticipatory component in using the Regional Impact Simulator. It is hoped that the\nprovision of such tools for use by stakeholders will help them better prepare for the impacts\nof climate change.\n8.
