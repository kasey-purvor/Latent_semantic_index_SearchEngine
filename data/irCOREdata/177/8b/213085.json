The first, by Patricia Frericks and Robert Maier, examines the effects of norms and\npension reform policies from a gender perspective. More specifically, they look into specific\npolicies such as employment, tax incentives, care credits, parental leave, that eventually all\nrelate to pension schemes and benefit levels. The analysis concludes that, while recent policies\nattempted to address gender inequalities, many current policies still do not adequately address\ngender pension gaps and, in some cases, they even increase it. The final chapter, by Martin\nKohli, touches upon concepts and attitudes toward generational equity and how these concepts\nare reflected in public attitudes towards pensions and redistribution of income in old age.\nOverall, the book tackles key issues of recent welfare reform with new perspectives and\non the basis of new empirical evidence. The overall picture is complex: empirical evidence\nfrom difference welfare systems suggests that there is convergence with respect to the original\nregime classifications and divergence with respect to the new differentiations. In other words,\npension systems are moving farther and farther away from the ideal types embodied in regime\nclassifications, and the new reality that emerges is that of countries that have become \u2018hybrids\u2019.\nRecent pension reforms are found to be less dependent on rigid past welfare structures and\nmore on pragmatics and resources, incorporating features from competing basic designs. The\nfindings that are presented in the book also emphasise the complexity of the outcome of any\npension reform. Evidence shows that pension reforms have differential impacts on different\nsocial groups. Some reforms are likely to increase the future well being of specific groups but\nat the risk of decreasing that of others. It is important to systematically examine outcomes of\npension reform from gender and cohort perspectives and to project the expected outcomes\nagainst the likely evolution of life course patterns of employment and family structures.\nPerhaps the most important contribution of the book is its focus on fairness and justice\nand with public discourse regarding pension reform. As discussed in the book, there is no\nclear-cut generational divide in people\u2019s attitudes and support for the welfare state and for its\npension system. Thus, the overall all message of the book, as argued by its editors, is of much\nimportance: \u2018many of the received ideas need to be replaced by a richer and better grounded\naccount of how institutions cluster, change, and influence outcomes.\u2019 (p. 18).\nisrael (issi) doron\nUniversity of Haifa\nGuy Palmer, Tom MacInnes and Peter Kenway (2008), Monitoring Poverty and Social\nExclusion 2008.

With the economic downturn and the credit crisis pushed off the\nfront pages only by daily revelations over MPs expense claims, Labour looks set for catastrophic\ngeneral election defeat, the question no longer if but when. We seem a long way from the\nhalcyon days of 1999, when Tony Blair launched Opportunity for All, an annual government\nreport monitoring poverty and social exclusion, and pledged to eradicate child poverty in a\ngeneration \u2013 a breadth of vision and clarity of purpose which it is difficult to associate with\ntoday\u2019s government.\nThe Opportunity for All reports have been quietly discontinued \u2013 the last indicators\nupdate was published online in 2007 \u2013 but the New Policy Institute has continued to produce\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n730 reviews\nits own, independent, annual monitoring volume. The latest report, Monitoring Poverty and\nSocial Exclusion 2008, by Guy Palmer, Tom MacInnes and Peter Kenway, is the tenth anniversary\nedition, and the authors are keen to mark the occasion by ensuring that the focus is as broad as\nit was at the start. In the intervening decade, they argue, the government\u2019s agenda has narrowed\nsharply, with an ambitious and wide-ranging set of goals reduced to a near-exclusive focus on\nthe child poverty target: \u2018Ten years ago, the challenge was to get child poverty reduction added\nto the government\u2019s agenda. Ten years on, the challenge is to prevent it dominating the social\npolicy agenda to the exclusion of virtually all else\u2019 (p. 18). The blame for this shift they place\nat the door of campaigners at least as much as politicians, and they do not exempt themselves,\npointing to a growing share of space in the monitoring reports dedicated to indicators of low\nincome among households with children.\nThis report contains data for 56 indicators covering children but also young adults, working\nage adults, older people and communities. What do the indicators tell us? First, they provide\nfurther confirmation of a picture which may now be familiar \u2013 the striking difference between\nachievements in Labour\u2019s first five years and its second five. Analysing progress in these two\nperiods, the authors find that out of the 56 indicators, only five show a better trend in the\nsecond than the first period. In the first five years, 30 of the indicators improved and just seven\nworsened (the rest remaining steady). In the second five years, 14 improved while 15 worsened.\nThe share of low-income households and (related) the value of social security benefits relative\nto average earnings for pensioners and children are among the indicators where positive early\ntrends were not sustained. Indicators where progress not only stalled but went sharply into\nreverse after 2003 include unemployment among young adults, with the gains between 1999\nand 2003 undone well before the onset of the current recession.\nSecond, there are measures which have seen no period of progress but have been steady\nor deteriorating over the period as a whole. There are only a handful of these, but the report\nhighlights two in particular which raise serious questions about the government\u2019s central focus\non work as the best route of poverty. One million more working adults lived below the 60 per\ncent poverty line in 2006\/07 than in the mid-1990s; while the number of working households\nwith children reliant on tax credits to lift them over the poverty line has also risen. Some half\na million more children in working households had incomes below the threshold before tax\ncredits in 2005\/6 than in 2001\/02, suggesting that some working families have moved from a\nposition secure without tax credits to a position in which they are needed.\nAmid this tale of gloom, there are snippets of good news \u2013 indicators which have continued\nto improve throughout the decade, or where progress has picked up over time. These include\nsome of the measures of educational achievement (for example, the share of 16 year olds failing\nto get five or more GCSEs), the pay gap for low-paid women, the share of households with no\nbank account, the proportion of adults who have been victims of burglary or violent crime,\nthe share of non-decent homes. As the report points out, these are all crucial indicators\nwhich have great significance for the quality of life of some of the most vulnerable, but\nwhich receive little or no press attention (or in the case of crime rates, attention but no\ncredibility).\nTwo-thirds of the indicators in the 2008 report are the same as in the report for 1998, but\nthere are also a number of new indicators, with three in particular appearing in the report for\nthe first time \u2013 costs, prices and debt. Though a full time series is not available for these, their\ninclusion is clearly timely given the current economic situation. The focus on the differential\nimpact of inflation for different income groups is particularly illuminating. The CPI indicator\nshows that inflation has been higher for the lowest quintile, with poorer pensioners particularly\naffected: the inflation rate for this group was 20 per cent between 2004 and 2008, compared to\n14 per cent for non-pensioner households on average incomes.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nreviews 731\nColourful and well laid out, the graphs bring the indicators to life: flicking through the\npages provides an instant impression and some striking statistics. The report is also scrupulous\nin providing detailed notes about each indicator, including a very honest assessment of the\nindicator\u2019s reliability. Backed up by the supporting website, www.poverty.org.uk, this makes for\na really valuable independent resource. But this is not just a series of pictures, and the authors\nbring out forcefully their main messages: that the government got it right early on with its\nbroad, many-sided agenda, and that the narrowing of its vision has been fatal to its efforts;\nthat child poverty cannot be eradicated through tax credits alone; and that \u2018work\u2019 must be not\nidealised but scrutinised as a response, with a view to understanding the problems it can cause\nas well as the solutions that it can provide. Let us hope that the New Policy Institute continue\nto provide an annual check on progress \u2013 or regression \u2013 in the lean years to come.\nkitty stewart\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science\n"}
