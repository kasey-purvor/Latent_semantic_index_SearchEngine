INTRODUCTION\nThe material Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y has been attracting con-\nsiderable interest recently because it can be grown lattice\nmatched on GaAs substrates and has a narrower band gap\nthan GaAs.1 It can therefore extend the photoresponse of\nGaAs-based optoelectronic devices to beyond 1.3 \u0001m, which\npreviously could only be achieved by strained\nInxGa1\u2212xAs\/GaAs quantum wells or metamorphic InGaAs\nlayers.2 Hence, there is interest in using this material for\nGaAs-based photodetectors3\u20138 and multijunction photovol-\ntaic cells.9,10 GaAs-based photodetectors can utilize high-\nreflectivity AlAs\/GaAs mirrors4 and the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nmaterial has been predicted to have low avalanche noise,8\nwhile photovoltaic cells can benefit from long wavelength\nabsorption.\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y as grown for photodetectors and photo-\nvoltaic cells is distinct from the strained Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nmultiple quantum wells employed in 1.3 and 1.5 \u0001m wave-\nlengths laser diodes. For these former applications, high\nquality growth of thick \u0001relative to quantum well dimen-\nsions\u0002 Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y with good lattice matching to GaAs\nsubstrates and low unintentional doping concentration are\nessential. The thickness is required to ensure efficient ab-\nsorption of incident light and hence high responsivity \u0001for\nphotodetectors\u0002 or efficiency \u0001for photovoltaic cells\u0002. Any\nappreciable lattice mismatch to GaAs could therefore result\nin dislocations occurring which would adversely affect the\ndevice performance. The low unintentional doping concen-\ntration in the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer ensures full depletion,\neven at low reverse voltage, enabling low operating voltage\nphotodetectors and high efficiency photovoltaic cells.\nIn order to operate at longer wavelengths, the band gap\nof Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y has to decrease, which can be achieved\nby increasing the indium and the nitrogen content. However,\nthe difficulty of incorporating significant amounts of nitrogen\ninto Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y is usually overcome by using a low\ngrowth temperature,11\u201313 which can adversely affect the crys-\ntal quality. Therefore, an increasing nitrogen content is often\nlinked to degradation in the optical and electrical properties\nof Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y as indicated by reduced photolumines-\ncence intensity14,15 and a reduced open-circuit voltage for\nphotovoltaic cells.10 Postgrowth thermal annealing can\nsometimes improve the photoluminescence intensity15 but\nthis has the undesirable effect of increasing the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y band gap. To avoid over-reliance on post-\ngrowth annealing to improve material quality, high quality,\nas-grown, thick Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers with narrow band\ngap and lattice match to GaAs are required.\nThere have been several reports of photoluminescence\nand x-ray data obtained from thick Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y \u0001Refs.\n10\u201314\u0002 but few reports on bulk Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y device char-\nacteristics. Reports on the electrical characteristics and pho-\ntoresponse of bulk Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y diodes operating at\nwavelengths up to 1.3 \u0001m are limited to.4\u20137 The p\u2212 i\u2212n di-\nodes reported in Ref. 6 had Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y i regions up to\n2 \u0001m thick, but the absorption edge was less than \u00031.22 \u0001m\nand the reverse dark currents were measured for a limited\nfield range up to 25 kV\/cm. Cheah et al.5 compared the dark\ncurrent characteristics of Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212ySb and\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y p\u2212 i\u2212n diodes with an absorption edge at\n\u00031.35 \u0001m. They concluded that in order to simultaneously\nachieve a reasonably low reverse dark current and light ab-\nsorption at \u00031.3 \u0001m, use of a pentanary bulk\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212ySb i region was necessary. Ptak et al. re-\nported unintentional doping concentration of 2\u00021013 cm\u22123\nyielding a depletion width of 3 \u0001m for Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y di-\nodes but the nitrogen content was relatively small, giving\nband gaps ranging from 1.26 to 1.34 eV.9 Recently, Loke et\nal.7 reported an as-grown Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y p\u2212 i\u2212n diode\nwith 0.5 \u0001m thick i region but the responsivity is rather low\n\u00010.016 A\/W for a photon energy of 0.92 eV\u0002 and the reserve\ndark currents are very high.\nIn this article, we present our study on the optical, struc-\ntural and electrical properties of a series of bulka\u0002Electronic mail: j.s.ng@sheffield.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 101, 064506 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/101\u00026\u0001\/064506\/6\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics101, 064506-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

We carried out measurements of x-ray rocking curves\nand photoluminescence on as-grown wafers as well as of\ncapacitance-voltage, current-voltage, electroluminescence,\nand photocurrent on devices fabricated from the wafers.\nII. WAFER STRUCTURES AND GROWTH\nThe series of wafers consist of three nominally lattice-\nmatched Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y p\u2212 i\u2212n diode wafers grown on\n\u0001001\u0002 n+ GaAs substrates using a VG Semicon V80H mo-\nlecular beam epitaxy system equipped with conventional\nsolid sources for group-III, Be for p type and Si for n type\ndopants, an Applied EPI cracker source for As2, and an Ox-\nford Applied Research radio frequency plasma source for the\nnitrogen. Structures of the three wafers studied are described\nin Table I. The doping concentrations in the GaAs and\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y claddings were nominally 2\u00021018 cm\u22123.\nThe n+ and p+ GaAs claddings were grown at 590 \u00b0C\nwith a growth rate of 0.5 \u0001m per hour. For the growth of the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer \u0001including the p+ and n+\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y claddings\u0002 the temperature was reduced to\n450 \u00b0C to encourage incorporation of nitrogen into the\nlattice-matched Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer.13 The growth rate for\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y was 0.56 \u0001m per hour. The nitrogen plasma\nsource was operated with a radio frequency \u0001rf\u0002 power of 184\nW. Growth interruption was introduced between the growth\nof the n+ GaAs cladding and the n+ Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y clad-\nding in order to stabilize the rf power of the nitrogen plasma\nsource. The characterization data reported later were ob-\ntained from as grown materials without postgrowth anneal-\ning. However some in situ annealing may have occurred dur-\ning the growth of the p+ GaAs cladding, which was\nmaintained at 590 \u00b0C.\nSome of the measurements carried out in this work had\nto be performed on fabricated devices. Circular mesa diodes\nwith diameters of 400, 200, 100 and 50 \u0001m were fabricated\nusing standard photolithography and wet chemical etching.\nTop annular p-type Ohmic contacts \u0001Au-Zn-Au\u0002 were depos-\nited to allow optical access and n-type Ohmic contact\n\u0001In-Ge-Au\u0002 was deposited onto the back of the substrates. To\navoid unintentional postgrowth annealing, the metal contacts\nwere annealed at \u0003360 \u00b0C, which is well below the growth\ntemperature of Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y used in this work.\nIII. X-RAY ROCKING CURVES AND\nPHOTOLUMINESCENCE\nX-ray double crystal rocking curves \u0001theta\/2 theta scans\u0002\ndiffracted off the \u0001004\u0002 plane were measured on the as-grown\nwafers. The thin AlAs layer, a material usually considered\nlattice matched to GaAs, in the structures consistently gave a\nbroad peak with peak splitting of ~\u2212330 arc sec, which is\nexpected from the AlAs layer thickness and the lattice con-\nstant, for all three wafers. The peak splitting values between\nthe Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y peak and the GaAs substrate peak mea-\nsured near the center of wafers A, B, and C were found to be\n\u0003136, \u000374, and \u0003108 arc sec \u0001tensile strain\u0002, corresponding\nto lattice mismatch \u0001or strain\u0002 of \u22125.3\u000210\u22124, \u22122.9\u000210\u22124,\nand \u22124.2\u000210\u22124, respectively. These values, summarized in\nTable II, are small compared to the \u0004540 arc sec peak split-\nting in Ref. 6 and the lattice mismatch of 0.26% in Ref. 5.\nFrom critical layer thickness estimates,16 we believe there is\nno significant relaxation in our samples.\nAn x-ray rocking curve near the center of wafer C is\nshown in Fig. 1. Analysis of the x-ray peak splitting17 \u0001as-\nsuming negligible relaxation in the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers\u0002\nwas carried out to deduce the nitrogen content.

Phys. 101, 064506 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nfers\u0002. Vegard\u2019s law was then used to linearly interpolate the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer lattice constant, a, from the lattice\nconstants of the four binaries, aGaAs, aInAs, aInN, and aGaN to\ngive value for x.\nUsing a nitrogen content of 3.8%, fitting to the measured\nx-ray rocking curve of wafer C is in agreement with the\nexperimental data, as shown in Fig. 1. Similar interpretations\nof the x-ray rocking curves obtained near the centers of wa-\nfers A and B yielded nitrogen contents of 1.4% and 3.0%,\nrespectively. These nitrogen contents are also summarized in\nTable II.\nThe linewidth of the x-ray peak of the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nlayer provides a qualitative indication of crystal quality. The\npeaks due to the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y and the GaAs have line-\nwidths of 41 and 13 arc sec \u0001compared to 9 arc sec from\nsimulations for a GaAs substrate\u0002, respectively, for wafer C,\nwhere nitrogen content of 3.8% was achieved. This compares\nfavorably to the \u000355 arc sec for a much lower nitrogen con-\ntent of 0.55% reported in Ref. 14.\nNext, room temperature photoluminescence measure-\nments were performed on the as-grown wafers to estimate\nthe band gap of the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers in the wafers.\nThe photoluminescence from the wafers due to excitation by\n532 nm wavelength light was dispersed by a 0.5 m spectrom-\neter and detected by a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium de-\ntector. The wavelength at which the photoluminescence\npeaked was used to give the band gap of the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers. Due to the presence of the AlAs\nlayer and the strong luminescence from the heavily doped\nGaAs layers on either side of the GaInNAs layer, significant\ncavity resonance peaks were seen in the photoluminescence\nspectra making it difficult to obtain any further information\nother than the peak position.\nIn both the x-ray rocking curve and photoluminescence\nmeasurements, the splitting between the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nlayer and the GaAs substrate peaks as well as the photolu-\nminescence peak wavelength were found to vary radially\nacross the wafers. These variations translate into variation in\nnitrogen content and hence band gap of the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nlayer across a single wafer. The nonuniformity across the\nwafers \u0001with highest nitrogen content at the centers of the\nwafers\u0002 is attributed to the positioning of the nitrogen plasma\nsource used in our growth system.\nFigure 2 shows how the band gap \u0001deduced from peak\nphotoluminescence wavelengths\u0002 and x-ray peak splitting\nvalue vary across wafers B and C. It can be observed from\nFig. 2 that the peak splitting changes from positive values\ntoward the wafer center, which correspond to the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer being in tensile strain, to negative val-\nues toward wafer edge, which correspond to the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer being in compressive strain.\nMoving from the wafer edge to the wafer center, the\nchange in sign and magnitude of the peak splitting values, as\nshown on the right-hand axis, corresponds to an increasing\nnitrogen content and hence decreasing band gap in the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers, as shown on the left-hand axis. As-\nsuming that the change in lattice mismatch seen in Fig. 2 is\ndue to the variation in nitrogen content alone, it is estimated\nto vary from 3.8% to 2.6% as we move from the center to\nedge across wafer C. Nevertheless, the absolute range of\npeak splitting in the x-ray rocking curves across the wafers is\nrelatively small and hence the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers used\nin this work are considered nominally lattice-matched to\nGaAs.\nIV. ELECTRICAL CHARACTERIZATION\nThe regions of the three wafers, on which x-ray data\nwere described earlier, were then fabricated into devices for\nsubsequent characterization. The estimated nitrogen contents\nand band gaps for the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers in the three\nwafers are as given in Table II.\nTo assess the unintentional doping concentration in the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers, capacitance-voltage characteristics\nwere measured on these devices using a HP4275 LCR meter.\nThe measured capacitance-voltage characteristics of\ndifferent-sized devices scaled with device area. In addition,\nno significant frequency dependence was observed over a\nmeasurement frequency range from 10 kHz to 4 MHz, indi-\ncating that the measured capacitance was not affected by\ncarrier trapping in the depleted regions. Doping concentra-\ntions in the unintentional doped Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers were\nestimated from the measured capacitance-voltage character-\nistics, using Poisson\u2019s equation and assuming simple one-\nsided depletion.\nDue to the undesirable effects of Debye blurring on the\ndoping concentration profile, capacitance-voltage measure-\nments were repeated at 77 K and the estimated doping con-\ncentration profiles for the three wafers are shown in Fig. 3.\nDevices were slightly forward-biased up to \u00031 V so that\ncomplete doping concentration profiles for the unintentional\ndoped Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers were obtained. It can be seen\nfrom Fig. 3 that the unintentional doping concentrations drop\nrapidly to ~1014\u20131015cm\u22123 away from the highly doped clad-\nding layers. Such a low unintentional doping concentration\nenables full depletion of the 0.4 \u0001m thick Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nlayers with only the built-in electric field. Hence, zero exter-\nnal voltage operation is possible for photodiodes made with\nnarrow band gap Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers. This is also an at-\ntractive attribute for solar cells.

Both forward and reverse dark currents scaled\nwith the device areas for all wafers, except for reverse\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of wafer A, because the device\ndark currents of wafer A were below the lower measurement\nlimit of the setup. The forward current-voltage characteristics\nshowed an ideality factor of approximately 1.5 at low for-\nward voltages for all wafers, indicating that both diffusion\nand recombination currents are significant.\nThe reverse current densities versus electric field of the\nthree wafers are compared in Fig. 4. The electric field was\nestimated by assuming an ideal p\u2212 i\u2212n diode structure, the\nnominal i\u2212Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer thickness and a built-in\nvoltage of 1 V. The sudden increase in current density for\nwafer A at 340 kV\/cm is due to avalanche breakdown. The\nlower breakdown field for wafer A than wafers B and C is\nexpected due to its much thicker i region. The lowest reverse\ncurrent density data reported by Ref. 5, which were mea-\nsured on a Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212ySb p\u2212 i\u2212n diode wafer with a\nband gap and an i region thickness very similar to those of\nwafer C, are also plotted in Fig. 4 for comparison.\nIt is clear from Fig. 4 that the reverse current character-\nistics of wafer C is significantly lower than the lowest re-\nported in the literature.5 Recent data of a Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\np\u2212 i\u2212n diode,7 again very similar to wafer C in terms of\nband gap and i region thickness, are significantly higher than\nthe data of this work, as shown in Fig. 4. The significantly\nlower reverse leakage currents in our samples are attributed\nto better lattice matching to GaAs of our quaternary\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers compared to those in Refs. 5 and 7.\nIt can be observed from Fig. 4 that our reverse current-\nvoltage characteristics increase rapidly with nitrogen content\nin the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer. The shape of the reverse\ncurrent-voltage characteristic is also unusual. For a p\u2212 i\u2212n\ndiode, the two main mechanisms for bulk reverse leakage\ncurrents, namely diffusion and generation, generally do not\nincrease significantly with reverse voltage. Note that the re-\nverse electric fields shown in Fig. 4 are too low for band-to-\nband tunneling to be significant. If the observed trend in dark\ncurrent continued, a further significant increase in nitrogen\ncontent could result in unacceptably large reverse currents\nfor photodiodes.\nThe unusual increase in reverse dark current density with\nelectric field observed in Fig. 4 may be caused by defects in\nthe Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layers, which may exist as trapping lev-\nels in the forbidden gap. The defect density may increase\nwith the nitrogen content, leading to higher trap-assisted tun-\nneling current density. The difference in Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nband gaps in wafers B and C may not be large enough to\ncause difference in slope of reverse dark current increase\nwith electric field.\nV. ELECTROLUMINESCENCE AND PHOTOCURRENT\nRoom temperature electroluminescence from the devices\ndescribed earlier was also measured to confirm the values of\nthe Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y band gap deduced from photolumines-\ncence data. The surface normal electroluminescence from\nforward-biased devices was collected and detected using the\nsame setup used for photoluminescence measurements.\nThe data for wafers A, B, and C, obtained under an\nidentical forward current density of 64 A\/cm2, are shown in\nFig. 5. Electroluminescence peak wavelengths are 970 nm\n\u00011.28 eV\u0002, 1196 nm \u00011.04 eV\u0002, and 1276 nm \u00010.97 eV\u0002, with\nfull width at half maxima \u0001FWHM\u0002 values of 37, 51, and 51\nmeV, for wafers A, B, and C, respectively. The data of elec-\ntroluminescence and photoluminescence gave consistent val-\nues of peak wavelength for the three wafers, confirming the\naccuracy of the band gap values used in this work.\nWe obtained further electroluminescence data from a\nGaAs p\u2212 i\u2212n diode at room temperature using the same ex-\nperimental setup. FWHM of 44 meV was measured at room\ntemperature, which is in good agreement with the lower limit\ndue to thermal distribution of carrier energy \u000145 meV\u0002.18\nWhile wafers B and C have electroluminescence FWHM val-\nues close to that of GaAs p\u2212 i\u2212n diode, wafer A exhibits a\nFIG. 3.

This may be due to additional reflections at\nwavelengths coinciding with one of the optical cavity modes\n\u0001discussed later\u0002 in wafer A.\nHowever, increasing nitrogen content in the\nGa1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer leads to a significant reduction of\nelectroluminescence intensity, as shown in Fig. 5, indicating\ndegradation of the optical quality of the devices. The optical\nand electrical \u0001as observed in increased reverse dark current\u0002\ndegradation with increasing nitrogen content used in the wa-\nfers suggests the presence of nitrogen-related growth defects.\nThe usefulness of a wafer for photodiode applications is\nusually characterized by its responsivity, given by the ratio of\nphotocurrent to incident optical power, versus wavelength.\nHence, photocurrent measurements as function of wave-\nlength were carried out on our devices. Note that the photo-\ncurrent and electroluminescence measurements were per-\nformed on the same devices for all three wafers to ensure\nconsistency.\nSpectrally dispersed light from a tungsten bulb and a\nmonochromator was shone onto the device optical window\n\u0001again using the same three pieces for wafers A, B, and C\u0002. A\nphase-sensitive detection technique was used to measure the\nphotocurrent in the presence of dark currents. The incident\noptical power was measured using an EG&G C30665\nIn0.53Ga0.47As photodiode. Responsivity curves as a function\nof wavelength for wafers A, B, and C at reverse voltages of\n0 and 2 V are compared in Fig. 6, together with that of the\nC30665 photodiode for reference. Responsivity measure-\nments were also carried out for an in-house GaAs homojunc-\ntion p\u2212 i\u2212n diode with 0.5 \u0001m thick i region grown on n+\nGaAs substrate. The data obtained for reverse voltages of 0\nand 2 V are also shown in Fig. 6.\nFor our wafers, the values of the absorption band edge\ngiven by the responsivity curves agree with data of electrolu-\nminescence and photoluminescence. Significantly, the re-\nsponsivity curves of a given wafer for the two reverse volt-\nages used are very similar. This is expected from the low,\nunintentional doping concentration in the Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\nlayer because it is already fully depleted at zero external\nvoltage.\nAt a reverse voltage of 2 V, wafers A, B, and C have\nresponsivities of 0.24 \u00011.28 eV\u0002, 0.13 \u00011.04 eV\u0002, and 0.11\n\u00010.97 eV\u0002 A\/W, respectively. These values compare well with\nthe reported values of 0.097 A\/W \u0001Ref. 5\u0002 and 0.016A\/W\n\u0001Ref. 7\u0002 at 0.95 eV. Optical absorption up to a photon wave-\nlength of \u00031.38 \u0001m was detected in wafer C, an as-grown\nantimony-free Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y p\u2212 i\u2212n diode structure. The\nresponsivity should be improved by employing antireflection\ncoatings and increasing the i region thickness. Assuming the\nnominal total Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y layer thicknesses \u0001including\nthe p- and n-doped Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y cladding layers\u0002, optical\npower reflection loss of 32% from air to semiconductor and\nno other internal mechanisms for loss of carrier, absorption\ncoefficients are calculated to be in the region of 4\u0002103 \u0001at\n1.28 eV\u0002, 5\u0002103 \u0001at 1.04 eV\u0002, and 3\u0002103 \u0001at 0.97 eV\u0002\ncm\u22121, for wafers A, B, and C, respectively. These roughly\nobtained values are within an order of magnitude below\nthose of In0.53Ga0.47As for the same photon energies.19\nFringes can be observed in the responsivity spectra\nshown in Fig. 6 and they are attributed to the optical cavity\nformed between the air and the 100 nm AlAs layer. Assum-\ning that Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y has the same refractive index as\nthat of GaAs \u00013.6\u0002, the spacing between the fringes yields\ncavity length values of 3500, 1425, and 1420 nm, for wafers\nA, B, and C, respectively. These values are close to the\nnominal values of semiconductor layer thickness above the\nAlAs layer in wafers A \u00013400 nm\u0002, B \u00011300 nm\u0002, and C\n\u00011300 nm\u0002.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated high quality Ga1\u2212xInxNyAs1\u2212y\np\u2212 i\u2212n diodes lattice matched to GaAs with low uninten-\ntional doping concentration of ~1014 cm\u22123, low reverse cur-\nrents and an absorption edge down to 0.97 eV in a device\nwith a responsivity of 0.11 A\/W. This combination of desir-\nable attributes was achieved without postgrowth annealing or\naddition of antimony.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council \u0001EPSRC\u0002 for funding\nthe work.\nFIG. 5.
