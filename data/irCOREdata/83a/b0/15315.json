Their makers invested a great deal of effort\ninto the design of their goods, whose consumers expected stoves to be both visually attractive and useful. There was an\nenormous variety of stove models and increasingly rapid superficial change but also technological convergence and stylistic\nconsensus. The article explores this apparent paradox and explains it by focusing on the comparatively few men who designed\nmost American stoves in the industry\u2019s heyday.\nIN 1861, Jeremiah Dwyer (b. 1837), an ambi-tious young iron molder and labor activist, ac-quired a small foundry in Detroit in partnership\nwith his brother James (b. 1842), also a journeyman\nmolder, and with one of the business\u2019s previous\nowners. They were the city\u2019s first specialized stove\nmakers, laying the foundations of what quickly would\nbecome one of Detroit\u2019s leading industries until\novertaken by automobile manufacturing in the mid-\n1900s. At first their scale of operations was tiny: the\nbrothers built one stove per day and sold them\ndirectly to local customers. But they began to thrive\nafter securing the backing of a local hardware mer-\nchant and military contractor, William Tefft (b. 1819),\nwho bought everything they could make to help\nsatisfy the huge demand for stoves during the Civil\nWar boom. Tefft soon bought out the Dwyers\u2019 part-\nner, too, and together with another local merchant,\nMerrill Mills (also b. 1819), transformed the pro-\nprietary firm into a joint-stock company in 1864.\nThis was incorporated as the Detroit Stove Works\nin 1866, with a capitalization of $100,000, half\nof it paid in at the outset. The new enterprise\nunited the Dwyer brothers\u2019 practical experience\nand managerial skills with the marketing abilities\nand deep pockets of their senior partners, who\nput up four-fifths of the capital and whose families\nkept a controlling interest in the company for de-\ncades thereafter.2\n2 Robert B.

All rights reserved. 0084-0416\/2009\/4304-0004$10.00\nThe Detroit Stove Works immediately began a\nprocess of continuous investment, on which would\ndepend its rapid advance to become one of the larg-\nest companies in the industry. To succeed, Detroit\nStove had to claim a growing share of an already\ncrowded market and draw retailers\u2019 and consumers\u2019\nattention away from the old, established New York\nstate firms that had dominated the Midwestern trade\nuntil then. The way it aimed to do this was by spend-\ning heavily from day one and going straight to the\nnation\u2019s most experienced and prolific stove pattern\nmaker, Nicholas Vedder (b. 1820), of Troy, New\nYork, to provide it with a competitive, up-to-the-\nminute product line right from the outset. The pat-\nterns he sold to the company were both the most\nimportant tools of the stove molder\u2019s trade, vital to\nthe production of high-quality castings, and also the\nphysical embodiments of the intellectual property\nVedder had created in his innovative, patent-\nprotected stove designs.\nThe young company\u2019s key strategic priority\nwas deciding on the patterns to buy or commission,\nfrom Vedder and other sources. In the beginning,\nWilliam Tefft, now its president, and works manager\nJeremiah Dwyer shared the responsibility. But the\nentire board soon entered into careful, extensively\nminuted discussions of even small design details,\nwith a degree of attention that they rarely devoted to\nanything else. This was surely because getting the\nproduct line right was crucial to everything else and\npatterns represented such a large outlay: in 1866,\n$9,955 of the corporation\u2019s assets\u2014more than half\nof its fixed capital\u2014as against just $2,547 for its\nmachinery and other tools. They made up $16,600\n(almost half) of the additions to equipment in the\nfirst full year. By the time of its third annual report,\nthe Detroit Stove Works\u2019 investment in patterns\nequaled its buildings, machinery, and tools in value.\nThis situation changed little thereafter in this skill-\nintensive, relatively unmechanized business. Year\nin, year out, in booms and recessions alike, Detroit\nStove spent heavily to build up and maintain an\never-changing and widening range of cooking and\nheating stoves to suit the varied needs of its demand-\ning customers. This was not a matter of choice,\nbecause all of its competitors were doing the same;\nindeed, they had been doing so for decades.3\nThe story of the Detroit Stove Works\u2019 begin-\nnings highlights the importance of product design,\nrepresented in the costly wood and iron offspring\nof the pattern maker\u2019s agile mind and dexterous\nhand, to entrepreneurial success in the stove trade.\nStovemaking was a pioneer among the emerging\nconsumer durables industries and already a ma-\nture trade by the time the Dwyers determined to\ncross the thin line separating its artisans from its\nentrepreneurs. Stoves were the most significant\nnew domestic technology before the introduction\nof gas and electricity to the American home and\nsome of the costliest, as well as most commonplace,\nhousehold objects of the age. Demand and pro-\nduction surged through the industry\u2019s first forty\nyears, manufacturers multiplied, and their products\nevolved rapidly in a process of intensely competitive\ninvention and imitation. Stoves were at one and the\nsame time objects of utility and of decoration, and\nmanufacturers worked hard at developing their prod-\nucts along both dimensions to satisfy consumers\u2019\ndiverse and increasingly exacting requirements. They\npenetrated a majority of non-Southern homes be-\ntween the industry\u2019s origins in the 1820s and 1830s\nand the Civil War and flooded into the South, the\ntrade\u2019s last frontier, once the war was over. Over a mil-\nlion units were made and sold in 1860, more than\ntwo million by 1870\u2014one new stove for every nine-\nteen American people or every fourth household.4\nThis was an industry where design was critically\nimportant, both to perfect the product and help\nboost demand and in order to assist makers in miti-\ngating the rigors of the market that they created.\nFor the latter purpose, they became unusually de-\npendent on the patent system\u2014at first just for \u2018\u2018im-\nprovements\u2019\u2019 but after 1842, when the law began to\npermit it, for designs, too. Stoves made up about a\ntenth of all U.S. invention patents in the late 1830s\nand mid-1840s, the industry\u2019s first two growth peaks,\nand about 70 percent of design patents in the new\ndispensation\u2019s first couple of decades. Inventors, pat-\ntern makers, and manufacturers devised, traded in,\nand vigorously defended intellectual property rights\n3 For pattern buying, see Detroit Stove Works Minute Book,\nApril 25, 1866, 9; March 20, 1867, 30; April 18, 1867, 32; February\n15, 1868, 53\u201356; February 25, 1869, 79; March 18, 1870, 112\u201313;\nMarch 8, 1871, 142\u201343; for pattern account, see July 7, 1866, 13;\nJanuary 12, 1868, 48; July 17, 1868, 61; July 30, 1869, 94; and Jan-\nuary 1, 1888, 302. \u2018\u2018Detroit Stove Works\u2014Largest Establishment in\nthe City\u2019\u2019 (Detroit Commercial Bulletin, July 20, 1871, http:\/\/www.\nmyantiquestove.com\/history\/detroit-stove-works-largest) describes\nthe company\u2019s new factory built to accommodate its rapid growth,\nincluding its \u2018\u2018sanctum,\u2019\u2019 the small pattern shop, where, the author\nincorrectly claimed, \u2018\u2018all the new styles of stoves so frequently intro-\nduced by the Detroit Stove Works Company, have been invented,\u2019\u2019\nairbrushing Vedder and less celebrated suppliers out of the picture\nin order to establish the company\u2019s claim to creative originality.\n4 Howell J.

It also\nexploits correspondence among consumers, distrib-\nutors, and manufacturers to illuminate that other\ndriver of the design process\u2014articulate feedback\nfrom the market itself. This essay will explain why\nan unceasing search for product differentiation in a\ncompetitive and imitative industry, and the pressures\non individual manufacturers to satisfy a common set\nof consumer expectations, resulted in a situation\nwhere any one stove was in all essentials, and even in\nsuperficial appearance, much like any other.\nForm Follows Function: The Evolution of the\nAmerican Stove\nThe nineteenth century cast-iron stove for cooking\nand space heating was a product that assumed a\nrecognizably mature form between the late 1830s\nand the early 1850s, at the same time that a special-\nized industry dedicated to its manufacture emerged.\nThe midcentury stove was a development from three\ncolonial and early national Pennsylvania stove types:\nthe six plate (for room heating), ten plate (for heat-\ning and cooking), and the celebrated but imprac-\ntical and commercially unsuccessful Franklin stove\nand its simplified, more salable successors\u2014initially\nintended just for room heating but later adapted for\ncooking, too (fig. 1). Unlike the humble cannon\nstove, for heating public spaces, and later hot-air\nfurnaces, hidden away in the basement, the prin-\ncipal members of the stove family were never purely\nutilitarian objects. They had to take their place in\nthe parlors, and later the kitchens, of the predomi-\nnantly wealthy households who were the early adopt-\ners of this new and initially costly technology. So their\nmakers strove to transform these heavy, bulky, black\nobjects into acceptable items of furniture.\nFor this purpose stove makers relied on cast\niron\u2019s ease of decoration. Any design that could be\ncarved or fixed upon the wooden boards from which\nstove-plate patterns were made would translate itself\ninto low relief on the finished casting\u2019s outer surface.\nSimple decoration also served a functional purpose:\nit disguised some of the imperfections unavoidable\nwhen casting stove plate in the sand or dirt floors of\nthe country blast furnaces that produced it from the\ncolonial period until the 1830s. Stove pattern mak-\ners selected from a limited palette of familiar floral,\nnaturalistic, or patriotic decorative motifs and added\nmakers\u2019 or furnace names and dates as permanent\nadvertisements to craft everyday objects for prosper-\nous federal-era households up and down the East\nCoast from Baltimore to Maine (figs. 2\u20133).5\nFig. 1.

The best historical evidence for\nthis, apart from surviving stoves themselves, is pro-\nvided by the U.S. Patent Office record. A trickle\nof stove patents turned into a steady stream in the\n1830s, with inventors, designers, and makers con-\ncentrating their efforts on increasing stoves\u2019 useful-\nness as heating and particularly as cooking devices\nand on constructing and perfecting stoves to use the\nnew wonder fuel of the urban East Coast, Pennsyl-\nvania anthracite (fig. 4).6\nAt this time, makers, sellers, and users seem to\nhave valued stoves\u2019 functionality much more than\ntheir appearance. Advertisements and reports fo-\ncused on utilitarian features, with looks distinctly\nsecondary. Patent drawings, particularly for cook-\ning stoves, were generally unadorned or displayed\na few applied decorative motifs on otherwise plain\nsurfaces (fig. 5). Forty years later the editor of the\nMetal Worker, an informed commentator, described\nthem as \u2018\u2018so utterly devoid of ornament that they\nwere little more than cast or sheet iron boxes.\u2019\u20197 But\nappearance was not altogether neglected.

The most important\ndevelopments were the industry\u2019s restructuring and\nrelocation and the beginning of its rapid growth.\nBriefly, through the early to mid 1830s, stove-plate\ncasting remained tied to rural blast furnaces, par-\nticularly those of southeastern Pennsylvania and\nsouthern New Jersey. Stove assembly, distribution,\nand marketing meanwhile relied on \u2018\u2018manufactur-\ners\u2019\u2019 and dealers quartered in commercial cities and\ntowns along the eastern seaboard from Baltimore\nnorthward and on navigable waterways stretching\ndeep into the interior.\nAfter the mid 1830s, several things began to\nhappen in rapid sequence. First of all, major urban\ndealers increasingly commissioned their own de-\nsigns, rather than just buying stoves cast from the\nfurnaces\u2019 own patterns. They thereby raised the rate\nof innovation and the likelihood of a rapid response\nto signals from an increasingly experienced, de-\nmanding, and competitive market. Next, the deal-\ners began to integrate backward into stove-plate\ncasting too, bringing the entire design and manu-\nfacturing process onto one site under unified pro-\nprietary control and producing agglomerations of\nspecialized stove foundries in Baltimore, Philadel-\nphia, New York City, Boston, and, in particular,\nAlbany and Troy, New York, at the head of tidal\nnavigation on the Hudson River and the eastern\nterminus of the Erie Canal. These foundries also\nbegan to develop improved techniques for the pro-\nduction of cheaper, lighter, more durable, and more\nattractive goods through a transformative process of\n\u2018\u2018learning by doing,\u2019\u2019 during which they also devel-\noped their own skilled, specialized labor force.9\nThe principal identifiable pioneer was Jordan\nMott, a stove dealer-turned-manufacturer of New\nYork City, who perfected in the 1830s \u2018\u2018a light,\nsmooth, sharp cut, and elegant style of stove plate\nin place of the rough castings of the blast furnace\npreviously used. By studying the effects of irregular\nexpansion by heat he was able to overcome the\ntendency to strain and crack by a change in the\nform of the plates, that is by panelling, curving, or\nfluting them.\u2019\u201910 Mott\u2019s aim was to make a cheaper\nand better-quality product, permitting him to real-\nize his ambitions for his stoves as mass-, rather than\nniche-market, goods. For him, \u2018\u2018ornament [was]\nmerely a thing of fancy, or taste,\u2019\u2019 but his and oth-\ners\u2019 innovations in design and manufacturing tech-\nnique over the next decade would also enable stove\nfounders to batch-produce stoves that were more\nvisually attractive as well as more functional and\naffordable than before.11 The best evidence of this\nis provided by surviving artifacts themselves, espe-\ncially heating stoves destined for the middle-class\nparlor. Between the early 1830s and the mid 1840s,\nthe widespread adoption of Mott\u2019s and others\u2019 inno-\nvations encouraged designers to cover their prod-\nucts with a plethora of classical, ecclesiastical gothic,\nromantic, and other motifs from architects\u2019 and\nwoodcarvers\u2019 pattern books.\nSeveral key technical developments facilitated\nthis stylistic change. The use of the cupola furnace\nfor melting pig iron and scrap produced a hotter,\ncleaner, more fluid metal, improving surface finish\nand the ability to faithfully reproduce fine detail.12\nThe replacement of open sand by flask casting per-\nmitted more elaborately decorated surfaces, great-\ner variations in contour and shape, and movement\naway from the slab-sided aesthetic of traditional\nstove plate (fig. 7).13 Finally, there was a radical\ntransformation in patternmaking practice. The\ndominant style of the 1800s\u20131820s relied on build-\ning up patterns on flat boards by pinning or gluing\n9 Harris, \u2018\u2018Inventing the U.S. Stove Industry.\u2019\u2019\n10 J.

At the top of the price\nrange, the columnar parlor stoves popular in the\n1830s and 1840s were the ultimate expression of\nthe unprecedented design freedom offered by the\ncombination of new patternmaking and foundry\ntechniques (fig. 9). The first stove design patent\u2014\nEzra Ripley\u2019s D5 of 1843\u2014was for a column flue\nmade to look like a dolphin (of a rather fishy\ncharacter; it had scales). Ripley emphasized that\nhis flue could be molded \u2018\u2018in one piece including\nthe base, the shaft and the capital,\u2019\u2019 rather than\nneeding to be built up; a considerable saving, as\nwell as being aesthetically much neater and less\nlikely to leak smoke into the room through the\njoints between plates. Column stoves adopted a\nconfident new look all their own, dominating as\nwell as efficiently heating their owners\u2019 finest rooms\nwith vast lumps of polished iron in a bewilderingly\neclectic variety of styles\u2014including floral, rococo,\nand \u2018\u2018Egyptian,\u2019\u2019 as well as all of those already men-\ntioned, sometimes curiously intermixed on the same\nproud object. Now, at last, the stove could com-\npete with the open fire and its elaborate mantel as a\nsuitable centerpiece for the living spaces of the mid-\ndle and upper classes (fig. 10). The industry\u2019s\nincreasingly efficient techniques of large-batch man-\nufacture quickly permitted the democratization of\nthis new fashion, making cheaper and simplified\nFig. 8.

George\nWallis, principal of the Birmingham (England) Col-\nlege of Design and a specialist in the application of\nthe decorative arts to industry, gave a mixed verdict\non the products of the U.S. foundry trade in his\ncelebrated 1854 report on the New York Industrial\nExhibition. Quality was high: products were \u2018\u2018admira-\nble, alike for the purity of surface in the material,\nand the skill shown in the moulding. The iron . . . is\nof a firm quality and closer grain . . . than that used\nfor similar work in England. Hence the castings pro-\nduced are sharp in detail and even in surface, and\nrequire a very small amount of dressing or filing to\ncomplete them.\u2019\u2019 But stoves were singled out for par-\nticular condemnation because of their looks: though\ndesigns were sometimes appropriate, there was \u2018\u2018a\nwide field for a better style than as yet prevails, . . .\nthe ornamentation adopted often partakes of the\ncharacter of an excrescence rather than of a deco-\nrative adjunct.\u2019\u2019 Stoves shared the general failure\nWallis perceived in the design of American con-\nsumer products\u2014they were derivative and taste-\nless, full of \u2018\u2018errors committed in a vague seeking\nafter novelty.\u2019\u2019 What Wallis especially disliked was\nwhat consumers evidently wanted, or what design-\ners and makers thought that they wanted: a design\naesthetic supposedly at odds with the material of\nwhich stoves and other decorative cast-iron prod-\nucts were manufactured, \u2018\u2018suggesting any other\nmaterial than that of which the article is really com-\nposed.\u2019\u2019 Wallis was not as severe as other contem-\nporary critics: the conservative Southern intellectual\nGeorge Fitzhugh found stoves\u2019 \u2018\u2018alto-relievo cast-\ning . . . ugly and contemptible.\u2019\u2019 But, fortunately for\nthe industry\u2019s prospects, its hundreds of thousands\nof customers did not seem to share this lofty disdain\nfor its ability to bring the benefits of mass production\nto the household while catering to common tastes\n(or the absence of \u2018\u2018taste\u2019\u2019) with its cast-iron versions\nof carpenter gothic (or baroque, classical, Egyptian,\nor rococo).17\nWhen stove designers attempted to describe\ntheir work in patent applications, words understand-\nably failed them quite often\u2014there was no lan-\nguage adequate for their stylistic inventiveness, and\nfavored adjectives like \u2018\u2018bold\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018fancy\u2019\u2019 did not get\nthem very far, however frequently repeated.18\nFor example, what is one to make of William\nAbendroth\u2019s (Port Chester, New York) 1858 cook-\nstove design D1044?

They re-\nflect the work of a growing community of stove\nmakers, well aware of one another\u2019s experiments\nbecause most of them lived and traded in the same\nfew urban centers and also because of the role that\nthe emerging technical press and trade fairs played\nin the dissemination of information among them.\nThese men were in equal measures very competi-\ntive with and highly imitative of one another.\nFig. 10.

(U.S. Patent\nand Trademark Office.)\n19 General Pitman\u2019s identity is unknown; presumably he was a\nhero of the Revolutionary War or the War of 1812, whose exploit\nAbendroth evidently expected to be familiar to his buyers.\nDesigning the First Mass-Market Consumer Durable 375\nA more or less original design\u2014Henry Stanley\u2019s\nrotary-top cooking stove of 1832 (patent 7333X)\nor Philo Stewart\u2019s Summer and Winter Airtight\nCooking Stove of 1838 (patent 915)\u2014that turned\ninto a successful new product was a rarity. Most\ninventors contented themselves instead with minor\nmodifications of or improvements on existing de-\nsigns and addressed a common set of functional\nproblems bedeviling all stove makers and users. In\ncookstoves, which absorbed the lion\u2019s share of in-\nventive effort, these included enlarging the size of\nthe oven, equalizing heat distribution within it, in-\ncreasing the cooking surface on top, improving\ncontrollability and fuel economy, and adding such\nuseful extras as warming closets or water boilers uti-\nlizing what would otherwise have been waste heat.20\nWhat mattered was to be able to claim just\nenough usefulness, novelty, and distinctiveness to\npersuade a patent examiner to confer an intellec-\ntual property right and a court to compel others to\nrespect it. The resulting microinventions were\nnevertheless highly valued by those who created\nthem. When inventor-manufacturers turned their\nideas into a merchantable stove, the patent claim\ntranslated directly into a unique sales proposi-\ntion, distinguishing it from the host of rival prod-\nucts in the market, adding value, and protecting\nits maker from head-to-head competition on price\nalone. When they sold or licensed their intellec-\ntual property to another maker as a right to man-\nufacture and sell within a particular market, the\npatent served a similar purpose for the buyer as\nfor the original inventor, as well as creating an ad-\nditional source of revenue for the latter by way of\nroyalty payments.\nThe emerging stove industry became habitu-\nated to this approach to the commodification of\n\u2018\u2018improvements\u2019\u2019 almost from its beginning. Daniel\nPettibone, an itinerant Yankee inventor, had pointed\nthe way during the presidencies of Jefferson and\nMadison when he patented the first practicable\nwarm-air heating furnace for public buildings. The\nPennsylvania Hospital, Almshouse, and House of\nEmployment, the Philadelphia Bank, and eventu-\nally the White House and Capitol all had Pettibone\nfurnaces. He used elite endorsements to promote\nsales and the patent system to add further to his\nnovel appliances\u2019 credibility, as well as securing his\nmonopoly in their manufacture.21 Other leading\nstove inventors of the teens, 1820s, and 1830s fol-\nlowed the trail he had blazed as they developed\ntheir products for the kitchen and parlor and joined\nthe march toward the national mass market and\naway from the lofty urban and institutional niches\nwhere Pettibone had sought his profits.\nThe Golden Age of the Design Patent\nIn 1842, Congress amended the patent law in a way\nthat was uniquely favorable to stove makers, who\nrapidly seized on this opportunity. The close fit\nbetween the law\u2019s provisions and stove makers\u2019 ex-\nisting business practices and needs was probably\nFig. 11. Henry N.

Design pat-\nents also contributed more than 50 percent of the\ntotal number of stove patents (counting inventions\nand designs together) in every year bar one be-\ntween 1846 and 1857 and were still about a third of\nthe total by the start of the Civil War.\nHow are we to explain this singular exploita-\ntion of the new law\u2019s opportunities? George Wallis\nthought that the failure of other American indus-\ntries to take advantage of it was partly because most\nof them were derivative of European styles rather\nthan creative\u2014\u2018\u2018with the exception of [stoves] . . . it\nis difficult to suppose that much originality in de-\nsign could be legally claimed.\u2019\u2019 The U.S. patent ap-\nplication process also militated against the makers\nof the most style-dependent products, who had\nbeen among its intended or expected beneficiaries.\n\u2018\u2018In the majority of cases, copyright of design can\nonly be valuable to the manufacturer so far as it en-\nables him to secure to himself, by a rapid process,\nthe exclusive immediate use of his invention. . . .\nThe system of examination, with the delay in the deci-\nsion, as practised in the United States, would be fatal\nto the value of one-half the designs registered in Eng-\nland.\u2019\u201924 But the design and product-development\nprocesses in stovemaking were slow enough to ac-\ncommodate themselves to the U.S. patent system,\neven at the period when it was least responsive to\napplicants\u2019 needs.\nIt is possible to offer other reasonable specu-\nlations about why stove makers made so much use\nof the design patent law. Theirs was an industry\nthat had already incorporated more than any oth-\ners the existing invention patent system into its\ncompetitive (and anticompetitive) strategies. It was\nalso one whose products were becoming much\nmore elaborately decorated between the 1830s and\nearly 1840s. Manufacturers therefore had a growing\ninvestment in their distinctive designs and com-\npeted with one another increasingly on products\u2019\nappearance as well as on price, build quality, and\nutility, which is why Mott and the other petitioners\nhad sought Congress\u2019s help \u2018\u2018to secure the rights\nFig. 14.

They were already in the habit of mold-\ning makers\u2019 names and (invention) patent dates\nand even numbers onto their stoves\u2019 surfaces as key\nelements of the product\u2019s identity, so compliance\nwith the marking provision of the new law was par-\nticularly easy for them. But the casting process also\nmade it necessary for stove makers to attempt to\ndefend their investment in original and market-\nable designs with all of the resources of the law.\nThe same improved techniques that enabled stove\nmakers to accurately reproduce in iron their costly\nwooden master patterns and to use those metal\npatterns in large-batch production also made it all\ntoo tempting for a rival simply to buy a sample\nstove, take it apart, and use its plates as prototypes\nfor metal patterns of his own, with little loss of\nquality. Makers could state that their conditions of\nsale were that their stoves were \u2018\u2018for use as a Manu-\nfactured Article, and not as a Pattern to cast from\u2019\u2019\nuntil they were blue in the face, but words alone\nwere no defense. Pattern piracy was, and remained,\nrife.26\nBut probably the key reason why stove makers\ntook out so many design patents after the mid 1840s\nis that acquiring a \u2018\u2018utility\u2019\u2019 patent became relatively\nharder at the same time because of more frequent\nrejections by overworked patent examiners unable\nto detect any novelty in stove makers\u2019 flood of near-\nidentical microinventions. Thomas Jones, editor of\nthe Journal of the Franklin Institute, ex-commissioner\nof patents and a patent agent himself, expressed\nthis expert skepticism over and over again in his in-\nfluential reviews of new \u2018\u2018improvements\u2019\u2019: when the\ncelebrated Congregational minister Horace Bushnell\nstrayed into the field of stove invention, for example\n(patent 1177, 1839), Jones concluded that \u2018\u2018in the\nobject to be attained, there is here no novelty, and\nin the means of accomplishing it, just enough upon\nwhich to found a claim; with regard to utility, the\nsame amount of this has been obtained by anal-\nogous arrangements.\u2019\u2019 Of a new cooking stove (pa-\ntent 1352, 1839), he commented that \u2018\u2018any new\ncooking stove must, to a certain extent, nearly re-\nsemble many others.\u2019\u201927 Attitudes like these among\nexaminers made microinventions increasingly hard\nto patent; judges\u2019 and juries\u2019 difficulty in discerning\nthe novelty and utility of patents that did get regis-\ntered certainly made them more difficult to enforce\nand, thus, less valuable.28 Accordingly, the stove\nindustry\u2019s share of all patents for invention fell from\n9 percent in 1845 and 1846 to just 2\u20133 percent by\n1852\u201353 and for the rest of the 1850s, as a result\nof an absolute decline in the number of successful\nstove applications (e.g., nineteen in 1852 vs. fifty-\nthree in 1846), as well as an increase in the overall\nvolume of patenting.\nDesign patents were easier and cheaper to get,\npartly because no model was required, just a draw-\ning and brief specification. It was also less difficult\nto demonstrate their novelty or distinctiveness, so\nthat in 1852, for example, the rejection rate was\nless than one in six, whereas the comparable figure\nfor invention patents was about three in five. And\nthere was no test of utility to pass. Finally, they\nseemed to offer at least as good a legal defense\nagainst imitation. They thus served as a partial\nreplacement for, as well as a useful supplement to,\ninvention patents in this dynamic, competitive\n25 Senate Journal, March 2, 1842, 195.\n26 This is still the way in which owners of old stoves get re-\nplacement parts; Clifford Boram, How to Get Parts Cast for Your\nAntique Stove: Dealing with a Foundry Is Easier than You May Think\n(Monticello, IN: Autonomy House Publications, 1982), 1. It is not\nentirely unproblematic\u2014because of the shrinkage of molten iron\non cooling, iron production patterns should be slightly larger than\nthe parts they are designed to mold, and wooden master patterns a\nlittle larger again (the \u2018\u2018two shrinks\u2019\u2019 rule). There is thus some loss\nof accuracy in using a finished plate as an iron pattern, but nothing\na good fitter cannot cope with. Examples of conditions of sale from\nBurdett, Smith and Co.

Between 1830 and 1844,\nstove invention was a widespread activity across the\nnorthern states and seems to have involved relatively\nfew \u2018\u2018professional\u2019\u2019 inventors, that is, repeat patent-\nees. Of the 403 individuals responsible for the 513\ntraceable stove invention patents, just twenty (5 per-\ncent) took out more than two patents each during\nthis period, accounting for ninety-nine (18 per-\ncent) of the total; 350 registered only a single pat-\nent. Eliphalet Nott and Jordan Mott stood at the\nhead of the list, with eighteen patents each. Several\nother repeat patentees were also closely identified\nwith the emerging industry, and their innovative\ndesigns, rapidly imitated, would also make a sig-\nnificant contribution to product development. But\nstove invention was generally quite a \u2018\u2018democratic\u2019\u2019\nor at least grassroots activity, open to optimistic\namateur tinkerers. It was also apparently quite in-\ndividualistic: only twenty-seven patents were taken\nout jointly with another person, usually a family\nmember. Finally, stove patenting was not a par-\nticularly concentrated activity. The largest cities,\nwhere stove manufacturing and trading were\nfocused, commanded the lion\u2019s share, predictably\nenough, and these patents included almost all that\nbecame commercially important (table 1). But\nsmall-town mechanics across the northern states\nevidently also felt free to try to get in on the act,\nwith the result that patenting was probably less\nconcentrated than the emerging industry itself\n(table 2).\nThe contrast with design patents is quite stark.\nThe first notable fact about stove design patents is\nhow many of them there were: 806 between the\nyears 1845 and 1859 versus 681 invention patents.\nThis large figure reflects, but does not fully repre-\nsent, one of the mature stove industry\u2019s key char-\nacteristics: the enormous number of different stove\ntypes and models that firms produced and sold.\nThere were far more separate stove designs in pro-\nduction at any one time than there were design pat-\nents in force. Samuel Vose of Albany, New York, for\nexample, one of the most active design patentees,\nhad twenty-eight separate models in his 1853 cata-\nlog, more than his total number of design patents\nto date, but some of them shared the same pat-\nented features, or were adequately covered by in-\nvention patents instead, and others (cheaper, older,\nmore generic) were not patented at all.30 Stove de-\nsigns could also be (1) pirated, (2) lawfully copied\nonce the seven-year patent expired, or (3) assigned\nby the patent holder to other makers who engaged\nin \u2018\u2018badge engineering\u2019\u2019\u2014in other words, putting\ntheir own name on the stove\u2019s front plate but mak-\ning no other alterations\u2014and then sold the results,\nideally in a noncompeting market territory. The\ntotal number of genuinely distinctive stove designs\nin production and on sale at any particular time is\ntherefore impossible to calculate, but by the mid\n1870s, twenty-eight Albany and Troy firms\u2014less\nthan one-seventh of the industry\u2019s members\nbut with about one-fifth of production capacity\u2014\nreported 850 separate, named models, some of\nthem undoubtedly identical with one another.31\nOne hundred fifty firms, about three-quarters of\nthe national total, reported a similar average of\nroughly thirty models per company at the same\ntime. It would thus be reasonable to estimate that\nin the centennial year the stove industry presented\nAmerican consumers with at least 6,000 models of\ncooking stoves and ranges, heating stoves and fur-\nnaces, many of them available in a number of dif-\nferent sizes and with innumerable optional extras.32\nModel proliferation was the manufacturers\u2019 response\nto the heterogeneous demands of the consumers\nthey dealt with, but it undoubtedly added heavily to\nthe industry\u2019s patternmaking costs and the impor-\ntance that stove makers attached to design issues.\nThe second key fact is that stove design, cer-\ntainly as reflected in the patent record, was a much\nmore localized activity than stove inventing was or\n29 Delos W.

It was concentrated in a handful of\ncore states; New York state alone did more than\nhalf of the total business (table 3).\nAt the level of the city, the picture is even clearer\n(table 4). Stove design was a highly specialized ac-\ntivity, carried on by a handful of practitioners in\nmost of the industry\u2019s major production centers. It\nwas, however, far more concentrated in the New\nYork Capital District and other cities in the Hudson\nRiver\u2013Erie Canal corridor than was manufacturing\ncapacity itself. Each of the major stovemaking cities\nsupported small groups of dedicated designers\u2014\nsome of them also stove manufacturers, but the most\ninfluential among them were pattern makers pure\nand simple. Four men\u2014Samuel Gibbs and Samuel\nVose of Albany, New York; Nicholas Vedder of Troy,\nNew York; and Garretson Smith of Philadelphia\u2014\nwere each responsible for more than 5 percent of\ntotal stove design patents issued in the first fifteen\nyears of the law\u2019s operation. Together with Troy\u2019s\npioneering Ezra Ripley, they filed a quarter of them\nall. Just twenty men accounted for more than half of\nthe total\u2014or at least, theirs were the first names on\ndesign patents, for which they often shared author-\nship. Design patenting was a more collective enter-\nprise than stove inventing: more than a quarter\n(213) of design patents had at least two signatories\n(fifty-seven had three; six had four), indicating their\norigin in small design studios organized along\npartnership lines.\nThe final major difference between stove invent-\ning and designing was that design patents often\nbore evidence of their status as tradable intellectual\nproperty: they already included the names of the\nfirms to which they had been assigned, in other\nwords, by which they had been bought (fig. 16).\nStove inventions were the work of men (and a very\nfew women) who either intended to push them into\nproduction themselves or hoped to be able to sell\nthem to other manufacturers or to use them in the\ncourtroom (sometimes the most profitable option).\nAssignment was commonplace for successful patents,\nTable 1\nInvention Patents, 1830\u201344, by City\nNumber Percent of total Cumulative percent\nNew York 65 12.7\nBoston 33 6.5 19.2\nPhiladelphia 32 6.3 25.4\nSchenectady, NY* 21 4.1 29.5\nNew Haven, CT 17 3.3 32.9\nAlbany, NY 16 3.1 36.0\nTroy, NY 14 2.7 38.7\nCincinnati 11 2.2 40.9\nBaltimore 10 2.0 42.9\nPoultney, VTy 6 1.2 44.0\n*Residence of Eliphalet Nott.\nyResidence of Henry Stanley.\nTable 2\nInvention Patents, 1830\u201344, by State\nNumber Percent of total Cumulative percent\nNew York 188 36.8\nMassachusetts 85 16.6 53.4\nPennsylvania 56 11.0 64.4\nConnecticut 44 8.6 73.0\nOhio 27 5.3 78.3\nVermont 24 4.7 83.0\nNew Hampshire 24 4.7 87.7\nMaine 20 3.9 91.6\nMaryland 11 2.2 93.7\nNew Jersey 10 2.0 95.7\nDesigning the First Mass-Market Consumer Durable 383\nTable 3\nStove Patents, 1845\u201359, by State\nNumber Percent of total Cumulative percent\nDesigns:\nNew York 456 57\nPennsylvania 144 18 74\nOhio 77 10 84\nMassachusetts 51 6 90\nRhode Island 29 4 94\nNew Hampshire 19 2 96\nMaine 12 1 98\nConnecticut 5 1 98\nMaryland 4 0 99\nMissouri 3 0 99\nInventions:\nNew York 275 40\nPennsylvania 104 15 56\nMassachusetts 102 15 71\nOhio 61 9 80\nConnecticut 19 3 82\nMaryland 17 2 85\nNew Jersey 16 2 87\nVirginia 11 2 89\nWashington, DC 10 1 90\nVermont 9 1 92\nTable 4\nStove Patents, 1845\u201359, by City\nNumber Percent of total Cumulative percent\nDesigns:\nTroy, NY 167 21\nAlbany, NY 150 19 39\nPhiladelphia 136 17 56\nCincinnati 63 8 64\nNew York 55 7 71\nProvidence, RI 29 4 74\nBoston 27 3 78\nRochester, NY 18 2 80\nUtica, NY 15 2 82\nBuffalo, NY 14 2 84\nInventions:\nPhiladelphia 65 10\nNew York 64 9 19\nAlbany, NY 59 9 28\nBoston 51 7 35\nCincinnati 36 5 40\nTroy, NY 35 5 46\nBaltimore 15 2 48\nBrooklyn, NY 10 1 49\nWashington, DC 9 1 51\nLowell, MA 8 1 52\n384 Winterthur Portfolio 43:4\nbut the record of it is usually separate from the patent\ndocuments themselves; it only had to be recorded\nthere if the inventor\u2019s whole interest had been sold\nbefore the grant of the patent, which rarely hap-\npened. Stove designs were much less commonly\nspeculative in the same way. Design patents often\nrecord a process in which stove makers commis-\nsioned specialized pattern makers to produce a new\nmodel that would be as uniquely theirs as the law\nmade possible or whose subsequent use by other\nmanufacturers would in theory be theirs to control\nand profit from. The fact that so much of the stove\ntrade came to rely on a handful of designers for this\ncrucial service was another strong force driving the\nconvergence of the growing industry on products\nthat were increasingly similar in outward appearance\nas well as in internal arrangements and functionality.\nThe Master Pattern Makers\nThere are no surviving records from any of these\npattern shops, apart from the design patents (and\nsome resulting stoves) themselves. But contempo-\nrary business writer Edwin Freedley did publish a\nfew capsule biographies of some of the most influ-\nential proprietors. James Wager of Troy, New York,\nfor example (with an invention patent and nine-\nteen design patents to his credit between 1844 and\n1855), started out in 1835 as \u2018\u2018one of the first in\nthat section of the country to engage in supplying\nhome and distant manufacturers with choice stove\npatterns.\u2019\u2019 He followed in the trail blazed by Samuel\nHanley, \u2018\u2018who, in 1830, was the first in Troy . . . to\nclaim for his art the position of a distinct, regular\nbusiness.\u2019\u2019 Wager manufactured stoves himself and\nFig. 16.

In Phil-\nadelphia, \u2018\u2018competition . . . had not yet called for\nany very great degree of skill in the arts of design.\nPattern makers were usually able to satisfy their cus-\ntomers by copying with slight alterations the designs\nof other stoves.\u2019\u2019 But Smith and Brown \u2018\u2018determined\nto institute a new era, and the designs which they\noriginated attracted so much of the public favor to\nthose manufacturers who adopted them, that others\nwere induced to draw upon their inventive talent.\u2019\u201934\nNicholas Vedder was the most productive and\ninfluential of them all. One of his former ap-\nprentices, who went on to become a prominent pat-\ntern maker himself, called him \u2018\u2018the prince of stove\ndesigners . . . to whom we owe the greater part of our\nmodern conveniences in the cooking stove, either\nas absolute inventor or else the man who worked\nout the idea and made it practical.\u2019\u201935 According to\nFreedley, he held \u2018\u2018the same relation to the stove\nmanufacturers of the United States, that the mo-\ndistes of Paris bear to the tailors and dress-makers.\u2019\u2019\nHis skills as stove inventor, designer, and pattern\nmaker brought consumers \u2018\u2018those beautiful shapes\nwhich both warm and grace our parlors, while in the\nkitchen he has been our patron and friend in econ-\nomising our fuel.\u2019\u201936\nVedder was already \u2018\u2018extensively engaged in the\nmanufacture of patterns for the principal cities\nof the United States\u2019\u2019 by the mid 1840s, when he\nbought Hanley\u2019s pioneering stove pattern shop.\nOver the next decade he turned it into \u2018\u2018the largest\nbusiness of the kind in the United States,\u2019\u2019 with\nabout thirty employees and \u2018\u2018an unrivalled reputa-\ntion not only among the Stove manufacturers of\nTroy, but among the leading stove and iron houses\nthroughout the country.\u2019\u201937 Between 1851, when\nhe took out his first patent in partnership with Ezra\nRipley, and his death in 1879, he was first named\npatentee on 221 designs and the second name on a\nfurther sixteen; key members of his team added\nanother ten in their own right, so that his workshop\nproduced one-sixth of all the patented stove de-\nsigns in this period. Over time, his influence and\nhis output both grew: in his last decade, account-\ning for more than half of his recorded work, he\nwas responsible for 30 percent of patented stove\ndesigns.\nVedder devised many of the techniques and\ntools of the specialized trade of stove patternmak-\ning that he helped create, as well as its most success-\nful business model.38 While Ripley almost always\nworked to commission, Vedder also began to take\nthe risk of originating designs, then finding buyers\nfor them. By the 1870s he was introducing a suite\nof new models every year, releasing them all onto\nthe market at the same time, and publishing a\ncatalog, of which, unfortunately, no copies seem to\nsurvive, though many numbered pages from it are\nreproduced in patent office records. He usually re-\ntained ownership of his patents and sold identical\nsets of iron production patterns plus the right to\nuse them to numerous customers right across the\nindustrial belt, who could simply buy what they\nneeded from his product list. Clients added their\nown names to the stoves\u2014Vedder did not name his\nown products, simply emblazoning them with one\nword, \u2018\u2018patented,\u2019\u2019 as a placeholder for the names\nhis clients chose\u2014but made few other changes,\nthereby further increasing Vedder\u2019s influence on\nproduct evolution and design convergence. And,\nwhereas Ripley\u2019s business was confined to other\nCapital District firms, Vedder reached out to ma-\njor stove makers nationwide with both a custom-\ndesign service and his off-the-shelf product line.\nFor example, when Giles Filley was starting up pro-\nduction in St. Louis, the most westerly production\ncenter, where there were no local stove designers\n33 Edwin Freedley, Leading Pursuits and Leading Men (Philadel-\nphia: Edward Young, 1856), 276.\n34 Ibid., 279. Smith and Brown also were able, of course, to\ntake advantage of design patent protection from the very outset of\ntheir business, which must have been an incentive for them to\ndedicate themselves to it.\n35 J. L. Gobeille, \u2018\u2018Engineering and Mechanical Problems in\nCook\u2019s Stove Construction,\u2019\u2019 Journal of the Association of Engineering\nSocieties 5 (1885): 204\u201313, quotation from 205; \u2018\u2018Stove Notes,\u2019\u2019\nStoves and Hardware 9, no. 10 (November 1, 1886): 17.\n36 Freedley, Leading Pursuits, 276.\n37 Ibid., 277. According to Wayne Somers, comp. and ed., Ency-\nclopaedia of Union College History (Schenectady, NY: Union College\nPress, 2003), 523, Vedder was Eliphalet Nott\u2019s assistant in his \u2018\u2018stove\nlaboratory,\u2019\u2019 which was presumably where he learned his trade in the\n1830s. \u2018\u2018The Prohibition Nominee. Sketch of the Candidate for\nGovernor and his Father,\u2019\u2019 New York Times, September 13, 1885, 6,\ngives 1835 as the date when Vedder began his business, as does the\nCitizens\u2019 Association (Troy, NY), The Industrial Advantages of Troy,\nN.Y. and Environs (Rochester, NY: James P. McKinney, 1895), 51, but\nthis seems improbably early; it may elide the histories of the Hanley\nand Vedder firms to exaggerate the latter\u2019s age. Vedder retired in\n1879, shortly before his death, selling his interest in \u2018\u2018the largest stove\npattern making establishment in the State, if not in the country\u2019\u2019 to his\nbookkeeper, Henry Clay Bascom. In 1895, by which time most of the\nstove manufacturing industry had abandoned Troy, Bascom still em-\nployed 125 skilled men, offering companies nationwide a compre-\nhensive design-and-build service.\n38 International Correspondence Schools, Patternmaking, pt. 5,\n13, on Vedder\u2019s standard curves for drawing and gauging.\n386 Winterthur Portfolio 43:4\nto call on in the early 1850s, he bypassed Cincin-\nnati, the nearest city with a small corps of pattern\nmakers, and turned instead to Troy, New York,\nwhere his older brother Marcus was an attorney\nand served as his buying agent. Vedder supplied\nthe quality designs Filley needed in order to achieve\nhis ambition of persuading western customers that\nhis Excelsior Stove Works\u2019 home-produced goods\ncould rival eastern imports.39 The stove Vedder de-\nsigned, the \u2018\u2018Charter Oak,\u2019\u2019 became the nation\u2019s\nlargest seller and the foundation of Excelsior\u2019s for-\ntunes; by the early 1870s it was the country\u2019s biggest\nproducer (fig. 17). Clients like Giles Filley and later\nDetroit Stove, which achieved a similarly impressive\ngrowth record, were all the advertisement Vedder\u2019s\nfirm needed.\nThe Patternmaking Process\nHow did Nicholas Vedder\u2019s firm and its lesser rivals\nfunction? Stove designs were first of all sketched\nout on paper, using the craft\u2019s own peculiar draft-\ning customs, then translated into full-size wooden\nmodels, and finally into patterns for the individual\ncomponent plates. With the most elaborately dec-\norated products, particularly high-value heating\nstoves, there came to be an intermediate stage be-\ntween the design sketch and the wooden model,\nwith stoves being sculpted as full-size clay or plaster\nmodels first. This technique, designing from the out-\nside in, emphasized the increasing attention given to\nsurface form, which changed from season to season,\nrather than to the internal arrangement of working\nparts, which evolved much more slowly (fig. 18). In\nthis case, detailed working drawings and wood\npatternmaking could begin only after the external\nshape had been decided. From the wooden master\npatterns prototype plates would be molded, as-\nsembled, and tested. Any necessary changes would\nbe incorporated into reworked wooden versions\nuntil finally the iron production patterns could be\ncast. The wooden masters were then cleaned, lac-\nquered, polished, and put away in a (supposedly)\nfireproof store until required again, to produce a\nnew set of production patterns, or\u2014when a stove\nwas no longer in production\u2014for the casting of oc-\ncasional replacement parts on demand, a lucrative\nbusiness in its own right.40\nThis was a complicated, highly skilled, and costly\nprocess, uniting artistry, draftsmanship, precision\nwoodworking and metalworking, and considerable\nengineering knowledge, for example, of combus-\ntion and heat-transfer processes or of how a small\nredesign would make a plate cheaper to mold, eas-\nier to assemble, and less likely to crack. It also de-\nmanded a detailed understanding of what both the\nmarket required and patent law permitted, that is,\nhow closely one could imitate a successful rival with-\nout risking an infringement suit. Jafew Van Buren,\nsuperintendent of the pattern department at\nRathbone, Sard and Co., Albany\u2019s largest firm, later\nexplained this part of his role: \u2018\u2018The designer is sup-\nposed to have a knowledge of the striking features\nof all competing goods.\u2019\u201941\nVedder\u2019s and other major pattern shops could\ndo every aspect of the work for their customers,\ndeploying a range and quality of experience and\nskills that none but the largest stove makers could\nhope to replicate in-house. Stove makers did need\nto have their own small patternmaking teams, par-\nticularly for repairs and minor modifications, but\nfor new designs and major alterations it made sense\nto go out to specialist firms. This handful of busi-\nnesses thereby became major forces for product\ndevelopment and standardization.42\nStove Makers and Their Design Choices\nThe few surviving collections of stove manufac-\nturers\u2019 records provide little detail about how they\ndealt with stove designers, whether outside con-\ntractors like Vedder or, in the case of the larger\nfirms, their own design departments.

(Hagley Museum and Library.)\nDesigning the First Mass-Market Consumer Durable 389\nmid-1850s by Giles Filley\u2019s older brother Marcus,\nwho abandoned the practice of law in 1854 and\nfollowed Giles into the stove trade, provide the best\nprimary evidence of the everyday workings of the\nrelationship between a stove maker and his jobbing\npattern maker. Filley sent Vedder a constant flow\nof orders for new patterns and major changes to\nexisting ones and received itemized bills for parts\nand labor in return, so that he could allocate pat-\ntern costs to particular stove models and fix their\nprices accordingly. Labor costs were denominated\nin quarter-days and varied in price depending on\nwhose days\u2019 labor they were. Vedder\u2019s own natu-\nrally commanded the highest cost, as the proprie-\ntor, who described himself in the 1865 state census\nsimply as \u2018\u2018head carver,\u2019\u2019 continuing to do skilled\nwork himself when required, even though he had\ntens of employees by then. He was Filley\u2019s most ex-\npensive, essential, and trusted supplier.43\nStove manufacturers\u2019 records are more infor-\nmative about how they decided what to commis-\nsion or buy from pattern makers, what to imitate\nfrom their competitors, and how their own prod-\nucts needed to be modified and presented. The\nsource of their information was in most cases what\none might call, somewhat modifying Ruth Schwartz\nCowan\u2019s original meaning, \u2018\u2018the consumption junc-\ntion,\u2019\u2019 the nexus where makers, dealers, and con-\nsumers interacted with one another\u2014in other\nwords, the market.44\nStove manufacturers had the great advantage of\nbeing directly connected with their customers\u2014\nwith local stove dealers, because makers func-\ntioned as their own wholesalers, and even with\nindividual consumers, because they often operated\nas retailers too. They did not have to rely on costly\nintermediaries for market information.45 It poured\nin unprompted. The files of the Green Island Stove\nWorks are full of suggestions and requests for minor\nmodifications. Some were intended to improve du-\nrability and serviceability, others to meet the specific\nneeds of niche markets; for example, the No. 9 New\nYork and Erie stove would not sell in Vermont\nwithout a special thirteen-inch boiler hole or \u2018\u2018dairy\ntop\u2019\u2019 to suit cheese makers (fig. 19).46\nMarcus Filley\u2019s correspondents went beyond\nmaking small suggestions to offer detailed strategic\nadvice on how to meet the competition. For ex-\nample, in 1867 D. L. Fullerton, a major customer\njobbing stoves in the new markets of the Recon-\nstruction South (\u2018\u2018even the Negroes are buying\nthem\u2019\u2019), commented on how Filley\u2019s leading cook-\nstove models should be made to look: \u2018\u2018In appear-\nance [the Civilian] ought to compete with the Henry\nClay [another Troy stove;] it will also have to com-\npete this winter with the \u2018Peerless\u2019 (Boston), \u2018Cotton\nPlanter,\u2019 \u2018Marion\u2019 (Albany). . . . I am fearful compe-\ntitors will get ahead of me on Premium stoves. I think\nthe Texana would be more imposing if set up on feet\n9 inches high.\u2019\u2019 Sometimes these reports responded\nto requests for information: \u2018\u2018There is no anti-dust\nstove in the market that I know of unless the Olive\nBranch has that convenience. . . . You ask how that\nstove is taking here.\u2019\u2019 But Filley could usually rely on\nhis customers to take the initiative, particularly in\nproviding critical feedback on his products. \u2018\u2018I have\nbeen thinking of the credit of the Chief Cook. I fear\nits good name will suffer before long for want of a\nmore substantial fire back. . . . I believe a different or\nlighter front grate and heavier fire back for wood\nstove would be more satisfactory. Do not think me\narrogant, I simply give benefit of my experience in\nselling your stoves.\u2019\u201947\nSimilar information flowed in from Filley\u2019s part-\nner, who ran their New York sales agency. He\nreported, for example, that the Cottage Cook needed\na new top to meet the requirements of two distinct\ngroups of city buyers\u2014\u2018\u2018oyster and liquor dealers\nfor the little restaurant cooking they require\u2019\u2019 and\n43 Vedder to Filley, February 4, 1863, folder 21, box 1; Vedder\nto Filley, January 1, 1864, folder 1, box 2; Vedder to Filley, January 1,\n1867, folder 3, box 5\u2014all in Filley Papers, NYSL; Vedder to Filley,\nFebruary 2, 1869, folder 20, box 1, Filley Papers, RPI; Vedder to\nFilley, 1872, \u2018\u2018Targets\u2019\u2019 folder, box 1, Filley Papers, NYSL; census in-\nformation from http:\/\/www.connorsgenealogy.com\/Troy1865\/\n3rdWard-R.htm.

The stove trade\u2019s manufacturing\ntechniques were sufficiently flexible to accommodate\npartial customization of small batches of otherwise-\nstandard goods.\nMore potentially costly advice also came from\nthe company\u2019s traveling salesmen, dealing with re-\ntailers and meeting the competition in the firm\u2019s\nextensive and varied sales territories from New\nEngland to the Midwest and down through Texas.\nFor example, in 1881 one reported at length on\nwhat was needed to win and then hold a major cus-\ntomer and enable him to build his market: he was\nselling the \u2018\u2018Iron King,\u2019\u2019 made by Charles Noble\nand Co. of Philadelphia and designed by Filley\u2019s\nown pattern maker Nicholas Vedder (D11175,\n1879), but might be persuaded to buy Filley\u2019s\n\u2018\u2018Texas Girl\u2019\u2019 if the price, quality, and crucially the\ndesign were right. Visual appeal was all-important:\na customer would come into the store and see \u2018\u2018an\nattractive looking stove\u2019\u2019 with a \u2018\u2018nickel knob and\nPanel Plate of a man\u2019s head with helmet on it\u2019\u2019 that\n\u2018\u2018catches his eye.

Almost all of them chose instead\nto become practiced imitators rather than significant\ninnovators.\nThe planning and implementation of imitation\nand incremental change were thus the key strategic\ndecisions companies had to make, and they resulted\nin significant investment. At Marcus Filley\u2019s stove\nworks, everything depended on the boss; in larger\nfirms, things were somewhat more formalized, for\nexample, the Detroit Stove Works in the 1860s and\n1870s with its detailed, minuted board of directors\u2019\ndiscussions and decisions. At the Reading (Pennsyl-\nvania) Stove Works in the 1890s, the scale of invest-\nment was similar to the Detroit firm\u2019s, though the\nmanner of controlling it was a little different. Here\npattern purchase or modification decisions were\ndevolved to the board\u2019s most active and important\nworking group, the Pattern Committee, which was\ninformed, in particular, by an annual gathering of\nthe company\u2019s traveling salesmen and the managers\nof its branch houses in its major regional markets.\nCommittee recommendations were then discussed,\noften in some detail, by the full board, in light of its\npolicy \u2018\u2018to carefully consider the large number of\nsuggestions and requests for new goods made by\nsalesmen and others, and . . . to select for the addi-\ntions to the line, such stoves and ranges as yield the\nlargest profit, even though they are not always such\nas will have the largest sale.\u2019\u201951 Market sensitivity like\nthis still locked the mature industry of the 1890s\ninto the habits of model proliferation and constant\nsuperficial innovation which had characterized it\nfor almost half a century.\nFrom the Design Patent System to the Annual\nModel Change\nGiven all that has been demonstrated so far about\nthe importance of design patents to the stove in-\ndustry from the early 1840s through a fifteen-year\nperiod of rapid growth and maturation, how is the\ndeclining tendency to use them that set in by the\nend of the 1850s to be explained? The absolute\nnumber of design patents issued fell, and their share\nof the total volume of stove patenting fell even\nmore, from a high of 82 percent in 1852 to a low of\n11 percent by 1864, before stabilizing in the range\nof 10\u201315 percent until the end of the century.52\nPart of the explanation is simply the reverse of\nthe major reason why stove makers seized on design\npatents in the first place. Restrictive administration\nand tight funding of the U.S. Patent Office had\nmade patents for invention relatively hard to secure,\nbut in the early 1850s these policies began to be re-\nlaxed, making such patents much more accessible\nand attractive. Concurrent changes in the federal\ncourts\u2019 practice (particularly the development of the\ninjunction route to enforcement, in place of jury\ntrials) also made them more valuable.53 The volume\nof successful invention patenting responded swiftly\nto these institutional changes, more than doubling\nbetween 1853 and 1854, doubling again by 1858,\nand\u2014after a modest decline during the Civil War\u2014\nagain by 1866. It leveled off after 1867 at around\n12,000\u201314,000 patents per year until the end of\nthe 1870s versus around 500\u2013900 in the restrictive\nperiod from the start of the 1840s to the early 1850s.\nThe stove industry participated in this growth\nprocess, with numbers of stove inventions rising\nfrom a low of nineteen in 1852 to a new high of 123\nby 1859, falling off sharply at the start of the Civil\nWar, and then surging from 1864 onward to an all-\ntime peak of 429 in 1869.

In 1860 Henry Howson, an experienced\nPhiladelphia patent attorney with stove makers\nprominent among his clients, wrote in the Franklin\nInstitute\u2019s Journal a detailed explanation for this dis-\nappointment. The 1842 law offered \u2018\u2018a very doubt-\nful protection against infringers.\u2019\u2019 A stove maker\n\u2018\u2018getting up a new design for a stove . . . must . . . be\npossessed of a well cultivated taste, a readiness\nfor producing figures and ornaments of pleasing\neffect,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018the requisite capital to meet the ex-\npenses.\u2019\u2019 He estimated these costs at $1,000\u2013$3,000\nfor each of the three or four sizes needed, a high\nfigure even if it included special production equip-\nment as well as wood and iron patternmaking and\nprototyping. And yet the law only imperfectly pro-\ntected this large investment, and then only for a\nseven-year term. Howson\u2019s argument was that if the\nfee was doubled, to make it the same as for inven-\ntion patents, and the term was doubled, too, the law\nwould at last deliver on its promise, and the volume\nof applications would increase, \u2018\u2018the benefit being\nespecially felt by the manufacturers of stoves.\u2019\u2019\nHowson was on the side of the larger firms, who\nbore the brunt of the business of innovation, rather\nthan \u2018\u2018small manufacturers, men with neither taste,\nenterprise, nor capital,\u2019\u2019 who were \u2018\u2018in the habit of\nwaiting for the expiration of a patent of a popular\nand elaborately carved stove, and after this expira-\ntion, of purchasing a stove, using the plates for\npatterns, and furnishing them to the public to the\ninjury of the original producers.\u2019\u2019 If they were forced\nto wait fourteen rather than seven years, the original\ndesigners could recover all their investment first.56\nCongress appears to have listened to arguments\nlike these, for in 1861 the law was indeed changed,\npartly perhaps as a response to the collapse of new\npatenting activity at the outbreak of war. The new\nlaw gave design patentees the option of a 3 1\/2 -, 7-,\nor 14-year term, with the longer period attracting\nthe same fee as for invention patents. There was\nalso a simplification of the eligibility criteria to\n\u2018\u2018any new form of an article, or any impression or figure\nupon the surface of any article or material, by what-\never means or process produced.\u2019\u201957 But the 1861\nlaw evidently did not have the effect Howson had\npredicted, perhaps because the simultaneous liber-\nalization of patents for invention made it increas-\ningly possible to include design features alongside\nfunctional innovations in regular patent applica-\ntions. As we have seen, the number of design pat-\nents did not recover, nor did their share of total\nstove patenting, and a sample examination of all of\nthe 1873 stove design patents reveals that, wherever\nthe term of a patent is recorded, it is generally the\nold standard of 7 years; where there is variation, it is\nalmost always downward, to 3 1\/2 years.\nThis cannot have been because of the differ-\nence in patent fees, which was a negligible propor-\ntion of the cost (and value) of any design thought\nto be worth patenting. The most plausible explana-\ntion is one that points toward the post\u2013Civil War\nyears as marking a new stage in the stove industry\u2019s\nevolution. Competition on the basis of design (in-\ncluding, now, both minor functional differences\nand variations in form, decoration, and ornament)\nbecame even more intense as the market matured,\nand overcapacity emerged at the end of the 1860s,\na decade in which stove sales doubled. But this was\nthe last period of similar growth and prosperity\nthat the industry would ever know.\nIn this new environment, few designs could be\nexpected to remain marketable for seven years, let\nalone fourteen. Three and one-half years was now\nthe maximum period during which the cost of many\nnew designs would have to be recovered, a reality to\nwhich Nicholas Vedder, for example, adapted by\nmaking it the normal duration of his proprietary\npatents.

The first\neffect of this competition has been to set manufacturers to\nwork planning how to improve and beautify their goods,\nand next season we may expect to see a still larger display\nof novelties.60\nWhat was meant by \u2018\u2018novelties\u2019\u2019? This was one of\nthose terms of the trade that everybody used but,\ninconveniently for the historian, nobody bothered\nto define. It seems to have meant new designs for\nstoves that were not of a very high quality and did\nnot include significant functional improvements\nbut, instead, were intended simply to look good\u2014\nto impress buyers and to be loaded with patented\nfeatures as \u2018\u2018talking points\u2019\u2019 for salesmen to use\n(fig. 22). \u2018\u2018Novelties\u2019\u2019 were meant to gleam in the58 Editorial, \u2018\u2018The National Association of Stove Manufactu-\nrers,\u2019\u2019 MW 3, no. 25 ( June 19, 1875): 4.\n59 Editorial, \u2018\u2018The Stove Manufacturers,\u2019\u2019 MW 5, no. 4 ( Janu-\nary 22, 1876): 6.\nFig. 22.

It also had unforeseen con-\nsequences; for example, dealers became reluctant\nto place annual bulk orders or to take the risk of\nholding stock that might become unsalable. The\ndevelopment of the railroad system also meant that\nthey no longer had to buy in boatload or carload\nlots\u2014hand-to-mouth buying had become feasible\nas well as necessary.

Paradoxically,\none of the reasons why the volume of patenting\nactivity fell after 1869, even as the industry became\never more addicted to change, may have been that\nthe near certainty of having a good idea quickly\ncopied or stolen reduced the incentive to patent\nit. Rather, \u2018\u2018precedence in the field will give the\nmanufacturer all the advantages he could reasonably\nexpect to derive from a patent, if he had it. By the\ntime others are ready to follow him he will be ready to\ntry something else.\u2019\u201966\nStove makers might not all like this new envi-\nronment, but they recognized that their only choice\nwas to adapt to it. Frank Magee, superintendent of\nthe great factory his father John had founded in\nChelsea, Massachusetts, complained about the re-\nsults in 1887: \u2018\u2018We expend in the neighborhood of\n$20,000 a year simply for the production of new de-\nsigns and patterns. We must constantly be placing\nnew designs on the market. A stove that made a\nsuccess last year and sold far ahead of any other on\nthe market is just as likely as not to be relegated to\noblivion this season. The public are insatiable in\ntheir demands for something new, and of course we\nmust study to satisfy the wants of the public.\u2019\u201967 The\nrecords of the Reading Stove Works, an industry\nleader (it supplied all Sears, Roebuck and Co.\u2019s\nhuge stove trade), demonstrate that, in the follow-\ning decade, there was no letup. Whether business\nwas good or bad, the constant stream of stylistic inno-\nvations had to be maintained to stimulate demand\nand respond to competition. The resulting rapidly\ndepreciating fixed capital investment in an enor-\nmously wide model range was very considerable\u2014\namounting in 1891, for example, to $42,000 in pat-\nterns as against $97,000 in real estate, machinery,\nand fixtures, to support sales of about $480,000.\nSpending on this scale had to be justified to stock-\nholders in successive presidents\u2019 annual reports. In\n1893, for example, the report claimed that \u2018\u2018it is\nnecessary in the stove business to spend each year\nfor new patterns an amount of money that would\nseem extravagant to most business men. This ex-\npenditure is required however, in order to meet\ncompetition and to keep abreast with improve-\nments and new ideas of the times.\u2019\u2019 Even in a de-\npressed year like 1893 the company felt forced to\nwrite off $16,966 (60 percent) of its pattern assets\nand spend $22,632 on replacements and additions\u2014\nequivalent to about 40 percent of profits, but, as the\npresident again argued, this was \u2018\u2018strictly an outlay as\nnecessary to the progress and success of the company\nas is the expenditure made for pig iron or fuel. New\ngoods must . . . be placed upon the market to meet\nthe competition of other progressive and energetic\nhouses.\u2019\u2019 There was \u2018\u2018no department of the business\nmore important. . . . The exercise of skill, taste and\ningenuity in getting up new patterns is highly nec-\nessary in order that the patterns may be fully up to the\nhigh standard set by numerous able and wide awake\ncompetitors whom we must meet in the markets we\noccupy.\u2019\u2019 Despite the \u2018\u2018promises from year to year that\nthe Pattern Expense would be reduced,\u2019\u2019 there was\nno way of doing this: \u2018\u2018the demands of competition\ncontinue to call for constant changing and the pro-\nduction of new lines.\u2019\u201968\nThe Long Recessional: An Industry in Decline\nBy the end of the century, the industry seemed\nlocked into a practice of frequent and unceasing\ndesign innovation that no longer brought the ben-\nefits it may have done a generation earlier but from\nwhich there was no escape. It was producing a mature\nproduct for a stagnant market and facing increasing\ncompetition from new technologies (hot-water and\nsteam heating) and new fuels (kerosene and both\nmanufactured and natural gas). Even within the\nfield of solid-fuel stoves and furnaces there was\ntough competition from manufacturers exploit-\ning new materials that were increasingly cheap\nand easy to work, particularly heavy-gauge sheet\nsteel, shaped on power presses and riveted up.\nStove makers\u2019 reaction to their loss of market\nshare was usually just to carry on doing things the\nonly way they knew or to withdraw from the busi-\nness altogether. Standard operating procedures\nlearned in the middle decades of the nineteenth\ncentury served the stove trade increasingly poorly\nby its end, and yet the structure, culture, and habits\nof the industry limited its freedom to produce an\ninnovative response. For example, the habit of out-\nsourcing stove design to independent pattern mak-\ners, or the conservatism and autonomy of an in-house\npattern department, meant that new stove models\ncontinued to be designed from the outside in, en-\ntailing a complete replacement of patterns even for\nthe unchanging internal working parts (fig. 26).

The discussion illustrates the industry\u2019s chronic problems,\nmanufacturers\u2019 awareness of possible solutions, and yet the extreme\ndifficulty of actually doing anything constructive about them.\nFig. 27. \u2018\u2018The Clermont Range.\u2019\u2019 From Gem City Stove Co., Clermont Stoves and Ranges: Illustrated\nPrice List, No. 18 (Dayton, OH: Gem City Stove Co., 1902), 34. (Hagley Museum and Library.)\n402 Winterthur Portfolio 43:4\nAt the turn of the century, the cast-iron stove\nwas still a ubiquitous and essential domestic ap-\npliance. But for all of manufacturers\u2019 efforts to re-\nnew it by continuous superficial redesign and to\nbolt on ever more added extras such as oven ther-\nmometers, the new must-have, it was no longer any-\nthing but an old technology expensively clad in an\nincreasingly out-of-date fashion. The writing was\non the wall, and for the domestic appliance indus-\ntry it read cleanliness\u2014smooth surfaces\u2014a func-\ntional, labor-saving aesthetic. The stove industry\u2019s\ndays were numbered. But its movement toward the\nmargins of the American consumer economy would\nnot happen quickly. And even though manufac-\nturers\u2019 expectations for its future became increas-\ningly pessimistic, many did their best to respond to\nthe challenges of the early twentieth century with\none last great burst of remodeling. They abandoned\nthe swirling, bulging, heavily carved excesses of the\nsecond rococo revival, the dominant style of the late\n1890s and early 1900s, which had demanded the\nutmost skill from pattern makers and molders alike\n(fig. 27). Instead, they embraced what they thought\nof as modernity, simplifying stove shapes, eliminat-\ning decoration, minimizing nickel work, and even-\ntually covering every surface, all of them now flat or\njust slightly rounded, with a light-colored enamel\nfinish (figs. 28\u201329). Ironically, the pursuit of plain-\nness to enable stoves to fit more easily into the post-\nVictorian household was the industry\u2019s last great\nstylistic innovation, beginning in 1902 and deter-\nmining stoves\u2019 appearance through the following\ndecades. In 1931 Leslie Dana, only son of Giles\nFilley\u2019s successor at Excelsior and president of what\nwas by then the Charter Oak Stove and Range Co.,\nrenamed after its most famous product, patented\nhis last stove, No. 1,836,578. His aim was to \u2018\u2018pro-\nvide a stove of sanitary construction and pleasing\n[\u2018stream-lined\u2019] appearance, especially designed\nto be finished in enamel, and easily kept clean.\u2019\u2019 It\nwould provide \u2018\u2018maximum fire box capacity with\nminimum floorspace.\u2019\u2019 Stoves had been born as es-\nsentially utilitarian objects in the Age of Jackson;\nthey died the same way in the Age of Roosevelt\n(fig. 30).\nConclusion\nDoes the story of this distinctively American indus-\ntry of the long nineteenth century, once so impor-\ntant, now almost forgotten except by a loyal corps\nof collectors and enthusiasts, possess more than\nantiquarian interest?70 Perhaps.\nThe stove trade was a somewhat introverted\nbusiness community, made up of men who spent\nmost of their careers within one or two companies,\nusually within the same locality. Their points of ref-\nerence in their extensive discussions about busi-\nness practices rarely included any other industries,\nas if they either did not know much about other\nenterprises whose problems were actually quite com-\nparable to theirs or even believed that the stove trade\nwas sui generis, so that other people\u2019s experience was\neither irrelevant or inapplicable.71\nFig. 28. \u2018\u2018Canopy Dawn Range.\u2019\u2019 From Buckwalter Stove\nCo., Catalogue No. 36 (Royersford, PA: Buckwalter Stove\nCo., 1902), 45.

(Printed Book and Periodical Collection, Winterthur Library.)\n404 Winterthur Portfolio 43:4\nNevertheless, stove men used two semihumo-\nrous analogies when talking about the kind of busi-\nness they were in, which can help us to understand\nand contextualize it, too. On the one hand, a stove\nwas like a coffin: it was for use, not enjoyment;\npeople only bought them when they needed them,\nand only one at a time. But the stove trade was also\nlike the millinery business. As Sherman Jewett ad-\nvised his colleagues in 1875, \u2018\u2018A stove superceded\nand out of style falls . . . flat. The stove manufac-\nturer must, in some way, familiarize himself with\nthe people who are to be his customers; must an-\nticipate their wants, and, if possible, determine the\nfashions.\u2019\u201972 Attractive design determined whose\nstoves did best in the market and how profitable a\nprice they could command. And perhaps an em-\nphasis on style and changing appearance could per-\nsuade buyers to trade in their stoves more quickly\nthan technical obsolescence required.\nThe stove trade, manufacturing and selling the\nfirst universal consumer durable, thus combined\nwithin itself, or prefigured, aspects of the experi-\nence of many other industries. The emphasis on\nrampant product proliferation, attention to appear-\nance as well as (sometimes, indeed, at the expense\nof) function, conformity to prevalent tastes for elab-\norate styles, and acute sensitivity to what the market\nrequired, together with an attempt to shape con-\nsumer taste (notably through advertising) are similar\nto many other nineteenth-century manufacturers\nof much smaller, lighter, cheaper, and less durable\nconsumer products for the American household\u2014\nnotably crockery, glassware, flatware, many kinds of\ntextiles, and some types of furniture.73 The stove\nindustry therefore was not unique. It finds its place\namong a constellation of nineteenth-century indus-\ntries one can sum up as design-intensive, styling-\ndependent, and market-responsive\u2014foundations, in\nfact, of an economy of mass consumption, though\nnot necessarily of mass production.\nOn the other hand, the coffin analogy calls to\nmind the second word in the term \u2018\u2018consumer du-\nrable.\u2019\u2019 Stoves were far more costly than most in-\ndividual items from the enormously wide output\nof the other household-products industries listed\nabove. They were bought principally to perform\nvital functions (cooking, heating, warming water),\nrather than to look good. They needed mainte-\nnance and after-sales service from dealers. And they\nwere not replaced very often. An element of discre-\ntion entered into the timing of purchases\u2014in hard\ntimes, a stove\u2019s life easily could be extended\u2014and\nthey were rarely impulse buys. In all these respects,\nFig. 30. Patent drawing for Leslie Dana, \u2018\u2018Domestic\nRange,\u2019\u2019 patent D75014, St. Louis, 1928.

Entre-\npreneurs had to devise and implement appropri-\nate strategies at each stage, notably in the areas of\nproduct design and differentiation and the adoption\nof an emphasis on continuous superficial innovation\nand stylistic change for the pursuit of competitive ad-\nvantage in a market that entered its maturity shortly\nafter the Civil War. As they faced the challenges of a\ndeclining market in the early 1900s, some stove mak-\ners in Detroit, by then long established as the indus-\ntry\u2019s largest production center, began to move their\ncapital and some manufacturing capacity (notably\nfor patternmaking and high-quality foundry work)\ninto a new metal consumer-durable business not too\nfar removed from what they knew best.74 Automobile\nand parts manufacture seemed to offer huge pros-\npects of profits and growth but would in due course\nattain maturity itself and have to devise its own stra-\ntegic responses, some of which would probably have\nstruck any stove manufacturer from the 1860s on-\nward as quite familiar.\n74 Donald F. Davis, Conspicuous Production: Automobiles and Elites\nin Detroit, 1899\u20131939 (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1988),\ngives some attention to this process.\n406 Winterthur Portfolio 43:4\n"}
