Introduction, Chemistry and Antioxidant Properties of Vitamin E \nVitamin E was discovered at the University of California at Berkeley in 1922 in the laboratory of \nHerbert M. Evans (Figure 1). Eight vitamin E isoforms with biological activity have been isolated \nfrom plant and animal sources. Tocopherols are part of an interlinking set of antioxidant cycles, which \nhas been termed the so-called antioxidant network [9]. Since its discovery, mainly antioxidant and \nrecently also cell signalling aspects of tocopherols have been studied. Advances in gene chip and \nmiRNA technology have led to the discovery of novel vitamin E-sensitive genes and vitamin E \nregulated signal transduction pathways. Polymorphisms in genes involved in tocopherol tissue uptake, \nexport, and metabolism may be important determinants for the biological activity of vitamin E.  \nFigure 1.

All are derivatives of 6-chromanol with an aliphatic side-chain. The four \ntocopherol homologues (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, \u03b4-) have a fully saturated 16-carbon isoprenoid side-chain, whereas \ntocotrienols have a similar isoprenoid chain containing three double bonds. Individual tocopherols are \nnamed according to the position and number of the methyl groups on the phenol ring, with the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \n\u03b3- and \u03b4- vitamins containing three, two, two and one methyl groups respectively (Figure 2). These \nstructural differences determine the biological activity, with \u03b1-homologues being the most biologically \nactive [10].  \nThe antioxidant property of vitamin E is exerted through the phenolic hydroxyl group, which \nreadily donates its hydrogen to the peroxyl radical, resulting in the formation of a stable lipid species. \nIn donating the hydrogen atom, vitamin E becomes a relatively unreactive free radical as the unpaired \nelectron becomes delocalised into the aromatic ring. The efficiency of this protection depends upon \ntwo factors: firstly the mobility of the molecule in membranes, which is determined by the aliphatic \ntail; secondly the number of methyl species on the chromanol ring, with each methyl group conferring \nadditional antioxidant capacity. In addition, the proximity of the methyl species to the hydroxyl group \nis an important factor. Therefore \u03b1-homologues, which have the greatest number of methyl species, \nand in which these flank the hydroxyl group, are thought to be more effective than the other \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1748\nhomologues. Nevertheless, in several in vitro studies a reverse order of antioxidant efficacy with \u03b1-\ntocopherol being the least potent compound as compared to \u03b4- and \u03b3-tocopherol has been observed \n[11\u201315]. Furthermore, in superiority to \u03b1-tocopherol, \u03b3-tocopherol and other non-\u03b1-tocopherols are \nable to trap membrane-soluble electrophilic nitrogen oxides and other electrophilic mutagens \npossessing free aromatic ring positions and thereby more efficiently inhibiting reactive nitrogen \nspecies derived damage [16,17]. \nFigure 2.

The antioxidant activity of vitamin E has been \ndetailed many times (e.g., [18]). In this regard vitamin E is able to scavenge peroxyl radicals \nessentially neutralizing them to form hydroperoxides. Lipid peroxyl radicals are formed during lipid \nperoxidation. Following an initiating event induced by, for example, a reactive oxygen species, a \nhydrogen molecule is abstracted from a C-H bond that has been weakened due to the proximity to an \nelectron withdrawing double bond found in polyunsaturated fatty acids forming a carbon-centered \nradical. During this process there is molecular rearrangement of the lipid to a conjugated diene \nstructure and addition of O2 to the carbon-centered radical giving rise to a lipid peroxyl radical. This \nradical is highly reactive and if not quenched will react with a nearby polyunsaturated fatty acid \ncausing another initiating event and hence propagating lipid peroxidation. As a scavenger of peroxyl \nradicals vitamin E is acting to inhibit this chain reaction which is why it is termed a chain-breaking \nlipid antioxidant. Without vitamin E activity a single initiating event could potentially lead to the \nproduction of thousands of lipid peroxides which would have a deleterious effect on the biological \nmembrane and its function. The sequence of events can be seen as: \n(1) -LH + ROS \u00c6 L \n(2) -L. + O2 \u00c6 -LOO. \n(3) -LOO. + VEH \u00c6 LOOH + VE. \nIt is hypothesized that vitamin E acts catalytically, being efficiently reduced from its free radical \n(chromanoxyl) form that arises after quenching lipid radicals to return back to its reduced native state. \nThis catalysis occurs through the interactions between water- and lipid-soluble substances by both \nnonenzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms that regenerate vitamin E from its tocotrienoxyl or \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1749\ntocopheroxyl radical back to tocotrienol and tocopherol respectively. Vitamin C can regenerate \nvitamin E directly, and thiol antioxidants, such as glutathione and lipoic acid, can regenerate vitamin E \nindirectly via vitamin C. Under conditions where these systems act synergistically to keep the steady-\nstate concentration of vitamin E radicals low, the loss or consumption of vitamin E is prevented [9]. \nPrevious studies in cultured cells indicate synergistic effects between polyphenols and vitamin E  \n(\u03b3-tocopherol but not \u03b1-tocopherol) in vitro [19]. However, dietary supplementation of growing pigs \nwith green tea polyphenols did not affect serum, liver, lung and muscle vitamin E (\u03b1- and \u03b3-\ntocopherol) concentrations, plasma antioxidant capacity [20]. Furthermore, also in rats [21] and \nhumans [22] no vitamin E (\u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherol) sparing effect of dietary flavonoids was evident. \nFigure 3.

Gene Regulatory Activity of Vitamin E \nSince its discovery, mainly antioxidant and recently also cell signalling aspects of tocopherols have \nbeen studied. Vitamin E is a cell signalling molecule [23]. It interacts with cell receptors (e.g., LDL-\nreceptor) and transcription factors (e.g., pregnane X receptor) thereby driving (redox-regulated) gene \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1750\nexpression (e.g., scavenger receptor CD36). It modulates protein levels (e.g., glutathione) and changes \nenzyme activity levels (e.g., protein kinase C) both in cultured cells as well as in vivo (Figure 4).  \n \nFigure 4. Vitamin E is a cell signalling molecule and affects cell receptors, transcription \nfactors, gene expression, protein levels and enzyme activities of vitamin E specific \nmolecular targets. \n \nVitamin E\nCell receptors\nTranscription\nfactorsEnzyme activity\nGene expressionProtein level\n \n \nAzzi's group [5,24,25] first described non-antioxidant cell signalling functions for \u03b1-tocopherol, \ndemonstrating that vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) and 5-lipoxygenase and activates protein \nphosphatase 2A and diacylglycerol kinase. Some genes including \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein  \n(\u03b1-TTP), \u03b1-tropomyosin, and collagenase are affected by \u03b1-tocopherol at the transcriptional level. \nTo obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of vitamin E, \nglobal gene expression profile experiments using DNA arrays in rat liver and hepatocellular liver \ncarcinoma cells (HepG2) have been conducted.  \nFor the analysis of short-term (49 days) [26] and long-term (290 days) vitamin E deficiency [27], \nrats were fed semisynthetic diets either supplemented with or deficient in vitamin E (DL-\u03b1-tocopheryl \nacetate [26]; RRR-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate [27]). In addition, HepG2 cells were treated with vitamin E \n(RRR-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate) concentrations comparable to those that were achieved in the in vivo \nexperiment [28]. Differential gene expression in rat liver and that in HepG2 cells were measured by \nDNA arrays comprising up to 7,000 genes. Dietary vitamin E deficiency over a 7-week period did not \ninduce any significant changes in the expression profile among the genes evaluated. However, long-\nterm vitamin E deficiency upregulated coagulation factor IX (FIX), 5-\u03b1-steroid reductase type 1, and \nCD36 mRNA levels. Furthermore, vitamin E deficiency resulted in a significant downregulation of \nhepatic \u03b3-glutamyl-cysteinyl synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis. \nMeasurement of the corresponding biological endpoints such as activated partial thromboplastin time, \nplasma dihydrotestosterone and hepatic glutathione substantiated the gene chip data which indicated \nthat dietary vitamin E plays an important role in a range of metabolic processes within the liver. \nAccording to the rat experiment, vitamin E supplementation changed coagulation factor IX and CD36 \nexpression in HepG2 cells; thus, in vivo data could be partly confirmed with the in vitro model. \nOverall, our studies reveal that dietary vitamin E has important long-term effects on liver gene \nexpression with potential downstream effects on extrahepatic tissues. \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1751\nWe have recently studied the short- and long-term effects of natural and synthetic vitamin E on \ncytochrome (CYP) P450 dependent gene expression using Affymetrix GeneChip technology. To this \nend, HepG2 hepatoma cells were incubated with 0, 10, 30, 80 and 300 \u03bcM RRR-tocopheryl acetate \n(natural vitamin E) or all-rac-tocopheryl acetate (synthetic vitamin E) for 7 days and the mRNA of \nCYP genes was quantified. The expression of only one (CYP20A1) of 14 CYP genes with detectable \nmRNA levels was dosedependently up-regulated. No differences in gene-regulatory activity were \nobserved between RRR- and all-rac-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate. To study the role of vitamin E in CYP gene \nexpression in vivo, Fisher 344 rats were randomly assigned to either a vitamin E-enriched (RRR-\ntocopheryl acetate) or \u2013deficient diet. Neither in the vitamin E-enriched, nor in the vitamin E-deficient \nrats, were significant changes in the liver CYP mRNA levels observed. These data indicate that \nvitamin E did not appear to modulate cytochrome P450 mRNA expression in our HepG2 cells or our \nin rat study [29]. However, other studies demonstrate that \u03b1-tocopherol supplementation did increase \nmRNA level and activity of several CYP members in the liver of mice and rats [30,31]. \nIn another set of experiment two groups of male rats were fed with either a diet deficient in \u03b1-\ntocopherol or a control diet enriched with RRR-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate. Differential gene expression in \nskeletal muscle was monitored at five time-points over 430 days, with all animals individually profiled \n[32]. Out of approximately 7,000 genes represented on the gene chip, 56 were found to be up-regulated \nin response to vitamin E in at least four consecutive time-points from as early as 91 days of deficiency. \nUp-regulated genes included muscle structure and extra cellular matrix genes, as well as anti-\noxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Our data show that molecular transcription might \nprovide a very early marker to detect oncoming degenerative conditions in vitamin E deficiency. They \nprovide further insight into possible molecular mechanisms underlying vitamin E deficiency in skeletal \nmuscle, and reveal the activation of an intensive protection program that can explain the long \nmaintenance of muscle structure during vitamin E deficiency. \nFurthermore in rat brain a significant number of genes were found to be regulated by vitamin E. \nThese vitamin E sensitive genes encode for proteins associated with hormones and hormone \nmetabolism, nerve growth, apoptosis, dopaminergic neurotransmission, and clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 \nand advanced glycated endproducts [33]. \nOur in vivo data in rats also indicate that dietary vitamin E (RRR-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate) induces \nchanges in steroidogenesis by affecting cholesterol homeostasis in testes and adrenal glands. In this \ncontext genes encoding for proteins involved in the uptake (LDL receptor) and de novo synthesis (e.g., \n7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluteryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-\nmethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, isopentenyl diphosphate \u03b4-isomerase, and farnesyl \npyrophosphate synthetase) of cholesterol (Figure 5), the precursor of all steroid hormones, have been \nidentified as vitamin E sensitive molecular targets [34]. \n \n \n \n \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1752\nFigure 5.

Comparative Quantification of Pharmacodynamic Parameters of RRR- vs. all-rac-\u03b1 \nTocopherol by Global Gene Expression Profiling \nPharmacologically active compounds (e.g., from the groups of pharmaceutical drugs, cofactors or \nvitamins) often consist of two or more stereoisomers (enantiomers or diastereoisomers) which may \ndiffer in their pharmacodynamic\/kinetic, toxicological and biological properties. A well-known \nexample is vitamin E which is predominantly administered as two different forms, one derived from \nnatural sources (mainly soybeans), and one from production by chemical total-synthesis. While \nvitamin E from natural sources occurs as a single stereoisomer (RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol), synthetic vitamin \nE (all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol) is an equimolar mixture of eight stereoisomers. Based on a number of animal \nand human studies it has been suggested that the biological potency of natural-source vitamin E  \n(RRR-) is 1.36 greater compared to its counterpart produced by chemical synthesis (all-rac) [35]. We \nhave used the Affymetrix GeneChip technology to evaluate the feasibility of a new bio-assay where \nthe gene regulatory activities of RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol and all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol were quantified and \ncompared on the genome-wide level [36]. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were supplemented with \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1753\nincreasing amounts of RRR- or all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol for seven days. Genes showing a dose-related \ninduction\/repression were identified by global gene expression profiling. Our findings show that RRR- \nand all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol share an identical transcriptional activity, i.e., induce\/repress the expression \nof the same set of genes. Based on the transcriptional dose-response data, EC50 and IC50 values were \ndetermined for each of these genes. The feasibility of calculating a \"transcriptional potency factor\" of \nRRR- vs. all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol was evaluated by dividing the EC50\/IC50 of RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol by the \ncorresponding EC50\/IC50 of all-rac-\u03b1-tocopherol for every of the vitamin E responsive genes. Using \nthis approach we have calculated 215 single biopotency ratios. Subsequently, the mean of all potency \nratios was found to be 1.05.  \nBiopotency in humans has been the subject of some debate. Several biokinetic studies comparing \nthe relative bioavailability of natural and synthetic vitamin E in humans used a competitive uptake \napproach whereby both deuterated RRR- and all-rac-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate were administered \nsimultaneously [37\u201339]. Using this competitive approach bioavailability ratios of RRR:all-rac close to \n2:1 were found. Using a non-competitive approach, whereby deuterated RRR- and all-rac-\u03b1-tocopheryl \nacetate are administered on separate occasions to the same individual, bioavailability ratios, Cmax and \nAUC analysis, (the important parameters of bioavailability in single dose studies), were 1.35:1, 1.35:1 \nand 1.33:1 respectively [40], very close to the accepted biopotency ratio of 1.36:1 derived from animal \nstudies [41,42] and in stark contrast to the findings of studies using the competitive uptake approach. It \nhas been argued that the competitive uptake model results in bias against all-rac, because when RRR \nand all-rac are given simultaneously in equal amounts, the actual dose would contain 75 % of 2R-\nforms to compete with 25 % of 2S-forms. As the 2R-forms are preferentially selected by \u03b1-TTP for \nsystemic distribution, increasing the abundance of 2R-forms lowers the probability of \u03b1-TTP binding \nto 2S-forms leading to discrimination against all-rac [43]. However when all-rac is administered \nseparately to RRR, there would be 50 % each of the 2R- to 2S-forms in all-rac and hence no such \ndiscrimination would occur. Therefore when studied using a non-competitive approach under basal \nconditions, natural (RRR) and synthetic (all-rac) \u03b1-tocopherol are kinetically equivalent and their \nrelative bioavailability conforms to the currently accepted biopotency ratio of 1.36:1 [40]. \n4. Vitamin E Regulated miRNAs \nmiRNA are a class of small, noncoding RNA, that in their mature form, are single-stranded and 22 \nnucleotides long. Mature miRNA post-transcriptionally affect gene expression by binding at the 3\u00b4 \nuntranslated region of mRNA and inhibiting their translation into proteins [44]. It has been suggested \nthat each miRNA binds on average 100 different target mRNA, allowing for post-transcriptional \nsilencing of many different genes, or potentially entire pathways, by a single miRNA [45]. miRNA are \nencoded for in the genome and are, thus, liable to regulation. In order to investigate the role of dietary \nRRR-\u03b1-tocopherol on miRNA expression, we fed rats for 6 months with diets deficient or sufficient in \nvitamin E and analyzed miRNA concentrations in the liver. For this study, we selected miRNA that \nwere previously shown to be involved in processes that have been associated with vitamin E, namely \nlipid metabolism (miRNA-122a) [46,47], cancer progression and inflammation (miRNA-125b)  \n[48\u201350]. Vitamin E deficiency resulted in decreased levels of miRNA-122a and miRNA-125b. Apart \nfrom its role in lipid metabolism, miRNA-122 was down-regulated in rodent and human hepatocellular \ncarcinomas [47]. A role for miRNA-125b in cancer development has been suggested because miRNA-\nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1754\n125b was down-regulated in human prostate cancer tissues [48,49], lung cancer cell lines [51], breast \ncancer [52], and in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue [53]. Shi and colleagues [54], on the other \nhand, found over-expression of miRNA-125b in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer samples. \nA role of miRNA-125b in inflammation is supported by a study that identified tumor necrosis \nfactor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) as a direct target of miRNA-125b. A decrease of miRNA-125b resulted in \nincreased TNF\u03b1 production and inflammation in LPS stimulated macrophages [55]. Thus, the reduced \nmiRNA-125b levels observed in our vitamin E-deficient rats may be associated with an enhanced \ninflammatory response due to vitamin E deficiency, as previously described [56,57]. Overall these data \nindicate that vitamin E regulates cell signalling not only at the mRNA level but also at the miRNA \nlevel [58]. Although gene chip and micro-RNA technology has helped to identify vitamin E sensitive \nmolecular targets, transcription factors which are specifically regulated by vitamin E have yet not been \nidentified. Furthermore a receptor that specifically binds to vitamin E is currently unknown [59]. \n5. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Genes Important in Vitamin E Homeostasis \nLarge inter-individual variation exists in the response to vitamin E supplementation, and this may \ninfluence the outcome of human studies. It is our hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity is an important \ndeterminant of vitamin E homeostasis. Therefore we have performed an in silico search for single \nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with genes involved in vitamin E homeostasis. Based on \nfunction, the following genes were considered as candidates for vitamin E heterogeneity: \u03b1-tocopherol \ntransfer protein (\u03b1-TTP), tocopherol associated protein (TAP), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), multidrug \nresistance protein 2 (MDR-2), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and members of the cytochrome P450 \nfamily (CYP). Searches for coding SNPs were initiated from web based programs of the National \nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). SNP frequencies were calculated by dividing the \nnumber of annotated coding SNPs by the number of base pairs in the open reading frame. Genes for \u03b1-\nTTP, TAP and CYP3A5 had calculated SNP frequencies between 503 and 837 base pairs per coding \nSNP (bp\/cSNP) and so are not highly polymorphic. In contrast, cSNP frequencies in LPL, MRP2, \nPXR, CYP3A4 and CYP4F2 were in the range of 100 bp\/cSNP and so are highly polymorphic. Thus \nproteins involved in specific vitamin E binding are not highly polymorphic, may not influence inter-\nindividual variation and so may not be good candidates for population studies. Proteins involved in \ndrug\/lipid metabolism which indirectly influence vitamin E status are highly polymorphic, are likely to \ninfluence inter-individual variation and so are good candidates for population studies. In this context it \nhas been shown in a biokinetic study that subjects with the apoE4 genotype differ from apoE3 subjects \nin their plasma uptake of newly absorbed \u03b1-tocopherol [60] indicating that this is an important SNP \ninfluencing vitamin E status. We suggest that future studies are aimed at addressing the role of such \nSNPs in vitamin E homeostasis [61]. \n6. ApoE\u2014Vitamin E Interactions \nIn Westernised societies the apoE4 genotype is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, \nand represents a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, late-onset Alzheimer's disease and \nother chronic disorders. ApoE is an important modulator of many stages of lipoprotein metabolism and \ntraditionally the increased risk was attributed to higher lipid levels in E4 carriers. However, more \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1755\nrecent evidence demonstrates the multifunctional nature of the apoE protein and the fact that the \nimpact of genotype on disease risk may be in large part due to an impact on oxidative status or the \nimmunomodulatory\/anti-inflammatory properties of apoE. An increasing number of studies in cell \nlines [62,63], transgenic rodents [64] and human volunteers [65,66] indicate higher oxidative stress \nand a more pro-inflammatory state associated with the epsilon4 allele [67]. Natural antioxidants \nincluding dietary vitamin E may counteract the adverse affect of the apoE4 genotype on oxidative \nstress and chronic inflammation. \n \nFigure 6. Proteins involved in the metabolism of \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-TOH) in the lung. \u03b1 -\ntocopherol is distributed in the body via different lipoproteins and chylomicrons (CM). \nCellular uptake of \u03b1-TOH is mediated by apoE and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and \ntheir binding to several lipoprotein receptors including peripheral tissues (e.g., \nlung)receptor (LDLrec) and LDL receptor related protein 1(LRP1). Intracellular \u03b1-TOH is \nsubjected to mitochondrial degradation by the cytochrome P450 family 3A (CYP3A) \nenzyme subfamily. Delivery of \u03b1-TOH to the alveolar space is facilitated by the activity of \nthe \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein (\u03b1-TTP) and ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1). \nExcessive amounts of \u03b1-TOH may be also excluded via the multidrug resistance \ntransporter 1 (MDR1) (according to [68]). \nCM\nLPLLUNG \n13\u00b4OH-\u03b1-TOH\nHDL\nVLDL\nLIVER\nVLDL LDL\nHL\nLDL\nLDL\napoE4\nBLOOD STREAM\napoE4\napoE4\napoE4\napoE4\napoE4\nMDR1\n\u03b1-TTP\nABCA1\n\u03b1-TOH\n\u03b1-TOH\nALVEOLAR SPACE\nLDLrec\nLRP1\nSR-B1\nCYP3A\napoE4\n\u03b1-TOH\n\u03b1-TOH \u03b1-TOH\n\u03b1-TOH \u03b1-TOH\n\u03b1-TOH\n\u03b1-TOH\n \n \nIn a recent study, we observed significant lower \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in the lung of apoE4 \ncompared with apoE3 transgenic mice. Genes encoding for proteins involved in peripheral  \n\u03b1-tocopherol transport degradation (Figure 6) are affected by the apoE genotype probably accounting \nfor the lower \u03b1-tocopherol tissue concentration as observed in apoE4 mice. Infact, receptors of  \nMolecules 2010, 15                    \n \n \n1756\n\u03b1-tocopherol uptake including scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1), LDL receptor (LDLrec) and LDL \nreceptor related protein 1 (LRP1) were lower in apoE4 as compared to apoE3 mice. Lung mRNA \nlevels of the ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and the multidrug resistance transporter 1 (MDR1), \nsurfactant proteins mediating the export of \u03b1-tocopherol, were lower in apoE4 than in apoE3 mice. In \naddition, the mRNA levels of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), an enzyme family involved in the \ndegradation of \u03b1-tocopherol, tended to be higher in the apoE4 as compared to the apoE3 genotype. \nTaken together our data indicate that the apoE4 may retain less \u03b1-tocopherol in the lung than apoE3 \ngenotype, which may in turn impact on the dietary vitamin E requirement.  \nSimilar to the apoE4 polymorphism, the haptoglobin 2-2 polymorphism is associated with increased \nproduction of reactive oxygen species and decreased tissue levels of vitamin E and importantly, \nvitamin E supplementation (d-\u03b1-tocopherol) appears to reduce cardiovascular events in individuals \nwith diabetes mellitus type 2 and the Hp 2-2 genotype [69]. \nIn this context a so-called personalized nutritional advice may be taken into account where \nindividuals could be given dietary recommendations in terms of vitamin E considering their apoE and \nhaptoglobin genotype [70]. \nThe use of \u2018-omic\u2019technologies, some of which has already been discussed in this article, has \nadvanced the notion of personalized nutrition. Metabolomics, a study of the complement of \nmetabolites in biological samples, has been viewed as having an important role in the development of \na nutritional phenotype for future personalized nutritional assessment [71,72]. Metabolomics offers the \nability to determine how nutrients interact with metabolic pathways [71,73] offering insights into the \ncomplex relationships between diet and metabolism and diet and disease and therefore maybe able to \ndefine novel mechanisms of action. Both targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling approaches can \nbe used to study vitamin E status [74]. Targeted approaches to understand vitamin E physiology and \nmetabolism include the use of stable isotope labeled vitamin E which allows researchers to identify \nfactors that influence vitamin E status in humans including dietary, genetic, lifestyle and metabolic \nfactors [35,75]. Nontargeted metabolomics is used to investigate global metabolite profiles in order to \nidentify novel targets. Interestingly this approach has previously been used to investigate vitamin E \nstatus in murine models. Griffin et al. studied the metabolic deficits and vitamin E deficiency induced \nby neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in a mouse model using metabolomics and revealed how vitamin E \nsupplementation could partially reverse some of the metabolic abnormalities [76]. More recently Cho \net al. demonstrated that activation of the pregnane X receptor attenuated vitamin E metabolism to the \nusual carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (CEHC) form but discovered a novel vitamin E metabolite [77]. \nWe have previously highlighted that metabolomics can be used to provide insights into how vitamin E \ncan influence the human metabolome [74,75] and indeed demonstrated some interesting observations \nfollowing a supplementation regime that are undergoing confirmation. In this regard it may be possible \nto identify novel mechanisms of vitamin E action and greatly expand our knowledge of the activities of \nvitamin E. \n \nReferences and Notes \n1.
