We use the helicity method and include the decay of theW and\nZ-boson into leptons in the narrow-width approximation. In order to integrate over\nthe qq\u00af final state phase space we use an extended version of the subtraction method to\nNNLO and remove collinear singularities explicitly. Due to the large gluon density at\nlow x, the gluon induced terms of vector-boson pair production are expected to be the\ndominant NNLO QCD correction, relevant at LHC energies. However, we show that\ndue to a cancellation they turn out to provide a rather small contribution, anticipating\ngood stability for the perturbative expansion.\n1 Introduction\nA direct test of the non-abelian nature of the weak interactions can be made through\nthe study of vector-boson pair production. These processes already involve triple gauge-\nboson couplings at tree level and, therefore, offer a promising framework for their study.\nIn the Standard Model, the triple gauge-boson couplings are completely fixed by gauge\nsymmetry. However, these couplings can be modified by new physics occurring at\na higher energy scale. Given that the triple gauge-boson couplings have been much\nless precisely measured than, for example, the couplings of gauge bosons to fermions,\nit is natural to search for new physics by looking for anomalous triple gauge-boson\ncouplings.\nTrilinear gauge-boson couplings have been studied at LEP2 [1] and the Tevatron [2].\nIt should be emphasized that the studies at hadron colliders are complementary to\nstudies at electron-positron colliders. While bounds on anomalous couplings obtained\nfrom LEP2 data are more stringent than those from hadron colliders, the latter offer\nthe possibility to study these couplings at a higher centre of mass energy, where effects\nof anomalous couplings are enhanced. The amount of available data from hadron\ncolliders will dramatically increase with the Run II at Tevatron and even more so with\nthe LHC. This will allow the study of triple gauge-boson couplings to be taken one step\nfurther. Of course, all possible vector-boson pair production processes will be analysed.\nHowever, in this paper we concentrate on W\u00b1\u03b3 and W\u00b1Z pair production.\nIn order to get reliable theoretical predictions for vector-boson pair production it\nis important to include higher-order corrections. One-loop QCD corrections, treating\nthe vector bosons as stable particles, were computed for W\u00b1\u03b3 production [3] and\nW\u00b1Z production [4] ten years ago. Since vector bosons are identified through their\ndecay products it is essential to include the decay of the bosons into fermions. This\nallows arbitrary cuts to be added to the kinematics of the final states and therefore\nfacilitates the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental measurements.\nThe calculation of these processes in the narrow-width approximation but retaining\nspin information via decay-angle correlations only in the real part of the amplitudes\nhas been published in [5]. Anomalous couplings for theW\u00b1\u03b3 [6] andW\u00b1Z [7] processes\nhave also been included. Finally, analytic results of the one-loop amplitudes for vector-\nboson pair production with the subsequent decay into lepton pairs in the narrow-width\napproximation have been presented in [8]. In [9, 10] these amplitudes have been used\nto obtain numerical results including all decay-angle correlations. Steps beyond the\ninclusion of O(\u03b1s) corrections in the narrow-width approximation have been made\nin [11], where non-doubly resonant diagrams have been included and in [12], where\none-loop logarithmic electroweak corrections have been calculated.\nThe size of the one-loop QCD corrections depends crucially on the physical quantity\nunder investigation. Usually they are of the order of a few 10%, but in some particularly\ninteresting cases, for example the high pT tail of transverse momentum distributions\nthey can increase the leading order cross section by several 100%. The reason for\n1\nsuch huge corrections is that the next-to-leading order correction to vector-boson pair\nproduction consists of two parts. First, there is the one-loop correction to the leading\norder partonic process qq\u00af \u2192 V V . Second, there are new partonic channels, qg \u2192 V V q,\nthat contribute to the cross section at NLO. Even though these processes are suppressed\nwith respect to the leading order partonic process qq\u00af \u2192 V V by the strong coupling\nconstant \u03b1s, they can easily be more important numerically, since they are enhanced by\nthe gluonic parton distribution function. This is particularly the case for the LHC (or\neven a much higher energy Very Large Hadron Collider, or VLHC), where gluon induced\nprocesses become increasingly dominant. Unfortunately, the kinematical regimes where\nthese contributions are largest are exactly those where effects from anomalous couplings\nare expected to manifest themselves. Therefore, it is important to gain a better control\nof the theoretical predictions in these kinematical regimes.\nOne way to improve the situation is to impose a jet veto. This suppresses the effect\nof the new partonic channels that are opened at higher order [7, 9, 10]. On the other\nhand, such a veto also reduces the amount of data considerably. Another possibility is\nto include even higher order terms. Of course, a full NNLO calculation of vector-boson\npair production is not to be expected in the near future. Such a calculation would\nhave to include two-loop corrections to the partonic subprocesses qq\u00af \u2192 V V , one-loop\ncorrections to qg \u2192 V V q and, finally, (amongst others) processes with gg in the initial\nstate. Motivated by the observation that loop corrections to partonic processes tend to\nbe of the expected moderate size and huge corrections are mainly due to the opening of\nnew channels, in this paper we include all NNLO terms that are maximally enhanced\nby the gluon distribution functions.\nIn general, there are two classes of such contributions. First, there is the process\ngg \u2192 V V . These processes have been studied previously [13]. The amplitude for\nthis process vanishes at tree level but may be non-zero at one-loop. In the case of\nW\u00b1\u03b3 and W\u00b1Z pair production, however, the amplitude for this process vanishes at\nall orders, due to charge conservation. Second, there are the processes gg \u2192 V V qq\u00af.\nThe amplitudes for these processes have been calculated in [14] and have been used\nto compute cross sections for the production of a vector boson pair together with\ntwo jets. We extend this work by not requiring any jets to be observed in the final\nstate. Hence, the amplitudes gg \u2192 V V qq\u00af have to be integrated over the qq\u00af final state\nphase space. This results in infrared singularities that will have to be absorbed in\nthe parton distribution functions. Furthermore, we also extend the previous work by\nadding anomalous couplings.\nWe find that the contribution of the gluon induced processes to WZ and W\u03b3\nproduction is smaller than may have been anticipated, due to a sign change in the\nhard scattering part. We also find that this NNLO term is affected less by anomalous\ncouplings than the corresponding LO and NLO terms.\n2\n2 Calculation\nVector boson pair production has been calculated up to NLO in the helicity method.\nHowever, in an NLO calculation for pp\u2192 WZ, whilst the process q\u00afq \u2192WZ is included\nat NLO, the process qg \u2192WZq is only calculated at LO. This means that we only have\na leading order calculation in the circumstances where gluon-induced subprocesses are\nimportant, as they are expected to be at the LHC due to the large gluon density at\nlow x. Therefore we want to include the next order in \u03b1s, the process gg \u2192 WZqq\u00af\n(and similarly for W\u03b3).\nFor W\u2212Z production we will use the labelling g1 g2 l3 \u03bd\u00af4 l\u00af\n\u2032\n5 l\n\u2032\n6 q7 q\u00af8, where g1 and g2\nare the incoming gluons, leptons 3 and 4 are the decay products of the W and 5 and 6\nare from the Z. Clearly, W\u03b3 will have one less particle but this is a trivial modification.\nIt is also straightforward to transform the calculation for other vector bosons.\nIn calculating gg \u2192WZ, we use a version of the subtraction method [15] to cancel\nthe infrared singularities analytically and evaluate the finite remainders numerically.\nWe show the finite parts of the cross section in equations (8), (11) and (15).\nA generic differential cross section is written as:\nd\u03c3AB(pA, pB) =\n\u2211\nab\n\u222b\ndx1 dx2 fa\/A(xA)fb\/B(xB) d\u03c3\u02c6ab(xApA, xBpB) , (1)\nwhere A and B are hadrons while a and b are partons and fa\/A and fb\/B are the\nparton distribution functions. The subtracted partonic cross section, d\u03c3\u02c6, is finite for\nany infrared safe observable.\nIn a general case, in order to obtain d\u03c3\u02c6, soft and final state collinear singulari-\nties have to be cancelled with the singularities coming from virtual corrections. The\nremaining initial state collinear singularities have to be factored out into the parton\ndistribution functions. In an extension of the subtraction method to NNLO, this de-\nmands the subtraction of all possible singularities as well as their analytical integration\nin the corresponding limits. Up to now, such a general framework has not been devel-\noped. Only a limited number of analytical calculations to NNLO accuracy have been\nperformed.\nThe main difficulty for the implementation of a subtraction procedure at NNLO is\nthe appearance of several new (multiple parton) kinematical configurations where soft\nand\/or collinear singularities arise. These are: the triple collinear case (three partons\nbecome collinear), the double soft case (two partons are soft), the soft-collinear case\n(one parton is soft and the other collinear) and the double collinear case (two pairs of\npartons are independently collinear). The single soft and collinear singularities, which\nappear also at NLO, have to be added to that list.\nEven though the behaviour of tree and one-loop amplitudes in those limits has been\nrecently obtained [16], it is not yet clear how to unify all singularities in a single subtrac-\ntion term, or how to subtract all of them independently while avoiding double counting\nand allowing the analytical integration of the subtracted terms to be performed.\n3\nOur case, however, is particularly simple. Since we include only gg induced pro-\ncesses at NNLO there are no final state collinear singularities (see below about final\nstate singularities in the W\u03b3 case). There are also no soft singularities, since there are\nno gluons (or qq\u00af pairs) in the final state. Therefore, the only singularities that arise\nare the single collinear ones, which can be treated in a similar way as a typical NLO\ncalculation, and the double collinear ones, i.e., the collinear splitting of each initial\nstate gluon into a qq\u00af pair, a \u2018genuine\u2019 NNLO contribution.\nIn order to absorb the remaining initial state collinear singularities we use\nfa\/d = \u03b4ad\u03b4(1\u2212 x)\u2212 \u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPad(x, 0)\u2212\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n)2\nQad(x) . (2)\nThis is the NNLO expression in MS and as usual we define 1\n\u01eb\u00af\n\u2261 1\n\u01eb\n\u2212 \u03b3E + log 4\u03c0.\nPad(x, 0) is the one-loop Altarelli-Parisi splitting function for \u03b5 = 0 (4 dimensions).\nThe O(\u03b12s) term Qad, including contributions from the two-loop splitting functions,\ndoes not actually contribute in our case.\nComparing subtracted and unsubtracted terms and using eq. (2), we obtain the\nrelation:\nd\u03c3\u02c6(2)gg (k1, k2) = d\u03c3\n(2)\ngg (k1, k2)\n+\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\ndx1\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPqg(x1)\n)\nd\u03c3(1)qg (x1k1, k2) +\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\ndx1\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPq\u00afg(x1)\n)\nd\u03c3\n(1)\nq\u00afg (x1k1, k2)\n+\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\ndx2\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPqg(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3(1)gq (k1, x2k2) +\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\ndx2\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPq\u00afg(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3\n(1)\ngq\u00af (k1, x2k2)\n+\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n)2 \u222b\ndx1dx2\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPqg(x1)\n)(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPq\u00afg(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3\n(0)\nqq\u00af (x1k1, x2k2)\n+\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n)2 \u222b\ndx1dx2\n(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPq\u00afg(x1)\n)(\n1\n\u01eb\u00af\nPqg(x2)\n)\nd\u03c3\n(0)\nq\u00afq (x1k1, x2k2) , (3)\nwhere k1, k2 are the momenta of the incoming gluons 1 and 2. The superscript (2)\ndenotes the NNLO term, while (1) is NLO and (0) is leading order. In eq. (3) all terms\non the right hand side are separately divergent but the sum is finite.\nOnce we have this expression, we can write out the counterterms in terms of en-\nergy and angle variables and cancel the poles explicitly. Following [15] we use the\nparameterisation\nk1 =\n\u221a\ns12\n2\n(1,~0, 1) (4)\nk2 =\n\u221a\ns12\n2\n(1,~0,\u22121) (5)\nki =\n\u221a\ns12\n2\n\u03bei\n(\n1,\n\u221a\n1\u2212 y2i ~eT , yi\n)\n, (6)\nwhere ki is the momentum of an outgoing (anti)quark, ~eT is a unit vector in transverse\nmomentum space, yi = cos \u03b8i is the angle variable \u22121 \u2264 yi \u2264 1 and \u03bei is the rescaled\n4\nenergy variable 0 \u2264 \u03bei \u2264 1. Performing part of the phase-space integration analytically\nwe can rewrite eq. (3) as a sum of three separately finite pieces\nd\u03c3\u02c6(2)gg = d\u03c3\n(fin,8) + d\u03c3(fin,7) + d\u03c3(fin,6) , (7)\nwith terms d\u03c3(fin,8,7,6) denoting the 8,7 and 6-parton finite parts.

(10)\nThe two P distributions in eq.(8) perform the subtraction of both double and single\ncollinear singularities of NNLO amplitudes, leaving a (numerically) integrable remnant.\nThe 7-parton finite part reads\nd\u03c3(fin,7) =\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n(\nL7P<qg(1\u2212 \u03be7)\u2212 P \u2032<qg (1\u2212 \u03be7)\n)\n(1\u2212 y28){\nM(7)q\u00afg ((1\u2212 \u03be7)k1, k2, {ki}3,6, k8) +M(7)gq\u00af (k1, (1\u2212 \u03be7)k2, {ki}3,6, k8)\n}\ns12\n8(2\u03c0)3\n\u03be8P(y8) d\u03be7 d\u03be8 dy8 d\u03d58 d\u03a6(3\u22126)\n+\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n(\nL8P<q\u00afg(1\u2212 \u03be8)\u2212 P \u2032<q\u00afg (1\u2212 \u03be8)\n)\n(1\u2212 y27){\nM(7)qg ((1\u2212 \u03be8)k1, k2, {ki}3,6, k7) +M(7)gq (k1, (1\u2212 \u03be8)k2, {ki}3,6, k7)}\ns12\n8(2\u03c0)3\n\u03be7P(y7) d\u03be7 d\u03be8 dy7 d\u03d57 d\u03a6(3\u22126) , (11)\nwhere we introduced\nL7 = log s12 \u03b4I \u03be\n2\n7\n2\u00b52\nL8 = log s12 \u03b4I \u03be\n2\n8\n2\u00b52\n, (12)\n5\nand split up the unregularized Altarelli-Parisi function into the 4-dimensional piece,\nP<ad, and the piece proportional to \u03b5, P\n\u2032<\nad . For completeness we give the explicit form\nP<qg(1\u2212 \u03bei) =\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 2\u03bei + 2\u03be2i ) (13)\nP \u2032<qg (1\u2212 \u03bei) = \u03bei(\u03bei \u2212 1) . (14)\nIn this case, the single collinear singularities of the NLO amplitudes are subtracted by\nthe appearance of a single P distribution.\nFinally, the 6-parton finite piece is given by\nd\u03c3(fin,6) =\n(\n\u03b1s\n2\u03c0\n)2 (\nL7P<qg(1\u2212 \u03be7)\u2212 P \u2032<qg (1\u2212 \u03be7)\n) (\nL8P<q\u00afg(1\u2212 \u03be8)\u2212 P \u2032<q\u00afg (1\u2212 \u03be8)\n)\n{\nM(6)q\u00afq\n(\n(1\u2212 \u03be7)k1, (1\u2212 \u03be8)k2, {ki}(3,6)\n)\n+M(6)qq\u00af\n(\n(1\u2212 \u03be8)k1, (1\u2212 \u03be7)k2, {ki}(3,6)\n) }\nd\u03be7 d\u03be8 d\u03a6(3\u22126) . (15)\nWe note that \u03b4I is an arbitrary quantity and even though d\u03c3\n(fin,8), d\u03c3(fin,7) and\nd\u03c3(fin,6) depend on it, this dependence cancels exactly in d\u03c3\u02c6(2)gg . Hence, making sure\nthat the numerical results are independent of \u03b4I is a useful check for our Monte Carlo\nprogram.\nIn calculating the cross section as above, we use 6 parton and 7 parton amplitudes\nas given in [8]. We also require the 8 and 7 parton amplitudes for gg \u2192 qq\u00afWZ and\ngg \u2192 qq\u00afW\u03b3 respectively. These amplitudes have been calculated previously [14]. We\nrecalculated these amplitudes using the helicity method and including anomalous cou-\nplings. For the triple gauge vertex forW+\u03b1 (p+)W\n\u2212(p\u2212)\u03b2V\u00b5(q), including the anomalous\nterms, we use\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5WWV (p+, p\u2212, q) =\n(\n(p+ \u2212 q)\u03b1g\u03b2\u00b51\n2\n(gV1 + \u03ba\nV + \u03bbV\np2\n\u2212\nM2W\n)\n+(q \u2212 p\u2212)\u03b2g\u03b1\u00b51\n2\n(gV1 + \u03ba\nV + \u03bbV\np2+\nM2W\n)\n+(p+ \u2212 p\u2212)\u00b5(\u2212g\u03b1\u03b2 1\n2\nq2\n\u03bbV\nM2W\n+\n\u03bbV\nM2W\nq\u03b1q\u03b2)\n)\n, (16)\nwhere V can be Z or \u03b3 and all momenta are taken to be outgoing. In the Standard\nModel, gV1 = \u03ba\nV = 1 and \u03bbV = 0. In order to preserve electromagnetic gauge invariance\nwe always set g\u03b31 to the Standard Model value 1.\nWe also make use of form factors to avoid the violation of unitarity that would\notherwise result from this vertex at high energies. The form factors used is are the\nconventional ones:\n\u2206gV1 \u2192\n\u2206gV1\n(1 + s\u02c6\/\u039b2)2\n, \u2206\u03baV \u2192 \u2206\u03ba\nV\n(1 + s\u02c6\/\u039b2)2\n, \u2206\u03bbV \u2192 \u2206\u03bb\nV\n(1 + s\u02c6\/\u039b2)2\n(17)\n6\nwhere \u039b is the scale of the new physics that causes the anomalous couplings.\nPhotons with large transverse momentum can be produced in hadronic collisions not\nonly directly, but also, and significantly, from the fragmentation of a final state parton.\nA full perturbative calculation of a process involving the production of photons should\nin principle include the calculation of both direct and fragmentation components, since\nonly their sum is physically well defined beyond LO. A calculation of the fragmentation\npart is not even available at NLO for the process of interest in this paper. Fortunately\nthere is a way to suppress the fragmentation contribution, which actually constitutes\na background to the search of anomalous couplings, by requiring the photons to be\nisolated from the hadrons. The usual way to perform the isolation is to require the\ntransverse hadronic momentum in a cone around the photon to be smaller than a\nfraction of the transverse momentum of the photon. In this way, the contribution\nof the fragmentation component can be reduced to the percent level. In this paper,\nwe will use the isolation procedure introduced by Frixione [17] which allows us to\ncompletely suppress the fragmentation component. Therefore, we reject all events\nunless the transverse hadronic momentum deposited in a cone of size R0 around the\nmomentum of the photon fulfills the following condition\n\u2211\ni\npT i \u03b8(R\u2212 Ri\u03b3) \u2264 pT\u03b3\n(\n1\u2212 cosR\n1\u2212 cosR0\n)\n, (18)\nfor all R \u2264 R0, where the \u2018distance\u2019 in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle is defined\nby Ri\u03b3 =\n\u221a\n(\u03b7i \u2212 \u03b7\u03b3)2 + (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6\u03b3)2. In this way, only soft partons can be emitted\ncollinearly to the photon in the direct contribution and, therefore, no final state quark-\nphoton collinear singularity arises. For the purposes of our computation this allows us\nto perform the calculation of the gg initiated contribution at NNLO without needing\nto do any subtraction of the corresponding singularity. While the possibility of per-\nforming such isolation at the experimental level is under investigation, the choice of\nthis particular method will not alter at all the conclusions of our calculation in the W\u03b3\nchannel. Particularly, we have checked that the results at NLO using the procedure\nin eq.(18) are very close to the ones obtained performing the usual \u2018cone\u2019 isolation\nprocedure [10].\nIn this calculation, contributions from b and t quarks have been neglected. It is\nassumed that these will be suppressed by the large top quark mass. This might not be\na particularly good approximation for large energies, but in view of the smallness of\nthe gluon induced corrections a more detailed treatment doesn\u2019t seem to be justified.\n3 Numerical Results\nFor the numerical results presented in this section we use the MRST 2001 parton\ndistribution functions [19] with the one-loop expression for the coupling constant\n(\u03b1s(MZ) = 0.119). The factorization and renormalization scales are fixed to \u00b5F =\n\u221a\ns\u02c6,\n7\n\u00b5R =\n\u221a\n1\n2\n(M2W +M\n2\nZ) +\n1\n2\n(p2T W + p\n2\nT Z) in the case of WZ production and to \u00b5F =\n\u00b5R =\n\u221a\nM2W + p\n2\nT \u03b3 in the W\u03b3 case. Notice that in order to compute the gg induced\ncontribution we also use the same NLO combination of parton distribution function\nand coupling constant. The effect of changing to NNLO parton distributions, not fully\navailable yet, is expected to be small and will not alter the conclusion of our analysis.\nThe masses of the vector bosons have been set to MZ = 91.187 GeV and MW =\n80.41 GeV. We do not include any electroweak corrections, but choose the coupling\nconstants \u03b1 and sin2 \u03b8W in the spirit of the improved Born approximation [20]. For the\ncouplings of the vector bosons with the quarks we use \u03b1 = \u03b1(MZ) = 1\/128 whereas\nfor the photon coupling we use \u03b1 = 1\/137. We neglect contributions from initial state\ntop quarks and use the following values for the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix\nelements: |Vud| = |Vcs| = 0.975 and |Vus| = |Vcd| = 0.222. Note that we do not include\nthe branching ratios for the decay of the vector bosons into leptons.\nFor all plots we use a set of standard cuts. For charged leptons we require pT >\n20 GeV and \u03b7 < 2.5. In addition, we require a missing transverse momentum pmissT >\n20 GeV. The photon transverse momentum cut we use is p\u03b3T > 20 GeV, while for the\nisolation prescription in eq. (18) we set R0 = 1.\nFigure 1: Partonic cross sections for W\u03b3: \u03c3\u02c6qq\u00af, \u03c3\u02c6qg and \u03c3\u02c6gg.\nIn Figures 1 and 2 we show the MS subtracted partonic cross sections for the\ndifferent initial states qq\u00af, qg and gg. These are produced by binning the results at 14\nTeV by\n\u221a\ns\u02c6. It can be seen that the outcomes for W\u03b3 and WZ are very similar. For\nbetter visibility \u03c3\u02c6gg has been increased by a factor 10 in the plot.\nAs can be observed, there is a reasonably good perturbative convergence at the\nlevel of the partonic cross section, considering that \u03c3\u02c6qq\u00af is of O(1 + \u03b1s), \u03c3\u02c6qg of O(\u03b1s),\n8\nFigure 2: Partonic cross sections for WZ: \u03c3\u02c6qq\u00af, \u03c3\u02c6qg and \u03c3\u02c6gg\nand \u03c3\u02c6gg of O(\u03b12s), with \u03b1s \u223c 0.1 for the typical scales of these processes. In the MS\nboth the qq\u00af and qg contributions are positive in the whole range of s\u02c6, while the new\npiece, the gg partonic cross section becomes negative only for small values of s\u02c6, close\nto the threshold for the production of the vector bosons.\nThe situation changes considerably when the physical hadronic cross section is\ncomputed, shown in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 3 we plot the transverse momentum\ndistribution of the photon, whereas in Figure 4 we see the pT of the lepton produced\nby the decay of the W . Again the form of the distributions is very similar for the WZ\nas compared to the W\u03b3 case.\nAs indicated in the introduction, because of the large qg luminosity, the hadronic\ncontribution due to this initial state becomes even larger than the \u2018leading\u2019 qq\u00af contri-\nbution. This is particularly clear at large transverse momentum, where the relative\nincrease in the luminosity exceeds the effect of the suppression due to the extra \u03b1s\ncoupling observed at the partonic level. This is not the case for the gg contribution,\nwhich remains rather small, and for the observable studied here provides a negative\ncontribution to the hadronic cross section.\nThe features of both qg and gg contributions to WZ and W\u03b3 production can be\nqualitatively understood in the following way: the qg and gg luminosities are steep\nfunctions of the momentum fraction carried by the partons, mostly due to the fast\nincrease of the gluon distribution g(x) when x decreases. Even though the hadronic\ncenter of mass energy S is very large, the average value of the partonic one \u3008s\u02c6\u3009 =\n\u3008x1x2\u3009S can be considerably smaller, and actually closer to the minimum needed to\nproduce the gauge bosons with the required transverse momentum. Therefore in the\nconvolution between the parton distributions and the partonic cross sections shown in\n9\nFigure 3: W\u03b3 production: pT distribution for LHC, qq\u00af, qg and gg pieces separately\nFigures 1 and 2, the hadronic result will mostly pick up the features of the partonic\ncross section at low values of s\u02c6. In the qg case, the partonic cross section is positive\nand has its maximum at low s\u02c6, giving as a result a large hadronic contribution. In\nthe gg case, the partonic cross section has a change of sign at low values of s\u02c6, with\nthe corresponding compensation between negative and positive contributions when\nconvoluting with the parton densities. Therefore the gg hadronic contribution results\nin a negative and small correction to the NLO cross section.\nFigure 4: WZ production: pT distribution for LHC, qq\u00af, qg and gg pieces separately\nIn order to investigate whether the inclusion of anomalous couplings changes this\n10\npicture substantially, we show in Figure 5 the partonic cross sections with the following\nanomalous couplings:\ng\u03b31 = 1; g\nZ\n1 = 1.13; \u03ba\n\u03b3 = 1.2; \u03baZ = 1.07; \u03bb\u03b3 = \u03bbZ = 0.1 (19)\nWe use the form factors as given in eq. (17) and we take \u039b, the scale of new physics, to\nbe 2 TeV. Figure 5 is given with the same scale as Figure 2 for comparison. It is clear\nthat, with the values for the couplings that we have chosen, we do not see a significant\nenhancement of the gluon induced term. In fact, the gluon induced corrections become\neven less relevant, as the qg and especially the qq\u00af terms are increased substantially.\nFigure 5: Partonic cross section \u03c3\u02c6qq\u00af, \u03c3\u02c6qg and \u03c3\u02c6gg for WZ production with anomalous\ncouplings as given in eq. (19)\nIn addition to these results, we also considered a hypothetical VLHC or Very Large\nHadron Collider, which would run at a centre of mass energy of 200 TeV, to see whether\nthe gg part would become significant at the higher energy (cuts etc. all remained the\nsame as previously). It was found that the gg part did not become more important.\nThe contributions from the gg term remained at the 1% level.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have presented expressions for the finite cross section for vector-boson pair produc-\ntion from a gluon-gluon initial state. We have then implemented these terms and the\nappropriate matrix elements into a Monte Carlo integration.\nWe find the contribution of the gluon induced terms in WZ and W\u03b3 production\nto be surprisingly small. Even the addition of anomalous couplings enhances the gg\ninduced term substantially less than the qq\u00af and qg terms. We have shown that this is\ndue to a change of sign in the hard scattering.\n11\nThis is a good result from the point of view of experimental predictions of vector-\nboson pair production, at least in the WZ and W\u03b3 cases, as the impact of NNLO\nterms does not appear to be particularly significant. It also seems that the gg term\nwill not be amplified excessively by anomalous couplings, though we have only taken\nan example of anomalous couplings and have not made a detailed study.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partly supported by the EU Fourth Framework Programme \u2018Train-\ning and Mobility of Researchers\u2019, Network \u2018Quantum Chromodynamics and the Deep\nStructure of Elementary Particles\u2019, contract FMRX-CT98-0194 (DG 12 - MIHT) and\nby the EU Fifth Framework Programme \u2018Improving Human Potential\u2019, Research Train-\ning Network \u2018Particle Physics Phenomenology at High Energy Colliders\u2019, contract\nHPRN-CT-2000-00149.
