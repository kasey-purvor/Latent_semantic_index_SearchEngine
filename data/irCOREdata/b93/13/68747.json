In \nthis paper we discuss the scope for introducing reforms similar to the \nUK\u2019s \u201cquasi-market\u201d model. Firstly, we discuss the role of school league \ntables in providing signals and incentives within a quasi-market model. \nSpecifically, we compare a range of unadjusted and model-based league \ntables of primary school performance in Queensland\u2019s public education \nsystem. These comparisons indicate that model-based tables that account \nfor socio-economic status and student intake quality vary significantly \nfrom the unadjusted tables. Secondly, we test for school competition \neffects in the existing regulated education market. The results indicate that \ncompetition between government schools has a positive effect on school \nefficiency while competition from the non-government sector has a \nnegative effect.   \n \n  \n \n     \n 3\n \n1 INTRODUCTION \n \nThe debate about the appropriate method of providing mass education has a long history \nand has focused on the merits of alternative state and market-based approaches. A trend \ntowards increased state provision of education was evident until the late 1970s and early \n1980s when \u201cNew Right\u201d governments in the US, UK and elsewhere began to introduce \nreforms that emphasised a greater role for market forces. As Tooley (1996) notes, \ngovernments can intervene in education by regulating its content (e.g.: with respect to \ncurriculum and testing), its demand (through compulsory attendance laws), and through \ndetermining the level of funding and provision. State-based provision is generally \ncharacterised as a situation where the government funds \u201cfree\u201d schooling from general \ntaxation revenue and centrally administers the education system according to non-market \ncriteria. This model is thought to be effective at internalising the social benefits of \neducation, such as citizenship, support for democratic institutions and knowledge \nspillovers1. Most importantly, it is argued that state provision of education is needed to \navoid the greater social segregation and income inequality that would eventuate in a \nmarket-based system.              \n \nIn contrast, advocates of market-based approaches to education argue that inequality of \neducational opportunity will exist even under a centralised system of state provision \n(Chubb and Moe 1988, Smith and Tomlinson 1989). Furthermore, it is argued that state \nprovision is associated with higher levels of technical and allocative inefficiency. In turn, \nthe existence of these inefficiencies leads to a lower level of resources and services, \nthereby limiting the scope to reduce educational inequality and under-achievement \n(Hoxby 1996).      \n \n In Australia, the debate on the role of market forces and state provision in the education \nsystem has intensified in recent years. Most notably, there has been an ongoing, high-\nprofile debate on the funding of non-government schools and the efficacy of \u201cvoucher\u201d-\n 4\ntype mechanisms in allocating funding between private and state-run schools \n(Buckingham 2000, Macklin 2002). However, there have been two other significant \npolicy developments in the organisation of primary and secondary education in Australia. \nFirstly, in 1998 the Coalition Government (under then Education Minister David Kemp) \nmandated the introduction of standardised literacy and numeracy testing across Australian \nprimary schools. Comprehensive testing programmes were introduced for students at the \nYear 3, 5 and 7 level in order to measure progress on nationally agreed benchmarks for \nliteracy and numeracy skills2. This reform was significant because it overcame the \npolitical resistance to the use of testing as a major performance indicator that existed \namong some stakeholders in the education sector.  \n \nSecondly, in the wake of the Kemp reforms, state governments have begun to make use \nof test-score and other data in allocating funds and organising service delivery. In \nparticular, the Victorian government has recently taken a major step in releasing school-\nlevel information on Year 12 academic results and other school characteristics to the \npublic. This means that, for the first time in Australia, parents, the media and other \ninterested parties are able to construct \u201cleague tables\u201d of relative school achievement. \nIndeed, the Victorian government\u2019s move was welcomed by the media and gained some \npopularity with the general public for this reason (Yaman and Nason 2002).         \n \nThese developments are reminiscent of reforms to the British education system in the late \n1980s and early 1990s. The Thatcher Government\u2019s 1988 Education Reform Act ushered \nin the most important series of changes to the organisation of state education in Britain \nsince the 1944 Education Act. The government\u2019s aim was to liberalise the provision of \npublic education and promote the concepts of parental choice, school competition and \nmanagerial decentralisation. A number of policy measures were implemented to facilitate \nthis agenda including: the introduction of pupil-based formula funding, the publication of \nschool examination results (\u201cleague tables\u201d), the establishment of a powerful school \ninspection agency and the promotion of school-level governance. However, these reforms \nare best described as a market-oriented modification of the system of public provision \n 5\nrather than a full privatisation of the education system a la a voucher model. Le Grand \n(1991) and others (Bradley et al 2000, Glennerster 1991) have therefore characterised the \nBritish system as a \u201cquasi-market\u201d where market mechanisms play a significant role in \ndetermining the economic efficiency of a publicly provided education system. \n \nIn Australia, the emergence of a national testing system and the public release of school-\nlevel academic results raises the possibility of future market-oriented reforms. Therefore, \nin this paper we analyse the performance of Australian schools and reflect on what \nlessons can be learnt from the British experience with quasi-markets. Specifically, we \nmeasure the technical efficiency of a large sample of Queensland primary schools using \nthe method of data envelopment analysis (DEA), a common approach in the education \neconomics literature (Worthington 2001). In turn, we use the results of this analysis to \ndiscuss the determinants of school performance and the efficacy of using publicly \navailable \u201cleague tables\u201d of school-level achievement to facilitate parental choice and \ncompetitive discipline in the education system. Such league tables are a major component \nof the quasi-market policy framework and an analysis of how they signal school quality \nand promote competition is of vital interest to Australian policy debates.   \n \nIndeed, our analysis indicates that a simple, \u201cunadjusted\u201d league tables system has the \npotential to have both perverse and beneficial effects on the efficiency of the education \nsystem. The balance of these effects hinges on the extent to which \u201craw\u201d league tables \nconvey information about school efficiency or quality. The results of our DEA models \nindicate that league tables based on average scores do not adequately reflect the influence \nof socio-economic factors and student intake quality on school performance. In turn, we \nconclude that any Australian quasi-market model utilising league tables must be designed \nin a detailed \u201cevidence-based\u201d fashion that balances the dynamic costs and benefits of \nintroducing market mechanisms.    \n \nWe believe that this comparison with the British system is justified for a number of \nreasons. Firstly, the direction of current policy developments (particularly the Victorian \n 6\nreforms) indicates that Australian governments are more likely to change the education \nsystem in ways that are consistent with a quasi-market rather than a \u201cschool-choice\u201d \nmodel3. Secondly, the idea of quasi-markets has received high-profile attention from \nmembers of both sides of politics who are interested the interface between markets and \ngovernment (Abbot 2000, Botsman and Latham 2002). Despite this interest, academic \nresearch in Australia that explicitly addresses these issues has been limited.  Thirdly, \nattempts at microeconomic reform in other sectors of the economy have been plagued by \ndesign and implementation problems (Quiggin 1996). Detailed research on school \nperformance is therefore needed to prevent reform proceeding in an ill-conceived or \npiecemeal fashion. \n \nThis paper is organised as follows. Firstly, we review the evidence on the British quasi-\nmarket with a special reference to its institutional structure. In turn, we use this review to \nmotivate some specific questions for the analysis of school performance in Australia. The \nthird section outlines the methodology of the study with respect to educational production \nfunctions and the use of data envelopment (DEA) analysis. Fourth, we discuss the results \nof our DEA analysis with special reference to the influence of socio-economic variables \nand student intake quality. Finally, we review the policy implications of the study with \nrespect to the use of school league tables, arguably the central component of the quasi-\nmarket model.     \n \n2 EVIDENCE ON QUASI-MARKETS IN EDUCATION \n \nThe British quasi-market in education evolved as the result of a collection of policy \nchanges in the late 1980s and early 1990s rather than as the outcome of a detailed, pre-\nconceived plan. Table 1 provides an overview of quasi-market forces in terms of factors \nsuch as decentralisation, incentives, information, choice and voice. This allows us to \nidentify the major components of the quasi-market along with their main functions. For \nexample, the introduction of formula funding (based on age-weighted pupil numbers) and \nopen enrolment was instrumental in exposing the distribution of schooling resources to \n 7\nthe forces of demand and supply. Local school management and governance \ncomplemented this by facilitating decentralisation and allowing schools to differentiate \nthemselves in terms of services and quality. Arguably, the publication of school \nperformance tables was the most significant change. It provided parents with information \non school quality (broadly defined) and schools with an incentive to improve their \nacademic performance. In combination with the other reforms, this promoted competition \nbetween schools and was a major driver of performance improvement in the education \nsystem during the 1990s (Bradley et al 2000).   \n \nEarly discussions of the quasi-market raised the concern that market mechanisms could \namplify inequality in the education system (Glennerster 1991) and this continues to be a \ntheme in applied research on the topic. Firstly, it has become clear that schools have \nresponded to the quasi-market reforms in ways consistent with the operation of market \nforces (Bradley et al 2000). Most notably, the introduction of quasi-market forces affected \nthe allocation of pupils between schools. For example, the dependence of new student \nadmissions on the comparative exam performance of schools increased in the first four \nyears of the quasi-market. This indicates that parental choice was influenced by school \nperformance, as reported by the published league tables. Furthermore, school sizes \nfluctuated in patterns consistent with increased competition \u2013 high performing schools \n(measured in terms of exam performance) expanded in size while less effective schools \nlost enrolments (Bradley and Taylor 1998).     \n \nIn regard to equity, a further analysis by Bradley and Taylor (2002) found that social \nsegregation in the composition of schools increased under the quasi-market. Again, high-\nperforming schools experienced a reduction in the number of pupils coming from less \nwealthy families while less successful schools experienced the opposite effect. However, \nthe presence of competitive forces also appeared to be related to a significant \nimprovement in performance, as measured by exam results. Other research focusing on \nsocial segregation has shown that parents are sensitive to differences in school \n 8\nperformance, as reflected by house prices (Cheshire and Shepard 2002, Gibbons and \nMachin 2001).      \n \nSpecific aspects of the quasi-market\u2019s contribution to widening inequality have been \naddressed in a number of studies (Adnett and Davies 2002, Goldstein and Spiegelhalter  \n1996, Mayston 2000, Wilson 2003).  The role of league tables has been a major theme in \nthis research. In particular, these studies have emphasised how the measures used in the \nSchool Performance Tables and other indicators work to exert competitive pressure \nwithin the quasi-market. Different performance indicators create different incentives for \n\u201cgaming the system\u201d, that is, adjusting schooling policies to maximise test scores \nindirectly rather than value-adding to the skills of every student. For example, schools can \noperate \u201ccream-skimming\u201d policies where they are selective with either their intake of \nstudents or with their choice of which students undertake key exams. Furthermore, the \nspecification of particular performance targets and benchmarks also encourages schools \nto concentrate on the education of students just below or above these targets in order to \nmaximise average school performance. This has the potential to skew resources and effort \naway from students at alternate ends of the ability distribution.  \n \nArguably, the key message of this critique of the quasi-market is that adverse institutional \nincentives can alter the relationship between maximisation of school performance and the \ndevelopment of student\u2019s human capital. This makes the identification of such adverse \nincentives and behavioural responses a key policy issue.  \n \nRecent reforms undertaken at the state and federal level in Australia have parallels with \nthe development of the UK quasi-market. The Kemp reforms in the area of literacy and \nnumeracy testing have created a new source of academic output measures for use in \nperformance appraisal and resource allocation models. More recently, the Victorian \ngovernment\u2019s initiative of releasing school-level academic performance indicators is \nreminiscent of the initial School Performance Tables system in the UK. In particular, the \nVictorian tables report raw or unadjusted indicators, that is, they do not control for the \n 9\nheterogenous backgrounds and abilities of students across schools. This problem applies \neven for the \u201ctransition profile\u201d of post Year 12 destinations that is reported as part of the \nVictorian model (see Table2). As the critique outlined above suggests, this approach can \nlimit the effectiveness of quasi-market mechanisms. In turn, we can pose two practical \nquestions for the consideration of quasi-markets in the Australian education system. \nFirstly, how well do unadjusted league tables perform as signals of school performance, \ngiven the important role of socio-economic status and student intake quality ? And \nsecondly, to what extent are market forces \u2013 particularly those related to school \ncompetition - already operating in Australia\u2019s regulated education system?   \n \n3 METHODOLOGY AND DATA \nMethodology \n \nThe methodology of our study is based on the estimation of an educational production \nfunction for schools using the frontier measurement technique of data envelopment \nanalysis (DEA). This is a useful approach since it allows us to discuss the educational \nproduction function (EPF) in the context of a method that has a firm foundation in neo-\nclassical production economics.   \n \nFollowing Hanushek (1979:354) educational production functions are \u201cgenerally \nstatistical analyses relating observed student outcomes to the characteristics of students, \ntheir families, and other students in the school, as well as the characteristics of schools\u201d. \nThe majority of EPF studies use some type of standardised test score as their measure of \noutput. However, it is also possible to incorporate other types of outcomes as outputs, for \nexample, student absence rates, success in tertiary entrance or student satisfaction. At the \nschool-level, the production function describes how schools transform student inputs into \nthe specified output. A school-level production function can be defined as follows: \n( ) ( ) ( )( )itititiit ISPBfA ,,,=     (1) \nwhere for the ith school, Ait = average achievement at time t; Bit = a vector of inputs \nrelated to the average family background characteristics of students (cumulative to time \n 10\nt); Sit = a cumulative vector of school inputs (e.g.: resources, teacher quality), Pit = a \nvector of average peer influences operating among students at the school, cumulative to \ntime t; and Ii = a vector representing the average level of innate or prior ability of the \nstudents at the school.         \n \nThe technical relationships expressed in this production function can then be translated \ninto a framework based on efficiency measurement (Coelli et al 1998, Worthington \n2001). The three central concepts here are technical, allocative and productive efficiency. \nThese concepts are illustrated in Figure 1 for the output-oriented case involving two \noutputs (y1 and y2) and one input (x1). The production possibilities curve is represented by \nZZ\u2019 which gives the combination of outputs for a given levels of input. The firm A \noperates below the production possibilities frontier such that the distance AB represents \ntechnical inefficiency. Practically, this can be interpreted as the amount by which outputs \ncould be increased without additional inputs. Using price information, we can draw an \nisorevenue line as DD\u2019. The distance BC can then be interpreted as the extent of \nallocative inefficiency since it represents the cost reductions that could occur if \nproduction took place at the economically efficient point B\u2019. Total economic efficiency \nequals the sum of technical and allocative efficiency, defined either as a ratio (0A\/0C) or \nas a distance representing economic inefficiency (AC).     \n \nLinear programming methods can then be used to construct a non-parametric piece-wise \nfrontier or surface with efficiency measures calculated relative to this surface. Given data \non K inputs and M outputs for N firms, we represent these as a column vectors xi and yi \nfor the ith firm. Then for each firm we obtain a measure of outputs over all inputs, such as \nu\u2019yi \/ v\u2019xi where u is an M\u00d71 vector of output weights and v is K\u00d71 vector of input \nweights. Optimal weights can then be found by solving the multiplier problem:  \n   ( )ivu yu'max ,  \n                    st   1' =ixv ,         (2) \n   ,0'' \u2264\u2212 jj xvyu  \n 11\n   0, \u2265vu        \n   \nAn equivalent duality result can be derived as an envelopment problem: \n\u03b8\u03bb\u03b8 ,min  \n                                     st   0\u2265+\u2212 \u03bbYy i     \n0\n0\n\u2265\n\u2265\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\u03b8 Xxi\n \nwhere \u03b8 is a scalar and \u03bb is a N\u00d71 vector of constants. The value of \u03b8 obtained from this \nproblem represents the efficiency score for the i-th firm where \u03b8 = 1 denotes a fully \nefficient firm operating on the production frontier. The linear programming problem is \nsolved for every firm to construct a piece-wise linear isoquant that is consistent with the \ncase of constant returns to scale (CRS). A variable returns to scale (VRS) can be explored \nby adding a convexity constraint such as N1\u2019\u03bb=1 to the envelopment problem. Such a \nconstraint allows us to construct the production frontier as a convex hull of intersecting \nplanes that envelops the data more closely than the conical CRS hull.  \n \nConstructing a production frontier based on the type of school-level production function \nspecified in equation (1) raises some special methodological challenges. Firstly, as a \npublic-sector application, frontier measurement of educational production is faced with \nthe common problems of ill-defined input prices, non-competitive markets, and imposed \nenvironmental conditions (Worthington 2001).  Secondly, the correspondence between \neducational inputs and outputs is difficult to identify. For example, it is difficult to \nunderstand how expenditures on schooling translate into outputs and how various inputs \n(e.g.: ability, family inputs, school inputs) interact over time (Hanushek 1979, Todd and \nWolpin 2003). As a result, the DEA application in our next section compares a number of \ninput-output specifications and uses the two-stage method to examine the determinants of \nefficiency scores. The two-stage method involves formulating a DEA model with \n\u201ctraditional\u201d inputs in the first stage and then regressing the resulting efficiency scores \nagainst school characteristics to assess the determinants of school efficiency.  \n \n 12\nData \n \nIn this study we use three different data sources to construct an overall database on \nprimary school performance in Queensland. Firstly, we use student administrative records \nfrom Education Queensland (the Queensland education department) to calculate school \noutput measures based on average test scores. Specifically, these output measures are the \naverage scaled numeracy and literacy scores for each school. This administrative data also \nprovides us with some demographic information on students such as their gender, \nwhether they are an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) or from a non-English \nSpeaking Background (NESB), and residential postcode. In some cases, these \ndemographic variables have been used to create variables on average school-level \ncharacteristics, most notably the proportion of ATSI students at a school.   \n \nSecondly, further demographic variables are created by linking the student administrative \nrecords to 2001 Census data on the socio-economic characteristics of postcode areas. \nSchool-level socio-economic indicators are therefore constructed by weighting the \nschool-level measure according to the residential distribution of students attending the \nschool. Finally, personnel data (based on Education Queensland\u2019s human resource \ninformation system) is used to calculate input variables describing the teaching labour \nforce at each school. This includes inputs related to teacher and teacher aide hours, school \nmanagers and average teacher experience. Full details on the calculation of these \nvariables are given in Appendix A.    \n \nThe scope of this database provides a unique opportunity to investigate school \nperformance in the public education system of a major Australian state. Table 3 reports \ninformation on the distribution of government and non-government school students \nacross the states. Queensland accounts for 20.4% of all Australian primary students in \ngovernment schools (versus 33.7% and 26.3% for NSW and Victoria respectively). Non-\ngovernment schooling is slightly less popular in Queensland with only 24.2% of primary \nstudents attending versus 28.2% (NSW) and 30.6% (Victoria).    An interesting feature of \nthe Queensland education system is its high proportion of ATSI students. In 2001 \n 13\nQueensland had 22,205 ATSI students enrolled at the primary level, approximately 28.1% \nof all of Australia\u2019s indigenous primary students. The state is therefore in line with \nWestern Australia and Tasmania with ATSI students representing around 6% of total \nprimary enrolments (see Table 4).     \n \nOur sample is based on a student cohort that is tracked from 1999 (Year 5) to 2001 (Year \n7). Education Queensland\u2019s student number system allows us to identify 27,000 \n\u201ccontinuing students\u201d, that is, students who stayed at the same school from Year 5 to \nYear 7.  We calculate school-level average test scores for this group of continuing \nstudents since their performance can be related to more closely to their school\u2019s \nperformance.     \n \nTable 5 provides some summary statistics for the 906 schools in our sample4. Queensland \nprimary schools have an average enrolment (school size) of 289 students across Years 1-\n7. Schools are split between those located in urban areas (45%), rural areas (37%) and \nremote areas (18%). However, the majority of students are located in urban areas (X%), \nindicating that rural and remote schools have  smaller average enrolment numbers. While \nthe average proportion of indigenous students per school is 9% the high standard \ndeviation also indicates that the distribution of indigenous students across schools is \nuneven.  Average teacher experience or tenure stands at approximately 10.8 years per \nindividual teacher and, on average, there are 1.84 managers (e.g.: principals, vice-\nprincipals) present at each school.  \n \nAverage school test scores by socio-economic category are reported in Table 5(a). Two \nmeasures of socio-economic structure \u2013 based on average income and the proportion of \nadults with degree\/diploma qualifications in the school's catchment area \u2013 are presented.  \nThere is a large gap between the top 25% of schools by socio-economic status and the \nrest. Test scores for schools in the top quartile are approximately 15-20 points higher than \nfor the next quartile. Surprisingly, in many cases average test scores for schools in the \nbottom quartile are higher than those for the middle two quartiles. This can be explained \n 14\nby the larger concentration of ATSI students in these middle quartiles. The average \nproportion of ATSI students for schools in the middle quartiles is approximately 11% \ncompared to 7%-9% for the other quartiles. Table 5(b) reports average test scores by \nquartile for schools a low proportion of ATSI students (less than 10%). This reveals a \nmore traditional pattern with average test scores declining as the proportion of adults with \ndegree and diploma qualifications falls. However, the inter-quartile variations between \nquartiles 2-4 are flat at best when socio-economic status is measured in terms of average \nincome.   \n \n4 RESULTS \n(i) Models and Efficiency Scores \nWe construct three models of school performance that utilise different combinations of \ninputs and outputs within a DEA framework. These models have been formulated to shed \nlight on different aspects of school performance and therefore different types of possible \nefficiency rankings or league tables. Our main objective is too examine how school \nperformance varies according to both socio-economic structure and the average prior \nability of students at a school. A literature stretching back to the Coleman et al (1966) \nreport has emphasised the role of socio-economic factors and prior ability in determining \neducational performance.  If either or both of these factors influence the measurement of \nschool performance then there will be implications for how quasi-market forces could be \nexpected to operate in Australia\u2019s public education system.  \n \nFirstly, we must clarify how our study defines \u201cschool performance\u201d. Principally, we are \nconcerned with school performance from a production economics perspective consistent \nwith the EPF outlined above. That is, schools are seen as firms or \u201cdecision-making \nunits\u201d (DMU\u2019s) responsible for using resource inputs to produce educational outputs. The \nvector of inputs includes labour and capital inputs, together with environmental inputs \nrelated to the characteristics of the student body. As discussed, school outputs are \ntypically defined in terms of academic test scores, although other non-academic outputs \ncan be included. Here we focus on outputs based on academic test scores since (i) such an \n 15\napproach allows us to make consistent comparisons with output measures based on \u201craw\u201d \naverage scores and (ii) data limitations prevent us from considering other potential \noutputs, such as absence rates, student satisfaction, or the quality of non-cognitive skills. \nTherefore our models define school performance in terms of the economic efficiency of \nschools. This contrasts for example with multi-faceted, qualitative discussions of school \nperformance in the educational statistics literature (Rowe 2000).    \n \nThe four models are described in Table 7. Each model uses Year 7 literacy and numeracy \nscores as outputs. Furthermore, note that each of these models reflect different \nrelationships in the school-level production function outlined in equation (1) above. \nModel 1 is simplest model, using only teacher labour force variables as part of its input \nvector. This model corresponds most closely with a simple or \u201craw\u201d model of school \nefficiency that ranks schools according to their average test score. Model 2 adds socio-\neconomic variables into the inputs vector as non-discretionary inputs. These include input \nvariables describing the income in the school's catchment area, diploma \/ degree \nqualifications in the catchment area, and the proportion of indigenous students attending \nthe school. These environmental variables were chosen to allow for variation across a \nnumber of socio-economic characteristics. For example, schools in some areas may \nbenefit from an environment where the catchment area population has high levels of \nhuman capital as well as high levels of income. Other schools may be exposed to a local \npopulation with high incomes but lower levels of human capital and so on. Finally, Model \n3 is formulated as a \u201cvalue-added\u201d model. That is, it includes prior ability as part of the \ninput vector in order to measure how efficient schools are at producing increases in \naverage test scores relative to their student\u2019s performance in Year 5. Model 3 also \nincorporates socio-economic variables as non-discretionary inputs. Therefore, among our \nthree models, Model 3 is the most complete representation of the school-level production \nfunction outlined in the previous section.            \n \nA summary of the efficiency scores produced by these different models is reported in \nTable 8. Model 1 is characterised by mean efficienc\n 16\nand VRS models respectively.  The minimum efficiency score of 5.0-5.4 also indicates \nthat this model has a wide range. Overall, this indicates that a large degree of technical \nefficiency exists among schools when a vector of labour-inputs is included as the only \ninput. The inclusion of socio-economic variables in Model 2 has a dramatic effect. Mean \nefficiency scores rise to 79.8 and 82.2 for the CRS and VRS models. The range is more \nlimited with a minimum score of 42.5 for both models. The addition of prior ability in \nModel 3 stimulates further improvements. The mean CRS and VRS efficiency scores rise \nto 93.8 and 95.1 respectively, with minimum scores of 77.3-77.4. Clearly then, the \ninclusion of environmental variables in Models 2 and 3 reduces the degree of technical \ninefficiency in school performance that is evident in Model 1. Furthermore, the small \ndifferences in mean CRS and VRS efficiency scores across the models suggests that scale \neconomies played a limited role in explaining the efficiency of the primary schools \nanalysed in this sample.     \n \nA comparison of the distribution of efficiency scores across the models is shown in \nFigure 2. There is both a large level and slope shift when moving from Model 1 to \nModels 2 and 3. Furthermore, there is a level shift of approximately 0.3 between Models \n2 and 3. Interestingly, the distribution of scores for Models 2 and 3 begin to converge as \nwe approach higher the efficiency scores. Therefore, the introduction of prior ability in \nthe first stage seems to have a greater effect on technical efficiency in the lower half of \nthe score distribution.   \n \nAs a check on the robustness of our results, Table 9 presents DEA estimates where the \nleast and most efficient schools are omitted from the analysis. This is performed 3 times \nrecursively for model 1 to model 3 respectively. The reported results suggest that our \nDEA estimates are robust to efficiency outliers.  \n \n(iii) Rank Correlations. \nThe Spearman rank correlations in Table 10 offer some further comparative information \non Models 1-3. Firstly, it is important to note the differences between comparisons of \n 17\nschool based on average test scores (ie: a \u201craw\u201d or unadjusted league table of schools) \nand rankings based on the application of DEA methods. The Spearman rank correlation \nresults in Table 10 indicate that the correlation between the raw and model-based \nrankings was low, ranging between approximately 0.26 and 0.38. In contrast, there is a \nstronger correlation between Models 1 to 3. Between all models, the rank correlation \ncoefficient ranged between 0.53 (Model 1 and Model 3) to 0.65 (Model 1 and Model 2).  \n \nInterpreting these rank correlations is difficult since we do not have an indicator of the \n\u201ctrue\u201d efficiency ranking of schools or indeed statistical distribution results. However, \ntwo conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, it is interesting to note that the rank correlations \nare stable across Models 1-3. This indicates that there may be some robustness in the \nresults, including systematic patterns of school performance. Secondly, to the extent that \nthe \u201craw\u201d league table rankings depart from our DEA-based measures we can say that the \nraw rankings convey limited information regarding the influence of socio-economic \nfactors and prior ability on school performance. As a result, it can be argued that the role \nof \u201craw\u201d league tables in providing signals of school efficiency or quality is at best \nlimited. \n \n(iv) Determinants of Efficiency \u2013 Second-Stage Tobit \n \nFinally, regression analysis is used to provide some evidence on the determinants of \nschool efficiency. We use the results from Model 1 as our measure of school efficiency as \nthis only includes those inputs which are directly in the control of the school \/ education \ndepartment. Furthermore, efficiency may be related to scale economies, we examine this \nby utilising the CRS results and including school enrolments to investigate the impact of \nschool size on efficiency. Socio-economic variables (income level), and variables \nidentifying schools with a high proportion of indigenous students, and the location of the \nschool (remote and rural) are also included. Finally, a fixed effects model is estimated to \naccount for local area effects (Model 2) while two variables are added to the basic model \nto examine the potential effects of inter-school competition (Model 3).   \n 18\n \nEfficiency scores are limited to the [0,1] interval, and some scores lie on the upper limit \nof one, as a result a Tobit model is used which allows for right censoring of the dependant \nvariable (Yi). This provides:  \n \niii xY \u03b5\u03b2 +\u2032=  if Yi<1;  \nYi  = 1 otherwise.   \n \nWhere Yi  is the efficiency score of the ith school. \n \nRegression estimates are provided in Table 11. School efficiency is positively related to \nschool size, indicating the presence of scale economies, although the negative sign on the \nquadratic term implies that this effect diminishes as school size increases. School \nefficiency is positively related to the income levels of student background, indicating that \nsocio-economic background can be categorized as an input into school production.  \nConversely, school efficiency decreases with the proportion of school students that are \nindigenous, this is indicative of the difficulties involved with indigenous education in \nAustralia. At the same time, schools in remote locations also suffer a 4 point penalty to \nmeasured technical efficiency. These last two results are of particular interest as many \nschools with high proportions of indigenous students are located in remote areas of \nQueensland. This means that, other things being equal, these schools will tend to perform \npoorly in either \u201craw\u201d league table or simple school input-based models of technical \nefficiency. This is a concern as clearly neither indigenous composition of students or \nregional location of school is in the control of school decision makers.  \n \nThe fixed effects term in Model 2 is defined at the local government area (LGA) level and \ntherefore accounts for region-specific variations in school efficiency. Such region-specific \neffects are important insofar that they could be collinear with variables such as average \nincome, rural school and remote school. Here, the inclusion of the fixed effects term \n 19\nimproves the precision of the estimates for average income, rural school and remote \nschool, while the magnitude of the co-efficients is similar to the basic model. \n \nModel 3 uses two variables to test for the potential effects of inter-school competition. \nThe number of government schools per LGA is used to represent the potential \ncompetition a school faces from other government schools in the local area. That is, \nwhere catchment areas overlap there is potential for schools to compete in terms of \nreputation and perceived performance. However, these effects are likely to be weak in the \nabsence of clear signalling mechanisms, such as league tables. Despite this the variable \nrepresenting competition among government schools is significant at the 5% level. \nFurthermore, the co-efficient estimate indicates that the hypothetical introduction of a \nnew school in an LGA raises the efficiency of affected schools by 0.16 of a percentage \npoint. The other variable tested is one representing competition from non-government \nschools within an LGA. Competition from non-government schools has the potential to \nexert two opposite effects. It can either increase efficiency by encouraging government \nschools to maintain and improve their performance or it can reduce efficiency by \nattracting the best students (usually from higher socio-economic backgrounds) in a \nprocess of \u201ccream-skimming\u201d. Empirically, we find weak evidence of a negative effect  \nfrom non-government school competition \u2013 approximately 0.17 of percentage point for \neach additional non-government school in an LGA at the 10% significance level.     \n \nIt must be noted that this can only be interpreted as preliminary evidence of competitive \neffects. Further data and more complex variables are needed to establish the effects with \nmore certainty. Sentences on other studies of competition and school reform.   \n \n5 CONCLUSION \n \nRecent reforms to Australia\u2019s primary and secondary education system have resulted in an \nincreased emphasis on performance measurement and an increased role for market \nmechanisms. In this context, it is useful to look to the UK\u2019s experience of quasi-markets \n 20\nto ask questions about possible policy directions for Australia. We have used this \nbackground to motivate two questions. Firstly, how well do unadjusted school league \ntables perform as signals of school performance, given the important role of socio-\neconomic status and student intake quality? Secondly, to what extent are market forces \u2013 \nparticularly those related to school competition - already operating in Australia\u2019s \nregulated education system? Answers to these questions are critical to evaluating the \npotential success of quasi-market reforms in Australia.         \n \nOur analysis of a large database of Queensland primary schools provides some insights \ninto these issues. On the first question, there are striking differences in the school \nperformance rankings that are suggested by a \u201craw\u201d league table that uses average test \nscores and the rankings produced by model-based methods that account for socio-\neconomic factors and intake quality. The raw league table rankings are consistent with \nmodel-based rankings in only 22%-38% of cases, depending on model structure. Given \nthat we do not know the \u201ctrue\u201d distribution of school efficiency or quality it is difficult to \nevaluate how accurate the raw and model-based rankings are in practice. However, the \nlimited correlations between the raw rankings and model-based rankings suggest that the \nformer measures do not adequately reflect the influence of socio-economic factors and \nintake quality. In practice then, raw league tables understate the performance of schools in \ndisadvantaged socio-economic areas.  \n \nBriefly, this means that an Australian quasi-market model centred on an unadjusted \nleague table would face important signalling and incentive problems. The main problem \nwith using unadjusted test scores as signals of school performance is that it increases the \nscope for schools to \u201cgame the system\u201d. That is, using unadjusted league tables as the \nprincipal performance indicator in a quasi-market model opens up a route for schools to \nimprove their (perceived) performance by optimising the structure of their student body, \neither in terms of socio-economic composition or prior academic ability. Furthermore, as \nthis performance indicator is adopted by parents as a determinant of school choice it \nexerts a pressure for increased social segregation between schools, as found in the UK \n 21\nsystem by Bradley and Taylor (2002). In turn, these problems could be expected to affect \nthe nature of the equity-efficiency trade off that would result if market-oriented reforms \nwere implemented in Australia. The trade-off would be effected in two ways. Firstly, as \nstudent composition becomes more polarised, social segregation would obviously reduce \nthe equity of outcomes between schools. Secondly, to the extent that improvements in \nperformance (as measured by raw average test scores) are secured through \u201cgaming\u201d by \nschools then this would artificially inflate the magnitude of the system-wide efficiency \ngains.   \n \nIn terms of our second question, the results of the second stage Tobit regression indicate \nthat school efficiency in our sample is affected by inter-school competition, albeit weakly. \nSpecifically, our results suggest that increased competition between government schools \nhas the potential to increase school efficiency. On the other hand, the results also suggest \nthat the interaction between government and non-government schools must be managed \ncarefully to avoid \u201ccream skimming\u201d and other negative effects associated with \ncompetition between the two systems. Of course, our results are subject to the caveat that \nthese competitive effects need to be established with more certainty using further data and \nmore complex models of competition. However, it must be noted that the UK evidence \nindicates that inter-school competition was a driving force of efficiency gains (Bradley et \nal 2002). The findings presented above therefore raise the prospect that competition could \nhave similar benefits for the efficiency of the Australian system, if managed correctly.    \n \nThis last caveat is of special importance. Australian policy-makers do have an \nopportunity to design and manage a more effective framework for primary and secondary \nschooling. The UK experience has produced research and data that is able to inform the \nAustralian situation. In addition, as Leigh and Wolfers (2003) argue, compared to \nprevious eras Australian policy-makers now have the opportunity to engage in more \ndetailed \u201cevidence-based\u201d policy development.  This can be described as  \u201cthe notion that \npolicy ideas should stand or fall on the basis of research and trials, rather than opinion \npolling and supposition\u201d. In conclusion, we suggest that further use of the type of \n 22\nadministrative data used in this study has the potential to fuel this process of evidence-\nbased policy development.      \nREFERENCES \nAbbot (2000) \u201cSocial Business, Social Markets, Social Capital\u201d.

Glennerster (1991:1268) points out that the British model falls short of a full market solution \nbecause (a) funding cannot follow students into the private sector and (b) the entry of new providers is \nrestricted.   \n4\n A number of schools (160) were omitted from the analysis due to missing observations or very low \nenrolment numbers (5 students or less).  \n 26\nTable 1: Educational Reforms and Quasi-Market Forces \n \n Preconditions for Quasi-Markets \n \nEducational Reform \nDecentralised \nDecision-\nMaking \nIncentives Information Choice Voice \nFormula Funding \u221a \u221a - - - \nLocal Management of \nSchools \n\u221a \n- - - - \nOpen Enrolment - - - \u221a - \nOpting-Out \u221a - - \u221a - \nTechnology Colleges - - - \u221a - \nSchool-site governance \u221a - - - - \nSchool Performance Tables - \u221a \u221a - \u221a \n      \nSource: Bradley et al (2000:359). \n 27\n \nTable 2: School Performance Information in Australia (Year 12), 2002. \nState \/ Territory Information \nNew South Wales Publishes names and schools of students with achieving more than 90% \nin each subject. \nVictoria School-by-School information on: \n- Median study scores in the Victorian Certificate of Education \n- Rates of satisfactory completion. \n- Post-Year 12 \u201cTransition Profile\u201d of student employment and \neducation destinations. \nQueensland Assessment is school-based with no information made public. \nSouth Australia A list of students who achieve a perfect Year 12 score is published, \nthough no comparative data is made available. \nWestern Australia Year 12 results are made available to newspapers for a fee and are \nsubsequently published. \nTasmania Names and schools of the students achieving in the top 0.5% are \npublished. \nACT Publishes the average University Admissions Index for each school.  \nNorthern Territory Names, schools and scores of the top 20 students are published each \nyear. \nSources: Yaman and Nason (2002); Kosky (2002). \n \n \n \n \n \n 28\n \nTable 3: Government and Non-Government Schooling by State , 2001.  \n \n \n(1) \nProportion in \nGovernment \nSchools \n(%) \n(2) \nProportion in \nNon-Government \nSchools \n(3) \nShare \u2013  All \nGovernment \nSchool Students, \nAustralia (%) \n \n(4) \nShare \u2013  All Non-\nGovernment \nSchool Students, \nAustralia (%) \n \nNew South Wales 71.8 28.2 32.7 33.7 \nVictoria 69.4 30.6 22.7 26.3 \nQueensland 75.8 24.2 20.4 17.1 \nSouth Australia 71.7 28.3 8.3  8.6 \nWestern Australia 74.4 25.6 10.3 9.3 \nTasmania 77.7 22.3 2.6 2.0 \nNorthern Territory 80.2 19.8 1.5 1.0 \nAustralian Capital \nTerritory \n66.0 34.0 1.5 2.1 \nAustralia 72.4 27.6 100 1.000 \nSource: ABS (2002) Schools, Australia  (Cat: 4221.0). \n(1) Proportion of all primary students attending government schools. \n(2) Proportion of all primary students attending non-government schools. \n(3) Given state or territory\u2019s share of all government primary school students in Australia. \n(4) Given state or territory\u2019s share of all non-government primary school students in Australia. \n 29\n \nTable 4: Indigenous Students by State, 2001. \n \n (1) \nIndigenous \nStudents \u2013  \nTotal  \n(2) \nAll Students \u2013 \nTotal  \n(3) \nProportion \nIndigenous \nStudents (%) \n(4) \nShare - Australian \nIndigenous Students \n(%) \nNew South Wales 22,208 630,261 3.5 28.1 \nVictoria 4,101 453,766 0.9 5.2 \nQueensland 22,205 372,316 6.0 28.1 \nSouth Australia 5,002 159,400 3.1 6.3 \nWestern Australia 12,211 191,633 6.4 15.5 \nTasmania 2,806 46,872 6.0 3.6 \nNorthern Territory 9,780 25,675 38.1 12.4 \nACT  630 32,490 1.9 0.8 \nAustralia 78,943 1,912,413 4.1 100.0 \nSource: ABS (2002) Schools, Australia  (Cat: 4221.0). \n(1) Total number of primary indigenous students. \n(2) Total number of primary indigenous and non-indigenous students. \n(3) Proportion of primary indigenous students. \n(5) Given state or territory\u2019s share of all primary indigenous students in Australia. \n \n \n \n \n \n 30\n Table 5: School Characteristics, 2001. \n Mean Std Dev \nSchool Enrolment 288.73 250.35 \nUrban School 0.45 0.50 \nRemote School 0.18 0.38 \nRural School 0.37 0.48 \nSchool Prop.
