Empirical \nequations developed to describe the particle size distribution within aggregates are used to \nderive relative aggregation coefficients for the electrostatic aggregation process. Our results \ncan be used within numerical models of volcanic plumes in order to improve their \nrepresentation of electrostatic aggregation processes. \n \n1. Introduction \nThe aggregation of small silicate particles (<100 \u00b5m in diameter) within volcanic \nplumes is a process that is known to occur, but which is currently poorly understood. Some \naggregates (accretionary lapilli), which form in humid plumes, can develop significant \nmechanical strength due to cementation by minerals precipitating from evaporating liquid \nlayers [Gilbert and Lane, 1994; Sparks et al., 1997]. This greatly enhances their preservation \npotential, allowing them to be observed within deposits. Hence, the internal composition, \nshape and density of accretionary lapilli can be studied with relative ease [Schumacher and \nSchmincke, 1991]. \nIn contrast, \u2018dry\u2019 aggregates, which are bound mainly by electrostatic forces, are \nextremely delicate. Once on the ground, moisture, in combination with contact with Earth \nallows charges to be neutralised. Thus, intimate contact with other particles and aggregates \ndetermine that original aggregate structures usually have a maximum lifetime of hours to \ndays. Therefore, although they may be much more common than accretionary lapilli, the only \nevidence for \u2018dry\u2019 aggregate deposition is generally their collective influence on the deposit \n 3\nthickness and grainsize distribution. Some dry aggregates have been collected as they \nfell from eruption plumes [Sorem, 1982; Sparks et al., 1997] but their individual component \nparticle size distributions have not previously been analysed. For several documented \neruptions, this type of loosely bound, dry aggregate has been interpreted as being responsible \nfor the secondary thickening of ash fall deposits and their bimodal grain size distributions \n[Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; Brazier et al., 1983; Cornell et al., 1983; Wiesner et al., 1995]. \nSignificant differences between deposit parameters and the results of numerical models \nwhich exclude aggregation (notably the early deposition of particles sufficiently small that \nthey would be expected to be transported far from the volcano) indicate that sedimentation of \ndry, electrostatic aggregates can be extremely important [Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; \nCornell et al., 1983]. This importance is emphasised by the fact that the silicate particles \nwhich are the most affected by the aggregation process (generally those <100 \u00b5m in size), \nrepresent >70 wt% of some deposits [Cornell et al., 1983]. \nThe implications of poor understanding of the aggregation process and the nature of \naggregates therefore range from the miscalculation of eruption parameters from ashfall \ndeposits to significant errors in predicted ash hazards for future eruptions. Previously, \nestimates of aggregate sizes and densities have been obtained by adjusting the parameters of \nnumerical plume models in order for the results to fit the parameters of known deposits \n[Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; Brazier et al., 1983; Cornell et al., 1983; Wiesner et al., 1995]. \nThis approach has indicated aggregate densities between 1200 and 200 kg m-3 and \u2018average\u2019 \naggregate sizes of 200 to ~500 \u00b5m. The results of laboratory fall-velocity experiments [James \net al., 2002] have supported these values and further suggested that smaller aggregates (<200 \n\u00b5m) had higher densities (up to ~600 kg m-3) than larger ones (>200 \u00b5m, 100 to 200 kg m-3). \nHowever, in order to calculate these values, aggregate drag coefficients had to be assumed to \nbe those of falling spheres [James et al., 2002], dictating that the density values obtained \nwere \u2018equivalent\u2019 densities, representing a combination of the real aggregate density and any \nshape or structure factors which may also affect fall velocity.  \nThe bulk size distribution of particles incorporated into aggregates has also been \npreviously estimated from deposits, where the fine mode of bimodal particle size \ndistributions is interpreted to represent the small, aggregated particles which fell \nsimultaneously with larger, individual particles [Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; Cornell et al., \n1983; Brazier et al., 1983]. Associated numerical models have aggregated all particles <63 \n\u00b5m [Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982], or 25 % of particles 22 to 31 \u00b5m, 75 % of particles 16 to \n22 \u00b5m and all particles <16 \u00b5m [Cornell et al., 1983] or particles between 15 and 125 \u00b5m \n[Wiesner et al., 1995] in order to best fit the observations. Bimodal deposits have also been \nobserved within laboratory experiments [James et al., 2002], but the interpretation that these \n 4\nare formed by simultaneous deposition of aggregates and particles has not been \nindependently verified by direct assessment of the component particle size distributions of \nindividual aggregates.  \nIn this paper, we build on recent experimental work concerning the physical \ncharacteristics of electrostatic aggregates [James et al., 2002] by further constraining the \ndensity of laboratory generated dry aggregates and determining their component particle size \ndistributions. Using these data we develop empirical relations which allow the total mass and \ncomponent particle size distribution for an aggregate of given size to be determined. \nCombining these with an aggregate size distribution allows relative aggregation coefficients \nto be calculated. Finally, with the value for aggregate density measured in this work, the \naggregate fall velocity results of James et al. [2002] are used in order to obtain aggregate \ndrag coefficients. The results will be of use for incorporating electrostatic aggregation \nprocesses into plume models as has recently been carried out for accretionary lapilli [Veitch \nand Woods, 2001]. \nIn keeping with the approach of James et al. [2002], throughout this paper we use the \nequations for spheres to relate aggregate sizes, masses and densities. Aggregate size is given \nby the \u2018equivalent aggregate diameter\u2019, da, which is the diameter of a circle equivalent in area \nto a 1:1 image of the aggregate. Consequently, aggregate mass is given by \u03c0da3\u03c1\/6, where \u03c1 is \nthe aggregate density. Due to its simplicity, this equivalent sphere representation is useful for \nmodelling the properties of electrostatic aggregates, however it should not be taken to imply \nreal, physical densities or porosities because aggregate shapes have been shown to be highly \nirregular [James et al., 2002]. \n \n2. Aggregate density and component particle size distributions \nIn order to measure the density and component particle size distributions of individual \naggregates, laboratory experiments were carried out to produce aggregates from particles \ngenerated by fracturing pumice. Individually collected aggregates were either weighed (in \norder to calculate their density) or their component particles were dispersed for particle size \nanalysis. For all the experiments described here, the pumice used was from the May 18, 1980 \nMount St. Helens fall deposit. \n \n2.1 Experimental method \nAggregates were produced with the apparatus described in James et al. [2002], which \nconsists of a particle production unit located at the top of a draught-proof chamber. Particles \n 5\nwere generated by repeatedly colliding two centimetre-sized pumice samples together \nwith a solenoid at 2 Hz, producing ~0.2 mg of particles per impact. The particles became \nelectrostatically charged during this pumice fracture process [James et al., 1998; James, \n1999; James et al., 2000] as a result of fracto-emission [Donaldson et al., 1988] and this \ndrove the aggregation as they fell (~1.5 m) within the chamber. Thus, charge was not \nartificially introduced and was generated by the process believed responsible for the \nelectrification of volcanic plumes [James et al., 2000]. Although the size of the largest \nparticles produced (~1 mm) was probably limited by relatively low impact energies (impact \nvelocities were ~0.7 m s-1), the brittle fracture mechanism is thought to be representative of \nthe dominant particle generation mechanism within explosive eruptions and produced \nparticles similar in size and shape to those observed in fine grained deposits [James, 1999; \nJames et al., 2002].  \nIn order to collect aggregates for mass measurements and density calculations, pre-\nweighed, glass coverslips were placed on glass collection strips at the base of the apparatus. \nParticles and aggregates landing on the coverslips were gently removed with a fine brush, to \nleave only one aggregate on each coverslip. Each aggregate was digitally imaged through an \noptical microscope for size analysis before the coverslips were reweighed. A Cahn \nElectrobalance with a resolution of \u00b11 \u00b5g up to a maximum mass of 250 mg (each coverslip \nwas ~110 mg) was used for the weighing. Despite the microgram resolution, repeatability \nproblems (which were probably the result of electrostatic charge) indicated a more limited \naccuracy for the mass measurements and suggested that a cautious error of \u00b110 \u00b5g should be \nused. Due to the low density (and therefore small mass) of the aggregates investigated, this \nerror prevented any useful analysis of aggregates less than ~400 \u00b5m in diameter. \nIn order to carry out component particle size analysis of individual aggregates, another \nexperiment was carried out without coverslips on the glass collection strips. After all of the \nparticulate material had settled, each collection strip was individually extracted and the \nmajority of the deposit on it removed, to leave approximately 10 aggregates untouched. The \narea around each was then cleaned further under magnification to ensure that no individual \nparticles remained and digital images were taken of the aggregates. \nEach aggregate was then dispersed by putting a drop of filtered, deionised water onto it \nwith a syringe and allowing it to evaporate. For the smallest aggregates investigated (~50 \n\u00b5m), this was a delicate procedure but, when carried out successfully, produced well \ndispersed particles. For larger aggregates, the procedure was relatively simple but did not \nalways reliably disperse the particles sufficiently for analysis. Attempts to increase the \ndispersion by using dilute solutions (to remove electrostatic attraction between the particles) \nand soaps (to reduce surface tension effects) proved fruitless due to residues left by the \n 6\nevaporating liquids which obscured particles. For the largest aggregates investigated \n(~850 to 1100 \u00b5m), where a satisfactory dispersion of the finest particles was not achieved, \nthe analysis was therefore limited to measuring the largest particle incorporated into each \naggregate. Under the microscope, due to their morphology and three dimensional form, these \nlarge particles were easily distinguished from non-dispersed clumps of smaller ones. \nAfter the water had evaporated, the area covered by each dispersed aggregate was \nthen digitally imaged through a microscope. Larger aggregates required >300 images in order \nto cover the entire dispersal area, and the smallest aggregates required ~30. The image \nprocessing and analysis used for these images was the same as employed on the images of \nwhole aggregates. Images were first thresholded then binarised in Micrografx Picture \nPublisher before being analysed for particle size using Scion Image. The data obtained \nrepresent the area (in pixels) covered by each particle or aggregate. These values were \nconverted into real areas (\u00b5m2) and then represented by the diameter of an equivalent area \ncircle (the \u2018equivalent diameter\u2019) for interpretation and presentation. \nThe digital imaging was carried out with a Pixera camera mounted on a transmitted \nlight microscope and, when imaging the entire area of a dispersed aggregate with multiple \nimages, a linear stage was used to ensure and facilitate complete spatial coverage. Optical \nresolution was not an issue when imaging complete aggregates but limited the size of the \nsmallest particle which could be detected within the dispersions. From theory, the size of the \nsmallest features which can be resolved by a light microscope (assuming that their separation \nis equal to or greater than their size) is given as half the distance of the Rayleigh criterion, \u2206x \n[Vollrath, 1999], where \n \nNA\nx \u03bb61.0=\u2206  1), \n\u03bb is the wavelength used and NA is the numerical aperture of the objective lens. For most of \nthe particle sizing, an objective with NA = 0.12 was used and, taking \u03bb to be 0.55 \u00b5m, this \ngives a Rayleigh resolution of 1.4 \u00b5m. With this microscope configuration, the digital image \npixel size was ~0.73 \u00d7 0.73 \u00b5m. Dispersed particles from the two smallest aggregates were \nimaged using an objective with NA = 0.24, giving a Rayleigh resolution of 0.7 \u00b5m and, with \nthis lens, the pixel size was ~0.30 \u00d7 0.30 \u00b5m. Thus, for both lenses used, the digital images \nwere capable of producing data representing sizes smaller than could have been effectively \nresolved by the Rayleigh-limited optics. Data in this category were a result of noise during \nthe digitisation, errors in the thresholding or possibly diffraction effects. Therefore, during \nanalysis, sub-resolution sized \u2018particles\u2019 were excluded from the particle size distributions, \nbut their count has been used to give an estimate of the maximum error in the total particle \ncounts. \n 7\n \n2.2 Results \nThe densities of 32 aggregates, as calculated from their measured masses and assuming \nan equivalent spherical shape, are shown in Figure 1a. Despite the relative magnitude of the \nerrors, the data clearly suggest aggregate densities of  <300 kg m-3. Several different trends \ncan be interpreted in the data and, if the entire data set is considered as one, then a gradually \ndecreasing density with increasing diameter would be appropriate. However, images of the \nlanded aggregates suggest that the larger aggregates may have spread out somewhat during \nimpact (Figure 2), effectively increasing their measured diameter and thus decreasing their \ncalculated densities. This is illustrated by landed aggregates larger than ~700 \u00b5m typically \ndemonstrating little internal structure, relatively circular shapes and being surrounded by \nhalos of broken off particles (e.g. the uppermost image in Figure 2). Smaller aggregates \ngenerally appear more coherent, with highly irregular shapes, observable internal structures \nand few, if any, separated particles. Therefore, for examining the density data, aggregates \nsmaller or larger than ~700 \u00b5m could be considered separately and, in this case, a constant \ndensity may be applicable to each group, with averages of ~200 \u00b1 25 kg m-3 for small \naggregates and ~83 \u00b1 5 kg m-3 for larger aggregates. If this density difference is entirely due \nto the artefact of larger aggregates spreading out during landing, it would imply that their \nequivalent diameters have been overestimated by up to ~35 %. This is believed to be an \nentirely plausible value, implying that the measured decrease in aggregate densities with \nincreasing diameter could be a result only of the overestimation of diameters. \nIn order to help further constrain aggregate densities, values have also been estimated \nfrom the particle size analyses. Thirteen of the aggregates collected for particle size analysis \nwere successfully dispersed and, given the known size of each particle within an aggregate, \nthe total solid mass can be calculated if an average particle shape and density (2200 kg m-3) \nare assumed. Combining this with the measured size of the aggregate (calculated from its \nequivalent diameter and assuming a spherical shape) allows an estimate of the aggregate \ndensity to be made. Figure 1b gives the results of these calculations carried out assuming \neither a spherical shape or a flat disk (of estimated thickness) for the individual component \nparticles. Considering that most of the component particles are shards of bubble walls \n[James, 1999], the spherical particle model is expected to overestimate the density \nconsiderably, and the results are shown in Figure 1b for reference. The disk particle model is \nthought most likely to closely represent the real situation, particularly for the smaller \naggregates (<700 \u00b5m) and has been shown to represent particle surface areas in deposits \n 8\nconsiderably better than spheres [C. M. Riley et al., Quantitative shape measurements \nof distal volcanic ash, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research, 2001]. \nThe disk model produces density values which demonstrate an independence from \naggregate size, however, their average value is sensitive to the particle thickness chosen. \nSEM images of particles produced by the apparatus [James, 1999] suggest that a disk \nthickness <10 \u00b5m would be appropriate. Using a value of 5 \u00b5m gives 200 kg m-3 (Figure 1b), \nbut thicknesses of 4 or 6 \u00b5m give 160 and 240 kg m-3 respectively. Therefore we use these \ndata only to determine the independence of aggregate density from aggregate size (for \naggregates smaller than ~750 \u00b5m), and assign a density value (200 kg m-3) on the basis of the \nmass measurements (Figure 1a) of aggregates believed to be unaffected by spreading during \nlanding (those <700 \u00b5m in diameter). Thus, in the rest of the paper, a constant aggregate \ndensity of 200 kg m-3 is used. \nThe component particle size data from individual aggregates allowed the total number \nof constituent particles larger than 1.4 \u00b5m in each aggregate to be counted and the results are \ngiven in Figure 3a, plotted against the equivalent aggregate diameter. For simplicity, the data \nhave been fitted with two power laws although a more complex curve would be more likely \nto reflect the underlying growth mechanism. For aggregates larger than ~150 \u00b5m, the number \nof component particles increase with a near cubic relation as would be expected if the \ncomponent particle size distribution and aggregate density remained constant. However, at \ndiameters less than ~150 \u00b5m a different slope may be appropriate (giving da 1.6). Although \nonly two data points fall away from the trend for larger aggregates these points represent the \nresults of 171 and 389 individual particle counts and we therefore have confidence in their \nvalues. Given that aggregate densities appear to be approximately constant (Figure 1b), the \nslope of 1.6 (Figure 3a) must represent a significant change in the particle size distribution \nwithin these aggregates, with larger aggregates containing some increasingly larger \ncomponent particles.  \n This is supported by Figure 3b, which gives the component particle size distributions \nfor the analysed aggregates. The data are presented as cumulative distributions where, at any \ndiameter, the value represents the number of particles of that size or larger and, on the log-\nlinear axes, many of the distributions give straight lines or shallow curves.  The steeper \nslopes for the smaller aggregates indicate distributions more dominated by smaller particles \nthan those of the larger (>150 \u00b5m) aggregates. By volume, the distributions\u2019 maxima (of all \nthe aggregates) occur over a range of diameters from ~7 to 33 \u00b5m (if component particles are \nrepresented as spheres) or from ~5 to 17 \u00b5m (if component particles are represented as disks). \nIn Figure 3b only particle size data <70 \u00b5m have been plotted in order to demonstrate \nthe major trends. However, most of the aggregates also contain small proportions of \n 9\nconsiderably larger particles. These coarser particles comprise only a small fraction \n(generally <2 %) of the total volume, and the largest particle observed within individual \naggregates are shown in Figure 3c. The data suggest that aggregates smaller than ~200 \u00b5m \nhave a maximum particle size which is a relatively strong function of the aggregate size. The \nmajority of larger aggregates appear to have maximum particle sizes between 50 and 150 \u00b5m \nand demonstrate a much lower correlation to aggregate diameter. \n \n2.3 Aggregation model \nIn order to estimate the total particle size distribution within a collection of \naggregates, empirical relations to describe the size distribution of component particles of \nindividual aggregates (i.e. Figure 3b) have been derived (Figure 4). The presence of relatively \nstraight lines and straight line segments in Figure 3b suggests that exponential-type \ndistributions are suitable. Therefore, we represent the cumulative component particle size \ndistribution within any aggregate of given size (\u2265140 \u00b5m in equivalent diameter) by the sum \nof two exponential distributions multiplied by a scaling factor to reflect the total number of \ncomponent particles; \n( ) ( )[ ]ppa dddn 0.083-exp008.022.0exp000272.0 3 +\u2212=  da\u2265140 \u00b5m 2), \nwhere n is the number of component particles larger than a diameter dp within an aggregate \nof equivalent diameter da (Figure 3b). The coefficients were determined by comparing model \nresults to the measured aggregate densities (using the 2200 kg m-3, 5 \u00b5m-thick disk \ncomponent particle model), particle size distributions and total particle numbers given in the \nprevious section. Note that our data constrain this relation only for aggregates smaller than \n~850 \u00b5m and, as shown in Figure 4c, the model fits the data from some aggregates better than \nit does for others. In Figure 4d, Equation 2 is shown to produce a reasonable value for the \nmaximum component particle diameter (by setting n=1) within aggregates. \n However, Equation 2 was found to fit the data for aggregates smaller than 140 \u00b5m \npoorly (and produced invalid results such as component particles larger than the host \naggregate). Thus, for simplicity, a second relation is given for aggregates smaller than 140 \n\u00b5m (Figure 4c); \n( )797.03.1 9.10exp2.1 \u2212\u2212= apa dddn  da<140 \u00b5m 3). \nIn this case, the limited data are fitted best by a component particle size distribution which \nvaries with the size of the aggregate, hence da is included within the exponential function in \nEquation 3. The density values calculated by Equation 3 increase slightly with decreasing \naggregate diameter (Figure 4a), however, given the magnitude of scatter within experimental \n 10\ndata, this is not deemed to be significant. Note that the power of da in Equations 2 \nand 3 (3 and 1.3 respectively) defines the slope of the total number of component particles \nresults (Figure 4b) and are close to the values obtained from the best line fits to the data (3.2 \nand 1.6 in Figure 3a). \n3. Aggregation coefficients \nThe aggregation coefficient [Gilbert and Lane, 1994] of a particle of a certain size \nrepresents its probability of being incorporated into an aggregate and is thus a product of both \nparticle collision and sticking coefficients. From experiments carried out in a recirculating \nwind tunnel, Gilbert and Lane [1994] calculated relative aggregation coefficients for particles \nincorporated into accretionary lapilli. Although it is not possible to calculate coefficients \ndirectly from our experiments (due to aggregates never being completely separable from \nindividual particles), an estimate can be made by combining the model results for component \nparticle sizes (Equations 2 and 3) with an aggregate size distribution. This provides the \nestimated total size distribution of all aggregated particles, which can then be compared with \nparticle size data for a deposit as a whole (containing particles which fell incorporated into \naggregates and those that fell individually). \nFrom experimental data on particles aggregating during ~1 m of fall, James et al. \n[2002] gives the cumulative aggregate size distribution produced as \n ada en\n01.0\u2212\n\u221d  4),  \nwhere na is the number of aggregates larger than a diameter da (in microns). Using this to \ndetermine the relative number of aggregates of any particular diameter, the total component \nparticle size distribution of all aggregated particles (Figure 5a) can be obtained from \nEquations 2 and 3. \nAlso shown in Figure 5a are two cumulative particle size distributions obtained (by an \nElzone particle sizer) from deposits produced within our apparatus, which have been scaled \nto coincide with the model results at a particle diameter of 10 \u00b5m (i.e. so that all data sets \nhave the same number of particles larger than 10 \u00b5m). The Elzone data acquired using a 300 \n\u00b5m orifice tube (which allowed particles down to 10 \u00b5m to be analysed) suggest that particles \n>10 \u00b5m have a decreasing probability of being incorporated into aggregates with increasing \nsize. In order to analyse smaller particles, a 120 \u00b5m orifice tube was used and the \ncoincidence of these data with the model results suggest that particles between ~4 and 10 \u00b5m \nin size have an approximately constant likelihood of being incorporated into aggregates. The \nuse of the 120 \u00b5m tube required that the sample was sieved at 70 \u00b5m and this, combined with \ninherent difficulties in merging data sets taken with different orifice tubes, is the reason for \nthe variation between the overlapping section of the Elzone data sets. \n 11\nFor particle sizes >10 \u00b5m, ratioing the 300 \u00b5m orifice tube Elzone data with \nthe model gives an aggregation coefficient which, due to the scaling described above, is \ndefined as being relative to a coefficient of 1 at 10 \u00b5m. This relative aggregation coefficient \nis plotted in Figure 5b along with the equivalent coefficient determined by Gilbert and Lane \n[1994] for accretionary lapilli. For particle sizes between 4 and 10 \u00b5m, the coincidence of the \nElzone data with the model results (Figure 5a) implies that these particle sizes also have an \naggregation coefficient of 1. Figure 5b demonstrates that while dry aggregation may be \nslightly more efficient at accumulating smaller particles, accretionary lapilli scavenge much \nlarger ones.  \n \n4. Drag coefficients \nThe drag coefficient, Cd, of a body moving at a velocity, v, in a fluid is defined by \n \nAv\nFC\nf\nd\nd 2\n2\n1 \u03c1\n=   5), \nwhere Fd is the drag force, \u03c1f is the density of the fluid (1.23 kg m-3 for sea-level atmosphere) \nand A is the projected area of the body onto a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion \n[Batchelor, 1967]. For an object falling at its terminal velocity, then Fd = mg, where m is its \nmass and g is the acceleration due to gravity, giving \n \nAv\nmgC\nf\nd 2\n2\n1 \u03c1\n=   6). \nTherefore, if an aggregate is represented as a sphere of measured size and fall velocity, and \nthe density value given in section 2.2 (200 kg m-3) is used to calculate its mass, then its drag \ncoefficient can be determined from Equation 6. \nHere we examine the data of James et al. [2002] who produced aggregates using the \napparatus described in this paper and measured fall velocities directly by imaging strobe-\nilluminated aggregates [James et al., 2002, Figure 5] as they fell. Aggregate sizes were \ndetermined as the diameter of a circle of equivalent area to the illuminated side view of each \naggregate and aggregate drag coefficients have been calculated as described above by \nrepresenting the aggregates as spheres with a density of 200 kg m-3. The results are given by \nthe open symbols in Figure 6a, plotted against the aggregates\u2019 Reynolds number, Re = \nv\u03c1fda\/\u00b5, where \u00b5 is the fluid viscosity (1.7\u00d710-5 Pa s for sea-level atmosphere). The large \ndegree of scatter in the data is probably mainly due to the simple spherical representation of \nthe irregular aggregate shapes. \nIn a second type of experiment, James et al. [2002] horizontally separated falling \nparticles and aggregates within a slow crosswind as a function of their fall velocities. The \n 12\nmaterial landed on glass collection strips (oriented orthogonal to the crosswind \ndirection) and the fall velocity of aggregates on any one strip was assumed to approximate to \nthat of individual particles which had landed on the same strip. This effectively allowed fall \nvelocities to be ascribed to collections of aggregates, therefore decreasing scatter in the data. \nAggregate and coincident individual particle sizes were determined by optical methods \nsimilar to those described here (section 2.1) and representative diameters were obtained for \n25 different aggregate distributions. The aggregate diameters were then assigned fall \nvelocities equal to those calculated for the coincident single particles and here, we have \nderived aggregate drag coefficients using these velocities. However, this dictates that our \naggregate drag coefficient values depend on the velocity model used to calculate the fall \nvelocity of the individual particles. \nIn Figure 6a, the solid black symbols represent the calculated aggregate drag \ncoefficients where velocity equivalence was assumed with individual falling particles whose \nfall velocities were determined from the standard drag curve for spheres [Clift et al., 1978]. \nThe power law best fit line for these results (solid black line) can be seen to be nearly \ncoincident with that from the individual aggregates (dashed black line). However, it has been \nshown that representing volcanic particles as spheres can significantly overestimate their fall \nvelocity, particularly for shard-like particles [C. M. Riley et al., Quantitative shape \nmeasurements of distal volcanic ash, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research, \n2001; Wilson and Huang, 1979]. Therefore, aggregate drag coefficients have also been \ndetermined assuming velocity equivalence with the particles where particle fall velocities \nhave been calculated from the Re \u2013 Cd relation for individual falling particles \nFF\nRe\nC particled \u2212+=\n\u2212 07.1224 828.0)(  7), \ngiven by Wilson and Huang [1979] (for ~0.1 < Re < 100). F is a particle shape factor which \nis 1 for a sphere and decreases with decreasing sphericity. Here, we use a value of F = 0.3 \nwhich best fits the fall velocity data of Riley et al. [Quantitative shape measurements of distal \nvolcanic ash, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research, 2001] for rhyolitic ash \nshards. The recalculated aggregate drag coefficient results are given in Figure 6a by the grey \nsymbols and plot significantly above the other data. \nTherefore, the aggregate drag coefficient values calculated for the individual \nmeasurements (open symbols, Figure 6a) follow the trend of the smallest values of the range \nbelieved to be possible from the horizontal separation experiments. Although the individual \nmeasurements do not rely on a fall velocity model (velocity was measured directly), they do \nrequire estimates for aggregate mass and an aerodynamic cross sectional area (A), both of \nwhich are calculated from the equivalent diameter as determined from the imaged area of the \n 13\nside of each aggregate. In order to assess if this simplification could be responsible \nfor significantly decreasing the calculated drag coefficient, the effect of changing the value of \nda was investigated. Simply altering da (thus changing both the calculated aggregate mass and \naerodynamic area) would require that da is generally doubled in order for the individual \nmeasurements to coincide with the shard-like particle-equivalence dispersal results. Given \nthat this is outside experimental errors for measurement of da and aggregate masses have \nbeen independently verified in this work, it has been discounted. Another possible source of \nerror is the aerodynamic area (A) alone but, in this case, A would have had to have been \noverestimated by a factor of four, which is believed to be unlikely. Therefore, the similarity \nbetween the results from individual measurements and the dispersal experiments where \nvelocity equivalence was assumed with falling particles modelled as spheres is not thought to \nbe coincidence and, given the lower degree of scatter in the latter data set, these results are \nused from now on. \nA power law best fit line to these data can be used to represent aggregate drag \ncoefficients, \n 637.023 \u2212= ReCd(agg)  8), \nhowever, the limited range (representing aggregate diameters between ~50 and 500 \u00b5m) of \nthe data dictates that this has been only demonstrated for 0.2<Re<20 (Figure 6a). Due to the \ndecreasing air density with height, experiments carried out at low pressures would be \nrequired in order for this trend to be extended to cover aggregates falling at altitude. A \npossible interim alternative would be to assume that the differences between the drag \ncoefficients of aggregates and spheres is a simple function of aggregate size rather than \ninvolving the flow dynamics. This would infer that, with respect to the flow dynamics, \naggregates do fall as spheres and that differences between the drag coefficients are mainly \ndue to errors in calculation of the aggregates\u2019 equivalent diameters. In this case, aggregate \ndrag coefficients can be formulated as a correction factor (a function of aggregate size alone) \nto the drag curve of a sphere. Here, the drag coefficients for spheres, Cd(sphere), have been \ncalculated from  experimental data given in Clift et al. [1978] (by using an empirical fit \nwhich had been derived previously in order to obtain fall velocity [James et al., 2002]). In \nFigure 6b, the ratio of aggregate drag coefficient to those calculated for spheres of equivalent \nsize and diameter is shown against aggregate diameter and a best line fit demonstrated. In \norder to nondimensionalise this, we introduce a dimensionless aggregate size factor Sa where \n \n50\na\na\nd\nS =  50<da<500 \u00b5m 9), \nand da is given in microns, allowing Cd(agg) to be given by  \n 14\n ( )[ ]ad(sphere)d(agg) SCC ln43.042.0 +\u00d7=  1<Sa<10 10). \nThis curve is plotted in Figure 6c to demonstrate its fit to the data and compare it to the \ndrag curve for spheres. The drag curve for infinite cylinders perpendicular to their axes \n[Hoerner, 1965] is also shown because it has been previously found relevant to larger \nvolcanic clasts [Walker et al., 1971]. The aggregate data appear to lie parallel to this curve \nbut cross the drag curve for spheres at Re \u2248 2.2 (equivalent to aggregates of diameter ~200 \n\u00b5m), with smaller aggregates having smaller and larger aggregates having larger drag \ncoefficients than similarly sized spheres. \nThe differences between the drag coefficients of aggregates and spheres could also be \ndue to several other effects. The commonly used Re-Cd curves for spheres [Hoerner, 1965; \nClift et al. 1978] assume that they are impermeable, non-rotating and rigid; none of which \ncan be assumed for aggregates. The images of landed aggregates demonstrate that they are \nmostly highly irregular in shape, with significantly sized internal pores. Air flow through a \npermeable aggregate would reduce the pressure differential across it, thus reducing drag, and \nthis has been shown to be a substantial effect for fractal aggregates in water [Johnson and \nLogan, 1996].  If this is the cause of our aggregate data falling off the drag curve for spheres \n(Figure 6c) then it would suggest that the effect of air flow through an aggregate is greater for \nsmaller aggregates. This is qualitatively supported by the constant aggregate porosity \nsuggested by constant density, although, images of landed aggregates (Figure 2) do suggest \nthat larger pores may exist in larger aggregates. \nShape factors (most aggregates are far from spherical) will also change drag \ncoefficients from those of spheres. Highly irregular shapes and rough surfaces are likely to \nincrease drag and may also induce rotation or oscillation, which would further increase the \ndrag coefficient. Although rapid rotations have not been observed [James et al., 2002], as \naerodynamic forces increase, aggregates may also change shape as they fall. In the case of \nraindrops, which change shape from spheres to a flatter morphology with increasing fall \nvelocity, this increases drag coefficients for Re > 300 [Pruppacher and Klett, 1997].  \n \n5. Discussion \nPreviously, it has been suggested that the growth of larger aggregates may be \ndominantly due to the collection of smaller aggregates, rather than from the continuous \naccretion of individual particles [James et al., 2002]. Our images of collapsed aggregates \n(Figure 2) support this, demonstrating irregular shapes, fractal-like self-similarity and the \npresence of significant internal voids which are believed to represent the boundaries between \n 15\naccumulated aggregates. For aggregates larger than ~700 \u00b5m, internal structures \nwere generally not observed but we believe that this is due to their collapse on landing. \nWe consider that the generation of the smallest, \u2018primary\u2019 aggregates probably occurs \nrapidly after or during the production of the particles from the pumice fragmentation. The \npumice-fragmentation method generates particles both positively and negatively electrically \ncharged, with high charge to mass ratios (specific charges) of up to 10-3 C kg-1 [James et al., \n2000]. During the collision of the pumice samples, the particles generated will be in intimate \ncontact within small crush zones on the pumice surfaces and, immediately after the \nseparation of the samples, the particles are at their highest number density within the air. \nTherefore, during these times, because for small, closely spaced, electrically charged \nparticles, electrostatic forces can easily dominate those of gravity [Blythe and Reddish, \n1979], interactions between the smallest particles are most abundant. Larger particles \ngenerally have significantly lower specific charges and are therefore more influenced by \ngravitational rather than electrostatic forces [Blythe and Reddish, 1979]. Thus, the formation \nof an initial aggregate population is likely to be mainly the result of a high number of particle \ncollisions due to small particle separation distances and relatively strong electrostatic forces. \nSome of the smaller aggregates observed (Figure 2) demonstrate a delicate and fingering \nform, similar to that of aggregates of latex spheres produced under microgravity, the \nformation of which is dominated by inertial and electrostatic forces [Blum, 2000]. \nAs aggregates grow they will accumulate particles with both positive and negative net \ncharges. Consequently, the charge to mass ratio of a growing aggregate will rapidly decrease \nfrom that of an individual particle to that of all the particles as a whole (which can be a \ndecrease of several orders of magnitude [James et al., 2000]). Thus, with increasing \naggregate size, electrostatic attraction will become decreasingly important for inducing \ncollisions and fall velocity differences will become the dominant collision mechanism. \nHowever, electrostatic attraction is likely to retain its importance for particle binding \nbecause, when particles are in contact, attraction forces are dominated by the closest centres \nof charge (i.e. those on the neighbouring particles) rather than that of the aggregate as a \nwhole. \nFalling aggregates will collide with and accrete other aggregates and, as they grow, fall \nvelocity differences between them and larger single particles will decrease. We believe that \nthis eventually allows larger particles to be incorporated into aggregates rather than \n\u2018punching through\u2019 or disaggregating them during collisions. We thus view the primary \ngrowth mechanism for electrostatic aggregates as a spectrum ranging from being dominated \nby electrostatic forces for the smallest aggregates, to being dominated by fall velocity \ndifferences at larger diameters. It is tempting to speculate that, within our apparatus, the \n 16\nchanges in component particle size distributions for growing aggregates (Figures 3a \nand b) suggest that this transition in dominant aggregate growth mechanism occurs at around \nan aggregate size of ~150 \u00b5m. It is possible that this is also reflected in aggregate size \ndistributions and discontinuities in distributions at aggregate equivalent diameters of ~150 \nand 50 \u00b5m were shown by James et al. [2002], for experimental aggregates collected after \n0.5 and 1.1 m of fall respectively (their Figure 3a). Although these were initially interpreted \nas being probably due to the remaining presence of populations of small, individual, non-\naggregated particles, we now believe that it is more likely that these populations comprised \nsmall aggregates whose growth had been dominated by electrostatic attraction, which had yet \nto be scavenged into larger aggregates. \nIn this paper, we have used component particle size distributions and mass \nmeasurements of experimentally produced electrostatic aggregates to produce a model of the \naggregate components and to analyse aggregate drag coefficients. However, a key difference \nbetween our experimental apparatus and the environment within a plume is the lack of \nrecirculation and large-scale turbulence within the apparatus. Both of these phenomena may \naffect aggregation and disaggregation processes. During the experiments, turbulence was \nlimited to that produced by the particle production apparatus and the falling particles \nthemselves. The effect of turbulence on aggregation mechanisms (studied for other \napplications and environments) is complex and varies with the fluid properties, the strength \nof the turbulence and the sizes of the aggregating material and aggregates produced \n[Pruppacher and Klett, 1997]. Although the presence of turbulence is likely to increase the \nprobability of particles colliding [Pruppacher and Klett, 1997], it may also be directly \nresponsible for breaking up large aggregates. For electrostatically charged silicate particles, \nthe situation is further complicated by the unknown distribution of charges on individual \nparticles which prevents any realistic estimate of the degree to which electrostatic forces will \ninteract with other aggregation mechanisms. Within  plumes, the turbulence strength varies \nwith time and position and, depending on the intensity of particle and aggregate \nsedimentation, its influence on aggregation processes may be subsequently overprinted by \ninteractions within the particulate material as it sediments through the atmosphere. \nAggregation and disaggregation processes will occur simultaneously within plumes, \nwith aggregate break-up being strongly controlled by aggregate strengths. Due to the \ninsulating nature of the silicate particles and poor knowledge of the charge distributions \ninvolved, the magnitudes of the binding electrostatic forces within aggregates are difficult to \nestimate. However, it is possible that aggregate strength could be assessed from the collapse \npatterns of different sized aggregates, with images of aggregates larger than ~700 \u00b5m \nsuggesting that they land with an impact energy sufficient to break off some material and \n 17\ncollapse (Figure 2), whereas, in general, smaller aggregates remain intact. Thus, an \nestimate of the forces exerted during the landing of a ~700 \u00b5m aggregate may represent the \neffective binding force within aggregates. If this force, Fl, is assumed to act constantly over \nthe period during which an aggregate collapses completely onto a surface, t, then its \nmagnitude can be estimated from the change in momentum \n vmtFl \u2206\u22c5=  10), \nwhere, for a 700 \u00b5m aggregate of density 200 kg m-3, its mass, m, will be 3.6\u00d710-8 kg and its \nfall velocity, v, 0.86 m s-1. If the aggregate\u2019s velocity is assumed to decrease linearly during \nimpact (from when the leading edge touches the surface to when the trailing edge lands), it \nwill collapse during a time period, t, of 1.6 ms. This gives force of order 10-5 N which would \nrepresent an upper limit for the binding force of electrostatic aggregates. Note that from \nFl=ma, where a is acceleration, this implies that aggregates can withstand accelerations of up \nto ~50g. This is undoubtedly an overestimate, but does suggest that aggregates may be more \nresilient within a turbulent environment than perhaps expected. It is also possible, if not \nhighly likely, that aggregates can respond to aerodynamic forces by adjusting their shape, \nrather than breaking up. \nDespite the lack of turbulence within our experiments, their relevance to aggregation \nwithin volcanic plumes is supported by the similarities between our results and those of the \nlimited previous field and numerical modelling work carried out on deposits. James et al. \n[2002] showed that measured fall velocities for laboratory aggregates coincided with those \nrequired by the numerical plume model of Carey and Sigurdsson [1982] in order to \nreconstruct the deposit produced by the May 18, 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The data \npresented here also allows the particle sizes involved to be considered. In order to reconstruct \nthe particle size distribution due to aggregates within a deposit, the relative abundance of the \ndifferent aggregate sizes must be known. However, Equation 2 reflects that, for aggregates \n>140 \u00b5m, the shape of the component particle size distribution (and thus the diameter at \nwhich it peaks, when given on a particle volume basis) does not appear to be a function of the \naggregate diameter. Therefore, any deposit dominated by aggregates larger than ~140 \u00b5m in \nequivalent diameter will have the same volume maximum (in this case, at ~14 \u00b5m if the \nparticles are assumed to be spheres or ~9 \u00b5m if they are represented as disks). This correlates \nwell with the data of Carey and Sigurdsson [1982] who demonstrated a nearly constant fine \nmode (at 13 \u00b5m) in the bimodal fall deposit (up to 450 km from the volcano) produced by the \nMay 18, 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. Although our aggregate density results suggest that \na value of 200 kg m-3 is applicable for aggregates up to at least ~700 \u00b5m in equivalent \ndiameter, for larger aggregates, a slightly lower value may be appropriate. However, we see \n 18\nno physical reason why aggregates should start to accumulate material in a less dense \nstructure, which would be necessary for aggregate densities to decrease. \nThe calculated aggregation coefficients demonstrate that, even without recirculation \nwithin our apparatus, a significant proportion of the smallest particles must be incorporated \ninto aggregates. With a relative aggregation coefficient of ~1 for all analysed particles <10 \n\u00b5m (down to 4 \u00b5m) the effect of aggregation must be considered when assessing the \ndeposition of these respirable particles for health hazards. This lack of diameter dependence \nfor the aggregation coefficients of these particles suggests that their presence in aggregates is \nlimited only by their abundance in the original particle size distribution. Given that the \nsmallest aggregates, which are dominated by component particles in this size range, should \nbe least susceptible to break-up by turbulence, then we expect that in all plumes, a \nconsiderable fraction of these sized particles will be present as small aggregates. For particles \nsmaller than ~60 \u00b5m electrostatic aggregation coefficients have been shown to be similar to \nthose previously calculated for accretionary lapilli [Gilbert and Lane, 1994]. However, \naccretionary lapilli are significantly more efficient at incorporating larger (i.e. >80 \u00b5m) \nparticles than electrostatic aggregates, which is to be expected given that surface tension, the \ndominant initial binding mechanism for accretionary lapilli [Gilbert and Lane, 1994; \nSchumacher and Schminke, 1995], will provide much stronger binding forces for larger \nparticles than could be available from electrostatic charges. To what degree the size of the \nlargest incorporated particles (Figure 3c) within the experimental aggregates (which appears \nto tend to ~100 \u00b5m) may have been determined by the total \u2018starting\u2019 particle size \ndistribution is difficult to assess. However, given that the calculated aggregation coefficients \n(Figure 5b) begin to decrease rapidly at component particle sizes of ~70 \u00b5m, then we suspect \nthat the maximum incorporated particle sizes were controlled mainly by the aggregation \nprocess rather than the initial particle size distribution. \nGiven that particle aggregation processes within plumes are still poorly understood, we \nbelieve that the presence of electrostatically bound aggregates should not be viewed as  \nexcluding the production of accretionary lapilli. This is supported by our own unpublished \nfield observations of simultaneous sedimentation of both types of aggregate at Sakurajima \nvolcano, Japan. Our experiments have demonstrated that electrostatic aggregates form \nextremely rapidly and it is entirely possible that subsequent accretionary lapilli growth could \noccur by the accumulation of previously produced electrostatic aggregates. Due to their \ndelicate nature, any characteristic structures within electrostatic aggregates would not be \nexpected to survive collision with an accretionary lapilli, thus evidence for the process may \nbe difficult to detect. The same particle collision mechanisms are involved in both types of \naggregation and depend on fluid motion and the physical, electrical and aerodynamic \n 19\nproperties of the particles and aggregates. Only after collision are surface tension \nforces relevant for particles covered with liquid layers and hence the particle binding \nefficiencies for dry and wet aggregates will be significantly different.  \n \n6. Conclusions \nThe experiments have demonstrated that, despite their irregular shapes, aggregates \ncan be represented as spheres with a density of ~200 kg m-3 and a drag coefficient given by \neither Equation 8 or 10. Size analysis of their component particles has shown exponential-\ntype cumulative distributions and these have been represented by Equations 2 and 3. \nAggregation coefficients calculated using this model indicate that respirable particles <10 \u00b5m \nin diameter have a high and uniform probability of being incorporated into aggregates. \nImages of landed aggregates indicate that aggregates smaller than ~140 \u00b5m are likely to be \nproduced extremely rapidly and that larger aggregates grow dominantly by the accumulation \nof these smaller aggregates, but are also capable of incorporating significantly larger \nparticles, possibly as their relative fall velocities decrease. \n \n 20\nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by The Leverhulme Trust (F\/00 185A) and The Royal Society \n(574006.G503\/19679).

The aggregates were imaged on glass \nplates using transmitted light. The uppermost aggregate demonstrates the typical collapse \nmorphology of large aggregates (>700 \u00b5m), with no discernable internal structure, a \ngenerally circular outline and a surrounding halo of broken off particles. This can be \ncompared with the smaller aggregates (<700 \u00b5m) which show much less evidence of collapse \nand spreading on impact and demonstrate considerable internal porosity, irregular outlines \nand few detached particles. \n \nFigure 3. Particles contained within aggregates. In a), the total number of component \nparticles larger than 1.4 \u00b5m in individual aggregates are shown. For aggregates with \nequivalent diameters >150 \u00b5m, the number of component particles follows a near cubic \nrelation, supporting a constant density sphere representation for the aggregates. Although \nonly two significantly smaller aggregates were investigated, they suggest a shallower slope \nfor aggregates <150 \u00b5m in equivalent diameter. In order to illustrate the sensitivity of the \n 25\ndata to the number of the smallest particles, error bars have been plotted representing \nthe total number of apparent particles counted in each aggregate which have calculated \ndiameters smaller than the theoretical resolution of the microscope optics (see text).

The aggregate equivalent diameters are given in the key (in microns) and the grey \ndashed line represents the deposit as a whole. For clarity, only data <70 \u00b5m have been \nplotted, however, most of the aggregates showed small numbers of significantly larger \ncomponent particles, the maximum diameters of which are given in c).

The solid symbols give data obtained with a 300 \u00b5m orifice tube, using \nparticles which were sieved at 250 \u00b5m and the open symbols give data obtained with a 120 \n\u00b5m orifice tube, after sieving at 70 \u00b5m. Ratioing the model results and the 300 \u00b5m data set \nfor particles >10 \u00b5m gives a relative aggregation coefficient which is plotted in b) along with \nthe aggregation coefficient determined by Gilbert and Lane [1994] for accretionary lapilli. \n \nFigure 6.

The solid black symbols give the drag coefficients calculated from \naggregate distributions (where velocity equivalence is assumed with single falling particles \nmodelled as spheres [James et al., 2002]) and solid grey symbols represent results from the \nsame data but recalculated for velocity equivalence with single particles modelled using the \nWilson and Huang [1979] drag curve (see text).
