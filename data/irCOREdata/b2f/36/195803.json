We discuss the challenges of \ndelivering distance learning courses faced by the Occupational Psychology (OP) team \nand how these were addressed by a range of coordinated curriculum design and delivery \nmeasures. Within those measures, we focus on the contribution of podcasting to the \ntransformation of the OP curricula. In this study, the term \u2018podcast\u2019 is used to refer to a \ndigital media file that plays sound or video, and that is available from a website for \nplayback on a portable device (Salmon, Mobbs, Edirisingha and Dennett 2008). In the \nlight of earlier research, we evaluate the potential of podcasting in distance education. \nWe describe our research methods and demonstrate how the podcasts were developed and \nintegrated into the two OP curricula. We present and discuss our key findings. We \nconclude by contextualising the impact of this research on curriculum renewal at an \ninstitutional level.  \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding author. Email: mn79@leicester.ac.uk \n \nM. Nie et al \nBackground \nPodcasting captured the attention of academics in higher education in 2005. In the USA, \none of the first initiatives involving extensive use of podcasting began at Duke \nUniversity, where first-year students were given iPods for listening to podcasting \napplications (http:\/\/www.duke.edu\/ddi\/) that included course content, classroom \nrecordings, field recordings and study support (Belanger 2005).  \nApple defines a podcast as \u2018an episodic program delivered via the internet using \nan XML protocol called RSS\u2019 (Apple 2010). The distribution technology used for a \npodcast is what distinguishes it from other forms of digital audio or video files on the \ninternet. A podcast is often distributed through a syndication feed, such as a Really \nSimple Syndication (RSS) feed or a virtual learning environment (VLE). Users can \nsubscribe to podcasts via an RSS feed, so that when new podcasts are released, they are \ndownloaded automatically onto a user\u2019s computer or mobile device such as an iPod or \nMP3 player (Beldarrain 2006; EDUCAUSE 2005; Gribbins 2007). \nHowever, in higher education many lecturers deliver their audio files via their \nuniversities\u2019 VLEs, with or without syndication. The digital audio files developed for this \nstudy were all in MP3 format and were delivered via the university\u2019s VLE. Students were \nnot required to subscribe to an RSS feed to access the podcasts. In this paper, we have \nadopted the broader definition of podcast suggested by Salmon, Mobbs, Edirisingha and \nDennett (2008), who described a podcast as a digital media file that plays sound or video, \nis made available from a website and can be downloaded and played on a computer or a \nportable player. \nA review of the literature \nAudio has long been effective in distance education. Durbridge (1984) of the UK\u2019s Open \nUniversity identified five key advantages of audio for distance learners: responding to \nsound as in understanding spoken language; listening in on conversations; being \u2018talked \nthrough\u2019 tasks; hearing facts, discussion and opinions from experts in their field; and \nbeing encouraged by the voice of someone they know and respect. She concluded that the \nunique feature of audio over written materials is its ability to influence cognition by \nadding clarity and motivation, through conveying a sense of immediacy. Audio \npodcasting offers a means of addressing isolation by bridging the gap between teachers \nand learners. Isolation experienced by distance learners is a major cause of drop-out \nacross all levels (Peters 1992; Keane, de la Varee, Irvin and Hanum 2008). Drop-out rates \nin distance education typically range from 20 to 50%, depending on the nature and level \nof the course (see, for example, Xenos, Pierrakeas and Pintelas 2002; Pierrakeas, Xenos, \nPanagiotakopoulos and Vergidis 2004).  \nMore recently, Salmon and Edirisingha (2008) described a wide range of \npedagogical applications of podcasting to support diverse disciplines and subjects. They \nhighlighted the potential of podcasting to bring to learners immediacy, engagement and \nstimulation (Fothergill 2008), convey more personalised and individualised content \n(France and Ribchester 2008) and enable students to experience better quality contact \nwith their lecturers (Cox, Macharia, Short and Whittlestone 2008). Podcasts providing \ninput, assessment guidelines and feedback were found effective in supporting students\u2019 \nassessed work (Sutton-Brady, Scott, Taylor, Carabetta and Clark 2009). Although most \nM. Nie et al \nof these case studies were based on podcasting to campus-based learners, the same \napproaches are transferable to distance learning.  \nAmong distance learners, student-created podcasts have succeeded in promoting a \nsense of belonging to a learning community and in reducing the students\u2019 feelings of \nisolation (Lee and Chan 2007; Lee and Tynan 2008). The same study demonstrated the \naffordance of podcasting in terms of enabling tutors to produce content \u2018on the fly\u2019 and \naddress distance learners\u2019 needs in a timely fashion (Lee and Chan 2007, 89). Additional \npedagogical benefits attributed to podcasting, as summarised by Lazzari (2009), include \nsignificant increases in final project grades and students\u2019 receptiveness to material being \npresented in that format for learning and revision purposes. \nA number of challenges associated with podcasting have also been identified, \nsuch as students\u2019 lack of awareness of the learning potential of this technology and the \nneed for technical support and buy-in from academics (Maag 2006). The \u2018novelty effect\u2019 \nis also mentioned in the literature in relation to podcasts (Hew 2009). Appropriate \nprovision for hearing-impaired students must be made (EDUCAUSE 2005) by making \nthe content available in usable formats that conform with accessibility regulations. Some \nresearch suggests that in certain contexts podcasts are not popular with learners (Cann \n2007) and that they may not affect learning in any significant way (Deal 2007). \nAs is the case with all new and emerging learning technologies, podcasting may \nnot be appropriate for every teaching and learning context (Beldarrain 2006). However, \npodcasting can help bridge many gaps in distance education, particularly by improving \nteacher contact and student support. \nContext \nThe University of Leicester\u2019s School of Psychology is one of the few places in the UK to \noffer the opportunity to study OP through distance learning. The OP team started \ndelivering two distance-taught programmes in 2000: the MSc in Occupational \nPsychology and the Diploma\/MSc in the Psychology of Work. Between them, these \nprogrammes attract about 50 part-time students per year. Almost all students are in \nemployment throughout their studies. Each programme involves six 20-credit modules \nand a 60-credit dissertation over two years. All modules are compulsory. There is no on-\ncampus equivalent of these programmes. From 2000 to 2006, both programmes were \ndelivered through printed materials posted to students, who submitted their assignments \nand dissertations on paper. They received hand-written summative and formative \nfeedback. \nIn 2006 the OP team began to develop significantly its use of the Blackboard VLE \nbeyond a document repository to enhance the delivery of the programmes. Initially, the \nteam used Blackboard\u2019s discussion board to enable students and staff to communicate \nand work collaboratively. Tutor-moderated discussion forums provided guidance on the \ncontent and assignments for each module. Later, the team extended the use of discussion \nboards to support and supervise learners at all stages of preparing the dissertation, from \ninitial ideas to final submission. Course materials have now been supplemented with \nweb-based versions and active links to course readings. Blackboard is now the central \nhub for all student resources. Since 2007, students have submitted their assignments and \ndissertations through Blackboard\u2019s online submission system, and marking by tutors is \nnow fully electronic.  \nM. Nie et al \nThe design and delivery of both OP programmes have seen major developments \nsince 2006. The podcasts were part of a suite of changes as the course moved into its '2nd \ngeneration', i.e. interactive e-learning as opposed to using the VLE primarily as a \nrepository of materials for distance learners.  Podcasts are integral to how the OP tutors \nteach now and constitute the focus of the research reported here. \n \nSince 2006, the OP team have been systematically addressing four key challenges in \ncurriculum design and delivery, all common enough in distance learning: \n \n improving learner engagement with materials and with each other by offering \nenhanced guidance, support and feedback in a variety of media formats;  \n enhancing flexibility in a programme aimed primarily at time-poor work-based \nlearners; \n reducing learner isolation through the provision of additional opportunities for \nstudent-student and student-tutor interactions; \n identifying ways to ensure good retention rates, which can be a particular problem for \ndistance courses. \n \nThe team have focused on enhancing the overall learning experience of distance and \nwork-based learners on both programmes. The development and incorporation of \npodcasts, as reported in this paper, was part of that enhancement. \nPodcasting in the Occupational Psychology curricula \nOn the basis of previous research on pedagogical applications of podcasting, the OP \nteam, in collaboration with the Beyond Distance Research Alliance, planned, developed \nand incorporated podcasts into the design and delivery of both postgraduate programmes. \nOther significant enhancements included the improvement and streamlining of online \nmaterials, revised dissertation and early assignment processes, systematic e-moderation \nof forums, online marking and added quality and consistency in the marking. This suite \nof changes, gradually implemented between 2006 and 2009, was aimed at addressing the \nchallenges outlined above. \nBetween April and December 2009, the OP team produced 59 podcasts in five \ncategories (summarised in Table 1): (1) module overview (for two of the modules), (2) \nresearch methods, (3) assignment guidance and support, (4) dissertation guidance and \nsupport, and (5) formative feedback on draft dissertations. The fifth category was not part \nof the original project, but an initiative by the OP team based on their previous \npodcasting experience. \n \n[Table 1 about here] \n \nAll learners had access to the module overview, research methods, assignment and \ndissertation podcasts through the VLE (See Figure 1). Podcasts providing formative \nfeedback on students\u2019 dissertation drafts were made available to individual learners. The \npodcasts in this fifth category were not reusable. However, general feedback points were \nintegrated into the podcasts under the fourth category, which were accessible by all and \nreusable across programmes. All podcasts were produced by four members of the OP \nM. Nie et al \ncourse team using a free software package called Audacity (http:\/\/audacity.download-\nlatest.com), with minimum input from learning technologists. \n \n[Figure 1 here] \nA podcast planning tool \nA simple tool was used to plan each podcast (see example in Table 2, used to plan a \npodcast entitled What makes a good research question?). The grid helped the OP tutors \nto focus on the purpose and key messages that they wanted to deliver in each podcast.   \nThe maximum recommended length of a podcast is 10 minutes (Edirisingha, Salmon and \nNie 2008). Some of the 59 podcasts feature a single OP tutor but most include the input \nof two, three or four tutors. Although carefully planned and structured, all podcasts are \ninformal and relaxed. They were largely unscripted and designed to motivate and engage \nOP learners. \n  \n[Table 2 here] \n \nMethodology \nIn the context of the two OP Masters programmes at Leicester, our research question \nwas: what is the contribution of podcasting to curriculum design and delivery. The \nresearch was conducted using action research methodology that involves the \u2018action-\nreflection\u2019 cycle (McNiff and Whitehead 2006, 9). The action-reflection cycle started \nbefore the creation of the podcasts. Through surveys and interviews, OP staff and \nstudents were consulted on the challenges faced in course design and delivery from the \nvery start of the project. Their views were analysed and results were fed back to the OP \nteam to inform the course redesign. As podcasts were incorporated into the redesign, \nfeedback from students and staff was regularly gathered and analysed. Evidence was fed \nback to the OP team to inform the next set of design changes. \nBefore the incorporation of podcasts, all members of the OP staff were consulted \non curriculum design and delivery issues through meetings and informal discussions. \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with a self-selected sample of seven students \nto find out the issues and challenges they faced in their studies, their views on how they \ncould be addressed and the role of technology in the possible solutions.  \nTwo VLE-based student surveys were also administered: (a) a standard module \nsurvey and (b) a survey designed to capture learners\u2019 ideas on how podcasting might \nenhance their learning (the \u2018technology survey\u2019). Students were recruited on a voluntary \nbasis. Each respondent was rewarded with a \u00a310 Amazon online voucher. The surveys \nwere completed by students on both OP programmes but from different cohorts (see \nTables 3 and 4). \n[Table 3 here] \n[Table 4 here] \nAfter the incorporation of podcasts, evidence collecting was focused on their impact on \nstaff and students. The impact of podcasting on the staff\u2019s experience was captured \nthrough informal, regular meetings with the OP team. Semi-structured interviews were \nM. Nie et al \nagain conducted with seven students to find out their overall experience of using the \npodcasts. All seven students had listened to some of the available podcasts and \nvolunteered to be interviewed. Four of them were among the seven who had been \ninterviewed before the incorporation of the podcasts. Data from interviews were \nsupplemented by the comments and feedback contributed by students through the VLE-\nbased surveys and via the discussion board. All the students who were involved in the \ninterview were mature work-based distance learners in full-time employment. Six of the \ninterviewees were female and one was male. \nQuantitative data collected from the online surveys were transferred into Excel \nspreadsheets and descriptive statistics were applied to close-ended questions. Qualitative \ndata from interviews, surveys and discussion boards were coded using data-driven \n(inductive) coding (Boyatzis 1998) and analysed using thematic analysis (Boyatzis 1998; \nJoffe and Yardley 2004) to identify categories and combine categories into themes.  \nResults \nPodcasting made a major contribution to how the two Masters programmes are delivered \nand extended the ways in which students were supported. Key findings on the impact of \npodcasting on students and staff are presented below. \nThe human dimension \nThe distance learners on these programmes, who were largely work-based, valued highly \nthe production and delivery of personalised content through podcasting. Consultation \nwith students before the incorporation of podcasts showed that, typical for distance \nlearning courses, they perceived a need for more personalisation in the curricula. The \nevidence showed that podcasting added a human dimension to the learning experience. \nCompared with reading course materials, articles and textbooks, listening to the tutors\u2019 \nvoices added a personal touch and livened up the learning experience. The following \nstudent quotations illustrate this: \n \nI feel [a] more personalised service when I can hear the voice from the podcasts. (Survey) \n \nIt [podcasting] makes the course less impersonal. For example, listening to the lecturer\u2019s \nvoice on podcasts is a big improvement than reading notes. (Survey) \n \nSometimes it seems cold when you receive [feedback] on paper. In a podcast, [the tutor] \nsays, \u2018you\u2019ve done well\u2019, you can feel something personal. (Interview) \n \nStudents considered that listening to a podcast resembled \u2018direct communication\u2019. They \nfelt that they received more of their tutors\u2019 time and that it was possible to \u2018have a \nconversation\u2019 with them. As a result of that, students felt less \u2018distant\u2019 and \u2018isolated\u2019, but \nmore \u2018connected\u2019 with their tutors.  \n \nThe most interesting thing was hearing someone\u2019s voice. I didn\u2019t feel quite so distant. (Survey) \n \nPodcasts made me feel closer to my tutors and I think they help you to build a relationship with \nthem. (Survey) \n \nM. Nie et al \nOver time, by listening to the tutors\u2019 voices, learners were able to build a relationship \nwith their tutors, which is often difficult in distance learning. \nSupport, guidance and feedback \nPodcasts increased learner engagement with the guidance and support that was already \navailable on both programmes. They enabled tutors to convey important and detailed \nmessages in an effective and motivating manner, which was highly appreciated by \nstudents. Tutors offered and students benefited from feedback in a way that had not been \npossible before, which generated a valuable form of interaction between tutors and \nlearners. \nStudents pointed out that the assignment podcasts \u2018make the instructions clearer\u2019; \n\u2018give clearer guidance\u2019 and \u2018clarify everything\u2019. As one student put it: \n \nThanks for the podcasts. I\u2019ve found them very helpful. I managed to understand more what we are \nexpected from MA 1. [Module assignment 1] (Survey) \n \nStudents also found listening to the podcasts \u2018consolidating\u2019 and \u2018reassuring\u2019. Through \nthe surveys, they commented: \n \nIt [the podcast] sets you in the right direction. \n \nIt reconfirmed a lot of what I had read already. \n \nIt reassured that I was on the right lines. \n \nI feel comfortable that I\u2019m on the right track. \n \nThe guidance provided on how to approach dissertations and assignments gave students \ninformation that they regarded as useful, for instance, in terms of time management. \nWhile this guidance had previously been provided in written format, learners engaged \nwith and related to it differently and positively when it was delivered to them through the  \ntutor\u2019s voice. \nPodcasting offered tutors a quick and effective mechanism to provide guidance, \nexplanations and feedback. One tutor concluded: \n \nIt\u2019s amazing how much information you can pack in a 3-5 minute podcast. The material that might \ntake 4-5 pages to write can be covered in a 4-5 minute podcast. Again, in terms of time-saving, the \nlecturer may not have 5-6 hours to write something, but he or she has half an hour to do a podcast. \n(Tutor A) \n \nAnother tutor added: \nFor a 5-minute podcast, I only need to plan half an hour to complete the recording and editing. It\u2019s \na very fast and efficient way to turn things around. (Tutor B) \n \nThe availability of podcasts provided additional opportunities for learners to benefit from \nguidance, support and feedback in different ways, which helped reduce learner isolation. \nThe value of podcasts and the asynchronous tutor-learner interaction that they foster was \nuniversally acknowledged by students. \nM. Nie et al \nFlexibility and mobility \nThe integration of podcasting into design and delivery also had an impact on the learners\u2019 \napproaches to learning. Surveys and interviews showed that students used the podcasts in \nvarious ways.  Some listened to the podcasts on computers or laptops at home or in the \noffice. Some played the podcasts on their mobile devices (such as MP3 players, iPods \nand iPhones) in public places or on the move. The following two quotations illustrate \nhow students used the podcasts, and suggest that podcasting has the potential to address \nsome of the flexibility and mobility challenges in work-based learning that were \nidentified by the OP team: \n \nI use my MP3 player especially for the podcasts. I downloaded them to my MP3 player and \nlistened to them any time on my way. (Interview) \n \nI was able to download the dissertation podcasts on the computer and then onto my iPhone. This \nmade it easy to listen when I had a spare gap. This was useful and enabled me to think things \nthrough while I was at work or out. (Survey) \n \nMaking podcasts available in formats suited to different mobile devices (including e-\nbook readers with MP3 compatibility) increased flexibility, which was appreciated by the \ntime-poor students on both programmes. \nDesign once, deliver many times \nThere is indicative evidence that the clarity associated with these podcasts had a positive \nimpact on tutors\u2019 workloads. Before the incorporation of podcasts into the curricula, OP \nstudents used the VLE discussion boards or email to enquire about administrative, \noperational and \u2018housekeeping\u2019 issues, many of which had been explicitly addressed in \nthe programme handbook. Tutors reported that students did not always read the \nhandbook. These queries did not require specific academic support. Tutors had the time-\nconsuming and mundane task of dealing, in writing, with similar non-academic questions \nfrom students. Although some students still do not make appropriate use of the resources \nand continue to email standard queries to the team, the podcasts dealt with the vast \nmajority of recurrent issues raised by learners in a clear, friendly and efficient manner. In \nconsequence, tutors perceived a notable reduction in the number of non-academic \nquestions requiring their attention on the discussion board.  \nThe podcasting planning tool (Table 2) was considered to be useful by the OP \ntutors. Breaking the podcast into sections helped them to stay focused on the key \nobjectives. As they grew more and more familiar with the technology and as they gained \nproduction experience, tutors adopted, over time, an informal, unscripted style that \nengaged and motivated learners. Tutors were able to \u2018design once and deliver many \ntimes\u2019 by transferring content between podcasts with minimum adaptation and \nversioning, which has contributed to the sustainability of the innovation. \nAllowing for individual differences within the team, OP tutors generally found \ncreating podcasts easy, quick and intuitive. Using free, stable software and their own \nvoices, they were able to offer students support, guidance and personalised feedback in a \ncost-effective manner. \nM. Nie et al \nDiscussion \nThis paper reported on the contribution of podcasting to curriculum transformation in two \nOP programmes at the University of Leicester. Table 5 captures the key points associated \nwith each of the main findings. \n \n[Table 5 here] \n \nLearners were overwhelmingly satisfied with the incorporation of podcasts into the \ncurricula. They appreciated the added human touch and the opportunities to engage with \nthe material differently. In interviews, online surveys and contributions to the discussion \nboard, students used words such as \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018very helpful\u2019, \u2018very useful\u2019, \u2018motivating\u2019, \n\u2018beneficial\u2019, and \u2018reassuring\u2019 to describe their positive experience of using the podcasts. \nThe other technologies used in the project did not interfere with the high use of podcasts \nby students or with the production of podcasts by staff. The tutors\u2019 commitment to \ninnovation and curriculum renewal was outstanding throughout the process.  \nLimitations \nMost higher education institutions choose to deliver podcasts through their VLEs, as that \nis considered to be an environment that is both secure and familiar to staff and students. \nIn our case, making podcasts available through the university\u2019s VLE offers another \nadvantage: through the Blackboard Content Collection, staff can share podcasts across \ndifferent cohorts and departments. The Content Collection is an institutional content \nrepository, capable of supporting the sharing of content amongst courses and modules \nwithin the VLE. However, at the time of writing, RSS feeds were not available on our \ninstitutional version of Blackboard. Students have to log in to the VLE to download the \npodcasts onto their computers and mobile devices. Thus, podcasting has so far been used \nas a \u2018pull\u2019 rather than a \u2018push\u2019 technology (i.e. no syndication feeds have been used).  \nData collected after the incorporation of podcasts show that many students \nlistened to podcasts on their portable mobile devices, indicating the potential of \npodcasting to enhance the mobility and flexibility of student learning (Salmon and Nie \n2008). However, data from student interviews and surveys and informal comments from \nthe Blackboard discussion forum indicated that not every student was aware of the \npossibility of using podcasts on portable devices. Further research is needed to establish \nthe extent to which this awareness would translate into added benefit for learners.  \nInstitutional transformation  \nThe research into the impact of the curriculum redesign interventions described here, \nincluding the incorporation of podcasts into the OP curricula, has shown tangible and \ntransferable benefits to students and staff, while promoting pedagogical innovation.  \nThis kind of positive change is spreading at the University of Leicester. Pro-active \ninternal dissemination of findings undertaken by the OP team and BDRA, including \nMedia Zoo events (Armellini, Salmon and Hawkridge 2009), through the University\u2019s \nAssessment and Feedback Working Party, the Distance Learning Forum, Learning \nFutures Festival (http:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/beyonddistance\/festival) and the PANTHER \nseminar (http:\/\/bit.ly\/9k6E5C) have taken the outcomes of this research to other parts of \nthe university. Evidence gathered through the DUCKLING project and exemplars from \nM. Nie et al \nthe OP redesign experience have featured prominently in all of these events, which have \nconstituted excellent opportunities for sharing experiences and research findings in \ntechnology-enhanced curriculum transformation and delivery. Academic and support \nstaff from across the university have actively participated in the events and continue to do \nso. \nExposure to researched exemplars from the OP experience has motivated others \nto consider the incorporation of podcasting into curriculum design and delivery. So far, \npractitioners from six departments (Criminology, Engineering, Law, Lifelong Learning, \nManagement and Media and Communications) are now either redesigning parts of their \ncurricula by making use of podcasting or planning changes that may, in future, \nincorporate the findings of this research. On the evidence from DUCKLING and earlier \npodcasting projects, this technology is being used in creative ways to enhance learners\u2019 \nexperiences and improve efficiency across the institution. \nThe new Learning Innovation Strategy, approved by the University Senate in \n2009, provides an appropriate context for these innovations to take place in a supported \nway across the institution. Through internal, national and international dissemination, \nincluding conferences, publications and a significant online presence, our research into \npodcasting continues to inform institutional transformation and innovation well beyond \nthe University of Leicester. \nFuture research \nThe introduction of podcasts into both OP curricula was, as reported above, one of a suite \nof coordinated measures aimed at enhancing the experience of distance and work-based \nlearners. Retention and the quality of assessed work in relation to curriculum renewal and \npedagogical innovation have emerged as two key areas for future work. Firm conclusions \non them can only be reached over time and after several cohorts have completed the \nprogrammes. Indicative evidence suggests that as a result of the curriculum enhancement \nprocess, retention has marginally improved, as has the quality of the dissertation drafts. \nAn impact on these, if confirmed by future research, should be attributed to the range of \ncurriculum design and delivery changes implemented by the OP team in recent years, of \nwhich one was the podcasting. \nConclusions \nThis article provided an example of the effective use of podcasting within an ambitious \ncurriculum renewal initiative involving two Masters distance learning programmes in OP \naimed at work-based learners. The evidence shows that podcasting has enhanced the \nlearner experience by offering added personalisation, opportunities to benefit from \ncontent presented in a new format, increased curriculum flexibility and cost-\neffectiveness. The research and its proactive dissemination have highlighted the \nsustainability and transferability of these approaches to other institutional contexts. \nThe presentation of research evidence in a variety of usable formats has enabled \nothers across the university to relate to exemplars, adapt and test the ideas in their own \ncourses and contexts and promote pedagogical innovation. We will continue to research \nthe role of learning technology in institutional transformation through curriculum renewal \nand make our findings available for the benefit of the institution and the academic \ncommunity. \nM. Nie et al \nNotes \nThis research was part of a JISC-funded research project called DUCKLING (Delivering \nUniversity Curricula: Knowledge, Learning and INnovation Gains \n(http:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/duckling). DUCKLING aimed to enhance the experience of work-\nbased learners studying at a distance through the appropriate incorporation of three \ntechnologies: podcasting, Second Life and e-book readers. The two Masters in OP and \none in Applied Linguistics and TESOL were the target programmes for the innovations to \nbe implemented and researched. In this article we report on the first innovation, i.e. the \nincorporation of podcasts into the OP programmes. The research was led by the Beyond \nDistance Research Alliance (BDRA), a separate research unit at University of Leicester.  \n \nReferences \nApple Inc (2010). FAQs: For Podcast Fans.
