Introduction \nThe United Kingdom (UK), as is the case for many countries, faces an energy \nchallenge.  Reduced availability of domestic fossil fuels, rising fossil fuel prices and the \nneed to constrain greenhouse gas emissions means that the country must either reduce \nenergy consumption, import more energy, and\/or develop new domestic energy sources \nwith lower carbon footprints such as renewable energy. \n \nIn 2000, the UK Government\u201fs renewable energy policy [1] was to increase the \ncontribution of electricity supplied from renewables to 5% by the end of 2003 and to \n10% in 2010, assuming acceptable consumer costs.  More recently, the 2009 renewable \nenergy directives set a target for the UK to achieve 15% of its energy consumption from \nrenewable sources by 2020 [2].  It is considered that this could be achieved by \nsupplying 31% of the electricity demand, 10% of the transport demand and 12% of the \nheat demand [2].   In 2008, only about 2.3% of the delivered energy supply in the UK \ncame from renewable sources [3].  The proportion of electricity from renewable sources \n  \n \nwas 5.5%, and the proportions of transport fuel and energy for other use including heat \nwere about 1.4% each.   \n \nThe development of renewable energy sources, especially the cultivation of energy \ncrops, also has the potential to affect our national and global ecosystems and the \nservices they provide. These benefits provided by ecosystems have been termed \n\u201cecosystem services\u201d [4].   In some of the literature on ecosystem services, the focus is \non semi-natural and natural systems [5], however elsewhere the focus is on the full \nrange of ecosystems including agricultural and urban systems [4].  Within the context of \nthe UK, virtually all ecosystems are heavily affected by mankind and therefore this \npaper uses the wider interpretation. \n \nAuthors have generally found it useful to categorise the services that humans get from \necosystems into four or five functional groups which typically include production, \nregulating and cultural components (Table 1).  In addition to these groups De Groot [5] \nhighlights a \u201chabitat\u201d and a \u201ccarrier\u201d category.  He defines the carrier function as the \nprovision of a \u201cspace and suitable substrate to support infrastructure associated with \nhuman activities\u201d and gives examples of the capture of wind and solar energy and the \nfood production from cultivated land.   However as mentioned previously, in the context \nof the UK, it is useful to view agriculture as being an ecosystem in its own right, and \ntherefore this paper considers agricultural food production to be a production rather than \na carrier service.   \nTable 1. Ecosystem services can be categorised into five functional groups as described by De \nGroot et al [6] and De Groot [5].   The focus of this paper is on the production and carrier \nfunctions. \nFunctional \ngroup \nDescription Examples services \nProduction Production of carbohydrate \nstructures \nFood, animal feed, energy \nresources, genetic material \nCarrier Providing a space and substrate for \nhuman infrastructure \nHousing, transport, non-biomass \nenergy supply, waste storage \nRegulating Bio-geochemical cycles and \nbiospheric processes \nCarbon dioxide, oxygen, climate, \nwater and soil regulation \nCultural Providing opportunities for \ncognitive development \nRecreational and cultural spaces,  \nHabitat  Providing habitat for wild plants \nand animals \nDesignated conservation areas \n  \n \n \nThe research described in this paper was undertaken as part of a one year pilot project \nentitled \u201cEnergyscapes and Ecosystems Services\u201d which sought to describe and explain \nthe effect of different renewable energy systems on ecosystem services.  The aim of this \npaper is to develop a per capita approach to renewable energy demand and supply \nwithin a predefined geographical area and, through the use of scenarios, to illustrate \nsome of the key trade-offs and synergies between the production of renewable energy \n(electricity, transport, and heat) and the production of three other commodities, namely, \nfood, animal feed and wood. \nPlace Table 1 here. \n \n2. Methodology \n2.1 Case study area \nThe Marston Vale comprises 16094 ha to south and west of the county town of Bedford \nin southern England (Figure 1). The area is bordered by the Greensand Ridge in the \nsouth and a motorway (the M1) in the south-west.  Census data from 2001 indicates \nthere were 10646 households in the area, and assuming a mean of 2.4 people per \nhousehold in 2009 [7], this equates to 25550 people.  The area is also part of a \u201cgrowth \narea\u201d and therefore there has been government investment in transport infrastructure to \nsupport housing development, including a new town, called Wixams, close to the centre \nof the area.  In total it is estimated that development consent has been given for another \n10036 houses, which assuming the same number of people per household, would double \nthe population to 49637.  This higher population is equivalent of 0.32 ha per person (3.1 \npeople per ha).  This is intermediate between the mean values for England (3.9 people \nper ha) and the UK (2.5 people per ha), but higher than mean values for the European \nUnion (1.2 people per ha) or the world (0.46 people per ha).  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \na) Modelled land use in 2009 \n \nb) Land use in 2009 plus consented developments \n \n \nFig. 1. Modelled land use within the Marston Vale in 2009 a) without and b) with \nconsented development (UB = urban) \n \n \n  \n \n2.2 Mapping land use \nA digital map of the area was developed within a geographical information system \nARCGIS (ESRI Inc, 2009) using aerial photographs from June 2009 available from \nGoogle Earth (Google, 2010).  The field digitisation was performed at a basic scale of 1: \n5000 with a minimum mapping unit of 0.5 ha.  The land use within each polygon in the \nGIS was also coded into one of 17 categories which fall into three classes (Table 2) \n(Figure 1a). \n \nTable 2.  Categories of land use used within the geographical information system \nClass Categories \nAgricultural land Wheat, winter oilseed rape, spring oilseed rape, barley, \nbeans\/peas, other spring crop, fallow, bare soil, grass \nWoodland Woodland, woodland screening \nOther Water, urban, transport infrastructure, commercial area, \nlandfill, other  \n \nUsing current land use as a foundation, an additional category of \u201cConsented \ndevelopment\u201d was also created.  The existing polygons in the same areas were then sub-\ndivided into areas where development was consented or not (Figure 1b).  Lastly in order \nto facilitate statistical analysis, the land use polygons were expressed as values within a \ngrid of 100 m x 100 m pixels.  Because only those squares which lay completely within \nthe Marston Vale were selected, the area of pixel-based data (15565 ha) was 3% smaller \nthan the area of the Vale (16094 ha).  Using the pixel-based data, agriculture occupied \nabout 71% of the total area (Table 3) compared to a values of 75% for England and 77% \nfor the UK [8].   \n \nThe principal arable crops were wheat (27%) and oilseed rape (OSR) (9%), with smaller \nareas of barley (3%) and other crops including field beans and peas (7%); a significant \narea (6%) was also considered \u201cfallow\u201d. Grassland occupied 18% of the area, which is \nless than the average value for England (39%) and the UK (52%), as a result of the high \nproportion of arable land.   The other principal land use categories were woodlands \n(8%), urban (8%), other (9%), water (2%) and land-fill (2%) (Table 3).

One kWh is equivalent to 3600 kJ.  In 2002, the average world \ncitizen consumed the equivalent of 56 kWh d\n-1\n [10].  In 2008, the primary annual UK \nenergy use was 117 kWh d\n-1 \np\n-1\n, approximately twice the global average [3].  Because \nthe conversion of energy sources like coal and gas to electricity is typically about 30% \nefficient, the delivered energy is substantially lower.  In 2008, the mean delivered \nenergy per person in the UK was equivalent to 80 kWh d\n-1\n [3] (Table 4).    \n \nWithin Marston Vale, domestic energy use (electricity, transport, and heat and other) \nwas calculated using estimates of the number of households per ward, and the mean \nhousehold energy consumption for the two local authorities covering the area [11] \n(Table 4).   Electricity and heat energy use within commercial buildings was derived \n  \n \nfrom the plan area of the 88 largest warehouses and offices in the Marston Vale and \naverage benchmark values for fossil fuel and electricity use per unit area of the \ncommercial buildings [12].  The energy related to freight transport in the Vale was \nderived from freight transport energy use for the two local authority areas on a \nproportional area basis.  The energy use associated with arable and grassland production \nsystems were derived from land use data, agricultural statistics, and life cycle \nassessment values reported by Williams et al. [13].   The derived value of 81 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-\n1 \nfor the Vale is similar to the mean value of 80 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n for the UK (Table 4).   \n \nTable 4. Estimates of current energy use within Marston Vale and the UK.  The UK values also \ninclude illustrative renewable energy targets for 2020. \nArea Source Electricity Transport Heatc Total \nMarston  Domestic (GWh) 53 154 172 379 \nVale Commercial (GWh)a 75 168 97 340 \n Agricultural (GWh)\nb 12 13 12 35 \n Total (GWh) 140 335 281 754 \n Total (kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) 15 36 30 81 \nUK [14] Total (kWh p-1 d-1) c 15 34 31 80 \n Assumed proportion of renewables 0.31 0.10 0.12 0.15 \n Renewable target (kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) 4.6 3.4 3.7 11.7 \na\n: Commercial electricity and heat use based on area of warehouses (356500 m2) and offices (179400 m2).  \nAnnual mean fossil fuel and electricity use in warehousing estimated as 133 kWh m\n-2\n and 32 kWh m\n-2\n \nrespectively [12].  Annual mean fossil fuel and electricity use in offices (assumed double storey) at 138 \nkWh m\n-2\n and 177 kWh m\n-2\n respectively [12]. \nb\n: Estimate of 35 GWh for arable and grazing systems in the Marston Vale in 2009 was assumed to be \nsplit equally between electricity, transport and heat. \nc\n: Total delivered energy consumption in the UK in 2009 was 154.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent.  \nAssuming that one tonne of oil is equivalent to 11630 kWh and that the population of the UK is 61.4 \nmillion [7], mean energy use is 80 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.   Of this 29.4 million tonnes of oil was used for \nelectricity (15 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n), 64.9 million tonnes was for transport (34 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n), and the difference \nwas attributed to heat and other forms of energy (31 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n).   \n \nUsing the national values, the current demand was established for electricity (15 kWh p\n-\n1\n d\n-1\n), transport (34 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) and heat and other uses (31 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n).  As indicated \nearlier, the UK is seeking to achieve 15% of its energy consumption from renewable \nsources by 2020 [2], which would be equivalent to 31% of the electricity demand, 10% \nof the transport demand and 12% of the heat demand [2].  Applied to UK energy use in \n2008, this is equivalent to 4.6 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of electricity, 3.4 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of transport \nfuel, and 3.7 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of heat.  \n  \n \n2.4 Food demand \nIn the UK, the mean level of food energy purchased (including eating out and alcohol), \nfor people aged above seven years is about 2275 kcal per person per day [15] (Table 5).  \nFood energy requirements for humans equate conceptually most closely with estimates \nof metabolisable energy [16], which is the energy that can be delivered by food minus \nthe energy used for digestion.    This daily value, which is equivalent to 2.65 kWh per \nperson, included household wastage which was assumed to be about 10%.  Pimental and \nPimental [17] in the United States considered a daily diet equivalent to 3533 kcal (4.1 \nkWh), which was considered to be 1000 kcal above what was needed.  Alexandratos et \nal. [18] using values from national food accounts rather than household usage, estimated \nthat daily food use per person in industrial countries was equivalent to 3446 kcal (4.0 \nkWh) in 1999-2001.   \n \nTable 5.

Using \nthese values, the production of the typical range of  animal products consumed in the \nUK requires 2.84 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of grass and 2.80 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of other animal feed (5.64 \n  \n \nkWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n in total) (Fig 2).  This represents three-quarters of a combined food and feed \nrequirement of 7.57 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.    \n2.5 Wood demand \nIn 2005, the apparent consumption of wood in the UK, primarily in the form of paper, \nwas 44.7 million m\n3\n wood raw material equivalent underbark [19].  Assuming a UK \npopulation of 61.4 million in 2008 [7], this is equivalent to 0.728 m\n3\n of wood per person \nper year.  Assuming a mean dry density for temperate wood of 460 kg m\n-3\n [20], \nmarketable timber with a moisture content (wet basis) of 30% would have a density of \n657 kg m\n-3\n.  Assuming that wood with a moisture content of 30% has an energy value \nof 12.1 MJ kg\n-1 \n[21], this is equivalent to 4.4 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n (Figure 2). \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Total (dotted area) and the 2020 renewable target (in red) demand for electricity, \ntransport fuels, and heat, and the demand (also in red) for food (crops for human \nconsumption), animal feed (crops and grass), and wood. \n \n2.6 Collation of energy data \nThe potential supply of energy within Marston Vale was determined using algorithms \ncombining spatial information with values determined from the literature.  The assumed \nenergy from solar panels on domestic buildings was based on the number of \nhouseholds, an estimate of the area per house, and the assumption that one-eighth of the \nroof area could be used for solar panel installation (Table 6).  A similar estimate was \nderived for commercial buildings.  Estimates for electricity energy from wind were \nbased on the potential number of wind turbine sites beyond specific buffers around \n0\n10\n20\n30\nElectricity Transport Heat Crops for \nhumans\nFeed for \nanimals\nWood\nD\nem\nan\nd\n f\no\nr \nen\ner\ngy\n, \nfo\no\nd\n, f\ne\ned\n \nan\nd\n w\no\no\nd\n (\nkW\nh\n p\n-1\nd\n-1\n)\n  \n \nurban, commercial and woodland areas, and estimates of electricity output for a specific \ntype of wind turbine (Table 7).   \n \n \nTable 6.

A minimum spacing of 335 m of five times a blade diameter of 67 m \nwas assumed [24].   \nc\n  National Energy Foundation [25] quoted by ENTEC [26] estimated that an Enercon E70 (2 MW) wind \nturbine with a hub height of 64 m would generate 3,897,000 kWh per year (capacity factor of 22%) \nassuming a wind speed of 6.1 m s\n-1\n. \nd \nThe Energy Savings Trust [27] recommends that wind turbines should only be located in areas where \nthe windspeed is at least 5 m s\n-1\n using the MCS adjusted NOABL tool.  Within the Marston Vale study \narea, a wind speed of 5 m s\n-1\n or more will only occur in rural areas [28].  The proportion of houses in \nrural areas is assumed to be 3.3% [24] of the existing 10656 dwellings (351 houses).  For the purposes \nof this exercise it is assumed that half of the rural houses could use a pole-mounted turbine (176). \ne\n  Annual mean output for a pole-mounted turbine (non-farm based)  is 11578 kWh [27]. \n  \nEnergy source Output Number \nof \nturbines \nAnnual energy \noutput per turbine \n(kWh) \nEnergy \n(GWh) \nEnergy\na\n \n(kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) \nLarge wind turbine \n(2 MW) \nElectricity 98\nb\n 3,897,000\nc\n 381.9 21.1 \nDomestic pole-\nmounted  \nElectricity 176\nd\n 11578\n e\n 2.0 0.1 \n  \n \nIt was assumed that domestic solar heating panels would be designed to meet the hot \nwater requirement in July (Table 8).  For ground-source heating, the assumption was \nthat ground-source heating could supply 100% of the space heating in new domestic \nbuildings (Table 8).  Estimates were also made of the energy that could be generated \nfrom municipal waste (Table 9).  There was no significant source of hydro-electricity in \nthe area.  At present the only significant renewable energy source used in the Vale is the \nuse of landfill gas to generate electricity.  The active landfill sites at Brogborough, \nL\u201fField Stewartby, and Elstow generated 254 GWh of electricity over 12 months in \n2009\/10 [34] (Table 10).  However this energy is being generated from waste obtained \nfrom an area extending beyond the Marston Vale, and the level of landfill gas will \ndecline over time.  Therefore although the resource is important in the short- to \nmedium-term it is not a long-term renewable energy source. \n \nTable 8.

In July the mean \nhot water user per household is 100 litres and the average temperature rise is 30\u00b0C [29], so assuming a \nspecific heat capacity of water of 4.2 kJ kg\n-1\n K\n-1\n, the annual water heating per house would be 1273 \nkWh.  As a collector can capture annually about 500 kWh m\n-2\n [30], this would require 2.5 m\n2\n of \ncollector. \nc \nMean space heating required for a GB house in 2006 = 11716 kWh [31], and mean total usable floor \narea of a dwelling in England in 2008 was 91.2 m\n2\n [32], therefore average annual space heating \nrequirement is 128.5 kWh m\n-2\n.

For the purpose of this analysis, all of \nthe woodland was assumed to consist of hardwood species.  The arable land was \nassumed to be planted with one of four species: winter wheat, winter barley, winter \noilseed rape, and field beans as a representative spring crop.  Soils data from the \nNational Soil Resources Institute were also used to derive the soil type (coarse, medium, \nfine) and soil depth (100 to 150 cm) across the study area.  A digital terrain map was \nalso used to determine aspect and thereby the amount of solar radiation that a site would \nreceive relative to a horizontal area.  Using the soils data and a climate series of daily \nsolar radiation, temperature and rainfall data from the area, estimates of the yield (dry \nmatter basis) was made for each crop type using the daily time-step Yield-SAFE model \n[35].  Because the effect of aspect on yield was minimal, it was not considered in the \nfull analysis.  The dry matter yield for each crop, as calculated for a fine (e.g. clay) soil \nof 150 cm depth, is presented in Table 11. Although not used in the analysis reported in \nthis paper, the Yield-SAFE model was also parameterised to give estimates of an \nEnergy \nsource \nOutput Quantity of \nwaste \n(t\/person\/year) \nOutput \n(kWh\/t) \nEnergy \n(GWh) \nEnergy \n(kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n)\na \nMunicipal  Electricity 0.53\n b\n 735\nc\n   19.4 1.1 \nwaste Heat 0.53 402\nd\n 10.5 0.6 \nOutput Site Area \n(ha) \nElectricity \ncapacity (MW) \nEnergy \n(GWh) \nEnergy \n(kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n)\na \nElectricity Brogborough 125 28.7\n \n 191.0  \n Stewartby 78 12.5\n \n 58.0  \n Elstow 32 1.8\n \n 4.6  \n Sub-total 261 43.0 253.6 14.0 \n  \n \nequivalent annual yield from short rotation willow coppice, miscanthus, and softwood \nwoodland.  The estimated dry matter yield of 9.7 t ha\n-1\n for miscanthus is similar to the \nmean dry matter yield of 9.6 t ha\n-1\n reported by Ritcher et al. [36].  The dry matter yield \nof 8.2 t ha\n-1\n for willow short rotation coppice (SRC) is broadly similar to the mean dry \nmatter yield of 9.0 t ha\n-1\n reported over two rotations from the UK SRC field trial \nnetwork by Aylott et al. [37].  Typical moisture contents of arable crops, grass and \nwood, as reported in Table 11, were also derived from the literature to allow the \ncalculation of a yield on a fresh weight basis.  In each case, it was assumed that all of \nthe grain, oilseed, or pulse component of each crop would be harvested.  However the \nproportion of straw that could be harvested from wheat, barley, oilseed and beans was \nassumed to be 65%.   The remaining 35% would remain as stubble in the field.   \n \nThe proportion of the total weight of the wheat grain that could be used to produce \nethanol (29%) and distiller grains (10% moisture content) (47%) were derived from \nMortimer et al. [38].  Estimates of the proportion of the weight of the rapeseed crop that \ncould be used to produce biodiesel (35%) and rapemeal (55%) were derived from \nMortimer et al. [39].  The proportion of above-ground tree biomass harvested as timber \nand branches harvested was derived from values cited by Norman et al. [40]. \n \nThe net calorific value of crop and tree products at a specified moisture content (Hu(w); \nMJ kg\n-1\n) depends on their calorific content when dry (Hu(wf); MJ kg\n-1\n) and their moisture \ncontent (w; %) (Equation 1) [45].   \n Hu(w) = [Hu(wf) (100 - w) \u2013 2.44 w ] \/100 Equation 1 \nValues of the net calorific content of crop and tree products when dry were largely \nderived from Kaltschmitt et al. [21] and Fehrenbach et al. [42], and corrected for the \nspecified moisture content using Equation 1.  The calorific value of crops as human feed \nor animal feed is typically expressed in terms of their metabolisable energy.  These \nvalues were largely derived from Noblet et al. [41] and McDonald et al. [43]  corrected \nfor the stated moisture content (Table 11).  The proportion of the energy that can be \nobtained from a biomass source also depends on the conversion process.  For this \nanalysis it was assumed that heat could be obtained at a conversion efficiency of 80% \nand electricity could be obtained at a conversion efficiency of 30%. \n  \n \nTable 11.

Scenario 1, a base-line \nscenario assuming consented development, sought to maximise renewable energy from \nnon-biomass sources whilst maintaining current production of food, feed and wood.  \nScenario 2 includes the same non-biomass renewable energy sources as scenario 1, but \nalthough crop areas were assumed to remain the same, wheat and oilseed surplus to \nhuman food consumption were allocated to the production of transport fuel and animal \nfeed, and the harvested straw of all crops was used for heat.  Use of non-timber wood as \na heating fuel was also assumed.  Scenario 3 focused on growing wheat, a particularly \nhigh yielding crop, on the whole arable and grassland area.  It was assumed that once \nthe human crop food requirement was met, all of the additional wheat grain would be \nconverted to bio-ethanol and all of the harvestable straw would be used for heat. \n \nTable 12. Description of the three energy scenarios \nScenario Description \n1.  Default position: use current cropping pattern and no bio-energy production, \nbut described potential levels of other forms of renewable energy. \n2. Use current cropping pattern, but use all food crops to provide heat and fuel, \nonce demand for human food (but not animal feed) is met.  The non-timber \nbranchwood from woodland would also be used for heat.  Assume potential \nlevels of non-biomass renewables. \n3. Planting the whole arable and grassland area to wheat, and using that to \ngenerate heat and transport fuel, once the demand for human food (but not \nanimal feed) is met.  Branchwood is again used for heat.  Assume potential \nlevels of non-biomass renewables.  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n3. Results \nAs described in the methodology, three scenarios were used to illustrate possible trade-\noffs and synergies between the different sources of renewable energy, and food, feed \nand wood production. \n3.1 Scenario 1: renewables without bioenergy \nThe first scenario assumed that biomass would be used as food for humans, feed for \nanimals (barley grain, barley straw, rape-meal, pulses, grass), and wood for timber.  The \n2020 target renewable electricity supply (4.6 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) could be met with \nphotovoltaic panels on 12.5% of all roofing, seven commercial wind turbines, and \nenergy from waste (Figure 3a).  If 98 commercial wind turbines were installed, then \npotential electricity supply would be 24.2 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n (Figure 3b).  Renewable heating \ntargets (3.7 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) could be met if ground-source heating systems were installed \nwith all new buildings.  Current human food supply was predicted to exceed demand \ndue to the high production of wheat grain (Figure 3).  In practice much of this wheat \nmight be allocated to animal feed, primarily for pigs and poultry.  There would be a \nshort-fall in wood supply and no supply of (transport) biofuel.  \n \n3.2 Scenario 2: Current cropping with bioenergy \nAssuming current cropping practice and allocating 1.9 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of wheat for human \nfood, the oilseed rape and remaining wheat could be used to produce 4.9 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n of \ntransport fuel.  This represents 14% of current transport fuel consumption and exceeds \nthe 10% target of 3.4 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.  Bioethanol production from wheat produces \ndistiller\u201fs grains, and biodiesel from oilseed rape results in rapemeal which can both be \nused as an animal feed.  It is assumed that all of the straw from wheat, barley, oilseed \nrape, and other crops was used exclusively for heating (5.9 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n), plus 0.6 kWh \np\n-1\n d\n-1\n from branches used as woodfuel (Figure 4a).   \n  \n  \n \na) Scenario 1: seven wind turbines \n \nb) Scenario 1: 98 wind turbines \n \n \nFig 3.

Scenario 3 assumed a \nchange in current land use to planting wheat on all arable and grassland areas.  The \nlevels of renewable energy from wind, solar photovoltaics, municipal waste, solar water \nheating, ground source, and water source heating are the same as in Figure 3b.   It was \nanticipated that transport fuel production (bio-ethanol) could reach 11.3 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n \n(33% of current demand).  Assuming that all of the harvestable wheat straw was used \nfor heating, the heat supply could reach 16.3 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n (53% of total demand) (Figure \n4b). \n \n \n \n4. Discussion \n4.1 A framework to promote discussion \nIn recent years, the ongoing energy debate has helped members of the public to \nformulate their opinion on energy futures at the national level, e.g. there is now a very \nstrong public support for renewable energy in principle. However as long as the local \nlevel consequences of national preferences are not well understood, national opinion \npolls will remain a poor basis for strategic planning and policy implementation on the \nground [58]. The analysis presented in this paper helps to visualise the changes in low \ncarbon energy demand and supply that are required at local or regional levels.  The \nenergy unit used in this paper is energy demand and supply per person.  In promoting \ndiscussions with local stakeholders, this approach has proved useful by creating a \ntangible \u201chuman-sized\u201d measure which provides scope for a locally grounded and \nequity-focused discussion.  It also allows individuals within a local area to examine if, \ngiven their level of energy, food and wood consumption and the renewable energy \npotential of their area, they are doing or accepting \u201etheir bit\u201f with respect to the uptake \nof renewable energy.  Within this analysis we have used the units of kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.  \nAlthough kWh is not a standard SI unit, it is the unit by which people in the UK pay for \nelectricity and gas.  It may prove useful, in terms of improving energy literacy and for \nease of comparison, if in the future petrol and diesel prices could also be expressed in \nterms of kWh.  Similarly it would be useful if new vehicles were able to indicate their \nfuel use in terms of kWh in addition to miles per gallon or kilometres per litre.  The \n  \n \nrecognition of such a unit will also become greater with the introduction of electric \nvehicles.  \n4.2 Reducing the demand for energy \nA useful feature of the framework used in this paper, is that the demand for energy, \nfood, feed and wood is described in absolute terms against the potential local supply.  \nCurrent targets such as achieving a certain proportion of energy supply can draw one\u201fs \nfocus away from the possibility of reducing demand as a method of achieving a balance \nbetween demand and supply.  As illustrated in Table 4, in 2009 per capita energy use in \nthe UK was equivalent to about 80 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.   The UK government has predicted [2] \nthat UK energy use should be 144100 kilotonnes of oil equivalent in 2020.   Because the \nUK population is predicted to increase (+8%) from 61.4 million in 2008 to about 66.9 \nmillion in 2021 [46], the prediction for 2020 is equivalent to a per capita energy use of \n68 kWh d\n-1\n.  This is the same value that McKay [9] proposed would be possible for \n2050.  Reaching this value will require a 20% reduction in energy use per person over \nthe next nine years.  This can partly be achieved by reducing the demand for heating \n(which accounts for about a third of UK energy use) for example through roof, window \nand wall insulation.  Other options include improvements in lighting efficiency, \nimproved building energy management systems, and new regulations for new buildings \n[47].  However it is important to realise that the above value relates only to energy use \nwithin the UK.  It does not include the embedded energy of items produced in other \ncountries which are then imported into the UK [48].  Whilst moving energy intensive \nprocesses outside of the UK is one method of reducing UK energy consumption, it does \nnot reduce energy consumption at a global level.  With this qualification, the framework \npresented in this paper provides a mechanism by which options which reduce energy \ndemand can be compared directly with options to increase supply.  \n4.3 Reducing the demand for food and feed \nThe framework also provides a per-capita estimate of the demand for food and animal \nfeed.  Two key areas for reducing these are reducing food waste and reducing the \nconsumption of animal-based products.  The values used to derive the requirement for \nhuman food (Table 5) assumed a 10% level of waste [15].   However WRAP [49] \nsuggest that the proportion of the total weight of food wasted at a household level is \n22% of which 63% (14% of the total weight) is avoidable.  Changes in behaviour and \n  \n \nnew technologies that can reduce food waste are obviously important.  The results \npresented in Table 5 suggest that delivering our food energy requirements in terms of \nanimal products typically requires about 7.8 kWh of plant product energy for every 1 \nkWh of animal product energy.  Hence initiatives to i) improve the efficiency of animal \nproduction, and ii) reduce the demand for meat and milk-based products could \nsubstantially reduce the demand for animal feed.    \n \n4.4 Level of wood self-sufficiency \nThe proportion of the land area covered by wood in the Marston Vale (8%) is about \n68% of the UK average (11.7%).  Even so, assuming typical rates of annual wood \nproduction per hectare, the analysis showed that the Marston Vale was only able to \nsupply 22% of its wood requirements.  The framework therefore highlights the low \nlevel of self-sufficiency and the dominance of imported wood within the UK.  In 2005, \nthe UK imported about 68% of the wood (sawnwood, wood-based panels, paper and \npaperboard) that it consumed [19].  Because about 60% of the consumption was related \nto paper manufacture, reduced and more efficient use of paper could produce significant \nbenefits.   \n4.5 Relative magnitude of the demand for energy and food \nDescribing energy and food on a common scale highlights that the demand for delivered \nenergy (currently 80 kWh d\n-1\n p\n-1\n) is an order of magnitude greater than our demand for \nfood and feed (7.5 kWh d\n-1\n p\n-1\n).  It is also six-times greater than the current supply of \nfood and feed (13.6 kWh d\n-1\n p\n-1\n) from the Marston Vale, which has a population density \nmidway between that for the UK and England (Table 13).  This difference highlights the \nmajor limitations in using biomass production within the UK to address issues of energy \nsecurity particularly when high food prices are a concern for many.   Even if the total \narable and grassland area was planted to a highly productive crop like wheat, the \nMarston Vale could only supply 11 kWh d\n-1\n p\n-1\n (33%) of the current demand for \ntransport fuel, and 16 kWh d\n-1\n p\n-1\n (53%) of the demand for heat energy.  Moreover this \nis only achievable by annually using all of the harvested straw for heating, and in the \nmedium- to long-term this will lead to reduced soil organic matter levels and reduced \nyields.   \n \n  \n  \n \nTable 13.

The chemical energy embedded in fuels is considered to have a high \nthermodynamic quality and it can be stored until required.  Electricity also has a high \nthermodynamic quality but it is currently difficult to store; conversely heat energy is \nconsidered to have a low thermodynamic quality and whilst it can be stored for a certain \nperiod of time (e.g. in insulated hot water tanks), it is difficult to transport. However \nwhere it can be used, the efficiency of obtaining heat from a fuel (80%) is substantially \nhigher than that for electricity (30%).  In practice it is possible to use a combined heat \nand power (CHP) plant to use the heat at the same time as generating electricity.  \nHowever the success of such systems typically requires enterprises close to the power-\nplant which can benefit from a year-round supply of heat.   \n \n4.7 Difficulty in producing transport fuel \nScenario 3 shows that the Marston Vale (with a population density of 3.1 people ha\n-1\n) \ncould only supply 33% of the current demand for transport fuel (34 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n), even if \nall of the arable and grassland area was planted to wheat.  By contrast, assuming a high \nlevel of wind turbines or the short- to medium-term production of electricity from \nlandfill gas, there appears to be potential to increase renewable electricity production.  \n  \n \nThis analysis would support the observation made by others [9] that transport will have \nto become increasingly electricity-based within a low carbon economy.   \n \n4.8 Electricity generation \nThe calculations show that within the Marston Vale, wind seems to offer the greatest \npotential for renewable electricity generation.  Although there would be landscape \nimpacts, the construction of 98 wind turbines, which would cover about 7% of the area, \nwas estimated to produce the equivalent of 21 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.  This is similar to the value \nof 20 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n, calculated by MacKay [9] for onshore wind turbines covering 10% of \nthe UK.  In this analysis we have only focussed on terrestrial sources, but many studies \nhave also placed emphasis on off-shore wind.  For example the Centre for Alternative \nTechnology [51] in their Zero Carbon Britain 2020 scenario assumed that 52% of the \nindigenous UK energy production would come from off-shore wind.  However even \nwith a countrywide network, the temporal variability in wind speeds means that \nalternative methods of producing electricity, storing energy and managing energy \ndemand are still required.  \n \nThe assumed annual electrical energy yield from solar photovoltaics of 117 kWh m\n-2\n \nappears to be at the top end of outputs reported from currently installed systems.  For \nexample Tovey and Turner [52] report an output of 74 kWh m\n-2\n for a roof-mounted \nmono-crystalline system in Eastern England.  Our analysis shows the limited potential \nof solar photovoltaics (1.6 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) if they are limited to only one-eighth of the area \nof domestic housing (5 m\n2\n of panel per person).  MacKay [9] proposed a potential \noutput from photovoltaics of 5 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n, but this was based on the equivalent of 10 \nm\n2\n of photovoltaic panels per person.   Although not considered in this paper, there is \nalso the potential possibility of the creation of solar farms. \n \n4.9 Heating \nThe value estimated for solar water heating (1.4 kWh d\n-1\n) from a 1 m\n2\n panel is similar to \nthe value of 3.8 kWh d\n-1\n for a 3 m\n2\n panel reported by MacKay [9].  However whereas \nwe have assumed only 1 m\n2\n of solar heating panel per person, MacKay assumed that \neach person could install 10 m\n2\n of panels (13 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n).  The lower estimate \npresented here seems to be closer to the current practice of installing systems that match \n  \n \nwater heating requirements during the summer.  Because of the difficulty in installing \nground-source heating in existing buildings, ground-source heating was only assumed in \nnew properties.  In an area such as the Marston Vale where substantial levels of new \nhousing are planned, such heating could be significant (6.5 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n) (Table 8).  \nHowever this output also requires an electrical input for pumping equivalent to 1.8 kWh \np\n-1\n d\n-1\n.  In order to maximise the energy gains from the system, it is desirable that the \nelectricity used to drive the pump is derived from a non-biomass source.  \n4.10 Landfill energy \nIn the three scenarios, energy derived from landfill gas was ignored. Landfill in the \nMarston Vale is currently assumed to be contributing electricity equivalent to 14 kWh p\n-\n1\n d\n-1\n; at present there is minimal use of the heat generated.  Assuming that it was \npossible to use the landfill gas for combined heat and power generation (e.g. by running \nlow-pressure gas pipes from the landfill site to built up areas), then the landfill gas \ncould generate about 23 kWh p\n-1\n d\n-1\n.   Over the short-term this could be a very \nsignificant energy source equivalent to nearly all of the predicted local demand for \nelectricity and most of the heat.  However over the long-term the energy produced will \ndecrease as landfill gas yields decline; though the rate of the reduction is difficult to \ndetermine.  Although landfill gas is an important source of renewable energy in the UK, \nits particular prominence in the study area is untypical for the UK as a whole, being a \nresult of local clay geology, the availability of large pits associated with brick \nmanufacturing, and proximity to large population centres such as London. \n4.11 Greenhouse gas savings \nThe presumption in this paper is that the renewable energies described result in lower \nnet greenhouse gas emissions than the extraction and use of fossil fuels.  Even amongst \nfossil fuels, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per energy output depends on both \nthe fuel source and the type of energy delivered [50].  For example the supply of 1 kWh \nof electricity results in 882 g CO2 if produced from coal and 376 g CO2 if produced \nfrom gas [53].   These are similar to values of 945 and 424 g CO2 kWh\n-1\n for electricity \nproduction from coal and gas respectively as reported by Cannell [54].  Assuming that \nthe carbon contained in the biomass would not have been sequestered in the absence of \nharvesting that crop, then the predicted emission from an electrical power plant using \nbiomass has been estimated to be 44 g CO2 kWh\n-1\n [54].   This may be the case for \n  \n \nsustainable biomass removal from a mature forest.  However in other situations the \nharvesting of biomass may simply reduce the natural sequestration of carbon. \n \nThe extraction and use of petrol and diesel have been estimated to result in the emission \nof 293-315 g CO2 equivalent kWh\n-1\n [55].  By contrast net greenhouse emissions for the \nproduction of bioethanol from wheat range from 42 to 228 g CO2 equivalent kWh\n-1\n, and \nthat for biodiesel from oilseed rape ranges from -20  to 166 g CO2 equivalent kWh\n-1\n \n[55].  These values represent net greenhouse gas savings of between 22 and 106% \ndepending on the use of the co-products, soil type, and previous land use.  Converting \narable land to perennial crops such as woodland, short rotation coppice, miscanthus or \ngrass, is usually beneficial in reducing the oxidation of soil carbon [56].  By contrast, \nconverting grasslands and forests into cultivated arable land will reduce the net \ngreenhouse gas emission benefits.  The reduction of soil carbon caused by removing \nstraw, rather than incorporating into the soil, will also create environmental costs if \nstraw is used as an energy source.  The scenarios described in this paper need to be \nanalysed further to predict their effect on net greenhouse gas emissions. \n4.12 Ecosystem services \nEffects of renewable energy supply on ecosystem services go beyond the three \nprovisioning services of food, feed and wood considered here.  Increased biomass fuel \nproduction from perennial crops can lead to increased competition for water supply, \nwhilst having positive effects on water quality.  There are also effects on other \necosystem services such as soil carbon, habitat creation, and cultural services including \nrecreational opportunities.  Such services are also important for human well-being and \nthe impacts of land-based renewables on such services, need to be better understood as \nwell as taken into consideration in existing impact assessment procedures such as EIA \n[57]. \n5. Conclusions \nEnergy policy was traditionally set at the national level, whilst energy consumption was \nstudied for individual households. The framework used in this paper enables the \ndevelopment of energy scenarios at any intermediate geographical scale between the \nnational level and the household level, linking local production potential with the local \nlevel of consumption, and exploring the synergies and trade-offs between local \n  \n \nrenewable energy production on the one hand and the production of other land-based \ncommodities on the other.  By expressing the demand and supply of energy (electricity, \ntransport and heat), food, animal feed and wood in a common per capita unit, this \nframework can be used to examine how a range of national policies - on energy, \nhousing, agriculture, land use - could be implemented in a balanced and integrated way \nat the local level. The development of scenarios to explore what can be done locally, \ncan help to inform local planning decisions and facilitate public engagement in the \n(otherwise rather abstract) energy debate on a more concrete and contextualised basis. \nTo the extent that the population density in the Marston Vale is similar to that in the \nUK, the study also serves as a microcosm of the UK energy landscape.  Finally, the \nframework lends itself for further extensions, e.g. to compare the options in terms of net \ngreenhouse gas emissions, finance, and public perceptions.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe research described was funded by a Natural Environment Research Council \n(NERC) Grant (reference NE\/H010432\/1).
