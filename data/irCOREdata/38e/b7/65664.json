TMS was delivered over right posterior parietal \ncortex (PPC) or right lateral occipital (LO) cortex, regions known to have visuo-\nspatial and object processing properties respectively. LO but not PPC stimulation had \na significant effect on reaction time when subjects were asked to make a \ndiscrimination of relative shape. PPC stimulation had a significant effect when \nsubjects were asked to discriminate relative position of the same shapes.  Stimulation \nof LO also lengthened reaction times on the position task. There were no effects of \nstimulation at either site on colour discrimination. Results are discussed within the \nframework of how the dorsal stream and ventral stream are dissociated following their \ndamage in neurological patients and possible ways in which they may interact in the \nnormal brain. \n \n \n \nKeywords: Ventral Stream, Dorsal Stream, visual discrimination, transcranial \nmagnetic stimulation. \n \n 2\n 3\nIntroduction \nNeurological patients with dorsolateral parietal damage and classical left hemineglect \nalso have deficits in processing line bisection or landmark tasks (Harvey et al., 1995). \nHowever, if they are asked to point to the middle of the screen or a shape, they can do \nthis accurately, presumably by making a discrimination based on shape rather than \nspatial extent and thereby recruiting their undamaged ventral stream (Bartelomeo et \nal., 2003), even though there is a visuomotor component to the task which may recruit \ndorsal function (Goodale & Milner 1992). The following study seeks to investigate \nthe difference, if any, between the dorsal and ventral streams in how they process \nspace, items in space, and colour.  \n \nMuch of the recent research investigating the differential function of the dorsal and \nventral streams has focussed on the influential Goodale and Milner \u201cwhat and how\u201d \nmodel (1992). This theory was formulated in part by observations made in two \nneuropsychological conditions, optic ataxia and visual form agnosia. It was revealed \nthat patients with damage to the ventral and ventro-lateral occipito-temporal regions \ncould no longer recognise objects or estimate their size or shape but could physically \nmanipulate them correctly (Milner et al., 1991; Carey et al., 1996). On the other hand, \npatients with dorsal damage centred on the angular and supramarginal gyri of the \nposterior parietal cortex demonstrate severe visuomotor deficits, dissociated from \ntheir preserved ability to recognise objects and perceive their shape and size etc. \n(Milner et al., 2001, Jeannerod et al., 1994; Perenin and Vighetto, 1988). \n \nThe model of Goodale and Milner is a modification of the original two streams \nhypothesis of Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982), which established a distinction \nbetween \u201cwhat and where\u201d pathways for the ventral and dorsal streams respectively. \nThere has been intensive subsequent investigation into interactions between \u201cwhat \nand where\u201d and \u201cwhat and how\u201d and the anatomical overlap of these systems as \nshown by neuroimaging techniques, which have been very successful in confirming \nthe underlying basis of functional dissociations seen in neuropsychology. (Faillenot et \nal., 1997; James et al., 2003). These investigations indicate that object-oriented action \nand object recognition activate a common posterior parietal area. Hence, regardless of \nthe task required, some aspects of object perception appear to be involved in the \nanalysis of object properties. As Creem & Proffitt (2001) point out, this type of object \n 3\n 4\nanalysis appears to be distinct from an analysis performed in the ventral temporal and \nlateral-occipital cortex and is more consistent with theories that there is some object-\nbased analysis in the dorsal stream (Jeannerod, 1997; Milner & Goodale, 1995; \nCreem-Regehr & Lee, 2005).   \n \nThe present study attempts to delineate the perceptual dissociation of these two \nstreams using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and three simple visual tasks \ninvolving a spatial, colour and form discrimination. TMS provides a means of briefly \ndisrupting neural functioning, allowing us to probe the necessity of the region of \ninterest in the processing of the task. As previously discussed, neuropsychology and \nneuroimaging have identified many areas of specialisation interacting in broad \nstreams of processing in these domains. However, our aim is to investigate the \ndifferential involvement of two areas in these three tasks: right lateral-occipital area \n(LO) known to be an important region in object recognition in the ventral stream \n(Ferber et al, 2005, Avidan et al., 2003, Lerner et al., 2002; Kourtzi & Kanwisher, \n2001) and an area of right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) known from many studies to \nhave visuospatial specialisation (Avidan at al., 2003, Ellison et al., 2003; Bjoertomt et \nal., 2002). As these areas are part of the established processing streams, if either is \ninvolved in the processing of a task, a deficit in performance should be demonstrated \nfollowing disruption by TMS. \n \nIt could be predicted that as spatial considerations are important in the perception of \nshape, right dorsal PPC will be just as involved as ventral LO in the shape task. \nEqually, as the task is presented in distributed space, right PPC may have a role on \nthese grounds. Another factor that may influence involvement of PPC in this task is \nthe nature of the performance indicator. Subjects are asked to press a button related to \nwhich item matches a foveally fixated comparison item, which is an action based on \nperception. If these two acts (one perceptual, one motor) are in any way linked, one \nwould expect PPC involvement in all tasks. However, due to the regional spatial \nspecificity of TMS, if LO is the only critical area involved in the processing of this \ntask, then a dissociation between involvement of LO and PPC would be expected.  \n \nThe other two tasks involve a visuospatial allocentric discrimination (relative position \nor distance) and a colour matching task. One would predict little involvement of the \n 4\n 5\nLO site in the distance discrimination and little involvement of PPC in the colour task \n(unless the action to be taken upon this discrimination drives PPC involvement in  \naccordance with the Goodale and Milner (1995) model). Colour recognition and \nnaming in visual-form agnosia patients is usually spared (Aglioti et al., 1999; Milner \n& Heywood,1989) allowing patients the ability to use this information for implicit \nperception of shape (Kentridge, Heywood & Milner 2004). However, we are \nparticularly interested in the possible role of LO in the use of colour information for \ndiscrimination in normal neural processes.  \n \nMethods \nSubjects \nEight healthy subjects, aged 19-23, with normal or corrected to normal vision (all \nright handed; 4 female, 4 male), participated in all three tasks. Subjects gave their \nsigned informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the \napproval of Durham University Ethics Advisory Committee, and could leave the \nexperiment at any point. Subject selection complied with current guidelines for rTMS \nresearch (Wassermann, 1998).  \n \nStimuli \nAll stimuli were presented on a 32cm x 24cm VDU driven by a Pentium-4 PC \nprogrammed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc). Subjects were seated  57.5 \ncm away from the screen with the centre of the screen at eye level. The subjects\u2019 head \nand trunk sagittal midline was aligned with the centre of the screen, and head position \nwas controlled by a chinrest. Eye movements and eye blinks were not continuously \nmonitored, given our earlier experiments in which TMS in these regions did not affect \neither of them. Also, direct observations by the experimenters, which readily reveals \nblinks and saccades during the half second period of stimulus presentation and TMS, \nshowed no such effects. \n \nVisual Tasks \nThree visual tasks were used (see Figure 1). The threshold for 80 per cent correct \nperformance in each task had first to be determined. In all tasks one item was \npresented in the centre of the screen with two items presented at a lateral, left,  \neccentricity, one either side of the horizontal midline as detailed below (see Figure 1). \n 5\n 6\nIn each task, every trial began with 500ms central fixation cross (0.5\u00ba x 0.5\u00ba) after \nwhich the three stimuli were presented for 500ms, one of them replacing the fixation \ncross. The background colour was a uniform grey with a luminance of 30cd\/m2. There \nwas a 4 second interval between trials. The difficulty of the task was titrated by \nmaking it progressively more or less difficult according to the following rule. \nDifficulty was modulated after each set of five trials. After five consecutive correct \nresponses difficulty was increased by one step (steps are described in detail below in \nthe description of each task). If two or more incorrect responses out of five were \nmade, the difficulty was decreased by one step. Performance was deemed stable when \nperformance reached 80% correct (4 out of five) in two subsequent sets.  \n \nDistance Task:   \nStimuli were presented as green (11 cd\/m2) squares of 1\u00ba x 1\u00ba with one square \npresented in the centre of the screen. The other two items were presented 5\u00ba to the left \nof the vertical midline. One square (either the top or the bottom) was always 3\u00ba above \nor below the horizontal midline. The other square was initially presented at a vertical \neccentricity of 4 degrees from the horizontal meridian and progressively it approached \nit in 0.2\u00ba steps until the threshold for 80% correct was reached. The experimental \nvalue of the distance of the furthest object from the centre was then set at 0.2\u00ba more \nthan the threshold value found. The subject was asked to respond by indicating which \nitem was closest to the item in the centre by pressing the bottom button on a keypad if \nthe bottom item was closest and the top button if it was the top item. The top square \nwas the closer item in 50% of trials, at random. See Figure 1. \n \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nShape task: \nTwo shape sets comprised this task. The first set used an outlined central square (1\u00ba x \n1\u00ba) and in the other set the central shape was an outlined oblong of equal area, \nsubtending 1.47\u00ba x 0.69\u00ba. Stimuli were presented in the same format as the distance \ntask but position was fixed 5 degrees to the left of the vertical midline and 4\u00ba either \nside of the horizontal midline (see Figure 1). The non-identical shape differed from \nthe central shape by 0.5\u00ba in the x and y axis (in order to maintain equal area) initially. \nIt approached the shape of the central item in 0.1 degree steps until threshold was \n 6\n 7\nreached at 80% correct. On half of the trials, at random, the central shape was the \nsquare and on the other half it was the oblong. The experimental value of the shape \ndifferent from that in the centre was then set at 0.1\u00ba larger than the threshold value \nfound. The subject was asked to respond by indicating which item was the same shape \nas the item in the centre by pressing the bottom button on a keypad if the bottom item \nwas identical and the top button if it was the top item. The top item was the same \nshape in 50% of trials (see Figure 1). \n \nColour task: \nAll three items used in this task were a coloured square subtending 1\u00ba x 1\u00ba. Stimuli \nwere presented in the same manner as the shape task with position of squares fixed 5\u00ba \nto the left of the vertical midline and 4 degrees either side of the horizontal midline \n(see Figure 1). Two colour sets were used, in the first the central colour was bluish (x \n= .208, y = .265) and in the second set was purple (x = .173, y = .084). Non-identical \ncolours differed from the central colour in increasingly small steps, as shown in \nFigure 2, until threshold was reached at 80% correct.  \n \nFIGURE 2 about here \n \nHalf the trials, at random, used the first colour set with the other half comprising the \nsecond colour set. The experimental value of the colour that differed from that in the \ncentre was then set at one step higher than the threshold value found. The colours in \neach set were not photometrically isoluminant (which is difficult to achieve with E-\nprime) but at threshold performance the luminance difference between the sample and \nthe odd-one-out was just below 10 per cent for the blues and just above for the \npurples. Given the notorious difficulty of judging the relative brightness of different \ncolours and the subsequent statements of all subjects, when asked, that their \njudgments were based on colour, we can be confident that the task was not being \nsolved on the basis of small luminance differences. The subject was asked to respond \nby indicating which item was the same colour as the item in the centre by pressing the \nbottom button on a keypad if the bottom item was identical and the top button if it \nwas the top item. The top item was the same colour in 50% of trials. See Figure 1. \n 7\n 8\n \nTMS \nA Magstim\u2122 SuperRapid machine was used to apply pulses at 10Hz for 500ms at \n65% of the stimulator\u2019s maximum power (i.e. 1.3 Tesla) using a 70mm figure-of-eight \ncoil held in place by the experimenter and placed tangential to the skull, with the \nhandle pointing backward, parallel to the horizontal and the mid-sagittal plane. This \nmagnetic intensity is greater than the threshold intensity required to induce movement \n(over motor cortex) or the perception of phosphenes (over primary visual cortex, V1) \nin all of the subjects but did not produce phosphenes when delivered over LO or PPC. \nThe TMS train of 5 pulses began at stimulus onset in each case. If the experimenter \ndetected any head movement the coil was always repositioned, even if both head and \ncoil probably moved in unison.  \n \nTwo sites of stimulation were used, a right ventral stream site (LO) and a right dorsal \nstream site (PPC). The dorsal site was chosen as an area of posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC) known to be involved in difficult conjunction visual search tasks that engage \ndorsal functions. To this effect it was identified by using a hunting procedure with the \nhard conjunction task, as described in Ashbridge et al. (1997) in which 10 trials of \nsingle-pulse TMS are given to each site in a 3 x 3 grid (each point 1 cm apart) around \na central point 9 cm dorsal to the mastoid-inion and 6cm lateral to the right. The \n\u201chotspot\u201d for activation is denoted by a roughly 100ms increase in reaction time \ncompared to the trials in which no TMS was administered. The position of this area as \nco-registered with cortical position using BrainSight software (Rogue Research\u2122) is \nshown in Figure 1. The ventral site was chosen in relation to area right V5 (generally \ncorresponding to 3cm above the mastoid-inion and 5cm lateral to the right) which was \nprecisely identified by localising the area where a train of TMS pulses (10Hz, 500ms) \nelicited the strongest and most salient moving phosphenes (see Schenk et al., 2005) at \nthe lowest TMS intensity. The ventral site LO was then calculated to be 1-1.5cm \ncaudal on the skull in a direct line towards the inion in accordance with various \nanatomical and functional maps (e.g. van Essen et al., 2001) and co-registration with \nstructural MRI using frameless stereotaxy (BrainSight\u2122). This area can be seen to \ncorrespond well with lateral occipital cortex (LO) (see Figure 1). \n \n 8\n 9\nTrials were administered in six blocks of 20 trials (per task) each randomised across \nsubjects to minimise either order or practice effects; two blocks with TMS over PPC \non each trial, two blocks with TMS over LO on each trial and two blocks of sham \nTMS. In sham TMS, a non-discharging coil was placed over either the PPC or LO site \nwhilst the discharging coil was placed a few cm above it so that the subjective \nexperience of the noise associated with a TMS pulse was the same as was the tactile \nexperience of a coil placed on the head. However, no effective pulse was administered \nto the brain. The testing session usually lasted no more than 1.5 hours. \n 9\n 10\nResults \nThresholds: \nThe mean threshold achieved across subjects in the distance task was a difference of \n0.43 \u00b1 0.10 degrees for 80% correct. This led to a fixed distance of 0.63 \u00b1 0.10 for the \nfurthest square in the experimental task. In the shape task, performance reached \nthreshold at a 0.12\u00ba \u00b1 0.02\u00ba difference in shape, leading to a fixed 0.21\u00ba \u00b1 0.02\u00ba \ndifference in the experimental session. A threshold difference of 35 \u00b1 5 units was \nachieved in the colour task meaning the difference in colour was fixed at 52.5 \u00b1 3.66 \nunits in the experimental task. Although the colours were not initially isoluminant, the \nfinal colours determined by prior titration differed only slightly in luminance. Also, \nall subjects confirmed that their judgement was based on the colour of the targets. \nAcross all three tasks the chosen stimulus values corresponded to about 90% correct \nin each subject to maximise the possible effect of TMS on reaction time in each task \nwithout encountering the problem of ceiling effects. \n \nEffect of TMS: \nA two factor (Task [distance, shape, colour] x TMS [LO, PPC, sham]) ANOVA \nrevealed a main effect of task (F(2, 14) = 5.183, p = 0.021) and TMS (F(2, 14) = 20.203, p \n< 0.001) and a significant interaction between task and TMS (F(4, 28) = 5.510, p = \n0.002). A corrected \u03b1 of 0.0025 was used in the post-hoc Bonferroni tests, reflecting \nthe two comparisons done within each task (sham v PPC and sham v LO). These \nrevealed significant differences between sham and LO TMS for the shape task (t = -\n4.009, df = 7, p = 0.005) and between sham and PPC TMS for the distance task (t = -\n4.241, df = 7, p = 0.004) . TMS over LO also induced a significant increase in \nreaction time in the distance task (t = -3.371, df = 7, p = 0.012). No significant \ndifferences were seen in the colour task at either site (see Figure 3). \n \nFIGURE 3 about here \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10\n 11\n \n \nDiscussion: \nThe results show that posterior parietal cortex has an influential, possibly vital role in \nthe processing of a task requiring a spatial discrimination (distance task) but not one \nthat requires a discrimination based on either shape or colour features. Conversely, the \nventral stream is clearly involved in the processing of a shape discrimination but, \napparently paradoxically, not colour discrimination.  \n \nWhilst it was not unexpected to demonstrate involvement of right PPC in the \nprocessing of a visuospatial task, the involvement of the ventral stream cannot be \nignored. If LO has a specialisation for perceptual shape as neuropsychological \n(Goodale et al., 1994) and functional neuroimaging (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2001, \nMalach et al., 1995) results indicate, then it is reasonable to assume that some shape \nbased processing must contribute to how the brain computes the distance \ndiscrimination. This reinforces the dissociation reported by Barolomeo and colleagues \n(2003) that when patients with neglect are asked to point to the middle of a screen or \nshape they are unimpaired, presumably as a result of the functional processing of \nshape in their intact ventral stream. Taken together, these findings evince the \ncontribution of shape processing to the processing of space. \n \nOur tasks did not require visuomotor manipulation of the visual target, unlike many of \nthe neuropsychological dissociation studies of dorsal and ventral streams  (Milner et \nal, 1991; Goodale et al, 1994). However they did require a motor action based on a \ncognitive perceptual decision. Nonetheless, this motor component was not sufficient  \nto involve PPC in the shape task, and so it is reasonable to assume that the \ninvolvement of this region in the distance task was visuospatial in nature. Indeed, as \nGrafton et al. (1992) suggested, there may be functionally distinct portions of the \nsuperior posterior parietal lobe that are necessary for integrating visual cues with \nmovement selection and that it is damage to these regions that causes the visuomotor \nproblems seen in parietal patients with neglect. In contrast, the inferior parietal lobule \nmay be more responsible for directed visual attention and may be more involved in \n\u201cwhere\u201d functions. Due to the focal nature of TMS disruption, these functions can be \nteased apart for each stimulated site.  \n 11\n 12\n \nOur results show that there are regionally separable processes in the brain for shape \nbased discrimination and a less clear dissociation for a spatial discrimination. \nFollowing a neuroimaging study, Fink et al., (1997) suggested that \u201cobject-based and \nspace-based attention share common neural mechanisms in the parietal lobe\u201d. If this \nwere the case, we should have seen involvement of right PPC in both the object and \nspatial discriminations, which we did not. Instead, the current disruption study \nsuggests that spatial discrimination recruits a mechanism used in object processing \nbut not vice-versa. Furthermore, these mechanisms occur in disparate regions of \ncortex, namely right PPC and LO. Future experiments should investigate how and \nwhat these areas contribute to spatial processing perhaps by looking at the timing of \ntheir involvement. Any differences uncovered here might shed some light on this \nsurprising result and go some way to investigating how PPC and LO work together in \nthe processing of this task.  \n \nStimulation of neither PPC nor LO had an effect on the processing of the colour task. \nAlthough it could be argued that subjects were solving the colour task on the basis of \nsmall unavoidable luminance differences between the colours, as mentioned under \nmethods, this cannot be correct because PPC stimulation should have disrupted such \nluminance judgements. The simplest explanation is that it is another area, such as \nventro-medial human V4, which is the most indispensable area for the processing of \ncolour, although lesions to area V4 alone in monkeys have only slight effects on \ncolour discrimination and are certainly not sufficient to produce achromatopsia \n(Cowey & Heywood, 1995). It would seem that co-operation between areas is \nrequired to process colour fully, both cortically and sub-cortically (Cowey & \nHeywood, 1995; Heywood et al., 1992; Zeki & Marini, 1998; Bartels & Zeki, 2000) \nHowever, although patients with visual shape agnosia caused by damage to the \nventral stream are usually unimpaired in colour naming and recognition (Aglioti et al., \n1999; Milner & Heywood 1989), we were interested in the role of LO in the use of \ncolour information for discrimination in normal neural processes. However, such an \ninvolvement may only be uncovered if the shape discrimination is made to be \ncontingent upon colour discrimination.  \nAll the effects reported here involved the lengthening of reaction times; percentage \ncorrect performance was not altered. We are now exploring a variety of other displays \n 12\n 13\ntogether with briefer stimulus presentations in order to determine whether \nperformance as well as reaction time can be selectively impaired. \n \n \n 13\n 14\n \nReferences \nAglioti S, Bricolo E, Cantagallo A, Berlucchi G.
