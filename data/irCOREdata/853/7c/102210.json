That the\ncreator and performers (Lloyd Newson and\ncollaborators in the company DV8) have a\nnarrative position is perhaps as obvious as the\nnarrative position of the writer of this article.\nBut there are also many other authorial and\nancestral dances and sonorities that set the\ncontext. These are the dancescapes and sound-\nscapes of the last five centuries in Christian-\nized countries.2\nThere are the narratives that we inherit and\nabsorb often without directly recognizing\nthem, from the body of scholarly writing in\ndance and physical theatre. They are evident\nin discourses found in a range of publications\nand images, from popular journalism to\nbooks and journals. The voices that are\naudible in Strange Fish, a physical theatre\nwork first shown in 1992 and subsequently\nreworked for video in 1994, are many and\nvaried. Newson\u2019s intentions and practices\ndid not coincide happily with many of the\nexisting dance voices \u2013 primarily those of ab-\nstract modern dance inherited from the US \u2013\nand I articulate these positions in the first\npart of the paper.\nI make use in particular of the idea of \u2018an-\ncestral scholarly narratives\u2019 of intertextual\ntheory to construct an open-ended argument\ntracing some of the layers of analysis the\nwork invites. Strange Fish, I argue, invites the\nreader to produce multiple traces, through\nthe process of setting in play different texts\nand intertexts. As the reader adopts different\npositions, so different texts come into focus.\nExpressed in another way, different \u2018voices\u2019\nsing at different moments. In addition to the\nusefulness of the idea of \u2018voice\u2019 in tracing\nintertextual threads, the presence of actual and\nethereal voices in Strange Fish give this theme\nparticular poignancy.3\nPre-Birth Voices of Newson and DV8\nLloyd Newson\u2019s ancestral voices are found\nin the white, American\/Australian\/European\nnexus of 1970s youth culture, in theatre\ndance, and in popular physical arts.

These works are generally created with performers through workshop\nprocesses and collaboratively with composers. London\u2019s experimental dance and theatre\nscenes in the 1980s and early 1990s provided a challenging context for Lloyd Newson\u2019s\nearly creative endeavours. Here, Janet Lansdale takes one work, Strange Fish, as the\nlocus of her discussion on narrative positions in relation to dominant forms of modern\ndance and issues of sexuality, homophobia, and politics within physical theatre. She\nconceptualizes and contextualizes \u2018voices\u2019 as \u2018authorial\u2019 and \u2018ancestral\u2019, and traces their\nmanifestation in readings of the work. Complementary and sometimes competing voices\nfrom author, text, reader, and cultural history are articulated through a range of intertextual\nperspectives. This is the second in a series of articles on this work.1 Janet Lansdale is\nDistinguished Professor in Dance Studies at the University of Surrey, where she was\nHead of Department, and later Head of the School of Performing Arts. She is the author\nand editor of four books on dance theory, history, and analysis, the most recent being\nDancing Texts: Intertextuality in Interpretation (1999).\nundergraduate and postgraduate levels, he\ndanced in the Modern Dance Ensemble, an\namateur group with release and improvis-\nation interests. Newson came to the UK in\n1980, studied briefly at the London School of\nContemporary Dance, and joined Extempo-\nrary Dance Theatre (EDT) in 1981, producing\nan early company piece alongside another\nnewly emerging (and equally controversial)\nchoreographer, Michael Clark.4 At that time,\nEmilyn Claid, the Director of EDT, was also\ncommissioning works from other new dance\nchoreographers such as Jackie Lansley, for\nSpeaking Part (1981), and Fergus Early, for\nNapoli (1982). While Newson might have\nbeen impatient to move on, he was already in\nthe only mainstream company in the UK with\nexperimental ambitions, which he acknow-\nledges in interview with Andy Solway.5\nNewson started his own group, DV8\n(deviate) Physical Theatre in 1986, as an\nindependent collective. Among its stated aims\nwas \u2018to re-invest meaning in dance\u2019, clearly\nimplying that modern dance had lost its way\nand no longer dealt with meaning. Newson\u2019s\nextension of early twentieth-century Expres-\nsionist theatre and dance movements is\npeculiarly European in character, in its focus\non the intensity of emotion and on the use of\nimages, words, and movement, separately\nand together, treating personal, social, and\npolitically intense subject matter. This trend\nreverberated further than physical theatre to\nclassical ballet and modern dance, where it is\nembodied in expressionistic treatments of\ntraditional subject matter in these forms, too,\nalthough not to the same extent and in very\ndifferent movement vocabularies.6\nDancing Voices of the 1980s\nBy the 1980s and 1990s there existed compet-\ning, even mutually exclusive, positions on\nwhat was perceived to be \u2018new\u2019 and of value\nin the contemporary dance scene. I articulate\nthese voices through a comparison of critical\nviews to reveal shifting genre and style\nboundaries. A useful site is found in annual\nfestivals such as those of Dance Umbrella\nand Spring Loaded (both London events),\nwhich present a large amount of new work.\nThe group of articles referred to below reflect\na ten-year shift across the British dance scene.\nFiona Burnside identifies what she calls\n\u2018original\u2019 and \u2018mature\u2019 voices in 1980s\u20131990s\nBritish \u2018contemporary dance\u2019 in the work of\nRichard Alston, Laurie Booth, Rosemary\nButcher, and Siobhan Davies. Although recog-\nnizing that they do not together make a\n\u2018united school of thought based on a com-\nmon philosophy\u2019, she suggests that they none\nthe less share a \u2018cultural and social heritage\nwhich has influenced their absorption and\ntransformation of contemporary dance\u2019.7 The\nqualities and concerns seen in the \u2018integra-\ntion of the elements of production\u2019 separates\nthese collaborations from the \u2018jarring juxta-\npositions of other European work\u2019. In the\nsame breath, she remarks on the conspicuous\nabsence of the kind of \u2018dramatic narrative . . .\nemotional expression, and sexual relations . . .\nshock tactics . .  . political ideology\u2019 credited\nto Lloyd Newson.\nBurnside sketches the parameters of what\nmight be termed a distinct style, which she\nlikens to \u2018the exposition, modulation, and\nrecapitulation of a musical score\u2019 rather than\nto \u2018Aristotelian cathartic theatre\u2019. To support\nthis argument she states that a degree of\ndedication \u2018to exploring the formal proper-\nties of the dance medium\u2019 is obvious where\n\u2018intellectual pleasure in . . . patterning and\na sensual enjoyment of the smooth textures\nof the movement and the colour range\u2019 are\nmost evident. This was hardly a productive\nstarting place for Lloyd Newson.\nAn \u2018elegant and reticent aesthetic\u2019, but\none based on a wider range of themes and\nmoods, characterizes Siobhan Davies\u2019s \u2018bodies\nin motion\u2019, building a \u2018corporate psyche\u2019\nrather than individual personalities. A \u2018wider\nworld is invoked\u2019 and a \u2018larger canvas of\nhuman suffering\u2019 than (she suggests) Rose-\nmary Butcher ever creates.8 Again, this is\nsome distance in stylistic concerns from\nLloyd Newson\u2019s apparent interests, despite\nshared reference to an external world. Laurie\nBooth, Burnside argues, contrasts most obvi-\nously with the others and, in deriving his\nmovement in part from martial arts, physical\ntheatre, and contact improvisation, sows the\nseeds of shared concerns with Newson.\n118\nBooth, however, unlike Newson, elicits res-\nponse from \u2018the physical embodiment of the\nwork and not through emotional engagement. \nRoughcut, Richard Alston\u2019s work discussed\nby Burnside, is untypical, although sharing\nwith his other works \u2018technically demand-\ning, physical exploration\u2019 which requires\n\u2018swift, clean execution and vital energy\u2019. She\nargues that his work has a greater range of\nreference to narrative elements, represen-\ntation, and literary themes than any of the\nother three choreographers in this group.9\nThis, too, is hardly comfortable artistic com-\npany for Lloyd Newson.\nConstanti provides something of a coun-\nterbalance to Burnside by considering very\ndifferent types of work in the 1987 Spring\nLoaded festival at The Place which, she\nargues, revealed two opposing schools of\nthought, \u2018dance which appears to be based\n(naively?) on \u2018gratuitous pyrotechnics . . .\n[and] the retaliatory movement stemming\nfrom a vigorous personal\/social\/political\nstance\u2019.10\nShe refers to Images and La Bouche\u2019s work\nin terms of \u2018gratuitous pyrotechnics\u2019 and,\nseparately, to the personal stance of Emilyn\nClaid, Liz Aggiss, and DV8. Reluctance to let\n\u2018tragedy become beautiful\u2019 is shared by this\nsecond group, which she describes as em-\nbodying \u2018hard hitting and compulsive\u2019 realism\nand physical\/emotional risk-taking \u2013 a more\nobvious connection for Lloyd Newson. \nUnexpected shifts on the borderlines bet-\nween \u2018witty nonsense\u2019 and \u2018vicious parody\u2019\nmake Lea Anderson\u2019s work for the Chol-\nmondeleys clearly distinctive even while she\nshares some of these features. Her work is\nindividual in its \u2018rich, abstract vocabulary,\nthe secret cues and whispers are built into a\nweird, hermeneutic grid of movement, magi-\ncally sustained by the infernal animation of\nDrostan Madden\u2019s music \u2013 a blend of Velvet\nUnderground, saxophone . . . and accordion\u2019.11\nIn 1996, nearly ten years later, Jann Parry\nreflects on the diversity within \u2018new dance\u2019\nand particularly in cutting-edge work. She\nidentifies a distinctive concern with construct-\ning narrative and a trend towards spectacle\nand theatre, a more comfortable environ-\nment in which Lloyd Newson plays an\nimportant part.12 Parry constructs a number\nof categories and spans a huge field; firstly,\nballet-derived work as in the newly re-formed\nBallet Rambert under Christopher Bruce;\nsecondly, two individuals, Alston and Davies,\nas the creators of modernist, developed ver-\nsions of established contemporary dance\ntechniques. \nEmerging more clearly in her account are\nperformers working with a highly physical\napproach \u2013 sometimes called Eurocrash com-\npanies. Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Wim\nVandekeybus, and Claude Brumachon are\nplaced here, but so, too, are circus-trained\ngroups. She links dancers who use martial\narts, including Laurie Booth and Russell\nMaliphant, as a fourth stream; while a fifth\ncategory, of English Eccentrics, includes \u2018an\nassortment of choreographers whose work is\nhighly idiosyncratic\u2019. Here Parry refers to\nvastly different individuals from Javier de\nFrutos to Julyen Hamilton, including Wayne\nMcGregor, Matthew Hawkins, Yolande Snaith,\nLea Anderson, Liz Aggiss, and Jonathan Bur-\nrows. \u2018Mature performers\u2019, whom she groups\nseparately, include Misha Baryshnikov and\nFergus Early. \nTo this amorphous group of categories,\nshe adds \u2018club and rave culture\u2019 (Bunty\nMatthias), \u2018text-based work\u2019 (Nigel Charnock,\nV-Tol, and Second Stride), \u2018cross-cultural\/\nintercultural groups\u2019 (Vivarta festivals and\nShobana Jeyasingh, Peter Badejo), and finally\n\u2018new technology dance\u2019 (Mark Baldwin).13 So\nthe dance world in which Newson worked\nbetween 1987 and the end of the 1990s offered\nsome compatible voices and a number of\nclearly incompatible ones.\nA Post-Expressionist Narrative\nNewson\u2019s relationship to the ancestral voices\nof the expressionist tradition is revealed in\nhis deep concern with the legibility of dance.\nHis work relies on his collaborators to \u2018reveal\nsomething of their inner selves\u2019, to the\ndegree that the performer may feel \u2018totally\nexposed and vulnerable\u2019.14 He challenges the\nmodernist idea of the construction of emo-\ntional archetypes, aligning himself with post-\nmodernist works in the 1980s which, more\n119\ntypically, draw on autobiography without\nreserve rather than abstracting from it.15\nAmong the traces of expressionism that\nmay not be obviously relevant is Newson\u2019s\ninheritance of an actual European expression-\nist dance movement in his native Australia.\nThis tradition owed its origins to Gertrud\nBodenwieser\u2019s move from Austria in 1938, in\nthe face of difficult political circumstances, to\nthe Southern Hemisphere, where she took\nAusdruckstanz.16 I do not suggest a direct\n\u2018influence\u2019 but rather an atmosphere, a cul-\nture, of which he was a part and whose voices\nare still heard. Newson\u2019s work is much more\nthan re-articulations of 1930s expressionistic\nideas, even though those voices are audible.\nHe has expressed interest in constructing\nstories that might serve either stage or film\nand which function through metaphor and\nallegory.17 Far from taking existing stories as\nthe basis of his work, he states that he \u2018start[s]\nfrom an idea and then look[s] for texts with\nwhich I can have a dialogue\u2019 (my italics). He\nalso refers to starting from an image \u2013 a clue\nthat seems to inform Strange Fish in its use of\nthe Cross, in the communion wine, in the\npresence of candles, and in the lighting\nchoices that evoke religious moods.18\nNewson reworks ideas within a topical\n1990s political agenda using many media,\nincluding words. In this sense he flouts the\nhighly valued integrity of expressionist dance\n\u2013 its central concern being for expression\nthrough movement alone. Autobiographical\nfragments published in interviews with Andy\nSolway, Jann Parry, and Nadine Meisner\nreveal Newson\u2019s view that what dance can\ndo best is deal with \u2018a very personal investig-\nation\u2019 rather than \u2018social and political themes\non a larger theoretical level\u2019.19 These personal\ninvestigations often concern the individual\u2019s\nplace in society and the exclusion of indivi-\nduals from particular societies. \nTwo threads can be woven here into the\nargument. When challenged by a feminist\naccusation of sexism, he takes up the victim\nposition, saying \u2018everybody in my pieces were\n[sic] victims . . . we\u2019re using the work to ex-\nplore issues which caused us unhappiness,\nbrought about by our own abilities \u2013 as gay\nmen, women \u2013 to play underdogs and accept\nthat\u2019.20 But in recent political argument, and\nin feminist and post-colonial theory, the\nnotion of difference would be more impor-\ntant than the shared one of victimhood. \nThe experience of homophobia is different\nfor men and women, and for different age\ngroups; victimhood is different for varied\nshapes and sizes of people, and for black and\nwhite people. Most importantly, the experi-\nence of men and women is different, even in\ncontemporary culture. While these voices\ncompete, Newson seems to essentialize\nexperience, a position which is entirely con-\nsistent with his expressionist and social-\nrealist views on art, but one which fails to\naddress difference. Newson even constructs\na personal narrative for the dancers based on\npsychological analysis and a concern with\nspirituality (a theatre of alienation, perhaps),\nsaying: \u2018Wendy has lost faith, she\u2019s lost\nfriendship, she\u2019s lost one of the people she\nwants as a friend, Nigel, largely through her\nown actions, and she has isolated herself. In\nher desperate need for friendship, she has\nactually alienated herself to the point that\nshe has lost all sense of belief and faith.\u201921\nThe Voices of Collaborators\nThe dancers\u2019 individuality and personal com-\nmitment are given a voice through impro-\nvisational working methods. Parry refers to a\nthree-and-a-half-month period spent impro-\nvising and shaping material to create Strange\nFish collectively. Newson\u2019s collaborators range\nwidely in experience, age, and physique, but\neach is capable of meeting the challenge of\ndeveloping movement that is distinctively\nhis\/her own, yet appropriate to the theme.22\nThe individuality of modernism is the\nvocal thread here. Newson makes particular\nreference to Diana Payne-Myers\u2019s \u2018fragility\nand her age\u2019,23 but social voices also enter in\nthe nature of the roles taken by Diana Payne-\nMyers. She is over sixty years old, and she\nis sometimes abused, exposed unmercifully \u2013\nperhaps recalling problems the elderly may\nface in some circumstances. This theatre of\ncruelty is revealed in a stage scene not used\nin the video of Strange Fish and in another\nwork, Enter Achilles (1995). \n120\nIn interview, Newson emphasizes the im-\nportance of the collaborative process. Yet the\nperformers\u2019 openness to improvising and to\ntaking responsibility, which he cherishes, has\nto be balanced against his statement that \u2018ulti-\nmately I do make the decisions, set exercises\nand edit material\u2019.24 In the end, the \u2018authorial\nvoices\u2019 are reduced, or at least focused,\nthrough Newson. However, the performers\nare not the only collaborators, since powerful\nmusical voices intervene.\nAncestral Musical Voices\nThe performer\/singer Melanie Pappenheim\nand the composer Jocelyn Pook shared an\ninterest in semi-staged and movement-rich\nperformance long before their collaboration\nin Strange Fish. Their focus had often been on\npalindromic verbal and musical structures\nand on polyrhythmic constructions, of which\nan earlier composition, A Man, a Plan, a\nCanal, Panama is an example. Like Pappen-\nheim, Pook is eclectic in her interests and in\nthe range of her work. Both enjoy moving\nacross genres to bring elements of different\nhistories into relationship.25\nAmong the nostalgic forms relevant to the\nmusic, as well as to the action, of Strange Fish\nis the Lament, a historically varied musical\nand poetic form inspired by rites for the dead\nor ritual leave-taking (bridal laments). This\nceremonial form balances the involuntary\ncry of grief (the \u2018planctus\u2019) and the deliberate\nframing of a message (the \u2018discourse\u2019), repre-\nsenting crisis and order respectively.26 In many\ncultures lamenting is a task entrusted to\nwomen, as it is here. The obsessional quali-\nties of the lament are found also in Mon-\nteverdi and Purcell, where music becomes a\nsite of excess, a deviation that must be\novercome. There is an obvious link to the\nnostalgic longing for Christ found in Strange\nFish and in the compassion for human suf-\nfering that Melanie Pappenheim\u2019s \u2018lament\u2019\nevokes. The understanding of this lament is\ncomplicated by the earlier role adopted by\nthis performer as a female Christ-figure. In\nthe lament, she becomes Mary, Mother of\nGod and Intercessor for us all. \nEven more obvious is the use of plainsong\nas a melodic thread through Strange Fish,\nstructuring the musical ideas of Scenes 1, 5, 9,\n11 and 12 (see the outline structure, above).\nThe improvisatory vocalizing, typical of\nplainsong, is inescapably associated with\nwoman, although this contradicts historical\ntraces of the male-only plainsong practice of\nearlier centuries. Jocelyn Pook and Melanie\nPappenheim\u2019s music reflects plainsong and\nlament quite strongly, despite their late-\ntwentieth-century position; and the music\nis a patchwork of improvised elements. They\nreadily acknowledge their starting points in\n121\nSTRANGE FISH: an outline\nDuration Mins Summary Title\n1 00.00\u201303.17 3.17 Church Scene 1.

Their use of prose rhythm\nprovides another direct link to the plainsong\nperiod.\nContemporary Traces of Ancient Greece\nNewson is particularly indebted to the well-\nknown myth of Heracles. It is the siren figure\nand men\u2019s inability to resist the sensuality of\nwomen which is traced from these sources.\nBut there is more than one version of the\nsiren stories, and an interesting ambiguity\nappears in the final scene where Wendy\nHoustoun, having climbed the cross to reach\nMelanie Pappenheim, pours the holy wine\ndown her throat and then appears to \u2018kiss\u2019\nher \u2013 resoundingly, some critics thought.\nHowever, there is also evidence of another\ntrace of the myth, which talks of sucking the\nbreath from the dying body. To see Strange\nFish as based in several myths and worked\nthrough as a \u2018rite\u2019, may help to explain its\neffectiveness and power. Rather than being\ndependent on external violence, it operates\npersuasively through its own effects, generat-\ning laughter, seducing the emotions, provok-\ning the reconsideration of ideas, swallowing\nthe audience in sensuality, in movement, and\nin music, light, and colour.27\nAs Catherine Bell argues, \u2018The dynamic\ninteraction of texts and rites, reading and\nchanting, the word fixed and the word\npreached are practices, not social develop-\nments of a fixed nature and significance\u2019.28\nNewson can be configured as a choreog-\nrapher\/theatre maker who \u2018ritualizes\u2019 or \u2018re-\nvocalizes\u2019 psychological and mythic events\nin a late-twentieth-century mode, capturing\nthese events and reworking them using\npolitical and consumerist strategies of the\npresent to reinforce the message by mixing\nancient and contemporary voices. \nLloyd Newson is not alone in linking con-\ntemporary psychological and Greek material.\nAn honourable history exists in modern\ndance. As in Martha Graham\u2019s work, there is\noften evidence of the individual making\nsense of her\/his own life and her\/his\nchoreographic work which results in themes\nof death, eroticism and the maternal body.29\nIt might be suggested, rather stereotypically,\nthat for Newson, as an avowedly gay male\nchoreographer, the maternal body is of little\nerotic significance. More to the point, perhaps,\nis the fear of avenging angels, as in Nigel\nCharnock\u2019s fear of Wendy Houstoun. This\ndraws on an \u2018almost universal, deeply seated\naversion to the female body\u2019 which Ramsay\nBurt attributes to the \u2018violence and horror of\nseparation\u2019 from the mother \u2013 a modern\npsychoanalytic interpretation but one which\nresonates with Greek obsessions. \nAn episode embodying this idea appears\nin the stage version of Strange Fish, which is\nnot repeated in the video version, in which\nDiana Payne-Myers, the older dancer who\nappears first of all as a frail, nun-like figure,\nis tossed around by a group of young men,\nlike a doll or a ball. This sadistic entertain-\nment for immature men on a night out sug-\ngests the need to establish their difference.\nWilliam Beers\u2019s demonstration that public\nrituals of the current time continue to be rituals\nof sacrifice seems useful here.30 He argues\nthat, since the \u2018sacred\u2019 is socially constructed,\nthe threat of instability is always present.31\nRitual blood sacrifice is a universal occurrence\namong patrilineal societies. The intrusion of\narchaic forms of narcissism, it is believed, is\nthe source of anxiety disorders in the modern\nworld. Rage and aggression are common\nwhere the individual perceives the activity of\nothers as \u2018wounds to the self\u2019, not as indep-\nendent of the self. \nIt is not unreasonable to suggest that\nStrange Fish can be seen as a ritual of \u2018blood\nsacrifice\u2019 and, applying Beers\u2019s terms, as a\nmale-identified rite that is gender-specific, and an\nexpression of male narcissistic anxiety. Sacrifice\nis understood as an ancient \u2018male-bonding\u2019\nritual, an act of separation from women by\nmeans of which men can both bond with\neach other and appropriate women\u2019s power.\nThis seems a more than adequate character-\nization of Scene 3 in Strange Fish. \nStrange Fish, however, has relatively little\nbonding overall. Rather, it exposes trauma\nand critiques very successfully the uncom-\nfortable nature of society\u2019s rituals. Charac-\n122\nters are presented as real individuals, not as\nrepresentations of some named character or\nas archetypes. This even extends to Wendy\nHoustoun using Nigel Charnock\u2019s real name\nin moments of extremis, just as Nigel add-\nresses individuals by their own names in the\nparty scene. These scenes of social inter-\naction perversely seem to cause distress and\ndiscomfort for the performers, and do not\n\u2018make safe\u2019 dangerous feelings in the way\nmyth is supposed to do. \nOccasionally, Wendy and Nigel glimpse the\npossibility of belonging to a duo or group,\nbut this sense does not last: the fleeting mo-\nment of comfort serves only to point up its\ncontinuing absence. What it does \u2018make safe\u2019\nis another layer which says that it is accep-\ntable at the end of the twentieth century to\nexpose our wildest and most bitter moments,\nas television chat-shows and confessional and\n\u2018reality\u2019 series appear to demonstrate. Any-\nthing less would be trivial perhaps.\nFin de Si\u00e8cle: Voices of the Millennium\nStrange Fish was extremely popular at the\ntime of its making (1992). It was then tele-\nvised (1994) and made available on video\n(BBC\/RMArts).32 It gave rise to extensive\ncomment, although this was largely confined\nto short articles which neither exhaust the\nsubject nor uncover its multiple layers and\ncomplexities. None of the critics made a con-\nnection between the subject matter of this\npiece and the approach of the end of the\nmillennium. In the meantime, however, \u2018mil-\nlennium fever\u2019 developed commercial symp-\ntoms. Religious aspects were considerably\nlower key, reflecting the diminution of inter-\nest in, and of the dominance of, Christianity\nin the western world, although events based\nmore loosely on religious themes were pro-\nminent in certain artistic contexts. \nThese manifestations lent support to the\nidea that, while the number of practising\nchurchgoers in the Anglican Church in the\nUK had sunk to a new low, the story of the\nlife of Jesus Christ and the institution of the\nChurch remained a powerful and enduring\npart of western mythology. In the 2001\nNational Census, the results of which have\nrecently been analyzed, 71 per cent of people\nin this country still describe themselves as\nChristian.\nAn American film, Stigmata (1999, dir.\nRupert Wainwright), tells the story of a girl\nreceiving a rosary from her mother in a\nremote Brazilian village. The wounds of\nChrist appear on her body. The legitimacy of\nthe claims made for her, and the involvement\nof the Vatican, testify to the usefulness of\nthis myth as a set of intertexts. There was an\nexhibition at the National Gallery in London\ncalled Seeing Salvation: the Image of Christ\n(February\u2013May 2000), linked to a BBC TV\nprogramme culminating on Easter Sunday. It\nbrought together 79 images of Christ,\nselected, unlike previous chronological exhi-\nbitions, around several themes: \u2018Sign and\nSymbol\u2019, \u2018The Dual Nature\u2019, \u2018The True Like-\nness\u2019, \u2018Passion and Compassion\u2019, \u2018Praying\nthe Passion\u2019, \u2018The Saving Body\u2019, and \u2018The\nAbiding Presence\u2019. \nHarrison Birtwistle\u2019s opera was specific-\nally commissioned for 2000. He explored the\nsignificance of The Last Supper for the third\nmillennium in a series of dramatic tableaux.\nHe recognizes that these are commodified\nimages, already loaded with history, but per-\nhaps no more or less a commodity than they\nwere in the second, fourth, or fifteenth cen-\nturies. Recycling myths and adapting them\nto fit the changing times is a recurrent\npastime of ideology-makers, whether they\nare religious leaders, politicians, composers,\nchoreographers, or art curators.\nDramatic Narrative Tendencies\nI turn now to voices from within the text.\nStrange Fish self-consciously asks the reader\nto address the question of who is telling the\nstory. The narrator is conventionally seen as\na reliable, external, prophetic voice. In Strange\nFish, however, a number of subject positions\ncan be heard in consequence of the actions of\nthe performers. \nScene 1 seems to engage the reader as if\nfrom Wendy Houstoun\u2019s point of view as she\nmoves around the foot of the cross and be-\nhind the penitent figure kneeling in prayer.\nThe singing voice, on the other hand, encour-\n123\nages sympathy with the figure suspended on\nthe cross. In Scene 2, the active subjects are\nNigel Charnock and Wendy Houstoun, united\nin private, inwardly focused social interaction.\nDespite the increasing number of participants\nin Scene 3, it is Lauren Potter and Wendy\nHoustoun who seem to be controlling the\nviewers\u2019 perspective by initiating unpleasant\nattacks on others. Increasingly, one becomes\naware of the camera director, particularly in\nthe rapid movement of Scene 4. \nIn Scene 5, while sympathy with the lovers\nis generated, the fact that Wendy is watch-\ning, cynically, from the foreground cannot be\nignored, since she usurps the viewer\u2019s posi-\ntion. From the start of Scene 6, there is an\natmosphere of waiting for something to hap-\npen as at a party. Nigel enters babbling into\nthis sociable but rather unfocused gathering.\nFrom then on, his level of anxiety puts one\ndirectly in his position. This is intensified in\nScene 7, in close-focused events where Nigel\nattempts to force his way between other\ncouples. Wendy\u2019s slap on his face, when she\nforces him away, feels like a slap in our own. \nIn Scene 9, where Wendy and Melanie are\npresent (the latter in the role of the Angel),\nthe narrator\u2019s role seems to reside more with\nMelanie as observer of the futility of human\nintercourse. Melanie\u2019s position also seems to\nfocus Scene 11 as she supports the sick figure,\nhere again in the role of the Angel. \nNarrative voices can be perceived not\nonly in the position of narrator but also in the\nlocation of scenes. The church scenes are two\nin number in Strange Fish, strategically placed\nto set the mood and to create a sense of open-\ning up the work and then closing it. The very\nframework of a church calls up notions of\ndignity and humility, reverence and recogni-\ntion of one\u2019s insignificance, belief and prayer\n(rather than agnosticism and atheism), and\njudgement. \nThe most obvious and immediate contrast\nbetween the first and last scenes is in the atmo-\nsphere and mood. The bar scenes (Scenes 3\nand 4, and then the party scene, Scene 6),\nemphasize sociability, desirability, mixing\nwith others, meeting and parting, competi-\ntiveness, personal success and distress. The\noriginal bar scene becomes a party scene illu-\nminated by coloured lights, and the empha-\nsis shifts from small groups to the larger\ngroup. The corridor scenes (Scenes 2, 5, 8,\nand 10) draw on a different set of texts. Corri-\ndors are places for casual meetings, for pass-\ning others with barely a glance, or for furtive,\nsecretive, and intimate moments. There is an\nelement of danger in the narrowness of corri-\ndors, the possibility of confrontation, and the\nthreat of not being able to escape easily. \nEach scene carries different significance\nwithin this agenda, as the title and subse-\nquent action reveal. The idea of corridors,\nperceived as places of potential threat, binds\nScenes 8 to 10, whereas Scenes 2 and 5 em-\nphasize more positive and enjoyable aspects\nof relationships in corridors. While a bar is\nan open environment from which escape is\npossible, and a corridor explicitly raises the\nquestion of escape, some other smaller rooms\ncarry a more intense message. Scenes 7, 9 and\n11 take place in intimate settings, the first in\na social space, but one confined by the use of\nlighting, the second in a \u2018bedroom\u2019, and the\nthird around the sides of a water tank in an\nenclosed space. There is greater possibility in\nthese environments for deep and genuine\ncommunication, whether agonized or joyful. \nIndividual Voices\nThe spaces which the video creates set the\nscene for individual action. Wendy Houstoun\ntakes the role of the quintessential observer\nand malicious influence. She is often alone\nand alienated, but makes constant efforts to\ndisrupt the relationships of others and to\nmanipulate outcomes, as in the bar scenes.\nHer own attempts at intimacy always seem\nto be doomed. First conniving with Lauren\nPotter and then attempting to destroy her is\none of Wendy\u2019s specialities. \nIn Scene 4, Molina\u2019s self-absorbed sensu-\nality is shattered by Wendy\u2019s and Lauren\u2019s\npredatory, circling, teasing game. It is Lauren\nwho succumbs to the male in this disturbing\npiece, not Wendy, here or ever. Group relation-\nships reveal the underlying individual voices\nof desperation. Their interactions range in\ntone from the compulsive emotional depen-\ndency of Lauren and Jordi getting together in\n124\nScene 4 to the compulsive, mindless sex of\nWendy and Dale in Scene 9, and the utterly\nterrifying demonstration of emotional need\nbetween Wendy and Nigel, which ends in\nviolence (Scene 10). \nEven loving consolation is marred by the\nbittersweet sadness in Scene 11 of baptism\nand absolution between Melanie as \u2018Angel\u2019\nand Dale, the dying sufferer. Intimidation\nand competition (Scene 3), with the group\nlending approval, is compounded by the\nparty (Scene 6), where deeply unkind acts\ncontinue. Neither is there mercy or sym-\npathy or pity, as Scene 9\u2019s aftermath of sex is\njudged by the group. The ultimate betrayal is\nthe Judas kiss that Wendy forces on Christ \u2013\nMelanie \u2013 since it leads to death. \nConclusion\nIt is often argued that the Christian message\nis described as universal not because every-\none believes it but because of its successful\nassimilation of the pre-Christian religious\nheritage \u2013 the Cross as the tree of life, the\nritual use of wine \u2013 as well as its continuous\nuse over two thousand years. Ancient stories\nabout fish are also inherited. Tales of Hindu\nand Chinese goddesses, known as fish god-\ndesses, were the precursors of the penis-\nswallowing Kali, also known as Minaksi (the\nfish-eyed). Swallowing genitals and giving\nbirth to rivers \u2013 and gods \u2013 is a significant\nway not only of expressing the fears of the\nmale (as Freudian commentators suggest),\nbut also of conferring greater power and dig-\nnity on the male, mainly by appropriating\nfeatures particular to women.33\nLess violent, but still common in many\nwestern cultures, is the practice of eating fish\non Fridays, recalling the orgiastic fish-eating\ngoddess Salacia. James Davidson argues that\nthe Greeks were passionately fond of fish,\nwhich amounted to a dominant obsession in\nfourth-century discourses.34 A twist to this\nstory is that the fish involved in this literal or\nmetaphorical seduction may have been a\nsource of occult power, as well as being as\n\u2018mouth-watering\u2019 as women. Nothing is so\nsimple, however. Interpretations of fish mad-\nness may have been ironic, since the appre-\nciation of fish \u2013 in contrast to the public,\nsacrificial position of animals \u2013 was part of a\nprivate and modern discourse of connoisseur-\nship. Comedy at that time included shop-\nping lists, fish menus, and recipes.\nThe intertextual point is that the texts\nrelevant to Strange Fish have traces of the\nimmediate present, as well as of the suppos-\nedly dead past. If it is obvious that \u2018all texts\ncontain traces of other texts\u2019, then a more\nsophisticated version of this idea draws atten-\ntion to \u2018the interactions between texts, pro-\nducers of texts and their readers\u2019 lifeworlds\u2019.35\nThere are several threads of intertextuality\nand of gender politics operating within the\nwork. Each of these referential strands, and\ntheir interactions, are compounded by my\nown response to the \u2018texts\u2019 that are Strange\nFish. They illustrate both the constraints on\ninterpretation and the potential for endless\nreinterpretation. Paradoxically, intertextuality\nallows the reader to \u2018create the text\u2019 and,\nsimultaneously, to \u2018read the text as it wishes\nto be read\u2019.36 Or, expressed in another way,\nit is \u2018a tool which cannot be employed by\nreaders wishing to produce stability and\norder, or wishing to claim authority over the\ntext or other critics\u2019, but one which continu-\nously opens up possibilities of reading.37\nNotes and References\n1.
