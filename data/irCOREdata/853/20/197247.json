Expression of Akt and ERK proteins was studied by Western blot in adenomas to discover effects of anthocyanins on cellular signalling via the PI3 and MAP kinase pathways. Levels of anthocyanins were measured by HPLC with visible spectroscopic or mass spectrometric detection.\\ud\nResults:\\ud\nIn mice which had consumed oenocyanin, overall adenoma burden was halved and adenoma number was marginally reduced when compared with mice on control diet. The proliferation index in colonic adenomatous crypts, as reflected by Ki-67 staining, was significantly decreased from 88.14% in control mice to 75.6 \u00b1 4% in mice on oenocyanin (P = 0.014). Expression of Akt in small intestinal adenomas from ApcMin mice on oenocyanin was reduced by 54% (P = 0.003), when compared to controls. Oenocyanin anthocyanins and glucuronide metabolites were found in the urine and intestine but not in plasma.\\ud\nConclusions:\\ud\nThe results suggest that oenocyanin may be a viable and economical alternative to anthocyanin-rich berry extracts for chemopreventive intervention.
