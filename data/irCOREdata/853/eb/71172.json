Electron precipitation can be modulated by geo-\nmagnetic pulsation activity. This can be observed as pulsa-\ntion of cosmic noise absorption as measured by riometers.\nObservations of such pulsations exhibiting field-line reso-\nnance and particle-driven characteristics using an imaging\nriometer are presented and the capability of the instrument\nto map their spatial structure is demonstrated. It is shown\nthat for the events studied, the spatial variation of pulsation\nphase as measured by the riometer agrees with that inferred\nfrom ground-based magnetometers, whereas the spatial vari-\nation of pulsation amplitude may show a different structure.\nIt is suggested that this is consistent with the mechanism\nproposed by Coroniti and Kennel (1970) where one would\nexpect a fixed phase relationship between magnetic and ab-\nsorption pulsations, but where the amplitude of the absorp-\ntion pulsation can depend on several factors other than the\namplitude of the magnetic pulsation.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionosphere\u2013magnetosphere inter-\nactions; particle precipitation) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics\n(MHD waves and instabilities)\n1 Introduction\nGeomagnetic pulsations have been studied extensively\nthrough the use of ground-based magnetometer data and\nsatellite data (e.g. Campbell, 1973; McPherron et al., 1972).\nGround-based magnetometers have a wide field-of-view, the\ndiameter of which is often taken to be equal to the height\nof the ionospheric E-layer, that is, around 120 km, but their\nobservations are constrained by the \u201cscreening\u201d effect of\nthe ionosphere which serves to modify the structure of the\nwave field from that actually present in the magnetosphere\n(Hughes and Southwood, 1976). One consequence of this is\nthat waves with small spatial scale sizes can have ground am-\nplitudes greatly reduced from their magnetospheric values,\napproximately in proportion to the factor exp(\u2212k), where k\nCorrespondence to: A. Senior (a.senior@lancaster.ac.uk)\nis the horizontal wave number. Satellites, on the other hand,\nare able to make in situ observations of the magnetospheric\nwave field, but are limited by their orbits to observing one\npart of the magnetosphere for a short period.\nAs observed on the ground, the spatial structure of magne-\ntospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves may be described\nin terms of their amplitude and phase variations with latitude\nand longitude. These variations have different characters for\ndifferent types of wave activity. Orr (1984) describes the\nvariation of amplitude and phase exhibited by field-line reso-\nnance events \u2014 forced oscillations of the magnetosphere. In\na field-line resonance, the amplitude distribution is peaked at\na particular latitude, corresponding to field lines whose nat-\nural frequencies are the same as that of the forcing wave. At\nthe same time, the phase shows a 180\u25e6 shift with latitude,\ncentred on the resonant latitude. Generally, the phase equa-\ntorwards of the resonant latitude leads that poleward of it,\nbut it is possible for the reverse to be the case when the res-\nonance occurs near the plasmapause. Other types of waves\nexhibit significant phase variations with longitude (azimuthal\nphase variations). These waves may be excited by drift- or\ndrift-bounce resonant interactions with particles (Southwood\net al., 1969). A parameter of significance for these waves\nis their azimuthal wave number, m, defined as the number of\ncomplete wavelengths in one azimuthal circuit of the Earth or\nequivalently, the number of degrees phase change per degree\nof longitude.\nThere have been a number of observations using wide-\nbeam riometers and balloon-borne X-ray detectors of elec-\ntron precipitation pulsations associated with magnetospheric\nULF wave activity with the same periodicity (Ziauddin,\n1960; Anger et al., 1963; Heacock and Hunsucker, 1977; Ol-\nson et al., 1980; Higuchi et al., 1988). One interpretation of\nthese observations is that the electron precipitation is in some\nway modulated by the ULF wave. If this is the case, then\nthere exists the possibility of using the spatial structure of this\nprecipitation as a proxy for the spatial structure of the wave.\nThe large-scale spatial structure of these events has been\nstudied previously, for example, by Barcus and Rosenberg\n998 A.

They used balloon observations of bremsstrahlung\nX-rays and cosmic noise absorption from wide-beam riome-\nters to investigate the electron precipitation. They observed\nthat the precipitation activity occurred in belt-like regions\nover 1000 km long and 100\u2013400 km across. Kikuchi et al.\n(1988) made use of a scanning narrow-beam riometer to in-\nvestigate the spatial structure in one dimension with a high\nresolution. This led to the discovery of a type of absorp-\ntion pulsation having a high m-number and eastward prop-\nagation. The development of the imaging riometer (Detrick\nand Rosenberg, 1990) has made possible the observation of\na two-dimensional small-scale spatial structure of electron\nprecipitation pulsations. Imaging riometer observations of\nprecipitation pulsations have been reported by Rosenberg et\nal. (1991) and Weatherwax et al. (1997). This paper demon-\nstrates a new technique for analysing the data based on map-\nping the amplitude and phase variations of the pulsation and\ncompares the results to theory.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E, L = 5.95) (Browne\net al., 1995) provides continuous measurements of the iono-\nspheric absorption of cosmic noise at 38.2 MHz. Riometric\nabsorption is generally attributed to precipitation of energetic\nelectrons which cause enhanced ionisation in the D-region of\nthe ionosphere where the electron-neutral collision frequency\nis large. The riometer uses an 8\u00d7 8 phased array of crossed-\ndipole antennas to produce a 7 \u00d7 7 array of beams.

For\nthe data presented in this paper, the usual mapping height\nof 90 km has been used, giving a field-of-view of approxi-\nmately 200\u00d7 200 km with a spatial resolution of 20\u201340 km.\nThe antenna array is aligned so that the central \u201crow\u201d and\n\u201ccolumn\u201d of beams are aligned geographically west-east and\nnorth-south, respectively. Absorption images are created by\ninterpolating the point measurements from the beams onto\na regular grid. Absorption measurements with riometers are\nsometimes affected by ionospheric scintillation in the pres-\nence of a strong point source of radio waves at the frequency\nof operation, such as a \u201cradio star\u201d. Scintillation causes ran-\ndom large-amplitude short-period variations of cosmic noise\npower and hence, of measured absorption. Usually only a\nsmall number of imaging riometer beams are affected in this\nway at any one time. In this paper, all data from beams af-\nfected by scintillation have been excluded from the analysis,\nwith the exception of the time-series plots in Fig. 5.\nMagnetic data were provided by the International Mon-\nitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) (Lu\u00a8hr et\nal., 1998), a magnetometer network with stations distributed\nacross Fenno-Scandia. Figure 1 shows the locations of the\ninstruments used in this study and also the field-of-view of\nIRIS at a height of 90 km. This field-of-view corresponds to\nthat used for the images presented in this paper.\n3 Observations\nWe present observations of two pulsation events having dif-\nferent characteristics occuring in late April and early May\n1995 and observed with IRIS and the IMAGE magnetometer\narray.\nA.

Amplitudes and phases of absorption and magnetic X-\ncomponents for Event 1.\n3.1 Event 1\nBetween 05:50 and 06:00 UT on 3 May 1995, a pulsation\nwith a period of approximately 150 s and, therefore, on the\nboundary between the Pc4 and Pc5 bands was observed in\nthe IRIS absorption. Simultaneously, a pulsation with the\nsame period was also observed in the IMAGE array. Figure 2\nshows the time series of absorption from the central north-\nsouth column of the IRIS beams and the X-components of\nthe IMAGE stations. The time series have been band-pass-\nfiltered to the period range 40\u2013600 s, covering the Pc4 and\nPc5 bands. The plots show that there is a clear north-south\nphase shift in the pulsation observed in the absorption, with\nthe south leading the north in phase. The same pattern can\nbe observed in the magnetometer X-components, although\nthere is some confusion in the traces around KEV (Kevo) and\nTRO (Troms\u00f8), which is probably due to the wide separation\nin longitude of these stations.\nFigure 3 shows plots of the amplitude and phase of the\npeak Fourier component of the spectra of the absorption and\nX-component time series. The phase has been referenced to\nzero at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, which is where the amplitude peak in the\nX-component occurs. The phases of theX-components show\na 180\u25e6 swing through the amplitude peak and this observa-\ntion suggests that the pulsation takes the form of a field-line\nresonance, that is, a forced oscillation of the magnetosphere.\nThe phases of the pulsation in the IRIS beams match well\nwith this pattern; however, the amplitudes do not correspond\nwith the X-component amplitudes but instead show a mono-\ntonic decrease with increasing latitude.\nWe may use the two-dimensional capability of the imag-\ning riometer to construct a map of the amplitude and phase\nvariations of the pulsation. Given a time series of absorption\nfor each beam over the period of interest, we can produce a\ntime series of images of absorption in the manner described\nin Sect. 2.

One of the\nIRIS beams is affected by scintillation which explains the ir-\nregular time series for this beam.\nA spectral analysis of the time series of absorption and\nmagnetic Y -component reveals that this pulsation is bichro-\nmatic, with spectral peaks at 7.8 and 9.4 mHz. Figure 6\nshows the spectra for this event. The 9.4 mHz component\nis dominant in the absorption. Magnetometers TRO and KIL\nunder the IRIS field-of-view show the biggest response at\n9.4 mHz, but the 7.8 mHz component always dominates the\n9.4 mHz component in the magnetometers. Note that the\nspectrum of the IRIS beam affected by scintillation shown\nin Fig. 5 has been omitted, since the scintillation renders its\nspectrum difficult to interpret. In order to investigate the\nstructure of this dual pulsation, we may carry out the same\nmapping procedure used for Event 1, but applying it this\ntime to both spectral components. The results can be seen\nin Fig. 7. The amplitude maps show that the two pulsations\nmaximise in different parts of the field-of-view, and that both\nregions are somewhat elongated and approximately L-shell\naligned. The phase map for the 9.4 mHz component \u2014 dom-\ninant in the absorption \u2014 exhibits a clear azimuthal phase\nshift of about 120\u25e6 across the field-of-view, corresponding to\nan azimuthal wave number m \u2248 22.\nThe 7.8 mHz component, on the other hand, shows a\nnorth-east\/south-west phase shift, with phases in the north-\neast leading those in the southwest. The azimuthal compo-\nnent of this phase shift, corresponding to m \u2248 18, is in the\nsame direction as the 9.4 mHz component. The presence of\nthe additional north-south phase shift is in marked contrast\nto the 9.4 mHz component, however.\nThis event occurs in the morning sector (approximately\n05:45 MLT) and both frequency components show a west-\nward phase propagation. This suggests that these pulsations\n0 5 10 15 20\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\nFrequency (mHz)\nLo\nng\nitu\nde\nAbsorption\n0 5 10 15 20\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\nTRO\nKIL\nSOR\nMAS\nKEV\nFrequency (mHz)\nIMAGE Y\u2212components\nFig. 6.

The north-south\nphase shift of the 7.8 mHz component with the north lead-\ning the south in phase suggests that this component could\nbe exhibiting field-line resonance characteristics across the\nplasmapause (Orr, 1984), though this seems unlikely since\ngeomagnetic activity was moderate to high over the 24 hours\npreceeding the event (2\u2212 \u2264 Kp \u2264 5\u2212), meaning that the\nplasmasphere was probably quite depleted and the plasma-\npause was at much lower L-values than those in the field-of-\nview at the time of the event.\n4 Discussion\nRiometric absorption is generally attributed to precipitation\nof energetic electrons which cause enhanced ionisation in the\nD-region of the ionosphere where the electron-neutral colli-\nsion frequency is large. It seems natural, therefore, to at-\ntribute pulsations in the absorption to pulsations in the elec-\ntron precipitation. Precipitation pulsations events have been\nobserved previously using imaging riometers. Rosenberg et\nal. (1991) showed an example of a quasi-periodic Pc5-like\npulsation. They did not carry out any detailed analysis of\nthe structure of the event, except to state that it was uniform\nacross the field-of-view. Also, they did not compare the ri-\nometer observations with magnetometer data. Later, Weath-\nerwax et al. (1997) showed an example of Pc5-modulated\nprecipitation. They compared the observations with magne-\ntometer data and found similar spectral features. They also\nnoted that the pulsation was confined to a narrow (\u223c 1\u25e6) lat-\nitude band embedded in a background of steady precipita-\nA. Senior and F.

The maps cover the time interval 03:00\u201303:30 UT.\ntion. This is similar to our observations in Event 2. Weather-\nwax et al. (1997) did not, however, make use of the analysis\ntechnique demonstrated here to map the amplitude and phase\nvariations of the pulsation.\nCoroniti and Kennel (1970) developed a theory of how\nelectron precipitation could be modulated by a magnetic pul-\nsation. The principle is that precipitation is induced by an\nelectron pitch-angle diffusion process driven by the Doppler-\nshifted cyclotron resonance interaction with whistler-mode\nwaves. An equilibrium, corresponding to a steady precipita-\ntion state, exists which is then disturbed by the magnetic pul-\nsation that modulates the growth-rate of the whistler-mode\nturbulence and hence, modulates the precipitation. Haugstad\n(1975) discussed some objections to this theory and proposed\nmodifications to it to correct them. Under this Coroniti-\nKennel-Haugstad (CKH) theory, one would expect a fixed\nphase relationship between the magnetic pulsation and the\nresulting precipitation pulsation, so that the spatial variations\nof the two would be the same. It is not possible to compare\nexactly the phase variations observed by the magnetometer\nand the riometer due to their differing spatial resolutions, but\nthey appear to be similar for the events reported here.\nThere is evidence, however, that the amplitudes of the ab-\nsorption and magnetic pulsations do not agree. In Event 1,\nthe phase variations observed both by the magnetometers and\nby the riometer put the resonant L-shell close to the centre\nof the IRIS field-of-view, since this is the centre of the 180\u25e6\nphase swing. The peak amplitude in the absorption, however,\noccurs towards the equatorward edge of the field-of-view. In\ngeneral, we might not expect the amplitudes of absorption\nand magnetic pulsations to correspond in terms of their spa-\ntial distribution, since, under the CKH theory, the amplitude\nof the absorption pulsation depends on several factors, in-\ncluding the amplitude of the magnetic pulsation and the na-\nture (strong or weak) of the pitch-angle diffusion process.\nThe energy of the precipitated electrons would also affect the\nlevel of absorption produced.\nIt is interesting to compare the background levels of ab-\nsorption with the amplitudes of the absorption pulsation. The\nCKH theory suggests that the effect of the pulsation modu-\nlation is only to raise the precipitation rate (and hence ab-\nsorption) above the level which would exist in the absence of\nthe pulsation. Therefore, in this study, the \u201cbackground\u201d has\nbeen estimated from the minima of the absorption time series\n1002 A. Senior and F.

Figure 8 shows the background absorp-\ntion for Event 1. Here we see that the absorption maximizes\nto the south and west. The pulsation maximizes to the south.\nFigure 9 shows the background absorption for Event 2. In\nthis case, the absorption maximizes to the north. The 9.4\nmHz component of the pulsation maximizes in a very well-\ndefined L-shell-aligned band equatorward of the peak back-\nground absorption. The 7.8 mHz component is more evenly\ndistributed across the field-of-view but also peaks equator-\nward of the peak background absorption. These observa-\ntions demonstrate that maximum absorption and maximum\nabsorption pulsation amplitude do not necessarily coincide\nand that a significant amplitude of absorption pulsation can\nexist on a relatively low background absorption. This is con-\nsistent with the CKH theory which indicates an exponential\ndependence of precipitation rate on the magnetic pulsation\namplitude.\nWe should add that Weatherwax et al. (1997) believed that\ntheir observations were not consistent with the CKH theory\nand suggested several alternative theories. However, their\nobservations were made on much higher L-shells on closed\nfield-lines which mapped deep into the tail and it is possible\nthat a different mechanism might indeed be responsible for\nthe precipitation pulsation in this case.\n5 Conclusions\nIn summary, imaging riometers have been employed to map\nthe spatial structure of pulsation events which show an ab-\nsorption signature in terms of their distribution of amplitude\nand phase. Maps of the phase of the absorption pulsation\nappear to be in agreement with phase measurements from\nground-based magnetometers, whereas maps of the ampli-\ntude appear not to show such good agreement.
