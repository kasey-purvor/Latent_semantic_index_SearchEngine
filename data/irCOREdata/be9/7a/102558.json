This study sets out to explore the experience of computer \nanxiety and is in two parts.  The first part examines computer anxiety in the context of \nDSM-IV criteria for specific phobia by comparing the incidence of underlying beliefs of \nthose high in computer anxiety with people with spider phobia and with a non-anxious \ngroup.  185 participants filled in questionnaires concerning general and specific measures \nof anxiety.

However, several of the cognitions core to the \nexperience of spider phobia were not found in the computer anxious participants.  \nExamination of individual cognitions revealed that the kinds of concerns being expressed \nwere more akin to social or test anxiety (\u2018I would make a fool of myself\u2019) than to specific \nphobia (\u2018I would scream\u2019, \u2018I would become hysterical\u2019).   In a further exploration of this, \nthe second study with 164 participants compared aspects of computer anxiety and \navoidance with measures of social, performance, and test anxiety.  These were found to \nbe significantly related to each other.  The implications and limitations of the studies are \ndiscussed. \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 3\nIntroduction \n \nIt fairly well established that a fear of technology in general (mobile phones, video \nrecorders, microwave ovens and so on), and of computers in particular, exists (see \nBrosnan, 1998a for a review) and constitutes \u2018a real phenomenon\u2019 (Moldafsky & Kwon, \n1994: 301).  There is evidence that this anxiety is more prevalent in females than in males \n(e.g. Abdelhamid, 2002; Brosnan, 1998b,c,1999a; Durndell & Haag, 2002; Igbaria & \nChakrabarti 1990), though Rosen and Maguire (1990) found no evidence for this. \nIncreasing familiarity with technology often relates to lower levels of computer anxiety,  \n(Choi, Ligon & Ward, 1999; Shashaani, 1997; Maurer, 1994) but can also exacerbate it \n(Carlson & Wright, 1993). Rosen and Maguire (1990) highlight that that although an \ninverse relationship tends to exist between computer experience and anxiety this is \nconfounded by highly anxious individuals actively avoiding computer interaction. Thus \nin a sub-set of the computer anxious, it remains a problem and extends beyond the fear of \nthe technology to a distrust and fear of computer experts and \u2018technocrats\u2019 (Wilson, \n1999).  There is however increasing evidence that the nature of the experience with \ntechnology determines its impact upon computer anxiety and that such anxiety is \namenable to change by brief, well-structured, intervention programmes (Rosen, Sears & \nWeil, 1993, Wilson 1999, Shashaani, 1997; Brosnan & Thorpe, in press). \n   \nThe prevalence rates  for computer anxiety are obscured by the fact that it is described in \ndifferent ways using different titles \u2013 computer anxiety, techno anxiety, technophobia, \ncomputer aversion, cyberanxiety and computerphobia (for a discussion of this see Choi et \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 4\nal., 1999). However, virtually every population tested (such as the Police, Teachers, \nOffice workers, College students and school children) report that between a quarter and a \nhalf of those sampled report some level of anxiety when faced with information \ntechnology (Brosnan 1998a). Lee (1970) is frequently credited with the first analysis of \nan emerging computer anxiety. In over three decades since this initial study there has \nbeen an exponential expansion of technology in leisure, work and educational \nenvironments.  However, studies spanning these decades report consistent proportions of \ncomputer anxious individuals (Durndell and Thomson, 1997). The prevalence rates are \nalso consistent across the USA and Europe (Rosen & Weil, 1995; Weil & Rosen, 1995) \nthe Middle East (Omar, 1992) and the far East (Brosnan & Lee, 1998). The proliferation \nof technology has shifted the strategies of the computer anxious from avoidance (as this \nbecame increasingly untenable) to a strategy of minimising interaction with technology \nand suffering an aversive state during this interaction (Marcoulides, 1998; Rosen et al., \n1987). The addition of the suffix \u2018phobia\u2019 in this context has lead to misunderstanding, \ncarrying with it as it does the suggestion of  people rearing back in alarm at the sight of a \npalm pilot or a computer monitor, as those people with a specific phobia of snakes for \ninstance may do.  Research examining the extent of aversive reactions to technology \nhighlights a sliding scale from \u2018uncomfortable user\u2019 through to \u2018phobic\u2019 (Rosen et al., \n1993; Meier, 1985) with around 5% falling into this latter category, reporting symptoms \nsuch as sweaty palms and heart palpitations (Rosen et al., 1993).  A formal investigation \nof computer anxiety as psychopathology has not yet been undertaken however, and forms \nthe rationale for the present study which seeks to explore the links between computer \nanxiety and specific phobias as defined by DSM IV criteria. \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 5\n \nDefinitions of computer anxiety have varied according to the context in which they are \nbeing discussed.  Jay (1981) for example, characterised it as a resistance to talking about \ncomputers, fear or anxiety about them, and hostile or aggressive thoughts about them.  \nRosen and Weil (1990) noted that concerns included anxiety about current or future \ninteractions, negative global attitudes, anxiety about operating computers successfully, \nkinds of impact they may have on society, and\/or \u2018specific negative cognitions or self-\ncritical internal dialogues during actual computer interaction or when contemplating \nfuture computer interaction.\u2019 Rosen and Weil (1990: 276).  Brosnan summarizes these \n(and other) definitions thus: \u2018an irrational anticipation of fear evoked by the thought of \nusing (or actually using) computers, the effects of which result in avoiding, or \nminimizing, computer usage\u2019 (Brosnan, 1998a: 17).  Although this definition of computer \nanxiety was arrived at by synthesizing the literature on computer anxiety it appears to \noverlap with some of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders.  However, \ndefinitions of phobias in a clinical context usually include measures of distress, of \ninterference in daily life and of avoidance of situations in which the feared object or \nsituation may be found, all of which domains remain under-explored in relation to \ncomputer anxiety.  Additionally, the propensity to suffer from computer anxiety may be \nrelated to social or performance fears or to test anxiety rather than to fears of specific \nstimuli: if this were indeed the case, cognitions found in those who evince anxiety in the \npresence of computers may be more akin to those found in the spectrum of social \nanxieties rather than those found in people who are afraid of specific objects or situations. \nPossible support for this hypothesis has come from the finding that the mere presence of \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 6\nothers has been found to accentuate self-perceptions of computer-related anxiety (Gist, \nSchwoerer & Rosen, 1989; Robinson-Staveley & Cooper, 1990).  This would lead to \nmanifestly different behaviours in the computer anxious from those found in people with \na specific fear: a spider phobic for example may be reassured in the presence of someone \nwho might help while the computer anxious person may find the presence of someone \nmore anxiety provoking although the use of others for support has also been noted \n(Brosnan, 1998b). \n \nThe rationale for the study was given further support by contact with members of the \npublic who, during initial investigations while speaking about their fear of technology, \nvolunteered the following:  \n\u201cI believe I am absolutely, wildly, technophobic. Even when I hear people on the \ntelephone telling me to do various things, I cannot do it. I cannot do my video. I have \nnever used my cash card in the bank and I do not know how to use a computer, I am \nabsolutely terrified - don\u2019t even know what the mouse is\u201d. (C.V.). \n \n\u201cI am 56 years old and have been using a P.C. at work for sometime. I am O.K. as long as \neverything is set up but to have to do something new \u2013 I can\u2019t do it. We have an intranet \nand I can\u2019t surf it or the internet. To set up a work sheet is like climbing mount Everest. I \nwrite everything down but this takes ages and people showing you more than once get \nfed up with you. I work in accounts and have been a supervisor for years so I can\u2019t be \ncompletely daft. I\u2019ve had a video for years and I only play videos. Also I have a \nmicrowave oven for a Christmas present and it\u2019s not been used yet\u201d. (K.G). \n  \n\u201dI hated computers but this year, as I have started to study for a degree, I had to face the \nreality of the monsters, computers. I have been very stressed and often crying in front of a \ncomputer screen. I am learning to use them but I still hate them. Why does it have to be \nlike that? I bought a mobile phone the other day and the technology involved in it scared \nme, why does this technology have to make our life so painful?\u201d (A.M) \n \nIn sum, the present study seeks to explore the issue from a novel perspective, by \ncomparing computer anxiety to an extensively studied phobia which has clear criteria laid \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 7\ndown by a recognized diagnostic system and which is common in all populations \u2013 spider \nphobia.   The field so far has suffered from the liberal use of the terms \u2018technophobia\u2019 \nand \u2018computerphobia\u2019 without there being any real evidence of psychopathology.  If \ncomputer anxiety is comparable in terms of amount of distress, range of underlying \ncognitions, and is associated with the kinds of escape\/avoidance behaviour patterns found \nin specific phobia (Thorpe & Salkovskis 1998) then it should share some of the \nunderlying beliefs found in these phobias and should be equally susceptible to those \ntreatment strategies found to be successful with people who have specific phobias.  It \nshould also be taken seriously. The present paper therefore describes two studies \ndesigned to explore these issues.  The first study addresses the question as to whether \nhigh levels of computer anxiety conform to psychopathological standards i.e. \u2013 are people \nafraid of technology -  in this instance computer technology - to a comparable extent to \nthe fear felt by those who meet DSM criteria for specific phobia?  It then goes on to \nidentify underlying cognitions relating to computer anxiety and explores the possibility \nthat they may either be comparable to those found in people with a specific phobia or \nmay be more akin to those cognitions found in people with social, performance or test \nanxiety.   \nThe second study is an exploratory study of the relationship between the types of \ncognition found in computer anxiety and those found in social\/performance anxiety and \ntest anxiety.  It was anticipated that this may extend knowledge of what may become an \nincreasingly important problem for a significant minority of people (as computers \nbecome all-pervasive and underpin all daily functioning) and may additionally provide \ninformation of possible use in an educational or therapeutic context.  \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 8\n \n \nMethod \nStudy 1 \nParticipants \n \n185 participants (101 non-anxious, 51 computer anxious and 33 spider phobics)  were \ndrawn from a variety of sources, including members of the public responding to an article \nin a local paper or to posters in local libraries, undergraduate students, and spider phobics \nvolunteering for experiments in return for treatment.   Participants were allocated to the \ncomputer anxious group if their scores on the visual analogue anxiety scale were within \none standard deviation of the scores of the people with spider phobia on their comparable \nscale to do with spiders. Of those participants who provided their demographic details, \n82% were female and 18% male.  Mean age of the non anxious group was 23.88, (range \n18 to 72, sd 11.23), the computer anxious group was 26.79 (range 18 to 70, sd 13.87) and \nthe spider phobics was 23.3 (range 18 to 51, sd 6.40).   \n \n \nProcedure \nParticipants volunteered after becoming aware of the research via adverts in local \nlibraries, an article in the local paper or as part of the University Research Participation \nScheme.  They contacted the researchers and were either sent the questionnaires and \nasked to return them in a prepaid envelope, or were asked to fill them in during a teaching \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 9\nsession.  Participants with spider phobia filled in the questionnaires when they attended \nan extended experimental session prior to receiving treatment for their phobia.  All \nfulfilled DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia. \n \n. \nMaterials \n1. The Demographic details questionnaire collected information about age, sex, extent of \nprevious computing experience in years, whether they were \u2018especially afraid of\u2019 \nanimals, heights, closed spaces, or blood\/injury.  They were asked to write down \nanything else of which they were afraid. \n \n2. Phobic beliefs (Thorpe & Salkovskis 1995).  This was initially based on the Chambless \nAgoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire.   The initial question concerned how \u2018confident \nare you that you would be able to tolerate being in the same room as a spider right now \u2018.  \nThe scale ranged form 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (totally confident).  Next, subjects \nrated how much they believed each of 31 statements to be true on a scale of 0 (I do not \nbelieve this thought at all) to 100 (I am completely convinced this thought is true) while \nimagining that their phobic object is in the room with them.  Questions belonged to three \ncategories : harm (e.g. \u201cI would have a heart attack\u201d); coping (e.g. \u201cI would not cope with \nit\u201d); and disgust (e.g. \u201cI would find it repulsive\u201d).   For the non-anxious and computer \nanxious participants, the word \u2018computer\u2019 was substituted for \u2018spider\u2019. \n \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 10\n3. Spielberger STAI y-1 self-evaluation questionnaire (present state anxiety) and the \nSpielberger STAI y-2 self-evaluation questionnaire (general trait anxiety) (Spielberger \n1983).   \n4. Watts and Sharrock Spider Phobia Questionnaire (1984).  \n \n5a. Measures of anxiety, avoidance and distress were gathered using 3 visual analogue \nLikert-type scales rated on a scale of 0 to 100 where the anchors were \u2018strongly agree\u2019 \nand \u2018strongly disagree\u2019.   Statements were as follows: a) I always feel anxious when using \ncomputers b) I go out of my way to avoid computers c) My anxiety about computers \nbothers me.  \n5b. As the straight substitution of \u2018spider\u2019 for \u2018computer\u2019 did not make sense, (computer \nanxiety involving use of computers rather than being in the mere presence of them) \nparticipants with spider phobia had a comparable visual analogue containing 3 items \nparalleling those above but which were spider-relevant.  Participants were asked to rate \nthe items (while imagining they were in the room with a spider) on a scale of 0 to 100 \nwhere the anchors were again \u2018strongly agree\u2019 and \u2018strongly disagree\u2019.  Items were as \nfollows: a) I feel extremely anxious b) I want to escape very much c) I cannot cope with \nmy anxiety about spiders.  These measures were assessed independently by raters as \nbeing comparable in terms of measuring anxiety, avoidance and distress.  \n \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 11\nResults \nStudy 1 \nOverview. \nData exploration began with an examination of demographic data relating to the three \ngroups \u2013 participants who were non-anxious, computer anxious and participants with \nspider phobia.  Following this, data were checked for assumptions of normality.  Data \nconcerning anxiety responses and beliefs relating to the phobic object (computers or \nspiders) were found to be skewed so transformations were carried out to normalise the \ndata before analysis.  As not all participants filled in all questionnaires, and many \nexercised their right to withhold demographic details, numbers in the subsequent analyses \nfluctuate. \nData analysis then proceeded as follows: \n1) Comparisons of age, state and trait anxiety scores in the three groups.  \n2) Spider phobics\u2019 scores on the DSM IV-derived visual analogue scales relating to \nanxiety, avoidance and distress were compared with scores relating to computer \nanxiety, avoidance and distress in the other two groups.  This was done to check \nwhether the computer anxious were reaching comparable levels of reaction to \ncomputers as the spider phobics were to spiders (who were all diagnosed as \nsuffering from phobia and who were seeking treatment) and that both groups were \ndifferent to the reactions of the non-anxious. \n3) Scores of individual participants were examined and percentages of individuals \nwith beliefs held at a phobic level (in line with Thorpe & Salkovskis 1995)  were \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 12\ncompared in the computer anxious and spider phobia groups, and examined in \nrelation to those judged to be most crucial to the experience of spider phobia .   \n \nAge, and State and Trait anxiety Scores \nFirst, a one way analysis of variance was performed on age.  There was no significant \ndifference between the groups (F2,134=1.085, p=.342).  Second, a one way analysis of \nvariance was performed on state and trait anxiety scores.  There was a significant \nbetween groups difference in state anxiety scores (F2,142=4.933, p=.008) and trait anxiety \nscores (F2,140=5.193, p=.007).  Tukey\u2019s test revealed that in the case of trait anxiety \nscores, there were two homogenous subsets which consisted of: a) the non anxious  and \nspider phobic and then b) the spider phobic and the computer anxious, indicating that the \nspider phobic participants\u2019 scores lay between the non-anxious and the computer anxious \nparticipants and were not significantly different from either group.   For state anxiety \nscores, Tukey\u2019s test revealed that the non anxious group were significantly different to \nboth the computer anxious and the participants with spider phobia.   These two latter \ngroups did not differ from each other. \n \nAnxiety, avoidance and distress: spiders and computers \nScores derived from the visual analogue scales were subjected to one way analyses of \nvariance. There was a significant between group difference on anxiety scores \n(F2,168=171.07, p<.0001), on avoidance scores (F2,167=101.79, p<.0001) and distress \nscores (F2,167=47.34, p<.0001. Tukey\u2019s test revealed that the difference in anxiety and \ndistress scores was between the non-anxious group, and both the spider phobic and \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 13\ncomputer anxious groups, who did not differ from each other.  The specific avoidance \nscores differed in that all groups were significantly different to each other, with spider \nphobic participants expressing higher levels of avoidance (of spiders) than computer \nanxious participants (of computers), who in turn were more avoidant than the non-\nanxious (of computers). \nTable 1 shows means of measures of state and trait anxiety, phobic anxiety and phobic \navoidance in the 3 groups \u2013 in the spider phobics this is related to spiders, in the other \ntwo groups to computers.  Note that higher state and trait anxiety scores, indicate the \nmore anxiety, where the specific anxiety scores run the other way, so that lower scores \ndenote higher anxiety and avoidance. \n \n \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \n \nBelief Scores \nIn order to examine the hypothesis that computer anxious people would endorse negative \nbeliefs about computers at a level similar to those found in spider phobia, the number of \npeople endorsing beliefs at this level (in line with Thorpe & Salkovskis 1995) was \ncalculated for each group (non-anxious, computer anxious and spider phobic).  Compared \nto the non-anxious group, a relatively high number of those in the computer anxious \ngroup appear to have comparatively high levels of belief that harm will ensue in the \npresence of computers.  Figure 1 shows the percentage of computer anxious participants \nwho endorsed beliefs held at a phobic level (in line with Thorpe & Salkovskis, 1995), \ncompared with participants in the non computer anxious and spider phobia groups.   \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 14\nHowever, those with spider phobia also endorsed the following beliefs - more specifically \nconcerning the possibility of physical harm - which did not figure in the computer \nanxious group.  These were: I would come to physical harm; go mad; feel faint; lose \ncontrol of myself; be paralysed; be hysterical; be unable to escape; have a heart attack; \nscream.  It appears that though some core beliefs are shared, they are not those most \ncentral to the experience of specific phobia, as discussed by Thorpe and Salkovskis \n(1995).  As a final check on the utility of examining computer anxiety in relation to \nsocial\/performance anxiety, scores of the computer anxious and spider phobic \nparticipants were compared on a single item from the beliefs scale possibly relevant to \nfear of judgement in the social realm: \u2018I would find someone to help\u2019.  Spider phobic \nparticipants were significantly more likely to find someone to help than were the \ncomputer anxious  (T1,70=-2.903. p=.005).   \n \n \n \nInsert Figure1 about here \n \n \n \n \nStudy 2 \nThe identifying of avoidance and distress in addition to social aspects as salient factors in \nthe experience of anxiety, mirrors research that has been conducted within the social \nanxiety literature. In the light of the findings from study 1, study 2 was designed to \naddress the question as to whether the beliefs held by those afraid of computers were \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 15\nmore akin to those found in social anxiety, performance anxiety or test anxiety than to \nthose found in specific phobia. \n \nMethod \nParticipants. \n164 volunteers took part in this study as part of a research participation scheme, of whom \n129 were female and 35 male, with a mean age of  22.15 (range 18 to 43, sd 5.66).  All \nwere university students.  \n \nMaterials \n1. Demographic details questionnaire, collecting data about age, sex, extent of \nprevious computing experience (a little experience, a medium amount of \nexperience, a lot of experience) and how confident they felt about using \ncomputers. \n2. Visual analogue Likert-type scales containing six items rated on a scale of 0 to \n100 where the anchors were \u2018strongly agree\u2019 and \u2018strongly disagree\u2019.  Statements \nwere as follows: \u2018I always feel anxious when using computers\u2019; \u2018I go out of my \nway to avoid computers\u2019; \u2018It is easy for me to use computers\u2019; \u2018It is important for \nme to be able to use computers\u2019; \u2018My anxiety about computers bothers me\u2019; \u2018I am \nmore anxious about computers than I should be\u2019. Factor analysis of these items \nreveals 2 factors: Computer anxiety (5 items) and Importance (1 item) (Brosnan & \nRosen, submitted). \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 16\n3. Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) (Leibowitz, 1987).  24 items evaluating \nsituations which are difficult for individuals with social phobia.  11 items are \nconcerned with performance anxiety and 13 items with social situations.  Each \nitem is rated separately for fear (0-3 none, mild, moderate, severe) and avoidance \n(0-3 never, occasionally, often, usually) which together provide scores on 4 \nsubscales: performance fear and avoidance, and social fear and avoidance.  The \nscale has good psychometric properties.  \n4. Phobic beliefs scale (Thorpe & Salkovskis 1995).  See above for details. \n5. Test Anxiety Questionnaire (TAQ)  Nist & Diehl (1994).  This is a short, freely \navailable and widely used questionnaire which consists of ten statements \nspecifically related to test-taking such as \u2019I feel nauseated before a test\u2019, \u2018I panic \nbefore and during a test\u2019, \u2018I remember answers that I blanked on once I get out of \nthe testing situation\u2019.  Its psychometric properties have not yet been established. \n \nResults \nOverview \nDemographic details relating to sex, amount of experience with computers and \nconfidence in competence were explored.  Following this, the relationship between \nmeasures of beliefs about harm, coping and disgust, social anxiety and test anxiety were \nexplored using the correlational method.  Finally, multiple regression analyses examined \nthe relative contribution of a variety of factors concerning social and performance anxiety \nto measures of computer anxiety. \n  \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 17\nGender Differences \nAmount of computing experience and confidence in competence were explored.  No \ndifferences were found between the sexes on amount of experience ( t<1) or confidence  \n(t<1).   \n \nAnxiety, avoidance, distress and beliefs. \nFirst, the relationship between scores on the visual analogue scales was explored in \nrelation to global measures of social anxiety and avoidance, and performance anxiety and \navoidance (as measured by the LSAS) and test anxiety (as measured by the TAQ).   \nOverall these scales correlated with all the computer anxiety items but not the importance \nitem.  Additionally, test anxiety showed no relationship with computer avoidance.  \n \n \n \nInsert Table 2 about here \n \n \n \nBeliefs \nNext, the relative contribution of the different subscales of the LSAS (performance fear \nor avoidance and social fear or avoidance),  of the TAQ, and of harm and coping \ncognitions, to computer anxiety, avoidance and distress (as measured by the visual \nanalogue scales pertaining to \u2018my anxiety about computers bothers me\u2019 and \u2018I am more \nanxious about computers than I should be\u2019) were examined using a stepwise multiple \nregression.  Very few of the variables had any specifically explicative value.  \nPerformance fear entered into only one of the models (concerning computer anxiety), \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 18\nsocial fear only enters two of the models (concerning the variables \u2018anxiety about \ncomputers bothers me\u2019 and \u2018more anxious about computers than I should be\u2019) and test \nanxiety does not enter into any of the models.  Beliefs concerning coping and harm \nappear to be of some importance in predicting the strength of the targeted variables but \nthe amount of variance accounted for varies between 25% and 40%.  Results are shown \nin Table 3. \n \n \n \nInsert Table 3 about here \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe aim of the present study was twofold: to explore the possibility that computer anxiety \nwould be present in levels similar to those found in specific phobia and would reach \nDSM IV criteria for specific phobia: and having found some evidence to suggest that \ncomputer anxiety was akin to social anxiety, the second aim was then to explore the \nhypothesis that computer anxiety would be related to social\/performance\/test anxiety.   \nResults provide tentative support for the claim that computer anxiety could reach clinical \nlevels, that some computer anxious beliefs\/cognitions are held in common and at \ncomparable levels to the cognitions of those suffering from a phobia conforming to DSM \nIV criteria, and that a case may be made for computer anxiety to enter into the framework \nof problematic fears.  The scores of spider phobic and computer anxious groups were \nsimilar in respect of computer anxiety and distress, though spider phobics showed a \nsignificantly higher level of avoidance of their phobic object than did computer anxious \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 19\nparticipants.  However, several of the cognitions core to the experience of (in this case) \nspider phobia (I would come to physical harm; go mad; feel faint; lose control of myself; \nbe paralysed and so on) were not found in the computer anxious participants.  \nExamination of individual cognitions revealed that the kinds of concerns being expressed \nwere more akin to those commonly associated with social or performance anxiety  (\u2018I \nwould make a fool of myself\u2019) than to specific phobia (\u2018I would scream\u2019, \u2018I would \nbecome hysterical\u2019).   In further support of this claim, George and Camarata (1996), in an \nexamination of anxiety in teaching staff who were required to use computing, suggest \n\"the cyberanxious instructor who seeks isolation from the group is not rejecting the \nlearning or even the technology, but rather more than likely attempting to avoid the \nscrutiny and possible disapproval of (presumably more informed\/experienced) peers and \nstudents alike.\" (p49). \nFollowing on from this, the second study explored the relationship between the six \nmeasures of computer anxiety, social anxiety\/avoidance, and test anxiety.  Social and \nperformance anxiety and avoidance were significantly related to all the measures of \ncomputer anxiety, but not to whether or not the use of a computer held any importance \nfor the respondent.  Test anxiety was not significantly related to this variable also, and in \naddition was not related to the measure of computer avoidance. \nThe relative contribution of beliefs, social fear, social avoidance, performance fear, \nperformance avoidance and test anxiety to measures of specific computer anxiety, \navoidance and distress was investigated using multiple regression.  This revealed that of \nall the possible variables, beliefs concerning (in)ability to cope were most central to the \nexperience of computer anxiety, while social fear, performance fear and beliefs relating \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 20\nto harm were differentially important to the amount of anxiety, avoidance and distress \nexperienced. It may be that in the pantheon of phobias, computer anxiety (at a phobic \nlevel) may be best understood under the aegis of social, rather than specific, phobia, \nsharing as it does some concerns particular to that disorder (Clark and Wells  1995).   \nSo the perception of ability to stay calm, feel at ease and be able to cope with a situation \nrather than anything inherently threatening in the situation itself seems to be implicated in \nthe framework of computer anxiety.  According to Beck (1976) the perceived ability to \ncope multiplied by rescue factors mediates the amount of distress and perception of \ndanger in the formation of anxiety.  It is therefore of interest to note that computer \nanxiety seems to be somewhat dependant on the individual\u2019s perception of their ability to \ncope.  \nThis study is exploratory and suffers from limitations, the most obvious of which are the \nscales used to differentiate computer anxious people from non anxious people, which - \nthough derived from DSM IV criteria - are no substitute for a diagnostic interview.  \nThese scales also suffered by being marginally different in their wording depending on \nwhether they were being addressed to participants with spider phobia or with computer \nanxiety.  The renders them open to criticism as statistically comparable for the two \ngroups.   \nThe question also remains as to whether this problem will remain one worthy of study, as \ncomputers (and other types of technology) become ever more ubiquitous.  As children \nbegin to use new technologies from the beginning, will this problem naturally fade along \nwith universal usage?  The evidence suggests that it will not: young children today report \nsimilar levels of computer anxiety (Brosnan, 1998d, 1999b): after all, despite universal \nDoes  computer anxiety reach phobic levels? \n 21\neducation and the omnipresence of the written word, illiteracy rates remained at around \n4.8% in the USA as recently as 1973 (Vogt,1973). The evidence from research in social \nphobia suggests that computer anxiety will remain a problem in a small minority, but for \nthis subgroup the fear will be disadvantageous in a similar way to those who are afraid of \nwriting in public, or who cannot read and are afraid of beginning to try (e.g. Johnson, \nShenoy, & Gilmore, 1982; Martin 1997).  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbdelhamid, I.S.
