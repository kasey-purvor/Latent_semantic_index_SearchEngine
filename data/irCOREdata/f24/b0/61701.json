Introduction \nNematodes are dominant components of Antarctic soil food webs. Not only are they abundant, with up \nto 106 individuals present per m2 of soils in the Maritime Antarctic [11], but they also play important \necological roles in these soils by acting as consumers, typically of bacterial prey, and also as predators \nof other nematodes, rotifers and protozoa [21]. Furthermore, nematodes are the top predators in what \nare thought to be the simplest soil food webs encountered on Earth, those occurring in the McMurdo \nDry Valleys of Continental Antarctica [7]. Previous studies have concentrated on Antarctic nematode \ntaxonomy, ecophysiology and biogeography [2,7,10,11,15,26]. However, despite their potentially large \necological influence, little is known of the feeding preferences of Antarctic soil nematodes [11]. Direct \nobservations suggest that a species of Mesodorylaimus at Signy Island in the Maritime Antarctic may \nfeed upon coccoid algae and dead collembola [21]. Coomansus gerlachei has also been shown to feed \nupon algae, fungal hyphae and spores, arthropods, rotifers and tardigrades in Signy Island soil [21]. \nFurthermore, laboratory studies have shown that a yeast and bacteria isolated from the McMurdo Dry \nValleys support the growth of Scottnema lindsayae Timm. extracted from the same habitat [14]. \nHowever this is the only information available on the specific feeding preferences of Antarctic soil \nnematodes.       \nHere we report a study which aimed to determine the preferences of the three most abundant \nsoil nematode taxa at Signy Island, viz. Geomonhystera villosa (B\u00fctschli) Andr\u00e1ssy, Plectus spp. and \nTeratocephalus spp., for 11 microbes, each isolated from Signy Island soil. These nematodes are \ncurrently classified as microbivores and are assumed to feed predominantly on bacteria, although their \ndiet might potentially include algae and filamentous fungi [21]. We also tested for significant \ndifferences between nematodes\u2019 preferences for microbes to assess whether apparently simple \nAntarctic soil food webs consist of complex patterns of trophic interactions.  \n \n2. Methods \n2.1. Extraction of nematodes \nNematodes were extracted from turves of the moss Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske ex Nitardy \ncollected from 100 m to the east of the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s research station on Signy Island (60\u00ba \n42\u2019 34\u201d S, 45\u00ba 35\u2019 36\u201d W) in austral summer 2001. The moss was frozen at -20 \u00baC shortly after \ncollection and was transported to the UK. Small (c. 5 g fresh weight) pieces of frozen moss were placed \n 3 \nonto muslin resting on a 2 mm rigid mesh in the mouth of a plastic funnel held by a retort stand. A \nplastic tube attached to the funnel\u2019s spout was blocked with a clip and spring water was added to the \nfunnel until a thin layer covered the moss. Nematodes that passed through the muslin were collected \nafter 24 h by releasing the clip. They were sorted under a dissecting microscope (6-50 x magnification) \ninto G. villosa, Plectus spp. (typically P. antarcticus de Man) and Teratocephalus spp. (typically T. \ntilbrooki Maslen) and were stored in spring water at 4 \u00baC for a maximum of 3 d until required for \nexperiments.  \n \n2.2. Isolation of microbes from soil \nMicrobes were isolated from soil under S. uncinata taken from the same location at which moss was \ncollected for nematode extraction. Microalgae were isolated on Bold\u2019s Basal (BB) medium (Sigma-\nAldrich, St Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Dilution series of 1 g (fresh weight) of soil were prepared in sterile 10 \nmM phosphate buffer, 100 \u03bcl aliquots of the 10-4 dilution were spread onto BB medium in 90 mm \nsingle vented Petri dishes and the dishes were incubated in the light at c. 4 \u00baC. A single colony of the \nalga Stichococcus bacillaris Nag., and two separate colonies of the alga Chlorella cf. minutissima, were \nisolated onto BB medium after 28 d and were kept in the light at 4 \u00baC until required for experiments. \nAlgal isolates were free of bacteria. The shapes and dimensions of each alga are shown in Table 1. \nMicrofungi were isolated by a modification of the Warcup soil plate method [24]. Briefly, \nsmall volumes of soil (c. 5 mg fresh weight) were placed into non-vented 90 mm Petri dishes, cooled \nbroad-spectrum Czapek-Dox agar medium was placed onto the soil and the dishes were incubated at 4 \n\u00baC for 21 d. Single colonies of the three commonest fungi, Mortierella hyalina (Harz) W. Gams, \nPenicillium aurantiogriseum Dierckx. and Trichoderma viride Pers.: Fr., were isolated onto potato \ndextrose agar medium and kept at 4 \u00baC until required for experiments. The shapes and dimensions of \nthe conidia of each fungus are shown in Table 1. \nBacteria were isolated on R2A (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, U.K.), a broad spectrum \nbacteriological agar medium. Dilution series of soil were prepared as for algae, and 100 \u03bcl aliquots of \nthe 10-4 dilution were spread onto the medium in 90 mm single vented Petri dishes. The dishes were \nincubated in the dark at 4 \u00baC and individual colonies of the commonest six morphotypes of bacteria \nwere isolated onto R2A medium after 28 d. \n \n 4 \n2.3. Taxonomic placement of bacteria \nBacteria were taxonomically placed by comparing 16S rRNA sequences with those in a public access \ndatabase. A single colony of each isolate was placed in 50 \u03bcl of sterile water. Cells were then vortexed \nand subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles (-80 \u00baC and 80 \u00baC, each for 2 min).  The resulting supernatant \nwas cleaned for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with GFX DNA purification columns \n(Amersham Biosciences U.K. Ltd., Chalfont St Giles, U.K.). \nPCR amplification was performed using 43 \u03bcl of ABgene 1.1x ReddyMix PCR Master Mix \n(ABgene, Epsom, U.K.) with 20 pmole of each primer and c. 10 ng of template DNA in a final volume \nof 50 \u03bcl.  The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 95 \u00baC for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 \u00baC for 1 \nmin, 56 \u00baC for 1 min, 72 \u00baC for 70 sec and a final extension step of 72 \u00baC for 10 min. Bacterial rDNA \nwas targeted with the primers 8F (5\u2019-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3\u2019) [6] and 1500R (5\u2019-\nAGAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3\u2019) [4].  PCR products were purified using GFX DNA purification \ncolumns and sequenced. Sequence reactions were run on a Megabace 500 sequencer (Amersham \nBiosciences U.K. Ltd.) using the 8F primer. Nucleotide sequences obtained from the bacteria have been \ndeposited in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence database (http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/embl). The accession \nnumbers of the deposited sequences are AJ557831, AJ557832, AJ557833, AJ557834, AJ557835 and \nAJ557836. The bacteria from which these sequences were obtained are hereafter referred to as B1, B3, \nB6, B7, B9 and B16, respectively. The closest phylogenetic affiliations of the bacteria to named species \nor genera in the EMBL database are shown in Table 1, along with cell shapes and dimensions.  \n \n2.4. Preference experiment \nNematodes were offered a choice of microbes in a \u2018cafeteria\u2019 design [23] on lake water agar (LWA) \nmedium. The medium consisted of 0.2 \u03bcm-filtered water from an oligotrophic lake at Signy Island, \n0.5% technical agar (agar no.3, Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, U.K.) and 50 \u03bcg ml-1 of the bacteriostatin \nampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, U.K.). Preliminary experiments indicated that ampicillin added \nto the LWA medium reduced bacterial growth on its surface and improved attraction of nematodes to \nmicrobial prey offered within the cafeteria design, relative to LWA medium without ampicillin. These \nexperiments also indicated that the inclusion of ampicillin in the medium was more effective at \nreducing bacterial growth than rinsing nematodes in bacteriostatin solution prior to preference \nexperiments [12]. With the regular addition of bacteria to cultures, nematodes could be kept for at least \n 5 \nfour weeks on LWA medium to which ampicillin had been added without showing altered behaviour, \nreproduction or mortality. The LWA medium was poured to a depth of 1.5 mm into 48 single-vented \n90 mm Petri dishes. After the layer of LWA medium had solidified, six sterile plastic cylinders of 12 \nmm diameter and 15 mm length were placed vertically and equidistantly onto the medium under a \nsterile hood. The centre of each disk was 30 mm from the centre of the Petri dish. A second layer of \nLWA medium was then gently poured to a depth of 5 mm. After this layer of medium had solidified the \nplastic cylinders were removed, leaving six wells of 12 mm diameter and 5 mm depth in the LWA \nmedium (Fig. 1 a). \nThree alternate wells in each Petri dish were plugged with 12 mm diameter and c. 4.5 mm \nthick discs of R2A medium. These wells are hereafter referred to as control wells. The remaining three \nwells were plugged with discs of R2A medium (Fig. 1 b), of the same dimensions as those in control \nwells, on which microbes had been grown for 7 d in the light at 15 \u00baC. Twelve Petri dishes received \nalternate plugs inoculated with C. minutissima strains 1 and 2 and S. bacillaris, 12 dishes received \nalternate plugs inoculated with M. hyalina, P. aurantiogriseum and T. viride, 12 dishes received \nalternate plugs inoculated with B1, B3 and B6, and a further 12 dishes received alternate plugs \ninoculated with B7, B9 and B16. Hyphae and conidia were present on the plugs of medium on which \nfungi were grown. The total volumes of cells offered to nematodes, estimated from the product of the \nmean volume of each cell (calculated from standard geometric formulae, assuming right circular \ncylinders for rods and spheres for cocci) and the mean number of cells per unit area of medium from \nwhich plugs were cut, did not differ within each of the three groups of microbes (all P>0.05). There \nwas also no difference between the total cell volumes \u00b1 s.e.m. of algae and bacteria in each well (29.5 \n 107 \u00b1 1.8 x 107 \u03bcm3 and 21.2 x 107 \u00b1 1.8  107 \u03bcm3, respectively; P>0.05). However, the mean \nvolume \u00b1 s.e.m. of fungal hyphae and conidia (c. 7.4 x 107 \u00b1 1.2 x 107 \u03bcm3) in each well was \nsignificantly lower than the volumes of algal and bacterial cells presented to nematodes (P<0.01). \nAfter the plugs of medium had been added to each of the 48 dishes, the LWA medium was \ngently flooded with a c. 1 mm deep layer of 0.2 \u03bcm-filtered lake water to ensure that less motile \nnematodes could move across the agar medium surface. The tops of the R2A medium plugs were c. 0.5 \nmm lower than the level of LWA medium in each Petri dish, ensuring that excess microbial cells did \nnot distribute across the surface of the medium when the layer of lake water was added. Groups of 50 \nadult G. villosa, Plectus spp. or Teratocephalus spp. of similar size, each of which had been washed in \n 6 \nthree changes of sterile lake water, were pipetted into the water at the centre of each of four Petri dishes \ncontaining plugs of R2A agar medium inoculated with either algae, fungi or one of the two \ncombinations of bacteria. The dishes were incubated in the dark at 15 \u00baC to ensure rapid movement of \nnematodes towards microbial prey [12]. Nematodes in each well were counted at 24 and 48 h with a \nstereomicroscope (6-50 x magnification). The dishes were handled carefully to avoid displacement of \nnematodes from the wells. \n \n2.5. Ingestion of fluorescent beads \nWhen the preference experiment indicated significant attraction of nematodes to microbes, experiments \nusing fluorescent beads were performed to test for increased ingestion by nematodes in the presence of \nprey. Spring water (0.2 \u03bcm-filtered) was added to a depth of 1 mm to colonies of the appropriate \nmicrobes growing on R2A medium and the surfaces of the colonies were gently rubbed with a sterile \nglass spreader. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the water, containing c. 2.5 x 106 algal and bacterial cells and c. 1.2 \nx 106 fungal conidia, were dispensed into tissue culture plate wells and 2 \u03bcl of a suspension of \nTetraspeck fluorescent beads (0.5 \u03bcm diameter; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, U.S.A.), with \nrespective excitation and emission maxima at 505 and 515 nm, was added to each well. Controls \nconsisted of 0.5 ml of 0.2 \u03bcm-filtered spring water, taken from the surface of uninoculated R2A \nmedium, with 2 \u03bcl of fluorescent beads suspension. Treatment and control wells each received c. 3 x \n106 beads. Individual nematodes were introduced into each of 10 control and treatment wells and the \ntissue culture plates were incubated in the dark at 15 \u00baC. The number of fluorescent beads ingested by \neach nematode was counted after 24 h using epifluorescence at 1000 x magnification. \n \n2.6. Statistical analyses \nOne way ANOVA was used to compare (i) the numbers of nematodes remaining on the agar medium \nsurface with those accumulated in control wells and wells containing microbial prey and (ii) the \nnumbers of nematodes accumulated in control wells with those accumulated in wells containing \nmicrobial prey. Control values entered into the latter analyses were the mean numbers of nematodes in \nthe two control wells either side of each replicate well containing the appropriate microbial prey. \nRepeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the main effects of time, and the main and \ninteractive effects of prey type and nematode genus or species, on nematode accumulation in wells. \n 7 \nControl values were eliminated from these analyses. One way ANOVA was also used to compare the \nnumbers of fluorescent beads accumulated in the guts of nematodes in the presence of microbial prey \nwith the numbers accumulated in the guts of nematodes in water controls. \n             \n3. Results \n3.1. Responses to time \nNo main effect of time was found on the numbers of nematodes accumulated in wells containing \nmicrobial prey (Table 2): numbers of nematodes in the wells remained the same at 24 and 48 h.  \n \n3.2. Responses to algae \nSignificantly more nematodes remained on the LWA medium surface than accumulated in control \nwells and wells containing algae (mean numbers per dish = 35.4 and 14.6, respectively; P<0.001). \nHowever, there was a strong main effect of algae on nematode accumulation in wells (Table 2): more \nnematodes accumulated in wells containing C. minutissima strain 2 than in wells containing C. \nminutissima strain 1 or S. bacillaris (mean numbers per well \u00b1 s.e.m. = 4.5 \u00b1 0.7, 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 and 2.6 \u00b1 \n0.4, respectively). There was also a highly significant main effect of nematode genus on the numbers of \nnematodes accumulated in wells containing algae (Table 2): G. villosa was more frequently recorded in \nalgal wells than Plectus spp. or Teratocephalus spp. (mean numbers per well \u00b1 s.e.m. = 4.8 \u00b1 0.7, 2.5 \u00b1 \n0.3 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.3, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significant interactive effect of alga and \nnematode genus on the numbers of nematodes accumulated in wells (Table 2): there were significant \ndifferences between nematode genera in the isolates of algae that they were attracted to. \nA comparison of the mean numbers of nematodes accumulated in wells containing individual \nalgae with those in adjacent control wells indicated significant attraction to two algal isolates. G. \nvillosa was significantly attracted to C. minutissima strain 2 and Plectus spp. were attracted to S. \nbacillaris (Fig. 2 a, b). However only G. villosa ingested a significantly greater number of fluorescent \nbeads in the presence of algal cells compared with water controls (Fig. 2 a, inset): Plectus spp. did not \ningest more beads when presented with S. bacillaris (Fig. 2 b, inset). \n 8 \n \n3.3. Responses to fungi \nSignificantly more nematodes remained on the LWA medium surface than accumulated in control \nwells and wells containing fungi (mean numbers per dish = 38.3 and 11.7, respectively; P<0.001). \nThere was also no main effect of different fungi on nematode accumulation in wells (Table 2). \nHowever there was a strong main effect of nematode genus on the numbers of nematodes accumulated \nin wells containing fungi (Table 2): more G. villosa individuals were attracted to wells containing fungi \nthan either Plectus spp. or Teratocephalus spp. (mean numbers per well \u00b1 s.e.m. = 4.0 \u00b1 0.6, 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 \nand 1.0 \u00b1 0.2, respectively). There was no interactive effect of fungus and nematode genus on the \nnumbers of nematodes accumulated in wells containing fungi (Table 2). Only one significant trophic \nlink between nematodes and fungi was recorded: G. villosa was significantly attracted to M. hyalina \n(Fig. 2 c) and ingested a greater number of fluorescent beads compared with controls when presented \nwith conidia of the fungus (Fig. 2 c, inset). \n \n3.4. Responses to bacteria \nThere was no difference between the numbers of nematodes remaining on the LWA medium surface \nand those accumulated in control wells and wells containing bacteria (mean numbers per dish = 28.0 \nand 22.0, respectively, P>0.05). There were no significant main effects of bacterium or nematode \ngenus on the accumulation of nematodes in wells (Table 2). However, there was a strong interactive \neffect of bacteria and nematode genus on nematode accumulation in wells (Table 2): there were \nsignificant differences between nematode genera in the isolates of bacteria that they were attracted to. \n A comparison of the numbers of nematodes accumulated in wells containing individual \nbacteria with those accumulated in adjacent control wells indicated that both G. villosa and \nTeratocephalus spp. were attracted to B16 (Fig. 2 d, e). Both of these nematodes ingested more \nfluorescent beads in the presence of B16 than in their absence (Fig. 2 d, e insets). Higher numbers of \nPlectus spp. accumulated in wells containing B3, B7 and B9 than accumulated in control wells (Fig. 2 \nf-h) and more fluorescent beads were ingested by Plectus spp. in the presence of these bacteria than in \ntheir absence (Fig. 2 f-h, insets). \n \n \n 9 \n4. Discussion \nOur experiments indicated significant differences between nematodes in the algal and bacterial prey \nthat they were attracted to. The finding that Antarctic soil nematodes exhibited differing preferences for \nmicrobial prey is an important observation because it suggests that they are apparently not generalist \nfeeders, as has been previously assumed [21]. Selective, rather than generalist, feeding by nematodes \non microbial prey may have important implications for analysing the flow of energy through soil food \nwebs, particularly if microbivorous nematodes do not specifically feed on bacteria or fungi, as has been \nassumed in previous work [14]. Furthermore, selective feeding by nematodes on microbial prey may \nalter the outcome of interspecific competition between microbes and potentially has implications for \ndetermining microbial distribution in soil. Differing preferences for microbial prey have similarly been \nshown in marine ecosystems, in which different nematode species have been shown to exhibit selective \npreferences for distinct diatoms and bacteria [12,23]. These differences in the attraction of nematodes \nto distinct microbial species, and, in the case of Geomonhystera in the current study, to specific strains \nof microbes, are likely to be owing to chemotaxis towards different types or concentrations of water-\nsoluble compounds produced by microbes, such as cyclic nucleotides or ammonia [3,25].  \nThe laboratory-based approach taken in this study was necessary to determine trophic \ninteractions between members of a soil microbial food web. However the artificial nature of the \nexperiments probably influenced nematode response to microbial prey. For example, the use of a two-\ndimensional agar medium surface on which to offer prey to nematodes may have influenced their \nbehaviour, relative to the three dimensional matrix in which they locate prey in the natural environment \n[1]. The growth of prey on a relatively nutrient-rich medium is also likely to have altered their \nattractiveness to nematodes, relative to prey growing in nutrient-limited conditions in soil. \nFurthermore, a relatively high temperature (15 \u00baC) was used in our experiments to ensure rapid \nmovement of nematodes towards microbial prey. This temperature is regularly experienced by \norganisms inhabiting the upper layers of Antarctic soils during cloudless periods in summer, but does \nnot persist for more than a few hours each day [9]. A previous study has, however, found that \ntemperature does not influence nematode preference for different microbial prey [23].  \nAnother artificial aspect of our study was the inclusion of a bacteriostatin in the agar medium \nused in the preference experiment. It was necessary to use the bacteriostatin because bacterial \ncontaminants present on the surfaces of nematodes, which had been extracted directly from field-\n 10 \ncollected material, grew on the agar medium and reduced the attraction of nematodes to microbes in \nwells. Previous studies [12,23] have not adopted this approach, probably because nematodes were \nextracted from long-term gnotobiotic cultures fed on specific strains of bacteria or diatoms, reducing \nthe numbers of contaminants present on nematodes. However, we were unable to adopt this approach \nin our experiments: although we have developed cultures of Plectus spp. from Signy Island soil, we \nhave failed to develop either G. villosa or Teratocephalus spp. cultures, despite repeated attempts to do \nso.  \nDespite the artificial experimental conditions used in our study, common elements of the \nmicrobial food web present in Signy Island soil were used in the experiments. Previous work has found \n70% of nematodes extracted from moss at the island to consist of G. villosa and species of Plectus and \nTeratocephalus [11]. Furthermore, the microbial prey presented to nematodes in our study are \ncommonly present in the natural environment. For example, S. bacillaris, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, \nChlorella and Mortierella spp. are all frequently isolated from Signy Island soils [5,8]. S. bacillaris, \nChlorella and Mortierella spp. are also common representatives of eukaryotic rDNA clone libraries \nconstructed from Signy Island soil (B. Lawley, pers. comm.). In addition, the numbers of microbial \ncells offered to nematodes in our study were similar to those encountered in the field: algal and \nbacterial cell counts at soil surfaces range from 1 x 103 to 8.5 x 106 cm-2 and 4 x 109 to 3 x 1010 cm-2, \nrespectively [5,20], which broadly correspond to the mean numbers of cells of these microbes \npresented to nematodes in our study (1.1 x 107 and 7.0 x 108 cm-2, respectively). \nOur data in part confirm current views on the feeding habits of Antarctic nematodes. Plectus \nspp. and Teratocephalus spp. are typically classified as bacterial feeders [27] and our study suggested \nthat these nematodes only feed upon bacteria, and not on algae and fungi. However, Geomonhystera \nspp. are classified as bacterial feeders and substrate ingesters [27] and our data indicate that G. villosa \nshould now also be classed as a unicellular eukaryote feeder in the scheme presented by Yeates et al. \n[27]. Given that G. villosa has wider mouthparts than Plectus spp. or Teratocephalus spp. (mean stoma \nwidths of the nematodes are c. 7, 5 and 3 \u03bcm, respectively [2,10]), it is not surprising that it was more \nattracted to algae and fungi than the other two nematodes: with the exception of the bacterium B1, algal \nand fungal cells were larger than the bacteria offered to nematodes.  \nPrevious studies have recorded heterogeneous spatial distributions of nematodes in Antarctic \nsoils [11,18]. The primary factors responsible for these clumped distributions are thought to be \n 11 \nincreased temperature and water availability, which lead to the development of favourable \nmicrohabitats for nematodes in soil [11,18]. However, discrete microhabitats in soils also favour the \ndevelopment of distinct microbial populations, for example by affinities for different organic substrates \n[21]. In agreement with previous studies [11,16,18,19], our data therefore suggest that attraction to \ndifferent populations of microbial prey present in discrete microhabitats may be a potentially important \nfactor governing the heterogeneous distribution of nematodes in Antarctic soils.  \n Our observation that nematodes exhibited differing preferences for microbial prey suggests \nthat complex trophic interactions may exist in apparently simple Antarctic soil food webs. This \nobservation has potentially important implications for predicting the responses of these food webs to \nimminent climate change. The simplicity of food webs in Antarctic soils, and particularly those of \nContinental Antarctica, is thought to increase their vulnerability to environmental change [7]. However, \ngiven the strong theoretical link between resilience to perturbation and food web complexity, and in \nparticular connectance [17], the finding that these food webs may exhibit reduced connectance is likely \nto influence their response to environmental change. At present it is not possible to accurately predict \nwhether low connectance within Antarctic soil food webs increases or decreases their resilience to \nperturbation. This question, and the influence of other aspects of food web architecture on the response \nof model Antarctic food webs to environmental change, is a focus for ongoing research in our \nlaboratory. \n \nAcknowledgements \nFunding from the Natural Environment Research Council through the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s \nTerrestrial and Freshwater Biodiversity project is gratefully acknowledged.
