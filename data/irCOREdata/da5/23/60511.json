Along with datasets from several \nother observatories, this provides an excellent resource for understanding the electromagnetic \nenvironment in this region of the world. One feature of particular interest is the South Atlantic \nAnomaly (SAA), an area where the radiation hazard from high proton fluxes and cosmic rays is \nhigh due to the relatively low shielding effect provided by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. In this area, \nfor example, a significantly higher number of so-called single event upsets (SEUs) occur in low \nearth-orbiting satellites (Heirtzler, 2002). This area is related to a region of reverse flux at the core \nmantle boundary beneath the south Atlantic where the magnetic field is directed into the core \nrather than out, as it is elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Gubbins and Bloxham, 1985). The \napparent growth of this reversed flux region over the last hundred years or so (Jackson et al, 2000) \nmay be related to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field attempting to reverse (Gubbins, 2008). \n \nIn this paper we describe our experience of operating Ascension and Port Stanley observatories \nand the difficulties encountered in doing this remotely from the UK. Using data from these \nobservatories and others in the area which have been running for several decades, and repeat \nstation observations, we then look at how the SAA is evolving in space and in time.  \n \nWe then investigate the hypothesis that the SAA, and any long-term changes in it, have an impact \non the processes which generate external field variations. First, we investigate whether the growth \nof the reverse flux patch at the core-mantle boundary in the south Atlantic influences the irregular \nexternal magnetic fields observed in this part of the world (as opposed to the regular diurnal \nvariation). We describe an analysis involving hourly standard deviations computed from one-\nminute data recorded at a number of observatories operating inside and outside the SAA area. We \nthen look at the high frequency end of the spectrum, analysing pulsation signals from \nobservatories inside and outside the SAA. \n \nAscension and Port Stanley operational experiences \n \nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) has operated magnetic observatories on Ascension Island \n(ASC) and the Falkland Islands (PST) since 1992 and 1994 respectively. These two remote South \nAtlantic locations were selected to increase the global distribution of continuous, quality vector \nmagnetic data. \n \nUnlike BGS observatories in the United Kingdom, it is not economically feasible to maintain the \nSouth Atlantic observatories as permanently manned stations. Operating an unmanned observatory \ndemands that the instruments, recording facilities and data communications are reliable and cost-\neffective. In addition to instrumental complications, the remoteness and climatic conditions at the \nsites have given rise to a variety of operating problems, adversely affecting the recorded data. \n \nTrained local staff oversee the routine operation of both of the BGS South Atlantic observatories \nand perform a fortnightly (PST) or monthly (ASC) set of absolute observations. Since neither \nobservatory is permanently manned, the selection of a suitable site was heavily dependent on the \navailable infrastructure. As well as cost considerations, sites have been selected based on the \nrequirement for a reliable power source, available data communications and ease of access. In \ngeneral, these criteria are in competition with the requirement to locate at a magnetically clean \nsite, free from potential man-made magnetic interference and, therefore, sites have been selected \nas a compromise between the two. The huts housing the magnetometers at PST are shown in \nFigure 1. \n \n \nFigure 1 The huts housing the magnetometers at Port Stanley \n \nSince neither observatory is located on land owned or controlled by BGS, variometer data have \nfrequently been contaminated by cultural noise. Often this noise is transient (temporary equipment \nor vehicles on site), but there have been instances of permanent interference, such as the \ninstallation of a steel mast at PST in June 1999. By operating both a fluxgate variometer and a \nproton precession magnetometer separated by a few metres, such interference can often be \nidentified. At both observatories the absolute pillar is sited more remotely than the variometer \n(since electrical power is not required at the absolute pillar) and cultural noise can often be \nremoved during post-processing of the variometer baselines. However, both observatories are \nlocated close to telecommunication installations and the instruments are intermittently subject to \nRF interference which can be less predictable in its effect and more difficult to remove. Some \nmeasures to reduce the effect of RF interference have had a degree of success, including shielding \ninstruments and minimising cable lengths. \n \nThe logistics of operating a station remotely also have an effect on the continuity and quality of \nthe data. Whilst absolute observations are made at least monthly, observatory visits by BGS staff \nfor repairs, maintenance and observer training are normally restricted to once per year. The cost of \ntransporting equipment to both sites is also restrictive - heavy items must be shipped by sea, a \nprocess which can take in excess of a month. As a consequence, instrument failures can lead to \nprolonged periods of missing data. \n \nThe upgrade of the communication link to both observatories in 2002 from a uni-directional \nsatellite link to a bi-directional internet link provided a more robust, real-time means of \nmonitoring the instrumentation, allowing faults to be diagnosed and often resolved remotely. This \nled to a significant improvement in the reliability of the data. \n \nPrior to 2007, the fluxgate magnetometers, although insulated, were not maintained in a \ntemperature stabilised environment. Although the insulation attenuated the diurnal temperature \nvariations, the instruments were subject to seasonal temperature fluctuations, with a detrimental \neffect on the ability to maintain accurate baselines. The effect of external temperature variations \non instrument baselines is more prominent in the temperate Falkland Island climate, rather than on \nthe tropical Ascension Island. This problem is exacerbated at PST by the low frequency of \nabsolute observations in the winter months due to the low temperature, strong winds and frequent \nprecipitation. Therefore, temperature control (consisting of additional insulation, a 150 W non-\nmagnetic heater and a proportional temperature controller) was added to the PST instrument \nenclosure in May 2007. The standard deviation in instrument temperature between May-December \n2007 has been improved to 0.3\u00baC compared to 4.0\u00baC for the same period in 2006. \n \nThe frequency of absolute observations from PST has been improved since 2003 with the erection \nof a rudimentary fibre-glass enclosure, although the observatory often suffers from poor visibility \naffecting sighting the fixed mark. \n \nThe Falkland Islands also has a greater incidence of lightning strikes than Ascension Island and \nlightning has resulted in long periods of data loss on a number of occasions. In all cases, damage \nto electronic components has been caused by induced, transient currents in long data and power \ncables between the recording hut and the sensor hut, despite the inclusion of lightning protection \nbarriers. It may be that the addition of large steel masts in close proximity to the instruments has \nincreased the incidence of lightning strikes in recent years. Lightning induced failures have been \neliminated since 2005 when all copper data lines were replaced with fibre-optic ones and the \nprotection provided by the suppressors on the power lines was improved through better earthing. \n \nAscension Island, like many sites in the South Atlantic, is volcanic and magnetically anomalous - \nthe observatory site has gradients in excess of 10 nT\/m in parts. Although not evident in the ASC \ndata, such localised magnetic signals can vary with time, temperature and perturbations such as \nlightning strikes. In high gradient fields, care must be taken to accurately locate absolute observing \ninstruments, to avoid disturbing magnetised material (rocks) and to routinely survey the field \nintensity around the site. At very high gradient sites, it no longer becomes feasible to operate a \nvector observatory as the assumption that the field vectors at the variometer and absolute pillar are \nparallel is no longer valid. Consequently, it is not possible to apply baselines to correct the \nvariometer data to the absolute pillar. \n \nAnalysis of geomagnetic data \n \nThe strength of the internal magnetic field is significantly lower in the south Atlantic compared to \nelsewhere in the world. This is shown in Figure 2 and it can be seen that the SAA is moving \nwestwards and is deepening. From Figure 3 it can be seen that, as a percentage of the full field, the \nrate of change is also quite different in this part of the world. Both the magnitude of the \nconductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field and the mean height of the ionospheric dynamo \nlayer are affected by the field strength, but how this rapid change in an already weak field affects \nthe numbers of SEUs is not yet known. \n \n \nFigure 2 Magnetic field strength (\u03bcT) at 2005.0 and the loci of minima from 1900 from 10th Generation \nInternational Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF-10)  (Maus et al., 2005) \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Change in magnetic field strength 1955.0-2005.0 as percentage of mean field for same period, from \nIGRF-10 \n  \nFigure 4 shows the locations of the observatories and other sites where measurements of the full \nmagnetic field vector have been made. These data are held at the World Data Centre (WDC) for \nGeomagnetism in Edinburgh. The locations selected are those where a magnetic field strength of \nless than 30 \u03bcT has been observed at some time in the past. Along with the polar regions, this \nregion sees many SEUs. \n \n \nFigure 4 Locations of observatories (red circles), repeat stations and survey sites (black triangles) where a total \nintensity of less than 30 \u03bcT has been observed. Field intensity (\u03bcT) for 2005.0 from IGRF-10 also shown. \n \nAnnual means from observatories in this region with long records are plotted in Figure 5. By using \nannual means the most significant (i.e. largest amplitude) fields of external origin (storms, daily, \nseasonal and annual variation) are filtered out: the resulting values mainly represent the field \narising from inside the Earth with a very small component attributable to solar cycle effects on \nfields of external origin. These data would have been used to derive the IGRF depicted in Figures \n2-4 but as some of the series extend further back in time we can see that the decrease in the last 50 \nyears is part of a longer-term decrease in the field strength in this part of the world. The sustained, \nrather high, rate of decrease over South Africa should be noted.  \n \n \nFigure 5 Annual means of total intensity (\u03bcT) at selected long-running observatories in region of SAA. \nLocations of observatories are shown in Figure 4. \n \nTo analyse the irregular external field one needs to use minute mean values or even 1-second \nsamples. Minute mean values are available at the WDC for eight of the thirteen observatories \nshown in Figure 5. One robust, and fairly quick-to-compute, measure of the magnitude of the rapid \nexternal field variations is hourly standard deviation. This measure is also widely used in the study \nof geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) as it is related to the power in the magnetic field \nvariations that drive surface electric fields and GICs (Beamish et al., 2002). However, in order to \ndepict any long-term trends, we take 10-day means (thereby filtering out the diurnal variation) of \nthese ( Figure 6). \n \n \nFigure 6  Ten-day means of hourly standard deviations of total intensity (nT). Note different scale used for \nHUA which is close to dip equator and therefore affected by the equatorial electrojet. Observatories organised \nby |inclination| from left to right, top to bottom. \n \nFrom Figure 6, the solar cycle signal and the enhanced external field level for Huancayo (HUA) \nobservatory near the dip equator are to be noted. No other obvious long-term trends are apparent. \n \nThe same exercise is undertaken for a selection of observatories outwith the SAA area but at \nsimilar (geomagnetic) latitudes to those inside. The selected observatories have magnetic field \nstrength more than 30 \u03bcT but are within the inclination range of those observatories inside the \nSAA, and, additionally, have series of minute means which extend more than 10 years and have a \ngood global coverage. To demonstrate this selection based on inclination and total intensity, and to \nillustrate the asymmetry of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field introduced by the SAA, Figure 7 shows the \nlocus of modelled values (at 2005.0) of inclination and total intensity for the whole of the Earth\u2019s \nsurface and for the observatories used in this study (JCO, LER, ESK and HAD not included in \nminute mean analysis but are shown on this plot because they are used later for comparing \nmicropulsations). \n \n \nFigure 7 Locus of modelled values of inclination and total intensity from the 10th generation IGRF at 2005.0 \nfor the whole of the Earth's surface and for the observatories whose minute means and 1-second values were \nused in this study. Below the 30 \u03bcT line indicates region of the SAA.  If the field was dipolar the locus would be \na parabola \n \nThe effect of high latitude current systems in all selected observatories is assumed to be small. \nTen-day means of hourly standard deviations are plotted in Figure 8. \n  \n \nFigure 8 Ten-day means of hourly standard deviations of F (nT) for observatories outside SAA. Observatories \norganised by |inclination| from left to right, top to bottom. \n \nThe variable solar cycle amplitude can be seen but without more detailed analysis it is not possible \nto say whether there is any \u201clocal\u201d interaction, for example due to the SAA, between the system \ngenerating the external field signals and the internal magnetic field. \n \nBoth inclination and strength of the internal field at the observatories used in this study were \nexpected to have an influence on the amplitudes of the external fields observed, but little \ndiscernible pattern is observed between the general amplitude of the external fields (as determined \nby 10-day means of hourly standard deviations) and long-term means of inclination or total \nintensity.   \n \nFinally we take a detailed look at a single magnetic storm and examine its characteristics using 1-\nsecond data at several observatories including Ascension and Port Stanley. This is possible \nbecause BGS observatories have been routinely collecting 1-second data since 2002. Figure 9 \nshows the filtered (2-1000 s) north and east components at BGS observatories during the 30th \nOctober 2003 \u201cHalloween\u201d magnetic storm. This represents the broadband pulsations. There is a \nrelatively strong 10-20 minute period oscillation observed at PST between 20:30 and 22:30 that is \nnot as clearly seen elsewhere. \n  \nFigure 9 Stack plot of filtered (2-1000 s) north (X, coloured line) and east (Y, black line) BGS observatory \nmeasurements during the 30th October 2003 magnetic storm, for six hours when the 3-hour magnetic activity \nindex ap was sustained at its maximum of 400. Magnetic L-shell (McIlwain, 1961) and local time (LT) are noted \nfor each observatory. Note that 1-second data from the Sable Island observatory were unavailable at this time. \n \nFigure 10 shows filtered (40 \u2013 150 s) data, representing the Pi2 pulsation band. Activity in this \nband occurs in connection with magnetospheric substorms. Note the larger peak amplitude \nobserved at Port Stanley (L = 1.8) compared with Hartland around 20:00 UT, but absence of \nactivity (or at least much reduced activity) from 21:00 \u2013 23:00 at both PST and ASC, both inside \nthe SAA. \n \nFigure 10 Similar to Figure 9 but output from the Pi2 waveband (40-150 s) \n \nTables 1 and 2 list the RMS and peak amplitudes associated with the pulsations during 30th \nOctober 2003 shown in Figures 9 and 10, and compares them with values from a quiet period at \nsame time of day but a few days earlier. \n \n \nObservatory L-Shell \n(Earth Radii) \nActivity \nConditions \nX rms \n(nT) \nY rms \n(nT) \nX peak \n(nT) \nY peak \n(nT) \nStorm 65.8 87.8 304.4 415.5 JCO \nAlaska \n7.6 \nQuiet 5.2 4.1 28.9 16.5 \nStorm 112.0 45.8 949.6 339.3 LER \nScotland \n4.5 \nQuiet 0.4 0.4 2.2 2.9 \nStorm 96.6 70.6 614.2 706.5 ESK \nScotland \n3.5 \nQuiet 0.4 0.3 2.1 1.8 \nStorm 32.2 16.9 231.2 117.2 HAD \nEngland \n2.9 \nQuiet 0.2 0.2 1.1 0.8 \nStorm 12.5 9.0 72.7 51.7 PST Falkland \nIslands \n1.8 \nQuiet 0.2 0.2 1.0 0.9 \nStorm 5.6 2.3 38.6 12.1 ASC \nAscension \n1.001 \nQuiet 0.1 0.1 0.4 0.3 \nTable 1 RMS and peak amplitudes for the six observatory filtered series shown in Figure 9 (18:00 - 00:00 UT on \n30th October 2003, when ap = 400, 400), compared to a quiet period from the same month (18:00 - 00:00 UT on \n27th October 2003, when ap = 5, 4).

This provides some support for the result of Trivedi et al. (2005), who claim extra \nelectron precipitation due to SAA causes enhanced pulsation amplitudes. However what is \ndemonstrated here is that this is the case only sporadically. \n \nConclusions \n \nWith 15 years experience in operating magnetic observatories on Ascension Island and the \nFalkland Islands, it is clear that operating a magnetic observatory at a remote location is \nchallenging both in terms of engineering and logistics. It is also costly in time, money and \nresources, and hence it is not surprising that the distribution of observatories in the South Atlantic \nis sparse or that data from these observatories sometimes contain gaps. Despite this, the success of \nthe BGS observatories has improved markedly over recent years as the points of failure have been \nremoved and better communications and more reliable instrumentation have been put in place.  \n \nThe principal factor, however, in successfully maintaining continuous recordings at the BGS \nobservatories has been to have access to local staff with engineering experience. Although the \nobservatories are monitored from the United Kingdom, they have benefited greatly from the help \nof local engineers who are available to maintain instrumentation should the need arise, as well as \nto make absolute observations. Also, BGS sites have been selected with a preference for reliable \npower supply and bi-directional communications, even if this has been at the expense of some data \nquality. Although this means that the observatories are sited close to other facilities, making use of \nexisting infrastructure to reduce costs, this simplifies installation and improves reliability. \n \nWith regards to the hypothesis that the remarkable changes in the internal magnetic field that have \nbeen seen in the last few decades in the south Atlantic should have an effect on the magnetic fields \ngenerated external to the Earth, we conclude that further analysis is required. At the moment none \nof the datasets are sufficiently long compared to the 11-year solar cycle to allow isolation of any \nsignificant trends. However, the existence of high frequency micropulsation signals at locations \nwhere the magnetic field lines close on the Earth far from the polar areas is unexpected. Clearly \nmore study on this is needed using data during several storms. A polarisation study could also be \nrevealing; it may be that there are different X\/Y phase relationships observed at sites inside and \noutside the SAA. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank all staff involved in the operation of all observatories whose data we have used, and the \nWorld Data Centres for Geomagnetism for collation and distribution of data.
