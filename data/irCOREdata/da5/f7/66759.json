Introduction\nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone is a major, ESE-\ndipping detachment exposed within basement gneisses\nof the Archaean\u2013Palaeoproterozoic Lewisian Complex\nof the Outer Hebridean islands (Fig. 1; Jehu & Craig,\n1925, 1926, 1927, 1934; R. H. Sibson, unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. London, 1977; Sibson, 1977; Lailey, Stein\n& Reston, 1989; Fettes et al. 1992; Butler, Holdsworth\n& Strachan, 1995; MacInnes, Alsop & Oliver, 2000;\nImber et al. 1997, 2001; Osinski, Alsop & Oliver,\n2001). The trace of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone\nruns nearly parallel to the Moine Thrust, the western\nmargin of the Caledonian orogenic belt, which crops\nout c. 85 km to the east on the Scottish mainland (Fig.\n1a). Seismic reflection profiles suggest that the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone dips consistently at c. 25\u00b0 E to SE\ndown into the lower crust, intersecting and possibly\noffsetting the Moho at c. 25 km depth (Smythe et al.\n1982; Peddy, 1984). Interpretations of offshore bore-\nhole and seismic reflection data suggest that the fault\nzone was active during Proterozoic, Carboniferous\nand Mesozoic extension (e.g. Stein, 1988, 1992). The\nexceptional onshore exposure of the Outer Hebrides\nFault Zone probably results from uplift in the footwall\nof the Permo-Triassic Minch Fault (Fig. 1b), com-\nbined with the effects of later regional uplift related to\nunderplating of basalts below this part of northwest\nScotland during the opening of the North Atlantic\n(Brodie & White, 1994; Roberts & Holdsworth, 1999).\nOn the basis of systematic, along-strike variations\nin fault rock distribution, the onshore expression of\nthe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone can be divided into two\ndistinct segments separated by the NW\u2013SE-trending\nSouth Harris Shear Zones (Fig. 1b; Butler,\nHoldsworth & Strachan, 1995; Imber et al. 2001).\nOverprinting relationships between different fault\nrocks and structures exposed along the northern seg-\nment preserve evidence for at least five major fault-\nrelated deformation events. Starting with the oldest\nevent, these are: (1) top-to-the-NW thrusting in a\nbroad (< 6 km thick) mylonitic shear zone; (2) brittle\ntop-to-the-W thrusting producing widespread catacla-\nsite and pseudotachylyte; (3) sinistral top-to-the-NE\nstrike-slip in a network of macroscopically ductile\nphyllonitic shear zones; (4) brittle\u2013ductile top-to-the-\nSE extension focused within and along the margins of\nthe phyllonitic shear zone network; and (5) brittle top-\nto-the-E extension along steeply dipping normal\nfaults. In contrast, four major movement events have\nGeol.

The fault\nzone exhibits a long-lived displacement history and was active during Proterozoic, end-Silurian,\nCarboniferous and Mesozoic times. The earliest deformation event preserved onshore was associated\nwith top-to-the-NW ductile thrusting. A previous study proposed that thrust-related protomylonitic\nand mylonitic fabrics are cross-cut by amphibolites (\u2018Younger Basics\u2019) and Laxfordian granite and\npegmatite sheets. This evidence was used to suggest that ductile thrusting occurred during the\nPalaeoproterozoic Inverian event at c. 2500 Ma. Our observations demonstrate, however, that\nmylonitic fabrics within the ductile thrust zone are superimposed on all components of the gneiss\ncomplex including amphibolites and Laxfordian intrusions. It therefore follows that the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone cannot be older than c. 1685 Ma, the age of recently dated Laxfordian granites in\nthe Outer Hebrides. Geochronological studies have shown that the basement blocks of the northern\nOuter Hebrides and Scottish mainland have different geological histories and were amalgamated dur-\ning Proterozoic times at or after c. 1700 Ma. We propose that early ductile thrusting along the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone formed part of this amalgamation process leading to burial and reheating of the\nfootwall gneisses in Lewis and north Harris. This would account for the c. 1100 Ma thermal event\nrecorded by previous workers and implies that ductile thrusting along the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone\nis of Grenvillian age.\nKeywords: Outer Hebrides, fault zones, Laxfordian, Grenville, reactivation, thrust faults.\n\u2021 Author for correspondence: r.e.holdsworth@durham.ac.uk\nbeen recognized along the southern segment of the\nOuter Hebrides Fault Zone (Butler, Holdsworth &\nStrachan, 1995; Imber et al. 2001). Starting with the\noldest, these are: (1) brittle top-to-the-W thrusting\nproducing widespread cataclasite and pseudotachy-\nlyte; (2) sinistral top-to-the-NE strike-slip in a network\nof macroscopically ductile phyllonitic shear zones; (3)\nbrittle\u2013ductile top-to-the-E extension focused within\nand along the margins of the pre-existing phyllonite\nbelts; and (4) brittle top-to-the-E and -ENE slip along\nsteep to moderately dipping faults. Events 2, 3, 4 and 5\nalong the northern segment have been correlated with\nevents 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the southern Outer Hebrides on\nthe basis of similarities in kinematic history and fault\nrock textures (Butler, Holdsworth & Strachan, 1995;\nImber et al. 2001). This correlation of deformation\nevents is similar to that suggested in the seminal study\nof R. H. Sibson (unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. London,\n1977), although he did not recognize the sinistral dis-\nplacements. Offshore interpretation of geophysical\ndata (Stein, 1992) and onshore interpretation of depo-\nsitional patterns in the Torridonian (e.g. Williams,\n2001) suggest that an additional, regionally significant\nnormal faulting event occurred along the Minch\nFault\/Outer Hebrides Fault Zone synchronous with\nthe deposition of the Torridon Group sandstones in\nnorthwest Scotland c. 1000 Ma (see also Stewart,\n2002). There is no unequivocal evidence onshore for\nthis fault movement (but see Section 3.c). The presence\nof presumably undeformed and unmetamorphosed\nTorridonian rocks in the immediate hanging wall of\nthe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone beneath the Minch and\nSea of the Hebrides basins implies that the 6 km thick,\nthrust-related greenschist- to amphibolite-facies\nmylonitic shear zone (event 1, northern fault segment)\nformed prior to 1000 Ma. Although previous workers\nhave described local occurrences of mylonite on Barra\nand South Uist whose kinematics are consistent with\ntop-to-the-NW shear (MacInnes, Alsop & Oliver,\n2000; Osinski, Alsop & Oliver, 2001), the absence of a\nmajor ductile shear zone leads us to concur with\nButler, Holdsworth & Strachan (1995) who suggest\nthat there is no evidence for regional, top-to-the-NW\nductile thrusting along the southern segment of the\nOuter Hebrides Fault Zone (Fig. 1b).\nIn this contribution, we describe critical field rela-\ntionships on the island of Scalpay (Fig. 1b, c) that \nconstrain the timing of the ductile thrusting along the\nnorthern segment, and hence the age of Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone initiation, to being post-c. 1700\nMa. Our interpretation contrasts with that of previous\nworkers who proposed a much older, Inverian age\n(c. 2500 Ma) for fault initiation in the Outer Hebrides\n(Lailey, Stein & Reston, 1989). Finally, we place our\nfindings in a regional context in the light of published\ngeochronological studies of the Lewisian Complex in\nthe Outer Hebrides and elsewhere (Cliff & Rex, 1989;\nCliff, Rex & Guise, 1998; Friend & Kinny, 2001).\n2. Field relationships on Scalpay\nThe island of Scalpay provides a well-exposed NW to\nSE section from the Lewisian Complex basement\ngneisses of \u2018foreland\u2019 up into an overprinting shear\nzone with SE-dipping protomylonitic to mylonitic fab-\nrics (Fig. 1b, c; R. H. Sibson, unpub. Ph.D. thesis,\nUniv. London, 1977). The belt of mylonitic fabrics\nhere is at least 1000 m thick and its upper boundary is\nnot exposed. Scalpay is somewhat anomalous in that\nbrittle fault rocks formed during later top-to-the-W\nCaledonian thrusting are less widely developed com-\npared to other parts of the northern fault zone segment\n(e.g. R. H. Sibson, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. London,\n1977; J. Walker, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. London,\n1990; Fettes et al. 1992; C. A. Butler, unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. Durham, 1995; J. Imber, unpub. Ph.D.\nthesis, Univ. Durham, 1998). However, the cross-cut-\nting relationships displayed by ductile, top-to-the-NW\nthrust-related fabrics and minor intrusions within\nLewisian gneisses are critical to determining the rela-\ntive age of the earliest mylonitic fabrics in the northern\nsegment of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone.\n2.a. Lithologies, macrostructure and deformation\nenvironment\nFour main lithological\/structural associations are pre-\nserved on Scalpay: (1) the Lewisian protolith assem-\nblage of orthogneisses which crop out in the northwest\nof the island; (2) a zone of these gneisses in southeast-\nern Scalpay that are overprinted by a SE-dipping \nprotomylonitic and mylonitic fabric; (3) infrequent,\nCaledonian-age top-to-the-W thrust-related catacla-\nsite and pseudotachylyte veins that cross-cut both the\nmylonitic fabric and Laxfordian-age pegmatite sheets\nin the \u2018foreland\u2019; and (4) discrete, NE\u2013SW-trending\nCaledonian sinistral strike-slip (top-to-the-NE) phyl-\nlonite belts that lie concordant to and locally rework\nthe mylonitic fabrics at Cnoc na Croich, Kennavay and\nelsewhere in southeastern Scalpay (Fig. 1c). The\nnature and tectonic significance of these Caledonian-\nage phyllonitic shear zones have been discussed in\ndetail elsewhere (Butler, Holdsworth & Strachan,\n1995; Imber et al. 1997; Imber et al. 2001) and they are\nnot considered further here.\nThe protolith assemblage in Scalpay consists of\nhornblendic acid orthogneisses, with infrequent basic\u2013\nultrabasic bodies up to several hundred metres in\ndiameter (the \u2018Older Basics\u2019 of Fettes et al. 1992), and\nlater locally discordant amphibolite sheets (the\n\u2018Younger Basics\u2019 of Fettes & Mendum, 1987), all of\nwhich are cross-cut by granitic pegmatite sheets and\nveins. The Younger Basics have been correlated with\nthe Scourie dykes that intrude the Lewisian Complex\non the Scottish mainland and have been dated there at\n2400\u20132000 Ma (U\u2013Pb baddelyite: Heaman & Tarney,\n1989). The Scourie dykes are themselves part of a\nmajor Proterozoic dyke swarm that extends from\n610 J. I M B E R A N D OT H E R S\nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone 611\nFigure 1.

The\ngranitic pegmatite veins in the Outer Hebrides are\nwidespread and have been attributed to mainly\nLaxfordian tectonothermal activity at 1700 Ma\n(Fettes & Mendum, 1987). SHRIMP\u2122 analyses of\nzircon grains from two granite sheets in western Lewis\nyielded mean ages of 1674 \u00b1 3 and 1683 \u00b1 9 Ma\n(Friend & Kinny, 2001; Fig. 1b). The significance of\nthese isotopic ages in constraining the relative age of\nfault initiation is discussed in Sections 2.b and 3.\nThe lower margin of the mylonitic zone is grada-\ntional and characterized by a progressive change in the\norientation of the compositional banding in the\ngneisses from a mainly NW\u2013SE trend in the foreland\nto a NE\u2013SW trend within the mylonitic zone (Fig. 1c).\nThe mylonitic zone itself is heterogeneous and com-\nprises interbanded packages of quartzofeldspathic\nand phyllosilicate-bearing protomylonitic to mylonitic\ngneiss, together with highly deformed, concordant\nsheets of mylonitic amphibolite and pegmatite (Imber\net al. 2001). Qualitatively, the proportion of mylonitic\nto protomylonitic gneiss appears to increase towards\nthe south and east. R. H. Sibson (unpub. Ph.D. thesis,\nUniv. London, 1977) has suggested that this fabric dis-\ntribution reflects a general increase in strain towards\nthe southeast and away from the lower margin of the\nmylonite belt. Within packages of the quartzo-\nfeldspathic protomylonitic\u2013mylonitic gneiss, the SE-\ndipping foliation is associated with a consistently\nSE-plunging mineral stretching lineation (Fig. 1c)\ndefined principally by partially recrystallized \u2018ribbon\u2019\nquartz grains. Kinematic indicators, including asym-\nmetric shear bands and s -type quartz and feldspar\nporphyroclasts, are everywhere consistent with top-to-\nthe-NW shear (that is, thrusting) across the mylonitic\nbelt. Within most of the packages of phyllosilicate-\nbearing mylonitic gneiss, the SE-dipping foliation also\ncarries a generally SE-plunging lineation defined by\nsyn-tectonic quartz\u2013actinolite or quartz\u2013chlorite fibres.\nAsymmetric chlorite-rich shear bands and quartz and\nfeldspar porphyroclasts define a top-to-the-NW sense\nof thrusting.\nCollectively, the thrust-related protomylonitic to\nmylonitic gneisses consist mainly of flattened, par-\ntially altered feldspar (oligoclase and K-feldspar)\ngrains, hornblende porphyroclasts, quartz ribbons,\ninfrequent biotite laths and syn-tectonic aggregates of\nsericite, albite, fibrous actinolite and epidote. The\nquartz ribbons display strong undulose extinction and\nlocally well-developed core-and-mantle microstruc-\ntures. Actinolite fibres, which are typically oriented\nsub-parallel to the macroscopic mineral stretching lin-\neation, fill the intra- and trans-granular extension frac-\ntures that are commonly observed to cross-cut\nindividual hornblende grains and deformed amphibo-\nlite sheets (e.g. Fig. 2). The co-existence of hornblende\nand biotite (present in the parent gneisses) with syn-\ntectonic actinolite, and the development of quartz\ncore-and-mantle structures and ribbons, suggest that\nductile, top-to-the-NW thrusting occurred under\nupper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies condi-\ntions, that is, temperatures in excess of 500 \u00b0C\n(Miyashiro, 1994; Passchier & Trouw, 1996). This is\nconsistent, within error, with estimates of 535 \u00b1 50 \u00b0C\n(Fettes & Mendum, 1987) and 520 \u00b1 60 \u00b0C (White,\n1996) obtained from the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone\nmylonitic zone further north at Seaforth Head (Fig.\n1b). We conclude, therefore, that the mylonitic gneisses\nexposed on Scalpay formed within the mid-crust dur-\ning top-to-the-NW overthrusting.\n2.b. Cross-cutting relationships\nOn Scalpay, the orientation of intrusive phases relative\nto the mylonitic fabric is a useful qualitative strain\nmarker (R. H. Sibson, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ.\nLondon, 1977). Three elongate (> 200 m long) macro-\nscopic low strain zones, in which sheets of Younger\nBasic amphibolite and Laxfordian granitic pegmatite\nare generally discordant to the mylonitic fabric, occur\nalong the south and east coasts of the island (Lag na\nLaire, NG 232942; Eilean Glas, NG 245946; and\nGreinem, NG 245955; Fig. 1c). The dominant fabric\nin the orthogneisses is protomylonitic, but the planar\nand linear components are similarly oriented to those\nelsewhere in the mylonitic shear zone. A series of\napparently discordant, folded Younger Basic sheets\n(mostly < 0.5 m thick) occur within the Lag na Laire\nlow strain zone. As first recognized by R. H. Sibson\n(unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. London, 1977), the mar-\ngins of these amphibolite sheets are invariably oblique\nto the mylonitic foliation (Figs 2, 3a). This led Lailey,\nStein & Reston (1989) to suggest that the igneous pre-\ncursors of the amphibolite sheets were intruded after\nthe earliest stages of mylonitization. The same authors\nalso believed that the Laxfordian granitic pegmatites\ncross-cut and therefore post-dated the earliest\nmylonitic fabrics preserved in the low strain augen. On\nthis basis, Lailey, Stein & Reston (1989) argued that\nthe initiation of ductile, top-to-the-NW thrusting pre-\ndated the intrusion of basic dykes at c. 2400 Ma, and\nprobably occurred during the Inverian event that is\ndated on the Scottish mainland at c. 2500 Ma (Park \net al. 1994).\nWe have re-examined the critical outcrops at Lag na\nLaire and propose an alternative interpretation to that\nof Lailey, Stein & Reston (1989). There are three criti-\ncal lines of evidence demonstrating that all myloniti-\nzation post-dates basic dyke and granitic pegmatite\nemplacement. These are as follows:\n(1) The protomylonitic fabric clearly passes without\ndeflection from the orthogneisses into the thinner\namphibolite sheets (Figs 2, 3b) within which it is\ndefined by laterally discontinuous strands of sericite\nthat wrap relatively undeformed, unaltered horn-\n612 J. I M B E R A N D OT H E R S\nblende and highly altered feldspar porphyroclasts\n(Fig. 3c). Although the cores of the thicker amphibo-\nlite sheets are massive and apparently undeformed, the\nprotomylonitic fabric clearly passes into their margins.\n(2) The amphibolites are cut by arrays of intra- and\ntrans-granular extension fractures. These are infilled\nby aggregates of fibrous quartz and actinolite that are\naligned parallel to the macroscopic mineral lineation.\nMacroscopic arrays of NE\u2013SW-trending, fibrous\nquartz\u2013epidote veins also cross-cut the thickest\namphibolite sheets (Fig. 2). The orientation of the\nfibrous infills is generally consistent with tensile vein\nopening in a direction parallel to the thrust-related,\nSE-plunging mineral lineation. These veins are pro-\ngressively sheared into concordance with the mylonitic\nfoliation as they are traced from the more competent\namphibolites into adjacent, less competent mylonitic\nquartzofeldspathic rocks (e.g. Imber et al. 2001,\nfig. 11d).\n(3) The protomylonitic fabric is present in all peg-\nmatites where it is developed to variable degrees. As is\nthe case with the amphibolites, the thinnest pegmatites\ncarry a through-going fabric, whereas the thickest\nexamples are mainly massive and only foliated along\ntheir margins (Fig. 2). The microstructures of quartz\nand feldspar are identical to those observed in the host\nprotomylonitic gneisses (see C. A. Butler, unpub.\nPh.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1995). Top-to-the-NW\nshear band fabrics are widely preserved (Fig. 3d).\nTo summarize, our study shows that the thrust-\nrelated protomylonitic fabric in southeast Scalpay is\neverywhere superimposed on, and therefore post-dates,\nall components of the gneiss complex, including the\nYounger Basic amphibolites and the Laxfordian peg-\nmatites. Similar relationships are preserved in the\nSeaforth Head area (Fig. 1b; C. A. Butler, unpub.\nPh.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1995; J. Imber, unpub.\nPh.D. thesis, Univ. Durham, 1998). In the following\nsection, we discuss the timing and early tectonic signif-\nicance of the mid-crustal ductile thrusting event in the\nlight of published geological and geochronological\nstudies in the Outer Hebrides and elsewhere.\n3. Discussion\nRecent geochronological studies by Friend & Kinny\n(2001) suggest that the steeply dipping, NW\u2013\nSE-trending South Harris Shear Zones (Fig. 1b) are a\nmajor terrane boundary within the Lewisian Complex\nof the Outer Hebrides, juxtaposing Archaean gneisses\nin Lewis and north Harris (their Tarbert terrane)\nagainst a juvenile, Proterozoic arc complex in south\nHarris (their Roineabhal terrane) (Fig. 4). Friend &\nKinny (2001) argued that terrane accretion occurred\nafter c. 1675 Ma on the basis that Laxfordian-age\ngranite sheets do not crop out in south Harris. In addi-\ntion, they suggest that a further tectonic boundary\n(Ensay Shear Zone), separating the Roineabhal \nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone 613\nFigure 2.

Transpressive con-\nvergence across the South Harris Shear Zones during\naccretion was probably responsible for the develop-\nment of some or all of the earlier amphibolite- to\nlocally granulite-facies shear zone fabrics documented\nwidely in this region (see Fig. 4; e.g. Coward, 1984). A\nkey question is, therefore, when did ductile thrusting\noccur along the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone relative to\ndisplacements in the vicinity of the South Harris\nShear Zones? Two \u2018end-member\u2019 models are discussed\nbelow: (1) thrusting prior to terrane accretion, and (2)\nthrusting after terrane accretion. In this discussion, it\nis assumed that the Uist block was accreted at essen-\ntially the same time as the Roineabhal terrane.\n3.a. Thrusting prior to terrane accretion\nFriend & Kinny\u2019s (2001) data indicate there was a\nperiod of \u2021 c. 10 Myr between the onset of Laxfordian\ngranite sheet emplacement in Lewis (c. 1685 Ma) and\nterrane accretion (post c. 1675 Ma) in south Harris.\nFettes et al. (1992) observed that many Laxfordian\ngranite sheets which crop out to the west of the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone in south Lewis and north Harris\nexhibit a top-to-the-NW thrust-related solid-state\ndeformational fabric of variable intensity. Fettes et al.\n(1992) suggested that deformation occurred during the\nlater stages of intrusion emplacement and equated the\nthrusting to the earliest movements recognized along\nthe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone. If correct, the intia-\ntion of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone could therefore\nbe Laxfordian and be restricted to the Tarbert terrane\n(Fig. 4a i) as it pre-dates accretion across the South\nHarris Shear Zones (Fig. 4a ii). We are, however, cau-\ntious about accepting this interpretation for two rea-\nsons. Firstly, no systematic structural study of the\nemplacement history of the Laxfordian granite and\npegmatite sheets in the Outer Hebrides has yet been\nundertaken. The structures described could certainly\nbe associated with emplacement of the igneous bodies\nduring the late Laxfordian, but there is no compelling\nevidence linking these features to movements along\nthe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone. Secondly, as Fettes et\nal. (1992) acknowledge, similar features have been\nnoted in the Laxford Bridge\/Scourie area on the\nScottish mainland, where Peach et al. (1907) recorded\noccurrences of partially mylonitic granite or pegmatite\nin Lewisian gneisses apparently unaffected by shear-\ning. Granite sheets in this part of the mainland base-\nment have yielded U\u2013Pb (SHRIMP\u2122) zircon ages of\nc. 1855 Ma, and are therefore much older than, and\nunrelated to, those on the Outer Hebrides (Friend &\nKinny, 2001). Late granite sheets of quite different\nages within the Lewisian basement therefore carry\nsimilar syn-emplacement deformation features that\ncannot be tied or correlated into any single structural\nevent. Thus, although we cannot rule out fault initia-\ntion synchronous with granite sheet emplacement c.\n1685 Ma (Fig. 4a i\u2013iv), our preferred solution (Fig. 4b;\nSection 3.b) suggests that the main phase of ductile\nthrusting for which evidence is preserved along the\nOuter Hebrides Fault Zone is likely to be significantly\nyounger.\n3.b. Thrusting after terrane accretion\nIf the main phase of thrusting occurred after terrane\naccretion in the vicinity of the South Harris Shear\nZones (Fig. 4b i), it follows that the ductile thrust-\nrelated mylonites of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone\nare generally younger than c. 1675 Ma. Their lower\nage limit is constrained by the presence of unmeta-\nmorphosed Torridonian strata (deposited c. 1000 Ma)\nin the fault zone hanging wall at depth offshore (e.g.\nStein, 1992) and by cross-cutting pseudotachylyte\nveins that have been correlated with similar features in\nthe southern Outer Hebrides and dated there at \nc. 430 Ma (Kelley, Reddy & Maddock, 1994).\nCliff & Rex (1989) showed that there is an abrupt\ntransition in Rb\u2013Sr biotite ages across the Langavat\nshear zone (the northern strand of the South Harris\nShear Zones). Ages greater than 1300 Ma were\nobtained from gneisses to the south of the Langavat\nshear zone, whilst \u2018Grenvillian\u2019 ages (c. 1100 Ma) were\nobtained from texturally equilibrated, amphibolite-\nfacies gneisses in Lewis and north Harris. Cliff & Rex\n(1989) attributed this age distribution to a \u2018general\nreheating\u2019 of the gneisses in the northern Outer\nHebrides, followed by cooling due to postulated kilo-\nmetre-scale, north-side-up displacements across the\nLangavat shear zone at c. 1100 Ma. The origins of this\nreheating event are not discussed by these authors. We\nsuggest that, in the absence of any contemporaneous\nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone 615\nFigure 3.

Significantly, the temperatures attained\nduring thrusting (c. 500 \u00b0C; Section 2.a) would have\nbeen sufficient to reset Rb\u2013Sr biotite ages in the foot-\nwall gneisses (the biotite closure temperature for the\nRb\u2013Sr system is c. 320 \u00b0C: Ghent, Stout & Parrish,\n1988), but are unlikely to have been high enough to\nfully reset the equivalent hornblende geochronometers\n(the hornblende closure temperature to argon is \nc. 530 \u00b1 40 \u00b0C: Ghent, Stout & Parrish, 1988). This\ninterpretation is, therefore, consistent with the pre-\ndominantly Laxfordian 39Ar\u201340Ar hornblende ages\n(1600\u20131700 Ma) obtained from gneisses throughout\nLewis and north Harris (Cliff, Rex & Guise, 1998).\nStructural and kinematic studies of the South\nHarris Shear Zones (Graham, 1980; Coward & Park,\n1987; C. A. Butler, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ.\nDurham, 1995; T. Lapworth, unpub. Ph.D. thesis,\nUniv. Liverpool, 2001) have identified a \u2018late\u2019, green-\nschist-facies dextral\u2013oblique slip event that uplifted\nLewis and north Harris relative to south Harris.\nAssuming kilometre-scale displacements, the dextral\u2013\noblique slip event across the South Harris Shear Zones\nis consistent with the north-side-up event postulated\nby Cliff & Rex (1989) and it further suggests that any\ncontinuation of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone ductile\nthrust mylonitic belt to the south of the South Harris\nShear Zones would have been displaced towards the\nwest so that it presently lies offshore (Fig. 4b iii).\n3.c. Other regional implications\nOur findings raise questions about fault movement\nevents in different parts of the Outer Hebrides Fault\nZone in both onshore and offshore regions, and may\nalso shed new light on the relationship between the\nrocks of the Lewisian Complex on the Scottish main-\nland and those of the Outer Hebrides. The tectonic\nmodels discussed here imply that the southern seg-\nment of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone is significantly\nyounger than the thrust-related mylonite belt to the\nnorth (Fig. 4a iv, b iv). Cross-cutting relationships on\nthe Uists and Barra show that brittle faults and\npseudotachylyte\/cataclasite veins are the oldest struc-\ntures to crop out along the length of the southern seg-\nment. Although Kelley, Reddy & Maddock (1994)\nhave dated a single pseudotachylyte thrust vein \nfrom the island of Grimsay (Fig. 1b) to c. 430 Ma,\nwe cannot discount the possibility that some of the\npseudotachylyte is older and perhaps related to the\nProterozoic-age (c. 1000 Ma) extension event observed\noffshore (Stein, 1992; Imber et al. 2001). Osinski,\nAlsop & Oliver (2001) have pointed out that extension-\nrelated pseudotachylyte veins are widely developed\nwithin the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone on South Uist;\nthis may also be true in other parts of the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone. We believe there is scope for a\nsystematic 39Ar\u201340Ar study of pseudotachylyte fault\nveins (following techniques described by Kelley, Reddy\n& Maddock, 1994) to constrain further the timing of\nbrittle deformation.\nFriend & Kinny (2001) showed that there are major\nsimilarities between the basement of east Greenland\nand the Outer Hebrides, but that there is no clear cor-\nrelation between the latter and the Lewisian basement\nof the Scottish mainland. These authors proposed that\ninitial amalgamation of the Outer Hebrides and the\nScottish mainland blocks is most likely to have\noccurred either along the Minch Fault (Fig. 1b), a\nsteeply dipping normal fault that, on seismic sections,\nis seen to branch upwards from the Outer Hebrides\nFault Zone (Stein, 1988, 1992), or along the Outer\nHebrides Fault Zone itself. Although we cannot quan-\ntify the ductile thrust offsets c. 1100 Ma, the intensity\nof mid-crustal deformation and c. 6 km thickness of\nthe mylonitic belt implies regionally significant dis-\nplacements. This suggests that final amalgamation of\nthe mainland and Outer Hebridean portions of the\nLewisian complex was facilitated by the initiation of\nthe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone. Our model implies\nthat the gneisses in the Uists were carried in the hang-\ning wall of the ductile thrust-related mylonitic belt\n(Fig. 4b ii). Thus they are likely to have experienced a\ndifferent thermal history to the basement rocks in\nLewis and north Harris. However, any attempt at cor-\nrelating events in the basement gneisses of the Uists\nwith those of the mainland will be complicated by the\neffects of later reactivations along the Outer Hebrides\nFault Zone (e.g. see Imber et al. 2001) including up to\n90 km of late Caledonian-age sinistral strike-slip \ndisplacement (Piper, 1992; Butler, Holdsworth &\nStrachan, 1995). We suggest that SHRIMP\u2122 analyses\nof zircons from the Uists, coupled with Rb\u2013Sr dating\nof syn-tectonic white mica (sericite) grains in the duc-\ntile mylonitic belt of the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone\nand later greenschist-facies fault rocks of the South\nHarris Shear Zones (cf. Freeman et al. 1997), would\nhelp clarify the timing and sequence of events involved\nin the final tectonic assembly of the Lewisian complex\nin northwest Scotland.\nOur model proposing final amalgamation of the\nLewisian Complex at c. 1100 Ma coincides in timing\nwith Grenvillian collisional orogenesis in northeastern\nCanada (e.g. Rivers, 1997), Scandinavia (e.g. Brewer \nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone 617\nFigure 4.

This implies that Grenvillian events played a sig-\nnificant role in the late Proterozoic evolution of some\nparts of the Scottish Highlands. These events may also\nbe linked in some way to the formation of eclogite and\nits exhumation at c. 1050 Ma in Lewisianoid rocks pre-\nserved in the Moine Nappe at Glenelg on the Scottish\nmainland (Sanders, van Calsteren & Hawkesworth,\n1984; Fig. 1a).\nAcknowledgements.
