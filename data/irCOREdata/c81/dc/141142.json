Introduction\nBiodrying (biological drying) is an option for the bioconversion reactor in\nmechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plants, a significant alternative for treating\nresidual municipal solid waste (MSW). Waste treatment plants defined as MBT\nintegrate mechanical processing, such as size reduction and air classification, with\nbioconversion reactors, such as composting or anaerobic digestion. Over the last 15\n3years MBT technologies have established their presence in Europe (Binner, 2003;\nHaritopoulou and Lasaridi, 2007; Ibbetson, 2006; Juniper, 2005; Neubauer, 2007;\nPires et al., 2007; Stegmann, 2005; Steiner, 2005, 2006), with 6,350,000 Mg a-1 of\nresidual waste currently treated in Germany alone (Kuehle-Weidemeier, 2007). MBT\nis emerging as an attractive option for developing countries as well (GTZ, 2003;\nLornage et al., 2007; Pereira, 2005; Raninger et al., 2005; Tr\u00e4nkler et al., 2005).\nTo our knowledge, the term \u201cbiodrying\u201d was coined by Jewell et al. (1984) whilst\nreporting on the operational parameters relevant for drying dairy manure. Here, the\nterm \u201cbiodrying\u201d denotes: (1) the bioconversion reactor within which waste is\nprocessed; (2) the physiobiochemical process, which takes place within the reactor;\nand (3) the MBT plants that include a biodrying reactor: \u201cbiodrying MBT,\u201d hereafter.\nTypically, the biodrying reactor within MBT plants receives shredded unsorted\nresidual MSW and produces a biodried output which undergoes extensive mechanical\npost-treatment. Within the biodrying bioreactor the thermal energy released during\naerobic decomposition of readily degradable organic matter is combined with excess\naeration to dry the waste (Fig. 1).\nThis is attractive for MBT plants established to produce solid recovered fuel\n(SRF) as their main output, because removing the excessive moisture of the input\nwaste facilitates mechanical processing and improves its potential for thermal\nrecovery (Rada et al., 2007b). A major benefit of SRF production in MBT with\nbiodrying is the opportunity to incorporate the biogenic content of the input waste, a\ncarbon dioxide (CO2)-neutral, alternative energy source (Flamme, 2006; Mohn et al.,\n2008; Staber et al., 2008), into a fuel product. This produces an SRF low in CO2\nspecific emission loading (Heering et al., 1999), mitigating the waste management\ncontribution to climate change. As result, there is high interest in biodrying MBT\n4plants: 20 commercial references are currently operational in Europe, with overall\ncapacity of ca. 2,000,000 Mg a-1 (Herhof GmbH, 2008; Shanks, 2007).\nHowever, biodrying remains a relatively new technology and published research\nis limited. Experience from commercial full-scale application of biodrying MBT\nplants spans only over the last decade. The first plants that became operational were\nthe Eco-deco in Italy (1996) using the \u201cBioCubi\u00ae\u201d aerobic drying process; and the\nHerhof process in Asslar, Germany (1997), using the \u201cRotteboxes\u00ae.\u201d Despite having\nbeen subject to research (Calcaterra et al., 2000; Wiemer and Kern, 1994), is neither\nfully understood nor optimised (Adani et al., 2002).\nThis review presents and evaluates the process science and engineering available\nfor optimal SRF production through biodrying in MBT plants. It places biodrying in\ncontext with composting and similar bioconversion applications. Experience from\nfull-scale biodrying in commercial MBT plants is also included. A separate\npublication that compliments this is in press, covering the assessment of SRF quality,\nand mechanical processing necessary to be coupled with biodrying for SRF\nproduction in MBT plants (Velis et al., in press). In order to understand the science\nand engineering of biodrying processes adequately, it is necessary to make reference\nto commercially available technologies and the grey literature. Technologies are\ndescribed according to the manufacturer or trade name. The authors have no interest\nin promoting or endorsing specific technologies.\n2. Biodying for MBT in context with similar bioconversion drying applications\nBiodrying reactors use a combination of engineered physical and biochemical\nprocesses. Reactor design includes a container coupled with an aeration system;\ncontainers can be either enclosed (Fig.1), or open tunnel-halls, or rotating drums (Fig.\n2). On the biochemical side, aerobic biodegradation of readily decomposable organic\n5matter occurs. On the physical side, convective moisture removal is achieved through\ncontrolled, excessive aeration. Whilst the general reactor configuration and\nphysiobiochemical phenomenon is similar to composting, the exact way in which it is\noperated is significantly different.\nComposting is a widely studied and largely understood natural process, controlled\nfor specific objectives within waste management. It refers to the aerobic\nbiodegradation and stabilisation of mixed organic matter substrates by micro-\norganisms, under conditions that allow development of thermophilic temperatures (de\nBertoldi et al., 1996; Epstein, 1997; Haug, 1993; Insam and de Bertoldi, 2007).\nDuring multiple cycles of biodegradation, a widely diverse population of micro-\norganisms catabolises substrates through complex biochemical reactions to satisfy\nmetabolic and growth needs, gradually leading to mineralisation of organic substances\n(Richard, 2004). The most important parameters that affect composting are substrate\ncomposition, carbon-nitrogen ratio (C\/N), oxygen content, substrate temperature, MC,\nhydrogen ion concentration (pH), aeration and the matrix characteristics of\nmechanical strength, particle-size distribution (PSD), bulk density, air-filled porosity,\nand permeability (K). Their influence on composting systems has been discussed\nelsewhere (Diaz and Savage, 2007; Haug, 1993; Schulze, 1961; Richard, 2004).\nBiodrying as a variation of composting has been described for applications, other\nthan MBT, including the composting of high MC materials, such as manure (Choi,\n2001; Richard and Choi, 1997; Wright, 2002), and of sludge from pulp and paper\nwastewater treatment intended for combustion in wood-waste furnaces (Frei et al.,\n2004a; Frei et al., 2004b; Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006; Roy, 2005). Ragazzi et al.\n(2007) investigated at bench scale the co-digestion of dewatered and treated sewage\nsludge with municipal waste.\n6Research relevant to biodrying has been also conducted for near-ambient grain\ndrying for food preservation (Brazier, 1996; Nellist and Brook, 1987), and for the\ncombined drying and storage of forest residues (Nellist et al., 1993). Near-ambient air\ndrying (or bulk storage drying) uses the flow of air through harvested grains or forest\nresidues in deep beds to dry and preserve them (Nellist, 1998). Matrix temperatures\nup to 5\u00baC above ambient are reached. The critical operational and state parameters\nare matrix-related (MC, equilibrium MC, safe storage time, and pressure resistance to\nairflow) and air-related (airflow rate and psychrometric properties, i.e., properties\nreferring to the thermodynamic and physical relationship between air and water\nvapour, such as relative humidity, temperature, etc). Careful management of the\nprocess and suitable climatic conditions are critical for successful near-ambient air-\ndrying.\nBiodrying differs from composting and near-ambient air drying in terms of the\nobjectives of each process. Composting produces a humus-like \u201ccompost\u201d that can be\nbeneficially and safely applied to land, subject to regulatory approval. Composting is\nalso used to stabilise the biodegradable organic material of MSW prior to landfill\ndisposal, minimising leachate and landfill gas formation. Near-ambient air drying: (1)\ndries grains or forestry residues before storage to prevent spoilage; (2) achieves low\nspecific energy consumption; and (3) reduces the risk of over-drying, as opposed to\nheated dryers, by using air temperatures close to the ambient level (Nellist, 1998;\nNellist et al., 1993).\nIn contrast, the biodrying reactor aims to pre-treat waste at the lowest possible\nresidence time in order to produce a high quality SRF. This is achieved by: (1)\nincreasing the energy content (EC) (Adani et al., 2002) by maximising removal of\nmoisture present in the waste matrix and preserving most of the gross calorific value\n7of the organic chemical compounds through minimal biodegradation; (2) facilitating\nthe incorporation of the partly preserved biogenic content into the SRF; and (3)\nrendering the output more suitable for mechanical processing by reducing its\nadhesiveness.\nSecondary benefits are also achieved. Biodrying renders the material more\nsuitable for short-term storage and transport both by partially biostabilising it and by\nreducing its MC below the necessary threshold for biodegradation to occur. Partial\nsanitisation of the output is also accomplished (Adani et al., 2002; Calcaterra et al.,\n2000; Rada et al., 2005; Sugni et al., 2005; Wiemer and Kern, 1994); for the bulk of\nthe biodried product sanitisation to high standards is not necessary, because most of it\nis not intended to be applied on land but to be thermally recovered.\nTable 1 summarises process objectives and typical parameter values for biodrying\nand similar bioconversion technologies. Notwithstanding that technology transfer\ncould be feasible, wide differences are evident. Hence, uncritical extrapolation of\nresults to different reactor designs, scales, substrates, and operating regimes may be\nmisleading.\n3. Biodrying process science fundamentals and engineering\n3.1. Operating principles of biodrying: drying\nDrying technology generally reduces the MC of a matrix by the application of heat,\ncausing water to evaporate into the air phase (vapour), and produce dried outputs of\ndesired characteristics (Dufour, 2006). Drying phenomena have been widely\nresearched (Hall, 2007). However, the micro-scale mechanisms of drying are highly\ncomplex and not fully understood (Konovalov, 2005). Drying technology has been\ndeveloped within the scope of food, agricultural, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, and\n8many other industries (Mujumdar, 2004, 2007). For environmental engineering\napplications, dryers using external sources of heat have been used for refuse-derived\nfuel (RDF) drying (e.g., rotary cascade and thermopneumatic) (Manser and Keeling,\n1996) and sludge dewatering (Chen et al., 2002).\nIn biodrying, the main drying mechanicsm is convective evaporation, using heat\nfrom the aerobic biodegradation of waste components and facilitated by the\nmechanically supported airflow. The MC of the waste matrix is reduced through two\nmain steps: (1) water molecules evaporate (i.e., change phase from liquid to gaseous)\nfrom the surface of waste fragments into the surrounding air; and (2) the evaporated\nwater is transported through the matrix by the airflow and removed with the exhaust\ngasses. Limited amount of free water may seep though the waste matrix and be\ncollected at the bottom of the biodrying reactor as leachate.\n3.2. The drying phenomenon\nIn biodrying, air convection and molecular diffusion are the main transport\nmechanisms responsible for moisture flow through the matrix (Frei et al., 2004b). Air\nconvection, induced by engineered airflow through the matrix, is almost exclusively\nresponsible for the water losses. Here, air carries the water evaporated from the\nsurface of matrix particles (free moisture) with which is in contact. Removal of water\ncontent from the waste matrix (desorption) by convective evaporation is governed by\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium between the wet waste matrix (solid state) and the air\nflowing through the matrix (gaseous phase). Mujumdar (1997) provided an extensive\nlist of the psychrometric properties (thermodynamic and transport phenomena related)\nof the air pertaining to drying. Pakowski et al. (1991) reported the engineering\nproperties of humid air.\n9Whilst no relevant research particular to biodrying is available, relative science\nhas been summarised elsewhere for the cases of drying of foods (Basu et al., 2006),\ngrains (Mujumdar and Beke, 2003) and wood (Krupinska et al., 2007). The vapour-\ncarrying capacity of air is limited at each Tair and reached at saturation point, after\nwhich condensation occurs. At a given level of relative humidity (rH) of air (rHair)\nthe mass of water vapour the air can hold increases with the temperature. rHair has\nbeen used in near-ambient drying modelling to estimate the distance from saturation\npoint of inlet air, i.e., can be simplistically perceived as a surrogate measure of its\ndrying potential.\nFor desorption to happen the rHair has to be lower than the equilibrium relative\nhumidity (ERHair), i.e., the rHair value at which the MC of air-vapour mixture (MCair)\nis in equilibrium with the MC of the matrix (MCwaste). This is also expressed as the\nequilibrium MC of the waste (EMCwaste) and depends on temperature and pressure\n(Mujumdar, 1997). The inverse phenomenon may also happen, where air of\nsufficiently high humidity moistens the matrix particle surfaces (adsorption), case\nevident in inverted aeration configurations of biodrying reactors (Fig. 2.A) (Frei et al.,\n2004b; Sugni et al., 2005).\nThe rHair and EMCwaste relationship can be expressed through equilibrium\nmoisture curves called sorption (adsorption\/desorption) isotherms. They are\ntemperature dependent, reflecting the temperature dependence of rHair. In principle,\nexperimentally identified and\/or mathematically simulated desorption\/adsorption\nisotherms for biodrying of residual waste matrices could potentially be used to model\nand optimise the drying process, practice established in the wider drying research and\nengineering. For instance, for grain drying, some of sorption isotherms exhibit an S-\n10\ncurve shape and a hysteresis effect appears between adsorption and desorption (Basu\net al., 2006).\nThe form in which the water is present within the solid fragments of the matrix\nhas a decisive influence on the drying phenomenon. Different regions of the sorption\nisothermal curves correspond to drying involving moisture present in different states\n(e.g., free or capillary, bound, etc), governed by different physical mechanisms, as\ndescribed elsewhere (Basu et al., 2006; Brazier, 1996; Mujumdar and Beke, 2003;\nTsang and Vesilind, 1990). Air convection may eventually dry the surface of the\nparticle, reaching the hygroscopic limit, i.e., leaving no surface areas saturated with\nwater, resulting in less water to evaporate. For further drying, additional moisture has\nto migrate from the particle interior (bound moisture) to its surface, process governed\nby diffusion mechanisms (Roy et al., 2006); e.g., during the drying of hygroscopic\nporous media, such as wood (Stanish et al., 1986).\n3.3. Energy balance of biodrying reactors\nThe energy necessary for evaporation to occur (vaporisation latent heat, or enthalpy of\nvaporisation) and any additional if the hygroscopic limit is reached, is provided\nmainly by aerobic biodegradation. In contrast conventional drying employs external\nsources of heat. The aerobic decomposition of organic mater by micro-organisms is\nan exothermic biochemical transformation that can rapidly raise matrix temperatures\nto the thermophilic range. In composting, maximum temperatures of 50-62\u00b0C for\nsmall-scale systems or up to 70\u00baC for larger reactors have been reported (Richard,\n2004). Roy et al. (2006) reported average rates of energy production due to\nbioconversion at 23-29 W kgDM-1 during biodrying of pulp and paper mill sludge.\nThis energy usually constitutes a sufficient source for drying, despite heat losses from\n11\nconvection, radiation and sensible heating of both the outlet air and any discharged\nleachate. A small part of the significant external energy needed for aeration is\nconverted to heat flow through the frictional losses caused by the mechanically\nsupported flow of air through the waste. In near-ambient grain drying, this results in\nan anticipated typical rise in the grain temperature between 0.5\u00baC and 2\u00baC (Nellist,\n1998); however, the rise may vary according to the exact ambient atmospheric and\nmatrix conditions.\nResults of heat transfer studies have established the ability in commercial, large-\nscale applications to control heat losses and subsequently matrix temperature through\nincreased aeration. For the industrial-scale and fully enclosed Herhof-Rottebox\u00ae cells\n(Fig.1) conduction by aeration (and hence water evaporation) was found to contribute\nmore than 75% to the heat transfer (Weppen, 2001). This indicated limited heat\nlosses by conductance through vessel walls and open surfaces. Instead, the most\nsignificant heat fluxes were attributed to sensible heat removed by ventilation, energy\nstorage by change in sensible heat of matrix and vessel, and micro-organism needs.\nThis result is in agreement with similar investigations in composting operations (Bach\net al., 1987; Themelis, 2005).\n3.4. Process design, monitoring and control\nOptimal biodrying can be achieved through effective reactor design and conditioning\nof the input material, combined with suitable process monitoring and control. Control\ncan be exercised by adjusting the level of operational variables (suitable to directly\nmanipulate), informed by process state variables (suitable to monitor and evaluate).\nTypical design and operational choices involve:\n12\n1. matrix conditioning through mechanical pre-processing, e.g., comminution\nand\/or mixing, affecting the physical properties of the matrix, such as the\nresistance to airflow;\n2. type of containment of waste matrix, e.g., in enclosed boxes (or \u201cbio-\ncells\u201d) (Fig. 1) or piling in tunnel windrow systems, affecting drying\nmechanisms including insulating effect and degree of compaction;\n3. use of mixing\/agitation\/rotation of the waste matrix in dynamic reactors to\nhomogenise it, i.e., achieve uniform conditions: e.g., by rotating drum\nreactors (Fig. 2.B) (Bartha and Brummack, 2007; Bartha, 2008; Skourides\net al., 2006); however, most of the existing commercial designs are static;\n4. aeration system design: inverted aeration systems have been tested (Fig.\n2.A), intending to reduce gradients experienced in prevalent unidirectional\ndesings (Frei et al., 2004b; Sugni et al., 2005);\n5. management of the aeration rate of the waste matrix, by control of the inlet\nairflow rate (Qair), to remove water vapour and off-gasses and control state\nprocess parameters, such as substrate temperature and oxygen availability;\n6. external systems for controlling the psychrometric properties of the inlet\nair (e.g., temperature, due point, relative humidity), by cooling and\ndehumidifying of the process air to enhance its capacity to hold water\nvapour, combined with partial process air recirculation; and,\n7. residence time within the reactor, affecting the degree of completion of\nbiochemical and physical processes.\nApplication of process control engineering in biodrying is challenging. The main\ndifficulty is the two-fold role of the waste matrix, being both (1) the mass to be dried,\nand (2) the substrate supporting the microbial activity, which in turn provides for the\n13\nsource of heat necessary for the drying. Another difficulty is the inherent high\nheterogeneity of the residual waste, compared with, for instance, food grains. These\nmain differences impede direct technology transfer from other control applications.\nHowever, control for biodrying could potentially benefit from the recent advances\nin general drying technology and composting applications. Control engineering for\ndrying technology is applied mainly in the food industry, but also increasingly in\npainting, pharmaceuticals and paper\/wood applications, and has advanced with the\napplication of open and closed loop optimal controllers. However, generally first\nprinciple models of drying are still lacking outside the food industry (Dufour, 2006).\nSoftware packages for drying have been developed (Devahastin, 2006; Gong and\nMujumdar, 2008; Kemp, 2007; Menshutina and Tadeusz, 2001; Wang et al., 2004).\nBoth simple and complex process control strategies are employed in commercial\nbioreactor systems treating biodegradable waste. Ward et al. (2008) reviewed control\nsystems for anaerobic digestion reactors: their general suggestions, including the\nimportance of in situ on-line monitoring and control, largely apply to all waste\ntreatment technologies. For composting aeration systems, the emphasis is upon\nproviding sufficient oxygen (O2 ) for aerobic biodegradation (de Guardia and Rogeau,\n2008), whilst simultaneously meeting the requirements of the process air clean up. A\ngeneral list of control approaches for composting aeration can be found in Haug\n(1993). Commercially available computerised systems developed for composting\ncomplex aeration control have been reviewed by Goldstein (2006).\nTheoretically, many process state variables can be used for biodrying monitoring\nto inform the control of operational variables, such as airflow rate. However, this\ndemands substantial understanding and modelling of the process science which has\nnot yet been achieved. Leonard et al. (2005) examined the effect of inlet air\n14\ntemperature, superficial velocity and humidity on the drying kinetics of convective\ndrying of wastewater sludge in a microdryier using a 33 factorial design experiment.\nThe inlet air temperature had the greatest influence. Roy et al. (2006) suggested that\nfor biodrying process control purposes the outlet air temperature should be used \u2013 not\nthe average matrix temperature, as is often the case with biostabilisation.\nCertain commercial applications use advanced control systems, including control\nloops. Bartha (2008) developed a fuzzy-logic process control system for a biodrying\nrotating drum reactor. A Herhof European patent for continuous bio-cell biodrying\nopts for control of the air supply so that the CO2 content in the exhaust air is kept\nwithin a range of 0.05-0.4% v\/v (Hansjoerg et al., 2004). Segmental air supply is\nblown through a floor plate and automatically adjusted by on-line measurements of\nheat quantity, exhaust air and matrix temperatures, air permeability of matrix, and\nCO2 exhaust concentration. Process air is cooled and dehydrated by a heat-exchanger,\nand re-circulated until a certain CO2 limit is met.\n3.5. Matrix physical-mechanical properties\nBiodrying is heavily dependent on the physical process of convective evaporation, so\nit can be assumed that physical-mechanical matrix properties are critical for process\noptimisation. Scholwin et al. (2003) stressed the importance of physical-mechanical\nproperties of waste matrices for effective process modelling and control in the case of\norganic substrate composting. The relevant parameters that could impact on effective\nbioconversion were grouped into three classes, related to material, packed bed and\nflow pattern. Understanding of relevant issues has been advanced for composting\nsubstrates (Barrington, et al., 2002; Das and Keener, 1997; Richard et al. 2004).\nProperties such as MC, air-filled porosity, permeability, mechanical strength, and\n15\ncompaction of matrix, have the potential to affect the resistance to flow of air and, in\nturn the level of airflow rate necessary for effective biodrying. Some of these\nproperties could be beneficially conditioned by pre-processing the biodrying input to\nthe bioreactor. Currently, the pre-processing strategy in most biodrying MBT plants\nis limited to coarse shredding, e.g., at 300-150 mm maximum particle size.\n3.6. Aeration system type\nMechanically supported aeration of waste is critical for biodrying. It provides a mass\nand energy flow media, enabling: (1) water content removal; (2) heat-transfer\nredistribution, removing excessive heat and, adjusting the matrix temperature; and (3)\nO2 delivery to meet the stochiometric demand for aerobic decomposition.\nExtensive research and experience on aeration is available for composting\noperations (Keener et al., 2005; Keener et al., 1997; Sesay et al., 1998), but limited for\nbiodrying. In composting, positive and negative pressure, hybrid, inverted and re-\ncirculating airflow designs have been implemented. Chiumenti (2005) has shown that\nwith static piles, as used in tunnel designs, negative pressure aeration achieves more\nhomogeneous air distribution, reducing the problem of preferential air paths that may\ncreate anaerobic pockets. In enclosed bio-cells, the usual configuration is positive\npressure, forcing air through the matrix flooring and collecting off-gasses through\nopenings located at the top.\nAir management in biodrying varies according to reactor design and process\ncomplexity. The bottom of a commercial biodrying bio-cell (Herhof Rottebox\u00ae) is\ndivided into 12 parts enabling airflow to vary in each segment, facilitating control of\nmatrix temperature (Nicosia et al., 2007). Air partial recirculation systems are often\nused in biodrying to reduce the volume of off-gasses requiring treatment; especially if\n16\nair pollution control (APC) is accomplished through high cost equipment, such as\nregenerative thermal oxidation (RTO), necessitated by stringent legislative\nrequirements in Austria and Germany (Breuer, 2007).\n3.7. Uneven drying and solutions\nOne-way airflow through the waste matrix in static bed systems (e.g., enclosed halls)\nhas been shown to cause gradients in the vertical profile of process state variables in\nboth composting and biodrying. The uneven drying is also well known in grain\ndrying, where a drying zone is established around the air supply.\nVanderGheynst et al. (1997) investigated temperature and moisture profiles of an\nin-vessel pilot-scale reactor composting synthetic food waste with initial MC 45% ar\nand 55% ar. They observed maximum temperature differences to occur together with\nsignificant MC differences; and differences in maximum temperatures in the vertical\n(\u0394Tmax) to be less than for higher aeration rates (\u0394Tmax = 32\u00baC at 0.06 l min-1 kginitial DS-\n1 and \u0394Tmax = 29\u00baC at 0.6 l min-1 kginitial DS-1).\nIn bench-scale biodrying experiments, matrix temperature differences as high as\n30\u00baC from the top to the bottom of a 800 mm high container have been observed\nduring the initial high-microbial activity phase (Adani et al., 2002; Sugni et al., 2005).\nThe Tmatrix values converged as the biodegradation ceased (Fig. 3), but the moisture\ngradient persisted. In turn, these gradients lead to heterogeneous biodried output.\nSugni et al. (2005) speculated that air flowing through the lower layers of the matrix\nhad already reached saturation point and hence could not remove additional moisture.\nThis could be in agreement with the higher temperature measured at this layer, as the\nlimited heat removal would result in a higher matrix temperature. However, it is\nworth considering the possibility of moisture accumulation in the lower layer due to\n17\ngravitational flow of free water. Whilst some authors do not consider (Adani et al.,\n2002; Sugni et al., 2005), or exclude (Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006) this possibility, in\nboth commercial biodrying systems based on halls (e.g., Eco-deco) or bio-cells (e.g.,\nHerhof), a small amount of leachate is collected (Herhof Environmental, Undated).\nIn order to overcome the uneven drying of grain matrix recirculation or continuous\nflow mixing systems are used. For biodrying, alternative aeration systems and non-\nstatic designs have been proposed to overcome gradient formation aiming at a\nhomogenised output. Two types of improved designs are (1) rotating drum reactors\n(Bartha and Brummack, 2007; Bartha, 2008; Skourides et al., 2006) and (2) inverted\nairflow designs (Fig 2). Sungi et al. (2005) experimented with reactors that simulated\ndaily inverted air flow by up-side down turning of the reactor. They observed a\nmitigation of the matrix temperature gradient (Fig. 3) and a more homogeneous\ncontent in terms of moisture and energy, compared with the unidirectional flow.\nHowever, this arrangement did not achieve early convergence with the ambient\ntemperatures as in the unidirectional experiments, indicating the necessity for a\nprolonged residence time; and the impact of solid and moisture substrate flows\nintroduced by the turning of the reactor remain uncertain.\nFrei et al. (2004b) tested a sophisticated three perforated pipe, inverted airflow\nsystem for biodrying of a sludge\/wood mixture (Fig. 2). This system employed a\ncentral conduit either pumping or pulling air, whilst the other two pipes were on invert\nairflow, and operated at a set-point airflow rate of ca. 42.5\u00b13.4 Nm3 h-1 (ca. 25\u00b12\nscfm (standard cubic feet per minute)). The configuration was criticised for removing\nwater from the wet portion and depositing it in the dry portion of the matrix; this then\nfavoured biodegradation rather than biodrying (Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006): Inverting\nthe airflow led to a drop in relative humidity of the outlet air for the next 10-20 h,\n18\nindicating that the matrix was re-wetted by the humid inlet air. This was accompanied\nby increased matrix temperatures (Fig. 3), possibly reflecting a rise in biodegradation\nactivity due to partial restoration of MC. However, as this phenomenon was more\nacute during the earlier period when the substrate was relatively wet, it is less\nimportant for residual waste treatment, because of the much lower MC of the residual\nwaste substrate (initial ca. 40 w\/w ar) compared with the pulp sludge (final ca. 40\nw\/w ar). Exhaust air became saturated once matrix temperature exceeded ca. 40\u00baC.\nThe biodried output resulting from the same experiment (Frei et al., 2004b) was\ngenerally homogenously dried. However, the lower part of the matrix was slightly\ndrier, a result converse to the effect observed by Sugni et al. (2005), who used a\ndifferent process of inverted flow. Frei et al. (2004b) attributed the differentiated\ndrying of the lower layer to preferential airflow within the matrix via the shortest\nroutes between the inlet and outlet air ports. Drying of the matrix led to a significant\nincrease in matrix permeability resulting in lower pressure across the matrix, reducing\nthe preferential flow in the lower part of the reactor (Hoffmann, 2005). A continuous\nvertical reactor configuration with segmented air flows reducing downwards (from the\nupper inlet to the lower outlet) was proposed as a potential solution for less\npreferential drying (Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006).\nIn a pilot-scale rotating drum (Fig 2.B) (Bartha, 2008), temperature differences\namong the Tout and various points within the reactor were evident, but smaller\ncompared with other static single-direction flow designs (Fig 3).\n3.8. Aeration rate and air properties\nAeration rate is the main operational variable used for process control in biodrying,\nboth in laboratory (Adani et al., 2002; Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006; Sugni et al., 2005)\n19\nand commercial applications. The inlet airflow rate can be manipulated to control\nmatrix temperature, in turn affecting the air dew point and biodegradation kinetics. A\nhigh airflow rate is necessary for the production of a sufficiently high in calorific vale\n(CV) SRF, through preserving most of the biogenic content. In a comprehensive\nstudy Adani et al. (2002) used static, adiabatic reactors fed on the fine fraction of\nshredded MSW (\u00d8 < 50 mm). Trials were conducted on set-points of middle layer\nmatrix temperature, controlled manually by adjusting the airflow rate. It was\nestablished that high airflow rate is necessary for effective and fast drying, result in\nagreement with Roy (2005). However, further studies with the same sample revealed\na low reproducibility of EC and CV, these properties being highly dependant on the\nlaboratory employed to measure them (Sugni et al., 2005).\nThe oxygen stochiometric demand for aerobic decomposition is satisfied by O2\nprovided by the high aeration rate necessary for effective drying (Epstein, 1997; Rada\net al., 2007a; Themelis, 2005). According to Epstein (1997) the aeration rate\nnecessary for moisture removal in composting is 6-10 times higher than that necessary\nfor biological activity. Rada et al. (2007a) measured the O2 concentration in the\nprocess outlet air at above 15% (generally >20%). Use of air recirculation systems\nresults in low O2 concentration in the inlet air: the rotary drum reactor tested by\nBartha and Brummack (2007) was operated with O2 concentration up to 3% v\/v.\nIn biodrying, optimisation of the drying potential of the input air can be achieved\nby adjusting its psychrometric properties. This is attained through (1) dehydration of\nthe exhaust air by cooling in a heat-exchanger and cooling tower and (2) subsequent\npartial recirculation of it after mixing with ambient air, achieving an input air mixture\nof the desirable temperature and absolute humidity (Herhof Environmental, Undated)\n(Fig.1).\n20\n3.9. Moisture content and losses\nMC of the waste matrix is the single most important variable for evaluating the\nperformance of biodrying processes. In waste management the MC is typically\nmeasured by gravimetric water content methods and expressed as a percentage of\nwater for the wet weight of the material (wet basis: ar) (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993).\nA more accurate biophysical parameter relevant to the microbial activity is the water\nmatric potential, denoting the energy with which water is held in a sample against the\nforce of gravity (Miller, 1989).\nIn biodrying, the MC can be reduced from ca. 35-55% w\/w ar (Thom\u00e9-\nKozmiensky, 2002) to 20-10% w\/w ar. During aerobic biodegradation around 0.5-0.6\ng of metabolic water is produced per g of VS decomposed (Miller, 1989, 1991).\nHowever, water losses during biodrying are much greater than the gains of metabolic\nwater, resulting in a dried matrix (Nakasaki et al., 1987b; Richard, 2004). Water\nlosses can be estimated using values of airflow rate and inlet-outlet air conditions, i.e.,\nabsolute humidity (Richard, 2004). Mass balance of MC should include both\nmetabolic water gains and evaporation-convection losses. Rada et al. (2007b) consider\noverall weight losses of 25% w\/w as typical. The authors, in test-scale biodrying\nexperiments with artificial MSW of high-moisture input (MC: 50% w\/w ar) and 50%\nw\/w organic material, reported similar time dependent curves for both the water and\nVS losses, with most losses attributable to moisture removal (ratio of weight losses\nbetween VS and condensed moisture: 1:7). The drying rate in sludge biodrying was\nreported to correlate mainly with airflow rate and outlet air temperature, which in turn\nwas found to depend on the degree of biological activity close to the air outlets\n(Navaee-Ardeh et al., 2006; Roy, 2005).\n21\nMC critically influences the dynamics of biodegradation during composting.\nOptimal moisture conditions for composting range significantly, change during the\nprocess (either increase or decrease) and vary with substrate (Richard and Choi, 1997;\nRichard et al., 2002). Regan et al. (1973) reported an optimal MC range for cellulose\ndegradation at 50-70% w\/w. Relevant overviews for waste substrates have been\nprovided by Epstein (1997), Richard (2004), and Linag et al. (2003). Liang et al.\n(2003) used factorial design experiments to investigate the influence of temperature\nand MC on microbial activity, measured as O2 uptake rate (mg g-1 h-1) during\ncomposting of biosolids, showing that MC is more influential than temperature. In\npractice, biodegradation may stop during biodrying, or its rate may be significantly\nreduced, due to complete decomposition of readily biodegradable VS (degradation\neffect), or, more possibly, due to water stress where low moisture conditions inhibit\nmicrobial activity and movement (drying effect) (Griffin, 1981; Miller, 1989).\nFor biodrying processes, the minimum MC below which the biodegradation\nprocess is inhibited has not been identified. The rate of heat production by microbial\nactivity can be anticipated to decline as the MC of the matrix approaches the water\nstress limit, affecting the drying mechanism. From composting studies it is evident\nthat below 20% w\/w very little or no microbial activity occurs (Haug, 1993).\n3.10. Air and matrix temperatures for optimal biodrying\nConflicting evidence is available for the temperature range that optimises drying.\nWhilst some modelling studies for aerobic biodegradation indicate highest moisture\nremoval at matrix temperatures at or slightly above the peak of biodegradation rate,\nexperimental evidence supports maximum drying for much lower temperatures, which\ndelay biodegradation. We speculate this contradiction can partly be attributed to\n22\nconfusion concerning the temperature referred to or measured, which could include\nthe varying or set-point, biodegradation reaction, air outlet, matrix average or in\nvarious points within the matrix. Further, results from composting models rarely\nallow for high or constant airflow rates, typical in biodrying. Comparative\ninterpretation of results is not helped by the wide variety of units used for reporting\naeration rates.\nMost evidence indicates that comparatively effective heat removal can be achieved\nby higher aeration rates resulting in lower matrix temperatures (Adani et al., 2002;\nSkourides et al., 2006; VanderGheynst et al., 1997), with an optimal Twaste as low as\nca. 45\u00baC.. In batch-scale biodrying of pulp and paler sludge Roy et al. (2006)\nreported higher drying rates (volume of removed moisture per time) for higher airflow\nrates; the curves of the Tout and Qair followed the same trends.. This is in agreement\nwith Adani et al. (2002) who achieved best drying results for the highest specific\nairflow rates they used (0.023 m3 kgTS-1 h-1) allowing for a mid-layer matrix set-point\ntemperature of 45\u00baC, whilst they even higher airflow rates for more effective drying.\nSkourides et al. (2006) investigated the agitated biodrying of the organic fraction\nof municipal solid waste in a semi-industrial rotary drum. Similarly, results showed\nmaximum drying rate achieved for the highest aeration rates used (120 m3 h-1), leading\nto lower final MC levels (20% w\/w from an initial 40% w\/w) with a shorter retention\ntime (< 7 d). This agrees with results reported by Macgregor et al. (1981) for field-\nscale, open static pile composting of sewage sludge and wood chip mixture, aerated\nby a blower and two perforated ducts system at the pile base. Lower set-point\nsubstrate temperatures (45\u00baC, as compared with 55\u00baC and 65\u00baC) achieved by longer\nblower operation, resulted in more effective drying (from 75% w\/w to ca. 20% w\/w,\nas compared to ca. 40% w\/w, respectively).\n23\nHowever, a model of semi-batch stationary composting based upon heat and mass\nbalance, and validated with laboratory and commercial scale experiments on mixtures\nof dewatered sewage sludge, seed and rice husks, reached conflicting conclusions\n(Nakasaki et al., 1987a). The optimal MC removal (from 60.3% w\/w to 44.8% w\/w)\nwas achieved at a set-point substrate temperature of 60\u00baC with an average specific\nairflow rate of 0.0143 m3 h-1 kginitial-1 after 150 h of operation, whilst a minimum set\ntemperature of 50\u00baC demanding the highest average specific airflow rate of 0.0164 m3\nh-1 kginitial-1, reduced MC only to 48.6% w\/w. The model predicted that the optimum\ntemperature for biodegradation coincided with the optimum temperature for drying, a\nresult verified for a series of biodegradation kinetics models examined by Richard and\nChoi (1997). However, this model enabled varying airflow rates, a condition which\ndoes not correspond to usual biodrying practice. Jewell et al. (1984) reported\nmaximum moisture removal rates at 46\u00baC, but maximum degradation at 60\u00baC, whilst\nstudying biodrying of dairy manure.\nMost commercial biodrying processes operate in the temperature range of 40-70\u00baC\nfor outlet air Tout, for most of the residence time (Herhof Environmental, Undated;\nJuniper, 2005). A typical temperature profile for the Nehlsen process is available\n(Juniper, 2005). Herhof Rottebox\u00ae applies a staged Tout control, consisting of four\nphases over one week: (1) start up and biomass acclimatization: 40\u00baC; (2)\ndegradation: 40-50\u00baC; (3) sanitisation and drying: 50-600C; (4) cooling to room\ntemperature 60\u00baC to ambient T (Nicosia et al., 2007).\n3.11. Microbial activity\nMicrobial processes during biodrying should be suitably harnessed for the generation\nof the heat necessary for effective drying, along with limited biodegradation of waste\n24\nsubstrates. Substrate temperature Twaste is the most critical factor affecting the\nmicrobial growth (Miller, 1996), because, inter alia, provides ideal conditions for\nproliferation of certain types of micro-organisms, e.g., mesophilic or thermophilic. In\nturn, this affects the type of organic matter that can be degraded. In composting, at\nTwaste > 60\u00baC cellulose and lignin are largely preserved, as the thermophilic fungi die-\noff, but waxes, proteins and hemicelluloses are readily metabolised by spore-forming\nbacteria and actinomycetes (Lester and Birckett, 1999).\nThe wider influence of substrate temperature on composting microbial population\ndynamics has been discussed elsewhere, including Miller (1996), Epstein (1997), and\nLiang et al. (2003). Overviews of microbial community dynamics, including group\nsuccession and utilisable substrate for different process stages and temperature ranges,\ncan be found in Marshall et al. (2004) and Insam and de Bertoldi (2007). However,\nbiodrying of MSW is operated within a MC range typically lower than the optimal\ncomposting and the Twaste profile is managed differently: therefore, biodegradation\nbehaviour may be atypical compared with composting research results (Adani et al.,\n2002).\nDuring biodrying of a high MC matrix of pulp and paper sludge, Roy et al.\n(2006) identified three separate drying stages, which correlated with microbial\npopulation growth periods: (1) acclimatisation of microbes resulting in an\nexponentially increasing drying rate; (2) exponential decrease of the drying rate due to\ninsufficient availability for nutrients for microbe consumption, and (3) constant drying\nrate, corresponding to the fluctuations of the Qair. If a similar dynamic applies to the\nmuch drier substrates of residual MSW it would indicate that after some point\nbiodrying is less dependent on the microbial activity, increasingly impeded by water\n25\nstress; becoming, instead, just a physical process (air convection). It is not clear how\nthis would affect the energy balance of the process.\n3.12. Degree of biostabilisation at process completion\nFast and effective biodrying, optimised for SRF production, can be achieved at the\nexpense of a low degree of biostabilisation for the organic substrate. Because the\nthermal energy for drying results from the decomposition of organic matter, a degree\nof biostabilisation is anticipated to have occurred at the end of the process. Regarding\nSRF product quality, the desirable degree of biostabilisation will generally be low, as\nthis would preserve carbonaceous matter, reserving CV and biogenic content.\nConversely, where the SRF is not used immediately, biostabilisation to a limited\ndegree is desirable, because this would reduce any potential storage and\nenvironmental problems caused by further biodegradation.\nThere is evidence that the degree of substrate biostabilisation is inversely\ncorrelated to a fast-rate, producing high EC output biodrying (Adani et al., 2002).\nAdani et al. (2002) showed in comparative laboratory tests that the highest airflow-\nrate enabled the fastest SRF production (ca. 150 h), along with the highest EC. Using\nlower airflow rates, the process took more than 250 h to complete and the end\noccurred because of sufficient biodegradation of readily decomposable organic\nmatter., This resulted in much higher losses of VS, leading to much lower final EC,\nrendering it unsuitable for SRF production.\nA further experiment under different process parameters showed that microbial\nactivity ceased after about 200 h, as verified by the final temperatures, which\nconverged with ambient values (Sugni et al., 2005). Thus, under controlled laboratory\nconditions, fully enclosed biodrying can be effectively completed within 8-9 d.\n26\nHowever, Rada et al. (2007a) in test-scale biodrying of high MC input (MCwaste ca.\n50% ar) observed longer times for the process completion of up to 4 w, using\nincreased aeration over the time (ca.11.5 Nm3 kgMSW-1 after two weeks of treatment\nand ca.14.5 Nm3 kgMSW-1 after four weeks).\n3.13. Biodrying configured for biostabilisation\nSome advocates of biodrying consider it feasible to use biodrying reactors for\neffective intensive composting, based on the similarities between biodrying and in-\nvessel composting. This capability would theoretically enable the process to be\nadapted for stabilising organic material intended for landfill, thereby achieving\nregulatory compliance. Such an operating mode could be adopted until a robust\nmarket for SRF was secured, as market availability is challenging under current\nconditions (Juniper, 2005; Maunder, 2005). However, further evidence is required\nbefore such process resilience can be guaranteed.\nRegarding full-scale reactors, the Eco-deco biodrying plants in Corteolona and\nBergamo, Italy have previously operated with the objective to minimise\nbiodegradability, producing a fully biostabilised output (Juniper, 2005). Scotti and\nMinetti (2007) presented Eco-deco data from the Montanaso plant showing the ability\nof the process to operate in \u201chigh speed process management\u201d mode, intending to\nachieve a higher level of weight loss in fewer days (typical weight loss of 28% w\/w ar\nof input waste reached in ca. 5 d instead of ca. 14 d; final losses of ca. 38% were\nachieved in 14 d). The authors argue, but have not quantified, that such an\noperational mode leads to higher final stability for the biodried output.\nHowever, it is evident that biostabilisation demands a very different operational\nmode than biodrying. Rada et al. (2007b) based on respirometric index measurements\n27\nargued that a biodrying operation mode is capable of achieving only partial final\noutput stability, compared with biostabilisation through composting. Input waste of\n50% in organic content reached 500 mg O2 kgTS-1 h-1 after ca. 200 h residence time\n(typical limit in Italy(Scotti and Minetti, 2007): at < 1000 mg O2 kgVS-1 h-1).\n3.14. Modelling of biodrying processes\nLimited modelling attempts for MBT-related biodrying processes exist in the peer-\nreviewed literature. However, composting processes have been extensively modelled\n(Mason, 2006; Mason and Milke, 2005a; Mason and Milke, 2005b). Particularly\nrelevant are attempts to model moisture-dependent aerobic biodegradation (Higgins\nand Walker, 2001; Pommier et al., 2008); however, evaporation phenomena were\nexcluded. Brazier (1996) reviewed modelling efforts for near-ambient drying and\ndeveloped a validated simulation model from first principles. The wider modelling\nand simulation research on grain drying has been reviewed by Parde et al. (2003).\nNakasaki et al. (1987a) modelled a generic composting process to explore the\nrelationship between aeration and drying, reaching results that contradict recent\nbiodrying experiments.\nRada et al. (2007a) provided initial biodrying modelling results focusing on\nsimulation of lower heating vale (LHV) (or net calorific value, (NCV)) dynamics,\nvolatile solids (VS) consumption, waste MC dynamics, and nitrogen compounds\nrelease. The overall loss in EC of the input waste matrix was 3% w\/w and most of the\nchange in the NVC was accomplished within the two first weeks of the process. The\nenergy produced from the bio-oxidation of the readily decomposable VS was\ndominant in the energy balance, compared with the enthalpy of the input at ambient T.\n28\nNicosia et al. (2007) combined both experimental data and theoretical\ncalculations to provide simplistic mass and energy balances for a fully operational\nbiodrying bio-cell. The process losses (37% w\/w of input) were simulated with 80%\naccuracy, stressing the importance of more accurate estimates for matrix biochemical\ncomposition and actual amount of heat generated during biodegradation. Frei et al.\n(2004b) modelled the matrix pneumatic behaviour of their complex inverted airflow\nconfiguration for biodrying of paper and pulp wastewater. Navaee-Ardeh et al.\n(2006) adopted a stepwise approach to model at an introductory level a vertical\ncontinuous biodrying reactor for sludge drying, with perpendicular forced aeration\ndiversified within four compartments. Bartha (2008) extensively modelled properties\nof a bench-scale rotary drum biodrying reactor, including its biodegradation\nbehaviour, for process control purposes.\n4. Commercial biodrying-MBT applications\nCommercial, proprietary applications of biodrying within MBT plants are described.\nIndicative flow-sheets for some of these plants can be found in the related MBT\nreview (Velis et al., in press). Following sections provide comparative data on\noperating parameters from commercial biodrying processes in full-scale plants\nsummarised in Table 2 and Table 3. Almost all data have necessarily been collected\nfrom the grey literature supplied by process providers.\n4.1. Technology provider: Eco-deco\nEco-deco is an Italian company that developed biodrying in the mid 1990s and\noperates 10 plant plants in Italy, the UK, and Spain with an overall capacity of ca.\n900,000 Mg a-1 (Shanks, 2007). The core biological process is marketed as\n29\n\u201cBioCubi\u00ae\u201d in Italy, and the overall plant as the \u201cIntelligent Transfer Station (ITS)\u201d\nunder licence by Shanks in the UK (Juniper, 2005). Scotti and Minetti (2007) provide\na recent account of the commercial reference plants of Eco-deco.\nEco-deco plant configurations differ according to the available options for\noutputs. They are fully enclosed and equipped with air pollution control systems.\nVarious process flow-lines have been described in detail elsewhere (Cozens, 2004;\nEnvironment Agency, 2007; Juniper, 2005). Waste input is shredded to ca. 200-300\nmm, with the aim of homogenisation and size reduction to improve efficiency of\nsubsequent aerobic fermentation. Biodrying occurs in an enclosed hall, with\ncomminuted input automatically stockpiled by crane in adjoining windrows. These\nare divided for process control purposes into a virtual grid that provides on-line data\nto a computerised control system.\nAir suction is applied through the waste matrix, through the vents of a pre-cast\nperforated floor and is directed to the air pollution control system. The airflow rate is\nautomatically adjusted depending on the exhaust air temperature. Various optimal\ntemperature ranges have been reported in the literature, namely 55-70\u00baC (Juniper,\n2005); 50-60\u00baC (Environment Agency, 2007); and ca. 65\u00baC (Cozens, 2004).\nResidence time within the biodrying unit is 12-15 d.\n4.2. Technology provider: Entsorga\nThe technology is marketed as \u201cH.E.BIO.T.\u00ae,\u201d(\u201cHigh Efficiency Biological\nTreatment\u201d) (Entsorga, Undated). Entsorga will be commissioning a MBT plant to\ntreat 60,000 Mg a-1 at Westbury, UK (Hill, 2005). No data on the exact process\nconfiguration and anticipated performance are yet available in the public domain.\n30\n4.3. Technology provider: Future Fuels\nFuture Fuels have recently applied for an international patent of a biodrying method\n(Hood et al., 2008), building upon pilot-scale research and development by Skourides\net al. (2006). The concept uses an inclined rotating drum (\u201cRotary bio-dryer,\u201d (RBD))\nto process a mechanically separated organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW), potentially\nmixed with selected commercial waste. The RDB is operated in alternate cooling and\nheating cycles, using consecutive rotating and static intervals, and variable airflow\nrates. The process control strategy aims to keep the temperature inside the bioreactor\noptimised for aerobic biodegradation (upper mesophilic to thermophilic range: 40-\n55\u00baC). According to the process developers, the RDB can achieve fast and\nhomogeneous drying of the OFMSW, reducing its MC from 35-40% w\/w ar to 10-\n15% w\/w ar within 3 d. Table 3 includes further process details.\n4.4. Technology provider: Herhof\nHerhof developed biodrying in 1995 (Wengenroth, 2005; Wiemer and Kern, 1994)\nand the first commercial plant to operate was in Asslar, Germany, in 1997 (Juniper,\n2005). Herhof operates 8 plants in Germany, Italy and Belgium, with overall\noperational capacity ca. 1,085,000 Mg a-1. Their processes differ slightly, to adapt to\nlocal conditions or due to evolving optimisation. Plant configurations have been\ndescribed elsewhere (Diaz et al., 2002; Herhof Environmental, Undated; Juniper,\n2005). The plants are fully enclosed, automated and equipped with APC systems.\nRotary shredders are used for mechanical pre-treatment (Rennerod: < 150 mm;\nDresden: < 200 mm). Downstream a magnetic conveyor belt removes the ferrous\nmaterial. The comminuted Fe-free output is biodried within air- and liquid-tight\nboxes (\u201cHerhof-Rotteboxes\u00ae\u201d) with capacity of 600 m3, receiving around 280 Mg of\n31\nwaste each. Filling\/unloading of material and handling of the box lid is handled\nautomatically by crane. The biodrying reactor residence time ranges from 5 to 10 d,\nwith 7 d the most common (Herhof Environmental, Undated; Herhof GmbH,\nUndated; Juniper, 2005).\nThe mass losses in the biodrying stage are around 30% w\/w input. The initial\nMC of 42% is reduced to 12% after six days biodrying in the Rennerod facility. APC\nresidue (dust) from the bag-filter (ca. 4% w\/w input) is pelletised and mixed with the\nSRF. High effectiveness has been reported for the mechanical post-biodrying at the\nRennerod-Asslar plant, with typical purity of the final \u201cDry Stabilat\u00ae\u201d over 99%, i.e.,\n< 1% impurities with a yield of around 50% of plant input. Recovery of the\ncombustible mass content of the input waste is much higher.\n4.5. Technology provider: Nehlsen\nNehlsen developed a biodrying process during the mid-1990s in Germany, marketed\nas \u201cMechanical Biological Stabilisation\u201d (MBS) and the SRF as \u201cCalobren\u00ae The\nprocess configuration is similar to Herhof, using biodrying containers with under-flow\nof partially circulated process air. In the past, plant capacities were lower and the\nmechanical refinement stage less sophisticated than other biodrying providers\n(Juniper, 2005). Breuer (2007) reported on recent operation experience of the\nStralsund plant. This facility is diversifying its production lines and SRF outputs to\nsecure multiple market outlets.\n4.6. Technology provider: Wehrle Werk\nThe Wehrle Werk system is operated on mixed MSW. It uses mechanical pre-\ntreatment followed by percolation (\u201cBio-percolat\u201d) and anaerobic digestion, aiming at\n32\neasily degradable materials (Juniper, 2005). Solid residuals from the percolator are\ndewatered by a screw press to about 40% MC. This is fed into closed tunnel\nbiodrying reactors with matrix circulation known as \u201cPercotry\u00ae.\u201d Output MC is\nreduced to below 15%. Sieving of the biodried output could produce an SRF that is\naround 35% w\/w of input waste. Process losses are around 15% w\/w.\n5. Conclusions and recommendations\nBiodrying for MBT is a versatile bioconversion process that can improve the fuel\ncharacteristics of its output, or partially biostabilise it, according to end-use. Few\nproviders of commercial biodrying processes dominate the market, but research and\ndevelopment on process variations is continued. Most of this research is proprietary\nand has not yet reached the public domain. There are limited experimental results on\nthe physiobiochemical fundamentals and dynamics of biodrying reactors; and few\nmodelling results have appeared.\nThis said, this review provides a critique of the current state-of-the-art. Evidence\nsuggests that effective biodrying demands different management of process control\nvariables than composting, to fulfil different objectives. High aeration rates and\nlimited biodegradation produce optimally biodried output, for further processing to\nSRF. Typical process times are 7-15 days, leading to weight loss of 25-30% w\/w of\nthe reactor input, mainly H2O(g) and CO2 Modification of the psychrometric\nproperties of input air and minimisation of matrix gradients for critical properties,\nsuch as MC, are critical aspects of optimisation. Inverted air and rotary drum reactor\ndesigns can improve uniformity of treatment and output quality, but they have still to\nbe proven on a commercial scale. Integration into the wider MBT plants flow-line\n33\ndeserves more attention, especially pre-conditioning for optimal airflow through the\nmatrix.\nAdditional modelling efforts could explain the prevailing process dynamics and\nevaluate the relative role and contribution to drying of the bio-conversion vs. the\nphysical mechanism of aeration. Process control can be improved. Suitability of state\nand operational process variables used for process monitoring and control respectively\nshould be further investigated. Knowledge transfer from the traditional drying\napplications can be sought for both modelling and control purposes.\nResearch should seek to examine the possible trade-offs in process performance,\nenabling optimisation in line with site-specific desired output quality and wider\nprocess objectives, eventually further increasing market confidence in biodrying MBT\nplants.\nAcknowledgements\nThe funding for this project is made possible by donations from Waste Recycling\nGroup Limited through the Landfill Communities Fund of Grantscape.
