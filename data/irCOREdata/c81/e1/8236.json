We have now assessed the prevalence of enteroviral vp-1 capsid \nstaining in a large cohort of autopsy pancreases of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients and a range of \ncontrols. \nMethods \nSerial sections of paraffin-embedded pancreatic autopsy samples from 72 recent-onset type 1 diabetes \npatients and up to 161 controls were immunostained for insulin, glucagon, enteroviral vp1, double-\nstranded RNA activated protein kinase R (PKR) and MHC class I. \nResults \nVp1 immunopositive cells were detected in multiple islets of 44\/72 young recent-onset type 1 diabetic \npatients, compared with a total of only 3 islets in 3\/50 neonatal and paediatric normal controls. Vp1 \nstaining was restricted to insulin containing beta-cells. Among the control pancreases vp1 \nimmunopositivity was also observed in some islets from 10\/25 type 2 diabetic patients. A strong \ncorrelation was established between islet cell vp1 positivity and PKR production in insulin-containing \nislets of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, consistent with a persistent viral infection of the \nislets.  \nConclusion\/ Interpretations \nImmunoreactive enteroviral vp1 is commonly found in the islets of recent-onset type 1 diabetes \npatients, but only rarely in normal paediatric controls. Vp1 immunostaining was also observed in \nsome islets of type 2 diabetes patients, suggesting that the phenomenon is not restricted to type 1 \ndiabetes patients. \n \nKeywords: Type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes environmental triggers, enterovirus, insulitis, islets of \nLangerhans, beta cells, MHC, PKR \n \n Abbreviations: CVB \u2013 Coxsackie B virus; MHC \u2013 major histocompatibility antigen; PKR \u2013 double-\nstranded RNA activated protein kinase R; Vp1 \u2013 enteroviral capsid protein vp1;  \n \n \nIntroduction \nIt has been suggested that environmental factors may be involved in triggering autoimmunity, islet \ninflammation (insulitis) and beta-cell death in type 1 diabetes. Much of the evidence supporting the \npossible involvement of viruses as initiators of type 1 diabetes in man is circumstantial, as highlighted \nin a recent review [1]. However, in support of this proposal, antibodies against common Coxsackie B \nenteroviruses (CVB) are known to occur more frequently in the serum of recent-onset type 1 diabetics \nwhen compared to controls [2] and enteroviral RNA is more prevalent in the peripheral blood [3-9] \nand serum [10] of such patients.  \n \nThese observations are consistent with a possible viral aetiology for type 1 diabetes (at least in some \npatients) but direct evidence to support this hypothesis has been more difficult to obtain. Previously a \nstrain of CVB4 was isolated from the pancreas of a recent-onset type 1 diabetic patient and shown to \nbe capable of inducing diabetes in mice [11]. More recently, the presence of enteroviral RNA in the \nislets of four recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases has been revealed by in situ hybridisation [12], \nthereby confirming that the islets of patients with type 1 diabetes can harbour a persistent viral \ninfection. In confirmation of this, the enteroviral capsid protein, vp1, was detected by \nimmunohistochemistry in the beta-cells of 2 of 5 patients with type 1 diabetes, and in a sixth diabetic  \npatient who had received a recent pancreatic transplant [13]. Examination by electron microscopy \nshowed the presence of virus particles within the islet beta cells of the cases with demonstrable vp1, \nand subsequently a strain of CVB4 was isolated from the pancreas of one of these patients. This virus \nwas capable of infecting normal human islets in vitro, resulting in their functional impairment [13].  \n \nIn view of these findings, we considered it important to establish the prevalence of immunoreactive \nvp1 staining in the islets of a much larger cohort of recent onset type 1 diabetes cases. In addition, we \nhave studied the frequency of vp1 immunopositivity in the islets of a wide range of relevant controls, \nincluding a selection of type 2 diabetes patients, to determine the specificity of the finding. We have \nalso examined the islets of these cases to establish whether an antiviral response is mounted.  \n \nIt has been shown that enteroviral infection of skeletal muscle cells both in vitro and in vivo resulted \nin production of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) within cells [14]: In keeping with this observation \ndouble-stranded RNA activated protein kinase R (PKR) was markedly upregulated in islets infected \nby Coxsackie virus B5 in vitro [15]. Similarly, islets infected by Coxsackie virus B produced \ninterferon-alpha in vitro [16] and this has been associated with hyperexpression of class I MHC by \nislets [17]. We have therefore attempted to correlate the staining of enteroviral vp1 within islets with \nboth PKR staining and class I MHC hyper-expression. Finally, we have assessed whether vp1 staining \noccurs independently of insulitis. \n \nMethods  \nSubjects \nFormalin fixed paraffin embedded pancreatic autopsy tissue from 72 patients with recent onset type 1 \ndiabetes mellitus was used in the study. The collection of these cases and the histological findings in \nthe pancreases have been described previously [18] and full ethical permission was obtained for their \nuse. The cases were from many different hospitals and had been fixed in either buffered formalin, \nformol saline, formol saline with added mercuric chloride, or Bouin\u2019s fixative. There had been no \nstandardisation of fixation time. The cases were selected such that nearly all of the pancreatic sections \nstudied contained residual insulin-positive islets. The cohort consisted of 41 female and 31 male \npatients with a mean age of 12.65\u00b11.1years (range 1 to 42 years) and a mean time since diagnosis of \n8.2\u00b14.1 months; (range 0-6 years).  Control autopsy tissues, fixed in a similar variety of fixatives, \nwere 5 culture proven Coxsackie virus-infected neonatal pancreases and hearts; 11 normal neonatal \npancreases (<1 month); 3 normal neonatal hearts; 39 normal paediatric pancreases (age range 6 \nweeks-17 years); 11 pancreases from cystic fibrosis patients with a mean age of 8.1\u00b11.7 years (age \nrange 2-19 years); 69 normal adult pancreases and 25 pancreases from adult patients with type 2 \ndiabetes.  \n \nImmunohistochemistry \nSerial sections (4\u03bcm) were cut from each case and mounted on glass slides coated in (3-\nAminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). Sections were processed and labelled \nusing a standard immunoperoxidase technique for paraffin sections. With the exception of glucagon, \ninsulin and MHC class 1, all other antigens were unmasked by heat-induced epitope retrieval. \nSections to be labelled with anti-PKR and anti-CD45 were heated in 10mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 \nwhile those to be labelled with DAKO anti-enteroviral vp1 (5D8\/1; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), \npolyclonal anti-vp1, or anti-Pan-enterovirus (9D5; Millipore, Livingston, UK) were heated in 1mM \nEDTA, pH 8.0. See Supplementary Table (online) for details of antibody dilutions and sources.  \n \nPrimary antibodies were applied for 30 min at room temperature (except for anti-Pan-enterovirus \n(9D5) and anti-PKR which were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C) and Dako REAL\u2122 Envision\u2122 \nDetection System used for antigen detection. Some slides were processed in the absence of primary \nantibody or with isotype control antisera to confirm the specificity of labelling. Slides were analysed \nby light microscopy. \n \nImmunofluorescence staining \nTo determine the islet cell subtypes infected by enterovirus, double immunofluorescence staining was \nperformed. Anti-insulin, anti-glucagon and anti-vp1 reactivity were detected using an Alexa Fluor \n488-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody, an Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit antibody and an Alexa Fluor \n568 conjugated anti-mouse antibody respectively (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Sections were mounted \nusing Vectashield medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Ca, USA) and were observed using a Zeiss \nLSM510 Meta confocal microscope. \n \nStatistics \nStatistical analysis was performed either by the Chi squared test or Students t-test as appropriate and \nresults were considered significant when p<0.05. \n \nResults \nVp1 staining in the islets of recent-onset Type 1 diabetic patients  \nIn order to confirm the utility of the DAKO enteroviral antibody used previously to identify vp1 \nimmunoreactivity in the pancreas [13, 19] and intestine [20] of patients with type 1 diabetes, we \ninitially examined its reactivity in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, heart and pancreas samples \ntaken from 5 neonates having fulminant, fatal Coxsackie B infection. Cardiac myocytes and many \npancreatic islets from these samples contained cells which were strongly immunopositive for vp1 \n(Figure 1a and Figure3a). By contrast, none of the islets examined in normal pancreas sections \nrecovered from 11 non-diabetic neonates, nor the myocytes in hearts of neonates without myocarditis, \nwere immunopositive for vp1.  \n \nProbing of the pancreases from our cohort of 72 recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients with the DAKO \nanti-vp1 antibody revealed the presence of small numbers of intensely stained cells in multiple islets \nfrom the majority of cases (Figure 1b-c). These immunopositive islet cells were readily \ndistinguishable from the surrounding unstained endocrine cells (which formed the majority in all \ncases) suggesting that the antibody did not label an endogenous islet cell antigen. To facilitate \nquantitative analysis, a case was deemed positive for vp1 when at least one intensely stained \nendocrine cell was present in an islet within any given section. Using this criterion, 44 of the 72 \n(61%) recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases were positive for enteroviral vp1 antigen within the pancreas \n(Figure 1g) and most contained multiple immunopositive cells in a range of islets. Comparison of the \nage and sex of the type 1 diabetes patients between the vp1-positive and vp1-negative cases failed to \nreveal any significant differences. However, the duration of diabetes tended to be lower in the vp1-\npositive group (2.32\u00b10.8 months vs 16.5\u00b18.0 months; p=0.06).  \n \nOccasional islet cell vp1 immunopositivty was detected in the pancreases of 3 of 39 (7.7%) non-\ndiabetic paediatric cases (Figure 1e, g) but this amounted to a total of only 4 endocrine cells among \nthe entire islet population examined. This was significantly lower than that observed in the patients \nwith type 1 diabetes (X\n2\n=29.71, p<0.001). A series of 11 paediatric cystic fibrosis pancreases was also \nexamined for vp1 immunopositivity to determine whether the viral protein is found commonly in \npatients with another pancreatic inflammatory disease. Of the 11 pancreases examined from patients \nwith this disease, 2 contained multiple vp1 positive islets similar to those seen in the type 1 diabetes \npatients (not shown). Importantly, it was discovered upon subsequent examination of the case \nhistories of these patients, that the two with vp1 immunopositivity in the islets, also had diabetes. \nNone of the remaining (vp1 negative) cystic fibrosis cases had diabetes.    \n \nVp1 immunostaining is restricted to insulin-containing islets \nIn the pancreas in recent onset type 1 diabetes approximately 60% of the islets are insulin deficient \nand the remainder contain residual insulin secreting beta cells [18]. An analysis was made of the \ndistribution of vp1 positive cells between insulin deficient islets (IDI) and insulin containing islets \n(ICI) in serial sections from 10 patients with frequent vp1 positive endocrine cells. A total of 342 ICIs \nwere analysed and 269 (78.7%) were found to be positive for vp1.  By contrast, only 16 of 611 (2.6%) \nIDIs showed evidence of vp1 within the plane of the section (Figure 2a).  This finding suggests that \nbeta cells contain the viral protein. A more direct approach to assessing this was double \nimmunofluorescence staining for either insulin or glucagon together with vp1 (Figure 2b). This \nrevealed that staining of the viral antigen was restricted to a minority of insulin-positive cells. These \nresults were verified in 5 separate cases in which an average of 32 islets were examined per section.  \n  \nThe presence of CD45\n+\n immune cells was also examined to determine whether a relationship existed \nbetween vp1 immunopositivity and the extent of insulitis in type 1 diabetes patients. A total of 200 \nvp1 positive ICIs were studied (from 7 patients) and 123 (61.5%) of these showed no evidence of \ninflammation (i.e. they were negative for CD45).  \n \nVerification of islet vp1 staining with other enteroviral antisera \nTo confirm that the DAKO antiserum was detecting enteroviral vp1 in the islets of type 1 diabetes \npatients, the staining pattern was compared with that obtained using a second, polyclonal antiserum \nraised against vp1 (designated Kdf), and an additional pan-enteroviral monoclonal antibody, not \nspecifically directed against vp1 (clone 9D5). Initially these antisera were tested in normal and \nCoxsackie-infected neonatal human heart to verify their specificity and sensitivity. This revealed that \nsimilar regions of the tissue were stained with each antibody in infected tissue (examples for DAKO \nand Kdf are shown in Fig 3) and that staining was absent from normal control hearts. Under optimal \nconditions, the DAKO antiserum appeared to be the most sensitive of the three, since staining was \nmore intense and extensive with this antibody than with the others. It also gave more consistent results \non tissues fixed in a variety of fixatives.  \n \nComparison of staining with the three antisera applied to serial sections of pancreas is presented in \nFigure 4 (a-f) together with a quantitative analysis from 11 patients (Table 1). The images show islets \nfrom two different patients stained with either the DAKO vp1 (Figure 4a, e), Kdf (Figure 4b, f) or 9d5 \n(Figure 4c) antibodies and demonstrate that intensely positive islet cells could be detected in the same \nislets with these reagents. Of the 11 patients studied in detail, 1 Bouin\u2019s fixed case had islets stained \nby all 3 antisera and at least a further 3 had positive immunostaining in ICI with two antibodies. The \nDAKO antiserum appeared most sensitive since it stained one or more of the ICI in all 11 cases.  No \nIDI were stained with any of the antisera. \n \nCorrelation between islet vp1 staining and additional markers of viral infection \nIn the next series of studies, serial sections of pancreas were stained with antibodies to insulin, vp1, \nPKR and MHC-1 in 6 vp1 positive type 1 diabetes patients to determine whether vp1 staining \ncorrelated with other markers of viral infection and autoimmunity. Representative insulin containing \nislets from one of these patients are shown in Figure 5a and a representative insulin-deficient islet is \nalso shown for comparison.  PKR staining correlated with vp1 immunopositivity in 154 of 177 \n(87.0%) ICIs analysed in the type 1 diabetes patients (Figure 5a and b) whereas it was not detected in \nany islets of 5 non-diabetic age-matched control pancreases. PKR staining was only rarely observed in \ninsulin deficient islets. Islet cell MHC-1 hyperexpression was detected in all of the type 1 diabetes \ncases analysed and this correlated with the presence of insulin (Figure 5a). All vp1 positive islets were \nfound to hyper-express MHC-1, but so did many vp1 negative insulin-containing islets.  MHC-1 was \nnot hyper-expressed in any neonatal or paediatric control pancreas. \n \nVp1 staining in sections of pancreas from Type 2 diabetic patients and from non-diabetic adults \nThe study was extended to include pancreas samples recovered post mortem from 69 normal adults \nand 26 patients with type 2 diabetes. Islet endocrine cell immunopositivity for vp1 (DAKO antiserum) \nwas observed in 9 of 69 (13.0%) normal pancreases (Figure 6ai and b). Of 25 type 2 diabetic patients \nanalysed, 10 (40%) contained a range of islets having intensely positive cells (Figure 6aii and b; \nX\n2\n=7.89, p<0.01vs normal pancreas). \n \nA more detailed comparison of the frequency of vp1 positive islets in 10 type 1 and 6 type 2 diabetic \npancreases as well as 7 non-diabetic adult pancreases was performed (Fig 6c). The cases were chosen \nat random among pancreases which had vp1 positive islets. 70\/251 (27.9%) islets contained vp1 \npositive endocrine cells in the 6 type 2 diabetes pancreas sections studied whereas only 15\/210 (7.1%) \nislets from 7 normal adult pancreas contained equivalent cells (Figure 6C; X\n2\n=32.81, p<0.001). This \ncompared with 269\/342 (78.7%) vp1 positive insulin containing islets in the 10 type 1 diabetes cases \nstudied in detail (X\n2\n=152.31, p<0.001; vs type 2 diabetes). In the islets of patients with type 2 diabetes \nislets that were vp1 positive, PKR immunopositivity was also often detected (Figure 5a and 6d). \nHyper-expression of MHC-1 was not seen in any islet from type 2 diabetes patients (Figure 5a) nor in \nnon-diabetic adult pancreases.  \n \nFinally, particularly in some adults, focal pancreatic centroacinar cells in the exocrine tissue and, in \ncertain cases, smooth muscle cells in vein walls, were stained positively by the DAKO anti-vp1 serum \n(Figure 6aiii-iv).  Such staining was occasionally seen, but much less frequently, in the neonatal and \npaediatric pancreases of both diabetic and non diabetic patients, and it was never observed with the \nkdf antiserum in any case studied.  \nDiscussion \nCircumstantial evidence has implicated enteroviral infection in the aetiology of type 1 diabetes but \ndirect support for the hypothesis that islet cell enterovirus infection is a common occurrence in the \ndisease has been more difficult to obtain [1]. However, it was recently reported that the enteroviral \ncapsid protein, vp1, was detectable in a range of beta-cells in 2 of 5 recent onset type 1 diabetic \npatients and in another diabetic patient who had received a pancreatic transplant, but not in 26 non \ndiabetic controls [13]. In order to verify and extend this finding, we have analysed the prevalence of \npancreatic islet vp1 immunopositivity in 72 recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients, most of whom had \ndied at clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis, and in a range of controls. The results reveal a \nprevalence of islet vp1 immunopositivity of ~ 61% in type 1 diabetic patients, with almost no \nequivalent staining in the pancreases of neonatal and paediatric non diabetic controls. Double \nimmunofluorescence studies showed that vp1 staining was confined to beta-cells. Thus, the proposal \nthat vp1 immunopositivity may be common in the insulin-secreting cells of type 1 diabetic patients is \nsupported by this more extensive analysis.  \n \nAn important consideration is the identity of the antigen labelled by the DAKO vp1 antiserum. In the \nliterature the specificity of the DAKO vp-1 antiserum has been assessed by comparing \nimmunohistochemical and enteroviral RNA detection techniques. For example, in a study of heart \nbiopsies of 70 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, enteroviral RT-PCR testing was positive in 25 \nsamples. Seventeen of these had focal staining of cardiac myocytes by DAKO vp1 antiserum while all \nof the RT-PCR negative samples were vp-1 negative on immunohistochemistry. All 45 normal control \nhearts were negative with both techniques [21]. Additionally, RT-PCR for enterovirus was positive in \nsalivary gland biopsies in 7 of 8 patients with primary Sjogren\u2019s syndrome but not in 16 normal \nsalivary glands. In confirmation of this, ductal, acinar and infiltrating inflammatory cells stained \npositively with DAKO anti-vp-1 in the Sjogren\u2019s cases but not in the controls [22].  \n \n We verified that the DAKO vp1 antibody labelled human cardiac myocytes in neonates infected with \na number of different Coxsackie B viruses in vivo, whereas non-infected neonatal heart was \nimmunonegative. However, in common with others [19,23] we also noted that the DAKO antiserum \ncan, under certain conditions, label tissues in which vp1 production is not expected. In particular, our \npreliminary work revealed that, when applied to formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded, sections of \nCoxsackie-infected neonatal mouse organs, this antibody stained some tissues which were reported to \nbe negative for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation [24]. Such tissues included smooth muscle, bone, \ndental and hair follicle epithelium, pancreatic duct and centroacinar cells. Moreover, these tissues \nwere also stained by the antibody in uninfected neonatal mice. Thus, while it is clear that the DAKO \nantibody is a sensitive agent for labelling enteroviral vp1 in a range of tissues in mouse and man, it is \nalso evident that it can label non-infected cells, including, in the pancreas, vascular smooth muscle \nand centroacinar cells. However, it should be emphasized that in uninfected neonatal mice and \nneonatal children the antibody did not stain pancreatic endocrine cells. Thus, in the context of islets of \nLangerhans, the DAKO antibody stained endocrine cells only in control tissues known to be infected \nby virus. \n \nPolyclonal antisera raised against enteroviruses have been shown to cross react with hsp-60 [25] and \nthe tyrosine phosphatase, IA-2 [26]. However, it seems unlikely that the DAKO vp-1 antiserum \nrecognised either of these proteins in the beta cells in this study. IA-2 is present in alpha cells as well \nas beta cells while the vp-1 staining was seen in a minority of beta cells, but not alpha cells. The \nexpression of hsp-60 has been studied in these diabetic samples before [27] and there was no \nequivalent staining of occasional beta cells as described here for vp-1. \n \n \nBecause of the potential for non-specific immunoreactions with the DAKO antiserum and possible \ndoubts about the origin of the virus isolated previously [13, 28] we used two additional antisera raised \nagainst enteroviral proteins to analyse the presence of enterovirus in sections of pancreas. With each \nof these antisera, specific enteroviral immunopositivity was first demonstrated in infected neonatal \nhuman hearts. Both antisera stained endocrine cells in insulin containing islets, which correlated with \nimmunopositivty detected with DAKO anti-vp1 in some, but not all, type 1 diabetic patients tested. \n \nIn an earlier study [13] two additional techniques were used to verify that vp1 immunostaining in \ndiabetic islets represented virus infection. Firstly, virus particles were observed by electron \nmicroscopy, confined to beta-cells, in the same cases as had demonstrable vp-1. Secondly, a strain of \nCVB4 was isolated from one of the pancreas samples and shown to be capable of infecting normal \nhuman islets in vitro, leading to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [13]. Hence, the authors \ndirectly correlated vp1 immunopositivty, as revealed by the Dako antiserum, with the presence of \nactive virus in at least one patient. While this evidence appears persuasive, others [28] have cast doubt \non the origin of the virus strain, by suggesting that the reported RNA sequence analysis implies \npossible contamination with a laboratory strain.  \n \nSince most of the previous studies [13,21,22] were conducted using fresh biopsy tissues, or tissues \nremoved at the time of organ donation, the authors were able to employ EM, RT-PCR or in situ \nhybridization techniques to confirm the validity of the vp1 staining. These options were not open to us \nsince the pancreatic material from patients with diabetes in the present study was collected almost \nentirely retrospectively from autopsies performed hours after the death of patients. In previous work \n[29] attempts were made to detect enteroviral RNA by in situ hybridization in this collection and no \nevidence of infection was found. The poor quality of RNA in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded \nautopsy pancreas, probably the result of early RNA degradation in a tissue rich in RNAse, was \nexemplified in that study by the fact that mRNA for insulin could be detected by in situ hybridization \nin only 29 of the 75 pancreases studied, even though all had insulin containing beta cells as shown by \nimmunohistochemistry. In support of this, very recent work has also failed to detect viral RNA by in \nsitu hybridisation in an autopsy pancreas where evidence of viral protein production was detected by \nimmunohistochemistry [19]. Thus no attempt was made in the present study to repeat the search for \nenteroviral RNA by in situ hybridisation or RT-PCR. Rather, we looked at the production of another \nprotein that is up-regulated in response to enteroviral infection, protein kinase R [30] and found a \nstrong concordance between PKR immunopositivity and that for vp1 in the islets both type 1 and type \n2 diabetic patients. This is arguably the best evidence in the present study that detection of vp1 by the \nDAKO antibody in beta cells is indicative of a persistent enteroviral infection. \n \nWhile staining of vp1 correlated with PKR immunostaining in the islets of patients with type 1 \ndiabetes it was not seen in many of the insulin containing islets where there was hyperexpression of \nclass I MHC on islet endocrine cells. This latter phenomenon has been shown to be intimately \nassociated with interferon-alpha production by beta cells [17] and is a phenomenon unique to type 1 \ndiabetes [31]. Thus, vp1 staining by beta cells does not appear to be directly associated with secretion \nof interferon-alpha and it is unclear why interferon-alpha is produced by beta cells in those islets \nwhich hyperexpress class I MHC [26] but have no demonstrable viral capsid protein.  \n \nIn experimental acute enteroviral myocarditis in mice, it has been reported that viral capsid protein \nwas most easily detectable by immunohistochemistry under conditions when there was an excess of \npositive strand viral RNA over negative strand viral RNA within infected cells. By contrast, if the \ninfection continued into a chronic phase, then the number of positive and negative enteroviral RNA \nstrands per cell became equivalent and capsid protein was less readily demonstrable [32]. On this \nbasis, it is conceivable that a molecular form of virus, that is not readily detectable by \nimmunohistochemistry for vp1, may exist as a chronic infection in many of the beta cells in type 1 \ndiabetes and that, occasionally, production of the whole virus increases, leading to capsid protein \nsynthesis in a small number of beta-cells. If this hypothesis is correct, then our results imply that the \nmolecular form of virus detectable by vp1 immunostaining is also the form that most potently induces \nPKR production, whereas interferon-alpha may be induced by both molecular forms. \n \nExtending the current analysis from paediatric patients to adults revealed additional unexpected \nfeatures. Most surprisingly, 40% of the adult type 2 diabetes cases displayed focal staining for vp1 in \ntheir islets. This intense focal staining pattern was indistinguishable from that seen in the islets of \npatients with type 1 diabetes (though it occurred much less frequently in type 2 diabetes) which might \nsuggest that immunopositivity for vp1 occurs as a consequence of diabetes. Alternatively, these \nresults may indicate that enteroviral infection plays an important role in the pathology of beta-cell loss \nand malfunction in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  \n \nThe latter proposition is consistent with emerging evidence that type 2 diabetes may be associated \nwith islet cell inflammation [33] although it must also be noted that there is no induction of \nautoimmunity in type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, our present finding of production of PKR in consort \nwith vp1 in the islets of patients with type 2 diabetes is consistent with an active response by infected \nendocrine cells to the presence of virus in this disease. Since non-cytopathic infection of beta-cells by \nenterovirus leads to decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion in vitro [13] it is possible that, in a \nperson with obesity and increased insulin resistance, in whom the demand for insulin is raised, such \nan infection may contribute to beta-cell dysfunction and the development of type 2 diabetes, even if \nnot associated with autoimmunity. Our findings could also suggest a similar role for enterovirus \ninfection in precipitating clinical diabetes in some patients with cystic fibrosis. \n \nVp1 staining in islets was found in approximately 10% of non diabetic controls of all ages. This is \nconsistent with studies showing that 4-5% of normal children had enteroviral RNA in their serum [4, \n7, 8] and 11.8% had enteroviral RNA present in faecal samples [34,35]. In addition, it has also been \nshown that a range of enteroviruses can infect human islets in vitro [12,36,37], which is consistent \nwith the pancreas being quite frequently colonised during an enteroviral infection. \n \nThis study has extended recent work [13] to reveal the prevalence of vp1 positivity in beta cells in \ntype 1 diabetes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that enteroviral infection of beta cells at \na young age, in patients with a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes, might precipitate \nautoimmunity to beta cells. The islet reaction to that infection would include production of PKR, \ninterferon-alpha secretion by beta cells and abnormal production of MHC molecules in islets, leading \nto the type 1 form of the disease. Infection by a similar virus, in a person with a different genetic \nbackground, might be associated with PKR production, but if it did not precipitate interferon alpha-\nproduction by beta cells, or any abnormalities of MHC expression in islets, this infection would not be \nassociated with autoimmunity, and in the great majority of patients would lead to no clinical disease. \nHowever, in patients with an already compromised metabolic situation, as a result of insulin \nresistance, it may help precipitate the development of type 2 diabetes. Further studies, including viral \nRNA detection techniques on fresh, organ-donation pancreas samples from patients with recent onset \ndisease, are indicated to confirm the presence and identity of enterovirus strains causing diabetes. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Diabetes UK, JDRF and a Coordinated Action of the European Union (TONECA) for \nfinancial support of this study.

Immunohistochemical analysis of enteroviral vp1 staining in human pancreatic islets.  \nPancreas sections from a Coxsackie-infected neonatal child (a) and two different recent-onset type 1 \ndiabetic patients (b, c) were stained for vp1. A serial section of the islet in (c) has also been \nimmunostained for insulin (f) and shows that most beta cells do not produce vp1. Vp1 \nimmunoreactivity was not observed in islets from the majority of paediatric cases (d). Only 4 \npositively stained islets cells were observed in 3 of 39 paediatric cases, one such cell is shown by the \narrow in (e). The percentage of cases from each subject group that were found to have at least 1 \nintensely stained cell within an islet is shown in (g). The number of positive cases\/ total number of \ncases is quoted above each respective bar. \n \nFigure 2. Enteroviral vp1 production is restricted to insulin-containing beta cells. (a) Analysis of serial \nsections stained for vp1, insulin and glucagon was used to determine the percentage of insulin-\ncontaining islets (ICIs; black bars) and of insulin-deficient islets (IDIs; white bars) that stained \npositively for vp1. The results presented are from 10 recent-onset type 1 diabetic cases which had vp1 \npositive endocrine cells; a total of 342 ICIs and 611 IDIs were analysed. Of these 269 and 16 were \nvp1 positive respectively. (b) Confocal microscopic analysis of representative islets reveals that vp1 \n(red; panels b,c,e,f) co-localised with insulin (green; panels a,c) but not with glucagon (panels d,f). \nThose stained in yellow are double-positive cells (panels c,f). \n \nFigure 3.

Representative islets from two different type 1 \ndiabetic pancreases, a-d, e-f, were stained with DAKO vp1 antibody (a,e), kdf vp1 (b,f), the anti-\nenteroviral antibody 9d5 (c) and insulin (d).  \nFigure 5.  Examination of vp1 immunopositivity, production of PKR and hyper-expression of MHC \nclass I in the islets of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients and a patient with type 2 diabetes.  (a) Two \nrepresentative islets from recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients and one from a patient with type 2 \ndiabetes were stained for insulin, vp1, protein kinase R (PKR) and MHC Class I (MHCI).  The upper \npanel shows an insulin-containing islet (ICI) and the middle panel an insulin-deficient islet (IDI) from \na patient with type 1 diabetes (T1D), while the lower panel shows an islet from a type 2 diabetic \npatient (T2D). In the lower panel note that the same cells within the islet stain with vp1 and PKR on \nthese adjacent sections. (b) Detailed analysis of 177 insulin-containing islets (ICIs) from 6 \nrepresentative vp1 positive type 1 patients demonstrates that vp1 is associated with PKR production in \n154 (87%) of these ICIs. \n \nFigure 6.
