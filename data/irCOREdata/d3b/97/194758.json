Hebden\n(sophiehebden@yahoo.com)\n1 Introduction\nThe Ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n Resonator (IAR) is the term given\nto the vertical structure associated with the decay in plasma\ndensity going from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere,\nwhose existence was first predicted by Polyakov, (1976).\nAlfve\u00b4n waves propagating along the geomagnetic field lines\nare partially reflected from regions of large Alfve\u00b4n velocity\ngradients. The lower boundary region occurs in the iono-\nspheric F-layer. The upper boundary of the IAR corresponds\nto the region where the Alfve\u00b4n waves of interest undergo par-\ntial reflection at the large Alfve\u00b4n velocity gradient caused\nby the rapid decrease in plasma density above the F-layer\ndensity peak, whilst the geomagnetic field strength decreases\nwith altitude more slowly.\nIAR resonance features at high latitudes are observable in\nthe electromagnetic spectra between 0.2 and 5 Hz (The fre-\nquency range of Pc1 waves) (Belyaev et al., 1999). These\neigenfrequencies of the IAR were first observed in 1985 by\nBelyaev et al. (1987) in the form of multiple horizontally\nbanded spectral resonance structures (SRS) in frequency-\ntime plots of mid-latitude magnetic background noise be-\ntween 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz derived from pulsation magnetome-\nter data. They were observed at high latitudes (L\u223c6, where\nL-shell value relates to latitude as L=cos\u22122\u03bbE) by Belyaev\net al. (1999).\nIAR resonance features are manifested in the form of mul-\ntiple maxima and minima in the magnetic field power spec-\ntrum which are quite stable, often lasting for several hours\nuntil fading out or being masked by more intense wave ac-\ntivity. The modulation depth of the power spectrum can be\nup to 50%, and the frequency interval 1f between the peaks\nis generally in the range 0.5\u20133 Hz at mid-latitudes (Belyaev\net al., 2000). They are regularly observed at low and mid\nlatitudes in high time resolution magnetometer data, espe-\ncially at night-time. Belyaev et al. (1990) observed diur-\nnal variations of resonance peak characteristics in one of the\n1712 S. R. Hebden et al.: A quantitative analysis of diurnal evolution\ntwo orthogonal components of the tangential magnetic field\nat the Earth\u2019s surface at the mid latitude station of Nizhny\nNovgorod (L\u223c2.6). The diurnal variation in frequency and\nspacing was proportional to 1\/f0F2, where f0F2 is the crit-\nical frequency of the F2-layer in the ionosphere. The reso-\nnance peaks increased in modulation depth, frequency and\nspacing towards the maximum at midnight and decreased to-\nwards dawn, with resonance features rarely observed during\nthe day. These authors attributed the characteristics of the\nspectral resonance features to the changing parameters of the\nIAR.\nHickey et al. (1996) extended the observation at Nizhny\nNovgorod by reporting detection of banded magnetic spectra\nfrom an L\u223c1.5 station in California. The first evidence for\nthe IAR at high latitudes (Belyaev et al., 1999) was in the\nform of resonance features observed on 4 out of 12 nights\nof data collection using the sensitive magnetometer experi-\nment at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland in November 1993. These au-\nthors qualitatively compared the frequency evolution of the\nresonance features with the change in ionospheric electron\ndensity from EISCAT (Rishbeth and Williams, 1985) inco-\nherent scatter radar data. Resonance features were reported\nby Demekhov et al. (2000) to be \u201ca regular feature\u201d at the\nhigh latitude magnetometer station at Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland\n(L\u223c5.1). These authors presented 4 days of observations\nfrom the stations at Nizhny Novgorod and Sodankyla\u00a8, Fin-\nland, and used a model of the IAR (published in Izvestiya\nvuzov-Radiofizika by Belyaev et al. in 1989) to make quanti-\ntative comparisons of the predicted spectra with the magnetic\nfeatures. They found that the diurnal variation of the spectral\nresonance features could be well explained by the variation\nin the local ionospheric parameters.\nMore recently Yahnin et al. (2003) used continuous ob-\nservations from 1995\u20131999 at the Sodankyla\u00a8 magnetometer\nstation to define the morphology of the IAR resonance fea-\ntures at high latitudes. These authors found the occurrence\nrate (P) of resonance features to be higher in the nighttime\nthan the daytime, and higher in winter than in summer. They\nmade a statistical study on the frequency spacing of the IAR\neigenfrequencies (1f ) and of P , and showed that their diur-\nnal, seasonal and long-term behaviour agreed well with IAR\ntheory predictions based on numerical calculations of the re-\nflection coefficient at the top-side ionosphere. These authors\nconcluded that observations of SRS could be used for esti-\nmation of upper ionosphere parameters and for improving\nthe existing ionosphere models.\nIn this paper, the evolution of the resonant frequencies\nwith local time is quantified for days when they were clearly\nvisible. Spectra from a whole month of pulsation magne-\ntometer data from Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland are considered. To\ninterpret the data, a simple 1-D vertical model was adopted\n(Trakhtengerts et al., 2000) in which the IAR consists of 3\nlayers of constant density. The middle layer represents the\nstanding wave cavity which is bounded below by a conduc-\ntion layer and above by a low density layer leading to the\nwave trapping and resonance features of the IAR. Data from\na co-located ionosonde were combined with the IAR reso-\nnance feature analysis results to calculate IAR model param-\neters which correspond to the effective IAR cavity size and\nthe phase matching structure of the standing wave in the IAR\ncavity.\nThis study confirms the earlier results that the diurnal evo-\nlution of the IAR resonance features is caused by the evo-\nlution of the local IAR parameters via detailed day-by-day\nspectral analysis. It also illustrates the need for experimen-\ntal investigation of the reflection of Alfve\u00b4n waves at the\nlower boundary region of the ionosphere and how this re-\nlates to the ionospheric conductivity. Although this study is\ninconclusive on this point due to a lack of incoherent scat-\nter radar data when IAR resonance features were observed\nin October 1998, it shows that linear relationships between\nthe frequency f and harmonic number N of resonance fea-\ntures enable the reflection characteristics of Alfve\u00b4n waves at\nthe lower boundary to be investigated using the simple IAR\nmodel.\n2 Experimental data and processing method\nOctober 1998 was chosen for this study of the structure of the\nIAR because during this month the University of Leicester\nran some modulated ionospheric heating experiments at the\nTroms\u00f8 HF heating facility (Stubbe et al., 1982) to coincide\nwith overhead passes of the FAST satellite (Carlson et al.,\n1998). In one of the heating experiments, narrow-band elec-\ntric and particle flux signatures were observed by the satellite\nfor about 4 s (Robinson et al., 2000, Kolesnikova et al., 2002,\nCash et al., 2002, Wright et al., 2003). This occurred when\nthe satellite traversed magnetic flux tubes that map down to\nthe heated ionospheric patch. The data were best explained\nby the presence of the IAR with an upper boundary\u223c850 km\nabove the satellite altitude (Cash et al., 2002). Thus any ad-\nditional evidence for the existence of the IAR at similar lat-\nitudes in October 1998 makes the IAR interpretation of the\nFAST satellite data more convincing. By studying a month\nof data it is possible to ascertain how frequently IAR reso-\nnance features can be observed, and the common ionospheric\nconditions occurring during the observations. There are cur-\nrently several pulsation magnetometers located in northern\nScandinavia (see Fig. 1), but only data from the Sodankyla\u00a8\n(SOD) pulsation magnetometer station (67.40\u25e6 N, 26.60\u25e6 E\ngeographic coordinates) were available with high accuracy\ntiming for October 1998.\nFigure 2 provides an example of typical magnetic IAR res-\nonance features seen during the month of October 1998. It\nshows a 12-h colour dynamic power spectrum on 4th Octo-\nber 1998 for the linear east-west (or D component) polariza-\ntion of differential magnetic field. Power spectral density is\nshown in colour scale normalized to a reference frequency\nof 3 Hz. This means that the maximum power occurring in\nthe 3 Hz bin sets the maximum for the colour scale (maxi-\nmum=red). This is plotted as a function of hour of the day (x\naxis) and frequency (y axis). A lower threshold of 40% of the\npeak power was chosen because this produced the clearest\nS. R. Hebden et al.: A quantitative analysis of diurnal evolution 1713\nFigure 1.

The dynamic spectrum was pro-\nduced by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a slid-\ning window of 100 s, and moving it along by increments of\n100 s along the differential magnetic field time series. Thus\nthe frequency resolution is 0.01 Hz and the time resolution is\n100 s. At each time-slip along the data series, the DC com-\nponent in the data within the FFT window is removed, then\nthe window is convolved with a standard Hanning window\n(Lynn, 1984) to minimise the number of terms in the fre-\nquency response of the window. This is effectively a \u201craised\ncosine bell\u201d function applied to 10% of the data points at\neach edge of the window.\nThe magnetic data used throughout this paper were not\ncalibrated for the frequency response of the magnetometer\nbecause the sensitivity of the search coil sensors increases\nwith frequency up to 3 Hz. This is an advantage because the\nweak IAR resonance peaks around 3 Hz are easier to observe,\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nf (Hz)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nPo\nw\ner\n sp\nec\ntra\nl d\nen\nsi\nty\n (p\nT2\n)\nFigure 3.

This is the average of 24 power spectra,\nsmoothed with a boxcar of width 3.\nwhilst the magnetometer is less sensitive to the naturally high\namplitude Pc1 waves at about 0.3 Hz.\nWith reference to Fig. 2, the resonance features appear at\nabout 16:00 UT as 9\u201310 coloured horizontal bands roughly\nequally spaced in frequency, and slowly increasing in fre-\nquency and frequency spacing (1f ) with time towards mid-\nnight. The remaining linear north-south (H component) and\ncircular polarization components (RH and LH components\nwhich are not shown) occur at the same frequencies as the\neast-west component displayed in Fig. 2, but are of slightly\nlower amplitude, not distinguishable as resonance features\nuntil 18:00 UT. The power spectral density in the D compo-\nnent is \u223c10 pT2\/ Hz from 0\u20133 Hz at 18:00 UT (see Fig. 3),\nbut it varies in time differently for each polarization. How-\never, it is possible to use the persistence in time of the reso-\nnance features to detect their presence in the data. Pc1 waves\ncan be seen at almost all times in Fig. 2 at frequencies below\n0.5 Hz. However, true IAR resonance features (with more\nthan one harmonic) are observable in the D component from\nabout 16:00 UT until midnight. The modulation depth be-\ntween peaks and troughs is best determined from a single\ncalibrated differential power spectrum, shown for the D com-\nponent in Fig. 3 for 18:00\u201318:40 UT on 4th October 1998.\nThis plot is the average of 24 individual spectra of 100 s of\ndata, thus it has a time resolution of 40 min and frequency\nresolution of 0.01 Hz. Averaging over 24 spectra removes\nthe ephemeral features in the data leaving the coherent res-\nonance features. It can be seen that the modulation depth\nbetween peaks and troughs is \u223c5\u201310 pT2\/Hz in the range 0\u2013\n3 Hz, or \u223c50% of the peak power at this time.\nDynamic spectra were plotted for every day in October\nexcept 16th October 1998 when there were data gaps. Res-\nonance features of the IAR in the form of multiple har-\nmonic bands that evolve in frequency with time were ob-\nserved on 13 days. Considering the geomagnetic activity\nduring October, resonance features were observed on 9 out\nof 10 days when the average daily Ap<5, and only 4 out of\n20 days when Ap\u22655.

For this day the average Ap was 13.6, although\nthe resonance features occurred during the afternoon when\nthe Ap index dropped to 3 or 4. This corresponded with the\nend of ULF wave activity, and a flattening out of the spec-\ntra after midday. For the 7 days in October 1998 with dis-\nturbed magnetospheric conditions (Ap>20), IAR resonance\nfeatures were never observed since there was intense, highly\nvariable ULF wave activity flooding the spectra and masking\nthe background noise in which the resonance features appear.\nQuantifying the diurnal frequency variation of the IAR\nresonance features is difficult because of the low modulation\ndepth in the harmonic peaks at any instance in time. In at-\ntempts to find a quick and accurate technique to quantify the\nSRS features, two different manual methods were developed\nthat exploit the coherence between consecutive spectra. An\nautomated method was used to compare the change in 1f\nwith time and thus to validate the manual method used for\nthe data analysis.\n2.1 Method 1\nThe first method was based on the spectral resonance feature\nvisualisation used by Belyaev et al. (1999). Each polarization\nwas processed by taking an FFT of a 10-s window of data and\nmoving the window along by 10 s, and then averaging over\n120 spectra. This produced spectra like Fig. 3 with a time\nresolution of 20 min and a frequency resolution of 0.1 Hz,\nwhich were displayed as stack plots to show the diurnal evo-\nlution of the resonance features. Figure 4 is an example of a\nseries of uncalibrated spectra for D component polarization\non 4th October 1998 from 16:40\u201319:00 UT. The IAR reso-\nnance peaks are more easily identifiable in the context of a\nfew hours of stack plots because they are extremely coherent\nin time. The peak frequencies, their amplitudes and uncer-\ntainties were determined for each 20 min spectrum, at each\npolarization using the on-screen interactive cursor clicking\ntechnique. An average of the four polarizations was taken to\ngive the most accurate diurnal evolution of the spectral res-\nonance features. An example of the variation in frequency\nwith time for 8 harmonics in the afternoon of 4th October\n1998 for the H component polarization is shown in Fig. 5,\nwith the error bars given by the uncertainty in judging the\npeak frequencies. The frequency spacing between peaks in-\ncreased by 0.21 Hz from 17:00\u201322:00 UT.\n2.2 Method 2\nTo determine the variation in the frequency spacing between\nharmonics (1f ) with time, an automated method was used\nthat relies on the regular spacing of IAR harmonics in the\nmagnetic power spectra. This method treats the stack plots\nof spectra used in method 1 as mini time series of data con-\ntaining a fixed period wave (since harmonics of the IAR are\nequally spaced in frequency). FFTs of these spectra were\nperformed to obtain \u201cpseudo spectra\u201d. A peak in a pseudo\nspectrum indicates that there are multiple harmonics present\nin the real spectrum, and the inverse of the \u201cpseudo fre-\nquency\u201d of the peak gives 1f . Figure 6 columns 2 and 4\nillustrate the change of the pseudo frequency peak with time.\nTime increases by 20 min per panel going from top to bot-\ntom. The main peak decreases in pseudo frequency with\ntime, thus the pseudo wavelength increases. Therefore the\nspacing of the peaks (1f ) in the real spectra increases by\n0.20 Hz; this matches the value obtained using method 1 to\nwithin 0.01 Hz. Thus this method confirms the result from\nmethod 1 for 17:00\u201322:00 UT on 4th October 1998.\n2.3 Method 3\nThe third technique allows the diurnal evolution of the har-\nmonic frequencies to be quantified (only frequency spacing\nis quantified using the automated method) more quickly than\nmethod 1 and with greater accuracy as a consequence of the\n20 min time resolution of each spectral plot for method 1.\nS. R. Hebden et al.: A quantitative analysis of diurnal evolution 1715\nMethod 3 used dynamic spectra for 12-h sections of data;\nvisualisations like that displayed in Fig. 2. These were plot-\nted on the computer screen for each of the four polarization\ncomponents at maximum pixel resolution so that the reso-\nnance features could be identified interactively with the cur-\nsor. Where a harmonic peak was visible above the back-\nground level, the variation in frequency with time was de-\nfined by about 10 interactive cursor clicks. The long extent in\ntime of the dynamic spectra aided identification of the hori-\nzontally banded pattern within the context of the 12-h period.\nLeast squares regression lines were found from all of the cur-\nsor clicks for each harmonic, and the average found for all\nfour polarizations. The standard deviations of the harmonic\ncursor points about the lines of best fit provide information\nabout the uncertainty involved in the method, and hence the\nuncertainty in the frequency of each harmonic with time.\nThis process is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the resonance features\non 4th October 1998. Panel a) shows where interactive cur-\nsor clicks (represented by black diamonds) are applied along\nthe first 8 harmonics in the dynamic spectrum for the H com-\nponent polarization. Panel b) is a frequency versus time plot\nof the cursor points for 8 harmonics at all four polarizations,\nwith the H component in red, D in yellow, RH in green and\nLH in blue. Panel c) shows the least squares regression lines\nfor each harmonic through the combined polarization cursor\npoints. Their uncertainty is indicated by the dotted lines ei-\nther side of the solid lines, which are one standard deviation\nfrom the least squares regression lines. Method 3 yielded an\nincrease in 1f of 0.20 Hz from 17:00\u201322:00 UT. The agree-\nment of this with methods 1 and 2 validates it as an appropri-\nate method for the task of quantifying the diurnal variation\nof the spectral resonance features.\nResonance features observed over 10 time intervals in Oc-\ntober 1998 were analyzed in detail using method 3. These\n10 were chosen because at least 3 harmonics were visible in\nthe dynamic colour spectra for at least 3 h. Spectral features\nthat do not exhibit at least 3 regularly spaced harmonics may\nnot be caused by wave resonance in the IAR, and time inter-\nvals of less than 3 h are unsuitable for detailed analysis of the\ndevelopment of the IAR over time.\n2.4 Ionosonde measurements\nHourly f0F2 data from the ionosonde at Sodankyla\u00a8 were ob-\ntained for days on which magnetic spectral resonance fea-\ntures occurred. These data sets, co-located with the magne-\ntometer, were used to calculate the diurnal variation of the\npeak electron densities in the F2 region of the ionosphere\nassuming that solar illumination is the main driver of iono-\nspheric plasma density variations. It is reasonable to assume\nthat the density within the IAR varies in the same way as the\ndensity at the bottom of the IAR, given by the F2 peak, and\nthat this can be used to calculate the diurnal evolution of the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity in the IAR which dominates the evolution\nof the IAR eigenfrequencies (adopted by Demekhov et al.,\n2000, Yahnin et al., 2003) (this is shown in the next section).\nThus the analysis of the IAR resonance features in the mag-\n18 UT\n19 UT\n20 UT\n21 UT\n22 UT\n23 UT\n0 1 2 3 4 50 1 2 3 4 5\nFrequency (Hz) Pseuo-frequency (Hz)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5\nFrequency (Hz) Pseuo-frequency (Hz)\nFigure 6.

Columns\n1\u20136 show dates of observation and the approximate observa-\ntion times (in UT) of the resonance features in the magnetic\ndynamic spectra, the number of harmonics seen, the mean\nAp, the range of f0F2 critical frequency values during the\ninterval, and the harmonic spacing (1f ) during these times\nrespectively. Columns 7\u20139 give model IAR parameters de-\nrived from data analysis which will be explained later. All\nexcept one morning interval from 02:00\u201306:00 LT on 4 Octo-\nber 1998 are night-time observations of increasing harmonic\nfrequencies and spacing, typically starting from 18:00 LT\nand fading out after 02:00 LT. Generally more harmonics\nwere visible on days when the average Ap during the ob-\nservation period was low, since the total power in the spectra\nwas lower, making small amplitude signals detectable at the\nhigher frequency end of the spectra despite the drop-off in\nsensitivity of the magnetometer. The resonance features were\nobserved for longer when the Ap was small; a quiet magne-\ntosphere is best for observing relatively weak IAR resonance\nfeatures. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, which is a scatter plot of\nthe duration of the resonance feature observations against the\nmean Ap during this time. A least squares regression line is\nplotted, whose product moment correlation coefficient (Pear-\nson\u2019s r) was good (\u22120.79), indicating a negative relationship\nbetween resonance feature duration and mean Ap.\nS.

Panel a) shows the cursor\nclicked determinations of the harmonic frequencies with time\nfor each polarization. The H, D, RH and LH polarization\ncomponents are plotted in red, yellow, green and blue respec-\ntively. Panel b) shows the diurnal variation in the f0F2 crit-\nical frequency from the ionosonde at Sodankyla\u00a8 in red dia-\nmonds. Where data is missing or uncertain (most commonly\ndue to absorption in a lower ionospheric layer), the data\npoints are linearly interpolated. For data gaps lasting longer\nthan 5 h, linear interpolation is meaningless and the critical\nfrequency is plotted as 0. The error associated with the criti-\ncal frequency is 5% where the uncertainty is quantified on the\nionosonde data tables, and assumed to be about 10% for lin-\nearly interpolated points. The terminator crossings at ground\nlevel and at 100 km altitude above Sodankyla\u00a8 are shown as\nblack and purple dashed lines respectively. The least squares\nregression lines of the cursor points for each harmonic using\nall the polarizations are plotted as solid black lines, and their\nuncertainty (given by the standard deviation of the points)\nare shown in panel c) as dot-dash lines. On some days, the\nmagnetic field strength of the resonance features vary from\none polarization to another, thus the least squares regression\nlines (see panel c)) through the cursor points (in panels a))\nare calculated from less than 4 polarizations. This increases\nthe standard deviation of the points about the least squares re-\ngression lines, making the experimental error larger in deter-\nmining the positions of the resonance features. Panel d) is a\nplot of how the harmonic spacing, 1f , varies with time, cal-\nculated from the linear functions that describe the harmonic\nfrequency variation with time plotted in panel c).\nScatter plots of the harmonic frequencies (f ) versus har-\nmonic number (N) were plotted for each hour when the res-\nonance features were identified. An example of this is given\nin panel e) of Fig. 9, with error bars that represent the un-\ncertainty in frequency shown in panel c). Least squares re-\ngression lines through these points are plotted in different\ncolours for each hour going from purple-yellow with increas-\ning time. For all of the dates analyzed, all of the gradients\nof the lines increase with time except those during the post-\nmidnight time interval, which decrease. The same is true for\nthe intercepts, although the flatness of the resonance features\nobserved on 6 October 1998 made any variation in intercept\nvery small. The product moment correlation coefficients (r)\nfor f versus N at any instant in time vary, but they are gener-\nally very high (the mean values of r during each time interval\nanalyzed are shown in column 7 of Table 1). For example on\n14 October 1998 the average value of r is 0.9997, indicating\nthat there is a near perfect linear relationship between har-\nmonic frequency and harmonic number throughout the reso-\nnance feature time intervals analyzed.\nThe strong linear relationships between harmonic fre-\nquency and harmonic number for all of the time intervals\nthat were studied are consistent with a homogeneous cavity\nmodel used by Trakhtengerts et al. (2000) for the IAR, which\nwas consequently adopted for interpretation purposes. In this\nsimple model, reflection of Alfve\u00b4n waves occurs within the\ntop and bottom layers, and standing waves are set up in the\nmiddle layer.

Panels (f) and (g) show the evolution with time of wave phase factor 8 and effective IAR cavity\nsize, L, respectively.\nnumber N is given by (Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981):\nf = (N +8)vA\n2L\n(1)\nwhere 8 is the wave \u201cphase factor\u201d. This was originally\nintroduced as a constant value of 1\/4. (These authors also\nused (l+h) instead of L in Eq. (1), where H is the thickness\nof the bottom side of the ionosphere and l is the scale of the\nelectron density exponential decay in the upper ionosphere.)\nThe value of8may be controlled by the reflection coefficient\nat the lower IAR boundary, Rlower , which can be written in\nterms of r=6\u03c9\/6p and is given by (Lysak, 1991):\nRlower = r \u2212 1\nr + 1 (2)\nwhere 6\u03c9 the wave conductance 6\u03c9=1\/\u00b50vIAR and 6p is\nthe integrated Pedersen conductivity. If there is a wave node\n(for high ionospheric conductivity) at the lower boundary of\nthe IAR with the reflection coefficient Rlower\u223c\u22121, we ex-\npect the value of 8 to be half integer. For a wave antinode\n(low ionospheric conductivity) with Rlower\u223c1, 8 will be in-\nteger (Lysak, 1991). There is always an antinode at the upper\nIAR boundary. The high and low conductivity cases are il-\nlustrated in panels a) and b) respectively of Fig. 10. This\ndiagram shows the first 3 IAR eigenmodes in each case, and\nhow many fractions of a wavelength are set up in the IAR\ncavity of length L.\nThe gradient of a least squares regression line for f\nagainst N at an instant in time gives, according to Eq. (1),\nK=vA\/2L, and the intercept on the f -axis at an instant\nin time gives K\u03c6. Therefore, the intercept divided by the\ngradient of the least squares regression line at any instant\nin time gives 8. The variation of O\u02c6 with time on 4 Octo-\nber 1998 is plotted in panel f) of Fig. 11, with error bars\ngiven by the combined uncertainty in the intercepts and\nslopes of the f against N plot at each point in time (i.e. (1\n8\/8)2=(1K8\/K8)2+(1K\/K)2). Column 8 of Table 1\nshows the range of values taken by 8 for each time inter-\nval studied and the mean error in these values. The values\nof 8 obtained in this study ranged between 1\/2 and 1 which\nwas expected from theory, if 8 represents the fraction of a\nS. R. Hebden et al.: A quantitative analysis of diurnal evolution 1719\nquarter wavelength that forms a standing wave in addition\nto the integer number of half wavelengths necessary for cav-\nity resonance. Thus 8 acted as a consistency check on the\nmodel.\nThe average value of 8 from all of the time intervals an-\nalyzed is 0.61, which is close to the value expected for high\nconductivity at the lower boundary. The highest value for 8\nof 1.02\u00b10.26 occurred on 30 October 1998 which dropped\nmore dramatically than for any other time interval, ending\nin the lowest value for 8: 0.46\u00b10.10. During this interval\nthe f0F2 frequency underwent the largest change, dropping\nfrom 7 MHz to 3 MHz, and the fOE dropped more than most\nintervals, from 3.5 MHz to 1.75 MHz. This means that the\nplasma density in the E and F regions dropped, reducing the\nPedersen conductivity. However, from the analysis, 8 went\nfrom integer (expected for low conductivity) to half integer\n(high conductivity), counter to what is expected from the-\nory. Preliminary comparisons of the lower boundary reflec-\ntion coefficient (calculated using electron density and tem-\nperature data from the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar) on\n2 days in October 1998 did not show a consistent picture ei-\nther. Thus the value of8 obtained with this simple modelling\ninterpretation of IAR resonance features cannot be used to\ninfer the E region conductivity.\nThe variation of L with time can also be calculated if\nthe variation of vA with time is known. This is provided\nby hourly estimates of the f0F2 critical frequency from the\nionosonde at Sodankyla\u00a8, which measures the peak plasma\ndensity in the F2-layer, and so determines how the density in\nthe IAR varies in time, and hence how the Alfve\u00b4n speed vA\nin the IAR varies with time. Since K is a function of vA and\nL, the variation of L with time is given by vA\/2K.vA was\ncalculated from the f0F2 critical frequency (in MHz) since\nionosondes measure the electron number density (Ne) of the\nF2 layer directly (Ne=1.24\u00d71010\u00d7f0F22):\nvA = B\nfOF2\n\u221a\n1.24\u00d7 1010\u00b50mi\n(3)\nwhere the average mass loading of the field line in the IAR,\nmi is assumed to be 24.7 a.m.u. (calculated using the IRI\nmodel, taking and average over the height range of 100\u2013\n300 km altitude with appropriate ionospheric conditions in-\nput) and B is the average geomagnetic field strength at these\naltitudes. This is expected to yield underestimated values of\nL, because the effective IAR density that affects the trapped\nAlfve\u00b4n waves is smaller than the density of the F2 peak. The\ncalculated variations in L (shown in panel g) for 4 Octo-\nber 1998) simply indicate the variation in the scale size of\nthe IAR with time. The error bars shown in panel g) are\ngiven by the combined uncertainty in the gradients of the f\nagainst Nplots and the f0F2 frequency at each point in time\n(i.e. (1L\/L)2=(1K\/K)2+(1fOF2\/fOF2)2).\nColumn 9 of Table 1 summarises the variation of L for\neach time interval studied. The average value of L from all\nof the time intervals is 530 km.

The gradient of the least squares re-\ngression line through all of the points gives 2L, where\nL=530 km\u00b1150 km, the average scale size and standard de-\nviation of the IAR respectively for all 10 time intervals of\nIAR resonance features studied. The red stars represent data\nfor the sole post-midnight interval (just after dawn) on 4\nOctober 1998 when the f0F2 frequency rapidly increased,\nhence making the IAR size increase rapidly (as described\nabove).\nThis study of IAR resonance features has shown that\nthey are commonly observed in the quiet-time background\nnoise from the Sodankyla\u00a8 pulsation magnetometer; in Octo-\nber 1998 multiple harmonics were observable for about 66 h,\nmost commonly after 16:00 UT which is 1\u20132 h after sunset,\nand sometimes into the early hours of the morning, 1\u20132 h af-\nter sunrise. The longest interval of resonance features lasted\nfor 13 h from 16:00 UT on 3 October 1998 until 05:00 UT\non 4 October 1998. The harmonics are quasi-evenly spaced\nat all times, as shown from the strong linear relationships be-\ntween harmonic frequency and harmonic number.\nThe frequency of each harmonic varies with time of day\nvery slowly and systematically, on average the harmonic\nspacing c increased by \u223c0.06 Hz per hour towards midnight\nand decreased by 0.02 Hz per hour post midnight. The rela-\ntive changes in the fundamental frequency over the time in-\ntervals were calculated, with an average change over all the\ntime intervals of 52%. The relative change in the effective\ncavity size, L was calculated; whose average is 32% over\na time interval of a few hours. This is low compared to\nthe relative change in vA of 61% due to the diurnal varia-\ntion of the plasma density in the F2 layer. This indicates\nthat the diurnal evolution of the IAR harmonic frequencies\nis chiefly caused by the changing Alfve\u00b4n velocity in the F2\nregion of the ionosphere. The Alfve\u00b4n velocity is proportional\nto fOF2\u22121, so as the fOF2 frequency drops rapidly towards\nmidnight and rises more slowly in the morning (see Fig. 9\npanel b)) the IAR spectral resonance features do the con-\nverse. These results support the results published by Belyaev\net al. (1990) who used data from a mid-latitude magnetome-\nter station and an ionosonde. It was also demonstrated quali-\ntatively by Belyaev et al. (1999) using 2 days of data from a\nhigh-latitude magnetometer and electron densities variations\nderived from EISCAT incoherent scatter radar data. How-\never it is not only the Alfve\u00b4n velocity that determines the\nevolution of the IAR eigenfrequencies but also the size of\nthe IAR cavity, L,as discussed by Odzimek, (2004). Yah-\nnin et al. (2003) also calculated the long-term variations of a\nparameter they termed L characterizing the scale of electron\ndensity decrease above the F-layer maximum at Sodankyla\u00a8\nsimilar to L in this paper but without estimating the average\nion massmi in the IAR. They used ionosonde f0F2 measure-\nments and SRS frequency interval 1f from magnetometer\ndata averaged over 3-h intervals. The parameter showed sea-\nsonal variability, peaking in summer months where data was\navailable for nighttime time intervals. During October 1998\nthe diurnal variation of L was not more than 30%, which\nagrees with the results of the present study. Thus, L is a rela-\ntively stable parameter; the diurnal evolution of the harmonic\nfrequencies is most strongly dependent on Alfve\u00b4n velocity,\nsince IAR size is less variable.\nThe relative change in 8 calculated for the time intervals\nof this study was very low, at 20%. With reference to Eq. (1),\nthe values of 8 obtained in this study ranged between 1\/2\nand 1, thus acted as a consistency check on the model. It\nis believed that 8 determines the fraction of a quarter wave-\nlength that forms a standing wave in addition to the integer\nnumber of half wavelengths necessary for cavity resonance.\nThe value of 8 depends on whether the wave reflection at\nthe lower boundary is a node or an antinode, or something\nin between. A preliminary comparison of the diurnal varia-\ntion of 8 and the ionospheric conductivity\/lower boundary\nreflection coefficient was made using 3 h of EISCAT inco-\nherent scatter radar data available during October 1998 when\nIAR resonance features were observed. However, these re-\nsults were not conclusive and further investigation is neces-\nsary on other days when IAR resonance features and radar\ndata coincide.\n4 Conclusion\nSpectral IAR resonance features were successfully identified\nin pulsation magnetometer data from Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland on\n13 out of 30 days in October 1998. The variations in the res-\nonance frequencies over time were quantified and analysed\nin detail for 10 days, using dynamic colour spectra of the\ndata and an interactive cursor clicking technique. Strong lin-\near relationships between harmonic frequency and harmonic\nnumber for all of the time intervals studied enabled a homo-\ngeneous cavity model for the IAR to be adopted to analyze\nthe data further. When the variation of the f0F2 region at\nthe same location was taken into account, the detailed anal-\nysis of magnetic resonance features yielded a parameter that\ndescribes the effective size of the IAR,L. During the time in-\ntervals studied, the average variation of L over the time inter-\nvals studied was 32%, whereas the Alfve\u00b4n velocity calculated\nelectron density in the F2 region of the ionosphere varied by\n61%. Thus the IAR cavity is fairly stable over the 3\u201310 h\ntime intervals studied and over the 30 day interval over which\nIAR resonance features were analyzed during October 1998.\nTherefore the diurnal evolution of the IAR eigenfrequencies\nis caused, in the main, by the changing density of the IAR\nthroughout the day, confirming previous studies of IAR reso-\nnance features and local IAR parameters (Demekhov, 2000,\nOdzimek, 2004, Yahnin et al, 2003). Another IAR parameter\nwas derived from the analysis of the IAR resonance features\nassociated with the phase matching structure of the stand-\ning waves in the IAR, termed the phase factor, 8. 8 varied\nover the time intervals studied by 20% on average, possibly\ndue to changing ionospheric conductivity, although the re-\nsults were inconclusive due to a lack of incoherent radar data\nwhen IAR resonance features are observed. The value of 8\nis thought to depend on whether the wave reflection at the\nS. R. Hebden et al.: A quantitative analysis of diurnal evolution 1721\nlower boundary is a node or an antinode, or something in be-\ntween. Further investigation is necessary on other days when\nIAR resonance features and radar data coincide to determine\nthe relationship between 8 and the lower IAR boundary re-\nflection coefficient.\nAcknowledgements.
