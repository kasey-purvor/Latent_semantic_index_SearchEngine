Buchanan\nCranfield University, School of Management, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, UK\nEmail: David.Buchanan@Cranfield.ac.uk\nThis paper reports the findings of a survey of 250 British managers, exploring their experience and perceptions\nof organization politics. Political behaviour appeared to be common. Most managers viewed political\nbehaviour as ethical and necessary, and aspects of organizational effectiveness, change, resourcing and\nreputation were attributed to political tactics, although 80% had no training in this area. Tactics\nexperienced frequently included networking, using \u2018key players\u2019 to support initiatives, making friends with\npower brokers, bending the rules, and self-promotion. Tactics experienced as rare, but not unknown, included\nmisinformation, spreading rumours, and keeping \u2018dirt files\u2019 for blackmail. A consistent pattern of responses\nconcerning willingness to engage in politics, the need to act ruthlessly and the appropriateness of reciprocity\nwhen faced with political behaviour implies an attitude of \u2018you stab my back, I\u2019ll stab yours\u2019. Findings are\ndiscussed using an \u2018antecedents\u2013behaviours\u2013consequences\u2019 framework of perceived organization politics to guide\nresearch.\nThe knowledge gap\nOrganization politics are a reality in most organizations, and while game-playing might outwardly\nappear to be wasted time, it is necessary in order to secure resources, progress ideas, achieve personal\ngoals and often to enhance one\u2019s standing. It is naive to realistically expect to be able to stand aloof\nfrom organization politics. You may be respected for doing so, but your progress will be limited and\nyou will be seen as an easy target. (Middle manager, manufacturing, male, age 40\u201349)\nFerris et al. (1996, p. 262) argue that the field of organization politics remains largely unexplored, particularly\nwith regard to subjective experience. Studies of perceptions of politics suggest the pervasiveness of such\nbehaviour along with ambivalence towards this aspect of the management role. However, little is known\nabout British managers\u2019 perceptions of organization politics. The focus of this study thus lies with\nthe management experience, exploring the perceived implications for organizational change, individual\nperformance, reputation and career. Has the significance of political behaviour been diluted by the values of\nopenness, honesty and integrity, and through the advocacy of teamwork and compassionate, ethical leadership?\nThe politicized nature of change is widely recognized (Dawson, 2003; Frost and Egri, 1991; Pettigrew,\n1973), but the role of organization politics in change agency is controversial. Voyer (1994) and Peled (1999)\nargue for relevance, Ferris and King (1991) and Stone (1997) argue for avoidance, Kumar and Thibodeaux\n(1990) link the intensity of political activity to scale of change, and Cobb (1986) advocates a diagnostic\napproach to organization development interventions. One aim of this research, therefore, is to explore\nBritish managers\u2019 perceptions of these issues. A second aim is to identify further lines of enquiry, through\ndeveloping a framework linking the perceived antecedents of organization politics, through political\ntactics, to perceived consequences. Most previous research on perceptions of organization politics is rooted in\na positivist perspective, seeking to develop a generalizable model of the triggers, nature and outcomes of\npolitical behaviour. This study, in contrast, is based on a constructivist perspective. The resultant\n\u2018antecedents\u2013behaviours\u2013consequences\u2019 framework thus reflects the interpretation of these links as they are\nperceived by respondents. This framework does not represent an empirically testable model in a positivist\nsense, but instead codifies the \u2018actor-theory-in-use\u2019 of the management respondents in this study.\nThe lack of evidence may be attributed to the sensitive nature of the topic, inhibiting research access and\ncandid responses. Madison et al. (1980) advise researchers to cloak the term with an appropriate\neuphemism, as it is \u2018too sensitive for use in direct investigations\u2019. In feeding back to management her\nanalysis of internally authored and politically motivated accounts of change, depicting the company\u2019s\norganization development function in a pivotal light, O\u2019Connor\u2019s (1995) management contact described her\naccount as shocking, outrageous and unacceptable, and never met with her again. A further inhibitor may\nlie with language. \u2018Machiavellian\u2019 is an insult, not a compliment, implying the use of cunning, devious,\nmanipulative, underhand tactics. Calhoon (1969) describes political tactics as \u2018unsavoury\u2019. Keen (1981)\nobserves that politics is equated with \u2018evil, corruption, and blasphemy\u2019. Ferris and King (1991) describe\npoliticized decision-making as \u2018a walk on the dark side\u2019, echoed in Egan\u2019s (1994) \u2018shadow side\u2019 of manage-\nment. Chanlat (1997) describes politics as a \u2018social disease\u2019. It is hardly surprising that Jackall (1988)\ncriticizes the \u2018emotional aridity\u2019 of managers who compromise a caring ethic by playing political games.\nField research in this area is thus problematic. Organization gatekeepers may dismiss requests to explore\ncompany politics; managers may not reveal tactics to strangers who will publish their findings. These issues\nhave been addressed using safe research methods such as self-report questionnaires (Gandz and Murray,\n1980; Vigoda, 2003), student respondents (Drory and Romm, 1988) and indirect studies of work attitudes\nand stress in university employees (Ferris et al., 1996). The study reported here used a survey instrument but\nwas based on a constructivist-interpretive epistemology concerned not with measurement and covariation\nbut with understanding how constructs and relationships are experienced and perceived by respondents.\nTerminology, evidence, theory\nThe literature of organizational power and politics is extensive, and is broadly divided between\nmacro- and micro-political approaches (Vigoda, 2003). Macro perspectives address structural bases of\norganizational power and the role of coalitions in promoting collective agendas (Bacharach and Lawler, 1981;\nHickson et al., 1971; Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995; Pfeffer, 1992). Dominated by a positivist\nperspective, micro approaches focus on individual behaviour, relationships and perceptions (Burns, 1961;\nFerris et al., 1996; Gandz and Murray, 1980; Kacmar and Ferris, 1991; Perrew\u00e9 et al., 2000).\nExploring perceptions of middle and senior managers, the research reported here adopts a micro\napproach, and the following overview focuses on three aspects of the relevant literature. The first concerns\ndefinitions of organization politics. The second concerns studies of the subjective experience of politics.\nThird, theoretical implications are considered, with regard to the perceived antecedents or triggers,\nbehaviours or tactics, and consequences or outcomes of political behaviour. This \u2018antecedents\u2013behaviours\u2013\nconsequences\u2019 framework is subsequently used to explore the implications of the findings of this study.\nTerminology\nThe absence of a common definition of organization politics is a long-standing concern, and commentators\ncontinue to note the lack of agreement (Drory and Romm, 1990; Ferris et al., 2002a). Kacmar and\nCarlson (1997, p. 656) argue that \u2018Only when consensus is reached about what organizational politics is\nand how it should be measured will the field be advanced\u2019. Points of contention concern distinguishing\n\u2018political\u2019 from \u2018non-political\u2019 actions, the treatment of self-interest as a defining characteristic, and the\ninevitably damaging nature of politics. Allen et al. (1979, p. 77) define politics as \u2018acts of influence to enhance\nor protect the self-interest of individuals or groups\u2019. Mintzberg (1983, p. 172, 1985) defines politics as\n\u2018individual or group behaviour that is informal, ostensibly parochial, typically divisive, and above all, in the\ntechnical sense, illegitimate \u2013 sanctioned neither by formal authority, accepted ideology, nor certified expertise\u2019.\nValle and Perrew\u00e9 (2000, p. 361) regard political behaviour as \u2018the exercise of tactical influence which is\nstrategically goal directed, rational, conscious and intended to promote self-interest, either at the expense\nof or in support of others\u2019 interests\u2019.\nThere are problems with the definition features involving influence, self-interest and damage. First, as\nMangham (1979) and Astley and Sachdeva (1984) observe, all routine social exchanges entail\nmutual influence, and every interaction could thus be interpreted as political. An influence-based definition,\ntherefore, does not readily distinguish political from non-political behaviour. Indeed, attribution theory\nsuggests that it is important for managers to avoid having their actions labelled with political intent, and it\nmay be necessary to create the impression that goals are selfless and non-political. Successful manipulation\nmay be that which attracts attributions of legitimate motives (Allen et al., 1979, p. 82). Ferris et al.\n(2000, p. 30) thus define political skill as \u2018an interpersonal style construct that combines social astuteness\nwith the ability to relate well, and otherwise demonstrate situation- ally appropriate behaviour in a\ndisarmingly charming and engaging manner that inspires confidence, trust, sincerity, and genuineness\u2019.\nFerris et al. (2002b, p. 111) suggest that skilled political actors are those who are able to disguise their self-\nserving intent. A second problem is that political tactics can be used to promote either or both individual and\norganizational interests (Buchanan, 1999; Harrison, 1987). If political tactics can generate corporate\nbenefit as well as personal gain, then definitions that regard only overtly self-interested acts as categorically\npolitical are unhelpful.\nA third related issue concerns the widespread portrayal of organization politics in negative terms. Klein\n(1988, p. 1) argues that the claim that organizations are political is \u2018a myth propagated and entertained\nto address various needs of organizational members\u2019. Accepting this myth makes it self-perpetuating, and\npolitical behaviour should instead be eliminated. Eisenhardt and Bourgeois (1988) argue that political\nbehaviour in a top management team is associated with poor performance, by creating inflexibilities\nand communication barriers, restricting information flows, and consuming time. Zaleznik (1997) distinguishes\nbetween \u2018psycho- politics\u2019 and \u2018real work\u2019. Personnel decisions, such as selection and performance\nevaluation, should be depoliticized, according to Ferris and King (1991). Ferris and Kacmar (1992) discuss\n\u2018destructive opportunism and dysfunctional game playing\u2019. Voyer\u2019s (1994, p. 84) study of a computer\ncompany concluded that politics were \u2018mostly dysfunctional\u2019 and that management should \u2018step in and\nreduce the level of politics\u2019. According to Stone (1997), eradicating organization politics is a management\nduty.\nSome commentators, however, argue that politics are useful. Mangham (1979, p. 16) observes that\nreasonable people often disagree, with regard to both ends and means, and can thus be expected \u2018to fight for\nwhat they are convinced is right and, perhaps more significantly, against that which they are convinced is\nwrong\u2019. Butcher and Clarke (1999) view politics as \u2018battles over just causes\u2019, in which debate sharpens the\nquality of decisions. Gandz and Murray (1980) found that organization politics was considered functional\nin terms of careers and power-building. Harrison (1987) argues that political behaviour can be used to\ncounter the use of legitimate tactics to achieve undesirable ends, and to help implement decisions reached by\nlegitimate means. Frost and Egri (1991) argue that political struggles play a role in resolving\ncompeting perspectives and interests in the context of organizational changes. McClelland and Burnham\n(1995) distinguish between institutional (socialized) and personal uses of power, the latter for personal gain,\nthe former in the interests of group and corporate goals, potentially involving self- sacrifice. For Keen (1981)\nand Hardy (1996), organizational power and politics provide the dynamic for the implementation of\nstrategic change. The history of conflicting interests, alignments and negotiations, argue Bacharach and\nLawler (1998), is the history of change. For Provis (2004, p. 233) the widely varied circumstances of political\nbehaviour mean that the claim \u2018politics is always bad\u2019 is \u2018an easy view that we can set aside\u2019.\nThe debates concerning terminology and the functional or dysfunctional properties of organization politics\narise in a positivist perspective, concerned with operationalizing core concepts, developing valid and stable\nmeasures, establishing covariation and building generalizable models. From a constructivist perspective,\nthe definitions and assessments that matter are those of organizational members.\nSubjective experience\nWhat is already known about the subjective experience of organization politics? In one of the first studies\nin this field, Gandz and Murray (1980) found from their survey of 400 American managers that 90%\nregarded politics as commonplace, and 89% said that executives had to be skilled politicians. However,\n55% said that politics impeded efficiency, and 50% argued that management should eliminate politics.\nAllen et al. (1979; Madison et al., 1980) interviewed 87 senior and middle managers from 30 Californian\nelectronics companies. Political tactics mentioned most frequently were blaming others, selective\ninformation, creating a favourable image, developing support, ingratiation, creating obligations, rewards,\ncoercion and threats, associating with influential individuals, and forming powerful coalitions. In addition, 60%\nof respondents said that political behaviour was either \u2018frequent\u2019 or \u2018very frequent\u2019. While 60% agreed\nthat political behaviour can advance careers, respondents were unanimous that politics can harm\nindividuals, through loss of job, power, strategic position and credibility. However, 45% claimed that politics\nimpeded goal achievement, and a third claimed that politics resulted in the misuse of resources. Given this\nblend of outcomes, Madison et al. (1980, p. 93) describe politics as a \u2018two-edged sword\u2019.\nDrory and Romm (1988) asked 156 employees (also Israeli university and college students) to assess the\npolitical nature of 15 critical influencing incidents, based on \u2018definitional elements\u2019 of politics, including\ninformality, conflict, acting against the organization, power attainment, and concealed motives (see Drory\nand Romm, 1990). The argument that all behaviour is political was not supported. Formal influence\nattempts, and the presence of conflict, were not necessarily seen as political (conflict can be resolved by\nother means). Perception of behaviour as political appeared to depend on characteristics of the\nsituation and the observer; managers perceived those definition elements as less political than employees in\nnon-supervisory positions.\nExploring links between organization politics and job attitudes, Drory (1993) surveyed 200 supervisors and\nemployees in five Israeli organizations. Pilot interviews with 25 employees were used to develop a measure of\n\u2018political climate\u2019 based on key decisions affecting task and budget allocations, performance appraisals and\norganization structure, and survey respondents were asked to indicate whether these decisions were\ninfluenced by political factors. The findings suggest that lower status employees, lacking the power and\ninfluence to benefit from \u2018the political game\u2019, view politics as frustrating, but higher status employees did not\nassociate politics with job dissatisfaction. Drory argues that political behaviour is an entrenched\norganizational feature, that in some circumstances this may be an appropriate aspect of decision-making,\nthat negative outcomes cannot always be avoided, and that further research into political consequences\nis required.\nFerris and Kacmar (1992) report two studies linking perceptions of politics to contextual and personal factors.\nThe first involved 264 managers and employees from three organizations. A \u2018perception of politics\u2019\nmeasure included the incidence of favouritism, keeping the boss happy, avoiding criticism, and forming \u2018in\ngroups\u2019. Those at lower levels perceived a higher degree of politics than those at higher levels, and the\nperception that the workplace was political was again associated with job dissatisfaction. The second study\ninvolved 95 hospital nurses and their supervisors, who completed a questionnaire measuring organization\npolitics, job satisfaction, job and work environment factors, and personal influences. Findings suggest that\npolitics can have positive individual and organizational consequences. The authors conclude that\nresearch should adopt a neutral perspective, exploring links between political proficiency and job- and\ncareer-related rewards (Ferris and Kacmar, 1992, p. 113). However, using a Machiavellian personality\nassessment (the \u2018Mach IV\u2019 from Christie and Geiss, 1970), Graham (1996) found that \u2018high Mach\u2019 managers\ndid not have more successful careers (defined by salary) than \u2018low Machs\u2019.\nFerris et al. (1996) explore the links between politics and dissatisfaction, anxiety and stress, using a\nquestionnaire returned by over 800 nonacademic university employees. Perceptions were measured using a 40-\nitem scale with items such as \u2018favouritism rather than merit determines who gets ahead around here\u2019 and \u2018I\nhave seen changes made in policies that only serve the purposes of a few individuals\u2019. Centralization\n(concentrating power at the top) was positively related to perceptions of politics, and formalization\n(reducing uncertainty and ambiguity) was negatively related. Those who saw their organization as highly\npolitical showed higher levels of anxiety and lower satisfaction with both job and supervision. Lower level\nemployees, and those who rated their career opportunities as low, perceived higher levels of politics, and\nmale respondents saw more political behaviour than female. Little is known about gender differences in\norganization politics. However, from her interview study of 55 senior female American managers, Main-\niero (1994, p. 19) found that, while most initially denied that political skill had contributed to their career\nsuccess, they had actually progressed by experience through a \u2018seasoning process\u2019, following which they were\npractising \u2018political skill at a very high and subtle level\u2019.\nOur understanding of perceptions of politics thus relies primarily on surveys of mixed occupational groups of\nAmerican and Israeli employees and managers. The evidence suggests that, while the incidence of\nbehaviours perceived to be political is high and political tactics are seen to generate both positive and\nnegative individual and organizational outcomes, most managers dislike this dimension of their role.\nTheoretical implications\nFerris and Kacmar (1992) argue that organization politics is a relatively under-theorized field. Bacharach\nand Lawler (1998) note that the literature is fragmented, with commentators adopting unique\nperspectives, with no core set of problems to form the basis for theoretical debate. Consequently, there\nis no cumulative tradition leading to the development of a \u2018political theory of organizations\u2019. Perhaps\nthe most influential perspective in this regard has been the model of perceptions of organization politics\ndeveloped by Ferris et al. (2002a, p. 235), hypothesizing how a range of outcomes, such as satisfaction,\nwithdrawal, trust, performance and citizenship, depend on perceptions of politics that in turn depend on a\nrange of organizational, environmental, demographic and personality factors. That model, and\ncommentary reviewed here, reflects an \u2018antecedents\u2013behaviours\u2013consequences\u2019 framework, linking triggering\nor precipitating conditions, with political tactics or strategies, to a range of individual and organizational\noutcomes. Conceptualizing this approach in a simplified three-step framework facilitates comparisons\nbetween positivist studies of perceptions of politics and the constructivist perspective adopted in this research.\nThus, while the model of Ferris et al. (2002a) seeks to identify a generalizable set of causal links, the\nframework developed through the study reported here seeks instead to codify how the links between\nantecedents, political behaviours and consequences are understood by organization managers.\nWhile most perspectives attribute political behaviour to the pursuit of self-interest, Chanlat (1997) argues\nthat triggers also lie with personal ambition, the prevalence of unstructured problems (which cannot be\nresolved through simple decision rules), and structural differentiation (generating competition for resources).\nThe contingency model of Kumar and Thibodeaux (1990) locates the triggers of political behaviour with the\nsignificance of organizational change. First-level change in this model involves improving effectiveness.\nSecond-level change involves the introduction of new perspectives. Third-level change concerns organization-\nwide shifts in values and working practices. The more significant the change and its implications, the\ngreater the political involvement required by the change agent. Kumar and Thibodeaux thus argue that,\nwhile first- and second-level changes require political awareness and facilitation respectively, third-level\nchange entails political intervention, which may involve stimulating debate, gaining support from key\ngroups, and covert manipulation (tactics which they accept may be \u2018ethically objectionable\u2019 but which reflect\nthe \u2018distasteful reality\u2019 of organization politics).\nFerris and Kacmar (1992), Drory (1993) and Ferris et al. (1996) variously attempt to model links between\nperceptions of political behaviour and consequences for job attitudes. Allen et al. (1979), Madison et al.\n(1980) and Ferris and Kacmar (1992), along with Kumar and Thibodeaux (1990), identify political\ntactics which potentially lead to individual and organizational consequences. Perrew\u00e9 et al. (2000) argue that\npolitical skill, through improving interpersonal control and feelings of efficacy and self-confidence, reduces\nmanagement role stress.\nTable 1 summarizes the strands of this commentary concerning reported antecedents or triggers of\norganization politics, the behaviours or tactics deployed, and the consequences or outcomes, and is\nbased on Allen et al. (1979), Mangham (1979), Madison et al. (1980), Gandz and Murray (1980), Keen\n(1981), Harrison (1987), Drory and Romm (1988), Eisenhardt and Bourgeois (1988), Drory and Romm\n(1990), Kumar and Thibodeaux (1990), Ferris and King (1991), Frost and Egri (1991), Ferris and Kacmar\n(1992), Drory (1993), Voyer (1994), McClelland and Burnham (1995), Ferris et al.

(2000), Ferris et al. (2002a, p. 235), Vigoda (2003) and\nProvis (2004). A distinction is made between individual and contextual antecedents, suggesting that\npolitical behaviour can be triggered by factors other than self-interest. The summary of reported tactics\nindicates a broad behaviour repertoire. The individual and organizational consequences, functional\nand dysfunctional, are also varied. While this tabulation implies testable causal links across the framework,\nit is not presented in support of such claims. Rather, this tabulation serves, first, to illustrate the range of\npotential antecedents, behaviours and consequences of political behaviour, and second, as a basis for\ncomparison with \u2018actor-theory-in-use\u2019 concerning perceived antecedents, behaviours and consequences as\nthese appear to be understood by respondents in the research reported here.\nTable 1.

First,\nas indicated earlier, political behaviour is a socially constructed phenomenon (Ferris et al., 2002a, p.\n211), and researcher-derived definitions are thus of secondary importance to the definitions and interpreta-\ntions of respondents. Second, as behaviour only becomes \u2018political\u2019 when actors or observers label it as such, a\nconstructivist orientation rejects the distinction between perceptions of politics and actual political behaviour\n(Ferris et al., 2002a; Valle and Perrew\u00e9, 2000; Vigoda, 2003). The operationalization of actual political\nbehaviour in the positivist tradition relies on the influence tactics identified by Kipnis et al. (1984). This\nmeans that, for example, \u2018rational appeal\u2019 (providing information), \u2018assertiveness\u2019 (giving an order) and\n\u2018exchange\u2019 (swapping favours) are categorically political behaviours, although actors in a given context\nmay not always understand or label those actions in that way. The same argument applies to the categorical\ndistinction between \u2018proactive\u2019 and \u2018reactive\u2019 defensive political behaviours (Valle and Perrew\u00e9, 2000). Other\ncommentary (e.g. Buchanan and Badham, 1999; Schrijvers, 2004) suggests that managers use a range of\nmethods for distracting, subverting, delegitimating, blocking, delaying, networking, positioning, coalition\nbuilding, outmanoeuvring and otherwise promoting initiatives at the expense of others in addition to more\nconventional influence tactics. Third, the survey approach adopted for this study makes no claims to\ndevelop \u2018valid and stable measures\u2019 of key constructs. Instead, the objective is to explore patterns in\nexperiences and perceptions, in order to develop a better understanding of how managers view and\ninterpret political behaviour, its triggers and its outcomes. Echoing Mohr\u2019s (1982) critique of variance\nperspectives in organizational behaviour, a constructivist orientation suggests that measures of ambiguous and\nsocially constructed phenomena, such as organization politics, are invariably unstable, and that observed\npatterns may only apply to particular respondent groups for a limited time. Fourth, this constructivist\napproach seeks to codify the \u2018actortheory-in-use\u2019 of management respondents, and not to develop a general\ncausal model.\nConsequently, this paper reports the findings of a survey of over 250 British managers. While a self-report\nquestionnaire is not the first method of choice for qualitative constructivist research (Stoker, 2003), this\napproach has the advantages of generating a sizeable sample without having to negotiate organizational access,\nwhile providing confidentiality to encourage candid responses and facilitating comparison of results with\nprevious survey-based research. The study was based on a purposive opportunity sample, using eight groups\nparticipating in management development programmes directed by the researcher. In contrast to many\nprevious studies that have sampled across organizational levels, respondents here were middle and senior\nmanagers, and the probability of these managers having experience of organization politics was high. Care\nwas taken not to pre-sensitize respondents to the survey contents, and where this was not possible the\ninstrument was not administered.\nThe survey instrument guaranteed anonymity and was designed for ease of completion, with five sections.\nThe first section asked respondents to rate 18 behaviours in terms of how often they had been experienced.\nThose items were not derived a priori on theoretical grounds or from literature (such as the perception of\norganization politics scale designed by Kacmar and Ferris, 1991), but relied on a series of tactics that\nmanagers themselves had previously identified as examples of political behaviour (Buchanan and\nBadham, 1999).\nTwo sections next contained 30 Likert-scaled items addressing general perceptions of organization politics.\nFourth, a further 15 Likert-scaled items considered aspects of the personal, organizational and change-\nrelated consequences of political behaviour. Finally, respondents were asked for background and context\ninformation (gender, age range, management level, sector, nationality, experience of change management,\ntraining in politics, qualifications). Items that could provide identity cues were excluded. In addition,\nfive \u2018true or false\u2019 items explored sensitive issues relating to interpersonal harm. A \u2018comments box\u2019\ninvited open remarks; around 10% of respondents used this opportunity. The sample characteristics were\n\uf0b7 252 respondents;\n\uf0b7 from over 107 organizations (some respondents withheld employer\u2019s name);\n\uf0b7 46% male, 54% female;\n\uf0b7 68% public sector, 32% private sector;\n\uf0b7 44% senior managers, 38% middle managers, 15% professional, 3% \u2018other\u2019;\n\uf0b7 78% had no training in dealing with organization politics;\n\uf0b7 15% indicated that change management was their full time role;\n\uf0b7 86% regarded change management as one dimension of their role;\n\uf0b7 88% said their organization was under external pressure to change.\nOne evident sample bias concerns public sector dominance. However, sectoral differences in responses\nwere not detected. One explanation is that the experience of politics is not sector- dependent. Vigoda-\nGadot and Kapun (2005) found that public sector employees view their organizations as more political,\nunfair and unjust than private sector employees, but their respondents included a cross-section of\noccupations rather than focusing on managers. Respondents for the study reported here, in contrast, were\nmanagers recruited through management development programmes, suggesting a bias for career mobility,\nreinforced by the observation that over 70% had a university degree and over 50% had a management\nqualification. The absence of sector differences may also be explained by the exchange of managers between\nsectors and by responses based on general experience rather than on one organization. Most respondents also\nhad experience of, and consequently a professional interest in, organizational change.\nFindings\nAs this survey generated nominal and ordinal-scale data, only frequency distributions and cross-\ntabulations are reported; no further statistical analysis was appropriate. Five main themes emerge, concerning\n\uf0b7 the management experience;\n\uf0b7 opinions and beliefs;\n\uf0b7 organizational effectiveness and change;\n\uf0b7 performance, reputation and career;\n\uf0b7 gender differences.\nThe management experience\nThe experience of politics seems to be frequent, visible and sometimes painful. Only 12% agreed that \u2018my\norganization is relatively free of politics\u2019, and only 17% agreed that \u2018I don\u2019t see much political behaviour\nbecause it happens behind closed doors\u2019. In contrast with previous studies, there were no job level differences\nin responses to those items (and no gender or sector differences either). Political behaviour was not seen as a\nsenior management preserve; 83% agreed that \u2018politics is played at all organizational levels\u2019. It is not\nsurprising, therefore, that 84% agreed that \u2018I am prepared to play politics when necessary\u2019, 87% agreed that\n\u2018politics is a natural part of the management job\u2019 and 93% agreed that \u2018most managers, if they want to\nsucceed, have to play politics at least part of the time\u2019. However, over 70% said that they had been hurt by the\ntactics of others.\nThe survey sought to establish the perceived frequency of 18 political behaviours. The results suggest a\nranking, produced by considering first the response frequencies for \u2018very often\u2019, then the combined frequencies\nfor \u2018very often\u2019 and \u2018often\u2019, and finally the aggregated frequencies for \u2018very often\u2019, \u2018often\u2019 and \u2018sometimes\u2019\nfor each tactic. This indicates three categories of more common, less common and rare tactics. At least 68%\nof respondents said that they had experienced all but three of those tactics at least \u2018sometimes\u2019. Five\nbehaviours were perceived as occurring more frequently: building a network of useful contacts, using\n\u2018key players\u2019 to support initiatives, making friends with power brokers, bending the rules to fit the\nsituation, and self- promotion. Three tactics were rated as relatively rare: using misinformation to confuse\nothers, spreading false rumours to undermine others, and keeping \u2018dirt files\u2019 to blackmail others. These\nresults do not indicate the actual incidence of political tactics, but reflect management perceptions of how\noften such behaviours occur. Asked whether \u2018my organization would benefit from a higher level of\norganizational politics\u2019, only 8% agreed. Whatever the incidence of political behaviour, it appears that\nmost managers consider that to be too high, confirming previous studies showing that increases in the\nperceived level of politics are linked to lower levels of job satisfaction, among employees in general\n(Harrell-Cook, Ferris and Dulebohn, 1999, p. 1095).\nOpinions and beliefs\nRespondents were asked to indicate which of four statements most accurately reflected their opinion of\norganization politics (Table 2). Almost two- thirds saw politics as an aspect of their role which they had to\nunderstand, but which they preferred to avoid. There were no job level differences in response to these\nitems. However, women were more likely to choose \u2018understand but avoid\u2019 (69%) than men (56%), who\nwere more likely to respond with \u2018necessary to play\u2019 (38% compared with 24%). Only 27% agreed that\n\u2018winning the political game is an intensely satisfying personal experience\u2019 (with no gender or job level differ-\nences). Asked if \u2018political behaviour is unethical\u2019, only 12% agreed (2% strongly), with 67% in disagreement.\nConsequently, 88% of respondents felt either that political behaviour was unethical or were unsure.\nNevertheless, two comments described politics as \u2018evil\u2019.\nOrganization politics is a \u2018necessary evil\u2019 but need not necessarily be seen as a wholly negative\nconcept. Often it is the informal route by which legitimate objectives are achieved. In my experi-\nence, organizational politics is a fact of life. (Senior manager, manufacturing, male, age 30\u201339)\nI dislike it intensely, but recognize it as an evil others make me engage in. (Middle manager, public\nsector hospital, male, age 30\u201339)\nTable 2\nI don\u2019t want to be involved in organization politics, but\nit is necessary to understand what is going on 63%\nI believe it is necessary to play politics to achieve my\nobjectives and enhance my reputation 31%\nI play politics because it is challenging and fun and is an\nimportant motivator for me 3%\nI ignore politics because it is unethical, demotivating,\nunacceptable and would damage my reputation 3%\nAre political tactics considered inappropriate in some circumstances? Around 80% indicated that they were\nnot prepared to hurt others with political tactics, and over 80% denied that they had hurt others in this\nway. However, there were interesting gender differences in responses to these \u2018true\u2013false\u2019 items. Reflecting\nconventional \u2018tough and tender\u2019 stereotypes, a higher proportion of men said that they were prepared to hurt\nothers to achieve personal and organizational goals, and men were more likely to admit that they had\nhurt others. However, women were more likely to agree that playing politics had contributed to their\ncareer (Table 3).\nNot all political behaviour is a source of discomfort; 65% agreed that \u2018some managers play politics just\nfor fun\u2019. On the item \u2018most managers dislike playing politics\u2019, the sample was divided, with only 17%\nagreement, 34% unsure and 50% in disagreement (2% strongly). Asked whether \u2018life without organization\npolitics would be boring\u2019, 38% agreed (with 21% unsure, 41 % in disagreement), and only 32% agreed that\n\u2018my ideal organization is one with no politics\u2019 (with 21% unsure and 48% in disagreement). It thus appears\nthat between one-third and a half of respondents held broadly positive views of organization politics.\nWith 81% and 75% agreement respectively that \u2018I am prepared to play politics when necessary\u2019\nand \u2018I engage in political behaviour when necessary to achieve my objectives\u2019, responses to two additional\nitems indicate a more calculating perspective. For example, 72% agreed that \u2018a manager has to be ruthless\nsometimes\u2019, and 89% agreed (16% strongly) that \u2018those who use political tactics should expect to have\nsimilar tactics used against them\u2019 (with no gender differences in responses to those items). This\nconsistent response pattern suggests that political tactics are considered justified in some contexts, that\ncausing harm is less acceptable and that \u2018ruthless reciprocity\u2019 is perceived appropriate, implying an\nattitude of \u2018you stab my back, I\u2019ll stab yours\u2019. How can willing ruthlessness be reconciled with the\ndesire to avoid hurting others? This sentiment is perhaps captured by the following comment.\nWhile I \u2018agreed\u2019 with it, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with the word ruthless, as there is an element\nof vindictiveness implied by the word. (Senior manager, public sector hospital, male, age 30\u201339)\nTable 3\nMale \u2018true\u2019\nresponse (%)\nFemale \u2018true\u2019\nresponse (%)\nMy willingness to play organization politics has contributed to my career\nsuccess\n45 55\nIf necessary to achieve organizational goals, I am prepared to hurt others\nwith political tactics\n31 14\nIf necessary to achieve personal goals, I am prepared to hurt others with\npolitical tactics\n31 11\nI know that I have hurt others with my use of political tactics 26 14\nOne explanation is that ruthlessness is equated more with impersonal management actions (closing facilities,\ncutting budgets, declaring redundancies), while hurting another individual is personal, and is more\ndifficult to do \u2013 or to admit to doing.\nHow do senior management actions influence political behaviour? It appears that senior management are\nbelieved to be more involved in political behaviour, with 87% agreeing that \u2018the higher you go in the\norganization, the more political the climate becomes\u2019. Senior managers appear also to be regarded as role\nmodels, with 84% agreeing that \u2018when the top team play politics, other managers follow their example\u2019.\nThere were no job level differences in responses to those items. However, while 23% agreed that \u2018senior\nmanagement could stop the politics if they wanted to\u2019, senior managers appeared less confident than\nmiddle managers of their ability to do so, with 72% of senior managers compared with 45% of middle\nmanagers expressing disagreement.\nDoes the incidence of political behaviour vary? Only 21% indicated that \u2018the level of organization politics is\nconstant\u2019, and 77% agreed that \u2018the degree of political behaviour varies over time\u2019. Does\norganizational change intensify political activity? Only 20% agreed that \u2018you only see high levels of\npolitics during periods of organizational change\u2019. There were no sectoral differences in response to those\nitems. Respondents were asked to indicate whether \u2018there is more organization politics today than five years\nago\u2019; 49% agreed. However, more public sector respondents (52%) agreed that there were \u2018more politics\u2019\nthan private sector managers (43%). These findings are inconclusive, contradicting the thesis of Kumar and\nThibodeaux (1990) and indicating that further investigation of factors influencing political intensity\nmight be a fruitful topic for further investigation.\nOrganizational effectiveness and change\nDo managers regard politics as a useful tool, or as an impediment, with respect to implementing change and\nimproving organizational effectiveness? The findings indicate that the answer is contingent on the way\nin which tactics are deployed. On the one hand, 85% agreed (26% strongly) that \u2018I have seen\norganization politics damage organizational effectiveness\u2019. But more than half of respondents (53%) had\nexperienced politics contributing to organizational effectiveness.\nThe significance of political behaviour in change appears to be widely acknowledged:\n\uf0b7 60% agreed that \u2018politics become more important as organizational change becomes more complex\u2019;\n\uf0b7 79% agreed that \u2018politics can be used to\ninitiate and drive useful change initiatives\u2019;\n\uf0b7 81 % agreed that \u2018political tactics can be effective in dealing with resistance to change\u2019;\n\uf0b7 85% agreed that \u2018major changes need to be \u201csteered\u201d through the organization politics\u2019; and\n\uf0b7 93% agreed (21% strongly) that \u2018politics can be used to slow down and block useful change initiatives\u2019.\nOnly 24% felt (4% strongly) that \u2018major changes must be free from organization politics if they are to be\neffective\u2019. In addition, only 9% agreed with the item \u2018change agents who avoid organization politics are more\nlikely to succeed in their roles\u2019. As other studies have suggested (Buchanan, 2003; Ferris et al., 2000), the\neffectiveness of organizational change is dependent, at least in part, on the political skill of change drivers,\nagents, catalysts or leaders.\nPerformance, reputation, career\nThe view that political skill is central to personal reputation and career, as well as to aspects of management\nperformance, also seems to be widely recognized. The findings suggest that managers who ignore\norganization politics may damage their reputations, their careers and also the sections for which they are\nresponsible. As noted earlier, over 90% agreed (19% strongly) with the item \u2018most managers, if they want\nto succeed, have to play politics at least part of the time\u2019. This is broadly consistent with the 72%\ndisagreement with the item \u2018it is not possible to do a good job and play politics at the same time\u2019:\n\uf0b7 90% agreed that \u2018managers who play organization politics well can improve their career prospects\u2019;\n\uf0b7 81 % agreed that \u2018personal reputations can be enhanced by appropriate political game playing\u2019;\n\uf0b7 75% agreed that \u2018the departments of skilled organization politicians attract higher levels of resource\u2019; and\n\uf0b7 60% agreed that \u2018managers who are not prepared to play politics see their careers suffer\u2019.\nThere were no gender differences in responses to those four items. Responses to three other items indicate the\npotential risks in avoiding organization politics:\n\uf0b7 83% agreed that \u2018departments in my organization use politics to try and win the competition for resources\u2019;\n\uf0b7 71% agreed that \u2018managers who don\u2019t play politics are pushed aside by those who do\u2019; and\n\uf0b7 71 % agreed that \u2018the departments of managers who are politically unskilled suffer in resource terms\u2019.\nThere would appear to be a widespread perception that managers unable or unwilling to engage in\norganization politics jeopardize the resourcing of the sections for which they are responsible, as well as their\ncareers.\nGender differences\nOnly 13% agreed that \u2018women are better at playing politics than men\u2019; the modal response (47%)\nwas \u2018unsure\u2019. A higher proportion of women (52%) than men (41%) disagreed with this item. Also, 27%\nagreed that \u2018men play more political games than women\u2019; the modal response (41%) was again \u2018unsure\u2019.\nHowever, more women (31%) agreed that men play more political games than men do (18%). These\nresults are inconclusive. One possibility is that there are no gender differences; the motives, organizational\ninfrastructures and access to resources are equivalent for all players in the politics game. Another\nexplanation is that the differences are too subtle and complex for a survey questionnaire to capture. Other\nresponses indicate that, while women are as willing as men to engage in politics, women express more\nconcern for potential interpersonal harm. While Kanter (1979) and Mann (1995) argue that women are\ndisadvantaged in the acquisition of organizational power, Arroba and James (1988) argue that women need to\nbe politically aware and \u2018wise\u2019, exploiting innate advantages such as intuition, sensitivity, observation and\na willingness to engage with feelings. Recent anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that many women\nreject management roles because of their distaste for political behaviour (Arkin, 2004).\nWhen necessity commands: actor-theory-in-use\nMy view is that organizational politics are almost inevitable, but they can be constructive or destruc-\ntive. The best management skills would seek to ensure that constructive uses, such as attraction of\nresources, or changed working practices, are delivered through using supportive political skills\n(especially with external partners). The worst skills are tantamount to bullying and dishonesty which\nshould not be condoned. (Middle manager, public sector hospital, female, age 30\u201339)\nTable 4 summarizes the findings from this study, following the format of the \u2018antecedents\u2013behaviours\u2013\nconsequences\u2019 framework in Table 1. It is important to repeat that, unlike the model developed by\nKacmar and Ferris (1991) and Ferris et al. (2002a), designed to be subject to objective empirical test, the\nframework in Table 4 illustrates the subjective understanding of respondents concerning the triggers,\nbehaviours and outcomes of organization politics. In other words, Table 4 codifies the actor-theory-in-use\nthat managers appear to use with respect to organization politics.\nThis evidence confirms that the use of political tactics is perceived to be widespread, generating both beneficial\nand dysfunctional individual and organizational outcomes (Drory, 1993; Ferris and Kacmar, 1992; Gandz\nand Murray, 1980). While this study was not designed to test theory linking the triggers, substance and\noutcomes of political behaviour, it is instructive to consider the findings under those headings, with\nregard to antecedents, consequences and further research.\nTable 4.

Political behaviour seems to be widely\nperceived as a \u2018necessary evil\u2019, but ethical considerations appear to present no barrier to the deployment of\nsuch tactics for most respondents. While most agreed that they were prepared to play politics to achieve\nobjectives, around two-thirds (but a higher proportion of women than men) indicated that, although it was\nimportant to understand this aspect of organizational behaviour, they would prefer to avoid it. Most\nwould like their organizations to be less political. Over two-thirds claimed that political tactics had caused\nthem injury, and most indicated that they gained no satisfaction from winning a political exchange. Women\nappear to engage in political tactics as readily as men, but seem less prepared to hurt others; a higher\nproportion of men admitted to injuring others through political tactics. Given the pervasive nature of\norganization politics, and the range of precipitating conditions, calls to depoliticize management behaviour\n(Klein, 1988; Stone, 1997) imply an agenda which even senior managers would find challenging.\nThis evidence suggests that previous studies may have underestimated the readiness of managers to\novercome their ambivalence, and \u2018to enter into evil when necessity commands\u2019 (Machiavelli, 1961, ch.\nxviii). The consistently high degrees of willingness to engage in politics, to act ruthlessly, and to reciprocate\nin kind when dealing with others who use political tactics imply an attitude of \u2018you stab my back, I\u2019ll stab\nyours\u2019. Indeed, that ambivalence may be significantly diluted by the perception that organization\npolitics is necessary, ethical and fun.\nBehaviours\nPrevious studies have focused only on common political tactics. The evidence from this study confirms the\nrichness of the behaviour repertoire in this respect, while indicating the perceived prevalence of different\ntactics. Five tactics were perceived to be more common: building networks, using \u2018key players\u2019,\nbefriending power brokers, bending rules, and self-promotion. Three tactics were seen as rare (but\nnot unknown): using misinformation to confuse, spreading rumours to undermine, and keeping \u2018dirt\nfiles\u2019 to blackmail others. Considering those common and rare tactics, interpersonal manipulation and\nimpression management may be perceived as socially more acceptable and less hurtful than behaviours\nwhich involve dishonesty and coercion.\nConsequences\nAgain confirming previous studies, organization politics is perceived to generate a combination of\nfunctional and dysfunctional individual and organizational outcomes. The impact of politics on change and\norganizational effectiveness appears to be widely recognized, blocking or driving initiatives, of value in\nhandling resistance to change, and disrupting or contributing to effectiveness (itself an ambivalent and\npolitically charged concept). Most managers thus believe that change agents must be politically skilled.\nExtending the findings of Gandz and Murray (1980), most managers attribute success in reputation,\ncareer and resourcing, at least in part, to the exercise of political skill. Graham\u2019s (1996) attempt to\nestablish a link between political skill and career may have foundered on the narrow measures used to\noperationalize skill (\u2018Mach IV\u2019 scores) and success (salary). In-depth qualitative studies of behaviours and\noutcomes may reveal other links and outcomes.\nTheoretical implications\nThe evidence suggests that the political theory of organization held by most managers incorporates the\nfollowing propositions. First, political behaviour may be precipitated by a combination of individual and\ncontextual factors, and is not necessarily perceived to be self-serving. Second, the behaviour repertoire\nof the organization politician is diverse, and while \u2018social\u2019 tactics may be perceived as more acceptable\nthan covert manipulation, most managers see no ethical impediments to the use of political tactics. Third,\npolitical behaviour is not necessarily seen as damaging, but is perceived to generate both functional\nand dysfunctional individual and organizational consequences. While perhaps capturing the essence of\ncurrent understanding in this field, these broad propositions leave several significant questions unanswered.\nThis study has considerable limitations. The survey approach has a number of advantages but still\nrepresents a methodological compromise. Survey methods struggle to capture the dynamics of political\ngames unfolding through a series of overt and covert manipulations and influence attempts, involving\nshifting combinations of individuals and coalitions (Bacharach and Lawler, 1998). A questionnaire\ncannot explore in depth the temporal and contextual dimensions of those processes. Survey methods can\nonly sketch the outlines, revealing broad patterns and trends, and indicate issues for further study, with\ndifferent samples, deploying other research methods. The sample is purposive and nonrandom,\ndisplaying a bias towards the public sector and to well-qualified managers with experience of\norganizational change; statistical generalizations to a wider population cannot be confident.\nNevertheless, it is reasonable to consider the transferability (Lincoln and Guba, 1985) of the findings from\nthis study to the wider management population. Confidence in that transfer is strengthened by the\nconsistency of the response patterns, and by the extent to which the results of previous studies (rooted in a\ncontrasting epistemology) are broadly supported. Confirmation of the findings from previous research\nsuggests a degree of shared experience across different cultural and organizational settings. It is also\nreasonable to invite management readers to compare the resultant codified theory-in-use with their own\nperceptions and experiences (Stake, 1994, describes this process of reflection as naturalistic\ngeneralization). It is perhaps also reasonable to speculate with regard to the practical implications\nthat arise should that actor-theory-in-use indeed be widely held by other managers.\nA number of further lines of enquiry are thus indicated. As this topic has been studied mainly from a\npositivist perspective, the discursive processes through which behaviours come to be labelled as\npolitical, attributed with political intent, and socially constructed as political remain unexplored. The\nnature and significance of gender differences in this domain are not well understood, either by researchers or, it\nseems, by managers. While political behaviour is perceived to vary in intensity, little is known about the\ntriggering and dampening mechanisms that are perceived to cause variation. Political skill is perceived to\nbe central to the role of change agent, and while Ferris, Buckley and Allen (1992) advocate a \u2018balance\u2019\nbetween \u2018pure politician\u2019 and \u2018demonstrated ability\u2019, little is known about the development of that\nbalance, presumably acquired as an individual\u2019s moral standards and ideals are tested and compromised by\norganizational realities (Jackall, 1988; Provis, 2004). Mainiero\u2019s (1994) study of female American\nsenior managers is an exception in this regard. While reputation and career success are attributed to\npolitical skill, the conditions and processes through which political behaviours affect reputation are\nunclear. There appear to be no cross-cultural comparisons of management experience and perceptions of\norganization politics. Critically, little is understood concerning the combinations of circumstances in\nwhich the functional consequences of political behaviour, individual and organizational, are produced.\nWhile large-n quantitative research may be appropriate in some settings, the more subtle aspects of the\nnature, processes and implications of organization political behaviour may be more effectively revealed\nusing innovative small-n qualitative methods.\nConcern with value-driven ethical leadership appears to have done little to reduce either the perceived\nincidence or significance of political behaviour. Assuming that these findings may indeed apply to the\nwider management population, what implications for practice emerge? Management selection,\nparticularly for change- related roles, should consider candidates\u2019 political as well as professional\ncompetencies. Understanding organization politics without personal involvement may not be a good option for\nmanagers in general, or for change agents in particular, concerned with reputation and career. Those\nfollowing Zaleznik (1997), focusing on \u2018real work\u2019, avoiding \u2018psychopolitics\u2019, may jeopardize the flow of\nresources to their sections, damage their reputations for \u2018getting things done\u2019 and limit their promotion\nprospects. Business schools and others engaged in management development may identify\nopportunity in the finding that, despite the significance of this component of management and change\nagency roles, almost 80% of respondents said they had no training in dealing with organization politics.\nReferences\nAllen, R.
