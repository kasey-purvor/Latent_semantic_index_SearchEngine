Schematic SA transfer function.\npresence of large carrier populations resulting from intense\noptical excitation [1].\nWhen incorporated in a return-to-zero (RZ) transmission\nsystem, SAs can prevent the accumulation of noise on the\nzeros, since zeros will experience higher attenuation than the\nrelatively high power signal pulses [2], [3]. Since MQW SAs\nare passive, they have the potential to provide a simple solution\nto transmission impairments arising from low-level radiation\nbetween pulses.\nThe use of MQW SAs as regenerators in a 10 Gb\/s dispersion\nshifted fiber (DSF) soliton system was proposed in [2] and\nwas extended though numerical simulations to a wavelength\ndivision multiplexing (WDM) soliton system, again using DSF,\nin [4]. The performance improvement was attributed to the\nprevention of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) accumu-\nlation on the zeros and the attenuation of low-intensity pulse\nwings (resulting from the soliton-soliton interaction) by the\nMQW SAs. The regeneration capability of MQW SAs was first\ndemonstrated in a 10 Gb\/s quasi-linear transmission system in\nwhich fiber dispersion was exactly compensated, in [5]. The\nSAs increased the error-free transmission distance in a 10 Gb\/s\nsystem by a factor of 2.5 when the amplifier noise level was\nincreased.\nHowever, saturation of practical MQW SAs requires the\nincident optical pulses to have high energy. A saturation energy,\ndefined as the energy resulting in a 50% absorption reduc-\ntion in the MQW material, of 12 pJ has been measured in\nInGaAs\/InAlAs and InGaAsP\/InGaAsP MQW SAs that have\nbeen ion implanted for picosecond recovery [6], [7]. When\noperating at 10 Gb\/s, or at higher repetition rates, the average\noutput power available from practical erbium-doped fiber am-\nplifiers (EDFAs) will restrict the pulse energies incident on the\nMQW SAs such that complete saturation is not possible.\n0733-8724\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In-\ncomplete MQW SA saturation will result in signal pulses of\ndifferent energies experiencing differing levels of attenuation,\nwith the attenuation being lower for higher energy pulses.\nConsequently, the variance in pulse energy will be increased\nafter passing through the SA. A system in which the signal\npasses through cascaded MQW SAs may therefore exhibit\neventual destabilization of the pulse train, that is, dramatically\nincreased noise on ones.\nEffective pulse stabilization can be achieved in quasi-linear\nsystems if the signal pulses propagate for some short distance\nunder conditions such that they approximate solitons and are\nthen passed through a narrow bandwidth optical filter [8].\nPulses are transformed into solitons in a DSF. Higher energy\nsolitons experience a greater degree of spectral broadening due\nto self phase modulation (SPM) as they propagate in the DSF\nand hence lose more energy in the filter. This technique is\nreferred to as soliton filtering in the rest of this paper. Suitable\nsystem parameters will lead to normalization of the energy of\nthe propagating solitons [9]. In its first practical demonstration,\nsoliton filtering was used in conjunction with synchronous\namplitude modulation in a two-channel 40 Gb\/s\/channel WDM\nsystem [10]. The soliton filtering technique has not been used in\nisolation in experimental systems; either MQW SAs [11], [12]\nor synchronous modulation [13], [14] has been used to prevent\nthe accumulation of ASE on the zeroes.\nThe use of MQW SAs in conjunction with soliton filtering\nto improve transmission performance in commercially impor-\ntant standard single-mode fiber (SMF)-based system was first\nreported in [15]. The configuration, which is discussed in more\ndetail in Section II, used long (80 km) unamplified spans of\nSMF between regenerators. Exact dispersion compensation was\nimplemented such that the system operated in the quasi-linear\nregime. The greater than three times increase of error-free trans-\nmission distance observed in the experiments demonstrated that\nMQW SAs and soliton filtering can improve the performance\nof nonoptimal systems, which are more representative of those\nencountered in practical situations. A similar device was used\nin an earlier demonstration of noise suppression at 40 Gb\/s [16].\nAlthough techniques have been employed in some of the\nwork reviewed above that have the effect of countering destabi-\nlization by the SA, the phenomenon has received little explicit\ninvestigation so far. In this paper, we explore in more detail the\nsignal destabilization due to MQW SAs, and the use of soliton\nfiltering to counter it. We present a computer model for MQW\nSAs based on the asymmetric Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot (AFP) cavity struc-\nture and demonstrate its use by simulating previously reported\nresults for a 10 Gb\/s recirculating loop transmission experi-\nment using MQW SAs and soliton filtering for signal regen-\neration [12]. This arrangement results in significant increases\nin error-free transmission distance (defined as the distance to\nwhich the signal propagated before the Q-factor fell below 6),\nfrom 2000 km to more than 7000 km in the 10 Gb\/s system\nconsidered, which employed regeneration after every 80-km\nspan of SMF.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In\nSection II, the experimental transmission system and the MQW\nFig. 2. Ten-gigabit per second recirculating loop configuration.\nSA devices used are described. A numerical model of the MQW\nSAs is developed in Section III, enabling simulation of their use\nfor regeneration in fiber transmission systems. In Section IV,\nthis model is then used to simulate the 10 Gb\/s transmission\nsystem and to investigate the signal destabilization by the SAs\nand its control by temporary soliton propagation. The main\nresults of the work are discussed in Section V.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL 10-Gb\/s SYSTEM\nThe systems modeling described in this paper initially fo-\ncuses on a single-channel 10 Gb\/s recirculating loop experiment\nusing a reflective MQW SA [12]. The recirculating loop con-\nfiguration used in the experiments is shown in Fig. 2. The loop\ncontains an 80 km SMF span with a dispersion of 17 ps\/nm\/km.\nThis is compensated for using a length of dispersion compen-\nsating fiber (DCF). The dispersion compensator was trimmed\nto provide exact dispersion compensation such that signal\npropagation was in the quasi-linear regime. The loop also\ncontains a 3 km length of DSF through which the signal pulses\npropagate as solitons, prior to narrowband optical filtering\nfor stabilization. The dispersion of the DSF at the operating\nwavelength is approximately 4 ps\/nm\/km. This soliton filtering\nmechanism, accomplished by the DSF and the filter, along with\nthe SA, forms the regenerator. The full-width at half-maximum\n(FWHM) length of the launched pulses is 6 ps. When making\nmeasurements without the regeneration components, an addi-\ntional optical filter, with a bandwidth of 3 nm, is inserted in\nthe loop, at the point indicated in Fig. 2. The receiver used\nin the experiment incorporated a 40 Gb\/s to 10 Gb\/s optical\ndemultiplexer.\nThe structure of the SAs used in the transmission experi-\nment is illustrated schematically in Fig. 3. The MQW region\nconsisted of 50 9.5-nm-thick InGaAsP wells and 51 7.5-nm-\nthick InGaAsP barriers with band edges at 1.6 and 1.1 \u00b5m,\nrespectively. The Bragg stack had 16 periods, each comprising a\nquarter wave layer of InP, and a quarter wave layer of InGaAsP\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Schematic of MQW SA device.\nFig. 4. Simulation results showing the vacancy density per ion resulting from\nthe implantation of the device of Fig. 3 with 4 MeV nitrogen ions.\nwith a band edge at 1.4 \u00b5m. Both the MQW region and the\nBragg stack were grown in a single metal organic vapor phase\nepitaxy (MOVPE) step [17]. All the materials were lattice\nmatched to the InP substrate to avoid strain.\nThe Bragg stack and the front air semiconductor interface\nform an AFP cavity that is resonant at the operating wavelength.\nUnder small signal conditions, the absorption of the MQW\nregion is such that destructive interference between reflections\nfrom the AFP cavity results in a small aggregate reflectivity.\nOptical excitation leads to a reduction of the MQW absorption\nsuch that effective destructive interference no longer occurs and\nthe aggregate reflectivity is significantly increased.\nSince the absorption changes in the MQW region are a\nconsequence of the EAB optical nonlinearity [1], their speed\nis dependent on photocarrier lifetime, which is typically sev-\neral nanoseconds in high quality epitaxially grown MQW\nstructures. Picosecond carrier lifetimes, which are required\nfor 10 Gb\/s systems, can be achieved in MQW materials con-\ntaining a suitable population of lattice defects. Mid-gap levels\nresulting from the presence of defects will accelerate carrier\nrecombination.\nTo achieve high-speed EAB, nitrogen ions with an energy of\n4 MeV were implanted through the top of the device [18]. The\nvacancy distribution resulting from such ion implantation, as\ndetermined using the simulation program SRIM-2000 [19], is\nshown in Fig. 4. The ions propagate through the MQW region,\ncreating the required defect population, and are deposited deep\nwithin the Bragg stack.\nImplantation was performed at an elevated temperature of\n200 \u25e6C. This was sufficient to induce dynamic annealing in\nFig. 5. Dependence of the reflectivity of the MQW SA on pulse energy in\nmeasurements conducted using 2 ps duration pulses.\nFig. 6.

This approach uses the concept of screening\narea to represent the reduction of absorption in the MQW due\nto the presence of the exciton and free photocarrier populations.\nDue to the relatively short lifetimes of excitons, screening\ndue to the exciton population need only be considered in the\ncase of sub-picosecond optical excitations [1]. The transmis-\nsion system modeling described in this paper therefore uses a\nsimplified rate equation model that ignores exciton screening.\nThe photocarrier population in each of the quantum wells\n(QWs) within the device is modeled separately.

Populations are modeled using the\nrate equation\ndx\ndt\n=\n(1\u2212 x)\n\u03c4PS\nP \u2212 x\n\u03c4\n(1)\nwhere x is the normalized photocarrier population, P is the\nincident optical power, PS is the saturation power, and \u03c4 is\nthe time constant for the exponential recovery time of the\nphotocarrier population. The normalization of x is such that\nx = 1 when the QW is fully saturated. PS is defined as the\npower of unmodulated light that will result in a factor-of-two\nreduction of the QW absorption. Equation (1) is written in\nterms of power and saturation power, rather than intensity and\nsaturation intensity as in the case of [20] for compatibility\nwith the transmission system model. Given the value of x in a\nwell, the absorption in that well is \u03b1 = \u03b10(1\u2212 x), where \u03b10\nis the small signal absorption. The decay term x\/\u03c4 assumes\nexponential decay of the photocarrier population.\nHaving calculated the well absorptions, the magnitude and\nphase of the reflectivity of the AFP cavity are determined using\nscattering matrices [21]. The field due to the standing wave, and\nhence its power, can be calculated in each well by summing\nfield contributions due to the incident wave as it is reflected\nback and forth within the cavity.\nFor systems modeling, the response of the SA to a signal,\nrepresented as a series of points in the time domain, must be\ndetermined. To achieve this, the following steps are performed\nfor each point in the representation of the incident signal: the\nabsorption in each QW is determined from the corresponding\nvalue of the photocarrier population x; the power of the stand-\ning wave in each well is calculated; the value of x in each well\nis updated using the corresponding value of dx\/dt from (1);\nand the overall reflectivity of the SA is calculated.\nThis MQW\u2013AFP SA model was incorporated into a com-\nputer program that was used to simulate periodically amplified\ntransmission systems. The split-step Fourier method [22] was\nused to describe signal propagation in optical fiber. A pseudo-\nrandom bit sequence of 256 bits was used. The MQW SA\nparameters used in the modeling are summarized in Table I.\nThese were set such that the results of the device model were\nconsistent with the characterization results shown in Section III.\nIV. SIMULATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL\n10 Gb\/s SYSTEM\nInitial simulations of the 10 Gb\/s system were done to verify\nthat the results were consistent with those obtained experimen-\ntally. Fig. 7 compares simulated and experimentally measured\nQ-factor evolution without regeneration and with regeneration.\nThere is a satisfactory agreement between results obtained from\nexperiment and from modeling.\nEye diagrams of the optical signal in the simulation without\nregeneration after propagating once, and 25 times, around\nthe recirculating loop are shown in Fig. 8. After 2000 km,\nthe pulses are broadened, while noise is added on zeros and\nones. Pulse broadening is not evident in the corresponding\neye diagrams for the simulation with regeneration, shown in\nFig. 9. The noise on zeros appears to have been reduced with\nregeneration, while it is not possible to conclude a trend on the\nnoise on ones.\nThe pulse width evolution in the system with and without\nregeneration is shown in Fig. 10. The pulse width in the unre-\ngenerated system increases steadily from 6 ps at launch to more\nthan 14 ps after propagating for 2000 km. The pulse width in\nthe regenerated system is generally preserved, increasing only\nto about 6.5 ps as it reaches 7000 km. The relatively stable pulse\nwidth in the regenerated system is dependent on the parameters\nfor temporary soliton propagation in DSF, the launch power,\ngroup velocity dispersion (GVD), and the bandwidth of the\nfilter following the DSF.\nTo investigate the effect of MQW SAs and soliton filtering\nin the system individually, the Q-factor evolution is plotted in\nFig. 11. In the simulations using only SAs, there is no filter\nincorporated after the MQW SA. While some improvement of\nperformance is seen in the system using only soliton filtering,\nthere is a dramatic degradation in the system using only MQW\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

However, when the two components are combined, the\nerror-free transmission distance is increased by a factor of 1.9\ncompared to soliton filtering alone.\nFig. 12 shows the evolution of a part of the pulse train in the\nsimulation with MQW SAs only in the system. A significantly\ngreater variation of the levels of ones is observed as the signal\npasses multiple times through the loop. Small energy variations\nacquired by the propagating signal pulses, due to noise, or\nto intrachannel cross phase modulation [23], are amplified\nafter transmission through the MQW SA. The eye diagrams\nof Fig. 13 compare the signals in the simulation using MQW\nSAs for regeneration, and in that with no regeneration, after\n15 trips round the loop. It is shown that the variation of the\nlevels of the ones, which occurs when MQW SAs are used, is\nnot as significant in the eye diagrams without regeneration.\nFig. 14(a) shows the error-free transmission distance\nachieved in the system with soliton filtering only. For these\nsimulations the DSF parameters were kept the same, while the\nfilter bandwidth and the power into the fiber were varied. It was\nfound that the spectral filtering used in the 3 km span of DSF\nwas not far from optimum in the 10 Gb\/s experiment of [12],\nwhere the power into the fiber was 10.5 dBm. The pulse-width\nevolution for a few filter bandwidths at this power is plotted in\nFig. 14(b). Temporary soliton propagation in the 3 km length of\nDSF and optical filtering with a bandwidth of 0.9 nm controls\nthe pulse width and limits pulse broadening significantly in this\ndispersion compensated system.\nA better understanding of the system using soliton filtering\nonly, and both soliton filtering and MQW SAs can be gained\nby referring to Fig. 15, which shows a representation of the\nevolution of a short section of the signal as it propagates\n50 times around the loop. Results without regeneration, and\nusing MQW SAs as well as soliton filtering, are shown for\ncomparison. Preservation of the input pulse width occurs in\nthe result with soliton filtering; however, there is also noise\naccumulation in the intervals between the signal pulses, which\ngradually degrades the system performance. MQW SAs remove\nthis noise, resulting in stable pulse transmission in the case of\nfull regeneration.\nIn order to isolate the effect of each component on zeros\nand ones, the partial Q-factors Q1 on ones and Q0 on zeros\nare plotted on Fig. 16. Q1 and Q0 are calculated after each\ntransmission through the loop as described in [24], that is\nQ1 =\n\u00b51 \u2212D\n\u03c31\nand Q0 =\nD \u2212 \u00b50\n\u03c30\n(2)\nwhere \u00b51,0 and \u03c31,0 are the mean and the standard deviation of\nones and zeros, respectively, and D is the decision voltage.\nFig. 16 shows that when used alone, MQW SAs add noise on\nones while they suppress the noise on zeros. The destabilization\nof the ones occurs very rapidly, with significant impact after\nonly a few passes through the SA (Fig. 12), while the noise on\nthe zeros only becomes significant after a much larger number\nof recirculations around the loop, so there is a reduction of\nthe overall Q-factor compared to the case without regeneration\n(Fig. 11). However, when combined with some mechanism of\npulse stabilization, such as soliton filtering, the adverse effect of Fig. 15.

Q1 and Q0 plotted versus transmission distance.\nMQW SAs is cancelled and the overall transmission is further\nimproved due to noise suppression on ones by the SAs.\nThe results presented in this section are consistent with the\nassertion that, in a system in which MQW SAs are to be used\nto prevent noise accumulation on the zeros, some mechanism,\nsuch as soliton filtering, is required to stabilize the signal pulses.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA detailed MQW SA model for AFP cavity devices has been\ndeveloped, allowing the power of the standing wave in the AFP\ncavity and the dynamics of recovery from saturation in the\nMQW to be included in simulations of transmission systems.\nThis model was used in a number of simulation exercises.\nThese focused on the recirculating loop configuration used in\na 10 Gb\/s transmission experiment. In this experiment, MQW\nSAs and soliton filtering were shown to significantly extend the\nerror-free distance in a quasi-linear system with 80 km SMF\nspans between regenerators.\nThe model was used to investigate the relative contributions\nof the different elements of the regeneration process. The\nbehavior of the system was studied when regeneration was\nperformed using MQW SAs or soliton filtering separately, and\nwhen they were combined.\nWhen used in isolation, MQW SAs prevented noise accu-\nmulation in the intervals between signal pulses. However, the\nrapid destabilization of signal pulses in the system studied led\nto an overall degradation of the system performance. The error-\nfree transmission distance (defined as the distance to which the\nsignal propagated in the simulated system before the Q-factor\nfell below 6) was reduced from 2240 km in the absence of\nregeneration to 1440 km with MQW SAs only, due to noise\naccumulation on the ones.\nWith soliton filtering alone, the error-free transmission dis-\ntance was 3920 km: an increase by a factor of 1.75 over the\ndistance without regeneration. This was due to a reduction\nin the noise on the ones. Soliton filtering was also shown to\nstabilize the pulse width.\nWhen MQW SAs and soliton filtering were combined, noise\nlevels on both ones and zeros were significantly reduced com-\npared to those without regeneration, resulting in an error-free\ntransmission distance of \u223c 7500 km: an increase by a factor\nof 3.3 over the distance without regeneration. Thus, when used\nin concert with a technique that stabilizes the pulse amplitude\n(ones), MQW SAs are shown to be a highly effective method\nfor regeneration.\nThe soliton filtering technique investigated here for pulse\nstabilization requires an additional amplification stage, and the\nlength of DSF required significantly increases the physical\nsize of the regenerator. Future research could thus be usefully\ndirected toward the development of alternative compact devices\nwith limiting behavior suitable for pulse stabilization, and SAs\nwith reduced saturation power.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
