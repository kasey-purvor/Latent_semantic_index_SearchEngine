Volume 1, the text, sets out the history of the complex before the nineteenth\ncentury and the methodologies of  the late nineteenth-century restoration project,\nbefore going on to compare the Eufrasiana with its contemporary ecclesiastical sites\nacross the Adriatic in Ravenna. Following this are chapters focussing on the artistry\nof the sixth-century mosaics and the iconographic and iconologic content of the\nimages. Volume 2 presents high-quality images of the mosaics together with plans and\naerial photographs which allow the reader an exceptional familiarity with, and\nunderstanding of, the site.\nT. and M. introduce the subject with a comprehensive historiography of the\nEufrasiana up to the nineteenth century and outline the problems faced by early\nscholars in examining the mosaics from \u00b7oor level, in poor lighting and before any\ncleaning had taken place. This is followed by a discussion of the philosophy\nand methodologies underpinning the various phases of restoration in the church and\ntheir respective successes and failures. This chapter is thought-provoking, raising\nquestions about the preservation of original artwork versus a continuation of the life\nof the monument and ownership of the contemporary viewer. Changes to the\nbuilding, its furnishing and decoration from the mid eighteenth century are discussed\nhere; however the nineteenth-century Italian master Bornia\u2019s restoration of the\nmosaic, as the most successful and most recent, is considered in greatest detail. The\nauthors have painstakingly compared the wealth of literature documenting the late\nnineteenth-century restoration with the physical reality of the changes, revealing\nsome of Bornia\u2019s ad hoc changes of plan in the name of art. The attention to detail in\nthe analysis and description of the physical properties of the tesserae and their\narrangement, supported by colour images, elucidate the subject very well; the reader is\nable to compare visually the original mosaic work with the later restoration rather\nthan taking it on faith as is often the case in reports of this nature.\nThis publication is a very good synthesis of the ethical and practical problems of\nmosaic restoration; the Eufrasiana could easily be viewed as a case study for the pros\nand cons of restoration. Discussion centres on the issue of honest restoration as\nopposed to what might be termed invisible restoration, which attempts to preserve the\noriginal appearance as a uni\u03bced whole, rather than leaving a palimpsest of changes\nthat can be read in the \u03bcnished work. T. and M. tread honestly but delicately through\nwhat remains a contentious subject.\nT. and M. then move on to consider comparanda for the Eufrasiana in an attempt\nto establish stylistic parallels, the obvious example being Ravenna. The cathedral is\ndated to the sixth century through parallels with other sixth-century ecclesiastical\ncomplexes. The authors \u03bcnd similarities between the mosaic borders and\nbackgrounds in the semi-dome of the Eufrasiana and those in the Arian Baptistery;\nthese two structures share a certain symmetry in the arrangement of the clothing in\nThe Classical Review vol. 59 no. 1 \u00a9 The Classical Association 2009; all rights reserved\n252 the classical review\ndepictions of the apostles. Further parallels are found in San Vitale between the facial\nfeatures of Maximian and those of Eufrasius and Claudius in Porec. T. and M. also\ndemonstrate that the Eufrasiana shares concepts of materiality with San Apollinaire\nin Classe and San Apollinaire Nuovo, as all three churches use mother of pearl,\napparently strategically, in their mosaics. These concepts of materiality are picked up\nin Chapter 4 as the mosaic artistry of the sixth century at Porec is considered; the\nhierarchical use of materials is discussed, from precious opalescent glass tesserae\ndepicting the face of Eufrasius in the donor portrait, to the limestone cubes adorning\nthe more peripheral parts of the images. This chapter deals speci\u03bccally with the\nlogistics of installing the mosaic programme at Porec, but could easily represent\nsixth-century mosaic art more generally; it considers all aspects of the process from\ndesign through drawings, paintings and setting teams to the consideration of the\ninteraction between light, colour and texture in the mosaic that o\u00b6ers another\nde\u03bcnition of dynamism in the Dynamic Splendour. Through a combination of\nconsultation of the historical documents relating to the restoration, close\nexamination of the setting beds and tesserae, and a consideration of the iconographic\nmeaning and parallels for these images, the authors systematically qualify the\nauthenticity of the hitherto debated aspects of the mosaic programme. The ability to\nexamine the mosaics at such close quarters has allowed T. and M. \u03bcnally to put to rest\ndoubts about which images are reconstructions and which preserve their original\nappearance and iconography.\nAn interpretation of the images follows, this time considered in terms of their\niconology. Here the content of the mosaics is discussed and parallels are drawn with\ncontemporary art in major centres such as Thessalonike and Rome. This discussion\nraises interesting questions about the manufacture and supply of materials at\nParentium and indeed the distribution of these materials within the cathedral,\nparticularly in terms of the hierarchical use of materials considered earlier in the text.\nIt is argued that a tripartite programme can be identi\u03bced in the complex messages\ncontained within the images, seeing aspects of doctrine, politics and private petition\nforming individual parts of a harmonious whole. The discussion of the iconology\nlocates the Eufrasiana \u03bcrmly in the sixth century, framing it in the context of the\nreligious and socio-political climate of the time. The two volumes provide a rigorous\nand detailed yet accessible discussion of the Eufrasiana; two appendices complement\nthe text with a comprehensive account of the early restorations and the\ntwentieth-century interventions. These volumes will be invaluable to researchers and\nstudents alike.\nDurham University CLAIRE NESBITT\nclaire.nesbitt@durham.ac.uk\nVELEIA\nCriniti (N.) (ed.) \u2018Veleiates\u2019.
