Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al               \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nMeasurement of the ethanol percentage \nin water-alcohol mixtures, such as wine \nor spirits, is a key analytical parameter \nin the beverage industry. In fact, it is \nthe most frequent analysis made in \nwinery laboratories. The importance of \nthe ethanol content in a beverage it is \nnot only because it determines the \nquality and conservation of the product \nbut also because both its high \ncommercial value and the special taxes \nto which it is subjected in all countries. \nThe latter is the main reason why the \nmeasurement of alcohol degree requires \nhigh accuracy and precision. \nThe most usual methods to \ndetermine the alcohol degree in \nwineries are based on previous dis-\ntillation and measurement of the \nalcohol in the distillate using photo-\nmetry [1] or titration [2] after chemical \nderivatisation with chromium (VI), \nareometry [3] or refractometry [4]. The \nofficial methods, based on areometry or \npicnometry [5], are slow and difficult to \nautomate; the chemical method devel-\noped by Crowell and Ough [1], based \non oxidation with chromium (VI) and \nfrequently used as reference method, \nhas an acceptable accuracy and preci-\nsion but is even longer and tedious than \nthe official ones because of the \nnecessity for previous distillation. Other \nmore scarcely used methods are based \non ebullometry [6], -endowed with a \nlow precision- and on measurements of \nsurface tension which are highly \ninfluenced by the matrix of the target \nbeverage and the working conditions of \nthe analysis. Chromatographic methods \n[7],  both GC and HPLC, are also used \nfor the determination of this parameter, \nbut the higher costs of acquisition and \nmaintenance of the equipments do not \njustify the investment most times. Other \ntechnique used for this determination \nbut that present irreproducibility due to \nthe matrix of the beverage is the near \ninfrared spectroscopy [8].   \nThe aim of this work was to \ndevelop an easy to automate flow injec-\ntion (FI) method, fast, cheap and with \nenough accuracy and precision by using \nanalytical pervaporation for separation \nand a density-meter with a vibrating \ntube as detector. Pervaporation is a non \nchromatographic membrane-based se-\nparation technique which has for long \nbeen employed in the industry and that \nselectively separates a liquid mixture by \npartial vaporisation through a non-\nporous polymeric membrane. The \nseparation is not based on relative \nvolatilities, as in the case of distillation, \nbut rather on the relative rates of \npermeation through the membrane. \nAnalytical pervaporation can be defined \nas the combination of evaporation and \ngas diffusion in a single module [9,10]. \nIn the case of the vibrating tube density \ndetector an either straight or more \nusually U-shaped tube causes me-\nchanical resonant vibrations. The \nsquare of the resonance frequency is \nthen inversely proportional to the sum \nof the mass of tube and tube contents. \nAs both the tube mass and the tube \ninner volume are known values, the \nvibrating tube method allows the \ndensity of unknown fluids to be \nTalanta, 2003, Vol 59, 691-696   \n \n 3\ndetermined in a single measurement, \nafter the instrument has been calibrated \nwith two fluids, usually water and air, \nwhich give low and high tones for high \nand low density, respectively. The U-\ntube is kept oscillating continuously at \nthe characteristic frequency, which \ndepends on the density of the filled-in \nsample. The oscillation period is \nmeasured and converted into density by \nthe equation of the Mass-Spring-Model: \nF=1\/2\u03c0\u221a[c\/(M+\u03c1V)] where, f=frequen-\ncy, c=spring constant; M=mass, \n\u03c1=density; V=volume \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used, depicted in Fig.1, \nwas built using a four-channel Gilson \nMinipuls-3 peristaltic pump (Villiers le \nBel, France) fitted with a rate selector, \ntwo Rheodyne 5041 injection valves \n(Elkay, Galway, Ireland) -one of them \nused as a selecting valve- and PTFE \ntubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (An\u00e1lisis V\u00ednicos, \nTomelloso, Spain). A DMA 4500 \ndigital density meter from Anton Paar \n(Graz, Austria) for data collection and \ntreatment was also used.  \n   \n \n \nFigure 1.

Sodium hydroxide was \nadded to 200 ml of vinegar up to pH \n10-11 and then distilled and collected in \na 100 ml volumetric flask. A volume of \n20 ml of diluted sulphuric acid and 20 \nml of potassium dichromate were added \nto 10 ml of distillate and the mixture \nwas allowed to stand for 30 min. The \nexcess of potassium dichromate was \ntitrated with ammonium iron(II) \nsulphate in the presence of 1,10-\nphenanthroline. \n \nReference method for ethanol in wine  \nCalcium hydroxide and pumice stone \nwere added to 200 ml of wine and then \ndistilled and the distillate collected in a \n200 ml volumetric flask. A volume of \n198-199 ml of distillate was collected \nwhen distillation is made in a steam \ndragging apparatus and filled to 200 ml \nwith water and at the same temperature \nthat the raw wine (\u00b12\u00baC). The deter-\nmination of the alcoholic content in the \ndistillate was made using density \nmeasurements at 20\u00baC. \n \nReference method for ethanol in \nbrandy and spirits \nThe procedure is the same as in the case \nof wine but without adding calcium \nhydroxide. \n \nProposed procedure \nThe sample was introduced into the \ndynamic manifold shown in Fig. 1 by \naspiration and pumped into the donor \nchamber of the pervaporation unit. The \nethanol was pervaporated and collected \ninto distilled water used as acceptor, \nwhich remained static by keeping valve \nIV in its filling position. Meanwhile, \nthe selecting valve SV was in position \n(2). After an interval for sufficient \nenrichment of the static acceptor with \nthe pervaporated species (3 min from \nsample introduction) valve IV was \nswitched to the injection position, SV \nswitched to position (1) and the plug \nled to the density meter. When the plug \nwas in the measuring cell, SV was \nswitched to position (2) for maintaining \nstatic the plug in the detector in order to \nallow its adjustment at 20\u00baC and then \nTalanta, 2003, Vol 59, 691-696   \n \n 5\nmeasurement of the density. In the \nmeantime, cleaning and introduction of \na new sample into the dynamic is \nperformed. The density data are \nautomatically converted (including tem-\nperature compensation of the detector if \nnecessary) into alcohol concentration \nusing the built-in conversion tables.  \n \nResults and discussion \n \nOptimisation of the method \nThe variables which affect the method \nfor the determination of alcohol degree \nwere studied by either the multivariate \nor univariate approaches depending on \neither the interrelation or independence \nbetween variables. The range studied \nand the optimal values found are shown \nin Table 1. \n \n \nTable 1.

The R-squared statistic \nindicates that the model explains \n97.55% of the variability in alcohol \ncontent. The equation of the fitted \nmodel is: alcohol (% v\/v)= -15.33 + \n0.308 T \u2013 0.571 F2 + 0.013 FT \u20137.9x10-\n5 T2, where T and F are temperature and \nflow-rate, respectively. The temperature \nis a more influential parameter than the \nflow-rate, as can be observed in the \nfigure: the highest alcohol percentages \nwere obtained at low flow rates and \nhigh temperature. The temperature had \na marked influence on the efficiency of \nthe pervaporation process as its increase \npromoted a higher vapour pressure of \nthe analyte and, therefore, a higher \nmass transfer through the membrane. A \ntemperature of 85\u00baC and a flow-rate of \n2.2 ml min-1 were selected as a compro-\nmise between sensitivity and sampling \nfrequency. The reactor R (plunged in \nthe thermostatic bath TB2 in Fig.1) had \nthe function of cooling the acceptor \nstream after leaving the pervaporator \nand before reaching the density-meter \nin order to set the temperature as closer \nas possible to 20 \u00baC. A temperature of \n17\u00baC in the thermostatic bath and an R \nvalue of 1m were sufficient for this pur-\npose. The efficiency of the per-\nvaporation was favoured by stopping \nthe acceptor solution, thus achieving a \nhigher enrichment by a mass-transfer \ncloser to equilibrium. The pervapo-\nration time, during which the acceptor \nsolution remained static, was tested be-\ntween 1 and 5 min. The analytical \nsignal increased with longer intervals as \nthe efficiency of pervaporation was fa-\nvoured. A static time of 3 min was \nchosen as a compromise between \nsensitivity and sampling rate.  \n \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al               \n \n 6 \n  \n \nFigure 2.

Density values of \nwater-alcohol solutions are automati-\ncally transformed into an estimated \nalcohol content by internal conversion \ntables at 20 \u00baC. Thus, the alcohol \ndegree is obtained without a previous \ncalibration. \nThe linear range of the method was \ncalculated using target samples of \nknown concentration established by the \nreference method. \n \nAssessment of the proposed method \nThirty different samples of brandy, \nwine, whisky, vodka and vinegar were \nused in the assessment study. Each  \n \n \ndatum was the average of three determi-\nnations. The assessment study involved \nanalytical parameters such traceability \nwith a reference method, repeatability, \nreproducibility, detection and quanti-\nfication limits and sample throughput. \nA robustness study was also developed.  \n \nRepeatability (r).The F-test was \napplied in order to establish if the \ndifferences between repeatability of the \nmethods were significant. With this \naim, the Fobs= Sr2\/Sref2 was compared \nwith the F1-\u03b1 obtained from F tables for \n\u03b1=0.05 (P=95%). As can be observed \nin Table 2, Fobs<F1-\u03b1 , so there are not \nsignificant differences between the \nrepeatability of both methods.  \n \n% alcohol\n1,5\n3,0\n4,5\n6,0\n7,5\n9,0\n10,5\n12,0\nFlow-rate (ml min-1)\nTemp (\u00baC)\nA\nlc\noh\nol\n (%\n v\n\/v\n)\n0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 60\n6570\n7580\n8590\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\nA\nlc\noh\nol\n (%\n v\n\/v\n)\nTalanta, 2003, Vol 59, 691-696   \n \n 7\nTable 2.

Table 2 \nshows that the best LOD corresponds to \nthe reference method but the value \nprovided by the FI method is enough \nfor the analysis requirements as the \nlinear range includes the concentra-\ntions of ethanol in all samples. \n \nTraceability.Prior to the traceability \nstudy, adjustment of the raw data from \nthe proposed method was mandatory \ndue to the fact that, meanwhile in the \nreference method quantitative separ-\nation of ethanol is performed by \ndistillation, in the proposed method \npartition of the analyte between the \nliquid sample and the gas headspace, \nbetween this and the membrane and \nbetween the membrane and the acceptor \nsolution is established. The adjustment \nprovided the following correlation \nequation: Y= 0.334  X + 4.343, which \npresented an excellent correlation \n(r2=0.999). The traceability of the \nmethod was studied by comparing the \nresults obtained from the 30 samples \nanalysed by both the reference and \nproposed method. Figure 3 shows the \nregression of the flow injection method \non the reference method for ethanol \ndetermination. The regression equation, \nY= 1.004 X + 0.03, shows good \ncorrelation (r2= 0.994) between the data \nfrom both methods. Confidence limits \nof 95% are shown in Fig. 3 in dotted \nlines.

Critical \nvariables of the system are the flow-\nrate and temperature of the pervapo-\nration unit. These variables were \nmodified \u00b110% from their optimum \nvalues. Errors lower than 7 and 20% \nwere observed for the flow-rate and \ntemperature, respectively. \n \nConclusions \nThe method proposed here enables the \ndetermination of the alcohol degree in \nvery different kind of beverages, with \nthe characteristic advantages of the FI \nmethods and also of the two main \nconstituents of the overall approach, \nnamely the density-meter and the \npervaporation unit. Thus, the ad-\nvantages of using a density-meter based \non the oscillating U-tube technique are, \nhigher precision and extremely fast \nmeasurements (1 min measurement-1 ). \nThe advantages of using pervaporation \nfor separation are mainly the wide field \nof application to the analysis of samples \nwhere the ethanol separation from the \nmatrix is required and the capability for \nautomation in a simple, rapid and \nrobust way. Thus, pervaporation is a \nvalid alternative to manual distillation, \nsaving thus time and costs. The pro-\nposed method is easy to use, \ninexpensive, presents a good correlation \nwith the reference method commonly \nused and can be easily implemented in \na winery laboratory for monitoring \nethanol in all kind of beverages because \nof its high reproducibility and \nrepeatability over large concentration \nranges. The manifold proposed in-\ncreased the efficiency of laboratory \noperations and throughput of analyses.   \nAcknowledgements \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nBQU 2000\/ 0241).
