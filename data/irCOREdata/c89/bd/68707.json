The vortex lines them-\nselves have been well-understood almost since their orig-\ninal discovery [3, 4] half a century ago. To reach an un-\nderstanding of their collective motion in QT, however, \nrepresents a problem in complexity where major chal-\nlenges remain to be tackled. It must be emphasized that \nthe vortices are the components of QT. One can no more \nexpect to predict the properties of QT from an under-\nstanding of these components than one could e.g. predict \nsecond sound or the other superfluid properties of liquid \n4He from a detailed knowledge of the 4He atom; like-\nwise, neither could one infer the periodic table, or chem-\nistry, from a detailed knowledge of protons, neutrons and \nelectrons. In each case, there are emergent phenomena \nthat could hardly have been anticipated from an under-\nstanding of the microscopic components of the system. \nNote also that, in reality, and contrary to their appear-\nance, the arrangement of vortex lines in QT is not ran-\ndom. \nBelow its superfluid transition temperature 7 \\ , liquid \n4He of density p can be regarded [5] as a mixture two \ncomponents: a normal fluid component with viscosity, \ncarrying the whole entropy of the liquid, and an inviscid \nsuperfluid carrying no entropy, with densities pn and ps \nrespectively such that pn + ps = p . Quantum mechanics \nplaces severe restrictions on the motion of the superfluid, \nin that the circulation is quantized \ni\\s-d\u00a3 = h\/m4 (1) \nwhere vs is the fluid velocity, m\\ is the helium atomic \nmass and the integral is taken around a loop enclosing \nthe vortex core; there is no such restriction on motions in \nthe normal fluid component, which are classical. In the \ncase of 3He, the m\\ is replaced by 2m^, the mass of a \nCooper pair. \nThe relative proportions of the two fluids are such \nthat the normal fluid density pn\/p = 1 at T = 7\\ and \npn\/p = 0 at T = 0; correspondingly, the superfluid den-\nsity ps\/p = 0 at T = Tx and ps\/p = 1 at T = 0. In a \ntypical experiment, QT is created by flow or by motion \nof an object in the liquid. In what follows, we will as-\nsume conventional isothermal flow; we will not consider \nsuperfluid\/normal fluid counterflow (which, although of-\nten discussed in the literature, is actually a rather spe-\ncialised kind of flow, peculiar to superfluids). Because \nthe vortex lines are metastable states of the liquid, they \nmay be expected to decay away with time. The main aim \nof the theory is to identify the underlying decay mech-\nanisms, explore the corresponding physics, and char-\nacterise the form and timescale of the decay for com-\nparison with experiment. As we will see, the theoret-\nical situation is much clearer in the temperature range \nwhere the normal fluid density pn is appreciable, say for \n1 < 7 T < 7 \\ = 2 . 1 7 K . The main unsolved questions re-\nlate to the T \u2014\u2022 0 limit, by which we mean the tempera-\nture range in which pn ~ 0 so that the effect of viscous \ndissipation is negligible. \nCP850, Low Temperature Physics: 24th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics; \nedited by Y.

In particular, we describe the emergent \ntheoretical picture describing QT in the T \u2014\u2022 0 limit, \nconsider some of the experiments carried out to date in \nthis temperature range, and discuss the requirements of \nthe new generation of experiments now needed to test \nthe theory. Our emphasis will be on experiments, but first \nwe consider the theoretical background in order to set the \ncontext of the work. \nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND \nClassical turbulence \nIn order to appreciate the problems presented by QT, \nit is first necessary to understand the accepted picture of \nclassical turbulence (CT) [6, 7] and the manner in which \nit decays. The flow of the fluid is governed by the Navier-\nStokes equation [8] \ndv \ndt + (v. V) v = Vp + vV\n2v (2) \nwhere v is the flow velocity, p is the pressure, p is the \ndensity, and V is the kinematic viscosity. The ratio of \nthe nonlinear inertial term (v.V)v to the dissipative term \nvV2v gives the Reynolds number Re = lu\/v. Here, u \nand \u00a3 are respectively a characteristic velocity and length \ndescribing the flow. In turbulent flows, Re is large and so \nthe effect of dissipation can be ignored. \nIn typical flows, energy is fed into the turbulence at \nlarge length scales determined e.g. by the dimensions of \na flow tube or the mesh size of a grid. Because the non-\nlinear term in (2) couples together motion on different \nlength scales, turbulent energy flows without dissipation \ntowards smaller and smaller length scales. Eventually the \nlittle eddies become so small that Re ~ 1: the dissipative \nterm in (2) then becomes important, and the energy is \ndissipated by viscosity. Within the inertial range of this \nRichardson cascade, the spectral energy density distribu-\ntion is described by the Kolmogorov spectrum \nE(k)=C\u00a32\/3k~5\/3 (3) \nwhere k is the wave number of the eddies, E(k) is the \nenergy per unit mass contained in eddies of wavenum-\nber between k and k + dk, the Kolmogorov constant C \nis of order unity, and \u00a3 determines the rate at which en-\nergy flows down the cascade. Note that the fluid dynam-\nics community commonly uses a notation where the tur-\nbulent energy is specified per unit mass, so it is of dimen-\nsion m2\/s2. \nHere we take no account of intermittency, despite \nits being a keyword of today's conventional turbulence \nresearch. We note that there is experimental evidence [9] \nstrongly suggesting that intermittency occurs in QT as \nwell, at least in the case of co-flowing He II turbulence \ngenerated between counterrotating discs [9]. Although \nits role in QT has not yet been widely recognized, there is \nlittle doubt that intermittency will become an important \nissue in future QT studies. \nQuantum turbulence \nWe first consider QT at finite T. In mechanically \ngenerated co-flowing He II, the normal and superfluid \ncomponents move together on large length scales, be-\ning strongly coupled by the action of the mutual friction \nforce. The latter arises because, although vortex lines \nconsist of an ordered flow in the superfluid component, \nthe vortex cores around which the flow rotates are part of \nthe normal fluid component1. Consequently, flows of this \nkind e.g. grid turbulence are characterised by a hydrody-\nnamics that is essentially classical on large length scales, \nclosely resembling conventional turbulence. On smaller \nscales, however, the quantum condition (1) will dominate \nand non-classical behaviour is then to be anticipated. In \nparticular, the decay of the vortex tangle is expected to \nbe driven by line reconnections [10], as sketched in Fig. \n1. They create relatively sharp cusps in the reconnected \nlines, and the fast self-induced superflow velocity causes \nrapid motion of the vortex core through the viscous nor-\nmal fluid component, leading to line shrinkage. Experi-\nments above 1 K have studied QT created between two \nFIGURE 1. Sketch showing how quantized vortices are be-\nlieved to reconnect when they cross, after Schwarz [10]. \nIn 3He-B, considered later, the cores of the quantized vortices are \nmacroscopic objects about hundred times larger than those of He \nII vortices, with complex structure that undergoes phase transitions. \nNevertheless, the concept of the mutual friction force between normal \nand superfluid components holds generally. \n188 \nDownloaded 03 Dec 2006 to 194.80.32.9.

At least in this respect, therefore, QT is \n(perhaps unexpectedly) similar to classical turbulence. \nIn the T \u2014\u2022 0 limit, the absence of normal fluid com-\nponent means that reconnections are no longer dissipa-\ntive through this mechanism (though some small dissipa-\ntion due to this process may still be expected). So, given \nthat the cascade to smaller scales cannot be terminated \nby viscous damping, what happens? We can even won-\nder whether the QT will ever decay. Physical intuition \nsuggests that it must in fact decay, given that vortices \nrepresent metastable states of the liquid - and experi-\nments (see below) confirm this tentative conclusion. The \ntheory of QT in the zero T limit and the decay mech-\nanism in this regime [1, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] is due \nespecially to Vinen, Barenghi, Brachet, Svistunov, Tsub-\nota and others. We draw attention to the ever-growing \nrole of numerical studies in such investigations. They \nFIGURE 2. Schematic diagram of cell used for measurement \nof the Landau critical velocity [14]. The field emission tips f \nwere used to inject negative ions, whose drift velocity across \nthe space between grids G3 and G4 was then measured. The \n10 mm vertical bar outside the cell on the lower right-hand side \nis to indicate the scale. \ncan now be based on a full Biot-Savart simulation of the \nmotion of vortex filaments [18, 21], as well as on the \nnon-linear Schrodinger equation (Gross-Pitaevskii equa-\ntion) [22, 23]. These studies follow the influential work \nof Schwarz [10] who recognized the importance of re-\nconnections, but in an era when the available computer \npower forced him to limit his simulations to the so-called \nlocal induction approximation, thus neglecting any pos-\nsibility of non-local interaction. Thus e.g. stretching of \nvortex lines, which is believed to play a central role in \nclassical turbulence, could not be included. \nThe picture that is emerging involves a Richardson \ncascade from the largest length scales to successively \nsmaller scales. It cannot end in viscous dissipation, as in \nthe classical case, but it is probably followed by a Kelvin \nwave cascade. Reconnections generate a high density of \nKelvin waves (vortex waves) on the lines, which mutu-\nally interact to generate Kelvin waves of successively \nhigher frequency. Those of sufficiently high frequency \ncan radiate phonons, thus terminating the cascade. What \nexperimental evidence is there to support this general \npicture? \nEarly results \nInterest in the decay of QT preceded the development \nof the theory. The experimental determination of the Lan-\ndau critical velocity for roton creation [14] involved the \nuse of the large experimental cell shown in Fig. 2. Neg-\native ions were injected from the field emission tips f, \nand their transit time across the relatively low electric \nfield region between grids G3 and G4 was measured. It \nis known that charged vortex rings and QT are created in \nthe region of very high electric field near field emission \ntips. Negative ions are trapped on vortex lines so that, \nin the absence of a QT decay mechanism, a high den-\nsity of spacecharge would have built up within the cell \nand would have prevented the experiment from working. \nThat this did not happen [14] demonstrated that a QT de-\ncay mechanism must exist even in the absence of normal \nfluid component. \nFig. 3 illustrates a preliminary experiment [24] to in-\nvestigate the decay of QT in superfluid 4He in the T \u2014\u2022 0 \nlimit. A fine-mesh grid, stretched to its yield point on a \ncircular holder, is driven on-resonance by an electrosta-\ntic field. Because of the high Q of the oscillator, and the \nfact that it is vibrating in a dissipation-free superfluid, the \namplitude rises until the critical velocity for QT genera-\ntion is attained. After the grid has been driven for a few \nseconds, the drive is switched off. When a pulse of nega-\ntive ions is passed through the QT that has been created, \nsome of the ions get trapped on the vortices, leading to \nan attenuated signal at the collector. By propagating a se-\n189 \nDownloaded 03 Dec 2006 to 194.80.32.9.

Although direct quantitative compari-\nson of the results of this experiment with the emerging \ntheoretical or computational models is difficult, it clearly \nillustrates the decay of QT on a timescale of seconds. \nEXPERIMENTS ON QT AT VERY LOW T \nTechniques for creating QT \nIn addition to the vibrating grid mentioned above, \nseveral other techniques have also been used for creating \nQT in the low T limit, illustrated in Fig. 5. \nThe most widely used of these is the oscillating wire \nloop (top) [25, 26, 27]. The loop is formed from a single \nNbTi superconducting filament etched out of the copper \nmatrix of standard magnet wire, typically x-y \/im in di-\nameter. A magnetic field is applied parallel to its legs. \nWhen an oscillatory current is passed through the loop, \nit responds to the resultant force as shown, moving in \nthe direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and the \nwire. The induced voltage arising from the movement \ncan be measured directly, there being no voltage due to \nthe current in the static wire on account of its supercon-\nductivity (and we ignore the possibility of flux motion \nwithin the wire, associated with its movement). \nAt small driving amplitudes the response is usually \nlinear, corresponding to laminar flow. Under these condi-\ntions the superfluid makes no contribution to the damp-\ning, but just provides an added hydrodynamic mass (see \nbelow). When the driving amplitude is such that a criti-\ncal velocity is attained there is a sudden change in the re-\nField \nemission tip \nTop electrode \nOscillating \u2022 \nHVgrid \nBottom electrode \nFr isc tagr id ' \\j~ -Collector \nFIGURE 3.

In the cross-\nover regime, a variety of interesting phenomena can ap-\npear, including hysteresis and intermittent switching be-\ntween laminar and turbulent flow. \nThe oscillating microsphere (Fig. 5, second from top) \nbehaves in many respects rather similarly [28, 29, 30, \n31]. The magnetic sphere is levitated in He II between \nNb electrodes. It carries an electrostatic charge, and it \ncan therefore be driven by an applied oscillatory elec-\ntric field. The resultant oscillations can be detected and \nmeasured. Again, investigation of the variation of the re-\nsponse amplitude with the driving force reveals a well-\ndefined critical velocity at which there is a marked \nchange in behaviour from linear response (laminar flow) \nto a much slower increase in response with drive (be-\ncause of the creation of QT): see Fig. 6. \nA recent innovation by Bradley et al [32] (Fig. 5, third \nfrom top) has been the creation of QT in 3He-B by means \nof a grid mounted on a loop of superconducting wire. The \ngrid material is identical to that used in the earlier work \nin He II [24, 33, 34], but it is moved magnetically rather \nthan electrostatically. The authors report convincing ev-\nidence (see below) of QT production in 3He-B when a \ncritical velocity of the grid is exceeded. \nA very recent innovation is the use of an oscillating \nquartz tuning fork [35]. The legs of the fork (Fig. 5, \nbottom) are about 3.4 mm in length, each with a cross-\nsection of 400x400 \/im2 . They oscillate in antiphase at a \nfrequency of ^ 3 0 kHz. Preliminary studies suggest that \nthe behaviour of the fork in superfluid is generally similar \nto that of other vibrating objects in that it creates QT once \n2\n In 3He-B there is also a critical threshold associated with reaching \nthe pair-breaking velocity [26]. The Landau critical velocity for roton \ncreation in He II [14] is many orders of magnitude larger than those at \nwhich QT is generated, and can be ignored in the present context. \n190 \nDownloaded 03 Dec 2006 to 194.80.32.9.

It is characterised \nby robustness, small size, and a high Q of up to 105, and \nthere may be other advantages. These devices are under \nactive investigation in Helsinki, Kosice, Lancaster and \nPrague in terms of their potential for thermometry and \nparticle detection, as well as for QT creation, both in He \nII and superfluid phases of 3He. \nFIGURE 5. Other techniques used for creation of QT in \nsuperfluid 4He and 3He at very low T. From the top: vibrating \nwire loop [25, 26, 27]; oscillating levitated sphere [28, 29, 30, \n31]; vibrating grid, on wire loop (with two additional loops as \ndetectors) [32]; vibrating quartz fork [35]. \nAll of the techniques shown in Figs. 3 and 5 in-\nvolve the oscillation of a submerged object of some kind \nwithin the superfluid. Despite obvious cryogenic advan-\ntages this is not, in fact, ideal as a method of creating \nQT (see Discussion below) in that one aims to create a \nwell-defined turbulent flow that can be approximated as \nhomogeneous and isotropic in order to compare it with \navailable theoretical models. \nHydrodynamic mass in a superfluid \nThe superfluid is inviscid and, provided that there \nare no free surfaces on which waves can be created, \nit causes no drag on an object moving at low velocity. \nNonetheless, there are inertial effects associated with the \nneed to push the superfluid out of the way. This is the \norigin of the classical hydrodynamic mass enhancement \nof \nAM = pVp (4) \nwhere \/3 is a geometrical constant, V is the volume of \nthe moving object, and p is the density of the fluid. The \ndynamics of a moving object in the superfluid in the \nT \u2014\u2022 0 limit are therefore identical to what they would \nbe in a vacuum, except for the modified effective mass. \nExperiments with negative ion bubbles [36] confirm this \npicture. \nFor oscillating material objects submerged in He II, \nhowever, there are indications [37, 38] that the effective \nmass is enhanced by more than just the classical AM, \neven within the linear regime of low oscillatory ampli-\ntude. In the case of the oscillating grid, the constant \/3 \ncannot reliably be evaluated because of the ill-defined \nthough approximately rectangular cross-section of the \ngrid wires, but Charalambous et al [37] arrive at this con-\nclusion through investigation of the density (pressure) \ndependence of the resonant frequency. The wire used by \nYano et al [38] is smooth and circular in cross-section, \nso that the value of \/3 = 1 for an infinite cylinder can \nbe assumed. The radius of the wire calculated from the \nmeasured hydrodynamic mass is significantly larger than \nthe actual radius as determined by electron microscopy, \ni.e. the effective mass is larger than expected. It seems \nextremely likely that the physics underlying the anom-\nalous mass enhancement is the same in both experiments \n[37, 38]. The origin of the effect has yet to be established, \nbut one possibility is that surfaces exposed to superfluid \nbecome covered in a \"fur\" of small vortex loops that can \nthen add [39] to the inertial effective mass. The general \npicture would be qualitatively similar to that considered \nby Kusmartsev [40] in trying to account for critical ve-\nlocities in the flow of rotating superfluid 4He. He en-\nvisaged the creation by fluctuations of a plasma of half-\nvortex rings at the wall. In terms of this picture, the con-\n191 \nDownloaded 03 Dec 2006 to 194.80.32.9.

But many problems need to be resolved \n(e.g. the stability of pinned vortex half-rings) before any \nfirm conclusion can be drawn. \nThe seemingly anomalous effective mass of objects \noscillating in the superfluid does not bear directly on \nQT as such, but the underlying physics may be highly \nrelevant to the critical velocity that must be exceeded to \ninitiate QT creation. \nTechniques for detecting QT \nExperiments on QT in He II above 1 K [11, 12] have \nused the attenuation of second sound to detect the vor-\ntices, almost universally. It is an extremely sensitive tech-\nnique: using a resonant cavity, it can even enable the \ndetection of individual vortex lines. Unfortunately, how-\never, it is applicable neither in the low T range for He II \nbecause second sound (involving antiphase oscillation of \nthe normal and superfluid components) cannot exist in \nthe absence of normal fluid component, nor in superfluid \nphases of 3He where second sound is heavily damped. \nMost experiments on QT in He II in the T \u2014\u2022 0 limit \nhave detected its creation indirectly, by observing the os-\ncillatory dynamics of the moving object. In particular, \nthe response as a function of the amplitude of the driving \nforce usually undergoes a marked change at the transition \nbetween laminar flow and QT creation: see e.g. the oscil-\nlating microsphere data of Fig. 6. Although this approach \nprovides evidence of QT production, it does not allow \ncomparison with the theory described above. Exceptions \ninclude the preliminary 4He experiment [24] where ion \ntrapping was used as a detection method. \n-400 -200 200 400 \nF(pN) \n600 800 \nFIGURE 6. Plot of response as a function of forcing ampli \ntude for the magnetically levitated microsphere [30]. \nQT in 3He can be detected by application of the pow-\nerful technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). \nIndeed, the temperature induced transition from laminar \nto turbulent flow in 3He-B at ~ 0.6 Tc was observed by \nNMR in a rotating sample when one or few vortex seed \nloops were injected into the originally vortex-free Lan-\ndau state [42]. However, the NMR technique used is sen-\nsitive mainly to the large-scale counterflow rather than to \nthe signal from vortex cores; and its use at lower temper-\natures becomes increasingly difficult. In experiments by \nBradley et al [32] QT in 3He-B generated by the elec-\ntromagnetically oscillating grid (see above) was detected \nas a decrease in damping sensed by the nearby vibrating \nwire: the underlying physics is based on Andreev scat-\ntering (the incoming quasiparticle is back-scattered as \na quasihole and vice versa) of ballistically propagating \nquasiparticles. The Andreev scattering channel appears \nthrough Galilean modification of the quasiparticle dis-\npersion relation due to circulating superflow around the \nvortex core [43]. \nDISCUSSION \nSeveral experiments show that QT can be created at low \nT, and there are two [24, 32] which clearly demonstrate \nthat it decays on a timescale of several seconds. It has \nnot yet, however, been possible to make a detailed com-\nparison with theory. The main problem is that submerged \noscillating objects create QT that is not formed at a well-\ndefined initial length scale, because the object repeatedly \ntraverses the QT that it has created, thus chopping it up \ninto ill-defined smaller elements. The other problems are \nthat the QT is not homogeneous: it may stay localised \nnear the oscillating object, so that its density then de-\ncreases sharply with distance. Another source of inhomo-\ngeneity is that flow across the moving object often occurs \nat different speeds in different positions. A further com-\nplication is that the transition to turbulence due to sub-\nmerged oscillating objects represents a problem which is \nas yet only partly understood, even for classical viscous \nflows. Experiments with flows due to e.g. a transversally \noscillating cylinder [44], or an oscillating grid in water \n[45], displayed very rich and complex flow phenomena. \nThis makes comparison of classical and quantum flows, \nand the problem of understanding the latter, extremely \ndifficult. \nThe ideal QT experiment would somehow emulate \nthe techniques used earlier above 1 K [11], in which \na grid was drawn once through a column of liquid to \ncreate well-characterised homogeneous QT which was \nthen detected with enormous sensitivity by use of second \nsound. For obvious reasons, this is extremely difficult \nto accomplish at very low T. QT creation by linear \nmechanical movement must be accomplished without \n192 \nDownloaded 03 Dec 2006 to 194.80.32.9.

To avoid friction, the \ngrid is to be moved on magnetic bearings. The result \nis the levitated, superconducting, linear, stepper motor3 \nsketched in Fig. 7. It is hoped that this device will avoid \nmany of the disadvantages of the earlier oscillatory QT \ncreation methods. \nNew techniques will also be required to detect the QT. \nThere are two problems associated with the use of neg-\native ions. First, although the capture cross-section in \nHe II has not yet been measured in the T \u2014\u2022 0 limit, it \nis certainly very small [46] and probably highly depen-\ndent on electric field. So ions can only be suitable for \nthe detection of QT at relatively high density and will \nprobably not allow coverage of the wide range of densi-\nties needed for a detailed comparison with experiment. \nSecondly, they must be to some extent invasive probes in \nthat any electric field, including their own spacecharge \nfield, will apply a force to the QT, an effect that could be \nsignificant under certain circumstances. \nThe use of ions for QT detection in the superfluid \nphases of 3He seems even more difficult, in view of a \nmuch larger size of the vortex cores leading to smaller \nsubstitution energy and presumably a smaller capture \ncross-section. The use of NMR and especially the novel \ndetection technique based on Andreev scattering (see \nabove) seem promising here. There is a clear call for \ncomplementary experiments probing comparable flows \nin He II and 3He in the T -> 0 limit. \nFurther detection techniques currently under consider-\nation include the use of: (a) calorimetry, which is sen-\nsitive but where it will be difficult to analyse the data \nfor comparison with the theory; (b) tracers, e.g. excited \nHe II molecules; and (c) miniature pressure transducers. \nThe options are discussed by Vinen in these Proceedings \n[47]. \nLiquid He-4 cell Towed grid \nPure Nb \nhollow \ncylinders \nInner Vacuum \nChamber \nQuadrupole \nMumetal \nsheet \nSupport \nrods \nDrive magnet \nMumetal \nsheet \nQuadrupole \nFIGURE 7.

The study \nof QT in this range not only brings intrinsic interest of \nturbulence in a pure superfluid, but also represents a ma-\njor intellectual challenge. As a consequence of the quan-\ntized circulation in superfluids it introduces new physics, \ne.g. the Kelvin wave cascades. Although adequate tests \nof the theory require the introduction of new experimen-\n3\n Designed and built in collaboration with W.F.
