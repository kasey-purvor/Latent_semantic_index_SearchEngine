In fact, such\nexercises do not appear to be any more effective in this regard than\nweight training at a relatively slow cadence, and some evidence\nsuggests they are less so. Also, such explosive exercises do not transfer\nwell (if at all) to athletic performance on the sports field, and present a\nsignificant injury risk. Therefore, such exercises should not be\nrecommended in the strength and conditioning training of athletes,\nexcept those who need to learn the specific skill of lifting heavy weights\nfast, such as Olympic lifters and strongmen.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/faculty.css.edu\/tboone2\/asep\/Bruce-LoweFeb2007.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>American Society of Exercise Physiologists<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-11-17T12:26:16Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>Journal of exercise physiology - online, 2007, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 21-33<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1097-9751<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/86302<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.asep.org\/journals\/JEPonline<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/faculty.css.edu\/tboone2\/asep\/Bruce-LoweFeb2007.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/www.asep.org\/journals\/JEPonline","http:\/\/faculty.css.edu\/tboone2\/asep\/Bruce-LoweFeb2007.pdf"],"year":2009,"topics":["Strength","Plyometrics","Performance"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
