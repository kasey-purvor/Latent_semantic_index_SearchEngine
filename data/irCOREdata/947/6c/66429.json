Introduction\nRecent observations of H2D+ (Caselli et al. 2003; Ceccarelli\net al. 2004) and additionally of D2H+ (Vastel et al. 2004) have\nprovided striking evidence of the extent of deuteration of H+3 in\nthe cold, dense gas of the interstellar medium. The removal of\n\u201cheavy\u201d molecules, i.e. molecules containing elements heav-\nier than helium, is believed to occur at high densities (nH >\u223c\n105 cm\u22123) and low temperatures (T <\u223c 10 K) by adsorption on\nto grains. It is accompanied by deuteration reactions with HD\nalong the exothermic sequence H+3 \u2192 H2D+ \u2192 D2H+ \u2192 D+3\n(Roberts et al. 2003; Walmsley et al. 2004). Observations of\nthe deuterated forms of H+3 , in conjunction with models of the\ndeuteration process, enable information to be obtained on the\nconditions in media where stars are beginning to form, through\ngravitational contraction.\nAll four of the molecular ions H+3 , H2D\n+\n, D2H+ and D+3\nhave \u201cortho\u201d and \u201cpara\u201d (and, in the case of D+3 , \u201cmeta\u201d)\nforms, corresponding to the spin states of the protons (in H+3\nand H2D+) or the deuterons (in D2H+ and D+3 ). Models of the\ndeuteration process should distinguish between these forms,\nnot only because the observations relate to specific modi-\nfications (ortho-H2D+ and para-D2H+) but also because the\nexo\/endothermicities of the forwards and reverse reactions in-\nvolved in deuteration depend on the forms of the reactants and\nproducts. The ortho:para ratios of the species H+3 and H2D+ are\nlinked to the ratio of ortho- to para-H2 (which are produced in\n\u0001 Table A.1 is only available in electronic form at\nhttp:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\ngrain-surface reactions), through the proton-exchanging reac-\ntion of H+3 with H2 and the formation of H2D+ in the reaction\nH+3 (HD, H2)H2D+. On the other hand, the abundances of the\northo and para forms of D2H+, and the ortho, para and meta\nforms of D+3 are determined by reactions (principally with HD,\nwhich is also produced on grains) which modify the overall\nspin symmetry of the deuterons. Deuterons, unlike protons,\nhave spin I = 1 and hence obey Bose-Einstein statistical laws.\nIn the present paper, we build on and extend our previous\nstudy of complete depletion in pre-protostellar cores by con-\nsidering explicitly the ortho and para forms of D2H+ and other\nspecies containing two deuterons, and the ortho and meta forms\nof D+3 . We determine their dependence on the physical condi-\ntions in the medium, including the properties of the grains. As\ndefined in Sect. 2 of our previous paper, \u201ccomplete depletion\u201d\nimplies gas-phase fractional abundances of species such as CO\nmuch less than 10\u22126.\n2. Chemical model\nThe multiply-deuterated species D2, D+2 , D2H\n+ and D+3 have\nbeen incorporated already in our previous model (Walmsley\net al. 2004). However, we assumed that the chemical reactions\nimplicated only their lowest energy states, of ortho symme-\ntry. We now extend our study by considering the other modi-\nfications of these multiply-deuterated species. We discuss first\nthose species containing two deuterons, and then D+3 separately.\n888 D. R. Flower et al.: Multiply-deuterated species in prestellar cores\nTable 1. Statistical properties of the ortho and para forms of D2 (Herzberg 1950). The ortho nuclear spin states are associated with even values\nof the rotational quantum number, J, and the para states with odd J. Only the lowest rotational level of each modification was included in the\nmodel. For D+2 and D2H+, the statistical properties of the lowest ortho and para levels are the same as in the case of D2; but the lowest para\nlevel lies 42.0 K and 50.2 K, respectively, above the lowest ortho level, which is the ground level (Polyansky & Tennyson 1999; Ramanlal &\nTennyson 2004).\nModification Itot\n\u2211(2Itot + 1) J (2J + 1) (2J + 1)\u2211(2Itot + 1) EJ (K)\northo 0, 2 6 0 1 6 0\npara 1 3 1 3 9 86.0\nTable 2. Statistical properties of the energy levels of D+3 with J = 0 and J = 1. J is the rotational quantum number and K its projection on the\nmolecular symmetry axis; gI is the nuclear spin statistical weight. Only the two lowest energy levels, of A1 and E symmetry, were included in\nthe model. The energies were computed by Polyansky & Tennyson (1999). Note that 1 cm\u22121 \u2261 1.4388 K.\nJ K Energy (cm\u22121) Symmetry Modification gI (2J + 1)g(Itot) EJK (K)\n0 0 0.000 A1 ortho 10 10 0.0\n1 1 32.331 E meta 8 24 46.5\n1 0 43.619 A2 para 1 3 62.8\n2.1. Species containing two deuterons\nThe template in this case is D2, whose spectroscopic proper-\nties were discussed by Herzberg (1950). A deuteron has a spin\nquantum number I = 1 and a spin statistical weight 2I + 1 = 3.\nThe total spin statistical weight of D2 is\n\u220f2\ni=1(2Ii + 1) = 9,\nwhere the deuterons are labelled \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d. Of the three pos-\nsible values of the resultant nuclear spin, Itot = 0, 1, 2, two\n(Itot = 0, 2) are associated with states which are symmetric un-\nder exchange of the (identical) deuterons, whereas Itot = 1 is\nassociated with states which are antisymmetric under deuteron\nexchange. The symmetric states, which are\n\u2211(2Itot + 1) = 6\nin number, are denoted \u201cortho\u201d, whereas the 3 antisymmet-\nric states are denoted \u201cpara\u201d. These facts are summarized in\nTable 1.\nWhen Bose-Einstein statistical laws apply, as here, the to-\ntal (nuclear) wave function, which is a product of the spin and\nthe rotational components, must be symmetric under exchange\nof identical bosons. As the rotational wave function has sym-\nmetry (\u22121)J under exchange of the nucleons, where J is the\nrotational quantum number, it follows that the lowest rotational\nlevel, J = 0, must have ortho symmetry, and the first excited\nlevel, J = 1, must have para symmetry. Thus, the total statis-\ntical weight of the ground rotational level is 6, whereas that of\nthe first excited rotational level is 9 (cf. Table 1). The first ex-\ncited level lies at an energy EJ=1\/k = 86.0 K above the J = 0\nground level (Herzberg 1950). We neglect levels J \u2265 2, taking\nJ = 0 to represent the ortho levels and J = 1 to represent the\npara levels. In the case of D+2 , the J = 1 level lies 42.0 K above\nJ = 0 (using the spectroscopic constants of Herzberg (1950)\nfor H+2 and allowing for the different reduced mass of D\n+\n2 ). In\nD2H+, the lowest para level lies 50.2 K above the lowest or-\ntho (ground) level (Polyansky & Tennyson 1999; Ramanlal &\nTennyson 2004).\n2.2. D+3\nThe triply deuterated form of H+3 (D+3 ), needs separate consid-\neration. Polyansky & Tennyson (1999) computed the energies\nof the rovibrational levels of H+3 and all its deuterated isotopes,\nincluding D+3 , to spectroscopic accuracy. Ramanlal & Tennyson\n(2004) have recently provided the corresponding radiative tran-\nsition probabilities.\nIn Table 2 are shown the lowest energy states of D+3 , to-\ngether with their computed energies. Following the presenta-\ntion by Townes & Schawlow (1955; see their Table 3-6), we\ndeduce that: the lowest (ground) level, of A1 symmetry, has\na nuclear spin statistical weight, gI = 10; the first excited\nstate, of E symmetry, has gI = 8; and the second excited state,\nof A2 symmetry, has gI = 1. The statistical weights and as-\nsociated energies are listed in Table 2. We neglect the second\nexcited state, of A2 symmetry, which has the lowest statisti-\ncal weight. The ground state, which has the highest statistical\nweight (10), is denoted \u201cortho\u201d, and the first excited state is\ndenoted \u201cmeta\u201d; the second excited state, which we neglect, is\ndenoted \u201cpara\u201d. Although the use of terms such as \u201cortho\u201d and\n\u201cpara\u201d is not strictly appropriate in this case, it serves to dis-\ntinguish the energy levels. Thus, the \u201cortho\u201d level is again the\nlowest, with a total statistical weight (the product of the nuclear\nspin statistical weight, gI , with (2J+1)) of 10. The \u201cmeta\u201d level\nhas a total statistical weight of 24.\n3. Results\nOur previous study (Walmsley et al. 2004) was directed to-\nwards understanding the observation of ortho-H2D+ in L1544;\nthe \u201cortho\u201d, \u201cpara\u201d and \u201cmeta\u201d forms of multiply-deuterated\nspecies were not distinguished in those calculations. We have\nsince found that the introduction of the distinction between\nthe modifications has only modest effects on the results which\nwe obtained and presented previously. Figure 1 illustrates this\nclose similarity; it should be compared with Fig. 2 of Walmsley\net al. (2004) and applies to the \u201creference\u201d model: a grain ra-\ndius ag = 0.1 \u00b5m, a kinetic temperature T = 10 K, and a cos-\nmic ray ionization rate \u03b6 = 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121. As previously, the\nfractional abundances which we plot are those in steady state.\nD. R.

We shall con-\nsider variations with respect to the gas density and temperature\nand the grain radius.\n3.1. Dependence on n(H2 )\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the ratios para\/ortho D2H+, meta\/ortho D+3 ,\nand para\/ortho D2 as functions of the molecular hydrogen den-\nsity. It should be recalled that \u201cortho\u201d refers to the lowest\n(ground) state and \u201cpara\u201d or \u201cmeta\u201d to the first excited state of\nthese multiply-deuterated species. Results are given for the ref-\nerence model (ag = 0.1 \u00b5m, T = 10 K, and \u03b6 = 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121).\nIn all three cases (D2H+, D+3 , and D2), the ratio of the ex-\ncited to the ground state population density decreases with nH,\nowing to the enhanced rates of deuteron exchange reactions,\nwhich interconnect the modifications. The para\/ortho D2H+\nand meta\/ortho D+3 ratios are determined principally by\ndeuteron-exchanging reactions with HD, whose fractional\nabundance, n(HD)\/n(H2), is almost independent of n(H2), as\nmay be seen from Fig. 3. (Most of the deuterium in the medium\nis present in the form of HD, and of hydrogen in the form of H2,\nand hence n(HD)\/n(H2) \u2248 2nD\/nH = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125.)\nIn local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) at T = 10 K,\nthe ratios of the excited to ground state densities are 0.045,\n0.010, and 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 for D+3 , D2H+, and D2, respectively.\nThus, even at n(H2) = 107 cm\u22123, none of these ratios has\nreached its LTE value. The para\/ortho D2 ratio is determined\nby dissociative recombination of D+3 with electrons in the gas\nphase and on the surfaces of negatively charged grains and,\nat high densities, by deuteron-exchanging reactions with D+3 ,\nwhich becomes the major ion (cf. Fig. 1). The fact that reac-\ntions involving five deuterons should assume significance is\nindicative of the very particular conditions which prevail in\npre-protostellar cores. These same deuteron-exchanging reac-\ntions of D2 with D+3 also have some influence on the meta\/ortho\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n105 106 107\nn(H2)  (cm\n- 3)\np\/o-D2\nm\/o-D3\n+p\/o-D2H\n+\nFig. 2.

However, the fractional\nabundance of D2, [D2] < [HD], as Fig. 3 shows, and so the\nmeta\/ortho D+3 and para\/ortho D2H+ ratios are determined prin-\ncipally by deuteron-exchanging reactions with HD, as already\nmentioned. As may be seen from Fig. 3, the fractional abun-\ndance of atomic D approaches that of H at high density.\n3.2. Dependence on T\nAs the temperature of the gas increases, the degree of deuter-\nation of H+3 is expected to fall, owing to the reverse se-\nquence D+3 \u2192 D2H+ \u2192 H2D+ \u2192 H+3 ; these reactions, with H2,\nare endothermic (Ramanlal et al. 2003) and their rates increase\n890 D.

Also\nplotted in these Figures are the values of the ratios correspond-\ning to LTE.\nUnder conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, when the\nrates per unit volume of forwards and reverse reactions are\nequal, the reaction para-H+3 (HD, para-H2) para-H2D+, which\nis exoergic by 232 K in the forwards direction, would give rise\nto an abundance ratio\nn (H2D+)\nn\n(\nH+3\n) =\nk f\nkr\nexp(232\/T )n(HD)\nn (H2) \u00b7\nTaking k f = 1.17 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121, kr = 1.40 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121,\nand n(HD)\/n(para-H2) = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125, we obtain\nn (H2D+)\nn\n(\nH+3\n) = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22125exp(232\/T ).\nFigure 4 shows that the calculated abundance ratio tends to-\nwards its LTE value as T increases, although only slowly\nbecause of the large energy defect involved in the para-\nH+3 (HD, para-H2)para-H2D+ reaction. The para\/ortho D2H+\nand meta\/ortho D+3 ratios also approach their LTE values\nwith increasing T , as may be seen in Fig. 5. However, the\npara\/ortho D2H+ ratio has still not reached its LTE value\nat T = 50 K. Furthermore, the meta\/ortho D+3 ratio does\nnot attain its LTE value, owing to reactions other than those\n(with HD) which interconvert the ortho and meta forms. Both\nthe para\/ortho ratio of D2H+ and the meta\/ortho ratio of D+3\nare superthermal at low T . The exoergicities of the deutera-\ntion reactions H2D+(HD, H2)D2H+ and D2H+(HD, H2)D+3 are\nsufficient to give rise to overpopulation of the excited (para\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n9 10 20 30 40\np\/\no \nra\ntio\nT (K)\n9\/6 exp (-50.2\/T)\np\/o-D2H\n+\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n9 10 20 30 40\nm\n\/o\n ra\ntio\nT (K)\n24\/10 exp (-46.5\/T)\nm\/o-D3\n+\nFig. 5.

Thus, the assumption that the gas ki-\nnetic temperature may be derived from the observed value of\nthis ratio, assuming LTE, is not valid at low T . In fact, the cal-\nculated values of the ratios plotted in Fig. 6 are double-valued:\nwithin certain ranges, the observed values of these ratios can\ncorrespond to either low-temperature non-LTE or higher tem-\nperature LTE solutions.\nVastel et al. (2004) have measured the column densities of\northo-H2D+ and para-D2H+ in the prestellar core 16293E, ob-\ntaining a ratio N(para-D2H+)\/N(ortho-H2D+) = 0.75 for an ex-\ncitation temperature Tex = 10 K (and assuming that the source\nis more extended that the observing beam). The calculated\nvalue of the ratio n(para-D2H+)\/n(ortho-H2D+), as a function\nof T , is shown in Fig. 7. It may be seen from Fig. 7 that the\nD. R.

The values of the ratios in LTE are also plotted.\nvalue calculated at T = 10 K is consistent with that \u201cobserved\u201d.\nHowever, we have just shown that neither the para\/ortho D2H+\nnor the ortho\/para H2D+ ratio is in LTE at T = 10 K, and so this\napparently good agreement should be viewed with circumspec-\ntion. Moreover, the work of Mizuno et al. (1990) and Stark et al.\n(2004) suggests that a temperature in the range 12 \u2264 T \u2264 16 K\nmay be more appropriate to 16293E.\nThe ortho\/para H2D+ and para\/ortho D2H+ ratios are su-\nperthermal at low T . Thermalization (with increasing T ) leads\nto an initial decrease in both ratios, with the first decreasing\nfaster than the second owing to the larger ortho:para separation\nin H2D+ (86 K, as compared with 50 K in D2H+). Thus, the\nratio n(para-D2H+)\/n(ortho-H2D+) tends to increase with T at\nlow T . As LTE is approached, these trends are reversed, with\northo\/para H2D+ increasing faster than para\/ortho D2H+, and\nhence n(para-D2H+)\/n(ortho-H2D+) decreases as T increases\nfurther, as may be seen in Fig. 7.\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n10 12 14 16 18 20\np-\nD\n2H\n+\n \n\/ o\n-H\n2D\n+\nT (K)\np-D2H\n+\n \/ o-H2D\n+\nFig. 7.

Dependence on ag\nIn our calculations, we have assumed all the grains to have the\nsame size, but we have investigated the dependence of the re-\nsults on the grain radius, ag. We recall that it is the grain sur-\nface area per hydrogen nucleus which is relevant to the rates of\ngas-grain reactions.\nAs in our previous paper (Walmsley et al. 2004), we present\nresults with reference to a model with the grain parameters\nag = 0.1 \u00b5m and \u03c1g = 2 g cm\u22123, where \u03c1g is the mean density\nof the grain material (core and ice mantle). To these param-\neters corresponds a grain surface area per hydrogen nucleus\nng \u03c3g\/nH = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221221 (0.10\/ag(\u00b5m)) cm2.\nIn Fig. 8, we plot the fractional abundances of the major\nions and the free electron abundance against ag, for a density\nof nH = 2 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 and T = 10 K. As the grain size increases,\n892 D. R. Flower et al.: Multiply-deuterated species in prestellar cores\n0\n5\n10\n15\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\na (\u00b5m)\no\/p-D2\no\/m-D3\n+\no\/p-D2H+\nFig. 9.

Polyatomic ions recombine\nrapidly (dissociatively) with free electrons and on the surfaces\nof negatively charged grains. On the other hand, H+ recombines\nonly slowly (radiatively) with free electrons but rapidly on the\nsurfaces of negatively charged grains (which act as a third body\nand effectively catalyse the recombination reaction). Hence, the\nfraction of H+ increases with ag, and H+ becomes the major ion\n(when ag >\u223c 0.1 \u00b5m, for n(H2) = 106 cm\u22123 and T = 10 K). The\nfraction of polyatomic ions first increases with the grain radius,\nas the number density of negatively charged grains decreases,\nthen decreases as recombination with free electrons takes over.\nThus, [D+3 ] has a maximum in the vicinity of ag = 0.1 \u00b5m.\nReferring now to Fig. 9, we see that the maximum in [D+3 ] is\nreflected in the variation of the ortho\/para D2 ratio. The or-\ntho\/para D2H+ and ortho\/meta D+3 ratios, on the other hand, are\napproximately constant: they are determined by deuteron ex-\nchange with HD, whose fractional abundance is independent\nof ag (as well as being independent of nH).\n4. Observational perspectives\nWe consider in this Section the prospects of observing directly\neither the ortho\/para (ortho\/meta) ratios or the relative abun-\ndances of the different deuterated forms of H+3 . Some pertinent\nobservations have already been made. Vastel et al. (2004) have\nshown that H2D+ and D2H+ have comparable column densities,\nof the order of 1013 cm\u22122, in the prestellar core 16293E; this\nobservational result is compatible with the models discussed\nabove. At densities in excess of 106 cm\u22123, the most abundant\nion is likely to be either D+3 or H+, depending on the grain\nsize. It follows that the total number density of positive ions is\nconsiderably larger than the sum of the abundances of H2D+\nand D2H+. In particular, a measurement of the fractional\nabundance of H2D+ provides only a lower limit to the degree\nof ionization.\nH2D+ has been detected recently in the outer parts of\nthe circumstellar disk surrounding the T Tauri star DM Tau\n(Ceccarelli et al. 2004), and the discussion in the present paper\nmay be relevant to such objects. Once again, the determination\nof the ionization degree from the observations is complicated\nby our ignorance of the grain size in the relevant disk layer.\nWhilst H2D+ and D2H+ can be (and have been) observed at\nsub-mm wavelengths, H+3 and D+3 lack a permanent dipole mo-\nment and consequently do not emit detectable rotational tran-\nsitions. However, vibrational transitions are allowed in both\nspecies, and H+3 has been observed, in the near infrared, in ab-\nsorption towards strong background sources (e.g. McCall et al.\n1999). Therefore, we have considered the observability, in the\nnear infrared, of the deuterated forms of H+3 , assuming that the\nconditions are similar to those under which H+3 itself has been\ndetected. The sub-mm detections of H2D+ and D2H+ yield frac-\ntional abundances of the order of 10\u221210, assuming a hydrogen\ncolumn density of the order of 1023 cm\u22122; this value is typi-\ncal of some prestellar cores (Bacmann et al. 2000) and corre-\nsponds to 50 mag of visual extinction, or approximately 2 mag\nat the wavelengths (around 5 \u00b5m) of the lines in Table 3. In\nthis table are given, for several relevant transitions, the com-\nputed column density, N\u03c4=1, for absorption from the lower\nlevel of a line for which the optical depth at the line centre,\n\u03c4 = 1 (see, for example, Eq. (B12) of Tielens & Hollenbach\n1985). We adopted a line width of 1 km s\u22121. In Table 3 we give\nalso the excitation energy, El, of the lower level of the transi-\ntion, relative to the ground level, and the transition wavelength.\nThe A-values and quantum numbers have been taken from\nRamanlal & Tennyson (2004): (J,Ka,Kc) in the case of H2D+\nand D2H+; and (\u03bd1, \u03bd2, J,G,U) in the case of D+3 . We see that\nthe computed column densities are of the order of 1014 cm\u22122,\nand so several lines of the deuterated forms of H+3 might be de-\ntectable, with optical depths at the line centre of the order of 0.1\n(depending on the line width). Most of the transitions fall out-\nside the M and L windows and would be observable only from\nabove the atmosphere. Such observations may be the best way\nof determining the abundances of the ortho, para and (in the\ncase of D+3 ) meta forms of the isotopes of H+3 .\nAppendix A: Additional chemical reactions\nand their rate coefficients\nIn this appendix are specified the additional reactions included\nto allow for the consequences of Bose-Einstein statistics on the\nabundances of multiply-deuterated species, as determined by\nour chemical model. As the abundance of D in the gas-phase\ncan become comparable with that of H, the formation of para-\nand ortho-D2 on grain surfaces is included in the reaction set,\nin addition to the formation of para- and ortho-H2 and of HD.\nAppendix B: A simplified analysis\nof the meta\/ortho D+\n3\nabundance ratio\nMeta-D+3 and ortho-D\n+\n3 are produced with approximately equal\nprobability in the reactions D2H+(HD, H2)D+3 , as may be seen\nD.

The analogous\nderivation of the para\/ortho D2H+ ratio would yield a qualita-\ntively similar result.\nAcknowledgements.
