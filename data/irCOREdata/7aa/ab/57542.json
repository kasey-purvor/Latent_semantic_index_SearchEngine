Traditionally this has been on paper, and in \nrecent years in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). \n  \nAt the outset of geological surveying and map-making in 1815 William Smith used a \ncross-section to illustrate the third dimension of British geology on the classic first \ngeological map. Over time more refined section drawing resulted in outputs such as fence \ndiagrams, ribbon diagrams and block diagrams to show the 3-D structure, while \ncontouring was used to show the nature of individual horizons such as major \nunconformities or the thickness variations of units or sequences (isopach maps).  \n \nIn the last 3 decades the advancement in the processing power of computers has enabled \nscientists to create 3-D models of geological structures. First these were simple meshed \nsurfaces of which perspective views could be obtained whereas today they are solid \nmodels of highly complex structural features or entire sedimentary basins. Many of the \nearly developments were pioneered in the hydrocarbon and mining industries resulting in \ncomplex proprietary modeling softwares that were operated by a small number of \nspecialists. Now more intuitive affordable software solutions are being rolled out to large \nnumbers of geologists to produce shallow sub-surface geological models for a range of \nuses. Our organisation the British Geological Survey (BGS) is undergoing this \ntransformation from a mapping to a modeling culture mainly using the Geological \nSurveying and Investigation in 3D (GSI3D) software tool and methodology as described \nin this article.  \n \nBGS has begun to produce 3-D geological models of the shallow sub-surface (0-200m), \nthe major zone of human interaction, with the initial emphasis on major urban areas and \naquifers. These models commonly include detailed information on artificial (man-made) \ndeposits, superficial geology and the upper parts of the bedrock environment. \n \nThese models are an essential first step towards a future where geologists will have to \ndevelop much more integrated 3-4D modeling of the surface and sub-surface, in \npartnership with all the other environmental sciences. The geology will form the  \nframework, or backdrop, within which processes and temporal changes are modelled at a \nseries of resolutions. \n \nThis is a logical scientific progression and responds to the societal and political pressures \nto understand and mitigate the effects of climate and environmental change and forecast \nthe impacts of these changes on the global population.  \nData types used \n \nKey datasets for the GSI3D modeling software include licensed digitally geo-rectified \nnationwide topographic maps, including historic versions, satellite imagery, aerial \nphotography and digital elevation models. These are combined with data from BGS\u2019s \nborehole index and downhole logs, geological map linework that includes mass-\nmovement, artificial, superficial and bedrock geology as individual themes together with \nshallow geophysical datasets such as Seismic Refraction, Electrical Resistance \nTomography and Ground Penetrating Radar. The software enables all the available \ngeoscience information to be assembled and visualized in a 3D workspace to construct \nthe best possible geological block model. \n \nIt is essential that all these datasets are held in interoperable formats that can be \nexchanged between GSI3D and other modeling platforms and are stored in standard \nformats that will be recognizable to the next generation of software and modeling tools. \n \nBuilding the 3D geological models of shallow \nsubsurface with GSI3D \n \nIn simple terms, the GSI3D software utilizes a Digital Terrain Model as the model \ncapping surface, plus geological surface linework (maps)  and downhole borehole data to \nenable the geologist to construct regularly spaced intersecting cross sections by \ncorrelating boreholes and the outcrops-subcrops of units to produce a geological fence \ndiagram of the area (Figure 1a-c). Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along \nthe sections and the limits of the units (outcrop plus subcrop) produces a solid model \ncomprised of a series of stacked triangulated objects corresponding to each of the \ngeological units present (Figure 1d-e). Once calculated the block model can be analysed \nto solve problems as a decision support system (figure 1f-h). \n \n \n \nFigure 1 The GSI3D Modelling Workflow  \n \nThis process is intuitive and easy for all to use because it simply performs in the digital \nenvironment the techniques that geologists have been performing since the start of the \nscience. So the geologists determine the sequence of deposits, classify borehole logs, \ndraw cross-sections and define the surface and sub-surface extent of each geological unit. \nGeologists make their decisions based on their wealth of understanding of the study area, \ngeological processes, examination of exposures and theoretical knowledge gathered over \na career in geology. \n \nMore details on the software and methodology can be found at:  \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/science\/3dmodelling\/gsi3d.html   \nor http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GSI3D. \n \nMethods of model delivery \n \nFigure 2 summarizes current outputs from GSI3D modeling process. These include \nreports delivered on line as PDFs with embedded models as 3D PDF\u2019s. For users of GIS s \nstandard outputs such as grids, TINs and shapes are also supplied. However most models \nare delivered using our stand-alone Sub-surface Viewer, or browser. This frees clients \nfrom the need to purchase software to analyse the models, all that is required is a modern \nPC or laptop with a high performance graphics card. The functionality of this Viewer \nincludes uncovered geological maps, synthetic borehole prognoses synthetic cross-\nsections along specified routes, horizontal cuts of the ground at defined elevations, views \nof single geological objects, exploded views of the whole model and the ability to \ninstantly switch the model schema between different properties or attributes. Commonly \nused attributes include geological name, age, genesis plus physical properties such as \nlithology, permeability, physical strength and mineral potential. Web delivery will \nbecome the standard way in which BGS disseminates all its geological models and \ncomponent datasets in the near future. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Mechanisms of delivery of Geological models  \n \nA small demonstration model of the Thurrock area of East London together with a brief \nmanual on operation of the sub-surface viewer can be downloaded free from here \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/downloads\/start.cfm?id=536.  \nUsage of models  \n \nThese 3D geological block models as delivered in the Sub-surface Viewer have a \nthousand and one potential uses and users. Here we briefly describe two examples  \n \nThe example below shows how cookie-cuts from block models can be used in either the \nplanning or maintenance of linear routes and infrastructure. Potential applications include \nmajor highways, rail networks, inland waterways, tunnels, pipelines and electricity grid \nroutes. \n \nIn the case of planning several scenarios can be assessed to achieve a route most suitable \nfrom a geotechnical and engineering perspective. The model can be interrogated to derive \ncross-sections along a series of competing alignments or buffered as in the case below to \nproduce a ribbon of geology encompassing a specified or existing route. By switching the \nmodel attributes evaluation of factors such as ground strength, potential groundwater \nflow pathways and aggregate resource sterilisation can be assessed. Groundwater levels \ncan also be incorporated for visualisation in the model. Where no block model already \nexists the model can simply be constructed from all the existing geoscience information \nat the planning stage. The models are also potentially useful in upgrading and repairing \nour existing infrastructure. \n \nThe example below, which is for illustration only, shows the ground conditions along a \n100m wide corridor along the two major trunk roads that converge on Britain\u2019s main \ncontainer port at Felixstowe Docks in East Anglia. This network is very heavily used and \nof considerable national economic importance. The model shows a variety of thin and \ncomplex superficial glacial deposits in blues and pinks that includes regionally important \naggregate resources, these are cut by recent river and tidal deposits in yellow and brown \nthat present major engineering challenges due to their unconsolidated nature. These \nsuperficial deposits rest on Palaeogene-Cretaceous bedrock dominated by the thick and \nChalk Group in green that forms the principal aquifer of southeast England. The overall \nblock model for this area has been used in hydrogeological modelling to assess factors \nsuch as recharge potential, groundwater resources and aquifer vulnerability. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Cookie-cut block model along major highways leading to the Port of \nFelixstowe, UK   \n \n \nIn the field of hydrogeology extensive modelling has occurred in Britains\u2019 two main \naquifers the Cretaceous Chalk and the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group. Many of \nthese models have been commissioned  by the regional water companies or the regulatory \nEnvironment Agency of England and Wales. The models have been used to assess \naquifer vulnerability, recharge potential, groundwater resources and abstraction impacts, \nand also to investigate groundwater flooding events (see Figure 4) and major industrial \nand agricultural aquifer contamination resulting from spills and leakages.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4 Detailed model of the layers of Chalk Aquifer (shades of green) in the \nPatcham area of the South Downs, England together with the ground watertable \nindicating areas at surface prone to groundwater flooding events (blue at surface). \nThe orange and brown deposits are thin superficial deposits.  \n \nOther uses of block models include site-specific studies for new underground metro \nstations and other major infrastructure construction projects such as bridges, the 2012 \nOlympic site and nuclear power stations, the models are also used by some local planning \nauthorities to help evaluate future development proposals. \n \nArchaeological studies have also made use of the GSI3D technology in Cologne and \nLondon. An increasing use of models in several cities is to provide automated borehole \nprognoses for ground source heatpumps especially into the Chalk aquifer beneath \nLondon. \n \nHowever the biggest beneficiaries of the migration from maps to models are likely to be \nin geological education and public understanding of science. \n \nIn education block models can be constructed of classic areas of geology and perhaps \nexamined as a precursor and\/or follow-up to a field visit. The ability to slice and dice a \nblock model of somewhere they know having walked around the surface will \nconsiderably enhance understanding of geological structure and the visualisation \ncapability of geology students. The integrated use with fly-though visualisation systems \nsuch as Geovisionary\u2122 (http:\/\/www.virtalis.com\/content\/view\/371\/618\/) will further \nenhance the experience and make virtual field trips and geological surveying \nreconnaissance possible. Similarly the development of simple demonstration models of \nstructures such as the various types of unconformities, folds and faults that can be queried \nand dissected will lead to improved understanding of structure and geological concepts. \n \nWe also now have the tools to show the public at large what goes on beneath their feet \nand to help them understand political or planning decisions, or the resolution of disputes \nbased on our evidence and understanding of the subsurface - the domain of the geologist. \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
