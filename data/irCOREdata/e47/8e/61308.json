Stickleback kidney cells are natural targets for steroid hormones and are able to produce a protein, spiggin, in response to androgenic stimulation. We undertook a combined in vivo\/in vitro study where we used the magnitude of spiggin production as an endpoint to test the anti-androgenic properties of the pharmaceutical androgen antagonist flutamide and three environmental contaminants: the organophosphate insecticide fenitrothion, the urea-based herbicide linuron and the fungicide vinclozolin. In  vitro, kidney cells were exposed to a range of concentrations [from 10-14M (2.5pg\/L) up to 10-6M (280\u03bcg\/L)] of the test compounds alone for determining agonist activities, or together with 10-8M (3\u03bcg\/L) dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for determining antagonist activities. An in vivo flow-trough aquarium-based study was carried out in parallel. Female sticklebacks were exposed to a range of concentrations of the same chemicals alone or in combination with DHT (5\u03bcg\/L) for 21 days. All of the compounds significantly inhibited DHT-induced spiggin production in a concentration-dependent manner in both the in vitro (FN\u2265FL\u2265LN>VZ) and in  vivo (FN>FL\u2265VZ>LN) assays. Fenitrothion and flutamide inhibited spiggin production in  vitro at a concentration as low as 10-12M (P<0.05), while linuron and vinclozolin inhibited DHT-induced spiggin production at concentrations of 10-10M (P<0.05) and 10-6M (P<0.001) respectively. Similarly, fenitrothion and flutamide were the most potent chemicals in vivo and significantly reduced DHT-induced spiggin production at a concentration of 10\u03bcg\/L and 25\u03bcg\/L respectively (P<0.01). Both linuron and vinclozolin induced a significant decrease in DHT-induced spiggin production at a concentration of 100\u03bcg\/L when tested in vivo.

An increasing number of field and laboratory studies 3\nhave investigated the putative links between these disorders and the presence in the 4\nenvironment of anthropogenic chemicals that are able to interfere with the endocrine 5\nfunctions in both humans (Toppari et al., 1996; Sharpe and Skakkebaek, 2003) and wildlife 6\n(Tyler et al., 1998; Vos et al., 2000). 7\nOf particular concern are the chemicals that are able to mimic or block the responses typically 8\ninduced by male sexual hormones, the androgens. Indeed, early studies reported that a number 9\nof environmental contaminants, including chemicals previously described as oestrogenic can 10\nalso act as anti-androgens (Eil and Nisula, 1990; Hose an Guillette, 1995; Kelce et al., 1995; 11\nKelce and Wilson 1997; Sohoni and Sumpter, 1998). In particular, there are data available 12\nsuggesting that several classes of pesticides are able to interfere with androgen functions and 13\ncan cause severe impairment in male sexual development and reproduction (Kelce et al., 14\n1995; Kelce et al., 1997; Makynen et al., 2000; Sohoni et al., 2001). Humans are potentially 15\nexposed to pesticides either directly, as workers in green-houses and in agriculture, or 16\nindirectly, via food consumption. In addition, it is likely that a significant amount of these 17\npesticides and their metabolites reach rivers and estuaries via run-off from farmland thus 18\ncreating localised \u201chot-spots\u201d of chemicals discharges that are potentially toxic to wildlife. 19\nDespite these observations, most studies on aquatic species have focussed on the effects of 20\noestrogenic environmental contaminants (Jobling et al., 1995; Toppari et al., 1996; Sumpter et 21\nal., 1996), while the potential effects of (anti-)androgenic chemicals on sexual development 22\nand maturation in both human and wildlife have been somewhat overlooked. In teleosts as in 23\nmammals, androgens are essential as they control male sexual differentiation and maturation 24\n(Borg, 1994). They act by binding to specific intracellular androgen receptors (AR) to activate 25\nPage 5 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nor repress the expression of specific genes, notably those involved in the development of male 1\nprimary and secondary sexual characters (reviewed by Delvin and Nagahama, 2002). It has 2\nbeen shown that most of the (anti-)androgenic environmental contaminants are able to 3\ninterfere with the androgen signalling pathways by binding directly to the AR and act as 4\nagonists or antagonists (Kelce et al., 1997; Wong et al., 1995).5\nThe screening and classification of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are prerequisites 6\nfor identifying their potential to cause adverse effects on whole organisms. For this reason we 7\nestablished a sensitive in vitro assay for the rapid screening of androgenic and anti-androgenic 8\nchemicals (Jolly et al., 2006). Our method uses a three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus 9\naculeatus) kidney cell primary culture and detects of spiggin production, an androgen induced 10\nprotein. The ability of stickleback kidney cells to produce spiggin in response to androgenic 11\nstimulation has been extensively studied and is well documented. Under natural conditions, 12\nthis protein is only secreted during the breeding season by male sticklebacks that use it as glue 13\nto build a nest (De Ruiter and Mein, 1982; Borg et al., 1993; Jakobsson et al., 1999; Jones et 14\nal., 2001). However, Katsiadaki et al., (2002; 2006) showed that spiggin can be artificially 15\ninduced in female sticklebacks exposed to the androgens 17\u03b1-Methyltestosterone (MT) or 5\u03b1-16\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT) and that this induction was inhibited by flutamide, the synthetic 17\nAR antagonist used in prostate cancer treatment. The expression of this male secondary 18\nsexual character in female has been used as a biomarker for in vivo screening of (anti-19\n)androgenic environmental contaminants (Katsiadaki et al, 2006). In a previous study, we 20\ndemonstrated that similar results can be obtained in vitro: both DHT and the teleost specific 21\nandrogen 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) induced spiggin production in kidney cells primary 22\nculture, a stimulating effect that was significantly inhibited by co-treatment with flutamide23\n(Jolly et al., 2006). 24\nPage 6 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nIn the present study we tested the ability of three selected pesticides, fenitrothion, linuron and 1\nvinclozolin, to inhibit DHT-induced spiggin production in stickleback kidney cell primary 2\nculture. Fenitrothion, an organophosphate insecticide that represents one of the most widely 3\nused classes of pesticides and linuron, a selective urea-based herbicide, are used for crop 4\nprotection. Vinclozolin is a fungicide widely used to control a variety of pathogens on fruit 5\nand vegetables and for crop protection. The pharmacokinetics of endocrine disrupting 6\nchemicals in vivo and their ability to interfere with multiple endocrine functions in a whole 7\norganism emphasises the need to demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms of action 8\nidentified in vitro are also operative in vivo. In order to assess the degree to which results 9\nobtained with kidney cell primary culture are predictive of the sticklebacks\u2019 in vivo response, 10\nwe exposed female adult fish to DHT (5\u00b5g\/L) alone or in combination with a range of 11\nconcentrations of the same test compounds (fenitrothion, linuron, vinclozolin or flutamide).12\nKidney cell primary culture was then used to assess, for the first time in teleosts, the (anti-13\n)androgenic properties of two xenoestrogenic chemicals: nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A 14\n(BPA). It was the first time this procedure has been undertaken in teleosts. NP is one of the 15\nmain degradation product of alkylphenol ethoxylate a class of chemicals used in several 16\nindustrial, agricultural and domestic applications including detergent and pesticides (Jobling 17\net al., 1996). BPA is a major component of consumer products such as polycarbonate plastics, 18\nepoxy resins, and flame-retardants (Hansen et al., 1998; Smeets et al., 1999). Several studies 19\nhave demonstrated the ability of NP and BPA to inhibit androgen-induced process in 20\nmammalian in vitro models (Sohoni and Sumpter, 1998; Lee et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2005). For 21\ncomparison purposes, we also tested in vitro the anti-androgenic of the natural oestrogen 22\noestradiol (E2).23\n24\nPage 7 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\n2. Material and Methods1\n2.1 Fish 2\nAdult sticklebacks were caught by sand-net either in Oslo fjord (Drobak Marine Biological 3\nStation) or were obtained from a supplier (Moore & Moore Carp, Reading, UK) in 2004 and 4\n2005. Sticklebacks from Oslo Fjord were held in 500L tanks supplied with through-flowing 5\nseawater (34\u2030) at 10\u00b0C at the University of Bergen. Specimens from this population were 6\nused in both the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Sticklebacks from the UK supplier were 7\nused for fenitrothion in vivo experiments only, and were kept in 1000L tanks supplied with 8\nconstant flow of Windermere lake (UK) water at ambient temperature (5-12\u00b0C) at the Centre 9\nfor Ecology and Hydrology (CEH, Lancaster UK).  All fish were kept under a short 10\nphotoperiod (8L: 16D). Earlier studies have shown that stickleback kept under this photo-11\nthermal regime remain reproductively quiescent. The fish were fed daily with frozen red 12\nmosquito larvae (Aleds Akvarium AB, Sweden; Tropical Marine Centre, Hertfordshire, UK). 13\nOnly female sticklebacks weighing more than 1g and showing no external signs of parasitic 14\ninfections were used. 15\n16\n2.2 Chemicals 17\nFenitrothion, vinclozolin, linuron, bisphenol A and nonylphenol were purchased from Qmx 18\nLaboratories (Ausburg, UK). DHT, flutamide, and oestradiol were purchased from Sigma-19\nAldrich (Poole, UK). All chemicals were of analytical grade (>99% purity) and chemicals 20\nwith the same batch number were used in all in vitro and in vivo studies. The chemical 21\nstructures of the tested compounds are shown in Figure 1.22\n23\n2.3 In Vitro experiments24\nPriming of female stickleback 25\nPage 8 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nDuring previous validation of the in vitro assay using a primary culture of the stickleback 1\nkidney cells, it was determined that female sticklebacks needed to be primed by DHT 2\nexposure prior to tissue dissection (Jolly et al., 2006). For this, batches of females 3\nsticklebacks were transferred to a 40L glass aquarium under flow-through water conditions 4\nand kept under conditions of LD 12:12 photoperiod and 16\u00b0C. The androgen DHT was 5\napplied to the aquarium by means of a peristaltic pump, giving a final aquarium concentration 6\nof 5\u00b5g\/L. A 10-day exposure to this DHT concentration resulted in an intermediate stage of 7\nkidney hypertrophy in female fish, which is required for culture (Jolly et al., 2006). 8\n9\nCell Dispersion10\nThe protocol for cell culture experiments was previously described in detail (Jolly et al., 11\n2006). Briefly, DHT-primed female sticklebacks were sacrificed by destruction of the brain 12\nand the kidneys quickly dissected and placed in ice-cold culture medium (M199, Gibco, 13\nFrance). For cell dispersion, kidney tissue samples were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15 min, in a 14\nsterile solution of 0.8mg\/ml porcine type II trypsin (Sigma) (prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s saline 15\nphosphate buffer without Ca2+, and Mg2+, with 100U\/ml penicillin, 100\u00b5g\/ml streptomycin, 16\nand 250ng\/ml fungizone) (Gibco). This trypsin solution was then replaced by a solution of 17\ntrypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 1\u00b5g\/ml DNAse (Sigma) in Dulbecco\u2019s buffer (DB) for 10 min. 18\nKidney cells were gently dispersed in DB by repeated passages through a plastic transfer 19\npipette (Falcon). The cell suspension was filtered through nylon mesh (30 \u00b5m pore size), and 20\nharvested by centrifugation at 800 rpm\/min. Cells were then re-suspended in culture medium 21\n(CM): medium 199 with Earle\u2019s salts, sodium bicarbonate, 100U\/ml penicillin, 100\u00b5g\/ml 22\nstreptomycin, and 250ng\/ml Fungizone (Gibco).23\n24\n25\nPage 9 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nCulture system and assay procedure1\nCells were cultured in 96 well tissue culture plates (Costar) coated with Poly-L-Lysine 2\n(Sigma) at a density of 125.000 cells\/well. Plates were incubated at 18\u00b0C under 3% CO2 and 3\nsaturated humidity. After 24h of culture the medium was changed and the treatments started. 4\nTo determine whether any of the test chemicals possessed anti-androgenic activities in the 5\nassay system, the androgen DHT was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 6\n3\u00b5g\/L. The ability of FL, LN, FN, VZ, E2, NP and BPA to inhibit androgen-induced spiggin 7\nexpression was then determined by adding a range of concentrations of the test compounds 8\n[from 2.2pg\/L (10-14M) to 280\u00b5g\/L (10-6M)] to the DHT treated cells. The agonistic activity 9\nof FL, LN, FN, VZ, E2, NP and BPA was also assessed by adding a range of concentrations 10\n(2.2pg\/L to 280\u00b5g\/L) of the test compounds alone.11\nFor each test compound, a stock solution of 10mM was prepared in extra pure 96% ethanol 12\n(EtOH) and stored at -20\u00b0C. For each independent assay, working solutions of the compounds 13\nwere prepared in culture medium on the day of use. Ethanol itself at 0.1% was applied to 14\ncontrol wells (negative control). The effect of 0.1% of ethanol was evaluated by comparison 15\nto non-treated cells (medium only) in each independent experiment.16\n17\nSpiggin extraction and ELISA18\nAfter 48h of incubation, cultures were stopped, the culture medium was removed and the cells 19\nwere washed twice with sterile PBS (Gibco). The spiggin content of the cells was extracted by 20\nadding 100 \u00b5L of a denaturing buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 10mM EDTA, 8M urea, 2% SDS 21\nand 200mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5) to each well, and by sequential freezing and thawing. 22\nThe digests were collected and stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. 23\n24\nPage 10 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\n2.4 In vivo experiments1\nIn vivo experiments were performed at the University of Bergen (Norway). Adult female 2\nsticklebacks were randomly selected from holding tanks. Although we took great care in 3\nselecting only female fish, some misidentifications were present as it is difficult to assign sex 4\nmacroscopically in sticklebacks that are outside their breeding season. For this reason a total 5\nof 20 fish were selected (n=20 fish\/aquarium) to ensure a minimum of 15 female sticklebacks 6\nper treatment. The experimental fish were transferred to 40L glass aquaria supplied with a 7\nconstant flow of seawater (34\u2030; Flow rate of 100ml\/min; FL, VZ, LN) or freshwater (FN) 8\nand kept under constant conditions of LD 12:12 and 15 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. The water in all aquaria was 9\naerated constantly, and temperature, oxygen, pH and salinity monitored every two days. The 10\nfish were fed daily with frozen mosquito larvae, and any accumulated waste products were 11\nsiphoned off every other day. The water in each individual aquarium was constantly renewed 12\n(flow-through system) and chemicals were supplied by means of a microperistaltic pump 13\n(Watson-Marlow, UK) at a flow rate of 100\u00b5l\/min in order to keep them at a constant 14\nconcentration throughout the exposure time.15\n16\nTreatments17\nAll chemicals were dissolved in methanol, although the concentration of methanol in the 18\ntanks never exceeded 0.01%. The effect of 0.01% of methanol itself was evaluated by 19\nincluding a solvent control group in each independent experiment. A range of six 20\nconcentrations of the test compounds were co-administered with 5\u00b5g\/L DHT (equivalent to 21\n1.7.10-8M). The nominal concentrations chosen for FL and LN were 2, 10, 25, 75, 100, and 22\n250\u00b5g\/L; for FN 2, 5, 25, 60, 120, and 240\u00b5g\/L; and for VZ 0.25, 2.5, 25, 100, 250, 500\u00b5g\/L) 23\ndetermined from an initial range-finding trial. In addition, each exposure experiment included 24\nPage 11 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\na control (water only), a positive control (5\u00b5g\/L DHT only), and a test compound control (test 1\ncompound at the highest concentration tested in the absence of DHT).2\nA 21-day exposure was used, consistent with the OECD recommendations in the fish 3\nscreening assays for EDCs (OECD 2004). 4\n5\nOrgan sampling6\nAfter 21 days, the fish from all individual aquaria were terminally anesthetized in MS-222 7\n(100mg\/L), and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After weighing (\u00b10.1g), the kidney was 8\ndissected out, weighed (\u00b10.1mg), and stored at -80\u00b0C for future spiggin analysis.  The sex of 9\neach individual fish was verified macroscopically and only female fish were used in the 10\nanalyses (n=15 to 20).11\n12\nSpiggin extraction and ELISA13\n200\u00b5L of denaturing buffer (as described above) was added to each kidney sample followed 14\nby heating for 30min, at 70\u00b0C in order to achieve complete digestion of the tissue. The digests 15\nwere stored at -20\u00b0C until spiggin analysis. Spiggin level measurements were performed by 16\nELISA (Katsiadaki et al., 2002) at the Cefas Weymouth laboratory. Spiggin protein levels 17\nwere expressed as units of spiggin per gram of body weight.18\n19\n2.5 Analytical chemistry20\nWater Sampling21\nIn order to determine the actual concentration of the test compounds, chemical analysis of the 22\ntank water was performed during in vivo experiments. 1L of Water was collected from each 23\nPage 12 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\ntank every week on days 0, 7, 14 and 21. A volume of methanol equivalent to 0.1% of the 1\nsample volume was added to each sample. The water samples were then filtered through 2\n0,45\u00b5m sterile filters (Acorcap filter units, PN 4482, Pall life science) and SPE cartridges 3\n(WAT023635, Waters Corporation, US) at a flow rate of 15ml\/min. Prior to filtration, the 4\nSPE cartridges were conditioned and equilibrated by gently pushing 5mL of methanol 5\nfollowed by 5mL of distilled water. After filtration, the cartridges and filters were washed 6\nwith 5mL distilled water and immediately stored at -20\u25e6C until analysis. 7\n8\nSample analysis9\nThe cartridges were washed through with 5ml methanol in order to elute the compounds. 10\nDHT was measured by radio-immunoassay (RIA) at the Cefas Weymouth laboratory 11\nemploying the same procedure as for other teleosts steroids (Scott et al., 1984). Briefly, the 12\nmethanol extracts were dried down under a stream of nitrogen gas at 45\u00b0C, reconstituted in 1 13\nml RIA buffer and stored frozen until required for assay. The recovery rate of DHT from the 14\nwater was tested in three separate experiments and found to lie between 60% and 65%. These 15\nexperiments involved \u201cspiking\u201d tank water samples with known amounts of DHT. Thus all 16\nmeasured levels of DHT were multiplied by a factor of 1.6 to correct for losses that occurred17\nduring extraction. Radiolabelled DHT (5\u03b1-Dihydro[1,2,4,5,6,7-3H]testosterone ; product no. 18\nTRK 443) was purchased from GE Healthcare, Amersham, (UK) and kept in ethanol at -19\n20\u00b0C. The standard was stored in a glass container at 4\u00b0C at a concentration of 0.5mg\/ml in 20\nethanol. The DHT antiserum was purchased from Biogenesis (Poole, UK, product no. 21\n32500106).22\nAnalytical chemistry was performed at the Cefas Weymouth laboratory using liquid 23\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for flutamide and linuron, or gas 24\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for vinclozolin and fenitrothion. TBBP-A 25\nPage 13 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\n(tetrabromobisphenol A) was used as an analytical internal standard for the LC-MS analysis 1\nof flutamide and linuron along the same lines as chlorobiphenyl (CB)#155 was deployed as an 2\nanalytical internal standard for the GC-MS analysis of vinclozolin and fenitrothion. Data 3\nanalysis, quantization and confirmation was achieved in Single Ion Monitoring (SIM) mode 4\nusing ions with m\/z of, 109 and 125 for fenitrothion, 105 and 159 for vinclozolin, and 360 and 5\n362 for the internal standard CB#155, and 275.1\u00b10.5, 247.4\u00b11.0, and 543.1\u00b11 for flutamide, 6\nlinuron and TBBP-A respectively.  SIM data were collected in a retention time scheduled 7\nevent.8\n9\n2.6 Statistical analysis10\nThe effect of each compound was tested on two (in vivo) or three (in vitro) independent 11\nexperiments (performed on different fish batches and cell preparations). Figures represent the 12\nresults of one representative in vivo and in vitro experiment. Results are expressed as mean\u00b1 13\nSEM [spiggin units\/body weight (n=15) in vivo or spiggin units\/well (n=6) in vitro]. Data 14\nwere tested for homogeneity of variance and normal distribution, and log-transformed when 15\nrequired. A one-way ANOVA was performed followed by pairwise comparisons between test 16\nand control group using a Tukey\u2019s test.17\n18\nPage 14 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\n3. Results1\n2\n3.1 In Vitro experiments3\n3.1.1 Androgenic effects of dihydrotestosterone, flutamide, linuron, fenitrothion and 4\nvinclozolin on spiggin production.5\nKidney cells treatment with a range of concentrations of DHT [10-14M (3pg\/L) to 10-6M 6\n(300\u00b5g\/L)] alone induced spiggin production in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 2). 7\nA concentration as low as 10-14M (3pg\/L), induced a significant increase in spiggin cell 8\ncontent (x1.4, P<0.05 as compared to control cell). The maximum effect was observed at the 9\nhighest concentration tested; 10-6M (300\u00b5g\/L) DHT (x 1.7, P< 0.001 as compared to control10\ncells). 11\nThe effects of FL, FN, LN or VZ on spiggin cell content in vitro are shown in figure 2. 12\nApplied alone to kidney cells, a range of concentrations of the test compounds [from 10-14M 13\n(2.5pg\/L) to 10-6M (300\u00b5g\/L)] had no significant effect on spiggin cell content.14\nIn all exposures, the solvent alone had no effect on spiggin production as compared to non-15\ntreated cells (medium only) (data not shown).16\n17\n3.1.2 Antiandrogenic effects of flutamide, fenitrothion, linuron and vinclozolin on DHT-18\ninduced spiggin production.19\nThe reference agonist, DHT, was applied at a concentration of 10-8M (3\u00b5g\/L), and led to a 20\nsignificant increase in spiggin production in the positive control cells (from x1.6 to x1.7 21\naccording to the cells batches, P<0.01 as compared to control cells) (figure 3). Flutamide, 22\nFenitrothion, Linuron and Vinclozolin, were able to significantly inhibit the stimulatory effect 23\nof DHT in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in figure 3 (A-D).24\nThe inhibitory effect of flutamide is illustrated in figure 3A. Addition of 10-12M (0.28ng\/L) of 25\nflutamide reduced spiggin production in a significant manner (x0.82, P<0.05 as compared to 26\nPage 15 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\npositive control cells) resulting approximately in a half-maximal inhibition of the DHT 1\nstimulating effect. Spiggin production was further reduced at the higher tested concentrations 2\n[10-10M (28ng\/L), 10-8M (2.8\u00b5g\/L) and 10-6M (280\u00b5g\/L)] (x0.74, and x0.73, P<0.01).3\nKidney cell treatment with 10-12M (0.28ng\/L) fenitrothion significantly inhibited DHT-4\ninduced spiggin production (x, 0.77, P<0.05) and led to a half-maximal inhibition of the DHT 5\nstimulating effect (figure 3B). The highest concentration tested [10-6M L (280\u00b5g\/)] induced a 6\nmaximal inhibition of spiggin production (x0.65, P<0.01 as compared to positive control7\ncells) resulting in a spiggin cell content similar to that of the negative control cells (x 1.06, 8\nNS).9\nLinuron induced a significant inhibition of spiggin production at a concentration of 10-10M 10\n(25ng\/L) (x 0.79, P<0.05 as compared to positive control cells) resulting in approximately 11\nhalf-maximal reduction of the DHT-induced spiggin production (figure 3C). Furthermore, this 12\nchemical caused a complete inhibition of DHT-induced spiggin production at a concentration 13\nof 10-6M (250 \u00b5g\/L) (x0.62, P<0.001) leading to a spiggin cell content identical to that of 14\nnegative control cells (x 1, NS). 15\nVinclozolin induced a decrease in spiggin cell content only at the two highest concentrations 16\ntested, 10-8M (2.8\u00b5g\/L) and 10-6M (280\u00b5g\/L) (figure 3D). However only the highest 17\nconcentration [10-6M (280\u00b5g\/L)] induced a spiggin cell content significantly different from 18\nthat of positive control cells [10-8M: x 0.89, NS; 10-6M: x 0.68, P<0.001] and resulted in a 19\nspiggin cell content not significantly different from that of negative control cells (x 1.17, NS).  20\nResults from the in vitro assays indicated that the four test compounds had the following 21\norder of anti-androgenic potency: fenitrothion \u2265 flutamide \u2265 linuron > vinclozolin.22\n23\n3.1.3 Androgenic effects of DHT, E2, NP and BPA24\nA range of concentrations of DHT [10-14M (3pg\/L) to 10-6M (300\u00b5g\/L)] were applied alone to 25\ncultured kidney cell (figure 4). DHT induced a significant concentration-dependent increase26\nPage 16 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\nin spiggin production in vitro which was already observed at a concentration as low as 10-14M1\n(3pg\/L) (x1.4, P<0.05 as compared to negative control cells). The maximal effect being 2\nobserved at the highest concentration tested, 10-6M (300\u00b5g\/L) DHT (x 1.7, P< 0.001). 3\nThe agonist activity of E2 was tested by adding a range of concentrations of the hormone to 4\nkidney cells [from 10-14M (2.7pg\/L) to 10-6M (270\u00b5g\/L)] (figure 4). None of the 5\nconcentrations tested were able to induce a statistically significant increase in spiggin cell 6\ncontent. Similarly, when tested alone, neither NP nor BPA were able to induce a significant 7\nincrease in spiggin cell content at any of the concentrations tested [from 10-14M (2.2pg\/L and 8\n2.3 pg\/L respectively) to 10-6M (228\u00b5g\/L and 220\u00b5g\/L respectively)].9\n10\n3.1.4 Antiandrogenic effects of E2, NP and BPA11\nIn each individual experiment, kidney cells were treated with 10-8M (3\u00b5g\/L) DHT only 12\n(positive control) or with a combination of DHT (10-8M) and a range of concentrations of the 13\ntest compounds (figure 5). In all experiments, DHT treatment induced significant induction of 14\nspiggin production by kidney cells (from x1.5 to 1.6 according to the cells batches, P< 0.001 15\nas compared to negative control cells).16\nE2 induced a significant but incomplete inhibition of DHT-induced spiggin production only 17\nwhen applied at the highest concentration of 10-6M (272\u00b5g\/L) (x 0.79, P<0.01 as compared to 18\npositive control cells) (figure 5A). On the contrary, we observed that the two highest 19\nconcentrations of NP were able to significantly inhibit DHT-induced spiggin production [10-20\n8M (2.2\u00b5g\/L): x 0.82, P<0.01; 10-6M (220\u00b5g\/L): x0.66, P<0.01 as compared to positive 21\ncontrol cells] (figure 5B). Notably, 10-6M (220\u00b5g\/L) of NP induced a complete inhibition of 22\nDHT-induced spiggin production resulting in spiggin cell content similar to that of the 23\nnegative control cells (x 1.05, NS). BPA was able to induce a significant inhibition of DHT-24\nPage 17 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\ninduced spiggin production in vitro only at the highest dose tested, 10-6M (228\u00b5g\/L) (x 0.83, 1\nP<0.05, as compared to positive control cells) (figure 5C). 2\n3\n3.2 In Vivo experiments4\n3.2.2 Androgenic effects of dihydrotestosterone, flutamide, linuron, fenitrothion and 5\nvinclozolin on spiggin production6\nThe results of in vivo assays for androgenic and anti-androgenic activity of flutamide, 7\nfenitrothion, linuron and vinclozolin are shown in figure 6 (A-D). In all exposures, the vehicle 8\nalone (solvent controls) had no effect on spiggin production, with kidney spiggin levels 9\nremaining at the basal level (101 to 102 spiggin units\/g body weight, NS as compared to water 10\ncontrol) (data not shown).11\nExposure of female sticklebacks to 5\u00b5g\/L DHT alone (positive control) for 21 days induced a 12\nsignificant increase in spiggin production leading to a spiggin kidney content of 104 to 105 13\nunits of spiggin\/g of body weight according to the different experimental fish batches (from 14\nx100 to x1000 as compared to water control group; P<0.001) (figure 6 A-D). 15\nPossible androgenic effects of FL, FN, LN and VZ, were assessed by applying the test 16\ncompounds alone at the highest concentration tested. As shown in figure 6 (A-D), none of the 17\ntest compounds induced spiggin production in female sticklebacks; kidney spiggin remaining 18\nat the basal level (101 to 102 spiggin units\/g body weight): 250\u00b5g\/L FL (x 0.8, NS, as 19\ncompared to water control group); 250\u00b5g\/L LN (x 1.2, NS); 240\u00b5g\/L FN (x 0.44, NS); 20\n500\u00b5g\/L VZ (x 2, NS). 21\n22\n3.2.3 Antiandrogenic effects of flutamide, linuron, fenitrothion and vinclozolin on DHT-23\ninduced spiggin production24\nTo differing degrees, FL, FN, LN, and VZ all inhibited DHT-induced spiggin production in 25\nfemales in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 6A-D). 26\nPage 18 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\nA 50% inhibition of spiggin production occurred approximately at 25\u00b5g\/L FL (figure 6A).1\nHowever, due to high inter-individual variability, this flutamide concentration led to a spiggin 2\nlevel in female stickleback not significantly different from that of the positive control group 3\n(x0.54, NS). Flutamide at 50\u00b5g\/L induced a significant decrease in DHT-induced spiggin 4\nproduction (x0.16, P<0.01 as compared to the positive control group). The highest 5\nconcentration of FL tested, 250\u00b5g\/L, resulted in a complete inhibition of DHT stimulating 6\neffect and spiggin production in females (x0.002, P<0.001 as compared to the positive control 7\ngroup) leading to a spiggin kidney content not significantly different to that of the water8\ncontrol group (x 1.24, NS). 9\nThe effects of a range of concentrations of FN on spiggin production by DHT-stimulated 10\nfemale stickleback are shown in figure 6B. The lowest concentration tested (1.6\u00b5g\/L) induced 11\napproximately 50% inhibition of DHT-induced spiggin production (x 0.46, NS as compared 12\nto positive control group). At that FN concentration some female fish were highly responsive 13\nwhile others produced spiggin. FN at 10\u00b5g\/L induced a significant decrease in spiggin kidney 14\ncontent (x0.29, P<0.01, as compared to positive control group). We observed a complete 15\ninhibition of spiggin production at the highest concentration tested (240\u00b5g\/L) (x 0.002, 16\nP<0.001 as compared to positive control group; x 1.11, NS as compared to the water control 17\ngroup). LN was able, significantly inhibit spiggin production content in fish exposed to DHT 18\nonly at the two highest concentrations tested, 100\u00b5g\/L and 250\u00b5g\/L (x 0.4 and x 0.08, 19\nrespectively, P<0.05; as compared to the positive control group) (figure 6C). None of the LN 20\nconcentrations tested induced complete inhibition of androgen-induced spiggin production in 21\nvivo. Exposure of the fish to 100\u00b5g\/L of VZ induced a significant inhibition of DHT-induced 22\nspiggin production in females (x 0.016, P<0.001 as compared to the positive control group). 23\nInhibition of spiggin production was complete at the two highest VZ concentrations tested, 24\nnamely 250 and 500\u00b5g\/L (x0.0025 and x 0.0016 respectively, P<0.001 as compared to 25\nPage 19 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n19\npositive control group) leading to spiggin kidney content similar to that of the water control 1\ngroup (x 1.4, NS). 2\nResults from the in vivo assays indicated that the four test compounds had the following order 3\nof anti-androgenic potency: fenitrothion > flutamide \u2265 vinclozolin > linuron.4\n5\n3.2.4 Water Chemistry6\nMean measured concentrations for chemicals (DHT, flutamide, fenitrothion, linuron and 7\nvinclozolin) are presented in Table 1 (A-D). Measured concentrations of DHT as a proportion 8\nof nominal concentrations (percentage of recovery) ranged from 59.5% to 100%. 9\nMean measured levels of test compounds were below the nominal values: fenitrothion (from 10\n64.7% to 74%), linuron (from 30.3% to 77%), flutamide (from 27.5% to 44.7%) and lower 11\nrecovery rates for vinclozolin (from 6% to 11.4%).12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\nPage 20 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n20\nDiscussion 1\nComparison in vivo \/ in vitro data2\nThe aim of this work was, first, to assess whether kidney cell primary culture test is an 3\naccurate predictor of in vivo effects of EDCs. We observed that all the compounds tested were 4\nable to inhibit DHT-induced spiggin production in a concentration-dependent manner in both 5\nin vivo (FN>FL\u2265VZ>LN) and in vitro (FN\u2265FL\u2265LN>VZ) assays. This observation 6\ndemonstrates that the mechanisms leading to spiggin production by androgens and inhibition 7\nby anti-androgens in vivo are conserved in vitro. Previous studies demonstrated that both 8\nkidney hypertrophy and spiggin production (Borg et al, 1993; Jakobsson et al., 1999) and 9\nspiggin mRNA expression (Olsson et al., 2005) in vivo are androgen dependent processes. In 10\naddition, we previously reported that spiggin induction by the teleost specific androgen, 11-11\nketotestosterone in vitro can be inhibited by the specific androgen receptor antagonist 12\nflutamide (Jolly et al., 2006). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that spiggin 13\nproduction by kidney cells is induced via a traditional AR-mediated pathway. Kidney cell 14\nprimary cultures therefore appear to be a reliable and biologically relevant screening tool to 15\npredict the ability of environmental contaminants to interfere with androgen-induced 16\nsignalling pathways. Our present study confirms that FL as well as FN, VZ, LN, BPA and NP 17\nare able to exert their anti-androgenic activity and block spiggin production via direct 18\ninteraction with kidney cell physiological pathways. 19\nSeveral rapid and cost effective in vitro bioassays have been developed for the screening of 20\nenvironmental (anti-)androgens. These cellular models are notably based either on 21\nmammalian cell lines (Paris et al., 2002; T\u00e9rouanne et al., 2000) or yeast strain (Sohoni and 22\nSumpter, 1998; Sanseverino et al., 2009) transfected with an androgen receptor. The overall 23\nsensitivity of these assays is very good and protocols used are relatively standardized and 24\nminiaturised. However cell transfection with receptor-reporter system may introduce 25\nPage 21 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n21\nvariations that can lead to contradictory observations according to the bioassays selected. In 1\naddition, other parameters of the cellular environment, such as the presence of co-activators or 2\nco-repressors of AR transactivation, can significantly influence the (anti-)androgenic 3\npotencies of both natural hormones and xenobiotics (Simon and Mueller, 2006). For these 4\nreasons extrapolation from data obtained in heterologous\/artificial models to responses 5\nelicited in vivo appears difficult. As natural targets of steroid hormones, stickleback kidney 6\ncells constitute a particularly powerful model to further investigate the molecular and cellular 7\nmechanisms by which man-made environmental contaminants exert their (anti-)androgenic 8\neffects. 9\nIn general, rapid and cost-effective in vitro assays are particularly suitable for primary 10\nscreening experiments. Indeed, as compared to in vivo studies, in vitro systems use fewer11\nexperimental fish and they permit a significant reduction in the amount of harmful chemicals 12\nneeding to be used. For example in the present study approximately 600 fish were sacrificed 13\nto test the anti-androgenic properties of six chemicals in vivo (five concentrations), while 50 14\nfish only were needed to screen the same number of compounds in vitro (fives 15\nconcentrations). This is of paramount importance in view of the thousand of man-made 16\nchemicals that are produced and released in the environment every year. Of particular concern 17\nare those chemicals possessing structural similarities to pharmaceutical anti-androgen 18\nflutamide, i.e. a phenol-ring (see figure 1), which appears to be a common feature of the 19\nnatural or man-made compounds that are able to bind steroid hormone receptors. Based on 20\nthis observation one can predict that a significant number of other chemicals, such as the 21\ninsecticide parathion (Sohoni et al., 2001), or the herbicide diuron (Bauer et al., 1998) could 22\npotentially act as (anti-)androgens. 23\nThe complexity of endocrine function in animals makes it difficult to rely on in vitro data 24\nalone to predict the endocrine disrupting properties of man-made chemicals in general. The 25\nPage 22 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n22\nuse of the stickleback as model organism allows the development of comparative in vivo\/in 1\nvitro studies for the first time in teleosts. This is particularly important to further understand 2\ntransmission of the adverse effects that occur at the molecular and cellular levels at the 3\norganism and population level.4\nAnalytical chemistry data showed that only low percentages of the nominal concentrations of 5\nflutamide and vinclozolin could be measured in the water (Table 1A and 1D). The reasons for 6\nsuch low recovery rates have not been clarified yet. However, comparable results were 7\nreported by Allen and co-workers (2008) in a stickleback intercalibrating in vivo study. Taken 8\ntogether these observations suggest that the true lowest observed effects values in the 9\nstickleback are potentially lower than those reported so far.  10\n11\nComparison of stickleback versus mammalian models12\nSeveral studies reported that teleosts unlike mammals possess two AR (alpha and beta) 13\nsubtypes that differ in their binding affinities for endogenous hormones and tissue distribution 14\n(Takeo and Yamashita, 1999; Todo et al, 1999; Ikeuchi et al, 1999). In the stickleback, an 15\nandrogen receptor (AR\u03b2) has been cloned from kidney mRNA and the molecular structure of 16\nthe two splicing variants has been characterized (termed AR\uf0621 and AR\uf0622) (Olsson et al, 17\n2005). These two variants show high similarities with the mammalian androgen receptor. 18\nConsistent with this finding we report a clear correlation between mammalian and stickleback 19\nin vivo and in vitro response to flutamide, fenitrothion, linuron and vinclozolin (summarized 20\nin Table 2A and 2B). 21\nFor example, Sohoni et al. (2001) showed that fenitrothion is able to antagonize the 22\nandrogenic effect of DHT in recombinant yeast expressing the human receptor. Similarly, 23\nTamura and co-workers (2001) reported that the potency of fenitrothion as a competitive AR 24\nantagonist was comparable to that of flutamide in human cell line transfected with the human 25\nPage 23 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n23\nAR as well as in the Hershberger assay. In the present study, fenitrothion was the most 1\nefficient chemical at inhibiting DHT-induced spiggin synthesis in vivo and appeared to 2\npossess a potency comparable to that of flutamide in vitro. Indeed, both chemicals induced a 3\nsignificant decrease in spiggin cell content at a concentration as low as 10-12M (2.8ng\/L). We 4\nobserved that in vivo fenitrothion significantly inhibited spiggin production at a nominal 5\nconcentration as low as 10\u00b5g\/L while flutamide and linuron were effective at 25\u00b5g\/L and 6\n100\u00b5g\/L respectively. The ability of linuron to inhibit the binding of androgens to rat prostatic 7\nAR was reported in early competitive receptor binding studies (Cook et al., 1993; Bauer et 8\nal., 1998). Later Lambright et al. (2000) showed that linuron also has affinity for the human 9\nAR, using a transfected COS cell line assay, and that it induces a decrease in the weight of 10\nDHT-dependent tissues in the Hershberger assay.  McIntyre et al, (2000) also observed that in 11\nutero exposure to linuron impairs androgen-mediated reproductive development in male rat. 12\nIn the same study, the authors showed that in hepatoma cell line transfected with human AR 13\nlinuron competitively antagonize AR DHT-induced transcriptional activity in a concentration-14\ndependent manner. In the present study, linuron inhibited DHT-induced spiggin production in 15\nvivo and in vitro at a concentration of 100\u00b5g\/L (nominal concentration) and 10-10M (25ng\/L),16\nrespectively. Linuron appeared to be the least potent of the chemicals tested in vivo while in 17\nvitro it appeared more potent than vinclozolin which induced a significant decrease in spiggin 18\nproduction only at the highest concentration tested (10-6M or 280\u00b5g\/L). In vivo, 100\u00b5g\/L of 19\nvinclozolin (nominal concentration) proved to be sufficient to inhibit spiggin production in 20\nDHT-treated female sticklebacks. Gray and co-workers, (1994) reported for the first time the 21\nability of this pesticide to inhibit sexual differentiation in an anti-androgenic manner in male 22\nrats. 23\nIt has been demonstrated that vinclozolin itself is a weak AR antagonist and that its anti-24\nandrogenic effects is mediated mainly via its two main degradation products, M1 and M2 25\nPage 24 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n24\n(Kelce et al., 1994). Wong et al., (1995) demonstrated that M1 and M2, are potent AR 1\nantagonists that are able to inhibit AR binding to androgen response element (ARE) sequence, 2\nthus inhibiting the transcription of AR-dependent genes in human cell line transfected with a 3\nrecombinant human AR. In the present study, vinclozolin appeared as a weak anti-androgen 4\nin vitro. 5\n6\nComparison of stickleback versus other teleost models7\nIn addition to the stickleback, a number of teleosts are now promoted as model species in 8\nlaboratory experiments to assess the adverse effect of man-made EDCs on aquatic wildlife. 9\nWe observed a good correlation between our data and some of the results reported in the 10\nliterature. For example exposure of juvenile guppies to vinclozolin or flutamide resulted in a 11\nreduction in the expression of male secondary sex characters, a reduced sperm count and 12\nfinally skewed sex ratio towards female (Bayley et al., 2002) and high vinclozolin 13\nconcentration (2500\u03bcg\/L) affected spermatogenesis in male Japanese medaka (Oryzias 14\nlatipes) (Kiparissis et al., 2003). Panter and co-workers (2003 and 2004) reported that both 15\nflutamide and vinclozolin are able to block androgen induced processes in adult fish using a 16\nfathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) non-spawning assay. On the contrary, Makynen and 17\ncolleagues (2000) reported that fathead minnow exposed to high concentrations of vinclozolin 18\n(90-1200\u00b5g\/L) for 34 days through early embryonic and larval life stages developed normally 19\nin terms of growth and sexual differentiation. The authors also investigated through 20\ncompetitive radioligand binding experiments the affinity of vinclozolin and its metabolites for 21\nthe fathead minnow androgen receptor and observed that neither vinclozolin nor M1 or M2 22\ncould compete for testosterone binding sites. Similarly, Wells and Van der Kraak (2000) 23\nreported that neither flutamide nor vinclozolin and its metabolistes possess affinity to ARs 24\nfrom the goldfish (Crassius auratus) or the rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). 25\nPage 25 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n25\nIt is likely that some of the discrepancies we report above and which are summarized in Table 1\n2A and 2B, result from differences in the methodologies used to assess the endocrine activity2\nof the test chemicals. However, the existence of significant differences in the regulation of the 3\nendocrine function among teleosts such as the occurrence of different AR subtypes with 4\ndifferent affinities for both endogenous hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds5\ncannot be ruled out. These differences should be accounted for especially when promoting 6\nnew bio-indicator species. Our results suggest that the stickleback is potentially a suitable 7\nmodel to study the impact of EDCs on androgen mediated pathways in humans.8\n9\nOestrogens act as anti-androgens in stickleback kidney cell primary culture 10\nAfter validation of our in vitro model with known anti-androgens we applied our assay to the 11\nscreening of the natural steroid, E2 and two estrogenic environmental chemicals (NP and 12\nBPA) that are able to interfere with the functioning of AR in mammals (Sohoni and Sumpter, 13\n1998; Lee et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2005). Inhibition of DHT-induced spiggin production in 14\nvitro was observed at the highest concentrations tested only for all the three chemicals [i.e. E2: 15\n10-6M (270\u00b5g\/L); NP: 10-8 and 10-6M (2.2 and 220\u00b5g\/L); BPA: 10-8 and 10-6M (2.3 and 16\n230\u00b5g\/L)]. Oguro (1957) reported for the first time the ability of E2 to induce a regression of 17\nkidney hypertrophy in the stickleback in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability 18\nof E2 to exert its anti-androgenic effect via direct interaction with kidney cells. The molecular 19\nmechanisms by which E2 is able to interfere with spiggin production in vitro remain to be 20\nidentified. Gaido et al., (1997) showed E2 to be about 1\/30\nth the potency of DHT to bind the 21\nhuman AR, while Olsson and co-workers (2005) reported that E2 is able to down regulate the 22\nexpression of AR mRNA in the stickleback in vivo. These data suggest that E2 is able to exert 23\nits anti-androgenic effect by interfering directly with AR expression and\/or activity. However 24\nthe steroid response in animals is highly complex and can include cross talk among steroids 25\nPage 26 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n26\nand steroids receptors. Therefore we cannot exclude that E2 anti-androgenic effects involve 1\nreceptors other than the AR. 2\nSimilarly, for the first time in teleosts, we report the anti-androgenic properties of two 3\noestrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds: BPA and NP. To our knowledge, the anti-4\nandrogenic properties of NP and BPA have been reported only in a recombinant in vitro5\nsystem, using assays based on mammalian cell lines or yeast strain transfected with 6\nmammalian AR (Sohoni and Sumpter, 1998; Lee et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2005). Notably, 7\nSohoni and Sumpter (1998) reported that BPA is able to antagonise androgens at 8\nconcentrations above 10-6M (228\u00b5g\/L) in a yeast-based assay transfected with the human AR. 9\nLater, Lee et al., (2003) showed that BPA and NP have anti-androgenic activity at multiple 10\nsteps of mouse AR activation and function in vitro. Both compounds were able to inhibit AR 11\nandrogen binding, AR nuclear import and its subsequent trans-activation in a concentration-12\ndependent manner. As for E2, the molecular mechanisms involved in inhibition of androgen-13\ninduced spiggin production by BPA and NP in vitro remain to be clarified. 14\nWe have previously reported the anti-androgenic effect of ethinyl-oestradiol in an identical in 15\nvivo system (Katsiadaki et al., 2006) and we are currently analysing the data from in vivo 16\nexposures employing BPA, NP and E2. Preliminary data suggest that the anti-androgenic 17\neffect of E2 is apparent at lower concentrations than those detected by our in vitro system. 18\nTherefore our future in vivo\/in vitro studies will aim at further deciphering the anti-19\nandrogenic properties and the mechanism of action of xenoestrogens in the stickleback. 20\n21\nConclusion22\nThe present study offers further validation of the in vitro kidney cell assay we have 23\ndeveloped. Most importantly, we present here the first attempt to develop an integrated in 24\nvivo\/in vitro screening strategy for assessing the effects of (anti-)androgenic environmental 25\nPage 27 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n27\ncontaminants. These combined in vivo\/in vitro assays are particularly needed to further 1\nunderstand the transmission at the organism and population level of adverse effects that occur 2\nat the molecular and cellular levels. In particular future studies will investigate the molecular 3\nmechanisms involved in inhibition of spiggin production by vinclozolin, linuron, fenitrothion, 4\nbisphenol A, nonylphenol and oestradiol in the three-spined stickleback. 5\n6\nAcknowledgments 7\nThis project was funded by the European project EDEN, a bilateral Norway\u2013France 8\ncooperation program (Aurora Program 10016-UC) and DEFRA (Department for 9\nEnvironment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs). 10\nThe authors wish to thank Elinor Bartle for checking and correcting the language of this 11\nmanuscript.12\n13\nPage 28 of 50\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n28\nReferences1\n2\nAllen, Y.T., Katsiadaki, I., Pottinger, T.G., Jolly, C., Matthiessen, P., Mayer, I., Smith, A., 3\nScott, A.P., Eccles, P., Sanders, M.B.,.
