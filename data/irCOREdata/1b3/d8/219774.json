Callon\u2019s idea was that \u201ceconomics \ndoes not describe an existing external \u2018economy\u2019, but brings that economy into being: \neconomics performs the economy, creating the phenomena it describes\u201d (MacKenzie & Millo, \n2003, p.108). This idea is now recognized by many authors as one of the major contributions \nto economic sociology (see, e.g., Barry & Slater, 2002; Holm, 2007; MacKenzie & Millo, \n2003; MacKenzie, 2004; MacKenzie, 2007) and has been accompanied by vivid debates  \nacross the social sciences about the actual influence of economics and economists over \neconomic practices (e.g. Miller, 2000; Callon, 2005; Ferraro, Pfeffer and Sutton, 2005; \nGhoshal, 2005; MacKenzie, Muniesa & Siu, 2007; Callon, 2007) and more generally over \nsociety and political processes (see, e.g., Bazerman & Malhotra, 2006; Fourcade, 2001, 2006). \nBut when we remember to take the \u201ccultural\u201d dimension into consideration\u2014that is: when we \nmove beyond economic sociology to the broader intellectual realm of social sciences and \nhumanities at large\u2014 we are also reminded that Callon was not the first scholar to develop an \ninterest in performativity as a way to address issues whose importance goes well beyond pure \nlanguage processes. Since Austin outlined the philosophical proposition that speech is not \nprimarily or exclusively \u2018constative\u2019, that is, it does not just \u2018state\u2019 facts but, in certain \nfelicitous conditions, \u2018acts\u2019 or \u2018performs\u2019 certain realities, the idea of performativity has  \nengaged theorists within the political and social sciences, philosophy and gender theory \nnotably including Pierre Bourdieu (1982), Jacques Derrida, (1991) and of course Judith Butler \n(1990, 1993, 1997).  \nButler\u2019s initial and decisive intervention was to deploy a retooled version of performativity to \ncounter the approaches to gender adopted within feminist and social theory. In Butler\u2019s hands, \na Foucauldian inflected and fully elaborated account of performativity described sex and \ngender as neither essences nor pure constructions but as the contingent outcomes of the \nmanner in which they are performed and reiterated. The voracious appetite which greeted \nButler\u2019s formulation is in part a consequence of how well she demonstrated the difference that \nmight be made by considering an object performatively. A huge literature has followed in her \nwake stretching from the rare distinction of the intellectual fanzine Judy to ongoing efforts to \napply, refine and dispute performative perspectives across a vast range of political objects and \nproblems. \nGiven the range and extent of this impact three puzzling and challenging questions for \neconomic sociology arise: why did it take so much longer in this field, as compared to others, \nfor performativity to be adopted as a way of shedding new light on their subject matter? \nWhat, if any, relevance does the framework have at a time of acute global financial and \npolitical crises? Finally, what is really at stake in the debate and is a concern with \nperformativity a useful tool or a mere distraction when it comes to the \u2018big\u2019 questions about \neconomics and politics? ,  \nOf course, the development of intellectual programs is never independent of the political, \neconomic, cultural and moral concerns which surround them and we have to praise the \noutsiders, free riders and \u201chybridizers\u201d like Callon1 for shaking conventional wisdom and \nbringing fresh ideas that without them would probably take a longer time to arise (assuming \nthey ever do!). But we would like to complement this view with a further hypothesis (which \nactually makes Callon\u2019s contribution all the more meaningful). This hypothesis is as follows: : \nthe contrast between the relative novelty of performativity in economic sociology, and its long \nand rich use elsewhere in the academy, may well rely on a much older divide between two \nopposite worlds: the world of the economy on the one hand (seen as a system of things where \nlanguage is of secondary importance), and the world of politics on the other hand (thought as \na collective of words where things are often forgotten). \nThis great divide is the result of the historical struggle of economics, as a discipline, to build \nand posit itself as a distinct science and as an alternative to politics. As Albert Hirschman \n(2002) brilliantly showed, Adam Smith proposed his theory of the invisible hand of the \nmarket (economics) as a way to get rid of the Ancien Regime (politics). By means of the \nmarket mechanism, social order would no longer depend on forceful control through human \ninstitutions like religion or government, but rather on the \u2018natural-like\u2019 adjustment of private \n                                                            \n1. Michel Callon\u2019s first career was not in economic sociology but in the sociology of science. \nwants, goods and money. More precisely, the aim was to replace \u2018spiritual civil war\u2019 with \n\u2018worldly civil peace\u2019 by channelling the potential disorder of human passions into the pursuit \nof market interests (cf Saunders 1997, p. 4; du Gay, 2005 and this issue). The dangerous \nhuman interactions that had led to decades of bloody civil war across Europe were to be \ndiverted instead towards material entities and converted into the single passion that serves as a \ndomesticated equivalent of all the others: the pursuit of self-interest. \nSince that time, economics has attempted first to connect human exchanges into economic \nprocesses and second to attach these processes to laws defined as natural rather than as \npolitical, or to the force of matters rather than to the shams of language\u2014interest being to the \neconomic world what gravity is to the Newtonian one. In other words, from its very origin, \neconomics worked hard to define itself as a purely constative science that describes the \neconomy (see the example of the physiocrats in Giraudeau\u2019s contribution, this issue). The \neconomy is supposed to exist and function \u201cout there\u201d, according to some physical \u201cpositive\u201d \nmechanisms, in contrast to the more \u201cspeech like\u201d and relativistic workings of politics. From \nDurkheim to Granovetter, economic sociologists have endlessly tried to counter  the \neconomists\u2019 vision by questioning the \u201cunrealistic\u201d character of their hypothesis and the \n\u201cfalseness\u201d of their descriptions. But the paradox is that in limiting the discussion to the \nconstative dimension of economic theories, economic sociology, instead of producing a \nconvincing critique, forgot to explore how economies are shaped by economics. Thus \neconomic sociology reinforced the radical autonomy of the discipline it meant to correct.  \n This offers some explanation of why it took so long for economic sociologists to explore the \nperformative character of economics beyond its constative claims. If classical economics and \nsociology oppose each other about the \u201cright\u201d description of the world\u2014each one of them \ncould not but represent one of the two opposite sides of the great divide between nature and \nculture, economics and politics\u2014they both conceived their respective tasks as \u201cdescribing\u201d \nthe world at stake rather than \u201cmaking\u201d it through this very description\u2014hence their \ndeadlocked opposition. Of course, such a modernist opposition between two separate worlds, \ncan be understood, as Latour (1993) explains as the very condition for their clandestine \nhybridization. In this respect, it is no coincidence that it is from Latour\u2019s colleague Michel \nCallon and their shared perspective of STS scholarship that the unveiling of the performative \ncharacter of economics came. Focusing on the performativity of economics involves studying \nthe hybridization between the political language of economics on the one hand, and the \nworking of economic devices, processes and hard facts on the other. Such a study helps to go \nbeyond the useless criticism of the constative character of economics, and more importantly \nto grasp the crucial point that economic things are held stable and meaningful by economic \nwords. This approach gives to the Polanyian intuition\u2014that economics is a political \ninstitution and a social project (Polanyi, 2001)\u2014the theoretical scheme it was lacking. As \nsoon as the economy becomes a matter of performative language (and politics a matter of \nperformed things\u2014a res-publica [Latour, 2005]), the great divide between economics and \npolitics, economy and society is revealed as the partial and provisional outcome of a long \nhistorical project of separation. More concisely, politics and economies are not so much \nseparate as they are made separate. . \nThis special issue aims to address this by focusing on the relationships between economics \nand politics as two different forms of performative enunciations that compete and combine \nwith each other. It is worth mentioning that this project began with a conference in Toulouse \non 23-25 October 2008.2. The idea of the conference was to use performativity as a way of \nreconnecting economics and politics. To fulfil this project, we attempted to bring together \nauthors who were concerned with either the concept of performativity in social and political \nsciences or a political perspective on markets and\/or economics. Thanks to an extraordinary \ncombination of circumstances, it was a peculiarly timely moment. On the one hand, the \nfinancial turmoil that had begun just one month earlier suggested that the performative \nrelationship between economics and the economy was somewhat broken, at least temporarily, \npotentially opening up a new space for state intervention. On the other hand Barack Obama, \nwho at that time was in the final steps of his campaign, stressed the amount of political effort \nthat had been required throughout history, and would be required again, to perform political \nideals:  \n\u201cThe answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution, he said. (\u2026) \nAnd yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide \nmen and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the \nUnited States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were \nwilling to do their part \u2013through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a \n                                                            \n2. This event was co-organized by the editors of this special issue along with Jean-Pascal Gond and Jacques \nIgalens, and sponsored by: CERTOP (laboratory, University Toulouse II), CNRS (public agency); CRESC \n(Manchester University and the Open University), LIRHE (laboratory, University Toulouse I), MSH-Toulouse, \nR\u00e9gion Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Scientific Council of Toulouse II University. We warmly thank all these contributors; \nwithout them this issue would probably not exist. \ncivil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk\u2013 to narrow that gap between the \npromise of our ideals and the reality of their time\u201d (Obama\u2019s Philadelphia speech on race, \nMarch 18th, 2008).  \nThe time seemed propitious for reconnecting economics and politics around performativity, \nbut also for rethinking at least some aspects of performativity as it was first conceived in \neconomic sociology. More precisely, an approach to performativity as politics could move the \ndebates around the performativity of economics beyond their present location in economic \nsociology, and consequently contribute to: (1) developing a more robust and general theory of \nperformativity; (2) reviewing the politics of performativity to help reinforce political analyses \nof markets and market-making; and (3) cross-fertilizing economic sociology with other fields \nof sociology.  \nIt is important to stress that up to now the literature has indicated rather than finally \ndemonstrated the performative character of economics. The idea of the performativity \nprogram in economic sociology was not to transform this discipline into some kind of \nsociolinguistics, but rather to shed new light on the economy. But this has sometimes \ninvolved taking performativity as an axiom rather than as an object. If the purpose of the \nperformativity project in economic sociology was to seize economics in its pragmatic \ndimension, and study what it does and says at the same time this does not exhaust the need to \nreview and reappraise the assumptions inherent with the project itself. In moving beyond the \neconomic field and contrasting economic and political processes, the contributions to this \nspecial issue  are both an effort to extend performative analyses and an effort to go backward \nand question what it is that performativity does as a project and as an analytical tool.  \nWith that aim in mind the issue begins with an invited symposium which, in featuring Judith \nButler, Michel Callon, Paul du Gay and Christian Licoppe, is distinguished by bringing the \ntwo most important instigators and innovators within the performativity project into \nconversation with scholars whose perspective on the concept is taken from somewhat more of \na distance. In their different ways all four share a determination, which sometimes borders on \nthe fearless, to consider neglected questions about performativity, and its failures, afresh. In \nPerformative Agency Butler invokes J.L.Austin\u2019s distinction between illocutionary \nperformatives, which pronounce a reality, and perlocutionary performatives which in \nfelicitous conditions may make certain things happen, to argue that as the really interesting \nquestions in economic performativity arise in the perlocutionary form, failure and breakdown \nare in certain respects, constitutive of performativity. For Butler, this restricts the reach of \neconomic performativity and raises troublesome questions about the scope for politics, \npolitical subjectivity and dialogue, if we can only consider \u2018how certain things happen\u2019 or \n\u2018how we are to join in the making of what is already underway\u2019 (ppp). In his response, Michel \nCallon shares Butler\u2019s preoccupation with misfires and failures and the attendant view that \nperlocution is the most fundamental and most general form of economic performative. But for \nCallon the charge that the performativity thesis has the effect of depoliticising the economy \noverlooks the ways in which, as a programme of work, performativity makes reflecting on the \neconomy\/politics nexus central. In recognising first the diversity of forms of economic \norganisation and, more especially, the relationship between plural theoretical frameworks and \ndistinct market models and second in analysing how the demarcation, or bifurcation, between \nthese questions that need to be treated \u2018politically\u2019 and those that can be left to the market, is \nmade, economic performativity is always also political.  \nFor Paul du Gay the question is not so much one of locating or defending the politics within \nthe performativity programme as interrogating the underpinning ideas about politics and \npolitical agency which inform Butler\u2019s, and to some extent, Callon\u2019s thinking. One of the \ndifficulties aroused by defining performative failure theoretically, he argues, lies in the \nconcomitant subordination of contingent empirical matters to higher philosophical truths. But \ndescribing on what, exactly, \u2018it all depends\u2019, du Gay insists is necessary element of a practical \nrather than philosophical political engagement. The dangers he detects of a politics founded \non higher philosophical truths, resonate with those which motivated early pragmatist \nphilosopher\u2019s disavowal of philosophical and scientific certitudes because of their historical \nprovisionality and partiality but also, importantly, because of their failure to prevent the \ndestruction of the civil war (cf. Menand, 2001). \nChristian Licoppe\u2019s contribution continues the debate about politics, practice and the \nsignificance of the empirical but with something of a change of tack. Performatives, Licoppe \nagrees with Butler, can indeed fail or elicit surprising responses but there is a particular edge \nto be gained from the emphasis within socio-technical accounts on what not only words, but \nthings, or more precisely words in combination with things, can do. Using the example of a \ndistributed video judicial hearing Licoppe shows how technologies can contribute to the ways \nin which a performative fails. In doing so he also exposes the role of improvisation, \nnegotiation and informal organisation across socio-technical networks in the ongoing making \nof judicial politics. It is through the development of an \u2018anthropology of communication \ntechnologies in action\u2019 that the consequence of the links between technologies and utterances \nbecome empirically observable. \nIf the symposium marks out the stakes of the debate theoretically, the papers in the main \nsection continue to explore how these stakes play in empirical settings. In their different ways, \nall seven of the papers address economy and politics as a nexus of relationships, connections, \nand overlaps between the political language of economics and the material working of \neconomic and market devices, processes and practices. The issue begins with three papers \nwhich, alongside their other concerns, explore how the separation between economics and \npolitics, economy and society was settled in three distinct historical and geographical \ncontexts.  \nWorking backwards in time the issue begins with Timothy Mitchell\u2019s account of the ways in \nwhich the 1973 oil crisis offers a means to extend the reach of the methods associated with \nthe performativity project to investigate attempts in the global south to reorganize local \nmaterial and political worlds according to the laws of the market. Attention to this political \nengineering of markets, Mitchell shows, draws attention both to some of the unexpected \noutcomes produced by the properties of goods and to the experimental, calculative techniques \non which the process actually depends. Underpinning his account is a sense of the ways in \nwhich certain ideas, forces, or movements come, for a time, to seem global, to possess a \ntranslocal logic or apparent irresistibility, which nevertheless fails to entirely prevent \nunanticipated challenges. Despite the work that went into making the oil crisis appear like a \ntext-book example of the natural law of supply and demand the events of 1973-74 exceeded \nand overflowed the attempts to contain them as a matter of market forces. Mitchell\u2019s account \ncogently demonstrates the partial and contingent processes involved in the assembling and \ndefinition of a field of political concern marked for government intervention. Despite - or \nperhaps because of- the effort involved in fixing the terms of the debate, the debate would \nbubble over, producing unanticipated concerns with other matters including the environment, \noverconsumption etc. \nThe labour involved in marking and maintaining divisions between economic and political \nconcerns is also a theme in Liz McFall\u2019s account of the emergence of commercial industrial \nassurance in nineteenth century Britain as the preferred technique of financial planning for the \npoor. Charting the progress of the industry over more than a century, McFall argues, exposes \nthe inherently political nature of the process by which economic objects and persons are \nconstituted. Political theorising, government and law were not just close to the commercial \nbusiness they were the unsteady means through which it emerged, evolved and ultimately \nended. Close pragmatic description, of the type championed by the performativity project, \nMcFall maintains, offers the best chance of developing an informed grasp of these shifting \npractical entanglements and their failures.  \nMoving further back in time to late eighteenth century France, Martin Giraudeau\u2019s account of \nthe efforts of Du Pont de Nemours, the economist, statesman, entrepreneur and indirect \nfounder of the still thriving Du Pont company, to perform physiocracy also reveals the plural \nconnections and overlaps between economic doctrines and political practices. For Giraudeau \nhowever Du Pont\u2019s ultimate failure in this endeavour demonstrates the limits of political \nengineering of markets as his over-reliance on political ties in the end undermined his \ncapacity to materialise a physiocratic economic experiment. If some elements of the \nphysiocratic doctrine, including free-trade, were performed in early modern France, it was \ntherefore not through the deliberate political action of a limited number of individual subjects, \nbut in a slower, partial and diffuse way. \nMitchell, McFall and Giraudeau\u2019s accounts are concerned with how the theoretical separation \nbetween politics and the economy has played out historically while addressing the ways in \nwhich, in practice, the devices, processes and practices of markets and economies are deeply \nimbued with the political language of economics. This simultaneous separation and \nhybridization is never, in any context, entire and complete for all time, but the difficulties \nassociated with it reach a particular peak in the contexts of bodies and borders addressed in \nnext two articles. Phillipe Steiner\u2019s discussion of the commerce in organ transplantation \nimmediately throws intro relief the controversies aroused by marking and shifting political \nand economic boundaries especially those which touch directly upon the human body. His \naccount focuses on the Harvard economist Alvin E. Roth\u2019s development of matching software \ndesigned to circumvent the market in view of the strong feelings of repugnance aroused by a \ncommercial market in human body parts. For Steiner the case demonstrates how a socio-\neconomic performative action operates in non-market commerce and it is precisely the form \nof engineering and institutional design that may be required if sociologists are to engage in \nbuilding purposively the social world. \nSarah Green\u2019s article addresses boundaries of a different kind in an analysis of the way \nborders are performed as conceptual entities. Green casts a fresh perspective on the matter of \nseparation by drawing attention to the ways in borders are always also about relations. The \nborder as a divide as such cannot be taken for granted in understanding the difference borders \nmake to peoples\u2019 lives. In exploring the interplay between border performed as place and \nborder performed as abstract line, Green\u2019s article calls attention to the ways all separations are \npartial and provisional precisely because they have to be occupied, lived in, appropriated and \nsomehow made workable.   \nThese tensions are also present in the final two papers which complete the issue by turning \ndirectly to markets and marketing. Kjellberg and Helgesson explore how markets are called \nupon to realize many different and changing values, drawing upon a variety of theoretical \nideas and producing a range of modes of engagement. Such modes include engaging to \nincorporate values in market exchanges; engaging to reform the values that will govern a \nmarket and engaging to represent the values produced by markets. Each of these modes \nhowever can be either promoted or retarded by the form of a given market and, for Kjellberg \nand Helgesson, efforts to shape what values the market is to realize become political only \nwhen they trigger responses that involve other modes of engaging. \nIn the final paper in the collection Franck Cochoy addresses the unsteady business of \nseparation head-on by tackling the economic politics of performativity. Through his analysis \nof Progressive Grocer, a trade journal which specialised in promoting new ways for small \nindependent grocers to modernize the business beginning in the early 1920s, Cochoy \ndescribes the emergence of particular politics of performativity. This was a politics which \ndrew from the production of new form of text designed not only to describe good practice but \nto build it from words but also from signs, pictures and models which combined actual and \nimagined practices to promote the imagined and actual production of newly modelled stores. \nIn their very different ways the contributions to this issue can be understood as attempts, in \nresponse to Callon\u2019s challenge in this issue and elsewhere to better situate where politics is. \nPolitics, as these articles tend to agree, appears at the turning point, in the place where the \nefficiency of economics is negotiated and where the need to forward it, reshape it, \ncomplement it emerges. It is to better understanding these turning points, these intersections \nthat the research collected in this special issue, as well as in the Journal of Cultural Economy \nmore broadly is devoted. \nReferences \nBarry A.; Slater D.
