The methodology is based on 16 \nfive repeated swath bathymetric surveys. The difference between the 2009 and 1999 17 \nbathymetry suggests that at least 395 Mm3 of material has entered the sea. This proximal 18 \ndeposit reaches 95 m thick and extends ~7km from shore. However, the difference map does 19 \nnot include either the finer distal part of the submarine deposit or the submarine part of the 20 \ndelta close to the shoreline. We took both contributions into account by using additional 21 \ninformation such as that from marine sediment cores. By March 2009, at least 65% of the 22 \nmaterial erupted throughout the eruption has been deposited into the sea. This work provides 23 \nan excellent basis for assessing the future activity of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano (including 24 \npotential collapse), and other volcanoes on small islands.  25 \n26 \n 3\n1- Introduction 27 \nSince 1995, the eruption of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano on Montserrat, Lesser Antilles, 28 \nhas been characterized by lava dome extrusion, dome-collapse pyroclastic flows, a sector 29 \ncollapse, and vulcanian activity [e.g. Young et al., 1998; Bonadonna et al., 2002; Cole et al., 30 \n2002; Carn et al., 2004; Hincks et al., 2005; Herd et al., 2005], with approximately 1 km3 of 31 \nmagma having been extruded by January 2009 [Wadge et al., 2010]. The eruption has 32 \nconsiderably modified the morphology of the island [e.g. Cole et al., 2002; Voight et al., 2002; 33 \nHerd et al., 2005] and the entrance of pyroclastic flows into the sea has created new coastal 34 \nfans at the mouths of the Tar and White River valleys, Figure 1a. For example, in July 2003, 35 \nthe active lava dome collapsed, depositing the majority of its volume (~190 Mm3) into the sea, 36 \n[Herd et al., 2005]. Previous studies showed that much of the material produced by the 37 \neruption has been deposited underwater, modifying and building upon the submarine flanks of 38 \nthe volcano [Hart et al., 2004; Le Friant et al., 2004, 2009; Trofimovs et al., 2006, 2008]. The 39 \ncoarsest components (predominantly > 2 mm) were deposited into the sea proximally (less 40 \nthan 10 km from the coast) as dense granular flows, while the finer fractions of the flow 41 \n(predominantly < 2 mm) were elutriated into the overlying water column and continued to 42 \nflow distally (up to several tens of km from the coast) as dilute turbidity currents  [Trofimovs 43 \net al., 2008].    44 \n High resolution swath bathymetry data has been collected during five repeated 45 \nsurveys offshore Montserrat throughout the course of the eruption (January 1999, March 2002, 46 \nMay 2005, December 2007, March 2009). Analysis of depth changes have previously been 47 \nundertaken, for example, offshore from Stromboli volcano [Chiocci et al., 2008], from 48 \nsubmarine eruptions on the mid-ocean ridge [Fox et al., 1992] and more recently in the 49 \nMariana and Kermadec arcs [Walker et al., 2008]. However, the Montserrat data set is the 50 \nmost complete available for an eruption from an explosive island volcano for answering 51 \nimportant questions including: What is the marine record of major eruptions and lava dome 52 \n 4\ncollapses offshore from a small island? What proportion of material enters the sea during an 53 \nexplosive eruption, and how does this fraction change over time? What are the implications for 54 \nthe growth of the submarine flanks of island volcanoes and the occurrence of potentially 55 \nhazardous submarine slope failures? 56 \n In this paper, we present an overall analysis of the current Soufri\u00e8re Hills eruption 57 \nfrom an offshore perspective by first computing the swath bathymetry differences to provide 58 \nan estimate of the volume of proximal material that entered the sea over a period of ten years 59 \n(1999 - 2009). However, the difference map does not include either the finer distal part of the 60 \ndeposit or the most proximal deltas close to the shoreline. We then used additional information 61 \nto estimate the entire volume of offshore deposits since the beginning of the eruption. In 62 \naddition, comparison with on-land data (published collapse volumes estimates) complete the 63 \nstudy.  64 \n 65 \n2- Background to the eruption 66 \nMontserrat consists of four volcanic massifs with ages and degrees of erosion that 67 \ndecrease from north to south [Harford et al., 2002], Figure 1a. The active Soufri\u00e8re Hills 68 \nvolcano is located in the southern part of the island. 69 \nSince the beginning of the eruption, five main episodes of lava dome growth have been 70 \nrecorded [Wadge et al., 2010]: July 1995 to March 1998, November 1999 to early August 71 \n2003, April 2005 to April 2007, July 2008 to January 2009 and a new period of dome growth 72 \nthat began in October 2009 after a pause of 10 months, Figure 2. During these periods of lava 73 \ndome growth numerous dome collapse events have occurred. On 12-13 July 2003, the largest 74 \ndome collapse of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills eruption occurred involving a collapse volume of 210 75 \nMm3 [Herd et al., 2005]. The majority of the material (190 Mm3) entered the sea via the Tar 76 \nRiver valley over a period of approximately 24 hours.  The second largest lava dome collapse 77 \noccurred on 20 May 2006, [Trofimovs et al., Emplacement of submarine pyroclastic flows into 78 \n 5\nthe ocean during the 20th May 2006 dome collapse of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano, Montserrat, 79 \nBulletin of Volcanology, submitted]. The bulk of the lava dome, together with eroded and 80 \nincorporated underlying strata (~115 Mm3) entered the sea in less than 3 hours in the form of 81 \nhigh-energy pyroclastic flows. In addition to the major collapses, smaller volume pyroclastic 82 \nflows have entered the sea: > 25 Mm3 (12 May 1996 + 28 July 1996 + 17 September 1996 + 83 \n25 June 1997 + 4 and 6 November 1997 + 26 December 1997); 10 Mm3 (3 July 1998); 30 84 \nMm3 (20 March 2000); 45 Mm3 (29 July 2001). The volumes of material entering the sea, 85 \nindicated above, were reported from onshore observations [Young et al., 1998; Bonadonna et 86 \nal., 2002 ; Cole et al., 2002; Carn et al., 2004 ; Hincks et al., 2005, Herd et al., 2005, 87 \nTrofimovs et al., 2006]. Uncertainty estimates on the subaerial volumes were analysed by 88 \nWadge et al. [2010] and are reported in Auxiliary material A-1. Additional minor pyroclastic 89 \nflows have entered the sea during the eruption, however their volume has not been quantified.  90 \nWe thus compute, from the above onshore observations, that more than 380 Mm3 of material 91 \nentered the sea from 1999 to 2009 and more than 415 Mm3 since the beginning of the eruption 92 \n(1995 \u2013 2009).  93 \n 94 \n 3- Swath bathymetry data and method 95 \nSwath bathymetry data and marine sediment cores were collected around Montserrat 96 \nduring five different cruises in January 1999 (Aguadomar, N\/O L\u2019Atalante, [Deplus et al., 97 \n2001]); March 2002 (Caraval, N\/O L\u2019Atalante, [Le Friant et al., 2004, 2008, 2009]), May 98 \n2005 (JCR 123, RRS James Clark Ross, [Le Friant et al., 2009, Trofimovs et al., 2006, 2008]), 99 \nDecember 2007 (JC18, RRS James Cook, [Trofimovs et al., submitted]) and March 2009 100 \n(Gwadaseis, N\/O Le Suro\u00eet). All surveys have encompassed the base of the Tar River Valley, 101 \nwhich represents the main entry point into the ocean of the most recent dome collapse 102 \nmaterial. Detailed comparisons between the 1999, 2002 and 2005 bathymetry have been 103 \n 6\nprovided in Le Friant et al. [2009]. Trofimovs et al [submitted] have documented the 104 \nsubmarine deposits from the 20 May 2006 dome collapse.  105 \nWe consider the volume of products that have entered the sea over a period of ten years 106 \nby computing the differences between the gridded bathymetric surveys of January 1999 107 \n(Aguadomar) and March 2009 (Gwadaseis), Figure 1b,c.  108 \nPredicted depth accuracy for both multibeam echosounding systems is about 0.1 to 0.3 109 \n% of depth (thus from 1 to 3 m in water depths of 1000 m). Navigation was achieved using 110 \nStarfix differential GPS during the Aguadomar cruise and GPS with no degradation during 111 \nGwadaseis. Both allow ship positioning accuracy of a few metres. Data was collected using the 112 \nsame procedures and processed using the CARAIBES software developed by IFREMER. The 113 \ndigital terrain models have been constructed using the same mesh grid parameters with cell 114 \nsizes of 50 m. To quantify the accuracy of the depth differences, we analysed the differences in 115 \nareas where no new volcanic deposits occur over the time period and we show their 116 \ndistribution in Figure 1b. The differences are roughly centered about zero with a mean value of 117 \n-0.14 m and a standard deviation of 3.80 m. Note that the observed standard deviation for the 118 \ndifference map is about twice the value of the predicted depth accuracy of a single survey 119 \nwhich attests of the quality of the data. We use the value of the standard deviation as the 120 \nminimum threshold thickness that defines the area of minimum new deposits. Therefore, the 121 \nareas off the Tar River Valley where the bathymetry residuals (depth changes) are larger than 122 \n5 m, are considered as new deposits (Figure 1c).  123 \n 124 \n4- Results  125 \nThe bathymetry difference map reveals that significant submarine deposition has 126 \noccurred offshore the Tar River Valley (Figure 1c). The submarine 1999-2009 deposit is 127 \nlocated in a submarine embayment C2 offshore from the Tar River (Figure 1a). It consists of 128 \ntwo main morphological lobes. The northern lobe has a N75 orientation and follows the 129 \n 7\nnorthern rim of the submarine embayment, extending 5 km from the coast. The southern lobe 130 \nstrikes roughly west-east, extending 7 km from the coast. The maximum deposit thickness 131 \nreaches more than 90 \u00b1  5 m in the proximal part of the northern lobe and 71 \u00b1  5 m in the 132 \nsouthern lobe.  133 \nA significant east-west trending region of negative bathymetric residuals is observed 134 \nalong the northern rim of the C2 submarine embayment, Figure 1c. This area was previously 135 \nobserved in difference calculations from earlier bathymetric surveys [Le Friant et al., 2009] 136 \nbut was attributed to an artifact related to positioning accuracy and data processing on a steep 137 \nslope. In the 2009-1999 difference map this negative area exhibits a stronger signal. We 138 \nsuggest that it represents a real feature related to erosion of the northern rim of the submarine 139 \nembayment due to the collision of the pyroclastic flows with the submarine scarp. The 140 \nsuccessive maps presented in Auxiliary material A-2 show that pyroclastic material was first 141 \ndeposited within the south of the submarine embayment. With successive pyroclastic flows 142 \nand the continued construction of the Tar River Valley delta and submarine fan, the direction 143 \nin which submarine flows transport and deposit material is likely modified. 144 \nAnalysis of our repeated swath bathymetry surveys has allowed us to estimate the 145 \nvolume of the proximal submarine deposits off the Tar River Valley for the last 10 years of the 146 \neruption (January 1999- March 2009). The volume is estimated at ~395 Mm3 with an error less 147 \nthan 14% (according to the value of the standard deviation). 148 \n 149 \n5 \u2013 Discussion 150 \n5.1 - Volume estimate of the offshore deposit 151 \nThe bathymetry difference maps do not provide information for all the components of 152 \nthe submarine deposit (Auxiliary material A-3). First, the calculated volume excludes the 153 \nassociated distal fine-grained deposits which are beyond the resolution of the bathymetry 154 \nsurveys. From core analysis, Trofimovs et al. [2006, 2008, submitted] estimated the 155 \n 8\ncontribution of the fine grained distal component of the submarine deposits for each period of 156 \nthe eruption as: 157 \n- negligible from May 1996 to March 2002,  158 \n- about 90 Mm3 from 2002 to 2005, mainly due to the 2003 collapse, 159 \n- about 90 Mm3 from 2005 to 2007, mainly due to the 2006 collapse.  160 \nSecond, the swath bathymetry coverage achieved during the different surveys does not extend 161 \nto the coastline for safety reasons. Consequently, the submarine deposits which have 162 \nconstructed the White River and Tar River deltas near the shoreline are not taken into account 163 \n(0-100 m). Using a TerraSAR-X satellite image from January 2009 and the pre-eruption 164 \nbathymetry (Admiralty chart for Montserrat), Wadge et al., [2010] estimate a near-shore 165 \nvolume of about 147 Mm3 for those deltas. Third, the swath bathymetry collection began in 166 \n1999 but Hart et al. [2004] provide an estimate of the volume of about 92 Mm3 for the 167 \nsubmarine pyroclastic products which entered the sea between 1995 and 1998. Taking into 168 \naccount our data and these three contributions, we propose to estimate the volume of the 169 \nmaterial deposited offshore between 1995 and 2009 at ~ 814 Mm3 (395+180+147+92).  170 \n 171 \n5.2 - On-land comparisons  172 \nTo compare on-land collapse volumes and marine deposit volumes, we have to take 173 \ninto account the difference in density between the lava dome rock (2300 kg m-3) and the 174 \nexpanded products deposited on the sea floor (1800 kg m-3, [Trofimovs et al., 2008] except for 175 \nthe deltas (2000 kg m-3, Wadge et al., [2010]). Therefore, the estimated 814 Mm3 total volume 176 \nof the submarine deposits that was accumulated offshore Montserrat throughout the entire 177 \neruption (1995-2009) is equivalent to 650 Mm3 DRE (see Auxiliary material A-3). Subaerial 178 \nrecords suggest that more than 415 Mm3 of material has entered the sea since the beginning of 179 \nthe eruption (Section 2). The estimated on-land collapse volume is smaller than the submarine 180 \ndeposit volume. The difference can be partially attributed to uncertainties on volume 181 \n 9\ncalculations (Auxiliary material A-2). Additionally, the strong erosive capabilities of the 182 \npyroclastic flows on-land also contributes to volume discrepancies as underlying material is 183 \neroded and incorporated during transport and sometimes re-deposited over wider area. 184 \nSuccessive erosion\/re-deposition of submarine material also occurred during and after flow 185 \nemplacement but this does not affect the final submarine deposit balance. However, the 186 \nvolume of some minor collapses that generated pyroclastic flows that reached the sea has not 187 \nbeen quantified from subaerial records (e.g. collapse events with unknown volumes on the 188 \nFigure 2) and likely represents a major contribution. 189 \n 190 \n5.3 - Summary from the offshore perspective of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills eruption  191 \nThe current Soufri\u00e8re Hills eruption has provided a unique opportunity to analyze the 192 \ncomplex interplay between magma production, geomorphic evolution and sedimentologic 193 \nprocesses that affect a small volcanic island during a major eruption. Strong links between 194 \nsubaerial eruption observations and records of offshore deposition have been established. From 195 \n1995 to 2009, at least 1 km3 of magma has been extruded [Wadge et al., 2010] and we estimate 196 \nfrom offshore studies that about 650 Mm3 DRE of volcaniclastic material has been deposited 197 \non the seafloor (Figure 2). This represents 65% of the total extruded material, but the 198 \npercentage is higher when calculated after a large collapse and can reach ~90% for the 1999-199 \n2006 period. Thus, we propose that at least 65% of the erupted material has entered the sea 200 \nthroughout the on-going Soufri\u00e8re Hills eruption between 1995 and 2009. This is a minimum 201 \nvalue that also excludes the tephra resulting from successive vulcanian explosions on 1996, 202 \n1997, 2008 and 2009 and the abundant ash clouds associated with the numerous pyroclastic 203 \nflows, which were dispersed into the sea beyond the study region. This data emphasizes that 204 \nfor other similar small volcanic islands many small-volume eruptions of low volume are 205 \nprobably not taken into account when reconstructing volcanic histories using only terrestrial 206 \ngeological records [Le Friant et al., 2008]. 207 \n 10\n 208 \n The architecture of the proximal submarine pyroclastic fans from the current eruption 209 \nprovides insights into the processes that have built the submarine flanks of the volcano. The 210 \nnew deposits form tapering wedges that extent up to 8 km offshore. Kenedi et al. [Active 211 \nfaulting and oblique extension influence volcanism on Montserrat (West Indies): Evidence 212 \nfrom offshore seismic reflection profiles. Geophys. Res. Lett., submitted] have observed 213 \nburied thick tapering wedges that extend up to ~8 km to the east of the volcano. These are 214 \nthought to represent amalgamated submarine pyroclastic flow fans formed by numerous older 215 \neruptions of the Montserrat volcanic centres. The repeated accumulation of pyroclastic flows 216 \nrapidly overloads the submarine flank of the volcano beyond the angle of repose and may 217 \ngenerate potentially hazardous submarine slope instabilities [Le Friant et al., 2004]. 218 \n 219 \nThis study has developed a method for estimating the volume of pyroclastic products 220 \ngenerated by an eruption on an island volcano and deposited offshore. The use of bathymetry 221 \ndifference calculations has emphasized the value of repeated high resolution bathymetry 222 \nsurveys in order to: 1\/ monitor the evolution of volcanic island flanks; 2\/ characterize the 223 \nvolume of submarine deposits, which is useful when the activity of the volcano compromises 224 \non-land geological studies; 3\/ characterize the morphology of submarine volcanic deposits, in 225 \norder to better infer flow emplacement mechanisms; 4\/ detail and reconstruct the occurrence of 226 \nsuccessive submarine pyroclastic deposits, which in turn provide realistic constraints for 227 \nnumerical simulation of the flow and associated tsunami propagation (Auxiliary material A-2). 228 \nTogether with published information from sediment core analysis and satellite imaging, these 229 \nnew data allowed to estimate the total volume of submarine deposits. Such data and methods 230 \ncould prove highly useful in upcoming years to assess future activity from the Soufri\u00e8re Hills 231 \nvolcano and related potential hazards. For instance, the evolution of the cumulative volume of 232 \nextruded material and the cumulative submarine deposit volume is plotted on figure 2 233 \n 11\nthroughout the time. The gap between both cumulative volumes has increased significantly 234 \nsince 2007, suggesting the high probability of a new major lava dome collapse. At the time of 235 \nwriting, the lava dome has partially collapsed (11th February 2010) with a large part of 236 \nmaterial entering the sea. This highlights the ongoing relevance of studies such as presented 237 \nherein. The methods used in this study could also benefit risk evaluation on other volcanoes 238 \nwhere erupted material is deposited into the sea. 239 \n 240 \nAcknowledgments 241 \nWe thank the captains, officers, crews and the scientific teams of the: N\/O L\u2019Atalante, N\/O Le 242 \nSuro\u00eet, RV James Clarks Ross.
