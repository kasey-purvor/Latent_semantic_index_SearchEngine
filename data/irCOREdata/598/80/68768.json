Introduction\nComplex signals typically contain a great deal of information about the underlying processes\nthat generate them, but the extraction of such information can be difficult and requires methods\ndrawn from physics and nonlinear science [1]\u2013[4]. This is especially true of signals derived from\nliving systems. Their complexity arises in part from nonlinear interactions between subsystems\noscillating on widely differing timescales, and in part from the confusing influence of\nseemingly random fluctuations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity [1]\nexemplify the problem. It has long been appreciated [5] that they exhibit continuous widespread\noscillations, but their origin remains barely understood. As in the case of cardiovascular\nsignals [6], there are multiple rhythms enclosed within broad-band noise. In dynamical terms,\nthese oscillations might be attributed to limit-cycle attractors, because analyses of short\nsegments often reveal spectral peaks in particular frequency ranges. Interactions between the\nprocesses generating some of these EEG waves have been demonstrated [7] but not yet explored\nmuch.\nUnderstanding the interdependences between complex dynamical systems is of quite\ngeneral scientific importance, e.g. in physics, chemistry, biology and neuroscience; it can also\nbe of importance for, e.g. economics and sociology. Often, the underlying equations of motion\nare unknown, but a detailed quantitative description of interdependences can nonetheless be\nachieved by time-series analysis of experimentally measured observables. In recent years, a\nnumber of methods have been developed that allow one to detect and to quantify the strengths of\nthe possible interactions [8]. Asymmetric approaches have facilitated the detection of directional\ncoupling from time series. At some risk of over-simplification they can conveniently be divided\ninto three main groups: techniques based on interrelationships between parameters of oscillatory\ndynamics and, in particular, phase dynamics [9]\u2013[11]; state-space-based methods [12, 13] and\ninformation-theoretic approaches [14, 15].\nState-space-based approaches provide strong methods for detecting generalized\nsynchronization or directionality patterns between two coupled systems. Also, the fact that\nthere are not many free parameters involved in driving the state-space patterns makes such\nmeasures relatively easy to implement, and robust. Their main challenges are in finding well-\ndefined quantitative measures of directionality or driver-response and in that it is often difficult\nto localize the reconstructed properties in time. Generally, all three groups of methods tend\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3Figure 1. Short (3 s) segments of EEG signal for deep (left) compared with light\n(right) ana\u00e6sthesia.\nto make rather strict assumptions about the dynamics of the systems that generate the time\nseries, e.g. that they should be linear systems, or in the case of self-sustained oscillators that\nthey should be weakly-coupled. Furthermore, many of the approaches focus preferentially on\nthe low-dimensional deterministic part of the dynamics. In reality, however, the influences of\nnoise on nonlinear dynamical systems can be far from trivial [16]\u2013[18] and they constitute a\nsubject of continuing interest and importance. Real signals frequently result from dissipative\ndynamical systems under the influence of noise, and it is often useful to describe them in terms\nof Fokker\u2013Planck formalism [19].\nIn this paper, we combine the multidimensional Fokker\u2013Planck equation [16, 20] with\nmathematical modelling of the system dynamics, enabling us to extract model parameters\ndirectly from the measured time series [2, 3, 20]. We concentrate on the interactions\nbetween EEG \u03b8 waves and \u03b4 waves in an\u00e6sthesia, and characterize some of their properties.\nFollowing [20, 21] we apply a two-dimensional (2D) Markov analysis to EEG signals\nrecorded [22] from rats during deep and light an\u00e6sthesia (see examples in figure 1); and we\ncarry out a stability analysis of the deterministic part of the derived equations. We find in these\nexperiments that the dynamics falls into different universality classes for the states of deep and\nlight an\u00e6sthesia, enabling us to distinguish robustly between them. Although we treat brain\ndynamics explicitly, the method is applicable to complex systems quite generally.\nIn section 2, we describe succinctly how our experimental data were acquired from rats\nand pre-processed prior to analysis. Section 3 describes the basic method used for the analysis,\nand section 4 discusses how we applied it to the rat EEG signals and considers the results that\nemerge. Section 5 describes some simple tests undertaken to eliminate artifacts and to check the\nvalidity of the results. Finally, in section 6, we summarize and consider the main results, and\ndraw conclusions.\n2. Experimental methods and data acquisition\nA full description of how the signals were measured has already been given elsewhere [22],\nso here we just summarize the salient features. The experiments were performed on 10\nadults, male Wistar rats weighing 250\u2013300 g. The animals were each an\u00e6sthetized with a\nsingle intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (45 mg (kg body wt)\u22121) and xylazine\nhydrochloride (7 mg (kg body wt)\u22121). (Measurements were also carried out on a second group\nof rats an\u00e6sthetized with pentobarbital [22] but these are not discussed here.) As soon\nas the rat could no longer hold its upright posture, 10\u201315 min after administration of the\ndrug, it was placed in a darkened Faraday cage where sensors were mounted and recording\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n4started immediately. The EEG was recorded over the left and right parietal cortex with three\nhypodermic needles inserted under the animal\u2019s scalp to serve as electrodes. The EEG was\ndifferentially amplified by 103\u00d7 and low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 300 Hz. The\nresultant signal was fed through a signal conditioning system, digitized at 1 kHz with 16-bit\nresolution, and stored on the hard disk of a laptop computer.\nDepth of anaesthesia was assessed at 5 min intervals by a nociceptive stimulus, the skin-\npinch test, applied to the sole of the animal\u2019s front paw [23]. The recording started with a\nnegative test response, i.e. when the rat stopped responding with a reflex withdrawal of the\nlimb. The monitoring was terminated on the reappearance of a positive pinch-test response,\nas the animal immediately started to move thereby terminating reliable data recording. The\nduration of recording varied from rat to rat and was on average 87 min. The measurements were\nat a constant room temperature of 24\u00b1 1\u25e6C.\nThe EEG power spectrum is conventionally divided [24] into the frequency bands:\n\u03b4 (0.5\u20133.5 Hz); \u03b8 (3.5\u20137.5 Hz); \u03b1 (7.5\u201312.5 Hz); \u03b2 (12.5\u201325 Hz); \u03b31 (25\u201335 Hz); \u03b32 (35\u201350 Hz);\nand \u03b33 (50\u2013100 Hz). We calculated the time evolution within each band by application of\nthe continuous wavelet transform [6]. The EEG signal was bandpass-filtered, but only after\nextensive investigation of its time-frequency content by wavelet analysis, and particular care\ntaken to avoid any introduction of phase lags.\nThe transition from deep to light anaesthesia was determined by application of several\ncriteria: as the times when both cardiac and respiratory frequencies significantly increased\nand became significantly more variable [22]; as the times when the amplitude of \u03b4-waves\ndramatically decreased; and as the times when the amplitudes of \u03b8 and \u03b3 significantly increased.\nThese different criteria yielded consistent results. The transition is most probably associated\nwith the effects of the ketamine wearing off faster that those of xylazine so that in the light\nphase the effect of xylazine is dominant.\n3.

The minimum value of \u03c72 occurs\naround \u03c4M ' 0.1 s, corresponding to the Markov timescale within a \u03c3 confidence\nlevel. The insets plot short samples of the signals being analysed.\nThe Markov condition requires an n-point conditional probability function (CPF) P(q(t +\nn\u03c4)|q(t + (n\u2212 1)\u03c4 ), . . . ,q(t + \u03c4),q(t)) to be equal to a two-point CPF P(q(t + n\u03c4)|q(t + (n\u2212\n1)\u03c4 )). The timescale \u03c4 in which this condition is fulfilled is the Markov timescale (\u03c4M).\nFor multidimensional stochastic variables, it is hardly possible to check the Markov condition\ndirectly by means of n-point CPFs. We therefore use three-point CPFs, for which the Markov\ncondition corresponds [25] to\n\u03c72 =\n\u222b ( 3\u220f\ni=1\ndxi\n)\n[P(x3, x2, x1)\u2212 P(x3|x2)P(x2, x1)]2\n\u03c3 2J + \u03c3\n2\nM\n(2)\nbeing zero.

Figure 2 shows \u03c7 2 calculated for both \u03b4 and \u03b8 waves from\na rat EEG signal as a function of the timescale \u03c4 . In both cases, the minimum value of \u03c72 occurs\njust after 0.1 s, after which it hardly changes, corresponding to \u03c4M with one \u03c3 confidence level.\nUsing equation (1) with this value of \u03c4M, we can estimate the drift and diffusion coefficients\nfrom \u03b4(t) and \u03b8(t) as shown in figure 3. In doing so, we used 1D coefficients, i.e. in deriving\nthe drift and diffusion coefficients for each variable, the effect of the other variable was\nintegrated. Both coefficients can be well-approximated by low-order polynomials. The D(1)i\nwith i = \u03b4, \u03b8 indicate an overall damping behaviour, as shown earlier [26]. Moreover, the\nbehaviour of D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 and D\n(2)\n\u03b8\u03b8 implies that the noise is multiplicative in character: constant\ndiffusion coefficients represent additive noise whereas, for multiplicative noise, the diffusion\ncoefficients are functions of the dynamical variables. We tested whether the deviation from\nadditive behaviour is attributable to the finiteness of \u03c4M [27] by consideration [28] of a Taylor\nexpansion of the drift coefficients. We conclude that the effect of the higher order terms in \u03c4M\ncannot explain the apparently multiplicative nature of the estimated second coefficient, which\nimplies that the noise strengths are functions of the dynamical variables.\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n6\u03b4\nD\n(1\n)\n\u20133 \u20131.5 0 1.5 3\n\u20130.025\n0\n0.025\nda\nla\n\u03b4\n(a)\n\u03b8\nD\n(1\n)\n\u20133 \u20131.5 0 1.5 3\u20130.07\n0\n0.07\nda\nla\n\u03b8\n(b)\n\u03b4\nD\n(n\n)\n\u20133 \u20131.5 0 1.5 30\n0.02 da; n = 2\nla; n = 2\nda; n = 4\nla; n = 4\n\u03b4\u03b4\n(c)\n\u03b8\nD\n(n\n)\n\u20133 \u20131.5 0 1.5 30\n0.4\nda; n = 2\nla; n = 2\nda; n = 4\nla; n = 4\n\u03b8\u03b8\n(d)\nFigure 3.

The results of (a) and\n(c) clearly demonstrate different functionality for both the drift and diffusion\ncoefficients during deep as compared with light an\u00e6sthesia.\n4. Application to \u03b4 and \u03b8 brain waves in an\u00e6sthesia\nFigures 3(a) and (c) show that there are significant differences in the \u03b4 waves between deep and\nlight an\u00e6sthesia, consistent with earlier work [22]. On the other hand, panels (b) and (d) show\nthat little change occurs in the \u03b8 waves. The functionality of D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 changes markedly between\nthe two states as can be seen in figure 3(c): in the light phase, a parabola fits this coefficient\nvery well, while for deep an\u00e6sthesia we must use a fourth-order function to describe the central\npeak.\n4.1. Stationary solution for retrieved drift and diffusion coefficients\nWe can also examine qualitatively the stationary solution of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation around\nthe different extrema in D2(\u03b4). The solution is Pstationary = N0D2(\u03b4) exp(\u2212\n\u222b\nd\u03b4 D(1)D(2) ), where the\nintegration constant N0 can be derived by normalization of Pstationary. For simplicity, we suppose\nthat D(1)\u03b4 is well approximated by a line (D(1)\u03b4 =\u2212b\u03b4 where b > 0). In light an\u00e6sthesia, D(2)\u03b4\u03b4\nhas a minimum at \u03b4 = 0, whereas in the deep state there is a local maximum there. Focusing on\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n7the region around this point, D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 can be approximated as D\n(2)\n\u03b4\u03b4 ' D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 (0)\u2213 12 |D(2)\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03b4\u03b4 |\u03b42, where\n\u2032 denotes d\/d\u03b4. It is evident that the contribution of D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 to the stationary solution of the\nFokker\u2013Planck equation changes between deep and light an\u00e6sthesia. Two additional extrema\n(minima) appear in D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 during deep an\u00e6sthesia (figure 3(c)), causing a double-humped PDF in\ndeep an\u00e6sthesia (cf the single-humped PDF during light an\u00e6sthesia).\nTo test whether the behaviour of the system deviates from a Langevin description, we\ncalculated the fourth-order coefficients D(4)(x)= lim\u03c4M\u21920 124\u03c4M \u3008(x(t + \u03c4)\u2212 x(t))4\u3009 for x = \u03b4\nand \u03b8 , allowing us to determine whether the driving noise process 0j(t) exhibits deviations\nfrom a Gaussian distribution [16]. Only if D(4) vanishes is 0j(t) white Gaussian. The\nprobability density function (PDF) of the process then evolves according to a Fokker\u2013Planck\nor, equivalently, Langevin equation [16]. Figure 3 shows that D(4)\u03b4 is slightly above zero, but the\nmagnitude of this coefficient is less than one-fifth of the second coefficient D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 , for both deep\nand light an\u00e6sthesia. The fluctuations for the case of light an\u00e6sthesia are larger than for the deep\nstate. This can be seen from the observation that, in the domain of [\u22123\u03c3, 3\u03c3 ] in figure 3(c), the\nD(4)\u03b4 terms are bigger in the light case, which indicates greater fluctuation amplitude. In contrast,\nfor the \u03b8 band signals, D(4)\u03b8 compared with D\n(2)\n\u03b8\u03b8 was clearly above zero for both deep and light\nan\u00e6sthesia suggesting that a 1D Langevin description may be inadequate for modelling \u03b4\u2013\u03b8\nactivities.\nIn a 1D Langevin model, the effects of other components are integrated, e.g. the\n2D drift and diffusion coefficients can be integrated to yield the 1D ones as D(1)i (x \u2032i)=\u222b\nD(1)i (xi , x j)P(xi |x \u2032i , x j)dx j and D(2)i i (x \u2032i)=\n\u222b\nD(2)i i (xi , x j)P(xi |x \u2032i , x j)dx j . Obviously, the\ninformation about interactions and their directionality is lost. This is an important point:\nalthough we have clearly different functionality for D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 and a different pattern for D\n(1)\n\u03b4 , the\ndifferences are unclear in the case of the \u03b8 component and we should not thoughtlessly integrate\nout the effects of the other variable. So, next, we derive the drift and diffusion coefficients as\nfunctions of both \u03b4 and \u03b8 . Figure 4 shows all the coefficients calculated for deep an\u00e6sthesia.\nFigures 4(a) and (b) plot D(1)\u03b4 (\u03b4, \u03b8) and D(1)\u03b8 (\u03b4, \u03b8). The \u03b8 -component of the drift vector shows\nan almost linear dependence on \u03b8 and only weak variations with \u03b4. But interestingly, the\n\u03b4-component of the drift vector has strong functionality in both \u03b4 and \u03b8 (see figure 4(a)).\nWe used a 2D least-squares method to derive the functionality of the coefficients. In the case of\n\u03b8 , we have D(1)\u03b8 (\u03b4, \u03b8)= a + b\u03b4 + c\u03b8 with good precision and the value of b is small (|c\/b| ' 10\nfor all rats), while in the case of \u03b4 the situation changes dramatically. The best fit available is a\nthird-order polynomial with respect to \u03b4 and \u03b8 , D(1)\u03b4 (\u03b4, \u03b8)=\n\u2211\nm,n a\nm\nn \u03b4\nm\u03b8 n(m + n = 0, 1, 2, 3).\nIn figures 4(c) and (d), we plot the coefficients D(2)\u03b4\u03b4 and D(2)\u03b8\u03b8 of the diffusion matrix. It is\nevident that D(2)\u03b8\u03b8 , like D\n(1)\n\u03b8 , depends weakly on \u03b4. In both cases, a second-order polynomial\nof \u03b4 and \u03b8 such as\n\u2211\nm,n a\nm\nn \u03b4\nm\u03b8 n(m + n = 0, 1, 2) can describe the functionality of the two\ndiffusion components. In case of light an\u00e6sthesia, we find similar functionality albeit with\ndifferent parameters for the diffusion coefficients; but we find different functionality for the\n\u03b4-component of the drift coefficient, which has a much weaker dependence on \u03b8 . It was found\nthat these same patterns were repeated for all ten rats. Thus, they can be used to characterize the\ndynamical behaviour of the \u03b4 and \u03b8 brain activities.\nThe fact that D(1)\u03b4 and D\n(2)\n\u03b4\u03b4 have strong dependence on both \u03b4 and \u03b8 , whereas the D\n(1)\n\u03b8 and\nD(2)\u03b8\u03b8 hardly vary at all with \u03b4, shows that the EEG \u03b8 component influences the \u03b4-component but\nnot vice versa. This situation persists regardless of depth of an\u00e6sthesia.\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8\u22122\n0\n2\n\u22122\n0\n\u22120.02\n0\n0.02\n\u03b4\n(a)\n\u03b8\nD\n(1\n)\n\u03b4\n\u22122\n0\n2\n\u22122\n0\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n\u03b4\u03b8\n(b)\nD\n(1\n)\n\u03b8\n\u22122\n0\n2\n\u22122\n0\n0\n0.02\n\u03b4\u03b8\n(c)\nD\n(2\n)\n\u03b4\u03b4\n\u22122\n0\n2\n\u22122\n0\n0\n0.1\n\u03b4\u03b8\n(d)\nD\n(2\n)\n\u03b8\u03b8\nFigure 4. 2D drift, diffusion and fourth-order Kramers\u2013Moyal coefficients for\nthe deeply an\u00e6sthetized state of the same rat as in figure 3.

D(1)\u03b4 and D\n(2)\n\u03b4\u03b4 have strong dependences on both\n\u03b4 and \u03b8 , whereas the dependence of D(1)\u03b8 and D\n(2)\n\u03b8\u03b8 on \u03b4 is weak.\n4.2. Dynamics and fixed points (FPs)\nTo complete the analysis we need to derive a more quantitative description of the patterns\nappearing in the drift and diffusion coefficients. The generated Langevin equations give the\ndeterministic and stochastic parts of dynamics, which can be written as \u2202tqi = \u2202Dt qi + \u2202 St qi , of\nwhich \u2202Dt qi = D(1)i is the deterministic part of the dynamics and \u2202 St qi =\n\u22112\nj=1\n\u221a\nD(2)i j 0j . Because\nof the finite noise we do not have clear control of the stochastic term so, for simplicity, we just\ncompare the dynamics arising from the deterministic terms: we can derive the FPs and the\nstability exponents in the phase diagram from the deterministic parts of the \u03b4 and \u03b8 trends. We\nnote that another way to determine asymmetries in coupling is from measures based on the drift\nand diffusion coefficients [29].\nIn carrying out these analyses, we used all data we had for each rat [22], i.e. for a\nmeasurement of duration 30 min we had 30\u00d7 60\u00d7 1000 = 1.8\u00d7 106 sample data for our\nsampling frequency of 1000 Hz. Thus the results related to D(1), D(2), and D(4) are all supported\nby a good level of statistics. However, we have also checked our results by using different\nportions of data. We found that 5 min worth of data (300 k data samples) was sufficient to\ngive us a robust estimation of D(1), D(2) and D(4). In relation to the Markov length scale \u03c4M\nwe found that, although the results were obtained for \u03c4M = 0.1 (100 sample data), a range of\n80\u2013120 samples gave the same results. Diverging from this range, however, would drive us into\na regime where modelling based on the Markov process is no longer valid.\nTo examine the FPs and flows in the \u03b4\u2013\u03b8 phase space, we have to solve together:\n\u2202Dt q\u03b4 = D(1)\u03b4 (\u03b4, \u03b8),\n\u2202Dt q\u03b8 = D(1)\u03b8 (\u03b4, \u03b8),\n(3)\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n9\u03b4\n\u03b8\n\u20131 0 1\n\u20131\n0\n1(a)\n\u03b4\n\u03b8\n\u20130.4 \u20130.2\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\n\u03b4\n\u03b8\n\u20131 0 1\u20131\n0\n1(b)\n\u03b4\n\u03b8\n0 0.3\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\n\u221220\n2\n\u22124\n0\n4\n0\n0.2\n\u03b8\u03b4\n(c)\nP\nde\ne\np(\u03b4\n,\u03b8\n)\n\u22125\n0\n5\n\u22124\n0\n0\n0.2\n\u03b8\n(d)\n\u03b4\nP\nlig\nht\n(\u03b4,\n\u03b8)\nFigure 5. Comparison of the flow diagrams related to (a) deep and (b) light\nan\u00e6sthesia, derived from the deterministic part of the dynamics. Insets show in\nmore detail the areas around the stable FPs (shown as blue dots) and unstable\nfixed point (red dot). The figure illustrates the different universality classes\ncorresponding to deep and light an\u00e6sthesia. (c) and (d) show the joint PDF for\ndeep and light regimes, Pdeep(\u03b4, \u03b8) and Plight(\u03b4, \u03b8), respectively. The PDFs are\nevidently consistent with the results derived from the stability analyses shown in\n(a) and (b). The amplitudes of PDF plots are increasing from minimum in dark\nblue (zero) to maximum value at dark red.\nfor both deep and light an\u00e6sthesia. We find that there are two distinct regimes. Firstly, for eight\nout of ten rats during deep an\u00e6sthesia there are three nontrivial FPs. Two of them are stable in\nboth the \u03b4 and \u03b8 directions, and the third one is unstable in the \u03b4 but stable in the \u03b8 direction.\nFigure 5(a) shows the flow diagrams related to equation (3) for a typical rat. There is a region\noutside the two stable FPs in \u03b4\u2013\u03b8 space in which the flows take any initial point to one of\nthe stable FPs. However, when \u03b4 or \u03b8 are small enough that the initial point is close to the\nunstable fixed point, a small change in \u03b4 could take the flow to a different stable fixed point,\nhence implying that the joint PDF of the \u03b4 and \u03b8 , Pdeep(\u03b4, \u03b8), must have two distinctive peaks.\nSecondly, for all ten rats during light an\u00e6sthesia, we have only one attracting FP. Figure 5(b)\nshows that, for a typical rat, over the whole interval of \u03b4 and \u03b8 flows take any initial point to\nthe stable fixed point. Hence, in this case, the system appears homogeneous at large timescales\nand we must have one peak for Plight(\u03b4, \u03b8), unlike the previous case. To test this prediction,\nwe plot in figures 5(c) and (d) the directly calculated PDFs Pdeep(\u03b4, \u03b8) and Plight(\u03b4, \u03b8). They are\nin full agreement with the results of our stability analysis of drift coefficients. At least in the\npresent experiments, therefore, we may conclude that the dynamics of \u03b4\u2013\u03b8 activity falls into\ndifferent universality classes for the states of deep and light an\u00e6sthesia. However, this finding\nneeds further investigation and will be a subject of our future work.\nNew Journal of Physics 11 (2009) 103051 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n10\n5. Tests of the validity of the results\nWe now describe some tests that we carried out to confirm that our results relate to the real\ndynamics of the system, and are not just artifacts of filtering. To do so, we processed a dummy\nsignal consisting of Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck noise [30] by filtration in the \u03b4 and \u03b8 bands and then\nrepeated the whole analysis procedure. We used standard Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck noise with an\nadded sinusoidal interaction to simulate the external oscillatory components. The equation for\nthe dynamical variable is\nv\u02d9 =\u2212v(t)+ A sin(\u03c9t)+\n\u221a\n\u03be \u03b7(t) (4)\nwhere A corresponds to the coupling strength of the external oscillatory components, \u03be is the\nnoise strength, and \u03b7 is the white Gaussian noise.\nWe always obtained one attracting FP, implying the damping structure of the system.\nMoreover, when analysing the empirical data with 5 min moving windows for the \u03b4 and \u03b8 bands\nof the real signals, we observed that the change of pattern between deep (3 FPs) to light (1 FP)\nan\u00e6sthesia occurs very sharply: we estimated the D(1), D(2) for one window of data, and then\nrepeated the whole process explained in sections 4.1 and 4.2 by first deriving the functionality\nof D(1) and D(2) based on the dynamical variables, and then applying stability analysis to\nthe deterministic parts of the processes (similar to the procedure explained in section 4.2).\nInterestingly we found that even with the short 5 min data windows, we could distinguish clearly\nbetween two different phases, having 3 and 1 FPs for deep and light an\u00e6sthesia, respectively,\nthe transition from one to the other being related to the transition from deep to light an\u00e6sthesia,\nwhich occurs very sharply (\u223c1\u20132 min).\nFinally, we investigated the question of whether or not the same results can be derived\nfrom the phase dynamics of the variables \u03b4 and \u03b8 . We used the Hilbert transform [31] to detect\nthe corresponding phases; we calculated the time interval for each period of the phase; and we\ninverted these time series to derive new signals in frequency space. Note that the phases of \u03b4 and\n\u03b8 are defined only in a statistical sense because both waves are relatively broad in frequency.\nIt is only \u03b4 waves in deep anaesthesia that are relatively localized in frequency. For further\ndetails see [22].\nWe then processed the \u03b4 and \u03b8 phases using the Fokker\u2013Planck formalism. Reassuringly,\nbut unsurprisingly, there were no significant differences between the drift and diffusion\ncoefficients corresponding to the \u03b4 and \u03b8 phases in deep and light an\u00e6sthesia (not shown here).\n6. Concluding remarks\nIn conclusion, our Fokker\u2013Planck analysis of EEG signals has provided evidence of interactions\nbetween the EEG \u03b4 and \u03b8 wave activities in rats in deep and light an\u00e6sthesia. We have\ncharacterized the functionalities of \u03b4 and \u03b8 and shown that the functionality of \u03b4 alters\nwith changes in depth of an\u00e6sthesia.

Either mechanism would lead to\nneuronal hyperpolarization and reduce the activation of action potentials. The consequence of\nthe hyperpolarization is that the function of neurons is blocked. Where exactly this occurs\nis currently unknown. Specific suppression of activity in the regional-thalamic and mid-\nbrain reticular formation and hyperpolarization blockage of thalamocortical neurons has been\ndiscussed [33]. On the other hand, ketamine is considered as a drug that does not reduce\ncortical metabolism and glutamate release or depress sensory information flow through the\nthalamus [34]. Our observation that \u03b8 drives \u03b4, regardless of depth of an\u00e6sthesia is consistent\nwith this picture. It is an important result, suggesting that the changes in \u03b4-activity during\ndeep an\u00e6sthesia or sleep are mainly due to reduced sensory information from the spinal cord\nto the thalamus, rather than on account of reduced thalamocortical interactions. However, the\nphysiological and neurological implications of this finding remain to be further investigated.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank B Musizza for making the signals available.
