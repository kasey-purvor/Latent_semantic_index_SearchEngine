However, technical problems \u2013 largely information problems \n\u2013 face both the providers of insurance and potential buyers. These problems on both \nsupply and demand sides of the market suggest that the actuarial mechanism is not \nwell-suited to addressing risks associated with long-term care.  This line of argument \nunderpins the paper\u2019s main conclusion \u2013 that social insurance is a better fit. \n \n \nThis paper discusses the finance of long-term care, including care in a person\u2019s own home \n(domiciliary care) and residential care, including nursing care.  The central conclusions are \nthat there are welfare gains from being able to insure, but the mechanism of actuarial \ninsurance is not well-suited to the risks associated with needing long-term care.  The first \nsection explains why the ability to insure is beneficial and how the actuarial mechanism \nworks.  The next two sections discuss in turn the technical problems facing providers of long-\nterm care insurance and the information problems facing individuals looking to buy such \ninsurance, that is, problems on both supply and demand sides of the insurance market.  The \nfourth section considers a range of solutions, including finance from general taxation and \nsocial insurance.  The final section offers some strategic conclusions. \n \n1 The backdrop \n1.1 Why insurance?  \nIn the right circumstances, insurance has powerful advantages, both in efficiency terms and \nfrom a moral perspective. \n \nEFFICIENCY ARGUMENTS.  To illustrate the potential welfare gains from insurance, assume \nthat high-quality long-term care costs \u20ac30,000 per year, that one in six people needs long-\n                                                 \n1 This paper draws on Barr (2001a, Chs 2 and 5). I am grateful to an anonymous referee for helpful comments \non an earlier version. \n2 Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London \nWC2A 2AE, UK: T: +44-20-7955-7482; E: N.Barr@lse.ac.uk;  http:\/\/econ.lse.ac.uk\/staff\/nb \nNicholas Barr 1 June 2009 \n term care and, if so, needs it on average for two years.  Thus the typical person needs long-\nterm care for one-third of a year, at a cost of \u20ac10,000. \n \n In principle there are two ways in which a person could seek to finance such costs. \n\u2022 Actuarial insurance: if it is possible to buy insurance at an actuarially fair price (and \nignoring transactions costs), a person has to save enough to cover the average \nduration, e.g. 1\/3 year = \u20ac10,000.   \n\u2022 Self-insurance: in a world with no insurance, a person who seeks security must save \nenough to cover the maximum potential duration of long-term care, e.g. 20 years at \n\u20ac30,000 per year = \u20ac600,000. \n \nThus the welfare gains from insurance are large and obvious:  a person who is risk \naverse does not have to set aside \u20ac600,000, but instead pays insurance premiums which (in \npresent value terms) total \u20ac10,000.  A core conclusion is that insurance dominates self-\ninsurance. \n \nMORAL ARGUMENTS.  The philosopher John Rawls (1972) argues that in a just society the \nrules are made by people who do not know where they will end up in that society, that is, \nbehind what he called the Veil of Ignorance.  Insurance can be interpreted as an example of \nsolidarity behind the Veil of Ignorance: a person who joins a risk pool does not know in \nadvance whether or not he will suffer a loss and hence have to make a claim.  Insurance thus \nhas moral appeal.  \n \n1.2 How actuarial insurance works \nThe easiest way to see how actuarial insurance works is by example.  Suppose that there are \n100 of us;  that we decide to fly to Rome to see a football match, that each of us has a \nsuitcase worth \u20ac1,000, and that on average two per cent of suitcases get lost.  Thus each of us \nfaces a potential loss, L, of \u20ac1,000, which occurs with a probability, p, of two per cent.  In \nthose circumstances, it would be possible to collect 2% \u00d7 \u20ac1000 = \u20ac20 from each of the 100 \npeople, i.e. \u20ac2,000 in total;  in Rome, we would find which two people had lost their suitcase, \nand pay each \u20ac1,000 in compensation. \n \nNicholas Barr 2 June 2009 \n More formally, the actuarial premium for the ith individual, \u03c0i, is defined as: \n\u03c0i  = (1+\u03b1)piL (1) \nwhere pi L is the individual\u2019s expected loss, and \u03b1 is the loading the insurance company \ncharges to cover administrative costs and competitive profit. \u03c0 is the price at which insurance \nwill be supplied in a competitive market. For the purposes of this paper, insurance is actuarial \nif, as in equation (1), the premium is based on the risk of an event occurring and the size of \nthe resulting loss.   \n \n The intuition of this mechanism is straightforward.  Insurance premiums are high \nwhere the probability of loss is high (a young car driver) or where the potential size of the \nloss is large (driving a Rolls Royce). \n \nThis, broadly, is the way in which actuarial insurance operates.  Thus far there is no \nneed for state intervention.  A rational risk-averse person facing a known risk will buy \ninsurance, which the market can and will supply. \n \n2 Problems for insurers \n2.1 Technical problems on the supply side \nInsurance along the lines of equation (1) is efficient only if a number of conditions hold.  \nWhere they fail, actuarial insurance may be inefficient or impossible. \n \nINDIVIDUAL RISK, NOT COMMON SHOCK.  Insurance requires that the probabilities in equation \n(1) are independent, that is, that there are a predictable number of winners and losers. This \napplies to car accidents (if I crash my car, this does not affect the likelihood that you will \ncrash your car).  With a common shock, in contrast, if one person suffers a loss, so does \neveryone else.  If I suffer 5 per cent inflation this year so, broadly, does everyone else.  \nActuarial insurance generally cannot cope with common shocks. \n \nRISK, NOT CERTAINTY.  Insurance is a device to accommodate risk.  Thus pi in equation (1) \nmust be less than one.  If pi = 1, it is certain that the insured person\u2019s car will be stolen, and \nthe insurance premium will exceed the insured loss.  There is no possibility of spreading \nrisks, hence no gain from joining a risk pool.  The problem arises in two ways with medical \nNicholas Barr 3 June 2009 \n insurance.  First is old age: the probability of elderly people requiring medical care is high.  A \nseparate problem is pre-existing medical conditions: actuarial insurance can cover potential \nproblems, but not actual problems, that is, medical problems which the individual already has \nat the time that he\/she applies for insurance.  Pre-existing medical conditions are generally \nuninsurable. \n \nThe two conditions just discussed relate to the fundamental nature of insurance as a \ndevice for sharing risk.  The remaining conditions reflect information problems in insurance \nmarkets. \n \nRISK NOT UNCERTAINTY.  The insurer needs to estimate pi in equation (1) with reasonable \nprecision in order to calculate a premium. Insurance can cope with risk (where the probability \nis known) but not with uncertainty (where it is not).3  There are various circumstances in \nwhich the probability might not be well known. \n\u2022 Where the insured event is rare (e.g. early satellite launches), estimates of the \nprobability will have a large variance. \n\u2022 Where the problem is complex.  Actuarial insurance against future inflation is \nimpossible because the probability of different levels of future price increases cannot \nbe predicted.4 \n\u2022 Where the insured event has a long time horizon. \nA further condition is that all participants \u2013 both buyer and seller of insurance  \u2013 must \nbe equally well-informed.  The failure of this condition \u2013 asymmetric information \u2013 creates \ntwo further potential problems: adverse selection and moral hazard. \n \nADVERSE SELECTION.  Efficient insurance requires that high-risk individuals pay a premium \ncalculated from equation (1), based on a high probability of loss, PH, and low-risk individuals \npay a premium based on their low probability, pL.  With automobile insurance, someone who \nis twice as risky pays roughly twice the insurance premium. \n \n                                                 \n3 More formally, with risk the probability distribution of outcomes can be estimated with a relatively small \nvariance;  with uncertainty, the variance is large. \n4  The government can issue indexed bonds to deal with inflation; that, however, is not actuarial insurance, but \ntax-financed state intervention to assist private insurance. \nNicholas Barr 4 June 2009 \n Adverse selection arises where the buyer can conceal from the insurer the fact that he \nis a bad risk, and is thus an insurance-market manifestation of \u2018lemons\u2019 (Akerlof 1970).  The \nproblem is not that people differ in their riskiness, but that the insurer is less well-informed \nthan the buyer about the applicant\u2019s riskiness.  The individual knows he is a \u2018lemon\u2019 (i.e. a \nbad risk), but can conceal the fact from the insurer, hence the description of adverse selection \nas \u2018hidden knowledge\u2019.  The problem can arise if health care is an important part of employer \nbenefits:  firms with the best health care packages will tend to attract workers with health \nproblems, thus reducing the firm\u2019s competitiveness. \n \nMORAL HAZARD.  A second class of asymmetric information, moral hazard, arises where the \ninsured person can influence the insurer\u2019s expected loss, piL in equation (1), without the \ninsurer\u2019s knowledge (hence moral hazard is sometimes described as \u2018hidden action\u2019).  The \nproblem arises in two ways, concerning pi and L, respectively. \n \n 1) Endogenous probability: here individuals can manipulate the probability of the \ninsured event at little or no cost to themselves.  If people are insured they might drive less \ncarefully.  My extra spending on maintaining the brakes on my car reduces the probability \nthat I will have an accident.  But the insurer cannot monitor such expenditure and so will \nreduce my premium not by the (significant) decline in the probability that I will have an \naccident but by the (much smaller) decline averaged across all the drivers it insures.  Thus the \nmain beneficiaries of my spending on safety are other insured people who now pay slightly \nlower premiums. Given this externality, individuals face incentives to underinvest in \npreventive activities.  Moral hazard causes inefficiency, since people take less care than if \nthey had to bear the full loss themselves. \n \n A second manifestation of endogenous probability arises where insurance is \nconcerned not with an undesirable event that is beyond the individual\u2019s control but with a \ndesirable event that the individual can choose, the standard example being voluntary \npregnancy.  Individuals face no psychic cost, and can control the probability, pi, in equation \n(1).  This situation is very different from an unwelcome exogenous event \u2013 the problem \ninsurance is meant to address.  Cases of this sort are generally uninsurable for individuals.5 \n                                                 \n5 The problem can sometimes be sidestepped in group schemes, where the insurer can impose a pooling \nsolution. \nNicholas Barr 5 June 2009 \n  \n2) Endogenous L (the \u2018third-party payment problem\u2019).  Here the individual can \ninfluence the size of the insured loss, L. The intuition is straightforward \u2013 contrast the amount \nof champagne people drink if they pay for it themselves with their consumption of \nchampagne provided free by the airline.  Similarly, if the insurer pays all medical costs, both \ndoctor and patient can act as though health care were free, even though its social cost is \npositive, and generally large.  Moral hazard in this form leads to inefficiently high spending. \n \nThe problem of moral hazard is fundamental: the more complete the cover and the \nlower the psychic loss from the insured event, the less individuals have to bear the \nconsequences of their actions and the less, therefore, the incentive to behave as they would if \nthey had to bear their losses themselves. \n \nOne way of seeking to reduce the problem is through inspection of damage before \nmeeting a claim, for example with automobile repairs.  An alternative is to use incentive \nmechanisms, by sharing the cost between the individual and the insurer: frequent claimants \n(e.g. accident-prone car drivers) pay higher premiums; deductibles require the insured person \nto pay the first \u20acX of any claim, coinsurance to pay the first x per cent.  None of these \napproaches, however, faces the individual with the full marginal cost of any loss. \n \nIn analytical terms, adverse selection and moral hazard are both examples of \nimperfect information.  If the insurer could read the thoughts of insurees there could be no \nhidden knowledge nor hidden action.   \n \n2.2 Problems with long-term care insurance \nWhen considering long-term care insurance it is helpful to distinguish two probabilities: \np1 is the probability that a person will need care at some stage in his\/her life; \np2 is the probability distribution, given that a person needs care, of different durations \nof that care.6 If we assume that once someone needs care they will do so for the rest \nof their life this probability equals remaining life expectancy at the time a person fir\nneeds care. \nst \n                                                 \n6 Thus p2 abstracts from the probability of needing care (i.e. p1);  once a person needs care, p2 addresses the \nprobability distribution of different durations of care. \nNicholas Barr 6 June 2009 \n  \n When applied to long-term care, equation (1) becomes: \n\u03c0i  = (1+\u03b1) p1i  L(p2i) (2) \nwhere p1i is the probability that the ith person will need long-term care at some stage, and \nL(p2i) is the cost of care conditional on the person\u2019s remaining life expectancy at the date he \nor she first needs care. \n \nTo what extent does long-term care conform \u2013 or fail to conform \u2013 with the conditions \nin the previous section? \n \nINDEPENDENCE.  Probabilities of needing long-term care may not be independent.  If a \nmedical advance prolongs life to the point where more people end up needing care (i.e. an \nincrease in p1), the result is to increase the probability of needing long-term care for all policy \nholders.  This outcome would arise, for example, with dramatic progress in addressing \ncardiovascular disease and cancer, but much less in addressing dementia, since more people \nwould live to ages where dementia arises.  Similar issues can arise with p2, for example, a \nmedical advance that increases the average life expectancy of people in care. \n \nUNCERTAINTY is a problem for both (a) the relevant probabilities and (b) the costs of care.  \nEach requires discussion. \n \n Case 1: buying insurance when young.  Let us start with a young person wanting to \nbuy insurance.  Insurers have a broad idea of p1 and p2 for today\u2019s frail elderly. What they \nneed to know, however, are the relevant probability distributions for future cohorts.   \n \nOver the medium term, neither probability is known, since each can change over a \nlong time horizon (a person aged 30 buys a policy under which he might not make a claim for \n60 years). \n\u2022 p1 might get smaller because medical advances help people to care for themselves \n(e.g. tablets that deal with arthritis) or through technical advances with the same effect \n(e.g. cheap robots doing household chores for housebound arthritics).  On the other \nNicholas Barr 7 June 2009 \n hand, medical progress, by extending life, might increase the likelihood of requiring \ncare. \n\u2022 p2 might get smaller because medical advances keep people out of care for longer, so \nthat remaining average life expectancy at the time care starts is less.  On the other \nhand, if medical progress extends the duration of dependent life, the probability might \nincrease. \nThus the relevant probabilities cannot be known far in advance, and even the direction of \nchange is unknown.  Over such a long time horizon, the issue becomes one of uncertainty \nrather than risk. \n \n Case 2: buying insurance at the time a person needs care.   There is a tension between \nencouraging people to buy a policy at a younger or an older age. With younger people, the \nrange of uncertainty facing the insurer is greater but so are the gains to the individual from \nrisk pooling.  With older people, uncertainty is less but, since some people now have a high \nprobability of requiring care, the opportunity of risk pooling is reduced.   \n \nThe limiting case arises where a person takes out insurance only when he\/she needs \ncare.  In this case, there is no uncertainty about p1, which equals one.  Nor is there a major \nproblem about p2 which, at its simplest, is the person\u2019s remaining life expectancy, that is, \nhis\/her longevity risk.  In this case, long-term care insurance is equivalent to buying an \nannuity that pays \u20acX per year for the rest of a person\u2019s life, where \u20acX is the annual cost of \ncare. \n \nHow do the two cases compare?  Let us return to the earlier example, where care costs \n\u20ac30,000 per year and one in six people needs long-term care and, if so, needs it on average \nfor two years.  Thus, ignoring transactions costs: \n\u2022 Buying insurance when young:  if the probabilities are known, a representative person \nneeds care for one-third of a year, and so can buy insurance for \u20ac10,000, i.e. one third \nof \u20ac30,000; \n\u2022 Buying insurance when care is first needed:  a person entering long-term care \ntypically needs it for two  years, so that the relevant annuity costs \u20ac60,000, i.e. two \nyears at \u20ac30,000 per year.  A deferred annuity (e.g. one that pays for care only after \nNicholas Barr 8 June 2009 \n the first two years, but thereafter for life) would be cheaper because insurance cover is \nonly partial. \n\u2022 With no insurance, the person has to save for (say) 20 years, i.e. \u20ac600,000.  This is \ntrue whether we are talking about simple private savings or such devices as a long-\nterm care savings account, and whether or not there are tax incentives towards such \nsaving activities.7 \n \nIn comparing these options, the welfare rankings are clear:  Case 1 is superior to Case \n2, which is superior to no insurance.  Wider risk pooling dominates narrower risk pooling; \nand insurance dominates self-insurance. \n \nThus far we have discussed uncertainty about p1 and p2.  Uncertainty about the annual \ncost of care, L, is a separate problem.  It is well-known that the relative cost of services rises \nover time.8  But over the long-term the ability to predict the costs of care becomes \nquestionable.  Will costs rise because the cost of skilled labour rises?  Or will expensive \nlabour be partially replaced by cheaper capital (e.g. robots for some tasks) or by cheaper \npharmaceutical drugs?  As with uncertainty about the relevant probabilities there is doubt \neven about the direction of change. \n \nFor both reasons \u2013 uncertainty about the probabilities and about costs \u2013 there is a \nconsiderable \u2018funnel of doubt\u2019 about total future spending on long-term care.  The UK Royal \nCommission\u2019s sensitivity tests suggest that the total could vary by a factor of two (\u00a321 billion \nto \u00a339 billion) in 2031, and by a factor of nearly three (\u00a328 billion to \u00a376 billion) in 2051 \n(UK Royal Commission, 1999, Table 5.1; see also Nuttall et al., 1995).  In the face of such \nuncertainty, voluntary private insurance becomes highly problematical. \n \nADVERSE SELECTION.  As with medical insurance, the person buying insurance, knowing that \nhe is a bad risk, might be able to conceal that fact from the insurer.  Irrespective of reality, the \n                                                 \n7 It is well not to get too enthusiastic about tax incentives.  Lessons from behavioural economics explain why \ntax incentives do not have a major effect on pension saving;  but such incentives are expensive and can easily be \nregressive. \n8  The relative price effect (in the context of medical care also referred to as excess medical inflation) measures \nthe extent to which the prices of services tend to rise faster than prices generally. There are two reasons: the \nprice of labour tends to rise faster than the general price level (i.e. real earnings rise); second, services like \nhealth care and education have a higher-than-average direct labour content (see Baumol, 1996).  The argument \napplies at least as much to care services. \nNicholas Barr 9 June 2009 \n efficiency of insurance markets suffers when insurers think adverse selection is a reality.  \nEvidence from the USA (Sloan and Norton, 1997) suggests that adverse selection, whether \nreal or perceived, is a problem. \n \nMORAL HAZARD arises in two ways.  A person who has insurance that covers all the costs of \nlong-term care is more likely to demand care since the cost to him or her (at the time of use) \nis zero.  This is the third-party payment problem familiar from medical insurance.  There is \nan extensive literature on the range of instruments \u2013 incentive or regulatory \u2013 that seek to \ncontain costs in such circumstances.  \n \n Incentive-based mechanisms to contain spending include: \n\u2022 Cost sharing via deductibles (where the individual pays the first \u20acX per year) or \ncopayments (where the individual pays x% of the costs). \n\u2022 Preferred providers, whereby suppliers are chosen on the basis of competitive \nbidding. \n\u2022 Prospective payment mechanisms like health maintenance organisations or diagnosis-\nrelated groups.9 \n \nRegulation of spending includes: \n\u2022 Controlling the price that providers can charge. \n\u2022 Imposing an annual budget cap.  This can take the form of a global annual budget for \na hospital.  Or the cap can be at the level of the individual physician.  Or the cap can \nbe on reimbursement of all physicians, for example by retrospectively reducing \nagreed fees if physicians prescribe a greater volume of treatment than planned. \n \nLong-term care faces most of these problems.  In particular, if the insurance company \npays all the costs, a person is more likely to request care and\/or to request luxurious \naccommodation. \n \nIn contrast, a second aspect of moral hazard is very different from medical care.  The \nthird-party incentive increases the likelihood that a person will demand care.  But in this case, \n                                                 \n9 For fuller discussion see, for example, Barr, 2001a, Ch. 4, section 2.2. \nNicholas Barr 10 June 2009 \n the incentive applies not only to the policy holder but also to his or her family.  Insurance \ncover changes the balance of probability between care from family members and care by \nothers.  To guard against being put into residential care against ones will, it could therefore be \nrational not to insure (Pauly, 1990; Sloan and Norton, 1997). \n \nThus insurers are imperfectly-informed, and so design policies which reduce their \nexposure to risk in several ways.  To guard against uncertainty, premiums err on the side of \nsafety.  There is a cap on the total payout per year (though not usually on the number of \nyears), thus limiting L in equation (2).  Insurers attempt to counter adverse selection by \nrequiring full disclosure of an applicant\u2019s medical history, where a failure to disclose a \n\u2018relevant\u2019 fact invalidates the policy even where the insurer has not specifically asked for the \nfact.  Attempts to guard against moral hazard include contracts which offer cover against \ntightly-defined criteria, rather than for a more general need for care.  \n \n3 Problems for individuals \nAlongside these supply-side problems are problems from the perspective of individuals.  \nInsurance policies for long-term care are both long-term and complex.  As a result, \nconsumers face many of the problems now widely recognised from the economics of \ninformation and behavioural economics.  The following questions illustrate the problems \nindividuals face in choosing an insurance policy in a competitive system. \n \n What type of care is covered?  Does the policy cover only residential care, or also \ndomiciliary care; is a person entitled to residential care on the basis of general infirmity or \nonly if he or she has clearly-defined, specific ailments?  How will the answers to these \nquestions change with advances over the years in medical technology?   \n \nOn what financial basis is care provided?  Can the insurer increase premiums if a \nperson becomes more risky (i.e. if p1 or p2 rises);  is there a ceiling on the monthly cost of \ncare; is there a maximum duration over which benefit is payable?  Will those figures change \nover time in line with changes in prices, changes in wages, or changes in the cost of care?   \n \nNicholas Barr 11 June 2009 \n How well-specified is the contract?  Can insurers change the basis of cover; does the \nwording make clear the circumstances in which an individual can make choices; what \narrangements deal with any disagreements between the policy holder and the insurer?   \n \nComplications arise, fourth, because people may not know how much cover they \nactually have. If public funding becomes more generous, people with extensive private \ninsurance end up with an inefficiently large amount of cover.  Conversely, cuts in public \nfunding may leave people under-insured; and if such under-insurance occurs relatively late in \nlife, additional private cover is expensive. \n \nIn the face of such complexities, Burchardt and Hills (1997, Ch. 6) found that even \ntheir academic study could not unearth the data necessary for proper assessment of policies, \ncalling seriously into question the ability of individuals to make informed choices.  At a \nminimum, there is need for regulation to ensure that all policies cover at least a basic \npackage.   \n  \n4 Strategic policy directions \nPrivate, actuarial insurance works well for risks that conform with the conditions discussed \nearlier, for example, automobile insurance and burglary insurance.  But that does not mean \nthat the mechanism can be applied uncritically to other areas.  The conclusion of earlier \ndiscussion is that the mechanism faces major technical problems when applied to long-term \ncare.  Given the range of problems facing both sides of the market, the conclusion of the \nRoyal Commission on Long-Term Care (1999, p. 93), should not be surprising: \n\u2018Left to grow without intervention, there seems little reason to think that private \ninsurance will become more important in the UK than it has become \u2026 in America. \nAt present only 4%-5% of Americans have taken out long-term care insurance, while \n10%-20% could afford to do so and 80%-90% could not afford the cost in any event.\u2019  \n \n4.1 Social insurance as a response to information problems \nIn his classic article, Kenneth Arrow (1963) argues that, where markets fail, other institutions \nmay arise to mitigate the resulting problems: \u2018the failure of the market to insure against \nuncertainties has created many social institutions in which the usual assumptions of the \nNicholas Barr 12 June 2009 \n market are to some extent contradicted\u2019 (p. 967).   This line of argument contrasts with that of \nHayek (1945). Both Arrow and Hayek started from the assumption of asymmetric \ninformation. To Hayek the fact that different people know different things is an argument in \nfavour of markets. He argued that (as with skill differences) the market makes beneficial use \nof such differences by allowing gains from trade.  \n \nArrow shows that the market is an inefficient device for mediating certain important \nclasses of differences in knowledge between people. Nor is his view idiosyncratic. When \ndiscussing unemployment, Lucas (1987, p. 62) reached an identical conclusion: \n\u2018Since . . . with private information, competitively determined arrangements will fall \nshort of complete pooling, this class of models also raises the issue of social \ninsurance: pooling arrangements that are not actuarially sound, and hence require \nsupport from compulsory taxation. The main elements of Kenneth Arrow\u2019s analysis of \nmedical insurance are readily transferable to this employment context.\u2019  (emphasis in \noriginal) \n \nSocial insurance thus derives from two sources. The need for insurance arises \nbecause, at least in Western countries, the risk of needing long-term care is to some extent a \nsocial construct (the greater the fragmentation of extended families and the more widespread \nwomen\u2019s labour-market activity, the greater the likelihood that family support for the frail \nelderly will be insufficient).10 Second, on the supply side, information failures and the \ninability of actuarial insurance to address common shocks provide both a theoretical \njustification of and an explanation for, institutions such as social insurance. \n \nConventional social insurance mimics private institutions: benefits are conditioned on \nan implicit or explicit contributions record and on the occurrence of a specified event such as \nreaching pensionable age.  Administration can be by the state at national or sub-national \nlevel;  or administration can be hived off to institutions such as friendly societies or trades \nunions. \n \nSocial insurance, however, differs from private insurance in two important respects. \nFirst, because membership is generally compulsory, it is possible (though not essential) to \n                                                 \n10 On retirement as a social construct, see Hannah (1986). \nNicholas Barr 13 June 2009 \n break the link between premium and individual risk. Secondly, the contract is usually less \nspecific than private insurance, with two advantages: protection can be given against risks \nwhich the private market cannot insure, or cannot insure well (this paper argues that long-\nterm care is one); and the risks can change over time. Atkinson (1995, p. 210) points out that  \n\u2018the set of contingencies over which people formed probabilities years ago may have \nexcluded the breakdown of the extended family, or the development of modern \nmedicine, simply because they were inconceivable\u2019. \nThus social insurance, in sharp contrast with actuarial insurance, can cover not only risk but \nalso uncertainty.  \n \n The rest of this section discusses three approaches to financing long-term care:  \ntaxpayer finance;  social insurance during working life, that is, ex ante social insurance;  and \nsocial insurance ex post, for example a single premium paid out of a person\u2019s estate. \n \n4.2 Taxpayer finance \nSome countries (France, Germany) finance health care through social insurance, others (the \nUK) mainly through general taxation, with no explicit contribution.  Analogous options exist \nfor long-term care.  Germany, as discussed below, uses social insurance.  Scandinavia mainly \nuses tax finance;  so does England, though parsimoniously, and Scotland. \n \n It is not surprising that the stress point for this approach is fiscal pressures.  The \nargument against taxpayer finance of long-term care is less one of principle than that of the \npractical politics of maintaining salience in the competition for public funds.  Health care is \nbetter placed in this context, since many of its users are articulate and well-connected.  It is \nno accident that social care, not health care, is sometimes described as the \u2018Cinderella \nservice\u2019. \n \n4.3 Social insurance during working life \nTHE APPROACH.  This strategy extends existing mandatory social insurance. Workers pay a \nhigher social insurance contribution during working life to finance long-term care.  In this \napproach: \nNicholas Barr 14 June 2009 \n \u2022 Social insurance covers the costs of (a) meeting clinical need, and (b) providing good \nquality \u2018hotel\u2019 care. \n\u2022 The individual meets the extra costs of hotel care above that provided by the social \ninsurance arrangements \u2013 the purpose of social insurance is to finance good quality \ncare but, given resource constraints, not gourmet food or life in a stately home. \nThis paper makes no attempt to set out the detailed workings of this strategy, and so offers no \ndefinition of the boundary between \u2018good quality\u2019 and \u2018higher-standard\u2019 hotel care. 11 \n \n Public pensions take no account of the fact that women on average live longer than \nmen, and the requirement to use unisex life tables has been extended to mandatory private \npensions in many countries, including the EU and North America.  There are several reasons \nfor adopting this approach for long-term care.  First, if insurance is mandatory, there is little \nor no distortionary effect from charging men and women a premium based on joint \nprobabilities;  in particular adverse selection is not a major problem.  Second, there are \nobvious political difficulties from imposing on women a significantly higher contribution rate \nthan men, all the more since the differential is, and is likely to remain, much larger than for \npensions.  Finally, the use of unisex tables can be defended as a simple value judgment. \n \n The advantages of this approach are those of social insurance outlined earlier. First, \nthe system can adjust to changing realities, that is, can address uncertainty.  If the incidence \nof dementia increases sharply the system can accommodate the change, for instance by \nincreasing social insurance contributions.  Second, any restrictions on cover have democratic \nlegitimacy, for example legislative change to tighten eligibility rules as a response to medical \nadvances that prolong people\u2019s independence. \n \nTHE GERMAN SYSTEM. As discussed more fully in the paper by Heinz Rothgang in this issue, \nGermany has a system of this sort, whereby workers pay an extra 1.95 per cent on their social \nsecurity contribution.12  The system pays three different levels of benefit, depending on the \nextent of the person\u2019s incapacity, and offers three types of benefit:  in-kind domiciliary care, \n                                                 \n11 In this simple case, co-payments are zero or 100%.  It is possible to envisage intermediate options, with \ndifferent rates of co-payment depending on (a) policymakers\u2019 views about how essential a particular service is \nand (b) the extent of the person\u2019s dependence.  Given potential problems of transparency and hence political \nsustainability, such a policy is best regarded as a potential future agenda item. \n12 Since 2004, a person who has never had any children pays an additional 0.25 per cent.   \nNicholas Barr 15 June 2009 \n cash to allow a person to buy his or her own domiciliary care, and residential care.  There are \nadditional benefits, for example for adapting a person\u2019s house or to cover the costs of respite \ncare. \n \nThese arrangements, it can be argued, have the following advantages: \n\u2022 The system covers the entire population. \n\u2022 Contributions, at 1.95 per cent of income, are based on ability to pay. \n\u2022 The system provides help for informal carers through the cash benefit and also by \npaying the pension contributions of anyone who provides informal care for at least 14 \nhours a week. \n\u2022 The contribution mechanism offers some protection against demographic change, in \nthat the additional 1.95 per cent contribution is paid not only by workers but also by \npensioners. \n\u2022 The system widens and deepens the market for care. \n\u2022 Restrictions on benefit have democratic legitimacy. \n\u2022 The system is based on an existing administrative mechanism. \neditor: perhaps add cross-references to other relevant countries discussed in this issue \n \n4.4 Social insurance ex post \nIt has been proposed (Lloyd 2008) that long-term care could be financed via social insurance, \nwith the premium paid as a lump sum either at age 65 or out of a person\u2019s estate.  The idea \nbehind this proposal is twofold:  as a person gets older, the range of uncertainty about the \nprobability of needing long-term care (p1 in equation (2)) becomes smaller; and if a person \ncan buy insurance for a single premium payable out of his or her estate, the cost of long-term \ncare does not impinge on his or her living standard during working life or in retirement, but \ncan frequently be taken from housing wealth. \n \n This approach faces a number of questions. \n \nSHOULD MEMBERSHIP BE VOLUNTARY?   There is ample evidence from the pensions literature, \ndrawing on lessons from the economics of information (Barr and Diamond, 2008, Box 4.2) \nand behavioural economics (ibid., Box 9.6), that when choices are complex, people make bad \nNicholas Barr 16 June 2009 \n choices or no choice at all.  Many people realise that they need to save more for their old-age \nsecurity and intend to so do \u2013 but somehow it never happens.  In Sweden, workers are \nrequired to choose the provider of the private element of their pension, there being over 750 \nsuch providers;  workers who make no choice are allocated to the default fund;  in 2005, 90 \nper cent of new workers in Sweden made no choice and were placed in the default fund \n(Sweden Ministry of Finance, 2005, p. 36). \n \n It would be a brave assertion to argue that voluntary choices about long-term care \ninsurance would be any better.  The issue is complex, as explained earlier, and  people tend to \nprocrastinate. \n \n Compulsion makes politicians nervous, but has significant economic advantages. \n\u2022 It recognises the evidence from behavioural economics that people do not always \nmake decisions in their own self-interest. \n\u2022  It avoids adverse selection, since good risks cannot opt out and bad risks cannot \nchoose to buy inefficiently large amounts of cover.  \n\u2022 A system that is compulsory allows some redistribution;  thus it is possible to charge a \ncontribution of x per cent of earnings, respecting ability to pay. \n \nThe political problems of compulsion should not be exaggerated.  Contributions for \nlong-term care are smaller than for pensions, since the probability of needing long-term care \nis lower than that of reaching pensionable age and, where a person needs care, the average \nduration is less than the average length of time for which a person receives a pension (in the \nterminology of equation (2) both p1 and p2 are smaller for long-term care than for pensions).  \nSecondly, the pill of compulsion can be sweetened if it is possible to top up the benefits from \nthe compulsory system with privately-financed benefits. \n \nAn option intermediate between voluntarism and compulsion is to allow self-\ninsurance or only partial insurance for (say) the first two years of needing care;  the \nmandatory social insurance system would pay the costs beyond two years. \n \nPREPAYMENT OR POST-PAYMENT?  Should a person pay the single premium at (say) age 65 or \nbe allowed to pay retrospectively out of his\/her estate?  There are two questions.  First, \nNicholas Barr 17 June 2009 \n should a person be allowed to decide later whether or not to insure?  The answer is clear:  \ninsurance works only behind the Veil of Ignorance, that is, people have to precommit.  \nAllowing a person to decide later whether to insure creates insoluble problems of adverse \nselection, since the only people who buy insurance are those who find that they need long-\nterm care \u2013 the system degenerates into self-insurance through the insurance equivalent of \nGresham\u2019s Law.13 \n \n A different question is whether a person should be allowed to pay later.  The \neconomic answer is that, so long as the decision to participate has been made earlier, \nallowing people to pay later is compatible with insurance;  what is necessary is a premium \nwhose present value equals the average cost of care. \n \nThe political answer, however, is different.  Allowing people to pay retrospectively is \npolitical dynamite, because many people do not understand the idea of insurance.  People \nmay not need long-term care, but when they die the single premium is a claim on their estate. \nAnd what if the payment absorbs their entire estate?  What about a person who chooses to \npay on his\/her 65th birthday and dies three weeks later? What about the incentives for a \nperson to give away his or her entire estate? \n \n5 Conclusion \nEarlier discussion suggests powerful analogies with health care:  delivery can be public, \nprivate or mixed;  on finance there is a strong case for relying mainly on public finance.  \nThese conclusions are technical rather than ideological. \n \nMore specifically, the analysis in this paper suggests robust conclusions about the \nfinance of long-term care. \n\u2022 Self-finance (i.e. financing long-term care out of personal savings or a long-term-care \nsavings account) is an inferior solution.  Where someone is risk averse the possibility \nof pooling risk is welfare enhancing. \n                                                 \n13 According to Gresham\u2019s law, bad money drives out good.  If insurers cannot distinguish high- and low-risk \nbuyers, the people who buy insurance will tend to be the bad risks, pushing up insurance premiums and driving \nout the good risks, who do not find it worth insuring at the higher price. \nNicholas Barr 18 June 2009 \n \u2022 Actuarial private insurance, for technical reasons \u2013 largely connected with \ninformation failures in insurance markets \u2013 is badly suited to the risks involved in \nlong-term care, in particular the risk that a person will need long-term care (p1 in \nequation (2)). \n\u2022 Taxpayer finance is implausible in the English context;  it is also implausible \nelsewhere, given competing fiscal demands connected with population ageing, \nnotably rising spending pressures for pensions and health care, and given global \ncompetitive pressures.  These long-term trends are all quite separate from the current \neconomic crisis. \n\u2022 Ex-post social insurance:  a mandatory system in which people pay a single premium \nat (say) age 65 or out of their estate could work in economic terms, but the political \ndifficulties are likely to be insurmountable.  This is all the more the case, since the \ngain from an ex-post system, as opposed to an ex ante system, is very limited. \n\u2022 Ex-ante social insurance:  there is a strong case for extending social insurance to \nprovide mandatory cover for long-term care.  Social insurance is able to address the \nmajor insurance-market problems discussed earlier, is well-understood politically, and \nin administrative terms piggy backs onto existing arrangements.  Such a system \nshould be large enough to cover all, or almost all, the costs of a good standard of care, \ncovering both clinical needs and \u2018hotel\u2019 costs.  Topping up should be an option, either \nfrom private saving or through supplementary private insurance, if that is available on \nterms that people are prepared to pay.  Topping up can be defended both because \npeople have very different tastes, and as a political price for a mandatory system that \ncovers everyone.  As with other elements of social insurance, and increasingly with \nprivate insurance, the system should be based on unisex probabilities.  \n \n \nNicholas Barr 19 June 2009 \n Nicholas Barr 20 June 2009 \nReferences \n \nAkerlof, George A.
