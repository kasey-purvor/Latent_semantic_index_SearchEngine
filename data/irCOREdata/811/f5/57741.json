The number of important scales that have been widely adopted is \nmuch smaller, perhaps about eight, not counting minor variants. Where data sets \nexist that are expressed in different scales, it is often necessary to establish \nsome sort of equivalence between them, although best practice would be to \nreassign intensity values rather than convert them. This is particularly true \nbecause difference between workers in assigning intensity is often greater than \ndifferences between the scales themselves, particularly in cases where one scale \nmay not be very well defined. The extent to which a scale guides the user to \narrive at a correct assessment of the intensity is a measure of the quality of the \nscale. There are a number of reasons why one should prefer one scale to \nanother for routine use, and some of these tend in different directions. If a scale \nhas many tests (diagnostics) for each degree, it is more likely that the scale can \nbe applied in any case that comes to hand; but if the diagnostics are so \nnumerous that they include ones that do not accurately indicate any one intensity \n 2\nlevel, then the use of the scale will tend to produce false values. The purpose of \nthis paper is chiefly to discuss in a general way the principles involved in the \nanalysis of intensity scales. Conversions from different scales to the European \nMacroseismic Scale is discussed. \nKeywords \nIntensity, intensity scales, macroseismology, history of seismology \n 3\nIntroduction \nIn the beginning was the Scale, and the name of the Scale was Rossi-Forel. \nThe above is actually not strictly correct, but serves as a reminder that there was \na time, at the end of the 19th century, when macroseismic intensities were \nassessed throughout the world using a single, recognised intensity scale. This \nwas the Rossi-Forel Scale (de Rossi 1883), and thus \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cRossi-Forel\u201d \n(RF) were effectively synonymous, and intensity came in ten degrees, since this \nwas the number of degrees in the RF Scale. It is rather curious that today, RF \nintensity is largely forgotten. \nAlthough RF was the first scale ever to be widely adopted, it was, of course, not \nthe first intensity scale. It was itself a compromise between the scales proposed \nindependently and near-simultaneously by de Rossi (1874) and Forel (1881). But \nthe first recognisable intensity scale in the modern understanding of the term \ngoes back to the work of Egen (1828), some fifty years previously. Egen\u2019s \ninnovation was ahead of its time. \nIn the course of time, the inadequacies of the RF scale led to the development of \nmodified versions, entirely new scales, and modifications that so departed from \nthe original that they were effectively new scales. As of 1921, Charles Davison \nwas able to identify 27 different intensity scales, though some of these were \nsubjective, or classifications of earthquakes rather than strength of shaking at a \nplace (Davison 1921). A follow-up study in 1933 increased the number of \ndifferent scales from 27 to 39, with between three and twelve degrees (Davison \n1933). Obviously the number has considerably increased since then. \nFrom the reader\u2019s point of view, the multiplicity of scales can be confusing and \ncause problems of interpretation. This is all the more the case when (as is very \nfrequent) the scale used in any study is not distinctly identified. The comparison \nof different intensity scales is thus an important issue, which has not really been \n 4\nstudied in any depth in the literature. Under the general heading of \u201ccomparison\u201d, \ntwo separate issues can be identified. The first is the vexed practical question of \nconversion between scales. If one wishes to establish a correlation between (say) \nepicentral intensity and magnitude, and one has a table of values from one study \nof RF intensities, and another of MSK (Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karn\u00edk) intensities, \ncan they be combined, and if so, how? The second is a more theoretical question \nof the evaluation of scales. Can one say that one scale is better than another? \nBoth these issues will be addressed in this paper. \nIt should be understood that intensity scales have more than one use in \nseismology. The original purpose of using intensity was to parameterise \nearthquake effects in a descriptive way, from observational data. More recently, \nintensity has also been used in a predictive way, in hazard and risk studies, \nwhere loss estimates can be inferred from expected intensity values. The present \npaper is concerned chiefly with the observational use of intensity scales (as, for \ninstance, by institutes responsible for seismic monitoring, including web-based \nmacroseismic surveys, or in studies of historical earthquakes). It should also be \nstressed that this paper intends to discuss the general issues involved in \ncomparing and evaluating intensity scales; it is not intended to be a review of any \nparticular scales in themselves. \nCancani and non-Cancani scales \nHowever, there is a particular matter that requires some preliminary discussion, \nand that is the number of degrees a scale may have, and in particular, the \ndivision of intensity scales into two classes: firstly, those that have twelve \ndegrees and descend ultimately from the proposal of Cancani (1904), and other \nscales. Since the first group form a family of scales that are broadly compatible \nwith one another, comparison issues are different from cases in which totally \ndiverse scales are being compared. Some historical background is helpful here \n 5\n(see also Musson and Ceci\u010d 2002). Throughout this paper we use Arabic \nnumerals for intensity, rather than the now rather antiquated Roman numerals, \nwhich are ill-adapted to computer files. \nThe history of how the Cancani family evolved is also the story of how the name \nof Rossi-Forel became forgotten, to be replaced to some extent by the name of \nMercalli. Mercalli was actually the author of two intensity scales. The first of these \n(Mercalli 1883) is described by Davison (1921) as \u201cmerely an adaptation of the de \nRossi scale\u201d. It has six degrees unlike the ten degrees of de Rossi, and is now \nmore or less forgotten. \nMercalli\u2019s second scale, published in 1902, is a modification of the RF Scale \n(Mercalli 1902). The ten-degree structure is retained, but the descriptions of each \ndegree are considerably amplified. For example, 5 RF is defined: \nFelt generally by everyone; disturbance of furniture and beds; ringing of \nsome bells. \n(In all these extracts the translations of Davison 1921, 1933, are followed. In this \npaper, we take examples mostly from lower intensity degrees as here the general \npoints of comparison can be demonstrated more succinctly.) Compare Mercalli: \nRather strong, felt generally indoors, but by few outside, with waking of \nthose asleep, with alarm of some persons, rattling of doors, ringing of bells, \nrather large oscillation of suspended objects, stopping of clocks. \nMercalli\u2019s fuller version found favour with users, and the scale was adopted as \nstandard by the Central Office of Meteorology and Geodynamics in Rome \n(Davison 1921). A large number of incorrect remarks concerning this scale can \nbe found in articles on the Internet, including common assertions that Mercalli \ninvented the idea of intensity scales, and that the 1902 scale had twelve degrees. \nA modification was proposed by Cancani (1904) for dealing with very strong \nearthquakes, which consisted of adding two extra degrees at the top of the scale. \n 6\nThus the first twelve-degree scale was born. Mercalli\u2019s 1902 scale already had \ntitles for each degree, of which the top three (8-10) were \u201cRuinous \u2013 Disastrous \u2013 \nVery Disastrous\u201d. The two new degrees (11-12) were labelled \u201cCatastrophe\u201d and \n\u201cEnormous Catastrophe\u201d. This twelve-degree structure has come to dominate \nmost of the scales in major use since. Ironically (in view of later developments), \nCancani proposed that the new twelve degree scale be named the \u201cForel-Mercalli \nScale\u201d (thus cutting out de Rossi). In general, it saves confusion if scales are not \nnamed after people who are not their authors, and it is much better to follow \nDavison (1921) by referring to this innovation of 1904 as the Cancani Scale.  \nCancani\u2019s scale was never really usable as he proposed it, since his text consists \nonly of the titles of each degree, i.e. one or two words per degree, plus a \nsuggested peak ground acceleration equivalent. Consequently, the next \ndevelopment was the complete overhaul of the definitions of the degrees by \nSieberg (1912). This involved very considerable expansion. Intensity 5 now read \nas follows: \nRather strong.  \nEven during the busiest hours of the day, the earthquake is felt by many \npersons in the open air. Indoors, the shaking of the whole building is \ngenerally noticed, the feeling being the same as when some heavy object \n(such as a sack or piece of furniture) falls in the house; or the observers \nmove, together with chair, bed, etc., as in a ship on an agitated sea. Plants, \nthe branches and weaker boughs of shrubs and trees sway visibly, as they \ndo with a moderate wind. Freely hanging objects, such as curtains and \nlamps, but not heavy chandeliers, oscillate; small bells ring; the pendulums \nof clocks are stopped or swing more widely according as the direction of the \nshock is at right angles or parallel to the plane of oscillation; similarly, \nstopped pendulum clocks are set going; the striking spring of clocks \nsounds; electric lights fail to act when contact of the conducting wire is \n 7\nmade; pictures rattle against the walls or are displaced; small quantities of \nliquid are spilt out of well-filled open vessels; ornaments, small standing \nframes fall and also objects leaning against the wall; even light furniture \nmay be somewhat shifted from its place, rattling of furniture; doors and \nwindow-shutters open or shut; window panes crack. Sleepers as a rule are \nawakened. A few persons run into the open air. \nClearly this is changed far more from Mercalli (1902) than Mercalli is from Rossi-\nForel. Not only is the description greatly expanded in detail, a new class of \ninformation is added \u2013 effects on nature (plants sway visibly). And some details \nare actually changed. Mercalli has few people outside feeling the earthquake at \nintensity 5, while Sieberg has many. \nThis scale is rightly referred to by Davison (1921) as the Sieberg Scale, and \nalthough the twelve-degree structure of later scales is derived from Cancani, \n(hence the title of this section of this paper) the content of most later scales is \noverwhelmingly influenced by Sieberg. \nThe new scale, clearly an advance on all previous scales, became in a later \nversion (Sieberg 1923) referred to as the \u201cMercalli-Cancani Scale, formulated by \nSieberg\u201d \u2013 or more simply, the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg Scale, or MCS. The \ndefinition of the intensity degrees 1 to 6 of Sieberg (1912), are identical with \nthose of Sieberg (1923). The innovations in Sieberg 1923, concentrate on the \ndegrees 6 and 7.  \nWhen the Sieberg (1923) scale was translated into English, with some changes, \nby Wood and Neumann (1931), while acknowledging the work of Sieberg in the \ntext of their paper, in the title they picked out Mercalli and dropped Cancani and \nSieberg, and the result was the Modified Mercalli Scale of 1931. Davison (1933) \nis more accurate in referring to this as the Wood-Neumann Scale.  In the \n 8\ncondensation of Sieberg\u2019s text, much helpful detail is lost, and Wood and \nNeumann\u2019s version is not an improvement. Where Sieberg (1923) has  \n\u2026 Plants, the branches and weaker boughs of shrubs and trees sway \nvisibly, as they do with a moderate wind. Freely hanging objects, such as \ncurtains and lamps, but not heavy chandeliers, oscillate \u2026 \nWood and Neumann (1931) have \nHanging objects \u2026 swing generally or considerably \u2026 Trees , bushes, \nshaken slightly. \nThe former is more vivid and clearer. \nProblems of nomenclature became more acute 25 years later, when the scale \nwas completely overhauled by Richter (1958). Richter\u2019s changes were far \nreaching \u2013 in particular, he introduced a series of building classes based on \ntypology, facilitating the assessment of intensity in cases where weak buildings \nare damaged but strong ones are not. This resulted again in a quite new scale, \nwhich, Richter realised, should be called the Richter Scale. However, by historical \naccident, the phrase \u201cRichter Scale\u201d was already in wide journalistic use for the \nlocal magnitude (ML) scale, and Richter correctly foresaw that having an intensity \nscale called after him would cause immense confusion. He therefore proposed \nthat the scale be referred to as the Modified Mercalli Scale of 1956. \nThis proved a bad decision; it would have been better to call it something like the \n\u201cCalifornia Scale\u201d. What happened was that thereafter intensity data sets \nappeared with the intensity given only as \u201cModified Mercalli\u201d (or MM or MMI) with \nno indication of which scale was intended. To make matters even worse, \nsubsequent authors followed the same course in producing further scales, and \nthere is now a multiplicity of different scales calling themselves \u201cModified \nMercalli\u201d of one version or another, some of which are clearly not compatible with \neither the 1931 or 1956 scales (for instance, the version by Brazee 1978). As a \n 9\nresult, in many papers it is hard to know exactly what is meant when \u201cMMI\u201d \nappears.  \nThe latest version of \u201cModified Mercalli\u201d appears to be that of Stover and Coffman \n(1993). One of the changes of this version is to downgrade damage to a few \nchimneys from intensity 7 to intensity 6. \nOne also notes a carelessness in some authors, especially on the internet, in \ndropping the \u201cModified\u201d and referring to the \u201cMercalli Intensity Scale\u201d as if the \n1902 version were still in use. This practice, justified by those who perpetrate it \non the grounds of \u201cease of use\u201d, seems sometimes to stem from an ignorance \nthat different scales exist.  \nIn a parallel development, a new twelve-degree scale was created in 1962 by \nMedvedev, Sponheuer and K\u00e1rn\u00edk, published as the MSK scale (Medvedev et al. \n1964). This was broadly based on MCS, Wood and Neumann and Richter\u2019s work, \nand a previous scale by Medvedev, but arranged in a more systematic way. It \nwas widely adopted in Europe.  \nIn 1988 it was resolved by the European Seismological Commission to bring the \nMSK scale in line with modern building types and advances in macroseismology. \nThe result was a new scale, called the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS) \npublished in Gr\u00fcnthal (1998). \nScales in the non-Cancani group can be divided into three categories: \n(i) Old scales predating 1904 e.g. Mercalli (1883). \n(ii) Scales descended from the seven-degree scale of Omori (1900). \n(iii) Later scales deliberately different from the Cancani family. \nThe second category comprises the different versions of the JMA Scale \n(Japanese Meteorological Agency). The most recent version of 1996 has \nincreased the number of degrees from seven to nine, by dividing intensity 5 into \n 10\n\u201c5 upper\u201d and \u201c5 lower\u201d and similarly for intensity 6 (JMA 1996). Present use of \nthe JMA Scale is made by converting instrumental ground motion parameters into \npseudo-intensity values (Yamazaki et al 1998); so one has no idea whether a \nquoted intensity value for a modern Japanese earthquake actually corresponded \nto the description of effects for that degree of the scale being observed or not. \nThe replacement of the original JMA Scale with its instrumental version means \nthat, to all intents and purposes, macroseismology is no longer practiced in \nJapan. Intensity is by definition a classification of observed effects. With \nearthquakes in Japan before 1996, the isoseismal 5 JMA marked the boundary of \nthe area of observed damage to property. With later earthquakes, intensity 5 JMA \nindicates only a physical ground motion believed to be sufficient to cause \ndamage to houses. Whether or not damage actually occurred is unknown.  \nScales in the third category are uncommon, but a fine example is found in \nAmbraseys and Melville (1982). This scale, intended for use for historical \nearthquakes in Iran, has five degrees. These are deliberately arranged so that \nintensity 1 is the most damaging and 5 the least; the inverse order to most other \nscales. This emphasises that the scale is intended to be unique to the matter in \nhand (historical Iranian sources) and not an alias or simplification for MSK or \nMMI. \nConversion between intensity scales \nHow can one convert between intensity scales? In the case of scalar parameters \nlike magnitude, it is at least possible to regress one scale against another and \nproduce a conversion formula that can then be applied to a given data set, to \ninfer, say, Mw from Ms or vice versa. However, intensity is not a scalar; it is a \nclassification according to the nature of effects. This is often expressed by the \npractice of writing intensities in Roman numerals to emphasise that these are \nintegers and indivisible. (The practice of adding decimals in Arabic numerals after \n 11\nan intensity written in Roman numerals has, however, been seen \u2013 Kl\u00fcgel 2005 is \nan example.) The modern tendency is to write intensities with Arabic numerals as \nthese are easier to handle in a computer file, but they are none the less integer \nclasses. (There would be some justification in replacing the numbers in an \nintensity scale with letters: intensity A-L in a twelve degree scale. It should also \nbe mentioned in passing that these strictures apply to intensity assessed from \nobservations, and not necessarily to predicted intensity inferred from models.) \nIdeally, conversion should not be done at all; the correct and best procedure is to \nreturn to the original data and reassign values in the desired intensity scale \n(Ambraseys et al 1983, Gr\u00fcnthal 1998 \u2013 see especially section 4.3). This is \nfrequently very difficult or impossible, either because the original data no longer \nexist, or because of practical constraints of time and effort. In such cases some \nform of conversion is necessary, although it will add extra uncertainty to the final \nvalues.  \nOne sometimes sees conversion diagrams in which different scales are \nrepresented as a series of blocks (one per degree of the scale) of different \nwidths. One scale will be taken as a standard, and the width and placing of \nblocks in the other scales will vary according to the perceived relationship \nbetween the scales. Figure 1 illustrates the type of scheme (this one is imaginary, \nbut real examples are found, for example, in Murphy and O\u2019Brien 1977, Krinitzsky \nand Chang 1988, Reiter 1990 and Guidoboni and Ebel 2009). In it, one is led to \ninfer that intensity 5 in scale A is slightly higher than intensity 5 in scale B, \npresumably because some diagnostics for intensity 5 in scale B appear in the \ndescription of intensity 4 in intensity scale A, and some diagnostics for intensity 6 \nin scale B appear under 5 in scale A. Figures of this type express something of \nthe spread of correspondences between two scales in the eyes of an author, but \ndo not provide direct practical guidance. When dealing with integer classes, there \n 12\nis no \u201cslightly higher\u201d, and  Figure 1 would not provide one with a clear means \nconverting a data set. \nA possible application of the approach would be in cases of this sort: imagine that \nfor some earthquake the only information available for Derby was the following \n(imaginary) report: \nIn every place, the earthquake was generally felt only by those indoors; \neven in Derby few of those who were in the street at the time noticed \nanything. \nNow, consider two intensity scales A and B, where the phrase \u201cFelt by few \npersons outdoors\u201d appears under intensity 4 in scale A, but under intensity 5 in \nscale B (leading to the sort of overlap shown in Figure 1). If one supposes that a \nseismologist would give an unqualified intensity assessment for Derby of 4 (scale \nA) or 5 (scale B) on the slender evidence above, then one can say that Figure 1 \nat least alerts one to the possibility that some values of 4 (scale A) are the \nequivalent of 5 (scale B). But one cannot know which, and one would hope \nanyway that one would not encounter firm, unqualified intensity assessments that \nrested on a single diagnostic in the way illustrated.  \nIf a practitioner is faced with the task of giving a value to a data point in scale A \nwhen all he has is a value in scale B, the question is whether he should assign \none value or another. He has to make a working decision, and from Figure 1 one \ncan read that intensity 5 B is broadly compatible with 5 A, and therefore one \nwould translate 5 B to 5 A if one had no other information. There may be a case \nwhere the two scales are so mismatched that (for instance) 5 B could be 4 A or 5 \nA with equal likelihood, and 4-5 A is the only answer. But slight overlaps are \nmostly of theoretical interest. A table of equivalence such as that in Willmore \n(1979) is more practical in giving direct numerical correspondences. The author \nof that table (N.V. Shebalin) leaves the reader in no doubt that if he wishes to \n 13\nconvert some data from MMI to MSK, where he has a value 5 MMI, his \nrecommended course of action is to write 5 MSK. \nOstensibly, it appears that there are two possible ways to arrive at such a \nconversion table \u2013 an empirical way and a theoretical way. The empirical way \nwould be to look at what intensities have been assigned to a body of data in \nscale A, compare with the intensities given to the same data using scale B, and \nexamining the results. The theoretical way is to compare the actual wording of \nthe scale degrees. \nIt might appear on the surface that the empirical approach is likely to be more \nrobust, but in practice this is not the case, especially not where all the scales to \nbe compared are within the Cancani family. The problems are as follows. Firstly, \nan experienced seismologist may develop a conception of the Platonic ideal for \neach intensity degree, and may then tend to assign intensities according to this \nideal irrespective of what the scale actually says. Consider the following \nillustration. Suppose a description reads as follows: \nIn Derby, all over the town, windows and doors rattled, crockery and other \nlight items were shaken and most people were awakened. \nNow we consider two imaginary intensity scales in the Cancani family. In scale A, \nintensity 4 is defined as follows: \nMany people indoors feel the earthquake. A few sleepers wake. Windows \nand doors rattle. \nScale B has the following definition: \nThe earthquake is felt generally indoors, and many or most are awakened. \nCrockery, windows, doors, etc are shaken perceptibly. \nWhat is the intensity in Derby in scale A and B? Clearly there is a good match for \nintensity 4 in both scales. In the case of scale B one would assign intensity 4 \n 14\nwithout hesitation. However, if one treats the definition in scale A literally, the \nintensity is actually higher than 4, because at intensity 4 only a few are awakened \nwhereas the report states that most were. So the literal-minded seismologist \nwould assess an intensity of 4-5 using scale A and 4 using scale B. However, the \nless-literally minded seismologist would reason as follows, when using scale A: \n\u201cThis is obviously intensity 4. I won\u2019t take into account the fact that scale A \nconsiders that only few should wake \u2013 if all the windows are rattling people will be \nwoken by the noise. Therefore I will assign intensity 4; there is no evidence the \nintensity was any higher.\u201d \nThis is perfectly good reasoning, but it erodes any distinction between the two \nscales as regards values. In fact (and this is an important point that will be \nreturned to later) the difference between scale A and B is not that intensity 4 is \n\u201cslightly higher\u201d in scale B, but in the fact that using scale B both imaginary \nseismologists arrive at the same value (4), whereas using scale A they arrive at \ndifferent values (4-5 and 4). As a general rule, differences between seismologists \nin assessing intensity with the same scale are greater than differences assessed \nby the same seismologist using different scales, for scales within the Cancani \nfamily. This can often be seen in comparing evaluations of historical earthquakes \nwhere the same earthquake data have been assessed by different authors; no \nspecific examples are cited here, as we do not wish to appear to highlight \nparticular instances, but wherever the same data have been assigned intensities \nby different workers, differences will appear. \nIn fact, this follows directly from the subjective element in the assessment of \nintensity. To say that not everyone will make the same intensity assignment to \nthe same data is a trivial observation. Thus, any empirical comparison of, say, \nMCS and EMS, could only be done on the basis of \u201cMCS assigned by Dr A\u201d \ncompared to \u201cEMS assigned by Dr B\u201d. MCS assigned by Dr C might be \nsystematically different, according to different working practices between A and \n 15\nC. For instance, Dr A might assume that any mention of damage guarantees an \nintensity of at least 7 MCS, while Dr C may be prone to assuming that isolated \nreports of damage refer to buildings in such poor condition that they can be \ndisregarded. This will lead to systematic differences in data sets even using the \nsame scale. Therefore the attempt to compare scales empirically for general \npurposes, is problematic.  \nWhat if the same seismologist attempts to assign intensities using two difference \nscales, to explore the differences that way (e.g. Neilson et al 1984)? If one treats \nthe wording of each degree very literally in order to wring out the maximum \ndifference, one ends up assessing intensity in an artificial way, since most \nexperienced seismologists would tend to interpret the scale in a freer way. If one \nuses the scales in a natural way, the seismologist\u2019s Platonic ideal for each \nintensity degree starts to have an effect, and any differences in the wording \nbetween two scales becomes eroded, as discussed above. One then tends to \nreach the conclusion that all scales in the Cancani family are largely equivalent.  \nThere are some exceptions to this where, even in scales within the same family, \nthere are some obvious and inescapable differences. For example, some twelve-\ndegree scales define intensity 1 as \u201cthe earthquake is not felt by anyone\u201d, and \nany positive observation, no matter how feeble, is at least intensity 2 (e.g. MSK). \nOthers (e.g. Brazee 1978) consider that one or two observers feeling the \nearthquake on upper floors is intensity 1. Thus an observation that is \nunambiguously intensity 1 on the Brazee scale is unambiguously 2 on the MSK \nscale. \nWhen comparing scales that are not related, however, the anchoring effect that \ncomes from familiarity with twelve-degree scales no longer has such an \ninfluence. If the fictitious description of effects in Derby given above is to be \nassessed in terms of the Mercalli (1883) scale, the seismologist must decide \nwhether it fits better to intensity 2: \n 16\nModerate, with general shaking of fastenings, chandelier-prisms, etc., and \nringing of some bells. \nOr intensity 3: \nStrong, more or less general ringing of bells, stopping of clocks, and \noscillation of lamps. \nAnd now having a feeling that the rattling of windows and doors \u201cought\u201d to be \nintensity 4 (at least in MMI or MSK or EMS) cannot influence the result. \nEmpirical conversion really requires a situation is where it is desired to translate a \nparticular data set from one scale to another, where the data set is based on a \nsingle set of working practices (usually meaning it was compiled by one \nseismologist over a period of time). One might perhaps find from observation \n(assuming the original data exist) that wherever this seismologist has assigned \n7 MCS, the correct EMS assessment appears to be 6 EMS. In that case, and for \nthis data set, one can conclude that 7 MCS = 6 EMS. But for other data sets \ncompiled using different working practices this might not necessarily hold, and \ngeneral empirical guidelines cannot be given. \nDeriving a theoretical conversion by direct comparison of the wording of the scale \ncould be done, as already suggested, by disassembling each intensity degree \ndescription into individual diagnostics, and then seeing where these fall with \nrespect to a different scale. Thus if one found that for intensity 4 in scale A there \nwere eight diagnostics, of which six were found repeated in scale B for intensity 4 \nand two under intensity 5, this would lead to the sort of comparison found in \nFigure 1. It doesn\u2019t answer the question of how significant the discrepancy is in \nterms of actual use.  \nA more practical approach is to imagine that the description in scale A is a report, \nand to attempt to assign an intensity to this report using scale B. To take the \ndefinition of intensity 3 in the first Mercalli scale as given above, and give the \n 17\nequivalence in EMS-98, one would imagine that a description of effects at some \nplace matched the Mercalli definition exactly. This could read, for instance,  \nIn Geneva, the shock was rather strong, and felt generally by those indoors, \nbut by few outside. Many sleepers were woken, and some persons were \nalarmed by the rattling of doors and ringing of bells. There was a rather \nlarge oscillation of suspended objects, and some clocks stopped. \nOne would have little hesitation in assessing 5 EMS. This can then be repeated \nin the same way for all intensity degrees, including those involving damage (with \nsome assumptions about likely vulnerability of buildings). In this way one can \narrive at a table of equivalence for Mercalli and EMS as shown in Table 1. \nThis process does involve some degree of subjectivity, but one can at least set \nout one\u2019s reasons for arriving at the decisions made. \nConversion of the major scales to EMS-98 \nFollowing in the manner of Table 1, in Table 2 the exercise is repeated for the \nmajor intensity scales encountered: Rossi-Forel, MCS, MM56, MSK and JMA \n(1996 version). In each case, each degree of the scale was rewritten as an \nimaginary news report and intensity assigned using EMS-98. These imaginary \nreports are not given here, but it is a trivial exercise to imagine each degree of a \ngiven scale rewritten in the style of a journalistic report (mostly a matter of \nchanging the present tense to the past tense).  This table is presented with some \ncautions: \n1) In the first case, it must be recognised that its use should be thought of as \na last resort, and that one should always attempt to reassign intensity \nvalues from the original data. At the very least, one should check \nconversions against original data if at all possible.  \n 18\n2) These are theoretical relationships. In practice, any intensity data set is a \nconflation of the scale and the working practices used to apply it. The \nrelationships in Table 2 are proposed guidelines, and should not be taken \nin a rigid and prescriptive way.  \n3) There might be a particular issue in the case of MCS. Experience seems \nto show that MCS intensity assignments are frequently higher than those \nin EMS for the same data, despite the fact that, assigning EMS intensities \nto the MCS scale descriptions themselves, generally leads to equality in \nour opinion. The difference may lie in the way in which the scale has been \ninterpreted; this point needs to be investigated further.  \n4) There is no practical value, as already stated, in conversions that portray \none scale as \u201cslightly higher\u201d than another. There is no \u201cslightly higher\u201d in \nan integer scale, so all conversions are given here in integers. \n5) Conversions tend to break down at the top end of any scale. Most scales \nhave a maximum degree which is defined, in some form of words, as \n\u201ceverything is destroyed\u201d. The meaning of this is ambiguous; it depends \non what existed beforehand. If buildings are sufficiently poor, complete \ndestruction may occur at an intensity well below the maximum \nconceivable earthquake shaking. In such cases, intensity scales saturate \nat what may be only around 9 EMS. This is a particular problem with the \nRF scale, which jumps from moderate damage at 9 RF to total ruin at \n10 RF. Nor does it help to add extra diagnostics not related to building \ndamage, such as large-scale changes in landscape. These effects are \noften related to fault rupture or secondary ground effects, and generally \ndon\u2019t help to define intensity degrees. Thus in Table 2, in most cases the \ntop degree of older scales is undefined in terms of EMS (but may be \npresumed to be high). The issue is not critical, as these top degrees are \nseldom, if ever, used in practice. \n 19\n6) A literal reading of MSK and EMS-98 might suggest some differences, \nespecially with regard to the occurrence of slight damage. In practice, \nexperienced users of the MSK scale were not treating it literally, but \nmaking mental adjustments to the wording of the scale in order to arrive at \nintensity assessments that were robust and consistent with the overall \npattern of the data (e.g. Burton et al 1984). One of the aims of the ESC \nWorking Group for the revision of the MSK scale was to bring the wording \nof the scale into line with what seismologists were already doing as best \npractice (Gr\u00fcnthal 1989). Thus whatever differences there might \napparently be in the wording of the scales, there should be no differences \nin MSK values and EMS values if the MSK values were correctly \nassigned. The greatest difference is likely to be that some MSK \nassessments that were given as split values due to uncertainty, e.g. 5-6 or \n6-7, in many cases can now be resolved to a single degree. Most \nassignments of 5-6 MSK are likely to be 5 EMS, and 6-7 MSK is most \nlikely to be 6 EMS. \n7) The JMA Scale presents particular problems. As mentioned previously, \nsince routine practice in Japan is to assign this from strong ground motion \nrecords, whether a JMA intensity value actually corresponds to any sort of \nobserved effect is unknown. The descriptive interpretations still exist, but \nthey are hard to interpret in terms of other scales because of significant \ndiscrepancies. According to the JMA scale, an intensity (3 JMA) where \nmost people feel the earthquake and some are frightened (5 EMS) is the \nthreshold at which objects begin to rattle slightly (4 EMS if not sometimes \n3 EMS). The JMA Scale is unusual in having a degree zero (not felt). In \nmost scales intensity 1 is not felt. \n 20\nThe evaluation of intensity scales \nIn this section of the paper we consider comparisons between scales in the \nsense of deciding whether one scale is better for use than another. Superficial \ncomparisons can be made between scales in the sense of whether one scale is \nlonger than another, has more degrees in it, is intended for use in one country or \nanother, and so on. But there are also features that one can find that make a \nscale actually more recommendable or less recommendable.  \nOne can, for example, discard from consideration what Davison (1921) refers to \nas \u201cpersonal scales\u201d which are completely subjective, such as the very early \nMacfarlane scale (Milne 1842) which was used by Peter Macfarlane to compare \nthe strengths of aftershocks of an earthquake on 23 October 1839. Rating the \nmainshock as 10, Macfarlane considered that if he thought a shock was half as \nstrong it rated 5, and so on. Obviously this was a scale that no-one else could \nuse. \nThe following are some criteria that need to be taken into consideration: \nApplicability \nA good scale should be easy to apply to many individual cases because the \ndefinitions are sufficiently copious to meet a range of different circumstances. If \nthe definitions are very short, with few diagnostics, it may be hard in some cases \nto match a description of effects to the scale. Thus if one had a scale that \ncontained only descriptions of effects indoors, one could not use it if all the data \nwere from observers outdoors.  \nA specific problem is posed by the assessment of intensity for modern buildings \nthat have earthquake-resistant design. For the same degree of shaking, these \nbuildings should show less damage than older types of building. Thus, a scale \nthat takes into account modern building types is likely to be more useful than a \n 21\nscale written to deal only with the building types that were prevalent fifty years \nago. \nHowever, the applicability issue does not translate simply into \u201cmore diagnostics \nequals a better scale\u201d, as increasing the length of each description causes one to \nrun the risk of two pitfalls, as follows. \nConsistency \nThe first pitfall is the issue of consistency. Are all the diagnostics for a given \nintensity really equivalent to the same degree of shaking? If a scale yokes \ntogether two diagnostics in the same degree that actually occur at different \nstrengths of shaking, this will cause uncertainties in the application of the scale.  \nThis was a particular fixation of Davison\u2019s, as he makes very clear in his 1921 \nreview. In the scale he devised for his own use, each intensity degree has one \ndiagnostic only, so he could be sure that each degree was internally consistent \n(Davison 1900). Of course, this extreme solution meant that the scale was often \nimpossible to apply. \nA novel approach was pursued by Brazee (1978), who attempted to determine \nempirically from a large data set which diagnostic should be associated with \nwhich, using distance as discriminant. It is not really apparent that the results of \nthis experiment are any better than other scales where the arrangement was \nmade using judgement, and the scale has not been widely adopted. \nDiscrimination \nThis is an issue similar to that of consistency. Whereas the previous paragraphs \ndealt with the question that a diagnostic might be in the wrong place in the scale, \nthe discrimination problem relates to cases where a diagnostic does not relate \nuniquely to any degree of the scale, and is thus is not useful in establishing the \nlevel of intensity. In some cases, a diagnostic may not be properly an expression \n 22\nof intensity at all. This is an important issue, often not correctly appreciated, \nwhich requires particular consideration. It is important to understand that intensity \nis an expression of earthquake shaking, and therefore all diagnostics should refer \nto phenomena that are the direct result of earthquake shaking. It is not just a \ncollection of earthquake-related effects, and not all effects produced by an \nearthquake are suitable to be put into an intensity scale. For intensity to be useful \nas a concept, there must be an evident relationship between effect A and \nintensity Y, such that the observation of A occurring is evidence that the intensity \nwas at least Y, and also that the observation that A did not occur is evidence that \nthe intensity was less than Y. If effect A occurs at any intensity, it is not useful to \nhave it in an intensity scale. Equally, if the absence of A (even if the required \nsensor is present) is unrelated to intensity, then A does not belong in an intensity \nscale. \nAs a very clear example, it is notable that very few intensity scales ever include \nremarks about human casualties, and with good reason (an exception is found in \nPrincipia 1982). Clearly, many other factors, like time of day, control the number \nof observed fatalities. One could, however, find a correlation between fatalities \nand intensity at least to the extent that many deaths usually indicate a high \nintensity. However, the absence of many deaths may mean only that people were \nout in the fields.  \nDirect fault rupture effects are a similar case. Absence of rupturing effects has to \ndo with the characteristics of the fault (including its depth), and has nothing to do \nwith shaking or intensity. Ground rupture, and effects contingent on it, thus have \nno place in an intensity scale. They may correlate with intensity (because \ntypically the intensity will be high where the fault breaks) but they are not \nexpressions of it. The fact that phenomena related to ground rupture were \nsometimes incorporated into earlier intensity scales, does not mean that this was \never good practice. A common example relates to the bending of railway lines, \n 23\nwhich first appears in Omori (1900) for intensity 6. Clearly, shaking of itself, no \nmatter how strong, does not cause steel rails to bend. This is a secondary effect \ndue to either fault displacement or ground failure. \nAlthough effects on nature can be used, with great care, as reinforcing evidence \nof the level of intensity, it is not possible to rely on them exclusively. This has \nbeen pointed out several times (e.g. Vogt et al 1994, Musson et al 1995). The \nuse  of effects of nature has been encouraged by some authors on the grounds \nthat otherwise, intensity values cannot be assigned at all in uninhabited areas \n(Dengler and McPherson 1993, Serva 1994). This is a problem one has to live \nwith; neither can one assign intensities in the sea. It is better to leave \nmountainous areas as blanks on the map than to fill them with unreliable intensity \nvalues that may not actually show strength of shaking. \nIn conclusion, \u201capplicability\u201d is not always an advantage if the scale is written in \nsuch a way that real problems are concealed. The fact that a particular scale is \nwritten in such a way that using it, one can reach an intensity assignment for a \nplace that might not be possible with a different scale, is not necessarily an \nadvantage. The numbers may not be meaningful. \nNumber of degrees \nThe resolving power of an intensity scale is obviously related to the number of \ndegrees in the scale. Montessus de Ballore was sceptical of intensity scales and \nremarked once that the only true scale would be one with two degrees \u2013 felt and \nnot felt (Ballore 1916). One could obtain only very limited information using a \nscale at such an extreme position in the continuum between the rudimentary and \nthe sophisticated. However, the extent to which one can resolve intensity degrees \ndepends on two things: firstly, the quality of the data, and secondly, a certain \nirreducible chaos in even the most detailed macroseismic data set. \n 24\nIf the quality of data is not good, and this is especially true of historical data sets, \none cannot resolve intensities to the same fineness as may be defined in the \nscale. Thus, for a report, \u201cIn Verona many buildings were damaged,\u201d the intensity \nin a classic twelve-degree scale may be anywhere from 6 to 8. Thus a six-degree \nscale that runs: not felt \u2013 weak \u2013 moderate \u2013 strong \u2013 damaging \u2013 destructive, \nmay be as far as one can really discriminate (Musson 1991). On the other hand, \nwith detailed contemporary data sets, such a scale would be found limiting, which \nis why early scales with few degrees, like Mercalli\u2019s first scale, were phased out \nin favour of scales of first ten and then twelve degrees. \nHowever, even with a very detailed and copious data set, it will be found in \npractice that observations of earthquake shaking are somewhat irregular,  due to \nthe complexity and scattering of earthquake waves in the upper crust and soil \ncolumn. As a result, even with many detailed reports from each settlement, the \nseismologist may find it hard to decide if the intensity is one degree or another. \nAs a result, it seems to be the case that twelve degrees is really the limit for a \npractical working scale. Any more, and the increased fineness of resolution could \nnot actually be exploited using real data. This is a good reason for avoiding half \nintensity degrees, which would suppose that one could have a workable 23-\ndegree scale. \nIn fact, the top two intensities in a modern twelve-degree scale are used so \ninfrequently that they can be effectively dropped, as is current USGS practice \n(Wald 2006, pers. comm.), and has been proposed in New Zealand also (Dowrick \n1996). \nNormally, a collection of questionnaires from a place (including internet-submitted \nresponses) represents a very small and non-random sample of the total \npopulation. Inferences from such a sample as to the true intensity at the place \nmay be questionable even at the resolution of integer intensity values; thus \n 25\nresolving values down to fractional or decimal degrees is probably a case of \nspurious accuracy. Intensities assigned from questionnaire data may not even be \naccurate to a resolution of one degree of a twelve degree scale. (However, \nhypothetical intensity values predicted from attenuation models can validly be \nexpressed as decimals, as they don\u2019t reflect observational data.)  \nAn intensity scale is a practical instrument with an end in view, and the number of \ndegrees in any particular scale is likely to be a reflection of the purposes to which \nthat scale is intended to be put. Thus having more or fewer degrees is not \nnecessarily an advantage or disadvantage. It is no criticism of the scale in \nAmbraseys and Melville (1982) that it has only five degrees; that is a reflection of \nwhat can be discriminated using Persian historical records, and the scale does \nthe task for which it was constructed. \nRegularity \nDetermining correlations between intensity and simple measures of physical \nground motion has proved difficult in the past, and prone to large scatter (e.g. \nMurphy and O\u2019Brien 1977, Kaka and Atkinson 2004). Even though the concept of \nintensity is an integer classification, it is still to be hoped that intensity will behave \nmore or less as if it were a physical parameter, and decay smoothly with \ndistance. For this to be the case, the degrees of the scale need to be defined in \nsuch a way that the decrease in shaking with each lower value is regular. This \nshould be clear in intensity datapoint distributions or isoseismal maps. If \nisoseismal maps drawn using a particular scale consistently showed a narrow \ngap between isoseismals 4 and 5, compared to the gap between 3 and 4 and \nbetween 5 and 6, it would indicate that the scale was badly constructed (and \nsimilarly with intensity datapoint distributions).  \nFailure to find even spacing may reflect poor practice rather than poor scale \ndesign. A common observation is to see isoseismal maps in which the spacing of \n 26\nisoseismals 5 and 4 is very wide, and then the spacing suddenly drops below 4 \nso that isoseismals 4, 3 and 2 are very tightly spaced. The most obvious \nexplanation for this is poor practice in assigning intensity. If intensity values are \nassigned to individual questionnaires, instead of to communities on the basis of \nseveral questionnaires, then isolated returns that answer \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cDid windows \nrattle?\u201d will be rated 4. This can result in a whole settlement being assigned \nintensity 4 on the basis of one observer with loose windows.  \nIn general, the twelve-degree family of scales do a good job at preserving regular \nspacing when properly applied, which is one reason why the outline of the \ndifferent degrees has been more or less stable for a hundred years. A common \ncomplaint that used to be addressed to the MSK scale was that there was a \nmissing degree between 6 and 7. This subject was investigated by the European \nSeismological Commission Working Group (WG) \u201cMacroseismic Scales\u201d \n(Gr\u00fcnthal 1993, 1998) in the course of revising the MSK scale to create EMS, \nwith the conclusion that no new degree is necessary. Nor, for that matter, would \nsuch a new degree be advisable, as it would break up the existing regularity.  \nThe RF Scale is a good example of a scale with regularity problems, especially in \nthe jump between 9 and 10 RF. This has been noted before, e.g. by Wood and \nNeumann (1931). \nReliability \nIf, as is argued above, all the Cancani-family scales are more or less equivalent \nin values, it might be wondered why any one should be preferable to any other. \nThe key element in preferring one scale over another is the consistency with \nwhich the scale guides the user to the correct assignment for any place. As is \nwell known, macroseismology contains an element of subjectivity, so that given \nthe same data, two seismologists may assign different intensity values. Usually \nthese differences are minor: one worker may assess 4-5 (4 or 5) where another is \n 27\nmore certain that the value is 4. All the same, anything that reduces subjectivity \n(or errors) is welcome. Thus, if two workers using scale A produce assessments \nof intensity that sometimes differ by up to two degrees, but when using scale B \nproduce assessments that always agree, then, other things being equal, scale B \nis better. \nTo some extent, reliability is a function of other factors already discussed. So, for \ninstance, a scale that has consistency problems is likely to cause users to come \nto different assignments, as each user has to find his way over the obstacle. \nAnother issue here is that the variability of earthquake effects in a given place \nmeans that a probabilistic approach, especially to damage, is advantageous. If a \nscale simply states that for a certain intensity, \u201cchimneys are broken off at the \nroof line\u201d, users may react differently in cases where few or many, but not all \nchimneys are so affected. If a scale defines expected distributions of effects, \nrather than just the effects in isolation, it becomes easier to recognise the correct \nintensity assignment. This was a considerable advance in macroseismology, \nwhich came in really with the first version of the MSK scale in 1964. \nOne of the problems in the past that has led to inconsistent practices has been \nthe fact that most scales have been published as lists of definitions without any \ncorresponding guidance as to how the authors of the scale envisaged it being \napplied. A practice which has often been decried (rightly) in the past is that of \nassigning intensity on the basis of the highest effect reported. While this is \nundoubtedly wrong, one must have some sympathy for the observatory assistant \nwho has been given a single sheet of paper with the Rossi-Forel Scale written on \nit, and told to start assigning intensities. For this reason, one of the first decisions \ntaken by the ESC WG in revising the MSK scale was that the new scale should \nbe accompanied by clear instructions as to exactly how the scale should be \ninterpreted and applied. For this reason, EMS-98 is not simply a sheet of \ndefinitions, but  includes guidelines intended to reduce misapplication. \n 28\nThis discussion is predicated, of course, on traditional assessment of intensity \nfrom data by human judgement. This is bypassed when automatic algorithms are \nused to assess data using completely formulaic methods (e.g. Wald et al 1999, \nMusson 2006), but the traditional application of intensity scales will always be an \nissue in the assessment of historical data sets. \nConclusions \nIn an ideal world, one should not attempt to make conversions between different \nintensity scales, but rather re-assess data using the scale that one wishes to \nhave the data expressed in. In practice, this may not always be possible, and \nconversion tables need to be applied. For practical purposes, the seismologist \nneeds to know, if he has something assessed as 6 in scale A, what he should \nwrite down for the value in scale B. \nMatters are complicated by the fact that, except where scales are radically \ndifferent in organisation or number of degrees, differences in practice between \nseismologists tend to outweigh differences between scales. Thus, a value of 6 in \nscale A may have one value in scale B if it was originally assigned by one worker, \nand another value if originally assigned by someone else. Hence the advantage \nin going back to the original data. \nTo improve the usability of past data, we have included here a table intended to \ngive guidance in converting data sets to EMS-98, but because of the way that \nany existing data set depends on working practices as well as the scale used, \nTable 2 should be used with care, and checks made if at all possible. Conversion \nin this manner should only be used where absolutely necessary; it would not be \ngood practice to regard this table as a future panacea, such that old scales could \ncontinue to be used and then converted as required. This table is essentially the \nauthors\u2019 assessments, in EMS-98, of imaginary press reports exactly expressing \nthe descriptions of the various intensities in other scales. It is not, and cannot be, \n 29\nbased on empirical analysis of data sets, because such an analysis would only \nbe valid with respect to the agencies who produced those particular data sets. \nNot all scales are equal; some are better than others. In particular, those that \nreduce disagreements between workers are better scales for everyday use. A \ngood scale should guide everyone to making the correct judgement, and should \nminimise the degree of subjectivity. This means making sure that the definitions \nof each intensity degree are internally consistent in describing things that do go \ntogether with the same degree of shaking. While it is an advantage for a scale to \ndeal with as many diagnostics as possible, it is not an advantage to include a \ndiagnostic that is not reliably associated with any intensity degree. There is thus a \ntrade-off between a scale that can be applied in very many cases to arrive at a \nnumber (but often the wrong one) and a scale which is less easy to apply in some \ncases (but gives more dependable answers). \nA strong way to reduce disparate intensity assignments between workers is to \nhave a scale that not only contains definitions of the various intensity degrees, \nbut gives specific guidance as to how these definitions should be interpreted and \nused.
