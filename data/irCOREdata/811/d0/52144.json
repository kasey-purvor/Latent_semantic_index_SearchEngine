Thus \nit tries to achieve that force should appear to be supported by the agreement \nof the majority, expressed by the so-called organs of public opinion- \n                                             \n1 This article is work in progress for the British side of an Economic and Social \nScience Research Council (ESRC) funded small research grant \u2018Women, \nPress & Protest in British and French India, 1928-48\u2019. With thanks to ESRC \nand to Macquarie University. \n \n \n \nFormatted: Font: Arial, 12 pt,\nItalic\nFormatted: Font: Arial, 12 pt\nFormatted: Font: Arial, 12 pt\nDeleted: .\n 2 \nnewspapers and associations (Gramsci, Quaderni del Carcere, p.1638, cited \nin Joll 1977: 99).i  \n \nSince Gramsci\u2019s time, scholars have argued that if there is hegemony, then \nthere can also be counter-hegemony. The concept was first developed - in \nterms of definitions of modernity - by structuralist philosophers such as Louis \nAlthusser (1969), Theodor Adorno (trans. 1997 from 1970, (7)), subsequently \ncritiqued by the post-structuralists Marshall Berman (1983), and Jacques \nDerrida (1992), and has been widely discussed within journalism history by \nscholars in relation to minority communication (Downing 1984, 2001); \nMurdock, 2000; Cottle, 2000; Chapman 2007).  Using the North Indian \nEnglish-language Pioneer as the main  archive, this paper looks at articles on \nand about women's activism from 1928-1934 in order to address a practical \nissue for counter-hegemony in newspapers: how far it was possible for an \nestablishment paper to entertain dissent within its pages, in particular the \nvoice of indigenous, female supports of the \u2018freedom movement \u2019? \n  \nAlthough coverage of female protest can be found to a greater or lesser \nextent in most of the other English language press, The Pioneer was chosen \nbecause as a newspaper business, it manifested change during a specific \ntime frame. By 1928 the paper was produced by a handful of staff, circulation \nwas in decline and advertising revenue in need of a boost. At this time \nconstitutional talks were reaching a crucial stage against a backdrop of the \nnon-cooperation and civil disobedience movements, and the then British \nowners were prompted by the existing editorial staff themselves to beef up the \n 3 \nmanagerial team by appointing a new editor, F.W.Wilson, to improve the \npaper\u2019s fortunes. He did so by exhibiting liberal sympathies towards the \nnationalist movement, in the hope of increasing Indian readership.  \n \nWilson\u2019s progressive experiment lasted less than two years, and was followed \nby a move of headquarters to Lucknow in 1933, and sale of the paper to a \nCawnpore business group of Indian princes in 1934. The paper then reverted \nto a more conservative stance. Jawaharlal Nehru recognised this period of \ntemporary flirtation with liberalism, selected as the time frame for analysis \nhere, when he wrote: \u2018For a while it was a live paper, the most readable in \nIndia. It amused or pleased or irritated or angered, but it was not dull. And \nnow that Mr Wilson has left it, it has gone back to its old rut, and lest its \nhapless readers may be unable to find out what it is or what it stands for, it \nreminds them daily of \u201claw and order.\u201d \u2019 (Wilson,1929 vi-vii). Law and order \nnotwithstanding, the episode raises bigger questions about the dilemmas of \nhegemonic editorial expression during the transition from Empire to an \nindependent India.  \n \n\u2018FW\u2019 as he was referred to, gave cautious support to Dominion Status and for \nwomen\u2019s rights, whilst also attempting to \u2018Indianise\u2019 the editorial staff and \nintroduce a modern editorial style. (Rao 1965) He campaigned against the all-\nwhite Simon Commission imposed by the Tory government and gained \napproving public mentions from Motilal Nehru as a result. (Pioneer April 15 \n1928,1) In 1929 Wilson wrote in an editorial called \u2018the Awakening of Indian \nWomen\u2019: \u2018Probably in no country in the world is it so necessary for women to \n 4 \ntake a prominent part in social and political life than in India\u2019 and that \u2018every \nencouragement should be given to the emancipation of the sex and to all \nattempts to give women their proper place in the body politic\u2019 (Pioneer \nJanuary13th:12).  \n \nWilson was close to both Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, who lived in \nAllahabad, and it was Jawaharlal Nehru who commented about protest during \nthis period: \u2018Here were these women, women of the upper or middle classes, \nleading sheltered lives in their homes \u2013 peasant women, working-class \nwomen \u2013 pouring out in their tens of thousands in defiance of government \norder and police lathi. It was not only that display of courage and daring, but \nwhat was even more surprising was the organisational power they showed\u2019 \n(1946:23). This new role for women has been acknowledged by historians: \n\u2018Politics completely altered the goals and activities of organized women. \nEducation, social reform and women\u2019s rights appealed to some progressive \nwomen, but the movement to rid the country of its foreign rulers attracted \npeople from all classes, communities and ideological persuasions\u2019 \n(Forbes,1996;121). So did women, through their actions, speak in the pages \nof Wilson\u2019s paper? This article uses empirical quantitative and qualitative \nmethods to examine evidence of the counter hegemonic voice.  \n \nLiterature Review \nThe press as agency between coloniser and colonised is insufficiently studied, \nand only serves to problematise some of the seminal binary analyses of \nclassic post-colonial theorists such as Edward Said \u2013in particular his \n 5 \ncontention that understanding of the Orient and hence of the \u2018other\u2019 is always \nseen through the lens of the colonial power (1978). Information in The Pioneer \nand other Anglo Indian newspapers was not always subsumed into the \ncolonising \u2018self\u2019: The Pioneer featured articles by Indian contributors and \ncolumnists (including prominent political women such as Annie Besant) with \ntheir own bylines, according to our content analysis. Thus, depending on the \ndefinition of \u2018subaltern\u2019 in Spivak\u2019s much quoted theorisation (1993), the \n\u2018subaltern\u2019 could \u2013 and did - \u2018speak\u2019. Scholars such as Howard Spodek (2010) \nhave suggested that \"all women\" could be considered \"subalterns,\" but \nmembers of the Subaltern Collective have defined women subalterns in terms \nof class and caste. Most of the women mentioned in this article belonged to \nthe highest castes and highest class of their region, and were often privileged \nby Western education and in many cases by experiences abroad. They \nbecame the mouthpieces in The Pioneer of rural women and labourers who \njoined nationalist protests.  \n \nDefinitions aside, more recently colonial discourse analysis has accepted that \nthe relationship between coloniser and colonised is more complex (Bhabha \n1983), with writers such as Suleri (1992) talking of an \u2018anxiety of empire\u2019 on \nthe part of the colonial power \u2013 an anxiety that clearly emerges from Wilson\u2019s \neditorial stance. Similarly, Spurr (1993) in his study of colonial discourses \nwithin journalism, writes of contemporary \u2018instability\u2019 that is not just manifest in \ncolonial and post colonial divisions but is also evident within systems and \nwritings about them.  \n \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nDeleted: -\n 6 \nOur findings supplement academic attention on the way newspapers in \nmainland Britain reported matters relating to India (Kaul, 1999;2003) and an \nexisting focus on the rise of indigenous, nationalist newspapers within India \nthat challenged the hegemonic, English language, colonial owned press \n(Jeffrey, 2000; Murthy, 1966; Mazumbar, 1993). Indian press historians have \napproached nationalist coverage from the angle of the birth of their own \nvernacular newspapers rather than the demise of existing colonial ones such \nas The Pioneer. The parallel decline and consequential re-adjustment of \nexisting colonial newspapers in India to the ascent to power of the nationalist \nmovement has been overlooked.  \n \nThis may well be because, according to Jawaharlal Nehru, the Anglo- Indian \npress was an anomaly: \u2018Cut off entirely from the life of the people and living in \na world of its own, it has specialised in dullness and inanity\u2019 (Wilson 1929, vi \u2013 \nvii). Nevertheless, press censorship of Indian English language and \nvernacular newspapers, particularly from 1931 onwards, forced the nationalist \nmovement to seek more coverage in the colonial press \u2013 and with \nconsiderable success. There has been some research on censored material \nand issues of press freedom (Barrier, 1974); and Israel (1994) has looked at \nthe role of government, press and news agencies in the nationalist struggle in \nrelation to The Bombay Chronicle, but only briefly mentions The Pioneer. \n \nAlthough women\u2019s empire studies is a growing field of study (ed. Kleinberg, \n1988; ed. Midgley,1998; ed.

(Taneja, 2005; \ned.Mody, 2000; Jain, 1985; Jain & Mahan, 1996; Bakshi, 1994; Forbes, 1996; \nKumar, 1993); Wieringa, 1995; Mohanty, 1996; Kaur, 1969; Woollacott, 2006 ; \ned. Nanda, 1976)   \n \nPredictably, contemporary memoirs have their own agendas. Desmond \nYoung (1963), the former Pioneer editor who moved the headquarters to \nLucknow and negotiated for the paper\u2019s sale to a consortium of princes, seeks \nto justify his own role by dismissing Wilson\u2019s contribution (see later). In \ncontrast, Rao (1965), who worked under Wilson, is more complimentary about \nWilson\u2019s \u2018Indianisation\u2019 of the editorial team and the other changes to the \npaper\u2019s style. Press historian Natarajan (1962) remarks significantly that \nWilson had a \u2018close understanding\u2019 with Motilal Nehru at a time when Nehru\u2019s \ncommittee was drafting a constitution (Sethi1958; Spear 1981).  Was Wilson \naiming to fill the market gap left by the demise of Nehru\u2019s Independent in \n1923? Both The Pioneer and the Nehru family were based in Allahabad. \nWilson took the paper to the left of its main competitor, The Leader, already \nleft of centre in Anglo-Indian terms, but notably less lively in its coverage than \nthe new-style Pioneer.  \n \nAccording to Jawaharlal Nehru (1936, 2004), the freedom movement was \nunable to communicate publically at this time \u2013 presenting activists with a big \norganisational problem. The need for the nationalist movement to address this \nis articulated by Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya (1939) who connects public \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nDeleted: . This\nDeleted:  was the \n 8 \nawareness with the economic imperative and with a rationale for the political \nstrategy of nationalist protest. Clearly support for the nationalist cause - even \nlimited support - had economic implications, for as Jain (1985) has argued, \nnationalism for Gandhi was a social and economic programme, rather than \nsimply a political one. \n \nNews values  \nThe Pioneer\u2019s style of reporting was un-sensational, summing up the facts \nand presenting news in concise packages, augmented with direct speech. \nSometimes court reports and accounts of women\u2019s conferences were covered \nverbatim. Significant technical improvements in the printing capability of the \nnewspaper during Wilson\u2019s tenure facilitated the publication of a greater \nnumber of photographs, beyond the confines of the traditional pictures page.  \nMore photographs of Indians began to appear with a marked increase in the \nfrequency that female activists\u2019 photographs appeared in the paper: for \nexample, The Pioneer carried a photo of Annie Besant on 6th Jan 1930 and \nthe front page for 10 September 1928 displayed a portrait of Sarojini Naidu, a \nfemale leader of the Congress and a noted poet, departing for a European \ntour,  \n \nThe Pioneer was constructed of 24 pages, with the first 4 pages consisting of \nnews, summary editorial and news in brief. Court reporting dominated pages \n5-6; pages 7-9 covered overseas news and some political comment;  the \noccasional \u2018Women\u2019s Topics\u2019 column was located on pages 10-11 \u2013otherwise \nthis space was reserved for book reviews. Although circa 90 per cent of the \nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 9 \npaper reported news, political, judicial, sporting and economic affairs deemed \nto be of interest to the imperialist male, the rest of the paper focused on \nwomen. Pages 12 to 24 comprised of editorial and letters, sporting events and \nresults, local market and share reports, commentary on global markets, and \nclassified advertising. Display advertisements were located on almost every \npage, mostly for cars, alcohol, guns and machinery, with a few promoting \ntoiletries and medication for women.  \n \nBy 1928 The Pioneer\u2019s circulation was in decline and advertising revenue in \nneed of a boost. During Wilson\u2019s tenure The Pioneer moved offices in London \n(to The Aldwych) and procured new rotary printers for India - capable of \nproducing 36,000 twenty four page editions per hour. He encouraged \nadvertisers to take advantage of the broader demographic of this \u2019modern\u2019 \npaper, highlighting the \u2018advertisers\u2019 opportunity\u2019 to utilise these machines to \nprovide 'greatly enhanced value' for The Pioneer in order to reach its wider \nreadership \u2018from the Viceroy to the humble inhabitants of the bazaar\u2019. Such \npeople, he claimed, were able to afford the one anna paper after he reduced \nthe sales price (Wilson, 1929 The Pioneer  1 October:1).  \n \nIt is interesting that reports of the nationalist and women's struggle for \nindependence were embedded in a framework of advertising that supported \nthe hegemonic status quo. Wilson wanted  the paper to be increasingly  \nreactive to local events in order to make it more attractive to local advertisers \n\u2013 also a logical strategy due to the fact that United Province, as one of the \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nDeleted: as well \nDeleted:  1st\n 10 \nmain centres of nationalist protest, and the venue chosen by the Congress \nParty to launch the \u2018no rents\u2019 campaign, was a \u2018hard news\u2019 region.   \n \nAlthough professional news values demanded objectivity in the presentation \nof facts, editors who gave coverage to anti-colonial events were providing a \nwindow for nationalist communication, however narrow. By 1928, the activities \nof the nationalist movement were wide ranging, so to some extent, there was \na choice in terms of editorial priorities for coverage, such as the positioning of \na story within the paper, the size and nature of the headline, and the number \nof column inches allocated to it. The Pioneer had its preferences, like any \nother paper. Wilson drew the line at supporting violence- although perceptions \nof what sells newspapers (new values) and professional journalistic \n\u2018objectivity\u2019 dictated that the paper would still cover it. Conversely, he favoured \neducation and self-improvement for women and gave a platform to some \nIndian female writers (see later). \n \nFemale protest may well have assumed a high priority in Wilson\u2019s editorial \nthinking because of the British elections on 30th May 1929, when three times \nas many women as men voted (Pioneer 1st June,1929 :3). The voting age in \nBritain was reduced from 30 years of age to 21, resulting in an increase of 5 \nmillion new female voters. This had an impact on public debate in India, as   \n\u2018The Awakening of Indian Women\u2019 by Wilson noted: \u2018recent \nconferences...dealing more particularly with subjects primarily affecting \nwomen ...have shown that there is a new spirit abroad  ...and that, side by \nside with the wider political movement towards Swaraj, there will exist a \n 11 \nparallel series of movements, without which any serious attempt at self-\ngovernment will be doomed\u2019 (Pioneer 1929 Jan 13:12, 1-2). Thus, in the \ncontext of general interest in female citizenship, global campaigns were also \nreported in The Pioneer: Millicent Fawcett visited Ceylon, Lady Irwin \ncampaigned on Indian women's behalf back in London, Sarajini Naidu did a \npromotional tour of the US. Similarly, in \u2018The Rights of Women -Plea for a \nChanged Outlook\u2019 Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya (who also travelled abroad as \na representative of Indian women at international conferences) argued that \nthe \u2018Women's Movement was one of the greatest forces in the world today \nand one of the factors shaping the life of humanity all over the world (Pioneer \n1929 Jan 14: 4, col 4). Subsequent editors Thorniley then Young continued to \nreport women\u2019s campaigns.  \n \nYet female direct action in the form of boycotts, pickets, burning of cloth, and \nother forms of civil disobedience presented a dilemma. First, there was the \nquestion of appearing to condone violence; second the issue of giving \npublicity to illegal activities \u2013 for this could damage morale and British \nconfidence; and third there was the question of economic damage to both The \nPioneer \u2018s revenue if advertisers withdrew support and the danger of the \npaper being accused of contributing to the damage that British business was \nalready suffering.  \n \nMethodology and Research \nIn terms of research design, it was therefore logical to differentiate between \ndifferent sorts of coverage. Thus, researchers created two data sets: one for \n 12 \npeaceful self-emancipation, such as education and conferences and one for \ndirect action, sometimes but not always violent and \/or illegal. The first \ncategory was important for the emerging citizenship of women, as well as in \nterms of social reform. The second reflects the interface of economics with \nideology in the press, for it brought women into the public sphere with an \norganisational and collective consciousness, reflected for instance, in trade \nunion activities, and politically motivated economic boycotts.  \n    \nQualitative interpretative content analysis, combined with quantitative \nmethods and descriptive statistics of nominal and ordinal data from \nadvertising records of The Pioneer have been used.  The primary source \nmaterial was arranged into 2 major sets of data, analysing actual content \nabout women and protest over 100 per cent of the 600 issues covering \nJanuary 1928 to January 1930 -encompassing Wilson and Thorniley\u2019s \neditorships. Peaceful democratic conferences and other meetings account for \n78 per cent of political coverage on women and examples of direct action \nsuch as strikes, hartals, boycotts and cloth burning account for the remaining \n22 per cent.  Furthermore,  records of amalgamated trade figures and  tax \nrevenues provide supporting evidence of severe economic difficulties faced by \nthe Indian cotton trade due to strikes, boycotts and foreign cloth burnings. \nResearchers also looked at The Pioneer in January 1934 after editor Young \nmoved the paper to Lucknow and brokered the purchase deal with a \nconsortium of Indian princes.   \n \n \n 13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 \n \nTable 1 Pioneer\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s protest 1928-1930  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \n \nIt is important to differentiate on the one hand between a newspaper speaking \n\u2018for\u2019 women - that is on behalf of the colonial \u2018other\u2019 as framing - and on the \nother hand direct reporting - where a newspaper includes quotes from \nprotagonists, or the protagonists themselves actually contribute articles \ndirectly to the newspaper. Therefore the data was also tabulated to show \npercentages of articles on women divided into framed reporting of their \nactivities or use of direct quotes\/writing from the women themselves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 \n \nTable 2.

The 1929  \nfigures establish a 60 per cent  increase from 1928 in  reports supporting \nwomen\u2019s suffrage \u2013 in particular January to March that year, in anticipation of \nstrong female voting in London (Pioneer 1st June, 1929 :3).  \n \nFrom November 1928 to February 1929 there was an increase of 30 per cent \nin the reporting of female conferences, similar events and speeches calling \nsocial and political for reforms. Women used the paper to announce events \norganised by Chattopadhyaya, the Nehrus, Dowager Maharani of Mandi and \nothers, that were subsequently reported at length. Chattopadhyaya, Sarojini \nNaidu, Onila Chatterjee, Mandi, Maharani Sahiba of Lahore and Mrs M Nehru \nalso wrote articles in the paper with bi-lines, thus appealing directly to the \nreadership. There were even debates in the paper between leading women: \nfeminist Eleanor Rathbone, for instance, accused Miss Mayo of slandering \n\u2018Mother India\u2019 and not giving a true picture of national life- prompting an \neditorial in the same edition on her views (Jan 18th, 1929, p.10 and p.12) \n \nBefore the 1920s Spivak\u2019s assertion that an imperialistic and paternalistic \nhegemony would speak for women is largely accurate. In its early years the \ncampaign to improve conditions for women that began with the United \nProvinces Social Conference (UPSC) in the 1880s, was largely dominated by \n 18 \na colonialist determination to assign only a partial mandate for women. Yet by \nthe late 1920s a hardening of attitudes towards independence and the \nconstitutional form it should take provided a parallel impetus for women to act \nand speak for their own emancipation- now the conferences and their \nmandates were run by women themselves. In fact, in 1929 the UPSC\u2019s leader \nUma Nehru, in front of veteran campaigner Annie Besant ii, expressed her \nregrets that over a  40 year period there had been a  \u2018failure\u2019 to deal with \nwomen\u2019s issues at a communal level. She praised the All India Women\u2019s \nConference (AIWC, established 1926) for its success at a national level \n(Pioneer,April 3 1929:4). \n \nBy 1939 Chattopadhyaya was arguing that: 'in order to mobilise and harness \nthe mass energy to the anti-imperialist struggle there must be a political \nconsciousness in the masses' (1939:44).  By this she meant to use the press \nas a platform when she included it in her 10 point list for her anti-imperialism \nand, by association, women's emancipation (1939: 45).  The deliberations of \nsuch organisations, consistently reported in The Pioneer along with other \nmeetings and articles written by powerful women reflect a change in the way \nwomen organised, took part and voiced their concerns in Indian politics.  \nThus a combination of attempts at self-emancipation and newspaper \ncoverage amplified their voices.  \n \nThis redefining of the notion of female citizenship and the associated rights \nand responsibilities was symbolised by the appointment in 1925 of activist \nSarojini Naidu as the first female president of The Indian National Congress.  \n 19 \nBy 1929 the women\u2019s movement had gathered momentum: alongside the \nAIWC, the Women\u2019s Indian Association was overseen by Dr Muthulakshmi \nReddi, the first Indian female to be elected as a deputy president of a \nlegislative body. The Pioneer also reported on Allahabad Women\u2019s Meeting, \nGonda Ladies Conference, Indian Women\u2019s Education Conference, \nRajputana Conference, Delhi Women\u2019s Conference, Agra Province Education \nConference, All India Women\u2019s Movement, Women\u2019s Franchise Union, All \nIndia Moslem Ladies Conference, World Conference for Women, Women's \nInternational Congress, Women\u2019s Institute Movement, All India Congress, and \nWomen\u2019s Education Allahabad .  In fact, 71 per cent of reported meetings \nwere comprised of 18 separate organisations, and 29 per cent of them were \nAIWC.   \n \nOn  Dec 17 1928 (p11, col 1-2) the Maharani Sahiba of Lahore wrote a long \narticle, \u2018Emancipate Indian Women\u2019, about the urgent need for social reforms \nand education. She proposed that \u2018there is nothing that will help the Indian \nwoman to realise herself and make others realise her dignity, except the \nconsciousness that she is free and independent.\u2019iii The Pioneer also noted the \nincreasing interest of Muslim women in social parity:  (Pioneer 1928 June 18: \n17).  \n \nProbably the most controversial female contributor, best known for her \ngravitas but also her incisive and outspoken comments was Annie Besant. \nInitially she was sceptical about the chances of success for Gandhi\u2019s non-\ncooperation movement, calling his demand that the British government should \n 20 \naccept Dominion status in its entirety, or else the Congress would not pay \ntaxes, an \u2018insolent challenge\u2019 (30th Dec. 1928, p.1) and \u2018destructive\u2019 (Jan.11th, \np.9). She believed that this \u2018setback to political activity\u2019 would prove divisive \nfor Congress and that \u2018the masses would be the main sufferers of non-\ncooperation in a country like India where it could not be made effective\u2019. \nHowever, by May that same year she had become convinced of the success \nof the tactic, stating in The Pioneer on May 22nd that she was sure of India \nwinning home rule (p.3).  \n \nWomen and Direct Action \nGandhi\u2019s charisma attracted thousands of women to public life (Tomlinson \n1996:129; Forbes, 1996: 126; Jain 1985: 37) and his return to politics in 1928 \nsaw a change from 1920-1 Congress party non-cooperation, boycotting \nschools and law courts, to a more extensive form of civil disobedience.  \n \nFrom February to August 1928 Vallabhbai Patel and Gandhi reignited the land \nrent dissent campaign and specifically sought women\u2019s support. The Pioneer \nreported on 24 August female led land \u2018satyagrahis\u2019, in an article called \u2018Path \nof India's Deliverance\u2019. The article an earlier incident in 1921 at Bardoli -a land \ntax protest in Gujarat state iv. Wilson in particular was sympathetic to covering \nmass protests from poor men and women, often connecting past events with \ncontemporary protest, thus the paper ran a 3 part feature over 3 days, \u2018Bardoli \nand the Future\u2019. A correspondent covered a pilot protest over raised land rent \nwhere, on rent collection day villagers simply deserted their dwellings and ran \noff into the forest. The rent collectors could not identify the owners since there \n 21 \nwere neither people nor written evidence present to provide any sort of \nidentification, so they went away empty handed. \u2018Determined men and women \nhave seen the demonstration through\u2019 and [the] \u2018influence of the charka and \nlooms for weaving khaddar\u2019 and Gandhi-ism allowed them to protest at unfair \n\u2018enhancement\u2019 of land rent (Part II, Pioneer 1928, November 8:10). The \nprotest caught on and those who continued the action elsewhere were said to \nhave the \u2018Bardoli Spirit\u2019. (The Pioneer 1929, 10 January: 3) In terms of the \neconomic effects of such tactics, tax revenue figures for the period from 1921 \nto 1940 show a fall in land revenue from Rs 27m in 1921 to RS 23m in 1930, \ndecreasing further by 1940 to Rs19m. Similarly, customs revenue fell from Rs \n36m in 1930 to Rs 28m in 1940; and by 1946 salt tax had also declined to Rs \n2m from Rs 5m in 1930 (Tomlinson, 1993:150).  \n \nThe 42 (22 per cent of total) direct action articles during the period of our \nstudy are divided into 3 categories  of women\u2019s participation:  industrial strikes \n(50%); boycotts and hartals connected to the Simon Commission protests \n(17%), and open defiance linked to salt marches, land rent issues and foreign \ncloth burning (33%). The three most active peaks, July 1928, October 1928 \nand March 1929, are respectively linked to extensive coverage of women\u2019s \ninvolvement in mill strikes, Swaraj Day protests (10th March 1929) and the \nnon-cooperation and civil disobedience movements.  \n \nSimon Commission   \nThere was also much coverage in The Pioneer of the Simon Commission, that \nwas discussing the future form of India\u2019s constitution, yet did not have a single \n 22 \nIndian member on its board. All over India Simon was greeted by a sea of \nblack flags and mass civil disobedience. Gandhi led a massive demonstration \nand complete hartal \u2013 shut down of shops - in Bombay on the commission\u2019s \narrival in that city on 3rd February 1928 (Forbes, 1993:147). Educated women \nspoke, led and participated in a series of protests against the Dominion Status \nproposed by the commission, arguing that it was an arrangement to ensure \nthe continuation of British control. The Pioneer reports on these events total \n17 per cent of women\u2019s direct action category.   \n \nIn \u2018Another clash at Lucknow [Simon Commission and J Nehru injured]\u2019 the \npaper recorded 10,000 demonstrators who attended the procession. \u2018The \nboycotters on their part were busy making preparations from five in the \nmorning. Pandits Jawaharlal Nehru and Pant, accompanied by the local \nleaders and Mrs Mittra, led a huge flag procession of 10,000 men with big \nposters and placards bearing the slogan \u2018Simon Go Back' and 'Down with \nImperialism' ... and occupied a place nearest the Commission's route before \nseven o'clock.\u2019 ...[Police charged the crowd and beat them]...  \u2018University \nstudents who were in the procession kept Pandit Jawaharlal and Mrs Mittra \nsurrounded but Pandit Pant and other local leaders took their share of the \nbeating\u2019 (Pioneer 1928 December 2: 13,1).   \n \nTwo weeks later the paper reported that the Dowager Maharani of Mandi had \nled a deputation before the Simon Commission claiming a reservation of seats \nfor women in the legislatures. The paper also noted what was called \u2018The \nFeminine Touch\u2019: Lady Simon taking on board the appeals of women to have \n 23 \ntheir concerns heard by the Commission (Feb.10th, 1929).   Despite Lady \nSimon\u2019s categorical support for Indian women to take their part in (peaceful) \npublic life (March 13th, p.13) , Annie Besant was ready to do battle with her \nhusband in the pages of The Pioneer for interfering in the Viceroy\u2019s business, \nas reported in New India (29th Nov., p.7). She even followed up with the blunt \ncomment \u2018He (Simon) knows nothing about India and Indian feelings.\u2019 He \nrefuted this as \u2018fantastic nonsense\u2019 (Nov. 30 th p.9). The row made good copy.  \n  \nWomen and Strikes \nFrom 1928 to 1930 stories about textile strikes (where women formed a \nsignificant part of the workforce) were prominent \u2013 they account for 50 per \ncent of the 22 per cent \u2018direct action\u2019 category.   Whilst the paper deplored \ndirect action and violence against the British political and economic \ninfrastructure, it nevertheless reported accounts of women\u2019s attempts to \nimprove their own wages upwards from Rs33 per month (Pioneer, 9th \nDecember 1928: 20, 4) and subsequent arrests.  \n \n 'Bombay Strikes.  Determined to hold out. [At Kemp & Company] about 300 \nemployees, consisting of compounders, clerks, hamals, and women labourers \nsuddenly struck this morning\u2019 (Pioneer 1928, 21 April: 1).   \nThe strike escalated and the paper reported that 150,000 workers were on \nstrike (Pioneer 24th April 1928).  \u2018The Sweepers Strike in Calcutta\u2019 (June 28th, \n1928, p4) resulted in the arrest for alleged \u2018riotous conduct\u2019 of Miss Prabhati \nGas Gupta, President of the union; while some carters were removing refuse, \nthey were attacked by the strikers who pelted stones at them.  She was sent \n 24 \nbefore the magistrate but, as she was well educated and respectable, was \nbailed for Rs 300. \n \nEqually intimidation of strike-breakers was commented on: \u2018FEAR OF \nWOMEN PICKETS. [sic] Bombay. No attempt was made today to open the \nmills and the women pickets, who were posted at the mill gate to deal with the \nblacklegs, had an easy time. \/Clerks, oilmen, and other mechanics... hitherto \nabstained, fearing humiliating treatment at the hands of the pickets\u2019 (Pioneer \n1928 July 4:9).  \n \nForeign cloth boycott and burning  \n \nWomen also sought to disrupt mill production by making their own cloth. \nAlthough women were active in both nationalist and labour movements, that  \noccurred at the same time, the women involved  were not necessarily \npursuing the same goals : whereas trade union led strikes and picketing were \nfor wage increases and labour rights, Gandhi's Door-to-Door campaign \nencouraged women to participate in a foreign cloth boycott in every village \nand town, to \u2018collect foreign cloth and deliver or receive orders for khadi. \nForeign cloth should be burnt whenever possible\u2019 and they were told to \u2018picket \nshops selling such goods\u2019 [Ahmedabad] (Pioneer 1929 26 Jan: 15). It was \nimportant to undermine British cotton production and its infrastructure: \u2018The \nhelp of patriotic ladies should be enlisted to prosecute this boycott campaign\u2019 \n(ibid).  Gandhi also encouraged Muslim women to renounce foreign cloth to \n\u2018save Islam\u2019 (Forbes, op.cit., p.125). \n \n 25 \n \u2018Women's excesses at Jamshedpur . Chastisement with brooms.

(Pioneer 1928 16 July: 9, 3)  \n \n \nBefore Swaraj Day (10th March 1929) the paper covered an increasing \namount of stories involving the public destruction of foreign fabric in major \ncities. On   March 6th The Pioneer reported on its front page a huge foreign \ncloth bonfire held at Mirzapore Park in Calcutta the day before. It attracted a \n\u2018monster crowd\u2019 and Gandhi was arrested. Events on Swaraj Day itself were \ncovered extensively in The Pioneer. \u2018India Celebrates Swaraj Day (New Delhi \nMar 10). Huge Processions and Foreign Cloth Bonfires. Women in \nProcession. The Demonstrators held National flags and placards and sang \nnational songs along the route. A feature of the demonstration was the \npresence of about 60 women who formed a part of the procession\u2019 (Pioneer \n1929 Mar 13: 3, 1-3). When women participated in bonfires of cloth, they \nwould automatically be reported in black type pull quotes as if their presence \nwere so unusual a concept as to be highlighted for special attention. \n \nThe bonfires spread far and wide across many cities including Calcutta, \nPeshawar, Nagpur, Benares and Allahabad.  On 19th May 1929 Annie Besant \ncalled for a complete boycott of British produced cloth- an about turn that \nprovoked the wrath of editor FW Wilson: on 29th June he penned an editorial \nheaded \u2018Mrs Besant\u2019s Foolish Speech\u2019. It was a catch phrase that Wilson \n 26 \nhoped would stick, for he followed it with a further article on 8 July referring \nagain to: \u2019The Central Committee and its Dissentions. Mrs Besant\u2019s foolish \nspeech.\u2019 \n \nMeanwhile in 1930, the Secretary of the UP Chamber of Commerce had \nalready noted: \u2018The movement for boycott of foreign cloth, particularly British, \nis sweeping the country with an intensity and vigour that have never been \nknown before. Importers and dealers of foreign cloth in all principal markets of \nthe country are entering upon solemn undertakings to abandon trade in \nforeign cloth.\u2019 He added that this action \u2018is the outcome of their resentment \nagainst the economic and political policy of Government\u2019 (ed Mitra 1930; 423-\n424).  The minutes of the United Provinces Chamber of Commerce recorded  \nthat British textile business had ground to a halt as a result of boycott (Ed. \nMitra,1930:423).  \n \nReports of women\u2019s speech, protest and actions were set alongside \ncontextual coverage of considerable trade difficulties especially cotton mills, \nfacing stiff competition from China, US and Japan by February 1929. The \ncumulative effect of sustained strikes exacted its toll. Five years later \nCurrimbhoy Ebrahim & Sons Mill, the second largest Anglo-Indian mill in \nBombay and one of The Pioneer\u2019s most regular advertisers, was wound up. \nIts demise was reported on 18 January 1934 (page 4 col 3). \n \n \nEditorial dilemmas  \n 27 \nBy reiterating accounts of riots, the paper had to be careful not to be seen to  \ncondone  such behaviour. This editorial ambivolence was recognised by \nWilson when he castigated other papers as hypocritical : \u2018Indian newspapers \nwhich violently proclaim the boycott of foreign goods and declare that the \npurchase of such goods is a heinous sin and will delay the progress of the \nnation to the haven of Swaraj [self-government], do not hesitate to sell their \nadvertising space to dealers in foreign goods\u2019 (1928 The Pioneer April 28:12).  \nHow could The Pioneer\u2019s editor reconcile news values and liberalism with the \nobviously disastrous impact of strikes on the imperial economy? Anglo-Indian \noperations such as Elgin Mills, Currimbhoy and Cawnpore Cotton Mills had \nsuffered during the Bombay Mill strikes in 1928 and their share prices were \nbadly affected.   \n \nThe effect of the strikes and cloth burnings on trade was also demonstrated \nby a correlation between the dates of highest protest activity and lowest \nproduction. Britain\u2019s import trade dropped from 63% to 48% of total in 1927, \nas reported in the Pioneer 27th Jan 1928 (12, 1-2), and this was directly linked \nto mill strikes and foreign cloth burnings.  Concurrently, the Indian cotton \nspinning statistics charted the disastrous crash in national textile production \nrates for spun cloth in 1927 from nearly 70 million pounds (weight) to 61m \n(India Office Records 1928-1931). Regionally, Bombay mills suffered the \nworst fall from 43m in July 1927, plummeting to 14m in July 1928. United \nProvince\u2019s production rates also fell from 6m to 4.6m in March 1928, with a \nfurther small decrease in March 1929. Three peaks of activity in July and \nOctober 1928 and March 1929, of foreign cloth burnings and Swaraj Day \n 28 \nprotests coincided with the sharp fall in production rates.  The Pioneer  \nsplashed on their front page: 'European's Suicide. Worry Over Mill Strike in \nBombay.  Worried into a fit of temporary insanity on account of the frequent \nlabour troubles in Bombay, James Samuel Smith, a European, aged 53, \nSuperintendent of the Weaving Department of the Currimbhoy Mills, \ncommitted suicide by cutting his throat with a knife' (The Pioneer, 1928, 22 \nNov:1).  \n \nA fierce campaign of public foreign cloth burning on Swaraj Day (The Pioneer \n10th and 20th March 1929, pages 1 and 3) was followed in that same year by a \nsharp increase of advertising in The Pioneer by the cotton mill companies. \nProtests were also reported in Calcutta, Peshawar, Nagpur, Benares and New \nDelhi. Mill shares dropped sharply: Elgin Mills\u2019 share price fell from Rs10 to \nRs3 in a week (Pioneer 1929, 4 May: 21). Extensive strike action severely \naffected production at the cotton mills. Jawaharlal Nehru urged the purchase \nof khadi only and not Swadeshi Mill cloth, produced by an Anglo-Indian owned \nmill. The Swadeshi mill owners in Allahabad had tried to make a product \nsimilar to khaddar but Nehru insisted on homemade khaddar to drive the \nowners out of business (Pioneer 1929, March 20:7).  By appropriating the \nname \u2018swadeshi\u2019 [self-dependent] the mill owners hoped to present \nthemselves as supporters of the Indian workforce, although this cloth was \nbeing made for export. \n \nMeanwhile as Gandhi encouraged workers to be independent and to spin \ntheir own cloth on charkas, the impact of textile strikes was felt in the UK, and \n 29 \nBritish trade was affected. The paper rallied to boost interest in British goods. \n\u2018Foreign Cloth Boycott.   \u2018The steady reduction in Great Britain's  share in the \nimport trade of India is causing serious concern and suggests that the British \nshould make an especial study of bazaar demands with a view to the mass \nproduction of goods of low grades and should extensively seek to advertise\u2019 \n(The Pioneer 1928,  6th January :4).v The mill owners were slow to respond to \nthis advice and placed a series of adverts in the paper only when they were in \nreal trouble; these appeared regularly from March 1929 and on through to \nJanuary 1934 and beyond, with 2 or 3 appearing in each day\u2019s edition.  Most \nmills recovered by March 1932 due in part to the import of new machinery, \nenabling production to increase exponentially (Tomlinson, 1993:114; India \nOffice V\/14\/284). Although the figures for March 1932 demonstrated a healthy \nrecovery of 86m pounds of spun cloth, of which Bombay produced 49m and \nUnited Provinces 7m, the pressures were still immense.  \n  \n \nSome mills did not survive \u2013 one of the largest, Currimbhoy Mills, the object of \nmany strikes, went into receivership, as The Pioneer  reported on January \n18th 1934.  As a newspaper business The Pioneer also experienced this \neconomic flux. When Young took over as editor in 1933, he moved the paper \nto Lucknow, claiming that circulation was down to c. 5000 and that the \nAllahabad premises were decaying and decrepit, with snakes inside. Even \nKipling\u2019s desk has been allowed to rot, but the librarian had made replicas to \nsell, and had stolen valuable books and papers. Re-financing started \nimmediately after the princes had taken a lead (for the last time during British \n 30 \nrule) at the Round Table constitutional negotiations, by accepting a federation \nto reduce their dependence upon London. Young sought funding from \nbusiness interests based in Cawnpore, and significantly, also from the princes \nas the main regional landowning interest. This coincided with the no-rent \ncampaign that had been launched first in United Provinces. Significantly, there \nwas no rent strike coverage in January 1934 editions of the paper, nor indeed \nany reporting of direct action.  \n \nConclusion \nEvents and activities provided news and this in turn enabled newspaper \ncoverage that challenged existing assumptions about gender. The Pioneer \nshowed a real sense of women\u2019s sorrows, aims, resolutions and triumphs.  \nAlthough only receiving a small proportion of The Pioneer \u2018s political \ncoverage, female conviction shines through their actions, intelligent use of the \nnewspaper medium,  and in their language. Arguably even a short news \nreport telling readers about an event where women were active, but without \ndirect speech, nevertheless still gave those women a foothold (however \ntenuous) in the public sphere, by drawing their activities to the attention of \nreaders and increasing their profile.   \n \nThe Pioneer\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s boycotts exposed a weakness in the \npaper\u2019s imperialistic armour. Traditional Western journalistic values of \nobjectivity and a preference for \u2018bad news\u2019 dictated that direct action be \ncovered, but the ethical dilemma for The Pioneer was where to draw a line \nbetween support for the women\u2019s democratic cause, and women\u2019s unseemly \n 31 \nbehaviour in riots, boycotts, cloth-burning and strikes. Nehru\u2019s statement \nquoted earlier about women\u2019s organisational ability refers to 1930 when \nnationalist men were in prison but there is considerable evidence of female-\nled campaigning in advance of that date.  \n \nWomen attracted journalistic attention to their social and political cause, some \ndirectly and others indirectly \u2013 for this was a period when the notion of female \ncitizenship was in the process of being re-defined. Educated \u2018new women\u2019 \nwere able to take advantage of The Pioneer\u2019s short-lived liberalism at a time \nwhen almost anything female provided newspaper content \u2013 including book \nreviews, such as \u2018Mr West\u2019s \u2018The Life of Annie Besant\u2019 ( 5th May, 1929, p.10).  \n \nThe ongoing struggle by counter-hegemonic voices to achieve a public \nwindow in establishment communications challenged existing colonial \nassumptions about indigenous women, whilst simultaneously weakening the \neconomic resolve of British business and administrative authority. In-depth \nstudy of the press can problematise otherwise clear-cut post colonial \nphilosophies. It is clear that newspapers needed to obey the triple \nresponsibility of embracing news values, reflecting ideological change and \nconveying political pressure, and that as enterprises they are often not run \nprimarily to maximise profits. Although newspaper fortunes do not always \nfollow mainstream business cycles, in the process of conducting their \neveryday work, colonial organs such as The Pioneer became part of the \neconomic and ideological maelstrom that they were reporting on. In depth \nstudy of this process can tell scholars a lot about how easy, or difficult it was \n 32 \nto get ideas and information disseminated. In this case the nationalist \nmovement\u2019s limited counter hegemonic window also demonstrated the \nCongress Party \u2013 and their women\u2019s - organisational capabilities as a ruling \nparty.  \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nAdorno, Theodor (1997) Aesthetic Theory, University of Minneapolis, trans \nGretel Adorno and Rolf Tiedemann from (1970) \u2018Aesthetische Theorie\u2019 \nGesammelte Werke Vol 7, Frankfurt: Surhkamp.   \nAhuja, B.N.
