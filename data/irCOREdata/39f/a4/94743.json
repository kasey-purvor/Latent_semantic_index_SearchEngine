The British Crime Survey (BCS) has asked \nquestions exploring worry about crime of English and Welsh respondents since \n1982, and in the 2003\/2004 sweep of the BCS new questions were inserted into a \nsubsection to explore the frequency and intensity of such fearful events. As well \nas illustrating the rationale of the new measurement strategy, this research note \nreports the results of the new questions in direct relation to the \u2018old\u2019 methods. \nThe findings show that few people experience specific events of worry on a \nfrequent basis, and that \u2018old\u2019 style questions magnify the everyday experience of \nfear. We propose that \u2018worry about crime\u2019 is often best seen as a diffuse anxiety \nabout risk, rather than any pattern of everyday concerns over personal safety.  \n \n \nKey words \n \nFear of crime, methodology, survey design, emotions. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe would like to acknowledge the support of the ESRC (as award RES000231108) and the \nHome Office (UK) for making the data available to us. We are indebted to the Editor of the \nEuropean Journal of Criminology for his comments and to the anonymous reviewers for their \ninsights. Versions of this article have been presented at the European Society of Criminology \n2006 conference and at a GERN-sponsored seminar in Keele in March 2007. We thank those \nattending these and other conferences for their thoughtful comments on our work. Errors and \nomissions remain our own. \n \n \nWord count: 5943 (including references); with footnotes, 6, 107.  \n 2\nSocial surveys in Europe, North America and elsewhere regularly find widespread fear of \ncrime (Hough and Mayhew, 1983; Beukenhorst et al., 1993; Skogan, 1990; van Kesteren et al., \n2000; Results of Eurobarometer 58.0; Vanderveen, 2006; Widdop, 2007)  Studies such as the \nEuropean Social Survey, the British Crime Survey, and the International Crime Victim Survey \nall substantiate the view that across Europe fear of crime is (a) common, and (b) a problem in \nits own right, separate to crime itself (Hale, 1996; van Kesteren et al., 2000). Not only has fear \nof crime and disorder emerged as an exigent experience amongst the population of European \ncountries; some researchers have suggested people tend to experience \u2018fear\u2019 beyond the \nobjective risk of any likely victimisation  (Hale, 1996; Vanderveen, 2006).  \n \nYet despite the empirical, political and theoretical relevance of fear of crime, few \nstudies have examined the actual frequency and intensity of such \u2018feelings\u2019. Respondents are \ntypically asked only whether they are \u2018very\u2019, \u2018fairly\u2019, \u2018not very\u2019 or \u2018not at all\u2019 worried (or \nafraid) about becoming a crime victim. Large-scale cross-national European surveys like the \nInternational Crime Victim Survey and European Social Survey do not even ask directly about \ncrime when measuring \u2018fear\u2019, enquiring instead how safe respondents feel when walking alone \nin their area after dark. Respondents are thus not asked how often they worry, nor when they \nworry, nor what effects these worries have on their lives.  \n \nAs a consequence, instead of data on the patterning and ecology of events of fear, we \nare left with only vague \u2018global\u2019 summaries of intensity of worry or feelings of unsafety. \nCrucially, these vague summaries may diverge from the reality of everyday emotions that \naffect people\u2019s lives. In a general discussion of \u2018emotional self-report,\u2019 Robinson and Clore \n(2002a, 2002b) argue that research into emotion rarely accesses experiential knowledge (the \nspecific details surrounding an emotional arousal) since respondents are rarely feeling the \nparticular emotion at the time of the study (C\/f Farrall et al., 1997). Instead, research typically \nevokes generalised beliefs about emotion. These beliefs do not neatly map onto experience \nbecause different processes are involved that invoke different forms of knowledge and \nknowledge retrieval. Indeed, asking respondents about overall intensities of worry (\u2018How \nworried are you . . . ?\u2019) may complicate matters further. Warr (2000) suggests that standard \nsummaries represent future-orientated anxiety rather than any summary of past episodes or \ncurrent feelings of physical fear (see also Sacco, 2005). Jackson (2006) proposes that these \nquestions access individual\u2019s mental image of the risk of victimisation, and that having a \npersonalised, structured and emotionally tinged image of risk might be independent of whether \nthey ever actually find themselves in threatening situations. \n \nWe believe that a more detailed examination of everyday emotions about crime is long \noverdue if we are to formulate a more comprehensive picture of the distribution and \nsignificance of fear of crime. The pilot work (Farrall and Gadd, 2004) on which this research is \nbased employed a new set of measures which included: (a) the use of a filter question and (b) \nthe assessment of the frequency and intensity of fearful episodes. Data from these new \nquestions, fielded in an omnibus survey, suggested that while just over one-third of people in \nEngland and Wales (37%) had felt fearful about becoming a crime victim during the past year, \nactual episodes of fear were surprisingly infrequent. Indeed only 13% of the overall population \nhad actually felt fearful more than five times in that 12 month period. This finding calls into \nquestion current official calculations as to the extent of the fear of crime problem \u2013 at least if \none defines fear as the everyday experience of worry about crime (Farrall and Gadd, 2004). \n \nIn this latest study we explore the utility of these new, updated questions in direct \ncomparison with \u2018old\u2019 standard methods that have been employed in the British Crime Survey \n(BCS) since 1984. The 2003\/2004 sweep of the BCS included the new measures of fear within \n 3\none of the four follow-up modules administered to a subsection of respondents (approximately \n5,000 respondents). Participants also answered the old style fear of crime measures in the main \nquestionnaire. This article presents the initial raw data for both new and old style measures \nwith respect to three specific crimes: car crime, burglary and robbery. It also describes in more \ndetail than previous articles the full rationale of the new measurement strategy. We turn first to \nthe rationale. \n \nOld and new questions: Contrasting strategies of measurement \nOld questions \nLarge-scale representative sample surveys ask respondents questions along the following lines:  \n\u2018How worried are you about being [burgled\/mugged\/raped\/physically attacked by a \nstranger]?\u2019 \nRespondents select one answer from a set of response options. A standard example would \nbe: very worried, fairly worried, a bit worried, or not at all worried. At first glance, this \nresearch strategy seems unproblematic. Surveys ask for a brief summary of respondents\u2019 \nworries which respondents are presumably able to provide. Researchers then estimate the \ndistribution in a given population to produce an estimate of the everyday experience of worry \namong the general populace. One assumes such worry negatively affects individuals and \ndisrupts communities.  \n \nYet greater attention to detail may clarify the nature and impact of fear of crime in \npeople\u2019s everyday lives (Farrall et al., 1997). For example, how often do people worry, feel \nfearful or anxious? The answer could be less often than we think: \u2018old\u2019 standard measures may \nimply a greater prevalence of fear than specific measures of frequency commonly find (Farrall, \n2004, Farrall and Gadd 2004). Surveys rarely, if ever, ask how frequently people worry, only \nhow worried they are overall (although see Jackson, 2004 and 2005). Moreover, which \nthoughts, feelings and behaviour best characterise public responses? Anger may be more \nfrequent than fear (Ditton et al., 1999), uneasiness more common than corrosive fear. Yet \nsurvey measures only specify \u2018worry\u2019.  \n \nMore questions arise. How can we compare the answers of different people if \nrespondents interpret the meaning of \u2018worry\u2019 differently? Some may think of \u2018physical fear\u2019, \nothers of \u2018a passing moment of anxiety\u2019 (c\/f Hough, 1995). In addition, how do these emotions \nshape behaviour and well-being? Surveys rarely enquire into the impact of worry on people\u2019s \neveryday lives, so we simply do not know. And might some level of emotion be a naturally \noccurring response to crime rather than a pressing social problem in its own right? Why do we \nalways assume worry is negative (Fattah, 1993; Hale, 1996; Warr, 2000; Ditton and Innes, \n2005)?  \n \nGladstone and Parker (2003: 347) argue that: \u2018As a phenomenon, [worry] can range from \nan innocuous activity possibly associated with positive consequences (i.e. solution finding), \nthrough to a distressing and uncontrollable process like the excessive and chronic worry \nrecognised as the cardinal feature of generalised anxiety disorder. It has been defined broadly \nas repetitive thought activity, which is usually negative and frequently related to feared future \noutcomes or events.\u2019 Intriguingly for fear of crime research, this definition suggests that what \nmight be called dysfunctional or damaging worry is characterised by the frequency of these \nexperiences. As such, asking people about the regularity of crime fears is both \nmethodologically and empirically meaningful.   \n \nGladstone and Parker go on to suggest that worry has a number of distinctive factors. \nFirst, it is predominantly comprised of cognitions (thoughts), often involving a series of future-\n 4\norientated reflections, involving the embellishment of hypothetical outcomes. Second, it has a \n\u2018dynamic (and malleable) and narrative process in which themes are developed and elaborated \nrather than simply occurring as a string of negative thoughts\u2019 (ibid.: 347). Finally, worry \ninvolves awareness of or attention to possible danger, \u2018which is rehearsed without successful \nresolution . . . [and] usually [self-] described as difficult to dismiss\u2019 (ibid.: 347). Tallis et al. \n(1994) investigated the everyday experience of normal (i.e. non-pathological) worry. They \nfound that most of the individuals interviewed viewed their worries to be routine, mostly \nacceptable, with a narrative course and real-life triggers, focusing on realistic, rather than \nremote problems, which were often beneficial by stimulating activity. Worry was often seen as \na problem-solving activity, but Matthews (1990) believes that it is more of a \u2018mimicry\u2019 of \nproblem-solving activity since worry involves the rehearsal of fearful scenarios and the \namplification of worse-case scenarios: people who worry also engage in more catastrophic \nthinking (Davey and Levy, 1998; Vasey and Borkovec, 1992). In Tallis et al.\u2019s (1994) study, \nnegative consequences were noted amongst \u2018high worries\u2019, including greater frequency, more \nmood disturbance, a difficulty to stop worrying, and more perceived impairment in everyday \nfunctioning. \n \nIn one of the first empirical investigation of measures, Farrall et al. (1997) asked 64 \nrespondents a series of survey questions relating to worry, perceived risk of crime, perceived \nsafety, victimisation experiences and worries about other non-crime issues. Approximately one \nmonth later, these respondents were asked the same questions again, this time in qualitative \ninterviews. \u2018Mismatches\u2019 or inconsistencies in the responses given by respondents on sweep \none and two were common. Specifically, \u2018mismatches\u2019 were defined as instances where an \nindividual gave different answers depending upon the nature of the interview being undertaken. \nOnly 15 out of 64 sets of interviews did not produce mismatches. A significant number (where \nanswers differed to a moderate to strong degree) were related to the nature of the methodology \n- e.g. 46 out of a total of 114 were mismatches were generated between \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 \nquestions. In the majority of these cases, survey measures exaggerated the day-to-day \nexperience of concern or worry. The authors concluded:  \n \n\u2018\u2026the results of fear of crime surveys appear to be a function of the way the topic is \nresearched, rather than the way it is. The traditional methods used are methods which \nseem consistently to over-emphasise the levels and extent of the fear of crime. It seems \nthat levels of fear of crime, and, to a lesser extent, of victimisation itself, have been \nhugely overestimated\u2019 (Farrall et al. 1997:676). \n \nTwo follow-up studies then investigated whether questions about frequency better \ncapture the everyday experience of worry. Farrall and colleagues (Farrall and Gadd, 2004 and \nGray et al., 2006) developed and tested a new set of measures with two novel aspects: (a) the \nuse of a filter question, followed by (b) an assessment of the frequency and intensity of events \nof emotion. Farrall and Gadd (2004) found that frequency questions yielded smaller estimates \nof the fear of crime than \u2018old\u2019 standard BCS questions. Jackson et al. (2006) found that the \ndiscrepancy in the levels of fear identified by the old and new measures suggested that some \npeople reported being worried (using standard measures) without actually having worried \nrecently (using new measures).  \n \nNew questions  \nThe experience of some emotions is akin to events or brief episodes which can be located in \nspace and time. In this we include many people\u2019s fears about crime. In order to assess the \nextent of everyday experience of the fear of crime, the new questions explicitly focus on \nepisodes of fear. Old questions ask about a more general model of experience (\u2018How worried \n 5\nare you . . .\u2019). It is unclear whether faced with the old questions respondents summarise the \nfrequency with which they worry; whether they assess the intensity of each event and calculate \nsome kind of average; whether the process involves assessing both intensity and frequency; or \nwhether such an overall intensity fuses the everyday experience with other facets of \u2018fear of \ncrime\u2019 (see Hough, 2004; Jackson, 2004; Farrall et al., 2006; Jackson, 2006).  \n \nInitially piloted as part of an earlier ESRC-funded project (RES 000220040), the question \nset, included in the 2003\/2004 BCS, attempts to describe the frequency and intensity of \npeople\u2019s worries. Specifically, the new questions contain a filter question, measure frequency \nand intensity of fearful episodes and employ a narrow time frame of 12 months to allow \nrespondents a specific reference period which we believe they will be able to recall more \naccurately. The measurement strategy outlined here focuses on events of worry; while it \nexplores the intensity of the last fearful event, it does not elicit an overall intensity summary of \nworry (Farrall and Gadd, 2004):  \n \nQ1: \u2018In the past year, have you ever felt worried about\u2026.\u2019 (car theft\/ burglary\/ robbery) \nQ2: [if YES at Q1] \u2018How frequently have you felt like this in the last year\u2019 [n times \nrecorded] \nQ3: [if YES at Q1] \u2018On the last occasion how fearful did you feel?\u2019 [not very worried, a \nlittle bit worried, quite worried, very worried or cannot remember].  \n \nQuestions one and two above focus on the frequency of crime worries, allowing an \nestimation of the regularity with which people fear of crime that is arguably more precise. \nSpecifically, individuals can be classified according to whether they worry and, if they do, how \noften. Of course, it is an empirical question as to whether this strategy produces different \nresults to standard measures. But as mentioned above, there is early evidence that might be the \ncase (Farrall et al., 1997; Farrall and Gadd, 2004; Jackson et al., 2006). \n \n After the two frequency questions comes one item on the intensity of the last event of \nworry, and this provides a different type of population estimate. Instead of sampling \nindividuals and the number of times each individual worries, this question samples events. \nConsider in any one day that a number of people have worried about crime: a number of events \nof worry occurred, and each event had a level of intensity (as well, of course, as a given \ncontext and a set of antecedents and consequents). The new questions, posed in the BCS, ask \nrespondents to think back to the last time they felt worried and to report how intense that \nepisode was.1  By employing inferential statistics to infer to the population of England and \nWales, we can thus produce at the aggregate an estimate of the intensity of all of the individual \nevents of fear that occurred during the past 12 months of individuals throughout England and \nWales.  \n \nResults \nThe analysis is organised by three different types of crime: being robbed; being burgled; and \nhaving one\u2019s car stolen. Top-line frequencies are first provided from the \u2018old\u2019 standard \n                                                 \n1 Because of the way memory works, and because of the likely impact of the availability heuristic, we expect \nrespondents to be biased towards the most vivid and easily accessed recent event (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973). \nThe \u2018most recent event\u2019 will thus be more likely to be the most intense episode that occurred relatively recently \nrather than previously the most recent (Clore and Robinson, 2002a, 2002b). This is because more emotional \nepisodes are easier to remember than less emotional episodes. As such we expect our estimates to err on the side \nof exaggeration of the intensity of events of worry. \n 6\nmeasures of worry: \u2018How worried are about being . . . [each type of crime]?\u2019, and then, second, \nfrom the new questions2.  \n \nWorry about robbery \nTable 1 shows results according to the old \u2018standard\u2019 measures of worry. In the \n2003\/2004 sweep, just over one-third of respondents reported being worried about being \nrobbed (combining 11 per cent \u2018very\u2019 and 24 per cent \u2018fairly\u2019). Just under one-half were \u2018not \nvery\u2019 worried (45 per cent), leaving one-fifth who were \u2018not at all\u2019 worried (20 per cent) about \nrobbery. \n \nTable 1: Standard measure of the fear of crime (Robbery) \u2013 \u2018How worried are you about being \nrobbed?\u2019  \nOverall intensity of worry % \nVery worried  11.0 \nFairly worried 24.2 \nNot very worried 44.9 \nNot at all  19.8 \nDon\u2019t know 0.1 \nTotal 100 \nSource: 2003\/2004 British Crime Survey, weighted data, entire sample used \n \nThe new questions, asked later in the interview, posed the question slightly differently. \nWhen asked: \u2018In the past 12 months, have you actually worried about being robbed?\u2019, only \n16% of respondents reported having worried (Table 2). Those who said that they had recently \nworried were then asked how often. Remarkably, just over one-third of those who had worried \nover the past year had only worried between one and three times during that period, with a \nfurther one-quarter worrying between four and eleven times. \n \n \nTable 2: New measures of the fear of crime (Robbery) \u2013 \u2018How frequently have you felt like \nthis in the last year?

Figure 1 summarises the results from the old measures. Overall, 35% of \nrespondents reported being worried (summing \u2018fairly\u2019 and \u2018very\u2019) about being mugged or \nrobbed, 47% reported being worried about being burgled, and 45% reported being worried \nabout having their car stolen.  \n \n 10\nFigure 1: Worry about crime \u2013 standard measures. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nNot at all\nworried\nNot very\nworried\nFairly worried Very worried\n%\nRobbery\nBurglary\nCar theft \n \n \nData from old measures thus suggest that fear of crime is fairly widespread across \nEngland and Wales. Intriguingly however, the picture is different when one draws upon data \nusing questions phrased slightly differently but fielded in the same survey to the same \nrespondents (albeit at different stages of the interview). Figure 2 shows that 85% of \nrespondents had not actually worried in the past year about being mugged. Indeed, 68% had \nnot actually worried about being burgled or having their car stolen. Moreover, of those who \nhad worried, the frequency of these events was surprisingly low \u2013 very few people had worried \nmore than once a week during the previous year (Figure 2). \n \nFigure 2: Worry about crime in the past 12 months using new frequency measures  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nNo times 1-3 times 4-11 times 12-52 times 53+ times\nRobbery\nBurglary\nCar theft \n \n \nAdditionally, the new questions sampled events of worry. By asking respondents who \nhad worried recently to think back to the last time and report how worried they felt, the BCS \nsamples events rather than individuals. We can therefore infer the intensity of individual events \nof worry across England and Wales. Figure 3 shows that the vast majority of such events \ninvolved the individual feeling \u2018a little bit\u2019 or \u2018quite\u2019 worried.  \n \n 11\nFigure 3: Worry about crime using new event-sampling measures \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nNot very worried A little bit\nworried\nQuite worried Very worried\nRobbery\nBurglary\nCar theft \n \n \nFinally, to provide a further useful comparison of the old and new questions, when we \nlook at the responses for \u2018all crimes\u2019 (robbery, burglary and car theft combined) we can see \nthat very different terrains of fear are invoked by the old and new measures. Table 10 shows \nhow many crimes, out of the three possible offences, respondents had worried about according \nto the old and new questions.  \n \n \nTable 10: Not worried about robbery, burglary or car theft \u2013 comparison of old and new \nmeasures of the fear of crime  \nNumber of crimes worried about Old \nstandard \nmeasure \n(n=4448) \nNew \nmeasure \n(n=4440) \nNot worried about any crimes  7.0 54.5 \nWorried about one crime 8.9 23.5 \nWorried about two or more \ncrimes** \n84.1 22.0 \nTotal 100 100 \nSource: 2003\/2004 British Crime Survey, weighted data, sub-sample follow-up D \n** The categories for worried about two and three crimes have been collapsed since the new questions excluded \nthose who did not have \u2018regular access to a car\u2019, while the old questions did not, although respondents had the \noption of replying \u2018not applicable\u2019.  \n \nNoticeably, the old measures picked up some level of worry (worry about one or more \ncrimes) almost throughout the sample (93%), while less than a half of the same sample (46%) \nreported some instance of worry via the new measures. Indeed, while the old questions suggest \nthe majority are worried about two or more crimes (85%), 78% of people answering the new \nquestions are either not worried or just experience worry about one crime in isolation. This \ncomparison eloquently demonstrates that the old standard questions not only seem to uncover \nmuch larger numbers of people who worry about crime, but tap into a more generalised or \nbroad expression of worry (Hough, 2004). The new questions meanwhile, which have been \ndesigned in accordance with current thinking on survey design (Farrall, 2004) suggests to us \nthat the extent to which people actually experience worrying events in their everyday lives is \nmuch lower by comparison.   \n 12\n \nConclusions \nWe began this article by highlighting how anxiety about crime is widely viewed as a lived \nexperience above and beyond the actual likelihood of victimisation. How has this perception \nfared in the light of our empirical findings? The findings from the study presented in this \narticle suggest that the extent of fear of crime \u2013 here defined more specifically as episodes of \nworry that manifest in people\u2019s everyday lives \u2013 may have been overstated by standard \nresearch tools. Old survey questions indicate that a significant minority of the English and \nWelsh population reported being worried about crime. Yet new questions show that the \nfrequency of worry is actually rather low.  \n \nThis suggests that questions about the frequency of worry measure something more \nspecific than questions about an overall intensity of worry; in many instances, standard \nindicators may be tapping into a more diffuse anxiety (Hough, 2004), a generalised awareness \nand \u2018image\u2019 of risk (Jackson, 2006), and a condensation of broader concerns about crime, \nstability, and social change (Taylor and Jamieson, 1996; Girling et al. 2000; Farrall, 2006). On \nthis matter we must remain cautious at least for a little while; we will explore this idea in much \nmore detail in future work.  Nevertheless this has important implications for the manner in \nwhich we measure fear of crime, not least because worry about crime has become an important \npolicy issue across Europe. In the UK, for example, it is an indicator of effectiveness for crime \nreduction partnerships and the police, and legitimises a wide range of anti-social behaviour \nstrategies and community safety agendas (Burney, 2005). Critically, policy makers and \npractitioners may be most interested in reducing the \u2018type\u2019 of fear that manifests in specific \nevents.  \n \nPeople experience anxiety about all sorts of things \u2013 their family, their employment, \ntheir health. One reason why fear of crime has become a significant social and political issue, \nand attracted so much social scientific research, is that it is widely seen as a significant social \nproblem. Such status may rest, in large part, on the assumption that fear of crime occurs \nregularly amongst the populace, with all the deleterious effects that this entails. Yet it seems, \nafter all, to be a relatively infrequent experience when research focuses on a more \nexperientially-based conception of fear.  Intriguingly, many people are happy to report an \noverall level of worry in crime surveys. As Garland (2001) argues, crime has become a part of \npublic consciousness. Yet we have shown that specific events of worry are relatively rare. Is it \ntime to start to reassess the conceptual and social-problem status of the fear of crime? \n \n 13\nReferences \n \nBeukenhorst, D. J., Huys, H. J. W. M., Oudhof, J. and Roduijn, J. (1993).
