Methods Systematic review of economic studies undertaken alongside robust study designs of clinical guideline implementation strategies published (1966-1998). Studies assessed against the BMJ economic evaluations guidelines for each stage of the guideline process (guideline development, implementation and treatment). Results 235 studies were identified, 63 reported some information on cost. Only 3 studies provided evidence that their guideline was effective and efficient. 38 reported the treatment costs only, 12 implementation and treatment costs, 11 implementation costs alone, and two guideline development, implementation and treatment costs. No study gave reasonably complete information on costs. Conclusions Very few satisfactory economic evaluations of guideline implementation strategies have been performed.

These concerns have led to increasing policy \ninterest in quality improvement activities across a wide range of health care systems and \nsettings.  Clinical practice guidelines are an increasingly common element of such quality \nimprovement activities throughout the world.  Guidelines have been defined as  \n\u201csystematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about \nappropriate health care\u201d.1  They have the potential to improve the care received by \npatients by promoting interventions of proven benefit and discouraging ineffective \ninterventions.  However, the development and introduction of guidelines is not itself \nwithout cost.  Even when they represent effective and cost-effective practice for the \nsetting in which they are to be introduced (which is not always the case, particularly in \nrelation to cost-effectiveness), their implementation may not be efficient.  In some \ncircumstances, the costs of guideline development and introduction are likely to outweigh \ntheir potential benefits.  In other circumstances, it may be more efficient to adopt less \ncostly but less effective implementation strategies.  Local health care organisations have \nrelatively few resources for clinical effectiveness activities and policy makers need to \nconsider how best to use these to maximise benefits based upon consideration of the \nlikely benefits and resources needed for different implementation strategies.  Whilst there \nare a substantial number of systematic reviews of the effectiveness of different guideline \nimplementation strategies, none have explicitly reported on the cost-effectiveness of \ndifferent strategies.2-8  \n \n4  \nEconomic evaluation is a way of providing information about whether the benefits of \nadopting a course of action compensate for the loss of benefits which would have been \ngenerated had the best alternative use been made of the limited resources.  It does this by \nundertaking a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their \ncosts (resource use) and benefits.9 Bringing costs and benefits together in an economic \nevaluation provides information as to whether:  \n\u2022 one strategy should be preferred to another as it provides more benefits and uses less \nresources (i.e. is \u2018cost-saving\u2019); or  \n\u2022 the extra benefits obtained by a more costly strategy are worth the extra resources (i.e. \nis \u2018cost-effective\u2019).   \n \nThis paper reports a systematic review of economic evaluations and cost analyses \nundertaken alongside rigorous but non-economic evaluations of guideline implementation \nstrategies.  We identify the methods used in such economic studies and their frequency, \nand summarise existing evidence on the efficiency of guideline implementation strategies.  \nWhere possible we have described the resource use involved in guideline development \nand implementation, as such data may help inform decision-makers as to the likely cost of \nthese activities. From this, we draw conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the \nexisting economic evaluations of guideline implementation and make recommendations \nabout how such studies can be improved. \n \nECONOMIC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK \nIn principle, economic evaluations of guideline implementation strategies should be based \non the same basic principles as an evaluation of a standard health technology (a new drug \nor a new type of surgery).9  A standard health technology assessment limits itself to the \n5  \nconsideration of the costs and benefits of providing a treatment (e.g. administering drug A \nor drug B) and the consequences of that treatment.  The evaluation of guideline \nimplementation strategies is different in that the breadth of costs and benefits that could \nbe considered is wider.  Determining whether the implementation of a guideline is \nworthwhile involves determining (a) whether the practice embodied in the guideline \nrepresents an efficient use of resources and (b) whether the guideline implementation \nprocess represents the most efficient way of bringing practice into line with that embodied \nin the guideline.  \n \nThere are three distinct stages in the introduction of guidelines that could be considered in \nan economic evaluation of guideline implementation:10\n1. Development of the guideline; \n2. Implementation of the guideline; and \n3. Treatment effects and costs as a consequence of behaviour change. \n \nThe first stage covers the costs and benefits of assembling the data and agreeing the \nguideline recommendations.  From the economic perspective the development should \nonly commence once consideration has been given to whether devoting resources to \nimprove health care delivery is the best way to improve people\u2019s health.  It should also \nconsider whether the recommendations would represent effective and efficient practice \nfor the health care provider and the client groups they serve.  The second stage involves \ndissemination of the guideline (e.g. through workshops) or the adoption of active \nimplementation strategies (e.g. the use of patient specific reminders).  Activities such as \nthe organisation of workshops or reminder systems would involve resource use and may \nalso benefit the professional and patient groups involved in the behaviour change process.  \n6  \nFrom an economic perspective the choice of implementation strategies to be evaluated \nshould also be influenced by the consideration of the setting in which they are to be \nintroduced and an understanding of the relative importance of the different factors \ninfluencing the health care professionals behaviour (i.e. knowledge of their utility \nfunction).  The final stage considers the costs and benefits consequent on the behaviour \nchange.  For instance, the change in cost, patient well-being and other benefits caused by \nchanges in treatment. \n \nAlthough the structure of an economic evaluation of guideline implementation strategies \ncould include the costs and benefits from each of the three stages, it may sometimes be \nlegitimate to design an economic evaluation of more limited scope.  For example, it \nwould be legitimate to evaluate only the costs and benefits of disseminating and \nimplementing a guideline that had already been shown to represent efficient practice in \nthe setting in which it is to be applied.11,12  A further reason for legitimately limiting the \nscope of the economic evaluation relates to its perspective.  If a non-societal perspective, \nfor example that of the health care provider, is adopted then it may be legitimate to \nexclude costs falling on the patient as well as those benefits gained by health \nprofessionals in terms of improved knowledge, job satisfaction that may arise during \ndevelopment and implementation of the guideline.  A final possible reason for not \nmeasuring some costs and benefits is when the assumption can be made that their \ninclusion will not change the policy decision.  For example, if it is believed, a priori, that \na guideline will substantially reduce the costs of treatment while maintaining or \nimproving the outcomes of patients it may be felt legitimate to exclude the costs of \ndevelopment, and implementation as they could not possibly cancel out any savings in \ntreatment costs.  However, this makes it difficult to judge which implementation strategy \n7  \nwas the most efficient.  Furthermore, this limits the transferability of results to situations \nwhere the same implementation strategies are compared for a guideline addressing the \nsame issues in a similar setting. Whether such limitations are appropriate depends on the \njustification given for the limitation.  Such justification should be explicit and supported \nby appropriate evidence.   \n \nThe extent that the economic evaluations and cost analyses included in this review have \nconsidered all costs and benefits from each of the three stages is assessed as part of the \nreview.  Where relevant costs and benefits have been excluded, consideration will be \ngiven to whether their exclusions were justified on the basis of stated perspective, \nunimportance to final conclusions, or previous work showing adoption of the guideline \nrecommendation would be efficient.  \n \nMETHODS \nThis review of economic evaluations and cost analyses in evaluations of clinical guideline \nimplementation strategies was undertaken as part of a broader review of the effectiveness \nof guideline implementation strategies.13\n \nSummary of methods for the review of effectiveness of guideline implementation \nstrategies \nStudies were selected for inclusion if they met the following criteria: study design \u2013 \nrandomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before and \nafter studies (CBA), or interrupted time series analysis (ITS); intervention \u2013 guideline \nimplementation strategies; participants \u2013 medically qualified health care providers; and \noutcomes \u2013 objective measures of provider behaviour and\/or patient outcome.  The \n8  \nfollowing databases were searched using an extensive search strategy that was 92% \nsensitive for studies meeting the inclusion criteria:13 MEDLINE (1966-1998); EMBASE \n(1980-1998); HealthSTAR (1975-1998); SIGLE (1980-1998); the Cochrane Controlled \nTrials Register (4th edition 1998) and the register of the Cochrane Effective Practice \nOrganisation of Care Group (EPOC).  Studies were not excluded on the basis of language \nand attempts were made to identify unpublished studies e.g. final reports and \ndissertations.  Approximately 150,000 hits were screened by two researchers.  Hard \ncopies of 863 potentially relevant studies were retrieved of which 235 met the inclusion \ncriteria.  Two reviewers independently undertook detailed data abstraction.   \n \nInclusion criteria for the review of economic evaluations and cost analyses \nFor the review of economic evaluations and cost analyses, two reviewers independently \nassessed whether studies reported any economic data.  Studies were included if they \nreported either an economic analysis or cost analysis.  A study was considered to have \nundertaken an economic evaluation if it reported evidence on costs and at least surrogate \nendpoints for effectiveness\/benefits.  A study was considered to have undertaken a cost \nanalysis if it failed to relate costs to effectiveness\/benefits.   \n \nReview of methodological quality of economic evaluations and cost analyses \nIncluded studies were assessed against the British Medical Journal guidelines for \nreviewers of economic evaluations.14  These guidelines are designed to improve the \nquality of economic evaluations and cover three broad areas including study design, data \ncollection, and analysis and interpretation of results.  The criteria were not used as a \nscoring system but rather as a common means of summarising those aspects of an \neconomic evaluation that are generally considered to be important.  Even though these \n9  \nguidelines were published in 1996 it is worth noting they represent refinements to criteria \nthat had been developed over 20 year earlier.  If studies only reported cost analyses, they \nwere not assessed against the criteria relating to benefits.   \n \nReview of results of economic evaluations and cost analyses \nData were abstracted on resource use and cost of guideline development and \nimplementation and any resulting changes in clinical treatment and summarised according \nto the type of implementation strategies adopted. \n \nRESULTS \nStudies reporting cost analyses or economic evaluations \nSixty three of 235 (27%) studies (involving 78 comparisons) reported economic \nevaluations and cost analyses (see appendix).  Characteristics of the included studies are \ndescribed in Table 1.  The majority of the studies were conducted in the USA and aimed \nto improve management.  Thirty-six studies tried to change 1 behaviour, the remainder \ntargeted several behaviours (to a maximum of 6).15   \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nInterventions evaluated \nComparisons were made between more than 2 strategies in several studies (Table 2) and a \ntotal of 53 different behaviour change strategies were considered (including \u2018no \nintervention\u2019 controls).  Forty behaviour change strategies were multifaceted, involving \nmore than 1 intervention.  The maximum number of interventions employed was 7.16  \n10  \nOther than the \u2018no intervention\u2019 control only 1 strategy (use of reminders alone) was used \nin more than 10 studies.   \n \nTable 2 about here \n \nMethodological quality of economic evaluations \nThe methodological quality of the included studies is summarised in Table 3.  Of the 10 \nstudies that stated the viewpoint of the study 4 took the perspective of the health service, \n17-20 5 that of the hospital or providers,21-25 and only 1 a societal perspective.26 Almost all \nthe studies provided some simple rationale for the choice of implementation strategies \nconsidered.  However, none of the studies reported studying the utility functions of the \nhealth care professionals in order to determine the design of the implementation strategies \nthat were to be evaluated. \n \nThe form of economic evaluation was rarely stated.  Even where it was stated it was \nsometimes misleading.  For example, 3 studies reported that they had undertaken \u2018cost-\nbenefit\u2019 analyses.26-28  Two of these presented differences in cost set against differences in \nseveral measures of effectiveness, without any attempt at aggregation (a design defined in \nthis paper as a cost-consequence analysis).26,28 The third undertook a cost analysis.27  \nThirty five of the remaining studies were cost consequence analyses, 11 were cost-\neffectiveness analyses and 13 reported some aspect of cost (e.g. staff or material costs) \nbut made no effort to relate costs to benefits (cost analyses). \n \nTable 3 about here \n \n11  \nData collection criteria \nSources of effectiveness estimates \nAll the studies used experimental or quasi-experimental study designs.  However, \nmethodological weaknesses often undermined the effectiveness results.  For example, the \nstatistical significance of benefits was uncertain in 16 RCTs, CCTs and CBAs that had \npotential unit of analysis errors and 11 ITS studies were inappropriately analysed in the \npublished reports. \n \nOnly 5 studies attempted to measure health outcomes.18, 26,29-31  Only 1, using a balance \nsheet approach, attempted to consider any wider benefit either to patients, their families or \npractitioners.26  The reliance on process measures by the majority of studies was of \nuncertain validity as few provided any details of how the evidence base supporting \nrecommendations was constructed.  Therefore, it is unclear whether any of the observed \nchanges in behaviour improved or maintained patient outcomes or were efficient. \n \nMethods for estimation of costs \nThirty eight studies only considered the costs consequent on behaviour change (treatment \ncosts).  Eleven reported costs of implementation and 12 implementation and treatment.  \nOnly 2 considered the costs of guideline development, implementation and treatment.26,32  \nThese 2 studies were amongst the few that attempted to provide descriptions of resource \nuse but neither were comprehensive in terms of costs considered.  One did attempt to \nbring uncosted resource use into the decision making process by using a balance sheet \napproach.26  Overall, no study gave reasonably complete information on the estimation of \ncost for guideline development, implementation and treatment. \n \n12  \nAnalysis criteria  \nDiscounting was not undertaken or mentioned in any of the economic evaluations in \nwhich it was required and few reported any form of sensitivity analysis.  The sensitivity \nanalysis that was conducted was very limited.  For example, in 12 studies sensitivity \nanalysis was limited to changes in a single variable (e.g. a cost of a procedure).   \n \nIn 1 study, initially planned as a cost-effectiveness analysis, the implementation strategy \nwas cost saving.25  In all but 11 of the 38 cost-consequences analyses it was concluded \nthat the implementation strategy was \u2018efficient\u2019. In 3 studies the implementation strategy \nwas reported to be more costly but no more effective.28,31,33  These conclusions must \nclearly be treated with suspicion, as must the other conclusions about cost and efficiency, \ngiven the limitations in methodology, especially the lack of reports on the evidence base \nfor the guideline and reporting of the methods used described above.   \n \nSummary of resource and cost estimates for guideline development, and \nimplementation \nDue to the generally poor quality of reporting of the economic evaluations, data on \nresource use and cost of guideline development and implementation were available for \nonly 4 analyses.26,32-34  In one of these studies conducted in the 1970\u2019s and which \ncompared audit and feedback with a local consensus process, the estimates of resource \nuse may no longer be generalisable.33  Two studies used the preparation and \ndissemination of educational materials along with educational meetings26,32 and one \nprovision of reminders.34  A summary of the resource use information reported in these \nstudies is available from the authors.   \n \n13  \nDISCUSSION  \nBy systematically identifying and critiquing the available economic evidence on guideline \nimplementation strategies, we have sought to provide information to decision-makers and \nresearchers to aid in their deliberation on how best to get guidelines into practice.  A total \nof 63 studies were identified that reported an economic evaluation or cost analysis. The \nmultifaceted nature of many of the implementation strategies adopted, the multitude of \npolicy issues addressed and the weak methodology adopted by the majority of the studies \nprecluded the presentation of results on the efficiency of alternative implementation \nstrategies in any meaningful form.   \n \nOverall, the methodological quality of the 63 included studies was poor.  This finding is \nsimilar to other reviews of economic evaluations36 and in part should be expected given \nthe loose interpretation of what defines an economic evaluation.  In another recently \ncompleted review of economic evaluations, studies had to present costing methodology in \nthe methods section and results of the economic evaluation in the results section in order \nto be included in the review.37  Had this criteria been applied in this review it would \nundoubtedly have reduced the number of included studies, but it is unlikely that the \noverall conclusion of generally poor methodology would have changed. \n \nOne of the main weaknesses of the included studies is the very limited attempts to show \nthat the guidelines that were to be implemented would represent effective or efficient \npractice.  This combined with the use of process measures by many of the studies severely \nlimits the validity of any conclusions drawn that development and implementation of the \nguideline represents an efficient use of resources.   \n \n14  \nThe majority of identified studies considered only the costs of treatment and its \nconsequences.  In several cases this limitation in scope would not be expected to change \nthe conclusions, as the magnitude of cost savings provided by adopting the recommended \npractice was so large.38-42  Therefore in such cases, other methodological weaknesses \naside, the evaluation would have been fit for the purpose for which it was designed.  \nHowever, the results of such evaluations are context specific and have limited \ntransferability as it is not possible to determine whether the resources used to provide the \nimplementation strategies compared within these studies were efficiently used.  \nFurthermore, none of the studies reported using any economic rationale to determine the \ndesign of the implementation strategies.  This leads to further uncertainty about whether \nstrategies that had the potential to change behaviour in the desired way were compared.  \n \nThe results presented in this paper are based on a search strategy that was developed to be \nas comprehensive as possible and over 150,000 abstracts were assessed.  Studies were \nonly identified to the end of 1998 and it is possible that more recent studies are of higher \nquality, as guidelines such as those published by the BMJ have become more readily \navailable.  Nevertheless, the majority of included studies were published in the 1990s and \nsimilar guidance had been published years earlier.refs  Williams, Drummond   On the \nwhole the studies included in this paper are of a generally low methodological quality \nregardless of when or where the study was conducted and published.   \n \nThe search strategy was also devised with the intention of identifying those studies based \non robust study designs.  The study designs chosen were those that, if analysed \nappropriately, could provide the most robust data on effectiveness.  As such data often \nhelp determine total costs and are integral to estimates of efficiency it is implicit that such \n15  \nstudies should provide the best data on which to base, at least, some parts of an economic \nevaluation.  It is possible that the search strategy may not have identified some studies \nthat have reported economic data separately or have used data from robust study designs \nto model efficiency.  However, given the limitations in the primary evidence base the \ninclusion of any such studies would not change the findings of this study. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nRecently a number of agencies, such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in \nthe UK and the Task Force for Preventive Services in the USA, have explicitly started to \nproduce guidelines incorporating evidence on effectiveness and efficiency.45,46  There are \nhowever still concerns that such national guidance may not represent efficient practice at \na local level.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the simple production of such evidence \nbased guidelines does not appear to change practice,47 which again highlights the need for \nthe evaluation of guideline implementation strategies.  However, the paucity of data on \nresource use, cost and efficiency of guideline implementation strategies has been shown \nin this review.  Overall, studies were of poor methodological quality and did not appear to \nconsider guidelines based on evidence of effectiveness or efficiency.  Studies also did not \nreport an economic rationale for the choice of implementation strategies considered and \ndid not cover all stages of guideline implementation that may be relevant.   \n \nIt is tempting to recommend further large scale studies that can give unbiased estimates of \ncosts and effect for all three stage (guideline development, implementation and the \ntreatment effects and costs as a consequence of behaviour change).  However, it is \nunlikely that in many cases such studies will be practical due to statistical issues relating \nto sample size requirements.  The approach outlined by Mason et al (1999) and Sculpher \n16  \n(2000) seems more realistic.11,48 They argue that primary studies should concentrate on \nevaluating behaviour change and estimating costs of development and implementation of \nthe guideline, while modelling exercises should use these data to determine whether the \nguideline is efficient within the setting considered and at the level of behaviour achieved \nor desired.11,48 \n17  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work reported in this paper was part of a larger study funded by the UK NHS \nResearch and Development, Health Technology Assessment Programme and would have \nnot have possible without the work of Cynthia Fraser, Craig Ramsay, Paula Whitty, \nMartin Eccles, Lloyd Matowe, Liz Shirran, Michel Wensing, Rob Dikstra, Cam \nDonaldson and Allen Hutchison.
