In order to examine the role of the BamHI W region in B cell infection and growth transformation, we constructed a series of recombinant EBVs carrying different numbers of BamHI W repeats and carried out B cell infection experiments. We concluded that EBV requires at least 2 copies of BamHI W repeats to be able to activate transcription and transformation in resting B cells in vitro. At least 5 copies of BamHI W were required for optimal transcription and transformation; while increasing the number beyond 5 copies had no further effect. Experiments to try to rescue the impaired virus indicated that the expression of sufficient levels of EBNA-LP and EBNA2 from Wp are the key determinants of virus-driven B cell transformation. We believe that EBV has evolved to contain multiple copies of BamHI W repeats to ensure high levels of Wp-initiated transcripts immediately post infection.<\/dc:description><dc:contributor.advisor>\n        Rickinson, Alan<\/dc:contributor.advisor><dc:contributor.advisor>\n        Tierney, Rose<\/dc:contributor.advisor><dc:date>\n        2011-07<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Thesis<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        NonPeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/etheses.bham.ac.uk\/1493\/2\/Kao_11_PhD.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        public<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/etheses.bham.ac.uk\/1493\/2.hassmallThumbnailVersion\/Kao_11_PhD.pdf<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Kao, Kuan-Yu (2011) Control of the EBV growth transformation programme: the importance of the Bamhi W repeats.
