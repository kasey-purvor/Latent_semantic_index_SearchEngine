Interest in\nsuch phenomena, usually referred to as wave turbulence\n(WT), arises both from their great importance in terms of\nbasic nonlinear physics and from numerous applications\nin engineering and the life sciences. One of the best\nknown applications is in weather prediction, using infor-\nmation received from the measurements of the spectrum\nof waves on the sea surface. Turbulence in a system of\ncapillary waves is of interest because its dynamics on this\nwavelength scale plays a significant role in the transfer\nand dissipation of energy on the liquid surface. Studies of\nnonstationary phenomena in systems of capillary waves\nare of particular importance because they could provide\ndirect information about nonlinear wave interactions. In\nspite of the large number of experimental studies devoted\nto the nonlinear dynamics of surface waves, however,\nthere are only a few recent reports [2\u20135] of experimental\nstudies of capillary turbulence that are directly compa-\nrable with theoretical predictions.\nRecently, the use of liquid hydrogen as a model me-\ndium has brought significant progress in the understand-\ning of capillary turbulence. The remarkable properties of\nliquid hydrogen (its low viscosity and the high nonline-\narity of its capillary waves, and the possibility of driving\nthe electrically charged surface of the liquid directly)\nhave allowed us to observe the following for the first\ntime: the formation of the Kolmogorov power-law turbu-\nlent spectrum over a wide range of frequencies\n(102\u2013104 Hz) [4], the modification of the scaling index\nof the turbulent spectrum in dependence on the spectral\ncharacteristics of the driving force [10], and the cutoff of\nthe power spectrum of capillary turbulence at high fre-\nquencies due to the change of the energy transfer mecha-\nnism from nonlinear waves transformation to viscous\ndamping [11]. Many important properties of waves on\nthe surface of liquid hydrogen are similar to those of0031-9007=04=93(7)=074501(4)$22.50 \uf6d9conventional liquids like water (cf. the capillary lengths\nfor liquid hydrogen \u0001 \u0001 0:19 cm at T \u0001 15 K, and for\nwater \u0001 \u0001 0:28 cm at T \u0001 293 K), providing an addi-\ntional argument for using liquid hydrogen as a perfect\ntest fluid for accurate tests of WT theory. The latter are of\nconsiderable importance, because WT theory is used to\ndescribe turbulent processes in a wide variety of media,\nincluding, e.g., plasmas [12], astrophysics [13], ocean\nsurfaces [14], acoustic turbulence in superfluid He II\n[15], and nonlinear optics [16].\nIn this Letter we report the first observations of decay\nof the turbulent state in a system of capillary waves on\nthe surface of liquid hydrogen. We have observed that\nthe decay of the stationary turbulent spectrum starts in\nthe high frequency domain, with the energy remaining\nlocalized in the low frequency range of the turbulent\nspectrum, i.e., near the driving frequency. At low fre-\nquencies the turbulent spectrum remains close to its\nunperturbed shape for a relatively long period of time\nafter the driving force is switched off. This observation\ndiffers significantly from what might be expected from\nthe self-similar theory of nonstationary WT processes [1],\nwhere the evolution of the spectrum is considered in the\nrange of frequencies where viscous damping can be\nneglected.\nWe show that where there is finite damping at all\nfrequencies, viscous losses cause qualitative changes in\nthe evolution of the turbulent spectrum after removal of\nthe driving force: rather than a propagation of perturba-\ntions from low to high frequencies, caused by the cascade\ntransfer of energy (the scenario considered in [1]), there is\na relatively fast decay of the high frequency domain of\nthe spectrum. Although our observations are new, and\ncame as a surprise, we show that they can still be under-\nstood qualitatively within the framework of the general\nWT theory [1].\nExperimental observations.\u2014The experimental ar-\nrangements were similar to those used in our earlier2004 The American Physical Society 074501-1\nFIG. 1.

The measurements were made\nusing an optical cell inside a helium cryostat. Hydrogen\nwas condensed into a cup formed by a bottom capacitor\nplate and a guard ring 60 mm in diameter and 6 mm high.\nThe layer of liquid was 6 mm thick. The top capacitor\nplate (a collector 60 mm in diameter) was located at a\ndistance of 4 mm above the surface of the liquid. A two-\ndimensional positive charge layer was created just below\nthe surface of the liquid with the aid of a radioactive plate\nplaced at the bottom of the cup. The temperature of the\nliquid was 15\u201316 K. The waves on the charged surface\nwere excited by a periodic driving voltage applied be-\ntween the guard ring and the upper electrode. They were\ndetected from the variation of the total power P\u0002t\u0003 of a\nlaser beam reflected from the oscillating surface, which\nwas measured with a photodetector, sampled with an\nanalog-to-digital converter, and stored in a computer.\nGiven the size of the light spot, the correlation function\nI! \u0001 hj\t!j2i of the surface elevation \t\u0002r; t\u0003 in frequency\nrepresentation is directly proportional to the squared\nmodulus of the Fourier transform of the detected signal,\nI! \u0001 const\u0007 P2! at frequencies above 50 Hz.\nIn systems of finite size, the power spectrum of capil-\nlary turbulence is discrete; but, at frequencies much\nhigher than the lowest resonant frequency (which in our\nexperiments was \b3 Hz), the intrinsic spectrum of reso-\nnant frequencies becomes quasicontinuous due to viscous\nbroadening of the resonances and\/or nonlinear broaden-\ning at pumping rates exceeding a critical value (see\ntheory [8,18] and observations [2\u20135]). To establish the\nsteady turbulent state at the surface of the liquid, a 95 Hz\nac driving voltage was applied for \b10 s. It was then\nswitched off, and we observed the relaxation oscillations\nof the surface. The instantaneous power spectrum P2! of\nnonstationary surface oscillations was calculated by us-\ning a short-time Fourier transform of the measured signal\nP\u0002t\u0003 [19].\nIt is clearly evident from Fig. 1 that, during decay of the\nturbulence, it is the high frequency components of the\npower spectrum that are damped first. The amplitude of\nthe main peak at the driving frequency remains larger\nthan the amplitudes of peaks at the harmonics, all the\ntime, both before and after the driving force is switching\noff, i.e., the surface of the liquid continues to oscillate\nmainly at the driving frequency. The wave amplitude in\nthe turbulent distribution decreases homogeneously dur-\ning the decay, and the power-law dependence of the\nspectrum persists, even for low frequencies down to\n100 Hz.\nNumerical calculations.\u2014To try to understand the pe-\nculiar form of decay, we modeled numerically the time\nevolution of the initial steady-state turbulent power spec-\ntrum of the capillary waves. According to WT theory\n[1,6] the evolution of a turbulent spectrum can be de-\nscribed by the integro-differential kinetic equation (KE)074501-2for the classical occupation numbers nk of surface waves,\nwhere k is a wave vector. In our calculations we used the\nso-called \u2018\u2018local approximation\u2019\u2019 for the KE, where the\ncollision integral was approximated by a differential\noperator. This approach is similar to the well-known\nFokker-Plank equation approach in the kinetic theory of\ngases [20] and is based on nonlinear interactions between\nwaves of comparable frequencies.

A similar phenomenological model of WT has been\nused successfully before, e.g., in studies of gravitational\nwaves on the surface of liquid [14] and for optical turbu-\nlence [16], yielding results that are in a good agreement\nwith the \u2018\u2018exact\u2019\u2019 WT theory. To accord more accurately\nwith the real conditions of the experiment, we introduce\ninto Eq. (1) (below) a viscous damping term for waves at\nall frequencies, in addition to the nonlinear term.\nCapillary turbulence has not hitherto been studied using\nthis approach.\nFollowing the general recommendations of\nRefs. [14,16] we write the corresponding equation for\nthe envelope curve of the turbulent spectrum as\n@n!\n@t\n\u0001 C\n!4=3\n@\n@!\n\u0001\n!7n!\n@\n@!\n\u0002!n!\u0003\n\u0002\n\t 2\u000f!n! \n f!\u0002t\u0003:\n(1)\nFor convenience in comparing numerical results with our\nexperimental data, we use the occupation number in !\nrepresentation, n!\u0002t\u0003 \u0001 nk\u0002t\u0003jk\u0001k\u0002!\u0003, as the main charac-\nteristic of the turbulent distribution, where k \u0001 k\u0002!\u0003 is\nthe function inverse to the dispersion law for the capillary\nwaves ! \u0001 !k.

For capillary waves\nthe correlation function I! \u0001 constn! has the same scal-\ning properties as n!. In our simulations we renormalized\ntime by a dimensional constant, t! t=C and renormal-\nized frequency, !! C!. We have assumed a renormal-\nized driving frequency !d=2\u0012 \u0001 100 to facilitate\ncomparison of our numerical modeling results for the\nfree decay shown in Fig. 2 with the experimental data\nof Fig. 1. The full curve shows the envelope of the initial\nsteady-state turbulent distribution n!. For the frequency\nrange 200<!=2\u0012< 800 it can evidently be approxi-\nmated by a powerlike dependence n! \b!\t7=2, in good\nagreement both with the existing theory of capillary\nturbulence [6,7] and with our current and previous ex-\nperimental observations [10]. The cutoff in the power\nspectrum at the frequency !b=2\u0012 \r 800 is caused by\nviscosity. The dashed and dotted curves show the evolu-\ntion of the envelope after the driving force was removed.\nThe destruction of the powerlike dependence clearly\nbegins from the high frequency domain of the turbulent\nspectrum. The energy of the oscillations is concentrated\nmainly in the low frequency spectral domain. That there\nis no destructive front propagating from low to high\nfrequencies is entirely consistent with our experimental\nresults.074501-3These results may be explained qualitatively in terms\nof the general theory of WT if we assume a fast redis-\ntribution of energy between different frequency scales\ninside the inertial range, leading to suppression of relaxa-\ntion processes. Such a redistribution will stabilize the\npowerlike dependence of the turbulent spectrum at low\nfrequencies. A similar evolution of the turbulent spec-\ntrum was observed in [11] with a smooth decrease of\ndriving amplitude, where the turbulent system remained\ncontinuously in its steady state. Based on these observa-\ntions we can claim that the evolution of the freely decay-\ning turbulent spectrum has a quasiadiabatic character.\nThe kinetic time of nonlinear wave interactions \u0015k\u0002!\u0003\nplays the role of a fast time; the time \u0015v\u0002!\u0003, characteriz-\ning viscous damping of the waves, plays the role of a slow\ntime within the inertial frequency range. From (1) one\ncan estimate the frequency dependences of \u0015k\u0002!\u0003 \/ !\t7=6\nand \u0015v\u0002!\u0003 \/ !\t4=3, and of their ratio as r\u0002!\u0003 \u0001 \u0015k\u0002!\u0003=\n\u0015v\u0002!\u0003 \/ \u0002!=!b\u00031=6. It was shown in [11] that the inertial\nrange is limited at high frequencies by the condition\nr\u0002!b\u0003 \b 1, and that inside the inertial range the parame-\nter r is small, i.e., nonlinear wave interactions occur\nfaster than the viscous damping processes. At these fre-\nquencies the ratio r\u0002!\u0003 can be considered as a small\nadiabatic parameter. At frequencies of the order of !b,\nr\u0002!b\u0003 \b 1, so that the nonlinear and viscous processes\nhave comparable rates, and the adiabatic condition is\nviolated. During the decay process the amplitudes of\nthe waves decrease, so the kinetic time decreases as\nwell [10,11], hence the shift of the boundary frequency\n!b towards the low frequency domain. At large times\nafter the beginning of the decay, !b becomes comparable\nwith the driving frequency !d. Dissipation is then start-074501-3\nVOLUME 93, NUMBER 7 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S\nweek ending\n13 AUGUST 2004ing to play an important role even at low frequencies.\nThus we can claim that, for the understanding of nonsta-\ntionary turbulent processes, viscous losses in a turbulent\nsystem are of central importance at all frequencies above\nthe driving frequency: we have seen, both in experiments\nand in computations, that finite damping of the waves\nchanges qualitatively the character of the turbulent decay\ncompared to the scenario envisaged earlier. Note that\nthese considerations do not apply to stationary turbulent\nphenomena, where dissipation can be neglected com-\npletely over a wide range of frequencies [8,9].\nConclusion.\u2014Our experimental observations and nu-\nmerical calculations have shown that the decay of capil-\nlary turbulence on the surface of a normal liquid begins\nwith the damping of high frequency waves, so that the\nhigh frequency part of the powerlike turbulent spectrum\nis destroyed first. The energy-containing range of fre-\nquencies does not shift toward high frequencies in prac-\ntice, but remains at frequencies of the order of the driving\nfrequency. This remains true at all times during the\ndecay, even at large times when the turbulent regime is\nreplaced by the viscous damping of the waves. Transition\nprocesses in the turbulent system are damped by the fast\nnonlinear redistribution of energy between waves whose\nfrequencies are inside the inertial range. These general\nconclusions may be useful for future studies of nonsta-\ntionary turbulent processes in a wide class of problems,\ne.g., in hydrodynamics, nonlinear sound in solids and\nliquids, astrophysics, and plasma physics. In particular,\nour results support the phenomenological propositions\nmade in [21] to account for the observed long-time prop-\nerties of vorticity in the decay of quantum turbulence in\nsuperfluid helium. They could be also useful in relation to\nrecent studies [18] of damping of the monochromatic\ncapillary wave on a liquid surface.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with V. E.\nZakharov, E. A.
