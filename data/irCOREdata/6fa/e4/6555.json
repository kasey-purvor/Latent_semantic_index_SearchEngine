Such a platform could not only provide a consistent educational\n'experience' for teachers and learners throughout their lives, but it could also provide\nadministration and managerial support, all of which can be tailored to individual\nrequirements.\nThis paper reviews the work carried out within BT's Education and Training Research\nProgramme over the past three years in developing a generic platform for online distance\nlearning. The first section of the paper reviews the original objectives of the Generic\nLearning Platform (GLP) and the context of the education and training research within\nBT. Following this, a description of the Real time Interactive Social Environment (RISE)\nplatform is provided including the technical components of RISE.\nOver the past three years the research team have carried out a number of trials using RISE.\nEach of these intended to stretch the overall architecture and our own understanding of\nwhat enables successful distance learning across a range of educational settings. An\noverview of each of these trials is given and the implications for implementing a GLP.\nFinally this paper closes with some comments on the future of RISE.\n17\nMichael Gardner and Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments: a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nThe meaning of generic\nIn the context of our work, we define 'generic' as a solution that is not dependent upon any\nparticular individual's learning stage, be it at school, college, university or work. Such a\ndefinition is essential to support meaningfully the notion of lifelong learning. The concept\nof learning being generic has two important implications. First it assumes that there is\ngreater commonality rather than differences at the developmental stages of learning\nthroughout most of our lives. The learning process is essentially universal, although it may\nrequire degrees of customization to meet some of the specific needs of the learners at their\ndifferent developmental stages, situations or locations. Many of these learning issues will\nbe addressed in the next section.\nGeneric solutions also make considerable commercial sense. Solutions specifically designed\nfor each sector (i.e. schools, colleges, universities and learning for leisure) are expensive and\nmay not facilitate movement between sectors as required by a lifelong learning scenario. A\ngeneric solution recognizes a common core which may be customized to suit the needs of a\nsector (see section on the platform for more details on customization). Finally the term\n'generic' is also making a statement about content that has both educational and\ncommercial implications. Content is the critical component that needs to change to reflect\nthe differing educational requirement - it cannot be generic across sector, at best it is\ncommon for a single homogeneous group of learners. The GLP, with respect to content at\nleast, must be considered as a generic 'shell' into which appropriate content can be\nadded. Commercially this also makes sense as BT does not consider itself as a content\nprovider and works with third parties who have a high reputation in the area of content\nprovision.\nOur aim therefore was to produce a platform that was sufficiently generic to allow the\n'reuse' of basic or core components across the market sectors, thus keeping development\ncosts down, and sufficiently universal in terms of learning to provide a shell that requires\nthe minimum of customization. To achieve this aim requires a conceptual framework that\nserves as a bridge between the theoretical academic educational research and the\npracticalities of implementing real distance learning systems. It can also provide a\nconsistent framework for the design of systems and an evaluation framework in which to\nassess them. A true test of the generic nature of the platform is best assessed through\nempirical trials. Trials of the GLP in the higher education, further education and school\nsectors are described in later sections.\nThe meaning of learning\nThe theoretical background and underpinning for the GLP was provided by Mayes's\n'learning framework' (1994). The original Mayes framework (1994)1 is illustrated in Figure\n1 and can be summarized in the following way:\n\u2022 Conceptualization: this refers to the student's initial contact with learning material.\nThis could be achieved by attending a lecture or seminar, reading textbooks, watching\ntelevision, listening to the radio or by using multimedia material on the Web.\n\u2022 Construction: at this stage students build on the concepts learnt in the\nconceptualization phase and refine their understanding by working on further tests and\n18\nAJt-J Volume 7 Number 3\nexamples. This could be achieved by carrying out laboratory experiments or working\non practical homework, or using multimedia learning materials.\nDialogue: at this stage students refine their understanding through dialogue and\ndiscussion. This could be achieved by participating in tutorials or having informal and\nsometimes impromptu conversations. On the Web this could be supported by using\nshared whiteboards, conferencing tools (e.g., audio, video, data conferencing etc.) more\ncomplex shared spaces, or discussion groups.\nOrientation\nExploration\nExperimentation\n. Conceptualisation j\nDiscussion\nReflection\nReification\n. Dialogue ,\nTHE\nLEARNING\nCYCLE\nU\u2014\nSelecting\nLinking\nClassifying\n. Construction ,\nFigure I: Mayes's conceptual framework\nIn general within the sphere of commercial distance learning platforms there has been\nmuch greater emphasis on supporting conceptualization, much of it through the\ndevelopment of multimedia Web and CD-ROM content. There tend to be fewer tools to\nsupport construction and dialogue as part of an overall educational process. It is for this\nreason and also the suitability of the constructionist approach to distance learning, i.e. a\nlearner-centred approach, that much of the team's research is aimed at supporting\nconstruction and dialogue within this overall educational framework. The key is to identify\nand support the complete end-to-end 'education process' rather than focus primarily on\nthe end-products of education, e.g. teaching and learning content. The initial requirement\ntherefore for the GLP was that it would support the three-stage Mayes model.\nFrom a commercial perspective the GLP is attractive to BT because it could provide a\nsingle service platform which could be used to provide tailored services to different market\nsectors, i.e. higher and further education (HE\/FE), schools, home etc. In this context the\n19\nMichael Gardner and Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments: a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nplatform would need to support a much wider range of functions than just those covered in\nMayes's model. A service definition for the FE sector, as shown in Figure 2, illustrates this.\nCompetency \u2022 Job Profile\nAnalvsis \u2022 Analysis\nBT Home Page\n\u2022 NVQ \u2022 I\n\u2022 Analysis I\nEducation Mall\ne^arning Style I Direct Access\nAnalvsis I i\nRegistration\/Authentication\nCollege Complete Resource Portfolio\nBusiness Humanities An & Design\nContemporary Studies Engineering Corporate & SME\nEDUCATIONAL SUPPORT |\nCounselling, remedial work 1\nDiagnostic tools I\nBROKERAGE\n| ADMINISTRATION\nI Records & Support\n1 Billing\n1\nI|\nFigure 2: A typical service definition for the FE sector\nIn this diagram the service definition is made up of five key components:\n\u2022 Access point: in its simplest form this could be a homepage, but could be more complex\nif considered as part of a larger range of online educational services.\n\u2022 Analysis and profiling: tools need to be provided to assist a student or teacher to gain\naccess to the appropriate online resources. For example this can include competency,\njob profile, or learning style analysis, or it could be based on a defined curriculum, e.g.\na National Vocational Qualification (NVQ), or direct access to online resources using\nadvanced search and retrieval tools.\n\u2022 Administration: this can be the most important component for educational\ninstitutions, and will include the user registration and authentication process, tracking,\nsupport, billing and content provision.\n\u2022 Online resources: there will need to be a method for classifying online learning\nresources and structuring the methods of access. Also in its widest context, online\nresources can include multimedia content, live and pre-recorded lectures, real people,\ne.g. tutors, and also resources generated by the students themselves.\n\u2022 Support functions: these will include a range of support functions such as access to\ntutors and mentors, counselling and remedial tools.\nThe BT generic learning platform therefore needed to support not only the Mayes\nconceptual framework, but also other functions, as defined above, that are necessary to\nprovide a complete online service.\n20\nAk-J Volume 7 Number 3\nDevelopment of the RISE platform\nRISE is the instantiation of the GLP that we have developed at BT. Its development has\nbeen an iterative process based on a series of trials. These trials were deliberately chosen to\nstretch the platform and so lead to a better understanding of the issues involved in\ndeveloping a GLP. This section describes the development of the RISE GLP through\nresearch trials.\nRISE architecture\nThe RISE system had to provide the following core functions:\n\u2022 Personalized access to online information based on the online group of students, tutors\nand support staff. Each person would have a personalized information space\nrepresenting their role within the group and the actual work that they had each\ncompleted.\n\u2022 A virtual classroom or meeting-place which could provide access to good-quality multi-\nparty audio conferencing between participants, and the ability for users to share\ninformation and record their conferences.\n\u2022 Public and private information spaces where students could store their audio-\nrecordings and coursework.\n\u2022 An online shared diary to enable participants to plan their schedules online.\n\u2022 Access to a modular set of coursework based on defined stages, modules and checkpoints,\nplus tools to enable the teaching staff to update and manage the course materials.\n\u2022 Email and text discussion groups.\n\u2022 Personalized home pages.\nTo meet these requirements RISE required three essential features: the integration of an\naudio conferencing capability with the Web; a dynamic database-driven Web server which\ncould be personalized to each individual user; an online dynamically updating Web\nMeeting Place. The RISE architecture is illustrated in Figure 3.\nRISE is designed around the combination of a data-driven Web server and an audio-\nconferencing server. The Web server is a standard Microsoft Internet Information Server\n(IIS) on a Windows NT platform. All of the RISE application software is written in Apple\nWebObjects. WebObjects builds the Web pages dynamically according to the business rules\nin the RISE application and the underlying data in the Oracle database. In addition to the\nRISE application there is a separate ConfMan application that manages all conferences\nand acts as an interface to the Aculab Millennium audio-conferencing platform. The\nAculab Millennium is connected to two ISDN-30 lines that will support at any one time up\nto 60 callers in conferences. Also there is a separate Java server application called REEL.\nThis provides a Web page-sharing capability to users in a conference. Using a simple Java\nApplet conference participants can push Web pages to each other's browsers. Users of\nRISE only require a Java-enabled Web browser, e.g. Internet Explorer 3+ or Netscape 3+.\nNo additional client-side software is required.\n21\nAk-J Volume 7 Number 2\nOracle Datahav.' ..\nAudioconf\nBridge\n(Acokb)\nConfraan\nI\n-RISE,\"\n.'\u2022Web '\u2022'\nI\nr\n, W e b '\u2022\u2022\u2022\nBrowser*\n.'\".\"\"Reel-.*'\n\u2022 server?\nr\n'\"\/Reel'-'-\n\u2022:.'Q'ava) .-\u2022\ni r\n1\n Web\n-Browser*\nr\nReel\n\" (Java)\nfigure 3: R\/SE architecture\nThe key to RISE is the underlying database and the structure of the data schema. Figure 4\nshows the data schema used in the Merlin trial. In many ways the success of the GLP will\nbe dependent on the richness and flexibility of this data schema to support a range of\ndifferent distance learning scenarios. Irrespective of the other technologies used, the data\nschema defines the distance learning model for the GLP and should be at the core of any\nnew online service.\nRISE is built around the ability to create any number of separate closed user groups. Using\na number of Web-based online forms a system administrator can create and configure a\nclosed user. For each group, the administrator must configure the group, the roles of users\nin the group, e.g. tutor, student, administrator, etc. and the layout and functions available\nto the group. In this way RISE can be used to create a customized system to support a\nclosed user group of individuals. By using the database to build dynamically the online\npages for each user it is relatively easy to administer the RISE groups based on the\ndatabase schema and the customizable options available in RISE. Merlin represents one\nsuch closed user group and the Merlin requirements influenced the development of the\nfirst version of RISE. However, it was recognized from the start that any GLP must\nsupport a large range of different course and learning models, which is why a range of\ndifferent trials were carried out in order to extend the capabilities of the RISE GLP.\nRISE interface and functionality\nThe user must first log into RISE with their username and password and the group that\nthey belong to. Once successfully logged in, the user will be presented with two windows,\nsee Figure 5. The larger window contains a toolbar and a workspace area. The toolbar\nbuttons and the 'look and feel' of this window are all dynamically configured for each\ngroup. The smaller window is the Web Meeting Place and allows users to see who else is\nonline in their group, enabling them to initiate and take part in audio-conferences with\nother users. Once in a conference, users can record their conversation, invite other people,\nand control the privacy of the conference. They can also share Web pages with one another\nusing the REEL Applet, see Figure 6. BT has secured two patents on the RISE system\nconcerning the way the Meeting Place is used to control audio conferences and the use of\nthe REEL application to share Web pages. RISE also provides email and discussion group\nfacilities for all users within the group.\n22\nAk-J Volume 7 Number 3\nFigure 4: The Merlin Data Model\nENOUIRY_TYPE STUDENT_REPORIS PERSON TERMINAL\n.FACILITIES\nPERSON.CONFEREN\nCE\nf\n1-M\nENQUIRIES\n7\/\nM.PERSON\nPERSON.GROUPS\nM-l\n* _\nTERMINAL^FACILTTI\nES\nGROUPS\nHOTJJNKSJYPE\nCONFERENCE.REOU\nST\nCOURSE.HOI.UNK\nS\nCOURSES\nEVENT.TYPE\nPERSON.PATHWAY\nPAIHWAY.STEP\nSIAGE.PATHWAY\nPERSON.STEP PERSON.STAGE\nSTEP\nDirection of relallonshlp\n23\nMichael Gardner and Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nFigure 5: R\/SE screens\nNons\nhapj'\/wwwbtinfemBlcom\/\niwSwjmaosoi\nSaw\nI Figure 6: Reel Applet\nWindow\nAs part of the RISE core functionality each user has access to their own private folder and\na shared folder which is available to everyone in the same group. These folders can be used\nto store any work completed by individuals in the group. Work items can include audio-\nrecordings from RISE conferences or any uploaded computer file. Users can easily upload\nfiles from their own PC into these folders for their own use, to share with the tutor, or to\nshare with the whole group. When audio-conferences are recorded the system converts\nthem automatically into RealAudio format. This allows users to stream the audio file back\nto their PC when they want to listen to it, rather than downloading a large file to their PC.\nUsers can also email the URL of the recording to another person.\nIn addition to the RISE Meeting Place, the students and teachers also needed a way of\nscheduling when they would be online, and organizing conferences with one another. It is\n24\nAit-] Volume 7 Number 3\npossible to organize conferences formally using asynchronous tools such as email.\nHowever, this can be inappropriate if students or teachers want to organize informally\ntheir 'online time' to ensure that they will be online when others in their group are also\nonline. To meet this need we developed a shared online diary in RISE, see Figure 7. This\nallowed users to publicize when they intended to be online. Students could organize their\nuse of the system when others would also be online. This type of informal groupware\nsupport is crucial to the success of any distance learning group.\nFigure 7: The Merlin Diary\nThe testing of RISE\nThe first use of RISE was in the Merlin trial (Miller, 1996) which ran from October 1996\nthrough to June 1997. The Merlin project was a collaborative project between BT and the\nUniversity of Hull Language Institute. It was primarily designed around a 16-week English\nas a Foreign Language (EFL) course delivered online to 40 students world-wide. Merlin\nwas influential as it defined the requirements for the first version of RISE and provided the\ncore features for all subsequent trials. Merlin also set the model for future collaborations,\nwhereby BT acted as a service provider of RISE to an educational organization. Through\nthese trials we learnt a lot about how this relationship could work effectively, how to\nfacilitate the understanding of requirements and how to enable essentially non-technical\nteaching organizations effectively to deliver courses online via the Web.\nMerlin required the following core features:\n\u2022 Conceptualization: a 16-week modular course with assessment points. The content for\nthe course would be released at set periods under the control of the tutors.\n\u2022 Construction: students had to be able to practise their English with a peer group and\ntutors, be able to record their spoken work and share it with others on the course. They\nhad to complete a range of online exercises and save results as well as access standard\ncourse materials.\n25\nMichael Gardner ond Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments: a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\n\u2022 Dialogue: students and tutors had to be able to hold both formal and informal\nmeetings using audio conferencing and be able to share information online.\nThe Merlin trial had distinct requirements in terms of the provision of online courseware\nto the students. The EFL course was based on a 'pathway' of eight separate stages with\ncheckpoints at the end of each stage, e.g. a formally assessed exercise. Within each stage\nwere a number of separate modules that students could work through to enable them to\ncomplete the stage. The key for RISE in this scenario was to enable the course deliverers,\nHull University, to manage their courseware and the extrinsic course process. A number of\ncourse management tools were developed to meet this end. These tools allowed the Hull\nteam to add dynamically new modules and exercises using bespoke administrator forms. In\nthis way the course material could be released over the 16-week period and the tutors could\ndynamically update the material based on students' progress and lessons learnt from the\nstudents' use of the previous courseware. We also provided the Hull team with a basic\nApplications Programming Interface (API) which allowed them to develop course material\nwhich included online exercises. The API allowed the courseware team to define these\nexercises in a way that allowed the students to store their answers to the exercises in the\nMerlin workbook areas, and index these answers against the specific part of the EFL\npathway that they came from. In summary, these tools allowed the course providers to have\ncomplete control over the online courseware and be able to build assessable course\nexercises, which could be tracked against each student. In addition to using these tools, any\nWeb-based content could also be linked into the system as courseware or as an online\nresource.\nThe Merlin trial had fairly specific requirements for the EFL course based on a strict\nmodular course structure and a rigid curriculum. This type of formal course structure is\nfairly commonplace. There are many similarities to other school and HE-based curricula.\nHowever, particularly in vocational courses there is a need to support a much more flexible\ncourse structure, one where the emphasis is more on the learner to assemble evidence of\nparticular competencies that can then be assessed by a tutor, e.g. a student undertaking an\nNVQ. In 1997, BT ran a second trial using the RISE platform in collaboration with Northern\nColleges Network (NCN), a group of FE colleges in the Northumberland region. In addition\nto testing the core technologies, the key objectives of this trial were to evaluate the usability\nof a GLP in the FE sector, increase awareness of online learning throughout the FE sector\nand provide early indications of the acceptability of technology for online learning. In\naddition to this the team investigated the effects of organizational factors on implementation\nof online learning (Ward, Tracey and Barker, 1998).\nDuring this trial the BT team worked closely with the NCN tutors and administrators to\ndevelop a version of RISE to deliver the NVQ Level II in Information Technology. The key\nrequirement for the RISE platform in this instance was the need to support the NVQ process.\nTo meet this end, a number of enhancements were required. This included an NVQ Schedule\nManagement Tool to allow students to monitor and update their progress against all\nelements of their NVQ. Tutors could also use the tool to oversee and monitor the students'\nprogress and update the schedule when necessary, e.g. following formal assessment.\nAnother requirement from the NVQ process was fully to support the collection and\nassessment of student evidence documents. In Merlin, Personal and Group 'workbooks'\n26\nAlt-J Volume 7 Number 3\nwere provided to allow users to store items such as recordings of conferences and\ncompleted coursework. The NVQ process required that the system could more formally\nsupport the process of capturing, sharing and assessing evidence material. To meet this\nneed four 'workbook' areas were created:\n\u2022 an 'audio-evidence' folder, where students could save private recordings from audio\nconferences;\n\u2022 a 'meeting records' area, where users could save shared meeting recordings;\n\u2022 a 'progress review' area, where students could upload documents related to the formal\nNVQ progress reviews;\n\u2022 a 'text evidence' folder, which could be used by students to maintain a store of all their\ndocuments related to the evidence required.\nThe access privileges to all of these folders were managed by the RISE system to ensure\nthat students only had access to their own records, and tutors could access all records for\nall of their students.\nSo far the RISE platform had only been used to support formal distance learning courses\nbased on a curriculum of task activities and formalized assessment points. The next key\nquestion was whether the GLP could be applied to less formalized learning communities,\nwhere rather than supporting a set curriculum the GLP needs to support the general\ncommunications and learning needs of the community. To investigate this scenario the\nHomeLearn trial was initiated. This was a collaboration between BT and Apple Computer\nInc. and used Wickham Market Primary School in Suffolk as the case study (James, 1999;\nTracey, Fowler and Penn, 1999). The aim was to investigate how RISE could be used to\nsupport the relationship between home and school. Students from Years 5 and 6 and their\nfamilies participated in the trial. They were provided with a PC and an Internet connection\nat home. RISE accounts were created for teachers, students, their families and a school\ngovernor. No additional 'content' was created to support this trial as an explicit course was\nnot being run. Instead the team investigated the communication needs of participants. To\nmeet this requirement RISE was extended to include facilities for:\n\u2022 Tracking and managing students' homework. The teacher could create, assign and monitor\nhomework for the trial students. Students could track their homework and parents could\nmonitor their child's homework and electronically authorize it as being 'seen'.\n\u2022 Publication and sharing of school's long- and medium-term plans. A tool was\ndeveloped to allow the teacher to create daily short-term plans and publish them for the\ntrial community.\n\u2022 Discussion group areas were extended to allow a greater variety of discussion areas.\nSome were only open to distinct user sub-groups, e.g. children-only or parent-only. This\nalso included project-specific individual and group folder areas, which could be used to\nsupport specific activities.\n\u2022 The RISE conferencing facility was extended to allow invited experts to attend specially\norganized conferences as part of the students' project work, e.g. a meteorologist in the\ngeography class.\n27\nMichael Gardner and Holfy Ward Real-time interactive social environments a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nA further RISE trial was conducted in collaboration with the University of the Highlands\nand Islands (UHI) in 1999. This used the RISE general purpose group and conferencing\nfacilities to support the delivery of online lectures to a group of students undertaking a\nsoftware engineering B.Sc. course. Students and lecturer would log into RISE and join\ntogether in an audio conference using the RISE Meeting Place. Once in a conference, the\nlecturer would use the REEL tool to 'push' lecture slides to each student's Web browser\nwhilst giving the lecture as an audio conference. In addition to the UHI trial with RISE,\nthe BT team have developed a number of other tools as part of an Advanced Learning\nEnvironments (ALE) project to assist in the capture and synchronization of slides and\naudio and in archiving and distributing lecture material (see Mudhar and Fowler, 1999).\nOur final trial is ongoing and involves working with Suffolk College on a European Social\nFund (Adapt) project, COVETS, to develop a Televersity' platform for Suffolk. At the\nheart of the system will be Solstra (http:\/\/www.solstra.com\/), which will provide all of the\nuser registration and content provision aspects. RISE will be integrated into this system to\nprovide support for the community conferencing and the upload and sharing of individual\nand group work. The plan is to test this platform through some early trials based on\nspecific courses, but widen this out to address many of the issues raised by the UK\nGovernment University for Industry (UFI) initiative. A particular focus will be on\nproviding education and training to meet the needs of a wide range of different people in\nthe community and laying some of the foundations for the support of lifelong learning.\nThis section has described the development of the RISE Generic Learning Platform based\non a number of trials with different educational contexts. The next section highlights some\nof the key findings from the evaluation of some of these trials.\nKey findings from trials\nSystem usability\nAs with any experimental software the trials encountered some technical problems. Those\nhighlighted in the early trials were overcome and RISE was refined for the following trial.\nThe key problem, identified during the Merlin trial, surrounded the issue of integration.\nUsers were uncomfortable using several applications at the same time and frequently\nrequested a combined user interface from which to launch all applications. To resolve this\nFirstClass and RISE were integrated into the same browser for the NCN trial. The result\nwas positive feedback from the users. This demonstrated that RISE was a tool with an\nacceptable level of hidden technology, the user simply logged on and completed a task\nwithout identifying that they were using two different applications.\nMany of the users expressed a desire to have multi-party video conferencing facilities built\nin to the RISE platform in addition to the audio conferencing tools already available. Prior\nresearch had indicated that users were less interested in 'seeing' one another than they were\nin actually completing the task at hand, e.g. sharing a Web page, and preferred better\nquality audio and faster data-sharing facilities than a video image. During the UHI trial\nBT carried out a comparison of lectures delivered using video conferencing to those\ndelivered over the audio link built in to RISE. The students reported that the quality of the\nvideo conferencing was very poor but they still felt that actually being able to see their\nlecturer was beneficial. However, the lecturer suggested that video conferencing 'didn't add\n28 \u2022\nAlt-J Volume 7 Number 3\na huge amount over audio conferencing'. He was comfortable using RISE to deliver and\nsupport his slide material. Despite students' early concerns, at the end of the trial all of the\nstudents 'preferred using RISE to the video conferencing' (Tracey, 1999).\nIt should be noted that students who were already friends or had met their tutor prior to\nthe trials were comfortable conferencing without a video image. Only those who had no\nprevious contact were initially uncomfortable with an audio link alone. Many users\ncommented that making contact with a complete stranger is much harder in a 'virtual'\nenvironment than it is in a 'real' classroom. However, as the users familiarized themselves\nwith the system, the course and their peer group, their confidence grew and their need for\nthe visual cues changed. This highlighted the need for a coherent induction process to any\ncourse delivered online.\nAll users used the email actively and found this to be of huge benefit. Students on the UHI\ntrial found this useful as the lecturer was not always online for synchronous\ncommunication, but by leaving a text message using FirstClass the students were confident\nthat they would receive a prompt response: 'It was very convenient getting in touch with\nhim [the lecturer] by email.'\nOn a similar BT research collaboration based in Essex, the School Centred Initial Teacher\nTraining (SCITT) course, tutors actively encouraged remote PGCE students to submit\nassignments using FirstClass. This was eventually made compulsory and the course\nmanager identified several reasons for this, including the ability to save and file the\nassignments on the FirstClass server, establish group folders with restricted access for\nsecurity, and the ability to trace the history of messages. Participants on the NCN trial\nidentified the same benefits.\nTeaching staff experiences\nBy implementing an online service to deliver and manage a course or series of courses the\nteaching staff found that their roles changed slightly. They highlighted the issue that they\nwere now expected to be first-line technical support for the student groups regardless of\ntheir main subject area. Educational institutions need to review this requirement prior to\nthe implementation of a RISE-type platform to deliver or enhance any course.\nHowever, technical support aside, estimates from the workload of staff, specifically from\nthe Merlin trial, indicated that a tutor could support a larger student group online than in\na classroom-based course with a similar input of hours. However, educational institutions\nmust be aware that an increasing number of students increases the level of administrative\nsupport required.\nStaff also found that they built stronger working relationships with students during the\ntrial. In particular during the Merlin trial the tutor's role was that of a facilitator rather\nthan course leader. Due to this and the increased opportunities for one-to-one online\ncontact the tutor commented that 'there were more opportunities to get to know students'.\nThe feeling of being better able to address the individual needs of students was common\namongst staff in the NCN, Merlin and HomeLearn trials.\nStudents' feedback\nFor all students who took part in the RISE trials the concept of delivering or participating\nin an online lecture was a new experience. Many of the staff and students expressed\n29\nMichael Gardner and Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nconcerns about what to expect from the system. Even students who considered themselves\nto be technically competent were wary of how the trial would run. For example one of the\nstudents from the UHI trial commented: 'It was a bit of the unknown really. To be quite\nhonest I was a bit unsure about it, I just didn't think it would be as good as somebody\nstanding there in front of a blackboard.'\nHowever, the advantages of a GLP, in particular the flexible working opportunities, soon\noutweighed the initial concerns. All the students who participated in the UHI trial wanted\nto use a RISE-type platform again. While this was an experimental platform, the students\nwere undertaking a real course and they achieved 100 per cent pass rate while using RISE.\nOne of the early questions in all these trials addressed the issue of student-tutor\ninteraction. How would it be affected by the technology? The majority of HE\/FE students\nconsidered the amount of support or contact with their tutor or lecturer compared\nfavourably with that from classroom teachers. For Merlin students the spoken contact with\nthe tutor was more enjoyable and beneficial than in classrooms. For the students\nparticipating in the NCN trial the ability to send and receive emails and book online\nmeetings with their tutor was essential and they felt they received better attention than if\nthey were in a group tutorial or meeting. NVQs usually involve less contact with a tutor\nand according to the students the introduction of RISE had improved this level of\ninteraction.\nLearning gains\nThe objectives for the students during the NCN trial included using RISE to download\ncourseware related to their NVQ, begin the exercises and start to gather evidence towards\ntheir NVQ. Three-quarters of the students had downloaded courseware and one-third had\nreached the stage of submitting evidence. Over 80 per cent of the student group felt that\nthey had benefit in terms of ICT skills, knowledge of GLPs and general confidence levels\nusing a GLP (Ward, Tracey and Barker, 1998). Of the RISE trials this was the only\ninstance where students participated voluntarily and the trial was in addition to their work\nand study commitments. All other trials were delivering 'live' courses.\nThe use of RISE in the community environment during the HomeLearn trial increased the\nstudents' access to resources. For example, an audio conference with the author of their\ncurrent English textbook was arranged after school as a homework assignment. The\nchildren had the opportunity to ask the author specific questions and engage in\nspontaneous debate following the answers. This and other similar activities not only\nenabled the students to complete their homework but gave them the opportunity to\ndevelop ICT skills, presentation, interpersonal and communication skills and research\nskills. They could achieve all this from their own homes with the support of either friends\nor family as well as receive the support and guidance from teaching staff in the formal\nclassroom environment.\nConclusions\nA GLP works very well as the sole learning environment in a situation whereby the student\nis self-motivated and does not consider the teaching staff to be the sole or principal,\nlearning resource, e.g. Merlin or NCN trials. In this case students manage the majority of\ntheir learning experience. As a communication tool used to bring together communities\n30\nAlt-J Volume 7 Number 3\nthat ordinarily would have less contact, e.g. the school and parents in the HomeLearn trial,\nRISE is very successful but would not replace the formal classroom-based environment\nthat young children require. It can provide an excellent gateway to exploring a global\nresource bank, via the Web and email, to supplement and support the National\nCurriculum, but should not be considered as a replacement for the teacher during\ncompulsory years.\nThe future\nThis paper has reviewed the work done in BT to develop a GLP through the development\nof RISE. BT is now developing a commercial platform that delivers many of the features\nthat were previously provided by RISE, and work is continuing, e.g. COVETS, to extend\nfeatures and coverage of the new commercial platform.\nWith the growing maturity of this area, international standards will have a much larger\npart to play in ensuring that there is consistency in all aspects of distance learning. In\nparticular, the Instructional Management Systems (IMS) Project (1999), an Educom NLII\ninitiative, is developing a specification and software for managing online learning\nresources, where learning resources can include people, educational service companies,\ncontent, tools and activities. With the rapid increase in the availability of online\neducational content a common methodology and language for describing online learning\nresources is required. Content can often be described in many different ways. These\ndescriptive categories are meta-data about the object. Online materials need a similar\nsystem of meta-data.\nStandards are also emerging for the design of the generic learning platform itself, notably\nthe IEEE Learning Technology Systems Architecture (LTSA) as described by Farance and\nTonkel (1998). This Architecture Specification describes the high-level system design and\nthe components of the LTSA. The LTSA specification covers a wide range of systems,\nincluding learning technology, computer-based training, electronic performance support\nsystems, computer-assisted instruction, intelligent tutoring, education and training\ntechnology, and meta-data. The LTSA specification attempts to provide a framework for\nunderstanding existing and future systems, and promotes interoperability and portability\nby identifying critical system interfaces such that any system can comply with the LTSA.\nBT is continuing to carry out research into GLPs, in particular:\n\u2022 investigating new types of content to support collaboration and construction;\n\u2022 addressing psychological issues of distance learning, e.g. how to engage learners, and\nnew literacies required by learners;\n\u2022 understanding the needs of complex learning communities and mapping these through\nto the design of online support systems.\nIn BT, RISE has provided us with a rich understanding of how distance learning can be\neffectively supported and through a variety of trials has shown how a single GLP can\nsupport a range of different learning communities.\n31\nMichael Gardner and Holly Ward Real-time interactive social environments: a review of BTs Generic Learning Platform\nNote\n1\n The framework has been further developed - see Fowler and Mayes in this edition for more\ndetails.\nReferences\nFowler, C.
