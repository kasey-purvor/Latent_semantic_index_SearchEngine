Belyakov, H V Atkinson and S P A Gill, Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, \nUniversity Rd., Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK. \nCrystallographically-facetted void (CFV) formation in lead-free solder-joints has been observed \nafter solidification and during subsequent solid-state ageing.

This paper gives a preliminary report on observations of voids which tend \nto be associated with, and adjacent to, intermetallic compounds in the solder bulk and near-\nsubstrate interface region.

Ageing promotes the CFV clustering and growth. \n \nKey words: lead-free solder, voiding \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nAs a result of environmental issues and consequent legislation, lead-free electronics manufacturing \nhas become a global trend. Environmentally-friendly soldering alloys for the electronics industry \nare under further development in order to optimize their long-time stability and reliability.  \nOne of the major aspects influencing the long-term reliability of solder joints is microstructural \nintegrity. In addition to the formation of non-equilibrium microstructures during the solidification \nof lead-free solders, which results in microstructural heterogeneity compared to lead-containing \nsolders1, it has been reported2,3 that lead-free solder-joints are more likely to develop voiding than \ntraditional lead-containing ones. Voids become troublesome when they form in large quantities, \nreducing the cross-sectional area of the joint2. According to the IPC-610-D4 standard for electronic \nassemblies, the maximum void area should not exceed 25% of the solder-joint cross-section.  \nResearch carried out by Wickham et al. 3 showed that the void level in lead-free PBGA (Plastic Ball \nGrid Array) solder-joints did not exceed 15% regardless of the soldering conditions.  \nAspandiar5 proposed a classification of voids commonly detected in solder joints as follows: \nmacro-voids; planar micro-voids; shrinkage voids; micro via voids; pin-hole voids; and Kirkendall \nvoids. Some of those (shrinkage voids) are unique to the Sn-Ag-Cu solders, and are caused by the \nsolidification sequence5. Voiding in solder-joints has also been investigated by Jang et al.6 who \ndescribed an additional type of voids unique to lead-free assemblies and occurring during solid \nstate ageing. Jang et al. have reported that these voids are always found to be attached to the \nintermetallic particles in the solder matrix, especially to those formed during interfacial processes \nat the interface with the substrate.  \nMany studies of lead-free solders are focused on the interfacial processes during the interaction \nbetween the substrate and the molten solder, resulting in intermetallic layer formation7-9. \nNevertheless, there is a lack of research highlighting the effect of the intermetallic precipitates on \nvoiding within a solder-joint, especially during its ageing. The present paper reports on \ncrystallographically-facetted voiding in lead-free solder-joints during solidification and subsequent \nsolid state ageing. These voids could affect the long-term reliability.   \n \n EXPERIMENTAL METHOD \nFor solder-joint assembly, 99.98% copper plates were used. The plates were cut into coupons with \ndimensions of 20 x 30 x 1mm. The following lead-free alloys were used: SAC405 (Sn95.5 \u2013 Ag4.0 \n\u2013 Cu0.5) by Heraeus GmbH; CASTIN (Sn96.2 \u2013 Ag2.5 \u2013 Cu0.8 \u2013 Sb0.5) and SN100C (Sn \u2013 Cu0.7 \n\u2013 Ni0.05 + Ge) by AIM Ltd. The solder compositions are given in mass%. The joints were \nprepared by the following process: two pieces of polished and cleaned Cu substrates were set \nparallel to each other with a 0.5mm space between them. The soldering paste was filled into the gap \nand reflowed by means of a hot-air gun with an air flow temperature of 280\u00b0C and a time above \nliquidus of 30 seconds. Thermo-profiling was performed by means of a K-type thermocouple \nimmersed into the solder and data monitoring with Labview with a signal reading rate of 4 readings \nper second.   The measured solder-joint cooling rate in the air was about 0.7\u00b0C\/sec. The soldered \nsamples were polished again and cut into small pieces (1 x 5mm) with rectangular cross-section \nusing a diamond cut-off saw.  \nAll the samples were then cold mounted in epoxy resin and then the grinding and polishing was \ncarried out with the following steps: 220 Grit SiC abrasive\u2192 500 Grit \u2192 1000 Grit \u2192 2400 Grit \n\u2192 final polishing using colloidal silica. The prepared cross-sections were not etched. After cross-\nsection preparation, the specimens were examined with Field Emission Gun Scanning Microscopy \n(FEI Sirion 200). Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis was performed by means of a \nHKL Channel 5 detector. Ageing was carried out at 160\u00b0C in a Gallenkamp furnace. The \nspecimens were not broken out of the mounts for ageing. After ageing, samples were repeatedly \npolished to check that the voids observed were not a surface phenomenon. \n \nRESULTS \nDuring microstructural investigations of the lead-free solder-joints, CFVs have been constantly \nobserved in the \u03b2-Sn matrix in the \u2018as soldered state\u2019. For example, Figure 1 shows an SN100C \nalloy solder-joint cross-section in the region near the interface with the substrate.  EBSD analysis \nshowed that the CFV orientation is always correlated with the \u03b2-Sn grain crystallographic \norientation; the CFVs form in a tetragonal shape. Depending on the cross-section plane, they have \nbeen observed as triangles, rectangles, squares or triangles with cut ends. The red tetragonal unit \ncell in Fig. 1 is from the EBSD analysis and shows the crystallographic orientation of the \u03b2-Sn \ngrain in this area. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Correlation between the orientation of the voids and the crystallographic orientation of \nthe \u03b2-Sn (shown inset in the top right and corner and derived from EBSD). The cross-section is \nunetched and is in the \u2018as soldered state\u2019; Sn100C alloy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe CFVs were observed to be preferentially located near the substrate-solder interface, i.e. near \nthe Cu6Sn5\/Cu3Sn intermetallic (IMC) layers, and in the solder bulk close to the IMC particles \nCu6Sn5 and Ag3Sn. Ageing at a relatively high temperature of 160\u00b0C resulted in CFV clustering \nand growth (Figures 2A, B). Figure 2B shows what appears to be a layer-by-layer growth \nmechanism of the CFV. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Scanning Electron Microscopy (secondary electron mode) images of CFVs in solder-\njoints assembled with SAC405 soldering paste and after soldering subjected to annealing at 160\u00b0C \nfor 3720 hours. Cross-sections were not etched before the analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nVoid morphology did not vary significantly between solder-joints assembled with the different \nsolders: SAC405, CASTIN and SN100C.  \nIn order to prove that the CF voiding is not a surface phenomenon, the specimens were repeatedly \nground and polished down through the bulk. Voids were found throughout the solder volume but \nmore copiously near the interface layer with the Cu substrate (i.e. the Cu6Sn5\/Cu3Sn intermetallic \nlayer).  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe fact that the CFVs are facetted suggests that they must form in the solid state not the liquid \nstate. This also suggests that they form by the condensation of vacancies in the matrix. During \nannealing, when the specimens were subjected to exposure at 160\u00baC, diffusion in the Sn plays an \nimportant role in microstructural changes, since Sn is at 85% of its absolute melting point. The \nvacancy concentration is then high and substitutional diffusion rapid. At these temperatures, it \nseems feasible that vacancies could cluster and grow to form voids. This could be in response to a \ndenser phase (the intermetallics) growing within the less dense Sn in the solid state: the coefficients \nof crystal lattice packing and consequently density of the intermetallic particles Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 \nforming in the solder bulk are higher than those of the \u03b2-Sn matrix. During intermetallic precipitate \nformation from the pure components, the resulting volume of the new phase will be less than the \nvolume of the pure components involved in the reaction. For instance, in the case of Cu6Sn5 \nprecipitation, the resulting volume would be about 5.5% less than that of the two pure components \n(according to the rule of mixtures) and about 6% less for Ag3Sn. This contraction upon IMC \nprecipitation will induce a significant tensile stress in the surrounding matrix and a global \nshrinkage in the solder as a whole. The stress gradient directed towards the IMCs serves as a \ndriving force for vacancy migration. \nWe argue here that the stress is arising because of solid state intermetallic precipitation rather than \nas a result of shrinkage during solidification. The phase diagram suggest that liquid forms matrix +  \nCu6Sn5 at a given temperature but this is the equilibrium state. One would expect that the solid \nmatrix forms first from the liquid and the intermetallic then precipitates out subsequently by \nprecipitation and growth i.e. the Cu takes some time subsequent to solidification to diffuse through \nthe matrix to form the precipitates. Our explanation for the voids only holds if the solid matrix \nexists before the precipitates form. If the voids formed during solidification from the liquid state \nthey would be likely to be rounded rather than facetted. \nIt is noteworthy that the IMC Cu6Sn5  has an allotropic transformation at 187.5\u00b0C (\u03b7-Cu6Sn5 \u2192 \u03ae-\nCu6Sn5) and this transformation involves structural reorganization: hexagonal crystal lattice of \u03b7-\nCu6Sn5 (high temperature modification) transforms into monoclinic crystal lattice of  \u03ae-Cu6Sn5 \n(low temperature modification)10. This process is associated with a volume change of the phase. It \noccurs in the solid state immediately after solidification (since solder joints could be super-cooled \ndown to these temperatures) and is expected to introduce additional internal stress due to the \nsubsequent expansion of \u03ae-Cu6Sn5 phase by up to 2.15%11. This mitigates the 5.5% shrinkage effect \nidentified above but the net volume change is still a contraction of 3.35%. It is possible that the \nspecimen is, in effect, supercooled so that the \u03ae-Cu6Sn5 appears almost instantly followed by the \nformation of the voids. Alternatively the \u03b7-Cu6Sn5 may form first, followed by voids and followed \nby the \u03ae-Cu6Sn5 formation.  \nThe intermetallic formation continues in the solid state during solder-joint ageing, since the time \navailable for the transformation during soldering is not sufficient11 and Cu atoms continue to \ndiffuse from the substrates producing more IMCs within the \u03b2-Sn matrix.  \n In order to fully understand the phenomenon of CF void formation in Sn-rich solders, additional \nexperiments and analysis are currently being performed.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nCrystallographically facetted voids have been observed in lead free solder joint subjected to ageing. \nWe argue here that these are due to stress arising as a result of the formation of intermetallics in the \ntin matrix in the solid state, although this stress is mitigated by the allotropic \u03b7-Cu6Sn5 \u2192 \u03ae-Cu6Sn5 \ntransformation. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
