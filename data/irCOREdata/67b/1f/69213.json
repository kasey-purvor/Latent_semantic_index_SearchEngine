Introduction\n[2] Lava flows demonstrate a wide range of behaviors,\nwhich depend on their intrinsic physical properties, the\neruption conditions, and the environment into which they are\nerupted. Studying lava flow processes during emplacement is\ndifficult because of the potential dangers of working near\nactive flows and because the growth of a surface crust pre-\ncludes direct observation of flow dynamics. Crustal growth\nstrongly influences subsequent flow behavior. Crusts may\neither reduce cooling through insulation or enhance it through\nentrainment into the core [Crisp and Baloga, 1990] and can\nalso modify flow advance, depending on their rheology.\nRigid crusts force lava to advance as a series of breakouts,\nproducing characteristic, crust\u2010dominated, p\u0101hoehoe mor-\nphology. In contrast, when the crust is highly fragmented,\nas in \u2019a\u2019\u0101 basalts, advance occurs by the core\u2010dominated\n\u201ccaterpillar\u2010track\u201d mechanism [Kilburn, 1993]. Interactions\nbetween crust and core result in the formation of branches\nand tubes, so are fundamental in flow field evolution [e.g.,\nGreeley, 1987; Lipman and Banks, 1987; Kilburn and Lopes,\n1988, 1991; Fink and Griffiths, 1990]. Because the subsur-\nface flow dynamics are reflected in crustal development,\nstudying crustal evolution can provide insight into core motion\nand flow advance. Flow surface morphology can be used to\nconstrain parameters including eruption rate, flow velocity,\nand local strain rate in unobserved flows [e.g.,Gregg and Fink,\n2000].\n[3] Crust\u2010core interactions are difficult to observe in the\nfield and cannot currently be modeled numerically. Labora-\ntory experiments provide an alternative method of studying\nlava flow behavior and have been employed by many authors\nusing a variety of modeling substances with differing rheol-\nogies. The choice of material depends on the processes being\ninvestigated, as general lava flow evolution is strongly\ndependent upon the initial conditions. For example, Hawaiian\nlavas erupt at high temperatures and low crystallinities (e.g.,\n1140\u00b0C and 0.5%, Mauna Loa, 1984) [Lipman and Banks,\n1987] so their rheologies are initially close to Newtonian.\nTheir development is largely controlled by rapidly increasing\ncore crystallinities and the consequent dramatic changes in\nbulk rheology. In contrast, lavas on Mount Etna, Sicily, erupt\nat lower temperatures and higher crystallinities (e.g., 1086\u00b0C\nand 30%\u201360%, 1975 eruption) [Pinkerton and Sparks, 1978;\nTanguy, 1973], so they already have a significant yield strength.\nTheir emplacement is largely governed by crustal growth.\n[4] Modeling approaches using cooling fluids that develop\nsolid crusts, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) wax [e.g.,\nGreeley and Womer, 1981; Hallworth et al., 1987; Fink and\n1Lancaster Environment Center, Lancaster University, Bailrigg,\nLancaster, UK.\n2Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont\u2010\nFerrand, France.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JB006965\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, B07210, doi:10.1029\/2009JB006965, 2010\nB07210 1 of 15\nGriffiths, 1990, 1992; Blake and Bruno, 2000; Gregg and\nFink, 1995, 2000; Griffiths et al., 2003; Cashman et al.\n2006; Lyman and Kerr, 2006] simulate bulk rheological\nchanges, so are well suited to the study of Hawaiian\u2010style\nflows. PEG crusts scale most appropriately to continuous\np\u0101hoehoe rather than fragmented \u2019a\u2019\u0101 crusts because they are\nthin in comparison to the flow thickness, and their scaled\nstrength is greater than lava crust strength [Fink and Griffiths,\n1990; Soule and Cashman, 2004].\n[5] Isothermal modeling approaches [e.g., Hulme, 1974;\nHuppert et al., 1982; Blake, 1990;Merle, 1998; Buisson and\nMerle, 2005; Lescinsky and Merle, 2005; Balmforth et al.,\n2006] face the problem of adequately simulating solidifica-\ntion. This may be addressed by using yield strength fluids\n[e.g., Hulme, 1974; Blake, 1990] or by combining modeling\nsubstances to produce a rheological stratification [e.g.,\nLescinsky andMerle, 2005]. The latter approach assumes that\nthe rheological contrast between the hottest (core) and coolest\n(surface) endmembers is the most important factor governing\nflow behavior and that layers of intermediate temperature and\nrheology do not significantly influence the system, though\nfield observations of p\u0101hoehoe lavas have been used to sug-\ngest that an intermediate viscoelastic layer is of importance\n[Hon et al., 1994]. Models of this nature may be used to study\nEtnean\u2010type flows, in which development is dominated by\ncrustal growth.\n[6] Here we build on the experiments of Lescinsky and\nMerle [2005] who used viscous silicone with a range of\nsurface crust rheologies, subjected to a range of flow condi-\ntions, to examine strain partitioning and surface fracturing in\nchannelized lava flows. Our work extends their study of\nbrittle crust surface morphologies and also investigates the\ninfluence of crustal thickness and basal slope on the advance\nmechanisms of channelized flows. We aim to evaluate the\nrelative contributions of crust and core to flow behavior and\nadvance by examining the developing surface structures. By\nreproducing morphologies that are found on lava flows, the\nexperiments may be used to interpret crustal structures in\nterms of internal flow dynamics and crust\u2010core interaction.\n2. Experimental Methodology\n2.1. Design\n[7] Our experiments simulated the advance of lava into a\nchannel already containing a flow with or without a brittle\ncrust. The use of channelized geometry follows the study of\nMerle [1998] and Lescinsky and Merle [2005], but there are\nimportant differences in our experimental design. The earlier\nwork examined strain partitioning during spreading, therefore\nlubricated sidewalls were used to eliminate lateral shear in the\nmajority of experiments, and no new material was introduced\ninto any of the experiments. Because our aim was to repro-\nduce the shear and velocity conditions experienced by\nchannelized lava flows as closely as possible, we continually\nintroduced fluid into the experimental channel, which was\ndefined by sand lev\u00e9es.\n[8] Lescinsky and Merle [2005] varied crustal thickness\nand slope in their brittle crust experiments, but the overlap in\nconditions between their models and ours is minimal. The\nintroduction of material into our experimental channels\nresulted in different stress\u2010strain distributions, allowing the\nexamination of a wider range of crustal structures. The range\nof crustal thicknesses used is similar, but we studied a wider\nrange of basal slopes (4\u00b0\u201312\u00b0 compared to 5\u00b0\u20136\u00b0). Gregg\nand Fink [1995, 2000] found that slope significantly modi-\nfied morphological flow regimes identified in PEG flow\nmodels by Fink and Griffiths [1990, 1992].\n[9] The problem of crustal thickening was addressed by the\nuse of a range of crustal thicknesses, simulating lavas at\nvarious stages of emplacement. No single experiment was\ntherefore intended to represent the full development of a lava\nflow. The unchanging rheology also prevented the downslope\npropagation of the lev\u00e9es during an experiment, but because\nof our interest in flow advance mechanisms, spreading\nbeyond the lev\u00e9es was desirable.\n2.2. Materials\n[10] The flow core was simulated by a high viscosity\n(104 Pa s) silicone fluid with Newtonian rheology. Although\nlavas demonstrate pseudoplastic, not Newtonian, rheology\nbelow their liquidus [Shaw, 1969; Pinkerton and Sparks,\n1978], pseudoplastic rheology can be approximated by a\nBingham model over a small range of strain rates. In turn, the\nbehavior of a Newtonian fluid may approximate that of a\nBingham fluid when its yield stress is exceeded. Models\nincorporating any of these rheologies may therefore provide\nuseful insights into flow behavior, if scaled.\n[11] The experimental crusts consisted of a dry mixture of\nquartz sand (negligible cohesion) [Mourgues and Cobbold,\n2003] and plaster of Paris (cohesion of a few hundred\nPascals) [Donnadieu andMerle, 1998], which has been found\nto successfully simulate the behavior of cohesive brittle\nclinker [Lescinsky and Merle, 2005].\n2.3. Method\n[12] Our apparatus consisted of a fluid reservoir with a\nsliding gate mounted at the end of a smooth, flat board\n(Figure 1). The reservoir end of the board was elevated to\nprovide a down\u2010flow slope, and an initial channelized flow\nwas constructed adjacent to the gate, bounded laterally by\nsand lev\u00e9es. The initial flow comprised a silicone sheet (350 \u00d7\n127 \u00d7 15 mm), representing the flow core, overlain by a dry\nmix of sand and plaster, the brittle crust. A volumetric sand to\nplaster ratio of 9:1 was used in four trial experiments (2\u20135),\nbut thereafter, a ratio of 4:1 was found to improve the clarity\nof structures by damping collapse around their edges. The\nsilicone sheet was prepared several hours before an experi-\nFigure 1. The experimental apparatus, showing the initial\nconfiguration of a flow.

During sieving, point\nmeasurements of crustal depth (accurate to \u00b10.5 mm) were\ntaken using a wire probe to ensure as even a thickness as\npossible. Crustal thickness was not monitored during the\nexperiments because the complexity of crustal redistribution\nprevented characterization using point measurements and\nbecause the invasive measuring procedure may have induced\nweaknesses that were exploited as failure sites. Initial crustal\nthicknesses of 0 to 15 mm and slopes of 4\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 were used.\n[13] After construction of the initial flow, black markers for\ntracking deformation (either carbide grains or mustard seeds)\nwere scattered over the flow surface, and the experiment was\nleft to proceed. Although construction of the initial flow took\n5\u201310 min, no appreciable movement of the flow occurred\nduring this time. As the flow advanced downslope over time,\nit was gravity fed at the head of the preformed channel by\nreservoir silicone flowing under the partially open lock gate.\nExperimental duration, limited by the length of the board,\nranged from 5\u201314 h. After an experiment, internal flow\nstructures were examined by removing the crustal material\nusing a soft brush to reveal the silicone core.\n[14] Each experiment was recorded using time\u2010lapse dig-\nital photography. The image sequences allowed both the\ndescription of surface morphological changes and quantita-\ntive monitoring of crustal deformation through the tracking\nof the markers, using a correlation\u2010based feature tracking\nprocedure written in Matlab. Experimental conditions are\nlisted in Table 1.\n2.4. Dimensional Analysis\n[15] To demonstrate similarity between the experiments\nand lava flows, we use a dimensional analysis similar to that\nof Lescinsky andMerle [2005].

Results\n[17] General flow development was similar for all experi-\nments, but the occurrence and appearance of surface struc-\ntures varied with the initial ratio of crust to total flow\nthickness\u220f1 and slope\u220f3. The structures depended strongly\non\u220f1 but only weakly on\u220f3 and included fractures (near the\nflow front and down the channel margins), ridges (near the\nhead of the channel), and flow front lobes. The experiments\nare divided into four classes depending on the observed\nstructures. These are \u201cno\u201d to \u201cvery thin\u201d crusts: \u220f1 \u2264 0.1,\n\u201cthin\u201d crusts: 0.1 <\u220f1 \u2264 0.2, \u201cintermediate\u201d crusts: 0.2 <\u220f1\n\u2264 0.3 and \u201cthick\u201d crusts:\u220f1 > 0.3. The typical development of\na thin and a thick crust experiment are shown in Figure 2.\n[18] At the start of an experiment, the flow front sagged\nand rolled forward under gravity. In all but the \u201cno\/very\nthin\u201d crust models, this caused tensile fractures to open in\nthe surface crust behind the flow front (Figures 2a and 2e).\nExtension was observed at the flow front in the no\/very thin\ncrust models from relative motion of the surface markers.\nFlow front velocities were highest during this initial period\n(Figure 3) before gradually decaying because of frontal\nthinning and, later, lateral spreading beyond the lev\u00e9es\n(Figures 2b and 2f).\n[19] Flow fronts advanced by a caterpillar track mecha-\nnism. The upper, higher velocity part of the flow cascaded\ndown at the front, depositing crustal material that was then\noverrun, resulting in a basal sand layer analogous to the basal\nbreccia observed in \u2019a\u2019\u0101 basalt and higher\u2010silica flows. In\nflows with no crusts (\u220f1 = 0), rollover at the flow front was\nevidenced by the overrunning of marker points.\n[20] Because of the static head, the influx of silicone from\nthe reservoir (which had no surface crust) advanced more\nrapidly than the flow front. In Figure 2, the influx is the\nadvancing transparent region of the flow on the left of the\nimages. The response of the flow to the compression caused\nby the influx depended on \u220f1. In experiments with \u220f1 = 0,\nthe flow thickened near the gate, while in those with \u220f1 =\n0.06 the growth of surface ridges was observed. Compres-\nsional ridges were also seen in all thin (Figures 2b\u20132d) and\nsome intermediate crust experiments but not in thick crust\nexperiments. Marginal shear zone fractures and flow front\nlobes developed in intermediate and thick crust models\n(Figure 2f).\n[21] Increasing the slope \u220f3 tended to lower the \u220f1\nvalues at which structures appeared. For example, experi-\nments with \u201cthin\u201d\u220f1 values conducted at high\u220f3 sometimes\nproduced shear zone fractures and flow front lobes, which are\nclassed as \u201cintermediate\u201d structures. We now consider in\ndetail the structures observed in the different classes of crustal\nthickness.\n3.1. No\/Very Thin Crust Experiments, \u220f1 \u2264 0.1\n(\u220f1 = 0, 0.06)\n[22] For \u220f1 = 0, the silicone surface remained smooth\nthroughout an experiment. Initial extension at the flow front\ncaused thinning of the flow, but no surface discontinuities\ndeveloped. At the head of the channel, the silicone influx\ninduced a compressional stress, hence, a shortening strain,\nwhich resulted in flow thickening. The seam between\nthe initial flow and the reservoir silicone developed a\ncurved cross\u2010channel aspect with time but gradually became\nindistinct.\n[23] For \u220f1 = 0.06, shortening at the channel head was\ninitially accommodated by irregular \u201cripple\u201d structures that\nlater developed into laterally continuous, regularly spaced\ntransverse ridges. These were deformed by the cross\u2010channel\nvelocity profile to become curved in plan view. Over time,\nTable 3.

They eventually reached the flow front\n(Figure 2d).\n[24] The flow front outline remained smooth throughout all\nexperiments. For \u220f1 = 0.06, the core was never exposed\nthrough the crust. Cutting a section through the front of this\nexperiment revealed a simple vertical structure (Figure 4).\n3.2. Thin Crust Experiments, 0.1 < \u220f1 \u2264 0.2 (\u220f1 = 0.17)\n[25] The initial extension of the flow front caused fine,\nclosely spaced tensile fractures to open, which widened with\ntime. The fracture field propagated upflow, where spacing\nincreased slightly, while fracture length decreased, giving\nthe fracture field a curved outline (Figure 5). Later, lateral\nspreading beyond the lev\u00e9es generated new tensile fractures\nthat broke the strips of crust between the original tensile\nfractures into equant crustal \u201cplates\u201d: fracture\u2010bounded ele-\nments of crust that appeared to behave rigidly.\n[26] Compressional ridges again developed ahead of the\nsilicone influx at the channel head. Their greater spacing and\namplitude meant that the transition from irregular ripples to\nregular ridges was clearer than for \u220f1 = 0.06 (Figure 5 and\nTable 4). In cross section, the ridges had smooth, open crests\nand sharp, cuspate troughs.\n[27] As the silicone influx approached the flow front, the\nprevailing stresses in the crust became everywhere com-\npressive, causing the rearmost tensile fractures to close.\nFigure 2. Image sequence illustrating the development of (a\u2013d) a thin crust flow (experiment 19: \u220f1 =\n0.17) and (e\u2013h) a thick crust flow (experiment 20: \u220f1 = 0.5). The reservoir is beyond the left\u2010hand side\nof the images. Early fracturing near the flow front as shown in Figures 2a and 2e was more pronounced\nin thick crusts, in which it was later exploited by upwelling silicone as shown in Figure 2f. The advance\nof the reservoir silicone down the channel resulted in the development of compressional ridges in the thin\ncrust as shown in Figures 2b\u20132d but did not deform the trailing edge of the thick crust as shown in Figures 2f\nand 2g. Late\u2010stage compression, as the reservoir silicone advanced on the flow front, deformed the upwelled\nsilicone ridges in the thick crust as shown in Figures 2g and 2f.Widespread fracturing occurred in both cases\nbut was most obvious in the thick crust (arrows, Figures 2g\u20132h). Markers on the silicone (Figures 2c, 2d, 2g\nand 2h) illustrate the smoothly curved cross\u2010channel velocity profile typical of Newtonian fluids. \u201cCaterpil-\nlar track\u201d motion produced a basal sand layer (bsl in Figure 2d).\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n5 of 15\nLateral spreading and downslope shortening produced a fine\nnetwork of cross\u2010hatching fractures over the whole crust.\nAgain, the flow front outline remained smooth throughout the\nexperiments.\n3.3. Intermediate Crust Experiments, 0.2 < \u220f1 \u2264 0.3\n(\u220f1 = 0.29)\n[28] With increasing \u220f1, the tensile flow front fractures\ndeveloped more rapidly, and their spacing, width, and cur-\nvature generally increased (Figure 6a and Table 4). Curvature\nalso increased upflow from the front. Compressional ridges,\nwhich did not develop in all experiments, had longer wave-\nlengths (Table 4) and were more irregular than for lower \u220f1\nFigure 4. Cross section through the front of a very thin crust\nflow (experiment 24: \u220f1 = 0.06). The vertical structure is\nsimple, with no mixing between crust and core. Rolled over\nsurface markers are visible in the basal sand layer.\nFigure 5. Crustal deformation during the early stages of a\nthin crust flow (experiment 34: \u220f1 = 0.17). (a) A region of\nnarrow tensile fractures developed behind the flow front.\nAs the silicone from the reservoir entered the channel, the\ncrust ahead was compressed, resulting in irregular ripple\nstructures. (b) Fifty minutes later, more regular wavelength\nsurface ridges were discernable. These had smooth, open\ncrests and sharp, cuspate troughs.\nFigure 3.

Advance rates increase with\u220f1. In the absence of crust, the rate of advance slows gradually with\ntime following the initial sagging of the front. When crust is present, a sharp step in the advance shortly after\nthe beginning of the experiment indicates some avalanching of the crust from the flow front. The quantity of\ncrust, hence, the size of the step, increases with \u220f1. A greater quantity of avalanched crust also causes\nincreasingly episodic flow advance.\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n6 of 15\n(Figure 6a). The later generation of cross\u2010hatched fractures\nthat developed under compression were more widely spaced\nand broke the crust into plates. The intersection angle of the\nfractures was 60\u00b0, identifying them as conjugate sets of shear\nfractures.\n[29] Two significant structural differences were observed\nbetween thin and intermediate crust experiments. First, brittle\nfailure of the crust produced oblique, en echelon, synthetic\nshear fractures down the channel margins in all intermediate\ncrust experiments but only in two thin crust examples. The\nfractures were \u223c3 cm long and oriented at \u223c15\u00b0 to the lev\u00e9es\n(Figure 6a). Second, flow front lobes developed in the inter-\nmediate crust experiments (Figure 6b), the sizes and positions\nof which reflected the distribution of crustal plates.\n3.4. Thick Crust Experiments, \u220f1 > 0.3 (\u220f1 = 0.38,\n0.44, 0.5)\n[30] The tensile flow front fractures were very widely\nspaced (Table 4) and had a horst and graben structure at\nhigher\u220f1 values. Fracture curvature again increased upflow.\nOpening of the arcuate rearmost fractures was not instanta-\nneous but began at the channel center and progressed sym-\nmetrically to the margins, so that the fractures narrowed\ntoward the margins (Figure 7). Isostatic upwelling of the core\nwas observed as the tensile fractures widened. No compres-\nsional ridges formed at the channel head, and the silicone\ninflux was not observed in front of the gate as soon after the\nstart of an experiment as for lower \u220f1 values. Doming of\nthe crust occurred close to the gate during the early part of\nthe experiments.\n[31] Although oblique fractures developed initially in the\nshear zones, these were longer and more widely spaced than\nin intermediate crusts (Figure 8). With time, the fractures\ngrew lower\u2010angle extensions then merged to form single,\nsinuous fractures down each margin that diverged slightly\ndownflow. Once the fractures merged, the velocity of the\ncentral part of the crust increased sharply.\n[32] As the silicone influx advanced down the channel,\nthe rearmost tensile fractures narrowed but could not close\nbecause of the upwelled silicone core. Compression and\ndeformation of the upwelled silicone produced complex flow\nsurface morphologies (Figure 9). Conjugate fracture spacing\nincreased with \u220f1, and only one orientation developed on\neither side of the flow centerline. The resultant arrowhead\u2010\nshaped crustal slab (Figure 9) advanced more rapidly than the\nfrontal and lateral portions of the flow, \u201cbulldozing\u201d outlying\ncrustal plates toward the margins where they were tilted\ntoward the flow front, causing flow thickening. The slab\nTable 4.

Tensile fracture spacing is the average of the maximum spacing (measured down the centerline of the channel) for\neach experiment. Tensile fracture zone length was measured down the channel centerline. As \u220f1 increased, fracture spacing, fracture zone length, and fold\nwavelength generally increased. The values for\u220f1 = 0.5 do not fit the trend, which may be due to lack of data: only 2 experiments were conducted with this\ncrustal thickness. Fold amplitude increased with wavelength, being of similar order.\nFigure 6. Ridge and fracture morphology in an intermediate\ncrust flow (experiment 16: \u220f1 = 0.29). Scale bars are 2 cm.\n(a) Where ridges developed in intermediate crusts, they had\nlonger wavelengths and were more irregularly shaped than\nin thin crusts. They commonly extended further down the\nmarginal shear zones than in the channel center. Short, syn-\nthetic shear fractures, oriented at \u223c15\u00b0 to the lev\u00e9es, were\nubiquitous in intermediate crusts. (b) Conjugate shear frac-\ntures developed under compression, creating crustal plates\nthat influenced the advance of the flow front, causing the\ndevelopment of small lobe structures.\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n7 of 15\neventually broke into smaller plates as progressive genera-\ntions of conjugate fractures developed.\n[33] Thick crust flow fronts were strongly lobate, with lobe\nsize and position again reflecting crustal plate distribution,\nhence, conjugate fracture spacing. Removing the crust after\nan experiment revealed layers of silicone interleaved with\nplates of crustal material (Figure 10). Comparing Figures 10\nand 4 shows a clear increase in the internal complexity\nwith \u220f1.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Experimental Flow Features\n[34] The different structures that developed within an\nexperimental flow reflected the spatially varying stress\u2010\nstrain distribution. Structural variation between experiments\nindicates the dependence of the stress\u2010strain distribution on\n\u220f1 and, to a lesser extent,\u220f3. Increasing\u220f1 increased crustal\nstrength, while increasing \u220f3 tended to increase the impor-\ntance of gravitational effects, at the expense of crustal\nstrength, in controlling morphology [Gregg and Fink, 2000].\nFigure 8. Shear zone fracture morphology in the early\nstages of a thick crust experiment (experiment 6: \u220f1 =\n0.44). Oblique shear fractures developed on both sides of\nthe channel but were longer and more widely spaced than\nin intermediate crusts (Figure 6a). These fractures were\ntransient, rapidly linking to form a single sinuous fracture\ndown each margin.\nFigure 7. Arcuate tensile fractures in a thick crust experiment\n(experiment 14:\u220f1 = 0.38). Fracture curvature has increased\nwith\u220f1, as can be seen by comparison with Figures 5 and 6.\nThe rearmost fracture is wider in the center of the channel,\nwhere it opened first. The fainter extensions (arrowed) indi-\ncate that the fracture was \u201cunzipping\u201d toward the margins.\nSome collapse of sand into the fractures was observed.\nFigure 9. Complex morphology in a thick crust flow front\n(experiment 20:\u220f1 = 0.5).Widely spaced conjugate fractures\n(\u201cc\u201c) are seen, though only one orientation grew on either side\nof the centerline of the channel. Arrows indicate the ridges of\nsilicone that welled up through the initial tensile fractures and\nwere then deformed by the action of the surrounding crustal\nplates.\nFigure 10. Core structures in thick crust flows. (a) Follow-\ning crust removal, the flow front was seen to consist of layers\nof silicone interleaved with pockets of sand, representing pro-\ngressive generations of upwelled silicone ridges that were\ndeformed to trap crust plates between them (experiment 20:\n\u220f1 = 0.5).

Gregg and Fink [1995] used slopes of 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0,\nfinding that the effects of slope were only detectable above\n10\u00b0.\n[35] Stress at the flow surface can be described using a\ncoordinate system in which x is the downflow, and y is the\ncross flow, direction. Figure 11a shows the initial stress\nregime, while Figures 11b, 11c, and 11d show the resultant\nstrains at different stages, as interpreted from the surface\nstructures. The longitudinal normal stress sx varied in mag-\nnitude along the channel and could be compressive, tensile, or\nzero. Under compression, sx = s1, the maximum principal\nstress. Under tension, sx = s3, the minimum principal stress.\nInitially, sxwas everywhere close to zero. The initial opening\nof fractures near the flow front indicates that sx rapidly\nbecame tensile (s3) near the flow surface in this region\n(Figures 11a and 11c). At the head of the channel, the silicone\ninflux caused sx to become compressive (s1) (Figure 11b).\nBetween these zones, sx remained low for longer, but as\nthe influx approached the flow front, compression was\nexperienced everywhere, and the entire crust was deformed\n(Figure 11d).\n[36] Surface velocity contour maps have been produced\nfrom the results of the surface marker tracking and can be\nFigure 11.

Closely spaced contours (steep velocity\ngradients) are indicative of regions of high strains and strain\nrates that are likely to be strongly deformed. Flow front\nextension is evidenced by velocities that decrease upflow,\nwhile compression at the channel head is reflected in veloc-\nities that decrease downflow. As \u220f1 increased, contours in\nthe compressional region became flattened, and this region\ndecreased in size; lateral velocity gradients steepened, and\nshear zones generally narrowed. Contour shape in the tensile\nregion remained largely unaffected. A surface \u201cplug\u201d was\nobserved for all \u220f1: a medial portion of the crust that expe-\nrienced low cross\u2010channel velocity gradients. The plug\nexperienced negligible strain, implying that sxwas below the\nyield strength of the crust in this region, and deformation was\nlocalized at its front and rear. Plug size increased with \u220f1,\nreflecting increasing crustal strength, and plug velocity also\nincreased (Figure 12d).\n[37] We now consider the development of each type of\nstructure (fractures, ridges, and lobes) individually, before\ndiscussing the overall crustal deformation and flow behavior.\n4.1.1. Fractures\n[38] Fractures developed in all but the no\/very thin crust\nexperiments, and their morphology varied systematically\nwith \u220f1. The spacing and curvature of tensile fractures and\nthe length of the fracture zone increased with increasing \u220f1\n(Table 4). The size of the fracture zone depended on the\nmagnitude of the tensile strain near the flow front. Because\nthe force acting to drive the flow downslope increased with\n\u220f1 (and also\u220f3), thicker flows (and those on steeper slopes)\nexperienced greater tensile stresses at the flow front, hence,\ngreater strains. Consequently, a longer section of the channel\nwas affected by fracturing.\n[39] The curvature of tensile fractures in the presence of\nwall shear stresses, which was also observed by Lescinsky\nand Merle [2005] and Schreurs et al. [2006], may reflect\nthe varying influence of the normal and shear stresses across\nthe channel (Figure 11a). The s3 direction rotates from flow\nparallel at the channel center to oblique near the margins, so\nfractures opened transverse to flow direction at the center but\ncurved downslope toward the margins. In thick crusts, the\ntensile fractures initiated at the channel center and \u201cunzipped\u201d\ntoward the margins (Figure 7). Initiation of crustal failure at\nthe channel center reflected the cross\u2010channel velocity pro-\nfile, which caused the maximum down\u2010channel stress, strain,\nand strain rate to be experienced here in the accelerating\nflows.\n[40] Similar modeling approaches designed to study\nextrusion tectonics and back arc spreading in subduction zone\nsettings have generated similar, though not identical, fracture\ndistributions [e.g., Hatzfeld et al., 1997; Gautier et al., 1999;\nSchellart and Lister, 2005]. In this work, brittle\u2010viscous\nmodels were allowed to spread through a constriction.\nAlthough transverse tensile fractures opened near the\nspreading front, deformation was dominated by conjugate\nsets of strike\u2010slip (transtensional) fractures [e.g., Figure 6,\nHatzfeld et al., 1997], which intersected at 45\u00b0\u201370\u00b0,\nmeasured transverse to spreading [Gautier et al., 1999].\nIncreasing the brittle layer thickness concentrated deforma-\ntion on a smaller number of normal fault\u2010bounded grabens\n[Schellart and Lister, 2005; Figure 6]. Although the sense of\nmovement on our arcuate fractures was transtensional near\nthe flow margins, conjugate fracturing was not the dominant\nmorphology in our tensile zones, possibly because of the\ndiffering experimental setup. While our flows spread from a\nconfining channel, the tectonic models spread through a\nconstriction, behind which material flowed laterally into the\ntensile zone, producing a different stress\u2010strain distribution.\n[41] During the later stages of our experiments, the advance\nof the silicone influx meant downflow compression was\nexperienced throughout the crust (Figure 11d). The resulting\nconjugate shear fractures intersected at \u223c60\u00b0, which corre-\nsponds to the Mohr\u2010Coulomb failure direction in a com-\npressive stress regime. This is \u00b1 (45\u00b0 \u2212 8\/2) to the direction\nof s1 (downflow), where 8, the angle of internal friction, is\n\u223c30\u00b0 for the sand and plaster mix. Gautier et al. [1999]\nmeasured similar intersection angles for their conjugate\ntranstensional fractures but transverse to spreading direction,\nindicating that in their experiments, s1 was oriented cross\u2010\nflow. During the early, tensile phase of our experiments, s1\nwas vertical near the front, with s2 cross\u2010flow in the plane\nof the flow surface (Figure 11a). This difference, which is\nattributable to the lateral flow of material in the tectonic\nmodels, accounts for the slightly different tensile fracture\npatterns observed.\n[42] Brittle deformation in the shear zones of intermediate\nand thick crust experiments was morphologically comparable\nto fault patterns observed during basement\u2010controlled wrench\nfaulting experiments [e.g., Riedel, 1929; Tchalenko, 1970;\nNaylor et al., 1986]. Synthetic fractures initially developed\nat \u223c15\u00b0 to the lev\u00e9es. If the shear zones are modeled as sim-\nple shear systems, with s1 oriented at \u223c45\u00b0 to the direction\nof imposed shear [Mandl et al., 1977], the fractures corre-\nspond to one of the two Mohr\u2010Coulomb failure directions\n(Figure 13). These are Riedel (R) shears, which were\nobserved by Naylor et al. [1986] to increase in length as\nthe brittle layer thickness increased, consistent with our\nobservations. Antithetic, anti\u2010Riedel (R\u2032) shears, which cor-\nrespond to the other failure direction, may develop, but are\nunfavorably oriented to accommodate large displacements,\nFigure 13. Possible fracture orientations in a zone of simple\nshear, corresponding the right\u2010hand margin of one of our\nexperimental channels. IS represents the direction of imposed\nshear. Initially, s1 is oriented at 45\u00b0 to IS [Mandl et al., 1977],\ncausing synthetic R shears to form, making angles of\n\u223c15\u00b0 with IS. Conjugate, antithetic, R\u2032 shears may also form,\nthough these cannot accommodate large strains and were not\nseen in our models. Following R shear formation, s1 may\nlocally rotate (as indicated), causing low\u2010angle shears to\ndevelop. R shears were seen in intermediate and thick crust\nexperiments (Figures 6a and 8). In thick crusts, these were\nlater linked by low\u2010angle shears to produce an initially sin-\nuous, through\u2010going strike\u2010slip fault. After the study of\nNaylor et al. [1986].\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n10 of 15\nso are short lived [Naylor et al., 1986]. They were not\nobserved in our models. With increasing \u220f1, the R shears in\nour experiments merged through the growth of low\u2010angle\nextensions, and fault lenses occasionally developed. This\nmay be explained by local modification of the original stress\nfield. Between the R shears, s1 rotates to become more\nclosely parallel to the direction of imposed shear, produc-\ning new, lower\u2010angle fractures [e.g., Naylor et al., 1986;\nSchellart and Nieuwland, 2003] (Figure 13). The low\u2010angle\nfaults, which are more favorable for accommodating dis-\nplacement, gradually replace R shears, and the merging of\ninitial faults produces a through\u2010going strike\u2010slip fault that\nmay incorporate fault lenses. The through\u2010going fractures in\nour thick crust experiments were initially sinuous, reflecting\ntheir origin as several individual fractures.\n4.1.2. Ridges\n[43] Compressional ridges developed in very thin, thin,\nand some intermediate crust experiments. A folding model\nhas been used successfully to describe surface ridges on\np\u0101hoehoe [Fink and Fletcher, 1978] and on dacitic and\nobsidian [Fink, 1980a] lava flows. Because there are other\nmechanisms by which surface structures resembling folds\ncan arise, ridge development must be examined before being\nattributed to folding.\n[44] Folding is inferred to result from the horizontal\nshortening of a medium in which a vertical velocity gradient\nexists [Fink and Fletcher, 1978]. We observed that although\nshortening and thickening occurred in experiments with no\ncrust, ridges only formed when crusts were present. Fink and\nFletcher [1978] suggested that shortening causes small sur-\nface perturbations that are selectively amplified according to\nwavelength and that mature folds are dominated by a single\nwavelength that increases with the thickness of the high\nviscosity boundary layer. We observed a similar trend in the\nexperiments, in which irregular ripple structures preceded the\ndevelopment of regular ridges. Our unpublished calculations\nsupport the theory that folding is an appropriate mechanism to\ninvoke for compressional ridge formation in our models.\n4.1.3. Lobe Formation and Internal Structure\n[45] The morphology of the flow front lobes that formed\nin intermediate and thick crust experiments depended on\nthe conjugate fracture spacing. Conjugate fracturing caused\nheterogeneous crustal distribution, resulting in uneven load-\ning of the core by crustal plates, and the uneven avalanching\nof material from the flow front. Crustal plates pushed regions\nof the flow front outwards, leaving embayments in the front\naligned with the fractures, which accounts for the relationship\nbetween fracture spacing and lobe size. The absence of lobes\nin very thin and thin crust experiments suggests that the\nweight of crust was insufficient to deform the core signifi-\ncantly. Material avalanching from the front slowed flow front\nadvance unevenly, contributing to lobe formation when in\nsufficient quantities.\n[46] The internal complexity of flow fronts increased\nmarkedly with \u220f1 (compare Figures 4 and 10). Late\u2010stage\ncompression rolled the silicone upwelled through the tensile\nfractures forward, entraining pockets of crustal material and\nresulting in a layered structure (Figure 10). Early examples of\nthis process were preserved at the flow base as small, sand\u2010\nfilled cracks. The comparatively simple structure of experi-\nments with\u220f1 < 0.3 is explained by the absence of upwelling.\n4.1.4. Localization of Deformation: Brittle Versus\nDuctile Structures\n[47] As \u220f1 increased, the change in structures reflected a\ntransition in crustal response from ductile deformation (folds\nonly) through brittle\u2010ductile (folds and fractures) to purely\nbrittle failure (fractures only). In most cases, increasing \u220f3\nalso hastened the onset of brittle deformation. Increasing\neither \u220f1 or \u220f3 increased channel velocities (the former\nbecause of increased overall flow thickness), producing\nsteeper\u2010cross\u2010channel velocity gradients, higher wall shear\nstresses, and higher strain rates.\n[48] Flow behavior can be characterized by the dimen-\nsionless parameter\u220f5, which illustrates the relative influence\nof the brittle and ductile layers in terms of gravitational and\nviscous forces. Schueller and Davy [2008] defined a similar\nparameter G a \u201cbrittle\u2010to\u2010ductile strength ratio,\u201d to describe\nthe behavior of simulated brittle\u2010ductile lithospheric defor-\nmation under shortening.\n[49] Plotting\u220f5 sin\u220f3 against\u220f1 shows that the influence\nof the brittle crust on the overall flow behavior increased as\ncrustal thickness increased (Figure 14), as a result of greater\ncrustal strength. The increasing strength with\u220f1 also affected\nthe fracture distribution. At low \u220f1 (hence low \u220f5 sin \u220f3),\nthe crust was pervasively deformed by many fractures with\nsmall offsets, but as\u220f1 increased, deformation was localized\non a smaller number of larger faults. The localization of\ndeformation with increasing brittle crustal thickness, which\nwas also observed in the tectonic models, can be explained\nin terms of the distribution of strain over the fractures that\ndeveloped. As \u220f1 increased, the number of fractures that\nopened decreased, while the total strain experienced, save\ninitially near the flow front, probably remained largely\nunchanged. The proportion of total strain accommodated by\nFigure 14. The relationship between\u220f1, the ratio of crustal\nto total flow thickness and \u220f5 sin \u220f3, an expression for the\nrelative influence of the brittle crust and the viscous flow\ncore. Increasing \u220f1 caused a rapid increase in \u220f5 sin \u220f3,\ndemonstrating the increasing influence of the brittle crust\non flow behavior. The results are divided into those which\nshowed only ductile, those that showed both ductile and brit-\ntle, and those that showed only brittle deformation. The struc-\ntures that developed depended strongly on\u220f1 but alsoweakly\non slope\u220f3, which hastened the onset of brittle deformation.\nThe open circles indicate the results of the analysis of the Big\nGlass Mountain (BGM) rhyolitic obsidian, which falls in the\nbrittle\u2010ductile regime.\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n11 of 15\neach fracture therefore increased, resulting in wider fractures.\nAlthough no fractures were observed in the very thin crust,\nthey may have developed but remained undetected, as they\nwere sufficiently narrow to be rapidly infilled by shifting sand\ngrains. Deformation, which appeared to be ductile, may not\nhave been on a scale smaller than that usually observable.\n[50] In the shear zones, strain was accommodated by R\nshears. In intermediate crusts, these survived throughout\nthe experiment, as they were sufficiently numerous that each\nonly experienced a small strain. In thick crusts, however, the\ndevelopment of low\u2010angle shears was necessary to accom-\nmodate the greater strain experienced by the individual\nfractures. This facilitated the development of the through\u2010\ngoing strike slip faults.\n4.2. Natural Flow Morphologies\n[51] All of the surface structures produced in the experi-\nments have been observed on lavas and glaciers in the field.\nExamples are presented below, but the comparisons are\nlargely qualitative because robust measurements of the\nphysical properties of lavas are scarce. Measuring lava flow\ndepths during activity and crustal depths either during or after\nactivity is also difficult. We hope that future field work\nmay provide data that will test our results further but suggest\nthat the qualitative similarity demonstrated below indicates\nthat the experiments are representative of natural flow\nprocesses.\n4.2.1. Lavas\n[52] On Etna, arcuate fractures are common on lava flows\nfrom ephemeral boccas [Kilburn, 1990] and have also been\nobserved on large channelized \u2019a\u2019\u0101 flows. Figure 15a shows\nan example in which arcuate fractures developed at the sur-\nface of a flow as it approached a break in slope, so experi-\nenced tensile stresses. These fractures have outwardly convex\nwalls, reminiscent of crease structures observed on lava flows\nand domes, which are fractures through which the hot core\nwells up, then cools and solidifies [Anderson and Fink, 1992].\nAlthough upwelling occurred in our experiments, true crease\nstructures could not develop because the core could not\nsolidify [Lescinsky and Merle, 2005].\n[53] Figure 15b shows an example of suspected conjugate\nshear fractures on an \u2019a\u2019\u0101 flow unit. This flow is geometrically\nsimilar to the experimental flows, spreading laterally beyond\nconfining lev\u00e9es. The dark, linear surface features are\n\u201csqueeze\u2010ups\u201d of the flow core through the crust [Applegarth\net al., 2010]. Although the oblique view prevents estimation\nof their relative orientations, they appear to be aligned in two\ndominant directions. In the absence of squeeze\u2010ups, the\nfractures may have remained unobserved because of the\ncollapse of clinker into them. This may also be the reason that\nmarginal shear fractures have not been conclusively docu-\nmented on lavas.\n[54] Flow front lobes are observed on lavas of all compo-\nsitions (e.g., Figure 15b), but their development in clinker\u2010\ncovered lavas is less well understood than in p\u0101hoehoe flows.\nIt is unlikely that higher\u2010silica flows develop lobes through\nsequential, p\u0101hoehoe\u2010like crustal failure, as they rarely (if\never) develop breakouts or tubes. Our experiments provide a\nlobe formation mechanism that does not require the visco-\nelastic layer reported in p\u0101hoehoe [Hon et al., 1994], sup-\nporting the suggestion of Kilburn [1993] that brittle crusts\nmay actively alter flow behavior rather than resting passively\non the ductile flow core. The formation of lobes through the\ndevelopment of conjugate fractures, hence crustal plates, is\ninvoked in the flow front development of one of the 2001\nEtna lava flow fields [Applegarth et al., 2010].\n[55] Folding is observed in lavas of all compositions. Using\ndata from the study of Fink [1980a, 1980b], we estimate \u220f1\nand \u220f5 sin \u220f3 values for the north lobe of the Big Glass\nMountain rhyolitic obsidian lava flow. The flow front depth is\n75m, and the crust depth (estimated from themaximum depth\nof open fractures on the flow) is 10 m. Assuming the front is\nthe thickest part of the flow, this gives a lower limit for\u220f1 of\n0.13. Fink [1980a] states that rheological data have not been\ncollected directly from flowing rhyolite, so estimates core\nviscosity from temperature measurements of a rhyodacitic\neruption at Trident volcano (Alaska) (900\u00b0C) [Friedman\net al., 1963] and the measured water content of the Big\nGlass Mountain flow (0.10%) [Shepherd, 1938]. This gives a\nvalue of 108 Pa s. The lava density is 2000 kgm\u22123. Depending\non the time period over which the folds grew (estimated at 1 h\nto 1 week), strain rates were 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 8.3 \u00d7 10\u22127, which,\nover a distance of 500 m, gives shortening velocities of 0.07\nto 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 m s\u22121. The flow was emplaced on a slope of 8\u00b0,\nso \u220f5 sin \u220f3 falls in the range 0.04\u20137, suggesting that this\nFigure 15.

As the flow approached a\nbreak in slope, the fractures developed in response to the ten-\nsile stresses experienced. The approximate cross\u2010sectional\nstructure of one of these fractures (A\u2010A\u2032) shows outwardly\nconvex walls. (b) A small overflow front, which shows sim-\nilar geometry to that of the experimental flows, spreading lat-\nerally beyond a channel. The flow front is lobate. The darker,\napproximately linear features are squeeze\u2010ups, the distribu-\ntion of which may have been controlled by conjugate shear\nfracture development in the crust (Image: Istituto Nazionale\ndi Geofisica e Vulcanologia Catania).\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n12 of 15\nflow falls in the brittle\u2010ductile regime, which is consistent\nwith the presence of both folds and fractures (Figure 14).\n4.2.2. Application to Glaciers\n[56] Although the experiments were designed to simulate\nthermally stratified lava flows, they may be relevant to the\nstudy of other flows with a rheological stratification. The\npower law viscous rheology of glaciers (which may also have\nyield strengths) can produce depth\u2010dependent behavior that\nmimics rheological stratification because of stress\u2010strain\nvariations with depth. At depth (large stresses, low strain\nrates), ice deforms by ductile creep and fractures do not open.\nNear the surface, high strain rates promote crevasse opening\nby brittle fracture [Hambrey, 1976; Hambrey and Lawson,\n2000].\n[57] The behavior of valley glaciers was modeled by Nye\n[1952], who predicted the formation of arcuate crevasses\nunder tensile stress and en echelon marginal crevasses under\ncompressive stress. Many authors have observed such brittle\ndeformation structures in the field, as well as ductile defor-\nmation structures including folds and crevasse traces [e.g.,\nHambrey and M\u00fcller, 1978; Herbst et al., 2006].\n5. Implications\n[58] Our simulations illustrate how the presence of a brittle\ncrust may affect the advance and overall flow dynamics of a\nrheologically stratified flow. No surface structures developed\nin the absence of a crust, while the introduction of a thin\ncrust resulted in surface folding under compression. As \u220f1\nincreased, the disappearance of folds and the change from\nsmoothly curved to flattened, plug\u2010like cross\u2010channel velocity\ncontours in the upper channel indicated the increasing\nstrength of the crust in compression and shear, although\nthe unchanging contour shape at the flow front suggests\nthat crustal tensile strength is independent of thickness\n(Figure 12). The formation of lobes in intermediate and thick\ncrusts indicated the increasing role played by the crust in\nmodifying the flow advance as \u220f1 increased.\n[59] Behavior at the crust\u2010core interface is inferred to vary\nwith\u220f1. At low\u220f1, crustal folding at the head of the channel\nwas observed very soon after the start of an experiment. With\nincreasing \u220f1, folding at the channel head was replaced by\ncrustal doming, and the initial resistance to crust advance\nincreased because of greater wall shear stresses. This leads us\nto infer some shear between the crust and core during the\nearly stages of thick crust models, which may have led to a\nreverse sense of shear in the upper part of the silicone layer\n[Merle, 1998]. After the development of the through\u2010going\nshear zone faults, the decoupling of the crustal plug from the\nlev\u00e9es would have eliminated any reverse shear.\n[60] Different values of \u220f1 represent flows at different\nstages of emplacement. The thinnest crusts represent proxi-\nmal flows that have not cooled significantly. Little or no shear\nis inferred between crust and core. The plug flow regime that\ndeveloped with increasing \u220f1 (Figure 12) corresponds to\nmore distal flows and may be comparable to the \u201cmobile\u201d\ncrust regime described in PEG models by Griffiths et al.\n[2003]. Although self\u2010supporting roofs (the \u201ctube\u201c regime\nof Griffiths et al. [2003]) did not form in our experi-\nments because of insufficient crustal cohesion, the increas-\ning initial resistance to crustal advance with\u220f1 suggests that\nthe initial stages of thick crust experiments simulate condi-\ntions that are close to tube flow.\n[61] Our observations indicate that as \u220f1 increased, the\ndegree of crust\u2010core interaction increased, and the crust\nplayed an increasingly significant role in controlling flow\nbehavior. The core initially governed advance in all flows,\nshown by the curved cross\u2010channel velocity contours\n(Figure 12), but the permanent disruption of thick crust fronts\ndue to upwelling, entrainment, and avalanching affected\nsubsequent advance. Although increased crust thickness\nshould improve insulation, thus, reduce cooling, in lavas, our\nresults suggest that a positive feedback mechanism may\noperate following thick crust fracturing. The exposure of the\nflow core during tensile fracturing increased with \u220f1, as\nfractures were wider and more upwelling occurred. In addi-\ntion, more crustal material was entrained in thick crust\nmodels, which in active lavas could lead to an increased rate\nof cooling by advection, thus, reinforcing the tendency of the\nfront to cease advancing. This process could be important in\nthe cessation of cooling\u2010limited lava flows.\n[62] Dimensional analysis indicates that our experiments\ncan represent lavas of a wide range of compositions, from\nbasaltic \u2019a\u2019\u0101 to rhyolite, so the results may assist in the\ninterpretation of flow dynamics from surface structures on\nmost lavas. One significant outcome concerns the advance\nmechanism of clinker\u2010covered lava flow fronts beyond the\nchannelized region, in the zone of dispersed flow [Lipman\nand Banks, 1987]. While lobe formation in p\u0101hoehoe lavas\nhas been attributed to the influence of a viscoelastic layer\n[Hon et al., 1994], it is less well understood in higher\u2010silica\nflows. Because the tensile strength of a brittle crust is negli-\ngible in comparison with that of a viscoelastic layer, the role\nof the brittle layer in influencing flow behavior has often been\noverlooked [e.g., Iverson, 1990]. However, the development\nof lobes in our experiments due to fracture\u2010related hetero-\ngeneous crustal distribution and avalanching indicates that\nthe influence of a brittle crust on flow advance may be as\nsignificant as that of a viscoelastic layer.\n[63] Despite rheological simplification, the experiments\nproduced surface morphologies that are similar to those\nobserved on flow of lava and ice, suggesting that a two\u2010layer\nviscous\u2010brittle rheology is capable of simulating either rhe-\nologically stratified (lava) or power law viscous (ice) rheol-\nogies. Gautier et al. [1999], who noted that their fracture\npatterns were similar to the slip lines produced by plane strain\ndeformation of rigid plastics, suggest that brittle\u2010viscous\nmodels may also simulate plastic behavior, despite none of\nthe materials demonstrating plastic behavior.\n6. Summary\n[64] Our experimental results indicate that a brittle crust can\nbe a significant control on the structures produced at the\nsurface of a viscous\u2010brittle flow, and on the flow advance\nmechanism, depending on its thickness. Slope was found to\nmodify flow behavior only slightly. Increasing the ratio of\ncrustal to total flow thickness (\u220f1) increases the influence\nof crustal strength with respect to viscous resistance (char-\nacterized by \u220f5). This is reflected in the development of\napparently ductile structures at low \u220f1 (core control) and\nbrittle structures at high \u220f1 (crustal control). The most sig-\nAPPLEGARTH ET AL.: EFFECT OF BRITTLE CRUSTS ON LAVA FLOWS B07210B07210\n13 of 15\nnificant outcomes of our experimental work are outlined\nbelow.\n[65] 1. Increasing \u220f1 increased the localization of defor-\nmation, which at the flow front resulted in more exposure of\nthe flow core. More crust\u2010core interaction was observed at\nhigh \u220f1. In lavas, these processes may result in increased\ncooling through radiative heat loss and the entrainment of\ncrustal material into the hot core.\n[66] 2.

The experiments successfully reproduced surface\nstructures observed on lavas and glaciers, providing insight\ninto their formation. Similar features identified on flows of\nthese rheologies in the field may be used as indicators of\nthe flow dynamics at the time of their formation.\n[68] Acknowledgments.
