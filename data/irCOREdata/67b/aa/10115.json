In the initial interview \nand in history taking, psychotherapists use a multitude \nof (meta)-psychological categories to describe mental \nfunctions and their disorders. Many of these metapsy-\nchological theories were formulated in such an abstract \nway that they are more or less detached from clinical phe-\nnomena and cannot be applied. This development doubt-\nlessly leads to theory heterogeneity and to confusion of \nconcepts in psychoanalysis. \n There is already experience of psychotherapy research-\ners in the operationalization of relevant psychoanalytic \nconstructs. Bellak and Hurvich  [1] already attempted to \noperationalize ego function and developed rating scales \nto enable judgment of the ego function as observed in \nclinical interviews. A series of research instruments as-\nsume that behavior patterns are not only represented \nwith others but above all in the therapeutic relationship \nand thus the empirical assessment of transference rela-\ntionships is possible  [2\u20134] . In psychotherapy research, \noperationalization of conflict  [5, 6] and of defense mech-\nanisms  [7] has also been attempted. \n Weinryb and R\u00f6ssel developed a more comprehensive \napproach to achieve a psychodynamic profile based on op-\nerationalized psychoanalytic constructs  [8] . The 18 sub-\nscales of the Karolinska Psychodynamic Profile were for-\nmulated with the goal of comprehensively assessing men-\ntal function and personality traits as they are reflected in \na patient\u2019s perception of himself and his relationships with \nothers. The subscales are formulated on different levels of \nabstraction, and the interpretation required for each sub-\nscale also varies. It is clear that psychodynamic operation-\nalization cannot remain at the behavioral level, but inter-\npretation contributes to the judgment, since mental\/intra-\npsychic conflict cannot be directly observed. \n The Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics \nSystem \n The Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics \n(OPD) system is intended as an empirical and theory-in-\ndependent instrument which promotes communication \nwithin psychoanalysis and with related disciplines. An \nimportant aspect, therefore, was the agreement in the \nOPD group regarding the extent to which indirect conclu-\nsion, for example unconscious components, are permitted \nin the clinical evaluation of behavior patterns. A working \ngroup: Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis, con-\nsisting of psychoanalysts, specialists in psychosomatic \nmedicine, and psychiatrists, was founded in 1990 in Ger-\nmany. The goal was to broaden the ICD-10 classification, \nwhich is oriented to symptoms and descriptions, to in-\nclude fundamental psychodynamic dimensions. This \nworking party developed a diagnostic inventory as well as \na handbook  [9] for experienced therapists for training and \nclinical purposes. The OPD system is based on 4 psycho-\ndynamically relevant diagnostic axes with appropriate \ncategories to complement ICD classification: \n Axis I: Experience of illness and prerequisites for treat-\nment \n Axis II: Interpersonal relations \n Axis III: Conflicts \n Axis IV: Structure \n Axis V: Syndromal, according to chapter V (F) of \nICD-10 \n During an initial 1- to 2-hour patient examination, the \nclinician (or external observer) evaluates the patient\u2019s \npsychodynamics and fills this in on the OPD evaluation \nsheet. There are interview guidelines to ensure the rele-\nvant information is obtained. These are flexible enough \nfor the interview to be conducted as an open psychody-\nnamic interview. \n Brief Discussion of the Axes \n Axis I: Experience of Illness and Prerequisites for \nTreatment \n Items relating to this axis concern the patient\u2019s moti-\nvation and the indications for psychodynamic psycho-\ntherapy. Items are judged on a scale \u2013 absent (0), low (1), \nmedium (2), high (3). There is also a category unassess-\nable. The individual diagnostic dimensions are filled into \na glossary. Anchor examples are used with the intention \nto improve diagnostic reliability. \n 1 Severity of somatic illness \n 2 Severity of mental illness \n 3 Patient\u2019s subjective suffering \n 4 Impairment of self-experience \n 5 Secondary benefit illness \n 6 Extent of physical impairment\/disability \n 7 Comprehending and accepting psychodynamic and \npsychosomatic associations \n 8 Comprehending and accepting psychodynamic so-\nmatopsychic associations \n 9 Evaluation of appropriate treatment (psychotherapy) \n 10 Evaluation of appropriate treatment (medical treat-\nment) \n 11 Motivation for psychotherapy \n Operationalized Psychodynamic \nDiagnostics System \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 211\n 12 Motivation for physical treatment \n 13 Compliance \n 14 Presentation of symptoms \n 15 \u2013 somatic symptoms to the fore \n 16 \u2013 mental symptoms to the fore \n 17 Psychosocial integration \n 18 Personal resources \n 19 Social support \n 20 Appropriateness of subjective impairment related to \nthe severity of the illness. \n This axis illustrates the experience that illness course \nis not only determined by syndrome and symptoms but \nby the subjective and social context of the affected per-\nson. Social support and personal understanding of the \nillness have a great influence on the course, especially \nwith regard to the psychotherapeutic treatment options. \n Axis II: Interpersonal Relations \n Mental disorders are \u2018relationship disorders\u2019, thus tra-\nditional interpersonal behavior is central for the genesis \nand maintenance of mental disorders. Representation of \ndysfunctional or maladaptive behavior has therefore be-\ncome the focus of psychodynamic and psychotherapeutic \nresearch in recent years  [3, 4, 10] . Lifelong \u2018accumulation\u2019 \nof relationship experience in the form of cognitive affec-\ntive schemata  [11, 12] is therefore the foundation for what \nin psychoanalysis is conceptualized as transference and \ncountertransference. \n The basic structure of the OPD relationship axis de-\npicts the circular or the transactional character of human \ninteraction (interchange of subjective experience and re-\nsponse to the environment). A framework was developed \nwhich encapsulates subjective experience concerning self \nand others on the initial level. On a second level, it is pos-\nsible to represent the experience of this other person (sig-\nnificant other, interviewer): how is the patient experi-\nenced by his objects or the interviewer and which im-\npulses does he generate in them? The construction of the \nOPD instrument is achieved from the following two per-\nspectives: how does the patient experience himself in re-\nlationships? The interviewer judges behavior patterns as \nexperienced by the patient vis-\u00e0-vis others. How does the \npatient experience the behavior of others? \n The therapist also evaluates transference and counter-\ntransference from these two perspectives: how does the \ntherapist experience the initiation of the relationship \nthrough the patient? How does the therapist experience \nhimself in the relationship to the patient? \n Items of the OPD relationship axis help to define the \nvariety of behaviors seen in relationships. \n The categories come from the tradition of the inter-\npersonal circle model, and depict relationships regarding \naffection and control  [10, 13\u201315] . \n Diagnostic integration of various experience perspec-\ntives enables the description of habitual behavior pat-\nterns, although emphasis is on dysfunctional patterns, as \nis commonly the focus in psychotherapies. \n Axis III: Conflicts \n OPD distinguishes seven mental conflicts and has a \ncategory for limited conflict perception: \n 1 Dependence vs. autonomy \n 2 Submission vs. control \n 3 Desire for care vs. autarchy \n 4 Conflicts of self-value \n 5 Guilt conflicts \n 6 Oedipal sexual conflicts \n 7 Identity conflicts \n 8 Limited perception of conflicts and feelings \n These seven basic conflicts and the last category (e.g. \nwith somatizing patients) are judged on the basis of ideal-\ntype descriptions according to presence (dimensional \nevaluation from \u2018not present\u2019 to \u2018present and not signifi-\ncant\u2019 to \u2018present and significant\u2019 to \u2018present and very sig-\nnificant\u2019). Furthermore, for each patient the two main \nareas of conflict (category value) is given. Description of \nthe basic conflicts and their method of processing occurs \nin the OPD system in connection with central life areas \nsuch as relationship to partner, family of origin, profes-\nsion, ownership, behavior in groups and illness experi-\nence. Not only lasting conflicts but also other major con-\nflict can arise in response to acute life-changing stressors. \nIf such stressors cause the conflict, there is an appropriate \ncategory and long-lasting conflicts should not be rated. \n Conflict can be judged in history-taking on the basis \nof perceived behavior and experience ways (scene, trans-\nference, countertransference) and manifest themselves \non subject and object level (inner mental) and in interac-\ntion with others. Conflicts are often connected to prom-\ninent affect (e.g. anger in narcissistic disorders). There is \na glossary for the conflicts in various forms (active or \npassive) in different life areas as well as a checklist. \n The OPD conflict definitions are illustrated on the ba-\nsis of the passive modality of desire for care vs. autarchy: \n In the passive mode, the patient is strongly bound to \nother people and expresses wishes concerning security \nand care. Separation and rejection are responded to with \ndepressive mood and\/or fear. The patient is very depen-\ndent and needy. In the countertransference, the therapist \nexperiences worry, blackmail and helplessness. Intimate \n Cierpka\/Grande\/Rudolf\/von der Tann\/\nStasch \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 212\nrelationships are organized that separation appears im-\npossible (e.g. financial linkage) and can be characterized \nby claustrophobic closeness. Grasping tendencies are re-\nactively defended by frequently changing relationships. \nNeed to be looked after means that the patient remains \nlong and excessively loyally in the family of origin. In \nprofessional life, the patient seeks accomplices and help-\ners, professional demands are understood as withdrawal \nof support and responded to with depression. In social \nsituations, the patient seeks caring relationships, and is \nregarded as demanding and tiring by others due to his \nwishes and demands. In times of illness, the patient shows \na passive, grasping expectant approach to the doctor and \nis difficult to rehabilitate. \n Axis IV: Structure \n OPD differentiates four levels of structure (well inte-\ngrated, moderately integrated, low, disintegrated). Good \nintegration means that an autonomous self possesses a \nmental internal space in which mental conflicts can be \ncarried out. Moderate integration implies lower availabil-\nity of regulating function and a weaker differentiation of \nmental substructures. With low integration, the mental \ninner space and substructures are less developed, thus \nconflicts are barely mentally worked out, but are mainly \nworked out in the interpersonal sphere. Disintegration is \ncharacterized by fragmentation and psychotic restitution \nof structure. \n Operationalization of structure is based on 6 struc-\ntural categories: \n 1 Self-perception \n 2 Self-regulation \n 3 Defense \n 4 Object perception \n 5 Communication \n 6 Bonding \n For each structural category, the manual allows deter-\nmination of the level of integration. Finally the structur-\nal profile as well as the total structural level can be deter-\nmined. Additionally there is a checklist for each item and \nevery subcategory for the rating  [16] . \n Relations between the Axes \n In a study on 81 patients  [17] the relations between \naxes II\u2013IV were investigated. The following correlations \nbetween the overall score of the level of structure and a \ngiven conflict could be shown: oedipal conflict, r = 0.45 \n(p  ! 0.01); submission vs. control, r = 0.37 (p  ! 0.01); de-\nsire for care vs. autarchy, r = 0.24 (p  ! 0.05); guilt conflict, \nr = 0.19 (n.s.); self- vs. object value, r = \u20130.23 (p  ! 0.05); \ndependence vs. autonomy, r = \u20130.61 (p  ! 0.01). This \nmeans that the dependence vs. autonomy conflict is very \nfrequently associated with a lower level of structure. With \nregard to the correlations between the axes relationship \nand structure, two groups with low and high levels of \nstructure were tested according to the clustering of the \nrelationship items within different octants of the inter-\npersonal circumplex model. The results show significant \ncorrelations between the lower level of integration and \nmodes of devaluation and isolation, whereas in the high-\ner-level group modes of protection and clinging were \nfound significantly more frequent. The relations between \nthe axes conflict and relation are complex and specific for \neach conflict. \n Status or Process Diagnosis: Focus Possibilities \n OPD diagnostics can be used as status diagnostics in \npersonality or psychotherapy research. The individual \nOPD axes are judged concerning the dysfunctional pat-\ntern of the relationship (axis I), the life-determining con-\nflicts (axis II), and the integration of the personality \nstructure (axis IV). These psychodynamic dimensions \ncomplete the ICD-10 syndromal description (axis V). \nAxis I is especially suitable for patient populations con-\ncerning their subjective experience and their suitability \nfor psychotherapy. Status diagnostics on the individual \nOPD axes or with the full OPD system are especially use-\nful where a standardized psychodynamic point of view \nfrom individual patients or samples and, for example, \nwith personality diagnostics should be coupled with oth-\ner approaches. \n Apart from research-oriented status diagnostics, the \nmost important goal of the OPD system is in the clinical \ntherapeutic area. The OPD findings can supply the clini-\ncian with information to aid in deciding on differential \ntherapy indication and treatment planning  [18] . Axis I \ncan help clarify the patient\u2019s basic assumptions regarding \neventual psychotherapy. Judgments of structure level \n(axis IV) are decisive for the choice of suitable psycho-\ntherapy methods above all regarding the alternative be-\ntween more supportive structural or meaning-uncover-\ning processes, as well as in particular circumstances for \ndeciding between in- or outpatient psychotherapy. OPD \nfindings can also indicate the topics to be worked on in \npsychotherapy: dysfunctional relationship patterns (axis \nII) in the sense of pathogenic beliefs require special ther-\n Operationalized Psychodynamic \nDiagnostics System \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 213\napeutic attention and interventions so that therapy does \nnot fail due to complications in the therapeutic relation-\nship. By stressing the most prominent conflicts (axis III) \nand\/or the most prominent structural deficiencies which \nilluminate vulnerability and available resources to be \ntaken into account, therapy goals can be identified and \ntherapeutic planning can be derived on the basis of the \nassessment. \n The psychotherapeutic consequences of OPD diag-\nnostics are especially concrete in the logic of focus formu-\nlation and the formulation of therapy goals related to this. \nIn clinical research projects such as the Practice Study of \nAnalytic Longtime Therapy  [19\u201322] , this process was \nused and evaluated in an outpatient setting. Determina-\ntion of a dynamic relationship focus in the therapist group \nalso allows team-centered behavior vis-\u00e0-vis the patient \non the ward  [23, 24] . \n On the basis of individual OPD diagnostics, therapeu-\ntic foci can be named. The causative characteristics which \nmaintain the disorder and therefore play a decisive role in \nthe psychodynamics of the clinical picture are the foci of \ntherapy. It seems that 5 foci are enough  [19, 20, 22, 25] to \ncapture the different aspects of a disorder; it appears ad-\nvantageous to choose one relationship focus and at least \none conflict (the most prominent conflict assessed in axis \nIII) and one structure focus (the most prominent struc-\ntural deficiency assessed in axis IV). In the research proj-\nects, independent observers interviewed the patients at \nregular intervals to assess their  development concerning \nthe foci; in the practice projects, the therapists chose both \nfoci and arranged treatment. In contrast to traditional \npsychoanalysis, which retrospectively describes often un-\ndesired developments of the patient (and emphasizes that \nthese should be allowed to happen without therapeutic \nintervention), the OPD group employs the logic that the \ntherapist and the patient determine together at the begin-\nning of treatment the important psychodynamic foci for \nthe particular problem and choose the suitable therapeu-\ntic approaches to restructure these foci. \n The Heidelberg Structural Change Scale  [26] was de-\nveloped to differentiate therapeutic change in OPD find-\nings above and beyond the simple dichotomy of present\/\nnot present. This scale is related to the Assimilation of \nProblematic Experiences Scales  [27] and allows through \nits fine gradations a quantitative weighting of therapeutic \nchange in each individual focus  [28, 29] . Furthermore, a \nstructure  [16] and a conflict checklist  [30] were devel-\noped which simplify the judgment of these two dimen-\nsions for the clinician. Use of these instruments especial-\nly allows a differentiated description of the therapeutic \nprocess and success from a specific psychoanalytic point \nof view  [31] . \n This logic is especially developed for the determina-\ntion of the focus and therapy in axis IV, but there are also \nconcrete recommendations for therapeutic work  [31, 32] , \nthus in a broader sense it is a therapy manual. Some re-\nsearch has already been done on the clinical implementa-\ntion of an OPD axis II-based treatment approach in inpa-\ntient psychotherapy  [33\u201335] . One study  [33] aimed to ex-\nplore the effects of a systematic focus conference and \nrelationship-focused intervention in comparison to the \n\u2018treatment as usual\u2019. The modified relationship-focused \ntreatment produces better improvements not in the symp-\ntomatic, but in the interpersonally oriented outcome \nmeasures (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, IIP; \nGARF). Moreover, significant changes were achieved in \nshorter treatment duration. \n Reliability Measures (Axis I\u2013IV) \n In developing OPD, we tried to operationalize central \nconcepts of psychodynamic diagnostics using empirical \nand simple criteria to enable objective and reliable judg-\nment of patients, but not at the expense of essential con-\ntent. The outcome was a diagnostic system which requires \ncomplex clinical judgments but which can be learned \nthrough intensive training. As experience shows, apart \nfrom training the quality of the data assessed as well as \nthe clinical training and professional experience play an \nimportant role in the quality of the evaluations. \n In a study  [36] with 269 patients from 6 psychosomatic \nclinics, the reliability of OPD axes I\u2013IV was investigated. \nSince rater conditions were different from clinic to clinic, \nit was also possible to determine which conditions im-\nprove or do not improve reliability. The measure used was \nweighted kappa  [37] . For axes I, III and IV in the fixing of \nthe weighting, equal distance was assumed between each \nof the 4 stages of the rating scales; in this way, a kappa \nvalue was obtained which can be similarly interpreted to \na Pearson correlation coefficient  [38] . A weighted kappa \nwas also reckoned for axis II. In this case, this procedure \ncorresponds to that described in the Structural Analysis \nof Social Behavior (SASB)  [10] . The standard deviation \nweights are according to a procedure of circumplex mod-\nels as described by Grawe-Gerber and Benjamin  [39] . \n Interviews that were conducted for diagnostic purpos-\nes and video-recorded were independently rated and \nshowed good reliability values. For axis II, these condi-\ntions were obtained for 2 of 6 clinics; kappa values were \n Cierpka\/Grande\/Rudolf\/von der Tann\/\nStasch \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 214\nfrom 0.62 to 0.56  [40] . The reliability of axis III was ex-\namined in a single clinic under these conditions. A mean \nvalue of 0.61 was achieved for all 9 conflicts of this axis; \nthe range was 0.48\u20130.71. The reliability values for axis IV \nwas the best. In 2 clinics for all 6 structure dimensions \nmean reliability, values of 0.71 (range 0.62\u20130.78) and 0.70 \n(range 0.60\u20130.81), respectively, were achieved. To date \nthere have been no investigations of axis I based on re-\ncorded diagnostic interviews. \n According to Fleiss  [41] and Chicchetti  [42] , kappa \nvalues between 0.40 and 0.59 can be judged as fair and \nvalues between 0.60 and 0.74 as good. Higher values are \ndeemed excellent. This corresponds approximately to the \nevaluations of Landis and Koch  [43] , although the latter \nset the value for excellent somewhat higher at 0.80. Thus, \nthe reliability values for axis II and axis III are fair or \ngood, for axis IV good or excellent. \n In 2 of the 6 clinics, the interviews were conducted un-\nder the conditions of clinical routine. This means the in-\nterviews were conducted rather pragmatically with lim-\nited time resources. Ratings were performed by the inter-\nviewer and a second rater who was present in the interview. \nIn these 2 clinics, mean reliability values for all 4 axes be-\ntween 0.30 and 0.50 were obtained. These values corre-\nspond approximately to the results of an earlier OPD prac-\nticability study by Michels et al.  [44] , which was also con-\nducted under the conditions of clinical routine. \n In another clinic, the ratings took place likewise on the \nbasis of videotaped interviews; however, the raters were \nclinically inexperienced students. Here the mean values \nfor axis II were 0.42, for the conflict axis 0.33 and for the \nstructure axis 0.55. Since these students had undergone \nthe standard training, it can be assumed that clinical in-\nexperience is disadvantageous for the OPD rating. Ac-\ncording to these studies at least 2\u20133 years clinical experi-\nence are necessary for an adequately reliable use of \nOPD. \n In summary, the reliability for axis II and axis III are \nsatisfactory and for axis IV good, when the judgment is \nbased on interviews conducted under research condi-\ntions. Concerning the reliability in clinical routine, it \nshould be noted that ICD-10 is also only moderately reli-\nable in clinical day-to-day use  [44] . \n Table 1.

The \u2018Fragebogen zur Psycho-\ntherapiemotivation\u2019  [45] shows at least in part a content \nthat is highly related to items or characteristics of axis I. \nThere are good indications for the clinical validity of axis \nI from the results of different clinical disorders, treatment \nsettings and age groups  [46] . Axis I discriminates these \ngroups according to the previously formulated expecta-\ntions. Older patients or those from psychosomatic con-\nsultation-liaison service have less insight into psychody-\nnamic and psychosomatic associations and less motiva-\ntion for psychotherapy and higher motivation for physical \ntreatments. Franz et al.  [47] were able to determine that \nthe psychosomatic and physical limitations as well as the \ndifficulties in communication, as assessed by the OPD, \nare found in the SCL-90 R. \n Predictive Validity \n To investigate the predictive validity, psychotherapy \ninpatients were examined before and after treatment, and \nparallel to this SCR-90 R and IIP were determined. The \nbest predictor of therapy success was the characteristic \nmental symptom presentation of axis I. \n Construct Validity \n Factor analyses were performed to test the construct \nvalidity of axis I  [47] . A three-factor model with the \ncomponents insight, resources and body-related items \nexplained 54% of the variance. Another factor analysis \n [48] yielded five factors (break off criterion eigenvalue \n ! 1) which explained 68% of the variance. Factor I (so-\nmatic experience and illness processing) comprises se-\nverity of the somatic findings, extent of physical disabil-\nity as well as the physical symptom expression and a \nrather physically oriented treatment motivation. Factor \nII (mental experience and illness processing) contains \nlimitation through physical symptoms and self experi-\nence as well as motivation for psychotherapy. Factor III \n(capacity for insight) represents the insight capability of \nthe patient for psychodynamic, psychosomatic and so-\nmatopsychic associations. The fourth factor (resources \nand support) comprises the items for psychosocial inte-\ngration and support. The last factor (compliance) con-\nsists of compliance and secondary illness gain (nega-\ntively correlated). This factor analysis seems very plau-\nsible and confirms the constructs on which the axes are \nbased. \n In summary, these results illustrate the high clinical rel-\nevance of axis I. They allow statements about capacity and \nreadiness of the patient to engage in psychotherapeutic-\npsychosomatic intervention. On this basis, specific inter-\nventions can be undertaken as required which serve to pre-\npare the patient for psychotherapy in a narrower sense. \n Axis II \n Concurrent Validity \n The diagnostic window of the OPD relationship axis \nis related to dysfunctionalities in interpersonal areas. The \nIIP  [49] and the SASB  [10] are recognized as valid meth-\nods for this criterion area and were therefore introduced \nfor the purposes of concurrent validity (in the sense of an \ninternal criterion-related validity)  [50] . The resultant va-\nlidity coefficients are acceptable with a mean correlation \nof 0.21 for a comparison of a self- vs. observer-rated meth-\nod. In another study  [51] , the question of how well the \nOPD relationship diagnosis and the independent results \nof the SASB are in accordance with the relationship epi-\nsodes as represented in the OPD interviews was ad-\ndressed. It was shown that in the OPD relationship diag-\nnosis there was a higher than chance concordance with \nthe SASB rating of the individual episodes. Furthermore, \nit can be deduced that the judgment of the experience \nperspective of the patient (perspective A) in OPD axis II \nis oriented to the way of behavior most commonly named \nby the patient. \n Predictive Validity \n For an interpersonal understanding of psychopathol-\nogy, it is relevant of what quality relationship fantasies \nand treatment readiness are in the current interpersonal \nrelationships of the patient. The wishes the patient brings \nto the relationship are notably less flexibly described than \nthe reaction of the interaction partner  [52] . Cierpka et al. \n[53] proved that the rigidity of the interpersonal wishes \nis positively associated with the degree of psychopathol-\nogy. Assuming the circular variance of the behavior clus-\nter pictured by the OPD circumplex model, 100 psycho-\ntherapy inpatients were examined regarding change in \ninterpersonal flexibility  [54] . Individual diagnostic sub-\ngroups were separately compared before and after exam-\nination and the correlations of interpersonal outcome \nwere calculated. It was shown that for affectively dis-\nturbed persons (n = 28) and patients with adjustment dis-\norders (n = 13) the increase in interpersonal flexibility is \npositively associated with symptomatic improvement. \n Cierpka\/Grande\/Rudolf\/von der Tann\/\nStasch \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 216\nFor the subgroup of depressive patients, the Pearson cor-\nrelation for a one-tailed p was 0.02 between symptomatic \nimprovement (measured by the Global Severity Index \nGSI of the SCL-90 R) and change in interpersonal vari-\nability 0.39. The group with adjustment disorder had r = \n0.57 and p (one tailed) = 0.02; for those with anxiety dis-\norders (n = 12) there was, however, an opposite trend. In \nthis group, the symptomatic improvement correlated \nnegatively with an increase in variability (r = 0.42, one-\ntailed p = 0.08). This means that patients with anxiety \ndisorders benefit from increasing rigidity in interperson-\nal self-experience; a finding that can be explained through \nincreasing self-expression and definition from the wishes \nof others. These results show that the OPD relationship \ndiagnostics and the emerging measures thereof are ca-\npable of discriminating between different diagnostic \ngroups concerning symptomatic outcomes. \n Construct Validity \n The OPD relationship diagnostic is based on the so-\ncalled circumplex model of interpersonal behavior  [13, \n15] , which has a long tradition in personality, social and \nclinical psychology and has been accordingly validated. \nAs various authors have shown  [55, 56] , the circumplex \nmodel is a good predictive model and represents a nomo-\nlogical network which can be used for construct valida-\ntion. The construct validation was assumed on the basis \nof the German version of the IIP, the circumplex struc-\nture of which has been empirically proven  [50] . The re-\nsults relate to the sample described under Concordant \nValidity. It was shown that the majority of the OPD rela-\ntionship axis clusters conform to the construct, i.e. are \ncircular and possess specific interpersonal content. In a \ncriterion-specific comparison between the relationship \naxis and IIP, some content differences were shown re-\ngarding some behavior and experience clusters. \n Axis III \n Concordant Validity \n For the validation through other methods of the con-\ncordant validity of the unconscious conflicts described in \nthe OPD, there was a basic problem: there are no other \ninstruments which assess unconscious conflict in a gen-\nerally approved way  [57] . The bonding styles assessed in \nadults can be compared with individual conflicts, in par-\nticular with conflict I autonomy vs. dependence and con-\nflict III care vs. autarchy. Both conflicts deal with the \nbasic conflict topic of attachment; however, with different \nmanifestations. According to the Attachment Prototype \nRating  [58] three main categories of secure attachment, \nambivalent attachment (increased dependence, impul-\nsive-unstable and increased neediness) and avoidant at-\ntachment (anxious-avoidant, rational-controlled and in-\ncreased striving for autonomy) can be distinguished. Fif-\nty-five women with personality disorders were examined \naccording to the OPD and the Attachment Prototype \nRating  [59] . The rater concordances for the autonomy de-\npendence conflict as well as for the care vs. autarchy con-\nflict (kappa = 0.56) could be judged as good. Since this \nwas a sample of very sick patients, there were, as expected, \nno securely attached patients, 22% were ambivalent, 31% \navoidant and 47% showed a mixed attachment pattern. \nThe more ambivalent the attachment-style, the more \nprominent was the conflict care vs. autarchy; the more \navoidant the attachment-style, the more prominent was \nthe conflict autonomy vs. dependence and the less was \nthe conflict care vs. autarchy. In the global rating of the \nsecurity of the attachment, it was clear that the more se-\ncure the attachment was judged to be, the more the con-\nflict care vs. autarchy was prominent, and the less secure \nthe attachment, the more prominent the conflict auton-\nomy vs. dependence. These results give initial indications \nfor the validity of the conflict differentiation autonomy\/\ndependence vs. care\/autarchy. In a study from Ulm  [60] , \nthere was good agreement of the OPD conflicts with the \nCore Conflictual Relationship Theme  [3] in 44 psycho-\ntherapy inpatients. The investigations in Heidelberg and \nM\u00fcnster  [46, 61] showed predominance of conflicts I\u2013IV. \nOn the other hand, more of the conflict-limited percep-\ntion of conflicts and feelings is associated with greater \nphysical impairment; this finding also supports the de-\nscription of the conflicts. To validate the concept of the \ntypical leading affect as described in axis III, a study from \nLeising et al.  [51] used the methods already described: on \nthe basis of a clinical emotion list  [62] a frequency profile \nof self-reported affective experience was produced. An \nindependent rater had the task of comparing this profile \nwith the information on the 2 most important conflicts \nand the mode. By chance, a further foreign emotion was \nincluded. In 13 attempts, correct allocation occurred 9 \ntimes (p = 0.087). The authors conclude that the relation-\nship between mental conflict and the predominance of \ncertain leading affects is at least not as clear as assumed \nin the OPD manual. A further validation study  [63] in a \nsample of 48 psychosomatic inpatients correlated estima-\ntions of conflict using the Scale of Psychological Capaci-\nties (SPC) from Wallerstein  [64] . In contrast to the OPD, \nin the SPC apart from structural vulnerabilities which \ncomprise the content of the OPD structure axis, habitual \nmodes of conflict processing or defense formation are \n Operationalized Psychodynamic \nDiagnostics System \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 217\nalso assessed and subsumed under the term \u2018structural \ncapacity\u2019. For these subscales of the SPC, significant as-\nsociations with individual OPD conflicts were found, for \nexample a correlation of r = 0.41, p  ! 0.01 between the \nSPC scale moralism and the conflict submission vs. con-\ntrol or a correlation of r = 0.37, p  ! 0.05 between the SPC \nscale attribution of responsibility and the conflict guilt. \nIn total, 5 of 7 associations which were surmised on the \nbasis of a conceptual comparison of the scales could be \nsignificantly proven. \n Predictive Validity \n In 30 psychotherapeutically treated in patients, there \nwere no essential associations between prominent con-\nflicts and treatment success, with the exception of the \nconflict category deficient conflict and feeling percep-\ntion, which was obtained in none of the patients of the \ngroup with pronounced treatment success  [65] . In the in-\nvestigation of Rudolf et al.  [61] , the patients with predom-\ninant autonomy vs. dependence had less success. The \nconflicts oedipal\/sexual conflicts and control vs. submis-\nsion on the other hand showed a positive association with \ntreatment success. \n In conclusion, it can be determined that the scientific \ndifficulties in the testing of the validity are great since for \nevery conflict there are only external criteria or appropri-\nate encircling test methods to assess whether unconscious \nconflicts are not present. The conflict systematics is prac-\nticable and useful for training and for clinical questions. \nTo date, examined individual conflicts show good concor-\ndance and differentiation with related tests. Adequate con-\nnection between the defined operationalized conflicts and \nthe construct dynamic conflict can therefore be assumed. \n Axis IV \n Concordant Validity \n A number of studies dealt with the agreement between \nstructure evaluation and other concurrently obtained \ndata. Nitzgen and Br\u00fcnger  [66] examined 137 male pa-\ntients with chronic substance abuse at the start of an in-\npatient admission and showed that these patients had the \npoorest values in the area of self-control (mean = 2.2; 2 \ncorresponds to moderate, 3 to poorly integrated). This \nresult was also theoretically expected since this structure \narea comprises among others the aspects tolerance of af-\nfect and impulse control. These findings are confirmed \nby a study of Reymann et al.  [67] where structural weak-\nness in self-control as well as in object perception was \nascertained in 22 alcohol-dependent males on a detoxifi-\ncation ward. Further indications of validity were ob-\ntained by the first mentioned study with respect to con-\ncordance with ICD-10 diagnoses. Patients who had ICD \ndiagnoses of neuroses (mean = 1.97) showed themselves \nto be better structured than patients with personality dis-\norders (mean = 2.37, p  ! 0.01). Rudolf et al.  [61] showed \nthat a lower structural level is associated with longer du-\nration of mental illness (\u20130.38, p = 0.06), which may be \ndue to the structurally determined poorer regulation of \nthese patients. To the second group of validation studies, \nwhich chose inner validity criteria, belongs a study of \nSchauenburg  [68] . In this study, 49 consecutively admit-\nted psychotherapy inpatients were examined. Secure at-\ntachment (Pilkonis attachment diagnosis; \u20130.30, p = \n0.05) as well as excessive striving for independence \n(\u20130.29, p = 0.06) were associated with better structural \nlevel, whilst borderline traits (0.27, p = 0.08), excessive \nautonomy strivings (0.32, p = 0.03) and antisocial traits \n(0.55, p = 0.00) were associated with poorer structural \nlevel. In the same sample, Gr\u00fctering and Schauenburg \n [69] compared with independent judgments the scales of \nthe Karolinska Psychodynamic Profile with the dimen-\nsions of the structure axis and found expected correla-\ntions concerning content: the capacity of self-control was \nassociated with the scales intimacy and tolerance of frus-\ntration. Likewise there was an association between high-\ner integration and object perception or communication \nand the capacity to experience intimacy. In the study of \nGrande et al.  [63] , the SPCs were compared with the \nstructural characteristics measured by the OPD. There \nwere numerous associations which were to be expected \non the basis of a conceptual comparison of the scales of \nboth instruments e.g. a correlation of r = 0.30, p  ! 0.05 \nbetween the OPD scale drive and the dimension self-con-\ntrol. Furthermore there was a significant concordance \nbetween low structure level according to OPD and the \nSPC scales emotional blunting (r = 0.41, p  ! 0.01) and \nrarely able to rely on others (r = 0.43, p  ! 0.01). These two \nitems relate more than other items of the SPC to the in-\nterpersonal capacity of a person and are therefore espe-\ncially related to the theoretical concept of the OPD struc-\nture axis, which places the capabilities and vulnerabili-\nties of the self in its relationship to others in the center of \nthe structural analysis. \n Predictive Validity \n The already mentioned study of Rudolf et al.  [61] ad-\ndresses the predictive validity. The structure evaluation \nat the beginning of inpatient treatment was shown to be \na very good predictor of the treatment success as judged \nby both the patient (0.30) and the therapist (0.40, p  ! \n Cierpka\/Grande\/Rudolf\/von der Tann\/\nStasch \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 218\n0.05). The view of the individual structure dimensions \nindicates that bonding capability (patient, 0.42; therapist \n0.46, p  ! 0.01) is especially relevant for the prediction. \nObviously, the capacity to imbue others with positive af-\nfect is a good guaranty for the success of the interperson-\nal therapeutic project. \n Construct Validity \n Regarding construct validity, a Heidelberg study \nshowed in a factor analysis (unpublished) that the items \nare weighted on a single main factor with a very high ei-\ngenvalue. The internal consistency of 0.87 for the struc-\nture dimension and 0.96 for the structure foci points in a \nsimilar direction. These results also indicate that struc-\nture concerns an essentially unidimensional construct \nand the various parts of structure act independently. Since \naccording to theoretical and clinical understanding struc-\ntural constitution represents a durable and stable person-\nal characteristic, the construct validity of the structure \naxis is also supported by the fact that an inpatient com-\nparison before and after a 12-week treatment showed sta-\nble structural values (for structure, in total a pre- and \nposttreatment concordance of 84.4% was found)  [28] . \n In summary, the OPD structure axis according to cur-\nrent experience seems suitable to describe a psychody-\nnamically conceptualized and interpersonal point of \nview in the sense of object relations theory personality \nstructure  [70, 71] . \n These studies on the validity of the OPD show that the \nOPD axes show no clear significant associations with the \nsymptom diagnosis according to ICD-10. This corre-\nsponds to the function of the OPD as an additional psy-\nchodynamic-diagnostic level. The reliability of the indi-\nvidual axes as well as the validity studies underpin the \nempirical basis of the instrumentarium if used as a re-\nsearch instrument. \n Conclusion \n Since the OPD manual was published in 1996, many \npsychotherapists have become acquainted with it and \nhave used it. Various translations are available. In 2003, \nthe German child and adolescent version was published \n [72] . More than 3,000 therapists have been trained in the \ndifferent training centers in German-speaking countries. \nIn various psychosomatic clinics, abuse clinics, univer-\nsity departments for psychotherapy and psychosomatics, \nthe OPD is used in research projects, but also in the clin-\nical day-to-day practice  [18] . Current work on the further \ndevelopment of the OPD system is directed towards im-\nproving focus formulation and the therapy goal defini-\ntion and thus the clinical applicability, so the system can \nbe more used in day-to-day practice. The new OPD-II \nversion was published in spring 2006  [73] . \n An operationalization of psychodynamic diagnostics \ncan overcome the boundaries of a purely descriptive psy-\nchiatric classification and use the advantages of an op-\nerationalization of empirical psychodynamic constructs \nin association with the phenomenological diagnostic. \nThe OPD can: \n 1 Give clinical-diagnostic guidelines for clinical use, \nwhich because of relative openly formulated diagnos-\ntic criteria (guidelines) allow the user some freedom. \nThe OPD contributes thus to greater transparence in \nthe sense of quality assurance. \n 2 Be very useful for psychodynamic psychotherapy \ntraining, since the operationalized mental phenomena \nare empirically formulated so the psychodynamic and \nphenomenological classification can be practiced. \n 3 Be used as a research instrument, to contribute to \nmore homogenization of trial samples through strict-\ner diagnostic criteria. \n 4 Contribute to better communication within the scien-\ntific community (in a broader and a narrower sense) \nconcerning psychodynamic constructs. Through clear-\nly improved reliability, the OPD contributes to better \ncommunicability of psychodynamic formulations. \n The richness but also the limitations of the OPD diag-\nnostics are illustrated in the judgment of a videotaped \ncase and discussion thereof. The OPD is aimed to be no \nmore than a basic compendium of the relevant psychody-\nnamic constructs, which are allocated to 4 axes. The OPD \nmanual provides only the basis for the clinical discussion, \nwhich is highly valued, however, by many clinics. Psycho-\ntherapists with little experience have a basis for further \ntraining. More complex psychoanalytic theories and de-\ntailed psychoanalytic case conception can be built on the \nbasis of the OPD. \n Experience with the OPD system to date shows that \nthe constructed axes are practicable and reliable for clin-\nical use in very different treatment fields. The working \ngroup understands the operationalization of psychody-\nnamic diagnostics as a process that should contribute to \nfurther clarification and differentiation of the underlying \nconstructs both in practice and in research. \n \n Operationalized Psychodynamic \nDiagnostics System \n Psychopathology 2007;40:209\u2013220 219\n References \n 1 Bellak L, Hurvich M: Systematic study of ego \nfunctions.
