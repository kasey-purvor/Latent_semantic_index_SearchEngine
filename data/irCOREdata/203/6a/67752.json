Ollivier, T. Encrenaz, F. Roques, F. Selsis and F. Casoli, Springer, 2009, pp.\nxiii + 340. Scope: monograph. ISBN 978 3 540 75747 4. Level: undergraduate and\npostgraduate physicists and researchers.\nAre we alone in the Universe? Or are there myriads of other habitable worlds teeming\nwith life and intelligence? These are questions of long standing, going back at least to\nthe ancient Greeks, e.g. Epicurus (341-270 BC) who opined: \u201cThere are infinite worlds\nsimilar to and different from our own\u201d. Until the end of the 20th century, however, all was\nspeculation because the necessary observational techniques did not exist. It is only very\nrecently, in the last decade, that the situation has started to change. Although we are still\ncannot answer the questions about life, there has been an avalanche of evidence pointing\nto the existence of exoplanets, i.e. extra-solar planets in orbits around other stars. The\nauthors have set out to provide a detailed snapshot of this rapidly developing research\nfield at a particularly exciting moment in its evolution.\nAt the core of the book, always there in the background even when not being discussed\nexplicitly, is the question of whether or not our solar system is typical. If so, numerous\nother planetary systems of a similar kind are to be anticipated; where the central star is\nof similar mass to the Sun, many of them will include Earth-like planets. The antithesis\nalso applies, of course. If the solar system was formed as the result of an unusual and\nspecial event, e.g. a close encounter between the Sun and another star, then the occurrence\nof planetary systems would correspondingly be rare. The discovery of several hundred\nexoplanets during the last few years suggests that planetary systems are actually rather\ncommon, especially given the extreme difficulty of making and analysing the observations,\nwhich means that most exoplanets probably remain undetectable.\nThe direct detection of exoplanets, in the sense of detecting separately the photons\nemitted from the planet and from the star, is virtually impossible. The angle subtended\nbetween the sources is too small, and the emissions from the planet too weak compared to\nthe brilliance of the star. The authors liken the problem to \u201c...trying to observe a glow-\nworm 30 cm from a lighthouse in Marseille, when the observer is in Paris (at a distance\nof about 700 km)\u201d. The problem is exacerbated by the existence of the zodiacal light\nemitted by dust in the plane of the ecliptic. So in practice exoplanets must be detected\nby indirect means: by observing their effect on the motion of the star, or by measuring\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 51, 561-562 (2010).\nthe slight reduction in light coming from the star as the planet passes in front of it.\nGiven the difficulties and indirectnesses of the observations, it is hardly surprising that\nmost of the exoplanets discovered so far are relatively large, often Jupiter-like, objects that\nare easier to detect than Earth-sized planets. But this will surely change over the next\nfew years as the observational methods are further refined. Already, there are several\nsurprises including numerous \u201cexoJupiters\u201d 50 or 100 times closer to their stars than\nJupiter is to the Sun. There is also the question of why many exoplanets seem to have far\nmore elliptical orbits than those of our own planets, which are mostly well-approximated\nas circular. The authors mention in their Preface that, just after completion of the rest\nof the book, the space mission COROT discovered \u201c...an enigmatic object between a star\nand a planet with a density twice that of platinum\u201d. There will probably be a profusion\nof comparably unexpected observations in the coming years.\nThe authors have given a full and detailed coverage of their subject, dealing with\ndetection methods, what is known of stellar and planetary evolution, planetary dynamics\nincluding migration phenomena where planets move to different orbits, and a discussion\nof the search for life and its likely prevalence. The book is well-written and translated\nand, despite the large number of authors, it hangs together as a coherent whole without\ntoo much repetition (though the memorable image of the surface of Titan, recorded by\nthe Huygens probe, appears twice). The text is illuminated by numerous figures and\ngraphs. Appendices describing e.g. gravitation, Kepler\u2019s Law, Black-body radiation, and\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram are provided to help the general reader. The authors\npredict that \u2018exoEarths\u201d \u2013 planets with masses comparable with that of the Earth \u2013\nwill be detected within the decade. Of course, detecting possible biosignatures in their\natmospheres presents a far more challenging problem, and they prudently refrain from\nhazarding a guess as to how long it will take to solve.\nAlthough the questions mentioned at the beginning still remain unanswered, Planetary\nSystems provides an excellent account of the enormous progress that has been made in\nrecent years, together with a discussion of the prospects for the years to come. It is a\nfascinating book that can be read with interest by any physicist.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University\np.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\n2\n"}
