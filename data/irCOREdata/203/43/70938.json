INTRODUCTION\nInvestigation of the stability and control of a lasing mode addresses an important problem in the applied theory of\nlasers.1 It is one that can also be mapped onto an analysis of bursting behavior arising in population dynamics.2\nIn a more general context such an analysis describes a fundamental problem in the theory of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems.3, 4 It is potentially of relevance in biology where switching takes place between distinct regimes of\nbehaviour, e.g. in cardiac and cortical systems. While the topic is thus of broad interdisciplinary interest,\nlaser systems can provide especially reliable and convincing tests of the new theoretical concepts. In general,\nthe problem can be analyzed within either one of two theoretical and experimental frameworks: using either\ncontinuous or discrete time, with corresponding descriptions of the system dynamics in terms of either continuous\nflows or maps. Both methods have been extensively tested in application to laser systems. For example, a special\nprotocol was been developed for the feedback control of steady generation in Nd lasers that have a tendency to\nself-pulsing.5 To get over the uncertainty in switching, the methods of stochastic resonance together with an\nadditional weak periodic modulation have been proposed.6, 7 The targeting of stable and unstable orbits has been\ndiscussed8 and achieved experimentally by the use of a single large amplitude perturbation in a loss-modulated\nCO2 laser9, 10 with special attention being paid to minimization of the duration of the transient processes.\nHowever, a direct comparison between these two general methods for the analysis of stability and control\nof a steady state has not so far been considered, which is perhaps surprising given its broad interdisciplinary\nimplications.\nIn this paper we consider, both theoretically and numerically, a direct comparison between the continuous\nand discrete forms of control of the lasing mode in class B lasers. In particular, we demonstrate that the two\nmethods give estimates of the activation \u201cenergy\u201d and of the energy of the control function that differ by an\norder of magnitude. We use the duality of the control and stability problems discussed in our earlier work11, 12\nto provide insight into the origin of this difference.\nIn particular, we investigate the energy-optimal control of switching in a periodically-driven class-B laser\nbetween its stable and unstable pulsing regimes. Coexistence of nonstationary states can be realized experimen-\ntally in lasers e.g. by periodic modulation of intracavity loss9, 13 or of pumping rate.14\u201319 Here we study the\nlater case because it is more suitable for class B solid-state lasers including microchip lasers and semiconductor\nlasers.\nCorrespondence to: p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\nPublished in Noise in Complex Systems and Stochastic Dynamics III, eds.

CONTINUOUS MODEL AND MAP\nOur analysis is based on single-mode rate equations{\ndu\ndt = vu(y \u2212 1),\ndy\ndt = q + k cos(\u03c9t)\u2212 y \u2212 yu+ f(t),\n(1)\nwhere u and y are proportional to the density of radiation and carrier inversion respectively, v is the ratio of\nthe photon damping rate in the cavity to the rate of carrier inversion relaxation, the cavity loss is normalized to\nunity, and the pumping rate has a constant term q and a periodic component; k and \u03c9 are the amplitude and\nfrequency of the external periodic modulation. The additive unconstrained control function is f(t).\nFor class-B lasers the parameter v is large, v \u223c 103 \u2212 104, and provides for regimes of the spiking type\nunder deep modulation of the pumping rate. Solutions can be obtained from the corresponding two-dimensional\nPoincare\u00b4 map20: {\nci+1 = q +G(ci, \u03c8i)e\u2212T +K cos(\u03c9T + \u03c8i) + fi,\n\u03d5i+1 = \u03d5i + \u03c9T,mod 2pi,\n(2)\nwhere G(ci, \u03c8i) = ci \u2212 g \u2212 q \u2212K cos\u03c8i, K = k(1 + \u03c92)\u22121\/2, and \u03c8i = \u03d5i \u2212 arctan(\u03c9). The control function fi is\nnow defined in discrete time. Functions g = g(ci) and T = T (ci, \u03d5i) are positive roots of the equations\ng \u2212 ci(1\u2212 exp(\u2212g)) = 0,\n(q \u2212 1)T +G(ci, \u03c8i)(1\u2212 e\u2212T ) +K\u03c9\u22121[sin(\u03c9T + \u03c8i)\u2212 sin\u03c8i] = 0,\nrespectively. Variables ci, \u03d5i correspond to the inversion of population y(ti) and to the phase of modulation\n\u03d5i = \u03c9ti,mod 2pi at the moments ti of pulse onset when u(ti) = 1, u\u02d9(ti) > 0, g(ci) denotes the energy of the\npulse, and T (ci, \u03d5i) gives the time interval between sequential pulses. The map has been derived by asymptotic\nintegration of Eqs.(1) to an accuracy of O(v\u22121). It is therefore valid for q, k, \u03c9 \u00bf v and ci > 1 +O(v\u22121).\nFor each iteration of the map one can find characteristics directly comparable with experimental measure-\nments: the phase of the modulation signal at the moment of the spike and the interval between pulses, the energy\nof the spike and its maximal intensity given by umax = 1 + v[ci \u2212 1\u2212 ln(ci)].\nThe fixed points of the map determine spiking solutions of the period multiple to the period of driving,\nTn = nTM , n = 1, 2, ... where the period of driving is TM = 2pi\/\u03c9. They are born through a saddle-node\nbifurcation at the modulation threshold level\nksn =\n\u221a\n1 + \u03c92[q \u2212 Cn \u2212 gn(eTn \u2212 1)\u22121]. (3)\nThe stable cycles undergo a period-doubling bifurcation if the modulation level exceeds\nkpd =\n\u221a\n1 + \u03c92\n\u03c9\n(q \u2212 1)\n[\n1 + 2pi\n(\nqnTn\n12\n)2\n+O(T 4n)\n]\n. (4)\nIn this way we determine analytically the regions where generalized multistability is realized as the coexistence\nof a number of cycles, and we can approximate the location of saddles and stable cycles in the phase space.\n3. CONTROL PROBLEM\nWe now consider the problem of controlled migration between the stable and saddle cycles that are related to\nthe saddle-node bifurcation (3) and which are of the same amplitude and period. Specifically, we will study\nmigration from the stable cycle C3 to the saddle cycle S3. As mentioned above, such a process can be proposed\nfor the phase-coding information scheme because these cycles differ from each other only by virtue of their phase\nrelationship to the modulation signal. Within the framework of the method proposed, switching between stable\ncycles with different periods and amplitudes can be also considered quite generally for an amplitude coding\nscheme as well as for a combination of phase and amplitude coding.\nTwo different forms of the control force f(t) are considered: one is continuous fc(t) in time; and the other\nis a sequence of discrete impulses fd(t) =\n\u2211\niA\n\u222b\nfi\u03b4(t \u2212 \u03c4i)dt, \u03c4i \u2208 [ti + \u03c4c], applied at the moments when the\nsystem crosses the Poincare\u00b4 section u(ti) = 1, u\u02d9(ti) > 0, i.e. coinciding with the laser spikes. Here A is a constant\ndefined experimentally to transform the map force fi to the control force fd(t) for the continuous system (1);\n\u03c4c is the duration of an impulse of amplitudes Afi. In other words, in the case of the discrete impulse force we\nfirst solve the control problem for the map (2) and then apply our results for the system (1) by determination of\nthe constant A. We must note that for the selected Poincare\u00b4 section u(ti) = 1, u\u02d9(ti) > 0 the duration of control\npulses \u03c4c should be less than or comparable with the duration of the laser spikes \u223c v; in the opposite case the\nmap (2) with the force fi is not valid.\nThe following energy-optimal control problem is considered: How can the system (1) with unconstrained\ncontrol function fc(t) or fd(t) be steered between coexisting states such that the \u201dcost\u201d functional Jc or Jd\nJc = inf\nf\u2208F\n1\n2\n\u222b t1\nt0\nf2(t)dt, Jd = inf\nf\u2208F\n1\n2\nN\u2211\ni=1\nf2i (5)\nis minimized? Here t1 (or N) is unspecified and F is the set of control functions.\nThe solution of this problem is in general a very complicated task. It was shown in our earlier research,11, 21\nhowever, that if a solution of the control problem (u\u00af(t),q(t)) exists, then it can be identified with the solution\nof the corresponding problem of optimal fluctuational escape, and Pontryagin\u2019s Hamiltonian (see e.g.22) of the\ncontrol theory can be identified with the Wentzel-Freidlin Hamiltonian4 of the theory of fluctuations. This inter-\nrelationship is intuitively clear because, in thermal equilibrium (D = 4\u0393kBT ), the probability of fluctuations is\ndetermined by the minimum work from the external source needed to produce the given change in the thermo-\ndynamic quantities \u03c1 \u221d exp(\u2212Rmin\/kBT ).23 It was therefore suggested that the optimal control function u\u00af(t)\ncan be found via statistical analysis of the optimal fluctuational force.11, 21, 24, 25 Similar ideas are applicable to\nthe analysis of the control problem in maps.26 In this technique the control functions f(t) and fi in (1) and (2)\nare replaced by additive white Gaussian noise and the dynamics of the system is followed continuously. Several\ndynamical variables of the system and the random force are recorded simultaneously, and the statistics of all\nactual trajectories along which the system moves in a particular subspace of the coordinate space is then ana-\nlyzed.27\u201329 The so-called prehistory probability distribution of these trajectories that move the system from the\nequilibrium state to the remote state is sharply peaked about the optimal fluctuational path, thereby providing a\nsolution to the control problem. We note, that this technique provides an experimental approach to the solution\nof the control problem, which is especially useful from the point of view of practical applications.\nIn the case of continuous control, it is useful to change variables\n\u00b2 = v\u22121\/2, \u03c4 = \u00b2\u22121t, \u2126 = \u00b2\u03c9,\nz = \u00b2\u22121(y \u2212 1), x = lnu.\nFollowing the Pontryagin theory of optimal control, we then reduce the energy-minimal migration task to bound-\nary problems for the Hamilton equation (cf.11, 21)\nx\u02d9 = z,\nz\u02d9 = q \u2212 1 + k cos(\u2126\u03c4)\u2212 ex(1 + \u00b2z)\u2212 \u00b2z + p2,\np\u02d91 = p2ex(1 + \u00b2z),\np\u02d92 = \u2212p1 + p2\u00b2(1 + ex), (6)\nwith the boundary conditions\nx(\u03c4s) = xs, z(\u03c4s) = zs, p1(\u03c4s) = 0, p2(\u03c4s) = 0, (7)\nx(\u03c4e) = xe, z(\u03c4e) = ze, p1(\u03c4e) = 0, p2(\u03c4e) = 0, (8)\nwhere {xs, zs, \u03c4s} and {xe, ze, \u03c4e} are initial and final states correspondingly, with \u03c4s \u2192 \u2212\u221e and \u03c4e \u2192\u221e.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\n \u03d5i\n \ny i\n(a) \nC3 S3 \nC2 S2 \nC1 S1 \nS1 S1 C4 \nC4 \nC4 \n50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130\n\u221280\n\u221270\n\u221260\n\u221250\n\u221240\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n10\n t\/TM\n \nx\n (b) \n50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130\n\u22120.015\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n t\/TM\n \nf\n (c) \nFigure 1.

The stable cycle C3 and saddle cycle S3 are marked by \u201c\u00d7\u201d and \u201c\u2022\u201d\nrespectively.\nThe solution of the continuous control problem for transitions C3 \u2192 S3 was found by application of a\ncombination of the statistical approach discussed above and the numerical solution of the boundary problem for\nthe Hamiltonian system (6). The Poincare` cross-section for the system (1) and corresponding solution of the\ncontrol problem for transitions C3 \u2192 S3 (x(\u03c4), p2(\u03c4)) are shown in Fig. 1.\nNumerical simulations confirm that the control function f(\u03c4) = p2(\u03c4) obtained induces migration from the\ncycle C3 to the cycle S3 in the optimal regime. Similar results are obtained for transition C2 \u2192 S2.\nIn the case of discrete time control the Pontryagin theory of optimal control can be extended to obtain an\narea-preserving map:\nci+1 = q +G(c,\u03c8i)e\u2212T +K cos(\u03c9T + \u03c8i) + pci+1\n\u03d5i+1 = \u03d5i + \u03c9T, mod2pi,(\npci+1\np\u03d5i+1\n)\n=\n(\n\u2202ci+1\n\u2202ci\n\u2202ci+1\n\u2202\u03d5i\n\u2202\u03d5i+1\n\u2202ci\n\u2202\u03d5i+1\n\u2202\u03d5i\n)\u22121(\npci\np\u03d5i\n)\n(9)\nwith the boundary conditions: {\ncs = cs, \u03d5s = \u03d5s, pcs = 0, p\u03d5s = 0,\nce = ce, \u03d5e = \u03d5e, pce = 0, p\u03d5e = 0,\n(10)\nwhere s = \u2212\u221e and e =\u221e are initial and final time moments.\nThe corresponding boundary value problem (9), (10) for transitions C3 \u2192 S3 can be solved using either the\nstatistical approach or a shooting method. However, because of the complexity of the map, the accuracy of both\nmethods is limited and only allows us to identify a nearly optimal discrete control function.\nThe results of such an analysis for the transition C3 \u2192 S3 in the map (2) are shown in Fig. 2. The statistical\napproach gives superior results, the corresponding energy Jstat \u2248 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22123, being less than the energy found\nby the shooting method, Jshoot \u2248 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 (and twice smaller then the energy of a single control pulse\nJsingle = 1.6\u00d7 10\u22122). Similar results are obtained from analysis of the optimal transition C2 \u2192 S2.\nIn the next step we defined experimentally a value of the constant A for all the types of pulsed control\nfunction considered, in order to apply the map results to the continuous system (1). The results are summarized\nin the Table 1.\nNumerical analysis has also revealed the dependence of the energy of the discrete control function fd(t) on\nthe duration of the control pulses \u03c4c. It was found that there is an optimal duration \u03c4optc for which the total\nenergy of the control function has a minimum. Note that the optimal duration is still less than the duration of\nthe laser spike, so that the map (2) is applicable.\n4. DISCUSSION: DISCRETE PULSES VERSUS CONTINUOUS CONTROL\nA direct comparison between continuous and different discrete methods of control is given in Table 1. It follows\nfrom our analysis (see Table 1) that continuous control is considerably more efficient energetically then the\ndiscrete form of control. In turn a discrete control function consisting of a sequence of pulses (multi-pulsed force)\nis more efficient then single pulse control function. That can be explained by the small duration \u03c4 of impulses\nof discrete force. As can be seen in Table 1 the energies of the discrete control functions can be decreased\nby several order of magnitude by optimization of impulse duration and the location of the impulse. But the\noptimized energy of the discrete control function still exceeds the energy of the continuous force by three orders\nof magnitude.\nThus we see that, although the continuous and discrete models of a laser describe very well the system\ndynamics on larger time scales and provide quantitatively similar basins of attractions for the stable limit cycles,\nestimates of stability and of the energies of optimal control functions may differ by orders of magnitude. One\nof possible reason for this lies in the particular form of control function fi in the map (2): we choose the force\nthat is additive in the map. So we can expect another conclusion for other form of control function fi.

It\nis seen that the force f(t) has a rather complex structure, but that it can be fitted by a sequence of pulses. The\nduration of these pulses is close to the period of the cycle C2 or to the time interval between laser spikes, i.e.\nit is \u223c 3TM , TM is the period of external driving. Further we note that external driving changes the value of\npump, i.e. the parameter q. This observation allows us to suggest a new form of control for the map:\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 ci+1 = qi +G(ci, \u03c8i, qi)e\n\u2212T +K cos(\u03c9T + \u03c8i) + fi,\n\u03d5i+1 = \u03d5i + \u03c9T,mod 2pi,\nqi+1 = qi + fi,\n(11)\nhere the value of q is constant between the Poincare\u00b4 sections and it changes at the moment of the cross-section.\nFor this map (11) we formulate the same boundary problem as for the map (2), we can use the same method\nto determine the control function. The results of a prehistory analysis (Fig. 3) and the result for single pulse\nin the map 11) are presented in two last columns of Table 1. The energy of the control function is significantly\ndecreased but it is still nearly twice as large as the energy of the continuous function.\nSummarizing, we have found the energy-optimal control function for effecting migration of a B-class laser\nfrom its stable limit cycle to a saddle cycle, for both continuous and discrete forms of control. This allowed\nus to compare directly the efficiency of the two technique and to show that continuous control provides a more\nenergy-efficient form of control as compared to discrete control, and that it provides more accurate estimates\nof the stability of quasi-stable states. Moreover analysis of the shape of the continuous function allows us to\nsuggest the discrete control function that approaches continuous efficiency. We note that specific targeting of\nthe periodic orbits has been achieved experimentally by single-shot short-lived perturbation of intracavity losses\nin a CO2 laser30, 31 that can be described by the continuous and discrete laser equations used in this paper. The\nresults obtained can be directly verified in experiment, therefore, and applied e.g. to the phase coding information\nscheme.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK), the Wellcome\nTrust, and INTAS (grant 01-867).
