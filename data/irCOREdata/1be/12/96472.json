There is general agreement that commu-\nnity involvement enhances the effectiveness of\na range of biomedical and behavioural HIV\/AIDS\ninterventions. It does this through facilitating the\nempowerment of AIDS-affected communities to take\ncontrol over their health, increasing the likelihood that\ncommunity members will engage in health-enhancing\nbehaviour change in relation to prevention, care and\ntreatment. While this assumption is theoretically\nwell-grounded, it has been difficult to apply in\npractice. While some community mobilisation efforts\nsuccessfully establish an organised, unified and action-\noriented group, becoming a force for health-enhancing\nchange, others fail miserably, further undermining\ncommunity confidence and capability. To understand\nthe reasons for success and failure of community\nmobilisation initiatives, this special issue examines\nhow the wider social contexts of interventions\ncan support or undermine community mobilisation\nefforts.\nIn this paper, we present a conceptual framework\nfor examining those dimensions of social context which\nare likely to support or to undermine the effectiveness\nof community mobilisation initiatives. We propose\nattention should be given to three dimensions of\ncontext: material, symbolic and relational, illustrating\nthis argument with reference to existing research in\n*Corresponding author.

Firstly we outline the\nreasons for our interest in community mobilisation,\npresenting the core concept underlying the work in this\nspecial issue, namely the notion of \u2018\u2018health-enabling\nsocial environments\u2019\u2019, which we define as the commu-\nnity contexts most likely to enable and support the\npossibility of health-enhancing behaviour change.\nSecondly we map out three \u2018\u2018generations\u2019\u2019 of ap-\nproaches to behaviour change within HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement: HIV-awareness, peer education and\ncommunity mobilisation. We critically evaluate\neach one\u2019s underlying assumptions about the social\npsychology of behaviour change, to frame our under-\nstandings of the psycho-social pathways between\nmobilisation and health, drawing on the concepts of\nsocial capital, dialogue and empowerment.\nThirdly we draw on two well-documented case\nstudies to develop and illustrate our claim that\ncommunity mobilisation is unlikely to succeed in\nthe absence of supportive social contexts \u0001 using our\nthree dimensional characterisation of the material,\nsocial and relational contexts of community mobilisa-\ntion. We argue that much work remains to be done in\ndeveloping actionable conceptualisations of context\nto inform both research and practice in the commu-\nnity mobilisation field. Finally we highlight how the\nspecial issue\u2019s papers help us flesh out our concep-\ntualisation of the material, symbolic and relational\ndimensions of context. We argue for the need for\na fourth generation of approaches to behaviour\nchange in HIV\/AIDS management research and\npractice \u0001 one which pays far greater attention to\nthe wider contextual influences than is currently the\ncase in the theory and practice of community\nmobilisation.\nBackground\nBillions of dollars have been poured into HIV\/AIDS\ninterventions \u0001 health education, condom distribu-\ntion, voluntary counselling and testing, antiretroviral\ndrug treatments and so on. In many contexts, how-\never, HIV rates continue to rise, stigma remains\nstubbornly resistant to change, and access and ad-\nherence to treatment and support remain inconsistent\n(Gregson et al., 2007). A small number of interven-\ntions have worked well under carefully controlled\nresearch conditions, but these have been difficult to\nscale-up in less highly monitored \u2018\u2018real world\u2019\u2019 settings\n(Chopra & Ford, 2005; Greig, Peacock, Jewkes, &\nMsimang, 2008; Poku & Sandkjaer, 2007).\nOne reason for the disappointing outcomes of\nmany programmes is that they are conceived by\nexternal experts and imposed on communities in\n\u2018\u2018top-down\u2019\u2019 ways. As a result, they fail to resonate\nwith the worldviews and perceived needs and interests\nof their target groupings, or to take adequate account\nof the complex social relations into which pro-\ngrammes are inserted (Gruber & Caffrey, 2005;\nPfeiffer, 2003). Too often target communities are\nseen as passive recipients of prevention, care and\ntreatment services (the \u2018\u2018objects\u2019\u2019 of interventions)\nrather than active participants working in partnership\nwith health professionals to improve their health (the\n\u2018\u2018subjects\u2019\u2019 of interventions) (Campbell, 2003).\nFurthermore little attention is given to the \u2018\u2018goodness\nof fit\u2019\u2019 between programme goals and contextual\nconstraints and possibilities shaping the behaviour\nof target group members.\nCommunity involvement is increasingly being cited\nas a vital precondition for creating \u2018\u2018health-enabling\u2019\u2019\nsocial environments \u0001 social contexts that enable and\nsupport people in optimising their opportunities for\nhealth and well-being (Tawil, Verster, & O\u2019Reilly,\n1995, p. 1299). It is said to play a vital role in ena-\nbling health-related behaviours and reducing HIV-\ntransmission (van Wyk, Strebel, Peltzer, & Skinner,\n2006), stigma reduction (Poku & Sandkjaer, 2007),\nfacilitating timely and appropriate accessing of health\nand welfare services where these exist (Hadley\n& Maher, 2001; Segall, 2003), and supporting optimal\ntreatment adherence (Coetzee et al., 2004).\nThere are three reasons for our interest in com-\nmunity mobilisation. Firstly, community mobilisation\nis given a key role in international AIDS policy, due to\nits perceived role in tackling the challenges of \u2018\u2018reach\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018sustainability\u2019\u2019 that plague many HIV\/AIDS\ninterventions. Policies envisage that community-\nbased organisations play a central role in taking\nresponsibility for HIV\/AIDS. The scale of the pro-\nblem, as well as the social marginalisation of many\naffected groups, make it impossible for health and\nwelfare professionals and services to reach the vast\nnumber and variety of people vulnerable to HIV and\naffected by AIDS. Policy documents consistently\nargue that community organisations are better placed\nthan formal public services to reach \u2018\u2018hard-to-reach\u2019\u2019\ngroups (including, for example, women or young\npeople in high-risk settings, macho men, sex workers,\ninjecting drug users, men who have sex with men,\nresidents of remote or poorly served rural areas and\nso on). Furthermore community organisations, draw-\ning on local human resources, and often including the\ninputs of unpaid volunteers, are seen as more\nsustainable in the long-term than costly and donor-\ndependent external interventions.\n1570 C.

Here,\ncommunity volunteers are earmarked for an increased\nrole in HIV\/AIDS management within the wider\ncontext of the international \u2018\u2018task shifting\u2019\u2019 agenda\n(World Health Organisation, 2008). A growing num-\nber of projects rely on grassroots community mem-\nbers to provide HIV-prevention and AIDS-care\n(Ogden, Esim, & Grown, 2006; Schneider, Hlophe,\n& van Rensberg, 2008; van Damme, Kober, & Laga,\n2006). The final reason is a social psychological one.\nThe mobilisation of HIV\/AIDS vulnerable commu-\nnities to participate in effective community organisa-\ntions provides valuable opportunities through which\npeople can develop a stronger sense of agency. This\nincreases the likelihood that they will behave in\nhealth-enhancing ways (Bandura, 1995; Wallerstein,\n1992), and enables them to collectively tackle pro-\nblems that are undermining their health. Effective\nand empowering community mobilisation cannot\ntake place in the absence of a supportive social\nenvironment however. This special issue seeks to\nmap out those dimensions of a social environment\nthat impact on the potential success of community\nmobilisation \u0001 through providing case studies of the\ncontexts of community mobilisation in the Gambia,\nEast Africa, India, Kenya, Papua New Guinea,\nCambodia and South Africa.\nThree generations of behaviour change approaches \u0001\ntowards a fourth generation?\nIn this section we identify three dominant approaches\nto HIV\/AIDS management, showing such approaches\nhave evolved from an early emphasis on the individual\nas locus of change (HIV awareness approaches) to the\npeer group as locus of change (peer education\napproaches) to the community as locus of change\n(community mobilisation approaches). We will argue\nfor the need for a fourth approach, which pays\nattention to the wider social changes that would enable\noptimally effective community mobilisation efforts.\nWhilst we refer to these as three \u2018\u2018generations\u2019\u2019 of\napproaches in a quasi-historical way, elements of all\nthree approaches have characterised responses to\nHIV\/AIDS in a more complex and contradictory\nway than our simple periodisation would acknowl-\nedge. However we believe this crude evolutionary\naccount has analytical value. It enables us to map out\nhow dominant understandings of HIV\/AIDS-related\nbehaviour change have paid gradually increasing\nattention to the social determinants of individual\nbehaviour, with ever-widening attention to the role of\nthe \u2018\u2018social\u2019\u2019 in shaping the possibility of programme\nsuccess. We hope this special edition will stimulate\ndebate on the need to further widen and intensify this\n\u2018\u2018socialisation\u2019\u2019 of approaches to behaviour change.\nThere is an urgent need for a \u2018\u2018fourth generation\u2019\u2019 of\napproaches to HIV\/AIDS management which moves\nbeyond the narrow local community emphasis of\nmost existing community mobilisation approaches to\ntake account of the wider social contexts within which\ncommunity mobilisation is implemented, and how\nthese support or undermine the likelihood of health-\nenhancing behaviour change.\nFirst generation approaches: promoting HIV\nawareness\nTargeting the individual as locus of change, and\ninformed by traditional health psychology, first gen-\neration approaches to behaviour change took the\nform of traditional didactic health education seeking\nto provide individuals with information about HIV\/\nAIDS, how to avoid it, and how to respond once\ninfected. The crudest versions assumed that people\nengaged in health-damaging behaviours due to ignor-\nance, and would make rational choices to change such\nbehaviour once in possession of accurate factual\ninformation (Aggleton, Young, Moody, Kapila, &\nPye, 1992). More sophisticated approaches drew on\nsocial cognition models. These gave a more complex\nand elaborated account of how health-related beha-\nviours were driven by people\u2019s individual perceptions\nof the risks, costs and benefits of those behaviours\n(Rosenstock, Strecher, & Becker, 1994; Terry, Gallois,\n& McCamish, 1993).\nHowever, these individual-focused approaches\noften had disappointing outcomes, with studies\nincreasingly suggesting that information, or indivi-\ndual perceptions, were only a partial determinant of\nbehaviour change \u0001 a necessary rather than sufficient\ncondition (Aggleton, O\u2019Reilly, Slutkin, & Davies,\n1994). Furthermore, such programmes were criticised\nfor being imposed on target communities by outside\nhealth professionals who often had little understand-\nings of the realities and limitations of people\u2019s lives\n(Asthana & Oostvogels, 1996).\nIn a searing critique of individual-focused strate-\ngies, Waldo and Coates (2000) argued that health\npsychologists may have unwittingly played a role in\ndriving the HIV\/AIDS epidemic through suggesting\nAIDS could be tackled by targeting individuals,\ndrawing attention away from the wider social drivers\nof HIV\/AIDS related behaviours. These included\nfactors such as the special vulnerability of women\nand young people to HIV-infection in some contexts,\nAids Care 1571\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:3\n2 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nthe role of peer norms rather than individual choice in\nshaping behaviours, and the difficulties faced by poor\npeople and people in under-served rural areas in\naccessing effective care and treatment once infected.\nSecond generation approaches: peer education\nIn response to the perceived shortcomings of individual-\nfocused approaches, a second generation of responses\nhighlighted the strong influence of peer norms on sexual\nand health behaviours, arguing that it made more sense\nto target the peer group \u0001 rather than the individual \u0001\nas unit of change. Informed by an emphasis on the\nimpact of small-group interactions on behaviour (Kelly\net al., 1992), such approaches rested on three assump-\ntions. Firstly that similar others (\u2018\u2018peers\u2019\u2019) were best\nplaced to reach socially marginalised HIV\/AIDS vul-\nnerable groups who might be inaccessible to main-\nstream health professionals, or unwilling to heed their\nadvice. Secondly that people were more likely to change\ntheir behaviour if they saw that liked and trusted peers\nwere changing theirs (Dube &Wilson, 1999). The third\nassumption was that the simple provision of informa-\ntion was unlikely to change behaviour in the absence of\nthe \u2018\u2018empowerment\u2019\u2019 of \u2018\u2018at risk\u2019\u2019 group members to\nconvert information to action, through the acquisition\nof skills. Such skills included sexual negotiation, asser-\ntiveness, knowing where to find condoms and how to\nput them on, and so on. Peers were seen as the best\ncommunicators of knowledge and skills, given their\n\u2018\u2018insider\u2019\u2019 status within hard-to-reach groups. Pro-\ngrammes trained members of \u2018\u2018high-risk groups\u2019\u2019 in\nHIV\/AIDS-related information and skills, sending\nthem back to their communities to disseminate these.\nPeer approaches have had some successes, espe-\ncially in more affluent countries and contexts, where\ntarget groupings already had a high degree of free-\ndom over their behaviour (agency), were already\nlinked through pre-existing networks characterised\nby solidarity and a common identity (bonding social\ncapital) and were able to mobilise the support of\npowerful social groups (bridging social capital). One\nsuch group was gay men in the USA at the early\nstages of the epidemic (Kegeles, Hays, & Coates,\n1996; Kelly et al., 1992).\nHowever, in other contexts, peer education has\nbeen less successful (Kim & Free, 2009). In her study\nof a relatively well-funded, state-of-the-art pro-\ngramme with sex workers in a South African mining\ncommunity, Campbell (2003) argued that peer educa-\ntion success was undermined by four factors. The first\nwas low levels of perceived agency by sex workers,\nmarginalised by gender, poverty and stigmatised\noccupational status. With few previous opportunities\nto exercise control over their well-being, they had\nlittle faith in their ability to avoid HIV. The second\nwas a lack of solidarity amongst sex workers,\ncompeting for clients who paid more for unprotected\nsex. Dependent on these clients for survival, advice to\n\u2018\u2018use condoms\u2019\u2019 was not particularly useful. The third\nwas lack of bonding social capital \u0001 support from\nsignificant others in the communities where they lived\nand worked. Landladies encouraged them to drink\nheavily to create a convivial atmosphere that at-\ntracted clients, undermining condom use. Macho\nmale clients said condoms undermined the sexual\npleasure they paid for. The fourth undermining\nfactors was lack of support from regional health\nand welfare agencies (bridging social capital), who\nprovided minimal services which sex workers found\ndifficult to access.\nCritics of peer education fall into two groups\n(Cornish & Campbell, 2009). The first focuses on the\nmethods used by peer educators, arguing that whilst\npeers may be best placed to reach marginalised\ngroups, most programmes use outdated teaching\nmethods. These involve the linear transmission of\ninformation, where the peer educator plays the role of\nactive expert, passing information to a passive\naudience. Such critics argue that dialogical educa-\ntional approaches are more likely to lead to the\ndevelopment of the critical thinking, agency and\nsolidarity that have been absent in many peer\neducation settings. They are also more likely to\nenable participants to negotiate healthier behavioural\nstrategies that are realistic within the realities of their\neveryday lives. The second group of critics focus on\nthe contexts of peer education arguing that pro-\ngrammes need to be backed up by efforts to create\nhealth-enabling social environments. Many have\nargued that community mobilisation approaches\ncould address both of these criticisms, leading to\na growing emphasis on the \u2018\u2018third generation\u2019\u2019 of\napproaches.\nThird generation approaches: community mobilisation\nThe third generation of responses to HIV\/AIDS\nidentifies the locus of change more widely than peer\neducation, seeking to implement change at the level of\ncommunities, in order to create community contexts\nthat support the development of health-enhancing\npeer norms and individual behaviour change. Com-\nmunity mobilisation approaches seek to create and\nharness the agency of the marginalised groups most\nvulnerable to HIV\/AIDS, enabling them to build a\ncollective, community response, through their full\nparticipation in the design, implementation and\nleadership of health programmes, and by forging\nsupportive partnerships with significant groups both\n1572 C.

In so doing,\nthese approaches seek to tackle the criticisms of peer\neducation discussed above, through facilitating social\ncapital, dialogue and empowerment. We discuss each\nof these processes, viewing them as the pathways\nbetween participation and behaviour change, and the\nsocial psychological processes through which partici-\npation has its impact on health.\nSocial capital\nLimited access to social capital (defined as durable\nnetworks of socially advantageous inter-group rela-\ntionships) is a key factor in perpetuating poverty and\nother social disadvantages that prevent people from\ntaking control over their health and improving their\nlife circumstances (Bourdieu, 1986). Community\nmobilisation approaches assume that marginalised\ngroupings are most likely to change their behaviours\nif there is significant support for new behaviours,\nboth from other groups within the communities in\nwhich they are located (bonding social capital)\n(Skovdal, pp. 1652\u00011661), and from more powerful\nactors and agencies outside of the community, who\nhave the political and economic power to provide\nthem with meaningful support (bridging social capi-\ntal) (Cornish, pp. 1670\u00011678). A core goal of com-\nmunity mobilisation approaches is to facilitate such\nrelationships through community participation and\npartnership building.\nSocial spaces for critical dialogue\nElsewhere we have emphasised the need for projects\nto create \u2018\u2018transformative social spaces\u2019\u2019 in which\npeople are able to develop actionable understandings\nof how to improve their health (Campbell & Cornish,\n2010). At this stage of the epidemic, often even\nthe most marginalised have access to basic HIV\/\nAIDS information. What they lack are \u2018\u2018safe social\nspaces\u2019\u2019 where they can engage in dialogue and debate\nabout new information (Vaughan, 2010; Vaughan,\npp. 1644\u00011651). It is through such dialogue that\npeople are most likely to gradually take ownership of\ninitially unfamiliar and alien medical information,\nairing doubts or confusions, and working through\nways to incorporate new information into their\nexisting worldviews and practices. Such social spaces\nalso provide contexts where people can brainstorm\npotential behaviour changes that are realistic within\nthe constraints of their everyday lives. Ideally they\ncan also discuss ways in which they might challenge\nunhealthy social relations. Community mobilisation\nprogrammes need to facilitate the development of\nsuch spaces and such dialogue.\nEmpowerment\/agency\nPeer educational approaches typically define \u2018\u2018em-\npowerment\u2019\u2019 narrowly, focusing only on HIV\/AIDS-\nspecific skills such as negotiating condom use or\nprocuring condoms. Community mobilisation ap-\nproaches assume that people are most likely to feel\nempowered to take control over their health if they\nhave experiences of exercising agency in other areas\nof their lives (Wallerstein, 1992). In other words, they\nare more likely to feel empowered if they actually are\nempowered. Community mobilisation approaches to\nHIV\/AIDS seek to involve community members in\nefforts to bring about health-enhancing changes, such\nas persuading health services not to discriminate\nagainst PLHA, or pressurising the police not to abuse\ntheir powers against sex workers, for example. Such\nactions may have a positive impact on health both\ndirectly, by reducing some of the environmental risks\nwhich undermine health, and indirectly, through\nsupporting a feeling of empowerment which en-\ncourages subsequent individual and collective\nhealth-promoting action.\nArnstein\u2019s (1971) classic \u2018\u2018ladder of participation\u2019\u2019\nclassifies opportunities for community participation\nin health and social development projects on\na continuum. The one extreme of this continuum is\n\u2018\u2018weak\u2019\u2019 participation \u0001 referring to tokenistic forms\nof involvement where community members are in-\nvited to become involved in projects that are designed\nand managed by outsiders (usually health or social\ndevelopment professionals), with community mem-\nbers exerting little or no influence on the project\u2019s\nshape or in project decision-making. Many peer\neducation programmes would be classified as such.\nThe other extreme of this continuum is \u2018\u2018strong\u2019\u2019\nparticipation. Here projects may still initially be\nestablished and funded by outsiders, but they focus\nstrongly on building the capacity of marginalised\ncommunity members to eventually exercise leadership\nin every aspect of project design, budgeting, imple-\nmentation and decision-making. It is projects of the\nlatter kind that are said to provide the optimal\nopportunities for the health-related empowerment of\nparticipants.\nThrough these three means (building social capi-\ntal, dialogue, and empowerment), community mobi-\nlisation approaches seek to build a more sustainable\nand effective response to HIV\/AIDS than has been\nachieved through peer education or HIV awareness\nefforts. However, whilst there is general agreement\nthat strong community mobilisation can play a vital\nrole in enhancing responses to prevention, care and\ntreatment, the outcomes of efforts to facilitate\neffective mobilisation in health programmes are\nAids Care 1573\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:3\n2 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nmixed (Cornish & Campbell, 2009). Critics argue that\nmobilising communities to lead responses to HIV\/\nAIDS is a near impossible task, emphasising that\ndisadvantaged communities often lack both the\nmotivation to work together to improve health, and\nthe special skills needed to lead and maintain the\ndemanding work of health interventions (Watkins,\n2003). If communities had the capacity to mobilise to\nimprove health and self-empowerment, it is argued,\nthey would not still be in the disadvantaged and\nhealth-damaging conditions that health programmes\nseek to alleviate.\nRather than simply conceptualising communities\nas lacking the resources for community mobilisation,\nhowever, we argue that greater attention could be\ngiven to the contexts in which community mobilisa-\ntion efforts are initiated, and which shape their\nprospects for success or failure. This is the \u2018\u2018fourth\ngeneration\u2019\u2019 perspective the current special issue seeks\nto advance: a focus on the role of social environments\nin enabling or constraining effective community\nresponses to HIV\/AIDS. In order to start mapping\nout the dimensions of the social environment which\nshape programme success or failure, we discuss two\ncase studies of interventions located in very different\ncontexts.\nContexts of community mobilisation: two case studies\nThe Entabeni Project in South Africa, and the\nSonagachi Project in India, which we have compared\nelsewhere (Campbell & Cornish, 2010), are two HIV\/\nAIDS projects which fared very differently in their\naims to mobilise a sustainable community response,\nand which took place in sharply contrasting contexts.\nThe former sought to build the capacity of poor rural\nwomen to deliver effective home nursing to people\ndying of AIDS in an isolated rural community. The\nlatter sought to build the capacity of impoverished\nand excluded sex workers to take control over their\nsexual health in Kolkata, India. Both projects used\nthe method of promoting peer education amongst\npoor women as their starting points, but hoped that\nthis would form a basis for an effective community\nresponse to AIDS.\nBoth projects were very successful in building the\nskills and knowledge of women deeply marginalised\nby gender and poverty. In both cases, women were\nsuccessfully trained in peer education skills and\nworked hard and enthusiastically to promote effective\nHIV\/AIDS management in their particular commu-\nnities. However only the Sonagachi Project succeeded\nin building supportive social environments in which\nmore powerful outsiders were willing to support sex\nworkers in improving their health and well-being. The\nproject succeeded in mobilising the support of police,\npoliticians and journalists, all key constituencies who\nhad the power to support the sex workers\u2019 goals and\nadvance their interests in significant ways. These\nimproved relationships resulted in, for example: fewer\nviolent police raids and arrests of sex workers, legal\nchanges to allow sex workers to register their micro-\ncredit co-operative, a donation of municipal land for\na clinic, and positive media reports celebrating project\nsuccesses. This was not the case in Entabeni where the\nefforts of feisty and well trained women were\npersistently undermined by local community leaders,\nand by vitally important health and welfare officials\nin the public sector.\nIn Campbell and Cornish (2010), we tease out\nhow pre-existing social contexts impacted on the\npossibility of effective community mobilisation in\neach case, and highlighting the way in which the\nSonagachi Project managed to alter aspects of the\npreviously limiting symbolic, material and relational\ncontexts of project participants\u2019 lives in the lives of\nproject participants in ways that the Entabeni Project\ndid not.\nSymbolic context\nThe symbolic context comprises the meanings, ideol-\nogies and worldviews circulating in society. When\nthese meanings are about specific communities, they\nmay convey respect or stigma, which in turn affect\nhow those communities are treated by others, and\nhow they feel about themselves.\nThe Entabeni Project was unable to tackle three\nforms of stigma which undermined its efforts to\nmobilise an effective community response. Firstly\nthe stigmatisation of AIDS as immoral and shameful.\nSecondly the stigmatisation of caring for the sick,\ndismissed as \u2018\u2018women\u2019s work\u2019\u2019 holding little value for\nmen or young people, two groups the project had\nbeen keen to mobilise. Thirdly, the stigmatisation of\nvolunteer work, which was seen \u0001 again by men and\nyoung people \u0001 as holding little dignity. These forms\nof stigma undermined both the volunteers\u2019 motiva-\ntion and the likelihood that men, young people or\npotential external partners would take the project\nseriously and give it the necessary support. By\ncontrast, the Sonagachi Project managed to actively\nchallenge the stigmatisation of sex work and of HIV\/\nAIDS, previously a key obstacle to sex workers\u2019\nability to take control over their sexual health. It did\nthis by framing sex workers as successful and\nlegitimate workers, who needed to unite to secure\ntheir rights, just as other groups of workers (e.g.\ncobblers, rickshaw drivers) had done in Kolkata in\n1574 C.

HIV\/AIDS was framed as an occupational\nhealth issue, facing a group of workers with rights to\nsafe working conditions.\nThe Sonagachi Project\u2019s success in challenging\nstigma was facilitated by a very different pre-existing\npolitical context. West Bengal had a strong tradition\nof trade unionism and left-wing political parties, with\nwide familiarity with the concepts of solidarity,\ncollective bargaining and protest, all actively invoked\nby sex workers as they engaged in project activities.\nThere was no such history in isolated rural Entabeni,\nwhere a hereditary chief wielded absolute power,\nprohibiting any kind of political opposition in\na context very removed from any contact with South\nAfrica\u2019s anti-apartheid history. Unlike Sonagachi sex\nworkers, Entabeni home-based carers had no access\nto stories of disempowered women successfully fight-\ning for social recognition, and were pessimistic about\nthe possibility for democratic social change in their\ncommunity.\nMaterial context\nThe second dimension of context which the Sonaga-\nchi Project managed to tackle, but not Entabeni, was\nthe material context. Each project sought to support\nits participants to better cope with the crippling\npoverty that undermined their opportunities for\nwell-being. Sonagachi was able to contribute to\nparticipants\u2019 economic empowerment through pro-\nviding small payments to peer educators, giving their\nwork a formal value and freeing some of their paid\nsex work time to engage in project activities. By\ncontrast, despite three years of hard lobbying, the\nEntabeni Project had no success in securing promised\ngovernment stipends for its volunteers. The Sonaga-\nchi Project also succeeded in setting up valued and\neffective micro-credit and savings schemes for parti-\ncipants. Here again, the Entabeni Project had no\nsuccess. The lack of economic gain associated with\nproject involvement meant that it failed to resonate\nwith peoples\u2019 economic aspirations, severely limiting\nits ability to mobilise volunteers to carry out project\nwork, and undermining the status of the project in the\ncommunity.\nRelational context\nThe third dimension of context that the Sonagachi\nProject was able to change, and the Entabeni Project\nwas not, was the relational context of the project. In\nrelation to leadership and decision-making, Sonaga-\nchi succeeded in effecting the gradual involvement of\nwomen in organisational decision-making and leader-\nship. In contrast, Entabeni was unable to dislodge\nstrong local resistance to female leadership. Secondly,\nin relation to building \u2018\u2018bridging social capital\u2019\u2019\n(alliances with supportive outside groups), whilst\nEntabeni had some success with two small poorly\nfunded NGOs, it failed to build effective links with\npublic sector health and welfare agencies. Such links\nwould have been vital for project success because the\neffectiveness of home-based care is greatly enhanced\nif patients are able to access those formal health\nservices and welfare grants that exist, and if public\nsector services are tailored to community needs. The\nSonagachi Project, by contrast, was able to build\nstrong supportive relationships with outside actors\nand agencies, including politicians, police and jour-\nnalists (see Cornish, pp. 1670\u00011678).\nTowards supportive social environments for community\nmobilisation\nThese case studies suggest that the success or failure\nof these two community mobilisation interventions\nwere not only attributable to the efforts of the\nmarginalised women who mobilised a collective\ncommunity response, but were also profoundly\nshaped by the symbolic, material and relational\ncontexts within which the initiatives took place. To\ndate, little research effort has been directed at this\n\u2018\u2018fourth generation\u2019\u2019 area for analysis and action.\nWithout a sophisticated understanding of the impact\nof social context on community interventions, there is\na risk that the theoretically well-founded interest in\ncommunity mobilisation, among policymakers and\nprogramme implementers, will yield no fruits. If\ncommunity mobilisation is initiated in adverse social\nenvironments, and without the necessary concurrent\nefforts to create the conditions for its flourishing, it is\nlikely to suffer the same fate as its predecessors \u0001 peer\neducation and HIV awareness. It is in the interest of\ndeveloping this \u2018\u2018fourth generation\u2019\u2019 perspective, and\nthus maximising the chances of community mobilisa-\ntion achieving its potential that we have brought\ntogether the papers in this special issue.\nThe impact of social environments on community\nmobilisation initiatives: the current special issue\nThis special issue brings together 12 very different\npapers, united by their focus on the impacts of social\nenvironments on efforts to mobilise HIV\/AIDS-\nvulnerable communities. Each paper addresses one\nor more of the dimensions of context that we have\ndiscussed above. These are rich and nuanced papers,\nand our brief account of them picks out only very\npartial aspects of their complex set of findings.\nAids Care 1575\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nLo\nnd\non\n S\nch\noo\nl \nof\n E\nco\nno\nmi\ncs\n &\n P\nol\nit\nic\nal\n S\nci\nen\nce\n] \nAt\n: \n12\n:3\n2 \n16\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n11\nMaterial context\nThe international funding architecture comes under\nscrutiny in three papers as a key aspect of the material\ncontext that influences the shape of community\ninterventions. In a large-scale study of HIV\/AIDS\nfunding in east and southern Africa, Kelly and\nBirdsall document a recent exponential growth of\ncivil society organisations, in response to donor\npolicies which identify civil society as the best route\nto rapidly scaling up HIV\/AIDS interventions. They\nargue, however, that this funding environment may\nin fact undermine the special contribution of civil\nsociety \u0001 because in this system, civil society organi-\nsations have become mechanisms for the delivery of\nexternally designed services, not for community\nmobilisation.\nKelly and Birdsall\u2019s sweeping overview provides\nan important backdrop for two in-depth case studies\nby Aveling and Cassidy, which examine the impact\nof international funding practices on community\nHIV prevention projects with military families in\nCambodia, and support groups for people with AIDS\nin Gambia, respectively. What Aveling refers to as\n\u2018\u2018aid chains\u2019\u2019 construct complex social spaces in which\nlocal people (\u2018\u2018beneficiaries\u2019\u2019), organisations running\ninterventions, and international donors are brought\ntogether, with often unexpected and contradictory\nresults. Her Cambodian research shows how the\npartnerships characterising the \u2018\u2018aid chain\u2019\u2019 both\nenable local-level empowerment by serving as\na conduit for useful resources, and undermine such\nempowerment by strictly controlling the parameters\nof interventions. Countering any temptation to car-\nicature aid relationships in terms of one-dimensional\nstereotypes of powerful funders and powerless poor\ncommunities, Cassidy\u2019s Gambian study highlights\nhow desperately poor people living with HIV\/AIDS\njuggle their loyalties to competing international\/\nbiomedical and local\/traditional AIDS initiatives in\ntheir efforts to gain a complex and contradictory\narray of rewards and benefits as they struggle to stay\nalive in conditions of severe marginalisation and\npowerlessness.\nThe institutional constraints of a government\npublic health system comprise the material context\naddressed in Scott\u2019s study of a community health\nworker initiative in rural northern India. The com-\nmendable intention to mobilise local women to\npromote their peers\u2019 reproductive health, Scott\nargues, was not backed up by an appropriate system\nof remuneration for the community health workers,\nproperly resourced clinics, or genuine devolution of\npower. Her study suggests that the strongly hierarch-\nical and centralised nature of traditional public health\nservices is diametrically opposed to the participatory\nethos of community mobilisation.\nSymbolic context\nThree papers, focusing on symbolic context, highlight\ndifficulties faced by community interventions when\ndominant understandings of HIV\/AIDS are at odds\nwith community understandings and interests. In\na paper addressing the challenge of implementing\n\u2018\u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019\u2019 in southern Africa, Mannell\nfurther develops the theme of global-local relations in\nher study of the differing understandings of \u2018\u2018gender\u2019\u2019\nheld by internationally funded HIV\/AIDS pro-\ngrammes, and by local communities. She argues\nthat one reason for the much-lamented failure of\nmany gender mainstreaming efforts is that foreign\ndonors impose an inappropriate western and neo-\nliberal understanding of gender onto African\ncommunities.\nThe mass media play an important role in shaping\npublic understandings of HIV\/AIDS and appropriate\ninterventions, including the understandings held by\npolicymakers and programme implementers. Gibbs\nexamines how the South African print media repre-\nsent the gendered nature of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic,\nand potential solutions. While newspapers generally\nrecognise the powerful social forces undermining\nwomen\u2019s abilities to protect their health, they give\nlittle attention to the role of grassroots women\u2019s\ncommunity mobilisation. Gibbs calls for greater\nunderstandings of the role of community mobilisa-\ntion, not only in the academic literature, but also in\npublic understandings.\nSymbolically marginalised and stigmatised social\ngroups are often particularly vulnerable to HIV\/\nAIDS, and challenging that stigma is a crucial early\nstep in mobilising a community and establishing their\nlocal legitimacy. Blankenship, Biradavolu, Jenna and\nGeorge provide a case study of an occasion in which\na community-led intervention for sex workers in\nsouthern India joined forces with a government-\nsponsored HIV awareness initiative. In part, the\ncollaboration made sex workers complicit in their\nown stigmatisation, due to the conservatively framed\nmessages of the campaign, but it also provided\nopportunities to challenge that stigma. The study\nindicates the limits and possibilities of community-led\nefforts to alter their symbolic context.\nRelational context\nFive papers focus on the relational contexts of\nprogrammes through their accounts of the challenges\nof getting key partners to support AIDS projects.\n1576 C.

The\ngoals of empowering women and youth through their\nparticipation in an HIV\/AIDS programme were at\nvariance with the goals of the area\u2019s traditional\nleader, who derived his political power from his role\nas \u2018\u2018guardian of tradition\u2019\u2019, involving the very gender\nand age hierarchies that have advanced the epide-\nmic and undermined local people\u2019s ability to respond\neffectively.\nSimilar challenges are taken up by Vaughan, in\nresearch into HIV prevention among youth in Papua\nNew Guinea. Vaughan draws attention to the gaps\nbetween young people and donors, and young\npeople and local leaders, articulating how these\nundermine HIV prevention efforts. She provides an\nexemplar, through a Photovoice project, of how\n\u2018\u2018in-between social spaces\u2019\u2019 may be created, to enable\nfruitful dialogue between influential adults and young\npeople, for the advancement of young people\u2019s\nhealth.\nA cash transfer project for young carers in Kenya,\nreported by Skovdal, also provided a helpful space\nfor young people to develop supportive social rela-\ntions with each other, resulting in the young people\nhelping each other in ways that generalised beyond\nthe project. In conditions of desperate poverty,\nhowever, the project battled with\u2019free riders\u2019 not\ntaking their share of responsibility and people not\nbeing trustworthy with the group\u2019s money. Unpro-\nmising wider community relationships are also the\nconcern of Nhamo, Campbell and Gregson, in a\nstudy of a rural Zimbabwean community. The efforts\nof an HIV prevention programme were undermined\nby a deeply rooted traditionalism, characterised by\nhierarchical social relations, social divisions and a\nmoralistic response to HIV\/AIDS, combined with\nalienating prior experiences of the provision of\ndevelopment aid and public services.\nIn contrast, using case studies of two communities\nwhere social relations were more enabling of partici-\npatory HIV\/AIDS interventions, Cornish, Shukla\nand Banerji investigate Indian sex worker organisa-\ntions\u2019 relatively successful efforts to improve their\nrelationships with local powerful actors (including\npolice and politicians) whose actions impact on sex\nworkers\u2019 abilities to protect their health. They argue\nthat these efforts take the form of \u2018\u2018exchanging\nfavours\u2019\u2019 in which the sex workers\u2019 organisations\nfind incentives to offer to the powerful in exchange\nfor their support \u0001 an approach which is potentially\nproductive yet also risky.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have articulated the rationale for\ncommunity mobilisation approaches to HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement, contextualised by our account of three\ndominant approaches to behaviour change. These\nrange on a continuum from more individual-focused\napproaches, such as HIV awareness, to peer-based\napproaches, to more socially sensitive approaches,\nsuch as community mobilisation. We have sought to\nmake the case for the development of a fourth, even\nmore social approach \u0001 which takes account of how\nwider social contexts facilitate or hinder community\nmobilisation approaches.\nThis special issue takes a first step in elaborating\nthis \u2018\u2018fourth generation\u2019\u2019 perspective, bringing to-\ngether papers which provide evidence and argument\nfor the role of social context in shaping community\nmobilisation interventions in a range of case studies.\nCollectively, the papers present a picture of signifi-\ncant contextual barriers to successful, empowering\ncommunity mobilisation. They document how the\nexisting material, symbolic, and relational contexts of\nHIV\/AIDS-vulnerable communities often create near\nimpossible conditions for the development of locally\nsensitive, flexible, empowering and sustainable com-\nmunity mobilisation. As such, this first step, we\nbelieve, confirms that the wider social context of\ninterventions deserves our attention. At the same\ntime, however, the implications of this first step\nappear discouraging. One interpretation might be\nthat community mobilisation is not worth attempting\nif it is so often fatally undermined by the stark\nrealities of divisive and disempowering social envir-\nonments.\nAn alternative response is possible. We stand by\nour arguments for the importance of community\nmobilisation in generating a sustainable local re-\nsponse to HIV\/AIDS, through developing social\ncapital, dialogue and empowerment. Rather than\ndismissing the potential of community mobilisation,\nwe suggest turning attention to the question of how\nsocial environments can be changed or created so as\nto maximally support community mobilisation ef-\nforts. Social environments are not fixed, but are often\na product of the actions of powerful decision-makers\nsuch as donors, government agencies and politicians.\nThe question, thus, for this \u2018\u2018fourth generation\u2019\u2019\nperspective becomes a question of political will. To\nprepare the ground for successful community mobi-\nlisation initiatives, it is not enough to prepare local\nvolunteers with the skills to run an intervention\ntogether. Mobilising political will to create supportive\nconditions for community action, at local, national,\nand international levels is also required.

In\nwhat follows, we indicate some possible directions.\nDonors, development agencies, and government\nagencies need to consider how their policies\nand actions create the environment in which commu-\nnity programmes operate. Pre-defined project plans,\nreporting procedures requiring advanced bureau-\ncratic expertise, short-term funding cycles, a lack of\nresponsiveness to local diversity and priorities, stig-\nmatising definitions of problems, and strongly hier-\narchical relationships all undermine community\nmobilisation \u0001 but also can all be altered. If the\nmany organisations writing and endorsing HIV\/AIDS\npolicies which prioritise community approaches are\nserious about this goal, they should consider whether\ntheir structures are sufficiently tolerant of local\ndiversity and supportive of local empowerment.\nAcademic research constitutes part of the sym-\nbolic environment of community mobilisation initia-\ntives. Academic discussions play a large role in the\ncreation of concepts such as \u2018\u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019\u2019,\n\u2018\u2018vectors of HIV\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018empowerment\u2019\u2019 and even \u2018\u2018com-\nmunity mobilization\u2019\u2019 \u0001 concepts which in turn\ninform and shape policy and practice. To help create\noptimal conditions for successful community mobili-\nsation, researchers could shift attention \u2018\u2018upwards\u2019\u2019 to\nthe behaviour of the powerful, rather than continuing\nto focus \u2018\u2018downwards\u2019\u2019 on the behaviour of margin-\nalised communities. We hope that this special issue\nhas taken a first step towards promoting academic\ndebate on the significance of social environments in\nshaping community interventions, and that it might\nspark attention to what we see as the second step,\nnamely the question of how to mobilise the necessary\npolitical will to give community mobilisation a real\nchance of success.\nReferences\nAggleton, P., O\u2019Reilly, K.R., Slutkin, G., & Davies, P.\n(1994).
