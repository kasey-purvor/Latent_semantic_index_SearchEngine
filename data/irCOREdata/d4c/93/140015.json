Soil\nerosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration and landscape biodiversity were\nchosen as indicators to assess a stratified random sample of 19 landscape test\nsites in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of Europe. At each site, the\neffect of introducing agroforestry was examined at plot-scale by simulating the\ngrowth of one of five tree species (hybrid walnut Juglans spp., wild cherry\nPrunus avium L., poplar Populus spp., holm oak Quercus ilex L. subsp. ilex and\nstone pine Pinus pinea L.) at two tree densities (50 and 113 trees ha\u22121) in\ncombination with up to five crops (wheat Triticum spp., sunflower Helianthus\nannuus L., oilseed rape Brassica napus L., grain maize and silage maize Zea mays\nL.). At landscape-scale, the effect of introducing agroforestry on 10 or 50% of\nthe agricultural area, on either the best or worst quality land, was examined.\nAcross the 19 landscape test sites, SAF had a positive impact on the four\nindicators with the strongest effects when introduced on the best quality land.\nThe computer simulations showed that SAF could significantly reduce erosion by\nup to 65% when combined with contouring practices at medium (>0.5 and <3 t ha\u22121\na\u22121) and high (>3 t ha\u22121 a\u22121) erosion sites. Nitrogen leaching could be reduced\nby up to 28% in areas where leaching is currently estimated high (>100 kg N h\u22121\na\u22121), but this was dependent on tree density. With agroforestry, predicted mean\ncarbon sequestration through immobilization in trees, over a 60-year period,\nranged from 0.1 to 3.0 t C h\u22121 a\u22121 (5\u2013179 t C h\u22121) depending on tree species and\nlocation.

This \nhas been a major result of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union \n(EU) and has successfully provided consumers with an abundant supply of agricultural \nproducts, whilst simultaneously the proportion of household income expended on food has \ndeclined (Gr\u00fcbler, 1994). \nIncreased agricultural output per unit of area and per unit of labor has been achieved \nusing improved genetic material, increased inputs, and modern management techniques, for \nexample new crop varieties, the use of fertilizer and other agrochemicals, and large-scale \nspecialized machinery. These practices were implemented together with land consolidation \nprograms to increase the size of agricultural parcels. To some extent, however, the gains in \nefficiency of production were achieved at the expense of the environment. In many places, \nsemi-natural and natural habitats were removed, resulting in reduced farmland biodiversity. \nSoil erosion and compaction and the pollution of ground- and surface water with nitrates and \npesticides are other undesirable consequences of modern, intensified agricultural production \n(Bouma et al., 1998, Mermut & Eswaran, 2001). \nAgroforestry is a form of multi-cropping which involves combining at least one \nwoody-perennial species with a crop which results in ecological and economic interactions \nbetween the two components.  Such systems are typically associated with a variety of \nenvironmental benefits and although agroforestry systems were common in Europe (Olea & \nFiguera, 1999, Eichhorn et al., 2005) they have strongly declined because of agricultural \nintensification (Dupraz & Newman, 1997, Herzog, 1998).  \nIn Europe, environmental benefits are expected from new land-use systems (Baldock \net al., 1993). Since the 1990\u2019s, research projects have demonstrated that novel temperate \nagroforestry systems can operate with modern technology whilst preserving some of the \nenvironmental benefits associated with traditional agroforestry (Auclair & Dupraz, 1998).  \nOne form of agroforestry, here referred to as silvoarable agroforestry (SAF), is the practice of \ngrowing an arable crop between spatially-zoned trees in rows (Dupraz & Newman, 1997, \nBurgess et al., 2004b).  However, investigating the environmental performance of SAF \nthrough field experiments is expensive and time-consuming because trees take decades to \nmature and as a consequence, the initiation of such experiments is difficult (Poulton, 1995). \nComputer models provide one method for overcoming these problems. They can extrapolate \nresearch results to new combinations of biophysical and management conditions that are too \ncomplex to be studied in field experiments (Mobbs et al., 2001).  \nA modeling approach was developed by Palma et al. (2006) to assess the \nenvironmental performance of SAF systems. It comprised examining the impact of SAF on \nsoil erosion by water (hereafter called erosion), nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration and \nlandscape biodiversity, and uses tree and crop yields derived from a biophysical model called \nYield-SAFE (from \u201cYIeld Estimator for Long term Design of Silvoarable AgroForestry in \nEurope\u201d). Yield-SAFE was developed with as few equations and parameters as possible to \nallow model parameterization under constrained availability of data from long term \nexperiments (van der Werf et al., 2006).   \nThe objective of this paper is to assess the potential environmental performance of \nSAF in representative climatic conditions of southern Europe (Mediterranean Spain), western \nEurope (France), and northern Europe (the Netherlands) at the scale of farms \/ small \nlandscapes using models and algorithms of appropriate spatial and thematic resolution and \ncomplexity (Palma et al., 2006).  \n 3\n2 Material and methods \nRandomly selected landscape test sites (LTS) in Spain, France and the Netherlands \nwere used to model tree and crop yields on hypothetical farms for SAF at two densities (50 \nand 113 trees ha-1, 40 x 5m and 22 x 4m respectively) on 10 and 50% of the total agricultural \narea, starting with either the best and worst quality land. Current agricultural land use was \nalso modeled to provide a comparison with the status quo. Yield-SAFE (van der Werf et al., \n2006) was used to generate crop yields for typical crop rotations (combinations with up to \nfive crops; wheat Triticum spp., sunflower Helianthus annuus L., oilseed rape Brassica napus \nL., grain maize and silage maize Zea mays L.) at each LTS over a 60-year time horizon. The \nsame crop rotations were then incorporated in SAF systems that included holm oak (Quercus \nilex subsp. ilex L.) and stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) in Spain, hybrid walnut (Juglans sp), wild \ncherry (Prunus avium L.) and poplar (Populus spp) in France and the Netherlands. An initial \nstage of the investigation involved characterizing the LTS to provide inputs for the Yield-\nSAFE model and environmental assessment algorithms.  \n2.1 Data acquisition and processing \nBased on an environmental classification of Europe, which resulted from a statistical \nanalysis of climatic and topographic data (Metzger et al., 2005), 21 LTS of 4 km x 4 km each \nwere selected in the dominant environmental classes of Spain (9), France (9) and The \nNetherlands (3). The selection was random, but was restricted to agricultural areas according \nto the PELCOM land cover classification (M\u00fccher, 2000). Two LTS in France were later \ndiscarded due to lack of associated data, bringing the total to 19 LTS. In Spain the sites \nranged from Alcala la Real in Andalucia in the south to St Maria del Paramo in Castilla y \nLeon in the north.  In France, the sites ran across central France from Champdeniers in Poitou \nCharentes in the west to Champlitte in Franche Comt\u00e9 in the east. In the Netherlands the sites \nwere located in the central (Gelderland) and eastern (Overijssel) parts of the country (Error! \nReference source not found.).  \nIn Spain, aerial ortho-images were obtained from the SIG Ole\u00edcola Espa\u00f1ol (MAPYA, \n1999) and digital land-use data were obtained from  the REDPARES project (Bola\u00f1os et al., \n2003).  During field surveys, land use was updated and soil samples were taken to produce \nsoil maps in combination with topographic details. Digital elevation models (DEM) were \ndeveloped by digitizing the contour lines of topographic maps. In France, aerial photographs \nand DEM were acquired from IGN\u00a9, and the land-use digitized. Digital soil maps were \nacquired from various regional institutions. In the Netherlands, aerial photographs and land-\nuse data were obtained from the EU GREENVEINS project consortium (Bugter et al., 2001). \nDigital elevation models were acquired from DLG\u00a9 and digital soil maps from GeoDesk\u00a9. \nFor each LTS, daily and monthly weather data (temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) \nwere generated using Cligen 5.2 (Lane & Nearing, 1995)  based on reference data from the \nweather station nearest to the LTS (GDS, 2005). All spatial information was stored and \nprocessed in geographic information systems (ArcGIS \u2013 ArcInfo\u00a9 and ArcInfo WorkStation\u00a9 \n8.3). \nData on temperature, radiation, precipitation and soil water availability are required to \ngenerate tree and crop yields in Yield-SAFE. Precipitation and temperature were considered \nto be homogenous within each LTS, while solar radiation was considered to vary depending \non the direction and angle of the slopes described by the DEM. A solar radiation grid was \ncalculated for one year and each LTS with DiGEM (Conrad, 1998) and transformed into a \npercentage by dividing the radiation in each grid cell by the radiation obtained in a flat, un-\n 4\nshaded grid cell. From the soil information, available water content was estimated based on \nsoil depth and texture to which were associated \u201cvan Genuchten\u201d parameters assessed by \nW\u00f6sten et al. (1999) and volumetric water content calculated with the van Genuchten \nequation (1980). \n \n \nFig 1. Landscape test sites selected  covering wide biophysical characteristics based on the European \nenvironmental classification (Metzger et al., 2005). See Table 1 for the site codes. \n \n \n \n 5\nTo account for spatial variability in solar radiation and available soil water content \nwithin each LTS, both maps were processed using the isocluster analysis function in ArcInfo\u00a9 \n8.3  (Ball & Hall, 1965, Richards, 1986) resulting in up to four clusters or land units (LU). \nEach LU was then characterized by its mean radiation and its major soil texture and soil depth \n(Fig 1). The cluster analysis resulted in 42 LU for the 19 LTS, each potentially producing \ndifferent tree and crop yields (Table 1). All analyses, except that for landscape biodiversity, \nwere restricted to agricultural land within LU, since this land was considered to be the target \narea for SAF. Within each LTS, LU\u2019s were ranked according to their potential productivity. \nWhen more than 2 LU\u2019s were present, an intermediate quality was also given (medium). Crop \nrotations and agroforestry tree species were determined for each LU in workshops with \nexperts and local stakeholders (Table 1).  \nHypothetical farms were also devised for each LTS, using farm structure data from \nFADN (EC, 2003) and local statistics to define the total size of the farm. The area of each LU \nwithin each hypothetical farm was derived from the proportion of each LU within each LTS \n(Fig 1).  \n \n \nFig 1: GIS landscape data processing for each landscape test site (LTS) to create homogeneous land units (LU), \ncorresponding to different qualities of agricultural land of a farm (Torrijos LTS example). \n \n 6\nTable 1: Biophysical and management characteristics of the landscape test sites in Spain, France and the \nNetherlands and corresponding land units (LU).  \nSite Site Code \nAltitude\n(m) \nMean \nTemp \n(\u00b0) \nArea of\nfarm  \n(ha) \nRainfall \n(mm) \nLU \u2013 \nquality \nArea of \nLU (ha)\nRadiation\n(%) \nSoil \ntexture\n(FAO)\nSoil \ndepth \n(cm) \nTree Crop rotation \nSpain             \nLU1-B 58 97 M 140 Oak w\/w\/f Alcala la Real ALC 1000 15 73 355 LU2-W 15 86 M 50 Oak w\/w\/f \nLU1-W 10 101 M 140 Oak w\/f Torrijos TOR 500 15 63 348 LU2-B 56 100 M 140 Oak w\/w\/f \nOca\u00f1a OCA 700 15 66 316 LU1-na 66 100 M 140 Oak w\/w\/f \nLU1-B 59 97 M 140 Oak w\/f Almonacid de \nZorita ALM 900 13 66 404 LU2-W 7 83 F 140 Oak s\/s\/s\/s\/s\/w\/f \nLU1-W 23 93 M 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/f Cardenosa El \nEspinar CAR 1000 12 58 404 LU2-B 35 101 F 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/f \nLU1-B 49 99 C 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/w\/f Fontiveros FON 900 12 58 393 LU2-W 9 98 C 140 Pine w\/w\/w\/w\/f \nLU1-M 5 100 C 140 Pine w\/s\/f \nLU2-B 34 100 M 140 Oak w\/s\/f Olmedo OLM 750 12 57 410 \nLU3-W 18 99 C 140 Oak w\/s\/f \nLU1-W 44 99 C 140 Pine w\/w\/w\/f St Maria del \nCampo CAM 800 10 58 530 LU2-B 14 99 M 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/w\/w\/f\nLU1-B 4 100 M 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/s\/f \nLU2-M 34 100 M 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/s\/f St Maria del Paramo PAR 800 10 59 519 LU3-W 21 101 M 140 Oak w\/w\/w\/s\/f \nFrance             \nLU1-B 67 100 F 80 Cherry w\/w\/s\/w\/o\/s Champdeniers CHD 200 11 94 648 LU2-W 27 100 M 120 Walnut w\/w\/s\/w\/o\/s \nLU1-M 32 102 F 80 Walnut w\/w\/o\/w\/o\/s \nLU2-B 23 102 F 40 Cherry w\/w\/o\/w\/o\/s \nLU3-M 86 102 M 120 Walnut w\/w\/o \nChateauroux CHT 150 11 152 587 \nLU4-W 11 100 F 40 Cherry w\/w\/o\/w\/o\/s \nLU1-W 10 101 F 40 Cherry w\/o \nLU2-B 43 103 M 80 Poplar w\/w\/o Fussy FUS 200 10 80 626 \nLU3-M 27 102 F 120 Cherry w\/o \nLU1-M 37 103 F 40 Cherry o\/w\/s\/w\/w\/w\/o\nLU2-W 10 102 VF 140 Poplar o\/w\/s\/w\/w\/w\/o\nLU3-B 44 101 VF 120 Cherry o\/w\/s\/w\/w\/w\/o\nSancerre SAN 400 11 98 724 \nLU4-B 7 100 C 80 Cherry o\/w\/s\/w \nLU1-W 68 103 M 140 Cherry w\/w\/o Champlitte CMP 300 8 130 773 \nLU2-B 62 103 MF 35 Walnut w\/w\/w\/w\/w\/gm\nLU1-M 64 98 M 140 Cherry w\/w\/gm \nLU2-W 43 97 F 35 Cherry w\/w\/w\/gm Dampierre DAM 300 10 130 1072 \nLU3-B 23 95 MF 60 Poplar w\/gm \nLU1-W 46 103 M 60 Cherry w\/w\/o Vitrey VIT 400 9 120 1084 \nLU2-B 74 103 MF 60 Poplar w\/w\/gm \nThe Netherlands           \nBalkbrugg BAL 0 9 40 818 LU1-na 40 100 C 140 Poplar sm \nBentelo BEN 0 9 40 729 LU1-na 40 100 C 140 Walnut w\/w\/sm \nScherpenzeel SCH 0 9 10 801 LU1-na 10 100 C 140 Poplar sm \nLand Units (LU): B, best; M, medium; W, worst; na, not applicable.

(2004a) to predict annual tree and crop yields.   \nThe parameters used in Yield-SAFE to describe the growth of each tree and crop \nspecies were determined from published material (e.g yield tables) and calibrations. An initial \ncalibration for \u201cpotential\u201d monoculture yields (van Ittersum & Rabbinge, 1997) was \nundertaken against datasets of tree volume and crop yields under high yielding conditions in \nthe Atlantic and Mediterranean zones, assuming that light and temperature but not water, \nlimited growth (Burgess et al., 2004a). Then at each LU and assuming light, temperature, and \nwater limited growth within the model, the values of three parameters (harvest index, water \nuse efficiency and a management factor) were adjusted within acceptable boundaries so that \nthe output from the model over the duration of the tree component matched an \u201cactual\u201d \nmonoculture tree and crop yield (van Ittersum & Rabbinge, 1997).  The tree and crop \nmanagement defined previously for the monocultures and \u201creference\u201d soil depth and texture \nwere also used.  The monoculture management and actual and reference values were \ndetermined for each LTS during workshops held in each country (Herzog et al., 2004, Palma \n& Reisner, 2004, Reisner, 2004). \nIn Spain, the actual timber volumes for oak and stone pine in all the LTS in year 60 \nwere assumed to be 0.22 m3 and 0.26 m3 tree-1 respectively, indicating slow growth. In \nFrance, wild cherry (1.04-1.06 m3 tree-1) and walnut (1.04 m3 tree-1) for the same rotation \nwere comparatively fast-growing trees. Poplar was the fastest growing tree with actual yields \nof 1.46-1.51 m3 tree-1 after 20 years. In Spain, actual yields for (non-irrigated) wheat were \ncomparatively low (1.62-3.71 t ha-1) compared to those in France (6.5-8.0 t ha-1) and the \nNetherlands (7.8 t ha-1). Actual sunflower yields were lower in Spain (0.60-1.09 t ha-1) than in \nFrance (2.3-2.5 t ha-1). Actual yields for oilseed (3.2-4.0 t ha-1) and grain maize (7.5-8.0 t ha-1) \nwere assumed only for France and an actual yield for fodder maize (12 t ha-1) assumed only \nfor the Netherlands. \n2.3 Data analysis \nThe environmental assessment was performed in each LU assuming a 60-year rotation \nfor the agroforestry system. For poplar, which was assumed to have a rotation of 20 years, \nthree successive tree crops were included. Because crop yields within an agroforestry system \ndecline over time as the trees increase in size and compete with the crops, it was assumed that \nfarmers would stop arable cropping when it became unprofitable. The cut-off point was \nestimated from a five-year moving average of profitability as described by Graves et al. \n(2006).   \nFor each scenario, soil erosion, nitrogen leaching, carbon sequestration and landscape \nbiodiversity were examined using the method described by Palma et al. (2006). Erosion was \nmodeled with the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE, Renard et al., 1997), where \nSAF was considered to mimic strip cropping, which could be implemented with or without an \nerosion control measure, in this case contouring. Nitrogen leaching was modeled using an \nequation proposed by Feldwisch et al. (1998), which uses an annual water exchange factor in \nthe soil and the excess nitrogen potentially available for leaching. Annual excess nitrogen was \nestimated from tree and crop productivity, assuming optimized nitrogen fertilization, taking \ninto account nitrogen contents of crop-tree biomass, of the soil and the nitrogen recovery \ncapacity by crops (van Keulen, 1982). Crop and tree yields were computed by Graves et al. \n(2006) and van der Werf et al. (2006) for each LU using Yield-SAFE. The model also \n 8\nprovided an estimation for groundwater recharge required to compute annual nitrogen \nleaching. Carbon sequestration was calculated for SAF systems only, based on the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1996) and Gifford relationships (2000a, \n2000b) for tree biomass predicted by the Yield-SAFE model.  A broad evaluation of the \neffects of SAF implementation on landscape biodiversity was conducted, based on the share \nof habitats available to wildlife in an agricultural landscape, classifying each LTS into \n\u201chabitat\u201d (e.g. hedgerows, permanent grassland, traditional orchards) and \u201cnon-habitat\u201d (the \narable matrix). \nEach environmental assessment for each LU in each LTS was then used to calculate a \nweighted mean at the farm scale, based on the proportion of land occupied by each LU within \neach LTS representing a hypothetical farm. These were then aggregated to provide an overall \nassessment of environmental effect for each scenario at each LTS \/ farm.  \nModeled results are representations of reality that can be statistically compared \n(Kleijnen, 1987). LU and LTS scale results were compared with general linear models (GLM) \nin STATISTICA\u00a9.  Multiple comparisons between scenarios were tested with Tukey HSD \n(Honest Significant Difference). \n3 Results and discussion \nThe resulting environmental assessments for each scenario in each LTS are \nsummarized in Table 2. Although the results are presented as mean annual values to facilitate \ninterpretation, the annual rates are not constant over the 60 years time horizon because of \nvariation in weather, crop rotations, and the growth of trees in the SAF systems. For example, \nin SAF systems, soil erosion was greatly reduced when a grass fallow was introduced at the \ntermination of profitable cropping, since such cover is an effective means of preventing soil \nloss (Morgan, 1995, Reisner & Freyer, 2005).  Similarly, nitrogen leaching is reduced \n(Whitehead, 1995). An example of the annual variability in nitrogen leaching is shown for a \nwalnut SAF system for the LTS at Champdeniers in France (Fig 2). \nIn interpreting the results, we focused on the relative differences between scenarios, \nrather than on the absolute values. However, absolute values have been tabulated to indicate \nthe order of magnitude of the computed values. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56\nNi\ntro\nge\nn \nle\nac\nhi\nng\n (k\ng \nha\n-1\n)\nArable SAF50 SAF113\n \nFig 2: Predicted annual nitrate leaching at land unit scale in the Chateauroux landscape test site over a 60-year \nperiod with walnut and a wheat-wheat-oilseed rotation.

See Table 1 for landscape test sites codes. \n 11\n3.1 Erosion \nPredicted erosion rates at the 19 LTS for the status quo arable systems ranged from 0 \nto 9.7 t ha-1 a-1 (Table 2). These are of a similar magnitude than those indicated in the \nEuropean soil erosion map for individual LTS locations (van der Knijff et al., 2000). \nAlthough absolute values from an empirical model that has not been locally calibrated should \nbe interpreted with caution (Centeri, 2003), the outputs from RUSLE can still be indicative of \nrelative differences in soil erosion between alternative land-use types (van Remortel et al., \n2001). \nIntroduction of SAF reduced erosion at all LTS in comparison with the arable status \nquo, especially when contouring was practiced (Table 2). To test significance, we grouped the \nLU and LTS into categories of low (< 0.5 t ha-1 a-1), medium (0.5 - 3 t ha-1 a-1) and high (> 3 t \nha-1 a-1) erosion sites (Table 3). Contouring is an important erosion control measure. However, \nthe implementation of contouring alone did not significantly reduce erosion, nor did the \nimplementation of SAF alone. Only when both measures were combined, statistical analysis \nsuggests significant reductions in erosion at medium (0.5 - 3 t ha-1 a-1) and high (> 3 t ha-1 a-1) \nerosion sites. Results at the LU scale suggest that on medium erosion sites, combining SAF \nand contouring could significantly reduce erosion by up to 80% (from 1.6 to 0.3 t ha-1 a-1) for \nboth tree densities and land types studied (Table 3a). Approximately the same order of \nmagnitude of reduction was calculated for the high erosion sites for both tree densities, but the \neffect was only significant (p<0.05) on the best quality land.  \nWhen LU-scale results were aggregated to the farm-scale, the only significant \nreduction occurred at medium erosion sites, where soil erosion was reduced by up to 65% \nwhen SAF was combined with contouring over 50% of the farm, on the best quality land, and \nat both 50 and 113 trees ha-1 (Table 3b). A similar effect was expected at high erosion sites.  \nHowever, the number of samples (n = 4) and the high variability of the results (between 3.4 \nand 9.7 t ha-1 a-1) prevented the results from being statistically significant. Similar relative \nreductions in erosion rates have been found after the introduction of hedgerow intercropping, \nwhere soil erosion was reduced by up to 90% on gentle slopes in Nigeria, and by 45-65% on \nsteep slopes in maize systems in Colombia (Young, 1989). \nRUSLE does not account for gully erosion. In fact, implementing SAF without \ncontouring could increase the probability of gully erosion along the tree strips, due to the \ngreater erosivity of water drops under the tree canopy (Young, 1989, McDonald et al., 2003), \nreducing or negating any positive impact of SAF systems on soil erosion. Nevertheless, the \norientation of tree lines along the contour level would avoid this negative impact (Seobi et al., \n2005). An aspect, which we did not investigate, is the risk of land slide processes, particularly \nimportant in slopes with soils consisting of layered clays. Although not modeled, the presence \nof trees in such areas could lower the risk of land sliding (Sidle et al., 2006).  \n \n 12\nTable 3: Effect on average soil loss (t ha-1 a-1) of non-contour and contouring practices with arable cropping, and \nsilvoarable agroforestry with 50 trees ha-1 (SAF50)  and 113 trees ha-1 (SAF113), for low, medium, and high \nerosion sites on a) the best and worst quality land at plot (land unit) scale and b)on 10 and 50% of the worst or \nbest quality land at the farm (landscape test site) scale.  \na) Land unit scale    Low                 \n(<0.5 t ha-1) \n  Medium   High                \n(> 3 t ha-1) \n     Worst Best  Worst Best  Worst Best \nNon- contouring Arable  0.4 0.3  1.5b 1.6b  5.8ab 7.0b \n SAF50  0.3 0.3  1.2ab 1.3ab  5.2ab 4.2ab \n  SAF113  0.3 0.3  1.1ab 1.1ab  4.7ab 3.8ab \nContouring Arable  0.1 0.2  0.9ab 0.9ab  3.8ab 4.5ab \n SAF50  0.1 0.1  0.3a 0.3a  1.4a 1.1a \n  SAF113  0.1 0.1  0.3a 0.3a  1.3a 1.0a \n n  4 5  7 5  4 5 \nStat. sig.

In regions \nor years of low rainfall, water may not be transported below the root zone because \nevapotranspiration exceeds precipittion (Lehmann & Schroth, 2003). Such patterns of rainfall, \ntypical of Mediterranean areas, were found at the Spanish LTS (Table 1), where for the arable \nstatus quo, nitrogen leaching was at most minimal (Table 2 \u2013 ALC and CAM). These results \nagree with the general observation that leaching from deep soils under rainfed agriculture in \nMediterranean climates is negligible (Seligman et al., 1992, Sadras, 2002). For the Atlantic \nzone, predicted nitrogen leaching in France and the Netherlands for the arable status quo \nranged from 37 to 155 kg N ha-1 a-1 (Table 2).  This is similar to reported values of 10 to 80 \nkg N ha-1 for annual nitrogen leaching in rainfed agriculture in temperate European locations \n(Nemeth, 1996, Ersahin, 2001, Hoffmann & Johnsson, 2003) or slightly higher values of up to \n100 kg N ha-1 a-1 in other temperate locations (Di & Cameron, 2002, Webster et al., 2003). \nThe highest leaching rates were predicted for the LTS in the Netherlands (Table 2).  Schr\u00f6der \n(1998) reported annual nitrate leaching of 50-250 kg N ha-1 in forage maize systems on sandy \nsoils in the Netherlands. The predicted values in Table 2 therefore appear in reasonable \nagreement with results from the literature. \nScenario comparisons were restricted to the ten French and Dutch test sites where \nnitrogen leaching exceeded 10 kg ha-1 a-1. The result for the LU (Table 4a) showed a \n 13\nsignificant reduction in nitrogen leaching by 54% at 113 trees ha-1 on the best land. At 50 \ntrees ha-1, the impact of trees on crop yields was smaller and thus the length of the profitable \ncropping cycle longer, leading to nitrogen application for a longer period. As a result, the \npredicted reductions of nitrogen leaching were not statistically significant for SAF at 50 trees \nha-1. \n \nTable 4: Predicted annual leaching of nitrogen  (kg N ha-1 a-1) over 60 years under the status quo arable system, \nand after the introduction of silvoarable agroforestry with 50  (SAF50)  or 113 trees ha-1 (SAF113), starting with \neither the best or worst agricultural land, at all sites (>10 kg N ha-1), medium leaching sites (<100 kg N ha-1) and \nhigh leaching sites (>100 kg N ha-1) at a) the plot scale (land unit) and b) the farm\/landscape scale (landscape \ntest site) on 10% or 50% of the land.  \na) Land unit scale  All  Medium                  (< 100 kg N ha-1)  \nHigh                  \n(> 100 kg N ha-1) \n  Worst Best  Worst Best  Worst Best \nStatus quo 90 109  69 37  142ab 182a \nSAF50 85 107  73 44  117ab 171ab \nSAF113 70 66  56 34  105ab 99b \nN 7 6  5 3  2 3 \nStat. sig.

However, when high (>100 \nkg ha-1 a-1) nitrogen leaching sites were analyzed separately, introducing agroforestry at 113 \ntrees ha-1 on 50% of the best land of the farm reduced nitrogen leaching by approximately \n30%, from 134 to 97 kg N ha-1 a-1 (Table 4b). \nHigh nitrogen leaching was generally associated with high crop yields and high \nfertilizer application rates. At such sites, the Yield-SAFE model predicted greater tree-crop \ncompetition resulting in stronger crop yield reductions. Reducing the annual fertilizer \napplications in order to match the decreasing yield potential and ceasing cropping at an earlier \npoint of the 60 year rotation of the system because intercropping was no longer profitable \nwere the main causes of predicted reductions of nitrogen leaching. These effects were less \npronounced at LTS with medium levels of nitrogen leaching, where nitrogen fertilizer \napplication was less intensive and consequently, implementation of SAF did not significantly \nreduce nitrogen leaching (Table 4b). \nThe predicted reduction in nitrogen leaching under SAF appears conservative, \ncompared to reported values of 40 to 75% in temperate agroforestry systems (Udawatta et al., \n2002, Nair & Graetz, 2004). However, the modeling approach used here does not account for \n 14\nthe potential of tree roots to recover nitrogen from below the crop root zone (Sanchez, 1995, \nvan Noordwijk et al., 1996, Livesly et al., 2000, Rowe et al., 2001) nor for the possibility of \nreducing fertilization due to increase of organic matter in the soil as consequence of tree leaf \nfall (Thevathasan & Gordon, 2004). In addition, at farm-scale, the predicted nitrogen leaching \nvalues are the result of only a 10 and 50% conversion of the total farm area to SAF, with the \nremainder of the farm under the current arable crops. \n3.3 Carbon sequestration \nCarbon sequestration was calculated for SAF only, since the primary difference in \nsequestration between arable and SAF systems is due to carbon immobilization in tree \nbiomass (Alegre et al., 2004). Although additional carbon can also be stored in the soil due to \nleaf fall (Dixon, 1995, Montagnini & Nair, 2004) and in the vegetation strip along the tree \nline, these processes were not considered and therefore our values can be considered \nconservative. For the estimates, belowground tree biomass was estimated from the \naboveground tree biomass calculated by Graves et al. (2006) and van der Werf et al. (2006), \nusing allometric relationships (Palma et al., (2006). Sequestration varied in dependence of the \ntree species selected for each LTS. Under the most favorable scenario (113 trees ha-1 on 50% \nin the best quality land) sequestration varied from 0.08 to 0.47 t C ha-1 a-1 for slow growing \ntrees (holm oak and stone pine), from 0.54 to 0.89 t C ha-1 a-1 for moderately fast growing \ntrees (wild cherry and walnut), and from 2.1 to 3.0 t C ha-1 a-1 for fast growing trees (poplar). \nBy year 60, total sequestration was between 5 and 29 t C ha-1, 32 and 54 t C ha-1, and 126 and \n179 t C ha-1 for slow, moderately fast, and fast growing trees respectively (Table 2). These \nvalues are within the range of 3-60 t C ha-1 (K\u00fcrsten, 2000) or 15-198 t C ha-1 (Dixon et al., \n1994) for agroforestry systems and 190 t C ha-1 in poplar forests reported for typical tree \nrotations (van Kooten, 2000, van Kooten et al., 2002, McKenney et al., 2004). \nThe overall analysis does not show statistically significant differences between tree \ndensities (Table 5a). Lower tree densities result in higher biomass per tree (Balandier & \nDupraz, 1998, Graves et al., 2006, van der Werf et al., 2006), somewhat compensating for the \nlow tree density. However, for slow growing trees, carbon sequestration is significantly \nhigher for high tree densities (Table 5a) and when SAF is implemented in a large portion \n(50%) of the farm (Table 5b). With medium-fast growing tree species, these significant \ndifferences do not occur due to a higher variability of carbon sequestration of medium (hybrid \nwalnut and wild cherry) and fast growing trees (poplar). No differences in sequestration were \nfound between SAF systems established on high or low quality land, although sequestration \nwas consistently somewhat higher on the best land. At farm-scale, significant differences in \nsequestration were only found between SAF on 10 or 50% of the farm (Table 5b). \n \n 15\nTable 5: Predicted additional carbon sequestration (t C ha-1) after 60 years, relative to that in an arable control, \nwhen agroforestry with either 50 (SAF50) or 113 trees ha-1(SAF113) is introduced on the worst or best quality \nland for slow growing trees (holm oak and stone pine) and medium-fast growing trees (wild cherry, hybrid \nwalnut and poplar) at a) land unit or b) landscape test site scale. \na) Land unit scale  All  Slow growing  Medium-fast growing \n  Worst Best  Worst Best  Worst Best \nStatus quo 0  0  0 \nSAF50 61 45  14a 16ab  81 106 \nSAF113 67 82  27bc 31c  112 133 \nn 15 15  8 7  7 8 \nStat. sig.

The status quo scenario was \nnot included in the statistical analysis. \n3.4 Landscape biodiversity \nThe habitat index (Ihab; Palma et al., (2005) expresses landscape biodiversity by \nrelating the share of natural and semi-natural habitats to the total area of a given landscape. \nThe introduction of rows of trees in homogeneous arable areas increases the structural \ndiversity of the landscape, which potentially increases its species diversity (Peng et al., 1993, \nBurgess, 1999, Middleton, 2001, Smart et al., 2002). The effect of SAF on 10 and 50% of the \nfarm was examined assuming that hypothetical farms were representative of land use in the \nLTS. \nThe introduction of SAF increased Ihab for all LTS, with the largest increase in areas of \nlow shares of existing natural or semi-natural habitat. The current Ihab of the LTS varied from \nlow values (Ihab < 10%) in homogeneous agricultural landscapes (e.g. Table 2 \u2013 OCA, CHT, \nBAL) to high values (Ihab > 60%) in more heterogeneous areas (e.g. Table 2 \u2013 ALC, ALM, \nCAR). Ihab \u2013values of around 10% increased by a factor of 4 (e.g. CAM), while Ihab \u2013values of \naround 80% increased by about a factor of only 1.15 (e.g. ALC). Mean Ihab of all LTS under \nthe status quo was 25%. With 10% of the land under SAF, Ihab increased by a factor of 1.28, \nbut significant differences (p<0.01) were only found when SAF was implemented on 50% of \nthe farm, increasing Ihab by a factor of 2.6 (Ihab = 62%). \nThe habitat index approach can be considered a general and easy method for \nestimating landscape biodiversity, because it follows the generally accepted principle that \nlandscape heterogeneity favors most taxa (Forman & Godron, 1986). Trees can provide a \nhabitat for some bird, arthropod and small mammal species which otherwise can not inhabit \narable landscapes (Peng et al., 1993, Klaa et al., 2005). The grassy or herbaceous strips below \nthe trees consist of either sown plant species or arable weeds. Their contribution to species \ndiversity is equally important, but will depend strongly on management (Griffiths et al., 1998, \nBurgess et al., 2003); a factor not assessed here. The method does not differentiate between \n 16\nSAF systems at different densities. Subsequent analyses should refine the approach and \nconsider the characteristics and requirements of specific landscapes.  \n3.5 European scale implications \nReisner et al. (2006) identified 90 million hectares (Mha) of European arable land \npotentially suitable for SAF systems using hybrid walnut, wild cherry, poplar, holm oak and \nstone pine. Within this area, the study identified 65 Mha where SAF could potentially reduce \nsoil erosion and nitrogen leaching, and increase landscape biodiversity. Our investigation \naddresses the potential extent of those environmental benefits of SAF systems, also including \ncarbon sequestration.  \nEight million hectares of European arable land are seriously threatened by erosion \n(Reisner et al., 2006) and SAF, with one of the five tree species examined here, could \npotentially be implemented on 2.6 Mha of this land (Reisner et al., 2006). If farmers in these \nareas would combine SAF with contouring on the best 50% of their farm land, soil erosion \ncould be reduced by as much as 65%.  \nNitrogen leaching could be reduced on 12 Mha of land (Reisner et al., 2006) through \nuse of SAF, mainly in central and northern Europe. These reductions could potentially be as \nhigh as 28%, if SAF was implemented at high densities (113 trees ha-1) on 50% of the best \nfarmland. In addition, nitrogen uptake below the root zone of annual crops might further \nreduce nitrogen leaching at these sites, although this has not been considered here and \nrequires future investigations. \nCarbon sequestration could also be increased on the 90 Mha of European arable land \npotentially suitable for SAF (Reisner et al., 2006). The use of medium-fast growing tree \nspecies in SAF systems, when implemented on 50% of the agricultural land, could contribute \n46 - 96 t C ha-1 (0.77 - 1.6 t C ha-1a-1) to sequestration over a 60-year period. However, values \nup to 179 t C ha-1 (3 t C ha-1a-1) are potentially feasible. Our assessment of potential carbon \nsequestration differs from that of the European Climate Change Program (ECCP), which \nestimates that less than one million hectare of land in Europe is suitable for agroforestry, and \nthat no net change in annual carbon balance will occur by 2010 (ECCP, 2003). However, this \nrepresents a medium-term perspective. The actual adoption of SAF will depend on both, its \nprofitability and its legal status, which could change in the coming years, stimulating the \nuptake of SAF systems by European farmers (Lawson et al., 2004, Lawson et al., 2005).  \nMonotonous arable landscapes, defined by Reisner et al. (2006) as areas where arable \nland covers over 50% of the total land area in a 25 km2 area, cover about 100 Mha in Europe \n(Reisner et al., 2006). Approximately 21 Mha of this land would be suitable for SAF using \none of the five tree species tested here, which could significantly increase landscape \nbiodiversity. This broad assessment, however, needs further refinement by taking into account \nspecific landscape characteristics on the one hand and target species on the other hand. Baldi \net al. (2005) and Stoate et al. (2003) have shown that it is impossible to design a management \nscheme that favors all species. Moreover, for some steppic wildlife species, open rather than \nstructured landscapes are required (e.g. Otis tarda L.), and some regions, such as \nBrandenburg (northern Germany) are traditionally characterized by large open fields with \nspecific combinations of fauna and flora. \n \n 17\n4 Conclusion  \nThe results for 19 randomly selected LTS in Spain, France, and the Netherlands \nshowed that adoption of silvoarable agroforestry systems can potentially lead to reduced soil \nerosion and nitrogen leaching and increased carbon sequestration and landscape biodiversity.  \nThe extent of the modifications depends on the characteristics of individual sites and the \nmanagement of the SAF system proposed for each location. Predicted environmental benefits \nwere highest when SAF was implemented on large areas (i.e. 50% of the farm \/ landscape) on \nhigh quality land, where current agricultural practices are most intensive and thus associated \nwith higher levels of soil erosion and nitrogen leaching. Tree density (50 or 113 trees ha-1) \nappears less important, as in stands of lower density biomass production per tree is higher, \nreducing the difference in values of the indicators on an area basis.  \nAgroforestry systems are highly diverse. We only examined five tree species in \ncombination with five crops but, of course, many more tree species and crop types can and \nshould be considered. Their choice and the manifold possible layouts of the system with \nrespect to the density and arrangement need to be adapted to local conditions and farmer\u2019s \npreferences. All those options can only be fully explored with modeling approaches. Such \nmodels, however, must be validated on the basis of experimental data from these systems and \nsuch data are scarce. \nIn Europe, new land-use systems should (also) yield environmental benefits. The \nresults presented here increase our understanding of the environmental benefits that can be \nexpected from modern agroforestry systems and complement an economic analysis of such \nsystems by Graves et al. (2006) for the same test sites. Further analysis will address the \nintegrated economic and environmental evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of SAF \nsystems. \n \nAcknowledgements \nPart of this study was funded through the European Union 5th Framework contract \nQLK5-2001-00560 and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research contract \n00.0158.
