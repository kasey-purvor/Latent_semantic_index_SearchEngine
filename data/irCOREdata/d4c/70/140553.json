The mechanisms behind the\nspread of E. coliO157:H7 on the farm are complex and poorly understood. The objective of this study\nwas to apply a Monte Carlo model, constructed to simulate the propagation of E. coli O157:H7 in\ncattle and sheep on the farm, to both test the effect of different interventions on the risk of animals\ncarrying E. coli O157:H7 to the abattoir and to develop understanding of the underlying processes,\nincluding the identification of areas that could benefit from further research. An overview of the\nmodel including key assumptions is given.\nThe output statistics from batches of 100 runs of the model were collected. From the model output,\na cumulative frequency distribution of the prevalence and specific shedding level for the groups of\ncattle or sheep being sent to the abattoir were generated. Stochastic dominance was used to compare\nthe results of the model outputs.\nUsing the shorthand that \u2018\u2018risk\u2019\u2019 means the likelihood of carrying E. coli O157:H7 to the abattoir,\nkey conclusions from the study included: mixing sheep and cattle increases the risk in both groups;\nmerging groups of animals of the same species into larger groups increases the risk substantially;\nincreasing stocking density increases the risk independently of group size; decreasing the group size\ndecreases the E. coliO157:H7 prevalence independently of stocking density; a very high level of barn\nhygiene reduces the risk; a shorter time between spreading farmyard manure and grazing and an\nincreased background level of E. coli O157:H7 in the model increases the risk. The background level\ncould be influenced by the presence of wild animals carrying the organism.\nwww.elsevier.com\/locate\/prevetmed\nPreventive Veterinary Medicine 79 (2007) 32\u201345\n* Corresponding author.

Introduction\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 was first identified as a human pathogen in 1982 in two\noutbreaks of gastrointestinal illness associated with the consumption of hamburgers from a\nfast food chain in the United States (Riley et al., 1983). E. coli O157:H7 may cause severe\ndisease and death in humans. In an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection in Scotland in\n1996, as many as 496 people may have been affected and 20 people died from eating cold\ncooked meats probably cross-contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 in raw meat in a\nbutcher\u2019s shop (Ahmed and Donaghy, 1998). Anxiety in Great Britain has been further\nheightened by two recent outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in South Wales in September 2005\n(117 cases) and in the Brecon area in November 2005 (12 cases). Cattle, and possibly\nsheep, are currently recognised as the principal reservoirs responsible for the proliferation\nof E. coliO157:H7 on farms (Wallace, 1999). However, there has also been isolation of the\norganism from other farm animal species, such as goats, deer and chickens.\nThis paper gives an overview of a model, con tructed to simulate the propagation of E.\ncoli O157:H7 in cattle and sheep on the farm. The model is used to test the effect of\ndifferent farm management interventions on the risk of animals carrying E. coli O157:H7\nto the abattoir and to develop understanding of the underlying processes. Further details of\nthe model may be found in Parsons et al. (2002).\n2. Materials and methods\nA stochastic simulation model was developed within which risks can be calculated and\nthe consequences of actions explored. A literature review and information gathered from\nfarm visits were used to inform the construction of the model. A consultation workshop\nwith experts from outside the project was held to review the proposed structure and\nconcepts (Parsons, 2001). The construction of the model was based largely on data from\nGreat Britain. The model consists of two parts:\n\u0002 a deterministic simulation of the interactions between animals, feed, enclosures and\nwaste on cattle and sheep farms to study the impact of different factors (described in\nSection 2.1);\n\u0002 a stochastic simulation of the epidemiology of E. coli O157:H7 to study the likelihood\nthat animals for the abattoir are carrying E. coli O157:H7 (described in Section 2.2).\nEach run of the simulation resulted in one possible outcome of the system with values\nfor prevalence and distributions of specific shedding level (CFU\/g) of E. coli O157:H7\nK.F. Stacey et al. \/ Preventive Veterinary Medicine 79 (2007) 32\u201345 33\nAu\nth\nor\n's \n  p\ner\nso\nna\nl   \nco\npy\nthroughout the year for each group of animals. By performing batches of runs, distributions\nfor the model outputs were obtained. The impact of changes to the management of the\nfarm, or to the underlying assumptions, were examined.\n2.1. Farm system part of the model\nThe farm system part of the model provided a general, flexible structure to describe\nfactors likely to influence the transmission of E. coli O157:H7 such as the movements of\nanimals, contact between animals and movement of waste. A single model flexible enough\nto represent almost any conventional type of cattle or sheep farm was developed.\nIn the model, a group of animals is a collection of individuals of similar age that are\nnormally kept together and treated alike. Twoormoregroupsmay share the same enclosure at\nsome times, and be separated at other times. A resourcewas defined as any potential reservoir\nor vector for O157:H7, such as a field, a building, a slurry store or a feed trough. Resources\nwill often be shared by several groups of animal, so they may be a route for cross-infection\nbetween animals (within and between groups). Four types of resources are distinguished in\nthemodel: enclosures (further divided into fields, yards and barns), waste stores, feed troughs\nand water troughs. Table 1 gives the attributes of the groups and resources.\nThe specification of an individual farm is defined by input files: the number of fields,\nyards, barns and the number of animals in each age group on the farm; the characteristics of\neach enclosure, each group of animals, storage of waste; movement of waste; birth; death\nand movement of animals within and on and off the farm. Meteorological data and the\nparameters of the model, such as the decay rate of E. coli O157:H7 in different\nenvironments are also given in an input file.\nTo be able to compare the effects of diff rent interventions, the parts of the farm that\ncould be controlled or partially controlled by the farm manager are deterministic. For\nexample, the movement of animals from one enclosure to another, but also the week in\nwhich animals are born or die on the farm, are determined by input files.\nK.F. Stacey et al. \/ Preventive Veterinary Medicine 79 (2007) 32\u20134534\nTable 1\nGroup and resource attributes used in simulation model for Escherichia coli in cattle and sheep\nGroup Resources\nEnclosure Water trough Feed trough Waste store\nName Name Volume Type of feed\n(silage, concentrate\nand hay)\nMass of\ncontentsType (sheep, cattle) Type Cleaning\ninterval\nAge Number of groups\nAge of weaning List of groups\nEnclosure Area\nNumber of animals Area grazed\nWeight of one animal Area of silage\nFeed intake per animal Frequency of\ncleaningWater intake per animal\nFaeces production per animal\nProportion of each type of feed\nAu\nth\nor\n's \n  p\ner\nso\nna\nl   \nco\npy\nA single run of the model simulates a period of at least 1 year using a fixed time step of 1\nweek. At the start of a run a set of entities (groups and resources) are created. Simple models\nare used for the time-dependent attributes, with coefficients that depend on the type of\nanimals. Weight is linearly dependent on age, up to a maximum for the species. Dry matter\nfeed intake is a power law function of weight. Water intake is proportional to feed intake.\nFaeces production is linearly dependent on feed intake. Other variables are updated through\nthe linkage between groups and resources, for example, the volume of slurry in a waste store\ndepends on the rate of production of all the animal groups in the enclosures feeding it.\nAnimals leaving the farm for sale as livestock, culling or the abattoir are handled by\nmoving them into special groups which are emptied at the end of the time step. This allows\nrelevant information on the animals leaving the farm to be collated. The farmmodel is always\nset up to simulate a steady state, that is, with identical numbers and ages of animals in each\ngroup at the same time each year (after 12 months the model is back to the initial state).\n2.2. Epidemiological part of the model\nThe epidemiological part of the model simulates the carriage and transmission of E. coli\nO157:H7 within and between groups of animals and resources (Tables 2 and 3). The\nentities described in the farm model were given additional attributes related to E. coli\nO157:H7 that quantified the infection of groups or contamination of resources. Both the\nprevalence and the level of shedding are described by the number of animals with a specific\nshedding rate (concentration of E. coliO157:H7 in faeces) in each of a series of logarithmic\nranges: 0, 0\u201310, . . ., 107 to 108 CFU\/g (used to calculate shedding rates). For each\nresource, the growth or decay of E. coli O157:H7 and transfers to and from other entities\nwere considered. The model works with groups of animals with respect to farm\nmanagement and on an individual basis with respect to transmission of E. coli O157:H7.\nThe epidemiological part of the model is a stochastic simulation: many of the transitions\nin the model are described by probability distributions. Some of the processes in the model\nare temperature dependent. A set of 30 years weather data from Birmingham was gathered\nand reduced to 30 years of weekly mean temperatures. For each week in a run of the\nsimulation, one of the 30 weekly mean temperatures for that week is randomly selected.\nThe weekly temperatures are thus treated as independent random variables distributed\nabout the long-term mean.\nEach run simulated 10 years with the farm model in a steady-state and the results were\nsampled from the last year only. A period of 10 years was found to be sufficient to stabilise\nthe output so that there was little trend over time of either increasing or decreasing\nprevalence or mean shedding rate.\n2.2.1. Infection of animals and the dose-response relationship\nExperimental and field studies indicate that cattle do not develop effective immunity to\ncolonisation by E. coli O157:H7 (Shere et al., 1998; Sanderson et al., 1999). No immunity\nwas assumed and the same transition matrix is used for na\u0131\u00a8ve and previously infected\nanimals, and animals cannot be reinfected whilst shedding.\nThe total dose of E. coli O157:H7 received by an animal from all the routes discussed\nabove is calculated. The probability of infection is calculated according to the dose\u2013\nK.F.

The parameters were adjusted to give infection rates similar to those reported in the\nliterature. An increase in the probability of infection with dose, and a decrease with age of\nthe host has been demonstrated (Cray and Moon, 1995; Cornick et al., 2000). The dose is\nstandardised by dividing by the host mass. It was assumed that animals are immune until\nweaning (Paiba et al., 2003).\n2.3. Parameterisation and calibration\nWherever possible, data from experiments or observational studies at the level of\nindividual processes were used to set parameter values in the model. There were also useful\ndata on features such as the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in slurry, soil, etc., from which\nreasonable extrapolations could be made to other conditions. There were limited data from\nwhich approximate estimates could be made for other parameters, such as the transition\nparameters (for infection) and the dose\u2013response relationship.\nThe remaining parameters were set by considering the overall behaviour of the model in\ncomparison with farm observations. In all of the routes of transmission, such as from the\nfeed trough or from grazing, there is at least one parameter where there is great uncertainty.\nThese parameters were adjusted collectively to give prevalence levels that approximated to\nthose found in the literature (Paiba et al., 2003).\nIn order to achieve a sufficiently low prevalence in sheep, the parameter relating dose to\nthe product of grass consumption and the concentration of E. coliO157:H7 was lower than\nfor cattle. New infections on farms that have been clear for somemonths are uncommon, so\nthe background level of infectivity was set to give typically two to four infections per year.\nInsufficient evidence existed for a seasonal pattern of prevalences to be used.\n2.4. Farm system specifications\nInput files were constructed for four different types of farm: a beef breeder\u2013finisher\nfarm, a beef finisher farm, a sheep farm and a mixed beef and sheep farm. In each of these\nbase cases the interval between slurry spreading and grazing was 4 weeks; slurry\/manure\nwas cleared from the barns every 2 weeks and the water troughs were cleaned every 5\nweeks. The animal to animal contact rate was five per day. Modifications to these farms\nwere constructed to test the effect of interventions. The farm system specifications are\ngiven in Table 4. The mixed beef and sheep farm specifications considered the effects on\nthe prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and sheep in the case where all the grazing was\nshared compared with the same stock kept in separate fields. Inter-species contact was\nassumed to be as likely as intra-species when co-grazing. Unless otherwise specified other\nmanagement variables were the same as for the single species farms.\n2.5.

For the base case, all the parameters were set to their default values and three\nbatches of 100 runs of the model were performed. Each of the parameters selected for\nanalysis was then increased and decreased individually, and two batches of 100 runs were\nperformed for each setting. Parameters related to transmission rates or concentrations were\nnormally multiplied and divided by 10 (i.e. a one log unit change). The decay rate\nexponents are temperature dependent and typically lie in the range 0.2\u20130.9; the size of the\nchanges used in the sensitivity analysis was 0.1. The animal to animal contact rate was\nnormally five per day and values of 1 and 20 were tested.\nIn each case the changes were assessed by considering the magnitude of the change in\nthe mean prevalence (averaged over 200 runs) from the standard mean prevalence\n(averaged over 300 runs) at four points in the year: weeks 9, 22, 35 and 45. Animals are\nhoused during weeks 9 and 45 and graze during the weeks 22 and 35. Splitting each trial\ninto batches allowed the variability resulting from the model to be considered.\n2.5.2. Effect of interventions on simulated farms\nFirst order stochastic dominance (Hardaker et al., 2004) was used to test the effect of\ndifferent interventions on the risk of different levels of prevalence and specific shedding\nlevel in cattle and sheep being sent to the abattoir, from each type of farm.\nTo assess first order stochastic dominance (hereafter dominance), the data were plotted\nas cumulative frequency distributions (CFDs), by sorting the data in order of increasing\nmagnitude of the variable of interest and plotting the order in the list, giving the frequency\nagainst the variable. Dominance was determined through the comparison of two CFDs for\nthe same variable before and after an intervention. The curve that is wholly to the left or\nabove the other is said to dominate, because it is clearly the preferable outcome. For each\nfarm several possible interventions were tested to identify those having a substantial effect.\nTwo batches of 100 runs were performed for each of the first two farms to ensure that the\nresults were reproducible. It was found that the differences between the two batches of 100\nruns used for the study of the first two farms were small, so one batch of 100 runs was used\nfor each option from this point on.\nIn the farm interventions, note that in each case when the slurry spreading date was\nchanged, the grazing date was not; instead there was a change in the interval between\nspreading and grazing. When the farm size was changed, the number of groups was kept\nconstant; the numbers of animals and enclosure areas were changed in proportion; so this\nwas considering the effect of group size independently of stocking density. Similarly the\neffect of reducing stocking density was tested independently from the farm size; stocking\ndensity was reduced by reducing the area of grazing and keeping the number of animals\nconstant.\n3. Results\n3.1. Validation and calibration\nIt was possible to calibrate the model so that it produced prevalence values close to those\nreported in the literature (Paiba et al., 2003). In a recent survey of dairy and beef farms in\nK.F. Stacey et al. \/ Preventive Veterinary Medicine 79 (2007) 32\u201345 39\nAu\nth\nor\n's \n  p\ner\nso\nna\nl   \nco\npy\nEngland andWales, Paiba et al. (2003) found that the overall animal prevalence (proportion\nof animals shedding) was 4.7% across all farm types, and 10.5% in fattener herds, which\nwas consistent with several other surveys reported in the literature. From the model output,\nthe mean animal prevalence for the beef fattener herd was 14%, a little higher than that\nfound by Paiba et al. (2003). The results for other farm types for cattle were reasonably\nconsistent with the observations. However, Paiba et al. (2003) also reported that the herd\nprevalence was 44% and the within herd prevalence was 10.2%. The corresponding values\nfor the abattoir group in the model were 21% and 44%.\nComparable recent data for sheep were fewer. Small et al. (2002) found E. coli O157 in\n7.2% of cattle lairages and 2.2% of sheep lairages, and also on 28.8% of cattle hides and\n5.5% of sheep. A tentative extrapolation would then suggest that animal prevalences\nshould be around one-fifth to one-quarter of those in cattle, i.e. about 1\u20132.5%. The full\nrange of results shown later was 0.25\u20135.8%, with the base cases around 1%. The model\ngenerated herd prevalence was 25% and a within herd prevalence of 2.9%, which was\nprobably a more realistic combination than for cattle.\nE. coli O157:H7 was present at some time in almost all the simulated farms in the later\nyears (i.e. not as a result of initial conditions). Consistent with observational data from the\nliterature (for instance, Mechie et al., 1997), in the simulated farms cattle and sheep often\nhad more than one episode of E. coli O157:H7 colonisation and shedding; the shedding\nlevel and duration were highly variable amongst individuals.\n3.2. Sensitivity analysis\nThe standard mean prevalences at the four selected weeks were 14.8%, 16.5%, 13.6%\nand 11.3%. The mean absolute differences between sets were 1.9%, 2.0%, 1.5% and\n1.6%, respectively. Several parameters increased or decreased the mean prevalence by\nmore than twice the mean absolute difference between batches, for the same farm\nspecification and for \u00031 of the four sampling points in the year. These more sensitive\nparameters were: those influencing the decay rates for grassland, barns and slurry stores;\ntransmission from the enclosure and from grass; animal to animal contact rate; faeces\ndose per contact between animals; age at which animals are first susceptible to infection.\nLess sensitive parameters were: water decay rate; contamination of water from animals;\ntransmission from feed.\nIt is clear that, for the sizes of changes made, most of the parameters relating to\ntransmission of E. coli O157:H7 to the animals had larger effects than the decay rates,\nespecially the one related to grazing. Of the decay rates, the one for grassland had the\nlargest effect. Changing the age of weaning, so that calves were susceptible from birth\nresulted in a substantial increase in prevalence. Contrary to expectations, increasing the\nbarn decay rate, increased the prevalence.\n3.3. Effect of interventions on simulated farms\nTables 5\u20137 show the results of different interventions on the beef breeder\u2013finisher farm,\nthe beef fattener farm and the sheep farm on prevalence and shedding of E. coliO157:H7 in\nanimals destined for slaughter.

Breeder\u2013finisher farm and beef fattener farm\nThere were 13 interventions tested on the breeder\u2013finisher farm (Table 5) and the beef\nfattener farm (Table 6) relative to the base case for each farm. The interventions tested on\nthese farms were comparable, but a couple of differences should be noted. The option of\nmixing the animals in one field in summer was used in the breeder\u2013finisher farm, but in the\nbeef fattener farm it was more appropriate to use a single barn in winter to test the effect of\nmixing.\nThe relative size and direction of the effects were similar across the two farms with\nsome differences in ordering. Increasing the farm size had a strong detrimental impact.\nMixing the groups during summer grazing or in winter housing increased and reducing the\ncontact rate decreased prevalence and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in animals destined for\nslaughter. Reducing the interval between spreading slurry and grazing the land from 4 to 2\nweeks increased prevalence and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in animals destined for\nslaughter, whereas increasing it to 6 weeks had only a small negative effect. Reducing the\nbackground level of E. coli O157:H7, which could reflect general hygiene or carriage by\nvermin and other animals, decreased prevalence and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in\nanimals destined for slaughter.\nVery frequent barn cleaning decreased prevalence and shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in\nanimals destined for slaughter on both farms, although the latter assumes that all E. coli\nO157:H7 are removed, which is highly unlikely in practice. Finally, assuming a 5% E. coli\nO157:H7 prevalence in the stock purchased each year strongly increased the presence of E.\ncoli O157:H7 on both farms.\n3.3.2. Sheep farm\nThere were six interventions tested on the sheep farm (Table 7). The effect of changing\nstocking density was tested only on this farm. Consistent with the cattle farms, increasing\nfarm size, stocking density and contact rate produced marked increases in the prevalence\nand the converse measures tended to reduce it. The effect of changes in contact rate is\ngreater than on the cattle farms. Contrary to expectations reducing incoming prevalence\nhad a slightly detrimental effect.\nK.F.

Mixed beef and sheep farm\nTable 8 shows the effects on mean prevalence and shedding in both calves and lambs on\na mixed beef and sheep farm. Mixing with cattle caused a substantial increase in mean\nprevalence and shedding amongst the lambs. The CFDs for the lambs showed that separate\ngrazing was dominant in both variables. Mixing also caused a substantial increase in mean\nprevalence amongst the calves, though the effect on mean shedding was fairly small.\nExamination of the CFDs for the cattle showed that separate grazing was dominant when\nmeasured by prevalence, but a few farms with high mean shedding rates meant that the\ncurves for shedding rate crossed and explained the small effect on the mean.\n4. Discussion\nIn a simulation study of this type, where the system being simulated is complex and\ngood data are sparse, care is needed when interpreting the results, which necessarily reflect\nthe assumptions built into the model. The parameters with a high level of uncertainty were\nadjusted to give reasonable relative doses on the basis of very little information. Therefore,\nthe model cannot be used to determine which transmission route, for instance from grazing\nor from barns, is most important; more data would be required for it to be able to do this.\nFurthermore, the underestimation of the within herd prevalence compared to the herd\nprevalence of the model is likely to have led to an overestimation of the effect of\ninterventions affecting the herd prevalence (background level of E. coli O157:H7 and\nprevalence of purchased stock) and an underestimation of those affecting the within herd\nprevalence (the remaining interventions). The tests used to generate the results and the\ninterpretation of these results reported here were chosen to be robust, so that changes in\nuncertain parameter values would not have a major effect on the conclusions.\nThe strongly detrimental and consistent effect of increasing the farm size may be\nbecause there is a lower probability of E. coli O157:H7 entering and being maintained in a\nsmaller population, than in a larger population. A similar argument may be applied to the\ndetrimental effect of mixing groups during summer grazing or in winter housing.\nContact rate was included as one of the interventions, as well as in the sensitivity\nanalysis, since it may be influenced by the farm management, for example by reducing the\nstocking rate. However, there is still much to learn about what affects the contact rate\nbetween farm animals, the contact structure and the amount of faecal material transferred at\neach contact. The effect of contact rate is greater in sheep farms than on cattle farms,\nK.F. Stacey et al. \/ Preventive Veterinary Medicine 79 (2007) 32\u201345 43\nTable 8\nEffect of mixed grazing on the prevalence of shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and lambs being sent to the\nabattoir (cattle: first week of April; lambs: first week of October)\nGroup Mixing Mean animal prevalence (%) Mean specific shedding (CFU\/g)\nLambs Fully mixed 5 580\nLambs Separate grazing 0.9 140\nCattle Fully mixed 22 13,000\nCattle Separate grazing 10 13,000\nAu\nth\nor\n's \n  p\ner\nso\nna\nl   \nco\npy\npossibly due to the dynamics of infection that lead to a greater within herd prevalence\ncompared to herd prevalence in sheep farms compared to beef farms.\nThe detrimental effect of mixing species is greater than would be expected from an\nincrease in stocking rate alone, which was relatively small in this comparison. The increase\nin risk in both cattle and sheep may be due to the different dynamics of propagation in each\nof the two species helping to sustain infection in the other group. More research is needed\nto understand these dynamics better.\nThe three results where the direction of change was opposite to expectations cannot be\neasily explained without further investigation, but they are probably the result of the\nintrinsic variability of the model.\n5. Conclusions\nThe main conclusions from the study, are that the likelihood that animals going to the\nabattoir are carrying E. coli O157:H7 is increased by mixing cattle and sheep and merging\ngroups of the same species into larger groups. Similarly increasing the farm or group size,\nindependently of stocking density and increasing stocking density, independently of group\nsize, increases the risk. A very high level of barn hygiene reduces the risk; but the\ndifference between intermediate and poor levels is small, except when a barn is used all\nyear round. Constructing and testing models is part of an iterative process and often raises\npertinent questions stimulating further research in modelling and in observational and\nexperimental studies. The parameters towhich the model is most sensitive (and hence those\nthat it is most important to quantify) are the ones related to: transmission from grass and\nenclosures to animals; contact between animals; pathogen survival on grass, in slurry and\nin barns.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Defra project OZ0708 and\nthe contribution from farmers who participated in the study.\nReferences\nAhmed, S., Donaghy, M., 1998.
