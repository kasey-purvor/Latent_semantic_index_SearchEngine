Maini\nCentre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford,\nOxford, OX1 3LB, UK\nPublished online: March 28 2006\nC\u00a9 Society for Mathematical Biology 2006\nWelcome to the new look Bulletin of Mathematical Biology which is now be-\ning published by Springer. As you probably know Springer has a long history of\npublishing in mathematics, and specifically in mathematical biology hence I think\nthis will be a good partnership for both Springer and the Society. Under Springer,\nthe journal will increase the number of pages published per year, as well as install\na manuscript tracking system to speed up publication of articles. Papers will be\npublished Online First in full text via Springerlink, Springer\u2019s electronic journal\nplatform, which can presently be accessed by around 5000 institutions worldwide.\nPapers will be assigned DOI numbers when they are published online allowing\nthem to be citable.\nAnother new feature includes submission of ancillary materials, such as video,\nillustrations, data sets, etc. which may be submitted for online publication with\nyour article. These materials are subject to review and approval of the editorial\nstaff, and should be included with article submission.\nAs we all know, Mathematical Biology is one of the fastest growing fields in\nscience today. As evidence of that, the submission rate to the Bulletin has doubled\nover the past four years. In order to reduce publication times the Bulletin will\nnow be published eight times a year. The healthy state of the journal is due in no\nsmall part to the previous Editor, Lee Segel. He was one of the founder members\nof modern Mathematical Biology and contributed seminal research in a number of\ndiverse areas. Simultaneously, the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology became one of\nthe main journals in the area under his editorship. In recognition of Lee\u2019s immense\ncontribution to the field Springer has kindly offered to fund a series of prizes in\nhis memory linked to papers published in the journal. There will be three prize\ncategories: best original research student paper (awarded every two years); best\noriginal research paper (awarded every two years); best review paper (awarded\nevery three years).\nThis is an exciting time for the journal and I look forward to working with the\nSpringer team.\n"}
