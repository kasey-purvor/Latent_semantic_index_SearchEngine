One of the key constituents of HR policy, MTD claims to\npromote new approaches to the management of people, in which attitudes and tacit\nknowledge are developed as a key source of competitive advantage in response to rapidly\nchanging market conditions (IPD, 1997). Increasingly MTD is seen as an instrument of\norganisational change, used through the competency movement, Investors in People (IIP)\nstandard and Management Charter initiatives as a way of linking people performance to the\nbusiness strategy (Iles, 1993, Holmes and Joyce, 1993). It is a major growth industry; in the\nUK alone it was worth approximately \u00a32 billion in 1994 with around 2,750 management\nconsultancy and training \u00ae rms competing for this market (Williams, 1996). \nWillmott (1994) broadly classi\u00ae ed this domain of management learning in terms of MTD,\nwhich is largely concerned with organisational activities to develop managerial com-\npetence, and management education, which is often funded by the state. Management\neducation has become the preserve of higher education institutions, and tends to devote\nmore time to examining the wider social responsibilities of managerial work than MTD.\nThe upsurge of activity and investment in both these arenas has generated a healthy deb-\nate in the academic community about the effectiveness, underpinning values and social\nimpact of MTD. Williams, in a searing attack on the industry, describes the content of many\nMTD `courses\u2019 as being based on f`ashionable pseudo-theory, therapy and quack remedies\u2019\nand the methods used as relying on `pretentious American pyscho-babble... highlighting the\nimportance of positive stroking, huddling and \u00aa Zeus Culture\u00ba ... with the occasional Zen or\nEastern input.\u2019 (1996: 3). Mole (1996), in describing much of this type of activity as `genre\ntraining\u2019, highlights the gap between social science research and training practice in MTD\nand calls for greater effort to be placed on resolving the `considerable methodological prob-\nlems in evaluating training effectiveness\u2019 (1996: 24). Indeed, a study from the International\nInstitute of Management Development (IMD), in Lausanne, into current practice in assessing\nthe impact of management development in international organisations found that 80 per cent\nof respondents were unable to quantify the impact of such alleged investment (Cairns, 1997).\nRainbird\u2019 s (1994) analysis of 21 case study organisations supports these \u00ae ndings and\nidenti\u00ae es other concerns about the effectiveness of MTD activities, in particular the lack of\nintegration between HRM and MTD. The study highlights four key reasons for this: the con-\n\u00af icting rationales of business and HR strategies; lack of line management expertise in HR\nplanning; the organisation of the training function itself not being well integrated with\nbroader personnel responsibilities; and, perhaps most importantly, the \u00ae nancial procedures\nused to account for MTD expenditure encourage a short-term perspective (1994: 87). Butcher\net al (1997), in their study into the effectiveness of a number of public management dev-\nelopment programmes, show that the sponsoring organisations provided very little long-\nterm, post-programme monitoring of, or interest in, their managers, despite having invested\nManagement development as\na game of meaningless outcomes\nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\nbetween \u00a35,000 and nearly \u00a39,000 on programmes of two to three-week duration. The crit-\nique from respected academics seems to grow in direct proportion to the investment in MTD.\nEven within companies themselves, managers often demonstrate scepticism on the\neffectiveness of much MTD. Post-programme behaviour change is usually greeted with: `He\nmust have been on a training course; don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be back to normal in a few days\u2019 (see\nAckers and Preston, 1997). Recent research from Cranfield shows that 40 per cent of\nmanagers in a survey population of 123 believed that money was wasted in many MTD\nactivities (Atkinson and Meldrum, 1998).\nSo why the discrepancy? Why are organisations spending more money than ever on an\nactivity which seems of questionable value? Willmott (1994) provides an extensive\nexamination of the power and control issues inherent in the provision of management dev-\nelopment and education in the UK. In recent years much MTD effort has been concentrated\non the competency approach. This model has come to be seen as a critical bridge between\norganisational strategy and people development, enabling investment in MTD to be focused\ntoward key organisational performance issues (Lee, 1996). However, for Willmott, this\napproach has tended to marginalise the `personal and social competencies that are not\nreadily standardised, measured or evaluated\u2019 and `does little to develop the capacity to learn\nhow to understand the complexities of management practice or to respond to new chal-\nlenges.\u2019 (1994: 110). While management education has a greater opportunity to consider the\nwider social responsibilities of managers, it is caught within a number of debilitating\ninstitutional barriers. For example, the pressure for academics to specialise and the compet-\nition for career advancement has helped produce a disinterest or resistance among manage-\nment academics to explore alternative approaches to management education (1994: 117).\nWillmott\u2019s focus is mostly on the issues surrounding publicly-funded management\neducation. This article will build on this body of work by investigating in more detail how\npower relations are enacted within the workplace through MTD to identify the sources of\nthis contradiction of increasing investment for doubtful return. The traditional study of\nMTD has been through a systems-based contingency model of MTD (van der Krogt and\nWarmerdam, 1997). However, this approach, while acknowledging the importance of power\nas an organisational variable, fails to address it in any speci\u00ae c fashion (Burrell and Morgan\n1979). The enactment of MTD is explicitly concerned with the exercise of power (Hop\u00af and\nDawes, 1995; Coopey, 1995). Accordingly, in order to be able to deal with the political and\nrelational aspects of MTD, this article will use an actor-orientated approach. According to\nvan der Krogt and Warmerdam, (1997: 89):\n[MTD is a manifestation] of the continuous game that goes on in an organisation, in which\ndifferent actors with different positions, interests and action theories, seek to in\u00af uence and\nuse the rules, facilities, systems and processes in and around the organisation in such a\nway as to achieve as favourable a result as possible for themselves. \nMTD therefore becomes an organisational game that is used to further particular power\nrelations. Using this game perspective, this article will identify some of the reasons why\nthere is so much activity in MTD but so few meaningful outcomes. Attention will be given to\nexploring the in\u00af uence of MTD professionals and the impact of the normative frameworks\nand institutionalised power relations embedded in this organisational game. The article also\nconsiders the value of, and opportunity for, different approaches to the enactment of MTD\nand concludes with irony that it is MTD itself which could be most effective in initiating\nchange. However, to do this, those involved in the MTD industry will have to expose\nthemselves as part of the problem.\nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\n39HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nManagement development as a game of meaningless outcomes\n40 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nBACKSTAGE ACTIVITY\nMTD is central to strategic HRM policies of increasing employee commitment, the develop-\nment of greater workforce \u00af exibility, the raising of employee contribution etc. It is intended\nas a catalyst for change (Doyle, 1995) and therefore MTD professionals have been increas-\ningly viewed as agents of change. The impact and outcomes of MTD will therefore be, in\npart, a re\u00af ection the competency of MTD professionals to make a difference and the extent\nto which they and other organisational actors are able to manage or allow such change. \nSo what sort of impact do they make? Work by Buchanan and Boddy (1992) into the\n`public performance and backstage activity\u2019 of the change agent highlights the need for\nchange agents to manage three parallel agendas (1992: 28): \nl Content agenda: the substance of the change eg introducing teamworking, in which the\nchange agent must have technical competence;\nl Control agenda: planning, budgeting, resourcing etc; and\nl Process agenda: implementation skills in terms of in\u00af uencing, negotiation, political skills\nin managing resistance, building coalitions and the management of ritual and meaning.\nMore recent work by Pitt et al (1997) reveals the delicate political process of creating the\nagenda in the \u00ae rst place before any of the above is executed. The expertise of the change\nagent also lies in his or her ability to construct a consensus about which emergent issues are\nimportant before work on those agendas is started. While the behavioural repertoire\nrequired to manage the content and control agendas is relatively straightforward, the skills,\nself-knowledge, emotional resilience etc required for managing agenda creation and the\nprocess agenda itself should be viewed as considerable. Recent research by Atkinson and\nMeldrum (1998) into the quality of management development professionals, as perceived by\nline management, revealed a list of de\u00ae ciencies, if viewed from a change management per-\nspective. Line management was largely either ambivalent or negative about management\ndevelopment professionals in terms of their in\u00af uence in the organisation, their ability to act\nas good role models, their ability to match needs to developmental activities and in terms of\ntheir strategic overview of the business. They also tended to be seen as administrative rather\nthan consultative. This list would suggest that many line managers would perceive that\nMTD professionals are unlikely to be able to demonstrate the competencies needed to con-\nstruct or manage a dif\u00ae cult process agenda. Baddeley and James (1987) provide a descriptive\nmodel of political behaviour classi\u00ae ed according to the degree which individuals are able to\nr`ead\u2019 organisational decision processes, personal agenda, power bases etc and the degree to\nwhich they are interested in psychological game-playing, a concern with oneself at one\nextreme or acting with integrity at the other. This produces four types of political behaviour: \nl Clever: people who are interested in the locus of power; are unprincipled and inner goal-\norientated; are able to manipulate situations so as to appear to never make mistakes;\nknow how the formal and informal organisation works; can recognise and exploit\nweaknesses; and like games of winners and losers.\nl Wise: people who have personal values and ethics; listen well and are aware of others\u2019\nviewpoints; use coalition; know how the formal processes work; get support; and\nnegotiate and strive for win-win situations.\nl Innocent: people who tend to rely on authority; don\u2019t appreciate political purpose; only\nunderstand the content but not the process of procedures; believe that \u00af avours of the\nmonth are here to stay; and believe in expert and position power.\nl Inept: people who also do not recognise political purpose; are inept at making alliances\nand coalitions; try hard to be nice; not tuned into the grapevine; interpersonally unskilled;\nand see things as `either\/or\u2019.\nIn terms of this model, the research from Atkinson and Meldrum (1998) reflects a\nperception from line management that would seem to locate much MTD activity in the last\ntwo `unaware\u2019 categories and would therefore be unlikely to possess the necessary political\nprocess skills needed to initiate substantial change. Buchanan and Boddy (1992) suggest that\nchange agents with low process skills are more likely to excel in l`ow vulnerability\u2019 and l`ow\nhassle\u2019  contexts. These contexts re\u00af ect incremental and peripheral organisational change.\nThis observation is supported from research by Ezzamel et al in their sample of 27\ncompanies, which showed that the `integration of HRM and business strategy was the\nexception\u2019 (1996: 76) and, in Rainbird\u2019s study (1994: 87), that:\nNeither the integration of the training function into other policy areas, nor the\nintegration of employees through their involvement in training programmes,\nhas occurred to any great extent... This would suggest that the implementation\nof HRM has been piecemeal at best. \nThe high order skills required for managing the political agenda of change would have\nseemed to have pushed many MTD professionals, and therefore MTD, into the peripheral\narena in which nothing substantial appears to happen.\nHowever, within HR policies, the role of line management is key in the development of\nappropriate types of behaviour and much MTD activity has been devolved to the line over\nrecent years. Does this improve the chance of meaningful MTD activity? Rainbird\u2019s \u00ae ndings\nre\u00af ect that line managers were often ill-equipped to take on these responsibilities. This has\nbeen supported in more recent work by McGovern et al (1997: 22) which has shown that\ninsuf\u00ae cient institutional reinforcements, managerial short-termism and restructuring reduce\nthe effectiveness of line managers in being able to give time and priority to softer HR activities: \nManagers understood both formally, via performance objectives, and informally,\nthrough the demands of their superiors, that their main priority was the hard stuff \u00b1\nthe numbers... while the softer people management issues were of less signi\u00ae cance. \nGiven this analysis, MTD professionals currently seem unlikely to be able to manage the\ndemanding agendas of change and line managers are overtly encouraged to prioritise in\nfavour of \u00ae nancial targets so that nothing much appears to happen. However, initial analysis\nindicates increasing levels of activity. How can this be accounted for? The management of\norganisational meaning is of particular signi\u00ae cance here.\nLEGITIMISING MTD\nThe importance of ritual and symbolism in organisational life is critical to the management of\nthese meanings, of how what is taken for granted comes to be so (Johnson, 1990). The strong\ninstitutional legitimisation of MTD, through the use of organisational language and ritual,\nongoing rule de\u00ae nition and other symbolic actions, all serve to maintain a shared meaning\nthat something is happening. The arena of MTD is laden with organisational ritual; the\nannual appraisal to identify development needs, the creation of the training and development\nbudget, the end-of-course `happy sheets\u2019 etc all help to create the legitimacy of the MTD\/HR\nrole. The sanctioning of MTD investment by senior management and the appointment of\nMTD professionals imply a commitment to such activity. As Pfeffer (1981) points out, this\nsymbolic action can be often reinforced by `avoiding measurement\u2019 \u00b1  in this case, of MTD\noutcomes \u00b1  and also by what Pfeffer describes as `result uncertainty\u2019. The latter occurs when\nthe de\u00ae nition of satisfaction lies in the hands of those being evaluated or when that which is\nbeing evaluated has complex and multiple attributes. As Cairns (1997) identi\u00ae es, much MTD\nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\n41HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nis not fully evaluated because of the difficulty perceived by MTD\/HR professionals of\nestablishing quanti\u00ae able results, lack of clear objectives, lack of management time etc. In\nCairns\u2019 study, 32 per cent of companies used HR managers to evaluate MTD activities while\n42-49 per cent relied on line managers who, as we have seen, have other priorities. \nSimilarly, changing market conditions help to legitimise the need for new rules of the\ngame. So MTD enacts new initiatives (eg teamworking, IIP, customer focus and process\nthinking), new rules about what is important and `\u00af avours of the month\u2019  which provide\nfurther legitimisation. The role of language is central to the construction of reality, as the\nvehicle through which legitimisation occurs (Pfeffer, 1981). MTD buzzwords, acronyms and\nsuch \u00af avours of the month similarly all contribute to the social construction of a shared\nMTD reality. Within the industry, different actors have different perceptions about the\ninterpretation of these new rules, yet the resulting arguments only serve to further legitimise\nMTD as they do not often re\u00af ect fundamental disagreement over values or beliefs of the\ngame within which they are colluding (Pfeffer, 1981). \nCairns\u2019 (1997) study into MTD evaluation reveals that 65 per cent of respondents did not\nconsistently measure its impact because of difficulties in quantifying results, lack of\nmanagement involvement, lack of clear objectives and lack of tools and time. Avoiding\nassessment of outcomes by controlling information (for example, end-of-course `happy\nsheets\u2019 , which are likely to measure reactions rather than learning) is a critical part of\ncreating a dominant definition of reality (Pfeffer, 1981). It is also a way of creating a\ndominant de\u00ae nition that progress is being made.\nThe impact of such symbolic action goes some way to answering our question as to why\nthere is activity but little outcome. But why should organisational time and resources be\nspent on encouraging this legitimisation of MTD activities and then, both overtly and\ncovertly, indicate other priorities? The cause of much of this apparent contradiction can be\nfound embedded in the key HR myth that `people are our greatest asset\u2019.\nTHE MYTH THAT PEOPLE MATTER\nThe `softer\u2019  people management issues described by McGovern et al (1997) are critical to\nHRM and reflect much of the focus of MTD. Through a process of `developmental\nhumanism\u2019 , which underlies many HR models (McGovern et al, 1997: 27), employees are\nable to make decisions closer to the customer, are able develop their inherent `know-how\u2019\nand use this to become a source of competitive advantage. In this model employees are seen\nas the organisation\u2019s most valuable asset. The quid pro quo is that the organisation becomes a\nplace in which individuals can achieve self-actualisation and develop in the wider\ncommunity of organisational life. This approach sits comfortably with the current vogue of\nknowledge management in which all employees are encouraged to engage in continual\nlearning to develop the l`earning organisation\u2019 . The apparently laudable goal of MTD is\ntherefore to create increased employee awarenes s and to improve the quality of\nmanagement to secure a more effective achievement of organisational goals (Hopfl and\nDawes, 1995). At the same time, managers are able to develop themselves and others, and to\nfeel more enriched, challenged and valued.\nBut in considering these ideas, MTD must be viewed from a critical perspective because it is\nimplicitly concerned with issues of order and predictability in organisational performance\n(Hop\u00af and Dawes, 1995). MTD, sanctioned by senior management, will in its execution con-\nstruct impressions of behaviour and attributes that are needed by managers to be successful in\nany given organisational setting. MTD therefore becomes the advocate and guardian of what-\never behaviour is necessary to achieve organisational goals. It is the assumption of business\nManagement development as a game of meaningless outcomes\n42 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nleaders that t`hey have the right to control management behaviour\u2019 (Ackers and Preston, 1997).\nManagement development programmes therefore become an opportunity for normative\ncontrol (Coopey, 1995) in which managers, by their involvement, in effect indicate vulnerability\nrather than empowered enlightenment (Ackers and Preston, 1997). For many senior managers\nthis may not be necessarily a conscious strategy of manipulation, but perhaps re\u00af ects the over-\nwhelming utilitarianism of organisational life \u00b1  of institutional pressures to meet market expec-\ntations and maximise the return on capital before all other concerns. It re\u00af ects a perspective\nwhich demands that people are seen as extensions of such capital assets (Jones, 1996). This util-\nitarianism has the effect of turning the idea t`hat people are our greatest asset\u2019 into a myth. The\ndiscussion on corporate culture, management competencies and empowerment serves to obs-\ncure more fundamental issues of hegemony and control in organisational life (Coopey, 1995).\nWhen push comes to shove, senior managers will promote the unavoidable economic ration-\nality of their decisions. The rules and the goal of the MTD game are therefore very much rooted\nin a managerialism which mandates the pursuit of economic objectives over social altruism.\nViewing MTD as an agent of normative control provides some insight into why senior\nmanagement might consider it worthwhile to encourage investment in MTD, but also why\nthis encouragement is unlikely to take precedent over more demanding organisational\nissues. But even this perspective would suggest that some progress is made through MTD,\nalbeit that it is used as an agent of manipulation. Its use in this way is seemingly contrary to\nHR philosophy but certainly one which would encourage the increasing investment that\nMTD attracts. However, introductory analysis suggested that while there was much activity\nin MTD, there was actually little progress. This aspect of MTD brings us to the question of\nhow the rules of the MTD game are interpreted by the players involved.\nPLAYING THE GAME\nThe ef\u00ae cacy of imposed, top-down change aimed at inculcating new organisational values\nand cultures has been a subject of considerable debate over recent years (see Willmott, 1993\nin particular). This area has fuelled much of the work of MTD as companies have issued\nvalue statements, developed competency frameworks and cascaded teamworking\nprogrammes. But research (Beer et al, 1990; Hope and Hendry, 1995) casts doubt on the\neffectiveness of these approaches in instilling real behaviour change, as individuals wrestle\nwith the constant interplay between the embracement (acceptance) and distancing (rejection)\nof new roles (Kunda, 1992). Other research from Dopson and Neumann (1994) into the\nreaction of middle managers to changing psychological contracts found that managers saw\nattempts to change attitudes through MTD as a `sop\u2019, lacking relevance and credibility.\nResearch by Denham et al (1996) into the responses of managers to the introduction of\nempowerment initiatives  indicates how managers  learn to `surface act\u2019  to senior\nmanagement while adapting policies to suit themselves and their teams. All of these studies\npoint to the increasing managerial cynicism which meets many MTD initiatives inside\norganisations. Managers, in effect, have come to see the work of much MTD as a `socially\nconstructed\u2019 game that needs to be played in order to survive and prosper in their organ-\nisations. Ezzamel et al (1996) provide a classic example of such a perspective from a manager\nwho had declined an invitation to attend a team-building weekend and who saw compliance\nwith the behavioural requirements of a new culture as a cynical exercise. `These guys have\nbeen here for 15 years and they have hardly done a day\u2019s work in their life, but they have\nplayed the political game\u2019  (1996: 73). The 1998 British Psychological Society conference\nwarned that the battle for the self had begun as organisations attempted to manipulate\nemotions and loyalty. As John Arnold of Loughborough University put it (Welch, 1998): \nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\n43HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nManagement development as a game of meaningless outcomes\n44 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nWe are starting to question just how much of that sense of self we are prepared\nto put into, or change for, work. Are people prepared to ring-fence certain \nself-perceptions in order to survive?  \nIn order to ring-fence such `perceptions\u2019, an illusion of meaningful `busyness\u2019 is created in\nwhich employees interpret the rules and consciously participate in the game to secure\nidentities, promotions, more challenging work, the continuation of a quiet life etc, but also to\navoid the personal dysfunctions resulting from imposed behaviour change. Investment\ncontinues to be made and sanctioned by senior management because to do anything other\nwould clearly reveal the idea that `people are our greatest asset\u2019 as a myth. The idea thus\nbecomes another myth to add to the book of management fables.\nThe rules of the MTD game are therefore very much interpreted through a lens of self-inter-\nest. According to Ezzamel et al (1996: 73), this in turn helps create a collective reality in which:\nA capacity to play the political game may often count for more than a capacity and\nwillingness to work effectively. Instead of remedying ineffectiveness, HRM-type\npolicies and the strengthening of corporate culture may simply act to conceal and\npromote political game-playing in novel ways. \nMTD has become trapped in its own game, caught in a vicious cycle in which further invest-\nment exacerbates the problem. In the bid to create more competitive organisations, soft HR app-\nroaches which promote involvement, empowerment etc have developed to allow managers to\nembed a more effective alignment of people resources. This t`ruth, trust, love and collaboration\u2019\napproach to change (Buchanan and Boddy, 1992) helps create the ritual and symbolism that\nhelps legitimise the MTD agenda, and this creates much of its business. Yet, either because MTD\nprofessionals lack credibility, and\/or that, in a capitalist work organisation, the company will\nalways place \u00ae nancial objectives ahead of people development, line management receive mixed\nmessages about what is important. Managers respond with public acceptance but private\nrejection of the messages contained within MTD interventions , in order to ring-fence\npsychological needs for the preservation of self. The public acceptance stimulates more\ninvestment by senior management, thus promulgating the myth that people matter. The game is\nplayed and the actors participate, playing the game that everyone pretends has value because it\nis in their interests to do so, to create promotions, obtain security, avoid redundancy and so on.\nFrom this examination it seems unlikely, given the political environment in which it oper-\nates, and indeed unconsciously exacerbates, that MTD is able to break out of its own parad-\nigm. What then of the prospect of change? In Willmott\u2019s (1994) analysis of publicly-funded\nmanagement education, the way forward is seen to be through the application of action learn-\ning coupled with critical theory. But even Willmott (1994: 131) believes that the prospect of\nchange within publicly-funded management education through critical action learning is\nunlikely to gain a warm reception. Similarly, if the opportunity for change from within organ-\nisations is equally restrained by a never ending game of self-interest, then perhaps we should\nask ourselves: why bother to attempt change at all? Is there anything that can be realistically\ndone to change the situation? The \u00ae nal part of this article will discuss these two key questions.\nA WAY FORWARD?\nOne of the consequences of the current HR philosophy of valuing people as an organisation\u2019s\ngreatest asset is an undiscriminating approach to the development of people, insomuch that\nthe knowledge of all employees is seen as a potential source of competitive advantage.\nPractitioner journals are full of descriptions about how to truly harness the power of people\nassets by organisations becoming vessels for never-ending personal development in which\nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\n45HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nall employees continually add to their stock of marketable know-how. Given the kinds of\ninstitutional and psychological motives described above, is this possible or even desirable?\nFor example, there are clearly employees who feel pressurised to develop themselves when\nall they want is a more simple relationship with their employer. There are those who will see\ntheir employer as a vehicle for entirely self-serving development, and there are those who\nwill be allegedly valued but will be the \u00ae rst to go when \u00ae nancial performance does not meet\nmarket expectations \u00b1  when reality does not match rhetoric. An undiscriminating approach\nto the valuing of people as exemplif ied by much current MTD activity further fuels\nemployee cynicism, creates unrealistic expectations of what could be delivered by\norganisations in terms of socially-responsible behaviour and undermines other laudable\nattempts at securing employee trust. Nor is this just an issue for individual organisations.\nThe power and influence of organisations in our society today is pre-eminent and\ntherefore the impact of managerial culture (the core beliefs, values and meanings which\nunderpin the contemporary management of organisations) on all aspects of our lives is\nextremely pervasive. Consequently the impact of MTD as a guardian of such managerialism\nhas a signi\u00ae cance on our lives well beyond the classroom. But this managerialism is founded\non a technical rationality, economy and effectiveness which, when exercised through MTD,\ntends to suppress issues of values, choices and interests (Coopey, 1995). Managerialism,\nsupported by MTD, is failing to provide the purposeful meaning we as human beings need\nand seek and is often serving to the detriment of human interests (Bowles, 1997). The wider\nsocial effects of an undiscriminating approach to the management of people are therefore\nsubstantial. MTD must therefore be elevated beyond pursuing meaningless outcomes. There\nis a lot to be `bothered\u2019 about in the way that MTD is currently enacted within organisations.\nBut how can we manage to deliver increasing value from MTD in the future without simply\nbeing undiscriminating in its use? If people and their development are more important than\never before for the future effectiveness of organisations, and we are not to simplistically value\nemployees in an undiscriminating way that ultimately generates mistrust and cynicism, then\none option is to look for managers who can take a discriminating and critically-re\u00af ective view\nabout the employment of people. We must be able to develop managers who can differentiate\nwhen it might be important to value people for organisational effectiveness and when to value\nthem for reasons of social responsibility. In effect we return to the territory of Willmott\u2019s critical\naction learning but with change being stimulated from within organisations, by MTD.\nMTD could be used to encourage managers to explore the nature of their relationship\nwith their organisation and, in doing so, to raise issues of control to the surface (Hop\u00af and\nDawes, 1995). But who will do this? Our analysis so far would suggest that there can be only\na small minority of MTD professionals who are capable of such potentially subversive act-\nion. For a minority to be influential, it needs to be active, and perceived as confident,\ncompetent, coherent and distinctive (Moscovici, 1976). However, as we have seen, this desc-\nription is not likely to be applied to MTD professionals by a line management majority and\ntherefore unlikely to be in\u00af uential on its own (Mugny et al, 1984). Greater initial impact may\nbe made through the development of line managers themselves who are perceived to be\npart of the majority and therefore able to exert in\u00af uence from within (Mugny et al, 1984).\nThose of us involved in management education and MTD, who have a unique opportunity\nto both challenge and work inside organisations, could be providing companies with a more\nsophisticated development process for managers than anticipated by sponsors. This would\nconsciously and deliberately raise the awareness of line managers about the rules of the\ngame in which they are operating (Johnson et al, 1997) and the fact that these rules are soc-\nially constructed and open to rede\u00ae nition. While this subversive approach may seem unlike-\nly to succeed, given the forgone analysis of institutionalised power relations, it may be\nusefully tied to a substantial and emerging organisational need.\nManagement development as a game of meaningless outcomes\n46 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\nThe requirement to develop organisations that can build on employee know-how and can\ninnovate and respond to ever-increasing change (Miles et al, 1997) `implies a fundamental\nreconceptualisation of the underlying management philosophy\u2019 (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1997:\n12). This realisation similarly requires a fundamentally different approach to organisation dev-\nelopment. In response to many years of failed organisation change initiatives (Beer et al, 1990),\nrecent attention has been given to developing the idea of `pockets of good practice\u2019 within\norganisations as an effective approach to creating the emergent, organic change required in\nthe future (Beer et al, 1990; Butcher et al, 1997; Frohman, 1997; Hendry, 1996). Such pockets are\nalso necessarily subversive, achieving a balance between maintaining internal cohesion, being\norganisationally credible in terms of differentiated performance and managing the political\nenvironment. Through linked communities of good practice, `knowledge, rules for action and\nculture are spread\u2019 (Hendry, 1996: 628). By focusing on the development of key individuals,\norganisational change can be created from within rather than top-down (Butcher et al, 1997).\nThe ability of managers to engage in this type of activity requires considerable re\u00af ective\nthinking, self-knowledge and personal in\u00af uence, requiring us to move far beyond a restrictive\nand simplistic competency framework (Antonacopoulou and Fitzgerald, 1996) to develop man-\nagers as whole human beings acting in a socially complex and ever-changing environment\n(Brown, 1993; Butcher et al, 1997). Furthermore, to create greater degrees of social responsibility:\n[Development processes must reflect that managers] have other and wider\nresponsibilities, as citizens, members of local communities etc. Their decisions\ndo not just affect the performance of the company for which they work for but\ncan have major effects on the quality and quantity of life enjoyed by virtually all\nmembers of society and, increasingly, the planet.\nWillmott, 1994: 110\nIs this possible? Like Willmott, I am pessimistic but I do believe progress can occur within a\ncapitalist work organisation (1994: 130). If we can map issues of social responsibility onto the\nexisting terrain of management development by embedding these ideas into agendas which\nare meaningful and pragmatic for practising managers, then perhaps change might be\ninitiated from below. From a critical perspective, it might be argued that managers will always\nbe prevented from taking non-instrumental, socially-responsible action by organisational con-\ntrol systems which ensure that managers act in accordance with the organisation\u2019s long-term\neconomic interests. However, this assumes that such managerial action will be taken without a\nclear view of t`he true nature of the game in which they \u00ae nd themselves\u2019 (Jones, 1996: 22). \nOnce again, the central issue is one of exposing the rules of the game. In this regard, recent\nwork by Butcher et al (1997) and Clarke (1998), into the development of general managers on\na portfolio of public programmes, has shown the effectiveness of a development process\nwhich tightly integrates new managerial knowledge with personal development. Personal\ndevelopment is designed to trigger a discontinuity (Conger and Xin, 1996) in existing mental\nmodels and initiate a transformational cycle (Quinn, 1988). Because this process is embedded\nin real world managerial issues, participants are able to make step changes in a number of\nkey `meta-abilities\u2019 ; these are important because they underpin and determine how and\nwhen knowledge, skills and competencies are used. For example, one of these meta-abilities\nconcerns the area of cognitive \u00af exibility and complexity: being able to be critical of what is\nhappening around you, and being able to notice and interpret con\u00af icting agendas. This is\nessential in being able to read the rules of the game. While the development of such meta-\nabilities is still relatively new, early indications suggest that this may be a meaningful future\ndirection for MTD activity to enable it to surface issues of control and social responsibility.\nSuch developments will not happen without the academic community moving beyond\nscholarly debate and the pursuit of research gradings (Willmott, 1994). It needs to take a\nMartin Clarke, Cran\u00ae eld School of Management\n47HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT JOURNAL \u00b1  VOL 9 NO 2\ngreater degree of social responsibility for its own actions if it is to encourage managers to be\n`strategic termites\u2019 (Morgan, 1993: 41). These may only be possible through organisationally-\ninitiated MTD delivered through university business schools, with greater opportunities for\ngenerating critical re\u00af ective thinking among managers with power and in\u00af uence to make a\ndifference through the creation of pockets of good practice. By also working with MTD\nprofessionals themselves, we can initiate a critical dialogue about the potential value of MTD\nto develop managers who can take a discriminating and socially-responsible approach to\npeople development. This in turn may engender a real insight about the potentially signif-\nicant organisational and social role of MTD. However, much of the industry is run through\nprivate enterprise and pro\u00ae ts enormously from the current `game\u2019; they will accordingly\nresist attempts to change the rules. This places an even greater emphasis on `educators\u2019 to\nchallenge existing MTD practices and providers, perhaps by investing equal amounts of time\nworking and communicating in a meaningful language with line managers in companies and\npractitioner magazines as we do in academic journals. A valuable impact could also be made\nby challenging the rules at practitioner rather than academic conferences, where much\nlegitimisation of new approaches begins; these also provide an opportunity to present realistic\nalternatives to current practice. Perhaps educators need to raise the stakes by lobbying for\nmore sophisticated quali\u00ae cation standards within the industry that move us beyond another\nreductionist competency framework; you need a licence to own a dog but not to run a\ntraining consultancy. Those of us in management education who are also involved in MTD\nwithin organisations thus need to play a role in undermining the assumptions and values that\ncreate the rules of the game and that, through our inaction, we implicitly participate.\nParadoxically therefore, MTD could become extremely influential as a catalyst for\norganisational (and social) change, but this would require those involved to reveal their own\nineffectiveness and to expose that we have been trapped in the same game. It would also\nrequire us to create our own `pockets of good practice\u2019 in order that we are seen as active,\ncompetent, coherent and distinctive. In order to encourage this perception, those of us\ninvolved in management education and development should be forcing a new seriousness\namong managers about critical questions such as: organisational effectiveness for whom?;\nef\u00ae ciency for what purpose?; and competition to what end?\nSUMMARY\nMuch has been written about the potential role of MTD in helping to secure greater\nemployee autonomy and quality of working life but, despite the promise, it has failed to\nreally meet these expectations. Using a political game-playing perspective, this article has\nshown how within a capitalist framework the social and psychological needs and survival\ninstincts of organisational actors create a vicious cycle of inactivity. MTD provides a complex\ngame in which roles and actions can be organisationally justi\u00ae ed, but in doing so helps to\ngenerate a myth that is detrimental both to organisational morale and individual well-being.\nFuture organisational success \u00b1  however that might be measured \u00b1  seems to hinge on the\nability of companies to harness the contribution of people in a socially responsible way\nwhich does not resort to laudable yet naive humanist motives which obscure the real issues\nof power and control. Ironically, it is MTD itself which could be most effective in initiating\nchange, but to do this professionals will have to expose themselves as part of the game they\nwish to change. Creating change from within existing organisational power relations may be\nachieved by creating pockets of good, socially responsible managerial practice. There are\nsome limited, early signs that progress may be possible in raising the awareness of these\ntype of issues among practising managers (Clarke 1998; Butcher et al, 1997). The enormity of\nthe task should be no justi\u00ae cation for inaction.\nREFERENCES\nAckers, P. and Preston, D. 1997. `Born again?
