Fear of hypoglycemia is a \nmajor barrier to initiating insulin therapy. The AT.LANTUS study investigated optimal \nmethods to initiate and maintain insulin glargine (LANTUS\u00ae; glargine) therapy using two \ntreatment algorithms. This sub-group analysis investigated the initiation of once-daily \nglargine therapy in patients sub-optimally controlled on multiple OADs. \nResearch design and methods: This was a 24-week, multinational (59 countries), \nmulticenter (611), randomized study. Algorithm 1 was a clinic-driven titration and Algorithm 2 \nwas a patient-driven titration. Titration was based on target fasting blood glucose \u2264100 \nmg\/dL (\u22645.5 mmol\/L). Algorithms were compared for incidence of severe hypoglycemia \n(requiring assistance and blood glucose <50 mg\/dL [<2.8 mmol\/L]) and baseline-to-endpoint \nchange in HbA1c. \nResults: Of the 4961 patients enrolled in the study, 865 were included in this sub-group \nanalysis: 340 received glargine plus 1 OAD; 525 received glargine plus >1 OAD. Incidence \nof severe hypoglycemia was <1%. HbA1c decreased significantly between baseline and \nendpoint for patients receiving glargine plus 1 OAD (\u20131.4%, p<0.001; Algorithm 1 \u20131.3% vs \nAlgorithm 2 \u20131.5%; p=0.03) and glargine plus >1 OAD (\u20131.7%, p<0.001; Algorithm 1 \u20131.5% \nvs Algorithm 2 \u20131.8%; p=0.001). \nConclusions: This study shows that initiation of once-daily glargine with OADs results in \nsignificant reduction of HbA1c with a low risk of hypoglycemia. The greater reduction in HbA1c \nwas seen in patients randomized to the patient-driven algorithm (Algorithm 2) on one or \nmore than one OAD.  \n 3\nAchieving and maintaining tight glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes is essential \nto delay progression of micro- and macrovascular complications [1]. Targets for HbA1c have \nbeen set as <7.0%, 6.5\u20137.5% and <6.5% by the American Diabetes Association [2], National \nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK [3] and the International Diabetes \nFederation [4], respectively. However, the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are \nunable to reach target HbA1c levels [5,6].  \n \nFollowing diagnosis, patients are generally advised to make a number of lifestyle changes, \nfocussed on increasing physical activity levels [7] and diet [8]. However, such programs are \nusually insufficient by this stage of the diabetes [9]. The progressive nature of T2DM, \ncharacterized by a decline in \u03b2-cell function [10,11] and deterioration in glycemic control [12], \nmeans that pharmacologic interventions are usually required [13]. Oral antidiabetic agents \n(OADs), for example, sulfonylureas, metformin and glitazones are therapeutic interventions \nused in monotherapy or in combination. However, to achieve and maintain good glycemic \ncontrol, OADs, even in combination, are insufficient [14] and insulin therapy is often required \n[13].  \n \nBoth patients and physicians may be reluctant to start insulin therapy [6,15,16]. The fear of \nhypoglycemia, needle anxiety and weight gain are among the reasons cited that actively \ndiscourage insulin therapy. Therefore, it is important that for insulin therapy to be effective in \npatients with type 2 diabetes, these barriers must be overcome. \n \nInsulin glargine (LANTUS\u00ae, glargine) is the first clinically available basal analog with no \npronounced peak in activity and a 24-hour duration of action following once-daily \nadministration [17]. In type 2 diabetes, insulin glargine has at least equivalent glycemic \ncontrol [18-20] with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin [20-25]. \nTherefore, insulin glargine could potentially be used as part of a more intensive treatment \nregimen to achieve target HbA1c levels \u22647% with a lower risk of hypoglycemia. Combination \n 4\ntherapy of insulin glargine in conjunction with one or more OADs is an effective and simple \nregimen in patients with type 2 diabetes who have sub-optimal control on OADs alone \n[26,27].  \n \nWhilst little is known regarding the optimal titration regimen for initiating basal insulin \ntherapy, the Treat-to-Target study [25] demonstrated that aggressive titration, in the context \nof an intensive and fully resourced clinical trial setting, can result in ~60% of patients \nachieving target HbA1c of \u22647%.  \n \nWe recently showed that two treatment algorithms, one largely clinic-driven and the other \nprimarily patient-driven, can be introduced to a large cohort of subjects [28]. Given the large-\nscale nature of the AT.LANTUS study (59 countries, 4961 patients) and the diversity of prior \ntreatment, it has been possible to perform a number of post hoc sub-analyses on different \nsub-populations. One of the most likely clinical contexts in which basal insulin is initiated in \ntype 2 diabetes is in those with sub-optimal glycaemic control on OADs; thus, results in this \nparticular sub-group are of particular relevance. Here we report the findings of a sub-group \nanalysis of insulin-na\u00efve patients sub-optimally controlled with OADs who took part in the \nAT.LANTUS study.  \n \n 5\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \nStudy design \nThis was a prospective, multinational (611 centers in 59 countries in Western and Eastern \nEurope, South America, Asia and Africa\/Middle East), randomized controlled, parallel-design \nstudy of 24 weeks duration of 4961 type 2 diabetes patients. This study included only four \nmandatory clinical visits, similar to standard clinical practice. All patients gave informed \nconsent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study was performed in \naccordance with Good Clinical Practice. Full details are available elsewhere [28]. \n \nInclusion criteria for the total population [28] included: subjects aged \u226518 years on \nantidiabetic treatment (any oral and\/or insulin therapy) for >6 months; HbA1c levels >7.0% \nand <12.0%; body mass index (BMI) values <40 kg\/m2 and a willingness to perform self-\nmonitored blood glucose. Additional sub-group analysis criteria included insulin-na\u00efve \npatients sub-optimally controlled with >1 OAD. Exclusion criteria were in accordance with the \nmanufacturer\u2019s prescribing information. \n \nIn this paper we discuss the sub-group analysis of subjects who were previously taking only \nOADs. At baseline, subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive insulin glargine according to \nAlgorithm 1 (clinic-driven titration) or Algorithm 2 (patient-driven titration) (Table 1).  \n \n[Table 1 near here] \n \nAt baseline, the investigator decided whether to continue each OAD, in line with the \nprescribing information. Once it was decided whether the subject should take one or >1 \nOAD, the dose of OAD(s) remained fixed and stable for the duration of the study. As \nthiazolidinediones were not licensed for use in combination with insulin at the time this study \nwas conducted, for any patients using a thiazolidinedione during screening, the investigators \nwere asked to switch therapy, in line with the prescribing information. \n 6\n Objectives  \nThe primary objective of the full study was to compare the two treatment algorithms for the \ninitiation and maintenance of insulin glargine based on the incidence of severe \nhypoglycemia, defined according to criteria used in the Diabetes Control and Complications \nTrial (DCCT) [29,30]. \n \nThe primary outcome measure for this sub-group analysis was the comparison between \nalgorithms for the incidence of severe, symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Secondary \noutcomes included glycemic control (HbA1c and fasting blood glucose [FBG]) and change in \ninsulin dose from baseline. The study endpoint was defined by the subject\u2019s last observation \n(Visit 12 for those completing the study, or last clinic for those missing data on Visit 12). If a \nsubject discontinued treatment permanently before the planned study end, the last \nevaluation before discontinuation was considered for the endpoint analysis.  \n \nMeasurements and safety \nAt screening, biochemistry and hematology measurements were taken. HbA1c and weight \nwere measured at screening, baseline and Weeks 12 and 24. Analyses of HbA1c were \nperformed by the laboratory of each participating site, either according to the DCCT standard \nmethod or a DCCT-aligned method within a documented quality controlled system. FBG \nlevels on 6 consecutive days before and on the day of a visit were measured by subjects \nweekly from baseline to Week 24. Glucose monitors were provided for self-monitored blood \nglucose. The glucose meters used a standardized platform for the entire study and reported \nresults in whole blood. Data and calibration of blood glucose meters was verified at clinical \nvisits. \n \n 7\nSafety assessments in each treatment algorithm included adverse event (AE) reporting, \nexcluding the primary and secondary outcomes. All AEs, including non-treatment emergent \nAEs were recorded.  \n \nStatistical methods \nThe statistical and reporting methods used in this sub-analysis were similar to those used in \nthe main AT.LANTUS study [28]. In the full study population, the primary efficacy variable \n(frequency of severe hypoglycemia) was evaluated using a two-sided 90% confidence \ninterval (CI) with equivalence declared if the 90% CI was contained in the pre-defined \nequivalence boundaries (\u20131.5; 1.5%). For analyses presented here, patients treated at \nbaseline with more than one OAD were isolated and a descriptive analysis produced. \nAnalyses were performed for two subgroups defined according to the number of OADs \nreceived at randomization (one or more than one OAD), and who remained on the same \ntreatment regimen throughout the study. All analyses presented here were performed on an \nexploratory basis. The analyses were undertaken on non-randomized sub-groups of patients \nwithout adjustment for multiple testing, and were based on the per-protocol population. \nChanges from baseline in HbA1c, FBG, body weight and insulin dose were analysed using \nanalysis of covariance. Student\u2019s t-test and the chi-square test were also used as \nappropriate. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses \nwere performed using SAS version 8 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC). \n \nRESULTS \nResults of independent audits performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice \nconcluded that the trial data was reliable, verifiable and retrievable. The results from the full \nstudy population (n=4961) can be found elsewhere [28]. A total of 865 subjects with type 2 \ndiabetes, previously sub-optimally controlled on multiple OADs were included in this sub-\ngroup analysis; of these patients, 340 received insulin glargine plus 1 OAD and 525 received \ninsulin glargine plus >1 OAD (intention-to-treat population of this sub-group). Of patients \n 8\nreceiving 1 OAD, 316 (170 Algorithm 1 and 146 Algorithm 2) completed the study to form the \nper-protocol population; reasons for discontinuation, Algorithm 1 versus Algorithm 2, were \npatient not followed to final visit (4 vs 8 subjects) and major protocol violations (6 vs 6 \nsubjects). In patients receiving >1 OAD, 499 (256 Algorithm 1 and 243 Algorithm 2) \ncompleted the study to form the per-protocol population; reasons for discontinuation, \nAlgorithm 1 versus Algorithm 2, were patient not followed to final visit (5 vs 7 subjects) and \nmajor protocol violations (8 vs 6 subjects).  \n \nSubject demographics and baseline characteristics were broadly similar between the two \ntreatment groups and within each algorithm, although patients in the >1 OAD treatment \ngroup tended to have a longer duration of OAD treatment compared with patients in the 1 \nOAD treatment group (Table 2).  \n \n[Table 2 near here] \n \nWhile data presented are based on the per-protocol analysis, full intention-to-treat analyses \nwere performed. The results were virtually identical and, therefore, did not differ clinically or \nstatistically and are not presented here. \n \nHypoglycemia  \nThe incidence of severe, symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients receiving \ninsulin glargine via either treatment algorithm plus either 1 OAD or >1 OAD is summarised in \nTable 3. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia was <1% in both treatment groups, with no \nsignificant difference between the treatment algorithms. \n \n[Table 3 near here]  \n \n 9\nHbA1c \nIn subjects receiving insulin glargine plus 1 OAD, there was a significant baseline to \nendpoint decrease in HbA1c in both algorithms (Figure 1A). Algorithm 2 was associated with \na greater reduction compared with Algorithm 1 (\u20131.5 vs \u20131.3%; p=0.03). Significant \nreductions in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint were also observed in patients receiving \ninsulin glargine plus >1 OAD in both algorithms (Figure 1A). Algorithm 2 was associated with \na greater reduction compared with Algorithm 1 (\u20131.8 vs \u20131.5%; p=0.001). \n \nAt endpoint, in subjects receiving insulin glargine plus 1 OAD, 24% had reached target \nHbA1c levels \u22647% with Algorithm 1 compared with 38% of subjects with Algorithm 2 \n(p=0.009) and in subjects receiving insulin glargine plus >1 OAD, 31% had reached target \nHbA1c levels \u22647% with Algorithm 1 compared with 43% of subjects with Algorithm 2 \n(p=0.007). Significantly more subjects achieved HbA1c levels \u22647% without experiencing \neither severe or nocturnal hypoglycemia in Algorithm 2 versus Algorithm 1 in subjects \nreceiving both insulin glargine plus 1 OAD (33 vs 21%; p=0.02) and insulin glargine plus >1 \nOAD (37 vs 28%; p=0.03).  \n \n[Figure 1 near here] \n \nFasting blood glucose  \nFBG decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint in all sub-groups (p<0.001; Figure \n1B), but the reduction in FBG was significantly greater for subjects randomized to Algorithm \n2 compared with Algorithm 1 for subjects receiving insulin glargine plus 1 OAD (\u201379.1\u00b155.3 \n[4.4\u00b13.1 mmol\/L] vs 63.6\u00b151.7 mg\/dL [3.5\u00b12.9 mmol\/L], p=0.001) and subjects receiving \ninsulin glargine plus >1 OAD (79.6\u00b148.3 [4.4\u00b12.7 mmol\/L] vs \u201366.6\u00b151.6 [3.7\u00b12.9 mmol\/L], \np<0.001). \n \n 10\nInsulin glargine dose  \nFor patients receiving 1 OAD, the increases in insulin dose were significantly greater for \npatients randomized to Algorithm 2 (+33.9 U; range: \u20138 to +128 U [+0.39 U\/kg]) compared \nwith Algorithm 1 (+27.4 U, p=0.04; range: \u20132 to +104 U [+0.32 U\/kg, p=0.03]; Figure 1C). For \npatients receiving >1 OAD, the increases in insulin dose were not significantly different in the \npatients randomized to Algorithm 1 (+19.9 U; range: \u20136 to +100 U [+0.23 U\/kg]) or Algorithm \n2 (+22.8 U, p=0.57; range: \u201316 to +114 U [+0.27 U\/kg, p=0.20]; Figure 1C). \n \nBody weight \nIn subjects receiving both 1 OAD and >1 OAD, there was a modest statistically significant \n(p<0.001) increase in body weight from baseline to endpoint with both Algorithm 1 \n(81.2\u00b115.5 to 82.8\u00b115.9 [mean change: +1.6\u00b13.3] kg and 81.3\u00b116.5 to 83.2\u00b116.8 [+1.9\u00b13.5] \nkg, respectively) and Algorithm 2 (82.1\u00b115.3 to 83.5\u00b115.5 [+1.4\u00b13.4] kg and 78.5\u00b115.7 to \n80.6\u00b116.2 [+2.1\u00b13.3] kg, respectively). There was no significant difference in weight change \nbetween algorithms. \n \nSafety \nIn the main study, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48.7% of patients; \ntheir overall frequency was similar between the algorithms [28]. In this sub-group analysis, \nthe incidence of adverse events was similar to that of the main study (data not shown). \n \n 11\nCONCLUSIONS \nThe AT.LANTUS study is one of the largest randomized clinical studies (n=4961 patients) of \nglycemic management performed in subjects with type 2 diabetes, and the results will be \napplicable to many patients in a clinical setting [28]. This sub-group analysis, undertaken in \n865 subjects, included all insulin-na\u00efve patients who were previously sub-optimally controlled \non multiple OADs. The results presented here demonstrate that two simple insulin initiation \nand treatment algorithms were highly effective in safely achieving and maintaining glycemic \ncontrol. Furthermore, these results were achieved regardless of concomitant OAD therapy \n(+1 OAD or >1 OAD) along with a very low incidence of severe hypoglycemia. \n \nWe have previously published results from the overall population; changes in HbA1c were \u2013\n1.08 and \u20131.22% for Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively [28]. Meanwhile, in this sub-group \nanalysis, patient-driven titration of insulin dose achieved the greater improvement in HbA1c \n(+1 OAD: \u20131.5%; >1 OAD: \u20131.8%) compared with physician-driven titration (+1 OAD: \u20131.3%; \n>1 OAD: \u20131.5%). We also show that patient-driven titration of basal insulin with multiple \nOAD therapy is associated with the greatest improvement in HbA1c without an increased risk \nof symptomatic hypoglycemia. In separate sub-group analyses, initiation of insulin glargine \nachieved reductions of 0.8\u20130.9% in HbA1c for patients previously on NPH insulin [31] and \n1.5% for patients previously on twice-daily premixed insulin plus OADs [32].  \n \nThe fears of weight gain and hypoglycemia are significant barriers to the initiation of insulin \ntherapy in type 2 diabetes [15,33]. In this sub-group analysis, weight gain was relatively \nmodest (range: 1.4\u20132.1 kg over 24 weeks) in the context of significant improvement in \nglycemic control with 24\u201343% of patients reaching target HbA1c levels of \u22647.0%. This \noccurred with a comparatively low incidence of severe hypoglycemia. Furthermore, these \nbenefits were seen regardless of concomitant OAD therapy. Therefore, therapy with basal \ninsulin glargine plus OADs may provide the impetus to overcome the fears of hypoglycemia \nand weight gain. \n 12\n In our study, no patients in the insulin glargine +1 OAD group experienced severe \nhypoglycemia and <1% of the patients in the >1 OAD group experienced severe \nhypoglycemia, which compares favorably with that reported by the UK Prospective Diabetes \nStudy (UKPDS; 2.3% for patients treated with insulin) [34]. Furthermore, our study was of \npatients with long-standing type 2 diabetes, with a mean duration since diagnosis of 10 \nyears and mean duration of OAD therapy of >7 years, whereas the UKPDS included only \nnewly diagnosed (insulin and OAD na\u00efve) patients.  \n \nIn the Treat-To-Target trial [25], which used a forced titration schedule with doses monitored \nby clinical staff, 36.2% of patients achieved a target HbA1c of \u22647.0% without an episode of \ndocumented nocturnal hypoglycemia. In our study, a similar proportion of patients achieved \nthe target HbA1c of \u22647.0% without experiencing nocturnal hypoglycemia. The proportion of \npatients who achieved target HbA1c without experiencing hypoglycemia was statistically \nsuperior in the patient-driven titration group, regardless of concomitant OAD therapy (28.3 \nand 37.3% for patients in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, respectively; intent-to-treat \npopulation). This occurred in conjunction with larger reductions in HbA1c (1.9 vs 1.6%; intent-\nto-treat population). Furthermore, the patients in our study had a lower rate of hypoglycemia \nwithout including unlicensed thiazolidinedione use. In our study, the exclusion of \nthiazolidinediones may have limited the proportion of patients who achieved target HbA1c \n(\u22647%). In the past, and increasingly now, thiazolidinediones in combination with insulin have \ndemonstrated good reductions in HbA1c in type 2 diabetes [25,35,36]. A further reason for \nthe lower proportion of patients reaching HbA1c <7% is that we did not force the titration of \ninsulin glargine, whereas the Treat-to-Target study did. As a result, the rates of \nhypoglycemia were lower in our study. This suggests that titration of insulin glargine dose \ncould be more aggressive, to better reach treatment targets, although this must be balanced \nagainst the inevitable risk of hypoglycemia.  \n \n 13\nWhile a shortcoming of the current study may be the lack of a placebo arm, the reduction in \nHbA1c (>1%) observed in this study is greater than might be expected as a result of a \nplacebo effect.  \n \nThe patients included in this analysis had relatively long-standing Type 2 diabetes (>9 years) \nand HbA1c >9% on average. It is evident that a change in therapy was warranted. The \naddition of once daily basal insulin to their oral antidiabetic regimen allowed led to clinically \nimportant improvements in glycemic control (including HbA1c and FBG) with low risk of \nhypoglycemia. Nevertheless, a number of patients had HbA1c levels above the \nrecommended levels (i.e., \u22647%). One option would be to use a more aggressive titration \nregimen, which may have increased the proportion of subjects achieving target HbA1c \u22647%, \nas in the LANMET study [21], which is discussed below. Alternatively, the addition of one or \nseveral doses of a rapid-acting insulin at mealtime to the therapeutic regimen may be \nwarranted for those patients who were not reaching target HbA1c levels once the basal \ninsulin dose is fully optimized. Indeed, such an approach was also suggested in the \nAmerican Diabetes Association\/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus \nstatement [37]. Nevertheless, this concept will need objective testing. \n \nA further shortcoming of the present study, is that it was conducted as an exploratory \nanalysis of a large sub-group (n=865) of patients from the original AT.LANTUS study \n(n=4961 patients). As such, the analyses were mainly descriptive. However, as a large \nproportion of patients from the original study were included in the analyses presented here \nand that the analysis includes a similar number of patients used in trials such as the Treat to \nTarget study [25], one would expect that the results show a high degree of statistical power \nand support the need for confirmatory studies.  \n \nWhilst additional prospective randomized studies may be necessary to further confirm the \nresults reported, it is evident that the current sub-analysis confirms the results of the Treat to \n 14\nTarget study. The distinguishing feature here is that patient-driven titration appears to \nachieve greater HbA1c benefits with more patients reaching target HbA1c at endpoint, twice \nthe percentage of patients reaching target FBG (72% vs 36%) and a lower incidence of \nsevere hypoglycemia, all in the absence of the use of thiazolidinediones. \n \nPhysicians currently face a number of options for transferring patients from combination \nOAD therapy to insulin, including multiple daily or basal injections and whether to continue or \nchange OAD therapy. In a recent meta-analysis [38] of four trials comparing insulin glargine \nwith NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes [22,24,25,39], insulin glargine was \nassociated with significantly lower incidence of hypoglycemia in conjunction with improved \nHbA1c and this occurred despite similar increases in dose from baseline to endpoint (20\u201328 \nweeks) from 21 to 38 U for insulin glargine and 21 to 37 U for NPH insulin. The relative \nmerits of twice-daily premixed insulin versus once-daily basal insulin are often debated. One \nstudy has shown that once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin was more effective at \nlowering HbA1c than a twice-daily premixed insulin regimen, but a criticism was that \nmetformin was discontinued in the premixed insulin arm, and a conventional premixed \ninsulin was used [40]. In comparison, in two studies, where OADs were continued and \ncomparing biphasic analog mixtures (Lispro Mix 75\/25 or Aspart Mix 70\/30) with insulin \nglargine, the premixed insulin regimens were associated with greater reductions in HbA1c \n[35,41]. However, the premixed insulin regimens were also associated with significantly \nhigher incidence of hypoglycemia and greater weight gain compared with insulin glargine.  \n \nIn the LANMET study [21], which investigated the addition of either insulin glargine or NPH \ninsulin to metformin therapy, the percentage of patients in the insulin glargine group \nexperiencing hypoglycemia were 46 and 43% during Weeks 0\u201312 and 13\u201324, respectively. \nBy comparison, a smaller proportion of patients experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia in \nour study (<19%). This may be due to the titration methods used in the two studies, insulin \ndoses reached ~60 U by Week 24 in the LANMET study, whereas in our study, the mean \n 15\ninsulin dose was <46 U for all sub-analysis groups. This balance between high insulin dose, \nchange in HbA1c and risk of hypoglycaemia is trade-off that will need to be acceptable for the \npatient. In our study, we used algorithm based on avoidance of hypoglycaemia with \nallowances for decreasing insulin dose in the event of regular hypoglycaemia, thus limiting \nthe extent to which insulin doses can be increased.  \n \nIn a study investigating continued sulfonylurea and metformin with either insulin glargine or \nrosiglitazone (patients previously treated with sulfonylurea and metformin), insulin glargine \nwas associated with significantly improved glycemic control (HbA1c and FBG) [27]. While the \nincidence of hypoglycemia was higher in the insulin glargine group, less weight gain and \nfewer adverse events occurred in the insulin glargine group. \n \nIn studies with insulin glargine [25,27,40,41], the starting dose of insulin glargine was \ntypically 10\u201320 U. By endpoint (20\u201328 weeks), the dose had increased to 25\u201340 U. In our \nstudy, patients in both treatment algorithms with >1 OAD achieved similar doses at Week \n24. However, those patients on 1 OAD achieved a greater increase in basal insulin dose \nwhen encouraged to self-titrate. \n \nEffective and efficient use of scarce healthcare resources is an important aspect of care. An \napproach which increases patient-driven management is as effective and reduces the need \nfor face to face contact with healthcare professionals is thus potentially a more effective use \nof healthcare resources. However, it has been reported that healthcare providers \nunderestimate the proportion of patients who would be willing to take part in decision-making \nabout their treatment [42].  \n \nThe approach to insulin initiation and dose titration with a single injection of insulin titrated \nagainst a fasting blood glucose level [37], as used here, is a simple and consistent \napproach, which is conducive to being taught in a group setting, and has also been shown to \n 16\nbe a more effective use of healthcare professional time. Indeed, in a study by Yki-Jarvinen et \nal, were patients were encouraged to self-adjust their insulin dose, with education delivered \neither in a group or individual setting, improvements in HbA1c were similar in both arms \n(Group: 8.8 to 6.8%; Individual: 8.7 to 6.9%). However the time spent by the healthcare \nprofessional per patient was significantly less with Group than with Individual education (2.2 \nvs 4.2 hours; p<0.001) [43].  \n \nThe findings presented here support those observed in the full cohort, that two simple, \nwidely applicable titration algorithms (either patient- or physician-driven) for the initiation of \nglargine can be implemented in clinical practice with low incidence of hypoglycemia. We also \nshow that patient-driven dose titration achieves more pronounced improvements in glycemic \ncontrol compared with physician-driven titration, and this improvement is not associated with \nan increased risk of hypoglycemic episodes. Moreover, subjects with type 2 diabetes, sub-\noptimally controlled with OADs, can safely and effectively participate in the management of \ntheir treatment if given simple information and support, with the potential to significantly \nreduce the burden of care on healthcare professionals. Further intensification of the insulin \nregimen would be expected to help more patients reach their recommended treatment \ntargets. \n 17\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis study was sponsored by sanofi-aventis.
