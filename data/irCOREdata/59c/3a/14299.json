A large proportion of this\nbody of law is descriptive and factual, but complex too; and the constraints of academic\ncurricula do not allow students to learn procedural law in the real environment of the\ncourt. As a result, even with the inclusion of case law, and with examples to contextualize\nthe procedural principles, the subject can be perceived as an exercise in knowledge\nacquisition alone (Vaughn, 1995).\nThis was the case with the Civil and Criminal Procedure module offered by the department\nof Law and Public Administration at Glasgow Caledonian University. In the original\nframework for teaching and assessment within the module, we attempted to address these\nissues in the syllabus by asking students to draft documentation from either side of the\ncourt action using precognitions (statement of the client) issued to them, and to integrate\nthis with aspects of procedure. They also produced a letter to a client dealing with a\nproblem which would require them to address procedural issues. This project was, in effect,\na limited practical application of what they were learning in their lectures and tutorials.\n87\nKaren Barton and Patricia McKellar The Virtual Court Action: procedural facilitation in law\nHowever, there were drawbacks to this approach. Interactivity was minimal, and there was\nno place in it for the role of the Sheriff Clerk (the court administrator). This absence\nchanged the process significantly, and may have confused students. In addition, students\nwere not involved in legal decision-making processes, and were working in a vacuum with\nlittle sense of the pressures of a court action and responsibilities owed to the client. The\nidea of transforming this approach to a more active-learning one - one in which students\nwould raise and defend their own hypothetical actions - was attractive, but within the\nconfines of a paper-based environment this was impractical for a number of reasons:\n1. The process of drafting becomes mechanistic with the student concentrating on format\nnot content (Kissam, 1987).\n2. The time required to complete the project would be disproportionate in relation to other\nsubjects covered in the module.\n3. There were practical difficulties in the transmission of documents between parties.\n4. The member of staff who acted in the role of Sheriff Clerk would have to be available in\nperson, during office hours, for the duration of the project. This would have been an\ninefficient use of staff time\n5. There was no opportunity for tutor involvement, and tutors could only with difficulty\nmonitor student progress.\n6. Student progression from one document to another could not be checked.\nThe Virtual Court Action was developed by the authors of this paper in late 1996 to\naddress these and other issues.\nDevelopment of the software\nFrom the start we defined a number of approaches we wished to take in the design of the\nsoftware. The Law department had identified a set of personal transferable skills (PTSs) we\nwished students to develop. A number of these, particularly group work, problem-solving\nand communication skills, were targeted in our design.1 Our department had also taken a\npolicy decision to develop computer-based learning (CBL) using constructivist principles\nwhere possible. This included the use of simulations and context-rich situated learning -\nwhat Grabinger and Dunlap (1995) have termed REALs: Rich Environments for Active\nLearning. In addition, we wanted to use CBL to promote problem-solving and higher-level\ncritical skills within the domain of legal procedure (Facione, 1986; McMillan, 1987).\nHowever, we were aware that what might be termed a radical constructivist intervention in\nthe curriculum, in which students would be plunged into problem-solving without many of\nthe usual support mechanisms, may well have had the effect of de-motivating students\n(Laurillard, 1993). We therefore decided to adopt an approach which drew upon the\nrhetorical tradition of imitatio, which was redeployed recently in the cognitive approaches\nto learning by, among others, Pirolli and Anderson (1985). They observed that examples\nplay an important role for students in the learning of concepts. This principle was taken\nfurther by Kessler and Anderson (1986), who suggested that effective learning in the field\nof computer programming is enhanced through the development of meta-skills where\nlearners learn to construct mental models of examples which can then be transferred to\n88\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nother, related tasks. In our developmental work we applied this methodology to the field of\nlegal procedure and document-drafting in order to facilitate students in the acquisition of\nthese skills. In taking this approach to task design, we were attempting to achieve a\nbalanced constructivist view of learning which would enhance critical thinking and PTSs.\nThe Virtual Court Action was constructed using HotDocs, an intelligent document\nassembly application. HotDocs interfaces with a number of standard word-processing\nprograms, in our case MS Word 6. We chose this word processor for several reasons:\n1. It enabled us to create context-rich environments because it provided us with an\nenvironment in which to design and create complex templates.\n2. Having learned to use Word in IT modules, our students would readily grasp the\nHotDocs interface.\n3. The application is widely used by legal firms in the USA, and a number of legal firms in\nthe UK were already using it.\nTo begin the process of authoring templates, we identified text variables within documents,\nand linked these variables to user prompts and help text. We then created and customized a\nuser-interface by grouping variables into dialogues, providing help text where appropriate.\nThroughout, we were concerned to strike the balances between what we regarded as pairs\nof unproductive extremes. The first pair concerned giving support in problem-recognition.\nWe needed to give students the right sort of information to make them aware that a\ndecision had to be made, without leading them overtly through the process. If they simply\nfilled in variables without understanding the procedural logic underlying their choices, they\nwould come to very little understanding of the process of legal procedure; nor would they\nbe practising any PTSs. In this, we wanted to avoid the situation described by Atkins (1993)\nwho suggested that the constructivist use of interactive technologies and simulations tend\nto rely on pre-determined decision points, and that it may be difficult 'to improve users'\ninterpersonal skills in professional contexts where the user would himself be an important\nfactor in the way the situation developed'.\nThe second of these pairs involved providing enough information to support student\nproblem-solution, and supplying too much. If too little information about the nature of the\ntask were provided, students would be unable to transfer their learning from lectures and\ntutorials. But if too much information were available, navigation through windows of text\ncould become difficult for users. In addition, there would be little in the way of problem-\nsolving for students to carry out.\nIn striking these balances, it was crucial for us as developers to see tasks from the users'\npoint of view, and to distinguish between cognitively simple and cognitively complex tasks.\nSimple tasks could be performed for the users by the software. Complex tasks were those\nnodal or crucial tasks, in the performance of which students would need to consider docu-\nment format, content, audience, procedural alternatives, timelines, or any combination of\nthese. Clearly, the cognitive complexity of any task increased as the number of the above\nfactors in it increased, and we were aware that if the software were to be successful, the\nlevel of task complexity would have to be carefully planned.\nFor this reason, we designed help text at key points in the dialogues to provide a support\n89\nKaren Barton and Patricia McKellar The Virtual Court Action: procedural facilitation in law\nscaffold for students' decisions. We hoped this scaffold would alert students to the necessity\nto make a decision, without telling them which decision it was, or the appropriate solution.\nMore particularly, the scaffold allowed us space in which to define terms, explain aspects of\nprocedure, guide students' strategic choices, and alert students as to the consequences of\nspecific decisions.\nDescription of the software use\nThe project was piloted over a four-week period in February 1997 with 70 full-time and\npart-time undergraduates. The students were assigned to groups of three, and each group\nbecame the pursuer or defender in a civil court action. The role of the Sheriff Clerk was\ntaken by the course tutor. Each side was issued with a unique case scenario which gave\nsufficient information to allow the action to be initiated or defended. The students then\nactively progressed the action by drafting the appropriate legal documentation and cor-\nresponding with each other and with the Sheriff Clerk using email. During the process,\nstudents responded to the various dialogues and prompts presented to them. These\nresponses were merged with the template to produce the final formatted document. Time\nlimits were based on those set by the court, taking account of the University semester.\nAt the conclusion of the project, the students were required to submit, inter alia,\n\u2022 a portfolio for assessment which included a printed copy of all documentation\npertaining to their case;\n\u2022 an individual report which identified and summarized the learning objectives and skills\nthat had been met as a result of participating in the project\nThe library of document templates was made available to all students. Each group then\nhad to identify the appropriate documentation for their roles as either pursuer or defender.\nNext, they needed to assemble the document electronically by answering questions\npresented in the dialogues. These dialogues supported user-needs to understand all the\nrelevant legal points arising from the document, and the communicational variables within\nthe document. Both pursuers and defenders would thus find all the supporting information\nthey needed within the dialogues and the help facility.\nA series of different dialogue types was employed in each document template in order to\nprovide a rich and appropriate learning environment. These ranged from simple selection\nfrom a list of given options to drafting sections of text incorporating legal argument. The\nresulting document was then sent to the appropriate party by email. The action continued as\nin the actual court environment with the parties corresponding with each other and the\nSheriff Clerk. A distinct advantage of the Virtual Court Action over the paper-based version\nwas access to the Sheriff Clerk, which was considerably improved through the use of email. In\naddition, where in a paper-based project the Sheriff Clerk would have assumed a passive and\nreactive role only, in the virtual version the tutor\/Sheriff Clerk was able to monitor student\nprogress and interact with students where appropriate. This interaction is important in realia\nscenaria - take, for example, Jones (1994, 182): 'Feedback [on a task] should be [. . .]\nimmediate and students should also be able to move on as and when they wish'.\nThe students received a one-hour training session prior to the commencement of the\nproject, and were provided with user-guides for the Virtual Court Action and email.\n90\nAn-] Volume 6 Number I\nStudent feedback from questionnaires showed that this was adequate preparation (85 per\ncent indicated they could use email effectively, and 90 per cent that the dialogues were\nstraightforward to complete.)\nProject evaluation methodology\nMuch of our project evaluation methodology derives from the recommendations of the\nTILT Project (Draper et al, 1995). In particular, we were aware that our evaluation,\nbecause it was integrated with real-time teaching and learning and therefore open to auto-\ncompensation and many other effects, would not be a controlled experiment but an\nevaluation of the overall teaching and learning situation. We were satisfied that as such, it\nwould be 'ecologically valid' for its purposes (Draper et al, 1995).\nThe real-time nature of our evaluation meant that direct comparison between a paper-based\nversion and a virtual version of the project within the same year group was impracticable\nfrom an administrative point of view, and might also possibly be construed by students as\ninequitable from an assessment point of view. We did, however, elicit qualitative data on the\nadvantages and disadvantages of the learning method as it existed previous to The Virtual\nCourt Action. Students were of the opinion that this method was 'a bit artificial', and could\ngive rise to confusion about roles and procedures. Neither of these criticisms was made of\nThe Virtual Court Action. Indeed, it was significant that students from the previous year\nwho took part in the video protocol indicated that the application made the creation of\ndocuments 'more straightforward' and allowed them to 'concentrate on what was in the\ndocument rather than the format of it' (evaluation action research notes).\nFormative evaluation was employed during development of the templates and user-\ninterfaces in order to determine the ease of navigation within and between templates. This\ntook the form of video talk-aloud protocols which were used with groups of students.\nAfter studying their responses and comments, a number of aspects of the user interface\nwere modified.\nIn the summative evaluation, students were asked to provide feedback in the form of a\nquestionnaire as well as in the report which was submitted for assessment. The aim of the\nquestionnaire was, firstly, to assess the success of the project in terms of student\nmotivation and perception of skills\/knowledge acquired, and secondly to provide feedback\nfor future development. Throughout the period of the project the groups were also\nobserved informally in the computer laboratories.\nDiscussion of student feedback\nOf the 70 students who took part in the project, 52 (74 per cent) completed and returned\nthe questionnaire. The following analysis of feedback has been restricted to that part of the\nquestionnaire which focuses on the students' perception of the usefulness of the project\nand the evaluation of confidence levels among the students using the software.\nFeedback from the students has been very positive. A summary of the most significant\nresults is detailed in Figure 1.\nAll of the students found the courseware useful, with 83 per cent expressing a positive\nbenefit from participating, and a significant majority (65 per cent) indicating that they\n91\nKaren Barton and Patricia McKelbr The Virtual Court Action: procedural facilitation in law\nUsefulness of Courseware\nA U K\nhelpful\n6% Hetlful\nVery \/ T 7 \\ \" *\nhelpful\n40%\nExtension of\nCourseware Use?\nDid not\n6%\nConfidence Levels - Court\nProcedure\n\" \" Nelher\nVery much Response moretess\nm o r e\n ^ * ^ confident\n10% \/ ^M\u00bb \\\nV 1 )Quto X , ! ^ \/ Lttte more\nconfidenl confident\n38% 4 S %\nFigure I: Summary of student-feedback results\nwould like to see the courseware extended within the module. An encouraging 94 per cent\nstated that their confidence level in procedure had increased. Similarly, 83 per cent\nindicated their confidence levels in document-drafting had increased. In neither case were\nstudents less confident. While confidence should not be equated with competence, it is\naxiomatic that confidence can be regarded as an indicator of how an individual expects to\nperform in a given situation.\nOne aim in developing this courseware was to shift the emphasis from traditional lectures\nand seminars in order to make more effective use of staff time. Although 39 per cent of\nstudents indicated that they would accept a reduction in the number of seminars and\nlectures, only 8 per cent were in favour of total replacement. This is possibly a reflection of\nstudents' unwillingness to relinquish the traditional forms of learning. It should be noted\nthat during the pilot project one seminar per week was dropped compared to previous\nyears, and the intention is to increase this in future.\nStudents comments contained in the questionnaires and reports were extremely positive.\nComments fell into three categories: active learning, acquisition of PTS, and vocational\nrelevance. Students liked the interactivity of the program ('[it] made us recognize the\nprocedure because we were part of it rather than being told about it during a lecture').\nAlthough the acquisition of PTSs was not formally addressed with students, it is clear from\nthe comments that students were able to identify and acquire a range of PTSs they\npractised in the project. They recognized that they were working in groups and\nindividually, meeting time limits, and enhancing their communication and learning skills.\nAs one student put it, '[it was a] worthwhile exercise, promoting a joint learning experience\nencouraging teamwork and individual participation and responsibilities'. Students found\nthe vocational relevance of the project stimulating, with comments like: 'This is more\nrelevant to what happens in the workplace when targets have to be met'. Moreover,\nstudents very strongly indicated further improvement of their general IT skills, in\nparticular the practical application of email and document assembly.\nFuture directions\nAs a result of the success of this pilot, we intend to:\n\u2022 increase software use within the area of civil procedure and other court processes\nwithin the module, and apply it to other areas of substantive law;\n92\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\n\u2022 incorporate other innovative applications of IT to provide further enhancements to the\nproject - the most significant of these is the creation of a discussion forum such as an\nAnswer Garden (Ackerman and Malone, 1990), allowing students to exchange ideas\nand participate in peer learning;\n\u2022 investigate distance-learning options and real-time conferencing applications.\nConclusions\nStudents clearly enjoyed taking part in the project. This resulted in increased motivation\nnot only to complete their tasks but also to understand civil court procedure. The real-life\nenvironment and contextualization of the subject material was a positive incentive for\nstudents, allowing them to set their own objectives and see the effect of their own actions.\nOverall, the quality of submitted work improved. In particular the summative assessment\nrevealed a higher level of understanding of the interactive nature of the court process.\nNote\n1\n The legal profession supports the view that PTSs should be embedded at undergraduate\nlevel. In a survey of solicitors discussing the content of the legal curriculum in England\nand Wales, for instance, respondents were of the opinion that Law graduates did not\npossess sufficient problem-solving or communicational skills, and that these should begin\nto be taught at the academic stage of legal education (Bright, 1991)\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Paul Maharg of the Department of Law and Public\nAdministration, Glasgow Caledonian University, for his invaluable help and encourage-\nment.\nReferences\nAckerman, M. and Malone, T.
