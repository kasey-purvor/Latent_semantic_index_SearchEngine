SSTL\u2019S HERITAGE IN EARTH OBSERVATION  \nThe first five satellites of the Disaster Monitoring \nConstellation (DMC) launched in 2002-2005 demonstrated the \nhumanitarian, political and technological value of Earth \nimaging using cost-effective small satellites. Having met the \nprimary objectives of their buyers, DMC spacecraft are \nfacilitating the delivery of commercial earth observation data \nservices. The British National Space Centre provided \u00a315M in \nfunding through the MOSAIC (MicroSatellite Applications in \nCollaboration) program from 2000 which helped develop the \nSSTL \u2018enhanced\u2019 microsatellite platform and camera used for \nthe DMC spacecraft.  \nMOSAIC has now leveraged significant export sales, \ncommencing with AlSat-1 for the Algerian Space Agency \n(CNTS). The UK government, the Nigerian Agency for Space \nResearch & Development (NASRDA), the Turkish Ministry of \nScience and Technology research institute BILTEN TUBITEK \nand the Chinese Ministry of Science & Technology have since \npurchased Disaster Monitoring Constellation spacecraft.   \nThe partners listed above formed the DMC consortium, \nagreeing to reserve 5% of system capacity for disaster \nmanagement, to operate as part of a constellation, to share data, \nand to investigate commercial exploitation of the data. In \nNovember 2005, the DMC, coordinated by SSTL\u2019s business \nunit DMC Imaging International (DMCii)  officially joined the \n\u201cInternational Charter: Space and Major Disasters\u201d, supplying \nbroad daily image coverage during disasters such as hurricane \nKatrina and the Indian Ocean Tsunami.  \nThe Beijing-1 microsatellite, built for the Beijing \nLandView Mapping Information Technology Co. (BLMIT), of \nBeijing, China, was added to the DMC constellation in October \n2005. Beijing-1 is the first DMC+4 spacecraft built by SSTL. \nDMC+4 combines the basic DMC wide area multispectral \npayload, operating at 32m Ground Sample Distance (GSD) at \nnadir and detailed in Section IV, with a 4m GSD panchromatic \ninstrument, also detailed in Section IV. This pair of instruments \nwill provide compatibility with DMC data, for example \ngenerating a cloud free map of China every 6 months, and \nenable out systematic mapping at a higher resolution in support \nof the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Beijing-1, which had a \nmass of 160kg at launch, is classified as an SSTL-150 \nspacecraft and is shown undergoing final assembly , integration \nand test in Figure 1: \n \nFigure 1.

In-orbit image from Beijing-1, Valencia, Spain at ~4m GSD \nThe following image illustrates the potential of the wide \narea multispectral imager, which can deliver images up to \n600km wide and 2000km long, limited only by the capacity of \non-board data recorders and downlink data rates. \n \nFigure 3.

COST EFFECTIVE EARTH OBSERVATION FROM SPACE \nThe key benefit of using small, cost effective spacecraft \nsuch as Bejing-1, delivered for a contract value of $18M \nincluding launch, ground station and early orbit operations is \neach small spacecraft can now offer capability that has \npreviously only been available at much higher cost and on \nlarger platforms. In constellations, i.e. when several spacecraft \noperate in collaboration, such as through flying at regularly \nspaced intervals in a single orbit plane, the price-performance \nbalance is unmatched.  \nSpecifically, constellations of small spacecraft enable high \ntemporal resolution (i.e. frequent revisits over targets of \ninterest) to be matched with high spatial resolution (GSD), for \na total mission cost well within that of a single conventional \nlarge remote sensing spacecraft. Although spacecraft cannot \napproach the best resolutions offered by aerial platforms, the \nlatest generation of high resolution commercial imaging \nspacecraft are claiming 0.5m GSD at nadir [1]. However the \nrevisit period of such spacecraft is typically 2-3 days, the best \nresolution is only gained in the image centre, and capability \nitself has cost in the order of $500M to develop (based on the \npublished US government NextView contract value). In \ncontrast, a typical small spacecraft such as NigeriaSat-2 can be \nbuilt for an order of magnitude less, will offer a GSD as good \nas 2m, and can offer daily repeat with as few as 2 spacecraft, \nboth of which can be launched using a single low cost rocket. \nFigures 4 and 5 illustrate how constellations of small, low \ncost spacecraft can offer the unique blend of resolution, \ntimeliness and utility for the maximum number of applications: \n \nFigure 4.  Comparison of revisit time v. resolution for traditional v. \ncommercial high resolution v. SSTL spacecraft \nThe price-performance balance which a constellation of \nsmall satellites offers, coupled with its tolerance to failure, \nability to be upgraded over time and low cost of entry (crucial \nto developing nations or small national programs) suggests that \nthe future of Earth observation lies this way. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Constellations such as DMC sit at the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 of \nmaximum application overlap. \nIII. HIGH PERFORMANCE  LOW COST EARTH OBSERVATION \nPLATFORM: THE SSTL-300 \nThe SSTL-300 and associated optical sensor suite has been \ndeveloped to provide customers with a capability that has \npreviously only been available at much higher cost and on \nlarger platforms. This platform offers a 7-year mission lifetime \nwith a very high operational availability. \n \nFigure 6.  NigeriaSat-2, the first SSTL-300 spacecraft \nThe first SSTL-300, Nigeriasat-2 will provide Nigeria with \nvaluable geographically referenced imaging for mapping, \nclimate change monitoring, water resources management, \nagricultural planning, population estimation, health hazard \nmonitoring and disaster mitigation and management. \nThrough Nigeriasat-2, Nigeria will continue contributing to \nthe DMC, fully controlling the satellite from NASRDA's new \nsatellite mission control centre facilities in Abuja, Nigeria. \nNigeriasat-2, weighing about 300 kilograms at launch, will \nfeature a high-capacity solid-state onboard recorder with a 16-\ngigabyte memory and a downlink capacity of up to 210 \nmegabits per second in X-band. \nNigeriasat-2 will be able to produce images with a 2.5-\nmeter ground resolution in black-and-white mode, and a 5-\nmeter resolution in multispectral mode. Designed to operate \nfrom a 700-kilometer orbit for seven years, the satellite will \nproduce up to 400 images per day. \nIV. SSTL EARTH OBSERVATION PAYLOADS \nA. Very high high resolution cameras \nThe SSTL-300\u2019s main payload is a very high-resolution \nimager (VHRI) with a panchromatic 2.5m ground sampling \ndistance (GSD) channel and four multispectral channels \noffering 5m GSD.  \n \nFigure 7.  4m GSD panchromatic and multispectral imager for Beijing-1 \n(2.5m GSD NigeriaSat-2 imager similar design) \nThe imager swath is 20km in all channels. This imager is an \nextension of the 4m GSD imager already flying on Beijing-1, \nwhich was launched in October 2005. \nB. Wide area multispectral cameras \nAdditional payloads can be accommodated such as the \nSLIM6 medium resolution multispectral imager (MRI), \noffering 22m or 32m GSD in up to four multiple spectral bands \nwith a 300km swath. Green red and near infra-red bands are \nequivalent to with LandSat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) \nbands +2, +3 and +4 respectively. The SLIM6 imager uses \ncommercial lenses, linear array CCDs and electronics: \n \nFigure 8.  32m GSD multispectral \u2018SLIM6\u2019 imager \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 05:10 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nThe 32m SLIM6 has already flown on five previous \nDisaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) Missions. The \nimproved 3-band , 22m version will fly on two SSTL missions \nin 2008, and a 4-band (inc. blue color), 32m version will fly on \nNigeriaSat-2 in 2009. \nC. Other cameras \nA five band, medium resolution medium swath imager is \nalso available, with performance lying between the VHRI and \nthe SLIM6 multispectral imager. A similar camera will fly on \nthe five RapidEye spacecraft due for launch in the second half \nof 2007. The CHRIS imager is a hyperspectral camera with \nresolution, imaged area and spectral resolution selectable \nremotely, the latter between 1.25 and 11nm. A CHRIS has \nbeen in operation on the PROBA spacecraft since 2001.

SSTL SPACECRAFT PAYLOAD  PERFORMANCE COMPARISON  \nD. Supporting subsystems \nSSTL-300 image data is compressed on-board using \nlossless data compression, for store-and-forward operations. \nFurthermore, switchable data encryption standard is available \non the telemetry \/ telecommand, and switchable scrambling on \npayload data. Near real-time imaging & down-linking is \npossible for a range of targets close to the ground station. \n \nFigure 9.  Beijing-1 digital signal processor (image compressor). Size is ~160 \n\u00d7 115mm, depth 30mm.  \nHigh performance geo-location (with and without use of \nground control points) is provided, the fidelity exceeding \n100m, dependent on the chosen subsystem options. On-board \npropulsion, not usually a feature of low cost microsatellites, is \nincluded for orbit maintenance, launcher injection correction, \nand (optionally) initial formation of a constellation. \nV. APPLICABLE IMAGING MODES \nThe SSTL-300 is capable of simultaneous imaging using \nthe VHRI and the MRI, and scenes can be as long as 2000km, \nas shown in Figure 10. A range of other imaging modes are \navailable including: strip mapping, fast response scene capture, \nand stereo imaging to provide digital elevation models. A \nfurther high resolution area mode imaging mode stitches \nindividual panchromatic or multispectral images together \nonboard the spacecraft to provide a tiled set of wide-swath and \nhigh-resolution imagery up to 60km on a side.  \n \nFigure 10.  Combined wide swath and high resolution imaging modes \nVI. MISSION PARAMETERS \nThe nominal orbit for the SSTL-300 will be sun-\nsynchronous, with a 10.30am node (time of equator crossing) \nto provide repeatable global coverage and good lighting \nconditions. The platform will orbit at approximately 700km, \nwhich provides good optimization for single satellite and \nconstellation revisits, and allows compatibility of image data \nwith the previous DMC spacecraft which orbit at an altitude of \n686km.  \nSSTL through its low cost Earth observation platforms and \nconstellations, pioneered by the DMC and continued with the \nNigeriaSat-2 SSTL-300 have introduced a new standard for \ngenerating cost effective Earth imagery from space. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nSSTL would like to thank the National Space Research & \nDevelopment Agency (NASRDA) of Nigeria for funding the \nfirst flight of the SSTL-300, NigeriaSat-2, scheduled for 2009. \nREFERENCES \n[1] DigitalGlobe Constellation; Marketing brochure (Worldview 1). \nDigitalGlobe, Longmont CO, USA, April 2007.  \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
