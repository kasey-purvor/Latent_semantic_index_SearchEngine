Kearnes \nDepartment of Geography \nThe Open University \n \nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a King of infinite \nspace. Hamlet, II:2 \n \nIntroduction \nThe theme of this special edition of Social and Cultural Geography \u2013 \u2018Culture Matters\u2019 \u2013\nresonates with a number of themes current within geographical thought. The double \nmeaning of \u2018matter\u2019 \u2013 simultaneously designating a concept of worth (the verb \u2018to \nmatter\u2019) and a physical \u2018materiality\u2019 (the noun \u2018matter\u2019) \u2013 is symbolic of the broad scope \nof its terms. In the first instance matter is used in asserting the significance of certain \nacademic accounts. For a particular account to be significant \u2013 to be of strategic, political \nor professional importance \u2013 it must \u2018matter\u2019. Put in this way the rhetorical force of \nmatter is clear. Imbued with notions of the undiluted physicality of \u2018the real\u2019, for a \nrepresentation \u2018to matter\u2019 it must be mimetically linked with an external materiality \u2013 the \nreal world. \u2018To matter\u2019 is thus simultaneously to designate the importance of a particular \nrepresentation and to engage in the active creation of a mimetic materiality. \u2018To matter\u2019 is \ntherefor also \u2018to do matter\u2019, to produce certain forms of physicality deemed discursively \nsignificant. In this way matter occupies a rhetorical position within contemporary \ngeographical criticism. The material connotations of matter \u2013 its sensuous proximity to \nthe real \u2013 are used to signify the veracity or significance of certain representations. The \ntheme \u2018Culture Matters\u2019 echoes this rhetoric by provocatively recalling the early criticisms \nof cultural geography as lacking material bases and therefor interpretative significance \n(Badcock, 1996; Mitchell, 1995; 1996)1.  These criticisms suggested that cultural analyses \nlack grounding in material reality (a limited characterisation at best) and therefor they also \nlack significance. The effect of these criticisms is to suggest that cultural geography does \nnot produce an appropriately mimetic materiality \u2013 that it is abstract or novel \u2013 and thus \nthat it \u2018does not matter\u2019. For example Mitchell (1995) directly contrasts the analysis of \ncultural against matter \u2013 as an analysis of ephemerality. He states that: \n \n[F]or all the important theoretical and empirical advances this reconceptualization \n(of culture) has induced, cultural geography still reifies \u2018culture\u2019 and assigns it an \n 2\n ontological and explanatory status. \u2026 I argue instead for a focus on the material \ndevelopment of the idea (or ideology) of culture. (p. 102, emphasis added) \n \nFor Mitchell (1995) culture cannot be reified as an explanatory device simply because it \nhas no material physicality. Culture, for Mitchell, does not matter. It is the possibility of \nanalysis unconnected \u2013 and seemingly unconcerned \u2013 with material and empirical reality \nthat troubles both Mitchell and Badcock. The terminology of matter \u2013 of the potent \nsignificance of the material \u2013 is deployed symbolically against this very possibility. Culture \nis denied any ontological basis outside its physical materialisation. Heroically returning \nanalysis to the mimetic safety of matter the significance of geographical scholarship is \npresented as proportional to its connection with empirical and material reality. The \nrhetorical articulation of \u2018geographies that matter\u2019 has involved an articulation of the \nphysicality of its field of enquiry. For example there have been a number of calls for a \ngeographical return to a grounding in physical materiality. Jackson (2000) proposes a \u2018re-\nmaterialisation\u2019 of social and cultural geography \u2013 a return to more traditional \ngeographical concerns based in the \u2018actual\u2019 life-world of people. Similarly Philo (2000) \nproposes a \u2018re-introduction of the material in human geography\u2019. There is a distinction \nhere in the precise connotations of both Jackson\u2019s and Philo\u2019s (re)invocation of matter in \nhuman geography. For Jackson to re-introduce a kind of materialist analysis is to refocus \nattention on the relationship between people and things (Lees, 2002). Whereas Philo is \ndriven by a Latourian desire to expressly re-valorise the irreducible materiality of the \nobjects of geographic research. Indeed Philo (2000) makes this claim by suggesting that \nmatter is somehow lost within contemporary social and cultural geography. He states: \n \nYet , what I wish to signpost now are some concerns that I (and others) have \nabout this dematerializing of human geography: the preoccupation with immaterial \ncultural processes, with the constitution of intersubjective meaning systems, with \nthe play of identity politics through the less-than-tangible, often-fleeting spaces of \ntexts, signs, symbols, psyches, desires, fears and imaginings. I am concerned that, \nin the rush to elevate such spaces in our geographical studies, we have ended up \nbeing less attentive to the more \u2018thingy\u2019, bump-into-able, stubbornly there-in-the-\nworld kinds of \u2018matter\u2019 (the material) with which earlier geographers tended to be \nmore familiar. (p. 33) \n \nIt is suggested that the analysis of culture \u2013 which has hitherto been confined to an \nhermeneutic consideration of cultural, textual, and discursive meaning \u2013 needs to be firmly \ngrounded in the analysis of the physical manifestation of culture (Gregson, 1995; Miller, \n1987; 1998). Thus, for example, it is suggested that contemporary studies of cultural \n 3\n consumption must consider the materiality of consumed objects rather than rely solely \nupon abstract semiotic or textual methodologies. In this way the double meaning of \nmatter is simultaneously deployed \u2013 that for geographies to \u2018matter\u2019 they must return to \n\u2018the material\u2019. In this way this paper analyses the double meaning of this return to matter \n\u2013 the proposition that representative significance is necessarily tied to material physicality. \nIndeed the subject of this discussion is not only this articulation of a kind of physicalist \nanalysis into geography but also the way in which it is expressly constructed as a return to \na more basic form of analysis.  \n \n\u2018The physical\u2019 connotes a diverse range of contemporary thought. Feminist scholars have \ncalled for an analysis of the ways in which subjectivity and cognition are formed through \na bodily inhabitation of the physical world (Grosz, 1994; Gatens, 1996; Kirby, 1997; \nLonghurst, 1997). Indeed, Butler (1993; 1994; 1997) initiated the use of term \n\u2018materialisation\u2019 to express the ways in which the corporeal subject is materialised \nthrough regimes of power and discourse. The notion of a corporeal inhabitation of the \nphysical world \u2013 or \u2018dwelling\u2019 \u2013 the inter-subjective experience of the material world has \nalso been explored by authors challenging the inherent anthropocentrism of \u2018human\u2019 \ngeography. In exploring the ways in which human dwelling(s) of and in the material \nworld are necessarily co-dependent upon non-human actors (Ingold, 1995) notions of \nthe non-human and material subjectivity, sociality and relationality have been explored \n(Murdoch, 1997; Whatmore, 1997; 2000). Also drawing upon the work of Latour\u2019s (1993) \nnotion of a \u2018parliament of things\u2019, Law\u2019s (1994; see also Law and Mol [1995]) conception \nof a \u2018relational materialism\u2019 and Serres\u2019 (1995) quizzical \u2018quasi-object\u2019, contemporary \nauthors in geography have sought to re-read the traditional philosophical subject-object \nrelation precisely as a relational intersubjectivity (Bingham, 1996; Hinchliffe, 1996). Indeed, \nthe focus upon the various ways in which human subjectivity is constituted in and \nthrough a relational embodiment of the material, natural and inter-subjective world \nnecessitates a valorisation of the physical.  \n \nIn these ways both the material and the physical are invoked tangentially. That is matter \nis implicated in an analysis of the embodiment of the subject in a physical body, in a \nnotion of discursive materialisation and in the re-thinking of the subject-object relation as \na complex network. This paper does not attempt to deal with the breadth of this field. \nRather it is the deployment of the notion of physicality \u2013 the \u2018thingness\u2019 of things, the \n 4\n tactility of matter \u2013 that this paper explicitly explores. In fact the notion of physicality \u2013 \nthe valorisation of the cultural \u2018object\u2019 over meaning, discourse and language \u2013 advanced \nin the work of Miller (1987; 1998), Jackson (2000), Philo (2000) and Lees (2002) is \nspecifically addressed in this discussion2. Whereas other movements insinuate a notion of \n\u2018the physical\u2019 or \u2018the (materially) relational\u2019 these authors extend their analytical scope to \nmatter itself. The significance of this fact is that by constructing a rematerialisation these \nauthors awaken a metaphysical Pandora\u2019s box. To discuss matter is to discuss one of the \nmost philosophically enduring concepts in Western metaphysics. The idea that social and \ncultural geography may simply \u2018return\u2019 to a lost materialism must be enlivened with a \nthorough consideration of which (or perhaps whose) matter we are returning to3.   \n \nThe aim here is to complicate notions of physicality by suggesting that contemporary calls \nfor a return to the material problematically adopt a universal metaphysics of matter. \nWestern philosophical history is dominated by a conception of a universal, Aristotelian \nmetaphysics of matter \u2013 that matter is a universal attribute of all things that exist \nphysically. Matter is that which forms the universal ontological basis of all existing things. \nSuch universalist tendencies in the wider philosophical consideration of matter present \nmany dilemmas for a geographical project that aims to be theoretically non-essentialist \n(through the critique of hegemonic dualisms) and methodologically particularist (through \nethnographic analyses of specific materialities). As such this paper suggests that calls for a \n\u2018return to the material\u2019 in social and cultural geography must be more philosophically \nexplicit. Without candid consideration of the metaphysical connotations of a \u2018return to \nthe material\u2019 such a project remains ill conceived and self-contradictory. By considering \nthe metaphysical implications of these moves I will conclude by suggesting a notion of \nthe \u2018expressive physicality of matter\u2019 \u2013 that matter is not simply a base to which \ngeographical analysis may return. Rather to construct a material analysis is to \u2018collaborate\u2019 \nwith the physical, to enliven its own capacities and variances.  \n \nA \u2018return to the material\u2019 \nJackson (2000) paraphrasing Gregson (1995) calls for a renewed grounding of social and \ncultural geography in the materiality of culture.  \n\u2026 Nicky Gregson warned that social geography\u2019s recent obsession with meaning, \nidentity, representation and ideology was in danger of replacing studies that were \nmore firmly grounded in material culture or concerned with socially significant \ndifferences of gender, class, race, sexuality or (dis)ability. While the potential \nevacuation of \u2018the social\u2019 in social and cultural geography remains a serious \n 5\n concern, it is the other less remarked part of Gregson\u2019s commentary that most \nconcerns me here, heralding the revival of a material culture perspective in social and \ncultural geography. (p. 9, emphasis added) \n \nHe suggests that contemporary geographical research practices have largely ignored the \nphysical manifestations of the objects of their analysis. Jackson, in concert with Gregson, \nsuggests that cultural geography\u2019s utilisation of contemporary theories of representation \nhas served to obscure the material manifestation of culture. There is a concern that the \ncurrent integration of post-structuralist and post-modernist theories into mainstream \ngeographical practice has resulted in a limiting textual bias. It is suggested that \ncontemporary theories of discourse have negated the need for a consideration of the \nmaterial altogether \u2013 that the analysis of culture through linguistic and semiotic strategies \nhas largely resulted in the disappearance of the \u2018real\u2019 object from contemporary analysis \n(Vattimo, 1988; Kirby, 1999). For example: \nAnd yet, although the difference between words and experience is a difference \nthat seems to require no special justification in everyday life, this simple wisdom \nundergoes a significant make-over when it enters the academy. Postmodern meta-\ncritique for example, informs us that language is the irreducible object of all \nanalysis. Language determines the particular purchase and shape of different \ndisciplinary formations; it illuminates the psychological architecture of the \ninterpreting subject; and its internal structuration explains the inevitable \ncontamination between subject and object. Language becomes a mode of \nproduction whose effects are so pervasive and persuasive that even materiality \nevaporates into an id\u00e9e fixe. (Kirby, 1999, 19) \n \nKirby\u2019s acerbic critique of current scholarship suggests that an unhealthy fixation upon \nlanguage has resulted in the destruction of the most basic, everyday distinction between \nwords and experience. The denigration of this distinction, by epistemological strategies \nthat posit language as a totalising system of signification, has meant that even matter \u2013 the \nmost fundamental basis of \u2018real\u2019 experience \u2013 has disappeared from current thought. For \nJackson (2000), Philo (2000) and Lees (2002) the dominance of textual methodologies \nhave obscured fuller analysis of the materiality of contemporary culture. Both Jackson \n(2000) and Philo (2000) evoke the physicality of cultural forms and artifacts as an \nalternative analyical grounding. Jackson\u2019s call for a re-materialisation of social and cultural \ngeography and Philo\u2019s appeal for a re-introduction of the material is an attempt to \nconstruct an analysis of culture that takes this physicality seriously \u2013 to re-direct \ngeographical analysis away from textual, semiotic and discursive methodologies towards \nthe material manifestations of culture in the actual object. Both assert that there is a need to \nreturn to ways in which culture is manifested materially. Both suggest that the analysis of \n 6\n practices of consumption, for example, should no longer be confined to semiotic or de-\nconstructive reading of consumptive imagery and texts. Rather the analysis of \nconsumption should, it is suggested, include a thorough ethnographic consideration of \nthe physical objects consumed, and the ways they are materially incorporated into the \nembodied life-world of the consumer. This methodology is propelled by a broader desire \nto understand what people actually do when they consume.  \n \nThe language of \u2018a return to matter\u2019 \u2013 of re-materialisation \u2013 suggests that matter occupies \na pre-existent and a priori position with respect to language and text. The methodological \ndistinction made by Jackson (2000) and Philo (2000) between text and matter subtly \npoints to the metaphysical effect of Jackson\u2019s and Philo\u2019s return to the material. Textual, \nsemiotic and discursive strategies are cast solely as renderings of the object \u2013 \nteleologically secondary and categorically distinct from the object of representation. This \nconceptualisation represents the material, the natural and the bodily as in some way a \npriori to forms of language and representation. The material forms a pre-existing, and \nabsolute conditionality upon the construction of knowledge through language. The \nrepresentation of matter as a form of \u2018original state\u2019 \u2013 as the pure thing outside the \noperation of discourse and independent (in the Kantian sense) from the subjective action \n\u2013 is indicative of the proximity of these calls to an essentialist metaphysics.  \n \nThe enterprise of returning \u2018strategically\u2019, ideally, to an origin or to a \u2018priority\u2019 \nheld to be simple, intact, normal, pure, standard, self-identical, in order then to \nthink in terms of derivation, complication, deterioration, accident etc. all \nmetaphysicians, from Plato to Rousseau, Descartes to Husserl, have proceeded in \nthis way, conceiving good before evil, the positive before the negative, the pure \nbefore the impure, the simple before the complex, the essential before the \naccidental, the imitated before the imitation, etc. And this is not just one \nmetaphysical gesture among others, it is the metaphysical exigency, that which has \nbeen the most constant, most profound. (Derrida, 1988, quoted in Kirby, 1999). \n \n \nDerrida suggests that the strategic return to forms of material originality \u2013 the \u2018real\u2019 \nobject of analysis \u2013 constitutes a metaphysical move par excellence. The crucial term in \nDerrida\u2019s designation is the term before, indicating the teleologic quality of the calls for a \nreturn to forms of pure originality. Similarly, calls for a re-materialisation of social and \ncultural geography represent matter as an analytical ground by virtue of its pre-existing \nphysicality. Although Jackson (2000) states that: \u2018[O]ur emphasis should be on when and \nwhere the materiality of material culture makes a difference rather than assuming its \n 7\n importance in an a priori manner\u2019 (p. 13), matter is articulated in both a priori and Kantian \nterms as both absolutely physical and fundamentally pure. Similarly in constructing his \nmaterial re-introduction Philo (2000) discusses the work of Lees and operationises a \nnotion of matter as both basic and universal: \u2018Lees ranges fully across a host of different \nmaterial and immaterial realms. The brute there-ness of the buildings and its contents is \ndescribed \u2026\u2019 (p. 35, emphasis added). It is only by the unquestioned assumption of a \nKantian notion of matter\u2019s metaphysical priority that Philo is able to insinuate the \nmeaning of matter is a brutal there-ness. There is nothing inherent to matter that ensures \neither its brutality or its physical stability. Rather these notions are simple meanings that \nmatter assumes under the influence of a universalist metaphysics. \n \nEssence and image \nThis notion of re-materialisation, advocated by Jackson (2000), Philo (2000) and Lees \n(2002) establishes a dichotomy between words and experience \u2013 or between the real \nworld of matter and the abstract realm of discourse. As stated above it is suggested that \ncontemporary theoretical strategies have \u2013 for the sake of intellectual fashion \u2013 largely \nignored the \u2018real\u2019 world in all its physical messiness and uncertainty. It is suggested that \nthe sheer immensity of the material world has proved too difficult to intellectual \nscholarship, which has by-and-large retreated towards the more manageable and stable \ngrounds of language. It is the distinction between the material and the linguistic that is \nheld to be paramount. For example: \nMaterial culture differs from, for example, linguistics partly in the sheer diversity \nof its subject matter. In the case of language many of the most interesting things \nthat an academic can address relate to the generality of linguistic phenomena. In \nmaterial culture, by contrast, although this is also a possible strategy there is a \ngreat deal more potential in looking at the diversity of material form than would \nbe the case with linguistics. (Miller, 1998, 6) \n \nIn this way language and matter are presented as opposing realms, matter as defiantly \ndiverse and multiple and language as limited, confined and as knowable4. Indeed, the \nmaterial operates as a sign for the natural, the pre-discursive or the a priori. In this account \nmatter stands for that which is prior to \u2013 and forms a basis for \u2013 human experience, \nperception and knowledge. The radical diversity of matter \u2013 the seeming omnipresence \nof matter \u2013 signifies the impossibility of confining the material realm within knowable \nboundaries. In this way the works of language are cast as perpetually secondary to the \npre-eminent materiality and pre-discursivity of the \u2018real\u2019 world. In comparison to the \ninfinite multiplicity of matter language is presented as simply a product of human \n 8\n experience, as a posteriori, and therefor as a finite image of the external world. Miller\u2019s \n(1987; 1998) re-articulation of the significance of the material within cultural studies \nrepresents an attempt to heroically \u2018get back to basics\u2019 \u2013 to refuse the valorisation of \nmediated (ie linguistic) knowledge over ethnographic, experiential and material \nknowledge. \n \nThe methodological distinction established between subjective textuality and objective \nphysicality is informed by a palpable distrust of contemporary semiotic, textual and de-\nconstructive methodologies. These methodologies represent the possibility of \nrepresentative analysis disconnected from the referent. This distrust of textual and \ndiscursive strategies \u2013 a fear of the power of the image (Jay, 1993) \u2013 mirrors both the \nPlatonic distrust of the image and notions of religious idolatry. Plato (383 BC [1955]) \nconstructs a dualism between the object and its appearance. The reality of the object is, \nfor Plato, defined by the essence of the object, a fundamental and irreducible attribute of \nevery physical object. In comparison the image of an object is divorced from the essence \nof the object. The object is defined objectively by its essence, whilst the image is simply a \nsecondary resemblance of the object. An object has an essence or reality in and of itself, by \nvirtue of the fact that it IS. The essence of the object is not the physical tactility of the \nobject\u2019s contours, which are based in appearance and sensation, but is the IDEA of the \nobject. The essence is the irreducible reality that is endowed in the object, by which it is \npossible to claim that it exists independently of other objects. Alternatively an object\u2019s \nphysical appearance, or its representation in other medium (for example a work of art), \nhas no essence it and of itself. The representation of the object does not exist \nindependently but is rather a copy or imitation of the object\u2019s essence. The \nrepresentation is tied mimetically to, and is therefor dependent upon, the object\u2019s \nessence. The object is thus the model and its appearance is the copy (Plato, 383 BC \n[1955]). \n \nPlato constructs a range of dualisms, around the central essence\/appearance dichotomy, \nsuch as substance\/form, model\/copy and philosophy\/poetry. Always valorising the first \nterm in each dichotomy Plato constructs an ontological critique of the arts as solely \nimitative, divorced from the originality of philosophy (Plato, 383 BC [1955]; Deleuze, \n1967). For example he discusses the relationship of the painting with the original \ndepicted object: \n 9\n  \n\u201cYou may perhaps object that the things he (the craftsman or painter) creates are \nnot real; and yet there is a sense in which the painter creates a bed, isn\u2019t there?\u201d \n\u201cYes\u201d, he agreed, \u201cHe produces and appearance of one.\u201d \n\u2026 \n\u201cIf then, what he makes is not \u2018what a bed really is\u2019 his product is not \u2018what is\u2019 \nbut something that resembles \u2018what is\u2019 without being it.\u201d (Plato, 383 BC [1955], 424) \n \nPlato\u2019s aim is to establish a universal image-free metaphysics. He is wary of the image and \nits capacity to produce resemblances divorced from the essence of the object. The danger \nposed by the image is the danger of idolatry \u2013 that as secondary and lesser to the object it \nhas the power to replace the object with the mere play of resemblances. In this way the \npossibilities for the reproduction of images with no reference to the original object is \nmost concerning. It is the potential proliferation of copies without referent, the order of \nsimulacra, that Plato designates as most deleterious to the ideal society.  \n \nIndeed, it is this anxiety regarding the possibility of representation not bound to an \nessential, or fundamentally pre-discursive reality that is at the heart of calls to ground \nresearch in the materiality of cultural objects. For example Gregson (1995), Miller (1987, \n1998) and Jackson (2000) react against the very possibility of representative simulacra \u2013 \nthe proliferation of novel representations that bear no relation to an external material \nreality of the both the object or the subject\u2019s embodied interaction with it. The call for a \nre-materialisation of social and cultural geography constitutes a Platonic drive to re-\nestablish and re-enforce the link between academic representation and essentially real \nobjects. The fact that representation, discourse and language are cast as secondary to the \nmaterial \u2013 only ever imitations of the object, the a posteriori action of (finite) human \nreason upon the (infinite) metaphysics of the material \u2013 necessitates a return toward this \nmore fundamental basis.  \n \nGiven the political and theoretical aims of the contemporary re-articulations of the \nmaterial in geography the suggestion that they parallel Plato\u2019s essence-image dichotomy is \ncontentious. The aims of this current move toward an articulation of the material, the \nnatural and the bodily (Grosz, 1994; Kirby, 1997; Whatmore 1997; Wolch & Emel 1995, \n1998) are toward a non-essentialist and non-dualistic geographical practice \u2013 through a \nconsidered critique of the existing dualisms of body-mind, matter-language and nature-\nculture. The suggestion that this re-valorisation of the \u2018real\u2019 over the \u2018mediated\u2019 mirrors \n 10\n Plato\u2019s most basic essentialism \u2013 the separation between essence and image \u2013 points to \nthe vulnerability of this current of thought to a mindless essentialism of the natural. \nAuthors such as Grosz (1999) and Whatmore (1997) have highlighted the potential for \ncalls for the \u2018return\u2019 to the material, the bodily or the natural are fraught with the \npotential of a resurgence of the essentialism of \u2018the real\u2019. Indeed, when it is suggested \nthat the material, the bodily or the natural constitute a fundamental ground upon which \nto base geographical inquiry there is a danger that this basis is posited simply as an \nundifferentiated externality. As such there is a slippage between the re-valorisation of the \nmaterial and an articulation of a universal metaphysics of the material, the natural or the \nbodily (Kirby, 1999). \n \nThere are two implications of the parallel between Plato\u2019s division between image and \nessence and the contemporary re-materialisation of social and cultural geography. As \nstated above it suggests the possibility of a re-emergence of an essentialism of the real. \nThis possibility points to the potential for contemporary articulations of matter, the body \nand the natural to unquestionably reify notions of a natural, bodily or material origin. \nSecondly the distinction constructed between language and experience institutes a \nmethodological division. The appearance of the thing is cast as both teleologically \nsecondary and inferior metaphysically. The methodologies of sight, painting, writing and \npoetry are all considered secondary to the pure realm of the thing and the idea (ie \nphilosophy). In a similar fashion calls for a \u2018return to the material\u2019 suggest that the \ncurrent academic employment of theories of representation, discourse and imagery \nactually serve to obscure the \u2018real\u2019 object of analysis.  \n \nIn this way methodologies of language and discourse are cast Platonically as endowed \nonly with a limited (and often only academically fashionable) resemblance to the object. \nTake for example Gregson\u2019s (1995) conception of the need for a \u2018material culture \nperspective\u2019 in the analysis of practices of consumption. \n \nThe geographical literature on consumption highlight clearly the ascendance of \nthe cultural, as opposed to social, theory in social geography (and in human \ngeography more generally), and cultural theory in the tradition of Gramsci, \nWilliams, Hall, and Said. At times inspirational, these writings manifestly have \nmuch to commend them. However, they bring with them a particular \ninterpretation of consumption grounded in meaning, identity, representation and \nideology. Personally, although I find these arguments attractive, I feel they require \n 11\n a firmer grounding in structural social inequalities (the significant differences of \ngender, class, race, sexuality, (dis)ability, etc.) and in material culture. (p. 139) \n \nIn this way Gregson constructs a framework whereby the interpretation of textual, \ndiscursive and representative meaning is considered epistemologically distinct from the \n\u2018real\u2019 world of both matter and structural inequalities. Gregson mirror\u2019s Plato\u2019s dualism \nby suggesting that these textual methodologies require a firmer grounding, thereby \ndivorcing language, text and imagery from the fundamental essence of the \u2018real\u2019 world. \nIndeed, it is the suggestion that \u2018material culture\u2019 may provide this firmer ground \u2013 as if \n\u2018the material\u2019 is somehow more solid, more natural and more real \u2013 that points to the \npresence of a universal metaphysics of the material in Gregson\u2019s account.  \n \nMatter as origin \nIn positing a universal metaphysics of matter \u2013 a notion of materiality as a pure origin or \nradical outside \u2013 matter is divorced from any expressive physicality. In fact a conception \nof matter as origin institutes a deductive teleology whereby matter is governed by a linear \npassage from its origin as pure material form to its destination as a social and cultural \nproduct. Take for example Miller\u2019s (1987) conception of the process of consumption: \n \n[C]onsumption as work may be defined as that which translates the object from \nan alienable to an inalienable condition; that is from a symbol of estrangement \nand price value to an artifact invested with particular inseparable connotations. \u2026 \nWork in this sense does not necessarily mean physical labour transforming the \nobject; it may signify the time of possession, a material context of presentation as \nritual gift or memorabilia, or the incorporation of the single object into a stylistic \narray which is used to express the creator\u2019s place in relation to peers engaged in \nsimilar activities. The object is transformed by its intimate association with a \nparticular individual or social group, or with the relationship between these. \n(p.191) \n \nMiller (1987) presents a dialectical notion of the material \u2013 whereby matter is subject to a \nteleological process of \u2018externalisation\u2019 and \u2018sublation\u2019. Miller\u2019s model of the production \nof matter speaks in terms of a relation of distances. The object \u2013 the pure material form \n\u2013 is initially distanced from the subject as a radical outside, a \u2018symbol of estrangement\u2019. It \nis only subsequent to this pure original state \u2013 whereby the object undergoes the social \nand cultural work of consumption that it is transformed into a consumed object. \n \nAgain Miller states that:  \n \n 12\n \u2018\u2026 the modern process of consumption is a much neglected part of the great \nprocess of sublation by which society attempts to create itself through negation\u2019 \n(p. 191) \n \nWhat is interesting here is not Miller\u2019s conception of the process of consumption but \nrather his conception of the malleability of the object\u2019s materiality. The fact that he \nconstructs the subject-object relation with reference to Hegel\u2019s dialectic between \nalienation and sublation means that the production of the product is cast simply as the \nincorporation of a universal (and universally malleable) by socio-cultural systems. The \nfact that consumption is a process whereby society attempts to create itself positions \nmatter as devoid of any creative power or defiance. In fact the methodological distinction \nbetween the material and the culture (essence and image) contributes to a notion of \nobjection as a teleological process of externalisation followed by sublation leaving matter \ninert and ineffective. \n \n \nThe effect of this teleological process of externalisation and sublation is to posit matter \nas a priori. The notion of \u2018externalisation\u2019 is the equivalent of Derrida\u2019s notion of purity \nquoted above, that material objects originate in a pure physical form upon which the \nlatter action of the consumer is enacted. The notion of distance inherent in a conception \nof externalisation re-articulates matter as a priori precisely because it specifically instigates \na notion of the object as absolutely (in the Kantian sense) external to subjective action. In \nthis way the material, whilst representing a state of absolute and infinite externality, \nalways has an origin. The material is cast as resolutely prior to and disconnected from \nsubjective action. In fact it is only the physical contours of the object (as distinct from \nthe essential object in Platonic terms) that forms a dialectical conduit between the subject \nand the object. Rather than a constant interplay between the subject and the object, this \nrelationship is governed by the dialectics of sublation. In this way the materiality of the \nobject becomes simply a synthetic point between the subject and the essential object \u2013 \nbetween an a priori object and an a posteriori subject. The articulation of the material in this \nway forms a critical stage in the re-articulation of a universal and essentialist metaphysics \nof the material.  \n \nThe stages of Miller\u2019s teleological process of externalisation and sublation attempt to map \nthe materialisation of the object, from its origin at the point of institutional or mechanical \nformation to its final societal and cultural incorporation. Not only does the implicit \n 13\n periodisation and linearity of this scheme assume matter as a fundamental a priori but \nmatter remains inert and inexpressive throughout its formation. Matter simply exists as \nan undifferentiated yet dumb externality before its mechanical and institutional formation. \nThe subsequent process of sublation simply points to the societal incorporation of the \nphysical thing without necessarily challenging its mute materiality. In this way Miller\u2019s \nschema replicates the form-content dichotomy that matter\u2019s materialisation as an object \nis not due to any independent action of matter, but rather the determinative power of the \nobject\u2019s essential form (the idea). \n \nSimilarly Lees (2002) in discussing the contribution of urban geography to a re-\nmaterialised social and cultural geography positions matter in terms of its starkness: \n \nUnlike in, say, social and cultural geography, the turn to \u2018representation\u2019 in urban \ngeography has centred on (the material) urban form. This focus on urban \nspatiality is not surprising given the city\u2019s stark physicality and obvious layering of \neconomic, cultural, political and social relations. (p.107, emphasis added) \n \nSimilarly Philo\u2019s  (2000) notion of the re-introduction of the material into contemporary \ngeography is imbued with this conception of the metaphysical externality, base-ness and \nstability of matter as he equates matter with concrete, stating: \u2018More concretely (or even \nmore materially)\u2019 (p. 37). Both Lees and Philo, together with Miller, position matter as \nsome how both obvious \u2013 as simply there \u2013 and as radically external \u2013 as in a concrete \nbasis upon which all other activity is placed. In this way a reductive logic of causality \nhaunts current calls for a \u2018material culture\u2019 approach or a rematerialisation of \ncontemporary social and cultural geography. An external materiality is acted upon by \nsocio-cultural consumption and thus becomes an object. In this way the object is only \ngranted objectivity insofar as it is culturally coded. Miller\u2019s reliance on Hegel\u2019s dialectical \nphenomenology confirms this logic of causality. Although Hegel\u2019s phenomenology \npurports to investigate the a priori conditions of knowledge \u2013 such as an absolute \nmateriality \u2013 the central figure of Hegel\u2019s dialectic is the subject (Lawlor, 1998). In this \nway absolute spatial and material infinitude is centralised upon the subject because it is \nonly through the subject (externalisation-sublation) that the object is produced. While a \nphenomenological approach appears to allow an account of matter outside its socio-\ncultural codification, the dialectic established between subject and object counters this \naim. Indeed, although Miller, Philo and Jackson purport to construct an analysis that \ndwells in the physical tactility of the object it becomes clear that the materiality of the \n 14\n object only matters inasmuch as it becomes symbolic of the process of subjective \nconsumption. For example Jackson (2000): \n \nFrom such a perspective, the meaning of material objects is embedded in specific \ncultural contexts as people use things (from \u2018traditional\u2019 pottery to \u2018modern\u2019 \nshopping centres) to objectify social relationships, providing a commentary on \ntheir social experience. (p. 10) \n \nThe physicality of the object is reduced to a sign of the relationship between the subject \nand the object, the material object is positioned simply as a \u2018commentary\u2019 upon \nsubjective experience. Indeed, the materiality of the object \u2013 held to be paramount by \nJackson \u2013 is finally divorced from the full materialisation of its physical manifestation. \nMatter only matters insofar as it objectifies \u2018social relationships\u2019. As such Jackson\u2019s return \nto matter becomes simply a sign, a rhetorical strategy in the suggestion of a more \u2018back-\nto-basics\u2019 ethnographic methodology. The fact that the phenomenological notion of the \nmatter operationalises a Kantian notion of matter as a priori disables a consideration of \nthe materiality of matter. In fact the incorporation of matter as a priori signifies the \nsubjugation of the material to a deductive teleology whereby matter only matters when \nconnected to the subject. In this way the materiality of the object matters only inasmuch \nas it \u2018objectifies social relationships\u2019 rather than as fundamentally independent and active.  \n \nConclusion \u2013 Toward an expressive physicality \nAn unasked question that haunts contemporary notions of the re-materialisation of social \nand cultural geography is; \u2018what matters about matter?\u2019. Why is there a rhetorical link \nestablished between material physicality and academic significance? The current re-\narticulations of matter, as expressed by Gregson (1995), Miller (1998), Jackson (2000), \nPhilo (2000) and Lees (2002), posit a \u2018simple there-ness\u2019 of matter \u2013 matter as the pre-\ndiscursive form of the object. Indeed these current notions of matter subjugate the \nmaterial to the Platonic dualism between essence and image and also to the reductionism \nof a linear teleology of materiality. In this way matter only matters when it is centralised \nupon the subject \u2013 symbolic of the objectification of social relationships. The expressive \nwaywardness of matter \u2013 the possibility of active forms of materiality outside the \ndialectics of the subject-object is expressly forbidden through this reductionism (Latour, \n1993, Deleuze & Guattari, 1994, Law, 1994).  \n \n 15\n However to return to matter is to \u2018speed-up\u2019 geography, to subject its analysis to the \nparticular infinity of physicality. In the first instance this is to refuse Miller\u2019s dualism \nbetween the excessiveness of material culture and the reductionism of language. Rather \nlanguage \u2013 as a physically embodied object of analysis \u2013 is itself internally unstable, a \ncomplex mixture of the abstract and the material (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987; Shields, \n1991). Secondly there is a need for the development of a tautological concept of \nmateriality \u2013 that matter matters because it MATTERS. That is the significance of matter \nis defined by the expressive action of matter \u2013 its signifying and representative capacity. \nThis is to suggest that current articulations must be more philosophically explicit in \nrefusing to allow the resurgence of notions of matter as a pure, original conditionality. \nIndeed any re-articulation of matter must break the logic of causation between the \nsubject and the object. There must be a valorisation of the ways in which matter acts \nindependently of and upon the subject. It is the diversity of material forms, its dirty, \nunwieldy, messiness that defines any contemporary interest in the material. In fact it is \nonly with a valorisation of the physically expansive action of matter that matter may well \nbe articulated on-its-own terms, rather than as a strategic sign for a return to the basics. \nSurprisingly this form of matter \u2013 on-its-own terms \u2013 is anything but Kantian, or insistent \nupon forms of absolute materiality. Rather it necessitates a notion matter as \nsimultaneously \u2013 and unevenly \u2013 discursive and physical. To activate a notion of matter \nas independently expressive is to suggest a fundamental interdwelling of the material and \nthe representational. This is then to rethink the modes of analysis and methodological \nassumptions common in human geography. There is a need to abandon the notion that \nempirical methods are necessarily about the capturing of the external world as data, \ninasmuch as there is a need to discard notions of geographical practice as necessarily \nproducing knowledge and representations of an external (and sometimes material) world. \nRather there is a need to re-invigorate geographical practice with a conception of \ncollaboration (Law, 1994). In producing knowledge geographical methods collaborate \nwith the external world, they invite certain temporary alliances between material orders. \nIn producing a re-materialised social and cultural geography matter does not simply \nbecome the subject of future investigation. Rather to produce material knowledge is, in \nBergson\u2019s (1908 [1991]) terms, to vary with matter itself. It is to engage the creative and \nexpressive potential of the material collaboratively.  As such it is possible to initiate a \nnotion of representation as material, as embodied and as problematically ontological. \nWhat matters about matter is not a simple and an unquestioned omnipresence but the \n 16\n \u2018reality\u2019 of matter\u2019s own discursive and representative expression. Thus in conclusion in \ncomposing a re-materialised geography \u2013 one that does not \u2018return\u2019 so much as \u2018re-ignite\u2019 \n\u2013 the philosophical and metaphysical commitments of this move must be explicit. In \ntalking of matter it is vital to define exactly what (or whose) kind of matter is enlivened.  \nAcknowledgments \nMany thanks to Dr Kathy Mee, Dr Pauline McGuirk and the productive comments made \nby members of the Institute of Australian Geographers Cultural Geography Study group \nregarding a presentation of this paper at the Institute of Australian Geographers Cultural \nGeography Study Group Meeting, December 2001, The University of Newcastle.

Rather by grouping them here I mean to highlight the explicit  reintroduction of matter (as well as \nthe physical into geographical analysis). \n3 This is to act upon Lees\u2019 (2002) call for a definition of matter, as she states: \u2018Defining what we actually \nmean by material and immaterial ought to be the first step in rematerializing geography.\u2019 (p.102). \n4 This dualism between language and material culture is especially apparent in Miller\u2019s work. Take for \nexample his (2002) critique of Callon\u2019s analysis of the market. Whilst the substance of this critique is not \nimportant here it is significant that in countering Callon he raises against him not only arguments but also \nan object. Indeed he challenges Callon\u2019s notion of the market by drawing upon his own previous analysis of \nthe Jajmani system of mutual exchange of objects and goods. In positioning this object \u2013 the subject of \nempirical and anthropological analysis \u2013 against Callon he again infers a kind of material excess that is \nsimply irreducible to a more theoretical (i.e. linguistic) account of the same phenomenon.  \n"}
