All three minisatellites are located in GC-rich DNA abundant in\ndispersed and tandem repetitive elements. There were no significant sequence similarities between different loci\nupstream of the unstable end of the repeat array. Only one of the three loci showed clear evidence for putative\ncoding sequences near the minisatellite. No consistent patterns of thermal stability or DNA secondary structure\nwere shared by DNA flanking these loci. This work extends previous data on the genomic environment of\nminisatellites. In addition, this work suggests that recombinational activity is not controlled by primary or\nsecondary characteristics of the DNA sequence flanking the repeat array and is not obviously associated with\ngene promoters as seen in yeast.\n[The sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank data library under accession\nnos. AF048727 (CEB1), AF048728 (MS31A), and AF048729 (MS32).]\nMinisatellites include some of the most unstable loci\nin the human genome and provide highly infor-\nmative systems for dissecting processes of tandem re-\npeat instability in the germline. Analysis of de novo\nmutant alleles identified in families or in single sperm\nhas shown that repeat instability most likely arises at\nmeiosis and can result in complex allelic rearrange-\nments (Jeffreys et al. 1994; Jeffreys and Neumann\n1997). For minisatellites MS31A, MS32, and MS205,\nthese rearrangements are dominated by gene conver-\nsion-like transfers of repeat units between alleles that\nare largely restricted to one end of the repeat array and\ndo not result in exchange of flanking markers (Armour\net al. 1993; Jeffreys et al. 1994; May et al. 1996). The\nhighly unstable minisatellite CEB1 similarly shows po-\nlar interallelic conversion but also complex and non-\npolar intraallelic rearrangements that nevertheless ap-\npear to be meiotic in origin, possibly arising by alter-\nnative processing of a recombination initiation\ncomplex (Buard and Vergnaud 1994; Buard et al.\n1998).\nAnalysis of MS31A and MS32 has shown that mei-\notic crossovers with exchange of flanking markers\ndo occur in sperm within the repeat array, though\nat a much lower frequency than for conversion (Jef-\nfreys et al. 1998b). Analysis of crossovers in DNA flank-\ning the unstable end of the MS32 locus has shown that\nthis minisatellite is located at the boundary of\nan intense and highly localized meiotic recombination\nhotspot ~ 1.5 kb long that reaches maximal activity\nabout 200 bp upstream of MS32 and extends into\nthe beginning of the repeat array, where it results\nin unequal and equal (in register) crossover between\nallelic arrays (Jeffreys et al. 1998a). Preliminary evi-\ndence at MS31A and CEB1 also suggests that cross-\nover activity is not restricted to the repeat array but\nextends into flanking DNA (C. Hollies and J. Buard,\nunpubl.).\nAt minisatellite MS32, a single base transversion\n(G fi C) at the O1 site 48 bp outside the repeat array\nand within the flanking recombination hotspot is\nstrongly associated with, and probably directly causes,\ncosuppression of array conversion, array crossover,\nand possibly flanking crossover in sperm (Monckton\net al. 1994; Jeffreys et al. 1998a,b). This cosuppres-\nsion provides strong evidence that minisatellite con-\nversion and crossover arise by a common mechanism\nsuch as alternative processing of a meiotic recombina-\ntion initiation complex and, further, suggests that re-\npeat instability is not an intrinsic property of the re-\npeat array but is instead controlled by recombination\ninitiation elements located outside the array and pre-\nsumably in or near the flanking hotspot (Jeffreys et al.\n1998a). The stabilizing MS32 O1C variant appears to\n1Corresponding author.\nE-MAIL ajj@le.ac.uk; FAX (0116) 252-3378.\nLetter\n130 Genome Research 9:130\u2013136 \u00a91999 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 1054-9803\/99 $5.00; www.genome.org\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nfunction by blocking the initiation of recombination.\nThis could occur by altering the binding site for\na recombinogenic protein; alternatives include the\nadventitious creation of a binding site for a protein\nthat interferes with recombination, or alteration of\na local open chromatin domain that normally pro-\nvides accessibility to the meiotic recombination ma-\nchinery.\nHuman minisatellites preferentially cluster in sub-\ntelomeric regions (Royle et al. 1988; Amarger et al.\n1998), which are involved in initiating meiotic chro-\nmosome pairing and are proficient in meiotic recom-\nbination. MS32 occupies an atypical interstitial posi-\ntion on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42-43),\nwhereas both MS31A (7p22-pter) and CEB1 (2q37.3)\nare in subtelomeric locations (Royle et al. 1988; Verg-\nnaud et al. 1991). Previous evidence suggested that\nhuman hypervariable minisatellites tend to occur in\nregions rich in dispersed repeats and often clustered\nwith other minisatellites (Armour et al. 1989; Verg-\nnaud et al. 1993), but little information exists on long-\nrange sequence organization around unstable minisat-\nellites. Therefore, cosmid clones containing MS31A,\nMS32, and CEB1 were isolated and sequenced to search\nfor features such as primary sequence similarity, sec-\nondary DNA structure, and gene elements that might\nbe associated with recombinational proficiency at\nthese loci.\nRESULTS\nSequencing Minisatellites\nCosmids containing minisatellites MS31A, MS32, and\nCEB1 were isolated and fully sequenced on both\nstrands, yielding 14, 19, and 24 kb of sequence up-\nstream of the unstable end of each locus, respectively,\nand 12, 10, and 13 kb of downstream flanking se-\nquence. Long PCR amplification of overlapping ge-\nnomic DNA fragments from regions flanking MS32\nand CEB1 and Southern blot analysis of MS31A flank-\ning sequences showed that all cosmid inserts were\nbona fide copies of genomic DNA without obvious re-\narrangement (data not shown). MS31A and CEB1 are\nlocated in highly GC-rich DNA (~ 60% and ~ 64% GC,\nrespectively) as predicted for GC-rich terminal iso-\nchores in human chromosomes. In contrast, the inter-\nstitial minisatellite MS32 is located in moderately GC-\nrich DNA (45% GC).\nRepetitive DNA\nMS31A and CEB1 are closely linked to other minisat-\nellites, particularly for CEB1 where there are six other\nminisatellites clustered within 12 kb of the 38 end of\nthe locus; none of these additional loci shows high\nlevels of variability (data not shown; Fig. 1). In con-\ntrast, there are no other minisatellites near MS32, per-\nFigure 1 Repeat elements surrounding human minisatellites CEB1, MS32 and MS31. Minisatellites (top) and other tandem and\ndispersed repetitive elements (bottom) are shown for each locus. The highly variable minisatellites CEB1, MS32 and MS31A are orientated\nwith the unstable end of the repeat array to the left. The closely linked minisatellite MS31B shows only modest variability. The orientation\nof dispersed repeats is indicated by arrows, with multiple dispersed repeats per box indicated by additional arrows.\nFlanking Sequences of Unstable Human Minisatell ites\nGenome Research 131\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nhaps reflecting its interstitial location. MS31A, MS32,\nand CEB1 are all surrounded by an abundance of\nsimple tandem repeat DNA and dispersed repeats,\nthough dispersed repeats are under-represented in the\nminisatellite-rich region of the CEB1 cosmid. Alu re-\npeats occur at a frequency four times the genome av-\nerage (one every 1 kb instead of one per ~ 4 kb; Schmid\nand Jelinek 1982), particularly surrounding MS32,\nwhere they make up 31% of the sequence. Alu repeats\nare less numerous near CEB1, and the 58 flanking DNA\nis instead dominated by MER repeats (Donehower et al.\n1989) that make up 20% of the upstream DNA. The Alu\nrepeats around all three loci vary in the age\nof their subfamilies, but none belongs to\nthe currently active group in humans (Mat-\nera et al. 1990).\nThe 38 flanking sequence of CEB1\nshowed strong homology beginning 129\nbp downstream of the minisatellite to a di-\nverged, but complete pseudo-autosomal\nboundary-like sequence (PABL-B subfam-\nily), with 87% sequence similarity over 662\nbp. The PABL sequence was initially found\nat the boundary of the pseudo-autosomal\nregion of the sex chromosomes and subse-\nquently at boundaries between megabase-\nlevel GC-rich and AT-rich isochores de-\nfined by chromosome walking and base\ncompositional analysis (Fukagawa et al.\n1995, 1996). At CEB1, the GC content\ngradually increases from ~ 40% GC in the\ndispersed repeat-rich region upstream of\nthe PABL to ~ 63% GC in the downstream\nminisatellite-rich region. Much more ex-\ntensive sequence analysis around CEB1\nwould be required to establish whether the\nCEB1-associated PABL genuinely consti-\ntutes an isochore boundary.\nDNA Sequence Comparisons\nTo determine whether the three minisatel-\nlite loci share sequence similarities outside\nthe repeat arrays, nonrepetitive sequences\nrepresenting 46% of the total DNA were\ncompared between loci by dot matrix\nanalysis. No regions of significant similar-\nity were found. Similarly, BESTFIT analysis\nyielded only small segments of similarity of\nmarginal significance; these segments\nshowed no consistent location common to\nall three loci (data not shown). Therefore,\nthere is no evidence for primary sequence\nsimilarities shared by these loci, in particu-\nlar over the DNA flanking the unstable end\nof the repeat array.\nThermal Stability Analysis\nThermal stability profiles were analyzed around each\nminisatellite (Fig. 2), using published models (Yeram-\nian et al. 1990) to determine whether there were con-\nsistent patterns of stability shared by the three loci. All\nthree minisatellites are extremely refractory to thermal\ndenaturation, reflecting their high GC content. The\nunstable end of MS32 is flanked by a 4-kb domain of\neasily opened DNA (defined for three given tempera-\ntures, Fig. 2); however, this domain starts 240 bp up-\nstream of the array and does not coincide in location\nwith the 1.5-kb MS32-associated recombination\nFigure 2 Thermal stability profiles of sequences surrounding minisatellite loci.\nThe local probability of DNA helix opening was determined for three different\ntemperatures per locus selected on the basis of overall base composition for each\nlocus. The highly variable minisatellites are orientated with the unstable end of the\nrepeat array to the left.\nMurray et al.\n132 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nhotspot that extends into the beginning of the repeat\narray (Jeffreys et al. 1998b). Similarly, the stabilizing\nO1C variant near MS32 lies outside the easily opened\ndomain and has no effect on thermal stability. The\nupstream flanking region of MS31A also shows a low\nstability domain; however, this region is short (390 bp)\nand does not immediately abut the minisatellite; no\ndata currently exist concerning recombination profiles\nsurrounding MS31A. Finally, the 3.5 kb of DNA imme-\ndiately upstream of CEB1 shows high thermal stability,\nthough there is an openable domain close to the 38 end\nof the minisatellite. Therefore, there is no consistent\npattern of thermal instability shared by the upstream\nflanking DNA of these loci.\nDNA Secondary Structure\nSecondary structure in DNA can be described by two\nparameters, namely the intrinsic flexibility of the DNA\nhelix (bendability) and the tendency of the helix to\nform a bent structure (curvature propensity) as a result\nfor example of purine\/pyrimidine strand asymmetry.\nData from Dnase I digestion and nucleosome position-\ning (Gabrielian and Pongor 1996) were used to predict\nbendability and curvature propensity around all three\nminisatellites. No consistent patterns shared by the\nflanking DNA of these loci were observed (data not\nshown). This analysis was extended to the immediate\nvicinity of the stabilizing O1C variant near minisatel-\nlite MS32 (Fig. 3) to determine whether this variant\nmight influence secondary structure in this region. The\nO1 site is located within a few base pairs of a region of\nrelatively low bendability, but the O1 G fi C transver-\nsion has no effect on flexibility. This region also shows\nvery low curvature propensity (<0.06 compared with\nthe genome average of 0.3; Gabrielian and Pongor,\n1996). The O1C variant enhances curvature over a\nsmall domain 10\u201320 bp upstream of the O1 site; how-\never, this enhancement is also seen if similar G fi C\nswitches are made in the vicinity of O1, indicating that\nthis effect is not specific to the O1 site (data not\nshown).\nPutative Genes\nThe Nix search engine (see Methods) was used to\nsearch for putative genes in the vicinity of minisatel-\nlites MS31A, MS32, and CEB1. There was no evidence\nfor coding regions or CpG islands near MS32. The\nMS31A flanking sequence yielded a 391-bp region\n99.5% identical in sequence to a phaeochromocytoma\nIMAGE cDNA clone (dbEST identification number\n1311250). This expressed sequence tag corresponds to\nthe 38 end of a clone from an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA\nlibrary and therefore, should correspond to a 38-\nuntranslated transcribed region (UTR). However, this\nregion, situated 1.8\u20132.2 kb downstream of the mini-\nsatellite, is not located near any predicted exons, there\nis no continuous open reading frame near the region of\nhomology, nor are there any polyadenylation signals,\nalthough about half of true 38 UTRs show no obvious\npolyadenylation signal. Therefore, it remains to be es-\ntablished whether this region contains a genuine ex-\npressed sequence, or whether it is part of a noncoding\nRNA gene, which cannot be detected by current exon\nprediction programs (Claverie 1997). Alternatively, the\nIMAGE clone may be a genomic contaminant.\nIn contrast, the CEB1 cosmid yielded two candi-\ndate genes (Fig. 4). The 58-flanking region produced a\nhighly significant BLAST\/trembl match (59% sequence\nsimilarity) to cerebroside sulphotransferase mRNA (ac-\ncession no. d88667). The matching regions coincided\nwith strong exon predictions from GRAIL\/exons (prob-\nFigure 3 Influence of the O1 G fi C polymorphism on bend-\nability and curvature propensity of DNA adjacent to the unstable\nend of the minisatellite MS32 repeat array. Secondary structural\nanalysis with the Bend.It Server was performed on 90 bp of MS32\nflanking DNA plus the diverged repeat unit (horizontal arrow)\nthat precedes the repeat array proper, with analyses repeated for\nthe O1G and O1C alleles that differ by a single base transversion.\nFlanking Sequences of Unstable Human Minisatell ites\nGenome Research 133\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nability score, 0.84) and GENEMARK (protein-coding\nexon probability, 0.94). Dot matrix comparisons de-\nfined two exons with open reading frames that to-\ngether cover 60% (1076 bp) of human cerebroside sul-\nphotransferase mRNA. The second exon terminates\n1175 bp upstream of the unstable end of CEB1. No\nhomologies to the remaining mRNA sequence were de-\ntected in the CEB1 cosmid, suggesting that this puta-\ntive gene is a highly diverged member of a sulphotrans-\nferase gene family or possibly a pseudogene. Similar\nanalysis of DNA flanking the 38 end of CEB1 revealed\nfour exons with homology (53% sequence similarity)\nto Chinese hamster sialidase mRNA (accession no.\nu06143), with the first exon commencing 6530 kb\ndownstream of CEB1. No homologies to the 58-\nuntranslated region of sialidase mRNA were detected,\npreventing localization of the gene promoter, assum-\ning that this gene is functional. There is a possible CpG\nisland just upstream of CEB1 that could mark the pro-\nmoter, but it is only 440 bp long, considerably shorter\nthan the bulk of gene-associated CpG islands (Bird\n1987).\nDISCUSSION\nHuman minisatellites preferentially cluster near hu-\nman telomeres in GC-rich isochores abundant in dis-\npersed repeats from which some VNTR loci such as\nMS32 have amplified (Royle et al. 1988; Armour et al.\n1989; Vergnaud et al. 1993; Amarger et al. 1998). Se-\nquence analysis of DNA around the proterminal mini-\nsatellites CEB1 and MS31A confirms their location in\nGC-rich domains containing minisatellite clusters and\nabundant dispersed repeats, reminiscent of the well-\ncharacterized VNTR-rich domain at 16pter that in-\ncludes the a-globin gene cluster (Flint et al. 1997). The\ninterstitial minisatellite MS32 is located in a less GC-\nrich domain and appears not to be a component of a\nVNTR cluster. Minisatellites MS31A, MS32, and CEB1\nall show common features of tandem repeat instability,\nwhich is largely restricted to the germline, appears to\nbe meiotic in origin, and frequently involves polar re-\ncombinational interactions between alleles resulting in\ninterallelic conversion or occasionally crossover (Buard\nand Vergnaud 1994; Jeffreys et al. 1994; Jeffreys and\nNeumann 1997; Buard et al. 1998). Detailed analysis of\nMS32 has shown that it is located at the boundary of a\nlocalized recombination hotspot (Jeffreys et al.\n1998a,b); preliminary data at MS31A and CEB1 suggest\nthat crossover activity similarly extends into DNA\nflanking the unstable end of the locus, although it re-\nmains to be established whether this flanking recom-\nbination activity is restricted to a localized hotspot as\nseen at MS32. Further evidence at MS32 strongly sug-\ngests that repeat instability is controlled in cis by as-\nyet-unidentified flanking DNA elements in the recom-\nbination hotspot (Jeffreys et al. 1998a).\nThe lack of significant sequence similarity between\nDNA flanking MS32, MS31A, and CEB1 suggests that\nthese flanking mutation\/recombination initiator ele-\nments will not be definable by primary DNA sequence.\nThis is concordant with data in yeast, which again\nshow lack of sequence similarity between different re-\ncombination hotspots (Rocco et al. 1992; deMassy and\nNicolas 1993; Goyon and Lichten 1993).\nIn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is a strong ten-\ndency for recombination hotspot-associated double-\nstrand breaks to localize to transcriptional promoters\n(Baudat and Nicolas 1997). The lack of obvious gene\nsequences near MS32 and MS31A suggests that this\nFigure 4 Putative genes near minisatellite CEB1. Predicted exons (bold boxes) related to cerebroside sulphotransferase and sialidase\ncoding sequences are shown relative to the location of CEB1 (arrow) and to mRNA sequences (below).\nMurray et al.\n134 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \ncorrelation may not necessarily apply to human re-\ncombination hotspots, though direct analysis of germ-\nline transcriptional activity near these minisatellites is\nrequired to clarify this issue. For CEB1, there is a puta-\ntive sialidase-related gene downstream of the locus\nwhose promoter could be near the end of the minisat-\nellite showing maximal recombination activity; how-\never, the location of the promoter and the functional\nstatus of the gene in the germline remain unknown.\nDouble-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recom-\nbination in fusion yeast tend to occur at or near sites of\nopen chromatin (Ohta et al. 1994; Wu and Lichten\n1994; Fan and Petes 1996), suggesting that as-yet uni-\ndentified DNA elements that control chromatin archi-\ntecture are responsible for creating the open chromatin\ndomains necessary for generating recombination\nhotspots by providing accessibility to the recombina-\ntion machinery. If minisatellite-associated recombina-\ntion hotspots in humans are associated with open\nchromatin domains, then such domains may be de-\ntectable in primary DNA sequences as regions showing\nunusual secondary structure or propensity to open the\nhelix. Thermal stability modelling shows the presence\nof regions near all three minisatellites that are intrin-\nsically more able to open the helix; however, these\nregions do not colocalize with the recombination\nhotspot near MS32, nor do they show a consistent pat-\ntern shared by all three loci, suggesting that the\nhotspot activity is not defined by relatively AT-rich do-\nmains (although the possibility remains of some role in\ninitiation of recombination).\nA common feature of GC-rich minisatellites is pu-\nrine\/pyrimidine strand asymmetry (Jeffreys et al.\n1985). GC-rich repeats from herpes simplex virus 1\n(HSV1) with a pronounced strand asymmetry have\nbeen shown to adopt unusual DNA conformations in\nplasmids in vivo (Wohlrab et al. 1991). However, cur-\nvature analysis on MS31A, MS32, and CEB1 as naked\nDNA (reflecting static molecular properties) shows that\nall three minisatellites will tend to adopt straight rigid\nstructures because their repeat unit periodicity pre-\nvents long-range curvature (E. Yeramian, in prep.).\nDNA flanking the minisatellites does show regions of\nsignificant curvature and bendability, but again there\nis no consistent pattern shared by all three loci. The O1\nG fi C transversion near MS32, which appears to be\ndirectly responsible for suppressing in cis the initiation\nof crossovers and conversion in and near the minisat-\nellite (Monckton et al. 1994; Jeffreys et al. 1998a,b),\ndoes influence curvature propensity nearby, and it is\npossible that this effect could affect nucleosome posi-\ntioning, and thus chromatin structure, as intrinsically\ncurved DNA is more readily wrapped around a histone\noctamer (Fitzgerald and Anderson 1998). Further\nanalysis of the chromatin structure of human meiotic\nrecombination hotspots will require the definition of\nadditional hotspots in the human genome and the de-\nvelopment of methods for probing chromatin architec-\nture in human meiotic cells.\nMETHODS\nCosmid Cloning and Sequencing\nThe isolation of cosmids containing minisatellites MS32 and\nCEB1 has been described previously (Vergnaud et al. 1991;\nBois et al. 1997). MS31A was isolated from a human cosmid\nlibrary constructed with the vector pAVCV007 (Choo et al.\n1986) by hybridization screening with an MS31A probe\n(Wong et al. 1987). Three cosmids were isolated, two extend-\ning upstream from the minisatellite and one extending down-\nstream. Appropriate cosmids were sonicated and 1.0- to 1.5-kb\nDNA fragments cloned into pBlueScriptII SK+. Ordered array\nshotgun clones were screened by hybridization with appro-\npriate cosmid restriction fragments covering regions to be se-\nquenced. Relevant phagemid DNAs were subjected to auto-\nmated sequencing with the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle\nSequencing Ready Reaction Kit and sequence data were as-\nsembled by use of ABI AutoAssembler software. Single-\nstranded regions were reanalyzed by reverse sequencing of\nPCR-amplified phagemid inserts and gaps closed by sequenc-\ning appropriate cosmid PCR products. Finished cosmid se-\nquences were complete on both strands.\nSequence Analysis\nKnown dispersed repeats were identified by use of the CEN-\nSOR software (Jurka et al. 1996). The Nix search engine pro-\nvided by the MRC Human Genome Mapping Programme\n(http:\/\/www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) was used to screen for putative\ncoding sequences and exons. DNA sequence comparisons by\ndot matrix and BESTFIT analysis were performed with the\nGCG package of software. Thermal stability curves were pro-\nduced by software written by E.Y. DNA secondary structural\nanalysis was carried out by the Bend.It Server (http:\/\/\nwww.icgeb.trieste.it\/dna\/bend_it.html).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Kathryn Lilley and Stuart Bayliss for oligo-\nnucleotide synthesis and assistance with automated sequenc-\ning, and to colleagues for helpful discussions.
