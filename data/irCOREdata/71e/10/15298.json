By categorising brands using \nfeatures of the Behavioral Perspective Model (specifically utilitarian and informational \nreinforcement) they were able to classify the purchasing behavior of consumers into six groups.  \nThey concluded that, \u201c\u2026..utilitarian and informational reinforcement have distinct effects on \nbrand choice and may form the basis of the partitioning of markets and strategies of market \nsegmentation.\u201d \n This paper seeks to further explore whether features of the Behavioral Perspective Model \ncan be used successfully for market segmentation and in what way, by exploring the purchasing \npattern of consumers in the UK cookies (known as biscuits in the UK) market.  This will firstly \nsegment by the six groups used above and also by consumer demographics. \n \nSegmentation \n \n Smith\u2019s (1956) idea of segmentation as the measurement and definition of market \ndifferences is as relevant today as when he first introduced it and is extensively taught in \nmarketing courses worldwide and well as being an integral part of modern marketing \nmanagement and marketing research (Wedel and Kamakura 2002).  Three main segmentation \napproaches are available both to researchers and marketing practioners.  The first of these bases, \nsegmentation by demographics, i.e. the age, gender, religion of consumers etc can also \naccommodate segmentation by geographic location.  The second approach is based on \npsychographics where the consumer\u2019s lifestyle allows segmentation.  The third is by benefits \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 5 \nsought by consumers which can be wide ranging including a range of lifestyle and product choice \nissues e.g. reliability, environmentally friendly etc.  This paper will concentrate on two of these \ntypes of segmentation with regards the brand choice and purchasing patterns of consumers:  \ndemographics and benefits sought (in terms of the comparative benefits of utilitarian and \ninformational reinforcement benefits received by consumers from brand they purchase).   \nDemographic segmentation is by far the most popular and prevalent form of segmentation \nas it allows consumers to be placed on definite, measurable scales which are easily understood \n(Beane and Ennis 1987) by both consumers and marketers alike.  However there are, and have \nlong been, mixed opinions in the literature as to whether demographic variables have predictive \npower with regard to brand choice (described by Uncles et al. (2006) as by far the most relevant \nlevel of analysis).  The use of demographic variables as an explanation for product choice, \ncategory choice, brand loyalty and price responsiveness\/elasticity have often been accused of \nover simplification.   \n Although some consumer behavior studies (Bearden et al. 1978, Sharpe et al. 1998 and \nLin 2002) have suggested that demographics are useful in segmenting markets, the majority of \nevidence, especially at the brand choice level of analysis does not support this.  For example, \nFennell et al. (2003) were not successful in associating either demographic (e.g. age, social \nclass\n1\n) or psychographic variables with brand choice in their model but did conclude that \ndemographics could successfully predict product category use, product use and frequency of use.  \nHammond at al. (1996) also suggested that demographics were not useful in segmenting \n                                                 \n1\n The class grouping system used in the UK is based on occupation.  Five groupings are used: A \u2013 Upper Middle \nClass: Managerial and Professional (typical occupations include: doctor, solicitor, barrister, accountant, company \ndirector), B \u2013 Middle Class: Managerial and Professional (typical occupations include: teacher, nurse, police officer, \nprobation officer, librarian, middle manager) C1 \u2013 Lower Middle Class: Supervisory and clerical (typical \noccupations include: junior manager, student, clerical\/office workers, supervisors), C2- Skilled working class: \nSkilled manual (typical occupations include: foreman, agricultural worker, plumber, bricklayer), D-Working Class: \nUnskilled manual (typical occupations include: manual workers, shop worker, fisherman, apprentices) and E-\nUnderclass\/unemployed (typical occupations include: casual labourers, state pensioners) \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 6 \nconsumers in terms of the brands they purchase and this was more recently supported by Uncles \net al. (2006) who also suggested that demographics could not be successfully used to predict \nbrand choice behavior. \n Within the area of demographic segmentation research, two of the most individually \nexplored variables are age and social class.  Age related segmentation has generally not been \nfound useful.  For example, Uncles at al. (2006) concluded brand purchasing was not age related \nand Simcock at al. (2006) suggested that more sophisticated age based segmentation was required \nbefore age had predictive capability.  Additionally no consistent effects have been generally \nfound for social class or income with regard to brand choice (Frank 1967, Hammond et al. 1996, \nScriven at al. 1999) with social class often being used as a proxy measure for income.  Some \nauthors however do relate socio-economic variables to price sensitivity.  Murphy (1978) found \nthat upper social class women buy less expensive brands from which he concluded they were \nmore price sensitive.  In comparison Ainsle at al. (1998) supported by Mulhern at al. (1998) \nfound that those with higher incomes (income again used as a surrogate for social class) were less \nprice sensitive, as supported by a number of other authors (Ainslie and Rossi 1998; Estelami and \nLehmann 2001; Jones and Mustiful 1996; Kalyanam and Putler 1997; Sirvanci 1993).  Gabor and \nGranger (1961) also found that price sensitivity was negatively related to social class, although \nMurphy (1978) disagreed with their findings.  Supporting Gabor and Granger, Kalyanam et al. \n(1997) concluded that there is a negative relationship between income and price sensitivity, \nwhereas Tellis (1988) in his meta analysis described price elasticity as significantly negative but \nmentioned that there was a greater sensitivity to price in the latter stages of the life cycle, i.e. for \nolder consumers.  Scriven et al. (1999) concluded the opposite and found that the under 45\u2019s were \nconsistently more sensitive to price change.  A number of studies also showed insignificant or no \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 7 \neffect of demographics on consumer price responsiveness (Bell et al. 1999; Boatwright et al. \n2004; George et al. 1996; Kim et al. 1999; Scriven and Ehrenberg 2004). \n The obvious confusion and lack of consensus in the literature is made more difficult when \nprice sensitivity is also said to differ across categories (Kim 1999) and that it is not constant \nacross time anyway (George et al. 1996).  It has also been suggested that the segments \nthemselves may not be stable over time (see Fonseca and Cardoso 2007 for a discussion of \nstability in segmentation).  Granzin (1981) suggests a simple solution to the problem linking in \nwith Simcock et al.\u2019s (2006) call for more sophisticated segmentation- choose other variables to \nwork alongside demographics resulting in greater predictive power.  This research attempts to use \nutilitarian reinforcement and informational reinforcement (concepts borrowed from the \nBehavioral Perspective Model or BPM) alongside demographic variables to explore brand choice \nand price sensitivity segmentation.  \n Segmentation by benefits sought is slightly more complicated than those segmentations \nbased upon demographics.  It involves aggregation of individuals in a market into groups that \nseek similar benefits when choosing a brand or product (Orth et al. 2004).  Benefits sought for \nproducts can range from a car being reliable or practical to environmentally friendly or a status \nsymbol.  Fast moving consumer goods may be used for a variety of different purposes and \ncircumstances and consumer may demand a range of different variables from even the simplest \nproduct.  This type of segmentation has been used to explore, amongst many others, consumers \npurchases of beer (Orth et al. 2004), financial services (Chang and Chen 1995), cinema audiences \n(Cuadrado and Frasque 1999), on-line consumers (Wu 2001, Bhatnager, and Chose 2004) and \ntourists (Sarigollu and Huang 2005).  However, benefits that consumers seek from fast-moving \nconsumer goods are comparatively under-researched (Orth et al. 2004). \n \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 8 \nThe Behavioral Perspective Model \n The Behavioral Perspective Model (BPM), a model developed by Foxall (e.g. 1990) and \nbased on behavioral psychology, suggests that the most important determinant of behavior is the \nenvironmental consequences it produces.  Within the model the distinction is made between two \ntypes of reinforcement, utilitarian reinforcement and informational reinforcements both of which \nare expected to influence consumer choices.  Utilitarian reinforcement is the more practical \nnature of products\/services, the economic or material consequences derived from acquiring, \nowning and using a product.  For example the utilitarian benefit of using a car is its capacity to \nget you from a to b and protect you from the poor weather etc.  Informational reinforcement in \ncomparison is socially driven and symbolic, depending above all on the actions and reactions of \nother people.  Premium car brands (e.g. Bentley, Ferrari) will therefore afford the owner more \ninformational reinforcement than less socially conspicuous brands (e.g. Hyundai, Lada).      \nTherefore informational reinforcement is linked to a degree to the branding of a product and its \ndifferentiation from other products. A full exposition of all aspects of the BPM can be found in \nFoxall (1996, 2005, 2007) and Foxall, Oliveira-Castro, James and Schrezenmaier (2007).  Orth et \nal. (2004), discussing benefits-sought segmentation, suggested that products as well as brand \nnames are capable of contributing to several types of benefit to the consumer.  The major \ndifference between product and brand consists in that a product is \u201csomething that offers a \nfunctional benefit\u201d (which is akin to utilitarian reinforcement) while the brand is \u201ca name, \nsymbol, design or mark that enhances the value of a product beyond its functional value\u201d (which \nis akin to informational reinforcement).   \n \nPrevious Research \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 9 \n Previous research has used both utilitarian and informational reinforcement to classify \nboth brands, by the range of benefits they offer, and also consumers, by the benefits of the brands \nwhich they purchase most often (Foxall at al. 2004, Oliveira-Castro, Foxall and Schrezenmaier \n2005).  Foxall et al. (2004), utilizing a sample of 80 consumers, separated informational \nreinforcement into three levels and utilitarian reinforcement into two levels (detail of this \nmethodology can be found in the paper with a short summary in the methodology section below).  \nThey found that the majority of consumers in the majority of product categories made the \nmajority of their purchases within the same utilitarian level and the same informational level.  It \nwas also observed that consumers tended to buy brands at adjacent informational levels more \nthan at more distinct levels (e.g. buying Levels 1 and 2 more than Levels 1 and 3).  They also \nused price elasticities to explore consumers\u2019 price sensitivity to changes in utilitarian and \ninformational reinforcement and found that utilitarian price elasticity was higher for consumers \nwho purchased low utilitarian level brands than for those purchasing higher utilitarian level.  \nThey also found that when consumers were classified in six groups on the basis of the \ninformational\/utilitarian level of the brands they bought most, the groups showed distinctly \ndifferent responses to changes in price.  They concluded that \u201cconsumers choose their repertoire \nof brands on the basis of the informational and utilitarian level of reinforcement programmed by \nbrands\u201d and as stated earlier they suggested that these types of reinforcement could form a base \nfor the portioning of markets and strategies of market segmentation. \n Oliveira-Castro et al. (2005) took the research further concluding that consumers were in \nfact more responsive to utilitarian benefits than informational benefits.  They suggested that this \nwas not surprising due to the low prestige and, hence, low informational reinforcement related to \nsupermarket or fast moving consumer good products.  Although these previous studies began to \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 10 \nexplore the possible benefit patterns consumers exhibited, they used small samples of consumers, \nwhich may limit conclusions stemming from them. \nBased upon this previous line of research, the present paper investigates the possibility of \nusing utilitarian and informational reinforcement as a base for consumer segmentation. This was \ndone by examining the relations between consumers\u2019 brand choice patterns, their demographic \ncharacteristics and the levels of utilitarian and informational reinforcement, offered by brands, \nthat they bought predominantly. Brand choice patterns were examined with respect to consumers\u2019 \nsensitivity to price, informational and utilitarian reinforcement. Thus, the present research \ninvestigates whether similar types of brands (in terms of the utilitarian\/informational \nreinforcement they offer to consumers) have the same types of buyers (in terms of demographic \nand brand choice features), and whether consumers that buy the same types of brands have \nsimilar demographic characteristics and brand choice patterns. The study concentrates on one \nproduct class, biscuits as this provided the largest sample of data for a single product class. \n \nMethodology \n Data for the study was obtained from the ACNeilsen Homescan\u2122 panel and covered 52 \nweeks of purchases from July 2004 to July 2005 in four product categories Biscuits, Baked \nBeans, Fruit Juice and Yellow Fats (butter\/margarine) although only the results for biscuits will \nbe reported here.  Basic data for the other three product categories can be found in James, Chang, \nOliviera-Castro and Foxall (2008).  The data included 1847 panelists who made a total of 76,682 \npurchases of biscuits.  The data was a random sample from the approximately 14,000 households \nwho contribute to the AC Nielsen Homescan\u2122 panel.  Panellists use hand-held barcode scanners \nto record details of purchases and the purchasing data from each household is delivered to \nACNielsen\u2019s mainframe computer.  \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 11 \nAs well as brand purchased the dataset includes a panel ID number for each purchaser, the \nproduct subcategory purchased, brand specifics, the shopping trip by week, the store visited, the \nweight of the purchased item, package size, price per pack, the number of packs bought, the \namount spent on each purchase and demographics. The demographics supplied information on \nage, household social class (AB, C1, C2, D, and E) and working status by working hours (30 or \nmore hours per week, less than 30 hours per week and not working).  \nIn order to eliminate the pack-size effect and obtain comparable results for the amount \nbought and the price paid of each brand, a general denominator was adopted in this study. The \namount bought divided by 100 grams etc denoted the number of units. In the same way, the \naverage price per unit for each brand was calculated as the money spent divided by the number of \nunits for each brand. \n \nMeasures \nUtilitarian and informational benefits \nAs noted earlier brands can be classified based on their levels of utilitarian and \ninformational reinforcement.  In line with earlier research (Foxall et al. 2004, Oliveira-Castro et \nal. 2005) utilitarian reinforcement was separated into two levels. Utilitarian level 2 is higher than \nutilitarian level 1 and the higher level represents the addition of supposedly desirable benefits \nand\/or attributes.   Plain versions of products and simpler types of products (such as plain \nbiscuits, plain baked beans etc) were classified as belonging to Level 1 whereas more \ndifferentiated versions and those with more attributes (such as chocolate chip cookies or \nchocolate coated biscuits, baked beans with added sausages etc were classified as level 2.  More \ndetail on this method is included in Oliveira-Castro et al. (2005).  \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 12 \nEarlier research (Foxall et al. 2004, Oliveira-Castro et al. 2005) used a method of placing \nbrands in three informational levels by price and brand value in terms of store versus premium \nbrands (more detail can be found in Foxall et al. 2004).  This approach is overly dependant on \nprice so in the study the measure of informational reinforcement is based on the methodology \nfirst put forward by Oliveira-Castro, Foxall, James, Pohl, Dias and Chang (2008) which uses a \nsimple questionnaire to estimate consumer perceptions of the degree of quality and knowledge of \nbrands within any product class. Informational value was still measured on a three point scale \nwith level 3 as the highest level of informational reinforcement available.  The procedure \ninvolved a questionnaire that required groups of experienced consumers to evaluate how well \nknown a brand is and its quality level, with both dimensions measured on a four point scale (0 to \n3).  By averaging the obtained values on both scales across consumers, an overall informational \nlevel (termed MKQ (Mean Knowledge and Quality)) was calculated for each brand (the full \nprocedure, development and testing of this scaling is included in Oliveira-Castro, Foxall, James, \nPohl, Dias and Chang (2008)). \nThe four questionnaires, one for each product class, were given out to 33 consumers in \nOctober 2006.  The sample was chosen by convenience with the only criteria being that the \nrespondents had sufficient experience of the British fast moving goods market.  The respondents \nwere considered as expert judges in this study and therefore the sample size was deemed \nappropriate.  To assess the reliability of the MKQ analysis three split samples were analysed.  \nEach groups average MKQ was correlated with the average MKQ across all groups and across \nthe whole sample.  Pearson correlations ranged from 0.917 to 0.981 indicating good reliability \nacross the sample.  \nTo aid data analysis, a similar number of data points were used for each level of \ninformational benefits.  The informational benefits were separated into 3 levels by dividing the \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 13 \nscores as follows: level 1, MKQ scores between 0 and 1.5, level 2, MKQ scores between 1.6 and \n2.3 and level 3, MKQ scores above 2.3. \nConsidering that brands could be classified in one of two values of utilitarian level (1 or 2) \nand in one of three levels of informational level, it was then possible to group brands relating to \ntheir combination of utilitarian and informational levels and then to categorise consumers in \nterms of the group in which they made the majority of their purchases.  Table 1 presents the \ngroupings. \n--  Insert Table 1 here  -- \n \nAnalyses \n Only those consumers who purchased biscuits 7 or more times during the data collection \nperiod were included in the study.  This resulted in 75151 purchases being analysed.  Brand \nchoice patterns of each consumer group, classified according to demographic variables and \ninformational-utilitarian grouping (see table 1), were compared and explored using two \nregression equations.  The first assessing overall price elasticity\/sensitivity and the second in \nterms of demand elasticities based on price, informational level and utilitarian level of brands.  \nThe first analysis used the following equation: \n                      Log Quantity = a - b (log Price)                                                                               (1) \nwhere: \nLog Quantity = Log (the number of 100g or units bought of each brand) \nLog Price = Log (the average price of each brand) \nThe second analysis used the following regression equation: \n \nLog Quantity = a - b1 (log Intra-Brand price) \u2013 b2 (log Utilitarian Level) \u2013 \n                         - b3 (log Informational Level)                                                                              (2)                    \n \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 14 \nwhere: \n \nLog Quantity =  Log (the number of 100g or units bought on each shopping \noccasion) \nLog Intra-Brand Price =  Log (the price paid for the purchased brand on each \nshopping occasion divided by the average price for that \nsame brand across all consumers\/purchase occasions in the \nsample) \nLog Utilitarian Level=  Log (utilitarian Level of the brand purchased on each \nshopping occasion)  \nLog Informational Level =  Log (informational level of the brand purchase on each \nshopping occasion)  \n \nIntra-brand price provides a ratio determining how similar the price paid on that day is to the \naverage price of the brand and therefore takes into account levels of price fluctuation and price \npromotions.  It also provides an extended measure of the consumers\u2019 price sensitivity (or \nelasticity of demand).   If the value of this coefficient is negative this suggests that consumers are \ninversely sensitive to intra-brand price.  That is, as the brand price increases consumers reduce \nthe quantity they purchase.  Logarithmic transformations are used throughout to obtain linearity.  \nANOVA analyses were also used to explore possible differences among consumer groups (social \nclass, age group and working status) of mean brand values of utilitarian reinforcement, \ninformational reinforcement, average price paid (per 100g or equivalent unit) and quantity \npurchased.  \n \nResults \nTable 2 to 4 are included as Appendix One and contain a summary of the results based on \nEquation 1 (table 2) and Equation 2 (tables 3 and 4).  Table 2, presenting the parameters of \nequation one is split into five sections, firstly data from the whole samples and two split samples \n(section 2.1), secondly an analysis based on the groupings presented in table 1 (section 2.2), \nthirdly an analysis based on social class (section 2.3), fourthly by age (section 2.4) and finally by \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 15 \nworking status (section 2.5).  Tables 3 and 4, present the parameters of equation 2.  Table 3 \ncontains the calculations for all consumers and two split samples.  Table 4 contains calculations, \nin four sections, firstly using the groupings in table 1 (section 4.1), secondly an analysis based on \nsocial class groupings (section 4.2), thirdly by age groupings (table 4.3) and finally by working \nstatus (section 4.4).  \nIn terms of results from the overall sample all the analyses are statistically significant all with \nnegative coefficients suggesting that people are negatively sensitive to the prices of biscuits \noverall.  The majority of regressions for the segments explored are statistically significant with \nadjusted R\n2\ns ranging from 0.281 to 0.412 (sections 2.2 to 2.5).  Across the 6 groupings all the \ncoefficients are negative suggesting a negative sensitivity to price changes (section 2.2). The \nabsolute values of the elasticity coefficients tell us more about the different patterns across \nsegments.  Figure 1 shows these in more detail.  Consumers who belong to groups where they \nbuy a medium levels of brands with both utilitarian and informational reinforcement the higher \ntheir price sensitivity.  The pattern for social class is less clear with classes C1 and D showing \nhigher levels of sensitivity to prices.  In terms of age, older consumers show less price sensitivity \nalong with those not working.   \nWhen separated into social classes, all the regressions are statistically significant (p < \n0.000) (section 4.2). The adjusted R\n2 \nvalues are small and it may therefore be suggested that other \nsignificant variables may be useful in explaining the consumers\u2019 behavior.   The Variance \nInflation Factors (VIF) from all fifteen elasticity coefficients are less than 1.02, which indicates \nthat no significant correlation exists among all explanatory variables and there is no problem with \nmulticollinearity.  \nThe intra-brand elasticity coefficients for these five social classes, ranges from -0.35 to -\n0.562 suggesting that consumers are inelastic to intra-brand prices. As can be seen in Figure 2 the \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 16 \nabsolute values of the intra-brand elasticity coefficient for the households of social class D and E \nare smaller than the ones for the households of social class AB, C1 and C2.   \n--  Insert Figure 2 here  -- \nIn contrast all the informational inter-brand elasticities separated by social group are \npositive and vary from 0.024 to 0.095. Interestingly, the lower the social class of households the \nlower the informational inter-brand coefficient values. The utilitarian inter-brand elasticity \ncoefficients for these five social groups are all positive except for those households segmented as \nsocial class E.  Additionally, the utilitarian inter-brand coefficients for the households of social \nclass AB, C1 and C2 are higher than the ones for the households of social class D and E.  \nFigure 3 summaries the ANOVA results which indicate that the households of higher \nsocial class, on average, spend more money buy more brands at higher informational levels.  \nHowever, the mean values of utilitarian level for the households of social class C2 and D are \nsignificantly higher than the values for the households of social class AB, C1 and E exhibiting an \ninverse U-shape. \n--  Insert Figure 3 here  -- \nIt is also interesting to note that the absolute values of the intra-brand elasticities for the \nhouseholds of the five social classes are larger than the values of the utilitarian and informational \nelasticities as a whole, indicating that all panellists of different social classes are more sensitive to \nprice (although the lower social classes are least sensitive to price) than utilitarian and \ninformational benefits (supporting Foxall et al. (2004) and Oliveira-Castro et al. (2005)).  \nWith respect to the four age groups in which the consumers were separated, all regressions \nstatistically significant (p < 0.000). The adjusted R\n2 \nvalues differ from 0.028 to 0.03 which shows \na similar pattern to when the consumers are separated by social class.  In terms of \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 17 \nmulticollinearlity, the values of Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) from all twelve elasticity \ncoefficients are smaller than 1.02, indicating that all independent variables are not related.   \nAll elasticity coefficients (b1, b2 and b3) are significant except the utilitarian inter-brand \nelasticity coefficient of the oldest group aged over 70 years. The intra-brand elasticity \ncoefficients for the four age groups, varying from -0.255 to -0.561, are all significantly negative \nand inelastic to the intra-brand prices. As displayed in figure 4, the absolute value of the intra-\nbrand elasticity coefficient is lowest for oldest group aged over 70 years but largest for the \nmiddle-aged groups (31-50 years).   \n--  Insert Figure 4 here  -- \nIt appears that overall, the older groups are most responsive to increases in informational \nlevel of brands suggesting that the older people will be more likely to buy larger amounts of \nhigher differentiated brands to obtain higher informational benefits.  In comparison apart from \nthe oldest group the utilitarian inter-brand elasticity coefficients are positive. Specifically, the \nutilitarian elasticity values reduce as the ages increase. \nFigure 5 summarises the ANOVA results which demonstrate that younger people spend \nless overall, pay higher prices and purchase smaller quantities of higher utilitarian-level and \nlower informational-level brands, whereas older people spend more and buy larger amounts of \nlower utilitarian-level and higher informational-level brands.  \n--  Insert Figure 5 here  -- \nWith regards the working status of consumers, all regressions were statistically significant (p < \n0.000). The adjusted R\n2 \nvalues were again small and with earlier results, ranging between 0.032 \nand 0.063.  Regarding multicollinearlity, the values of Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) from all \nnine elasticity coefficients are smaller than 1.02, indicating that the independent variables are not \nsignificantly correlated.   \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 18 \nAll elasticity coefficients (b1, b2 and b3) are statistically significant except the utilitarian \nelasticity coefficients of groups working less than 30 hours per week and groups who are not \nworking.  The intra-brand elasticity coefficients in terms of working status, varying from -0.378 \nto -0.577, are all negative. As presented in figure 5, the absolute value of the intra-brand elasticity \ncoefficient is lowest for the non-working group.   \nIn comparison, the informational inter-brand elasticities for all working groups are all positive \nwith the absolute values suggesting that those consumers who comprise the non-working group \nare more responsive to the changes in informational levels.  \nThe utilitarian inter-brand elasticity coefficient for the group working at least 30 hours per \nweek the largest. It is also worth noting that the working people are likely to buy larger amounts \nof higher utilitarian-level brands, while the non-working people tend to purchase more quantities \nof lower utilitarian-level brands. Interestingly, the utilitarian elasticity coefficients decrease as the \namount of work decreases, whereas the informational elasticity coefficients increase as the \namount of work decreases.    \nThe results of one-way ANOVA, contained in Figure 6, indicate that the non-working \ngroup pay lower prices, buy larger quantities of higher informational-level and lower utilitarian-\nlevel brands.  \n--  Insert Figure 6 here  -- \nAdditionally, the absolute values of the intra-brand elasticities for all three working groups are \nlarger than the values of the utilitarian and informational elasticities, suggesting all panellists are \nmore sensitive to price than to the changes of the levels of utilitarian and informational benefits.  \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 19 \n In summary, all consumers are sensitive to price changes.  Different social classes are \napproximately equally sensitive as are those of different working status.  In term of age, younger \nconsumers are more sensitive with those under 50 showing the greatest price sensitivity.  In terms \nof brand benefits purchased there is little difference in price sensitivity.  In general consumers are \nmore sensitive to price changes (intra-brand) above changes in utilitarian and informational \nreinforcement or benefits.  This is consistent with the results of Foxall et al. (2004) and Oliveira-\nCastro et al. (2005).  In terms of intra-brand price consumers are increasing more sensitive the \nhigher the levels of utilitarian and informational benefit which they purchase.  Higher age groups \nand those not working are least sensitive to price changes, which is perhaps surprising.  Lower \nage groups are most sensitive to changes in utilitarian reinforcement as well as those not working.  \nSensitivity to informational benefits increases as consumers favour products which contain more \nof these types of benefits, as social class increases, and as the number of hours consumers work \ndecreases. \n The study has added to the literature on demographic segmentation, suggesting that at \nleast in terms of age, social class and working status demographic variables can be useful.  Social \nclass is perhaps the least useful of these variables in predicting sensitivity to prices and other \nbenefits.  The results support Scriven at al. (1995) who found that under 45\u2019s were more sensitive \nto price.  The research has also extended the idea that benefits sought in terms of \ninformational\/utilitarian reinforcement is useful, especially when looking at the sensitivities of \ndifferent demographic groups.  This requires further refinement and exploration but is useful both \nto marketers and consumer researchers. \n As in Foxall at al. (2004) groups of consumers (segmented by the brand benefits they \npurchased) showed different sensitivities to price although the reasons behind these differences \nrequire further exploration.  In opposition to this work this research suggested that those \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 20 \nconsumers who purchased at lower utilitarian levels were least sensitive to changes in these \nbenefits (see table 4, section 4.1).  This however may be a difference related to this specific \nproduct class (an idea put forward by James et al. 2008) and may be related to the difference in \nsamples sizes as the earlier work used a smaller sample of 90 consumers\u2019 purchases.  In support \nof Oliveira-Castro et al. (2005) this research also found that in general consumers were more \nresponsive to utilitarian benefits than informational benefits, perhaps due to the expected low \nprestige of fmcgs\n2\n in general. \n The adjusted R\n2\n values throughout range from approximately 0.2 to 0.45 suggesting that \nother variables than those studied affect the choice made by consumers.  It was not the objective \nof this study to discover every variable affecting the consumers\u2019 behavior or to assume that the \nthree variables studied, price, informational and utilitarian reinforcement, would explain all \nconsumer behavior so this is not particularly a problem.  However in future research it might be \nuseful to explore what else, beyond the variables studied here might fill the remaining gap in \nexplanation.  As every segmentation model is \u201cat best a workable approximation of reality\u201d \n(Wedel and Kamakura 2002) it should not overly worry us that any particular segmentation \nmodel does not provide full explanation of the behavior in view. \nMarket segments are not real entities naturally occurring in the market place, but \ngroupings created by managers of how managers view the market to help them develop strategies \nthat better meet consumer needs at the highest expected profit for the firm (Wedel and Kamakura \n2002). Segmentation strategies can help- managers look for new product opportunities, create \nimproved advertising\/promotional messages (Beane and Ennis 1987) and overall can provide a \ncloser matching with consumers (Sharp, Romaniuk and Cierpicki 1998). The question therefore \n                                                 \n2\n Fast Moving Consumer Goods are products sold quickly at relatively low cost.  This is includes many products \nfound at supermarket and convenience stores such as bread, milk, tinned goods etc. \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 21 \nthat should be asked is how useful would the types of segmentations discussed and explored \nabove be for marketing managers.  The utilitarian\/informational segmentation approach might be \nuseful in assessing gaps in the markets.  How far do competitors go in providing consumers with \ninformational\/utilitarian benefits and want level do consumers want (and are willing to pay for).  \nTellis (1988) suggests that marketers can attempt to reduce price sensitivity through product \ndifferentiation and advertising.  The analyses could provide information about specifically which \nbenefits consumers are more sensitive about as well as providing a base for competitor analysis, \npositioning strategy and for a better allocation of resources between alternative strategies \n(Bearden et al. 1978). \n Because the research into the effects on price is related to a comparison between prices \nthis paper should also provide marketers with information on which to base price promotions \nwhich are very common in the UK biscuits market and across the fmcg sector overall.  Marketers \nneed to bear in mind that the repeated price-promotion may cause lower reference prices. It is \nalso useful for marketers that its has been found consistently that consumers from all age groups \nand whatever brands they buy are more sensitive to price (intra-brand) than both utilitarian and \ninformational reinforcement.  \nThe limit of this particular paper is that it concentrates on only one product class.  It is not \nassumed at any point that the results and exploration here would translate across product class \ndirectly and this will certainly require further research to determine.  The UK biscuits market is a \nhighly competitive fast moving industry and therefore will have different characteristics from not \nonly other fast moving consumer goods but other types of goods.  Early exploration extending the \nanalyses across products classes (James et al. 2008) suggests there are observable differences \nacross different fast moving consumer goods.  It may be possible that choice patterns in action \nfor certain types of products may be significantly different from other products around them.  It \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 22 \nmight be the case for example that consumers are more sensitive to informational reinforcement \nin certain products.  This may be expected in status driven products but these differences could \noccur even between supermarket products.  This is certainly an area which will require still \nfurther explanation, to ensure reliability in transference to other products. \nSingle demographic variables, although useful may provide more predictive accuracy and \nsegmentation worth when combined.  For example future research could combine the variables \nused in the analyses above.  What are the age separations with each social class and working \nstatus etc and could these smaller sub-categorisations provide greater predictive strength etc.  The \naddition of other variables may also be useful in further analyses, for example: income, family \nsize etc.   \nThe study has attempted to introduce and further test what could be a simple, yet robust \ntechnique for exploration and also act as a segmentation technique.  It is not overly complicated \nalthough does need refinement, as with many segmentation models and allows managers \nflexibility in their use of the concepts employed.  The brand benefits outlined are measurable, \navailable and have the ability to uncover characteristics of market segments: the three areas \nemphasised by Lin (2002) as vital in segmentation. \nMarket Segmentation in Behavioural Perspective     Page 23 \nReferences \nAinslie, A and Rossi, P E (1998) \u201cSimilarities in Choice Behavior across Product Categories\u201d, \nMarketing Science, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp 91-106. \nBeane, T P and Ennis, D M (1987) \u201cMarket Segmentation: A Review\u201d, European Journal of \nMarketing, Vol. 21, pp 20-42. \nBearden, W O, Teel, J E and Durand, R M (1978) \u201cMedia Usage, Psychographic and \nDemographic Dimensions of Retail Shoppers\u201d, Journal of Retailing, Vol. 54, No. 1, pp \n65-74. \nBell, D R., Chiang, J and Padmanabhan, V.
