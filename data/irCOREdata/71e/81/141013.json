For example, in February 2008, there were 1,436 press articles published,\nof which 683 focused on stock options, whilst 212 focused on workers' cooperatives\n(EFESO, 2008). There have also been a growing number of academic articles in the\nlast few years, particularly in the U.S., where Employee Stock Ownership (ESO) or\nrather Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) diversification is an issue of concern.\nSuch interest has been stimulated in part by the governments in North America, Europe,\nAustralia and Asia promoting various forms of employee share ownership through a\nvariety of schemes which, in turn, have resulted in considerable differences in the practice\nof employee participation between countries. Thus making generalizations about\nemployee share ownership has to be done with considerable caution.\nFurthermore, employee ownership terminology usage in the literature is not always\nclear and, at times, is confusing as articles refer to \u2018employee stock ownership;\u2019\n\u2018employee\u2019s financial participation; \u2018profit sharing;\u2019 \u2018sharing ownership;\u2019 and\n\u2018employee ownership\u2019. Equally, what exactly constitutes an ESOP varies. A narrow\ndefinition is one where at least one employee receiving payment from an ESOP deems\nthe firm as an employee stock ownership (ESO) employing company (Sengupta et al,\n2007). A less restricted definition requires that a majority of non-managerial employees\nparticipate in the scheme for the company to be considered ESO employing (Robinson\nand Zhang, 2005). A broad-based definition theoretically covers the entire workforce.\nHowever, as most schemes never have 100 per cent coverage at any given time, since\nparticipation in the scheme calls for a minimum employment period, in practice, an ESO\ncompany is considered as such if a minimum of 50 per cent of the employees are\ncovered by an ESO scheme (Pendleton, 2001).\n3Yet, despite the variance of interpretation and practice, ESOPs are the longest-\nestablished method for sharing ownership (Blasi et al, 2002). As such, employees\nacquire equity shares thus permitting them a shareholding in their employing\ncompany. For the majority of cases, employee share ownership plans consist of one of\nseveral components of the company\u2019s reward package. Additionally, employee ownership\nmay come about through an employee buy-out or through the exiting owner wanting to\npass on the business to the employees. In theory, employee ownership provides\nemployees with additional rights, such as the right to share in the company\u2019s profits,\naccess to information about the company\u2019s finances and operations and the right to\nparticipate in the management of the company (Rousseau and Shperling, 2003). These\nrights are intended to bring about fundamental changes in employee attitudes and\nbehaviour, which may be reflected in a range of company-level outcomes such as\nimproved productivity and financial performance (Rousseau and Shperling, 2003).\nIt was Sydney Webb (1912: 232) who noted that making an employee a shareholder\nin the business would \u2018stimulate his zeal and careful working and, as part owner of the\ncapital, with which he works,\u2019 he will share responsibility in the business. Developed\nfurther as a concept in the 1950s by the lawyer and investment banker Louis Kelso,\nthe ESOP was introduced in 1973 under the premise that the capitalist system would\nbe stronger if all workers, and not just a few stockholders, could share in owning\ncapital-producing assets and that tax benefits for ESOPs should be permitted and\nencouraged under employee benefit law (NCEO, 2008d). Thus, the assumption made\nis that sharing equity with most or all employees in a corporation is one way of\ngaining employees\u2019 involvement in profit-sharing programs (Blasi et al, 2002).\n4However, the extent to which employees enjoy profit-sharing and information and\nparticipation rights varies considerably (Ben-ner and Jones, 1995; French, 1987) and\nthat is considered to be a reason that the benefits from employee ownership vary\nsubstantially.\nAs emphasized, there exist various modes of employee ownership. At one end of the\nspectrum are workers\u2019 co-operatives, whilst the other end is populated by executive\nshare-options. With the latter, participation in share ownership plans may be limited\nto just a few individuals, typically senior managers, or can be open to the entire\nworkforce. Still, the assumption underling both profit-sharing and employee-\nownership is that the better re-distribution of the benefits of economic growth itself\nstimulates greater and continued economic growth (Lowitzsch, et al 2008). Broadly,\nthree sets of schemes can be distinguished.\nDirect: Through using one or more share plans, employees become registered as the\nshareholders of a majority of the shares in their company. In order to do so,\nemployees may acquire shares over time, perhaps as bonuses or as part of their\nremuneration. Some share schemes offer tax advantages to the company and\nemployees. Alternatively, the shares in the company could initially be bought by an\nemployee trust which later are distributed, in part or whole to individual employees.\nAs a result shares may be held individually or collectively. In the UK, there are three\nmain types of non-cash, profit sharing schemes: Approved profit sharing; Save as You\nEarn (SAYE) schemes, also referred to as savings-related share- option schemes or\n\u2018share-save\u2019 schemes (initially established under the terms of The Finance Act 1980);\n5and Company share options schemes. For these schemes to be put into operation,\nclear agreement needs to be reached between employer and employees. Employees\nmust receive their shares in addition to their wages or salaries; the share price must be\nfixed beforehand and the employees' shares must be related to profits (Morris et al,\n2006). Whilst cash schemes are the simplest method of distributing profits to\nemployees, share options schemes, on the other hand, provide links between\nindividual rewards and organizational success in profit terms more on a long-term\nbasis (Morris et al, 2006).\nIndirect: In this case, shares are held collectively on behalf of employees, normally\nthrough an employee trust. An indirect model of employee-ownership is through a co-\noperative structure (such as the Industrial and Provident Society structure) which\nprovides benefits to the members. The trust might hold the shares in perpetuity or\ndistribute them to individual employees, or a combination of the two. The trust also\ncan buy shares back from employees particularly those who want to sell on their\nretirement. For example, a legal arrangement can be reached whereby an asset is\ndeposited into an escrow account under the trust of a neutral third party (escrow\nagent) pending satisfaction of contractual contingencies or conditions, and who, in\nturn, will deliver the asset to the party as prescribed by the contract. Placing shares\ninto an employee trust can have tax advantages and also provides an effective way of\nraising bank finance to acquire the shares (financing an employee buyout).\nWith both the direct and indirect models, there exist a plethora of variations. On the\none hand, employees acquire only a small minority stake. On the other, a large\nproportion of company share possibly even the entire share capital, is owned by the\n6employees. As far as employee-owned enterprises (EOE) are concerned, they often\nadopt profit sharing schemes, where the profits of the enterprise are shared with the\nemployees. To safeguard such arrangements, boards of directors are constituted,\nelected directly by the employees.\nThe Co-operative: A corporation owned entirely by its employees (co-operative, co-\nownership, partnership) will not have its shares traded publicly on stock markets. Co-\noperatives, or co-ops, emerged in response to economic and social inadequacies and\nrepresent a legal entity owned and democratically controlled by its members. The\nInternational Co-operative Alliance's Statement on the Co-operative Identity defines a\nco-operative as \u2018an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their\ncommon economic, social and cultural needs, and aspirations, through a jointly-\nowned and democratically-controlled enterprise\u2019 (Zeuli and Cropp, 2004). Co-\noperatives are businesses owned and controlled by the people who use its services or\nwho work in the business.\nThe Fenwick Weavers Society has been posited as being the first co-operative. It was\nfounded in 1761 to promote and maintain high standards in the craft of weaving, but\nsoon became involved in the bulk purchase of oatmeal for re-sale to its members\n(Monklands, 2008). Shortly after, Rochdale\u2019s mill workers set up the Rochdale\nEquitable Pioneers Society whose underlying purpose was that of member self-help.\nTheir co-operative existed for the benefit of its members and the improvement of their\nsocial and household condition (Monklands, 2008). They also worked out their aims\nand purposes, and committed them to paper in 1844 in the form of nine specific rules,\nthe Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. The nine rules were: open membership;\n7democratic control; distributing profits to members in proportion to their spending;\npaying small amounts of interest on capital; political and religious neutrality; cash\ntrading; no credit; promotion of education; and quality goods and services, including\ndistributing a share of profits according to purchases (Monklands, 2008).\nRecognising the considerable variance of employee ownership schemes, this paper\nexamines the nature of different forms of employee ownership and whether an\nadditional level of difference exists according to regional or country idiosyncrasies. A\nsharp distinction is made between employee ownership and the mainstream, minority\nemployee share plans in large enterprises. This paper also highlights the fact that\nfuture research needs to distinguish between the various forms of employee share\nownership if the impact of share ownership is to be more precisely understood and\ncalibrated.\nA \u2019global\u2019 Audit of ESOPs\nThe United States: In the U.S., an ESOP is a retirement plan in which the company\ncontributes its stock for the benefit of the company\u2019s employees (SEC, 2008). U.S.\nbased ESOP employees never buy or hold stock directly (SEC, 2008). As such, an\nESOP is different from other non-retirement plans such as employee stock options\nplans which give the employee the right to buy their company\u2019s stock at a set price\nwithin a certain period of time (SEC, 2008). Employee ownership in the U.S. takes\nfour broad forms and a number of combinations (NCEO, 2008c).\n\uf0b7 ESOPs, stock bonus plans and profit sharing plans primarily invested in employer\nstock;\n8\uf0b7 401(k) plans primarily invested in employer stock;\n\uf0b7 broad-based stock option plans; and\n\uf0b7 stock-purchase plans.\nESOPs are the most popular employee-ownership scheme in the U.S according to the\nNCEO (2008c). Approximately 70 per cent of ESOP owners are employed in large,\npublic companies (Rousseau and Shperling, 2004). In 2007, there were 9,774 ESOPs,\nspread across 11.2 millions employee owners in over 11,000 companies, holding 630\nbillion Euros in assets (Rosen, 2008; NCEO, 2008a). The NCEO (2008b) definition\nof ESOPs is broad and includes plans filed as ESOPs, stock-bonus plans and profit-\nsharing plans primarily invested in company stock (Rosen, 2008). Whilst profit-\nsharing and stock-bonus plans are not technically ESOPs, they are included because\nthere are functionally few differences, especially for the participants (Rosen, 2008).\nOther employee-ownership schemes, additional to ESOPs, have some 25 million\nemployee owners, holding more than 1,000 billion Euros in assets (NCEO, 2008a).\nOverall, in the U.S., the broad-based stock options (grants given to at least half of a\nfirm's workforce) have been increasing steadily, from 17 per cent in 1993 to 39 per\ncent in 1999 (Rousseau and Shperling, 2004).\nThe United Kingdom: In the UK, employee-ownership associations (EOAs)\ncomprise of employee-owned and trust-owned businesses. These EOAs came about\npredominately in two ways. One stream of EOAs is composed of management and\nemployees who benefitted from the buy-outs of public-sector firms undergoing\nprivatization (most in the late 1980s and early 1990s). These were predominately\nhighly-unionized firms, pursuing highly-leveraged buy-outs with loans from central or\n9local government bodies (Pendleton, 2001). The second stream of EOAs arose from\nemployee-ownership conversion from the private sector where owners wanted to\ndivest themselves of, or exit from the business. Many of these were owner-managed\nfirms. Typical motivation for conversion were, and are the protection of the firm from\ntake-over and paternalistic sentiment concerning the welfare of employees (Pendleton,\n2001). According to the EOA (2008), employee ownership is about the majority in the\ncompany owning part of it, whether via a trust or shares, and where no outside interest\nhas a controlling stake.\nEurope: Shared ownership plans in Europe are considerably diverse due to historical\nand institutional arrangements paralleled by a huge diversity in tax treatment. Across\nContinental Europe, studies of employee ownership report mixed results in terms of\nemployee motivation and employee and company performance (D' Art and Turner,\n2004; EFESO\u2019 2005; Pourceau, 2003; Poutsma and de Nijs, 2003). Employee\nfinancial participation in Europe has been more influenced by profit sharing, with\ngovernment and trade unions in support of such an arrangement (D' Art and Turner,\n2004; Poutsma and de Nijs, 2003). In contrast to the UK, where there has been a trend\nto introduce ESOPs in unionized enterprises (Gregg and Machin, 1988; Pendleton,\n1997), in the European Union (EU), union representation and employee share\nownership co-exist and the two appear to function largely independently of each other\n(Pendleton, 2005). Union involvement in the design, implementation and operation of\nemployee share plans in most cases is minimal. Additionally, the trend for\nprivatization of state-owned companies has contributed to wider employee ownership.\nIn Ireland, for example, nearly half a million employees were recorded as being\ncovered by \u2019profit-sharing\u2019 schemes between 1983 and 2003 (D' Art and Turner,\n2005).\n10\nIn contrast, in the early 1980s, both Scandinavia and the EU generally appeared to\nfavour schemes of collective, capital formation in preference to schemes of financial\nparticipation based at the level of the individual firm (European Trade Union Institute,\n1983; LO, 1980; Meidner, 1978). However, since 1987, with the development of\nsocial partnership between EU governments and employers, this position has largely\nbeen abandoned in favour of firm-level profit sharing or employee share-holding\nschemes (D' Art and Turner, 2000; 2005). EU leaders seem uncertain as to their role\nin employee-owned enterprises (Long, 1978). Although unions have a role in\nconceptualizing and\/or initiating the \u201cideal type\u201d of employee ownership, (Freund,\n1972), once ideas become a reality the union\u2019s role tends to be superseded. The reason\nis conflict of interests between labour and capital and the need for the unions to\nmaintain their traditional role (Long, 1978). In numerous instances where unionized\ncompanies have converted to employee ownership, companies have remained\nunionized (Long, 1978).\nIn Germany, 73 per cent of companies call for greater employee share ownership\nwhilst in Spain, legislation in support of employee-owned companies (sociedades\nlaborales) is being prepared (EFESO, 2008). France, on the other hand, exhibits\ncontradictions as the government plans to develop employee financial participation\nmore in SMEs. The President has so far displayed an interest in unblocking employee\nsavings to boost private consumption and investment in the more medium sized\nFrench business organization. In contrast, \u2019The Movement of French Enterprises\u2019\n(MEDEF) organized a \u2018Tour de France\u2019 to more broadly promote employee share\nownership (EFESO, 2008). For example, France Telecom, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Essilor\nand Saint-Gobain have all adopted ESOPs (EFESO, 2008). Overall and similar to\n11\nGermany, French law makes provision for employees of large, publicly-listed\ncompanies to elect two types of directors to represent employees. Partially privatized\ncompanies must reserve two or three seats, depending on board size, for directors\nelected by employees by right of employment. Additionally, employee-shareholders\nin any public company have the right to elect one director whenever they hold at least\n3 per cent of outstanding shares. Ginglinger et al (2010) found that employee\nrepresentation on corporate boards in France seems to be at least value-neutral, with\nsome evidence supporting an actual increase in firm valuation and profitability when\nemployee-shareholders elect company directors. However, when the firm\u2019s\nemployees are represented by radical, left-wing unions, the financial payout is\nsignificantly reduced, whilst ironically corporate valuation is unaffected and firm\nprofitability is significantly increased due to a more structured corporate governance\nregime and demanding climate of industrial relations (Ginglinger et al 2010). In Italy\nemployee-share ownership still seems to be absent from political debates. In\ncomparison to many other European countries, Italy seems to be becoming\nmarginalized in this area (EFESO, 2008).\nOverall, some 2,500 of the largest European companies now have 8.2 million\nemployee owners across Europe, holding 260 billion Euros in value (EFESO, 2008).\nJapan: Japanese employee share ownership plans (4.4 per cent of all firms in Japan in\n1960 to 95.9 per cent in 1992) differ from their U.S. and UK counterparts (Kato and\nMorishima, 2002). For a start, there are no tax incentives to employee share\nparticipation for Japanese corporations. However, employees are encouraged to\n12\nparticipate in share ownership plans by the company matching the employee\u2019s\ncontribution and bearing the administrative cost. Executives are often ineligible for\nmembership. Shares are held in a trust, though each participant has the right to\nwithdraw their shares which then become privately owned and cannot be re-entered\ninto the fund.\nRetired workers are required to exit completely. Further all employees leaving the\nplan must sell their shares to the trust at current market value. The trust is required to\nappoint a general director, who is a participant in the plan (but not an executive of the\nfirm) and who is chosen democratically by participants in the plan on a one-\nparticipant, one-vote, basis. These trusts act as a collective voice for the employee\nowners, ensuring that their views are incorporated at all levels of company\nmanagement. These trusts, or employee shareholder associations, have the capacity to\nrepresent employees\u2019 opinions as a whole and, thus have become a powerful voice.\nSpread of Practice\nAs can be seen substantial differences exist between countries in the structure and\nnature of owner\/representative participation. The three leaders in the EU, with\nemployee coverage averaging over 50 per cent, are the UK, France and Poland\n(Lowitzsch et al, 2008). Certain countries have decentralized systems of indirect\nparticipation whilst others have centralized arrangements, and still others have a\ncombination of the two. In the UK, it appears that share ownership tends to be found\nin unionized establishments through mainly single-channelled representation where\nall or the most representation occurs through the union and comparable bargaining\n13\nchannels (Gregg and Machin, 1988; Pendleton, 1997). Other countries, such as\nGermany, have dual systems, one through union representation in terms of collective\nbargaining and a further separate representation through works councils. In many\ninstances, union representation and employee share ownership co-exist and function\nlargely independently of each other, with little union involvement in the design,\nimplementation and operation of employee share plans (Pendleton, 2005; 2006). The\nexception to this is majority, employee-owned firms where unions are involved in\nmounting buy-outs (Pendleton, 2006).\nESOPs Contextualized\nAs has been argued, ESOPs are contingent on each country\u2019s laws and regulations and\nphilosophic predisposition. The increased usage of ESOPs in neo-liberal economies\nhas arisen primarily due to \u2018managerial incentivization\u2019 and favourable tax treatment\nin the hands of both the issuer and the recipients (Matsunaga, 1995). After the mid-\n1970s, U.S. legislation which encouraged ESOPs saw the number of ESOP companies\nin the U.S. dramatically increase (Conte and Lawrence, 1992), reaching peaks in 1993\nand 2005 - due to affordable tax and accounting practices. In the late 1980s, many\npublic companies set up ESOPs but when, accounting rules changed in a way that was\nless favourable for ESOPs, many companies closed down their ESOPs and moved\ntheir contributions of stock to 401(k) plans.\nDespite the praises sung about share redistribution\/participation, serious concerns\nhave also been voiced (Odoi, 2007). The favourable accounting and tax treatment that\nfacilitated the rise of ESOPs has often resulted in inflated corporate earnings, raising\nthe legitimate concern that many firms adopted broad-based stock option schemes to\nprovide an artificial boost to earnings rather than for sound business reasons\n14\n(Kroumova and Sesil, 2005). The corporate frauds and scandals, beginning with\nEnron in 2001 highlighted incidents of extraordinary executive pay and stock option\nexercises, whilst employees suffered losses in their 401(k) plan. These scandals\ninvoked new regulations and legislation, notably that of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.\nMoreover, starting from June 2005, U.S. firms have been subject to reporting stock\noptions as an expense on their balance sheets (NCEO, 2005a). In March 2005, the IRS\nissued a correction to the accounting regulations of 2004, thus curbing further\ncorporate abuse of employee incentive schemes, including ESOPs (SEC, 2008). In\nanticipation of such requirement, firms started granting options to fewer employees\n(NCEO, 2005b). Thus, since 2005, US firms are required to measure the \u2018fair value\u2019\nof options and other equity awards at the time of the grant and then expense the value\nof the award. A similar trend in the UK has paralleled the US experience, whereby the\nLabour government, in 2003, scrapped tax relief on company contributions to\nemployee benefit trusts with the intent of minimizing tax avoidance but as a result\nhave made it more difficult for companies to be trust-owned (Odoi, 2007).\nAs can be seen, individual country laws influence whether or not employees are\nallocated control rights in the companies for which they work, whether they own\nshares in it or not. As highlighted in Germany, France and Japan, the law mandates\nthat workers be represented on corporate boards. The German co-determination policy\nbegan in 1951 for mining, coal and steel companies, and was extended in 1976 to all\nfirms with more than 2000 workers. The policy requires substantial worker\nrepresentation, reserving between one-third and one-half of board seats on the\nsupervisory board (Aufsichgrat) of publicly listed companies for that purpose (Fauver\nand Fuerst, 2006). A later law required that workers receive one-third of supervisory\n15\nboard seats in companies with between 500 and 2000 workers (Fauver and Fuerst,\n2006).\nRecognising the notable difference between countries holding a stakeholder\nphilosophy such as Germany, against those with a shareholder philosophy such as the\nU.S.A, certain scholars still argue that employee participation in firm governance can\nbe value-enhancing, particularly when companies are confronted with economic or\nfinancial distress (Acharya et al, 2008; Galai and Weiner, 2008). Allen et al (2007)\nand Claessens and Ueda (2008) support this view presenting empirical evidence that\nstakeholder-oriented firms often prosper when competing against purely shareholder-\noriented firms. In fact, Allen et al (2007) predict that firms in stakeholder-oriented\nsocieties, such as Germany and Japan where a close relationship exists between the\nenterprise and the banking system, will be more able to reduce the probability of firm\nbankruptcy despite the use of debt.\nImperatives for Employee Ownership\nDifferent reasons drive a firm's decision to adopt an employee- ownership model. The\nobjectives of profit sharing tend to vary according to the desire of particular\ninitiator(s) (D' Art and Turner, 2004). Social harmonizers, recognising the altruistic\nproponents of these schemes, see them as a way to realize equity and social justice (D'\nArt and Turner, 2004). Couper (2006) has argued that the underlying values of self-\nhelp, equity, equality, democracy and solidarity are values required for finding a\ncommon voice and sense of responsibility. It is contended that there is a \u2018direct\nparallel with the employees' need to feel responsibility (self-help), belonging\n(community), involvement (democracy) and reward (equity) and the sustainable long-\nterm direction for the business, drawing on genuine employee engagement (Couper,\n16\n2006: 7). In the wholly employee-owned firms, \u2018the great strength of the partnership's\nmodel is that employees have a real stake in the business [...] co-ownership allows the\npartnership to take a long-term view, because we do not have to answer to external\nshareholders who are usually seeking quick returns\u2019 (Killen, quoted in Odoi, 2007: 1).\nManagerial proponents have contended that employee ownership schemes enhance\norganizational outcomes such as productivity and profitability (D' Art and Turner,\n2004). Long (1978: 755) stated that ESOP\u2019s will put each worker in the position of\nimproving \u2018his own efforts towards costs minimization\u2019, thus enhancing the value of\nthe enterprise and in turn, eliminating strikes, slowdowns, antiquated work rules and\nunreasonable wage-demands. Thus, the imperative proposed is that profit sharing and\nshare ownership schemes represent an attempt to link pay with the performance of the\nfirm as a whole, with the aim of engendering a commonality of interest. Even from\nan agency theory perspective, scholars have argued that agency costs can be reduced\nby aligning executive, managerial and employee compensation to firm performance\n(DeFusco et al., 1990; Jensen and Meckling, 1976). This is the case where\nparticularly \u2019difficult to monitor\u2019 inputs from human capital will more likely adopt\ncompensation plans that provide inexpensive substitutes for more formal monitoring,\nsuch as hiring more managers or supervisors (DeFusco et al, 1990; Jensen and\nMeckling, 1976). The hypothesis put forward by scholars is that employee monitoring\nis likely to be more severe in knowledge-based firms especially ones that are large\nand where intellectual capital is the main source of customer value, or in firms that are\nexperiencing rapid growth (De Fusco et al, 1990).\n17\nSimilarly Rousseau and Shperling\u2019s (2004: 563) put forward the perspective that\n\u2018ownership is increasingly part of a larger set of practices for firms where a highly-\ncommitted workforce is viewed as a competitive advantage\u2019. In similar vein, Rosen et\nal (2005a; 2005b) state that when employees own a stake in the company, their\nattitude also sharpens as does the company\u2019s bottom line. Morris et al (2006: 328)\nfound that in the UK the most common reason for employee ownership is \u2018to make\nemployees feel that they are a part of the company and to create a feeling of\ninvolvement and interest in the company's fortune\u2019. The SEC (2008) suggests that\nmany companies use stock plans to compensate, retain and attract employees. Thus,\nbroad-based ownership arrangements may reflect employer efforts to retain and\nmotivate a collective of value-creating labour. For example, broad-based stock\noptions are more common where monitoring costs are high, such as where intellectual\ncapital drives value creation (Kroumova and Sesil, 2005).\nHowever, and in contrast, firms may adopt broad-based options not to promote\nalignment, but rather because their expensing treatment makes them appear to be an\ninexpensive means of delivering compensation. This, in turn, suggests some\ncompanies adopt ESOPs for the wrong reason(s) and this may also mean that firms\nthat could benefit from their use may be abandoning them unnecessarily.\nOverall, the neo-liberal proponents of financial participation expect a diffusion of\nshare ownership to establish people's capitalism (D' Art and Turner, 2004; Kelso and\nHetter, 1967; Saunders and Harris, 1994)). Arguing from the unitary perspective,\nsome have proposed that there is a convergence of the roles of owner, manager and\nworker, particularly in knowledge-intensive firms where expanded worker\n18\nparticipation in ownership and related privileges include access to financial\ninformation and greater freedom in decision making (Rousseau and Shperling, 2004;\nZardkoohi and Paetzold, 2004)\nAs share schemes have been principally used for social equity and employee\nmotivation reasons, they have equally been used as anti trade union measures.\nManagement of non-union firms, particularly in the US, use financial participation as\npart of a unitarist strategy to exclude trade unions. Profit sharing, or employee share-\nholding, is used as a defence or deterrent against union-organizing drives (Czarnecki,\n1970; 2005; D' Art and Turner, 2004; McHugh et al, 1999). The reason for the\nadoption of employee ownership is the historical shift from the centrality of rigidly\ndirecting Taylorist \u2019hired hands\u2019 (Kouzmin, 1980) to the subtlety of influencing the\nthinking, values and self-managing norms and \u2019identities\u2019 of \u2019hired heads\u2019. Bridging\nthe paradigmatic Taylorist\/Fordist \u2018thinking versus doing\u2019 breach remains an over-\narching legacy in Anglo-American managerial praxis, consolidated further in Neo-\nliberalism (Kouzmin, 2009). The subtle re-branding of labour or employees into\n\u2019worker-owners\u2019 or \u2018employee-owners,\u2019 further advances the institutionalization of\nthe \u2019worker-owner\u2019 identity within the neo-liberal ideology (Kouzmin, 1980).\nEmployee Ownership Value\nWhatever the reasoning for adopting shareholding participation, a growing body of\nempirical evidence suggests that there is a weak, but positive relationship between the\nbroad dispersion of ESOPs and superior firm performance outcomes such as\nemployee productivity, firm profitability and stock performance (Klein, 1987). Blasi\n19\net al (2003:176), for example, have argued that a company cannot achieve desired\nmotivation and participation effects without financial participation, as,\n\u201ctelling employees to take ownership of their jobs rings hollow if\nmanagement doesn\u2019t offer actual financial ownership or some share in the\nimproved performance [\u2026]. Without wealth sharing, in some form, it feels\nlike the company is just trying to con you into working harder.\u201d\nBased on the assumption that owners do not need to be motivated, one stream of the\nliterature submits that ownership of itself creates the motivation for continuous\nperformance improvement (Blasi et al, 2003). An agency-theory-informed stream of\nliterature highlights the possible economic rewards as root causes of the beneficial\nmotivational effect (BCI Group, 2002; Hallock and Salazar, 2003; Ittner et al, 2002;\nSesil et al, 2002). Others argue that if an ESOP is combined with some of the basic\nrights of ownership, such as information about the company and participation in\ndecision-making, that of itself will also have a positive impact on work attitude and\nbehaviour (Gudmundson et al, 2003; Rosen and Carberry, 2002; Stack and\nBurlingham, 2002). Thus, there appears to be a performance premium associated with\nsharing stock options with the broader set of employees, especially in \u2019knowledge\u2019\nintensive firms where better company performance is associated with the use of\nemployee ownership (Pendleton, 2001; Sesil et al, 2003). Pendleton (2001) supports\nthis case purporting that ESOP participation is more widespread within the financial\nsector due to employees higher knowledge of the characteristics of the plans and more\ngenerally in sectors with a higher concentration of non-manual employees who may be\nmore familiar with the use and concept of stock savings.\n20\nSome (Bonin et al, 1993; Craig and Penavel, 1992; Park et al, 2004) have argued that,\nwhile employee ownership is associated with higher productivity, the greater survival\nrate of these companies is not explained by greater employment stability, but rather by\nhigher productivity, financial strength or compensation flexibility. Bonin et al (1993)\nhave argued that the switch from focusing on profit maximizing to other optimizing\ncriteria ensures workers-owners\u2019 interest in the firm's decision-making process and in\ntheir sharing of the surplus benefits. Thus, employee ownership companies may\nprovide greater employment security in an effort to build a more co-operative culture,\nwhich can increase employee commitment, training and willingness to make\nadjustments when economic difficulties occur (Melgarejo et al, 2007; Park et al,\n2004). It should be noted however, that the majority of the empirical studies\nexamining ESOPs are carried out within the U.S. shareholder value market (Blasi et\nal, 2003), with only a few notable studies carried out in the European Union (EU)\n(Pendleton , 2001).\nOverall, employee share plans or \u2018partnership capitalism\u2019 is found to increase the\nproductivity level by about 4 per centage points, compared to firms that do not adopt\nsuch practice (Blasi et al, 2002). Total shareholder returns increase by about two per\ncentage points relative to other firms, whilst profit levels go up by about 14 per cent\n(Blasi et al, 2002). Although certain studies have produced inconclusive results,\noverall research results have shown that employee ownership has a modest positive\nimpact on workplace variables (Blasi et al., 1996; Huselid, 1995; Klein, 1987;\nPendleton et al, 1998; Pfeffer, 1995; ). Certainly one consistent theme has been the\nemphasis on good human resource practice and the impact of that on firm\n21\nperformance and competitive advantage (Huselid, 1995; Morris et al, 2006; Pfeffer,\n1995).\nWhat we Know (or do not Know) about ESOPs\nAs shown attention has focused on exploring the relationship between profit sharing\nand organizational performance, controlling for possible exogenous and endogenous\neffects including firm size, market location, product portfoliom, date of establishment\nand individual country effects (D' Art and Turner, 2004). Firm performance has been\nmeasured and compared through such components as pre-adoption and post\u2013adoption\nof ESOPs, as well as between ESOP and non-ESOP firms. In addition to financial\nperformance, profit sharing impact on the level of productivity, service quality,\nproduct to market time and rate of innovation, have also been examined (D' Art and\nTurner, 2004). Various types of employee ownership in Britain, Ireland, Japan,\nScandinavia, Spain and the former Eastern bloc have also been studied (D\u2019 Art and\nTurner, 2004; Jones and Kato, 1995; Melgarejo et al, 2007; Morris et al, 2006;\nPendleton et al, 1998; Pendleton, 2001; Poole, 1988). Further, the presence or the\nabsence of staff associations (unions) and the impact of that on share ownership\nadoption have also equally been given attention (Morris et al, 2006; Poole, 1989).\nSome scholars (Gudmundson et al, 2003; Rosen and Carberry, 2002; Stack and\nBurlingham, 2002) have found a link between employee share ownership, financial\nparticipation and involvement in decision making, resulting a \u2018culture of ownership\u2019,\non the one hand, and innovation on the other, due to \u2018initiation and implementation of\ninnovation being significantly enhanced when employees are empowered to take\naction\u2019 (Gudmundson et al, 2003: 14). Certain scholars contend that firms with\n22\nemployee share ownership are able to tap into human capital by operating \u2018policies\nthat draw more fully on worker skills and innovation\u2019 (Kruse et al, 2003: 6).\nResearch has also shown that companies with employee share ownership (50 per cent\nor more), or with significant levels of employee financial participation, have higher\nproductivity and financial performance, greater innovation, higher levels of customer\nloyalty, lower staff turnover, increased shareholder returns, productivity and financial\nperformance (Conyon and Freeman, 2001; Freeman et al, 2004; Kato and Morishima,\n2002; Lamberg et al, 1993; Michie et al, 2002).\nAn overall literature review (Conte and Svejnar, 1990; Doucouliagos, 1995; Kruse\nand Blasi, 1997; Kruse et al, 2007; P\u00e9rotin and Robinson, 2003), suggests that\nemployee share ownership has limited but positive effects on organizational\nperformance and particular productivity, albeit these outcomes are often small and\/or\nstatistically insignificant. Studies based on western-market economies suggest that\nemployee share-ownership and profit-sharing have had positive effects on workers\nincentives and productivity (Blinder, 1990). In similar vein, studies from new EU\nentrants, such as the Baltic countries, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia, indicate that\npost-privatization performance of employee-owned firms have been similar to that of\nother types of firms (Uvali\u0107 and Vaughan-Whitehead, 1997). The Doucouliagos\n(1995) study suggests that the positive effects tend to be more prominent and\nstatistically significant amongst firms with majority employee ownership rather than\namongst firms with employee share plans, (Conte and Svejnar, 1990). Although most\nshare-ownership plans do not appear to fundamentally transform the employment\nrelationship, evidence has emerged which highlights the minimizing of the \u2018free-rider\u2019\n23\nsyndrome and the redirection of alignment concerns common to large and listed\nenterprises (Sengupta, 2008).\nOne theme runs through many of the studies and that is the lack of transformation of\nthe firm through employee relationship and that may be due to the fact that in the\nmajority of cases \u2018shareholders do not own the corporation, which is an autonomous\nlegal person\u2019 (Heracleous and Lan, 2010: 24). Thus, when company \u2018directors go\nagainst shareholder wishes, even when a loss in value is documented, courts tend to\nside with directors the vast majority of the time\u2019 and, as such, render shareholders\nimpotent (Heracleous and Lan, 2010: 24). Although share-ownership schemes transfer\nequity to employees, in many cases this is proportionally small and so little\nexpectation is created on the part of those employees involved in transforming the\nway the company is run. However, in companies with a substantial employee\nownership (50 per cent or more), employee expectations have been captured as\ndifferent (Pendleton et al, 1998). Some have argued that the effects of employee\nownership are greater or are achieved only when there is employee participation in\ndecision-making (Pendleton et al. 1998; Addison and Belfield, 2001). In employee-\nowned firms, employee participation appears requisite for achieving a full sense of\nownership; namely the right to determine how an asset is used and disposed off\n(Pendleton et al. 1998; Addison and Belfield, 2001; Rosen et al, 2005; Kaarsemaker\nand Poutsma, 2006).\nYet, despite findings for and against, the majority of studies of ESOPs favourably\nconclude that the advantages of employee involvement and\/or ownership of the\nenterprise outweigh the disadvantages. However, the voice of concern (Kaarsemaker\n24\nand Poutsma, 2006) relates to the simplicity of the studies and inadequacy of research\nmethodology. Kaarsemaker, and Poutsma (2006) especially highlight to,\n\uf0b7 an inadequate probing of the conditions supporting positive employee ownership\noutcomes. Are identified positive effects due to ownership structure or other\nfactors such as leadership?\n\uf0b7 an inadequate study of the experiences\/concerns of the individual in terms of\nhappiness, stress, adequacy of earnings or sufficiency of pensions;\n\uf0b7 an inadequate scrutiny of the relationship between improved productivity and\nindividual well being, despite the volume of conclusions linking positive\noutcomes for the company and the employee; and\n\uf0b7 an undue focus on EO enterprises in Anglo-Saxon nations rather than broader\ninternational comparisons especially where financial participation is supported by\ntask incentives such as in Austrian, Germany, Ireland, France, etc.\nCertainly studies of multi-national corporations (MNC\u2019s), strongly suggests that the\npositive outcomes attributed to ESOPs enterprises could be more the result of\n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2008),\n\uf0b7 capable leadership;\n\uf0b7 well-trained and developed management, both strategically and operationally\ncapable despite pressures for meeting short-term targets;\n\uf0b7 well-thought through human resource management (HRM) policies promoting\ntalent management, collaborative\/team ways of working, work\/life balance,\ncoaching and counselling;\n\uf0b7 responsible and disciplined governance; and\n25\n\uf0b7 a positive orientation to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability\nadoption.\nWhere to for ESOPS?\nThe assumptions underlying employee ownership research point to the fact that\nemployee ownership modifies the relationship between workers and their work\norganization which, in turn, has implications for the quality of working life of\nemployees, for their performance and the performance of the organisation\n(Tannenbaum, 1983). Some argue that such effects occur through companies designed\nto be more egalitarian, participative and supportive, appealing to a sense of\nidentification with, and contributing to, the success of the enterprise (Tannenbaum,\n1983). However, other studies have shown modest outcomes of worker participation\nas they had relatively little influence compared with that of the enterprise managers\n(Obardovic, 1970). Workers who were members of the councils were only slightly\nmore satisfied with their jobs than workers who were not council members\n(Obradovic, 1970).\nOn a broader scale, one powerful call is for employee ownership studies to be pursued\non a cross-cultural basis. A number of researchers (Blasi, 1988; Hallock and Salazar,\n2003; Klein and Hall, 1988) propose that future research should avoid the\nmanipulation of large, readily-available data sets which have dominated previous\nstudies and should concentrate more on detailed studies of individual firms that have\nadopted ESOPs. Some critics (Odoi, 2007) argue that although there is a range of\nemployee-ownership business models, there is an overall unawareness, not only\namongst employees but also amongst accountants and lawyers, about how these\n26\nmodels work and how co-owned schemes have been or are structured (Kouzmin,\n1993).\nThe alternative voice is that the study of employee-ownership models is hampered not\nso much by empirical concerns as much as by paradigmatic and ideological\nconstraints, especially in relation to the on-going presence of managerial prerogatives\nand increasing disparities in remuneration in Neo-liberal economies (Kakabadse, et al\n2004). Then there is the question of 20th Century European history. Commissar,\nentrepreneur, manager and bureaucrat constitute one social cleavage. They cohere and\narticulate similar interests by virtue of the common problems and experiences to\nwhich their position exposes them: the logic of authority relations within formal\norganizations (Kouzmin, 1980). One has yet to see a \u2018distributive,\u2019 rather than a\n\u2018production,\u2019 socialism (Kouzmin and Korac-Kakabadse, 1997), the latter having led\nto a universal embrace of a highly-exploitative, technical division of labour.\nWithin the grip of \u2018means\u2019 over \u2018ends\u2019, Eastern Europe did struggle to find some\nexpression of labour concerns within \u2018Fordist\u2019 industrialism. Despite the challenges,\nhow can one seriously engage with the question of employee ownership whilst\nignoring such rich veins of experience from Eastern Europe? Even the Chinese have\nentered into the fray (li et al, 2005).\nThe case for cross-cultural, bottom up research is simply overwhelming. Moreover,\nthere is a need for better understanding how employee-ownership firms perform in\nrelation to the non-employee ownership firms in a globally-depressed market, and,\nmore importantly, whether employee-ownership schemes will continue to survive in a\n27\nconstantly changing labor market? Moreover, the literature is predominately silent on\nwhether:\n\uf0b7 shareholding structure, of itself, determines higher-quality performance at the\ncompany, team and individual level or not;\n\uf0b7 quality management, supportive organization culture and a positive orientation\ntowards CSR and sustainability result as much from capable leadership and\nforward thinking HRM policies and practices, rather than just financial and legal\nstructures,\n\uf0b7 security of employment, particularly under global financial crisis conditions, may\nor may not have the beneficial effects discussed above,\n\uf0b7 the tension between employees and management, and between parts of the\norganization is a phenomenon of most medium to large-sized organizations,\nirrespective of ownership structure. The leadership capability of top management\nto minimize misalignment effects on company performance emerges as a critical\nfactor, possibly less so than ownership structures.\nCertainly future study of the effects and benefits of employee participation\/employee\nownership schemes can no longer remain within the paradigm of, is it good to have or\nnot? The need is to examine ESOP schemes as one alternative available to the firm in\ntheir quest for performance improvement within a context of rapidly changing\neconomic conditions.\n28\nReferences\nAcharya, V.
