By adjusting their ratios a wide range of optical,\ntribological, and electronic properties are possible.1\u20133 Early\ncalculations by Robertson and O\u2019Reilly4 showed that the op-\ntical properties of a-C and a-C:H are ruled by the size of the\nsp2 clusters, which can either be in the form of aromatic\nrings or olefinic chains. These clusters may introduce states\nat or near the Fermi level, depending on their size and on\nwhether they are odd or even numbered.5 Hopping between\nclusters has been proposed6 as a possible mechanism for\nroom-temperature conduction. Recent calculations7 showed\nthat the sp2 states remain localized even up to 80% sp2\nbonding, well above the percolation threshold. This localiza-\ntion of states has been attributed to dihedral bond angle dis-\norder, and such localized states result in hopping with a low\nactivation energy at room and low temperatures, and band-\ntail conduction at higher temperatures.8,9\nConventional techniques to alter the sp2 content for\na-C:H films are by varying the deposition parameters such\nas dc self-bias,10 through the addition of N11 or through ther-\nmal annealing.12 Conventional annealing results in a macro-\nscopic sp2 restructuring of the film, and the formation of\nlarger and larger sp2 clusters. An alternative approach is to\nperform localized heating by means of ion implantation,\nwhereby it is possible to deposit highly localized energy in a\ncontrolled manner. Previous studies of damage as a result of\nion implantation found extensive sp2 restructuring ~graphiti-\nzation! at very high doses,13,14 and a consequent increase in\nfilm conductivity. However, by controlling the ion dose we\nshow that it is possible to enhance the conductivity through\nthe film, but prevent macroscopic graphitization. This results\nin an effective delocalization of electrons within the film.\nFilms were grown on Si and Corning 7059 substrates on\nthe water-cooled earthed electrode of a rf plasma-enhanced\nchemical-vapor deposition system described elsewhere.15\nFilms were implanted with B ions at energies of 20 and 26\nkeV in the dose range of 231012\u2013 231016 cm22, and were\nsimulated using SUSPRE v1.4 assuming a H:C ratio of 1:1 and\na film density of 1.72 g cm23. The projected ranges were0163-1829\/2001\/63~12!\/121201~4!\/$15.00 63 1212found to be 60 and 76 nm for the two implant energies, with\na straggle of 13 nm in each case. Electrical measurements\nwere made on Au\/a-C:H\/Cr device structures. Room-\ntemperature electron paramagnetic resonance measurements\nwere made using a TM011 mode cavity at about 9.9 GHz, and\na field modulation of 100 kHz. Spin concentrations were\ndetermined by comparison with a Varian standard sample of\npitch in KCl; g values were determined by comparing the\nline position to that of the resonance from the F1 center in\nMgO. Relaxation times were measured using the power satu-\nration method discussed elsewhere.16\nThe variation in optical band gap and resistivity of the\na-C:H films is shown in Fig. 1. On increasing the dose to\n231014 cm22, the Tauc gap remains approximately constant\nFIG. 1. Variation in the ~a!

By contrast, for doses greater than 2\n31014 cm22, the optical gap falls and eventually reaches 0.2\neV at the highest ion dose, with the film resistivity decreas-\ning from 631012 to 53106 V cm\u2014a decrease by nearly six\norders of magnitude. The H content falls from 55 to 25 at. %\nover the dose range, as measured using elastic recoil detec-\ntion analysis.\nElectron paramagnetic resonance ~EPR! measurements\nwere made on all implanted films; however, signals from\nC-related centers with g;2.0028 are only observed for films\nimplanted with doses higher than 231015 cm22. At lower\ndoses the EPR signal is dominated by signals with g\n;2.0055\u2013 2.0061, associated with Si-related defects Figure\n2~a! shows that the spin concentration increases with dose\nfrom 331017 cm23 in the unimplanted sample, up to 2.7\n31020 cm23 at the highest dose of 231016 cm22. In this\ndose range the EPR signal has a Lorentzian line shape, and\nthe peak-to-peak linewidth DBpp reduces from 0.83 to 0.13\nmT, as shown in Fig. 2~b!. The variation in the spin lattice,\nT1 , and the spin-spin, T2 , relaxation time with dose are\nshown in Fig. 2~c!. As the implantation dose is increased, T1\nshortens from 1.131025 to 631028 s, while T2 is observe\nto lengthen from 1.431028 to 5.131028 s. Using the\nmethod employed in Ref. 17, we have calculated the dipolar\n(vp) and exchange (vc) frequencies from the available val-\nues of T1 and T2 . The ratio of vc \/vp is found to be 1.9 for\nthe unimplanted sample, which increases to 4.8 for the film\nimplanted to 231015 cm22, and then rises to 16.7 and 50 for\nthe two highest doses. The ratio of vc \/vp indicates the ef-\nficiency in which the rapidly fluctuating magnetic field is\nable to average out the static dipolar broadening. Values over\n10 indicate an efficient motional narrowing, in this case as a\nresult of extensive sp2 reordering. This occurs only in the\ntwo highest doses. In the case of the 231015 cm22 sample,\nextensive sp2 reordering has not occurred at this dose, but\nmotional narrowing has increased the ratio as compared to its\nunimplanted value.\nThese results indicate that there exist two regimes; one for\ndoses up to and including 231014 cm22, where the Tauc gap\nremains constant and the film resistivity falls by about two\norders of magnitude; and another regime above this dose\nwhere, by the highest dose of 231016 cm22, there is a near\nclosure of the optical gap, a further reduction of the film\nresistivity by six orders of magnitude, and where exchange\neffects dominate the EPR linewidth and relaxation times. In\norder to analyze the resistivity variation, the equations for\nvariable-range hopping ~VRH! for electrons at the Fermi\nlevel, originally derived by Mott and Davis,18 have been ap-\nplied to these films.14 Using a localization factor a, of 7.5\n3106 cm21,19 the required density of states at the Fermi\nlevel, N(EF), would have to exceed 1029 cm23 eV21. From\nthe measured spin density of 331020 cm23 at the highest\ndose, an estimate of N(EF) can be obtained by assuming a\nmaximum correlation energy of 2 eV.20 This gives N(EF)\n;1020 cm23 eV21, considerably less than that required for\nVRH. In the model of Ref. 6, conduction at room tempera-\nture occurs via hopping between neighboring sp2 islands,12120and so is determined by the concentration of gap states and\nthe separation between the sp2 islands, as shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 3. As the sp2 content of the as-deposited films is\nlikely to be low ~30%!, the hopping distance is likely to be\nlarge, resulting in low conductivity. During ion implantation,\nlocalized heating would result in the formation of highly\nlocalized sp2 sites, which are small if the ion dose is below\nthe graphitization threshold, at which the ion tracks start to\ncoincide as in the case of diamond.21 It is likely that the\nconcentration of these introduced sites is proportional to the\nion dose. Implantation at low doses introduces nanocluster-\ning below the average cluster size, which maintains the wide\nFIG. 2.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 63 121201~R!band gap but increases the conductivity by decreasing the\nhopping distance. At higher doses, the film restructures over\nthe bulk of the film, the band gap collapses accordingly, and\nthe effects of exchange become prevalent.\nReductions in film resistivity with concomitant falls in the\noptical band gap as a function of ion dose were reported in\nta-C by McCulloch et al.,13 and in diamondlike a-C:H by\nPrawer et al.14 In the former, the reduction of the optical gap\nand the decrease in film resistivity occurred even at the low-\nest doses investigated (1013 cm22), and appeared to be con-\ncomitant. In the latter study, the resistivity remained constant\nup to a dose of 1015 cm22 and then decreased, and the optical\ngap decreased from about 1.5 eV in the as-grown film to less\nthan 1 eV (231017 cm22), following the variation in the\nresistivity. It is interesting to note that the H concentration in\nthe a-C:H films decreased from 35 at. % ~as grown! to less\nthan 3 at. % at the highest dose. So, in both cases, as the\noptical band gap falls there is a concomitant fall in resistiv-\nity.\nSince the film implanted at 231015 cm22 may exhibit evi-\ndence of exchange but still possesses a band gap of 1.3 eV,\nthis film has favorable properties which may be applicable\nfor device applications. Below a dose of 231014 cm22, the\nconduction mechanism is space charge limited,22 as inferred\nfrom the thickness scaling law (J}V2\/d3). Above a dose of\n631015 cm22, a linear ln J\/E versus E1\/2 relationship is ob-\ntained, consistent with Poole-Frenkel conduction. The film\nimplanted at a dose of 231015 cm22 shows a voltage-\ndependent current enhancement, as shown in Fig. 4, which\ndoes not follow either of the above mechanisms. We inves-\ntigated the J versus E characteristics of two films implanted\nat the same dose with film thicknesses of 80 and 104 nm. In\nthe case of the 80 nm thick film, the projected ranges derived\nfrom SUSPRE indicate that the film would be implanted\nthroughout the whole of its thickness, while the 104-nm-\nthick film is likely to have an unimplanted region close to the\nsubstrate. The former sample shows switching behavior in\nFIG. 4. Current density vs applied electric field characteristics\nfor two a-C:H films implanted to a dose of 231015ions cm22 of 80-\nand 104-nm thickness. Simulations predict that the B ions have\npenetrated all the way through the thinner film but only partially\nthrough the thicker film.12120both forward and reverse voltage directions, while the latter\nshows switching in the forward direction only, i.e., rectifica-\ntion of over one order of magnitude. We have applied a\nSchottky barrier-lowering mechanism for this film using the\nequation23\nJ5A**T2 expFqFkT 1 b2 AE G , ~1!\nwhere\nb5\n1\nkT AS e\n3\npere0\nD 1\/2, ~2!\nwhere A** is Richardson\u2019s constant, k is Boltzmann\u2019s con-\nstant, T is the absolute temperature, e is 1.6310219 C, e0 is\nthe permittivity of free space, and er is the relative permit-\ntivity. From the slope of the ln J versus E1\/2 characteristic, a\nvalue of 2.4 is obtained for er , and an approximate barrier\nheight of 0.8 eV is calculated. Since the 104-nm-thick film is\nlikely to be partially implanted and the 80-nm-thick film is\nlikely to be completely implanted, there must be a depen-\ndence on the back contact which determines whether the cur-\nrent enhancement occurs in the negative voltage region or\nnot. This can be explained if a contact which has received a\nsuitable dose of ions is able to trap charge. This trapping\nprocess, as a result of the applied voltage, would then result\nin a space-charge region close to the contact, resulting in a\nnarrowing of the electrical thickness of the film and hence a\nmodification of the barrier height at the contact on the other\nside of the film. If a film is only partially implanted, then this\ntrapping process can only occur at the surface contact. This\nwould mean that current enhancement would only occur in\nthe positive voltage segment and not the negative voltage\nsegment. In this way, a barrier-limiting process can account\nfor the conduction properties of these films. This ion-beam-\ninduced barrier is as a consequence of the controlled increase\nin the bulk conductivity or delocalization of bulk states, pre-\nviously not possible in our films.\nThe characteristics of the rectifying diode demonstrated\nhere may be compared to the Schottky diodes reported in\nRef. 24, the p-n junction diode reported in Ref. 25, and the\na-C:H and ta-C heterojunction diodes reported in Refs. 26\nand 27. In the case of the Schottky diode, point contacts were\nrequired which may have reduced the efficiency of carrier\ninjection from the top contact, and for p-n junction diode,\nthe forward to reverse rectification ratio was only about six.\nFor the a-C:H-based heterojunction diode26 the rectification\nratio was two orders of magnitude. However, before electri-\ncal measurements were performed a potential of 200 V was\napplied to the device in order to measure any current gain\nwith applied voltage, and its effects on both the film micro-\nstructure and the contacts are not known at present. No such\nvoltage was applied in the case of the ion-implanted diodes\nwhich were fabricated in this study.\nTo conclude, we have implanted hydrogenated amor-\nphous carbon films, and observed evidence of a controllable\nincrease in conductivity, as a function of ion dose. This is\nonly possible using ion implantation, as by using this method1-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nKHAN, CAREY, SILVA, JONES, AND BARKLIE PHYSICAL REVIEW B 63 121201~R!one can introduce localized heating in order to promote\nnanoclustering. The high-field conduction properties of the\nmaterial appear to show a contact-limited current at interme-\ndiate ion doses, which allows us to suggest that devices using12120the enhanced conduction properties of the material are pos-\nsible. We have demonstrated that it is possible to create\nbarrier-controlled devices in films with partially delocalized\nelectrons which still possess an appreciable band gap.*Electronic address: r.khan@eim.surrey.ac.uk\n1 C.
