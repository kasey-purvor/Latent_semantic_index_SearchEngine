To the knowledge of the\nauthors, Lx has received scarcely any attention as a supporting\nligand for binding to transition metals.6 Specifically, we focus on\nthe reactivity of 6,6\u2032\u2032-{(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3)N=CR}2-2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-C15H9N3\n(Lx = L1 R = H; Lx = L2 R = Me) towards divalent metal\nhalides of iron, nickel and zinc and pay particular attention to the\neffect of the imino-carbon substituent R on the nuclearity of the\nproduct.

L2 has also been the\nsubject of a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study.\nPale yellow crystals of L2 suitable for the X-ray determination\nwere grown by the slow evaporation of a dichloromethane solution\ncontaining the compound.A view ofL2 is shown in Fig. 2; selected\nbond distances and angles are listed in Table 1. The structure ofL2\nconsists of three 2,6-linked pyridine rings with the imino groups\noccupying the ends of the oligopyridylimine chain. The nitrogen\natoms of the pyridine groups adopt amutually transoid conforma-\ntion which is also extended to the terminal imine groups in a man-\nner reminiscent of that found in 2,6-oligopyridines.1,8 A slight twist\n[torsion angles: N(1)\u2013C(13)\u2013C(14)\u2013N(2) 1.8\u25e6; N(2)\u2013C(18)\u2013C(19)\u2013\nN(3) 6.9\u25e6; N(3)\u2013C(23)\u2013C(24)\u2013N(4) 3.4\u25e6; N(4)\u2013C(28)\u2013C(29)\u2013N(5)\n3.5\u25e6] from planarity is displayed throughout the imine-pyridine\nbackbone as has been observed for L1.5 The 2,6-diisopropyl\nsubstituents on the terminal aryl groups sit above and below the\nplanes of the nearest pyridine units within the chain. The N(1)\u2013\nC(13) andN(5)\u2013C(29) bond lengths of 1.284(6) and 1.255(6) A\u02da are\nconsistent with their being double bond character. The IR spectra\nofL1 andL2 confirm the presence of the iminewith m(C=N)bands\nat ca. 1645 cm\u22121 which is supported by the 13CNMR spectra which\nshow peaks at d 163.5 (L1) and d 166.1 (L2) corresponding to the\nimino carbon atoms.\n(b) Complexation reactions\n(i) Reaction of MX2 with L1. The reaction of L1 with one\nequivalent of MX2 [MX2 = FeCl2, (DME)NiBr2, ZnCl2] in n-\nbutanol at 110 \u25e6C gave complexes [(L1)MX2] (M = Fe, X = Cl\n1a; M = Ni, X = Br 1b; M = Zn, X = Cl 1c) in high yield\n(Scheme 2). No evidence for bimetallic products was apparent\non addition of two equivalents or greater of MX2 or after\nstirring for longer periods. All products have been characterised\nby microanalysis, FAB mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and,\nin the cases of 1a and 1b, by magnetic measurements and 1c by\n1H NMR spectroscopy (see Table 2 and Experimental section). In\naddition, crystals of 1a, 1b and 1c have been subjected to single-\ncrystal X-ray diffraction studies.\nCrystals of 1a, 1b and 1c suitable for the X-ray determinations\nwere grownby slowcoolingof hot acetonitrile solutions containing\nthe complexes. The structures of 1a, 1b and 1c are similar and only\n1a will be discussed in any detail. A view of 1a is depicted in\nFig. 3; selected bond distances and angles for 1a, 1b and 1c are\nlisted in Table 3. Themolecular structure of 1a depicts a single iron\ncentre bound by L1 and two terminal chloride ligands. The metal\ncentre occupies the tridentate terpyridine cavity with the two imine\ngroups pendant and exo to the coordinated terpyridinemoiety.The\ngeometry at the metal centre can be best described as distorted\ntrigonal bipyramidal with N(2) and N(2A) defining the axial sites\n[N(2)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013N(2A) 150.8(3)\u25e6] and N(3), Cl(1) and Cl(1A) the\nequatorial ones [N(3)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1) 120.99(5); Cl(1)\u2013Fe(1)\u2013Cl(1A)\n118.03(9)\u25e6]. The complex has molecular C2 symmetry about an\naxis containing the metal, the pyridyl\u2013N(3) and C(21) atoms.\nThe central M\u2013Npyridyl distance [2.073(6) A\u02da] is noticeably less than\nthe M\u2013N(2)pyridyl and M\u2013N(2A)pyridyl bond lengths [2.234(5) A\u02da],\nprobably as a consequence of satisfying the tridentate chelating\nconstraint of the ligand and that it occupies a equatorial site within\nthe trigonal bipyramid. The C=N bond distance [1.283(8) A\u02da] is\nsimilar to that found in L2 [av. 1.258 A\u02da].\nThe FAB mass spectra for 1a\u2013c show fragmentation peaks cor-\nresponding to the loss of one halide group from the corresponding\nmolecular ion peak. The IR spectra for 1a\u2013cdisplay m(C=N)bands\nat ca. 1635 cm\u22121 and in a similar region to that for free L1,\nsupporting the pendant nature of the imino groups. Complexes\n1a and 1b are paramagnetic and display magnetic moments of\n5.3 and 2.8 lB (Evans Balance at ambient temperature) which\nare consistent with high spin configurations possessing four and\ntwo unpaired electrons, respectively.

In addition, crystals of\n3a and 3c have been the subject of single-crystal X-ray diffraction\nstudies.\nCrystals of 3a and 3cwere grown by slow cooling of hot acetoni-\ntrile solutions of the corresponding complexes. The structures of\n3a and 3c are essentially the same and will be discussed together. A\nview of 3c is depicted in Fig. 4; selected bond distances and angles\nare listed for both 3a and 3c in Table 4. The molecular structures\nreveal bimetallic complexes in which the two metal centres are\nsupported on the sameL2 ligand frame and each bound terminally\nby two chloride ligands. One of the metal centres [M(2)] occupies\na bidentate pyridylimine pocket while the other [M(1)] a tridentate\ndipyridylimine cavity so as to generate a tetrahedral geometry at\nM(2) and a distorted square pyramidal geometry at M(1). Within\nthe ligand frame the pyridylimine and dipyridylimine moieties\nare both nearly planar with each of the planes being disposed\nalmost orthogonally to one another [torsion angles: N(3)\u2013C(18)\u2013\nC(19)\u2013N(4) 91.5\u25e6 (3a), 90.6\u25e6 (3c)].

At M(2), the M(2)\u2013Nimine\ndistance is similar to the M(2)\u2013Npyridyl bond length [3a 2.109(5)\nvs. 2.102(6) A\u02da; 3c 2.071(3) vs. 2.056(3) A\u02da]. There is no apparent\ndelocalisation of the imino double bond into the adjacent pyridyl\ngroup.\nAttempted crystallisation of 3b using the conditions applied for\n3a and 3c proved unsuccessful. However, by prolonged standing\nin chloroform adventitious reaction with water occurs to give\n[(L2)Ni2Br4(OH2)] [3b(H2O)] as orange crystals (Scheme 2). The\ndataset obtained for the single-crystal X-ray determination was,\nunfortunately, of poor quality. Nevertheless, the structure was\nunequivocal in revealing a bimetallic species displaying structural\nfeatures similar to that observed in 3a and 3c (vide supra) but with\none molecule of water additionally bound to the nickel centre\n[Ni(2)] occupying the bidentate cavity in L2. For comparison,\nTable 4 also contains the corresponding bond lengths and angles\nfor 3b(H2O).\nThe FAB mass spectra for 3a\u2013c show fragmentation peaks\ncorresponding to the loss of one or two halide groups from the\ncorresponding molecular ion peak.

Complex 2b was characterised by FAB\nmass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and by magnetic measure-\nments (seeTable 2 andExperimental section). In addition, a crystal\nof 2b has been the subject of a single-crystal X-ray diffraction\nstudy.\nCrystals of 2b suitable for the X-ray determination were grown\nby prolonged standing in chloroform. A view of 2b is shown in\nFig. 5; selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 5. The\nmolecular structure consists of a single nickel atom bound by both\nL2 and two terminal bromide ligands. As with its L1-containing\ncounterpart, 1b, the metal centre occupies the terpyridine cavity of\nthe bis(imino)terpyridine ligand. In this case, however, only one of\nthe imino groups is exo while the other is endo and forms a partial\ninteraction with the nickel centre [Ni(1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N(1) 2.537(2) A\u02da].\nThe effect of the interaction in comparison with 1b is two-fold.\nFirstly, an increase in the Br\u2013Ni\u2013Br angle from 129.51(6)\u25e6 in\n1b to 172.84(2)\u25e6 in 2b occurs so that the nickel assumes a more\noctahedral geometry in 3b.

The effect of\npartial coordination on the C\u2013N double bond length in the imine\nis minimal.\nThe FAB mass spectrum for 2b shows fragmentation peaks\ncorresponding to the loss of one or two bromide groups from\nthe molecular ion peak. In the IR spectra for 2b, m(C=N) bands\nat 1594 and 1630 cm\u22121 support the presence of both bound and\nfree imino groups, respectively. As with 1b, 2b is paramagnetic\nexhibiting amagneticmoment of 2.4 lB (Evans Balance at ambient\ntemperature) which is consistent with presence of two unpaired\nelectrons.\nConversion of yellow 2b to orange 3b can be achieved in\ngood yield by treating 2b with one equivalent of (DME)NiBr2\nin n-butanol at 110 \u25e6C for 30 min (Scheme 2). Similarly, 2b\ncould be converted to 3b on refluxing 2b with one equivalent\nof (DME)NiBr2 in dichloromethane for two days, these condi-\ntions also proving successful for the preparation of 3b directly\nfrom L2.\n2.3 Density functional theory calculations\nThe capacity of Lx, depending on the nature of the imino-carbon\nsubstituent, to have a selectivity for the number of metal(II)\nhalide units it binds was unexpected. Although it could be argued\nthat differences in electronic properties within the two ligand\nmanifolds (e.g., donor capability of the nitrogen donors within Lx\nis expected to follow the order: pyridine > ketimine > aldimine10)\nshould be influential, such a dramatic change in binding affinity\nwas nevertheless surprising. Therefore, a theoretical study on the\nrelative stability of mononuclear [(L2)MX2] and [(L1)MX2] was\ncarried out in order to investigate in more detail the energetic\nproperties of these systems. Specifically, density functional calcu-\nlations have been performed on ZnCl2-containing complexes and\nis likely, given the similarity of the experimental results, to be\nrepresentative of the other metal halide systems employed in this\nwork.\nFor both L1 and L2, B3LYP calculations have been undertaken\non mono-zinc dichloride species in conformations 1Lx and 2Lx\n(Fig. 6) which are based on the conformations adopted in\nstructurally determined 1c and 2b. In addition, hypothetical\nspecies 4Lx derived from the removal of one zinc dichloride unit\nfrom the bidentate pocket in bimetallic 3c are also studied. As\n1c is the only monometallic ZnCl2 structure characterised by\nX-ray diffraction, it was used to test our theoretical approach.\nFor this configuration, theoretical (1L1) and experimental (1c)\nstructures are in good agreement with the discrepancies found\nbeing less than 0.07 A\u02da for the bond lengths and 10\u25e6 for the\nangles (see Tables 3 and 6). The coordinated terpyridine portion\nof the ligand remains planar with an out of plane displacement of\n0.03 and 0.05 A\u02da for the theoretical and experimental structures,\nrespectively [Fig. 7(ii)]. It is likely that any discrepancies can be\nattributed to the vacuum conditions of the calculations.

The resulting structure exhibits\na geometry substantially distorted when compared with its coun-\nterpart 1L1 [Fig. 7(iii) vs. (ii)]. Inspection of the coordination sphere\naround zinc in 1L2 indicates that N2 and N2A atoms lie further\naway from the metal centre [Zn(1)\u2013N(2)\/N(2A) 2.42 A\u02da (1L2) vs.\nZn(1)\u2013N(2)\/N(2A) 2.29 A\u02da (1L1)] implying that the chelating ability\nof L2 in this coordination mode is substantially reduced (Table 6).\nThis observation is likely linked to the steric constraints imposed\nby the methyl units of the imino-carbon groups which are in close\nproximity in this conformation [Fig. 7(iii)]. The geometry around\nthe metal is also altered in the fact that both chlorine atoms while\nequivalent in 1L1 are non-equivalent in 1L2 leading to a distorted\nstructure intermediate between trigonal-bipyramidal and square-\nbased pyramidal. The planarity of the tridentate portion of the\nligand is significantly reduced in comparison with 1L1 [out of plane\ndisplacement: 0.31 A\u02da (1L2) vs. 0.03 A\u02da (1L1)].Overall, amonometallic\nzinc dichloride species supported by L2 exhibits a considerable\ndeformation when it is forced to adopt a type-1 conformation.\nSecondly, a theoretical study ofmono-zinc dichloride complexes\nbound by respectively L2 (2L2) or L1 (2L1) in conformations\nadopted in the structurally characterised nickel bromide complex\n2b [Fig. 7(iv)], was undertaken. As a first observation, it is noted\nthat the optimised structure of 2L2 does not show any noticeable\nchangeswhen comparedwith 2b, apart from the expected variation\nin metal\u2013nitrogen distances [Fig. 7(v) vs. (iv) and Tables 5 and 6].\nIndeed, 2L2 remains in a distorted octahedral geometry with its\nfour nitrogen donor ligands from L2 occupying the equatorial\nsites and the halide ligands axial. Two of the Zn\u2013N distances are\nelongated [Zn(1)\u2013N(1) 2.55 A\u02da and Zn(1)\u2013N(4) 2.54 A\u02da] indicative\nof a weaker coordination to the metal centre. In addition, the\nplanarity of thepyridine ringswithinL2 is reducedwhen compared\nwith structurally determined 2bwith an increase in the out of plane\ndisplacement evident [0.08 (2b) vs. 0.21 A\u02da (2L2)]. Nevertheless,\nbased on these observations, it would seem that [(L2)ZnCl2]\nwhen adopting a type-2 conformation is structurally possible. By\ncontrast, the optimised structure for [(L1)ZnCl2] (2L1) indicates a\nmore distorted geometry than in 2L2 [Fig. 7(vi) vs. (v)]. Although\nthe Zn(1)\u2013N(4) distance is slightly shorter in this complex [2.44\n(2L1) vs. 2.54 A\u02da (2L2)], the Zn(1)\u2013N(1) distance is substantially\nlonger [2.70 A\u02da (2L1)], while the out of plane displacement of the\npyridine rings is increased further than in 2L2 [0.37 A\u02da (2L1) vs.\n0.21 A\u02da (2L2)]. Indeed, the geometry at metal centre in 2L1 could be\n2356 | Dalton Trans., 2006, 2350\u20132361 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n22\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n06\n.

All hydrogen atoms have\nbeen omitted for clarity.\ndescribed as more five-coordinate than six-coordinate. Therefore,\non comparison of the hypothetical zinc complexes 2L2 and 2L1, it\nwould seem that the presence of an endo-oriented imino group\nstabilises an octahedral-type conformation in the L2 system while\nit leads to a significant structural rearrangement for theL1 system.\nThirdly, to examine the possibility for equilibration of\nmonometallic species in solution (Scheme 4, vide supra) and\nto probe potential intermediates in the formation of bimetallic\nspecies (e.g., 3c), a hypothetical mono-zinc species has been\ngenerated by removing one ZnCl2 molecule from structurally\ncharacterised 3c. Specifically, we have focused on a conformation\n(4L2), in which the single ZnCl2 unit is bound in the tridentate\niminobipyridine pocket within L2 [N(1), N(2) and N(3)]; the\ncorresponding 4L1 has also been studied [Fig. 7(viii) and (ix)].\nA structural reorganisation is observed on inspection of the\ntheoretical (4Lx) and experimental structures (3c) and consists of a\nchange of the relative positions of the chloride ligands on themetal\ncentre. This structural rearrangement is linked to a permutation\nin and out of the medium plane of the N(2)- and N(3)-containing\npyridine rings. These changes are most likely due to the absence of\na second metal centre and the isolated condition of the complex in\nthe theoretical calculations. The most important feature though,\nis that both theoretical structures do not produce any noticeable\nstructural discrepancies (see Tables 4 and 6) with a difference in\nbond lengths of 0.04 A\u02da and in angles of 4.2\u25e6.\nSeveral points emerge from inspection of the relative energies of\nthe optimised structures established for the mono-zinc dichloride\nspecies, 1L1 (1c), 1L2, 2L2, 2L1, 4L2 and 4L1 (Table 7). Firstly, a\ncomparison of the [(L1)ZnCl2] structures indicates that a con-\nformation based on type-1 is substantially preferred to the other\ntwo possible conformations [DE = 9.56 (2L1) and 8.75 kcal mol\u22121\n(4L1)]. Secondly, all the [(L2)ZnCl2] structures display energies\nScheme 4 Possible equilibria for [(Lx)ZnCl2] in solution (Ar = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3; X = halide).\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006 Dalton Trans., 2006, 2350\u20132361 | 2357\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n22\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n06\n.

Overall, the data for these species indicate a clear\npreference for [(L1)ZnCl2] to exist in a type-1 conformation, while\nfor [(L2)ZnCl2], the closeness in the relative energies between the\ndifferent conformations (1L2, 2L2, 4L2) suggests that an equilibrium\nis likely in the gas phase but with a slight preference towards 4L2. It\nis worthy of note that for both ligands the type-2 conformation is\nthe least stable of all although, given the accuracy of the theoretical\nmethod employed, the significance of this inference should be\ntreated with some caution. However, the isolation and structural\ncharacterisation only in the case NiBr2 derivative 2b suggests that\nthe nature of the halide group may have a stabilising influence for\nthis particular conformation. This will be the subject of further\nstudy elsewhere.\nIn summary, the density functional study carried out on the\nmonometallic ZnCl2 species with L1 and L2 as the ligand frame\nsupports the experimental observations and indicates that the\nnature of the substituent on the imino-carbon moiety has a\ndramatic effect on the stability of themonometallic species. Several\npoints emerge from the study. Firstly, it is apparent that the\ndifference in the stability of species adopting conformation 1Lx\nis mainly steric in origin which in turn directly influences the\nchelating properties around the metal. In the case of L1 steric\ninteractions are minimised while good coordination within the\nterpyridine moiety is maximised. This stability allied with the\nsubstantial reduction of the solvent accessibility to the metal\ncentre in this conformation would appear to suggest why 1L1\n(1c) does not react with a further molecule of ZnCl2 to form a\nbimetallic complex. Secondly, for L2, all three conformations 1L2,\n2L2 and 4L2 are distorted and can be considered as isoenergetic.\nThese two points together indicate that an equilibrium could be\noperational in solution for L2 but not for L1 (Scheme 4). It would\nbe expected, therefore, that further addition of amolecule of ZnCl2\nto [(L2)ZnCl2] would drive the equilibrium towards the right hand\nside and allow occupation of the bidentate pocket in 4 to furnish\nbimetallic complex 3.\n3 Conclusions\nThe bulky bis(imino)terpyridine ligand Lx has been used as an\neffective scaffold to support one or two metal(II) halide units.\nThe nature of the imino-carbon substituent is found to have an\neffect on the number of metal halide units the ligand can bind\nwith the aldimine ligand L1 showing a strong preference for a\nsingle unit while the ketimine L2 has the capacity to bind one\nor two metal centres. These experimental results have been further\ncomplemented byDFT calculations which reveal that a significant\nenergy gap is apparent for L1-containing systems leading to a\nstabilised conformation of type-1 and also suggests that dynamic\nbehaviour is likely for L2-supported species leading to bimetallic\nformation.\n4 Experimental\n4.1 General\nAll reactions, unless otherwise stated, were carried out under an\natmosphere of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen, using standard Schlenk\ntechniques or in a nitrogen purged glovebox.
