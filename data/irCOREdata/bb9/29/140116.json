Many companies now recognise\nthe central role supplier management plays in achieving long term\ncompetitive advantage. This paper presents the results of a study of\nsupplier management practices in Germany, contrasted against those in\nthe United Kingdom. It identifies a key difference \u2013 German\nmanufacturers have not reduced their supplier base as much as the\ncompanies in the UK. However, it appears that German manufacturers\nwill be reducing their supplier base in the near future, although they are\nlikely to follow a policy of multiple sourcing rather than single-\nsourcing from suppliers. The results of the research have strong\nimplications for German companies \u2013 they clearly indicate the potential\nfor performance improvement through the adoption of best practices in\nthe field of supplier management.\nKey words: supply chain management, supplier base trend.\n3INTRODUCTION\nSupply chain management has received much attention from both academics and\npractitioners in the last 20 years. One important aspect of supply chain management is\nthe configuration of the supplier base. Consequently, in today\u2019s competitive business\nenvironment, many manufacturing companies are focusing on supplier management as\na means of achieving long-term competitive advantage. Current thinking is that\ncompanies should reduce the number of suppliers with whom they do business in\norder to establish close long-term relationships with their remaining suppliers. As a\nresult of this best practice \u2013 closer co-operation \u2013 suppliers can then play a key role by\ncontributing to new product design, reducing costs, and constantly improving quality.\nSeveral writers, in the US and the UK, have recognised that there is a trend among\nmanufacturing companies to reduce their supplier base (e.g. Harland, 1996). However,\nthere has been little empirical research on supplier management in other leading\nindustrialised countries, such as Germany. The German manufacturing sector is very\nstrong \u2013 24.8% of the workforce is employed in manufacturing and this sector is\nresponsible for 25% of the GDP (Anonymous, 1998). For many years the\ncompetitiveness of the German manufacturing industry has been the subject of much\nforeign admiration (Simon, 1992). However with high labour costs and taxes, this lead\nhas been eroded. Over the last few years there has been much debate in Germany on\nthe viability of locating manufacturing operations within that country \u2013 the so-called\n4Standort Deutschland debate (for some examples about this discussion see, Brinkler\net al, 1997; Henkel, 1997). The view among many writers in Germany is that in order\nto become more competitive, its manufacturing sector should adopt more \u201cbest\npractices\u201d from abroad (Lay et al, 1996; Kinkel & Wengel, 1997). Therefore, it is\nimportant to determine whether supplier management is an area where German\nmanufacturers have adopted best practices. To achieve this, a study was conducted\nwhich investigated:\n\uf0b7 the trend in the number of suppliers used by German manufacturers, contrasted\nwith the trend previously identified in the UK\n\uf0b7 how German manufacturing companies manage their suppliers, for example, the\nextent to which single-sourcing is used.\nThe research results indicate a surprisingly slow adoption of international best\npractice by German companies. This has strong implications for German managers \u2013\nit indicates how performance could be improved; and for researchers \u2013 it shows that\nfurther research in this area is needed.\n5LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe Role of Supplier Management\nSupplier management is an important issue for all manufacturing companies because\nsuppliers can make a significant contribution to the achievement of manufacturers\u2019\nperformance objectives (Groves & Valsamakis, 1998; Monczka et al, 1993; Monczka\net al, 1998; Tan et al, 1999). Effective supplier management has been defined as the\n\u201corganisation of the optimal flow of high quality, value for money materials or\ncomponents to manufacturing companies from a suitable set of innovative suppliers\u201d\n(Goffin et al, 1997). Therefore close co-operation with suppliers can quickly bring\nlower unit costs (Sandelands, 1994; Christopher, 1997) and highest quality at lowest\ncost in the long-term (Burt, 1989; Larson, 1994). Good suppliers can also help\nmanufacturers during the development of new products and processes, with long-term\nquality improvements and cost reductions, and can provide enhanced delivery\nperformance (Monczka et al, 1993; Leenders et al, 1994; Waller, 1999).\nGerman writers have also acknowledged the key role of supplier management and\nadvocate companies in Germany to focus on this area (e.g., Godefroid, 1995; Wehrli\n& Wirtz, 1996; Becker, 1997). Consequently, the effective management of the supply\nchain is considered to be the major challenge facing German companies (Anonymous,\n1999). However, some writers (e.g. Friedrich et al, 1995) contend that few German\ncompanies have adopted the practice of \u201cpartnership\u201d with their suppliers and an\n6adversarial relationship with suppliers is more typical. Homburg (1995) is of the view\nthat supplier management in Germany needs to be not only recognised as an important\narea by practitioners but also needs to be investigated further by researchers.\nIt is clear from the literature that supplier management has an important role and\nthere are two key issues to be considered:\n\uf0b7 the trend in the supplier base \u2013 the tendency for leading companies to reduce their\nnumber of suppliers (due to the advantages it offers)\n\uf0b7 manufacturers sourcing policies \u2013 the approach taken i.e. whether or not companies\nare willing to reduce their supplier base to the extent that they mainly have \u201csingle-\nsource\u201d suppliers.\nEach of these issues will be covered in turn, based on a review of the relevant English\nand German literature.\nSupplier Base Trend\nCurrent management thinking recommends the establishment of long-term\nrelationships with a reduced number of suppliers. These few suppliers will then play a\ncritical role in contributing to new product development, reducing costs (significantly\nand regularly) and constantly improving quality. According to Harland (1996) and\nLeverick & Cooper (1998), there is a general trend among manufacturing companies\nto reduce their supplier base. There is a fair degree of anecdotal evidence to support\nthis view. For example, Sheth and Sharma (1997) reported that a number of major\n7manufacturers in the USA have reduced the number of suppliers they use: Xerox by\n90%, General Motors by 45% and Ford by 44%. Szymankiewicz and Canadine (1994)\nexpected this trend towards a smaller supplier base to continue in the future, but\noffered no empirical evidence. Generally, there is little empirical evidence to support\nthis assertion. The first major empirical investigation of supplier base reduction\n(outside the automotive sector) was undertaken in the UK by Goffin et al (1997). The\nstudy investigated the trend in supplier numbers in four industry sectors, and the key\nresults are shown in Table I.\ntake in Table I\nThe results show that UK manufacturing companies in 3 sectors dramatically\nreduced their supplier base. Companies in the process, engineering and electronics\nindustry sectors all reduced their supplier base by around 35%, between 1991 and\n1995. In contrast, the household products sector exhibited a significantly smaller\nreduction over the same period.\nThe evidence from the USA and UK demonstrates a reduction in the supplier base.\nHowever, what is the trend in supplier base size for German companies? Although\nthe importance of supplier management has been recognised by several German\nwriters (e.g. Godefroid, 1995; Homburg, 1995), evidence for supplier base reduction\nis sparse. Rommel (1991), in a study of 40 engineering companies concluded that\n8\u201cleading companies, we have found usually enter into long term, trust partnerships\nwith their suppliers\u201d, but gave no data on the change in supplier numbers. Homburg\n(1995), however, investigated managers\u2019 expectations of the change in supplier\nnumbers across 5 industries. Table II summarises the results of his investigation and\nindicates that the majority of manufacturers intended to keep the numbers of their\nsuppliers stable in the near future.\ntake in Table II\nThe limitation of Homburg\u2019s survey is that it was only based on managers\u2019\nperceptions of what would happen in the future. It neglected, for example, to establish\nthe exact size of the supplier base at the time of the survey (or in the past). Therefore,\nit was not possible to establish whether manufacturers had actually narrowed their\nsupply base prior to the survey and as a result intended to keep the numbers stable in\nthe future. This means that the results are somewhat ambiguous. Consequently, there\nis a real need to obtain empirical data from German manufacturers on supplier base\ntrends. Similarly, sourcing policy can be shown to require investigation.\nSourcing Policy\nIn the past, many manufacturers purchased the same parts or components from a\nnumber of suppliers \u2013 \u201cmulti-sourcing\u201d (Berry et al, 1994). However, since the end of\nthe last decade, US and UK manufacturing companies have started to use single-\n9sourcing (Ramsay & Wilson, 1990; Groves & Valsamakis, 1998). Single-sourcing\nmeans using only one source of supply for a particular material, or component part\n(Newman, 1988; Ramsay & Wilson, 1990). Between multi and single-sourcing sits\ndual-sourcing, which involves buying the part\/component from two suppliers (Berry et\nal, 1994).\nSingle-sourcing is claimed to lead to improved quality and better price (Tullous &\nUtecht, 1992; Christopher, 1998). In addition, it leads to closer relationships with\nsuppliers, as well as more tangible benefits such as fewer incoming defective parts,\ngreater delivery reliability and lower cost. Larson and Kulchitsky\u2019s (1998) survey of\npurchasing managers found that single-source suppliers normally delivered higher\nquality at a lower cost to the buyer. However, overall there has been very little\nempirical research carried out into the issue of single-sourcing (Brown & Inman,\n1993).\nIt has been suggested that German companies can benefit from a single-sourcing\napproach (Seitz, 1991). However, Nachtweh (1999) also saw risks and proposed that\nan emergency plan should always be in place to deal with single-source suppliers\nfailing to deliver. In common with the US and UK literature, there appears to be no\nempirical evidence as to the extent to which German manufacturing companies have\nadopted the single-sourcing.\n10\nLITERATURE REVIEW \u2013 MAIN CONCLUSIONS\nFrom the literature three main points can be concluded:\n\uf0b7 The importance of supplier management is recognised in both practitioner and\nacademic literature (describing the situation in the US, UK and Germany)\n\uf0b7 Literature on the US and UK identifies a trend to reduce the supplier base and gives\nsome empirical evidence of this. Some German writers indicate the benefits of a\nreduced supplier base. However, the only empirical evidence is a somewhat\nambiguous survey which suggests that managers at German manufacturing\ncompanies are not intending to reduce their supplier base\n\uf0b7 Writers discussing manufacturing in the US, UK and Germany mention the\nbenefits of single-sourcing. However, no research has been carried out into the\nextent to which German manufacturing companies have adopted this approach.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nGermany has a strong manufacturing base and the literature review showed the need\nfor empirical data on supplier management in that national context. The research\npresented in this paper addressed this need through a survey of supplier management\n11\npractices, covering not only the trends in supplier base size but also sourcing\nstrategies. There were five specific aims to the research:\n1. To determine the trend in the size of the supplier base of German manufacturing\ncompanies in three sectors.\n2. To compare the German trend with the findings from the same sectors of UK\nindustry.\n3. To determine whether German manufacturers intend to reduce this supplier base in\nthe future.\n4. To determine what German manufacturers consider to be the perceived benefits of\nhaving fewer suppliers.\n5. To investigate the sourcing policies used by German manufacturers.\nIn order to achieve the aims of the research a two-stage research design was\nutilised, as illustrated by Figure 1.\ntake in Figure 1\nIn Stage 1, a survey was used to collect directly comparable supplier base trend\ndata in Germany and the UK in order to be able to contrast differences (Aims 1 and 2).\nStage 2 consisted of a telephone survey of German managers to gather specific data on\ntheir supplier management practices (Aims 3 to 5).\n12\nStage 1 \u2013 Survey Data Analysis\nThe first stage of the research utilised survey data taken from the Best Factory Awards\ndatabase (BFA) in the UK and Germany. The Management Today\/Cranfield School of\nManagement Best Factory Awards have been running successfully in the UK in their\ncurrent form since 1992 (Management Today is the leading monthly management\nmagazine in the UK). Each year around 200 manufacturing companies enter the award\nscheme and this has created a large database of manufacturing performance data. The\nprogram has been extended to other countries to enable international comparisons to\nbe made and the BFA was launched in Germany in 1996.\nThe awards are open to any manufacturing plant in Germany or the UK; a plant is\ndefined as a relatively self-contained unit with its own management staff which can be\nidentified either by separate facilities, by separate products or by separate management\nstructure. Each plant has to complete a detailed 18 page questionnaire covering:\ndescriptive data (e.g. cost structure); management policy data (e.g. market\npositioning); and performance data (e.g. delivery reliability). The questionnaire\ncollects mainly quantitative (rather than qualitative) data at a specific level of detail so\nthat comparability across plants can be maintained. It does not, for example, rely on\nsubjective scoring (on, say, a 1 to 5 scale) which is open to considerable variability in\ninterpretation. Instead, questions focus on obtaining reliable data on key\nmanufacturing variables. A comparison between the BFA database and other survey\nstudies of manufacturing operations, and a discussion of its suitability for research\n13\npurposes, may be found in New and Szwejczewski (1995). The BFA questions on\nsupplier management focus mainly on supplier base changes over the past four years\nand have been discussed in a previous paper in this journal (Goffin et al, 1997).\nThe BFA database has been used to investigate manufacturing performance across\ndifferent industry sectors and, more recently, internationally (see for example New &\nSzwejczewski, 1995; New et al, 1998a). International comparisons are made possible\nby the fact that the same questionnaire is used in both the UK and Germany.\nSurvey data taken from the German and UK databases for the year 1997 were used\nfor Stage 1 of the research. The 1997 sample that was analysed consisted of 110\nGerman and 110 UK manufacturing plants. The majority of the research dealing with\nsupplier management has previously been conducted in the automotive sector, and so\nthe current study adopted a broader approach. Therefore, it did not focus solely on one\nsector; instead it examined supplier management in the engineering, electronics, and\nprocess sectors. The German sample contained 78 engineering, 20 electronics, and 12\nprocess plants, while the UK sample contained 56 engineering, 28 electronics, and 26\nprocess plants. Using the German\/UK BFA data, it was possible to answer the\nquestion of whether manufacturers in both countries had reduced their supplier base\n(over the period 1993 to 1997).\n14\nStage 2 \u2013 Telephone Survey\nThe second stage of the research focused exclusively on German manufacturing\ncompanies, primarily to determine whether or not they intended to reduce their\nsupplier base in the future. In addition, this stage probed for the perceived benefits of\nhaving fewer suppliers and the most appropriate sourcing policies, as perceived by\nmanagers \u2013 information that was not covered by the Stage 1 survey.\nA random sample stratified by three sectors was selected from the 110 German\nplants that entered the BFA in 1997 (i.e. from the German respondents to the Stage 1\nsurvey). This approach was followed to ensure that a representative sample of the\nthree industry sectors was identified and then a telephone survey of these German\nmanufacturers was conducted. The managers interviewed were senior\npurchasing\/materials management managers with responsibility for supplier chain\nmanagement.\nThe questionnaire used during Stage 2 was based on one previously developed by\nthe authors (Goffin et al, 1997). The original questionnaire had been piloted, and its\nreliability and validity established. A native speaker translated the questionnaire into\nGerman, and then an independent German expert from the supplier management field\nchecked the clarity of the questionnaire. In addition, 5 pilot interviews were\nundertaken in order to affirm that the interview structure \u2013 the questions as well as the\noverall flow of the questionnaire \u2013 was relevant and applicable to German\n15\nmanufacturers. The 5 pilot interviews did not form part of the final 34 interviews that\nwere analysed (see Figure 1). The random stratified sample (of 34 interviews)\nconsisted of 21 engineering companies, 9 electronics companies and 4 process\ncompanies. One of the research team (who is a native speaker) conducted all\ninterviews (including the pilot) in German, in order to avoid possible errors resulting\nfrom multiple interviewers. All the interviews were tape-recorded and full transcripts\nof the interviews were produced and used in the analysis. Since all the 34 companies\ncovered by the telephone survey had already completed the BFA questionnaire, full\nbackground data on their manufacturing operations and performance were available\nprior to the interviews.\nRESULTS\nStage 1 \u2013 Survey Data\nThe results from the survey data taken from the BFA (1997) database for Germany\nand the UK are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4 (and summarised in Table III).\nFigure 2 shows the changes in the supplier base over the two countries for the\nperiod 1993 to 1997 for the electronics sector.\ntake in Figure 2\n16\nIn the electronics sector, UK manufacturing plants have reduced the number of\nsuppliers from an average of 472 (in 1993), to 341 (in 1995), to an average of 253 (in\n1997) \u2013 this represents a reduction of approximately 46%. In contrast, the German\nelectronics plants have only reduced the supplier number by 8%, over the same period,\nfalling from 578 in 1993 to 532 in 1997. This result shows that the UK electronics\nplants have streamlined their supplier base to a much greater extent than the German\nelectronics companies.\nThe general characteristics of the plants in the two sample populations were\nchecked to determine if there were any differences in terms of size of plant,\ncomplexity of products (components\/product) and number of employees. There was\nno statistical difference to be found between the manufacturing plants in Germany and\nthe UK on these three characteristics, and therefore we may conclude that the samples\nwere, in fact, relatively well matched across these characteristics.\ntake in Figure 3\nA similar trend, to that seen in the electronics sector, can also be observed in the\nengineering sector. Figure 3 indicates that UK manufacturers have reduced their\nsupplier numbers from an average of 243 in 1993 to 155 in 1997. This was a reduction\nin supplier numbers of around 36% for the period 1993-97, whereas over the same\nperiod of time German companies have only reduced the number of suppliers by 5%\n17\n(falling from 240 in 1993 to 228 in 1997). Just as in the case of the engineering sector,\nthe general characteristics of the plants in the two sample populations were checked\nand no statistical differences were found.\ntake in Figure 4\nIn the process sector the results indicate a very different picture. Figure 4 shows\nthat whereas UK manufacturers have reduced their supplier base from 332 (in 1993)\nto 260 (in 1997), the German companies have increased their supplier base from 124\nto 143 over the same period of time. In the UK there has been a reduction of 22%,\nwhile in Germany there has been an increase of 15%. Again, no statistical differences\nwere found to be present between the two groups of plants for the three\ncharacteristics.\ntake in Table III\nOverall, the results indicate that the average size of the supplier base fell in the UK\nfrom 1993 to 1997, with the most dramatic reductions taking place in the electronics\nand engineering sectors. In contrast, the average size of the supplier base among\nGerman electronics and engineering plants fell by much smaller amount, and in the\ncase of the process sector it actually increased.\n18\nLet us now examine the changes in the supplier base in more detail. Table IV\nindicates, by industry sector, whether the UK and German plants had increased,\nreduced or maintained a stable supplier base over the period 1993-97 (using the same\nbase data as used for Figures 2, 3 and 4).\ntake in Table IV\nTable IV indicates that a large majority (68%) of the UK electronics plants had\nreduced their supplier base, while only 32% had increased theirs over the period 1993\nto 1997. However, in Germany only 55% of the plants had reduced their supply base\nand 40% had actually increased it.\nIn the case of the engineering sector we found that, again, a large majority of the\nUK plants (66%) had reduced their supplier base, with only 25% increasing the\nnumber of suppliers. However, in Germany the percentage of plants that reduced the\nsize of the supply base only slightly exceeded the number that increased the size of the\nbase (47% compared to 45% respectively).\nIn the process sector, the percentage of the UK plants that reduced their supply\nbase, while smaller than in the case of the engineering and electronics sector, was still\nmuch greater than the percentage that increased their supplier base. However, in the\n19\ncase of the German plants the percentage that increased their supplier base was nearly\ndouble the percentage that reduced the number with whom they dealt.\nOverall, Table IV indicates that the majority of the UK plants in all three sectors\nhad reduced the size of their supply base over the period 1993-97. However, in the\ncase of the German electronics sector, while the majority (55%) of the plants had\nreduced the size of their supplier base, there was a sizeable percentage (40%) that had,\nin fact, increased the number of suppliers. In the case of the German engineering\nsector, the percentage of plants that had reduced their supplier base was only\nmarginally ahead of the percentage that had increased their supplier base. However, in\nthe case of the process sector, the position was reversed and the majority of German\nplants had actually increased the size of their supplier base.\nStage 2 \u2013 Telephone Survey\nThe results from the telephone survey cover 3 key areas:\n\uf0b7 Trends in supplier base size\n\uf0b7 Benefits of a reduced supplier base\n\uf0b7 Purchasing strategy\n20\nTrends in Supplier Base\nStage 2 of the research examined in detail German manufacturers approaches to\nsupplier management. At the start of the interviews, respondents were asked about the\nimportance of supplier management. The telephone interviews indicated that the\noverwhelming majority (79%) of the respondents stated that the importance of\nsupplier management had increased over the last 3 years. As one manager at an\nelectronics company commented \u201cthe relationship with our suppliers is nearly as\nimportant as that with our customers\u201d (Purchasing Manager, Electronics). Another\nmanager commented \u201cwe are only as good as our suppliers are\u201d (Purchasing Manager,\nEngineering).\nThe analysis of the data (from Stage 1) identified that 44% (15 out of 34) of the\ncompanies had reduced their supplier base over the period 1993-97. The respondents\nat the companies that had reduced their supplier base were asked to state what the\nfuture trend in their supply base would be. Table V shows the results.\ntake in Table V\nThe data presented in Table V indicates that overall, 41% of the plants intend to\nreduce their supplier numbers, while only a small percentage intend to increase their\nsupply base. If we examine the trend by sector, we can see that in the process sector\n21\nthe plants mainly intend to keep the number constant, while in the electronics and\nengineering sectors a large percentage intend to reduce their supplier base.\nFurther analysis of the data uncovered the fact that of the 14 plants who intended to\nreduce their supply base in the future, 12 (85%) had already reduced their supplier\nbase over the period 1993-97. This finding suggests that supplier base reduction is an\non-going rather than a one-off activity and also that the plants which have not reduced\nhave also not yet recognised the need.\nBenefits of a Reduced Supplier Base\nOf the total 34 respondents to the telephone survey, 15 had reduced their supplier base\nover the period 1993-97. These 15 respondents were asked to identify the benefits of\nthis reduction, Table VI shows their answers. In total five different advantages were\nmentioned.\ntake in Table VI\nJust over half of the respondents mentioned that they had the benefit of lower\nprices from their suppliers. Reduction in the supplier base means that bigger order\nvolumes can be offered to the remaining suppliers who, in turn, provide lower prices.\nThe research results suggest that only 53% of the plants were experiencing this\nbenefit. This may be due to the fact that the other 47% have not been able to offer\n22\ntheir remaining suppliers sufficiently big order volumes to warrant significant price\nreductions. Another benefit of the reduced supplier base is said to be lower\nadministration costs for purchasing. While some plants did not experience the benefits\nof lower prices, they certainly mentioned that they enjoyed lower admin costs; another\nbenefit that can come from supplier reduction. A large percentage (53%) of the\nrespondents also mentioned that they found it easier to manage fewer suppliers.\nWhile the most frequently mentioned benefits of a reduced supplier base were\nquantitative in nature, the respondents also mentioned qualitative benefits. Just over\n25% of the respondents reported that they enjoyed improved communications. Also\n27% of the respondents said they had experienced improved relations with their\nsupplier base. It is interesting that more of the respondents did not mention that they\nenjoyed improved communications or relations with their suppliers. This may be due\nto the fact that these benefits do not come as quickly as the three quantitative benefits\nmentioned by the respondents. Improved communications or relations come about, in\npart from the company working with its suppliers, rather than simply happening as a\nresult of supplier numbers being reduced. The reason why more of the respondents did\nnot mention that they saw improved communications or relations might be because\nthey have not put enough effort into realising these benefits. This could be due to the\nfact that, as Friedrich et al (1995) found, most companies do not have a \u201cpartnership\u201d\nrelationship with their suppliers, preferring instead to use the adversarial approach.\n23\nIn addition, to determining the benefits of reducing the supplier base, the\nrespondents were asked if the benefits had been measured. For example, had the\nrespondents actually measured the financial impact on the bottom line of having\nreduced their supplier base? They were also asked if they had quantified the other\nbenefits of having a smaller supplier base. The analysis indicated that only 7\nmanufacturing companies had quantified the benefits of having a smaller supplier base\nand so, for the majority, the benefits were perceived rather than actual. The\ncompanies that had quantified the benefits had only done so with regard to the cost\nsavings they were making. None of them had examined the more qualitative benefits\nthat were mentioned.\nThe literature indicated that there were a number of benefits to be gained from a\nreduction in the supplier base, especially lower cost and improved communication\nwith suppliers. However, the results of this research appear to indicate that financial\nbenefits (i.e. lower prices, lower costs) dominate for the majority of plants. The more\nqualitative benefits, suggested by the literature, appear to have been experienced by\nfewer plants only.\nPurchasing Strategy\nRespondents were asked about their overall purchasing strategy, in particular did they\nadopt a single-sourcing approach? The results indicate that very few of the companies\nactually used this approach. Table VII indicates that only 9% of the plants had a\n24\nsingle-sourcing policy (single active) for all or part of their supplier requirements.\nAround 50% of the plants adopted a multi-supplier strategy and the remaining plants\nused a dual-sourcing approach.\ntake in Table VII\nIt was apparent from the interviews that the companies appeared to prefer a dual or\nmulti-sourcing policy rather than using the sole supplier approach. A few companies\noffered a reason for adopting a dual or multi-sourcing. Some of the respondents\nmentioned that they did not wish to become dependent on just one supplier - one\nmanager stated: \u201cin general, we dual-source our components, we have to be prepared\nif one supplier cannot supply ... we have to be flexible - focusing on one supplier\nresults in dependency\u201d (Purchasing Manager, Engineering). Two respondents stated\nthat the reason they used dual\/multi-sourcing approach was because of the need to\nensure the supply of critical components. They did not want to jeopardise their\nproduction by only having one supplier \u2013 in the event of late delivery the plant could\nbe forced to reduce, or even stop, production. For some plants, the critical nature of\nsome of their raw materials and components may have caused them to adopt the\ndual\/multi-sourcing policy, thereby ensuring that their production system was\nprotected from interruptions caused by late delivery of their suppliers. While this may\nhave been a reason why some decided not to adopt single-sourcing, for others it was\nmore likely their conservatism \u2013 as one respondent noted \u201cIt would be nice to have\n25\none supplier, but this is an absolutely Utopian concept\u201d (Chief Executive Officer,\nElectronics).\nThe extent to which supplier performance was monitored was also investigated.\nThe interviews uncovered the fact that the majority of the companies had a supplier\nmonitoring system in place \u2013 82% of the companies (28 out of the 34) monitored their\nsupplier performance. Although the majority of the plants monitored their supplier\nperformance, the interviews showed that the factors monitored were in fact \u2018standard\u2019\nparameters \u2013 such as quality and delivery reliability.\nThe respondents were also asked which companies they considered to be leaders in\nsupplier management. The answers to this question surprised the authors; around 82%\nof the respondents were unable to provide the name of a company, which they\nconsidered to be a leader in supplier management. As one of the managers interviewed\ncommented \u201cNo, I cannot name any other company ... I think other organisations are\nno different from us\u201d (Purchasing Manager, Electronics). For the 18% of the\nrespondents (6 out of the 34) who were able to name a leading company, the names\ngiven came from the computer industry (e.g. Dell), and the automotive sector (e.g.\nBMW). It would appear that there is little understanding among German\nmanufacturing organisations about which companies are \u201cworld class\u201d in the area of\nsupplier management. Therefore, it seems that managers in German manufacturing\ncompanies do not have a yardstick against which to compare themselves and are not\n26\nreally aware of the improvements that can result from adopting best practices in the\narea of supplier management.\nSUMMARY & DISCUSSION\nAchieving effective supplier management is a critical area for manufacturers and\nlikely to remain so for some time to come. The US\/UK literature suggests that there is\na trend towards reducing the size of the supply base. However, while the German\nliterature emphasised the importance of supplier management there has been very\nlittle empirical research examining the trend in supplier numbers used. The research\npresented in this paper has tried to rectify this deficiency and the key results can be\nsummarised as follows:\n\uf0b7 The research identified that over the last few years UK manufacturing plants had\nsignificantly reduced their supplier base, but German plants had only slightly\nreduced their supplier numbers.\n\uf0b7 The telephone survey of German manufacturers showed that a large number of\nthem were planning to make reductions in the near future.\n\uf0b7 The analysis determined that a large proportion of the German companies that had\nreduced their supplier base in the past intended to continue the process in the\nfuture. This finding suggests that supplier reduction is not a one-off action, rather\nan activity that takes place over a period of time.\n27\n\uf0b7 The research suggests that those German companies that had reduced their\nsupplier base (over the period 1993-97) considered the key benefit to be the lower\ncosts that this activity delivers. A smaller proportion of manufacturers reported\nimproved communication with their suppliers. However, only a few of the\ncompanies had actually quantified the extent of the benefits gained; the major\nquantified benefit was reduced cost.\n\uf0b7 The results showed that a sizeable majority of the German companies still used a\nmulti-sourcing approach. Few were prepared to be dependent on a single supplier.\n\uf0b7 The research also found that there was very little knowledge in Germany about\nwhich companies are leaders in supply chain management.\nThe findings of the research have implications for both researchers and managers.\nFor researchers, it shows the need for further study of supplier management in\nGermany. It is necessary to understand why some German companies have reduced\ntheir supplier base while many have not. A case study approach, contrasting\ncompanies which have reduced their supplier base against others that have not, might\nbe appropriate for exploring this issue. Overall, the research indicates that the\nadoption of modern supplier management practices is not widespread in Germany.\nThe use of leading edge approaches by German manufacturers could result in\nimprovements especially with regard to cost efficiency. However, the adoption of\nmodern manufacturing management approaches has generally been slow in German\ncompanies (Lay et al, 1996). Consequently supplier management offers an ideal\n28\ncontext in which researchers can study the diffusion of manufacturing best practice\ninto Germany. Such a study would be longitudinal in nature and it would be important\nto identify the characteristics of the German companies which are faster to adopt best\npractices.\nThe findings on the German approach to supplier management indicate the need for\nresearchers to study what is happening in other industrialised countries. Manufacturers\nin other countries may also consider supplier management to be important, but (like\ntheir German counterparts) may be in the early stages of recognising and applying best\npractice in this area. Therefore, the current study raises the research question: how\nquickly do manufacturing best practices spread across international boundaries? The\nauthors have anecdotal evidence that supplier management is probably more advanced\nin the automotive sector, than in other sectors in Germany. However, this anecdotal\nevidence raises yet another issue \u2013 is the automotive sector a major contributor to the\ndevelopment and spread of best practices across international boundaries? Overall,\nmuch has been written on manufacturing best practices and \u201cworld class\u201d\nmanufacturing. However, it is interesting that researchers have not yet recognised the\nneed to study the diffusion of this \u201cmanagement technology\u201d, using longitudinal\nstudies of sectors in several countries.\nThe research has many implications for German managers. It indicates that some\nGerman companies have not yet taken the advantage of a smaller supplier base.\n29\nConsequently, this suggests that German companies could obtain a competitive\nadvantage \u2013 those manufacturers which had reduced their supplier base had achieved\nlower costs (and some had data to prove the financial benefit). Manufacturers, in most\ncases, are still using a multi-sourcing policy \u2013 very few used the single-sourcing\napproach. A move away from reliance on multiple sources and towards a greater use\nof single-sourcing could result in cost reductions. The use of modern supplier\nmanagement techniques offers German companies a partial solution to the high costs\nof Standort Deutschland and would ensure the continued viability of manufacturing in\nGermany. Just as German companies have apparently been conservative in the\nadoption of best practices, this phenomenon may be found in other industrialised\ncountries \u2013 this also requires further investigation.\nThe findings also have strong implications for managers in the companies that\nsupply German industry. If more German manufacturers decide to implement supply\nbase reduction, then suppliers will need to be ready to respond. The managers of\nsuppliers will need to ensure that the products and services they offer are attractive\nand competitively priced. Overall, suppliers will need to adopt an appropriate strategy\nto ensure they are part of the chosen few, as supplier bases are reduced.\nAs with most research, the current study has limitations that are important to\nrecognise, so that future researcher can address them. Firstly, the samples used mean\nthat the results of the study are not representative of German industries as a whole.\n30\nThe BFA database contains information on companies that are self-selecting \u2013 they\nchoose, for benchmarking purposes, to enter the awards. If anything, by their\nwillingness to benchmark, these companies may well be more advanced than the\naverage organisation. To determine this, a wider study using, for example,\ngovernment listings of manufacturing organisations as a sample frame is required. The\ntelephone interviews also have a limitation in that the data collected is all \u201cmanager\nreported\u201d with no triangulation, for example, against company documentation.\nHowever, telephone lists are a cost-effective vehicle for data collection in situations\nwhere the concepts are clear. Although the possibility for misunderstanding existed,\nthe use of a native speaker to conduct this stage of the research minimised this\nproblem. Overall, however, on-site one-to-one interviews with managers would allow\nmore sources of data and a deeper understanding of supplier management in Germany.\nTherefore, further research using such an approach is planned.\nCONCLUSION\nOver the last few years there has been an intensive debate taking place in Germany\nabout the competitiveness of its manufacturing industry. However, new manufacturing\nmanagement concepts such as lean production that could contribute to German cost\ncompetitiveness, are only being slowly adopted. One of the concepts that could help\nimprove competitiveness is supplier management and in particular supplier base\n31\nreduction. This article has reported on research that, surprisingly, shows that German\nmanufacturers are slow to adopt best practices in this area. In comparison with UK\ncompanies, fewer German manufacturers have reduced their supplier base, although\nmany now intend to do so. A reduced supplier base has been shown by some\ncompanies to reduce costs and so others need to grasp this opportunity to become\nmore competitive. Also surprising was the lack of knowledge amongst many German\nmanagers of supply chain best practice. It will be interesting to see how long it takes\nbefore more German manufacturers achieve the lower costs or other advantages of\nhaving fewer suppliers.\nAlthough the study focused on supplier management in Germany, it identified a\nkey issue that is important in all national contexts \u2013 the spread of best practice\ninternationally. Studies of \u201cworld class\u201d manufacturing practices are common but the\ndiffusion of these ideas has not been researched. This is a rich vein which researchers\nneed to investigate.\n32\nREFERENCES\nAnonymous, (1998), \u201cMangel an systematischem Innovationsmanagement in der\nZulieferindustrie\u201d, Blick durch die Wirtschaft , 26 June.\nBecker, J.
