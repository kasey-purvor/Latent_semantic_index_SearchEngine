INTRODUCTION\nANEW concept, whereby a traveling-wave system was usedto feed a circular-polarized (CP) microstrip patch array,\nwas established by Lum et al. in [1] and [2]. Lum et al. pre-\nsented practical data from 5-GHz prototype antennas to support\nthe new concept. In this paper, we have introduced a signifi-\ncant extension to the basic design by using two parallel slotline\nfeeds to produce a dual-polarization antenna. Practical data are\npresented that verify the principle of the new dual-polarization\nantenna.\nThe basis of this study, as reported in the European Mi-\ncrowave Conference [2], was originally established by Huang\n[3], who used four probe-fed patches and a corporate feed\nstructure. In our case, the probe feeds are replaced with a\ncircular slotline channel of width , which runs in the ground\nplane beneath the patches. The concept of using a slotline to\nexcite a single patch was originally reported by Tang et al. [4].\nA traveling wave was excited in the slotline channel through a\nmicrostrip-to-slotline transition [5], [6].\nOne of the benefits of the antenna structure under investiga-\ntion is that the antenna is particularly suitable for inclusion in\nhighly integrated multilayer packages. Related to this, two ad-\nditional features have been investigated, namely, the use of a\nlow-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) structure and the use\nof mixed dielectrics. It is well known that LTCC offers a number\nof advantages for the fabrication of microwave circuits. Data is\nManuscript received October 7, 2005; revised January 5, 2006.\nK. M.

Multilayer fab-\nrication techniques, using thick-film or LTCC technology, also\noffer the potential for having layers of different permittivity. It\nis shown that this feature can be used to advantage by incorpo-\nrating a low dielectric layer beneath the patches so as to increase\nthe magnitude of the fringing field and, hence, increase the mag-\nnitude of the radiated signal.\nII. DUAL-CP ANTENNA STRUCTURE\nThe structure of the dual-polarization CP antenna is depicted\nin Fig. 1. It can be seen that the microstrip patches are fed\nthrough two parallel slots in the ground plane. A signal applied\nat port 1 will excite a signal traveling in the counterclockwise\ndirection in the outer of the two slots, and this will produce\nright-handed circular polarization (RHCP). Similarly, a signal\napplied at port 3 will excite a signal traveling clockwise in the\ninner slot, and this will excite the left-handed circular polarized\n(LHCP) signal. It can be seen that this is an extension of the\nsingle-slot antenna reported by the authors as in [2]. The key as-\npect of this structure is that there should be a distance of be-\ntween the feed points to the patches along the slotline. In order to\nreduce the overall size of the structure, a meander was inserted\ninto the slotline sections between each patch so as to reduce the\n0018-9480\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

It should be noted that, for both of the slot ex-\ncitations, there is a progressive offset of the patches relative to\nthe slotline, as the signal propagates around the appropriate slot.\nThis incremental offset is to ensure that each patch will receive\napproximately the same amount of coupled energy as the signal\npropagates around the slot, gradually decreasing in amplitude.\nThe offset of the slots relative to the patches is shown in Fig. 2. In\norder to prevent coupling between the slots, the spacing between\nthe slots was maintained at , where is the width of the slot.\nIt was found, both through simulation and experiment, that this\nspacing maintained the coupling between the slots below 25 dB.\nIt should be noted that the slotline channel is relatively narrow\nso that little signal was radiated from the feed.\nPhotographs of the 5-GHz test antennas are shown in Fig. 3.\nThese test antennas were fabricated on RT\/Duroid 5870 in\nwhich the substrate had a relative permittivity of 2.33 and a\nthickness of 1 mm. It should be noted that since only two con-\nductor layers were used in the test antennas, it was necessary\nto include the microstrip feed lines on the same surface as the\nradiating patches. This would be a problem if the antennas were\nused for receiving, as signals could be picked up directly on\nthe microstrip feed lines. However, the problem is resolved if\na three-conductor structure is used. This is demonstrated later\nin this paper when a three-conductor layer LTCC antenna is\ndescribed.\nFig. 4. Two-port network representation of a single patch.\nThe key dimensional data for the antennas shown in Fig. 3\nare mm, mm, incremental offset\nm, and slotline width m.\nIII. ANTENNA THEORY\nA theoretical analysis using matrix multiplication was used\nto study the behavior of a single-slot-fed antenna array of the\ntype described in [2], which incorporated a 500- m incremental\noffset. Initially, each patch and its associated slotline feed was\nrepresented by a two-port network in terms of scattering param-\neters. The reference planes for each slot-fed patch are shown in\nFig. 4. It should be noted that a spacing of between the ref-\nerence planes was chosen so that successive patches could be\nadded without the need for adding additional sections of slot-\nline.\nThe scattering parameters of each successive patch, with the\nincremental offset of 500 m, were obtained through simu-\nlation using Momentum. After obtaining the matrix\nfor the individual networks, the overall representation\nwas obtained through matrix multiplication. The validity of\nthe analysis was demonstrated when the overall repre-\nsentations were converted back to -parameters and compared\nwith measurement. For example, the theoretical value of\n11.5 dB compared very well with the measured value of\n12.3 dB, which was presented in [2].\nTo aid the understanding of the behavior of individual\npatches, plots are given in Figs. 5 and 6 that show how and\nfor an individual patch vary with the incremental offset.\nIn Fig. 5, we see that there is a greater change in for small\nand large values of incremental offset. This can be explained in\nterms of conventional transmission-line theory and the standing\nwave that will exist in the patch at resonance. Fig. 6 shows a\nwell-behaved characteristic, in which decreases steadily\nwith an increase in the offset, which is reasonable since more\npower will be lost through the patch due to radiation as the offset\nincreases. It can be shown that as a function of incremental\noffset gives a logarithmic characteristic. The usefulness of this\nstudy is that we can predict the effect of the offset and, thus,\ndesign future arrays without the need to simulate the effects of\nall the individual patches. Through correct design of the offsets,\nit can also be arranged that the majority of the energy traveling\nin the slotline will be coupled onto the radiating patches with\nminimum energy dissipated in the slotline termination.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SUMMARY OF KEY RESULTS FOR\nSINGLE-SLOT CP ANTENNA\nIn order to make a proper comparison of the performance of\nthe dual-slot antenna, we have summarized the key parameters\nof a single-slot antenna, already published in [2]. Table I sum-\nmarizes the optimum measured results for a single-slot antenna\nwith 700- m incremental offset at 5.04 GHz. Fig. 7 shows the\nhigh quality of circular polarization that can be obtained using\nthis new technique with a single-slot feed.\nThe results for the eight-patch array show a significant im-\nprovement in gain when compared with the results for the four-\npatch array reported in [1].\nV. DUAL-CP ANTENNA MEASUREMENT RESULTS\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the best match for the dual-polarization\nantenna was obtained at 4.99 GHz with an value less than\n30 dB. This matching frequency is close to the designed value\nof 5 GHz. The bandwidth of the proposed antenna\nis approximately 21.2%. The maximum gain measured over this\nbandwidth is approximately 14.8 dBi. Fig. 9 shows the isolation\nbetween the two slotlines. The best isolation is obtained close\nFig. 7.

It\ncan be seen that the high quality of circular polarization obtained\nwith a single slot, and displayed in Fig. 7, has been maintained.\nSome reductions in the CP quality may be due to received\nsignals being picked up directly on the microstrip lines during\nthe measurement process. This problem can be solved by imple-\nmenting the multilayer structure, as introduced in Section VI,\nto allow the microstrip feed line to be on the reverse side of the\nantenna.\nThe simulated and measured radiation patterns for both hands\nof polarization are shownin Figs.14 and 15, and it canbeseen that\nessentially the same characteristics are obtained in each case.\nFig. 13.

MULTILAYER LTCC CP ANTENNA STRUCTURE\nAND MEASUREMENTS\nIn order to validate the new design, a single-slot-fed antenna\nwas fabricated and tested using a different material (LTCC) and\nat a different frequency (15 GHz).

Multilayer LTCC antenna layer configuration.\nis shown in Figs. 16 and 17. The multilayered nature of the\nstructure permitted the microstrip feed lines to be positioned on\nthe opposite side to the radiating patches, thus enabling the an-\ntenna to be used for receiving. The LTCC antennas consisted of\ntwo thick layers of dielectric, each composed of four layers of\nDuPont 951 LTCC tape (245- m thick). The slotline feeding the\npatches was formed in a buried ground. Vias were used to make\nan electrical connection between pads on the upper surface and\nthe buried ground plane. The pads were necessary to earth the\nsubminiature A (SMA) connectors. The vias were laser drilled\nand filled with an injection via filler using DuPont 6141 Ag via\npaste. The diameter of the vias was 200 m. The buried ground\nplane and the patches on the top surface were screen printed\nusing DuPont 6142 Ag conductor paste and co-fired. Finally, the\nfeed lines on the bottom side were printed using DuPont 6160\nsilver paste, and after post firing, the antennas were cut from the\npanel to their final size.\nThe large uniform ground plane in this structure, approxi-\nmately 65 mm 65 mm, caused extra challenges for manufac-\nturing. The main danger was substrate warping caused by the\nshrinkage mismatch of the conductive paste and the ceramic\nsheet. However, in this case, the ground plane was located sym-\nmetrically in the center of the substrate and, thus, the shrinkage\nof the plane is equally restricted from both sides and warping\nwas avoided. The burnout period of the firing profile given by\nDuPont was also revised. To ensure the removal of all organics,\na very slow heating rate of 2 C\/min from room temperature up\nto 500 C, and 1-h dwell time at this temperature was used. This\nprocess provided a defect-free structure without any interlayer\ndelamination and surface blistering, which are likely to occur\nwith this kind of high-volume substrate having large uniform\nground planes.\nThe antenna that was fabricated on LTCC DuPont 951 mate-\nrial had the following parameters:\n1) single fired thickness: m;\n2) dielectric constant: ;\n3) loss tangent: .\nFig. 18. Fabricated multilayer LTCC antenna. (a) Top plane. (b). Bottom plane.\nFig. 19. Simulated and measured S for multilayer LTCC antenna.\nThe incremental offset of the patches was set at 100 m with a\nslotline width , 200 m. The patch dimensions were\nm and m. As with the other antennas that\nwere investigated, the patches were spaced along the cir-\ncular slotline.\nPhotographs of the fabricated LTCC antenna array are shown\nin Fig. 18(a) and (b), where (a) is the top view and (b) is the\nbottom view of the substrate. View for the slotline channel is not\nfeasible since it is located in the buried ground plane. Overall\ncircuit dimension is 65 mm 65 mm.\nComparison of the simulated and measured data for the re-\nturn loss are presented in Fig. 19. Optimum measured return loss\nwas obtained at 15.04 GHz with values less than 20 dB. Band-\nwidth of the LTCC antenna array (voltage standing-wave ratio\n(VSWR) 2) is 2.7% and the corresponding optimum measured\ngain over this bandwidth is approximately 7.8 dBi. Reasonably\ngood agreement between the simulated and measured radiation\npattern of the antenna is demonstrated at 15.03 GHz, as shown\nin Fig. 20.\nGood quality circular polarization existed at 14.90 GHz, as\nshown in Fig. 21. This is verified by the simulated and measured\ndata of the 3-dB axial ratio, as plotted in Fig. 22. The 3-dB axial\nratio bandwidth of the LTCC antenna array is 1.7%.\nVII. MULTILAYER THICK-FILM RADIATION ENHANCED\nPATCH ANTENNA STRUCTURE AND THEORY\nIt is well known that there will be a concentration of charge\nalong the edges of a resonant patch, giving rise to fringing fields.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

HFSS modeling of dual low dielectric-constant regions configuration\nincorporated with 1000-\u0016m offset between center of the slotline and center of\nthe patch.\nIn order to improve the efficiency of radiation of the new struc-\nture, a theoretical investigation based on electromagnetic simu-\nlation was performed to examine the effect of placing strips of\nlow dielectric-constant material beneath the radiating edges of\nthe patch to enhance the fringing fields\nAs shown in Fig. 23, two thin regions of low dielectric-con-\nstant thick-film dielectric material is arranged beneath and in\nparallel with the radiating edges of the patch. Due to the pres-\nence of the low dielectric-constant material, repulsive forces of\nthe like charges on the bottom surface of the patch are strength-\nened. Thus, the fringing fields at the radiating edges signifi-\ncantly improved, while the effect on the overall patch dimen-\nsions is negligible.\nFig. 24 shows the model used in HFSS; this shows the two\nregions of low dielectric constant, with the slotline offset by\n1000 m from the center of the patch. The same basic model,\nbut without the low dielectric regions, was then used to verify\nthe enhanced performance due to the inclusion of these regions.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 25(a) and (b), that the presence of\nthe low dielectric material increases the intensity of the electric\nfield distribution at the patch edges by around 40%. To further\nestablish the validity of this unique technique, a greater offset of\n2000 m was considered, and the results are shown in Fig. 25(c)\nand (d). Again we see an increase in the radiation intensity of\naround 40%.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on March 18,2010 at 07:40:03 EDT from IEEE Xplore.

(c) 2000-\u0016m offset. (d) 2000-\u0016m offset with two regions of low\ndielectric-constant material.\nThus the concept of using low dielectric-constant material\nsections has been verified from the results of simulation. The\ntechnique seems particularly suitable for use with the CP an-\ntennas under consideration because of the general suitability of\nthe whole structure for implementation in multilayer thick-film\nor LTCC formats.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThe concept of a new dual-polarization CP antenna has\nbeen established through simulation and practical measure-\nment. Moreover, it has been shown that the technique can be\nsuccessfully employed at different frequencies, namely, 5 and\n15 GHz. Two different processes were used to manufacture test\nantennas, conventional etching, and LTCC and, in both cases,\nthe results were very good. A radiation enhancement method,\nusing regions of low dielectric constant, has been demonstrated\nboth through simulation and measurement. The technique\nseems particularly suitable for use in multilayer microwave cir-\ncuits, and particularly highly integrated multilayer transceiver\npackages.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the assistance and support\nof R.
