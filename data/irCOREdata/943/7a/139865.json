Reilly, S.W. James and R.P. Tatam \n \n \n \nTwo novel external cavity lasers are demonstrated experimentally. The first utilises a \nBragg grating fabricated in highly birefringent optical fibre and offers the ability to \nswitch between modes that are separated in polarisation and wavelength. The second \nutilises two spatially separate Bragg gratings fabricated in mono-mode fibre. Both can be \nused for tuneable beat frequency generation. \n \nIntroduction: Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) external cavity semiconductor lasers have been \ninvestigated as stabilised continuous wave and modulated laser sources, and as tuneable \nsources [1]. These lasers can offer narrow linewidths and a viable cost effective \nalternative to distributed feedback laser diodes and distributed Bragg reflector laser \ndiodes. Dual wavelength lasers have also been the subject of considerable research \ninterest as sources capable of producing beat signals at microwave frequencies, which is \ndesirable for electronic signal processing systems [2-4]. Beat frequencies have been \ngenerated previously using separate laser cavities [3,4]. However, systems employing \nseparate cavities can suffer from phase noise and drift, making a single cavity dual \nwavelength laser preferable for producing stable beat frequencies. In this paper two novel \nFBG external cavity lasers are experimentally demonstrated. Both use the light reflected \nfrom the FBGs to force the lasers to operate at the Bragg wavelengths.  \n 2\nHi-Bi laser: The first laser configuration considered is based on High Birefringence (Hi-\nBi) fibre and exploits the difference in the wavelength of the Bragg reflection of light \npopulating the orthogonally linearly polarised eigenaxes of Hi-Bi fibre. Feedback from a \nFBG written in Hi-Bi fibre then results in the laser operating on two linearly polarised \nlongitudinal modes that are separated in both wavelength and polarisation. A Hi-Bi fibre \nwith a beat length of \u2248 1.6mm will produce a corresponding wavelength separation of \u2248 \n0.3nm between the orthogonally linearly polarised modes of the reflection from the FBG. \nThe fibre used was Fibercore bow-tie, (HB 750) with a numerical aperture of 0.15. The \nfibre was hydrogen loaded for 7 days in a pressure vessel at 130 bar. The FBG was \nsubsequently fabricated using a wavelength tuneable UV source and phase mask based \ninterferometer [5]. The FBG had a centre wavelength of 810nm, a reflectivity of \u2248 40% \nand a bandwidth of 0.15nm (FWHM) and was located 250mm from the end of the fibre. \nThe fibre end was angle polished to reduce unwanted reflections into the active laser \ncavity that could de-stabilise the laser. Light was coupled into the fibre using anti \nreflection (AR) coated lenses. The output from a 150mW, SDL 5420, non-AR coated \n810nm laser diode was coupled into the angle polished end of the fibre. A coupling \nefficiency of \u2248 40% was achieved. The optical length of the external cavity was \u2248 \n320mm. A half wave plate was used to adjust the orientation of the polarisation of light \nwith respect to the eigenmodes of the fibre. Tuning of the wavelength separation between \nthe modes was demonstrated by transversely loading the FBG [6]. This altered the \nbirefringence, via the strain-optic effect, of the fibre at the location of the FBG, altering \nthe wavelength separation of the two modes. A series of weights were used to apply a \ntransverse load to the fibre. The weights were placed on a glass slide that was positioned \n 3\non the FBG parallel to another fibre of the same type that also had its coating removed. \nApplying the load in line with the slow axis reduced the birefringence of the fibre by \ndecreasing the effective refractive index in the slow axis. The corresponding strain in the \nfast axis increases its effective refractive index thus lowering the birefringence as in [6], \nwith a concomitant decrease in the wavelength separation of the two modes.  \n \nResults: The FBG feedback was observed to reduce the laser threshold to 16mA, a \nreduction of 46%. The spectrum was observed using an Ando AQ-6310b optical \nspectrum analyser with a resolution of 0.1nm. Fig. 1 plots the relative intensity of each \nmode during rotation of the waveplate, where the laser can be seen to switch the \nwavelength and polarisation of its output. The laser operated in 3 states, in state A and C \nthe laser operated in a single longitudinal mode, orthogonally polarised for each state. In \nstate B both orthogonally linearly polarised modes co-exist, since the eigenaxes of the \nfibre are equally populated. The laser was seen to be mode hop free in all three states and \ntemperature tuning of the diode could be used to ensure the switchable modes were of \nequal intensity. No mode or intensity instabilities were seen over a period of several \nhours. The wavelength separation of the two modes was 0.3nm, which matches the \nseparation expected from a FBG written in Hi-Bi fibre with a beat length of 1.6mm at \n810nm. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the lasing wavelengths upon the transverse load \napplied to the FBG, with the orientation of the fibre and direction of transverse load also \nshown. Loads of up to 0.34 N\/mm were applied to the fibre, and a linear dependence of \nthe wavelength separation upon the load was observed. These loads can be increased to \nincrease the range over which the wavelength separation can be tuned. \n 4\nTwo FBG laser: The second laser configuration employs two spatially separated FBGs. \nThe FBGs were fabricated in single mode fibre at two different wavelengths, forcing the \nlaser to lase on two longitudinal modes. As the two FBGs were not co-located, strain \ncould be applied independently to each FBG, making both modes independently \ntuneable. The interference between these two modes can be used to create a beat signal, \nthe frequency of which is a function of the separation in wavelength of the two modes.  \nThis results in the beat frequency being tuneable across a wide range. The FBGs were \nfabricated with a physical separation of approximately 150mm such that each FBG could \nbe individually tuned. The FBGs were fabricated in hydrogen loaded fibre, Spectran (FS-\nSMC-A0780B), with the same technique as outlined earlier [5]. The Bragg wavelengths \nwere separated by 2nm, the FWHM of each FBG was \u2248 0.2nm and reflectivity was \u2248 \n25%. The end of the fibre was angle polished to prevent de-stabilising reflections. The \ncoupling efficiency was \u2248 35%. The first FBG, fabricated at 808nm, formed an external \ncavity approximately 400mm in length, the second FBG at 810nm formed a cavity \napproximately 650mm long.  \n \nResults: As an axial strain was applied to the first FBG the wavelength separation of the \ntwo longitudinal modes of the laser decreased. When the two modes are separated by less \nthan \u2248 0.3nm, mode competition effects collapsed both modes into one forming a single \nlongitudinal mode laser, (Fig. 3). The single longitudinal mode continued to dominate the \nspectrum until the FBGs were tuned to a spectral separation exceeding 0.3nm, when the \ntwo tuneable modes reappear. This 0.3nm separation generated the lowest beat frequency \nachieved of \u2248 130GHz with a corresponding synthetic wavelength of 2.3mm. The \n 5\nmaximum beat frequency was >2.28THz, which has a corresponding synthetic \nwavelength of <0.131mm. Operation was mode hop free over the entire injection current \nrange as demonstrated by Fig. 4 where a dual FBG external cavity laser is compared to \nthe same laser diode under the same conditions but with no optical feedback.  \n \nSummary: Two novel external cavity lasers have been demonstrated. Both lasers were \nshown to be mode hop free and a high degree of stability was observed over several \nhours. The Hi-Bi fibre based laser demonstrated stable operation on two orthogonally \npolarised longitudinal modes. The laser could be switched between modes by the rotation \nof a waveplate, allowing the output of the laser to be switched in both the polarisation \nand wavelength domains. Alternatively the laser could operate simultaneously on the two \nmodes. Transversely loading the fibre allowed the wavelength separation of the two \nmodes to be controlled. As the wavelength separation between switchable modes of the \nlaser is defined by the fibre birefringence it is readily calibrated, which has applications \nin multiple wavelength sensing signal processing techniques. Use of a polariser at the \noutput of the laser would allow interference between the modes and thus create a tuneable \nbeat frequency.  It also offers a new method for producing a synthetic wavelength for use, \nfor example in the signal processing of sensing systems [2]. Using an electro-optic liquid \ncrystal device to define the polarisation of the light coupled into the fibre would permit \nthe laser to be controlled electronically. \n       The second system employing spatially and spectrally separated FBGs allowed \nindependent tuning of the two longitudinal modes. The lowest beat frequency achieved \n 6\nwas \u2248 130GHz with a corresponding synthetic wavelength of 2.3mm. It is thought that \nthis frequency can be lowered significantly by the use of narrower bandwidth FBGs. \n        The methods presented here have advantages over alternative techniques such as \ndistributed feedback and distributed Bragg reflector laser diodes as they are spectrally \nstable and the emission wavelength is stable for the injection current variation. In \naddition, they are advantageous due to their significantly lower cost, in that the \ntechnology can be applied to a low cost non-AR coated laser diode. \n \nS.P. Reilly, S.W. James and R.P.
