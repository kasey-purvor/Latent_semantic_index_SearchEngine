Introduction. The normal healing response of full-thickness dermal \nexcisional wounds may be considered within the context of three continu- \n*Address correspondence to P. K. Maini. \n787 \n788 L. OLSEN et al. \nous, overlapping temporal phases, termed \u201cinflammation,\u201d \u201cproliferation\u201d \nand \u201cremodelling\u201d (Clark, 1988; Kirsner and Eaglstein, 1993). During the \nproliferative phase, wound closure is usually achieved by a combination of \nwound contraction and new tissue formation (Rudolph et al,, 1992; Skalli \nand Gabbiani, 1988), with the proportions of these contributions dependent \nupon species, age and the location, extent and geometry of the wound. \nThe complex, interregulatory cellular events whereby fibroblasts prolifer- \nate into the wound site, secrete growth factors and extracellular matrix \nproteins, differentiate into myofibroblasts and effect wound contraction are \ncollectively termed \u201cfibroplasia,\u201d a constitutive feature of the proliferative \nphase of normal healing (Clark, 1993). The underlying mechanisms of these \nprocesses are increasingly well delineated and have attracted considerable \ninvestigation, both experimental (see Clark, 1993; Jennings and Hunt, 1992; \nKirsner and Eaglstein, 1993; Mast, 1992; Rudolph et al., 1992 for thorough \nreviews) and theoretical (focusing primarily on the contractile effects of \ncell-matrix interactions during fibroplasia (Olsen et al., 1995; Tranquillo \nand Murray, 1992; Traqui et al., 1996)). \nAbnormal regulation of fibroplasia and wound contraction, however, may \nresult in one of a wide range of healing disorders (see Asmussen and \nSollner, 1993; Skalli and Gabbiani, 1988 for overviews). For example, \nexcessive dermal responses can lead to gross hypertrophic scars (in which \nthe healed wound tissue becomes elevated above the plane of the skin) or \nkeloids (in which the scar does not remain confined to the original wound \nmargins), characterized by increased levels of cellularity (fibroblasts and \nmyofibroblasts), collagen deposition and inflammatory growth factors \n(Ehrlich et al., 1994; Murray and Pinnell, 1992). In addition, active cell \ntraction generates intense mechanical stresses, especially around the scar \nperiphery, resulting in physical pain. Extensive scarring may also cause \npsychological trauma (Murray and Pinnell, 1992). \nDetailed biological insight into the mechanisms of pathogenesis, progres- \nsion, stabilization and regression of these \u201cfibro-contractive diseases\u201d is \nlacking, and existing clinical corrective methods are typically long-term, \nunpredictable, traumatic for the patient and prone to failure or recurrence. \nThese include extensive surgical excision of affected tissues, full-thickness \nskin grafting and mechanical compression (Asmussen and Siillner, 1993; \nBoykin and Molnar, 1992; Murray and Pinnell, 1992; Rudolph et al., 1992). \nPhenomenologically, fibro-contractive diseases commonly exhibit in- \ncreased fibroplastic and retractile tissue responses in which myofibroblasts \nare ubiquitous cellular components (Gabbiani, 1992; Skalli and Gabbiani, \n19881, but otherwise, the features of these pathologies are highly diverse \n(Murray, 1993; Skalli et al., 1989). Excessive disorganized extracellular \nmatrix deposition (notably fibrillar collagen) and continual inflammatory \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 789 \nresponses are also characteristic of many fibro-contractive diseases (Ehrlich \net al., 1994; Murray, 1993). Most of these pathologies stabilize with time, \nand some even partially or completely regress, but the determinants of this \nbehaviour are unknown (Asmussen and Sollner, 1993; Murray and Pinnell, \n1992). \nSome fibro-contractive conditions arise from inflammatory settings, such \nas wound healing and soft tissue remodelling; these include severe burn \nscar contractures (with similar consequences to Dupuytren\u2019s disease), hy- \npertrophic scar, keloids, liver cirrhosis, kidney and liver fibroses, regenerat- \ning tendon, cataract and fibrotic capsules surrounding tissue implants \n(Boykin and Mollnar, 1992; Ehrlich et al., 1994; Murray and Pinnell, 1992; \nSchiirch et al., 1990; Skalli and Gabbiani, 1988). Others, known as fibro- \nmatoses, are non-inflammatory, non-invasive (myo-Nbroplastic lesions; an \nexample is the well-documented Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, a permanent \ncondition affecting the upper palmar skin which consists of actively contrac- \ntile cellular nodules and fibrous connective tissue cords (Flint, 1990; \nRudolph and Vande Berg, 1991; Schiirch et al., 1990), resulting in severe \ndiscomfort and loss of function of the affected hand. There are other \nproliferative tissue disorders with important similarities which do not arise \nfrom physical injury; an important class is those believed to be neoplastic \nresponses, characterized by vigorous myofibroblastic proliferations in the \nstroma of invasive carcinomas (Skalli and Gabbiani, 1988). \nIn this paper, we focus on the inflammatory growth-factor-mediated \nfibro-proliferative responses associated with wound healing disorders. These \nare investigated within the framework of a mathematical model recently \nproposed for fibroplasia and wound contraction (Olsen et al., 1995) with the \naim of an improved understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of such \nconditions and their relationships to normal healing. \n2. Mathematical Modelling. \n2.1. The fill model framework. We have recently proposed a continuum \nmodel for fibroplasia and wound contraction in adult mammalian dermis \n(Olsen et al., 1995). This \u201cfull\u201d model is briefly summarized here since it \nwill be used to investigate abnormal healing. It is based upon the following \nfundamental processes operating within the proliferative phase of healing \n(see also Olsen et al., 1995 and references therein for the biological basis of \nthe model): \nFibroblasts. During wound healing, fibroblasts are actively motile, ex- \nhibiting both random and directed migration. These fluxes are modelled as \n790 L. OLSEN et al. \nunbiased Brownian motion for the former and as a chemotactic response to \ngradients in the growth-factor profiles for the latter. Fibroblasts are also \npassively convected by the strained tissue in which they reside. \nNew cells are generated by mitosis, modelled by the logistic growth \nfunction, with the mitotic rate substantially enhanced by the growth factors \n(which are cell cycle competence and progression factors). \u201cNatural\u201d cell \nsenescence is described by simple linear decay. Finally, there are transfor- \nmations between the two fibroblastic cell phenotypes. Within a dermal \nwound, a proportion of the fibroblasts undergo a reversible phenotypic \nchange into contractile cells known as myofibroblasts. We model this \ntransition by reversible kinetics, mediated by the growth-factor profile. \nIn addition, fibroblasts metabolize and secrete active growth factors, \nsynthesize and degrade fibrillar extracellular matrix components (mediated \nby growth factors) and generate local traction stress within the tissue. \nMyojibroblasts. These cells are not actively motile, but like fibroblasts, \nundergo passive convection by the moving tissue. \nCell proliferation and death are modelled as for the fibroblasts and the \nphenotypic transformations are the same, but with reversed signs. Note that \nthe linear growth rate of myofibroblasts is lower than that for fibroblasts \n(Vande Berg et al., 1989) and that the death rate is increased due to \n\u201cprogrammed\u201d cell death, or \u201capoptosis\u201d (Gabbiani, 1992). \nMyofibroblasts also metabolize and secrete growth factors and synthesize \nand degrade extracellular matrix, possibly at a different rate to fibroblasts. \nTheir roles in mediating fibroblast-generated traction forces are assumed to \nbe transmission and amplification of these stresses within the extracellular \nmatrix. \nGrowth factors. Many different families of inflammatory growth factors \nare known to regulate fibroplasia, but we consider a single, generic chemi- \ncal (for simplicity) whose properties simulate the combined roles of in vivo \npromoters of healing such as platelet-derived growth factor and transform- \ning growth factor p. \nThe chemical may diffuse through the tissue (again, modelled by Brown- \nian motion) and is carried by passive convection. It is produced and \nmetabolized by both cell types and undergoes tissue removal\/inactivation, \nmodelled as simple linear decay. \nExtraceZluZur matrix. Again, a wide variety of extracellular matrix compo- \nnents are involved in dermal wound healing, but we include only (fibrillar) \ntype I collagen because of its central roles in fibroplasia and contraction. \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 791 \nThe only flux of the fibrillar collagen network is due to passive convec- \ntion. It is synthesized (with growth-factor mediation and inhibition by high \ncollagen concentrations) and degraded via specific enzymes by both cell \ntypes. The extracellular matrix also provides the support for cell-derived \ntraction stresses and intrinsic tissue stresses. \n2.2. Governing equations, boundary and initial conditions. With some \nfurther detail on the mathematical representations of these processes \n(Olsen et al., 1995) the non-dimensional model equations are derived from \nconservation laws for the fibroblast density n(x, t), myofibroblast density \n111(x, t), chemical concentration c(x, t) and collagen concentration p(x, t), \nwhere x is the spatial position vector and t denotes time. \nFor simplicity, we consider a linear (or \u201cslash\u201d) wound. Assuming the \nmodel variables to be independent of wound depth, this requires only a \nsingle spatial coordinate, x say, in the plane of the skin. In this case the \nmodel equations are \nKlC \n--n+K,m- 6n , \nc+c \n(1) - \nphenotypic \nconversion \ndeath \nKlC \n+ -n - K2m - h6m , \nc+c - \ndeath \nphenotypic \nconversion \n(2) \ndiffusion and convection production by cells \ndc d K,(n + fmk \ndecay \n-=- \ndt dx Yc + c \n(3) \nconvection synthesis and degradation by cells \n192 L. OLSEN et al. \nHere, all parameters are positive, and typical values are given in the legend \nto Fig. 1. Note the fibroblast\/myofibroblast phenotypic conversions, given \nby reversible dynamics in equations (1) and (2), with chemical mediation of \nthe myofibroblastic differentiation. Note also that the chemical production \nterm in equation (3) has a maximal rate related to the parameter K,. \nAll of the above processes which involve chemical mediation are mod- \nelled by the monotonically increasing and saturating Michaelis-Menten \ndynamics. This functional form is intuitively sensible, but is also derived \nfrom a theoretical analysis of cell-surface receptor binding dynamics in \nfibroblastic cell-growth-factor interactions (Olsen et al., 1995; Raines et al.; \nSherratt et al., 1993). \nIn reality, unbiased cell movement may also depend upon the local \ngrowth-factor concentration (a phenomenon termed \u201cchemokinesis\u201d): this \nmay be modelled by setting 0, = D,(c), but does not yield qualitative \nresults different from those presented in this paper. Previous models of \nepidermal wound closure have shown chemokinesis to be an unimportant \neffect (see Dale et al., 1994, for example), and so we neglect this detail \nhere. \nA conservation law for the tissue momentum, together with simplifying \nassumptions that the tissue is a viscoelastic deformable continuum with a \nlinear constitutive relation and negligible inertia, yields the fifth model \nequation governing tissue displacement, u(x, t). In the one-dimensional \nlinear geometry, this is \nThe first two terms on the left-hand side of equation (5) arise from the \nviscous and elastic contributions to the intrinsic tissue stress tensor. The \nthird term models the active cell traction stress, which is proportional to \ncell density and inversely proportional to the collagen concentration (for \nsufficiently large p), in agreement with theoretical and experimental con- \nsiderations (Bell et al., 1979; Murray et al., 1988). Fibroblasts are assumed \nto generate the traction stresses, whereas myofibroblasts transmit and \namplify these stresses within the extracellular matrix. The term on the \nright-hand side of (5) represents the (linear) restoring force which resists \ndermal tissue motion, which is assumed to be proportional to the displace- \nment u per unit collagen concentration. The parameter s thus accounts for \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 793 \ndermal tethering-it assumes lower values for loose-skinned mammals \n(such as rats and rabbits) and higher values for tight-skinned mammals \n(such as pigs and humans). \nThe wound centre is at x = 0 with the initial wound margin given by \nx = 1. By symmetry, these equations may be solved over the semi-infinite \ndomain 0 IX, t < ~0 with symmetric boundary conditions at x = 0 and \nq = (n, m, c, p, u) --, q, = (n,,,O, 0, po, 0) as x + ~0. Throughout this paper, q \ndenotes the vector of model variables. \nThe vector q. is a uniform steady state representative of normal dermis \nin which the myofibroblast and generic growth-factor levels are zero. By the \nscalings used in the non-dimensionalization process, ~~ and p0 are set to \nunity (Olsen et al., 1995). The initial wound state, qinit(X) = \n(ninit,O, Cinit, Pinit, 0) is a large perturbation of the dermal state qO. Specifi- \ncally, the initial conditions corresponding to a dermal excisional wound are \nas given in the following list: \nFibroblasts: None inside the wound and unwounded dermal levels out- \nside, so ni,it(x> = H(x - l), where H(e) is the Heaviside step \nfunction. \nChemical: Active growth-factor profile centred around the wound site \ndue to the early inflammatory response following injury. Specifi- \ncally, we use the function Cinit(X) = ci exp( -x2), which has an \nappropriate qualitative form. \nCollagen: Low-level matrix deposition inside the wound during the early \ninflammatory phase and unwounded dermal concentration out- \nside, giving Pinit( X> = pi + (1 - p,)H( x - 1). \nThe non-dimensional model parameter value estimates, sensitivity analy- \nses and biological interpretations are detailed in Olsen et al. (1995), but \nsome key parameters are highlighted as required in this paper. \n2.3. Pathological steady states. Under normal conditions q, is a locally \nstable steady state and the initial wound state evolves back to q,,, thus \nsimulating fibroplasia and contraction over a time scale of about 30 days, \nwhich is characteristic of the proliferative phase of healing.

Analysis of a Caricature Model. The model has been shown to exhibit \nsteady solutions reminiscent of healing pathologies. Biologically, it is crucial \nto determine the key parameters which regulate the transformation be- \ntween normal and abnormal healing. Equations (6)~(8) are not explicitly \nsolvable, however, so to gain further insight into the steady states of (l)-(5) \nand the dynamics of pathological and normal healing responses we propose \na caricature model which mimics the essential features of the full system. \n7% L. OLSEN et al. \n3.1. Derivation of the caricature model. Explicitly, we consider a compos- \nite cell density n(x, t) representing both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and \na generic chemical concentration c(x, t) with similar properties to those \ndescribed in section 2.1: \nCells. Since the tissue biomechanics have been omitted, passive convec- \ntion is neglected and the cell flux is due to random migration and chemo- \ntaxis. The cell proliferation and loss terms are the same as in the full \nmodel, but there are no phenotypic conversions because of the assumption \nof fibroblastic homogeneity. \nChemical. Diffusion is the only contribution to the chemical flux, as \nthere is no convection. The cells produce the chemical, with the same \nmetabolic dependence on chemical concentration as in the full model, and \nthere is also tissue removal\/inactivation. \nAs in the full model, chemical mediation of cell chemotaxis, proliferation \nand production of the chemical obeys the Michaelis-Menten uptake form \nbased on the dynamics of growth factors and their cell-surface receptors. \nThe equations. The above processes capture the fundamental fibroblas- \ntic cellular functions and their coupling to the growth-factor dynamics of \nthe full model as in equations (l)-(3), giving the caricature system \ncell movement \nmitosis \n+:(I+$-) \ndeath \nn(1 - yn) - Sn - =f(n,c), (9) \ndiffusion \ndecay \nF =g(n,c). (10) \nAs in section 2.2, the boundary conditions are zero species gradients at \nx = 0 by symmetry and q = (n, c) + q,, = (n,,O> as x --) ~0. Again, q. is \ninterpreted as the normal dermal steady state and no = [l - 6\/a l\/y is set \nto unity. The initial wound state is given by ginit = (H(x - 11, Cinit(X)), \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 191 \nobtained by analogous arguments for the initial cellular and chemical \nprofiles as in the full model. \n3.2. Existence and stability of steady states. Uniform steady states q* of \n(9) and (10) are the solutions of f(n, c) = 0 = g(n, c). These, together with \nthe parameter inequalities which determine their existence (equivalent to \nnon-negative values for the species variables) and stability, can be deduced \nanalytically: \nTrivial: qt = (O,O>. With no cells or growth factors, this steady state is \nexpected intuitively and may be representative of a chronic non-healing \nwound scenario; however, it is of little relevance to excessive healing \npathologies, the focus of this paper. The steady state exists for all parame- \nter values and is locally stable if and only if u < 6. \nDermal: q0 = (n,, 0). Here there are fibroblasts, but no active growth \nfactors. This dermal, or unwounded, steady state exists if and only if 6 < (T, \nso this constraint must be satisfied by realistic parameter values. q, is \nlocally stable if and only if 6 < cr and K,TQ < \u2018y, 8,. \nPathological: q,, = (n,, cJ. Steady states with q > 0 are not quite as \nsimple: cP is given by real, positive roots of p(c P = a2c2 + a,c + a0 = 0, \nwhere a2 = (1 +A)&, a, = (1 +&(~,6, - K,IZ~) +AK,(~, - 7-l) + SS, and \na, = B(y, 8, - K,Tz~). Also, g = 0 implies np = S,(y, + cp)\/~,. The necessary \nand sufficient condition for one such steady state is a, < 0 and those for \ntwo pathological steady states (q *, say, where q+ > q_> are a, > 0, a, < 0 \nand a; - 4a,a, > 0. Otherwise, there are no such solutions. \nLinear stability analysis together with the signs of f and g in the \n(n, c) 2 (0,O) quadrant of phase space show that when only one pathologi- \ncal steady state exists, it is a stable node and q,, is a saddle point. If both \nq + exist, however, then q_ is a saddle point and both q, and q+ are stable \nnodes. The regions of attractions of q. and q+ are delineated by the \nseparatrix, II = S(c) say, which is also the stable manifold through q_. S(c) \nis confined to the positive quadrant and is a monotonic decreasing function. \nThese results are summarised qualitatively in Fig. 3. \n3.3. Key parameters and bifurcations. The values of parameters in the \ninequality K,no < y,S, (except no, which is set to unity) are crucial in \ndetermining the outcome of the healing response. Note that the intercept \nof the g = 0 null cline on the n-axis is yC&\/~,nO (Fig. 3). As K, is \n798 L.

In (a), the dermal steady state \nq,, is globally stable. In (b), q0 and the pathological steady state q+ are locally \nstable whereas the pathological steady state q_ is unstable-the attracting \nregions of q, and q+ are separated by the stable manifold through the saddle \npoint at q_. In (cl, q+ is globally stable. \nsequentially increased (or as \u2018yC or 8, is decreased) whilst fixing the other \nparameter values, the dynamics exhibit two important bifurcations. This is \nqualitatively evident from Fig. 3, but also from the steady state equations \nf( n, c) = 0 = g( n, c) and their linear stability analyses. \nWe focus on the parameter K, for the remainder of this paper. This \nparameter represents the maximal rate of active growth-factor production \nby fibroblastic cells, since this is a potentially manipulable biological param- \neter. Much of the following analysis, however, could be pursued for either \nSC, the rate of active growth-factor removal from the tissue, or yC, the active \ngrowth-factor concentration which elicits half-maximal binding of cell- \nsurface receptors to their growth-factor ligands. \n(i) Saddle-node bifurcation at K, = K$). K(~) is calculated from the \nequation a: - 4a,a, = 0 under the constraintsC a, > 0 and a, < 0 (section \n3.2).

The qualitative dynamics of the system can be subdivided \ninto three intervals: I,,, = (0, K:\u2018)), Ibist = ( K!~), K:~)) and Ipath = (KC(~), w). \nIf K, E &,,, then the dynamics represent normal wound healing, for any \ninitial conditions (see also Fig. 3(a)). If K, E Ipath, then a pathological \ntransition will occur-again, given any initial data (see also Fig. 3(c)). The \nbistable regime, K, E Ibist , however, exhibits richer behaviour (see also Fig. \n3(b)). Here, the initial conditions and other parameter values strongly \ninfluence the dynamics of the system (9) and (10). The dependence on \ninitial profiles is crucial and means that some wound conditions may trigger \na pathological response while others do not. \nThe bistability in this system (for K, E Ibist, see Fig. 4) has important \nconsequences. Suppose that K, E Ibist and that normal healing dynamics are \nin progress. If a forced perturbation to the system causes (n,c) to move \nfrom the attracting region for q. to that for q,, then there will be a \npathological outcome unless another parameter, such as K,, is also changed. \nSimilarly, if a forced perturbation increases K, above K:~), then K, must be \nlowered below K,(~) to ensure normal healing. Biologically, these predictions \nsuggest various therapeutic strategies, as discussed later. \n3.4. Spatiotemporal development of pathological states. The spatial na- \nture of normal and pathological healing dynamics is of great interest. First, \nnormal healing is simulated by solving equations (9) and (10) with boundary \nand initial conditions as in section 3.2. Typical results are shown in Fig. 5, \nin which K, E Ibist and the initial data lie entirely within the attracting \nL. OLSEN et al. \nCells Chemical \n1 \nX X \nFigure 5.

See also Fig. \n1. Parameter values are D, = 0.02, a = 0.05, p = 0.2, u= 0.02, A = 44.5, 8 = 1, \ny= 0.01, 6 = 0.0198, DC = 0.2, K, = 0.1, -yC = 1, 8, = 0.5, and ci = 1.

This simulation corresponds to a severe healing pathology, \ncharacterised by grossly excessive cellular and chemical levels which propagate \nfrom near the orieinal wound margin. See also Fig. 2. \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 801 \nfibro-proliferative pathology (section 11. Wave-like solutions appear to \nevolve from a point near the initial wound boundary, x = 1, resulting in \nhighly elevated cell and chemical levels which not only invade the wound \nspace, but also spread into previously unaffected tissue over a time scale of \ndays. \nPathological responses arising from K, E Ibist (as discussed above) exhibit \nsimilar spatiotemporal behaviour to that illustrated in Fig. 6 (not shown). \nFrom the form of equations (9) and (10) and the numerical simulations of \nthe pathological response, it appears that travelling wave solutions (that is, \nwith constant wave velocity and wave profiles) develop from the initial \nconditions. Such solutions have the form n(x, t> = N(z) and c(x, t) = C(z), \nwhere z =x - at and a is the wave velocity. Substituting into (9) and (10) \ngives a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. \nThe supposition that travelling wave solutions effect a transition from the \ndermal steady state Q. to the pathological steady state Q, is true if and \nonly if there exists a phase trajectory, Y say, between Q. and Q, in \nQ=(N,C,U,V) space, where U = dN\/dz and V= dC\/dz (see Murray, \n1989, for several examples of travelling wave analyses). Further, Fig. 6 \nshows that Q + Q. as z + m and that Q + Q, as z + -to. Thus, necessary \nconditions for Y to exist are a stable local manifold at Q,, and an unstable \nlocal manifold at Q,. \nLocal stability analyses of the system in Q-space at Q. and Q, reveal \nthat for K, E Ipath, these conditions are satisfied. The further requirement \nthat Y must lie entirely in the subspace (N, C) 2 (O,O> imposes a lower \nbound on a in terms of the model parameters: \nFor K, E Ibist, the above conditions are again satisfied, but no minimum \nwave velocity is stipulated in this case. \nIn summary, travelling wave solutions of (9) and (10) may drive the \nsystem to the stable pathological steady state if and only if K, > KAY), and \nthat this state invades neighbouring tissue with a minimum wave velocity of \na if K > K!~). It can be shown that if either cell chemotaxis or random m,n \nmigration is neglected, by setting (Y or 0, to zero, respectively, in (91, then \nthe basic methods and results of the travelling wave analysis as outlined \nabove are unaffected. \nWhether active extracellular growth factors are freely diffusible through \ntissue is unclear-the availability of active growth factors in viva may be \nmediated by ligand binding to fixed sites within the fibrillar extracellular \n802 L. OLSEN et al. \nmatrix scaffold (Clark, 1991). This scenario is modelled by setting 0, to \nzero in equation (10). A similar analysis to that above predicts that \ntravelling wave solutions may exist for any K, > K:\u2018), but no minimum wave \nvelocity is imposed. In this case, numerical simulations reveal that patholog- \nical waves do form (as for the case 0, > 0) and that this depends on the \ninitial conditions when K, E Ibist. \n3.5. Cessation and regression. Having investigated the initiation and \nprogression of pathological responses in relation to normal healing dynam- \nics, two important clinical problems remain. First, how do invasive patho- \nlogical dynamics become spatially limited? Fibro-proliferative pathologies \nrarely proceed far beyond the original wound boundaries, except in exces- \nsive dermal scars such as keloids (Asmussen and Siillner, 1993; Murray, \n19931, whereas the model predicts that a pathological wave will advance \n(with constant speed) throughout the skin. Second, what mechanisms might \ncause a fibro-proliferative disorder to partially or fully regress? The clinical \noccurrence, extent and permanence of regression is unpredictable and \nunexplained (McCann et al., 1993; Murray and Pinnell, 1992). These issues \nare addressed below. \n(i) Cessation. The phenomenon of a wave-like progression of a patho- \nlogical state (Fig. 6) followed by a cessation of the wave resulting in a \nstable, spatially bounded disease would correspond to a stable spatially \ninhomogeneous steady state solution of equations (9) and (10). Such a \nsolution is only possible if some model parameters are spatially inhomoge- \nneous such that q+ is locally stable near x = 0 and unstable for large X. \nFocusing again on K=, this implies that K, E I,,,, for large X, and Fig. 7 \nillustrates the solution of the caricature model with such a spatially vary- \ning K,. \nFigure 7 confirms that the pathological travelling wave is halted approxi- \nmately at the point n =xb where K, falls below K$), although there is \nsubstantial \u201covershoot,\u201d most notably in cellular levels, due to the chemical \ndiffusive flux which effectively modulates the sharp transition of K, through \nits bifurcation value. This is confirmed by setting 0, to zero and repeating \nthe simulations. In this case, the wave stops abruptly at xb with no \novershoot (not shown). \nNote that if K,(X) E Ipath for 0 IX Ix, but K,(X) E Ibist for X > xb9 then \nthe pathological wave velocity and profiles will become modulated at xb but \ncessation does not occur because q+ remains locally stable. \nThe implications of the above results are discussed in section 5. \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 803 \n120 \n40 \n20 \nI- \nF \nCells Chemical \n2 4 6 6 I \n+ \n2 4 6 6 \nx x \nFigure 7. Numerical solution of the caricature model as in Fig. 6, but with \nK,(X) = 0.6 if 0 IX I 4 and K,(X) = 0 if x > 4. The solid curves are the steady \nstate profiles (calculated at 150 days). Note that the spatial extent of the \npathology extends beyond the value xb = 4 (see text). \n(ii) Regression. A related problem concerns the generally variable re- \ngression of some fibro-proliferative disorders. In the context of the carica- \nture model, such behaviour is represented by pathological dynamics toward \nq+ from the initial conditions, followed in time by wave cessation and a \ngradual return toward q. throughout the domain. \nWhereas cessation is an inherently spatial problem, regression is essen- \ntially a temporal anti-pathogenic phenomenon. Such a mechanism could \ninvolve time-dependent model parameter values-a reduction in K,, for \nexample. By analogy with the above arguments for cessation, regression is \npossible if I, E I,,,,, for all t > t,, where t, is a characteristic regression \ntime of the disease. This would imply that q, loses stability to q, at time t,, \ninitiating a transition back toward the normal dermal state. Results for a \nsimple switch K,(t) = 1.2~~ (\u2018) for 0 I t I t, and K,(t) = 0 for t > t, are \nshown in Fig. 8. \nAfter time t,, the regression in the chemical concentration is rapid, \nwithin a few days, whereas ceil levels diminish much more gradually, over a \ntime scale of years toward their dermal levels (Fig. 8), as is typical of keloid \nand hypertrophic scar regression (Murray and Pinnell, 1992). Note that the \npathological response response progresses some distance beyond the point \nat which the temporal switch occurs and that the regression dynamics are \nmonotonic rather than wave-like: these features are particularly evident \nfrom the cell profiles in Fig. 8. Again, overshoot does not occur for the case \n0, = 0 (not shown), and reducing K, into the interval Ibist only serves to \nmodulate the advancing pathology rather than inducing regression. \n804 L.

For example, synergy between \ndifferent types of growth factors (which are activated during wound healing) \ncan cause one such chemical to up-regulate cellular production of another \n(Clark, 1991; Martin et al., 1992; Sprugel et al., 1987), perhaps by increasing \ncell-surface receptor expression or by promoting intracellular messenger \nsignals involved in growth-factor-mediated biosynthesis. \n4. Discussion. In this work, we have addressed some clinically important \nissues regarding fibro-proliferative disorders of dermal wound healing (out- \nlined in section 1) by application of a previously proposed deterministic \nmathematical model for fibroplasia and wound contraction (Olsen et al., \n1995) (section 2). A simpler, caricature model was developed to investigate \na range of fibro-proliferative healing disorders characterized by excessive \nfibroblastic cell and inflammatory growth-factor profiles (sections 2.3 and \n3.1). Qualitative and quantitative insight was obtained into the pathogene- \nsis, progression, stability, cessation and regression of pathological states in \nrelation to normal healing, highlighting the roles of key model processes \nand parameters (sections 3.2-3.5). \nThe dynamics g(n, c) of the inflammatory growth-factor mediators are \ncrucial to the behaviour of the model system given by equations (9) and (10) \nand, particularly, the balance between cellular production of the active \nchemical and chemical removal from the tissue is pivotal; the former is \ncontrolled by the parameter K,. Pathogenesis to a disease state is guaran- \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 805 \nteed if K, > Ki2) and is possible, depending on the initial perturbation to \nthe nOrma dermal state, if K, > K, . (l) This is clear from the phase plane, \nlinear stability and bifurcation analyses of sections 3.2 and 3.3 (see also \nFigs. 3 and 4). Transitions to pathological states are proposed to occur via \ntravelling waves: one moving into the wound space (the \u201chealing\u201d wave) \nand another moving away from the wound (the \u201cpathological\u201d wave) into \nnormal skin (Fig. 6, section 3.4). If K, > ~2~) and 0, > 0, then the pathologi- \ncal wave has a minimum speed which we have calculated analytically. \nThe resulting pathology can become spatially bounded if K, varies \nappropriately with distance, X, from the wound centre (section 3.5). Figure \n7 illustrates this phenomenon, showing considerable \u201covershoot\u201d of the \npathological response. Similarly, gradual regression of the disease may \noccur if K, varies appropriately with time t (section 3.5), as demonstrated \nin Fig. 8. The difference between keloid and hypertrophic scarring-namely, \nthat the latter condition generally remains confined within the original \nwound boundaries-is manifest in the spatial extent of the pathology, \nwhich in this model is determined by the form of K,(x, t) and by other \nparameter values (the chemical diffusion coefficient 0, influences the \ndegree of the overshoot effect, for example). \nThe prescribed non-autonomous forms for K&X, t) (section 3.5) crudely \naccount for processes involved in wound healing that have not been \nexplicitly included in this model. Although K,(x, t) may, in principle, be \nderived from an appropriate conservation-type equation, the additional \ncomplexity would question this approach within our \u201ccaricature\u201d frame- \nwork. \nThe effects of spatiotemporal changes in K, may be understood by \nreference to the bifurcation diagram (Fig. 4). The bistability exhibited by \nthe system for K;l) < K, < Kz2) is a crucial property of the model and has \npotentially important implications. For example, suppose that the dynamics \nlie on the stable branch q,. If K, is increased beyond ~c(~), then the \ndynamics move to the stable \u201cpathological\u201d branch q,. However, a thera- \npeutic (or natural) reduction in K, below ~2~) is insufficient: K, must fall \nbelow K(~) for the pathology to be successfully treated. Therapeutic and \ncorrecti;e strategies in combating fibro-proliferative disorders could benefit \nfrom new insights gained from these theoretical results. \nWe propose that adult human dermis of individuals has an effective K, \nbelow ~c(~) with the consequence that the dermal state is stable so that \nnormal healing dynamics are initiated upon wounding (Fig. 5). This permits \nthe scenario that K, > K~I), however, in which case, certain wound condi- \ntions and trauma-induced local perturbations may trigger a pathological \nresponse (section 3.3). Such a hypothesis suggests mechanisms for the \napparent differential incidences of fibro-proliferative disorders between \n806 L.

The hypothesis may \nalso explain the well known but inadequately understood observation that \nhypertrophic scarring occurs more frequently in full-thickness bums wounds \nthan in excisional wounds (Asmussen and Siillner, 1993; Boykin and \nMolnar, 1992; Murray and Pinnell, 1992). The heightened inflammatory cell \ninflux early in the healing of bum wounds may serve to increase the initial \nsupply of active growth factors, thus triggering the excessive healing re- \nsponse. Pathogenic stimuli could also be related to cellular signals that \neither effectively enhance K~, perhaps by up-regulating ligand receptor \nexpression in fibroblastic cells, or that deplete growth-factor inactivation \nsites in the extracellular milieu (Clark, 1991). There are also other possibili- \nties, such as excessive supplies of activated growth factors or activation \nsignals, or up-regulated binding protein levels which effectively prolong the \nefficacy of polypeptide growth factors in uivo (Bowen-Pope et aE., 1984; \nRaines et al., 1990; Sprugel et al., 1987). These scenarios are all potentially \ntestable, with the model predictions of section 3 borne in mind. \nOne important outstanding question concerns whether the caricature \nmodel (9) and (10) is an adequate representation of the full model system \n(l)-(5) with respect to the behaviour studied in section 3. Numerical \nsimulations suggest that this is indeed the case. The full model can be \nshown to exhibit a steady state structure similar to that for the caricature \nmodel, as alluded to in sections 2.3-3.2. The advantage of the caricature \nmodel is that it can be studied analytically; in the full model we must rely \non numerical solutions alone. The full model elicits the same qualitative \nphenomena of pathogenesis, wave-like progression, cessation and regres- \nsion as the caricature model, but also yields insight into the extracellular \nmatrix involvement in these diseases. Specifically, excessive collagen accu- \nmulation occurs in the pathological response-which is expected from \nequation (4)-and intense mechanical forces (\u201ccontractures\u201d) are gener- \nated, particularly at the leading front of the disease (not shown). These \nbiological features are typical of fibro-proliferative disorders (Boykin and \nMolnar, 1992; Flint, 1990; Murray, 1993; Rudolph et al., 1992; Skalli and \nGabbiani, 1988). \nThe fundamental conclusion of this work is that with an understanding of \nthe spatiotemporal dynamics of fibro-proliferative disorders, we may sug- \ngest mechanisms by which these pathologies arise, develop, stabilize and \nregress, and propose strategies for new clinical approaches in managing \nthese diseases-all of which are potentially testable in experiments. \nLO expresses gratitude to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil of Great Britain for a Research Studentship award to support this \nMODEL FOR WOUND HEALING DISORDERS 807 \nwork.
