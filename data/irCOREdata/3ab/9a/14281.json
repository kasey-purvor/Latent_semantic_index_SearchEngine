National and commercial education systems are\nstruggling, as increasing numbers of people must be trained within harsh budget constraints. In\nthis context, internet technology has emerged as a new tool in the field of education and\ntraining, and the number of applications of this technology is increasing steadily. In order to\nassess its full potential, it is important to study cases in both educational and business settings.\nThe foremost advantage of internet technology is ease of distribution. Once a Web-site is\nlaunched, the material can be accessed by an audience of any size without dramatic cost\n54\nAn-] Vb\/ume 7 Number I\nincreases, as no physical objects need be distributed. Another advantage is ease of maintenance.\nChanges in online material take effect instantly, compared with the much longer revision cycles\nof, say, printed material. Online material can thus be kept up-to-date with reasonably little\neffort. A third advantage is ease of use, as the Web interface is familiar to an increasingly large\nnumber of people, both at home and in the working environment Convenience is also an\nadvantage. Students are no longer constrained in time or space. They can study at a time and\nplace of their own choice, as long as a computer and the network are available.\nHowever, online learning also has some disadvantages. Firstly, technology evolves very rapidly,\nmaking it difficult to create long-term, stable and flexible applications. Secondly, it is difficult\nto cater for students' different learning styles. Online material must be carefully structured, in\norder to offer the advantage of non-linearity without creating confusion. Studies show that\ninformation structure has significant influence on learning performance (Quentin-Baxter, 1998;\nPaolucci, 1998). Thirdly, an increased burden of responsibility is placed on the students. They\noften have to study individually, without motivational support from fellow students, and with\ndelayed support and feedback.\nDespite these disadvantages, Web-based learning may still be the answer to the increased\neducational needs of today. Technology is still in its infancy, and further research and develop-\nment will most likely lead to better results. The purpose of this paper is to describe the\nexperiences from a multimedia staff education programme on the intranet of the Swedish tele-\ncommunications corporation Telia, and to discuss some factors that have been found important.\nTelia Corporation\nThe Swedish telecommunications corporation Telia has approximately 26,000 employees. Their\nmission statement is to 'enhance the quality of life, the environment and the competitive ability\nof individuals and organizations by bringing them together with easy-to-use telecom-based\ninformation services' (Telia, 1998a). Telia's ambitious environmental programme has been in\nprogress for many years. Apart from aiming at running its own business in an environmentally\nfriendly way through the choice of materials and procedures, Telia's ambition is to 'help its\ncustomers adapt their operations to environmental demands and demonstrate the environmental\nadvantages of telecommunications' (Telia, 1998b).\nIn the light of this policy, Telia decided to develop an educational programme for all employees.\nThe goal of the programme is to increase awareness of the company's environmental policy,\nand of the environmental benefits of telecommunication services, hoping to motivate the staff\nboth at work and at home. For instance, using phones, email, electronic commerce and digital\ndocuments can reduce transport and thus pollution. The decision was made to deploy the\neducation programme on Telia's intranet, in order to illustrate these benefits, and also to use and\nevaluate the latest technology available.\nThe education programme\nThe education programme consists of two parts: (i) the multimedia material on the intranet,\nwhich each employee goes through individually, and (ii) a subsequent traditional seminar, led\nby an expert on environmental issues. The seminar is meant to offer employees an opportunity\nto discuss issues with one another, ask questions and share ideas. A comprehensive description\nof the programme can be found in Ionesco (1998).\n55\nVlod tonesco Staff edutainment on a corporate intranet - lessons learned\nThe online material contains a large amount of facts and figures about the environment, related\nboth to the company's business activities and to individual behaviour at work and home. The\naim is to highlight the environmental benefits of telecommunications products and services, to\narouse a sense of involvement in the employees and, in the long run, to create new business\nopportunities. In order to attract and retain the users' interest it was decided to give the website\nan informative, and yet entertaining profile. The decision was made to create an 'edutainment\nsite', in which educational objectives can be realized in an entertaining manner.\nSeveral of the technologies available on the Web today have been used to present the\ninformation. Frames, simple HTML and JavaScript code, a mixture of GIF and JPEG images,\nShockwave and Flash animations, streamed RealMedia audio and video files, all contribute to a\nrich and varied design. Further, a number of CGI-scripts are used for the navigation system, and\nto create games, polls, quizzes and tests.\nTo facilitate navigation within the online material, the information has been divided into\nmodules. The metaphor underlying the top level of the information structure is that of a city,\nwith different areas and buildings, each linked to a module with a specific topic. All the\nmodules have a similar tree structure, with a summary describing the module, a main scene\n(possibly made up from a chain of Web pages) conveying the message, a list of internal links to\nrelevant products and services, and a list of external links to successful implementations of the\nmodule topic. The current position in the information structure is always indicated on the Web\nand a short cut to the top level of the module is always present A menu with short cuts to all the\nmodules is located on the side of the screen, and it also indicates which modules have been\nvisited by the user. This, of course, requires users to register the first time they enter the site,\nand then to log in for every new session. The individual progress of each user is saved on the\nserver, enabling access from any computer on the network.\nThe site contains a glossary covering most of the terminology used on the site. Links to\nindividual entries are abundant throughout the material, but the glossary can also be used as a\nseparate module for browsing through all the entries. Some entries are only short descriptions,\nwhile others consist of longer articles and images. A proposal box on the site provides everyone\nwith the opportunity to submit comments and suggestions to the educators and to the staff\nresponsible for the environmental programme.\nImplementation\nSome implementation issues will be briefly discussed here. For a more detailed discussion, see\nJonsson(1998).\nThe production process was initiated by the environmental department at Telia. Business and\nlearning goals were carefully defined and a specification was written. A virtual organization\nspanning over several smaller firms and consultants was formed, as no single company was\nfound to have all the expertise required. The project team consisted of managers, environmental\nexperts, content creators, Web designers, artists, audio and video experts, and programmers.\nManaging and co-ordinating a project team of such diversity can be a challenge. The\nterminology used by the different professionals differs, and insight into the practical limitations\nof others' domains is sometimes insufficient. It is of little use, for instance, when the design\nteam thinks of a fanciful animation, if it cannot be implemented by the programming team.\n56\nAa-J Volume 7 Number I\nAfter a few such failures, co-operation was improved by enforcing a feedback mechanism, as\nwell as detailed sub-goals, schedules and deadlines for all involved. Form and content were\ngiven equal importance, taking cost, time and effort into consideration.\nThe information content was structured and subdivided into modules, and scripts were written\nfor each module. Based on the script and on practical technical and economic considerations,\ndifferent types of multimedia objects were developed for each module. A user-friendly interface\nwas outlined and tested in co-operation with a sample of representative users. Templates were\ndeveloped to simplify the coding stage and to ensure consistency. As the project proceeded, user\ntests were performed regularly, applying iterative design until the final stage.\nMethod\nIn the summer of 1998, six months after the initial installation, the programme was subject to a\nsurvey, partly based on the methodology described by Maxwell (1996). The aim was to find\nboth quantitative and qualitative measures of its outcome, and to identify critical factors.\nEighty-seven users were selected from the log files on the server and were asked to fill in a\nWeb-based questionnaire, containing both open and closed questions. Forty-seven answers\nwere received. The selection process was not entirely random, since email addresses were\ndifficult to find for all users. In-depth interviews were carried out with a manager, a developer\nand two users. Minutes from user tests during the implementation phase have also been used as\ndata for this paper.\nThe methodologies proposed by Quentin-Baxter and Dewhurst (1992) or Yildiz and Atkins\n(1993) would have provided more data for the study. However, their level of detail is more\nsuitable for fundamental research, and they could not be applied in this project due to limited\nresources.\nResults\nLow penetration\nDuring the first six months, 360 new users registered on the site, of which 150 completed the\nentire programme. The low penetration is accounted for by three factors.\nFirst, the programme is not compulsory. In the future, all Telia employees will go through the\nprogramme, but for the moment it is voluntary. In today's stressed working situation it is\ndifficult to motivate staff to find the three to four hours necessary to go through the material.\nSecond, difficulties with browser plug-ins on client computers were not resolved in time.\nNormally at Telia, installation and upgrading of software on desktop computers is handled\nremotely and automatically, at night, from a central server. Thus, all computers have correct\ninstallations of the latest software version. Productivity losses are avoided, and maintenance\ncosts, which otherwise constitute a large part of the total cost of ownership for computer\nsystems (Gartner, 1994), are kept at a minimum.\nHowever, because of licence fees, some of the required browser plug-ins were not installed on\nall computers. Instead, new users had the option to go through an introductory module. This\nmodule not only explains various features of the site, but also performs tests on the client\ncomputer in order to determine if the necessary plug-ins are present. If this is not the case, the\n57\nVlod lonesco Staff edutainmerrt on a corporate intranet - lessons learned\nuser receives installation instructions. However, this proved too difficult an obstacle to users\nwithout a technical background.\nFinally, the programme was not properly advertised on Telia's internal information channels,\nmany potential users remaining unaware of its existence.\nTo improve user participation, Telia took several measures. The required plug-ins were\nincorporated in the automated software installation scheme. Heavy advertising on the intranet\nwill bring people's attention to the project A contest with attractive prizes will hopefully be a\nsufficient incentive to complete the programme.\nHigh appreciation\nThe low penetration is paired with high appreciation, as user reactions have been very positive.\nFor instance, 97 per cent of the users in the survey rated the overall impression of the site as\n'good' or 'very good', 98 per cent appreciated the mixture of media types, and all users found\nthis instance of edutainment superior to, say, a traditional booklet. Even if the users having\ncompleted the programme so far are lead users, with a special interest in environmental issues,\nthe figures are still very encouraging.\nThe interviews and answers to the open questions in the questionnaire also indicate that users\nfound the site refreshing and inspiring. The varied media types conveyed the information and\nthe underlying message, while retaining their interest. Several users explicitly mentioned that\nthe programme did not suffer from the kindergarten pace and mentality present in some other\nmultimedia applications.\nThe information content was perceived as useful and relevant by 96 per cent of the users. Still,\nsome users demanded a closer connection to their respective business areas, while others found\nthe material too wordy, arguing that the three to four hours necessary to go through it are too\nmany. Either way the content is balanced, it will be difficult to find a solution that satisfies each\nand everyone. The best one can hope for is a reasonable compromise.\nThe user interface was perceived as functional and easy to use, consistency and simplicity being\nidentified as two key factors. Navigation through the material was well supported, as the current\nlocation was always indicated together with clearly marked links. The introductory module\ncontributed to the success, explaining various features of the site in detail, and giving the user a\nfeeling of what to expect and how to act. An interesting point to note is that while the glossary\nwas extensively used, the annotation tool was only used by a handful of users. Apparently it\nadded no value, and scribbling on a piece of paper was found superior.\nLessons learned\nDuring the survey process, it became increasingly obvious that it would have been useful to\nestablish clear and measurable goals at the beginning of the project. However, the goal is not\nonly immediate and cognitive, but also long-term and behavioural, making it difficult both to\ndefine and to achieve.\nAn evaluation module should also have been incorporated in the on-line material, as immediate\nfeedback from the users is more valuable than delayed feedback. Better identification of users\nand logging of user behaviour should have been implemented, in order to find out which tools\nare used, how often, and which parts of the programme are in most need of improvement.\n58\nAti-J Volume 7 Number I\nAs contact among students, and between students and educators enhances the learning process,\ncommunication should be improved, for instance by using listservs and newsgroups (Gibson\nand Rutherford, 1998). In the programme, only a simple email function was present in the\nnavigation toolbar, meant to be used to submit questions and feedback to the educators.\nHowever, this was seldom used, and no interaction took place until the seminar.\nAs Telia relies heavily on its intranet for the information dissemination, most office workers\nregard themselves as experienced Web users (88 per cent in the survey), and have their own\ndesktop computers. Still, user tests revealed that users have no in-depth understanding of how\nbrowsers and the Web work. A simple and user-friendly interface is thus of utmost importance,\nespecially as the long-term goal is to let all Telia's employees go through the programme, not\nonly the office workers. Users should not be expected to install any software without the help of\nthe support department. The best solution is automated centralized installation.\nManagement commitment is just as important as implementation issues. Users must feel that\nthere is a purpose with the programme, that it is not just a fad, or mere empty words. Different\nprojects and a high workload all compete for employees' time. To avoid conflicts of interest,\npriorities must be clarified and time must be allocated for education. Follow-up and continuous\nupdates must be undertaken to maintain credibility.\nThe main technological difficulties were caused by somewhat capricious plug-ins, behaving\ndifferently in different browsers and on different platforms. Unfortunately, plug-ins are essential\nif the site is to contain more than simple text. Thus, it is important to specify exactly what hard-\nand software is going to be used, and to perform extensive testing before the material is\nreleased. The negotiation and co-ordination required between the subsidiary IT departments of\na large corporation such as Telia can be an unwieldy process.\nThe corporate intranet offers a more stable environment and higher capacity than the Internet.\nStill, bandwidth proved to be an area of concern, as users in remote geographical locations\ncomplained of excessive download times. Possible solutions are proxy servers, improved\ninfrastructure, and optimization and compression of the multimedia objects.\nIn conclusion, the Telia case indicates that a multimedia staff education programme on the\nintranet is indeed a viable and successful solution, being appreciated by the users, and offering\nseveral advantages. Hopefully, the concept can be further improved, based on the observations\npresented in this paper.\nReferences\nGartner (1994), The Cost of LAN Computing: A Working Model, Gartner Group Inc.\nGibson, J. and Rutherford, P.
