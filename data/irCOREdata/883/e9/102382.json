INTRODUCTION\nCOMMUNICATIONS over wireless channels in an ad hocnetwork usually suffer from high frame-error rates due\nto the limited transmission power, the user mobility, and the\nlack of protection against interfering signals. Automatic repeat\nrequest (ARQ) schemes are de facto parts of wireless link-\nlayer protocols to combat the high frame-error rate and to\navoid expensive retransmissions of erroneous data blocks by the\ntransport layer\u2019s error-control mechanism [2], [3]. Conventional\nARQ schemes have been designed for wireline networks, where\nthe frame errors are random. By random error, we mean that\nthere is no correlation between frame-error probabilities for\ndifferent frames. However, due to the inherent characteristics\nof the fading process in wireless channels, the frame errors\nappear in bursts rather than randomly. When the link between\ntwo communicating nodes is experiencing frame errors, there is\na high probability that the bad channel condition will continue\nfor a considerably long period. The duration of a bad channel\ncondition or channel fading may be as long as the transmis-\nsion time of multiple data frames. Conventional retransmission\nschemes are not very effective in such environments with\nManuscript received November 22, 2004; revised June 2, 2005 and August\n2, 2005.

The review\nof this paper was coordinated by Prof. Y.-B. Lin.\nThe authors are with the Center for Wireless Communications, Department\nof Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo,\nON N2L 3G1, Canada (e-mail: mdianati@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca; x2ling@bbcr.\nuwaterloo.ca; knaik@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca; xshen@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TVT.2005.863426\nbursty frame errors and will cause significant degradation in the\nperformance of a link-layer protocol [14].\nRecently, spatial-diversity techniques in different forms of\nmultiple transmit and receive antennas have been proposed to\nimprove the quality of communication over wireless fading\nchannels. Multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) commu-\nnication systems [4], [5] and the corresponding channel coding\ntechniques, such as space time coding (STC) [6], have been pro-\nposed to utilize space diversity in the next-generation wireless\nnetworks. However, the implementation of multiple antennas\non small mobile devices is quite difficult due to the device-\nsize and cost constraints. An alternative form of space diversity\ncan be achieved in a multiuser environment by allowing nodes\nto cooperate [1], [6], [7]. In cooperative communications, each\nnode not only transmits and receives data for its own applica-\ntions, but can also provide an alternative path for the other pairs\nof communicating nodes. In other words, each node acts as a\nrelay node to facilitate better communications between other\npairs of nodes at the link level.\nThe theoretical and implementation aspects of cooperative\ndiversity in the physical layer have been areas of active interest\namong researchers [8]\u2013[10]. However, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, the impacts of cooperative techniques on the upper layers\nof communication protocols have not been thoroughly studied\nso far.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple but effective ARQ scheme,\nnamely node-cooperative stop and wait (NCSW) for wireless\nad hoc networks. The proposed scheme is inspired by the idea\nof cooperative diversity in order to improve the performance of\nlink-layer protocols. In the NCSW, nodes in the transmission\nrange of each other form temporary cooperation groups. In\nconventional retransmission schemes, the neighbor nodes are\noblivious to the ongoing transmission between a sender node\nand a receiver node. However, in the NCSW scheme, neighbor\nnodes that have enough resources and are willing to cooperate\ncan assist the sender node in the retransmission process by\nretransmitting the same copy of the previous frame simulta-\nneously. Intuitively, cooperation among individual nodes can\nincrease the probability of a successful retransmission and\nmitigates negative impacts of the fading process. In order to\ninvestigate this intuition, we develop analytical models for the\nthroughput, the average delay, and the delay jitter of the NCSW\nscheme by using a two-state Markov process for wireless fading\nchannels. We present results of Monte Carlo simulations in\norder to demonstrate the better performance of the proposed\nscheme and to verify the accuracy of the analytical models.\nBoth the analytical and the simulation results indicate that\n0018-9545\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Ad hoc wireless network model.\ncooperation of a small number of nodes can produce significant\nperformance gain, especially when the average quality of the\nchannel between the sender and the receiver nodes is poor.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nthe underlying assumptions and the system model are specified.\nThe proposed ARQ scheme and the analytical models are pre-\nsented in Section III. Simulation results are given in Section IV.\nSome concluding remarks and possible future research are\ngiven in Section V.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider an ad hoc wireless network model as shown\nin Fig. 1. For the sake of generality, a group of autonomous\nnodes without any central control is considered. Although\nthere is no fixed infrastructure, the model can generalize other\ntypes of wireless networks with infrastructures, such as cellular\nnetworks and wireless LANs (WLANs). In fact, a single node\nin this model can be a mobile device, a base station, or an\naccess point. A cooperation group is a subset of nodes that can\nreach each other with a single hop. In other words, nodes in a\ncooperation group are in the radio coverage area of each other.\nCooperation groups may be set up during the connection\nsetup stage (e.g., call setup in cellular networks or association in\nWLAN) or packet level handshaking. There is no need for extra\nsignaling in order to form and manage cooperation groups.\nCooperation groups are dynamic groups without tight mem-\nbership requirement. Each neighbor node may join several co-\noperation groups depending on its position, capability, and\nwillingness to cooperate. The overall structure of cooperation\ngroups can be different in the transmission time of different\npackets. Thus, the mobility of nodes does not disrupt the op-\neration. As shown in Fig. 2, each of those cooperation groups\ncan be modeled as a single-hop wireless network. At any time\ninstant, one sender node captures the shared media to send a\nburst of frames to its intended destination node. During that\ntime period, the neighbor nodes in the group monitor the\nshared channel to assist the sender and the receiver nodes if an\nerror happens. The whole process is transparent from a sender\nFig. 2. Single cooperation group.\nFig. 3. Markov model for frame success\/failure process over wireless fading\nchannels.\nnode\u2019s point of view. Thus, a sender node performs its normal\noperation. A receiver node only needs to know the number\nand identity of the neighbor nodes during the current packet\ntransmission time. Intuitively, node cooperation can improve\nthe probability of a successful retransmission if there are extra\nresources available. Otherwise, all nodes perform their normal\noperations.\nA. Fading-Channel Model\nVariations of the wireless channel gains due to the destructive\nand constructive combination of multiple propagations with dif-\nferent path delays and center frequencies is known as a fading\nprocess. For flat fading channels, where the power spectrum\ndensity of the channel is constant over the whole frequency\nband of the information signal, a two-state Markov process as\nillustrated in Fig. 3 can adequately describe the process of a\nframe success or a failure [13]. The channel is deemed to be\nin the good state (G) if a transmitted frame can be correctly\ndecoded by the receiver; otherwise, when the channel is in\nthe bad state (B), the transmitted frame cannot be decoded\nsuccessfully and needs to be retransmitted by the sender.\nIf the channel is in state G during the transmission time\nof the current frame, it will either stay in state G with a\nprobability (1\u2212 q) or move to state B with a probability q\nin the transmission time of the next frame. Similarly, starting\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 3, 2009 at 12:10 from IEEE Xplore.

Let\nTf be the duration of a single frame. Assuming a nonadaptive\nchannel coding rate and a quasi-static fading process (i.e.,\nthe fading level is constant for the entire frame duration), the\ntransmitted frame k cannot be decoded properly by the receiver\nif the channel power gain is below a certain threshold \u03b3 at a\ntime instant k, i.e.,\n\u0004(k) =\n{\nB, if |\u03b6(k)|2 \u2264 \u03b3\nG, if |\u03b6(k)|2 > \u03b3 (1)\nwhere \u03b6(k) represents the complex value of the fading envelope\nin the transmission time of frame k. For slow fading channels,\nthe fading envelope can be considered constant for the entire\nframe duration, i.e., the fading envelope can be considered as a\nquasi-static process. For a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel,\ni.e., \u03b6(k) has a Rayleigh probability distribution function (pdf),\nit has been shown in [14] that the transition parameters of the\ntwo-state Markov process in Fig. 3 can be given by\nr =\nQ(\u03b8, \u03c1\u03b8)\u2212Q(\u03c1\u03b8, \u03b8)\ne\u03b3 \u2212 1\nq =\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3\ne\u2212\u03b3\nr (2)\nwhere Q(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the Marcum Q function\n\u03b8 =\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\n1\u2212 \u03c12\nand\n\u03c1 = J0(2\u03c0fmTf)\nand J0(\u00b7) is the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind.\nSimilar Markovian models for the Rician and the Nakagami flat\nfading channels have been given in [15] and [16], respectively.\nB. Protocol Model\nIn wireless ad hoc networks, the propagation delays among\nnodes are much smaller than the frame duration. For a link with\na short propagation delay, a frame-by-frame acknowledgment\nmechanism such as the stop and wait (SW) transmission scheme\nis more efficient than the complex schemes such as the go\nback N (GBN) and the selective repeat (SR) retransmission\nschemes. For example, the IEEE 802.11 compatible products\nadopt an SW-like retransmission scheme. Thus, in this paper,\nwe adopt the SW as the core of the proposed ARQ scheme. For\nthe SW ARQ scheme, the sender node does not transmit the\nnext frame until the correct reception of the previous frame is\nconfirmed by an explicit or implicit acknowledgment (ACK).\nWe also assume that the feedback channels, used for transmit-\nting ACK and negative acknowledgment (NAK), are error free.\nThus, the ACK\/NAK frames can be received immediately and\ncorrectly by all the nodes in a cooperation group. For the SW\nretransmission discipline with the aforementioned assumptions,\ngiven a two-state Markovian frame success\/failure model for\nthe wireless channel, the throughput of the SW ARQ scheme\nhas been given in [17] as\n\u03b7SW =\nr\nr + q\n(3)\nwhere q and r are the parameters of the Markov model, as\nshown in Fig. 3.\nIII. NODE-COOPERATIVE SW SCHEME\nDepending on the relative velocity of communicating nodes,\nthe average duration of a channel fading can be as long as\nthe transmission time of several frames. For example, for a\nslow fading channel with a node speed of 5 km\/h and a carrier\nfrequency fc = 2.4 GHz, the average fading duration is about\n60 ms [11]. For a typical frame length of 5 ms, a naive\nretransmission scheme such as the conventional SW has to\nretransmit an erroneous frame for an average of 12 times. The\nsituation may be even worse in high-rate systems with shorter\nframe durations.\nSpace diversity is a well-known technique in communication\nsystems to combat fading in wireless channels by providing\ndiverse and independent paths between a transmitter and a\nreceiver. In our network model shown in Fig. 1, since the chan-\nnel status between different pairs of nodes are independent of\neach other, node cooperation can be used to implement a variant\nof space diversity, which is known as a cooperative diversity [7].\nCooperation among those nodes that happen to be in the same\nradio coverage area of each other can significantly improve\nthe performance of a retransmission scheme by reducing the\nnumber of unsuccessful retransmission trials.\nInspired by the cooperative diversity, we propose an NCSW\nARQ scheme. The core concept can be explained using the\nmodel shown in Fig. 2, where a sender node is transmitting\nto a destination node and a typical neighbor node is listening\nto the ongoing communication. In the NCSW, the error-control\nprocedures of the sender and the receiver nodes are the same\nas those of a conventional SW retransmission scheme in Fig. 4.\nHowever, the neighbor nodes in a cooperation group implement\nan additional functionality, as shown in Fig. 5. If a transmit-\nted frame cannot be decoded successfully by the receiver, as\npart of its normal operation, the receiver node will send an\nNAK to the sender node asking for a retransmission of the\nerroneous frame, and the sender node will respond to the NAK\nby retransmitting the frame. In the conventional retransmission\nscheme, the neighbor nodes are oblivious to the retransmissions\nbetween the sender and the receiver nodes. However, in the\nNCSW scheme, all the other nodes in the cooperation group\nmonitor the ongoing communications between the sender and\nthe receiver nodes. The neighbor nodes decode and store a\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 3, 2009 at 12:10 from IEEE Xplore.

SW ARQ (a) sender and (b) receiver.\ncopy of the last unacknowledged transmitted frame until the\nreception of a corresponding ACK. When a transmitted frame\nis acknowledged by the destination node, all the nodes in the\ncooperation group will drop their copy of the corresponding\nframe. However, when the neighbor nodes in a cooperation\ngroup receive an NAK from the destination node, they will\ncooperate with the sender in the retransmission process. Ob-\nviously, a node in a cooperation group can retransmit only if\nit has already received a correct copy of the requested frame.\nEven if a neighbor node has received a correct copy of the\nframe, cooperation is not mandatory, and each node may avoid\ncooperation for internal reasons or network considerations. This\nfreedom of choice guarantees a backward compatibility of the\nNCSW protocol with the conventional SW protocol.\nIf proper coding and decoding schemes such as the dis-\ntributed STC [12] are implemented in the physical layer, the\nprobability of a successful retransmission will be significantly\nincreased due to the diversity gain that can be achieved from the\nindependent and diverse paths. Intuitively, if the channel coding\nscheme is capable of achieving a full diversity gain and all\nneighbor nodes have a correct copy of the frame, the probability\nof a successful retransmission for the NCSW scheme is (1\u2212\u220fn\ni Pei), where Pei is the probability of a frame error from\nnode i in the cooperation group to the destination node, and n\nis the number of all the cooperating nodes plus the sender node.\nFig. 5. Cooperation procedure in the NCSW ARQ.\nA. Protocol Analysis Model\nIn this section, we develop an analytical model to describe\nthe frame success\/failure process for the proposed NCSW ARQ\nscheme. The model is a key component for analyzing useful\nperformance metrics such as throughput, average delay, and\ndelay jitter. We accomplish the analysis in three steps.\n1) We derive a cooperation model for a pair of sender and\nreceiver nodes with a single neighbor node.\n2) We model the impacts of an arbitrary number of neighbor\nnodes in the cooperation group as an equivalent super\nneighbor node.\n3) We combine the model for the super neighbor node from\nstep 2 and the cooperation model from step 1 to obtain\na model for the frame success\/failure process for a pair\nof sender and receiver nodes and an arbitrary number of\nneighbor nodes.\nIn step 1, we consider a sender\/receiver pair of nodes with a\nsingle neighbor node as shown in Fig. 6. A two-state Markov\nmodel, as described in Section II, is used to specify a success\nor a failure of transmissions over a wireless fading channel.\nWe use three distinct two-state Markov processes to model the\nprimary channel from the sender node to the receiver node, the\ninterim channel from the sender node to the neighbor node,\nand the relay channel from the neighbor node to the destin-\nation node.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

For the primary channel\n[\n1\u2212 q q\nr 1\u2212 r\n]\n.\nFor the interim channel[\n1\u2212 x x\ny 1\u2212 y\n]\n.\nFor the relay channel\n[\n1\u2212 a a\nb 1\u2212 b\n]\n.\nThe corresponding transition probabilities are (q, r), (x, y), and\n(a, b), respectively. During the transmission time of frame k,\nthe neighbor node is in state B if it is not able to cooperate\nin the possible retransmission of the (k \u2212 1)th frame; other-\nwise, the neighbor node is considered to be in state G. Assum-\ning that the neighbor node is always willing to cooperate, it\nwill be in state B at time instant k if frame (k \u2212 1) cannot be\ndecoded properly by that particular neighbor node, or the relay\nchannel from that particular neighbor to the receiver node is in\nstate B at the time instant k. With this argument, the status of the\nneighbor node at time instant k can be formulated as follows:\nN(k) =\n{\nG, if I(k \u2212 1) = G and R(k) = G\nB, otherwise (4)\nwhere I(k) and R(k) denote the states of the interim and relay\nchannels, respectively.\nA four-state Markov model, as shown in Fig. 7, can be used\nto represent the process of transition among different states of\n{I(k \u2212 1),R(k)}.\nLet \u03c0i denote the probability of being in state Si in Fig. 7.\nThe following set of linear equations can be solved to obtain \u03c0i\nfor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 3:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\nA00 A10 A20 A30\nA01 A11 A21 A31\nA02 A12 A22 A32\nA03 A13 A23 A33\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u03c00\n\u03c01\n\u03c02\n\u03c03\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u03c00\n\u03c01\n\u03c02\n\u03c03\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\u03c00 + \u03c01 + \u03c02 + \u03c03 =1 (5)\nwhere Aij is the probability of transition from state Si to state\nSj . As given in (4), N(k) can be modeled by another two-state\nMarkov process with transition parameters of (u, v), where u\nand v are defined as follows:\nu\n\u2206=P {N(k) = B|N(k \u2212 1) = G}\nv\n\u2206=P {N(k) = G|N(k \u2212 1) = B} . (6)\nFrom the Markov process shown in Fig. 7, it can be seen that\nu = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 x)(1\u2212 a). (7)\nWe can rewrite v in (6) in a slightly different form as\nv =\nP {N(k \u2212 1) = B|N(k) = G}P {N(k) = G}\nP {N(k \u2212 1) = B} . (8)\nThe solution of (5) can be combined with (8) to obtain v as\nv =\nu\u03c00\n1\u2212 \u03c00 . (9)\nThe Markov process specified by (7) and (9) characterizes\nthe status of a single neighbor node. In step 2, we propose an\niterative approach to reduce a cooperation group with multiple\nneighbor nodes to an equivalent cooperation group with only\none super neighbor node. Let M \u2265 2 be the total number of\nneighbor nodes. In the first iteration, we combine neighbor\nnodes 1 and 2 into one equivalent node. After that, the resulting\nequivalent node is combined with node 3, and so on, until all\nthe M neighbor nodes are combined together to form a single\nsuper neighbor node.\nLet N(1)(k) and N(2)(k) be the states of neighbor nodes 1\nand 2 at time instant k, respectively. Since a retransmission\nwill succeed if at least one of the neighbor nodes or the sender\nnode can successfully deliver the frame to the receiver node, the\ncombined cooperative node model for nodes 1 and 2, denoted\nby N(1,2)(k), can be represented by\nN(1,2)(k) =\n{\nG, if N(1)(k) = G or N(2)(k) = G\nB, otherwise.\n(10)\nThe discrete random process N(1,2)(k) as specified by (10)\ncan be modeled by a two-state Markov process, where its\nparameters are defined by\nu(1,2)\n\u2206=P\n{\nN(1,2)(k) = B|N(1,2)(k \u2212 1) = G\n}\nv(1,2)\n\u2206=P\n{\nN(1,2)(k) = G|N(1,2)(k \u2212 1) = B\n}\n. (11)\nLet (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) be the corresponding Markov para-\nmeters of N(1)(k) and N(2)(k), respectively. As explained in\nstep 1, (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) can be computed by (7) and (9) for\nnodes 1 and 2, respectively.

Packet fragmentation.\nfor the NCSW ARQ scheme and (3), the throughput of the\nNCSW scheme can be obtained as\n\u03b7NCSW =\nY\nY +X\n. (19)\nIn the following section, we use (18) to obtain the average\ndelay and the delay jitter of the NCSW ARQ scheme.\nB. Delay Analysis\nThe transmission of large frames over a wireless channel is\nnot efficient due to the high probability of frame error [18]. As\nshown in Fig. 11, large data blocks from the upper layers of the\ncommunication-protocol stack (i.e., network layer) are usually\nbroken into smaller fragments to avoid retransmissions of large\nframes in case of transmission errors. This technique is called\npacket fragmentation and has been adopted by some existing\nstandards, such as the IEEE 802.11 Medium Access Control\n(MAC) protocol.\nUsually, a sender node is allowed to capture the channel to\ncontinuously transmit all fragments of a single packet. Even in\na contention-based MAC protocol, the contention mechanism\nis designed to allow a node to transmit all the fragments as a\nburst before the next contention period begins. For example, in\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol as illustrated in Fig. 12, the\ninterframe spacing mechanism is designed to allow a sender\nto send a sequence of fragments without any interruption. We\ndefine an ARQ protocol delay as the time required to complete\nthe transmission of all the fragments of a single packet from\nthe network layer. Since we do not deal with any resource\nallocation problem in this paper, our delay analysis does not\nconsider the queuing delay. Thus, the transmission delay of an\nARQ protocol depends on the packet length and the number\nof retransmission trials. Without loss of generality, we assume\nthat all packets from the network layer have identical length\nand are fragmented into np frames of identical length Tf . Thus,\nthe results can be considered as conditional results for a given\nvalue of np. For the case of variable packet length with a known\npdf, we can simply compute the expected value of the results.\nWe also include the ACK\/NAK handshake time in the frame\nlength. In the best scenario, when there is no frame error, the\nentire transmission delay will be equal to npTf . However, the\naverage transmission delay is expected to be higher than this\nideal value due to possible frame errors. Given the two-state\nMarkov model in Fig. 9, the average delay can be given by\ntp =\nX + Y\nY\n\u00b7 Tf . (20)\nNext, we introduce a Markov chain with an absorbing state\nin order to obtain the delay jitter for the NCSW scheme. Let\n(q, r) be the parameters of the two-state Markov model in\nFig. 9 (we replace [X,Y ] with [q, r] to simplify the notations).\nThe transmission process of a single fragmented packet can be\ndescribed by a (2np + 1)-state Markov chain with an absorbing\nstate, as shown in Fig. 13.\nAt the beginning, the system is in Snp,T where there are np\nfragments in the transmission queue. If the first transmission\nsucceeds, the system moves to state S(np\u22121),T; otherwise, it will\nmove to state S(np\u22121),R, where it retransmits the first fragment.\nThis transition rule applies to all states, until the system moves\ninto the absorbing state S0,T, where all fragments of the packet\nin the transmission queue have been transmitted successfully. In\norder to make the mathematical manipulations simple, as shown\nin Fig. 13, we assign integer indices from 0 to 2np to the system\nstates. The initial and the absorbing states are given index\nnumbers 2np and 0, respectively. All S\u2217,R states are given odd\nnumbers, and the S\u2217,T states are assigned even numbers from 2\nto 2np. The (2np + 1)\u00d7 (2np + 1) state transition probability\nmatrix (\u03a0) is given in (21), where the (i, j) element denoted\nby pij is the probability of transition from state i to state j,\nr\u00af = 1\u2212 r and q\u00af = 1\u2212 q.\n\u03a0 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n1 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0\nr r\u00af 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0\nq\u00af q 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 r r\u00af \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 q\u00af q \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 r r\u00af 0\n0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 q\u00af q 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n.

The impacts of\npath loss and shadowing are not considered due to their very\nslow variations compared with the activities of a link layer.\nThe Rayleigh fading channels are simulated by low-pass finite\nimpulse response (FIR) filtering of two white Gaussian random\nprocesses. The simulation parameters for the fading channels\nare given in Table II.\nThe quality of the channel is represented in terms of the\nratio of the fading margin over the mean value of the fading\nenvelope as\nL =\n\u221a\n\u03b3\nE [|\u03b6(t)|] . (23)\nThe mean value of the fading channels is normalized to a\nunit; thus, L = \u221a\u03b3. In other words, variations in the values\nof the fading margin are translated to the variations in the\nchannel quality. As illustrated in Fig. 14, if the value of the\nfading margin is increased, the channel quality will be below\nthe threshold value more frequently. This means that as the\nvalue of the fading margin is increased, there will be more\nframe errors, which translates to poorer channel quality.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Concept of a fading margin.\nFig. 15. Throughput versus fading margin of the primary channel.\nThe data frame duration is set to be 5 ms, which is reasonable\nfor many wireless data networks. A perfect ACK\/NAK infor-\nmation on the feedback channels is assumed to be available for\nthe whole cooperation group right after a frame transmission.\nIn the following sections, we present both the simulation and\nanalytical results for the throughput, the average delay, and the\ndelay jitter of the NCSW scheme.\nA. Throughput\nTo observe the impact of a small number of cooperative\nnodes on the system throughput, the SW and the NCSW\nschemes with only two neighbor nodes are simulated. The\nthroughput values of both schemes are obtained from simula-\ntions and analyses. As shown in Fig. 15, the results are plotted\nagainst the variations of the quality of the primary channel\ndenoted by Lp. The quality of all interim and relay channels\nare assumed to be identical and denoted by Lr. To demonstrate\nthe impact of the variations in the quality of the interim\/relay\nFig. 16. Throughput versus number of the neighbor nodes (Lp = \u22121 dB).\nchannels, the throughput of the NCSW protocol is plotted for\ntwo different values of Lr, namely, \u22125 and \u22121 dB.\nThe results in Fig. 15 show that, with cooperation of only\ntwo neighbor nodes, the throughput of the NCSW scheme\ncan be improved up to 30%, depending on the quality of the\ninterim\/relay channels. A comparison of the analytical and\nthe simulation results also demonstrates the accuracy of the\nproposed analytical model for the system throughput.\nTo investigate the impact of the number of neighbor nodes\non the protocol throughput, the fading margin of the primary\nchannel is set to Lp = \u22121 dB. At this relatively low quality\nof the primary channel, we can clearly observe the impact of\nthe number of neighbor nodes on the system throughput. Sim-\nulations are performed for two different fading margins for the\nrelay\/interim channels, namely Lr = \u22125 dB and Lr = \u22121 dB.\nAs shown in Fig. 16, when the number of the cooperative nodes\nincreases, the system throughput approaches a saturation level\ndepending on the quality of the primary and the interim\/relay\nchannels. If the qualities of the interim\/relay channels are\ngood, having only one or two neighbor nodes can significantly\nimprove the system performance; however, when the qualities\nof the interim\/relay channels are poor, more neighbor nodes\nare required to achieve the same level of performance gain.\nSaturation of the system throughput is also expected. In fact,\nregardless of the number of neighbor nodes or their channel\nqualities, individual frame errors cannot be avoided. However,\ncooperation of the neighbor nodes can reduce the duration of\nerror bursts.\nAnother important issue is to separately investigate the im-\npacts of variations in the quality of the interim and the relay\nchannels. The results of this analysis can be helpful in deciding\nwhen a node should cooperate. Such a decision can be based\non the average quality of the channels from the sender and\nto the receiver nodes. To keep the system setup consistent\nwith the previous simulations, we obtain the system throughput\nfor only 2 neighbor nodes. We set the fading margin of the\nprimary channel at a fixed level of Lp = \u22121 dB and perform\nthe simulations twice. For the first run, we set the fading margin\nof the relay channels Lrelay at a fixed level of \u22125 dB and let\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Throughput versus the fading margin of the interim\/relay channels\n(Lp = \u22121 dB).\nthe fading margin of the interim channels Linterim vary from\n\u22125 to 0 dB. In the second run, for a fixed fading margin of\nthe interim channels at \u22125 dB, we let the fading margin of the\nrelay channels vary from \u22125 to 0 dB. As shown in Fig. 17, the\nsystem throughput follows the same form of variations against\nthe quality of the relay and the interim channels.\nB. Average Delay and Delay Jitter\nWe simulate the SW and the NCSW protocols with only\ntwo cooperating neighbor nodes for our delay analysis. For the\nNCSW scheme, we assume moderate interim and relay channel\nqualities at a fading margin of \u22122.5 dB. The other channel\nparameters are the same as in Table II. The fading margin for the\nprimary channel is varied from \u22125 dB (good channel quality)\nto 0 dB (bad channel quality). Packets from the upper layer, i.e.,\nnetwork layer, are fragmented into 20 frames of 5-ms durations\n(including ACK\/NAK); therefore, if there is no transmission\nerror, it will take 100 ms for all the fragments of a single\npacket to be transmitted. However, as shown in Fig. 18, on the\naverage, it will require more than 100 ms due to frame errors.\nAs shown in the figure, for a small number of cooperative\nnodes with moderate interim\/relay channel qualities, the NCSW\nprotocol significantly outperforms the SW protocol in terms of\ntransmission delay. For example, when the primary channel is\npoor (Lp = 0 dB), the average delay for the SW scheme is\nabout 265 ms; however, for the same channel condition, the\nNCSW protocol can reduce the average delay to 160 ms. Thus,\ndue to node cooperation, the average delay is reduced by 60%\nwhen the primary link is experiencing a poor condition.\nWith the same simulation setup, we also investigate the\ndelay jitter caused by the transmission errors in both schemes.\nAgain, by comparing the results given in Fig. 19, we observe a\nsignificant improvement in the performance in terms of reduced\ndelay jitter. For example, when the primary channel is in a poor\ncondition, the delay jitter is reduced from 140 to 20 ms, which\nis equivalent to an 85% reduction. Furthermore, the exponential\ngrowth in the delay jitter is reduced to a slow linear growth. The\nFig. 18. Delay versus the fading margin of the primary channel.\nFig. 19. Jitter versus the fading margin of the primary channel.\nimprovement of the delay jitter is more remarkable than that\nof the delay and the throughput. Intuitively, since node coop-\neration reduces the negative impact of long and varying error\nbursts, this significant improvement in the jitter is expected.\nThis is a very important advantage of the proposed scheme for\nreal-time multimedia applications, such as voice over Internet\nprotocol (IP), where reducing the delay jitter is a challenging\ntask in providing the desired quality of service.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have proposed an NCSW ARQ scheme for wireless\nad hoc networks. We developed analytical models for the\nretransmission process and its tangible performance metrics,\nsuch as throughput, average delay, and delay jitter. Simulation\nresults were also given to demonstrate the performance gain\nand to verify the analytical models.

The remarkable gains in the average-delay and delay-\njitter performance are of significant importance for real-time\nmultimedia applications.\nOur future research includes the study of the impact of dif-\nferent coding and signal processing techniques at the physical\nlayer and integration issues with the existing MAC protocols,\nsuch as the standard IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol.\nAPPENDIX\nDERIVATION OF DELAY JITTER\nDelay jitter is the standard deviation of the packet transmis-\nsion delay, which is defined as\n\u03c3p\n\u2206=\n\u221a\nE [(Tp \u2212 tp)2]. (24)\nWe can rewrite (24) as\n\u03c32p = E\n[\n(Dp \u2212 dp)2\n] \u00b7 T 2f .\nThen\n\u03c32p = E\n[\n(D2np \u2212 d2np)2\n] \u00b7 T 2f .

Starting from a nonabsorbing state\nj, the system either moves to the absorbing state in one step or\ngets to the absorbing state via one or more nonabsorbing states.\nThe probability of the first event is\nP{go to the absorbing state in one step\n|current state is j} = pj0.\nThe probability of the second event is\nP{go to a nonabsorbing state|current state is j}=\n2np\u2211\ni=1\npji.\nIf the latter case happens, the time of absorption is (1 +Di).\nThus, we have\nDj = 1\u00d7 pj0 +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\npji(1 +Di)\nand \u03b42i is given by\n\u03b42i = pj0 +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\nE\n[\n(1 +Di)2\n]\npji\n= pj0 +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\n(\n1 + 2di + \u03b42i\n)\npji\n= pj0 +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\npji\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\u22112np\ni=0\npji=1\n+2\n2np\u2211\ni=1\ndipji +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b42i pji\n=1 +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\ndipji +\n2np\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b42i pji.
