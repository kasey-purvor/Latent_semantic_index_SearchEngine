These tendencies \ncan be broadly characterised as, in different ways, taking up and dealing with the work of \nDeleuze and Bergson (or \u201ethe Bergsonism of Deleuze\u201f as Suzanne Guerlac [2006] \nphrases it)\n1. Elizabeth Grosz\u201fs work (1994, 1999a, 1999b, 2000, 2005a, 2005b) is \nexemplary of this trend although other feminist theorists have also thought through \nDeleuze and Bergson to create new ideas of gendered bodies (for example Braidotti 1994, \n2001, 2006; Weiss 1999; Colebrook 2000; Buchanan and Colebrook 2000). Central to \nthese shifts to Bergsonian and Deleuzian concepts is an understanding of temporality not \nas linear but as dynamic and heterogeneous; time does not (only) progress from past to \npresent to future but rather, in Bergson\u201fs and Deleuze\u201fs terms, time is multiple and \nassembling. As Grosz suggests above, \u201ethe past, present and future are entwined\u201f. Here, I \nconsider what a feminist reading of Bergson\u201fs and Deleuze\u201fs understandings of time \nmight do to conceptions of the relations between bodies and images and, more especially, \nto the ways in which bodies become through images which endure and which assemble as \nnovel temporalities.  \n \nMy focus on feminist theory, rather than on social and cultural theory more widely, is \nbecause notions of novelty and the future are interesting to examine in relation to \n 5 \nfeminism as a \u201eprogressive\u201f movement. That is, feminism as a political movement seeks \nto assess the material and imaginary conditions of women\u201fs pasts and presents and \npropose and progress towards different futures. One question I address here, then, \nconcerns the status of time and the future in feminist theory and the ways in which \nfeminist attention to Bergson\u201fs and Deleuze\u201fs conceptions of time might conceive the \nrelations between the past, present and future. Making clear how a feminist theory which \ntakes up Deleuze\u201fs and Bergson\u201fs work conceives the relations between different \ntemporalities, the future and novelty is necessary to demonstrate how a focus on \u201ethe \nnew\u201f does not sideline or ignore the past and its interaction with the present and future. \nIntroducing the concept of the virtual, and in particular the relations between the virtual \nand duration, I explore how an orientation to novelty and the future does not suggest a \nfuture temporality which is disconnected from other (past and present) temporalities but \ninstead a future which is, necessarily, the assemblage of past and present temporalities. \nAs such, I argue that a tendency towards the future does not mean that feminist theory \ndisregards the past and present but that it engages these temporalities in different, or \n\u201enew\u201f, ways.  \n \nTo examine these ideas, my focus is empirical as well as theoretical. I explore empirical \nresearch with thirteen 13 and 14 year old girls concerned with the relations between their \nbodies and images (see Coleman forthcoming). The girls who participated were aged 13 \nand 14, were all white and came from two British schools, one in south east London and \none in Oxfordshire. The research involved different kinds of interviews with the girls: a \nfocus group, individual interviews and a group image-making session where the girls \n 6 \ncreated images of their bodies by using magazines, Polaroid photographs, make-up, sweet \nwrappers and craft materials. The interviews were all conducted at the girls\u201f respective \nschools in school time. The research took a feminist-Deleuzian position and explored \nbodies and images not as separate or separable entities but as processes which become \nthrough each other. As such, bodies and images are seen as dynamic processes of \nmovement and transformation, rather than as static and bounded forms. At the heart of \nthe concept of becoming is this movement and transformation and also, crucially, \u201ethe \nendless unfolding of the new\u201f (Grosz 1999a: 5). Becoming also suggests the inter-\nconnectedness of \u201ethings\u201f in the world (Deleuze and Guattari 1987); things (bodies and \nimages in this case) are always-already in relations with multiple and different things and, \nmoreover, the becoming of these things is through these relations. The research therefore \nmade central the relations between bodies and images. It understood images as producing \nknowledges, understandings and experiences of bodies and it explored the images that the \ngirls explained as important to them as making possible, and impossible, particular \nbecomings of bodies. \n \nAs indicated in the interview extract above, for the girls, \u201eimages\u201f of their bodies \nincluded those produced through comments from other people. I pick up on and conceive \nas images what some of the girls explain as comments which \u201estay with you\u201f, which are \n\u201econcentrate[d] on\u201f and which shape, or produce, experiences of their bodies; \u201ephobia\u201f, \nfor example. I explore these experiences that \u201estay\u201f through Bergson\u201fs notion of duration. \nDuration accounts for the specificity of a body\u201fs temporality and for the novelty involved \nin durational rhythms which endure. I suggest that things that stay can be understood as \n 7 \ndurations; intense moments of the past which endure and which assemble with present \nand future temporalities. The past in this sense does not determine the future but rather, in \nBergson\u201fs (1903\/ 1999, 1908\/ 2002) terms, the past is virtual and actualises the future. \nThe past endures and assembles to produce particular (actual) presents and futures. It is in \nthis necessary but non-determining relation between the past and future that the future is \nnovel and creative; assembled with and through the past but different (\u201ein kind\u201f [Deleuze \n2002]) to it. In the next section I outline some of the ways in which \u201etime\u201f and the future \nis conceived in feminist theory and explain, through the work of Grosz, how Bergson\u201fs \nand Deleuze\u201fs time might instead underpin feminist theory. Taking up this feminist \nBergsonian and Deleuzian time, I then explore the empirical material with a focus on \nhow the futurity of becoming accounts for the relations between the girls\u201f pasts, presents \nand futures.  \n \nFeminist theory, time and duration  \nThe quotation from Grosz above is a provocative call\ni\n for feminist theory to address \u201ethe \ncomplexities of time and becoming\u201f in order to ensure its \u201epractical efficacy as a politics \nof the future\u201f is not lost. For Grosz here, feminist theory \u201erisks being stuck in political \nstrategies and conceptual dilemmas that are more appropriate to the past than the future\u201f. \nMy aim in extracting this quotation from Grosz\u201fs sophisticated argument is not to present \nher feminist theory as antagonistic to other feminist theories but rather to take seriously, \nexamine, and think through in relation to empirical work, her suggestion that time and \nbecoming should be central to contemporary feminist theory. Grosz\u201fs comments on the \nneed for feminist theory to think time are in keeping with the focus on time and the \n 8 \nrelationship between feminist pasts, presents and futures in a number of recent \npublications (for example Adkins 2004; hoogland et al 2004; McRobbie 2004a, 2004b, \n2007; Hemmings 2005) and events (for example the European Journal of Women\u2019s \nStudies \u201ePassing on feminism\u201f conference, 2004, and the \u201eGenerations: On feminist \ntimelines\u201f conference, Goldsmiths College, 2006). One point that these various feminist \nlines of enquiry have in common is the problem of equating time with linear progress\n3\n. \nThat is, in different ways, feminist theory has been questioning the extent to which \nfeminism is linear in its progression to a better future, or in its nostalgia for a better past.  \n \nFor example, for Angela McRobbie (2004a, 2004b, 2007), the relationship between the \npasts, presents and futures of feminism demands urgent critical attention because of what \nshe describes as the incorporation of feminist ideals into contemporary (popular) culture \nin such a way that the feminist project is made to seem complete. Feminism cannot be \nconceived as linear (McRobbie 2004a: 721) because post-feminism operates through a \ndouble move in which feminist pasts are simultaneously built on and repudiated; \nfeminism is therefore not progressive.\n4\n Clare Hemmings also challenges the assumed \nprogress of feminist theory by examining how \u201eWestern feminist theory tells its own \nstory as a developmental narrative, where we move from a preoccupation with unity and \nsameness, through identity and diversity, and on to difference and fragmentation\u201f \n(Hemmings 2005: 115-116). She argues that this \u201estory\u201f is over-simplifying, depends on \nthe allocation of various theoretical concerns to neat decades and, moreover, presents \nfeminist theory according to either a narrative of progress (from the \u201eignorant\u201f, \u201einnocent\u201f \nor \u201eexclusionary\u201f 1970s to the difference and multiplicity of the post-structuralist 1990s) \n 9 \nor of loss (for a more political, collective past, manifested as nostalgia for the past\n5\n or a \n\u201emoving beyond\u201f the present) (Hemmings 2005: 126). While both McRobbie and \nHemmings are clearly, and differently, engaged in a \u201ecareful consideration\u201f of \u201etime\u201f in \nfeminist theory, the quotation from Grosz at the opening of the article urges \u201ethinking the \ncomplexities of time and becoming\u201f (my emphasis) and of the \u201epolitics of the future\u201f. As \nsuch, from the point of view of Grosz\u201fs call, what is not dealt with is the concept of \nbecoming and feminist theory\u201fs orientation to the novel. What I do in the rest of this \narticle, through empirical work on the becoming of bodies through images, is consider \nhow feminist theory might reconceive time through Bergsonian and Deleuzian notions of \nduration, the novel and the virtual. \n \nGrosz\u201fs insistence on the need for feminist theory to critically engage with becoming and \nthe future emerges through her reading of Bergson and Deleuze for whom the concepts \n(or the ontology) of becoming and novelty are key. As suggested above, becoming refers \nto the constant state of movement and transformation that things \u2013 bodies and images \u2013 \nare involved in, and the movement, transformation and becoming of these things through \ntheir inter-connectedness. Becoming, then, is necessarily tied to the new and to the future, \nto the novelty that is involved in transformation and to the openness and uncertainty that \nthis produces. Grosz links becoming and novelty to feminist theory, and feminist politics \nmore generally, and suggests that the  \n \nquestion of revolution, transformation and radical futures seems to be the \nunspoken heart of feminist politics: feminist politics cannot see itself except as a \n 10 \nform of overcoming and transformation, yet the very logic of change, the capacity \nto initiate a pragmatics of change, is central to its formation as a political and \ntheoretical practice (Grosz 2000: 217).  \n \nOne of Grosz\u201fs points here is that, while notions of transformation and \u201eradical futures\u201f \nunderpin feminist theory and politics, they usually remain implicit (Grosz 1999a). Indeed, \nshe goes on to argue that \u201e[t]he problem is that there is so little work being done under the \naegis of feminist theory on the question of time and futurity, and so much work, \nrelatively speaking, on the question of time, memory and history\u201f (Grosz 2000: 217). In \norder for feminist theory to \u201efind more adequate resources by which to think the radical \nopenness of the future\u201f and to \u201efundamentally orient[\u2026] to the status of futures\u201f, Grosz \nsuggests it must turn to, and think through, \u201enew conceptions of duration and becoming\u201f \n(Grosz 2000: 217). So what is meant by duration, and how does thinking through \nduration involve an orientation to novelty and the future? \n \nThe concept of duration is developed by Bergson as a means to contrast a notion of \n\u201eextensive\u201f time with intensive and intuitive time. The conventional way in which time \nhas been understood is as extensive, \u201eas a series of \u201cnows\u201d which are connected together\u201f \n(Colebrook 2002: 41). \u201eTime\u201f in this sense can be conceived as spatial; as a uni-\ndirectional line on to which time is plotted and which proceeds and passes externally to \nour bodily experiences of it. However, Bergson proposes an understanding of time as \nduration which connects temporality with memory and matter. According to Bergson, the \ncontrast between \u201eTime\u201f and duration is that while Time is measured objectively and \n 11 \nexternally (for example by clocks and calendars), duration is intuitive, a bodily knowing \n(Bergson 1999: 22-24): \n \nThere is one reality, at least, which we all seize from within, by intuition and not \nby simple analysis. It is our own personality in its flowing through time \u2013 our self \nwhich endures. We may sympathise intellectually with nothing else, but we \ncertainly sympathise with our own selves (Bergson 1999: 24-25).  \n \nFor Bergson, then, what is peculiar to bodies is that they cannot be known properly \nthrough Time but rather can only be grasped intuitively through their duration, through \nthe rhythm which endures and is specific to them. Whereas Time progresses at only one \nspeed (is divided into equally distributed spatial units for example), as becomings bodies \nhave different and multiple durational rhythms and speeds. Indeed, in Matter and \nMemory (2002) Bergson argues: \n \nIn reality there is no one rhythm of duration; it is possible to imagine many \ndifferent rhythms which, slower or faster, measure the degree of tension or \nrelaxation of different kinds of consciousness and thereby fix their respective \nplaces in the scale of being. To conceive of different tensions is perhaps both \ndifficult and strange to our mind, because we have acquired the useful habit of \nsubstituting for the true duration, lived by consciousness, an homogeneous and \nindependent Time (2002: 207).  \n \n 12 \n\u201eTrue duration\u201f, then, \u201eis not ours, assuredly, but neither is it that homogeneous and \nimpersonal duration, the same for everything and for everyone, which flows onward, \nindifferent and void, external to all that endures\u201f (2002: 207). Bodies have their own \ndurations and, further, the duration of bodies changes (contracts and relaxes), connects \nwith itself and with other durations. What also distinguishes duration from Time is its \ncapacity, or not, for division. This refers to Bergson\u201fs equation of duration with \u201eour self \nwhich endures\u201f for, while extensive Time can be divided, intensive duration, \u201eour own \npersonality as it flows through time\u201f cannot, without changing in kind.6 What duration \nsuggests therefore is an intensity which is both intuitive bodily knowledge and which is \nenduring, which might change as it flows through time but which is not extensively \ndivisible.  \n \nThe explanation of duration as both intuitive and intensive is important here insofar as it \nis the concept Grosz proposes for a re-thinking of feminist theory\u201fs conceptions of time \nand of the relations between past, present and future. For Grosz, duration is a means to \nthink through the futurity and novelty of feminist theory and to avoid linearity. Duration \nis both a method of feminist analysis (a concept through which to do feminist theory) and \na rhythm which underpins feminist politics (the rhythm peculiar to the becoming of \nfeminist politics and theory). Grosz suggests duration is,  \n \nnever either a matter of unfolding an already worked out blueprint, or the gradual \naccretion of qualities which progress stage by stage or piecemeal over time. \nDuration proceeds not through the accumulation of information and the growing \n 13 \nacquisition of knowledge, but through division\n7\n, bifurcation, dissociation \u2013 by \ndifference, through sudden and unpredictable change, which overtakes us with its \nsurprise\u201f (2000: 230; 2005: 111). \n \nAs that which proceeds through \u201esudden and unpredictable change\u201f rather than the \nunfolding of an already in place plan or a steady progression, duration is characterised by \ntransformation and novelty. Indeed,  \n \n[w]hat Bergson\u201fs understanding of duration provides is an understanding of how \nthe future, as much as the present and past, is bound up with movement and \nimpetus of life, struggle and politics. While duration entails the coexistence of the \npresent with the past, it also entails the continual elaboration of the new, the \nopenness of things (including life) to what befalls them. This is what time is if \nanything at all: not simply mechanical repetition, the causal effects of objects on \nobjects, but the indeterminate, the unfolding, the emergence of the new\u201f (Grosz \n2000: 230).   \n \nDuration, as \u201ethe continual elaboration of the new\u201f, is, for Grosz, movement, struggle, \npolitics, indeterminate emergence. However, what is crucial to remember is that although \nthere is this emphasis on the novel, duration is also what endures, what flows through \ntime. What is novel, then, is new and enduring, different from and connected to, the past. \nIndeed, as Grosz describes, \u201ethe future is the ongoing promise of both the continuity and \ndiscontinuity of duration. What endures, what is fundamentally immersed in time is not \n 14 \nwhat remains unchanging or the same over time [\u2026] but what diverges and transforms \nitself with the passage of time\u201f (2005: 110). Duration, then, is both continuous and \ndiscontinuous. Things \u201estay\u201f, they endure, not through remaining \u201eunchanging or the \nsame over time\u201f but through diverging and transforming. The following sections take up \nthis notion of duration as both novel and enduring through the girls\u201f discussions of \n\u201ethings that stay\u201f. \n \nThings that stay: \u2018shining points of memory\u2019  \nAs the earlier extract from one of the interviews demonstrates, for the girls who \nparticipated in the research, images of their bodies were produced through comments \nfrom other people, and in particular boys and girl friends. In response to my question, \nthey explain how some comments don\u201ft \u201estick\u201f while other comments, even \u201ea little \ncomment\u201f (Fay) \u201estays in your mind\u201f; \u201eyou\u201fll think about it at least every day for at least \na week and you\u201fll concentrate on it\u201f (Dionne). Comments stay, then, regardless of their \nsize\n8\n or intention; \u201ea little comment\u201f, perhaps seemingly unimportant to the person who \nmade it, can endure. The endurance of a comment that Fay and Dionne locate in whether \nit is, in my words, \u201enice\u201f or \u201ehorrible\u201f is not experienced by all the girls. Katie, for \nexample, distinguishes between nice and horrible comments but explains that \u201enice\u201f \ncomments stay as well as horrible ones: \n \nRC:  ok, so someone says something nice about you, how long do you \nremember that for? \n 15 \nKATIE:  quite a while! [laughs] A long time! But I dunno, it\u201fs more when \nthe boys say things to you, like \u201eyou look really nice today\u201f, that \nsticks with you a lot longer than when your girls, like when your \ngirl friends do, sort of the girls you just think \u201eyeah thanks\u201f but \nwhen the boys it\u201fs like \u201eyeah!\u201f [\u2026] \nRC:  and what about if someone says something bad about you, is that \nthe same? \nKATIE:  that sticks with you a lot longer, cos you just like, you keep \nfocusing, like say they\u201fve called you fat or something, like you \nfocus on that a lot longer and you\u201fre like trying to change it all the \ntime \n \nWhat I want to pick up here is not so much the distinction between nice and horrible \ncomments, nor whether it is a girl friend or boy who makes the comment, but rather the \ntemporalities of the comments which Katie, and Fay and Dionne describe as staying. In \nother words, how might the endurance of particular comments be understood through \nbecoming and duration? \n \nTasha describes the endurance of comments in a similar way to Katie: \n \nRC:  ok, so if someone says something horrible about you, kind of, how \nlong does that stay with you? How long do you think about that \nand remember that? \n 16 \nTASHA:  oh I think about it for ages, I don\u201ft, yeah cos I\u201fm really sensitive to \nthings as well so like if someone says something like tiny and it\u201fs \nnot nasty then I\u201fll get like really upset about it so, like it lasts for \nlike a long time \n \nHere, Tasha explains that a comment endures because she is \u201esensitive\u201f to certain things. \nIn their individual interviews, both Katie and Tasha explain how they were or are bullied \nfor being, in Katie\u201fs words, \u201ereally fat\u201f. Tasha\u201fs \u201esensitivity\u201f to particular comments can, \nin this sense, be understood in terms of this bullying, that is, Tasha\u201fs past produces the \nendurance of some comments. What needs emphasising here is that while the past stays, \nthis is the endurance of duration; not the unchanging over time but the divergence and \ntransformation of time. This endurance is therefore not extensive \u201eTime\u201f but intensive \nduration. Tasha\u201fs or Katie\u201fs pasts in this sense do not progress linearly into the present \nand future but rather they endure, their pasts intensify their presents and futures.  \n \nThe intensity of enduring things is understood both by Bergson (2002) and by the girls \nthrough memory. Consider for example Tasha\u201fs account of how comments endure \nthrough remembering: \n \nRC:  ok, so if, like you remember something someone said horrible, \nhow do you remember it? I mean what are you doing? \n 17 \nTASHA:  I dunno cos most days, like I do like sit in my room and I dunno, \njust think about everything that\u201fs like happened in my life and I \njust remember things then \nRC:  ok, so it\u201fs kind of at a specific time when you sit and think about it \nor is it kind of with-? \nTASHA:  well, I do think about it, it\u201fs weird, it suddenly just comes into my \nhead, I\u201fm not like doing anything to make me think of it but it just \ncomes into my head \n \nTasha here describes how memories of something horrible that someone has said \u201ejust \ncome[\u2026] into my head\u201f. She describes the \u201eshock\u201f of memory whereby she remembers \nthings when sitting in her room, thinking about her life but not necessarily about that \nspecific memory (\u201eI\u201fm not doing anything to make me think of it\u201f). The conventional \nunderstanding of memory is of the present remembering of a past event. According to \nthis view, the past remains in its place, earlier or previous to the present, and is tapped \ninto; time is therefore linear, progressive, extensive. However, through his concept of \nduration as an internal, unified and multiple flow of difference, Bergson draws attention \nto how the past endures through its mobility and dynamism. In terms of Tasha\u201fs \nexplanation of memory, the past is not what has happened to her but rather is what is \n(still) happening, what she is (still) experiencing. This is the intensive endurance of \nthings, rather than their continuation, accumulation or advancement. Enduring things are \nnot the linear progression of past events which survive into the present and future but \nrather are the ways in which certain things transform and become, that is move from \u201ethe \n 18 \npast\u201f and are re-experienced and assembled as different, novel, intensive, temporalities. \nEnduring things are not what a body has lived through but what a body is living (through) \nas non-linear durations.  \n \nThe past for Bergson exists as a series of planes which contain \u201ethe whole of the past\u201f to \ngreater or lesser extents. Grosz neatly sums up Bergson\u201fs notion of the past as such: \n \nEach segment [of the past] has its own features although each contains within \nitself the whole of the past. Memories drawn from various strata may be clustered \naround idiosyncratic points, \u201eshining points of memory\u201f, as Bergson describes \nthem, which are multiplied to the extent that memory is dilated. Depending on the \nrecollection we are seeking, we must jump in at a particular segment; in order to \nmove on to another, we must do so through another leap (Grosz 2000: 224, \nreference omitted).   \n \nThrough the notion of \u201eshining points of memory\u201f, Bergson wants to draw attention to \nhow memory works through a process of \u201elocalisation\u201f: \n \nThe process of localising a recollection in the past, for instance, cannot at all \nconsist, as has been said, in plunging into the mass of our memories, as into a bag, \nto draw out memories, closer and closer to each other, between which the memory \nto be localised may find its place. By what happy chance could we just hit upon a \ngrowing number of intercalary recollections? The work of localisation consists, in \n 19 \nreality, in a growing effort of expansion, by which the memory, always present in \nits entirety to itself, spreads out its recollections over an ever wider surface and so \nends by distinguishing, in what was till then a confused mass, the remembrance \nwhich could not find its proper place (Bergson 2002: 171). \n \nThe work of localisation, then, \u201etracks down\u201f a memory through the different planes of \nthe past by its proximity to these shining points of \u201edominant memories\u201f (Bergson 2002: \n171). The remembering that Tasha describes can be understood through this process of \nlocalisation; Tasha remembers \u201eeverything that\u201fs like happened in my life\u201f. At the centre \nof this kind of remembering is, as Grosz explains in an earlier quote, the necessity for the \npast to be entered or \u201ejumped\u201f into. For a particular memory to be sought, \u201ethe past\u201f must \nbe jumped into. To re-experience the past as Tasha describes is not to remain in the \npresent and recollect or recount the past but to \u201eleap\u201f into the past, to remember the past \nand experience its intensive temporality again.  \n \nAs such, the past is not lying latent, ready to be tapped into, or \u201eplunged\u2026as into a bag\u201f, \nbut is to be re-experienced through its intensity, through the endurance of a past thing, its \nconnection with the present and future. This connection is not a replacement of one \ndurational rhythm with another, nor a move from one durational rhythm to another. \nMoments of intense experience are not self-contained or bounded units (extensity). \nRather, the jump or leap involved in re-membering and re-experiencing a past moment is \na connection between different durations where these durations are assembled \nsimultaneously. As Bergson says, through intuition, that is the jumping into a state, \u201ewe \n 20 \ncan picture to ourselves as many durations as we wish, all very different from each other\u201f \n(1999: 47). Tasha\u201fs remembering does not involve the replacement of the one duration of \n\u201esit[ting]\u201f and \u201ethink[ing]\u201f \u201ein my room\u201f with the duration of \u201eeverything that\u201fs like \nhappened in my life\u201f. One duration cannot be subsumed by another but rather duration \ninvolves multiple rhythms, in this case of both sitting and thinking and of everything that \nhas happened. What is involved in Tasha\u201fs remembering is the connection between the \nrhythm of her present remembering and the rhythm of the past remembered. The past \nendures and is entered into, connected with, through memory. \n \nThe past and\/as the virtual \nBergson\u201fs conception of memory is elaborated further through his understanding of the \npast and present. In defining the present in relation to the past, Bergson argues that the \nusual definition of the present \u201eas that which is\u201f is \u201earbitrary\u201f (2002: 149). Instead, he \nsuggests the present is  \n \nsimply what is being made. Nothing is less than the present moment, if you \nunderstand by that the indivisible limit which divides the past from the future. \nWhen we think this present as going to be, it exists not yet, and when we think of \nit as existing, it is already past. If, on the other hand, what you are considering is \nthe concrete present such as it is actually lived by consciousness, we may say that \nthis present consists, in large measure, in the immediate past (2002: 149-150). \n \n 21 \nRather than ma(r)king the distinction between the past and the present in terms of what is \nand what has been, Bergson differentiates them through \u201ethe actual\u201f and the \u201evirtual\u201f. The \npresent involves the actual, \u201ethat which is acting\u2019 (Bergson 2002: 69) and the past \ninvolves the virtual, \u201ethat which acts no longer\u201f (Bergson 2002: 68). As it involves that \nwhich acts, the present is a duration placed \n \nboth on this side and on that, [\u2026] what I call 'my present' has one foot in my past \nand another in my future. In my past, first, because 'the moment in which I am \nspeaking is already far from me'; in my future, next, because this moment is \nimpending over the future: it is to the future that I am tending (Bergson 2002: \n138). \n \nThe past and future have different rhythms of duration which can be experienced \nsimultaneously through their assemblage in the present. As Grosz puts it, the present \n\u201estraddles both past and future, requiring the past as its precondition, while oriented \ntowards the immediate future\u201f (2000: 222-223). There is a \u201esimultaneity of past and \npresent. The past is contemporaneous with the present it has been. They exist at the \n\u201csame\u201d time. The past could never exist if it did not coexist with the present of which it is \nthe past\u201f (Grosz 2000: 223). Access to the past, and the future, are through the durational \nrhythm of the present, through the jump from the actual to the virtual: \u201ewe shall never \nreach the past unless we follow and adopt the movement by which it expands into a \npresent image\u201f (Bergson 2002: 135). The connection that Tasha makes between the \npresent and the past through remembering involves the past and the present existing \n 22 \nsimultaneously; the past is necessitated in the present, neither the past nor the present \ncould exist without the other. \n \nWhat this notion of the simultaneity of the past and the present suggests is that the \npresent is this present of this past; this present and this past could not exist without each \nother. Tasha could not remember a specific past outside of a specific present and a \nspecific present could not exist without a specific past. There is a particular and vital \nrelation between them. The present, in Bergson\u201fs terms, \u201econtains virtually within it the \nwhole of the past and present of the being experiencing it\u201f (1999: 31). Grosz describes \nBergson\u201fs understanding of the relation between the present\/actual and past\/virtual as \nsuch: \n \nEach moment carries a virtual past with it; each present must, as it were, pass \nthrough the whole of the past. This is what is meant by the past in general; the \npast does not come after the present has ceased to be, nor does the present \nsomehow move into the past. Rather, it is the past which is the condition of the \npresent, it is only through its pre-existence that the present can come to be. \nBergson does not want to deny that succession takes place \u2013 one present (and \npast) replaces another: but such real or actual succession can only take place \nbecause of a virtual coexistence of the past and the present, the virtual coexistence \nof all of the past at each moment of the present (2000: 224-225). \n \n 23 \nUnderstanding the past as \u201ethe condition of the present\u201f does not suggest that the past is \nthe pre-condition of the present; the past does not determine the present. Rather, the \nrelations between the past and present involve a \u201ecoexistent\u201f connection; the past and \npresent are the conditions of each other. The \u201ewhole of the past\u201f is this past of this \npresent, it is the virtual of the actual.  \n \nThe concept of the virtual which co-exists with the present but which the present must \nalso \u201epass through\u201f, is particularly helpful to attend to things that stay. For example, \nKatie\u201fs focus on comments about her weight which she says \u201estay\u201f longer than other \ncomments and Tasha\u201fs \u201esensitivity\u201f to certain comments might be understood through \nthis notion of the relations between the past and the present \u2013 the past as the virtual \nthrough which the present is actualised. For Katie, the past can be understood as the \nvirtual of the present in that she experiences comments about her weight intensely \nbecause of her past. In the following extract, Chloe discusses the actualisation of her \npresent through her virtual past: \n \nRC:   so do you think you\u201fre really judged on your looks? \nCHLOE:  yeah, very much so, everyone is I think but its mainly bigger \npeople [\u2026] I think being big has made me what I am, I like to \nthink I\u201fm funny and bubbly but I think that\u201fs just through, I don\u201ft \nknow, just being who I am now, just being who I was when I was \nyounger and that\u201fs just going to stay with me for the rest of my life \nso if I wasn\u201ft like this now then I\u201fd probably be a completely \n 24 \ndifferent person, I mean I might be one of those nasty people who \ntook the mickey out of people when they walk down the street so \nI\u201fm quite glad, I\u201fm not glad I\u201fve been big all my life but I sort of \nam in a way \nRC:  ok, so you think that the things that you\u201fve been through, they \nmake you think about other people? \nCHLOE:  yeah, and people who shout things out about other people in the \nstreet, they\u201fre just so inconsiderate of their feelings, see, me, I\u201fd \nthink about it, like if I was gonna shout something out in the street \nI\u201fd think about it and be like \u201eno\u201f cos I wouldn\u201ft like that to be said \nto me, so I always have to stop and think before I do stuff, cos \nbeing like, having gone through what I have it\u201fs made me think, \nwell, I wouldn\u201ft like it if it was done to me  \n \nIn this extract Chloe says that what she has \u201egone through\u201f endures into the present and \n\u201eit\u201fs made me think\u201f; her past means that she \u201ethinks\u201f before \u201eshout[ing] something out in \nthe street\u201f. Chloe\u201fs past endures through this \u201ethinking\u201f which acts as a virtual to \npotential action, stops the actualisation of potential hurtful comments (\u201eI wouldn\u201ft like it \nif it was done to me\u201f). In this sense, the virtual past conditions the actual present through \nsetting limits on what of the virtual might be actualised. The possibilities of how Chloe\u201fs \nbody might become are not endlessly open \u2013 the virtual is not a state of infinite \npossibility \u2013 but are limited or conditioned by what she has been through.  \n \n 25 \nHere, then, what is significant about \u201eexperience\u201f for Chloe is not (just) what she has \nbeen through but how what she has been through endures. This, for Bergson, is the \nduration of the present, an \u201einner\u201f duration which, while involving \u201ethat which is acting\u201f, \nalso involves \u201ethat which acts no longer\u201f.  \n \nInner duration is the continuous life of a memory which prolongs the past into the \npresent, the present either containing within it in a distinct form the ceaselessly \ngrowing image of the past, or, more probably, showing by its continual change of \nquality the heavier and still heavier load we drag behind us as we grow older. \nWithout this survival of the past into the present there would be no duration, but \nonly instantaneity (Bergson 1999: 40). \n \nThe past \u201elives\u201f through how memory endures into the present. This virtual life of the \nactual for Bergson grows \u201eheavier and still heavier\u201f as a body \u201egoes through\u201f more \nexperience. Importantly, though, this is not the past understood as the accumulation of \nexperience but as endurance, the living of the past in a virtual state. Although it is only \nthe present that \u201eacts\u201f, the past is not closed off from the present into a bounded unit; the \npast lives. As Bergson says, this is crucial to an understanding of the becoming of a body \nbecause it means that, despite a focus on the present, there is duration and not \u201eonly \ninstantaneity\u201f. Understanding a body as becoming is to \u201ebe in the present and in a present \nwhich is always beginning again\u201f (Bergson 2002: 210). But this is not to foreclose how \nthe past, or the future, is involved in this present. In understanding the present, as \ndiscussed above, as both within the present and the (immediate) future, the present has a \n 26 \nduration which is not instantaneous. This is a focus on the present that does not ignore \nhow a body changes. The past conditions rather than pre-conditions the present and, \ntherefore, the present is not always-already determined by the past, nor is the past played \nout in the present with a regularity which can be predicted in advance.  \n \nThe past that lives through memory, then, is not knowable prior to how it is actualised \nthrough specific spatial and temporal assemblages. The past that lives through memory \ncan be open, intuitive, creative. Time is not linear progression: Chloe has not become \n\u201eone of those nasty people\u201f because of the \u201enasty\u201f experiences she has been through and \nneither can the way in which she deliberately thinks in the present so as not to hurt people \nas she has been hurt necessarily be understood as the \u201ecorrection\u201f to that past. Instead, \nhow the past is actualised through the virtual as Chloe\u201fs present and future can be \nunderstood as \u201ea present which is always beginning again\u201f, as that which is \u201esimply being \nmade\u201f. \n \nIf matter does not remember the past, it is because it repeats the past unceasingly, \nbecause, subject to necessity, it unfolds a series of moments of which each is the \nequivalent of the preceding moment and may be deduced from it: thus its past is \ntruly given in the present. But a being which evolves more or less freely creates \nsomething new every movement: in vain, then, should we seek to read its past in \nits present unless its past were deposited within it in the form of memory \n(Bergson 2002: 222-223). \n \n 27 \nChloe\u201fs present might be understood as something of a mix between the past which is not \nremembered by matter but is repeated \u201eunceasingly\u201f and the \u201efreedom\u201f of \u201ecreat[ing] \nsomething new every movement\u201f. That is, Chloe\u201fs past is repeated in new and creative \nways.  \n \nThe future and the virtual in\/of feminist theory  \nUnderstanding the past as potentially new and creative has important implications for \nconceptions of the future. Indeed, in conceiving the past as the virtual to the actual \npresent, the future is a temporality which is always already involved with other \ntemporalities but is not determined by them. As the actual, the present is an unfolding of \nthe virtual past but also of the future; the future is both novel and actualised through the \nvirtual, \u201enew\u201f but also in relations with its past. The becoming of the future is thus \narranged or assembled in certain ways but is not already set out. Consider for example \nhow Sammy responds to my asking her about the future: \n \nRC:  so if you imagine yourself in the future, do you just imagine good \nthings about you, so if there was something you didn\u201ft like about \nyou know, would you think that would be gone when you\u201fre 20 or \nwhatever? \nSAMMY:  erm, I dunno, I haven\u201ft really thought about it like if things will go \nor if things will change, I haven\u201ft really thought about it  \nRC:   ok, if you did think about it now? \n 28 \nSAMMY:  erm, I dunno I suppose I do need a mirror cos then I could see \nthings I don\u201ft know, I don\u201ft actually know what I would look like, \nI just don\u201ft know cos like you know when you see your parents as \na child they look so much different to what they are now and like I \nlook more like my mum now than she did as a child \nRC:   ok \nSAMMY:  so I may change, I may stay the same, cos like she changed \n \nSammy here considers the possibilities of her future through the durational differences \nbetween her and her mother and through her mirror image. In both these cases, the future \nemerges not as an inevitable event which the past and the present lead to but rather is a \npossibility that might be anticipated through the actual present. The future, as with the \npast, emerges as virtual; it is not inevitable but neither is it completely open. What will \nchange and what will stay will be actualised through the virtualities of Sammy\u201fs mother\u201fs \nduration and through Sammy\u201fs \u201eown\u201f durational possibilities. Indeed, the way in which \nSammy thinks about her future is not as the future but as a future, a virtual future, \nanticipated by, and made actual through, this present and this past. \n \nThrough conceiving the relations between the girls\u201f past, present and future in terms of \nthe actual\/virtual coupling and duration, different ways of thinking the \u201etime\u201f of feminist \ntheory are opened up. For Grosz, duration is a productive concept for feminist theory \nprecisely because of its re-framing of how time might be thought as both enduring and \nchanging. She writes,  \n 29 \n \nAlthough there is a fundamental continuity between the past and the present \u2013 the \npresent being the culmination of the past, its latest layering \u2013 there is a \ndiscontinuity between the present and the future, for the future is not contained in \n(and thus pre-empted by) the present but erupts unexpectedly from it. Duration is \nthe movement of divergence or differentiation between what was and what will \nbe, a movement from one mode of virtuality (the past) to another (the future). \nDuration infects not only all of life, which carries the past along with its present; \nit also affects the universe as a whole. Not only does all of life proceed by \ndifferentiation, the material universe as a totality also functions through history, \nthrough deviation and surprise (Grosz 2005: 110).  \n \nWhat the concept of the virtual does, then, is understand \u201ethe new\u201f as both continuous \nand discontinuous, \u201enot contained in (and thus pre-empted by) the present\u201f but also not \ndetached from it; \u201ethe present being the culmination of the past, its latest layering\u201f. Whilst \nthe future is new, that is surprising and not contained within the past and present, novelty \nhere refers to the discontinuity and continuity of duration, to what changes and\/in what \nendures, to what of the (finite) virtual is made actual.  \n \nThrough this recognition of both novelty and endurance, Grosz suggests that \u201ethe \nopenendness of the concept of the virtual may prove central in reinvigorating the notion \nof a transgressive, radical future, a political future without specification\u201f and \u201emay serve \nfeminist, anti-racist and other political movements by making it clear that there is always \n 30 \na leap, an unexpectedness that the new brings with it, and that it is the goal of politics to \ninitiate such goals\u201f (Grosz 2000: 228-229). Taking up these points, I have argued that the \ntime and becoming of feminist theory and feminist theoretical empiricism can be thought \nas future-oriented and as unavoidably attached to the past. The concepts of becoming, \nduration and the virtual, and the \u201ethings that stay\u201f, make evident the non-linearity of time \nbut also the connections between the past, present and future. Things that stay, thought \nthrough and as duration, endure not through remaining the same but through diverging \nand transforming. The past, then, is not extensive \u2013 a securely bounded earlier time \u2013 but \nis intensive movement, assembling with future temporalities in \u201enovel\u201f ways. To \nconceive the relations between the past, present and future in this way is, as Grosz writes, \n\u201eto somehow generate a new that is not entirely disconnected from or alien to the old, \nwhich nevertheless overcomes its problems, its oppressions, conflicts or struggles (Grosz \n2000: 214).  This, it seems to me, is a necessary task for feminist theory which, by \nputting to work the concepts of duration, the future and the virtual in relation to empirical \nmaterial, this article has attempted to engage with and extend.  \n \n                                                     \nNotes \n1\n This is not a strict interpretation of Bergson\u201fs or Deleuze\u201fs work, then. Neither is it a \ntracing of the work of Grosz or other feminist philosophers and theorists. Rather, I am \ninterested in exploring some of the ways in which some of Bergson\u201fs concepts have been \ntaken up, often in relation to Deleuze, by feminist theory and, as I will discuss, how these \nmight be explored through empirical work on bodies. It is worth noting that although in \nthe arguments I focus on in this article, Grosz most explicitly engages with Bergson\u201fs \n 31 \n                                                                                                                                                              \nwork, her feminist theory is also influenced by Deleuze (see 1994, 2000 for example). In \naddition, my own research is from a feminist Deleuzian position. As such, although here \nDeleuze is a somewhat \u201eimplicit\u201f figure compared to Bergson, it is crucial to recognise \nhow Deleuze\u201fs reading of Bergson, and his work more generally, is key to the argument I \nmake.  \n2\n See, for example, Sara Ahmed (2002) who explicitly engages with Grosz\u201fs argument \nand, in particular, its privileging of the future.  For Ahmed, such a privilege is \nprovocative for feminist theory because it collapses otherness into the future and risks \nignoring the ways in which pasts \u201eare never simply behind us\u201f (Ahmed 2002: 559).  \n3 I am aware that here I am conflating \u201elinearity\u201f and \u201eprogression\u201f. My argument is not \nthat these two terms should be collapsed but rather, and in the context of my simplified \ndiscussion of feminist theory, that linearity and progress are often put together and seen \nas operating in tandom. \n4 However, see Adkins (2004) for her suggestion that McRobbie \u201ecasts the history of \nfeminism, as well as that of the history of specific forms of popular culture, in \ngenerational, familial and reproductive terms. Specifically, the passing of feminism and \nthe dynamics and characteristics of post-feminist popular culture are cast as an issue of a \nfailed reproduction of feminist consciousness, a failure of generational reproduction, with \nyounger women refusing to inherit their feminist legacies\u201f (2004: 430).  \n5 Adkins (2004) also identifies nostalgia and loss as key themes in contemporary feminist \ntheory. \n6 Consider as another example, Manuel DeLanda\u201fs explanation of colour as intensive: \n\u201eColours are [\u2026] not divisible in extension: a certain patch of material of a given colour \n 32 \n                                                                                                                                                              \ndoes not yield, when broken into equal halves, two smaller patches with half the value of \nits colour (half the hue and half the brightness)\u201f (DeLanda 2002: 69). \n7 This is division not in the sense of the division of extensive Time but the capacity for \nduration to diverge from itself and enter into different rhythms. \n8 See Edward S. Casey (1999) for an interesting discussion of the capacity of the \n\u201eglance\u201f, the quickest (smallest) of looks which nevertheless \u201ecan take note of entire \nworlds\u201f (Casey 1999: 80). Casey argues that despite its tiny size and scale, the glance can \ndisrupt linear temporality by \u201eput[ting] us both into and out of time \u2013 into an intense \nmomentary time and out of a continuous distended time\u201f (Casey 1999: 82). \n \n \nBibliography \nAdkins, L.
