Accordingly,  the  legislation  seeks  to  remove  deterrents  by\ncreating a fourth instance of discrimination, known in  Britain  as  victimisation.  The  statutory  formulas  are  sparse,\napparently providing employers no defence. Yet in some cases, courts sympathetic to the employer have  strained  the\nformula to provide what amounts to a benign motive defence.  The  result  is  an  incoherent  body  of  case  law.  This\narticle explores the problem in Britain and the United States and attempts to settle upon a new  statutory  formula  that\nwould provide certainty and clarity, as well as fulfilling the ambition of the anti-victimisation doctrine.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nSCENARIO  No.  1:  A  worker  issues  discrimination  proceedings  against  her  employer  and  pending   the\noutcome applies (unsuccessfully) for another job. Acting on  standard  legal  advice,  her  employer  refuses  to\nprovide a reference, in case anything said in it could prejudice the employer\u2019s  defence.  The  reference  would\nhave been negative in  any  case  and  the  refusal  was  not  the  cause  of  the  worker  failing  to  get  the  job.\nNonetheless, the worker sues again, this time for victimisation.\nSCENARIO  No.  2:  A  worker  issues  discrimination  proceedings  against  her  employer,   who,   following\nstandard  practice,  suspends  the  worker\u2019s   internal   grievance   procedure,   pending   the   outcome   of   the\nproceedings. The worker now sues for victimisation.\nIn these scenarios the employer has responded to legal proceedings in a predictable manner. It does not wish to  create\nevidence that could prejudice its defence at the trial, for  instance,  by  making  informal  concessions  in  a  grievance\nprocess, or omitting minor faults (relevant to the claim) in a job reference. Neither does it wish to  state  anything  that\ncould constrain its lawyers, in say, negotiation or tactics. In the second scenario, it may want to avoid  the  expense  of\nduplicative proceedings. Yet, in these scenarios, the worker is denied a reference or grievance procedure  because  she\nissued  a  discrimination  claim,  and  even  if  the  she  suffers  no  harm  by  this  (as  suggested  in  Scenario  No   1),\nother workers, having seen that normal benefits of  employment  will  be  denied,  will  be  deterred  from  making  or\nsupporting allegations of discrimination. From this perspective, policy dictates that these employers  should  be  liable\nfor victimisation.\nThe  scenarios  represent  a  universal  \u2018victimisation  dilemma\u2019.  In  the  United  States,   the   dilemma   was\ncharacterised thus:\nWe recognize the countervailing concerns in this area of the law. On the one hand, we worry that  employers\nwill be paralyzed into inaction once an employee  has  lodged  a  complaint  ....  On  the  other  hand,  we  are\nconcerned  about  the  chilling  effect  on  employee  complaints  resulting  from  an   employer\u2019s   retaliatory\nactions.[1]\nThe dilemma is one of policy. However, the courts are hampered in solving it  by  the  constrained  statutory  formula,\nwhich provides for liability simply where the employer treats the worker less favourably by reason  that,  or  because,\nthe worker has been involved in a protected activity, such as bringing or supporting discrimination proceedings. There\nis no defence. And so, on the face of it, employers should be liable in these scenarios. However, in  a  series  of  cases,\nBritish courts have sided with the employers, save where the employer has exceeded normal  practice.  In  the  United\nStates, courts have vacillated, whilst the scant case law  of  the  ECJ  suggests  that  courts  should  take  the  workers\u2019\nperspective. It follows that at least some of these decisions do not  sit  easily  with  the  statutory  formula  and  appear\ninconsistent with each other.\nThe aim of this article is to resolve, as far as possible, the victimisation dilemma. It investigates the  problem\nexposed by the body of case law in both Britain and the United States. It will explore the  dilemma,  especially  in  the\ntwo scenarios presented, highlight any technical shortcomings or triumphs of the  legislative  formulas  and  case  law,\nand  evaluate  the  policy  considerations  behind  the  legislation  and  the  decisions.  It  will  explore  analogies  with\nconventional discrimination and alternative theories of victimisation, and conclude that some  victimisation  cases  are\nmore analogous to disability-related-discrimination. Consequently  it  will  suggest  alternative  statutory  formulas  to\nresolve the shortcomings and fulfil the statutory purpose. It will conclude that  the  victimisation  dilemma  cannot  be\nfully resolved, but propose a new statutory formula with limited general and specific  defences  and  guidelines  which\nwill produce clearer boundaries and make this area of the law more predictable for employers and workers alike.\n2. THE LEGISLATION\nThe formula for victimisation is as follows:\nRace Relations Act 1976\n2. Discrimination by way of victimisation[2]\n(1) A person (\u2018the  discriminator\u2019)  discriminates  against  another  person  (\u2018the  person  victimised\u2019)  in  any\ncircumstances relevant for the purposes  of  any  provision  of  this  Act  if  he  treats  the  person  victimised  less\nfavourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat  other  persons,  and  does  so  by  reason  that  the\nperson victimised has -\n(a) brought proceedings against the discriminator or any other person under this Act; or\n(b)  given  evidence  or  information  in  connection  with  proceedings  brought  by  any  person  against  the\ndiscriminator or any other person under this Act; or\n(c) otherwise done anything under or by reference to this Act in  relation  to  the  discriminator  or  any  other\nperson; or\n(d) alleged that the discriminator  or  any  other  person  has  committed  an  act  which  (whether  or  not  the\nallegation so states) would amount to a contravention of this Act,\nor by reason that the discriminator knows that the person victimised  intends  to  do  any  of  those  things,  or\nsuspects that the person victimised has done, or intends to do, any of them.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to treatment of a person by reason of  any  allegation  made  by  him  if  the\nallegation was false and not made in good faith.\nParagraphs (a) to (d) define the \u2018protected acts\u2019. The formula provides three elements: (1) the worker  did  a  protected\nact; (2) the employer treated the worker less favourably than it treated (or would have treated) others; and (3) it did so\n\u2018because\u2019  (or  \u2018by  reason  that\u2019)  the  worker  did  the  protected  act.  In  addition,  the  treatment   must   have   been\nemployment-related.\nThe  Government  has  proposed  abolishing  the  comparative  element   from   this   definition   so   that   no\ncomparison of how other workers were treated would be required for liability.[3] As such, element  (2)  above,  would\nbe reworded: \u2018the employer subjected the worker to a detriment.\u2019\nThe parent  directives  provide  a  more  general,  but  essentially  similar,  formula.  For  instance,  the  Race\nDirective  provides  that  that  member  States  shall  \u2018protect  individuals  from  any  adverse   treatment   or   adverse\nconsequence as a reaction to a complaint or to proceedings aimed at enforcing complying with the  principle  of  equal\ntreatment\u2019.[4]\nThe federal legislation in the United States is formulated in a similar way to the UK version. Title VII of  the\nCivil Rights Act 1964 outlaws employment discrimination \u2018because of\u2019 race, colour, sex, religion, and national origin.\nIn addition section 704(a) outlaws victimisation thus:\nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees  or\napplicants for employment ... because he has opposed any practice made  an  unlawful  employment  practice\nby this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in  any  manner  in  an\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.[5]\nFor those unfamiliar with it, the  hierarchy  of  American  cases  included  in  this  article  begins  with  District  Court\ndecisions, which may be appealed to a court of  appeals  which  are  distributed  by  13  geographical  Circuits  (which\naccounts for some of the discrepancies between court of appeals\u2019 decisions). The final and  unifying  appeal  forum  is\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\nA. The Protected Act\nThe British formula covers a broad range of acts. Note the \u2018catch-all\u2019 paragraph  (1)(c).  Sub-section  (2)  provides  an\nexception only where an allegation was false and not made in good faith. The only significant case law on this  matter\nrestricts the formula in sub-section (1)(d) to allegations that actually amount to  a  contravention  of  the  Act.[6]  Title\nVII slightly looser formula simply protects those who  have  \u2018opposed\u2019  unlawful  discrimination  or  \u2018participated\u2019  in\nproceedings.6a\nB. Employment-related\nUnlike Title VII, which outlaws simply discriminatory \u2018employment practices\u2019,  the  British  legislation  specifies  the\nemployment practices where discrimination is unlawful. This includes recruitment, and in addition:\n(a) in the terms of employment which he affords him; or\n(b) in the way he affords him access to  opportunities  for  promotion,  transfer  or  training,  or  to  any  other\nbenefits, facilities or services, or by refusing or deliberately omitting to afford him access to them; or\n(c) by dismissing him, or subjecting him to any other detriment.[7]\nThis rather specific list concludes with a \u2018catch-all\u2019 phrase, any other detriment. For liability,  the  victimisation  must\nrelate to recruitment, or paragraphs (a), (b), or for a dismissal, or any other detriment. The obvious purpose of this last\nelement is, on the one hand, to catch any other unspecified treatment, whilst on the  other,  to  preserve  the  limitation\nthat the treatment complained of is employment-related.\nHowever, courts have become preoccupied with the standard of harm required to  meet  this  element.  Thus,\nthere is a class of cases where the issue of the standard of harm for liability has arisen twice: once for  less  favourable\ntreatment, and again for subjecting to a detriment.  Given  that  the  courts  in  the  series  of  victimisation  cases  each\nproceeded on the basis the denial of a reference or a grievance process fell  under  any  other  detriment,  this  element\nwill require some exploration.\nC. Less Favourable Treatment\n(i) What is Less Favourable?\nUnder the statutory formula, the treatment of the worker  must  be  less  favourable  than  any  treatment  given  to  the\ncomparator. British courts have been generous to claimants on this issue. The test is a mix of subjective and objective:\nif the claimant perceived the treatment as less favourable, and was not unreasonable to do so, then the  test  is  met.  In\nother words, it is not necessary that every reasonable person in the shoes of  the  claimant  would  have  perceived  the\ntreatment as less favourable. All that is required is that the claimant did, and that  the  claimant\u2019s  perception  was  not\nunreasonable. The following examples illustrate this point.\nIn Chief Constable of West Yorkshire v Khan,[8] the Chief Constable refused to give a reference to  Sergeant\nKhan  in  support  of  a  job  application  with  the  Norfolk  Police,  because  Khan  was  pursuing  a  claim  of   racial\ndiscrimination against the West Yorkshire Police, his current employer. Nonetheless, the Norfolk Police invited Khan\nfor an interview, but failed to appoint him. It was common ground that  had  a  reference  been  given,  containing  the\nYorkshire Police\u2019s low assessment of Sergeant Khan\u2019s managerial skills, he would have  stood  less  chance  of  being\nshort-listed for an interview. Accordingly, in Khan\u2019s action for victimisation, the Chief  Constable  argued  that  Khan\nhad been treated more, not less, favourably. The House of Lords  rejected  that  argument.  Lord  Scott  concluded:  \u2018It\ncannot... be enough for section 2(1) purposes simply to show that the complainant has  been  treated  differently.  ....  I\nthink it  suffices  if  the  complainant  can  reasonably  say  that  he  would  have  preferred  not  to  have  been  treated\ndifferently.\u2019[9] This approach echoes  the  direct  sex  discrimination  case  R  v  Birmingham  City  Council,  ex  parte\nEOC,[10] where it was held that the denial of a  grammar  school  place  (to  a  girl)  was  less  favourable  in  spite  of\nevidence that the education standards of grammar and comprehensive schools were comparable.  In  non-employment\ncases, the courts have been equally relaxed. In Gill v El  Vino[11]  a  \u2018traditional\u2019  wine  bar  served  only  men  at  the\ncounter, and provided  table  service  for  women.  The  wine  bar  argued  that  although  women  were  being  treated\ndifferently, the alternative was no less favourable. The  Court  of  Appeal  disagreed,  holding  that  women  had  been\ntreated less favourably because, unlike the men, they were denied a  choice,  which  the  female  plaintiff,  reasonably,\nvalued.\nIn each of these cases, it could just as logically be concluded that  a  reasonable  person  in  the  shoes  of  the\nclaimant would not have found the treatment less favourable. For instance, a worker may  not  have  been  worried  by\nthe refusal of a negative reference, a parent may  have  been  happy  with  the  evidence  that  the  comprehensive  and\ngrammar schools provided the same standard of tuition, and a female customer may have  been  perfectly  happy  with\nthe table service offered by the wine bar. But does not matter. So long as a reasonable  person  could  have  found  the\ntreatment less favourable (and the claimant did so), the element is met.\n(ii) The Comparison - Treated Less Favourably Than Whom?\nUntil this element is  repealed,[12]  the  comparison  should  be  handled  carefully.  The  phrase  \u2018he  treats  or  would\ntreat other persons\u2019 in sub-section (1) (emphasis  supplied)  allows  the  comparator  to  be  real  or  hypothetical.  The\nproper comparison is between the treatment of alleged victim and the treatment that was, or would  have  been,  given\nto another, who had not done any element of the protected act. It has proved rather too  easy  for  tribunals  to  assume\nthat the comparator has done part of the protected act as well, with predictable results. In Kirby v Manpower  Services\nCommission,[13] an employee at a job centre was moved to  less  desirable  work  because  he  disclosed  confidential\ninformation regarding suspected discrimination by  some  employers.  The  EAT  rejected  his  claim  of  victimisation\nbecause  any  person  disclosing  confidential  information  of  any  nature  would  have  been  moved  to  other  work,\ntherefore the treatment was not less favourable.\nIn Aziz v Trinity Street Taxis,[14] the complainant  was  an  Asian  taxicab  proprietor  and  a  member  of  an\nassociation of taxicab operators. When the association required him to pay \u00a31,000 to have a third taxi  admitted  to  its\nradio system, he felt he was being unfairly treated on racial grounds. He  recorded  secretly  conversations  with  other\ntaxi drivers, and made an unsuccessful complaint to a tribunal about the additional fee. The recordings  were  revealed\nduring the hearing of that complaint. As a result, the association expelled him on the ground  that  the  making  of  the\nrecordings was a serious breach of the trust that had to exist between members. Aziz complained of victimisation. The\nassociation argued that as it would expel any member making secret recordings, Aziz was not treated less  favourably.\nThe Court of Appeal, overruling Kirby, rejected this argument, noting that if the protected act itself constituted part of\nthe comparison all complaints of victimisation would \u2018necessarily fail\u2019 if  the  defendant  could  show  he  would  treat\nequally badly all those who did the protected  act;  \u2018an  absurd  result.\u2019[15]  The  comparator  should  be  a  non-Asian\nmember of the taxi association who  had  not  made  secret  tape  recordings.  Under  this  test,  Aziz  was  treated  less\nfavourably than this comparator.\nD. Causation - \u2018By Reason That\u2019\nPerhaps the most straightforward  interpretation  of  the  phrase  by  reason  that  came  from  the  House  of  Lords  in\nNagarajan v London Regional Transport,[16] where the majority[17] followed the \u2018objective and not  subjective\u2019[18]\nor \u2018straightforward\u2019,[19] approach, applied to the parallel element for direct  discrimination  (on  the  ground  of  (sex,\nrace etc)), where Lord Goff adopted a but for test.[20] In Nagarajan, Lord Nicholls concluded \u2018I can see no reason  to\napply a different approach to section 2 [RRA 1976].\u2019[21]  Thus,  it  seemed,  the  correct  approach  was  to  ask:  \u2018but\nfor the protected act, would the claimant have been less favourably treated?\u2019 It  will  become  apparent  below  that  in\nvictimisation cases at least, the courts have drifted away from the but for test.\n3. WITHHOLDING A REFERENCE\nThis scenario has two noticeable features. First, the employer has not acted out of malice, but merely  to  defend  itself\nin litigation. Second, the claimant apparently suffered no harm.\nIn Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan,[22]  it  will  be  recalled,[23]  the  employer  refused  to\nprovide the claimant with a job reference (which would have been negative) save it \u2018...  might  compromise  the  chief\nconstable  and  other  respondents\u2019  handling  of  the  case\u2019.[24]  Consequently,  Khan  brought  a  separate   claim   of\nvictimisation. The House of Lords unanimously rejected this claim, holding that  the  Chief  Constable  had  not  acted\n\u2018by reason  that\u2019  Khan  had  brought  proceedings,  because  the  employer  had  acted  \u2018honestly  and  reasonably\u2019  in\naccordance  with  \u2018perfectly  understandable  advice.\u2019[25]   In  coming  to  this  conclusion,  the  House  relied  on  the\ndistinction,  made  in  Cornelius  v  University  College  of  Swansea,[26]  between  a   reaction   to   the   bringing   of\nproceedings (unlawful) and their existence (lawful). 26a\nIn the US case, Sparrow v Piedmont Health,[27] the claimant worked for a nursing agency, and after filing  a\ncomplaint of sex discrimination, she requested  a  reference  from  her  supervisor,  Mr  Clark,  who  refused.  Instead,\nPiedmont wrote to her lawyer stating:\nUnder the circumstances presently existing as to the type of charge that Mrs. Sparrow  has  made,  Mr.  Clark\ndoes not feel at all comfortable with making any kind of recommendation. We would want you to understand\nthat this is in no sense a form of retaliation, since whether he makes a recommendation at all is a  choice  that\nwe feel he has. He would have no problem with a recommendation were  this  charge  not  still  pending,  but\nsince it is pending it is his feeling that  Mrs.  Sparrow  may  attempt  to  use  the  recommendation  adversely\nagainst the Agency whether it be very favourable, favourable or not at all favourable.\nAs in Khan, the reference was refused on legal advice that it could compromise the  employer\u2019s  defence.  The  advice\ndiffered slightly, because in Khan the employer was minded to provide a negative reference. In Sparrow,  the  lawyers\nfeared a reference of any sort (be it negative, neutral, or positive) could be used against the employer.\nIn the event, this refusal  caused  Ms  Sparrow  no  harm,  as  her  prospective  employers  did  not  ask  for  a\nreference. And so, like Khan, this is a \u2018no reference-no harm\u2019 case. However, in this case the employer was  liable  for\nvictimisation. The District Court\u2019s reasoning was sparse,  stating  simply  that  it  \u2018sympathises\u2019  with  the  employer\u2019s\nposition, but employers are liable if they refuse to provide a reference \u2018solely  because\u2019[28]  an  employee  has  issued\nTitle VII proceedings.\n4. SUSPENDING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES\nBefore considering how this relates to the suspension of a grievance process, it is necessary to consider the  impact  of\nthe relatively recent  -  but  transitory  -  compulsory  statutory  grievance  procedure,  which  lays  down  a  minimum\nstandard.\nA. The Statutory Grievance Procedure\nThe dispute resolution procedures are set out in  the  Employment  Act  2002,  sections  29-33  and  Schedule  2,  with\nfurther details provided by the Employment Act  2002  (Dispute  Resolution)  Regulations  2004.[29]  The  legislation\nprovides one scheme for discipline and dismissal, and a parallel one for grievances. The statutory procedure came into\nforce on 1 October 2004.  However,  following  an  unfavourable  reception,  the  scheme  is  due  for  repeal  in  April\n2009.[30] So, what follows is of limited application.\nThe statutory grievance procedure consists of three steps.[31] Step one requires the aggrieved worker to send\na written complaint to the employer. Step two is a meeting between the  two  and  a  decision  by  the  employer.  Step\nthree arises where the worker wishes to appeal against the employer\u2019s decision; here a further meeting and decision  is\nrequired. In certain circumstances a \u2018modified\u2019 procedure applies, involving just two  steps.[32]  Step  one  requires  a\nwritten complaint including its basis, whilst step two is a written response. The procedures do not apply at all  if  inter\nalia \u2018the party has been subjected to harassment and has reasonable grounds  to  believe  that  ...  complying  with  the\nprocedure would result in his being subjected to further harassment.\u2019[33]\nThe principal incentive for employees  to  comply  with  the  statutory  grievance  procedure  is  that  a  claim\ncannot be presented to an employment tribunal until the employee has sent a \u2018step one\u2019 written complaint  and  waited\n28 days for the employer to respond.[34] The sanction for not  following  the  statutory  procedure  is  a  reduction,  or\nincrease, (depending on who was at fault) of  up  to  50  per  cent  of  any  award,  as  the  tribunal  considers  just  and\nequitable.[35] Further, if the employer is at fault, any dismissal is deemed automatically unfair.[36]\nThe corresponding scheme for discipline and dismissal follows the same lines, save that step one  is  initiated\nby the employer. In cases of dismissal, the grievance procedure does not apply. Thus,  where  an  employee  considers\nthe dismissal was discriminatory, there is no need to follow the grievance procedure before presenting  a  claim  to  an\nemployment tribunal.[37] However, where  the  employee  considers  that  disciplinary  action  is  discriminatory,  the\nemployee must issue a \u2018step one\u2019 written complaint to the employer, either before  any  appeal,  or  if  no  disciplinary\nprocedure was followed, before presenting a claim to an employment tribunal.[38]\nThe essential rule here for the present purpose is that  an  employer  cannot  lawfully  suspend  this  statutory\ngrievance process. Thus, an employee who has waited 28 days after issuing  the  \u2018step  one\u2019  letter  of  complaint  may\nissue legal proceedings knowing that the statutory grievance procedure cannot be suspended  in  response.  Of  course,\nthe statutory procedures are  rudimentary,  and  fall  well  short  of  more  elaborate  procedures  used  by  many  large\nemployers, or the ACAS recommendations.[39] Thus, where an employer suspends its more elaborate  procedure  and\ncomplies only with the statutory minimum, the suspension will fall to be judged under the victimisation provisions.\nB. Suspending the Grievance Process and Victimisation\nThe various approaches to this  issue  are  represented  by  three  cases.  First,  in  Cornelius  v  University  College  of\nSwansea,[40] Ms Cornelius brought proceedings against her employer under the  Sex  Discrimination  Act  1975  and,\npending the outcome, she was refused a transfer request  and  access  to  the  grievance  procedure.  Consequently  she\nbrought a separate action of victimisation. The Court of Appeal rejected her claim for two  reasons,  the  first  centring\non the causative element:\nThe existence of the  proceedings  plainly  did  influence  [the  employer\u2019s]  decisions.  No  doubt,  like  most\nexperienced administrators, they recognised the risk of acting in a way which might embarrass  the  handling\nor be inconsistent with the outcome of current proceedings. They accordingly wished to defer action until the\nproceedings were over. But that had ... nothing to do with the  appellant\u2019s  conduct  in  bringing  proceedings\nunder the Act.[41]\nIn other words, the Court distinguished between the bringing of  proceedings  and  their  existence.  This  enabled  the\nCourt to find that the protected act (the bringing of proceedings) was not the cause of the suspension of the  grievance\nproceedings.\nThe second reason given was that Cornelius was not treated less favourably. The Court offered no  reasoning\nfor this decision, stating only, \u2018There is no  finding  that  ...  [less  favourable  treatment]  is  made  out,  and  it  would\ncertainly not be safe to infer that conclusion from the findings which have been made.\u2019[42]\nIn the US case, EEOC v Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities and University Professionals\nof Illinois,[43] the collective agreement provided a  general  policy  to  withdraw  the  grievance  procedure  from  any\nworker  who  instigated  legal  proceedings  against  the  employer.  One  Professor  Lewis  instigated   the   grievance\nprocedure because he was not recommended for tenure.  His  complaint  was  that  this  decision  breached  University\nprocedure. Lewis\u2019s grievance claim took more than a year to process. In the meantime, he issued proceedings  for  age\ndiscrimination in relation to his tenure claim, under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act 1967  (ADEA\n1967).[44] In accordance with its policy, the employer withdrew from the grievance  process.  On  Lewis\u2019  behalf,  the\nEEOC[45]  brought these proceedings for victimisation. The employer defended inter alia arguing that the policy was\ninvoked in good faith to save duplicative litigation. The Court wholly rejected this:\n[The legislation] is concerned with the effect of discrimination against employees  who  pursue  their  federal\nrights, not the motivation of the employer who discriminates. [It] explicitly  prohibits  discrimination  against\nemployees who engage in protected activity....  [A]n  employer  may  offer  a  legitimate  non-discriminatory\nreason for taking an adverse action against an employee who has engaged  in  protected  activity,  ie  that  the\nemployer took the adverse action for some  reason  unrelated  to  the  employee\u2019s  participation  in  protected\nactivity. However, the employer may not proffer a good faith reason for taking retaliatory action.[46]\nThe Court bolstered its opinion using direct discrimination as an analogy,  noting  that  \u2018an  employer\u2019s  alleged  good\nfaith is irrelevant, just as evidence of good faith has been held to be irrelevant  in  a  case  involving  a  discriminatory\npolicy.\u2019[47]\nOn a point of  statutory  interpretation,  the  Court  noted  that  the  legislation  provided  no  exceptions  to  a\nretaliation claim, such as when retaliation would be rational or financially prudent, or  in  \u2018good  faith\u2019,  or  otherwise.\nWithout a hint of sarcasm, the Court advised: \u2018If the Board wants to lobby for a benign discrimination exception ... its\nappeal would be appropriately directed to Congress rather than this Court.\u2019[48]\nA second argument, relating to  the  less  favourable  treatment  element,  was  rejected  also.  The  employer\nemphasised that the policy was not targeted at those who make discrimination claims; it was broader than that,  aimed\nat any worker who brought proceedings, whatever their  nature.  Thus,  the  employer  contended,  the  policy  did  not\ndiscriminate against those who brought discrimination claims. The Court rejected this argument:\nThe contention that the  policy  is  any  less  discriminatory  when  its  scope  is  broadened  is  unpersuasive.\nEmployees\u2019 rights under [the retaliation provisions] would be as effectively stifled under either policy.[49]\nA third argument put forward was that the difference in treatment caused Lewis no harm. The Court  rejected\nthis, largely on the facts. If Professor Lewis had waited for the year-long grievance process to conclude,  his  litigation\nwould have been time-barred. Second, his internal complaint related to the  non-adherence  to  rules  of  tenure,  rather\nthan age discrimination, so different issues were to be decided.\nThe third case  is  US  v  New  York  City  Transit  Authority.[50]  Here  the  employer  operated  a  voluntary\ngrievance procedure. However, if a complaint became  formalised,[51]  the  employer  would  transfer  it  to  its  legal\ndepartment and terminate the internal grievance procedure.\nA court of appeals held that the policy did not amount to victimisation. It declared that \u2018reasonable defensive\nmeasures\u2019 were lawful, even though they result in adverse and differential adverse  treatment.  A  decision  otherwise,\nthe Court stated, \u2018would impair the ability of an employer to place its  defence in  the  hands  of  counsel,\u2019  preventing\n\u2018the most basic precautions to defend against the claim\u2019 and the securing of  attorney-client  privilege  to  \u2018protect  the\nfruits of investigation.\u2019 Further, findings by the grievance process may be used to prejudice the employer\u2019s defence  at\ntrial. Lastly, the policy is efficient and effective because it avoids parallel  and  duplicative  proceedings.  Overall,  the\nemployer should be \u2018free to choose to act in  a  benign  and  sympathetic  way  by  satisfying  grievances  and  settling\ndisputes, or to proceed aggressively with litigation.\u2019[52]\nC. Time Bars and the Grievance Process\nThere may be tactical reasons why a claimant launches legal action before the grievance process is complete. But  one\ncommon reason will be to avoid being time-barred and  losing  any  legal  remedy.  Where  the  employer\u2019s  grievance\nprocess is likely to drag on beyond the three-month limitation period,[53]  the  worker  has  little  option  but  to  issue\nproceedings. Indeed, one reason the worker  in  the  Board  of  Governors  case  launched  his  litigation  was  that  the\ngrievance process was likely to take a year to complete. Perhaps surprisingly, the courts will not normally  extend  the\ntime limit because the claimant has waited for the outcome of the grievance process before issuing proceedings.[54]\nThis procedural restriction is highly aggravating here. Effectively, the worker may choose either an  informal\n(and presumably more amicable) solution or litigation.\n5. TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF THE CASES\nTo evaluate technically this apparent diversity of opinion in the cases, it  is  necessary  to  examine  them  element-by-\nelement.\nA. Less Favourable Treatment\nIn Cornelius,[55] the Court of Appeal ruled, albeit obscurely, that the suspension did  not  amount  to  less  favourable\ntreatment. To reach this conclusion it must have used the since-discredited[56] Kirby comparator. This is revealed  by\nimposing the correct (\u2018Aziz\u2019) comparator, that is a person who had brought no proceedings at all.  The  College  would\nnot have denied the grievance procedure to this person. The only way it could have concluded that Cornelius  had  not\nbeen treated less favourably is by using a comparator who had brought proceedings, but not for discrimination; that  is\na Kirby comparator.[57]\n               This result was achieved with  an  apparently  different  approach  to  the  same  element  in  New  York  City\nTransit.[58]  The  Court  of  Appeals\u2019  reasoning  fell  under  this  element,   as   the   employer   conceded   the   other\nelements.[59] As noted above,[60] in the court\u2019s view, it did not matter that the  suspension  could  \u2018result  in  adverse\nand differential adverse treatment,\u2019 if this was brought about by the employer taking \u2018reasonable defensive measures\u2019.\nIt reconciled these apparently conflicting statements by distinguishing between discrimination (unlawful) and  adverse\ntreatment (not  inherently  unlawful).  The  court  did  not  expand  this  logic,  and  as  such  it  appears  rather  brutal.\nHowever, imposing an Aziz comparator on the facts once again reveals that the reasoning  is  rooted  in  the  choice  of\ncomparator. An Aziz comparator would have been a worker who had not filed legal  proceedings  of  any  nature.  The\nemployer would not have suspended the  grievance  process  for  this  comparator.  Only  if  the  comparator  were  an\nemployee who had filed legal proceedings, but not for discrimination, would he have been treated the same. Thus,  the\ncourt\u2019s decision is dependant on a Kirby comparator, and the basis of its decision on this element is identical to that of\nCornelius.\nThis latent use of the Kirby comparator reveals a  good  deal  of  sympathy  for  the  employers\u2019  perspective.\nAfter all, the essence of their argument is that they are treating the (discrimination) claimant no  less  favourably  than\nthey would treat any other claimant. But there are overriding objections to this approach.  First,  it  fails  to  appreciate\nthe worker\u2019s perspective, a requirement of EC law.[61] Second, as Lord Scott observed in Khan:\n\u2018It would enable employers to victimise  employees  who  brought  race  discrimination  proceedings  against\nthem provided they, the employers, were prepared similarly to victimise any employee who had the  temerity\nto sue them for anything.\u2019[62]\nThird, as noted in Aziz, where the comparator is endowed with doing the protected act,  the  \u2018absurd  result\u2019  would  be\nthat claims would necessarily fail where the employer would treat the claimant and the comparator equally  badly.[63]\nGiven this stark choice, the better solution is to opt for the Aziz comparator, which at  least  allows  the  merits  of  the\nemployer\u2019s case to be decided under one of the other perhaps more flexible elements, rather  than  scupper  all  claims\nfrom the outset.[64]\nA different approach  is  apparent  in  EEOC  v  Board  of  Governors.[65]  A  court  of  appeals  rejected  the\nemployer\u2019s argument that as it suspends its grievance process  for  any  worker  who  files  a  complaint,  of  whatever\nnature, it did not discriminate against the plaintiff. The  comparison  with  \u2018any  worker\u2019  indicates  that  the  employer\nenvisaged  a  Kirby  comparator.  However,  as  noted  above,  the  court  of  appeals  rejected  this  argument  because\nbroadening the challenged practice to cover all workers did not change the plaintiff\u2019s position, whose rights  remained\n\u2018effectively stifled.\u2019[66] \nThe  court  is  less  concerned  with  how  the  employer  would  treat  others,  than  how  it  has  treated   this\ndiscrimination claimant. This suggests that the court is not concerned with a comparison at all. Instead, it is concerned\nwith what it perceives as the statutory purpose, which is stretching somewhat  the  statutory  word  \u2018discriminate\u2019,  but\narrives at a sensible solution, which is to jettison the comparative element and focus on the treatment of  the  claimant.\nOf course, in Britain, this may become a reality should the Government fulfil its proposal to  replace  the  comparative\nelement with a simple requirement that the employer has \u2018caused a detriment\u2019.[67] Until such a time courts should use\nthe Aziz comparator.\nB. \u2018By Reason That\u2019, Causation and Motive\nThis element was discussed explicitly in Cornelius, Board of Governors, Khan, and Sparrow (briefly); and  implicitly\nin New York City Transit. In essence, the arguments centre on a benign motive  defence.  This  was  expressed  by  the\nemployer in Board of Governors, and roundly rejected.[68] It can also be detected in Cornelius,  where  the  Court  of\nAppeal compared the employer to  \u2018most  experienced  administrators,\u2019  when  distinguishing  the  bringing  from  the\nexistence of the proceedings.[69] The House of Lords built on this logic in Khan, and ventured a step further,  holding\nthat an employer acting honestly and  reasonably  should  not  be  liable  for  victimisation.[70]  More  recently,  in  St\nHelens BC v Derbyshire,[71] the House of Lords has rowed back from this position by \u2018reinterpreting\u2019 Khan as a case\nturning on the element of any other detriment.\n(i) The Distinction Between the Bringing and the Existence of Proceedings\nThis distinction is as artificial as it sounds. Its futility is realised by adding a second protected act to the  claim,  which\ncould arise, for instance, if the claimant had \u2018otherwise done anything under or by reference to this Act\u2019.[72]  As  well\nas having brought proceedings, the claimant was \u2018otherwise\u2019 maintaining them in existence. After all,  on  the  court\u2019s\nlogic, if maintaining proceedings is different from commencing them, sub-paragraph (c) seems  the  appropriate  place\nfor such a claim.[73]\nFurther, this fine distinction between the bringing and existing of proceedings shows a  drift  away  from  the\n\u2018straightforward\u2019 approach adopted  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  Nagarajan,  where  Lord  Nicholls  said:  \u2018...  in  the\napplication  of  this  legislation  legalistic  phrases,  as  well  as  subtle  distinctions,  are   better   avoided   so   far   as\npossible.\u2019[74]\nThis distinction, which asks why the employer so acted, is based on  the  employer\u2019s  perspective.  According\nthe House of Lords in St Helens, EC law now dictates it is the worker\u2019s perspective that should prevail.[75]\nIt is artificial, unduly legalistic, and contrary to EC law. As such it serves no useful purpose.\n(ii) A Benign Motive Defence?\nOf course, what the  courts  were  trying  to  achieve  with  this  distinction  (between  the  bringing  and  existence  of\nproceedings) is exoneration for employers who  defend  litigation  in  the  normal  way.  This  is  apparent  from  Lord\nHoffman\u2019s observation in Khan:\n... once proceedings have been commenced, a new relationship is created between the  parties.  They  are  not\nonly employer and employee but also adversaries in litigation. The existence of that  adversarial  relationship\nmay reasonably cause the employer to behave  in  a  way  which  treats  the  employee  less  favourably  than\nsomeone  who  had  not  commenced  such  proceedings.  But  the  treatment  need  not  be,   consciously   or\nunconsciously, a response to the commencement of proceedings. It may simply be a  reasonable  response  to\nthe need to protect the employer\u2019s interests as a party to the litigation.[76]\nHere, in one piece of reasoning, Lord Hoffman combines the distinction with a \u2018reasonable\u2019  response  \u2018to  protect  the\nemployer\u2019s interests\u2019.\nThis approach is also apparent in New York City Transit.[77] Although the causative element  was  conceded\nby the employer, parts of the judgment suggest that the employer\u2019s motive was the real reason for the decision:\nAt some level of generality, any  action  taken  by  an  employer  for  the  purpose  of  defending  against  the\nemployee\u2019s charge can be characterized as adverse to the employee. Ordinary defensive measures  are  taken\nfor the very purpose of defeating the employee\u2019s  claim.  Even  mediation  and  settlement  are  steps  that  an\nemployer takes to promote its ultimate self-interest.[78]\nIn addition,  the  court  alluded  to  an  employer\u2019s  \u2018reasonable  defensive  measures\u2019[79]  to  prevent  prejudicing  the\nemployer\u2019s defence at trial. The judgment placed the \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019 conduct of the employer  above  any\nconsequential adverse effect to the plaintiff. None of it relates to the comparison, and it suggests that that much of  the\nreasoning in this decision was based around the causative element, despite the employer\u2019s concession.\n               This sympathy for the \u2018reasonable\u2019 employer suggests that British and American  judges  have  recognised  a\nbenign motive defence. The first suggestion of a benign motive defence in British victimisation cases arose  in  Aziz  v\nTrinity Street Taxis.[80] Here,  it  will  be  recalled,  a  taxi  association  expelled  a  member  for  making  secret  tape\nrecordings to support a complaint of racial discrimination. Although the Court of Appeal  found  he  had  been  treated\nless favourably, it then went on to hold that this was not because  of  the  protected  act,  but  because  of  a  breach  of\nconfidence.[81] On behalf of the court, Slade LJ explained that the victimisation provisions:\n... are concerned  with  the  motive  which  caused  the  alleged  discriminator  to  treat  the  complainant  less\nfavourably than other persons. In our judgment ... [it] contemplates a motive which is consciously  connected\nwith the race relations legislation.[82]\nThe House of Lords later disapproved of this quote,  but  not  the  decision.[83]  Nonetheless,  the  theme  returned  in\nKhan, with Lord Scott stating that the statutory phrase by reason that  suggested  \u2018motive\u2019,[84]  whilst  Lord  Nicholls\nsaid, \u2018Unlike causation, this is a subjective test\u2019,[85]  implying  the  defendant\u2019s  motive  was  the  key.  Elsewhere  in\nKhan, the judges used different language to express the same thing, holding  that  an  employer  acting  \u2018honestly  and\nreasonably\u2019 should not be liable for victimisation.[86]\nBut, in St Helens BC v Derbyshire,[87] the House of Lords reinterpreted Khan,  stating  that  the  honest  and\nreasonable \u2018defence\u2019  was  simply  another  way  of  expressing  that  the  worker  had  suffered  no  detriment:  if  the\nemployer acted honestly and reasonably, it could not cause the worker a detriment.[88] Only Baroness Hale was more\ntrenchant, stating: \u2018It would be better if the [honest and reasonable] \u201cdefence\u201d were laid to  rest  and  the  language  of\nthe legislation, construed in the light of the requirements of the Directives, applied.\u2019[89]\nThe flaw in the majority\u2019s logic is that in most cases an employer defending litigation will cause a detriment,\neven though it acted just as \u2018honestly and reasonably\u2019 as Khan\u2019s employer.[90] The denial of a grievance process or  a\njob reference normally will cause a detriment. If a case came before the House precisely the same as  Khan,  save  that\nthe denial of the reference did cause the claimant harm (eg because it would have been positive), a court either  would\nhave to find for the claimant, leaving  Khan  marooned  and  fit  only  to  be  distinguished  to  death,  or  find  for  the\nemployer on the basis that it acted honestly and reasonably  even  though  the  claimant  had  been  harmed.  Thus,  an\nhonest and reasonable response by an employer normally cannot be equated with causing a worker  no  detriment.[91]\nDespite the opinions in St Helens, the deciding factor in Khan was the employer\u2019s reason, or  motive,  for  acting,  not\nthe effect on the claimant, and the honest and reasonable defence survives.[92]\n               Once it is established that the decisions in Cornelius and Khan (and New York  City  Transit)  turned  on  the\nemployer\u2019s benign motive, it becomes easier to evaluate  them.  The  first  and  most  obvious  problem  for  a  benign\nmotive defence is that it does not appear in the legislation.[93]\n               The legitimacy of such a defence has often been questioned  using  the  meaning  of  the  apparently  parallel\ndefinition of direct discrimination. Here, there is discrimination if the employer treats the  worker  less  favourably  on\nthe ground of sex, or race, etc. The phrase on the ground of is the supposed counterpart of the phrase  by  reason  that.\nIn  the  United  States,  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  1964  more  simply  repeats  the  word  because  for   this\nelement.[94] For direct discrimination, a benign motive defence strictly is outlawed.  This  is  because  it  could  allow\nemployers to cite \u2018customer preference\u2019 or \u2018appeasing the workforce\u2019 as the motive for treating protected  groups  less\nfavourably.\nFor instance, in Diaz v Pan American World Airways[95] a \u2018customer preference\u2019 for female cabin crew was\nrejected by a court of  appeals  as  a  defence  to  direct  discrimination  claim  brought  by  a  male  applicant.  In  R  v\nCommission for Racial Equality ex parte Westminster City Council,[96]  the  council  dismissed  a  newly-hired  black\nworker because of pressure from the white workforce to revert to  the  word-of-mouth  hiring  practice.  The  Court  of\nAppeal found the council liable for direct discrimination. Likewise, in  Goodman v Lukens Steel[97] the US  Supreme\nCourt  found  a  union  liable  for  direct  discrimination  against  its  black  membership  for  failing  to  challenge  the\nemployer\u2019s racially discriminatory practices, even though the union\u2019s stance was not based in racial prejudice,  but  in\ndeference to its white membership, and\/or to gain favour with the employer to achieve other goals. Similarly,  the  US\nSupreme Court found an employer liable for refusing to hire fertile women on health  grounds.[98]  The  Court  stated\nthat direct discrimination: \u2018... does not depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on  the  explicit  terms  of\nthe discrimination.... The beneficence of an employer\u2019s purpose does not undermine  the  conclusion  that  an  explicit\ngender-based policy is sex discrimination.\u2019[99]\nThis was the thinking behind the but for test decreed by Lord Goff in James  v  Eastleigh,[100]  and  adopted\nfor the victimisation provisions in Nagarajan.[101] In  the  Board  of  Governors  case,  the  court  similarly  used  the\nparallel with direct discrimination when rejecting the benign motive defence.[102]\nThe point of the but for test, according  to  Lord  Goff,  was  to  avoid  questions  of  motive.[103]  But  more\nrecently, the House of Lords has drifted away from the but for test. Most notably, in  Shamoon  v  Chief  Constable  of\nthe RUC,[104] a sex direct discrimination claim, the but for test was not mentioned. Instead, the Law Lords\u2019 speeches\nasked why the claimant was treated so. What few other comments were  made  on  the  issue  suggested  that  tribunals\nshould look for a discriminatory motive;[105] and that the relevant circumstances for the comparison should be  those\nthat the employer took into account,[106] again pointing to a subjective approach.\nHowever, it is inconceivable on policy grounds that  the  House  of  Lords  would  decide  any  of  the  above\ncustomer preference or appeasing the workforce examples  differently.[107]  The  move  could  be  explained  by  the\nHouse\u2019s perceived need to loosen the shackles of the but for test in victimisation cases, thus  validating  the  decisions\nin Cornelius and Khan. The struggle with the but for test in victimisation cases  is  most  evident  in  Lord  Hoffman\u2019s\nspeech in Khan. He first stated that the causal questions in the direct discrimination and victimisation provisions  were\n\u2018not identical.\u2019[108] This enabled him to distance the but for  test  from  the  victimisation  cases.[109]  And  this  was\nbecause under the victimisation provisions, the reason for the treatment may be \u2018...a reasonable response  to  the  need\nto protect the employer\u2019s interests as a party to the litigation\u2019 which is not the same reason  as  the  commencement  of\nthe proceedings.[110] By contrast, Lord Hoffman reasoned, \u2018Under section 1 [direct discrimination], one would  have\nneeded to go no further\u2019 than establish \u2018that an employee who had not commenced proceedings would not  have  been\ntreated in the same way.\u2019[111]\nWith respect, this is saying no  more  than  that  because  the  employers  in  these  victimisation  cases  acted\n\u2018reasonably\u2019 the victimisation provisions are different and should accommodate a benign  motive  defence.  The  same\ncould be said of direct discrimination where defendants have acted \u2018reasonably\u2019 by trying to help  pensioners,[112]  or\nprotect women\u2019s fertility, or perhaps, avoid industrial unrest or accommodate customer preferences. The  shortcoming\nof Lord Hoffman\u2019s reasoning is that it does not explain why \u2018reasonable\u2019 acts of victimisation  should  be  defendable,\nwhilst  \u2018reasonable\u2019  acts  of  direct  discrimination  should  not.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  Lord  Steyn\u2019s  view  in\nNagarajan \u2018that victimisation is as serious a mischief as direct discrimination.\u2019[113]\nA more obvious difference between the formulas is that only direct discrimination  carries  specific  Genuine\nOccupational Requirement or Qualification defences,[114] tempting a suggestion that courts  should  compensate  for\ntheir absence victimisation cases.  But,  as  the  court  in  the  Board  of  Governors  case  observed,  if  the  legislature\nintended to validate victimisation where it would be rational, or financially prudent, or in \u2018good faith\u2019, or otherwise, it\nwould have expressed this.[115]  Shamoon removed one obstacle (the but  for  test)  to  a  benign  motive  defence  for\nvictimisation cases, but it did not go so far as to validate such a defence.\nThis establishes the technical objection to a benign motive defence in victimisation  cases.  None  appears  in\nthe legislation, and distinguishing the victimisation from the direct discrimination provisions cannot validate implying\nsuch a defence.\nHowever, the practical benefit of a benign motive defence is that it provides  a  compromise  of  sorts  to  the\nvictimisation dilemma. It permits employers  to  defend  litigation,  but  confers  some  control  over  their  conduct  to\ntribunals. For example, in St Helens BC v Derbyshire,[116] the employer announced publicly  that  a  minority  of  the\nworkforce persisting with an equal pay claim were likely to cause redundancies. This effective threat was intimidating\nand likely to cause the claimants fear of public odium and reproaches by colleagues.[117] The House of  Lords  found\nthe employer liable for victimisation under the SDA 1975. Lord  Neuberger  (who  gave  the  leading  judgment)[118]\nspeculated:\nIf ... the employer\u2019s solicitor were to write to the employee\u2019s solicitor setting out, in  appropriately  measured\nand accurate terms, the financial or employment consequences of the claim  succeeding,  or  the  risks  to  the\nemployee if the claim fails, or terms of settlement which are unattractive to the employee, I do  not  see  how\nany distress thereby induced in the employee could be said to constitute  \u2018detriment\u2019  ...  The  bringing  of  an\nequal pay claim, however strong the claim may be, carries with it, like any other litigation inevitable  distress\nand worry. Distress and worry which may be induced by the employer\u2019s  honest  and  reasonable  conduct  in\nthe course of his defence or in the conduct of any settlement negotiations, cannot (save, possibly, in the most\nunusual circumstances) constitute \u2018detriment\u2019 for the purposes of sections 4 and 6 of the 1975 Act.[119]\nThis employer went beyond what was \u2018reasonable\u2019 by going public with the threat,[120] and so  could  not  rely  on  a\nbenign motive in its defence. However, perhaps to escape accusations that it had created a benign motive defence,  the\nLord Neuberger has labelled  the  decision  as  turning  on  the  element  of  \u2018detriment\u2019.  As  such,  in  the  context  of\nvictimisation, the element of any other detriment and the notion of harm require further consideration.\nC. Harm, Less Favourable, and Detriment\nThe question of harm appears  to  arise  twice  in  the  British  case  law:  first,  when  assessing  if  the  treatment  was\nless favourable, and second, when assessing whether the claimant suffered a detriment. Khan and EOC v Birmingham\nCity Council show the House of  Lords  consistently  holding  that  the  treatment  is  less  favourable  if  the  claimant\nperceived the treatment as less favourable, and that that perception was not  unreasonable.[121]  However,  the  courts\nhave also applied a standard of harm to the element any other detriment. And unlike the less favourable  element,  this\nstandard has varied somewhat. The general standard required was confirmed in the sex discrimination  case  Shamoon\nv Chief Constable of the RUC,[122] where the House of Lords stated the question  was:  \u2018Is  the  treatment  of  such  a\nkind that a reasonable worker would or might take the view that in all the circumstances it was to his detriment?\u2019[123]\nIn Shamoon, one of the duties of a police inspector was the appraisal of  officers.  Following  complaints  by  some  of\nthese officers, she was relieved of the appraisal duty. She brought a claim of  sex  discrimination.[124]  The  Northern\nIreland Court of Appeal[125] held that Ms Shamoon had not suffered a detriment because she had no \u2018right\u2019  to  carry\nout appraisals and there was no accompanying loss of rank or financial loss. The House of  Lords  reversed,  and  held\nthat  the  loss  of  the  appraisal  work  was  a  detriment  simply  because  it   would   reduce   her   standing   amongst\ncolleagues.[126] Accordingly, in  Khan,[127]  Lord  Nicholls  reasoned:  \u2018I  accept  Sergeant  Khan\u2019s  claim  that  the\nrefusal to provide a reference for him constituted a detriment ... even though ... this did  not  cause  him  any  financial\nloss. Provision of a reference is a normal feature of employment.\u2019[128] Lord Hoffman  held:  \u2018Mr  Khan  plainly  did\ntake the view ... that not having his assessment forwarded was to his detriment and I do not think that,  in  his  state  of\nknowledge at the time, he can be said to have been  unreasonable.\u2019[129]  His  view  was  influenced  by  the  statutory\nprovision allowing damages solely for injury to feelings.[130]\n(i) Specific Limits to the Meaning of Detriment\nOn this element, Shamoon and Khan are consistent with each other and with the established meaning of what amounts\nto less favourable treatment. It is same mix of the subjective and objective and  does  not  require  some  economic  or\nphysical consequence. However, case law has also provided one - or possibly two - limits specific  to  the  element  of\nany other detriment which could affect the victimisation cases.\nFirst, there is Court of Appeal authority that the de minimis  principle  applies  to  the  element  of  any  other\ndetriment. In Peake v Automotive Products[131] an employer permitted female staff to leave the factory  five  minutes\nearlier \u2018for reasons of safety and to avoid the rush.\u2019 The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  this  did  not  cause  the  men  a\n\u2018detriment.\u2019 Lord Denning (who presided in Peake)  explained  the  decision  later  as  being  based  solely  on  the  de\nminimis principle.[132] To date, the Court of Appeal considers this good law. Although no  cases  have  been  decided\nde minimis, in Jiad v Byford , May LJ observed obiter that \u2018Transitory hurt feelings may not (depending on  the  facts)\nsuffice\u2019 for a detriment.[133]\nAscribing the de minimis principle to the element  of  \u2018detriment\u2019  brings  two  problems.  First,  most  of  the\nparent  European  Directives  mandate  that  there  should   be   \u2018no   discrimination   whatsoever\u2019   on   the   protected\ngrounds.[134] Thus, it is questionable if the de minimis principle is compatible with  European  law.[135]  Second,  as\nnoted by Lord Hoffman in Khan (above), as the legislation allows for damages for injury to  feelings,  it  would  seem\nthat even \u2018transitory hurt feelings\u2019 fall under this head. In Vento Chief Constable  v  West  Yorkshire  Police,[136]  the\nCourt of Appeal placed cases under the head of injury to feelings into three bands. The lowest band, for \u2018less  serious\u2019\ncases, such as an \u2018isolated or one-off occurrence\u2019 should attract awards of between \u00a3500 and \u00a35,000. In general, lower\nawards should not be made as they risk not showing a proper recognition of the injury to feelings.[137] The court  did\nnot mention if it envisaged a de minimis incident falling into this lowest band, but the reference to an isolated  or  one-\noff incident suggests that it could.\nA possible second limit to the meaning of detriment could come about if its \u2018test\u2019  (see  Shamoon  and  Khan,\nabove) were reduced to a purely objective one, and required tangible harm. This is  the  implication  of  the  House  of\nLords\u2019 reinterpretation of Khan in St Helens BC v Derbyshire,[138] where Lord  Neurberger  (with  whom  the  whole\nHouse agreed)[139] explained Khan as turning on  the  element  of  any  other  detriment.  Although  he  repeated  the\nstandard from Shamoon (above), he then stated  that  because  the  denial  of  the  reference  did  not  reduce  Sergeant\nKhan\u2019s chances, the denial did not cause him a detriment.[140]  This  suggests,  contrary  to  Shamoon,  and  indeed  a\ndifferently constituted House in Khan itself, that the matter  is  purely  objective  and  turns  on  whether  the  claimant\nactually suffered tangible harm. If this logic were taken up, all no reference-no harm cases will  fail  on  this  element,\nirrespective of any causative issue.\nThis reinterpretation of  Khan  raises  more  questions  than  it  solves.  First,  by  suggesting  that  Khan  was\ndecided correctly because looked at objectively, Sergeant Khan had suffered no  tangible  harm,  the  House  of  Lords\nignored their own opinion and ECJ authority that the matter should be judged from the worker\u2019s perspective.[141]\nSecond, the usefulness of St Helens analysis is reduced virtually to  nil  once  it  is  appreciated  that  in  most\ncases withholding a reference will harm the claimant. Normally, a reference would be positive  or  neutral,  and  so  its\nwithholding is very likely to damage the claimant\u2019s job prospects. There are less  obvious  possibilities  as  well,  even\nwhere the reference would have been negative. For instance, an employer may damage the  worker  by  informing  the\nprospective employer of the reason for withholding the reference. Indeed, in Khan, the Chief Constable  wrote  to  the\nNorfolk Police explaining that he withheld the reference because Khan had brought industrial tribunal proceedings. In\nthe US case Rutherford v American Bank of Commerce[142] an employer  was  held  liable  for  victimisation  after  it\n\u2018eliminated\u2019 Ms Rutherford\u2019s chance of employment with another bank by informing  it  that  she  had  brought  a  sex\ndiscrimination claim. This is enough  to  dissuade  many  employers  from  selecting  a  candidate.  Even  on  a  purely\nobjective test, this alone would be  detrimental  to  the  worker.  And  even  if  it  proved  not  detrimental  to  Khan,  a\nreasonable worker would be entitled to fear so, which would lead to liability under the Khan or  Shamoon  \u2018reasonable\nworker\u2019 test. It is also the case that even where the employer does not provide a  reason,  the  claimant  could  suffer  a\ndetriment simply because she would still present an incomplete application, excluding her from any selection process.\nThird, all these harmful outcomes could arise for exactly the same reason as the \u2018harmless\u2019 scenario in Khan:\nthat the employer was acting on legal advice to protect its position in the principal proceedings. As such, the  message\nsent out by Cornelius and Khan that employers may defend litigation in  the  normal  way  is  highly  misleading.  The\nlogic of St Helens places the employer\u2019s defence into the hands of fortune. The examples above show that only  rarely\nwill the claimant suffer no detriment, and where a reference is withheld, this normally will be  beyond  the  control  of\nthe employer. Harm is even more likely when suspending a grievance process[143] (which suggests the House\u2019s  tacit\napproval of Cornelius is suspect).[144]  The  irony  of  the  House  of  Lords\u2019  analysis  of  Khan  is  that  in  trying  to\nlegitimise the reactions of \u2018reasonable\u2019 employers, it has reduced their defence virtually to nil.\n(ii) Other Issues with the Harm Principle\nMore generally,  associating  the  element  any  other  detriment  with  a  harm  principle  raises  four  issues.  First,  it\noverlooks the deterrent effect on claimants. Second,  it  omits  deterrent  effect  on  other  workers.  Third,  it  restricts\ntribunals\u2019 ability to order an appropriate remedy to prevent damage. Fourth, it could produce an anomaly.\n               First, the St Helens reinterpretation of  Khan  was  described  above  as  a  possible  limit  to  the  element  of\ndetriment because on the facts before it the House of Lords found St Helens Borough Council  liable.  Yet,  just  as  in\nKhan, the claimants were not physically of financially damaged by  the  council\u2019s  public  threat.  The  decision  in  St\nHelens is better explained by reverting to the purpose of the victimisation provisions. This was articulated by the  ECJ\nin  Coote  v  Granada.[145]  Here,  Mrs  Coote  sued  her  employer  following  her   dismissal   for   being   pregnant.\nSubsequently, and after those proceedings were dead, the employer refused to  give  her  a  reference  and  Mrs  Coote\nsued again, this time for victimisation. The ECJ held that ex-workers must be protected from victimisation, otherwise:\nFear  of  such  measures,  where  no  legal  remedy  is  available  against  them,  might   deter   workers   who\nconsidered themselves the victims of  discrimination  from  pursuing  their  claims  by  judicial  process,  and\nwould consequently be liable  seriously  to  jeopardise  implementation  of  the  aim  pursued  by  the  [Equal\nTreatment] Directive.[146]\nSimilarly in the United States, in Robinson v Shell,[147]  the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  a  primary  purpose  of  the\nvictimisation provisions is \u2018Maintaining unfettered access to  statutory  remedial  mechanisms.\u2019  The  Court  held  that\nproviding a retaliatory negative reference for an ex-employee  whilst  discrimination  proceedings  were  pending  was\nunlawful. It noted that a decision otherwise would effectively vitiate much of the protection afforded by  Title  VII  of\nthe Civil Rights Act 1964, by allowing the threat of post-employment  retaliation  to  deter  victims  of  discrimination\nfrom complaining, and providing a  perverse  incentive  for  employers  to  fire  workers  who  might  bring  Title  VII\nclaims.[148]  In  both  Coote  and  Robinson,  the  central  issue  was  whether  ex-workers  were  protected,   but   the\nunderlying principle in each decision is that the purpose  of  the  victimisation  provisions  is  to  outlaw  deterrents  to\nusing the discrimination legislation.\nClearly, the claimants in St Helens could  have  been  deterred  from  pursuing  their  equal  pay  claim,  even\nthough they were caused no tangible harm. This reasoning was not apparent in the speeches as the  reinterpretation  of\nKhan  overshadowed  the  ratio  decidendi  of  St  Helens,  which,  logically,  centred  on  the  deterrent  effect  of  the\nemployer\u2019s action, rather than any notion of harm.\nSecond, a principle demanding that the claimant suffers harm, or  is  deterred,  excludes  conduct  that  could\ndeter others from complaining about discrimination (or supporting such complaints). This  has  been  characterised  in\nsome US courts as the \u2018chilling\u2019 effect of victimisation and is most apparent in the job-reference cases.\nIn the United States, the \u2018fear of deterrent\u2019 purpose articulated in Robinson v  Shell  was  presumed  to  cover\nthird parties by the reputedly progressive Ninth Circuit. In Hashimoto v Dalton[149] Ms Hashimoto made a Title  VII\ncomplaint whilst working for the Navy. After she was made redundant,  but  whilst  her  complaint  was  pending,  she\napplied for a post with the Army. Her supervisor, Lowery, provided an undue negative job reference in retaliation  for\nher discrimination complaint. However, Hashimoto\u2019s job application  failed  for  other  reasons  and  so  the  reference\ncaused her no harm. Nonetheless, she brought a subsequent case of victimisation. The  Court  of  Appeals  upheld  her\nclaim. It was concerned with \u2018... the chilling effect which Lowery\u2019s retaliatory conduct might have  on  the  remaining\nemployees under his supervision ...\u2019 and concluded that\n... the retaliatory dissemination of a negative employment reference violates Title VII,  even  if  the  negative\nreference does not affect the prospective employer\u2019s decision not  to  hire  the  victim  of  the  discriminatory\naction.[150]\nRobinson and Hashimoto differ from Khan because references (albeit  negative)  were  provided.  Hashimoto\nand Khan stand out because the workers\u2019 job prospects were not damaged. Coote is distinguishable  because  although\nthe claimant\u2019s job prospects were damaged (it was  alleged),  she  could  not  have  been  deterred  from  pursuing  her\nprincipal claim, as that had already been settled. Given that the ECJ expressed its judgment as based on  the  deterrent\nprinciple,  their  finding  for  Mrs  Coote  appears  curious.  An  explanation  is  discernable  in  the  US  case  Smith  v\nSEIU.[151] Here, the plaintiff brought discrimination proceedings against his ex-employer, a trade union. After  these\nproceedings were dead, the employer \u2018bad-mouthed\u2019 Smith in the industry, making it difficult for  him  to  get  further\nwork. He sued for victimisation. The defendant employer argued that no reasonable person in Smith\u2019s position  would\nbe deterred by this retaliatory conduct. The principal proceedings were dead and Smith  was  no  longer  employed  by\nthe union. In other words, Smith \u2018had nothing to fear, and nothing to  lose.\u2019  A  district  court  rejected  this  argument.\nCiting Hashimoto, it stated: \u2018If defendants\u2019 interpretation  were  correct,  a  retaliation  claim  could  never  arise  from\nconduct that occurs after protected activity. This is untenable.\u2019[152]\n               This gets closer to the issue. It would be \u2018untenable\u2019 if it were lawful for employers  simply  to  wait  for  the\nprincipal action to conclude, and then  victimise  the  claimant.  Indeed,  this  point  was  made  by  Lord  Hoffman  in\nKhan.[153]  The effect would be two-fold. It would punish  (or  \u2018harm\u2019)  the  claimant  for  having  complained  about\ndiscrimination, and it would deter others from making such complaints. The only \u2018deterrent\u2019 here is  to  others,  as  the\nclaimant\u2019s case has concluded. The same could be said of Coote. If - as the ECJ declared - the purpose  of  the  law  of\nvictimisation is to allay fears of deterrents, and the claimant can no longer  be  deterred  from  pursuing  her  principal\nclaim because it has been  settled,  the  only  persons  who  possibly  could  be  deterred  from  making  or  supporting\ncomplaints are other workers. Thus, it could be said logically that the decision in  Coote  did  not  depend  on  whether\nMrs Coote\u2019s job prospects actually were damaged; the deciding factor was that  the  employer\u2019s  conduct  could  deter\nothers from \u2018pursuing their claims by judicial process.\u2019[154] Focussing on tangible harm  to  the  claimant  misses  the\nbroader purpose of victimisation law, which is to outlaw conduct that could deter the claimant or other  workers  from\nenforcing anti-discrimination law.\n               A third issue arising from the requirement of harm is that it restricts remedies preventing future damage. For\ninstance, a worker in fear of her job prospects being damaged by the absence of a reference would have  to  wait  until\ndamage was done before bringing an action  for  victimisation.  In  Hashimoto,  costs  and  a  remedial  order,  but  not\ndamages, were awarded to the victim.[155] Thus, if liability depended on whether the refusal could deter the claimant\nor others from using the legislation, a  tribunal  could  make  a  recommendation[156]  that  the  employer  provides  a\nreference, thus preventing damage to the claimant and dispelling the deterrent to others. If the problem were remedied\nat this early stage, damages would be minimal.\nFourth, demanding a certain degree of harm for the element any other detriment overlooks that  this  element\nis only one of many categories of employment-related conduct which is unlawful.  Where,  for  instance,  a  case  falls\nwithin terms of employment or access to training, benefits etc,[157] there can be no workable de minimis principle:  if\nthe less favourable treatment relates to the terms of employment or training, benefits etc, the  employment  element  is\nmet. There can be no question of degree with this element.[158] The anomaly  is  that  less  favourable  treatment  that\nproduced no tangible harm would be unlawful if it related to a term or benefit of employment, but lawful  if  it  related\nonly to any other detriment. Thus, had Khan couched his claim as a depravation of  a  benefit[159]  (as  Lord  Mackay\npresumed)[160] no question of detriment would have arisen, leaving no scope for the House of Lords in St  Helens  to\nexplain the Khan decision as turning on the absence of a detriment.\nBritish courts have taken the  element  any  other  detriment  and  ascribed  to  it  various  standards  of  harm\nrequired for liability. This focus on harm resembles the question of whether  the  treatment  was  less  favourable,  and\ntends to duplicate that question, save that the limits placed on what amounts to a detriment have produced an anomaly\nand thrown up a number of problems. These limits, especially as suggested in St Helens, will: (1) only apply  to  cases\nwhere  the claim is pleaded under any  other  detriment  and  the  claimant  suffered  no  harm;  (2)  exclude  from  the\nprovisions conduct that only deters the (unharmed) claimant or other workers; and (3) in some  cases  deny  a  remedy\nthat would prevent an employer causing future damage to the claimant. Further,  these  limits  enfeeble  any  so-called\nhonest  and  reasonable  defence  because  they  render  the  employer\u2019s  defence  (of  protecting   its   legal   position)\ndependant on whether per chance the claimant suffered no harm, which in any event would be most unusual.\n(iii) Distinguishing Detrimental from Less Favourable\nAt the root of these problems is the blurring of two distinct elements. The  standard  of  treatment  and  harm  (if  any)\nrequired should belong to the element treats less favourably, whilst the element subjecting him to any other  detriment\nis concerned principally to ensure that  the  treatment  is  employment-related.  The  problem  is  the  undue  emphasis\ntowards harm given to this second element and the differing standards ascribed to it.\nA logical solution is to hold that establishing less favourable  treatment  is  sufficient  to  establish  any  other\ndetriment. However, in Khan, Lord Hoffman observed: \u2018A person may be treated  less  favourably  and  yet  suffer  no\ndetriment.\u2019[161] He explained how the absence of a reference was less favourable (because of injury  to  feelings)  but\nnot detrimental because it caused Khan no economic loss.[162] But then curiously in  the  same  paragraph  he  stated,\n\u2018But, bearing in mind that the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to award compensation to  injury  to  feelings,  the\ncourts have given the term \u201cdetriment\u201d a wide meaning.\u2019[163] Upon this, Lord Hoffman held that Khan  had  suffered\na detriment, because given his state of knowledge at the time, Khan\u2019s view that he had suffered  a  detriment  was  not\nunreasonable.[164] The matter was further confused by the analysis of Khan by a differently constituted  House  in  St\nHelens, who considered that Sergeant Khan had not suffered  a  detriment.[165]  This  confusion  alone  is  enough  to\nsupport an equalising of standards. And with respect to Lord Hoffman, to layperson and lawyer alike, the  notion  that\nthe same treatment is less favourable but not detrimental is anomalous, confusing,[166] and shows another drift  away\nfrom the \u2018straightforward\u2019 approach urged by the House of Lords in Nagarajan.[167]\nAlthough an equalising of standards is a logical solution, it is also a distraction from  the  proper  function  of\nthis element, which is ensuring that treatment was work-related. For claims falling under any other detriment, liability\nshould depend upon whether there was work-related less favourable treatment on a prohibited ground (in this  context\na protected act). The practical solution  for  claimants  is,  where  possible,  to  plead  a  case  under  one  of  the  other\n\u2018employment-related\u2019 headings, such as other benefits. For this  purpose,  references[168]  and  grievance  procedures\nshould be considered benefits of employment.\nThis American approach is more clear-cut. In its most recent pronouncement on  victimisation,  the  Supreme\nCourt, in  Burlington Northern v White,[169] addressed  the  two  elements  separately:  first,  holding  that  the  range\nemployment-related treatment was not confined just to altering the terms of employment;[170] and second, explaining\nthe degree of harm required for liability (the less favourable question).[171]\nA change of approach will be forced upon the British courts  should  the  Government  fulfil  its  proposal  to\nabolish the comparative element (less favourable treatment) and replace it with \u2018subjected to a  detriment\u2019.[172]  This\nwould bring the victimisation provisions in discrimination law into  line  with  the  growing  number  of  victimisation\nprovisions provided by Part V of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which cover areas such as  whistle  blowing,  jury\nservice, health and safety, Sunday working, family leave, and working time rights.\nWhilst the disposal of the comparative element and any anomalies between less favourable and  detriment  is\nwelcome, the danger is that it permits courts more discretion on what standard of harm is required for  liability.  If  the\ncourts import the limited meaning of detriment (incorporating say,  de  minimis  and  the  St  Helens  \u2018objective  harm\u2019\nstandard), the limits will apply to all employment victimisation claims, rather than just those falling  under  the  catch-\nall phrase any other detriment. Thus, the benefit of losing any anomalies is offset by the more restrictive  regime.  The\nscant case law on this phrase in the Employment Rights Act points to this outcome. In Harrow LB v  Knight,[173]  Mr\nRecorder Underhill QC ruled that the claimant should have suffered \u2018some identifiable detriment\u2019,[174] suggesting an\n\u2018objective harm\u2019 standard.\n               A better amendment would be to replace the comparative element with the phrase treats  unfavourably.  This\nshould  be  accompanied  by  a  replacement  of  the  phrase  any  other  detriment  with   a   \u2018catch-all\u2019   phrase   other\nemployment-related  treatment,[175]  thus  signalling  that  its  purpose  merely  is  to  ensure  that   the   unfavourable\ntreatment was employment-related. Of course, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be  better  if  these  purposes  were\nspelt out. Unless otherwise expressed in the legislation, this will catch cases where the claimant is harmed or deterred,\nor where third parties are deterred.\n6. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS - THE VICTIMISATION DILEMMA\nThe case law signals that both employer and worker have a claim on the court\u2019s sympathy. The prominent polices  are\nto preclude deterrents to using the discrimination legislation, and to allow employers to  defend  litigation.  The  cases\nshow that these aims often conflict and a benign motive defence (however it is dressed-up) provides a compromise.\nThe employer facing litigation from  a  worker  is  in  a  difficult  position.  At  some  stage  in  litigation  the\nemployer will treat the claimant less favourably than it would treat a  person  who  has  brought  no  proceedings.  For\nexample, no one would suggest that a tribunal should excuse a claimant or  her  witnesses[176]  from  rigorous  cross-\nexamination. If the employer must treat the litigant as it would treat a person who had not brought proceedings of  any\nnature, the logical conclusion is that the employer cannot defend its case. By default the employer would lose most,  if\nnot all, claims of victimisation.\nSympathy for this perspective was cogently expressed by Lord Scott in Khan  who  stated  that  an  employer\nwould \u2018otherwise be placed...in an unacceptable  Morton\u2019s  fork.\u2019[177]  It  was  robustly  expressed  by  Circuit  Judge\nJacobs in New York City Transit, who declared  that  employers  should  be  \u2018free  to  choose  to  act  in  a  benign  and\nsympathetic way by satisfying grievances and settling disputes, or to proceed aggressively with litigation.\u2019[178]\nOn the other hand, focussing on the predicament of the employer undermines  the  policy  of  the  provisions,\nwhich is to preclude deterrents to the enforcement of the anti-discrimination  legislation.  This  means  looking  at  the\nconduct from the perspective of the workers, and was advanced with some force in St Helens, citing ECJ authority  on\nthe matter.[179]  In  Khan,  the  Law  Lords\u2019  speeches  are  replete  with  statements  sympathetic  to  the  employers\u2019\ndilemma. Nowhere did a judge express sympathy for the workers whose reference is withheld; as well as having acted\njust as \u2018honestly and  reasonably\u2019  as  the  employer,  these  workers  will  have  their  career  frozen  for  the  duration\n(conceivably several years) of the proceedings, simply because they complained of discrimination. This approach also\nplaces the worker in an \u2018unacceptable Morton\u2019s fork\u2019, choosing to suffer either discrimination or a  frozen  career.   In\ncases of suspended grievance processes, the worker loses the chance of an informal resolution to a complaint,  instead\nhaving the choice of the costs, time and stress of formal proceedings, or  dropping  the  complaint  altogether.  Indeed,\nwhere the grievance process is likely to exceed the  limitation  period,  the  worker\u2019s  hand  is  forced.[180]  A  further\npotential disadvantage with suspending the grievance process  is  that  the  worker\u2019s  opportunity  to  have  unlitigated\nmatters resolved may be lost altogether.[181]\nThese competing interests should be a matter for Parliament to resolve, within the bounds  of  the  \u2018deterrent\u2019\nprinciple set out by the ECJ in Coote. As such, employers should given all possible  scope  to  defend  litigation,  save\nwhere it injures or deters the claimant, or deters other employees.[182]\n7. ALTERNATIVE THEORIES\nThe consistent factor in the Khan and St Helens judgments is the  House  of  Lords\u2019  sympathy  with  the  \u2018honest  and\nreasonable\u2019 employer\u2019s dilemma. The distinction between the bringing and existence of proceedings,  the  honest  and\nreasonable \u2018defence\u2019, and the  finding  of  no  tangible  detriment,  were  all  vehicles  to  deliver  this  sympathy.  The\nreasoning  carries  technical  flaws,  the  essence  of  which  is  that  the  statutory  formula  carries  no  scope  for  this\nsympathy.  If,  as  suggested,  policy  dictates  that  employers  should  have  some  scope  to  defend  proceedings,  an\nalternative theory of victimisation is required.\nA. Parallels with Direct and Indirect Discrimination\nIn both Nagarajan and the Board of Governors, one reason for rejecting the benign motive defence  was  the  analogy\nwith the \u2018parallel\u2019 provision of direct discrimination, where such a defence strictly is outlawed.  Only  Lord  Hoffman,\nin Khan, attempted  openly  to  distinguish  the  direct  discrimination  and  the  victimisation  formulas,  although  his\nreasoning was unconvincing.[183] Lord Hoffman overlooked a significant difference between the two formulas:  only\ndirect discrimination carries specific Genuine Occupational Requirement defences. As such, the victimisation formula\nis more restrictive, as the legislature has provided no defence, specific or general.\nHowever, the employer\u2019s predicament provides a clue to a more fundamental flaw in an analogy  with  direct\ndiscrimination. The employer\u2019s argument in defence of its policy to deny a reference or grievance process is two-fold.\nFirst, it wants to defend its case properly. Second, it is a general policy that does not single out those who complain of\ndiscrimination. This second argument provides the clue. If the policy is of general application, then it is  arguable  that\nit is neutral on its face.  This  makes  it  more  akin  to  indirect  discrimination,  which,  of  course,  carries  a  general\njustification defence, which would accommodate an employer\u2019s benign motive. In the US case, EEOC v  Huber,[184]\na worker sued for discriminatory dismissal,  seeking  reinstatement.  Her  employer  withheld  her  retirement  benefits\nbecause she sought reinstatement. This was because if the employer paid benefits to persons while the validity  of  her\ndismissal was uncertain and who had a realistic possibility of being reinstated, the tax-exempt status of the plan  could\nbe lost for all participants. This was the policy for all dismissed workers who sought reinstatement, not just  for  those\nwhose claims were based on discrimination.[185] The court held that the policy was permissible because:\n[G]iven Huber\u2019s fiduciary obligations to the other plan participants, the  policy  of  withholding  benefit  plan\nfunds is not facially pretextual and appears to be significantly related to a legitimate business concern.[186]\nThe  court  embraced  the  employer\u2019s  \u2018benign  motive\u2019  defence  by  treating  the  case  as  one   of   indirect\ndiscrimination. This was achieved by analysing the policy as  a  facially  neutral  one,  which  affected  any  dismissed\nworker seeking reinstatement.[187]\nThis is an  attractive  approach  which  equally  could  be  applied  to  Cornelius,  Khan,  Sparrow,  Board  of\nGovernors, and New York City Transit, because, as in  Huber,  general  policies   to  suspend  a  grievance  process  or\nwithhold a reference would affect all workers who issued proceedings, not just those claiming discrimination. But this\nconclusion starkly contrasts with the analysis in Board of Governors, which reasoned that \u2018broadening\u2019 a policy made\nit no less effective against the plaintiff who had brought a (protected) discrimination claim.\nSo, here are two apparently logical conclusions that conflict. Any reconciliation  comes  from  understanding\nthat each is half-right. Huber may appear to be an unconventional decision, but in fact  it  perpetuates  the  notion  that\ndiscrimination and victimisation are parallel concepts, which facilitates the direct\/indirect discrimination  analysis  for\nvictimisation cases. The error with this analysis is that in most conventional discrimination cases there  is  a  protected\nclass identifiable by one single characteristic, be it sex, sexual  orientation,  religion,  or  race,  etc.  Normally,  it  is  a\nstraightforward task to distinguish a facially discriminatory from a facially neutral practice.[188] The  reason  for  this\nis that the protected class is easily identified by a single factor, be it the sex, sexual  orientation,  religion,  or  race,  of\nthe claimant. By contrast, the protected persons in victimisation  cases  are  identified  by  what  they  have  done:  the\nprotected activity. And in the instant cases, the protected activity  requires  two  factors  to  be  identified:  (1)  issuing\nproceedings and (2) for discrimination.[189] The challenged practice, triggered  by  just  \u2018issuing  proceedings,\u2019  is  in\npart,  facially  neutral  and  in  part  facially  discriminatory,  as  in  these  cases  the   nature   of   the   proceedings   is\ndiscrimination. So Huber was half right in identifying claiming reinstatement as the (facially  neutral)  ground  of  the\nretaliation, and  Board  of  Governors  was  half  right  when  identifying  an  age  discrimination  complaint  (facially\ndiscriminatory) as the ground for the  retaliation.  The  court  in  Huber  omitted  the  facially  discriminatory  element\nwhilst in Board of Governors it omitted the facially neutral element. For victimisation, the distinction  between  direct\nand indirect discrimination becomes \u2018fuzzy at the border\u2019[190] and analogies with director or  indirect  discrimination\ntheory are not particularly rational or helpful.\nB. Parallels with Disability-Related Discrimination - Victimisation by Proxy\nA more appropriate and useful analogy can be made  with  disability  discrimination,  which  has  its  own  solution  to\n\u2018fuzzy border\u2019 cases. Disability discrimination is prone to these \u2018fuzzy  border\u2019  cases  because  frequently  apparently\nneutral policies are directed at a manifestation of a  disability,  rather  than  the  disability  itself.  Examples  include  a\nrestaurant\u2019s no dogs rule,[191] or the dismissal of any worker on long-term sick leave[192] or of postal  workers  who\nwalk slowly, or of typists who produce misspelt letters.[193]\nThese examples compare with some victimisation cases, where the employer\u2019s  apparently  neutral  policy  is\ndirected at a manifestation of the worker\u2019s protected act (proceedings) rather than the nature of the act (discrimination\nor harassment). These cases are also on the fuzzy border between direct and indirect discrimination.[194]\nThe  solution  for  disability  law  is  provided  by  an  additional  model  of  discrimination.   The   Disability\nDiscrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) provides a hybrid theory of  disability-related  discrimination.[195]  Under  the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act 1990, the  US  courts  developed  a  similar  hybrid  model:  direct  discrimination  by\nproxy.[196] Either variety comes with a justification defence.[197] In  a  similar  way,  some  victimisation  cases  are\nmore accurately analysed as protected act-related  discrimination,  or  less  awkwardly,  victimisation  by  proxy.  The\nmanifestation of the protected act is the issuing of legal proceedings, which is the target of the  employer\u2019s  retaliatory\npolicy. But the policy is related to the  protected  act,  and  so  should  attract  scrutiny  under  the  victimisation  laws.\nAlthough this theory provides a neater analysis of these victimisation cases, its chief attraction, and  perhaps  practical\nbenefit, is its justification defence.\n(i) The Justification Defence\nThe next issue is defining the justification defence for this purpose. Under the DDA  1995,  the  defence,  provided  in\nJones v Post Office,[198] is somewhat lax and anomalous, requiring only that the employer  acted  within  a  range  of\nreasonable responses.[199] This laxity does not present such a problem in disability  law  because  in  most  cases  the\nemployer would also have a duty to make reasonable adjustments, nonetheless, the Government plans  to  replace  this\ndefence with the standard \u2018proportionate means of achieving  a  legitimate  aim\u2019  formula.[200]  Therefore,  the  better\npath is to avoid the anomalous Jones formula. This still leaves a number of options.\nThe standard justification formula  -   used  in  equal  pay  and  indirect  discrimination  cases  -  requires  the\nemployer to show that the  policy  is  genuine  (legitimate  aim),  appropriate  and  necessary  (proportionate).  This  is\nknown as the \u2018Bilka test\u2019.[201] The formula requires the aim to be \u2018irrespective\u2019 of  the  protected  ground,  eg  sex  or\nrace etc.[202] Here, because the prime facie victimisation is related to a protected act, the defence  cannot  necessarily\nbe \u2018irrespective\u2019 of the protected act - by its nature, the defence must have more  leeway  than  usual.  Nevertheless,  it\nshould be able to be applied with some coherence, as the \u2018legitimate aim\u2019 should be related to  the  \u2018manifestation\u2019  of\nthe  protected  act,  such  as  legal  proceedings,  whatever  their  nature.  If  the  aim  were  related  to  the   nature   of\ndiscrimination proceedings (eg sex or race etc), then there  should  be  liability  under  \u2018direct\u2019  victimisation,  or  even\ndirect (eg sex or  race) discrimination.\nTake the scenarios where the employer has suspended a grievance process  or  denied  a  reference,  with  the\nstated aim of defending itself in the forthcoming trial. This response is likely to be genuine if  it  is  no  more  than  an\ninvocation of a general policy that applies across a class of cases, not just discrimination ones. If it  were  invoked  for\nthe first time in a discrimination case, it would be suspicious.[203]\nThe response should be appropriate. This rules out underhand or even illegal tactics (and so in part  coincides\nwith the honest and reasonable test.) Two American cases illustrate this. In Berry v Stevenson Chevrolet[204] a  sales\nmanager paid his salesman their  due  bonuses  out  of  his  own  pocket,  and  later,  when  the  manufactures\u2019  cheque\narrived, he forged a signature and cashed it for himself. His employer discovered the forgery and formed a  reasonable\nsuspicion that the manager had committed a fraud. Later, the manager sued  for  racial  discrimination.  The  employer\nretaliated by reporting the suspected fraud to the police. The manager was acquitted of any criminal  wrongdoing  and\nhis claim for victimisation succeeded. Similarly, in Rochon v Gonzales,[205] the FBI was held to  have  victimised  an\nagent (who had previously complained of  racial  harassment)  by  refusing,  contrary  to  policy,  to  investigate  death\nthreats a federal prisoner made against the agent and his wife. The conclusion reached by  the  House  of  Lords  in  St\nHelens also accords with this analysis, as the employer acted inappropriately by \u2018going public\u2019.\nThe response should also be necessary to achieve the aim. An employer cannot try to  win  at  all  costs.  The\nindications from Cornelius, Khan, and St Helens, are that the employer is permitted to do what the  courts  consider  is\nnormal legal practice. A further consideration at the \u2018necessity\u2019 stage is  weighing  the  employer\u2019s  needs  against  the\nharm done, such as damage to the claimant, and\/or the deterrent effect on the claimant and others.\nThis provides a neat, technically sound solution that restores some logic and certainty to the law. Its  merit  is\nthat it would encompass all genuine and proportionate reactions to litigation, even those undreamt  of,  or  not  strictly\nrelated to defending the claim, such as in Huber.205a This would allow the courts  -  legitimately  -  to  evaluate  each\ndefence on its merits according to known and predictable criteria.\nThere would remain less predictable borderline cases, such as where issues  other  than  those  litigated  were\nalso part of the grievance (Board of Governors).[206]  On  the  face  of  it,  a  denial  of  a  grievance  process  for  the\nunlitigated matters would appear disproportionate. But an employer may show that  it  is  impossible  to  untangle  the\nfacts relating to both matters and so a grievance process for the unlitigated matter could compromise its defence of the\nlitigated matter. Here, at least the parties would know  by  what  criteria  the  matter  would  be  judged,  unlike  at  the\npresent, where, unpredictably, the matter could be turn on defences such as reacting to  the  existence  rather  than  the\ncommencement of proceedings, or not causing a detriment (varying standards), or acting honestly and reasonably.\nThe demerit of this general justification defence is that it would hand to the courts formally a discretion  over\npolicy and could  legitimise  other  undreamt-of  or  pernicious  arguments  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  defending\nlitigation. Indeed the Court of Appeal in St Helens accepted that the employer had acted  honestly  and  reasonably  by\nmaking its \u2018effective threat\u2019 to the claimants.206a  Alternatively,  an  employer  may  argue  it  defends  ruthlessly  all\nworker-litigation whatever its merit just to signal that it is not a soft touch, an aim barely related (if at all)  to  any  one\nparticular claim. Of course, such an aim defeats the  \u2018deterrent\u2019  purpose  of  the  victimisation  law,  but  this  purpose\ncould become lost (as it was inter alia in St Helens206b) in a general justification defence. This prompts a notion of  a\nnarrower justification defence,  confined  to  defending  the  claimant\u2019s  litigation.  But  this  would  exclude  defences\nworthy of consideration, such as that in Huber, and so should be discarded.\nA further objection to a defence rooted in Bilka is  that  the  starting  point  for  objective  justification  is  the\nemployer\u2019s goal. As such, it reverses the principle advanced in  Coote  v  Granada,[207]    that  the  matter  should  be\nviewed from the workers\u2019 perspective. So, for instance, an employer arguing that things said  in  a  grievance  hearing,\nor job reference, may prejudice its defence at trial, is doing so from its perspective. Such evidence may  prejudice  the\nemployer\u2019s defence, but it may not necessarily prejudice the trial  or  justice  per  se.  This  leaves  the  court  with  the\ndiscretion of deciding how much leeway the employer should be given, a situation once again leading  to  uncertainty.\nFor  instance,  the  leeway  suggested  in   New   York   City   Transit   (employers   should   be   \u2018free   to   ...   proceed\naggressively\u2019)[208]  goes further than that suggested in Khan (\u2018honest and reasonable\u2019). And in St Helens, honest  and\nreasonable meant something quite different to the Court of Appeal than it did to the House of Lords. As such,  it  may\nbe better to enact some more specific exceptions, in a similar  way  to  the  Genuine  Occupational  Requirements  laid\ndown for direct discrimination. Parliament should decide policy  and  expressly  permit  or  outlaw  specific  reactions\nsuch as suspending a grievance process and withholding a reference. The  general  doctrine  of  the  parent  Directives\nwould ensure that any exceptions should be genuine, and applied proportionately.\nThus, the optimum solution is to combine the objective justification defence  with  some  specified  examples\nof what is and what is not permissible. This allows Parliament to dictate policy while leaving scope for unpredicted or\ninnovative defences to be assessed by common criteria.\n(ii) One or Two Cause of Action?\nThere  remains  the  question  of  whether  victimisation  by  proxy  should  stand  as  the  only  cause   of   action   for\nvictimisation, or be in addition  to  the  existing  \u2018direct\u2019  victimisation  provision.  If  it  were  the  only  option,  every\ndefendant would have a chance to justify its conduct, no matter how pernicious the retaliation. For the sake of  clarity,\nit would be better to preserve the original provision - \u2018direct  victimisation\u2019  -  with  the  suggested  amendments,[209]\naccompanied by guidance, similar to that provided for direct discrimination in  the  DDA  1995,[210]  confining  it  to\nwhere the unfavourable treatment was in response to the protected act, rather than a manifestation of it.\nA technical concern here is that it is hard to imagine a case like this (where the defendant\u2019s  motive  included\nthe discrimination element of the protected act) that does  not  amount  also  to  a  case  of  direct  discrimination.  For\ninstance, an employer who singles out for victimisation a worker who complains of racial discrimination is  acting  on\nthe  ground  of  race,  even  where  that  worker  complained  on  behalf  of  a  colleague.  This  implies  that  a   direct\nvictimisation provision would be redundant. However, this coincidence will be  less  common  in  cases  where  direct\ndiscrimination must on the ground of the complainant\u2019s sex, or gender reassignment,  or  age,  or  disability.[211]  For\nexample, an employer may deny a pay rise to a male worker  for  giving  evidence  in  support  of  female  colleague\u2019s\nsexual harassment complaint. The victimisation was not on the ground of the witnesses\u2019 sex and so could  not  amount\nto direct sex discrimination under the present definition. Thus, a direct victimisation provision should be preserved for\nthese grounds at least, and to avoid any undreamt-of cases escaping liability, it would be better to preserve it in all the\nstatutes.\n8. RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Reframe the existing victimisation definition, with the qualification  that  it  applies  only  to  \u2018direct\u2019  victimisation.\nGuidance on this should be provided in a similar way to that provided for direct discrimination under the  DDA  1995.\nIn addition, the comparative element should be repealed as planned, but replaced with treats unfavourably, rather than\nthe planned cause a detriment.\n2. Enact an additional cause of action: victimisation by proxy, with a general justification defence based  on  the  Bilka\nmodel, but with some defences specified as lawful or unlawful.\n3. The purpose of the provisions should be expressed in the legislation, which is to  ensure  that  workers  can  enforce\nthe discrimination legislation without fear  of  deterrents.  These  workers  include  complainants,  those  who  support\nthem, and third parties who could be deterred  from  making  or  supporting  complaints  in  the  future.  For  example,\nwhere other workers could be deterred by the employer\u2019s action, it is not necessary for the claimant to suffer  tangible\nharm for liability.[212] This allows a tribunal to order that the employer cease  the  challenged  practice,  and  provide\ncosts for the claimant.\n4. Replace the phrase any other detriment in the employment sections  with  a  \u2018catch-all\u2019  phrase  other  employment-\nrelated treatment.\n5. Consider reversing the time-bar rule in Robinson v Post Office,[213] and enact a rule that time begins to run  in  the\nnormal way after the grievance process has been exhausted.[214]\n9. CONCLUSION\nThe two scenarios, and the variations discussed, are representative of the victimisation dilemma. The US  cases  show\nthat this is not a peculiarly British problem. At present, the constrained statutory formula provides no  leeway  for  the\nemployer\u2019s position.  Yet  courts  sympathetic  to  employers  have  dictated  policy  and,  under  a  variety  of  guises,\nprovides employers with a benign motive defence. This has produced an incoherent  and  technically  flawed  body  of\ncase law. In essence, the courts have produced  an  honest  and  reasonable  defence  (which  does  not  appear  in  the\nlegislation), and fallacious notions that reasonable conduct will rarely cause a detriment, or that there  is  a  substantial\ndifference between the bringing and the existence of proceedings. Further, there  has  been  covert  use  of  the  flawed\nKirby comparison. The fault does not lie entirely with the courts. They have been compelled to squeeze a broad  range\nof cases into a single narrow statutory formula, which does not envisage the more subtle facts represented by  the  two\nscenarios.\nAt  the  heart  of  the  problem  is  the  constrained  statutory  formula  and  absence  of  policy  expressed  by\nParliament. The law of victimisation requires redefining to recognise  different  classes  of  victimisation  and  provide\nleeway for employers to defend litigation, but under a predictable  and  controlled  regime.  The  predictability  would\nbenefit employers and claimants alike.\n               This article poses more policy questions than it solves. But these questions are likely to require  solutions  in\nany case. It would be better for Parliament to do this than the courts to carry on ad hoc under  a  constrictive  statutory\nformula. Parliament can decide more precisely where the line should be  drawn  between  the  conflicting  interests.  It\ncan research and single out particular scenarios and designate particular responses  as  lawful  or  unlawful.  However,\nthe overriding principle in this exercise must be the purpose of this law, which is to ensure  that  workers  can  enforce\nthe discrimination legislation without fear of deterrents.\nThe tension, between this principle and an employer\u2019s right to defend litigation, is not fully resolvable. But  a\nnew regime would at least  ease  the  tension  somewhat  by  defining  policy  and  providing  clearer  and  predictable\nboundaries.\n-------------------------------------------\n( University of Surrey.\n[1] Circuit Judge Kozinski, Brooks v San Mateo 229 F 3d 917, 928 (9th Cir 2000).\n[2] Similar definitions  are  provided  in  the  parallel  legislation:  Sex  Discrimination  Act  1975,  s  4;  Employment\nEquality (Religion or  Belief)  Regulations  2003  SI  2003\/1660  reg  4;  Employment  Equality  (Sexual  Orientation)\nRegulations 2003 SI 2003\/1661 reg 4; Employment Equality (Age Regulations) 2006 SI 2006\/1031, reg  4;  Disability\nDiscrimination Act 1995, s 55; Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998 (Northern Ireland) SI 1998\/3162, art 3.\n[3] See the consultation paper \u2018Discrimination Law Review.

The grievance procedure, by its nature, is a remedy for a prior  decision,  not  an\nopportunity to influence that decision before it is made. ... we already have held that the pendency of  a  grievance,  or\nsome other method of collateral review  of  an  employment  decision,  does  not  toll  the  running  of  the  limitations\nperiods.

The decision  is  easily  explained  in  the  United  States,  because  it  is\nunlikely that the breach of confidence would be regarded as  a  protected  act,  permitting  a  linguistically  neater  -  if\nsubstantially the same - solution: see Hochstadt v Worcester Foundation  for  Experimental  Biology,  545  F  2d  222,\n228, 230 & 233 (1st Cir 1976). In the UK, the courts have less latitude, as an act is  unprotected  only  if  it  is  a  false\nallegation and not made in good faith. This makes it more  difficult  to  separate  the  breach  of  confidence  from  the\ncollecting of evidence. See Aziz [1989] QB 463,  479  (holding  that  the  secret  recording  was  a  protected  act)  and\nConnolly, M, \u2018Race, gender and mens rea\u2019 [2001] 06\/2 JO CIV LIB 150.\n[84] [2001] ICR 1065, [77].\n[85] Ibid, [29].\n[86] \u2018Employers, acting reasonably and honestly, ought to be able to take steps to preserve  their  position  in  pending\nproceedings without laying themselves open to a charge of victimisation.\u2019  Ibid  [31]  (Lord  Nicholls).  Lord  Mackay\nnoted (ibid [44]) that the Chief Constable \u2018acted in accordance with perfectly understandable advice.\u2019 Lord Scott  said\n(ibid [80]) that this approach still allowed for the case where the employer \u2018singled out\u2019 a worker  for  less  favourable\ntreatment but allowed \u2018justice  to  be  done  to  an  employer  who...would  otherwise  be  placed...in  an  unacceptable\nMorton\u2019s fork\u2019. And Lord Hoffman observed (ibid [59]) that the Chief Constable\u2019s act may have  been  \u2018a  reasonable\nresponse to the need to protect the employer\u2019s interests as a party to litigation.\u2019\n[87] [2007] ICR 841.\n[88] Ibid, [68].

In its most recent pronouncement on  victimisation,  the  Supreme  Court,  in  Burlington  Northern  v\nWhite 126 S Ct 2405, 2414-2415 (2006), stated that there is liability if \u2018a reasonable employee would have  found  the\nchallenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have  dissuaded  a  reasonable  worker\nfrom making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u2019 In Carmona-Rivera v Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 464 F 3d\n14, 20 (2006), the 1st Circuit took this \u2018reasonable  worker\u2019  to  include  other  workers.

These  provisions  outlaw  discrimination  by  either\nrefusing the service, or not providing it in the like quality, manner, or terms. The Court of Appeal, when allowing  the\nplaintiff\u2019s appeal, criticised the county court judge for confusing  the  simple  question  of  whether  the  plaintiff  was\nrefused a service, with an inquiry into whether she suffered a \u2018detriment\u2019 and thus held that a refusal to  serve  women\nat the bar, offering table service instead, was de minimis.

Employment-related victimisation, harassment  and  discrimination  against  ex-workers  is  covered  by  a  free-\nstanding provision codifying Case C-185\/97 Coote v Granada ECR-I 5199 (see text  to  n  145):  RRA  1976,  s  27A;\nSDA 1975, s 20A; Religion or Belief Regulations 2003, reg 21; Sexual  Orientation  Regulations  2003,  reg  21;  Age\nRegulations 2006, reg 24; DDA 1995, s 16A.\n[176]  Note  that  giving  evidence  in  support  of  a  claim  is  a  protected  act  and  so  attracts  protection  from   the\nvictimisation provisions. See section 2B above.\n[177] [2001] ICR 1065, [80]. See section 3 above.\n[178] 97 F 3d 672, 677-678 (2nd Cir 1996). See text to n 50.\n[179] See n 61 and text to n 145. This may have been done to bolster the House\u2019s reinterpretation of Khan, which was\nthat the decision turned on the absence of a detriment suffered by the claimant. See text to n 140.\n[180] See section 4C above.\n[181] See the Board of Governors case, 957 F 2d 424, 428, n5 (7th Cir 1992), discussed text to n 43.\n[182] A further policy consideration beyond  the  polarised  debate  between  worker  and  employer  comes  from  the\nprospective employer\u2019s standpoint, who could suffer if not told of a worker\u2019s failings. In one  extreme  example  -  the\nAmerican Eagle case - an airline was not told of a pilot\u2019s failings. He was hired and crashed their plane killing  all  15\npassengers. See RS Alders, E Peirce, \u2018Encouraging Employers to Abandon Their \u201cNo Comment\u201d  Policies  Regarding\nJob  References:  A  Reform   Proposal.\u2019   53   Wash   &   Lee   L   Rev   1381   (1996).   This   may   support   a   rule\ncompelling employers to provide references for certain jobs, or more likely precluding the hiring without a  reference,\nwhich would make the harm to the claimant more predictable.\n[183] See text to n 108.\n[184] 927 F 2d 1322 (5th Cir 1991).\n[185] Ibid, 1330.\n[186] 927 F 2d 1322, 1330 (5th Cir 1991).\n[187] The court further observed that Huber\u2019s policy did not adversely affect all Title VII  plaintiffs,  only  those  who\nhad been dismissed, alleged discrimination, and claimed reinstatement. The policy did not affect, for instance, anyone\nalleging discrimination in promotion or pay, or any dismissed worker seeking only damages. Explained in a rehearing\n942 F 2d 930, 933-934 (5th Cir 1991).\n[188] But see Lord Bridge  in  James  v  Eastleigh  BC  [1990]  AC  751  (HL),  764,  who  held  that  as  reference  to\n\u2018pensionable age\u2019 was \u2018convenient shorthand\u2019 for sex discrimination. Similarly, the US Supreme Court has noted  that\nthe \u2018absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a  facially  discriminatory  policy  into  a  neutral  policy  with  a\ndiscriminatory effect.\u2019 International Union, UAW, v. Johnson Controls, 11 S Ct 1196, 1203-04 (Sup Ct 1991).\n[189] Alternatively, this could be (1) reporting wrongdoing of (2) unlawful discrimination; or (1)  giving  evidence  in\nsupport of a colleague (2) in that colleague\u2019s discrimination claim; and so on.\n[190] A phrase used by Cudahy J to describe  the  similar  problem  with  disability  discrimination  law:  McWright  v\nAlexander 982 F 2d 222, 228 (7th Cir 1992).\n[191] Minister of State for Social Security and Disabled People, 253 HC Official Report (6th series)  col  150,  24  Jan\n1995.

Under the ADA 1990, both indirect and direct discrimination are justifiable. See, EEOC\n29 CFR \u00a7 1630.15 (available at www.eeoc.gov), and eg Ethridge v State of Alabama 860 F Supp  808,  817  (MD  Ala\n1993).\n[198] [2001] ICR 805 (CA)\n[199] Pill LJ stated that where an employer made a \u2018properly conducted risk assessment\u2019 and then  acted  upon  it,  the\nquestion is whether that act fell within the \u2018range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker\u2019 (ibid,  [25]-[26]).\nArden LJ stated that \u2018material\u2019 meant that there had to be a \u2018reasonably strong  connection\u2019  between  the  reason  (the\nworker\u2019s disability) and  the  \u2018circumstances  of  the  particular  case\u2019  (presumably  here,  safe  driving).  No  medical\nevidence was necessary to decide this point.  \u2018Substantial\u2019  meant,  she  continued,  that  the  reason  \u2018must  carry  real\nweight and thus be of substance.\u2019 However, employers were not \u2018obliged to search for the Holy  Grail.\u2019  And  echoing\nPill LJ, the employer must act within the band of responses open to the reasonable employer (ibid [37]-[38]).
