The overall purpose is to convey to\n29\nSanjeev Singh and Jon Dron Networking: a study in planning and developing cross-cultural collaboration\nthe student community the benefits of incorporating a Web-based cross-cultural learning\nenvironment into a conventional course. The criteria for successful applications are\npresented and issues relating to training and design, are discussed.\nThe value of extending the classroom beyond national boundaries is only one of the many\nreasons for increased intercultural communication relating to the growing\ninternationalization of education (Brislin and Yoshida, 1994). On graduation students will\noften be required to interact with others from different cultural backgrounds, whether they\nare well prepared to do so or not. In the hope of building strong international working\nrelationships between people and organizations of different cultures, it is important that\nstudents be prepared for the emerging future where cross-cultural communication skills\nwill be of great importance. One way of developing these abilities is to present students\nwith authentic opportunities to work with people who possess specialized skills in a shared\nsubject domain.\nThe sociocultural context in the present model includes different values, learning\nenvironments and cultural\/social perspectives of learners in two or more countries; these\nconcerns are at the root of many problems that arise in international or cross-cultural\nprogrammes (Conner, 1990). An analysis of cultural issues shows that the predominant\ntrend in the area is to ignore the unique cultural contexts of diverse learners. Occasionally,\ninstructional adaptations and modifications are made to enhance cultural appropriateness,\nbut cultural subtleties and deep-rooted value systems are often neglected in this process. It\nis nonetheless essential to take into account both the deep structure (values, learning styles)\nand the surface level (spoken language, forms of interaction) dimensions of a culture.\nEach country manages its own educational system and establishes its own priorities for\ntraining and design. A 'not-invented-here' mentality has made many established institu-\ntions unwilling to use or recognize courses created by other institutions or in other\ncountries. Funding policies and mission clarity and articulation also become more complex\nwhen carried across national borders (Murphy, 1991). Thus the development of a cross-\ncultural course must be sensitive to these issues in order to succeed.\nRationale\nWeb-based training does not merely provide a different medium for traditional classroom\ninteractions, but creates an environment for students to take part in much richer and\nrelevant educational activities. By incorporating a Web-mediated cross-cultural learning\nactivity into the course curriculum, students may be presented with new and greater\nchallenges that extend beyond their traditional, and often passive, learning of theories and\ncontent. With respect to building cultural awareness and tolerance, Web-mediated cross-\ncultural learning activities have the potential of bringing about behavioural and attitudinal\nchanges in people that otherwise would not occur. For example, students may develop a\ndeeper sensitivity for culturally based differences in work habits by interacting with\nstudents of diverse cultures rather than reading about how one should be culturally aware\nof these differences in textbooks. Likewise, pre-service teachers may acquire a better\nunderstanding of culturally based differences in learning styles, knowledge representation\nand cognition if they are given the opportunity to interact with students from diverse\ncultures.\n30\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nPerhaps more important, however, is that providing students with the opportunity to\nparticipate in an authentic cross-cultural exchange releases them from the proverbial\nacademic vacuum in which they typically build knowledge and understanding from\nreadings and in-class discussions (Dron, Mitchell, Siviter and Boyne, 2000). Computer\ncommunication technology has already changed the image of the classroom. These\nnetworks stretch across international borders to form cross-cultural learning environments\nwhere teachers and students of diverse cultures can learn with and from each other. With\nits capability of bringing innovative views to the classroom instantaneously, this\ncollaborative project presents students with new opportunities to develop cultural\nawareness and build shared knowledge.\nSome of the important criteria for implementing our Web-based cross-cultural learning\nproject are that the collaborative project must:\n\u2022 be relevant to the course and integrated into the curriculum goals;\n\u2022 include some aspect of work or learning that could not be accomplished without cross-\ncultural computer mediation. Student interest in, and commitment to, the virtual\nlearning environment may diminish if they perceive that the learning activities could be\ndone just as easily, if not better, outside the international forum. It is crucial that the\ncross-cultural model contains a unique element or dimension that otherwise would not\nbe present;\n\u2022 have a clear and definite time-frame. Students aware of the time-frame within which\nthey are working may be more inclined to adopt proactive writing habits so that the\nvirtual learning environment is not adversely affected by prolonged inactivity;\n\u2022 be as simple and uncluttered as possible. Overly complex activities may lead to\ninformation overload, resulting in frustration, loss of interest and inactivity;\n\u2022 be preceded with greetings and introductions. Students should be given the opportunity\nto 'meet' online before engaging in the structured learning activity;\n\u2022 encourage information-sharing and knowledge-building. One of the greatest potentials\nof a Web-mediated cross-cultural exchange is to overcome the barriers that restrict the\nflow of ideas and the sharing of knowledge;\n\u2022 avoid compromising learning quality. Although it may provide new and innovative\nlearning opportunities, the academic standards and levels of achievement must be\nmaintained.\nOther advantages of this collaborative project are that, like many electronic methods of\nlearning, it introduces new opportunities for collaborative learning, facilitates\nindividualized feedback as well as contact with peers and faculty, promotes reflective and\ncritical thinking due to its asynchronous nature, and permits students to work at a time\nand pace that is convenient to them. Web mediation can bring these benefits to a learning\nenvironment; cross-cultural applications of this approach therefore have the potential to be\nextremely useful and relevant to students' learning. Therefore, it is more than worthwhile\nto review current curriculum goals for viable opportunities for Web-mediated cross-\ncultural learning activities.\n31\nSanjeev Singh and Jon Dron Networking: a study in planning and developing cross-cultural collaboration\nContext\nThe Indian context\nPedagogical value in India is directed towards acquiring knowledge in the form of\ninformation disseminated by the elders in general, and the teacher in particular (Jadhav,\n1999). Mutual (student-to-student) interaction is less usual, typically being confined to\nexchange of notes and issues relating to interaction with the management of the teaching\nprogramme. Students in India place a high value on the amount of effort one puts in\nacquiring knowledge through textbooks. Emphasis on hard work is also reflected in heavy\ndaily teaching schedules fixed by the system. Students are always busy in finishing their\nassignments rather than looking for other resources. There is little relaxation time or\nflexibility in which to consult other resources because of the time constraints.\nWith the increasing academic competition and pressure on the students to perform well,\nthe education system today encourages earning grades. This is what students concentrate\non: whatever is taught is simply absorbed by them, memorized and then reproduced at the\ntime of examination.\nThe university campuses generally do not provide adequate hostels or dormitory facilities.\nStudents are geographically dispersed. This prevents an educational institution from\nsimply establishing its own Internet and Web service department and forces the educational\ninstitution to rely extensively upon ISP. Thus, it is very difficult to implement such\nnetworks in the majority of universities and higher education institutions. These are\nessentially maintained by individuals.\nThe shortage of Internet bandwidth, spurred by increased Net usage, poses a major\nconstraint in India. The current domestic traffic demands a minimum throughput of 4\nGbps, which at present is serviced by an international pipe with a dismal capacity of\naround 420 Mbps. Already deficient by 88 per cent, the bandwidth used by institutions in\nIndia in general is of the order of 64 kbps to 128 kbps. This is one of the major technical\nproblems in popularizing Web-based learning models in India. Power backup is also a\nproblem, so the typical server downtime is greater than in the UK. The online discussion\ngroups are also limited by the time constraints. Although students may want to join these\ndiscussion groups, the institute may be closed and facilities do not exist at home.\nThe UK context\nThe course in Delhi receives around 2,000-2,500 qualified applicants each year for 35\nplaces. It is thus unsurprising that the quality of the students is exceptionally high when\ncompared with the more modest ratios of the University of Brighton. There are also\nsignificant differences in class size, with a modular system in Brighton teaching up to 150\nstudents in lectures and tutorials at undergraduate level as opposed to the small, focused\ncohort of 35 students in India. Although the motivation of UK students is often very high\n(particularly in postgraduate courses) there is a higher proportion of less able and less\nwilling students, as well as greater difficulties providing personal care and attention from\nfaculty staff. Partly as a result of this, as well as through the active efforts of teaching staff\nand a slightly less rigidly hierarchical social ethos, there is a greater tradition of\nspontaneous group working and mutual assistance amongst students in this institution.\nAlthough technical provision is generally significantly better in the UK than in India,\n32\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nstudents must share resources with a far greater diversity and number of colleagues than\ntheir Indian counterparts, who effectively have a dedicated PC for their own use. Internet\nusage is also somewhat restricted due to constraints placed by JANET and the conflicting\nneeds of different groups of users within the university. For example, use of Internet Relay\nChat (IRC) is explicitly banned. However, the vast majority of students of computing not\nonly have a PC of their own but also a connection to the Internet with a private ISP, so it is\nfar simpler for them to make use of the Net- and Web-based resources to allow flexible\nworking. This extra time helps to compensate for the somewhat lower innate abilities of the\nmajority of students.\nThe ethos in Brighton is only slightly more relaxed than that in Delhi with regard to\ntimetabling and teaching methods, and similar constraints exist to those in India. There\nare, for example, few ways that provision is made for the creation and use of the online\nteaching in the allocation of staff resources. Both institutions are still culturally based in a\ntraditional model of lectures, tutorials and workshops. Although this is changing as a\nresult of pressures from within and without the universities, it provides a greater set of\nobstacles than would be the case if online learning were a more integrated part of the\noverall system.\nMethodology\nA prime concern is that students be adequately trained to use the system so that any\nanxieties or apprehensions about using the technology are overcome by the time the cross-\ncultural Web-mediated learning activity begins. This entails building sufficient practice\ntime into the course curriculum.\nA prototype Website has been launched on one of the servers of the University of\nBrighton (EU-India prototype Website, 2000). This resource is built by and for students of\nthe universities of Delhi and Brighton. Its purpose is to provide a shared resource on the\nsubject of networking for students in India and the UK. A Brighton-Delhi discussion\ngroup has also been created and students are strongly encouraged to interact with their\ncollaborative institute and to comment on the resources. It was important to identify\ncommon ground without diminishing the importance of cultural differences. Both\ncultural-general and cultural-specific approaches to designing the virtual space and\nlearning activity were considered.\nVarious articles and tutorials were chosen to cover the common course curriculum of both\nthe universities. These were uploaded and classified to help students structure their\nlearning. Online tests were also mounted for self-assessment. The students were asked to\nshare their knowledge and queries using the mechanism presented on the site.\nStudents were also asked to prepare a database of resources (URLs, notes and suitable\nlinks) based on their mutual interaction. This was enabled using a Web application\n(CoFIND) developed by one of the authors (Dron, Mitchell, Siviter and Boyne, 1999).\nCoFIND is designed to discover what sorts of metadata are valued by its users. Learners\nenter qualities, the things about a resource which are considered valuable, such as 'good for\nbeginners', 'detailed', 'clear' and so on. These qualities are then used to rate resources that\nthe learners also add to the system. As such, it presents a useful opportunity to identify the\naspects of learning resources valued by groups of learners.\n\u2014\nSanjeev Singh and Jon Dron Networking: a study in planning and developing cross-cultural collaboration\nFindings\nPragmatic issues\nSelecting groups of students with similar interests was not too difficult, as the basic\ncurricula across the institutions are quite similar. However, this was far from being the end\nof the problem. Students in India generally follow a direct path from undergraduate to\npostgraduate qualifications as a matter of course, whereas this is relatively rare in the UK.\nIt was decided that the closest match of curricula and size\/type of course was between the\npostgraduate part of the course in India and a conversion masters course (M.Sc. in\nInformation Systems) at the University of Brighton, notably in the area of networking\ntechnologies. Although the curricula for these courses are similar, they are at slightly\ndifferent ends of the soft-hard divide, with Indian students more concerned with the\nengineering side and British students more involved in the world of organizations and\nsystems. This difference in emphasis was felt to be potentially valuable, allowing the\nstrengths of each group of students to counterbalance the weaknesses of the other.\nBoth courses cater for a group of 30-40 postgraduate students. However, as the UK\nmasters' course is a conversion degree, students are usually at a significantly lower\ntechnical level than their Indian counterparts at the start of the course. To make matters\nworse, semesters in India start in July as opposed to October in the UK, exacerbating the\ngulf between knowledge levels. After much investigation of options, we were eventually\nable to identify a subject and time slot suitable for both groups of students near the start of\nthe second semesters in each institution, which would allow us to apply our requirement\nfor a clear time-frame. This left us with the problem of how to introduce students to each\nother and engage them in mutually beneficial interaction prior to sharing experience and\nunderstanding. The first route to achieving this was through the use of the collaborative\nbookmarking system. Using this, students are able to contribute in an anonymous and\nbeneficial way, with the ability to find resources only loosely related to computing ability. It\nis a system where clear benefits can be achieved through the efforts of a larger, more\ndiverse group.\nWe felt that it was important to start the socialization process earlier than any significant\ncollaboration effort. As such, we created a simple discussion mechanism and relied on\nstudents' curiosity to start it moving. Unfortunately, the difference in semester start dates\nresulted in disappointment for early adopters. A re-launch was planned to make sure\nstudents were informed of the resource in each location. However, even then little use was\nmade of this. Students in both institutions tend to organize their time according to the\nneed to achieve good assessment results rather than out of pure curiosity. As there was\nlittle pressure applied by teachers, and as it was not clear to the students what the benefits\nwould be, it was not heavily used. We were also unable to establish the clear and definite\ntime-frame that we had originally identified as a requirement.\nTechnical issues\nThe initial site that was set up to provide a basis for discussion was built using off-the-shelf\ncomponents (such as a Web-based discussion forum) available as part of Microsoft's\nFrontPage. Although the tool contains some assistance for group working, bandwidth\nconstraints meant that it was not feasible to work together effectively on a single live site.\nHowever, it provided a simple means to get a static, set of pages up quickly. Both\n34\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\ninstitutions employ a wide variety of technologies for Web serving, from Apache under\nSolaris to Microsoft's IIS under NT to Lotus Domino. Of these, Domino seemed the\nlogical choice for the discussion forum due to its ability easily to replicate databases,\nalthough bandwidth issues continue to make this a lengthy process. However, costs for\nextra client licences were high and our budgets were low so the current iteration of the\nenvironment makes use of TalkltOver (http:\/\/www.talkitover.com), an environment which\nprovides the benefits of both bulletin boards and mailing lists in a single (albeit slightly\nslow) package, equally accessible to Indian and British students. We are still considering\nopting for the tried and tested technology of Usenet News which, despite its simplicity,\nprovides most of the features needed in a discussion environment and is more usable due to\nits familiarity and built-in support for replication. However, technical limitations on\npropagation of newsgroups at the University of Brighton have made this hard to\nimplement.\nWe had considered the possibility of synchronous discussions, but the time-zone difference\nmeant that it would be difficult to find times that would fit the timetables of each group of\nstudents and we were keen to make it as simple as possible to communicate.\nCoFIND, the collaborative bookmarking system, was already written using Microsoft's\nASP. Initially two separate systems were installed at each location, but an unfortunate\nseries of technical problems in Delhi (where uninterruptible power supplies need to be the\nsize of large freezers and temperature control is a serious issue) led to the loss of all our\naccumulated data. The bandwidth requirements of the application were not particularly\nhigh so it was felt to be unnecessarily difficult to replicate this across both servers. The\nsystem has now been implemented on a single server in the UK. However, it has mainly\nbeen used by Brighton students, which is felt to be the result of the enthusiastic selling of\nthe system by its author.\nWorking together\nAfter quite brief initial meetings in Delhi, most of the time spent on discussing the process\nhas involved exchanges of email between the authors of this paper. We met in the UK for\nfurther discussions later the same year, and again in Delhi the following year. It is highly\nsignificant that most advances have been made as a result of our face-to-face meetings. A\nlot of the reason for this is to do with the fact that such meetings provide a focused period\nwhen all we need to do is to work on the system. However, it is interesting to observe the\namount of time spent on getting to understand each other's motivation and expectations,\nas well as clarifying meanings.\nDiscussion\nThe experience in India\nIn spite of the common view of pedagogy as knowledge acquisition, the main problem\nencountered during the course was technical. It was observed that students were willing to\nuse the mechanism set up in the project but they were restricted by the system. Although\nstudents may want to join the discussion groups that were set up, for example, the institute\nwas often closed and facilities do not exist at home. This certainly had some effect on lack\nof momentum sustained in discussions, requiring significant commitment to stay involved.\nGiven the students' other priorities, this commitment was generally not achieved.\n35\nSanjeev Singh and Jon Dron Networking: a study in planning and developing cross-cultural collaboration\nThe experience in the UK\nIt was noted at the outset that Brighton's support for materials development was oriented\nto traditional forms of teaching and learning. This posed problems for the collaboration.\nAs Moore and Kearsley note, development of distance learning in a piecemeal fashion is\nunsatisfactory from a student and a developer perspective (Moore and Kearsley, 1996).\nThese problems are exacerbated when trying to integrate materials and resources from two\nculturally and geographically isolated institutions, with no shared systems.\nAs with the Indian students, another major problem was in making students' contributions\nto the joint effort worthwhile in terms of process and reward. Our solution was twofold.\nFirstly, we used the time-honoured trick of making participation a requirement to achieve\nmarks. This is not as satisfying as it might be and much work is still needed to make it\ndesirable to make use of the system as a means to achieving other ends, rather than as an\nend in itself. We therefore put a lot of effort into making the resources as useful as possible.\nTutorials unavailable elsewhere (many created by previous years' students as projects) were\nposted and a lot of emphasis was placed on the importance of finding Web-based help and\nposting it to the collaborative bookmark system. This failed to reach the critical mass\nneeded to make it self-sustaining but was used by some students to help them with\nindividual projects and dissertations.\nConclusions\nWe believe that whilst we have developed a workable model for collaboration, we are not\nyet in a position to report significant success in this venture. Although we have been\nplanning and running parts of the system for nearly two years, progress has been slow and\nfitful. Part of the reason for this lies in attempting to add the collaboration to our already\nfull timetables, but we have also encountered a host of problems from the technical (for\nexample, Delhi's mail server was unavailable for several weeks and an experimental\nbookmark database was lost to a rogue machine) to the practical (for example, the fact that\nstudents in Delhi started just as students in Brighton finished) to the cultural (coming to\nterms with different approaches and another ethos).\nIt is significant that most progress has been made when the authors have been able to meet\nin person. Partly this is due to the need to focus on the issues at hand in a limited time-\nframe, but it also highlights the need for constant checking of cultural cues when\ndiscussing a wide range of issues, and the inadequacy of electronic means of\ncommunication to achieve this.\nFor reasons already cited, this attempt to collaborate has not been as successful as we had\nwished. Technical issues will soon be less important as the reliability and speed of\nnetworked connections improves. However, maintaining the momentum of the project has\nproved to be an intractable problem. Our latest solution is to provide students with\nassignments and projects requiring the development of tutorials which will be of use to\nother students in each country. We then collate this growing resource base, resulting in a\nform of collaboration without the students needing to try too hard. Although this is far\nfrom our original intentions of enabling students to work together, it provides a low\nthreshold process whereby the strengths of students in each institution may be shared and\nmay provide the glue to enable more successful collaboration in future. This part of the\n36\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\ncollaborative project has motivated students to build their own Web-based educational\nresources and now these are maintained by the students in India, including the content\ndevelopment, updating and so on (http:llservices.iicac.iri).\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors gratefully acknowledge the support by the European Commission under the 'EU-\nIndia Cross Cultural Innovation Network' project.\nReferences\nBrislin, R. and Yoshida, T.
