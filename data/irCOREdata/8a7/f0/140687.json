The uncertainty generated by these oscillations can result in late deliveries,\norder cancellations and an increased reliance on inventory to buffer these effects.\nDespite the best efforts of organisations to stabilise the dynamics generated, industry\nstill experiences a high degree of uncertainty from this source. The \u201cSupply chain\ncomplexity triangle\u201d describes the interaction of deterministic chaos, parallel\ninteractions and demand amplification. It provides a useful framework for\nunderstanding the generation of uncertainty within supply chains. The implications for\nsupply chain strategy and manufacturing logistics are discussed.\nKey Words: Deterministic chaos, Parallel interactions, Demand amplification, Bullwhip\neffect, Supply chain strategy, Manufacturing logistics.\nINTRODUCTION.\nPLACE FIGURE 1 HERE \u2013 The Supply Chain Complexity Triangle\nToday\u2019s market place is increasingly dynamic and volatile. Globalisation is resulting in\nmany organisations experiencing market pressures that are forcing a fundamental\nrethink of the way business is conducted. Trade-offs between for example labour costs,\ntransportation costs, inventory costs and response time to customer are becoming\nincreasingly complex [Sharma, 1997]. It is no longer seen as possible only to focus on\none\u2019s individual organisation to gain competitive advantage. It is now recognised that\nthe success of the individual organisation is dependent on the performance and\nreliability of its suppliers and also customers.\nChristopher [Christopher, 1992] emphasises this by stating:\n\u201cCompetition in the future will not be between individual organisations but\nbetween competing supply chains\u201d\n3One key issue known to impact on the effectiveness of a supply chain is that of\nuncertainty [Davis, 1993]. Uncertainties in supply and demand are recognised to have a\nmajor impact on the performance of the manufacturing function. Research at Intel\n[Oliver & Houlihan, 1986] investigating the match between actual call off and the actual\nforecast, estimated that supply and demand were in equilibrium for 35 minutes in 10\nyears!\nThe \u201cSupply chain complexity triangle\u201d provides an explanation for this far-from-\nequilibrium behaviour and gives a useful insight into the generation of uncertainty\nwithin supply chains [Wilding, 1997b]. Three interacting yet independent effects would\nseem to cause the dynamic behaviour experienced within supply chains. These are\ndeterministic chaos, parallel interactions and demand amplification. The combination\nof these effects can significantly increase the degree of uncertainty within a supply\nchain system. Figure 1 depicts these three effects and their interactions. The paper will\ndescribe each effect in turn before discussing the implications for supply chain strategy\nand manufacturing logistics.\nDETERMINISTIC CHAOS IN SUPPLY CHAINS\nThe Collins English dictionary describes chaos as meaning \u201ccomplete disorder and\nconfusion\u201d. However, within this paper the term chaos describes deterministic chaos.\nThe definition used in this work is adapted from that proposed by Kaplan and Glass\n[Kaplan & Glass, 1995 p.27] and Abarbanel [Abarbanel, 1996 p.15]:\nChaos is defined as aperiodic, bounded dynamics in a deterministic system with\nsensitivity dependence on initial conditions, and has structure in phase space.\nThe key terms can be defined as follows:\nAperiodic; the same state is never repeated twice.\nBounded; on successive iterations the state stays in a finite range and does not\napproach plus or minus infinity.\nDeterministic; there is a definite rule with no random terms governing the dynamics.\nSensitivity to initial conditions; two points that are initially close will drift apart as\ntime proceeds.\nStructure in Phase Space; Nonlinear systems are described by multidimensional\nvectors. The space in which these vectors lie is called phase space (or state space). The\n4dimension of phase space is an integer [Abarbanel, 1996]. Chaotic systems display\ndiscernible patterns when viewed. Stacey [Stacey, 1993a p.228] emphasises this by\ndefining chaos as;\n\u201corder (a pattern) within disorder (random behaviour)\u201d.\nProfessor Ian Stewart proposes the following simplified definition [Stewart, 1989 p.17]:\n\u201cStochastic behaviour occurring in a deterministic system\u201d.\nStochastic means random or lawless, deterministic systems are governed by exact\nunbreakable laws or rules. So chaos is \u201cRandom (or Lawless) behaviour governed\nentirely by laws!\u201d\nChaos is deterministic, generated by fixed rules that in themselves involve no element\nof chance (hence the term deterministic chaos). In theory, therefore, the system is\npredictable, but in practice the non-linear effects of many causes make the system less\npredictable. The system is also extremely sensitive to the initial conditions, so an\ninfinitesimal change to a system variable\u2019s initial condition may result in a completely\ndifferent response. One implication of chaos theory is that random behaviour may be\nmore predictable than was originally thought. Information collected in the past, and\nsubsequently dismissed as being too complicated, may now be explained in terms of\nsimple rules. The complication is that due to the nature of chaotic systems there are\nfundamental limits to the horizon and accuracy of prediction. Past patterns of system\nbehaviour are never repeated exactly, but may reoccur within certain limits.\n(Appendix 1 outlines a simple experiment to demonstrate some of the characteristics of\na chaotic system using a spreadsheet and discusses the impact of chaotic systems on\ncomputer accuracy.)\nChaos resulting from supply chain decision making processes.\nThe \u201cBeer Game\u201d a management game developed some three decades ago to introduce\nstudents and industrialists to the concepts of economic dynamics and management\ndecision making has shed further light on the dynamic behaviour of supply chains. The\ngame shows how the inter-relating feedback loops within the supply chain give rise to\ncomplex behaviour within what seems to be a very simple business system. The game\nis run with four teams of participants each team is a company within the supply chain\n5i.e. a retailer, wholesaler, distributor and factory. A team of researchers based at MIT\ninvestigating managerial decision making behaviour have found that participants apply\nsimple rules for making ordering decisions when playing the game [Larsen, Morecroft,\n& Mosekilde, 1989]. It has been found by the analysis of many runs of the beer game\nthat participants vary slightly in the application of the rules. For example some\nparticipants take into account all the inventory in the supply line while others ignore it\naltogether or forget it occasionally, participants may have a slow response to inventory\nfluctuations away from their desired level while others may respond fast and try to\nachieve their target more aggressively. It has been subsequently possible to analyse and\nsimulate the decision rules made to find which rules are the most effective. It was\nrecognised that generally simulations were run over a short period of time, say 60\nweeks. This time period is less than the fundamental period of the system and therefore\nwill not reveal the existence of complex modes of behaviour within the system.\nIt has been found that within the simple model outlined above that one in four\nmanagement teams in the supply chain create deterministic chaos in the ordering\npatterns and inventory levels. This produces costs to the system that are considerably\nsub-optimal, exceeding the minimum possible costs by over 500% [Mosekilde, Larsen,\n& Sterman, 1991]. The results also showed that the slightest change in policy could\nresult in a stable output flipping into the chaotic region, i.e. a transcription error when\ninputting an order, the order delayed in the post, a manager forgets something or inputs\nit a day late, all these everyday seemingly inconsequential delays or errors can have a\ndramatic and costly effect on the management of the supply chain.\nThe authors demonstrated that the more complex forms of chaos occur when an\naggressive stock adjustment policy with low desired inventory and the tendency to\nneglect supply line adjustments is applied. When managers are over ambitious with\nsetting low target inventory levels, chaos is more likely to occur and generally costs are\nlikely to rise. This argument is witnessed in practical industrial environments; driving\ninventory down to low levels can result in distress due to stockouts, rapid and erratic\nreordering and poor customer service levels.\nIncreasingly within industry, managerial decision making rules are being formalised by\ncomputer algorithms. A conclusion that can be drawn is that if such algorithms are\ninappropriately designed chaotic behaviour can be generated, thus contributing to the\nuncertainty experienced in the supply chain.\n6Chaos resulting from supply chain control systems.\nResearch undertaken by Wilding [Wilding, 1997b] to gain an insight into the potential\ngeneration of chaos within warehouse supply chains also provides evidence that\nuncertainty can be generated by deterministic chaos. Figure 2 depicts examples of the\ntype supply chain structures used in the investigation. The supply chains investigated\nare characterised by automatic inventory control algorithms and EDI (electronic data\ninterchange) between the echelons. It is accepted that warehouse supply chains are in\nreality more complex, but the model does capture the main components of such a\nsystem.\nPLACE FIGURE 2 HERE \u2013 Examples of supply chain structures used in the investigation\nThe simulation approach used in this research was a development of that created by\nMike Wilson at Logistics Simulation Ltd. This software and approach to the simulation\nwas chosen as it is used commercially as a training and strategic development tool by a\nnumber of blue chip companies including ICI and Black & Decker [Wilson, 1994]. It\nhas been tested widely in industry and is shown to mimic with good accuracy the\ncharacteristics of actual warehouse supply chains. The simulation has been subjected to\nrigorous validation by the author, engineers and scientists within the University of\nWarwick and also external practitioners and academics.\nThe investigations used an automatic re-order algorithm within the warehouse, which\nforecasts demand, calculates the optimum inventory cover level and places an order to\naccount for expected demand for a given period. This is a widely used re-order and\nstock control algorithm used in industry [Waters, 1992] [Silver & Peterson, 1985\npp.105-107].\nThe main emphasis of the investigation is to quantify how the increasing complexity of\nthe supply chain resulting from increasing the number of echelons and\/or channels\nimpacts on the degree of chaos. This is measured by the Lyapunov Exponent value that\nwas then used to calculate the Average Prediction Horizon of the data from each\nwarehouse [Wilding, 1997a].\nThe investigations demonstrated that warehouse supply chains acted as characteristic\nchaotic systems exhibiting sensitivity to initial conditions, \u201cIslands of Stability\u201d (i.e.\nunder certain conditions the supply chain did not generate chaos), characteristic\n7patterns, the reductionist view was invalidated, and finally, the chaos undermined\ncomputer accuracy [Wilding, 1998].\n\u201cChaotic spikes\u201d in demand were also generated by the supply chains investigated\n[Wilding, 1998]. A \u201cChaotic spike\u201d is a rapid change in demand generated internally by\nthe systems chaotic nature and is not caused by any external event. Unexpected\n\u201cchaotic spikes\u201d have also been witnessed in a spreadsheet model produced by Levy\n[Levy, 1994] of a simple supply chain. Levy concludes that, within the chaotic system,\ndramatic change can occur unexpectedly. Small external changes can occur causing\nlarge changes in demand and inventory.\nPARALLEL INTERACTIONS IN SUPPLY CHAINS.\nSerial interactions in supply chains occur between each echelon in the supply chain i.e.\na single customer and a supplier. An example of a serial interaction would be demand\namplification [Forrester, 1961]. The term \u201cParallel interaction\u201d has been defined to\ndescribe interactions that occur between different channels of the same tier in a supply\nnetwork. An example of Parallel interactions occurs when a 1st tier supplier cannot\nsupply a customer, this results in re-scheduling within the customer organisation\nresulting in the customer changing its requirements on other 1st tier suppliers. This\nresults in uncertainty being generated within the supply network. The supplier is\naffected by an occurrence in a parallel supply chain, which at first would seem\nunrelated. Figure 3 shows a simplified diagrammatic representation of these effects.\nPLACE FIGURE 3 HERE \u2013 Serial & Parallel interactions in a supply network.\nParallel Interactions in an Automotive Supply Chain.\n\u201cParallel interactions\u201d within the supply chain were observed by Jones [Jones, 1990\np.291] in an automotive supply chain, however no quantitative analysis of this\nphenomenon was undertaken.\nJones noticed that poor delivery or quality performance from some suppliers in the\nnetwork affects the efficiency of the good (often Just-in-time) suppliers. Jones suggests\nthat the good suppliers face schedule \u201cripple\u201d variations caused by the poor suppliers.\nThe supply chain structure investigated by Jones forms the basis of an investigation\nundertaken by Wilding [Wilding, 1997b].\n8The model developed by Wilding represents a simple supply network of four suppliers\nproducing sub-assemblies that are combined by the customer into a finished product.\nThe structure is based on a detailed model developed by Jones [Jones, 1990]. This\nmodel was developed to investigate logistics performance within an automotive supply\nchain.\nThe investigation demonstrated that \u201cparallel interactions\u201d between suppliers within a\nsupply network do occur. The impact of the interactions on individual suppliers and the\nassembler has been quantified by calculating the percentage of time the company or\nassembler would be stopped due to the interactions. In practice, an actual stoppage may\nnot occur but organisations may be forced to re-schedule thus resulting in fluctuations\nand uncertainties in demand being experienced by suppliers. The \u201cparallel interactions\u201d\nwithin the network can be reduced by buffering with inventory, however even for large\nbuffers, interactions do occur but less frequently.\nThe investigation also demonstrates and quantifies the impact of variability between the\nforecast demand and the actual demand. Increased variability between the forecast and\nactual demand results in both suppliers and the assembler experiencing increased\nstoppages due to interactions.\nThis work also highlights that a JIT supplier within a supply network is susceptible to\ninteractions from \u201crogue\u201d suppliers (i.e. poor quality and delivery performance\nsuppliers) that can dramatically impact on the JIT suppliers\u2019 utilisation. Inventory is\nrequired to buffer the JIT supplier from such interactions, which may in some situations\nremove the benefits of operating \u201cjust in time\u201d. A \u201crogue\u201d supplier within a supply\nnetwork does not only affect the assembler but also other suppliers in the network. This\nfurther emphasises the need for a holistic approach to supply chain management\nrecognising that the supply network must be treated as a system and not a collection of\nindividual companies.\nParallel interactions can also be a significant source of uncertainty within the supply\nchain. Even with large inventory buffers the parallel interactions have some impact on\nthe utilisation of both the assembler and other suppliers in the network. The results\nfrom this investigation demonstrates that upwards of 18% of the time suppliers and the\nassembler can be stopped by parallel interactions or their programmes can be disrupted,\nthus forcing the assembler and\/or supplier to re-schedule production.\n9DEMAND AMPLIFICATION IN SUPPLY CHAINS.\nThe first piece of work undertaken to understand the dynamic behaviour of simple\nlinear supply chains was carried out by Jay Forrester of MIT [Forrester, 1961]. One of\nthe key outputs of Forrester\u2019s work is a practical demonstration of how various types of\nbusiness policy create disturbances which are often blamed on conditions outside the system.\nRandom, meaningless sales fluctuations can be converted by the system into apparently\nannual or seasonal production cycles thus sub-optimising the use of capacity and generating\nswings in inventory. A change in demand is amplified as it passes between organisations in\nthe supply chain.\nThis type of amplification behaviour has been summarised as the \u201cForrester flywheel\nEffect\u201d[Houlihan, 1987]. Figure 4 shows the nature of this relationship.\nPLACE FIGURE 4 HERE \u2013 The Forrester Flywheel Effect (Adapted from Houlihan, 1987)\nForrester\u2019s work has been further developed by Towill [Towill & Naim, 1993; Towill,\n1996]. Towill has investigated ways of reducing demand amplification and has\ndemonstrated the impact of current supply chain strategies such as just-in-time, vendor\nintegration and time-based management on reducing the amplification effect.\nMore recently, Lee et al [Lee, Padmanabhan, & Whang, 1997a; Lee, Padmanabhan, &\nWhang, 1997b] describe the \u201cbullwhip\u201d effect occurring in supply chains. The\nBullwhip effect is the term used by Procter and Gamble to describe the amplification\nand demand distortion that occurs within the supply chain. The authors refer to four\ncauses of the bullwhip effect.\n\uf0b7 Demand Forecast Updating \u2013 amplification due to increasing safety stock and stock\nin the pipeline.\n\uf0b7 Order Batching - customers tend to order goods at certain times during the week, for\nexample Monday morning. Organisations running Materials Requirements Planning\nor Distribution Requirements Planning to generate purchase orders do so at the end\nof the month. These periodic batching of processes result in surges in demand at\ncertain points in time.\n\uf0b7 Price fluctuations - the impact of promotion results in forward buying, this occurs\nparticularly in the grocery industries. For example, supermarkets in the United\n10\nKingdom recently reduced the price of baked beans to 3 pence per tin. This resulted\nin customers buying large quantities of the product, however it is unlikely that the\nprice will result in increased consumption of the product. As a result the customer\u2019s\nconsumption pattern does not reflect the buying pattern. This results in bigger\nvariations in demand patterns.\n\uf0b7 Rationing and shortage gaming - when product demand exceeds supply\norganisations often ration sales to retail customers. This results in end customers\nplacing multiple orders with different retailers hoping this will result in more chance\nof the product being received within a given lead-time. This of course results in\nexcess demands for products and the manufacturing organisation increasing capacity\nto satisfy all the apparent orders.\nTheir investigation is very much analogous to Forrester\u2019s [Forrester, 1961] original\ninvestigation into amplification within the supply chain. However, Lee et al have taken\nthe original concepts and used examples of relevance to today\u2019s market conditions.\nDISCUSSION\nThe \u201cSupply chain complexity triangle\u201d results because each source of uncertainty can\nact as a stimulus for one of the other sources of behaviour to occur. For example,\ndemand amplification may result in a system operating initially in an \u201cisland of\nstability\u201d to be pushed into a chaotic mode of operation. If the system is operating in a\nchaotic mode of operation the occurrence of a \u201cchaotic spike\u201d being generated within\none echelon may result in demand amplification occurring in the echelons down stream.\nIf, due to the demand amplification and chaos, capacity is exceeded in one supply\nchannel the resulting mis-supply may cause parallel interactions which in turn may\nresult in amplification and chaos. The three interacting phenomena therefore result in\ncomplex demand patterns with limited forecast horizons. This uncertainty will result in\nadditional costs being experienced by those in the supply chain.\nA further paradox identified about the \u201cSupply chain complexity triangle\u201d is that\nmethods to reduce the magnitude of one effect may result in an increase in magnitude in\none of the other sources of uncertainty. This was witnessed in an investigation where\nthe supplier lead-time was reduced, this is known to reduce the degree of amplification\ngenerated within a supply chain [Wikner, Towill, & Naim, 1991]. However, the\n11\nreduction of the lead-time resulted in an increase in the degree of chaos and hence a\nreduction of the prediction horizon of the data series. This result also confirms the\nfinding of Gordon and Greenspan [Gordon & Greenspan, 1994] who recognised that,\nfor chaotic environments, increasing the time interval between actions moved the\nsystem towards stability, therefore the increased supplier lead-time resulted in increased\nstability i.e. a reduction in chaos. This therefore results in a trade-off between\namplification and chaos.\nWilding [Wilding, 1997b] demonstrates that parallel interactions can be buffered with\nincreased inventory within the supply chain. However, research undertaken into\ndemand amplification demonstrates that increasing the amount of inventory cover\nresults in increased amplification [Wikner, Towill, & Naim, 1991]. This trade-off also\nneeds to be recognised.\nImplications for supply chain strategy.\nThe conclusion that complex forms of behaviour can be generated within supply chains\nresults in the requirement to refocus the ways supply chains are strategically managed.\nThe conventional view that supply chain success is dependent on stability and\nconsensus is challenged.\nThe complexity experienced in the supply chain can be viewed as a threat and\nsomething that needs to be avoided and\/or reduced, however achieving these objectives\nmay be difficult in practise. An alternative view is presented by authors such as Parker\n[Parker, 1994], Stacey [Stacey, 1993b] and McMaster [McMaster, 1996] who argue that\nthe complexity experienced may force organisations to innovate and learn. If\neverything were stable organisations would not need to develop new structures or\npatterns of behaviour. Over time, this would lead to lack of innovation and subsequent\nloss of competitive advantage.\nBy understanding the trade-offs within the \u201csupply chain complexity triangle\u201d\norganisations could potentially improve the quality of service to customers by ensuring\nimproved availability of goods, and also reduce costs within the system by more\neffective management of inventory and resources. This therefore improves both cost\nadvantage and value advantage for the organisations.\nThe analysis undertaken further emphasises the importance of treating the supply chain\nas a complete system. The whole is not the sum of the parts. Small changes made to\n12\noptimise one echelon of the supply chain can result in massive changes in other parts of\nthe supply chain. This may subsequently result in the sub-optimisation of the total\nsystem performance.\nLong term planning within chaotic systems is also particularly difficult. Small\ndisturbances are multiplied over time and because of the non-linear relationships\npresent, the system is very sensitive to initial conditions. Traditional Materials\nRequirements Planning (MRP) systems used in industry are reliant on long term sales\nforecasts which are usually inaccurate. This can result in excessive stock holding\n[Burbidge, 1983].\nTom McGuffog of the international organisation Nestle recently concluded that the\ncomplex statistical forecasting packages employed by their organisation do not\nsubstantially assist the interpretation of demand [McGuffog, 1997]. He observes that\nfor these systems to be successful there would need to be patterns susceptible to\nstatistical analysis and prognosis. These simple patterns are not observed in practice,\nand traditional forecasting techniques have had very limited success. These\nobservations add further evidence that the complex dynamics generated may be chaotic\nin nature.\nThe benefit of allocating resource to more and more complex models for forecasting\nmay be small. Short-term forecasts and prediction of patterns can be made with\nreasonable accuracy. Chaotic systems trace repetitive patterns that may make it\npossible to forecast levels of stock or demand within certain tolerance bands.\nNon-linear dynamic analysis can also be used to estimate the forecast horizon of supply\nchain systems. This has the benefit of focusing resources on forecasting up to that\nhorizon and not wasting resources on trying to forecast past this horizon into the\nunpredictable future. The use of Lyapunov exponents and the subsequent calculation of\nthe prediction horizon can be used as a technique for quantifying what \u201cshort-term\u201d and\n\u201clong-term\u201d mean within a business environment. Short-term management and\nstrategies can be defined for operation within the prediction horizon. Long-term\npolicies and strategies are defined as those that function outside this forecast horizon.\nThe concept of short-term strategic management may be the most effective strategic\napproach for management within supply chains [Saisse & Wilding, 1997]. Managers\nwithin an organisation need to be aware of the strategic consequences of their daily\nshort-term decisions. These decisions must be aligned with the overall business strategy\n13\nof the organisation, and this raises the requirement for management tools and\ntechniques. This type of approach to management within uncertain environments has\nthe potential to be applied across the complete supply chain [Saisse & Wilding, 1997].\nA further implication of this work applies to the evolving structure of supply chains.\nAnalysis into automotive parts supply chains is forecasting that by the year 2005 the\nstructure of the supply chain will change dramatically with the requirement for an\nincrease in echelons but a reduction in the number of channels [Disney, Childerhouse,\n& Naim, 1997]. The \u201cSupply chain complexity triangle\u201d raises a number of key issues\nabout this supply chain re-engineering process. Increasing the number of echelons will\nresult in an increase in the amount of chaos and amplification experienced, but reducing\nthe number of channels will result in a reduction in the number of parallel interactions.\nThe strategists involved in this work would be wise to understand the implications of\nthis trade-off.\nImplications for manufacturing logistics\nThe purpose of inventory control systems as described by Waters [Waters, 1992 p.16] is\nas follows;\n\u201cInventory control is based on the use of quantitative models which relate\ndemand, cost and other variables to find optimal values for order quantities,\ntiming of orders and so on\u201d\nThe implication of supply chains readily generating deterministic chaos is that a system\nwhich is meant to control and level fluctuations, and consequently buffer the system\nfrom instability, can create dynamics which turn a stable predictable, demand pattern\ninto a demand pattern which is unpredictable with occasional explosive changes in\ndemand, so further destabilising the system. Thus a system designed to optimise stock\nholding and order management can actually increase unpredictability and costs incurred\nacross the total supply chain.\nManufacturing planning systems are often run in a batch mode at particular time\nintervals (for example one every four weeks). This is often a result of the time it takes\nto do all the calculations and processing. One implication of supply chains behaving\nchaotically is that if the time period between runs of the planning system is greater than\nthe prediction horizon, the planning for events outside the prediction horizon could be\n14\ncompletely inaccurate. By running the planning system with a period of less than the\nprediction horizon uncertainty due to chaos will be minimised.\nHowever, rather than learning to live with chaos it may be better to remove it all\ntogether. The key to the removal of chaos is the use of systems that do not have direct\nfeedback loops. The exponentially smoothed forecasting system used in the warehouse\nmodel is one such feedback loop. Simulations using simple re-order point systems do\nnot produce chaotic behaviour as no feedback loops are present, however demand\namplification has been shown to be a major drawback with this type of system. Many\nlean approaches to manufacturing do not rely on complex feedback systems. Focusing\non the uninterrupted flow of material that matches the pull from the customer, which is\nthe basis of such techniques, can be seen to eliminate feedback and consequently the\nconditions required to produce further chaos. However, the misapplication of lean\nmanufacturing, such as wholesale reduction of inventory and lead-times, can result in\nthe system exhibiting increased chaos. Period Batch Control (PBC) is another\ntechnique, which, if used appropriately, can remove chaos. It enables parts to be made\nin balanced product sets that match customer demand. No production of parts should be\nmade for stock intended to cover future requirement [Burbidge, 1983]. Hill [Hill, 1996]\ndiscusses the use of Statistical Process Control (SPC) in monitoring demand from\ncustomers. He proposes a system where production is levelled and strategic stocks are\nused to buffer against uncertainty. SPC is used to quantify the level of risk and calculate\nthe buffer required. This is not altered unless the system is seen to change dramatically.\nThis form of system also relies on pull from customer demand. However inventory is\nused to strategically buffer fluctuations and thus level production. This would also\nresult in stable demand being passed onto suppliers further down the supply chain.\nInventory can be used to buffer the uncertainty but this may increase the costs for those\noperating Just-in-time. Organisations implementing Just-in-time therefore need to\nensure that their systems are flexible and responsive enough to cope with the increase in\nuncertainty that may be experienced. This may account for disappointing\nimprovements experienced by many implementing JIT. If Just-in-time inventory\nsystems are to be employed all the business and manufacturing systems need to be\nreviewed to ensure their flexibility and responsiveness to cope with the possibility of\nincreased uncertainty. This review may result in organisations recognising that\n15\ninventory buffering and the production techniques outlined above and advocated by\nBurbidge and Hill being more appropriate.\nCONCLUSIONS.\nThe \u201cSupply chain complexity triangle\u201d provides a useful structure within which to\nunderstand the generation of uncertainty with a supply chain. The key implications for\nmanagement are as follows:-\n\uf0b7 Dramatic change can occur unexpectedly. Chaotic spikes in demand can occur\ngenerated by the system and not as the result of external events.\n\uf0b7 Long term planning is very difficult. If long-term plans are made they need to be\nreviewed on a regular basis.\n\uf0b7 Supply chains do not reach stable equilibrium, small perturbations will always\nprevent equilibrium being achieved.\n\uf0b7 Short-term forecasts and prediction of patterns can be made. It is better to allocate\nresource to the development of effective short-term decision making processes\nrather than long term.\n\uf0b7 Treat the supply chain as a complete system, small changes made to optimise one\nechelon of the supply chain can result in massive changes in other parts of the\nsupply chain. Driving down inventory and lead-times may not always improve\nperformance it could result in the system slipping into chaos.\n\uf0b7 Remove chaos by focusing on the customer; communicate demand information as\nfar upstream as possible, using simple lean approaches.\n\uf0b7 When changing hardware or software platforms, which are critical to an\norganisation\u2019s operation, undertake detailed validation. Computers are prone to\nchaos.\n\uf0b7 Simulation of systems and non-linear dynamic analysis of key outputs should be a\nmandatory part of any supply chain re-engineering proposal. Search for \u201cIslands of\nstability\u201d. Remember that if the model generates chaos the real system with\nincreased complexity may do so.\n16\nReference List\nAbarbanel, H.D.I.

Even simple\nequations can behave chaotically and these can have a dramatic effect on perceived\ncomputer accuracy. To demonstrate this phenomena a simple example will be\ndescribed.\nThe example demonstrates chaos by iterating a simple equation using a standard\nspreadsheet package. The simple equation to be iterated is as follows:\n12 1 \uf02d\uf03d \uf02dtt KXX\nThis simple equation for certain values of K is chaotic.\nFor example, using a clear spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel, type \u201c0.54321\u201d in cell A1. In\ncell A2 type the equation \u201c= 2*(A1*A1)-1\u201d (In this example K = 2). Therefore our new\nvalue for \uf028 \uf029 154321.02 2 \uf02d\uf03dtX or \u201c\u20130.40985\u201d. Now copy the equation down to the\nsubsequent cells in column A. This will result in the equation in Cell A3 reading\n\u201c=2*(A2*A2)-1\u201d and Cell A4 reading \u201c=2*(A3*A3)-1 etc. If you want to plot the data\nuse the \u201cChart wizard\u201d to generate a line graph of the data. You can now start\nexperimenting, introduce a small error by typing \u201c0.54321000000001\u201d and see how\nover time the results diverge due to chaos. Also change the value of K in the equation.\nWhen K is 1 then a stable periodic orbit occurs, the system is attracted to a cycle of 0, -\n1, 0, -1. The equation is relatively stable up until K = 1.5 producing periodic behaviour\nor quasi-periodic behaviour. At K = 1.5 chaos occurs and the dynamics become\nincreasingly complicated as K increases. However, at K = 1.74 the system behaves\nchaotically but at K = 1.76 stable behaviour occurs. This stable behaviour continues\nuntil K = 1.81 and then chaotic behaviour reoccurs. Therefore an \u201cisland of stability\u201d is\npresent between K = 1.76 to 1.80. At K=2 a more advanced form of chaotic behaviour\ncan be witnessed. Figures 5 and 6 show plots of the data for K = 1.76 (Stable\nbehaviour) and K = 2 (Chaotic behaviour) respectively.\nPLACE FIGURE 5 and 6 HERE\nTable 1 shows the iteration of this equation when K = 2 on two different spreadsheet\nand hardware platforms and two starting conditions differing by a tiny amount. It can\n19\nbe seen that after forty iterations the results start to diverge rapidly. If K is greater than\n2 the equation becomes unstable and the solution approaches infinity. (In doing these\nexperiments you may not get precisely the same numbers as those in the table, this is a\nconsequence of the chaotic nature of the equation.)\nPLACE TABLE 1 HERE\nThis raises a fundamental issue about the impact of chaos on computer systems. An\nidentical program run on two different makes of computer, or different standard\nsoftware packages doing the same calculations can produce significantly different\nresults.\nPeitgen et al [1992] further emphasises this point by stating:\n\u201cMore and more massive computations are being performed now using black\nbox software packages developed by sometimes very well known and\ndistinguished centers. These packages, therefore, seem to be very trustworthy,\nand indeed they are. But this does not exclude the fact that the finest software\nsometimes produces total garbage, and it is an art in itself to understand and\npredict when and why this happens. ...More decisions in the development of\nscience and technology, but also in economy and politics are based on large-\nscale computations and simulations. Unfortunately, we can not take for granted\nthat an honest error propagation analysis has been carried out to evaluate the\nresults.\u201d\n20\nTable 1\nNumber of\nIterations\nIBM 486 using Excel Spread sheet PSION 3a using Psion Spread sheet\nStart Value 0.54321 0.54321000000001 0.54321 0.54321000000001\n5 0.890035 0.890035 0.890035 0.890035\n10 -0.84727 -0.84727 -0.84727 -0.84727\n20 -0.07355 -0.07355 -0.07355 -0.07355\n40 0.625099 0.614856 0.62497 0.614805\n60 0.455086 -0.97999 -0.4463 -0.30702\n80 -0.9822 -0.098716 0.306851 -0.80001\n100 0.05050847 0.0349483 0.322846 -0.58814\nTable 1 \u2013 The Iteration of X Xt t\uf03d \uf02d\uf02d2 112 using Excel and Psion, Using the same start\nconditions and a small error introduced.\n"}
