This involves not only relatively stable institutions \nbut also capacities for governance in the face of turbulence. Thus equipped, I then \noffer some provisional answers to the five issues mentioned above. My contribution \nends with some general remarks on the limits to neo-liberal globalization. \n \nCapital as a Social Relation and an Object of Regulation \n \nIn preliminary methodological remarks, Marx argued that there is neither production \nin general nor general production \u2013 only particular production and the totality of \nproduction. He added that one could still theorize production in general as a 'rational \nabstraction' in order to fix the elements common to all forms of production prior to \nexamining distinct forms and modes of production and their overall articulation in \nparticular economic formations. Thus, rather than develop a transhistorical account \nof production in general or general production (as still occurs in orthodox economics, \nwith its emphasis on the generic features of economizing conduct), attention should \nbe focused on 'a definite production' and how this in turn 'determines a definite \nconsumption, distribution, and exchange as well as definite relations between these \ndifferent moments' (Marx 1973: 85, 99, italics in original). These relations are never \npurely technical or economic but always already social. For, as Marx noted in regard \nto capitalism, capital is not a thing but a social relation (Marx 1974: 717). \n \nMarx located the defining feature of capitalism as a mode of production in the \ngeneralization of the commodity form to labour-power. It was this that enabled the \nself-valorization of capital. For only then did capital's sole source of surplus-value \nacquire a commodity form, economic exploitation through the appropriation of \nsurplus labour acquire its distinctive capitalist mediation through exchange relations, \nand the disposition of labour-power become subject to capitalist laws of value. The \ndominance of the value-form in the organization of labour markets and production \nshapes the nature and stakes of class struggle between capital and labour as well as \nthe forms of inter-capitalist competition around the most effective valorization of \n 3\nlabour-power. Continuing attempts to valorize capital in these conditions are the \nmain source of capitalism's economic dynamism. \n \nMarx identified a fundamental contradiction in the commodity form between \nexchange- and use-value. This was the basis on which he unfolded the complex \nnature of the capitalist mode of production and its dynamic; and showed both the \nnecessity of periodic crises and their role in re-integrating the circuit of capital as a \nbasis for renewed expansion. Building on this argument, I suggest that all economic \nforms of the capital relation embody different but interconnected versions of this \ncontradiction and that these impact differentially on (different fractions of) capital and \non (different strata of) labour at different times and places. They also have \nrepercussions going well beyond the circuits of capital in the wider social formation. \nThese contradictions are necessarily reproduced as capitalism itself is reproduced \nbut they need not retain the same relative weight or significance for accumulation or \nregulation. It is important to add here that 'the reproduction of these contradictions \nwith their contradictory effects and their impact on the historical tendency of capitalist \ndevelopment depends on the class struggle' (Poulantzas 1975, 40-1, italics in \noriginal). For the dynamic of accumulation, including transitions between stages or \nforms of capitalism, is closely related to social struggles.6 These act as the vector \nthrough which contradictions and dilemmas are realized in specific conjunctures.  \n \nGiven these premises, one must ask what precisely is the object of regulation that \nhas so pre-occupied regulation theorists? Obviously, if there is no production in \ngeneral or general production, there can be no regulation in general nor general \nregulation. Instead, following Marx, we can expect 'a definite regulation' oriented to 'a \ndefinite consumption, distribution, and exchange as well as definite relations \nbetween these different moments'. In the case of capitalism, the object of regulation \nis, of course, capital as a social relation. It is important here to consider not only the \n                                            \n6 My substitution of 'social struggles' for Poulantzas's term 'class struggles' is \ndeliberate. What is important is the class-relevance of struggles (whether or not \nconducted by so-called class organizations in pursuit of explicit class interests), i.e., \ntheir impact on capitalist reproduction and regularization. A wide range of struggles \naffect these processes (see below; also Jessop 1997a). \n 4\narticulation of the technical and social division of labour within the circuits of capital \nbut also the articulation between its economic and extra-economic moments. Thus \nthe regulation approach emphasizes not only the labour process and accumulation \nregimes but also the mode of regulation (including the wage relation, forms of \ncompetition, money, the state, and international regimes) and the broader social \nconsequences of the dominance of capital accumulation. In short, the scope of \nreproduction-r\u00e9gulation extends well beyond the capitalist economy in its narrow \nsense (profit-oriented production, market-mediated exchange) to include the direct \nand indirect extra-economic conditions of accumulation as well as the handling of the \nvarious repercussions of commodification and accumulation on the wider society.  \n \nThe next question is: why does capitalism need regulating? The answer suggested \nhere is the indeterminate but antagonistic nature of this social relation and its \ndynamic. This has three key aspects, listed here in increasing order of concreteness \nand complexity:  \n \n(a) the constitutive incompleteness of the capital relation in the real world such \nthat its reproduction depends, in an unstable and contradictory way, on \nchanging extra-economic conditions;  \n(b) the various structural contradictions and strategic dilemmas inherent in the \ncapital relation and their forms of appearance in different accumulation \nregimes, modes of regulation, and conjunctures; and \n(c) conflicts over the regularization and\/or governance of these contradictions \nand dilemmas as they are expressed both in the circuit of capital and the \nwider social formation.  \n  \nFirst, the constitutive incompleteness of capital refers to the inherent incapacity of \ncapitalism as a mode of production to achieve self-closure, i.e., to reproduce itself \nwholly through the value form. This incompleteness is a defining, i.e., naturally \nnecessary, feature of capitalism. For, even at the most abstract level of analysis, let \nalone in actually existing capitalism(s), accumulation depends on maintaining an \nunstable balance between its economic supports in the various expressions of the \nvalue forms and its extra-economic supports beyond the value form. This rules out \nthe eventual commodification of everything and, a fortiori, a pure capitalist economy. \n 5\nIn other words, capitalism does not (and cannot) secure the tendential self-closure \nimplied in the self-expanding logic of commodification. This is rendered impossible \nby the dependence of capital accumulation on fictitious commodities and extra-\neconomic supports. Instead we find uneven waves of commodification, de-\ncommodification, and re-commodification as the struggle to extend the exchange-\nvalue moments of the capital relation encounters real structural limits and\/or \nincreasing resistance and seeks new ways to overcome them (Offe 1984). Moreover, \nas we shall see below, this is also associated with uneven waves of territorialization, \nde-territorialization, and re-territorialization (Brenner 1997; 1998; 1999a; 1999b). \n \nSecond, the various structural contradictions and strategic dilemmas inherent in the \ncapital relation are all expressions of the basic contradiction between exchange- and \nuse-value in the commodity form. There are different forms of this contradiction. The \ncommodity is both an exchange-value and a use-value; productive capital is both \nabstract value in motion (notably in the form of realized profits available for re-\ninvestment) and a concrete stock of time- and place-specific assets in the course of \nbeing valorized; the worker is both an abstract unit of labour-power substitutable by \nother such units (or, indeed, other factors of production) and a concrete individual \nwith specific skills, knowledge, and creativity; the wage is both a cost of production \nand a source of demand; money functions both as an international currency \nexchangeable against other currencies (ideally in stateless space) and as national7 \nmoney circulating within national societies and subject to state control; land functions \nboth as a form of property (based on the private appropriation of nature) deployed in \nterms of expected rents and as a natural resource (modified by past actions) that is \nmore or less renewable and recyclable. Likewise, the state is not only responsible for \nsecuring certain key conditions for the valorization of capital and the social \nreproduction of labour power as a fictitious commodity but also has overall political \nresponsibility for maintaining social cohesion in a socially divided, pluralistic social \nformation. In turn, taxes are both an unproductive deduction from private revenues \n(profits of enterprise, wages, interest, rents) and a means of financing collective \ninvestment and consumption to compensate for so-called 'market failures'.8  \n                                            \n7  Plurinational monetary blocs organized by states could also be included here. \n8  States also fail, of course; as does governance (Jessop 1998). \n 6\n Such structural contradictions and associated strategic dilemmas are permanent \nfeatures of the capital relation but assume different forms and primacies in different \ncontexts. They also frequently find expression in different agents, institutions, and \nsystems as the prime bearers of one or other aspect of a given contradiction or \ndilemma (see below). They can also prove more or less manageable depending on \nthe specific 'spatio-temporal fixes' and the institutionalized class compromises with \nwhich they are from time to time associated. Nonetheless, insofar as these \ncompromises marginalize forces that act as bearers of functions or operations \nessential to long-run accumulation, the emergence of significant imbalances, \ndisproportionalities, or disunity in the circuit of capital will tend to strengthen these \nmarginalized forces and enable them to disrupt the institutionalized compromises \nassociated with a particular accumulation regime, mode of regulation, state form, \nand spatio-temporal fix (cf. Clarke 1977). Such crises typically act as a steering \nmechanism for the always provisional, partial, and unstable re-equilibration of capital \naccumulation (cf. Lindner 1973; Hirsch 1976, 1977). \n \nThird, modes of regulation and governance vary widely. This follows from the \nconstitutive incompleteness of the capital relation and the various forms of \nappearance of capitalism, accumulation regimes, and modes of regulation, the \nrelative weight of different contradictions, etc.. For there are different ways to seek \nthe closure of the circuit of capital and to compensate for its lack of closure. Which of \nthese comes to dominate depends on the specific social and spatio-temporal \nframeworks within which these attempts occur. Indeed, notwithstanding the tendency \nfor capital accumulation to expand until a single world market is achieved, there are \nimportant counter-tendencies and other limits to complete globalization. Hence \nspecific accumulation regimes and modes of regulation are typically constructed \nwithin specific social spaces and spatio-temporal matrices. It is this tendency that \njustifies the analysis of comparative capitalisms and of their embedding in specific \ninstitutional and spatio-temporal complexes; and also justifies exploration of the \npath-dependent linkages between different economic trajectories and broader social \ndevelopments. \n \n 7\nAttention to these issues can provide the basis for typologies for comparative and\/or \nhistorical analysis. The differential competitive advantages of nations, variations in \nnational or regional systems of innovation, contrasting historical patterns of finance-\nindustry relations, and different modes of economic governance, to take just four \nexamples, cannot be fully explained without referring both to the structural coupling \nand co-evolution of economic and extra-economic systems and to the differential \nembedding, disembedding, and re-embedding of economic relations in the lifeworld \nand various extra-economic institutional orders. These same factors also shape the \nforms of internationalization that are pursued from different national economic \nspaces and\/or by multinational firms with their home base in different national \neconomies. Thus Ruigrok and van Tulder have demonstrated that US, European, \nand Japanese firms tend to pursue different internationalization strategies based on \nthe specificities of their home bases \u2013 leading to the non-exclusive dominance of \nglobalization strategies in the USA, of glocalization strategies in Japan, and of multi-\ndomestic internationalization strategies in Continental Europe (Ruigrok and van \nTulder 1995: 174-99). These strategies are associated in turn with different \npreferences in the strategic trade policy pursued by the states that provide the home \nbase for these firms (Ruigrok and van Tulder 1995: 231-38). I return to these \narguments below. Moreover, if different accumulation regimes and\/or modes of \nregulation can be shown to succeed each other, this can also inform chronological \nand\/or causal analyses of capital's periodization (Jessop 2001).  \n \nThis approach also implies that the genesis of specific modes of regulation is \nhistorically contingent rather than capitalistically pre-ordained and that the objects of \nregulation do not, and cannot, pre-date regulation in their full historically constituted \nidentity. Regulation is always historically specific and the forms it assumes in \ndifferent contexts modify the objects subject to regulation. Hence modes of \nregulation and their objects can be seen as structurally coupled and historically co-\nevolving and no a priori primacy should (or could) be accorded to one or other. \nBecause capitalism is underdetermined by the value-form, each mode of regulation \ncompatible with continued reproduction imparts its own distinctive structure and \ndynamic to the circuit of capital \u2013 including distinctive forms of crisis and breakdown. \nThis implies that there is no single and unambiguous 'logic of capital' but, rather, a \n 8\nnumber of such logics with a strong family resemblance.9 Each of these will be \ndetermined through the dynamic interaction of the value-form (as the invariant \nelement) and specific modes of regulation and accumulation strategies (as the \nvariant element) (cf. Jessop 1990a: 310-11). Moreover, since each accumulation \nregime and\/or mode of regulation is the product of the variable articulation between \nthe economic and the extra-economic in specific spatio-temporal conjunctures, these \ndistinctive structures and dynamics are always overdetermined by the embedding of \nthe circuit of capital in broader social relations. This embedding is not simply a \nmatter of interpersonal relations \u00e0 la Granovetter (1985) but extends to institutional \nembedding (Polanyi 1944, 1957) and the coupling of economic and extra-economic \nsystem logics (Messner 1997; Willke 1992, 1996).  \n \nA third implication is that the social struggles that serve as vectors for realising \ncontradictions and dilemmas in specific conjunctures are not reducible to class \nstruggles \u2013 let alone economic class struggles. They include many different social \nforces and many different types of struggle. For, taking account of the economic and \nextra-economic preconditions of capital accumulation and the problems involved in \nextending exchange relations into other systems and the lifeworld, one can identify \nmany different sites and forms of social struggle that affect accumulation. Few are \nbest described in terms of 'class struggle'. I prefer to restrict this term to struggles to \nestablish, maintain, or restore the conditions for self-valorization within the capitalist \neconomy understood in its integral sense.10 Even here the class relevance of \nstruggles is never given once-and-for-always but is both fought for and played out \nover time and space. Other types of struggle relevant to capitalist reproduction \ninclude struggles to resist extending the logic of accumulation (hence \ncommodification or re-commodification) to non- or de-commodified social systems; \nstruggles to prevent the colonization of the 'lifeworld' in defence of identities and \n                                            \n9  Wittgenstein's 'family resemblance' of language games is a weaker notion than \nthat posited here. Whereas there is no underlying logic to all conceivable language \ngames, capitalism does have such a logic (see Bernans 1999). \n10  By analogy with Gramsci's inclusive definition of the state, the integral economy \ncan be defined as 'accumulation regime + mode of regulation' or 'the self-\nvalorization of capital in and through r\u00e9gulation' (cf. Jessop 1997b). \n 9\ninterests that lie outside and\/or cross-cut class interests (e.g., gender, race, nation, \nstage in the life-course, citizenship, human rights, or the environment); and struggles \nover the dominant\/hegemonic principle of societalization \u2013 struggles that extend well \nbeyond class struggles, even broadly understood (cf. Jessop 1997a).  \n \nEcological Dominance, Structural Coupling, and Co-Evolution \n \nMarxist analysis commonly presupposes the primacy of the relations of production \nover the forces of production11 in the mutual development of technologies and the \neconomy. Affirming this does not commit one, however, to the notorious principle of \ndetermination in the last instance of the extra-economic by the economic. Indeed, in \nthe last instance, this is a theoretically incoherent notion. For production relations12 \ncan be regarded as primary only in the economy and not in the wider society. But \none could defend such a principle of determination if it were couched in systems-\ntheoretical terms, i.e., in terms of the economy's 'ecological dominance' vis-\u00e0-vis \nother systems in its environment.  \n \nThe idea of ecological dominance emerged in work on plant and animal ecosystems, \nwhere it refers to the capacity of one species to exert an overriding influence on \nothers in a given ecological community. This is not the place to discuss evolution in \nbiological ecosystems. However, I do want to suggest that the notion of 'ecological \ndominance' can be usefully extended to social systems once allowance is made for \ntheir specificities as communicatively- or discursively-mediated systems and for the \ncapacity of social forces to reflect and learn about their own evolution and engage in \nattempts (successful or not) to guide it. Thus one could study social systems as \nbounded ecological orders formed by the co-presence of operationally autonomous \n                                            \n11 The forces of production include social skills and forms of social organization as \nwell as technical means of production (tools, machines, informatics). \n12  Relations of production must be understood here as 'social relations of economic \nproduction'. It is always possible to extend this notion to equivalent relations in \nother fields of social practice (political, military, legal, etc.) but this deprives the \nnotion of economic determination of any meaning since relations of production \nthen become a feature of all social practices and they lose any specificity. \n 10\nsystems and the lifeworld \u2013 with the structural coupling and co-evolution of these \nsystems and the lifeworld mediated by various competitive, co-operative, and \nexploitative mechanisms. Ecological dominance would then refer to the capacity of a \ngiven system in a self-organising ecology of self-organising systems to imprint its \ndevelopmental logic on other systems' operations through structural coupling, \nstrategic co-ordination, and blind co-evolution to a greater extent than the latter can \nimpose their respective logics on that system. \n \nSuch ecological dominance is always a relative, relational, and contingent feature of \noperationally autonomous systems. Thus a given system can be more or less \necologically dominant, its dominance will vary in relation to other systems and \nspheres of the lifeworld, and it will depend on the overall development of the \necosystem as a whole. It follows that there is no 'last instance' in relations of \necological dominance. Instead it is a contingently necessary rather than a naturally \nnecessary aspect of a given operationally autonomous system. In other words, we \nare dealing with an ecological relation wherein some systems may be dominant, but \nnot where one dominates (Morin 1980: 44). Later I propose that the economy is the \necologically dominant system in contemporary societies (especially in its globalizing \nform) but I first elaborate the general concept. \n \nLuhmann has suggested that the functional sub-system that attains the highest \ndegree of organized complexity and flexibility will tend to dominate the wider societal \nsystem in which it is located. For its dynamic will then have a greater influence on \nthe performance of other sub-systems than they do on it (Luhmann 1974, 1981). \nThis suggestion can be taken further in regulationist terms by identifying five \nanalytically distinct, but empirically interrelated, aspects13 of an operationally \nautonomous system that affect its potential for dominance. These are: (1) the extent \nof its internal structural and operational complexity and associated in-built \nredundancies, i.e., alternative ways of operating and communicating information, and \nthe resulting degrees of freedom this gives it in how a given outcome may be \nachieved; (2) its ability to continue operating, if necessary through spontaneous, \n                                            \n13 Only the first two aspects are explicitly theorized in autopoietic systems theory; the \nothers derive from more general work on complexity and chaos theories. \n 11\nadaptive self-reorganization, in a wide range of circumstances and in the face of \nmore or less serious perturbations; (3) its capacities to distantiate and compress its \noperations in time and space in order to exploit the widest possible range of \nopportunities for expanded self-reproduction; (4) its capacity to resolve or manage its \ninternal contradictions, paradoxes, and dilemmas, to displace them into its \nenvironment, or defer them into the future; and (5) its capacity to get actors in other \nsystems and the lifeworld to identify its own operations as central to the reproduction \nof the wider system of which it is merely a part \u2013 and thus to subordinate their own \noperations to their understanding of its particular reproduction requirements. These \naspects can be decomposed into many, more specific features attributable to \ncomplex, operationally autonomous systems and there have been many suggestions \nregarding the best criteria for identifying and operationalizing them (see, for example, \nAshby 1958; Bendor 1985; Cillier 1998; Grabher 1994; Luhmann 1986; Morin 1980; \nThompson 1994; Willke 1996).  \n \nOverall, where one system has superior capacities in these regards than the other \nsystems in its environment, it will tend to be ecologically dominant. This does not \nexclude reciprocal influences on the ecologically dominant system. Nor does it \nexclude resistances to such dominance or attempts to brake or guide it through \nvarious forms of strategic co-ordination and meta-governance (see below). Indeed, \none of the distinctive features of social systems is their capacity to engage in self-\nreflexive attempts to alter their environments, to guide their (co-)evolution, and even \nto change the forms in which (co-)evolution occurs (cf. Willke 1996: 48-51). \n \nEcological dominance is an emergent relationship between systems rather than a \npre-given property of a single system and, as such, it depends on specific structural \nand conjunctural conditions. First of all, it presupposes the operational autonomy of \nthe ecologically dominant system vis-\u00e0-vis other systems. This in turn presupposes \nclear boundaries between organizations or other social forces and\/or a high degree \nof functional differentiation in macro-social formations. Pre-capitalist economies \ncould not have been ecologically dominant, for example, because they were deeply \n 12\nembedded in wider social relations and lacked an autonomous operational logic.14 \nOnly with the generalization of the commodity form to labour-power does the \ncapitalist economy acquire a sufficient degree of operational autonomy. But even \nwhen capitalism has gained its distinctive self-valorising dynamic, ecological \ndominance is one of its contingent and historically variable features rather than one \nof its generic, naturally necessary properties. For it depends on the specific qualities \nof particular accumulation regimes and modes of regulation, the general nature of \nthe other systems in its environment, and specific conjunctural features.  \n \nWe should note here the considerable historical and conjunctural variability in the \nstructural and operational complexity and equifinality of capitalist economies; in their \ncapacity for self-reorganization; in their power to stretch and compress economic \nrelations in time and space; in their ability to handle contradictions, paradoxes, and \ndilemmas; and their capacities to secure support for the primacy of accumulation \nover other principles of societalization. And we should note, conversely, that other \nsystems vary in their capacity to limit or resist the commodification of social relations \nand to contain the scope of different economic processes within specific territorial \nboundaries. Indeed the ecological dominance of capitalism would seem closely \nrelated to the extent to which its degrees of freedom, opportunities for self-\nreorganization, scope for time-space distantiation and compression, externalization \nof problems, and hegemonic capacities can be freed from confinement within limited \necological spaces policed by another system (such as a political system segmented \nalong Westphalian lines into mutually exclusive sovereign territories). This is where \nglobalization, especially in its neo-liberal form, becomes significant for the relative \necological dominance of the capitalist economic system.  \n \nMoreover, even when the conditions do exist for the capitalist economy to become \necologically dominant in the long-term, crises elsewhere could well lead to other \nsystems acquiring short-term primacy. This is inherent in the fact that no subsystem \nrepresents, or can substitute for, the whole. For, as noted above, each autopoietic \nsystem is both operationally autonomous and substantively interdependent with \n                                            \n14 Cf. Polanyi's contrast between an 'instituted economy' embedded in wider social \nrelations and a 'market economy' structurally coupled to a market society (1957). \n 13\nother systems. It follows that even an ecologically dominant system depends on the \nperformance of other systems and that primacy may even shift to a system that is \nnormally non-dominant in specific conjunctures. This would happen to the extent that \nsolving crises affecting them and\/or solving more general crises that require their \ndistinctive contributions becomes the most pressing problem for the successful \nreproduction of all systems \u2013 including the capitalist economy. For example, during \nmajor international or civil wars or preparations for such events, national states may \nseek to subordinate economic activities to politico-military requirements. This can be \nseen in both World Wars in the twentieth century and in the activities of national \nsecurity states during the Cold War. After such states of emergency (note the term), \nhowever, considerations of accumulation are likely to re-assert themselves. This \ndoes not exclude, of course, path-dependent traces of such exceptional conditions \nwithin the normally dominant system (e.g., the distinctive features of peacetime war \neconomies or the legacies of total war on post-war economic trajectories). But the \necologically dominant system will still have a larger impact on other systems' \ndevelopment in the multilateral process of structural coupling and co-evolution than \nthese other systems do on it.  \n \nIn general terms, one could argue that the economic system is internally complex \nand flexible because of the decentralized, anarchic nature of market forces and the \nrole of the price mechanism both as a stimulus to learning and as a flexible means of \nallocating capital to different economic activities. More specifically, as capitalism \ndevelops, different organizations, institutions, and apparatuses tend to emerge to \nexpress different moments of its contradictions, paradoxes, and dilemmas and these \nthen interact in an unstable equilibrium to compensate for market failures. Capital \nalso develops its capacity to extend its operations in time and space (time-space \ndistantiation) and to compress its operations, making it easier to follow its own logic \nin response to perturbations (time-space compression). Through these and other \nmechanisms it develops the capacity to escape the structural constraints and control \nattempts of other systems. This can occur through its own internal operations in time \n(discounting, insurance, risk management, futures, etc.) or space (capital flight, \nrelocation, extra-territoriality, etc.) or through attempts to subvert these systems \nthrough personal corruption or colonization by the commodity form. This is truer of \nthe exchange-value moment of the capital relation with its capacity to flow through \n 14\ntime and space \u2013 and less true of capital considered in its substantive aspects. For \ncapital in its substantive aspects is itself always already strongly overdetermined by \nits embedding in other social orders and its coupling to other systems (see below). In \naddition to its greater complexity and flexibility, the capitalist economy has a greater \ncapacity for perturbing other subsystems and also makes greater demands on their \nperformance as preconditions of its own reproduction. \n \nGlobalization powerfully reinforces this always-tendential ecological dominance in at \nleast five interrelated respects. Before specifying these, however, it is important to \nnote that globalization is not a single causal process but the complex, emergent \nproduct of many different forces operating on various scales. The first aspect is that \nglobalization is associated with an increasing complexity of the circuits of capital and \nan increasing flexibility in its response to perturbations. Second, globalization \nenhances capital's capacity to defer and displace its internal contradictions, if not to \nresolve them, by increasing the scope of its operations on a global scale, by enabling \nit to deepen spatial and scalar divisions of labour, and by creating more opportunities \nfor moving up, down, and across scales. These enhanced capacities are associated \nwith a marked reinforcement of uneven development as the search continues for \nnew spatio-temporal fixes. This is closely related to time-space distantiation and \ntime-space compression. Third, it reinforces the emancipation of the exchange-value \nmoment of capital from extra-economic and spatio-temporal limitations. This extends \nthe scope for capital's self-valorization dynamic to develop in a one-sided manner at \nthe expense of other systems and the lifeworld. Fourth, it magnifies capital's capacity \nto escape the control of other systems and to follow its own procedures in deciding \nhow to react to perturbations. This is particularly associated with its increased \ncapacity for discounting events, its increased capacity for time-space compression, \nits resort to complex derivative trading to manage risk, and its capacities to jump \nscale. Fifth, it weakens the capacity of national states to confine capital's growth \ndynamic within a framework of national security (as reflected in the 'national security \nstate'), of national welfare (as reflected in social democratic welfare states), or some \nother national matrix. \n \nThe tendential ecological dominance of the capitalist economy does not mean that \nits influence on other systems and the lifeworld is unilateral and uniform. It is, on the \n 15\ncontrary, asymmetrical and variable. The political system, which is currently \nmaterialized above all in the institutional architectures of national states and \ninternational relations and linked to the lifeworld through public opinion, also has \nimportant reciprocal influences on the development of the capitalist economy. Indeed \nit poses the biggest challenge to the latter's ecological dominance. For, whilst the \nstate system is responsible for securing certain key conditions for the valorization of \ncapital and the social reproduction of labour power as a fictitious commodity, it also \nhas overall political responsibility for maintaining social cohesion in a socially \ndivided, pluralistic social formation. The always-problematic relationship between \nthese functions generates risks and uncertainties for capital accumulation as does \nstate failure in either regard. This is why there is typically a strong structural coupling \nand co-evolution between the economic and the political in accumulation regimes \nand their modes of regulation. It is also why struggles over political power are so \ncrucial to the reproduction-r\u00e9gulation of capital accumulation and why the state is so \ncentral to securing the spatio-temporal fixes in and through which relatively stable \naccumulation becomes possible. And it is why globalization, especially in its neo-\nliberal form, represents such a challenge to the actually existing institutional \narchitecture of the political system. For it tends to weaken the typical form of the \nnational state in advanced capitalist societies as this developed during the period of \nAtlantic Fordism and to disrupt the spatio-temporal fixes around which both \naccumulation and the state were organized. These issues are elaborated later.  \n \nOther systems are typically less likely to attain the relative ecological dominance of \nthe political system, let alone that of a globalizing economy, as they depend more on \nthe performances of the political and economic systems than the latter do on them. \nNonetheless, even though the relations between operationally autonomous but \nsubstantively interdependent systems may be more or less strongly asymmetrical, \nthere will always be structural coupling and co-evolution among them. This can be \nexplained through the usual trio of evolutionary mechanisms: variation, selection, \nand retention (Campbell 1969). Variation in activities in each system will prove more \nor less perturbing to the self-organization of other systems. Thus, where \noperationally autonomous but interdependent systems share the same social space, \ntheir development tends to become structurally coupled through mutual adaptation to \nthe changes in their environment generated by the operations of the other systems \u2013 \n 16\nadaptations which are governed by each system's own operational code or \norganizational logic. If a particular pattern of interaction reveals a damaging \nincongruence in mutual expectations, it will either be suspended or expectations will \nbe varied. Those variations will get co-selected that least interfere with the distinctive \nautopoiesis of the different interacting systems and they will then be co-retained as \nthese selections become suitably sedimented in the programmes, organizational \nintelligence, strategic capacities and moral economies of the various co-existing \nsystems. Although attempts are often made to co-ordinate or steer co-evolution in \nsocial systems, no consensus is needed for this sedimentation to occur. Indeed, it \nwould be impossible to guide such a complex process \u2013 any attempts at design are \nalways located within broader processes of blind co-evolution. All that is necessary \nfor such sedimentation to occur is a long-run congruence between individual system \nautopoiesis and inter-systemic interaction.  \n \nThe relevance of these general evolutionary arguments to capitalist development \nbecomes clear as soon as one recalls that the capital relation cannot be reproduced \nexclusively through the value form. For it is asymmetrically interdependent on other \nsystems and the lifeworld for key inputs to help secure closure of the circuit of capital \nand for compensation for market failures. Thus, outside a wholly imaginary 'pure \ncapitalist economy' (on which, see Albritton 1986), capitalism is 'structurally coupled' \nto other systems and to the 'lifeworld'. The former include the legal and political \nsystems, which provide important extra-economic conditions for accumulation even \nin liberal, competitive capitalism; but which are nonetheless operationally \nautonomous from the capitalist market economy and have their own instrumental \nrationalities, logics of appropriateness, and institutional dynamics. They also include \nother self-organizing (or autopoietic) systems with their own mutually distinctive \ncodes, rationalities, logics, and dynamics, such as education, science, medicine, \nsport, art, and religion. All such systems constitute environments for the self-\nvalorization of capital, providing final markets as well as inputs. The 'lifeworld' in turn \ncomprises various social relations, identities, interests, and values that stand outside \nand\/or cut across specific systems rather than being anchored in them.15 It includes \n                                            \n15  I extend the system world well beyond Habermas's couplet of economy and state \nto include any self-organizing system with its own instrumental rationality and \n 17\nsocial relations such as gender, generation, ethnicity, national identity, generation, \nassociational memberships, new social movements, and so forth. These influence \naffect the economy by shaping opportunities for profit as well as influencing struggles \nover commodification, de-commodification, and re-commodification of the wider \nsociety. This can be illustrated through such phenomena as the gendered division of \nlabour; dual labour markets structured around generational and ethnic divisions; the \ndevelopment of markets oriented to the 'pink pound'; concerns about regional, urban, \nand national competitiveness; or the impact of green movements on strategies for \necological modernization.  \n \nThis implies that the development of the capitalist (market) economy is closely bound \nup with non-economic factors and that it never follows a purely economic logic. Its \ndevelopment is always overdetermined by its coupling to other systems and the \nlifeworld. Seen in these terms, the development of the capitalist economy is \nembedded in a wider nexus of social relations and institutions and the lifeworld; its \nevolution is linked to environing, embedding institutions and the activities of wider \nsocial forces; and these institutions and forces may either help or hinder its overall \nreproduction, regularization, and governance. Thus accumulation regimes are \nusually associated with modes of regulation that regularize the extra-economic as \nwell as the economic conditions required for their expanded reproduction and that \nrequire the cooperation of extra-economic forces. This structural coupling develops \nin the first instance through co-adaptation among the economic, political, and other \nsystems. Such blind co-evolution can generate an 'historical bloc', i.e., an historically \nconstituted and socially reproduced correspondence between the so-called \n'economic base' and 'politico-ideological' superstructures of a social formation. \nMoreover, insofar as it is the economy that is ecologically dominant, the historical \nbloc acquires an apparent 'base-superstructure' pattern conforming to economic \ndeterminist predictions. Yet this can be explained in blind co-evolutionary terms \nwithout the need to resort to the notorious principle of economic determination in the \nlast instance understood as a unilinear, unilateral, and uniform causal relationship \n(cf. Jessop 1990a: 358-9).  \n                                                                                                                                        \ninterpret the \u2018lifeworld' more widely to include identity politics, etc., regardless of \nwhether committed or not to undistorted communication. \n 18\n Strategic Co-ordination, Governance, and Meta-Steering \n \nWhereas 'structural coupling' refers to the formal and substantive articulation of \ndifferent structures treated as autonomous structures, 'strategic co-ordination' refers \nto the strategic dimension of co-evolution from the viewpoint of specific social forces. \nThe same systems theory that provides the idea of ecological dominance also offers \nkey insights into the nature and limits of steering as applied to autopoietic systems. It \nexplores how one operationally autonomous system can influence the operations of \nanother such (relatively closed) system by altering the environment in which the \nlatter reproduces itself and also examines how governance mechanisms might \nshape their joint evolution. This is especially relevant to the path-shaping efforts of \neconomic, political, and other social forces to influence, steer, or govern the nature \nand direction of their co-evolution.  \n \nThe evolution of the economy on a world scale is essentially anarchic and its \nrelationship to other systems and the lifeworld is characterized by blind co-evolution \nbased on post hoc structural coupling. Nonetheless, there is limited and localized \nscope for steering economic development and co-ordinating activities across the \neconomic and extra-economic divide. Such activities can occur on different levels: \ninterpersonal, inter-organizational, and inter-systemic. Such path-shaping efforts are \nmediated through subjects who attempt to engage in ex ante self-regulatory strategic \nco-ordination, monitor the effects of that co-ordination on goal attainment, and \nmodify their strategies as appropriate. In this way cooperation among actors from \ndifferent systems will follow from application of their own system's operating codes in \nchanged circumstances rather than from an externally imposed imperative co-\nordination (see Glagow and Willke 1987; Willke 1992; Willke 1996). This can be \nfacilitated by communication oriented to intersystemic 'noise reduction' (promoting \nmutual understanding among different systems), negotiation, negative co-ordination \n(mutual respect for the operational codes of other systems and attempts to avoid \nnegative impacts on these systems), and cooperation in shared projects. It can also \nresort to symbolic media of communication such as money, law, or knowledge to \nmodify the structural and\/or strategic contexts in which different systems function. \nSuch media play a crucial role in mediating the relations between operationally \n 19\nautonomous but substantively interdependent systems. For example, the economy \ndepends on coercion (e.g., to secure property rights) which is not produced within \nthe economy; the polity depends in turn on revenues (in the form of taxes) generated \nin the economy. Money and law provide crucial mediations between these two \norders: money appears as a fictitious commodity in the economy, as taxation and \npublic spending in the political system; law appears as property rights in the \neconomy, as legal rights in the political system. Money and law also serve as \nregulatory devices to bridge relations between economics and politics. Thus money \nconnects the productive and administrative economies and circulates between them; \nand law mediates between civil and political society. In this sense money and law \nstand at the centre of an indissolubly mixed public-private space \u2013 they belong to \nboth the public and private spheres, they must be valid within both the political and \neconomic spheres, and they mediate between them (Th\u00e9ret 1991: 134-145).  \n \nSince the structure of the social world is always more complex than any social force \ncan conceive and its overall evolution lies beyond the control of any social force, \nstrategic co-ordination can only occur in the context of the uncontrolled and anarchic \ncoupling of co-evolving structures and systems. Indeed, autopoietic systems theory \nalso teaches us that such attempts at strategic co-ordination can never fully \nrepresent the operational logic (let alone fully comprehend the current conjuncture \nand future direction) of whole subsystems; and that the development of such \nmechanisms of co-ordination adds further layers of complexity to the social world. It \nthereby risks adding governance failure to market failure and state failure as \nproblems to be confronted, if only through their unforeseen and\/or unintended \nconsequences and side-effects. This raises the issue of whether meta-steering might \nbe possible, i.e., the use of higher-order mechanisms to collibrate different modes of \nsteering (markets, states and other forms of imperative co-ordination, networks).16 \nBut the same arguments that indicate the probability of steering failure apply with \nequal force to meta-steering failure (see Jessop 1998). \n                                            \n16  My earlier work referred to 'meta-steering' as 'meta-governance'. But the latter is \nambiguous because 'governance' refers both to all forms of co-ordinating complex \nreciprocal interdependence and to just one of these forms, i.e., self-organization \nor heterarchy. 'Meta-steering' avoids this ambiguity. \n 20\n \nThese ideas have important implications for accumulation strategies, state projects, \nand hegemonic projects on various scales of action and over different time horizons. \nFor these all represent different attempts to strategically co-ordinate activities across \ndifferent systems and the lifeworld in order to achieve a limited, localized structural \ncoherence in accumulation, state activities, and social formations respectively. \nArmed with these general arguments, I now consider: (a) the structural coupling and \nstrategic co-ordination of capital accumulation and modes of regulation within \nspecific spatio-temporal horizons; and (b) the role of these spatio-temporal fixes in \nfacilitating the displacement and\/or deferral of the contradictions and dilemmas of \ncapital accumulation. \n \nOn Spatio-Temporal Fixes \n \nReproducing and regularizing capitalism involves a 'social fix' that partially \ncompensates for the incompleteness of the pure capital relation and gives it a \nspecific dynamic through the articulation of its economic and extra-economic \nelements. This helps to secure a relatively durable pattern of structural coherence in \nthe handling of the contradictions and dilemmas inherent in the capital relation. One \nnecessary aspect of this social fix is the imposition of a 'spatio-temporal fix' on these \neconomic and extra-economic elements. It achieves this by establishing spatial and \ntemporal boundaries within which the relative structural coherence is secured and by \nexternalizing certain costs of securing this coherence beyond these boundaries. \nEven within these boundaries we typically find that some classes, class fractions, \nsocial categories, or other social forces located within these spatio-temporal \nboundaries are marginalized, excluded, or subject to coercion.  \n \nThe primary scales and temporal horizons around which these fixes are constructed \nand the extent of their coherence vary considerably over time. This is reflected in the \nvariable coincidence of different boundaries, borders, or frontiers of scales of action \n(e.g., medieval polymorphy, Westphalian exclusivity, post-Westphalian complexity), \nthe changing primacy of different scales (e.g., the displacement of the urban scale by \nthe national territorial scale with the emergence of capitalism and the integration of \ncities into national economic systems and their subordination to the political power of \n 21\nstates or the recent emergence of global city networks more oriented to other global \ncities than to national hinterlands) (cf. Braudel 1983; Taylor 1995a,b; Brenner 1998). \nIn this context, then, it is worth enquiring after the implications of globalization for \nspatio-temporal fixes.  \n \nSpatio-temporal fixes have both strategic and structural dimensions. Strategically, \nsince the contradictions and dilemmas are insoluble in the abstract, they can only be \nresolved \u2013 partially and provisionally at best \u2013 through the formulation-realization of \nspecific accumulation strategies in specific spatio-temporal contexts (Jessop 1983). \nThese strategies seek to resolve conflicts between the needs of 'capital in general' \nand particular capitals by constructing an imagined 'general interest' that will \nnecessarily marginalize some capitalist interests. Interests are not only relational but \nalso relative, i.e., one has interests in relation to others and relative to different \nspatial and temporal horizons. The general interest thus delimits the identities and \nrelations relative to which calculation of interests occurs; and it confines the spatial \nand temporal horizons within which this occurs. It involves specific notions about \nwhich identities and interests can be synthesized within a general interest, about the \nintertemporal articulation of different time horizons (short-, medium-, and long-term, \nbusiness cycle, electoral cycle, long wave, etc.), and about the relative importance of \ndifferent spatial and\/or scalar horizons (local, regional, national, supranational, etc.). \nThus a conception of the general interest privileges some identities, interests, and \nspatio-temporal horizons and marginalizes or sanctions others. It also refers to what \nis needed to secure an institutionalized class compromise and to address wider \nproblems of social cohesion. Such success is often secured only through a trial-and-\nerror search that reveals the requirements of 'capital in general' more through \nrepeated failure than sustained success (Clarke 1977; Jessop 1983, 1999b). In \nestablishing this general interest and institutionalized compromise, however, \naccumulation strategies and hegemonic projects typically displace and defer their \nmaterial and social costs beyond the social, spatial, and temporal boundaries of that \ncompromise. This can involve super-exploitation of internal or external spaces \noutside the compromise, super-exploitation of nature or inherited social resources, \ndeferral of problems into an indefinite future, and, of course, the exploitation and\/or \noppression of specific classes or other social categories.  \n \n 22\nDifferent scales of action and different temporal horizons may be used in a given \nspatio-temporal fix to handle different aspects of capital's structural contradictions \nand\/or horns of resulting strategic dilemmas. For example, in Atlantic Fordism, the \nnational state set the macro-economic framework, the local state acted as its relay, \nand intergovernmental cooperation maintained the conditions for national economic \ngrowth. Likewise, in contemporary neo-liberal accumulation regimes, the neo-liberal \nstate's relative neglect of substantive (as opposed to formal) supply-side conditions \nat the international and national levels is partly compensated by more interventionist \npolicies at the regional, urban, and local levels (Gough and Eisenschitz 1996; \nBrenner 1997). In addition, the withdrawal of the state is compensated by capital's \nincreasing resort on all levels to networking and other forms of public-private \npartnership to secure its reproduction requirements. Another illustration of spatial-\nscalar divisions of labour is the tendential dissolution of the distinction between \nforeign and domestic relations. State organization is premised on a distinction \nbetween nation states; and, in this context, some parts of the state apparatus \nspecialize in external relations, some in internal relations. However, with the growing \nimpact of globalization and new forms of competitiveness, inherited divisions of state \nlabour have changed. Not only is the distinction between domestic and foreign policy \nbecoming blurred but we also find sub-national governments engaging in foreign \n(economic) policy through cross-border cooperation, international localization, etc..  \n \nThere can also be a temporal division of labour with different institutions, \napparatuses, or agencies responding to contradictions, dilemmas, and paradoxes \nover different time horizons. For example, whereas finance ministries deal with \nannual budgets, industry ministries would assume responsibility for longer term \nrestructuring. Similarly, corporatist arrangements have often been introduced to \naddress long-term economic and social issues where complex, reciprocal \ninterdependence requires long-term cooperation \u2013 thereby taking the relevant policy \nareas outside the short-term time horizons of electoral cycles and parliamentary in-\nfighting. In both cases there is also scope for meta-steering to re-balance the \nrelations among these institutions, apparatuses, or agencies through a differential \nallocation of resources; allowing them to compete for legitimacy in changing \ncircumstances, etc.. \n \n 23\nGovernance has a key role here in modulating the scalar and spatial divisions of \nlabour and allocating specific tasks to different sites of action. This may be triggered \nby changes in the unstable equilibrium of compromise around which accumulation is \norganized. The neglect of key economic and\/or extra-economic conditions for \naccumulation generates increasing tensions to give them greater priority. These \ntensions may be evident from the emergence of crises and\/or from the mobilization \nof social forces whose support is critical to accumulation but whose interests are \naffected adversely by this neglect (Clarke 1977). Meta-steering enters here as a \nmeans to collibrate different governance mechanisms and modify their relative \nimportance. Collibration is concerned with the overall organization and balancing of \nthe different forms of co-ordination of complex reciprocal interdependence (Dunsire \n1996). In addition to meta-steering practices within the more or less separate fields \nof anarchic market exchange, hierarchical organizations, and heterarchic self-\norganization, there is also extensive scope for meta-governance practices that steer \nthe evolving relationship among these different modes of co-ordination. The need for \nsuch practices is especially acute in the light of the wide dispersion of governance \nmechanisms in an emerging world society and the corresponding need to build \nappropriate macro-organizational and intersystemic capacities to address far-\nreaching increases in the complexity of interdependencies without undermining the \nbasic coherence and integrity of the (national) state.  \n \nThe concept of spatio-temporal fix proposed here differs from David Harvey's notion \nof spatial fix in at least three respects. First, in attempting to redress what he regards \nas the exaggerated concern with time in earlier Marxist dialectical accounts, Harvey \ntends to focus one-sidedly on spatial fixes. But there is a close connection between \nspatiality and temporality in securing the relative structural coherence of capital \naccumulation. This holds not only in the trite sense that space and time are so \ninextricably interwoven that space cannot be seen as static, nor time as spaceless \n(Massey 1992: 77, 80); but also in the sense that these fixes involve the construction \nof specific time-space envelopes (or power geometries) that are based on differential \narticulations of time-space distantiation and time-space compression (Massey 1992; \nSum 1999; Jessop 1999a,b).  \n \nSecond, Harvey examines spatial fixes primarily in terms of just one of the many \n 24\ncontradictions of capital accumulation, namely, that between productive capital as \nabstract value in motion (notably in the form of realized profits available for re-\ninvestment) and as a concrete stock of time- and place-specific assets in the course \nof being valorized. He analyses two aspects of this: (a) the impulsion to accelerate \nturnover time, to speed up the circulation of capital and, hence, to revolutionize the \ntime horizons of economic development \u2013 all of which requires, however, long-term \ninfrastructural investment; and (b) the pressure to eliminate all spatial barriers to \naccumulation, to 'annihilate space through time' \u2013 which requires the production of a \nfixed space. Although Harvey refers to problems of temporality in regard to both \naspects,17 the capitalist solution he identifies is spatial. In particular he focuses on \nthe production of localized geographical landscapes of long-term infrastructural \ninvestments that facilitate the turnover time of industrial capital and the circulation of \ncommercial and financial capital. Later these landscapes (of place relations, \nterritorial organization, and inter-linked places) will need to be destroyed and rebuilt \nto accommodate a new dynamic of accumulation (Harvey: 1996, 6). This analysis is \ncertainly important and insightful. But each of the different contradictions of capital \naccumulation has its own spatio-temporal aspects and associated dilemmas. A \ncoherent spatio-temporal fix must reflect all aspects.  \n \nAnd, third, Harvey does not address the different forms of spatio-temporal fix in \nrelation to different stages or forms of capital accumulation nor their articulation to \ninstitutionalized class compromise or modes of regulation. His is a general model \nthat is illustrated from different stages of capitalism but does not actually distinguish \ndifferent scales or temporal horizons as more or less important in particular periods \nor forms of capitalism. This does not mean that it cannot be adapted to take account \nof these issues \u2013 merely that it remains for this to be done.  \n \nAtlantic Fordism and The KWNS \n                                            \n17 Concerning aspect (a) of this contradiction, Harvey does distinguish the temporal \nhorizons of different fractions of capital (e.g., currency and bond markets, money \nand finance vs productive capitals, land speculators and developers) and note the \nstresses produced by the temporal compression powers of financial capital (1996: \n6). But he nonetheless focuses more on aspect (b) and its distinctive spatial fix. \n 25\n No accumulation strategy can ever be completely coherent or fully institutionalized. \nThis is due both to the opacity and indeterminacy of the conditions necessary to \ncapital accumulation; and to the need to develop and build support for the strategy in \nand across conflictual fields of competing strategies associated with other social \nforces. Nonetheless, insofar as one accumulation strategy becomes dominant or \nhegemonic and is institutionalized within a specific spatio-temporal fix, it will facilitate \nthe consolidation of an accumulation regime within the economic space linked to this \nfix. Because the underlying contradictions and dilemmas still exist, however, any \nsuch regimes are always partial, provisional, and unstable. The circuit of capital can \nstill break at many points. Economic crises then serve to re-impose the always-\nrelative unity of the circuit of capital through various kinds of restructuring. If these \nare compatible with the prevailing accumulation regime, growth will be renewed \nwithin its parameters. If not, a crisis of  \u2013 and not just in \u2013 the accumulation regime \nwill develop, provoking the search for new strategies, new institutionalized \ncompromises, and new spatio-temporal fixes. \n \nIn the so-called 'thirty glorious years' of post-war expansion in advanced capitalist \neconomies, the national scale of economic organization dominated. National \neconomies were the taken-for-granted objects of economic management. This can \nbe seen not only in the circuits of Atlantic Fordism but also in the so-called \nmercantilist regimes or 'trading nations' of East Asia and the import-substitution \naccumulation strategies of many Latin American economies. While international \ninstitutions and regimes were organized to rescue European nation-states and to \nensure national economic growth, for example, their sub-national (regional or local) \nstates acted primarily as the relays of national policy. This 'naturalization' of the \nnational economy and national state was linked (within Atlantic Fordism) to the \nrelative closure of post-war economies undergoing reconstruction on the basis of \nmass production and mass consumption. In several East Asian economies, the \nsame effect was achieved through 'national security' discourses that connected the \nnation's internal and\/or external security to close control over the domestic economy.  \n \nThese claims can be illustrated with some brief comments on accumulation regimes \nand modes of regulation in those economic spaces directly integrated into the \n 26\ncircuits of Atlantic Fordism under US hegemony. These comments concern the \nstructural coherence of this system, the factors leading to its breakdown, and the \nscope the latter offers for a coherent post-Fordism. Such issues cannot be theorized \nwithout starting from contradictions inscribed in capital's various structural forms and \ntheir associated strategic dilemmas. \n \nAtlantic Fordism can be briefly defined as an accumulation regime based on a \nvirtuous autocentric circle of mass production and mass consumption secured \nthrough a distinctive mode of regulation that was institutionally and practically \nmaterialized in the Keynesian welfare national state (hereafter KWNS \u2013 for more \ndetails, see Jessop 1993, 1994, 1999c). My interest here is in the limits of the KWNS \nas a mode of regulation. This made its distinctive contribution to the Atlantic Fordist \nregime by managing, at least for a while, the contradictions in the different forms of \nthe capital relation. The Atlantic Fordist economies benefitted from a spatio-territorial \nmatrix based on the congruence between national economy, national state, national \ncitizenship, and national society; and from institutions relatively well adapted to \ncombining the tasks of securing full employment and economic growth and \nmanaging national electoral cycles. This spatio-temporal fix enabled a specific \nresolution of the contradictions of capital accumulation as they were expressed \nunder Atlantic Fordism. Thus, within relatively closed national economies which had \nbeen institutionally-discursively constituted as the primary objects of economic \nmanagement, national states aimed to achieve full employment by treating wages \nprimarily as a source of (domestic) demand and managed their budgets on the \nassumption that money circulated primarily as national money. The diffusion of mass \nproduction (and its economies of scale) through expanding Fordist firms as well as \nthe development of collective bargaining indexed to productivity and prices were the \nprimary means for controlling wages as a cost of production. And the combination of \nthe Bretton Woods monetary regime and the GATT trade regime helped ensure that \nthe (still limited) circulation of free-floating international currencies did not seriously \ndisturb Keynesian economic management through state control over the national \nmoney. Welfare rights based on national citizenship helped to generalize norms of \nmass consumption and thereby contributed to full employment levels of demand; and \nthey were sustained in turn by an institutionalized compromise involving Fordist \n 27\nunions and Fordist firms. Securing full employment and extending welfare rights \nwere in turn important axes of party political competition.  \n \nSome costs of the Fordist compromise and the KWNS were borne within Fordist \nsocieties themselves by the relative decline of small and medium firms, by workers \nemployed in disadvantaged parts of segmented labour markets, and by women \nsubject to the dual burden of paid and domestic labour. Other costs were borne \nbeyond Fordist societies by economic and political spaces that were integrated into \ninternational regimes (such as those for cheap oil or migrant labour) necessary to \nAtlantic Fordism's continued growth but that were not included within the Fordist \ncompromise. Atlantic Fordism was also enabled through a Janus-faced temporal fix. \nOn the one hand, it depended on the rapid exploitation of non-renewable resources \nlaid down over millennia (notably the 'subterranean forest' of fossil fuels as well as \nraw materials); and, on the other hand, it produced environmental pollution and \nsocial problems that it did not address within its own temporal horizons \u2013 as if \nworking on the principle of apr\u00e8s moi, la d\u00e9luge (see, for example, Altvater 1993, \n247-278; Brennan 1995; Stahel 1999). \n \nCrises in and of Fordism are inevitably overdetermined. The typical manifestation of \nthe crisis in Fordism was an increasing tendency towards stagflation \u2013 which \nreflected the distinctive grounding of its mode of regulation in the wage and money \nforms. But this crisis-tendency was usually overcome through a combination of \ncrisis-induced economic restructuring and incremental institutional changes. The \ncrisis of Fordism was manifested in the breakdown of these crisis-management \nmechanisms. A major contributing factor in this regard was the undermining of the \nnational economy as an object of state management \u2013 notably through the \ninternationalization of trade, investment, and finance and other features ascribed to \nglobalization. This led to a shift in the primary aspects of its two main contradictions \nand gave renewed force to other familiar expressions of the underlying \ncontradictions of capitalism. Thus the wage (both individual and social) came \nincreasingly to be seen as an international cost of production rather than as a source \nof domestic demand; and money has increasingly come to circulate as an \ninternational currency and has thereby weakened Keynesian economic demand \nmanagement on a national level. This shift in the primary aspect of the contradiction \n 28\nin the money form is related to the tendency for the dynamic of industrial capital to \nbe subordinated to the hypermobile logic of financial capital and the tendency for \nreturns on money capital to exceed those on productive capital. At the same time the \nrelative exhaustion of the Atlantic Fordist growth dynamic posed problems of \nproductivity growth and market saturation (which combine to intensify an emerging \nfiscal crisis of the state) and problems of how best to manage the transition to the \nnext long wave of economic expansion (which entails changes in the temporal \nhorizons of state economic intervention and thus in the forms and mechanisms of \nsuch intervention). The crisis of US hegemony is also reflected in struggles over the \nshaping of new international regimes and the extent to which they should serve \nparticular American interests rather than the interests of capitalism more generally.18 \nIn addition, new conflicts and\/or forms of struggle have emerged that cannot be \nstabilized within existing structural forms: two major examples are the rise of new \nsocial movements and the crisis of corporatism. New problems have also emerged, \nsuch as pollution and new categories of risk, which are not easily managed, \nregularized, or governed within the old forms. Finally, we should note that, relative to \nthe growth phase of Atlantic Fordism, some contradictions have increased in \nimportance and\/or acquired new forms. \n \nGlobalization \n \nThis section considers the implications of globalization for the increasing ecological \ndominance of capitalism. The over-inflated, catchall quality of the word 'globalization' \ntends to increase rather than reduce the confusion about current tendencies and \ntrends in capitalism and the wider world. My own view is that globalization is, in \ngeneral, best interpreted as the complex resultant of many different processes rather \nthan as a distinctive causal process in its own right. It is misleading to explain \nspecific events and phenomena in terms of some general process of 'globalization'. If \nadequately re-specified, however, trends towards globalization can certainly help to \nsituate and interpret current changes in the spatial scale of economic (and other \ntypes of) institutions, organizations, and strategies. Indeed, although there are \n                                            \n18 In contrast the new postwar international regimes established under American \nhegemony served broader interests in capital accumulation.  \n 29\ncertainly discernible trends towards globalization, they are inevitably linked closely \nand in complex ways to processes occurring on other spatial scales. Whilst the trend \ntowards global economic integration is promoted through structural trends and \nexplicit strategies on less inclusive spatial scales, the latter are also important sites \nof counter-tendencies and resistance to globalization. \n \nGlobalization has both structural and strategic moments. Structurally, it involves the \nprocesses whereby increasing global interdependence is created among actions, \norganizations, and institutions within (but not necessarily across) different functional \nsubsystems (economy, law, politics, education, science, sport, etc.). These \nprocesses occur on various spatial scales, operate differently in each functional \nsubsystem, involve complex and tangled causal hierarchies rather than a simple, \nunilinear, bottom-up or top-down movement, and often display an eccentric 'nesting' \nof the different scales of social organization. This implies in turn, of course, that \nglobalization is liable to uneven development in spatio-temporal terms. Nonetheless, \nglobalization can be said to increase insofar as the co-variation of relevant activities \nis spatially more extensive and\/or occurs more rapidly. For globalization involves \nboth 'time-space distantiation' and 'time-space compression'. The former process \ninvolves the stretching of social relations over time and space so that relations can \nbe controlled or co-ordinated over longer periods of time (including into the ever \nmore distant future) and over longer distances, greater areas, or more scales of \nactivity. In this regard globalization is a result of increasing spatial distantiation \nreflected in the increasing spatial reach of divisions of labour in different fields of \nactivity and is made possible by new material and social technologies of \ntransportation, communication, command, control, and intelligence. Time-space \ncompression involves the intensification of 'discrete' events in real time and\/or the \nincreased velocity of material and immaterial flows over a given distance. This is \nlinked to changing material and social technologies enabling more precise control \nover ever-shorter periods of action as well as 'the conquest of space by time'. \nCombined with time-space distantiation, differential abilities to compress time and \nspace become major bases of power and resistance in the emerging global order. \nThus the power of hypermobile forms of finance capital depends on their unique \ncapacity to compress their own decision-making time (e.g., through split-second \ncomputerized trading) whilst continuing to extend and consolidate their global reach. \n 30\nIt also poses serious problems for global governance insofar as this must be tackled \nacross a range of potentially contradictory temporal and spatial horizons. This brings \nus to the strategic dimension of globalization. \n \nStrategically, globalization refers to various actors' attempts to promote global co-\nordination of activities in (but not necessarily across) different functional subsystems \nand\/or the lifeworld. This does not require that the actors involved are physically \npresent at all points in the globe, of course; all it requires is that they attempt to co-\nordinate their activities with others in order to produce global effects. The latter can \nrange from meta-steering (constitutional or institutional design) for a more or less \ncomprehensive global order to the pursuit of specific economic-corporate interests \nwithin such a meta-framework. Among the most ambitious global projects one could \ninclude projects for world government, global governance, or a new world order. \nThere is clearly scope for wide variation in such projects as evidenced by the neo-\nliberal, market-led globalization favoured by the World Bank, the horizontal 'global \ngovernance' favoured by proponents (especially NGOs) of international regimes, and \nplans for more top-down inter-statal government. Less ambitious but still global \nprojects might range from attempts to establish 'international regimes' to govern \nparticular fields of action on a global scale through strategic alliances orchestrated \nby transnational enterprises (alliances which may include more local or regionally-\nbased firms as well as non-profit-oriented organizations) or cooperation among \nglobal cities to consolidate their dominance in the hierarchy of global cities down to \nthe efforts of individual firms to consolidate a dominant or even a niche position \nwithin the international division of labour and\/or circulation of goods and services. \nForms of co-ordination involved in globalization can also vary widely \u2013 ranging from \nintersystemic co-ordination in major world forums through inter-organizational \nnegotiation (e.g., strategic alliances) to interpersonal networking (e.g., the Chinese \ndiaspora). Given the importance of the path-dependent contexts of such path-\nshaping activities as well as the inherent limitations of any attempt to steer the \nstructural coupling and co-evolution of operationally autonomous but substantively \ninterdependent systems, there is every likelihood that such projects will be more or \nless unsuccessful in their own terms even if they have significant repercussions on \nvarious scales. \n \n 31\nThus viewed, what is generally labelled nowadays as 'economic globalization' rarely, \nif ever, involves full structural integration and strategic co-ordination across the \nglobe. Processes included under this rubric actually include: (a) internationalization \nof national economic spaces through growing penetration (inward flows) and \nextraversion (outward flows); (b) formation of regional economic blocs embracing \nseveral national economies \u2013 including, most notably, the formation of various \nformally organized blocs in the triadic regions of North America, Europe, and East \nAsia \u2013 and the development of formal links between these blocs \u2013 notably through \nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the New Transatlantic Agenda, and \nthe Asia-Europe Meetings; (c) growth of more 'local internationalization' or 'virtual \nregions' through the development of economic ties between contiguous or non-\ncontiguous local and regional authorities in different national economies \u2013 ties that \noften by-pass the level of the national state but may also be sponsored by the latter; \n(d) extension and deepening of multinationalization as multinational companies and \ntransnational banks move from limited economic activities abroad to more \ncomprehensive and worldwide strategies, sometimes extending to 'global \nlocalization' whereby firms pursue a global strategy based on exploiting and\/or \nadjusting to local differences; (e) widening and deepening of international regimes \ncovering economic and economically relevant issues; and (f) emergence of \nglobalization proper through the introduction and acceptance of global norms and \nstandards, the development of globally integrated markets together with globally \noriented strategies, and 'deracinated' firms with no evident national operational base. \nIn each case these processes could be said to be contributing in however mediated \nand indirect a way to the structural integration and strategic co-ordination of the \ncapitalist economy on a global scale. But they do so in a dispersed, fragmented, and \npartial manner and they are far from producing an homogenized world economy \nmarked by the absence of uneven spatio-temporal development. \n \nThus economic globalization clearly involves a combination of processes on many \ndifferent scales and is certainly far from being a purely 'global' phenomenon. Indeed, \nas Budd (1992) notes, \u2018the global cannot abolish the local'. Instead what \nglobalization involves in both its structural and strategic moments is the creation \nand\/or restructuring of scale as a social relation and as a site of social relations. This \nis evident in the continuing (if often transformed) significance of smaller scales \n 32\n(notably the urban, the cross-border, the national, and macro-regional) as \nsubstantive sites of real economic activities; in economic strategies oriented to the \narticulation of other scales into the global \u2013 such as glocalization, 'glurbanization',19 \ninternational localization, and so forth; and in new social movements based on \nlocalism, various 'tribalisms', or resurgent nationalism and resistant in different ways \nto globalization. This suggests in turn that what can be described from one \nperspective as globalization could equally well be described from other perspectives \nin terms of changing forms of triadization, regionalization, urbanization, and so on. \nNone of these processes is confined to one scale: they are all multi-scalar, multi-\ntemporal, and multi-centric. This implies that a global strategy should be sensitive to \nother scales than the 'purely' global \u2013 especially as the latter has social meaning only \nin relation to lesser scales. Indeed the global more often serves as the ultimate \nhorizon of action rather than the actual site of action, i.e., as an ultimate horizon of \naction, it serves as a means to orient actions on lesser scales! This is not an \ninsignificant role. For failure to take strategic account of the global, even if actions \nremain confined to other scales, could well lead to a more or less rapid loss of \ncompetitiveness. \n \nGlobalization is part of a proliferation of scales as institutionalized, narrated objects \nof action, regularization, and governance. The number of discrete scales of action \nthat can be distinguished is potentially infinite but far fewer scales actually come to \nbe institutionalized as explicit objects of regularization and governance. For this \ndepends on the availability of specific technologies of power \u2013 material, social, and \nspatio-temporal \u2013 that transform potential scales of action into actual sites of action. \nIn addition to logistical means (distantiation, compression, virtual communication), \nthere are modes of governance, organizational technologies, and institutional \narchitectures. In this context I suggest that economically and politically significant \ninstitutionalized scales of action have proliferated due to the development of new \ntechnologies, organizations, and institutions with new spatio-temporal horizons of \n                                            \n19 Whereas 'glocalization' is a strategy pursued by global firms that seek to exploit \nlocal differences to enhance their global operations, 'glurbanization' is pursued by \ncities to enhance their place-based dynamic competitive advantages in order to \ncapture certain types of mobile capital and\/or to fix local capital in place. \n 33\naction. Moreover, as new scales emerge and\/or existing scales gain in institutional \nthickness, new mechanisms to link or co-ordinate them also tend to emerge. This in \nturn often prompts efforts to co-ordinate these new co-ordination mechanisms. Thus, \nas the triad regions begin to acquire institutional form and regional identity, new \nforums have developed to co-ordinating bilateral relations between them. In the \nwake of the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union, and an emerging \nEast Asian economic region, for example, we can witness the emergence of the \nTransatlantic Dialogue, the Asia-Europe Meetings, and Asian-Pacific Economic \nCooperation. Likewise, as regionalism develops within the European Union, we find \nnot only an EU wide committee of the regions but also a proliferation of other peak \nassociations and multi-lateral linkages among regions. Yet lower down the scale, \nlocal authorities develop national associations to represent their interests at national, \nregional, international, and global levels. All of this produces increasing scalar \ncomplexity, increasing scope for deliberate interscalar articulation, and increasing \nproblems in making such interscalar articulation work.  \n \nA similar process is at work regarding temporal horizons of action. New information, \ncommunication, logistical, and organizational technologies have enhanced the \ncapacities of some actors to engage in time-space compression and this has helped \nto transform power relations within and across different systems and the lifeworld. \nTime-space compression contributes to globalization through the increased \ncapacities it offers for time-space distantiation. It also reinforces the ecological \ndominance of the market economy by enhancing the opportunities for some \neconomic agents to intensify the exchange-value moment of the capital relation at \nthe expense of the use-value moment; and for others to respond to this by moving to \njust-in-time production and fast service to their markets (see Sum 1999). Trends \ntowards time-space compression are also accompanied by growing recognition of \nlonger-term temporal horizons up to the longue dur\u00e9e of environmental damage \u2013 \nalthough globalization is also associated with its acceleration. These developments \npose problems of inter-temporal comparisons and calculation as well as inter-\ntemporal co-ordination; and these call for more complex forms of organization and \nco-ordination \u2013 which thereby increase the complexity of the system as a whole.  \n \n 34\nThus, far from producing an homogenized global economic space, processes \ninvolved in globalization actually involve the re-ordering \u2013 across a wide range of \neconomic spaces on different spatial scales \u2013 of differences and complementarities \nas the basis for dynamic competitive advantages. This has both structural aspects \nlinked to the structural coupling and co-evolution of different spaces within an \nemerging global division of labour and its eccentric, nested, sub-scales; and strategic \naspects, with different actors looking for the best means of inserting themselves into \nthe spatial, scalar, and temporal divisions of labour. In this context not all actors are \n(or could hope to be) major global players but an increasing number need to attend \nto the global as a horizon of action, to the implications of changing scalar divisions, \nand to the differential impact of time-space distantiation and compression on their \nidentities, interests, and strategies. The implications of this for economic, political, \nand social action were anticipated by Henri Lefebvre in his argument that 'the \nviability of all strategies of capital accumulation, modes of state regulation and forms \nof socio-political mobilization has come to depend crucially upon the ability to \nproduce, appropriate, organize, restructure and control social space' (Lefebvre 1972, \ncited Brenner 1997: 1). We need only to add that it is not merely the ability to \nproduce, appropriate, organize, restructure and control social space that is at stake \nhere but also the ability to do likewise in relation to the temporalities of social action. \n \nThe Relativization of Scale \n \nThis emphasis on the articulation of scales brings us to a key aspect of the current \nround of globalization \u2013 the relativization of scale. The crisis of Atlantic Fordism with \nits primacy of the national scale has disrupted the mutuality between cities and \nterritorial states characteristic of Atlantic Fordism (Taylor 1995a,b); it has also \ndisturbed the nested relationship between local, regional, and national governments. \nSimilar problems are found in economies outside the former heartlands of Atlantic \nFordism, its semi-peripheries in Southern Europe, or more peripheral regions that \nserved as its production platforms. Thus there is a more general (indeed, global) \nproblem today about the relative importance to be accorded to global, national, and \nso-called 'regional' sites and spaces of economic action.  \n \n 35\nAs economic internationalization and globalization proceeded, the taken-for-\ngrantedness of national economic space has been called into question as national \neconomies became more crisis-prone and unmanageable through traditional forms \nof state intervention in a mixed economy. States could no longer act as if national \neconomies were more or less closed and their growth dynamics were primarily \ndomestic. This has undermined the national economy as an object of economic \nmanagement and led to quite different conceptions of the economy and, a fortiori, its \nmechanisms of economic and social governance. Replacing the national economy \nas the primary object of economic governance is the knowledge-driven economy in \nan era of globalization (Castells 1996). Its growth dynamic depends on how \neffectively a given economic space \u2013 not necessarily a national economy \u2013 is \ninserted into the changing global division of labour. This has prompted concern with \ninternational economic competitiveness and supply-side intervention \u2013 initially to \nsupplement national demand management, later as the primary objective and means \nof economic intervention. Yet no other scale of economic and political organization \n(whether the 'local' or the 'global', the 'urban' or the 'triadic', the 'regional' or the \n'supra-regional') has yet won a similar primacy. Indeed there is intense competition \namong different economic and political spaces to become the new anchorage point \nof accumulation around which the remaining scale levels (however many, however \nidentified) can be organized in order to produce a suitable degree of structured \ncoherence. This involves economic and political projects oriented to different scales \nand has not yet produced consensus on how these are to be reconciled.  \n \nThus we now see a proliferation of discursively constituted and institutionally \nmaterialized and embedded spatial scales (whether terrestrial, territorial, or \ntelematic), that are related in increasingly complex tangled hierarchies rather than \nbeing simply nested one within the other, with different temporalities as well as \nspatialities. There is a marked degree of unstructured complexity as different scales \nof economic organization are consolidated structurally and\/or are approached \nstrategically as so many competing objects of economic management, governance, \nor regulation. There is an increasingly convoluted mix of scale strategies as \neconomic and political forces seek the most favorable conditions for insertion into a \nchanging international order. There is no pre-given set of places, spaces, or scales \nthat are simply being re-ordered. For, in addition to the changing significance of old \n 36\nplaces, spaces, scales, and horizons, new places are emerging, new spaces are \nbeing created, new scales of organization are being developed, and new horizons of \naction are being imagined. The resulting relativization of scale (Collinge 1999) has \ncreated both the perceived necessity for various forms of supra-national economic \nco-ordination and\/or regulation as well as the possibility of regional or local \nresurgence within national economic spaces. The new politics of scale is still \nunresolved \u2013 although I suspect that 'triads' will eventually replace the nation as the \nprimary scale for managing, displacing, and deferring the contradictions and \ndilemmas of a globalizing, knowledge-driven economy.  \n \nThis relativization of scale has major implications for claims about the rise of a 'global \neconomy'. For, whatever the current level of globalization in structural and\/or \nstrategic terms (issues which are still disputed), few would claim that the global \neconomy is now the predominant taken-for-granted economic space. Certainly it \nwould be mistaken to see a single global economy rather than a range of competing \ntendencies and projects to form economic activities into such a system. This can be \nseen in the initial bifurcation of views of 'naturalness' from the 'national' towards the \nglobal and local economies \u2013 evident in the fact that talk of globalization exists \nalongside the rediscovery of the local or regional economy. Subsequent material and \nsocial developments have complicated this position, however, with the emergence of \ncyberspace as a virtual arena of action and the increased importance attached to the \nthree triad regions as sites of economic and political governance.  \n \nIf a new primary scale is to emerge, it is likely to be at the level of the triad. This is \nparticularly evident in the EU (especially as it continues to widen and deepen its role \nin structuring European economic space) and NAFTA (with the overwhelming \ndominance of the USA); but there is also a growing regional division of labour in East \nAsia and China is becoming a more significant player in this regard. Nonetheless, \nrecognising the emergence of 'triad power' should not blind us to three other \nimportant tendencies: (a) the growing interpenetration of the triad powers themselves \nas they seek to develop and to deepen specific complementarities among the triads \nand as multinationals with headquarters in one triad form strategic alliances in \nothers; (b) shifts in the spatial hierarchies within each triad due to uneven \ndevelopment \u2013 reflected not only in shifts among 'national economies' but also in the \n 37\nrise and fall of regions, new forms of 'north-south' divide, and so forth; and (c) the re-\nemergence of regional and local economies within some national economies or, in \nsome cases, cross-cutting national borders \u2013 whether such resurgence is part of the \noverall globalization process and\/or develops in reaction to it. All of these changes \nhave their own material and\/or strategic bases. \n \nAs well as these macro-regional tendencies (triads), there are other sub-global axes \nof regional organization with global implications. These include industrial districts, \ninnovation milieus, learning regions, cross-border regions, and cities. Significant \nchanges are affecting all of them. For example, three major changes affect the \nposition of the urban. First, there is a vast expansion of the size of leading cities \nwithin urban hierarchies so that they become larger metropolitan or regional entities \nwith several centres. Second, as globalization develops further, cities' activities are \nincreasingly structurally integrated and strategically oriented beyond national space. \nThis creates potential conflicts with the national state as some cities become \npotential 'regional states' less oriented to their respective national hinterlands than to \ntheir ties with cities and economic spaces abroad. Third, paradoxically, some leading \ncities have become state-sponsored and state-protected 'national champions' in the \nface of intensifying international competition. This contrasts with earlier periods when \nit was specific firms or sectors that served as national champions. \n \nFor these and other reasons it is important to take account of the 'relativization of \nscale' and its implications for economic, political, and social strategies. This process \ninvolves very different opportunities and threats for economic, political, and social \nforces compared to the period when the national scale could be taken for granted as \nprimary; and it encourages actions both to exploit the processes producing \nglobalization to promote specific values, identities, and interests and\/or to defend \nthem against the frequently disruptive impact of globalization. Thus economic actors \nmay engage in strategic alliances to extend their global reach or seek protection \nfrom global competition behind various protective barriers. Also, as these complex \nand contradictory processes unfold, states on various levels tackle the domestic \nrepercussions of global restructuring by getting involved in identifying and managing \nthe manifold processes that contribute to globalization.  \n \n 38\nThis in turn points to potential for alliance strategies among states on similar or \ndifferent regional scales (e.g., the European Union, whether as an intergovernmental \norganization of nation-states or a 'Europe of the regions') to secure the basis for \neconomic and political survival as the imperatives of structural competitiveness on a \nglobal scale make themselves felt. These alliances will vary with the position of the \neconomies concerned in the global hierarchy. Thus, whilst a small open economy \n(whether capitalist, post-socialist, or socialist) might seek closer integration with the \ndominant economic power in its immediate triadic growth pole, the dominant power \nmight seek not only selectively to bind neighbouring economies into its strategic \neconomic orbit but also to enter alliances with other dominant triad powers. An \nalternative strategy for a small open economy is to seek niche markets in the global \neconomy (perhaps through encouraging strategic alliances with key firms in each \ntriad region) or to form regional alliances with other small economies (whether they \nshare borders or not) as a basis of increasing their economic capacities and \nleverage. Moreover, since the national economy is no longer so taken-for-granted, \nwe also find sub-national regions, cities, and local economic spaces pursuing \nstrategies oriented to the changing forms of globalization and international \ncompetitiveness. Inter alia this is reflected in the formation of strategic alliances \nbetween provinces, sub-federal states, regions, cities, and localities in different \nnational states to promote competitiveness or co-ordinate political strategies \n(Hocking 1999). Such activities are often linked to various forms of 'entrepreneurial' \ncity and region as well as in 'competition' (sometimes also called 'Schumpeterian') \nstates on different levels. An important aspect of each of these different spatial scale \nstrategies is their concern to limit competition within the region (structured \ncoherence) through market-oriented cooperation as the basis of more effective \ncompetition beyond the relevant spatial scale. Yet other economic, social, or political \nforces may call for protectionism on different scales as past regional and local \nmodes of growth are disrupted (ranging from 'Fortress Europe' to 'new localisms', \nfrom the Sao Paulo Forum or the People's Plan for the Twenty-First Century to the \ninformal economic self-organization of shanty towns). \n \n \n \n 39\nThe Illogics of Capitalist Globalization \n \nThe problem of re-regulating capital accumulation after the Fordist crisis is not \nreducible to one of finding new ways of managing the old contradictions within the \nsame spatio-temporal matrix. This is not just because the primary and secondary \naspects of the two principal structural forms in Atlantic Fordism (the wage relation \nand money form) have been reversed. It is also because other contradictions and \ntheir associated dilemmas have become more dominant and the spatio-temporal \ncontexts in which all the above-mentioned contradictions are expressed have \nbecome more complex. I will not spend much time here with the wage relation and \nmoney forms of after-Fordist economies. These have been widely and intensively \ndiscussed and it is not yet proven that after-Fordist forms of wage relation and \nmoney have successfully resolved the crisis-tendencies of Fordism as opposed to \ndeferring and\/or displacing them and, in so doing, creating new forms of international \nand national disorder. This is especially clear in the dominant neo-liberal form of \nafter-Fordist restructuring. For this reinforces the abstract-formal moment of \nexchange value in the structural forms of capital at the expense of the substantive-\nmaterial moment of use value. It is capital in these abstract moments that is most \neasily disembedded from specific places and thereby freed to 'flow' freely through \nspace and time. However, in each of its more concrete moments, as noted above, \ncapital has its own particular productive and reproductive requirements.  \n \nThese requirements can often be materialized only in specific types of spatio-\ntemporal location. This leads to a general tension between neo-liberal demands to \naccelerate the flow of abstract (money) capital through an increasingly disembedded \nspace and the need for the more concrete forms of capital to be 'fixed' in time and \nplace as well as embedded in specific social relations as a condition for their \nvalorization. Indeed, even where the two forms are relatively de-coupled as distinct \nfractions of capital, a concrete 'spatio-temporal fix' is still needed to enable \ndisembedded capital to flow more easily (Harvey 1982). In the case of global finance \ncapital, of course, the grid of global cities (Sassen 1996) provides this 'fix'. Moreover, \nsince abstract capital or 'capital in general' cannot be valorized without the \ncontinuing valorization of at least some particular capitals (as well as, perhaps, \nthrough competition, uneven development, and 'gales of creative destruction', the \n 40\ndevalorization of others), this general tension inevitably creates a whole series of \ncontradictions and dilemmas. \n \nSome of these contradictions were considered in discussing the crisis of Atlantic \nFordism and the KWNS. I now consider three new contradictions and dilemmas that \nhave emerged in the present period of 'after-Fordist' accumulation that are closely \nassociated with the dynamics of globalization. These comprise: first, a dissociation \nbetween abstract flows in space and concrete valorization in place; second, a \ngrowing short-termism in economic calculation vs an increasing dependence of \nvalorization on extra-economic factors that take a long time to produce; and, third, \nthe contradiction between the information economy and the information society. In \naddition, though it is not a structural contradiction, major problems surround the ideal \nspatio-temporal fix, if any, within which the new configuration of contradictions might \nprove manageable. \n \nThe first contradiction expresses the growing separation between the exchange-\nvalue and use-value aspects of the value form that is enabled by the neo-liberal form \nof globalization. The best-known case is the separation of hypermobile financial \ncapital from productive capital \u2013 with the former moving in an abstract space of \nflows, the latter still needing to be valorized in place. For, whereas money capital in \nits various forms is enabled to circulate further and faster around the globe, particular \ncommodities must be produced using particular assets in particular places. The \nintensification of this contradiction is closely linked to the development of information \nand communication technologies, to the emergence of cyberspace, and to the \ncreation of 'offshore' bases for capital's financial operations. But the same \ncontradiction also appears within the individual circuits of financial, industrial, and \ncommercial capital as well as within their interconnections. For, admittedly in \ndifferent ways, each circuit depends on a complex relation between what Kelly \n(1998: 96) describes as a physical marketplace and a conceptual marketspace. \nHowever much economic activity migrates into cyberspace, territorialization remains \nessential to capital. Capital 'remains as dependent as ever upon relatively fixed, \nplace-bound technological-institutional ensembles in which technology, the means of \nproduction, forms of industrial organization and labor-power are productively \ncombined to create and extract surplus-value' (Brenner 1997, 11-12). As well as the \n 41\ngrid of global cities and the role of innovation milieus, industrial districts, etc., even e-\ncommerce needs such a distribution infrastructure \u2013 if only servers and optic fibre \ncables for a 'celestial jukebox' of digitalized music. Thus, an emerging globalizing, \nknowledge-driven, after-Fordism does not signal the final transcendence of spatial \nbarriers but effects 'new and more complex articulations of the dynamics of mobility \nand fixity' (Robins and Gillespie 1992, 149). \n \nThe second contradiction is seen in the paradox noted by Veltz (1996: 12) that '(t)he \nmost advanced economies function more and more in terms of the extra-economic'. \nThe paradox rests on the growing interdependence between the economic and \nextra-economic factors making for structural or systemic competitiveness. This is \nlinked to new technologies based on more complex transnational, national, and \nregional systems of innovation, to the paradigm shift from the Fordist concern with \nproductivity growth rooted in economies of scale to concern with mobilising social as \nwell as economic sources of flexibility and entrepreneurialism, and to the more \ngeneral attempts to penetrate micro-social relations in the interests of valorization. \n \nThis paradox is further intensified by the growing mobility of capital on a global scale. \nRegardless of scale, however, this paradox generates major new contradictions that \naffect the spatial and temporal organization of accumulation. Thus, temporally, there \nis a major contradiction between short-term economic calculation (especially in \nfinancial flows) and the long-term dynamic of 'real competition' rooted in resources \n(skills, trust, collective mastery of techniques, economies of agglomeration and size) \nwhich take years to create, stabilize, and reproduce. It is reflected in the growing \nemphasis given to social capital, trust, and communities of learning as well as the \nenhanced role of competitiveness based on entrepreneurial cities, an enterprise \nculture, and enterprising subjects. Interestingly, the reflexivity that is often said to \ncharacterize post-Fordism enhances this contradiction: it takes time to create \ncollective learning capacities but '(t)hose firms, sectors, regions and nations which \ncan learn faster or better (higher quality or cheaper for a given quality) become \ncompetitive because their knowledge is scarce and cannot be immediately imitated \nby new entrants or transferred, via codified and formal channels, to competitor firms, \nregions or nations' (Storper 1998, 250). And, spatially, there is a fundamental \ncontradiction between the economy considered as a pure space of flows and the \n 42\neconomy as a territorially and\/or socially embedded system of extra-economic as \nwell as economic resources and competencies. The latter moment is reflected in the \nwide range of emerging concepts to describe the knowledge-driven economy \u2013 \nnational, regional, and local systems of innovation, innovative milieus, systemic or \nstructural competitiveness, learning regions, social capital, trust, speed-based \ncompetition, etc.. These different aspects of Veltz's paradox are taken to new levels \nby the growing mobility of capital on a global scale. For this enables mobile capital to \nengage in short-term exploitation of extra-economic resources in one area without \ncontributing to their long-term reproduction and then move elsewhere to engage in \nthe same short-term behaviour. This holds not only for the exploitation of renewable \nand non-renewable natural resources but also for that of socially-reproduced use-\nvalues. An alternative strategy in this regard is seen in the selective migration \ncontrols that enable the costs of reproducing labour-power as a fictitious commodity \nto be borne in some areas and exploited for the benefit of capital in other places. A \nlarge part of the neo-liberal agenda for trade and investment is concerned with \npromoting the juridico-political conditions for such conduct and thereby reinforcing \nthis contradiction by reinforcing the separation between the winners and losers from \nits realization. \n \nA third contradiction that becomes important once again in the after-Fordist (or, at \nleast, the post-industrial) accumulation regime is that between the increasing \nsocialization of the productive forces and the continued dominance of private control \nin the social relations of production in networked knowledge-driven economies. \nAlthough this contradiction exists on many different scales, it is certainly reinforced \nby globalization. For this both widens the arena in which the contradiction can \ndevelop and over which it plays itself out as it matures. On the one hand, the \ngrowing importance of economies of agglomeration and, above all, so-called \n'economies of networks' significantly enhances the socialization of productive forces. \nFor the 'economies of networks' are generated in and through multi-actor, \npolycentric, and multiscalar networks rather than by single (or quasi-vertically \nintegrated) organizations, which are better able to realize economies of scale. In \naddition, there are almost exponentially increasing returns to network size. These \nmean that 'each additional member increases the network's value, which in turn \nattracts more members, initiating a spiral of benefits' (Kelly 1998: 25). These two \n 43\nfeatures highlight the importance of the socialization of productive forces because \nthey make it 'difficult legally to distinguish between different firms' intellectual \nproperty, since all intellectual property is a mixture of innovations arising from \ndifferent places' (Kundnani 1998-9, 56). This in turn reinforces the tendency for \nnetwork economies to be captured by the network as a whole \u2013 albeit often \nasymmetrically \u2013 rather than by a particular firm (Kelly 1998, 26-28). This suggests in \nturn the opportunity for new forms of enterprise to appropriate such network \neconomies for private profit without destroying any broader network(s) involved in \ngenerating them. 'Virtual' firms and networked firms are said to correspond to this \nneed (e.g., Castells 1996, 151-200) \u2013 although recent mega-mergers such as that \nbetween AOL and Time-Warner suggest that other, older solutions may still be \nviable. On the other hand, however, unless the 'virtual' firm becomes co-extensive \nwith the collective labourer, the contradiction is still reproduced on the side of the \nsocial relations of production. For it is in the interests of every capital to have free \naccess to the information, knowledge, expertise, and network economies that it \nneeds to produce its own exchange-values and to be able to charge for the \ninformation, knowledge, expertise, and access to networks that it can produce for \nexchange. A particularly interesting current manifestation of this contradiction is the \nconflicts occurring around intellectual property rights regimes. \n \nA fourth site of problems in the globalizing economy is linked to the relativization of \nscale. It concerns the spatio-temporal fix(es), if any, in and through which the old \nprincipal contradictions of Atlantic Fordism and newly important contradictions of the \ncurrent period might prove manageable. This is closely linked to a new complexity of \ntime-space due to the interaction of new forms of 'time-space distantiation' and 'time-\nspace compression'. Facilitated by new information and communication technologies \nand enthusiastically embraced by some fractions of capital (and some states), this \nhelped erode the spatio-temporal fix of Atlantic Fordism. The further intensification of \nboth processes makes it more difficult to find new scale(s) on which to restabilize \naccumulation and establish effective regulation and governance mechanisms. \n \nThe importance of these contradictions and the relativization of scale in the 'after-\nFordism' period suggest that a stable post-Fordist regime has not yet emerged either \nin the space of Atlantic Fordism or on a wider scale that would correspond to the \n 44\nemerging global capitalist economy. If pressed to identify the principal contradictions \naround which a new accumulation regime would crystallize I would suggest that they \ncomprise the forms of competition (notably the growing importance of the extra-\neconomic conditions of competitiveness and hence their colonization by the value \nform and, tied to this as well as the new knowledge-driven technological paradigm, \nthe emergence of the networked firm as the dominant organizational paradigm) and \nthe forms of the state (notably its restructuring in the light of the relativization of scale \nand of the incapacity of traditional state forms to govern the new economy). I have \naddressed both sets of issues in my recent work on the shift from the KWNS typical \nof Atlantic Fordism to an emerging Schumpeterian workfare post-national regime \n(SWPR) that could help re-regularize an after-Fordist accumulation regime (see \nJessop 1993, 1994, 1999b, 1999c). \n \nGlobalization, Politics, and the State \n \nMy main substantive argument so far is that the tendential ecological dominance of \nthe capitalist economy has been reinforced by the recent waves of globalization as \nwell as by other changes in its structure and operations. This occurs because \nglobalization enhances those generic features of the capitalist economy favourable \nto its exercise of greater influence on other systems and the lifeworld than they can \nhave on it. This is associated with the emergence (or increased significance) of \ncontradictions and dilemmas within the capitalist economy that encourage further \ncolonization of other systems and the lifeworld in order to secure the conditions for \ncontinued valorization. But my argument would remain seriously incomplete if I did \nnot directly address the other major system in the emerging world society with some \nclaim to ecological dominance \u2013 the political system. This should not be confused \nwith the state \u2013 let alone with the national state or even the sum of national states. \nInstead the political system, considered as an operationally autonomous system, \ncomprises all those activities, organizations, and institutions organized around (or at \nleast involved in) making collectively binding decisions for an imagined political \ncommunity. In short, states do not exhaust the political system: they constitute just \none, albeit important, part of the latter. Moreover, once we focus on the political \nsystem, we can see that the state, like capital, is a social relation (Poulantzas 1978: \n128-9). This excludes any treatment of the state either as a simple instrument or as a \n 45\nsubject. Instead it requires us to consider state power (not the state apparatus) as a \nform-determined condensation of the balance of forces in struggle over the making \nof collectively binding decisions in the name of an imagined political community.20 At \nthe most abstract level of analysis of capital accumulation, this form determination is \nmediated through the institutional separation of the economic and political systems \n(and their common separation from the lifeworld) together with the separation of the \nstate apparatus from the rest of the political system. Whereas the former separation \nis essential to the self-valorization of capital despite its dependence on fictitious \ncommodities that cannot be reproduced exclusively in and through the value form, \nthe latter separation is essential to the autopoiesis of the political system in providing \na reference point for political struggles in the face of the infinity of possible political \ngoals and political communities. \n \nIn this sense, the demarcation between state and political system should be seen as \na line drawn internally within the network of institutional mechanisms through which \npolitical power is exercised. Indeed, as Mitchell argues, \u2018[t]he state should be \naddressed as an effect of detailed processes of spatial organization, temporal \narrangement, functional specification, and supervision and surveillance, which create \nthe appearance of a world fundamentally divided into state and society. The essence \nof modern politics is not policies formed on one side of this division being applied to \nor shaped by the other, but the producing and reproducing of this line of difference' \n(Mitchell 1991: 95). Exploring the theme of the state as a social relation involves two \ninterrelated aspects of the state system. We need first to examine the state form as a \ncomplex institutional ensemble with a specific pattern of 'strategic selectivity' which \nreflects and modifies the balance of forces in political struggle; and, second, to \nconsider the constitution of these forces and their strategies themselves, including \ntheir capacity to reflect on and respond to the strategic selectivities inscribed within \nthe state apparatus as a whole (on strategic selectivity, see Jessop 1990a, 1990b). It \nis this latter capacity which is so crucial to a proper understanding of the \n                                            \n20  The equivalent view of capital as a social relation would treat capital accumulation \n(not capital as a factor of production) as a form-determined condensation of the \nbalance of forces in struggle over the production and appropriation of surplus-value. \n 46\nreorganization of the state apparatus and state power as actors in the political \nsystem respond to globalization.  \n  \nThus, to explore the relations between the economic and political systems in an era \nof globalization, it is important to distinguish between the state apparatus and the \npolitical system. For this is a materially- and discursively-constituted distinction that \nmakes a difference in politics. It is also important to accept the idea implicit in \nsystems theory that the political system is self-substituting, i.e., that a crisis in the \npolitical system does not lead to its demise but to its reorganization. Clearly a \nfundamental part of such reorganization would include the redefinition of the \nrestructuring of the 'line of difference' (or demarcation) between the state and the \npolitical system as well as the forms of institutional separation between the economic \nand political systems and their relationship to the lifeworld. This is the approach \nadopted below and I begin with further reflections on the state.  \n \nThe national state is a relatively recent institutional expression of the territorialization \nof political power. It is the historical product of a specific, socially constructed \nterritorial demarcation of the political system and divides the latter into a series of \nterritorially exclusive, mutually recognizing, mutually validating, sovereign states. \nThese in turn provide the reference point for political struggles and, indeed, the \ndistinction between domestic and international politics. Other modes of territorializing \npolitical power have existed, new expressions are emerging, yet others can be \nimagined. Thus it is crucial to study the potential for the re-structuring of statehood \nthrough the de- and re-territorialization of political power. It follows that it is highly \nmisleading to conceive the relationship between a singular emergent globalizing \nflow-based economy and a plurality of traditional national territorial states in zero-\nsum terms. For this would involve treating the current, partly globalization-induced \ncrisis of the territorial national state \u2013 whether in its post-war Atlantic Fordist form, \ndevelopmental statist, national security state, or other forms \u2013 as signifying the \npresent and future impossibility of any other institutional form(s) for the \nterritorialization of political power. Instead the approach developed here suggests \nthat attempts will be made to reconstitute the national territorial state in response to \nglobalization and\/or to establish new territorial scales as the primary nodal point of \nthe institutionalization of political power. This expectation is reinforced if we note that \n 47\nthe westphalian state was never as rigid or as complete as 'the fetishization of space \nin the service of the [national] state' (Lefebrve 1978; cf. 1991: 280-2) might suggest. \nMoreover, once we accept that the delimitation of the state as an institutional \nensemble is both internal to the political system and contingent, we can also assess \nwhether non-territorialized forms of government-governance might acquire increased \nsignificance in the exercise of political power. These points are reinforced when we \nrecall the constitutive incompleteness of the capitalist economy and its dependence \non extra-economic factors. For this suggests that economic globalization will require \nsignificant shifts in the institutional forms, principal activities, and primary scales in \nand through which its extra-economic supports are secured. \n \nTo consider the scope for de- and re-territorialization of forms of state power and\/or \nfor the substitution of non-territorial forms of political power, we must reconsider the \nalleged challenge to national states posed by globalization. The scope for increased \necological dominance of the globalizing economy depends on the capacities of \nleading economic forces to distantiate and\/or compress time-space in ways that \nescape the control capacities of most state-based and state-oriented political forces. \nFor there are few, if any, individual states with an effective global reach and an ability \nto compress their routines to match the time-space of fast hypermobile capital. This \ncreates a growing disjunction between the latter's spatio-temporal horizons and \nroutines and those of most contemporary states and, through their impact on the \noverall dynamic of the capitalist economy, a growing disjunction between a \npotentially global space of flows and the place-boundedness of a territorially \nsegmented political system. Temporally this limits the typical state's ability to react \naccording to its own routines and modes of calculation \u2013 which is why many state \nmanagers feel the pressures of globalization and believe they have lost operational \nautonomy. Likewise, spatially, given the porosity of borders to many different kinds of \nflow and the growing mobility of capital over a range of transnational scales, states \nfind it increasingly hard, should they want to, to contain economic, political, and \nsocial processes within their borders or control flows across these borders. These \nchanges are related in turn to a growing fragmentation of the westphalian state \nsystem to the extent, indeed, that some commentators suggest it is being re-placed \nby a neo-medieval system (e.g., Anderson 1996; Cerny 1997; Ruggie 1993).  \n \n 48\nIn the short-term these spatio-temporal changes reduce the capacity of states and \npolitical systems in general to follow their normal operating procedures in responding \nto major economic events \u2013 which tends to produce a sense of crisis or \npowerlessness. This is reflected in reactive fire-fighting, a turn towards short-term \nemergency measures or more durable 'states of exception', and fatalistic submission \nto the demands of (potentially) mobile capital. In the medium term, however, as a \nself-organizing, self-substituting system, more effective responses to this tendential \nerosion of operational autonomy should develop, get selected, and become \nstabilized. These could well arise from 'chance discoveries' and random variation \nbut, provided that the economic environment is relatively stable, they should become \nconsolidated. This process will be characterized by structural coupling and blind co-\nevolution, of course; but, within certain limits, it can also be reflexively guided and \nstrategically co-ordinated. Over time it may lead to new historic blocs and new \nunstable equilibria of compromise on a global scale. Before addressing such \npossibilities, however, let us consider the more general forms of the reorganization of \nthe state and the political system.  \n \nThis re-organization can be expected to include the following analytically distinct but \nempirically interrelated and often overlapping changes: \n\u2022 a dialectic of de-territorialization and re-territorialization of specific powers in \nthe political system, hence a reshaping of national states qua mutually \nexclusive, formally sovereign, spatially segmented instantiations of the \nwestphalian order, the transfer of powers previously located at this territorial \nlevel upwards, downwards, or sideways, and the allocation of new powers to \ndifferent scales;  \n\u2022 a dialectic of de-statization and re-statization as the internal demarcation \nwithin the institutional ensemble of political power is redefined and activities \nare re-allocated across this division; \n\u2022 a re-articulation of the relationship between territorial and functional spaces in \nthe political system, with implications for the significance of territorial 'power \ncontainers' on any scale as opposed to non-territorial forms of political power;  \n\u2022 a redefinition of the boundaries and division of labour between the political \nand economic systems in securing the reproduction-r\u00e9gulation of the capital \n 49\nrelation to take account of the re-articulation of the economic and extra-\neconomic in an era of increasing systemic and\/or structural competition;  \n\u2022 a re-ordering of political hierarchies associated with the relativization of scale \nnoted above \u2013 with implications for the restructuring of international relations, \ndomestic relations, and the interrelations between them; \n\u2022 a re-imagination of the political communities (or publics) to which the political \nsystem is oriented together with new state projects to redefine the nature and \npurposes of the state and new hegemonic projects to redefine the imagined \ngeneral interest of these new political communities. \n \nI will now offer some brief comments on each of these axes of reorganization and \ntheir interconnections in relation to the globalizing capitalist economy. But it is first \nnecessary to caution against treating states as if they were identical units. For the \nformal sovereignty accorded to national territorial states in the westphalian system \ndoes not imply any substantive identity or equality among them in terms of their \ncapacities for exercising power internally and\/or in the international arena. They will \nbe presented with different problems by the multi-scalar, multi-temporal, multi-centric \nprocesses that generate globalization; and they will have different capacities to \naddress these problems and reorganize themselves in response. Moreover, whereas \nthe form-determined condensation of forces in some states leads state managers to \nresist globalization, other states are clearly heavily committed to promoting it in one \nform or another. I have already commented above on different scalar strategies in \nthis regard and will not repeat these comments. Suffice to say that leading states are \nassociated with different globalization projects and that less powerful states will often \nseek to position their economic spaces and actors more favourably within more \nspecific local, regional, or functional niches within the emerging global division of \nlabour. In so doing some states will reinforce their hegemony or dominance within \nthe inter-state system, others will fall further down the inter-state hierarchy. In \nparticular, after worries were expressed about its declining hegemony in the wake of \nthe crisis of Atlantic Fordism, the USA has clearly gained in global influence in recent \nyears through its identification with and promotion of globalization in its own image. \n \nFirst, then, de- and re-territorialization are occurring. Given the primacy of the \n 50\nnational scale in the advanced capitalist economies in the era of Atlantic Fordism, \nthis can be described as the 'hollowing out' of the national state or, in more formal \nterms, as the de-nationalization of statehood. Thus the complex articulation of \nglobal-regional-national-local economies is linked to the transfer of powers \npreviously exercised by national states upwards to supra-regional or international \nbodies, downwards to regional or local states, or outwards to relatively autonomous \ncross-national alliances among local metropolitan or regional states with \ncomplementary interests. The post-war primacy of the national scale of state power \ndepended on the coincidence of national economy, national state, national \ncitizenship, and national society and on the national state's survival as a sovereign \nbody able to secure this coincidence. This structured coherence and its associated \nspatio-temporal fixes have been weakened by many of the processes usually \nsubsumed under the rubric of globalization. The national economy has been \nundermined by internationalization, the growth of multi-tiered global city networks, \nthe formation of triad economies (such as the European Union), and the re-\nemergence of regional and local economies in national states. In addition, the unity \nof the nation-state has been weakened by the (admittedly uneven) growth of multi-\nethnic and multi-cultural societies and of divided political loyalties (with the \nresurgence of regionalism and nationalism as the rise of European identities, \ndiasporic networks, cosmopolitan patriotism, etc.) (Jessop 1999a). \n \nSecond, there is a process of de- and re-statization. This involves the re-allocation of \nfunctions across the internal demarcation between public and private responsibilities \nwithin each territorialized political system. This is often described as a shift from \ngovernment to governance but this slogan is misleading to the extent that it depicts \nthe shifts as essentially one-way. In practice there may well be an asymmetrical shift \nin this direction but there is also traffic in the other direction as new responsibilities \nare acquired by states on different scales. \n \nThird, there are changes in the relationship between territorialized and functionalized \nmodes of exercising political power. At stake here is not the transfer of powers \nbetween different scales (including new ones) of territorialized power ('hollowing out') \nbut the growth of modes of exercising power that do not depend on imperative co-\nordination by a territorialized state apparatus and that are independent of its borders \n 51\non whatever scale they exist.  This process is often subsumed under the rubric of the \nshift from government to governance but it differs from the second set of changes \nnoted above in being essentially extra-territorial and in dissociating the exercise of \npolitical power from imagined political communities whose interests are tied to \nterritorialized state power. One way to distinguish between the second and third \nprocesses is to consider de-statization as involving public-private partnerships in \nwhich the state devolves responsibilities to the private sphere but attempts to remain \nprimus inter pares; and to consider the growth of functionalized forms of power as \ninvolving self-organization that by-passes or circumvents state power \u2013 perhaps at \nthe behest of state managers. The increasing importance of international regimes to \nthe relative stabilization of a globalizing economy and the rise of cybernetworks in an \nextra-territorial, telematic space allegedly beyond state control are two contrasting \nexamples of third process.  \n \nFourth, there has also been expansion in the imagined scope and inclusiveness of \nthe economy that needs governing through states, public-private partnerships, or \nfunctional networks. The economy is no longer interpreted in narrow terms but has \nbeen extended to include many additional factors, deemed 'non-economic' under the \nKWNS regime, that affect economic performance. This expansion is reflected in \nconcepts such as 'structural competitiveness' (Chesnais 1987) or 'systemic \ncompetitiveness' (Messner 1997) \u2013 concepts that highlight the combined impact of \ndiverse societal factors on competitiveness. This requires attention to a growing \nrange of economically relevant practices, institutions, functional systems, and \ndomains of the lifeworld to enhance competitiveness. This has two interesting and \nparadoxical effects on states and politics that are reflected in the two preceding sets \nof changes. First, whilst it expands the potential scope of state intervention for \neconomic purposes, the resulting complexity renders post-war top-down intervention \nless effective \u2013 requiring that the state retreat from some areas of intervention and \nre-invent itself as a condition for more effective intervention in others (Messner \n1997). And, second, whilst it increases the range of stakeholders whose cooperation \nis required for successful state intervention, it also increases pressures within the \nstate to create new subjects to act as its partners. Thus states are now trying to \ntransform the identities, interests, capacities, rights, and responsibilities of economic \nand social forces so that they become more flexible, capable, and reliable agents of \n 52\nthe state's new economic strategies \u2013 whether in partnership with the state and\/or \nwith each other or as autonomous entrepreneurial subjects in the new knowledge-\ndriven economy (Barry et al., 1996; Deakin and Edwards 1993; Jones 1999). \n \nFifth, political hierarchies are being re-ordered. The nested hierarchy of state power \nwithin territorially exclusive sovereign states and formal equality among such states \nwas, of  course, never fully realized in the westphalian system; but it did provide the \ninstitutional architecture within which forces struggled for control of state power and \nattempted to modify the balance of power in international relations. The \ndecomposition of national spatio-temporal fixes, the de-nationalization of statehood \nand the dual de-statization of politics (i.e., the shifting internal demarcation between \npublic and private and the growth of functional power networks) have since \ncontributed to a relativization of scale and an increasingly convoluted, tangled, and \neccentric set of relations among different scales of political organization. The \nstructural coherence of the Atlantic Fordist spatio-temporal fix has decomposed and \nthere is a marked degree of unstructured complexity as different scales of economic \nand political organization proliferate and different scale strategies are pursued. \n \nSixth, the political communities (or publics) towards which forces in the political \nsystem orient their actions are being re-imagined. These include, but are not \nexhausted by: new 'imagined nations' oriented to autonomy within and\/or control of a \ndefined territory below, above, or transversal to existing national states; a global civil \nsociety premised on cosmopolitan patriotism, the primacy of human rights over \nnational citizenship, or some other global identity; new 'communities of fate' defined \nby shared risks regardless of specific territorial location and, perhaps, global in \ncharacter (e.g., the risks generated by global warming); and new communities of \ninterest defined by shared identities, interests, and values regardless of specific \nterritorial location (e.g., cybercommunities). Such new territorial or extra-territorial \nconceptions of political community are linked to struggles to redefine the nature and \npurposes of the state, to find alternatives to territorialized forms of political power, \nand to redefine the imagined general interest which political power, whether territorial \nor not, should serve.  \n \nSo far I have described these shifts in general terms. I now want to make two further, \n 53\nfinal points about the ecological dominance of the capitalist economy in a global era \nand about states' capacities to reorganize themselves in response to globalization. \nLet me deal first with the adaptive capacities of states. Each of the six trends noted \nabove has been alleged to involve a decline in the powers of the dominant forms of \nstate associated with the Atlantic Fordist era. Whether or not this is true in the short-\nterm, it does not exclude creative adaptation to the erosion of state power. The \nviability of such responses nonetheless depends either on their compatibility with the \necological dominance of the capitalist economy or their ability to contest, resist, and \nreverse this dominance. Which of these alternatives comes to dominate depends in \nturn on political struggles and this will determine the subsequent structural coupling \nand co-evolution of the economic and political systems on a global scale. \n \nThe de-nationalization of statehood and the re-ordering of political hierarchies are \nboth associated with an enhanced role for national states in interscalar management, \ni.e., attempts to control the articulation of scales and the transfer of powers between \nthem. This applies to the forms and scope of functional networks and cyberspace(s) \nand the activities that occur within them as well as to the re-articulation of terrestrial \nand territorial scales. Thus national states have an important role in the production \nand regulation of extra-territorial spaces, such as offshore financial centres, export \nprocessing zones, flagging out, and tax havens. For this 'create[s] spaces of \ndifferential regulation within and across states that add to the functionality of the \nborder as much as they contradict it' (Cameron and Palan 1999: 280) and thereby \nhelps to lubricate global flows of capital. States are likewise involved in the \ndevelopment and institutionalization of the new lex mercatoria because this has \ndistinct strategic selectivities that differentially affect states and the economic spaces \nwith which they are associated. Similar points obtain for the emerging governance of \ncyberspace (Loader 1997; Kahin and Keller 1997; Kahin and Nesson 1997; Saco \n1999). Other levels of state may also try to engage in interscalar management but \neven the European Union, the most advanced supranational state apparatus, still \nlacks the powers and legitimacy to do this to the same extent as national states \u2013 \nespecially larger member states. This does not exclude strategic alliances among \nstates on various scales to steer interscalar articulation or an eventual new scale of \nterritorial state that has acquired the necessary powers and legitimacy to co-ordinate \nthe proliferating scales of action and to institutionalize new spatio-temporal fixes \n 54\naround this new primary scale. Indeed at least one commentator has already \ndiscerned the emergence of a global state (admittedly orchestrated by the USA) that \nis superseding the 'western state' that presided over the Atlantic Fordist era (Shaw \n1997). Whether this is really better understood as a new primary scale on which \npolitical power is being territorialized or as an important emerging secondary scale \n(or nodal point) around which national states seek to pool their sovereignty in pursuit \nof common interests is open to discussion. In either case it would clearly involve new \nforms of parallel power network and strategic co-ordination to ensure the overall \ninstitutional integration and strategic coherence of policies pursued at this level. My \nown view is that the trends that Shaw identifies are currently part of the overall \nrelativization of scale and therefore feed into the competition to define a new primary \nscale of action rather than resolve it.  \n \nLikewise, regarding the dual shift from government to governance, there is a \ncounter-trend in the shift from government to meta-governance (or, better, meta-\nsteering). For even as states cede their claim to sovereignty in the face of growing \ncomplex interdependence and seek to enhance their political capacities by \nparticipating in heterarchic co-ordination mechanisms or devolving some activities to \nprivate institutions and actors, they also seek to shape and steer these mechanisms \nthrough meta-steering practices. Thus states (on various scales) tend to get more \ninvolved in organizing the self-organization of partnerships, networks, and regimes. \nThey provide the ground rules for governance; ensure the compatibility of different \ngovernance mechanisms and regimes; deploy a relative monopoly of organizational \nintelligence and information with which to shape cognitive expectations; act as a \n'court of appeal' for disputes arising within and over governance; seek to re-balance \npower differentials by strengthening weaker forces or systems in the interests of \nsystem integration and\/or social cohesion; try to modify the self-understanding of \nidentities, strategic capacities, and interests of individual and collective actors in \ndifferent strategic contexts and hence alter their implications for preferred strategies \nand tactics; and also assume political responsibility in the event of governance \nfailure. Of course, meta-steering is prone to failure just like markets, states, and \ngovernance mechanisms. But, insofar as they do succeed, however relatively, their \nsuccess will depend on their fit with (and contribution to) the stabilization of the new \n(or newly redefined) objects of regulation and governance. \n 55\n \nThe expanded definition of the economic to include factors previously regarded as \nextra-economic clearly involves a key role for states (on whatever scale) in mediating \nthis re-articulation, steering the resulting commodification and re-commodification of \nsocial relations, and dealing with the consequences of the increasing ecological \ndominance of capitalist logic on social cohesion and social exclusion. Moreover, \nwhereas the promotion of the micro-social conditions for capital accumulation in \nthese changing circumstances may well be better handled at other levels than the \nnational, problems of territorial integration, social cohesion, and social exclusion are \ncurrently still best handled at the level of the large territorial national state.21 For the \nlatter is still currently non-substitutable given its fisco-financial powers and its scope \nfor redistributive politics in re-arranging spatio-temporal fixes.22  \n \nThe emergence of new imagined political communities is too complex to discuss in \ndetail here but it is certainly worth noting how they are shaped by the growing \necological dominance of the capitalist economy within the system and lifeworlds. \nThis is associated with the intensification of the contradictions of capitalism on a \nglobal scale \u2013 especially when system assumes neo-liberal form \u2013 and invites the \nrescaling of political communities and their responses to the resulting perturbations. \nThe relativization of scale is likewise linked to the search for new spatio-temporal \nfixes on various scales and these always involve deferring and displacing the \nmaterial and social costs of the fix and its associated institutionalized compromises \nonto marginal classes, strata, social categories, and spaces. These processes also \nlead to projects to brake, resist, or overturn the dominance of the globalizing \ncapitalist economy and\/or to complement it through the development of new forms of \n                                            \n21 The national states of small open economies may lack the resources to \ncompensate for the consequences of globalization and the demands of systemic \ncompetitiveness \u2013 especially where there are neo-liberal pressures to reduce the \nfisco-financial powers of the state. In this context there may a bigger role for \ninternational cooperation or emergent regional states such as the European Union.  \n22 Indeed, as Lefebrve noted, '[o]nly the state can take on the task of managing \nspace \"on a grand scale\"' (Lefebvre 1978: 298, cited in Brenner 1997). \n. \n 56\nglobal governance. \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \nThis contribution has traversed much ground over many different scales and levels \nof analysis. And, given my scepticism about much work on this theme, it has not put \nglobalization at the heart of the analysis. Instead it has attempted to situate \nglobalization as a complex, chaotic, and overdetermined outcome of a multi-scalar, \nmulti-temporal, and multi-centric series of processes operating in specific structural \ncontexts and to assess the implications of the emergence of the global as the \nultimate horizon of action in the economic and political systems. This explains why \nglobalization often figures only tangentially in the preceding analysis. Indeed, insofar \nas the global is merely one scalar viewpoint from which to describe the complex, \ntangled, and interdependent re-scaling of capital accumulation or the changing \nstructural coupling and co-evolution of the economic and political, globalization could \nhave been written out of the script entirely at many points without losing the force of \nmany of the theoretical and substantive arguments. For they could also have been \nillustrated in terms of changing forms of localization, regionalization, nationalization, \ntriadization, cross-borderization, and so forth. Nonetheless a focus on globalization is \njustified insofar as the global is more than just one scalar viewpoint among many but \nactually involves significant qualitative shifts in the overall dynamic of capitalism and \nits structural coupling and co-evolution of the economic and political. I have argued \nstrongly for the latter conclusions on three main grounds. \n \nFirst, the dominant neo-liberal form of capitalist globalization significantly enhances \nthe generic tendencies of the capitalism economy to become the ecologically \ndominant system in global social order. Second, globalization has contributed \nsignificantly to the disruption and decomposition of the primarily national spatio-\ntemporal fixes that provided the framework in which the Atlantic Fordist accumulation \nregimes and their modes of regulation were established and consolidated. And, third, \nowing to the relativization of scale and the growing spatio-temporal complexities with \nwhich globalization is associated, no new spatio-temporal fix has yet emerged within \nwhich the illogic of the dominant neo-liberal form of globalization as reflected in its \nincreasing contradictions, global-local disorder, and growing social polarization and \n 57\nsocial exclusion could be tamed and through which global economic governance \ncould be established.    \n \nIn pursuing these arguments in a much broader theoretical context I hope to have \nprovided some substantive arguments that will serve as correctives to many of the \nmore orthodox accounts of globalization. These arguments concern changes in \ncapital accumulation and the state and their connection to globalization. They can be \ncondensed into six main themes that will be presented here in telegrammatic form.  \n \nThe first theme is that of globalization as a 'chaotic conception'. Globalization is not \nan homogenous or homogenizing process; it is not a singular causal mechanism; it \ndoes not emanate from, nor is it initiated from, all points on the globe; and it does not \ndevelop evenly. Instead it is a contradictory, conflictual, contested, and complex \nresultant of multi-scalar, multi-temporal, multi-centric processes that develops \nunevenly in time and space, and, indeed, exploits and intensifies differences as \nmuch as, if not more than, it produces new complementarities and uniformities.  \n \nThe second theme concerns the importance of studying globalization at different \nlevels of analysis from the systemic and inter-systemic through the institutional and \ninter-institutional and then the organizational and inter-organizational down to the \npersonal and interpersonal. In particular I argued for a treatment of globalization as \nan emergent feature of the capitalist economy as a whole rather than of individual \neconomic actors or specific territorial units. For globalization, as I define it, emerges \nfrom the interconnections among different actors on many different scales and is \nintensified through new forms of time-space distantiation and time-space \ncompression. An important contributing factor here is, of course, the increased \nsalience of the global as the ultimate horizon of action of a growing number of actors \nbut even this does not require that all these actors then act on a global scale.  \n \nThe third theme concerns the importance of studying the complex relations between \nthe two systems with the strongest capacities for ecological dominance within an \nemerging global society. These are the capitalist economy considered as an \nautopoietic system with its own profit-oriented operational code and institutional logic \norganized around the self-valorization of capital; and the political system considered \n 58\nas an autopoietic system with its own power-oriented operational code and \ninstitutional logic organized around the self-reproduction of ruling-ruled relations and \nterritorialization of power. Their relations are complex because of the constitutive \nincompleteness of the capital relation in the real world such that its reproduction-\nr\u00e9gulation depends, in an unstable and contradictory way, on changing extra-\neconomic conditions; and because the political system in capitalist social formations \ncannot produce key material resources for the performance of its political functions \nbut depends on revenues generated from a capitalist economy whose overall \ndynamic it cannot control.  This interdepence between operationally autonomous but \nsubstantively interdependent systems underpins the structural coupling, strategic co-\nordination, and overall co-evolution of the economic and political orders and, under \nthe ecological dominance of the capitalist economy, gives rise to the apparent base-\nsuperstructure relations in capitalist societies so beloved of orthodox marxism.  \n \nThe fourth theme is the importance for the reproduction-r\u00e9gulation of a constitutively \nincomplete capital relation of securing specific spatio-temporal fixes within which its \ncontradictions and dilemmas can be managed. These serve to displace and\/or defer \ncertain aspects of these contradictions and dilemmas either within the boundaries of \nthe spatio-temporal fix (onto marginal classes, strata, or social categories) or beyond \nthem (onto other economic and political spaces). This is where questions of scale \nenter crucially into the analysis and it is important to study how scales are continually \ncreated and interconnected in new ways rather than seeing them as pre-given and \nunchanging.  Similar arguments hold for the temporal aspects of spatio-temporal \nfixes. \n \nThe fifth theme concerns the growing ecological dominance of the capitalist \neconomy. This has many different causes. Indeed, given the always relational and \nrelative nature of ecological dominance, it certainly could not be reduced purely to \nchanges within the economic domain. Nonetheless, among these different causes, \nsome of the emergent features of globalization \u2013 especially in its dominant neo-\nliberal form \u2013 do contribute significantly to this ecological dominance. In insisting on \nthe complex nature of globalization as a resultant, however, I am also challenging \nthe fatalism that comes from seeing it as an overwhelming, singular causal force. \nFor, once we recognize its complexities, examine its different mechanisms, and \n 59\nappreciate how they are instantiated on many different scales of action, there is \nscope for struggles to resist globalization and\/or to change its dominant forms. This \nleads us to my final topic. \n \nThe sixth theme concerns the response of the political system to the increasing \necological dominance of a globalizing capitalist economy. This has two very different \nfaces. On the one hand, given the inherent inability of the capitalist economy to \nachieve self-closure and its need to be socially embedded within a market society \nand supported by state power, capitalist globalization is inconceivable without active \ninvolvement of at least some states in promoting the conditions for globalization. On \nthe other hand, the existing institutional architecture of the state system and the \nmore general spatio-temporal matrix of political routines make it difficult for the states \nand political systems that sustained accumulation regimes in the era of Atlantic \nFordism to manage the transition to a new wave of accumulation on a more global \nscale or to cope with its consequences. In particular, the dominant, neo-liberal form \nof globalization and its associated 'politics of scale' intensify capital's basic structural \ncontradictions and strategic dilemmas. This is reflected in struggles among different \nfractions of capital as well as in disputes within leading international economic and \npolitical agencies charged with global economic governance. It provides the context \nfor a continuing and still unresolved search process to find new forms of state and \nnew modes of governance on different scales to secure new spatio-temporal fixes \nwithin which accumulation on a world scale can be maintained \u2013 or to find new forms \nof state and new modes of governance with which to brake the (il)logics of \naccumulation on a world scale and develop alternative ways of organizing global-\nlocal order. New projects for global governance, whether rooted in markets, states, \nor civil society, are unlikely to succeed as long as neo-liberal accumulation strategies \nare still dominant. But this does not justify resignation, fatalism, or a do-nothing \napproach. Instead it calls for a reflexive, ironic 'optimism of the will' as a necessary \ncomplement to 'pessimism of the intellect'. Indeed, given the conflictual, antagonistic \nnature of the globalization-regionalization dialectic, it always confronts forms of \nresistance and structural limits that make a fully constituted globality hard to imagine \n(Altvater and Mahnkopf 1996). It seems appropriate to conclude by repeating one of \nGramsci's comments in a new conjuncture: 'the old is dying, the new cannot be born' \n. \n 60\nBob Jessop (R.Jessop@lancs.ac.uk), Department of Sociology, Lancaster \nUniversity, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YL, United Kingdom. \n \nReferences  \n \nAlbritton, R.
