Although no 3 \nchanges to the concentrations of UV-B photoprotective pigments were detected 4 \nduring snowmelt, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations and maximum 5 \nphotosystem (PS)II yield (Fv\/Fm) were respectively 88%, 60% and 144% higher in the 6 \ntissues of the liverwort that had recently emerged from snow than in those under a 10 7 \ncm depth of snow. A laboratory experiment similarly showed that effective PSII yield 8 \nincreased rapidly within the first 45 min after plants sampled from under snow were 9 \nremoved to an illuminated growth cabinet. The pigmentation and PSII yields of plants 10 \nduring snowmelt were also compared with those of plants in January, during the 11 \nmiddle of the growing season at Rothera Point. During snowmelt, plants had lower 12 \nFv\/Fm values, chlorophyll a \/ b ratios and concentrations of UV-B photoprotective 13 \npigments and carotenoids than during mid-season, suggesting that although there is 14 \nsome recovery of PSII activity and increases in concentrations of photosynthetic 15 \npigments during snowmelt, the metabolism of C. varians is restricted during this 16 \nperiod.17 \n 3 \nIntroduction  1 \nMost terrestrial habitats in the Maritime Antarctic are snow- and ice-covered for the 2 \nmajority of the year. Periods of biological activity are thought to be restricted to 3 \naustral late spring and summer, when mean air temperatures are marginally positive 4 \nand snow and ice has melted (Convey 2001). Snowmelt in these habitats typically 5 \noccurs between November and December, at the beginning of the summer. This is a 6 \nchallenging time for Antarctic plants. Metabolism must recover rapidly in order to 7 \nmaximise carbon acquisition during the short growing season, but has to do so under 8 \nthe stresses associated with the snowmelt period, notably high radiative doses, 9 \ndesiccation, exposure to freeze-thaw events, and low soil and air temperatures 10 \n(Oberbauer and Starr 2002). 11 \nInitial biological activity occurs when snowmelt begins and plants become 12 \nrehydrated, a process that can occur while plants are still covered with snow 13 \n(Oberbauer and Starr 2002; Schlensog et al. 2004). The second stage in metabolic 14 \nrecovery occurs when the insulating layer of snow and ice above plants melts, 15 \nexposing them to full solar irradiance. This includes not only photosynthetically 16 \nactive radiation (PAR; 400 \u2013 700 nm) but also biologically damaging UV-B radiation 17 \n(280 \u2013 315 nm), both of which are absorbed by snow and ice. For example, a 10 cm 18 \ndepth of snow absorbs c. 80% of erythemally-weighted UV-B radiation (Cockell et al. 19 \n2002), but still allows up to c. 60% of PAR to penetrate, which is sufficient to drive 20 \nsubnivean photosynthesis of lichens in the sub-Arctic (Kappen et al. 1995). 21 \nPrevious studies have investigated the photosynthetic responses to desiccation 22 \nand subsequent hydration of poikilohydric plants, typically lichens (e.g. Kappen and 23 \nBreuer 1991; Kappen et al. 1995; Schlensog et al. 2004) but also mosses (Wasley et 24 \nal. 2006). These studies, which have usually been conducted in the laboratory, have 25 \n 4 \nfound that the water content of lichen thalli or moss shoots has a strong effect on gas 1 \nexchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence yield, and have concluded that desiccated 2 \nthalli or shoots under deep layers of snow and ice are most probably physiologically 3 \ninactive (e.g. Kappen 1993). However little is known about the effects of snowmelt on 4 \nthe metabolism of poikilohydric plants in the field, owing to the difficulties of 5 \nmeasuring photosynthetic parameters under ice and snow cover. An exception to this 6 \nis the study of Pannewitz et al. (2003), who measured the chlorophyll fluorescence of 7 \nundisturbed lichens in the continental Antarctic during snowmelt by leaving fibre 8 \noptic cables in close proximity to thalli in the previous summer. They found that the 9 \nlichens only became active when they began to emerge from snow and thallus 10 \ntemperatures approached the freezing point of water. 11 \nMost of the available data in the literature on the responses of plant 12 \npigmentation to snowmelt, caused by the altered microclimate as plants emerge from 13 \nmelting snow and ice, are derived from work on Arctic and alpine vascular plant 14 \nspecies. Although the constantly-hydrated state of homoiohydrous vascular plant 15 \nspecies hampers comparisons with poikilohydric plants (Kappen 1993), several 16 \nchanges to the pigmentation of poikilohydric species can be anticipated from the 17 \nvascular plant literature. For example, concentrations of photosynthetic pigments are 18 \nlikely to increase in poikilohydric plant tissues as they emerge from snow (Kimball et 19 \nal. 1973; Oberbauer and Starr 2002). Similarly, those of UV-B photoprotective 20 \npigments such as anthocyanins, pigments that attenuate UV-B radiation and which are 21 \nalso known to be associated with chilling and desiccation tolerance (Chalker-Scott 22 \n1999; Gould 2004), are likely to increase in plant tissues as they emerge from melting 23 \nsnow and ice (Oberbauer and Starr 2002).  24 \n 5 \nThis study aimed to identify changes occurring to the metabolism of the 1 \npoikilohydric leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians during snowmelt in late spring at 2 \nRothera Point on the western Antarctic Peninsula. We measured chlorophyll a 3 \nfluorescence parameters and concentrations of pigments in hydrated C. varians tissues 4 \nto determine changes to the liverwort\u2019s physiology as it emerged from melting snow. 5 \nWe anticipated that chlorophyll fluorescence yield would increase during this period, 6 \nand, because of the rapid response of photoprotective pigments to changes in UV-B 7 \nradiation recorded in previous studies (Newsham et al. 2002, 2005), that 8 \nconcentrations of an anthocyanin-like pigment and UV-B screening pigments would 9 \nincrease in C. varians tissues during snowmelt. A growth cabinet experiment was also 10 \nperformed to simulate the effects of rapid snowmelt on the photosynthetic yield of C. 11 \nvarians. Finally, we compared the photosynthetic yield and pigmentation of plants 12 \nmeasured during snowmelt with those of plants during the middle of the growing 13 \nseason at Rothera Point, to determine whether or not full recovery occurs immediately 14 \nafter emergence from snow. 15 \n 16 \nMaterials and methods 17 \nSite description 18 \nThe population of C. varians that was studied forms an extensive (c. 10 m\n2\n) mat in a 19 \nlow-lying (c. 5 m a.s.l.) gully at Rothera Point on the Wright Peninsula, Adelaide 20 \nIsland (67\u00b0 34\u2019 S, 68\u00b0 07\u2019 W), c. 100 m from the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s Rothera 21 \nResearch Station. Between March and November plants in the gully are normally 22 \npermanently covered with snow to depths of 0.2 \u2013 1.0 m. Snowmelt at the site 23 \nnormally begins in late October, when, under clear skies, a permanent ice cornice in 24 \nthe gully releases meltwater and hydrates the mat of C. varians, including that under 25 \n 6 \nsnow and ice, below it. During the austral summer the plants are exposed to direct 1 \nsolar radiation between c. 10:00 and 19:00 hrs (local time). 2 \n 3 \nSnow cover, temperature, irradiance and ozone column depth measurements 4 \nAmbient air temperatures were recorded every 5 min by two platinum resistance 5 \nthermometers (PT100; Labfacility Ltd., Teddington, UK), within a standard 6 \nStevenson screen situated 180 m from the gully. Broad-band UV-B and PAR sensors 7 \n(model nos. SKU 430 and SKP 215, respectively; Skye Instruments Ltd, Llandrindod 8 \nWells, UK) monitored the irradiance received every 5 min at the surface of the C. 9 \nvarians mat in the gully. In addition, two of the same sensors installed close to the site 10 \nsynchronously measured irradiances of UV-B and PAR at 3 m above ground level. 11 \nThe depth of snow covering the broadband sensors at the study site was measured 12 \nweekly using snow stakes from July 2005 until the snow ablated in spring. The 13 \noutputs from the UV-B and PAR sensors were cross-calibrated with data from a 14 \ndouble monochromator grating spectroradiometer (Bentham DM150; Bentham 15 \nInstruments Ltd., Reading, UK) situated in a laboratory 340 m from the gully. The 16 \nspectroradiometer recorded global spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm every 17 \n30 min throughout the study period. It was calibrated against a 1000 W quartz-18 \nhalogen tungsten coil filament lamp that meets US National Institute of Standards and 19 \nTechnology standards. Spectral data were expressed as biologically effective UV-B 20 \n(UV-BBE) weighted with the generalized plant action spectrum (Caldwell 1971) and 21 \nnormalized to 1 at 300 nm, or as the flux of PAR. Overpass measurements of ozone 22 \ncolumn depths over Rothera Point were obtained from the Ozone Monitoring 23 \nInstrument, situated aboard the NASA Aura satellite (http:\/\/toms.gsfc.nasa.gov). 24 \n 25 \n 7 \nMeasurements during snowmelt 1 \nPlants were sampled as they emerged from melting snow in November 2005. In order 2 \nto mark the positions of the plants prior to them being covered with snow in autumn, 2 3 \nm length bamboo canes were laid on the ground next to four areas of healthy C. 4 \nvarians mat in March 2005. In November 2005, during the spring thaw, each cane 5 \nwas marked at solar noon (13:30 hrs local time) to indicate the horizontal distance that 6 \nthe snow had melted back along it during the first day on which it became exposed, 7 \nand subsequently every 24 h afterwards for 6 d. Two canes became exposed on 10 8 \nNovember and the other two on 15 November.  9 \nA pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer (Mini-PAM, Heinz Walz GmbH, 10 \nEffeltrich, Germany) was used to measure chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters of 11 \nplants at solar noon on 21 November 2005. Measurements were made on plant 12 \nmaterial that had emerged 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 d previously from snow. Control 13 \nmeasurements were also made in four areas after removing the 10 cm depth of snow 14 \ncovering each sample. All plants, including those under snow, were hydrated (tissue 15 \nmoisture contents c. 88% of fresh weight) when the measurements were made. 16 \nMinimal chlorophyll a fluorescence (Fo) and maximum fluorescence (Fm), induced by 17 \na 0.8 s saturating flash, were recorded after dark adaptation for 20 min, achieved by 18 \ncovering the plants with a thick, close-weave dark cloth. Maximum PSII yield (Fv\/Fm) 19 \nand the non-photosynthetic quenching coefficient qN, a measure of heat dissipation 20 \nfrom PSII (Maxwell and Johnson 2000), were subsequently calculated.  21 \nOn 21 November, a single sample (c. 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm) of mat was excised 22 \nwith a knife from adjacent to each of the six points marked along each cane. On two 23 \noccasions, there had been no recession along a cane on a given day, in which case no 24 \nsample was collected. Four samples on which control measurements had been made 25 \n 8 \nwere also excised. A total of 26 samples were hence collected. Each sample was 1 \nplaced into a sterile plastic bag and kept in the dark while being transferred to the 2 \nlaboratory at Rothera Research Station. Immediately after transfer to the laboratory, 3 \neach sample was frozen at -80\uf0b0C and was subsequently dried in a ModulyoD freeze 4 \ndrier (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The uppermost 2-3 mm of tissue 5 \nwas then cut from each sample with a scalpel and two sub-samples of 25 mg were 6 \nground in liquid nitrogen. UV-B screening pigments and the anthocyanin-like pigment 7 \nwere extracted from one sub-sample into 4 ml of methanol, water and HCl (70:20:1), 8 \nand chlorophylls and carotenoids were extracted from the second sub-sample into 3 9 \nml of methanol, using the methods described by Newsham et al. (2002). Sample 10 \npreparation and analyses were conducted in dim light and over ice in order to avoid 11 \npigment degradation. 12 \nExtracts were immediately diluted with the appropriate solvent, transferred to 13 \nquartz semi-microcuvettes and absorbances were measured in a spectrophotometer 14 \n(Helios \uf067, Thermo Electron Corp.). To estimate concentrations of UV-B screening 15 \npigments, the absorbance of each acidified methanol extract was measured between 16 \n280 and 315 nm (1 nm step). The concentration of the anthocyanin-like pigment was 17 \nestimated by measuring the absorbance of acidified methanol extracts at 495 nm (Post 18 \nand Vesk 1992). Concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were expressed as the 19 \narea under the absorbance curve (AUC280-315) per mg dry weight of tissue. Data for the 20 \nanthocyanin-like pigment were expressed as A495 per mg dry weight. To estimate 21 \nconcentrations of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids, absorbances of methanol 22 \nextracts were measured at 470, 653 and 666 nm, and concentrations of pigments were 23 \ncalculated from standard formulae (Lichtenthaler and Wellburn 1983). Weights of 24 \n 9 \nchlorophylls and carotenoids extracted per gram dry weight of tissue were 1 \nsubsequently calculated.  2 \n 3 \nGrowth cabinet experiment  4 \nA hydrated sample of C. varians mat was excised from under a 10 cm depth of snow 5 \non 16 November 2005. The sample was kept in the dark and transferred to a growth 6 \ncabinet in a laboratory at Rothera Research Station within a few minutes. The growth 7 \ncabinet (Fitotron, Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC, Loughborough, UK) was set to 4 \u00baC, with 8 \n25% humidity and UV-B, UV-A and PAR irradiances of 0.961, 2.100 and 181.74 W 9 \nm\n2\n, respectively. Effective quantum yield of photochemistry (\uf046PSII) was measured, as 10 \ndescribed above but without dark adaptation, at 2 min intervals for the first 10 min 11 \nafter transfer to the cabinet, at 5 min intervals for the following 50 min, at 30 min 12 \nintervals for the following 5 h and then every hour for the following 4 h. 13 \n 14 \nMid-season measurements 15 \nFully-hydrated samples of C. varians from the middle of the growing season were 16 \ncollected on seven consecutive days, beginning on 4 January 2006, from four plots 17 \n(0.5 \u00d7 0.5 m) located in the gully. Fv\/Fm measurements were made each day at solar 18 \nnoon in triplicate in each of the four plots, as described above. Concentrations of the 19 \nanthocyanin-like pigment and UV-B screening pigments were measured in one 20 \nsample of material from each plot on each of the seven days, also as described above. 21 \nOwing to limited availability of plant material, concentrations of chlorophyll and 22 \ncarotenoids were measured in plants collected from each plot on 4, 5 and 6 January 23 \nonly.  24 \n 25 \n 10 \nStatistical analyses 1 \nRank correlations were used to determine changes to the PSII yield and pigmentation 2 \nof plants as they emerged from melting snow. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation 3 \ncoefficient (rs) was calculated for the association between each of the response 4 \nvariates and time (number of days after emergence from snow) and the total doses of 5 \nUV-BBE, UV-A and PAR received since emergence. The same test was used to 6 \ndetermine associations between time and \uf046PSII in the growth cabinet experiment. 7 \nANOVA was used to compare the PSII yield and pigmentation of plants during 8 \nsnowmelt and in mid-season, and at different times during snowmelt. 9 \n 10 \nResults 11 \nSnow cover, temperature, irradiance and ozone column depth 12 \nC. varians in the gully at Rothera Point became covered with snow between late 13 \nMarch and early April 2005. Snow accumulation continued throughout the autumn 14 \nand winter until plants were covered with a c. 20 cm depth of snow in early October. 15 \nThe depth of snow covering the plants reduced by c. 5 cm wk\n-1\n from early October 16 \nuntil the plants adjacent to the canes started to emerge from snow on 10\n \nand 15 17 \nNovember. The minimum, mean and maximum horizontal rates at which snow 18 \nreceded along the canes during this period were 0, 25 and 40 cm d\n-1\n. Moderate 19 \nsnowfalls occurred between 10:00 and 13:00 hrs on 18 November. Areas that were 20 \npreviously uncovered accumulated no more than 1 cm depth of snow, which melted 21 \nwithin 30 min. Slight, intermittent snowfall also occurred between 09:00 and 13:00 22 \nhrs on 12 November and 18:00 and 20:00 hrs on 14 November. This snow melted 23 \nimmediately after falling. There was no precipitation between 4 and 10 January, other 24 \nthan intermittent snow between 09:00 and 11:00 hrs on 10\n \nJanuary. 25 \n 11 \nAir temperatures between 10\n \nand 21 November ranged between \u20135.2\u02daC and 1 \n+5.9\u02daC, and those between 4 and 10 January 2006 varied between \u20133.0\u02daC and +4.3\u02daC 2 \n(Fig. 1a). There was a significant increase in mean daily air temperature of 0.26\u02daC d-1 3 \nbetween 10 and 21 November (F1,10 = 5.37, P=0.043, r\n2\n = 34.9%) and a significant 4 \ndecrease of 0.48\u02daC d-1 between 4 and 10 January (F1,6 = 13.54, P=0.010, r\n2\n = 69.3%). 5 \nDaily mean air temperature did not differ between the study periods in November and 6 \nJanuary (F1,17 = 0.19; P=0.668). The ranges of UV-BBE and PAR fluxes received by 7 \nplants between 10\n \nand 21 November were 3.34 \u00d7 10\n-6 \u2013 1.3 \u00d7 10-1 and 3.0 \u00d7 10-2 \u2013 290 8 \nW m\n2\n, respectively (Fig. 1b, c). Those received between 4 and 10 January were 7.36 \u00d7 9 \n10\n-5 \n- 1.8 \u00d7 10\n-1\n and 7.0 \u00d7 10\n-2 \n- 200 W m\n2\n, respectively (Fig. 1b, c). Mean daily flux 10 \nof UV-BBE was 33% higher between 4 and 10 January than between 10 and 21 11 \nNovember (F1,17 = 8.82; P=0.009; Fig. 1b). In contrast, mean daily PAR flux was 25% 12 \nlower in January than in November (F1,17 = 11.04; P=0.004; Fig. 1c). Minimum, mean 13 \nand maximum ozone column depths over the study site between 10\n \nand 21 November 14 \nwere 310, 353 and 377 Dobson units and those between 4\n \nand 10 January were 266, 15 \n279 and 291 Dobson units (data not shown). Mean ozone column depth over Rothera 16 \nPoint was 21% lower in January than in November (F1,17 = 159.47, P<0.001). Data 17 \nfrom the broadband sensors indicated that a 10 cm depth of snow absorbed 80% of 18 \nboth PAR and UV-B radiation. 19 \n 20 \nMeasurements during snowmelt 21 \nThe maximum PSII yield of plants one day after emergence from snow was 144% 22 \nhigher (P<0.001) than that of plants sampled from under a 10 cm depth of snow (Fig. 23 \n2a). There was then no subsequent change in Fv\/Fm over the six days after the plants 24 \nhad emerged from snow (Fig. 2a). The quenching coefficient qN remained constant at 25 \n 12 \n0.26 (\u00b1 0.01) in plants under 10 cm of snow and in those that had emerged from snow 1 \n(data not shown). 2 \nThere were no significant associations between time since emergence from 3 \nsnow and any measures of pigmentation (Fig. 2b-e). The canes emerged from snow on 4 \ntwo different days, and therefore plants adjacent to different canes would not have 5 \nreceived the same doses of radiation following snowmelt. Doses of UV-BBE, UV-A 6 \nand PAR received since emergence were hence used as predictor variables, but again, 7 \nno significant correlations were recorded between radiative doses and pigment 8 \nconcentrations (data not shown). However the coefficients were all positive, 9 \nindicating an overall trend towards an increase in metabolites following melt out. 10 \nChlorophyll a \/ b ratio remained constant at 2.1 (\u00b1 0.1) in tissues under snow and in 11 \nthose that had emerged from snow (data not shown). 12 \nCarotenoid and chlorophyll concentrations in plant tissues that had recently 13 \nemerged from snow were higher than in those under a 10 cm depth of snow (Fig. 2d, 14 \ne). The concentrations of total carotenoids were 60% higher in tissues that had 15 \nemerged from snow 24 h earlier than in those under 10 cm of snow (Fig. 2d; P<0.05). 16 \nConcentrations of chlorophylls a + b in tissues that had emerged from snow 24 h 17 \npreviously were 88% higher than in those under snow (Fig. 2e; P<0.05).  18 \n 19 \nGrowth cabinet experiment 20 \nThe photosynthetic yield of C. varians recovered rapidly after transfer to the 21 \nilluminated growth cabinet (Fig. 3). During the first 45 min of the experiment, \u0424PSII 22 \nincreased from 0.52 to 0.68 (rs = 0.784, P=0.002). Over the following 9 h, \u0424PSII 23 \nremained constant at c. 0.66 (rs = 0.335, P>0.05). 24 \n 25 \n 13 \nIntra-seasonal comparison 1 \nFv\/Fm and foliar pigment concentrations differed between snowmelt and the middle of 2 \nthe growing season at Rothera Point. Fv\/Fm and the concentrations of the anthocyanin-3 \nlike pigment, UV-B screening pigments and total carotenoids were respectively 45%, 4 \n120%, 56% and 55% higher in January than in November (Fig. 4a - d). The 5 \nconcentration of chlorophyll a + b did not vary significantly between the two periods 6 \n(Fig. 4e), and neither did those of chlorophyll a or b, but the chlorophyll a \/ b ratio 7 \nwas 10% higher in January than it was in November (Fig. 4f). 8 \n 9 \nDiscussion 10 \nThe present study shows the rapid recovery of metabolic activity by hydrated plants of 11 \nthe leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians during spring snowmelt in the natural 12 \nAntarctic environment. Fv\/Fm of plants under a 10 cm depth of snow, which would 13 \nhave taken up to two weeks to melt at the rate of ablation recorded in the present 14 \nstudy, was 60% lower than that of plants which had emerged from snow. Previous 15 \nstudies have similarly reported the recovery of PSII of plants during snowmelt. For 16 \nexample, PSII activity of four lichen species studied by Pannewitz et al. (2003) at 17 \nGranite Harbour in Victoria Land, continental Antarctica, only recovered when thalli 18 \nhad almost fully ablated from snow, corroborating data on Arctic and alpine vascular 19 \nplant species (Oberbauer and Starr 2002; Hamerlynck and Smith 1994). Similarly, 20 \nSchlensog et al. (2004) found that Fv\/Fm of the mosses Bryum subrotundifolium and 21 \nHennediella heimii recovered to optimum levels four days after hydration following 22 \noverwintering in a dehydrated state at Botany Bay, also in Victoria Land. However, in 23 \ncontrast, Schlensog et al. (2004) reported that Fv\/Fm of the Antarctic lichens Physcia 24 \ncaesia and Umbilicaria aprina recovered almost completely within a few minutes of 25 \n 14 \nhydration. They suggested that the rapid recovery of PSII activity of the lichens was 1 \nowing to the reactivation of conserved photosystems, while the much slower recovery 2 \nof Fv\/Fm of the mosses indicated that repair had taken place to the photosystems. 3 \nGiven that in the current study the effective PSII yield of C. varians increased within 4 \n45 min of plants under snow being transferred to a growth cabinet, our data suggest 5 \nthat either PSII of this species is conserved over winter, or, perhaps more likely, that 6 \nrepair to the photosystems may occur before the species emerges from snow.  7 \nThe rapid recovery of PSII by C. varians during snowmelt would permit rapid 8 \ncarbon assimilation following a prolonged winter of low light levels. This 9 \ncharacteristic has similarly been suggested to be beneficial to Arctic and alpine plants 10 \nand lichens with short growing seasons (Hamerlynck and Smith 1994; Kappen et al. 11 \n1995; Oberbauer and Starr 2002). Chlorophyll concentrations similar to those 12 \nmeasured in the middle of the growing season were reached in C. varians tissues 13 \nwithin 24 h after snowmelt, further facilitating the rapid fixation of carbon after 14 \nemergence from snow. Concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids in emergent 15 \nplants were approximately twice those in plants under snow, corroborating the data of 16 \nKimball et al. (1973), who found chlorophyll concentrations in the leaves of the 17 \nmontane herbs Claytonia lanceolata and Nemophila breviflora under 10 cm of snow 18 \nto be one third of those in leaves above snow. Whether or not concentrations of 19 \nphotosynthetic pigments in the tissues of C. varians decrease with increasing depth of 20 \nsnow cover at present remains unknown. However, this is likely to occur, as 21 \nchlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations in the foliage of subnivean vascular plants 22 \nare known to be inversely associated with the depth of snow from which the plants are 23 \nsampled (Kimball et al. 1973; Oberbauer and Starr 2002). Similarly, concentrations of 24 \nUV-B photoprotective pigments, induced by exposure to low irradiances of UV 25 \n 15 \nradiation whilst plants are still beneath snow and ice, might also increase in tissues of 1 \nC. varians prior to emergence. 2 \n Photoprotective pigments, notably the anthocyanin-like pigment and UV-B 3 \nscreening pigments, have been previously shown to increase in concentration in 4 \ntissues of C. varians exposed to UV-B radiation. For example, Newsham et al. (2002) 5 \nfound that concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were associated with the dose 6 \nof solar UV-B radiation received by plants at Rothera Point over two growing 7 \nseasons. Similarly, Newsham et al. (2005) placed polyester screens over C. varians in 8 \norder to attenuate UV-B radiation, and recorded reduced concentrations of the 9 \nanthocyanin-like pigment in liverwort tissues. Subsequent removal of the screens 10 \nleads to the rapid resynthesis of the pigment (K.R.S. Snell, unpubl. data). In the 11 \npresent study we found a 10 cm depth of snow to absorb 80% of UV-B radiation dose, 12 \ncorroborating the data of Cockell et al. (2002). We hence anticipated that 13 \nconcentrations of UV-B photoprotective pigments would increase as C. varians 14 \nemerged from melting snow, in the same way that anthocyanins increase during 15 \nsnowmelt in the foliage of Arctic ericoid species (Oberbauer and Starr 2002). This 16 \nresponse was not observed. Plants under snow and those that had melted out had the 17 \nsame qN values, corroborating the observation that concentrations of the anthocyanin-18 \nlike pigment did not change, since qN is lower in tissues containing more of the 19 \npigment (K.R.S. Snell, unpubl. data). At present it is unclear why concentrations of 20 \nUV-B photoprotective pigments did not respond to changes in UV-B exposure caused 21 \nby snowmelt. We hypothesize that C. varians may prioritise pigment synthesis in 22 \nfavour of photosynthetic pigments in order to maximise carbon gain when resources 23 \nare limited during snowmelt. 24 \n 16 \n Data from the intra-seasonal comparison in the present study indicated that 1 \nconcentrations of the anthocyanin-like pigment, UV-B screening pigments and total 2 \ncarotenoids were all higher during the middle of the growing season at Rothera Point 3 \ncompared with during snowmelt. These increases in concentrations of photoprotective 4 \npigments in January, when UV-B fluxes were higher than in November owing to a 5 \nsignificantly shallower ozone column over Rothera Point, corroborate previous 6 \nstudies showing that concentrations of UV-B screening pigments, the anthocyanin-7 \nlike pigment and carotenoids increase in the tissues of C. varians exposed to UV-B 8 \nradiation (Newsham et al. 2002, 2005). We also recorded significantly higher Fv\/Fm 9 \nvalues in the middle of the growing season, indicating that although there was some 10 \nrecovery of PSII activity during snowmelt, full recovery did not occur immediately. 11 \nThese data corroborate those of Oberbauer and Starr (2002), who found Fv\/Fm of the 12 \nvascular plant species Cassiope tetragona, Ledum palustre and Vaccinium vitis-idaea 13 \nto reach optimum levels (c. 0.8) up to a month after snow had ablated. It is possible 14 \nthat the lower concentrations of UV-B photoprotective pigments in the tissues of C. 15 \nvarians during snowmelt may have predisposed plants to photoinhibition (Gould et al. 16 \n1995), accounting for the lower Fv\/Fm of plants in November. 17 \n Data from the intra-seasonal comparison also indicated that chlorophyll a \/ b 18 \nratio, which was similar to the mean of 1.97 reported by Marschall and Proctor (2004) 19 \nfor 16 liverwort species, increased between November and January. This is 20 \nattributable to more physiologically active tissues synthesizing more chlorophyll a 21 \ncompared with chlorophyll b in the middle of the growing season, or possibly to the 22 \nhigher irradiance of PAR received by plants during November, which may have 23 \ndecreased chlorophyll a \/ b ratio owing to the preferential destruction of chlorophyll a 24 \nin reaction centres (Post 1990). Despite previous evidence indicating that chlorophyll 25 \n 17 \na \/ b ratio decreases in bryophytes grown under shade conditions (Martin and 1 \nChurchill 1982), we found no change in this ratio as plants emerged from snow. Post 2 \nand Vesk (1992) similarly found no difference between the chlorophyll a \/ b ratios of 3 \nC. varians from shaded and sun-exposed habitats.  4 \nChanges to air temperatures, precipitation rates and radiative patterns arising 5 \nfrom climate change processes in Antarctic ecosystems (Convey and Smith 2006) are 6 \nlikely to present new challenges to Cephaloziella varians. These include the loss of 7 \nsnow cover and earlier melt-out times in the habitats in which C. varians occurs. 8 \nEarlier melt-out times will expose the species to additional UV-B radiation arising 9 \nfrom springtime stratospheric ozone depletion, subjecting the liverwort to additional 10 \nstress during this critical period. Early photosynthetic reactivation, in conjunction 11 \nwith the rapid synthesis of photosynthetic pigments, suggests that C. varians is well 12 \nadapted to the changing microclimatic conditions that it experiences during snowmelt. 13 \nThis suggests that, at least while its habitat remains hydrated, the species is well 14 \nplaced to cope with these additional challenges. 15 \n 16 \nAckowledgements 17 \nFunding was provided by the Natural Environment Research Council through the 18 \nBritish Antarctic Survey\u2019s Long Term Monitoring and Survey programme.
