This was\nachieved by looking at examples of different pedagogic techniques employed in several cases. The\neffectiveness of these techniques was established by looking at the students\u2019 outcomes on these\ncourses. This study has adopted a sequential mixed methodology characterized by an initial phase\nof qualitative data collection and analysis, which was followed by a phase of quantitative data collec-\ntion and analysis. The first phase of the study involved collecting a year of data from a postgraduate\nprogramme. A grounded approach was used to analyse one million words of online conferences or\ndiscussions, and led to the emergence of 29 pedagogic behaviours. These pedagogic behaviours\nwere then developed into a coding instrument. The second phase, hypothetico-deductive analysis,\nconfirmed their presence in three other cases, five million words of online interactions, and estab-\nlished their associations with students\u2019 learning and outcomes. The findings suggest seven clusters\nof pedagogies correlated with students\u2019 grades and the effect size calculation revealed an educational\nsignificance for all of them. This indicates that if they are employed in online classrooms they are\nlikely to enhance students\u2019 learning and outcomes.\nIntroduction\nDespite an increased interest in the use of e-learning to enhance students\u2019 learning, it\nis surprising that so little research has been conducted to justify these claims. Good-\nyear (2001) concluded: \u2018the literature on learning in higher education is surprisingly\nquiet with respect to what both lay people and practitioners might expect to be a key\nconstruct\u2014that of \u201cunderstanding\u201d\u2019 (p. 62). Another confirmation was put forward\nby Spector (2002), who reported: \u2018the big lesson about technology and learning from\nthe 20th century is that less is known about how people learn than many educational\nresearchers are inclined to admit\u2019 (p. xiv). It is therefore critical to find out how effec-\ntive e-learning practices are achieved.\n*Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, 17 Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1QA,\nUK. Email: wm212@cam.ac.uk\n280 W. N. Mehanna\nIn their review of 100 published research reports completed in the period 1991\u2013\n2001, Coomey and Stephenson (2001) found little if any definitive evidence of the\noverall effectiveness of \u2018e-learning\u2019 compared with more conventional methods. This\nis not to say that this medium is ineffective but rather to say that there is little\nsystematic and empirical work to show evidence of its evaluation. Laurillard (2002)\nadded that we may not have an established set of characteristic forms of effective\ne-learning; however, we could identify some effective existing learning activities and\nproduce a model that captures the good practices embedded in the activity regard-\nless of the tool utilized. As a result, if we are to unravel the various components of\neffective e-learning practice, we need to consider pedagogy. Pedagogies are\nconnected with students\u2019 learning and outcomes, and have been widely accepted for\nepistemological and empirical reasons. In this way, the issue of integrating e-learn-\ning into the pedagogical system has recently emerged as an important and pressing\nfocus for research.\nWhile much has been said about the failure of research to provide adequate\nanalytical frameworks for studying e-pedagogy, few researchers have referred to\ncertain practices that promote effective learning. Recommendations in the literature\npoint towards technologies specifically designed to provide interactivity that guides\nstudents towards online collaborations (Crook, 1994). This in turn promotes,\namong other things, skills such as articulation, justification and negotiation (Crook,\n1994), shared responsibilities (Laurillard, 1997; Goodyear, 2001), scaffolding\n(Salmon, 2000), setting hypotheses (Valdez et al., 2000), reflection (Schon, 1992;\nLaurillard, 1997; Goodyear, 2002), knowledge activation and knowledge applica-\ntion (Gagne, 1965; Bruner, 1997a,b; Goodyear, 2001), individualized learning and\nmotivation (Goodyear 2002; Garcia & Pintrich, 1991, 1993, 1995), goal setting\n(Schon, 1992; Laurillard, 1993, 1997; Goodyear, 2001; Gagne, 1977), and charac-\nteristics such as positive attitude (Mehanna, 2002, 2004), and disposition (Gagne,\n1977; Garcia & Pintrich, 1991). All these are produced while students are engaging\nin cognitive, metacognitive and other learning systems. They have also to be\ncomplemented by tutors\u2019 strategies such as feedback and reflections (Schon, 1992;\nLaurillard, 1997).\nWhile the new technologies may eventually lead us to develop a new understanding\nof effective pedagogies that are specific to these learning contexts, a good place to\nstart is to look for well-established pedagogies that extant research tells us are effective\nin other teaching and learning contexts and tie in well with students\u2019 outcomes.\nHowever, a researcher trying to collect facts about what research has found about\npedagogy is faced with a daunting task. For example, as cited in Marzano (1998),\nHattie et al. (1996) identified over 21,000 studies that one would have to consult for\na comprehensive literature review on the factors that affect students\u2019 outcomes and\nachievement in education. Looking for effective pedagogies in the meta-analyses\nresearch or \u2018evidenced-based research\u2019 that guided educational interventions seems a\nsensible starting point.\nFollowing an extensive and systematic search of databases, Marzano\u2019s (1998) \u2018A\ntheory-based meta-analysis of research on instructions\u2019 was identified as the most\nThe pedagogies of e-learning 281\nsophisticated and appropriate. It posited the interaction of four aspects or systems of\nhuman thought operating in most, if not all situations: \n\u25cf The self-system processing of presenting tasks. This system contains a network of inter-\nrelated beliefs that enable one to make sense of the world (Markus & Ruvulo,\n1990) and processes that evaluate the importance of the presenting task relative to\na system of goals and assesses the probability of success relative to the individual\u2019s\nbeliefs. (Harter, 1980; Garcia & Pintrich, 1991, 1993; Garcia, 1995). If the\npresenting task is judged as important and the rate of success is high, positive affect\nis generated and the individual is motivated to engage in the presenting task.\n\u25cf The use of task-related knowledge. This system is comprised of the information,\nmental processes, and psychomotor processes that are specific to a subject matter\n(Ajzen, 1985; Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977, 1980; Ajzen & Madden, 1986).\n\u25cf The cognitive processing of tasks is responsible for the effective processing of the\ninformation essential to the presenting task (Anderson, 1995). This system acts on\nan individual knowledge base (Lindsay & Norman, 1977) and can be organized in\nfour categories: storage and retrieval, information processing, input\/output, and\nknowledge utilization (Marzano, 1998)\n\u25cf The meta-cognitive processing of tasks controls any and all aspects of the knowledge\nand the cognitive system (Sternberg, 1977, 1979, 1984, 1986, 1986a, 1986b;\nSchank & Abeleson, 1977). To this extent, this system has been described as\nresponsible for the \u2018executive control of all processes\u2019 (Flavell, 1979, 1987; Brown,\n1978, 1987). In other words, it is the \u2018engine for learning\u2019 (Marzano, 1998).\nFigure 1 summarizes Marzano\u2019s (2001) learning systems and their connections\nFigure 1. The four systems of learning and their connectionsFrom these four systems, Marzano (2001) teased out nine specific pedagogies that\nwere further researched in a separate meta-analysis (Marzano, 2000). Based on their\neffect sizes (ES) Marzano recommended their use by all teachers in all subject areas.\nThey are: \n\u25cf Identifying similarities and differences between items (ES = 1.61).\n\u25cf Summarizing and note taking which involves at least two highly related elements:\nfilling missing parts and translation of information into a synthesized form (ES =\n1.00).\n\u25cf Recognizing effort and providing recognition are strategies that deal with students\u2019\nattitudes and beliefs and thus, are likely to affect students\u2019 level of engagement in\ncognitive processes (ES = 0.80).\n\u25cf Homework and practice provide students with opportunities to deepen their\nunderstanding and proficiency in any content area (ES = 0.77).\n\u25cf Nonlinguistic representations involve the use of graphs, charts, maps, mind maps\n(ES = 0.75).\n\u25cf Cooperative learning comprises five elements: positive interdependence, face-to-\nface promotive interaction, individual and group accountability, interpersonal and\nsmall group skills, and group processing (ES = 0.73).\n\u25cf Generating and testing hypotheses involve the application of knowledge (ES =\n0.61). For example, a student watches a demonstration on how air flows over the\n282 W. N. Mehanna\nwing of a plane. Later, he applies this in hypothesizing that the changing shape of\nwings in a specific way will have a specific effect on the flow of air, designs a wing\nwith desire shape and test his conjecture (Marzano, 1998).\n\u25cf Setting objectives and providing feedback are activities that many researchers and\ntheorists refer to as the meta-cognitive system of thinking. Both strategies were\nfound to greatly enhance (ES = 0.61).\n\u25cf Activating Prior Knowledge. The tutor can help students use their background\nknowledge to learn new information is to present them with advance organizers\nsuch as questions and cues (ES = 0.59).\nThe two meta-analyses provided us with evidence-based research that highlighted\nspecific pedagogies and their association and impact on students\u2019 learning. It seems\nreasonably obvious that e-learning makes use of techniques that have been used\neffectively in face-to-face learning. However, this study wants the grounded analysis\nto reveal, in the first instance, the kind of strategies embedded in the online discus-\nsions.\nMortimore (1999) refers to pedagogy as a \u2018contested\u2019 term with \u2018changing conno-\ntations and pressures\u2019. His preferred definition states that pedagogy is: \u2018any conscious\naction by one person designed to enhance learning in another\u2019 (p. 3).\nFigure 1. The four systems of learning and their connections\nThe pedagogies of e-learning 283\nFor the purpose of this study, pedagogy is any effective behaviour or activities\ndesigned to impart knowledge, it is used in the process of teaching and learning, and\nhas an association with students\u2019 learning and outcomes. Of particular interest to\nmany e-learning researchers have been those pedagogies associated with social inter-\nactions and online discussions (Henri, 1997; Stephenson, 2002; Alexander & Boud,\n2001). Online discussions are facilitated by Computer Conferencing, a web-based\ncommunication system that supports asynchronous, textual interaction between two\nor more persons. Online discussions combine input from tutors and students, and\nprovide opportunities to examine their online interactions, which have been facili-\ntated by the technology. Consequently, a great emphasis was placed on the written\ncommunications as they might reveal evidence of students\u2019 participation, contribu-\ntion, communication and work that shows knowledge application, and criticality\namong other indicators of meaningful and effective learning. Moreover, tutors\u2019\ninput could be monitored for facilitation, feedback and other evidence of effective\nteaching.\nStudies that have analysed the content of the online discussions were also limited.\nThis is due to the time required to perform such analyses (Hara et al., 2000) and\nresearchers still lack a reliable instrument or an analytical framework to analyse the\nonline discussions. Goodyear (2001) noted: \u2018Analyzing the content of networked\nlearning discussions is a troublesome research area and several commentators have\nremarked on the difficulty of connecting online texts to discourse to learning\u2019 (p. 62).\nMethodology\nA mixed-modal methodology was adopted using both quantitative and qualitative\ntechniques. Using this approach not only helps answer certain research questions but\nalso facilitates the triangulation within and between stages. Creswell\u2019s (2003) model\nof sequential exploratory procedures fit the purposes of this study. It is characterized\nby an initial phase of qualitative data collection and analysis, which is followed by a\nphase of quantitative data collection and analysis. \u2018Collective case studies\u2019 (Stake,\n2000) were adopted to investigate several cases which are chosen because it is\nbelieved that understanding the collection will lead to understanding and better theo-\nrizing of a still larger collection of cases. Four postgraduate programmes in four differ-\nent UK universities were purposively chosen. 200 students and 14 tutors took part in\nthis study.\nThe processes of coding and analysis were iterative and started by sorting all online\ninteractions according to individuals\u2019 postings. Each student and each tutor had a file.\nThis data was then converted from HTML into text files in order to load it in NViVo.\nThe first stage of the study adopted a grounded approach. When the data was satu-\nrated, the end of phase one of the study had been reached, and stage two began with\nthe development of the code schedule. The content analysis of stage two acted as a\nwider theoretical sample, for all the categories were re-visited in an attempt to discon-\nfirm or qualify the findings. The researcher went over the transcript sentence by\nsentence and coded according to the existing twenty-nine categories. Once the coding\n284 W. N. Mehanna\nwas done, a summary sheet was completed for each student and tutor that included\nthe occurrences or frequencies for each one of the pedagogies. Three inter-raters reli-\nability checks were done and their average showed 95.7% agreements. The frequen-\ncies of these pedagogies along with students\u2019 grades were entered in SPSS for\nstatistical compilations. To unify the measure, all frequencies were rescaled into\npercentages which facilitated the comparisons between students within the same\ngroup and across groups.\nFor triangulation, online questionnaires and interviews were administered to solicit\nstudents\u2019 and tutors\u2019 accounts with regard to the use of these 29 pedagogic behaviours\nand their occurrences in the online interactions.\nFindings\nThe first stage of the research consisted of collection of a year of data from a post-\ngraduate programme. A grounded approach was used to analyse one million words\nof online discussions. Twenty-nine strategies and pedagogic behaviours emerged\nfrom students\u2013students and students\u2013tutors interactions. They were categorized into\nthree main groups to form the coding schedule: five common strategies for both\nstudents and tutors, thirteen strategies specific to tutors and eleven for students.\nThe code schedule was then implemented to test the presence of these pedagogic\nbehaviours in three other cases and five million words of online interactions. The text\nof the online discussions was read sentence by sentence, and coded according to the\ncoding schedule. As a result, the 29 pedagogic behaviours that have emerged from\nstage one were re-visited, re-interrogated, and re-confirmed in this stage. All catego-\nries were present and no new ones have emerged.\nStrauss and Corbin (1998) noted that \u2018axial coding\u2019 may be used to relate catego-\nries and to continue to develop them in terms of their properties and dimensions until\nfinal classifications are reached and we could label the phenomena accordingly. An\nattempt was therefore made to group the 29 pedagogic behaviours into nine clusters\nthat were theoretically and conceptually tied. The new clusters revealed striking\ncompatibility with Marzano\u2019s nine and the 29 categories that emerged from this study\nprovided detailed explanations for each cluster in the form of more specific strategies\nthat could be embedded under each one of Marzano\u2019s. In addition to the triangula-\ntion achieved in this way, this clustering provided an opportunity to test Marzano\u2019s\nschool-based theory in the context of on-line higher education. Table 1 shows the\npedagogies, the clusters and their theoretical backing.\nSeven clusters correlated with students\u2019 grades: \n\u25cf Summarizing and note taking (with a correlation of r (df = 138) = .287**, p <\n0.001).\n\u25cf Reinforcing Effort and Providing Recognition (with a correlation of r (df = 138) =\n.181**, p < 0.02).\n\u25cf Homework and practice (with a correlation of r (df = 138) = .487**, p < 0.001).\n\u25cf Non-Linguistic Presentation (with a correlation of r (df = 138) = .151**, p < 0.05).\nThe pedagogies of e-learning 285\nTable 1.

The total context of the study was taken into\nconsideration, especially the measures that were used and the scores generated.\nFollowing Cohen\u2019s interpretation of ES into percentile standing, the following\ncould be expected as percentile gain from the calculated ES. In other words, the\ngroup of students that uses these clusters are likely to have better standing than those\nstudents who do not use them (Table 3).\nThe evidence suggests that these clusters are likely to increase students\u2019 grades and\nit was therefore of interest to analyze the relationship among these clusters and detect\nif there were any gender difference. School-based gender studies show the boys trail\nbehind girls with their homework and school responsibilities (Sommers, 2000). Sukh-\nnandan et al. (2000) even proposed rationales and recommendations to adopt certain\nTable 2.

Due to the fact\nthat the number of male enrolled in these programmes has drastically surpassed the\nfemale, non-parametric tests were conducted (Table 4).\nThe three tests Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and Wald-Wolfowitz showed no signifi-\ncant difference. Therefore, we could firmly conclude that the use of these specific\nclusters of pedagogies within our context is gender-neutral (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Gender comparisonThe same was applicable for the two remaining clusters and no difference was\nfound (Figure 3). Therefore the use of e-learning pedagogies within our context\nappears to be gender-neutral.\nFigure 3. Comparison across genders\nTable 4.

Gender comparison\nThe pedagogies of e-learning 289\nValidation of the effect size calculations\nRoyer (2000) warned: \u2018It is important to note that measures of effect sizes do not\ndirectly translate into indications of practical importance\u2019 (p. 239). This warning\nreinforces earlier work by Glass et al. (1981) where they specified that it was not\nenough to associate the effect-size metric with descriptive adjectives such as \u2018small,\nmoderate and large\u2019. Therefore, determining the significance of a particular effect size\nrequires interpreting what the size of the effect really means. While recent recommen-\ndations (Wainer & Robinson, 2003) were made for the Null Hypothesis (NH) to\nsupport the calculation of the effect size and determining its practical importance, it\nwas found that this is not applicable in all cases and several criticisms were apparent\ndue to the misuse and misinterpretation of the NS (Cohen, 1990, 1994; Rosenthal,\n1991; Thompson, 1994). An alternative for interpreting the value of ES or its educa-\ntional significance is \u2018to think meta-analytically\u2019 (Thompson, 2002). Thompson\nprefers a model where effect sizes from individual studies are interpreted in the\ncontext of previous studies, let alone a meta-analysis in our case. This was an addi-\ntional incentive behind the regrouping of the 29 pedagogic behaviours into Marzano\u2019s\noriginal 9. The mean and the median indicated non-symmetry in both sets of data,\nMarzano\u2019s and Mehanna\u2019s (ES); therefore, the sign test, a binomial test, was found\nto be the most suitable to seek further comparisons and interpretations (Table 5).\nNo significant difference was observed. This indicates that the average effect size\nproduced by the different clusters of pedagogies of this study generated almost the\nsame statistical effect reported in Marzano\u2019s meta-analysis.\nFigure 3. Comparison across genders\n290 W. N. Mehanna\nConclusion and implications\nThis mixed methods multi-case study research has purposely focused on the peda-\ngogic aspect of e-learning in higher education. Findings suggest a number of pedago-\ngies that are worthy of including in the online teaching and learning processes due to\ntheir theoretical backing and the empirical evidence of their correlations with\nstudents\u2019 learning and outcomes. These emerging nine clusters of pedagogies repre-\nsent a composite system made of 29 effective practices belonging to four learning\nsystems. These findings provided empirical evidence that \u2018blending\u2019 different learning\ntheories and pedagogies was not only possible but beneficial, and satisfied Oliver\u2019s\n(2004) call to justify the use of \u2018blended pedagogies\u2019.\nThe pedagogically driven approach to e-learning allows practitioners to make the\nlink between pedagogy and different learning systems (Conole et al., 2004). This in\nturn provides empirical evidence that confirms Minocha and Sharp (2004) proposition\nwhich denotes that \u2018e-learning in higher education should adopt pedagogical models\nthat are not fundamentalist in nature but allow for a complementarity between behav-\niourism and constructivism\u2019 (p. 2) and cognitivism (Driscoll, 2002). \u2018One reason for\nthe lack of application of models and theories by e-learning practitioners may be that,\nas academics outside the field of education, they find the diverse array of theoretical\nperspectives alien and overwhelming\u2019 (Conole et. al, 2004, p. 18; McNaught, 2003).\nAdopting the effective pedagogies presented in this study seems a first step towards\npreparing e-pedagogues. An e-pedagogue is a teacher at heart, has a passion for learn-\ning, knowledge of learning theories and effective pedagogy, and understands the func-\ntionality of e-learning technology.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to thank John Siraj-Blatchford for the personal interest he showed,\nthe enthusiasm with which he supervised the PhD work, and for his insightful profes-\nsional guidance.
