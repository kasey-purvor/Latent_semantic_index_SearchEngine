A simple method\nis described for the initial design of a helix slow-wave structure of\nthis kind to achieve high overall efficiency.

The technique is illustrated by its application to a 70\nW Ku-band TWT and the performance is shown to be comparable\nwith that of an existing TWT.\nIndex Terms\u2014Design, helix, traveling-wave tube.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHE HELIX traveling-wave tubes employed as the finalpower amplifiers in space systems such as satellite com-\nmunications and direct broadcasting must deliver power output\nin the range 50 to 200 W with the best possible conversion ef-\nficiency, linearity and reliability. Good conversion efficiency is\nimportant because of the limited power available on the satellite\nand because of the difficulty of dissipating heat in space. High\nlinearity is required so that the tube can be operated as close to\nits saturated output power as possible. The achievement of high\nlinearity will be of particular importance to the development of\nbroadband multicarrier systems in future. In order to achieve\nthese requirements, tubes for space applications are commonly\nconstructed with a helix pitch profile comprising [1], [2],\n1) an input section to establish the growing wave;\n2) a section with increased phase velocity to gather the elec-\ntrons into bunches as effectively as possible;\n3) a section with reduced phase velocity to extract the energy\nfrom the bunched beam as effectively as possible.\nThis pitch profile increases the efficiency of the TWT in two\nways:\ni) by increasing the proportion of electrons which are in the\nretarding phase of the field of the helix in the output sec-\ntion of the tube;\nii) by reducing the proportion of electrons which are accel-\nerated in the output section of the tube so that the propor-\ntion of the spent beam energy which can be recovered by\na multi-element depressed collector is increased.\nManuscript received May 9, 2000; revised August 14, 2000.

Helix pitch profile used to determine (a) z and (b) z .\nThe saturated efficiencies of space TWTs which use this ap-\nproach exceed 65% at Ku-band and below [3], [4]. This tech-\nnique should be distinguished from the use of a section of helix\nwith increased phase velocity to suppress backward wave oscil-\nlations [5] although it is likely that it would also have that effect.\nIn general the introduction of a taper leads to a reduction in the\nlinearity of a tube, but it has been found that the addition of\na section of helix with increased phase velocity can counteract\nthis effect. Although helix slow-wave circuits designed in this\nway have been in use for at least ten years no general procedure\nfor their design has been published. The purpose of this paper\nis to present a general procedure for achieving the initial design\nof a high efficiency TWT which is close to optimum.\nII. DESIGN PROCEDURE\nThe work described in this paper was carried out using the\nfollowing two software packages developed at CEERI.\ni) HELTAPE [6] computes the electrical properties of a\nhelix slow-wave structure from its dimensions, and\n0018\u20139383\/00$10.00 \u00a9 2000 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Using these packages the design procedure\nwas carried out in a number of steps, as follows.\n1) The input electron beam power was determined from the\noutputpowerrequiredandanestimateoftheelectroniceffi-\nciencyofthetube.Thiswasconvertedinto thebeamvoltage\nand current by choosing the perveance of the electron gun.\nThe rf input power was determined from the specified sat-\nurated output power and gain. This input power was kept\nfixed throughout the remainder of the design process.\n2) Themeanhelixradius( )waschosensothat 1where\nis the signal frequency in radians\/sec. at\nthe band center and is the initial velocity of the electron\nbeam.Thetapewidthandthickness,theshielddiameterand\nthe material and dimensions of the helix support rods were\nalso chosen in the conventional manner.\n3) SUNRAY 1-D was used to determine three values of the\naxial propagation constant of the helix at the center fre-\nquency of a tube having a single section of helix with uni-\nform phase velocity corresponding to [9]:\ni) Maximum small-signal gain ( );\nii) Maximum beam bunching ( );\niii) Maximum electronic efficiency ( ).\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 2. (a) Variation of fundamental and harmonic output power with z , and\n(b) Pitch profile for circuit 1.\nHELTAPE was then used to determine the helix pitch cor-\nresponding toeachof theseconditions: for for\nand for . It has not been proved that these\nare the optimal pitches in a multipitch design but the results\nwhich have been obtained using this design method are not\nfar from those achieved in optimized TWTs.\n4) Checks were carried outusing SUNRAY 1-Dto ensure that\neffective beam bunching was achieved at the bottom of the\nintended frequency band of the tube when the helix pitch is\n. Similar checks were carried out to ensure that sufficient\nefficiency was achieved at the top of the frequency band\nwhen the helix pitch was . Some adjustments to and\ncould be carried out at this stage if necessary.\n5) The cold loss of the helix was taken to be of the order of\n20 dB\/m. It was found that the circuit could conveniently\nbe severed between the input section of pitch and the\nsection with pitch . The attenuators on each side of the\nsever were taken to be two or three wavelengths long with\nlinearly increasingattenuationandaone-waylossof60dB.\n6) Using the arrangement shown inFig. 1(a) an initial value of\nwaschosentogiveagainofat least20dBinthe inputsec-\ntion to ensure that the growing wave was fully established.\nThe length was then adjusted to obtain the maximum\nbeambunching( ) in thesectionof thecircuithavingpitch\n, and arbitrary length, for the given input power.

The maximum permissible\ngain depends on the properties of the helix and the electron\nbeam and on the reflection coefficients of the attenuators\nand the input and output connections.\n7) Using the arrangement showninFig. 1(b) the length was\nadjusted togivemaximumforwardcircuitpower in thesec-\ntion of the circuit with pitch and arbitrary length.

EFFECT OF A REGION WITH INCREASED PHASE VELOCITY\nThe benefits of introducing a section of helix with increased\nphase velocity are shown by two simple examples based on a\nC-Band TWT whose specification and basic data are given in\nTables I and II, respectively.\nFirst a tube was simulated with an input section having pitch\nfollowed by an output section with pitch as shown in\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4. (a) Variation of fundamental and harmonic output power with z , and\n(b) Optimum pitch profile for circuit 2.\nFig. 2(b). The output section was taken to be of arbitrary length\nand no severs, tapers or terminal mismatches were included in\nthe model. This circuit is referred to as circuit 1. The length\nof the input section ( ) was varied with constant drive power\nand the maximum forward power in the output section deter-\nmined. Fig. 2(a) shows that the saturated output power and the\nharmonic power at saturation varied only slowly with . For the\npurposes of illustration was chosen to be 65 mm, as shown\nin Fig. 2(b). This value produces slightly less than the max-\nimum output power but ensures that the gain of the output sec-\ntion is small enough to ensure that the tube will be stable. The\nlength of the output section was chosen so that the forward wave\nreached saturation at its end. Fig. 3 shows the transfer char-\nacteristics of this tube including the harmonic power and the\ntwo-tone third-order intermodulation product power. The latter\nwas computed from the single carrier transfer characteristics\nusing IMAL2 [10].\nThe second tube (circuit 2) had a section of helix having pitch\nas shown in Fig. 4(b). Initially, this tube was simulated with a\nsecond section of arbitrary length and was adjusted to achieve\nthe highest value of fundamental beam current in the second\nsection. Then a negative step to pitch was added and the\nlength ( ) of the second section adjusted to obtain the max-\nimum forward power in the output section. Fig. 4(a) shows how\nthe output power and the harmonic power for circuit 2 varied\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:18 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nSRIVASTAVA et al.: HELIX SLOW-WAVE STRUCTURES 2441\nFig. 5. Transfer characteristics for circuit 2.\nwith . It is seen that the output power is increased and the har-\nmonic output decreased by the addition of the section having\nincreased pitch. The marked decrease in the harmonic power\nas is increased is presumably caused by the control which\nthis section of the tube exercises over the bunching process and\nthis effect deserves further study. Finally, was chosen so that\nthe forward power reached saturation at the tube output. The\ndimensions of this circuit are shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 5 shows\nthe transfer characteristics for circuit 2. Compared with circuit\n1 it is seen that, at saturation, the output power is increased and\nthe harmonic power is decreased. There is a slight deterioration\nin the intermodulation distortion which is probably caused by\nthe increase in the phase delay at low drive levels. The satu-\nrated output power could be increased still further by the use of\na more complex output taper [11] but we have found, in a sepa-\nrate study, that a wide range of tapering strategies all produced\nan improvement of around 2 to 3 dB though with variations in\nthe shapes of the transfer curves.\nIV. EXAMPLE\nThe method described above was used to design a Ku-band\nTWT whose specification is typical of satellite communications\ntubes. The specification is shown in Table I and the basic design\nparameters in Table II.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe procedure proposed for designing a helix slow-wave\nstructure with positively and negatively tapered sections is\nsimple to carry out. The results computed compare well with\nfigures reported elsewhere for state-of-the-art TWTs. It is con-\ncluded that this method provides an excellent way of achieving\nan initial design which is close to optimum and which can then\nbe improved still further by design iterations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. B.
