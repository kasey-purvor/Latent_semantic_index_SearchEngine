Educa-\ntional disadvantage can start at an early age and is determined by family and\nschool inputs as well as racial factors (Todd and Wolpin 2004).\nIn this paper we examine the educational performance of indigenous Aus-\ntralians compared to that of non-indigenous Australians. Speci\u0085cally, we inves-\ntigate the magnitude of educational disadvantage amongst indigenous groups\nand show how this becomes progressively worse as these student groups get\nolder. To do this we focus on test score performance in both literacy and nu-\nmeracy of Queensland students in senior primary school at ages 10 and 12.\nEvidence from the US documents how gaps develop between racial minorities\nand the majority group, in some instances widening as the length of time in the\nschool system increases (Carneiro et al 2003, ?). However, there is very little\ncomparable evidence for indigenous minority groups.\nThe population of indigenous minority groups tend to be highly spatially\nconcentrated, often residing in remote communities or concentrated in particular\nurban areas. This is particularly true of indigenous Australians. Approximately\n2\nhalf of the working indigenous population live in rural or remote areas (Borland\nand Hunter 2000), while urban indigenous Australians are often concentrated\nin lower income residential areas (Hunter 1996). This spatial segregation poses\nparticular problems in terms of education policy, as indigenous Australians are\noften schooled in circumstances that di\u00a4er markedly from other Australians\n(ABS 1995). Furthermore, for many indigenous children, and especially those\nin rural and remote areas, English will be a second language (ESL) which may\nfurther compound the disadvantage associated with attending relatively poor\nschools.\nThis study is novel in a number of ways. It represents the \u0085rst econometric\nstudy comparing indigenous and non-indigenous educational di\u00a4erentials for\nprimary age pupils. This is examined by contrasting indigenous educational\nperformance to that of non-indigenous Australians from an English Speaking\nBackground (ESB) and those from a non-English Background (NESB). We also\ndistinguish between Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, who\nhave di\u00a4erent ethnic backgrounds, customs and languages. The two groups\ntypically have been treated as a single group in previous research, which as we\nshall show is incorrect.1 Lastly, this study provides an analysis of the correlation\nbetween geographical remoteness and indigenous educational attainment.2 As\nsuch we provide insights that may be generalised to other indigenous minority\npopulations, such as those in the US and Canada.\n1A notable exception is Biddle et al (2004) which includes an examination of di\u00a4erences in\nsecondary educational participation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.\n2Kuhn and Sweetman (2002) argue, however, that the e\u00a4ect of geographical remoteness on\nindigenous outcomes may re\u0087ect cultural rather than spatial factors.\n3\nWe \u0085nd that, even at the age of 10 years, indigenous students perform\nmarkedly worse on numeracy and literacy tests when compared to non-indigenous\nstudents. At this stage indigenous students are already approximately 1 year be-\nhind on literacy and numeracy performance when compared to national bench-\nmark standards. This disparity is even more marked for rural and remote in-\ndigenous students, who are on average approximately 2 years behind the literacy\nand numeracy skills of ESB children in similar geographic areas by age 12. Fur-\nthermore, these di\u00a4erences between ESB and indigenous groups, in most cases,\nwiden between the ages of 10 (year 5) and 12 (year 7). We also show that in-\ndigenous students in rural areas for whom English is a second language perform\nparticularly poorly, especially in the case of girls. Only a small proportion of the\nindigenous to ESB education performance gap appears to be due to observable\ncontemporaneous personal, school and spatial characteristics. A large part of\nthe disadvantage is attributable to prior attainment e\u00a4ects, which capture prior\nfamily and school e\u00a4ects, as well as endowed individual mental ability.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section II provides\nbackground on the state of Queensland and its indigenous population along with\nan overview of the data source. Section III sets out the empirical methodology,\nwhich is followed in section IV by a discussion of our results. Section V concludes\nwith a brief discussion of the implications for policy.\n4\n2 Background and Data\n2.1 Background\nQueensland is the third most populous state in Australia with a population of\n3.7 million according to the 2001 census. It covers approximately 1.7 million\nsquare kilometres, but roughly 66% of the population live in the area of south\neast Queensland centred around the state capital of Brisbane (ABS 2002a).\nAccording to the 2001 census, there were approximately 112,000 indigenous\npeople living in Queensland, 27% of the total indigenous Australian population\n(ABS 2002b). The indigenous population is highly spatially concentrated, es-\npecially in the remote parts of the state. For instance, while only 1.5% of the\npopulation of the Brisbane area is indigenous, 23.5% of the Mount Isa region\n(in the far west of the state) is indigenous and in some areas of far northern\nQueensland and the Torres Strait Islands, the populations are up to 90% in-\ndigenous.\nTwo distinct indigenous populations reside in Queensland, Aborigines and\nTorres Strait Islanders. Aborigines are the predominate group.3 Whilst Abo-\nrigines are indigenous to mainland Australia, Torres Strait Islanders originate\nfrom islands in the stretch of water between the north of mainland Australia\nand Papua New Guinea (the Torres Strait). However, a large proportion of the\nTorres Strait Islander population now resides on the mainland. Both groups\nhave native languages other than English, but the extent to which these are\n387,322 Aborigines resided in Queensland in 2001, compared to 16,415 Torres Strait\nIslanders.\n5\nthe main language di\u00a4ers by location. For instance, whilst 81% of Torres Strait\nIslanders who still reside on the islands report an indigenous language or Creole\nas their main language, 70% of those residing on the mainland speak English as\ntheir main language (ABS 1997).\nAs at 2001, only 29.8% of indigenous males and 26.0% of indigenous fe-\nmales possessed post-school quali\u0085cations compared to 50.1% and 39.5%, re-\nspectively, for the non-indigenous population (Hunter and Schwab 2003). In-\ndigenous students are substantially more likely to be suspended or expelled from\nschool (Commonwealth 1997), and lose on average two to four years of schooling\nthrough absenteeism. The equivalent \u0085gure for non-indigenous groups is about\none half of the indigenous level (Groome and Hamilton 1995).\n2.2 Data\nThis study uses four di\u00a4erent data sources. The main data source refers to year\n5 (age approximately 10 years) and year 7 (age approximately 12 years) records\nof the population of students in government-funded schools in Queensland in\n2001 supplied by the Education Department of the Queensland State Govern-\nment (hereafter Education Queensland). The second data source is drawn from\nteacher personnel data (based on Education Queensland\u0092s human resource in-\nformation system) for the year 2001. This includes data on the average experi-\nence of teachers employed at the school along with the total number of teacher\nhours per week for the school. Additionally, we can control for the size of the\nschool, which previous research has suggested creates scale economies in ed-\n6\nucation production (Bradley and Taylor 1998). These data also enable us to\nidentify whether the school is in a rural, remote or urban area. The inclusion\nof student\u0092s residential postcode in the primary data enables us to link this to\n1996 Census data, which contains average adult income within each postcode\ndistrict. 4 Similarly, unemployment rates for local government areas (LGAs)\nare linked to the student via the postcode, these were obtained from the Federal\nDepartment of Employment and Workplace Relations.\nThe two variables of particular interest in this study are the pupil\u0092s numeracy\nand literacy scores The test scores are scaled to a national average of 600 for\nyear 5 and 700 for year 7. Hence, the average student will progress 100 points\nin test score attainment over 2 years of schooling. We focus our discussion on\nthese absolute scaled test scores as a measure of student achievement because\nthey best capture the change in educational performance as students get older\n(Todd and Wolpin 2004). However, we also report z-score results to provide\nsome illustration of the magnitude of relative indigenous performance.\nOur sample consists of all Queensland primary school students who were\nin year 7 in 2001 and for whom we also observe a year 5 test score in 1999.\nThe data set initially consists of 37,390 students, however 11,428 students are\nlost through attrition between year 5 and year 7, which we discuss below. De-\nscriptive statistics for the sample of year 7 pupils split according to gender and\n4Note, however, that variations in income between geographic areas (measured here at a\npostcode level) are less than within area variations in income (Hunter and Gregory 1996).\nNote also that non-indigenous groups may locate in remote areas in search of well paid jobs\nin the mining industries, whereas the location decisions of indigenous groups are associated\nwith their historical ties to the areas.\n7\nindigenous group status are presented in Appendix Table A1. English is the\nsecond language spoken for a large proportion of NESB students, as well as\nfor over a \u0085fth of Torres Strait Islander students, but only 7% of Aboriginal\nstudents. Indigenous students are much more likely to attend remote schools.\nINSERT TABLE 1\nRestricting our sample to the set of students with both year 5 and year\n7 test scores has the potential to introduce bias in our statistical analysis,\nsince attrition may be non-ignorable because of the non-random nature of the\nprocess. There is attrition in our sample, one of the reasons is non-attendance.\nThis is particularly an issue for indigenous Australians who increasingly ab-\nsent themselves throughout the period of compulsory schooling (Groome and\nHamilton 1995). To investigate the possible impact of attrition on our results\nTable 1 presents test scores for students for whom we have year 5 test results\nbut no matching year 7 test score and for comparison the table also includes\ntest scores on our matched sample. For both ESB and NESB students, year 5\ntest scores are only marginally lower amongst attriters when compared to our\nmatched sample, which implies that the year 5 test results for these groups\nfor the matched sample should not be severely biased. However, for both in-\ndigenous groups test scores in the attrited sample are substantially (up to 40\npoints) lower than in the matched sample, which must mean that on average it\nis less able indigenous students who attrit.5 Further investigation of the higher\nmoments of the test score distribution for those who attrited revealed that they\n5Although this average e\u00a4ect might mask variations by reason of attrition, which we do\nnot observe.\n8\nwere close to normally distributed. Overall, the \u0085ndings in Table 1 suggest that\nanalysis based on students for whom we observe both year 5 and year 7 test\nscores will provide a lower bound estimate of the indigenous to non-indigenous\ndi\u00a4erence in educational achievement.\nINSERT TABLE 2\nThe upper panel of Table 2 presents average test scores and associated stan-\ndard deviations (in parentheses) by gender and ethnicity at both year 5 and\nyear 7. For all ethnic groups, girls outperform boys in literacy. Conversely,\nboys\u0092numeracy performance is generally better than girls, although this dif-\nference is not as marked as that for literacy. ESB students outperform NESB\nstudents by approximately 15 to 16 points at year 5, and 14 to 18 points at year\n7. Both groups of indigenous students underperform markedly when compared\nto the national benchmarks, and only just perform above the year 5 benchmark\nfor numeracy at year 7, although Torres Strait Islanders do slightly better than\nAboriginals. At year 5 indigenous students already achieve between 54 and 65\npoints lower average test scores than comparable ESB students. Generally, for\nboth indigenous groups this gap widens between year 5 and year 7. Aborginal\nboys appear to perform worse than Torres Strait Islander boys at both literacy\nand numeracy.\nThe lower panel of Table 2 extends the analysis further by presenting average\ntest score attainment strati\u0085ed by whether the student was attending an urban\nschool or a rural\/remote school. What is striking about the \u0085ndings is that for\nESB students there are only minor di\u00a4erences in average test scores between\n9\nstudents from urban and rural\/remote schools, becoming more pronounced for\nNESB students, and very marked for indigenous students. For instance, indige-\nnous students in rural\/remote schools score between 10 and 31 points less than\ntheir urban counterparts, which means that rural\/remote indigenous students\nvastly underperform in comparison to rural\/remote ESB students. At year 7\nthis di\u00a4erential ranges from 50 points for male Torres Strait Islanders in literacy\nto as much as 93 points for Aboriginal females in numeracy.\nIn sum, the substantial di\u00a4erences in the performance of indigenous students\nin rural\/remote areas when compared with their ESB counterparts suggests an\nachievement gap of almost 2 whole years of schooling, an alarming di\u00a4erence.\n3 Empirical Methodology\nOur modelling is based on the familiar educational production function (Hanushek\n1992), and draws heavily on the notation and discussion in Todd and Wolpin\n(2003). They rightly describe a child\u0092s educational development as a cumulative\nprocess, in\u0087uenced by the history of family and school inputs as well as inherited\nendowments, which can be described as a \u0091true\u0092education production function\ntechnology. This section describes the models that we are able to estimate with\nour data, and also highlights the limitations of these models.\nThe test scores (T ) achieved by individual i in household j at age a is given\nby Equation (1) (i.e. Equation (3) from Todd and Wolpin, 2003):\nTija = f(Fij(a); Sij(a); \u0016ij0; \"ija) (1)\n10\nwhere Fij(a) and Sij(a) are vectors of all relevant family and school vari-\nables, re\u0087ecting the input decisions of both sets of agents into the educational\ndevelopment of the child. Note that these inputs vary with age a. The two\nremaining terms refer to endowed mental capacity at conception (\u0016ij0) and an\nerror term (\"ija). The main problem in attempting to estimate the regression\nanalogue of equation (1) is that \u0016ij0 is not observable (but is sometimes prox-\nied by parental education). Our \u0085rst model is the so-called \u0091contemporaneous\nspeci\u0085cation\u0092, referred to as Model I, given by Equation 2:\nTij12 = \f0+\f1ETHij +\f2INCOMEik12+\f3Uik12+\f4Sij12+\f5Gij12+ \"ij12\n(2)\nOur particular interest is the di\u00a4erences in the test score performance of\nindigenous and non-indigeneous groups, we specify a variable ETHij , which\nis the ethnicity of the child and is obviously \u0085xed over time. It is expected\nthat \f1NESB ; \f1Aborigine; \f1Torres < 0; and also that \f1Aborigine; \f1Torres <\n\f1NESB : Whilst our data contain several important school level covariates, it\nis relatively poor with respect to family inputs. We do, however, have the\npostcode of the household, and therefore map the average income, INCOME,\nfor adults in each geographical area, k, to each student. This is crude, but we\nexpect that, after controlling for location, families in postcode areas with higher\nincomes are able to provide more complementary inputs to the education of their\nchild than are families in low income areas. Using a similar mapping process\nwe also include the local area unemployment rates (U). We capture the e\u00a4ect\n11\nof geographic segregation by including two variables that indicate whether the\nschool is located in a rural area or in a remote area (Gij12). Finally, \"\n0\nij12\nis an additive error term. In such a speci\u0085cation the error term includes all\nthe omitted factors; the history of past inputs, endowed mental ability and\nmeasurement error (Todd and Wolpin 2003).\nThis formulation of the production function, whilst standard in the litera-\nture, has been shown to have several limitations, such as the assumptions that\nonly contemporaneous inputs matter for current attainment, that inputs do not\nchange over time and that the contemporaneous inputs are uncorrelated with\nthe unobservable, \u0016ij0. Each of these assumptions can be challenged. For in-\nstance, if education production is a cumulative process then historical values\nof the inputs clearly matter, and also input decisions by families may change\nin response to prior (poor) test scores. Consequently, researchers have increas-\ningly moved in the direction of estimating value-added education production\nfunctions.\nThe value-added speci\u0085cation involves adding a (baseline) measure of prior\ntest score attainment, Tija\u00001, to equation 2, and this covariate is regarded as a\nproxy for unobserved historical family and school inputs, as well as unobservable\nmental capacity, \u0016ij0. The baseline measure of attainment should ideally be\nmeasured at the beginning of schooling, or the commencement of a particular\nstage of the educational process (i.e. primary or secondary schooling). Data\nlimitations mean that we have to use test score performance at age 10, which is\nincluded in Equation 2 to give Equation 3 (Model II).\n12\nTij12 = \f0+\f1ETHij+\f2INCOMEik12+\f3Uik12+\f4Sij12+\f5Gij12+\f5Tij10+\"ij12\n(3)\nThis model makes several restrictive assumptions about the nature of the\nproduction technology which relate to the problem of endogeneity of unobserved\nendowed mental capactiy with respect to lagged test score performance (Todd\nand Wolpin 2003). This can lead to biased inference on all covariates, including\nETH. We therefore estimate two further models in an attempt to get round\nthese problems. In the \u0085rst of these approaches (Model III) we simply replace\nthe lagged test performance score, Tij10, by its predicted value using earlier ob-\nservations on inputs, such as income and school characteristics, as instruments.\nInsofar as this approach gives consistent estimates of \f5 it should minimise the\nbias on other inputs, including ETH. The second approach (Model IV) in-\nvolves the estimation of the \u0091test score gain\u0092model, which is more restrictive\nthan Models II and III as it constrains \f5 = 1, however, rather than using in-\nputs measured at age 12 we use those measured at age 10. This assumes that\ndecisions regarding inputs made by families and schools in response to test score\nperformance at age 10 do not vary between the age of 10 and 12. This model is\ngiven by Equation 4, below:\n13\nTij12\u0000Tij10 = \f0+\f1ETHij+\f2INCOMEik10+\f3Uik10+\f4Sij10+\f5Gij10+\"ij10\n(4)\nIn reality INCOME, S and G may change if students change their school\nand or the locality in which they live. In our data, 12% of students move school\nand 15% move area of residence between the ages of 10 and 12. Nevertheless, it\nis likely that these individuals moved between geographic areas with similar in-\ncome levels, and it is also worth noting that average income levels of Australian\nlocal areas do not change substantially over the short-to-medium term (Hunter\nand Schwab 2003). In addition, indigenous geographic mobility is mostly asso-\nciated with movement within local districts (Taylor 1997).\nWe perform a series of sensitivity tests on Models III and IV by estimating al-\nternative speci\u0085cations to investigate how these changes a\u00a4ect the parameters on\nETH: We replace the INCOME and U variables with a series of geographical\narea \u0085xed e\u00a4ects, one for each postcode (355 in total), which has the advantage\nof controlling for unobserved non-time varying locality e\u00a4ects (Models III\n0\nand\nIV\n0\n). It could also be argued that our vector of school inputs is incomplete. To\ntest whether this is the case we use the school identi\u0085cation number to create\na set of school level \u0085xed e\u00a4ects replacing our group of school level character-\nisitcs (826 in total) and included these in addition to our local area \u0085xed e\u00a4ects\n(Models III\n00\nand IV\n00\n). Finally, in view of the high degree of spatial sorting\nof indigenous groups in Queensland, which creates di\u00a4erences in the education\n14\nprocess to which students are exposed, we remove the restriction that \f1 is the\nsame for students in very di\u00a4erent localities by re-estimating all of the models\nseparately for students in urban and rural\/remote areas.\n4 RESULTS\nTable 3 provides results from the estimation of Models I and II. Model I suggests\nthat after controlling for contemporaneous observable family and school char-\nactersitics there are statistically signi\u0085cant di\u00a4erences in attainment between\nindigenous and ESB students. Aboriginal boys appear to perform marginally\nworse than their Torres Strait Islander counterparts in literacy and numeracy.\nIn terms of z-scores, indigenous students lie between 0.66 and 0.80 of a standard\ndeviation below ESB students, which are large e\u00a4ects 6 . School inputs also de-\ntermine test score performance, insofar as students in remote schools and schools\nwhere teachers have less experience have a statistically signi\u0085cant negative e\u00a4ect\non performance, albeit the latter at a declining rate. Notice, however, that the\nestimated z-scores are much smaller than those for the two indigenous variables\nsuggesting that they are quantitatively less important correlates of test score\nperformance. Average teacher hours per pupil is positively related to test score\nperformance.\nINSERT TABLE 3\nModel II introduces a control for prior attainment at the age of 10. Since\n6To compute the z-scores the raw test score is transformed using the following formula\nTi12\u0000T\n\u001bT\nand the models are re-estimated.\n15\nthis is a value added model, we interpret the estimates as e\u00a4ects on the change\nin test score performance between the ages of 10 and 12. The estimates indi-\ncate that indigenous students educational attainment continues to diverge from\nESB students over this period, although the value of the z-scores are substan-\ntially lower than for Model I, ranging from -0.12 of a standard deviation for\nmale Torres Strait Islanders in numeracy to -0.34 of a standard deviation for\nfemale Torres Strait islanders in literacy. This re\u0087ects the extent to which in-\ndigenous students are falling behind the average student\u0092s improvement in test\nscores over the period. Furthermore, there is some divergence in educational\nperformance between indigenous groups, namely Aboriginal males literacy per-\nformance declines relative to Torres Strait Islander boys (F-Test = 4.85, p-value\n= 0.03). Educational performance is, however, cumulative for all groups of stu-\ndents, insofar as there is a positive coe\u00a2 cient on the lagged test score variable.7\nNote also that all of the other estimates in Model II are reduced in magnitude\nby the inclusion of the lagged test score variable, re\u0087ecting the bias that can be\ninduced as suggested in the previous section.\nINSERT TABLE 4.\nIn Table 4 we present the estimates of Models III and IV but for brevity we\nonly report estimates of ETH . Model III replaces the lagged test performance\nscore in Model II, with a predicted lagged test score that is generated using\ncharacteristics as at age 10. Model IV is the test score gain model (Equation\n7The relatively high coe\u00a2 cient for mathematics implies that students who do not have\ngood basic mathematics skills by age 10 \u0085nd it di\u00a2 cult to catch-up in maths. This is less\nmarked for literacy where the opportunity for catch-up is greater.\n16\n4).\nLooking \u0085rst at the literacy results, the use of the predicted lagged test score\nvariable suggests that the estimates of ETH in Model II may have overstated\nthe change in ethnic disadvantage in literacy. However, Aborigines still sig-\nni\u0085cantly under-achieve against ESB and NESB students, whereas for Torres\nStrait Islanders this is only true of females. There are no clear indications of\nbias in the numeracy estimates of ETH in model II. Models III\u0092and III\u0094, which\nincorporate \u0085xed e\u00a4ects for geographic area and school attended respectively\nwere also estimated but are not reported for brevity. The inclusion of controls\nfor local area e\u00a4ects (III\u0092) did not markedly change the estimates of ETH. How-\never, the introduction of school level e\u00a4ects (III\u0094) lead to a widening of the\ndi\u00a4erence between ESB and indigenous test score achievement, particularly in\nnumeracy. 8 Thus, poor indigenous performance appears robust to controls for\nunobservable school characteristics.\nThe second panel of Table 4 presents the estimates of the test score gain\nmodels (Model IV). The results are broadly similar to those for model III.\nWhen we introduce controls for unobservable local area e\u00a4ects (Model IV0) the\nestimates for the Aboriginal group are largely una\u00a4ected, whereas there is an\nimprovement in the achievement of Torres Strait Islanders in both literacy and\nnumeracy, an e\u00a4ect that is further ampli\u0085ed when school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects are intro-\nduced (Model IV\n00\n). This suggests that prior attainment, unobserved local area\nand school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects account for a substantial proportion of the deterioration\n8 In addition, the estimate of the di\u00a4erence between Torres Strait Islander and ESB literacy\nperformance widens and becomes signi\u0085cant for boys.\n17\nin test score achievement of Torres Strait Islanders between the ages of 10 and\n12. Furthermore, a series of F-tests comparing Aboriginal with Torres Strait\nIslander coe\u00a4ecients demonstrate that the two groups signi\u0085cantly di\u00a4er with\nrespect to literacy performance for males in all models.\n4.1 Urban and Rural\/Remote\nIn Table 5 we relax the assumption that the e\u00a4ect of ETH on test perfor-\nmance is the same for students in urban and rural\/remote areas. Comparing\nthe ETH coe\u00a2 cients across the urban and rural=remote models, we see that\nfemale indigenous students in rural\/remote schools have substantially inferior\ntest score achievement compared with their urban counterparts, after controlling\nfor observable di\u00a4erences. They are one standard deviation below the average\nperformance level for rural\/remote female students, wich is the largest educa-\ntional gap that we observe. Aboriginal boys in rural\/remote areas have lower\nattainment in literacy at age 12 than their Torres Strait Islanders counterparts\n(F-Test = 3.44, p-value = 0.06).\nINSERT TABLE 5\nStudents for whom English is a second language perform between 23 and 45\npoints worse on test scores in rural\/remote schools (z-scores of -0.25 and -0.60),\nan e\u00a4ect that is not apparent for urban students. Hence, indigenous students in\nthe more remote areas of Queensland will have a larger educational disadvantage\nthan their ethnicity alone would suggest if English is their second language.\nFor instance, Aboriginal girls in rural\/remote areas for whom an indigenous\n18\nlanguage was their \u0085rst language would be expected to achieve a literacy test\nscore some 109 points less than an ESB student, which equates to a schooling\nde\u0085cit of more than 2 years.\nINSERT TABLE 6\nEstimates of the model which controls for prior attainment (Model II) are\npresented in Table 6. Results from these models suggest that urban Torres\nStrait Islander boys no longer su\u00a4er from a relative decline in numeracy with\nrespect to urban ESB boys between age 10 and 12. There is also some decrease\nin the relative disadvantage of rural\/remote indigenous students when compared\nto urban indigenous students, suggesting that prior attainment accounts for a\nlarge fraction of the discrepancy between urban and rural\/remote indigenous\nstudents\u0092test score performance. Whilst the inclusion of prior attainment re-\nsults in no e\u00a4ect of ESL on rural\/remote numeracy scores for this age period,\nits impact on literacy performance remains large and signi\u0085cant, indicative of a\ncumulative e\u00a4ect for students who reside in ESL households. Aboriginal girls in\nrural\/remote areas experience a larger relative decline in test score performance\nbetween year 5 and year 7 when compared to their urban counterparts (literacy\nF-Test = 10.21, p-value = 0.002; numeracy F-Test = 3.60, p-value = 0.06).\nTo further investigate the di\u00a4erences between urban and rural\/remote indige-\nnous students we generated predicted year 7 test scores by indigenous group,\nlocation and whether English was their second language. These predictions were\ngenerated from Model I coe\u00a2 cient estimates with all other variables evaluated\nat their sample means. The results suggested that, for instance, male Aboriginal\n19\nstudents in rural\/remote locations for whom English is a second language are 48\npoints behind their urban counterparts in literacy. For females the equivalent\n\u0085gure is 83 points. In general, the urban to rural\/remote di\u00a4erential is not as\nsevere for Torres Strait Islanders. A series of F-tests also show that there was a\nstatistically signi\u0085cant di\u00a4erence only for Aboriginal students9 . Hence, in terms\nof primary school education geographical location does not a\u00a4ect Torres Strait\nIslander performance.\nINSERT TABLE 7\nTable 7 presents the estimates of models III and IV modelled separately for\nurban and rural\/remote schools. For urban students, the impact of including\nthe predicted test score variable leads to some reduction in ESB-indigenous\nliteracy test achievement gap, but no such change occurs for numeracy. There\nis a similar pattern for rural\/remote students, except in the case of numeracy\nperformance where indigenous performance decreases.\nAgain additional models incorporating geographic and school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects\n(models III\u0092and III\u0094) were estimated but are not reported. In the case of urban\nstudents, the introduction of local area \u0085xed e\u00a4ects leads to some worsening\nin indigenous disadvantage for males but there is no clear pattern for females.\nFor rural\/remote students, local area \u0085xed e\u00a4ects have little impact. For male\nstudents in urban schools, the further inclusion of school level \u0085xed e\u00a4ects serve\nto increase the estimated ESB to indigenous di\u00a4erential in numeracy test score\n9Test statistic results for urban versus rural\/remote Aborigines (p-values): male literacy\n(0.01), female literacy (0.00), male numeracy (0.00), female numeracy (0.00). Test statistic\nresults for urban versus rural\/remote Torres Strait Islanders (p-values): male literacy (0.99),\nfemale literacy (0.38), male numeracy (0.23), female numeracy (0.77).\n20\nachievement. A similar but less pronounced e\u00a4ect is evident for females. Torres\nStrait Islander boys in rural\/remote schools appear to perform even worse rela-\ntive to ESB students once school \u0085xed e\u00a4ect controls are incorporated. This is\nquite marked, leading to a 70% or greater increase in the size of estimated test\nscore di\u00a4erential. For rural\/remote Aborigines, only the estimates for numeracy\nare particularly a\u00a4ected by the inclusion of school level \u0085xed e\u00a4ects.\nModel IV estimates for urban students are largely consistent with model III,\nexcept female Aboriginal literacy displays no relative deterioration. However,\nthe \u0085nding that female indigenous students in urban schools su\u00a4er a substantial\ndecrease in numeracy test score achievement appears robust. Also, in this model\nrural\/remote indigenous boys\u0092literacy performance does not decline relative to\nESB students over this time period. However, they do su\u00a4er from a widening\ngap in numeracy test scores. Indigenous girls in rural\/remote schools face a\nrelative decline in both literacy and numeracy test scores.\nFor urban students, the inclusion of local area \u0085xed e\u00a4ects (model IV\u0092) has\nno impact on the estimated ESB to indigenous test score gain di\u00a4erential. The\nonly exception is female Torres Strait Islander\u0092s numeracy performance, where\nlocal area \u0085xed e\u00a4ects reduce the estimated impact from -18 to -12 test score\npoints. For urban students, the gap between ESB and indigenous students is\nrobust to the inclusion of school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects (modle IV\u0094).\nFor rural\/remote students, the main change brought about by local area\n\u0085xed e\u00a4ects is to make the di\u00a4erential insigni\u0085cant for Torres Strait Islander\nboys in numeracy and girls in literacy. This suggests that the estimates in model\n21\n(IV) were due to these students residing in areas that were unobservably worse\n(in terms of generating the respective test scores). The inclusion of school \u0085xed\ne\u00a4ects leads to the female Aboriginal literacy di\u00a4erential becoming insigni\u0085cant,\nand the female Torres Strait Islander numeracy di\u00a4erential is only marginally\nsigni\u0085cant. The impact of being an Aboriginal on test score gain in numeracy\nappears to be robust to the inclusion of school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects.\n5 CONCLUSION\nThis paper provides the \u0085rst econometric study of primary school test score\nachievement for indigenous groups in Australia. We use a unique database to\nexamine the magnitude of the test score di\u00a4erential between indigenous and non-\nindigenous students (ESB) at age 12, and analyse how this gap evolves between\nthe ages of 10 and 12. To do this, we estimate a range of education production\nfunctions, following Todd and Wolpin (2003), in an attempt to minimise the\nbias in our estimates of the test score gap. Furthermore, not only do we disag-\ngregate indigenous students into two distinct ethnic groups, namely Aboriginal\nAustralians and Torres Strait Islanders, we also investigate the impact of the\nspatial segregation of these groups on their educational attainment.\nOur raw data suggests that indigenous students at the age of 12 are on\naverage over 70 points behind in numeracy and roughly 60 points behind in\nliteracy (where the benchmark average is 700 points). This di\u00a4erential was\nrobust and large in magnitude across all models, even after the introduction of\ncontrols for observable and unobservable school and local area characteristics.\n22\nOur \u0085ndings suggest that a substantial indigenous educational disadvantage\nappears to take hold quite early in the education process, through the impact of\nhistorical education and family inputs. This is similar, but greater in magnitude,\nto evidence for black-white primary school educational di\u00a4erentials in the US\n(Todd and Wolpin 2004).\nOur results show that indigenous students in rural and remote areas expe-\nrience, in general, worse outcomes than those in urban areas, which has been\nrecognised by the Australian government in its strategy on disadvantaged areas.\nNevertheless, the focus of Federal intiatives on indigenous education policy has\nbeen through the provision of additional grants with little speci\u0085c direction on\nhow these should be applied (Mellor and Corrigan 2004). The evidence in this\npaper would suggest that targeting early school years would be appropriate to\nbuild up core skills. However, policy must go beyond intervention in the early\nstages of schooling because there is substantial evidence that other pre-market\nfactors, such as parental roles and cultural factors also have a large conditioning\ne\u00a4ect on subsequent labour market performance for minority groups (Neal and\nJohnson 1996, Carneiro et al 2003, Todd and Wolpin 2004). The \u0085nding that\nschool characterisitcs play a relatively minor part in the development of educa-\ntional disadvantage in our own study certainly adds weight to this view. Some\nindication of this can be gained from the signi\u0085cant additional negative e\u00a4ect\non test score outcomes for indigenous students who reside in rural or remote\nhouseholds where English is not the language spoken at home. In this respect\nwe are, in general, supporting the \u0091contact\/assimilation\u0092 hypothesis of Kuhn\n23\nand Sweetman (2002). Thus, Federal initiatives to provide homework\/tutoring\ncentres might be bene\u0085cial, though access to such centres in remote areas might\nbe an issue. This is not to suggest, however, that school factors are unimportant\nsince it has been shown that teacher interaction with indigenous students and\nthe appropriatness of the educational materials used do have an e\u00a4ect on their\neducational attainment (Ruge 1999, Tatum 2000).\nThere is some evidence from our analysis that, when data allows, Aborigine\nand Torres Strait Islander should be treated separately in further research. Our\nevidence supports the earlier \u0085ndings of Biddle et al (2004) who reported that\nTorres Strait Islander education participation rates were signi\u0085cantly better\nthan those of Aborigines. We add to this picture by demonstrating that there are\ngeographic and gender di\u00a4erences in performance. Geographic location matters\nmuch more for Aboriginal student performance than it does for Torres Strait\nIslanders. In addition, Torres Strait Islander boys attain appreciably better test\nscores in literacy than their Aboriginal counterparts.\nIn sum, it is evident that policy initiatives will need to be undertaken early in\nthe education process, and address more than school resources to improve the\neducational performance of indigenous students particularly in disadvantaged\nareas, a policy which runs counter to much of the current focus of Australian\nindigenous education policy.\n24\nREFERENCES\nABS (1995) National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Survey 1994: de-\ntailed Findings, Cat No. 4199.0, AGPS, Canberra.\nABS (1997) National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Survey: Torres Strait\nIslander Queensland, Cat No. 4179.3, AGPS, Canberra.\nABS (2002a) Demography: Queensland, Cat No.3313.3, AGPS, Canberra.\nABS (2002b) Population Distribution: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\nAustralians, Cat No. 4705.0, AGPS, Canberra.\nBiddle, N, Hunter, B. and Schwab, R.
