This \nresearch is exploratory in nature and provides empirical support to several propositions found in the \ninnovation management literature on the development of new products.  This paper examined why \nproduct development delays occur, the nature of these delays, and what could be done in order to avoid \nthem.      \n \n \nKeywords \n \nNew Product Development, New Products, Product Innovation, Product Development \nCycle Times. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIntense global competition, rapid technology change and shifting patterns of world \nmarket opportunities compel companies to continually invest in New Product \nDevelopment (NPD); if not for profit, then for survival, and this is considered to be \nthe one of the key\u2019s to success for many businesses (Booz, Allen and Hamilton, 1991; \nCooper and Edgett, 2003; Gerwin and Ferris, 2004; Hart et al, 2003; Wheelwright and \nClark, 1992).  Subsequently, the advance of new products and their development is \nwidely recognised as an important source of competitive advantage (Owens, 2004).  \nOne issue that assists this, is timeliness and having the flexibility to readily expedite \nthe NPD process (Owens and Davies, 2000).  Great importance has been given to this \nissue due to the increasing costs of slow product development.  The \u201ctime is money\u201d \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n1\nscenario has mostly been closely associated with NPD, however, the realisation many \nbusinesses are facing up to is just how much this process is costing, in order for it \nremain competitive and profitable (Ozer, 2004).  Hutlink et al (2000) indicates \nproducts that come to market six months late but on budget earn thirty three percent \nless profit over five years.  In contrast, coming out on time and fifty percent over \nbudget cuts profits by only five percent (Cooper et al, 2004a).  Davis (2002) suggests \nbusinesses with short product development cycles often outperform businesses with \nlong development cycles.     \n \n Historical Background to NPD \n \nSome businesses not only want to accelerate their NPD efforts, they also like to be a \n\u2018first to market\u2019 business.  However, Porter (1985) indicates this strategy has its own \nrisks as well as competitive advantages.  There are numerous cases where businesses \nfirst to launch a new product did not profit from their innovations as much as their \nfollowers, for example, Bowmar (pocket calculator) and Xerox (office computer).  \nRobinson and Chiang (2002) suggest several strategies to accelerate product and \nprocess development and these can be summarised as: \n \n\u2022 Reliance on external sources through buying, licensing or out sourcing. \n\u2022 Reliance on intensified internal R&D programmes through increasing rewards \nfor successful performance, organising internal competition in research, and \ninitiating simultaneous R&D on successive stages of innovation. \n\u2022 Reliance on innovative R&D management strategies such as peer reviews to \naccelerate progress, avoiding the quest for perfection, and closer integration of \nR&D with other functions. \n \nRobinson and Chiang (2002) also indicate this is a positive step in understanding how \ncompanies can accelerate their innovation processes; however, it needs empirical \ntesting in order to determine which strategies work best, under what conditions, and \nfor which type of products. \n \nAnother approach is to study the deficiencies of existing product development \nsystems.  For example, Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) suggest a successful NPD \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n2\nprocess is more like the game of rugby than a relay race.  Rugby is a team effort \nwhere its members continually interact until the game is over.  Whereas, a relay race \nis more like a typical sign-off procedure followed in many companies whereby the job \nmoves from one functional department to another.  Such linear, relay race-type \nprocesses are often slow, inflexible, and in efficient.  Schilling and Hill (1998) found \nfast-cycle businesses prefer teams over functions and departments, they use time as a \ncritical performance measure, and they insist everyone learn about customers, \ncompetitors, and the businesses own operations, not just top management. \n \nCooper and Kleinschmidt (2000) found although many managers profess to have a \nystematic process plan in place for product development, an audit of what actually \ns that in order to rush \nroducts to market, many key NPD activities are often ignored.  This can lead to poor \nhy product development delays \nccur, the nature of these delays, and what could be done in order to avoid them.   \nely \nased on the intuitive competencies of the core NPD team\/personnel, it was decided \ns\nhappens \u2018on the shop floor\u2019 reveals many gaps and deficiencies.  They found a \nnumber of often-critical activities were omitted altogether, and other key activities \nwere superficially or weakly undertaken.  Another study (Bajaj et al, 2004) relating to \nproduct success rate with the number of product design activities performed found \napproximately thirty four percent of the businesses involved in the study performed \nall the key design activities.  The study found performing more product design \nactivities, as compared with engaging in fewer activities, was consistently associated \nwith statistically significantly higher new product success rates. \n \nHowever, performing more steps can take more time.  It appear\np\ndesign, product malfunctioning, product liability claims, expensive product recalls, \nand potential higher production costs (Cooper et al, 2004a).  The challenge is not to \ncut corners or avoid undertaking important steps, but to carry out the task of NPD \nfaster without sacrificing quality or eliminating steps.   \n \nResearch Methodology: the \u201cholistic\u201d approach  \n \nThis study is exploratory in nature and examined w\no\n \nDue to the dynamic nature of the area of study where NPD decision-making is larg\nb\n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n3\nto use multiple research strategies.  Based on the ontological foundations of \nconstructivist realism, the findings should be understood as constructions rather than \ndescriptions (Cupchik, 2001).  From this perspective the researcher employed a multi-\nstage approach using both quantitative (survey) and qualitative research techniques \n(interviews).  The implications are that the twelve SME\u2019s involved in this study can \nhave different \u2018millstones\u2019 hanging from their epistemological necks.  However, in \nthis paper, the arbitrary boundaries and assumptions that separate them have been \neliminated where the researcher is hopeful this interplay between descriptive richness \nand experimental precision can bring accounts of social phenomenon within the NPD \narena to progressively greater levels of clarity (Cupchik, 2001).  The philosophical \nunderpinning is \u201cwe can uncover all kinds of relationships in our hard data, but it is \nonly through the use of soft data we are able to explain them\u201d (Mintzberg, 1979).  \nSubsequently, the focus on this research is how the core NPD team personnel at the \ntwelve SME\u2019s view their world and consider what they see as reality, according to \ntheir own paradigm (Radford and Goldstein, 2002), where the outcomes of the \nresearch will be relative to the researcher, the researched and the reader\u2019s \ninterpretation (Creswell, 1994).  \n \nPiloting of Data Collection Methods \ner refine the data collection plans with respect \n both the content of the data and the procedures to be followed (Gill and Johnson, \n staff of an SME were used to pilot the two research techniques.  \nhis SME was currently involved with a research programme at the researcher\u2019s \n \nThe pilot case study helped the research\nto\n1997).  The pilot inquiry was much broader and less focused than the ultimate data \ncollection methods and covered both substantive and methodological (Yin, 1994) \nissues.  Therefore, in an effort to develop a more reliable data collection method, a \npilot test of both quantitative (survey) and qualitative research techniques (interviews) \nwas conducted.   \n \nManagement and\nT\ninstitution and frequently practised the development of a new product therefore, this \nwas both an accommodating and easily accessible company to pilot.  As a direct result \nfrom this pilot study, feedback and experiences resulted in some of the questions \nbeing modified and changed. \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n4\n The Survey \n \nThe survey was the first method of data collection and distributed to all core NPD \nersonnel who were involved with NPD at their respective company.  A \u2018cooling off\u2019 \nn to the way questions were worded in the survey (Churchill, \n995).  Questions were worded using direct and specific language, with a \ng process was conducted over a six-month period with the researcher \neing allowed open access to each SME in order to clarify any matters arising from \n \np\n(Wisker, 2001) period of one month was allowed for each respondent to complete \ntheir questionnaire.  Once this period had passed the researcher assessed the quantity \nof returned questionnaires for each SME, before following up in an attempt to \nmaximise the feedback. \n \nThere was some attentio\n1\nconversational tone (Frey and Mertens Oishi, 1995).  Responses were mutually \nexclusive where only one tick was required.  Wherever appropriate, \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d and \n\u201cN\/A\u201d response were offered in a consistent order.  Some questions were written at \nthe same time as scale development so that consequence of items and responses on the \nquestion could be included.  The questions were arranged in a certain order aimed at \nbeing uncomplicated to make the questions \u2018user friendly\u2019.  All questions were \ngrouped into manageable amounts, and consistency in questioning was also provided.  \nThe type of question varied to provide interest (Gill and Johnson, 1997), although \ntowards the end of the questionnaire similarity in the questions was difficult to avoid.   \n \nThe Interview \n \nThe interviewin\nb\nthe previous meetings.  At the start of the interview the researcher explained the \npurpose of this study and requested the co-operation of the respondents to give their \nsincere answers to the questions, stressing that all answers were treated in the strictest \nconfidence.  Documents such as memorandums, newsletters, manuals and procedures \nrelating to the research were collected, examined and analysed for relevant \ninformation.  Special attention was given to documents and data relating to initiatives \nand activities that were carried out as response to commence on a NPD project. \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n5\n Sample Selection \n \nThe findings for this research are based upon field interviews and a survey of core \nolved in developing new products.  A judgement or purposive \nampling method was used in order to attempt to gain a cross-section of key\/core \nmmes for a number of years and, they had experienced \noth important successes and failures in their innovation programmes.  Each company \nhe total number of responses received was forty-nine which gave a response rate of \neight percent.  One reason for this quite good response rate is the \nsearcher\u2019s good working and professional relationship with each of the SME\u2019s.  \nteam members inv\ns\nparticipants in the NPD process of twelve similar manufacturing based small to \nmedium enterprises (SME) in the North of England.  A total of eighty five personnel \nwere involved in the study that were perceived to be a key part in the NPD process at \ntheir respective company.   \n \nThe specific businesses chosen for the study were selected because they were known \nto have active NPD progra\nb\nwas involved in similar NPD cycle times of approximately eighteen month to two \nyears.  Additionally, the researcher had previous experience working with these \nbusinesses; subsequently both access and cooperation were relatively unproblematic \nand unrestricted, thus facilitating the data collection method satisfactorily.  \n \nResponse Rate \n \nT\njust under fifty \nre\nHowever, it must be noted the researcher had in no way influenced and\/or biased the \nresults.  The reasons for the thirty-six non-returnees were varying from they did not \nwant to participate in the study, to time constraints, had left their current employer, \ndid not feel they were a core member of the NPD personnel\/team etc.  Therefore, \nthere was no clear identifiable trend for this phenomenon.        \n \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n6\nResearch Findings \n \nNeed to Accelerate the NPD Process \n \nWhen asked if the respective businesses had experienced a need to reduce \ndevelopment time for its new products, eighty-eight percent of the respondents \nanswered \u201cyes.\u201d  Additionally, eighty-seven indicated there had also been increased \npressure to develop more new products.  Numerous respondents suggested there was a \nfine balance between getting the product out early and getting it out too early.  To \nrush the product to market, one needs to be particularly concerned with quality \n(Wong, 2002).  Two major reasons given by the respondents for accelerating the NPD \nprocess were: \n \n1. Increased domestic and global competitive pressures. \n2. Rapid technological changes. \n \nOther reasons included: \n \n\u2022 Market demand \u2013 i.e. customers requiring new products developed \nquickly. \n\u2022 A need to meet corporate growth objectives. \n\u2022 Shortening of product life cycles (a combined effect of rapid technological \nchanges, competitive activities and market requirement changes). \n\u2022 Pressure from senior management to speed product development \n\u2022 A desire to be first in an emerging new market \n \nAn overview of these and other reasons are illustrated in Figure 1, the results from the \nNPD process assessment.  In addition to this there were a range of comments made by \nthe respondents regarding the need to accelerate the NPD process: \n \n\u2022 \u201c\u2026because competitors, primarily overseas, are taking our business away \nfrom us.  The fast changing nature of our society is something we are still \nstruggling to come to grips with.  We are finding more and more often \npeople don\u2019t want something that will last for five years, never mind \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n7\ntwenty, they want change more often and we are finding we have to \nrespond to that and quickly.\u201d \n\u201c\u2026because product life cycle\u2022 s seem to be getting ever shorter, therefore \n\u2022 veloped at an ever \n \nthe base or starting blocks erode faster than they use to.  To keep a grip on \nsales, we need to bring new products to market faster.\u201d \n\u201cThe fact that new materials and processes are being de\nquicker pace demands that we must be alert and receptive to using them in \nnews ways, as if we don\u2019t our competitors will.\u201d  \nReasons to Accelerate Product Development Reasons for Product Development Delays \n\u2022 Increased Competition (42%) \n\u2022 Rapid Technological Changes (\n\u2022 Poor definition of product requirements \n(71%) 29%) \n\u2022 Market Demands (11%) \n\u2022 To meet growth objective\n\u2022 logical Uncertainty (58%) Techno\n\u2022 Lack of Senior Management Support (42%) \n\u2022 Lack of Resources (42%) \n\u2022 Poor Project Management (\ns (11%) \n\u2022 Shortening of Product Life Cycle (8%) \n\u2022 Senior Management Pressures (8%) \n\u2022 Emergence of New Markets (5%) \n29%) \n\u2022 Other (20%) \nTeam Members\u2019 major Concerns During the \nNPD Process \n\u2022 Management Style (53%) \n\u2022 Lack of attention to details (47%) \n\u2022 Limited support for innovation (32%) \n\u2022 Lack of Strategic Thinking (18%) \n\u2022 Poor Manufacturing Facilities (16%) \nHow Functional Groups delay the NPD Process\n\u2022 Failure to give NPD programme priority \n(58%) \n\u2022 ly Changing requirements (58%) Continual\n\u2022 Poor internal communication (34%) \n\u2022 Slow response (26%) \nFigure 1.  NPD Process Assessment (Percentages are based on the responses of thirty eight \neasons for Product Development Delays \nespite the increased pressure to develop more new products and the need to \nrespondents). \n \nR\n \nD\naccelerate product development efforts, eighty seven percent of the respondents \nreported most of the reasons, which delayed product development in the past, still \ncontinue to exist in their businesses.  As NPD process has been both well researched \nand documented since the late sixties, this finding is somewhat surprising in the \ntwenty-first century.  Based on the responses from filed interviews involving core \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n8\nmembers of the NPD team, several major reasons for development delays were \nidentified in figure 1.  \n \nPoor Definition of Product Requirements \n \nThis was the issue most respondents cited as their reason for product development \ndelays.  Seventy-one percent of the respondents highlighted that the process was \ndelayed due to poor understanding of customer requirements, and insufficient \nknowledge of a product\u2019s technology and market forces such as competition, \nsuppliers, market forces, distributors etc.  Subsequently, the lack of understanding \nnecessitates frequent changes in the product development and marketing plans.  Poor \ninternal communication and relations also contributed significantly to the difficulty of \ndefining product requirements and developing and freezing design specifications.  \nSome of the respondents described this issue as: \n \n\u2022 \u201cWe need to get a much better understanding of our customer\u2019s needs and \ndesires.  For us to get the customer feedback and interpret it for our own \nuse seems to be a big grey area.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cChanging product requirements causes more delays in product \ndevelopment than anything else.  We don\u2019t have a crystal ball that can tell \nus exactly our future requirements; however, many times we inaccurately, \nor perhaps too hastily, set the requirements and live to regret them later.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cWe could reduce the definition problem by communicating the \nimportance of identifying the customer\u2019s requirements early and \naccurately.  For this we need to plan ahead better and work together with \npeople in other departments across the company.\u201d \n \nThese quotes suggest that integrating R&D, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, \nsuppliers and the customer at an early stage in the NPD process is necessary for \ndeveloping clear product requirements.  Early involvement of various functional \ngroups can help achieve commitment and clarify product requirements before too \nmuch time and money has been invented and opinions have been formed (Cooper, \n2001; Wheelwright and Clark, 1992).  Additionally, this can reduce the response time \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n9\nand need for frequent and unnecessary changes in product definition, marketing, \ndesign and production etc. \n \nTechnological Uncertainties \n \nFifty eight percent of the respondents claimed technological uncertainties as a major \nreason for delay.  Once the delay occurs and newer technology becomes available, \nthere may be a desire to incorporate the latest technological improvement into the \nproduct, subsequently; this can delay the product\u2019s development even more.  The \n\u2018minor aesthetic improvements\u2019 or \u2018might as well syndrome\u2019 can also contribute to \nserious delays due to the inability to freeze product specification in a timely manner.  \nOther common concerns associated with the uncertainty brought about by new \ntechnology included: \n \n\u2022 \u201cIs the new technology compatible with existing product components?\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cHow will the incorporation of new technology affect our ability to make \nincremental product innovations?\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cWill the incorporation of new technology increase the marketability of \nthe product?\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cCan we ensure the quality and reliability of the new technology?\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cHow quickly can we develop or acquire the new technology?\u201d \n \nSenior Management Support \n \nForty-two percent of the respondents claimed the low priority given to NPD \nprogrammes, unrealistic expectations, short-term vision, lack of strategic thinking, \nrisk averseness, and the inability; or perhaps inability; to learn from past failures were \nseen as major reason for product development delays.  Most respondents indicated \nthese issues were a reflection of senior management\u2019s attitudes toward innovation and \nNPD in general.  Meyer et al (2005) claim such attitudes can affect an organisations \ncultural view about innovation.  Representative comments regarding the role of senior \nmanagement during NPD included: \n \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n10\n\u2022 \u201cThe lack of a common vision and its maintenance is our prime problem.  \nIn my opinion this is what senior management needs to do, but don\u2019t.\u201d \n\u2022 When we\u2019ve completed major product developments in a short period of \ntime, quite often, senior management\u2019s active involvement and \ncommitment has been the key to this success.

This has created an even greater need for \nmanagement to prioritise and specify what development efforts will benefit \nthe company the most.\u201d \n \nAs the quotes suggest, senior management can play a major role in setting the climate \nfor important innovative NPD programmes. \n \nLack of Resources \n \nForty two percent of the respondents indicated the lack of resources committed to \nNPD as an important reason for contributing towards programme delay.  Part of this \nproblem could also be attributed to lack of senior management\u2019s support for \ninnovation.  Some respondents claimed their management only gave innovation \nspurious \u201clip service\u201d.  Other respondents complained too many inexperienced \npeople were assigned to work on key projects.  A few respondents noted resources \nwere taken away from important projects that resulted in substantially slowing their \nprogress. \n \nPoor Project Management \n \nTwenty nine percent of the respondents attributed development delays to poor project \nmanagement practices, such as not monitoring the project\u2019s progress, lack of control \nsystems, poor team and cross-functional meeting management practices, complex \nmatrix management structures, undefined and conflicting roles.  There were, however, \nsome respondents who expressed resistance to project controls: \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n11\n \u2022 \u201cThe company uses both mini and major milestones.

Some of the reasons are discussed and \nillustrated further: \n \n\u2022 Removal of pr\nproduct development did not understand the problem correctly, they were not \naware of the problem in time due to ineffective communications channels, they \nwere given low priority to what later proved to be a key new product.  Risk averse \nsenior management allocating inadequate resources to key NPD programmes was \nanother area that delays in product development was associated with.  Some \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n12\nrespondents suggested the difficulty in assessing the impact of delays on a \nproduct\u2019s commercial performance could also contributed to delays.  \nDifficult to accomplish key NPD activities.  NPD is a multi-stage, multi-\ndisciplinary process (Cooper et al, 2004b).  It involves numerous \n\u2022 \ndevelopment \n \nRes\nchilling and Hill, 1998) suggests for successful new products these activities need to \n   \nhe NPD Process \nof technological innovation is complex, \nvolving the effective integration of people, organisational processes and plans.\u201d  If \nstages (Owens, 2000) such as: idea generation, idea screening, concept definition, \ndefining product performance specs, finalising the product design, technical \ntesting, market testing, assessing market potential, developing a business plan, \ndeveloping prototypes, approval from senior management, launch, etc.  It also \ninvolves the management of interfaces between R&D, marketing, engineering and \nmanufacturing (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 2000).  This research investigated how \ndifficult to accomplish these and other NPD activities were perceived and how \nthey might delay the NPD process.  Subsequently, based on findings from both \nprimary and secondary data a catalogue of commonly performed NPD activities \nwas developed.  The respondents rated each activity according to the degree of \ndifficulty in carrying it out (1 = Not difficult, 3 = Neutral\/Undecided, 5 = Very \ndifficult).  The ten most difficult to accomplish activities are illustrated in figure 2.  \nearch (Aiman-Smith et al, 2005; Davis, 2002; Hutlink et al, 2000; Ozer, 2004; \nS\nbe performed.  However, in many NPD programmes several key activities that \ncorrelate highly with product success are either omitted or insufficiently undertaken  \n(Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 2000).  This research found the activities perceived as \n\u2018difficult\u2019 and \u2018very difficult\u2019 were also greatly associated with development delays.  \nThe results in figure 2 suggest the accomplishment of these tasks make innovation a \nmajor business challenge. \n \nMajor Concerns during t\n \nMeyer et al (2005) claim the management \nin\nthere is a break down in any one of these elements or if they are not well integrated, \nthe NPD process comes less effective (Sethi, 2000).

Fifty eight percent \nressed their concern at the low priority given to NPD efforts by functional groups.  \nctional departments were often seen as too busy solving the more immediate \ng\npay attention to important details, are slow to respond, fail to promote good ideas \nthrough the business and, give excuses or blame others rather than accepting \nresponsibilities.  Some other ways in which functional groups can delay the NPD \nprocess are illustrated in figure 1. \n \nDeveloping products quickly and successfully requires a team effort and an \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n17\nmanagement can help this process by ensuring unnecessary restraints that block \neffective teamwork are removed. \n \nPoor Manufacturing Capabilities \ns, unrealistic and uncompetitive production times \nnd costs and, outdated manufacturing facilities.

Many respondents indicated senior management was one of the \ngreatest contributors to short development times.  Management commitment in terms \nof financial and personal resources was the most important form of support.  Some \nrespondents\u2019 also emphasised senior management needs to be aware of product \ndevelopment problems and encourage innovation effectiveness programmes and \ninnovation audits on a business wide basis.  \n \n \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n18\nEarly Involvement of Functional Groups \n \nForty percent of the respondents indicated that to accelerate NPD, key groups such as \nR&D, marketing, engineering and, manufacturing should be involved very early in the \nrocess.  It was also suggested interdepartmental communication can be promoted \nough joint rotation, regular joint review meetings, seminars, joint customer visits \nrketing), social interactions and, through \nhysical proximity of work places.  For example, in its efforts to bring R&D closer to \n Encouraging greater use of modern technology for communicating and \nssing. \n Using multiple approaches to solve problems, even explore unrelated areas for \n Developing a sense of urgency and responding to problems quickly. \n\u2022 ore informal modes with greater priority given to \np\nth\n(R&D, engineering, manufacturing and ma\np\nmarketing and manufacturing, IBM moves some of its researchers out of the \ndevelopment laboratories into the corresponding departments.  This helps put the \nresearch background into other departments and prevents the R&D personnel from \nbeing viewed as an isolated member of the business (Meyer et al, 2005).  Suomala \nand Jokionen (2003) suggest early involvement of various functional groups also \nhelps in defining product requirements before too much money has been spent and \npositions have been solidified. \n \nNew Work Method \n \nThirty three percent of the respondents suggested there was a need for their businesses \nto adopt a new method or style of working.  These were characterised as: \n \n\u2022\ninformation proce\n\u2022\nsolutions. \n\u2022 Being more creative and open to alternatives. \n\u2022\n\u2022 Employing parallel processing of NPD tasks. \nPromoting flexible and m\ninformal communication versus formal e-memos and reports. \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n19\n Early Market\/Technical Testing \n \nAssuring the product is \u2018right\u2019 for the customers\u2019 needs is important in avoiding \nserious delays (Owens and Davies, 2000).  Twenty-five percent of the respondents \nemphasised the need to test the product concept early and insisted on testing it on an \n\u201cas-you-go\u201d basis.  One marketing manager claimed: \n \n\u2022 \u201c\u2026we used to plan as though we knew what the project would be before we \nstarted and we were losing lots of money.  Now we do a much better job of front-\nend work, not committing too much money but doing a smaller project and taking \nit out in the field to get real world evaluation and, we end up getting more of the \nright products.\u201d \n \nEarly involvement of various functional groups can also help achieve early testing \nbecause each group can make a special contribution to the process (Cooper et al, \n1998).  Active customer involvement facilitates the early testing and evaluation of the \nproduct (Hart et al, 2003).   \n \nEffective New Product Organisations \n \nIn order to accelerate the NPD process numerous respondents suggested their \nbusinesses needed to replace weak matrix approaches with strong product champions.  \nRobinson and Chiang (2002) indicate matrix management was intended to be a \ncompromise between functional and project structures but is often ineffective.  They \nfound matrices reflect the characteristics of the dominant form, either functional or \nproject, but rarely both.  Subsequently, its assurance as an effective organisational \ndesign for new products has seldom been realised.  One of the respondents expressed \ndisillusionment with the matrix system: \n \n\u2022 \u201cWe\u2019ve parted from the pure matrix approach to one where projects are often run \nin a single organisational group.  This simplifies the overall co-ordination of \npeople.  Conceptually, matrix management works when you try to co-ordinate one \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n20\nproject, but when you try to co-ordinate numerous projects at the same time it \nhave volunteered.  Some of the \nespondents who were managers during product development claimed: \n\u2022  \nams, and we need to give them more autonomy and ownership.\u201d \n \u201cWe select a team that wants to win.

They \nsuggested team membership should be determined largely by voluntary compliance \nand not by proclamation.  A signing up process could be used to create a NPD team in \nwhich members have not been coerced to join, they \nr\n \n\u201cThe best way to overcome many NPD obstacles is to have a strong champion. \nThe champion should be allowed to pick his or her own team.  People they can \nidentify with, work with and, who will \u2018live\u2019 the project.  We need less people \ninvolved in our te\n\u2022\nneed.  If we have a talented and committed team we can dramatically decrease the \ntime required o get a new product through the system.\u201d \n \nAs can be seen for the previ\nb\n \nI\n \nThis study suggests that the NPD processes currently utilised need reassessing.  This \nresearch indicates that not only does specific processes be examined but also a \nbusinesses culture be assessed to ascertain whether or not it is supportive to \ninnovation, change and ultimately NPD.  Research (Cooper et al, 2004b) indicates \nthat to succeed in NPD and to develop fast-cycle capabilities, businesses need to \nadopt an integrated approach to NPD.  Their approach is characterised by: \n \n\u2022\n\u2022 Overlapping development phases, multi-learning, subtle control, organisational \ntransfer of learning, built-in instability and, tracking time throughout the business. \n\u00a9Owens, J D (2007) \nManagement Decision Journal, vol. 45, no. 2 \n21\nAd\nDe d assessment to identify the initial sets of learning \nbjectives (figure 3), which are required for NPD after the founding groundwork has \nditionally, research by Owens (2004) suggests a framework for New Product \nvelopment Learning (NPDL) an\no\nbeen undertaken in the NPD organisation (figure 4).
