Within this project sits a Knowledge Transfer activity that \nseeks to channel graduate scientists and engineers through an MSc in \u201cUltra Precision \nTechnologies\u201d into UK engineering industry. The creation and implementation of this \npipeline, its systems and its processes, is the subject of this paper and its case study. \nFindings \u2013 In order to recruit graduate scientists and engineers a proactive model is \npresented. An Open Systems model of the pipeline process is derived, and the elements \nwithin the system are discussed. Implementation difficulties are also explained, with \nsuggestions for further work.  \nResearch limitations\/implications \u2013 The paper describes only the early stages of \nimplementation, and further work is necessary. However, there are important lessons to \nbe learned from the early phases of the project which have implications for postgraduate \neducation and UK manufacturing industry. \nPractical implications \u2013 The systems model and case studies provide a framework and \ndetail that is of immediate benefit to manufacturing industries and Higher Education \nestablishments. \nOriginality\/value \u2013 The originality of the approach lies in the level of integration \nbetween the sub-systems that comprise the Open system, within which students and skills \nare forged together in a programme to produce employable engineering postgraduates. \nKeywords \u2013 Engineering, Postgraduate, United Kingdom, Industry, Knowledge Transfer \nPaper type \u2013 Case Study \n \u201eThat\u201fs the reasons they\u201fre called lessons,\u201f the Gryphon remarked: \u201ebecause they lessen \nfrom day to day.\u201f (Carroll, 1865). \n \nIntroduction \nIn order to retain competitive advantage the UK engineering sector requires a \nregular influx of new talent. The demand for new engineers with the knowledge, \ncreativity, and personal skills to make significant contributions to engineering issues in a \ncommercial environment has never been greater. However the pipeline process to supply \nhigh quality engineers is both dynamic and complex. This paper looks at the problems \nperceived by the UK precision engineering sector in recruiting high-calibre graduates, the \nissues involved, discusses methods and processes to minimize the mismatch between \nstudents\u201f aspirations and companies\u201f requirements, and discusses a case study reflecting \nan initiative to minimise the mismatch. \n \nProblem definition \n Despite the pressure from global competition the UK precision engineering \nindustry continues to thrive, and is a key enabling force in a range of modern technology \nrich applications. These include space, aerospace, optics, optoelectronics, machine tools, \nenergy generation (both nuclear fusion and alternative renewable sources), sensors, \ndisplays, and medical. Products can range from prosthetic joints through wind turbines to \nmirror segments for space and ground-based telescopes. The common need for all of \nthese applications is a skilled and effective pool of graduate precision engineers, mainly \nwith a mechanical bias. \n In 1995, the Daily Telegraph wrote, \n\u201cBritain may have many assets; its people are not\u2026.among them. We are too old, we are \npoorly educated and our attitude is appalling. Our inadequate educational system ranks \n35\nth\n (in the world), there is little motivation to retrain for new jobs, and we lack \ncompetitive values such as hard work, tenacity and loyalty. Britain also ranks badly for \nboth gender and race equality. Women in Turkey, Egypt and Colombia have better career \nprospects\u2026.\u201d \nThis was a popular view of the industrial workforce in the previous decade and, unless \nmoderated in the interim, will be a popular view of decision makers within UK industry \ntoday. This view of an inflexible, poorly educated and uncommitted workforce has been a \nfactor in erecting a barrier between employers and prospective employees. At the \ngraduate recruitment level this view may be less prevalent, but there are other causes \naffecting the employability of graduates in UK industry (Rae, 2007). At the supply end of \nthe recruitment pipeline, there are problems connected specifically to \u201cengineering as a \ncareer\u201d, as shown in the UK HE statistics (HESA, 2005\/6). Figure 1 compares the \nnumber  \nUK HE students 2005\/06\n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\n300000\n350000\nS\nub\nje\nct\ns \nal\nlie\nd \nto\n m\ned\nic\nin\ne\nB\nus\nin\nes\ns \n& \nad\nm\nin\nis\ntra\ntiv\ne\nE\ndu\nca\ntio\nn\nS\noc\nia\nl s\ntu\ndi\nes\nC\nre\nat\niv\ne \nar\nts\n &\n d\nes\nig\nn\nB\nio\nlo\ngi\nca\nl s\nci\nen\nce\ns\nLa\nng\nua\nge\ns\nE\nng\nin\nee\nrin\ng \n& \nte\nch\nno\nlo\ngy\nC\nom\npu\nte\nr s\nci\nen\nce\nH\nis\nto\nric\nal\n &\n p\nhi\nlo\nso\nph\nic\nal\nLa\nw\nP\nhy\nsi\nca\nl s\nci\nen\nce\ns\nM\ned\nic\nin\ne \n&\n d\nen\ntis\ntry\nA\nrc\nhi\nte\nct\nur\ne \nan\nd \nre\nla\nte\nd\nM\nas\ns \nco\nm\nm\nun\nic\nat\nio\nns\n\/d\noc\ns\nM\nat\nhe\nm\nat\nic\nal\n s\nci\nen\nce\ns\nA\ngr\nic\nul\ntu\nre\n &\n re\nla\nte\nd \nsu\nbj\nec\nts\nV\net\ner\nin\nar\ny \nsc\nie\nnc\ne\nSubject group\nT\no\nta\nl \nH\nE\n s\ntu\nd\ne\nn\nts\nFigure 1 .

In UK HE women \naccount for only 15.8% of the total students studying Engineering & Technology \nsubjects. For mechanical engineering this percentage falls to 8.5% (HESA,2005\/6). There \nis also research to show that only 28% of women who train as engineers emerge to take \nup employment as a professional engineer thereafter (Setwomenstats, 2004\/5). It is clear \nthat if we wish to deliver a stream of high-quality employment-ready mechanically-\nbiased engineers into precision technology hungry industrial environments we must \nmarket our postgraduate courses and provide learning experiences that meet the \naspirations of both male and female students.  \nIn terms of course design, there is also the need to consider the life and work \nexperience of students. Particularly at the postgraduate level, the age and experience span \nof a typical cohort can be quite broad. This includes those between the ages of 35 and 55 \nwhich (Rae,2005) calls mid-career entrepreneurs or MCEs, and those in the final phase or \ntheir working lives (Blackburn and Mackintosh, 1999). Both of these groups, finding \nthemselves making a career change through choice or necessity, can bolster the supply of \nprecision engineers \u2013 provided that their previous knowledge and experience, their \nlearning capabilities, their aspirations and support needs are designed into the training \npackage. With an aging population and the likelihood that working life will be extended \nas life expectancy increases, the probability of a mid-career change increases. One further \nissue is pertinent to a discussion of course design and student intake. UK (Home) students \naccount for only 34% of the total number studying postgraduate courses (HESA, 2005\/6), \nnot including PhD, PGCE. If one of our major goals is the recruitment, education, and \nretention of precision engineering talent for the benefit of UK manufacturing industry we \nmust ensure that the lack of home-based students is also addressed (but not to the \ndetriment of the reputation of UK HE establishments as pre-eminent in the education of \nEU and Overseas students). \nSystems description \nThe lack of any formal connection between Higher Education and business has \nbeen well documented (Yasin et al, 2000). This situation persisted throughout the latter \nhalf of the last century, and can be modelled as a set of closed systems. The two primary \nsystems of interest are the business (industrial engineering employer) system and the \nteaching and learning system (postgraduate level Masters in the context of this research). \nThese, with the main \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 : Traditional teaching showing the elements of a closed system (after Yasin et al. \n, 2000). \nFaculty and administration\nTeaching and learningStudentsInput\nTraditional inward-looking\norganizational culture\nAssessments Output\nIndustry demand\nfor precision engineers\nKnowledge\nSkills\nsub-systems and process elements of interest are shown in Figure 3. The systems show \nlittle connectivity and exhibit no effective feed forward or feedback control mechanism. \nCourse design and development occur as a top-down implementation of HE \nestablishment strategy, embedded within an inward-facing culture. The end-customers \n(industrial employers) are the recipients of an output that they have little opportunity to \ninfluence. The teaching staff, students, and employers are alienated in this arrangement. \nThe HE institution may find it hard to attract high quality students as the employability of \nthe postgraduates that emerge from the teaching and learning processes is likely to a \nmatter of good fortune. UK students are likely to emerge from their first degree with \nfinancial debts, owing to increasing undergraduate fees and lower grants. Faced with \nincreased choice of postgraduate opportunities, a Masters degree is not a choice to be \ntaken lightly. In this buyers market, the HE institution must adjust its processes to ensure \nmuch closer alignment with the needs of today\u201fs engineering students and the business \nenvironment that demands their knowledge, skills, experience, and emotional \nintelligence. \nThis implies the adoption of an open systems approach.  The system must include \na high level of integration between the system\u201fs components, in particular a partnership \nbetween the HE institution and the employer.  Figure 4 shows an open systems model \nwhich is  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Open systems model emphasizing company-student engagement \nFaculty and administration\nCourse-level interface\nTeaching and learningStudentsInput\nFlexible outward facing\norganizational culture\nAssessments Output\nCompany, student, and \nHE establishment \nengagement\nBusiness and HE\npartnership (IKC)\nIndustry demand\nfor precision engineers\nKnowledge\nSkills\nExperience\nMaturity\nEmployability\nbased on the work of (Yasin et al, 2000), but extended to meet the special requirements \nof  UK precision engineering clients. In particular, there is a need for greater engagement \nbetween students and employers at all stages in the recruitment and learning processes. \nThis is met by the inclusion of an intermediate shell of sub-processes which provide a \nproactive link between individual students and company representatives. These are \ndescribed as the \u201cCourse level interface\u201d and \u201cCompany, student, and HE establishment \nengagement\u201d sub-systems in Figure 4, and are the domain of a dedicated HE academic or \nprofessional.  \n In this model the student is pulled into the teaching and learning sub-system by \nthese \u201cshell\u201d processes which act in addition to the existing HE marketing and \npromotional activities. Interaction with potential employers takes place prior to course \nregistration, and as part of the recruitment process. This link becomes stronger as the \nMasters course progresses, with Company placements and sponsorships available to the \nmost able students. Each participating Company becomes a key stakeholder in the overall \nsystem, with interest in student recruitment, the course content, project work, and \nassessment criteria. The shell processes are intended to collect and process the outputs \nfrom the student and company experiences in order to enhance both the teaching process \nand the design of the overall system. As described later, the benefits of the proactive \nengagement between the HE establishment, UK engineering employers, and the \nprospective postgraduate student are reflected in the percentage intake of UK students \nand female applicants to the Cranfield University MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d. \n \nThe Integrated Knowledge Centre (IKC) in Precision Engineering \n Joint ventures between educational institutions and companies have been created \nin a number of fields, including mechanical engineering (Kettunen, 2006). In the context \nof UK precision engineering this top-level platform is provided by a unique partnership \nbetween UK academia and industry, the UPS\n2\n Integrated Knowledge Centre (IKC). \nThe Ultra Precision and Structured Surfaces Integrated Knowledge Centre (UPS\n2\n) \nwas initiated in January 2007 through an EPSRC \"pilot\" call. IKCs are intended to \ndevelop new approaches to support UK industry through a wide range of industry-facing \ntechnology transfer and innovation initiatives. A key demand in establishing IKCs was \nthat they focus on wealth creation activities and as such they should themselves become \n\"self supporting after the initial 5 year EPSRC funding period\". \nThe mission of UPS\n2\n is to establish a world-leading Centre of Excellence that \ndelivers to UK industry 'disruptive' technologies enabling the development and \nmanufacture of a wide range of next generation products which are dependent on \nfunctional ultra precision and structured surfaces. \nUPS\n2\n is a unique centre based around established partnerships between Cranfield \nUniversity, University College London and University of Cambridge, together with the \nTechnium OpTIC. UPS\n2\n is located at the Technium Optic (OpTIC) amongst the \ncompanies forming the significant North Wales opto-electronics business cluster. OpTIC \nis itself a dedicated knowledge transfer and business incubator centre and is therefore an \nideal location for establishing an industry-facing knowledge transfer and innovation \ninitiative on behalf of EPSRC. \nUPS\n2\n is concerned with the manufacturing technologies relating to ultra precision \nand structured surfaces as applied to many next generation products. Such surfaces are \napplied within products across a wide spectrum of markets including: optoelectronics and \ndisplays, medical devices, aerospace, defence, space and automotive sectors. These \nsectors represent over \u00a375 billion annual business in the UK and account for a major \npercentage of UK export trade. UPS\n2\n therefore provides support for the design and \nmanufacture of UK products having a competitive edge, which is achieved through the \napplication of ultra precision and structured surfaces. \nSuccess will be identified as a self-funding UK Centre of Excellence housed at the \nTechnium OpTIC. It will have world class research facilities with a vibrant research and \nIP portfolio, supporting the introduction of new UK products. It will operate innovative \ntechnology transfer initiatives which support the competitiveness of the UK companies \nwhich it serves. In international terms the IKC will be recognized as the leading Centre of \nExcellence for the development of value adding surface technologies, components and \nhigh value products. Furthermore, it will support engagement of UK industry into large \nscale science programmes that demand ultra precision technologies. The Management  \n  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n                                Figure 5: UPS\n2\n IKC Management structure \n \nstructure of the UPS\n2\n IKC is shown schematically in Figure 5. It is important to \nemphasise the depth of the interactions between the academic partners and the \nparticipating companies. Although it is the knowledge transfer activities that are of most \ninterest in the context of this paper, there is an opportunity for a precision engineering \npartner to link through facilities, equipment, and R&D too. Within the Knowledge \nTransfer programme the MSc course is supplemented by industrial short courses, whilst \ndeveloping e-learning packages for the future. It is the Knowledge Transfer sub-system \nthat includes the processes that provide the important intermediate shell of sub-processes \nthat are shown in Figure 4. \n \nPractical implementation \n \n1.Course design \nOne key objective is to present UK industry with precision engineers possessing not only \nthe appropriate technical skills at a high level but also the soft personal skills that enhance \nemployability. According to the \u201cDOTS\u201d model , which is based on the QAA (2001) \nCode of Practice, these skills include (Rae, 2007): \n(a) Self-awareness \n(b) Opportunity awareness \n(c) Decision making \nUPS\n2\n Management Team \n \nKnowledge \nTransfer \n \nFacilities & \nOperations \n \nR&D Portfolio \n \n \nKey Partners \nand \nCustomers \nProject \nApproval \nPanel \nUPS\n2\n Steering Group \n(d) Transition learning \n \nWomen are attracted to engineering, but their experience in HE discourages them from \npursuing that career path (Powell et al., 2004). This is a different problem from one of \nrecruitment into postgraduate education, and is indicative of a gender bias within the \ninternal content and culture of the course. This being the case, it is an issue that we can \naffect within course design. Two factors that we can incorporate directly into the teaching \nstrategy involve the female preferences for hands-on learning (Madhill et al., 2003) and \nelements of management (Srivastava, 1996). Also, in order to encourage female \nengineers to continue beyond the end of the course, a company placement for the \nindividual Masters project is included. \n \nThe MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d is divided into three components:- \n \n(i) A taught component, given as a series of one-week modules and including lectures, \ntutorials, case studies, laboratory demonstrations, workshops and exercises as \nappropriate.  These are summarised in Table 1. \n \n(ii) A group project, in which groups of typically 3 - 5 students work as a team on a \nmulti-disciplinary problem of industrial relevance. The project has a strong practical \nbias, preferably with a hardware output, and can attract commercial sponsorship. In \naddition to practising precision engineering skills the students also have the \nopportunity to experience project management and team working, two important \nqualities on the path to achieving enhanced employability. \n \n(iii) An individual research project of industrial relevance. \n \nFor full-time students, the three components are weighted for assessment purposes as \nfollows:  \n \nLecture courses (40%), Group project (20%), Individual project (40%). \n Precision engineering \u2013 \u201eprinciples and state of the art concepts\u201f \nMetrology and optical testing \nManaging innovation and new product development \nComputer-aided engineering for ultra precision \nOptical design and fabrication \nSurface engineering and coatings \nModern optical technologies \nLaser micromachining and surface structuring \n \nTable 1: Taught modules \u2013 MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d \n \nThe taught modules vary in style from traditional lectures for subject based learning, \nthrough experiential learning, to practical sessions with an emphasis on problem based \nlearning. Examples of problem based learning can be found throughout sections of the \n\u201cManaging innovation and new product development\u201d module, whilst experiential \nlearning predominates in the \u201cComputer-aided engineering for ultra precision\u201d module. It \nis the difference in presentation and teaching styles that is designed to address the need \nfor different learning styles, in an attempt to reduce gender bias and increase appeal to \nmid-career change applicants. As discussed by Rae (2005), entrepreneurial learning can \naid the mid-career change applicant by facilitating a successful transition from a role that \nutilises existing skills and expertise to a new role in a field that utilises newly learned \nskills and expertise. In making the transition to Precision Engineering, an MCE may not \nhave the same recollection of basic science and engineering knowledge as a new \ngraduate. This can be addressed during the Induction week, and in tutorials during the \ntaught modules. Group Project work presents both opportunities and issues for the MCE. \nCare is needed to ensure that the MCE is not cast as an outsider within a team of new \ngraduates. Rather, the MCE should be given the opportunity to use their experience of \nproblem solving and common-sense solutions to the good of the team. This can be a fine \nbalance, and a skilled project facilitator may be needed at key decision points within the \nduration of the project.  \n  \n2.Course marketing \nThe Open Systems model of Figure 4 includes sub-systems that reflect the promotion and \nmarketing of the MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d. In particular, the course level \ninterface and the company\/ student engagement processes are key components to reach \nout to students from the appropriate background that have the potential to graduate at \nMasters level and be employable in UK Industry. These sub-systems and processes are \ndescribed in the next section. However there is another high-level system to consider, at \nthe University Faculty or School level. For this system to be effective in promoting and \nadvertising the course, a high degree of organizational flexibility is demanded. This is not \nto be found in the traditional inward-facing model of Figure 3. \n The practical realization of this flexibility is a far from trivial objective. In the \nultimate case it would mean the customisation of central marketing activities to the extent \nthat each course would be marketed individually \u2013 in a drive towards optimisation. This \nis clearly impractical, and is also more the aim of the intermediate course-specific \nprocesses described in the following section. Hence there is a practical limit, a function of \nthe available resources, which limits the degree of customization. In our work, we \nreceived much assistance from the marketing team within the Cranfield University \nSchool of Applied Sciences. This manifested itself in the content, VI (Visual Identity), \nand destination of promotional and marketing collateral. This material was used widely, \nincluding the recruitment process described in the next section. \n \n3.Student recruitment \nThe challenge was to recruit science and engineering graduates onto the Cranfield \nUniversity led (UPS\n2\n framed) MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d. In parallel with the \noutput of the central marketing activities the model of Figure 4 demands a closer \ninteraction with prospective students. The approach taken was to choose two recruitment \nagencies to convey the course details and benefits to potential students. The use of \nrecruitment agents or consultants reflects the fact that new graduates are more job-\nfocused than in previous generations, driven by the need to repay student loans. In \naddition, engineers seeking a mid-career change plus the generally disenchanted are \nnaturally drawn to recruitment agencies. The brief included the requirement to explain the \nhands-on nature of the learning experience and the inclusion of a taught module on the \nmanagement of innovation \u2013 both reported in the literature as being important to female \nstudents in HE (Madhill et al., 2003) and (Srivastava, 1996).  \nThe results of the recruitment process, which took place over an accelerated \nperiod of 10 weeks between July \u2013 September 2007, yielded 10 students who started the \nfull-time MSc in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d at Cranfield University. Of these, eight \nwere \u201cHome\u201d students, with one \u201cEU\u201d and one \u201cOverseas\u201d, as defined by UK HE \nregulations. Although the statistics are small the achievement of 80% \u201cHome\u201d students is \nextremely encouraging, given the fact that the percentage of \u201cHome\u201d students on \npostgraduate courses (except PhD, PGCE) at all UK HE institutions is 34%. The situation \nregarding female students is also promising. 30% of the October 2007 cohort were \nfemale, which compares favourably with the 8.5% women who study mechanical \nengineering at HE level (this statistic includes undergraduate plus postgraduate, \nexcluding PhD and PGCE). \nThe reasons for selecting the course, as given by the students shortly after the \nInduction week, give an insight into the effectiveness of the recruitment process (see \nTable 2 below). The Table gives the ten most important factors, as identified in a \nquestionnaire, according to the students. The reputation of Cranfield University in \ntechnology subjects is a major factor, together with the involvement of University \nCollege London, the University of Cambridge, and OpTIC. Company involvement also \nscores highly, in the guise of enhanced employability plus company placements for \nprojects and financial support. It is also encouraging to note that the students have \nrealized that the course is intended to attract people with a range of first degree \nbackgrounds, and that there is scope not only for employment but also higher level \nresearch on completion of the Masters degree. Other factors scoring highly demonstrate \neffective communication during the recruitment process. This reflects well on the central \nMarketing activity within the University, and is also a feature of the intermediate shell \nprocess of Figure 4. \n Factor Relative \nScore \nCranfield University has a good reputation for technology \n24 \nAttendance at MSc Selection (Company matching) day \n23 \nThis course caters for people with a range of first degree subjects \n22 \nPossibility of staying on to do research (PhD) at Cranfield \n21 \nInformation from website, brochures, University staff \n21 \nStudent bursaries and Company sponsorship \n20 \nIncreased chance of employment at the end of the course \n19 \nUltra Precision technology covers many applications and products \n17 \nI discussed the course with a friend\/colleague\/family member \n17 \nAdditional involvement of UCL, OpTIC, University of Cambridge \n16 \n \nTable 2: Reasons for Course selection \n \nOther comments made by the students at the end of the questionnaire mention the \nambition to find a more fulfilling role in engineering, or the more general ambition to \nmake a career change. It is also interesting to note the qualifications of applicants, at the \ntime of application. By emphasizing the practical nature of the learning experience, and \nthe opportunity for enhanced employability, students with both Masters degrees and \nPhDs applied. As further evidence for the credibility of the course as a retraining medium \nthe applicants also possessed a first degree in a range of subjects. These included the \nexpected subjects of mechanical engineering and physics, but also students with \nqualifications in electronics, chemistry, medical devices, and nuclear technology. \n \n \n \n \n4. Company engagement and student sponsorship \nOur challenge is to provide technically competent and emotionally employable precision \nengineers into UK industry. However, each industrial site will have a different culture \nand we cannot serve the multiple requirements of technical competence, employability, \nand organizational readiness unless we individually prepare students for the experience of \nworking in a specific Company. Many authors have discussed the difficult transition \nbetween higher education and the workplace, including (Heinz, 1999) and (Arnold and \nMackenzie Davey, 1992). In addition (Holden and Hamblett, 2007) extracted three \nthemes from interviews with students after their personal transitions from higher \neducation into UK industry and commerce. These themes reflected the students need to \nlearn the technical aspects of the role, but also to learn to function in an organization and \nto learn or develop the appropriate personal and emotional skills to be an effective \nmember of that organization. The latter two themes, which were identified as vital to a \nsuccessful transition by the students themselves, explain why company placements play \nsuch a key part in the MSc in Ultra Precision Technologies. By undertaking a Masters \nlevel project in a company, the student practices the technical skills that have been \nlearned during the taught courses \u2013 but also has to adapt to working within organizational \nconstraints whilst developing the inter-personal skills that will help to ensure an effective \ncontribution. The taught courses are also marketed as stand-alone short courses, \nproviding the students with additional exposure to industrial delegates. The Group \nproject, although located at Cranfield University, also has a role to play in this. It \nprovides a \u201csafe\u201d environment within which to experience (perhaps for the first time) the \n\u201cforming and storming\u201d stages of a team of diverse individuals. For this reason the \nInduction week (the first week of the Masters course) includes a session to determine and \nappreciate each student\u201fs Belbin team role. \n During the course design stage a number of Companies were approached to \nparticipate in the Company placement scheme. This involves the student spending an \nappropriate length of time on the Company\u201fs premises during the Individual Project \nphase of the Masters degree. This is an important feature of the MSc in Ultra Precision \nTechnologies, carrying 40% of the total marks, and has a typical duration of between 4-5 \ncalendar months. As illustrated in Figure 4 there is a close relationship between the IKC \nin Ultra Precision and structures surfaces, the MSc in Ultra Precision Technologies, and \nthe participating companies. Indeed the majority of the participating companies had some \nprevious involvement with UPS\n2\n and some were sited amongst the North Wales opto-\nelectronics business cluster. At an early stage it was decided to locate an appropriate \nnumber of students in close proximity to the cluster.  \n Choosing to base a group of students within the North Wales opto-electronics \ncluster had wide-ranging implications. The major benefits were to the nearby Companies, \nbut there were financial and regulatory issues for the University. These were anticipated \nhowever, and were included in Figure 4 under the heading of a \u201cflexible outward facing \norganizational culture\u201d within the University. Firstly, the UPS2 facilities at OpTIC \nprovided office and laboratory facilities for the Wales-based students. Local \naccommodation was readily available in the form of rented housing, and there are good \nfinancial arguments for the purchase and conversion of a property into a student hall of \nresidence as the scheme progresses into future years. Further flexibility from the \nUniversity faculty was evident in establishing new processes to allow student \nexaminations to be held simultaneously at Cranfield University and OpTIC, a decision \nthat required considerable planning to ensure the rules and regulations of the University \nwere upheld. As in all such matters, quality control and the integrity of the assessment \nprocess could not be compromised. \n Matching of the student to an Individual Company was a selective and iterative \nprocess, once again portraying the close relationships between the Company, the \nUniversity, the IKC, and the student \u2013 as drawn schematically in Figure 4. One month \nprior to the start of the academic year a \u201cSelection Event\u201d was held, a preliminary step in \nthe process to match students to Companies for the purposes of the Individual project. \nThe event was very well attended by both invited Companies and prospective students. \nDuring the day, which included tours and presentations, students were interviewed by the \nindustrialists in order to assess their suitability for project work.  Great care was taken to \nalign the wishes of Companies to the expectations of students. Since there were more \nstudents than participating companies in the first year of the course the remaining \nstudents were allocated projects within the Cranfield University Precision Engineering \nCentre. \n5. Student assessment \nAs mentioned in the previous section, basing the students at two locations, around two \nhundred miles apart, presented some logistical problems. These required a flexible \nresponse from the Faculty, which was forthcoming once the benefits and additional costs \nhad been explored.  \n However there is the wider issue of how to assess students and gauge their \ntechnical learning, their capability of working in an industrial engineering role, and their \nemotional intelligence \u2013 all contributory factors to employability. The industrial \nexperience that the students gain during their Individual projects is widely reported as \nbeing the best preparation a student can have (Brown, (1996) and Yasin et al, (2000)). \nHowever, we also have to assess the taught elements of the course, only a fraction of \nwhich can be tested in the Group and Individual projects. Also, we must ensure that the \nstudents are correctly assessed from a quality point of view, namely that they have \nachieved the Masters level required for graduation from a UK University. As a set of \nbroad principles we have set out to assess technical learning from the taught course \nmodules, industrial engineering capability and the application of technical learning \nthrough the Individual Project, and emotional intelligence during both Group and \nIndividual Projects.  \n The eight taught modules listed in Table 1 employ more than one teaching style, \nranging from traditional lectures and tutorials through computer-based packaged learning \nto business simulations and role playing. A deliberate attempt was made to mix problem-\nbased learning and subject-based learning, to cater for the diverse student population. The \nassessment strategies reflect this, with a mixture of closed book examinations, written \nassignments and reports, and software models. \n The Group project is assessed by means of a written report and an oral \npresentation. As well as testing the application of technical learning we should remember \nthat the Group Project is also designed to examine the student\u201fs ability to work with \ncolleagues in a simulated work-team, and also to observe interpersonal maturity. The \nmain issue in assessing Group projects is to extract an individual mark that reflects the \nstudent\u201fs contribution. In parallel with the traditional methods of supervisory marking, \nwe have designed a blind and holistic peer review process (Russell et al., 2006) to that \nend. The results of this will be presented in a later paper.  \n The individual project accounts for 40% of the overall Masters degree in \u201cUltra \nPrecision Technologies\u201d, and is based around a written thesis. Marks are allocated for \nproject approach, execution, and presentation (both written and oral). However since the \nIndividual Project is company based, it is also designed to enhance employability and the \nability to work effectively in an industrial engineering role. This is not currently assessed \ndirectly, and further work is needed to develop a framework to achieve this. \n  \nConclusions \nIn order to retain competitive advantage, UK precision engineering industry requires a \nregular supply of technically proficient and organizationally prepared graduates. This \npaper has explained the approach taken at Cranfield University to increase the size of the \npool of postgraduate precision engineers. The approach involves the design of a multi-\nlevel system, which draws on increased connectivity between the University, UK \nEngineering companies, and the student. The main vehicle for providing the technical \ntraining is the postgraduate Masters degree in \u201cUltra Precision Technologies\u201d. We have \nexplained how this course has been designed for broad appeal, whilst incorporating world \nclass technical teaching and an external focus on the needs of participating companies. \nImplementation is described in the first year of study, and includes an analysis of the \nrecruitment and company placement processes. \n The key lessons to be learned from our case study have relevance to a wider field. \nAcademic institutions need to exhibit the appropriate flexibility to meet the demands of \nindustry and the aspirations of the student. Unless the systems of student recruitment, \ncourse delivery, and course content are efficiently aligned, the output of the course will \nbe sub-optimal. At best, these systems should be integrated with industrial partners who \nbecome stakeholders to the extent of playing a key role in adjusting the content of the \ncourse. Also, course designers need to take advantage of the opportunities to attract mid-\ncareer entrants, male and female applicants where there is a notable gender bias, and \nmore home (UK) students where UK demand currently exceeds supply. This is \nachievable by meticulous planning of course content, course structure and duration, \nteaching and learning style, assessment strategies, project work and company \ninvolvement. For students who face a sometimes bewildering number of postgraduate \nopportunities, it is unsurprising that recruitment is dependent upon the level of \nengagement with the course team during the application and registration processes. The \nchallenge here is to develop processes that allocate resources in the most efficient \nmanner, bearing in mind that it is the personal contact that the students most cherish, \nparticularly from academic staff. Finally, much can be gained from partnerships between \nUniversities to plug a particular skills gap at the postgraduate level. However, this is \nlikely to bring increased costs which must be recouped as part of an overall strategic plan \n\u2013 for example the sale of industrial short courses and distance learning packages. \n Future work will enable us to analyse a larger sample of students and Companies. \nThere will also be a need to flex the fledging systems and processes in response to the \ndemographic and economic changes in the sector. For example the proportion of the \npopulation in the 35-55 age group is growing faster than the 16-34 age group. In fact the \nnumber of 18-year-olds in the UK is predicted to fall by 15% within a decade (Times \nHigher Education, 2008). This will put greater emphasis on the recruitment of mid-career \nstudents, and will require additional support and encouragement to enable mid-career \nwomen to develop their potential in engineering (Moore and Buttner, 1997). \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to acknowledge the help of their colleagues in the development of this \nresearch.
