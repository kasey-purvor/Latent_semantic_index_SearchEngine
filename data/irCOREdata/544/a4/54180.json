INTRODUCTION \nANDPASS sigma delta modulators (SDMs) have many \nindustrial and engineering applications because many \nsystems are required to perform analog to digital conversions \non bandpass signals [1]. By using bandpass SDMs, simple and \nrelatively low precision analog components could achieve the \nobjectives. Because of this advantage, this area draws much \nattention from the researchers in the community. \nConsequently, some methods for the analysis [6], [7] and \ndesign of bandpass SDMs have been proposed [2]-[5]. \nSince the quantizer in the feedback loop of bandpass SDMs \nintroduces nonlinearities, limit cycles [6] and chaos [7] may \noccur. Some researchers utilize the nonlinear behavior to \nsuppress unwanted tones from the quantizers [9]-[11]. The \nmost common existing method is to place some unstable poles \nin the system matrices, so that chaotic behaviors will be \nexhibited in the systems, and the rich frequency spectra of \nthese chaotic output signals break down the dominant \noscillations at the outputs. However, by placing some unstable \npoles in the system matrices, the stability of the systems is \ndegraded. \nIn the practical situation, there are leakages on the \nintegrators [8]. This originates from the internal resistances of \nthe components. Even though the leakages may sometimes be \nManuscript received January 24, 2005; revised August 17, 2005.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the system \nmatrices are strictly inside the unit circle, and the system \nmatrices are actually strictly stable. \nAlthough there are some analytical results on the bandpass \nSDMs [7], most analysis is based on marginally stable system \nmatrices only. For the bandpass SDMs with strictly stable \nsystem matrices, the existing results are primarily concerned \nwith limit cycles, but not with fractal or irregular chaotic \nbehavior. In this paper, we show that fractal or irregular \nchaotic behavior may also occur. \nThe organization of the paper is as follows. The analytical \nand simulation results of bandpass SDMs with strictly stable \nsystem matrices are given in Section II. Discussion and \nconclusion are given in Section III. \nII.

According to Lemma 1, we \ncan easily see that the trajectories will converge to the set of \nfixed points { }\u2217 \u2212\u2217\u2217 110 ,,, Mxxx L , and the periodicity of the steady \nstates of the output sequence is equal to the number of fixed \npoints on the phase plane. That implies that all the fixed points \n(more than or equal to 2) cannot be in the same quadrant. For \nexample, if 2=M , then there are two fixed points on the \nphase plane and these two fixed points are located in different \nquadrants. \nThe significance of Lemma 1 is that it provides useful \ninformation for estimating the periodicity of the steady state of \noutput sequences via the phase portrait. Moreover, Lemma 1 \nprovides useful information to the SDM designers to avoid \nlimit cycle behavior. \nIt is worth noting that although the state vector is \nconverging to a periodic orbit, it never reaches these periodic \npoints. That means, the state vector is aperiodic even though \nthe output sequence is eventually periodic. This result is \ndifferent from the case when 1=r  and \u03b8  is a rational multiple \nof \u03c0 . \nMoreover, although \u2217ix , for 1,,2,1 \u2212= Mi L , depends on \n( )is , for 1,,2,1 \u2212= Mi L , it does not depend on ( )0x  directly. \nThat is, the fixed points leading to a given symbol sequence \nare not directly depended on the initial conditions. \nWhen 1=M , the output sequence will become constant and \nthere is only one single fixed point on the phase portrait. The \ntrajectory will converge to this fixed point, denoted as \u2217x . The \nsignificance of this result is that it allows SDM designers to \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n3\n3\navoid fixed point behavior. \nIt is worth noting that the state vectors of the corresponding \nlinear system will converge to ( ) BuAI 1\u2212\u2212 , which is not the \nsame as that of \u2217x . Comparing these two values, there are DC \nshifts and the DC shifts are exactly dropped at the output \nsequences, that is: \n( ) ( )\n0\n11\nkBsAIxBuAI\n\u2212\u2217\u2212 \u2212=\u2212\u2212 , (21) \nin which \n( )\n0k\nk ss =  for 0kk \u2265 . (22) \nIn addition, this phenomenon is quite different from the case \nof lowpass SDMs. In such a situation, the average output \nsequence will approximate the input values even though limit \ncycle behavior occurs. \nAlthough the nonlinearity is always activated, the rate of \nconvergence only depends on r  when the output sequence \nbecomes steady. This is because the DC terms do not affect \nthe rate of convergence. However, if we look at the transient \nresponse of the system, that is, the time duration when the \noutput sequence is not constant, the system dynamics could be \nvery complex. \nFigure 1 shows the response of the state variables of a \nbandpass SDM with \n9999.0=r , ( )158532.0cos 1 \u2212= \u2212\u03b8 , [ ]T113.0\u2212=u  and ( ) [ ]T5.000 =x .(23) \nThe state variables will converge to the same fixed value and \nthe output sequences will become constant for 2154\u2265k . \nFigure 2 shows the state trajectory of a bandpass SDM with \n99.0=r , ( )158532.0cos 1 \u2212= \u2212\u03b8 , [ ]T113.0\u2212=u  and ( ) [ ]T5.000 =x . (24) \nThe state trajectory will converge to two fixed points and the \noutput sequences are periodic with period 2  for 3\u2265k . \nAlthough Lemma 1 gives the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for the occurrence of limit cycles, it is not easy to \ncheck whether a periodic sequence is admissible or not.

That means, there exists some values of ( )1,0\u2208r  \nand { }\u03c0\u03c0\u03b8 ,0,\u2212\u2209  such that equation (29) is not satisfied.

That means, there exists some \ninitial conditions that the SDM may exhibit either elliptical \nfractal or irregular chaotic patterns. \nFigures 3a-3c show the state trajectories of a bandpass \nSDM with filter parameters 6101 \u2212\u2212=r  and \n( )158532.0cos 1 \u2212= \u2212\u03b8 , input step size [ ]T113.0\u2212=u  and \ninitial conditions ( ) [ ]T5.000 =x , ( ) [ ]T000 =x  and \n( ) [ ]T010 =x , respectively. It can be seen from the figures \nthat fractal patterns are exhibited on the phase plane and the \ntrajectories neither converge to the boundaries of the \ntrapezoids nor any fixed points in the phase portrait. \nMeasurements of the fractal dimension are estimated at 1.78 \nfor the box counting dimension, 1.75 for the information \ndimension, and 1.72 for the correlation dimension for all these \nthree initial conditions. Figures 3d-3f show the state \ntrajectories of a bandpass SDM with filter parameters \n9999.0=r  and 01.0=\u03b8 , input step size [ ]T11\n10\n\u03c0=u  and \ninitial conditions ( ) [ ]T000 =x , ( ) [ ]T010 =x  and \n( ) [ ]T200 =x , respectively. It can be seen from the figures \nthat the SDM exhibit irregular chaotic patterns on the phase \nplane. Compared to the fixed point case shown in Figure 1, \nthe value or r  is the same. Figures 3g-3i show the state \ntrajectories of a bandpass SDM with filter parameters 99.0=r  \nand 0001.0=\u03b8 , input step size [ ]T114.0=u  and initial \nconditions ( ) [ ]T000 =x , ( ) [ ]T010 =x  and ( ) [ ]T100 =x , \nrespectively. It can be seen from the figures that the SDM also \nexhibit irregular chaotic patterns on the phase plane. \nCompared to the limit cycle case shown in Figure 2, the value \nor r  is the same. Hence, even though the value of r  is close to \nthe unit cycle, different behaviors may occur. \nFigure 4 show the spectra of the corresponding output \nsequences of the above examples. It can be seen from the \nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue. \n \n \n4\n4\nfigures that there are no periodic impulses on the spectra, \nwhich illustrates that these SDMs do not exhibit limit cycle \nbehavior and do not suffer from audio tonal effects. \nAlthough there are some spikes in some of spectra of output \nsequences of the above examples, by grouping those AC \nfrequencies that producing spikes together to form a set, say \n\u2118, and defining the tonal suppressing ratio as follows: \n( )\n[ ]\n( ) \u239f\u239f\n\u239f\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2261 \u222b\n\u222b\n\u2118\u2208\n\u2118\u2212\u2208\n\u03c9\n\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\ndS\ndS\nTSR 2\n\\,\n2\n10log10\n, (31) \nit can be checked easily that the tonal suppression ratios of the \nabove SDMs are 15.9137dB, 19.2737dB, 17.7570dB, \n6.8905dB, 6.8985dB, 6.5896dB, 7.7505dB, 7.7816dB and \n7.7498dB, respectively \nSince all the simulations are carried out using MATLAB \nunder a 64 bit computer. The numerical rounding error is \ninsignificant compared to the distance between the poles of \nthe system matrices and the unit circle. For example, the \nnumerical error due to a 64 bit computer is 2 P-64P, while the \ndistance between the poles of the system matrix and the unit \ncircle is 10 P-4 P for 9999.0=r , the ratio is just 5.42\u00d710 P-16P. Hence, \nthe effect of numerical rounding error can be regarded as \ninsignificant. \nOne possible implication of the results obtained in this \npaper is that it is not necessary to place unstable poles in the \nsystem matrices of bandpass SDMs to generate signals with \nrich frequency spectra in order to suppress unwanted tones \nfrom quantizers. It is shown in this paper that fractal or \nirregular chaotic signals can be generated via system matrices \nwith strictly stable poles. Since the output sequences are \naperiodic, which consist of rich frequency spectra, the \nunwanted tones could be suppressed using these aperiodic \nsignals without the tradeoff of the stability of the systems. \nIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we found that fractal or irregular chaotic \npatterns may be exhibited in the phase portrait even though \nthe system matrices of bandpass SDMs are strictly stable. One \nimplication of the results obtained in this paper is that we can \ngenerate signals with rich frequency spectra by using strictly \nstable system matrices and hence unwanted tones generated \nby the quantizers are suppressed. Thus limit cycles may be \navoided without a tradeoff in the stability of the bandpass \nSDM. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Juan Carlos de Mateo Garc\u00eda, Ana Garc\u00eda Armada, \u201cEffects of bandpass \nsigma-delta modulation on OFDM signals,\u201d IEEE Transactions on \nConsumer Electronics, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 318-326, 1999. \n[2] Roberto Maurino and Peter Mole, \u201cA 200-MHz IF 11-bit fourth-order \nbandpass \u03a3\u0394 ADC in SiGe,\u201d IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. \n35, no. 7, pp. 959-967, 2000. \n[3] Paolo Cusinato, Fabrizio Stefani and Andrea Baschirotto, \u201cReducing the \npower consumption in high-speed \u03a3\u0394 bandpass modulators,\u201d IEEE \nTransactions on Circuits and Systems\u23afII: Analog and Digital Signal \nProcessing, vol. 48, no. 10, pp. 952-960, 2001. \n[4] Paolo Cusinato, Davide Tonietto, Fabrizio Stefani and Andrea \nBaschirotto, \u201cA 3.3-V CMOS 10.7-MHz sixth-order bandpass \u03a3\u0394 \nmodulator with 74-dB dynamic range,\u201d IEEE Journal of Solid-State \nCircuits, vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 629-638, 2001. \n[5] Weinan Gao and W.
