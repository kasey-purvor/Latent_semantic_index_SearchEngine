The most famous example\nis Condorcet\u0092s paradox. Here one individual prefers x to y to z, a second y to z\nto x, and a third z to x to y, and thus there are majorities for x against y, for y\nagainst z, and for z against x, a \u0091cycle\u0092. But it is equally well known that if individual\npreferences fall into a suitably restricted domain, majority cycles can be avoided (see\nGaertner [14] for an overview). The most famous domain restriction with this e\u00a4ect\nis Black\u0092s single-peakedness [1]. A pro\u0085le of individual preferences is single-peaked if\nthe alternatives can be ordered from \u0091left\u0092to \u0091right\u0092such that each individual has a\nmost preferred alternative with decreasing preference for other alternatives as we move\naway from it in either direction. Inada [17] showed that another condition called single-\ncavedness and interpretable as the mirror image of single-peakedness also su\u00a2 ces for\navoiding majority cycles: a pro\u0085le is single-caved if, for some left-right order of the\n\u0003This paper draws on an unpublished draft circulated in July 2006. We are grateful to Lars\nEhlers, Ashley Piggins, Ben Polak, Clemens Puppe, Alejandro Saporiti and two anonymous reviewers\nfor helpful comments and discussions. Our work was supported by a Nu\u00a2 eld Foundation New Career\nDevelopment Fellowship. Christian List\u0092s work was also supported by a Philip Leverhulme Prize.\n1\nalternatives, each individual has a least preferred alternative with increasing preference\nfor other alternatives as we move away from it in either direction. Sen [38] introduced\na very general domain condition, called triplewise value-restriction, that guarantees\nacyclical majority preferences and is implied by Black\u0092s, Inada\u0092s and other conditions;\nit therefore uni\u0085es several domain-restriction conditions, yet has a technical \u0087avour\nwithout straightforward interpretation.\nThe wealth of domain-restriction conditions for avoiding majority cycles was sup-\nplemented by another family of conditions based not on left-right orders of the al-\nternatives, but on left-right orders of the individuals. Important conditions in this\nfamily are Grandmont\u0092s intermediateness [16] and Rothstein\u0092s order restriction ([34],\n[35]) with its special case of single-crossingness (e.g., Roberts [32], Saporiti and Tohm\u00e9\n[36], Saporiti [37]). To illustrate, a pro\u0085le of individual preferences is order-restricted\nif the individuals \u0096 rather than the alternatives \u0096 can be ordered from left to right\nsuch that, for each pair of alternatives x and y, the individuals preferring x to y are\neither all to the left, or all the right, of those preferring y to x.\nIn the theory of judgment aggregation, by contrast, domain restrictions have re-\nceived much less attention (the only exception is the work on unidimensional align-\nment, e.g., List [22]). This is an important gap in the literature since, here too, major-\nity voting with unrestricted but consistent individual inputs may generate inconsistent\ncollective outputs, while on a suitably restricted domain such inconsistencies can be\navoided. As illustrated by the much-discussed discursive paradox (e.g., Pettit [31]), if\none individual judges that a, a! b and b, a second that a, but not a! b and not b,\nand a third that a! b, but not a and not b, there are majorities for a, for a! b and\nyet for not b, an inconsistency. But if no individual rejects a ! b, for example, this\nproblem can never arise.\nSurprisingly, however, despite the abundance of impossibility results generalizing\nthe discursive paradox as reviewed below, very little is known about the domains of in-\ndividual judgments on which discursive paradoxes can occur (as opposed to agendas of\npropositions susceptible to such problems, which have been extensively characterized\nin the literature). If we can \u0085nd compelling domain restrictions to ensure majority\nconsistency, this allows us to re\u0085ne and possibly ameliorate the lessons of the discur-\nsive paradox. Going beyond the standard impossibility results, which all assume an\nunrestricted domain, we can then ask: in what political and economic contexts do the\nidenti\u0085ed domain restrictions hold, so that majority voting becomes safe, and in what\ncontexts are they violated, so that majority voting becomes problematic?\nThis paper has two goals. The \u0085rst is to introduce several conditions on pro\u0085les\nof individual judgments that guarantee consistent majority judgments. These can be\ndistinguished in at least two respects: \u0085rst, in terms of whether they are based on\norders of propositions, on orders of individuals, or not on orders at all; and second, if\nthey are based on orders, in terms of whether these are \u0091global\u0092or \u0091local\u0092. We further\ndraw a distinction between product and non-product domains, which is relevant to\ngame-theoretic applications.\nThe second goal of the paper is to present a characterization result demonstrating\nthe robustness of majority voting. In analogy with May\u0092s classic characterization of\nmajority voting in binary choices [25] and Dasgupta and Maskin\u0092s theorem on the\nrobustness of majority voting in preference aggregation [2], we show that, for a very\n2\nlarge class of domains, if there exists any aggregation function that satis\u0085es some\nminimal democratic conditions including consistency of its outcomes, then majority\nvoting is the unique such function. In combination with our domain-restriction condi-\ntions, this theorem provides a powerful argument for majority voting in a broad range\nof circumstances.\nWe pursue our two goals in reverse order, beginning with the characterization of\nmajority voting, followed by the discussion of domain restrictions. We state our results\nfor the general case in which individual and collective judgments are only required to\nbe consistent; they need not be complete (i.e., they need not take a view on every\nproposition-negation pair). But we also consider the important special case of full\nrationality, i.e., the conjunction of consistency and completeness. Some of our proofs\nare given in the main text, others in the appendix.\nLet us brie\u0087y comment on how the two central distinctions underlying the domain-\nrestriction conditions discussed in this paper relate to the literature on domain restric-\ntions in preference aggregation. First, as noted, some of our conditions are based on\norders of propositions, others on orders of individuals, and yet others not on orders at\nall. The conditions based on orders of individuals generalize some of the conditions on\npreferences reviewed above, notably Grandmont\u0092s intermediateness and Rothstein\u0092s\norder restriction, and reduce to them when applied to judgments on binary ranking\npropositions that can represent preferences (such as xPy, yPz, xPz and so on). By\ncontrast, the conditions based on orders of propositions are not obviously analogous\nto any standard conditions on preferences. (An exception may be La\u00a4ond and Lain\u00e9\u0092s\n[20] condition of single-switch preferences in the di\u00a4erent context of Ostrogorski\u0092s\nparadox, where individuals\u0092most preferred positions on multiple, albeit unconnected,\nissues are restricted relative to some order of issues.) While an order of individuals can\nbe interpreted similarly in judgment and preference aggregation \u0096namely in terms of\nthe individuals\u0092positions on a normative or cognitive dimension \u0096an order of proposi-\ntions in judgment aggregation is conceptually distinct from an order of alternatives in\npreference aggregation. Propositions, unlike alternatives, are not mutually exclusive.\nIt is therefore surprising that su\u00a2 cient conditions for consistent majority judgments\ncan be given even based on orders of propositions. We also introduce a very general\ndomain-restriction condition not based on orders at all, which generalizes Sen\u0092s con-\ndition of triplewise value-restriction, and characterize the maximal domain on which\nmajority voting yields consistent collective judgments.\nSecondly, as we have also pointed out, our domain-restriction conditions based\non orders admit global and local variants. In the global case, the individuals\u0092judg-\nments on all propositions on the agenda are constrained by the same left-right order\nof propositions or individuals, whereas in the local case, that order may di\u00a4er across\nsubsets of the agenda. To relate this to the more familiar context of preference ag-\ngregation, single-peakedness and single-cavedness are global conditions, whereas the\nrestriction of these conditions to triples of alternatives yields local ones. But while in\npreference aggregation local conditions result from the restriction of global conditions\nto triples of alternatives, the picture is more general in judgment aggregation. Here\ndi\u00a4erent left-right orders may apply to di\u00a4erent subagendas, which correspond to dif-\nferent semantic \u0085elds. We give precise criteria for selecting appropriate subagendas.\nAn individual can be left-wing on a \u0091social\u0092subagenda and right-wing on an \u0091economic\u0092\none, for example.\n3\nFinally, a few remarks about the literature on judgment aggregation are due.\nThe recent \u0085eld of judgment aggregation emerged from the areas of law and politi-\ncal philosophy (e.g., Kornhauser and Sager [19] and Pettit [31]) and was formalized\nsocial-choice-theoretically by List and Pettit [23]. The literature contains several im-\npossibility results generalizing the observation that on an unrestricted domain major-\nity judgments can be logically inconsistent (e.g., List and Pettit [23] and [24], Pauly\nand van Hees [30], Dietrich [3], G\u00e4rdenfors [15], Nehring and Puppe [29], van Hees\n[39], Mongin [26], Dietrich and List [7], and Dokow and Holzman [12]). Some of\nthese impossibility results build on Nehring and Puppe\u0092s [27] results on strategy-proof\nsocial choice in the framework of property spaces. Earlier precursors include works\non abstract aggregation (Wilson [40], Rubinstein and Fishburn [33]). But so far the\nonly domain-restriction condition known to guarantee consistent majority judgments\nis List\u0092s unidimensional alignment ([21], [22]), a global non-product domain condition\nbased on orders of individuals.\n2 The model\nWe consider a group of individuals N = f1; 2;...; ng (n \u0015 2) making judgments on\nsome propositions. To represent propositions, we use Dietrich\u0092s [4] model of general\nlogics, which generalizes the approach in List and Pettit [23] and [24].\nLogic. A logic is given by a language and a notion of consistency. The language\nis a non-empty set L of sentences (called propositions) closed under negation (i.e.,\np 2 L implies :p 2 L, where : is the negation symbol). For example, in standard\npropositional logic, L contains propositions such as a, b, a^ b, a_ b, :(a! b), where\n^, _,! denote \u0091and\u0092, \u0091or\u0092, \u0091if-then\u0092, respectively. In other logics, the language may in-\nvolve additional connectives, such as modal operators (\u0091it is necessary\/possible that\u0092),\ndeontic operators (\u0091it is obligatory\/permissible that\u0092), subjunctive conditionals (\u0091if p\nwere the case, then q would be the case\u0092), or quanti\u0085ers (\u0091for all\/some\u0092). The notion\nof consistency captures the logical connections between propositions by stipulating\nthat some sets of propositions S \u0012 L are consistent (and the others inconsistent),\nsubject to some regularity axioms.1 A proposition p 2 L is a contradiction if fpg is\ninconsistent and a tautology if f:pg is inconsistent. We further say that a set S \u0012 L\nentails a proposition p 2 L if S[f:pg is inconsistent. For example, in standard logics,\nfa; a ! b; bg and fa ^ bg are consistent and fa;:ag and fa; a ! b;:bg inconsistent;\na ^ :a is a contradiction and a _ :a a tautology; and fa; a! bg entails b.\nAgenda. The agenda is the set of propositions on which judgments are to be made.\nIt is a non-empty set X \u0012 L expressible as X = fp;:p : p 2 X+g for some set\nX+ of unnegated propositions (this avoids double-negations inX). In our introductory\nexample, the agenda is X = fa;:a; a ! b;:(a ! b); b;:bg. For convenience, we\nassume that X is \u0085nite.2 As a notational convention, we cancel double-negations in\n1Self-entailment: Any pair fp;:pg \u0012 L is inconsistent. Monotonicity: Subsets of consistent sets\nS \u0012 L are consistent. Completability: ; is consistent, and each consistent set S \u0012 L has a consistent\nsuperset T \u0012 L containing a member of each pair p;:p 2 L. See Dietrich [4].\n2For in\u0085nite X, our results hold either as stated or under compactness of the logic.\n4\nfront of propositions in X.3 Further, for any Y \u0012 X, we write Y \u0006 = fp;:p : p 2 Y g\nto denote the (single-)negation closure of Y .\nJudgment sets. An individual\u0092s judgment set is the set A \u0012 X of propositions in\nthe agenda that he or she accepts (e.g., \u0091believes\u0092). A pro\u0085le is an n-tuple (A1; : : : ; An)\nof judgment sets across individuals. A judgment set is consistent if it is consistent in\nL; it is complete if it contains at least one member of each proposition-negation pair\np;:p 2 X; it is opinionated if it contains precisely one member of each proposition-\nnegation pair p;:p 2 X. (Clearly, consistency and completeness jointly imply opin-\nionation.) Our results mostly do not require completeness, in line with several works\non the aggregation of incomplete judgments (G\u00e4rdenfors [15]; Dietrich and List [9],\n[10], [11]; Dokow and Holzman [13]; List and Pettit [23]). This strengthens our possi-\nbility results as the identi\u0085ed possibilities hold on larger domains of pro\u0085les. But we\nalso consider the complete case.\nAggregation functions. A domain is a set D of pro\u0085les, interpreted as admissible\ninputs to the aggregation. An aggregation function is a function F that maps each\npro\u0085le (A1; : : : ; An) in a given domain D to a collective judgment set F (A1; : : : ; An) =\nA \u0012 X. While the literature focuses on the universal domain, which consists of all\npro\u0085les of consistent and complete judgment sets, we here focus mainly on domains\nthat are less restrictive in that they allow for incomplete judgments, but more restric-\ntive in that we impose some structural conditions. We call an aggregation function\nconsistent or complete, respectively, if it generates a consistent or complete judgment\nset for each pro\u0085le in its domain. The majority outcome on a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is\nthe judgment set\nfp 2 X : there are more individuals i 2 N with p 2 Ai than with p =2 Aig.\nThe aggregation function that generates the majority outcome on each pro\u0085le in its\ndomain D is called majority voting on D.4\nPreference aggregation as a special case. To relate our results to existing re-\nsults on preference aggregation, we must explain how preference aggregation can be\nrepresented in our model (following Dietrich and List [7] and List and Pettit [24]).\nSince preference relations are binary relations on a set of alternatives K = fx; y; :::g,\nthey can be represented as judgments on an agenda of binary ranking propositions of\nthe form xPy (\u0091x is preferable to y\u0092), where x; y 2 K. Formally, the preference agenda\nis\nXK = fxPy 2 L : x; y 2 Kg\u0006 \u0012 L,\nwhere L is a simple predicate language with the set of constants K (representing\nalternatives) and the two-place predicate P (representing strict preference), and any\nset S \u0012 L is consistent if it is consistent with the rationality conditions on strict\n3More precisely, if p 2 X is already of the form p = :q, we write :p to mean q rather than ::q.\nThis ensures that, whenever p 2 X, then :p 2 X.\n4Other widely discussed aggregation functions include dictatorships, supermajority functions, and\npremise-based or conclusion-based functions.\n5\npreferences.5 Now preference relations and opinionated judgment sets stand in a one-\nto-one correspondence:\n\u000f To any preference relation (arbitrary binary relation) \u001f on K corresponds the\nopinionated judgment set A\u001f \u0012 XK such that\nA\u001f = fxPy : x; y 2 K and x \u001f yg [ f:xPy : x; y 2 K and x 6\u001f yg.\n\u000f Conversely, to any opinionated judgment set A \u0012 XK corresponds the preference\nrelation \u001fA on K such that, for all x; y 2 K,\nx \u001fA y , xPy 2 A.\nSince we have built the rationality conditions on preferences into the notion of\nconsistency governing the logic, a preference relation \u001f is fully rational (i.e., asym-\nmetric, transitive and connected) if and only if A\u001f is consistent. Moreover, a judgment\naggregation function (for opinionated judgment sets) represents a preference aggrega-\ntion function, and majority voting as de\u0085ned above corresponds to pairwise majority\nvoting in the standard Condorcetian sense.\n3 Why majority voting?\nTo motivate our focus on majority voting, we begin by presenting a new characteriza-\ntion of it on a large class of domains. We use two democratic conditions in addition\nto the requirement of consistent collective judgment sets.\nAnonymity. For any pro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An), (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n) in the domain of F that are\npermutations of each other, F (A1; : : : ; An) = F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n):\nAcceptance\/rejection neutrality. For any pro\u0085les (A1; : : : ; An), (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n) in\nthe domain of F and any proposition p 2 X,\n[for all i 2 N , p 2 Ai , p 62 A\u0003i ] ) [p 2 F (A1; : : : ; An), p 62 F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n)].\nBoth conditions are familiar from May\u0092s classic characterization of majority voting\nin a single binary choice [25].6 Anonymity requires equal treatment of all individuals,\nand acceptance\/rejection neutrality prevents the aggregation function from favouring\nthe acceptance of a proposition over its rejection or vice versa; i.e., if the individuals\naccepting a given proposition in one pro\u0085le are the same as those rejecting it in\nanother, then the proposition must be collectively accepted in the \u0085rst pro\u0085le if and\nonly if it is collectively rejected in the second.7\n5Formally, this requires S [ Z to be consistent in the standard sense of predicate logic, where Z\nconsists of (8v1)(8v2)(v1Pv2 ! :v2Pv1) (asymmetry), (8v1)(8v2)(8v3)((v1Pv2 ^ v2Pv3) ! v1Pv3)\n(transitivity), (8v1)(8v2)(: v1 = v2 ! (v1Pv2 _ v2Pv1)) (connectedness) and, for each pair of distinct\nconstants x; y 2 K, :x = y (exclusiveness of alternatives).\n6Further, if we require consistency and completeness of individual and collective judgment sets,\nacceptance\/rejection neutrality becomes equivalent to \u0091unbiasedness\u0092(Dietrich and List [6]) and, suit-\nably translated, \u0091neutrality-within-issues\u0092(Nehring and Puppe [28]).\n7Majority voting satis\u0085es acceptance\/rejection neutrality as stated here only if n is odd, since\nrejection by exactly n=2 individuals leads to rejection but acceptance by the same n=2 individuals\ndoes not lead to acceptance. This problem can be bypassed by subtly weakening acceptance\/rejection\nneutrality, but for simplicity we set these technicalities aside.\n6\nSuppose, for the purposes of our \u0085rst theorem, that the agenda X contains no\ntautologies or contradictions.8 Call a domain D minimally rich if it includes all\nbipolar pro\u0085les, where a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is bipolar if there exists a proposition\np 2 X such that every non-empty Ai is either fpg or f:pg.\nTheorem 1 If an aggregation function F on a minimally rich domain D is consistent,\nanonymous and acceptance\/rejection neutral, then it is majority voting on D.\nThis result is surprising in at least two respects. First, unlike May\u0092s theorem, it\nrequires no monotonicity condition on the aggregation function; monotonicity follows\nfrom the other conditions. Second, unlike almost all results in the \u0085eld of judgment\naggregation, it requires no assumptions about the agenda, apart from the exclusion\nof tautologies and contradictions. Existing theorems usually need some agenda com-\nplexity assumptions, for example to derive monotonicity if it is not explicitly imposed;\nso the validity of a theorem for essentially all agendas is rather atypical.\nHow can we interpret Theorem 1? As noted in the introduction, its lesson is some-\nwhat similar to that of Dasgupta and Maskin\u0092s much-discussed result on the robust-\nness of majority voting in preference aggregation [2]. Theorem 1 shows that, for all\nminimally rich domains, if there is any consistent aggregation function that satis\u0085es\nanonymity and acceptance\/rejection neutrality, then majority voting is the unique\nsuch function. Practically all interesting and non-degenerate domains, such as those\nintroduced below, fall into this class of domains.\nTo prove Theorem 1, we \u0085rst state a lemma, proved in the appendix. Using\nstandard terminology, call aggregation function F independent if, for any pro\u0085les\n(A1; : : : ; An), (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n) in the domain of F and any proposition p 2 X,\n[for all i 2 N , p 2 Ai , p 2 A\u0003i ] ) [p 2 F (A1; : : : ; An), p 2 F (A\u00031; : : : ; A\u0003n)].\nLemma 1 Every consistent and acceptance\/rejection neutral aggregation function F\non a minimally rich domain D is independent.\nProof of Theorem 1. Consider any agenda X without tautologies, and let F and\nD be as speci\u0085ed. By Lemma 1, F is independent. For every p 2 X, let Kp be the\nset of numbers k 2 f0; :::; ng such that p 2 F (A1; :::; An) for some (and hence, by\nindependence and anonymity, every) pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) 2 D with jfi : p 2 Aigj = k.\nWe prove three claims, the second one being the key step.\nClaim 1: For all p 2 X and all k 2 f0; :::; ng, k 2 Kp , n\u0000 k =2 Kp.\n8Our other results do not require this restriction. Whether Theorem 1 continues to hold when\ntautologies and contradictions are permitted in X depends on how the de\u0085nition of bipolarity (and by\nimplication minimal richness) is extended to this case. If, in the de\u0085nition of bipolarity, we quantify\nover all propositions p 2 X, including tautologies and contradictions, minimally rich domains will\nbe forced to include pro\u0085les containing inconsistent judgment sets, which renders minimal richness\nless interpretationally plausible. But then the theorem continues to hold. If, on the other hand, we\nextend bipolarity by quantifying only over non-tautological and non-contradictory propositions p 2 X,\nthere are counterexamples to the theorem: Let X contain a tautology t, and let X have no minimal\ninconsistent subset of size three or more (so that majority voting is consistent). Let n be odd and de\u0085ne\nF on the smallest minimally rich agenda D as follows: (i) t 2 F (A1; :::; An) , jfi : t 2 Aigj < n=2;\n(ii) :t =2 F (A1; :::; An); (iii) for all p 2 Xnft;:tg, p 2 F (A1; :::; An), jfi : p 2 Aigj > n=2.\n7\nConsider any p 2 X and any k 2 f0; ::; ng. Let C \u0012 N be a coalition of size k. As\nD is minimally rich, it contains a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) for which fi 2 N : p 2 Aig = C\n(take the bipolar pro\u0085le given by Ai = fpg for i 2 C, and Ai = ? for i =2 C).\nAnalogously, there exists a pro\u0085le (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n) 2 D such that fi 2 N : p 2 A\u0003i g = NnC.\nBy acceptance\/rejection neutrality, p 2 F (A1; :::; An) , p =2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). In this\nequivalence, the left-hand-side is equivalent to k 2 Kp, and the right-hand-side to\nn\u0000 k =2 Kp. So k 2 Kp , n\u0000 k =2 Kp, as required.\nClaim 2: For all p 2 X and all k 2 f0; :::; ng, k 2 Kp ) k > n=2.\nLet p 2 X, and assume for a contradiction that Kp contains k \u0014 n=2. By Claim\n1, K:p contains exactly one of k; n \u0000 k. De\u0085ne k\u0003 as k if k 2 K:p and as n \u0000 k if\nn \u0000 k 2 K:p. As k \u0014 n=2, we have k + k\u0003 \u0014 n. So, there is a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) in\nwhich exactly k of the sets Ai are fpg, exactly k\u0003 of them are f:pg, while the rest (if\nany) of them are empty. As D is minimally rich, it contains this pro\u0085le. As k 2 Kp\nand k\u0003 2 K:p, we have p;:p 2 F (A1; :::; An), contradicting consistency.\nClaim 3: For all p 2 X and all k 2 f0; :::; ng, k 2 Kp , k > n=2 (which completes\nthe proof that F is majority voting on D).\nLet p 2 X and k 2 f0; :::; ng. By Claim 2, k 2 Kp ) k > n=2. Conversely, let\nk =2 Kp. Then n \u0000 k 2 Kp by Claim 1. So, by Claim 2, n \u0000 k > n=2, i.e. k < n=2.\nHence k 6> n=2, as required. \u0004\n4 Conditions for majority consistency based on global\norders\nWe have seen that, on every minimally rich domain, if there is any consistent aggrega-\ntion function at all that satis\u0085es anonymity and acceptance\/rejection neutrality, then\nmajority voting is the unique such function. But we already know from the discur-\nsive paradox that without any domain restriction majority voting can be inconsistent.\nMajority inconsistencies can arise on the universal domain whenever the agenda has\na minimal inconsistent subset of three or more propositions (i.e., an inconsistent sub-\nset of that size all of whose proper subsets are in turn consistent), such as the set\nfa; a ! b;:bg in the example from the introduction.9 However, we now show that\nthere exist many compelling domains on which majority voting is consistent. On these\ndomains, then, majority voting not only follows from the conditions of Theorem 1 but\nalso satis\u0085es them.10\n4.1 Conditions based on orders of propositions\nWe begin with two conditions based on global orders of the propositions. An order of\nthe propositions (in X) is a linear order \u0014 on X.11\n9For a proof of this fact under consistency alone, see Dietrich and List [9]; under full rationality,\nsee Nehring and Puppe [28].\n10For odd n; recall the earlier note about even n.\n11Thus \u0014 is re\u0087exive (x \u0014 x 8x), transitive ([x \u0014 y and y \u0014 z] ) x \u0014 z 8x; y; z), connected\n(x 6= y ) [x \u0014 y or y \u0014 x] 8x; y) and antisymmetric ([x \u0014 y and y \u0014 x]) x = y 8x; y).\n8\nSingle-plateauedness. A judgment set A is single-plateaued relative to \u0014 if\nA = fp 2 X : pleft \u0014 p \u0014 prightg for some pleft; pright 2 X,\nand a pro\u0085le is (A1; :::; An) is single-plateaued relative to \u0014 if every Ai is single-\nplateaued relative to \u0014.\nSingle-canyonedness. A judgment set A is single-canyoned relative to \u0014 if\nA = Xnfp 2 X : pleft \u0014 p \u0014 prightg for some pleft; pright 2 X,\nand a pro\u0085le is (A1; :::; An) is single-canyoned relative to \u0014 if every Ai is single-\ncanyoned relative to \u0014.12\nAn order \u0014 that renders a pro\u0085le single-plateaued or single-canyoned is called a\nstructuring order ; it need not be unique. If a pro\u0085le is single-plateaued or single-\ncanyoned relative to some \u0014, we also call it single-plateaued or single-canyoned sim-\npliciter. The order \u0014 may represent a normative or cognitive dimension on which\npropositions are located.\nInformally, single-plateauedness requires that every individual\u0092s judgment set con-\nstitute an interval (a \u0091plateau\u0092) relative to a particular left-right order of the propo-\nsitions; single-canyonedness that every individual\u0092s set of rejected propositions (i.e.,\nthe complement of his or her judgment set) form such an interval (a \u0091canyon\u0092). As an\nillustration, consider the agenda X = fa; b; a! bg\u0006, with the following interpretation:\na : \u0091CO2 emissions will increase dramatically by 2020.\u0092\nb : \u0091The frequency of hurricanes will double by 2030.\u0092\na! b : \u0091If CO2 emissions increase dramatically by 2020, then the\nfrequency of hurricanes will double by 2030.\u0092\nNow it is conceivable that individuals hold single-plateaued judgment sets on this\nagenda relative to an order of the propositions from \u0091most pessimistic\u0092to \u0091most opti-\nmistic\u0092. Proposition a can plausibly be described as more pessimistic than b, because\nof its consequences over and above the occurrence of hurricanes; b as more pessimistic\nthan a ! b, since the latter entails b only under the pessimistic circumstances of a;\nand the three unnegated propositions as more pessimistic than the three negated ones.\nTable 1 shows a pro\u0085le of single-plateaued judgment sets relative to this order. The\nlocation of each individual\u0092s plateau re\u0087ects his or her viewpoint on the issue of global\nwarming.\nPropositions (in the order) a b a! b :a :b :(a! b)\nIndividual 1 (a \u0091pessimist\u0092) X X X\nIndividual 2 (a \u0091moderate\u0092) X X X\nIndividual 3 (an \u0091optimist\u0092) X X\nTable 1: A single-plateaued pro\u0085le\n12 In the de\u0085nitions of single-plateauedness and single-canyonedness, we do not require pleft \u0014 pright,\ni.e., fp : pleft \u0014 p \u0014 prightg may be empty.\n9\nBy contrast, an individual who accepts only very pessimistic propositions and\nvery optimistic ones, but nothing in between, holds a single-canyoned judgment set\nrelative to the given order, as illustrated in Table 2. (Important special cases of single-\ncanyoned judgment sets are also those in which only \u0091extreme\u0092propositions of one kind\n\u0096i.e., only pessimistic ones or only optimistic ones \u0096are accepted.)\nPropositions (in the order) a b a! b :a :b :(a! b)\nAn individual (an \u0091extremist\u0092) X X X\nTable 2: A single-canyoned judgment set relative to the given order\nWe can easily think of other cases in which single-plateauedness is plausible. If the\nagenda contains propositions about various tax or budget policies, for instance, the\npropositions may be ordered on a classical socio-economic dimension from \u0091socialist\u0092\nto \u0091libertarian\u0092, with the individuals\u0092plateaus representing their political positions. If\nthe agenda contains propositions about science education in public schools, the order\nmay range from \u0091closest to endorsing evolutionary theory\u0092 to \u0091closest to endorsing\ncreationism\u0092, with individual plateaus representing di\u00a4erent educational viewpoints.\nBefore we state our main result about the implications of single-plateauedness and\nsingle-canyonedness, we observe that every single-canyoned pro\u0085le is single-plateaued,\nas proved in the appendix. Our proof reorders the propositions so as to \u0091glue together\u0092\nany individual\u0092s two extreme sets of propositions into a single plateau.\nRemark 1 Every single-canyoned pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets is\nsingle-plateaued.\nAs anticipated, majority voting preserves consistency on single-plateaued pro\u0085les.\nOn single-canyoned pro\u0085les, it does even more: it also preserves single-canyonedness.\nProposition 1 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets,\n(a) if (A1; :::; An) is single-plateaued, the majority outcome is consistent;\n(b) if (A1; :::; An) is single-canyoned, the majority outcome is consistent and single-\ncanyoned (relative to the same structuring order).\nProof. Consider a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An). The following notation is used in this and\nother proofs. Let A be the majority outcome. For each p 2 X, de\u0085ne Np = fi 2 N :\np 2 Aig. Whenever we consider an order \u0014 of X, let [p; q] = fr 2 X : p \u0014 r \u0014 qg, for\neach p; q 2 X. An order \u0014 is sometimes identi\u0085ed with the corresponding ascending\nlist of propositions p1:::p2k (from left to right), where 2k is the size of X (which is\neven as X is a union of pairs fp;:pg). Now let each Ai be consistent.\n(a) Assume single-plateauedness, say relative to \u0014. Among all propositions in A,\nlet p and q be, respectively, the smallest and largest proposition with respect to \u0014.\nSo A \u0012 [p; q]. As Np and Nq each contain a majority of the individuals, we have\nNp \\Nq 6= ?, and so there is an i 2 Np \\Nq. As Ai is single-plateaued and p; q 2 Ai,\nwe have [p; q] \u0012 Ai and thus A \u0012 Ai. Therefore A is consistent.\n(b) Let (A1; :::; An) be single-canyoned, say relative to \u0014. By part (a) and Remark\n1, A is consistent. As one easily checks, A is single-canyoned relative to \u0014 if and only\n10\nif, for all p 2 A, we have fq 2 X : q \u0014 pg \u0012 A or fq 2 X : q \u0015 pg \u0012 A. So it su\u00a2 ces\nto establish the right-hand side of this equivalence. Consider any p 2 A. Check that\neither (i) jfq 2 X : q \u0014 pgj \u0014 k < jfq 2 X : p \u0014 qgj or (ii) jfq 2 X : p \u0014 qgj \u0014 k <\njfq 2 X : q \u0014 pgj. We assume (i) and show that fq 2 X : q \u0014 pg \u0012 A (analogously,\n(ii) implies fq 2 X : p \u0014 qg \u0012 A). For each i 2 Np, single-canyonedness implies that\nfq 2 X : q \u0014 pg \u0012 Ai or fq 2 X : p \u0014 qg \u0012 Ai. But the latter is impossible: otherwise\njAij > k by (i), so that Ai would contain a pair p;:p, contradicting consistency. So\nwe have fq 2 X : q \u0014 pg \u0012 Ai for all i 2 Np and thus for a majority of the individuals.\nIt follows that fq 2 X : q \u0014 pg \u0012 A, as required. \u0004\n4.2 Conditions based on orders of individuals\nLet us now turn to two conditions based on global orders of the individuals. An\norder of the individuals (in N) is linear order \n on N . For any sets of individuals\nN1; N2 \u0012 N; we write N1\nN2 if i\nj for all i 2 N1 and j 2 N2.\nUnidimensional orderedness.13 A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally ordered\nrelative to \n if, for all p 2 X,\nfi 2 N : p 2 Aig = fi 2 N : ileft\ni\nirightg for some ileft; iright 2 N .\nUnidimensional alignment. (List [22]) A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally\naligned relative to \n if, for all p 2 X,\nfi 2 N : p 2 Aig\nfi 2 N : p =2 Aig or fi 2 N : p =2 Aig\nfi 2 N : p 2 Aig.\nIn analogy to the earlier de\u0085nition, an order \n that renders a pro\u0085le unidimension-\nally ordered or unidimensionally aligned is called a structuring order ; again, it need\nnot be unique. If a pro\u0085le is unidimensionally ordered or unidimensionally aligned rel-\native to some \n, we also call it unidimensionally ordered or unidimensionally aligned\nsimpliciter. Unidimensional alignment is the special case of unidimensional ordered-\nness in which, for every p 2 X, at least one of ileft; iright is the left-most or right-most\nindividual in the structuring order \n.\nRemark 2 Every unidimensionally aligned pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally\nordered.\nInformally, a pro\u0085le is unidimensionally ordered if the individuals can be ordered\nfrom left to right such that, for each proposition, the individuals accepting it are\nall adjacent to each other. A pro\u0085le is unidimensionally aligned if, in addition, the\nindividuals accepting each proposition are either all to the left or all to right of those\nrejecting it. The order of the individuals can be interpreted as re\u0087ecting their location\non some underlying normative or cognitive dimension.\nTo illustrate unidimensional orderedness and unidimensional alignment, consider\nagain the agenda X = fa; b; a! bg\u0006, this time with the following interpretation:\n13 In this de\u0085nition, we do not require ileft\niright, i.e., fi : ileft\ni\nirightg may be empty.\n11\na : \u0091A growth in government expenditure is acceptable.\u0092\nb : \u0091Defence spending should be increased.\u0092\na! b : \u0091If a growth in government expenditure is acceptable, then\ndefence spending should be increased.\u0092\nWe can imagine a political left-right order of individuals such that those on the\nleft tend to \u0085nd a growth in government expenditure acceptable (proposition a), while\nthose further to the right accept its negation (:a); moreover, those on the right tend\nto favour an increase in defence spending (proposition b), while those far enough to\nthe left accept its negation (:b); and \u0085nally, those in the middle tend to accept a\nconnection between the two (proposition a! b), while others are either uncommitted\non this matter or accept its negation (:(a ! b)). The resulting pro\u0085le satis\u0085es\nunidimensional orderedness, as shown in Table 3.\nIndividuals (in the order) 1 2 3 4 5\na X X X\nb X X X\na! b X X\n:a X X\n:b X\n:(a! b) X X\nTable 3: A unidimensionally ordered pro\u0085le\nIn this example, the pro\u0085le would become unidimensionally aligned if individual 5\naccepted rather than rejected a ! b, thereby making it the case that the individuals\naccepting each proposition are opposite those rejecting it on the given left-right order.\nTable 4 shows the required modi\u0085cation of the pro\u0085le.\nIndividuals (in the order) 1 2 3 4 5\na! b X X X\nTable 4: A unidimensionally aligned combination of judgments relative to the given\norder\nBelow we o\u00a4er a uni\u0085ed interpretation of all four domain-restriction conditions\nintroduced so far. Let us now turn to the implications of unidimensional orderedness\nand unidimensional alignment. On unidimensionally ordered pro\u0085les, majority voting\npreserves consistency, and its outcome is always a subset of the middle individual\u0092s\njudgment set (or, for even n, a subset of the intersection of the two middle individuals\u0092\njudgment sets). If the pro\u0085le is unidimensionally aligned, the majority outcome is not\njust included in that set but coincides with it.\nProposition 2 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets,\n(a) if (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally ordered, the majority outcome A is consistent\nand\nA \u0012\n\u001a\nAm if n is odd,\nAm1 \\Am2 if n is even,\nwhere m is the middle individual (if n is odd) and m1;m2 the middle pair of\nindividuals (if n is even) in any structuring order \n;\n12\n(b) (List [22]) if (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally aligned, the majority outcome is\nas stated in part (a) with \u0012 replaced by =.\nProof. Let each Ai be consistent. We use earlier proof notation.\n(a) Suppose unidimensional orderedness, say relative to \n. For all p 2 A, Np is\nsome interval [ileft; iright]. By jNpj > n=2, [ileft; iright] is long enough to contain the\nmiddle individual m (if n is odd) or the middle pair of individuals m1;m2 (if n is\neven); so p 2 Am (if n is odd) or p 2 Am1 \\Am2 (if n is even). Therefore A \u0012 Am (if n\nis odd) or A \u0012 Am1 \\Am2 (if n is even), as required. By implication, A is consistent.\n(b) See List [22], or check that, under unidimensional alignment, the converse\ninclusions Am \u0012 A (if n is odd) or Am1 \\Am2 \u0012 A (if n is even) also hold in the proof\nof (a). \u0004\n4.3 A uni\u0085ed interpretation of all four conditions\nAlthough the four domain-restriction conditions introduced up to this point are quite\ndistinct from each other, they can all be interpreted in terms of a common spatial\nframework. To introduce this framework, suppose that there exists a single left-right\naxis on which both propositions and individuals are located, as illustrated in Figure\n1 for three individuals and six propositions. Each of the four conditions can now be\nFigure 1: The positions of three individuals and six propositions\ninterpreted in terms of the particular way in which the locations of the individuals\nand the propositions constrain judgments.\nSingle-plateauedness and single-canyonedness are de\u0085ned in terms of acceptance\nregions assigned to individuals, relative to such a spatial representation. Speci\u0085cally,\na pro\u0085le is single-plateaued if each individual accepts all propositions away from his\nor her location by at most a certain distance, where the \u0091cut-o\u00a4\u0092distance may di\u00a4er\nfrom individual to individual (see Case 1 in Figure 2). If each individual\u0092s acceptance\ninterval is left-justi\u0085ed or right-justi\u0085ed (a property met only by individual 1 in the\nexample of Case 1), we obtain a special case of single-canyonedness. A general inter-\npretation of single-canyonedness is obtained by reinterpreting someone\u0092s \u0091location\u0092as\nthe position he or she deems least acceptable, rather than most acceptable, and by\nassuming that each individual rejects, rather than accepts, all propositions away from\nhis or her location by at most a certain distance (see Case 2 in Figure 2).\nUnidimensional orderedness and unidimensional alignment, on the other hand, are\nde\u0085ned in terms of intervals associated with propositions, rather than individuals. A\npro\u0085le is unidimensionally ordered if each proposition is accepted by those individuals\nwho are away from it by at most a certain distance, where the \u0091cut-o\u00a4\u0092 distance\ndepends on the proposition, rather than the individual (Case 3 in Figure 2). If each\nindividual\u0092s acceptance interval is left-justi\u0085ed or right-justi\u0085ed, the pro\u0085le becomes\nunidimensionally aligned. An alternative interpretation of unidimensional alignment\n13\nFigure 2: A uni\u0085ed spatial interpretation of the four conditions\n14\nis obtained by reinterpreting a proposition\u0092s \u0091location\u0092as constituting an acceptance\nthreshold (which may vary across propositions) and assuming that the individuals\naccepting the proposition are either all to the left or all to the right of this threshold\n(Case 4 in Figure 2). Thus the extreme positions on the left-right axis correspond\neither to clear acceptance or to clear rejection of each proposition, and the relevant\nthreshold divides the \u0091acceptance interval\u0092from the \u0091rejection interval\u0092.\nGiven the present spatial representation, each four domain-restriction conditions,\nlike single-peakedness in preference aggregation, can be interpreted as indicating a\nform of \u0091meta-agreement\u0092among the individuals on a single normative or cognitive\ndimension in terms of which their di\u00a4erent judgment sets can be rationalized, as\ndistinct from a \u0091substantive agreement\u0092on which judgment set to hold (List [21]).\n4.4 The logical relationships between the four conditions\nWe have already seen that single-canyonedness implies single-plateauedness, and that\nunidimensional alignment implies unidimensional orderedness. A natural question is\nhow the \u0085rst two conditions, which are based on orders of the propositions, are related\nto the second two, which are based on orders of the individuals. The following result\nanswers this question.14\nProposition 3 (a) Restricted to pro\u0085les of consistent judgment sets,\n\u000f unidimensional alignment implies any of the other three conditions;\n\u000f single-canyonedness implies single-plateauedness;\n\u000f there are no other pairwise implications between the four conditions.\n(b) Restricted to pro\u0085les of consistent and complete (or just of opinionated) judg-\nment sets, the four conditions are equivalent.\nProof. (a) We already know that single-canyonedness implies single-plateauedness,\nand that unidimensional alignment implies unidimensional orderedness. To show that\nunidimensional alignment implies the other conditions too, it su\u00a2 ces to establish that\nit implies single-canyonedness. We do this in the appendix, where we also show by\ncounterexamples that there are no other implications.\n(b) Let (A1; :::; An) be a pro\u0085le of consistent and complete (or just opinionated)\njudgment sets. Then each Ai contains exactly k = jXj=2 propositions. Since, by part\n(a), unidimensional alignment implies single-canyonedness, and single-canyonedness\nimplies single-plateauedness, the equivalence of all four conditions follows from the\nfollowing additional implications, which we now prove using the fact that jAij = k for\nall i. We use the notation from an earlier proof.\nSingle-plateauedness ) unidimensional orderedness. Suppose single-plateauedness,\nsay relative to the order p1:::p2k. Then, for all i, there is (using jAij = k) an index\nj(i) 2 f1; :::; 2kg such that Ai = [pj(i); pj(i)+k\u00001]. Consider an order of the individuals\ni1:::in such that j(i1) \u0014 j(i2) \u0014 ::: \u0014 j(in). To check unidimensional orderedness\n14The non-implication claims in (a) do not refer to a \u0085xed agenda X and group size n. Rather,\nfor some (in fact, most) X and n, there are pro\u0085les satisfying one condition but not the other. For\nspecial X or n, e.g., for X = fp;:pg or n = 2, all conditions hold trivially.\n15\nrelative to i1:::in, note that, for all p = pl 2 X, we have\nfi : pl 2 Aig = fi : pl 2 [pj(i); pj(i)+k\u00001]g = fi : j(i) \u0014 l < j(i) + kg\n= fi : \u0000l \u0014 \u0000j(i) < k \u0000 lg = fi : l \u0000 k < j(i) \u0014 lg,\nwhich is an interval of the order i1:::in, as required.\nUnidimensional orderedness ) unidimensional alignment. Let (A1; :::; An) be uni-\ndimensionally ordered, say relative to the order \n. To see that it is also unidimension-\nally aligned relative to the same order \n, consider any p 2 X. As each Ai contains\nexactly one member of each pair p;:p 2 X, N:p = NnNp. Further, by unidimen-\nsional orderedness, Np and N:p are (\n-)intervals. So Np and NnNp are intervals.\nHence Np\nNnNp or NnNp\nNp, as required. \u0004\n4.5 Applications to preference aggregation: order restriction and\nintermediateness\nWhat do our present domain-restriction conditions amount to when translated into\nthe classical framework of preference aggregation? As we have already noted, the con-\nditions based on orders of propositions, although formally applicable to the preference\nagenda, have no obvious standard counterparts when applied to it. They do, however,\nresemble the condition of single-switch preferences (La\u00a4ond and Lain\u00e9 [20]), which\nde\u0085nes a domain restriction in a framework in which individuals have preferences over\ncombinations of positions on multiple logically unconnected issues, such as multiple\nreferendum items. La\u00a4ond and Lain\u00e9 show that this condition, which is de\u0085ned in\nterms of an order of issues, is su\u00a2 cient for ensuring that two distinct majoritarian\nvoting procedures yield the same outcome, and thus for avoiding \u0091Ostrogorski\u0092s para-\ndox\u0092.15\nOur conditions based on orders of individuals are more closely related to standard\nconditions on preferences. We now relate unidimensional orderedness to Grandmont\u0092s\nintermediateness [16] and unidimensional alignment to Rothstein\u0092s order restriction\n([34], [35]).\nTo introduce intermediateness and order restriction, de\u0085ne a (strict) preference\nrelation be a binary relation \u001f on K (so far, we do not impose any rationality condi-\ntions on preferences), and de\u0085ne a preference pro\u0085le to be an n-tuple (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) of\nsuch relations.16\n15Ostrogorski\u0092s paradox identi\u0085es a con\u0087ict between issue-by-issue majority voting and pairwise\nmajority voting over combinations of issues. It shows that, if each individual\u0092s preferences over\ncombinations of positions on those issues are determined by their symmetrical distance from the\nindividual\u0092s most preferred combination, issue-by-issue majority voting may lead to a combination of\npositions that would lose in pairwise majority voting over combinations of issues. La\u00a4ond and Lain\u00e9\n[20] show that when individuals\u0092most preferred combinations satisfy a particular restriction based\non an ordering of issues \u0096every ideal combination is characterized by a single switch from accepted\nissues to rejected issues or vice versa \u0096then Ostrogorski\u0092s paradox cannot occur. The order of issues\nused in La\u00a4ond and Lain\u00e9\u0092s condition is analogous to the order of propositions used in the conditions\nof single-plateauedness and single-canyonedness discussed here. We thank an anonymous reviewer for\nraising this point.\n16Rothstein and Grandmont formulate their de\u0085nitions more generally for weak preference relations\n\u0017i.\n16\nIntermediateness. (Grandmont [16]) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is interme-\ndiate relative to \n if, for all x; y 2 K for all i; j; k 2 N with i\nj\nk,\n[x \u001fi y and x \u001fk y]) x \u001fj y:\nOrder restriction. (Rothstein [34], [35]) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is order\nrestricted relative to \n if, for all x; y 2 X,\nfi 2 N : x \u001fi yg\nfi 2 N : y \u001fi xg or fi 2 N : y \u001fi xg\nfi 2 N : x \u001fi yg.\nThe following is easy to check:\nRemark 3 (a) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is order restricted (relative to some\n\n) if and only if the corresponding judgment pro\u0085le (A\u001f1 ; :::; A\u001fn) is unidimen-\nsionally aligned (relative to the same \n).\n(b) An opinionated preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is intermediate (relative to some\n\n) if and only if the corresponding judgment pro\u0085le (A\u001f1 ; :::; A\u001fn) is unidimen-\nsionally ordered (relative to the same \n), where opinionation means that, for\neach i 2 N and all distinct x; y 2 K, precisely one of x \u001fi y or y \u001fi x holds.\nThe restriction to opinionated preference pro\u0085les in part (b) can be dropped under\nan alternative correspondence between preference relations and judgment sets.17\n5 Conditions for majority consistency based on local\norders\nFor many agendas, the four domain-restriction conditions discussed so far are stronger\nthan necessary for achieving majority consistency. Our goal in this section is to\nweaken them by applying them not to judgments on all propositions in X, but rather\n17Without opinionation of each \u001fi, intermediateness of (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is not equivalent to unidimen-\nsional orderedness of (A\u001f1 ; :::; A\u001fn). For all x; y 2 K, the former requires that fi 2 N : xPy 2 Aig\nbe an interval, the latter that fi 2 N : :xPy 2 Aig be an interval too. But under another correspon-\ndence between preference relations \u001f2 K\u0002K and judgment sets A \u0012 XK , intermediateness becomes\nequivalent to unidimensional orderedness (and order restriction remains equivalent to unidimensional\nalignment). On our earlier de\u0085nition, the judgment set A\u001f corresponding to a preference relation \u001f\nis always opinionated. But a judgment set A \u0012 XK need not be opinionated. In particular, if x 6\u001f y,\nthis can have two distinct interpretations: either \u0091not considering x preferable to y\u0092or \u0091considering x\nnot preferable to y\u0092, corresponding to not accepting p and accepting :p, where p is \u0091x is preferable to\ny\u0092. Our earlier de\u0085nition of A\u001f assumes the second (stronger) interpretation of x 6\u001f y, because A\u001f\ncontains :xPy if x 6\u001f y. While a preference relation \u001f\u0012 K\u0002K is ambiguous between the two interpre-\ntations, a judgment set A \u0012 XK is not. For any distinct x; y 2 K, a preference relation \u001f can display\nfour di\u00a4erent patterns: x \u001f y&y 6\u001f x, x 6\u001f y&y \u001f x, x 6\u001f y&y 6\u001f x, or x \u001f y&y \u001f x; a judgment set\nA \u0012 XK can display 24 = 16 di\u00a4erent patterns, depending on which of xPy;:xPy; yPx;:yPx are\ncontained in A. Under the weaker interpretation of x 6\u001f y, we de\u0085ne A\u001f = fxPy : x; y 2 K&x \u001f yg\n(an incomplete judgment set, unless \u001f is the total relation). Now a preference relation \u001f is fully\nrational (i.e., asymmetric, transitive and connected) if and only if A\u001f is consistent and contains a\nmember of each pair xPy; yPx 2 X with x 6= y. Intermediateness of (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) then translates into\nunidimensional orderedness of (A\u001f1 ; :::; A\u001fn).\n17\nto judgments on various subagendas of X, thereby allowing the relevant structuring\norder of individuals or propositions to vary across di\u00a4erent subagendas.\nConsider, for instance, the agenda X = fa; b; c; a! b; a! cg\u0006, where a and b are\nthe propositions \u0091CO2 emissions will increase dramatically by 2020\u0092and \u0091The frequency\nof hurricanes will double by 2030\u0092as in one of our earlier examples, and c is the propo-\nsition \u0091We should introduce a scheme of carbon taxes in which taxes on CO2 emissions\nincrease over time\u0092. Here the agenda has two semantically very di\u00a4erent non-trivial\nsubagendas, namely fa; b; a! bg\u0006 and fa; c; a! cg\u0006, one concerning environmental\naspects of global warming, the other concerning policy responses. Although some of\nour domain-restriction conditions may well be plausible when applied to each sub-\nagenda separately, it seems unduly demanding to require the same structuring order\nfor both subagendas. Instead, di\u00a4erent \u0091local\u0092 structuring orders corresponding to\ndi\u00a4erent subagendas may be warranted.\nThe move from global to local structuring orders parallels the move in preference\naggregation from single-peakedness to single-peakedness restricted to triples of alter-\nnatives. We begin by introducing the general form of our local domain restriction\nconditions; then we discuss two approaches to specifying the relevant subagendas.\n5.1 The general form of the local conditions\nA subagenda (of X) is a subset Y \u0012 X that is itself an agenda (i.e., non-empty and\nclosed under single negation). For each of our four global domain-restriction condi-\ntions, we say that a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) satis\u0085es the given condition on a subagenda\nY \u0012 X if the restricted pro\u0085le (A1 \\ Y; :::; An \\ Y ), viewed as a pro\u0085le of judgment\nsets on the agenda Y , satis\u0085es it. The relevant structuring order is then called a\nstructuring order on Y and denoted \u0014Y (if it is an order of propositions) or \nY (if it\nis an order of individuals). Whenever one of the conditions is satis\u0085ed globally, then\nit is also satis\u0085ed on every Y \u0012 X. But we now de\u0085ne a local counterpart of each\nglobal condition. Let Y be some set of subagendas.\nLocal single-plateauedness \/ single-canyonedness \/ unidimensional ordered-\nness \/ unidimensional alignment. A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) satis\u0085es the local coun-\nterpart of each global condition (with respect to a given set of subagendas Y) if it\nsatis\u0085es the global condition on every Y 2 Y.\nThis allows di\u00a4erent structuring orders \u0014Y or \nY for di\u00a4erent subpro\u0085les (A1 \\\nY; :::; An \\ Y ) (with Y 2 Y). Any implications and equivalences between our four\nglobal conditions, as stated in Proposition 3, carry over to their local counterparts\n(each de\u0085ned with respect to the same Y).18\nCorollary 1 (a) Restricted to pro\u0085les of consistent judgment sets,\n\u000f local unidimensional alignment implies any of the other three local condi-\ntions;\n18Analogously to proposition 3, the non-implication claims in (a) do not refer to a \u0085xed agenda\nX, set of subagendas Y, and group size n. Rather, for some (in fact, most) X, Y and n, there are\npro\u0085les satisfying one condition but not the other. In special cases, e.g., for Y = ;, all conditions hold\ntrivially.\n18\n\u000f local single-canyonedness implies local single-plateauedness;\n\u000f there are no other pairwise implications between the four local conditions.\n(b) Restricted to pro\u0085les of consistent and complete (or just of opinionated) judg-\nment sets, the four local conditions are equivalent.\nOur choice of subagendas in Y, with respect to which our local conditions are\nde\u0085ned, is guided by two goals. The \u0085rst is to ensure that a consistent majority\noutcome for every subagenda implies a consistent majority outcome overall (just as\nacyclicity on triples of alternatives in preference aggregation implies acyclicity overall).\nThe second is to minimize the total number and size of subagendas, so as to make\nour local domain-restriction conditions as unrestrictive as possible. Accordingly, the\nsubagendas in Y must be carefully chosen. Choosing them according to their size\n(e.g., by including in Y all subagendas of size less than some k) or according to the\nsyntactic form of propositions in them (e.g., by including in Y all subagendas whose\npropositions contain only a certain type or number of logical connectives) does not\ngenerally work.\n5.2 Selecting subagendas I: minimal inconsistent sets\nWhat set of subagendas Y should be chosen? In this subsection, we take the following\napproach. Note that a judgment set A \u0012 X is inconsistent if and only if it has a\nminimal inconsistent subset Y \u0012 X, i.e., a subset that is inconsistent but all of whose\nproper subsets are consistent. So a consistent majority outcome can be achieved by\neach of our local domain-restriction conditions where Y is de\u0085ned as\nY = fY \u0006 : Y is a minimal inconsistent subset of Xg. (1)\nProposition 4 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets,\n(a) if (A1; :::; An) satis\u0085es any of the four local conditions with respect to Y as de\u0085ned\nin (1), the majority outcome A is consistent;\n(b) in the case of local unidimensional orderedness,\nA \u0012\n\u001a [Y 2Y(AmY \\ Y ) if n is odd,\n[Y 2Y(AmY;1 \\AmY;2 \\ Y ) if n is even,\nwhere, for each Y 2 Y, mY is the middle individual (if n is odd) and mY;1;mY;2\nthe middle pair of individuals (if n is even) in any structuring order \nY on Y ;19\n(c) in the case of local unidimensional alignment, A is as stated in part (b) with \u0012\nreplaced by =.\nProof. Let Y and (A1; :::; An) be as speci\u0085ed, with majority outcome A.\n(a) To prove A\u0092s consistency, it su\u00a2 ces to prove that A has no minimal inconsistent\nsubset, hence to prove that A\\Y is consistent for all Y 2 Y. So consider any subagenda\n19The result continues to hold if every occurrence of the quanti\u0085cation Y 2 Y in part (b) is\nweakened to the quanti\u0085cation Y 2 Y\u0003, where Y\u0003 \u0012 Y is any subset of subagendas covering X, i.e.,\nwith [Y 2Y\u0003Y = X. There are many ways to cover X; trivial ones are Y\u0003 = ffp;:pg : p 2 X+g\nand Y\u0003 = Y. The representation of A becomes slim if Y\u0003 minimally covers X, i.e., covers X but no\nZ ( Y\u0003 does so too.\n19\nY 2 Y. As (A1; :::; An) is, for example, single-plateaued on Y (the proof is similar for\nsingle-canyonedness or unidimensinoal orderedness\/alignment), (A1 \\Y; :::; An \\Y ) is\nsingle-plateaued for the agenda Y and hence has a consistent majority outcome by\nProposition 1. But this majority outcome is A\\Y . So A\\Y is consistent, as required.\n(b) Assume unidimensional orderedness and let the individuals (mY )Y 2Y (if n is\nodd) or (mY;1;mY;2)Y 2Y (if n is even) be as speci\u0085ed. To show that A \u0012 [Y 2Y(AmY \\\nY ) (if n is even) or A \u0012 [Y 2Y(AmY;1\\AmY;2\\Y ) (if n is odd), it is by A = [Y 2Y(A\\Y )\nsu\u00a2 cient to show that, for all Y 2 Y, A \\ Y \u0012 AmY \\ Y (if n is even) or A \\ Y \u0012\nAmY;1\\AmY;2\\Y (if n is odd). This follows from part (a) of Proposition 2 because A\\Y\nis the majority outcome on the unidimensionally ordered pro\u0085le (A1 \\ Y; :::; An \\ Y ).\n(c) The proof is analogous to that of part (b), with each \"\u0012\" replaced by \"=\" and\nwhere we now make use of part (b) (not (a)) of Proposition 2. \u0004\n5.3 Selecting subagendas II: irreducible sets\nThe set of subagendas generated from all minimal inconsistent subsets of the agenda\ncan be large, but using this rich set has been necessary in order to guarantee major-\nity consistency on domains that allow even for incomplete individual judgment sets.\nHowever, in the important special case of individual completeness, it is enough for\nmajority consistency to impose any of our four local domain-restriction conditions\nwith a much slimmer de\u0085nition of the relevant set of subagendas. We generate these\nsubagendas not from all minimal inconsistent subsets of the agenda, but only from\nthose that are irreducible in the following sense.20 For any inconsistent set Y \u0012 X,\nwe call another inconsistent set Z \u0012 X a reduction of Y if\njZj < jY j and each p 2 ZnY is entailed by some V \u0012 Y with jY nV j > 1,\nand we call Y irreducible if it has no reduction.21 For instance, the inconsistent set\nfa; a ! b; b ! c;:cg (where a; b; c are distinct atomic propositions) is reducible to\nZ = fb; b ! c;:cg, since b is entailed by fa; a ! bg, whereas Z is irreducible. Now\nde\u0085ne\nY = fY \u0006 : Y is an irreducible subset of Xg. (2)\nThe set of subagendas de\u0085ned in (2) is a subset of the one de\u0085ned in (1) above,22\nsince every irreducible set is minimal inconsistent (a non-minimal inconsistent set\nis reducible to any of its inconsistent proper subsets). The local domain-restriction\nconditions resulting from (2) are therefore less restrictive than those resulting from\n(1) above. The following lemma is crucial; a proof is given in the appendix.\nLemma 2 Every complete and inconsistent judgment set A \u0012 X has an irreducible\nsubset.\n20Dietrich [5] has subsequently generalized this concept.\n21 In the de\u0085nition of reduction, the clause jY nV j > 1 is essential. Dropping it would render all\ninconsistent sets Y \u0012 X of size three or more reducible, namely to any pair fp;:pg with p 2 Y ; :p\nis entailed by Y nfpg.\n22 It is usually a proper subset since many minimal inconsistent subsets of the agenda, such as\nfa; a! b; b! c;:cg, are reducible.\n20\nUsing Lemma 2, we can prove our central claim: if individuals hold not only\nconsistent but also complete judgment sets, our local domain-restriction conditions\nde\u0085ned in terms of irreducible sets are enough to guarantee majority consistency. The\nassumption of individual completeness ensures an (apart from ties) complete majority\noutcome, so as to make Lemma 2 applicable in the proof.\nProposition 5 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent and complete judgment sets,\nif (A1; :::; An) satis\u0085es any (hence by corollary 1 all) of the four local conditions with\nrespect to Y as de\u0085ned in (2), the majority outcome is consistent.\nProof. We consider a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of the speci\u0085ed kind and use the earlier\nnotation.\nCase 1: n is odd. Then A is complete. So, by Lemma 2, to prove A\u0092s consistency,\nit su\u00a2 ces to prove that A has no irreducible subset, hence to prove that A \\ Y is\nconsistent for all Y 2 Y. The latter follows by an argument analogous to the one in\nthe proof of part (a) of Proposition 4.\nCase 2: n is even. Let An+1 be any complete and consistent judgment set such\nthat (A1; :::; An+1) still satis\u0085es the local condition, e.g. single-plateauedness on Y,\nnow for group size n + 1 (one might take An+1 = A1). By Case 1 the majority\noutcome on (A1; :::; An+1) is a consistent judgment set eA. Check that A \u0012 eA. So A is\nconsistent, as required. \u0004\n5.4 Applications to preference aggregation: order restriction and\nintermediateness on k-tuples of alternatives\nWhat do our local conditions look like when applied to the preference agenda? To\nanswer this question, we must identify the set of subagendas Y under each of our\ntwo criteria for selecting subagendas. A few de\u0085nitions are needed. By our de\u0085nition\nof the logic of preferences, for any distinct x; y 2 K, :xPy and yPx are equivalent.\nCall two judgment sets essentially identical if one arises from the other by (zero, one\nor more) replacements of propositions by equivalent propositions. For any distinct\nx1; :::; xk 2 K (k \u0015 1), the cyclical preferences x1 \u001f x2 \u001f ::: \u001f xk \u001f x1 can be\nrepresented by the set fx1Px2; x2Px3; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g. We call such a set, and\nany set essentially identical to it, a cycle (of length k).\nWe are now in a position to identify the minimal inconsistent subsets of the pref-\nerence agenda.\nRemark 4 The minimal inconsistent sets Y \u0012 XK are the cycles.\nProof. This follows from the de\u0085nition of the logic L for representing preferences.\nFirst, any cycle is obviously minimal inconsistent in L. Second, suppose Y \u0012 XK is\nminimal inconsistent. One can check that, by Y \u0092s inconsistency, some subset Y \u0003 \u0012 Y\nis a cycle. By minimal inconsistency, then, Y = Y \u0003. \u0004\nNext let us identify the irreducible subsets of the preference agenda. Not all cycles\nfall into this category. To illustrate, observe that any cycle of length k,\nY = fx1Px2; x2Px3; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g,\n21\nwith k \u0015 4 is reducible, e.g., to the 3-cycle fx1Px2; x2Px3; x3Px1g, as x3Px1 is\nentailed by fx3Px4; x4Px5; :::; xkPx1g.\nRemark 5 The irreducible sets Y \u0012 XK are the cycles of length 1, 2 or 3.\nProof. First, consider any cycle Y of length at most three. If Y is a 1-cycle, i.e.,\nY = fxPxg for some x 2 K, or a 2-cycle, i.e., Y = fxPy; yPxg with distinct x; y 2 K,\nthen Y is obviously irreducible. Now let Y be a 3-cycle, i.e., Y = fxPy; yPz; zPxg for\ndistinct x; y; z 2 K. Suppose, for a contradiction, that Y is reducible, say to Z \u0012 X.\nThen jZj \u0014 2. Moreover each p 2 Z is entailed by a single member of Y , i.e. by one\nof xPy; yPz; zPx. But the only proposition in X entailed by xPy is xPy (and the\nlogically equivalent :yPx), and similarly for yPz and zPx. So each p 2 Z is one of\nxPy; yPz; zPx (or one of :yPx;:zPy;:xPz). Hence Z is (essentially identical to) a\nproper subset of Y = fxPy; yPz; xPxg. So Z is consistent, a contradiction.\nSecond, suppose Y \u0012 XK is irreducible. Hence Y is minimal inconsistent. So, by\nRemark 4, Y is a cycle, hence (essentially identical to) a set of type\nfx1Px2; x2Px3; ::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g (k \u0015 1). Now k \u0014 3, as otherwise Y would be\nreducible to Z := fx1Px2; x2Px3; x3Px1g. So Y is a 1- or 2- or 3-cycle. \u0004\nBy Remark 4, the set of subagendas generated from minimal inconsistent sets is\nY = fY \u0006 : Y \u0012 XK is a cycleg,\nand by Remark 5, the set of subagendas generated from irreducible sets is the smaller\nset\nY = fY \u0006 : Y \u0012 XK is a cycle of length 1, 2 or 3g.\nJust as in the global case, we are thus able to relate local unidimensional orderedness\nand local unidimensional alignment to local versions of intermediateness and order\nrestriction. Consider the following two local conditions on preference pro\u0085les:\nIntermediateness on triples. (Grandmont [16]) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn)\nis intermediate on triples if, for every subset K 0 \u0012 K with jK 0j = 3, the preference\npro\u0085le restricted to K 0, i.e., (\u001f1 jK0 ; :::;\u001fn jK0), is intermediate (as de\u0085ned above).\nOrder restriction on triples. (Rothstein [34], [35]) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn\n) is order restricted on triples if, for every subset K 0 \u0012 K with jK 0j = 3, the preference\npro\u0085le restricted to K 0, i.e., (\u001f1 jK0 ; :::;\u001fn jK0), is order restricted (as de\u0085ned above).\nIt is easy to see that, when Y is de\u0085ned as the set of subagendas of XK generated\nfrom all cycles, unidimensional orderedness and unidimensional alignment with respect\nto Y are more demanding than intermediateness and order restriction on triples, re-\nspectively. Unlike the two triplewise conditions on preference pro\u0085les, our conditions\nrequire a structuring order of the individuals for every k-tuple of alternatives, not just\nfor every triple. As already noted, our stronger requirement is warranted when we\nwant to guarantee majority consistency even in the absence of individual complete-\nness; order restriction or intermediateness on triples do not guarantee acyclic majority\npreferences when individual incompleteness is allowed.\n22\nBut in the case of individual completeness, it su\u00a2 ces for majority consistency to\nde\u0085ne our local conditions in terms of irreducible sets, i.e., by de\u0085ning Y as the set of\nsubagendas of XK generated from all cycles of length up to three. Local unidimen-\nsional orderedness and alignment then become equivalent to the triplewise variants of\nGrandmont\u0092s and Rothstein\u0092s conditions, as shown in the appendix:\nProposition 6 A pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) of strict linear orders23 on K is intermediate\n(equivalently, order restricted) on triples if and only if the associated judgment pro\u0085le\n(A\u001f1 ; :::; A\u001fn) is locally unidimensionally ordered (equivalently, aligned) with respect\nto Y as de\u0085ned by (2).\n6 Conditions for majority consistency not based on\norders\nAlthough our domain-restriction conditions based on local orders are already much less\nrestrictive than those based on global orders, it is possible to weaken them further.\nJust as the various conditions based on orders in preference aggregation \u0096 single-\npeakedness, single-cavedness etc. \u0096 can be generalized to a weaker, but less easily\ninterpretable, condition \u0096namely Sen\u0092s triplewise value-restriction [38] \u0096so in judg-\nment aggregation the conditions based on orders can be weakened to a more abstract\ncondition, to be called value-restriction. When applied to the preference agenda, this\ncondition becomes non-trivially equivalent to Sen\u0092s condition. But despite generaliz-\ning Sen\u0092s condition, our condition is simpler to state; we thus also hope to o\u00a4er a new\nperspective on Sen\u0092s condition.\n6.1 Value-restriction\nWe state two variants of our condition, one based on minimal inconsistent sets, the\nother based on irreducible sets.\nValue-restriction. A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is value-restricted if every (non-singleton24)\nminimal inconsistent set Y \u0012 X has a two-element subset Z \u0012 Y that is not a subset\nof any Ai.\nWeak value-restriction. A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is weakly value-restricted if every\n(non-singleton) irreducible set Y \u0012 X has a two-element subset Z \u0012 Y that is not a\nsubset of any Ai.\nInformally, value-restriction re\u0087ects a particular kind of agreement: for every min-\nimal inconsistent (or irreducible in the weak case) subset of the agenda, there exists a\nparticular conjunction of two propositions in this subset that no individual endorses.\n23A strict linear order is an irre\u0087exive, transitive and connected binary relation.\n24The quali\u0085cation \u0091non-singleton\u0092in this de\u0085nition and the next is unnecessary if X contains only\ncontingent propositions, since this rules out singleton inconsistent sets.\n23\nLike our previous domain-restriction conditions, the two new conditions are each su\u00a2 -\ncient for consistent majority outcomes (the weaker condition in the important special\ncase of individual completeness).\nProposition 7 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets,\n(a) if (A1; :::; An) is value-restricted, the majority outcome is consistent;\n(b) if (A1; :::; An) is weakly value-restricted and each Ai is complete, the majority\noutcome is consistent.\nProof. Let (A1; :::; An) consist of consistent judgment sets.\n(a) Suppose (A1; :::; An) is value-restricted, but the majority outcome, A, is incon-\nsistent. Then A has a minimal inconsistent subset Y . Obviously, Y is non-singleton\n(otherwise a majority would support a contradiction). So, by value-restriction, Y has\na two-element subset Z \u0012 Y that is not a subset of any Ai. However, since Z \u0012 A,\nthere is a majority for each of the two elements of Z. Since two majorities must\noverlap, some Ai contains both of these elements, whence Z \u0012 Ai for some i 2 N , a\ncontradiction.\n(b) Suppose (A1; :::; An) is weakly value-restricted and each Ai is complete. There\nare two cases.\nCase 1: n is odd. Then A is also complete (because there cannot be majority ties).\nSuppose for a contradiction that the majority outcome, A, is inconsistent. Then A\nhas an irreducible subset Y by Proposition 2, and one can derive a contradiction\nanalogously to part (a).\nCase 2: n is even. Let An+1 be any complete and consistent judgment set such\nthat (A1; :::; An+1) is still weakly value-restricted, now for group size n+1 (of course,\nthere is such an An+1: e.g., take An+1 = A1). Let A0 be the majority outcome on\n(A1; :::; An+1). By Case 1, A0 is consistent. Check that the majority outcome on\n(A1; :::; An) is a subset of A0; hence it is consistent too, as required. \u0004\nHow general are our two value-restriction conditions? The following proposition,\nproved in the appendix, answers this question.\nProposition 8 Restricted to pro\u0085les of consistent judgment sets,\n(a) each of our four conditions based on global orders implies value-restriction;\n(b) each of our four conditions based on local orders, with respect to Y de\u0085ned in\nterms of minimal inconsistent sets, implies value-restriction;\n(c) each of our four conditions based on local orders, with respect to Y de\u0085ned in\nterms of irreducible sets, implies weak value-restriction.\n6.2 Applications to preference aggregation: triplewise\nvalue-restriction\nWe now show that, when applied to the preference agenda, our two value-restriction\nconditions surprisingly both collapse into Sen\u0092s triplewise value-restriction. Let us\nrecapitulate Sen\u0092s condition:\n24\nTriplewise value-restriction. (Sen [38]) A preference pro\u0085le (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is triple-\nwise value-restricted if, for every triple of distinct alternatives x; y; z 2 K, there is one\nalternative, say x, that is either not ranked top by any individual (no i has x \u001fi y and\nx \u001fi z), or not ranked middle by any individual (no i has y \u001fi x \u001fi z or z \u001fi x \u001fi y)\nor not ranked bottom by any individual (no i has y \u001fi x and z \u001fi x).\nAn alternative, but equivalent de\u0085nition of triplewise value-restriction requires\nthat, for each triple of alternatives, the individuals\u0092preferences be either single-peaked\nor single-caved or separable in a sense de\u0085ned by Inada [17]. (See also Elsholtz and List\n[18].) The following is the central result of this subsection, proved in the appendix.\nProposition 9 For any pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent and complete judgment sets\non the preference agenda, the following are equivalent:\n(a) (A1; :::; An) is value-restricted,\n(b) (A1; :::; An) is weakly value-restricted,\n(c) the associated preference pro\u0085le (\u001fA1 ; :::;\u001fAn) is triplewise value-restricted.\n7 Conclusion\nWe have introduced several domain-restriction conditions on pro\u0085les of individual\njudgment sets that are su\u00a2 cient for consistent majority outcomes. Some of our con-\nditions are based on global orders of either the propositions or the individuals, others\non local orders of them, and yet others not on orders at all. We have justi\u0085ed our\nfocus on majority voting by providing a new characterization result showing that,\nfor all minimally rich domains, if there is any consistent aggregation function at all\nthat satis\u0085es certain democratic conditions, then majority voting is the unique such\nfunction.\nWhile all domain-restriction conditions discussed in this paper are su\u00a2 cient for\nconsistent majority outcomes, it is useful to compare them with a necessary and\nsu\u00a2 cient condition.\nMajority-consistency. A pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) is majority-consistent if every mini-\nmal inconsistent set Y \u0012 X contains a proposition not contained in a majority of the\nAis.25\nIf (and only if) this condition is met, no minimal inconsistent set of propositions\ncan be accepted under majority voting, and thus the majority outcome is consis-\ntent. But there are some important di\u00a4erences between majority-consistency and the\nvarious conditions introduced earlier. First, unlike majority-consistency, the various\nearlier conditions are easily interpretable: they embody particular types of agreement\nwithin the group, for instance agreements on normative or cognitive dimensions under-\nlying individual judgments. Secondly, the earlier conditions are structural (as opposed\nto numerical) in the sense of depending only on whether or not certain patterns occur\n25 It is easy to see that, when the majority outcome is complete, it is enough to quantify over all\nirreducible (as opposed to all minimal inconsistent) sets Y \u0012 X.\n25\nin each judgment set in a given pro\u0085le, but not on how often those patterns occur\n(Elsholtz and List [18]). By contrast, majority-consistency is a numerical condition.\nThirdly, as we show in a moment, each of our earlier conditions can be used to de\u0085ne\nproduct domains, whereas majority-consistency cannot.\nA domain D of admissible pro\u0085les of an aggregation function (say, majority voting)\nis called a product domain if it can be expressed as\nD = D1 \u0002D2 \u0002 :::\u0002Dn,\nwhere, for each i 2 N , Di is the set of admissible judgment sets of individual i (typ-\nically, Di is the same for all i). A domain is called a non-product domain if it does\nnot admit such an expression, i.e., if the judgment set an individual can submit may\ndepend on the judgment sets submitted by others. For example, in preference aggrega-\ntion, single-peakedness and single-cavedness relativized to an antecedently \u0085xed order\nof alternatives specify product domains, while single-peakedness and single-cavedness\nsimpliciter do not.\nThe distinction between product and non-product domains is important both the-\noretically and practically. It is theoretically important in game-theoretic analyses of\naggregation problems. If we want to interpret an aggregation problem as a game,\nwhere the individuals\u0092possible inputs \u0096i.e., their preferences or judgments \u0096are their\nstrategies, then the domain of admissible pro\u0085les must be a Cartesian product of the\nstrategy sets across individuals. Standard de\u0085nitions of strategy-proofness following\nGibbard and Satterthwaite employ precisely this representation, although they can be\nmodi\u0085ed so as to accommodate non-product domains (Saporiti and Tohm\u00e9 [36]; see\nalso Dietrich and List [8]). Practically, product domains matter when an aggregation\nfunction represents a voting procedure in the ordinary sense. Here each voter must be\ngiven a list of admissible choices \u0096i.e., a set Di of admissible judgment sets (typically\nthe same across voters) \u0096 and cannot be told that certain choices are inadmissible\ndepending on the choices made by others.\nThe product domains induced by our various conditions are as follows:\n\u000f The product domain of single-plateaued\/canyoned pro\u0085les relative \u0014 (a \u0085xed\norder on X): each Di is the set of consistent judgment sets A \u0012 X that are\nsingle-plateaued\/canyoned relative to \u0014. In the case of unidimensional ordered-\nness\/alignment, the construction is slightly more elaborate.26\n\u000f The product domain of locally single-plateaued\/canyoned pro\u0085les relative to\n(\u0014Y )Y 2Y (a family of \u0085xed orders \u0014Y on the subagendas Y 2 Y): each Di is\nthe set of consistent judgment sets A \u0012 X that are single-plateaued\/canyoned\non each Y 2 Y relative to \u0014Y . Again, a more elaborate construction is possible\nfor local unidimensional orderedness\/alignment.\n\u000f The product domain of value-restricted pro\u0085les relative to (ZY )Y 2MI (a family\nof \u0085xed two-element subsets ZY \u0012 Y , with Y ranging over the setMI of minimal\ninconsistent subsets of X): each Di is the set of consistent judgment sets A \u0012 X\nthat are not supersets of any ZY .27\n26Let (A1; :::; An\u0003) be any pro\u0085le of consistent judgment sets satisfying unidimensional orderedness\nor alignment (relative to some \n), where n\u0003 \u0015 1 is any arbitrary group size (not necessarily identical to\nn). If we de\u0085ne each Di to be the set of all Ajs occurring in (A1; :::; An\u0003), then D = D1\u0002D2\u0002 :::\u0002Dn\nis a product domain of unidimensionally ordered or aligned pro\u0085les of consistent judgment sets.\n27 In the case of weak value restriction, Di can be de\u0085ned analogously, with MI replaced by the\n26\nIt can be shown that any maximal product domain D with identical Dis that\nguarantees consistent and complete majority judgments in D must be value-restricted\nrelative to some family (ZY )Y 2MI , as de\u0085ned in the last bullet point.28 In this speci\u0085c\nsense, in the case of product domains, value-restriction constitutes the most general\ndomain restriction one can give to achieve consistent majority judgments. Unlike\nvalue-restriction, the non-product domain condition of majority-consistency does not\ninduce a product domain, since it is a numerical condition, not a structural one.\nIn conclusion, Figures 3 and 4 summarize the logical relationships between all the\ndomain-restriction conditions discussed in this paper, in Figure 3 applied to pro\u0085les\nmajority-consistency\nvalue-restriction\nsingle-plateauedness\nsingle-canyonedness unidimensional orderedness\nunidimensional alignment\nlocal unidimensional alignment\nlocal unidimensional orderedness\nlocal single-canyonedness\nlocal single-plateauedness\nFigure 3: The logical relationships between the domain-restriction conditions for pro-\n\u0085les of consistent judgment sets\nmajority consistency\nvalue-restriction\nlocal unidimensional orderedness\nlocal single-plateauedness local single-canyonedness\nlocal unidimensional alignment\nunidimensional orderedness\nsingle-plateauedness single-canyonedness\nunidimensional alignment\nFigure 4: The logical relationships between the domain-restriction conditions for pro-\n\u0085les of consistent and complete judgment sets\n(smaller) set of irreducible subsets of X.\n28We show this result in follow-up work on domain restrictions that guarantee majority and super-\nmajority consistency.\n27\nof consistent individual judgment sets and in Figure 4 applied to pro\u0085les of consistent\nand complete individual judgment sets.

Consider any p 2 X and any (A1; :::; An); (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n) 2 D\nin which the same set of individuals C \u0012 N accepts p. We must show that p 2\nF (A1; :::; An) , p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). By consistency of F , if p is a contradiction, it\nbelongs to neither F (A1; :::; An) nor F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), hence p 2 F (A1; :::; An) , p 2\nF (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). Now suppose p is not a contradiction (but perhaps a tautology). The\npro\u0085le (A01; :::; A0n) given by A0i = ? for all i 2 C and A0i = fpg for all i =2 C is inD (it is\nbipolar). By acceptance\/rejection neutrality, p 2 F (A1; :::; An) , p =2 F (A01; :::; A0n).\nFurther, by acceptance\/rejection neutrality, p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n) , p =2 F (A01; :::; A0n).\nSo p 2 F (A1; :::; An), p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), as required. \u0004\nProof of Remark 1. We use the notation introduced in the proof of Proposi-\ntion 1. Consider a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent individual judgment sets, and let\n(A1; :::; An) be single-canyoned, say relative to the order p1:::p2k. We consider any Ai\nand show that Ai is single-plateaued relative to the new order pk+1:::p2kp1:::pk. By\nassumption, (i) Ai = fp1; :::pjg [ fpj0 ; :::; p2kg for some 0 \u0014 j \u0014 j0 \u0014 2k + 1. As Ai is\nconsistent, Ai contains no pair p;:p 2 X; so jAij \u0014 jXj=2 = k, whence (ii) j \u0014 k and\nj0 \u0015 k+1. Using both (i) and (ii), one can check that Ai is an interval relative to the\nnew order pk+1:::p2kp1:::pk, as required. More precisely,\nAi =\n8>><>>:\n[pj0 ; pj ] if j 6= 0 and j0 6= 2k + 1,\n[p1; pj ] if j 6= 0 and j0 = 2k + 1,\n[pj0 ; p2k] if j = 0 and j0 6= 2k + 1,\n? if j = 0 and j0 = 2k + 1. \u0004\n30\nSupplementary parts of the proof of Proposition 3. We use the notation from\nthe earlier proofs as well as the abbreviations SP (single-plateauedness), SC (single-\ncanyonedness), UO (unidimensional orderedness) and UA (unidimensional alignment).\nUA =) SC.

In the example pro\u0085le of Table 5, it is\nobvious that (A1; :::; An) is SC relative to p1:::p2k: A1 = Xn[p4; p6], A2 = A3 = A4 =\nXn[p3; p5] and A4 = A5 = Xn[p2; p4].\nFor the general proof of SC, consider any Ah (1 \u0014 h \u0014 n) and let us show that\nAh is SC relative to \u0014. It su\u00a2 ces to prove that, for all p 2 X, either [p1; p] \u0012 Ah\nor [p; p2k] \u0012 Ah. Consider any p 2 X. By UA, either Np = f1; :::; kg for some k, or\nNp = fk; :::; ng for some k \u0015 2. By construction of the order p1:::p2k, in the \u0085rst case\n[p1; p] \u0012 Ah and in the second case [p; p2k] \u0012 Ah, as required.\nSP 6) SC. Consider an agenda X and a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) consisting of pairwise\ndisjoint consistent judgment sets, at least three of which are non-empty. The pro\u0085le\nis SP, namely relative to an order starting with the propositions in A1; followed by\nthose in A2; ..., and ends with those in An. But the pro\u0085le is not SC: if it were SC, say\nrelative to an order \u0014, then each non-empty Ai would contain an extreme (i.e., left-\nor right-most) proposition; so that, as at least three Ais are non-empty but there are\nonly two extreme propositions, the Ais would not be pairwise disjoint, a contradiction.\nSC 6) UO. Consider an agenda X, group N and pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) such that\nn = 4, A1 = fp; p0; q; q0g; A2 = fp; p0g, A3 = fq; q0g, A4 = fp; qg, where p; p0; q; q0 2 X\n31\nare pairwise distinct. This pro\u0085le is SC: consider an order \u0014 such that p < p0 < ::: <\nq0 < q (where \u0091:::\u0092contains all remaining propositions). Suppose for a contradiction\nUO holds, say relative to an order i1:::in. As Np0 = f1; 2g, individuals 1 and 2 are\nneighbours (in i1:::in). As Nq0 = f1; 3g, 1 and 3 are neighbours. So 1 is \u0091surrounded\u0092\nby 2 and 3, i.e., i1:::in contains the sublist 213 or 312; suppose it contains the sublist\n213 (the proof continues analogously for the sublist 312). Also, as Np = f1; 2; 4g, 4\nis a neighbour of 1 or of 2; since 4 cannot be a neighbour of 1 (which is surrounded\nby 2 and 3), it is a neighbour of 2. So i1:::in contains the sublist 4213. Finally, as\nNq = f1; 3; 4g, 4 is a neighbour of 1 or 3, which is not the case since i1:::in contains\nthe sublist 4213.\nSC 6) UA. This follows from SC 6) UO by UO ) UA.\nSP 6) UO.

We show that B is irreducible.\nSuppose for a contradiction that B is reducible to C \u0012 X. We will de\u0085ne an incon-\nsistent subset of A smaller than B, in contradiction to the choice of B. By jCj < jBj\nand the choice of B, we have C 6\u0012 A. So there is a p 2 CnA. Since A is complete, we\nhave :p 2 A. As C is a reduction of B, there is a subset B\u0003 \u0012 B with jBnB\u0003j \u0015 2\nand B\u0003 ` p. Now B\u0003 [ f:pg is an inconsistent subset of A smaller than B:\n- B\u0003 [ f:pg is a subset of A by B\u0003 \u0012 B \u0012 A and :p 2 A;\n- B\u0003 [ f:pg is inconsistent by B\u0003 ` p;\n- jB\u0003 [ f:pgj \u0014 jB\u0003j+ 1 = jBj \u0000 jBnB\u0003j+ 1 \u0014 jBj \u0000 2 + 1 < jBj. \u0004\nProof of Proposition 6. Let (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) be as speci\u0085ed, and denote by (A1; :::; An)\nthe corresponding judgment pro\u0085le, whose judgment sets Ai (= A\u001fi) are complete\nand consistent as each \u001fi is also fully rational. For all i and all distinct x; y 2 K, x \u001fi\ny , y 6\u001fi x; so that for (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) intermediateness on triples is indeed equivalent\nto order restriction on triples. Moreover, as each Ai is complete and consistent, for\n(A1; :::; An) local unidimensional orderedness with respect to Y is indeed equivalent\nto local unidimensional alignment with respect to Y (see corollary 1). So it remains\n32\nto show that (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is intermediate on triples if and only if (A1; :::; An) is locally\nunidimensionally ordered (with respect to Y).\nTo prove the latter, recall that the irreducible sets are, by Remark 5, the cycles of\nlength 1 or 2 or 3, i.e. the subagendas essentially identical to a subagenda of type\nfxPxg\u0006 or fxPy; yPxg\u0006 (x 6= y) or fxPy; yPz; zPxg\u0006 (x; y; z distinct): (3)\nSo, using that unidimensional orderedness on a subagenda is equivalent to unidimen-\nsional orderedness on any essentially identical subagenda, (A1; :::; An) is locally uni-\ndimensionally ordered if and only if it is unidimensionally ordered on any subagenda\nof one of the three types in (3). Unidimensional orderedness holds trivially on sub-\nagendas of the \u0085rst type fxPxg\u0006; and similarly for subagendas of type fxPy; yPxg\u0006\n(x 6= y): consider an order of N beginning with the individuals i with x \u001fi y, and\nfollowed by the individuals i with y \u001fi x. So local unidimensional orderedness is\nequivalent to unidimensional orderedness on each of the subagendas\nfxPy; yPz; zPxg\u0006 (x; y; z 2 K distinct).\nBut this is equivalent to intermediateness of (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn), as one easily checks (using\nthat, for distinct x; y 2 K, :xPy 2 Ai , yPx 2 Ai for all Ai). \u0004\nThe proof of Proposition 8 requires a lemma:\nLemma 3 Let S 6= ? be a set of subsets I \u0012 N that are each intervals relative to\nsome \u0085xed linear order on N . If the elements of S are pairwise non-disjoint (i.e.,\nI \\ J 6= ? for all I; J 2 S), they are all non-disjoint (i.e., \\I2SI 6= ?).\nProof. Let S be as de\u0085ned in the lemma. Note that S must be \u0085nite. So a proof\nby induction on the size of S is possible. More precisely, we prove by induction that\n\\i2SI = [maxi2I min I;min I2S max I] 6= ?.\nFirst let S have size 1, say S = fIg. The claim then holds, since \\J2SJ = I =\n[min I;max I], which is non-empty because it can be written as I \\ I, a non-empty set\nby pairwise non-disjointness.\nNow suppose the claim holds for sets of a size k (\u0015 1), and consider a set S of size\nk+1, say S = S0 [fJg where S0 has size k. We have \\I2SI = J \\ (\\I2S0I), where by\ninduction hypothesis, \\I2S0I = [maxI2S0 min I;minI2S0 max I] 6= ?. So\n\\I2SI = J \\ [max\nI2S0\nmin I;min\nI2S0\nmax I]:\nThis set obviously equals [maxI2S min I;minI2S max I]. To complete the proof, sup-\npose for a contradiction that this interval is empty. The intersection of two intervals\n(here, of J and [maxI2S0 min I;minI2S0 max I]) can only be empty if the largest ele-\nment of one of the intervals is smaller than the smallest element of the other interval.\nSo either minI2S0 max I < minJ or max J < maxI2S0 min I. In the \u0085rst case, there\nis an I 2 S0 such that max I < minJ , so that I \\ J = ?. In the second case, there\nis an I 2 S0 with max J < min I, so that again I \\ J = ?. So in any case pairwise\nnon-disjointness is violated, a contradiction. \u0004\n33\nProof of Proposition 8. We prove part (a). Parts (b) and (c) follow analogously.\nConsider a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An) of consistent judgment sets. By Remarks 1 and 2, it\nsu\u00a2 ces to show that (i) single-plateauedness implies value-restriction and that (ii)\nunidimensional orderedness implies value-restriction.\n(i) Suppose (A1; :::; An) is single-plateaued, say relative to the order \u0014. To show\nvalue-restriction, consider any non-singleton minimal inconsistent set Y . We must\nspecify a two-element subset of Y not contained in any Ai. De\u0085ne it as consisting\nof the smallest element p and the largest element q of Y (relative to the order \u0014).\nAs required, no Ai can contain both p and q: otherwise it would include the entire\ninterval from p to q (by single-plateauedness), hence include the inconsistent set Y , a\ncontradiction.\n(ii) Suppose, for a contradiction, that (A1; :::; An) is unidimensionally ordered but\nnot value-restricted. Let Y be a non-singleton minimal inconsistent set for which\nvalue-restriction is violated. Let S be the set ffi 2 N : p 2 Aig : p 2 Y g. By\nunidimensional orderedness, S consists of intervals (relative to a structuring order \n).\nFurther, these intervals are pairwise non-disjoint: otherwise there would be p; q 2 Y\nsuch that fi 2 N : p 2 Aig \\ fi 2 N : q 2 Aig = ?, so that no Ai contains both p\nand q, whence value-restriction would not be violated for Y . So, by Lemma 3, S has\na non-empty intersection. In other words, some Ai contains all p 2 Y . But then Ai is\ninconsistent, a contradiction. \u0004\nProof of Proposition 9. Let (A1; :::; An) be as speci\u0085ed, and denote by (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn)\nthe corresponding preference pro\u0085le. We \u0085rst show that (b) is equivalent to (c), and\nthen that (a) is equivalent to (b).\n(c) =) (b). First suppose (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) is triplewise value-restricted. Consider\nany non-singleton irreducible Y \u0012 XK . By Remark 5, Y is a cycle of length 2 or\n3. If Y has length 2, hence is a binary inconsistent set, we can take Z = Y , and by\nindividual consistency no Ai includes Z. Now let Y be a 3-cycle, hence essentially\nidentical to a set of the form fxPy; yPz; zPxg for distinct x; y; y 2 K. By triplewise\nvalue-restriction, some of x; y; z is in (\u001f1; :::;\u001fn) either never ranked between, or never\nabove, or never below, the two other alternatives. We go through all nine cases:\n- if x is never ranked between y and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fzPx; xPyg;\n- if y is never ranked between x and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fxPy; yPzg;\n- if z is never ranked between x and y, no Ai is a superset of Z = fyPz; zPxg;\n- if x is never ranked above y and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fxPy; yPzg;\n- if y is never ranked above x and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fyPz; zPxg;\n- if z is never ranked above x and y, no Ai is a superset of Z = fzPx; xPyg;\n- if x is never ranked below y and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fyPz; zPxg;\n- if y is never ranked below x and z, no Ai is a superset of Z = fzPx; xPyg;\n- if z is never ranked below x and y, no Ai is a superset of Z = fxPy; yPzg.\n(b) =) (c). Now let (A1; :::; An) be weakly value-restricted. To show that (\u001f1\n; :::;\u001fn) is triplewise value-restricted, consider any distinct alternatives x; y; z 2 K. By\nRemark 5, the sets Y = fxPy; yPz; zPxg and Y 0 = fzPy; yPx; xPzg are irreducible\nand non-singleton. So, by weak value-restriction, Y has a two-element subset Z not\nincluded in any Ai, and similarly Y 0 has a two-element subset Z 0 not included in any\n34\nAi. Assume Z = fxPy; yPzg (the proof is analogous for other binary subsets of Y ).\nSince each Ai is neither a superset of Z nor one of Z 0, we can conclude the following:\n- if Z 0 = fzPy; yPxg, then no Ai ranks y between x and z;\n- if Z 0 = fyPx; xPzg, then no Ai ranks z below x and y;\n- if Z 0 = fxPz; zPyg, then no Ai ranks x above y and z.\nSo, whatever Z 0 is, we have triplewise value-restriction.\n(a) =) (b). Trivial, since irreducible sets are minimal inconsistent.\n(b) =) (a). Suppose (A1; :::; An) is weakly value-restricted. To show value-\nrestriction, consider any non-singleton minimal inconsistent set Y \u0012 XK . By Remark\n4, Y is a cycle of some length k, hence is essentially identical to \u0096we may assume\nidentical to \u0096a set of type\nY = fx1Px2; x2Px3; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g, with distinct x1; :::; xk 2 K\nfor some k \u0015 2. We show by induction on the size k of Y that Y has a two-element\nsubset Z that is not included in any Ai.\nFirst let k = 2 or k = 3. Then Y is by Remark 5 irreducible, hence has by weak\nvalue restriction a two-element subset Z not included in any Ai.\nNow suppose k \u0015 4, and let the claim hold for sets of size less than k. Consider the\nnon-singleton irreducible sets Y 0 = fx1Px2; x2Px3; x3Px1g and\nY 00 = fx1Px3; x3Px4; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g. By induction hypothesis,\n(*) Y 0 has a binary subset Z 0 not included in any Ai; and\n(**) Y 00 has a binary subset Z 00 not included in any Ai.\nWe distinguish three cases.\nCase 1: x3Px1 =2 Z 0. Then Z 0 \u0012 Y , and we may put Z = Z 0.\nCase 2: x1Px3 =2 Z 00. Then Z 00 \u0012 Y , and we may put Z = Z 00.\nCase 3: x3Px1 2 Z 0 and x1Px3 2 Z 00. Then Z 0 = fp; x3Px1g for some p 2\nfx1Px2; x2Px3g, and Z 00 = fq; x1Px3g for some q 2 fx3Px4; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g.\nDe\u0085ne Z = fp; qg. Obviously, Z is a two-element subset of Y . Further, no Ai includes\nZ:\n- if p 2 Ai, then x3Px1 =2 Ai (as Ai does not include Z 0), so x1Px3 2 Ai (as Ai is\ncomplete and consistent), and so q =2 Ai (as Ai does not include Z 00);\n- if q 2 Ai, then x1Px3 =2 Ai (as Ai does not include Z 00), so x3Px1 2 Ai (as Ai is\ncomplete and consistent), and so p =2 Ai (as Ai does not include Z 0). \u0004\n35\n"}
