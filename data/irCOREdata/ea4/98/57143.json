A 11 \nregional-scale lateral culmination wall forms the southern boundary of the Cassley Culmination in 12 \nMoine rocks in the Caledonides of Sutherland, Northern Scotland. This culmination wall is part of 13 \nthe Oykel Transverse Zone (OTZ), a kilometre-scale shear zone characterised by constrictional 14 \nfinite strain fabrics aligned sub-parallel to the regional WNW-directed thrust transport direction. 15 \nMain phase folds and fabrics in the transverse zone hanging-wall are folded by main phase folds 16 \nand fabrics in the footwall, thus recording foreland-propagating ductile deformation. South of the 17 \nCassley Culmination, shortening occurred  uniformly, without development of discrete subsidiary 18 \nthrusts; distributed deformation (fold development) alternated with localised thrusting within the 19 \nculmination. The classic ESE-plunging mullions at Oykel Bridge are an integral part of the OTZ 20 \nand were generated by constriction aligned sub-parallel to the transport direction. Constriction is 21 \nattributed to differential, transtensional movement across the OTZ during culmination 22 \ndevelopment. Subsequent formation of the underlying Assynt Culmination further accentuated 23 \nupward-bulging of the Cassley Culmination, amplifying the lateral change across the transverse 24 \nzone. The OTZ aligns with a pronounced gravity gradient on the south-western side of the Lairg 25 \ngravity low. Interpretive modelling relates this gradient to a buried basement ramp that possibly 26 \ncontrolled the location of the transverse zone. 27 \n(end of abstract, 214 words) 28 \n29 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 2 - \nThe structural geometries of fold-and-thrust belts commonly show significant lateral 30 \nvariation, often related to the development of duplexes and associated culmination 31 \nstructures (e.g. Elliott & Johnson 1980; Boyer & Elliott 1982; Butler 1987; Butler et 32 \nal. 2007). Sharp lateral changes occur across transverse zones, which can comprise 33 \nlateral culmination walls, strike-slip faults, and other structures that link thrusts 34 \nlaterally (Thomas 1990). Transverse zones in thrust systems are commonly understood 35 \nto be coincident with, and caused by, deeper seated pre-existing structural features, 36 \nsuch as faults that displace the basement-cover interface (Thomas 1990; Paulsen & 37 \nMarshak 1999). Such lateral discontinuities, and their associated transverse zones, are 38 \nmainly documented in the brittle, thin-skinned parts of fold-and-thrust belts (e.g. 39 \nPaulsen & Marshak 1999; Krabbendam & Leslie this volume). In this paper, we 40 \ndescribe a regional-scale ductile transverse zone developed in association with a 41 \nductile thrust stack in Moine rocks now arranged structurally above the more brittle or 42 \nbrittle-ductile structures of the classic Moine Thrust Belt in NW Scotland (Fig. 1). 43 \nThis Oykel Transverse Zone comprises a  large-scale lateral culmination wall, marking 44 \nthe southern termination of a number of separate thrust sheets. The Cassley 45 \nCulmination comprises a bulge at the southern limit of these thrust sheets and lies 46 \nstructurally above the brittle Assynt Culmination (Fig. 1, 2).  47 \n The Oykel Transverse Zone (OTZ) is marked by a c. 5 km wide and c. 20 km 48 \nlong panel of SW-dipping, highly deformed lithologies, striking broadly perpendicular 49 \nto the overall trend of the thrust front, but approximately parallel to the overall 50 \ntransport direction (Fig. 2). The OTZ contains the classical Oykel Bridge mullion 51 \nstructures (Wilson 1953), and here we seek to link the development of these mullions 52 \nto the kinematic evolution of the OTZ. Furthermore, the OTZ is coincident with the 53 \nSW margin of the \u2018Lairg low\u2019 in the regional gravity field, one of the most 54 \nconspicuous gravitational features in the Northern Highlands. In this paper we present 55 \nnew gravity modelling which implies that the location of the OTZ was strongly 56 \ninfluenced by a prominent buried ramp, or series of steps, in the basement\/cover 57 \ninterface. We propose a kinematic model for the OTZ that links development of the 58 \narchitecture of the OTZ, and of the Moine Nappe and the Cassley Culmination, with 59 \nthe compartmentalisation of structure in the underlying Moine Thrust Belt in Assynt 60 \n(Krabbendam and Leslie this volume). 61 \n 62 \n 63 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 3 - \nGeological setting 64 \nBaltica-Laurentia collision during the Scandian (Silurian) phase of the Caledonian 65 \nOrogeny is expressed in the Northern Highlands of Scotland as a crustal-scale WNW-66 \nvergent fold-and-thrust belt. In northern Scotland, this Caledonian deformation 67 \nculminated in development of the Moine Thrust Belt; this classic and well-studied belt 68 \ndefines the external part of the Caledonian Orogen. The Moine Thrust Belt records 69 \npredominantly brittle, overall WNW-directed, thin-skinned thrust transport estimated 70 \nof the order of 50\u201380 km (e.g. Lapworth 1885; Peach et al. 1907; Soper & Wilkinson 71 \n1975; Elliott & Johnson 1980; McClay & Coward 1981; Butler 1982; Butler et al. 72 \n2007; Krabbendam & Leslie this volume). The Moine Thrust defines the base of the 73 \nMoine Nappe sensu lato (British Geological Survey 1997, 2002) and marks the  74 \nboundary between the external and internal parts of the Caledonian Orogen in 75 \nnorthern Scotland (Fig. 1). In Sutherland, in the more internal parts, the Naver Thrust 76 \ndefines the base of the overlying Naver Nappe; farther south the Sgurr Beag Thrust 77 \noccupies a similar structural level at the base of the Sgurr Beag Nappe. Deformation 78 \nwithin this internal part of the belt is thick-skinned and ductile, and generally occurred 79 \nunder greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphic conditions (see Strachan et al. 80 \n2002 for overview). 81 \n The early Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Moine Supergroup 82 \ndominate the geology of the Northern Highlands. These Moine rocks are interfolded 83 \nand intersliced with late Archaean \u2018Lewisianoid\u2019 orthogneisses regarded as fragments 84 \nof the basement onto which the Moine sedimentary protoliths were deposited 85 \nunconformably (Ramsay 1957; Holdsworth 1989; Holdsworth et al. 1994, 2001; 86 \nFriend et al. 2008). Though disrupted by a number of ductile thrusts (Barr et al. 1986; 87 \nHoldsworth 1989), the Moine Supergroup has been divided into three groups, the 88 \nstructurally and stratigraphically lowest of which is the Morar Group (Johnstone et al. 89 \n1969; Soper et al. 1998; Fig. 1). The younger Glenfinnan and Loch Eil groups mainly 90 \noccur structurally above the ductile Sgurr Beag Thrust (Holdsworth et al. 1994; 91 \nStrachan et al. 2002). Relevant here is that along its entire 200 km length, the hanging 92 \nwall of the Moine Thrust (i.e. the Moine Nappe sensu lato) is composed only of 93 \nMorar Group rocks or their associated basement gneisses. 94 \nThe Morar Group was originally deposited as several kilometres thick package 95 \nof siliciclastic strata and now occurs as dominantly psammitic rocks with subsidiary 96 \nlayers of pelite and semipelite. Sedimentary structures are commonly (but not 97 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 4 - \nubiquitously) deformed, obscured or obliterated by regional metamorphism, 98 \nespecially in pelitic and semipelitic lithologies. North of Glen Oykel (Fig. 2), the 99 \nMorar Group stratigraphy is dominated by the Altnaharra Formation and composed of 100 \nrather uniform psammite with subsidiary layers of pelitic, semipelitic and pebbly 101 \nrocks. Bed thickness typically varies from 20 cm to over 300 cm and sedimentary 102 \nstructures such as cross-bedding, nested cross-beds, and soft-sediment deformation 103 \nare common and suggest deposition in a braid-plain fluvial setting. An original 104 \nstratigraphical thickness in excess of 3 km can be demonstrated and a correlation with 105 \nthe Torridon Group in the Foreland has been suggested (Krabbendam et al. 2008).  106 \n 107 \nTiming of events 108 \nThe present-day disposition of rocks in the Northern Highlands is that of a foreland-109 \npropagating fold-and-thrust-belt system (Barr et al. 1986; Holdsworth et al. 2001, 110 \n2006, 2007), mainly the result of Caledonian (Scandian) orogenesis. However, the 111 \nMoine rocks have experienced a number of much-debated tectonometamorphic 112 \nevents, namely an extensional event at c. 870 Ma followed by Knoydartian (820\u2013740 113 \nMa), Grampian (470\u2013460 Ma) and finally by Scandian (430\u2013400 Ma) orogenic events 114 \n(see review in Strachan et al. 2002).  115 \nMovement along the Moine Thrust at the western boundary of the Caledonian 116 \nOrogen is regarded as Silurian (Scandian) in age (van Breemen et al. 1979; Johnson et 117 \nal. 1985; Kelley, 1988; Freeman et al. 1998; Dallmeyer et al. 2001). Isotopic dating of 118 \nsyn-tectonic granites suggests that Scandian deformation was also widespread within 119 \nthe Moine and Naver nappes in Sutherland (Kinny et al. 2003). Knoydartian 120 \ntectonometamorphic ages have been recorded mainly in the south (van Breemen et al. 121 \n1974, 1978; Piasecki & van Breemen 1983; Rogers et al. 1998; Vance et al. 1998), 122 \nwhere it is thought that the main movement along the Sgurr Beag Thrust is 123 \nKnoydartian (Tanner & Evans 2003). Grampian effects are most evident in east 124 \nSutherland and eastern Inverness-shire (Kinny et al. 1999; Emery et al. in prep.). 125 \nThese regional variations in the intensity and spatial extent of orogenic events mean 126 \nthat correlation of structures is complex and problematical (Hobbs et al. 1976; Forster 127 \n& Lister 2008). For example, \u2018regional S2\u2019 in the Morar Group of west Sutherland  128 \nappears to be Silurian (Scandian) in age, whilst \u2018regional S2\u2019 in the Glenfinnan and 129 \nLoch Eil groups appears to be Ordovician (Grampian) in age (Rogers et al. 2001; 130 \nKinny et al. 2003; Emery 2005). Further complexity is introduced because any 131 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 5 - \nindividual deformation event may well be developed diachronously. In this paper we 132 \nwill show that there is no such thing as a \u2018regional S2 fabric\u2019 in the Cassley 133 \nCulmination; we will demonstrate that in Glen Oykel the dominant \u2018S2\u2019 in one nappe 134 \nis clearly overprinted by the dominant \u2018S2\u2019 in a structurally lower (i.e. younger 135 \nformed) nappe in a foreland-propagating system. 136 \n 137 \nThe Cassley Culmination - overview 138 \nThe structure of the central part of the Moine outcrop has received little or no 139 \nattention since the rather cursory primary survey (Read et al. 1926). The exception to 140 \nthis has been the studies of the now classic mullion structures at Oykel Bridge (Figs. 141 \n3, 4a) described by Clough (in Peach et al. 1912), Read et al. (1926) and Wilson 142 \n(1953).  143 \nNew mapping in connection with a British Geological Survey (BGS) resurvey 144 \nof the region has identified a structural culmination in the hanging wall of the Moine 145 \nThrust and SE of the classic Assynt Culmination; this structure is defined here as the 146 \nCassley Culmination (Figs. 1, 2). The Moine Thrust acts locally as the floor thrust to 147 \nthe culmination and the Achness Thrust is regarded as the roof thrust to the 148 \nculmination; the Ben Hope Thrust lies within the culmination, between the Achness 149 \nand Moine thrusts (Figs. 2, 3). The transport direction on each thrust is top-to-the-150 \nWNW, parallel to a locally well-developed quartz mineral and pebble elongation 151 \nlineation. The Ben Hope and Achness thrusts have broadly arcuate outcrop traces and 152 \nconverge with the Moine Thrust at the SE corner of the Assynt Culmination (point A 153 \non Fig. 2), thus delineating the limit of the Cassley Culmination in the south and SW 154 \n(Figs. 2, 3). 155 \n  The southern lateral termination (culmination wall) of the Cassley Culmination 156 \nis well-defined; the hanging wall of the Achness Thrust is marked by a km-scale thick, 157 \nstrongly deformed, planar zone of southward-dipping flaggy psammite (Figs. 2, 3). 158 \nThis zone contains a prominent belt of mullion structures which includes the classic 159 \nOykel Bridge locality (Wilson 1953, Fig. 4a). These mullions plunge SE, sub-parallel 160 \nto the regional transport direction. Southwest of Loch Shin, the individual nappes 161 \ncomprise distinctive lithological packages and structural geometries; each are 162 \ndescribed in more detail below. The fabric overprinting relationships in the vicinity of 163 \nthe Achness Thrust demonstrate clearly that the age of the dominant schistosity (\u2018S2\u2019) 164 \nis different in each nappe. It is not appropriate therefore to simply refer to an \u2018S2\u2019 165 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 6 - \nwithout reference to the structural domain in which that fabric has been recorded 166 \n(Hobbs et al. 1976; Forster & Lister 2008); \u2018S2\u2019 has no single meaning across the 167 \nculmination.

The arrow tracks the foreland-propagating deformation history. 175 \n 176 \nStructure and lithologies of the Achness Nappe  177 \nThe Achness Thrust forms the roof thrust to the Cassley Culmination (Fig. 2). The 178 \ntrace of the Achness Thrust is well constrained in the south, less so in the east and 179 \nnorth. At its type section at the Achness Falls, the Achness Thrust dips c. 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 to 180 \nthe south (Fig. 6). North of the falls, and structurally below the thrust, thick-bedded 181 \npsammitic rocks of the Ben Hope Nappe are folded by open to close, north-south 182 \ntrending F2BH folds (Cassley folds \u2013 see below); strata young overall to the west or 183 \nsouth. Cross-bedding, younging towards the thrust, occurs as close as 50 m 184 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 7 - \nstructurally beneath the trace of the Achness Thrust. Closer to the Achness Thrust, 185 \npsammite becomes highly-deformed and sub-mylonitic. The Achness Thrust marks 186 \nthe contact between these psammites and a sheet of mylonitic Lewisianoid basement 187 \ngneiss, c. 200 m thick (Fig. 6). The gneiss is bounded to the south by an intermittent 188 \nlayer of semipelitic schist up to 20 m thick, overlain by psammite which is locally 189 \ngritty to pebbly. These units probably represent lowermost Morar Group strata 190 \noccurring immediately above the inferred unconformity with the basement gneiss. 191 \nSome 250 m south of this contact, cross-bedding youngs to the south, away from the 192 \nAchness Thrust.  193 \n The Achness Thrust has not been studied in detail east and north of Achness 194 \nFalls. Its location may be marked by a series of Lewisianoid slivers, associated with 195 \nphyllonitic gneiss or psammite (Peacock 1975) that occur in the east. It is thought 196 \nmost likely that north of these inliers it trends northwestward across the poorly 197 \nexposed ground south of Loch Shin, to link with the Ben Hope Thrust in the vicinity 198 \nof Loch Merkland (Fig 2). According to this interpretation, the Airde of Shin 199 \nbasement inlier lies in the hanging wall of the Achness Thrust (Fig. 2). This inlier 200 \noccurs in the core of a major tight anticline (the Loch Shin Anticline, LSA on Fig. 2). 201 \nIn contrast to the rather cylindrical F2BH\/AC folds observed elsewhere across the 202 \nCassley Culmination, the Loch Shin Anticline is a curvilinear non-cylindrical fold, 203 \nwhich, at Airde of Shin is locally sideways-closing and inferred to plunge to the ESE, 204 \nparallel to the regional L2 stretching and mineral lineation (Strachan & Holdsworth 205 \n1988). The Loch Shin Anticline is tentatively correlated with the gently-plunging, 206 \ncylindroidal Ben Hee Anticline farther north (Fig 2; and see Cheer et al. this volume). 207 \nAn alternative interpretation is that the Achness Thrust links with the Dherue Thrust 208 \n~30 km north of Loch Shin (Fig 2). This solution cannot be precluded completely 209 \ngiven the sparse exposure around Loch Shin, but is thought less likely. 210 \n No Lewisianoid inliers occur in the hanging wall of the Achness Thrust 211 \ntowards the west, and within the lateral termination of the Cassley Culmination; 212 \npsammite is emplaced on psammite (Figs. 3, 6). However, the character of the 213 \npsammite on either side is quite different. The psammite structurally below the 214 \nAchness Thrust (i.e. in the Ben Hope Nappe) is generally thick-bedded and massive. 215 \nFabric development is poor and related to the west-vergent km-scale \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019, 216 \n(F2BH); in many outcrops the fabric is at high angles to bedding (Fig. 5, and see Ben 217 \nHope Nappe section below). Only a small distance below the thrust (c. 100\u2013200 m), 218 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 8 - \nthe strike of the strata, and of the \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019, is at a high angle to the trace of the 219 \nAchness Thrust (Figs. 6 & 7). In contrast, to the south and structurally above the 220 \nAchness Thrust, psammite strata are thin-bedded (possibly caused by deformation, see 221 \nbelow), with a well-developed bedding-parallel biotite-defined foliation S2AC, (Table 222 \n1); both S0 and S2AC are sub-parallel to the Achness Thrust, i.e. ~E-W striking and 223 \nsouth-dipping at 30\u201350\u00b0 (Fig. 5). Using these criteria, the Achness Thrust can be 224 \ntraced from the Achness Falls, via the Tutim Burn to the Allt Rugaidh Bheag section 225 \n(Fig. 7). Farther west, intermittent exposure suggests that the Achness Thrust joins the 226 \nMoine Thrust at point A on Fig. 2. 227 \n 228 \nStructure and lithologies of the Ben Hope Nappe 229 \nThe Ben Hope Thrust is a strongly localised ductile tectonic break that separates grey 230 \nflaggy psammite in its footwall from pale grey to white, commonly siliceous, 231 \npsammite with minor grey semipelite in its hanging wall. Foliation is intense and 232 \nsubparallel to the thrust in its immediate vicinity. In limited exposure in Gleann na 233 \nMuic (point C on Fig. 2) the thrust is associated with siliceous mylonite and in Glen 234 \nOykel with dark grey phyllonite c. 6 m thick (point D on Fig. 2). This thrust can be 235 \ntraced across the Cassley Culmination to connect with the trace of the Ben Hope 236 \nThrust farther north (Cheer et al. this volume) and south to its termination downwards 237 \nagainst the Moine Thrust at the SE corner of the Assynt Culmination (near point A, on 238 \nFig. 2). 239 \n The Ben Hope Nappe is dominated by thick-bedded psammite with subsidiary 240 \nlayers of semipelite. In low strain zones (highlighted on Fig. 2), cross-bedding, 241 \nchannels, slump-folds and water escape structures are locally well preserved (e.g. 242 \nCheer 2006; Krabbendam et al. 2008, Fig. 4c); overall, the strata young towards the 243 \nwest and the succession is >3 km thick. The internal structure of the Ben Hope Nappe 244 \nis dominated by a stack of kilometre-scale, west-facing and west-verging, open to 245 \nclose folds, termed here the \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019, (F2BH, Table 1; see also Cheer et al. this 246 \nvolume). The low-strain zones referred to above typically occur in the steep to vertical 247 \nshort limbs of these large-scale folds (see sections b & c on Fig. 2). The folds trend 248 \nroughly NNW-SSE (Fig. 5), have shallow plunging axes and are sub-cylindrical over 249 \nmany kilometres. The major Cassley Anticline marks a major change eastward to 250 \nmoderately E-dipping strata in the footwall of the Achness Thrust (CA on Fig 2); a 251 \nwell-developed planar schistosity is sub-parallel to bedding in the eastern long limb of 252 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 9 - \nthis structure. In contrast, and in low strain areas on the steeply-dipping short limb of 253 \nthe fold, psammitic rocks typically show a complete lack of any tectonic fabric; a 254 \nplanar schistosity (S2BH) and associated lineation (L2BH) are locally present in gritty 255 \nunits. A well-developed fabric is typically only observed in semipelitic units (which 256 \nbecome more prevalent higher up in the sequence towards the west); this is a variably 257 \nintense crenulation fabric that deforms an earlier bedding-parallel schistosity (S1BH).  258 \n The chronology of fabric development in the Ben Hope Nappe is readily 259 \ndetermined in the Allt Rugaidh Mhor stream section (Figs. 3, 7). Strata young to the 260 \nSW, decimetre-scale trough cross-bedding is well-preserved locally. The western 1.5 261 \nkm of the section is a steep limb to a major anticline trace at point D on Fig. 7. East of 262 \nthis point the rocks are arranged in a \u2018staircase\u2019 of SW-vergent decametre-scale folds 263 \n(F2BH), with gently-dipping limbs and short, steep SW-dipping limbs. Axial surfaces 264 \nare gently NE-dipping and axes plunge gently to the SE. These are typical Cassley 265 \nfolds. 266 \n The steeply dipping psammitic rocks in the western part of this section 267 \nconsistently show a well-developed sub-horizontal grain-shape fabric S2BH (quartz + 268 \nfeldspar + mica) at high angle to S0 in places and parallel to the axial surfaces of the 269 \nF2BH folds. An intersection lineation (L2BH) is well-developed on S0. Where mullions 270 \nare developed close to the confluence with the Oykel River, and at An Stuc and 271 \nKnock Craggie (Figs. 2, 3, 4b), they are seen to be always parallel to the S0\/S2BH 272 \nintersection lineation at outcrop (see also section on Mullions).  273 \n An S1BH (bedding sub-parallel) planar schistosity is observed locally in cm-274 \nthick semipelite layers; this is strongly crenulated by a mica-defined S2BH, which is 275 \ncontinuous with S2BH shape fabric in the adjacent psammite. In metre-scale layers of 276 \nsemipelite, an intense mica-defined crenulation fabric (S3BH) locally overprints and 277 \ntransposes the earlier gently-inclined S2BH fabric into a new steeply-dipping, spaced 278 \nanastomosing muscovite-biotite schistosity. Relicts of the older S2BH planar 279 \nschistosity are preserved in S3BH microlithons. This superimposed fabric has only 280 \nbeen observed in the short steeply-dipping limbs of the SW-vergent F2BH folds 281 \nsuggesting that orientation and scale of the incompetent layer is critical.  282 \n 283 \nStructure and lithologies of the Moine Nappe (s.s.) 284 \nMoine rocks between the Moine and Ben Hope thrusts in Glen Oykel and Gleann na 285 \nMuic (Fig. 2) comprise alternations of dark, to mid-grey micaceous psammite layers 286 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 10 - \n(5\u201310 cm thick, only rarely as much as 20 cm thick) and subsidiary 2\u20135 cm thick 287 \nlayers of dark grey semipelite. Bedding locally appears to be right-way-up and the 288 \nlack of any large-scale folding suggests that the succession is grossly right-way-up 289 \nand c. 2 km thick in Gleann na Muic (Fig. 2), thinning south-westward to 290 \napproximately 1 km in upper Glen Oykel. Farther to the south, the nappe terminates at 291 \nthe southeast corner of the Assynt culmination, (see Figs. 2, 3).  292 \nLocal preservation of sedimentary grading suggests that this lithology may 293 \nhave originated as thinly-bedded layers of sandstone to siltstone. In the absence of 294 \nreliable strain markers it is presently uncertain whether this layering is an original 295 \nfeature, or a result of subsequent strain \u2013 or a combination thereof. In sharp contrast, 296 \nabundant large-scale cross-bedding in Morar Group rocks occurring at the same broad 297 \nstructural level north of Loch Shin (Fig. 2, Krabbendam et al. 2008) implies either 298 \nrapid lateral facies changes or dramatic variations in ductile strain.  299 \n In the Moine Nappe in Glen Oykel, a penetrative planar to weakly 300 \nanastomosing foliation (SM, Table 1) is defined by alignment of biotite and muscovite 301 \nsub-parallel to lithological layering. No earlier tectonic fabric has been definitely 302 \nobserved in these rocks. The geometry of the S0\/SM relationship is consistently west-303 \nvergent; a faint quartz mineral lineation (LM) plunges to the ESE on SM surfaces (Figs. 304 \n3, 5). In upper Glen Oykel, a transition from the \u2018graded\u2019 metasandstones with well-305 \ndeveloped planar SM into splintery quartzofeldspathic mylonite (with SmylM) occurs 306 \nstructurally downwards towards the Moine Thrust. A c. 100\u2013200 m thick layer of 307 \npsammitic mylonite occurs in the immediate hanging-wall of the Moine Thrust. 308 \nWithin these mylonites, stretching lineations, and the axes of tight to isoclinal minor 309 \nfolds (often doubly closing) of the mylonitic foliation, plunge ESE. The mylonites are 310 \nunderlain by the Moine Thrust.  311 \n 312 \nRelationship between fabric development and folding in different nappes 313 \nIn the Allt Rugaidh Bheag section (Fig. 7), the flaggy bedding and bedding\u2013parallel 314 \nfoliation structurally above the Achness Thrust is folded by open to close NNW-SSE 315 \ntrending folds (F3AC). These folds can be traced north and structurally below the 316 \nAchness Thrust, into the Ben Hope Nappe as the \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019. In other words, the 317 \ndominant structures in the structurally lower Ben Hope Nappe (F2BH \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019) 318 \nfold the Achness Thrust and the penetrative S2AC fabric in the structurally higher 319 \nAchness Nappe (c.f. Table 1). This critical and consistent observation shows that the 320 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 11 - \ndominant deformation below the Achness Thrust postdates and overprints the 321 \npenetrative fabric its hanging wall. The Cassley Anticline may also have this general 322 \nrelationship, folding the Achness Thrust in the SE corner of the Cassley Culmination 323 \n(Fig. 2). 324 \n 325 \nTermination of the Cassley Culmination 326 \nThe trace of the Achness Thrust defines the southern limit to the Cassley Culmination. 327 \nThe hanging wall of the Achness Thrust in Glen Oykel comprises ESE-striking 328 \npsammitic rocks which dip 30\u201360\u00b0 to the SSW (Figs. 3, 5). This panel is some 5\u20137 329 \nkm wide at outcrop and c. 20 km in length, traced from the Assynt Culmination to the 330 \nKyle of Sutherland (Fig. 1). It forms the southern lateral culmination wall of the 331 \nCassley Culmination. The strata in this panel are generally thin-bedded and flaggy (5\u2013332 \n50 cm, Fig. 4d); massive thick-bedded (e.g. > 100 cm) strata, as seen in the Ben Hope 333 \nNappe, are never observed. Right-way-up cross-bedding has been observed locally 334 \nand youngs south away from the Achness Thrust (e.g. Figs 3, 8). A fabric defined by 335 \nbiotite (S2AC) is usually well-developed and is commonly (sub)parallel to bedding; 336 \nwhere (small) angles exist between the biotite-defined S2AC and bedding, the 337 \nintersection lineation (L2AC) plunges 10\u201330\u00b0 to the SE (Fig. 5). Whilst it is clear that 338 \nthe psammite in this domain has undergone significant strain, it is difficult to estimate 339 \nto what extent the \u2018flagginess\u2019 is wholly or partially an effect of thinning of an 340 \noriginal thick-bedded sequence, or whether the strata were originally thinner-bedded 341 \nthan those at Glen Cassley.  342 \n The km-scale F2AC Einig fold pair forms a prominent feature of this zone, 343 \naligned at a high angle to the Cassley folds in the Ben Hope Nappe structurally 344 \nbeneath (Figs. 7, 8). The major antiformal hinge is located at the confluence of the 345 \nrivers Oykel and Einig (point E on Fig. 3), with the complimentary synformal closure 346 \nlocated at point F (Fig. 3); the fold pair can be traced westwards to Allt Tarsuin (point 347 \nG on Fig. 3). The fold pair is tight, asymmetrical, SSW-vergent and downward-348 \nfacing; fold axes plunge uniformly to the SE (Fig. 8, c.f. Figs. 6, 7). The biotite-349 \ndefined S2AC fabric is axial planar to the fold pair.  350 \n 351 \nMullions 352 \nThe origin and tectonic significance of the mullion structures at Oykel Bridge were 353 \ncontroversial for many years (Clough in Peach et al. 1912; Read 1931; Bailey 1935; 354 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 12 - \nPhillips 1937; Wilson 1953). According to Clough, the mullions (or \u2018rodding\u2019) were 355 \nformed by \u2018pressures from four sides in opposite pairs, leaving constituents to squeeze 356 \nout ...\u2019 effectively describing a constrictional strain ellipsoid. In the Geological 357 \nSurvey Memoir, Read et al. (1926) thought that the mullions were formed by two 358 \nseparate deformation phases, the first being contraction in a NE\u2013SW direction, the 359 \nsecond extension along a NW\u2013SE axis. The latter phase was clearly linked to 360 \nmovement along the Moine Thrust; \u201cthe stretching is in harmony with the dip of the 361 \nMoine Thrust [\u2026.] and maybe regarded as an obvious accompaniment of the thrust-362 \nmovement towards the northwest\u201d. 363 \nConspicuous columnar mullion structures are spectacularly displayed in a 400 364 \nm long section along the gorge of the River Oykel between the new road bridge [NC 365 \n3855 0090] and Oykel Falls [NC 3825 0115], (Figs. 4a, 8 and see Wilson 1953). 366 \nAlthough the mullions are best developed and exposed near Oykel Bridge (on the 367 \nnorthern long limb of the Einig fold pair), our mapping has shown that these features 368 \noccur over a much wider area stretching from Knock Craggie and Salachy (Oykel 369 \nRiver) in the NW to Langwell in the SE, in a zone several km wide (Figs. 2, 3). 370 \nMullions occur both in the Achness Nappe, and in the SW corner of the Ben Hope 371 \nNappe, so that the \u2018mullion zone\u2019 crosses the Achness Thrust near the confluence of 372 \nOykel River and the Allt Rugaidh Bheag (Figs. 3, 7). In the Achness Nappe, mullions 373 \nare absent or only weakly developed on the inverted NE-SW trending common limb 374 \nof the Einig fold pair. Mullions are also observed (albeit less well developed) on the 375 \nsouthern long limb of the Einig fold pair. WNW-striking strata are clearly more 376 \nsensitive to mullion development than the NE-SW striking strata. No mullions have 377 \nbeen observed below the Ben Hope Thrust.  378 \n The mullions are best developed in relatively thick-bedded (2\u201350 cm) 379 \nsiliceous psammites. Of all the mullion types originally described by Wilson (1953), 380 \n\u2018fold mullions\u2019 are best developed and are, as stated here, concavo-convex in section. 381 \nThe convex part is typically a decimetre-scale fold closure. The outer surface is often 382 \nformed by a thin micaceous sheath and may be either concordant or sharply 383 \ndiscordant with the internal layering (see Fig. 3 in Wilson 1953). However, (slightly 384 \ndeformed) cross bedding may often be seen when mullions are viewed down-plunge 385 \nin profile, hence the observed discordance of internal lamination with the folded S0 386 \nsurface. The mullions are strongly linear and consistently SE-plunging (130\u00b0N\/40\u00b0) 387 \nalong the entire \u2018mullion zone\u2019 (Figs. 3, 5). The very consistent orientations and 388 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 13 - \nlinearity of the mullions suggest a significant component of SE-oriented stretching; 389 \nhowever, it appears that the complementary contraction was limited, possibly less 390 \nthan 10\u201320%, to judge by the geometry of preserved cross-bedding. 391 \n 392 \nRelation of mullions and other structures 393 \nIn terms of the relations between the mullions and other structures, the following 394 \nobservations are pertinent: 395 \n1) Within the Ben Hope Nappe, the mullions are only developed in its extreme 396 \nSW corner, e.g. in the lower parts of the Allt Rugaidh Mhor section, along the 397 \nOykel River near Salachy. Here the mullions (LM) are invariably exactly 398 \nparallel to the intersection (L2BH) of the main fabric (S2BH) and S0 at outcrop; 399 \nthis intersection lineation is related to the main phase of folding within the 400 \nBen Hope Nappe (F2BH \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019).  401 \n2) In the Achness Nappe, a well-developed L2AC mineral elongation alignment 402 \ncommonly lies sub-parallel to the mullions (LM) and a weak axial planar 403 \nschistosity is associated with an intersection lineation that likewise plunges 404 \nsub-parallel to the mullions. Where a micaceous sheath is developed, it also 405 \ncommonly carries a weak superimposed S4AC crenulation fabric, oblique to 406 \nthe mullion axis. There are abundant examples of small and meso-scale 407 \nreclined, tight to open, asymmetrical F2AC folds in the Oykel River gorge 408 \nsection, mullion lineations are aligned approximately parallel to these fold 409 \nhinge lines and to the larger scale Einig Folds fold pair (Fig. 8).  410 \n3) Locally however, (e.g. west of Oykel Bridge, Fig. 8), a clear angle (30\u00b0) can 411 \nbe seen between the L2AC lineation and the mullions, with the mullions (LM) 412 \nfolding the lineation.  413 \n4) The mullion zone crosses the Achness Thrust, suggesting that mullion 414 \ndevelopment post-dated the formation of this thrust (Figs. 3, 7).  415 \n5) No mullions have been observed below the Ben Hope Thrust.  416 \nAll of the above suggest that the mullions overprint and post-date the main 417 \ndeformation within the Achness Nappe and the formation of the Achness Thrust, but 418 \nthat mullion development was broadly coeval with the formation of the \u2018Cassley 419 \nFolds\u2019 within the Ben Hope Nappe. The absence of mullions between the Moine 420 \nThrust and the Ben Hope Thrust may be a rheological response to lithology; 421 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 14 - \nalternatively, it is possible that mullion development ceased after the development of 422 \nthe Ben Hope Thrust (see discussion below).  423 \n 424 \nGeophysical data: the Lairg gravity low 425 \nExamination of the regional gravity field in Sutherland provides key insight into the 426 \nsub-surface structure beneath the Cassley Culmination. The gravity field southeast of 427 \nthe Assynt culmination is dominated by the Lairg gravity low (Fig. 9). The centre of 428 \nthe low coincides approximately with the location of the Caledonian Grudie Granite 429 \nPluton (see Figs. 1, 9) and from there Bouguer gravity anomaly values increase 430 \nlinearly northwestwards to the outcrop of the Moine Thrust. The SW margin of the 431 \nlow is defined by a clear gravity lineament which extends southeastwards from the 432 \nOykel Bridge area towards the Kyle of Sutherland. North of Loch Shin the north-433 \neastern side of the Lairg low crosses the area underlain by the Naver Thrust. In the 434 \nNNW, the anomaly merges with a NW-trending gravity low centred over Laxfordian 435 \ngranitic rocks on the northern side of the Laxford Shear Zone (\u2018Ben Stack Line\u2019, Bott 436 \net al. 1972, see Fig. 1). 437 \n Hipkin & Hussain (1983) ruled out the possibility that the Lairg gravity low is 438 \ncaused by a concealed Caledonian granite on the basis of its shape, which is quite 439 \ndistinct from that of the anomalies observed over other granites of this age, and the 440 \nfact that a magnetic anomaly associated with the Grudie Granite has only a limited 441 \nareal extent. Citing continuity with the gravity feature to the NNW, Hipkin & Hussain 442 \n(1983) postulated that the Lairg gravity low may be explained by an extension of the 443 \nlow density Laxfordian rocks beneath the exposed Moine sequence. Butler &  Coward 444 \n(1984) preferred an interpretation involving thickening of the Moine rocks around 445 \nLairg linked to the transfer of sheets of Lewisian basement to the Assynt area. The 446 \nmodelling of Rollin (in press) also invokes a thickening of the Moine sequence. 447 \nFurther modelling described below investigates the source of the Lairg gravity low, 448 \nand the implications of the relationship between its southern margin and the OTZ. 449 \n 450 \nRock densities 451 \nThe estimated average density of the psammitic rocks of the Morar Group exposed 452 \nwithin the study area is 2.65 Mg\/m3, based on laboratory measurements on 59 453 \nsamples (BGS, unpublished data). There are no determinations of the density of the 454 \npelitic rocks in the study area and relatively few elsewhere in the Northern Highlands. 455 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 15 - \nA clear correlation between local gravity highs and pelitic outcrops indicates that the 456 \nlatter have a higher density than the psammitic rocks (Hipkin & Hussain 1983); an 457 \naverage density of 2.75 Mg\/m3 has been assumed for the present modelling, based on 458 \nthe limited samples available. Bott et al. (1972) detected density variations within the 459 \nexposed Lewisian basement in the vicinity of the Laxford Shear Zone but adopted a 460 \n\u2018background\u2019 value of 2.78 Mg\/m3 in the Assynt area, a value which has also been 461 \nassumed in the modelling described here.  462 \n 463 \nGravity modelling 464 \nModels have been constructed along two profiles across the Lairg gravity low (Figs. 465 \n9, 10). Profile 1 trends NW\u2013SE and provides the clearest insights into the cause of the 466 \nlow while the NE\u2013SW oriented profile 2 investigates the gravity gradient on its 467 \nsouthwestern side and its relationship with the OTZ. The modelling employed 2.5-468 \ndimensional methods in which geological units are represented by bodies with 469 \nconstant polygonal cross-section and finite strike extent. A general northward and 470 \nwestward increase in the regional gravity field has been removed prior to modelling 471 \nlocal structure. A background field was assumed which increases westwards from 4 472 \nmGal to 24 mGal along profile 1 and northwards from 11 mGal to 22 mGal on line 2. 473 \nThis field is not well-constrained and is a significant source of uncertainty in the 474 \nmodelling. 475 \nAlong profile 1, the gravity field decreases linearly south-eastwards from the 476 \noutcrop of the Moine Thrust (Fig. 10). The gradient is reproduced by the thickening of 477 \nrelatively low density Morar Group rocks above this thrust without the need to invoke 478 \ndensity variations within the underlying basement. The Grudie Granite (see Fig. 1) 479 \nmakes a small contribution to the gravity low in its central part, as a slight steepening 480 \nof the gravity gradients around the granite is more readily explained by the density 481 \ncontrast between it and its host rocks than by features at basement depth. Limited 482 \nsampling does indicate such a contrast, at least with the monzogranite component of 483 \nthe intrusion (Rollin, in press). The Migdale Granite Pluton (see Fig. 1) has a very 484 \nsmall gravity effect, implying a limited depth extent and\/or a density similar to that of 485 \nthe surrounding Moine rocks. As there is no evidence for an increase in density of 486 \nMorar Group rocks between the Grudie and Migdale granites, the southeastward rise 487 \nin gravity field in this area is attributed to a relatively thick wedge (or wedges) of 488 \nLewisian basement above the Achness Thrust.

The steepening gravity gradient 490 \nSE of the Migdale Granite Pluton is attributed to a combination of shallow basement 491 \nand the presence of relatively dense pelitic rocks of the Glenfinnan Group above the 492 \nSgurr Beag Thrust. 493 \n The model for profile 1 suggests that 5\u20136 km of Moine rocks are present 494 \nbeneath the centre of the Lairg gravity low, and this was used as the starting point for 495 \nmodelling the depth to basement beneath profile 2 (Fig. 10). The northern end of this 496 \nmodel is schematic; migmatitic Moine rocks with a relatively high density are present 497 \nat surface, but the proportion of such rocks and the overall Moine thickness are poorly 498 \nconstrained. A distinct southward thickening of the Morar Group psammites has been 499 \nmodelled between kilometre 20 and 30 along this profile. This segment spans the 500 \nLoch Shin Line (Watson 1984), which in turn lies on the projection of the Laxford 501 \nShear Zone (Fig. 1), so may reflect the influence of a pre-existing basement structure. 502 \nThere is, however, no obvious signature in the gravity profile to suggest a discrete 503 \nzone of low-density Laxfordian granite in the basement.   504 \n The local gravity minimum associated with the Grudie Granite Pluton lies 505 \nbetween about kilometre 27 and 37 on profile 2, but the steep gravity gradient that 506 \nforms the SW margin of the more extensive Lairg gravity low is centred at kilometre 507 \n50 (Fig. 10). This linear feature appears to be enhanced by the near-surface density 508 \ncontrast between Moine psammite the north and a more heterolithic sequence to the 509 \nsouth that includes the Vaich Pelite Formation (Fig. 1). Outcrops of the Vaich Pelite 510 \nFormation can be correlated with residual gravity highs and the amplitude of the 511 \ngradient is reduced where pelitic rocks are absent at surface south of the lineament. It 512 \nis, however, difficult to explain all the gravity variation simply in terms of lithological 513 \ncontrast within the Moine. The profile 2 model (Fig. 10) includes about 40% of pelitic 514 \nmaterial at the southern end of the profile, which even if an overestimate when 515 \ncompared with the relative outcrop proportions, still requires an overall thinning of 516 \nthe Moine rocks. Sensitivity trials in which the proportion and density of pelitic rocks 517 \nin this sequence are varied between reasonable bounds indicate that it is necessary for 518 \nthe model to retain a significant southward shallowing of the basement in this area. 519 \nComparison with the structural architecture of the geological model clearly shows that 520 \nthe southern termination of the Cassley Culmination is positioned over the buried 521 \nbasement ramp (or series of steps) indicated by the geophysical model (Fig. 10, 522 \nprofile 2). 523 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 17 - \nDiscussion  524 \nThe Oykel Transverse Zone 525 \nThe contrast between the numerous branching thrusts which make up the Cassley 526 \n(ductile) and Assynt (brittle-ductile) culminations and the regions of folded, but not 527 \ninternally thrust, Moine rocks SW of Strath Oykel delineates a mid-crustal transfer  528 \nzone, named here the Oykel Transverse Zone (OTZ). The pattern of thrusting 529 \nobserved here has been reproduced in analogue modelling of transverse zones in 530 \ndeforming thrust wedges (Liu Huiqi et al. 1991; Malaveille et al. 1991; Calassou et 531 \nal. 1993), in particular the observation that where basement is vertically offset, lateral 532 \nthrust ramps have their roots in the basal discontinuity. These ramps will then be 533 \nsteepened as thrusting continues to excavate new thrust packages during foreland-534 \npropagation (Thomas 1990; Calassou et al. 1993; Paulsen and Marschak 1999). 535 \nSimilarly, as the Cassley Culmination grew, the structurally higher, older nappes were 536 \ndeformed in response to the emergence, towards the west-northwest, of lower and 537 \nyounger nappes.  538 \nThomas (1990) reviewed potential pre-thrust templates which might actively 539 \nconstrain the location and generation of transverse zones during thrusting. These 540 \ninclude lateral facies and thickness variations in stratigraphy as well as dislocations 541 \nacross pre-, syn- and post-depositional fault displacements. There seems to be no 542 \nreason that the location of the transverse zone would have been determined by lateral 543 \nvariations within the Moine rocks; no systematic change in lithological character, 544 \nlithostratigraphy or gross thickness of these psammitic units occurs across the 545 \ntermination wall which might control rheology and therefore constrain the geometry 546 \nand location of the developing culmination.  547 \n The geophysical modelling concludes that the south-western flank of the Lairg 548 \ngravity low is generated largely as a response to an underlying basement ramp. Steps 549 \nin the basement-cover interface generated across reactivated basement shear zones 550 \nhave also constrained the thrust architecture in the interior of the Assynt Culmination 551 \nat a much smaller, more localised scale (Krabbendam and Leslie this volume). These 552 \nre-activated sub-vertical basement shear zones have a long history of repeated 553 \nmovement prior to deposition of the Cambro-Ordovician succession on the Foreland 554 \n(Beacom et al. 2001), and post-deposition kilometre-scale sinistral oblique 555 \ndisplacements are known to have disrupted the Cambro-Ordovician \u2018layer-cake\u2019 prior 556 \nto the onset of thrusting (Soper and England 1995; Krabbendam and Leslie this 557 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 18 - \nvolume). The regional gravity data permits extrapolation of these important structures 558 \nbeneath the Moine outcrop; the OTZ aligns with the Strathan and Canisp Shear zones 559 \nin the foreland (Fig. 1). We suggest that the basement ramp modelled at the SW 560 \nmargin of the Lairg gravity low exerted the major controlling influence over the 561 \ndevelopment of the Oykel Transverse Zone (albeit at a larger scale).  562 \n 563 \nGrowth of the Cassley Culmination 564 \nThe Cassley Culmination developed within an overall foreland-propagating 565 \ndeformation system. Critically, the main deformation phase above and associated with 566 \nthe Achness Thrust (Achness Phase) pre-dated the main phase of deformation below 567 \n(Ben Hope Phase). These and other constraints are consistent with a structural 568 \nevolution model described below (a-g) and illustrated in Fig. 11. Foreland-569 \npropagating thrusting is also documented within the Moine Nappe along strike to the 570 \nnorth in the Ben Hee area (Cheer et al. this volume) and in north Sutherland 571 \n(Holdsworth 1989; Alsop & Holdsworth 2007; Alsop et al. 1996; Holdsworth et al. 572 \n2001, 2006, 2007). 573 \n  574 \na) A pervasive LS fabric and associated tight-to-isoclinal folds formed first 575 \nwithin the structurally highest Morar Group rocks in the incipient Achness 576 \nNappe. The Loch Shin anticline was associated with large-scale interfolding of 577 \nMoine rocks and Lewisianoid basement gneisses. Some fold axes, including 578 \nthe Einig fold pair, were progressively rotated into sub-parallelism with the 579 \nregional transport direction. This deformation episode constitutes the Achness 580 \nPhase (Table 1, Fig. 11). 581 \nb) The earliest time slice in Fig. 11 represents focussed (easy) slip on the 582 \nAchness Thrust plane which was associated with the interleaving of thin slices 583 \nof Lewisianoid basement with the Moine cover.  584 \nc) As contraction continued, increased resistance to translation on the Achness 585 \nthrust effected transfer of strain down into the footwall rocks. WNW-vergent 586 \nfold systems (the F2BH \u2018Cassley Folds\u2019) developed in the incipient Ben Hope 587 \nNappe (Ben Hope Phase, Table 1). The Achness Thrust and structurally 588 \noverlying folds were bulged up and folded in the developing Cassley 589 \nCulmination. The Einig fold pair tilted towards the present downward-facing 590 \nattitude and mullions begin to form in the OTZ (see also below) 591 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 19 - \nd) The Ben Hope Thrust then developed, and strain became focussed along that 592 \nstructure. A branch line joining the Achness and Ben Hope thrusts was 593 \noriented (sub)parallel to transport; the Cassley Culmination and the OTZ 594 \nbecame more sharply defined. Uplift of the Achness Nappe continued, but 595 \nmullion development may have become much less significant in that panel.  596 \ne) In time, the above process repeated itself; translation stuck on the Ben Hope 597 \nThrust plane, strain transferred downwards once again, this time into the 598 \nfootwall of the Ben Hope Thrust, and (north of Loch Shin only) a series of 599 \nwest-vergent folds developed thus explaining the greater cross-strike width of 600 \nthe Moine Nappe s.s. in this region. Mullions formed in the Ben Hope Nappe 601 \nand mullions overprinted earlier fabrics in the Achness Nappe\/OTZ. 602 \nf) Major, smooth movement (up to 100 km?) on the Moine Thrust throughout the 603 \nregion occurred, but little localised uplift occurs with the Cassley Culmination 604 \nor within its termination wall. Development of the Moine Thrust and the 605 \nassociated mylonitic rocks seems to be broadly similar north and south of the 606 \nOTZ, in contrast to the earlier localisation of strain in the OTZ. Mullion 607 \ndevelopment ceased in the OTZ. 608 \ng) Strain was transferred farther down into the footwall of the Moine Thrust and 609 \nthe Assynt Culmination began to develop below the Cassley Culmination, 610 \nleading to further uplift of that structure and further steepening of the 611 \nculmination wall. During this phase, uplift in the hanging wall of the Assynt 612 \nCulmination also generated the swing in strike across Loch Shin (Figs. 1, 2). 613 \n 614 \nThe evolution of the Cassley Culmination is thus characterised by phases 615 \nduring which folding is dominant, alternating with phases during which thrusting is 616 \ndominant, i.e. deformation alternates between distributed and localised modes. Strain 617 \nlocalisation is generally associated with strain softening (e.g. Watts & Williams 1983, 618 \nBos and Spiers 2002), so this may also be seen as alternating phases of hardening and 619 \nsoftening strain. Even assuming a constant overall convergence rate, it is likely that 620 \nlocally differential strain rates developed; a relatively fast strain rate when localisation 621 \noccurred, a relatively slow strain rate when strain was more distributed. We postulate 622 \nhere that the Cassley Culmination did not, as a result, deform with constant strain rate, 623 \nbut in alternating \u2018slow\u2019 and \u2018fast\u2019 phases, associated with folding and thrusting 624 \nrespectively. In contrast, we suggest that the Achness Nappe to south of the OTZ 625 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 20 - \nexperienced less strong strain rate changes and kept moving northwestward in a more 626 \ncontinuous fashion, with smooth thrusting accommodated along the (proto-) Moine 627 \nThrust (i.e. along the segment between Knockan Crag and Ullapool, Fig. 1). This 628 \nwould have resulted in phases of differential movement along the OTZ \u2013 see below.  629 \n 630 \nOrigin of mullions and non-plane strain 631 \nThe mullion fabric (LM) has a clearly constrictional symmetry, characteristic of an 632 \noverall prolate (cigar-shaped) finite strain ellipsoid. The precise mechanism by which 633 \nthe mullions developed into discrete, but interlocking, structures is not fully 634 \nunderstood. Soper (in press) suggests that inner-arc space problems associated with 635 \nthe folding at Oykel Bridge, combined with flexural slip on non-parallel surfaces 636 \n(bedding and cross-bedding) that were deforming within a constrictional flow field, 637 \nled to the initiation of many small, roughly coaxial folds with variably oriented axial 638 \nsurfaces, and their eventual detachment to form the nested mullion columns.  639 \n How might growth of the Cassley Culmination have promoted the formation 640 \nof mullions, and how was constriction achieved? In the scenario outlined above, there 641 \nmust have been periods of differential movement along the OTZ; in periods of 642 \ndistributed deformation when folds formed during \u2018culmination building\u2019, the Ben 643 \nHope Nappe moving north-westward at a slower rate than the Achness Nappe south 644 \nof the transverse zone. This would have produced an effective dextral shear-couple 645 \nacross the  culmination wall (Fig. 12). At times of localised thrusting on both sides of 646 \nthe transverse zone, the relative velocity of the separate nappes would be negligible, 647 \nand so no differential movement would have occurred. Given development of a 648 \ndextral shear couple, any angle between the strike of the culmination wall and the 649 \nregional transport direction would result in either dextral transpression or 650 \ntranstension, and hence to strong non-plane strain development. From the gravity 651 \npotential field data, the OTZ has a strike of c. 310\u00b0N, whilst the regional thrust 652 \ntransport direction was 290\u00b0N (McClay & Coward 1981). In this case, transtension 653 \nwith a high kinematic vorticity number (i.e. with a large component of strike slip) 654 \nwould result (Fig. 12). Transtension under such circumstances would result in a 655 \nprolate finite strain ellipse (constriction) under most boundary conditions (Dewey et 656 \nal. 1998 and references therein; Fossen & Tikoff 1998; see also Coward and Potts 657 \n1983), providing a plausible explanation for the formation of the mullions during 658 \nculmination building.  659 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 21 - \nConclusions  660 \nWe favour a model of punctuated movement during development of the Cassley 661 \nCulmination. Thrust stacking in the Cassley Culmination built a ductile critical-taper 662 \nwedge in the Moine rocks (Davis et al. 1983; Holdsworth 1989; Dahlen 1990; 663 \nWilliams et al. 1994). When that Moine wedge was sufficiently thickened to attain the 664 \ncritical taper angle, a large-scale basal detachment or d\u00e9collement would be created 665 \n(Williams et al. 1994), thus generating the thick welt of mylonitic rocks which are 666 \npreserved in the hanging wall of the brittle Moine Thrust. In this model, the 667 \nlocalisation and intensification of deformation represented by the mylonitic Moine 668 \nrocks in the Moine Thrust Zone would \u2018switch off\u2019 any further deformation in the 669 \nCassley Culmination above the d\u00e9collement. Any further uplift in the Cassley 670 \nCulmination would be a response to the growth of the Assynt Culmination beneath 671 \nand may have been limited to further steepening of the culmination wall and the 672 \nstrike-swing observed across Loch Shin. Finally: 673 \n 674 \n\u2022 The Cassley Culmination is a regional-scale culmination in the hanging wall 675 \nof the Moine Thrust, comprising a thick sequence of Morar Group psammitic 676 \nrocks and associated slivers of basement gneiss. The Achness Thrust forms the 677 \nroof thrust to the culmination, the Ben Hope Nappe lies within the 678 \nculmination. The culmination is of similar scale to the classic Assynt 679 \nCulmination, structurally below in the brittle Moine Thrust Belt.  680 \n\u2022 The OTZ defines the lateral southern termination of the culmination and 681 \nstrikes approximately parallel to the WNW-directed thrust transport direction. 682 \nThe culmination wall comprises a c. 5 km thick panel of sheared psammitic 683 \nrock, extending for c. 20 km from Assynt almost to the Kyle of Sutherland. 684 \nThe classic mullions of Oykel Bridge occur within the OTZ.  685 \n\u2022 The OTZ is coincident with the southeast edge of the regional-scale Lairg 686 \ngravity low. That feature is modelled as the signature of a pronounced NE-687 \ninclined ramp in the depth to basement.  688 \n\u2022 The dominant fabric and associated folds in the Ben Hope Nappe locally 689 \noverprint the dominant fabric and folds in the Achness Nappe and the Achness 690 \nThrust itself; there is no single regional dominant \u2018S2\u2019 fabric in the Moine 691 \nNappe. 692 \nContinental Tectonics and Mountain Building - The Legacy of Peach and Horne \n \nC:\\temp\\1344_1_art_file_28384_khhhpq.doc \n \nPage No.- 22 - \n\u2022 The classic mullions of Oykel Bridge are more widely distributed than 693 \npreviously thought and occur in both the Achness and Ben Hope nappes. In 694 \nthe Ben Hope Thrust, the mullions are parallel to the main intersection 695 \nlineation; in the Achness Nappe, the mullions overprint the main fabric and 696 \nintersection lineation, although they commonly occur sub-parallel to the latter.  697 \n\u2022 A clear sequence of foreland-propagating thrust development can be 698 \nascertained. The Achness Nappe was the earliest to develop, with penetrative 699 \nfabrics and tight folds in the hanging wall. This Achness phase was followed 700 \nby development of folds below the Achness Nappe, but only north of the OTZ. 701 \nThese folds thickened the pile and uplifted the Achness Nappe north of Glen 702 \nOykel and the OTZ was formed. Mullion structures continued to develop at 703 \nthis time, perhaps predominantly in the Ben Hope Nappe. Subsequently, the 704 \nBen Hope Thrust formed.  705 \n\u2022 This process repeated itself. Fabrics developed in rocks lying in the footwall to 706 \nthe Ben Hope Thrust. As strain passed into the Moine Nappe below the Ben 707 \nHope Thrust, structural change in the Ben Hope and Achness nappes was 708 \nlimited to uplift and mullion development ceased. The ductile Moine Thrust 709 \nnow developed north of the OTZ forming the floor of the Cassley 710 \nCulmination.  711 \n\u2022 Overall, thrust displacement was continually smooth south of the OTZ, whilst 712 \nto the north intermittent thrust movement dominated, with periods of 713 \ndistributed deformation during fold development and thickening alternating 714 \nwith displacement along thrusts. 715 \n\u2022 This contrast of quasi-continuous versus intermittent fold-and-thrust 716 \nmovement resulted in periods of differential, dextral strike-slip movement 717 \nalong the OTZ. Given the observed small angle between transport direction 718 \nand strike of the OTZ (c. 20\u00b0, Fig. 12), resultant transtension locally produced 719 \nconstriction, a plausible explanation for the development of the classic mullion 720 \nstructures observed at Oykel Bridge. 721 \n 722 \nAcknowledgements: AGL, MK and GSK publish with the permission of the Director, British 723 \nGeological Survey.
