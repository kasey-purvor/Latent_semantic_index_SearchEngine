Rosser.]\nRecent analysis of the human genome sequence has revealed the\nextraordinary prevalence of segmental duplications, or paralogs.\nThese highly similar nonallelic sequences make up 5.2% of the\ngenome (Bailey et al. 2002), providing plentiful substrates for\nnonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). NAHR leads to\nrearrangements, including a pathogenic subset involving gene\ndisruption through inversion, or gene copy number alteration\nthrough deletion or duplication (for review, see Lupski 1998).\nHomologous recombination is initiated via strand invasion\nand can be resolved not only through crossovers but also through\ngene conversion, the nonreciprocal transfer of genetic informa-\ntion between homologous sequences. Gene conversion is a fun-\ndamental process of molecular evolution and has been most in-\ntensively studied in yeast, in which all four haploid products of\nmeiosis can be readily examined within tetrads. It is less well\nunderstood in humans, because meiotic segregation means that\nonly one product is ever observed, and therefore, nonreciprocal\ntransfer (conversion) cannot be formally distinguished from re-\nciprocal transfer (double crossover).\nGene conversion between paralogs located on the same\nchromosome can have two effects. First, within a chromosome it\ncan act as a homogenizing force, increasing lengths of identity\nbetween duplicated sequences (concerted evolution) and thus\nproviding a more readily used substrate for NAHR. Second, be-\ncause different conversion events occur in different chromo-\nsomes, it can generate excess sequence diversity among them\u2014a\nphenomenon recognized in organisms as diverse as humans,\nflies, and protozoans (Giordano et al. 1997; King 1998; Nielsen et\nal. 2003). In principle, the dynamics of these processes can be\ninferred by comparative sequencing of paralogs in different in-\ndividuals, but in most of the genome, such studies are difficult to\ninterpret because of sequence diversity between alleles of para-\nlogs and because the underlying evolutionary relationships be-\ntween different paralog copies are unknown. Neither of these\nproblems applies to the Y chromosome. Because it is haploid, we\ndo not need to consider interallelic diversity; because there is no\ncrossing over, paralogs cannot have independent evolutionary\nhistories; and because there is an established phylogeny based on\nbinary markers, we know the precise evolutionary relationships\nof chromosomes belonging to different lineages. The Y chromo-\nsome therefore provides a useful model to study gene conversion\nbetween paralogs.\nTwo human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs) flank\na 780-kb region on Yq containing at least one gene required in\nspermatogenesis (Fig. 1A).

A second apparent conversion\nin a single chromosome was also identified; in this example, the\ntransfer was proximal to distal and involved two paralogous se-\nquence variants (PSVs) adjacent to a large tract of inter-HERV\nidentity. Its length is therefore very uncertain (between 5 and\n1289 bp), because one end could lie anywhere within the large\ntract of identity.\nTwo other apparently nonreciprocal exchanges between the\nHERVs have been described (Blanco et al. 2000), and each repre-\nsents a monophyletic group of chromosomes (haplogroups D2\nand J; Fig. 1C). These two independent events involve the trans-\nFigure 1 HERV structures, HERV-sponsored rearrangements, and the phylogenetic positions of known double-crossover and gene conversion events.\n(A) Structures of the proximal and distal AZFa HERVs, showing blocks of identity >200 bp (hatched boxes) and the L1 fragment insertion in the distal\nHERV. Identity blocks A through D are named according to Bosch and Jobling (2003). Flanking specific primers (large arrows) and primers used for the\namplification of the region between identity blocks A and D (small arrows) are shown. (B) Possible sequence rearrangements sponsored by the HERVs:\nSingle meiotic crossover between misaligned sister chromatids (in the same orientation) causes deletion or duplication of the AZFa region, both of which\nhave been observed; double crossover causes the transfer of a large segment of one HERV to the other, observed in the proximal-to-distal case only; and\ngene conversion causes the nonreciprocal transfer of small segments, observed in both polarities. (C) Phylogeny of the Y chromosome showing known\ndouble-crossover and gene conversion events. Two examples of proximal-to-distal transfer through double-crossover are known: The concomitant loss\nof the L1 segment from the distal HERV is typed as a binary marker (Casanova et al. 1985) and defines haplogroup J (12f2.1). The second occurrence\n(12f2.2) is phylogenetically equivalent to binary markers defining haplogroup D2 (Blanco et al. 2000). A distal-to-proximal conversion of between 36\nand 72 bp is phylogenetically equivalent to the marker P25, defining haplogroup R1b; one example of a chromosome with a proximal-to-distal\nconversion within this haplogroup is also known (Bosch and Jobling 2003).\nBosch et al.\n836 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nfer of \u223c5 kb of sequence, lying between identity blocks A and B,\nfrom the proximal to the distal HERV, in the process removing\nthe distal-specific 1.5-kb insertion of L1 material (Fig. 1B). These\nevents are regarded as double crossovers rather than as gene con-\nversions, because the transferred segment is so large and because\nthe stretch of complete heterology represented by the L1 frag-\nment is likely to disrupt branch migration.\nHere, prompted by the evidence for gene conversion within\nthe inter-AD segment, we investigate further the sequence diver-\nsity of the AZFa HERVs in this region. We identify a hotspot for\ngene conversion of biased directionality, estimate the rate of con-\nversion and the mean conversion tract length by using the frame-\nwork of the Y phylogeny, and, by analyzing the sequences of\ngreat ape homologs, show that conversion in this hotspot has a\ndeep evolutionary history.\nRESULTS\nSequence Diversity of Proximal and Distal\nInter-AD Regions\nWe determined the sequence of the 787-bp inter-AD region in\nproximal and distal HERVs from 33 human Y chromosomes, cho-\nsen for their wide coverage of the Y phylogeny. These sequences,\ntogether with three previously published examples (Bosch and\nJobling 2003), were compared to the database reference se-\nquence, which contains 24 differences between proximal and\ndistal HERVs (PSVs) comprising 22 base substitutions and two\nsingle-base indels within the inter-AD segment (Fig. 2). The new\nsequences reveal no new PSVs; the reference sequence contains\nall the 24 PSVs observed between the proximal and distal inter-\nAD sequences in our sample.\nWe first consider the diversity of the proximal inter-AD se-\nquences. All six sequences within haplogroup R1b show the dis-\ntal-to-proximal conversion of four adjacent PSVs (PSV 3\u20136) de-\nscribed previously (Bosch and Jobling 2003). Two chromosomes\nwithin haplogroup J have a deletion of 13 bp between PSVs 18\nand 19. All other proximal inter-AD sequences are identical to\nthe reference sequence.\nThe distal inter-AD sequences present a very different pic-\nture. The 36 different chromosomes possess 14 distinct se-\nquences. The two distal sequences within haplogroup D2 are\nidentical to the proximal sequences, reflecting the known\ndouble-crossover event transferring \u223c5 kb from the proximal to\nthe distal HERV (Blanco et al. 2000). Likewise, the independent\ndouble-crossover event within haplogroup J is reflected by the\nidentity of the proximal and distal sequences in the two chro-\nmosomes belonging to this haplogroup, including the proximal-\nto-distal transfer of the 13-bp deletion. We do not consider these\nfour sequences further here, because the absence of PSVs makes\nthem uninformative.\nThe remaining distal inter-AD sequences are highly diverse:\nnucleotide diversity (\u0001) for the distal sequences is 5.44\u0001 10\u00023,\ncompared with a value for the proximal sequences of\n1.60\u0001 10\u00023. It is difficult to make a fair comparison of this value\nwith published estimates of \u0001 for the Y chromosome, because we\nascertained our samples nonrandomly. However, as far as corre-\nspondences can be drawn, the published survey of Shen et al.\n(2000) covers a similar range of diversity to our sample, including\nchromosomes belonging to all top-level clades in the Y phylog-\neny with the possible exceptions of F*, H, K*, L, N, and P*. That\nstudy found an average nucleotide diversity for noncoding re-\ngions of only 9.9\u0001 10\u00025. Typical values of nucleotide diversity\nfor autosomal sequences range from 5.3 \u0001 10\u00024 to 8.8\u0001 10\u00024\n(Fullerton et al. 2000; Zhao et al. 2000; Yu et al. 2001). The high\ndiversity we observe in distal inter-AD sequences is manifested as\na patchy pattern of proximal-like PSVs among the distal PSVs;\ntheir total number ranges from a single PSV (e.g., m348) to 13\n(m230). Strikingly, 19 of the 24 PSVs are found to be polymor-\nphic among the distal inter-AD sequences, whereas none of the\n723 non-PSV sites are polymorphic.\nThe overall pattern of sequence variation is not concordant\nwith the known Y phylogeny. There are some examples of chro-\nmosomes lying within the same haplogroup of the phylogeny\nthat share identical or closely related patterns of proximal-like\nPSVs (e.g., m230 and YCC23 within haplogroup C). Also, it could\nbe argued that PSV 6 arose as a T-to-C substitution at the root of\nthe clade Y(xA,B). However, there are other cases in which PSVs\nappear in distinct haplogroups in a way that cannot be explained\nby common descent. An example is PSV 18, which in the distal\nHERV reference sequence is an A, but is a G in several indepen-\ndent haplogroups, and therefore displays homoplasy (apparent\nrecurrent mutation).\nWhat mechanism has generated this sequence diversity? In\nprinciple there are four possibilities: (1) Recombination among Y\nchromosomes; this could occur under special circumstances,\nsuch as between a segment of Y chromosome from one hap-\nlogroup carried as a translocation on a non-Y-chromosome, and\na free Y chromosome from another haplogroup (Jobling and\nTyler-Smith 2003). However, this has yet to be observed, and it\nseems unlikely that such an inherently rare event would have\noccurred multiple times within a small segment of DNA. (2) An-\nother possibility is base mutation: this can be rejected because all\nchanges in the distal HERV affect only the PSVs, resulting in\nsequence states found in the proximal HERV, and because se-\nquence differences often affect contiguous sets of PSVs (e.g.,\nYCC33, YCC5). (3) A third possibility is redeletion of AZFa du-\nplication chromosomes: these (Bosch and Jobling 2003) contain\nthree HERVs rather than two (see Fig. 1A), and could undergo\ndeletion to generate HERVs containing a patchwork of distal- and\nproximal-specific PSVs, provided that the breakpoints of the\noriginal duplication and subsequent redeletion were different.\nHowever, given the restriction of known deletion and duplica-\ntion breakpoints to the A and B\/C blocks of absolute sequence\nidentity, we do not consider that this mechanism provides a\nviable explanation. (4) The fourth possibility is gene conversion:\nthis remains the most parsimonious explanation for the observed\npattern of sequence diversity.\nNumber and Rate of Gene Conversion Events\nClearly, the gene conversion events are directional, in that there\nare many more conversions of PSVs within distal inter-AD se-\nquences to proximal-like states than vice versa. We see only one\nexample of distal-to-proximal conversion (in haplogroup R1b).\nThe number of proximal-to-distal events can be counted by con-\nsidering the phylogeny\u2014when two or more chromosomes\nwithin a haplogroup have the same pattern of proximal-to-distal\nconversion, we regard it as being due to common ancestry rather\nthan to independent events. We also make the simplifying as-\nsumptions that each contiguous tract represents a single event,\nthat the reference sequence can be regarded as ancestral (because\nit contains all 24 PSVs), and that a change at a single PSV repre-\nsents a gene conversion event, rather than a base mutation, on\nthe basis of arguments given above. In this way we identify a\nminimum of 22 putative independent conversion events (Fig. 3).\nTo estimate the rate of conversion, we need to know the\ntotal amount of time during which the events have occurred (see\nSupplemental figure). We can place lower and upper bounds on\nthis by estimating the maximum and minimum plausible elapsed\ntime since all the chromosomes analyzed (neglecting those in\nhaplogroups D2 and J) had a common ancestor. First, we con-\nHuman Gene Conversion Hotspot\nGenome Research 837\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nFigure 2 (Legend on next page)\nBosch et al.\n838 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nsider the lower rate bound. The 32 chromosomes belong to 10\ndistinct upper-level haplogroups in the Y chromosome phylog-\neny. Time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each of\nthese haplogroups has been estimated by coalescent analysis\n(Hammer and Zegura 2002), so to relate these 10 sets of chromo-\nsomes, we take the upper bound on each of these haplogroup\nages (Fig. 3). For chromosomes within a haplogroup, we then\nassume a star-like genealogy; this represents an overestimate of\nthe intra-haplogroup TMRCAs and is conservative in neglecting\nmore recent common ancestry. For a generation time of 25 years,\nthis process yields a maximum total elapsed time of 90,274 gen-\nerations. To estimate the minimum time in which the conver-\nsions could have occurred, we first consider the lower bounds on\nthe published TMRCAs (Hammer and Zegura 2002) for the hap-\nlogroups shown in Figure 3 and, to minimize time within-\nhaplogroup, make the reductio ad absurdum assumption that each\nset of chromosomes within a haplogroup descends from a com-\nmon ancestor only one generation ago. The minimum summed\ntime is then 18,686 generations. These minimum and maximum\ntimes are highly conservative and are therefore highly likely to\nbracket the actual elapsed time. Twenty-two proximal-to-distal\ngene conversion events occurring over 18,686 to 90,274 genera-\ntions represents an average rate of between 2.4 \u0001 10\u00024 and\n1.2\u0001 10\u00023 events per generation. By the same argument, the\naverage rate of distal-to-proximal conversion is between\n1.1\u0001 10\u00025 and 5.3\u0001 10\u00025, \u223c20-fold lower than conversion in\nthe opposing direction. The overall gene conversion rate between\nthese sequences is the sum of the individual estimates for each\ndirection\u2014between 2.5\u0001 10\u00024 and 1.3\u0001 10\u00023 events per gen-\neration.\nThe position and directional bias of this hotspot may be due\nto specific features of the DNA sequence\u2014for example, a recom-\nbination signal specific to the proximal segment may make it\nactive as an initiator and donor sequence. We searched the inter-\nAD segment and adjacent parts of the A and D identity blocks for\nconsensus binding sites for proteins involved in recombination,\nand for motifs associated with recombination hotspots, with\nnegative results.\nFigure 2 Sequence states of the 24 PSVs in proximal and distal inter-AD segments within 36 Y chromosomes, organized according to the Y phylogeny.\nBases shown in white on black are distal specific, and those in black on white are proximal specific, as defined by the reference sequence (Ref). Names\nof DNA samples are given on the right; on the left, a simplified version of the Y phylogeny (Y Chromosome Consortium 2002) shows the phylogenetic\nrelationships and haplogroup names of the chromosomes analyzed. Sequences within haplogroup J contain a deletion of 13 bp between PSVs 18 and\n19, in both proximal and distal sequences. Case 1, case 2, and YCC26 proximal and distal sequences have been reported previously (respectively,\nAJ511660-1, AJ511663-4, AJ511666-7; Bosch and Jobling 2003). Sequence positions from 103 to 724 (bottom) give coordinates within the inter-AD\nsegments: The position labeled 103 is equivalent to nucleotide no. 11739 on the plus strand of AC002992 for the proximal HERV, and to nucleotide\nno. 144340 on the minus strand of AC005820 for the distal HERV.\nFigure 3 Number of independent proximal-to-distal conversion events within the sample.

Branches G and H are included,\neven though they contain no conversions, because their ages are required in the rate calculation. Branches D and J are omitted because their lack of\nPSVs makes them uninformative.\nHuman Gene Conversion Hotspot\nGenome Research 839\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nTract Length of Gene Conversion Events\nFigure 3 gives the maximum and minimum lengths of the ob-\nserved conversion tracts: they are highly nonuniform. The ob-\nserved (minimum) length of a conversion tract is the distance\nencompassing the outermost converted PSVs, but it will tend to\nunderestimate the true tract length because of the uninforma-\ntiveness of flanking sites. The relationship between observed and\ntrue lengths depends on the frequency of PSVs and also on the\ntrue tract length distribution. To derive a maximum-likelihood\nestimate of the mean true tract length, we use a modified version\nof the method of Betr\u00e1n et al. (1997), assuming a geometric dis-\ntribution of underlying tract lengths. The standard version of this\nmethod considers a gene conversion event to have occurred if at\nleast two variant sites have been converted; single-site events are\nrejected, because they could result from base mutation. Abiding\nby this restriction would give a maximum-likelihood estimate of\nthe mean true tract length of 62 bp. From the arguments made\nabove, however, we consider single-site events to represent con-\nversion, yielding a mean length of 31 bp. Although we abide by\nconvention in estimating this mean length, it is worth noting\nthat recent work on allelic gene conversion in meiotic recombi-\nnation hotspots (Jeffreys and May 2004) showed that the dual\nuncertainties over tract position and length resulting from un-\neven marker spacing meant that the observed tract lengths were\ncompatible with a range of mean lengths (maximum-likelihood\nestimates ranging from 63 to 200 bp), under many different mod-\nels.\nA Deeper History of Gene Conversion\nin the Inter-AD Segment\nTo ask whether this dynamic conversion process is evolutionarily\nconserved, we analyzed the sequence of proximal and distal in-\nter-AD segments in a chimpanzee and a gorilla, and compared\nthese to the human reference sequence; note that the latter con-\ntains the greatest number of human PSVs, and that the intraspe-\ncific diversity of the great ape sequences is unknown. Table 1\nshows sequence divergences between the species for proximal\nand distal segments; all divergences except one (proximal inter-\nAD between human and chimpanzee) are significantly elevated\nover a control noncoding sequence from the SMCY gene region\n(Shen et al. 2000; Chen and Li 2001). This unusually high diver-\ngence between all three species suggests that gene conversion in\nthe inter-AD segment has a deep evolutionary history: If conver-\nsion elevates sequence diversity within a species, it can also be\nexpected to elevate sequence divergence between species. The\nobservation that the proximal inter-AD human-chimp compari-\nson is not elevated could be explained if conversion in chimpan-\nzees, as in humans, was directional.\nIf gene conversion has been evolutionarily persistent, we\nexpect to see clustering of paralogs, rather than orthologs, in\ninterspecific comparisons\u2014evidence of concerted evolution. In a\nphylogenetic network produced by split decomposition (Fig. 4A),\nthis is exactly what we observe. Clustering is especially tight for\nthe chimpanzee sequences, suggesting that conversion has been\nparticularly active in chimpanzees. The presence of reticulations\nwithin the network (i.e., the absence of a completely tree-like\nstructure) shows that gene conversion has not completely eradi-\ncated evidence of the orthologous relationships, although it has\nresulted in a paucity of PSVs shared between species. The chim-\npanzee sequences contain 10 PSVs, and the gorilla sequences\ncontain 21; however, the chimpanzee shares no PSVs with either\nof the other species, and only three PSVs are shared between\nhuman and gorilla. The sequence states of these three human\/\ngorilla-shared PSVs indicate that (as suggested above) the direc-\ntionality of the conversion in the chimpanzee sequences at these\nsites has been proximal to distal. A further reflection of historical\ngene conversion is the phylogenetic incompatibility seen among\nthe 21 sites that are not PSVs within any species but differ between\nspecies (Fig. 4B). Phylogenetic relationships favoring all three\npossible sister-clades can be seen at sites scattered along the inter-\nAD segment: 12 sites favor a human\u2013chimpanzee grouping, six\nfavor human\u2013gorilla, and three favor gorilla\u2013chimpanzee.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated the existence of a rapid and directional\ngene conversion process acting between the paralogous AZFa-\nHERV repeats, resulting in a hotspot of gene conversion in the\ndistal inter-AD segment. How well delineated is this hotspot?\nImmediately proximal to inter-AD lies block A, 1285 bp of se-\nquence that is identical between the proximal and distal HERVs.\nGene conversion may be going on within this segment but would\nbe undetectable because of the absence of PSVs. Six gene conver-\nsion events include PSV 1, adjacent to block A, and so have one\nendpoint within the identity block; the remaining 16 are con-\ntained within inter-AD. We observe a declining frequency of\ngene conversion events toward the distal end of inter-AD, with\nthe distal-most five PSVs undergoing no conversions at all in our\nsample, thus marking the distal limit of the hotspot more clearly.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that high-frequency conver-\nsion processes are operating elsewhere within the HERVs. Proxi-\nmal to identity block A, and distal to the 330-bp block D, the\nlevel of sequence similarity between the HERVs declines dramati-\ncally, to a degree that is expected to preclude conversion (Lukac-\nsovich and Waldman 1999). Additional sequence data also sug-\ngest that conversion cannot be occurring frequently outside the\ninter-AD segment: In our study of AZFa duplications (Bosch and\nJobling 2003), we described the sequence of a 3360-bp segment\nfrom distal and proximal HERVs for three chromosomes (case 1,\ncase 2, and YCC26) belonging to haplogroups R1b*, R1b6, and\nR1b(xR1b6,R1b8). All distal sequences were identical to each\nother, except for conversions within inter-AD, and all proximal\nsequences were completely identical to each other. The partial\nsequence of a 9-kb segment from the distal HERV for two chro-\nmosomes belonging to haplogroups J and D2 has also been de-\nscribed (Blanco et al. 2000). Apart from the 13-bp deletion within\ninter-AD in haplogroup J (Fig. 2), the two sequences were iden-\ntical. This general absence of variation suggests that detectable\ngene conversion between the HERVs is indeed confined to the\ninter-AD segment.\nComparisons of inter-AD sequences between human, chim-\nTable 1.

Fur-\nthermore, the patterns of interspecific sequence divergence be-\ntween proximal and distal sequences, together with the sequence\nstates of PSVs, indicate that the proximal-to-distal directionality\nof the conversion process has also been conserved between the\nhuman and chimpanzee lineages.\nPreviously, indirect evidence for interallelic gene conversion\nin humans has emerged from observations of lower-than-\nexpected linkage disequilibrium between closely spaced markers\n(Ardlie et al. 2001; Frisse et al. 2001). The ratio of conversion to\ncrossover was calculated as 7.3 (Frisse et al. 2001), but this was\nunder a model in which tract length was assumed to be 500 bp.\nRecent direct analysis of interallelic conversion in sperm DNA\nwithin three human meiotic recombination hotspots (Jeffreys\nand May 2004) reveals short (maximum-likelihood mean length,\n63 to 200 bp) conversion tracts centered at the peak of crossover\nactivity. At the most intensively studied hotspot, conversion pre-\ndominates over crossover at a ratio of \u223c4 to 15:1; if this were\nFigure 4 Phylogenetic network analysis and sequence comparison of human, chimp, and gorilla inter-AD segments.

Ascertainment\nof AZFa deletions is good because of the associated infertile phe-\nnotype, and a generous estimate of their overall rate is \u223c4\u0001 10\u00024\nper generation (Bosch and Jobling 2003). Although the number\nof AZFa rearrangements so far described at the molecular level\n(Blanco et al. 2000; Kamp et al. 2000; Sun et al. 2000; Bosch and\nJobling 2003) is only 15, all have their breakpoints within the\nblocks of identity (A and B\/C) and none in the inter-AD segment.\nInter-AD breakpoints may be identified in the future, but it seems\nlikely that conversion predominates greatly over crossover in this\nhotspot.\nThough Jeffreys and May (2004) suggest that similar mecha-\nnisms may be operating during both interallelic and interparalog\nconversion, direct evidence is currently lacking. Data on inter-\nparalog conversion come mainly from the occasional detection\nof variant or pathologically mutated genes in which an altered\nsequence tract can be shown to have originated in a paralogous\ngene copy (Collier et al. 1993; Papadakis and Patrinos 1999;\nOgasawara et al. 2001). Rates for such processes cannot be easily\ndeduced, but tract lengths are typically estimated as a few hun-\ndred base pairs. Studies of interallelic conversion at the HLA-\nDPB1 locus in sperm DNA (Zangenberg et al. 1995) reveal param-\neters in similar ranges to those that we observe: a rate of 2.8 to\n13.3\u0001 10\u00025 per sperm in a 240-bp region, tract lengths between\n54 and 132 bp, and a probable conversion to crossover ratio of\n>20 (Frisse et al. 2001). In principle, direct access to interparalog\nconversion and recombination events in sperm DNA within the\nAZFa HERVs is feasible.\nRecent studies of the near-complete sequence of the Y eu-\nchromatin have shown evidence of high-frequency gene conver-\nsion between arms of abundant paralogous sequences arranged\nas giant palindromes (Rozen et al. 2003). Assuming a steady-state\nbalance between the introduction of new mutations and their\nhomogenization by gene conversion, the observed sequence di-\nvergence between palindrome arms was used to calculate a rate of\n2.2\u0001 10\u00024 conversions per duplicated base per 20-year genera-\ntion (equivalent to 2.8\u0001 10\u00024 for a 25-year generation). The\nprevalence of these palindromes is a peculiarity of the Y chro-\nmosome, and these observations may be of limited relevance to\nthe rest of the genome. However, the rates we calculate here are\nfor direct repeats separated by 780 kb and may be more generally\napplicable. For proximal-to-distal conversions, they correspond\nto between 3.9\u0001 10\u00027 and 1.9\u0001 10\u00026 per base per generation\n(considering the 622 bp of the inter-AD segment, including the\noutermost PSVs), which, although much lower than the palin-\ndrome rate, is still two to three orders of magnitude higher than\nthe base mutation rate (Thomson et al. 2000). As is the case for\nthe sequences we have studied here, conversions between the\npalindrome arms are not peculiar to the human species but occur\nin other tested primates. Comparisons of human\u2013chimpanzee\nsequence divergence in palindrome arms with that in nonpalin-\ndrome regions suggests that gene conversion here is acting as a\nconservative force (Rozen et al. 2003), reducing sequence diver-\ngence rather than increasing it as we observe; in principle, this\ncould occur through natural selection favoring ancestral states or\nthrough opposing biases in gene conversion and mutation.\nIn an early study (Dorit et al. 1995) a 729-bp intron of the\nZFY gene was sequenced in 38 Y chromosomes selected for their\npopulation diversity and therefore probably covering many of\nthe major haplogroups of the Y phylogeny (Jobling and Tyler-\nSmith 2003). Famously, this study found no variant sites what-\nsoever. On a chromosome renowned for its low variability, the\npresence of 19 variant sites in 36 copies of the similarly sized\ndistal inter-AD segment and one of the highest known values of\n\u0001 in the human genome provide a dramatic illustration of the\nability of gene conversion to generate diversity among DNA se-\nquences. Further comparative sequencing of segmental duplica-\ntions is required to investigate whether the preferential mapping\nof dbSNP entries to paralogous sequences reflects not only mis-\nassignment of sequence reads but also elevated sequence diver-\nsity (Hurles 2002).\nMETHODS\nSamples\nDNA samples with the prefix \u201cYCC\u201d are from the Y Chromosome\nConsortium, and haplogroup information is as described (Y\nChromosome Consortium 2002). Other samples of known hap-\nlogroup were gifts from Chris Tyler-Smith (Wellcome Trust\nSanger Institute, UK) and Qasim Mehdi (Dr. A.Q. Khan Research\nLaboratories, Pakistan), or from collections of the authors.\nHERV Amplifications and Sequencing Analysis\nPrimers and PCR conditions for the amplification of HERV se-\nquences were as described (Bosch and Jobling 2003).\nThe inter-AD region was reamplified from proximal- and\ndistal-specific human and gorilla HERV amplicons by using the\nprimers UNIV (5\u0004-TTGTGGAGCCTATGGTCTCTAT-3\u0004) and\nQL2rev (5\u0004-CTCAGCAGGAATCTGTCCTAA-3\u0004). Nested PCR con-\nditions were as described (Bosch and Jobling 2003), except that\nextension time was reduced to 1 min and the total cycle number\nreduced to 20. PCR products were purified from agarose gels and\nused as templates for sequencing by using the same primers.\nThe UNIV-QL2rev amplification was not possible in chim-\npanzee HERVs; subsequent sequencing showed several differ-\nences in the UNIV primer target sequence. We therefore ampli-\nfied two overlapping fragments covering the same region from\neach HERV copy. Primers for the amplification of the first frag-\nment (1873 bp) were SQ3 (5\u0004-ACACAGTATGTAGGGAATGC-3\u0004)\nand Int2 (5\u0004-CTGTTGCCCTGTGCCTCATA-3\u0004); for the second\nfragment (1901 bp), SQ4 (5\u0004-TTAACACTCATGCTGCCCTG-3\u0004)\nand SQ1 (5\u0004-CAAAGGAAGCAGAGGAACCT-3\u0004). Both of these\nPCR products from each HERV copy were purified from agarose\ngels and used as template for sequencing with primers SQ3 and\nSQ4, respectively.\nSequencing reactions were performed by using the ABI-\nPRISM Big Dye terminator chemistry (version 2), according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations, and analyzed on a ABI3100\ncapillary sequencing apparatus (Applied Biosystems).\nAll sequences were compared with the database reference\nsequences AC002992 (proximal) and AC005820 (distal). These\ntwo sequences derive from different Y chromosomes and there-\nfore do not necessarily lie together on any \u201creal\u201d Y chromosome.\nHowever, five chromosomes analyzed here have the same proxi-\nmal\/distal combination of sequences as the database; the data-\nbase sequences, as a pair, are therefore valid for use as a reference.\nNucleotide diversity was calculated by using DnaSP (Rozas and\nRozas 1999).\nAn alternative nomenclature is also used for the blocks of\nsequence identity within the HERVs: block A in this study is\nequivalent to block ID1 (Kamp et al. 2000) and blocks B and C\ntogether to block ID2, whereas block D has no alternative name.\nNote that the 13-bp deletion within the inter-AD segment is\nfound here in chromosomes belonging to haplogroup J, not hap-\nlogroup D2 as previously reported (Blanco et al. 2000); the hap-\nlogroups were switched in error.\nBosch et al.\n842 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nAnalysis of Gene Conversion Tract Length\nAfter determining the minimum number of gene conversion\nevents by using the phylogeny (see text), observed tract lengths\nwere estimated by using the method of Betr\u00e1n et al. (1997) as\nimplemented in DnaSP (Rozas and Rozas 1999). The method was\nmodified to allow changes at single PSVs (normally discounted)\nto be considered as gene conversion events. Average true tract\nlength was estimated from observed tract length by using a modi-\nfied maximum-likelihood method (Betr\u00e1n et al. 1997), which\nmodels gene conversion according to a geometric distribution\nwith parameter \u0002. After initiation of gene conversion, the tract\neither extends (unidirectionally) to an additional base (with\nprobability \u0002), or terminates (with probability [1 \u0002 \u0002]). The\nprobability that a tract will extend to n bases in length is then\n(1\u0002 \u0002)\u0002n\u00021 and mean tract length is 1\/(1\u0002 \u0002).\nPhylogenetic Analysis and Jukes-Cantor Distance\nInterspecific phylogenetic networks of proximal- and distal-\nspecific inter-AD HERV sequences were constructed by using\nSplitsTree (Huson 1998; http:\/\/www-ab.informatik.uni-\ntuebingen.de\/software\/splits\/welcome_en.html). Corrected\nJukes-Cantor distances between species were calculated in DnaSP\n(Rozas and Rozas 1999), and standard deviations were estimated\nas (p[1\u0002 p]\/N)\u0002 1, where p is the proportion of nucleotides\nwith substitutions, and N the length of sequence in base pairs\n(785 bp).\nRecombination Motif Searches\nThe inter-AD segment (including variant sequences as shown in\nFig. 2) and the adjacent A and D blocks were searched for a\nnumber of recombination and replication motifs using the FIND-\nPATTERNS program within GCG. We sought the sequences listed\nand referenced by Badge et al. (2000): the Escherichia coli \u0003 se-\nquence, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ade6-M26 heptamer, the\nlong terminal repeat element (LTR-IS) motif, the retrotransposon\nLTR sequence, the XY32 homopurine-pyrimidine H-palindrome\nmotif, the human minisatellite core sequence, two human hy-\npervariable minisatellite sequences, the pur and translin protein\nbinding sites, the human replication origin consensus, the S. cer-\nevisiae and S. pombe ARS consensus sequences, consensus mam-\nmalian scaffold attachment regions, and the topoisomerase II\nbinding site. Also sought was the RBP-2N recognition sequence\n(Dou et al. 1994).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Chris Tyler-Smith for supplying DNA samples, Qasim\nMehdi for sample PRS015, Peidong Shen for information about\nmarkers around the SMCY gene, Zo\u00eb Rosser for unpublished hap-\nlotyping information on m176, and Francesc Calafell for help\nwith calculations.
