Introduction\n[2] Since the realization of Dungey [1961] that convec-\ntion in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) system is\ndriven by the solar wind through magnetic reconnection, a\nlarge body of work has developed to understand its details.\nThis convection, and the effect of different interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) conditions on its intensity and mor-\nphology, is now largely understood at the global scale. More\nrecently there has been interest in understanding the\ndynamics of the system over a range of scales in a statistical\n(rather than phenomenological) framework. Many such\nstudies have demonstrated the existence of scale-free struc-\nture, i.e., a probability distribution or power spectrum of\nfluctuations with no characteristic scales (power law) over a\nwide range of scales. Examples include studies of ground\nmagnetic fields [Campbell, 1976; Francia et al., 1995;\nConsolini et al., 1998; Weatherwax et al., 2000; Abel and\nFreeman, 2002; Pulkkinen et al., 2006], ionospheric electric\nfields [Bering et al., 1995; Buchert et al., 1999; Abel and\nFreeman, 2002], the geomagnetic indices AU, AL and PC\n[Takalo et al., 1993; Takalo and Timonen, 1998; Freeman et\nal., 2000; Hnat et al., 2002] and ionospheric convection\n[Parkinson, 2006; Abel et al., 2006, 2007; Parkinson,\n2008].\n[3] It has been argued [e.g., Freeman et al., 2000] that the\nscale-free structure in the M-I system could occur either as a\nresult of direct driving by a scale-free solar wind, or as a\nresult of some internal process of the system such as Self\nOrganized Criticality (SOC) [Chang, 1992] or internal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence [e.g., Borovsky\net al., 1997]. Both these ideas were invoked by Abel et al.\n[2006] to interpret a spatial analysis of ionospheric plasma\nvelocity measurements. They found that the scaling of the\nfirst order structure function is different in the regions of the\npolar ionosphere on open and closed magnetic field lines,\nsuggesting different sources. Furthermore, the scaling expo-\nnent on open field lines was similar to that seen in the solar\nwind [e.g., Hnat et al., 2005], suggesting direct driving\nin this region. Parkinson [2006] also found similarities\nbetween PDFs of temporal ionospheric plasma velocity\nfluctuations on open field lines and fluctuations in the\nAkasofu \u0002 parameter (with less similarity displayed on\nclosed field lines). Ionospheric velocity fluctuations have\nbeen probed further using structure function analysis, com-\nparing observations with predictions coming from descrip-\ntions of turbulence based on the Navier-Stokes equations\n(Kolmogorov K41 turbulence), extensions of this theory to\ninclude the effects of a strong magnetic field (Kraichnan-\nIroshnikov KI65 turbulence) and various multifractal (inter-\nmittent) versions of these models [e.g., Frisch, 1995, and\nreferences therein]. In this way, Abel et al. [2007] showed\nthat the plasma velocity fluctuations in the polar ionosphere\nare generally consistent with models of intermittent KI65\nturbulence.\n[4] In this paper we extend this study to investigate how\nthe turbulent structure in the ionosphere depends on the\nIMF direction and hence on the geometry and effectiveness\nof magnetic reconnection.\n2. Methodology\n[5] The methodology used in this study is identical to that\nemployed by Abel et al. [2007] with the added condition\nthat the data are subdivided according to the solar wind\nconditions. Here we describe the method in brief. For full\ndetails and justifications of the methods used, see Abel et al.\n[2007].\n[6] The SuperDARN radars [Greenwald et al., 1995;\nChisham et al., 2007] measure the line-of-sight (LOS)\nvelocity of electron density irregularities in the E and\nF region ionosphere aligned along the magnetic field B.\nIn the F-region these irregularities move at the E \u0002 B drift\nvelocity under the influence of the M-I convection electric\nfield E. The radars regularly operate in a common mode, in\nwhich the radars scan through 16 beam directions differing\nby 3.25\u0002 in azimuth with a beam width of \u00035\u0002. For each\nbeam, LOS velocities are measured for 75 range gates using\na pulse length of 300 ms (equivalent to 45 km range\nseparation) and a lag to the first range of 1200 ms (equiv-\nalent to 180 km). A complete scan across 16 beams is\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19102, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040336, 2009\n1British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040336\nL19102 1 of 5\ncompleted in either 60 or 120 s. In this study we use only\ncommon mode data measured by the Halley SuperDARN\nradar in Antarctica during the interval 1996\u20132003 inclusive.\nIn addition, we only use data from the beam aligned along\nthe geomagnetic meridian (beam 8) so as not to complicate\nour analysis by combining data from different look direc-\ntions. We further restrict ourselves to data taken at range\ngate 10 and higher so as to retain only F-region backscatter\nfor which the LOS velocity is a reliable estimate of the\nplasma E \u0002 B drift velocity. Abel et al. [2006] showed that\ndifferent scaling behavior exists poleward and equatorward\nof the open-closed magnetic field line boundary (as deter-\nmined by the C-F spectral width boundary method [Chisham\nand Freeman, 2003]). They also separated the data set into\ndayside (0900\u20131300MLT) and nightside (1800\u20130200MLT)\nsectors. In this study we restrict ourselves to the sector\ncontaining most data, i.e., open magnetic field lines in the\nnightside ionosphere (1800\u20130200 MLT).\n[7] The SuperDARN LOS velocity data are then further\nseparated into eight subgroups according to the IMF direc-\ntion (following the method of Chisham et al. [2009]). That\nis, each subgroup covers a 45\u0002 IMF clock angle region in\nthe GSM Y-Z plane. The IMF clock angle at any time is\nestimated using Weimer-mapped IMF data from the ACE\nspacecraft [Weimer et al., 2002]. In order to calculate\nstructure functions that relate best to particular IMF states\nwe restrict our analysis to relatively stable IMF intervals.\n(This also deals with any problems that occur due to the\nuncertainty in the mapping of highly-variable IMF data).\nWe require that more than 70% of the IMF data in each half-\nhour interval is contained within a single clock angle bin,\nand then assign all ionospheric velocity data from that\ninterval to the corresponding subgroup.\n[8] We calculate the first 3 moments, n, of the structure\nfunctions, Sn(l), of the LOS velocity differences:\nSn l\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc hjv r \u00fe l; t\u00f0 \u00de \u0004 v r; t\u00f0 \u00dejni \u00f01\u00de\nwhere v(r, t) is the LOS velocity measurement made at\nrange r and time t and l is some range separation (in the\nLOS direction). For each radar scan we identify all pairs of\ndata that are present for a given separation l (where l is an\ninteger multiple of the 45 km range gate separation) and\nsubtract the more equatorward measurement of LOS\nvelocity from the more poleward one (v(r + l, t) \u0004 v(r, t))\nand repeat this for all data from all scans in each clock angle\nbin from the 8-year period. This set of velocity fluctuations\nis then conditioned by rejecting all fluctuations larger than\nthree standard deviations, 3sDv(l), from the mean of this\ndistribution [Abel et al., 2007]. We then take the modulus of\nthese values, raise to the power n and average (hjv(r + l, t) \u0004\nv(r, t)jni). This is repeated for range gate separations from 1\n(l = 45 km) to 55 (l = 2475 km). We only show here\nstructure functions of order 3 and less as Abel et al. [2007]\nshowed that higher order calculations were unreliable due to\nvelocity measurement aliasing.\n3. Results\n[9] Figure 1 shows the first three order structure func-\ntions plotted as a function of separation calculated using the\nalgorithm presented above for each of the eight IMF clock\nangle bins. The clock dial in the center of Figure 1 indicates\nthe IMF direction at the center of each bin, and also points\ntoward the plot that relates to that clock angle bin. It should\nbe noted that S2 has been divided by 200 and S3 has been\ndivided by 50,000 in order to show them clearly on the\nsame figure as S1 (it is the shape and slope of the line that\nwe are most interested in, rather than the absolute value).\nEach of the eight panels has a similar form where each of\nthe three structure functions is a power law (i.e., straight line\non a log-log plot) at small separations (<600\u20131000 km) and\ndeviates from this at large separations (>600\u20131000 km).\nThe deviation was attributed by Abel et al. [2006] to the\nglobal 2-cell convection pattern. In support of this, it is\ninteresting to note that the form of the deviation from power\nlaw, whilst similar between the three lines in any one plot,\nvaries between the different clock angle directions.\n[10] As well as the form of the deviation of Sn from\npower law at large separation varying with clock angle, the\nscaling exponents, zn, (i.e., the slopes of the plotted struc-\nture functions) also vary. The red lines in Figure 1 show\nstraight lines fitted to the power law regions of each line\n(using a least-squares fit to the points in log-log space,\nwhere the extent of the fit is selected by eye). The scaling\nexponents of these fitted lines are shown in Figure 2 where\nthe dial plot again indicates the IMF direction at the center\nof each bin. The error bars shown on the points have been\ncalculated from the variation of zn for conditioning between\n2sDv(l) and 4sDv(l), shown by Abel et al. [2007] to be the\nlargest source of error.\n[11] Also shown in Figure 2 are three lines. The solid\nblack line shows the values of zn expected for a mono-fractal\nwith a scaling exponent equal to the measured z1 (shown in\nred), i.e., z = nz1. The dotted red line shows the zn values\npredicted from the mono-fractal Kraichnan-Iroshnikov\n(KI65) model of MHD turbulence, i.e., z = n\/3 (identical\nin all plots). The solid red line shows the zn values predicted\nfrom a multifractal P-model of KI65 turbulence\nzn \u00bc 1\u0004 log2 pn=4 \u00fe 1\u0004 p\u00f0 \u00den=4\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00f02\u00de\nwith the free parameter p determined from z1. This model\nwas shown by Abel et al. [2007] to give the best fit to the\ntotal data set (when not discriminating by IMF clock angle).\nThe reason for using z1 to determine the free parameter in\nthe P-model and the slope of the mono-fractal line is that\nthis is the best defined structure function.\n[12] By comparing the calculated structure functions to\nthe lines shown in Figure 2, we can make the following\nstatements: (1) The mono-fractal line with a scaling expo-\nnent equal to z1 (black) does not describe the data well with\nthe exception of the bin centered around due northward IMF\n(and possibly the \u0004y \u0004z IMF direction). (2) The mono-\nfractal KI65 line (dotted red) does not describe the data well\nfor any bin, again with the exception of the bin centered\naround due northward IMF. (3) The multifractal KI65 line\n(solid red) describes z1 by definition, but also z2 well for all\nbins, and z3 to varying degrees. (iv) In the bin centered\naround due northward IMF all three lines are very similar\nindicating that z1 is very close to the value of 0.25 predicted\nby the mono-fractal KI65 turbulence (i.e., the free parameter\nL19102 ABEL ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC MULTIFRACTALITY L19102\n2 of 5\nin the multifractal KI65 model is such that the multifractality\nis very small).\n4. Discussion\n[13] The results presented above extend the previous\nfindings of Abel et al. [2006, 2007]. At scales <1000 km\nthe structure functions are a power law implying scale-free\nstructure that corresponds to the inertial range of turbulence.\nAt larger scales deviations from the power law are seen\nwhich have been interpreted as being due to the dominance\nof the familiar Dungey convection cells. The new fact that\nthe deviation from a power law varies as a function of IMF\nclock angle supports this view because it is well known that\nthe large scale ionospheric convection varies systematically\nwith IMF clock angle [e.g., Ruohoniemi and Greenwald,\n2005]. It is worth noting that the scaling exponents found\nhere and by Abel et al. [2007] are somewhat larger than\nthose found by Parkinson [2008] in similar regions but in\nthe temporal domain. The two studies may be expected to\nbe equivalent when invoking the Taylor hypothesis, i.e., that\ntemporal and spatial scales are equivalent if the flow over\nthe point of observation is fast compared to the changes in\nthe field. However, this is unlikely to be so in the iono-\nsphere and so we suggest therein lies the reason for the\ndiscrepancy.\n[14] The more significant new result comes from seeing\nhow the scaling exponents zn vary as a function of n for\ndifferent IMF directions. The IMF clock angle directions in\nFigure 2 can be split into two groups: the first is when the\nIMF is directed close to purely northward, and the second is\nall other IMF directions. The values of z1, z2, and z3 for the\npurely northward IMF bin are well described by a mono-\nfractal with a scaling exponent of 0.25. During other IMF\nconditions they are not. Despite this the structure function\nscaling exponents may be broadly described for all IMF\ndirections by a single intermittent turbulence model, the\nmultifractal KI65 model, with varying intermittency such\nthat there is zero intermittency for due northward IMF and\nnon-zero intermittency otherwise. This observation is some-\nwhat contradictory to the work of Parkinson [2006], who,\nusing data from the Halley and TIGER SuperDARN radars,\nfound temporal scaling exponents not to vary significantly\nwhen the data was separated according to whether the IMF\nBz was positive or negative. This apparent paradox is likely\nexplained by the fact that we only find mono-fractal\nstructure for the purely northward IMF bin, and the scaling\nexponents of the other northward IMF bins are indeed\nsimilar to the southward IMF bins. Thus Parkinson\n[2006] did not resolve the IMF finely enough to see the\ndifference we have found.\n[15] It is well known that during periods of southward\nIMF the M-I system is strongly coupled to the solar wind\nFigure 1. The first three order structure functions (S1, S2, and S3) plotted as a function of separation l (S1 diamonds,\nS2 squares, and S3 triangles) for the eight IMF clock angle directions. The central direction of each 45\u0002 clock angle bin is\nshown by the dial in the centre of the figure. For convenience S2 has been divided by 200 and S3 has been divided by\n50,000. The red lines show straight lines fitted to the power law region of each structure function. The figures given in the\ntop left corners indicate the number of data pairs used in the structure function calculation at separations of 45 km and\n900 km.\nL19102 ABEL ET AL.: IONOSPHERIC MULTIFRACTALITY L19102\n3 of 5\nthrough magnetic reconnection between the IMF and the\nmagnetospheric field at latitudes equatorward of the cusp,\ndriving a strong 2-cell convection pattern on the system\nscale [Dungey, 1961]. During northward IMF, reconnection\ncan still occur in the lobe regions but no new open flux is\nadded to the magnetosphere and the extent and strength of\nionospheric convection is much reduced compared to that\nseen during southward IMF with often no clear convection\npattern, especially in the nightside ionosphere. The transi-\ntion to lobe cell reconnection does not happen at \u00b190\u0002 clock\nangle but rather at around \u00b145\u0002 clock angle [e.g., Freeman\net al., 1993] coincident with the transition to zero intermit-\ntency in ionospheric turbulence. With this basic picture we\ncan suggest various reasons for the variation of multi-\nfractality with IMF.\n[16] Our favoured interpretation follows that of Abel et\nal. [2006], i.e., that the scale-free structure exhibited in the\npolar ionospheric plasma flow is inherited from the solar\nwind driving it. When the M-I system is strongly coupled to\nthe IMF the intermittency in the ionosphere is inherited\ndirectly from the solar wind. However, the symmetry of the\nturbulence is changed as it is transmitted from the solar\nwind to the ionosphere due to the stronger mean magnetic\nfield. In the solar wind with a relatively weak mean field the\nturbulence is described by an intermittent K41 model [e.g.,\nPagel and Balogh, 2001], whereas in the ionosphere with a\nstrong mean field it is converted to intermittent KI65\nturbulence. In the non-driven case of purely northward\nIMF the ionosphere is decoupled from the solar wind and\nionospheric turbulence is effectively freely decaying and\ndoes not inherit any intermittency.\n[17] Another possible interpretation is that the intermit-\ntency only arises when a global convection pattern is estab-\nlished and arises due to the turbulence being constrained by\nthe size of the system. For example a 2-dimensional\nnumerical simulation of an inverse turbulent cascade\nshowed that intermittency only became present once vorti-\nces on the scale size of the simulation were established\n[Smith and Yakhot, 1993]. In this case multifractality need\nnot necessarily come from the solar wind but rather could be\ninherent to the ionosphere itself.\n[18] A third possibility is that the intermittency is inho-\nmogeneous relative to the local mean ionospheric flow\ndirection. The SuperDARN radars measure only the LOS\ncomponent of the velocity and so the structure function\ncomprises an unknown mixture of longitudinal and trans-\nverse fluctuations. During periods of southward IMF there\nis a strongly defined convection pattern and given the MLT\nsector under study most measurements made are along the\ndirection of the mean flow. During periods of northward\nIMF there is no dominant average flow direction (especially\nin the nightside ionosphere) and so the orientation of our\nobservations is distinctly different for these conditions.\nHowever, numerical simulations of turbulence have shown\nsmaller intermittency for longitudinal than for transverse\nfluctuations [e.g., Grossmann et al., 1997], which would be\nFigure 2.

Conclusions\n[19] We have presented a structure function analysis of\n8 years of LOS ionospheric plasma velocity data measured\nby the Halley SuperDARN radar sorted according to the\nIMF clock angle. We find that the plasma velocity fluctua-\ntions are consistent with intermittent Kraichnan-Iroshnikov\nturbulence for all clock angles and that the intermittency\ndecreases to zero during purely northward IMF conditions.\nWe suggest that the intermittency disappears during periods\nof purely northward IMF as this is when coupling between\nthe solar wind and the magnetosphere\/ionosphere effectively\nswitches off, and that thus the intermittency is inherited\nfrom the solar wind.\n[20] Acknowledgments.
