By taking a long-\nterm view of these developments in the twentieth century, and by comparing the\nexperiences of two different sets of institutions, the article highlights the strategic\nfactors that influenced the decisions taken by senior managers in their transformation\nof British retail financial services.4\nI\nSince their origins in the late seventeenth century, financial intermediaries working in\nBritish retail banking markets have undergone a sustained and continuous process of\nchange that has altered their nature, size, structure and behaviour. In the last century\nthey have also been the location of significant technological change \u2013 though as the\nlocus of the diffusion of new technology rather than the development of novel\nmachinery. And by their application of waves of new technology, financial interme-\ndiaries have adapted to change both what they do and how they do it.5\nInevitably, the nature of mechanisation and the type of technology introduced to\nachieve \u2018modernity\u2019 is a significant part of this article. However, our tale is not one of\ntechnological determinism. Rather, we believe that banks and building societies\nendeavoured to assess the costs and benefits associated with the adoption of new tech-\nnologies and to act appropriately given their perceptions of the business environ-\nment.6 This altered significantly as the economic, social, political and cultural\nlandscape was transformed by a number of factors, including the much expanded\nrole of the state; the impact of war; changing perceptions of gender; and the develop-\nment of a large managerial class and its increased professionalism. Although new tech-\nnology underpins these developments, these additional themes also enlighten our\nstory.\nIt is clear that, throughout the twentieth century, British financial institutions\nassessed practices abroad, though considerations of space preclude a detailed inter-\nnational comparison here. Similarly, as a central element of our story concerns the\nconsolidation of national systems of corporate co-ordination and control, these pro-\ncesses occurred across the country rather than being uniquely located. Hence, the dif-\nfusion of the managerial procedures, techniques and associated technological\ninnovations occurred within institutions that operated across geographical space. In\nshort, our story highlights the longevity of technological change in retail finance.\n4 Peter Wardley, \u2018The commercial banking industry and its part in the emergence and consolidation of\nthe corporate economy in Britain before \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf643\u2019, Journal of Industrial History, \uf646. \uf645 (\uf645\uf643\uf643\uf643), pp. \uf64a\uf644\u2013\uf64c\uf64a.\n5 Ibid.\n6 Richard Coopey arrived at a different conclusion as he considered that banks \u2018in the US or in Britain\nconsidered direct costs a minor factor of purchasing systems\u2026. [they] had little, if any, accurate idea of\nthe cost-benefits of computing\u2019. \u2018A passing technology: the automated teller machine\u2019, in P. Lyth and\nH. Trischler (eds.), Wiring Prometheus: Globalisation, History and Technology (Aarhus, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf647), p. \uf644\uf64b\uf645.\nBERNARDO B\u00c1TIZ-LAZO AND PETER WARDLEY\uf644\uf64a\uf64b\nGiven the prominence we give to directors and managers as agents of change, gov-\nernment is allotted here a relatively minor role. Although much can be made of the\nrelative importance of the US and UK governments as sponsors of strategic computer\nhardware and associated applications, we emphasise the process of change that saw\nbook-keeping and internal control brought about within clearing banks and building\nsocieties by office mechanisation.7 In particular, our story tells how technology in the\nform of office mechanisation and mechanical accounting (including computer appli-\ncations) was introduced in the search for increasingly efficient book-keeping and\ninternal control practices. Here there is an apparent contradiction. On the one\nhand, those financial intermediaries at the vanguard of technological change explored\nand adapted new applications to exploit existing operations as well as developing new\ncapabilities. On the other hand, directors and senior managers of these intermediaries\nretainedmany of their internal practices largely unchanged as automation changed the\nexecution of existing routine practices rather than first principles. Furthermore, devel-\nopments in management control and cost accounting techniques were seldom adver-\ntised outside the industry. As a result, it is not surprising that external commentators\nsometimes accused clearing banks and, subsequently, building societies of managerial\n\u2018backwardness\u2019.\nI I\nThe process of office mechanisation in clearing banks and building societies can be\nseen as a significant element of managerial practice that implemented a strategic inter-\nvention associated with management cost accounting. In a wider context, J. R.\nEdwards is among those who argue that some economic and business historians\nmay have underestimated the development and impact of cost or management\naccountancy over the last two centuries.8 In similar fashion, R. Kee pointed to the\nscarcity of studies exploring mechanical and electromechanical devices in accounting\nhistory.9 While this research, for the most part, has concentrated on the manufactur-\ning sector, here it is suggested that such a restricted view is unwarranted.10 Broadening\nthis investigation to encompass institutions that provided services, and financial ser-\nvices in particular, shows clearly the recurrent appraisal of these techniques that\ninformed implementation.\n7 Respectively Jon Agar, The Government Machine: a Revolutionary History of the Computer (Cambridge,\nMA, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf646); S.

First, these manifested themselves in a number of official documents:\ntheMacmillan Report (\uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf64c); the Radcliffe Report (\uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c); the National Board for Prices and\nIncomes\u2019Report on Bank Charges (\uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64a); theMonopolies Commission ruling on the pro-\nposed merger of Lloyds Bank, Barclays Bank and Martin\u2019s Bank (\uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64b); and the\nCruickshank Report (\uf645\uf643\uf643\uf643). All criticised clearing banks, and perhaps by implication\nother financial institutions, including building societies, for a systemic failure to\nprovide adequate venture capital to finance British industry. Furthermore, the more\nrecent of these reports opined that these institutions had inadequate, if not poor, internal\ncontrol practices. Second, similar views critical of the lack of sophistication in manage-\nment accounting in banks and building societies have been expressed in various recent\nacademic studies.11 Hence, with regard to managerial practices in British banks, it is not\ndifficult to locate both implicit and explicit accusations of \u2018backwardness\u2019.12\nTo some extent, clearing banks were responsible for the currency of these accusa-\ntions as they failed to present their case to the authorities successfully.13 However,\nthese indictments raise a number of questions regarding the expertise of those\nmaking the allegations, the criteria by which backwardness could be identified, the\nnature and quality of the supporting evidence, and the degree and extent of back-\nwardness exhibited. These questions need to be answered in the context of the dom-\ninating view that guided banking regulation at the time of each enquiry, as well as\ncontemporaneous corporate practices in banking current in the UK and elsewhere.\nReflecting on this theme, this article contributes to the view which rejects the ortho-\ndox pessimistic position.14 That is, it abjures an assessment which affirms that the\n11 Bernardo B\u00e1tiz-Lazo and Trevor Boyns, \u2018Automation and management accounting in British man-\nufacturing and retail financial services, \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf648\u2013\uf649\uf64b\u2019, paper presented at the Information Systems and\nTechnology in Organisations and Society, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf646; C.

In particular, we discuss, to compare and contrast, the experience of\nenterprises in two initially distinct sectors within retail financial services: first, the\nretail operations of the clearing banks and, second, building societies. This allows\nus to highlight the common elements that characterise the process of technological\ndiffusion that occurred in stages associated with different time periods, the adoption\nof early generations of IT, and within different institutions.\nI I I\nClearly identifiable during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the\nhistory of British banking was the development of systems required to control\nand co-ordinate the business of a financial company which was conducted by a\ngrowing number of banking offices, retail branches or outlets, directed and supervised\nfrom a central office, the bank\u2019s headquarter offices. There were two fundamental\naspects shared by each and every system of bank control developed during this\nperiod: first, the establishment of clearly specified and supervised routines which\ndetermined the organisation and nature of day-to-day business; and, second, the\nimposition of these established routines upon newly acquired, and previously inde-\npendent, components of an amalgamated bank. In the latter case, the senior officers\nand directors of a bank would evaluate the strategic policy of the amalgamated bank to\nensure control over lending and borrowing and establish the terms upon which\nbusiness would be undertaken and, then, they would ensure their control over the\nimplementation of this strategy by insisting on adherence to closely specified practices\nand protocols. Several features of this management system that ensured central\ncommand of resources can be identified. They include the provision and identifi-\ncation of premises where business would be conducted; the stipulation of the hours\nduring which a retail branch would be open for business; \u2018draconian\u2019 inspection\nand internal audit policies and procedures; the creation of an internal labour\nmarket, which required the implementation of career structures; and, most important\nof all, the designation of power and authority within a retail branch network.15\nAn essential feature of this system, designed to ensure direction of a retail branch\nremote from the central offices, was the establishment of universally applied accounting\nprocedureswhich ensured both the observation and the direction of retail branch activity.\nUsually, the direction and supervision of these managerial and accounting procedures\nwere achieved by a strict insistence that the recording and transmission of information\nwere undertaken according to a standardised format. For the senior officers of late\n15 Wardley, \u2018The commercial banking industry\u2019.\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN UK BANKING \uf644\uf64b\uf644\nnineteenth-century banks in Britain, rapid and convenient access to comprehensive data\nwhich was accurate, recent and recurrent was essential to conduct their management of\nthe enterprise. One manifestation of this was the growing collection of ledgers, each laid\nout to a specific and specified design tomeet a particular purpose, heldwhile in use by the\nretail branch and, later, on completion, by the head offices of each bank. Anotherwas the\ncustomised stationery designed tomeet the requirements of communication internal and\nexternal to the bank. Additionally, the corresponding or equivalent records, which\nallowed the documentation of the progress of the whole enterprise, were constructed\nat the head office to allow both supervision and command of all the resources available.\nThese systems, while obviously not perfect, were nevertheless highly successful in allow-\ning both the observation and direction of ever growing financial institutions.16\nThe first two decades of the twentieth century saw great changes in the equipping\nof bank offices as new technology, embodied in telephones, typewriters, pneumatic\ncommunication tubes, photographic records, steel filing cabinets and electric lighting,\nbecame more common. As one expert opined, \u2018It may nowadays be said, without\nexaggeration, that machines and devices exist for handling the routine side of\nalmost every kind of clerical work involved in banking, from opening the envelopes\nin the morning mail to sealing them up and stamping them for the evening mail.\u201917\nOne such innovation saw the adoption of the adding machine which could\nperform many essential but routine functions of basic arithmetic that were the\nnorm for the overwhelming majority of operations undertaken in a bank. Within a\nyear of its introduction in \uf644\uf64c\uf643\uf644, the Burroughs Adding Machine was being used in\nBritish banks for straight listing and casting and it was soon appreciated that this,\nand similar machines, provided an effective means to enter regular dividend payments,\nand then lists of entries and debits to customers\u2019 accounts. By the early \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s the\nadding machine was well established as a standard item of equipment at the Big\nFive\u2019s head offices and in larger branches.\nOf much greater significance for the determination of business strategy and bank\norganisation was the introduction of accounting machines, which had the capacity to\nrecord and store operations. Ledger Posting Machines made possible the mechanisation\nof customer accounts, rendering them more legible, more accurate and more efficient\nthan the pass books that had previously been the accepted technology.18 At theMidland\nBank they were first introduced in the Overseas Branch, a discrete department within\nthe bank which facilitated trial (and error), in \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf649 to produce the balances on accounts.\nThe results of this experiment were sufficiently promising for theMidland to plan a pro-\ngramme for the introduction of ledger posting machines throughout the bank. By the\nend of \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf64a these machines had been further developed, by the addition of a proof strip\nor tally roll, which automatically recorded every item entered, so that the totals of debits\n16 Ibid.\n17 F.

An important\nfeature of this facility was that it provided security in the form of an independent\nmeans of cross-checking the record of financial transactions.19\nTheWestminster Bank installed its first accounting machine at the Leicester branch\nin \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf64c. This began a process of mechanisation of book-keeping at its retail branches\nby which machine-prepared statements replaced customers\u2019 handwritten passbooks.\nAlthough the first of the banks to complete its mechanisation project, it was only\nin \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf649 that Westminster was able to celebrate the inclusion of every one of its\n\uf644,\uf645\uf643\uf643 branches; this event was marked at an informal ceremony when the\nfinal accounting machine (aNational class \uf646\uf643\uf643\uf643) was delivered to head office by execu-\ntives of the National Cash Register Company (NCR).20\nElectromechanical machine technology also facilitated the development of centra-\nlised registers which recorded the financial position, exposure and recent history of the\nbank and its component parts. Furthermore, it provided significant cost savings,\nthrough the substitution of relatively dear male labour by the relatively inexpensive\ncombination of female labour and machines.21 While the significance and impact\nof machine banking is further developed below, it is important to note that its intro-\nduction was both earlier and more pervasive than is recognised in some of the recent\nliterature that records this development: often the introduction of banking machinery\nis mentioned without reference to its broader significance for bank organisation; alter-\nnatively the introduction of banking machinery is dated erroneously from the end of\nthe \uf644\uf64c\uf646\uf643s, the late \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf643s or even the \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643s.22\nOne example will suffice to demonstrate both the nature and maturity of this\nprocess.

Fourthly, it is sig-\nnificant that the editorial preface to this survey reveals that senior Barclays\u2019 staff, who\nwould readily have admitted that the bank was a relative laggard in the adoption of\nthis new technology, assumed that staff at the majority of their branches already\nhad some acquaintance with the new technology. Fifthly, and finally, his article\ndemonstrates an informed and profound awareness of the implications of bank mech-\nanisation, defined broadly to encompass a full range of a clearing bank\u2019s operations. As\nEllis wrote:\nThe modern bank organiser does not buy machines merely because they are a novelty, or just\nsurround himself with machinery. On the contrary, he works to a very definite and logical\nplan. He studies the transactions and material the bank \u2013 in the department or branch he is\ninvestigating \u2013 is called upon to handle, having regard to volume, frequency of \u2018peak loads\u2019\nand so forth. Thence he turns to the shape in which the results are desired. He must pay atten-\ntion, also, to the various points to be covered in arriving at those results. All the while he keeps\nin mind the general lines of the bank\u2019s policy and the requirements and satisfaction of the\nclientele. These are the conditions under which he draws up his plan to provide the desired\nresults as quickly, as economically and as efficiently as possible. Having made the outline of\nhis plan, he next selects the machines and devices which, in his judgement, will best aid the\nstaff in the consummation of the scheme.24\nIt is most telling that, as early as \uf644\uf64c\uf646\uf644, a senior manager in the bank which itself\naccepted that it was the slowest in the \u2018Big Five\u2019 convoy en route to mechanisation\nwas writing about this process, employing such telling phrases as: \u2018the modern\nbank organiser\u2019, \u2018general lines of the bank\u2019s policy\u2019, \u2018logical plan\u2019, \u2018consummation\nof the scheme\u2019, \u2018efficiently\u2019 and so on.\nIn the late \uf644\uf64c\uf646\uf643s, after a brief pause when the depths of the international recession\ncoincided with a period of consolidation, the \u2018Big Five\u2019 high street banks recom-\nmenced their drive to mechanised banking, with the minimum threshold of\nbranch size being set at lower and lower limits. Interestingly, given the debate\nabout the limited impact of managerial accounting upon strategic decision making,\nthis assessment was informed by detailed information concerning standardised gauges\nof branch size and performance. These indicators included the numberof staff, accounts,\nand transactions, financial resources and profitability. Even in smaller retail branches,\nwhere mechanical banking was viewed as uneconomic, at least one of the clearing\nbanks aimed at the extension of mechanisation with the objective of achieving ration-\nalisation and standardisation.However, the economic effects ofWorldWar II and its dire\neconomic aftermath, both exacerbated by a stringent foreign exchange shortage, put a\nbrake on further bank mechanisation and this halt to further diffusion lasted until the\nexisting technology was approaching the end of its effective lifespan.\n24 Ellis, \u2018New lamps for old: part I\u2019.\nBERNARDO B\u00c1TIZ-LAZO AND PETER WARDLEY\uf644\uf64b\uf647\nIV\nMechanisation of accounting functions indicated how clearing banks and building\nsocieties, like their counterparts in the USA, were anticipating an increased workload\nresulting from the greatly increased number of personal accounts which would follow\nfrom the projected increase in wage payments made by cheque. Without mechanis-\nation this increased workload would require even larger numbers of employees\nwhich, taken with increasing unionisation amongst bank workers and generally\nrising wages, implied a significant rise in costs. It is worth noting that the initial adop-\ntion of new technology in banks had been closely associated with the recruitment of\nfemale bank clerks. Females were perceived as more proficient in the use of keyboards\nand awarded significantly lower rates of compensation. This transformation of the\nbank as a working environment during the interwar years was followed after \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643\nby building societies. There were other causes here, including relative rates of pay,\nchanged social attitudes to women\u2019s work and the residual impact of recruitment\nof women in both World Wars, which ensured that gender was a factor that influ-\nenced both the adoption of machine banking in the late \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s and the post-\uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643\nadoption of computers.25 But as had been the case with their counterparts in the\nUSA, British banks were feeling the strain of a high turnover of female clerical\nworkers, particularly in London and Birmingham.26 In such circumstances,\nChannon argues that banks \u2018turned gratefully to computers, which could be used\nto handle routine business and increase the strained capacity of many small [retail]\nbranches\u2019.27 Computerisation reduced costs and \u2018helped towards a slow but steady\nreduction in the number of [retail bank] branches\u2019.28 Significantly, at this time the build-\ning societies, still at a different stage of the mechanisation process, employed computers\nto continue to expand their networks of retail branches, which were now increasingly\nreplacing agents as the primary point of contact with their customers.29\nThe \u2018Big Five\u2019 clearing banks had recognised the potential of \u2018mechanical banking\u2019\nto overhaul management structures and introduce new systems of management\ncontrol as early as the \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s. Their responses to these opportunities were often\nimplemented as local initiatives designed to meet internal needs, though American\npractice was influential. In the \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643s British banks and building societies were simi-\nlarly aware of developments in the design of new technology and its application\n25 Wardley, \u2018Women, mechanization and cost-savings\u2019.\n26 Alan E.

As with their earlier experiences with mechanisation, the\nimplementation of computer technology resulted in the adoption of distinctive\norganisational solutions in the UK.30 International, inter-organisational and intra-\norganisational differences, however, tended to dissolve as the diffusion of technol-\nogical change produced some convergence of practice.31\nIn the USA, during the \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s banks experienced a period of growth that continued\nin spite of the Great Depression although, unlike England, this growth was not\nreflected in the expansion of retail branch networks, which were prohibited by\nlaw, and US banks remained relatively small by British standards. An indicator of\nthis growth of banking business in the USA was the increasing number of paper-\nbased transactions. Yavitz estimated that approximately one and a half billion\ncheques were cleared in \uf644\uf64c\uf646\uf64c, and this volume increased to \uf649.\uf648 billion in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643 and\nto \uf644\uf646 billion in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643.32 Consequently, \u2018the spectacular rise in cheque volume and\nactivity, with no corresponding increase in the value of deposits, placed a severe\nstrain on the [American] banking system\u2019.33 By the early \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643s this had become a criti-\ncal problem and, as cheque clearing was expected to continue to grow, the banks\nrecognised the need for a specialised mechanical aid: a cheque-reading machine\nthat mechanised this important accounting function.\nHowever, in the decade that followed the end of World War II, although compu-\nter manufacturers saw profitable business to be obtained from applications sold to the\nmilitary, commercial aircraft manufacturers, research laboratories and industrial users\nof advanced mathematics and statistics, they were unwilling to invest in a system that\nwould help in the proof reading and book-keeping of cheques.34 Consequently,\nbanks led this field when the Bank of America approached the Stanford Research\nInstitute to design and eventually build a prototype. This required the interconnec-\ntion of tabulating machines, sorters, punched-card readers and hybrid computing\ntechnology; and combining transistors, vacuum tubes and operational amplifiers.\nThis system, Electronic Recording Machine-Accounting (ERMA), required some\n$\uf644\uf643 m and three years of work and was launched in September \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf648.\n30 Wardley, \u2018The commercial banking industry\u2019.\n31 Bernardo B\u00e1tiz-Lazo and Douglas Wood, \u2018Management of core capabilities in Mexican and\nEuropean banks\u2019, International Journal of Service Industry Management (Special issue on Service\nManagement in Latin America), \uf644\uf643. \uf648 (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf64c), pp. \uf647\uf646\uf643\u2013\uf647\uf64b; B.

The new system left procedures for\norganisational control or identifying the profitability of individual services\nunchanged. The efforts of the Bank of America and the Stanford Research\nInstitute, however, did change the banking industry when other banks built their\npractices around innovations associated with ERMA. In particular, the Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s magnetic character recognition patents became the standard when electro-\nmechanical clearing of cheques was adopted by the American Bankers Association\n(ABA) between \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf647 and \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643.35 Later this would also be true for credit card\nstandards.\nThe ABA standards, with minor adaptations, were also adopted in the UK.\nAlthough an early history of mechanisation at the clearing house has yet to\nemerge, links to developments in the USA and the importance of mechanical aids\nto this process are indisputable: the Electronics Sub-Committee of the Committee\nof London Clearing Banks was set up in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf648. This was a major force in the\nprocess leading to automation, and was chaired and run by \u2018Barclays men\u2019, who\nwere also delegated to oversee the talks at the ABA. Later Barclays Bank and\nMartins Bank pioneered the use of computers by opening dedicated centres for\nbranch book-keeping. Although it took from \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf644 to \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf647 for Barclays to put all\nits retail bank branches \u2018on-line\u2019, without this development it would have been\nimpossible for Barclays to introduce its network of automatic teller machines (ATM)\nin the mid \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf643s.36\nAutomation also took place within the Bank of England with the introduction of\nPower-Samas tabulators to assist in the payment of dividends in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf644.37 In February\n\uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf648 initial steps were taken to establish what was to become the Audit Department\u2019s\nComputer Division.38 Together with the Organization and Methods Department,\nthis group spearheaded the uncontroversial introduction of an ICL \uf644\uf646\uf643\uf64c (working\nin tandem with an IBM \uf646\uf649\uf643) to replace the tabulators in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64a. By contrast, the\nmigration of War bonds to magnetic tape storage gave rise to an internal debate (mir-\nroring one amongst City auditors) as to what, in the face of the increasing computer-\nisation of activities, could be regarded as acceptable from an audit point of view.39 The\nBank of England\u2019s concerns about the audit of electronic media resulted in\nJ.

In his original invitation Jensen noted that:\nIt occurred to us that your studies in the computer area of auditing work, an area which is\nrelatively new to all of us, might be advanced \u2026 [A visit], I think, can be more productive\nthan communication by mail, particularly when the subject is novel and complex as the\none we are considering, i.e., the potentialities of the computer for internal control and audit-\ning purposes.40\nAlthough computerised accounting was in its infancy at the Federal Reserve, Jensen\nindicated his expectation that computers would bring about important changes in\nprocesses, procedures and organisational capabilities. The four-day visit took place\nin September \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64a and besides electronic data processing, topics included \u2018the\nscope of the various audits, the recruitment and training of staff, operational audits,\nand statistical sampling techniques\u2019.41\nThe frank and open exchange between Jensen and de M. Rudolf mirrored a long-\nestablished exchange of information between London andNewYork.42 British banks\nand the larger building societies were also watchful of developments in automation\nand the introduction of computer power in the USA. For instance, the development\nof electronic book-keeping methods that used computers in banking prompted the\nvisit of A.M.MacGregor, manager of theMidland Bank\u2019s Machine Department (sig-\nnificantly renamed Operations and Methods in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf644), to the USA in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf649.43 Senior\nmanagers of building societies also learned of developments in computer technology\nfrom directors who had visited the facilities of computer manufacturers and reported\non developments in the mechanisation of accounting at savings and loans institutions\nin the USA.44\nV\nAccording to Channon, in the late \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643s and early \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643s UK computer manufac-\nturers had an incentive to enter the market for commercial applications because\nbanks and other financial service organisations began to invest heavily in the\ncomputerisation of its processes and procedures.45 Indicative of this was the installa-\ntion of an IBM \uf644\uf647\uf643\uf644 in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c by the Bank of Scotland.46 Another more general\n40 BoEA, ADF: letter from J.

In postwar Britain Powers-\nSamas was the main supplier of accounting machinery to the clearing banks.49\nAlthough Powers-Samas had expertise in the development of devices to handle\npunch-cards and could see the commercial potential of a cheque reader, it recognised\nthat the development of this technology was beyond its own resources. In an attempt\nto remain a major force in the sector the chairman of Powers-Samas, Col. A. T.\nMaxwell, arranged a secret and historic meeting with British Tabulating Machine\nCompany Limited (BTM) in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf649 that resulted in the establishment of a joint\nworking party to determine a strategy for a joint venture in bank mechanisation.\nThis initiative proved to be the first step towards a merger of the two companies as\nInternational Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c.50 By \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64b BTM\nhad developed, in conjunction with an undisclosed American firm, a large-scale com-\nputer for use in banks and similar organisations.51 By contrast, Lyons\u2019 LEO II was sold\nto industry for general data processing, while Ferranti\u2019s Pegasus II found users amongst\nfinancial service organisations, including Martins Bank.52\n47 Woolwich Equitable Building Society [henceforth WEBS], \u2018Brief Report on Automation\u2019 [hence-\nford BRA], Barclays Group Archives, Manchester, \uf647 April \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643, Ref. \uf644\uf647\uf647.\n48 The B.\uf644\uf643\uf644 Sorter-Reader was a high-speed digital sorter, primarily intended to be used by banks for\nsorting cheques and credit slips into branch and account number before posting.

At the Woolwich\nEquitable Building Society (Woolwich), for instance, the decision to invest\n\u00a3\uf645\uf643\uf643,\uf643\uf643\uf643 in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643 in computer equipment led to considerations of a tailor-made\nsystem, specifically the adaptation of STC\u2019s Stantec Zebra transistorised computer\nwith paper tape reader and Creed \uf644\uf643\uf643\uf643 printer.53 The Woolwich also considered\nmachines produced by companies at the forefront of computer technology including\nNCR, ICT (Hollerith-Powers) and IBM.\nFerranti equipment was notable because, instead of using the magnetic characters\nthat characterised Burroughs equipment, information was read into the computer on\nperforated or magnetised tape to be stored in \u2018memory drums\u2019. Account statements\nand other information could then be produced very speedily, as and when required.\nDespite this apparent strength, Ferranti\u2019s directors foresaw insufficient demand to\njustify substantial investments in production facilities or persist with the development\nof mainframe computers. When faced with a liquidity problem Ferranti, a family-\nowned firm, decided to abandon commercial computers and focus its resources on\ndefence sectors. As a result, Ferranti lost its lead in mainframe computers for\ngeneral commercial use and mainframe computers were finally divested in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf646.54\nMeanwhile, in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf644 Barclays demonstrated the viability of the new computer tech-\nnology by successfully introducing an EMIDEC \uf644\uf644\uf643\uf643 to process the accounts of its\nPall Mall district which operated \uf647\uf643,\uf643\uf643\uf643 accounts. This proved to be the first step\nin the process of diffusion of computerisation throughout Barclays. Shortly after,\nmanagers introduced what proved to be an over-ambitious scheme to mechanise\nall banking activities with a system built around a Burroughs \uf64b\uf648\uf643\uf643. For British\nbanks this was a rare example of a bold venture at the cutting edge of technological\nprogress, and onewhich demonstrated the benefits of the alternative, and quickly vin-\ndicated, strategy of adopting promptly technology which was already tried and tested.\nAlthough the careers of the senior managers involved were not damaged by this\nadventure, a further demonstration of sound judgement on the bank\u2019s part concern-\ning the nature of business strategy, the lesson provided by this experiment was not lost\non Barclays\u2019 competitors.55\nFurther developments, in both the financial services offered and the information\ntechnology used to deliver these services, followed apace among all the major\nbanks. A year later, the Westminster Bank, true to its tradition as an interwar trailbla-\nzer, became in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf645 the first UK bank to provide its customers with cheques printed\nto include machine-readable information which facilitated automatic sorting.\n53 The Chairman of the Woolwich was also Chairman of STC and, not surprisingly, pushed the former\nto link up with STC but, in the end, theWoolwich\u2019s Accountant and STC\u2019s engineers recommended\nagainst it.\n54 John F.Wilson, \u2018International business strategies at Ferranti, \uf644\uf64c\uf643\uf64a\u2013\uf64a\uf648: directionmanagement and per-\nformance\u2019, Business History, \uf647\uf643. \uf644 (\uf644\uf64c\uf64c\uf64b), pp. \uf644\uf643\uf643\u2013\uf645\uf644.\n55 Ackrill and Hannah, Barclays.\nBERNARDO B\u00c1TIZ-LAZO AND PETER WARDLEY\uf644\uf64c\uf643\nBy adoption of this advanced, but not pioneering, information technology the\nWestminster Bank was able to centralise further accounting functions which had\nremained at retail branches. The pace of adoption, and the nature of the developments\ntaking place in parallel in the banking industry, was demonstrated within twelve\nmonths when Coutts & Co, a private bank owned by the National Provincial\nBank, another of the \u2018Big Five\u2019 English high street banks, adopted a fully compu-\nterised accounting system which encompassed all of its branches.56 The adoption\nof a fully integrated system at Coutts also demonstrated well three other points:\nfirst, that bank size was not the only determinant of adoption of new technology,\nthe private bank was but a fraction of the size of its parent; second, that the\nNational Provincial, again continuing a tradition established in the \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s, was\nable to trial new technology in a constituent bank; and, third, as Coutts was a\nLondon-based bank that conducted most of its business in the capital, that even in\n\uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf646 provision of a networked system was easier to achieve within a region than\nwas the delivery of a comprehensive national service.\nIn summary, during the three decades that followed World War II, British banks\nbegan to plan for and implement the introduction of computers. This second stage\nof bank mechanisation can be characterised as an evolutionary story of assessment,\ninnovation, and diffusion, followed by reappraisal and further innovation.\nVI\nBuilding societies followed clearing banks and manufacturing firms in the sequential\nintroduction of office equipment, punched card technology, tabulating machines\nand, most latterly, computers. However, amongst the building societies the diffusion\nof office technology was quite diverse, with leadership provided by the larger insti-\ntutions. Table \uf644 offers in summary form a profile of selected building societies and\nindicates the timing and nature of their initial major investment in computing tech-\nnology. Amongst the building societies the diffusion of computer technology took\nsome twenty years, with the largest institutions the early adopters and the smaller\nones the laggards. Interestingly, evidence has yet to emerge that would reveal the\nextent to which building societies sought to share costs through either jointly\nowned or independent computer bureaus (such as those offered by the Post Office\nand powered by ICL machines; and Westminster Bank\u2019s shared accounting service\nfor societies at Centre-File Ltd). Manual, paper-based administrative systems (aided\nby visible record technology such as the Burroughs Sensitronic F\uf647\uf645\uf643\uf643 or NCR \uf648\uf643\uf643\nSeries) could have prevailed amongst some of the laggards until the late \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf643s or\neven the \uf644\uf64c\uf64b\uf643s, when personal computers were adopted.\nAn early pioneer in the sector, the Co-operative Permanent Building Society\n(CPBS) acquired its first tabulating machines from BTM in \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf647.

In \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf649, individual account control was devolved to staff at retail\nbranches and this was accompanied by the purchase of \uf644\uf645 additional adding and\nlisting machines to support the growing network of branches and agents. However,\nit was only after \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf644 that the potential of these machines, as well as of punch-hole\n\u2018accounting\u2019 machines purchased in \uf644\uf64c\uf647\uf648, was fully exploited when the building\nsocieties experienced significant expansion as a result of policies introduced by the\nConservative Government to encourage home ownership.57\nThe CPBS and other societies, including the Provincial and NALGO (National\nand Local Government Officers\u2019 Association), used a combination of the Hollerith\n\uf64b\uf643-column card system and electronic equipment to generate monthly ledgers.\nWhereas Hollerith cards were processed by electrical contacts, Powers-Samas\nmachines processed cards by \u2018feeling\u2019 punches with small rods. The electronic and\npunch card technology used by the latter was preferred at the Alliance Building\nSociety, one of the largest ten societies (by assets). Mechanisation at the Alliance is\na good example of how the introduction of calculating machines resulted in the sub-\nstitution of sorters and sorter readers for manual clerical work to prepare monthly and\ndaily ledgers.\nIn \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64a the Alliancewas described as \u2018an experienced user of punched cards to gen-\nerate monthly ledgers for individual retail branches\u2019.58 Forty-column cards (with\nseparable mortgage accounting cards for cash, balances, monthly debits and annual\ninsurance debits) were created from a combination of summary listings (\u2018till sheets\u2019)\nand individual slips. Before processing, the cards were checked by a special team of\nclerical staff who confirmed that credits were mortgage repayments and debits had\nthe correct account number and identifier. Instead of a \u2018check digit\u2019 the Alliance\nused the first three letters of the borrower\u2019s or depositor\u2019s surname. This was deemed\nof great assistance to ensure that the cash card was married to the correct balance\ncard before posting.59 Confirmation was necessary because a full listing of account\nnumbers was not always available for staff at retail branches. Following procedure,\nstaff at the branch would add the address of the individual member to a credit or\ndebit slip. At each one of the society\u2019s retail branches, credits to a member\u2019s (i.e.\ncustomer\u2019s) account had to be matched to a cheque, deposit slip at a clearing bank or\ndeposit slip.\nCards were then passed at a rate of up to \uf649,\uf643\uf643\uf643 per hour through each stage of the\nsystem, namely, conversion to punched card, tabulator, collator, calculator and\nposting transfer interpreter. Interest warrants would be printed on continuous station-\nery, which was imprinted first by the addressed system and subsequently by the\n57 B\u00e1tiz-Lazo, \u2018Depreciation of buildings in mutual financial services, circa \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c\u2019.\n58 WEBS, Electronic Accounting [henceforth EA]; Ref \uf644 The use of electronic and punched card\naccounting equipment by building societies, c.\uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64a.\n59 WEBS, Visit to the Alliance Building Society\u2019s Punch Card Accounting Installation [Visit to the\nAlliance]: Ref \uf644: Practical points applicable to any punched card system, \uf648 April \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64a.\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN UK BANKING \uf644\uf64c\uf646\nPowers tabulator (which would also leave a trace through punched paper tape.)\nHowever, interest was not calculated by the tabulator. Interest for long-term deposits\n(\u2018share interest\u2019) was calculated half yearly by the branches and checked at head office\n(\u2018Chief Office\u2019). Mortgage balances were tabulated and sent to an outside advisory\nagency where the annual interest was calculated and noted on the card for return\nto the society where the interest was punched.\nWhen the addresses had been printed on the forms, these were called over with a\ntabulation of current balance cards. After \u2018call-over\u2019, the balance cards were arranged\nin the same order as the addressed warrants. The addressed warrants were then fed into\nthe machine with the cards and, automatically, the account number and capital and\ninterest amounts were printed. The warrants were then checked and initialled, the\nchecker\u2019s duties being limited to verification that the account numbers in the\naddress section and the financial section agreed. The Alliance had three mortgage\npayment dates: the first, second and third Tuesdays in the month and, consequently,\nthree posting dates. All the cards for each posting date were fed through the tabulator\nfor posting at one time and there was a monthly arrears debit for every account.\nThe Alliance ran term deposits (\u2018investments\u2019) and mortgages through different\nequipment. Burroughs equipment was initially used and then Powers-Samas intro-\nduced for both systems. The Powers equipment \u2018was custom-built and [was] not\nformed of interchangeable units\u2019.60 Changing from Burroughs to Powers-Samas\nequipment required from six months to a year and, with one exception, all the oper-\nators had to be retrained; their specific skills meant that former Burroughs operators\nwere transferred to work elsewhere or left the society. Migration to the Powers-\nSamas system resulted in the Alliance handling \u2018twice as many accounts as they had\nwhen they changed from Burroughs, with the same staff. Postings [were] more\neasily kept up to date and statistical information [was] more readily available\u2019.61\nThe approach of the Alliance to centralise all individual account information at\nhead office in Brighton contrasted sharply with that at the Halifax, traditionally the\nbiggest of all the building societies in terms of assets (see Table \uf644). The Halifax\ngave its retail branches full responsibility for the contents of account records and\ncontrol of the administration of individual accounts.62 The Halifax used Powers-\nSamas punched card equipment to summarise daily records of receipts and payments\nrather than to maintain individual accounts. After being sent daily to head office for\nprocessing, the records of each retail branch were analysed under various headings;\nthis permitted the General Ledger to bewritten up daily to show an up-to-date finan-\ncial position of the society.63\n60 WEBS, Visit to the Alliance, Ref \uf645: The change-over from Burroughs and benefits.\n61 WEBS, Visit to the Alliance, Ref \uf645: The change-over from Burroughs and benefits.\n62 Anonymous, Computer Systems and Services (\uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf64c, Halifax).\n63 WEBS, EA, Ref \uf644: The use of electronic and punched card accounting equipment by building\nsocieties.\nBERNARDO B\u00c1TIZ-LAZO AND PETER WARDLEY\uf644\uf64c\uf647\nDissemination of office technology not only differed between the societies but also\nwithin the societies themselves. For instance, the clerical and book-keeping effort\nneeded to deal with increased business volume within the most active retail branches\nof the CPBS was alleviated when, in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c, the society purchased three \u2018Sensimatic\u2019\nBurroughs accounting machines (model F \uf645\uf643\uf646 \u2013 at a price of \u00a3\uf644,\uf648\uf64c\uf648 each). These\nadding and ledger posting machines had part-manual and part-electronic features.\nThey differed from previous models in that ledger sheets and statements could be\nposted simultaneously while the balance to be brought forward was stored in mag-\nnetic strips on the reverse side of the ledger sheet.64 The machines were located at\noffices in Nottingham, High Wycombe and Bradford (and later Belfast) while\nsmaller book-keeping machines were relocated from those offices to retail branches\nin Swindon, Northampton and Middlesbrough where hand-operated technology\npersisted.65,66\nPractices at the CPBS, the Alliance and the Halifax suggest that the influence of\nearly mechanisation in the form of calculating machines and batch processing\noffered a cheap and efficient way to simplify book-keeping systems rather than devel-\noping methods by which to manage information. Simplifying book-keeping through\nmechanisation, however, also had some disadvantages and these became significant by\nthe \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf643s.67 There were three major drawbacks. First, account decentralisation led to\nduplication of information; at the retail branches several listings of different records\nwere required to update information on each account. Second, extended clearance;\na branch could expect a four- to five-day \u2018turnaround\u2019, sometimes exacerbated by\npostal delays, between the occurrence of a transaction and its documentation in a cen-\ntrally generated listing. Finally, congestion; the concentration of data preparation tasks\nin a single location, eventually called the Computer Centre, resulted in overcrowded\nstaff and equipment.\nThemain challenge for the utilisation of electronic equipment by building societies\n\u2018was to devise [administrative] procedures for it and to provide suitable input and\noutput equipment\u2019,68 This problem of peripheral input and output devices was\nsimilar to that encountered by J. R. M. Simmons at Lyons in the \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf643s where the\n64 Anonymous, \u2018The computer \u2013 and the story behind it\u2019.\n65 Co-operative Permanent Building Society [henceforth CPBS], Board Minutes, Nationwide Society\nArchives, Nationwide Building Society, Wellingborough, \uf645\uf648 June \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c (Ref Accounting Machines).\n66 Interestingly, a more advanced model of the same Burroughs accounting machine was still hailed as\ninnovative in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf646. Ralph Stow, General Manager of the Cheltenham and Gloucester, claimed that\ntwo Burroughs Sensitronic F\uf647\uf645\uf643\uf643 machines sufficed to handle the daily postings of this medium size\nsociety (some \uf646\uf646,\uf643\uf643\uf643 mortgage ledger accounts). This at a time when mechanical ledger posting was\nwidely used by many other medium and small sized societies.

However, while Leo Computers Ltd. was recognised as the leading and most\nexperienced manufacturer of the technology in \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64a, building society managers\nhesitated when faced with the price tag of \u00a3\uf64a\uf648,\uf643\uf643\uf643 for a Leo II (including\nancillary reading and printing equipment). Automation offered improved levels of\nproductivity but the adoption of data-processing equipment was price sensitive, as\nthese were expensive acquisitions. Moreover, managers were aware that migration\nto a new administrative system could be lengthy and expensive. Unsurprisingly,\ndirectors of building societies wanted reassurance about the effectiveness of any\nnew device:\nI think it may be agreed that we would not wish to keep our records by [electronic\/electro\nmagnetic means] until these [systems] have been in practical use on a wide scale for many\nyears.71\nHowever, directors of building societies could see a number of potential applications\nfor electronic equipment, including general-purpose computing technology. This\ncan be illustrated by a specific example (summarised in Table \uf645).\nAs Table \uf645 shows, monthly mortgage repayments were the largest item of account-\ning work for the Woolwich. Most of these payments were received through deposits\nat clearing banks that provided building societies with a \u2018posting medium which [was]\nsorted, listed and used for posting to the ledger account\u2019.72 Conveniently for both\n69 Hendry, \u2018J.

In part, building societies seem to have lagged\nbehind banks because they had a more \u2018relaxed\u2019 time frame in which to complete\ntheir processes. Indeed, where clearing banks in the UK had three to four days to\ncredit or debit an account, building societies worked on monthly and semi-annual\ncycles.\nAs had been the case of both American retail finance and their British banking\ncounterparts, the decision of a building society to automate, via the use of a computer,\nwas based on perceived cost savings and a technological frame of reference that viewed\nthe computer as a high-output paper-processing machine.74 According to Yavitz, the\nmost important factor in evaluating the savings potential of a proposed computer\ninstallation in banking was the anticipated payback period; that is, the number of\nyears of cumulative cost savings required to pay back the initial implementation\ncost.75 Payback was used as an indication of the effectiveness of the investment in\nnew technology and Yavitz estimated payback periods in American banks during\nthe mid \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643s ranging from one and a half to eight years, with a three-year\naverage and a three-and-a-half-year median. In \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf646 directors of the Leeds\nPermanent estimated that \u2018[a] large building society could install a computer system\nfor \u00a3\uf645\uf643,\uf643\uf643\uf643 to \u00a3\uf646\uf643,\uf643\uf643\uf643 per annum at the most, writing it off over seven\nyears\u2026\u2019.76 At the CPBS, it was estimated that capital costs and revenue expenditure\nwould be compensated by savings emerging from automation over \uf644\uf645 years but only if\nthe society doubled its size over that period and reached \u00a3\uf644,\uf643\uf643\uf643 m in total assets by\n\uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf649.77\nOn balance, however, the nature and extent to which computer technology\nenhanced the workings of retail financial institutions were below expectations.\nInitially, there were promises that, through the adoption of computers, building\nsocieties could exploit, on a regular basis, previously inaccessible information such\nas summary figures and balances for mortgages and term deposits per retail\nbranch.78 But evidence suggests that the introduction of the first computers failed\nto enhance information flows as, for example, profit and loss accounts of individual\nretail branches at the CPBS were only made available to senior management from\n\uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf645. Computer developments at the CPBS appear representative of those at other\nbuilding societies.\n74 Yavitz, Automation.\n75 Ibid.\n76 A.

At the time, Mr A. Schofield, a director of the Leeds\nPermanent, opined that\nIt is, perhaps, no exaggeration to suggest that the installation of a computer system, satisfactorily\nworking, and with its potential fully exploited, is likely to make redundant fully half of the\nstaff, male and female, previously engaged in routine clerical work\u2026 This might well\nmean, in the long term, the recruitment into the chief office of university graduates (of\nwhich there may eventually be a plethora)\u2026. [while continuing to attract] the \u2018O\u2019 level\nmale school-leaver [for the appointment of branch managers and staff].79\nSchofield\u2019s comment is remarkable for a number of reasons. On the one hand, he\nforecasts a fundamental shift in the mix of staff (to include the previously unheard\nof practice of attracting university graduates) but, on the other hand, he can not\nsee an end to the long-established practice of internal promotion (i.e. internal\nlabour markets). It is also striking that this diagnosis mirrors very closely that enun-\nciated half a century before by senior bankers contemplating mechanisation in the\nlate \uf644\uf64c\uf645\uf643s.\nSchofield\u2019s comment also acknowledges that a major force for the computerisa-\ntion of certain routine jobs was the potential to lower headcount (by lower recruit-\nment rather than redundancies) and increase financial returns.80 This is further\nillustrated through the pioneering efforts of the Abbey National. In \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf646 the\nAbbey used a Honeywell \uf647\uf643\uf643 to help eliminate handwritten passbooks, which\nwere replaced by computer-processed pre-prepared record slips. Having paper-\nbased slips directly routed to Lombard Street saved a considerable amount of\nwork at the retail branches.81 It also had the advantage, for the society, of increasing\nthe volume of funds cleared into an interest-bearing account; cleared funds could\nbe invested two days earlier than had been the case prior to the adoption of com-\nputer technology. Building societies were thus alerted early on that significant posi-\ntive effects on performance could accrue when investments in computer\ntechnology were matched with changes in complementary activities (such as organ-\nisational design, the creation of new jobs, recruitment practices or the access to\nfinancial markets).82\n79 Schofield, \u2018The electronic revolution\u2019.\n80 J. R. S. Revell, Banking and Electronic Fund Transfers (Paris, \uf644\uf64c\uf64b\uf646), pp. \uf649\uf64a, documents estimates of\nhuman tellers displaced by automated teller machines circa \uf644\uf64c\uf64b\uf643.\n81 The Woolwich estimated that in November\/December of \uf644\uf64c\uf648\uf64c, \uf644\/\uf646 of borrowers used bank orders\nand \uf644\/\uf649 credit transfers to pay their subscriptions. As a result half the number of payments accrued to\nbank-based transactions. The other half comprised transactions at retail counters or by post (\uf644\/\uf646) and\nthrough agents (\uf644\/\uf649).

In particular with regards to arrears and the\ncontrol of information at head office:\nIt was acknowledged that the reasons put forward for adopting E.D.P.\n[Electronic Data Processing] were similar to those which could be stated in con-\nsidering the case for centralisation of accounts. The important aspect to be borne in\nmind, however, was that centralisation, other than on a computer system, would\nbe impractical at this stage of the Society\u2019s development.\nIt is perhaps inevitable that there would be some loss of personal service to\nmembers but Management expressed the view that this was not likely to have\nany material effect on the development of the Society.83\nGreater efficiency associated with automation suggested that managers and direc-\ntors of building societies faced an apparent paradox. On the one hand, greater effi-\nciency through automation would result in greater centralisation. On the other\nhand, enhanced service offerings to customers associated with devolution of discre-\ntion to customer-facing-staff at retail branches implied greater decentralisation. In\npart, this was resolved as improved supervision and enhanced control over branches\nallowed increased, but more closely supervised, delegation of responsibility to local\nstaff. Senior managers opted for enhanced automation, in the form of newly intro-\nduced electronic and programmable computers, and improved communications,\nsuch as automatic internal switchboards. Automation resulted in the establishment\nof central accounting units and the centralisation of customer account control so\nthat regional and retail branch managers might eventually lose autonomy to centra-\nlised senior managers. For instance, the central accounting unit of the CPBS was\nestablished at Chesterfield House in the summer of \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf649, and within a few months\nthe first batch of the society\u2019s retail branches was using computer-style accounting\nnumbers for all new business. Shortly afterwards this practice was extended to all of\nthe \uf644\uf645\uf647 retail branches.84\n83 CPBS, Special Policy Board Meeting: Electronic Data Processing, Ref. \uf645\uf64c\uf649.b Centralisation of\nAccounts \u2013 Service to Members, \uf644\uf649 April \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf647.\n84 M.

For instance, as late as \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf647, the board of the CPBS was introduced\nto the workings of IBM\u2019s System \uf646\uf649\uf643 equipment.85 This prompted the General\nManager, J. H. Simpson, to appoint a Computer Manager and a Senior\nProgramming Assistant.86 The new manager would head the newly created\nComputer Department (which replaced the Operations and Methods Department)\nand:\nhad to be experienced in the Building Society work and, in particular, to have a thorough\nknowledge of the Society\u2019s methods and administration procedures. He would also be\nrequired to attend courses in computer programming and other operations in order to carry\nthe project through to installation.87\nHowever, by the late \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf643s it was becoming increasingly evident that developments\nin the field of computer technology were exceeding the ability of in-house exper-\ntise in financial service organisations. Different equipment configurations presented\na variety of advantages and disadvantages, turning the evaluation of equipment pro-\nposals into a complex technical task. For this reason top management in American\nand British financial institutions increasingly relied upon outside consultants to\nselect the equipment for them:\nThe use of an outsider also tends to neutralise some of the biases of employees familiar\nwith a particular manufacturer\u2019s equipment or of other financial or service ties with a\nparticular manufacturer. Nevertheless, equipment selection is still, to some extent\nsubjective.88\nIn the UK, the Bank of Scotland commissioned an investigation to work out profit\nobjectives for the next five years for individual retail branches, design a mathematical\nmodel to simulate decision making and review internal accounting practices. The\nexploratory team was to comprise of internal staff from the Profit Planning\nCommittee and the Management Accounting department as well as external advisors\nfrom PA Management Consultants.89 This consultancy project generated several\nreports including a feasibility study into rationalisation of branch locations and a\n85 CPBS, Special Policy Board Meeting: Electronic Data Processing, \uf644\uf649 April \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf647.\n86 Fenton F.

It appears that even external consultants were reluctant to\nsuggest the use of technology to bring about significant changes in banks\u2019 internal\nprocedures.\nAs for the building societies, the Woolwich\u2019s first computer was an IBM \uf646\uf649\uf643\/\uf646\uf643\nmainframe. This was installed in a purpose-built unit at Bexleyheath in June \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64b\nbut only after a team of management consultants from Peat Marwick Mitchell had\nspent several months studying the Woolwich\u2019s accounting systems. The study was\ncommissioned in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf648 and does not appear to have survived in full.91 But the\nintent of directors was that it should proceed \u2018with a view to recommending\ngeneral improvements in the [accounting systems], including the possibility of the\nintroduction of new forms of mechanisation based on electronic principles.\u201992\nIn \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64a, top managers of The Heart of England Building Society also commis-\nsioned \u2018a national firm of Chartered Accountants\u2019 to review their accounting\nsystem. These discussions continued throughout \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64b and led to an in-depth evalu-\nation of accounting methods as well as the purchase of one Burroughs E\uf645\uf644\uf648\uf647machine\nand auto-reader.93\nMeanwhile, the Leek andWestbourne appointed the auditing and accounting firm\nPrice Waterhouse in \uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64b as computer consultants.94 Their task was to carry out a\nfeasibility study to find the best computer for the society\u2019s business and the best\nsystem of operation. \u2018Price Waterhouse had considerable experience in this kind of\nwork, and particularly in competitive price ordering.\u201995 As a result of this exercise,\nthe Board decided to purchase a System \uf647\u2013\uf647\uf643 computer from ICL. At this time,\nthe Leek and Westbourne Society boasted \uf644\uf643\uf649 retail branches and \uf646\uf643\uf643 agencies\nthroughout the UK, with strong concentration in the north-west of England,\nLondon and the home counties.

Automation and the management of mechanised\nbanking had played a major role in all aspects of this process.\nVIII\nFor more than a century English banks and building societies have experienced a con-\nsistent process of change which has altered their nature, size and structure \u2013 they have\nalso been the location of significant technological change. This process embraced\nboth new machines and improved organisational methods. There is evidence that,\nwhen applying new technologies in banking practices, senior managers of clearing\nbanks and building societies consistently engaged in a systematic process of assessment\nof the potential for additional profit or reduced cost. There are obvious signs that\neconomic considerations determined both the decision to adopt or reject new tech-\nnology and, when adoption was chosen, the selection of the preferred technology.\nAlthough managerial style in the financial sectors was often regarded by the public\nas somewhat cautious, if not \u2018conservative\u2019, the financial companies reviewed here\ntended to quietly play the role of pioneers in the application of new information tech-\nnology. However, their public positions were strongly influenced by the perceived\nneed to maintain the intermediaries\u2019 reputation and an image of \u2018stability\u2019.\nLyons apart, with its own agenda in the development of information technology\nfor the reformation of its business practices, it was the financial intermediaries that\nwere the most significant customers for computer manufacturers who entered the\nbusiness application market. At the same time, senior managers of clearing banks\nand building societies learnt early on that there was little competitive advantage in\nadopting the latest technology as opposed to adopting the most effective technology.\nAnd here the technical barriers should not be forgotten: for instance, the more rapid\ncomputerisation of retail financial services was hindered by the limited storage capa-\nbilities of the technology available at the time, rather than by additional costs.\nHence, UK clearing banks and building societies had very specific problems and\nadopted particular responses given the technology available at the time. In the\nrealm of office machinery and mechanical accounting, these solutions favoured\nincreased efficiency rather than effectiveness. Internal control procedures and business\npractices remained largely unchanged during a period of rapid technological change.\nIt is only at the end of the period of our study, coinciding with yet another wave of\nautomation, associated with new and more powerful computer technology after\n\uf644\uf64c\uf649\uf64b, and influenced by decimalisation in the UK in \uf644\uf64c\uf64a\uf644, that the significant\nchanges appeared in management information systems within retail intermediaries.\nAuthors\u2019 addresses:\nSchool of Management\nUniversity of Leicester\nKen Edwards Building\nBERNARDO B\u00c1TIZ-LAZO AND PETER WARDLEY\uf645\uf643\uf647\nUniversity Road\nLeicester LE1 7RH\nUK\nb.batiz-lazo@leicester.ac.uk\nSchool of History\nUniversity of the West of England\nSt Matthias Campus\nOldbury Court Road,\nBristol BS16 2JP\nUK\npeter.wardley@uwe.ac.uk\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN UK BANKING \uf645\uf643\uf648\n"}
