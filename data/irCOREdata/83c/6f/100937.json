Structural deforma-\ntions have often been observed in STM and atomic force\nmicroscopy \u0001AFM\u0002 experiments on carbon nanotubes reveal-\ning bent and twisted tubes.1,2 Some of these defects are also\nassociated with a rearrangement of atoms and bonds which\nwill impact on the band structure, affecting thus the elec-\ntronic properties of the tube. AFM experiments and molecu-\nlar mechanics simulations1 have shown that the van der\nWaals forces between nanotubes and the substrate on which\nthey are placed can lead to significant deformations of their\nstructure as nanotubes tend to follow the topography of the\nsubstrate in order to maximize their adhesion energy. In this\nprocess, buckles or kinks can develop in the nanotube struc-\nture, when the strain accumulated exceeds a structural limit.3\nSTM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy \u0001STS\u0002 measure-\nments on kinklike structures have shown that they seam-\nlessly connect metallic and semiconducting parts of the same\ntube,4 in agreement with theoretical predictions that two\nnanotubes with different chiralities can be connected to-\ngether by a pentagon-heptagon pair.5\nA different type of deformation, predicted theoretically\nand evidenced experimentally by transmission electron mi-\ncroscopy and AFM,6,7 refers to the carbon nanotubes\u2019 suscep-\ntibility of collapsing radially into a flattened tube with bulbs\non either edge, in a geometry that balances the curvature\nenergy with the interlayer interaction.8 In this case, the large\nradial deformations are stabilized by the intersheet attraction\nbetween opposing sides of the wall. It was shown that col-\nlapse is favored in large tubes: as the tube circumference\nincreases, the excess curvature energy in the bulbs becomes\nconstant, while the energetic advantage of the intersheet at-\ntraction increases linearly.9,10\nDepending on the nanotube diameter, a map of stability\nwas obtained by atomistic simulations for the deformation of\nan \u0001n ,n\u0002 armchair single-walled carbon nanotube \u0001SWNT\u0002,\nshowing the possible regimes for partially and fully col-\nlapsed nanotubes and revealing the influence of the commen-\nsurability of the constituent layers, which induces further\nmechanical deformations beyond the flattening, such as\ntwisting and warping.11\nIn view of using carbon nanotubes for fabricating elec-\ntronic devices, it is important to understand to what extent\nthese deformations affect their electronic properties. Theoret-\nical studies have also been performed in order to identify the\ncorrelation between the structural perturbations and the\nchange in the electronic properties, and some of these studies\npredict remarkable changes. For example, the electronic\nproperties of a squashed armchair nanotube determined using\ntight-binding molecular dynamics calculations demonstrate a\nmetal to semiconductor transition upon squashing the\nnanotube.12,13 Similar deformations increase the gap in\nsmall-gap zigzag tubes, and gap closure can occur due to\nenhanced \u0002*-\u0003* hybridization effects.14\nWe present here observations of a collapsed carbon nano-\ntube encountered by STM experiments and confirm changes\nin the electronic properties due to structural perturbations, in\na study that correlates the atomically resolved structure to the\nelectronic behavior of the deformed tubes as studied by STS.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nFor STM experiments, a suspension of carbon nanotubes\nwas prepared by sonication in 1,2-dicholoroethane for ap-\nproximately 15 min and then drop casting on Au substrates\nprepared as described in Ref. 15. The sample was left in the\nfast entry lock of the system prior to introducing it into the\nSTM chamber and pumped overnight to allow for the speci-\nmen to outgas. The instrument used for the STM studies is a\ncommercial Omicron STM\/SEM HC, combining STM with\nscanning electron microscopy. Prior to STM experiments,\nscanner calibration was carried out on highly oriented pyroli-\ntic graphite \u0001HOPG\u0002, which also helped with assessing the\nquality of the tip by rendering the atomic resolution.

I-V curves re-\ncorded periodically during experiment on clean regions of\nthe Au substrate displaying metallic behavior also provide\nconfirmation of a suitably clean STM tip. All measurements\nwere carried out at room temperature in constant current\nmode. Typical scanning conditions used with this sample\nwere 0.1 nA for the tunneling current and a positive sample\nbias of 0.1 V. The STS measurements were performed by\ninterrupting the scanning and the feedback at preset locations\nand recording the tunneling current variations during the\nsample bias ramp \u0001usually between \u22122 and +2 V\u0002. STM im-\nages were processed using WSxM software.34\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe STM experiments revealed a few separate occur-\nrences of nanotubes clearly showing radial deformation of\ntubes, flattened to ribbonlike structures, indicating the forma-\ntion of collapsed configurations, as illustrated by Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002\nand 1\u0001b\u0002. The carbon nanotube \u0001CNT\u0002 in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 displays\ntwo distinct sections, also seen when examined at higher\nmagnification in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 a flat ribbonlike shape along its\nlength in the central region and a bulblike shape at each side\nof the edges. As also indicated by a cross-sectional profile\nalong a line perpendicular to the nanotube axis \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004,\nthis particular shape suggests a centrally collapsed nanotube.\nThe atomically resolved image allows for the determina-\ntion of the tube chiral angle. The chiral angle and the tube\ndiameter are linked to the chiral indices \u0001n ,m\u0002 of the tube\nwhich determine whether a SWNT will be a metal or a\nsemiconductor.16,17 The chirality determination in the case of\ncarbon nanotubes is complicated by the finite size of the\nSTM tip and the circular shape of the tube. The geometry of\nthe tip apex results in convolution effects, producing an ap-\nparent broadening of the nanotube, whereas the circular\nshape of the tube, combined with the tendency of the tunnel-\ning current to follow the shortest path, induces distortions in\nthe STM image of the nanotube lattice, making it to appear\nstretched in the direction perpendicular to the tube.18\u201320\nGenerally, for an accurate diameter determination, models\nfor deconvoluting the tip contribution are employed,21 which\nmight not yield a very precise determination in the present\ncase due to the noncircular shape of the nanotube and to the\nunknown geometry of the STM tip.\nFor the present case, a good estimation of the tube diam-\neter for the collapsed case would be given by total-energy\ncalculations which take into account the interlayer attraction\nbetween the opposing walls. Our estimation for the diameter\nof the tube in its uncollapsed state uses standard geometry,\nassuming that the cross section of the collapsed tube can be\nrepresented by the shape shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, where the two\nbulbs at the edges modeled to have circular cross sections are\njoined by a flat region of length l. The diameter of the tube in\nits uncollapsed state was determined by averaging between\ntwo extreme cases, as illustrated in Figs. 2\u0001b\u0002 and 2\u0001c\u0002. One\ncase corresponds to the situation wherein the opposing inter-\nnal faces of the tube come into contact \u0001d=0\u0002, as shown in\nFig. 2\u0001b\u0002, whereas for the other case, the tube is only flat-\ntened without an inflexion in the central region \u0003Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004.\nUsing the notations introduced in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002, the perimeter\nof the collapsed tube can be written to a gross approximation\nas twice the perimeter of two semicircles joined by the\nlength l:\nPcollapsed = 2\u0001\u0003r1 + \u0003r2 + l\u0002 with l = L \u2212 2r1 \u2212 2r2.\nBecause the perimeter of the tube should remain constant in\neither the collapsed or the uncollapsed state, we can estimate\nthe diameter D of the uncollapsed \u0001cylindrical\u0002 tube from\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 STM\nimages of the collapsed tube. \u0001a\u0002\nAtomically resolved STM image\nshowing the centrally collapsed\ncarbon nanotube and \u0001b\u0002 a\nzoom-in image of the nanotube\nshown in \u0001a\u0002.

The values for\nL\u00013.47 nm\u0002, r1\u00010.5 nm\u0002, and r2\u00010.5 nm\u0002 were obtained by\naveraging measured data points from 15 line profiles across\nthe tube.\nFor the case presented in Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002, corresponding to a\nlower attraction between the walls than in the previous case,\nbut still greater than the curvature energy, the diameter can\nbe estimated from\nPcollapsed = \u0001\u0003r1 + \u0003r2 + 2l\u0002 = Puncollapsed = \u0003D with l = L\n\u2212 r1 \u2212 r2.\nThe experimental values for L, r1, and r2 yield a 2.61 nm\nvalue for the diameter D, which by averaging with the value\nobtained in the previous case \u00012.98 nm\u0002 gives an estimated\nvalue of \u00052.79 nm for the tube diameter D in its uncollapsed\nstate.\nThe estimated value of the uncollapsed tube diameter can\ngive an indication of the number of constituent layers for the\ntube under investigation. When measuring the tube heights in\nrelation to the surface from the experimental cross-sectional\nprofiles, we estimate a value of \u00050.40 nm for the distance d\nbetween the opposing walls. This interspacing distance can\nonly be consistent with a SWNT, as it is of the order of the\ntypical interlayer value for graphite \u00010.34 nm\u0002. A double-\nwalled nanotube would yield a value equal to three times the\ngraphite interlayer spacing, i.e., \u00051.02 nm for the distance\nbetween the two flat faces of the outer tube, which clearly is\nnot the case here and therefore we conclude that it is a\nSWNT.\nHaving determined the diameter, we can now estimate the\nchirality of the SWNT based on the atomically resolved im-\nage. In order to avoid contributions coming from the sides of\nthe tubes, the chiral angle is best measured on the structure\nvisible on top of the tube, as sides can be distorted by the\neffects stated above.22 For the present case, the structure at\nthe top of the nanotube is reasonably flat on a sufficiently\nlarge scale as to ensure that these effects do not affect the\ncorrect chiral angle, which gives a value of 30\u00b0. Careful\nanalysis of the C hexagons on the bulbs reveals that their\nalignment is such that the C-C bonds are oriented perpen-\ndicular to the tube axis, giving a chiral angle of 30\u00b0, charac-\nteristic to the unique armchair-type structure. Closer inspec-\ntion also reveals fluctuations within \u00012\u00b0\u20133\u00b0\u0002 of the angle\nbetween the armchair and the zigzag direction from 90\u00b0\nwhich is generally the value for an armchair tube. These\nfluctuations could be the result of a twist of the nanotube,\nresponsible for modifying the angle between the zigzag and\narmchair direction,2 as highlighted in Fig. 3 \u0001inset\u0002, showing\nthe distortion of the hexagon as a result of a twist.

Atomistic\nsimulations11 reveal that different stacking between the com-\nmensurate and the incommensurate state induces the exis-\ntence of a rotational shift between the two adhering layers in\nthe energy minimization process, which is responsible for\nintroducing a twist or a warping \u0001a \u201c\u0001\u201d shape\u0002 structure. The\nobserved twist of the SWNT could thus be attributed to a\nrotation of the two flat opposing layers toward a more ener-\ngetically stable structure, possibly toward achieving the per-\nfect AB stacking, which was suggested to be a more stable\nformation than the AA stacking.10,11 In addition to being the\nresult of the nanotube following the substrate features, vis-\nible distortions of the C hexagons and apparent height varia-\ntions along the tube could also support a rotation of the flat\nlayers in the attempt of achieving a more energetically favor-\nable structure.\nA \u000121, 21\u0002 pair of chiral indices can be assigned to the\ncollapsed SWNT based on the values determined for the chi-\nral angle and diameter. We estimate an accuracy of 0.1 nm\nand \u00051\u00b0 for the measurement of the diameter and chiral\nangle, respectively. Such a tube is expected to exhibit metal-\nlic behavior. It is well known that minor variations of the\ndiameter and wrapping angle can drastically affect the elec-\ntronic properties of the CNTs. Here, however, due to the\nspecial value of the chiral angle for this tube, the range of\npossible diameters determined from the experimental cross-\nsectional profiles will not change its metallic behavior. As\nestimated above for the two extreme cases, the diameter can\nvary between 2.61 and 2.98 nm, corresponding thus to four\npossible values for the chiral indices n=m=19, 20, 21, and\n22, all making the tube metallic. On the stability map of the\nmost energetically favorable \u0001n ,n\u0002 armchair structures,11 all\nthese possible chiralities belong to the collapse metastable\nregion, suggesting that there might exist other more favor-\nable energetically structures, such as twisted or warped\nSWNT.\nTo correlate the atomic structure of this tube to its elec-\ntronic properties, STS spectra have been recorded along the\ntube and the normalized differential conductance calculated\nfor each curve to yield the density of states \u0001DOS\u0002.23 Spectra\nwere recorded at three different locations along the tube \u0001cor-\nresponding to points close to the beginning, middle, and end\nof the scan\u0002 on the flat central region and also at three other\nlocations on each bulb at the sides, showing reproducibility\nand repeatability along the tube. The results are displayed in\nFig. 3.\nTypical tunneling spectra recorded on the SWNT \u0001Fig. 3\u0002\nshow the peaks corresponding to the Van Hove singularities\nat the onsets of the one-dimensional energy bands of the\ncarbon nanotube. The peaks are asymmetric and broadened\nby the hybridization with the Au substrate, resembling well\nthe overall shape of the calculated DOS24 but observed to\nhave shifted by \u00050.1 eV to the left, toward the valence band,\nindicating doping by the substrate. The flat region at the left\nand right sides in the spectra taken on the collapsed region,\nand so the absence of the second Van Hove singularity above\n1 eV, is due to the preamplifier saturation and can also be\nconsidered as evidence for the better conductivity we ob-\nserve for the collapsed part.\nThe tunneling spectra can be used to determine the nano-\ntube diameter, and as for a metallic nanotube theory predicts\nthe following relation for the separation between the energy\nband edges: Eg\nm\n=6\u00040aC-C \/d,25 where aC-C is the distance be-\ntween two neighboring C atoms \u00010.142 nm\u0002 and d the diam-\neter of the nanotube. \u00040 is the value of the nearest neighbor\noverlap integral, ranging from 2.4 to 2.9 eV.19,26,27 The\nrange of diameters so obtained for the currently investigated\nnanotube is from 2.5 to 3 nm for a 0.8 eV separation, assum-\ning that the positions of the Van Hove singularities are not\naffected by the radial deformation.\nThe most prominent feature, however, is the difference in\nDOS at the Fermi level. The tunneling spectra recorded on\nthe central flat region show a finite DOS at the Fermi level,\nwhich is consistent with the metallic nature, while on the\nbulbs at either side of the tube an opening of a gap is ob-\nserved with a zero DOS, indicative of a semiconducting na-\nture. The zero DOS is consistent for all curves recorded on\nthe bulbs, but in contrast with the predicted metallic behavior\nfor an armchair tube.\nAn \u0001n ,n\u0002 armchair SWNT has n mirror planes containing\nthe tube axis, with two energy levels characterized by \u0003 and\n\u0003*, which are even and odd under mirror symmetry\noperations.14 These levels are degenerate at the Fermi level,\nresulting in metallic behavior. It was shown that when \u0001n ,n\u0002\ntubes are elongated and compressed in the axial direction,\nwhile maintaining a circular cross section, the mirror sym-\nmetry is preserved and the metallic conduction remains.\nHowever, radial deformation can break the mirror symmetry,\ndepending on the radial direction of the deformation,8,12,13\nand when the tube collapses, the normally radially separated\nareas of the nanotube are brought into close proximity and so\nthe low-energy electronic properties of the CNT altered. It\nwas predicted by theory12 that upon transverse collapse of\nCNTs, metallic \u0001n ,n\u0002 tubes become semiconductors and\nnarrow-gap \u00013n ,0\u0002 tubes can become metallic. Any gap in a\ncollapsed \u0001n ,n\u0002 nanotube arises purely from the coupling of\nthe interior faces of the flat region. The coupling mixes states\nwith k related by reflection across the tube axis and results in\nquadratic energy dispersion, exhibiting a gap, which was cal-\nculated to range from 0.04 to 0.2 eV at room temperature\nand zero pressure for a \u000120, 20\u0002 tube.\nAnother study of the metal to semiconductor transition in\na squashed armchair nanotube involving tight-binding mo-\nlecular dynamics13 shows that the metal to semiconductor\ntransition has to be driven by a combined effect of bond\nformation and mirror symmetry breaking. To open a gap, the\natomic orbitals of the two flattened faces of the squashed\ntube without mirror symmetry have to overlap with each\nother and form new bonds. It follows that one condition for\nobtaining a gap requires the distance between the two oppos-\ning walls to allow for the bond formation between equivalent\nC atoms. The spacing we obtain between the two opposing\nlayers is of the order of \u00050.40 nm, greater than 0.26 nm\nGIUSCA, TISON, AND SILVA PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 035429 \u00012007\u0002\n035429-4\nwhich is the length of an interplanar C-C bond. It is worth\nstating that the possibility for the interlayer spacing to be\nclose to 0.26 nm is not completely excluded as the interlayer\nspacing was obtained using height information extracted\nfrom multiple cross-sectional profiles and the apparent height\nprofile is known to be highly dependent on the imaging con-\nditions \u0001bias voltage, etc.\u0002, on the adsorption distance of the\nnanotube above the substrate, and different tunneling dis-\ntances on the nanotube and on the substrate. However, the\nbonding alone cannot open a gap if the mirror symmetry is\npreserved, and conversely, the mirror symmetry breaking\nalone only induces a variation in the conductance, without\nopening a gap.13 The mirror symmetry breaking is in direct\nrelation with the existence of the two equivalent sublattices \u0001\nA and B\u0002 of graphene. In reference to the A and B sublattices,\nif the axis along which the tube is squashed passes through\ntwo atoms of the same sublattice, the squashed tube will\nbreak the mirror symmetry about that axis but it will be\nmaintained if the axis passes through atoms of different\nsublattices.13\nIn other words, AA stacking between the flat opposing\nwalls will break the mirror symmetry, and if the walls are\nclose enough so that A atoms bond with A atoms, a gap will\nbe formed upon squashing. For AB stacking, the mirror sym-\nmetry is preserved and the \u0003 and \u0003* bands cross without the\ngap opening, regardless of whether a bond exists between the\ntwo flattened faces. The exact stacking order for the flat re-\ngion of our tube is difficult to determine from the existing\nSTM images as some of the C atoms appear brighter than\ntheir neighbors, indicating thus the atoms having a C atom\ndirectly underneath and the AB stacking, while other regions\ndisplay uniform brightness for all six atoms of the hexagons,\nconsistent with AA stacking.28 The AB stacking which does\nnot allow for the mirror symmetry breaking adds to the\nbonding absence due to the observed large interlayer spac-\ning, making observing a gap in the flat region unlikely.\nMixed stacking could be related to the degree of commensu-\nrability of the two flat opposing walls of the nanotube and\ncould also indicate an interlayer adjustment toward the more\nfavorable structure, such as translation or rotation of one\nlayer relative to the other and, a rotation could result in in-\ntroducing the observed twist.\nThe twist would be consistent with the gap opening in the\nDOS observed on the bulbs, as a localized twist is a source\nof electron backscattering and a uniformly twisted SWNT\nopens a gap at the Fermi energy, in a metallic tube.29 Based\non the determined value of the chiral angle which we believe\nis not affected by the tip effect distortions, on the C-C bond\norientation and the mixed stacking we observe that the 2\u00b0\u20133\u00b0\nfluctuations should correspond to a twist and not to a chiral-\nity in the nanotube. Note that the slight variation toward\nlower angles of the hexagon rows along the flat ribbon with\nrespect to the tube axis from the left to the right of the tube\ncould also account for a small twist. For an untwisted tube,\nall hexagon rows should align parallel to each other along\nthe tube. We estimate the difference in angle between the\nhexagon rows at the right and left of the tube to be \u00053\u00b0. This\nvalue coincides with the observed variation from 90\u00b0 of the\nangle between armchair and zigzag directions, giving further\nconfirmation for the existence of the twist. As expected, a\ntwist would also alter the bond distance between C atoms\nwithin the hexagons, a detail confirmed by the STM images,\nshowing evidence for elongated and compressed bonds rela-\ntive to the known value for graphite \u00010.14 nm\u0002. This also\ncontributes to the increase in the accumulated internal stress,\nwhich can alter the band structure due to possible rehybrid-\nization effects analogous to the gap opening in small diam-\neter nanotubes30 or induce changes to the sp2 bonding frame-\nwork as in systems such as fullerene polymer \u0001C60\u0002x and\nfullerene adducts. These systems contain several sp3 hybrid-\nized carbon atoms on the conjugated network of buckmin-\nsterfullerene, supposed to have carbons in an overall sp2 hy-\nbridized state, and were found to be better described by sp3.5\nand sp4.1 hybridization, respectively.31 Effects of stress-\ninduced band structure modification have also been observed\nexperimentally in highly compressive amorphous carbon thin\nfilms, where a decrease of an interplane sp2 cluster distance\nreduction of about 15% was found as a result of highly lo-\ncalized strain,32 in agreement with the previous work of\nUmemoto et al. on foamlike systems based on rigidly inter-\nconnected segments of graphite.33\nPseudogaps have been observed for metallic zigzag\ntubes30 and for armchair tubes packed within a rope. For the\nlatter case, the gap opening was attributed to interactions\nwith other tubes in the rope allowing for the \u0003 and \u0003* bands\nto mix. For the present case, the nanotube is not part of a\nbundle, and individual armchair tubes isolated on the sub-\nstrate were found not to display a pseudogap,30 so the possi-\nbility of a pseudogap can be excluded.\nHertel et al.1 have used continuum mechanics and mo-\nlecular mechanics simulations combined with AFM measure-\nments to show that defects or steps on the substrate can in-\nduce substantial distortions in adsorbed nanotubes due to\ntheir strong adhesion to the substrate. Using the relation they\nobtain for the binding energy dependence on the diameter,\nwe estimate a van der Waals binding energy of \u00050.2 eV\/\u00c5\nfor a tube of 2.8 nm diameter. Due to the large binding en-\nergies involved, Hertel et al. also find that the forces between\nthe nanotube and features of the substrate such as steps or\nother defects can be extremely high, and they estimate a\nforce of \u000535 nN for a tube of 10 nm diameter, with a\n1 eV\/\u00c5 in binding energy,1 which would result in a force of\n\u00059 nN for our case, presumably responsible for inducing the\ncollapse we observe.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn armchair SWNT in a collapsed configuration was ob-\nserved by STM and the experimental observations on the\nelectronic behavior substantiate the validity of previous the-\noretical studies on radially deformed tubes. Atomically re-\nsolved images are consistent with mixed stacking suggesting\nthe influence of the lattice commensurability as a likely rea-\nson for shifting the opposing layers relative to each other\ntoward a minimum-energy state, in accordance to earlier\nstudies. As a result, the twist-induced deformation alters the\nmetallicity of the armchair structure and a gap is observed on\nthe bulbs of the collapsed tube. Finite density of states at the\nFermi energy found on the central ribbon region when the\nATOMIC AND ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE IN COLLAPSED\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 035429 \u00012007\u0002\n035429-5\ninterlayer spacing does not allow for the bond formation be-\ntween equivalent C atoms constitutes the first experimental\ntest of earlier theoretical calculations. Our experiments show\nthat the electronic properties of armchair nanotubes are\nslightly disturbed under mild radial deformations provided\nfurther deformations are not induced and might find applica-\ntions for nanotube device fabrication allowing for fine and\nlocal tuning of their electronic properties. The results clearly\nindicate the delicate nature of the carbon nanotubes and, in\ngeneral, the significant change in electronic properties of\nnanowires when subject to local stresses and\/or pressure.\nThis has serious implications in the design of nanowire inte-\ngrated circuits predicted to replace planar complementary\nmetal-oxide semiconductor devices and also shows that care\nneeds to be taken when probing the electronic properties of\nsuch structures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors with to acknowledge the financial support\nafforded by the EPSRC, UK.\n*Corresponding author; s.silva@surrey.ac.uk\n1 T.
