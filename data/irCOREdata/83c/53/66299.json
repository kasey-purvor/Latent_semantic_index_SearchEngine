This may be tentatively extended to a difference\nfrequency and the interaction of wave packets, for which\nHW is the bunch of waves grouping around the conversion\nfrequency ! with the wave vectors k! \u0002 !=c\u0003!\u0004. IHW is\nthe wave packet with the same frequencies ! \u0002 \u0001!p, but\nwith wave vectors k!p \u0001 k!p\u0005\u0001!p \u0006!=vg\u0003!p\u0004, where\n\u0001!p is the bandwidth of the pump. Constructive interfer-\nence of IHW and HW occurs on the scale of the coherence\nlength LFWcoh where the phase matching condition is met\n[3,4]. In practice, because of dispersion and wave vector\nmismatch, phase matching is rarely achieved over a large\nlength scale, at least for a broad band of frequencies. So far,\na considerable number of papers published on nonlinear\ninteractions of wave packets have used the NLWC model\nto interpret their results, e.g., [5\u20139]. On the other hand, the\ngeneration of high frequency electromagnetic radiation\nfrom the passage of a short optical pulse through a non-\nlinear medium has been suggested [10] by analogy with the\nmoving charge radiation phenomena, Vavilov-Cherenkov\nradiation (VCR) and transition radiation (TR) [11]. It is\nknown from [12\u201314] that VCR hardly couples into free\nspace because of Cherenkov angle normally exceeds the\nangle of total internal reflection. Therefore, in this Letter\nwe consider only collinear mechanism of terahertz (THz)\nradiation.\nThe NLWC model was not called into question until the\npublication of [15] where a new effect was found experi-\nmentally: a twin pulse of THz radiation generated from the\nnonlinear conversion of a single optical pulse in an electro-\noptic crystal, and tentatively attributed to a type of radia-\ntion emanating from boundaries. Such twin pulses, how-\never, may be alternatively interpreted within the NLWC\nmodel by associating THz pulses with the HW and IHW.\nBecause of dispersion the HW and IHW packets \u2018\u2018walk-\noff\u2019\u2019 with different velocities, c, vg, respectively. Then the\ndifference \u0001t in the arrival time for HW and IHW pulses at\nthe end of crystal considered as the near field is \u0001t \u0002\nL=c\u0001 L=vg.\nThisambiguity,associatedwith the application of NLWC\nand TR models, calls for a reappraisal of the theoretical\nfoundation of the generation of radiation in nonlinear me-\ndia. Although both models (for different reasons) require\nnonlinear coupling of pump fields, the physics of the emis-\nsion mechanisms are distinctively different. To analyze\nTHz generation in nonlinear materials we use frequency-\ntime domain analysis of radiation resulting from the propa-\ngation of a short pump pulse through a slab of nonlinear\nmedium of thickness L and under the condition of arbitrary\nwave vector mismatch. The analysis begins from the set of\nequations for the electric component of the THz field in\ntime domain, E\u0003r; t\u0004 including the wave equation:\n r2E\u0003r; t\u0004 \u0001 1\nc20\nZ \u00051\n\u00011\ndt0\u0001\u0003t\u0001 t0\u0004 @\n2\n@t02\nE\u0003r; t0\u0004 \u0002 \u00020 @\n2PNL\u0003r; t\u0004\n@t2\n\u0005r \u0007 \br \u0007 E\u0003r; t\u0004\t (1)\nand the Poisson equation\n \u00010\nZ \u00051\n\u00011\ndt0\u0001\u0003t\u0001 t0\u0004r \u0007E\u0003r; t0\u0004 \u0002 \u0001r \u0007 PNL\u0003r; t\u0004; (2)\nwhere\n P NL\u0003r;t\u0004\u0002\u00010\nZ \u00051\n\u00011\ndt0\u0003^\u00032\u0004\u0003t\u0001 t0\u0004:Ep\u0003r;t0\u0004E\np\u0003r;t0\u0004: (3)\nThe first item in the right-hand side (rhs) of (1) is the time\nderivative of nonlinear term of the displacement cur-\nrent JNLd .

For a propagating wave packet, v is\nthe group velocity. This description resembles the familiar\nstatement in the theory of radiation from moving charges\n[11]. In this case, instead of an external uniformly moving\nfree charge, a polarization charge is formed in the medium\ndue to nonlinear coupling of fields.

In the slab, the charge\nis created at z \u0002 0 and instantaneously accelerated upon\nentry of the pump pulse into slab. The charge then moves\nuniformly across the slab. Finally, the polarization charge\nis instantaneously decelerated and extinguished at z \u0002 L\nupon exit of the pump pulse from the slab emitting a\nsecond burst of radiation. The situation is analogous to\nthe Tamm problem of the start-stop motion of a free charge\n[16,17]. For collinear and anticollinear radiation at the\nnormal incidence of pump the problem has axial symmetry\nalong the z axis. The wave front of the pump field within\nthe slab volume can be considered as nearly plane, and\nconstrained within an aperture determined by the beam di-\nameter S0. For a short optical pulse, we use a slowly vary-\ning amplitude approximation representing the pump elec-\ntric field in the rhs of (3) as the product of the Gaussian\npulse envelope and the plane carrier wave at the frequency\n!0: Ep\u0003z;t\u0004\u000212exE0exp\b\u0001\u0003t\u0001z=vg\u00042\u00034\u00052p\u0004\u00011\texpfi\b!0t\u0001\nk\u0003!0\u0004z\tg\u0005c:c:, where vg is the group velocity of the pump\nwave packet: vg \u0002 c0\bn\u0003!0\u0004 \u0005!0dn\u0003!0\u0004=d!0\t\u00011, \u0005p is\npulse FWHM [7].

All material parameters\nnecessary for calculations are taken from [23,24].\nThe waveform of THz radiation calculated and mea-\nsured from a 1 mm slab of LiNbO3 in free space is shown\nin Fig. 1. The theoretical waveform fits quite well with the\nexperimental time dependence. The THz waveform con-\nsists of several separated pulses. Two leading pulses, TA\nand TB, (curve 1 and 2, Fig. 1), represent THz radiation\nemitted during a single flight of the pump pulse; and are\nconsistent with the observation made in [15]. Prefix \u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019\nhere indicates the transmission geometry, i.e., THz radia-\ntion emitted from the slab in the forward direction. Each\npulse starts with intensive bipolar oscillations defining the\noverall shape of the spectral envelope [25]. Figure 2 plots\nthe fan diagram of pulse positions as a function of slab\nthickness. The position of pulse TA follows the time of\nflight of the pump pulse, tA \u0002 Lnopt\u0003!0\u0004=c0. The temporal\nposition of the pulse TB corresponds to tB \u0002 LnTHz=c0;\nthat is, the time of flight of the THz radiation pulse across\nthe slab. The relative time of flight between pulses TA and\nTB is \u0001tA-B \u0002 L\u0003nTHz \u0001 nopt\u0004=c0. As stated above, these\ndata themselves do not deliver conclusive evidence on the\nspatial location of the source regions of TA and TB pulses.\nIn search of such proof we turn to the analysis of other\nproperties of radiation that so far have not been addressed.\nThe amplitude dependence on thickness for forward\nemitted radiation, shown in Fig. 2, demonstrates linear\ngrowth of the main THz pulse amplitude at thicknesses\nL < LFWcoh . At a certain thickness, corresponding to the\nonset of wave vector mismatch, the main pulse splits into\ntwo labeled as TA and TB pulses. The amplitude of pulse\nTA saturates with L and remains largely constant irrespec-\ntive of further increase of slab thickness. Unlike pulse TA,\nthe amplitude of pulse TB strongly falls with L. This may\nbe regarded as a signature of strong attenuation and broad-\nening of the pulse TB inside the slab. To identify a con-\nvincing proof we address the comparison of the properties\nof TA and TB pulses and their echo replicas, the pulses TA0\nand TB0 following the leading pair TA-TB. The key sig-\nnificance of the data extracted from the properties of echo\nreplicas is motivated by the idea that, for spatially sepa-\nrated sources (TR model), the echo replicas should show\ncharacteristic modifications of properties; whereas, for the\npulses generated within the same volume adjacent to the\ninput surface (NLWC model), the echo replicas should\nhave, at least, the same structure and amplitude ratio.\nMoreover, if, as suggested in [1], the so-called IHW does\nindeed represent a real propagating wave (created by non-\nlinear conversion along with HW), it must keep its \u2018\u2018ex-\ntraordinary\u2019\u2019 properties. These are the following: the\nfrequency is equal to the conversion frequency !; and\nthe complex wave velocity vg is equal to that of pump\npulse. From Fig. 2, showing the fan diagram of arrival\ntimes for the main pulses and their reflection replicas, we\ncan see that time positions for the TB0 replica behave con-\nsistently with the properties of the TB pulse. Being re-\nflected sequentially from the output and input interfaces,\nthe pulse TB0 acquires a round trip delay 2LnTHz=c0 in\naddition to the direct arrival time tB0 \u0002 3LnTHz=c0. The\narrival time of flight for the TA0 pulse, tA0 , includes the time\nof flight of TA, Lnopt=c0 accomplished with a round trip\n \nFIG. 1.

Pulses labeled TA-TB, and TA0-TB0\ncorresponds to forward emitted THz radiation and their first\nround trip echo-replicas, respectively.

Then, the arrival time of\nTA0 is tA0 \u0002 Lnopt=c0 \u0005 2LnTHz=c0. This follows from\nboth the experiments and theory\u2014Fig. 2. To our knowl-\nedge, this striking result has not yet been reported else-\nwhere. It strongly favors the TR model, providing evidence\nfor conversion of the polarization charge field into a pulse\nof THz radiation at the entry to and the exit from the slab.\nMoreover, Fig. 1 shows a striking inversion of the ampli-\ntude ratio from TA=TB \r 1 to TA0=TB0 & 1, also in favor\nof this mechanism. It shows that after a seemingly simple\nround trip, THz radiation pulses demonstrate a striking\nchange of amplitude ratio: compare the ratio of TA to\nTB0, and the ratio TA0 to TB0 in Fig. 1. Had the sources\nof pulses TA and TB been localized within the same spatial\nregion of the nonlinear slab from the front surface, as in-\nterpreted in [1], then both TA and TB pulses would bounce\nback and forth keeping at least the same amplitude ratio.\nFrom the data of Fig. 3, we estimate the ratio of formation\nlengths for forward to backwards emitted THz radiation.\nThe backward emitted pulses are shown by using \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 to\nmark their affiliation to the backward (reflection) direction.\nSince the field amplitude is proportional to the value of the\nformation-coherence length, we obtain the ratio \n \u0002\nTB=RB\u0006 LFWcoh=LBWcoh . It is clear that the ratio TA=TB is a\nmeasure of absorption in the slab. Assuming that the\nabsolute value of peak amplitude remains the same on\nboth interfaces, we recover the amplitude of the TB pulse\nat z \u0002 0\u0005 TBjz\u00020\u0005 \u0006 TA. Then, from Fig. 3 we find\nLFWcoh=L\nBW\ncoh \u2019 2:5; this is in a good agreement with the\ncalculated value of \n \u000e 2:46.\nTo summarize, the theory unambiguously establishes the\nlocation of sources of THz radiation to be in the regions,\nadjacent to the input and output interfaces, where the\npolarization charge is instantaneously formed and accel-\nerated and subsequently instantaneously decelerated and\nextinguished. The experiments fully back up our theoreti-\ncal conclusions. It can be shown that the interference of\nTHz TR, emanating from both boundaries, causes the\nappearance of Maker fringes [3].
