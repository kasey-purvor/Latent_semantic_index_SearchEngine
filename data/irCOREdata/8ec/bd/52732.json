Approximately 100 specimens of the pectinid bivalve\nAustrochlamys anderssoni (Hennig, 1911) were collected from the permafrost active layer. This bivalve\nspecies has a late Miocene to late Pliocene range and has previously been reported from both the\nglaciomarine Hobbs Glacier Formation and the interglacial Cockburn Island Formation in the James Ross\nIsland area. The localized presence of abundant A. anderssoni within the permafrost suggests that the fossils\nhave been frost heaved from an outcrop of either the Cockburn Island or the Hobbs Glacier formations,\noriginally deposited on northern James Ross Island. The overall shell form, general absence of associated\nAntarctic Peninsula-derived clasts in the host sediment, and the measured 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratio of the\nshells (0.709050) which is indistinguishable from that for pectinid bivalves from the Cockburn Island\nFormation on Cockburn Island (0.709047) suggest that the shells were derived from a unit similar in age to\nthe Cockburn Island Formation. This suggests that the Cockburn Island Formation was originally more\nlaterally extensive than was previously known.\nReceived 26 January 2004, accepted 8 September 2010, first published online 26 January 2011\nKey words: Cockburn Island Formation, fossil reworking, Hobbs Glacier Formation, late Miocene\u2013\nPliocene, permafrost\nIntroduction\nAlthough the James Ross Basin is well known for its\nextensive Cretaceous and early Tertiary sedimentary\nrecord, there are also important small, isolated exposures\nof late Miocene to Pliocene sedimentary rocks associated\nwith the James Ross Island Volcanic Group (e.g. Sykes\n1989, Pirrie et al. 1997, Jonkers et al. 2002, Smellie et al.\n2006, Hambrey et al. 2008, Nelson et al. 2009). Together\nwith the volcanic rocks, these sedimentary rocks and their\nassociated fauna provide important palaeoenvironmental\ndata for the northern Antarctic Peninsula region during the\nlate Miocene and Pliocene epochs (e.g. Smellie et al. 2006,\n2008, 2009, Nelson et al. 2008, Williams et al. 2010). One\nimportant component of the fauna associated with these\nsedimentary rocks are pectinid bivalves, first described\nfrom Cockburn Island by Andersson (1906). These bivalves,\nwhich are assigned to Austrochlamys anderssoni, were\noriginally thought to indicate interglacial conditions but have\nalso been described from glaciomarine strata (Jonkers et al.\n2002). In this paper the presence of reworked Austrochlamys\nanderssoni in modern day periglacial sediments on northern\nJames Ross Island is described. The occurrence of these\nbivalves is interpreted as reflecting periglacial reworking of late\nMiocene to late Pliocene sedimentary units initially deposited\non northern James Ross Island. Fossiliferous Neogene outcrops\nare uncommon in the region, and in Antarctica generally, but\nthe discovery of the Brandy Bay outcrop is evidence that these\nfossiliferous outcrops are more widely distributed than was\nonce thought. They are a potentially rich, but as yet under-\nutilized, resource of past climatic and palaeoenvironmental\nconditions (e.g. Williams et al. 2010).\nField setting and stratigraphy\nAbundant specimens of Austrochlamys anderssoni were\ncollected from a 30m2 area of modern periglacial active\nlayer sediments at locality DJ.1501 (63850.64'S, 58801.57'W)\nsouth-west of San Carlos Point, Brandy Bay, northern\nJames Ross Island at an altitude of c. 75m (Fig. 1). The\ngeomorphological setting is a low-gradient slope with well\ndeveloped patterned ground (Bibby 1965, Lundqvist et al.\n1995, Bjo\u00a8rck et al. 1996). Bibby (1965) recognized a\nnumber of such low-gradient terrace-like surfaces around\nJames Ross Island and interpreted them in terms of marine\nerosion surfaces (cf. Strelin & Malagnino 1992). The bivalve\nspecimens were vertically to sub-vertically oriented within\n180\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 14 Nov 2013 IP address: 194.66.0.114\nthe active layer sediments (Fig. 2) and, commonly,\nconcentrated within fractures defining the patterned ground.\nThe thin-shelled bivalves are disarticulated, but show little\nabrasion. Larger clasts within the active layer sediments at the\nsample site are mainly basaltic rock fragments derived from\nthe James Ross Island Volcanic Group, along with clasts of\ngranite and metasedimentary rocks comparable with Trinity\nPeninsula Group lithologies exposed in the northern Antarctic\nPeninsula region (cf. Pirrie et al. 1997, Smellie et al. 2006,\nNelson et al. 2009). Clasts interpreted as derived from the\nTrinity Peninsula Group also occur throughout the underlying\nCretaceous sedimentary succession on James Ross Island\n(Ineson 1989, Pirrie 1991), together with rare granitic clasts.\nBoth clast types are present within the late Miocene to\nPliocene glacial sedimentary units associated with the James\nRoss Island Volcanic Group (Pirrie et al. 1997). However,\nclasts reworked from the Cretaceous strata on James Ross\nIsland are typically rounded or well rounded and can usually\nbe easily distinguished from the characteristically angular\nclasts derived directly from the Antarctic Peninsula (Smellie\net al. 2006, Hambrey et al. 2008, Nelson et al. 2009).\nAustrochlamys anderssoni has previously been described\nfrom both the late Pliocene Cockburn Island Formation\n(Jonkers 1998a) and from a number of late Miocene to\npossibly late Pliocene sedimentary units associated with the\nJames Ross Island Volcanic Group (Smellie et al. 2006,\nNelson et al. 2009, Williams et al. 2010). The Hobbs\nGlacier Formation was originally described from southern\nJames Ross Island where it is late Miocene in age,\nunconformably overlies Cretaceous sedimentary units and\nin turn is overlain by the James Ross Island Volcanic\nGroup (Pirrie et al. 1997). In its type area, the formation is\na laterally extensive, but thin (few to several metres),\ndiamictite-dominated unit which was sourced from the\nAntarctic Peninsula, along with clasts derived from older or\neven potentially contemporaneous parts of the James Ross\nIsland Volcanic Group (Pirrie et al. 1997). Subsequently,\nJonkers et al. (2002), Smellie et al. (2006), Hambrey et al.\n(2008) and Nelson et al. (2009) described the presence of\nsedimentary rocks (mainly diamictites and conglomeratic\nsediment gravity flow deposits) interbedded with the James\nRoss Island Volcanic Group from numerous localities on\nJames Ross Island. These exposures are late Miocene to\nlate Pliocene in age (Smellie et al. 2006, Nelson et al.\n2009) and Jonkers et al. (2002) suggested that they should\nbe included within the Hobbs Glacier Formation, a practice\nwe also adopt here for convenience of description only.\nThicknesses of 64\u2013150m are reached in a few outcrops, and\nmany of the stratigraphically higher deposits interbedded with\nthe volcanic units on James Ross Island lack Peninsula-\nderived erratics (Nelson et al. 2009, Smellie et al. 2009).\nThe Cockburn Island Formation, defined by Jonkers\n(1998a), is only known to crop out on Cockburn Island. The\nformation comprises sandstones, pebbly sandstones and\nconglomerates, which overlie volcanic rocks of the James\nRoss Island Volcanic Group. It has yielded a molluscan\nFig. 1.

Other\nmacrofossils include the barnacle Fosterella hennigi\nNewman, 1979, brachiopods, a cidarid echinoid (Jonkers\n1998a) and an extensive assemblage of encrusting bryozoans\n(U. Hara, personal communication 2003). A similar biota\nalso occurs in fossiliferous outcrops of the Hobbs Glacier\nFormation (Jonkers et al. 2002, Williams et al. 2010). The\nCockburn Island Formation has been interpreted as reflecting\na transition from a rocky shoreline environment down to\nwater depths of approximately 100m (Jonkers 1998a). An\nessentially sea ice-free setting was also inferred principally\nbased on a virtual absence of ice-rafted debris derived from\nthe Antarctic Peninsula, which contrasts with many of the\noutcrops of the Hobbs Glacier Formation (Jonkers 1998a, see\nalso Jonkers & Kelley 1998). Dating of the Cockburn Island\nFormation was initially controversial, with a mean Sr isotope\ndate reported in Dingle et al. (1997) of 4.7 Ma (10.6\/-1.2),\nbased on the V3:10\/99 look-up table of Howarth and\nMcArthur (1997), being in conflict with an age, based on\ndiatom biostratigraphy, that is close to 3 Ma (Jonkers &\nKelley 1998). 40Ar\/39Ar dating of one of the lavas underlying\nthe Cockburn Island Formation yielded an age of c. 4.8Ma,\nproviding a maximum age for the formation (Jonkers &\nKelley 1998). A depositional age of 4.66 (10.17\/-0.24) Ma\n(indistinguishable from that suggested by Dingle et al. 1997)\nwas established by McArthur et al. (2006), based on further Sr\nisotopic analyses of multiple pectinid shells.\nThere are several sedimentary outcrops associated with\nthe James Ross Island Volcanic Group relatively close to\nthe fossil locality reported herein. These sedimentary rocks\noccur in, and at the base of, the volcanic cliffs on the north\nside of Davis Dome (Fig. 1) and they also form a large\noutlier of sedimentary rock, at least 20m thick and 500m in\nextent, situated near (east of) Stoneley Point (Smellie et al.\n2006, 2008). Four volcanic units have been distinguished in\nthe James Ross Island Volcanic Group at Davis Dome. The\noldest (at Stoneley Point) is a tuff cone remnant whilst the\nyounger units represent different phases of effusion as lava-\nfed deltas (Skilling 2002, Smellie 2006). A single thick\nvolcanic delta formed of lava and hyaloclastite breccia unit\ndominates the outcrop (Smellie et al. 2008). Discontinuous\nsedimentary beds typically 1\u20131.5m thick separate each of\nthe volcanic phases, but the deposits thicken to 10 and 18m\nat two places. Most are dominated by massive to crudely\nbedded, pale grey to dark brown diamictite with abundant\nsilty to fine sandy matrix (typically 60\u201370%), and granules\nto boulders of basalt derived from the James Ross Island\nVolcanic Group, less common hyaloclastite breccia and\na distinctive but minor population (few %) of quartz-veined\nphyllite and fine sandstone, granitoids, and altered\nintermediate to evolved lavas derived from the Antarctic\nFig. 2.

Pale green Cretaceous siltstone\/fine sandstone\npebbles derived from James Ross Island are also present.\nMany of the larger clasts are facetted and a few in each\noutcrop are striated. Fossils have only been found in the\nlarge sedimentary outlier east of Stoneley Point but are\nscarce and highly fragmented (Nelson et al. 2009). The\nfield relationships strongly suggest that deposition of these\nsedimentary beds was coeval with their immediately\noverlying volcanic units, which yielded 40Ar\/39Ar ages\nof 5.64 \u00b1 0.25, 5.36 \u00b1 0.05 and 4.74 \u00b1 0.03 Ma (Smellie\net al. 2008; all errors are 2s).\nPalaeontology\nThe c. 100 collected pectinid fossils (DJ.1501.1-61, lodged\nin the collections of the British Antarctic Survey,\nCambridge, UK) are fragmented and abraded to varying\ndegrees, but are nonetheless clearly recognizable as\nbelonging to a single species. Fifty-six fragments are\nidentifiable to right or left valve type, most consisting of the\ndorsal part of the shell with either the complete hinge\npreserved or with just one of the auricles present. Right\nvalves are dominant, only seven left valves were collected.\nSeveral specimens have encrusting bryozoa and serpulids\non the outer shell margins.\nRibbing on right valves is formed by a pattern of bifurcating\nand intercalated ribs: primary ribs bifurcate in early ontogeny,\nwith addition of secondary ribs between the main pairs further\naway from the umbo (Fig. 3). Costation in the few left valve\nfragments is less clear, but seems to be made up of ribs\nthat increase in number by intercalation only. Prominent\ncommarginal lirae are present on both rib crests and in\ninterspaces, but are visible only near the anterior and posterior\ndisc margins, where these have escaped abrasion (Fig. 3e).\nRibbing pattern, dimensions of hinge and auricles, width\nof umbonal angle, and number of functional byssal teeth\n(Table I) confirm that the Brandy Bay pectinids can be\nassigned to Austrochlamys anderssoni. This species was first\ncollected on Cockburn Island in 1903 by J.G. Andersson\n(Andersson 1906), and is known from several outcrops in the\nJames Ross Island area (Jonkers et al. 2002, Smellie et al.\n2006), and also from the McMurdo Sound area of the Ross\nSea (Speden 1962). It has a late Miocene to late Pliocene\n(c. 7 to ,3Ma) age range. Austrochlamys anderssoni is a\nchlamydoid with a rather strongly prosocline shell (Fig. 3a;\nsee also Jonkers 2003, fig. 27), in which the anterior\n(partial) umbonal angle (UAA; Fig. 4) is wider than the\nposterior portion of that angle (UAP), but this is not well\nreflected in the Brandy Bay samples, possibly due to the\nlow number of observations (Table I).\nValve height (VH; Fig. 4) of the shells from Brandy Bay\ncould be determined by direct measurement in one specimen\nonly (DJ.1501.8\/8a; Fig. 3e; VH 114.1mm). In another\n(DJ.1501.5; VH c. 125mm) VH was estimated from\nprojection onto a specimen with known valve height\n(DJ.851.4 from Cockburn Island). Valve height of other\nspecimens was computed from the length of the outer\nligament (OL, n5 5), length of the anterior outer ligament\n(OLA, n5 9), or length of the posterior outer ligament (OLP,\nn5 9), using the regression equations given for A. anderssoni\nby Jonkers (2000). It appears that the majority (64%, n525)\nof identifiable valves fall within a size range of VH\n100\u2013110mm (Fig. 5a). On Cockburn Island 86% of all\nvalves also fall within a narrow range of 100\u2013120mm\n(Fig. 5b; shell material only, internal and external moulds\nare excluded). Mean VH in the Brandy Bay and Cockburn\nIsland samples is also remarkably similar: 105.6 \u00b1 1.4mm\n(n5 25) and 109.2 \u00b1 1.7mm (n5 264), respectively.\nSelective removal of most left valves and nearly all valves\nsmaller than 100mm at both Brandy Bay and on Cockburn\nIsland, together with the disarticulated nature of the material,\nsuggests that the assemblages were modified by a single\nprocess, i.e. the repeated freezing and thawing of a thin\nsurface layer. On Cockburn Island articulated pairs (and small\nvalves) have only been preserved as moulds. Only a single\nalmost articulated pair with a collapsed left valve (DJ.851.6;\nVH 110.2mm for right valve) was encountered among 316\nshelly fossils examined (Jonkers 2003).\nValves recovered from their original matrix elsewhere\ndemonstrate that Austrochlamys anderssoni is essentially\na thin-shelled species. The sharp cut-off in lower valve\nheight of frost-heaved shells suggests that valve thickening\nwas narrowly delineated, principally taking place during\nlate ontogeny.

Such foliated calcite re-entry is particularly\nwell developed in high latitude species (Waller 1991).\nPreferential thickening of the right valve (the valve on\nwhich the animal rests, and usually the heavier of the two:\nin the Recent Austrochlamys natans (Philippi, 1845) by\n14% (HAJ unpublished data)) may possibly help in\nmaintaining life position, preventing the animals from\nbeing easily overturned by currents.\nThe relatively narrow umbonal angle (105\u20131098), the\nlow contrast in convexity between the lower (right) and\nthe upper (left) valve (see fig. 19a in Jonkers 2003), the\nhigh auricular asymmetry (OLA\/OLP 1.52 \u00b1 0.05, n5 5;\n1.53 \u00b1 0.04, n5 29; in Cockburn Island shells), a byssal\nnotch that is comparatively deep (Jonkers 2003, fig. 19b),\nand the high mean number of functional byssal teeth (4.7)\nin Austrochlamys anderssoni, are all indicative of low\nmotility. In addition the species\u2019 close association with\ncoarse-clastic lithofacies (conglomerate, diamictite) suggests\nthat it may have lived attached to large clasts in water depths\nof ,100m (Jonkers 1998a).\nAntarctic chlamydoids, including Austrochlamys anderssoni,\nhave until recently been placed in Zygochlamys Ihering, 1907,\neither at subgeneric (e.g. Fleming 1957) or at generic level\n(Jonkers 1998a, 1998b, 2000). Because of this inclusion\nthey have been thought of as indicators of interglacial\nepisodes (see discussion in Jonkers 1998a). However,\nevidence from outcrops on northern and eastern James Ross\nIsland, in which articulated pairs of A. anderssoni occur\nwithin thick-bedded glaciomarine diamictite, was interpreted\nby Jonkers et al. (2002) to suggest that the species is\nunreliable as an indicator of warmer climatic interludes.\nHowever, palaeotemperature information preserved in\npectinids and bryozoans from the same stratum as discussed\nby Jonkers et al. (2002) clearly indicate relatively warm\n\u2018\u2018interglacial\u2019\u2019 conditions and not full glacials (i.e. d18O values\nin pectinids suggest temperatures of c.12.5 to -1.18C (Williams\net al. 2010), with a greater temperature range (c. 5.6\u20137.78C)\nsuggested by MART (mean annual range of temperature)\nvalues in associated bryozoans (Clark et al. unpublished\ndata; see also sedimentary evidence for \u2018\u2018interglacial\u2019\u2019\nconditions (Nelson et al. 2009). Austrochlamys anderssoni\napparently favoured waters that were largely sea ice-free\nand it became extinct in Antarctica as sea ice extent\nexpanded in response to climate cooling in the Late\nPliocene (Williams et al. 2010).\nA revision of fossil and Recent pectinids of the Southern\nOcean and neighbouring regions has demonstrated that the\nFig. 4.

There\nare currently five other known species of Austrochlamys:\nA. gazdzickii Jonkers, 2003, from outcrops of Oligocene\nrocks on King George Island, South Shetland Islands;\nA. marisrossensis Jonkers, 2003, from Early Miocene cored\nrock in the Ross Sea; Late Miocene A. heardensis (Fleming\n1957), from sub-Antarctic Heard Island; A. tuftsensis (Turner\n1967), from the Pliocene of Wright Valley, Victoria\nLand, and the Vestfold Hills, Ingrid Christensen Coast; and\nthe extant, relict species A. natans, which lives in a\ngeographically limited area off southernmost South America.\nAustrochlamys has retained a number of primitive\ncharacters, such as a prosocline shell, a deep byssal notch,\nseveral modes of rib introduction in the same shell, ribs\nconsisting of simple crenulations, commarginal lirae present\nin rib interspaces, and antimarginal microsculpture (Waller\n1993). Shagreen microsculpture, which consists of a pattern\nwith the appearance of a fine net, formed by the offset\ncontacts of frilled commarginal lamellae (see Waller 1991,\npl. 1, figs 7 & 11), and which first appeared in primitive\nrepresentatives of tribe Chlamydini (e.g. Zygochlamys), never\ndeveloped in these Antarctic scallops and Austrochlamys is\ntherefore placed in a tribe of its own (Austrochlamydini).\nRepresentatives of the South American late Eocene to\nPliocene genus Zygochlamys, which have mostly acline\nshells, and of the South American and New Zealand genus\nPsychrochlamys Jonkers, 2003, a Pliocene to Recent cold\nwater genus with acline to strongly opisthocline shells, never\noccurred in Antarctica.\nDiscussion\nAustrochlamys anderssoni is very abundant in the\nCockburn Island Formation (Jonkers 1998a) and is also\nlocally abundant within the Hobbs Glacier Formation at,\nfor example, Pecten Spur near Cape Gage (Jonkers et al.\n2002, Nelson et al. 2009). Whilst glacial strata that could\nbe assigned to the Hobbs Glacier Formation crop out\nthroughout northern James Ross Island (e.g. Sykes 1989,\nSmellie et al. 2006, Hambrey et al. 2008, Nelson et al.\n2009), there are no known outcrops of the Cockburn Island\nFormation other than on Cockburn Island itself. When\nthe Brandy Bay bivalves are compared with those from\nCockburn Island, it is apparent that they are very similar in\nterms of both size and overall shell morphology, although\nthe size distribution may be a function of the periglacial\nprocesses that have reworked the bivalves both at Brandy\nBay and on Cockburn Island (Jonkers 1998a). Based upon\nthe abundance of bivalves, it is interpreted that they have\nbeen frost-heaved from a localized occurrence of late\nNeogene sediment originally deposited in the Brandy Bay\narea. It is possible that the fossils were derived from either\nthe Cockburn Island or Hobbs Glacier formations, or their\nequivalents. In an attempt to try to resolve from which\nformation they were derived, two specimens (DJ.1501.8\nand DJ.1501.11) were selected for Sr isotope analysis\nfollowing the methodology presented in Dingle et al.\n(1997) and McArthur et al. (2000). These specimens gave\n87Sr\/86Sr ratios of 0.709051 \u00b1 0.000015 and 0.709049 \u00b1\n0.000015, respectively. The mean of 0.709050 \u00b1 0.000011\n(n5 2) is statistically indistinguishable from that of\n0.709047 \u00b1 0.000007 (n59) for samples of Austrochlamys\nfrom the Cockburn Island Formation on Cockburn Island\n(Dingle et al. 1997; reporting uncertainty as 2s of the mean,\nrather than 2 SD of the data, as given by those authors).\nIn contrast, both these mean values are distinctly different\nfrom 87Sr\/86Sr ratios for fossils from the Hobbs Glacier\nFormation, except for a single deposit at Fo\u00a8rster Cliffs\n(probable depositional age 2.5Ma, Smellie et al. 2008)\nthat is characterized by reworked fossils (Dingle et al. 1997,\nDingle & Lavelle 1998, McArthur et al. 2006, Smellie\net al. 2006, Nelson et al. 2009). Using the most recent\nSr-isotope calibration curve for the interval, which includes\nnew data for the Pliocene type-sections on Sicily (McArthur\n& Howarth 2004, McArthur et al. 2006) the ratio\n0.709050 \u00b1 0.000011 equates to a numerical age of 4.33\n10.6\/-1.3Ma. The Brandy Bay deposit almost certainly\noverlies Cretaceous sediments, rather than being interbedded\nwith volcanic strata. Outcrops of the Hobbs Glacier Formation\nthat directly overlie Cretaceous strata are distinguished by\nconspicuous Peninsula-derived erratics, which are absent in\nthe Brandy Bay outcrop. Given this observation, and the\ncomparison in overall shell size and preservation, and similar\nSr isotope composition, it is more probable that the bivalves\nwere derived from a unit equivalent to the Cockburn Island\nFormation rather than from the Hobbs Glacier Formation.\nThis would suggest that the Cockburn Island Formation may\nbe more geographically widespread than previously known.\nThe low-gradient surface the bivalves are resting upon may\nindeed, reflect a marine cut platform (cf. Bibby 1965, Strelin\n& Malagnino 1992) and thus conceivably is a very old feature\n(early Pliocene). The limited abrasion and their localized\nconcentration is indicative that the bivalves have undergone\nminimal lateral reworking within the active layer, but these\nfossils are clearly no longer in their original stratigraphical\ncontext and they reflect reworking as a result of periglacial\nprocesses.\nAcknowledgements\nFieldwork and Sr isotope analysis were funded through\nNERC-AFI research grant GR3\/AFI2\/38.
