From the launch of Sputnik-\n1 in 1957, most satellites at the end of their mission have been left for the orbit\nto decay naturally. More than two decades ago this was recognised as a poten-\ntial problem, and space debris is now an active area of study. Papers presented\nat the Fifth European Conference on Space Debris (Klinkrad, 2009) provide\na good overview of current work, especially in related engineering and tech-\nnology. Current activities include implementing debris mitigation measures in\nadvance of eventual debris remediation, and are focussed on low Earth orbit\nwhere the problem is most urgent; geosynchronous orbit (GEO) is also impor-\ntant because of its commercial significance. However, space debris is an issue\nwhich goes far beyond the science and engineering of satellites and their orbits:\nlegal, security and financial issues are also involved. Taylor (2006) provides a\nhelpful overview of space debris including these wider issues.\nSeveral studies of long-term orbit behaviour relevant to space debris mit-\nigation in GEO have been published. Using orbits propagated over 100 yr,\nAnselmo & Pardini (2008) identify the importance of orbit eccentricity man-\nagement and passivation as mitigation precautions, as well as presenting re-\nsults for orbit perturbations which lead to highly eccentric orbits for some\nlight objects (e.g. collision fragments). Chao & Gick (2004) show results for\nnavigation satellite orbits and show how orbit eccentricity at some inclinations\ncan grow as large as 0.7. Such eccentricity growth would dramatically reduce\norbit lifetime (the satellites experience much higher atmospheric density at\nperigee) and also increases collision risk between active and defunct satellites\n(as defunct satellites leave disposal orbits and cross regions containing active\nspacecraft): both are significant issues for debris mitigation. Other useful stud-\nies of long-term orbit behaviour include Lewis et al. (2004), Westerkamp et\nal. (1997) and Wytrzyszczak & Breiter (2001). These all illustrate that over\nlong periods of time, subtle perturbations can accumulate to have significant\neffects on orbit evolution. Studies such as these provide the scientific basis for\npractical debris mitigation measures now coming into use.\nSince the 1990\u2019s efforts to understand space debris and to develop miti-\ngation methods have been underway internationally and are coordinated by\nthe Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). Guidelines\nhave been published by IADC (2002) and are being adopted almost univer-\nsally by space-faring nations. In the last decade an increasing number of mis-\nsions included deliberate action to remove a satellite from useful orbit regions\nat the end of the operational phase (e.g. SPOT 1 (Alby, 2005), Inmarsat\nF3 (Hope, 2007)). More recently, the International Organisation for Stan-\ndardization (ISO) is supporting the development of international standards\nwhich translate the IADC guidelines into engineering practice though its sub-\n2\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \ncommittee TC20\/SC14 (Aircraft and Space V ehicles \/ Space Systems and\nOperations). Several of these standards will shortly be published, and in par-\nticular ISO 24113 (Space systems - Space debris mitigation) and ISO 26872\n(Space systems - Disposal of satellites operating at geosynchronous altitude)\nrelate to satellite disposal from GEO.\nA key requirement for GEO missions drawn from the IADC guidelines is\nthe need for the disposal orbit perigee to be a minimum height (h \/ km) above\nthe geostationary altitude as expressed in Equation 1.\nh = 235 + 1000 CRA\/m (1)\nCR is the spacecraft\u2019s solar radiation pressure (SRP) reaction coefficient (or\nSRP coefficient, dimensionless, with a value from 0 (a hypothetical transparent\nspacecraft) to 1 (totally absorbing - matt black) to 2 (reflecting perfectly back\ntowards the Sun)), and A\/m is the spacecraft\u2019s area to mass ratio (m2 kg\u22121):\nthese parameters refer to the whole satellite including appendages, averaged\nover all relevant viewing aspects. Both parameters depend on the reference\narea used for normalisation: the same area should be used in both cases. The\ncombined parameter CRA\/m, sometimes referred to as effective A\/m ratio,\ncan be estimated by orbit tracking; example values are 0.02\u20130.04 m2 kg\u22121\n(Hope, 2007).\nTo enable practical use, ISO 24113 and ISO 26872 require 90% reliability\nof the disposal manoeuvre (rather than the ideal, but unachieveable, 100%).\nCombining this with the inherent uncertainty of satellite fuel measurement,\ndesigners and operators must be conservative in their fuel budgets so that\nat least 90% of disposal manoeuvres achieve the IADC perigee increase. The\nactual perigee heights achieved are thus generally higher than the nominal\nheights required because of this safety margin. A further effect which can\nbe modelled simply is the spread in perigee height due to gravity and SRP\nperturbations.\nThe questions this study aims to answer are (1) what disposal orbits are\nlikely to be achieved once the ISO interpretation of the IADC guidelines is\napplied, and (2) what are the key factors which determine these orbits? An-\nswers to these questions allow us to evaluate the expected effectiveness of the\nstandards in mitigating space debris, and can be used to quantify satellite\ncollision risks in the GEO region.\nThe next section derives the analytical relationships describing the disposal\norbits expected. Following that, results illustrating the effects of typical pa-\nrameter values are presented and then discussed. Finally, some conclusions\ndrawn from the research are presented.\n3\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2 Method of calculating orbit height distributions\nThe method presented describes orbits by a probability density distribution\nof their (perigee) heights above the ideal geostationary height (i.e. probabil-\nity per unit height interval; the distribution in inclination is assumed to be\nindependent of height). There are three steps:\n(1) Calculate the distribution of nominal perigee heights to satisfy the IADC\nguideline as a function of the satellite properties (CR,A\/m).\n(2) Calculate the actual perigee heights achieved allowing for propellant mea-\nsurement uncertainty and the required disposal manoeuvre reliability.\n(3) Allow for the effect of orbit perturbations on orbit height to quantify the\nlong-term distribution of orbit height.\nIn the following derivations, the symbols p, \u03c1 and P are used for a (a)\nprobability, (b) probability density (e.g. probability per unit height interval in\nkm), and (c) cumulative probability, respectively.\n2.1 Distribution of nominal perigee heights\nTo calculate the distribution of nominal perigee heights using Equation 1\nthe distribution of the product of satellite parameters CRA\/m is required.\nThis can be evaluated directly if data for a representative satellite popula-\ntion are available, or derived from separate probability distributions for each\nparameter. For the results presented here, separate distributions for CR and\nm\/A are combined (m\/A is used rather than A\/m since it is easily related\nto the familiar ballistic coefficient B = m\/(CDA)). Figure 1 shows the dis-\ntributions assumed to represent hypothetical and not actual populations of\nsatellites with low or high reflectivity (Figure 1(a)) and low or high mass\nper unit area (Figure 1(b)); for simplicity the distributions are assumed to\nbe independent. The probability densities are defined conventionally, i.e. as\nprobability per unit x-axis interval, and the integrated area under each curve\nis exactly 1.0 (dimensionless). The distributions are chosen to bound likely\nvalues of the parameters; the distributions are not meant to directly repre-\nsent populations of existing satellites. Thus real satellite parameters should\nfall within the range of parameter values assumed (typical values of CR = 1.2\nto 1.5 (IADC, 2004) have a tighter distribution than shown in Figure 1(a),\nso the \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cbright\u201d cases successfully bound actual values; similarly\nthe distribution of A\/m values presented by Lewis et al. (2004, Fig. 6) from\nESA\u2019s DISCOS database falls between the \u201clight\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d distributions\nof Figure 1(b)). (Note that the probability densities for A\/m and m\/A are\nrelated by \u03c1(A\/m) = \u03c1(m\/A)(m\/A)2.)\n4\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n(a) SRP coefficient distribution for the \u201cbright\u201d (solid line)\nand \u201cdark\u201d (dashed line) cases\n(b) Mass per unit area distributions for the \u201clight\u201d (solid\nline) and \u201cheavy\u201d (dotted line) cases\nFig. 1. Assumed distributions of parameters for hypothetical satellite populations\nbounding the values of those likely to be found for current and future satellites.\nFigure 2(a) illustrates how the probability for the product of the parameters\nCR and A\/m is calculated. The integral of the joint probability density over\nthe shaded region gives the cumulative probability that the product is less\nthan or equal to a given value; the differential of the cumulative probability\nis the probability density.\nConsider small intervals in area to mass ratio (a, a+\u03b4 a) and SRP coefficient\n(CR, CR + \u03b4CR). The probability that the spacecraft properties are in both\nthese intervals (assuming independent distributions) is\n5\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n(a) Cumulative probability integral\nfor perigee height < h1\n(b) Fuel measurement error distribution\nFig. 2.

The cumulative\nprobability (Equation 3) that the spacecraft properties are such that the re-\norbit perigee height is less than or equal to h1 can be evaluated numerically\nin two steps:\n(1) For a given value of area to mass ratio a, the probability (Equation 2) is\nintegrated from CR = 0 to CR(h1) (Equation 4), CR(h1) is the smaller of\n(a) the SRP coefficient which gives a re-orbit height equal to h1 for that\nvalue of a = A\/m and (b) 2 (the maximum value of CR).\n(2) The one dimensional integrals of the above step are integrated over all\npossible values of a, i.e. from a1 to a2, to calculate the total cumulative\nprobability.\nThus the cumulative probability that perigee height h (in km) is less than a\ngiven value (h1) is P (h < h1):\nP (h < h1) =\na2\u222b\na1\nCR(h1)\u222b\n0\n\u03c1(a)\u03c1(CR) da dCR (3)\nwhere CR(h) = min\n(\n2,\nh\u2212 235\n1000 a\n)\n(4)\nand a = A\/m (m2 kg\u22121)\nThen \u03c1(h1) =\ndP (h < h1)\ndh1\n(5)\nWe write \u03c1min(h) for this probability density distribution for the minimum\nrequired perigee height to satisfy the IADC GEO disposal guideline.\n6\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2.2 Distribution of achieved perigee heights\nFigure 2(b) represents the fuel measurement error distribution. No pub-\nlished data documenting actual fuel measurement uncertainty distributions\nnear end-of-life have been found and so the curve represents a general case.\nDue to the measurement uncertainty, when a given measurement is made (e.g.\nmmeas), the operator is uncertain about the true amount of remaining fuel.\nTo ensure that the actual amount available exceeds the amount necessary for\nthe minimum disposal manoeuvre (mdisp) the operator must act conserva-\ntively. If the distribution is known, then the margin (mmeas\u2212mdisp) can be\ncalculated for any desired reliability. There is still a finite probability (repre-\nsented by the shaded area in Figure 2(b)) that not enough fuel is available,\nbut this can be kept small enough to satisfy operational requirements by being\nsufficiently conservative.\nFor small changes in orbit height (assuming manoeuvres of the same type),\nthe \u2206V required is proportional to the height change, and fuel used is pro-\nportional to \u2206V . Thus the fuel mass required is proportional to the height\nchange, and so the uncertainty in fuel mass is proportional to the uncertainty\nin achieved orbit height change. It is convenient to express the fuel measure-\nment uncertainty as a fraction of the fuel required to achieve the nominal\nperigee height: let \u03c30 be the ratio between fuel mass measurement standard\ndeviation (\u03c3m) and the fuel mass required to achieve the minimum perigee\nheight for disposal (mdisp), i.e. the fractional fuel measurement uncertainty.\nThen the standard deviation in achieved perigee height change (\u03c3h) is the\nsame fraction of the minimum perigee height (hmin).\n\u03c30 =\n\u03c3m\nmdisp\n=\n\u03c3h\nhmin\n(6)\n\u03c3h = \u03c30 hmin (7)\nNote that it is assumed that \u03c30 is independent of hmin. This assumption\nsimplifies the model and without more comprehensive data on fuel measure-\nment uncertainty a more sophisticated model is not justified.\nIf the distribution of fuel measurement errors is known (e.g. here it is as-\nsumed to be Gaussian) then the fuel margin required to ensure a given ma-\nnoeuvre reliability can be calculated directly. Let z be the normalised deviate\nfor the distribution of fuel measurement errors (z = \u03b4m\/\u03c3m where \u03b4m is the\ndifference from the mean of the distribution (the mean is the measured fuel\namount), and \u03c3m is the measurement standard deviation), and P (z\n\u2032) be the\ncumulative probability that z < z\u2032. The inverse cumulative distribution gives\n7\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFig. 3. Incremental probability \u03b4p = \u03c1 \u03b4h corresponding to height increment \u03b4h for\nthe probability distribution of nominal re-orbit height.\nnormalised deviate as a function of probability: z = P\u22121(p), e.g. for a Gaus-\nsian distribution P\u22121(0.1) = \u22121.282 and to ensure >90% probability that\nm > mdisp requires mmeas \u2212 mdisp > 1.282\u03c3m. Assuming that operators\nuse the minimum fuel to achieve the manoeuvre with the required reliability,\nsince fuel mass and orbit height change are proportional, the mean of the\ndistribution of achieved perigee heights with probability p is\nh = hmin \u2212 P\n\u22121(1\u2212 p) \u03c3h (8)\n= hmin\n[\n1\u2212 P\u22121(1\u2212 p) \u03c30\n]\n(9)\nThus when the measured fuel is just sufficient to re-orbit to height h, then\nthe operator should command the manoeuvre since after this time the fuel\nmargin relative to the measurement uncertainty will be too small to achieve\nthe required disposal reliability.\nThe distribution of achieved perigee heights after the re-orbit is calculated\nby summing the spreads in height achieved for each nominal perigee height\n(hmin) weighted by the probability of that re-orbit height being required to\nmeet the IADC guideline. This gives the expected distribution of achieved\nperigee heights for the population of satellites corresponding to the distribu-\ntion of hmin. Figure 3 shows the probability increment corresponding to a\nsmall height range for the distribution of nominal re-orbit heights; the cor-\nresponding probability increment is \u03b4p = \u03c1min(h)\u03b4h. For this value of hmin,\nEquations 9 and 7 can be used to calculate h and \u03c3h for the distribution of\nachieved heights.\nThis probability increment thus leads to a distribution of achieved heights\n\u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h), which contributes to the total distribution of achieved heights\nwith weighting \u03b4p. Because of the proportionality between fuel use and orbit\nheight change, \u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h) is just a scaled version of the distribution of fuel\nmeasurement errors.\n\u03b4\u03c1a = \u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h) \u03b4p (10)\n8\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nThe complete distribution of actual perigee heights achieved is obtained by\nsumming these contributions over all values of hmin.\n\u03c1a(h) =\nhmin,2\u222b\nh1=hmin,1\n\u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h) \u03c1min(h1) dh1 (11)\nwhere h and \u03c3h are functions of the required manoeuvre reliability (p), the\nfractional fuel measurement uncertainty (\u03c30), and of hmin.\n\u03c1a(h) is the probability density for the achieved perigee h given the re-\nquired re-orbit reliability p, the fractional fuel measurement uncertainty \u03c30,\nand the function hmin(CRA\/m) which determines the recommended minimum\nre-orbit perigee height. As noted above, the probability density \u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h) for\nthe height spread at a specific hmin is scaled from the distribution of fuel\nmeasurement errors. For a Gaussian error distribution this is given by\n\u03c1(h; h, \u03c3h) =\n1\u221a\n2pi \u03c3h\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u2212(h\u2212 h)2\n2\u03c32h\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (12)\nwhere h and \u03c3h are functions of hmin, p and \u03c30 (Equations 9 and 7). Data\nare not currently available to justify a more sophisticated model.\n2.3 Distribution including long-term orbit perturbations\nPerturbations act on a satellite\u2019s orbit in the GEO region so that eccen-\ntricity changes cyclically leading to further spreading of orbit height. This\nresults in a long-term distribution of orbit heights which is slightly broader\nthan the distribution of initially achieved heights. Equation 1 includes factors\nfor two aspects of this process. 35 km of the constant value of 235 km are to\nallow for periodic gravity perturbations which change the orbit eccentricity\nand lower the perigee over periods of several decades. Solar radiation pressure\nalso changes orbit eccentricity: the term 1000 CRA\/m approximately quanti-\nfies this effect (in km). The orbit is thus \u201csmeared\u201d in height by intervals of\nthese sizes over periods of decades and longer; as a first approximation the\norbits are assumed to spread uniformly over the corresponding height bands\n(\u00b135 km and \u00b11000 CRA\/m).\n9\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2.4 V alidation and Practical Implementation\nTo validate a practical implementation of this algorithm it is useful to check\nthe normalisation of the probability density distribution at each stage. The\nintegral of the probability density over all reasonable values of the independent\nvariable should be exactly 1.0 if normalisation has been retained. In practice\nthere will be a small deviation from this due to numerical approximations, but\nthe discrepancy need never exceed 0.01 if satisfactory digitisation resolution is\nused (i.e. small enough increments in perigee height and CR, etc.). In addition\nto this, straightforward tests using plots of intermediate and final results give\nconfidence that equations have been correctly implemented.\n3 Results\nThe algorithm of section 2 has been used to evaluate several specific cases:\n\u2022 Various satellite properties (low and high SRP coefficient, low and high area\nper unit mass)\n\u2022 Alternative fuel measurement uncertainties\n\u2022 Several levels of disposal manoeuvre reliability\nThe reference values for disposal manoeuvre reliability and fuel measurement\nuncertainty are based on the proposed ISO implementation (p = 0.9) and on\ngood current propellant monitoring, respectively. Y endler & Jew (2008) in-\ndicate that with care the amount of remaining propellant can be estimated\nwith uncertainty equivalent to one month\u2019s fuel use. In GEO the typical \u2206V\nallowance for station-keeping is 52 m s\u22121 per year; one month\u2019s fuel is there-\nfore equivalent to 4.3 m s\u22121. A typical \u2206V requirement for the nominal IADC\ndisposal manoeuvre is 11 m s\u22121, so the fractional fuel measurement uncer-\ntainty (assumed to be one standard deviation) representative of current best\npractice is \u03c30 = 4.3\/11 = 0.4. Independent estimates of \u03c30 for current GEO\ncommunication satellites range from 0.2 to 1.35 (for large and small satellites\nrespectively, pers. comm.) suggesting that a typical value of 0.4 is reasonable.\nComparing results for the different cases with various levels of resolution\n(e.g. 500 or 1 000 point discretization of the probability distributions) indicates\nthat the distribution mean and standard deviation are generally accurate to\n1\u20132 km.\n10\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFig. 4.

The method presented here has both\nstrengths and weaknesses. Its main strengths are that it quantifies the impor-\ntance of key parameters directly and uses an algorithm which is computation-\nally simple and which requires minimal computing resources. The method is\n14\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nrelatively transparent, so that results can easily be validated and assumptions\nare explicit. Its weaknesses include that it does not propagate orbits directly\nbut instead has to rely on parameterizations (e.g. for orbit perturbations)\ncalculated independently. Thus it also ignores effects such as gravitational\nharmonics which might cause clustering around certain longitudes for orbits\nvery close to the ideal geostationary orbit, and is not time-dependent and so\ncannot easily capture the process as orbit perturbations disperse the initial\ndisposal orbits. However, as one tool among several, this method is useful for\nunderstanding the disposal orbits likely to be achieved by GEO satellites at\nend-of-life.\nThree aspects of the final disposal orbit height distributions are investigated\nusing the results presented. The first is the relative importance of satellite\nparameters (CR, A\/m) and fuel measurement uncertainty on the spread in\nlong-term orbit heights. Figure 5 shows clearly that for a typical fractional\nfuel measurement uncertainty of 0.4, it is the fuel measurement uncertainty\nwhich predominantly determines the spread of orbit heights. Although the\ndistribution of nominal orbit heights to satisfy the IADC guidelines may vary\nsignificantly between different types of spacecraft (Figure 4), once an operator\nhas made appropriate allowances for fuel measurement uncertainty and the\nrequired disposal reliability, most of the orbit height spread is determined by\nthe fuel measurement uncertainty and not the satellites\u2019 other characteristics.\nThe additional orbit height changes due to long-term perturbations only add\na small amount to the width of the orbit height distributions.\nThe second aspect studied is to quantify the effect of improving the fuel\nmeasurement accuracy. Figure 6(a) shows the influence of reducing the frac-\ntional fuel measurement uncertainty to 0.1, i.e. about 1 m s\u22121 of \u2206V. At this\nlevel the height distribution narrows significantly (to about half the width for\n\u03c30 = 0.4) and satellite parameters become relatively more influential on the\nfinal orbit. This fuel measurement accuracy corresponds to about one week of\nnormal station-keeping, and it is unlikely that there are benefits to justify an\noperator making great efforts to achieve or exceed this. Conversations with\noperators indicate that \u03c30 can vary significantly between spacecraft. If the\ntrend for larger GEO satellites with more accurate fuel measurement contin-\nues, small rather than large (> 0.5) values for \u03c30 seem appropriate.\nThe third issue investigated is the influence of the disposal manoeuvre\nreliability on the final orbits. Figure 6(b) shows the final orbits for the bright\n& light case (the case for which satellite properties are most influential) for four\ndifferent levels of reliability (the ISO implementation of the IADC guideline\nrequires a reliability p \u2265 0.9). The distribution mean increases as p increases,\nby about 100 km as p increases from 0.80 to 0.95, and its standard deviation\nincreases slightly (from 120 km to 126 km). The safety margin an operator\nneeds so that disposal reliability is above 50% represents a penalty in fuel\n15\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nwhich, on average, will be \u201cwasted\u201d since it takes the satellite above the IADC\nminimum altitude. The term \u2212P\u22121(1 \u2212 p)\u03c30 of Equation 9 quantifies this\npenalty: for a Gaussian distribution and the reliabilities of 0.80, 0.85, 0.90,\n0.95, these penalties are 0.842\u03c30, 1.036\u03c30, 1.282\u03c30 and 1.645\u03c30 respectively.\nThus if an operator chooses to plan using a disposal reliability of 0.95 instead\nof 0.90, the extra height (proportional to extra fuel required) is equivalent to\n0.363\u03c30 or around 1.6 m s\n\u22121 of \u2206V (for \u03c30 = 0.4). This suggests there is a\nrelatively small penalty for an operator to plan conservatively and to design\nthe disposal manoeuvre with a reliability better than 90%.\n5 Conclusions\nThe method presented here efficiently quantifies the influence of the main\nparameters on the distribution of GEO disposal orbit heights. It explicitly\nevaluates the probability density distribution of orbit heights, and is designed\nespecially to quantify the effect of the ISO implementation of the IADC guide-\nlines. It includes parameters describing the satellites (SRP coefficient CR, area\nto mass ratio, fuel measurement uncertainty), the desired disposal orbit height\n(calculated using the IADC guideline), and the required probability of success\nfor the disposal manoeuvre.\nThe main finding from this research is the practical importance of the fuel\nmeasurement accuracy. Using representative values for satellite properties, the\nmain factor determining the spread of orbit heights is the fuel measurement\nuncertainty rather than variation in the satellite\u2019s SRP coefficient or area\nto mass ratio. With a fuel measurement uncertainty corresponding to about\n4 m s\u22121 of \u2206V (typical current best practice), the width of the disposal orbit\nheight distribution will be approximately 200 km. Increasing the manoeuvre\nreliability above the ISO requirement of 0.90 has only a small impact on the\npropellant required.\nFuture applications of this method include evaluation of alternative GEO\ndisposal manoeuvre requirements and using the orbit height distributions to\nestimate collision probabilities. It is straightforward to couple this model with\ndifferent satellite population growth scenarios to quantify the impact of dif-\nferent policy scenarios, for example. The model provides a useful addition to\nthe tools available to evaluate space debris mitigation options.\n16\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n6 Acknowledgements\nContributions by Hedley Stokes, Dean Hope, and William Ailor to discus-\nsions of this topic have been valuable.
