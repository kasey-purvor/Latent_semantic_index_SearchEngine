CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nAbstract. In this paper we determine the group of endotrivial modules for cer-\ntain symmetric and alternating groups in characteristic p. If p = 2, then the group\nis generated by the class of \u2126n(k) except in a few low degrees. If p > 2, then the\ngroup is only determined for degrees less than p2. In these cases we show that\nthere are several Young modules which are endotrivial.\n1. Introduction\nEndotrivial modules play an important role in the modular representation theory\nof finite groups. They are the building blocks of the endo-permutation modules and\nare an essential part of the Picard group of self equivalences of the stable category\nof kG-modules in the case that G is a finite group and k is a field of characteristic\np. A few years ago, the first author and Jacques The\u00b4venaz completed a program\nto classify the endotrivial kG-modules over p-groups [10]. Building on this result,\nBouc [7] has completed a similar program to classify the endo-permutation modules\nover p-groups.\nMore recently, using the classification for p-groups, the authors of this paper\nstarted a project to classify the endotrivial modules over families of finite simple\ngroups and related groups (cf. [8]). For a finite group of Lie type in the defining\ncharacteristic, we have found the structure of the group of endotrivial modules and\nexplicit generators for the group in many cases. The group of endotrivial modules\nis cyclic, generated by the class of the syzygy module \u2126(k), except in the cases that\nthe group has Lie rank 1, or that the Lie rank is 2 and the field of definition of the\ngroup is small.\nThe natural next case, which we introduce with this paper, are the groups of en-\ndotrivial modules for the symmetric and alternating groups. In spite of the advanced\nnature of the representation theory of symmetric groups, determining the torsion in\nthe endotrivial group is considerably more difficult than the case for groups of Lie\ntype. To this point, we have only partial results. In particular, we give complete\nclassifications with generators for the symmetric and the alternating groups, \u03a3n and\nAn, on n letters, in the cases that p = 2, or that p > 2 and n < p\n2.\nDate: November 22, 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20C20, 20C30.\nResearch of the first two authors was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0401431.\nResearch of the third author was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0400548.\n1\n2 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K.

A surprise in the odd characteristic case for\nthe symmetric groups is that there are several Young modules which are endotrivial.\nWe strongly suspect that for p > 2 and n \u2265 p2, the groups T (\u03a3n) and T (An) have\nno torsion, beyond that coming from the sign representation. The torsion free ranks\nof these groups are known from general principals that give us the results stated\nabove. That is, the torsion free rank of T (G) depends only on the number of G-\nconjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of order p2. However,\nwe do not know (yet) how to determine generators for the torsion free part of T (G)\nunless this rank is 1, or, if p = 2 and the Sylow 2-subgroups are dihedral. For our\npurposes, this concerns the groups T (\u03a3n) and T (An) for p \u2265 3 and p2 \u2264 n < p2+ p.\nIn addition, finding the torsion elements of T (\u03a3n) and T (An) for p \u2265 3 and p2 \u2264 n\nhave not been completed as of this writing. We plan to investigate these issues in\nfuture work.\nSeveral of our calculations for small groups relied on the algebra software MAGMA\n(cf. [6]). The computations turned out to be very effective in revealing to us that\nthere are nontrivial endotrivial modules whose class is a torsion element in the\ngroup of endotrivial modules. This led us to understand and prove the underlying\ntheoretical facts.\nWe are grateful to David Hemmer for providing us with several useful insights\nabout symmetric group representations during an Oberwolfach meeting in March\n2006.\n2. Setting\nThroughout the paper, let G be a finite group, usually the symmetric group \u03a3n or\nthe alternating group An acting on the set {1, . . . , n}, for some n, and let k be a field\nof characteristic p which is a splitting field for G and all of its subgroups. For this, it\nis sufficient that k contains all mth roots of unity where m is the order of G. When\ndefining subgroups of the symmetric or alternating groups we assume the natural\nordering on the letters unless otherwise indicated. For example, we write H =\n\u03a3a \u00d7 \u03a3b \u2286 \u03a3n to mean the subgroup where \u03a3a is the collection of all permutations\non {1, . . . , a} and \u03a3b is the set of all permutations in \u03a3n on {a + 1, . . . , a + b}\n(a+ b \u2264 n).\nFor two subgroups H and K of G let [G\/H] denote a complete set of representa-\ntives for the left H-cosets in G and let [H\\G\/K] be a complete set of representatives\nfor the H-K double cosets in G. Normally, we assume that the identity element 1\nof G is one of the representatives, so that [G\/H]\\{1} means a set of representatives\nof the nonidentity cosets.\nWe consider only finitely generated left modules over group algebras. If M is a\nkG-module, we write ResGH M , or M\u2193GH , for the restriction of M to kH where H is\na subgroup of G. If N is another kG-module, we denote by Homk(M,N) the kG-\nmodule of all k-linear maps M \/\/ N . We let EndkM = Homk(M,M) denote the\nk-endomorphism ring of M . The k-dual of M is M\u2217 = Homk(M,k), where k also\ndenotes the trivial kG-module. LetM\u2297N be the tensor product of two modulesM\n4 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nand N over the base field k with diagonal action of the group G. We write M | N\nto mean that the module M is a direct summand of N .\nFor M a kG-module, we denote the kernel of the projective cover P \/\/ M by\n\u2126(M) and the cokernel of the injective hull M \/\/ Q by \u2126\u22121(M). Inductively, we\ndefine for any n > 1, \u2126n(M) = \u2126(\u2126n\u22121(M)) and \u2126\u2212n(M) = \u2126\u22121(\u21261\u2212n(M)). The\ncombinatorics are that (\u2126n(M))\u2217 \u223c= \u2126\u2212n(M\u2217) and that, for any module N , there\nexists a projective module P such that \u2126n(M)\u2297N \u223c= \u2126n(M \u2297N)\u2295 P .\nWe write mod(kG) for the category of all finitely generated kG-modules and\nstmod(kG) for the stable module category, namely the quotient ofmod(kG) by the\nsubcategory of projective modules. That is, the stable category has the same objects\nasmod(kG). For two finitely generated kG-modulesM and N , the morphisms from\nM to N in the stable category are given by\nHomkG(M,N) = HomkG(M,N)\/PHomkG(M,N) ,\nwhere PHomkG(M,N) is the subspace of homomorphisms that factor through a\nprojective module.\nDefinition 2.1. A kG-module M is endotrivial provided EndkM \u223c= k \u2295 (proj), or\nequivalently, EndkM \u223c= k in stmod(kG).\nRecall that Homk(M,N) \u223c= M\u2217 \u2297 N as kG-modules. Consequently, the tensor\nproduct of two endotrivial modules is endotrivial. This allows us to define the group\nof endotrivial modules, whose elements are classes [M ] as follows.\nDefinition 2.2. Two endotrivial kG-modules are equivalent if they are isomorphic\nin stmod(kG). That is, [M ] = [N ] if M\u2295P \u223c= N\u2295Q for projective modules P and\nQ. The group of endotrivial kG-modules is the set T (G) of equivalence classes [M ] of\nendotrivial kG-modulesM , with the operation given by the rule [M ]+[N ] = [M\u2297N ].\nClearly, T (G) is abelian, and we have that 0 = [k] and \u2212[M ] = [M\u2217]. Further-\nmore, if p does not divide the order of G, then every module is projective. In this\ncase, the definition of an endotrivial module does not have much meaning, as every\nobject in the stable category is equivalent to the zero object, and also every module\nis an endotrivial module, by a strict interpretation of the definition. In that case,\nwe set T (G) = {0}.\nThe next theorem collects some useful properties of the group T (G).\nTheorem 2.3. Let G be any finite group. The group T (G) is finitely generated.\nThus, there is a torsion-free subgroup TF (G) of finite rank, such that T (G) \u223c=\nTT (G)\u2295 TF (G), where TT (G) denotes the torsion subgroup of T (G).\n(a) The modules \u2126n(k) are endotrivial and their classes generate a cyclic direct\nsummand of T (G) [1, 11, 12, 10].\n(b) Let n denote the number of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian\np-subgroups of p-rank 2 in G. Then the rank of TF (G) is n if G has p-rank\nat most 2 and is n+ 1 if the p-rank of G is greater than 2 [1, 8].\n(c) If E is an abelian p-group having p-rank at least 2, then T (E) \u223c= Z and is\ngenerated by the class of \u2126(k) [11, 12].\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 5\n(i) If G has p-rank at least 2, then the product of the restriction maps\nRes : TF (G) \/\/\n\u220f\nE T (E)\nfrom TF (G) to all of the elementary abelian p-subgroups E of p-rank 2\nof G, is injective [1, 8].\n(ii) A kG-module is endotrivial if and only if its restriction to every elemen-\ntary abelian p-subgroup of G is endotrivial [10].\n(d) Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n(i) The torsion subgroup TT (P ) is trivial except in the case that P is cyclic,\nquaternion or semidihedral [10].\n(ii) If TT (P ) is trivial, then TT (G) is generated by the classes [M ] of inde-\ncomposable endotrivial kG-modules M such that M\u2193GP \u223c= k\u2295 (proj), for\na projective kP -module (proj) [8]. (Note that in general, a module with\nvertex P and trivial source is not endotrivial.)\n(e) The restriction map ResGH : T (G)\n\/\/ T (H) is injective, provided the sub-\ngroup H of G contains the normalizer of a Sylow p-subgroup of G [8].\nIt follows from (d) in the above theorem that the torsion subgroup TT (P ) of T (P )\nis often trivial. We will show in the next sections that, as a consequence of this,\nthen TT (G) is generated by the equivalence classes of the indecomposable trivial\nsource modules that are endotrivial, for an arbitrary finite group G having a Sylow\np-subgroup isomorphic to P . If G is the symmetric group, it turns out that some of\nthese modules can be found among the Young modules. We refer the reader to [18]\nfor the basic background on the representation theory of the symmetric groups,\nand to [14], [16] and [17] for deeper investigations of the Young modules. Some\ncomputer computations of Young module can be found on the first author\u2019s web\npage (http:\/\/www.math.uga.edu\/\u02dcjfc\/hecke.html).\nDefinition 2.4. Let \u03bb = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbk) be the a partition of n and let G = \u03a3n.\n(a) A Young subgroup \u03a3\u03bb associated to \u03bb is a subgroup of G that is conjugate\nto \u03a3\u03bb1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u03a3\u03bbk .\n(b) The Specht module S\u03bb associated to \u03bb is the kG-module with k-basis the\nset of standards polytabloids (cf. [18]). It is a submodule of the permutation\nmodule M\u03bb = k\u2191G\u03a3\u03bb .\n(c) The Young module Y \u03bb associated to \u03bb is the unique (up to isomorphism)\nindecomposable direct summand of M\u03bb that contains S\u03bb.\nIt should also be mentioned that all of the indecomposable direct summands of\nthe permutation modules M\u03bb are Young modules Y \u00b5 for some partitions \u00b5 which\nare greater than or equal to \u03bb in the dominance ordering. In particular, we will call\nupon the following observation.\nLemma 2.5. Suppose that S is a Young subgroup of G = \u03a3n that contains a Sylow\np-subgroup of G. Suppose that N is an indecomposable kG-module such that N\u2193GS \u223c=\nk \u2295 (proj). Then N is a Young module with vertex a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n6 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nProof. Because S contains a Sylow p-subgroup, N is relatively S-projective. Con-\nsequently, N is a direct summand of N \u2193GS \u2191GS . Since k is a direct summand of\nN\u2193GS , then a vertex of N is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and N is a direct summand\nof k\u2191GS . \u00a4\nRemark 2.6. Note that in the proof of the above lemma, N is a Young module\nsimply because every indecomposable summand of k\u2191GS is a Young module. We can\nnot conclude that N is the Young module corresponding to the same partition as\nthe Young subgroup S. Indeed, the trivial module N = k satisifies the hypotheses\nof the Lemma, even when the subgroup S corresponds to a non-trivial partition.\n3. Some Generalities\nIn this section we present a few general results that will be used in the course of\nthis paper.\nProposition 3.1. Suppose that H is a normal subgroup of G and that p does not\ndivide the index of H in G. Let M be an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module.\nThen M\u2193GH is endotrivial and indecomposable.\nProof. Assume that H is normal in G and that M is an endotrivial indecomposable\nkG-module. Then M\u2193GH \u223c= M0\u2295Q, with M0 an indecomposable endotrivial module\nand Q a projective module. Since p does not divide |G : H|, M is projective relative\nto H and we deduce that M is a direct summand of M0\u2191GH . It follows that M\u2193GH\nis a direct summand of M0\u2191GH\u2193GH \u223c=\n\u2295\ng\u2208[G\/H]\ngM0, since H \/ G. The only way that\nthis can happen is if Q is the zero module. \u00a4\nLemma 3.2. Let H be a subgroup of G that contains a Sylow p-subgroup P of G.\nIf |P | > |G : H|, then the kernel of the restriction map ResGH : T (G) \/\/ T (H) is\ngenerated by the classes of the one dimensional kG-modules M such that M\u2193GH = k.\nIn particular, if G = \u03a3n, H = \u03a3n\u22121, n > 2p and if p - n, then the restriction map\nResGH : T (G)\n\/\/ T (H) is injective. The same applies if G = An and H = An\u22121.\nSimilarly, if p > 2, then the kernel of the restriction map T (\u03a3n) \/\/ T (An) has\norder 2 and is generated by the class of the sign representation.\nProof. Let M be an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module such that M\u2193GH \u223c= k \u2295\n(proj). Then, by relative projectivity and a vertex argument, we have thatM | k\u2191GH .\nSince Dim(k\u2191GH ) = |G : H| < |P |, the kH-module M\u2193GH has no nonzero projective\nsummand. Therefore, Dim(M) = 1.\nAssume that G = \u03a3n and H = \u03a3n\u22121 (resp. G = An and H = An\u22121), with n > 2p.\nAssume also that p - n. Then, the index |G : H| = n < |P |, where P is a common\nSylow p-subgroup of G and H. Hence, Ker(ResGH) consists of the isomorphism\nclasses (in stmod(kH)) of the 1-dimensional kG-modules that restrict trivially to\nH. If G = \u03a3n or G = An, then there is exactly one such module: the trivial\nmodule. Likewise, Ker(Res\u03a3nAn) is generated by the class of the sign representation if\np > 2. \u00a4\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 7\nWe will now provide some general information about the situation when the field\nhas characteristic 2. The following proposition is recorded in [3, Lemma 5.4, Theo-\nrem 5.5].\nProposition 3.3. Suppose that G is a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are\ndihedral. Then G has two conjugacy classes of elementary abelian 2-subgroups of\nrank 2, represented by subgroups E1 and E2. Let P0 be the projective cover of the\ntrivial kG-module k. Then taking the radical modulo the socle of P0 (i.e. the \u201cheart\u201d\nof P0) we get\nRad(P0)\/ Soc(P0) \u223c= M \u2295M\u2217 ,\nwhere M\u2193GE1 \u223c= \u2126(k) and M\u2193GE2 \u223c= \u2126\u22121(k). Hence, M is an endotrivial module and\nTF (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [M ]\u3009 \u223c= Z2.\nMoreover, if a dihedral group D is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, then the restriction map\nResGH : TF (G)\n\/\/ T (D) is an isomorphism.\nProposition 3.3 provides the answer to a question that was left open in [8]. Namely,\nin the case that G =PSL3(F2) (i.e. the finite group of Lie type A2(2)), we have that\nthe Sylow 2-subgroups are dihedral of order 8. In [8, Theorem 8.1], we demonstrated\nthat T (G) \u223c= Z2. Now, the diagram of the projective cover P0 of the trivial module\nis (cf. [5, Section 11])\nk\nM M\u2217\nk\n, with M of dimension 3 .\nSo, we have Rad(P0)\/ Soc(P0) \u223c= M \u2295M\u2217. By Proposition 3.3, M is endotrivial and\nwe have T (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [M ]\u3009.\nWe end this section with a known result about the normalizers of the Sylow 2-\nsubgroups of the symmetric and alternating groups.\nProposition 3.4. Let n be a positive integer.\n(a) The Sylow 2-subgroups of \u03a3n are self normalizing for all n.\n(b) The Sylow 2-subgroups of An are self normalizing for all n \u2265 6.\nProof. This is a result due to Louis Weisner, cf. [21, Corollary 2, Theorem p.124]. \u00a4\n4. The case p = 2\nIn this section, we give a complete characterization of the group T (G) in the case\nthat G = \u03a3n and G = An for p = 2. For each family of groups, we first determine\nthe isomorphism type of T (G), and then describe the generators in detail.\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose that G = \u03a3n and p = 2. Then TT (G) = {0}, for all positive\nintegers n. We have that\nT (G) \u223c= TF (G) \u223c=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 {0} if n \u2264 3 ,Z2 if n = 4, 5 ,Z if n \u2265 6 .\n8 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nProof. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. In this case, N := NG(P ) = P , by\nProposition 3.4. By the classification of endotrivial modules of a p-group (cf. [10]),\nwe know that TT (P ) = {0}. Indeed, P is either cyclic of order 2, dihedral of order\n8, or has all maximal elementary abelian 2-subgroups of 2-rank at least 3, in the\nthree cases. The last statement is an exercise for the reader. If n = 6 or 7, then\nP is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 with a dihedral group of order 8,\nand the conclusion about the ranks of the maximal elementary abelian subgroups is\nobvious. If n = 8 or 9, then P is a wreath product of a dihedral group of order 8 and\na cyclic group of order 2, and again the conclusion holds. For larger n, we always\nhave that P is a direct product of wreath products of Sylow subgroups of smaller\nsymmetric groups.\nBecause N = P , we have that TT (N) = {0}, and so TT (G) = {0}. The result\nfor T (G) is then a direct consequence of Theorem 2.3 and of [8, Corollary 3.2]. \u00a4\nLet us now explore the group T (G) further. First, note that in the theorem, if\nT (G) is cyclic, then T (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009, and this tells us all about T (G), for n \u2265 6 or\nn \u2264 3. When n = 4 or 5, the class [\u2126(k)] generates one summand of T (G), and,\nbecause P is dihedral, there are at least two ways of finding a generator for the other\nsummand. For one we know the structure of the projective cover P0 of the trivial\nmodule k, as in Proposition 3.3. The structure of these modules can be seen from\nthe diagrams in [5]. The other method is to draw on the classical representation\ntheory of the symmetric group, which turns out to be a matter of linear algebra.\nSay P = \u3008x, y | x2 = y2 = (xy)4 = 1\u3009, so that the center of P is generated by the\nelement (xy)2. By [9, Theorem 5.4], we have that T (P ) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [\u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z2,\nwhere \u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k) is the kernel of the map k[P\/\u3008x\u3009] \/\/ k sending each coset u\u3008x\u3009\nto 1, and k[P\/\u3008x\u3009] is the permutation kP -module with k-basis the cosets of P\/\u3008x\u3009,\non which P acts by left multiplication.\nOn the other hand, the Specht module S(3,1) has dimension 3 and we can take as\nk-basis the set of (3, 1)-polytabloids, i.e. the row equivalence classes of the standard\n(3, 1)-tableaux. We refer the reader to [18] for the details.\nA direct computation shows that the kP -modules S(3,1) \u2193GP and \u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k) are\nisomorphic, and hence it proves that\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [S(3,1)]\u3009 .\nLet us now consider G = \u03a35 and let G\n\u2032 = \u03a34 < G. Then, by [20, Lemma 1.5], we\nhave that S(3,1)\u2191GG\u2032 \u223c= S(4,1) \u2295 M , where M is an extension\n0 \/\/ S(3,1,1) \/\/ M \/\/ S(3,2) \/\/ 0 .\nThus, M has dimension 11, and is the Green correspondent of S(3,1) over kG. It\nis also the Green correspondent of \u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k). Thus, by [3, \u00a76], we have that M is\nendotrivial and M\u2193GP \u223c= \u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k)\u2295 kP . This shows that\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [M ]\u3009 ,\nwhere M is the above module.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 9\nFor the alternating groups we have the following. Again, the case of n \u2264 3 is\ntrivial, since then 2 does not divide the order of An.\nTheorem 4.2. Suppose that G = An, the alternating group on n letters, and p = 2.\nThe group of endotrivial modules has the form\nT (G) \u223c=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n{0} if n \u2264 3\nZ\u2295 (Z\/3Z) if n = 4, 5,\nZ2 if n = 6, 7,\nZ if n \u2265 8.\nProof. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. If n = 4 or 5, then P is isomorphic to\na Klein four group and the normalizer N of P has the form P o C3, where C3 is a\ncyclic group of order 3. Hence TF (G) = TF (N) \u223c= Z and so\nT (N) = TF (N)\u2295 TT (N) \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/3Z) .\nIndeed, since k is a splitting field for N , the group TT (N) identifies with the char-\nacter group of N , which is isomorphic to Z\/3Z. Now, in both cases, P is a TI\n(trivial intersection) subgroup of G. That is, if x \u2208 G and x \/\u2208 NG(P ), then\nxPx\u22121 \u2229 P = {1}. In such a situation, the stable module categories stmod(kG)\nand stmod(kN) are equivalent, by the induction and restriction functors, and these\nfunctors induce isomorphisms T (G) \u223c= T (N) (cf. [8, Proposition 2.8]). Hence we\nhave that T (G) \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/3Z).\nFor n > 5, the Sylow 2-subgroups P of G are self normalizing (cf. Proposition 3.4).\nConsequently, there are no nontrivial one dimensional representations of the nor-\nmalizer N = P of P . It follows that TT (G) = TT (N) = {0}. In the cases that\nn = 6 or 7, the Sylow 2-subgroups are dihedral of order 8 and hence we have that\nT (G) = TF (G) \u223c= Z2, by Theorem 2.3. In all other cases, G has no maximal\nelementary abelian 2-subgroup of rank 2. \u00a4\nAs for the symmetric group, let us look for the additional generator of TF (An)\nneeded when n = 6, 7. For this, we use Proposition 3.3, since P is dihedral,\nand we consider the diagrams of the projective cover of the trivial module given\nin [4, Appendix pp. 206 and 213]. It turns out that there are endotrivial modules\nof dimension 19 if n = 6, and of dimension 35 if n = 7 that are the kAn-Green\ncorrespondents of the kP -module \u2126P\/\u3008x\u3009(k), as defined above. In particular, we\nobserve that the restriction map ResGP : T (G)\n\/\/ T (P ) is an isomorphism.\n5. The case n < 2p, for p \u2265 3\nFrom this point on we assume that p \u2265 3 (i.e. p is an odd prime). Notice first\nthat if n < p then p does not divide the order of G = \u03a3n, nor of An, and every\nmodule is projective. Thus, T (G) = {0} if n < p, as mentioned in Section 2. We\nnow consider the case when p \u2264 n < 2p.\nProposition 5.1. Let G = \u03a3n, and let N = NG(P ), where P is a Sylow p-subgroup\nof G.\n10 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\n(a) If n = p or n = p+ 1, then\nT (G) = TT (G) \u223c= TT (N) \u223c= Z\/2(p\u2212 1)Z.\n(b) If n = p+ b, with 1 < b < p, then\nT (G) = TT (G) \u223c= TT (N) \u223c= Z\/2(p\u2212 1)Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z).\nProof. Suppose that p \u2264 n < 2p. Then P is cyclic of order p, and so T (P ) =\nTT (P ) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z\/2Z. The subgroup P is a TI subgroup of G. Hence the\nrestriction functor induces an isomorphism T (G) \u223c= T (N) (cf. [8, Proposition 2.8]).\nIn the case that n = p or n = p+ 1, we have that N \u223c= Cp oCp\u22121, and TT (N) \u223c=\nZ\/2(p \u2212 1)Z, since we assume that k is a splitting field for N . That is, by a\nroutine calculation it can be shown that \u21262(k) is a one dimensional kN -module\nwhich is a generator for the multiplicative group of one dimensional kN -modules\n(one dimensional characters of N). Consequently, the class of \u2126(k) generates a\ncyclic subgroup of order 2(p \u2212 1) in T (N). But this must be all of T (N) since\nwe know that the kernel of the restriction map from T (N) to T (P ) is the group\ngenerated by the one dimensional kN -modules and that T (P ) has order 2.\nWhen n = p + b, for an integer 1 < b < p, we have that N \u223c= (Cp o Cp\u22121) \u00d7 \u03a3b,\nand so TT (N) \u223c= Z\/2(p \u2212 1)Z \u2295 (Z\/2Z), where the Z\/2Z factor is the subgroup\ngenerated by the class of the inflation of the sign representation of \u03a3b to N . \u00a4\nSimilar arguments apply to the alternating groups, and they lead us to the fol-\nlowing result.\nProposition 5.2. Let A = An, and let NA = NA(P ), where P is a Sylow p-subgroup\nof A.\n(a) If n = p or n = p+ 1, then\nT (A) = TT (A) \u223c= TT (NA) \u223c= Z\/(p\u2212 1)Z.\n(b) If n = p+ b, with 1 < b < p, then\nT (A) = TT (A) \u223c= TT (NA) \u223c= Z\/2(p\u2212 1)Z.\nProof. We have, as above, T (P ) = TT (P ) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z\/2Z. Because P is a TI\nsubgroup of A, we get that T (A) \u223c= T (NA). Now, embed A into G = \u03a3p+b and\nconsider N = NG(P ) as in the previous proposition. By Lemma 3.2, the restriction\nmap T (N) \/\/ T (NA) has kernel equal to Z\/2Z. That is, the class of the sign\nrepresentation is the only nontrivial element of the kernel. In the case that b = 0, 1,\nwe get immediately that T (NA) \u223c= Z\/(p \u2212 1)Z as asserted. Now suppose that\n1 < b < p. Then, N \u223c= (CpoCp\u22121)\u00d7\u03a3b. Let J = An\u2229\u03a3b where here, the \u03a3b means\nthe \u03a3b factor in N as we have expressed it. Note first that J is in the kernel of every\none dimensional representation of NA since it is in the commutator subgroup of \u03a3b.\nHence, T (NA\/J) \u223c= T (NA) by the inflation map. But now NA\/J \u223c= CpoCp\u22121. This\nproves the last statement. \u00a4\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 11\n6. The case n = ap, for an integer 2 \u2264 a < p\nWe begin this section with the description of the p-local group structure of the\ngroups G = \u03a3n and A = An, in the case that 2p \u2264 n < p2. Write n = ap + b, with\n2 \u2264 a < p and 0 \u2264 b < p. Note that p must be an odd prime. We assume that\nG acts on the set {1, . . . , n}. Let P be a common Sylow p-subgroup of G and of A\nhaving the form\nP = \u3008 (1, . . . , p), (p+ 1, . . . , 2p), . . . , ((a\u2212 1)p+ 1, . . . , ap) \u3009\nand let N = NG(P ) be the normalizer of P in G and NA = NA(P ) = N \u2229 A. For\nsimplicity, if X \u2286 G, we denote by XA the intersection X \u2229 A.\nLet us describe certain subgroups of G. We leave it to the reader to determine\nthe structure of the corresponding subgroups for the alternating groups. The group\nP is elementary abelian of p-rank a, and N \u223c= Np o \u03a3a \u00d7 \u03a3b, where Np \u223c= Cp o Cp\u22121\nis the normalizer in \u03a3p of a Sylow p-subgroup of \u03a3p. Here, \u201co\u201d denotes the wreath\nproduct, and for a positive integer `, we denote by C` a (multiplicative) cyclic group\nof order `. We will also use the notation Xa for the direct product of a copies of\na group X. Let S denote the Young subgroup containing P and corresponding to\nthe partition (p, . . . , p, b) of n. Then H = NS is the normalizer of S in G and it is\nisomorphic to \u03a3p o \u03a3a \u00d7 \u03a3b.\nHence, we have the following (3-dimensional) diagram of the inclusions of these\nsubgroups (with obvious identifications of the subgroups of G):\nG\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\nH\nrrr\nrrr\nrrr\nrrr\n\u03a3ap H\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\nj\nJJJ\nJJJ\nJJJ\nJJJ\n\u03a3p o \u03a3a S\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njj\nIII\nIII\nIII\nII N\n(\u03a3p)\na\nKKK\nKKK\nKKK\nK\nN\u03a3ap(P ) (Np)\na \u00d7 \u03a3b\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\njjjj\nj\n(Np)\na\nP\nIn this section, we consider the case in which n = ap, for an integer 2 \u2264 a < p.\nFor convenience, we will denote by NS = NS(P ) \u223c= (Np)a.\nBecause P is elementary abelian of p-rank at least 2, TT (P ) is trivial. Thus,\nTT (N) and TT (NA) are generated by the isomorphism classes of 1-dimensional\nkN - and kNA-modules, respectively, by Theorem 2.3. Since the arguments for A\nand for G are alike, we will only work through the case of the symmetric group\n12 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nand state the corresponding results for the alternating groups, without rewriting\nthe reasoning.\nFrom N \u223c= Np o \u03a3a, we deduce that TT (N) \u223c= Z\/(p \u2212 1)Z \u2295 (Z\/2Z), where the\nZ\/(p\u2212 1)Z and Z\/2Z factors correspond to the subgroups generated by the k-linear\ncharacters of Np and by the sign representation of \u03a3a respectively.\nLet X be a kN -module of dimension one, and let Y be the kH-Green correspon-\ndent of X. This makes sense because N \u2286 H. Then let XNS = X\u2193NNS , and since\nNS = NS(P ), it makes sense to consider the kS-Green correspondent YS of XNS .\nMatching the modules with the corresponding groups, we get the following pictures\n(where the double headed dotted arrows stand for the Green correspondence between\nthe indicated modules and groups)\nG\nH\n||\n||\n||\n||\nCC\nCC\nCC\nCC\nS\nAA\nAA\nAA\nAA\nN\n||\n||\n||\n||\nNS\nP\n?\nY bb\n(H,N)\n\"\"\nYS aa\n(S,NS)\n!!\nX\n\u2193NNS\nXNS\n\u2193NSP\nk\nOur aim now is to limit the choices for the module YS.\nLemma 6.1. If Y is an endotrivial kH-module, then YS is an endotrivial kS-module\nand Y \u2193HS \u223c= YS.\nProof. By a property of the Green correspondence Y is a direct summand of the\ninduced module X\u2191HN . Thus, using the Mackey formula and the equality H = NS,\nwe get that Y \u2193HS is a direct summand of\nX\u2191HN\u2193HS \u223c=\n\u2295\ng\u2208[S\\H\/N ]\ngX\u2193 gNgN\u2229S\u2191SgN\u2229S = XNS\u2191SNS \u223c= YS \u2295 Z\nwhere Z is a direct sum of indecomposable kS-modules each having vertex strictly\ncontained in P . We remind the reader that [S\\H\/N ] is a complete set of represen-\ntative of the S-N double cosets in H. Since Y is indecomposable with vertex P , its\nrestriction Y \u2193HS to S must have YS as direct summand. Consequently, if we assume\nthat Y is endotrivial, then YS must also be endotrivial and the other direct sum-\nmands appearing in the decomposition of Y \u2193HS are projective. That is, because Y is\nendotrivial, its restriction to S is endotrivial and can have only one non-projective\nindecomposable component. Now, the facts that S \/ H and p - |H : S| imply, by\nProposition 3.1, that Y \u2193HS \u223c= YS. \u00a4\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 13\nBy the contrapositive of the lemma, if YS is not endotrivial, then neither is Y . So\nwe are down to the question of finding criteria for YS to be endotrivial. This is the\nmain result of the section.\nProposition 6.2. The module YS is endotrivial if and only if Dim(YS) = 1.\nProof. The \u201cif\u201d part is clear. So now assume that YS is endotrivial. Let K =\nNp\u00d7\u03a3pa\u22121 \u2286 G, where the ith-factor \u03a3p acts on {ip+1, . . . , (i+1)p}, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 a\u22121\nand where Np is the normalizer of \u3008(1 . . . p)\u3009 in the subgroup \u03a3p of S that acts on\n{1, . . . , p}. Thus, we have NS < K < S. Because YS is an endotrivial module,\nwe may write YS \u2193SK \u223c= U \u2295 V for kK-modules U and V with U indecomposable\nendotrivial and V projective. Moreover, the Green correspondence implies that\nU\u2193KNS \u223c= XNS \u2295W for some projective kNS-module W (since U is endotrivial). We\nalso have that U is a direct summand of XNS\u2191KNS . Moreover,\nXNS\u2191KNS\u2193KNS \u223c= XNS \u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[NS\\K\/NS ]\\{1}\ngXNS\u2193\ngNS\ngNS\u2229NS\u2191NSgNS\u2229NS .\nSince the largest normal p-subgroup Op(K) of K is nontrivial and is contained in\nNS, none of the indecomposable factors of the right hand side is projective. From\nthe fact that U is endotrivial, we deduce that U\u2193KNS \u223c= XNS . Therefore, Dim(U) = 1.\nNow, YS is a direct summand of U\u2191SK , by the Green correspondence, which applies\nsince NS \u2286 K. Therefore, YS\u2193SK is a direct summand of\nU\u2191SK\u2193SK \u223c= U \u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[K\\S\/K]\\{1}\ngU\u2193 gKgK\u2229K\u2191KgK\u2229K .\nAgain, g runs over a set of representatives of the K-K-double cosets in S, such\nthat g 6\u2208 K. Now, notice that we may take for K-coset representatives [S\/K] in S\nthe Np-cosets representatives [\u03a3p\/Np] in \u03a3p of the corresponding normal subgroups\nof S and K respectively. Thus, we may assume that every coset representative\ncentralizes the subgroup (\u03a3p)\na\u22121 of K. It follows that every intersection gK \u2229K ,\nfor g \u2208 [K\\S\/K] contains a nontrivial p-subgroup. Hence, the right hand side in\nthe displayed isomorphism does not contain any projective summands. Since YS is\nendotrivial, we deduce that YS\u2193SK \u223c= U . Hence Dim(YS) = 1 as claimed. \u00a4\nThe last two results have an immediate consequence.\nCorollary 6.3. LetM be an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module (where G = \u03a3ap\n2 \u2264 a < p) whose class belongs to the torsion subgroup TT (G). Then, M \u2193GH \u223c=\nY \u2295 (proj), where Y is an endotrivial kH-module of dimension 1.\nBy very similar arguments for the alternating group A = Aap, with 2 \u2264 a < p, we\nprove the following.\nCorollary 6.4. Let M be an indecomposable endotrivial kA-module whose class\nbelongs to the torsion subgroup TT (A). Then, M\u2193AHA \u223c= Y \u2295 (proj), where Y is an\nendotrivial kHA-module of dimension 1.\n14 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\n7. The case n = 2p\nIn this section, we apply the results of Section 6 in the case that G = \u03a32p and\nA = A2p. As noted, T (P ) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z. We assume the notation of Section 6 for\nG and for A, and since the reasonings for A and for G are alike, we only give the\ndetails for G and leave the alternating case as exercise for the reader.\nBy [2, 6.1-2] the subgroup H is strongly p-embedded in G, that is gH \u2229 H is a\np\u2032-group for any g \u2208 G \\ H. Therefore, for any kH-module Y of dimension 1 we\nhave that\nY \u2191GH\u2193GP \u223c= Y \u2193HP \u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[P\\G\/H]\\{1}\ngY \u2193 gHgH\u2229P\u2191PgH\u2229P = k\u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[P\\G\/H]\\{1}\nk\u2191PgH\u2229P = k\u2295(proj) ,\nwhere the sums are over representatives of the nonidentity P -H-double cosets. The\nisomorphism holds because for g \/\u2208 H the intersection gH \u2229 P is trivial. Moreover,\nthe one dimensional modules for H \u223c= \u03a3p o\u03a32 form a Klein four group. We may take\nfor generators the kH-modules \u03b5H and Y = k\u03a3p o \u03b5\u03a32 , where \u03b5K denotes the sign\nrepresentation of the group K.\nObserve that the isomorphism Y \u2193HS \u223c= k forces the kG-Green correspondent M of\nY to be the Young module Y (p,p), associated to the partition (p, p) of 2p. Indeed, M\nis an indecomposable nontrivial direct summand with vertex P of the permutation\nmodule k\u2191GS (cf. [18] and [14]).\nProposition 7.1. Let G = \u03a32p for p an odd prime. Then any one dimensional\nkH-module induced to G is endotrivial. The group T (G) is given by\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [\u03b5G], [Y (p,p)]\u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z)2 .\nUsing this result we get the following.\nProposition 7.2. Let A = A2p for p an odd prime. Then any one dimensional\nkHA-module, when induced to A, is endotrivial. The group T (A) is given by\nT (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [Y (p,p)\u2193GA ], [M ]\u3009 \u223c=\n{\nZ\u2295 (Z\/2Z)2 if p > 3\nZ\u2295 (Z\/4Z) if p = 3\nwhere M is an indecomposable endotrivial kA-module such that M\u2191GA is indecom-\nposable.\nThe last claim above comes from the nature of the 1-dimensional kHA-modules.\nNamely, if E \u223c= Ap\u00d7Ap then E \u2286 H and is also a subgroup of HA. It is easy to see\nthat the restriction of any one dimensional kHA-module Y to E is trivial. Thus, Y\nis a k[HA\/E]-module. Since the quotient H\/E is a dihedral group of order 8 and\nHA has index 2 in H, we have either that Y extends to H, or that the induction\nY \u2191HHA is indecomposable. In the first case, this means that Y is the restriction of a\nkH-module, and so we get Y (p,p)\u2193GA as kA-Green correspondent. Otherwise, Y \u2191HHA\nis indecomposable, which implies that the kA-Green correspondent M of Y has the\nproperty that M\u2191GA is indecomposable. We refer the reader to Section 8 for further\ndetails on the structure of M .\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 15\nNote that, if p = 3, then HA\/E is cyclic of order 4, and so TT (A) \u223c= TT (HA) \u223c=\nZ\/4Z, since we assume that k is a splitting field for HA. In particular, this shows\nthat Y (p,p)\u2193GA \u223c= M \u2297M in stmod(kA).\nBefore leaving this case we record the following fact for later application.\nProposition 7.3. For the group H = \u03a3p o \u03a32, we have that\nTT (H) = \u3008[\u03b5H ], [Y ]\u3009 \u223c= (Z\/2Z)2\nwhere \u03b5H is the sign representation on H and Y is the one dimensional module on\nwhich \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p acts trivially and \u03a32 acts by the sign representation.\nProof. It is clear that \u03b5H and Y are endotrivial modules, and moreover, they gener-\nate the group of one dimensional kH-modules. The only question is whether there\nare other endotrivial modules generating TT (H). So, suppose that U is an indecom-\nposable endotrivial kH-module whose restriction to P is isomorphic to k \u2295 (proj).\nBy Lemma 6.1 and Proposition 6.2, the kS-module U \u2193HS is an indecomposable\nendotrivial module and has dimension 1. Hence the class [U ] is in the subgroup of\nT (G) genereated by \u03b5H and [Y ]. \u00a4\n8. Case n = 2p+ b for 0 < b < p\nIn this section, we consider the cases G = \u03a32p+b and A = A2p+b, for an integer b\nwith 0 < b < p. Throughout this section we use the notation for G and for A given\nat the beginning of Section 6.\nAgain, TF (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 and TF (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 are infinite cyclic, because the\nSylow p-subgroup P is elementary abelian of order p2. By Theorem 2.3, since\nT (P ) is torsion-free, the groups TT (G) and TT (A) are generated by the classes\nof indecomposable modules whose restriction to N = NG(P ) and NA respectively,\nare isomorphic to the direct sum of a one dimensional module and a projective\nmodule. In the case of the symmetric group, we show that these modules are Young\nmodules, or the sign representation. Then, we will easily deduce a set of generators\nfor T (G). The situation for the alternating groups is more complicated and hence it\nis handled separately. Before splitting the question into subcases, we point out the\nfollowing fact which shows that TT (G) and TT (A) have at most order 4.\nLemma 8.1. In the above notation, the restriction maps ResG\u03a32p : T (G)\n\/\/ T (\u03a32p)\nand ResAA2p : T (A)\n\/\/ T (A2p) are injective, for all 1 \u2264 b \u2264 p\u2212 1.\nProof. The proof is immediate, by the transitivity of the restriction map and by\nLemma 3.2.\n\u00a4\nAt this point, we handle separately the groups G and A, and for simplicity, we\nstart with G. Namely, we exhibit a nontrivial endotrivial module whose class is in\nTT (G), and this will prove that TT (G) is a Klein four group.\nFor convenience, let us set Gb = \u03a32p+b, Hb for the subgroup of the form (\u03a3p o\u03a32)\u00d7\n\u03a3b, and Sb \u223c= \u03a32p \u00d7 \u03a3b, for 0 \u2264 b < p (cf. Section 6).\n16 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nLet H and Y be as in Proposition 7.3. We identify H with the quotient Hb\/\u03a3b,\nand let Y\u02dc and \u03b5\u02dcH be the inflations of Y and \u03b5H to Hb, respectively. Since Y\u02dc \u2193HbSb = k,\nthe kGb-Green correspondent V of Y\u02dc is isomorphic to a direct summand of the\npermutation module M (p,p,b) = k\u2191GbSb (cf. Lemma 2.5). Hence V is a Young module\nof the form Y \u03bb for some partition \u03bb with \u03bb D (p, p, b). By [14, Theorem 2], the\nYoung module Y \u03bb associated to a partition \u03bb of n is projective if and only if \u03bb is\np-restricted. A partition \u03bb = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbs) of a positive integer n is p-restricted (or\np-column regular) if \u03bbi\u2212\u03bbi+1 < p, for all 1 \u2264 i < s, and if \u03bbs < p. This restricts the\nnumber of possible endotrivial modules among all the Young modules.\nProposition 8.2. Let Gb = \u03a32p+b for an integer b such that 0 < b < p. Consider\nthe same notation as above and as in the Proposition 7.3. Let \u00b5 be the partition\n(p+ b, p) of n. Then we have the following.\n(a) The Young module Y \u00b5 is endotrivial.\n(b) The kG-Green correspondent of \u03b5\u02dcH is not endotrivial, and so\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [\u03b5G], [Y \u00b5], \u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z)2 , \u2200 0 \u2264 b < p .\nProof. Let us first observe that (b) follows immediately from (a), as noted above in\nLemma 8.1, and by Proposition 7.1. Hence, the only thing we need to show is that\nY \u00b5 is endotrivial.\nWe proceed by induction on b. We know that the result holds for b = 0, by\nProposition 7.1. Assume b \u2265 1. We apply Theorem 5.1 in [17]. In the notation\nof Henke\u2019s article (where k is an index, and not the underlying field), we have\nr = 2p+ b, k = p and t(k) = 0, for all 0 < b < p. Thus, again in Henke\u2019s notation,\nVp = 0, implying that\nResGbGb\u22121 Y\n\u00b5 \u223c= Y (p+b\u22121,p) \u2295\n{\nY (p+b,p\u22121) , if 0 < b < p\u2212 1\n0 , if b = p\u2212 1 .\nNow, the partition (p + b, p \u2212 1) of 2p + b \u2212 1 is p-restricted for all integers b such\nthat 0 < b < p \u2212 1. In these cases, the kGb\u22121-module Y (p+b,p\u22121) is projective\n(cf. [14, Theorem 2]), and Y (p+b\u22121,p) is endotrivial by the induction hypothesis and\nby Proposition 7.1. If b = p\u2212 1, then the kGb\u22121-module Y (2p\u22122,p) is not projective,\nsince the partition (2p \u2212 2, p) is not p-restricted. However, it is isomorphic to the\nSpecht module S(2p\u22122,p), by the computation of [13, (2.6)]. Then, applying the\nmodular branching rules (cf. [20]), the restricted kGb\u22122-module Res\nGb\u22121\nGb\u22122 S\n(2p\u22122,p) is\nstill indecomposable, and hence, it is isomorphic to the Young module Y (2p\u22123,p),\nwhich is endotrivial by the induction hypothesis. This shows that the Young kGb-\nmodule we started with, namely Y (2p\u22121,p) is endotrivial. This completes the case for\nthe symmetric groups. \u00a4\nWe now turn to the alternating groups. Let us first consider the group A = A2p+1.\nWrite G = \u03a32p+1, G0 = \u03a32p, A0 = A2p, H = \u03a3p o \u03a32, HA = H \u2229 A, S =\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 17\n\u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p, SA = S \u2229 A and V = Ap \u00d7 Ap.

Since the quotient\nH\/V is a dihedral group of order 8, there is a simple kH-module U of dimension 2,\nwhose restrictions to HA and S split as a direct sum of two nonisomorphic modules.\nThat is, a direct summand UA of U\u2193HHA is a 1-dimensional module whose kA-Green\ncorrespondent might be endotrivial. We prove that this is indeed the case.\nObserve that, by Proposition 7.2, the kA0-Green correspondent of UA is endotriv-\nial, and hence, the kG0-Green correspondent of U restricts to A0 as a direct sum\nof two nonisomorphic endotrivial modules. On the other hand, a direct summand\nUS of U \u2193HS is isomorphic to the outer tensor product k\u03a3p \u2297 \u03b5\u03a3p as k\u03a3p \u2297 k\u03a3p-\nmodule (recall that S = \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3p). Consequently, the induced module US \u2191GS\nhas a direct summand which is the signed Young module Y (p+1|p) in the nota-\ntion of [15]. Roughly, the signed Young k\u03a3n-module Y\n(a|b) is defined as a cer-\ntain uniquely determined indecomposable direct summand of the signed permuta-\ntion module M (a|b) = (1\u03a3a \u2297 \u03b5\u03a3b)\u2191\u03a3n\u03a3a\u00d7\u03a3b , for a 2-parts partition (a, b) of n. Now,\nby [15, Proposition 3.6.1], we have that Y (p+1|p) \u223c= S(p+1,1p), for the (ordinary) Specht\nmodule. By property of the Green correspondence (or by [19, 7.6]), we have that\nS(p+1,1\np)\u2193GA \u223c= M\u2295 cM , for two nonisomorphic kA-modulesM and cM , and where we\nmay assume that M is the kA-Green correspondent of UA. Upon restriction to G0\nand by the modular branching rules (cf. [20, Lemma 1.5]), we have that S(p+1,1\np)\u2193GG0\nis an indecomposable module isomorphic to a nonsplit extension X given by the\nexact sequence\n0 \/\/ S(p,1\np) \/\/ X \/\/ S(p+1,1\np\u22121) \/\/ 0\nand X is isomorphic to the kG0-Green correspondent of U . Also, X is isomorphic to\nthe signed Young module Y (p|p), andX\u2193G0A0 \u223c= M0\u2295 cM0, withM0 and cM0 endotrivial\nand nonisomorphic. Relating to the above picture of inclusion of subgroups of G, we\ncan summarize the situation into a diagram (where the double headed dotted arrows\n18 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K.

This proves the following.\nProposition 8.3. Let A = A2p+1 and G = \u03a32p+1. Then,\nT (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [Y (p+1,p)\u2193GA ], [M ]\u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z)2 ,\nwhere M is an indecomposable direct summand of the restriction to A of the Specht\nkG-module S(p+1,1\np). Moreover, M\u2193AA2p is indecomposable.\nLet us now consider the group A = A2p+2. Then A contains a group G\n\u2032 isomorphic\nto \u03a32p, and A is contained in G = \u03a32p+2. We show the following.\nLemma 8.4. The restriction map ResAG\u2032 : T (A)\n\/\/ T (G\u2032) is injective and the cok-\nernel has order 2, generated by the class of the sign representation \u03b5G\u2032 of G\n\u2032.\nProof. Let M be an indecomposable endotrivial kA-module such that M\u2193AG\u2032 \u223c= k \u2295\n(proj). By relative projectivity and a vertex argument, we deduce thatM is a direct\nsummand of k\u2191AG\u2032 . Thus, M is a direct summand of\nk\u2191GG\u2032\u2193GA \u223c= M (2p,1,1)\u2193GA , since G\u2032 \u223c= \u03a32p \u2286 G .\nNow, M (2p,1,1) \u223c= \u2295\u00b5Y \u00b5 for some partitions \u00b5 of 2p + 2 such that \u00b5 D (2p, 1, 1).\nThus, M is a direct summand of Y \u00b5 for some such \u00b5. SinceM has vertex a Sylow p-\nsubgroup and is a trivial source module, it must be that Y \u00b5 has complexity 2. By [16,\nTheorem 3.3.2], this leaves us with only two candidates, namely Y (2p+2) = k, whose\nGreen correspondent is the trivial module, and Y (2p+1,1) \u223c= S(2p+1,1) (the Specht\nmodule corresponding to the natural permutation representation of G). In the\nsecond case, it is known that the restriction of S(2p+1,1) to A is indecomposable\n(cf. [19, 7.6]) and has dimension 2p + 1 (cf. [18]). Therefore, the latter has no\nendotrivial summand. This proves the injectivity of the restriction map ResAG\u2032 .\nThe statement for the cokernel can be proved by using a argument similar to the\none used to verify the injectivity of the restriction. Indeed, let M be an indecom-\nposable endotrivial kA-module such that M \u2193AG\u2032 \u223c= \u03b5G\u2032 \u2295 (proj). Then, we notice\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR THE SYMMETRIC AND ALTERNATING GROUPS 19\nthat M does not extend to G. Otherwise, we would have that M = N \u2193GA for N\nan indecomposable endotrivial kG-module, which would be one of the modules \u03b5G,\nY (p+2,p) or \u03b5G\u2297Y (p+2,p). But \u03b5G\u2193GG\u2032 \u223c= \u03b5G\u2193GA\u2193AG\u2032 = k and Y (p+2,p)\u2193GG\u2032 \u223c= Y (p,p)\u2295 (proj),\nby transitivity of the restriction. Thus, M\u2191GA\u2193GA \u223c= M \u2295 cM , with M 6\u223c= cM . Thus,\ncM\u2193AG\u2032 \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) and so, by the above argument, we conclude that if such an M\nexists, then M has dimension 1. Hence, M does not exist, as was to be shown. \u00a4\nNow Lemmas 3.2 and 8.4 imply the following.\nProposition 8.5. Let A = A2p+b and G = \u03a32p+b, for an integer b with 1 < b < p.\nThen T (A) is the image of the restriction map ResGA : T (G)\n\/\/ T (A) , that is\nT (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)] , [Y (p+b,p)\u2193GA ]\u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z) .\n9. Case n = ap+ b for 3 \u2264 a < p and 0 \u2264 b < p\nIn this section we determine T (G) and T (A) for all groups G = \u03a3ap+b and A =\nAap+b, such that 3 \u2264 a < p and 0 \u2264 b < p. As in most of the work, the two can\nbe handled alike, and in order to avoid repetitions, we state the results for both\ngroups and we only make explicit the reasoning for the symmetric groups, leaving\nthe translation to the alternating group as an exercise for the reader.\nAgain we have that T (P ) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z, since P is an elementary abelian group\nof p-rank a. We begin with the case that b = 0.\nProposition 9.1. Let G = \u03a3ap and A = Aap, for an integer a such that 3 \u2264 a < p.\nThen\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [\u03b5G]\u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z) and T (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z .\nProof. By Proposition 7.3, we have that TT (H) = \u3008[\u03b5H ], [Y ]\u3009 \u223c= (Z\/2Z)2, where Y =\nk\u03a3p o\u03b5\u03a3a . We also know from Theorem 2.3 that the map ResGH : TT (G) \/\/ TT (H)\nis injective. Note that the kG-Green correspondent of \u03b5H is \u03b5G, which is endotrivial.\nLet M be the kG-Green correspondent of Y . The only question is whether M is\nendotrivial. Note also that Y \u2193HS \u223c= k implies that M is a Young module that is a\nnontrivial direct summand with vertex P of the permutation module M\u03bb = k\u2191GS ,\nwhere \u03bb = (p, . . . , p).\nLet U = \u03a3p \u00d7 \u03a3(a\u22121)p be the subgroup of G containing S, with \u03a3p acting on\n{1, . . . , p} and \u03a3(a\u22121)p on {p + 1, . . . , ap}. We set K = U \u2229H \u223c= \u03a3p \u00d7\n(\n\u03a3p o \u03a3(a\u22121)\n)\nand L = K \u2229N . Hence, L = NU(P ) and S \u2286 K.\nAssume that M is endotrivial. Then, M\u2193GU =MU \u2295 (proj) for an indecomposable\nendotrivial kU -module MU , and M\u2193GK \u223c= YK \u2295 (proj), where YK = Y \u2193HK . By transi-\ntivity of the restriction, we deduce then that MU\u2193UK \u223c= YK \u2295 (proj). More precisely,\nYK and MU are Green correspondents, since K \u2287 L = NU(P ). In particular, MU is\na direct summand of YK\u2191UK , and by the Mackey formula,\nYK\u2191UK\u2193UK \u223c= YK \u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[K\\U\/K]\\{1}\ngYK\u2193 gKgK\u2229K\u2191KgK\u2229K .\n20 JON CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nBy choice of the subgroups U and K, we have that p divides | gK\u2229K|, for any g \u2208 U ,\nand so the right hand side has no projective summand. Therefore, MU\u2193UK \u223c= YK . In\nparticular, MU has dimension one.\nIn addition, since p does not divide |G : U |, the kG-module M is a nonprojective\nmodule that is relatively projective to U . Hence, M\u2193GU is a direct summand of\nMU\u2191GU\u2193GU \u223c= MU \u2295\n\u2295\ng\u2208[U\\G\/U ]\\{1}\ngMU\u2193 gUgU\u2229U\u2191UgU\u2229U .\nNote that p divides | gU \u2229 U |, for all g \u2208 G, since the intersection gU \u2229 U contains\na subgroup \u03a3(a\u22122)p for all g \u2208 G. Therefore, the right-hand side has no projective\nsummand. Hence, the assumptionM\u2193GU =MU\u2295(proj) implies thatM\u2193GU =MU , and\nsoM has dimension one. Since the only one dimensional kG-modules are isomorphic\nto k or \u03b5G, we have proved the claim for G.\nNow, for A, we observe that the same arguments as for G work. This implies that\nTT (A) is trivial, since there is no nontrivial 1-dimensional kA-module. \u00a4\nWe now apply Lemma 8.1 in order to determine the endotrivial modules in the\nremaining cases.\nCorollary 9.2. Let G = \u03a3ap+b and A = Aap+b for 3 \u2264 a < p and 0 \u2264 b < p. Then\nT (G) = \u3008[\u2126(k)], [\u03b5G]\u3009 \u223c= Z\u2295 (Z\/2Z) and T (A) = \u3008[\u2126(k)]\u3009 \u223c= Z .\nReferences\n[1] J. Alperin, A construction of endo-permutation modules, J.
