Doi: 10.1109\/IGARSS.2009.5417570Metadata only entryTo assist the representation of phenology in vegetation models we created several templates of phenology-driver relations by characterizing the annual phase differences between phenology and two phenology drivers.

Four phase ranges were identified for phenology-radiation and three phase ranges for phenology-precipitation. These ranges were classified and mapped together into 12 zones of our study area where particular phase relationships coincided. Around ~25% area was in phase with radiation, with varying phase ranges of precipitation, and ~16 % was in phase with precipitation with varying phase ranges of radiation. For each zone we conceptualized the phenology-driver relationships with phase lagged curves. The phase timing of these plots matched well with average time series plots from the same zones, but more work is needed on the representation of amplitude","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/8974<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2011-01-18T15:16:34Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_262<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_264<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nTemplate phenology for vegetation models<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nBradley, A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nGerard, F.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBarbier, N.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWeedon, G.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nHuntingford, C.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nZelazowski, P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nAnderson, L.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nde Aragao, L.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKaduk, J\u00f6rg<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2009 IEEE International, IGARSS 2009, pp. IV-1042-IV-1045.
