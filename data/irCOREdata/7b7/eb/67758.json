K. Biswas, D. C. V. Mallik and C. V. Vishveshwara,\nCambridge University Press, 2008, pp. xix + 249. Scope: review. Level: general reader.\nEvery age and generation has its own picture of the universe and of man\u2019s place within it.\nThis paperback re-issue of the famous review edited by Biswas et al. examines how the\nperspective has evolved over the centuries, up to the original date of publication in 1989.\nIt consists of 14 chapters by some of the foremost scientists and historians of science of\ntheir day, each tackling a separate theme.\nAs the editors point out in the Preface, \u201cThe contemplation of the heavens has been\none of the most enduring adventures of the human mind\u201d, inspiring awe and inspiration\nsince the earliest times and leading naturally to the growth of astronomy and cosmology.\nIn the beginning, their main function was to support religion but gradually, as time passed,\nscience took on an independent role and developed the world-picture that we have today.\nSome religions, notably mainstream Christianity, readity adapted and encompassed the\nnew knowledge.\nIn his Foreword, R. Hanbury Brown points out that astronomy has always played a\nmajor part in the development of science, quoting Tycho Brahe\u2019s remark that to compre-\nhend what we see in the sky we should look at our feet, while to comprehend what lies at\nour feet we should look in the sky. This is of course as true as it ever has been. There are\nchapters on astronomy in ancient China and India, and on the impact of astronomy on the\ndevelopment of Western science. Other chapters include reviews of the position and major\nquestions in astronomy and cosmology (as of 20 years ago), the origin and evolution of\nlife, and the anthropic principle. A full chapter is devoted to astrology, examining the ev-\nidence, and ruminating as to why it has somehow survived and still remains popular long\nafter science had shown its central premises to be fundamentally misguided and wrong.\nThere is also a chapter on the relationship between astronomy and science fiction. There\nare chapters by Hoyle and Narlikar on frontiers in astronomy, and on whether the universe\noriginated in a big bang, respectively. I expected they would just be period pieces, but\nthey are not. They are thoughtful, forward-looking, and imaginitive, written in a context\nmore that 20 years after the discovery of the cosmic background radiation.\nDespite the huge developments in cosmology over the last two decades, and the tor-\nrent of relevant data arriving from satellite observations, is is surprising how little the\nunderlying issues have changed. Cosmic Perspectives still seems almost as fresh and vital\nas it did when first published.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 51, 287 (2010).\n"}
