The influence of the solar proton event (SPE) 14\u2013\n16 July 2000 on Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSE)\nis examined. PMSE were observed by the Esrange VHF\nMST Radar (ESRAD) at 67\u25e653\u2032 N, 21\u25e606\u2032 E. The 30 MHz\nImaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies IRIS in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(69\u25e630\u2032 N, 20\u25e647\u2032 E) registered cosmic radio noise absorp-\ntion caused by ionisation changes in response to the energetic\nparticle precipitation. An energy deposition\/ion-chemical\nmodel was used to estimate the density of free electrons and\nions in the upper atmosphere. Particle collision frequencies\nwere calculated from the MSISE-90 model. Electric fields\nwere calculated using conductivities from the model and\nmeasured magnetic disturbances. The electric field reached\na maximum of 91 mV\/m during the most intensive period of\nthe geomagnetic storm accompanying the SPE. The temper-\nature increase due to Joule and particle heating was calcu-\nlated, taking into account radiative cooling. The temperature\nincrease at PMSE heights was found to be very small.\nThe observed PMSE were rather intensive and extended\nover the 80\u201390 km height interval. PMSE almost disappeared\nabove 86 km at the time of greatest Joule heating on 15 July\n2000. Neither ionisation changes, nor Joule\/particle heating\ncan explain the PMSE reduction. Transport effects due to the\nstrong electric field are a more likely explanation.\nKey words. Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (mid-\ndle atmospheric dynamics), ionosphere (ionospheric distur-\nbances; solar radiation and cosmic ray effects)\n1 Introduction\nSolar proton events (SPE) are characterized by intensive\nparticle precipitation, mostly protons of energies from 10\u2013\n300 MeV (Brasseur and Solomon, 1986). These events may\nincrease ionisation in the upper mesosphere to high levels\nand are often also associated with magnetospheric distur-\nCorrespondence to: V. Barabash\n(victoria@irf.se)\nbances leading to Joule heating of the neutral upper atmo-\nsphere in the polar regions (Roble et al., 1987). The ion-\nisation gives rise to chemical reactions and changes in the\ndensities of active atmospheric constituents. Amongst other\neffects, this causes a depletion of ozone in the middle atmo-\nsphere, thus reducing the radiative heating rate in the upper\nstratosphere and mesosphere (Johnson and Luhmann, 1993).\nThe SPE, which occurred on 14\u201316 July 2000, was the\nthird largest solar event in the past 30 years (Jackman et al.,\n2001). It causes increased production of HOx (H, HO, HO2)\nand NOx (N, NO, NO2) in the mesosphere and the upper\nstratosphere. Measurements from the UARS HALOE and\nNOAA 14 SBUV\/2 instruments indicated a short-term (day)\nmiddle mesospheric ozone depletion of 70% caused by HOx\nand a long-term (several days) upper stratospheric ozone de-\npletion of 9% caused by NOx (Jackman et al., 2001). The\nresults of Reagan et al. (1981) suggested that, although the\nmesospheric ozone depletion lasts a relatively short period,\nit produces a long-term decrease in the neutral heating rate\nthat causes a reduction of mesospheric temperatures during\nseveral days after the event. The Joule heating, on the other\nhand, produces a sudden increase in the neutral heating rate\nin the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (Reagan et\nal., 1981; Roble et al., 1987). The latter observations have\nbeen found to be consistent with model predictions by John-\nson (1987), who also emphasized the possibility of enhanced\ndiurnal tidal amplitudes when a Joule heat source is added\nin the 80\u2013120 km altitude range. That the latter can indeed\noccur has been confirmed by observations made by the Poker\nFlat, Alaska, and MST radar during SPEs in 1982 and 1984\n(Johnson and Luhmann, 1993). Thus, the SPE represents a\ndramatic change in ionospheric and atmospheric conditions\nin the D- and E-regions, and, therefore, might have an im-\npact on the middle atmosphere and subsequently Polar Meso-\nspheric Summer Echoes (PMSE) (Ro\u00a8ttger, 1997).\nPMSE are strong, coherent radar echoes registered by\nVHF radars at 80\u201390 km altitude in the summer months at\nhigh latitudes (Ecklund and Balsley, 1981; Ro\u00a8ttger et al.,\n1988) and mid-latitudes (Czechowsky et al., 1979, Reid et\n760 V.

A pre-\ncondition for the echoes is the presence of structures in the\nelectron density on the scale of the radar half wavelength. It\nis generally considered that this can occur only if charged\naerosols are present. Overviews of PMSE are given by Cho\nand Kelly (1993) and Cho and Ro\u00a8ttger (1997).\nThere are rather few studies concerning the possible ef-\nfects of SPE on PMSE, or on the closely related polar meso-\nspheric clouds (PMC) and noctilucent clouds (NLC). Von\nZahn (2001) pointed out that on 14 July, the ALOMAR li-\ndar located in Northern Norway (69\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6 E) observed an\naerosol layer above 85 km, that is likely to be noctilucent\nclouds (NLC). Rapp et al. (2002) investigated the depen-\ndence of PMSE on the modelled background electron num-\nber density in the presence of the SPE on 14\u201316 July 2000.\nA significant, negative correlation between SNR (signalto-\nnoise-ratio) and the electron number density for densities\non the order of 105 cm\u22123 was found. Rapp et al. (2002)\nexplained the anticorrelation as due to a limited amount of\naerosol particles.\nThis study presents PMSE measurements made by the 52\nMHz MST radar (ESRAD) located at Esrange (67\u25e653\u2032 N,\n21\u25e606\u2032 E) in Northern Sweden during the SPE on 14\u201316 July\n2000. Because of the long duration of the SPE (several days)\nit is possible to model the electron and ion number densities\nduring day and night conditions, using the observed proton\nfluxes and, to combine this with an empirical model for elec-\ntron density due to solar illumination. The high densities of\nelectrons and ions achieved during the SPE allow us to test\nwhether PMSE strength is related to the density of free elec-\ntrons or to something else. The temperature changes in the\nlower thermosphere due to Joule and particle heating have\nbeen calculated.\n2 Proton fluxes, energetic particle precipitation, elec-\ntron and ion number densities\nThe solar protons were measured by the NOAA GOES-\n10 (http:\/\/sec.noaa.gov\/ftpmenu\/lists\/particle.html) and ACE\n(http:\/\/sec.noaa.gov\/ace\/) satellites, for energies above and\nbelow 5 MeV, respectively. The proton fluxes for <5 MeV\nand >5 MeV are shown in the top panel of Fig. 1. The sharp\nincrease of the high-energy proton fluxes intensities starts at\nabout 10:45 UT on 14 July. It remains rather stable during\n14 and 15 July, gains its maximum at 12:30 UT on 15 July\n(NOAA Space Environment Services Centre) and begins to\ndecrease first abruptly and then more slowly, after 20:00 UT\non 15 July.\nTwo separate exponentials (one below 5 MeV and one\nabove 5 MeV) have been found to give the best fit to the\njoint differential flux measurements from ACE and GOES\nsatellites. It should be pointed out that, in most solar proton\nevents, low energy protons, i.e. below 5 MeV, never reach the\nV.

However, lower-energy protons, as low as 0.1 MeV,\ncan be expected to reach the atmosphere at our site during\nthe major storm which immediately followed the period of\nmost intense proton fluxes, starting at about 20:00 UT on 15\nJuly. We have used the results of Smart et al. (1999a, b, c)\nto calculate the proton cutoff energy as a function of the Dst\nindex (the latter from the World Data Centre for Geomag-\nnetism, Kyoto, Japan). We have fitted an analytical form,\nEcut = 10.\u02c6(0.7997 + 0.0053\u2217Dst) (1)\nto the tables and figures in these papers. The predicted cutoff\nenergy (Ecut) during the SPE, calculated using the Dst index,\nis shown in Fig. 1. The resultant electron and ion densities\nare shown in the colour panels in Fig. 1. The main part of the\nSPE produces ionisation below 80 km, with the peak electron\ndensities around 70 km altitude.\nThe obtained spectrum has been used as an input to the\nenergy deposition\/ion-chemical model to estimate the den-\nsity of free electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere (Kirk-\nwood and Osepian, 1995). The ion chemistry calculations in-\nclude molecular ions (NO+, O+2 ), positive cluster ions (clus-\nters of NO+ and O+2 with O2, N2, CO2, H2O and proton hy-\ndrates) and negative ions (O\u22122 and heavy negative ions CO\u22123\nand NO\u22123 ).\nThe electron number density due to solar ionization has\nbeen taken from a statistical study of electron densities due to\nsolar radiation in the E-region, i.e. above 90 km (Kirkwood,\n1993) (Fig. 2). The diurnal variations in the negative ion and\nelectron number densities are due to the fact that the neg-\native ions are more persistent during the night, as well as\nthe increased attachment of electrons to form negative ions.\nDuring the daytime, the electrons are readily removed from\nthe negative ions by sunlight and by reactions with atomic\noxygen. The daily variation of the positive cluster ions is\ndue to the reduction in recombination at night as the num-\nber of free electrons is diminished. The calculations show\nhigher electron densities above ca. 80 km for ca. 36 h, starting\nfrom 20:00 UT on 15 July when the Dst index drops sharply\nand remains at values of \u2212300 to \u2212100. In these conditions,\nlower energy protons are expected to reach the atmosphere.\nThe lowest panel of Fig. 1 shows the observed absorption\nof cosmic radio noise at 30 MHz measured by the Imag-\ning Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(69\u25e630\u2032 N, 20\u25e647\u2032 E). The riometer absorption level reaches\nas high as 18 dB during the SPE. Comparison between the\nmeasured absorption and the modelled values indicates that\nthe model represents the situation in the atmosphere reason-\nably well, although there is some discrepancy in the early\npart of the event. This is likely due to the extremely high\nproton energies present at the start of the event, which pro-\nduce ionisation below 50 km altitude, beyond the limit of our\nmodel.\n3 Characteristics of PMSE\nThe MST radar ESRAD (67\u25e653\u2032 N, 21\u25e606\u2032 E) operates at\n52 MHz with 72 kW peak power and a maximum duty cycle\nof 5%. The antenna consists of a 12\u00d712 array of 5-element\n762 V.

For the altitude range of 80\u201390 km data were col-\nlected using a 16-bit complementary code with a 150 m range\nresolution. The sampling frequency was set to 1450 Hz. For\nthe altitude range of 4.8\u201399.6 km a 8-bit complementary code\nwith a 600-m range resolution was used. The sampling fre-\nquency for that mode was set to 1300 Hz.\nEchoes have been judged to be present if the SNR (signal-\nto-noise ratio) exceeded \u221210 dB. However, to allow us to\neliminate the effects of background (cosmic) noise varia-\ntions, we generally use the radar signal power instead of\nSNR. For altitudes of 80\u201390 km the signal power has been\nmedian filtered with a time resolution of 15 min. To take into\naccount absorption of the radar signal by ionisation produced\nby the energetic particles in the atmosphere below 80 km dur-\ning the solar proton event, the signal power \u03c3 has been cor-\nrected according to:\n\u03c3 = sradar + 2A, (2)\nwhere sradar is the MST radar observed backscatter signal\npower, dB, A is the height integrated absorption of the radar\nsignal at 52 MHz between 64\u201380 km, dB.\nHeight integrated absorption of the radar signal at 52 MHz\nhas been estimated using the modeled electron number densi-\nties (Kirkwood and Osepian, 1995) and the classical equation\n(Hargreaves, 1992):\nA = 4.5 \u00b7 10\u22125\n\u222b\nNe \u00b7 \u03bden\n\u03c92 + \u03bd2en\ndx (3)\nNe =\n(\nN2e (protons)+N2e (sun)\n) 1\n2\n, (4)\nwhere Ne is the total electron number density, m\u22123,\nNe (protons) is the modelled electron number density due to\nthe solar proton event, m\u22123,\nNe (Sun) is the electron number density due to the sunlight,\nm\u22123 (Kirkwood, 1993),\n\u03bden is the electron-neutral collision frequency, s\u22121,\n\u03c9 is the angular wave frequency, s\u22121.\nHeight integrated absorption of the radar signal at 52 MHz\nbetween 80\u201399.5 km is very small and not taken into con-\nsideration (Fig. 3). Since the transmitted radar signal is ab-\nsorbed twice, the height-integrated absorption is multiplied\nby a factor of 2 in Eq. (2). Faraday rotation effects calculated\naccording to Kirkwood and Ro\u00a8ttger (1995) are found to be\nnegligible in the entire height range.\nAs it can be seen, PMSE is rather intensive and extends\nover the whole height interval between 80 and 90 km, i.e. the\nlimits where they have been mainly observed (Fig. 3). Com-\nparison of the radar signal height profiles with the total elec-\ntron number density demonstrates their strong altitude de-\npendence (Fig. 4) and reveals a decrease in the radar signal\nabove 86 km during the strong ionospheric disturbances on\n15 July. More exact comparison of this decrease in PMSE on\n15 July with the ionospheric disturbance is the main aim of\nthis paper. However, since fluctuations of the radar signal at\nthose heights are quite common, they are not necessarily con-\nnected to the SPE. Above 90 km the electron number density\nis mainly determined by the ionization from the Sun and is\nmodified only slightly by the SPE.\nV.

The magnetosphere electric field of large\nscale (100 km) can penetrate well below the ionosphere and\nall the way down to 20\u201340 km (Brekke, 1997) and remains\nconstant over the considered altitude range (Kelley, 1989).\nThis mapping of the electric field is expected theoretically,\ndue to high conductivity along the magnetic field lines.

Daily net Joule heating rates.\nAs is seen (Fig. 6), the largest electric field up to 91 mV\/m\nis calculated to have appeared during the most intense geo-\nmagnetic disturbance, as indicated by both the local magne-\ntometer data and the general Ap index.\nOur assumption of an infinitely broad current sheet can\nlead to an underestimate of the ionospheric current and the\nassociated electric field. On the other hand, our neglect of\ninduced currents below the Earth\u2019s surface will lead to an\noverestimate. The relationship between ionospheric currents\nand magnetic disturbances at the Earth\u2019s surface in the auro-\nral zone has been discussed in detail by Araki et al. (1989).\nFor a current sheet with a north-south width of 800 km, and\na variation of 10 s, they found on theoretical grounds that the\ninfinite-current sheet assumption would lead to a 15% under-\nestimate of the current, while neglecting the induced currents\nwould lead to a 20% overestimate. Summarizing published\nobservations of both ionospheric currents and ground mag-\nnetic disturbances in the auroral zone, they found that appli-\ncation of Eq. (8) could lead to between 60% underestimates\nand 20% overestimates of the ionospheric currents, on differ-\nent occasions.\nAdditionally, the electric field might be overestimated due\nto the uncertainties in determining the Hall conductivity,\nwhich depends primarily on the accuracy of the electron den-\nsity calculations. Since auroral precipitation (i.e. electrons\nwith keV energies from within the magnetosphere), due to\na lack of relevant data could not be taken into consideration\nin the energy deposition\/ion-chemical model, we should re-\nmember that the Hall conductivity might be underestimated\nparticularly close to magnetic midnight (21:30 UT), when\naurora are common.\n766 V.

Daily net particle heating rates.\n5 Joule and particle heating\nThe electric field is a potential heat source for ionospheric\nparticles (Rees, 1989). It is due to the fact that, under the\naction of the electric field, charged particles drift relative to\none another and to neutral particles. Collisions between the\nparticles limit their drift and convert part of the drift energy\ninto the thermal energy. Since this Joule heating is due to\nthe Pedersen current (Rees et al., 1983), the equation for the\nheating P will be:\nP = \u03c3p \u00b7 E2x . (12)\nThe local Joule heating rate is shown in Fig. 7. It gains max-\nimum values at about 73 km and above 90 km. The high-\nest heating rate corresponds to the highest electric field on\n15 July. However, even then the rate becomes competitive\nand dominates the solar heating rate of 3 K\/day in the sunlit\nmesopause (Roble et al., 1987) only above 90 km.\nTo calculate the particle heating rate the ionization rate\nfrom the energy deposition\/ion-chemical model has been\nused (Kirkwood and Osepian, 1995) (Fig. 8). The particle\nheating rate is proportional to the ionization rate and, so fol-\nlows the same altitude profile. This heating rate has a ten-\ndency to be the highest during the most intense geomagnetic\ndisturbance 15 July. Note that our neglect of possible auroral\nprecipitation means the Joule heating may be overestimated.\n6 Radiative heating and cooling\nThe middle atmospheric cooling due to thermal radiation is\nmainly affected by the ro-vibrational bands of CO2 around\n15\u00b5m, by the 9.6\u00b5m O3 ro-vibrational band and by the in-\nfrared (IR) H2O bands (dominated by the rotational band).\nThe radiative transfer in the 15\u00b5m CO2 band provides\nthe major contribution to the radiative cooling throughout\nthe middle atmosphere. This is essentially the only radiative\n\u221240 \u221235 \u221230 \u221225 \u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\n140\n150\n14\u221216 July 2000\nkm\n                           K\/day\n14 July\u2212blue, 15 July\u2212red, 16 July\u2212green\nFig. 9. Radiative cooling\/heating rates of CO2.\nmechanism of cooling in the upper mesosphere and lower\nthermosphere. The radiative cooling in the 9.6\u00b5m O3 band\nis next in importance. Its effect is about 25% of the total\ncooling in and around the stratopause and decreases with al-\ntitude. The H2O bands play a tertiary role, contributing about\n5\u20137% of the total IR cooling of the middle atmosphere.\nIn this study we confined our estimations of radiative cool-\ning to that by the CO2 molecules (Fig. 9). In the altitude\nregion above about 85 km the CO2 cooling is significantly\naffected by the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-\nLTE). The ALI-ARMS (Kutepov et al., 1998; Gusev et al.,\n2002) code package was used for calculation of this cooling.\nThe model of non-LTE in CO2 corresponds to that described\nby Shved et al. (1998). We accounted for 113 vibrational lev-\nels of 5 CO2 isotopic species (626, 636, 628, 627, and 638)\nand considered line-by-line radiative transfer in about 300\nro-vibrational bands (with total number of lines exceeding\n30 000) including those in the 1\u20135\u00b5m near-infrared spectral\nregion. Therefore, the obtained cooling rates also account for\nheating effects due to the absorption of the near-infrared so-\nlar radiation. The spectroscopic data for all bands considered\nwere taken from the spectral database HITRAN2000.\nThe atmospheric pressure and temperature distributions in\nthe altitude region of 50\u2013150 km as well as the volume mix-\ning ratios for all atmospheric components except for CO2\nwere taken from MSISE-90 model for the corresponding\ndays and times. For the CO2 volume mixing ratio (vmr) we\nused the newest data presented by Kaufmann et al. (2002).\nThese data were retrieved from the CO2 limb radiances ob-\ntained in the CRISTA 1 and 2 satellite experiments (Offer-\nmann et al., 1999; Grossmann et al., 2002) and are signif-\nicantly lower (up to 50%) above the altitude of 70 km than\nthose based on earlier rocket data (see Kaufmann et al., 2002\nfor the discussion). It is worth noticing here that the CO2\ncooling rate at about 80 km is roughly proportional to the\nCO2 vmr. Therefore, the cooling calculated in this study\nV. Barabash et al.: Polar mesosphere summer echoes 767\nfor the CRISTA CO2 vmr is up to 50% lower than that for\nthe vmr based on the rocket measurements (Offermann and\nGrossmann, 1973; Philbrick et al., 1973; Trinks et al., 1978;\nOffermann et al.; 1981).\nThe CO2 non-LTE cooling in the mesosphere and lower\nthermosphere is strongly affected by the quenching rate of\nthe \u03bd2 vibrations of the CO2 molecules by collisions with\nthe O (3P) atoms. This rate is defined by the product of\nthe rate coefficient for the reaction CO2 (\u03bd2)+O (3P)\u2192CO2\n(\u03bd2\u22121)+O (3P) and the O (3P) density. We used in our cal-\nculations the O (3P) density from MSISE-90 model and the\nrate coefficient of 3\u00b710\u221212 cm3\u00b7s\u22121. The latter is median be-\ntween the laboratory value of 1.5\u00b710\u221212 cm3\u00b7s\u22121 of Shved\net al. (1991) and the value of about 6\u00b710\u221212 cm3\u00b7s\u22121, which\nwas derived by Sharma and Wintersteiner (1990) from the\nanalysis of the IR Earth\u2019s limb radiance observations. Again,\nas in the case with the CO2 vmr, the CO2 non-LTE cooling is\nroughly proportional to the rate constant. Therefore, it will\nbe approximately a factor two lower or higher (for the same\nO (3P) density) when lower or higher rate coefficient values,\nrespectively, are used.\nThe total heating in the upper atmosphere is also affected\nby the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by ozone in the\nHuggins and Hartley bands and by molecular oxygen in the\nSchumann-Runge continuum (Brasseur and Solomon, 1986).\nThe mean heating rate determined by those components may\nvary significantly with latitude and season. For the summer\nconditions at the latitude of 67\u25e6 N the rates can be estimated\nas a continuous increase from 8 K\/day at about 80 km up to\n30 K\/day above 95 km.\n7 Temperature\nIn order to test whether Joule and particle heating can have\ninfluenced the PMSE we have estimated the temperature\nchange due to these sources using the conductivities and\nelectric fields shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The time constant\nfor radiative relaxation has been estimated for each altitude\nbetween 60 and 15 km as a linear coefficient between the\ncooling\/heating rate due to carbon dioxide and the maxi-\nmum (minimum) temperatures in the model runs described in\nthe previous section (Newtonian cooling approximation, e.g.\nBrasseur and Solomon, 1986) (Fig. 10). Radiative cooling\nof this type is assumed to be the dominant process counter-\nacting the effects of the Joule and particle heating. The tem-\nperature enhancement during the SPE has been calculated by\nincluding the Newtonian cooling, Joule and particle heating\nrates (Fig. 11). The temperature started to increase in the\nlower thermosphere on 14 July. Then, during the most in-\ntense period of the ionospheric disturbances on 15 July, the\ntemperature continued to increase in the thermosphere and\nslightly in the mesosphere. Since radiative relaxation times\nare of the order of several days (Fig. 10) those temperature\nchanges are expected to be rather stable and last several days\nafter the event.\n\u221260 \u221240 \u221220 0 20 40 60\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n130\nkm\nTime (days)\nFig. 10. Radiative relaxation time corresponding to cooling\/heating\nrates of CO2 between 50\u2013150 km altitude for 14\u201316 July 2000.\n8 Discussion\nDuring the SPE 14\u201316 July 2002 an enhanced energy flux\nhas been transferred from the solar wind to the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere, thus, initiating a strong geomagnetic storm. The\nstorm intensity can be illustrated by the Ap indices, which\nshowed two maxima of 154 and 400 at 18:00 UT 14 July, and\nat 21:00 UT 15 July, respectively. That effect has also been\nconfirmed by the magnetometer data from Kiruna, which\ndemonstrated a significant deflection of the northward com-\nponent of the magnetic field at the same time (Fig. 6). The\ngeomagnetic storm enhances the ring current (see Dst index\nFig. 1) and moves the magnetopause inward thus, reduc-\ning the proton cut-off rigidity (Hargreaves, 1992; Smart et\nal. 1999a, 1999b, 1999c) and allowing the lower-energy pro-\ntons, as low as 0.1 MeV, to penetrate the atmosphere at the\nlatitude of our site (magnetic latitude 65\u25e6 N). Moreover, to-\nwards the end of the storm it is likely that concentration of the\nauroral electrons will increase, particularly above 100 km.\nThose electrons will increase the ionisation rate primarily\nin the auroral altitude interval (Roble et al., 1987) but not\nin the PMSE region. The ionisation rate due to solar protons\nmaximized during the geomagnetic storm 15 July with a pro-\nnounced peak at 75\u2013105 km. When such enhanced ionization\nrate coincides with large electric fields increased Joule heat-\ning rates can be expected to occur.\nJoule or frictional heating is produced by the electric field\nand its rate is equal to the total rate of mechanical energy in-\nput to the neutrals and the ions due to the collisions. Since\nthe Joule heating rate is proportional to the height depen-\ndent Pedersen conductivity, the rate is equivalent to the alti-\ntude profile of that conductivity except for the factor of the\nsquared electric field. Precipitated energetic protons greatly\nincreased the Pedersen conductivity in the polar cap meso-\nsphere.\n768 V.

Temperature enhancement between 70\u2013110 km altitude due to Joule and particle heating.\nTemperature changes calculated for the 70\u2013110 km alti-\ntude range on the base of Joule and particle heating rates\nfollow essentially the same time variability as the electric\n(and magnetic) fields, i.e. the temperature starts to increase\nwhen the fields start to deflect. Moreover, the values of the\ntemperature change are very height dependent. A significant\nincrease in the temperature on 15 July above 100 km is corre-\nlated in time with the decrease in the radar echo strength be-\ntween 80\u201390 km. However, the temperature change caused\nby Joule\/particle heating at the height of the radar echoes is\nextremely small and does not exceed 0.1 K. A previous study\nof the relation between mean daily temperature and mean\ndaily occurrence of PMSE (Kirkwood et al., 2002) showed\nthat some 10 s of K increase are needed to remove PMSE\nin normal summer conditions where it is well established, as\nhere. The prevailing temperatures in these conditions lie well\nbelow those needed for saturation, at least during most of the\nday, due to the action of tides and gravity waves. Since the\nexpected temperature increase is extremely small between\n80\u201390 km, orders of magnitude less than tidal and wave per-\nturbations, the PMSE disappearance cannot be explained by\nthe temperature change due to Joule heating.\nAnother factor that can influence the PMSE appearance\nis the particle motion in the ionosphere. The ion and\nparticle motion in the high-latitude ionosphere is governed\nby electric fields, neutral winds, gravity and ambipolar\ndiffusion (Kirkwood and von Zahn, 1991; Kirkwood and\nNilsson, 2000). Assuming steady-state ion drift, plasma\npressure gradients in the vertical direction and considering a\nsingle ion species, singly charged, the vertical component of\nthe ion drift vector \u03bdiz (positive upwards) is:\n\u03bdiz= \u03c9\n2\ni\n\u03c92i + \u03bd2i\n(\nEE\nB0\n\u2212 (+)WN sin I\n)\ncos I (13a)\n+ \u03c9\u03bdi\n\u03c92i + \u03bd2i\n(\n(\u2212)EN\nB0\n+WE\n)\ncos I (13b)\n+\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\ni\n\u03c92i + \u03bd2i\ncos2 I\n)\nWz (13c)\n\u2212 \u03c9e\u03c9i\n\u03c9e\u03bdi + \u03c9i\u03bde\n(\n1\nni\nd(nikT )\ndz\n+mg\n)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 2\nqB0\n(\nsin2 I + \u03bde\u03bdi cos\n2 I\n\u03bde\u03bdi + \u03c9e\u03c9i\n)\n, (13d)\n\u03c9i , \u03bdi are the ion gyro and collision frequencies,\n\u03c9i , \u03bde are the electron gyro and collision frequencies,\nEE , EN are the northward and eastward components of the\nelectric field perpendicular to the magnetic field B0 directed\ndownward (Northern Hemisphere),\nI is the inclination of the magnetic field B0,\nWE , WN , WZ are the horizontal (northward and eastward)\nand vertical (positive upwards) components of the neutral\nwind,\nV.

(13a) is reversed, likewise\nthe electric field term in Eq. (13b). The first term (13a) dom-\ninates above 120\u2013130 km, i.e. at heights where the ion gyro\nfrequency exceeds the collision frequency and vertical mo-\ntion is due to the motion along the magnetic field line follow-\ning the component of the meridional wind in that direction,\nplus E\u00d7B drift due to east-west components of the electric\nfield. The term (13b) dominates below 100\u2013110 km, i.e. at\nheights where the ion collision frequency exceeds the gyro-\nfrequency. Here, the vertical motion is due to motion in the\nW\u00d7B direction resulting from the zonal wind, plus drift in\nthe direction of the north-south component of the electric\nfield. (Kirkwood and Nilsson, 2000). It should also be men-\ntioned that a strong wind of 100 m\/s has the same effect as\nan electric field of 5 mV\/m. Thus, when the electric field is\nmaximized, as in our case, the effect of neutral wind might\nbe negligible. The term (13c) represents ion motion carried\nby the vertical component of the neutral wind, which may\nbe significant at any height in the presence of strong vertical\nmotion, for example, in atmospheric gravity waves. The term\n(13d) represents ion diffusion due to gradients in the plasma\npressure and to the force of gravity (Kirkwood and Nilsson,\n2000).\nThe Joule heating of neutrals can lead to upward neutral\nwind in a region of high electron densities and strong elec-\ntric fields (Winser et al., 1986). As discussed by Kirkwood\nand von Zahn (1991), aerosol mobility at the relevant heights\nmay be of the same order of magnitude as that for ions, espe-\ncially if they are multiply charged. Extensive studies of ion\nand aerosol mobilities have been reported by Mason and Mc-\nDaniel (1988), and Tammet (1995). At a height of 100 km a\n40 mV\/m electric field gives a drift velocity of 17 m\/s for par-\nticles with radii of 0.65 nm, and 4 m\/s for particles with radii\nof 1.3 nm (Kirkwood and von Zahn, 1991). So vertical trans-\nport by the action of the electric field or wind on the aerosols\nor water cluster ions might be expected (Kirkwood and Nils-\nson, 2000). Those processes could result in a lack of charged\naerosols to support the balance between the electron density\ninhomogeneity generation and diffusion necessary for VHF\nradar scatter to take place (Cho and Ro\u00a8ttger, 1997). If so, the\ndecrease in the radar echoes above 86 km on 15 July, when\nthe electric field gains its maximum, might be connected to\nsuch transport.\nWe note that the first reduction of PMSE between\n12:00 UT and 17:00 UT coincides with strong northward\nelectric fields. This would drive positive ions\/aerosols up-\nward and negative aerosols downward. Removal of positive\nwater-cluster ions from the top of the PMSE layer and nega-\ntive aerosols from the bottom could account for the observed\nbehaviour of the PMSE layer (where only a thin layer at 84\u2013\n86 km remains). Aerosols moved to lower altitudes would\nevaporate, whereas cluster ions moved to higher altitudes\nwould dissociate. The PMSE layer recovers briefly at 80\u2013\n84 km at the time when the electric field changes abruptly to\nsouthward, which could be due to the redistributing of the\nplasma components by the electric field, or to wave activ-\nity, which is common in PMSE. The second, almost 100%\nreduction in PMSE at all heights, between 19:00 UT and\n24:00 UT, coincides with the time of the strong southward\nelectric field. Such a field would drive negative aerosols up-\nward and positive ions downward, again removing them from\na height where they could survive, or contribute to PMSE,\nrespectively. It should, however, be remembered that, even\nin normal conditions PMSE are often weak at this time of\nthe day (Czechowsky et al., 1989; Kirkwood et al., 1995;\nBarabash et al., 1998). So it may be easier to remove them\nentirely with a small transport effect of the electric field.\n9 Conclusion\nThe PMSE observed by ESRAD during the solar proton\nevent on 14\u201316 July 2000 reveal a substantial decrease in the\nradar echoes above 86 km at the time of the greatest iono-\nspheric disturbances on 15 July. The results of numerical\nsimulations demonstrated an increase in electrons and ions\nnumber densities throughout the event. The electric field\ncalculated on the basis of magnetometer measurements and\nmodelled conductivities gains its maximum of 91 mV\/m dur-\ning the most intensive period of geomagnetic disturbances.\nThe electric field is expected to produce upward\/downward\ntransport of ions and aerosols, thus, possibly decreasing the\namount of charged aerosols in the vicinity of PMSE. The\nJoule heating generated by the geomagnetic storm might be\nresponsible for the ion redistribution as well, through the\ngeneration of vertical winds. The temperature change due to\nJoule and particle heating at the PMSE height is far too little\nto lead to the destruction of the ice particles and PMSE dis-\nappearance, compared to the ever-present wave fluctuations.\nSince the temperature increase is extremely small between\n80\u201390 km altitude, it is rather the transport effects due to the\nintensified electric field at the most disturbed time, which can\nbe responsible for the reduction of PMSE above 86 km.\nAcknowledgements.
