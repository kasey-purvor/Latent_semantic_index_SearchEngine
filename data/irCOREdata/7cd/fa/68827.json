INTRODUCTION\nA. Rationale\nThe acoustic characteristics of vowels produced by\nEnglish-learning infants have been described in a number of\nprior studies \u0001Buhr, 1980; Gilbert et al., 1997; Kent and Mur-\nray, 1982; Robb et al., 1997; Rvachew et al. 1996; Sussman\net al. 1999; 1996\u0002. These studies have revealed a strong pref-\nerence for central vowels, with very little developmental\nchange in the location of the center of the vowel space, and\na very gradual expansion of the range of vowels produced\nwith age. These characteristics of infant vowels are inter-\npreted as reflecting the limitations imposed by the structure\nof the infant\u2019s vocal tract and immature speech motor con-\ntrol. The process by which the young child overcomes these\nphysiological limitations to acquire the vowel system of the\nambient language is not well understood however. The pur-\npose of this study was to shed some light on this develop-\nmental process by shifting the focus from the universal char-\nacteristics of the infant vowel space to individual differences\nin infant vowel production. Specifically, we describe the\nvowels produced by a relatively large number of infants\ndrawn from a broad age range and two language back-\ngrounds.\nB. Background\n1. Acoustic characteristics of infant vowels\nKent and Murray \u00011982\u0002 measured the formant frequen-\ncies of vocalic utterances produced by 21 English-learning\ninfants aged 3, 6, and 9 months. Mean first formant \u0001F1\u0002 and\nsecond formant \u0001F2\u0002 values remained relatively stable across\nthe three age groups of infants, \u0001approximately\n900\u20131000 Hz for F1 and 3000 Hz for F2\u0002. However, the\nrange of first and second formant frequencies progressively\nincreased with age, indicating an expansion of the vowel\nspace. A preference for midfront or central vowels was ob-\nserved throughout the 3-to 9-month age range. Buhr \u00011980\u0002\nreported similar findings for a single infant who demon-\nstrated a gradual growth of the vowel space along the\nF1\u2013F2 dimensions between 16 and 64 weeks of age. Re-\nshaping of the vowel space was also observed with the acute\nregion becoming more defined at an earlier age than the\ngrave corner of the vowel space.\nRvachew et al. \u00011996\u0002 described the vowels produced by\nnine infants, followed longitudinally from 6 to 18 months of\nage. The mean and standard deviation of first formant fre-\nquencies were stable throughout this period. A large and\nsteady increase in the range of F2 values was observed dur-\ning the period of the study. The mean F1 observed by\nRvachew et al. \u00011996\u0002 was similar to that reported by Kent\nand Murray \u00011982\u0002 for younger infants but the mean F2 was\nconsiderably lower at approximately 2400 Hz. A small re-\nduction of the mean F2 was observed during the latter half of\nthe observation period.\nRobb et al. \u00011997\u0002 described the vowels produced by 20\nchildren aged 4 to 25 months in a cross-sectional study.\nContrary to expectations, no decrease with age in mean F2\nor F1 was apparent. In a longitudinal study of four infants\nbetween the ages of 15 and 36 months, Gilbert et al. \u00011997\u0002\ndid find a significant lowering of F1 and F2, but only be-\ntween 24 and 36 months.\nJ.

Role of physiological limitations\nSeveral factors can explain the observed acoustic shifts\nin vowel production across the infancy period: anatomical\ngrowth, motor control development, auditory \u0001peripheral and\ncentral\u0002 abilities, and other cognitive factors. The structure of\nthe human vocal tract is obviously an important determinant\nof the acoustic characteristics of speech sounds. Studies us-\ning magnetic resonance imaging \u0001MRI\u0002 confirm the long-\nstanding impression that vocal tract development does not\ninvolve a simple linear increase in vocal tract length \u0001Fitch\nand Giedd, 1999\u0002. Major developmental changes in vocal\ntract structure that occur shortly after birth include the de-\nscent of the larynx, lengthening of the pharyngeal cavity, and\na sharper angle between the oral and pharyngeal cavities\n\u0001Kent and Vorperian 1995\u0002. Kent et al. \u00011999\u0002 described the\ngrowth of the supralaryngeal vocal tract in one infant who\nreceived repeated MRI scans between birth and 30 months of\nage. They found that changes in the size of vocal tract struc-\ntures were generally coordinated, even during growth spurts\nat 1 and 4 months of age and 12 and 15 months of age. Most\nof the increase in vocal tract length in the infants\u2019 first year\ncould be explained by the descent of the larynx and tongue,\nwhereas the lengthening of the hard palate made a greater\ncontribution to vocal tract growth during the second year of\nlife.\nThe influence of the morphology of the vocal tract on\nthe acoustic characteristics of infant vowels has been inves-\ntigated in studies in which the Variable Linear Articulatory\nModel was used to synthesize vowels that would be pro-\nduced by vocal tracts having the dimensions observed for\ndifferent age groups, specifically a 4-week-old infant, 2-, 4-,\n8-, and 12-years-old children, a 16-years-old adolescent, and\na 21-years-old adult male \u0001M\u00e9nard et al., 2002; 2004\u0002. Lis-\ntener judgments of the resulting vowels indicated that the\ninfant\u2019s vocal tract anatomy does not prevent the production\nof the full range of vowels used in the ambient language. At\nthe same time, infant vocal tract anatomy does at least partly\nexplain infant production preferences: When the maximal\nvowel space is plotted for the infant and adult vocal tracts, a\nlarger portion of the infant vowel space corresponds to vow-\nels that would be perceived to be low or front vowels, when\ncompared to the adult vowel space. It is also important to\nnote that while it is possible to produce vowels with an infant\nvocal tract that are perceptually equivalent to adult vowel\ncategories, in many cases the infant would need to employ\ndifferent articulatory gestures than the adult to achieve the\nsame perceptual outcome.\nThe finding that the full range of vowel contrasts can be\nproduced with the modeled infant vocal tract assumes adult-\nlike levels of motor control, which is obviously not the case\nin natural speech. Green et al. \u00012000\u0002 measured temporal and\nspatial coupling of upper lip, lower lip, and jaw movements,\nduring the production of \u0003baba\u0004, \u0003mama\u0004, and \u0003papa\u0004, in 1-,\n2-, and 6-year-old children and adults. Jaw movements were\ndominant, although poorly controlled with respect to force,\nin the 1-year-old children. By age 2, lip movements were\nmore integrated with the jaw movement. Between ages 2 and\n6 years, progressive differentiation of the rigid coupling of\nupper and lower lip movements was observed. The compari-\nson of movement patterns for 6-years-old children and adults\nindicated continual refinements in movement control and co-\nordination. Green et al. \u00012002\u0002 confirmed the developmental\npattern of increased integration of lip movement control into\na previously stabilized pattern of jaw movements between 1\nand 2 years of age. These data are consistent with the pre-\ndiction that the development of speech production involves\nan initial dominance of the \u201cmandibular frame\u201d followed by\na progressive differentiation of articulator movements. How-\never, the limitations imposed by immature speech motor con-\ntrol on the development of the infant\u2019s speech production\nabilities do not preclude a role for the auditory environment\nin shaping that nature of the infant\u2019s vocalizations.\n3. Role of the auditory environment\nAuditory input is clearly critical to the normal develop-\nment of speech, right from birth. The canonical babbling\nstage is delayed or never achieved by infants with sensory-\nneural hearing impairment \u0001see Oller, 2000 for a review of\nthis literature\u0002 because hearing impairment interferes with\nthe child\u2019s access to both self-produced and other-produced\nspeech \u0001Koopmans-van Beinum et al., 2001\u0002. The specific\nphonetic content of adult speech may shape infant speech\nproduction patterns. Kuhl and Meltzoff \u00011996\u0002 manipulated\nthe phonetic content of speech input to the infant in the labo-\nratory by presenting one of three point vowels to different\ngroups of infants aged 12, 16, or 20 weeks. Infants of all\nages shifted the acoustic characteristics of their vowels to-\nward the modeled vowel category.\nAnother strategy for examining the role of speech input\nis to study cross-linguistic variation in speech production. de\nBoysson-Bardies, et al. \u00011989\u0002 described the acoustic char-\nacteristics of the vowel space of 20 10-month-old infants\nbeing raised in monolingual French-, English-, Algerian-,\nand Cantonese-speaking families. They found support for the\ninfluence of the ambient language environment on the vowel\nformants, with variation in mean F1 and F2 frequencies be-\ning greater between language groups than within language\ngroups. English-learning infants\u2019 mean F2 values were\nslightly higher than French-learning infants\u2019 mean F2, but\nmean F1 values were similar for the English- and French-\nlearning infants. Their data suggest that there are systematic\nand language-specific differences in the articulatory move-\nments produced by infants from different language back-\ngrounds during the first year of life. However this study de-\nscribed only a single age group and a replication has not\nbeen published.\nThe purpose of the current study was to replicate these\nfindings with infant learners of Canadian English \u0001CE\u0002 or\nCanadian French \u0001CF\u0002. Recent studies of the adult vowel\nproductions of these languages indicate that CF and CE vow-\nels are characterized by significant acoustic-phonetic differ-\nences even where there is phonological overlap \u0001Escudero\nand Polka, 2003; LaCharite and Paradis, 1997; Martin,\n2002\u0002. Specifically, the CF \/i\/ is more diffuse relative to CE\n\/i\/, and the CF \/u\/ is more grave relative to CE \/u\/. The CF \/a\/\nis slightly less compact than CE \/a\/. The most acute vowel in\nCE is \u0003\u00e6\u0004, a vowel that is produced allophonically but not\nphonemically in CF. The acute corner of the CF vowel space\n2 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 120, No. 4, October 2006 Rvachew et al.: Developmental and cross-linguistic variation\n  PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \n  PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \n \n PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \nappears to be less acute in comparison with CE. These data\non vowels produced by adult speakers do not lead to specific\npredictions about the potential differences between the vowel\nspaces produced by infant learners of CE and CF because of\nthe differences in the procedures used to obtain and describe\nspeech samples produced by adult and infant talkers.\nNone the less, the fact that there are significant differences in\nthe acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the adult CE and CF\nvowel spaces supports the hypothesis that there may be\ncross-linguistic differences in the acoustic characteristics of\nvowels produced by infants who are exposed to one of these\nlanguages.\nC. The current studies\nThe purpose of experiment 1 was to systematically ex-\namine developmental changes and cross-linguistic differ-\nences in the first and second formant frequencies of vowels.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we recorded speech samples\nfrom 23 infants exposed to Canadian French and 20 infants\nexposed to Canadian English, aged between 10 and\n18 months. Acoustic analyses were used to describe the fre-\nquency locations of the center and the corners of each in-\nfant\u2019s vowel space. Although phonetic transcriptions facili-\ntate a direct comparison of infant and adult phonetic\nrepertoires, this type of analysis was avoided. Oller \u00012000\u0002\nhas questioned the validity of phonetic transcription for the\ndescription of infant speech on a number of grounds, three of\nwhich are particularly relevant to this investigation. First,\nphonetic transcriptions of infant vowels are notoriously un-\nreliable, especially for the identification of back vowels \u0001e.g.,\nDavis and MacNeilage 1995\u0002. Second, phonetic transcrip-\ntions are subject to listener biases that are particularly acute\nwhen listening to non-native speech sounds. Third, phonetic\ndescriptions of infant speech imply, unrealistically, that in-\nfant vocalizations are composed of the same articulatory fea-\ntures that characterize adult produced phonemes. As M\u00e9nard\net al. \u00012002, 2004\u0002 explained, listener perceptions of infant\nspeech do not reliably point to the underlying articulatory\ngestures that produced the perceived vowel. Thus, for this\nstudy we describe vowels in terms of raw acoustic param-\neters, specifically the mean and standard deviation of the F1\nand F2, and in terms of features that are simple linear com-\nbinations of the raw acoustic values, namely the acute-grave\nand compact-diffuse features. These features may be more\nclosely associated with the goals of vowel production than\nthe raw acoustic values, which vary significantly as a func-\ntion of vocal tract size and shape. Other researchers \u0001e.g.,\nKuhl et al., 1997\u0002 have used these parameters to describe\nvowel production.\nIn experiment 2, vowel spaces were modeled on the ba-\nsis of a simulation of the infant vocal tract at 6, 12, and\n18 months of age. The vowel space that would be produced\nby these vocal tracts was derived in order to aid in the inter-\npretation of the data obtained in experiment 1. This modeling\nstudy offered an opportunity to study the sole effect of vocal\ntract growth on acoustic data.\nOn the basis of the data reported by de Boysson-Bardies\net al. \u00011989\u0002, we expected cross-linguistic differences in the\ninfant\u2019s vowel productions. Specifically, a progressive diver-\ngence of the center of the vowel space for French and En-\nglish infants, particularly with respect to the F2 dimension,\nwas predicted. Changes in the first and second formant fre-\nquencies, for either language group, that are greater than\nwould be predicted from simple growth of the vocal tract \u0001as\nindicated by experiment 2\u0002 would lend further support to the\nhypothesis that the phonetic content of adult speech input has\nan influence on infant speech output during the first\n18 months of life. Language-general changes in the vowel\nspace were also expected, especially with respect to the over-\nall size of the vowel space.\nII. EXPERIMENT 1\nA. Method\n1. Participants\nForty-three typically developing infants from predomi-\nnately middle-class families were recruited from birth regis-\ntries for the Montr\u00e9al region. Each infant was no younger\nthan 300 days and no older than 570 days. All infants were\nreportedly born between 38 and 42 weeks gestation follow-\ning uncomplicated pregnancies, with no known history of ear\ninfections or hearing impairment, and were healthy on the\nday of testing. A parent questionnaire about language use in\nthe home \u0001e.g., by parent, siblings, television, radio\u0002, and in\nthe speech directed to their infant from others \u0001e.g., grand-\nparents, babysitter, daycare worker\u0002 confirmed that 23 infants\nwere being raised by monolingual CF speaking families, and\n20 infants were being raised by monolingual CE speaking\nfamilies. Thirty-two of the 43 infants passed several audio-\nlogical screenings \u0001tympanometry and otoacoustic emis-\nsions\u0002 performed by an audiologist beginning at 2\u20133 months\nof age \u0001these infants were initially recruited for another study\nin our lab\u0002. The remaining infants passed a tympanometric\nscreening on the day of the speech sample recording.\na. Speech sample recordings. Samples of the infants\u2019\nvocalizations were recorded during a play session between\nmother and infant, either in a sound proof booth in the labo-\nratory or in the infant\u2019s home. Mothers were instructed to\ninteract with their infant in the usual manner using a set of\nquiet toys. Recording sessions continued until the infant pro-\nduced 60 utterances perceived to meet the utterance selection\ncriteria \u0001described below\u0002, or until 30 minute had lapsed,\nwhichever came first. The speech samples were obtained us-\ning a portable DAT recorder and a Sennheiser microphone\naffixed to the infant\u2019s clothing at the shoulder. Following\nrecording, all speech utterances were digitized at 22 050 Hz\nusing Time Frequency Response software \u0001AVAAZ\u0002 installed\non IBM PC hardware equipped with a Creative Labs Live\nDrive.\nb. Acoustic analysis. Each utterance was assigned an\nInfraphonological code \u0001i.e., canonical syllable, fully reso-\nnant vowel, quasiresonant vowel, marginal syllable, squeal,\nraspberry or growl, using the criteria described in detail by\nOller, 1986\u0002. Isolated vowels and vowels contained within\ncanonical syllables were selected for formant analysis if\nvowel or syllable duration was less than 500 ms, and if the\nvowel had normal phonation, full resonance, and at least two\nJ.

These utterance types comprised 25%\nof the sample. The remaining utterances \u000128% marginal syl-\nlables, 47% \u201cother\u201d including quasiresonant vowels, squeals,\ngrowls, and raspberries\u0002 were not submitted to formant\nanalysis. Seven vowels were discarded from the data set be-\ncause either F1 \u0001n=2\u0002 or F2 \u0001n=5\u0002 was three standard de-\nviations greater than the mean value. A total of 1190 utter-\nances \u0001665 French, 525 English\u0002 met the criteria. Vowel\nformant analyses were performed blind to the age and lan-\nguage background of the infant. To determine F1 and F2\nfrequencies, a 20 ms segment at the middle of the steady\nstate portion was submitted to linear predictive coding \u0001LPC\u0002\nautocorrelation analysis with a window size of 256 points,\n50% overlap, 98% preemphasis, Hanning window, and\nmodel order of 12. Model order was increased or decreased\naccordingly to obtain reliable measurements of some vowels\nwhere the formants were difficult to measure. Formant loca-\ntions for all vowels were confirmed with narrowband short-\ntime FFT spectrograms \u0001512 points\u0002. The Peterson and Bar-\nney \u00011952\u0002 norms were also referred to in order to confirm\nthat the obtained frequency values roughly approximated the\nexpected relationship between formants, given the perceived\nquality of the vowel \u0001e.g., a vowel sounding to be \/u\/-like\nwould be expected to yield F1 and F2 values that were close\nin frequency\u0002. Replicate acoustic analysis of 299 vowels\n\u000125% of full sample\u0002 were conducted by a second individual\ntrained in speech acoustics who was blind to the age, lan-\nguage background of the infants, as well as the measure-\nments obtained by the first coder. Vowels were reanalyzed\nusing the same measurement parameters as the first coder\n\u0001see above\u0002. Intraclass correlations between the indepen-\ndently identified formant frequencies were 0.96 and 0.94 for\nF1 and F2 respectively.

Discussion\nAcoustic analyses of vowels produced by infants aged\napproximately 10 to 18 months indicated the presence of de-\nvelopmental changes that were common to both language\ngroups as well as some significant differences across lan-\nguage groups, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Cross-linguistic varia-\ntion was apparent in the frequency location of the center of\nthe infants\u2019 vowel spaces. Specifically, the French-learning\ninfants demonstrated a significant decline with age in the\nMF1, whereas the English-learning infants produced a sig-\nnificant decline with age in the MF2. The English-learning\ninfants demonstrated a significant increase in the dispersion\nof second formant frequencies as age increased. The French-\nlearning infants did not produce a reliable age-related change\nin SD F2 with age. Neither group showed age-related\nchanges in SD F1.\nBoth groups showed a developmental expansion of the\nsize of the vowel space along the diffuse-grave dimension\nalthough expansion into the diffuse corner was greater for\nthe French group and expansion into the grave corner was\ngreater for the English group. These findings suggest a de-\nvelopmental expansion into the areas of the vowel space tra-\nditionally associated with tongue retraction and advancement\nin adult articulation. Compression of the vowel space in the\nacute corner, particularly marked for the French group, sug-\ngests less extreme jaw opening gestures with age.\nThe distribution of the infants\u2019 vowels within this global\nvowel production space appears to differ across the language\ngroups. At the same time, English-learning and French-\nFIG. 2.

In order to interpret these devel-\nopmental changes in relation to the growth of the vocal tract\nduring this developmental period, a simulation experiment\nwas conducted.\nIII. EXPERIMENT 2\nA. Method\nThe maximal vowel spaces that could be produced by an\ninfant, aged 6-, 12-, or 18-months of age, were modeled\nusing the Variable Linear Articulatory Model \u0001VLAM\u0002. This\nmodel integrates the growth data currently available \u0001Gold-\nstein 1980\u0002 into a previous model already existing for the\nadult \u0001Maeda, 1979; 1990\u0002. The latter is based on a statistical\nanalysis of 519 midsagittal cineradiographic images of a\nFrench speaker uttering ten sentences \u0001Bothorel et al., 1986\u0002.\nThe analysis revealed that seven articulatory parameters \u0001Pi,\ni\u0001 \u00071, . . . ,7\b\u0002 could account for 88% of the variance of the\ntongue contours \u0001Bo\u00eb et al., 1995\u0002: labial protrusion, labial\naperture, tongue tip position, tongue body position, tongue\ndorsum position, jaw height, and larynx height. Each param-\neter is adjustable at a value in the range of \u00b13.5 standard\ndeviations around the mean values for this articulator in the\ncineradiographic images. These parameters control the posi-\ntion of the articulators in the model, and hence the midsag-\nittal contour. The cross-sectional area function is computed\nfrom the midsagittal contour following the Heinz and\nStevens \u00011965\u0002 formula and the transfer function is calcu-\nlated following the Badin and Fant \u00011984\u0002 model. VLAM\nintegrates nonuniform vocal tract growth, in the longitudinal\ndimension, by two scaling factors: one for the oral cavity and\nanother for the pharyngeal cavity, the zone in-between being\ninterpolated. The values of the factors, from 0.3 to 1.2, were\ncalibrated year by year and month by month based on Gold-\nstein\u2019s \u00011980\u0002 length data.\nTwo sets of maximal vowel spaces were simulated, with\nthe first set representing very limited articulatory movement\n\u0001henceforth limited range simulation\u0002 and the second repre-\nsenting the full range of movement for all seven articulatory\nparameters \u0001henceforth full range simulation\u0002. The limited\nrange simulation was accomplished by generating the acous-\ntic properties of all vowels that could be produced given the\nfull range of variation in the jaw and lip height movements,\nwhile holding tongue tip position, tongue body position, and\nlarynx height in the neutral position. The full range simula-\ntion was accomplished by generating the acoustic properties\nof all vowels that could be produced given the full range of\nvariation in all seven articulatory parameters.\nFIG. 3.

Results and discussion\nThe resulting vowel spaces for the 6-, 12-, and 18\n-month vocal tracts were described using the same proce-\ndures outlined above for experiment 1. These values for the\nsimulated vowel spaces are shown in Table I, with the lim-\nited range simulation represented in the upper half and the\nfull range simulation represented in the lower half of the\ntable. Changes in these values with age, especially as shown\nfor the limited range simulation, largely reflect increasing\nlength of the vocal tract. As would be expected, MF1 and\nMF2 decrease with age although the decreases shown are\nquite small, less than 50 mels on average. Changes in the\ncorners of the vowel space with age are also quite small,\ndecreasing less than 50 mels for each feature. Most change\noccurred to the grave and acute features. The compact fea-\nture shows the smallest degree of age related change in the\nsimulation as it did for the acoustic measures reported in\nexperiment 1. Changes in the acoustic characteristics of the\nvowel space from the limited range simulation to the full\nrange simulation reflect the increase in the range of vowels\nthat the infant could produce, given full range of movement\nof all articulators. As shown in the lower part of Table I,\nsmall decreases in Mf1 and MF2 occurred although a large\nincrease in SD F2 is shown. Substantial decreases in the\ngrave and compact features and a small increase in the dif-\nfuse feature are also apparent when comparing the limited\nrange with the full range simulation. Thus these simulations\nmodeled the expected expansion of the infant vowel space\nand suggest that this expansion occurs as a consequence of\nimproved speech motor control.\nIV. GENERAL DISCUSSION\nA. Developmental changes\nThe most obvious developmental change for the English\nand French infants was an expansion of the vowel space,\nespecially with respect to the grave and diffuse features. In\naddition to being consistent with previous findings \u0001e.g.,\nBuhr, 1980; Gilbert et al., 1997; Kent and Murray, 1982;\nRobb et al., 1997; Rvachew et al., 1996\u0002, these changes are a\npredictable consequence of developmental changes in the in-\nfant\u2019s ability to control tongue tip, tongue body, and tongue\ndorsum position, independently of jaw height, as indicated\nby the simulations reported in experiment 2 and shown in\nTable I, when comparing the limited and full range simula-\ntions.\nImproved control of the jaw during the infant period\nshould manifest itself as less extreme jaw displacement dur-\ning the opening and closing phases of syllable production\n\u0001Green et al., 2000\u0002. More control of the jaw in the midopen\nposition should result in less extreme acuteness values \u0001i.e.,\nreductions in maximum F1+F2\/2\u0002 and greater compactness\nvalues \u0001i.e., decreases in minimum F2\u2212F1\u0002. Figure 3 \u0001bot-\ntom left\u0002 confirms a statistically significant reduction in\nacuteness values. No clear developmental effects on com-\npactness values were observed however.\nFIG. 4.

Cross-linguistic differences\nA priori predictions about likely cross-linguistic differ-\nences were much more difficult to formulate because no pre-\nvious studies have compared vowels produced by Canadian-\nEnglish- and Canadian-French-learning infants.\nde Boysson-Bardies et al. \u00011989\u0002 reported a similar mean F1\nbut a slightly higher mean F2 for the vowel spaces of\n10-month-old infants exposed to British English compared to\nthe vowel spaces of infants exposed to Parisian French. The\n10-month-old infants enrolled in this study showed a similar\npattern of differences in mean formant frequencies. We ex-\npected to see a linear divergence of the center of the vowel\nspaces with age; however, an unexpected interaction of age\nand language group was observed: MF2 decreased in the\nCanadian-English group while the MF2 remained stable\nacross age for the Canadian-French group. Cross-linguistic\ndifferences were also observed in MF1 as the children grew\nolder: MF1 decreased in both groups but the decrease was\nmuch greater for the Canadian-French infants than for the\nCanadian-English group. Although some decrease in MF1\nand MF2 is expected as the infant\u2019s vocal tract lengthens, the\ndecrease in MF1 observed for the Canadian-French group\nand the decrease in MF2 observed for the Canadian-English\ngroup were each much larger than would be predicted on the\nbasis of vocal tract growth alone \u0001see Table I, experiment 2\u0002.\nIt is possible that the observed interaction of age and lan-\nguage group on MF2 might be due to differences in vowel\ninventory. English has fewer front vowels and no rounded\nfront vowels, in contrast to French which has three rounded\nfront vowels and three unrounded front vowels, with the\nfront vowels having higher F2 than back vowels. The F2\ndecrease in the CE group might be due to the combined\neffects of vocal tract growth and increased frequency of back\nvowels, thus decreasing F2. While a similar decrease in F2\nmay occur in the CF group for the same reasons, the effect\nmay be balanced by a greater frequency of front vowels,\nresulting in a stable MF2 across age in this language group.\nOur findings of a decrease in formant frequencies with\nage is not consistent with the earlier findings of Gilbert\net al. \u00011997\u0002 and Robb et al. \u00011997\u0002 who found that F1 and\nF2 remained stable across age. This difference in findings\nacross studies may be accounted for by utterance selection.\nIn their papers, Gilbert et al. \u00011997\u0002 and Robb et al. \u00011997\u0002\nacknowledge that possible changes in F1 and F2 may have\nbeen obscured by nasal resonance in the younger children\u2019s\nvocalizations. In the present study we controlled for this by\nonly analyzing vowels with normal phonation and full reso-\nnance.\nA cross-linguistic difference was also observed for the\nSD F2, with the Canadian-English infants showing an in-\ncrease with age in the range of F2 values \u0001as has been re-\nported in other studies; e.g., Robb et al., 1997; Rvachew et\nal., 1996\u0002. The Canadian-French infants did not show this\npattern of change for SD F2 however.\nC. Future directions\nThese results demonstrate significant developmental\nchanges in the shape of the infant vowel space as well as\nsignificant impacts of the auditory environment on the fre-\nquency location of the center of the infant vowel space.\nThese patterns of developmental change and cross-linguistic\ndifferences appear to emerge after 12 months of age but are\nclearly evident before 18 months of age. The observed indi-\nvidual differences in vowel production are undoubtedly ex-\nplained by a complex interaction of factors, including chang-\ning vocal tract morphology, developing speech motor\ncontrol, and the child\u2019s intake of self- and other-produced\nspeech. More research is required to understand how these\nfactors determine infant speech output.\nRecent technological advances, such as magnetic reso-\nnance imaging and computational modeling, allow us to\nmake predictions about the impact of changing vocal tract\nmorphology on the acoustic characteristics of speech output.\nMore direct observation of infant articulatory movements are\nrequired however, in order to better model the impact of\nlimited speech motor control along with the limitations im-\nposed by the size and shape of the infant\u2019s vocal tract. Kine-\nmatic studies of jaw and lip movements indicate that matu-\nration of speech motor control is not a linear process. For\nexample, after examining the correlation between the spa-\ntiotemporal trajectories for adult and child jaw movements\nduring bisyllable productions, Green et al. \u00012002\u0002 concluded\nthat jaw movements appear to be more adultlike at the end of\nthe first year, than at the end of the second year. Reduced\nstability of jaw movements at the later age may be due to the\nchallenge of developing independent control of other articu-\nlators or the challenge of producing speech for communica-\ntive purposes.\nThe cross-linguistic differences that were observed in\nthis study are difficult to interpret. Presumably, the speech\nthat is heard by the infant provides targets for speech pro-\nduction that shape the specific characteristics of the infant\u2019s\nspeech output. The exact nature of these targets is unknown.\nAlthough the acoustic characteristics of adult-produced\nCanadian-English and Canadian-French vowels have been\ndescribed \u0001Escudero and Polka, 2003\u0002, these kinds of de-\nscriptions are not well suited to the task of understanding the\ntarget for infant speech production. First, these descriptions\nare based on adult-directed speech, and it has been shown\nthat the acoustic-phonetic nature of infant-directed speech is\nsignificantly different from that of adult-directed speech\n\u0001Kuhl et al., 1997\u0002. In particular, the talker\u2019s vowel space\nwhen addressing an infant is larger, with more extreme point\nvowels, in comparison with the vowel space produced in an\nadult-directed register. Second, adult-produced speech is\nusually described in relation to specific phonetic targets. For\nexample, Escudero and Polka \u00012003\u0002 found that the\nCanadian-English \u0003u\u0004 is considerably less grave than the\nCanadian-French \u0003u\u0004, while the Canadian-English \u0003\u00e6\u0004 is\nmore acute that the Canadian-French \u0003\u00e6\u0004. However, since it\nis not possible to ask infants to produce a specific vowel, the\ninfant vowel space is always described in terms of more\nglobal characteristics as we have done here. We are currently\nengaged in an effort to describe infant-directed speech from\nCanadian-French- and Canadian-English-speaking parents,\nin terms of the center and corners of their vowels spaces.\nThis kind of information may facilitate the development of\n8 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 120, No. 4, October 2006 Rvachew et al.: Developmental and cross-linguistic variation\n  PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \n  PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \n \n PROOF COPY 023610JAS  \nspecific predictions about cross-linguistic differences in in-\nfant vowel production across different language groups.\nThe infant\u2019s access to self-produced speech must also be\nconsidered. The development of speech motor control re-\nquires that the infant develop a mapping between auditory-\nperceptual targets, articulatory gestures, and the acoustic-\nphonetic product of those articulatory movements \u0001Callan et\nal., 2000\u0002. This model of speech development highlights the\nimportance of feedback of the infant\u2019s own speech. A better\nunderstanding of how the infant processes this feedback is\nnecessary if we are to predict patterns of developmental\nchange in speech production. Investigating the role of visual\nspeech \u0001e.g., the visual cues for production of different vow-\nels\u0002 is another avenue for further research.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study we described the vowel spaces produced by\ninfants in terms of the center and the corners of the vowel\nspace. The infants were drawn from two language groups,\nCanadian English and Canadian French, and covered a broad\nage range, from 10 to 18 months. The findings were inter-\npreted in relation to simulations of vowel production given\ndifferences in vocal tract length and speech motor control.\nSome individual differences in the vowel spaces, such as an\nexpansion of the vowel space into the diffuse and grave re-\ngions, were associated with ageing of the infant. These de-\nvelopmental changes appear to reflect maturation of the vo-\ncal tract and speech motor control. Other differences were\nassociated with the infant\u2019s ambient language environment.\nInfants exposed to Canadian French demonstrated a decline\nin mean first formant frequencies whereas infants exposed to\nCanadian English showed a decline in mean second formant\nfrequencies with age. The divergence of the vowel spaces\nbetween the two language groups emerged between 12 and\n18 months of age. In order to understand the mechanism by\nwhich the ambient speech environment influences infant\nspeech production, future research should attempt to link the\ncharacteristics of infant vowels to the infant\u2019s perception of\nboth adult- and self-produced speech.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported by research grants from the\nCanadian Language and Literacy Research Network and the\nNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of\nCanada to the first author and a postdoctoral fellowship to\nthe second author from the Centre for Research in Language,\nMind and Brain. The authors thank the infants and their\nfamilies for their participation, Voula Tsagaroulis for audio-\nmetric testing, Jade Heilmann for recruiting and data collec-\ntion, Pi-Yu Chiang, Jessica Whittley, Shani Abada, and\nHeather McKinnon for digitizing the speech samples, and\nMarie Desmarteau and Sara Turner for acoustic analysis.\nBadin, P., and Fant, G. \u00011984\u0002. \u201cNotes on vocal tract computation,\u201d Speech\nTransmission Laboratory\u2014Quarterly Progress Status Report, Vol. 2\u20133,\n53\u2013108.\nBo\u00eb, L.-J., Gabioud, B., and Perrier, P. \u00011995\u0002. \u201cThe SMIP: An interactive\narticulatory-acoustic software for speech production studies,\u201d Bulletin de\nla Communication Parl\u00e9e 3, 137\u2013154.\nBothorel, A., Simon, P., Wioland, F., and Zerling, J.
