By E.M. HANNON and A. FLYNN, Department of Food and Nutritional Science, University\nCollege Cork, Cork, Republic of Ireland\nThe objective of the present study was to estimate the contribution of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals\n(RTEBC) to macro- and micronutrient intakes in Irish children aged 5\u201312 years, using data from the\nNational Children\u2019s Food Survey (NCFS). The NCFS was carried out between April 2003 and April\n2004 to establish a database of habitual food and drink consumption in a representative sample of Irish\nchildren aged 5\u201312 years. A 7 d weighed-food record was used to collect food-intake data (including\nsupplements) from 594 children (293 boys, 301 girls). Analysis of dietary intake data was carried out\nusing WISPg (Tinuviel Software, Llanfechell, Anglesey, UK), which contains data from McCance and\nWiddowson\u2019s The Composition of Foods, 6th Edition1.\nApproximately 95% of boys and 91% of girls were RTEBC consumers and the average daily\nintake in consumers was 39 g (boys) and 27 g (girls).\nContribution of RTEBC\nBoys 5\u201312 years (n 293) Girls 5\u201312 years (n 301)\nContribution\n% total\nContribution\n% totalMean SD Mean SD\nEnergy 0.59 MJ 0.42 MJ 7.8 0.39 MJ 0.31 MJ 5.8\nMacronutrients\nProtein 2.9 g 2.4 g 4.9 1.9 g 1.6 g 3.5\nTotal fat 1.0 g 1.7 g 1.5 0.6 g 0.7 g 1.0\nSaturated fat 0.3 g 0.5 g 1.1 0.2 g 0.2 g 0.8\nCarbohydrate 30.9 g 21.4 g 12.4 20.5 g 16.6 g 9.4\nTotal sugars 8.1 g 8.4 g 7.3 5.7 g 5.9 g 6.0\nStarch 22.7 g 15.7 g 17.6 14.8 g 12.2 g 13.0\nMicronutrients\nFe 3.7 mg 2.9 mg 33.3 2.4 mg 2.2 mg 26.6\nFolate 64.9mg 50.2mg 26.5 44.8mg 39.6mg 21.1\nThiamin 0.4 mg 0.3 mg 26.4 0.3 mg 0.2 mg 20.7\nRiboflavin 0.5 mg 0.4 mg 24.2 0.3 mg 0.3 mg 19.1\nVitamin B6 0.5 mg 0.5 mg 23.7 0.4 mg 0.3 mg 19.8\nNiacin 6.0 mg 4.4 mg 19.4 4.0 mg 3.4 mg 14.9\nIn relation to their percentage contribution to mean daily intakes (MDI) of energy, RTEBC\ncontribute lower percentages of MDI of protein, total fat and saturated fat, higher percentages of MDI of\ntotal carbohydrate and starch and the same percentage of MDI of total sugars. RTEBC contribute\nsignificant percentages of MDI (including supplements) of Fe, folate, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and\nniacin (boys 19\u201333%, girls 15\u201327%).\nThe study was funded by Kelloggs.\n1.

Cambridge: Royal Society\nof Chemistry.\nA systematic review of the effect of nutrition, diet and dietary change on learning, behaviour\nand performance of school-aged children. By F.C. HILLER1, L.J. ELLS1, C.D. SUMMERBELL1, J.\nSHUCKSMITH1, H. CRAWLEY2, L.S. HARBIGE3, J. HAMILTON-SHIELD4 and A. WIGGINS5,\n1School of Health and Social Care, University of Teesside, Middlesbrough TS1 3BA, UK, 2School of\nLife Sciences, Kingston University, Kingston-upon-Thames KT1 1LQ, UK, 3School of Science,\nUniversity of Greenwich, Kent ME4 4TB, UK, 4Institute of Child Health, University of Bristol, Bristol,\nBS8 1TH, UK and 5CEM Centre, Durham University, Durham DH1 3UZ, UK\nThe Department for Education and Skills and the Food Standards Agency are committed to promoting\nhealthier schools and lifestyles among schoolchildren, through improving the quality of school meals\nand national nutritional standards1. Whilst this commitment is primarily made on health grounds2,3, there\nis considerable interest in how good nutrition may also impact on behaviour, learning and performance.\nHowever, the current evidence base to support clear associations in this area is confusing and lacks\ncohesion. This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of nutrition, diet and dietary change on\nlearning, behaviour and performance in school-aged children (4\u201318 years) from the UK and other\ndeveloped countries.\nMEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychinfo, BEI, ERIC, Australian ERIC, SSCI, ASSIA, International\nBibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, SPECTRE and ZETOC were searched. All\npeer-reviewed randomised case or cluster controlled trials undertaken in children from developed\ncountries providing an exposure or intervention focusing on nutrition, diet or dietary change (achievable\nby diet alone) and at least one of the following outcomes were investigated: educational performance;\nbehaviour; motivation.\nTwenty-nine studies were included. Fifteen studies examined the effect of breakfast, of which\nten identified an association between breakfast provision and some small cognitive and behavioural\nimprovements. Six studies examined the effect of short-term exposure to sugar intake in populations of\npredominantly sufferers of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. No dramatic detrimental effects on\neducational or behavioural outcomes were observed. Five studies investigated the effect of fish oil\nsupplementation in a population with symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the findings\nwere mixed and therefore inconclusive. Two studies examined the effect of vitamin and mineral\nsupplementation: one showed a significant positive effect on IQ in a small sub sample; the other found\nno effect. The final study examined \u2018good diet\u2019 in the first year of school, but lacked sufficient detail and\nquality to inform the evidence base. Several studies lacked quality in research methodology and\nreporting (particularly those investigating breakfast consumption). Many studies failed to account for\nimportant confounders, such as habitual dietary intake, physical activity levels, locality and family\ncontext, whilst two-thirds of the studies were carried out in primary-aged children and over half took\nplace over a short duration (<1 month).\nFindings suggest there is insufficient evidence to identify any effect of nutrition, diet and dietary\nchange on learning, education or performance of school-aged children from the developed world.\nFurther research is required that must be of high quality, representative of all populations, undertaken for\nlonger durations and use universal standardised measures of educational attainment. Challenges in terms\nof interpreting the results of such studies within the context of confounders such as family and\ncommunity context, poverty, disease and the rate of individual maturation and neurodevelopment will\nremain.\nThis research was funded by the Food Standards Agency.
